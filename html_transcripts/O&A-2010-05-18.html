<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic physical altercation between Bobo and Johnny Fairplay over a stolen Mets hat, escalating into a slapstick fight. Bobo's emotional state was explained by an upcoming reunion with a half-brother he hadn't seen in 23 years, a relationship previously limited to online interaction.  The hosts and Bobo engaged in crude and sexually suggestive humor about this reunion.  The conversation then transitioned to the challenges of new parenthood and sleep deprivation, with Opie recounting anecdotes about his newborn's unusual noises and discussing Jay Moore's parenting book.  Significant airtime was devoted to the Stone Temple Pilots' unprofessionalism, including a canceled interview and past negative experiences, corroborated by a caller's firsthand account of Scott Weiland's lateness and unprofessional conduct at a concert.  This was contrasted with the positive experience of working with Slash. The hosts also discussed various rock biographies, including those of Slash and Ozzy Osbourne.  Finally, they aired their frustration with booking difficulties, contrasting their current lineup (including George Wendt) with high-profile individuals who had declined to appear, and recounted a past guest appearance by Jade Vixen, a Penthouse Pet, revealing an unexpected life event not disclosed pre-interview.

The upcoming interview with George Wendt, promoting his book "Drinking with George," was a central theme, beginning with the hosts' frustration over the lack of readily available review copies.  This irritation was compounded by the Stone Temple Pilots' (referred to with a vulgar term) cancelled interview.  Producer Troy Kwan, filling in for Anthony due to a stress fracture, hosted "Tattoo Talk with Troy," featuring graphic descriptions of his tattoo work, including various piercings, particularly Prince Albert piercings and other genital piercings, along with a bizarre encounter with a swinger couple.  Other guests mentioned or scheduled included Mike Baker (CIA veteran) and Nestor Carbonell (actor).  The "F.U. Line" segment showcased numerous vulgar voicemails.  The interview with George Wendt finally commenced, involving humorous exchanges about his recent bowel movement, his *Cheers* character, his finances, family life, and his continued drinking habits.

The George Wendt interview centered on his new book, "Drinking with George," his weight struggles, and his experiences on *Cheers*, including his relationship with Kirstie Alley and her weight. The conversation repeatedly circled back to Wendt's drinking, his thoughts on rehab, and his longest period of sobriety. He revealed that the beer on *Cheers* was non-alcoholic, except for occasional instances near the end of filming.  A caller recounted an intoxicated cast party after a *Cheers* episode aired in Boston. Wendt confirmed the book's focus and his preference for traditional beers. The interview concluded with Wendt appearing unhappy, prompting speculation about his drinking and sadness from the hosts, before transitioning to a blind gossip segment and a Radio Shack parody.

A lengthy on-air argument between staff members Danny and Kenny dominated a significant portion, stemming from Kenny's strict enforcement of backstage access rules.  The argument devolved into personal attacks regarding musical tastes and perceived favoritism.  This tension carried over into Kenny's "Blind Items with Club Soda Kenny" segment, resulting in further strained interactions and suggestive blind items about staff. Mike Baker, the CIA veteran, then joined the show, discussing interrogation techniques (including waterboarding), the CIA's role in counterterrorism, information sharing, and clandestine operations overseas.  He also commented on the cultural shift in information sharing and media attention.

The segment with Mike Baker continued, touching on harsh interrogation techniques, the capture of Osama bin Laden, the changing nature of al-Qaeda, and humorous tangents about bin Laden's potential romantic relationships.  The "F.U. Line" returned, followed by a brief interview with Nestor Carbonell (from *Lost*), promoting the show's final episodes.  The conversation returned to Mike Baker, covering his private security work, the challenges of keeping his CIA career secret, and his views on conspiracy theories, specifically the death of Stan Meyer and the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. He shared anecdotes about concealing his past.

The final segment heavily featured a discussion about government conspiracies and the flaws of those in power, contemplating mandatory government service. The argument between Kenny and Danny continued, with Mike Baker offering body language analysis of Kenny, drawing parallels between government operations and the show's internal dynamics. A caller, John from D.C., questioned Mike's disclosures, raising concerns about sensitive information.  A debate ensued about balancing classified information protection and public discussion.  The conversation concluded with discussion of Mike's future projects, including a *Deadliest Warriors* episode.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Let's bring in Johnny Fairplay.  Bobo.  Johnny Fairplay.  I think he's got to disguise himself.  He's so popular.  You're not a fan of the Fairplay.  I just hate this guy.  I just have nothing about this guy.  Alright.  What's wrong, Sam?  Come on in.  Sam, what's wrong?  I'm just walking up the hallway and hearing Bobo chase after him going, 
[00:00:30]  How was that being on Survivor?  Really?  Because I realized who he was.  Oh, did you?  Whoa, Bobo without a hat.  Bobo, look at you.  Bobo almost looks normal.  You look normal without that Mets hat, Bobo.  My brother is in town, that's why.  What does that have to do with the price of tomatoes?  Yeah, why is your hair all moosed out?  You look all nice.  I haven't seen my brother since my father passed away.  Oh, really?  He's my half-brother.  Alright, Bobo, walk us through it, slowly. 
[00:01:00]  My father had a previous marriage prior to my mother.  Right.  And they had that kid, Brian.  That you're going to meet for the first time today in 23 years.  Yeah, that I've only been talking to on the internet.  Okay.  So how do you know you already know you want to fuck him?  No, no, no, no, no.  You haven't met him.  They're twisting that.  I didn't say that part.  Is he down for this or is it just you?  I didn't say the effing part, alright?  You're going to force yourself on your own brother.  No, no, no, no.  I hope he's into this.  Don't make me call him right now. 
[00:01:30]  You said your brother could fart out ping pong balls out of his asshole.  No, I didn't say that.  I did not say that.  I said I could probably do that.  Bobo found you out and knocked the hat off Johnny Fairfax.  That's it.  Knock off his hat.  Knock off his hat.  That's it.  That's it.  Oh, damn.  Would you like to give me that back now?  Uh-oh.  Pre-fight hype.  Here we go.  No, I'll give it back to you after Jimmy Forts in it. 
[00:02:00]  Who's Jimmy?  Jimmy's not even here.  Jimmy's not here.  Well, I'm holding on to it until the next time he's here.  Then you'll get it back farted on.  Oh!  Holy shit.  I'm shipping it to you, Priority Mail, same day, Priority Mail.  Same day.  I'm going to have him farted on multiple times.  Multiple times farted on.  I'm going to have him eat.  I'll give Jimmy the hundred case, the White Castle Sliders. 
[00:02:30]  I'm going to punch you in the stomach if you don't give me that.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  No, no, no.  I'm honestly going to put on the boxing glove and punch you in the stomach if I don't have  my hat back.  In what time?  You're going to put a time frame on it.  Well, if you do that, I'm going to...  He's putting his view on it.  I'm not going to explain why my brother...  Johnny, fair play is going for the glove.  Stand your ground, Bobo.  Johnny, show him what's what.  You did it go UFC on me.  Bobo, put your dukes up.  Hey, don't want to hurt the guy before...  Protect yourself at all times. 
[00:03:00]  Don't want to hurt the brother before the main event.  There.  Here we go.  Dukes are up.  Dukes are up.  I'm just going to punch you in the stomach, all right?  Dukes are up.  Dukes are up.  You ready?  You ready?  Okay.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  What did you do?  All right.  Stop.  Oh, shit.  Jesus, fair play.  Fair play laid into Bobo's song.  Bobo, you all right?  Oh, there's a jam to the face.  That's another one.  That's a gun for the face.  All right.  Don't try to hold Bobo back. 
[00:03:30]  Don't try to hold him back.  Bobo's punching Johnny Fair play.  Oh, my God.  It's a catastrophe.  Fair play is down.  Bobo.  Bobo, okay.  Bobo, fight back.  Don't just...  Bobo.  Bobo.  I think you're good.  I think you better quit while you're behind.  Wow.  I don't want any questions here, John.  He was going right for the face, too, wasn't he?  What the fuck?  Jesus.  The O.B. and Anthony show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  You didn't sleep either, Jimmy? 
[00:04:00]  No.  I've not been feeling great, and I've had a bad sleep schedule.  You know how it is.  You with the baby with me.  It's a day to psycho.  Whatever.  Whatever.  So, uh...  Not much sleep?  Nah, not at all.  So we're both not sleeping?  No, I was also cleaning up shit.  She started looking at this.  Her mom started peering?  Oh, yeah.  Like, it was a science project.  Like, she was completely amazed at what was going on.  You don't want to...  And, um... 
[00:04:30]  And...  I'll tell you this.  I...  Our penises are fucking a joke.  They're a joke.  Right?  When you think you're...  When you think you're hurting a woman with your penis, stop.  Just get that out of your mind.  I hurt women emotionally when I fuck them.  Is that why you don't drink, Sam?  Because you're afraid of what would happen?  That's it.  Just a couple of beers in.  A couple of beers in, and he'd be all over the cock.  No.  Sam would be loving the cock after two beers.  You'd think after two beers, it's sloppy. 
[00:05:00]  Two fucking beers.  Sloppy party bottom time for Sam.  Two beers, and Sam would just be like,  I don't know why I just didn't grab...  I love the cock.  He would make this noise while he sucked it.  He would take the cock in his mouth and put his tongue under the balls and go...  He's got a weird voice.  His hair is like a fucking Lego person.  It's a cartoon voice, though.  It's almost like a lisp thing, but then there's a talking, kind of a nasal voice thing.  And he's dumb, too. 
[00:05:30]  He's dumb as dirt.  You really are.  You are dumb.  You're a dummy.  You're really a dummy.  How did you get through school being so stupid?  I'm not dumb.  I go to Stony Brook.  Like, what?  That's a good score.  Opie and Anthony.  Live.  Next.  A go to Stony Brook. 
[00:06:00]  And we willél.  And we have to let him try...  ...  ...  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up. Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:10:00]  Let's do that.  Let's do that.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I think eventually this show is just going to be franchised.  I think it's just going to be called Opie and Anthony, but it's going to be completely different people.  I think eventually we, the three main players just fade out.  It'll be three guys and we'll just insist they call themselves Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  Travis, Danny and Mars.  Probably.  I say that because today Anthony's out.  So, as long as you get two out of three, I think it's a show. 
[00:10:30]  I'm fucking tired though, man.  I don't have the new rhythm yet.  I got to get into a rhythm.  You have a kid waking up every two hours.  Feeding him?  No, man.  I mean, she wants to do all the breastfeeding.  I'm like, I'll do a bottle.  I'll give you a break.  Because if I do one bottle, then she gets four hours of solid sleep instead of waking up every hour and a half. 
[00:11:00]  Something like that.  And the damn kid makes all sorts of animal noises.  You learn so much.  And I'm reading Jay Moore's new book.  Jay Moore's new book came out perfect.  Perfect.  I have a kid and Jay Moore has this freaking book about being a parent.  It's perfect for me.  It's good, right?  We had him in and some of it was really funny, man.  Honestly, his new book, I'm three, four chapters in.  I'm loving it.  But then again, it's hitting close to home because I just had a kid. 
[00:11:30]  But it also explains your parents a little bit.  And, you know, Jay's a good writer and a funny guy.  And he's helping me sleep better at night because the first few nights I had the kid home,  I'm hearing all sorts of animal noises through the monitor.  This means nothing to you, Jimmy, and I understand that.  But out there in Radioland, people will be like, holy shit, that happens to you too?  You actually hear animal noises coming from the baby monitors.  Like, what the hell?  Is he choking? 
[00:12:00]  Is he turning blue?  What's going on tonight?  And Jay Moore explains in his book, that's exactly what kids do.  They make all sorts of noises.  And they don't tell you this when you bring the kid home from the hospital.  You know, you have a kid and you're in the hospital two days where they have around-the-clock coverage  with, like, expert nurses that have been watching babies for, I don't know, 20, 30 years.  And you sort of see the kid while you're in the hospital for two days and then they say,  okay, you're ready to raise this thing?  You know, that situation?  But they don't tell you within that little time you have with the experts 
[00:12:30]  that the kid is going to make animal noises and it's perfectly fine.  And I had to learn that from Jay Moore's book.  And then I did a little research on my own and said, yeah, yeah, yeah,  it's going to sound like a fucking zoo coming from the nursery  or wherever you keep the kid at night.  So that was helpful.  I held a baby yesterday.  Steve and MJ brought their baby.  You're holding his baby, but you haven't seen mine?  You happen to bring it.  It's a little older.  You don't even like Steve.  His incompetence as a producer. 
[00:13:00]  Apparently his sperm does work.  That's not true, is it?  I'm fucking jealous.  Jimmy held your baby before mine, Steve.  I would have the place for your baby.  And I literally, I haven't been feeling well.  And God forbid you walk across the street.  You make it sound like you live, I don't know, on the other side of town.  No, but if they brought the baby in,  I figure that means that the baby is okay to be around people.  But I'll go over there today.  I feel okay today.  You feel all right?  Yeah, I just don't want to be like, you don't want to get the kids.  There really is something to be said for a two-day-old baby or a week-old baby. 
[00:13:30]  It's like.  You know, I got the sanitizer all over my house.  I think I'm going to force you to take a shower.  No, I'll just, you know.  You're going to walk in the door.  I'm going to lead you to a shower.  And we're going to hose you down.  I would be too nervous holding a week-old baby.  His baby, MJ just kind of said, you want to hold it?  My kid's not a week-old baby.  Two weeks.  I mean, technically, I guess.  It's pushing 10 pounds already.  That's true.  Most babies go home at 6 1⁄2, 7 pounds.  I think that's about average.  Mine's 9 and something.  It's weird.  I never felt like I was holding a newborn with my son. 
[00:14:00]  It's really weird.  Like, it was very, it was, I didn't, I don't really move.  I just kind of sit there and hold the kid.  I always do it seated because it's what you can't talk to.  Yeah, and all your muscles just tense up and you feel like you're going to drop it.  Yeah, and you're afraid that the head.  Yeah.  But you can't tell by the facial expression.  You know, we couldn't tell if the kid was really having, you know, fun or if he just hated it.  There's no way to tell.  I also learned from, yeah, you're right.  I also learned from Jay's book that don't even bother doing anything significant with your kid until he's about 8. 
[00:14:30]  Because that's when he basically starts remembering things.  Do you remember anything past the age of, let's say, 7?  Not really good things, I don't think.  I don't think I remember anything great.  I think I sort of remember kindergarten.  Sort of.  So that's, what, 5?  Yeah.  So I think my memory starts at 5.  So whatever my parents did with me before the age of 5, that was a waste of time.  And I just want to tell my mom, who's probably listening.  A complete waste of time.  When I was 5, Mrs. Slavic pinched my ear and yelled at me for, she would pull my ear and she yelled at me for picking my nose and idiot. 
[00:15:00]  I do remember that.  You do remember that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember her hairdo.  Yeah, she was a fat lady.  And how old?  Whatever kindergarten is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have very weird memories of that age.  So yeah, I have, but nothing significant until that 7 or 8.  Right.  I also learned from Jay's book, and this is very early on.  I don't want to give away all the punchlines though, but I want to help promote his book for him because I'm liking it.  And that he and that lovely bride of his, Nicky Cox, they wore adult diapers for a goof. 
[00:15:30]  Wait.  Exactly.  For like how long?  Just for a night, I guess, just to see how it feels.  And then, you know.  Do they piss in them?  Well, I'm not going to give away the whole story.  But basically, Jay was diaper shopping, and you learn, you do learn when you go diaper shopping that there's a whole aisle of diapers.  Not just a few brands.  It's a whole aisle.  And in that aisle is also adult diapers.  So he figured, you know what?  I want to see what the big deal is. 
[00:16:00]  Wow.  And he's all for wearing adult diapers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Especially if you have a long, you know, car ride.  Because it does soak up things nicely.  I always wondered that.  I'm like, how well could it keep you dry?  The absorption is amazing on diapers.  Is it?  Yeah.  How nice would it be to just lay in bed and piss?  Yeah.  Well, that's what he says.  He says, you know, we'd get a lot more sleep.  Because a lot of us get up in the middle of the night to take our leaks, right?  I don't know if I could do it, though.  But I would like to try it once. 
[00:16:30]  Like the crazy astronaut who drove cross-country to stalk her ex-boyfriend.  Pissing and shitting her pants across the country.  How about in honor of Jay Moore's book, we'd do it today.  What else are we going to do?  We don't have STP.  You know, I don't care about that band at all.  I literally, if you put a gun up my head and said, name me an STP song.  I know who they are, but I cannot name you one STP.  They just never were relevant to me.  Well, I tweeted yesterday, and I think you tweeted it, too.  I'm officially following you.  You know that, right?  Right.  Because, yeah, there's controversy out there because I wasn't following you guys. 
[00:17:00]  But you're part of my list called Funny Peeps.  You can make lists on Twitter, and you're in the Funny Peeps section.  But we were supposed to interview STP, or we thought we had a good chance of interviewing those guys.  And we learned that they are going to be too tired to do our radio show today.  They're going to do Howard.  You know, they're going to do the King's show.  And then after that, I think they're doing Alt Nation.  And they're going to be too tired to do our show. 
[00:17:30]  And I'll tell you right now, we have a hell of a lot more people listening to us than Alt Nation.  Absolutely.  So I don't know what the fuck they're thinking.  Doing Stern is one thing because that's like if they know, if that's a relationship they have, they did that and were leaving.  Whatever.  That's that they wanted to, they're willing to get up for that guy they like.  Fuck it.  But when they're going to do Alt Nation, which has a lot less people than this channel, it's like, fuck.  Then they're going to be staying, so fuck them.  Right.  You know, and it hurts me because I am a big STP fan.  I know a lot of their songs. 
[00:18:00]  I've seen STP easily ten times.  Easily.  And we've supported them over the years.  The DeLeo brothers came in with a shitty side project, and we supported that.  Does anyone remember Army of Anyone?  I like them.  Oh, you like it?  Yeah, the single's actually really not bad at all.  You and what, a hundred people, though?  The band never took off.  I know, but you know what?  Hence why they all had to get back together and do the STP thing again.  I did give it a shot, because it sounded really good.  I mean, DeLeo brothers plus the dude from Filter. 
[00:18:30]  I can't remember his name.  I forgot his name, too.  I love that guy.  The lead singer of Filter is, you know what?  I probably shouldn't have said that, because he's a really cool dude.  But he will surface again, because he's too talented to keep down.  What's his name, though?  Richard Patrick.  Yeah, there you go.  Richard Patrick.  Richard Patrick.  I think they got back together.  Travis, do you know anything about that?  Did Filter get back together?  Yeah, I think, well, they opened for STP at that PNC show about two years ago.  Yeah, I do remember that.  Yeah, Patrick is.  They sounded great, too.  Patrick is a great, great vocalist, man. 
[00:19:00]  And the guy from, um.  But the army of anyone, it just didn't go where they wanted to go, and we supported that project for them.  Who's the guy from Rage who was in that?  Wasn't that guy from Rage Against the Machine there?  Or no.  Did they have a Rage guy in there, too?  I know they had the DeLeo brothers.  They had Patrick.  Are you thinking of Tom Morello?  Yeah, what was he in?  He was in Audioslave.  Oh, Audioslave.  Okay, okay.  No, that was, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, Audioslave I liked a lot, too.  So they've passed on us.  And this is the same, and it's like their album needs all the help it could get. 
[00:19:30]  Absolutely.  You know, it's not doing that well.  And somebody on Twitter was telling me that they've already released three singles from the new CD, and it's going nowhere.  So it needs all the promotion it could get.  So instead of doing this at Alt Nation, they're doing 90 minutes at Alt Nation.  Good.  This isn't, I don't know, 97, 98, 1998, where you don't really have to promote because they're fucking huge.  At this point, they need all the promotion they could get. 
[00:20:00]  So fuck them.  This is the band in Boston.  I'm tired of this bullshit.  This is the band in Boston that blew us off.  Scott Wyland was supposed to do an interview, and we were fucking on the air, and he's just like, he's a cunt.  He didn't want to come in.  He's a twat.  I bashed in my book, and fuck them.  We went all the way up to Boston just to interview the band, if you remember.  And we're sitting there on leather couches at the last minute.  They're like, yeah, they're not going to come out.  They're not, you know, they're whatever.  They're whatever.  Because whatever excuse they use, I know, is a bullshit excuse.  And then the debauchery at the PNC show, where, you know, there was an hour and a half, two hours in between the bands. 
[00:20:30]  And me and Kenny watched one of the DeLeo brothers yelling and screaming at the bus, screaming at Wyland, going, come on, Axl, come on.  Calling him Axl and stuff.  Wow.  And then there was yelling and screaming, and the word cunt was used a couple times.  And then he wandered on stage finally and put on a mediocre show at best because there was something going on with him that day. 
[00:21:00]  I hate temperamental musicians.  I hate.  I really do.  There's not many of them anymore, though.  There really isn't a lot of them left.  Did Mick Jagger pull that shit?  I don't know.  Of course not.  He just got people, like, killed in the front of the stage.  That was their fault.  That's what you get.  That's a white man's concert.  Fucking Jagger rules.  He fucking rules.  But, I mean, guys like that who really are professional. 
[00:21:30]  It's like, I hate the fucking baby rock star.  It drives me nuts.  Yeah.  It drives me.  The baby performer, I fucking hate it.  You know, it's like, they just need to be coddled and everybody's around them.  It's like, oh, no, you're right, you're right.  No one has the balls to tell them, look, you're just being a dick.  Then you and I in Boston on that stage, and we weren't allowed to, like, be, what, on the stage,  even though we were tucked away in a corner and Scott Wyland and the rest of them wouldn't even have noticed if we were on the stage. 
[00:22:00]  It's like, oh, no, they requested that the stage is completely clear before they walk off their buses.  And that drove you nuts.  Yeah, it did, because it was the show was being, like, the station was presenting the show.  We had gone up there with BCN and we were going to interview them.  They blew us off.  We should talk about that for a second, though, because, you know, I've done radio a long time.  And when you guys, meaning you out there, you hear a local rock station talking about, well, we're presenting, okay, STP. 
[00:22:30]  It's really not a give and take.  It's like the radio station kisses ass, kisses the band's ass, sells out the venue for them.  Maybe they'll give you the bass player to do a 10-minute interview with their afternoon jock, and that's it.  That's the interaction you get, even though it sounds like, you know, you're doing this together with the band.  Right.  And that's exactly what happened in Boston.  That's why I interrupted you.  Yeah, there was no band came in, no Weiland came in, but then just to be such twats about it, which was no one backstage in the area, you can't watch them get off the bus or walk on stage. 
[00:23:00]  Like, I've been backstage before.  They were being twats.  It wasn't rational.  It was just like they wanted the whole backstage area cleared.  Right.  I just put a bad taste in my mouth.  I don't know the music.  I know that they're supposedly great.  Fuck them.  I don't care.  If they broke up and never got back together, I wouldn't even know it.  Unless you tap me and go, oh, yeah, they broke up again.  Who fucking cares?  Right, right.  How interesting is Scott Weiland going to be? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, you know, man, it's the music.  We got back for the music.  Did you?  Did you?  If he even comes in.  Yeah.  I think he's tormented.  We even had his fucking ex-wife in here promoting her shitty book.  Remember she handed out chocolates to everybody?  Vaguely, yeah.  A nice enough woman.  I don't want to trash her, but we even supported that.  And even though they're not married anymore, they're still, you know, together.  They got a kid together and all that, so they're doing the right thing.  So we did the right thing by having her in as well. 
[00:24:00]  Holy shit.  Kevin in White Plains.  What's up, Kevin?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Now, I was at that show that you were talking about, the PNC Center show two years ago.  Mm-hmm.  And I remember, it was one of my friends, I was there, when they were an hour and a half  late to the stage, and Scott wouldn't come out, and he saw, like, ambulances plugged to  where they were, supposedly, backstage.  And everyone was talking that he had OD'd back there and was dead, and then there was  going to be no show.  So he rushed out to the parking lot, trying to get into his car, because he started to, 
[00:24:30]  like, beat it out there.  Missed the entire concert.  They came out, like, five minutes after he walked out.  They wouldn't let him back in.  He was just screwed.  Well, I saw something completely different, because I'm sitting in my seats, and I don't  know, it was at least a half hour, 45 minutes between the two bands, at least.  Probably closer to an hour at that point.  And I said to the people I was sitting with, I gotta go backstage, because I had a backstage  pass.  I'm gonna try to check out what's going on.  And I brought Kenny with me, and me and Kenny watched a whole scene outside Scott Weiland's 
[00:25:00]  bus.  And it wasn't ambulances.  It was one of the DeLeo brothers, because I don't know who's who.  And he's yelling and screaming and pacing up and down outside the bus.  Some woman came out, and she's giving the DeLeo brother some shit.  And then the word cunt was used.  And then he's screaming, oh, here's Kenny.  And then he's screaming, come on out, Axel, come on out.  Didn't he have a bodyguard in front of the bus that wouldn't let him on?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that part.  Thanks, Jimmy. 
[00:25:30]  So, yeah, the DeLeo brother, a big part of STP.  The bass player.  The bass player, was it?  Okay.  He wasn't allowed on Scott Weiland's bus, because Scott Weiland had his personal bouncer or bodyguard  guarding the entrance to the bus.  So as a band, they're not really even together, it seems to me.  It seems like they're separate parts that come together on stage, do their thing, and then  they split and go their own way.  And Howard should ask him about that, because that's a big thing that a lot of people know  about.  What else did you see that night, Kenny? 
[00:26:00]  I guess it was his girlfriend that he was yelling at and called her a cunt, and they  were screaming at each other.  Yeah.  And DeLeo was screaming to the bus, come on, Axel, you're not embarrassing me in my hometown.  Oh, I forgot about that, because, yeah, the DeLeo guys are from Jersey, so they're playing  at the PNC.  So this is a hometown gig for them.  So he's like, that's right.  And he goes, you're not going to embarrass me in front of my hometown crowd and my family,  my friends.  Come on, Axel.  Come on, Axel.  Right. 
[00:26:30]  It was a whole big scene back there.  Me and Kenny were loving it.  And then he finally comes out.  Yeah, like 10 minutes later, he came stumbling out in some outfit.  Some outfit.  Yeah.  Some, I'm from the 70s rock star outfit.  Yeah, like a velvet jacket and some fedora and leather pants.  That's how a rock star should dress.  Yuck.  Yeah, so.  Thanks, Kevin.  That's what we saw.  We were right on the scene there.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:27:00]  So it's just annoying that people are blown off our show for the dumbest reasons.  Yeah, I wonder if...  I mean, we have a real problem with the booking of this radio show, but, you know, I'll try  not to bitch, but we have serious issues as far as this radio show goes.  Not with us in studio here.  You know, I mean, the bookings suck for this radio show.  Suck.  We got George Wendt coming in today.  And I'm not trashing George Wendt, but what year is this? 
[00:27:30]  What is he coming in to promote?  And I'm sure he's a nice enough guy.  I've talked to him a few times over the years.  But it's like, where's the people from this century?  When are they going to start doing our show?  Well, he's promoting a book.  He's supposed to be very good.  So if they ask Anthony and I, we're like, yeah, we'll talk to George Wendt.  I don't mind that we're talking to George Wendt.  I'm actually excited.  But what are we going to ask him about Cheers?  Was he on Cheers?  George?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  He's not.  I think he was.  I never watched Cheers.  You never watched Cheers either?  I've seen moments of it.  No, I didn't.  Of course George Wendt was on Cheers.  I was teasing.  That's just my good acting.  I know who he was.  Fucking Mars is mumbling Norm in the back.  I know, Mars.  I'm kidding.  I've got to be honest.  I wasn't sure.  Yeah, yeah, no.  Okay.  That was some good acting.  Yeah, you know how it is.  So we're going to talk to Norm.  What are we going to do when he walks in and go, Norm?  Hey, hey.  He'll probably sit down and go, well, you know, it was a great experience.  Drinking with George, the name of his book. 
[00:28:30]  But I know what you're saying is that it would be nice to have them as well.  I know what you're saying.  Well, yeah, it would be a nice combo.  I mean, STP has a new album out.  All right, so that's kind of a newer guest that's still doing it.  And George Wendt has nothing else going on, so he's writing a book.  Tomorrow we have Slash, who's not a twat.  Slash has been great.  Slash rules.  Slash is one of the coolest musicians I think I've ever met in my entire life.  Remember he hung out and just played Guitar Hero with us? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, he was totally cool.  He's like, I have nothing to do.  I'll play some fucking Guitar Hero right now.  Had no problem, you know, making small talk and making sure that, you know,  that, you know, you had your Slash time or whatever you want to call it.  Like, a lot of these guys, they just don't give a fuck.  They would just be like, hey, what's up, and just leave you alone.  And he was totally, totally cool.  Yeah, I've been talking to Slash for, I don't even know at this point, 15 years easily.  Easily.  And that guy's been on top of the world for 24 years already, whenever Appetite came out. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, you'd think the guy would get jaded or just not care anymore.  Right.  No, he's always been cool.  He's right there.  Always been fucking cool.  I've never had a bad experience with Slash ever.  Well, he dealt with...  And he's always given us his time.  He empathizes probably with people who have to deal with those fucking babies,  because he dealt with a way bigger fucking Axl.  Look at a guy who's great, but it's like, ugh, ugh.  Oh, fuck Axl.  Well, he dealt with Axl, and then he dealt with Scott in Bella Revolta.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll talk about Scott Weiland with Slash tomorrow. 
[00:30:00]  We'll get some nice stories out of him.  That's right.  But Slash is too nice of a guy.  He's not going to go down that road, probably.  Imagine those guys back-to-back.  What a nightmare.  One fucking guy who cares only about himself, then another one.  And I was a huge Guns N' Roses fan.  Huge.  I remember getting that first album way before radio was playing it,  going, holy shit, is this going to set the world on fire?  You know, because when you're working radio,  you get to see some of these bands before it goes mass appeal.  What do you think Chinese democracy?  Huh?  Chinese democracy.  I haven't even checked it out. 
[00:30:30]  Yee-hee.  You know, being a huge Guns N' Roses fan from back in the day,  you think I would at least check it out to see?  I don't care.  He waited way too fucking long to put that piece of shit out.  But then he blew off, like, most U.S. promotion, I think.  Oh, good for him.  Like, his little tantrum.  Yeah.  Throwing a little tantrum.  Good.  Go to Europe and promote it.  Good.  Is that what he did?  I think so, yeah.  I could be just talking out of my ass.  Maybe somebody knows.  But I heard he blew off all U.S. promotion.  It's like...  He barely promoted that album.  Yeah, exactly.  He showed.  He did a very long, he did a long billboard interview, 
[00:31:00]  and then I think he did one more interview, and that was it.  What do you consider a long billboard interview?  Uh, it was probably...  It took me about a half hour to read, and I'm a pretty fast reader.  I can't, like...  I can't remember how long it was, but...  It was a very lengthy interview, and that was about all he did.  Well, it's a lovely picture of Slash and Ozzy having tea.  Ozzy looks much more refined than Slash, though.  Ozzy at least has striped socks in his photo and some gentleman's shoes.  Slash has on sneakers and his fucking hat. 
[00:31:30]  Slash looks more like a rock star in that photo.  Slash is all right in my book, and his fucking...  His book was great.  What was the name of that?  I read that thing in two days.  It was just Slash.  It was just called Slash?  That was a great book.  It was a great rock book.  Did you read Slash's book?  No, I haven't.  It's well worth it, man.  Well worth it.  Yeah, it's just called Slash.  That's...  Okay.  Uh...  I would suggest you check that out.  It's amazing how many of these guys come out with books, though, right?  Like, fucking...  Now if Ozzy finally had one, Slash had one...  That was Ozzy's book.  Honestly, I know I'm a jaded fan. 
[00:32:00]  I fucking loved it.  I read it in three days.  That was one of the books I could not stop reading.  You just wanted to see if he mentioned you?  No, I just looked at the back through the bibliography at the end.  Were you secretly hoping?  No, unless it was a...  There's got to be another Jim Norton, because they did do a song many years ago called A Song  for Jim.  Oh, yeah?  Nothing to do with me, of course.  It was 1968.  It's funny how I had to say, nothing to do with me, of course, like somebody might...  I wasn't even going to ask that.  It didn't even cross my mind.  But honestly, it's the best rock biographer I've ever read. 
[00:32:30]  It's completely honest.  He talks a lot about drugs, about abusing his ex-wife.  I mean, really fucking great, man.  My favorite was...  God, I mean, Hammer of the Gods.  Motley Crue was good, too.  Yeah, I was going to say that I think I would have to go Motley Crue and Slash was right  up there, right next to Motley Crue.  I should read his.  Kiss and Makeup was good, Gene's book, but it was more just a cool history of the band  for a Kiss fan.  I like the ones that reveal the really fucking ugly, which... 
[00:33:00]  Ace Frehley's writing his memoirs.  Who wouldn't love to?  I would fucking...  I just want to read it as he's writing it.  It came out over the weekend.  It's already out.  No, no, no.  No, he means it came out.  The news came out, not the book.  Right.  And Steven Tyler's is coming out at the end of the year, I think, which I'm really interested  in reading, because they were all sorts of messes back then.  I think he might have a...  He was living in the building, actually, for a little while, and then just wasn't around  anymore.  Just disappeared?  Apparently had to go somewhere.  Oh, really?  Is that the rumor? 
[00:33:30]  Don't know, yeah.  I never saw him in the neighborhood.  I heard he was living in the building.  Everyone said he was a nice guy, too.  They said he was very friendly.  Right.  Oh, he's the greatest.  When we did time in Boston, he came by a few times.  He was the greatest.  That whole band was awesome.  They were always really, really nice, down-to-earth guys, and remembered us, which was crazy.  Because then we would see him at a show, like, hey, I hope you're there today.  Hey, you know, doing his zooty bops.  His what?  His whatever, what he does.  What's he do? 
[00:34:00]  I don't know.  He does a lot.  He does some zooty bops.  What are those?  What are zooty bops?  What are they?  I don't know.  I made it up on the spot.  Oh, all right.  That's more acceptable than he did it.  No, he does.  You know, he does some catcalls or whatever you want to fucking call them.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony!  Hey, Opie.  I had a kid 10 months ago, and that was the best week of my life, the week between, you  know, after he was born.  So, congratulations, buddy.  Hey, man.  Thank you.  It's a life changer. 
[00:34:30]  It's unbelievable.  I like it, though.  Yeah, nothing like it.  Hey, you know, I think everybody's got a story.  And I would be more interested in George Wentz than I would be in Douchebags from STP, because  you know what?  You're only really interested in the train wreck, and it's always the same story.  So, hey, maybe George has got something interesting to talk about other than just his warm days.  So, who knows?  Yeah, we'll try to get into it with George today.  The thing that's interesting to me about Stone Temple Pilots is that they're obviously 
[00:35:00]  a huge band.  I mean, but as far as, if I had to be very honest and say, okay, guys that I love, they  mean absolutely nothing to me.  And again, not because they think they suck, I just, I'm not aware of any of their songs.  Well, most of them will let you down.  You realize they're just jerks.  Some.  I've had some luck, though, man.  Most of them have been, the guys I love.  Yeah?  Have all been cool to you?  Well, me and Gene had a weird one, but aside from that, now it's nice.  Mm-hmm.  I know Ant doesn't care for him.  I don't like him either. 
[00:35:30]  He's, yeah, whatever.  He's whatever.  I actually like doing radio with him, though.  Yes.  Because I like doing radio with people I don't like, too, because it's kind of fun.  And he definitely gets a reaction.  The time he reached over and grabbed Danny's hand, because Danny was typing too loud while  he was talking, God forbid that Danny does his job while Gene's in studio, he couldn't  handle the loud typing, and actually grabbed his hand.  Do you remember in N.E.W., the first time I met him, I was so starstruck I couldn't talk. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And I was sitting next to him, and my chair was creaking, which would just happen in a  radio studio, and he kind of was like, your chair is creaking.  I was like, rough.  That's probably his OCD.  I wonder if it is, too.  Because it's just too weird that he can't handle that.  But, all right, why don't we say hi to David in Pennsylvania.  David.  Yeah.  Good morning, David.  Good morning.  I was at that STP show, and it was seconds away from a riot.  Oh, yeah, it was.  I mean, it was midnight when they went on.  Yeah.  Midnight.  And you guys were like, at about 10 o'clock, you were like, hey, here's STP. 
[00:36:30]  And we're like, all right, all right, yeah.  Oh, you know what?  I forgot that we did the stage announcement.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  Did you?  You forgot you announced them?  Yeah, I don't know.  I've done hundreds of those.  But, yeah, me and Ant went out on stage, and they said, okay, you don't even have to say  coming up.  Just say, you know, here's STP, and they're going to take about five minutes just to let  the crowd build with, you know, excitement or whatever. 
[00:37:00]  So, that's what we did.  We did just that or something similar to that.  And I believe it was close to two hours later.  Yeah.  Almost two hours, and we were at the exit.  We were afraid for our lives.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he finally came out.  He was, I bet you he was oblivious that he was making everyone wait two hours.  I guess because it was, it's worth it for everybody out there, you know, fucking on the lawn, and  you know, it was worth it to them to wait two hours for his greatness.  To top it off, to top it off, they stunk. 
[00:37:30]  I was so upset.  It was the first time I've ever seen them.  I've seen them, like I said, at least ten times, and that was easily the worst they ever sounded.  Not even, not even close.  No doubt, no doubt in my mind.  What's their biggest song?  I know I know it.  I just can't pick my name, pick a name.  Fuck, I just put the whole, huh?  Plush is up there.  Yeah, it's got to be Plush, Interstate Love Song, Sour Girl.  Sour Girl was a little, yeah.  Yeah.  Sure I've heard them.  Vaseline, I mean, you put up their- 
[00:38:00]  Wicked Garden is a bunch.  Wicked Garden, there you go.  Yeah.  Sex Type Thing, that was like their first singles.  Yeah.  It's amazing how-  There's a million, they have a million songs, you know.  Yeah, I'm very ignorant of any type of like, are they grunge or alternative?  Ah, they started out in that whole grunge alt.  Like, I can name maybe two Pearl Jams.  I can't, that whole, that whole genre of music, I can't really name any music from it.  You don't like it?  I don't know that I don't like it, I just, I mean, no, not really.  Yeah.  All right, hey, thank you, Charlie.  Thanks for the congrats. 
[00:38:30]  I heard that.  So whatever, it's just annoying that a band is going to be here.  We know our audience is larger, and it's not to knock all nation, but the audience of  this show is a lot bigger, and it just makes, what dummies publicists are.  By the way, I just got an email from someone that we love, someone who knows how to book  a radio show, who did a great job booking this particular radio show, Roland.  Here are the people that are in town this week alone.  Russell Brand, who's done our show at least two or three times. 
[00:39:00]  Are we having Russell Brand in?  Probably not, because our connection to him was Roland.  Jonah Hill.  Are we having Jonah Hill in?  We've had him on before.  Is he coming in this week?  This is what, see, I don't just say that we have a problem with booking the show.  Then I give you proof that we have a problem booking the Opie and Anthony show.  These are guys that have done our show in the past, had a great time.  We consider sort of like friends on a radio level.  Russell Brand, Jonah Hill did our show. 
[00:39:30]  He loved doing our show.  Joel McHale, who used to call our show almost weekly.  He's in town.  Is Joel McHale doing our show this week?  Will Fort, we've never had him on.  Jorge Garcia from Lost.  He's in town?  Yeah.  Yeah.  George Lopez.  Michael Emerson we've had on the show.  Are we having Michael Emerson come by this week?  We'd love to get fucking busy.  All of those names you're rattling off have been requested and have all gotten no response  or a sorry, not available.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  We have a problem booking the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:40:00]  Who do I have to talk to?  I can't talk to these guys because they'd get nothing done.  Is there people upstairs I could talk to?  Who do I talk to?  These are all guys that have done our show in the past.  Probably Ross.  All right.  I'll talk to Ross.  Yeah.  That's what I got to do.  I mean, one, two, three, four of these guys have done our show.  Well, George Lopez has done our show too.  So five of these names that are in front of me have been on our show. 
[00:40:30]  So any of them coming in this week?  No.  We got George.  Actually, I shouldn't say that.  I, we haven't got a final response on Russell Brand yet, but he's been all, he's been on  the request list for months.  And so wait, um, so is, is Garcia, George Garcia doing, uh, what's his name?  Jorge?  Yeah.  Jorge Garcia.  Is he doing any press or is he promoting the last lost?  We are.  They have an exclusive with ABC.  The, uh, the whole lost cast has an exclusive.  So you're going to see them all on Kimmel.  We have Nestor, uh, what's Carbonell calling in at 10 o'clock today. 
[00:41:00]  Okay.  And we may have, uh, the guy who plays, uh, what's his, I don't know the actor's name,  but Desmond calling in on a Friday.  All right.  Desmond's a big one.  That's not, yeah.  That's not, that's not, that's two of the main guys.  That's not confirmed yet, but we may have.  There's a lot of names here that, uh, have done our show and we never had a problem with  actually a lot of thank yous after their interview.  So here, let's start booking our own show.  Could, could you guys, uh, bother Joel McHale on Twitter and say, Hey, Opie is, uh, looking  for you to do the show this week.  We know you're in New York city.  They would love for you to stop in and, and, and say, hi, please. 
[00:41:30]  We'll get Joel McHale booked.  This stuff is easy.  And why would they hire Roland Roland's unemployed and, and, and they have a position open here.  What are you doing?  Make us happy for once.  Hire Roland.  Uh, but George went, is coming in.  Watch him be like, watch him be the fucking, I don't know much about the guy.  I'm going to say it would be ironic. 
[00:42:00]  We think he's probably gonna be like a really nice guy.  Watch him just be a complete twat who's trashing everybody.  That would be good.  It'd be great.  That would be wonderful.  You do know the Jade Vixen store.  Were you here for, oh, and Opie wasn't here for Jade Vixen.  I read your emails in between, you know, waking up and stuff.  What happened?  Like she was in, who is she by the way?  Penthouse?  She's in Penthouse.  She's a very cool girl.  And we had her in one of the days I was here.  And I knew I knew her name from somewhere.  I knew I knew the name Jade Vixen.  I know that name, but I'm thinking, no, Anthony took out Taylor Vixen from Penthouse. 
[00:42:30]  So you're mixing up the Vixens.  Like, okay, that's where I know it from.  She's in, she's an Asian girl.  I'm like, I'm fucking, and I had to leave for a flight.  It was driving me nuts.  As I'm going to the airport, I remembered, oh, I remember where I know her from.  She was a dominatrix, I believe, at the Nutcracker.  We were talking about domination stuff.  What's a Nutcracker?  Nutcracker Suite was like a dungeon here in New York.  Okay.  It's closed now.  She did golden. 
[00:43:00]  I kind of wanted her to piss on me at one point.  I love how you say that just casually.  Honestly, it's not even, I guess it is weird, but for me, it's, I really did.  It was like, for years, I was like, I'm going to go see Jade Vixen and get a golden shower.  I never did.  I think I'm jaded, too, because I hear you just say that.  I'm like, oh, yeah, okay, that's normal.  Well, I'm annoyed at myself because I knew I knew her.  Right.  And she's sitting here talking, very cool, I believe.  And then as I'm getting to the airport, I'm like, no, no, that's not her.  And then, yep, it was her. 
[00:43:30]  She was a dom in New York, and she was seeing a guy, and one of her slaves, her, you know,  regular slaves, I guess was stalking her, shot and killed her boyfriend.  Who?  Her boyfriend?  Jade's boyfriend?  Yes.  Kidnapped her, like, took her for a ride, was going to kill her.  She talked her way out of the car, and she talked her way out of it, and then he shot  himself when the police came.  So it was a murder-suicide.  Wow.  So what did she have to say about this? 
[00:44:00]  Jimmy's biting his own teeth.  I'm nothing.  That's pretty amazing.  I've never seen anyone bite their own teeth before.  What I would like is this.  Can I have the prep sheet from that day?  I know we have it.  All right, yeah.  Thank you.  I know people are going to say, but Ope, it's impossible to bite your own teeth.  No, it's not.  If you're looking at Jimmy right now, how do you bite your own teeth?  This is one, I really, I sent off a very unpleasant email.  This is one of the ones that really, beyond, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  But I was mad at myself, too, because I'm like, I knew I knew the name, but I knew why  I didn't pursue it in my own head any further, because I knew the mistake I made was confusing  her with Taylor Vixen.  I was like, oh, no, you're just thinking of the chick you ain't going out with.  Right.  And I didn't connect a penthouse girl to a dom.  But it's annoying me that, like, you know, her name is nagging you.  Like, I fucking, I know this person.  Well, that would have been some great radio to get into that.  Yeah, even if she wouldn't have talked about it, I found out after she wouldn't have,  because of pending litigation.  But there was still a way to bring it up and bring it to the table. 
[00:45:00]  Mm-hmm.  However, we had, me and I had to just ask for some chicks.  We'll get some chicks here.  I've been at chicks in a while.  So Steve comes back and says, well, this is one of the people I got is Jade Vixen coming  and promoting penthouse.  And, um, fine.  So we booked her and he got her in.  And we had the prep sheet.  And, uh, I'll read the prep sheet to the audience.  Not that it's interesting to you at home, but just, you see.  Well, just, it's interesting knowing that, you know, that should have been on the prep sheet.  Yeah, murder-suicide, you might want to put on the fucking prep sheet. 
[00:45:30]  Kidnapping, murder-suicide, you might want to.  Well, you know, murder-suicide is so, so every day.  Yeah, it's old hat at this point.  It's really old hat.  I mean, how many, how many freaking guests are we going to have in to talk about their  murder-suicide fucking thing?  I was on the phone.  I called Ant from the plane because he had just come off the air.  And, you know, I was like, you know, we had this girl in today.  And I was, livid, I was on the plane making a scene.  I was so, so angry. 
[00:46:00]  I was afraid I was going to have an incident on the aircraft.  But not with the people around me, but yelling into the phone.  How great would it be if they turned the plane around because you're losing your mind over  the fact that we didn't have correct info on her.  On a girl, I know, on a girl who was going to pee on me.  Cool, thank you, young Sam.  But, Sam, you usually do the, uh, the one sheet.  So, uh, are you to blame here?  Because I know you do a fine one sheet.  No, I do not do the one sheets for the porno stars.  Why not?  Because another staffer has all the porno connections.  He does it from the beginning. 
[00:46:30]  Every time a porno girl has come in, that's Steve C's gig.  Jade Vickson in studio at 9 a.m.  This is not, no, this is.  This, this, this one sheet sucks.  No, this is pretty good.  I actually didn't do that one.  What?  I didn't do it, and it's my fault.  This is this one.  I had an intern do it.  Oh, that's good.  That's smart.  Okay, so an intern did our guest.  We have 20 people that work for the show behind the scenes, but make sure the intern does the one sheet.  Well, hold on.  There is some information on here, and there's one thing I did miss, which I'm a little annoyed at myself for.  Like, she said she goes to fetish parties. 
[00:47:00]  I should have made that connection, but again, but I'm battling.  Appeared in the March 2010, appeared in the March 2010 issue of Penthouse.  That was the big headline.  Is a lifestyle fetishist model from lingerie and nylons to latex, catsuits, and hood.  That's bullet point one for discussion.  Bullet point two for discussion.  Was approached to begin, and the begin is in capital B, because I guess that's how you read begin.  Was approached to begin. 
[00:47:30]  Training as a professional dominatrix at 18, and specialized in boot worship, psychological domination, tickle torture, and corporal punishment.  Was originally enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania in pursuit of a Ph.D. in engineering.  All right, so that one, I guess, you'd go, so what happened?  You were in college, and you were going to get a Ph.D. in engineering.  What happened?  Yeah, you know, I was in college for a little while.  I wanted to get my Ph.D. in engineering, but it didn't happen.  All right, there's that.  And then, of course, penthousemagazine.com and jadevixen.com. 
[00:48:00]  Well, there's a lot of space on this sheet to add the murder-suicide storyline.  Look at this.  There's a lot of empty space here.  A lot of room for a murder-suicide.  They even used a big font just to take up room on the paper to promote penthousemagazine.com and jadevixen.com.  And even with the big font, there's still a lot of extra room on this.  A lot of room.  To add, oh, by the way, murder-suicide.  You might want to ask her about it. 
[00:48:30]  Not sure if she's going to talk about it, but you might want to at least ask her.  Because at least you could put the information out there so the audience knows that the woman they're hearing has been through this.  It was an amazing story.  It ended 2008, and I remember it happening because I'm a perv, so I follow the domination scene.  So what intern did the...  It was Charlie that day.  It was Charlie who's no longer with us.  Yeah, but Charlie should have never done this.  You're right.  We have way too many people working for the show behind the scenes.  I mean, you've got to get someone else to do this.  It was a complete fucking error on my part to ask an intern to do it. 
[00:49:00]  Honestly, dude, and I mean it's the worst miss I've seen in my professional life.  Are you sure about that?  Yeah.  Murder-suicide?  Murder?  You're forgetting.  It's MSK.  It's murder-suicide kidnapping.  Kidnapping.  Yeah.  A murder-suicide...  Kidnapping.  Kidnapping.  And...  Was a BA major in engineering. 
[00:49:30]  Pursuit of a PhD in engineering.  Yeah.  How tough was the class schedule?  So were you living on campus?  Yeah.  Well, no, um, I was going to live on campus, but I decided it was relatively...  Oh, interesting.  How many miles were you driving to get to school?  Well, it was about 30 miles each way, which made me very tired.  Did you pledge a sorority?  Did you have enough time to do that?  Well, no.  I was a little bit busy with schoolwork. 
[00:50:00]  I was bogged down.  Do you see what I mean?  There's not a lot of fodder for conversation.  Almost a PhD in engineering.  Almost means nothing.  Yeah.  Every single time.  Almost means nothing.  That was a bad one.  All right.  I got to eat now.  Anybody coming in today?  Not a call back, but I did get a text from Jackie, who said he's in Cannes and wants to 
[00:50:30]  call in and talk about how big his penis is.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Jackie the Joke Man?  Want to talk to him?  He's in France?  Uh-huh.  God damn, life's good for Jackie the Joke Man.  Fucking, uh, and he...  Ah, whatever.  I was going to say he showed up at my brother's restaurant and had a good time, but I think I  already told the people that.  Why don't we take a break and, uh, and continue?  Uh, very excited.  George Wendt coming by today.  He is.  And he's promoting...  I'll tell you...  I'll tell you what he's promoting.  Um, he's promoting the Borgata July 2nd and 3rd and Caroline's in June. 
[00:51:00]  Is Steve bummed that I just did that?  Why?  No.  Not at all.  Because we're going to get more fucking 1980s sitcom stars.  And then the next time we go to book George Wendt, there'll be like a whole rant about  how he's a dick and he doesn't come in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's George Wendt?  I'm sure he'll be good.  Is he cheers?  He's...  Yeah.  Cheers ended 20 years ago.  It's a pretty big show, though.  I bet you if you walk down the street, he's not getting a lot of norms these days. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe not.  It's not his fault that STP are cunts.  I think I am taking it out.  We don't want to vote.  Yeah, but it's not...  I think I am taking it out.  He's a guy...  Look, you know what, though?  Because of this STP situation.  He's in one of the biggest shows ever.  You know, and again, if he's...  I like George Wendt, but I'm sure the book's going to be terrific, and I'm sure we're going  to have a good time with George Wendt, so I think Jimmy's right.  I'm taking it out on him because of the STP situation.  We don't want to blow the Cliff Clavin booking.  What is he up to?  What do you think he's up to? 
[00:52:00]  Pixar movies.  Oh, yeah.  He does, like, voiceover.  He does, like, every Pixar movie that comes out.  He's in at least one voiceover.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  He's got a great career in Hollywood.  It's cool.  And I'm trying to figure out who I'm doing the radio show with today.  You're right.  So he does Pixar.  Kenny.  Voices.  Troy Kwan wanted to sit in in Anthony's place.  What?  Yeah, he's got a lot of STP knowledge.  He loves current events. 
[00:52:30]  I like Troy Kwan.  He's a bright guy.  Kenny and Troy were talking about the possibility of Troy taking Anthony's spot today.  I don't know exactly.  He just blew out his knee running down the hall.  What the?  See, he's very angry.  He's a go-getter.  Come on in, Troy.  Good choice.  Did you just blow out your knee?  He's got a stress fracture in his heel.  A lot of people don't know that.  No, take Anthony's seat.  No, you're not taking Anthony's seat.  Talk over there.  Don't use his mic.  I try. 
[00:53:00]  He comes over and he's like, you can use his mic.  He goes, go in the studio.  They want you in there.  And I'm like, what?  He's like, yeah, you got to fill in for Anthony today.  So, do you have anything to add?  No.  Yes, you do.  He said no.  Murder, suicide, kidnapping.  And we missed it.  You have nothing?  Troy, don't embarrass me.  I need people to step up today.  Yeah.  Troy, you got to step up.  Troy, tell me that thing about Scott Weiland you were saying.  No, how about this?  After the break, you come up with something. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, a Troy's show topic.  Huh?  A show topic from Troy.  Not a show topic.  Because I'm not taking phone calls because he has a show topic.  I'm not doing show topic shit.  Oh.  After the break, Troy is going to step up and give us something where the listeners go,  holy shit, there's Troy Quang.  You got any story, anything.  Anything.  He's got it.  You got it?  Yeah.  Go work on it because we're doing it right after the break.  Sounds good.  You got something? 
[00:54:00]  No.  Not yet.  I will.  No, he does.  All right.  We'll talk to Troy Quang next.  We're going to eat some food.  George Wendt coming in today.  And who knows?  Maybe other people stopping by.  See, if I say that, then maybe the people will stay tuned.  We know who isn't stopping by, though.  Who?  Stone Temple Pilots.  Oh, well.  Good for them.  With STP!

[00:56:30]  Thank you, and goodbye.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  We got radio to do.  Good news.  We just got the George Wendt one sheet.  It's called the one sheet in the biz.  He's coming in to promote Drinking with George by George Wendt. 
[00:57:00]  Drinking with George, Jim Norton, is George Wendt's book about his love affair with beer.  He chronicles.  Who did the one sheet?  I did.  Huh?  I did.  It's cool.  You spelled chronicles wrong.  Yeah, that's a weird spelling of chronicles.  Chronicles.  C-R-O-N.  Chronicles.  It's a European spelling.  That's a European spelling?  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  Yep.  Oh, okay.  He chronicles everything he loves about it and all the ways beer has affected his life. 
[00:57:30]  The book is half autobiography and half a book about everything having to do with beer.  Yeah.  He said he can't pick a favorite beer.  He started drinking it as a kid when he would get his grandpa beers.  And get a sip for going to get them.  He not only tells personally stories. 
[00:58:00]  Personally stories?  It's a typo.  Typo.  He not only tells personally stories, but also gets into bar etiquette and theory, as well  as ways to drink beer.  We just got the book.  When did we get these?  He says that a fire extinguisher can be used to get a six-pack cold. 
[00:58:30]  You all right?  I'm reading the one sheet, Jim.  Are you okay?  When did we get these books in?  I was handed one for the one sheet yesterday morning when I got in.  So maybe they just arrived.  No, they came.  When would they come, Iraq?  I think, like, Friday afternoon or something like that.  Why would nobody tell us that we have the books of the author that we're supposed to interview?  Steve just handed them to me to bring it to the studio.  Can Steve come here, please?  Can somebody ask why we have an interview?  I don't want to bitch.  We have an interview to do.  How about the fucking book of the guy we're interviewing? 
[00:59:00]  Holy shit!  Wow.  And why is it a soft?  That might just be the way he released it.  Probably smarter to do.  No, this is the paperback.  Is the hardcover already out?  I believe.  Okay, maybe.  This is paperback launch.  We're interviewing him on the paperback version of fucking drinking with George?  That's correct.  Holy shit!  I got him yesterday morning, Jerry.  Okay.  How come you didn't tell us the book was released?  When was the actual book released? 
[00:59:30]  I think I watched a Today Show interview with him pitching it from, like, a little less  than a year ago, June 2009.  We actually had him booked when the book initially was released, and then we didn't do a show.  Okay.  It was probably last summer.  Yeah.  So how come we didn't get these yesterday?  I handed one to Sam to do the one sheet, and then I held the other two to give you guys  today because I thought you would, you know, in the past.  I'm not sure if you guys ever read these things. 
[01:00:00]  Books?  No, not books in general.  Do you usually read the books when I hand these things to you, Jim?  Steve, where have you been?  I'm serious.  It doesn't matter.  It's very obvious that Jimmy brings the books home and peruses them, which is a fine word  when you're talking about books.  Even if I don't...  He peruses them.  Even if I don't read the book, the fact that I would have it and want to go through it...  Yeah, he'll go through it a little bit.  Sometimes I don't, but there are times I absolutely do.  Okay.  Then I will make sure that you get it.  As soon as I get a copy of the book, you'll get it. 
[01:00:30]  I was under the impression that you didn't want these things because you weren't looking  at them.  We have to interview them.  I know you have to look at them.  I know you have to interview them.  That's why you've got a one sheet.  Beer 101, Beer Styles.  When I was a kid, it seemed like there was only two kinds of beers in America, domestics  and imports.  The domestics were the yellow beers like Budweiser, Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Miller Highlight.  It's not his fault.  We should have had these books in advance.  Imports were exotic beers from foreign countries like Heineken, the Moosehead. 
[01:01:00]  Real men drank domestics.  Beer snobs drank imports.  What was that?  I don't know.  The bottom line is, if we got a fucking author to interview, George went, I should have at  least had the books so we could look through them.  There's nothing worse.  I'm interviewed by a lot of different people on the road.  There's nothing worse than when you walk into a room to do an interview and they give  you some shitty Wikipedia fucking question.  A hundred ways to say that you're drunk. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, look, he's getting praise from fucking Stephen Colbert and some other people.  I'm not going to shit on you.  Annihilated, bashed, befuddled, bent, bibulous, blasted, blithering, blitzed, blotto, boloxed,  bombed, boozed up, butt-wasted, buzzed.  And that's only the bees.  Zazzled.  It ends with zazzled.  Reeling, ripped, rocked, ruined, on a bender, on fire, stewed, stinko, stoned, stupid, tanked, 
[01:02:00]  intoxicated, jacked, juiced, lit, loaded, looped.  George went coming in today in about an hour.  Half hour?  He's here?  What?  He's coming through the door?  Schedule for a half hour.  Huh?  All right.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, sir?  I guess you're producing the show today.  So you got Troy Kwan to help out the show today? 
[01:02:30]  Let me tell you, he's going to take the show to a whole new level.  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Just tear it to you.  Yeah, man, but, you know, they, we got, we got guys running the channel.  We're in good shape.  They know what's going on.  But it ain't George Wendt's fault.  I mean, it's like, it's like, it's like this whole thing is not his fault.  He's the guy who wrote a book.  The fact that Stone Temple Pilots is not here is because the band are cunts.  Yeah.  And the fact that we don't have fucking research done properly is because things are not being 
[01:03:00]  done behind the fucking scenes.  Mm-hmm.  Troy Kwan will bring a smile to your face.  Yeah?  Yes.  So what did we request from Troy Kwan today?  Well, you know, a lot of people are going to be interested in this segment because it's  Tattoo Talk with Troy.  You even named his segment?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got a lot of tattoos.  He's a very interesting chap.  Why is he shaking his head? 
[01:03:30]  Because I'm sitting down to do my work and this is what, Kenny's like, oh, they want  you in studio and this is what your segment's going to be.  You know what, Kenny?  You're producing the rest of the show today.  I like, I like Tattoo Talk with Troy Kwan.  You've come up with something for the next break, Kenny.  All right?  No problem.  I got good questions for George Wendt when he gets here.  Yeah?  What's one of the questions?  I'm just going to compliment on how I loved him in Seinfeld.  He was in Seinfeld?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was Jerry's friend.  He does those Weight Watchers commercials. 
[01:04:00]  He was in Shallow Hal.  Oh.  That's Jason Alexander.  It's the same guy.  Why is it the same guy?  You know, chubby, lovable fella.  You know, he just takes the wig off to play Jason.  Did we lose you, Jimmy?  I'm just irritated.  Fucking, look, I don't love or hate George Wendt.  It's not the point.  No, I like.  The guy contributed.  He did a fight.  He's one of the biggest shows ever done.  At least he did something.  We're just doing comedy.  I have nothing against George Wendt.  I don't either.  And I'm sure the book did well.  I'm just having fun with the whole situation. 
[01:04:30]  I honestly don't love George Wendt.  I hope he realizes that I'm not, you know, personally trashing him.  I'm just having a little fun and making some radio today.  That's all.  I don't.  Or at least trying.  I don't love George Wendt.  Like, I'm a huge fan.  Like, I respect the guy.  Whatever.  The stuff that's happening is way beyond him coming in.  It's just annoying.  Yeah, but we got guys running the channel.  They're on top of everything.  Don't worry about it.  But, I mean, it's.  They're going to take care of everything.  Or so they said a year and a half ago.  Kenny.  Yeah, keeping the show rolling. 
[01:05:00]  You know, upbeat, fun.  But if you're producing a show, don't you think you should have some intro music for the Troy Kwan tattoo segment?  Travis, what do you got?  No, you can't just say, Travis, what do you got?  What do you want, Kenny?  You're producing.  Yeah, although Travis could come up with something on the spot.  Yeah, give me a little something something.  No, you have to suggest something that would work with the Troy Kwan segment.  Well, Troy also has a show on liquid metal here on Sirius XM.  Yeah.  So, give me something liquid. 
[01:05:30]  How about.  Travis, you want to take care of this?  How about I don't listen to liquid metal, so I don't know what the hell's playing on that channel.  Something with the word liquid in it, not metal.  Oh, you need something to add.  Troy, what do you want as a theme song?  Oh, yeah, okay.  See, that's good, Kenny.  Pig Destroyer, Piss Angel.  You want to come into that?  What's the band and what's the song?  Pig Destroyer, Piss Angel.  Yeah, I know.  Which one is the song name and which one is the band name? 
[01:06:00]  Google it, Google it.  The band's name is Pig Destroyer.  Pig Destroyer?  Yes.  And the song?  Piss Angel.  Troy's got a lot of good piss stories, too, as a backup.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, Troy's a rock and roller before he was my personal producer.  I think we lost Jimmy.  I'm free to say.  No, it's all right.  Jimmy's there.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  Really?  You're not the only one.  Now, go outside the door.  Kenny's going to intro you over your music. 
[01:06:30]  All right?  Travis, whenever you're ready.  Oh, great.  Wake up, everybody.  For the first time on the Opie and Anthony Show, it's Tattoo Talk with Troy. 
[01:07:00]  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Troy.  Jim just looks pissed.  I'm fine.  So, Troy, you've got a lot of tattoos.  Kenny just moved over to Anthony's mic.  You going to help with the segment?  We're not talking about his tattoos.  He's got a story for us.  Do I?  Do the story.  Well, it's Tattoo Talk with Troy Kwan.  Yeah, but we break the ice with the tattoos because a lot of people got tattoos in this world. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  So, they're very interesting.  It's compelling.  All right.  Ask him a tattoo question.  So, Troy, what's the significance of the flames?  I worked in a tattoo shop for 10 years, so I just...  How'd you get tattoos?  Worked with a couple different artists and got some different tattoos.  Are there any you regret?  Most of them.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why?  Well, I started working there when I was 18, so we just started doing weird tattoos, 
[01:08:00]  and they would...  I have, like, a one-eyed baby with antlers hanging from hooks on my arm, and...  Oh, can I see that one?  I have to take off my shirt.  Okay.  Yeah, baby!  Now we're talking!  So, most of them are, uh...  So, you regret most of your tattoos because you're tatted up.  Yeah, well...  You've got a lot of tats.  I wish they were better looking.  Sorry, I've got to take off my whole shirt here.  Look, he's V-shaping in the stomach, too, ladies.  With Calvin Klein underwear.  What does it look like, Jimmy?  It's a one-eyed baby on a hook? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  It's just an odd baby.  You can see the hooks are through his hands.  Yeah.  And the baby's got a one-eyed, like a cyclops, and he's got, like, weird little ram horns  coming off his head, and his hands are hooked through the back of them.  Yeah.  So Troy's hanging a baby off his arm.  People are...  That's the original.  By the way, we woke up a shitload of people with your entrance music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People pissed.  Yeah, that's why it should be on a morning show.  Blue Heeler writes, I'm guessing there's no way to play Pig Destroyer to the hook. 
[01:09:00]  No, there's no hook.  And give a little traffic and weather before the vocals kick in.  No.  All right.  So you have tattoos that you regret.  What else, Kenny?  Yeah, one of my favorites is the DeLorean symbol he's got on the back of his neck.  Turn around.  Yeah, why would you have that?  I had a DeLorean.  I had a fully...  Yeah, I got a Jeep.  I don't have the back of my neck.  Well, I just like the car.  I like the story behind John DeLorean.  And...  Yeah, he was a Coke dealer.  Well, he was never convicted of Coke, but... 
[01:09:30]  Why do you like John DeLorean?  Well, he was the inventor of a lot of the muscle cars in the 60s.  And then he decided to start his own company, and he was coming up with this idea of the next level sports car, and it didn't work out, unfortunately.  And the car, it was a cool idea, but it never really took off, unfortunately.  Right.  So what were the cocaine allegations?  The company was going under, and he was doing whatever he could to save the company, and he was going to psychics and whatnot, and he supposedly was importing cocaine into the United States. 
[01:10:00]  In the car, supposedly, but he was never convicted.  But did that ruin him?  Pretty much, yeah.  Sure did.  It was a misunderstanding.  Okay, good.  What was the importing that was white?  What was the importing that was white?  Salt.  Yeah, what were they mistaking for cocaine?  I don't know. 
[01:10:30]  I believe it was actually cocaine, but somehow he got away with it.  Oh.  And he was set up, probably.  Yeah.  Right, Troy?  That's what he says.  One tattoo that frightens me is that hyena on your forearm.  Why does it frighten you, Kenny?  Well, it's ferocious.  It's actually a mandrill monkey.  It's not a hyena, but.  What is it?  It's a mandrill monkey wearing a bondage mask.  On his forearm.  Has anybody ever guessed that right?  No.  No.  It's a good piece of work, though.  Oh, thanks. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, I mean, the artwork's good.  Yeah.  It's cool.  And I have a fly head over here.  Yeah.  Why does that tattoo scare you, though, Kenny?  No, do you look?  It's ferocious.  He's got his mouth open.  He's going like, ah.  This is a great segment, Kenny, by the way.  It sure is, Troy.  Thank you.  Well, Kenny's producing the show today.  Troy.  Yeah.  So are we ready for Troy's story?  Well, all we did was we said, before the break, come up with something that the people  out there would find interesting. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, because ladies.  Some crazy story, something that, I don't know.  Something.  Troy's single now, too, ladies.  So you could Twitter him at TroyKwan.com.  That's not a lot.  Nah.  Or you could Facebook him.  All right.  Troy, what do you got?  So, I mean, do you want to talk about tattoo stories?  I mean, I have a lot of tattoo stories from working in a tattoo shop for dinner.  No, your job was to come up with one thing that would keep our audience from going somewhere  else today.  All right.  Well, I've done a lot of Prince Albert piercings. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  And basically what that is, is it goes in through the bottom of the penis and out the urethra.  It's a ring.  Right below the mushroom head?  Right.  Is that where you go in?  Yeah.  Front or back?  On the bottom?  Does it come through the hole?  It comes through the hole.  And what you have to do is...  Anesthetize it with your mouth?  No.  You put Luden's honey-flavored cough drops in your mouth.  You have a receiving tube that's pretty thick. 
[01:12:30]  It's about that thick.  And it goes down your urethra and it has a bevel.  And you bend the bevel to push that skin through and you put a needle right through it and it  comes right out.  And you had to do this?  You had to hold guys' dicks and do this?  Yeah.  How long does it take to actually make the piercing?  A couple seconds.  That's it?  Yeah.  But guys scream and it bleeds like a motherfucker.  Okay.  But it doesn't go through the urethra?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would anyone want that done?  And I'm sure there's a few people out there that have these, but why? 
[01:13:00]  Why would you get that done?  Supposedly it's good for sex.  Why?  Supposedly it enhances, it hits things that your regular penis can't do.  Metal detectors.  Yeah.  And then, you know, of course the shock value.  I mean, you tell a girl that you have your penis pierced, she's going to be interested  in seeing it.  But, uh...  Did you like holding guys' penises?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Imagine they shrunk a little bit when there's a needle coming at them.  Absolutely.  And scream.  I mean, the scream that comes out of people when they pierce their penis.  Yeah.  Did anybody not scream? 
[01:13:30]  I don't think that's good for business, to hear someone screaming behind that door as  you're waiting to go, you know, back and get your tattoo.  Right, but...  Or your piercing.  I mean, it's pretty painful, so it's understandable.  But women usually take it better.  Women, general, piercings usually go a little bit smoother.  Did you get to do those?  Oh, yeah.  Clits?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Any big meaty ones?  Yeah, some pretty gross ones, too.  I mean, girls secreting all over everything, and...  What are they secreting? 
[01:14:00]  Just weird fluid.  Yeast infections?  Yeah.  Um, I've had a...  I was piercing a girl's vagina once, and her husband was over top of me going, do you  like what you see?  Do you like what you see?  And I guess they were swingers, and they were trying to get me involved and bring me home,  which is kind of a bizarre thing.  But, uh, yeah, I've seen some pretty...  Well, did you like what you saw?  Uh, she was an older woman, but yeah, she looked pretty good.  And...  Did he go there? 
[01:14:30]  Nah, that's too weird, man.  Like, fucking some dude's wife while he watches is just a weird thing, man.  I've, uh, I've had my dick sucked one time by a chick.  I met...  There was an ad in the Home News newspaper, and, uh, so I went and met with her.  What's the Home News?  It was my hometown newspaper, whatever, North Boston.  In Brunswick?  Yeah, like a local Jersey paper.  Right, right.  And they used to do singles ads in the back, so she said she put an ad out for a woman  who's looking to meet a guy to fuck.  So I met with her, and she was, uh, you know, she had a husband, but she's like,  I didn't tell you that, because I just wanted straight guys. 
[01:15:00]  I didn't want guys...  So I go over to the house, she said he just wants to watch, and, you know, she's like  45, and he's probably like 50, he looks like a pizza maker, he's got like a weird horseshoe  hairdo.  And then, uh, he just kind of sat there and watched me fool around with his wife, and  then we were 69, and she sucked my dick.  And then he just went down and watched her suck my dick.  It was really creepy.  That's all he did was just watch?  Yeah, he didn't...  He didn't jerk off or anything?  I think we tried to double stuff her, but then I lost my rod, because it was just creepy,  fucking with a pizza maker.  What, did he have his hands behind his back and just kind of, like, leaned in to check 
[01:15:30]  it out?  Yeah.  That is weird.  And then I went with my...  I started dating a girl, and I brought her over, and the older woman ate her pussy.  Which is kind of hot.  Interesting.  That's my whole story.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Kenny, do you like this segment?  Tattoo Talk with Troy?  It's going well.  It's going well?  Yes, yes, yes.  How do we wrap this up?  Troy's just getting started.  I want to hear more Tattoo Talk.  I mean, now we're just getting into cock and pussy piercings.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  I mean, I worked in a shop for 10 years and seen some bizarre shit. 
[01:16:00]  You know, I worked in a little college town, Kutztown, Pennsylvania, so it was just like  horny college girls all the time, you know?  So you got to grab the guy's penis?  To grab his ball bag?  How do you grab a guy's penis?  Well, usually what you do is you take paper towels and you just sort of put a hole in  it and then, say, put your dick through it.  You know, that way, because he's going to bleed a lot, so he doesn't want to get blood  all over his clothing.  Do you have to grab the base of it? 
[01:16:30]  You have to...  And you got to make it a little hard so you got, you know, so it's not flopping as you're  trying to pierce it?  Well, you have to mark where you're going to go.  Right.  And then you sort of have to sort of eyeball it.  I mean, once you do a lot of them...  Did you go to school for this?  No, I did a piercing apprenticeship.  And the next thing you know, you're just putting holes in guys' dicks?  Who does that?  Donald Trump?  All right, Kenny.  Apprentice, I got it.  Jesus.  But, yeah, you just work with a piercer and you supervise a lot of piercings and then  they say, okay, and then they watch you do it. 
[01:17:00]  Who's the first guy...  That's the one I want to know.  Who's the guy who's like, this is my first cock piercing?  And he's like, oh, all right, well, good luck to you.  This is his dick.  I wouldn't say that.  You know what I mean?  I've watched a bunch of Prince Albert's son and I was just like, okay, I'm ready to do  it.  Did you ever see...  Well, I don't even know.  Like, I've seen pictures of guys that have split cocks.  Yeah, I've never done that.  I have a friend who has his tongue split in half.  Right.  And he was going to split his dick.  How do you split a tongue in half?  Well, he had his tongue pierced and then you take, like, fishing line wire and you just 
[01:17:30]  start every day just tightening it a little bit more and a little bit more.  That's how they do that?  And then what they do is they slice it and then they cauterize it.  When do they slice it?  When do they slice it?  Yeah.  After, uh...  About a month and a half or so.  Wait, so you...  I never knew that.  Did you?  So there's a hole in your tongue and then you put fishing line in?  If you want to split your tongue, that's how you do it.  Wait, you have to do it yourself?  I wouldn't do it, no.  But you could go to a place and do it.  I mean, it's illegal in Pennsylvania to do it. 
[01:18:00]  So you'd have to go to a, uh, like an underground place or, you know...  Right.  When the, uh...  But how do you tighten the fishing line?  You just, like, turn it?  You just put a knot in, you just keep pushing it, you unknot it, and then keep tightening  it and keep tightening it.  And it just starts to slit and pull, uh, make the hole bigger.  But doesn't that hurt?  Fuck yeah, it hurts.  Yeah, it hurts really bad.  And then you have to eventually get in to just get it cut?  Then you take a scalpel and you cut it and then you cauterize both sides.  How the fuck that, how, how, what kind of pain is that? 
[01:18:30]  Unbearable.  Unbearable.  Is it good for pussy eating?  You are able to have...  No, you're missing the clit.  Well, you have control over both sides.  The clit goes right in the middle.  If people that have their tongues forked can cross them and move them around, they have  control of both sides.  Right, right, right.  So I would imagine...  You have to go figure eight on the clit.  So I would imagine you would be able to do some pretty crazy shit.  Wait, wait, so they...  Yeah!  So they're sized with a scalpel?  Is that real?  Yeah.  This guy had split his cock all the way down to his balls? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, sometimes people split the head, too, so the head splits like this.  Yeah, I've seen that.  Fucking twins.  Holy shit.  They split the cock.  I've seen the inside of the cock tattooed.  They'll tattoo the inside of the cock and then they'll put barbells or whatever all the  way up the inside.  It's really horrendous.  Yeah.  Some people are into some crazy shit.  So wait, they split the tongue.  The guy will...  After a month, he takes a scalpel and cuts.  Yeah.  Cuts right down the middle of the tongue.  And it bleeds horribly.  Oh, it's awful.  There's blood everywhere.  And how do they cauterize it?  I'm not quite sure how they do it, but they have to... 
[01:19:30]  They use anesthesia or something?  I don't think they do.  What do they do?  This was like a place that was doing it in the basement and they were sort of doing it  like, uh...  What?  On the sneak.  Yeah.  I think it's hard to get licensing to do something like that.  They drink a lot.  They also have a good selection of hangers for the ladies.  So...  What?  What?  What?  I...  Yeah, there you go.  I need your help today. 
[01:20:00]  That was an abortion joke.  Oh, okay.  Jesus.  So what about, uh...  They cut...  How do they stop the tongue from bleeding?  I'm not quite sure how they cauterize it.  I've never seen it done.  I've just seen pictures of it.  Is it with heat?  They cauterize means they solder it.  Right.  They burn it to create, um...  It's like instant scarring to the tongue so it heals like that.  And then there's no way to go back once it's done.  Right.  All right.  I don't comprehend that.  No.  Let me go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  Hey, I had a question for this guy who's piercing the cock. 
[01:20:30]  Does he ever practice on, like, squash or cucumbers before he actually did a real one?  Yeah.  The texture's not the same, sir.  But did you practice?  That's a good question.  Or did you just go in there?  Well, when I...  And the person didn't know that, uh, you know, you're doing this for the first time.  When I first started, I would tell people that, look, I'm a piercing apprentice and I'll  pierce you for just the jewelry cost and I would be under the supervision of the person  that was teaching me at the time.  Right.  Holy shit.  That's unbelievable.  And this guy's saying you're full of shit. 
[01:21:00]  Aaron in New York.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Aaron.  Hey, Aaron.  I don't want to bust your bubble there, Troy, but I did my own PA about 11 years ago.  And, uh, I got an elephant tattooed on my stomach with a full trunk right to the end.  Doesn't hurt that bad.  You got a what tattooed on your stomach?  Oh, an elephant.  Oh.  I have an elephant head tattooed on my stomach with a full trunk.  That's your cock is the trunk?  Oh, yeah.  Well, great.  Some people take pain differently.  I mean, everybody...  I know people that get tattoos and some tattoos hurt and some don't. 
[01:21:30]  I mean, everybody's different.  Yeah, but the PA is all soft tissue and there's no exit on the body piercing because it's gone  out the urethra.  It's really not that bad.  All right.  Well, the people that I pierced were screaming, so I don't know what to tell you, sir.  All right.  We're just about done with Troy, but, uh, Brett in Iowa, you got your tongues, uh, split?  Brett?  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  And that's how they do it with the fishing line and you got to tighten it every day until  they get a nice enough hole or something and then they take a scalpel and split it?  Well, that's not the way we did it on my tongue. 
[01:22:00]  I know of people that have done it that way.  The way we did it on mine, I had four straight piercings in straight line from the tip back  and I gently rose those in size and then we took a scalpel and opened it up.  And as far as the cauterizing goes, they, they, if you get it done in a professional  shop that actually is licensed to do it, they have to do it laser-wise, but you can't,  like Jim said before, you can get it done with basically a hot solder iron and cauterize 
[01:22:30]  the wound that way.  Ah.  I had it basically done professionally, but with a laser.  And as far as the pain goes, yeah, it's a, it's a pretty good painful experience, but.  How long did it take them to laser your tongue from bleeding?  Um, bleeding-wise, if it, if, if, if it's a rapid procedure like mine was done professionally,  it, it was instant.  I mean, I, I wasn't, I didn't go through the process of the torture with a fishing line 
[01:23:00]  and trying to, basically all that does is rip your tongue.  Ah.  That, that is a old procedure right there.  And that was back before they started really, truly experimenting and getting the procedure  down.  And how, how bad does it hurt?  Um, I would say on a, I've got a pretty pain, good pain threshold.  Most people wouldn't be able to handle it very good. 
[01:23:30]  Um, I, I, I did a little bit of squealing, but not too bad.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Brett.  Brett in Iowa.  Thank you.  And have a good one.  And thank you, uh, Troy, Troy Kwan.  Tattoo talk with Troy Kwan.  I tell you, I got the phones ringing off the hook.  Well, we had three phone calls, Kenny.  Let's, uh, not get too excited.  Are you ready to produce, to produce the next segment?  I got to rest.  Well, we got George Wendt coming in next.  And then, uh, and then you, you give us something else we could do. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  After the break, can you at least tease what's coming up?  We got 10 minutes to figure it out.  Tease now?  No, you got 10 minutes.  All right.  Right after the break, you, you'll tell us what's coming up on the show.  Sure.  Your next, uh, segment that you're just producing on the fly.  Okay.  All right.  No problem.  George Wendt next.  Oh.  George Wendt making his way into the studio.  It's Opie and Jim Norton today. 
[01:24:30]  You doing good, Jimmy?  No, I'm, it's, my, my, my, I'm extraordinarily cranky today.  You're cranky?  I'm very tired, yeah.  I didn't sleep well.  You're cranky.  I'm, uh, not sleeping yet.  Having a, an eight year, eight year old, an eight day old in the old house.  House?  Uh, we got other things going on today as well.  Mike Baker's coming in as well.  He's, uh, spent 17 years in the CIA. 
[01:25:00]  Very smart guy.  I've done red eye with him many times.  Yeah.  With that Times Square incident, we had him on the phone.  He did a great job.  He's a bright dude.  And he's got a book or something.  He's promoting, right?  I don't know if he's just that or just promoting his security company.  I mean, uh.  Okay.  But he's in town, so he's coming by to say hi.  Yeah.  He was great on the phone, so.  And we got, uh, Nestor Carbonell calling in at like, at 10.  We only have him for 10 minutes.  He's, uh, Richard Alpert on Lost.  Cause it's, Lost is tonight.  And I think the season finale is Sunday.  And he's been, I've loved him this year.  Kind of a drop off with this whole Lost thing, huh? 
[01:25:30]  Tremendous, dude.  I mean, really bad.  But him, him is one guy, I don't have a problem.  I think he's great.  I mean, I still haven't seen one episode of Lost, but.  You know who he is?  He's in, uh, The Dark Knight.  He played the mayor.  Oh!  Okay, that's, that's.  Yeah, right on.  That's Nestor.  He's been, you'll know him as soon as you see him.  Yeah, sure.  But we're not gonna see him, cause he's gonna be on the phone.  Right, right, right.  Sam?  Oh, you're just coming in to film?  Yep.  Oh, Steve's walking him down from the, okay.  We, we, we never know when to bring a guest in.  Do we bring them in?  As, like, cause Steve always wants to walk them in.  Like, you know, look, I know they're not scheduled for 45 minutes, but. 
[01:26:00]  They're here.  They're here if you want me to.  Which sometimes makes sense, but.  I'm getting a text from Steve.  Are you?  Oh, okay.  What?  He said, Wendt is in bathroom.  Be right there.  Taking a beer shit.  Yeah.  George Wendt's taking a good hangover dump.  Enough about the beer.  George Wendt.  Wow, man. 
[01:26:30]  It's like, it's a weird day.  It is.  Like, the timing's off on everything.  And then it's like, all right, well, let's do our George Wendt interview.  And no, he's too busy taking a beer shit.  So now we gotta wait.  Well, just talk to him.  Kenny is working on his next segment.  Is he?  All right.  That's great.  Because the first one was just amazing.  So can't wait for the second one.  I don't know if it's great or not.  We got a salute to former intern Sean.  We can play right now for everybody.  Is Sean coming in, though, so we can get his side of the story?  Yeah.  As far as Troy Kwan going out with his girlfriend. 
[01:27:00]  Troy told that whole story yesterday.  Yeah, he'll come in.  He'll come in, what, Friday?  Maybe later this week.  Yeah.  On Friday?  Yeah, let's do that.  Here's George Wendt.  Oh, my God.  George.  George.  Are you good?  Good.  Good.  Sit.  How are you, George?  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Fresh as a daisy.  Yeah, yeah.  How did the bathroom go?  You all right?  Yeah.  You have cameras?  We have cameras in there, yeah.  Did you take a good one? 
[01:27:30]  It left my scent.  Huh?  I left my scent.  Are you going to drop a deuce before you came in?  Yeah.  Yeah, nice.  All right, here's the thing.  I want to talk about what he dropped.  Oh, yeah.  Was it solid or was it, you know, was it messy?  It's solid.  Solid?  Okay, that's good.  That's healthy.  I love the fact that you actually answered that question.  Why not?  What are we going to do?  Talk about cheers?  He doesn't want to hear about cheers.  Let's talk about our dumps for a while.  Are you tired of hearing about cheers? 
[01:28:00]  Whatever.  Okay.  You know, I don't have an agenda.  All right.  So what...  Other than I need coffee.  We could get you coffee.  No, it's actually...  Oh, is it?  The press rep is on her way.  What?  The press rep is on her way.  Okay.  Is she bringing your coffee?  Mm-hmm.  So you tired of...  You got you in...  Who played Cliff?  I don't know his name.  John Ratzenberg.  John Ratzenberg sued because they were using your likenesses in these cheers-like bars.  What was it?  In airports?  Yeah.  Were they mannequins? 
[01:28:30]  Were they dummies or just voices?  They were...  They were like...  Audio-animatronic...  Yeah.  Like robots.  Yeah.  Do you get tired of being...  As a guy who was...  You know, like you're...  It became a very iconic character.  Do you get tired of being associated with that, like as an actor?  Well, I don't spend much energy, like, worrying about it.  So, you know, it doesn't make me tired or anything.  But it's...  You know, it's not really anything I can control.  But have you gone out for things where they said, we want you for something, but they're 
[01:29:00]  like, ah, no, we associate you too much with that?  Oh, yeah, I should think, yeah.  Actually, they probably don't even see me, you know, based on that, if that's what they're  thinking.  Do you like television now?  Are we on radio now, by the way?  Yes, we are.  I just wondered.  I thought we were shooting the shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's...  That's actually a compliment.  That's a compliment.  That's how we do our radio show.  We don't need it all polished and nice, George.  We like to talk about your dump, a little cheers action, and we'll get you out of here  so you can go back to bed.  George is actually on the... 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, we are on the...  This is where we kind of talk.  You're not a morning person, are you?  No.  No.  Well, if you drink beer, it's tough to be a morning person.  Yeah, I was actually, you know, out with friends last night, and this really does not fit  into my schedule.  What time did you go home?  Not too bad.  I was 1230 or so, but left to my own devices, it would have been worse.  Really?  Yeah, but I, you know, I'm a professional.  So you went to bed, you had a few?  Yeah, I did.  Okay.  So you were...  Yeah, I did.  How many is a few? 
[01:30:00]  I don't...  Jeez, I don't know.  You don't really keep...  You don't keep track, right?  I don't keep track.  More than six?  Probably about six.  About six?  Maybe.  It would have been more if I had...  Didn't have a seven o'clock wake up.  Sure.  So, okay, so you know you have to get up and do radio this morning and promote the paperback.  That kind of sucks when you're out and you want to have a few more drinks and you got to...  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what are you going to do?  Yeah, the book's about beer.  The book's about beer, yeah.  So I was doing my research.  That's what I was doing.  Yeah, exactly.  It's an exhaustive research.  You should come in here really hungover. 
[01:30:30]  It would help sell the book, I'm thinking.  So you like a...  I'm sorry.  No, go, go.  Are you a hard drinker?  I mean, I was at one point, too.  Yeah, I wouldn't...  I wouldn't call it that hard, but...  You know, I drink pretty much every night.  Every night?  Unless I have some reason not to.  Yeah, that would be a hard drinker.  I mean...  You think so?  Yeah, man.  I mean, sure, sure, sure.  Good.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's cool to not have to get up, though.  Like, as a guy...  You're obviously set because you're... 
[01:31:00]  You know, here's an 11-year run you're on.  Yeah, I wouldn't call myself set.  No?  No, look at the look he gave you.  Crazy.  Well, you have five kids?  Yeah.  So, you know...  So you don't get the residual checks?  Yeah, I get the residual checks.  I mean, you get them, but I mean, they're not big checks, is what you're saying.  Yeah, they're okay.  You know, I just...  I need to keep working and all that.  So you get this impression that a guy does a show...  Like, cheers, you're set for life.  One of the biggest of all time.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I could be set for life if I had, like, no kids and lived in a, you know, 
[01:31:30]  double wide in Idaho or something.  You know, I'd be set for life.  Do you...  Are you a guy who is really responsible and smart with money?  Like, I gotta sock it away.  Are you one of those guys who's just, like, enjoy it while it's here?  I just enjoyed it.  And, you know, I did sock a good bit away, but, you know, just enough for the kids, college  and stuff.  So I thought, but no, not even close.  Really?  So as time has gone on, college has got more expensive. 
[01:32:00]  Cost of living goes up.  Yeah.  And now you're at a point where you're like, shit.  Yeah.  I better write a book or something.  Is that really, is that, that's, see, that's a, a very, are you scared?  Of...  Meaning, like, are you at a point where you're like, I'm a little worried here about the money?  Yeah.  Well, who isn't in this economy?  Mm-hmm.  Ted Danson, probably, you know?  Well, no, you'd be surprised.  Really?  Yeah.  He's always complaining. 
[01:32:30]  I'm like, what?  He's complaining about money?  You know, he has in the past, yeah.  Wow.  No kidding.  Yeah, I know.  Shocking.  You should have, has Ted...  He invited you to do his new show?  You were bored to death?  Yeah.  Uh, no.  But it's not his show, really.  Thanks.  Well, he's the star of the show, though, right?  Yeah, Ted is...  Well, I guess he's the biggest name, but...  Biggest name on the show.  ...like the lead guy or anything.  Yeah.  No, he's the second lead to Jason Schwartzman.  Yeah.  Uh, Jimmy, Jimmy did his show.  I did one episode.  I just...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you have something in common.  You both did, did, uh, work with Ted Danson. 
[01:33:00]  That's kind of cool, Jimmy.  I, he's actually very, like, a nice guy.  It's kind of intimidating.  It is with Ted Danson.  Yes, but...  That's right.  I had one liner.  As George, uh, doesn't get the phone call at home, you're hanging out with Ted Danson.  That's gotta be comfortable for everybody in the room.  But, no, you know what it is?  It's probably that it's, it's awkward to use people from the same show and different projects  because it all of a sudden associates everybody with the own show.  But I'm interested in the fact that you leave Cheers, or Cheers is done, and you think,  all right, for the rest of my life, I can just kind of cruise, do some plays, whatever, right? 
[01:33:30]  Just do what I want to do.  And when does the realization hit that, like, shit, the money, there is a cap on it?  Uh, it was a couple years ago.  A couple years ago?  Yeah.  My youngest is 20 now, so...  Oh, you're getting there.  Yeah, yeah.  You're getting there.  Yeah.  I'm almost off the hook.  Almost.  So what happened?  He was going to college and, uh...  Yeah, everybody.  Yeah, all of them, you know, like...  Are you, uh, are you married?  Yes.  All right.  I was wondering if there was a divorce in there because that could hurt.  Right.  Yeah.  Ooh, yeah, I guess.  Ooh, yeah.  Now, that might be why Ted was... 
[01:34:00]  Oh, is he, uh, is he a divorce?  All right, all right.  Oh, is he a divorce guy?  I didn't know that.  We don't need to get into that.  Have you done...  Have you done another series since then, or have you worked a lot, or no?  Yeah, I've done a couple of, um, short live series, and, uh, you know, it's, uh, tough  sledding out there, you know?  Uh, uh, I don't know, I don't know how to...  If anyone knew how to make something work, they'd do it all the time.  So it's, it's kind of an alchemy thing, you know?  It's kind of, you know... 
[01:34:30]  Although Ted's gone on three things.  For Becker and then this, yeah.  For Becker, damages, this other...  Is it depressing at all?  Um, when you look at...  I mean, well, you were an actor before that, right?  You're going out, you're doing auditions, and then you get cheers, and it goes to what  it goes to, and then when it's over, is it, does it become a point where it's like, eh,  it's, it's not like the star treatment anymore, do you get, is there a depression that comes  with that?  No.  No?  When, when, how long does it take to kind of... 
[01:35:00]  I hit home, like, okay, that's done now, I have to move on to something else.  Yeah, that's a bit of an adjustment, because, you know, it was rather dizzying heights, uh,  you know, there were parades thrown in our honor, you feel like the Pope, you know?  Like, thousands of people on the streets in Boston and stuff, and, and, and then, you  know, um, so it's a bit of an adjustment, but, uh, it was very sort of amorphous and  vague, and probably took, uh, you know, over the course of five years or something to... 
[01:35:30]  And then what, what, what was it?  It must have been something, like, was it something you wanted to do that you weren't  able to do, like a role you wanted to do, or what was it that hit you that you're like,  ugh, all right, now I have to kind of start over a little bit?  Um, nothing, uh, that I can think of right now that, that, uh, was a, a specific moment,  you know, but just in general, you know, you kind of don't get as many, uh, meetings or  something like that.  Calls don't come back as fast?  Yeah, yeah, sure. 
[01:36:00]  Do you watch the show when it's on?  No.  Why would he?  No, I mean, like, if I'm channel surfing and, and I run across it, you know, I may just  sort of stick with it until the next commercial, kind of going, huh, what was that bit?  Oh, yeah, yeah, that bit, and, um, that's all.  But do you, when you watch it, does it feel good, or does it, is there a kind of a bitterness  with it?  No, it's not bitterness at all, uh, but, uh, you know, it's just kind of, I guess I'm like 
[01:36:30]  any other American, it's just part of the landscape.  Sure, sure is.  So the drinking, I want to get back to the drinking, because I like the fact that George  was honest, and he said he drinks every night, um.  See, Jimmy, uh, stopped drinking and doing drugs at 17.  18.  18, I'm sorry, I was 18 years old.  He knew he just couldn't, uh, do the drinking thing there, George.  I was, I was not a functional guy when I drank.  Are you, as a guy who drinks every night, is it, have you had gigs that kind of got messed  up because of it, like you were supposed to have a call at 6 and you get there at 8, 
[01:37:00]  or?  No.  No, no, I don't, uh, when I say every night, it's not, um, that's if I'm left to my own  devices, you know.  Right.  If I, if I have, uh, something.  Like, for example, when my kids were in grade school, you know, like I would only drink on  weekends because, you know, I had to like hit the deck at 6.30 or something and, you know,  feed them, get them out the door, blah, blah, blah.  Because they don't understand hangovers, right, George?  That too.  And then the night before, I was always like, you know, now did you do homework and, you 
[01:37:30]  know, so, um, you know, I, I was a lot more responsible, but now I'm just sort of sliding,  sliding back into my, like, college days.  Where you can kind of do what you want?  Kind of, yeah, unless I have a gig.  Does it feel good or does it kind of feel like, uh, floating somewhere?  It feels fine.  I, I, frankly, I wish I was busier and then maybe I'd, you know, probably, you know, take  care of myself a little better if I was busier. 
[01:38:00]  You mean, uh, you mean eating better or do you mean, uh, drinking less?  Just drinking less.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well.  I eat well.  Are you, probably why.  Are you a vomiter?  I'm not working as much.  No.  You mean vomiter like.  Drinking?  No.  So you never throw it up?  No.  Yeah, I have.  Yeah.  Actually, I did it, um, when, a couple summers ago, my brother poisoned me.  And you threw up?  Yes.  It was, it was so frat boy.  It was like, yeah.  Are you a blackout drinker? 
[01:38:30]  No.  No, you remember everything?  Yeah.  You have to make the, some, I used to make the phone calls.  There's got to be some calls you make where you're like, uh, what exactly, where they  call you back and you try to piece together the night before, but you have to act  like, yeah, no, no, I remember that.  No, no.  No?  Uh-uh.  So you drink every night a lot, um, but it hasn't really affected you that badly?  Well, I don't know.  You know, uh, I'm obviously grossly overweight.  You know, maybe that's, you know, could have something to do with it.  Could be an effect. 
[01:39:00]  But, uh, um, no, other than that, I wouldn't say.  Yeah.  Does, does the weight, is it, uh, something like, for me, it's sex, you know?  I mean, eating is tough.  I think eating and sex are very similar because you can't be abstinent.  Like, you know what I mean?  You can, you can not drink, you can not do drugs, but you can't not fuck or you can't  not be sexual.  You can't not eat.  So is it, is it been something that's always been a struggle for you where you're like,  all right, I kind of want to fix this or, I mean, how do you kind of take that on?  What?  The weight, yeah.  The weight?  You know, just try to, you know, exercise a lot and, uh, it, if, if I, you know, obviously 
[01:39:30]  I know how to lose weight.  The hard part's keeping it off.  So, I mean, it's, it's kind of fun to lose weight, you know, cause it's all very active  and, you know, um, when are you going to do that?  Yeah, you can do, you know, you can do it pretty easy.  Oh, yeah.  It's just, uh, you know, cause it's just like maybe several weeks and it's like, you know,  people are like, oh my God, you look fabulous.  Yeah.  Right.  And then it's just gets really boring.  And it kind of motivates you to lose more for, right. 
[01:40:00]  Then you go right back to.  Sounds like you need beer, George.  I think that's what Jimmy's getting at.  You need beer.  No, George kind of, you seem, talking to you seem like a little, I know you're tired too  cause morning radio is a bitch.  Yeah.  But you seem a little bummed.  A little bit.  Yeah, slightly bummed.  Oh, geez.  I don't know.  But, you know, maybe if we change the subject, maybe I wouldn't be, but.  Oh, okay.  All right.  But that's, you know, you can talk.  Well, it's hard to change the subject when the book is called Drinking with George.  Yeah, I guess that's what kind of motivated me to talk about it. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, okay.  Because it leads into the book, A Barstool Professional's Guide to Beer, Drinking with George.  Yeah, that's kind of.  Yeah, it's fun.  Yeah, that's it.  It's a laugh a minute.  Well, what can you tell us about the book there, George?  Uh, it's just a couple dozen anecdotes from my life, um, regarding beer, you know, involving  beer in general.  And, uh, there's all sorts of tidbits, uh, you know, uh, little factoids about beer and 
[01:41:00]  stuff like that.  What made you want to write a book about, obviously you like to drink, but what made you want to  write a book about beer?  You want, like, cause your life is probably interesting.  I mean, you know, again, you're a guy that already knows.  So what made you want to just tie the alcohol in with it?  Um, just kind of, uh, playing off my image from the show.  Yeah, his character was known to, you know, tip a few back.  Do you get to a point when you're doing a show, like, where you're on for a long time,  where you start to want to change direction in the way they're portraying you? 
[01:41:30]  I think they said Larry Linville from MASH, who was Frank Burns, they said that was, the  producers always said that was one mistake they made, was they never allowed him to kind  of go beyond just being idiot Frank Burns, like everybody else evolved, but he didn't  really evolve.  As a character, when you're doing something for 11 years, do you get to a point where  you want to, like, hey, I want this guy to be taken more seriously, or I want this guy  to do this, or whatever it is?  Uh, didn't, uh, didn't happen to me.  I didn't feel that way.  It was a big group of, uh, folks.  There was, uh, you know, seven or eight of us usually, uh, you know, series regulars, 
[01:42:00]  and it's only 22 minutes.  So, you kind of had to, uh, you know, make do with, with your little angle of the show  that week, whether it was, uh, you know, whether it was the story was about you, or whether  the B story was about you, or, you know, whether it was the story was about you, or whether  the B story was about you, or, uh, you know, it didn't really matter.  How about Kirstie Alley? 
[01:42:30]  You, you, you mean, obviously you know her well.  She's making a weird living now.  Like, it's a weird, it's, it's kind of like, it's something that obviously hurts her, is  being, the weight, and she keeps going, like, kind of.  She's pretty fat.  She is, but she's, like, trying to take it.  No one ever thought she would become a, a big girl, George.  Did you see it on set at Cheers?  No.  Yeah, she's, like, a completely different person now.  But what's interesting to me is not the fact that she's heavier, it's the way that she's,  it's almost like taking something that hurts you, and owning it, to make, to make it comfortable.  Like, you know what I mean? 
[01:43:00]  It's like, you know, I'm, for me, I'm a perv.  Yeah, I get hooked, all that shit.  So, a way of me not helping it, and a way of me fucking owning it, and using it in my,  you understand what I'm saying?  That's kind of what she's, seems to have done.  Yeah, I don't know, um, yeah.  You don't, you don't talk to her anymore?  Yeah, I speak with her now and then.  Now and then?  Yeah.  She's, uh, hilarious.  But does she get tired of the whole, uh, the fat actress thing, or is she comfortable with it?  I haven't spoken with her about these issues, you know, whether she's, she's tired of that, 
[01:43:30]  or, or, you know, tired of tabloids, and, you know, it's not really what we talk about,  but, so I can't, uh, speak for her, you know, and she speaks so well for herself, so.  Yeah, she is.  I mean, I'm just kind of, uh, I guess from my own experience, just interested.  That's all.  Yeah.  You know, I, I, uh, I read, uh, half your book, George, and I didn't get to the end where  you have a whole chapter on rehab, I noticed.  I didn't get there yet.  What's your thoughts on rehab?  Because there's a quote that starts the chapter, it says, why is it that when you drink seven 
[01:44:00]  nights a week in college, you're a partier, but after that, you're an alcoholic?  So you don't believe in rehab, right?  Well, yeah, no, I, I have lots of, uh, friends and, and family indeed in rehab and, um, you  know, uh, rehab, well, in recovery, as they say.  Recovery, sure, yeah.  And, uh, and, you know, I think it's awesome and, uh, you know, I've thought about it as  a career move, um, you know, cause I think there's some serious networking done at those 
[01:44:30]  meetings, you know, like, uh, but, uh, I've, I've also thought about becoming a Cub fan as  a career move, um, just cause all the cool guys are.  But have you thought about quitting?  Like, uh, I think I'm not saying you need to, I just don't know you.  Yeah, no, I've, I've quit from time to time.  Um, not in a comprehensive way where I've joined the program or anything like that, but,  uh, just out of discipline, you know.  Just because you say, like, all right, I know this might be getting a little out of hand,  so I want to see if I can do it for X amount of time.  No, not because I thought it was getting out of hand, just because, um, you know, I was 
[01:45:00]  on a diet or because, you know, I just felt like it.  What's the longest you were able to stop?  What that you chose to stop?  Six weeks, maybe a couple months, something like that.  How good did that first one feel?  That was great.  I was in Amsterdam.  I was like, I know I'm going to drink again, you know, have a beer again.  Yeah.  So, like, if I don't have a beer in Amsterdam and then I'm going to be, like, you know,  down at the corner and just kind of have some crap beer. 
[01:45:30]  When you were, you kind of, it's kind of hard when you're portrayed as a guy in a show  who drinks, that's your thing.  You know, you're the guy who's sitting there with a beer, you're Norm.  Were you, did that kind of make you drink more or were you, like, was that the guy you  were when you kind of came in?  Kind of was the guy when I came in.  The lifetime in the making, the preparation for the role.  And it happened to work out and it happened to give you a great role.  Yeah.  So you write a book about drinking.  I don't mean to obsess over the drinking, it's just, it is the book.  Yeah, it is the book.  Because to me, we write what we know. 
[01:46:00]  You know what I mean?  I've written stuff and it's like you kind of write with the stuff that's good about you  and the stuff that's bad about you.  So to me, like, the fact that George wrote this, and you could have written about anything  because, again, you are who you are.  It says something.  It's like, I know you love beer and it's fun, but to me, that's like, ah, that's owning  something that is, at times, maybe frightening.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  Kind of like the Kirstie thing?  In a way, for me, the sex.  Yeah, or in a way, owning stuff that is, or somehow taking something that's bad and hurting 
[01:46:30]  me and making it work for me.  That's just why, I guess that's why I'm talking on it.  That's okay.  You can talk whatever you want.  Now, this is the soft cover, right?  Paperback.  Paperback, I mean.  So did you add anything to the paperback?  That wasn't in the original book?  I added one more thank you or something.  That was it.  The cover's softer.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Good for you, man.  Did you, uh. 
[01:47:00]  Why would I add to, you know.  Well, no, that's what people do to sell more.  Yeah, I copied.  Oh.  You add a little to the paperback.  So the people, yeah, the people that bought the hardcover go, wow, now I need the paperback  because he added a chapter.  Yes.  I've added chapters to both books and paperback because it kind of motivated people to go out  like, because they're like, why would I buy the same book I have?  Okay.  That's what we're saying.  It kind of, yeah, all right, I'll buy it because it's 15 bucks instead of 25 bucks.  Yeah.  It's got an extra chapter in it.  Yeah, that's all I was thinking, but I guess, you know.  Let me go to the phones.  Kevin from Connecticut. 
[01:47:30]  We've got George Wendt in studio from Cheers fame, of course.  Kevin, what do you got?  Norm!  He can't hear you, buddy.  He's got a George Wendt.  He yelled Norm, which is kind of fun.  I could hear that, actually.  Yeah, it's fun, right?  From the table.  Fun for everyone.  Kevin, what do you got?  When you were on Cheers, did you actually drink beer?  Nah.  It was fake beer, non-alcoholic beer.  Couldn't drink it?  The director thought we'd cast Mike at sluggish, according to our director.  I'm having real beer right now for you, buddy. 
[01:48:00]  Really?  All right.  Now, there was never a time that there was a real beer just for the hell of it.  Oh, yeah.  Towards the end of the evening, we convinced the prop man to slip some real beers in because  we were mostly done.  Yeah.  They had their takes and, you know.  Sure.  Why not enjoy a beer?  What's that, sir?  One last thing.  Sure.  Love you in Dreamscape, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  Dreamscape.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Thank you.  Let me say hi to Greg in Jersey.  Greg?  Hey, what's up, George? 
[01:48:30]  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, George.  I was at the, I was a Paramount VIP for the last episode.  Mm-hmm.  What time did you guys start drinking?  Because the whole cast, you guys were all shit-faced.  You talking about in Boston when the episode aired?  Correct.  We started drinking when the show aired, you know, when we got there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And it was a two-hour show, and nobody thought to feed us, and we were just a little lit up.  Oh, a bunch of booze, no food. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Was it, is it hard?  No, I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  Stop being such a freaking downer, too.  Let the guy drink.  I'm not being a downer, not letting him drink.  Yeah, really.  Sorry.  It's like, I believe me, I relate to George in a certain way, and he's written a book  about something.  So what kind of an idiot would I be if I didn't talk about the guy who's, he comes in, he goes,  and this, I'm not saying, how you doing?  I am hungover.  All right, my book.  What's it called?  Drinking with George.  All right, well, how do we not go there?  To me, that's really interesting.  Of course.  That's great.  I didn't say I was hungover.  I hadn't had coffee yet.  All right, you're correct.  I did say that.  It's a big part of his life, the beer. 
[01:49:30]  It is.  Do you drink anything else?  Yeah, the Odd Shooters.  The Odd Shooters, sure.  So what is your, I guess, what's your favorite beer?  I have to ask you that.  Oh, that's a great question.  You know, honestly, I don't, you know, I'm a creature of whim.  Like, I just, like, can stand there.  Let's make history today, because I know you've never said what your favorite beer is.  Let's make history today.  What's your favorite beer, if I had to say?  I swear to God, I can't do it.  I believe him, too. 
[01:50:00]  I really do.  What is, what beer sucks?  There's got to be one that you won't drink.  I don't really like the, some of the, the new craft brews that are, like, seasonal and fruity and pumpkin-y and raspberry, you know, those sorts of types.  You want to taste like fucking beer.  Yeah, yeah, I like beer.  And yellow or, you know, dark or in between, you know, I'm sort of digging the craft brews, obviously.  But, you know, I'll just grab a six-pack of anything, you know, depending on, you know, how I feel. 
[01:50:30]  I used to drink, uh, beer I found was awful, was, because, you know, I was young, I couldn't have no money.  So one of them was Meister, you ever drink Meister Brau?  Meister Brau.  Yeah, it's fucking terrible, but you can get a case for it.  Oh!  But we never drank a cold.  We only drank a warm.  Okay, see, that's a problem.  You gotta, you gotta, yeah, you gotta chill it up a little bit.  Eight bucks for a case of beer.  So you could drink Meister Brau?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  George is definitely a fucking drinker.  Anyone who says Meister Brau, that's not bad.  Sure.  It was terrible.  Really?  Oh!  When will you have your first beer today?  Yeah, what time?  We don't have any here.  We'd offer you a...  Yeah.  It would be kind of fun if he was drinking a beer while talking about his drinking with George book.  Yeah, right, right.  Why not?  I'll have a coffee.  Because I don't drink in the daytime.  You started pretty much, you make yourself wait till...  Yeah.  That's why I hate, like, daylight savings.  I was like, what the hell?  Come on, go down already.  Are the shakes real bad as you wait to... 
[01:51:30]  Wait for the sun to go down?  Yeah, I'm shaking away.  No, but have you had...  Do you make yourself wait?  Like, I'd like to indulge a little bit, but I better wait until...  Yeah.  Yeah, actually.  You know, like, when the game comes on at, like, you know, six out west or something,  then I'm kind of like, hmm, it's like still two hours of daylight.  I don't really...  You know, so you're a little bit thrown off.  Right, right, right.  Does the wife give you crap about it?  Are the kids like, yeah, come on.  No.  No, they don't care.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:52:00]  Let me say hi to Steve in Florida.  We got George Wendt in studio.  Hey, George.  How you doing?  Good.  Listen, I saw you at the Great American Beer Fest in Denver, Colorado.  Tell us a little bit about that.  I know you made the appearance, I guess.  Yeah.  You kind of signed in some autographs or whatever, but did you get to, you know, enjoy the beer?  And what did you think about the different regions and all?  It's really kind of shocking, the quality of the craft brew, you know, movement in America,  at least, I'm sure, all over the world.  But it just blows my mind. 
[01:52:30]  Like, everything is just ridiculously good.  What was this beer event?  Oh, Great American Beer Festival in Denver.  And it's probably the, they give out awards, and it's probably the biggest award thing for America.  For the beer itself?  For beers, various beers, various categories of beers.  Did you go out there, or did they bring you out as a celebrity?  I think I went out there by way of trying to promote my book. 
[01:53:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  So you went out there to kind of be around a bunch of other...  Drunks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't, my book wasn't released yet, so it was kind of not the best timing in the  world, because I couldn't really sell any or sign any or how they do, you know.  How many, well before the book came out, did you promote there?  Kind of just a few weeks before.  So, the timing was bad, but I'll go back, say, next year, if possible, and, you know, 
[01:53:30]  be, like, selling the merch, if you will.  Do you think television now is, what happens, you know, I find there's no, there's getting  a bunch of shit now on Family Guy because of some anti-Vietnam War joke or whatever,  but doesn't it seem like the only place we allow any type of edgy comedy anymore on  TV is in cartoons?  I mean, what do you think, as a guy who was in a successful show, about what's, what is  being passed off, I guess, as edgy comedy or whatever, on sitcoms now?  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  I don't pay much attention to a lot of shows, so I'm not a good person to answer that, but,  you know, a lot of the comedy is very soft, and if they try to be edgy, it's, yeah, it's  really more fun on the, on the, on the cartoons because they're just so fast, like, for example,  Family Guy, it's just hilarious, but they, they say stuff, and it just, it's over, and  it's like, did he, whoa, what?  Yeah.  You know, and the references are so fast and funny that, you know, it's, it's like a freight 
[01:54:30]  train, you just can't.  You guys want the clip that, you're referencing, Jim?  Yeah.  So I have it if you want.  Okay, yeah, this was on this week's, I think, South Park.  Sunday's Family Guy.  Sunday's, oh, Family Guy, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  If it ever goes.  There is actually, it's actually a very funny part in this where they have the, it's not  playing, there's two monuments, they show the Washington Monument, oh.  There it is, Washington, D.C., the seat of government for the world's former most powerful 
[01:55:00]  nation.  Wow, those are all the monuments I read about in school.  There's the Washington Monument.  Washington Monument.  There's the Obama Monument.  It's black, much bigger.  See, because.  And there's the Vietnam War Memorial.  Hey, check out that Vietnamese guy giving the business to those Vietnam vets.  Scoreboard!  Scoreboard!  Oh, what happened to your friend?  Hey, I know that guy.  I killed him.  He cried like a bitch.  Vietnam, undefeated!  Wow. 
[01:55:30]  Wow.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  Wow.  So, you don't really watch most of sitcoms or anything like that?  Not really.  I think, like, Curb Your Enthusiasm, I'll watch.  It's not judgmental or anything.  I'm judging.  I think most of it's terrible.  Because I think they're too afraid of being offensive.  They're too afraid of getting the letters from people.  I mean, even, you know, Sam Malone.  You know, he's just a drinker who wanted to bang a bunch of chicks in a bar.  Oh, you know, he's in recovery, but he wanted to bang a bunch of chicks. 
[01:56:00]  And the idea of wanting to bang a bunch of girls now in a sitcom,  they'd probably go, well, it's not really likable.  He should, you know, he should be.  Except for Charlie Sheen does that.  In real life, yeah.  Well, no, I think it's a show.  So, come on now.  I'm hearing that George has to go.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're saying you gotta go.  The book is called.  I mean, we could talk to you all day.  It's called.  He's gotta go.  Yeah.  Drinking with George, a Barstool Professional's Guide to Beer.  Have you done signings and stuff?  Yeah.  All right.  Are you doing any for this now on the software?  I don't think, no. 
[01:56:30]  Did you want to do promo for this?  Are they kind of like, you gotta get out and do some promo?  No, I think I wanted to do it.  I mean, I definitely wanted to do it.  What else are you doing?  Not much.  He's drinking beer.  I'm doing a lot of theater lately.  Oh, you are doing?  Oh, I mean, I meant for the book.  Oh, for the book, yeah.  Various radio and that's about it.  Are you doing plays?  Yeah.  Do you like theater acting?  Yeah.  I'm terrible at it.  I've tried it.  It's fucking hard, man.  Because you have to kind of project out, but not look like you're talking unnaturally. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, and then they mic you these days, which is a bit odd.  So it's a bit of adjustment if you're not mic'd.  How much do you despise cell phones and beepers and all that shit?  It's all right.  It doesn't bother me that much.  But it's pretty funny how they go off sometimes.  He's got to go.  I really haven't hit one thing that George relates to.  I suck.  My apologies, Mr. Lynch.  No, it was a fine interview, but they're saying he really has to go.  I don't know what you're talking about, but if you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  I thought I was here until 8.30. 
[01:57:30]  We're waiting a word.  Unless I misheard, I was told he had to be somewhere at 8.30.  Ah, see?  See, George?  I wasn't giving you the hook.  Got to be across the street at night.  Oh, they gave us the wrong information.  We have you at 7.45, and we have Mike Baker.  There you go.  See, you've got somebody waiting in the way.  No, no, no, but we have him at 8.15, but I think we were told that you had to leave at 8.15.  Whatever.  Peachy.  All right.  Well, what's going on?  I do what I'm told.  I don't care. 
[01:58:00]  You don't care?  What happened?  I don't know.  I really...  I don't think George is happy, and I like George.  I don't feel like he's happy, and I don't know why.  I don't want you to be upset with us.  No, I'm fine.  I thought he had to go.  That's all.  I wasn't giving you the hook.  Now I feel awkward.  No, I don't feel awkward.  I got to pee anyway.  I mean, we talked for a half hour.  That's fine.  But, you know...  Cool.  Mike Baker is here, so I guess we should take a break.  All right.  Because I'm going to take a leak. 
[01:58:30]  But I have the feeling...  I feel like you're annoyed at this.  I don't want you to be annoyed at this.  You're right, George?  It's fine.  All right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Did we go too far with the drinking, maybe?  It wasn't intentional.  It was all based on the book.  Good for you.  It was all based on the book, Drinking with George.  I mean, no, we weren't...  Look, I wasn't talking about that to make you uncomfortable.  It's simply something I talk...  We do five hours a day here, so you kind of cover everything for a long period of time.  Sure.  You know, I've talked a lot about my own drinking, my own, I guess, demons. 
[01:59:00]  And, you know, I don't know.  It's like he's got demons.  Like any of us do.  I mean, I don't think George...  What's your demons, George?  Gosh.  I don't know.  I never thought about it.  Children.  You don't like children?  No.  I want to hug George.  I really like George Wendt.  Can you give Jimmy a hug?  Before we go, I don't know if he wants to hug.  We're going to hug.  We're going to hug.  Like men.  I don't mean...  I don't know. 
[01:59:30]  Soft.  Like a Viking.  Yeah.  Like men.  Like men.  How a men hug.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, this ended a little awkwardly.  Let's be honest.  It was an odd time for all of us.  I think George hates us now.  I don't want George to hate us, for real.  I want George to come back and enjoy our show.  All right.  All right.  Well, I do have to leak.  So, we'll take a leak.  Hold on.  We're all going to break.  Yeah.  That was all right, man.  I don't want George to leave while we're talking.  Kenny? 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Kenny.  Oh, I want to take a photo with him.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, are you on a commercial break now?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Thanks for coming in, sir.  Sure.  Marge, can you photograph Mr. Wett and myself?  He was a very nice guy.  He's going to be getting a photograph with George Wett.  The great George Wett.  That's what I say, George.  Thanks.  Thank you, George.  Lid for my...  Thank you. 
[02:00:30]  I'm going to take a lid.  My morning drug.  Okay.  Huh?  That was good.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah, no problem, man.  Good luck with the book.  Enjoy it.  All right.  Be well, George.  There goes George Wett.  The great George Wett.  I do have to piss.  Huh?  I do have to piss.  Speaker on the hallway.  Eric's trying to get something signed. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, okay.  Coming up, my next segment.  Oh, what's your next segment, Kenny?  Well, you'll have to sit through the commercials.  Are you excited about the next segment as you produce the show today?  Yes, sir.  It's one of those really, really weird days.  It's a great day.  It is a great day.  Yeah, it's raining in New York.  Yeah.  The only thing that would make it better is thunder and lightning.  Yeah.  What's up, Jimmy?  He wasn't. 
[02:01:30]  He's a nice guy.  He strikes me as very sad.  He strikes me as a really sad guy.  Like, I feel like we missed something with him.  He hasn't done a fucking thing since Cheers.  But I mean, like, he's, like, it's like, eh, he's on the edge of.  Dude, he's a mess.  Yeah, he is a mess.  What's wrong, Sam?  He was a nice guy.  Sam.  Mr. Wendt chose not to do liners for the show.  Oh, no?  No.  All right.  Wait, ask him why.  Bring him back in.  No, no.  Bring him back in.  Bring him back in.  Bring him back in here. 
[02:02:00]  Eric.  Iraq, get him.  Iraq.  He's not mad.  He just has no idea what all this was, what happened.  Wait, bring him back.  Go get him.  Go get him.  Tell him we're back on the air.  Well, what was weird, though, is, like, I was being very honest with the guy.  Look.  I wasn't being rude to him.  Was I rude to him?  No.  He's a very talented guy.  He's not working because he's drinking too much.  And that's sort of what you were trying to get at, subtly, without being a dick. 
[02:02:30]  But I wasn't, I was always, like, trying to get him to talk about it because, to me,  that's interesting.  It's like, I mean, I would talk about.  Oh, he rocks back.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Yeah, he's done.  Fuck him.  Well, I asked him, I said, we just came back, they just finished doing live reads,  we wanted to see if you had more time, would you like to come back on and continue?  And he goes, no, I really have nothing to, nothing more to say here, so.  But he had nothing to say to begin with. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, he was very, I wonder if he heard any of the show before.  No.  You see him, he's a mess.  Yeah, he's tired and he's very hungover, in my opinion.  I think he's also probably hypersensitive to the alcoholism thing.  No, I understand he is.  He doesn't want people to take drinking out of the context of it's a fun thing.  No, I understand that.  But he wanted us to just keep the drinking as a fun thing, which is...  I can't do that.  Like, I don't...  That's tough for Jimmy. 
[02:03:30]  Because it's not honest.  It's like, I'm honest about what I am.  And where you come from, that's almost impossible to do.  You've seen what drinking can do to you personally and the people around you.  So it's tough for Jimmy just to turn all that off and go, okay, drinking is fun.  Yay.  But you know when Ozzy's here, he'll talk about the horror stories.  But it's never a bummy interview.  It's always a fun interview.  And yet he's talking, you know, he admits that he almost choked his wife.  Or he talks about the horrific things.  And when a guy comes in after writing a book about beer, he says, I'm like too tired. 
[02:04:00]  You have to ask.  Sam nailed it, though.  Yeah.  His book is called Drinking with George.  It's all just fun things about drinking.  The rehab quote I read, you know, we twisted that around.  And he wanted us to just keep it all fun, like beer is fun.  I didn't think it was a party.  And, you know, and we took a serious approach with that.  And he was not prepared.  Trying to ask him real questions.  Like what happens when do you feel like the money's going to run?  I'm interested in that.  A guy's been on top for 11 years.  I don't know, man.  I apologize if I fucked up.  I don't think you fucked up. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  I mean, I think we did our best with him.  I don't think it's one for the ages, right?  Not at all.  But to me, the interesting part of that was his.  They're saying you got to go, what?  Really?  What?  Who?  No, they didn't.  What happened?  Apparently, George Wentz's Wikipedia has been updated since this interview.  And what does it say?  He's a nice guy.  He's a very nice guy.  It says.  He looks like he's in rough shape, though, man. 
[02:05:00]  Ted Danson doesn't look like that.  Even Fat Christy Alley doesn't look like that.  And he mentioned the weight.  Woody Harrelson doesn't look like that.  Shelley Long doesn't look like that.  Jay Thomas doesn't look like that.  We see him every day.  George has, in my opinion, a drinking problem that's getting in the way of some things.  Maybe it's not our place to have an intervention with a fucking sitcom legend.  I didn't want to have an intervention.  It was just like, if you're talking about it, if you write a book about it.  Again, I know what this is because I wrote a book about it. 
[02:05:30]  About the fucking perversion.  I get it.  She's doing Fat Actors.  It all ties in.  We're all fucking addicts on some level.  So just, come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talk about what it's doing to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  To me, that's more interesting than...  What was he talking about?  Like a workout program.  What is he talking about?  When did he...  What?  He exercises.  I said, when are you going to start?  I didn't know.  Mars, did you like that interview?  It was a little slow. 
[02:06:00]  A little slow?  Just a little slow.  To me, he just seemed...  He didn't seem like a dick, though.  He seemed really depressed and really bummed out.  I think because we took the serious approach.  I think he really wanted to keep it fun with just beer.  Beer, fun, drink, fun.  But he wasn't in a fun vibe when he came in.  It's true.  He came in very low energy.  He came in very low energy, like a guy who had had too many beers last night.  So how do you not talk?  What are we going to...  His eyes look like he's dealing with maybe too many beers last night.  All right.  Well, if the listeners are annoyed, I'll take the hit on this one. 
[02:06:30]  No, no.  They, uh...  No, they're all right.  You did a great job.  What are we going to do?  We're not going to keep beer fun when there's another angle we could take.  Your angle was great.  I don't even mind keeping beer fun if he was in a fun mood.  What?  Dang.  Instant feedback made me laugh.  Somebody on a cell phone says, how does coach look?  That just made me giggle.  All right.  Good.  If he came in, like, in a kind of a jocular, upbeat mood, went, hey, guys, hey, what's 
[02:07:00]  up, man?  I'm just drinking.  Then you do the interview.  But when a guy comes in and he looks like he just needs to be laid down and have a fucking  and be held...  Where do you think it went wrong when I mentioned that Ted Danson hasn't called him yet, but  Jimmy has done the show with him?  No, he was bummed before that.  The drinking got him, I think.  What was the first question?  No, he sat down weird.  Oh, when we talked about his liquid dump?  Oh, yeah, because he was squeezing one out in the bathroom. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, yeah, and you asked for a solid.  Carolina man says that was radio molasses.  I was also glad that he wasn't wearing headphones when you mumbled, ha, ha, ha, this sucks.  I mean, well, kind of did, though.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to try to beat the guy up.  No.  He wasn't a jerk or anything, but it was just very...  It was like the proverbial pulling teeth, though. 
[02:08:00]  You want the beginning?  Because Travis has it if you want.  Yeah, what's the beginning?  Yeah, let's see where it went wrong.  George went.  Wow, man.  He did go.  It's a weird day.  It is.  Like, the timing's off on everything.  And then it's like, all right, well, let's do our George Wynn interview.  And no, he's too busy taking a beer shit.  Now we've got to wait.  Kenny is working on his next segment.  Is he?  All right, that's great, because the first one was just amazing.  So I can't wait for the second one.  I don't know if it's great or not.  We got a salute to former intern Sean we could play right now for everybody. 
[02:08:30]  Is Sean coming in, though, so we could get his side of the story?  Yeah.  As far as Troy Kwan going out with his girlfriend?  Troy told that whole story yesterday?  Yeah, he'll come in.  He'll come in?  What, Friday?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, let's do that.  Here's George Wynn.  Oh, my God.  All right.  George.  Can you pause that, Travis?  Thank you.  That was me reacting to what he looked like. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  He came in here really slow.  His eyes were like.  He looked really tired, possibly hungover.  I don't know.  And that's why the Jesus Christ, like, oh, this is going to be rough.  Yeah.  All right, continue, Travis.  Oh, my God.  George.  George.  How are you, George?  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Fresh as a daisy?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:09:30]  How did the bathroom go?  You all right?  Yeah.  You have cameras?  We have cameras in there, yeah.  Did you take a good one?  It left my scent.  Huh?  I left my scent.  Are you going to drop a deuce before you came in?  Yeah.  Yeah, nice.  All right, here's the thing.  I want to talk about what he dropped.  Oh, yeah.  Was it solid or was it, you know, was it messy?  It's solid.  Solid?  Okay, that's good.  That's healthy.  I love the fact that you actually answered that question. 
[02:10:00]  Why not?  What are we going to do?  Talk about cheers?  He doesn't want to hear about cheers.  I know.  Let's talk about our dumps for a while.  Are you tired of hearing about cheers?  Whatever.  Okay.  You know, I don't have an agenda.  All right.  So, what, what, uh...  Other than I need coffee.  You need...  We could get you coffee.  No, it's actually, uh...  Oh, it was a good...  The, uh...  The press rep is on her way.  The what?  The press rep is on her way.  Okay.  All right.  She bringing your coffee?  You can stop this.  He didn't realize that you guys were on the air when you were...  When he was talking about his dumps. 
[02:10:30]  Well, how about the on-air light was on?  Fair.  I mean, I'm not saying you're to blame, but...  I mean, you said, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I did, right?  Yeah, we have headphones on.  See, that was rough right from the...  We have headphones on.  Well, you're talking into mics, which is not...  Right.  Which is not a normal practice when you're not doing a radio show.  That was rough.  What do you do with that?  The first minute was like, all right, we joke a little bit and then get into...  Right.  But he seemed very down.  Yeah, we were trying to get the energy up and get a rhythm going.  And, you know, it started out okay.  It could have went much better from that point, but never did. 
[02:11:00]  Oof.  Are you just annoyed by it?  No.  No, no, no, no.  He's not.  Because he wasn't being mean or...  He wasn't trying to be a dick.  He's just hung over and a little bummed.  I think it really gets to him.  He's probably running out of money.  I don't know if he is or not, but that's the indication I got.  He's got to do something about it.  It's rough.  It's rough when you're fucking on top for all those years.  Right.  Yeah, he had a great run.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We've got Mike Baker coming in, right?  Yes, we do.  He's going to be a great guest. 
[02:11:30]  I hope he's hung over.  How great would that be?  That would be wonderful.  He's just sad and bummed out.  That would be wonderful.  And Club Soda Kenny's next segment as he attempts to produce the show today a little bit.  Yes, sir.  Can you announce the next segment just so people can look forward to it?  So they have something to look forward to today?  Coming up on the Opie and Anthony show,  Opie and Anthony blind item gossip.  Gossip.  Really?  I'll say.  You're one of those gossip people now?

[02:13:30]  I don't give a shit.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like through,  you know, the air satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi.  Whatever.  Here's the thing.  But I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need like an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really...  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  We sell products. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but like, I mean, did you get into your router  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look in there.  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here.  Yeah, exactly right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works. 
[02:14:30]  Are you talking about the hot, what, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet cable?  Yeah, they call them, I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need like a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just, let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay? 
[02:15:00]  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  Five, I'm not helping you. 
[02:15:30]  I think somebody sent up a fan page.  I'm hanging up!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  All right.  I'm not on. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, we're on.  It's me and Jimmy today.  I was telling these guys I loved the George Wendt interview because it was so weird and  bizarre and awkward and we all remember Norm from Cheers as being the fun guy.  Everybody wanted to be around him and we got a much different Norm today.  We tried everything.  Yeah.  We really did.  And now he's mad at us and I don't even know why. 
[02:16:30]  Why is he mad at us?  What were we supposed to do?  Because he's hung.  Here's why he's mad at us.  Because he's probably tired.  Maybe he's not feeling up to sorts.  Yeah, we don't know.  And then he's immediately confronted with questions about alcoholism.  And people are like, why couldn't you keep it fun?  Like, you know.  Oh, fuck.  Whoever said that could fuck my dick.  No, I laugh though because they're like, why couldn't you just keep it fun? 
[02:17:00]  You know, beer is fun type of thing because it's George Wendt.  That's boring.  Thank you.  Who gives a shit?  Thank you.  I think to go the other way and make it uncomfortable for everybody was the way to go.  But to me, it was only what interests me.  Like, I didn't think that you can do a lot with somebody who just thinks beer.  Like, yeah, beer is cool.  Yeah, I love beer.  Beer.  Right.  Right, Danny?  Fuck, I'm 40.  What, were we supposed to keep it fun?  Huh?  What's some of them other kind of beers we got?  No kidding.  But I said he couldn't even name a beer that he sort of likes the best. 
[02:17:30]  I even go, hey, what's your favorite beer?  I go, if you had to say.  Danny, if you had to say, what's your favorite beer?  I'm a Guinness man.  I would say Corona, which is, I know.  But I would say Corona.  I think you know, especially if you're writing a book that's based around beer and drinking it.  I'm pretty sure you have your favorites and your least favorites.  I should ask, what's your top ten favorite beers?  Then maybe.  Maybe he didn't want to commit to any beer because he's waiting for that big endorsement still.  I know what beers I don't like.  Did he do the Miller commercials? 
[02:18:00]  Did George White ever do a beer commercial?  I'll have to look it up.  I'm not sure.  Because maybe he's holding out because he's like, well, if I mention Budweiser, then I  won't get, you know, Coors or whoever, you know, calling me for the big beer endorsement.  I don't know.  Coors?  Hey, Kenny, what's going on?  Kenny's producing the show today, or sort of producing the show today.  He's helping us out because everyone has to step up today.  Yeah, good morning.  And let me tell you, it's a terrific show. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, what do you like about it so far?  Just the awkwardness of everything.  I don't want to hear that one, Sam.  I'm just saying, I don't know why you guys are saying that the whole show has been a bizarro  show from the get-go.  Yeah, you're listening to one of those.  Look, and call last minute.  We're making this up as we go.  I could have said, fuck it, Jimmy.  You could have said, fuck it.  I got a newborn at home.  I could go home.  And no one's going to question it.  I would have been in this mood with Ann here, too. 
[02:19:00]  Honestly, I would have been in a weird mood today.  No, I'm not in a bad mood or anything.  I'm just saying that, you know, that started the bizarro show today.  I feel terrific.  You do?  Yeah.  Was George a little, what was it like behind the scenes with George?  Fuck that fat fuck.  Oh.  Kenny.  He seems like a nice guy.  No, fat guys are usually jolly, rotund.  Right.  You know, he came in.  He probably doesn't like talking about shit. 
[02:19:30]  Personally, I love talking about shit.  I thought he kind of went with that.  I thought.  He didn't think he was on the air.  Oh, that's why?  For a million people to hear.  Well, we're supposed to explain we're on the air.  There's an on-air light on.  We have headphones.  We got microphones in front of us.  How would he?  He's yesterday's news.  Let's talk about Opie and Anthony blind gossip items.  All right.  Ian Halpern does this.  By the way, Ian Halpern gave us the scoop on Matt Lauer, but didn't mention him by name 
[02:20:00]  when he said TV host having an affair.  And Matt Lauer is denying that that is the case.  But that's the guy that Ian Halpern was talking about in one of those blind items a couple weeks ago.  Yes.  But Lauer's saying, no fucking way.  It's just not true.  But we got our own blind items with Club Soda Kenny.  Go ahead, Kenny.  Yeah.  What's the music?  Do we need dramatic music for everything?  I kind of do. 
[02:20:30]  But you don't know.  How about a dance song?  Because you like the strobe.  Show tunes, anything.  No, what dance song would you like for your blind item?  Danny?  Yeah, how about one of those faggoty disco songs that Kenny listens to?  Oh.  Oh, Kenny.  See what Danny just did there?  I know.  That was a shot.  It's all right.  It's okay.  It's par for the course for Mr. Negative Energy.  Oh.  I'm negative energy when this guy's falling asleep on the couch.  I'm negative energy. 
[02:21:00]  That's nice.  Oh.  Very funny.  Sleeping has nothing to do with being, you know, a negative Nancy.  It's no big surprise you don't like me.  Say whatever you're going to say.  Oh.  You keep insisting that.  You think Kenny doesn't like you, Danny?  I know Kenny doesn't like me.  How do you know?  The way that you've treated me over the last four years.  How is that?  Kenny, why don't you do your little bit?  Oh, no, no, no.  Let's do this bit.  Let's do blind items.  No, people love this nonsense. 
[02:21:30]  Explain to me how and why I don't like it.  You brought it up.  That's a fair question.  Let's see.  You know, I'm not allowed to get breakfast, my order in here anymore.  So I have to actually leave the room.  Kenny has instructed interns to not come in here and get anything for me or bring me anything in here.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  Okay.  Incorrect.  Well, gee, point, counterpoint there.  Well, what's, what's, Kenny, what's, what's Danny's thinking something? 
[02:22:00]  What's the?  He, he, he's blaming me for something I shouldn't have the blame for, right?  It was brought to the executive producer's attention that it was distracting for interns to come in and for you to order breakfast.  So why I get the blame for that is beyond me.  There's so many things that I, like, I should have kept the list because now they just, they're in one ear and out the other.  There's so many things.  Okay, well, your first one was incorrect.  What's your next one? 
[02:22:30]  Kenny, just do it.  There's so many.  Do whatever you're doing, Kenny.  No, there's so many.  You know what?  I'll give you five minutes to think.  Thanks, Ken.  Are you mad now?  You took your headphones off?  No, I'm not.  Go ahead.  Oh, my goodness.  You brought it up.  You brought up.  How am I Mr. Negative Energy if we're going to start, if we're going to come up with lists of things to talk about?  Go ahead.  No, the ball's in your court.  No, I want to know because that's what was brought up first. 
[02:23:00]  So how am I Mr. Negative Energy then?  You said, I don't like you, and I'm waiting for the reasons to justify your statement.  Well, where did your statement come from?  Where was that?  Where did you pull that on?  Ask anybody on the staff.  No, ask you.  Because you don't like me, so I'm Mr. Negative Energy to you.  You mean nothing to me.  It's not that I don't like you.  You mean nothing to me.  Okay.  All right?  But the thing is, take a poll.  All right?  If Danny doesn't do it, Danny doesn't like it and thinks it's a shit idea. 
[02:23:30]  That's not true at all.  Take a poll.  Where should I take it?  With the staff.  That's where you should take it.  Okay.  All right?  But I'm still waiting for you to justify why you think I don't like you.  Because one time they were talking about you, and I piled on just to be funny.  And you go, oh, I never knew Kenny didn't like me. 
[02:24:00]  I was just piling on to be funny.  We used to joke around at CBS all the time, and it was always Sam time, and there was never  any friendliness with me, so I just let it go.  It's obvious, Kenny.  It's obvious.  Said the blind man.  If it's so obvious, how come you can't justify anything?  Okay.  Wait, do you have your own poll?  No, I don't. 
[02:24:30]  You said how?  How about we take a poll?  Who's supposed to talk to you?  George went back in here.  So there's no problem between you and him?  No, look, look.  Does it bother me he doesn't say hello to me every day?  No.  No.  A lot of people despise me. 
[02:25:00]  It's okay.  It's all right.  He thinks I don't like him.  That's fine.  He tells people he thinks I don't like him.  I know he tells people.  But it's fine.  I don't think anything of him not to dislike him.  Danny, how come you think Kenny doesn't like you, though?  That's a fair question.  I mean, just the way that I've interacted with Kenny over the last five years that I've known  the guy, that's the impression that I get.  That's the impression that I get.  No. 
[02:25:30]  I've had one bad interaction with you that I can remember, which you can blame on alcohol.  What happened?  He was sneaking people backstage at a traveling fire show.  First of all, that's not true.  First of all, that's not true right off the bat.  So if you want to talk about truths and non-truths, that's not true.  There was no alcohol involved, first of all.  Second of all, if you really want to get into this, there was no sneaking at all.  The pass was an escort pass.  I had some friends at the show. 
[02:26:00]  They said, hey, I wasn't bringing a thousand people backstage.  I was escorting a couple of friends of mine and then escorting them out, and it was to  my knowledge that that was okay.  And then I got dragged aside by Kenny, who screamed in my face, and that was the end of  it.  And since that day, I don't think me and Kenny have ever gotten along on anything.  That was it?  Before that, it was nice?  That's not even worthy of me to debate about him.  Why?  Because he knows he was drinking that day. 
[02:26:30]  Wow, Kenny, really?  Yeah.  You weren't?  Maybe I had a beer or two, but you'd make it sound like I was some fall-down drunk, just  going, ah, all my friends could come back and party.  It was nothing remotely close to that.  All right.  Yeah, all right.  Who are you trying to convince, me or you, or the radio listeners?  Kenny, I'm just telling you what happened.  I don't give a fuck what you think.  I'm telling you how it happened.  I'm wrong.  You're right.  Excuse me.  Dude, I'm just telling you.  I don't give a fuck what you think.  I'm just telling you.  That's how it went down. 
[02:27:00]  I remember it quite clearly.  Of course you do.  And that's how it was.  That's why you didn't bring it up, because you remember it so clearly.  When you said there were so many reasons.  What's next?  Your bid, apparently.  See?  He just wants to change the subject.  Would that be negative?  No, he just, you know, he doesn't want to talk about it.  Well, maybe, because Danny's saying he wasn't bringing people back that were, so what made  you think that he was bringing back people that weren't supposed to be back there? 
[02:27:30]  Because I honestly don't remember.  Because I was standing right next to him when he was whispering to all his friends, bringing  him through the stage door.  He didn't even realize I was there.  Dude, what are you even talking about?  How many of my friends were backstage at one time?  That I don't know.  One.  Because I was told that you could, with the pass or whatever it was, it was explained  to me that you could escort somebody back there.  That's how it was explained to me.  I wasn't leaving a group of people back there. 
[02:28:00]  I would escort them in, and I would escort them out.  And then for some reason, all of a sudden, it was a problem, and then it didn't happen  again.  It was a problem because you were wrong, and you were spoken to about it.  That was a show.  It wasn't a free-for-all party backstage.  I understand, and I don't feel that it was a free-for-all.  I felt that, given the parameters that were in place, I didn't feel like I was doing  anything wrong.  When you had alerted me to the fact that it was not appropriate, I stopped.  But I felt that in the way, well, that's fine, and you could run your security however 
[02:28:30]  you'd like, and that's fine, and I respect that, and I did respect that.  I felt that maybe the reaction was a little over the top, but your view, your recollection  of the account is nowhere close to what actually happened.  Sorry.  Okay, sorry.  And this is where it all went wrong?  I wasn't drinking that day.  Excellent, Ken.  What's that, GH?  That's where it all went wrong?  No, I forgive and I forget. 
[02:29:00]  But before that incident, you guys got along?  Yeah, I always got along with the guy.  Was that when it all went wrong?  After that day?  I don't know.  I've tried, like I said, I've tried to be very nice to Kenny, and I've always been met  with indifference.  How do you try?  By not saying hello to me every day?  Is that how you try?  When should I say hello to you, Kenny?  When I'm in the office prepping for the show?  When should I say hi to you?  No, like when you walk down the hallway.  Travis, do I say hi to you when I come in in the morning?  No, we're all very quiet in the morning.  Do I say hi to D-Boy or Sam? 
[02:29:30]  Sam, do I say hello to you when I come in in the morning?  I think you guys should be saying hi to each other.  I'll be...  I will...  You see each other every day.  Just that...  I'm not a big good morning guy.  I don't say good...  I don't say good morning to the security guards.  I just...  I'm not a...  I'm not one of these cheery good morning guys.  And I yell a big hi, even though you guys got headphones on, hoping you're here, just  to...  Just to, you know, start the day off nice and a little high.  You guys really don't say hi to each other?  Yeah.  Maybe people won't think you're so negative if you give everybody a big hearty hello. 
[02:30:00]  I'll have to try it, Ken.  Because I need to...  I need to make sure that I make you happy during the day.  No, not me.  I'm sorry that you think that I'm Mr. Negativity, but I don't know.  You're allowed to have your opinion of me.  I'm allowed to have my opinion of you.  I don't understand why this is even on the air.  Exactly, but you got to back it up.  What do you guys used to do?  Joke and stuff?  That's the thing.  I would try to joke with Kenny.  And Kenny just...  He would have no...  From day one, you guys didn't get along? 
[02:30:30]  No, him and Sam will have...  Back at CBS, because that's back when I was in the back office where it was a little  more social.  Right, right.  And, you know, you try to have your fun, and...  Are you jealous that these two get along?  Oh, not at all.  No, I could give a fuck.  Kenny?  What?  What was the question?  Do you like Sam better?  Is that the problem?  No, Sam's a little prick I don't trust as far as I control him.  But you get along with him.  Yeah.  So it's not that.  He doesn't trust Sam.  It's not that at all.  It's just that it was blatantly obvious that, like, you know, if Sam threw something 
[02:31:00]  out there, Kenny would run with it.  And then if I tried the same gag, it was just like, you know, he'd look up from the computer  screen, and like, that was it.  So I'm like, all right, I guess I'm not joking with Kenny.  Is that true, Kenny?  I can't recall.  Your brain's too small.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have that ability?  Yeah.  Jimmy?  So I have to back up stuff, but he doesn't have to.  Okay.  I can't recall.  What is this all about?  Yeah, we work in very close quarters here.  I mean, we're around each other a lot.  I think it's weird that even people that get along don't say hi in the morning. 
[02:31:30]  I understand why you two aren't saying hi, but you obviously get along with Travis and  Derek and Sam, right?  I get along with everybody.  All right.  So, but why don't you guys say hi to start the day?  That's weird to me.  It's early and we're just not.  Even if none of us are that guy.  You're being cordial is overrated.  Really?  Even if I'm in a bad mood, I'll at least give a nod like, hey, what's up?  We're about to do radio together here.  You do say hi to Steve, to your credit.  Yeah, you know, Steve.  I hear you.  I even give him a hi. 
[02:32:00]  That's just, you know, when we get in, it's early.  We just want to sit down and get our shit done.  I really think that's weird, but I mean, that's just me.  Not saying you guys should have a, hey, what's going on?  How are you feeling?  Blah, blah, blah.  We typically don't say goodbye either.  We're in, we're out.  I say hello to you every morning.  I got nothing else to talk about because I'm not that bright.  I'm not a good conversationalist.  Tomorrow, can you make sure my seat is clear, by the way?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I had a little lapse in judgment.  And you sat on something that maybe I shouldn't be sitting on. 
[02:32:30]  In Kenny's car.  And it made the doorman very uncomfortable this morning when he saw what I sat on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's not about that right now.  So how are we going to solve this?  So, Kenny, what do you think?  Maybe this is a good thing.  Maybe Danny and Kenny could solve their differences.  Kenny, what do you need from Danny?  Nothing.  We could just be cordial and work together and be nice.  Kenny, I'm cordial with you.  I don't think that I've ever been uncordial with you. 
[02:33:00]  But when you come in here and, you know, you make a comment, I'm going to make a comment back.  Because I didn't bring it.  I didn't start this.  I didn't start any of this stuff.  You had a comment to make.  So you made your comment.  Okay.  What was the point?  What was the comment?  The point is, is that I didn't start this.  You brought it up.  So have fun with that.  About being negative?  It started with Danny poking fun at Kenny's musical taste.  And then Kenny responded by calling him negative.  Because I can't joke. 
[02:33:30]  Everybody could joke except for me.  Because then it's me.  It's personal.  Well, now we can't do Kenny's bit because you kind of just said, well, do your bit.  Which makes it awkward for everybody.  Because now.  Oh, yeah.  Now we can't do Kenny's bit.  Were you offended when Danny said that?  Did you think he was kind of taking a shot at you?  Which part?  Not offended.  But did you think he was taking a shot at you?  The music.  Because Kenny responded with something that was kind of like, you know.  Oh, yeah.  And I'll tell you something, Kenny.  It wasn't smashing you.  But it is a known fact.  Like when you did your DJ thing, it was the disco songs.  And no one really expected you, the big, you know, Malouk Kenny, to listen to 70s disco music. 
[02:34:00]  And it was a goof.  And then you responded with something that was really real.  All right.  Then I apologize.  I didn't mean it.  You see.  Of course.  I love it.  This is.  Yeah.  I just love it.  So I should say good morning to Kenny.  All right.  No, you should start by saying good morning to the people you do like around here.  That would be a start.  So you don't think Kenny's apology was sincere?  That's a good question, Jimmy.  Oh, is this a real question?  Yeah.  I thought we were just joking. 
[02:34:30]  No, I don't think so.  Of course we're joking.  Kenny?  No, I always take the high road and do the right thing.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  So you and Danny seem good now.  Yeah.  What will happen tomorrow?  Tomorrow's another day.  But what will happen?  You think there'll be a high or something?  Maybe this breaks the ice and gets you two back together.  Does it sound like you guys had fun before the big incident?  Time to the virus show.  I will tell, G-H.  And that's when it went wrong for good? 
[02:35:00]  What?  The virus show?  I don't know.  I told you, man.  I don't think Kenny...  I could recall some other things that was like real early on.  Well, what?  Sam?  Like what?  Let's get it out.  We're not going back to this anytime soon.  We'll actually have a radio show to do tomorrow.  Let's see.  I remember there was one time I called Kenny because Zig...  You know, you guys know Ziggy.  Ziggy.  I mean, for the radio fans out there, it's a long story.  But anyway, he called me for some virus tickets.  And, you know, I'm not the guy who divvies out tickets. 
[02:35:30]  So I said, well, let me go through the proper channels and let me talk to Club Soda.  I'm not going to promise you anything until I talk to Kenny.  So I called Kenny and I said, hey, you know, Zig is looking for a couple of tickets.  He said, how many?  And I think it was...  I think it was...  I mean, it wasn't a lot, but it was more than the normal plus one.  I think it might have been like plus three or four.  And all Kenny really had to say was, oh, you know, that's a lot of tickets for one person.  I'll tell you what I'll give you.  And then whatever Kenny thought would be acceptable.  But instead of taking that approach, Kenny just decided to say, well, if he thinks that that's appropriate, then I guess that it is. 
[02:36:00]  And like I went back and forth like four or five times until I just gave...  I was like, Kenny, look, can he have the tickets or not?  You know, like I'm not trying to be a dick.  I'm just asking for a friend.  And then you're coming back to me with snarkiness.  And I'm just trying to ask a favor for a friend.  Either the answer is yes or the answer is no.  That wasn't a good answer, what I said?  No, I didn't feel so.  I didn't feel that it was.  What?  Because I wasn't going to say no to the guy.  Yeah, but you're also coming across putting it in my court, making it a judgment call for me to decide whether or not that his request is valid or not. 
[02:36:30]  And I'm just...  It's not my business to make that call.  You tell me.  You're the ticket guy.  I went through the proper channels.  I said I have to go to Kenny.  So you're the man to ask about stuff like this.  So either you approve or you disapprove.  There's no middle ground.  Either you say yes or you say no.  I don't fucking need to sit on the phone for 20 minutes playing games about two tickets.  I could give a fuck.  Either it's yeah or it's no. 
[02:37:00]  It wasn't two tickets.  You said it wasn't two tickets.  I said it was above and beyond the norm of one plus one.  So let's call it one plus three.  Right.  So if you felt that it was an inappropriate request, that's all you have to say.  I don't have to sit on the phone and play little games with you.  You just say, no, I don't think that's an appropriate thing.  He could have this and this, and that's that.  Well, if I thought that, that's what I would have said.  I said what I thought.  It's like pulling teeth.  Why is it like pulling teeth?  Well, anyway, that's, I think, that's one of the first Kenny things. 
[02:37:30]  I still don't know why you guys don't like each other after 20 minutes of this, half hour of this.  I really don't.  It's just vibes, man.  You want Kenny to pay attention to you?  What's that?  I don't know.  Do you want Kenny to pay attention to you?  I don't really understand why.  I feel the same way as Kenny, where he doesn't give a fuck if I exist or not.  I'm pretty much the same way with him.  I mean, if he's here or not, I can call us.  But then why are we talking about this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Jimmy?  Well, you guys obviously both have certain feelings on it.  I mean, you know, it's like they both are not completely indifferent. 
[02:38:00]  We work in two closer quarters to be totally indifferent because literally 20 hours a week we're together.  I'm starting to think there's a man crush.  25 hours a week.  And Kenny might have his man crush on Sam and not Danny's.  It has nothing to do with that.  I mean, I just come in.  I mean, I know.  But I'm saying, I come in, I do the stuff that is a science of me to do, and I don't feel that one of my show duties is being super nice and friendly with Kenny.  I don't give a fuck.  Kenny, do you want Danny to be super nice to you?  Oh, not super nice. 
[02:38:30]  He can be the same way he continues to be.  What's that?  Ignores me.  It's up to him.  Sam?  I think Danny and Kenny both feel that they are owed a certain amount of respect from the other.  Not above and beyond what anybody else gets, but Kenny feels he should have X amount of respect from Danny, and Danny feels he should have X amount of respect from Kenny, and neither.  Why don't you shut up?  You're so wrong.  I'm not.  I got a big head. 
[02:39:00]  I got to walk around here demanding respect.  I get no respect.  I think I'm the big O for the show.  Right.  That's your line.  You say these things, but I think that you feel you're owed a certain respect from staff members, and Danny feels that he is owed the same respect, and neither of you two think you're getting it.  That's not true at all.  Actually, that's not true.  Ha ha.  We both disagree.  I don't care if Kenny respects me or not.  It's just that I have a problem with Kenny when it almost seems like he goes out of his way to make sure I don't like him. 
[02:39:30]  Is that weird?  But you don't care if he exists.  You can't have both those things.  Well, you call me Mr. Negativity.  That's number one.  And I've heard that from another.  I didn't go out of my way for that.  I was already here.  I heard that from another source that had used that exact phrase, so I kind of know where it's coming from.  All right?  Who?  Kenny.  You obviously – you've said something to other people about it, so that's fine.  I would appreciate it if you could come to me if you feel that way.  I'm sorry that you actually had to go elsewhere to get your point across about how you felt. 
[02:40:00]  That's fine.  Whatever.  It's a two-way street.  You didn't come to me and say –  What do I have to come to you with?  What do I have to come to you with?  Why don't you like me?  I don't care.  That's not something that I care about.  If you don't care so much, then what are you caring about?  I don't care.  I don't care.  So there's a negativity in the air?  Kenny seems to think so.  Everybody, they can come to their own conclusions.  But you're saying – 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Like Danny said, everybody's entitled to their opinion.  That's all.  Maybe it's me.  In the end, maybe it's just you.  Yeah.  Now we can't do your bit because he called a do your little bit, which makes –  No, we have to do it.  There's good stuff here.  I would like to do it on the –  We have a guest waiting as well.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Then you're going to keep it positive while he does his little bit?  Of course.  Yeah?  What if it doesn't go well?  Well, then it'll speak for itself. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, it's not going to go well.  It's not supposed to go well.  Oh, my God.  The bit – that's the bit to not go well.  That's your bits, right?  Yeah.  They're not supposed to go well.  Yeah.  That's an easy place to be.  That's the beauty of me.  See, I hope my bits go well.  Maybe I'm looking at this wrong.  No, no expectations.  It's the best way to go, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So how do we get into this awkward bit? 
[02:41:30]  I just start.  How long was the bit?  Quick.  Okay.  And then we'll get Mike Baker in here?  Yeah, we got it.  Mike's in.  All right.  Maybe some music should start there.  Yeah, but that's where this whole thing started.  Yeah.  Because Danny said something about – what was it?  Faggy dance?  Disco music.  Was it faggy in there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Faggity.  Faggity.  Faggity disco music.  So why would you bring the music thing up, Sam?  Just to start everything.  I don't – I mean, just to start the bit, I guess.  Who do you think is less cordial to each other? 
[02:42:00]  For real.  Yeah, Sam doesn't hold back.  What's going on here?  I think that – I think what I said about the respect thing is more accurate than they're  letting on because I think that they're – neither one of them are cordial to each  other.  They both, I think, make it so that they don't care that the other one knows that –  There's a lot of caring going on here, though.  I'm not going to beat it, Dan.  For two people that are saying they don't care.  Right.  Kenny doesn't like it when people disrespect him or don't like him.  Yeah, I know when to cut my losses.  And Danny doesn't like that Kenny doesn't like him. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I'm still going because there's a show.  Is this interesting to anybody?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, man, we officially said this is a bizarre show, so when you make it official, then you  just go with all the weirdness and you try not to bring it back on track.  Anybody who doesn't like conflict is no friend of mine.  Yeah.  In the end, I blame Anthony for calling in sick last minute.  We'll blame him tomorrow. 
[02:43:00]  And George went.  And George went and his stupid beer and his dumb hangover, I think.  All right, Kenny, now the awkward bit that everyone's been waiting for, including Danny.  Hit the disco music.  What disco song do you want?  That might bring everyone back together.  A nice, happy disco song.  Faggity disco song.  Yes, I'm very faggity.  I don't know.  What about Sister Sledge?  I wonder why I'm the greatest dancer.  Travis, do you have that?  And Danny did not roll his eyes, so that's good. 
[02:43:30]  He's going with this.  It's up to him.  I apologize, Kenny.  I don't have that.  But don't they play that on the strobe?  Maybe it's called something else.  They're so cozy when you need them.  What did you say the song's called?  Maybe that's not the name of it.  It's the band of Sister Sledge.  Right.  I don't know the name.  It's like I wonder why it's the greatest dancer.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe.  We are family.  You want We Are Family?  Yeah, okay.  Okay.  Well, that's what it's called.  All right.  All right, here we go. 
[02:44:00]  I'm not smart.  All right.  This is Blind Items with Club Soda Kenny.  Get into it.  Kenny's little bit.  Which O&A producer coincidentally took a sick day the same day as Nicole Biggums of the  morning mashup?  Really?  This is a blind item?  Juicy.  I know Sam was out Friday.  Friday.  Sam had a sick day.  I'm not a producer. 
[02:44:30]  I was out Friday.  Are we looking at Sam?  Sam and Nicole Biggums are hooking up?  Oh.  No.  You didn't hear from me.  You didn't hear from me.  Why?  She was out and Sam was out.  Oh, coincidentally, they both had sick days.  Hey, good for you, Sam.  I guess she was sick.  I was not in.  We didn't even speak to each other that day.  All right.  If that's what you say, if that's the story you're sticking to.  Yeah.  We have another blind item?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, this little bit's continuing, huh?  Yeah.  Now you're mad at Kenny, too?  Yeah.  By the end of this, I think we're all going to be mad at you, Kenny.  Fine.  Jimmy, are you mad at Kenny yet?  I'm not, actually.  No, you're good with him?  No.  He will be after this one.  Go ahead.  Which O&A show member will be in Seattle on Friday, May 28th?  Danny's not laughing, though.  Danny, you could have laughed at that.  He's giving you a shit-eating grin right now.  See, this isn't supposed to be good. 
[02:45:30]  Right, Kenny?  That's what you said?  I'm confused.  I thought it wasn't supposed to go good.  Is it going good?  I don't know.  It's not for me to decide.  It's up to the fans.  Yeah, he didn't think of it, so it's no good.  Oh.  See, why do you got to be Mr. Negativity, Kenny?  Wait, what does that mean, Kenny?  Sam, do you know what that means?  I'm really confused.  Kenny's implying that Danny doesn't appreciate bits that Danny is not involved in. 
[02:46:00]  Danny?  I don't have to like this bit.  That's my opinion.  But at the same time, that isn't true.  Do you like bits that other people don't?  Bits are fine.  Name one bit that you weren't part of that you liked.  Just to prove that Kenny's wrong.  All right, what kind of bit?  What are we talking about?  No, Sam is saying, like Kenny's saying.  Cherry darts is fun.  I didn't invent cherry darts.  That's a fun bit.  But you, I mean, you were involved in it.  Why, because I showed up? 
[02:46:30]  I mean, you organized.  Someone had a show on Friday.  Well, because people emailed an email address that I was checking.  How am I involved with cherry darts?  You organized it, and you played.  I don't see how you followed.  We are family.  All right, all right.  Next blind item from Kenny.  We got Mike Baker standing by.  Yeah, by Polly's.  Which ONA intern left a bar in a huff after Bobo called him a red-headed faggot? 
[02:47:00]  I don't know the intern's names.  The one that looks like Bozo, Dustin.  Thanks, Dustin.  Is that really what happened?  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  Bobo said what?  Called him a red-headed faggot.  The interns went out drinking, and Love Buzz was coaxing Bobo to speak badly of Dustin.  This was after cherry darts?  Yes.  Okay.  Danny threw his mic away.  He's not liking this.  No, I just.  It was in my way.  I put it to the side. 
[02:47:30]  And I saved the best for last.  All right.  Which ONA show member is celebrating a birthday next week and wants everybody to give him lots of presents?  Ooh.  Ooh.  I got a birthday coming up Sunday.  Pingo!  We have a winner!  And it's not the listener.  I was imitating Voss.  Yeah, because Voss says Pingo.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  I don't mind presents.  Yeah, no.  I think the listeners should show their appreciation and send you a lot of gifts.  What's the address?  It's Sirius XM Radio, 1221 Avenue of the Americas.  Attention, Greg Opie Hughes, New York, New York, 10020.  Is that it, Kenny?  That's it. 
[02:48:30]  That's my contribution.  Danny, was that good?  It was excellent.  I thought it went very well.  Thank you, Daniel.  I accomplished what I needed to do.  What was that?  Kill time.  That's all we're doing today.  Let's get Mike in here.  He's been waiting 45 minutes.  We can't Mike wait.  I've got to take a leak.  I'll talk to him.  He can just come in.  All right.  Mike Baker is entering the studio.  He does Red Eye with Jimmy.  He served 14 years with the CIA.  Mike, how are you?  Sorry for the wait, Mike.  17 years with the CIA? 
[02:49:00]  17 years.  Sorry.  It says 14.  Why would our one sheet be right?  You know, that George thing went really well.  Oh, you heard that?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That was good.  Really?  I was in the other room trying to slash my wrists.  Oh, you were here for that?  No, I caught the tail end.  Oh.  I caught the tail end.  And then the post wrap-up, which was very entertaining.  We just didn't know what to do with the guy.  Like, he came in here sluggish, and like, he didn't want to be here, and he's got a  book about beer, so we're talking about beer with the guy.  We didn't know what to do.  Beer seems like the logical place to go. 
[02:49:30]  Hey, George went.  I mean, that's what I would have done.  Well, we tried to go other places.  Like, I don't know.  Well, you're a guy who's interrogated people, like, for real, right?  Like, I'm sure you've been in those rooms.  I mean, you could have tried beating the shit out of them, but, you know, I don't.  I mean, it would have made it possibly more entertaining.  We've gotten some information.  I'm the guy that usually beats the shit out of them, but I usually don't like beating  the shit out of guys that don't deserve it.  Like, he didn't deserve to be beat up.  We were a little frustrated by him, but, you know.  Well, they showed me a couple of stills.  He just looked tired.  He looked, you know, he looked like he was dragging, you know, as opposed to us. 
[02:50:00]  We look very perky.  How do you get a guy like that to open up?  You know what?  You know, actually, that's a really good question.  We could spend all day talking about interrogation.  I'm sure that the listeners would love to do that, but there's a lot that goes into, I mean,  if you sit down with a suspect, for instance, whether it's law enforcement or whether it's  intelligence, hopefully you walk into that room with a lot of information in your back  pocket, right?  I mean, you never want to go into an interrogation or a debriefing without some understanding 
[02:50:30]  as to where you want it to go, but then you've got to start making a lot of very quick  split-second decisions, you know, and that takes some skill and being able to read what  that person is thinking and what they're doing, what their motivations are, what their  agenda is.  You look at everything from their body language to, you know, just the way that they deliver  a response.  And, you know, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but your best, you know, I'm sure  it's probably the same thing in radio.  Your best, you know, offense is good homework.  I bow to guys like you because why answer any questions? 
[02:51:00]  That's all you have to do is not answer anything.  Yeah.  While you're in that room.  Well, I tell you what, now people know that.  That's why it takes a skill to freaking get these guys to open up.  Yeah.  I mean, I hate to say this.  I don't want to go off and on a ramp, but I mean, now, yeah, now Al Qaeda knows that.  They understand that we're not going to take them in the back room and beat the shit out  of them because they've seen everything that we can do because the administration's released  everything that we can do.  You know, they released all those DOJ memos and it literally, it spells out, this is what  we're able to do.  Now, mind you, the agency, the CIA spent a long time trying to get certain procedures cleared 
[02:51:30]  and they were very careful.  They keep going back and forth with Washington saying, can we do this?  Can we not do that?  You know, and then Congress, as they always do, they always play this game.  They always act surprised.  Oh, we didn't know you were doing this.  Well, bullshit.  There's a huge file.  Yeah, of course they do.  With Pelosi, do you think Pelosi was bullshitting when she was implying that she hadn't been  briefed about what was going on with waterboarding?  There's a game that gets played and it gets played with the intelligence committees and  other members of Congress where it's, you know, plausible deniability. 
[02:52:00]  You know, the understanding is, you know, we're going to go out as an agency, as a CIA,  to do certain things that have been approved.  If there's blowback, if it gets discovered, you know, fuck it.  The people up on the hill are going to go, we don't know.  We're outraged.  Oh my God, how shocked are we?  And it's going to, you know, it's going to come back on us.  But that's understood.  Right.  No big deal.  Right, right, right.  Did you guys feel like, it seemed to me like the CIA was kind of thrown to the wolves a  little bit during this waterboarding stuff.  It's almost like, like he said, everybody just kind of ran for cover.  Well, we didn't know what was going on.  And there weren't guys like, you know, being put on trial. 
[02:52:30]  They really kind of douched the CIA at this list.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, the CIA is the best scapegoat on the planet.  I mean, I don't want to, you know, and I love the outfit.  It's a great organization, wonderful people.  So naturally people are going to say, well, of course he's going to say all this shit.  But, you know, frankly, the agency over the decades has always been the best scapegoat  in Washington.  Anytime something goes wrong, because why?  Because the CIA won't defend itself because it can't.  You know, they're protecting sources and methods.  They're protecting secrets.  They're protecting identities.  So, you know, their inclination is not to be political, which always surprises people. 
[02:53:00]  It's a very apolitical organization.  And they're not going to go out there and say, well, screw you.  This is what happened.  They can't.  So, you know, Congress knows that.  And they know it's a cheap shot to take a swing at the agency because they're not going  to fight back.  They're just going to turn the other cheek and say, OK, fine, we'll march on.  Give us another task to do.  We'll go out and do that with the understanding that at some point you may toss us under the  bus again.  Yeah, they really are.  When you think CIA, it's such a secretive thing.  There's a lot of intrigue with it, but it's something that everybody knows about. 
[02:53:30]  And yet we all feel like we know nothing about.  Like when you're when you're what are you doing right before you go in the CIA?  Like what's the next step?  Like, OK, I'm next.  I'm going to be a CIA agent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where are you before that?  Yeah.  Before that, you know, I thought I was going to go into journalism.  Actually, I'd gone to I got to school, gotten a journalism degree.  And and and that's that's done me a whole lot of good.  And and then I started doing some some some some work.  I don't want to be too coy, but I eventually I ended up in the agency and it was a circuitous 
[02:54:00]  route and I didn't set my mind to it.  A lot of people do now, particularly after 9-11.  I mean, the number of potential recruits that we get has tripled probably more than that  since prior to 9-11 when we had a hard time filling slots and getting enough people in  there because we have a high washout rate.  You put people through this training program and some people get in there and say, screw  it.  It's not for me.  Some people, you know, just can't cut it, whatever it is, a very high attrition rate  through the training.  And so getting enough people prior to 9-11 to fill the slots we needed was very difficult. 
[02:54:30]  And they talk about this all the time.  They say, well, my God, you know, how did 9-11 happen?  You know, well, I'll tell you, 9-11 happened because we kept getting our budget cut at the  CIA and we didn't have the the the people coming through the system to staff up the the the  the the case officer slots.  So we were lacking in human intelligence naturally.  And the focus had been for a while on technology.  You know, get the satellites up in the air.  That'll that'll answer all our questions.  How much did you know before 9-11? 
[02:55:00]  Like there was there was intel out there.  There was intel out there.  You know what?  There wasn't there wasn't an understanding as to how serious bin Laden was.  I mean, we knew about bin Laden for years.  Right.  And to some degree, we're tracking what he was doing.  We were tracking his associates and there was a period of time when, yeah, we could have  we could have whacked him.  There's no doubt about it.  But, you know, hey, great hindsight.  You know, there was no collective understanding as to how dangerous he was and what the intent  was.  I mean, clearly, if there was, you know, we would have we would have taken care of him. 
[02:55:30]  Didn't they didn't they back off on killing him for like I think it was during the Clinton  administration.  There was a shot where they could kill bin Laden where they they they they they fired missiles  in response to something, whether it was an embassy bombing and it was like an empty  training camp camp that wasn't being used.  He could have been killed.  But for political reasons, the government didn't sign off on it.  Yeah.  I mean, there were there were a handful of times when it came up that, you know, maybe  that was a solution.  But again, the political blowback, the concern being obviously that, you know, once again, 
[02:56:00]  you know, do we have justification to do this to do a hit?  Yeah, to do a hit.  And can we take the blowback from whatever host country he was in?  And for quite a while he was he was over in the Sudan and hanging out there.  Well, we knew that we knew exactly where he was.  We know the compound he was in.  And, you know, it was you know, there was opportunity.  But again, without that collective understanding, you know, you can't take the next step.  So I don't necessarily fault the Clinton administration or any administration. 
[02:56:30]  I mean, you've got to have some level of of agreement before you take an action like that.  But yeah, looking back in hindsight, we should have whacked him while we were out there.  But leading up to 9-11, I mean, what was out there that you could talk about?  Well, I mean, think about what happened before 9-11.  You know, the Beirut bombing, you know, the coal, you had the African embassy bombing.  So we had a long history.  They didn't need Iraq and Afghanistan to hate us.  I mean, they're going to hate us regardless of what we do.  But we can we can do everything possible, as the current administration is trying to do to deny the fact that Muslim extremists are out there trying to kill us. 
[02:57:00]  They're still going to want to kill us.  But there was a whole series of attacks that took place.  And because of that, I mean, we spent a great deal of time in counterterrorism well before 9-11, gathering information about what al-Qaeda meant, what it was, who the people were involved, and disrupting quite a number of operations and also tracking down and taking care of the people involved.  You guys don't get credit for all the ones you make sure don't happen, unfortunately.  No, I mean, and that's, you know, that's the way it works. 
[02:57:30]  You know, I mean.  I'm sure there were some biggies, but, you know, people were like, ah, but it didn't happen.  So, you know.  You hear about a couple of arrests.  A house was raided.  Right.  But what's going to happen didn't happen.  And that what could have happened was a biggie.  And then these guys are at the bar or wherever going, holy crap, can you believe we were able to, you know, take care of that one?  Yeah.  Right?  That's right.  And people will look at, like Richard Reed, the shoe bomber, and they'll go, usually what happens is when it's something like that and you don't get, you know, somebody who looks like Lex Luthor, people think, ah, fuck it, it's not a big deal. 
[02:58:00]  Well, it is a big deal because a couple of little things go right and suddenly a plane goes down or the SUV blows up in Times Square, which would completely change the mentality of America right now if that had actually worked.  But, yeah, it's no coincidence or it's not a bit of luck, well, there is some luck involved, that we haven't been attacked against since 9-11 on our soil, successfully attacked.  You know, there have been a great number of plots that have been picked up on, that have been disrupted, minimized, whatever.  A lot of people arrested.  A great deal of the leadership of al-Qaeda has been decimated, either killed or captured. 
[02:58:30]  And, you know, those are great success stories.  But you're absolutely right.  I mean people don't talk about that.  You know, either it's not interesting or you can't talk about it.  Because the CIA and FBI, there was a lot of speculation when 9-11 happened that the CIA and FBI, one of the problems was both are very territorial organizations and don't share information well.  So certain things that had they just been kind of sharing information, which no one's to blame for that.  Sometimes just systems are in place and that's the way it is.  Was that a part of the problem that, like, just nobody seemed – at that point wasn't telling each other anything? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, I mean I'll tell you.  I remember back when we started working with the other agencies.  The FBI is a good example.  The FBI went out in the early 90s.  They started sending people out overseas to work on terrorism.  Well, you can imagine.  I mean the agency, the CIA guys, you know, were overseas working counterterrorism.  We're thinking, you know, what the fuck?  You know, who are these guys?  You know, they're coming out in the field and pissing on our turf.  So, you know, we didn't play well together.  The bureau, you know, they felt the same way.  They felt they were coming in with their own ways of doing things, their methodology, and it was better.  And so, I mean, I remember at one point being called in overseas in an office out there where they said we're going to meet with some guys in the bureau. 
[02:59:30]  And we were running a big operation out there at the time.  And so I remember coming in and walking into our offices, our war room where we had all this shit up on the walls about this operation and stuff being taken down and shoved in desk drawers.  And I said, what's going on?  They said, well, the bureau guys are coming over.  So we were actively hiding all the information we had about what we were doing.  And, of course, they were doing the same thing.  They weren't telling us everything.  That was sort of the mindset, and that was a big problem that led up to allowing 9-11 to happen, the inability to share information from the state to the local to the federal authorities. 
[03:00:00]  And that's still a bit of an issue.  I mean, not a bit of an issue.  I don't want to make it simplified.  But it's still the holy grail.  If you can figure out a way to get actionable intelligence to move around through all the different organizations that need it, including the military, then, you know, hey, you've got the brass ring.  That's the big score.  What is – I guess the only way to do that would be to make them three branches of one thing and have one guy run it. 
[03:00:30]  What is the – what's the reason for it?  Is everybody wants credit when it goes right?  Or what's the reason for not sharing – because I guess on a certain level you can trust each other.  You know that he's not going to go to the paper or he knows you're not going to go to the paper.  What is the real motive?  Well, yeah.  I mean you hope so.  You pointed a good – people can't keep their yap shit anymore, right?  I mean every time you open up the page – it used to be the New York Times wouldn't write a story unless they could attribute the sources.  Now you can write a story based on five anonymous sources.  And how many times do you read something that says a senior official from an intelligence agency who doesn't want to be identified? 
[03:01:00]  Well, because he shouldn't open his fucking mouth.  Now he's talking.  But the problem is with sharing of intelligence, of actionable intelligence, part of it is the protection of your sources and methods.  If I go out and I spend all this time and I recruit an asset in some terrorist cell and he's providing me with some detail, I am really reluctant to send that out into the ether or share it in meetings where I don't know how it's going to be controlled after that amongst all these various organizations.  Even though I know these people are all on the same team, it's still a concern because – 
[03:01:30]  You don't know who to trust.  You don't know – well, you know who to trust.  You trust your team.  But it's just –  But beyond that.  Beyond that.  It's just the nature of the beast, unfortunately.  I got you.  And with that said, why is it – like the Times Square bombing happens, right?  Us just average schmucks.  Why do we know so much about what the plan was in Times Square?  How does all that info get out there?  Yeah.  Well –  How is the news and the media all over it?  I'm sure they're not getting it 100 percent correct, but there is a lot of info. 
[03:02:00]  There's a lot of it.  Yeah, there's a lot of info.  Who's talking?  If it's just the NYPD and CIA and the FBI on the scene.  Yeah.  It's – it is –  That's always bothersome to me.  It's like why don't we all just shut the fuck up until we arrest the people we need to arrest?  It's a cultural shift.  I mean I don't know what – you're like my dad was in World War II.  He didn't talk about – he just – it wasn't anything he discussed.  He didn't feel the need to talk about it when he came home.  Not that I was around when he came home.  But you know what I mean. 
[03:02:30]  Older times, you'd go there, you'd do your job, and you'd shut your mouth.  And you wouldn't talk if it was sensitive information.  I think in part because the world is a lot smaller and because you've got a lot more media outlets.  But there's something that people can't help but talk.  Now, what I don't get is you can talk about like the Times Square thing and generalities.  But if you're involved in the investigation and you start giving out specific details like we're seeing in some of the reports.  Sure.  It seems like that.  Yeah, you've got to wonder what the hell is wrong with these people.  But it is amazing. 
[03:03:00]  The Times Square issue, one of the great things about it was that obviously the SUV didn't blow up, and that gave us a great deal of information.  Then Faisal Shahzad started talking a lot, and he can't stop talking as it seems.  And so that's providing us with a great deal of information.  We pick up these other individuals.  Why is he talking so much?  You know, some people love it.  Because he's hoping that he doesn't go to – maybe he does less jail time.  Is he hoping to get something out of that obviously?  Or is he Americanized and kind of seeking now fame that he has a platform?  That's right.  He's probably thinking he's going to get a show out of this, and it could be.  It would be a hell of a show.  But, you know, I think part of it is he's Americanized, and I think he's – I think you're right. 
[03:03:30]  You know, he's grown up in a way watching everybody get on TV and have their five-minute interview.  Part of it is you never know the personality.  When someone sits down sometimes, they do really want to talk, and you've got to figure out how to get them to talk.  And also, don't forget, Shahzad didn't want to blow himself up, right?  I mean that's a different mentality.  If this was a suicide bombing, the guy probably would keep his yap shut.  But he's in there.  He's talking, which is great. 
[03:04:00]  Now we pick up these other guys because they're following the financial trail.  They're following the communications trail.  And all of this leads to – you don't know where it's going to lead.  You pick up a guy who provided some money.  Well, maybe he knows somebody else out in Pakistan or Afghanistan or wherever.  That sets you off on an entirely different investigation, gives you more opportunities.  All of these things lead someplace else.  It's very labor-intensive.  But we're gaining a lot, I guess is the way to put it, from the Times Square debacle.  Debacle.  Debacle. 
[03:04:30]  You must have a lot of frequent flyer miles.  All of a sudden, you're on a case and they're like, all right, we need you in Afghanistan tomorrow.  All right, get yourself out to Pakistan.  Yeah, you know, these guys –  A lot of that happened in your career?  You were based in Washington, obviously.  No, I never did a tour in Washington, which was great.  I spent the whole time overseas.  Can you say where?  All over.  Yeah.  Sorry, that was very specific.  Yeah, you know what we did – the agency follows the money in terms of the budget tasking from the administration. 
[03:05:00]  So when I started, it was counterinsurgency.  We were doing work in – Central America was a big theater for us.  Southeast Asia was a big area for us.  And so you're beating back communism.  I mean that's how old I am.  Right, right.  The Soviet Union still existed when I joined, which was in a unique perspective.  And it fell shortly thereafter.  How do you blend in?  How do you blend in?  Well, in a lot of these things, in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, you don't really care about blending in. 
[03:05:30]  I mean you care about identifying a target and taking care of the target.  Yeah.  You know, some of the other concerns – when you're talking about surveillance in a place overseas, yeah, then you've got to worry about blending in.  Right.  But the agency isn't quite as homogenous as people make it out to be.  I mean we've got a real mix of people in that group.  We also rely on local assets.  So I go someplace that's some fourth world shithole and I need to do surveillance.  You know, likely I've got assets in that country that I can rely on, that I can count on to get out there, get on the street, and do a lot of the surveillance work on our behalf. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  You're in one of these shithole countries and you have to go to work.  Like – you know what I mean?  Like where do you stay and where do you go?  Are you in a hotel or – like how do they keep you –  You have to go somewhere so you can do the work for that day.  Like that's weird to me.  You make believe you're a small business guy.  Maybe I'm talking –  I'm staying at the La Quinta Inn in some fourth world place.  Well, how do you not stand out like a sore thumb day?  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's a good question.  You've got to set up your shit in these countries.  Well, it depends on what you're doing.  In some places, you know, we reside or offices will reside overseas permanently for a couple of years, three years, four years, whatever at a time. 
[03:06:30]  What about those real rinky-dink places?  I mean are you making believe you're –  It depends on the requirement.  I mean you could – you know, you use whatever cover will facilitate whatever operation you're working.  So is it business?  Yeah, who knows?  Could be.  Is it tourist?  Could be.  I'm not giving any secrets away, by the way, in case anybody is listening.  And it just depends on what you need to do.  Now, you may be staying in a safe house. 
[03:07:00]  Maybe you're staying in a hotel as if you're a tourist or a businessman.  I mean it depends on the environment.  But you're right.  There are places out there where, A, we don't blend in.  B, we're not supposed to be.  And so the last thing you want is the local authorities to find out that they're doing something that would piss them off.  Well, that sucks as far as a social life goes.  There is no social life.  Although I will say – I will say I don't know how many – not a lot, but there were times when overseas working with some folks on clandestine operations, you'd find out that one of your compadres, one of your team members was banging some local. 
[03:07:30]  And you think, really?  You think that's really smart from an operational standpoint.  And some people just couldn't help themselves.  It's pussy, though.  Well, it is.  And it's foreign.  You're sitting next to one of those people.  It's foreign strange.  Jimmy would be really bad in the CIA.  Some Russian woman could suck every secret out of me.  I'm a weak man.  Jimmy would not be good in the CIA.  He would be banging the locals.  You'd be using alias documentation.  You wouldn't be under your own name. 
[03:08:00]  So nobody would know.  You'd come back and you'd be clear.  Well, let me ask you.  You've got a guy like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  There's all these questions about waterboarding.  And look, if a guy is up for bank robbery or whatever, even harsh murder, that's one thing.  But the threat of a guy – when the crimes they're committing are going to kill thousands of people and they're involved, what is the mindset in getting information out of them?  And what about waterboarding?  Because there's so much negative spin on that.  Did it help get stuff out of Mohammed?  Yeah, I mean the – I'll say this, and I don't want to sound like some sort of dogmatic asshole, but the far left grabbed the whole interrogation thing. 
[03:08:30]  And to their credit, they did a good job of taking the high ground.  From their perspective, it was either torture or talking.  There was nothing in between.  So they grabbed all that stuff in between that are legitimate, harsh interrogation techniques.  It's not pleasant, but it's not supposed to be pleasant, frankly.  But is it torture?  No.  Honestly, absolutely not. 
[03:09:00]  And we put our own people through that training.  So whether it's sleep deprivation or whether it's the waterboarding and – but they grabbed it.  And to their credit, again, boy, oh, my God.  I can't believe they're doing this.  Well, so what happened was something like KSM comes in, somebody like that comes in, and it's the threat, right?  When you go into an interrogation, what you want that detainee to be thinking is he doesn't know what the hell to be thinking, right?  It's the surprise.  It's the threat of the unknown.  It's the fear.  You want to keep them off their guard. 
[03:09:30]  Well, if they know everything that you can do, then all of that's gone.  So what happens?  You'll sit like him in a room.  You get him wherever you get him.  Say they bring him to Jordan or somewhere, wherever they bring him.  Now, he's in a room.  Is it like we think where it's a light bulb over him?  I mean what is the interrogation room like and what's the vibe like?  You know, it's actually a very labor-intensive facility.  There's a lot of control involved.  You know, people think of Abu Ghraib.  Just throw Abu Ghraib off the wall.  That was like a frat party gone wrong.  There was not enough senior management there overseeing people who didn't have enough experience in a law enforcement setting. 
[03:10:00]  That was not an interrogation facility.  That was a detention facility.  An interrogation facility is a very, very controlled environment, and there is a tremendous – most of the work is done before you walk into that room with a detainee.  And there's a huge amount of effort put into each session when you've got one of these guys.  And it can look like you described.  It can be, you know, just sort of a bare-bones room, a couple of light bulbs hanging down there. 
[03:10:30]  And it's not necessarily for the effect.  It's just, you know, what you've got in terms of resources, you know, in that particular location.  Some of them are very, you know, sort of sophisticated-looking environments.  But the point being is that you get that person in there, and if they understand – and believe me, al-Qaeda, you know, they're not made up of rocket scientists.  But at the same time, they pay attention to what the hell we're doing.  They understand what it is we're able to do.  They've read the Army field manual.  They've read through all those DOJ memos that were released by the administration.  And they understand what it is that we can and can't do now. 
[03:11:00]  So your element of surprise, the element of fear, the unknown is taken away from these guys.  Any one of us in here now is just going to sit there and keep our mouths shut.  There is no reason why you're going to feel – because you've got to know, okay, at most maybe they're going to knock me around a little bit, you know, but they can't bruise me.  You know, they can't even – you know, it is incredible.  I couldn't break my teenage daughter with what's in the Army field manual.  I guarantee you.  Wow, really?  And I've tried.  So it's – you know, it's a little bit scary. 
[03:11:30]  The Army field manual relies on a variety of things.  It relies on good cop, bad cop.  It relies on playing on their emotions.  It relies on being their friend.  You know, it is – that's great.  Does that work sometimes or no?  It can.  And you know what?  And here's the thing.  You know, the agency, the CIA got kicked around, you know, saying, oh, my God.  And it made it sound because the left grabbed the argument and the media ran with it.  It made it sound like, you know, all we did was pick people up and torture them.  All we did.  And the first thing we do is go to the harsh interrogation techniques.  Well, bullshit.  You know, the vast, vast majority of people that we picked up and that we've picked up over the years have been through this effort to try to develop a relationship with it, talk to them. 
[03:12:00]  The same thing that the Bureau has been doing.  And the Bureau, a couple of times, they didn't do us much favor.  You know, they threw us under the bus a couple of times saying, well, we talk to them and we get good information.  Well, no shit, Sherlock.  We do too.  And that's how we got most of our information.  But you will have a handful of people like KSM that – that's not going to work.  You know, and you can spend years trying to develop a relationship or try to use psychology on them and they're not going to talk. 
[03:12:30]  He's just never going to give you anything.  Not going to happen.  So you've got to have other tools in your kit, right?  And unfortunately, as I mentioned before, you know, now everybody knows what the hell is in our kit bag.  How about drugs?  I mean, you know –  No, thanks.  Oh, oh.  How about drugs like – there are drugs that weaken your defenses.  You know, that type of stuff must be employed.  No, because you know what?  I mean, if you think it's tough to get approval from Washington to engage in a very limited amount of sleep deprivation, try suggesting drugs. 
[03:13:00]  You're not even allowed to keep them awake.  Yeah, well, I mean, it was for a very short window.  You know, you could keep them awake.  Now, I can't tell you.  Even that short window can be very effective if used within a program.  But what's the problem with that?  You know what?  I mean, look, we can't even –  You make sure they have a good night's sleep before you ask them a few questions?  We're agonizing right now.  Not to get too far up there in the ether, but we're agonizing right now over whether we should yank the citizenship of Anwar al-Laki, right?  The guy who's recruiting people to come over here and kill us. 
[03:13:30]  And so that's what's wrong with it.  We've lost our balls.  They put the predator drone hit on him.  Is that the one?  And there's the big question, like, should it be put on a citizen?  Is that the guy?  Right.  I mean, there's been authorization to try to kill him.  Well, again, going back to your comment about how does the media know all this?  For God's sake, why do we have it out in the open that we've authorized an attempted hit on somebody?  That's just crazy to me.  Yeah, and now he knows it.  And now they're reacting appropriately. 
[03:14:00]  Of course.  So, but the point being that now that, you know, we can't.  How much sleep do you have to allow them to have before you allow to wake them and hopefully get something done?  Well, you know, you got to.  Is that in the manual, too?  Yeah, I mean, it's, well, the Army field manual prohibits that sort of thing.  It also prohibits temperature change, you know, and sensory deprivation.  Temperature change would be, you'd get me on that one.  Yeah.  I tell you what, you go from a hot box to a cold box.  Oh, fuck.  And then they're playing, they're playing, I'll tell you what's the worst thing is when they do the audio. 
[03:14:30]  Well, you know, and the worst thing is, was the Arabic music.  I could have listened to metal all day long.  And one time I was in for training and they did nothing but played the Barney theme song, you know.  For how long?  Oh, for hours.  It's just, I love you, you love me, you know, we're best friends like friends should be.  It will never leave my head.  I remember this song.  I'll be sitting on a train and that will pop into my head.  So, yeah, you guys have been through all this.  What was the worst one for you?  The Arabic music.  Why were they playing it?  To do what?  Well, you know, it's a combination of elements.  It's the sleep, it's the temperature, it's the audio. 
[03:15:00]  And what they're trying to do is basically disorient you.  They're trying to keep you off, you know, from sitting there.  Because if you're sitting there in silence and you're comfortable, what are you thinking about?  You're thinking about, okay, this is what I told the guy the last time.  This is what I'm going to tell him the next time.  Now, I wonder, and you're plotting strategy.  You want to keep them unbalanced, right?  But we can't do that.  My point being is that the administration now has laid all that bare.  All these people out there in Pakistan, they're fully briefed on what the hell to expect.  And without that uncertainty. 
[03:15:30]  Makes it a lot tougher.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Good luck.  But anyway.  Where do you think?  I mean, again, it's pure speculation.  But guys like al-Zawahari and bin Laden, first of all, do you think they're together?  I doubt they're together.  Or are they together?  You mean romantically?  I mean, they could be.  Bin Laden likes little boys.  That would shake.  Does it really?  You didn't hear from me.  Oh, wait a minute.  You did.  Bin Laden likes little boys?  I'm just, who knows.  I'm just, I'm not saying it.  I can't go any further than that. 
[03:16:00]  Are you funny if he sued you for that?  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Oh, my God.  It's probably going to be a fatwa on me now because I've just said that.  What do you think they are?  Are they somewhere in Pakistan, do you think?  Or have they just got everybody bamboozled and they're smart and somewhere completely different?  No.  You know what?  There is really limited opportunity for bin Laden to move around.  But you look at the size of the reward out on his head all these years.  Nobody's talking.  I mean, this guy is well protected.  And people do say, well, oh, my God, he's the tallest Arab in the world. 
[03:16:30]  How can you not find him?  Well, you know, good luck.  Well, he's also got a billion dollars, too.  He's got enough money to keep people around him comfortable with money.  And that's a good that's a very good point to raise.  He came from family money.  His father was was enormously wealthy out of construction and development in Saudi.  And, you know, so he's he's got the cash.  And that was how he originally came to to to what he does now.  I mean, he was he was a financier.  I mean, he was funding a lot of the Mujahideen effort out in Afghanistan when the Soviets were there. 
[03:17:00]  But, no, they're they're in Pakistan.  And, you know, at some point, you know, we'll either get him or he'll die of natural causes.  Will we know when he dies of natural causes?  Yeah.  Eventually, we'll probably we'll probably get word of it.  Yeah.  But, you know, it won't be immediate.  Our human intelligence is not, you know, is it's improving.  But it's always a problem when it comes to the inner circle of what's going on around bin Laden.  I think he's still alive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, I mean, you know, at the end of the day, would I rather have bin Laden?  Would I rather have an operational guy who's actually out there plotting this crap? 
[03:17:30]  I'd rather have the operational guy.  And that's what we've been doing.  We've been picking up a lot of the lieutenants and the majors, the secondary structure.  And, you know, you kill enough of these guys.  You know what?  For us, it's very symbolic to get bin Laden.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean, for you guys, it's like, yeah, it's more important that we get these guys that are planning the next attack.  But for pretty much all of America, symbolically.  We want him.  No, you're right.  I mean, that'll be a national holiday.  You're right.  You're right.  And I don't make light of getting him. 
[03:18:00]  That'll be a huge get from a morale purpose.  But from the operational side, there are people there that are calling the shots or making plans.  You know, bin Laden is sort of the high figure, the high priest of the wazoo or whatever of al-Qaeda right now.  And they look for him for perhaps a blessing on something.  But at the end of the day, this is devolved.  So you've got individual guys out there like you didn't before who are able to make decisions about doing an operation.  You've got – and it makes it more difficult for us to intercept because it's like roaches.  You've got them all in one place.  You can kill them quicker.  They scatter like this and they're all out there. 
[03:18:30]  You've got to step on more of them in more places.  They can't even get Adam Gadan.  He's the American spokesman.  You know, again, one of these alternative upbringings.  You know, him and who was the other one?  John Walker.  Yeah, John Walker.  These guys are always from the same kind of fucking shitty, hey, let him do what he wants upbringing.  And he's over in, I think, Pakistan.  And they can't get him.  It's like he's an American.  You know, he sounds like me.  And they can't get him.  I think it's from Cupertino or somewhere like that.  Yeah, from California, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, and we're seeing more of that.  We're seeing more. 
[03:19:00]  And people, that tends to worry people when you see folks like Fajal Shahzad or whatever with some level of upbringing here in the U.S.  And people are going, what the hell is going on?  Well, you've got to – it seems like a bottomless well of either undereducated, unmotivated, troubled individuals who, at the end of the day, al-Qaeda is not raising the bar.  They're not saying we've got to have a microbiologist.  We've got to have some rocket scientist to recruit.  They don't care.  They want somebody who they can manipulate. 
[03:19:30]  So, again, you look at the underwear bomber or you look at the Times Square bomber and people think, oh, well, the guy's an idiot.  Well, yeah, but that's who they're recruiting.  And that's all they need.  They don't need much, right?  I mean they just need somebody willing to carry out the plot.  And so those are the people they're looking to recruit.  There's a lot of people out there like that that fit that bill.  Jesus.  I've got to take a –  I've got to pee, too.  Take a break?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I mean to a really good interview intended with I've got to take a leak really bad is probably not that professional. 
[03:20:00]  See, now, if this was an interrogation, I wouldn't let you go take a leak.  Oh, my –  I know.  I would answer all your questions.  Would you make the person who just pee their pants?  No, you'd have to just pee their pants.  No, I don't.  We are cool.  Actually, we would not be allowed to not let you go to the bathroom.  We would have to authorize you a bathroom break.  How hot to how cold?  There are very set limits.  I don't want to go into that, but there are very set limits about temperature.  Again –  Before.  Before everything changed.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I mean.  Pretty hot to pretty cold?  You know what?  Not brutal.  It's not like you're going from the icebox to the desert, but you don't need that.  It's the change which really affects you and keeps you uncomfortable, which is, again, what you're looking to do. 
[03:20:30]  And then you go into a small enclosed space.  Then you go into a room.  You don't know what's in the room.  You get a sense that there's other people in there.  I mean because usually you're – you know, you can't really – I mean it's a very difficult process, but, again, it's a necessary process.  And I guess my point would be, yes, there's torture, and, of course, we shouldn't be torturing, not for any moral, ethical reasons.  I'm not going to get in that argument, but just for operational reasons.  You know, frankly, if you torture somebody, you're not going to get good actionable intelligence. 
[03:21:00]  But there are other steps, and they spent a long time trying to figure out what did and didn't work.  And there's a very small set of procedures, these harsh interrogation techniques that they spent all this time developing.  There's nothing new under the sun.  And so when the administration, the current administration, releases all that information, it's not like they're going to go out and develop new ones.  There are no new ones.  Yeah.  So that's it.  Figure it out.  Pulling seems – that would work well.  Yeah.  Speaking of that, Jimmy, you know how they tortured Rambo? 
[03:21:30]  Any of that go down?  Torture Rambo.  Remember how they tortured Rambo in the movies?  What did they do?  It was pretty brutal stuff.  I think electricity was involved and water.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If there's electricity and water, I'd be talking right away.  Who needs that?  And that's like the deer hunter.  Remember that?  Putting him in the cage in the water.  Rambo took a lot, dogs.  Yeah, that was tough.  But it's nothing like that.  It is – you would be surprised.  I mean, as would the general public.  Sure.  If you went in there and you saw exactly what we put these shitheads through and what they're responsible for and what they're trying to do to us and their brutality and their – but, you know, again, we love this self-flagellation. 
[03:22:00]  And this country seems to be wrapped up in sort of, oh, my God, we'll lose our humanity if we mistreat people in even a certain fashion, which is bullshit.  I have no trouble telling us from the terrorists.  It doesn't bother me at all.  And if you engage in a harsh interrogation technique to get valuable, actionable intelligence from a terrorist suspect, you don't walk away and think, oh, jeez, I think I lost some of my humanity.  What a load of crap. 
[03:22:30]  Anyway.  I've got to take a shit, too, now.  All right.  So we're going to continue with Mike Baker, who's now becoming a TV star.  Yeah.  We'll get into some other things with you.  Oh, good.  Hang on.  You're filling in for Greg Gutfeld on Red Eye.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  We'll get into that in some other – so the journalism thing is working.  Yeah.  It seems to be coming back around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I took a very circuitous round.  Yeah.  Hang for a bit.  I will.  Yeah, I like this Mike Baker.  I've got to pee, too.  He's a good guest.  We'll continue.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the leech of F.U.'s.  You have six new voice messages. 
[03:23:00]  First voice message.  I want to send a big F.U. to my dumb wife for thinking I'm fucking one of my friends, which  I haven't fucked yet.  But I haven't fucking met any other girl, you dumb cunt.  Fuck you.  Next message.  I want to send a big F.U. to E-Roc because he's a little bitch and he's never going to  get in shape enough to impress anyone.  Fuck you, E-Roc.  Stop being a pussy.  Next message.  I want to say fuck this is a clean lady at work. 
[03:23:30]  She's always cleaning the fucking bathroom every time I got to take a piss on my break.  Fuck E.  Clean something else.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to my fucking cunt ex-girlfriend who had me, divorced my wife  and leave my kids, just so she could get up and fucking leave me eight months later for  some dipshit.  So fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. is for the dumb motherfucker who went into my locker at the fucking gym  and stole nothing but my hat.  My brand new fucking hat. 
[03:24:00]  Fuck you, you dumb piece of shit.  There was $300 cash in my wallet and you took only my hat.  You fucking idiot.  Next message.  I got to give a big F.U. to Sean the intern.  Holy fuck, man.  You're making us all look bad.  You're a pathetic excuse for a man.  Fuck you.  End of new messages.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[03:24:30]  Thank you and goodbye.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Got a busy show.  We're going to continue with Mike Baker in a second here.  But, Jimmy, what do we got going on, man?  We have Nestor Carbonell.  He is, everyone knows, Richard Alpert on Lost.  He only has a few minutes because he's doing a big push today.  Lost is tonight.  It's the next to the last episode in season finale of Sunday.  Nestor.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Thanks for having me on.  How are you? 
[03:25:00]  No problem.  Thank you for calling.  So what are you doing, like 30 or 40 phone calls today?  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  How do you...  Just one after another, right?  So you're not even going to remember talking to us?  No, no.  I'm going to remember that last segment I just heard.  Oh, he heard the FU line.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Well, we got the satellite going.  So you get to curse a little bit.  So your episode was hailed as the best one so far of the season.  A lot of people are feeling very mixed feelings about this season, and yours is the one episode 
[03:25:30]  that's gotten pretty much positive reviews across the board.  Thanks.  They wrote me a great episode.  It was a great episode that they wrote, and I got to play it, so I got lucky.  I mean, it was...  And I got to ride a horse, which is pretty cool.  But, yeah, no, it was a lot of fun.  But, you know, there have been other really...  Well, I mean, the whole...  For me, the whole show, top to bottom, has been, you know, I mean, a dream to get to work on.  But the writing's like nothing else I've seen on TV.  And, you know, Desmond's episode this year was another really good one.  Yeah, his was very good as well. 
[03:26:00]  How does it feel that this show is coming to an end?  I mean, what season did you come in?  I came in season three.  I came in a flashback with Juliet, where I recruited her to the island.  Right.  Yeah, I just came in as a guest, and then it just kind of, you know, like six weeks later,  I got to call her, hey, then what you're back?  And I was like, really?  Kind of like Michael Emerson.  You became this...  You became one of the most interesting characters and one of the leads coming in kind of late in the game.  Yeah, definitely.  It was...  It's like one of those things about this business.  You guys know it.  You just never know what's going to happen.  And this is definitely one... 
[03:26:30]  I mean, I got to move to Hawaii this year with my family, which is a big treat.  So, you just...  You know, that's the...  I guess the beauty and the curse of this business.  You just don't know what's...  Yeah, what's going to happen.  Sorry, Ernesto.  What's it like when you know the show is ending?  Like, you guys have been together for a while now.  I mean, it's a tremendously successful show.  The long shoots, obviously, for an hour show.  And there's a lot of episodes every year.  What is the...  Is everybody kind of sad?  Or is there like a weird cloud hanging over?  How do people...  How are people kind of feeling?  I think, you know, people feel differently.  I mean, like I said, I've only been on since season three. 
[03:27:00]  And really just recurring, flying back and forth.  But for me, I mean, I could stay here for a lot longer.  I mean, we just moved to Hawaii.  And it's, you know, I mean, this is paradise.  So, if the show were still continuing, I'd be thrilled.  But a lot of people, you know, they're ready to sort of move on.  Right.  I would imagine.  So, yeah, it's sort of bittersweet for everybody.  But I'm still here.  I'm in Hawaii right now.  Are you going to keep your house?  Well, we're renting here.  But we're trying to find ways to stay here. 
[03:27:30]  Did you take the helicopter ride over the volcano while you were over there?  You know, I haven't done it.  I hear it's terrific.  One of these days, right?  Yeah.  Now, the question you get a lot, which I know you've denied, too.  I have to ask you about your stare.  And it's odd to ask another man this.  But you really do have a very, very intense stare.  And I know people have asked you if you wear eyeliner.  And that's just you don't.  No, it's funny.  I did a couple episodes. 
[03:28:00]  And someone said, you know, you might want to check out, you know, this little stuff online that's going on.  I go, what do you mean?  And so I went online and sure enough, you know, I was being called Maybelline Man and Guy Liner and all this stuff.  And I've been dealing with this since I was a little kid.  I mean, I remember my mom's friends would sort of comment on it.  And one day I just cut my eyelashes off.  You know, I took some scissors to it.  So I guess they grew back.  But no, we've had a lot of fun poking fun at the whole thing.  It's been fun.  You know, the fans are really intense.  So they get into it. 
[03:28:30]  So it's been a lot of fun.  So I mean under, not even, I mean, I'm sorry, not the eyelashes, but it is actually just the eyelashes being thick and long.  Yeah, I'm just a hairy, I'm a hairy Cuban.  You know, I got a lot of hair.  And I got a lot of hair around my eyes.  Yeah, I've got my little, my youngest boy has the same affliction.  So he's going to have some things to deal with.  No, we just, yeah, I just got a lot of eyelashes.  It makes you look very ominous.  It makes you look very intense.  And you look like a real character.  I mean, I really thought that they, by the way, do you have any idea what's going on? 
[03:29:00]  Like, do you know where it's going to, because there's still a lot of things I think they need to wrap up.  And I know you can't say how the show ends, but how much do you know?  I know nothing.  I really don't.  Week to week, we just get the scripts and we just kind of have to put our faith in the writers.  But I mean, I know how it ends to the, actually, I don't even know how it really, really ends.  I read 10 of the 11 acts.  And if you, only if you were in that last act did you get that last act.  So I don't even really, I'm going to watch with everyone and find out how it really ends.  That's so weird.  Every lost guy we ask, they just don't know how this is going to end. 
[03:29:30]  No, I mean, I have a sense in what they're going to, they're really, what they're going to resolve.  And, you know, and tonight is actually a really big episode.  Tonight reveals quite a bit.  So it's one to, you know, I mean, you know, everyone who watches now will continue to watch.  Now, Nestor, I've, I'm embarrassed to say this.  I've never seen an episode of Lost.  So could you fill me in so I could enjoy the last few episodes?  Like in a sentence or less?  Yeah, like in a minute.  Could you just give me an overview?  Could you catch him up really quick?  You've got a couple of seconds to tell us what the show's about. 
[03:30:00]  And a plane crash on an island.  There you go, man.  And I acknowledge it's my loss.  Loss.  Loss, excuse me.  That I didn't see it.  I should have seen this show.  What do you do people say to you?  What's the show about?  You know, it's, at this point, you know, you can't be a casual observer of the show.  Although I've got to say, this weekend, if you, there's going to be so much recap that  you could probably watch the finale and get most of what you're going to see.  I mean, they're going to be a recap.  I should try that.  I should try that to see if I'm right there with you guys.  But doesn't Hollywood, doesn't Hollywood always say, oh, it's like this and this. 
[03:30:30]  They always try to combine two things.  It's like, it's like the X-Files and Gilligan's Island.  It's true.  Well, you know, I think that the original guy at ABC wanted to do a show blending Survivor  and some other show.  So it has Survivor elements, you know.  And that obviously grew from there.  It became something mystical.  But it has all, you know, obviously the notion of, you know, plane crashing on an island.  And, you know, what would you do on an island?  But that whole, you know, mystical stuff was introduced by Damon Lindelof and, you know,  and J.J. Abrams.  And, you know, they created this incredible world that we got to play in. 
[03:31:00]  But, and it just grew from there.  What is the, of all the lost episodes you've seen?  Because I'm not going to lie, I cried like a sissy watching many lost episodes.  I really have.  And I'd say that without shame or pride.  You're going to cry in the finale.  Because, yeah, I've talked to the editors and they say it's really, it's a very emotional finale.  So, yeah.  It's a very hanky.  Of the ones you've seen, because, I mean, obviously, I know, I believe I read that your wife was a fan first.  Yeah.  So what was something that you remember standing out that really got to you about the show?  Oh, The Constant.  The Constant, I don't know if you remember, is the one with Desmond and Penny where he saw, 
[03:31:30]  it's sort of the first time we get into time travel.  And those, you know, the actors are tremendous.  And the writing was just so good.  And that episode was, to me, stands alone as probably the best episode of the show that I've seen.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a tremendous episode.  But, you know, I mean, there have been so many.  You know, these writers are so inventive.  They're so smart.  But that episode was just, it had everything.  It had all the elements.  And it was very emotional, too.  I want to go back.  You were talking about the last episode and the editors are digging and stuff.  We're not going to have one of those don't stop believing moments like The Sopranos did, right? 
[03:32:00]  Are they going to wrap some stuff up for us?  They're definitely going to wrap some stuff up.  I want to say for us, for the fans.  Stick around, yeah.  No, but stick around for Jimmy Kimmel because he's got some funny stuff about,  he's got some alternate endings on Lost, which are pretty funny.  Yeah, because a lot of you guys are going to be on Jimmy Kimmel right after the finale, right?  We're going to do Jimmy Kimmel right after that.  That'll be cool.  All right.  Well, that's all.  Is there going to be a Lost the musical afterwards if this thing goes up?  Are you going to do that?  I got nothing else going, so sign me up, man. 
[03:32:30]  I'm all over it.  I was going to ask you that.  Do you have your next project after Lost?  Well, actually, no, there's a film I'm going to do in Mexico in July,  so I'm looking forward to that with Andy Garcia and Ruben Blades and a really cool cast.  But outside of that, man, I'm back on the folding chairs looking for the next one.  Well, and with that said, me and Jim Norton have a little advice for you, sir.  Never write a book about beer.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yes, trust me on that one.  Yeah, just we had somebody who wrote a book about beer and it didn't go well.  Yeah.  It didn't go so well, all right?  Yeah.  I like beer. 
[03:33:00]  But never write a book about it.  No, never write a book.  All right.  Great job in The Dark Knight, by the way.  Oh, absolutely.  Tremendous.  Look, it's on tonight.  What time is it on tonight?  Nine o'clock.  And it's the next to the last episode.  Yeah.  And the finale is...  What's that?  Tonight's big.  You've got some big guest stars, too.  You've got two people returning, which make great turns.  They're really good.  Oh, good.  Because there's a couple of people that have not come back yet.  Juliet's not been on this year.  I know they never got Michel Rodriguez back.  They never got Mr. Echo from season two.  They may not get him back.  But there's a lot of people that I've been kind of wanting to see who I haven't seen. 
[03:33:30]  And the season finale is Sunday at what time?  Sunday.  Is it nine o'clock?  No, it might be eight o'clock.  It's two and a half hours.  No, I think it's from nine to 1130.  This lady is saying it's from nine to 1130.  Okay.  Well, there you go.  And in fact, it's a whole night.  So you're going to get recaps before that, I think two hours of recaps before, from seven  or eight o'clock on at eight or seven o'clock.  I can't remember.  Well, thank you, Nestor.  Thanks so much for taking a few minutes.  We know that you're jumping around.  But good luck, man.  I think you're a great, great addition to the show. 
[03:34:00]  I had mixed reviews about this year, except for you.  I think you've been tremendous.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate that.  That's nice.  Take care, Nestor.  I appreciate it.  Thank you guys.  Bye.  There he goes, Nestor from Lost.  He really is great, man.  He's just a solid actor.  And his episode, I mean, I was being too nice, but his episode blew away the rest of the season.  Really?  Yeah, I don't like this season, but he was tremendous.  Yeah.  They got a time machine?  Is that what I understand?  I've never seen.  It's not a time machine, no.  It's a weird, the island has something to do with time travel.  It's an energy source. 
[03:34:30]  And it was actually, it's the most brilliantly written show until this year.  It just kind of shits the bed.  It's really weird.  Like, there are episodes.  Does Travis agree with that?  I know he's a big Lost fan.  No, I don't agree to the extent that Jim thinks that it's bad.  And I'm holding off my judgment until the end of the series.  That's because you don't like me.  No, I love you.  Do you remember the constant?  Do you remember what episode he was talking about?  I do, yes.  That's where he's in the military.  He's in the phone booth.  It's the first time Desmond talked to Penny.  Like, since.  It was very sad.  It was great.  It probably is the best episode. 
[03:35:00]  I think my favorite episode is fucking season two, Dave.  I love Dave.  Dave was great.  Where Hurley is seeing this fucking guy.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trying to convince him to leave him.  I'm looking over at O.B.  He's got the same look I got.  And then he's trying to convince him to jump off the cliff.  He's trying to get him to kill himself.  It was great.  And Libby, they panned her in the mental institution again.  The mental institution?  Yeah.  Because of the booker, I had some of the information, and I do know who is on tonight's episode,  and I do regret reading that.  Don't tell me.  I'm not going to tell you, but it is two good guest stars. 
[03:35:30]  Ricardo Montalban?  Yes.  Yes.  Nice.  And Herbie Villachez is a pillow he covered his stomach with.  Poor little fella.  He might have shot himself in the gut because he couldn't take it anymore.  We've got Mike Baker still in the studio.  He's filling in for Greg Gutfeld, a friend of ours, by the way.  You're doing Red Eye May 24th through the 26th for Greg.  That's true.  He's out there schlepping around trying to sell his new book, which is terrific, by the way.  It is great, right?  It is really good.  Yeah, it's really good.  So I'd encourage everyone to go out there and buy at least three copies of it. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, I'm on one of those with you.  So I'm on me and Anthony are on the 24th.  At the same time?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the first time we've done it together.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's going to be really good.  So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Red Eye, Fox News.  It's late.  It's on at 3 a.m. on the East Coast, but midnight on the West Coast.  Yeah, they DVR that show, though.  Yeah.  And it kills CNN.  Yeah, it's got its audience.  It does very well.  I mean, I remember the first week.  This was years ago, three years ago, three and a half years ago, whenever it got started. 
[03:36:30]  But, you know, doing the first couple of shows and thinking, there's no way in hell this thing's going to stay on Fox.  I mean, it was completely different than anything they've ever done before.  And, you know, I give Fox a lot of credit, you know, not just because, you know, I got a good relationship with him,  but because they sat by this thing.  They let it happen, you know, and they let it develop.  And, you know, it's been paying off for him now.  Do you think Fox gets a bad rap?  Like, we get accused sometimes because, I mean, I do more Fox.  I do a little bit of CNN, but I do more Fox.  Or I'm actually headline news. 
[03:37:00]  But it seems like they get this bad rap like they're irrationally or unreasonably conservative.  And there are things that are said on Fox I totally disagree with.  I think, no, it's too conservative for me.  But just as a guy who performs on the channel a lot, I've never had any shit from the network or anybody associated with it with the opinions I give,  which a lot of times I agree with them, but a lot of times I don't agree with them.  I've never had flack for the opinions from the people that work there.  Yeah, it's funny because the people who complain about it being, you know, too far to one side, you know, 
[03:37:30]  they'll sit down and watch Rachel Maddow or somebody on, you know, MSNBC or CNN.  No, it's a fair go.  I think CNN, you know, makes an effort to be, you know, somewhere down the middle of the road to some degree.  But they've got the same thing as Fox does.  They'll have opinion people, right, and then they'll have the news side.  And I agree with you.  No one's ever, you know, pulled me aside and said anything about, you know, something I've said, which, you know,  it could be construed as being to the left of center.  I don't have a dog in the hunt, frankly.  You know, I want small government.  I want the government to stay out of my kitchen.  And, you know, that's pretty much it.  You know, do what you're supposed to do, but don't do anything else. 
[03:38:00]  But as far as, you know, right or left, I don't give a shit.  Just do your job if you're up on Congress on Capitol Hill.  Right.  What is your security company?  I know you do some – is that stuff you do for private citizens or do you not do it for private citizens?  You know what?  Only if they've got a lot of money.  That's a lot of money?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They've got to be high net wealth individuals.  No, it's – you know what?  Diligence is –  By the way, when anybody says net wealth, you've got to have a shitload of cash.  Oh, yeah.  It can't be gross.  It can't be gross.  It's got to be net.  What is that, a couple hundred thousand?  Is that what we're talking about?  Yeah, it's something like that. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, you could hire us to overthrow a small neighborhood or a country.  Diligence is a – it's an intelligence and security firm, and I don't want to bang on about a marketing spiel, but it's been going for about ten years.  I started it with a buddy of mine who came out of the British version of the SEALs and MI5, and, you know, we do – it's information, it's intelligence, it's risk management, it's security.  It's all those things you'd expect.  It's been a good ride, you know, since getting out of government.  Do you don't do individual stuff, like if somebody needs information on somebody?  You know, not usually.  We don't do divorces. 
[03:39:00]  We won't, you know, sit and follow somebody for an insurance rep.  That's not what we do.  That's a private investigator's job.  Is that, by the way, is that so easy for you guys?  Like, that kind of stuff is so low-level?  Well, you know what?  It's not what we're geared to do.  I mean, if somebody comes to us and says, look, we're worried because we think the Chinese are stealing our secrets because we've got facilities over in China, you know, then we'll pay attention.  Wow.  Really?  We're on that level.  Yeah, I mean, if an opposition party comes to us and says, you know, look, there's going to be an election in Chile and the opposition party would like us to, you know, uncover dirt, they think the current party is stealing money, then we'll look at that. 
[03:39:30]  You know, I mean, it's that sort of thing.  So how many languages do you speak?  Do you speak English?  I do speak English.  You speak it very well, by the way.  Thank you very much.  I've been working on it.  I speak Greek.  Do you understand, by the way, you don't want to say it like that.  I speak Greek is a Craigslist term for women.  Yeah, and when I did that, I just reapplied my eyeliner and winked at Jim.  What does that mean on Craigslist?  I speak Greek is a way a girl.  This is when they try to convince people that they're fooling the cops and do nothing and they're hookers. 
[03:40:00]  Instead of 300 bucks, they'll say, I can see you for 300 roses and you're paying only for my company.  And I do speak Greek, which means I do anal sex.  And I'm looking for French lessons, which is oral sex.  You know, I mean, I've heard.  You did a thesis on this, didn't you?  I certainly did, yes.  It's called destroying every relationship I've ever had.  So you're, I'm sorry, you speak Greek?  No, I don't.  Not now.  I completely forgot how to do that.  What are the languages? 
[03:40:30]  No, forget it.  I'm not going there.  Let's just say I speak a handful of languages.  You speak more than one?  Yeah, more than one.  And you know what?  And that's when, if people are out there and they're considering, if you've got young folks out there and they're thinking about a career in the CIA,  and hopefully there was going to be some music underneath this advertisement, then, you know, one of the things the agency looks for is language experience, you know, language capability.  If you come to the agency as a young person, you got out of college, your grades are decent, you haven't been, you know, doing math.  If you speak Arabic, you know, Urdu, Pashtun, Chinese, Russian, whatever it is, then you're going to get a serious look. 
[03:41:00]  I mean, that's what they're looking for, international experience, overseas, some military time.  I took a few years of Spanish.  That's good.  That'll work.  That's good, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, now, you know.  Don't know shit about it, but I know a couple of dialogues about messy rooms and dirty kitchens.  I can order a meal in a restaurant.  No, I can't even do that after six years.  Six fucking years, I can't do shit.  I did two years of French.  I know none of it.  I did French, too.  Really?  I couldn't give you one phrase.  I passed, though.  I took seven years of public school French, and it did me absolutely no good whatsoever. 
[03:41:30]  My French teacher was really hot, though, and had some of that nice French perfume, and  she had fucking cleavage, man, when the teachers were still allowed to show their cleavage.  Big bosoms.  Blonde hair, bleach blonde.  Do you remember her name?  Nope.  A stereotypical French teacher.  I had it.  Because, I mean, my company could look her up and, you know, maybe put you two in touch.  That's true.  Yeah, but I was...  Torture her for information.  I was suffering and wanting to drop, but she was so, like, just, wow, that I hung in 
[03:42:00]  there for two classes, yeah.  Man, I had a teacher, seventh grade, I went to school overseas in Australia, and seventh  grade, Miss Bridie was a French teacher, and I remember she walked in, and I never paid  so much attention in class since then.  It was unbelievable.  But, again, you know, I learned absolutely nothing from the French.  How many languages would you say that you're comfortable, that you could be conversational in?  Three.  Yeah.  But we've got, you know what, we've got, I mean, my company's got, you know, what have 
[03:42:30]  we got, about 50-some-odd people, and we've got 25 languages spoken in a native fluency.  So it's a very international company.  It has to be.  I mean, so in a way, you know, we're kind of, you know, I suppose you could say we're  doing a lot of the things that I used to do in the government sector.  We're doing a, it's for-profit, we're in the private sector.  But it's, you know, it's a good ride.  It's entertaining.  But, you know, the agency prides itself on, you know, people who are generalists, basically.  You can throw them overseas, they're going to be able to develop sources, they're going  to be able to, you know, handle themselves properly, and language is a big part of that. 
[03:43:00]  Hey, I got a couple good, sure, no, no, no.  I got a couple good questions coming in.  Well, let's say hi to Sal in Chicago.  Sal.  Hey there.  You know who's responsible for killing that guy who invented a water-powered car?  Right on.  Damn good question.  Yeah, I do.  What?  Oh, that's the end of your question?  Oh, see, there was a guy that was bragging.  What year was it, Danny?  This goes back a while.  A few years, right?  Yeah, but...  I don't think it was that long.  I think it was like 95, I want to say.  A guy was bragging that he figured out how to run cars on water all over the place, and 
[03:43:30]  it's going to shut down the freaking gas companies, this and that.  And then it's...  Doesn't the story go that someone from the CIA paid him a visit?  It was like some military general.  Military general.  Went to have lunch with him or something like that, and then like six months later, he died  of food poisoning.  Yeah, yeah.  He died very suspiciously, and it's something we're obsessed with and we bring up from time  to time on this show.  Here's a guy bragging. 
[03:44:00]  Stan Meyer.  Here's a guy that's...  Stan Meyer?  Stan Meyer.  That's right.  You know Stan Meyer?  Uh, no.  No, am I killing him?  Oh, you mean Stan Meyer.  No, I was thinking of a different guy.  This guy was bragging how he's basically gonna, you know, he's...  He's gonna shut down oil companies.  Next thing you know, he's dying of food poisoning.  Yeah, no, no.  That was a little creepy to us.  It is a little creepy, but you can make anything into a Byzantine conspiracy if you work.  If you work long enough for the U.S. government, you know, you quickly stop becoming a conspiracy 
[03:44:30]  theorist, you know, because you realize it just ain't gonna happen, you know.  If we could run cars on water, that would not be good for a lot of people.  Yeah.  It would be great for us.  Yeah.  No, it would be great.  But you know what?  In a sense, people love, you know, it's like the grassy knoll.  It's, you know, I mean, yeah.  How many of these conspiracy theories are out there?  But, you know, I go back to what I said.  But he died of food poisoning.  Yeah, I know.  But that's...  Yeah.  How many times has that happened?  Is that hack spy stuff?  It's kind of hack.  Yeah.  There's other ways to do it?  If they were gonna kill Stan, they wouldn't have used food poisoning. 
[03:45:00]  But they probably would have drowned them.  My favorite is the old pusheroo.  The old pusheroo off the bridge?  That's a building?  It's hard to prove the old pusheroo.  Somebody got pushed.  You're right.  Yeah.  Unless you have paint on your hands, which is a rookie mistake.  There's a fingerprint on it from the paint.  We had a theory about the cruise ships when someone goes missing.  I'm like, that's a guy killing his wife.  Yeah.  With the old pusheroo.  That's easy.  I think any time you look at that.  But you know what?  Honestly...  How do you prove it?  Yeah.  It's tough.  But people love this stuff.  People love one world government.  People love conspiracy theories. 
[03:45:30]  And why not?  They're entertaining.  What's your favorite conspiracy theory?  Oh, good God.  There's so many of them.  Well, I mean the...  I think, you know, the most recent ones, the idea that we went into Iraq for the oil.  I love that one.  You know, that somehow we thought that's a good idea and that that's the reason why people  think we were doing it.  Or that...  Why did we go into Iraq?  Bad intelligence and, you know, a heavy push from the neoconservatives who had a jones  about Saddam Hussein.  I mean, it was just a...  It was a perfect storm of bad information and bad influence and overdue influence from 
[03:46:00]  the neocons in Washington.  That ruined Colin Powell's career.  It really did.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Hung him out to dry in the...  You remember how powerful he was.  Oh, yeah.  No.  And also kind of...  I think it's the reason why he decided, you know, screw it.  I'm not running for president.  In no interest after that and opening himself up to anything afterwards.  But now that was a really flawed decision.  But again, it's hindsight.  The funny thing is, is that we had a lot of our allies on board with that as well.  You know, not to revisit the whole Iraq situation, but we weren't the only ones out there thinking 
[03:46:30]  that there was WMD.  I mean, we had a consensus of...  Now, the problem was that consensus was built on one bad source for the most part.  I don't want to oversimplify.  But, you know, you could argue that, you know, Afghanistan's the same problem.  We spent a lot of time getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan.  Now we're doing the same damn thing the Soviets did.  And right after 9-11, great idea.  We went in there.  We had a hell of a time.  We kicked ass.  Now, should we be there?  Is it important to our national security to be in Afghanistan?  I don't think so.  But we're not having an honest discussion about it.  And, you know...  You think it gets too politicized? 
[03:47:00]  Like, it just becomes, all right, kick the shit out of the right now.  Or the right, kick the shit out of the left.  It's like nobody seems to be point, counterpoint for real.  It's just politicized and people just kind of killing each other politically.  Oh, yeah.  No, I think that's exactly it.  Everybody...  You can't have a non-emotive discussion about anything in Washington anymore.  You know, it just won't happen.  Both sides get, you know, hysterical and out goes all reasoning.  Now, if we said to ourselves, is a stable, democratic Afghanistan, A, is it even plausible in our lifetime based on what we know and the history of that country and everything else that's going on there? 
[03:47:30]  Bullshit.  Of course it's not.  You know, logic dictates that it's not going to happen.  But every generation, we come around and we think, now this current generation thinks, well, we're going to do things smarter and better, right?  And, you know, and McChrystal comes out and says, I got this idea about counterinsurgency.  Well, there's nothing new under the sun for counterinsurgency.  It's the same old crap.  Soviets went through the same thing we're going through.  They retrenched.  They pulled into the cities.  They couldn't hold the countryside.  They spent four and a half, five years trying to get the hell out of there.  They were worried about leaving an unstable government. 
[03:48:00]  Well, what does that sound like?  So we're doing the same thing we did before, and it's not necessarily important to our national security.  Didn't this – I heard that the Iraqis when they're fighting – I mean the Afghans when they're fighting the Soviets would lift the tank.  One of the guerrilla methods they would use is lift the top of the tank, open it up, and throw beehives.  That was – maybe it was only done a couple of times until the Soviets caught on.  What's going to be handling the beehives?  You carry – you wrap a beehive in something.  Some guy in a beekeeper suit.  You wrap them in something.  No, it seems like a big pain in the ass that you're in charge of the beehive. 
[03:48:30]  What a brilliant way to bring down a tank, though.  But also, you've got to stand out, right?  I mean you're approaching the tank.  You're wearing a bee suit.  Yeah.  Aren't you going to know?  Isn't that a clue?  You're swatting a lot in front of the ass.  Can you imagine?  Is that just a myth?  Like what did I do?  No, I've never heard of it, but it would work.  It would maybe work only once.  I would imagine they'd probably try that a couple of times, but as far as something they did on a regular basis, that would just be a nightmare.  Yeah.  I mean it's probably easier ways to do things.  But we're out there.  You've got to make sure there's honey around at all times.  Keep the bees from flying away. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, no, you have to have a lid on it.  Imagine if you just carried the hive loose.  That's what I'm answering.  So, okay, yeah, so Mike from the CIA is just talking about basically I'm a complete asshole and he's correct.  What a fool I am to believe that.  I think we actually looked at using bees to kill Stan Meyer, and that wasn't going to work.  And then we tried to push it real, but, you know, that didn't go.  Jordan's upset in Scranton.  Stop with Stan Meyer crap.  All of his plans are linked to from the Wikipedia page, so any conspiracy to suppress it failed miserably.  Two, he was trying to create a perpetual motion machine, which makes him a complete crank to begin with. 
[03:49:30]  It's all right, but we're obsessed with the story.  Don't need to yell at us, sir.  Geez, yeah.  Great little story.  Take it easy.  He's bragging about how he discovered how to, you know, run cars with water.  What was that guy's name?  And then the guy dies of food poisoning.  It's a great little story.  It wasn't actually food poisoning.  I thought it was because it was after he ate at a restaurant, so I thought it was food poisoning.  But it says here that Stan Meyer died after dining at a restaurant.  An autopsy report concluded that Meyer had died of a cerebral aneurysm.  All right.  What drug do you give him to make that happen, Mike? 
[03:50:00]  Well, you give him some, I don't know, some bad steak, and the next thing you know, he's got an aneurysm.  That's a new one on me.  All right.  Let me say hi to Matt in New Jersey.  Good evening.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  So the food poisoning thing's bullshit?  I like to think he—  No, the theory was that he was poisoned, but the autopsy says aneurysm.  Aneurysm.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  I have a question.  I'm a combat vet marine, and when I was in Iraq in the beginning, our ROEs, our rules of engagement, were pretty simple. 
[03:50:30]  When we felt threatened reasonably, we would squeeze and fire back.  I think most people would say that's reasonable.  Well, yeah, but by the time we left, I basically had to know where the shot came from, who did it,  what his little name was, what his fucking favorite color was, and whatnot.  I want to know what your rules of engagement, when you're with the—you know, when you're in the field, what was your ROEs?  What were your rules of engagement?  Well, you know what?  Our rules were essentially, before going out, we would have lawyers come and sit and talk with us, 
[03:51:00]  and they would say, you know, we're lawyers, and we're not here for you.  We're here for the agency, and we're here for the director.  So if there are any problems out there, then you shouldn't make the mistake to think that the legal team here in headquarters is here for you.  And that was kind of the way that we would start anything.  Our mission was different.  If there's shit blowing up and people getting killed, usually something's completely fucked up. 
[03:51:30]  And, you know, our goal was to stay off the radar screen.  So it's tough to compare.  I really sympathize with what you guys go through out in the field now because, I mean, you're right there, right, at the tip of the spear,  and you're engaging the enemy constantly, and they're putting all these fucking rules on you.  With the agency, we're supposed to be in and out.  Nobody's supposed to know we're there.  And, like I said, if shit's blowing up, then we've got a problem.  But I do remember to this day the legal team, and I love the agency, 
[03:52:00]  but the legal team sometimes could be very funny when they'd come in and say that.  We're not here for you.  Even these guys have to deal with lawyers.  We hate everything.  They ruin everything.  You ever take anyone out, Mike?  Sipping us coffee.  I'm sipping my coffee.  With a little scope action.  You know, we don't talk about anything like that.  I figured I'd try.  Yeah.  But, you know, I will say this.  Anybody listening out there, the agency's a great career.  I highly recommend it.  Wow.  What did your family and friends know about what you did?  Most didn't know anything. 
[03:52:30]  Most didn't know anything.  Immediate family knows.  They thought they showed Mets hats.  But they at least knew you were in the CIA, right?  Uh, no.  No, most didn't.  Most of your family members didn't know?  So what did...  I mean, you know, only your immediate family, you know, would know.  You know, like parents.  Very close.  You know, brothers.  Yeah.  Very close inner circle.  Yeah.  I mean, if you met my extended family, you wouldn't trust them either.  What do they think you did?  Yeah.  You know, government.  I mean, most of them assume that you're, you know, working for the military or for government  or, you know, some...  They just don't care. 
[03:53:00]  That's the funny thing.  If you get on a...  And that's a good point.  I get on a plane...  How do you not brag about what you do to people around you?  I know.  I mean, if I...  We got a dumb radio job when we brag.  Well, yeah.  You're flying around the world taking out guys with scopes and you can't tell anyone.  Look at this.  You guys had George Wendt on this morning.  I'd brag about that.  Yeah, we'll brag about the George Wendt interview for years.  I'll be talking about following him.  We'll make it better than it really was.  You know, give us a little time.  No, but it's a good...  You get on a plane.  I would get on a plane, you know, and I don't like to talk on a plane, right?  I don't want anybody to get in my space when I'm flying. 
[03:53:30]  But someone would turn to you and inevitably they'd say, so what are you going to do?  You know, and the best thing you can do is give them the most boring job you can think of.  You know, I'm a...  You know, whatever it is.  What would you say?  Oh, geez.  You know, I'd start talking about import-export of, you know, some parts or some bullshit.  Textiles.  You know, or, you know, some financial analyst.  Textiles.  I'm a textile salesman.  And you just want them to shut up and not bother you.  And so that's kind of, in a way, in a strange analogy, that's how you live your life in the agency. 
[03:54:00]  You don't want to stand out.  You're just blending in, right?  And the more you can blend in, the better you can do your job.  You know, it's funny you say that because a CIA agent, to me, is a tremendously interesting job.  And very few of us know them.  It beats textiles.  By a long shot, on the interesting scale.  Yeah.  So if I sat next to a guy who was in the agency, I would want to talk to him.  Being a comic, you get the same shit.  I mean, not on that level, but you get enough that people want.  So I've told this story before, but a comedian named Vic Henley, I know, who's a very funny guy.  There's nothing worse than when you're on the plane. 
[03:54:30]  The guy, you see the guy's got a bourbon.  And he's like, so what do you do?  Because it's going to be a long fucking flight.  And Vic had the best answer.  Where he's like, I work for Meineke Muffler.  And he said that he would go from store to store and just make sure that the Meineke's were set up properly.  And he said he never got a follow-up question.  Nobody gave a shit.  I like that.  But if it's the greatest, if you don't know who Vic Henley is, he was in the movie, what was it, Sacha Baron Cohen's newest movie?  Bruno.  He was in Bruno.  He was the ring announcer in Bruno. 
[03:55:00]  I didn't see.  I didn't hit the buzzer.  I don't get the points.  Yeah, he was in the ring announcer.  Best answer ever, though.  I'm a fuck.  I work for Meineke.  I've got to have a better answer.  I always just go marketing.  Marketing's good.  Yeah, because it's very, very, very.  It's too broad, though.  I know.  That's my problem.  What do you market?  Because then they follow up.  What do you market exactly?  Try doing that with prostitutes, and you think they might have seen you on television.  Where do I know you from?  I got photos of myself hanging with celebrities all over them.  They're like, how do you know these people? 
[03:55:30]  I'm a stalker.  Try IT.  Just say IT.  IT?  That would work for me.  If someone says IT, I'd be right asleep.  I wouldn't worry about it.  What do you do for a living?  Because then they always want to, I mean.  Yeah.  No, you know what?  I just hate it.  Which is nice, because I got a cool job.  You can't even call it a job.  But if you write radio personality or something like that, they all just want to talk.  Now you're at a doctor, and you're concerned about some dumb rash or something.  I'm like, how about my stupid rash?  And then maybe we'll talk about what I do for a living.  So I always just write marketing. 
[03:56:00]  You got a rash?  Yeah.  Actually, no.  They're just for this bit.  Oh, okay.  His genital issues change from bit to bit.  It's rash one time.  I mean, I'm far enough away on the table.  I think I'm okay.  I did ask Jimmy in the bathroom during the last break.  There were a lot of guys in the bathroom.  I go, hey, Jimmy, I got a blister on my penis.  Could you tell me what this is?  And a lot of people got a little awkward in the bathroom.  But that was just for our amusement, because Jimmy said, I certainly will look.  My friend Walter, who is sober now, he said that when he was drinking, he was in Shea Stadium.  And he was a postal employee drunk. 
[03:56:30]  And he said there was probably 80 people in the bathroom.  And he just goes, anybody want a blowjob?  And Jordan wasn't upset.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, Jordan calls all the time and writes whatever, but blah, blah, blah.  You talked about conspiracies.  Is it harder?  Like, because you, we would talk about this with, I think, Bill Burr is a comedian buddy  of ours.  He loves a good conspiracy, this Bill Burr.  But we have this myth that the government is like, or whoever it is that's the conspirator, 
[03:57:00]  is this mechanism.  They all wear white coats, and they are flawless, and they don't make mistakes.  And I said, these are the same people that get the shits from the wrong food, or they  get car sick, or their wife is a bitch, and she's getting fat.  It's like, there is no upper echelon of human.  Right, right, right.  Like, no, that's a good point, because people watch, I mean, you watch Lost, not that I  ever have, or something else, and you get this image of, you know, again, of one world  government, or somehow the, you know, government agency is controlling the world. 
[03:57:30]  And honest to God, I mean, I think everybody should have to work for the government for  at least a year or two.  I mean, I think that should be a requirement, because A, the first thing it would do, it  would end all conspiracy theories, right?  I mean, it would just stop it.  Half the time, you know, it's tough to organize a ham sandwich when you're working for the  U.S. government.  And you just, it's a very, you know, good environment in a sense, but you got the same  people.  It's like you said, you got the same people as you have out in the private sector, right?  There's no, you know, training is different, you know, your functions are different, yada, 
[03:58:00]  yada, yada.  But no, it's the sort of thing where I think if you could do that, if you could insist that  people had to spend a year or two in government service, we'd straighten up a lot of the screwed  up misconceptions straight off the bat.  Wow.  Interrogate, right?  That's what we're learning about you today?  Yeah.  Could you interrogate Danny and find out why he doesn't like Kenny and interrogate  Kenny to find out why he doesn't like Danny?  I caught that first episode of the Kenny Hates Danny show.  Yeah.  That was really good.  We spoke outside in the hall for-  You and Kenny did? 
[03:58:30]  Yes.  Like 25 minutes.  I'd rather have that on the air.  Yeah.  That awkward talk after the conference.  You guys seem to end on a good note.  We'll see.  Yeah, you seem to end on a good note.  Yeah, I mean, you know, we tried to, you know, have a real discussion as human beings.  I don't think there could be any promises made, but I think that-  What the fuck did you say about me?  See, I called you a scumbag, actually, under my breath.  You guys made up and you don't even tell me?  That shit has to be on the air.  No, we just came to a conclusion.  What's the conclusion?  Oh, it's going to ruin everything.  It's going to ruin a 25-minute watch list. 
[03:59:00]  Yes, Kenny.  What's the conclusion?  Oh, you got a legitimate guy here.  Mike.  Mike Baker.  Is Kenny's mic on?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I think it's because there's too many mics on right now.  Okay.  Yeah, I can't do anything about that, Kenny.  I'm sorry.  Are those guests mic on?  Because usually they take out.  No.  No?  Okay.  No, I saw them.  They had a nice little conversation after the show.  Everything went well.  Danny walked away.  Kenny looked at me and said, what a fucking douche.  I knew it.  What's your take on the conversation that you and Danny had?  I'm terrific.  Misunderstanding?  That was what you took away from that conversation.  I'm terrific. 
[03:59:30]  He took away that he's terrific?  Was it a misunderstanding?  Yeah, who's better than me?  Somewhere along the line, I think the show got split into teams and stuff.  I think we got to bring the whole team back together.  I think we all got to start by saying hi in the morning.  Let's all start with a good old hi.  I did mention to Kenny that we all do work for the same show here, and it just seems a little  odd that there would be bullshitty little infighting like that.  So let's just all make the show as good as it could be.  Kenny, you're good with that?  Yeah. 
[04:00:00]  I got to tell you, as a former CIA officer, I'm not really buying his body language.  He didn't look like he was selling himself completely there.  There's an underlying issue.  I don't want to play Dr. Phil, but it's an underlying issue.  If I were you, I wouldn't get in a dark room with this guy because he's going to beat the  shit out of you one day.  There's a lot of rage.  I don't have to trust Kenny.  I just have to function with him.  Yeah, but Mike, that's a very good point.  Now, by this body language that Kenny has, if you could even call it that, what can you  tell us about Kenny? 
[04:00:30]  What can you say?  You know what?  First thing, he's a stand-up guy.  He's standing there.  He's open, right?  I mean, if he was standing there, his arms were crossed.  He was kind of looking down, kind of looking at you sideways or whatever.  But the way he's standing, very open.  I don't think he's trying to hide anything except for his dislike of Danny.  And frankly, I've just met Danny.  I understand.  But no, I think just taking him right there, his posture is basically an open, honest stance.  Unapologetic, almost.  He's not going to bullshit.  It's very accurate.  Kenny's a guy who, Kenny, the interesting thing about Kenny, and Kenny, when he was Dice's 
[04:01:00]  road manager and security guy, you know, Kenny at times is hard for people to take because  Kenny can be very harsh, but I've never met a guy who was less phony when it came to wanting  people to like.  Like, Kenny will tell you, and I might have talked about your situation, Kenny will go,  no.  Like, I'm such a weasel.  It's hard for me to say no.  It's really hard for me.  But Kenny will say the things that we all kind of want to say. 
[04:01:30]  He loves saying those things, too.  Yeah, the fact that he has a tenting in the front of his pants is the problem.  Yeah, we think he gets boners when he ruins someone's day.  But it's an ability that I kind of admire because I want to be liked so much.  And it's not that he doesn't, but Kenny's willing to do things that are going to make  him not like.  And I'm really not talking about this situation.  I'm talking about stuff that's happened on the road with club owners.  Like, well, they'll try to fuck you for an extra few tickets.  And I'm like, well, don't you think?  And Kenny's like, I counted 350.  You're saying 330.  He just calls the guy out. 
[04:02:00]  It's like, you have an ability to do that that I don't have.  And Mike, if that's your real name.  Yeah.  If you're looking for new guys.  I changed my name after that, Stan Myers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Kenny's one of those guys that should be running a...  He's an interrogator, too.  He should be running...  Are you cutting him loose and he's going to be looking for a job soon?  Is that what we're doing?  I don't know.  No, not at all.  But, I mean, Kenny's trying to get his own little thing going.  So I'm just saying.  Well, a lot of people have a hard time with the no.  He's amazing.  A lot of people don't want to say no.  I mean, a lot of people.  That's a natural thing. 
[04:02:30]  I mean, even in the agency, you get personnel reviews.  We have the same systems internally.  It's like you were talking about.  It's not a different world, right?  It's the same processes and it's a bureaucracy, even though it's small and it's a great operation.  But personnel reviews, you get people coming in and even CIA guys would hate...  Or women would hate to sit there and say something negative about the person they were reviewing.  So what do you do?  You get the same thing you get everywhere else.  You kind of pass them along.  Right.  Because, hey, what the hell?  Okay, no, you're doing a fine job.  Get them out of here.  Just get them out of my office or my team or whatever. 
[04:03:00]  What does Kenny's dry hair tell you?  You know, I think he's a sort of guy who likes to get up in the morning and just kind of get going.  You know, he's not fussing a lot about his hair.  I'm probably vitamin deficient.  I'd have to know you a lot better before I could judge that.  Kenny stepped up his game today.  Kenny's a very interesting guy.  Yeah, you know what my problem is, Mike?  It's not what you say.  It's how you say it. 
[04:03:30]  That's my problem.  Have you ever said anything to somebody like, for instance?  Oh, everything.  So you think your delivery needs work.  Yeah, it's all in the delivery.  That's always been my curse.  Didn't you one time, like, he walked up to a woman who had a little baby and he's just trying to be nice.  He goes, nice baby!  I thought that's where you were going.  It's one of my dumb jokes from my act that I used to do.  You never know when Kenny's going to torture you with your own material.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, if you can diplomatically say no, that's a hell of a skill and about 2% of the people on the planet have that ability. 
[04:04:00]  Here's a good example.  Like, the first time I worked with Jim years ago, when he was opening for Andrew Dice Clay, big show, 5,000 people, a lot of pressure on the guy, right?  Being the opening act, you've got to warm up the audience, you're walking out there cold, right?  He's fairly, you know, new in the business, trying to step it up a notch.  Hoping the Dice audience is going to warm up to him, all that stuff.  You know, biggest comic on the earth at the time now, he's the opening act. 
[04:04:30]  And right before he went on stage, there was a ritual where Andrew had a stool, and I used to set the stool with two bottles of water,  and I used to put a towel on the rung of the stool, right?  And you didn't mess with that, with Andrew's water.  And Jim, his little crutches, he sips a lot of water while he's on stage.  I call it an asset.  Yes.  See, it's not what you say, it's how you say it.  See what he did right there?  Look at that.  So Jim wanted to walk out with his bottle of water, and he was going to put it on the stool while he was doing his act, right? 
[04:05:00]  And I told Jim, right before he walked out, right, big pressure, I said,  if you forget that bottle of water on the stool, when you come off stage, just keep walking.  Yeah, because he likes to make you comfortable.  I almost quit the tour because of Kenny.  This is like, we were in Florida, I remember, and I had never done the Vegas, that was the big gig every year, it was Vegas.  Dice would do ballys every year, Kenny's family, and Dice's family.  And so Kenny said to me, because I had never done the gig with the families, Kenny just took me aside and went, 
[04:05:30]  you would never hurt a child, would you?  I was like, what?  Well, Dice had small children at that time.  Yeah, but it was just...  Jim was a little more promiscuous back in those days.  And you would probably run the crim check on Jim, and so you knew to ask the question.  Yeah, yeah.  That's smart.  Yeah, did you run a background check on me when I first started?  I didn't care, no.  It's smart if you did.  No, I called Florentine, and he stood up for you, he vouched for you. 
[04:06:00]  All right.  You know.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, one more phone call, then we're going to get out of here.  We've got John in D.C.  John.  All right, what's going on?  Thanks for waiting.  You've waited a long time, I see.  That's all right, man.  I'll live, I'll live.  I'll wait longer.  Hey, listen, bud.  I'm in D.C., Westfield's area.  That should sound familiar to you, yeah?  Are you asking Mike?  Yeah, I'm asking Mike.  Yeah, yeah, it sounds familiar.  All right, good deal, good deal.  It should.  Listen, man.  I mean, there are two kinds of XCIA guys, okay? 
[04:06:30]  There's the guy that gets...  Listen, man.  I mean, there are two kinds of XCIA guys, okay?  There's the guy that gets out, makes a living, drags his knuckles like everybody else.  Because up here in D.C., when I tell people I'm XAgency, I mean, it's, yeah, and everybody  is XAgency up here.  Oh, they're XO, they're X something.  Right, right, right.  I'm X Mossad, yeah.  Yeah, but you go down to Houston, where I'm from and I tell people what I used to do,  you know, everybody shits their pants.  Well, you're making a living, making people who don't know better shit their pants, and 
[04:07:00]  I'm just curious.  Do you ever feel like a douchebag?  Because people like me, you kind of sound like one.  Yeah, sometimes I do feel like a douchebag, and sometimes, you know what, I am a douchebag.  Here's the good news.  I agree with you 100%.  Perfect.  You are 100% accurate about everything you say, so you know from what you speak, which  is nice.  Right, well, that's good.  I appreciate you saying that, yeah.  Hold on, why is something Mike, though?  Yeah, Mike is never good on a radio program and talk about the shit that you're talking  about, man.  Well, now, can you cite anything that I've talked about that you'd consider to be classified 
[04:07:30]  information?  Oh, dude, listen, you know, you can talk about classified information without talking about  classification.  We both know that.  I think that's what I mean.  You got to run that one past me again.  That was...  No, you got to run that past me again.  You can talk about the non-specifics of where you went and what you did, but you're talking  about what you did.  That's the same fucking thing, man.  No, I'm missing it, but by the way, how long were you in?  I was in for 13 years, and I did every stitch of my time overseas.  I never did a single stitch in the States.  That's good.  Do you enjoy it?  Oh, dude, it was fantastic. 
[04:08:00]  It was good, wasn't it?  Yeah, actually, my wife and I is former NSA.  We were both in.  Hold on.  She was NSA, I was agent.  Hold on.  John, I'm a little confused because I thought that Mike was speaking pretty vague.  Very generally.  I was wishing that he would have been a little more specific.  Listen, he loves being vague, and we're all very good at being vague.  The difference is that some of us get out, and we're not vague.  We don't talk about it.  We keep our secrets.  But hold on, buddy.  Let me ask you a question. 
[04:08:30]  It seems like he kept all his secrets.  Mike has decided he's going to make a living going out and talking about it.  And to people like me, not you, not Jim, not Ant, I know Ant's not there, and not Opie.  I mean, hey, Opie, you've got a lot of agency people who listen to you on a daily basis, brother.  You have a big following here, okay?  Let me jump in for just a second.  What was your name again?  What was your name again?  John.  John.  John, I appreciate what you're saying, but a couple of things.  First of all, I make a living by a company that I started 10 years ago that does a shitload of business in the intelligence and security world. 
[04:09:00]  And the second part is that, you know...  How do you get to the front celebrity if you don't know any about her?  Hold on, John.  Let him finish.  Well, yeah, exactly, John.  Lighten up just a little bit.  But the second thing is I've got a very good relationship with the agency, and I do that because they know I'm not going to be a douchebag and talk about anything, sources, and methods.  And also, you know, when I left, I left overtly.  So I've got the ability, and they worked with me on that. 
[04:09:30]  I've got the ability to talk about, to the degree that's responsible, what I did.  Now, you know, you've got to jones about it, and I can appreciate that.  It just makes me feel I get douche chills from it.  You know, it's like you're very accurate about a lot of it, but sometimes, like, you know, when you're talking about torture and you're talking about all that stuff, you know, it's like these are certain things I just don't think should ever be spoken publicly by people who are in it now.  Well, but, John, I mean, I agree with you.  If you talk about it, if you listen to what I had said, I talked about how we shouldn't be giving away the information that's in our kit bag. 
[04:10:00]  We shouldn't be talking about that shit.  But at some point, it's not a bad thing to have people in a vague way defending what it is that we try to do in the national security world.  All right, man.  Listen, I understand.  I know what it's like to leave.  I was never in a position to where I had to negotiate what I could and couldn't talk about.  I just made a decision that had been my wife that we weren't.  So when I hear someone like you, I have to ask myself a question. 
[04:10:30]  Is this guy doing this for the better good, or is this guy just trying to impress somebody?  Right now, I'm on the fence with you, but I hope you're on the show more, because I'll listen to you.  Trust me.  And I like you.  You're the nice enough guy, man.  And plus, I, too, wish everybody did a little time in the government.  That way, we could just wipe all this stupid conspiracy shit off the map.  It had good sense.  But some of the things, I just got a little queasy.  Well, you know what?  No, but I appreciate that, because, I mean, at least, you know, you've got something going for you that a lot of people don't.  You know, you've moved from thinking I'm a complete douchebag, which, again, I can't be on time, to saying that I'm an okay guy. 
[04:11:00]  And so that I appreciate.  And listen, we're all douchebags.  It's the question of which one of us are going to be okay.  You're a good dude.  I'm pushing out.  All right.  Thank you.  Take off, man.  I think Mike spoke very vaguely.  Yeah, I guess I read that wrong, because I really was kind of not frustrated, because I thought it was still good radio.  But I think, from a personal standpoint, I was hoping you would give me a little more.  John, I mean, you can't.  And like I said, I understand what John's saying, I suppose.  But at the same time, believe me, if I was coughing up anything I'm not supposed to be talking about, you know, I would have a conversation with my old outfit. 
[04:11:30]  But I'm not going to do that.  And I've said consistently since I've been out, you can't open your app.  You can't talk about things that you shouldn't be talking about.  You sign a deal.  You've got paperwork out there saying, I'm not going to disclose classified information.  And you don't do it.  And I've been pretty clear about that.  But I think John, you know, John, yeah, interesting guy.  What a weird place to be, though, man.  You guys have a very interesting job, and you can't talk about it.  John said something that – I'm sorry, Ken.  John said something that bothered me. 
[04:12:00]  He goes, I don't think that stuff should ever be spoken about publicly by people who are in the know.  Now, all those Department of Justice things that were released, it's out there.  It's out there because of the administration had this stuff released.  So basically it's all this information thrown out there with nobody to speak about it.  So if you're here talking about it and giving it a human point of view, like this is why that stuff was not as bad.  Well, I think that that's fair to want that point defended.  There's no reason to say that someone who knew it – he's like saying that shouldn't be talked about by anybody who knows what they're talking about. 
[04:12:30]  It doesn't make sense.  Basically, yeah, yeah, and what I'm saying is that to the degree that's appropriate, it's not a bad thing to have some people on the other side of the argument who are saying, you know, here's why you shouldn't be releasing this fucking information from DOJ.  Here's why you can't just rely on the Army Field Manual of what we're talking about as an interrogation.  Or this is all the good work that the agency and other members of the government in the intel community – this is what they do.  So that's not a bad thing to be banging the drum on occasion when they deserve it, and they often do, without going into specifics. 
[04:13:00]  And you haven't said one thing that was releasing information that wasn't released in the Department of Justice documents.  Yeah, he doesn't want ricin in his lunch.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't want to end up like Stan.  Are you kidding me?  All right, we should wrap up.  Wow, Mike, thank you.  Mike Baker.  Mike rules, man.  He's on Rai next –  You'll come back, right?  You know, make me your official national security advisor.  I'd love to come back.  That's great.  Sure, why not?  I'll speak just in general terms and piss off John.  No, he turned around a little bit. 
[04:13:30]  Yeah, I think he's good.  He sounds like a good guy.  A little bit.  I want to hear from John more as well.  And we know we have a lot of people listening in Washington.  Yeah.  I met Secret Service with Voss.  The freaking Secret Service liked the show.  Yeah.  Well, the guy's under Bush anyway.  Yeah.  We ran into them in Arizona.  Oh, believe me.  Yeah, your show is really popular down in Washington and Virginia.  Yeah, right on, man.  So you're going to be hosting Red Eye May 24th through the 26th, so three days when Greg  Gutfeld is out.  That's cool.  Jimmy's going to be doing one of those.  Me and Anthony are doing that Monday the 24th together. 
[04:14:00]  Excellent.  And I'm supposed to do the show.  I guess I've got to start doing it or something.  You should.  You should.  You give it a go.  It's a very fun show.  We'll be on Monday.  Then we'll have the whole team there.  Yeah.  We'll get Kenny and Danny back for a quick five-minute segment.  Not a bad idea.  Nice fight.  Anything else you promoted, Mike?  No.  You know what?  We talked about it.  We banged out about the company.  That's good.  You're doing an episode of Deadliest Warriors, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll keep that one.  We'll keep that one under wraps.  We did that. </pre>
