<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a range of topics during its final week in their current studio.  The hosts began by expressing their anxieties about the upcoming move to a new, less private workspace, which they described as "glass boxes" akin to a "sweatshop."  They then launched into a giveaway segment, offering listeners a variety of items from their office, including World War II newspapers, Stephen King books, Ramones action figures, multiple copies of "Brocabulary," a copy of David Tyree's "More Than Just a Catch" (unsigned), XM radio merchandise, a mystery box, and a signed "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" poster.

Anthony recounted his weekend, detailing a large family gathering marked by disagreements between his mother and Sal.  They watched "No Country for Old Men," leading to further arguments. He also shared humorous – and potentially controversial – photos from the gathering on Twitter, including one of his nephew wearing a Nazi officer's hat.  He further described witnessing a car accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

Sports dominated a portion of the show, with discussion focused on the men's NCAA college basketball tournament and Tiger Woods' recent golf tournament victory.  The hosts debated the University of Connecticut's mascot and its relation to "Yukon," and bantered about Woods' win and another golfer's "choke" in the final round.

The show also included a lineup of anticipated guests: Bill Burr, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, and Tony Darrow (the *Goodfellas* actor).  A humorous segment cleared up any confusion between the actor Tony Darrow and a comedian of the same name.  This segment culminated in a short, fictionalized, and vulgar exchange between Opie and Tony Darrow, mimicking a scene from *Goodfellas*.

[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Who would I sacrifice in a chimp attack so the family gets 50 mil? 
[00:04:00]  50 mil for a chimp attack.  50 mil for a chimp attack.  50 million?  I'd put on a chimp outfit and bite my mother's face off.  I was lucky enough to be in Istanbul.  It's 90-something percent Muslim, but it was the good kind.  I mean, every once in a while you would see one and they would point out that's a radical Muslim.  They were pretty regular.  Holding a head in his hand.  This is what's left of a Pennsylvania dog kennel after a propane tank ignited, setting the pens on fire. 
[00:04:30]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah.  Good morning.  Hello.  Hello.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  First week, or last week, I should say.  Yeah.  A little early.  Last week at this fine facility. 
[00:05:00]  This is it.  The final week.  Then I think we take a week off and then we start the new joint.  That seems to be the schedule, as they say.  We're not going to go with the fake suspension this year?  No, dude.  Keep everyone hanging.  Are they going to be back?  I guess we'll finally tell people we're going to be on.  No, we don't do that.  No, no.  But I saw the people lining up outside as we pulled up.  Yeah, the crowd realizing, you know, it's the last opportunity to see the big show. 
[00:05:30]  The big show.  The big show live.  Before we're put into a glass box with the rest of the dummies.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And they are dumb over there.  The glass boxes that are the offices, hallways, studios.  Yeah.  They think it's futuristic looking.  Is it?  It's just a lack of privacy and ugh.  We joined Communist Radio in two weeks.  We're just like everybody else.  Yup. 
[00:06:00]  Glass studio after glass studio after glass studio.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Into the radio factory.  Yeah.  We had our own nice little thing happening here.  We felt special here.  Mm-hmm.  And we were alone.  We were kind of out of sight, out of mind kind of a thing.  Yes.  And now we'll just be one of the little children working in the sweatshop.  I hope I get to make Nike sneakers.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Because I'm a big sports fan.  Please let me make the Nike sneakers.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah.  Do you?  Well, that's where we'll be.  So, yeah.  The fans are already lining up.  We got, I don't know.  We're giving away our office today.  Yeah.  Or every day this week.  Uh-huh.  Not too happy with the stuff E-Rock picked.  No.  We got some old World War II newspapers because, you know, people think Anthony wants to collect  them all.  Yeah.  But he can't bring them all home.  So, we're giving some of those to the listeners today. 
[00:07:00]  Yep.  Got a couple Stephen King books over there.  Some Ramones.  What is it?  Action figures.  Oh, well, Sam.  You know what?  I stand corrected.  Sam found the thing to give away today.  Wow.  Some lucky listener will be walking home with four copies of Brocabulary.  Well, no.  We'll give four separate listeners.  Why?  What if they want to share with friends and family? 
[00:07:30]  Then they're going to have to go out and buy it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Brocabulary.  We should just force one guy to take all four home.  What am I going to do with this crap?  Right.  And prove that you gave it to someone that wants to read the book.  Yeah.  We also have a copy of David Tyree's book, More Than Just a Catch.  Ah, right.  The Big Catch.  Yes.  But this is more.  Yeah.  Did he sign it before he, like, ran out of here?  I don't believe it is signed.  No.  All annoyed.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  He was annoyed.  That was one of those franchise interviews.  Yeah.  And then Major League Baseball XM t-shirts.  Wow.  And two official XM office phones.  I see that.  Ah, yeah.  Look at that.  I see that.  They're old, crusty phones with earwax in the receiver.  Yep.  I think, yeah, you'll find certain people's face grease and earwax all over the receiver.  And if that's not good enough, there's a set of broken headphones over there.  Really?  That I believe have Danny's name on them. 
[00:08:30]  So, those were actually used for O&A show prep.  By Danny?  Yes.  Wow.  We've thrown a few times.  Sure.  In extreme anger.  That's cool.  So, that is good.  Somebody would want that.  And then an XM flag, microphone flag thing.  Oh, look at that.  And then you got, I see you got a Chaz Palminteri script over there as well.  Yes.  And then you're opening up the big poster.  What's that, Sam?  What is this?  A big poster of... 
[00:09:00]  This actually isn't a bad one.  Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Signed by Jason Segel and Russell Brand.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  That's not bad.  Yeah, we've got to have a couple things that are worth taking home.  And, of course, the mystery box.  What's in the mystery box?  I see that.  It's a secret.  Oh, it's a mystery.  Not what's in it, too, is it?  All right, nice.  Wow, people are going to be pretty excited today, I think.  Yeah.  When they take to the bleachers.  And they just got to stare at that for a while.  Thinking, ooh, am I going to be one of the lucky few that gets some of the goodies. 
[00:09:30]  I got to tell you, the stuff isn't good enough to play Let's Make a Deal.  I think we have to just throw this stuff at the listeners.  Maybe tomorrow's stuff will be better for a Let's Make a Deal segment.  Yeah.  This is like we have to kind of force them to take it home.  Yeah.  They're like our garbage men.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll throw a couple signatures on there, and then they'll maybe want it.  Oh, well.  Who the hell knows?  Yeah, you should sign the David Tyree book.  Yeah, why not?  All right, we'll sign the David Tyree book from our famous interview with David Tyree. 
[00:10:00]  That we never really did.  And now we'll never get another football player on our show ever, ever again.  That's a whole bunch of dopes.  There you go.  What do they have to offer?  They're boring, most of them.  They don't tell you any intriguing stories.  So, yeah, tell us about some of the players.  Well, they're all great guys.  Yeah, really?  What was that?  Well, I ran, and then I caught the ball.  Yeah.  And then I ran some more.  Speaking of sports, I know you're a big college basketball fan.  You must have been all over the TV all weekend. 
[00:10:30]  Some great games.  I could not believe it.  Which one did you like the most?  Wow, my brackets were upset.  They were just, I couldn't believe it.  Who got knocked out of your brackets?  Well, I think Villanova.  What are they again?  Villanova.  Good, good, good.  Villanova.  What happened to Villanova?  Oh, they got taken over by Gostavio.  Oh, boy.  No, not them?  Boo!  Virginia. 
[00:11:00]  Villanova beat Pitt.  Pitt, that's the one.  No, but you made it sound like Villanova was knocked out.  Oh, no, because I wanted Villanova to be knocked out.  Oh, but they, wow, now I'm confused.  I have no idea.  Villanova, that was an amazing last second victory by Villanova over Pitt.  Isn't it amazing that I even said Villanova, though?  Yeah.  Because I had no idea that they were even in it. 
[00:11:30]  That was probably the game of the weekend.  Probably.  Wow.  So, not bad.  See?  Not bad, my friend.  If only I knew, they won against Pitt.  And the Huskies, Huskies, you're pulling for the Huskies, right?  Where are they from?  Close to New York.  Dare I say, bordering New York.  Oh, well, that only leaves a couple of states.  That's right.  New Jersey.  Is that your, are you, are you?  When the Huskies are from a state that has a turnpike in it and they like to play college 
[00:12:00]  basketball, but they're from Jersey.  Oh.  Yeah.  Bobo.  I was laughing at the Bobo all weekend.  Well, Bobo's turning Springsteen into a jam band all the time.  What happened to just getting to the point?  I don't know.  Springsteen does get to the point with his songs.  Pennsylvania?  Oh.  Oh.  The Huskies?  Oh.  Yeah.  Connecticut.  Connecticut? 
[00:12:30]  Huskies.  Why?  How was everyone's weekend?  I thought that was Yukon.  What happened to Yukon?  The Huskies.  Oh, that's, that's them?  Yeah.  You gotta have a little, you gotta have a little, like, mascot.  Now, wait a minute.  Yukon.  Why is it the Huskies?  Are they really running with the University of Connecticut being Yukon and then going Yukon  like the Yukon up north?  The freezing cold Yukon and the Huskies pull the sleds?  When you say Yukon, are you spelling it Y-U-K-O-N?  At first, I actually thought they were from the Yukon. 
[00:13:00]  Okay.  And then I heard University of Connecticut was like, oh, that makes sense now.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's silly that a basketball team would be from way up there.  Yeah.  No, it's U-C-O-N-N.  Now I get it.  Yukon.  But the Huskies, the mascot, seems to me to come from the name Yukon, which is the Yukon  because that's where the Huskies kind of pull the sleds.  You know what?  You finally got me. 
[00:13:30]  I really don't know.  I wonder.  Maybe because it sounds like Yukon, Y-U-K-O-N, they decided to go with Huskies.  They ran with it.  Yeah, maybe.  They ran with the whole Yukon thing.  I do need a little Wikipedia because now I need to know why they came up with the Huskies.  Let's see if that's a fact, Jack.  And who else?  Who else is in it still?  What are we down to?  The final four?  Oh, you got Michigan.  You got...  Oh, no.  The Elite Eight.  North Carolina.  They couldn't figure out that eight one, could they?  They got Sweet 16, which is like, that makes sense. 
[00:14:00]  Final Four, that makes sense.  Elite Eight is stupid.  Well...  It's stupid.  Who has the...  Should have been the Great Eight.  Who has the home field advantage at the Final Four?  That's a very good college basketball question for you, my friend.  Home field advantage?  Which is crazy because every year it's kind of like the Super Bowl.  They move it around, right?  And they're very excited that they have a chance to actually play at home.  And that would be Detroit.  Michigan.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Wait, how do you know that?  Because they're playing in Detroit.  You knew that part?  Yeah.  I catch dribs and drabs.  I'm like a retard.  I know not to swallow certain things, but still I got a stomach full of pennies.  That's the beauty of the show.  We know what we know.  Yeah.  I know a little college basketball.  And I know a little...  The one subject I know a lot about we just can't spend too much time on, and that would  be the PGA.  Ah, yes.  I know that would bore the hell out of everybody, so you just got to go headlines there. 
[00:15:00]  Tiger being in it back again and pulling out a victory like that.  Dude, Tiger, what, his third tournament back from reconstructive surgery, hasn't played...  He had to take, what, eight or nine months off.  Yeah.  Third tournament out, he wins.  They didn't have all the big stars in this tournament, but still.  Well, he was down six strokes or five strokes going into the final round, playing against  this youngster, and you could see it in his eyes.  This youngster was like, oh my God, I'm playing with Tiger Woods. 
[00:15:30]  Oh no.  Because what people don't understand, you see these guys on the golf course, they don't  hang out with each other.  No.  Like, most golfers never get to really spend time with Tiger Woods unless you're in the  final round with him walking up the fairway because, you know, you have a chance to win  this thing.  Yeah.  But now you're walking up the first fairway, and it's Tiger Woods, and you're a young guy  in the PGA, you've got to be losing your effing mind.  You have to be freaking out.  Yeah.  So the headline is very easy. 
[00:16:00]  The guy did, like, just completely lose it, blew a huge lead, and Tiger Woods has his  first victory in the big comeback.  Bit of a choke, huh?  Well, yeah.  Was it a bit of a choke for the kid?  Yeah.  So I think the kid shot a 73 and Tiger shot a 67.  Oh, wow.  On the final round, you just don't do that.  How many strokes was he ahead by?  Five or six.  I think it was six.  No, it has to be five, right?  Yeah, five.  Poor little feller.  Yeah.  Just the wheels falling off.  Oh.  But that was, I can't get enough of, you know, watching Tiger Woods win golf tournaments. 
[00:16:30]  Simple as that.  He got to play with Tiger.  I did?  No, he got to play with Tiger.  So he could take that home with him.  Yeah, that's true.  Which is nice.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  Jimmy got to meet Tiger Woods.  Really?  Yes.  Lucky duck.  The UConn mascot's name is Jonathan, named after Jonathan Trumbull.  And then this guy, oh, Kent the movie guy just writes ZZZZ.  But, like, what does it have to do with a Husky? 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  We're still trying to figure that out.  And Kyle from Michigan, he's right.  It's Michigan State, not Michigan.  Well, I said Michigan.  That's the closest I'm going to get, Pally.  Michigan State, whatever.  So the rest of the country is Michigan.  To you guys that are a little more local, Michigan State.  That's like Texas and Texas A&M.  It's not our fault that you have a million stupid colleges named after the state.  Yeah.  And you just, you know, the difference is naming one state and naming one not state. 
[00:17:30]  USC, UCLA.  Like, those things are always like, you know what?  Confuses you.  Yeah, very confusing.  North Carolina has literally 20 teams.  Who keeps track?  Who wants to?  Right.  How was everyone's weekend?  Weekendy.  Yeah?  Yeah, I had the family over last night.  Ah, Sunday's family night for you.  Sunday seems to be let's go over Anthony's house.  It's becoming the thing to do.  I had the entire family over. 
[00:18:00]  Kids and everything.  Oh, yeah.  The kids, the both sides of the, you know, the parents, my brother and sister and Patrick  and Kate and mom and Sal and Keith and Angela.  And, uh, it was, it was just, um, exhausting.  It was exhausting.  I was twittering some pictures from the house.  Yeah.  Of various toys and things on my couch.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Um.  Any boogers on the couch?  No.  Not yet.  The kids are too young for boogers.  Yeah, but they're not too young to do a little, like, green puke.  No, I know.  They're very careful, uh, the parents.  Very careful with the puking.  They've heard the stories.  They keep the kids over the tiles when they're feeding them and stuff like that.  Oh, nice.  You know, the tile floor makes for easy cleanup.  Sure.  But it's not even the babies that are a problem.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's my mother and Sal.  Yeah.  They have reached that point in their life where they cannot say one word to each other  without the other one spouting off something. 
[00:19:00]  Like, Sal will just be like, uh, so Anthony, my brother's coming up from, uh, Baltimore and,  uh, I was thinking of bringing him over.  And my mother would just be like, oh, Sal, stop it.  If, if Anthony's around, we'll figure that out when, when, when that comes up.  Don't even, what?  Jesus, Ro, I'm just asking the kid.  Well, you know, wait until he, you know, he might be busy that day.  Well, that's why I'm asking him, Ro.  And I'm sitting there just like, which is just both of you shut up. 
[00:19:30]  They're just nagging each other constantly.  They just are constantly peck, peck, pecking.  But they seem to love each other.  I mean, they don't have any issue.  The issue is they've just been together way too long.  They've been together forever.  I think it happens to every couple.  No matter who you are.  So we, uh, we go to the, uh, the, down to the theater so we can, a screen, a film.  We were watching No Country for Old Men.  Mom has not seen that.  That's not a kid's movie.  No, no, no kids.  The kids had already, the kids had finished watching Monsters, Inc. 
[00:20:00]  How, how old are the kids?  Like six months?  Something like that?  Five or six?  Not those kids.  Uh, uh, Keith's, uh, an ancient kid.  Okay, right.  They were down there watching Monsters, Inc.  Nice.  And then when Monsters, Inc.  is over, uh, then we went downstairs and watched No Country for Old Men.  Right.  And, uh, my mother and Sal down there, my mother 20 times with, I know that actor.  He was in another movie that, and I was like, no, the lead nut guy.  I was like, no, he's, this is like his first American movie.  This is the big movie of his. 
[00:20:30]  No, I, Sal, I've seen him before.  Ro, would you shut up and just watch the movie, Ro?  Just shut up.  I'd seen him.  Anthony, what was he in?  He was in another, well, I pull out my phone, internet movie database.  I go, look, mom, look, every other movie is in Spain.  Every movie is Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain.  I go, he's got some in post-production, uh, that are coming out, but this was like his  first big movie.  Okay.  I know I've seen him, though. 
[00:21:00]  Ro, would you watch the movie?  Who cares?  And they're peck, peck, pecking and missing the movie.  What happened?  Who is this guy?  Well, if you listened and watched, Ro, you'd know.  And then halfway through, you hear Sal.  He's dozing off.  Oh, he's asleep.  So, I don't know, but I know I've seen him in another movie.  No, shop.  What's the name of this one?  No Country for Old Men. 
[00:21:30]  What does that title even mean?  Well, it seems that this country and what's happening, I go, if you look at the character,  what's his name, the lead, Tommy Lee Jones, you know, it's like, it's gotten too much for  the old men in the country.  It's just too crazy and everything.  I'd seen that guy in another movie.  Oh, my God.  You wouldn't stop.  Maybe she loves foreign films.  It's her little secret love thing.  No, they're both losing their effing minds. 
[00:22:00]  You think?  That's what's happening.  They're both losing their minds.  Yeah.  And I'm just witness to it over my house.  Your Twitters were very funny yesterday.  We kept sending out pictures of his...  Oh, yes.  There's one very funny one.  Well, there's one I remember.  It was just funny because it said, aw, it's Sunday.  That must mean my house is overrun with kids, but they're adorable.  And he meant to write booger free, but he wrote bugger free?  Bugger free.  That was my iPhone correcting the spelling before I hit it.  Can't you turn off that feature? 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  I turn it off on my BlackBerry.  But it's really handy sometimes.  Most of the time.  80% of the time, it's helpful.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why I go with the odds.  Do a little spell check.  I just got to eyeball it a little.  Yeah.  I hate that feature.  I turn that thing off immediately.  Immediately.  Like Jim said, I'm playing the averages, the odds.  It works 80% of the time, but buggers.  Yeah, but everyone's when you get a fun mistake like that.  Yeah, and then little Warren Dean, just looking adorable in a Luftwaffe Nazi officer's hat. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, no way.  Oh, his big round head with a little Nazi officer's hat on was hysterical.  It's adorable.  I wanted to start a new bit today, but after you said that, I don't know if I could play it now.  I think I'm going to lose.  Because the only reason I wanted to start the bit was because I thought I would win.  Oh, really?  Best Twitter picture of the weekend.  Oh.  And I had a couple doozies, but that one is right up there.  That's a Lulu.  Yeah.  It's got cuteness and horrifically offensive all in one picture. 
[00:23:30]  I think if we were to vote or the listeners were to vote, that might win, unfortunately.  Yeah.  I thought I was being clever with the picture I had of a group of 14-year-olds dancing at the bar I was at.  That was a good one.  Down there in Philly.  We were watching the Villanova game, and we were watching, I was the only Islander fan, which is really strange, in a Philly sports bar, basically.  Sports bar slash pizza place.  That's why the 14-year-olds running in, about 20 or 30 14-year-olds running in.  Some great fights in the Flyers-Islander game. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  But I wrote one, and I wrote, I'm out recruiting new talent for my pal Ant.  Ah.  And then ended it with a, oh, Uncle Paul.  And it's a bunch of 14-year-olds, very happy that they were getting their picture taken, not knowing what was going to be done with them.  Ah!  What did they think?  I don't know.  Like, did you just snap their picture, or did you tell them, hey, let me take your picture?  What did you do?  Honestly, I had some help, because I knew if I went over there and tried to take a picture.  You'd just be creepy guy taking pictures.  Like, most of my pictures you see on my Twitter, I do. 
[00:24:30]  But every once in a while, you need a little help.  So, it was my mother-in-law, who was all very innocent.  Ah-huh.  Ran over there like, girls, let me get your picture.  I hate to tell the people this, because they're smiling so nice.  They were really smiling.  And people are like, wow, why are they smiling so much at you?  Not knowing that they're just going to be crucified on Twitter.  And then my other one that I would have put in the competition would have been the car crash.  Yeah, how's it going?  Cars upside down.  Holy mackerel.  I was on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and also on the cars. 
[00:25:00]  We've all been in this situation.  You're rocking.  We're doing 70, 75, not getting too crazy.  And the next thing you know, everyone is at a standstill within two seconds.  Like, everyone jamming on their brakes, no real, you know, no other real accidents, just the one.  And then we see Clear Road, literally a quarter mile up the road.  I'm like, this thing is between us and that Clear Road, obviously.  So I ran up to see this car completely overturned on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  The woman crawled out of her own wreckage. 
[00:25:30]  Crawling from the wreckage.  And she was just sitting on a guardrail, and her stuff, it was a yard sale.  Really?  I can't believe how much stuff came flying out of this car.  CDs and clothes.  And we had to go search for a cell phone on the side of the road.  I was right there.  I thought I might have to help pull the woman out.  But the best I got to do was help find the cell phone, and I wasn't the guy that found it, but somebody else did.  But her stuff was everywhere. 
[00:26:00]  And we were stuck there for well over an hour as this thing was overturned.  You see the slide mark from the hood?  Yeah.  What did she say what happened?  Did you get to talk to her or anything?  No, I wasn't one of those guys.  It was about five or six around her, making sure she was all right.  SUV?  Everyone's saying SUV.  It was more like a little, kind of like a Honda Accord type of vehicle, but it wasn't a Honda Accord.  How long were you stuck for?  About an hour.  Wow.  At least an hour.  I mean, it was one of those where everyone's out of their cars, just on their cell phones.  No shoulder to go? 
[00:26:30]  No, no, because the stuff was, I'm telling you, it was everywhere.  And then someone did try to, like, start the parade.  Yeah.  One guy's like, you know what?  We could sneak past here.  Sure.  So he gets in his car, and then, you know, this dope that decided he has to block the traffic going the other way.  I guess he was, I don't even know if he was an official, you know, person.  Start yelling, oh, no, no, no, no.  And ruined it for everybody.  Say, shut up.  Because we could have got by that.  I'm moving.  I got things to do.  Wait, why did a guy block it the other way? 
[00:27:00]  You know how they do.  I'm looking for your picture.  He stopped in the left lane on the other side of the median.  Right.  To, like, get out and help.  Right.  They do that all the time.  They don't care that it's going to inconvenience everybody.  Yeah.  You know?  So they stopped.  Bad enough of rubberneckers, and now you got to.  Yeah, a truck stopping on the, you know, the traffic going the other direction.  So just a complete nightmare.  But I don't know.  I think the kid with the hat might win.  Best picture of the weekend.  Yeah, the kid with the hat.  As far as tour pictures go.  Warren, yeah, it's an adorable shot. 
[00:27:30]  Adorably offensive.  There he is.  Look.  Oh, my God.  That is a very cute picture.  Look at that little round face with the little Nazi hat on.  I got to tell you, I think you win.  I'm going to give you the victory.  Because that is so offensive.  Yeah, because every white supremacy site in the country would be honored to have that.  That's going to be on, how many sites is that going to be on?  Yeah, Jimmy goes, this thing will make the rounds.  That'll ruin the kid's political career, no matter what he does in the future. 
[00:28:00]  Was this you?  Flunk.  Uh-oh.  Who the fuck is Warren Dean?  That was Tweety, you assholes.  I think that picture's going to make it to CNN or something.  Yeah.  He's a fan of the era.  Yeah, I see Sal has no problem with it as he's holding the kid.  Yeah, well, at least Sal's eyes aren't in it.  The kid is adorable, man.  Aw, isn't he?  Yeah, he's very cute.  Little cute baby fist.  Oh, Sal's eyes are in it.  Oh, well.  Oh, boy.  Eh, what are they going to do?  Eh, he's retired. 
[00:28:30]  What are they going to do to him now?  Come on, leave him alone.  Although they might think he's one of the guys they're still searching for.  Yeah.  I love when they drag those guys out of Queens every once in a while.  Yeah.  What?  I was just a soldier.  Just living his new life for the last 50 years, thinking he's, you know, safe.  And they pull him out of some kind of home in Queens to face his crimes.  Yep.  Flying off to Israel to be shot.  There you go. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, so I had that going for the weekend, and wow.  That was just, like I said, exhausting.  I can imagine.  Wait till they get a little older and they're running all over your house.  Yeah.  You only got about six more months before that is going to start happening.  Yeah, and my house is anything but baby proof.  Right.  I don't have to baby proof anything.  There's crushed glass on the floor.  Yes, I do.  I sprinkled crushed glass.  I put marbles on the stairs.  There's all kinds of just things to make it fun. 
[00:29:30]  You should do that just once, and then guess what?  They're not coming over every Sunday anymore.  They won't come over.  Because, you know, those little children to parents, they don't care who you are.  They'll never come over again if they think it's not a safe environment.  Then I threw the old, you know, the door of flame in the fireplace.  Yeah.  And apparently Warren loves fire.  Oh, that's good.  So he's constantly crawling over toward the fireplace.  Perfect.  I thought it would be funny. 
[00:30:00]  You know, one of those old gags where someone gets too high and you're watching the kid and  then they come back and they notice that in the crib is a door of flame log.  Like, where's my baby?  Oh, no, man.  That's like with the turkey.  Yeah.  When the mother came home and the babysitter had cooked the turkey, and the mother's horrified.  She goes up to check the kid and looks in the crib, and there was a little turkey in  the crib.  She goes, but where's the baby?  And she smelled like something cooking.  Oh, man. 
[00:30:30]  Oops.  The old switcheroo.  Is that an old wives' tale?  Yeah, yeah.  Some chick was stoned and cooked the baby and put the turkey to sleep.  Was it the same cook time?  Yeah, really.  Gotta eat.  It's gotta be tender.  What's up with the mustache on this woman on TV?  Wow.  I know it's a visual and I apologize, but what's this story?  That woman had a mustache.  I don't even think the mustache is the story, but it should be.  Yeah.  That was horrific.  There's actually a good clip floating around.  I think it's on break this morning. 
[00:31:00]  I would have pulled it, but it didn't really work for the air so well.  It was like the New Zealand version of Good Morning America or whatever, and so they  were interviewing some lady who had an obvious mustache.  And then they go back to the anchor and he's having a tough time not bringing it up.  Oh.  And then I guess they have their version of instant feedback.  So he's like, oh, I'm just going to read some things that are coming in from the audience.  And he goes, well, this one.  He goes, this one just says mustache.  Mustache.  Is that clear?  Yeah, I can pull it up.  Mustache.  That mustache.  Yeah, mustache. 
[00:31:30]  Mustache.  Hey, we were talking about the old Nazis that they find living among us.  Every so often.  I wish I had more info on this one.  They recently arrested a guy, Nazi, charged him with accessory to 29,000 deaths.  Ouch.  You're going to serve a little time for that.  You think?  You're going to kill him.  Yeah, but you know what?  God, you think you've made it.  If you know you're one of these guys that were responsible for 29 deaths.  29,000.  29,000, excuse me.  And you know you got a good 40 or 50 years in without anyone knowing? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  You got to consider yourself a bit lucky at that point, no?  Time to face the justice.  Yeah.  All right.  Ah, I see they're letting the audience in.  Yeah, apparently so.  That's good.  Yeah, we're letting them in early for the last week, so.  Yeah.  I mean, they were outside just standing there awkwardly in the dark.  It was very creepy to see.  Why don't we take a quick break and get into some of the really good stuff that has happened.  We got another cat story.  I love the cat stories.  Cats?  Have you heard the latest cat story? 
[00:32:30]  No.  Yeah.  A home with a lot of cats.  Oh, really?  One of these?  A lot of cats.  The neighbors were always like, no, I smelled something bad.  We always talked about the smell.  Go knock on the door.  Wait till you hear about the one room.  Yeah.  There was one room in the house.  Uh-oh.  Where I guess the cats did their business.  Oh, wonder.  I guess they decided to just give the cats one room to do whatever the hell they wanted.  Ew, a whole fucking room.  Just wait till you hear about the one room. 
[00:33:00]  Or is it throughout the whole house?  I heard it was one room.  How many girls they could fit in a phone booth?  Really?  All those guys in there, too?  What the hell's going on?  That would be very claustrophobic.  I would not like that at all.  I wouldn't be able to do that one whatsoever.  No way.  All right.  We'll take a quick break and get things going.  I hear Bill Burr is doing the show all week because he's in town.  Hey.  That's very cool.  Why is he in town?  Is he doing a gig?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  And we got Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne calling in at 830.  And Tony Darrow will be stopping by to say hi. 
[00:33:30]  Who is Tony Darrow?  He's the comedian or the guy.  In Goodfellas.  He's in Goodfellas.  The owner of the bar that they used to go to, the little club.  It's too bad.  It's too inside.  But Anthony said it's the comedian because we still don't know who we're talking to at 7 o'clock.  We think it's the guy from Goodfellas, but there's also a comedian called Tony Darrow, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Sam, have we figured this out yet?  It's been going back and forth for off and on for about a week. 
[00:34:00]  What?  Yes.  He's right outside.  He's the actor from Goodfellas.  Oh, where's he?  And the Sopranos is very famous.  He's very well known.  He's a great actor, too.  Yeah.  Awkward.  Where is he?  Our issue.  He's talking to Steve.  Our issue was that Tony Darrow's a buddy of mine, comedian, so they said Tony Darrow is going to come in.  I'm like, oh, good.  He's a friend of mine.  Yeah.  They're like, he's not a comedian.  I'm like, yes, he is.  Yeah.  I didn't know this actor's name was Tony Darrow.  Yeah.  It was the big mix-up. 
[00:34:30]  This is Tony Darrow with a W.  This is Tony Darrow with a great film credit.  Yeah.  My friend Tony Darrow has not got a good film credit.  No, he hasn't been in any films like Goodfellas.  Remember, he's the guy that goes to Pauly for some help because, you know, Pesci put a bottle over his head.  I know this Tony Darrow.  I'm happy it's this one and not the other one because I don't know the other one that Jimmy knows.  It's a lot of confusion.  Yeah.  And it went back and forth for like three meetings.  And until recently, we figured out, all right, we finally figured out it's him. 
[00:35:00]  Of course.  And ShamWow guy.  I think we're going to save that story for Bill Burr.  Oh, wow.  I thought I was, you know, I woke up this morning.  I read that so late.  I thought I was dreaming.  Really?  Because it's just so weird.  And the mugshot's fantastic.  The ShamWow guy is a naughty, naughty boy.  He's a dirty, dirty boy.  He must go through a few ShamWows himself.  Soaking up all sorts of stuff.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:35:30]  Naughty, naughty.  Naughty boy.  That ShamWow guy and that nut chopper dude.  And I want to make sure.  Can Tony see us right now?  Where's Tony?  Way in the back.  It's this guy, right?  There he is.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Of course it's that guy.  Now we see.  Yeah.  This guy's worried about he didn't want to come over and give the check.  He could take care of this.  Yeah, it's no problem.  Tell him to put it on my cat.  Of course.  That's what I want to talk to you about.  You know, it ain't just this here. 
[00:36:00]  It's seven fucking big ones here.  Seven fucking G's you owe me here.  $7,000.  I mean, they ain't peanuts.  I don't mean to be out of order, no.  You don't mean to be out of order?  Jeez, it's good you don't mean to be out of order, son.  You call embarrassing me in front of my friends, don't you know, like calling me a fucking deadbeat?  You know, you know, sonny, you're a real fucking mutt.  You know the money we spend on this fucking...  What are you talking about?  Come on, don't be like that.  What do you mean don't be like that?  You don't be like that.  You're the other laughing.  What is this crap? 
[00:36:30]  The Leona laugh.  That's the best part is the guy gets a fucking bottle smashed across his head and Leona cannot laugh at him.  He's just...  That, when Maury's being choked with the phone and his wig comes off, he's laughing at that.  Oh, Jimmy, come on, Jimmy, you're going to kill him.  Underrated, that laugh, huh?  Oh, it's fantastic.  That Ray Leona laugh rules.  It means something bad is happening.  Oh, no kidding.  You know, they treat me like half a fag over here.  All right, we'll talk to Tony Darrow next. 
[00:37:00]  Very cool.  Opie and Anthony just getting started. </pre>
