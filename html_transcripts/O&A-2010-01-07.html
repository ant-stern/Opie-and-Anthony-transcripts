<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts introducing their new "Shit Radio" persona, marked by extreme vulgarity and sexually explicit content.  They immediately launched into a discussion of Gary Coleman's recent hospitalization, speculating on the causes after recounting their own prank calls to him, jokingly suggesting a possible connection.  The rumor of Coleman wanting a nude scene removed from a film was also debated.  This segued into a listener's question about New York traffic reporter Jill Nicolini's hypothetical willingness to engage in "breakup sex" with Anthony.  The hosts then lamented a past decision that cost them appearances on the David Letterman Show, leading to a discussion of Letterman's controversial joke about Amanda Simpson, President Obama's newly appointed transgender employee, and the ensuing controversy surrounding Simpson. The segment ended with discussion of a video showing a prisoner escaping during a perp walk, and a commentary on the perceived disconnect between 2009 murder rates and gun sales.  Upcoming guests Bob Kelly and Patrice O'Neal were mentioned.

The show continued with a focus on the lack of mainstream media coverage of the relationship between rising gun sales, a declining murder rate, and the struggling economy. The hosts criticized major news networks for ignoring this perceived statistical anomaly and offered their own analysis.  This led to a critique of Sean Hannity's commentary on Obama, while expressing a preference for Hannity over Keith Olbermann. A significant portion focused on Obama’s broken promise to televise healthcare reform negotiations on C-SPAN, using a montage of campaign statements to highlight the discrepancy. Callers offered varied opinions, some criticizing the administration, others defending it or pointing to similar bipartisan practices.  One memorable analogy compared the broken promise to an undelivered bucket of Popeye's chicken.  The discussion touched upon the perceived boredom of C-SPAN and other cable channels. The segment abruptly shifted to a serious discussion of Artie Lange's reported suicide attempt, with the hosts expressing concern and well wishes.  Lange's recent successful appearance on Jimmy Fallon was mentioned.

Patrice O'Neal then joined the show in-studio. He shared his disillusionment with the entertainment industry, comparing it to a corrupt police force and citing a lack of integrity and pervasive cynicism. He discussed his experiences, his health, and his evolving perspective.  His appearance in "In the Cut" was mentioned.  He also commented on the Gilbert Arenas gun incident, arguing that Arenas' lack of contrition was the problem, not the gun itself.  The conversation included tangents on raw food diets (and a hilariously bad squash spaghetti dinner).  His reflections on aging and mortality were interwoven with discussions about his will and his mother's dying poinsettia.  The segment also touched upon his personal life, describing his miserable relationship with his girlfriend, their unconventional start, and his feelings of loneliness despite his success.  He contrasted what he perceived as white people’s "niceness" with his own experiences.  A discussion about the intimidation levels of various Opie and Anthony show regulars, including himself, Nick DiPaolo, and others, followed. Bob Kelly's presence outside the studio was noted.  The conversation shifted to guns and gun ownership, including a discussion of suicidal ideation in a hypothetical context.  Further tangents included the website "BeautifulPeople.com," its discriminatory policies, and Bobby Kelly's fluctuating weight, prompting reminiscing about his past and present physical appearance.  The segment ended with continued discussion of "BeautifulPeople.com," fat people, and humorous anecdotes, including a story about a heated confrontation with an Asian woman.  The segment was marked by consistent profanity and sexually explicit language.


The next segment began with a graphic recounting of a man's past sexual experiences.  This segued into a humorous story about sneaking a woman out of the host's house and the subsequent reaction from his roommate. The conversation then shifted to the hosts' experiences with overweight people, especially on airplanes, and their views on a website advocating discrimination against overweight individuals.  A significant portion involved the repeated use and testing of a shock pen on various guests and staff, with the comedic focus on their reactions.  Kenny's surprising resistance to the shock was noted.  The show then reviewed *Avatar*, including detailed discussion of the plot, characters (praising Sigourney Weaver), 3D effects, and the constructed language.  This transitioned into a discussion of other movies, including a lengthy debate, often contentious, about Sylvester Stallone's acting ability, and a preview of *Kick-Ass*, focusing on a controversial scene with a young girl using profanity.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of *Kick-Ass* and its potential box office success despite its controversial content.  Guests included Patrice O'Neal, Bobby Kelly, Kenny, and D-Boy.


The final segment opened with a vulgar critique of a children's movie.  The hosts then discussed actors whose careers had declined (Eric Roberts, Jan Michael Vincent, Tom Berenger), speculating on the reasons using crude language, contrasting them with actors who had maintained or regained popularity (John Voight, Sylvester Stallone, Kevin Costner).  This led to a lengthy and profane discussion of their top five movie villains, using highly offensive terms to describe characters and actresses.  The discussion included detailed, often profane, opinions on films such as *Waterworld* and *The Postman*.  Specific actors and films mentioned included Mickey Rourke, Mark Wahlberg's performance in the *Planet of the Apes* remake (which was heavily criticized), Heath Ledger's Joker, *Star Trek* (praised), *Cloverfield*, and *Clash of the Titans*.  The segment concluded by promoting a stand-up comedy show featuring Bob Kelly and Patrice O'Neal, with playful banter between the hosts and guests.  Gallagher's upcoming appearance was briefly mentioned, with humorous anecdotes.  The show ended with a discussion of a video of a homeless guitarist playing "Creep" that had gone viral.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio, we've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic and wrong, sexual content is realistic, and just fucking people reacting with people is realistic. 
[00:00:30]  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name, Shit Radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact, oh my God, Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butthole is.  That's funny.  This is Shit Radio.  It fucking stinks.  It stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Hi, everybody.  How is everyone this fine morning?  Good, boss.  Good.  Is it a little warm in here?  Well, it was really cold this morning in here.  Yeah.  So I just went, I went all the way up. 
[00:01:30]  So now we've got to adjust.  Now it's getting a little, it was freezing, man.  Yeah, when you walk in, it could be freezing.  The good thing is the room is a closet.  So it heats up or cools off very quickly.  Look, guys, guys, guys, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  It's going to be so much better for you guys over here.  Love it.  Just pleasantries, Anthony.  Pleasantries for the new year.  Not even a weekend.  Pleasantries.  Pleasantries.  We did not kill Gary Coleman. 
[00:02:00]  Let's start with that.  Poor Gary.  I think we came close to killing Gary Coleman, but we didn't actually kill Gary Coleman.  There's a rumor out there.  I saw a lot of Twitters going, uh-oh.  Oh, I got killed yesterday.  What'd you do?  One guy just writes, I knew you guys would eventually kill somebody.  Oh, he's not dead.  I think we have killed a few people, but.  Is he okay?  I think so. 
[00:02:30]  I think he's doing better.  Basically, yesterday, Gary Coleman called our radio show.  Yeah.  He was promoting midgets and mascots.  Oh, boy.  We can't remember.  Midgets versus mascots, I think.  Right, right.  Basically, the mascots have won.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  And he was doing our show and a bunch of other radio shows.  He's trying to get a full frontal nudity shot taken out of it or something.  Oh, really?  But I think that's just a publicity thing.  Wait, so no one has seen this movie yet?  It's out on DVD? 
[00:03:00]  I thought it was in some theaters.  I thought it was, too.  Maybe some tiny theaters in the middle of nowhere.  I have no clue.  So I guess the movie's such a piece of garbage that it's only on DVD.  You've got to buy it to see it.  Yeah.  And before it is released on DVD, he wants his penis cut out of the movie or something?  Take out of the movie.  But that sounds like a way to sell the DVD.  Like, he goes around saying, I'm trying to, you know, I don't want this released.  My penis is in it.  Right.  And then people buy it because they want to see Gary Coleman's penis for some reason. 
[00:03:30]  But, wow, he was rushed to an L.A. hospital yesterday morning.  Well, just to give you our part of it, we were going old school and doing our Gary Holdman.  Gary Holdman.  Gary.  Well, it kind of makes sense.  Gary Holdman on cold.  Well, it was almost on cold.  Gary Coleman on hold bit.  Yeah.  It was a classic bit from our NEW days where we kept him hanging out for, I think it was days. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Then we got silly with the stupid bit.  Yeah.  But we decided we were going to just, like, fuck with him all morning yesterday.  And in between us fucking with him, I guess he was trying to do some other radio shows.  Maybe a little too much work, a little stress for the poor guy.  He's not in the, you know, he's a little frail.  Yeah.  Then all of a sudden he got a little woozy in his hotel room.  And they were, what was the question they were asking him?  Something weird. 
[00:04:30]  Like, what's the weather outside?  And he couldn't answer.  Frightful.  So all of a sudden they said, oh, boy, 911 time.  Oh, really?  And they rushed him to the hospital.  And some people saying stroke.  Some people are saying seizure.  Some people are saying he's fine.  Some people are saying maybe he just needed to eat.  They said they gave him a CAT scan and everything, and it came back fine.  Yeah.  So he's all right now?  Apparently.  Doing fine after hospitalization. 
[00:05:00]  It says, but about his penis.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I guess.  God.  Poor guy.  41.  Poor Minnie Earl.  Minnie Earl.  He really is Minnie Earl.  It's Minnie Earl.  Well, okay.  And, yeah, everyone making a different stroke comment.  Isn't that weird that the star of different strokes almost had a stroke?  That's terrible. 
[00:05:30]  That is a little weird.  Poor guy.  It's just weird how that turns out.  But we didn't kill him.  No.  Or try to work.  Well, some people are saying that the static noise we were playing over the phone could  have triggered something.  Oh, that might have done it?  In his whole brain.  That cell phone too close to the microphone sound effect?  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, I was just checking that out, too.  Hmm.  I'm telling you.  You think I should put a call in or something? 
[00:06:00]  You haven't done the breakup sex yet.  It's not over yet.  I mean, it's been over for, what, over a year?  That didn't look bad, though, in that dress.  But you didn't do the breakup sex.  Breakup sex ends it.  All right, here it is.  Any common, you know.  Yes.  Any common friends.  I know there's listeners that also know.  Any common.  Reach out.  Put a little telegram something.  Anne wants to know if Jill Nicolini from Channel 11 here in New York City, the traffic  girl, is willing to do breakup sex with Anthony to make it official, right? 
[00:06:30]  Let's just go one more time.  That's it.  It's called breakup sex.  Yeah, yeah.  One more time.  People know what breakup sex is.  Just let it rock one more time.  You let it rock one more time, and then it's over, and then both parties can finally  officially move on.  Go our own ways and move on.  Even though it's been over a year.  Yeah.  You want to hear the Gary Coleman stuff from yesterday?  Sure.  So some people, maybe you didn't hear this yesterday, are saying this could have been 
[00:07:00]  the cause of his situation.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  The thing is, we're not, we're still in friggin' break.  These goddamn breaks they make us do.  Yeah, it's a little nuts.  We're going to talk after the break.  You doing a lot of these today, Gary?  Uh, uh, no, no, I'm just doing a bunch.  I'm trying to get the word out.  Yeah.  All right.  Gary?  Gary?  Yeah?  Gary? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah?  Are you, are you here electronics or something?  That's one of those.  Yeah, I know that, but.  Phones.  God, are you?  Gary.  Gary?  Gary?  Gary?  Gary Coleman?  Gary?  Oh, see?  Put their phone on.  Bad cell service there in LA.  Oh, God.  I hate when that happens.  It's usually a cell phone close to the, um, microphone.  Mm-hmm.  Or some of the equipment.  That's weird.  Yeah, that's weird. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sure he'll call back after the break.  I'm sure, yeah.  Fucking assholes.  Heh, heh, heh, heh.  So we were messing with him all morning.  Yeah.  And some people were trying to make the connection.  Yeah, yeah.  Then he called back.  Gary?  Yes?  God, what the F is going on?  I don't know.  It's, uh, gremlins.  No, I'm calling from a hotel.  You're calling from a hotel?  Yeah.  Well, maybe you should use the hotel phone, because your cell phone is really, I don't  know.  No, no, I'm calling from the hotel line. 
[00:08:30]  You're calling from the hotel line, and we're still getting that, uh, that weird, like,  cell phone static.  You know, if the engineers don't fix them.  Gary!  Gary!  Gary.  I'm, hey, listen, I'm, I'm...  Where are you right now?  Maybe it's some kind of interference in the hotel.  No, no, no, no.  I need you guys' help on something.  No, I, I...  I need to, I need to get your listeners involved in this. 
[00:09:00]  Gary.  Yes, Gary.  Gary.  Where are you sitting in the hotel room right now?  I'm, I'm on the phone.  No, I know you're on the phone, but there's some kind of, like, interference.  Like, are you near a TV or something?  No, no, there's no...  Nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Nothing?  No, no, no, no electronics sharing the wall anywhere.  Where are you staying in the phone?  That's shut up.  What the hell is that noise, then? 
[00:09:30]  Do you hear it, Gary?  You know what, I'll, I'll, I'll call you back.  All right, please call me back from, like, another line or something.  Because we have some weird interference happening.  Got a cell phone or something, maybe?  All right.  I don't know.  All right, yeah, all right.  Who was, who was on the background?  Was that Willis?  All right, we're back live.  Yeah, someone said something in the background.  I don't know what it was.  No, I was laughing over the clip because I, unfortunately, the static, I hit the button  at the wrong time.  You were saying, what are you, staying at an Amish hotel? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, he had no electronics, he said.  What the hell was going on with him?  So, some people trying to make the connection.  That noise is really, really obnoxious.  Yeah, it really is.  Does that trigger something, you think?  I don't know.  I know that kids would have Pokemon seizures if the lights would flash a lot.  Maybe he has this sound-induced seizure.  Oh, really?  Yeah, who knows?  So.  I don't know.  I'm not taking the blame.  So, he's doing better, and supposedly, he's going to try to call our show today. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, that'd be nice.  And I think, in there, he said, I need your listeners' help with something.  I think he was going to talk about the penis thing.  Yeah, his penis.  He doesn't want his penis in that movie.  You think he has a small penis?  Uh, if you have your penis in a movie, and you want it taken out of the movie.  That means it's small.  I would suggest you have a small penis.  You know, that's a really good point.  I would, uh, imagine you would have a small penis.  What guy doesn't want his penis out there if it's...  If you're looking large.  If it's looking impressive.  If it's plumped up.  Right.  And I'm not talking hard on. 
[00:11:00]  No, no, no.  It's got to just kind of look like it's just sitting there, but...  Naturally plump.  But you know...  Yeah.  ...that something's going on.  Just...  You gotta get it.  Just a little bit's going on.  You gotta have the picture taken just before it's ready to twitch.  Just before it's ready to take the twitch.  And, uh, then you'll look like a fucking hero.  Oh, yeah.  Once it twitches, though, then it's like, wait a minute.  I think you...  Then you just...  Yeah, now you just...  Come on.  Then you just kind of look goofy. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, then it's like, come on.  That's not proven anything.  Yeah.  Heh heh heh.  Uh, let's say hi to Matt in Arizona.  What's up, Matt?  Matt.  Hey, Opie.  Last year, uh, 09 was the year of the celebrity death.  I was wondering if 2010 was the year of celebrity death caused by Opie.  Oh, wow.  Well, I mean, Anthony had something to do with that, too.  Why do I always have to take the blame?  Freaking Anthony was in there killing him, too.  Yeah, but you were killing him, too.  I was, you know, just having a conversation.  Were you? 
[00:12:00]  Yes.  I sleep well at night, man.  I did.  I think I did call him a gremlin.  Yes, you did.  And, uh...  There were a few in there.  Yeah.  Uh, let's go to Eddie in Ohio.  Eddie!  Eddie!  How's it going, gentlemen?  Hi.  Good morning, Eddie.  Gentlemen.  Hey, I don't know if y'all caught it yesterday, uh, but when y'all first started doing that  cell phone static thing, right off the bat, he said, hey, I know that button.  Oh, he did?  Yeah, he did kind of say, I know that button. 
[00:12:30]  Did we play it while he was in studio?  I think he did know that it was a sound effect.  Oh, I want to talk to the little fella now.  That's what he said.  Poor little fella.  I want to talk to the little fella.  Put him in his shoebox.  Take out some nuts and bolts and whatnot.  Wing nuts.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you, sir.  All right, gentlemen.  All right.  Uh, Coke Logic.  Ooh.  Hey, mid...  Oh, sorry.  Midges...  Midges versus mascots. 
[00:13:00]  Mascots win.  Yeah, I think the mascots win in this case.  Yeah.  Gary Coleman is just miserable.  He is a poor guy.  I think I've turned the corner with him.  I think we've got to try to help the little fella out.  I feel bad for him.  You do, right?  Jesus.  When he came in that day...  He walked in here like an old man.  He couldn't even walk, really.  And you said it.  He's what, 41?  41.  41.  And quite frankly, without being, you know, too morbid about it, I don't think the guy  was supposed to make it past, like, 20.  Oh, really?  To tell you the truth.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:13:30]  It was one of those, you know, he has one of those bad diseases.  Kidney failure and stuff like that, and, you know, he was little, so they put him on  that show.  But then it's one of those things where it's like, all right, kid can't...  It's like Chubsy-Ubsy back in the old Little Rascals days.  He didn't live too long.  No, he did not.  A little Chubsy-Ubsy.  He did not.  All right, well, we'll talk about the Gary Coleman thing a little more.  Borrowed time.  You think?  Yeah.  He's had a tough one, too. 
[00:14:00]  But he just had a...  He was a one-hit wonder.  Yeah, he was.  And at a very young age.  But he was the biggest TV star in the country.  Yeah, he was.  For a few years.  There was no one bigger than Gary Coleman for a few years.  Ironically, no one bigger.  Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da.  He himself, a physical stature.  Right.  Pretty small.  Yesterday also gave us Gallagher.  Yeah, Gallagher.  I went home just laughing all day long. 
[00:14:30]  I can't get enough of this Gallagher.  I understand a few of the faithfuls hated it.  Yeah.  In general, though, the feedback on Gallagher was really, really strong.  It really was.  You know what?  It doesn't have to...  To me, here's my opinion of the whole thing.  It doesn't have to be hysterically funny, because I didn't think it was.  I didn't think Gallagher was like, everything he said was funny.  Oh, no.  He's just so fucking weird that I was compelled to listen to his harebrained schemes, and just 
[00:15:00]  everything he was saying is just...  He's such a weirdo.  I felt like...  I love that word.  Weirdo.  Weirdo.  I love that word.  I felt like I was just talking and looking at a lunatic for two straight hours.  Yeah.  He's insane.  I don't know how he sleeps.  I don't know if it's drugs, adrenaline.  I have no idea.  I just picture him on his back staring at the ceiling, talking to himself about wacky  inventions.  Right.  And none of the inventions come to...  No. 
[00:15:30]  What's the word?  I tried it yesterday.  Yeah.  No, they don't.  He's just...  He keeps talking about this.  This one's going to pick it up.  He's going to talk to the mayor about some fucking Western thing, and dirt and sawdust in  the street and a bar.  But his Western...  What are you talking about?  But his Western idea, I really liked, because it brought me back to being a kid.  I don't remember where I was, but one of these shitty, like, wannabe Disney places.  Yeah.  They have the old Western show, and they come riding in on the horses, and someone gets 
[00:16:00]  shot and falls off the roof and hits the hay bales.  The Wild West show.  So when he was talking about it, visually, I was right there with him, because it brought  me back.  But then I was thinking, okay, Mayor Bloomberg is going to allow Gallagher to set up an old  Western show.  And I think he was saying Times Square.  It ain't...  Yeah, yeah.  Times Square.  And he needed dirt to be brought in.  And yeah, they're just going to cover the streets with enough dirt to make it kind of  look like an old Western town.  Hey, welcome to the Wild West show. 
[00:16:30]  Fantastic.  Here comes our villain.  He's riding in.  Look out.  Oh, no.  Wow.  There goes our hero.  It's just got to be fell off the top of that building.  Wow.  Look at that.  What do you think, people?  What do you think?  Yeah.  I hate those.  You could obviously tell he's falling on a mat with dirt on it.  Or they...  Like the dirt and rocks bounce with him.  Or they fall just out of sight.  Yeah, yeah.  Like there's a fence in the way, and he falls behind the fence, and you've got to know that 
[00:17:00]  there's something nice and fluffy behind the fence.  I know.  Those things stink.  I hate them.  I liked it when I was a kid.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He's going to sit there and watch that drivel in New York.  And then he came up...  I don't think he brought this up on the air, because we had to take breaks, unfortunately.  As soon as we went to break, he just continued.  So we missed out on a lot of great material for the listeners.  Yeah, he just goes on and on.  Because he's not one of those guys...  During breaks, just to take you inside the show, sometimes we'll have a guest on, and 
[00:17:30]  they'll keep talking, because that's what you do as humans, right?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, they might hit on something, and me and Ann will look at each other like,  oh, my God, you've got to say that on the air.  Yeah, save it for the air.  Save it for the air.  And then we go back on the air, and we make believe we didn't hear.  And then we set the guy up.  But with Gallagher, you know that that's impossible.  You can't stop it.  So all this shit he's saying during the commercial breaks is just going nowhere.  I mean, four people enjoyed it, unfortunately.  But his view on movies was amazing.  He talks about actresses and actors that take you out of the movie. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And his idea is really...  That wasn't on the air?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  His idea was simple.  Every actor and every actress should be in one movie.  One movie.  One movie, and then they're known for that one movie.  Yeah, because if you watch him in another movie, you're like, oh, I saw him in this other movie.  And then you realize it's an actor.  Right.  And that the movie isn't real, and it takes you out of it.  Right.  To a certain extent.  And so actors can only make one movie. 
[00:18:30]  Kind of like the idea.  Kind of like it.  Some people are suggesting he should have made one special.  I don't even...  Did you ever see a Gallagher special?  I don't even know.  Back in the 80s, it was huge.  Yeah, he was on Showtime all the time.  Was he like that during his specials?  I don't remember.  He had the beret kind of hat on.  No, I know that.  This is what I know.  Was he crazy like that?  Yeah.  He seemed a little more like his thoughts were together a little more. 
[00:19:00]  He was more polished.  Yeah, polished.  That's good.  Because what I remember about Gallagher, unfortunately, and he probably hates it, is the guy that smashes  the watermelon, and the guy is...  That was the finale.  Like, his whole show was, you know, over an hour long, and it was him with various inventions  and other things that he, you know, he'd have giant props on stage.  He's a prop comic.  Yeah, but I just remember when it got to the point where he started smashing shit.  He'd come out on roller skates. 
[00:19:30]  See, I don't remember any of this.  He'd be on roller skates like the entire show.  What's the point?  Or he came out on a tricycle once with a car door on it and rolled the window down and put  his arm out, and he's just kind of like...  He would do shit like that.  But the point I'm making is, he doesn't have to smash the watermelon.  No.  But I think his audience expects that, obviously.  But if you just heard him on stage just ranting and raving like he did on our show, that would  be a great, great night.  See, there's a little Gallagher.  I think this is his motor. 
[00:20:00]  They teach us how to be different.  They teach us how to be the same.  Right, guys?  Gang?  Girls?  Remember a school where you go to learn to communicate and all they say is no talking?  Makes no sense.  It stifles the creative person who has questions to ask.  Why are all the home ec teachers divorced?  I remember at the very beginning, nursery school seemed strange to me. 
[00:20:30]  I heard nursery rhyme about the three bears.  Okay.  Bear comes home, finds a blonde in his bed.  He's pissed off because he's out of a little porridge.  See, he's much the same.  But he's mellower.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, if he just rattled off shit like he does here, people would be sitting there drooling  in the audience wondering what the fuck he's talking about.  Dude, I'd go tomorrow.  Daddy, you saw him recently.  Does he rant and rave?  His show that I saw, I mean, he has some material that I guess is prepared or whatever, but 
[00:21:00]  a lot of that show, I mean, you could pretty much tell was just off the cuff.  He's just talking, you know, thoughts come in his head and they come out of his mouth.  He tries things with the audience that I don't think he ever tried before at a different show.  I love that.  I love guys like that.  Dude, you know what?  It sounds crazy to say, oh, I went to see Gallagher and it was really good.  But you know what?  It was really good.  It was really different.  It wasn't the typical, you know, going to see a comic thing.  Yeah, I think you should see him.  I think he's going to come back tomorrow. 
[00:21:30]  We want him to come back tomorrow.  And he told us on the way out, he's like, all right, yeah, I'll come back.  And he's like, I'm going to see a couple of Broadway shows and then I'm going to come  in and give you guys a review.  I'm like, all right.  But I mean, anyone else that says that to us, we go, get the fuck out of here.  Don't do that.  I'm going to see some Broadway shows.  Right.  But we just know it'll be good.  Yeah.  Even he'll be talking about two shows that no one will give a shit about.  Yeah.  The content of what he says, no one will give a shit about. 
[00:22:00]  But how he says it.  Oh, let me go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  Hey, Charlie.  Morning, buh-buh-boys.  Good morning, Charles.  Hey, Gallagher was great.  I mean, like Andy said, a lot of it isn't, you know, gut-busting funny, but, you know,  he gets you thinking.  The thing I enjoyed yesterday, I cannot wait to be first in line to get my Yowboy hat.  Yeah.  It's like the Wild Wild West in China. 
[00:22:30]  His Yowboy hat.  I forgot about the Yowboy hat.  And that was when he kind of first came in, a little early in his appearance.  There was so much shit he rattled off.  I forgot about the Yowboy hat.  How much material do you think he did?  Ah, it was nonstop for hours.  How many thought starters did he have?  Thought starters.  That's all he had.  Right.  Not one thing was finished.  Right.  Just like his inventions.  Yeah, his inventions. 
[00:23:00]  He's a crazy person.  Dude, I would love to get a tour of his house.  It's got to be just where a lunatic lives.  Yeah.  Like a hoarder.  A crazy hoarder.  It has to be one of those houses that have paths.  Yeah, because he said he's got all his props.  He's got a friggin' foam rubber steamroller.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's got that big giant couch that he had.  What was the couch all about?  He had a giant...  Oh, somebody's calling about that?  Another Charlie.  Another Charlie from...  No, this is Charlie. 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  They say Charlie in Philly and Charlie up here in New York.  Staten Island, actually.  What's up, Charlie?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, the couch was a trampoline.  And he used to jump from one side of it to the other and do tricks off it.  Yeah, true.  Oh, my God.  That was his giant couch.  He pulled things out of it.  Yeah, I guess we don't have to watch Gallagher clips, but there's the huge couch.  Yeah.  And he'd find things in the couch like you would at home.  But there are giant things that he would find in the couch. 
[00:24:00]  Hey, I mean, what does it take to build...  See, a potato chip.  What does it take to build these props?  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  Big crayon.  You know what?  I'm going to watch Gallagher clips later today.  Yeah.  Dude, in the 80s, if you had showtime, you were watching fucking Gallagher when he came on.  And now he's just playing clubs.  And now he's doing clubs.  He was playing.  He was huge. 
[00:24:30]  He was huge.  Giant specials filling fucking huge halls.  Right.  Hey, Danny brought in a clip.  Gallagher pwns his opener.  What is this about?  I think one of my Facebook friends sent this to me yesterday.  And I started watching it.  And basically, it's during the now era of Gallagher where he's back doing the clubs again after all these years.  And his opener was just failing miserably.  And so Gallagher just decides to step in and try and help him out. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, this kid was obviously new and very annoyed.  I just thought it was very funny.  Okay.  Very, very funny.  So, yeah, Gallagher's opener.  First comic up is just having a hard time on that stage.  And this is how it goes down.  Yeah, this first clip is just about a solid minute of this kid bombing before Gallagher steps in.  All right, cool.  It's been pretty much, so I'm just going to throw a time here.  The climax is kind of weird.  You kind of feel obligated to do it almost.  You're like, no, here we go.  Got a time for this guy. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, give him a little, man.  Yeah.  Let's get him.  God, you know, have you ever seen, like, have you ever been to a show or a concert where they're like,  Hey, have you ever been to a show or a concert where they say,  Hey, put your hands together for so-and-so?  Put your hands together?  Really?  Are we to the point where we don't even know how to clap?  Are there really people going, wait a minute?  Ah, so close. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, only are you the secret?  Oh, put your hands together, you say.  I might try that.  Works out pretty well.  But, you know, they add a lot of sayings like that.  One of the things that you kind of feel obligated to say or do, you know, they'll be like things like,  You lost them.  So he goes, he just walks on stage, he goes, you lost them. 
[00:26:30]  Gallagher looking like a mad scientist.  Shit, like Doc Brown.  Yeah, like Doc Brown.  Walks up to the mic really slowly and just goes, you lost them.  You lost them.  Wow, that's harsh.  I mean, I can't imagine like being, trying to break into comedy.  And look, whether you like him or hate him, Gallagher is, he's a, I mean, everybody knows Gallagher.  He's a legend.  He's a comic legend, if you will.  So to have Gallagher just interrupt you and tell you how terrible you're doing.  You lost them.  And the comic, he's some skinny guy, just is standing there with his hands on his hips now, 
[00:27:00]  looking at Gallagher like, what do I do?  He's lost.  You lost them.  Amazing.  I don't know, but I'll introduce you and then you come out.  Don't go too far.  Don't go real far.  Because they want to see you.  Think a second.  So now Gallagher takes over the mic and the guy walks off stage and that's where Gallagher  obviously just said, don't go too far. 
[00:27:30]  They want to see you.  Yeah.  So I guess he's going to give the kids some advice.  Think a second time about what the first joke you're going to do is.  And get them good.  Don't tell the long story.  It's a how you make pickle bread dildo.  Something short.  To get them rolling.  And then do that long shit later.  But it is fun to talk about clapping because it was introduced at the beginning when you 
[00:28:00]  first came up.  But they're too quiet.  You need to get them going.  Right?  Okay.  So what was your name again?  Because they said something about being flexible.  And I thought you were going to come out and do a little contortion.  Didn't you think that?  We thought you were going to do a little contortion.  What does that flexibility have to do with the fact that you'll let other comedians have  the mic during your set? 
[00:28:30]  I'm just helping.  Wow.  He's killing them.  He's hosing them.  He's killing them.  And then what?  He brings the guy back out.  Yeah.  So he's going to now reintroduce this opener to do a set.  And the kid just starts bombing.  What was your first name again?  Hey there.  Eric.  Good.  That's a good Viking name.  And people from around here are descended from the Vikings.  We don't have a lot of like French bags.  So they're there. 
[00:29:00]  Come on.  Get ready.  Are you thinking about that first joke?  You're ready?  You're sitting.  That's not like writing.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage for the first time you haven't seen him before.  Eric.  Fantastic.  Thank you. 
[00:29:30]  So.  How are you doing?  Well, I was actually, you know, just thinking that when somebody introduces you and then you do what you're at comedy act and then somebody interrupts you, it says it's kind of lose your train of thought.  All right.  All right.  Now tell a joke. 
[00:30:00]  Tell a joke.  They have to come up and tell a joke first.  Then do a longer talk.  Did you want to go on stage now?  No.  I could.  What did he say?  He goes, you want to go on stage now?  Oh, wow.  Like he's, he's, he's so fucked up at this point.  He's out of his mind.  He's out of his mind.  I don't want to stage now.  I could, I could, how about you do the open and then I'll do the hour long smash and he'll look first.  And then we'll be okay.  No, I do an hour long of talking and you didn't smash you first. 
[00:30:30]  That's okay.  Wow.  He, uh, he's, he's schooling that young gentleman.  Mm-hmm.  That guy had no clue what to do after that.  Oh, well, I, too, by the way.  So.  So.  How many, how many?  I was, I was thinking.  I had to rewind that a hundred times.  He just has no idea where he's going with his old thought.  Dummy.  Hi, this is an honor. 
[00:31:00]  I want to be introduced by the Gallagher.  Please.  Okay.  Give me one more shot.  One more shot.  All right.  Um, why don't little girls fart?  They don't get assholes till they get married. 
[00:31:30]  It's not coming up.  He's got his book out.  There's all Heather.  This is a good thing to talk about at the beginning also, is that people's names, then you can refer to them.  See, what I do is I set things up.  When I talk about old men.  When I talk about old men, I'll mention Virgil.  When I want to talk about little sissy ships, I mention laughs. 
[00:32:00]  And there's always room for a couple of horrors in a nightclub.  He's killing.  He's killing.  He's killing.  He's killing.  He's killing.  He's killing.  Yeah.  He's killing that poor little fuck is just sitting there.  And then finally, Gallagher, well, his advice might work here, finally.  Yeah, the kid finally decides, you know, I think he gets through his head that he can't start out with this long soliloquy to start his set with. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we always want to support anybody that wants to go in this terrible business of entertaining alcoholics.  So we encourage this young man coming to the stage right now with a good Viking Norwegian name, Eric.  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Did you hear that there was a guy with no arms, no legs?  That he was thrown out of a truck?  I had to call him Skip.  Jesus, horrible joke.  That's awful.  But they laughed.  At the end, they laughed.  They came out with some energy.  Right.  One-liner. 
[00:33:30]  God damn.  He's the greatest guy in the world because he just doesn't care.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He'll walk up in the middle of your set.  Yeah.  He'll just start rambling off any thought in his head.  The guy's great.  He's terrific.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Just getting started today.  Bob Kelly's coming back.  Bobby.  Gallagher pretty much took a lot of his time.  Yesterday.  So we invited Bob Kelly to come back.  And Patrice O'Neill is going to be here in about an hour.  Oh, Patrice coming in today, too?  Patrickey will be here.  Bob Kelly will be here. 
[00:34:00]  And then tomorrow, I think it's Patrice and Gallagher coming back.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow for the grand finale.  Patrice and Gallagher.  We can take the day off.  Oh, shit.  All righty, then.  We can take the day off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Talk about not being able to get a word in it.  Holy shit.  That is going to be a battle tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Stay there.  David Letterman in trouble, actually.  Kicking it old school. 
[00:34:30]  Coming back.  Come on.  You know the band.  I remember this from the old days.  From the...  From the...  From the...  Wow, I almost forgot the slogan.  From the...  From the...  Wait, what is it?  From the only station that really rocks.  From the only station that really rocks.  Well, this doesn't really rock.  It's just a cool song.  And this mind is from the...  Exactly.  I hate that.  When I want to know the words, but I just... 
[00:35:00]  Just don't know them.  And you got to just kind of...  In the meantime...  Oh, my God.  So what?  Letterman's in trouble?  What happened?  Our old pal Letterman.  This is not a rerun.  Hey, Dave.  Is all forgiven with us and you or what?  When are we coming back on your show? 
[00:35:30]  That would be nice.  Boy, that was a dumb decision we made two years ago, huh?  Oh, God.  Was that stupid?  Let's burn a fucking sure thing bridge.  With a show that we can walk to.  We?  There's no mistake about it.  We are the dumbest guys in broadcasting.  Yes, we are.  I believe we put on a fine show every day, but let's not be mistaken.  We are the dumbest guys in radio.  Two dummies.  I remember being in a hotel room. 
[00:36:00]  Fox Hollow, matter of fact.  I was doing a Long Island visit and I happened to go to the Fox Hollow somewhere out there  in Long Island.  I live in Decimal Point.  Shut it.  And I'm on the phone with Anthony.  I'm on the phone with Super Agent Bob Eatman.  Yeah.  A month earlier, we had an amazing Letterman appearance to the point where one of the big  honchos, one of the big producers comes running in right after our appearance and said,  Oh, my God.  You guys were great.  That was a great appearance. 
[00:36:30]  We're really, really happy and we want to book you.  Have you back.  We want to have you back sooner than later.  Yeah.  And then she walks off.  And then the boys that we know over there, some of the writers, they're like, that never  happens.  Oh, my God.  That never happens.  It was very cool.  All right.  So we're feeling pretty good about ourselves.  Now, if you fast forward, it's about Christmas time and I'm in the hotel.  I'm talking to Ann.  I'm talking to Super Agent Bob Eatman.  Now we have a decision to make because Leno wants us to fly out to L.A. like two days before 
[00:37:00]  Christmas and do his show, which we ended up doing with The Killers.  Yes, we did.  And drinking margaritas and Matthew McConaughey.  It was just an amazing, an amazing night.  Yes, yes, yes.  I remember Anthony looking at me right before he went on stage and said, don't forget this  moment.  You were out of your mind like, holy shit, is this cool?  It's a biggie.  And Letterman, at the time, didn't have a date booked for our return.  No.  So then we said yes to Leno. 
[00:37:30]  This is how it went down.  I hope David is listening right now.  This is really how it went down.  Yeah, Dave's listening.  I think he's sleeping.  I know.  I'm just trying to make it good for the radio.  So we didn't have a date for Letterman and Leno said, we really want you guys.  So we agreed to Leno and then Letterman's people said, fuck that.  We want you on that exact same day.  And now we're like, we already said yes to Leno.  Yeah.  He seems to be kind of cool.  And he was plugging, giving us some plugs and the relationship with Jimmy and that. 
[00:38:00]  So we kind of went out to L.A.  Went out to L.A.  And did that.  And we haven't heard from the Letterman people since.  Flame on!  We could have been on our like sixth or eighth appearance by now.  I know, I know.  You know.  Dummies.  We had that crowd going.  Oh, we're so stupid.  Remember us and the tennis balls?  Of course.  I still have a couple of those.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:38:30]  Did we fuck up?  We are just.  Yeah, we're stupid.  We really are stupid.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  But Letterman's in trouble, Ant?  What did he do now?  I'll be honest.  I did not know this was going on.  And I guess he did a joke on the transgender, transgender employee that Obama hired.  That Obama appointed.  Yeah.  I finally saw a picture of her it, he thing.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Yeah.  Well, it.  From a distance, I'm saying.  Not bad.  I have no desire to go sniffing around.  He used to have a cock. 
[00:39:00]  True.  He used to have a cock.  True.  But not bad.  I think they're figuring out that surgery is what I'm getting at.  And then the whole thing I hear is, you know, it, whatever it is, I don't even know what  to call it, says, well, you know, and then they got it.  They can't just say, hey, thanks for the gig.  Good.  You know, I'll do the job to the best of my ability.  It's got to turn into this.  And I hope this opens the doors for more transgendered people in government.  Shut up. 
[00:39:30]  Give us a shit.  There's only another hundred of you out there.  If you ask me, if you want to cut your dick off, there's something a little fucking amiss  inside that perhaps, you know, you're not, I don't think you should be in charge of shit.  That's my personal opinion.  Remember when I said not bad?  Yeah.  Bad.  Dude, that's a guy.  It's a guy with a wig.  I just got another glimpse.  A guy with a wig trying to look all fucking.  The picture I saw had some kind of fucking, the famous like Facebook, like voodoo thing happening. 
[00:40:00]  That thing is trying to be demure.  Now the picture, okay, real bad.  The big hands, those big man hands.  Wow.  Who does that thing look like?  A guy?  Trying to look like a girl?  Yeah.  It's a guy with some kind of fucking wispy red hair and it just, I don't like, no.  You know what they have to do to these transgenders? 
[00:40:30]  They got to figure out how to.  A head transplant?  Well, I mean, they're almost figuring that out.  But the dead giveaway, they got to chop off their hands.  Oh, you're thinking.  Because the one picture, the thing has the hands on her, like her knee.  Yeah.  And they're huge man hands and now there's like long nails on them.  Oh, is that the thing?  Oh, let's hear.  Let's hear the system.  Let's hear the voice.  Ten years ago, she transitioned her gender and has been in the public eye ever since.  Oh, that's not your thoughts.  A staunch advocate of civil rights, Amanda has consulted and advised numerous employers 
[00:41:00]  across the country on transgender issues.  She was acknowledged by the Tucson YWCA in 2004 as a recipient of the Woman on the Move  Award and by the Arizona Human Rights Fund in 2005 as their individual honoree.  Amanda is on the board of directors of Out and Equal Workplace Advocates and the National  Death Center for Transgender Equality.  She's a divorced parent sharing custody of a 13-year-old son. 
[00:41:30]  Our second guest is C. Michael Woodward, who has led...  I just want to hear her talk.  ...a Arizona gender alliance for five years.  ...transgender's of his life...  ...and those different types of...  All right, now that's a girl that became a guy?  That's who your brain psychologically...  Wait, that used to be a girl?  ...gender expression.  And then...  I think that's how the intro did.  Now, within the...  Oh, we just wanted to hear her.  We had a bit more...  Where's her?  I know.  Well...  What the hell is this?  All right, here we go. 
[00:42:00]  There you go.  ...people in the drag culture who are performers, and both drag queens and drag queens, who present  themselves for the sake of entertainment and do representation for the people.  Those people...  Lily!  Lily!  Lily, I want my dick cut off, Lily!  Ha, ha!  Grandpa!  Grandpa, do you have a potion that'll cut my dick off?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Now, Eddie, I'm gonna be...  You're gonna have two mommies, Eddie. 
[00:42:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Here's Spot!  Spot, burn my dick off!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  You know...  I could cut your dick off, Hyman!  Hyman!  ...patients that society has picked, you know, that you're either masculine or feminine,  and they tend to either mix some of...  You know what?  The voice, not bad.  She...  It...  Whatever it is.  It's trying very hard.  More of an androgynous.  More of an androgynous. 
[00:43:00]  More than...  Androgynous.  Something with this.  Androgynous.  So the S's...  The S's are usually a dead giveaway with trannies, too.  Right, right.  Because they can't keep that feminine thing...  So she's like this...  I think she keeps her teeth, like, closed so the, uh...  The Adam's apple doesn't do its job.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that makes it happen.  Yeah, that voice.  The big, deep voice.  Uh, yeah, let's say hi to Brian in Pennsylvania.  Brian!  Hey, my only one noticed this girl's name is Amanda. 
[00:43:30]  Ha, Amanda.  Duh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Hey, not bad!  Gallagher would be happy with you.  Yeah.  You came on, you fucking...  I had the joke, it was all there.  You're funny.  Formally known as Brian from the Poconos, if you remember me.  Sure.  No, we don't.  Yeah, I remember him.  He used to call from the heart-shaped tubs.  No, no, no.  I was the guy that, uh, that screwed up and you had a ton of screw-ups.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  All right, Brian.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  See, you ruined it.  I know, you ruined my line. 
[00:44:00]  That was just a dumb little throwaway.  Thanks.  Oh, my God.  Why didn't we come up with that, though?  A man, duh.  A man, duh.  Look who's, uh, on the phone.  Wow, did we get the stars.  Oh, who?  Larry King.  Oh, Larry?  Yeah.  Larry!  Hey!  Gentlemen, how important is the dick?  How important is the dick?  Apparently not very important.  Nah.  In the Obama administration.  What, uh, what is the job title that, uh, this thing has for Obama?  Um, uh, uh, uh, Secretary of Cock? 
[00:44:30]  Secretary...  That would be ironic.  She's got to be some kind of secretary, because that's got to be, um...  That's what broads do.  They just do...  The Tranny Czar?  Secretary stuff.  The Tranny Czar.  Uh, I don't know.  You want to...  The...  I don't have any nuts anymore.  Yeah.  Um, who knows?  I can't even...  Could you imagine fucking taking your dick off?  Hmm.  Dude.  No.  I can't.  What the fuck would you play with? 
[00:45:00]  I don't want to do that.  Half the day.  Senior...  Technical...  Technical...  Advisor...  To the president?  Is there...  To the president?  To dick removal.  Senior...  Advisor...  Department of Commerce.  What?  What does that do?  She's...  She...  She's losing her own goods, and she's supposed to be...  Yeah, the Department of Commerce.  Commerce?  She's outsourcing her dick.  Right.  You're supposed to keep your goods.  Keep your dick. 
[00:45:30]  Well, Letterman's in trouble.  Human Rights Coalition asking Letterman to apologize for joke involving Obama's new  transgender employee and his announcer.  Well, here's something interesting.  President Obama has appointed a transgender person.  A transgender person.  Her name is Amanda Simpson, and he has appointed her to become a part of the Commerce Department.  We have a photo.  Here she is right there.  Yeah, that's Amanda Simpson.  What?  And she's a transgender...  Amanda?  What?  Amanda used to be a dude?  Oh, my God! 
[00:46:00]  Letterman's in trouble for that.  Why?  What?  That's a great joke.  Yeah, it's funny.  That's an honest joke.  That's a reaction everyone has.  Yes.  So, some human rights...  The Human Rights Coalition, I guess, wants Letterman to apologize.  He's not going to start apologizing for everything, is he?  No, no.  I kind of understand that he had to do the right thing with, what, that Sarah Palin? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Had to do that.  Look at this guy.  I love this.  The inmate escape.  Look at him.  He's fucks him with his handcuffs, and then he just takes off.  That's live?  Yeah, that's great.  His convict just runs off of the chain.  That is video of the day.  He got out of his handcuffs.  So, what, they're doing the perp walk, basically?  Yeah.  All the guys, were they leaving the courthouse?  Walking them from the courthouse to the old paddy wagon, I guess. 
[00:47:00]  And they're all in chains.  Why was the news crew out there?  I don't know.  They must have just been out there to get a clip of somebody.  It must mean that there was a big shot on the chain.  So, you see him futzing with his handcuffs that are connected to the chain, and then he  kind of looks around, just slips it, and runs, and then a bunch of cops just run  after him, and they wound up catching him.  They got him?  Yeah, they apprehended him.  Oh, that sucks.  Boy, was he running, though.  And then a bunch of rats on the chain gang. 
[00:47:30]  Right when the cops came running out, a bunch of the guys on the chain gang were like,  he made a right, he made a right, go down there and follow him.  Like, that's going to help their cause.  They're helping him out.  Let him go.  It's really low, Dad.  Good evening, I'm Sade Bedard-Noir.  And I'm dying to work with you.  Sade Bedard-Noir.  How about you change the name?  Newsreader.  Right outside a police precinct, right in front of officers.  And I would assume his camera was the only one to catch the getaway.  Joe Torres is live on Staten Island with the exclusive video. 
[00:48:00]  Joe?  Sade, the bottom line, the handcuff was too loose.  That seems to explain how it was that an armed robbery suspect escaped from police custody  here at the steps of the 120th precinct.  He wasn't armed anymore.  No, he's an armed robbery suspect.  I know, but you see how they kind of...  Yeah, they kind of scare you.  ...the entire daring stunt on tape.  Stunt.  Maquan Thompson is wearing a black jacket over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  Look at him.  Look at him getting out of it.  ...as the 22-year-old slips out of his handcuff, ducks under a police chain... 
[00:48:30]  Run, homie, run.  And there he goes.  Look at the brother go.  That's awesome.  ...around the corner before stunned police officers begin their chase.  Between the time that he left the steps and got to the corner, it was probably less than  four seconds.  He was so fast, so incredibly fast.  Oh, he was very fast.  Incredibly fast?  He wasn't incredibly fast.  Just a dude running. 
[00:49:00]  He's running, man.  But they got him, huh?  Whoever put those cuffs on, man.  Dan, where's that video?  It's going to roll.  People want it immediately.  Uh, it's on a lot of news sources this morning, but if you go to Google News and just put  in Prisoner Escape, it's the first thing that comes up.  Pretty much the first thing.  All right, there you go.  You can find that guy.  I'm out of here, yo.  So what do you think of Letterman?  No, apology necessary.  We've got to hold our ground.  Yeah.  People that are in the business of funny, whether you're a comedian or what have you, we all 
[00:49:30]  have to just stand our ground.  Dave has weathered a pretty big storm, uh, as far as that, um, you know.  The Sour Palin thing?  No, no, no.  Well, that was, was something.  Well, that was his...  But then, that wasn't it.  No, with the chick, you know?  With the, uh, you know, sex thing.  Uh-huh.  Uh, that was pretty big.  He, he addressed it, and it went away.  Um, he doesn't have to.  He's in a position now where he could just, he could just say, fuck you now. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I think he will, too.  He did, he did his apologizing for other stuff, so he kind of, he has a past now.  And that's a great joke.  Yeah.  I wonder if one of our, uh, boys wrote that one.  That's a good one.  Did one of our boys write that one?  Probably.  They'll tweet me if they did.  They'll say yes.  It's a, it's a great, uh, it's a great way to look at it, the whole situation.  Hey, Ann, speaking of tweeting, uh, you had a fine tweet last night.  Tweet.  Yes.  Your, your gun stat, your, your, uh... 
[00:50:30]  Yes.  Homicide stat.  Yeah.  You made a lot of sense, uh, with your tweet last night.  And I gotta be honest with you.  I really do.  Apparently, FBI records, uh, that came out, uh, indicate that, um, murder, way down.  Way down.  Across the country?  For 2009.  Uh, yes.  Across the country in general.  And in New York.  Well, New York, lowest murder rate since 1963, I believe.  But I, we know they fudge with the stats a little bit.  Yeah, murder's hard to fudge.  Yeah.  Murder's hard. 
[00:51:00]  That was my second part of what I was about to say.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  I was setting myself up.  But murder is hard to fudge.  You're right.  Like, robbery, they can fudge it, they can turn it into, you know, I've heard stories  where robberies are committed, and, you know, obviously the, the police commissioners and  everything want the robbery stats down.  Right.  So they go, all right, we'll call it something else.  Sure.  We'll say it's, you know, a petty larceny.  Sure.  Or something like that, and, and it makes the stats look like they dropped down.  Murder's kind of hard to call something else. 
[00:51:30]  Sure.  Stats are very just.  Deceiving.  Deceiving.  Yeah.  Useless.  For whatever purpose you need them for.  Suspicious.  They could be twisted, turned, manipulated.  Yeah, don't believe stats.  But, um, when Obama started his run for presidency, and especially when it really looked like he was  going to win this thing, and obviously he did, a lot of people, because of his anti-gun  stance, bought guns, thinking that, uh, and still thinking, believe me, it's still a danger, 
[00:52:00]  that they're not going to be able to buy guns, that there's going to be all kinds of new  gun laws put in place, and, uh, uh, the assault weapons bans, and, um, pistol, uh, permits,  things like that.  Um, so a lot of people started buying guns, and in the time that people started buying  guns, the crime rate dropped.  Yeah, there's no way around it.  I mean, 2009, Obama was in office, and we heard all the guns.  You heard all the stories saying, how many times did you open the paper, or watch the 
[00:52:30]  news and say, wow, gun sales through the roof?  There's a couple things going on here, too.  2009 was a rough year for a lot of people.  Yep.  And when you're having a rough year, economically, in the country, usually crime is way up, and  murder's way up.  Yeah.  So, 2009 should have been a pretty impressive year.  Yep, for, uh, for murder.  For that type of thing.  And, uh, crime in general.  And the fact that gun stores were, during a recession, were seeing record sales. 
[00:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  I mean, people were actually spending money that they really didn't have to, uh, arm themselves.  Uh, and then crime drops.  Mm-hmm.  And this goes against all the babble you hear from the gun control people saying, more guns  only means more murders, more crime.  And it doesn't.  When you're talking about guns in the hands of responsible, law-abiding, uh, law-abiding  citizens, uh, it, it does make, uh, places safer.  Right.  It just, it's, it's, it's, and it's, it's been that way. 
[00:53:30]  Stats have shown it over the years.  Some of the most dangerous places in the entire, uh, country are places that have the strictest  gun laws.  You look at a place like, uh, Chicago, you're not even allowed to have a gun in Chicago.  Right.  Chicago is, is Beirut.  It's crime central.  D.C., same thing.  They're still working on that, but.  No.  Only if you're an NBA player.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Apparently. 
[00:54:00]  On a team that used to be called the Bullets, by the way.  Oops.  Change the name of the team, but make sure you hire questionable players.  That's why the whole system is fucked up.  So stupid.  Yeah.  But it just, uh, I, I like to see how the, the gun control, the gun law, the gun, you  know, uh, people are going to try to spin this.  Well, you said last night on your tweet too, why isn't this on CNN?  Yeah, yeah.  Show it on CNN.  I would like to see a nice discussion on, uh, one of, one of the channels. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  CNN, MSNBC, Fox, one of them take it on and go, wow, this is a little weird.  Gun sales way up.  The economy sucked last year, but, uh, the murder rate way down.  Let them really break the numbers down and, and, and show it.  And perhaps, you know, maybe they could twist it around in a certain way where it, uh, looks,  you know, completely the opposite of what I'm saying.  Why isn't Wolf doing something on this?  Where's the situation?  This is a situation we need to discuss.  Get it in the situation room.  Wolf Blitzer.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Keith Olbermann. 
[00:55:00]  Yuck.  Yuck.  Sean Hannity.  Hannity, I was watching last night.  I don't want to say yuck, because I like the guy.  Oh, I like Hannity.  He was, he's a pisser.  He was going off on Obama last night.  We have clips of it.  Oh, by the way, I don't really agree with Hannity.  I just like him.  Yeah.  But I'm not an Obermann guy.  Trust me.  No.  And I was, oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  There's too much shit going on in my head right now.  What were you saying?  Because then I have something on Obermann.  The Obama thing and the, uh, healthcare, uh, reform bill that, uh, they're discussing. 
[00:55:30]  They, you know, you gotta get the House and the Senate to, uh, uh, compromise on, on what's going on.  So there'll be talks.  Mm-hmm.  Now, a lot of these talks that they're having about the healthcare bill involve a lot of taxpayer money going to certain states for favors in, in exchange for a yes vote.  And, uh, which really, uh, stinks, uh, thousands of pages.  So you can't read these things.  But the best way for people to keep informed about this would be to turn on C-SPAN or something like that. 
[00:56:00]  Is there a more boring channel than C-SPAN?  Dull.  Dull as all hell.  That's a question for the listeners right now.  Dull.  New York One is pretty fucking boring.  Yeah, yeah.  A little local news thing here in New York City, but C-SPAN.  C-SPAN is a bore fest.  And then, oh no, there is one that's worse than C-SPAN.  Worst channel on cable TV.  You got it?  CNET?  No.  C-SPAN 2.  C-SPAN 2.  Wow, that's like ESPN 2.  Right, C-SPAN 2. 
[00:56:30]  C-SPAN 2.  All the stuff they feel like shouldn't be on C-SPAN.  Like, that's not good enough for C-SPAN.  C-SPAN is a fucking bore fest.  That's not exciting enough for C-SPAN.  Oh my God.  The thing is, like, yeah, C-SPAN is a bore fest, but what the Democrats want to do is  not have the Republicans in on these compromise talks between the House and the Senate on  the health care bill, and have them behind closed doors.  And this is coming from an administration that said they were transparent, they were 
[00:57:00]  going to absolutely, step by step, especially with the health care, let the public see what's  happening, let them see what deals are being made, and what this health care package is  going to be all about, and then they come out and say, this is going to be private, behind  closed doors, no Republicans, and no television.  Now, you might say, all right, well, at least they didn't say it was going to be public.  Like, President Obama, eight times during his campaign, said that these very talks would 
[00:57:30]  be on C-SPAN, would be on C-SPAN, literally he said, it will be on C-SPAN.  So people can check it out.  And that fucking Pelosi piece of shit just goes, well, you know, a lot of things are said  during the campaign.  She actually said that.  How did Obama not just smack her face?  Well, you know, because what she's saying, in essence, is, well, he lied. 
[00:58:00]  He lied during his campaign to get elected, which is, you know, the truth.  Right.  But, which is funny, because some people are saying it's the first time, you know, Pelosi's  actually said something that was true.  But Obama, eight times, said it would be, it'll be on C-SPAN.  And C-SPAN has said, we will broadcast it, we'll take care of any expense, any problems  in broadcasting this will be on our lap.  And they said, no.  Now, how are we supposed to know? 
[00:58:30]  And I'm not saying everyone's going to sit and watch C-SPAN, believe me.  But at least the news will take the clips, the important, the backdoor deals.  They'll give you some highlights.  And let us know what we're dealing with as far as this health care bill goes.  But they want it signed immediately.  They can't get this fucking thing through fast enough because they don't want it stretching  out until the next election, where, believe me, I think a lot of Democrats are going to  fall to the wayside.  But my whole job, as you continue with this, my whole thought on this is simple. 
[00:59:00]  Both sides do this crap.  Oh, I know.  It's the Democrats' turn.  That's all.  You know what, though?  They all do this behind-the-scenes, backdoor dealing, wheeling and dealing.  Absolutely right.  All that bullshit.  Bush did it.  Bush had fucking backdoor deals that were just...  It's just Obama's turn, is all I'm saying.  It's worse, though, because Bush never said, I'm going to show you this shit.  So it's getting worse.  It's worse.  If you don't show it, it's one thing.  If you say eight fucking times during the campaign that you're going to open this up 
[00:59:30]  to the public and then don't, it looks very shady.  Do we have the montage?  I think we do.  It looks very fucking shady.  Here's the montage of Obama promising the health care debates will be televised.  And as you listen to this, remember, they will not.  They will be behind closed doors.  You will not know what deals they're making with each other.  Not negotiating behind closed doors, but bringing all parties together and broadcasting those 
[01:00:00]  negotiations on C-SPAN so that the American people can see what the choices are.  Because part of what we have to do is enlist the American people in this process.  I would put my plan forward and I would welcome input and say, here are my goals.  Reduce costs.  Increase quality coverage for everybody.  If you have better ideas, please present them.  But these negotiations will be on C-SPAN.  And so the public will be part of the conversation and we'll see the choices that are being made. 
[01:00:30]  You know, I respect what the Clintons tried to do in 1993 in moving health reform forward.  But they made one really big mistake.  And that is they took all their people and all their experts into a room and then they closed the door.  We will work on this process publicly.  It will be on C-SPAN.  It will be streaming over the net.  We'll have the negotiations televised on C-SPAN so that people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their constituents 
[01:01:00]  and who are making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies.  But here's the thing.  We're going to do all these negotiations on C-SPAN.  So the American people will be able to watch these negotiations.  Drug and insurance companies will have a seat at the table.  They just won't be able to buy every single chair.  And we will have a public process performing this plan.  It will be televised on C-SPAN.  I can't guarantee it will be exciting. 
[01:01:30]  So not everybody is going to be watching.  But it will be transparent and accountable to the American people.  The drug and insurance companies are still going to have a lot of power in Washington.  And they're still going to try to plot where forms are taking place.  So that's why I said, for example, that I want the negotiations to be taking place on C-SPAN.  So I'll put forward my plan.  But what I'll say is, look, if you've got better ideas, I'm happy to listen to them. 
[01:02:00]  But all this will be done on C-SPAN.  In front of the public.  And no, it won't.  Another one of these fucking change, transparency in the administration, promises that he made during the campaign.  Broken.  Thank you.  With that, let's go to Eric in Florida.  Eric, what do you got on this?  Hey, man.  What's up, man?  What's up, Bo?  Hey, buddy.  Hi.  Listen, man. 
[01:02:30]  I think you're a total hypocrite.  All right.  Explain.  What about when Tom DeLay and the other guy frisked, you know, from Tennessee?  Yep.  When all these guys were in charge, how many backroom broker deals did you hear about?  Zero.  Because you never saw them because they were in the dark.  I know.  What I'm saying is they never said that it was going to be transparent.  I never said that it's right to do this backdoor shit.  And the Republicans, of course they did it.  I'm not a hypocrite.  I'm agreeing with you. 
[01:03:00]  Yes, they did do it.  But this motherfucker said, how many times did you hear that?  It was going to be open to the public.  We are going to be able to see the negotiations.  Well, you actually did see the negotiations if you watched C-SPAN.  Bullshit.  Actually, by the way, hey, listen, hold on.  What?  C-SPAN 3 is actually the worst channel because one is the house, two is the Senate, three  is all the other extraneous.  They have three?  C-SPAN 3.  Wow.  Yeah.  They have three.  I'm waiting for the Ocho.  We got a couple more candidates for worse than eight. 
[01:03:30]  We got a couple more candidates for worse cable channel, believe it or not, that we're going  to go to in a second.  But finish up, Eric.  What I was going to say was, you know, they did have open hearings in the House and in  the Senate.  And I know it's a boring-ass channel to watch, but if you're bored and you go to sleep, you  know, there was your public forum whereby things were streaming on C-SPAN as well as  on the web.  No, no, this is, where's the transparency now, though, when the House and the Senate are  going to hash out and try to get a compromise between the two bills?  And this is a very important process because this is where those favors start going back 
[01:04:00]  and forth and tax money is doled out to fucking different states for favors, for votes.  And we're not going to be able to hear this until, you know, this bill comes out and they  go, the bill's here, sign it, and it's thousands of pages that we know nothing about.  That, to me, and with him saying that many times that this process will be available for  viewing by the public is a ridiculous and an outright campaign lie that he said was not 
[01:04:30]  going to happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they all fucking lie, so that's why I'm with Eric.  Well, I know, but you know something?  Thank you, Eric.  I'm with you.  They all fucking lie, but this motherfucker is the guy that said he's not lying.  He's a president.  Well, we're on fucking satellite.  I can say what we want.  Call him a mofo.  All right, this mofo, he's the one that said, this is a big change. 
[01:05:00]  This is change, man.  This is a whole thing.  This was a guy that was brought in, and he got elected.  He got elected because it was supposed to be this giant change.  No more old white guys.  Oh, it's going to be great.  We're going to have this new, young black guy in the White House, and he's got such hope.  And things will finally be different.  No, they won't.  He did say no more business as usual. 
[01:05:30]  He did say that.  Yeah, no more business as usual.  You're going to see a new Washington and the transparency.  And him and Pelosi just suck.  They lied.  Well, I think as a voter, if you truly, honestly believe that kind of rhetoric, you're an idiot.  All right.  Let me go to Glenn.  Obviously, a lot of idiots.  All right, hold on.  Glenn in New York wants to argue with Eric in Florida.  I like when the listeners get going.  We got a banter?  Yeah.  A little banter.  Let's go.  This is like, you know, what they do in Fox.  You get a few banter. 
[01:06:00]  Go ahead, Glenn.  Good morning.  I want to call it the great, great, great American panel.  Love it.  That sounds familiar.  It really does.  Eric, how stupid are you?  Okay, they want you, me, everybody to pay for everybody else's health care when it's just a big crack of shit.  All they're doing is getting $300 million for this state.  They're just buying everybody's fucking votes.  And airhead fuckers like you just fall for it. 
[01:06:30]  The hope and change like O&A was just saying, that ain't nothing.  That was just a fucking ploy.  I know I use the F word a lot, but I do that when I'm pissed off.  That was just a ploy for everybody to fall for Obama's little game.  He won.  And we're going to lose in the long run.  Is it my turn?  Yes.  There is an observation here. 
[01:07:00]  I'm the observation king.  Glenn in New York sounds like he should be from Florida, and Eric in Florida sounds like he should be from New York.  Yes, exactly.  Good observation.  It's a good one, right, Ant?  It's perfect.  Go ahead, Eric in Florida.  That sounds more like a New Yorker than Glenn in New York.  Go ahead, Eric.  Well, let me tell you, Glenn.  I know a little something about medicine because I work in medicine.  I've been doing it for over 25 years.  And the backroom deal that was brokered by the, where was he from, Nebraska, I believe.  And then, what's her name, from Louisiana. 
[01:07:30]  You know, those two deals that got brokered, that was a crock of shit.  I totally agree with that statement.  You know, however.  Hey, at least we heard about those.  Yeah, the health care crisis that's going on in this country is mostly, mostly insurance as well as attorney.  Help me out, Ant.  The whole thing with lawsuits.  Malpractice, insurance, the drug companies.  There's a whole thing.  I've talked about it before.  I don't think we need this sweeping health care reform as far as insurance for everybody goes. 
[01:08:00]  Go to the insurance companies and start racking some head and making sure they stay in line.  Make them accountable to people instead of to shareholders.  Take the money component in terms of being a for-profit organization.  I mean, you can earn a decent living, but come on.  When you bastardize it, you just exploit it.  By the way, dude, I didn't want this to turn into a health care discussion.  I wanted this to just remain.  Obama said many, many times that this would be open to the public. 
[01:08:30]  We would be able to hear this, and we're not going to be able to.  All right, let's move on.  Thank you, Eric in Florida.  Thank you, Glenn in New York.  We're going to go to Bill in Virginia.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  I like what people could simplify these heavy debates that we have on the show.  And I think Bill's going to do that right now.  Go ahead, Bill.  Yeah, I put Obama with Popeye's chicken.  Where's my bucket of chicken?  I show up, and he promises a lot of stuff, and where's my chicken?  That's what I want to know, guys.  Where's my chicken? 
[01:09:00]  So now it's like the Popeye's when they were going to promise everybody the bucket.  It's like the free chicken giveaway, yeah.  And then they got there, and there wasn't no bucket.  And that's what.  Now how am I going to feed my kids?  So Obama basically isn't allowing people to get their bucket.  To get their bucket.  Did you get your bucket yesterday?  I didn't get my bucket.  Man, you know what?  I wanted to get my bucket yesterday, and I didn't either.  Yeah, I didn't get my bucket.  Fuck, I want some fucking Popeye's now.  God damn it.  What am I going to do?  So, Kevin in Connecticut, how are you, sir? 
[01:09:30]  Good morning, guys.  Happy New Year.  Hey, by the way, I still enjoyed your tweet last night.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, thank you.  I retweeted Kevin's little thing, and then it turns out it's a scene from a movie, but  I don't care, because it was still really, really funny in my eyes.  Funny's funny.  Funny's funny.  What do you got, Kevin?  I enjoyed it.  I got a worse channel than C-SPAN, any of the C-SPANs.  Really?  Really?  That internal word television, the EWTN, the all-Catholic programming.  Holy shit.  I think we got a worse channel than C-SPAN 3.  That's pretty bad. 
[01:10:00]  That's the one with the really old-looking nun, and it sounds like a cult.  Mother Angelica?  Yes.  Could someone get me some audio of that for real?  She's up there.  I can't even watch that as a goof.  They're like...  Yeah, you can't.  He's right.  You can't even watch that as a goof.  No.  No.  You can't even watch it as a goof.  No.  It makes the Catholic religion look like it's a cult.  That's crazy to think.  Hey, Ant.  Yeah.  No audio. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, no.  It's back.  Oh, boy.  What's up, Ant?  It's back.  What's up?  All right.  Then we got a bunch of Obama...  I love Obama.  I hate Obama calls.  Yeah, now it's just going to go like...  I think you make a good point, though.  I like when you...  You suck, Isaac.  See, this guy says Republicans refuse to cooperate.  That's why...  Well, you know something?  The Democrats refuse to cooperate with Republicans.  That's why it's got to be...  You know, just because one side won't cooperate doesn't mean you lock them out and lock the  public out of the discussions when the public is the one that's paying for the whole goddamn 
[01:11:00]  thing.  It's brutal that these two sides just don't want to work together.  I'm not being represented.  I'm not being represented in these discussions about health care.  And I'm going to be taxed on it.  So if you ask me, that's taxation without representation, my friend.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  You wait till...  I got...  One more thing, and then I'll get off my soapbox. 
[01:11:30]  Please register to vote and vote in the 2010 elections, please.  Could you please do that?  Are you officially working for Hannity?  No, I'm working for me.  Yeah.  Yep.  Vote.  Get out there and throw these sons of bitches out.  Balance the power back out again.  Just balance it.  I'm not talking about one side running the other.  Make it so nothing gets done anymore again, where it's all balanced and they just duke it 
[01:12:00]  out and no one has a majority.  I'm proud to say that people are acknowledging me as the Observation King now on Twitter.  Ah.  If Howard can make his own nickname, I can make mine.  What, you like Seinfeld observations or...  Ooh, yeah, you know what?  A little like that?  I can't compete with Seinfeld with my observations.  Mine are more like quirky observations.  Last night was one of those fucking...  I love that, hello, episode.  That was last night.  I was fucking... 
[01:12:30]  I was so happy when I turned on Seinfeld and it was, hello, la, la, la.  That is one of my favorite episodes.  I'm back in with Seinfeld.  Hello.  And then, hello.  And then they get tired of it.  It's fantastic.  I re-watched the episode with George, you know, pushing the fucking wheelchair lady because  of that dumb story I told with the fire in the movie theater.  So I re-watched a couple of those scenes.  Right, man.  Hello.  Hello. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, you got one?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  What's that?  Oh, it's just a stupid thing.  Well, I'm sure it's stupid.  It's not about me, is it?  No.  No, that's right.  Hello, me.  All right.  You know this girl, Claire, I'm seeing?  Yeah.  Well, he and I started joking that when she falls asleep, her stomach stays awake all night  and talks to me.  How's she talking?  Well, the belly button's like a mouth.  I'm bored.  Talk to me. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, I got to start taking these stupid mornings more seriously.  See you later.  Yeah, right on.  Hello.  Hello.  Very good.  We're just about ready for a break.  We got Patrice O'Neill joining the program next.  Bob Kelly a little later.  Oh, Patrice is coming.  Hello.  You know what?  We should probably do this before a break.  A lot of people are asking us about Artie Lang.  Yeah.  Wow.  There's a thing in the paper today. 
[01:14:00]  But it's page six, which is trash.  A trash.  It's trash.  It's a piece of shit.  Richard Johnson's a piece of shit.  So I don't even know if this is true.  Because trust me, I had to suffer because of his stupidity.  It's Richard Johnson.  I haven't forgot.  Trust me.  Having fun, are you?  Anyway, with that said, they're reporting this little article.  Stern sidekick in Suicide Tribe.  Troubled comic Artie Lang landed in the hospital after stabbing himself nine times in an apparent suicide attempt. 
[01:14:30]  Nine times.  But they don't get their facts right with this page six.  So I'm just reading what they're saying.  In an apparent suicide attempt, sources told the Post, Lang's frantic mom called 911 Saturday morning after she entered his Hoboken apartment and found the bloodied funny man.  A law enforcement source said, Lang sustained six hesitation wounds and three deep plunges. 
[01:15:00]  A source close to Lang's management team confirmed that the Howard Stern sidekick stabbed himself, adding that his mother had come to visit him that day to drop off food.  Surgeons managed to save Lang despite heavy bleeding.  We all have our demons, Stern said on air this week, referring to Lang's past battle with addiction.  Artie has given this show tremendous moments of great comedy.  He's a tremendous contributor.  He's a good man. 
[01:15:30]  Don't forget how great he is.  So that's what's being reported, man, in this piece of shit paper, the New York Post today.  That's somebody that's hurting.  Yeah, no shit.  Damn.  Because we have our suicide bit that Ant and I do.  That's deep.  But this is like the real deal.  This is a guy.  That's not one of those.  That sounds like he's in hell.  I took some aspirin and then 10 minutes later call a friend and go, I don't know how many I took.  Right, right, right.  You know, that is somebody that... 
[01:16:00]  I mean, the hesitation wounds.  That means I'm going to do this.  And then everything in your body stops you.  Because, yeah.  Just in time.  I think your survival instinct just pulls your arm back.  I mean, it's got to.  Right.  And then to be able to do that.  Oh, Jesus, man.  And you know what?  There's no jokes here.  We just wish nothing but the best for Artie Lang.  Simple as that.  I like Artie, man.  Simple as that.  I see him in the hallways and in the elevator and stuff.  And we have a little chit-chat every now and then. 
[01:16:30]  I like Artie.  I respect Artie.  I mean, me and him had a massive confrontation in the hallway here at SiriusXM.  It was ridiculous.  It could have got real ugly.  And then, like, both sides calmed down.  And then I searched him out and we talked.  And I explained my point on the whole thing.  And he listened to me.  And he respected what I had to say.  And after that day, nothing but pleasantries.  Nothing but, you know, how you doing?  Oh, man, getting up early sucks. 
[01:17:00]  And how do you guys do?  Because, ugh, this is rough.  Blah, blah, blah.  We always, it doesn't matter who gets in that elevator in the morning.  We always have the, doesn't it suck to get up this early talk?  Except, boy, Gary.  Two days ago, I'm in an elevator with him.  I'm like, all right, how about you just take your own fucking elevator?  I talk to Gary in the elevator.  Do you?  Well, he fucking hates me.  Whatever.  The feeling is mutual.  Trust me.  Just take your own fucking elevator.  What happened with you two?  Huh?  What happened with you two?  What happened?  He was the biggest spy going back in the day. 
[01:17:30]  Well, he was a soldier for his general.  Yeah, but in front of us, he's like, ah, da-da-da-da-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  And then runs to, you know, his boss.  And he was a fucking double agent.  He knows it.  He knows why I don't like him.  I just see the...  Well, then he jumps in the elevator.  We're ready to go upstairs.  He jumps in the elevator with us.  And then he's huffing and puffing.  I'm like, then take your own fucking elevator.  I don't need you to do my job.  So you don't see you two getting back together or...  We were never together.  I'm teasing, of course. 
[01:18:00]  I don't...  He knows what he is.  You don't think you'll ever be on a civil basis with him?  No.  Never.  No.  Artie Lang's stand-up guy.  Like I said, we had our issue and I explained it to him.  I'll explain to Gary why I fucking hate him.  He knows.  See, the thing is...  He caused a lot of the problems back in the day with Howard.  Because he would run to Howard every single time we were doing something.  But that's his job.  Well, then don't talk to us like we're friends.  Then don't talk to us like we're friends.  But that was his job.  That's that phony shit that I don't respect. 
[01:18:30]  Like, when you're battling somebody, you want to kind of get in their camp.  He was never in our camp.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't mean get in their camp.  I mean sneak in their camp, do a little recon, and come back and tell people what's going on.  Right.  So, like, that's how I see it.  I'm trying to think if we had anybody that would do the same thing.  Right.  Like, did we have anybody over at K-Rock when we were at NEW that would tell us what was going on over at Stern's camp? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  We did.  Yeah?  Name them.  I'm not naming anybody.  Name them.  We're way smarter.  Name them.  Name one guy.  Go ahead.  I'm not saying anything.  There's not one person alive that can name a guy, except for the guy.  Yeah.  That's why we're way smarter.  I took the elevator with Sal today, and we were nice to each other, one of Howard's guys.  Nice.  Hey, what's up?  Blah, blah, blah.  No big deal.  But Gary comes in huffing and puffing in the elevator.  Then take your own elevator.  There's eight elevators going up to this floor every two minutes. 
[01:19:30]  Take another one.  I just, see, I don't have any problem with him.  I just, I saw it for what it is.  You're in a battle with someone.  He was a good soldier.  Mm-hmm.  For Howard.  Whatever.  That's it.  Fred's cool.  Fred rules.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  Fred rules.  He really does.  You know that, this is...  Fred just looks like a happy guy, too.  He... 
[01:20:00]  You walk around, you just give him a nod, and he's just like, hey.  He looks like Eddie Vedder.  I ran into him in the hallway yesterday, and for a split second, I thought Eddie Vedder  was coming down the hall.  He does kind of look...  I'll tell you why Fred rules.  He doesn't get involved with any of this crap.  He seems like another one that's like...  He just smiles and waves, shows over, his coat's on.  Oh, yeah.  He just smiles and waves.  Get the fuck out.  I feel like when people from this staff run into people from that staff, it's kind of  like that old, the World War I Christmas truce, you know? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where it's like, we'll exchange cigarettes and chocolate and stuff, but then, you know,  once Christmas is over, you go back to your war.  I mean, that's just how it is.  You hear from beyond the trench, you know,  Oh, Christmas tree!  And then they start with their German version.  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  But, yeah, no, Fred rules.  And I didn't even bring this up on the air.  New Year's Eve, you know how you do a little dinner before you do a little of that drink 
[01:21:00]  and then look at Dick Clark fuck up the countdown thing?  So I go to this restaurant pretty close to my house with a few people, and I'm sitting,  and I don't even know if he knows, but Fred walks in with his little posse and sits  at the table right next to us.  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  There was no problems.  No.  See him in the gym, he boxes, I box.  Oh, yeah?  There was one time we were boxing side by side.  Duke it out?  I wouldn't. 
[01:21:30]  You know what?  I've seen him hit a bag.  Yeah?  He's pretty fucking, he's all right.  Got some juice.  He's got some juice behind that punch.  But anyway, this started with the Artie Lang thing.  Yeah.  You know, honestly, no jokes.  No, no.  Not going to go after the fucking guy.  Nothing.  I hope he...  We wish nothing but the best.  Artie knows a lot of the guys that does this radio show.  I hope he's able to, you know, get rid of them demons.  Right.  He's been having a problem with that for a long time. 
[01:22:00]  And if you haven't seen it, Artie Lang's last appearance on Jimmy Fallon had me fucking  Oh, fuck, dude.  Rolling.  I know.  I saw that one.  Fucking rolling.  If you're looking for something to do during the break, maybe do a quick YouTube.  Artie Lang on Jimmy Fallon.  I told him, too.  I think that was the last time I talked to him.  I said, Artie, holy shit, that Fallon appearance.  Wow.  Yeah, he did a good job on that one.  Really good.  Enough of this ass kissing.  Well, not ass kissing, but the guy's fucking...  I'm just fucking with you.  The guy's in a fucking spot, man.  I know.  It's terrible.  So, I mean... 
[01:22:30]  And I...  Eh, whatever.  I was going to get a fucking soapbox about...  All right, listen.  Norton was on Leno last night.  We're going to go to break with...  Who's he?  Norton's appearance.  No shit.  Jim Norton?  He's ready...  Never heard of him.  He's ready to jump on someone else's coattails at this point.  Oh, that coattail skipper.  I think he's a flea ready to hit another dog.  Ready to jump onto another dog.  Fucking our little Jimmy is just blowing up.  He had another great appearance on Leno last night. 
[01:23:00]  We'll go to break with this.  And when we come back, Patrice O'Neal.  Yes.  Joins the festivities.  All righty.  Jim Norton's a funny guy.  We've had him on our show many times.  Here he is with our own segment called Jim Norton, Uninvited Guest.  Yes!  Thank you.  Thank you, Jay.  Ladies and gentlemen, can everybody just leave Tiger Woods alone?  Am I the only one who actually likes him more now than I ever did? 
[01:23:30]  I finally relate to him.  I don't relate to a smiling guy with a nine iron.  I relate to a naked man in the fetal position, repeating over and over, couldn't that hooker  have just kept her mouth shut?  I understand his wife divorcing him.  All right, fine.  He's a lousy husband.  He's selfish.  But she was probably only with him because of who he is.  Let's be honest.  It wasn't his looks. 
[01:24:00]  I mean, come on.  He looks like a tan smurf.  He's creepy looking.  And have you ever seen anybody panic the way Tiger Woods did?  He panicked.  He hit a tree and a fire hydrant.  The two most stationary objects on the face of the earth.  Too bad there wasn't a glacier for him to have a head-on collision with.  But that shows you what panic is. 
[01:24:30]  This man has the hand-eye coordination to hit a ball into a hole at 300 yards, but his  wife yells at him and he's like, ah, oak tree.  And at least he went out with hot girls.  At least he did that.  He screwed up with pretty girls.  I think men can appreciate that.  Steve Phillips from ESPN, that idiot ruined a broadcasting career with a girl who looks  like Meatloaf in 1978. 
[01:25:00]  That was kind of mean.  I apologize to Meatloaf.  And men should not be self-righteous about Tiger Woods.  Women, I kind of get why you hate him.  I really do.  Because I think women understand that on some level, no matter how much your husband loves  you, he is as weak as Tiger Woods.  And I think women know that.  Like, no matter how great your husband is, he's the world's greatest dad, they'd walk  through fire for you. 
[01:25:30]  If any one of Tiger's mistresses walked up to him and said, would you like some oral sex?  He'd say, you bet I would.  So I think that's the problem.  And one of the girls said that Tiger wasn't even wearing condoms, which really made me  feel a special kinship with Tiger Woods.  Because I hate wearing condoms, but I'm not exactly in the same position he's in.  He has a billion dollars to lose.  I have nothing to lose and herpes to give.  But his critical error, the critical error, that answering machine message, Tiger, what 
[01:26:00]  are you doing in the cheater's handbook, page one?  Don't leave a message, stupid.  Send a text or an email, something that gives you plausible deniability.  And if you're going to leave a message, keep it kind of vague and ambiguous.  You know, go, hey, it's me.  Can you do that thing?  See, he gave the whole farm away.  Hey, look, it's me, Tiger Woods, the black Asian golfer. 
[01:26:30]  My wife went through my phone, and she suspects we've been having an affair, which, of course,  we have been.  Malibu was great.  Do me a favor, change your outgoing message, and listen, just do it quickly and be discreet.  Again, Tiger Woods, black Asian golfer, sponsored by Cadillac, Nike, and Gillette.  All right, I'll just...  Or should I say, formally sponsored? 
[01:27:00]  Why are sponsors walking away?  I don't understand why sponsors abandoned a guy for having sex.  I can understand why Cadillac might not want to endorse him.  He didn't exactly make the Escalade look like a sturdy vehicle.  That was not a good commercial for the Escalade.  What was he doing, two miles an hour, and he goes over an anthill, and then he's almost  dead in the middle of the street? 
[01:27:30]  What is the grill of the Escalade made out of?  Wax paper?  He's like, bonk, and it's just kind of wrapped around the tree.  AT&T has pulled their endorsement.  They dropped Tiger, and that really annoyed me.  Why is AT&T concerned with the sexual private life of Tiger Woods?  Why doesn't AT&T spend their energy trying to improve the lousy service on the iPhone?  I have...  Look, some of you have an iPhone.  It gets great reception if you're on the roof of the AT&T building. 
[01:28:00]  And the person you're talking to is in the top floor of that building, and if they're  looking out, and you're looking down at them, if you have eye contact, it's an excellent  service.  I think AT&T is just a little jealous that Tiger's been in more hotspots than their 3G  network.  AT&T should not abandon Tiger Woods.  They should attach a cell tower to a zipper. 
[01:28:30]  Nike is the one sponsor who said, they are not going anywhere, they're going to stand  by Tiger, and they should.  Because who better personifies, just do it, than Tiger Woods?  Thank you, buddy.  Good job.  All right, we'll get into it.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  True. 
[01:29:00]  Just giving...  How are you here, man?  I don't know where to start with Patrice.  He just gave us a lot of stuff in that last five minutes.  How are you guys doing, man?  What do you decide on that, Mike?  Sorry.  How are you guys doing, man?  We're all right.  Happy holidays, or happy whatever you're supposed to say.  Yeah, whatever it is, it's over now.  We had an attitude adjustment.  We needed to get out of here for two weeks, and now we're happy again.  We're happy.  I needed a month.  I've still got a month.  I ain't working until next week.  A month and two weeks, man.  You needed to just, like, kind of get off the grid?  Oh, Jesus.  I was babysitting, dog sitting. 
[01:29:30]  Just being square.  Babysitting?  Rethinking.  Happy that I'm actually a comic.  Were you assessing?  Um, no.  Doing self-assessment?  Well, yeah, because I'm disappointed in show business.  It's just anything that, you know, you get into the business and you go, I'm a funny guy.  I like funny.  Yeah.  Boy, show business is here.  A guy, a piece of shit like me who can make a buck making people laugh because I'm a funny dude. 
[01:30:00]  But I get into it, and in the 18th year, I just realized one thing you don't need in this business is integrity.  You're a fucking idiot.  If you have some type of core value system, it's useless.  You know something?  It just makes you stupid to fucking do that.  There's no karma.  There's no justice.  The devil runs show business.  And I got in it. 
[01:30:30]  You know what it's like?  It's like Serpico.  It's like if you grow up as a kid, this business, if you grow up as a kid, and your thing is, I'm going to make sure that no one gets bullied.  I'm going to make sure no one gets fucked over.  I'm going to make sure jocks don't push around other kids.  And I'm going to be a natural cop.  Then you grow up and you go, you know what?  Transition will be that.  Then you go find out that actually saving kittens out of a tree, all your other cop friends will say you're a fucking idiot.  If you go and do things that you think cops are supposed to fucking do. 
[01:31:00]  Same thing with this business.  You just go, hey, man, you're funny.  You fucking do things.  You laugh.  Make people laugh.  And it's all good, right?  Fucks no, nigga.  It drives you crazy.  When Bobby comes in here, we talk.  At the end of the day, me and Bobby, me and Bobby, he is probably my closest comedic friend.  You know, there's two different kinds.  There's your friends and then there's your comedic friends. 
[01:31:30]  Bobby is close to being like in the real friend category.  And we talk, but now we have these talks where I'm like, yeah, that is fucking business.  And Bob has transitioned into, you know, I don't do the dude thing, but Bobby has transitioned into everything is wonderful.  Look at the bright side guy.  And I'm like, go fuck yourself.  Like, look at the positive side, dude.  And when did that happen?  It happens when you are trying to be you in this business and they rape you. 
[01:32:00]  Look, I'm looking at Gilbert Arenas and it hit me yesterday.  The only unforgivable crime in this country is if you make white people upset.  Gilbert Arenas, the gun didn't bother people.  It's not the gun.  It's his non-contrite attitude.  That was true.  And they must make niggas pay for your non-contriteness. 
[01:32:30]  That happens to white guys, too, though.  It really does.  When I say niggas, I mean everybody.  Like, make a nigga pay.  Yeah, if you're not contrite, no matter what color you are, yes.  They don't appreciate that.  I meant niggas.  I should have said men.  That goes across the board.  Absolutely.  Let me give you an example of something.  Arenas, yeah, the gun thing, whatever.  It was happening.  They were looking into it, whatever.  But he got suspended and fined for not being contrite.  You're absolutely right.  Now, if you remember... 
[01:33:00]  In reality.  Yeah.  Not the legitimate reason, but in reality, that's why.  Sure.  But if you remember, we got suspended not for...  It was not for the fact that a homeless guy came in and started talking about Condoleezza  Rice and having sex with the queen and the first lady.  It wasn't that.  Right.  If you remember, we slide on that.  It was...  We weren't contrite about it, and we had goofed on it a little bit the next day or the next  two days, and that's what suspended us. 
[01:33:30]  So, it's the same fucking thing.  Yeah.  Same fucking thing.  Well, I should have said nigga...  When I said nigga, I didn't mean black people.  You're right.  I'm Sicilian.  I meant...  I just meant right now.  We understand that.  It's just a bad situation.  But Patrice, what got Gilbert was the picture which made me laugh so fucking hard when he's  on the sideline with the two fingers like it's guns, and his teammates are around him,  and they're all laughing their asses off.  That got him in trouble right there.  I thought that was the greatest thing I've seen in a long time.  I was laughing my ass off. 
[01:34:00]  Well...  That was sort of making fun of the situation, and he's got some shit to deal with, and he's still  freaking, you know, mocking it.  Two, you know how you get sayings in your life that mean something to you for how long  it does?  One is, there's three sides of every story.  It just hit me.  I never heard it before.  It just hit me.  There's three sides of every story.  Yours, mine, and the truth.  I thought I was genius, but somebody was like, you never heard that?  And I was like, no.  No, that's a good one.  But my tendency is to believe Gilbert because...  But the way these sportscasters... 
[01:34:30]  And this is going back to show business.  It's just like these guys, you can see the transformation where he was this witty, wonderful  guy that we liked.  And then how dare you make light of this?  He said, look, I brought the gun.  Me and the guy was gambling.  I brought the guns to say, you better give me my money, motherfucker.  But I was joking.  It's a joke, right.  And my guns were unloaded.  I just showed him that because it's cool to see guns.  When I seen your guns, it's cool to see guns.  It's cool to see guns.  It's just cool to see guns.  Absolutely.  When you don't own a bunch of guns. 
[01:35:00]  And you have movie guns, which is beautiful, man.  Video game guns.  Video game guns.  I hope you guys just got video game guns.  It's a beautiful thing.  I just bought an Uzi.  Is that legal?  Yeah.  Is that legal?  It's fantastic.  It's legal.  Nine millimeter Uzi.  I don't think a Uzi's legal.  Yeah, because I got a 16-inch barrel on it.  I can't have a short barrel.  That's amazing.  I can't have a short barrel.  That's just amazing.  You're not going to trip Ann up.  No, I didn't try to trip him up.  I'm like, I thought Uzi's were...  It's fucking great. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, that's fucking great.  It's fun.  Can you kill a motherfucker with that?  He becomes a gun.  Holy shit.  If I want to pick and choose.  I'm saying without...  Oh, yeah.  That wouldn't be a problem.  It's a legal weapon.  And if they come in your home, you can still defend yourself to the death?  Based on if it merits deadly physical force as per the laws, you could use whatever gun you want.  Well, as I'm sitting home for the month and a half, next week I work again in Tampa.  And I just came to the realization that I wasted 18 years. 
[01:36:00]  I just wasted 18 years of having some type of issues with how I conduct myself.  You know what I mean?  Really?  I try to conduct myself with respect, and it's dumb.  You don't see it as a growing process.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  It's fucking dumb.  You're maturing.  You went from, like, the guy you were...  Because I look back at the guy I was, let's say, you know, that many years ago, whatever. 
[01:36:30]  It ain't the same guy I am now.  I mean, you know, I laugh at the same shit.  I'm the same guy.  But there are certain aspects of my life that I had to, like, just kind of, you know...  And maturing sometimes is getting immature.  That's...  Like, you could mature by getting more immature.  You know what I mean?  It's not a...  I don't think you wasted your time.  That's for sure.  I just feel like I did.  I feel like... 
[01:37:00]  Oh, fucking no.  I feel like, you know, a lot of people in this business are acute...  There's a lot of prosperous people who...  No one respects, no one likes as a human being.  No one...  Everybody thinks it's a douche.  But they just are prosperous.  Yeah, yeah.  And their families are prosperous.  But maybe they're fucking miserable.  And they're just pieces of dog shit.  Maybe they're miserable.  Couldn't be more miserable than me.  All right.  No, I understand that.  I'm just saying... 
[01:37:30]  The grass is always greener kind of shit.  I hate the fact that I have to look at somebody...  You know, comic buddy right now is...  This dude, he's diabetic too.  And he's about the same age.  He's going blind and I have cancer and all kind of shit.  So I have to look at him at the age he is close to mine and his situation and go,  Well, I could be there but for the grace of God...  I have to look at his horror to feel better about my... 
[01:38:00]  I just basically, for real, I don't need a lot of money.  I basically am getting sick of...  This sounds like a fucking crazy rant.  I'm getting sick of bitches having opinions.  And that's all I get to see is fat black bitches, old white bitches, dykes.  All over your TV.  I fucking love it.  I'm watching Tyler Perry. 
[01:38:30]  His biggest character is Madea.  Yeah, Madea.  And I'm like, well, you know what?  To be a fucking man, you have to dress as a bitch and act sassy...  Right.  ...to get your...  To be able to be a sassy motherfucker.  Sassy, fucking, you know, I'm going to show you kind of thing.  He's got to dress like a bitch.  I just want to do...  All this comes to...  You're never going to dress like a bitch.  I've dressed like a bitch before.  I've looked...  When did you dress like a bitch?  In a movie called...  In the Cut. 
[01:39:00]  They had me dressed as a transsexual pimp doorman.  I think I saw that, yeah.  Was this a clip online?  It probably is.  Was this a clip online?  I saw that.  I don't remember this one.  And it was done...  It was the lady that did the piano.  So, what's her name that did the piano?  The director.  Oh, shit.  Anyway, she's one of those directors.  She's like the...  She was like the Daniel Day-Lewis of directors.  She would direct something every 16 years and they'd get an Oscar.  So I went in and read for this part.  I go, fuck it, my career. 
[01:39:30]  Bye, ho.  I'm playing a faggot.  This is it.  Retards or a fucking trans...  A transsexual doorman, nigga.  I'm in.  With Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo.  You're in.  Where do I sign up, right?  Right.  So I'm just sitting there and I look at that and go,  I'm just a big faggot for no reason.  Because I tried to do the tap dance to get something that I really don't know what I want.  But now I know what I want.  And I really don't need a lot of money from what I want.  I really just want to sit down and have an opinion about anything. 
[01:40:00]  That's why this is an enjoyable place to come.  You just fucking can say what the fuck you want.  Hope for the best.  But the game is very...  For a month and a half, I didn't miss comedy.  All right.  Let me go to Lady Trucker.  Lady Trucker is going to summarize what you're saying here.  Patrice, I'd like to welcome you to Midlife Crisis.  Is it a Midlife Crisis thing, Patrice?  I don't know what...  The only context I have for Midlife Crisis is like a white dude who buys... 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Who buys Uzi's?  Who buys small cars.  Sports cars and Uzi's?  I'm not sure I'm having a Midlife Crisis.  I'm really not positively sure of that.  I can't say I'm not because I don't know the rules of a Midlife Crisis.  But again, I'm 40.  To white guys, that's fucking teenage years.  Y'all start having families at 56.  Right.  For a black guy that might be at Midlife Crisis.  Getting up there at 40.  You know, if I feel a tingling in my pinky, I'm like, oh, Lord. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, Lord.  And I go, am I going to just die in here?  Like, okay, I went to eat.  This is what I did over the whole thing.  You know, I was into being a vegan for a minute.  I started eating fish.  And here and there, I just needed it.  I was starting to suffer.  Because some of the stuff you have to substitute for meat is worse than meat.  You know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just annoying.  But meat is a terrible thing.  It's just, then you start reading about what they put in food.  It's all fucked up.  So, anyway.  I went to a raw thing. 
[01:41:30]  Restaurant?  A restaurant where they just, everything's raw.  Right.  And I had, I said, yeah, I'm going to open my mind to this.  Sat down, I had raw lasagna.  What?  Exactly.  How do you have that?  I think I have that.  What is raw?  Dude.  How do they make raw lasagna?  I understand.  It was out of.  Other dishes, but.  Damn.  You have to cook lasagna.  It's, you don't.  What are the noodles crunchy?  Well, I had a delicious meal of spaghetti. 
[01:42:00]  Raw spaghetti.  Made out of, guess what they use spaghetti as?  Squash.  I know, squash.  That day, shaking this spaghetti.  Hold on.  Now you got to, now you got to shut up for a minute.  Me and Ann had a squash dinner once from our, from our exes.  Our exes got together and we said, we're going to have, make you dinner.  You guys are going to come home from work.  Make sure you come to the house because we got, we got a surprise for you guys.  So, me and Hope, we run out of work.  We're thinking about the best piece of steak or something nice. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, I'm thinking of steak or, yeah, something really cool.  Nice puffs.  Broganese, something, something hearty.  It's fucking winter in Boston.  We, we get over the house and both of the girls had just made squash spaghetti.  And they're like, here you go.  And we're like, what is it?  We're not saying, we're not, the big, we're not saying, try it, just eat it.  I ate this and I was like, this.  We didn't even eat it, Ann.  No, I took like a bite.  We tried it.  It was disgusting.  And said, this sucks a dick.  I could say to this day, worst meal ever. 
[01:43:00]  Horrid.  And then they're all pissed off because we're not enjoying this stupid squash fucking dinner.  Squash spaghetti dinner.  I think we went out to the bar right after that.  And got pizza.  Fuck you.  Pizza and a beer.  And they were motherfucking us.  Like, well, then don't make us fucking squash spaghetti.  Throwing away the squash spaghetti.  I had a positive attitude.  I think the dog didn't even eat it, Ann.  No.  We used to kick under the table.  My buddy I went with, he's really a health nut now and he's just into working out, which  is fine.  And I was open to it.  And I just. 
[01:43:30]  Did you try?  What did you think?  I go, I go, you know what?  I'm not.  I said, I'm not going to even fool myself to him.  He goes, man, let's do this for five days.  I said, no.  I go, I go.  This is unless they can fucking guarantee me in immortality.  If I live forever, I'll eat raw food.  If you can guarantee me, I'll never die like Dracula.  But if I die, if you say I'm going to die at 70, you know what?  Fuck you.  I'm not going to fucking suffer through this.  Because the raw lasagna, here's how you eat raw food.  You go, you always compare it to real food. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Usually you're like excited.  Your brain's like, fuck, this is lasagna.  They make it out of zucchini, bananas, like the plantains.  They have macadamia and cheese.  And this is how they make the cheese.  Jesus Christ.  This sounds fucking horrible.  Macadamia.  Don't make it look like cheese.  Raw food cheese.  And look, man, some people eat raw food.  And look, raw food keep you alive. 
[01:44:30]  That shit, that really does help you live.  You do feel better when you eat some of that raw shit.  You really do.  You do, you do.  But you make the cheese.  They put it in a blender with some shit.  And they make it into a paste.  It didn't taste like cheese, did it?  And then they put it into a dehydrator.  And it takes two days or a day for all of the...  It's like, I have to plan my shitty raw meal two days from now.  Like, two days, I got to start going, oh shit, 
[01:45:00]  I better make my goddamn macadamia nut cheese.  Because I'm going to really want that in two days.  And every bite is like, whoa, this is raw.  This tastes just like some shit I really want to eat.  But this is not what I want to eat.  Like, it just...  So my point is, you know, for a month and a half,  you're sitting around determining what you really are.  That's what I do every year.  And I determine...  You reflect at the end of every year.  That's why I said I think everyone goes through that 
[01:45:30]  around Christmas and New Year's.  And then that's why I'm glad when January 1st is here.  It's like, all right, enough of that fucking reflecting shit.  Another thing that scared me was three things that happened to me.  I realize I'm unfriendly.  One thing, I'm not going to fucking eat raw food.  And 2009 scared me.  I was scared for the first time ever is that the year went by too fast.  And I lived it.  Meaning, I'm here today.  I'm thinking of September right now. 
[01:46:00]  And September will be here.  Meaning, usually, at the end of the year, you go, whoa!  I remember every story, every second.  I remember when it happened.  I saw that was in February.  Meaning, I lived day by day.  The 365 days of 2009.  And it went by fast.  Do you understand what I'm fucking saying?  Meaning, my life is moving around.  I don't need any more info. 
[01:46:30]  You got that midlife crisis book.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Fucking, I remember January 1st in Vinny's shitty room on New Year's Eve, man.  Here's what happens.  Here's what happens.  You gotta get a woozy.  When you're young, you're waiting for things.  When you're a young guy, you're waiting for things.  You're constantly looking forward, especially when you're a kid.  You're looking forward to Christmas.  You're looking forward to your birthday.  You're looking forward to summer vacation. 
[01:47:00]  When you look forward to things, it takes forever.  It can't move fast enough, right?  It takes forever.  Now, when you get older, you're putting shit off.  You got bills.  You got bitches.  You got all fucking, all kinds of shit that you don't want to happen.  So it fucking creeps up on you so quickly that time seems to fucking shoot right by.  And then before you know it, that was three years ago?  What?  What?  Huh?  Yeah, you're right.  It is.  Supposedly you get, uh...  That's why we gotta play.  Kick the can. 
[01:47:30]  Kick the can.  There you go.  Supposedly, though, you get over this whole midlife crisis bug, and then you just move  on with your life.  I just don't want to die before I really put a foot in somebody's ass.  That means something.  Yeah, you want to kind of make a mark?  What do you want, a legacy or something?  I don't think of those things.  I don't even think of wills.  I didn't think of none of that shit.  Yeah.  There's a shit about the will thing. 
[01:48:00]  Well, you know.  They'll figure it out after we're gone.  I want to leave my fucking...  I want to leave my Jersey City condo to my girl.  Yeah, the government will take the whole fucking thing.  I like to leave my mother's shitty, dying poinsettia bush.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, your mom got you a poinsettia.  It's just dying.  Worst plant ever.  I fucking water it every day, and they just, the leaves, I was so depressed.  This is just dead leaves all on my table.  I won't move, and it just...  Wow. 
[01:48:30]  Dude, if you saw it into the year, it really nails you up the ass, doesn't it?  If you saw the poinsettia growing in your backyard, you would just chop it down thinking  it's a weed.  It's the worst.  Why the fuck are we buying these things?  My mother wanted me to have a Christmas spirit so bad when she came to visit us.  I said, Mom, just stop forcing...  Like, my mother just now got happy because she's in her 60s, so she's trying to change.  But she's miserable, too.  Like, it's in my blood.  I'm just surrounded by misery.  My girl's miserable.  We had a long talk about how miserable she is.  Really?  And how... 
[01:49:00]  Because we was in the store.  She had to buy the weed for her daughter for Christmas, of course, so we're in the store.  And it's just...  I will say, I have to say this.  Just white people are just nicer.  You're not better people, but just on the bullshit, just regular bullshit, you're nicer.  Just nice people.  And the two white people are trying to help her with this weed thing, and she's like,  what's nunchucks?  She just says it out loud in the store.  What's these nunchucks?  And this guy who doesn't work there... 
[01:49:30]  I can picture her doing that.  Just with a...  What's these nunchucks?  Yeah, what's weed nunchucks?  And just standing there, some guy that didn't even work there is like, oh, this is this.  And why is one black and the other one not black?  And she just was helping as if he worked here.  And she just went...  Then she gets up to the counter and the white girl goes, I hear you're buying the weed.  You know that the Mario's great for the weed.  And my girl just looks at it and just...  So we're in a car, and we're just... 
[01:50:00]  I'm looking out the window, and I'm just reflecting on us.  And she goes, you know what?  You just...  I don't think you like me.  I go, so what?  I want an answer.  But she goes, you know, I think you really don't like me.  And I just go, I don't...  You're not likable.  And she goes, sometimes I feel so lonely.  I go, because you're miserable, you're not a friendly person. 
[01:50:30]  We didn't meet under friendly conditions.  Me and my girl didn't meet, like, at the fucking bar.  Like, hi, I just...  Yeah, having a good time.  I met her at a voiceover, at a Spike Lee, at the 25th Hour, at a voiceover.  And I thought she was a cunt when I met her.  I said, just cunt.  I hate this bitch.  And when we met, we didn't have no fucking courtship.  But then we just ended up together.  And a lot of times right now, because we've been together so long, we have square people  conversations that I have to close my eyes and look back and go, wait a minute, we didn't 
[01:51:00]  have no fucking love affair, bitch.  Like, I hated you.  And there's parts of you I still hate.  But I got to know...  I'm the same way.  I'm one of those people like, once you get to know Patrice, I'm not a fucking good guy  right away.  I'm a great guy after...  After a while, yeah, yeah.  After years.  After...  I'll say years.  I think I could talk.  Patrice has the age where it's fucking wine or Jack Daniels in a cast or some shit. 
[01:51:30]  Over the years...  How long have you been doing the show, for real?  10 years?  Before y'all...  A little bit before you left N.E.W.  N.E.W.  So, 2000...  You probably started in 2001.  Early 2001, I would guess.  So...  Maybe.  We've known you a long time.  I would say Patrice, the most intimidating guy we've ever had on the show, as a regular.  Easily.  Who do you put up there?  Intimidating?  No.  When you first meet Patrice?  Holy shit, yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Name someone else that's more intimidating than Patrice over the years.  When we first met him?  It took a while to warm up.  What?  I didn't know that.  Hell fucking yeah.  Wow.  No, no.  Now we sort of know how we all like all our inner workings, but at first, yeah, there  was a little like, holy shit, this guy's intense.  Funny as hell, but intense.  I didn't feel that.  Intimidating.  No, I thought it was...  Who would you put up there?  Because he was a comic, I didn't feel that way, you know?  You were saying funny shit, it was like, you know, it's funny, it's not like... 
[01:52:30]  If he was a boxer or some shit and came in, I'd be like...  Alright, who do you put ahead of Patrice?  As a regular?  Comedian-wise, yeah.  That someone that, when they first started doing the show, was intimidating.  I think, like, DiPaolo is even more intimidating.  DiPaolo's up there.  DiPaolo's up there.  And he's one of those guys.  DiPaolo's up there.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  To let people go, is he really like that?  I go, yeah.  Yes, yes.  You know what, Anthony Mayer nailed it.  Because Nick is...  Nick is intense, too. 
[01:53:00]  Nick is salty.  Oh.  Because he...  Salty.  Nick.  He's a victimized...  Yeah.  ...white guy.  Yep.  He fucking thinks the world is out to get him.  Oh, yeah.  Alright.  So he has no friends.  And he's very...  You nailed it, Ant.  He's a nasty man.  But I love him.  I do love him.  And I think he's fucking hysterical, but...  Nick is a mess!  But he's nasty.  He will rip your head off.  No problem.  No problem. 
[01:53:30]  And that's when you're getting along with him.  Yeah.  Alright, you know what, Ant?  I asked you and you came...  Yeah, I think that's the one.  You came through.  Well, we got Bob Kelly outside.  What?  Bobo!  Nice.  We should take a break.  Like Bobby.  Taking shorter breaks today, which is nice.  But anyway, to sum it all up and say, hey, guys, I appreciate you coming on here.  Because I think getting just to scream all that stuff out there.  Patrice, let me...  Maybe, you know, because I can relate to you, believe it or not. 
[01:54:00]  A lot of people probably go, no.  But believe it or not.  There's times where you're just fucking like...  This show is pretty much all I do.  And then I leave.  And aside from occasionally going to the range and popping off some rounds, most of my time  is spent sitting on my couch, watching television in a giant empty house.  So I have time to reflect and look around and go, what the fuck am I really doing?  It's like I'm existing for the show, but then all the other time is waiting. 
[01:54:30]  Like I'm waiting for something that nothing's going to happen.  Like I wait for the weekend.  And I go, oh, the weekend's here.  And then I go, why did I wait for the weekend?  And there's people out there that just think that this conversation is sickening because  we're in quarantine.  We got good spots.  But my thing is like if I ever argue with a plumber about whatever, I go, I didn't...  Listen, I compare my misery to my fucking self. 
[01:55:00]  I made the decisions that I made.  Right.  You decided to fucking be a plumber.  That's what plumbers do.  I don't compare my choices to your...  Because I'm not a square.  This is why I respect what we do more than doctors or anything else is because you can be  a doctor if you decide to be.  True, yeah.  Like there's just no leap of faith as a doctor.  You just go, I'm going to school.  That's why everybody's mother goes, yay. 
[01:55:30]  You're going to be a doctor.  That's why my mother was like, hmm.  His mom at 22, her boy, she saw a boy become a man who still lived at the house.  And my decision, my drum roll was comedian.  And she went, hmm.  That is the truth.  You know what it is?  There's no finish line.  Like, like it's...  I'm still falling.  A lot of parents want the guarantee.  Like you said, a doctor.  Your kids have a guarantee.  There's a line.  There's a line when all of a sudden they hand you paper after years of school and money 
[01:56:00]  and shit, and you step over that line and I'm a doctor.  We're in this gray area of like...  It could have tomorrow.  What the fuck is it?  And we made the choice.  Right.  See, that's the thing is people are like, they're complaining about, motherfucker, this  shit ain't...  Complaining?  Sometimes my mother, she goes, I go, I think I'm...  I might get this deal and shit and she goes, here's time for you to buckle down and...  I go, are you giving me some fucking advice on my shit that I've done alone? 
[01:56:30]  You don't have a passport, ma!  She's just...  I'm not worldly.  Like, when I sit here and I listen to her be a mother.  A motherly advice.  Which is why women have kids just to have somebody that's forced to listen to them.  Yeah.  But we have arguments now because I don't have to listen to my mother.  I go, ma, what the fuck are you talking about?  Legitimately.  Like, not ma, what's going...  Like, ma, here, sit, have a seat.  I can just feel you drifting away. 
[01:57:00]  Just sit down, your feet are swelling up.  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Yeah.  Because this business is so lonely because no one believes in you.  When you go, I'm going to be a comic, everyone goes, you're...  It's like, you ever try to tell somebody an actual dream?  Man, I fell asleep last night, man.  It was a unicorn with a gun.  And he had on boots.  That's what you should say when you say you would go to show business.  Alone.  To you, it was like fucking...  Yeah.  I used to fucking go outside.  Right? 
[01:57:30]  When you first start out, you can only get a gig every two months.  Every two months.  And I used to go outside and just go someplace pretending I was going to do comedy.  So she didn't think that this was a fiasco.  Oh, shit.  I'm telling you.  So now it's like you're at this point.  It's a lonely game.  That's what people...  Look, you know Gavin.  You know Big Gavin and shit.  We love Gavin.  Man, he gets so hurt at how bad of friends we are.  We're not real friends.  Like, me and Bobby might talk every six months. 
[01:58:00]  Bobby's in the back there.  There's Bob Price.  Fucking Brando.  We used to pass Gavin off on each other like...  I used to go...  Wait a minute.  That's my nigga.  But Gavin couldn't understand that we're not real friends.  We're lonely, lonely people.  And he didn't understand that me and Bobby would talk every month. 
[01:58:30]  The last time me and Bobby talked, Bobby gets on the phone and goes,  Oh, dude.  You know what?  It's been three weeks.  I haven't thought about you in three weeks, man.  So what's going on?  Like, he started out by saying...  You know what's weird?  I didn't even think of you in three weeks.  That's my line.  And I go...  I go, okay, Bobby.  We picked up from a conversation we had three weeks ago.  And then we...  And we're not going to talk again for another month and some change. 
[01:59:00]  That's the lifestyle.  It's just...  But you can have friends like that.  Yeah, there's a lot of people that can relate to that.  I don't like...  Like, I couldn't imagine a daily friend like fucking Jughead and Archie kind of everyday friend.  Just telling her I'm...  You'd rather be alone in your house reflecting.  What? You know something?  There are a lot of times...  All of us.  I might be miserable.  All of us.  But I'd rather be alone.  Like, I'm just sitting there going, what am I doing?  I'm flipping through the channels.  I drink a little wine.  I'm sitting there going like, eh, there's no one here. 
[01:59:30]  And then I think of someone being there and I go, ugh.  Like, I don't want to talk to anybody.  It's so...  I don't want to fucking talk.  It's easier to be alone.  I'm alone.  It really is.  But I don't want to talk to anybody.  That's what my woman doesn't understand.  She thinks I hate her.  I just...  You don't understand, sweetie.  My loneliness.  It's so important to me.  You're...  And don't try to help me not be lonely.  Yeah.  Like, I don't like anybody right now.  I don't want to talk to anybody.  I don't want to see anybody.  Yeah.  I just want to be introverted Grinch. 
[02:00:00]  If somebody saw my holidays from Thanksgiving to now...  Yeah.  It would be a sad scene in a movie that somebody would think they wrote.  Just...  Just...  If you did a time lapse of me just sitting around jerking off three times a day.  Three times a day.  That's your holiday.  I have mastered left-hand mouse...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  ...jerking off to the right. 
[02:00:30]  And I'm sitting there looking for the exact right porn.  And you never get it.  We were talking about it yesterday.  Yesterday, how it's like...  You never find the exact...  How you go...  How you go...  This is the one.  I'm going to finish to this one.  And then you're just about ready and go...  Now there's a better one.  There's a better one.  And hours go by.  Hours.  And then you end up coming as you're rewinding.  You're coming.  You go like...  Why am I like so much fun?  Did you ever come...  I'm not coming to this one.  Did you ever come and not feel anything?  You waited too long?  The feeling slowly leaked out over a half hour? 
[02:01:00]  And then you're just mad that you spent so much time doing that.  Finding that perfect moment.  We never find a perfect moment.  It's just...  It's just...  But, Patricia...  I wouldn't trade it in.  No.  Patricia, you do realize a lot of the stuff you're saying, most guys out there can relate  to.  And men, I'm sure some of the women as well.  We are creeps.  Holidays suck.  They really do suck.  The older you get.  People don't want to...  People don't...  I think death is starting to bother me. 
[02:01:30]  It's a midlife crisis.  Yeah, I just...  You feel every fucking pain in your body now.  You know what?  In my lifetime, I've never...  Only can imagine Elvis as being the comparative.  No one has cared about a death of anybody more than Michael Jackson in my life.  In my lifetime.  That was a biggie.  JFK, Elvis, Michael Jackson, huge.  Yeah, yeah.  John Lennon.  Nobody gives a fuck.  Lennon was a biggie.  Lennon, but nobody cares. 
[02:02:00]  Nobody fucking gives a shit.  So you're just here and you're gone.  But once you accept that...  You're done.  Once you accept that, then you're done.  Then you're done with it.  But then it's just like, all right.  And I'm more important than most people.  People know my name.  But there's a guy right now that's just...  Nobody gives a fuck.  At least you'll be on the internet for a little bit.  The internet's kind of giving everybody a little immortality for as long as that lasts. 
[02:02:30]  And I want fucking to be burned.  You do?  I do not.  Alive?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You fucking cremated.  Yeah.  Because I don't want to be anybody's oil.  What?  In a year, 40 billion.  Wow.  You don't want to pump into somebody's...  I don't want to just be oil.  It's like, this is what my life came down to.  Fucking brontosaurus.  Some brontosaurus is my fucking oil.  No.  Burn me, motherfucker. 
[02:03:00]  How's this?  I'm not into somebody's fucking flying car, nigga.  Fuck you.  How's this?  After you die, there will be thousands and thousands of beautiful days.  Just beautiful days for other people to enjoy.  Shut up.  That's horrible.  Look, look.  It's a beautiful sun coming up here in New York City today, and there are millions and  millions of people that are not going to see it today.  Oh, fuck.  That's creepy.  Why don't we take a break?  Well, that was my holiday.  I appreciate it.  If we're going to continue with this, we better get some pot. 
[02:03:30]  We'll talk about something.  We're going to have fun after the break.  Because I just creeped myself out.  We'll talk about this commerce officer that used to have a big dick.  Yeah, all right.  We'll get it.  We're going to dumb it down.  Back to business, nigga.  We're going to dumb it down after the break.  Now, questions later. 
[02:04:00]  Wrong.  I don't know what that means.  I hope he knows you wouldn't let me ask you what your question means.  No, no, no, no.  Fucking it's going to go.  Not good.  My man was just showing me his goods. 
[02:04:30]  Goods.  His goods.  It actually made it on a website already.  It did?  Yeah.  People like to post things like that.  But why don't you get like a six shooter?  I don't like a six shooter.  Like fucking Clint Eastwood.  I don't know, because it's six.  I'd rather have like nine or fucking ten.  Keep your gun clean.  Everything's nice.  Do they make an automatic handgun?  Like in a video game?  Like RoboCop.  His handgun.  Not allowed to own.  But they have them?  Auto pistol. 
[02:05:00]  Like a MAC-10 or a Tech-9.  No, like a fucking Desert Eagle.  Yeah, like in Call of Duty.  It's a machine pistol.  Do they have them?  Yeah, they got them.  But I mean, like I said, they're big and bulky usually.  It's not like you're going to get a nice small automatic.  They don't have a .44 machine gun.  You could probably make one.  Or a Glock machine gun.  A Glock.  A machine Glock.  A machine Glock.  They could be modified, I bet.  I don't know if they make them.  I don't know.  I've never looked into it because I can't own, you know, I'm not allowed to own anything 
[02:05:30]  automatic, full automatic.  Why not?  You're not going to trip anything up.  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  As fast as you pull the trigger, that's all I'm allowed.  Do you own a six-shooter?  Like a Western gun?  Yeah, I have two revolvers that I got in an auction.  The kind where you got a little bullet, each bullet?  Yeah, yeah.  Or the kind where you have the thing where you drop the whole thing?  No, the speed loader.  No, no, it's you open the gate.  Like an old West-style gun.  I got two of those six guns.  A six-shooter?  Yeah.  Click, click, click. 
[02:06:00]  You shut the gate.  Into the holster.  Do you have holster?  No.  Oh.  But, yeah, like that, you know, six-shooters.  Do you ever walk around listening to Bon Jovi naked with your guns on?  Well, yeah.  No, I never do that.  When I walk these streets.  But they put lists up, like, of who has, you know, permission to have a weapon.  Yeah, we can see what's up.  And Howard's in there. 
[02:06:30]  Imus is in there.  In what?  Hannity.  In what?  The list.  They put a list of Trump.  Of what?  Of people that are allowed to, uh.  Carry guns.  Toe a weapon around with them.  And officially good.  All those people have a license to carry.  And within a day, my name was on the list.  On the internet.  Who else is on there?  Who else is on there?  He just told you.  What's her name?  Yeah, uh, fucking Joan Rivers.  Joan Rivers.  Joan fucking Rivers.  Jesus.  Joan Rivers.  Are you kidding me?  She pulls the trigger.  I'm no kidding.  Her whole wrist bone will pop out of you. 
[02:07:00]  She's like.  She can't pull the trigger anymore, can she?  You ever get suicidal?  No.  You ever think about, like, you go.  You ever have him when I'm just gone?  I'm just gonna fucking blow my head off.  Never.  Oh, my God.  Wow, don't own a gun.  I am Mr.  Yeah, if Jesus.  If you got that thought.  Like, I've talked to Jimmy and stuff.  And Jimmy's been over the house.  And he's seen the, you know, the collection.  And he goes, I could not have a gun in my house.  There'd be a day.  Something would happen.  They would just find me with a shotgun in my mouth.  And fucking, you know. 
[02:07:30]  Fuck that.  If it didn't work, then, you know.  You're just sitting there with smelling that smoke.  Burnt flesh.  Tyler Durden?  Yeah, exactly.  Just like.  I'm not saying in terms of being a suicidal person.  But I mean, you just.  You get intrusive.  Thoughts.  What would it be like?  Just a fucking.  Like, I've shaved my mustache off before.  That's the same.  But I'm not saying.  I've been trimming my mustache.  And you're fucking off.  And I've had a thought that went. 
[02:08:00]  Shave that shit off, nigga.  And then you don't leave the house for five days.  Legit.  Right then.  Right when you're thinking.  You're just.  Just a thought that said.  Do it.  That's why.  I don't hold.  I don't hold.  Newborn babies.  Like, if anybody gives me a new.  Throw it.  Throw it.  Immediately.  Or throw it.  When I was 15.  It just.  Punt.  Yeah.  Throw this kid.  Yeah.  As far as you can.  Just in your head.  And I just like.  Do it. 
[02:08:30]  I don't like it.  But I've shaved my mustache.  I've done it once.  I've just shaved my mustache.  Does it look awful?  It looks.  I look dumb without a mustache.  I look stupid.  He looks like Victor.  Victor.  Half woman.  Half man.  Do you have a picture?  Of me without.  I look like Fantasia.  I look awful.  Awful.  Without a mustache.  But I'm just saying.  So I'm not saying you was just sitting around. 
[02:09:00]  But just like.  Have a pistol.  And just go.  Damn.  I don't know what it's like.  Just to shoot myself in the head.  Nah.  The thing.  The thing with guns are.  You understand.  The huge power it has.  And the.  In.  Immense responsibility of having one.  And.  Really?  Spider-Man?  Really?  Yeah.  I am Spider-Man.  Shut the fuck up.  They got this.  With great.  Great. 
[02:09:30]  Pistols.  With great responsibility.  I know.  I know you have a superhero outfit in your fucking house.  A fucking melodramatic monoclonal outfit.  You know why?  A shirt with an A on it.  I swear to you.  I'll be honest with you.  You don't.  You don't realize that until you own one.  Like.  Like.  You could go like.  Fuck you with that shit.  I got.  But the second you own one.  You start thinking.  This fucking thing.  Can kill people.  Fucking.  Like.  Dude.  If I had a fucking gun. 
[02:10:00]  You're just that type of person.  You really gotta kind of.  Dude.  I have a sword.  What's the person about it?  I have a sword at my house.  And I swing it around all the time.  What are you with a sword?  If I had a gun.  It would wind up just on the table.  I'd be careful at the beginning.  But then after a few months.  It'd be on the table.  I'd have a fucking.  Like if Martin Sheen should come over and chop you up with it.  You fucking.  As a.  As a.  Bobby's right though.  As a percentage.  Yeah.  As a percentage.  Of.  Of why you have a gun.  Yeah.  What's the percentage of protection?  The.  The percentage.  Percentage of protection? 
[02:10:30]  Probably.  90.  Yeah.  You haven't got 90% for protection?  Yeah.  Well.  No.  I.  I.  I enjoy shooting it too.  So it's.  It's.  I think it's kind of hard to.  You can't really do a.  Percentage.  Because like.  I enjoy.  So many.  I enjoy going to the range.  I enjoy shooting them.  They're fun.  But I.  I also enjoy that.  Yeah.  I.  I have the right to protect myself.  You never just leave it out at night.  And.  Fuck.  There's like.  You come down.  There's like a gun over there.  Never.  A gun over there.  That's pretty responsible. 
[02:11:00]  They get locked up.  I know exactly where they are.  For being a really irresponsible person.  He's really.  I am.  That's why.  I'm irresponsible with everything else.  Say everything again.  Everything.  Everywhere.  I.  Yeah.  I got like.  That's what's weird about Anthony.  When it comes to this gun though.  A safe.  Major.  Responsible.  It's alarmed.  Yeah.  Everything I mean.  You got a James Bond yourself in to fucking even see the goddamn things.  Dude.  I would leave it out all the time.  I would.  I would forget it on the table all the time.  You would be that guy.  Dude.  I leave plates and video games on. 
[02:11:30]  My computer on.  And if you have kids.  And you leave it around.  It's a crime.  Even if.  Even if they don't pick it up and fucking shoot themselves or you or something like that.  Yeah.  It's illegal to just leave it unattended.  Because I don't know.  Sometimes.  Really.  Well there's two different conversations going on.  Patrice has to me stuff.  You guys are talking.  No.  Which is fine.  Which is fine.  And I'm looking at Fantasia.  I want to.  Let me.  Can I just say something.  So perfect.  She was on TV.  She is my favorite.  That's my type of black girl.  Yeah.  Really?  Don't fuck you out of here.  That's my.  They get way better than Fantasia. 
[02:12:00]  Dude.  I like that.  African.  That African.  Oh fuck it up.  Bobby likes.  Bobby likes.  Black.  If he's going to be with a black girl.  Black.  It's going to be.  Black.  It's like a white guy.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  He'd rather be with like.  He likes Bushwoman.  Fucking Buffy.  Bobby wants to be with like Laquisha.  And that's what fucking Fantasia is.  You know what?  You did fuck it up.  She has Patrice's mouth.  Now you're fucked.  Now you're fucked it up for me.  Patrice was the same mouth.  I can just picture him going.  Bobby.  You want to fuck me?  I'll fuck you.  You motherfucker.  Patrice was asking me if I have a gun.  And I certainly do not.  Because of what Anthony was saying about Jimmy. 
[02:12:30]  And what Bobby was saying.  I just know.  Well you get to.  And you know jiu jitsu.  No.  I don't get the whole.  I want to shoot myself.  But I know I'm.  I'm irresponsible.  Temper.  Temper.  Temper.  No.  It's not even a temper thing.  I'll probably shoot myself in the foot by accident.  No I was kidding.  It's not a temper thing at all.  I just know that I'll be laying around.  I'll pick it up the wrong way.  And I'll shoot somebody in the fucking knee.  I'll be laying around.  I think about killing somebody.  But I don't have everything else laying around.  So what?  I'm going to put a.  I think about killing somebody. 
[02:13:00]  Every day.  Listen to me.  If I had a designated.  I would pray someone kick my door in.  So I'd go.  Oh.  I get to you.  I fucking.  I'm out last night.  Every time I walk my dog.  And I try to instill this in my fucking naive wife.  Who thinks we're living in Ohio.  You know.  You know.  Be careful.  I got a stun gun.  I got everything legally I could have.  And some illegal stuff.  I have a lighter that shoots out a knife that I carry.  Jesus Christ.  James Bond. 
[02:13:30]  Bobby has a knife that he twirls and it opens.  That's a butterfly knife.  Butterfly knife.  Fucking ninja stars.  I was out.  We're the misfits.  Yeah.  But I'm out last night.  There's a guy on the stoop next to me.  Drunk.  Talking.  Yelling at his girlfriend.  He doesn't live there.  Yeah.  He's just hanging out.  It's like 12 o'clock at night.  Walking my dogs.  And I walk out.  And I'm immediately thinking.  All right.  I'll grab that old Christmas tree.  And I will bash his head until I see fucking brain.  With a Christmas tree?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well they are laying around.  They're laying around all over New York. 
[02:14:00]  So you might as well use them for something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It was Christmas tree day yesterday.  Three.  Everybody.  But yeah.  I think about killing somebody all the time.  Like every day.  You probably.  I think about it.  You probably should not then own a firearm.  No.  Because I really.  So you're not homicide.  You don't think of.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Not like that.  Why would you think about killing yourself?  He's fucking in his mid-40s fucking 20 year olds.  In a gorgeous house.  I think about having superpowers all the time.  I didn't mean to offend you.  I think about having fucking some kind of X-Men power. 
[02:14:30]  And then I can kill somebody with.  X-Men power.  Now that would be cool.  To kill people with.  Yeah.  I don't think about it like the same for just.  It's just.  Yeah.  I really want to have Magneto's powers.  I just.  I just want to just.  I think about it all the time.  I wouldn't kill people.  I would just make people be respectful.  All right.  Like.  That's all I would do.  What an ass.  I would just.  You want people to beg for their lives.  Exactly.  I would take them up.  I actually thought about this.  I would take them up.  Up into the atmosphere.  And shake them.  And then. 
[02:15:00]  And then.  Like.  And then.  Like Hancock.  The little fat kid.  And he grabbed them and threw them back down.  I would do that.  Yeah.  And also freeze them to death.  When they update it.  Like.  The literal.  I forgot about Iron Man.  You bring an Iron Man to do it now.  That's right.  It's cold up there.  The scene from Iron Man.  You get too cold.  But you know what?  Bobby's not far off.  Because when you walk around New York City.  Bobby lives in the city.  I live in the city.  There's a lot of fucking assholes out there.  And you do.  I wish horrible things on them.  I was sitting outside.  For doing the dumbest things to you.  I talked to Matt Frost about this.  I'm sitting outside on my cell phone on a curb of a building. 
[02:15:30]  As I'm walking up.  I saw this hot young Asian girl.  And I looked at her.  Nothing.  Nothing crazy.  She looked at me.  She was kind of looking at me like she knew me.  Or she hated my guts.  But I chose she knew me.  Okay.  We all choose that.  Yeah.  I walk around.  She told me a story too.  She stops by me.  She's looking at me.  I'm on the phone talking to my manager.  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm not saying anything.  I'm talking about a gig or something.  Then out of nowhere.  She walks over.  With cringes her face up. 
[02:16:00]  And goes.  What the fuck did you just say to me?  You fucking.  I will fucking kill you.  What did you just say to me?  And I'm like.  I'm on the phone.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  She's like.  You fucking just said some racist fucking shit.  This girl was hot too.  This girl was a hot Asian young girl.  Holy shit.  Dude.  That's a hot story by the way.  I didn't know what to.  What did she hear?  She was.  Dude.  She heard Bobby going.  These gooks are always.  Just staring her in the face.  Honestly.  What is this. 
[02:16:30]  What is this.  Nip whore looking at.  This is what she said.  This is what he said.  She.  She flipped.  She.  She flipped out so bad.  I actually thought that I might be crazy.  Yeah.  That I might.  Like there's another part of me that does say you fucking gook.  Like I might be nuts.  Because she fucking snapped.  And she didn't.  She wasn't dirty.  She wasn't.  She was young.  Hot.  Asian girl.  Some crazy.  And she fucking.  And she's following me down the street.  She goes.  I will.  And it's either.  I'm going to fight this girl. 
[02:17:00]  I'm going to walk away.  And I chose.  Dude.  I didn't know what the fuck.  She.  Wow.  I will fucking step on your head.  And crush your fucking brain.  Some shit like that.  She hates being Asian.  Huh?  Wow.  She was fucked.  Dude.  Join the club.  Damn.  I hate her being Asian too.  The Asians bug me.  They bug me so much that that story would be bad for me.  Because they bug me.  Yeah.  I got to jump in.  One of my favorite things Patrice does is talk about the Asian restaurant owners and 
[02:17:30]  stuff.  Where you go to the same restaurant over and over again.  And they can't even give you a goddamn free egg.  Like dog shit.  They're seeing you for the first time.  I'm telling you.  Usually.  I mean when you're going out to a lot of restaurants in New York again.  You make relationships with some of these people.  And all of a sudden they go.  Hey.  I threw a little dessert in there for you and your wife.  Yep.  You know.  Just acknowledging that they see you a lot in their establishment.  Not them.  Not the Asian places though.  I'm going to tell you.  And I ain't bullshitting.  I tried to learn.  This is how much I don't like them. 
[02:18:00]  I tried to learn how to cook my own Chinese food.  So I don't have to go back to any of their restaurants.  And you find out it's not as easy as you think.  That's hard.  It fucking tastes like.  It does not taste like theirs.  They have special magic ingredients.  And you just go.  You motherfuckers.  Yeah.  They're just unfriendly.  I have Asian neighbors.  They just are unfriendly.  She doesn't pick her dog shit up.  She just is a mess.  And like.  But you got to be careful saying that now.  Because all the people you can tease back in the day. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  You can't tease them.  You can't tease them no more.  Now you got to watch your fucking mouth.  Yeah.  Asians wound up getting a powerhouse on their side.  So you got to be politically correct.  What?  Well they did.  Yeah.  They wound up getting like.  Yeah.  They got rights now.  A Reverend Al for Asian people.  Oh.  Fuck.  His name is like.  Wasn't it Gordon Liu?  No.  I'd say it's.  Liu.  What's the hell's his name?  He got elected to something though.  What?  John.  John Liu.  Chow Yun.  Chow Yun.  He got elected to an office now. 
[02:19:00]  He's like.  Chow Yun.  Chow Yun.  Wow.  Fat.  Chow Yun.  Fat.  Fucking two squiggly lines.  And a dot.  Jones.  You know what?  A tulip.  And a question mark.  With power.  You know what that?  I think we can segue into a little material here.  Because it's about political correctness.  You hear about this site.  Beautiful people dot com.  Genius.  Oh really?  You know the story then? 
[02:19:30]  Oh.  Genius.  I'll play it to get everyone on board.  God bless you.  And then we'll get Patrice's take on this.  God bless you.  Log on to the dating website beautiful people dot com and you won't find any ugly people.  Now according to the site's owners you won't find any fat ones either.  From November, which we all know Thanksgiving, all the way through New Year, members had been gaining weight instead of letting themselves go.  So the site dumped 5,000 subscribers who they say were indulged.  The website says it received complaints from members that there were too many quote fatties roaming around and not enough beauties. 
[02:20:00]  I just think that's horrible.  It's horrible.  Do you really think it's horrible?  Why is it horrible?  Yeah, tell me why it's horrible.  If you're going to beautifulpeople.com to hook up, it's like a matchmaking site.  Right.  You want beautiful people.  Why the fuck is it a bad thing that they don't want fat people on there?  And this site is running a business.  And they're realizing the fatties are hurting their business so they're taking care of that. 
[02:20:30]  And this is pretty much coming from a room full of people that ain't getting on that fucking site.  And I'm still sticking up for it.  Oh, my God.  I was thinking, can anybody?  I have to say.  You know what, though?  Bobby's beautiful, people.  Bobby just had a couple of unfortunate cosmetic things naturally happen to him.  Wait a minute.  Stop.  Bobby is gorgeous, man.  Believe in my head.  Bobby, you used to be old school Bobby with a dog.  You used to have it going on, Bobby.  You used to have it going on. 
[02:21:00]  And your face is having trouble getting square again.  You lost a lot of weight.  Listen, listen.  I will be.  I understand what you're saying.  Let me address this.  You used to be beautiful, man.  Wait, stop.  We got it.  Bobby, I remember those days, too.  Down at the center.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but that's not even my beautiful days.  You met me at the end.  Dude, when I was fucking.  I met you when it was all falling apart.  When you knew me.  Dude, when I was in Al and the Monkeys.  Yeah.  Back in Boston.  Were you getting some.  Dude.  Bobby was gorgeous, man. 
[02:21:30]  I fucked witches from Salem.  And survived.  That's how fucking beautiful you are.  The only motherfucker prettier than Bobby was Nick DiPaolo.  No.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick was a good looking guy.  Oh my God.  Was beautiful.  His fucking eyelashes.  Have you ever seen his eyelashes?  The bitterness like fucking drained.  That motherfucker was beautiful, man.  Dude.  Fucking.  Oh my God.  Beautiful.  Now that's not even beautiful, Bobby.  That's not even.  Dude.  That's you?  That's you?  That's Bobby?  That's Bobby. 
[02:22:00]  That's not.  That's more gorgeous than that.  Dude, I was way.  That's like middle-aged Bobby.  That's you?  Yeah, but that's not.  You have all your hair.  Yeah, but that's not.  No, you don't.  His hairline.  If you see his hairline.  No, that's what I had.  It's not going to look like picnic basket hairline.  I had to make.  I've heard that before.  I had to.  I had to make.  I had to make hair.  Oh, shit.  I had to take.  This is what I had to do.  I needed an hour before I went out in that photo.  I had to fucking hang my head upside down, let the curls get wet, and then dry them with 
[02:22:30]  hairspray, and then flip them back, and then make them.  Creatively, you were moving them off.  Yeah, because I.  It was like a pompadour, but it didn't go off your head.  It was on the sides.  It was like on the sides.  I had to comb over on both sides.  Oh, shit.  But you comb up.  I had to comb up.  Before the rooster looked.  Oh, wow, man.  I mean.  Wait, wait, wait.  But let's get back to Patrice.  What were the problems with Bobby?  The hair, obviously.  Bobby lost his hair.  Yeah.  And Bobby's face got round, but he lost weight, but he can't get the square face. 
[02:23:00]  No, because I'm not.  I guarantee you this.  I guarantee you this.  Let me just guarantee you this.  There's no face exercises, nigga.  There's no face exercises.  It's PX-90 for the face.  I love a good guarantee that I'll never have to get you, Bobby.  I have a guarantee.  I will be fucking sexy.  I will be sexy one more time in my life. 
[02:23:30]  One more time?  One more time in my life, you will see me where you go, you know what, Bobby?  You're sexy again.  I think, Bob, you've done wonders with what after fucking-  With what I have?  What am I, an old car?  My knee man?  After fucking, I'm a knee man, and he fucking had to gain weight and stuff.  Bobby's fucking back to, as far as I'm concerned, he's back to normal, but Bobby's not going  to be old Bobby. 
[02:24:00]  I wish I could find a picture.  Dane has a video.  Nick is probably the best looking motherfucker I know in terms of comedians.  He's such a good looking guy.  I mean, look at Nick's, you say that, but then look at Nick's eyes.  The evil?  In one of his photos.  In one of his photos, his eyes-  Well, one isn't half shut and twitching from anger.  But that's all the racism.  That's back in the blind.  You can't count that shit.  Racism sweat.  I say in this room, I think Opie can get on all beautiful people.  I think.  No offense to you, Ed. 
[02:24:30]  No, no.  I mean, I, you know.  I got my own.  Yeah, but Opie, you know what?  That's all starting to fall apart in front of your eyes.  There's some people, like, I was saying this to somebody the other day.  The bus line is starting.  Oh, damn.  There's some people, that's not even gorgeous Bobby.  I'm just looking at it.  It doesn't look like you, though.  That's what's so fucked up.  Jeez, look at the jaw.  But look at the fucking-  Yeah, yeah, you do.  You have a jaw like a fucking-  Look at the confidence.  We haven't seen that in a long time.  Like an action hero.  What are you talking about?  I was at the fucking Madison Square Garden, you fucking idiot.  You have a Superman jaw.  Remember that confidence you shit had?  You have a fucking Superman jaw right there. 
[02:25:00]  Clark Kent fucking-  Jesus.  Yeah, but that's not even fucking good-looking Bobby.  Wait, wait.  We're not even hearing the sound, right?  But what's happening in this-  Please don't fucking do the sound.  Listen, what's happening is the crowd, the girls wouldn't stop clapping for-  I don't get that anymore.  I don't get that.  It's like a little wimpy name, ain't it?  Massachusetts.  Oh, this is-  Oh, please.  How did this happen to do this?  You know what, Danny?  I hope you-  Danny, I hope you fucking slip on some shit today. 
[02:25:30]  Danny will find anything, man.  Except that the volume's a little lower.  You were ready for a beating.  No, no, no.  They were clapping the girls.  All the women.  It's the girls.  They're all sitting up-  Masturbating in their seats.  They're all sitting up straight.  Some of the guys.  He said one joke.  Massachusetts sucks, and they'd clap it.  Dude, I used to be a twink.  Ladies, Irish, guys.  I look like a little Mexican dishwasher, but-  It's true.  Look at the girls.  Oh, look at them like-  Oh, no.  That ain't my power.  I'm doing it myself. 
[02:26:00]  Look, you got guns on you and stuff.  You're doing it, Hans.  Come on, help out this, eh?  He's holding the mic, and he's got like a muscle.  Look at my fucking broken nose.  A little pug boxer nose.  And you're starting to get a gut.  No.  Let me just say something.  The trees brings it back to reality.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  This-  Fat fuck.  I'll be honest.  This is beginning of a fat fuck.  No, no, no, no.  This is after my first fat.  What?  Really?  How many fats have you had?  I've had six fats.  You're counting, right?  No, no.  Seven fats.  Seven fats. 
[02:26:30]  I had a fat when I was in-  Wait a minute.  I'll tell you.  My first fat-  After my stepdad, the one that used to beat the shit out of me and stuff.  Yeah, I was your first fat.  When my mom left him, when my mom left him, I got fat.  Because I don't know, we moved into like a two-bedroom apartment.  We ate fucking just rice and chicken, like in tuna and shit like that.  Sounds like you shouldn't get fat from that.  Dude, no, believe me.  I just fucking was a fat mousse.  Yeah?  And then I blew up, and then my teacher, Mr. DiPersio, became my dad. 
[02:27:00]  I wish he did.  That was another guy for a steak.  But he became like my dad.  He came to the dad potluck supper, but he was a jogger, so I wanted to be like his son.  So I started jogging.  And I lost all the weight.  I ran like a marathon, five-mile marathon.  He came in ninth.  I remember we did the 420, and he was like, I want you to win, Kelly.  And I won.  But I was like the fat-  You won for him.  It was weird.  That was my first fat.  So neat.  That was my sixth fat.  Oh, fucking terrible. 
[02:27:30]  I've been looking for a dad ever since.  But that's my sixth fat.  That's my fifth fat.  The smiling girls.  How many fats you got left in you?  I got two more fats.  I got-  I'm going to get into shape.  Probably next time you see me by the summer, I'll be-  Because I said fuck it a month ago.  After Thanksgiving, somebody gave me a nipple.  Have you ever had a nipple?  What's a nipple?  A nipple is a pretzel with a white chocolate Hershey kiss. 
[02:28:00]  Melt it, and then you put a fucking M&M on top of it.  I fucking lost my mind.  They sell these things?  No, you make them.  You make them?  I fucking lost-  I had a nipple, and I just went-  I've been fucking ballistic ever since.  Good shit, man.  I just got my shit back together.  Oh, dude.  I went to the Colons.  Oh, fucking nipple.  You want a nipple in?  Let's get some nipples.  I'm going to-  Yeah, make some of the-  Nipples.  Can we make some nipples?  Yeah.  I'm going to get into shape, and then I'm going to get fat again, so-  I don't think those are too hard to make, really.  That sounds good.  No, you get the-  You got to get the-  They're really, really good. 
[02:28:30]  You got to get the mesh pretzels.  Yeah, exactly.  The mesh pretzel.  They're at your house.  Why don't you-  How about peanut butter pretzels?  Yeah.  Really good, man.  Peanut butter, you can't fuck with that.  They're great.  But anything better than that?  If I went to see Bobby based on his-  You're still looking at Bobby.  And I came to his show, say, I seen this kid, and he's over here, this Robert Kelly.  The first thing I would go is, oh, my God, what happened to him?  Oh, shit.  Like, if you saw me-  Wait a minute.  If you saw me now?  If I looked at-  How old-  How long ago is that?  I got to go see Bobby, a year and a half. 
[02:29:00]  A year and a half ago?  How long is this?  You fucking idiot.  How long is this?  How long ago is this clip we're looking at?  That's a fucking long time ago.  It wasn't that long, because this is the last season of Premium.  No, it wasn't.  Are we talking 10 years?  It wasn't 10 years ago.  No.  Stop.  No.  Hang on.  I'll tell you why.  Because I lived in-  We're looking at-  I lived in L.A.  I had a fly-in from L.A. for that.  I lived in L.A. maybe eight years ago. 
[02:29:30]  Maybe eight or nine.  Look at this fucking crowd.  All women just loving it.  This is Premium Blend?  Yeah, Premium Blend.  Who's the host?  You killed my kids.  I don't know who the fuck was that.  Was it David Allen Greer?  I don't know.  I killed my kids.  Maybe.  Is that who you are?  Are you the pissed at hand?  2002, probably.  2000-  No.  No, because it was before September 11th.  Wait a minute.  Is that when I was over your house and you cooked?  You was that guy?  You know, that's why I moved back from L.A., right?  You was that guy.  Do you understand that?  That's why I moved back. 
[02:30:00]  Because when I was in L.A., that was my fifth fat or my fourth fat in L.A.  I was out there.  I booked a pilot.  I thought I was going to be famous.  Never went anywhere.  Fucking stayed in L.A.  Wondered up fucking watching the Food Network every day and started cooking shit.  He came over to my house to stay with me and I was-  I knew how to cook everything.  But my specialty was barbecue chicken.  I knew how to flip it at the right time, three minutes, three minutes, two minutes, two minutes, one and a half minute, one and a half minute, 50 seconds.  And it was perfect, juicy barbecue chicken. 
[02:30:30]  And I had this barbecue sauce.  He came over.  He's eating my chicken.  He goes, Bobby, you got to move the fuck back to New York.  I'm like, why?  He goes, this is the best barbecue chicken I've ever had in my life.  You're a cook, motherfucker.  Get the fuck out of here.  I said, no one should be able to- you should not be able to make chicken as good.  That means you're not working.  You're not working, right.  You're spending time cooking.  This is too delicious.  My wife would wake up in the middle of the night and have Cornish game hens with fucking almond sauce. 
[02:31:00]  That's depression, man.  You learn how to cook like that.  That's terrible.  You learn how to cook, learn how to make fucking curry chicken and you're just, mmm, delicious.  And you have no one to invite over.  I have the entire pot in between my legs and I'm eating, I have the rice on a spoon and  I dip the rice in the pot with the sauce and the chicken and I'm just fucking, I'm like,  I got to get a fucking job.  I did that with a, I made a pie one night. 
[02:31:30]  I did the same shit.  I made a pie at like three in the, dude, I went to Ralph's at three in the morning.  I had this invention that I was going to do, uh, chocolate pudding, no chocolate, then  vanilla pudding, then, uh, vanilla chocolate, uh, white chocolate, then chocolate pudding  and then whipped cream.  I made the graham cracker crust myself by scratch.  I woke my wife up.  She got mad at me and she went back to bed.  I ate it by myself with my dogs on the fucking couch.  I didn't give them any cause they fucking died.  Damn it.  Unbelievable. 
[02:32:00]  Let's get to part two of the beautiful people.com website.  Those who didn't meet the beauty benchmark received an email explaining they had been  expelled because of their extra pounds, some tips on working out and an invitation to reapply  when they slimmed down.  Body image expert, Karen Salmonstone says the website's harsh rejection could be damaging  even to people who aren't on it.  I think it's kind of actually scary, you know, that they would kick off people because they  they've packed on a couple of pounds over the holidays. 
[02:32:30]  It's a, it's a wrong message.  I mean, chemistry is such a mysterious thing.  Those behind beautiful people.com make no apologies and say what their site lacks in  political correctness.  It makes up for in honesty.  Yeah.  I like the honesty.  There's, there's gotta be a fat people.com out there.  Go there.  Yeah.  It's called everything else.  Go there for your chemistry.  There is a fat, a fat website.  It's a business and they, they should run it how they, you know, see fit.  And I don't think fat people, um, should, I'm serious. 
[02:33:00]  I don't think fat people should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a placeholder.  Okay.  Okay.  But it's called, they do have a fat couple like hookups, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about fat fucks.com?  Let's see what comes up.  Something will come up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A porn site, right?  It just is fat fucks, fat porn, fat sex.  Do they have tubby cunts?  Oh, do they have tubby cunt.com?  It's not, it's this whole day.  No matter, no matter what you have. 
[02:33:30]  Is that tubby cunt or is that fat fuck?  Oh, look at this.  Let me see.  Can I see if I get into this?  I don't know if I like fat chicks.  It's not really fat.  You would go, you would definitely go there.  I've been with fat.  Dude, I was with some big, big girls.  Really?  I was with a girl, I was with a black girl in Huntsville, Texas that I had a hold her tit with  two hands.  Yeah.  Just a fucking enormous tit.  Big tit.  Big.  I got on top of her and it was like being on an upside down canoe. 
[02:34:00]  Both of my knees didn't hit the bed.  The funniest fat girl story I've ever had.  It was this girl, I used to, you know, back in the day we was real disrespectful.  You would just call the girls where you met them or where they lived.  Like Canal Street?  And I'd call her, you know, the fat girl from The Wiz.  She used to work at The Wiz.  Remember The Wiz?  Like that?  The fat girl from The Wiz.  Because I had just got back from Australia.  Dude, I remember the fat girl from The Wiz.  The fat girl from The Wiz.  That's so fucked up. 
[02:34:30]  I remember.  I remember the fat girl from The Wiz.  She flipped out, right?  Dude, she was a soldier.  And I met her when I first moved to Jersey City.  First in like 99.  And we talked and I brought her home and we was talking about the pocket rocket.  Because I bought this girl that I met in Australia a pocket rocket and was going to send it to her.  And the fat girl from The Wiz was like, I use that.  That's the G4.  They go, the G4. 
[02:35:00]  And I go, yeah.  We were talking.  We was going about the pocket rocket.  We end up talking.  She comes over the house.  We fucking go at it, right?  So I used to live and have a roommate.  And I mean, I learned a lot of my debauchery from this girl.  I have to say.  The fat girl from this.  Yeah.  A lot of the horrible shit that I learned to do to girls.  From that girl?  It's just because she would lay there and let it happen.  I just would do.  I'm not proud of it because I wouldn't want to do that to my daughter.  But I would just do some terrible things there and she just enjoyed it. 
[02:35:30]  Is that the one that ate your ass?  She did everything, dude.  Really?  Oh, she just used to call and go, can you do that fist thing you do?  Oh, shit.  That was the worst thing you've ever shown me.  Huh?  You had a fist thing that you did?  Just not.  I fucking hate that.  Get in there and dig around.  He showed me a picture of that once.  Like you're punching a fucking...  Like you're punching a muffet.  And he showed me the picture as he's pulling it back out. 
[02:36:00]  So like some of the inside was like outside.  But it was a vagina.  It looked like he punched a fucking plasma wall.  She comes over the house.  She comes over the house.  We have a mission.  So I try to sneak her out the house.  I'm like, let's go.  Let's go.  So we're sneaking down the spiral staircase.  And my roommate is down on the phone.  He's on the phone.  He's like, yeah, how you doing, man?  And then he looks up.  And he sees me and her just leaving.  And he looks up.  He goes, hey, how you guys doing?  And he's talking on the phone.  I walk down the stairs.  And I walk back upstairs. 
[02:36:30]  He's on the floor laughing.  He's laughing.  When he said, when he took the phone off his head, I went, hey, how you guys doing?  My stomach.  I said, this motherfucker.  I walk back upstairs.  He was in tears crying.  Patrice, did you think he was going to let you slide at all when you're walking down?  No.  Because he said, how you guys doing? 
[02:37:00]  And I was coming down the stairs, nigga.  Like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.  The coast is clear.  But in terms of this fucking beautiful people thing, when I go, look, the TSA downstairs today  when I came in, when you're a visitor, the security guards have to let you in.  And I'm waiting for the guy to come over.  It's a fat guy leaning on the window and comes over to let me in. 
[02:37:30]  He's just late.  He's just...  Fat people shouldn't be able to have certain privileges, man.  And I'm going to tell you, and being a fat motherfucker, there's many a times that I want to figure out how to catch a nap  when I'm not supposed to, like during non-nap times where it's just like, if I'm supposed to be doing something,  and I'm just like, man, I would love to just go someplace and be asleep based on being fat, based on being tired. 
[02:38:00]  And I just, I agree with this website, man.  I agree with what they did.  I agree with what they're doing in terms of fucking...  Look, fat people should be discriminated against from time to fucking time, man.  They're an inconvenience.  You added fucking time to fucking time.  I mean, the buying two seats thing, I fucking...  For me, I do.  I mean, I don't want...  You buy two seats?  If I can't afford first class, sometimes first class, three Gs.  It's just crazy. 
[02:38:30]  But if I can't afford first, I'll buy two coach for $3.25, man, $6.50.  But they fucked with you on that, though.  I got that whole fucking thing.  They fucked with you one time because they wanted to give that seat to a stewardess, right?  Oh, and she said, is someone sitting here, one of those stewardesses that get on when there's no seats?  Is someone sitting here?  And I go, yep.  The other half of me.  And the other half of me, my ass, I fold it down and fit it, and I'm arrogant.  I put my hat, my fucking bag right there, and the other person that sits there is looking miserable, 
[02:39:00]  and I try to help them out.  I go, I'm real arrogant.  I go, nobody will be there, my friend.  Bullet fucking pistol.  Because I bought it.  But the lady goes, I pull out two tickets.  I buy two seats, man, because I need it.  I just need two seats.  Some of these fat people can't.  You're on the brink of needing two seats.  I don't think you officially need two seats yet. 
[02:39:30]  You're not one of those people that are like, oh, fuck.  I'm not a two-seater, but I am a deep, breathtaking someone next to me.  If I'm walking down the aisle, we used to say, motherfuckers just like, Lord, please don't let this giant nigga sit next to me.  And you start praying, like, oh, please, no, please, please, please, no.  Me and Patrice used to take the fucking Peter Pan to New York from Boston.  Oh, that buzz? 
[02:40:00]  And I'd be jammed in.  I would just be jammed in on the seat next to him with my head on his fucking shoulder.  It's like, and we both couldn't care.  It was like, ah, fuck it.  Go ahead.  Take a nap, Bobby.  Take a napkin in here.  All right, listen, why don't we take a break?  Please, shit.  Hey, Patrice, you were gone for like a month and a half.  Did you see Avatar?  Yes.  I want to get your thoughts on it next.  All right.  Go ahead.  I mean, it's the biggest movie, like, they're saying ever at this point.  So let's see what you thought of it after the break. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  And other movies.  You see any other movies over break?  I've seen a few.  What am I, fucking chopped liver?  I've seen Jill.  I'm working with you two, Bobby.  I've seen a new movie with Jill Nicolini.  Whoa, shit.  Wait, she's in a new movie?  Apparently, my chances now of getting one last blast is pretty much over.  And I'm trying to talk to Anthony about breakup sex.  Bobby, you know what breakup sex is, right?  Uh, nope.  Never had it.  See, that's why I go back to Patrice.  Patrice, you know, I've never had breakup sex.  I know what breakup sex is, Hopi. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  Why is Bobby being difficult?  Bobby, did you see any movies during the break?  I saw Avatar.  All right, we'll get your thoughts on Avatar, too.  No, Patrice.  We're the movie guy.  He sees every fucking guy.  The fuck, he's not the movie.  I've seen it, too.  He's seen way more movies than you ever have.  We're both the lonely guy.  Patrice, how many movies have you seen in the last month?  Be honest.  Probably seven.  Oh, that's not that.  I've seen 18.  All right, Bobby wins.  Bobby can't name three.  Yeah, I can.  We're going to figure it all out next.  Jeremiah Johnson.  Stay there.  Stay there.  Bye. 
[02:41:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  That's what I'm doing.  That's what I'm saying.  Shut up.  I have that little gold badge.  You know the cops give you the gold actual badge.  It's a mini badge.  Yeah.  I panicked so bad.  This is what a faggot I am.  I flipped my wallet open and shouldered that.  Like that was going to stop her. 
[02:42:00]  Stop her from yelling?  I just, I went like this.  And she probably went to the police department and was like,  you've got a racist cop.  Hey, let's go to the phone and start our movie discussion.  The new space pen?  Fucking unbelievable.  The pen.  It, it, it, it racks upside down.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  They use it in space.  What void is the space pen filling?  What void is the space pen filling?  It's the most, it's the most fluid writing pen ever. 
[02:42:30]  I was wondering why you kept, why that pen just kept showing up.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  It's a gag pen.  Oh, yeah.  And electric sound.  You just, you just, you just went, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  It made my son tingle.  I wonder why I've seen that pen.  I've seen that pen too much today.  What are you doing?  Are you just making it together, Buzz?  That would have stopped Patrice's heart.  Thank God you didn't do it to Patrice.  And you're the only guy, because he tried to give it to, ah, fucking Kenny. 
[02:43:00]  He goes, hey, write, write your address.  I'm going to send you something.  Kenny goes, I'll text it.  He won't even text.  Stupid pen.  He texted it and emailed it to me.  I think Kenny has to take off to go to Dallas, but if, is he still here?  Kenny.  Because watch, he'll do it.  And he, you won't even get a reaction.  No, no.  That was a good one.  That's a, that was a shock.  It was pretty good.  Yeah, it went from my, went from my thumb knuckle.  All right, Kenny, before you leave.  This is a tip of my thumb.  This is a gag pen.  What does he have to do to get the shock?  Wait, get a mic on him. 
[02:43:30]  All right, okay, I get it.  We get it.  Now you make, it hurts me.  It hurts me.  Okay, okay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Is this something fucking, did you make him?  Let's do it for the radio, though.  Do it for the radio, Ken.  All right.  So you're supposed to feel a shock and jump.  Yeah, listen.  And that's in your hand, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you feeling at all?  Anything?  I'm tickled.  Is it electric or is it a vibration?  Can you take a home?  All right, hold on.  Let Danny do it.  I never did. 
[02:44:00]  I never used one.  I don't use weapon.  There's no honor in it.  Could you take it?  Can you take it?  I don't know.  I never used one.  Hold on.  I want Danny to do it.  It didn't hurt, but he did get a fucking full erection.  Danny, get it.  All right, I'll give it a whirl.  A whirl?  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  You can do that again, please.  And Kenny just held the button down.  You know what?  Because the way that Kenny was reacting, I figured that it must not feel like anything  at all.  But there's definitely a little something there.  Try it again.  Try it again.  Try it again. 
[02:44:30]  Obey, try it.  You gotta try it.  You gotta try it.  You gotta try it.  I know.  It's nothing.  It's a good one, though.  Oh, shit.  We should have been recording that one.  That was fucking...  Obey threw it.  Obey threw it.  He threw his fucking soul out of his chest.  He threw his shit.  Dude, for real.  Dude, you balanced on your asshole on the chair.  Patrice?  Oh, shit.  You wanna try?  Hang on.  I've just seen everybody scream. 
[02:45:00]  Hang on.  Hang on.  Kenny's the toughest guy in here.  Kenny, hold down the bar.  I'm fucking the guy.  Watch what Kenny does.  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Hang on, hang on.  I'm gonna get a moment.  Kenny doesn't do anything.  He doesn't fucking move.  Wait, is it on?  No.  Tell me when.  All right, we'll put your two big...  No, we wanted it on mic, too, for the audio.  Watch.  We all let go after a split second.  Kenny just holds it down.  Ready, set, go.  Wow.  I know.  I was like, wow.  I could never...  No.  I thought I was gonna be able to do that. 
[02:45:30]  Patrice, for real.  It gives you a little, like, what the fuck.  You get a little, like, what the fuck.  But I don't think the voltage...  I think the shock, the immediate shock...  I'm done.  I'm done, too, Bobby.  Just try it one more time, Ope.  No fucking way.  Just one more time.  Ope's reaction was just...  He just fucking helped.  Ope's was great.  He's the big trickster and brought in the pen.  Yeah.  Why don't you fucking...  Why don't you do it?  Huh?  Yeah, you can do it.  You can do it, prankster.  Yeah, now we...  Yeah, we'll film you doing it.  All right, go ahead, hold this. 
[02:46:00]  You know how to do this.  Is it running?  No, not yet.  Okay, then I gotta fucking...  Hold on.  I'm a fucking whack-a-man.  Hold on, you'll have a nice video for your Twitter.  I gotta hit record.  Is it recording?  Oh, fuck it.  All right, now Bobby, go.  We saw Kenny, now Bobby, you go.  It's your pen.  But I know what it does!  We all...  Yeah, but it's easier when you don't know what it does.  Kenny's done it three or four times.  He knows what it does.  Yeah, but I know what it does.  It's like jumping into a pool.  It's your fucking pen.  Shut up.  All right, ready?  Yeah.  I can't fucking do it. 
[02:46:30]  I can't fucking...  I'm afraid he's gonna throw the fucking pen right at my head.  Go ahead, Bobby.  I can't fucking do it.  Do it.  I'll set.  Are you pressing it?  No, hold it down, you faggot.  Do it.  No, no, no!  All right, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.  You better do it or Kay's gonna make you.  I fucking hate getting electrocuted.  Fuck, that's the worst feeling ever.  Yeah, how is Kenny doing that?  I don't know how Kenny does it.  There's no way you can hold on to this pen. 
[02:47:00]  Geek.  If I just did that, he died.  Oh, God, he probably would.  Thumb's going off.  It's just a room full of sissies.  This is for Kenny.  Patrice, for real, you can't hold on to it.  You have to let go of it immediately.  Dude, where did it get?  Was it just your thumb?  It went all the way up to my elbow.  I must have hit something.  Mine just went from thumb knuckle to the tip of my thumb.  And you had to let go immediately.  Kenny is...  Kenny should have two of these sticking out of his neck.  Steve, you're a big guy.  You try it.  Let's see if it's a big guy.  All right, wait, let me get you.  Hang on.  Go ahead.  You didn't get my reaction. 
[02:47:30]  Hang on.  I don't want to do that again.  See?  Yeah, Steve jumped, too.  Oh, wow.  That's the second time.  He got me the first time with it.  Let's try to hold it down.  We should try...  Let's try...  Get E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Stupid E-Rock.  Let's get Kenny's protege,  to be as good as Kenny.  Let's see if he can take it.  He should have put that dog collar on Kenny, man.  He probably would have been able to take it.  Yes, he's anonymous.  That dog collar we should have put on Kenny,  like on his leg or arm.  I hope we...  Because Kenny can...  Kenny's fucking...  I hope people understand what's just happening. 
[02:48:00]  Kenny just held down the button.  That's insane.  Yeah, it gives you a pretty good shot.  Because your reaction is to let go immediately.  Dude, you fucking jumped off...  Yeah, your face...  You bounced off your asshole.  I didn't expect it to be like that.  I didn't expect it to be like that.  If I could have got that on video.  Here's E-Rock.  It's a virus, as we like to call it.  E-Rock, now, for real,  Kenny held this button down.  Try to hold it down as long as you can.  Hold it down as long as you can.  Kenny can hold it down almost indefinitely.  Oh, wow.  A second.  All right, come on, go.  Oh, wow. 
[02:48:30]  That's pretty impressive.  I'm going with the other hand now.  E-Rock freaking did it for like three seconds.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  He's shaking.  That's pretty good, though.  Kenny, when you hold it down,  can I touch your hand and see what's going on?  Oh.  What?  I wonder if that works.  Wait, I wonder if the...  No, no, no.  Yeah.  No.  No?  There's no voltage.  It's just something else.  He just has mind over matter, man.  He just...  That's that martial arts. 
[02:49:00]  You have to have a mind to matter.  You have to have a mind over matter.  Fucking Kenny.  You can do it now?  I'll do it again.  Here it goes, Steve.  Once you get by a certain...  All right.  Yeah.  Once you get by a certain threshold...  The initial...  Yeah, you can...  All right, Bobby, you do it now.  No, no.  Electricity fucks me up.  What's the battery?  It's inside.  I'm not a fan.  I assumed it was inside.  It's over there.  It's wireless battery. 
[02:49:30]  It's from Samsung.  I got a new from fucking Vegas.  Fucking Kenny.  It's the new Palm fucking battery electric phone.  Shocker.  What are you going to do?  Just kidding.  I'll tell you this.  When I was a small child,  I did stick a screwdriver in an electrical socket once,  and I got shocked,  and I was afraid to go to sleep  because I thought I was going to die.  If you went to sleep?  Yeah.  What kind of science fiction is that?  I don't know.  I was a small child.  Oh. 
[02:50:00]  So you haven't slept since?  Right.  I put tweezers in the socket.  Wow.  But I was holding it so far back  that it shorted out  because the metal touches,  so it shorted out.  But if I would have been holding it  before the metal comes together...  You know what I like to do?  What?  I like to stick knitting needles up my asshole.  He's just...  All righty.  Why bother, Ed?  Why bother?  He just sees pinwheels wherever he goes.  Fucking Kenny.  Can we put it... 
[02:50:30]  Can we, like, splash water on his hand  and then have him do it?  Oh.  We'll make it more conductive.  Let's lick batteries now.  Oh.  Put it on your tongue.  Oof.  Oh, remember that 9-volt battery?  Watch that.  Oh, when you put a fucking 9-volt battery on your tongue?  That hurts.  It gives you a weird, tingly...  Have Kenny do it on his tongue.  Let's see how brave he really is.  We should have him do it on his temple.  Great.  He starts just reciting Shakespeare...  Yeah, it made him smarter.  ...and math.  Let's go to Toronto.  We're going to go to the phones. 
[02:51:00]  Anthony, Dan in Toronto wants in.  Dan.  Hello.  Hello.  La, la, la.  Did you get your bucket on?  Yeah.  Dr. Parnassus, that movie you were talking about the other day, it's only on four screens.  Yeah.  This Friday, it opens wide.  It does.  It opens Friday wide.  Did you see the movie?  Not yet.  Not yet?  Okay.  I kind of liked it.  Did you see the Heath Ledger thing?  Punch-Up. 
[02:51:30]  Parnassus.  I think.  Dr. Parnassus or whatever.  Parnassus.  Yes.  All right, Avatar.  Patrice, obviously, is the big movie.  I saw it.  Did you see 3?  All right, let's slow down.  No, I didn't see 3D.  What do you mean you didn't see 3D?  Oh, you got a thing?  3D.  I just saw it.  So, um...  Don't want to listen to you, then.  We only have to talk about it.  What is it?  Because you got to see the 3D.  I thought...  It's all in 3D.  The way I saw it, it was, um... 
[02:52:00]  Quite frankly, look, 3D now isn't...  First of all, it isn't like Jaws 3, where they just show a fucking finger.  Fucking finger coming at you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a process now.  It's filmed in a way.  Right.  I saw it was great.  The fucking movie, I was torn.  It was in a genre, okay?  I said generally it might be one of the best movies I ever saw.  Hmm.  Um, it was deep, because basically what they did, uh, was the concept of the movie, the 
[02:52:30]  story was decent.  It wasn't...  I thought it would be a lot of Titanic-y shit, but the love was like, you wanted it to...  You go, I'm into this love story.  Um, they basically changed, um, black people, Asian people, Mexicans, uh, and the downtrodden  and oppressed of this world...  Yeah.  ...into giant, uh, blue things.  Okay, so there...  Okay, so...  And white people stayed the same.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  White people are bad guys, I'm sure. 
[02:53:00]  What made it a great movie, I think, in a genre?  In a...  In its genre, where you put it like in a Star Wars kind of genre, probably as good as Star  Wars.  Mm-hmm.  It's as good as that.  It's probably one of the best, if not the best movie in that genre.  Is it in the top 20 all time of any genre?  No.  I don't...  I don't think it is.  I would say no.  But, from top to bottom, never bored, even the slow...  The slow shit, interesting.  Interesting, whatever they did as a process to make the animated characters act, it was 
[02:53:30]  Zoe Saldana's thing that she was, tremendous, the white boy who was crippled and turned into  the avatar, which is the blue thing, or whatever they wanted...  Tremendous, even fucking Sigourney Weaver, who's now an old lady now.  She was great.  She's fucking...  She's great in this movie.  The evil general...  It was, in terms of a movie, fantastic. 
[02:54:00]  I would...  You can't beat it, man.  This fucking...  This fucking James Cameron, he has to be talked about as...  In the argument, it's one of the best, man.  You know what, you know what, that movie, and I'm getting sick of it when they do this  in every fucking movie now, I hate when they make the fucking marines in America these  fucking...  We're the shit hunk of fucking douchebag people that don't give a fuck about anything and 
[02:54:30]  we just blow up a fucking tree and kill everyone.  Fuck you.  We can't even fucking kill anybody.  We have to send a rocket through a window and hit the exact guy we're supposed to hit.  We can't kill anybody.  We're fucking ruined.  No collateral damage anymore.  Make it a fucking...  Make it Arabs.  Make it fucking terrorists that will just go in and blow up a tree of life.  To be fair, I understand what you're saying, but to be fair, the movie essentially is...  It's, again, it was a spoon-feeding of American history. 
[02:55:00]  Right, right.  Without...  It's just...  It is what it is, Bobby.  The big, giant, blue people were Indians or Africans or the Irish back in the day.  They were just old press people and even though we're doing it in some new age thing, the  history of America is to do that.  They weren't oppressed.  It's basically a historic.  They weren't oppressed.  They were fine.  Those things weren't oppressed?  They were fine.  They were only not oppressed because they were thousands...  They were 10,000 feet tall.  They were giant things. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, but they weren't oppressed.  They were fine where they were living.  That's the way they lived.  No, the people...  Nigga, did you see the movie?  Did you see the bulldozers just like knocking down what would be their homes?  They taught them English.  They really spoke a goongy, boogie, ba-ba-ba, but they came in...  What did they speak?  Booby, boo-boo.  And they came in and they taught them English.  That's how long they had been there fucking fucking up their land.  Dude, how impressive was the made-up language?  Oh, what the...  Sigourney Weaver is talking this made-up language thing. 
[02:56:00]  Better than Klingon?  It was impressive.  You thought you were listening to some fucking foreign language.  All that stuff makes sense.  He actually wrote a language.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, all that shit's crazy.  Yeah, real shit.  He fucking...  That movie is...  It fucking was spectacular, but when I tweet it...  Do it again and go IMAX.  Deal with the crowd, go IMAX.  Get the goofy fucking oversized 3D glasses.  You gotta watch it with the glasses?  Hell fucking yeah.  Yeah, you have to. 
[02:56:30]  But it is fucking amazing.  Dude, it's a fucking...  And the glasses aren't stupid glasses.  They're pretty good glasses.  No, they're really good.  I took my...  I wear mine out.  The 3D was amazing.  I thought I was gonna get like the dumb motion sickness.  Nothing.  I mean, the shit is floating.  Like you're looking around.  Like you're looking at shit over there like a floating fucking...  If I go to the Black Theater, they'll have glasses for me when I go in.  They won't be clean, but yeah, you'll...  Hopefully, hopefully.  If somebody can pull off some seats.  What did you think about it? 
[02:57:00]  Hopefully not everyone.  You liked it a lot.  I loved it, and I'm not an action movie guy for the most part.  It was a story movie.  There was a lot of story.  The action was amazing.  The machines were amazing.  I liked it a lot.  I didn't even mind the love story with the big blue people.  I wanted to see a little...  A little blue twat.  I think that's gonna be on the DVD or whatever, the extras, them having sex on...  I walked out at that point when they were about to fuck.  Not that I wanted to.  I had to piss, but did they fuck with the tails?  Are there ponytails?  She wrote them. 
[02:57:30]  Did they have to join the ponytails?  I thought, motherfuckers, she wrote them.  There was some docking going on.  Did they dock their ponytails?  With those fucking tails docking.  Is that what happened?  That's how they fought?  There was a lot of docking going on.  And he woke up, they opened up that thing, cumb all in it, all in the machine that he was  locked in.  Yes.  Yeah, they gave him a bukkake while I was still sleeping.  They didn't feel it because his legs are dead, so he just...  They made him roll around with cumbed-up legs.  He just kept cumbing over and over with his blood in it.  And the evil general said, you came on yourself for this blue cunt soldier? 
[02:58:00]  And he's like, hey, man, I love him.  Have you seen Avatar yet on YouTube?  No.  Almost good.  Almost good.  Avatar.  If Danny can pop that up.  Speaking of things you've seen on YouTube, this is probably old as hell.  Also, Reservoir Dogs and the Muppets.  Really?  Did you see Reservoir Dogs and the Muppets?  Yeah, I did.  One of the funniest things I've ever seen, man.  Where they're doing the whole opening waitress scene.  Yes.  Oh, fuck balls. 
[02:58:30]  It's fucking hilarious.  Is it a visual?  Check that out.  It's a visual, yeah.  All right, I'll check it out later.  You've got to watch it.  Avatar.  Almost good.  I think it falls just short.  And it looks like a lot of people want to see it today.  All right, here we go.  It's got to be simple.  Give me five.  I'll do it. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, I'm sleepy.  It's hard.  Sugar Ross.  Oh, this is bad.  This is fun.  Something in, uh...  You grabbed my pants.  I don't understand.  Jake, it's crazy here.  There's no stopping him.  I've got to go to the bathroom. 
[02:59:30]  Horses.  Send us a message that they can take for whatever they want.  Or we will send them a message.  I want ice cream.  Avatar.  Batard.  Oh, you know.  The only reason it isn't better is because they don't have enough scenes with the blue 
[03:00:00]  people talking to each other.  Because they're just using the trailer.  Dude.  Some of these cocksuckers are just good.  That's just fun.  At the beginning, he could have stopped.  Where that one was going.  Oh, shit, man.  I enjoyed that.  God damn it.  God damn you, too.  What other movies?  Yeah, the avatars.  You know what?  And it's going to be the first movie that I'm going to go see twice. 
[03:00:30]  I haven't seen a movie twice in three years.  You're going to see it twice?  Absolutely.  I might have to go see it.  I might have to go 3-D.  I'm going to go 3-D.  I might go today.  How about me and you, Patrice?  No.  I might go 3-D.  Why not?  Not today, though.  I just saw it.  This nigga set you up.  Don't set me up to reject me, bitch.  Jesus Christ.  Not today, Patrice.  You're a fucking asshole.  Don't bug me, nigga.  What's wrong with you?  Here's what he did.  He fucking gave me a pound and then told me, you're lonely.  After the pound.  After the fist.  You went, no. 
[03:01:00]  He went, why?  And you're like, let's go.  Fuck you.  I'm not going today.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I didn't say today.  I didn't say today, either.  No, she did.  You said today.  Oh, yeah.  By myself today.  Yeah, you said by yourself today.  Then he added himself.  You got to go 3-D, Patrice.  I think I'm going to have to do it.  You got to go 3-D.  I think I'm going to have to do it.  You know what?  For real?  I love going to movies with Patrice.  He fucking makes it a movie within a movie.  You fuck.  What else did I see?  I've seen a lot of fucking films.  We saw Tropic Thunder together.  Me, you, and what? 
[03:01:30]  Two other people in an entire theater.  Danny was there.  Danny was there.  I was there, too.  I was there, too.  Stump Brain, and yeah, Bobby was there.  Stump Brain.  And I called an Oscar for that fucker, too.  And fucking Patrice just fucking just talking about the movie as the movie's going on was just  classic.  That was a great film, man.  I liked it.  Tropic Thunder is one of the best comics.  I'm trying to think of what else I saw.  I saw a lot of movies over the weekend.  You didn't see Sherlock Holmes.  I did.  Not yet.  I saw it.  That was good.  Something makes me not feel like seeing it.  It's all right. 
[03:02:00]  It's good.  But Donnie Jr. is good, though, in anything.  He's a great actor.  He's great.  Both of them are.  I've seen Bangkok Dangerous.  Jude Law is not a great actor.  Finally.  What?  Bangkok Dangerous.  That fucking movie sucks.  Nicholas Cage.  I'll tell you what movie's going to be the best.  Nick Cage.  The fucking best movie coming out that is going to bring Nick Cage's career back.  Danny, type in, what is it, ass kiss or something like that?  Ass kiss?  Ass kick?  No, ass kick.  Kick ass.  Kick ass.  Kick ass. 
[03:02:30]  Ass kick?  Kick ass.  And then there's something.  Let me find.  Wait till you see this clip.  This fucking thing is insane.  Yeah, that's it right there.  I don't believe you.  I'll tell you right now.  The trailer or something?  Yeah, see the trailer, but see the girl trailer.  Let me tell you what you want to say.  It ain't happening.  No.  It certainly ain't happening.  Bobby's just fucking too excited about it.  He's building it up and it's going to suck.  No one cares.  It's going to blow.  The movie's going to flop and Bobby's going to be all alone trying to still convince us  it's good.  We're just going to bring him back at this point. 
[03:03:00]  It fucking stinks.  He's over there still trying to find him.  It's going to bring back his fucking career.  He's up helping Danny find it.  All you have to do is, there it is.  All right, we're watching.  It's a comedy fucking about superheroes.  I want to know when Rock is going to make an adult movie.  Oh my God.  Check this shit out.  With that fucking tooth fairy.  What is he, crazy?  Didn't he learn from Vin Diesel?  Holy.  Didn't he learn from Vin Diesel?  With the duck movie?  The duck movie.  Check this out.  Can you talk a little more about what you might want for your birthday?  Can I get a puppy? 
[03:03:30]  You want to get a dog?  Yeah, I'll cut him with a floppy one.  And a breast movie star makeover, Sasha.  I'm just fucking with you, Daddy.  I love a Benchmark Model 42 butterfly knife.  Oh, child.  You always knock me for a loop.  Uh-oh.  All right, stop it.  Watch, watch, watch.  Stop, stop.  So far, this sucks.  Watch.  Just watch the fucking trailer for fucking time.  I saw a big red flag there.  Go, go.  Yes, we're a third of the way through the trailer.  Not one left.  Go, go, go. 
[03:04:00]  No, the worst part.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Lionsgate.  Go.  Yeah, Lionsgate.  Do you understand what Lionsgate does to D-Boy?  D-Boy has to hit it.  Get D-Boy in here.  He's coming.  All right, kid cursing.  Do a love, honey bunny.  It's time to get bad guys.  It's a little kid.  All right?  Okay, you cunts.  Let's see what you can do now. 
[03:04:30]  Wait.  Who are you?  I'm that girl.  You can't have a kid say cunt.  Why?  I don't know. 
[03:05:00]  I just never heard that before.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  Is that real?  Yeah, that's real.  That's from Lionsgate, by the way.  D-Boy.  Why is he in here?  What is it?  Where are you going?  D-Boy hates Lionsgate's movies.  Yeah.  Dude, that comic book is a fucking good comic book.  It's stamped with the mark of failure.  Why?  Why?  Because everything that movie company puts out is shit.  For the most part.  See, he has...  He knows.  Don't even challenge him.  He has a psychopathic aversion to Lionsgate. 
[03:05:30]  Have you ever looked at a movie company and thought, I hate the movie because the movie company is...  Only D-Boy would come up with, I hate every Lionsgate movie.  Anything they do.  Well, I mean, you know, they had some good ones.  Like what?  Well, they did Traffic.  No, Traffic and...  American Psycho.  American Psycho.  That was another one.  That was another one that Jimmy really likes.  What did you say?  Good Luck Chuck?  Someone who won all the Oscars. 
[03:06:00]  I'm being sarcastic.  What is that?  That girl can't be...  I'm boggled that they let a kid speak like that.  It's about...  Even Nick Cage is a superhero, too.  He's like a Batman-type guy.  Yeah.  I love Nick Cage.  All the fucking...  All the kids are superheroes.  But then they don't have superhero power.  Patrice O'Neill is speechless after that trailer.  He's trying to involve...  I don't want to hurt my friend's enthusiasm. 
[03:06:30]  For that horse manure.  You don't think that movie would be funny?  It can eat ass.  That little girl can blow me.  Since she's saying cunt so much.  It can eat dick.  You don't like that movie.  I didn't see the movie.  No one likes that movie.  It'll make $6,800 at the box office.  I'll bet you right now that movie is a fucking blockbuster.  It can't be.  Why not?  Because the little girl said cunt. 
[03:07:00]  Rated-R movies can't be...  They will not allow that to happen.  There's no such thing as a rated-R blockbuster.  You know what?  I bet you that scene is not even in the movie when it comes out.  Really?  Because it's going to hurt the box office.  Yeah.  You think?  Yeah.  It'll be one of those things.  They get rid of it.  Nicolas Cage, they had to pay him $20 mil.  The girl, $4.  $4.  It's the movie will make $40 mil.  Are you out of your mind?  That's it.  A movie can't make $40 mil anymore because of DVD, hotels, all the shit that goes on after 
[03:07:30]  the movie comes out.  Here's what I...  Let me tell you something I hate about movies.  A shit movie will make $100 mil.  Remember when Jaws was important?  It made $100 mil in America.  Worldwide box office is a cop-out and that shows you the failure of films.  I used to only be concerned about what a fucking movie made here.  Now I've got to go worldwide, $462 million pesos.  Worldwide.  Avatar, a billion dollars made worldwide. 
[03:08:00]  Can you please see the highest grossing Lionsgate movie ever?  That's going to be a tough one.  Okay.  That's going to be a tough one.  Bobby.  You don't like it?  He enjoyed...  Let me tell you what Bobby is doing.  Can you wait a minute?  Can you say enthusiasm?  Enthusiasm.  Enthusiasm, he enjoyed watching this concept of a little girl.  That's Matrix shit in there.  Yeah, it just...  Stop it.  No, I like Nick Cage and I like the concept of the movie. 
[03:08:30]  You don't like Nick Cage?  I like Nick Cage.  The comic book is...  What did you like Nick Cage?  The fucking movie you like Nick Cage.  The Rock is one of my favorite movies.  I love The Rock with Sean Connery.  Here's that...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, Bobby.  Can I finish?  Wait, don't just name movies.  Can I finish?  We've seen The Rock.  I like The Rock.  One of my favorite movies.  If you can't cause Nicolas Cage is in it...  I love him in that.  Guess who else could have been in it?  Anybody.  No, I like...  Any movie.  And if you say Con Air, you motherfucker...  I won't.  I won't.  I don't like...  Replace Nicolas Cage with Jerry from up the street. 
[03:09:00]  That doesn't matter.  He doesn't add anything.  I don't...  I don't...  Nick Cage in The Rock is...  I love him in The Rock.  His performance in The Rock.  No, you don't.  Why?  Absolutely.  What do you love about him?  I love that he's a fucking kooky nerd that's a badass in what he does.  No, no, no.  Patrice is right.  You could cast him, anybody else, and the movie would be just this good.  But I like Nick Cage.  I love Nick Cage.  I love Nick Cage.  You really?  I like Nick Cage.  I'm not fucking lying.  Ed Harris is in that movie.  He's trying to be the only guy to like Nirvana before he was famous. 
[03:09:30]  No, I'm not.  That's not what I do, first of all.  That's just fuck you.  That's what you're doing now, motherfucker.  No, no.  I like Nick Cage.  Always have.  Loved him in Wild at Heart.  You don't like him in Wild at Heart?  You don't think he was fucking great in Wild at Heart?  Can I say something about Nick Cage?  Yes, people.  What?  You can take any other actor and put him in a Nick Cage role, like any movie that he's  been in, and that movie will be successful.  He sucks.  He doesn't make any movie better, like decent.  Yeah, it doesn't.  I don't fucking argue.  He's a horrible actor.  I don't argue with a guy with a beard.  I don't fuck with people. 
[03:10:00]  What happened?  All right, Bobby, let me ask you this.  Nick Cage's best movie.  Yeah, Pussy of the Heart.  Wild at Heart was a great movie.  I don't remember the movie.  Wild at Heart?  You don't remember that?  No, I'm being honest.  I don't.  I brought you a snake, get a leather jacket, baby.  You know what this jacket represents to me?  Highest grossing Lionsgate movie was a goddamn documentary.  Fahrenheit 9-11.  And Madea goes to prison.  And all those fucking Madea movies.  He was onto something.  Then a bunch of Saw movies.  They did Saw 2, 3, and 4.  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  Tyler Perry's Madea Family Reunion. 
[03:10:30]  Madea Goes to Jail.  Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married?  That's the one.  And the original Saw.  Lionsgate sucks.  Fahrenheit 9-1-1.  Jeez.  Lionsgate sucks.  And you know what's going to take over number 8 spot?  The Haunting in Connecticut?  Kick-ass.  With the little girl superhero.  Little girl with the hot sauce.  You just said it's going to be successful.  It's called sarcasm.  First of all, Nick Cage in Wild at Heart was a great fucking movie. 
[03:11:00]  What did you go by?  Why don't you say fucking Sean Penn was good in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and go back  that fucking far?  Nick Cage was in Fast Times.  He was great in that.  He was really good in that.  So was it Far as Wind?  Have you ever seen these movies I'm talking about?  Wild at Heart?  No.  Exactly.  But no one here has said yes, Bobby.  You said Wild at Heart 8 times.  What the fuck is it?  Give me a little synopsis.  It's one of those 80s movies that it was one of those fucking things.  I heard him. 
[03:11:30]  I know about that movie.  What is it?  What does he play?  A cop?  No.  He's a fucking guy.  He gets out of jail.  He goes back with his chick.  He fucking...  You know, Robert...  What's his name?  Is it...  Go ahead, Patrice.  Go ahead, Nick.  Go ahead.  Bobby's disgusted with this film.  I just...  I hate Nicolas Cage.  I like him.  Never liked him.  You like Bangkok Dangerous?  No.  Those are awful.  I haven't liked him in a couple years.  But I've liked him...  I like him in a...  Oh, so he...  You know, he likes...  He just doesn't want to see...  Go away. 
[03:12:00]  Is he one of your top actors?  No.  He loves Nicolas Cage.  No, no.  Robert Duvall.  Robert Duvall.  No.  I'm answering a fucking question.  How is that backpedal?  You loved Nicolas Cage.  Am I top actor?  No.  I think there's a lot of people saying...  He said, is he one of your favorite actors?  It has to be after how you were talking about him.  Top five.  Not my top five.  But he's in my top...  Absolutely.  I'm going to tell you, top five actors...  Top ten?  No one will name the actors they're supposed to name.  There are...  Look it, man.  If you don't name Gene Hackman...  You're an asshole.  ...and you don't name Daniel Day-Lewis... 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  ...who makes a movie every 16 years and gets an Oscar...  Yeah.  He's...  But you'll never say he's one of the greatest of all time, but that fucking guy is amazing  and Gene Hackman is...  Gene Hackman's ridiculous.  ...one of the greatest actors I've ever seen.  Gene Hackman's brilliant.  One of the greatest actors I've ever seen, man.  What about Pauly Shore?  He's in the top 360.  360?  Yes.  He's 380 on a top three...  He's a top... 
[03:13:00]  I think I just threw you a loop.  I'm sorry.  For your curveball there.  I think Sylvester Stallone was a fucking great actor.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You don't think Rambo and Rocky, he was great?  Stop it.  You know he wrote Rocky.  Now you're being crazy.  That's crazy.  And he's dead serious?  This is messing up Bobby's legacy.  Now you're being silly.  You don't think he was good in Rambo?  Look, I watched that motherfucker 20 times.  I just watched First Blood.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, doesn't have Rambo in it.  Not the name.  It's just called First Blood.  First Blood, yeah.  A lot of people have mistaken a... 
[03:13:30]  I mean, you guys...  And the second one is Rambo, First Blood 2.  First Blood 2, right, right.  And that's when it started going downhill.  Yeah, yeah.  But Rambo, the original...  The last one was great.  It's a good movie.  His scene at the end?  His scene at the end?  When he has to...  That acting?  That's pretty good fucking acting, dude.  I mean, if you've ever acted in your life, you know how hard it would be to fucking pull  that scene off.  Oh, you see what he's doing on us?  As much as we love it.  I see what you're doing, Bobby.  Bobby's doing that.  No, me to shut up or you're telling Rocky to shut up?  Bobby's in a corner, so now he's like, if you know about acting... 
[03:14:00]  All right, so we don't know about acting, Bobby.  No, about acting.  Here's what kills me.  Somebody just did this.  You know what I fucking did this?  I don't have to fucking know about acting just to feel it.  Just to watch it.  You don't think that fucking sucks you?  No.  You don't think Rambo was a good...  First Blood was a good...  First Blood Part 1 is a fantastic movie.  That's what I'm saying.  But you said Rocky...  Rocky, you don't think Rocky was...  He was great in Rocky.  He was great in Rocky.  You don't think that was fucking great?  James Cameron should be in an argument for greatest director of entertaining movies. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  But should he be in there with the Coen brothers or Scorsese's?  Maybe with Scorsese's.  Because Scorsese's is an entertaining movie guy.  Yeah.  He's not a fantastic, epic guy.  He's not Francis Ford Coppola.  He's that guy.  But James Cameron, Stallone is one of the greatest movie-making guys along with Schwarzenegger.  Can I answer Bobby's question?  He's going to say, he keeps going, was Sylvester Stallone great in Rocky?  Yes, he was.  But the problem we have with Sylvester Stallone is that he was in a bunch of movies where he 
[03:15:00]  sucked.  I'm saying.  And his acting was not good.  Yeah, but he...  But his acting was good in Rocky, right?  So two movies out of what?  30, 40 films.  It wasn't amazing.  Those movies go down.  It was not him.  Exactly.  The movie was amazing.  He was probably playing himself, right?  Watch the Lords of Flatbush.  You feel like saying something.  Watch the Lords of Flatbush and you'll see the same Stallone as you did in Rocky.  D-Boy's looking at Bobby like, I have to have more respect for him because he's on  the show.  Watch Death Race 2000. 
[03:15:30]  But I hate his guts right now.  Machine Gun Joe for Turbo.  Pretty much.  Is Rocky.  Really?  You don't like Sylvester Stallone?  No, I agree with everybody else.  You don't think he's good as an actor.  Bobby, I'm on...  In those movies.  What, Rocky and...  Rocky and Rambo.  He's the same guy in every movie.  He wasn't the same guy in Rocky and Rambo.  Yes, yes.  Pretty similar, Bobby.  Pretty much the same.  Pretty similar.  Understand that I'm going to be on Bobby's side just because he needs somebody on his  side right now.  Thank you very much.  But he's just...  Nobody agrees with him in his fucking...  No.  You're making a fool of yourself.  No, I'm not.  I have an opinion and I'm sticking to him. 
[03:16:00]  Hold on.  He's an icon.  If you think that...  I'll make him a fool.  I will be a fool of Anthony.  You know what?  Let's settle this.  We got Bob Kelly on the phone.  He'll tell us a couple.  Wait a minute.  How does that happen?  You know, dude, I mean, you get in a cage, you get your cigarette, you get your...  Next thing you know, he got in a movie.  Boom.  You got in with him.  I got boom.  You got in with him.  But good job.  I don't like the...  His accent faded out of the...  What about Sylvester Stallone in Copland?  Sylvester Stallone in Copland.  I thought he was good. 
[03:16:30]  No.  I thought he was good.  I don't think so great.  I said good.  I fucking hated Copland.  A lot of people said he was good in Copland.  I thought he was good.  Fuck that.  I'm going to tell you what he did in Copland.  Go ahead, Patrice.  Jesus.  His career was going into Jokeville, right?  Yes.  That motherfucker stole fatness from Robin De Niro.  Because he thought that's what you do.  People mistook fatness for good acting.  You fucking just become a fat, sad man.  What did I miss out on that?  And you get a fucking...  And you get an Oscar.  Yeah. 
[03:17:00]  He tried to trick us.  I didn't like that shit.  But he didn't even get fat.  He was like a little overweight.  He gained 50 pounds.  He gained a lot of weight for that film.  Every movie I saw him and he was jacked.  He tried to do De Niro and it didn't fucking work.  Yeah, he tried to do a raging bull.  But here's what happened to Stallone.  Was new in Rocky.  Right.  It was new in First Blood.  And then became a joke.  It became a joke because Rocky, that character, he was that character. 
[03:17:30]  He was kind of slow.  He was like a childlike kind of beast.  He loved this girl.  It was a love story.  Rocky was a love story.  Right.  Yeah.  But then that became...  And in First Blood, didn't do a lot of talking.  Did a lot of same thing.  Mumbling.  But when he started having more lines, he still mumbled.  So he was like... 
[03:18:00]  But it was like...  The whole movie.  In First Blood, he was like...  They were like, where are you from?  And he's like, what are you doing?  And then they fuck with him and he's like...  And then that last speech was like...  How does this movie go?  And then they what?  And where are you from?  And then what happens when they fuck with him?  And what are you doing?  And then they fuck with him?  And then at the end, you're like...  So the stuff you say that he was good in was beginning him. 
[03:18:30]  Just like, look, Schwarzenegger never became a character...  Schwarzenegger?  Schwarzenegger never became bad because...  Wait a second.  Wait a minute.  What are you saying?  Because he always was a fucking fool.  But his movies were entertaining.  Great movies.  Bad him.  Terminator?  He had two lines, I think.  Something like two or three lines?  Four lines or something? 
[03:19:00]  Fuck you.  Asshole.  Genius.  But Stallone, dude.  Stop.  Don't say he was a good actor.  He was a good actor.  He's an icon.  In those two movies.  He's an icon.  In those two movies.  He's not acting in those two movies.  Get your hand off your gun.  Settle down.  Now he just yells.  What is it?  Turn off the volume.  It's great.  Here's his great acting.  That's not the movie.  That's part two, you asshole.  Fresh blood, part two.  That's part two. 
[03:19:30]  Always the bad guy.  No, this is part one.  No, it's not.  It's part two.  He has a bandana in fucking part two.  One of the greatest lines in movie history.  He's got the microphone.  And the guy goes,  Hey, John, where you at, man?  We're coming to get you.  And he goes, Murdoch.  I'm coming to get you.  Heard up.  This is part two.  This is what I'm talking about.  Yeah, but I'm not talking about this.  I'm talking about one.  This is a terrible fucking...  Colorful names.  They're like the evil Russian guy. 
[03:20:00]  Colorful names.  That's when Russia...  That's when Russia was the villain in every movie.  Every movie.  Now it's Ahmed.  Oh, look at that.  Now it's just bad white guy.  And you notice...  That's what I'm saying.  In an avatar.  At least we had a good evil villain.  And you notice in video games,  the toughest levels are who is our enemy now.  Like...  Yeah, yeah.  Russians are the training level now.  Yeah, but...  They're the training level.  Remember Yakuza used to be the hardest level on games? 
[03:20:30]  Yakuza.  Sure, though.  It's like the Russians.  You know who will always be kick-ass on video games?  Fucking Nazis, man.  I just play Wolfenstein.  Nazis in video games are great.  You play Wolfenstein?  Yeah.  Where they fucking...  The whole game is them trying to find magic?  Yeah, yeah.  They're trying to find...  Like, a cult thing.  And you're just fucking Nazi hunting.  You're just shooting Nazis in the head.  Fucking great.  It's banned in Germany, that game.  Really?  Because it's Nazis.  Because it's probably got a swastik in it. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, but a bunch of...  Can't even show it.  They're Nazis.  I know.  They're Nazis.  It's both of those.  How funny is the...  Boy, the Germans really are like,  Hey, hey, we don't want any of that.  Like, dude, you see what you did with that shit?  Come on.  Stop.  Oh, will you say what you got to say?  Anthony, when they yell in the video games,  the Nazis yell in the video games.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Bang, bang, bang.  I like that.  They scare the shit out of you coming around.  Bang, bang, bang.  I watch it with the subtitle.  You watch it with what?  Me and Patrice have had a thing going for a few minutes here. 
[03:21:30]  The enthusiasm comment really just bummed me out about Bobby, because you're so right.  You don't want to crush his enthusiasm for liking a kid movie in the cage.  I don't even know what to do with that.  That's going to be a good movie.  I guarantee you go and see it.  I guarantee if you go and see it, you'll like it.  You were so excited, and all of us were like,  Let's not get fucking carried away.  This movie's been made a million fucking times.  Was it that exciting?  The action scenes are all the same shit you've seen.  And a girl saying, cunt. 
[03:22:00]  I'm going to tell you why he was excited, Bobby.  A nine-year-old girl.  Bobby goes, because I'm really not excited.  Yes, and I'm going to tell you why.  You really were excited.  He went completely away from everywhere we were going to go.  And went on a limb and said, he got up, helped Danny find it.  He wanted to turn us on to something new.  The cursing girl's cute, I'll give it that.  It's like a novelty thing, it's funny.  I don't know if it's cute more than it's fucking sexual, but go ahead.  But Nicolas Cage has nothing to do with that trailer.  It's the girl running around. 
[03:22:30]  That's a good point, too.  There's another scene with him and the girl where he shoots the girl in the chest.  Why?  To teach her how to take a bullet.  She has a jacket on.  He's like, okay, honey, this is going to hurt, but blah, blah.  And then he just shoots her in the fucking chest.  It sounds like a bomb.  I'll bet you right now it does good.  Bomb.  I'll bet you right now.  Bobby, Bobby, there's a lot of bad movies that do good.  They're going to take the kids to a movie where a girl's saying cunt.  D-Boy.  Who's going to this?  Hold on, D-Boy. 
[03:23:00]  Name a movie this movie.  It wouldn't have been me.  Name a movie that did well, but it's a piece of shit movie.  There's a million of them, Bobby.  It doesn't mean it's a good movie.  Bobby, what's the demo for that movie?  What's the demo for that movie?  This is why it's not going to do well.  Hell fucking no.  Are you making a joke?  No, guys, I'm going to see it.  Guys, I'm not going to see that movie.  If we have a family, we're going to go see that movie.  G.  Right.  If this was The Rock.  If it was Lava Girl and fucking.  She said cunt.  Yeah.  What is that?  No one's going to see it. 
[03:23:30]  Now you can't take your family.  And there's a kid running around as a superhero.  So as an adult, you're like, how am I doing?  You're forgetting the banana splits music in the background.  Na na na.  Na na na na.  Na na na na na.  Na na na na na.  Cunt.  It's Sharkboy and Lava Girl with curses.  Bobby's childlike.  I think I didn't realize that just now.  I really do.  Sylvester Stallone's a good actor.  This movie's great.  I really.  Bobby cries a lot.  Bobby cries a lot. 
[03:24:00]  Jan Michael Vincent.  Fucking great actor.  Shut up.  Wait a minute.  Speaking of guys that were, that are bad now and wasn't.  Yeah.  Fell off the face of the earth.  Fucking Eric Roberts.  Oh, shit.  Wait, he was back recently?  No, but he was in Dark Knight.  He was in Dark Knight, but he sucked in that.  Motherfucker.  I saw Star 80, dude.  Star 80.  That was sick, yeah.  He was genius.  Runaway Train.  You see him in Runaway Train? 
[03:24:30]  He was genius.  I remember Runaway Train.  The public for Greenwich Village.  He was the Charlie, they took my thumb guy.  Motherfucker sick.  He couldn't overcome the fucking sister thing.  He got ready to kill us.  He goes, you're doing me a big fever.  She's like, she's going to give him some pussy.  And she's just like, here.  And he's just like, you're going to do me.  I think he fucked himself up in Hollywood because of his sister.  Like, they had him.  Nah, man.  He had an incident.  He was good. 
[03:25:00]  He was Oscar good.  He's Oscar good, man.  But then she came out of nowhere and everybody loved that fucking bitch.  But she stinks.  Dude, you didn't think he was getting Batman?  People loved her.  He wasn't, he wasn't not, but he wasn't a, it wasn't, I think he could have played, um.  That was an easy role for him though, right?  And Tom Berenger.  Like, what happened to Tom Berenger?  Fucking fucking.  Barnes and Platoon is the, is, is in the top five greatest movie characters ever.  He's good.  Abso-fucking-lutely right there.  Ever.  And he just, gone. 
[03:25:30]  Not as good as Sylvester Stallone though.  No, not.  You're right.  Oh, you're being sexy.  Top movie characters ever.  Bobby, that's a, that's a rough one with Stallone.  For real.  Yeah, we, yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, Eric Roberts.  You seen Star 80?  Yes.  Not in a long time.  Not in a long time.  It's one of those not in a long time movies for me.  Well, even, what's his name?  What was the guy that was in Runaway Train with, uh.  John Voight.  John Voight.  But he had a renaissance though.  He's now good again.  Yeah, but he's good, but he, he's, he's doing those fucking cheesy movies.  See Enemy of the State?  He was great in that fucking film. 
[03:26:00]  Right.  Mm, yeah.  Back in the day though, he was like a character actor.  John Voight.  Fucking Voight was the shit.  Oh, Midnight Cowboy.  In Runaway Train, he was a fucking evil, badass, badass motherfucker.  You see that movie?  He's a badass motherfucker in that movie.  He had that fucking weird accent that you don't know where the fuck it's from.  It's like half Russian, half fucking Southern.  John Voight fell off the map, but I think they just get tired of you.  But they don't get tired of, um, uh, Kevin Costner though.  Like they allow him just to.  Oh, he's done too.  What has he done?  Pump out another movie.  But they let him stay in movies.  After Waterworld, I need to do his pump out. 
[03:26:30]  After Waterworld.  I like Waterworld though.  I did too.  Oh, really?  And I like the Postman.  I like the Postman.  You like the Postman?  It's the same movie.  I enjoyed the Postman.  It's the same movie.  One's on land and one's in the water.  Tennis hoppers in both of them.  It's great.  It's the same fucking movie.  Oh, Patrice.  One is horses and one's jet skis, you fucking asshole.  Patrice was going strong, but you just lost some Craig, man.  And they're both.  And they're both the fucking road warrior.  I enjoyed the one. 
[03:27:00]  Did you like Waterworld?  Yes.  You didn't like Waterworld?  Fuck you.  I'm going to be on Patrice's side just because his enthusiasm.  Yeah, Patrice, you lost a little bit right there.  A little bit.  I'm not saying it was good.  I'm saying.  I'm going back now.  I'm punching back.  I didn't hate Waterworld like the whole world hated Waterworld.  Everyone hated it like it was a piece of shit.  I will watch that and I will watch the Postman.  I fucking think that movie is great.  I've seen Waterworld 40 times at least.  I know.  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  Just to watch it.  I've seen it 40 times, but I've never seen it fully once.  I've never sat through the whole fucking movie.  I've always missed a piece of beginning, the end.  That guy they pull up with.  What happens at the end of the movie?  Is that the movie?  They find land.  He's selling pussy for paper.  45 minutes with the wee one.  Pussy for paper.  They used to fucking do that back.  Hawaiians used to fucking get nails for pussy.  Paper.  45 minutes with the wee one. 
[03:28:00]  Fucking maniac.  Can you believe he wanted some young girl pussy?  He wanted some fucking young girl.  I got the paper.  Paper.  And then that bitch who fell off the map, but she's back on HBO now.  Yeah, she was hot.  Yeah, but she's always been on the map.  What's her name?  What's her name, man?  I know who you're talking about.  She was in Pollock, too, right?  When she drops them.  She had weird lips and shit.  Yeah, yeah.  She got them weird fucking lips.  What's that girl?  What's that lady's name?  She played the wife and everything for like a second.  But she was in...  Fuck, I don't know.  The Firm.  What a world. 
[03:28:30]  She was in Pollock.  She was in fucking the one with Sharon Stone.  The fucking...  All right.  She was...  She was a killer.  Someone...  What is that fucking girl?  She's helping me out.  Someone put it up here.  Somebody's got it.  Come on.  Someone put it up there.  What's her name?  All right.  Eric Roberts got it.  Gene Triplehorn.  That's not her.  Is that her?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Hold on.  We got some info on Eric Roberts.  Because, yeah, that's a strange one that came up today.  Rich in Ohio.  Rich.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, Eric Roberts had a massive car accident happen right at the height of his success. 
[03:29:00]  But I think it was about the same time Mark Hamill had his big wreck, too.  Because it was like a back-to-back thing in Hollywood.  But what kind of injuries did he have that he went away for so long?  That's why his nose fell crooked.  Oh.  Fucked up his face.  So, like a Mickey Rourke kind of situation.  That's why he's sporting the Owen Wilson nose.  You see Mickey Rourke in the Iron Man 2 trailer?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Mickey Rourke, he's a fucking good actor.  He was his face fucked up.  What was that movie?  It was a bounty hunter? 
[03:29:30]  He was good in fucking that other, the cartoon movie there.  Mickey Rourke.  Year of the Dragon.  Mickey Rourke was on.  He's always good.  All right.  But that fucking dude, look, I'm not saying, I'm just saying there's some bad movies  that we've all seen alive.  Dude, I'll watch any movie.  I'll watch a Jan Michael Vincent movie twice in the same day.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm retarded.  I'll watch any kind of shit.  I've seen Jaws 3 75 times.  I've watched it every time it's on.  Every time it's on.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous with the tunnel and the fucking... 
[03:30:00]  I watched...  Remember Rob Lowe was like Brad Pitt famous and that good looking?  What's the hockey one?  What's the hockey movie?  I watched it last night.  The hockey movie he was in.  With Rob Lowe?  Yeah, Rob Lowe.  That was a fuck.  I watched it from beginning to end.  You've seen Jaws 3 a bunch of times?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Best Grey's line.  Youngblood.  Youngblood.  The guy goes, the girl goes, the bites, she goes, the fish was in the park. 
[03:30:30]  He was attacked in the park.  The mother is in the park.  And then Lou Gossett Jr. goes, the damn fish mother?  You said the damn fish mother is in the park?  Can we get that clip possibly?  I don't know if we can find that much.  You said the damn fish mother is in the park?  That's the chick from Waterworld. 
[03:31:00]  What did you think of the new Star Trek?  Man, I saw it without sound.  I haven't seen it.  Are you kidding me?  I've seen it on a plane without sound.  I didn't even put the earphones on.  It was amazing just to look at.  That is one of my new favorite movies.  That fucking movie was unbelievable.  I've watched that probably ten times already.  I've watched it all.  And I'm not even shitting you.  Since it's even come out on DVD, I've watched it ten fucking times.  It's a great movie.  And I could still watch it tomorrow. 
[03:31:30]  Dude, I didn't see sound.  It was unbelievable.  You didn't see that movie?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I was one of those guys, and we had him in here, the director.  What's his name?  Fucking Abrams.  Abrams, thank you.  J.J. Abrams?  And he even said, you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy my movie.  But Dan said the same thing.  Yeah, I've got to go see it.  That's the guy that did Cloverfield, J.J. Abrams.  Yeah, but he does Lost, too.  He does Lost, too.  And he does the other one, too.  He knows what he's doing, man.  Damn.  Yeah, dude.  And Cloverfield could have been good. 
[03:32:00]  Let's be honest with you.  I'd say the best part of Cloverfield is when they did the night vision in the tunnel,  and the fucking creatures were behind him.  They had no lights, and then he had the camera, and then he flicked the night vision on it.  Dude, there were some great scenes, even though the movie fell short.  I hate a movie that I want to love bad.  I wanted to love Cloverfield really.  Yeah, I want to like that.  That happened with fucking Planet of the Apes.  I was all about Planet of the Apes.  Is that the number one all-time fuck-up?  Is the Mark Wahlberg on Planet of the Apes, man?  We all were excited. 
[03:32:30]  All right, we're going to get some fucking movies now for the next 10 years.  It's unbelievable, man.  We got the technology where they can fucking make them look really good and everything,  and then they just fuck the story.  One of my top 15 movies.  That movie was un...  Shut it.  I'm kidding.  So bad, they're not even thinking of making another one.  They're not even thinking about it.  Your hand was on your gun.  And they knew they had 10 movies, you know?  If that first movie did well, they knew they had another 10 they could make.  Dude, I...  A disaster.  You can't get more disappointed.  Yeah, they fucked that up.  In a movie, didn't that Planet of the Apes thing. 
[03:33:00]  I couldn't believe it, man.  I was shaking my head.  I saw it the other day.  It's on right now?  Yeah.  And you just...  I watched it again, and I go, this movie's bad.  It's horrible.  You know what?  What?  Vin Diesel fell before me, too, man.  I was just going to mention...  Pitch Black is a fucking great movie.  Pitch Black.  Watched it last night.  That was good.  Here's the issue with remakes and guys that get their hands on remakes.  This is why Star Trek did well.  A lot...  Somebody has the rights to the Warriors. 
[03:33:30]  I was reading about this.  And he's...  He says it.  He goes, I'm not...  I'm moving it to L.A.  That it's going to take place in Los Angeles.  It's going to...  It's going to...  We're going to take all these people that's dressed up and we're going to do...  And I go, that's the issue.  The issue is Planet of the Apes remake should have been exactly the same fucking movie with  new shit.  Yeah.  That's what we want to see.  That's what we want to see.  We want to see what the ship would have looked like if it crashed and the other things.  We want to see the... 
[03:34:00]  We even want to see a black actor...  Dr. Zass.  ...fucking get shot and they fucking give him a lobotomy and the other guy gets his throat  cut.  Yeah.  And we want to see Mark Wahlberg go, get your fucking...  They switched the line to go, get your hands off me, you filthy human.  What are you, a dick?  Stop it.  I'm going to bring the whole show around with that.  Make it taste like lasagna.  Make it taste like lasagna.  For real.  Keep it tasting like lasagna. 
[03:34:30]  If you're going to make lasagna, make it fucking taste like lasagna.  Simple as that.  It was so...  Simple as fucking that.  He didn't even...  Mark Wahlberg in that movie.  Make the fucking Statue of Liberty in the fucking...  You know...  He wasn't even surprised to be there.  No.  He was like there and he never was like...  He didn't go through the pain of being a dumb human.  The throat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That whole thing where it's like, fuck, I'm...  I got to...  The humans talked.  The girl in it was like, hey man, what's going on?  Yeah.  Like what?  Dude, you never felt... 
[03:35:00]  How come the humans are talking?  Yeah, you never felt for the...  Like the original Planet of the Apes when they touched down.  You're like, they're fucking stuck on this sick fucking planet.  You felt for those guys.  Like, holy shit, they're never getting off this planet.  I fucking...  I've seen it four times and I hate it.  I hate it.  Well, that means you try to like it.  No.  One and done for me, man.  I watch it because hatred motivates me sometimes.  I know.  Yeah, I hear that.  Like I watch a lot of things just because I hate it and I go, boy, this sucks.  Just to go like, oh, fuck this. 
[03:35:30]  This sucks.  That might be the most disappointing and worst.  That's strong.  Because I was so excited, man.  You all grew up with Planet of the Apes.  I had the movie poster over my desk at N.E.W.  Great, one of the great all-time movies at the end, at the all-time.  And then at the end, I watch it and I keep looking at the end of that movie going, what  does this mean?  Yeah, what happened?  But even the Planet of the Apes series fell off.  Did you ever see the... 
[03:36:00]  I forgot what it was.  The series was bad.  Making of...  No, but as the movies went on, they didn't have as big of a budget and then the monkeys  had just like Halloween masks on in the background and stuff.  Yeah, they look really bad.  And if you look closely, you're like, oh, shit.  The making of the movie...  They just had the front of the mask.  No, for real.  With an elastic.  Like the first one, they really...  Huh?  The guy that goes, nah, see, he was supposed to be Dr. Zayas in the movie.  Oh, right, right.  Edward G. Robinson.  And the way they made the movies, they put the makeup on him because everybody thought  this was going to be ridiculous.  And they put the makeup on him and had him do a serious scene. 
[03:36:30]  And it was like, wow, this is not fucking so bad.  And that movie, the details and the love of that movie...  Because, lookit, I'm a big Clash of the Titans fan.  Yeah.  It's coming out with a remake now.  A fucking remake.  And I'm really nervous.  Because I like stop motion animation.  The Clash of the Titans is so cool.  It's a great movie.  You know what?  The original Planet of the Apes still holds up.  Clash of the Titans in Dinerama.  You're looking at the costumes and the makeup and you're like, holy shit, it still fucking 
[03:37:00]  holds up.  The heart.  It holds up.  Man, lookit.  They did four movies.  None of them were bad.  The Conquest of the Planet of the Apes was a fucking...  I like them all.  It's a great movie.  They all were great.  And they could have remade all of them if they didn't fuck up.  Fuck!  Yeah, I see that.  But why was it so bad?  Because that idiot fucking...  Because some pompous asshole thought he could reinvent the thing.  It's fucking...  They were able to reinvent the Batman series.  I remember...  We've got to give it to them for that.  They made it darker.  Yeah.  Fucking great. 
[03:37:30]  And so they were thinking, all right, I'm just going to reinvent this fucking Planet of  the Apes.  You didn't have to.  Yeah, Batman sucked.  If you watch the Batman movies now, you see the ice is shaking because it's plastic when  they go behind them.  How do you fucking like this?  You think the Jack Nicholson holds up?  The Jack Nicholson holds up, but Heath Ledger fucking...  I don't even think of that shit anymore.  He killed the series, I think.  Yeah, he was fucking the shit.  How do you make another one after Heath Ledger?  He just redefined...  The Joker.  He popped up into the top five movie villains of all time, I would say. 
[03:38:00]  Fuck it.  Popped right up in there.  Easy.  I think it was...  He's not number one.  He didn't take over Hannibal Lecter.  I don't think he took over Clubber Lang from Rocky III.  You like the guy from No Country for Old Men?  Chigar?  That was a good fucking villain.  Great to watch, but not in the top five villains of all time.  I think Barnes is in the top five.  Yeah, Barnes is great.  I think the Joker's in the top five, and I think, um...  That's Jim.  Yeah.  Wow, that's tough.  I would say Hannibal Lecter, Barnes, Sergeant Barnes... 
[03:38:30]  But he wasn't a bad guy.  He wasn't a villain.  Sergeant Barnes.  Sergeant Barnes.  Hannibal Lecter wasn't a villain.  He was actually a good guy.  The villain was Buffalo Bill.  Really?  He ate...  He ate his faces?  Yeah, but he was...  He hung the guy on the fucking thing.  But you didn't like that guy.  He was an asshole.  You didn't like either one of them.  I see what you're saying.  I see what you're saying.  You liked Hannibal Lecter.  He was the guy from fucking Rambo.  Yeah, but he wasn't...  He was.  No, he always plays a douche, right? 
[03:39:00]  The cop, yeah, that he fucking...  No, the cop was...  Hung up and splayed out, wasn't he?  No, that was on number two.  On number two, yeah.  Yeah, no.  Hannibal Lecter wasn't a villain, dude.  I would say Hannibal Lecter's got a...  He's a villain.  He's a villain.  He's not a villain.  He's a fucking...  All right.  You'll like him.  We have come to the end of this show.  Oh, damn.  I was trying to think of better...  Good villains.  Joker's in the top five.  We can still do the villain thing.  I'm just...  I'm just trying to think of a fucking...  And should have one.  What's the last...  The last...  Fucking...  I don't know if this fits in,  but it just popped in my head. 
[03:39:30]  Motherfucking Mr. White from Reservoir Dogs.  What a scum.  Yeah, he's back.  Michael Madsen?  Michael Madsen was pretty fucking bad, man.  He was pretty fucking bad.  Come on.  With that cop in the chair?  No, he was...  I'm thinking of top five.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a great villain.  It's just like Chigar.  Chigar, he's a great villain,  but you can't put him...  Yeah, top five.  Top five worse.  I mean, motherfuckers you hate,  I was...  The warden from Shawshank Redemption, 
[03:40:00]  just a piece of shit.  What about the guy from The Green Mile?  Salvation Lies Within.  The guy from The Green Mile.  That motherfucker.  Fucking Percy.  Who played that?  Sam Rockwell.  No, Sam Rockwell was a prisoner.  No, Sam Rockwell was a crazy prisoner guy.  Percy was the guy that was like...  Yeah, he wanted the...  Francois Delacroix.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  You lost sevens to death.  I know you're talking about that guy.  And he plays a douche.  He's another one that plays a douche.  Yeah.  Just like Michael Rooker always plays a racist. 
[03:40:30]  Greatest racist in movie history.  Michael Rooker,  the guy that played the...  He was in Mississippi Burning.  He always played...  Oh, racist guy.  A raging,  frothing at the mouth,  country racist.  All right, they're coming in now.  De Niro and Cape Fear.  No, not a top five.  Not a top five.  Really?  You don't think fucking De Niro is a hit?  He was great,  but not a...  Just not a top five.  Darth Vader,  the obvious?  Nah.  Coming in?  No?  Nope.  Nah, that's silly. 
[03:41:00]  I know why people say it,  but it's an all-time...  But no.  You need someone ruthless.  I mean, really...  It's ruthless.  Yeah, really bad.  Fucking ruthless.  Really, really bad.  I mean,  really good and bad.  I mean,  the Joker was brutal.  And if it was a rated R movie,  he would have been...  Patricia,  you might have to move  Heath Ledger up.  He's top five right now,  but you might have to move him up.  He might be three.  He might be...  Because he's not going to go...  He's not going to be hired in Barnes.  We haven't even picked fucking five yet.  Barnes is good.  I know.  That's why you moved...  I'm telling you,  Mr. T is Clubber Lane, man.  That kept him... 
[03:41:30]  I think that he's one of the  all-time great movie villains  is Clubber Lane.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  You want a real man?  He just was...  Come on, my place.  I'll show you a real man.  That made every fucking white guy go,  motherfucker.  Oh, motherfucker.  He's going to fuck a...  What?  Clubber Lane was genius.  Oh, you just pictured him  on fucking Adrian.  Fuck it.  Just big Mr. Teacock.  Got one from Tommy in Brooklyn.  Tricking some fucking  Colt 45 while he's fucking her.  Got one from Tommy from Brooklyn. 
[03:42:00]  I'm going to give you  a little question here.  Female.  Oh, right.  Someone to think about.  Female villain  Tommy came up with  in Brooklyn.  Did he have one?  That was an all-timer?  Could be an all-timer.  You got to think out of the box  a little bit, slightly.  Uh, female.  Kathy Bates in Misery.  Oh, shit.  That's a good one.  What a fucking...  There you go, Ed.  Huge.  There you go.  Bad.  Shit.  She might be in the top ten.  Hobble.  Top five. 
[03:42:30]  Fucking hobble.  Ah, top five.  Dude, she...  Name one more.  Dude, she hobbled  the motherfucking toy.  Fucking said,  no, you're staying.  Oh, shit.  And then...  That's a...  That might be...  But didn't she...  Yeah, hold on.  She did something else, too.  Let me tell you, though.  Tommy Brooklyn came up  with Nurse Ratched.  On Nurse Ratched?  She was a cunt.  She's a cunt.  Yes.  She's a cunt.  Top cunt of all time.  She was a cunt.  She wasn't villainous.  She was just  what they people are.  She wasn't...  All right.  Internally evil. 
[03:43:00]  It wasn't like...  Yeah, you need like  evilness and ruthless.  It wasn't evil.  It's ruthlessness.  Kathy Bates evil.  Evil, yeah.  Dude.  Yeah, no remorse.  Just evilness.  And she was void  of evil.  She was void of it, though.  Glenn Close  in fucking...  What's that movie?  No.  No.  No.  That fucking crazy bitch?  Psycho bitches don't get top.  No.  She's a psycho bitch?  She was a psycho.  Wait a minute.  There's cunt,  psycho bitch,  and then evil villain. 
[03:43:30]  Evil villain Kathy Bates  was scary.  You have to break it up  with women.  You have to break it up  with guys.  We did.  That's why we didn't  get Darth Raider.  You can't give a...  Who's the top cunt guy?  Well, we said Darth Vader  because he fucking...  He's not a cunt.  He's cartoony.  Blowing up planets.  He's not a cunt.  He was cartoony.  He blew up a planet.  He wasn't like...  He wasn't like,  oh, wow,  this guy scares me to death.  Darth Vader's just  aggravating.  I feel like I'm  missing something.  I'm about to go home.  I know.  I really do feel like I'm...  You know what,  Patrice, you're back tomorrow. 
[03:44:00]  I mean, Bob,  you come back tomorrow, too.  All right, everyone's down.  We're hanging work  if you want.  It's up to you.  Find your...  We'll continue the discussion.  I do want to tell everybody  that Bob Kelly and Patrice  are doing a show together.  I did not know this  until today.  Ebony and Ivory.  This is pretty fucking cool.  What an asshole.  They're calling it...  Who came up with the name  Comedy on the Edge?  What's it called?  Not us.  Not us.  I didn't think so.  Some guy who don't know.  You don't need...  You don't need to name what it is. 
[03:44:30]  Comedy on the Edge  with Bob Kelly and Patrice O'Neill.  You don't have to do that.  The crazy stylings.  Oh, right.  Somebody that don't know.  We should just go there  and be crystal clean  and do really nice TV humor.  Dude, I'm going to do it.  I'm going to go there  and not even swear.  Where's the fucking  wild, crazy humor shit?  Can I say, though,  because these guys...  I want to do this for them here.  Bob Kelly and Patrice together,  that's a really solid  fucking show right there.  Anybody else playing with you guys?  A little warm-up guy or something? 
[03:45:00]  I'm going to see this.  All right.  But you got Robert Kelly  and Patrice O'Neill.  I saw Robert Kelly recently  warming up for Dane Cook  at the Garden.  Fucking had the place  in stitches, man.  For real.  Bobby's closing the show, too,  by the way,  because Bobby's a big theater guy now.  Fuck you.  He's moved along,  so he's...  I ain't closing shit.  Why are you always going to...  You are the...  Listen, funny man.  You are the closer.  You fucking...  You have more credits.  You're bigger.  You're probably fucking...  I'm not fucking as powerful  in front of a lot of people  as Bobby does.  Fuck you. 
[03:45:30]  You're one of the funny...  You're probably the fucking  top three funniest guys  on the planet.  I think you're one  of my favorite comics.  Patrice's confidence  bugs me.  Patrice...  No.  He walks out there,  casually sits on that stool.  All right.  Are you guys ready?  Patrice's time.  Patrice is trying to get...  Patrice wants to be  the only headliner  that goes up in the middle.  He wants to do an hour  in the middle  and have somebody  go up after him.  Hey, you get two quality guys  going on,  doing their little things.  I think Bobby  is a real headliner.  No, you're headlining  due to your paycheck. 
[03:46:00]  I like when Patrice  comes out,  sits down,  and doesn't even  start to talk.  Like most comics  get right on the mic.  Hey, how we doing?  Patrice will sit down  and look at the crowd  like, all right,  what have I got  to deal with tonight?  Like, what asshole  is my fucking deal?  Looks around,  going confident and shit.  It ain't confident.  He doesn't even have to...  Stop looking going.  He doesn't even have to...  I got to do it.  I got to do 59 more minutes.  He doesn't even...  Look at this fucking bitch  in the front.  I ain't got guts already.  He knows he doesn't  even have to stand. 
[03:46:30]  Patrice will walk...  He'll walk half the crowd  and then go,  good, let's start.  What?  Yeah.  All right, listen.  I'm ready.  Let me get it out there  because this seriously  is a good show.  I'm going to go to this one.  Oh, God.  See, now I got to say  that I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Ray Fiennes in Schindler's List.  Wow.  I'd poth in you.  Wow.  I'd poth...  He was just shitting  and shooting people  out the window.  He'd wake up in the morning  and go,  shoot a couple of Jews.  But does that count  since Nazis  are already 
[03:47:00]  the most fucked up  people to have  above and beyond  bad fucking Nazis?  Like, there were Nazis  looking at him like,  wow, God damn.  Even some of the  German Shepherds  are like,  dude, this guy's fucking nuts.  Anybody who plays Hitler  would be one of the  worst villains  in a movie.  But Ray Fiennes  was fucking...  Ralph or Ray?  Ralph Fiennes.  It's like Ralph Rafe.  Ray, Rafe.  I just say Ray Fiennes.  We gotta get...  We gotta have one more  great movie villain  before we get out of here.  Alright, alright.  I got another cunt.  Oh. 
[03:47:30]  Homeless Jim on Twitter  writes,  top five villain  is the witch  from Wizard of Oz.  Some poor schmuck  was married to that  and had to fuck it.  Someone else is being  as smart as  and saying  top five villains  Abraham Lincoln.  Ah, shit.  Oh, he's fucking racist.  Yeah, that's hard.  He's a piece of shit.  This is bad.  I'm gonna try  to get your plug out  because this really  is a good show.  I'm gonna go.  I think we all 
[03:48:00]  should meet at this show  and have a nice  party weekend.  Let's go.  It's Bob Kelly and Patrice.  Ignore that stupid  comedy of the edge shit.  It's Saturday,  March 6th.  Xanadu...  Xanadu at Trump Taj Mahal  in Atlantic City.  So, come on.  So, save a dollar.  It's $25.50 to get in.  Save a dollar a day.  Yep.  We don't want to get in there.  I know it's times are tough.  Dude, fucking book a room  in advance  and let's have a party.  Bob Kelly,  Patrice O'Neal,  Xanadu,  Trump Taj Mahal... 
[03:48:30]  Don't say it if you don't mean it.  Why don't you come through?  Anthony will be there  but he won't be coming  to see us perform.  Let's see your best.  I'm like,  don't fucking miss the show.  I'm still at the blackjack table.  Patrice, I will be there.  Bobby, I will be there.  This is a good show.  March 6th,  Saturday.  Tickets $25.50  on sale now  through Ticketmaster.com  or 1-800-736-1420.  Yeah.  It's a perfect place  for the Philly  and the New York crowd to meet.  Come on through.  Perfect.  All right?  All right, man.  Thank you very much.  Patrice will be back tomorrow.  Gallagher will be here.  Maybe Bobby. 
[03:49:00]  We'll see.  Is Gallagher coming in?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I don't even...  I mean,  I might come in  and just lie on the couch  and listen.  Yeah, we're not talking about Gallagher.  Exactly.  Huh?  Really?  We're not talking about Gallagher.  Let's do it tomorrow.  It's fucking crazy.  He's crazy, but he's fucking...  No, I heard you guys talking about him.  I heard you guys...  We love him.  Yeah, he's crazy.  I heard it was great.  Yeah, I don't know  what to make of him, though.  We love watching him.  He's a lunatic.  Wasn't he on the phone with us one time?  He's insane, right?  Like, I'm not sitting there  as he's going off.  I'm not sitting here  laughing my balls off or anything.  Occasionally, I'll chuckle,  but I'm just looking at him like, 
[03:49:30]  what the fuck is this lunatic talking about?  And does he still have that  Hulk Hogan hair?  Yeah.  Like, he's just...  Yeah.  But he gave up on the hat.  So he's just walking around  and shit.  Now it's more like fucking...  You're going to love him tomorrow.  Larry from The Three Suits.  Crypt Keeper?  Yeah.  You're going to love him tomorrow.  It's frizzed up a bit.  I want to follow him around for one day.  I want to know what he does  after he's done with the radio shit.  He might be able to resurrect.  Get a pocket full of change.  I bet he's outside with a cuff somewhere.  He bragged that he took a subway 
[03:50:00]  or a train from JFK with his mallet.  He got his mallet with him.  He's got dirty hands.  He stays in shitty motels and hotels.  He don't care.  There he is.  But he did.  He said some shit that made sense, man.  And he makes sense.  Some shit pops out of his mouth.  You're like, what the fuck did he just say?  Patrice, you don't have to say it all.  Patrice, you don't have to say it all.  We just depressed Patrice again.  You don't have to say it all.  Patrice came in kind of feeling all...  You don't have to say it all.  The guy's still right there.  Had a great time.  And then right at the end, it's...  Sharp.  You sharp?  Still sharp now?  Big time. 
[03:50:30]  And full of energy.  And he only has 80% of his heart working.  Yeah, but his fucking...  The way he talks, it's hypnotic.  You just wind up staring like, what the fuck is he?  Yeah, because you're like...  I'm telling you, he's talked about...  People know him for his horse shit watermelons and all of that shit, but that motherfucker  used to talk about world issues back then.  A lot deeper than that watermelon shit.  But his name, Gallagher, it's like being called, you know, come on to the stage, Fruity Pebble  with his fucking magic wands.  And then he's like, hey man, you know, life used to be fucking... 
[03:51:00]  And you go, this guy's great, but he's just...  He's talking some real shit.  Why is he mashing watermelons in front of my face?  It was a punchline for Ant and I over the years, too.  When someone would call in and make Ant do a voice or something, I'm like, yeah, it's  you know, squash the watermelons.  Squash the watermelon.  Squash the watermelon.  Go ahead.  I was like, yeah, thanks.  No, I won't be doing that.  Yeah.  You really don't...  You really don't want to do what you're told to do.  It's like, you go...  Yeah, really.  Do that thing, boy.  Tomorrow, he won't be smashing anything, and he'll be great. 
[03:51:30]  He'll be great.  So the plastic was up in here.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Everywhere.  I got a video.  Did he smash it like, oh, I got it by.  Nah, he was in...  He did it like he was doing it for the first time.  He did it with love.  God fucking bless him.  He did it with love.  He did.  Absolutely.  And he knew everything.  When he smashed it, he goes, this one ain't gonna go good.  Bam.  He goes, now this is a good one.  Bam.  Like, he knew the shit that really flies out and stuff that just kind of crumbles up the table.  Yeah, he got mad at some of the stuff we bought.  Yeah, because over the years, he just knows what smashes and what doesn't.  And then he goes, if you break it in half, it'll smash good for you. 
[03:52:00]  I got a video.  That's fucking genius, man.  I got a video on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, from yesterday.  The physics behind it.  Him smashing shit, if you want to check it out.  And the last thing I've got to say about World today, what happened to, goddamn, the great...  Are you renting the studio?  The guitarist?  The bum guitarist?  Oh, yeah.  He's getting plenty of...  We haven't given up on him.  He's getting plenty of play.  The video is up to 600,000 views.  Word of mouth.  It's huge, right?  Dude, it didn't even hit any websites.  It's just word of mouth, for the most part.  Yeah.  And Alt Nation here at SiriusXM is playing the version of Creep and getting a nice response. 
[03:52:30]  Really?  It's still growing.  And he's somewhere just fucking flinging his own shit in the air somewhere.  He's somewhere cold right now.  Janine's pointing out the fact that you just said, the bum guitarist.  I just read it, it's like, the bum guitarist.  That's it.  That's it.  That is fantastic.  But dude, that thing is still fucking happening.  Did you see that?  The guy, the homeless guy?  Doing Creep?  Yeah.  It was actually pretty good, man.  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  Pretty good.  Opie's Eye is getting a lot of hits.  Sometimes I'll get on there.  Some will be like three, and then some will be like 800 million.  You never know what sticks.  It's the weirdest thing.  People are going to start going, hey, dude, can I get on the fucking OPI?  Can I do an episode?  Hit or miss.  Hit or miss.  OPI.  OPI.  Yeah, me and Anne want to, I want to shoot guns with Anne for OPI's Eye.  Yeah, that'd be a good one.  When the fuck are we doing that?  We got to wait until the fucking warm weather because the indoor range doesn't like videotaping  stuff.  I got yelled at.  I don't want to leave yet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Dude, you got a whole show tomorrow with us. 
[03:53:30]  I'm lonely all around.  And the SiriusXM.  Oh, man, that Patrice.  I'm like, yeah, well.  How come they don't call me?  What's going on?  Because they don't have any money or something.  It's bullshit.  I'll just, I'll just.  They're like, oh, we got to do so with Patrice.  I'm like, really?  Yeah, but they should say.  I've been telling Patrice that for five years.  It was like, shit.  Get some money together and Patrice will fucking do a show for you.  And kick ass.  I'd rather come in for free when I'm fucking.  When I'm ass to it.  I'm embarrassed to tell you what they say at this point because it's all empty promises 
[03:54:00]  for the last five years.  I get my own commercials.  Empty fucking promises.  I make that deal I heard they do with people.  They make them get their own sponsors.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like infomercials.  No, you're better.  What?  Way better than that.  Fucking get a own.  Yeah, it's like, you know.  Let other hacks do that.  You're way better than that.  Condoms, hookers.  You pay for, you pay them.  I could do this.  And then they come in and you celebrate.  I could do this.  Let's sell some tickets.  Bob Kelly and Patrice.  March 6th.  Xanadu.  Trump Taj Mahal.  Taj Mahal.  Jesus.  Where'd you get that jacket?  The fucking future.  Down there through Ticketmaster.com.  We'll see you tomorrow, Patrice. 
[03:54:30]  Hey, thanks a lot.  And remember, Bobby's headlining that gig.  I'm not headlining.  Patrice, I'm not going to disappoint a bunch.  They want to come and see you.  But just in case you're not back, Gotham Comedy Club all weekend starting tonight.  Tonight?  Yep, all the way through Sunday.  Gotham, New York City.  You're at Gotham.  I'm sorry about that.  We should have got more of those plugs out.  Headlining at Gotham.  Like, he will be at the Taj Mahal.  You're all fucking headlining, dude.  There's no way.  We're just babbling.  Just hit the break.  We're just babbling.  We're just babbling. </pre>
