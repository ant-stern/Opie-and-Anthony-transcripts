<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in their signature brand of vulgar humor, joking about flatulence and the show's own crudity.  They then transitioned to a discussion of pop culture, specifically gossipy comments overheard about Kelly Clarkson's pregnancy and speculation about Eminem and Kim's potential reconciliation.  This quickly devolved into sexually explicit conversations about female anatomy.  A significant portion of the early show was dedicated to venting frustration with Time Warner Cable's poor service and outdated equipment, contrasting it favorably with their positive experience with Fios.  A discussion about the documentary "Blackfish" and its critique of SeaWorld's treatment of killer whales followed, sparking broader conversation about animal captivity, with Norton expressing a particular dislike for goats.  The show then delved into a detailed, often vulgar, debunking of a Chris Angel magic trick involving a steamroller, with a caller from Canada contributing to the discussion, comparing Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales.

The next segment focused heavily on Alex Rodriguez's steroid scandal and his walkout from his arbitration hearing.  Clips from A-Rod's interview with Mike Francesa were played, and the hosts, along with callers, engaged in a lengthy and often offensive discussion about the accusations, A-Rod's behavior, Bud Selig, and the MLB's motivations. This segment also included a brief mention of Opie's upcoming Netflix special and a caller’s humorous air compressor impersonation, followed by a quick mention of their appearance on Red Eye with Ann Coulter and Dean Cain.  Further discussion included a critical (and vulgar) analysis of a Criss Angel magic trick, which was contrasted with a seemingly amateurish but charming "Shaq Balloon" video. Carrot Top was mentioned in relation to the Shaq Balloon.


The following segment began with a discussion surrounding the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination, incorporating reactions to a new documentary and opinions on Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.  A historian guest (unnamed) contributed to the discussion of conspiracy theories. This was followed by discussions of George Zimmerman's recent arrest for domestic violence, the "knockout game" (described with highly offensive racial slurs), and a humorous video of a news reporter falling on an ice rink. A caller shared a story about his niece's assault, leading to a discussion about violence in schools and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.  The show continued with commentary on Sean Penn berating a fan, critical remarks about a photo of Kendall Jenner (including comments about her breasts and comparisons to Kim Kardashian and Bruce Jenner’s alleged comments), and a brief mention of TMZ headlines and Miley Cyrus' bleached eyebrows.  This led to a comedic segment involving videos of horses, culminating in a failed search for a video of an angry horse. The segment concluded with a critique of a Variety article criticizing Sarah Silverman’s comedy, followed by a heated debate about hunting ethics in Africa (featuring highly offensive language and graphic descriptions) with a listener calling in to share his experiences.

A rambling segment followed, starting with a discussion about abortion, transitioning into criticism of a woman who killed a lion, and then into a discussion of hunting ethics and personal hunting stories.  The hosts criticized a woman on Twitter, discussed airport security and TSA procedures (including a host's experience with confiscated toothpaste), and debated airport security profiling.  They then discussed Southwest Airlines' gate-to-gate Wi-Fi, interspersed with listener calls, including a story about a broken floor. A significant portion was dedicated to a Dennis Leary comedy bit about smoking and animal preservation, with plugs for Jim Norton's Netflix special, "American Degenerate."  The hosts engaged in a humorous bit about vegetarians, discussed a 747 landing at the wrong airport, and further listener calls concerning airplane landing gear malfunctions and a song about getting high on an airplane. The segment concluded with plugs for the Opie and Anthony podcast and live shows.

The final segment featured an in-studio interview with actor Vince Vaughn, promoting "Delivery Man." Vaughn discussed his acting approach, collaborations, and his movie "Swingers."  After the interview, the hosts and E-Rock discussed Vaughn's career and public persona.  The majority of the segment focused on a highly critical (and profane) recounting of their experience at Kanye West's "Yeezus" tour, detailing the stage production, West's behavior, and audience reaction, with Roland providing rambling commentary. The show concluded with a commercial break.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Metalcore has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, the last you didn't.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make a fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, hearty horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  Oh, yeah.  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  That's what they call it. 
[00:02:00]  It's the name they gave me.  What was that from again?  Uh, past times.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Jeff Spicoli.  It's the name they gave me.  Ah, just came out of the, uh, bathroom and I just can't stop.  Yeah.  Wow.  Out of the closet.  Uh, just listening to the girls toss the ball around.  What do you mean?  Eh, they were on.  Oh, they were already on?  The mashups on in, uh.  Morning mashups style.  In the bathroom.  It was just like, uh, Kelly Clarkson's pregnant, uh, or preggers, as, uh, Nicole said. 
[00:02:30]  And the guy's gotta make believe they give a fuck?  Exactly.  That was the whole thing.  That's why we call them the girls.  The girls.  The ladies.  Throwing the ball around.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Just throwing it around and then, uh.  Was there a joke after that?  Uh, no.  It was like, uh, uh, you know, good for her.  You go, girl.  Because she looks like she's been pregnant for years.  That's the joke.  The excuse for her being fat.  Right.  So finally, finally she's got that excuse.  Exactly. 
[00:03:00]  Old Chubb.  And then, uh, I don't know, they said something like, uh, Eminem, uh, perhaps getting back together  with his wife, Kim.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Do tell.  I, I, I hung out by the urinal for an extra shake or two just to hear what they were  going to say about it.  Oh, man.  I feel bad for those guys.  I hope they're banking at least.  For whoring themselves out that way.  Oh, man.  The fuck?  I would love to know what they would like to talk about.  Because they, they don't want to talk about that nonsense.  Same thing here. 
[00:03:30]  Tits.  Pussy.  Then you go around the other side.  The shit that comes out.  I see.  You know, all that good stuff that we like to carry on about.  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Wowie kazowie.  Oh, man.  You said something.  I was going to say something.  Oh, damn it.  That's how it usually works.  You said something.  Then I was going to say something.  And now I forgot what I was going to say.  Then I say something.  Shit.  And then it's 10 o'clock and we did a show.  That's right.  It was about pop culture.  Eminem.  Oh.  I don't know.  Kelly Clarkson. 
[00:04:00]  Eminem.  Preggers.  Kim White.  We did a fight back together again.  The girl throwing it around.  I don't know.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  We were stupid enough to get off on the 36th floor.  Or we attempted to.  You did?  You and Kenny?  Yes.  And then we were met with plastic.  Oh, boy.  A wall of plastic.  I saw that.  Because they're putting their rocks down in the lobby.  Yes.  All their new rock tile work.  Their slate.  I think it's more of a slate. 
[00:04:30]  It's kind of a thick slate.  It does look nice.  It looks a little cheap, to be honest with you.  Does it?  Yes.  I saw it.  It looks a little cheap.  They cut some corners with their slate.  Same shit they're going for up on the 37th floor.  Right.  Yes.  And then we had to go up on the 37th and see the slate work.  And I guess that's what they're doing on this floor.  I don't really see where it makes that much of a difference.  I got off on the 37th.  And I know it cost a fucking fortune to put in.  I looked at the floor when I got off on the 37th. 
[00:05:00]  And I'm like, oh, this is what it's going to look like.  And I just looked around like, oh, big shit.  And that's going to help the product.  Why?  How?  Why?  That's where the money, they need the money, I guess.  So we can't do our event because they need the money.  Right.  Didn't talk to Scott.  No, I didn't go down.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  There's kind of no need to.  I mean, what's there to say?  I mean, he's not going to make a decision like that.  Right.  Based on anything I say to him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  We can't get our agent in town to fucking work on it. 
[00:05:30]  I don't think we have an agent at this point.  It's just crazy.  He went rogue, I think.  Oh, he went rogue years ago.  Not stupid.  Comes in every once in a while to negotiate a little bit for us.  Yeah.  That's it.  Average at best deal.  Yeah.  And then he goes away for a year or two.  Yeah.  And then he actually calls every once in a while to say hi.  I don't want my agent calling to say hi.  Just check it in.  How you doing?  When that phone rings, it means you're dealing with something. 
[00:06:00]  Hi.  Oh, I'm just calling to say hi.  Oh, that's good.  Because the whole fucking show is imploding.  Thanks.  Thanks for the hi-hat.  The how do you do.  Hey, how you doing?  I just wanted to call and say hi.  Oh, my gosh.  It's really good.  I don't even take hi phone calls from my own family.  I'm not going to take it from my agent.  Phone calls.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Post things.  Well, you should know how things are if you listen to the actual show that you represent. 
[00:06:30]  Text me.  Huh?  That's how I feel about everybody.  Just text me.  When that fucking phone rings, I, like, adrenaline shoots through my body.  It's like, why isn't somebody just texting me?  Right.  I'm not a big phone call guy.  No.  Time Warner sucks a dick.  Oh, my gosh.  Let me tell you why.  We've had problems with our cable system for a while now.  And I finally said, all right, fuck, let's get a guy in here. 
[00:07:00]  Uh-huh.  And then he comes rolling in to tell me that my cable boxes are really old.  Great.  But I know I had a guy in recent memory that was in there.  Uh-huh.  And I'm thinking to myself, shouldn't they be sending out some kind of literature or letter  or a phone call or text saying, hey, we, our records are showing you have really old boxes,  so we got to, you know, have a guy come in and update you?  You'd think that would be nice.  How would I know that they're old and that's why a lot of the shit was fucking up, including 
[00:07:30]  the DVR system?  That's the same note that they got in Martha Stewart's channel.  Old boxes, I guess.  Of course.  Bourdain had a great fucking tweet about Martha.  Martha.  There's the Long Island accent for everybody.  The Martha.  Martha Stewart.  Oh, and Nancy Grace.  Yeah.  What was the exact tweet?  I want to fuck it up.  Anthony Bourdain is a rock star.  They should combine something about they should combine Martha Stewart's pictures.  Pictures of her food with Nancy Grace's hashtags. 
[00:08:00]  Nancy Grace's.  What the hell happened?  What happened there?  Oh, there we go.  Oh, there's a new one.  That's a new one.  Oh, that's good.  If you hit the console, the mics go out.  That's interesting.  It's brockin'.  Oh, that's not brockin'.  Oh, so the guy comes to say, oh, wow, these boxes are really old.  How the fuck should I know that?  Yeah.  It's not like they're 10 years old, 5 years old.  They're maybe 2 years old is what I'm getting at. 
[00:08:30]  And you're not up on the technology of cable boxes.  Who is?  So then, this company where my cable bill is well over $200 a month, and I'm not doing anything too crazy.  I just got, you know, basic packages.  I don't even have the sports packages, to be honest with you.  I'm paying over $200.  So he's got boxes, and I go, oh, that's great.  You're giving me new boxes.  He goes, well, actually, no.  These are old, too.  Well, why?  I don't know!  Oh, my God.  So, I mean, if you're going to someone's house, or in my case, an apartment, 
[00:09:00]  wouldn't you have the latest boxes for at least that dickhead?  Meaning me?  You'd think.  So he replaces the cable boxes with other cable boxes that are old.  Is it still rebooting?  Probably.  Oh, it's ridiculously slow.  I can't even deal.  Ridiculously slow.  And I've got to tell you, Fios, when you reboot your Fios box, which you have to do once  in a blue moon, as they say, it's so fast. 
[00:09:30]  There's no reason that Time Warner Cable should take you upwards of 10 minutes to reboot the  fucking box.  With Time Warner Cable, we give you old boxes.  You want an old box?  We got them in the truck.  I'll be right back.  Ah, Travis.  So, they work.  Yeah.  But because they are also old boxes, it's just a matter of time before I have the exact same  problem.  Exactly. 
[00:10:00]  I've been told I had the same issue as you when we had some issue and we needed a new  box.  Right.  They told me, we only give new boxes to new customers.  What about the customers that have been with you forever?  They're a terrible fucking company.  They're a terrible fucking company.  The worst.  They're cutting corners and they, you know, it's going to be expensive to give everyone  the new boxes, so they roll them out slowly.  So, basically.  If you get a nice guy, you can like, my guy ended up being nice and he found someone who 
[00:10:30]  was in the area who had a new box on his truck.  Dude, you can get Fios to your brother.  My guy looks fucking miserable.  Dude, you should, you will cream yourself if you get Fios.  I don't believe in fucking iPhones or a Fios.  Oh my God, Fios is the best.  Sorry.  I love the fact that I still get a letter from Time Warner and it's just nice just to throw  him out.  What a garbage company.  Well, if you're going to stay with Time Warner, then you should tell them that you're leaving.  Say, yeah, come in and rip this shit out.  I'm going to Fios.  And they'll be like, new box, new box, free service, six months. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  They'll give you everything.  I threatened to leave when the whole CBS thing was going on.  I have $50 off my bill every month.  That's nice.  Yeah, see?  No intention.  And they'll bring you a new box, I bet.  And here's the other thing that Time Warner does.  That's why I love that we have a radio show.  So you have an appointment, right?  Yeah.  So they call you four days out, then they call you three days out, then they call you  two days out, and you have to go through the, if you speak English, push one, if you made 
[00:11:30]  an appointment, push two, if your appointment is from blah, blah, to blah, blah, push one  again, if you are going to keep this appointment, push.  So it takes you a few fucking minutes, which is an eternity in that world, obviously.  Three days out, two days out, one day out.  Oh, one day out, they call you two or three times to make sure you're positive, and then  day of, they're pretty much calling you every hour.  And it's not someone on the phone going, hi, we've got a cable guy on the way, just 
[00:12:00]  want to let you know.  They've got to run through the automated menu.  They've got to run through the automated fucking menu.  And you know what happens if you don't pick up your phone on the day of?  They'll cancel you.  They'll cancel the fucking...  Dude, I was in the bathroom, and I missed the phone call, and I listened to the voicemail  and said, you've not picked up your phone.  We've canceled your appointment.  I called them around and said, what the fuck are you doing?  Oh, my God.  But how insecure are they?  They have to ask you a million times if they're, you know, if they're still needed.  That's so they could cancel you, so they could have less people working and send out... 
[00:12:30]  Right.  When you came back, when you called back, did they just put you on?  They ended up, yeah, sending somebody over.  I think they're a terrible company.  They're the worst.  They're the worst company.  Yeah.  And I'm so happy to leave them.  It's just so satisfying.  Files rules.  It's so much better.  However, you guys don't get the new relaunched New York One, which is now Time Warner Cable  News.  Ooh!  Relaunched?  What?  It's not New York One anymore.  New York One is the worst fucking channel on TV.  It's horrendous.  It's worthless. 
[00:13:00]  That's why it's gone.  It's horrendous.  And it's the default channel that it goes to when the box boots, or you turn it back  on.  So it's the first thing you see usually when you turn on the TV.  And you've got to figure out how to...  You've got to go into your settings to make it turn back on from the last channel you were  on.  It'll default to just turning onto that channel.  Because I have a Time Warner Cable at the Compound West.  Lucky you.  And I can't get off that New York One fast enough.  I usually just hit the channel a few times before I even go to Guide, because I don't  want to listen to New York One. 
[00:13:30]  Just automatically go to Two.  Two.  Yes, Two.  I'll get what it is.  They're monotone.  They're ugly looking.  Their clothes are old.  They got nothing.  Their graphics suck.  They got some dude named Dean Memminger that just sits there awkwardly.  Dean Memminger.  You don't like the guy who hosts the morning show?  Oh, God, no.  They're horrendous.  Read the papers bit.  Oh, God.  I don't think I've ever seen that, to be honest with you.  He literally reads the papers.  Sounds great.  So, I don't watch it.  Whoever does the morning show on Time Warner Cable News. 
[00:14:00]  I love good paper reading.  Do you?  I told Cablevision to go fuck themselves years ago and went to Fios, and it was fucking  great.  I had a problem last night with the On Demand thing you recommended.  What happened?  It was just a couple times it stalled.  Like, just stuttered.  Yeah.  And then I had to pause, then stop it and restart it, and then it was fine.  Yeah.  It's like, that never happens with Fios.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was fine in five minutes.  All right.  So, we were watching a documentary yesterday.  What documentary were you watching?  That goddamn Blackfish, it's called, about the killer whales at SeaWorld, and they focused 
[00:14:30]  on that Tilikum one that we did a bid on years ago.  Yeah, didn't he get fucked or something?  Some guy put his penis in the blowhole, right?  I don't know if that was that or if the guy jumped in and the thing just killed him.  Yeah, it looks now like the guy.  But there was a story that came out that he, thank you, Sam, he put his penis in the fucking  blowhole, because I remember the name of the killer whale, because, like I said, the  name always matches up with the story.  It did rip his genitals off, so I don't know if that was... 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, you're tired of getting fucked.  And they were saying that he probably was dressed when he went in, and the whale just ripped  his clothes off, chewed him up, fucking, and then just was swimming around with the thing  on its back.  Like, he put it on its back, on his own back, and swam around.  Trying to parade it around a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, like, look what I did.  Don't fuck with me, humans.  This killer whale killed three fucking people.  Really?  Yeah, three people, injured others, and just like, and they just kept, like, like a Catholic 
[00:15:30]  priest, they would just send it off to another park.  It was insane.  Wow.  And the way, they showed how they got it when it was a baby.  They just herded these killer whales and their babies into these little coves.  Right.  With using explosives and boats and airplanes and shit, and then just separated from the  mother.  Well, hold on, there was the one part where they're fucking, they're chasing the whales  in a boat, and this is how smart whales are. 
[00:16:00]  They sensed that they were trying to get the babies, so the three of the adults led the  boats on a fucking goose chase the other way, and then the mothers and the babies swam,  like, kind of went off on this other direction, and so the boats followed the other whales.  They outsmarted the boats.  Yeah.  But helicopters saw them when they, or planes saw them when they came up for air, so then  of course the boats backed up and went and got them.  And then they got that burly fisherman telling the story, and he's fucking, like, crying.  Yeah, how guilty he felt about it.  He felt so guilty as they're loading the baby into this container, and the mother is just, 
[00:16:30]  like, crying, and the other whales are popping out of the water, like, all making noises  and talking to each other, and then he realized, he's like, oh my god, these, this is like  a little community that's grieving.  Kidnapping a baby.  Yeah, he said, I felt like it was kidnapping a baby.  Humans deserve everything they're going to get in the end.  Oh, it was.  They stink.  It was so bad.  And I never thought.  They just stink.  Everyone thinks SeaWorld is pretty harmless, you know? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  You just kind of, you go down there, the whales jump around, but you assume that they're treated  better than they would be treated in the ocean, you know?  They're not?  No.  They're supposed to be out in the fucking ocean swimming around, having, like, thousands  of miles of fucking area to...  Well, stupid me, I thought all those killer whales and those exhibits, whatever, were ones  that kind of saved and...  Right, right.  And it was like, look, we know if we put him back out of the ocean, he's going to be  fucked, so, you know, so that's why we have them, but we do treat them very nice in between 
[00:17:30]  shows and this and that.  And they were kidnapped.  All of them were kidnapped.  Yeah.  They try to portray it as this family unit also, and it's like, no, they have their families  when they're in the wild.  They're pods, you know?  They swim around in, and they have these distinct languages and movements that are indicative  of these separate pods.  And when you put them all together, it would be like if they just threw us in a small,  tiny room with someone from, like, Japan, someone from Russia, someone from another... 
[00:18:00]  Like, all these countries where you can't communicate with each other, different cultures  that no one understands.  You could say it, black people.  Well, of course, Africans.  You could say it.  I know you wanted to say it.  As soon as you go with Japan, I'm like, come on.  Japan.  Japan.  Yeah, Japan.  Now, cultures that you don't understand and whatnot.  Well, when they took the baby from...  There was a mother that had a baby in captivity.  Oh, yeah.  And then they were swimming together and doing...  The baby was getting a little rambunctious. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  So they took the baby to another...  Yeah, just took them to another park.  ...water park.  Separated it.  And they said the mother just was sitting there making these really weird grieving noises,  and they brought in an expert to hear the noises.  It's lonely.  Right.  But that's what it was.  They said that the mother was trying to look for the baby.  It's just fucking...  SeaWorld is a despicable, despicable place.  And they show how management is over there, and they got an excuse for everything.  And then the trainers who, you know, some of these people applied for a job as like, 
[00:19:00]  you know, the guy that sweeps up SeaWorld and ends up a fucking trainer for the killer whales.  And, you know, they...  I think they authentically appreciated the animals and wanted to do the right thing.  But they were towing the company line with all the bullshit that they have to run through  and say that are all lies about the health and welfare of these animals.  And they're saying that now.  Like, I'm embarrassed that I said that.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I towed that company line.  I can't believe I said that.  Yeah, they were showing clips of one of these women going like,  and the whales love doing these behaviors. 
[00:19:30]  And she's like, I can't even watch this.  It's embarrassing.  So what's going to happen?  He looks like Muffet.  Now that there's an awareness, that's getting out.  Yeah, hopefully they'll close eventually.  Eventually they'll close.  Because you watch the people in the audience.  A lot of money.  You can't get mad at them because they don't know.  They're just having fun.  I mean, I never knew.  Most of the trainers go there.  And then one guy said he stayed because I felt worried about this whale.  I was worried.  I felt sorry for Telecom.  I didn't want to leave him.  It's a despicable fucking thing. 
[00:20:00]  And it's really, it's torture of these animals.  They're torturing these fucking smart animals.  A whole bunch of people want to call us out like a bunch of pussies.  Probably.  We're on the top of the food chain.  They're here to entertain us.  I was at a SEAL show.  The Riverhead has an aquarium.  This summer I went there, and there was a little fucking SEAL show.  The space that this SEAL had to work in was, I'm looking at the studio.  It can't be smaller than this studio.  Not much bigger than this was his whole world. 
[00:20:30]  His stage.  And his whole world, because I don't know where the fucking thing went after it was on stage.  And there was three, at least three, maybe four SEALs in this tiny little place.  And he's coming out of the fucking thing, and he's on his flippers and all that shit.  And I remember thinking to myself, I'm not into this shit anymore, man.  I don't like this at all.  It just feels extremely cruel now.  I tweeted last night, I don't care about a goat in a petting zoo. 
[00:21:00]  Fuck him.  Take him by his dumb horns and flop him on the ground.  Give him a shit about a dumb goat.  You don't need to hate the goat.  I hate the goat.  I'm sure their noises are annoying.  No, Jimmy.  I hate the goat.  Loving the whale doesn't, by proxy, make you have to hate the goat.  I hate it.  You just love one more.  But there is a genuine consciousness in these whales, like in their eyes.  I'm sure with most animals.  It's just amazing.  Those lifeless, dumb goat eyes.  They stare at you as they chew. 
[00:21:30]  Their jaw just goes sideways with their dumb, lifeless food eyes.  Yes.  Number one meat in the world is goat.  Doesn't like a good goat fucking sandwich.  Never had.  I haven't either.  I went to the Bronx Zoo recently as well.  Yankee Stadium.  Well, this is the type of stuff you do with a little kid.  And they do a much better job because they finally have given animals, finally, it's been  a while.  I've got to give them credit.  They give the animals a lot of space now.  Yeah.  Because what happened with zoos, because we're all fat, fucking lazy Americans, especially, 
[00:22:00]  that we want everything close and we don't want to walk too far to see a fucking giraffe.  Too far to walk.  Yeah.  You would have to go to Africa to see the giraffe.  So they bring these animals, these exotic, amazing animals to you.  And it's not good enough that you have to walk around to see them.  And that's why they were always in those tiny little cages and shit.  Yeah, yeah.  That was for our pleasure.  The company line on SeaWorld was that, you know, you get these wonderful animals and they 
[00:22:30]  should be seen by people and marveled at.  And then you get the trainers that said, no, you know, they're not supposed to be seen  in that environment, in these giant tanks and stuff.  So if you want to see them and you're lucky enough, you could take a fucking cruise where  they're feeding or migrating and watch them in their natural habitat.  You said something there that's wrong, though.  Giant, what did you say, cages or tanks, whatever.  They're not giant compared to them. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, no.  Comparably speaking.  So at the very least, SeaWorld should try to figure out how they can make those things  a lot fucking bigger.  Maybe that would help a little bit.  I don't know.  It's like a bathtub.  They're just spending your life on a bathtub.  Oh, yeah.  It's tiny to them.  Their environment is at least hundreds of miles.  Like, that's on a day.  That's like walking around your living room and going to the bathroom and your kitchen.  To them, that's hundreds of miles.  And then if you want to just, like, go from your house to the store, like, to them, that's  thousands of miles. 
[00:23:30]  They have so much space in their natural environment that you can't replicate that in some kind  of tank.  Right.  It just can't be done.  The other thing about the Bronx Zoo, it was a final thought.  So the old cages.  Oh, right.  They used to put them in cages.  I mean, it was one after another.  Like, you could see a lion, a monkey, a panda, whatever the fuck.  Oh, Jesus.  And now they just grow plants in there.  Oh, really?  If you go to the Bronx Zoo, go check out the old plants in cages.  It's terrible.  I know.  Those poor things. 
[00:24:00]  They like to roam around, go to the store.  But it's kind of like that urban exploring shit.  They've left the old cages there.  They're being overgrown.  But I think they're trying to, you know, make it like it's important plants or trees or  something.  Yeah.  Fucking cool to look at.  I don't know.  I think people care, too.  I don't think people are indifferent to it.  Like, when a whale gets beached or fucking beaches itself, people are sad about that  and they run down and they try to help.  Like, I think if people know what's happening, 75% or 80% of people would be disgusted by  it and not want to support it.  Because they live in water, you have this separation from them. 
[00:24:30]  And I think that that has, over the years, made this where we feel we could just kind  of put them in a tank and watch them.  But you realize that they're even smarter than dogs.  And we love our little dumb pets and shit like that.  And they have that same emotion in their eyes and the same thought process, loyalties  and feelings and shit.  Yeah, it was pretty fucking sad.  Let's say hi to Jack in Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh, PA.  I like the whale.  What's up, Jack? 
[00:25:00]  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, I just started listening to your show a couple weeks ago when you guys came on.  And I was wondering, did you guys ever see that one documentary you guys are talking  about, the killer whales?  The cove?  They had a show on there about killer whales against a great white shark.  And they were showing how smart the whales are when they hunt.  They went there hunting manta rays and stuff like that, how they turn them upside down and  they go numb.  And they showed where there's two female killer whales that go out off the coast of San Francisco, 
[00:25:30]  which used to be a huge great white shark area.  That's where they went.  And now that these great white sharks don't come around, there's two females that go there  specifically to eat shark liver.  That's all they do.  It's amazing that you guys made that comment about how whales, if you think they're smarter  than dogs, if you ever get a chance, just watch it on Netflix or whatever, I think it's  on there.  It's amazing how smart.  They're pretty fucking smart.  They showed last night also in that documentary with the seal, the sea lion that was on this  little ice float.  Right.  And there were a bunch of killer whales around it. 
[00:26:00]  And they're poking their head up, looking at the sea lion.  And like fucking taking little chunks off of the ice flow.  And it's getting smaller and smaller for the sea lion.  And then they had this coordinated move that they did.  And they realized that, you know, they tried it with two killer whales.  They'd line up next to each other.  And they swim really fast toward the ice flow on the surface.  And then duck right under the ice flow at the last minute.  And this giant wave that they make washes on top of the ice flow.  Knocks them over.  And knocks the sea lion off the ice flow into the water. 
[00:26:30]  Well, two didn't do it at first.  Two didn't do it.  So, and I'm watching this going, they had to communicate to each other and go,  All right, look, two ain't cutting it.  You, come with us.  Will three of us do it?  And three didn't quite work.  So they got four.  And the four of them are completely in unison.  And they sound in the wild.  No human fucking is doing little things with whistles and fucking hand signals.  And they swam right next to each other, ducked out, and a giant wave just came out.  And washed them off.  And some woman, you could tell they were videotaping the whole thing. 
[00:27:00]  And some woman is like, oh no, oh no.  And what did the guy say?  He goes, if you can't watch the bullfight, yeah, if you can't take it, don't watch the bullfight.  Yeah, let's say, okay, this is how they eat.  This is nature, lady.  It really made me very, very, made me very sad.  And they said, by the way, there's been no documented attacks of killer whales on people in the wild.  None.  They've never hurt people out in the wild.  They're very gentle.  They don't fuck with you when you're out there.  But when they're caged up like that, they probably just get vindictive and angry and sick of it. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  They get this personality of something that's been locked up.  Right.  Depressed, frustrated, mad.  Irritable.  And they treat their trainers.  Kind of like us in this small studio.  They cage us up like this.  Where do you think this is coming from, you idiots down the hall?  They cage us up.  Right.  You guys put on a great show.  I'm glad I got a hold.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Oh, no, Jack from... 
[00:28:00]  Well, it's...  I don't know if they do.  I imagine they might.  I wonder what they're saying about this documentary.  They don't like it.  I think the big thing that's coming out of it is PETA doesn't want the fucking Shamu float balloon to be in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Which now, I thought, alright, whatever.  I don't like these symbolic protests.  I guess if it raises awareness, but I'd rather have people watch this documentary than go, hey, where'd the whale go for the balloon? 
[00:28:30]  I know what their thinking is, though, and I'm the same way with them.  Like, they annoy me on some level, and then there's a part of me that really likes them and really likes, like, Earth Liberation Front, because they're fucking...  They don't hurt people, but they're just violent towards these...  Like, they've tried the nice route.  It doesn't work.  And then they just kind of...  And I know it's probably shitty of me to say, but I like the fucking fact that they use a little bit of violence against these companies. 
[00:29:00]  You know what I think they should do?  Take the whale balloon out.  Replace it with Shaq balloon.  Shaq balloon.  Shaq balloon.  It's more believable.  The whale balloon, I mean.  People were studying Shaq balloon all day yesterday.  I was reading the wonderful...  Shaq balloon.  That was, by the way, Blackfish is the documentary.  It's on demand right now on Fios and stuff.  It's really, really good.  Yeah.  I was reading the tweets about Shaq balloon.  Shaq balloon.  A lot of theories.  A lot of theories, man.  Well, the latest, someone did study the tattoos, and there's no tattoos on Shaq balloon. 
[00:29:30]  No tattoos on Shaq balloon.  On Floating Shaq.  So that makes me believe it's Shaq balloon.  Uh-huh.  But now people are thinking it might be a combination of a couple things.  Of a couple of things.  A crane, where they have a small little platform that he's laying on with the clothes, like, over it.  Right.  That's hence the flat ass on Shaq.  But he's not moving at all.  I know.  He would not be able to not move for that long period of time.  But they might have told him, look, Shaq, I saw your acting prowess in Shazam. 
[00:30:00]  What was it?  Shazam.  Kazam.  Lazam.  Kazam.  Right.  Look, we need you to lay here still.  And Shaq's like, okay, I'll lay here still.  And then he just laid very still.  I'd have done that.  Nah.  No?  They never showed his head, because that's where the propeller was.  And they didn't show his head.  The propeller.  Shaq balloon propeller?  Yeah, absolutely.  Shaq balloon.  We've all been to hockey games where they have those indoor blimps.  Oh, yeah.  Just picture that.  But it looks like Shaq. 
[00:30:30]  Uh-huh.  So you've got to hide the propeller thing.  Why didn't they show his head the whole time?  I don't know.  I mean, you sort of saw it in the distance.  Like, the shot, like I said, his presentation stinks.  That's the problem with Criss Angel.  He should fire all his producers and stuff.  Because the shot would be seeing Shaq's head.  Yeah.  But they filmed it where you're seeing almost the bottom of his shoes.  His soles.  A lot of problems in the video.  So why aren't they showing his head?  You know why?  Because they don't have that shit figured out in the balloon technology. 
[00:31:00]  They can make it look like Shaq balloon, but they don't have the detail in the face yet.  That's Shaq's face.  It had to be helium, too, if it's a balloon.  Of course.  So you can't just put a propeller on it.  It would have floated away.  So it's tethered.  It has to be tethered at some point, or it would just keep floating away.  Oh, yeah.  They had some fucking fishing line on it.  Yeah.  I think it's a combination of things.  No, the propeller head thing is more.  You know, that's obviously a joke.  Oh, I know.  But look.  So you would never do this shot.  But it looks like green screen. 
[00:31:30]  When we get later, remember you pointed out the shoe?  It did look like green screen.  The part where he's coming down looked like green screen.  But the first shot proves it's not green screen because you see the glare underneath them.  But it could be a combination of things.  I think the green screen at the end where you could see his foot was too weird.  Like, that might not be.  That's a balloon.  That's a fucking balloon right there.  Look at Wobble.  That looks like Shaq's balloon.  The Wobble fucks it up.  That's Shaq's balloon.  It's oscillating is what it is.  Like, the whole body's going like, whoa, just a slight oscillation.  You can see it moving.  Yes. 
[00:32:00]  A crane, nah, wouldn't be able to control that.  And they don't show his head.  If they're actually using Shaq, they would show his head.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Where does it look like green screen, right?  Like, next shot.  Right when they stop bringing him down.  The next shot in front of the garage.  Like, right around here.  Right there.  That looks like green screen.  That looks like green screen.  It did.  Possibly, yeah.  It probably is because he's too close to do the balloon.  Oh, they, okay.  Yeah, because at that point they wanted to be more believable.  So they're like, okay, we'll green screen Shaq in here. 
[00:32:30]  I'm not giving up on the fact that this is a fucking balloon.  I absolutely think Shaq balloon was used.  Shaq balloon.  Oh, God.  So many people watched this yesterday and commented on it.  But then someone said there's no, here, go back to the roof shot.  Okay.  There's no shadows on the roof.  But now I've got to figure out where the sun is.  No, you've got to figure out where the sun is.  But we could do that.  Yeah.  Somebody pointed out that other trick where he pulls those people in half.  Right.  You could see the shadows change so much over time that you could tell that was hours and 
[00:33:00]  hours of filming.  That's what happened when I saw Copperfield.  Yeah.  He had some beach illusion.  I forgot now.  Someone buried in a hole or something.  And I was in the palm.  One of the states on Rape Island.  And the palm tree shadow with the big reveal.  Yeah.  The palm tree shadow went from, I'm visual here, from this to boom over here, which means  a lot of time passed by.  Like, why wouldn't you understand that part of it?  Right.  You either got to, you know, film it fast or you got to come back on another sunny day. 
[00:33:30]  Shaq rules.  Why would you show Flav's, if there's a man floating in the air due to magic, why are  you cutting to Flav or Flav?  Wouldn't you just have the floating guy?  Yeah.  Wouldn't news cameras be there and not looking at Flav or Flav?  You would think.  Look, the guy from Public Enemy.  Let's get him on film.  See the...  Silly.  I don't think...  The shots where you can see the sun glare on his back.  That's the balloon, obviously.  But here it gets too close. 
[00:34:00]  See, all that...  Yeah, that could be green screen.  It looks like green screen right there.  Right there.  It looks like green screen.  And beyond.  Go back one half an inch, Sam.  And that's the first time they actually show a lot more of his head.  No, go back a little bit more.  When he's first coming down, watch.  But you'll see that they're going to cut right there.  That looks like green screen.  Hold on, man.  I see something with his arms now.  His arms are different right there.  They're more folded.  Yeah.  Go back.  There's a 90 degree angle on his...  You have to go...  That's green screen. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  No, that's the...  Oh, boy.  See, his arms aren't as folded.  Yeah.  The wobble of the balloon.  The wobble is great.  When it's just over the roof.  That's wobbling, too.  That was a good wobble.  That's Shaq balloon.  Shaq.  That's Shaq balloon because you see the glare underneath.  And now there's no glare anymore.  And now there's...  Yeah.  That's the glare again.  God, come on.  Why can't you just put a camera...  Why would they have a bunch of camera angles? 
[00:35:00]  The floating man of magic is more impressive than the camera work.  Yes.  And they show the lady clapping.  Yeah.  Oh, stupid.  And then he gently lets Shaq's head down on the ground, even though it wasn't in that  position the entire time.  Everyone's like, oh, my God.  Fucking Shaq balloon.  I guess this wasn't meant to be put under the same scrutiny as the Zapruder film.  It was just a dumb one-off trick.  I know.  We're just picking it apart and reframe it.  We're shocked that it's not real magic.  We're secretly disappointed.  No.  It's more of a fucking... 
[00:35:30]  His presentation, he's lazy.  He's terrible.  He's fucking lazy.  Terrible.  And dubbed him possibly the worst magician of all time.  Of all time.  He makes a lot of money.  Because it's not a magician if you're doing stuff in front of people that are paid to be  like, ooh, ah, ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did Rob Ford say last night?  He said something new.  The fuck was this? 
[00:36:00]  Rob Ford.  Someone Twittered, the seals watch Blackfish and cheer.  It's all relative.  Yeah.  Let me...  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Jody in Canada.  Jody.  How is it going, boys?  Oh, you again.  It's a girl named.  Hi, Jody.  Hi, guys.  Welcome aboard.  God, I get excited.  I think we have a lot of Canadian listeners.  It's the same fucking guy.  Yeah.  We have one fucking listener in Canada.  His name's Jody. 
[00:36:30]  You guys thought your main fucking thing was in Montreal and Toronto?  I'm in the boonies in northern Canada.  Imagine that.  I don't want to.  Welcome to the show.  Is there snow on the ground?  Tundra?  There's fucking tons of snow on the ground.  It was minus 32 degrees Celsius here last night.  Why would you live for five?  What's minus 32 Celsius?  I don't want to do the math.  Is it zero?  No.  It's no way around.  32 here.  What is that Fahrenheit about?  That's fucking...  That's fucking cold. 
[00:37:00]  Nobody does, man.  That is fucking cold, is what it is.  Yeah.  It is fucking cold.  I would say it's minus...  Ten, I'm going to go with.  A girl I know who I was talking to, she got snowed in in Canada already.  She couldn't go to work because she was snowed in.  Wow.  Who's there?  Huh?  It's like zero.  It is zero.  Jimmy was right.  No.  Oh, yeah, I was right.  I just did 32.  I just did math.  32 degrees Fahrenheit is zero degrees Celsius.  Right.  But 32... 
[00:37:30]  It's not a...  Minus 32 degrees Celsius is not zero degrees Fahrenheit.  Did you just say at 32?  No.  What the fuck?  No.  It's a lot colder.  Wait, it's a lot colder than zero?  It's on a sliding scale of zero is freezing and 100 is boiling.  And that's Celsius.  So everything in between is relative between that.  Oh, is that how that works?  Yeah.  Is Fahrenheit dumber?  Well, some people think, like, if you work off the metric, if you work off the metric  system, it seems to be that the system we use is dumber than their system. 
[00:38:00]  Their system makes more sense.  A bunch of OCD.  They do love tens.  Ten hundreds boiling.  What's boiling in our system?  Eight million degrees.  Oh, I would have thought it was different.  Uh-huh.  It all depends on the altitude, but boiling is about...  How do you know that?  What is it?  I don't know.  Yeah, it's cold.  Why are you right?  Why do you know that?  It's cold as fuck, right?  It's colder than zero.  It's approximately cold as fuck. 
[00:38:30]  Cold as fuck.  We got it as cold as fuck on our chart.  Yes.  How much snow you got on the ground, Jody?  Uh, right now, there's probably about eight inches on the ground here.  Jeez.  Unbelievable.  And that's been, like, it snowed here a month ago.  Like, when was that?  A month ago.  I know.  I got...  I had that shit in Buffalo where it snows and it never goes away until spring.  I can't even imagine north of Buffalo what happens.  Other planet cold.  That's like other planet cold.  It's unbelievable, actually.  If we sent a probe to another planet and they recorded a temperature as cold as this 
[00:39:00]  guy's saying, we'd be like, oh, you can't live there.  When you walk on it, it's strange.  Yeah.  Because it's so fucking cold.  Yeah.  The sound doesn't travel the same way.  It sounds different when it's cold out.  Yeah.  It's just weird.  Oh, yeah, it does.  It's like an alien fucking world.  It's almost the same feeling as fingernails on a chalkboard when you walk because it's  like...  I can't explain it, but you get that squishy...  Yeah, yeah.  And it bothers your ears sometimes. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Plus, you have a little hat on.  It's all you can filter through a little hat over your little ears.  I can't stand the people that go, I can't wait.  Nice brisk.  I like a brisk morning.  You get up and breathe in that cold air.  You don't like brisk?  No, I hate it.  I would go through a pair of long johns every fucking season.  Yeah?  Yeah, and the back would be blown out from just farting.  Jesus Christ.  I didn't blow your farts.  And I was poor, so I only had one pair that I wore every fucking day. 
[00:40:00]  They'd give you one pair a year?  Or the same pair a couple of years?  One fucking pair.  Do you wear them?  I haven't worn long johns in 20 years.  No, not since leaving Western New York.  Every once in a while in New York, I'll throw them on.  But very rare.  And Jody, what do you got anyway?  Oh, it's Chris Angel bit.  There's one fucking, he's doing this fucking, one of his dumb fucking tricks, but he's going  to get rolled over by a steamroller, and he's going to fucking concrete, and you can  plainly see that there's a fucking concrete.  A fucking, fucking, fucking. 
[00:40:30]  A fucking what?  A fucking what fucking?  There's a fucking piece of the fucking concrete of the road where it's like four feet by seven  feet exactly where he lays.  So it's like, it grows over him, but you can plainly tell it's been a fucking mattress  there or something.  Oh, come on.  Let me see.  All right.  All right.  I got to see.  All right.  We might have a new one.  Chris Angel steamroller.  He just did.  Could I get a chipper fuck yeah?  What's that?  Could I get a chipper fuck yeah?  I didn't hear what you said, Jody.  What are you, a girl or something? 
[00:41:00]  Thank you, Jody.  Whatever.  Ready!  Oh, yeah.  Well, what is, yeah, what is that?  It's people.  It's a steamroller.  He's putting melons and other things in the shape of a person.  The magic fruit, man.  In some strange way.  Some strange.  They're not here.  Or maybe it's styrofoam.  Yeah.  This is solid. 
[00:41:30]  As solid as you can get.  Watch out.  Now he's going to run over this human that they built shaped out of melons and other things.  It's like a little demonstration that it's a steamroller.  Steamrolling over the fruit and shit.  Yeah, okay.  We get it.  Imagine if that was your foot.  That is fun to watch your steamroller run shit over.  Yes, great.  So I think we've illustrated the point that this is real.  What you see is what you get.  What you see is...  It was comical seeing, you know, the fruit salad that was made. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  It also was a reminder that seriously, if something goes wrong...  Oh, shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  That's right.  You get fucking fruit juice on you.  We have a special guest camera.  Oh.  We need a volunteer, right, to do this?  Oh, yeah.  A volunteer to video the whole thing.  So they give a plant a camera.  Plants can't use cameras.  Well, you know what I mean.  Some of the plants in the audience are garbage.  You know how to use this?  Yeah, I do it every time we do this thumb trick. 
[00:42:30]  That's enough to use it, Chris.  What's your name, man?  Colt Armstrong.  All right, we have Colt over here.  Why does Colt look...  He can be his nephew.  Yeah.  But I want you to see that we're using...  We smashed a bunch of glass.  Oh, God.  All right.  This is real.  You can touch it very gently, but it's real.  Am I right?  Yeah.  Honestly, this will cut you.  Why do they do it that way?  That's glass he's going to walk in.  Stop it, Chris.  You know, the question is, how is he going to endure that...  Mind-free consultant. 
[00:43:00]  What is a...  Banachek.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  All right.  Now he's walking on the glass.  In a demonstration of the mind, body, and spirit.  Put his shoes on.  I need to get myself to a place, a meditative state, where I'm completely in control of every  part of my body.  Yeah.  Is that what's going on?  Over-dramatic horse shit.  Now, if he's going to lay on this glass... 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Walking on it.  Yeah, he's going to walk on it first, I guess.  Yeah, but there's not even a lot of glass down there.  No, but he has something underneath the glass that makes it look like there's more glass.  Yeah.  And is he going to lay on that, because that is like a trap door or...  There's a lot of other junk on there.  You also don't need to...  Obviously, the stuff he's going to walk on isn't going to be the glass part. 
[00:44:00]  There's glass...  You see the glass is just here and there.  You also don't need to make it worse if you're going to be run away by a steamroller.  Yeah, who cares about walking on glass?  It doesn't matter what you're laying on.  Yeah.  Not only hitting steamroll, but the glass.  You see all the big pieces of glass are on the outside, so the spectators think the whole thing is glass.  But in the middle, the glass is crushed way down, and it looks like there's other shit in there.  That.  Oh, Christ. 
[00:44:30]  He just curled his toe to pick that up.  Yeah, but he's going to...  Why are they...  I don't know why he's on glass if he's going to lay on it, and the steamroller's going to crush him.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, enough with this dumb glass walking.  Yeah, let's fast forward a little bit.  Look, he almost stepped on that one.  Okay, now he's laying on the glass now.  He's going to lay down on glass and say, run a steamroller over him.  Another mind-free consultant.  Who's Johnny Thompson?  He's got two mind-free consultants.  We place blankets on the steamroller.  There's people in his family that need a paycheck. 
[00:45:00]  From spraying the audience.  I know.  I like it.  Come on.  All right, all right.  Wait, what happened?  Pause, pause, pause.  Here's the production designer.  This is the guy that should be fired right here.  What they did, to the rear of the big roller, they put these sheets over it, as they said,  to prevent debris from spraying at the audience.  Meanwhile, that is where you are going to either see or not see him crushed out the backside of the steamroller thing. 
[00:45:30]  All right, so...  What a punk of shit.  What a dumb trick, because the whole thing of this trick is you have to buy the fact that they put those blankets up to protect the audience.  But no one would believe that.  No.  That's what I'm talking about with his presentation.  It's the worst.  The trick itself, all right, clever, whatever.  Oh, no.  But he's lazy, unlike Penn and Teller, that spend years trying to figure out...  Yes.  They would never accept a sheet or a blanket on the side of a steamroll.  They would go, look, no one's going to believe that, so let's go back to our factory, figure out how we can do it. 
[00:46:00]  And we've got to figure this shit out better.  I figured out one of their tricks.  Penn and Teller?  The bullet one, like, he gets shot and he catches it in his mouth.  Yeah.  I figured that what happens is the gun is shot, and then Penn steps out of the way and ducks.  The bullet passes over his head.  He runs to the back, gets a fake bullet, puts it in, and then stands up all in the blink of an eye.  Wow.  That's amazing.  I've got to see that again.  He's very speedy.  All right, let's see this.  All right, he's, uh...  Put this on our Facebook page, Y-Rock. 
[00:46:30]  All right, he did the glass log.  Now he's laying on the glass.  Where are the sheets now?  On the side?  On the side.  On the side of the steamroller wheels.  The people are so far away.  Well, they're there to protect the audience, because, you know, when a steamroller rolls shit over, it flies out the side of the wheels.  But why sheets?  Why wouldn't you put, like, those things in a fucking tractor trailer using mudflap?  Or mudflap.  How about plexiglass?  That's what I'm saying.  Right!  So people can see still.  That's what I'm saying.  He's so full of shit. 
[00:47:00]  It's so hack.  Plexiglass.  It's hack.  And the steamroller, yeah.  And the stuff it's crushing is a lot narrower than the steamroller.  Can't fall!  So it would be impossible for it to shoot out the sides.  Yeah.  It's a camera.  God.  Oh, no.  Christ.  It's man versus machine.  Man versus machine.  Oh, what?  Look out.  Why don't they show the same camera?  I'm spraying the audience.  Look, look, that's a stupid. 
[00:47:30]  The steamroller is 19,650 pounds.  That you crush bone like that.  Oh, he's so dramatic.  So you want to go home going, how the fuck did he do this?  But right away you would go, that was stupid that they put the sheets on the side of the steamroller.  Uh-oh.  The steamroller is slowly rolling over the glass.  There's no debris flying out.  Of course not.  It's going a half a mile an hour.  Uh-oh. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  This is mind-free.  You know what?  They just leave the camera right there rolling over him.  Yeah, but they won't.  All right.  Let's see.  Uh-oh.  He's being run over by...  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  You can see he's under the...  Yeah.  You can see that he's under. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, no.  Chris Ains...  Look at Chris Ains' under.  You can see there's like a...  He's in a divot.  However...  Come on.  He's screaming.  I'm embarrassed.  I'm so embarrassed. 
[00:49:00]  You can see he's in a hole.  He's in a hole.  He's like standing up in a hole.  He's at me.  Get it off me.  Oh, he didn't go over his face.  Of course not.  No.  Oh, no.  How come they didn't show a roll off of him?  Why isn't he damaged?  And why did he have to move off of where he was?  Uh-huh. 
[00:49:30]  Wow.  I'll say this for him.  Yeah.  Even though it's obviously we saw what he just did.  The fact that you let a steamroller kind of crush you.  Well, no.  I mean...  If something goes wrong, he's in deep trouble.  That was a ball.  That's why his guys are like, okay, a little slower, a little slower.  He's getting it to his little hole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he knows how far he could go in the hole, and they know how far they could move  the steamroller before it would actually start doing damage.  Yeah.  The minute the wheel touches his heel, he's like, no, no, no.  It's not going well. 
[00:50:00]  Stop it.  Don't do it.  Now I know why the sheet's there, because he said the sheet is for the debris, but the  sheet isn't even covering up the whole fucking roller part.  It's only covering the back part of the roller part, because that's where the hole  would be.  You would see the hole at that point.  You'd see.  God!  What about the debris that flies out the front?  That doesn't matter.  Is that right?  Everyone's fine.  You know how people always say, I want a magician to tell me his tricks?  Now we see how they do it, we just get mad at the magician.  We get mad.  We get mad at the magic.  Yes.  The magic.  My point is really simple.  You want to go home and go, how the fuck? 
[00:50:30]  And you really want to think about it for a while.  You don't want to figure it out immediately.  You know what I think?  Steamroll the balloon.  Steamroll the balloon.  It's not a real steamroller.  It's a balloon.  Nice.  It only weighs like a few ounces.  And why would you have to put glass and stuff down on like a blanket or a sheet?  You're on the...  To camouflage the fact that it's a spring-loaded board that goes down.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  But Penn would never allow that because he would go, oh, they're going to be suspicious 
[00:51:00]  because they see that we're putting broken glass on a sheet in the middle of a road.  Yeah.  You wouldn't do that.  Why would you put it on a sheet?  Why not just throw it on the street?  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  But these are all the things that are dead giveaways that make it a lot easier to figure  out.  That's what it is.  Oh, God.  He stinks.  The worst magician.  And then he says the sheet's there so the glass doesn't hit the audience, but the steamroller's  barely moving, so there's not enough fucking energy and force to make it go flying out 
[00:51:30]  the sides.  They had to come up with something.  Plus it's narrow, so you know there's not even a chance that would ever happen.  No.  And then he doesn't even cover half the wheel after saying that's why he's covering the  wheel.  Yeah.  Wheel, the fucking roller, whatever.  His presentation is just awful.  And you have to believe the setup before you can believe the trick, you know?  Right.  You know it's a trick, but you've got to really believe the setup.  They can't just throw things in. 
[00:52:00]  It's like, oh, I'm going to do this trick.  I'm going to make a car disappear.  Wow, that's a cool fucking trick.  Yeah, I'm going to put the car up on this giant box.  Right.  Why are you doing that?  Like, instantly, you're like, well, why would you do that?  Right.  I don't know, because we need something to put the car in?  Right.  Like, you've got to buy the whole premise.  Right.  Yeah, like when you're, when you, that's, that's, that's more than half the whole thing. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  You have to work hard to figure out what, what people aren't going to be suspicious of.  Right.  What they're not going to be suspicious of.  You know when you hear the steam, about the steamroller trick?  Yeah.  That there's an easy way to do it, and you're like, yeah, but I want to see the way Criss Angel's  going to do it to make me think, whoa, what if he's, oh, he just did it the, he just did  it the easy way.  Oh, he did it the easy way.  Oh.  Yeah, I gotcha.  Oh, okay.  Ah-ha.  Yeah.  Ah-ha.  Yeah.  Ah, well, once again, we, uh.  It's not as great as Shaq Balloon, but. 
[00:53:00]  I love Shaq Balloon.  Shaq Balloon's the greatest trick ever done in magic.  That could be.  Shaq Balloon rules.  Fuck Houdini and his goddamn milk can of water.  And it's all because.  I like the Shaq Balloon.  It's all because Carrot Top's Shaq Balloon joke didn't work.  Oh, no, I, uh, Carrot Top is there.  Oh.  Yeah, because he supplied the balloon.  That's why I love the Twitter.  That's his house.  What?  It's Carrot Top's house?  Was that his house?  Yeah, because somebody recognized one of his cars.  Okay.  In the garage, or one of the shots, I guess, shows a really nice car, and I guess Carrot 
[00:53:30]  Top, you know, is known for having that particular car.  And Shaq just comes over and plays ball?  Fuck, Shaq just came over, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a nice house in Vegas to have, fucking.  That's a cool life, man.  Shaq.  How awkward is it when the truck pulls up and they pull Shaq Balloon out of the back?  It's like, all right.  If this goes, well, this is how we're going to do it.  Here's the pump.  Oh, God.  Right.  Yeah.  Or you're at the gas station.  You're at the fucking gas station.  You pull out Shaq Balloon. 
[00:54:00]  It's like, oh, yeah.  Put a quarter in.  I need another quarter.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Old school.  That's a damn funny impression of an air machine.  I just would have went, whoa.  Someone also said about Shaq Balloon that one of the feet, a foot is not inflated properly. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no.  He said if you look closely, you can tell.  Embarrassing.  Can you go back to Shaq Balloon?  I've got to see if this is true.  Again, let's look at Shaq Balloon.  Look, I didn't.  I just laughed out loud when I read the tweet yesterday, but I didn't go back there to  see if this was the truth.  But let's see.  You know what?  That foot's a little.  His ankle's a little hangy.  It's hanging.  It is hangy.  It looks a little flat. 
[00:55:00]  The left foot.  Go to the video.  You know, people are going to think Shaq Balloon is me.  I don't want to look stupid.  Shaq Balloon.  He doesn't have it as Shaq Balloon on his website there, Sam?  I don't know.  That would ruin the whole trick, wouldn't it?  Imagine he names his tricks everything that just exposes it.  Right.  Shaq Balloon.  Hole in the parking lot. 
[00:55:30]  Steamroller over hole.  What a lazy fuck.  He's awful.  All right, let's see.  The last time.  Unless we find something else.  Of course.  Look at the feet.  See if one is...  I don't know.  Trucking sneakers.  Plus, Carrot Top has a nice fence around his house.  Oh, yeah.  Which is a big, you know...  Big wall.  Got a big stone wall.  Come with me. 
[00:56:00]  Come with me, everybody.  Come with me.  There's obviously a crane there somewhere taking these pictures for a...  Good point.  Right.  Whoa.  That's a big-ass Carrot Top house.  Whoa.  Look out.  Shaq Balloon's coming down.  Shaq Balloon.  I love Shaq Balloon.  You want one?  That's still Shaq Balloon.  Yeah.  And then I think Jimmy's right. 
[00:56:30]  I think there's a switcheroo right here.  Either a crane or a green screen.  Because now you can see Shaq's complete profile.  For the first time, by the way.  And then...  And then gently putting his head on the driveway.  His magic is camera tricks and editing.  That's not an illusion.  Anyone can do that.  No.  My brother used to make us disappear with his 8mm Kodak camera. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  He's just like Criss Angel.  Stop already.  Right.  What's going on?  Criss Angel.  What's going on?  Believe.  What's going on?  Hope.  I must believe.  What's going on?  I'm showing Santa picture of my cock.  He has to see it.  But he wants it without my sweats.  Oh.  It's much bigger than I thought.  Exactly.  It's all forced perspective.  Oh.  I just have...  I'm laying in the background of the Empire State Building.  This is...  Boo.  What a great story.  A big plane.  This giant cargo 747. 
[00:57:30]  Massive.  It's huge.  It's made for cargo.  It's got an extended...  Cock...  Cabin.  Yeah.  Cock...  Cabin.  It's giant.  Right.  Wow.  And it landed at the wrong airport.  Right.  And the airport it landed at is too small for it to take off from now.  Come on.  So it's stuck there.  What are they going to do?  It doesn't have a long enough runway to take off.  Why did it land?  I don't know.  It said landed at wrong airport.  They must have. 
[00:58:00]  But how is it able to land if this runway is too small?  You could land at a shorter runway than you could take off from.  Okay.  I did not know that.  Yeah.  So he fucking lands at the wrong airport.  Now they can't take off.  So what the fuck are they going to do?  I don't know.  That's a...  Make the runway longer so they can get their plane back.  It might be worth their while.  Yeah.  They might have to extend the runway.  If they can though.  Who knows if it's in the neighborhood or there's zoning laws.  You can't.  How much does that plane cost?  Something like that. 
[00:58:30]  Oh my God.  Dude, that's a $50,000.  $50,000.  Jimmy.  You're going to have to fucking eat.  It's not that expensive.  And how about the emergency fucking slide that deployed mid-flight on a plane?  Oh, that's a good one too.  Inside.  Inside the cabin.  What if they got Chris Angel to levitate the plane?  Oh my God.  Perfect.  To a different airport.  How about just...  Balloon plane.  Airplane balloon.  Airplane balloon.  Airplane balloon.  Yeah.  Just get Chris Angel there to levitate that shit.  Yeah.  Airplane balloon.  Nice.  What do you mean it opened in the cabin? 
[00:59:00]  Did it crush people?  No, no, no.  The emergency slide is part of the door, I guess.  It opened inside.  Maybe look it up.  I thought...  That must have been huge.  It must have been very scary that they were going to blow the door off.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Anything.  I was watching a show with...  JetBlue.  Their planes are starting to get a little old.  They've had a few problems.  I remember when they first hit.  Yeah.  You like being on JetBlue flight because everything was brand new.  Brandy new.  Yeah.  There was another show last night on an airplane. 
[00:59:30]  A couple of airplanes.  The top of the fuselage just opened up.  Bam!  The roof?  Yeah.  And people were sitting there and they could see daylight.  And they heard like this hard whooshing sound of air going by.  And...  They landed?  That was that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They landed.  Wow.  In both cases.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, this is not the famous...  I think.  I think it was Southwest.  Oh boy.  Wow.  Wow.  I better get that right.  And it was metal fatigue, they said. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Metal fatigue.  But the plane wasn't even supposed to be inspected yet for overall metal fatigue, but  it was one of these short hop planes, so it has to pressurize and depressurize a lot  more often than a plane that flies a longer period of time.  It's also like, I think if you're standing up, you're in danger of being sucked out, but  if you're strapped in on your seatbelt, once the initial suction is gone, it's just,  you're probably not going to get sucked out, right? 
[01:00:30]  It's got to be scary, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Once the pressure equalizes, then there's no danger of you getting sucked out.  But when the cabin's pressurized and then a hole rips in, all that pressurized air has  got to get out of the plane.  And the pilot has to put the plane in a nosedive and try to get down to breathable air for the  passengers.  Those masks only last so long.  Are there any pictures or anything from inside the cabin?  There was video.  There was actually video of the people. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, they showed the roof.  It was a few years ago, so it wasn't good video.  Was it United?  It might have been.  It wasn't United.  I remember there was a small hole in the roof.  No, this was, I'm pretty sure it was Southwest.  Why don't we find the video?  We'll play it after the break.  Yeah, we'll take a look.  How about this?  Find the video.  The boss wants it.  We're going to do that, hopefully?  Oh, shit.  Find it.  No, Aloha Air was the other one where the entire sides and top came off of a plane.  And there are people sitting there like they're in a convertible airplane. 
[01:01:30]  A woman got sucked out.  A flight attendant was sucked out at 30,000 feet.  That's the one right there, yeah.  Imagine having to sit there, strapped in, and land.  Hey, as long as you land.  As long as you fucking land.  Roof ripped off airplane.  Yeah, that's a few of you.  That's it, right?  That's Hawaiian Air, I think.  Oh, wow.  That was a different one.  This one, it just made a split.  That was one right there, Southwest.  After everything gets ripped apart, would you still go to the bathroom?  Yeah, you get up. 
[01:02:00]  I'd go right there in my pants.  Right there, pissing shit like everybody else in the cabin.  Oh, man, having a window seat that day had to suck.  Dude, they're sitting right there looking at the sky.  That's got to be creepy.  That is wild.  Yeah, that's one.  There's a picture of the hole in the top of the plane.  Oh, maybe, yeah.  I guess maybe this is what I'm thinking of.  Crazy.  Right, yeah.  If you go to the bottom left picture, Sam, that was the one.  Yeah, right there.  Imagine that?  It's like how there's a hole in the plane, and it apparently is so loud.  That air fucking going by a hole in your plane is loud. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, you think it's a bit of a whistle?  Yeah.  A little whistle.  A really loud whistle.  Ah, Chip.  No, you wouldn't have.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Yeah.  Other things to do.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  What up, my niggas and niggas? 
[01:03:00]  Niggas and niggas?  There's another Opie and Anthony Show radio.  Niggas.  Niggas.  I went on a date with some chick once and went to the fucking bathroom, and there's  the guy that's one of the fucking chefs, and he takes a fucking piss, and then he just  kind of straightens his hair in the mirror and walks out.  And I got a fucking, and then he went and made this pizza or something, and I see him 
[01:03:30]  back there.  How do you even know he's, oh, he saw him making pizza.  It's one of those kitchens that are, the dining room kitchen with the glass thing, and  he's making the pizza.  And you saw that guy in the bathroom.  And the fucking girl I'm with orders the pizza.  And I saw the fucking guy not wash his goddamn hands, and I wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't fucking eat it.  I'm fine with it.  He's like, try it.  And I'm like, I just shook my head.  I'm like, nah, and I'm like, I'm not hungry.  What's a pizza oven?  Like 400 degrees?  Yeah.  All right.  So, yeah.  Gross.  You're good.  It's disgusting.  You're good.  No.  You're good.  If he was making sushi or something, then I'd have a problem with it. 
[01:04:00]  Nope.  I'm with Anna on that.  Not eat it.  I mean, I wouldn't touch it if it's, I'm with you on not washing my hands, but I'm with  you on the fucking, if touching the food is a little weird.  No, I'm going to make you a great, uh, something special, and it said, you know, wash hands  right in the bathroom.  No.  Fuck!  Huh?  Damn.  No.  Fuck!  What?  You son of a bitch.  You got us again.  What?  You didn't know? 
[01:04:30]  No, I didn't know!  Seinfeld.  Oh, you guys.  What a dick.  That was Poppy.  You're getting way better.  See, Jerry went into the, Jerry went into the bathroom and Poppy came in and goes, Jerry,  I'm going to make you something very special.  And he came out of a dumper.  And, uh, and Jerry's washing his hands and, and they did it so well.  Cause you know, he like took a shit or something in there and he just looks in the mirror, adjusts  his collar, runs his hands through his hair and then walks out. 
[01:05:00]  And Jerry's horrified.  He's horrified.  You're getting way better at this, man.  Wow, I didn't know that.  Poppy's getting a little sloppy.  Poppy's a little sloppy.  All right, everyone.  We're back. 
[01:05:30]  It's blown out his nose.  Uh, let's see.  Wow.  Is he in that car or is that?  There's someone in there, yeah.  What happened?  209 mile an hour.  Wipeout.  Oh my God.  There's your video of the day.  What's the details of that?  Speed tester crashes car at 209 miles an hour.  Yeah, he's driving pretty goddamn fast.  You're welcome.  The only video I saw of it, uh, it was that. 
[01:06:00]  And then they showed it come to a stop and you did see some movement in there.  So.  Is he alive?  I guess so.  That thing, it started getting a little squirrely on him.  It went sideways.  Right.  And then it gets lifted up into the air a little bit and it's so, like, smooth and graceful.  And then it hits the ground.  That's it.  It can't spin any faster than it was spinning.  So, uh, A-Rod.  A-Rod.  A-Rod.  A-Rod.  A-Rod.  I'm actually agreeing with mine completely. 
[01:06:30]  I hate Bud Seelig.  Bud Seelig is actually making people sympathetic toward A-Rod, which is an impossibility.  People hate him.  Yeah, mostly they hate him.  Bud Seelig is a complete cunt.  But, uh, A-Rod's right.  He is being singled out.  Well, they're doing some arbitration hearings and, uh, uh, A-Rod finds out that Bud Seelig  is not in New York and will not be testifying.  So, A-Rod's like, fuck this shit.  Mm-hmm.  You better testify.  And he walks out and then he goes right to Mike Francesa. 
[01:07:00]  What a big get for Mike Francesa yesterday.  And then he, he was all emotional on Mike's show yesterday.  Angry.  Almost crying at times.  Do you think Mike Francesa's version of Roland came in and said,  You, you want A-Rod?  Yeah.  You want A-Rod?  He's gonna, he wants to, come on.  So, we got just a couple highlights from A-Rod on Mike Francesa's show.  He called a surprise call, right?  He just called in.  Call.  He walked in the studio.  Oh, he's in the studio.  He said, fuck this. 
[01:07:30]  Get me to the goddamn fan.  He walked right out and went right on, uh, the fan with Mike Francesa.  Did Mike put him on or did he make him wait?  Made him wait.  Wait, I'm, I'm, I'm busy.  He was busy, uh, dealing with prank calls.  And make him believe they don't get to him.  I spilt my Diet Coke.  I'm gay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, A-Rod.  He explains walking out of his hearing.  Uh, A-Rod, tell me what happened today.  Well, we got a ruling that, uh, the commissioner does not have to come in from Milwaukee.  And, uh, it, it was very disappointing. 
[01:08:00]  Obviously, I've been there for 10 or 12 days, whatever's been.  Uh, been there for every pitch.  Uh, you know, I have my, my girls back home in Miami.  And, you know, it's been difficult.  But, uh, you know, respecting the process, having been offered to, to come in a million shows,  haven't done anything.  And it's just been really just taking it one day at a time and respecting the process.  And today, I just, it, I lost my mind.  Wow.  What?  He lost his mind.  They're kind of singling him out. 
[01:08:30]  I mean, let's be honest here.  I'm starting to really feel, oh, he's not a great guy.  I mean.  But you got to ask yourself, why are they singling him out?  Well, it could be personal reasons.  They probably feel like he got away with murder.  But who didn't in baseball at that point?  But he hasn't really, uh.  There's all these people that were fucking doing the steroids and fucking jacking balls  over the goddamn walls.  But he hasn't really paid for it yet.  Baseball's just so real.  So they're really making him, making it hurt.  Florentine raised a point about fucking, uh, the home run record with Hank Aaron and Bud 
[01:09:00]  Seelig.  And there might be something to that too.  He just hates A-Rod.  But he's a fucking, Bud Seelig never should be commissioner.  He's an owner.  He should not be the commissioner.  He wasn't.  Oh, that's true.  Well, baseball made that mistake so long ago at this point, right?  I banged a table and kicked a briefcase and slammed out of the room and just felt like  this system, I knew it was restricted and I knew, uh, it wasn't fair.  But what we saw today is just, uh, it was disgusting.  And the fact that, uh, the man from Milwaukee that, uh, put the suspension on me with, with 
[01:09:30]  not one bit of evidence, something I didn't do and he doesn't have the courage to come  look at me in the eye and tell me, look, this is why I did 2-11.  I shouldn't serve one inning and this guy should come to my, to our city.  I know he doesn't like New York.  I love this city.  I love being a Yankee.  My daughters grew up in New York and for this guy, the embarrassment that he's put me and  my family through and he doesn't have the courage to come see me and tell me, 
[01:10:00]  this is why I'm going to destroy your career.  And I have to explain this to my daughter every day.  The thing that he's saying though, he did do something, but what is he saying about the  guy about, he didn't do anything and he shouldn't serve.  Why is he saying he shouldn't serve one inning?  Like what am I, I'm obviously missing something.  He's basically saying it's all bullshit.  The charges are bullshit.  Did he juice though?  I think he did, didn't he?  And Bud Selig is probably saying this is an open and shut case. 
[01:10:30]  I, I don't need to waste my time in New York.  They'll take care of it for, but that's probably what's going on.  Why wouldn't Bud show up?  Bud Selig is an absolute cunt.  I don't like him at all, but he probably has someone representing his side.  Obviously he's not worth his fucking time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, cause they think it's a no brainer.  Hmm.  Well, that's true.  Scumbag move though.  Well, A-Rod's using it to deflect obviously.  It is true.  You want to fucking get a little deflection here.  End somebody's career. 
[01:11:00]  Uh, you know, maybe you should show up.  It's the first time I've ever liked, right now is the first moment I've ever liked Alex  Rodriguez.  He's having a, what they call a human moment.  Yeah.  It's the first time I've ever liked.  This is why you don't always listen to people who tell you, don't go out and talk about it.  Cause then you tell your side and don't let the daily news do it for you.  You, you, you tell it.  You'll be back hating him soon enough.  Look, dude, he goes one for 17 in the fucking playoffs.  I'll hate him again.  But I don't want to see his career ended on, on a fun, because of Bud Selig. 
[01:11:30]  Cause Bud is not going to let this just sit there.  So he's going to explain some shit and you're going to go, oh fuck.  Okay.  They'll be like, oh yeah, fuck that A-Rod guy.  I betcha.  That's what's going to happen.  There's going to be a quick turnaround on this.  Another highlight.  So you blew up when the arbitrator Horowitz made the ruling, the commissioner is not coming.  That's when you exploded.  So you got the definitive word that he was not coming to this process, right?  I exploded much worse than Paul O'Neill on any of his explosions with the coolers.  I was very upset. 
[01:12:00]  I probably overreacted, but that's just, it came from the heart.  And this has been a very difficult process.  And I felt that the reason why I didn't go to Letterman or Leno or I didn't come on your show or the hundreds of invitations is out of the respect to the game, to Michael Wiener and to Manfred and also to the commissioner.  Wait, what was he saying?  Do you believe that?  He knows if he did any interviews, he'd be in a tough spot.  Out of respect, he didn't do interviews?  Come on. 
[01:12:30]  That's bullshit.  Well, he's just, he's basically saying, look, I could have been a dick before.  He can't say it like that, but he's basically saying, I could have been a dick a long time ago and blabbed, and I didn't.  But he also knows he would have been in a tough spot.  Yeah, I think he did at one point, right?  Didn't he do steroids at one point, but so many other guys did, too?  But he didn't blow off, you know, interview requests because, out of respect for those people?  Right.  There's no fucking way.  I don't know why the government's involved or Congress.  Who gives a fuck?  If these guys want to do steroids, let them. 
[01:13:00]  I don't care.  Yeah, I like it.  It's not my business.  It makes the experience that much more amazing.  Let's say hi to Tony in New York.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Listen, Jimmy, you said that you didn't understand, you thought A-Rod did juice, and it did come out in, like, 2002 that he did take steroids.  But what's going on here with this situation is some clinic in Miami got turned over by the government,  and the owner of the clinic, who's basically a felon, baseball paid him, and they paid him in cash, so it's really, really shady, to testify against A-Rod. 
[01:13:30]  And A-Rod saying that this claim is bullshit.  Wait, baseball paid him in cash?  Yup, cash.  And that's what all these sports shows are talking about, and Francesco is really on A-Rod's side this whole time.  Oh, yeah.  A-Rod's a huge, baseball's a huge organization.  How are they paying this guy in cash just to take down A-Rod?  So that's really what's going on here. 
[01:14:00]  He's saying that this is bullshit.  Well, we'll find out, I guess.  I think both sides have a lot of bullshit going on, but, um, but I mean, you know, I don't think A-Rod.  I think baseball players in general get together and go, all right, what do you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where can we go?  What do you got?  I don't think A-Rod did anything that anyone else wasn't doing at the time.  They were all looking for an edge, because there's way too much at stake.  Massive salaries, massive fame. 
[01:14:30]  So you get together with the guys and go, all right, what do you got?  What's the new thing?  Are they going to detect it in a piss test?  Right?  He's never tested positive.  A-Rod's never had a positive test.  That's another thing that should be brought out here.  Okay.  And the guys that got brought down in this, um, with this clinic, uh, they, they served their suspensions quietly.  They just went and served them, uh, because this guy, of course, they, they know that they were involved in it.  A-Rod did have some interaction with this clinic, but I, I think that it's just the process of the way baseball went about just nailing A-Rod. 
[01:15:00]  And then they gave him about 111 games more suspension than anybody else that was involved in this, uh, scandal.  Yeah, why?  And Bud Selig doesn't have to explain why.  He's just an arrogant old cunt.  That's because of the smirk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The A-Rod smirk.  Think that's it?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You think Selig's jealous of the chicks A-Rod gets to bang?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:15:30]  More info.  I appreciate it.  Back to the clip.  To Michael Wiener and, and to Manfred and ultimately to the commissioner.  Funny, right?  Um, because this is the game that I love.  I spent 20 years in the big leagues.  I, I, I've worked my tail off.  And at the end of the day, I always said to you and other media members, I will tell my story.  Very busy time.  There was a platform and a forum, and I thought rightfully so, this should end with Selig on Thursday and me on Friday under oath.  Put your money where your mouth is.  So you were going to still testify?  Or we can go to Milwaukee and we can do it there.  But you look at Selig, I want to challenge you. 
[01:16:00]  I was going to fucking work in the mic like wrestlers.  Right.  You were there, I'm there.  Although, yeah, if one testified, they both testify under oath.  Yeah.  But Selig should have to explain himself.  I don't care if you're the commissioner.  Under oath, right.  If you're giving this guy, who literally is the only challenger for the home run record.  If you're giving him this suspension, you should have to explain it.  You should show up and show cause.  You remember that last phone call we just talked?  Yes.  Of course. 
[01:16:30]  Okay.  We've got a classic situation right here.  Yes.  Classic.  We've never heard this before.  The last caller was wrong.  Go ahead, Anthony.  That call was complete bullshit, man.  Of course.  No.  What he said was accurate, but the part that he's missing is that A-Rod also tried to pay  these guys off prior to Major League Baseball getting a hold of him.  Okay.  Do they have proof of that?  Do I have proof of it?  No, not you.  You.  But are they saying they have proof of that? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, they're saying they have proof of that.  But not only do they have proof of that, they have proof that he tried to intimidate the  other players that were underneath the investigation not to cooperate with Major League Baseball.  Right.  It's the crux of the whole investigation.  So, the reason why they're going after him so hard is because they have a whole bunch  of evidence that links him to basically trying to squash all evidence linked to this clinic.  Right.  And the fact is that this is not only the first time he's dealing with somebody in Miami. 
[01:17:30]  He also deals with this guy, Galea.  Hold on.  But, dude.  Was the paying the cash thing?  That's a big...  Baseball doesn't pay in cash.  Was that what it was?  But then A-Rod's trying to squash some old findings as well.  Yeah, he's also trying to pay in cash, Jimmy.  And I think...  Yeah, but he's not...  Oh, sorry.  This guy is a scumbag and he only wanted cash.  So, I mean...  It's kind of shady on both ends.  And could you add that Major League Baseball is going after him really hard because of the  smirk? 
[01:18:00]  Please.  Yeah.  Please.  I got a theory.  It's all about the smirk.  The A-Rod smirk has gotten him in some deep trouble.  You want me to believe A-Rod was doing steroids because C-League says so?  You bought that lie.  All I got is the positive test and my balls.  Funny where your mouth is.  So, you were going to still testify.  Or we can go to Milwaukee and we can do it there.  But you were going to still testify.  I was going on Friday 9th.  Okay.  And you were told today that now the commission... 
[01:18:30]  Here's the ruling.  Commission is not coming.  Yep.  No.  That's a big face.  It is.  And then in the post it says, by shifting blame to C-League, Team A-Rod hits a home run  in the court of public opinion.  Like, yeah, I was just changed but maybe I'm still wrong.  That's what I'm saying.  He's deflecting a little bit.  He's taking advantage of the fact that C-League isn't showing up.  Working for him.  Sympathy.  It's absolutely working for him.  But that's what I'm saying.  Something will come out where you go back to, oh, okay.  Oh, that's right.  I got confused for a second. 
[01:19:00]  You're like, oh, that's right.  He is an asshole.  It'll probably happen today.  Oh.  And you can call up tomorrow and say, okay, you guys were right.  Yeah.  And then one more clip from the interview with Mike Francesa on the fan here in New York.  You have said in the past, a lot of times, everywhere, that you would, when it was over, and you're  saying now it's over, you have been very guarded about what you said, okay?  Okay.  You had not said much about the process, or were you guilty or innocent. 
[01:19:30]  And Takapina and I had heard a couple times say it, so I'll ask you the question.  Were you guilty of any of these charges?  No.  And I should have said anything.  Did you do anything wrong?  No.  Wow.  Did you do any PEDs?  No.  Did you obstruct just anybody, any witnesses?  Did you do anything that they accused you of doing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  So you're guilty in your mind of nothing?  I feel like I should be there opening day.  Okay.  And that's what I'm working hard for.  Wow.  And let's get that on the record.  You said you did not do these PEDs that they are accusing you of doing. 
[01:20:00]  You're correct, Mike.  Okay.  Oh, God.  All right.  But you know he's not under oath right now.  But he has nothing to lose by saying all that.  Yeah.  There's nothing to lose.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  He feels like there's plausible deniability there, so he's going with it.  Fucking guy did PEDs.  Maybe.  Hey.  What?  PVDs, whatever the fuck is different.  What do you mean?  I ain't no PED.  No, it's different.  Let's say hi to Daniel from Jersey. 
[01:20:30]  What's up, Daniel?  I used to do PEDs as a kid.  Nice.  What's that?  PEDs.  That's great.  Hi, buddy.  Hi.  Hey.  Major League Baseball is coming down on ARI Park for two reasons.  The first reason, like you said, is obviously because of the smirk.  Thank you.  Finally.  There you go.  Thank you, sir.  That's all I got, my goofy bit.  Let's go with it.  And what else?  What else, sir?  Yeah, the second reason, he actually, they have evidence that he was actually trying to 
[01:21:00]  cover it up and destroy some of the evidence that they had on him.  As far as the suspension, though, it's actually set in their agreement with the Players Union  how many games people get suspended for for using steroids.  So it's like, first offense is 50 games, I think.  After that is 100 games.  So that's what all the other players got.  Okay.  Hold on.  I'm going to stop you for a second, because you're the second person saying that A-Rod  tried to cover up some old evidence.  Where's the proof of that? 
[01:21:30]  It's in the pudding.  I'm sure that if it goes to file something like that, then it'll come out.  I thought better of it.  Okay.  I should have, too.  All right.  All right.  So there's no proof, really.  I don't know.  I guess they're going to come out.  Yeah, I really don't know.  There might be.  There might not be.  But, you know, I assume that Major League Baseball is not going to spend all the money  on a lengthy, you know, possibly going to court on it if they didn't have something  to back it up. 
[01:22:00]  Otherwise, they're just throwing money down the drain.  Well, we'll see what happens today, because I don't think Major League Baseball is going  to sit tight on what A-Rod said yesterday.  And when he said that he never used steroids, if I remember correctly, back, I don't remember  how many years ago it was, but when they did, like, their baseline testing, where all the  results were anonymous, to see, you know, they made a deal with the union that, based  on the results of that test, you know, how they would implement future testing for steroids.  Yeah.  And I think that he was one of the people that actually tested positive. 
[01:22:30]  The results were supposed to be anonymous, but a couple years afterwards, they got leaked  out.  And he was one of the people that tested positive.  All right.  Even if he did back then, it's just enough already, because so much of this shit goes  on, and baseball fucking knows it.  They always knew it.  Right.  They always knew it.  They always knew it.  And then it kind of exploded on them.  They're more hateable to me, because they're not the ones who are fighting for a contract  every X amount of years or fighting for the record.  They're the overall company, and they know it's happening, and then they act like fucking  what? 
[01:23:00]  They had no qualms about steroids when fucking it brought baseball back from the popular fucking  hell it was in because of the strike.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  They knew.  They knew damn well.  They're so close to the game, obviously.  And they study stats.  And they saw Sop and McGuire.  And they see the players bulking up.  They're not dummies.  Yeah, they know.  You go to your local gym, and all of a sudden you see a guy all bulked up. 
[01:23:30]  Emilia, oh, okay.  He's cycling.  Yeah.  Cycling through some shit right now.  Yeah.  They knew.  Get the fuck out of here.  Like they're toasting each other as the balls are flying over the walls.  Right.  I agree with you that they knew what was going on, and they didn't really care.  But, you know, I should come clean.  Don't say I never did it when there was a test that you did test positive.  You know, just say, look, I did it.  It was before there were penalties in place for it.  Once they changed the rules and said it's not allowed, I stopped doing it. 
[01:24:00]  You know, come clean.  Don't try to cover up what you did.  I know a lot of people have, you know, sympathy for A-Rod today, but that guy's full of lies.  You watch the turnaround now within a day or two.  I'm not lying.  Thank you, sir.  What is the Players Association doing?  Is the union sticking by him, or what is their stake on him?  Maybe someone knows.  Yeah, I guess they are.  I mean, I guess they have to, right?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm not lying.  I don't care what Mr. Balutigan says.  You can call up and just talk about nothing that's pertinent. 
[01:24:30]  Hello, I want to talk about being called on the trip.  What?  We weren't even talking about it.  All right.  How you doing?  This is Alex Shooter Pop-A-Lop.  Whoa.  Who's that?  Yeah, I was shooting up all of your steroids, and my head got so big, it's like a balloon.  You know, we're going to have to get a little taste of Scott and Todd.  I know it's October's over.  I know. 
[01:25:00]  But it is always.  And Wheeze put in a request to go after a radio show in Rochester.  Terry Clifford?  No.  Consider it done, Wheeze.  No, no, no, no, no.  Fuck two to the sea.  Terry Clifford Day.  No, no, no.  I was so scared my last visit to Rochester that I was going to fucking run into that monster.  Yeah.  I'd be afraid to.  Exactly.  No.  She was in that Chris Angel trick.  She stepped on him.  He's got a show that's very, very deserving.  Yeah.  Very deserving.  Why?  And this show basically said recently that Brother Wheeze, who does a lot for people in general, 
[01:25:30]  took money from charities.  Why?  Did he?  No, of course not.  Oh, sorry.  So, you know, we might have to put this show on.  What show is it?  On the radar.  I don't know.  I think her name's Kim or something.  Kimberly.  I don't know the name of the show.  Kimberly.  You mean that great song?  Supposedly she's a real, you know.  What?  Let's see.  I would like to expose people for taking charity money. 
[01:26:00]  But you're exposing the kids that actually are getting money because they have the disease.  And you call them out like, he's taking money from this charity.  And he's got a lollipop in one hand.  And he goes, he coughs and he's screaming at him in front of a group.  But I didn't do nothing, mister.  Yes, you did, bum.  Shout at him.  Put him on the stand.  Take his medicine and step on it.  Bad boy.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  You're a bad boy.  Oh, gee, mister. 
[01:26:30]  Tony in Jersey says A-Rod's name is the only one that got leaked out.  So that's, he feels like he's been singled out by Major League Baseball, of course.  That should be inadmissible in any sense of the word.  Right.  If it leaked.  We're going to break this week's podcast, which we didn't promote yesterday.  The brand new podcast is up for you.  It's the best of Mike Tyson on our show.  Oh.  From his three or four appearances.  It was good.  So please go get the Opie and Anthony podcast.  And please spread the word about the Opie and Anthony podcast. 
[01:27:00]  We're trying to figure out if there's a business model there.  Hint, hint.  Nudge, nudge.  Did you hear the big Mike Tyson news?  What?  I don't know if I'm supposed to say it.  Oh, no.  But he's happy that my special is on Netflix tonight.  American Degenerate is now available on Netflix.  Oh, nice.  He can only hold it for a couple seconds.  And then I see his whole face start collapsing.  Yes, he starts, like, chuckling a little.  That's very cool, though.  American Degenerate now available on Netflix.  And I have tickets going on sale tomorrow for the Valentine's Day weekend, Atlantic City 
[01:27:30]  of the Borgata.  I'm doing it myself.  I'm in the music box.  So bring your girlfriend or your wife, and I will ruin your weekend.  Bring your box to the music box.  That's what you're going to be saying.  I got to say, I started with my Tyson book.  How do you like it?  Holy fuck.  Awesome, right?  Fuck.  Awesome.  I'm only 30 pages in, and I'm already thinking, okay, 700 pages is not enough.  Or 600, whatever it is.  And it's small font, right?  So every page is fucking packed.  But it doesn't...  I don't feel like I'm reading Tyson's actual words, by the way. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, you think a little help?  Well, of course.  All the celebrities get a little help.  It's common now, and it's fine.  He probably talked it out.  He probably talked it out.  He absolutely talked it out, but then it was cleaned up a bit.  But holy fuck, does he have a story to tell.  I'm on page 4-something, 480 or whatever, and it has not gotten boring.  Really?  Not even a little.  I never realized that drug addiction was such a big part of his career.  I didn't realize the drugs he was doing during the Lennox Lewis fight are fucking... 
[01:28:30]  After, like, oh my god, drugs fucking ruined this poor guy.  It starts...  A poor guy, but you know what I mean.  Yeah.  The forward, or whatever the fuck it's called, before the numbers start.  I hate that about books.  Because you feel like you're kicking ass and you haven't even gotten to one yet.  You haven't even gotten to one yet.  Is it the ones where the pages are labeled like, I, I, I, I, I...  That drives me nuts, because that's like, that's not, you know...  That doesn't, it doesn't count.  No.  It doesn't count at the end.  Count to the page count, right. 
[01:29:00]  But he starts with Desiree Washington?  Holy fuck, did he get railroaded.  Yeah.  It's so obvious.  And he's sticking by that.  Yeah.  And then it goes into his upbringing where he had a chance.  He had a relatively normal family life.  And then the mom lost her job and all that.  Then they had to go to Brownsville where it was just a completely different neighborhood.  Fucking Beirut.  And then he's robbing houses at 7, 8, 9, 10 years old. 
[01:29:30]  A gun.  With a gun?  I can't even imagine that.  Give me your money, motherfucker.  He's in a gang fight with a gun and he sees his brother, his older brother, going,  What the fuck are you doing about any other gang?  Really great.  Oh, shit.  Great story, man.  What does his older brother do?  I don't know.  I believe he's still alive.  There's a photo in the book of Mike and his older brother.  So I'm thinking he's still around.  I don't think we ever saw a picture of Mike Tyson's older brother.  It's in there.  Same parents or like same mom type of deal?  What do we got there?  I do not know.  Yeah.  Probably same mom.  I wonder if he has boxing skills or ever did. 
[01:30:00]  His brother.  You got to have some kind of that neighborhood, man.  What kind of fight?  Yeah.  Mike Tyson was not nice.  Even in the boxing world.  One of his tricks was, you know, the old Subway's in.  Yeah.  Remember when you could pull the windows down?  I forgot.  Because I'm reading it in the book.  You could pull the windows down and get a little air, even though you're going to get  shitty air.  So he would sit in a seat.  He would pull all the windows down.  And then like women or whoever the fuck would sit in the seats where he just was.  He'd get out of the train and on the platform, reach in and yank fucking chains. 
[01:30:30]  As the train started going.  As the trains are going.  You'd reach in and yank your chain off.  Yank fucking chains.  And then fuck, you know, you're on the train.  Where are you going?  Good gimmick.  And then he would wear the chains for just a day or two.  But he knew eventually they would rob him of the chains.  So then he would, you know, get a couple days out of it.  And then he would pass it on to somebody else to get some money for it.  The violence that this guy grew up with, man.  Like the fucking fact that everything he had was going to be beaten.  He would be beaten up and everything was taken.  And then he'd beat somebody up and take their shit. 
[01:31:00]  It was like this fucking, it was a very, very violent place.  Something.  So many stories.  And I think in the book he's only 10 at this point.  Wandering around, no supervision, wearing really nice clothes, hanging out with older,  you know, street guys.  Yeah.  Dealing with pigeons.  The boiling water story.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Anyway, I know, you know.  Even in that world, though, I think he comes from a really violent place.  I'm sure Sonny Liston didn't come from a great neighborhood of George Foreman. 
[01:31:30]  But he came from a violent fucking neighborhood, man.  And a violent behavior he exhibited.  I can't wait to get back to reading it.  It's so fucking great.  It got me off my stupid candy crush obsession.  Wow.  I'm so happy that I'm reading again.  It's hard to focus on reading because of the phones and stuff.  It's hard to just go like, whew, and slow down and just read.  And I'm so happy I'm doing that a little bit more.  I used to read a lot.  Yeah.  I hope I get back into it.  I'm making myself, too.  I'm making myself. 
[01:32:00]  Because Tyson's book is so good.  Dr. J's book was good.  Mike's is better, though.  Oh, that I won't.  Dr. J's had a, Mike had a different life than Mike.  Sorry, Dr. J.  Then I'd go with Tyson.  Yeah, you got to go with Tyson, but.  And then I'll find something else to read after that.  No, I would recommend Dr. J.  It was good, but Tyson's just fucking it.  Maybe some kind of romance novel.  I'm just trying to figure out what that is.  What?  Too happy people.  There's a plan for my life.  Double plane crash survivor opens up.  Was this guy in two plane crashes? 
[01:32:30]  God, that's got to be a little funny.  Yeah, I know.  Don't fly with him, right?  Oh, yeah, Jim.  Oh, yeah.  Good one.  That's got to.  That means, you know, we got to get rid of him.  Jeez.  He's the devil or something.  Don't fucking.  What is he, a basketball player?  I don't know what he is.  What is it?  What do we got?  He don't fly right.  What do we got with this shit?  Well, he has survived two plane crashes that killed his parents. 
[01:33:00]  Yikes.  His parents were killed twice in plane crashes?  Damn.  Wow.  Look at that.  I'm playing in a garage.  He's now speaking publicly for the first time about his recovery and his plans to play college basketball.  For who, though?  University of Michigan.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Two plane crashes.  I see the M hats out there.  Do you know the odds are so fair to be killed in one plane crash?  Shinko bat it.  Could you imagine having two plane crashes with the odds? 
[01:33:30]  Shinko bat it.  I'll call the show.  Shinko bat it.  All right.  We'll be back with a great audio clip from Sean Penn.  Oh, good.  I'm sure it's so great.  And a news reporter looking like an idiot.  Ooh.  You'll be there at this show.  On Sirius X.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show. 
[01:34:00]  You'll be there at this show.  It's really low in the background.  Wow.  What is that?  Shedded.  Oh, shit.  The group called Avatar.  Television.  Huh?  The group called Avatar.  Oh, my gosh.  Avatar.  I was on television. 
[01:34:30]  Shedded.  Quiet.  You're funny.  That was red-eye last night.  Unbelievably fun.  Was it?  It was Ann Coulter, Dean Cain.  I didn't know Amazon.  Oh, Dean Cain.  Who was Superman Dean Cain.  Really cool guy.  And, of course, Andy Levy.  And Greg was there to host.  And fuck, was it fun last night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good old Dean Cain.  He's a relatively conservative dude, huh?  I guess.  I mean, we always get so silly on that show. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I talk about it.  And very rarely do I.  It's like, you talk about the topic a little bit, but I just get ridiculous.  Yeah, you go, oh, that's the best thing.  It's just, there have been times Greg asked me, like, so Anthony, what do you think about  this, that, and all I'm thinking is how I could segue his question into what I want  to say anyway.  And that's what I usually do.  It's like, oh, yeah, I think I agree with that.  But also.  I agree with this.  I'm almost as comfortable on Red Eye as I was on Tough Crowd.  Like, it's a much different vibe. 
[01:35:30]  It's definitely.  It's a much different environment.  Yes.  But it's so complete.  And they love fucking Gutfeld.  He will run Fox because, you know, like O'Reilly now, he subs for, he's got the five.  That cocksucker's on every 20 minutes.  He's subbing for O'Reilly?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, good for Greg.  Gutfeld is a really.  Did not know that.  Yeah, because he's a relatively young.  Decent looking and very, very.  Talented guy.  But he's not irrational.  Like, you can talk to him if you're a liberal.  He's not a fucking get rid of gays.  He's not one of those guys. 
[01:36:00]  He's a very rational guy.  I like, I watch him on a five a lot.  And, yeah, he writes up his little segments about a topic of the day or week and stuff.  And it's really concise and funny.  And he's got a good view on things.  Like Greg.  I found myself watching Chris Matthews.  Oh, God.  Chris Matthews.  He's just too predictable.  Chris Matthews.  Well, I was watching because they played a JFK tape that's never been played before. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  Of him talking about the debate with Nixon.  Oh, yeah.  And the makeup controversy.  Ah.  There was a, there was a, I wanted to, well, there was controversy about the makeup and  that it was possibly done on purpose to fuck Richard Nixon.  Oh, really?  A bit of a conspiracy.  That's the word I was looking for.  Oh.  What do you mean?  But then it turned out that it's the same makeup guys used a lot. 
[01:37:00]  But some were saying that, you know, the makeup guy was in on saying, you know, this is how we're  going to fuck Richard Nixon in this debate because he's going against the handsome JFK  guy.  We're going to give him shitty makeup.  Hair pancake makeup.  Because it's been discussed many, many times over the years.  That's why, you know, Nixon lost that election because he looked like shit on TV.  And it was the first, what, debate, right?  Yeah.  It was black and white, too.  Like, what did he do with makeup?  Yeah, but he had sweat on his upper lip, his forehead.  I was sweating. 
[01:37:30]  And they said he looked really pale.  And that's when I said to myself, it's black and white.  How can you really tell that?  But I guess back then when all you saw was black and white TV, you probably were able  to tell that shit more than you would nowadays.  And they also said that Nixon was in the hospital for that leg infection for something  like three weeks.  I had shingles.  Was it shingles?  Always with the shingles.  I couldn't hear you.  Prior to the debate.  But do we have the video?  Because what you get to see, the audio's a little rough, but what you get to see is 
[01:38:00]  a JFK extremely relaxed.  And his speaking voice is very different than his public voice.  He's not, ah, schnotch.  No, he's very, like, mellow.  Yeah?  It was fascinating.  I've seen this tape years ago.  I get it.  I should have gave you guys a heads up that we were going to go here.  That's fine.  It was, like, released yesterday or the day before.  That's cool.  Um, oh, Chris, man.  Oh, they don't really, it's just not online somewhere? 
[01:38:30]  Hey!  It's Hardball with Chris Matthews!  My hair's a mess!  There it is.  If you don't turn that this way, I'm going to kiss you on the lips.  Well, tonight we have some newly discovered footage of Jack Kennedy talking candidly.  Exactly, right here.  Exactly, right here.  He wasn't aware that a camera was rolling about his first debate with Richard Nixon.  He wasn't aware the camera was just...  Four days after that debate.  Here's the back story.  That first presidential debate of 1960 was the first ever televised, and television gave Kennedy the clear edge.  More than 60 million people watched, and what they saw may have been more important than what they heard. 
[01:39:00]  Look at the sweat under his lip.  He was a contract from the hospital, pale with sweat on his chin and upper lip.  By comparison, Kennedy was cool and flushed with confidence, projecting the winning image that would take him to the White House.  Well, the story goes that Nixon relied on makeup that failed to hold up under the hot lights in the studio.  The newspapers had a field day with that story, and the Chicago Daily News, a Republican paper,  went so far as to suggest that Nixon's makeup had been intentionally sabotaged by a Democratic makeup artist. 
[01:39:30]  Well, that story, of course, turned out not to be true, but the makeup issue was as hotly debated as the debate itself.  And here, hardball producer Will Robby dug through the NBC News archive and discovered footage with sound of Jack Kennedy talking  while having his makeup done on camera just four days after that debate.  He was at his home in Hyannis, Massachusetts, preparing for an interview with David Brinkley and Chet Huntley of NBC News.  Sounds a little rough, but...  It's a rare glimpse, I'm sure, to tell you, behind the curtain of Jack Kennedy's lawfare persona.  While the audio is poor, you can make out that they're discussing the story about Nixon's makeup. 
[01:40:00]  Historian Michael...  Oh, boy. Oh, good one, Chris.  Historian Michael...  Historian Michael...  Historian Michael Beckham is here with me now.  And, Michael, you've seen this, and you agree this is a big deal.  Yeah, it's amazing, because, you know, Chris, number one, especially this week, if you think about being...  He has hair like JFK.  You and I maybe have not seen before of JFK.  Comfortable voice.  There could be anything like that, so... 
[01:40:30]  What gender are you, boys?  ...have a fine that, you know, at least you and I have not seen...  This is all fat, and you cut off your steak.  All fat.  Get to it.  I love it, because, like, the scene in Craigslist about the Alabama...  Play the video.  This is what I was saying to myself last night.  He doesn't think the cameras are right.  Chris, get to it.  All right.  Get to it.  Enough suspense.  Let's take a look at what we found here.  Right.  Right.  Listen to his voice, though.  That story about the Democratic make-up man, the Democratic make-up man, the Democratic...  Yeah.  I think he got a rangle about the news, there.  In a rangle now about the lighting, that was, uh... 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, we did make him up.  Yeah, no, man.  Yeah, well, why not?  Who was it, Len?  Do you know?  No, he has men who does that for him all the time.  Same color.  But why doesn't Chicago do any news have that?  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what I'm looking for.  I must say, all these newspapers that keep putting a knock now into the debate, I think  it's just, uh...  All right.  Uh, media rivalry, isn't it?  No, there's some of that.  The Democrat, I must say, I don't know what we'd do without television. 
[01:41:30]  I'd look at...  Well, it was a hell of a show, I thought.  Well, it was a hell of a show, I thought.  You guys see it with the subtitles.  You get a glimpse there, White.  Pretty wild, though, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, just to see him...  Like, whenever you see photos of him just relaxing at the beach house, it's really great  to see...  On my sailboat!  Yeah.  Clinton had a lot of great stories about him, just personal, his life, and it's...  But he's soft-spoken there, like, very confident, just, you know, just talking. 
[01:42:00]  Just a nice, normal guy, and what a terrible fucking anniversary.  It really is.  As much as I've teased it, and we've all mocked it, and, you know, the historical whatever,  it's a fucking horrible day tomorrow, man.  Tomorrow, yeah.  Terrible.  Tomorrow's the day.  But Oswald was a...  What a...  I'm so happy that cocksucker's dead.  Oh, man.  And never got to do a bunch of interviews.  I mean, the conspiracy shit would have been knocked out if he had lived, but fuck him.  I like...  Squashed by...  Jack Ruby's truly a hero.  Sirhan Sirhan.  Yeah.  Still alive.  Right. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Why would they, you know...  Why would they leave him alive?  Mind control fucking 40 years ago.  Mind control.  And it still works?  Ugh.  Obviously, he needs to be kept alive.  He should be killed.  Sirhan Sirhan should be killed 40 to this country.  Then it went over to Anderson Cooper, and he went long form with the JFK thing.  A lot of old, old news clips, but long form witnesses, and talking about how people saw  something on the grassy knoll, and ran that way, and, you know, the announcement by the  press secretary that... 
[01:43:00]  A press secretary that was, I guess, filling in, and how he had to make the announcement  in front of everyone.  I never saw that clip either.  Did we see that?  That was pretty amazing.  Sam, can we see that?  The press secretary, P-R-E-S-S, space.  Go to CNN.  Man, they might have that piece all bundled up nice for us today.  Hold on.  Let me say this.  The boss wants the press secretary clip.  Why don't you fucking find it and stop futzing around?  Looking at Phil Spector, Sylvia Brown.  Yeah, psychic Sylvia Brown's dead, I guess. 
[01:43:30]  Yep.  Fucking vulture.  You think?  Yes.  Some say she found missing kids.  All right.  Well, my apologies.  I don't think...  I don't think she did.  You're a man of conviction.  Yeah, whatevs.  Yeah.  I was never convicted.  All right.  Sam, will you just Google it?  That's all right.  I should have gave these guys the heads up.  No, you take 10 seconds, boss.  You should find it.  It was a lot of clips I haven't seen before, because they really just kind of went a little  deeper because of the 50th anniversary. 
[01:44:00]  Sure.  Did you see that Bruder clip?  Yeah, it's the famous one.  No.  Put to what?  You hear about that?  They put it together, like, really touched up every frame, put it together in kind of  a stability...  Yeah, yeah.  They stabilized the picture.  It's amazing, huh?  Yeah, absolutely.  It's pretty cool.  I think I've seen...  Oh, here we go.  Oh, there's a horrible version of it.  We'll do it again.  Go on, Matt.  Go on, Matt.  John F. Kennedy died at approximately 1 o'clock. 
[01:44:30]  You're kidding.  Central Standard Time.  We are.  Today, here in Dallas.  Oh, no.  He died.  Gunshot wound in the brain.  Slow it down.  Insane in the membrane.  Remember static?  I have no other details regarding the assassination of the president.  This is a horrible version of it.  Assistant Press Secretary.  Yeah, he was not the actual guy that day. 
[01:45:00]  Malcolm killed off.  I mean, he was the guy that day, but it wasn't his gig.  And what?  He fucked it up because he goes, I could do it again?  Did anyone else pick up on that in the beginning?  Yeah, you want another take?  Yeah, they were telling him to slow down.  Right.  So, that's a horrible version of it.  Wowie kazowie.  Anyway, 50 years tomorrow.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  That eternal flame is not so eternal.  Well, Sunday morning with that Charles Osgood.  Sunday morning.  They dedicated their whole show last Sunday to the JFK assassination. 
[01:45:30]  They went real deep.  It was a great hour and a half of TV.  And the eternal flame, that flame's gone out a million fucking times since.  I did not know that.  A million times.  They had major construction on it because they decided to go with a new design.  So, not so eternal.  I think they mean it figuratively.  I understand what they mean.  They were Bangles fans.  I really thought they figured out, you know, trying to figure out how to keep the actual  flame going even through construction. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But it was down and out for a while.  Yeah, it's kind of out.  There's actually pictures of it out.  Yeah.  I mean, what does it mean?  It's stupid.  The gas shut off.  Right.  It's not some fucking magic.  Like Criss Angel.  Yeah.  You know, Balloon Kennedy would have been good if they put him in the car.  He'd still be alive today.  Think of Oswald Shock looking through that scope.  Right.  He fucking makes the shot and then just sees Kennedy go. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  Just inflates.  And I guess your pal there, George Zimmerman.  What happened?  He, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think he picked the wrong girl to kind of shack up with, first of all.  Well, she was probably a hot one.  She was posturing for some kind of interview and maybe a payday, some are saying.  Oh, boy.  And they were trying to negotiate, you know, a price.  Geez.  Why would she do that if they're still, especially if they're still, like, you know, connected? 
[01:47:00]  She wants to get a little cash.  She wants her 15 minutes, right?  She wants her taste.  But she's saying that he put a gun in his mouth, threatened suicide.  He was hungry.  And you...  He's like...  He is a big fella.  Yeah.  And he was on the pills.  Yeah?  After the trial.  What kind of pills?  I don't know.  Anti-anxiety?  Who knows?  Maybe he did some Xanadu.  A little Xanny?  Xanny action.  Xanny the nanny? 
[01:47:30]  Yep.  As Susan Anthony used to call it?  Of course he was depressed.  Of course.  Yeah.  You got to figure, you know.  As a human being, going through that, you know, it worked out in his favor in the end.  But as a human being, that's got to fucking take its toll on you.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's going to be popping up in the news every so often.  I guess, what?  $9,000 bail.  Right.  Um, restraining order.  Right.  The usual shit you get with a domestic, uh.  For $9,000 bail on a gun charge, or does the gun charge total bullshit? 
[01:48:00]  I think it's, you know, it's all alleged.  But, um.  Did he lose his guns for now?  Uh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think he's allowed to have his guns.  They did.  Yeah.  It usually happens when you get a domestic violence charge and a restraining order.  They, uh, pull your guns away.  Wow.  He's going to pull an OJ.  You think?  Yeah.  He'll end up in jail for something.  Yeah.  Because he can't go out in public.  He's hated.  He's going to pull an OJ, meaning all he has to do is just, you know, behave or whatever.  But he's not going to be able to help himself. 
[01:48:30]  And he'll, something will happen and he'll be in jail for a few.  Yeah.  A few years.  Easy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think that, uh, him being, like, in danger of his life, being out, is a little overblown.  I think you're right.  I don't see as many, um, you know, black assassins out there doing away with people that are known  to be, uh, you know, either racist or have done, uh, bad things to people in the black  community.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  I think he'd be fine.  So says you.  A lot of talk.  People are a lot of talk.  Yeah, but there's always one who will walk up and break.  Yeah, that's true.  Definitely.  Only takes one aunt.  But, uh, you know.  Be right back.  Apparently you can just walk around the streets and get a big fist in the face.  I like that the, uh, knockout game thing is kind of coming to a forefront in the news.  People talking about it's the latest thing to talk about.  Knockout game.  Looks fun.  But I don't, it is what it is, but it's just fucking, the way they tiptoe around the language. 
[01:49:30]  It's like, just say what it is.  It is funny.  Bunch of black guys walking around just punching people in the face.  Okay, that's what it is.  Yeah.  It's a knockout game.  If I was black and I could punch, I would play it.  Would you, yeah.  In this hallway.  I'd play it with the fucking down the hall.  I'd go, I'd love to go play it now.  Knock people out.  Men, women, children.  Been knocking motherfuckers out all day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatevs.  Yeah.  Whatevs, Chip.  That's what I say. 
[01:50:00]  I'm just trying to, it's bugging the shit out of me.  I can't remember what I was just reciting over and over again.  Last night and this morning I woke up again.  It's something Jimmy was saying yesterday and I just, I was annoying myself with it.  Like, right, shut up.  Something I said, but I must have had great wisdom to it.  Oh, yes.  Probably something wise.  Wisdom, wit.  Was it shit about it?  Was it shit up?  Shit dip. 
[01:50:30]  It would have been.  Can I see the news reporter looking like an idiot?  Oh, God, is that great.  We love these.  Of course we do.  Who doesn't love watching a news reporter fucking...  I don't.  Sound like a moron.  I'd rather laugh with somebody.  And this will be on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, if it's not there already.  Yeah, this is terrific.  This was in Minneapolis and the news reporters are on an ice rink.  Okay.  Now, the news reporter can't skate, but she's marveling at the fact that the wind is just 
[01:51:00]  so subtly and slowly blowing her backwards.  And so she's just kind of skating backwards without moving.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Please tell me it blew her in front of the train.  And cold water.  Thin ice warnings are out, but you don't have to worry about that on the Oval.  The John Rose Minnesota Skating Oval is now open for its 20th season of outdoor skating.  Can't make a fucking look, right?  I don't know where.  I've seen Sam.  The ice is nice.  Good morning, Emma. 
[01:51:30]  We are here.  Okay, the wind is blowing such that I'm able to skate backwards with absolutely no effort.  What the hell?  Yeah, that'll happen.  It's actually kind of amazing.  There we go.  She's amazed by that.  This is actually really unbelievable.  I'm being blown.  It's unbelievable?  Really?  Okay.  She's like, oh, okay.  Face plant.  Right on her face.  But why can't she put her hands out?  What's wrong with her?  I don't know.  She's embraced her fall.  No, she lets her face take the entire run of the fall. 
[01:52:00]  Pretty much.  Okay.  I bet you they're very concerned after this.  Oh, yeah.  Does she have teeth missing?  That would be nice.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, her hands slip out.  Oh, that's what happened.  She put her hands down, but it's ice, so they slip to the side.  Oh, that's what happened?  Yeah.  But instead of bringing her head up and maybe bracing her chest for impact or something.  Face first.  Just face.  Chin.  Into the ice, yeah.  All right, let's go.  Nice.  Wow.  Ow. 
[01:52:30]  Okay, I'm okay.  I'm okay.  M.A.  M.A.  Are you all right?  Not really.  Not really.  Oh, God.  Is she bleeding?  Yeah.  No, I'm fine.  I don't think so.  I am fine.  Her mouth looks bloody.  A little bit.  She's bleeding.  She tried us one thing.  Oh, my God.  Is she bleeding?  It looked bloody.  Yeah, and why would you continue with the...  It's a real moment.  It's so phony.  All right, fuck this stupid story.  It was dumb anyway.  She should improv that said, my mouth, it looks like my pussy once a month.  It's bleeding. 
[01:53:00]  Put a tampon in my mouth.  Hey.  Shit.  Why would they go back to the story?  Yeah.  It's a bony here.  You just face-planted, you dummy.  Just go with the face-plant a little longer.  That's way better than a Zamboni story.  You can't really get past that point that you're fucking...  Sure.  You face-planted.  Right.  Let me say hi to Frank in the Bronx.  What's up?  Frank, what's better?  Frank-y.  Hello, Frankenstein.  How are you? 
[01:53:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, that's true.  You know what really sucks is the news is actually bringing the story of these knockouts to light,  and it's actually something now the white, the idiot white kids that want to be black  are starting to do.  Oh, good.  And it's, you know, it's really, it's really ridiculous, and the more they put it on the  news, and the more whatever they are, they're showing.  Hello?  Yeah, right here, buddy.  Oh, God.  Did your niece get...  Sorry, guys, sorry.  Was your niece part of this? 
[01:54:00]  She got, yeah, she got pummeled by a stupid, uh, a girl in the Bronx two days ago.  She's still in the hospital, but she's going to be all right.  They actually had to induce her a little bit because the brain was swelling, but...  Oh, wow.  I'm not going to be all right, but it's just sick.  It's just really sick.  She's 13 years old.  She weighs 100 pounds.  I mean, it's just sick.  Fatty.  Fatty.  Where was she when the girl did that?  Like, what was happening?  She was booked her first date with Anthony, probably, but no. 
[01:54:30]  I'm not sure.  She was walking home from school, and just a big, brute girl punched her in the head, and  she fell.  And it was really the fall that really hurt her head.  Yeah, that's what happens, because they're knocked out before they hit the fucking ground.  Ah, bunch of fucking assholes.  Just said, Opie, you better keep that kid in private classes.  You don't want to expose him to any of this fucking public school crap.  It's only going to cost you $90 million a year, but...  Well, with, um...  It's less than that. 
[01:55:00]  De Blasio doesn't like the fact that there are schools that cost money, and people that  want their kids to get a good education and not be around a savage element send their  children to those schools.  He doesn't like that, so he wants to tax rich people, so perhaps they can't afford that,  and then take that tax money and throw it at these public schools that, um...  That are fucking just...  ...are more problems than just money can take care of.  Sometimes, you can't just throw money at a problem.  It still won't go away.  Did you see De Blasio? 
[01:55:30]  They had some interview he did before the election where he was talking about the fact  that he's not a free market guy, and he's a heavy-hand government guy, and still...  You idiots in New York.  ...they just elected him because his son has a big afro.  And one more thing...  I'm sorry, guys.  One more thing about that whole De Blasio situation.  I'll discuss that later.  There's a guy named Ted that's opening up a DeVry School of Engineering. 
[01:56:00]  Is that going to happen, Ted?  Yeah, I got my...  Hold on a second.  I think I'm going to buy myself a bunch of emporiums or something.  Why is Chip doing Ted?  Chip's doing Ted.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You know what?  I have an emporium of just...  No.  ...a shinkle of Craig's conundrums.  Is that what you were doing, walking around saying Craig's conundrums?  Between shinkle and this collar.  You've had enough, haven't you?  I've had it.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Frank. 
[01:56:30]  Thank you.  All right, all right.  Hold to yourself.  You're panicking.  All right.  All right.  We got Sean Penn threatening to fucking have a fan eat his own phone.  What?  I guess Sean Penn was in a restaurant and, you know, see a celebrity in a restaurant, you  are going to try to take a picture.  Oh, yeah.  You sure are.  And, well, Sean, you know...  Was the guy being a dick?  ...gets really, really mad.  The video doesn't pick up until Sean starts confronting him.  Okay.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Probably being a dick.  I don't know how far away is it. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Hurry up, Sam.  Make it bigger.  I'll kill you.  Get the f*** out of here.  Oh, shit.  I'll make you eat the f***.  Get out of here.  All right.  Get out of here.  He sits back down.  I mean, that's pretty much the story.  Yeah.  They're making it...  I would say...  I would say...  They're making it way worse than it is.  I would say to him, I go, I don't hear you unless you knock.  Knock.  He doesn't even want to acknowledge you ever made that movie.  Just do Spicoli impressive film.  So many f***ing fans of Fast Times.  The guy was just probably being a dick and invasive with the phone and just yelled at him. 
[01:57:30]  Well, Sean Penn's a dick, too.  He can be, yeah.  It seems like he can be kind of a dicky.  Oh, he is an asshole.  What is a hobby saying?  Yeah.  Yelling in restaurants.  Is it wrong?  Or how about the voiceover guy?  Sean Penn's in a restaurant!  Not a fan of that.  I get mad at myself every time I click on a TMZ clip.  Should you eat phones?  I feel like I'm just contributing to...  Let's see what Harvey said.  You can just do any of his questions.  The question's always fun. 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  Sean Penn flips out on fan.  I'll make you eat your own cell phone.  Whose side are you on?  Sean's or the fans?  All questions.  I'm on the phone's side.  He has a worthless fucking Twitter.  Yeah.  I'll go to the next one.  It's all questions.  It's the best.  Horrendous.  Go ahead.  Bruce Jenner.  I'm proud of Kendall's boobs.  What do you think of the photo?  18.  She just fucking turned 18, and she's got her nips showing through this shirt. 
[01:58:30]  Yep.  Let me say it.  A see-through number.  Apparently, she couldn't get her tits out there quick enough.  Oh, yeah.  Right away.  She's not stupid.  Those are the money makers.  Yeah.  Those are lovely.  Of course they are.  I feel so bad for Kim Kardashian, because this broad is going to just wipe her off the  map.  This is going to be the next it girl, huh?  Oh, it's not even a...  It's...  When they're photographed together, Kim Kardashian looks like a fucking frump.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A complete frump.  Deep into her 30s now.  This chick's 18. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Right.  She's taller.  Yeah.  Doesn't have that ridiculous over-the-top ass.  Oh, that's what I happen to like about Kim Kardashian, Sam.  Kim Kardashian's ass is a maker.  Go show the latest picture of Kim Kardashian's ass when they're walking around New York City.  It's ridiculous.  Run a comb through that hair, though.  Look, it's all in her face.  Your face is so pretty.  Why do you put the hair in it like that?  Why do you hide it?  You look like the girl from The Ring.  What are you getting out of a well and crawling through the television?  Why don't you go do your homework and cover yourself? 
[01:59:30]  That girl turned out pretty hot.  That girl that played The Ring Girl.  The Ring Girl, yeah.  She did, right?  Yeah, it fucked up.  Why is Bruce Jenner commenting about his daughter's tits?  Why not?  He probably said he's proud of the picture or I'm proud of everything.  Oh, no.  He said, I love sucking on my daughter's tits.  Oh, you see that?  That's crazy.  Why would he do that?  Yes.  His burn victim wig.  Hairdo.  Face.  He said he's proud of her no matter what she does.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, and then they...  He's proud of her boobs.  And then they spun it?  What assholes.  Go back to Harvey and his questions. 
[02:00:00]  Harvey, should I say, I'm a cunt, right or wrong?  Oh, this is good.  Oh, another question.  CeeLo's lawyer calls BS on judge over courtroom camera.  Yeah.  Do you think the judge's decision is unfair?  I don't know.  I don't know the law.  Who knows?  It's not going to start a Twitter buzz with yourself.  Fucking shithead.  People's court shithead.  God, I don't know.  He is a moron.  Any other...  Yeah.  White House to curb Hollywood screenings.  After Mandela, that's it. 
[02:00:30]  Do you agree with the decision?  I'm so happy I don't ever go to TMZ.  Yeah.  No, actually, I don't agree, because I always thought I'd someday go watch a screening at  the White House.  You're not getting invited!  Oh, shit.  Miley Cyrus bleached her eyebrows.  That's what they're calling it.  What do you think of her new look?  It was dumb.  Oh, yeah?  Where's the pic?  Oh, you actually...  I want to see her bleached eyebrows, because I hear it looks like she doesn't have eyebrows 
[02:01:00]  anymore.  Yeah, look.  She looks like a monster.  What is she doing?  I hope her breath is good.  I want to put my cock right where that tongue is, and then just pull it back out and reinsert  it.  Oh, Sam, put your tongue back in.  Why did you do that?  I don't know.  It's a weird face.  What's wrong with her?  Her eyebrows look...  She looks like a mutant.  Sorry.  Did you see the fucking...  Someone sent me this link.  16 horses that look like Miley Cyrus.  Oh, wow.  Can you find that?  Is this funny?  Horses do that thing where they stick their tongue out at the side. 
[02:01:30]  Dude, it's really funny.  Yeah, my fucking...  Oh, that's great.  A friend of mine sent me that.  It was...  Oh, man.  There it is.  From BuzzFeed.  Okay, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Now we just laugh for 30 seconds.  Oh, horses.  Without explaining.  I love horses.  Look at that one.  They're adorable.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Yeah, they all look like her in some way.  A little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  And horses can look evil if they want to. 
[02:02:00]  Holy fuck.  It's funny.  I don't want to fuck the horse, though, like I do Miley in every shot.  Horses can be very nasty.  They put their ears back, and they, like, open their mouth, and they come at you with  those big teeth sometimes trying to bite you.  Do they get nipped?  Oh, yeah.  That hurts?  Yeah.  Could they fuck you up?  Yeah, they don't usually, but...  They can fuck you up.  They can...  Wait, they put their ears back when they're mad?  Yeah, they put their ears flat back, and their neck goes down, and their head goes straight.  They're like a fucking torpedo.  Wow.  And they come at you with those goddamn teeth. 
[02:02:30]  Fuck that.  How about mad horse?  Can we look at a mad horse?  I guess.  When they make sounds like that, they go...  That's what happens when they feel Ant's hands on their hips.  Yes.  And they know what time it is.  They know what's coming.  Angry horse.  I've never seen that.  I'd get right behind him and kick his ass.  That horse is pissed.  It's eating oats out of a bucket, and another horse is coming by him.  His ears are back.  Yeah, he's very mad.  They do that to protect their ears.  Of course.  So the other horses can bite him off.  And then I want their iPod's knocked out. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  They're always wearing a little horse iPod.  Uh-oh.  What?  He's sharing.  God, we edited your video.  Horses aren't very good at sharing.  Jesus.  Horses don't like sharing.  The one horse is just eating, and the other horse is kind of nosing over the fucking edge.  He's not very angry, though.  No, he's just eating.  Let's see.  He doesn't want to share his oats.  I want to put my hand right in there and pinch his nose.  Oh, yeah.  How much longer?  It's a six-hour video. 
[02:03:30]  Ten seconds.  He's wearing a coat.  He's not.  He's barely angry.  Oh, God.  Oh, come on.  This should say mildly perturbed horse.  Of course.  Sam, you found the wrong video.  That's nothing.  Oh, he's not that angry.  Oh, boy.  That's it.  Come on.  Find that fucking angry horse.  He was never really angry.  Sam, really pit.  One angry stallion.  One angry stallion.  Sounds like a dinosaur.  This could be me.  Oh, this could be good.  Oh, this is probably what I was talking about when he makes that sound.  They make that sound.  I know.  So, another guy that needs to edit his fucking video. 
[02:04:00]  Finally.  Oh, my God.  It does sound like T-Rex.  Yeah.  He has chip teeth.  What's up?  Fucking horse.  You need your friend.  It's not that angry.  No, he's not.  He's making...  Oh, my God.  This...  Who...  Was it one guy making angry horse videos?  Oh.  That's his specialty.  Angry horse bit is a fucking bust.  I know.  Right?  Oh, my God.  It's just running around in circles. 
[02:04:30]  That's not angry, is it?  No.  He sounds like he's kind of excited about something.  He's waiting for the old Lone Ranger to come.  Yeah.  Fuck his mouth.  His dick's hanging out.  He's probably fucking...  I saw that thing swinging around.  Oh, really?  Swinging horse cock.  Yeah.  Look at that thing.  Oh, it went back in.  That's his balls.  I want to tickle them.  His dick was out a minute ago, for sure.  Oh, what ads?  Enough of the not angry horse.  I know.  Oh, God.  That's that.  This is on happyhorse.com now.  Oh, well.  Ah, it's terrible.  Let's cut our losses. 
[02:05:00]  Unless you got one in the millions.  No.  That usually...  As a sign, it's a good video.  Yeah, Sam failed miserably.  I can't believe I couldn't pull off the  let's look at angry horses on YouTube bit.  You know what?  Well, I want to be here to sound in it.  A lot of people can.  Yeah.  Angry horse on YouTube bit would have been a whole podcast.  Could be.  Could very well be.  Did you read the article?  Did you hear about the article that the guy who wrote  Sarah Silverman is...  She shouldn't be trying to...  Yeah, the guy of Variety.  ...get dirty like the guys do? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, he was like, ah, Sarah Silverman should have kept,  you know, like she was doing.  Instead of trying to get so rude and angry like...  She's only been kind of rude and itchy and dirty.  What jerk off said that?  Some writer for Variety.  Oh, fucking Variety, who cares?  Variety.  It's the spice of life, Jim.  Someone tweeted that her diva song is really funny.  Have you heard that yet?  Yeah, I don't know.  It was Brian Laurie.  Brian Laurie.  Are we throwing the ball around right now?  Is that what we're doing?  A little bit. 
[02:06:00]  I think we're throwing the ball around.  A little bit.  It happens.  But why would he...  I'm not saying that we're not guilty of it.  I hear you.  But we keep it to a minimum.  We try.  I don't like the morning mash-up style.  And he's written the same thing about Schumer.  Amy?  Yeah, of course.  I guess he expects female comics to be a certain demure way.  What a fucking cunt this guy is.  I don't like when they vote or smoke either.  Bad move for the ladies.  You're a good comic.  You're a good comic.  And she's a fucking good comic.  Who cares?  Sarah Silverman, bad career move. 
[02:06:30]  Ooh.  Being as dirty as the guys.  Yeah.  She's always been that person.  Always.  What is he talking about?  Three million Twitter followers.  She's doing terrible.  What an asshole this guy is.  Despite all manner of career-friendly gifts,  from her looks to solid acting chops,  she's limited herself by appearing determined  to prove she can be as dirty and distasteful as the boys.  Let me rephrase that.  Because she is good-looking and is a good actress, 
[02:07:00]  she has been lucky that she hasn't had to sell out  and become the fucking clean comic  that shitheads like variety crave.  Is that what he wrote?  That's kind of what he should have written.  I gotcha.  Because she's doing what she does,  what makes her who she is.  She's always fucking been that way.  I love when she talks about ass sex  and her baby voice.  Me too.  I just about had it with her.  Sorry.  I love her.  You don't like Sarah Silverman?  I'd fuck her, but...  She's funny, man.  All right, well, there goes the idea of 
[02:07:30]  Brian Lowry being misogynist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd fuck her.  I don't know, sometimes people's political ideology  does fuck up my whole thing of  if I like them or not.  Really?  Professionally.  Yeah.  Yeah, if they're way too fucking...  I never care.  I swear to you,  as long as it doesn't...  As long as I can still...  If it's part of what they're doing, 
[02:08:00]  like their act or something,  and even if they sincerely mean it,  and it's funny,  I don't mind that.  That's great.  But when they start preaching...  I don't know.  I, for some reason, don't care on either...  Like, Dennis Miller apparently has gotten  really political...  But, I mean, that doesn't bother me.  I still like Dennis.  I mean, I don't care.  Oh.  It makes the bar on Tatooine  look like the Algonquin Round Table.  Fucking... 
[02:08:30]  We get it.  Every fuck...  For years, him with those dumb quotes.  Kind of...  Pretty plus more on the Twitter.  Cyclist gets bitten by a horse in the mountains.  Oh, yeah?  He's mountain biking in the...  Shit.  In the mountains, obviously,  and then there's wild horses,  so he decides,  I'm going to pet one of these fuckers.  Damn.  I guess they could drag him away.  I'm trying to save the angry horse bit.  Oh.  I'm trying to save it.  You are.  You're fucking...  I don't want too many fucking fails on the show.  You're fucking chest pumping. 
[02:09:00]  Come on!  Here we go.  Is that a pony?  Nah, I think the video's fucked up.  I don't know why they had to add the music, but...  I bit his arm, you dummy.  Pretty good, too.  Right below the wrist, really hard.  Nice chomp.  It just snipped him, though.  Yeah.  Nice chomp.  I don't know why they needed the music.  I think they decided they were going to put funny, happy music to it.  Oh, they picked the wrong funny, happy music.  They saw some wild horses.  Yeah, let's stop and look.  Wouldn't drag me away. 
[02:09:30]  What's he saying?  Putting some Gatorade on it.  Is it still music, Sam?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, it's just music.  And can we see that again?  That great bite?  That fucking thing just...  But the thing didn't...  That was a good chomp.  ...got rid of him.  That was a warning bite.  Like, get the fuck away from me.  They're wild horses.  And it warned him right at first.  Oh, wow.  That fucking thing puts his ears back and starts throwing his head at the bicycle guy.  And the bicycle guy puts his arm out to the horse.  What are you, stupid?  He probably thinks the horse...  Go back, Sam.  You should have backed away right then and there.  He probably thinks the horse is naughty at him. 
[02:10:00]  Like, what's up?  Yeah, yeah.  Look, it sees him coming up.  It's eating.  Puts his ears back.  Look, look.  And it's on his head.  Oh, God, good.  Would you know that?  Big horse.  Fuck yeah.  Like any animal, when they put their ears back, it's usually a sign of, don't fuck with  that thing.  I mean, if you just go to my video on Instagram that I put up of little fucking poor Beavis,  he's biting me.  And his ears are back.  Oh, you're raising a killer.  You know that.  I know. 
[02:10:30]  It's terrible.  It didn't break the skin and it didn't fuck with him.  It's pretty red on the one side.  You saw that?  That thing could have hurt him.  That was a get the fuck away.  That was a warning bite.  Don't fuck with me.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Go pedal somewhere else.  Go pedal your wares somewhere else.  That's right.  I say.  Good for the horse.  I always gotta like when an animal gets one in on dumb people.  It's always fun.  I love that when a deer fucking goes after a hunter because he put fucking deer vagina 
[02:11:00]  piss all over himself to try to get the deer to come close to him and then just starts  fucking him or kicking him.  Probably not a popular view, but I'm having a rough time with that lion picture with that  broad.  What do you mean not a popular view?  What do you mean?  Michelle, what was her fucking name?  Are you for her?  What?  Why are you for her?  That's not the popular view.  Oh, we blasted her.  Oh, good.  Oh, you weren't here that day.  Oh, we fucking killed her that day.  Oh, good.  Fuck her.  I don't know. 
[02:11:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I hope she...  To show it off like a trophy like that is...  Yeah, yeah.  And I know it's not popular.  We got a lot of hunters out there that have no problem with it.  No, more people were definitely against what she was doing.  But that fucking animal looked beautiful.  She's a pig.  She's a fucking pig and I hope she's mauled.  And she's pretty much putting her thumbs up like, look at her.  Oh.  I wasn't impressed by that.  What kind of hunting was it anyway?  Somewhere in Africa.  But was it some of that closed-in hunting or was it out in the open?  I don't know.  People have told me... 
[02:12:00]  Well, people have emailed me with this.  You know, the money that she spends on that hunt, that goes to help preserve it.  I don't give a fuck.  She's a cunt.  And I hope that eventually her arm is ripped off.  She does a hunting show, I guess?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're saying she spent $30,000 to go over there and hunt this lion.  And that money goes into the local economy.  It goes to help the wild game preserves and actually saves animals.  And Jimmy had a great analogy on his show.  He said, well, that's like paying money to rape a woman. 
[02:12:30]  And then the money goes to rape crisis center.  It still doesn't help the fact that you raped a woman.  It's just disgusting and it's an excuse.  How about this, pig?  Take that $30,000 or take $20,000 of it and just donate it to fucking animal preserves.  Instead of having to get your fucking rotten pussy wet by murdering an animal.  Shooting it.  Oh, I'm glad you guys talked about it.  That picture really bothers me.  It makes me, I literally, I said this and I wasn't kidding.  I hope her tits are ripped off by an animal. 
[02:13:00]  I hope an animal claws her tits and ruins them.  Oh.  Fuck her, man.  Going out and doing that for, and again, hunters, we've talked about this.  I don't hate people that hunt for their own food.  I actually admire them.  Because they're doing something I can't do or I won't do.  So if you go out there and you shoot a deer and you eat it and you don't want the government  fucking with your food and all that nonsense and you trust yourself and you can make that  food, I really do respect that.  And they've made the argument that they're controlling the deer population because a lot 
[02:13:30]  of them would just starve to death.  Yeah.  That's a little bit different.  Fuck deer.  It's not a regal animal.  But the point is, though, the deer is a different thing.  It's stupid face.  At this point, there's not many lions left in the wild, too, right?  But I was thinking, it's like, it's not this overabundant.  I think that number is pretty bad right now.  It is.  Which makes it a little worse, too, I think.  There's always these big animals.  And one day, I hope one of them gets, I hope her gun misfires and either A goes off and  blows half her face off.  Ow.  And then she's scarred. 
[02:14:00]  And then we'll see about her fucking TV show that she wants to whore herself out for.  Or I just hope, and I said this the other day, I hope an elephant steps on her cunt and  she lives.  Oh, man.  I hope it just steps on it and blows her feet off.  When you were describing how her flat cunt.  Oh, did I?  So then she has, yeah.  Well, you didn't describe her.  You just said an elephant steps on her cunt.  So she has a flat cunt.  Big elephant foot shape.  I despise that woman.  Okay, good.  No, she's not a popular woman there. 
[02:14:30]  A lot of people were.  People got very mad at me, though, for that.  I got a lot of hate mail about that.  Of course.  I don't care.  I would assume you would.  It doesn't matter what side you take.  It was the grandstanding more than anything.  But the dead animal and her really just.  We played the video of her, and she can barely talk.  What'd she do in the video?  She's talking about how her whole life is about hunting.  That's why I took the shot.  Yeah, congratulating herself for all the time she put in.  She's so self-congratulatory.  These coyotes chase the deer towards her and fucking miss. 
[02:15:00]  I bite my tongue every time I talk, is so proud of herself that she shot this deer that  the coyotes chase towards her.  Yeah.  She's a fucking valueless person.  And I wish nothing but agony on her for that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't even want to see the videos.  Do we have the pictures?  Well, they don't really show videos of her killing anything.  I know.  Hunting videos are weird.  Hunting videos are weird.  They rarely show any real.  I mean, they're out there, believe me. 
[02:15:30]  But like the TV shows and stuff, they never really show the kill.  No, because they know it bothers people in the end.  Oh, she's a big bear.  Big, beautiful bear.  Why?  For what?  Oh, with Melissa Bachman.  Yeah.  Rock.  It's Thursday.  That's tits.  She's having good looking.  She's got big tits.  Today, we're going over ground bites.  Now, I absolutely love everything out of our eyes.  Ground bites.  One of the most important things to first look at when you're picking out a ground bite 
[02:16:00]  are the window.  What's wrong with her voice?  Exactly.  Exactly, yeah.  You want to make sure you just wrap all the way around because, let's face it, turkeys  and deer, they don't always come in the one spot you want.  And with this blind, you also get a few alternative windows.  Give the fuck.  Gotta hide and dress like the environment.  What a fucking asshole, bitch.  You don't like the fact that she's hiding?  I've never wanted...  I wish that fucking animals out there had the same wherewithal as whales and they could  fucking flank this cunt and then just crush her. 
[02:16:30]  But hiding is part of the whole hunting experience.  You'd respect them if they just walked out there?  Yeah.  Or, again, if she was doing it to eat it.  I don't have much more respect.  Eat it.  Without camouflage.  Yeah.  That Trace Adkins better get his ass in here or we're going back to Team Penn.  Where is he?  Penn Jillette.  He's right across the street.  He's singing Christmas songs over there.  He should be singing a song for us today.  What happened with that?  Say a prayer for peace. 
[02:17:00]  I fucking can't stand country music.  I just can't.  Especially when they try to cross over country Christmas.  Hold on.  Let's go to Tommy in Brooklyn.  Oh, Tannenbaum.  Oh, Tannenbaum.  You sound like a Jew.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Tommy.  How are you?  Trying to talk like how Trace Adkins sings. 
[02:17:30]  Trace Adkins.  What do you got, Tommy?  I'm just wondering if you guys got the back story on that.  I had a friend who was an African thing.  And he shot a line.  But it was a nuisance line.  It had gone into a village.  He was pinching people.  Come up, sneak up behind him and pinch them.  Can I ask?  Okay, go ahead.  Bye.  Sorry.  I'm wondering if that's, you know, what happened.  But let me ask you a question.  Maybe you're correct.  They said that the elephant, that scumbag who runs GoDaddy shot another guy I wish would 
[02:18:00]  be trampled to death.  So the Africans who lived there for fucking hundreds of thousands of years need fucking  white people to come in with their guns and take care of their local animal problems?  Or do they just figure out a way to get some money so people can get their guns?  They're fucking bloodlust and go over there and kill something bigger than them.  That's all that is.  They figured out how to sleep better at night.  That's exactly it.  They don't give a fuck that it feeds the village.  But they're like, oh, wait.  Okay. 
[02:18:30]  I'm going to go with this angle.  It's 20 fucking 13.  There shouldn't be villages.  If they care about the Africans, why don't they go over there with condoms or something?  You know what I mean?  It's bullshit.  They all be said.  They want to sleep better at night.  The guy from GoDaddy doesn't want to just realize he's a big corporate bag of shit.  And, you know.  And someone probably had to tell him that.  They're like, look, you know.  You'll feel better about yourself because the villagers will take the meat away.  We do give them condoms.  And, by the way, you know what they do with them?  They spend time tying them up in knots and winding them around each other. 
[02:19:00]  And they do it over and over and over again with hundreds and hundreds of condoms to make soccer balls out of them.  All right.  So they can play soccer.  Put it on, you dick!  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stop having fucking 18,000 more kids.  Well, where are they going to get a soccer ball?  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  But plus, if they're playing soccer, they're not fucking.  So I guess it comes out.  Well, that's true.  Maybe they're too tired to fuck after the game of soccer.  Is that really how they make a soccer ball?  Yeah.  That sounds kind of cool.  That thing must...  You could probably kick that a mile. 
[02:19:30]  How about instead of playing soccer, you figure out how to keep the sewage away from your water supply?  Huh?  Work that out.  Work that out.  Why?  Well, because it's 20-fucking-14, just about.  And the other day, I step outside my house and I watch the rocket ship go crawling into the sky.  I thought you couldn't see it.  I saw a little dot.  I couldn't see it.  I tried.  I went out.  Too much city lights.  I thought I'd see a little more.  I didn't see shit.  It was supposedly a big deal.  So, hold on. 
[02:20:00]  Someone's saying we're...  I know.  I know this is not popular for a lot of people.  Here we go.  I wonder what the percentage is.  I think it's a big percentage of people that don't like what she's doing.  No, I mean hunting in general, pro-anti...  Because now they want to talk about hunting in general.  Sean in Texas, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, guys.  I respect that everyone has an opinion.  It's fine if you like hunting, you don't like hunting.  Either way, it's fine.  But...  And I've been to Africa.  I've been three times.  I went over there and I shot a Cape Buffalo a few years ago. 
[02:20:30]  I stalked him on foot.  Was it Super Buffalo?  Yeah, exactly.  Would he have a big B on his cape?  Yeah, what happened?  He was a big, bad sumbitch.  And you know what?  He'd been harassing the people in a village.  He had stomped an old man a couple nights before.  He's bullying.  We hunted him down.  Bullying.  And I killed the sumbitch.  But you know what we did?  Sumbitch.  That buffalo weighs 1,600 pounds.  And we took the meat from that buffalo.  And we went and we distributed it to all the villages around there.  And you know what? 
[02:21:00]  You say it's 2013.  Why do we have villages?  Fucking go to Africa.  There's villages everywhere.  Let me tell you what.  You don't know poor until you've been over there.  Let me ask you a question.  It's not my fucking problem.  Can I ask you a question about the meat thing?  Like, I understand, okay, they're eating it.  But, like, the Africans know how to hunt.  They don't need Americans to come over and do it.  So what is the...  Hold on, hold on.  Let me ask you.  They absolutely know how to get rid of a buffalo in Africa.  What is the attraction for you to do it? 
[02:21:30]  Jimmy, they don't.  See, what you're saying...  You're speaking from a position of...  And I'm not going to...  I'm not saying ignorant, but you're speaking...  You're not speaking from a position of knowledge.  They don't...  They do know that you can kill a buffalo, but they don't have the means to do it.  And you say, well, let's just get some money and go do that.  Well, yeah, and, you know, and fucking rainbows and unicorns and all that stuff would be great, too.  But that doesn't happen, and that's not the real world.  So you're saying that Africans, without you going...  So you brought your gun from America?  Yes. 
[02:22:00]  How'd you get it to Africa?  I guess you put it in the bottom.  So you brought your gun into Africa, and you killed the...  Buffalo, that you stalked on foot, because the Africans would not have been able to stalk  and kill a buffalo.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  The Africans would not be able to stalk and kill a buffalo.  I could see that.  Sure, because there's nobody poachers over there killing everything that walks.  There are poachers.  Hundreds of thousands of years ago.  You're right, guys.  The population explosion in Africa in the last hundred years is so...  It's so incomprehensible. 
[02:22:30]  I mean, there are so many people over there now, and they're so overpopulated, and there's so many of them.  And another thing, the game population, these wild animals, you'll talk about these wild animals,  was down to almost nothing.  And when countries started realizing that, you know, there is an industry here,  there's a sport hunting industry, and we want these animals around into perpetuity,  and the way to do that is, we're going to promote sport hunting.  By the Congo?  We're going to promote the sport hunting.  Dude, so you didn't answer, what's the attraction for you? 
[02:23:00]  He likes hunting.  You know what?  It's something I've done all my life.  It was something I was brought up around.  You know, we don't all...  And I'm not knocking you, but we weren't all raised in New York City, on Long Island.  New York City?  I understand that.  So I was raised in the country.  I was raised, you know, and I was raised in an area where we could do that.  And that was just part of what we did.  I mean, that's just like y'all getting up and walking down to Central Park is what you do. 
[02:23:30]  What?  He got up when we went hunting.  I don't think I've ever done that.  But I'm saying you're going to another country.  You're flying across the world.  So I'm asking what the attraction is for you.  There's a lot of excitement there.  I mean, it's a challenge.  Exciting hunting something.  You don't ride around in a truck, spot it, get out of the truck, shoot it, and then go stand next to it.  You know, I walk miles and miles every day.  That's what George Zimmerman does.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  They have easier hunting laws in Florida.  I really do believe, though, that either...  I don't think you're lying.  I think you're being honest.  But I do think that we all know that there are people in Africa who could take care of a rogue buffalo.  That's true.  And they do say it, again, as Ope said, people could sleep better at night.  They don't need Americans going over there taking care of their animal pride.  I don't believe that.  Okay, wait a second.  Now, what you just said, you're right. 
[02:24:30]  There are people in Africa that have guns that can shoot the buffalo.  But what you've got to remember is you and I put a value on that animal.  We value that animal.  Well, the indigenous people over in Africa don't.  They see that buffalo as he walks through the village.  He walks through our garden.  He kills his...  And we're just going to kill...  Sure.  And it's the same thing that happened in Kenya.  You know, Kenya stopped sport hunting back in the 70s.  And what happened?  They have the worst poaching problem there is.  Kenya's wild game population has dropped 85% in the last 30 years because they stopped sport hunting. 
[02:25:00]  What happens is the poachers say, there is no value on that animal to me anymore.  So, or the villagers do.  They'll kill it.  The poachers will kill it.  And the animals are gone.  They kill it because people, a lot of them are in China, the poachers kill it.  Hard on.  Hard on dust.  They buy, exactly.  They want hard on dust made out of horns.  And people, these fucking pigs, want to use these horns and these tusks to make little trinkets for themselves. 
[02:25:30]  And little shitty...  You're right.  That's the mentality.  It's the same not valuing...  Remember, a poacher doesn't put any value on the existence of that animal anymore.  Or its species anymore.  They'll kill and kill and kill until the animals are all gone.  At least in a sport hunting society...  Society.  You manage how many animals you manage.  Okay, I get all that.  Hold on.  All right.  I get all that.  You gave us a lot of info today. 
[02:26:00]  Hold on.  I want to ask you a question.  As a human being, first of all, what's the biggest thing you killed?  What's the biggest animal?  That cape buffalo.  And you had no guilt whatsoever to see this thing just be dead because of you?  No.  God, that's so weird to me.  All right.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  I mean, I was put on this earth to...  You know what?  I believe our job is to manage those species because they can't manage themselves.  Manage it?  We're destroying species.  They can't manage themselves.  We don't manage animals. 
[02:26:30]  The industry does.  Look at all the animals that are extinct because it's human beings.  We're not managing anything.  We don't give a fuck.  Hey, you're exactly right.  And if sport hunting didn't exist, look at Kenya.  If sport hunting doesn't exist, that's exactly what happens to them.  They don't have any value anymore, and people kill them off.  It's just weird.  I just know I can...  All right.  Well...  I see his point.  Yeah, I understand what he's saying.  And there is a different thing.  Like, there's some people that are hunters and can hunt and have a whole philosophy behind 
[02:27:00]  it, and others that are repulsed by it.  Never the twain shall meet.  The truth of the matter is, I don't have any problem with hunting.  And even in some instances, big game hunting.  I don't know about the parading it around and showing it off kind of a thing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I got no problem.  I like hunters.  It's not for me, but I got no problem with it, especially for food.  I mean, really. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to Michigan and talking to Dan.  What's up, Dan?  Dan the man?  Yeah, Dan the man.  Of course.  Hey, real quick.  And I want to make this, you know, be concise here.  I'm not an abortion nut job, and I'm also, I don't hunt much.  Love abortions.  I just want you to, I want Jimmy to think about something for a second.  How do you care about a lion that's wandering in Africa and saying he's an innocent being 
[02:28:00]  and he can't kill it, but you're okay?  He should be fucking telling the truth.  Yeah, exactly.  What's he lying for?  God, I'm teasing.  Now, I know exactly where you're going, and I'll answer your question.  You're saying, how can I be for abortion and be for these lions?  And the question is, I'll tell you, it's twofold the answer.  One, I have inconsistencies like every other person.  And as I've said before, if you know my position on abortion, I've said that deep down, underneath  all of it, I do think that the right to lifers are correct. 
[02:28:30]  I think as a species, the right to lifers are probably right.  But I want abortion to be legal because I want the convenience of it.  So it's a selfish thing.  So I'm acknowledging it's a selfish thing.  I'm not pretending.  Hold on.  You want some lady to have her private town by an elephant because she's a lion.  I'm answering your question.  Well, there's some humor in there, too, sir.  Jesus Christ.  There was kind of a joke in there, as well, as he was making a pretty strong point. 
[02:29:00]  Exactly.  I'm acknowledging your fucking point.  I am for it because it's convenient to me.  I've said before that if I couldn't get a girl pregnant, I'd probably be very pro-life.  But since I can, fuck it, abortions all over.  So that's why I'm doing it.  I'm acknowledging my selfishness.  Yeah, well, okay.  I just, you know, I think you get all worked up so much. 
[02:29:30]  I just acknowledge myself.  Like, dude, because I didn't give you the argument point you wanted,  I just kind of deflated your argument.  Now you're going to try to go left and find another point.  I just said it's because I'm selfish.  Okay, but would you accept that answer from the lady that killed the lion?  She wouldn't give that answer.  What?  Okay.  That's why I hate her.  I hate the lie.  I'm doing it because I want to help the indigenous population.  Shut up.  No, you don't.  And I don't think it's okay to shoot a lion. 
[02:30:00]  I think it's retarded.  But I just, I've always had this question about things.  But, you know, I thought it was funny to ask.  You know, I once, and I'm not for late-term abortions, by the way.  I do think there has to be a limit.  Yeah.  I think the right to, the pro-choices are out of their minds going way too far.  Yeah.  And the idea of putting any limit on a woman's right.  Look, if you're yanking out a fucking kid, and you yank out the baby arm, and he pokes  his head out and goes, what are you doing?  It's a little too fucking late.  What are you doing?  You know what I mean?  I think that they're also out of whack.  Yeah.  I got a hunting story for you.  I once shot a bear in my pajamas. 
[02:30:30]  And how he got in my pajamas, I have no idea.  I call Bravo Sierra.  By the way, I just blocked a real scumbag on Twitter.  Why?  And it feels so good.  Yeah, you got him.  What did he say?  What did he say?  What did he say?  Who knows?  He's just a scumbag.  He wanted his voice heard.  Oh, I love doing that.  I like my voice to be heard.  You got two followers, so no one really listens to you.  And now you think I'm going to retweet you so you get an audience? 
[02:31:00]  Bye-bye.  I want you to know how.  Let me say this.  I have never complained that someone has blocked me because I've never known if they did.  Yes, true.  Not once in my Twitter career, however long that's been, have I known if I've been blocked.  That's a great point.  I don't give a fuck if people are blocking me.  You care less?  I don't really care.  I don't care.  I can't think of one instance where I was like, holy shit, how dare you block me?  Never.  Because I only follow people who I want to hear from.  That's it. 
[02:31:30]  So it's satisfying.  Supposedly she hired someone to bring the lion to her.  Well, whatever it is.  It's your story on Facebook.  People are a little confused.  You know, if you could hunt, all right.  I don't know.  I got my opinion on it.  Opinion on it.  It's rough.  It's rough for me to see that shit.  That's all.  She hired someone to bring the lion to her.  I don't know if that's true or not.  Hmm.  I don't know.  We're not managing animals as a species. 
[02:32:00]  It's just delusional.  We're shitty toward animals.  We all know that.  Yeah.  There's a very, very, very small percentage of people out there, you know, fighting the  fight to actually, you know, preserve species and stuff and manage them.  But the rest of us, we don't give a fuck.  I think when you get to the point where you're doling out, like here in the United States,  you're doling out hunting license and fishing license and stuff.  And there are criteria to it and seasons and whatnot.  And you have to be licensed to get your tags and stuff.  I do think that they can take into consideration the population of the animals, where they are, 
[02:32:30]  whether there's too many of them, not enough of them, and deal out tags accordingly.  And I think that does help the animals.  Now, in a world where we're walking around and living in caves and swinging clubs, I don't  think it was needed.  In this world that we live in, where men are taking over land and building houses and buildings  and hunting, then I do think there needs to be some type of arrangement with Mother Nature, 
[02:33:00]  where we do help out the animals and the environment through hunting.  I do believe that.  I honestly do.  I just can't be one of those people.  I had a beach house this summer, and even fishing.  Like, I didn't fish because I don't want to fucking yank the goddamn hook out of its mouth.  I feel the same way.  I saw some horrific things this summer, not because the person or people, in this case, 
[02:33:30]  were shitty fishermen.  At times, that hook gets deep down there, and it's brutal what you've got to do to get  your hook free.  Oh, yeah.  And I just imagine myself, I'm like, that's why I'm not fishing.  I don't want to be in that position.  You know me.  I love guns.  I'm a fucking pussy when it comes to that shit.  I love my guns.  I don't like hunting.  I'm not a hunter.  I'm a shooter.  I like shooting.  I like shooting at targets.  I like the idea of having a gun for personal protection, things like that.  But I don't like the idea of going out and killing an animal. 
[02:34:00]  It makes me feel bad.  I wouldn't do that.  But I did see some of the fishermen.  They have the cigarette hanging out of their mouth, and they just fucking yank without any  of regard.  Oh, like Al-Qaeda.  They're slapping heads off.  They don't care.  And that's why I asked the other guy, because I can't imagine that.  That's all.  Yeah.  I just can't imagine doing that.  I would feel horrendous if I saw a massive, beautiful animal alive and then all of a sudden  dead because of me.  I'd feel like shit.  That's all.  That's all.  Yeah.  But I also don't have a problem with hunters. 
[02:34:30]  People that could do that.  I don't have any problem with hunting.  Sometimes I'm amazed by some of the skill it takes, especially a bow hunter, things like  that.  It's kind of amazing.  But it's not my cup of tea, as they say.  You want the African viewpoint?  Sure.  You guys don't know how to fend for yourselves.  At least they do.  All right.  In Africa? 
[02:35:00]  I guess.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I don't.  I'm not the one saying I need to go over to Africa and control everything.  Let's go to Jamie in Pennsylvania.  Jamie.  My point is that as far as Jimmy wanted to know what would make somebody want to go  over there and kill one and what would make them want us to go there, it's just money.  Yes.  These little villages, they don't have a mini mart to sell Slurpees out of or a radio station  to work at.  There's no job. 
[02:35:30]  So if they want, you know, if one of us wants to go over there.  Yeah.  They're obviously taking the money.  We can take our money.  It's either that or you're paddling out to a fucking cargo ship to pirate it.  What's that?  Ship.  No, I...  Ship.  I understand.  Dude, I understand that.  And I know it's about the money for the Africans.  So I'm not...  I get that part of it.  The part that I don't like is the lie about the motive.  Well, I'm trying to put money back and I'm help.  It's like, stop bullshitting yourself.  You know what it is?  It's just as simple as like, you know, if you're used to white girls and you want to 
[02:36:00]  whack off on a Chinese girl's pits, you have to find a Chinese girl.  Yeah, but you don't fucking pay someone to hold her down while you kill her.  I know.  I'm with you.  I'm trying.  Believe me.  I think there's some justification going on.  That's all.  Yeah.  That's all.  Yes.  Yes.  I mean, I would like for the hunters to call up and go, look, I want to kill a fucking  lion and I don't give a fuck what they do with the animal after I'm done.  There are people.  Absolutely.  There's a nice percentage of people that that's absolutely what they think. 
[02:36:30]  To justify and go, well, I do it because the money's going toward the...  That's bullshit.  But, you know, I was always taught you don't shoot it unless you're going to eat it.  My grandfather, if he pulled it out of the water with a hook, he ate it.  He said, but come.  He ate it.  Shoot it.  Unless you're going to eat it.  What if it's an ugly sea robin?  Your grandpa's eating the sea robin?  I don't think so.  I see robin. 
[02:37:00]  He ate it.  You know, what he used to say is it was all fucking Walt Disney's fault.  He said, back in the old days, everybody looked at animals as food.  And as soon as Walt Disney turned them into cartoons, everybody thought they were tootin'  That's kind of funny.  Yeah, he's right.  Walt Disney's.  Yeah, Walt Disney's.  You know, but his most popular character, we still fucking snap in half in traps.  That is true.  I don't think that makes a big difference.  And then...  Mickey Rat.  There you go.  Hold on.  To she.  Shea. 
[02:37:30]  And then Dennis Leary has that brilliant bit about how he only saved the cute animals.  Yes.  I'm not really sure where he got that bit from, but it is a good one.  Yeah, yeah.  That is a good one.  But it's terrific.  Do we have that to go to break?  That's terrific.  Maybe we wrap up this nice segment with that, Iraq.  What do you say?  Huh?  I'm going to look for it.  Before you find it, Leary did a bit fucking...  It was on the animal thing.  It was fucking...  It wasn't about killing cute animals. 
[02:38:00]  It was about, like, the Netflix revolution and how, like, comedy specials will just show  up on it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I heard about that.  Wow.  Yeah.  What, uh...  You know, I just wanted to say that my friend Jim Norton is going to be on Netflix starting  tonight, American Degenerate.  Oh, I don't like this really special.  Good special.  You can go to JimNorton.com.  Plugging like Todd Pettengill.  Desperate am I.  American Degenerate is now available on Netflix. 
[02:38:30]  Jim Norton's latest fucking comedy special.  Go get it.  Just try to find fun ways to plug.  I should be decapitated.  And some asshole lied to me.  They said Dennis Leary's documentary on Detroit and their fire departments was available on  Netflix, finally.  I didn't see it.  What's it called?  Isn't it called Burn?  Burn.  I didn't see it.  How the fuck do I see that documentary?  What's it on?  Huh?  Is it in theaters?  Is it on iTunes or something?  I didn't see it, man. 
[02:39:00]  No?  If someone knows where the fuck it is for real, please let me know.  This special made him a big star.  I mean, I think this...  Well, yeah.  Mom.  Has he got the cute animals thing?  Iraq, you don't have it.  What is this about?  It's off no cure.  Oh, yeah?  For cancer.  Hell yeah, it is.  You got it?  Yeah.  How long is the whole clip?  Well, it's not all about...  Most of it's about smoking.  You know, how long is it?  Ten minutes.  Perfect.  Iraq.  You want to hear the smoking part, too? 
[02:39:30]  His smoking material's terrific.  You like it.  Yeah.  Watch.  Iraq, did you think you skated with all the...  Talk we've had?  Were you sitting there like, oh, God.  Had a few war buffalo jokes myself.  I was holding back.  We were being very nice.  Hey, this is Eric.  Chubsy-ubsy, I'm calling.  Because I stepped on something and broke the whole floor.  Can we make Iraq balloon?  Oh, wow.  There's not enough air in the world to make a balloon of that piece of fucking garbage. 
[02:40:00]  You guys did a bit on big game hunting?  Yeah.  Yeah, like Monopoly.  Jesus Christ.  That's so annoying, Bobo Cole.  You're my weapon.  Before that, earlier today?  Nothing.  Yeah.  We did a break on killer whales.  Whoa.  Nothing for the big guy in there.  Well, we still feel a little guilty about the phone thing.  Yeah.  We?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all had a part in that.  Yeah, but do we all feel guilty?  I do.  For real?  I didn't really, um...  You good with it?  I felt nothing.  No. 
[02:40:30]  Jesus.  When did you feel something?  Stop it.  I don't know.  Let us know when you do.  I love my cat.  You look in there and you see him swimming around like an orca.  Over there with no water.  Hey, look.  Oh, God.  He's like a big orca.  In a tank with no water.  Oh, shit.  You want the...  What?  You want the Dennis Leary thing?  Well, only if we can play the smoking stuff, too, because the smoking stuff really is terrific.  There's no reason to play 10 minutes of Dennis Leary.  I don't like fucking editing comedians' shit. 
[02:41:00]  The whole piece is 10 minutes.  Plus the fact Bloomberg raised the price of cigarettes, the age of...  Oh, so it's topical?  Now it's topical, see?  Now you gotta be 21 in New York to buy cigarettes.  Perfect.  Now we can do a smoking business.  Uh-huh.  Is that where he picks up on the cute animals?  Yes.  All right.  We'll do that.  I was just fucking around.  We'll continue.  And in Horkin fiber chunks, you know, cereal used to come with free prizes.  Now it comes with a free roll of toilet paper in every box. 
[02:41:30]  Guys get up on Sunday morning.  Forget about the New York Times.  I'm gonna need the Bible.  I got a big one brewing here.  Dad, there's a phone call.  I'm on Genesis, God damn it.  You tell them to call back out to the creation.  People checking their own feces for fiber.  You have too much free fucking time on your hands.  Okay?  Let me tell you something, folks.  You are going to eat the meat.  Oh, yes, you are.  Oh, yeah.  You might have quit meat now.  But eventually, two years from now or five years from now or a few days from now, you  are going to eat the fucking meat.  I'm telling you right now.  Because you have to face a cold, hard fact that you vegetarians must stare in the face 
[02:42:00]  every goddamn day that you're eating vegetables.  Eggplant tastes like eggplant.  But meat tastes like murder and murder tastes pretty goddamn good, doesn't it?  Yes, it does.  Yes, it does.  And I know.  You don't want to eat the meat because I love the animals.  That's why I don't want to eat them.  Yeah, me too.  I love animals.  I love my dog.  Oh, he's so cute, my doggy.  I love him.  But that's the problem.  We only want to save the cute animals, don't we? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Why don't we just have animal auditions?  Line them up one by one and interview them individually.  What are you?  I'm an otter.  And what do you do?  I swim around my back and do cute little human things with my hands.  You're free to go.  And what are you?  I'm a cow.  Get in the fucking truck, okay, pal?  But I'm an animal.  You're a baseball glove.  Get on that truck.  I'm an animal.  I have rights here.  Here's your fucking cousin.  Get on the truck, pal.  We kill the cows to make jackets out of them, and then we kill each other for the jackets 
[02:43:00]  we made out of the cows.  The O.B. and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  Yes.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you.  Hey, that giant 747 cargo plane that landed. 
[02:43:30]  It landed at the wrong airport in Wichita, Kansas.  Right.  Apparently, it made a mistake.  It landed in an airport that's much too small for it to take off from.  Sure.  They're going to try to take off at 1 o'clock.  Wow!  So that's going to be fun to watch.  Is it a plane?  I bet they're throwing everything the fuck out of that plane.  But that means they feel pretty confident they can get that off the ground.  I would assume they probably do.  I don't think they're going to...  They crunched the numbers.  They crunched some numbers.  They crunched some numbers. 
[02:44:00]  And you know what?  We got this.  I bet here's what they do.  We got this.  I bet you here's what they do.  Yeah.  They only fuel it to land at a very nearby airport.  Sure.  To get the rest of the fuel.  That way, it's a lot lighter.  Right.  Well, fuel-wise.  And nothing in there.  And they might be able to survive if there's a bit of an issue.  If there's an issue.  If they maybe go off the end of the runway.  Who's not watching that at 1 o'clock?  That does sound kind of fun.  I hope they got cameras on that.  Yeah, there's cameras on it right now, so I'm sure they're not going anywhere.  Good.  And then they've got to just get every bit of cargo out of that fucking thing. 
[02:44:30]  They'll probably truck it from where it is to the airport that they're going to land at.  Fuck that.  They'll probably take everything they can out of it.  Yeah.  Seats.  They're just throwing seats out.  The bathroom.  Like an old World War II thing.  As it's rolling down the runway, they're still throwing shit out.  All the sodas.  Bowling balls and anvils for some reason are on the plane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that sounds kind of exciting.  Who announced Wi-Fi for the complete flight this morning? 
[02:45:00]  Southwest, was it?  I wasn't united.  That hunk of shit.  No, because supposedly, I didn't understand this, someone that certainly knows more about  this than me could help.  Southwest has the little domes on all their planes.  But they have their own shit, supposedly, that's slightly different than the regular  Wi-Fi, and that's why they could do it, and it could take the other airlines a few  years to catch up, and that's why they're not officially offering it yet.  Does anyone know about this?  Is it a technology issue?  That's what I'm saying.  Man, their Wi-Fi is a little different, so they could offer gate-to-gate Wi-Fi, but 
[02:45:30]  that's as far I could go with this.  Well, they probably have to...  We need an IT guy.  I would assume you've got to have some fucking Wi-Fi transmitters at the airports and stuff,  or is it all satellite?  I was under the impression, but it was very early, and I was only up a mere minutes when  I was starting to listen to the news, that it was a slightly different type of Wi-Fi.  Yeah?  Yes.  Well, it's pretty good.  It is nice to have Wi-Fi up there, huh?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Am I right or am I wrong?  I'd never turn my fucking phone off.  Yeah, I say, why not, Fi?  You know why?  That's a good one, too.  You know why I knew that was all bullshit?  Because they had to trust you.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why I knew it was like, the odds of something happening, because you keep your phone  on are so slim, or they would have to take your phone.  They would take your phone.  They would have to.  If there was a real situation that could happen, they would just collect all your shit,  before, and then give it back to you when you land.  It was never proven that there was any problem with the instruments that they used to take 
[02:46:30]  off and land their navigation equipment.  And then Mythbusters did a demonstration on how their phones don't interfere with any of  the instruments on a plane.  Right.  And they always go to the extreme of it, so they tried it with the phones and everything,  and when that did nothing, they took the signals from the phones and amplified the living shit  out of them to the point that no phone, or a plane full of phones on the same frequency,  would never do that.  And it still didn't do anything. 
[02:47:00]  I flew recently for my little trip to Rochester slash Buffalo.  And your arms were killing you?  They were killing me.  Ah.  That's a funny one.  And they fucking took my toothpaste.  I made a rookie mistake.  Oh, man.  You put it in your hiney?  Put it in my hiney.  Hiney.  Fucking rookie mistake.  All of a sudden, it's going through the, you know, the metal, the scanners, whatever.  Sure, can we look in here?  And I saw the lady's face.  I'm like, oh, fuck, what's in my thing?  And it was this stupid toothpaste they had to take out.  Cocaine.  But they left my razors in there. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Don't you think that's so stupid?  You can make a makeshift weapon with your dumb razors if you had to.  More so than you could toothpaste.  Right.  I think they think you're like James Bond.  You got some C4 in that fucking toothpaste tube.  Oh, God, please.  Squeezing it out.  I think we could figure out if there's C4 in my toothpaste.  Probably.  I think you could just look at you and know you're probably not fucking.  Absolutely.  No, I'm against that.  Yeah?  Are you against that?  Yeah, because I think the next terrorist is going to be somebody you didn't expect.  Chechnya, maybe.  Yeah, that's why.  No, fuck.  I want profiling to go on, but I also want everyone fucking checked. 
[02:48:00]  Why assume the grandma isn't part of some shit that she didn't even know about?  Well, you're playing the odds.  Oh, by the way, good point.  You know, I've noticed that there's a thing in the airport now where they say if you're  over 75 or under 12, you don't have to take your shoes off.  Oh, boy.  And I have not heard one person complain about profiling.  I have not heard one person complain about age discrimination.  Well, if you're profiling that, old people probably wouldn't be. 
[02:48:30]  Okay, then.  All right.  So now I'm a terrorist, and I know this information.  Oh, don't say that, old people.  Shit.  Oh, really?  No fly list right there.  Holy fuck, you're so right.  But, all right, I'm one of those people, and I know this is the new rule.  Why wouldn't you try to get something done with some old broad somewhere?  Of course.  Yeah, you would.  Absolutely.  You're in the airport, and you're like, hey, I got your new shoes, you old bat.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Exactly.  It's interesting to me how they don't complain.  Not one old person has said, why are you treating me differently because I'm old? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Not one.  That's where that, if anyone complains about the fraud, and I have people go, well, the  difference is they're assuming you're innocent, not guilty, and that's the country's  very sorry.  But when it's a safety issue, just don't complain about profiling.  People don't like a fucking negative profile.  It's reverse profiling, really.  But in doing, in saying that kids and older people aren't terrorists, you're profiling  everyone else and saying that there's a potential that they could be, and that's profiling. 
[02:49:30]  If I was TSA, I would be patting every fucking hot chick's hiney.  Would you?  Yeah.  I'm sure I thought of it.  Of course.  Nice.  Yeah, right.  It's random.  Know when it's not random anymore?  When that fucking hot ass comes through.  We're like, okay, time to pat again.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you take advantage of your little power you got at the airport?  Mm-hmm.  Damn.  But they got my fucking toothpaste.  I was mad.  And then I'm sitting there going, okay, I got to carry on with my toiletry bag, and there's 
[02:50:00]  fucking razors in there.  Go in the bathroom, you fucking pop off the top, and you can make a little something if  you had to.  Yeah.  I hope you said that to them.  Yeah.  A little delay getting where you want to go.  A little search-a-roonie up your old poop chute.  And you're lucky.  No, no, leave the rings on.  It's fine.  Yeah, that's, uh...  Oh, man.  The whole thing is stupid.  It's my point, I guess.  It does seem a little random. 
[02:50:30]  Because if you really want to try to figure something out, you could figure stuff out while  you're on the plane.  Yeah, and I don't think it's so much that they know they're going to catch anybody.  I think it's the thought that if it's random enough and weird enough, uh...  It'll deter.  It'll deter, yeah, because you'll never know when you're going to be checked.  Seems to be working.  Uh, yeah, that airplane thing is the...  That's the fucking...  That's the biggie of terrorism.  Always has been.  Oh, they want... 
[02:51:00]  They want to go back to that.  Yeah.  And there's so many things in place.  And now you have just a flying public that is aware and ready for action.  I don't think as much as they used to be.  Right.  But, um...  What do you know on the Southwest Airlines Wi-Fi?  Is it a little different than regular Wi-Fi?  Uh, I don't...  I don't know, technically...  I'm trying to figure out how tired I was this morning when I heard this story.  You might have been a little sleepy.  Yeah, I felt like it was some kind of voodoo Wi-Fi.  Oh.  It was a little voodoo. 
[02:51:30]  Magic?  Yes.  I think it's got to be satellite-based.  Because it kind of...  You know what, the other airlines don't have their satellites set for Wi-Fi?  Well, they don't...  I guess not.  And they also, uh...  Don't have gate-to-gate.  This is the big thing is that you'll be able to use anything that's a tablet or smaller while the plane's taking off.  This is...  Americans, Americans, they use Go...  What's it?  Uh...  Go-Go.  In-flight Go-Go.  It's fucking horrendous, their connection.  Really?  It's horrendous. 
[02:52:00]  Oh.  Maybe this is old planes or something.  Maybe this is old planes or something.  News for us?  Yeah.  Yes, it's satellite-based.  Satellite-based.  And the other airlines don't have that, huh?  No, they use...  I think it's called Go-Go?  Yeah, Go-Go.  Yeah, that's what Jimmy was just saying.  He was just talking about that.  Yeah, why don't you go-go outside, motherfucker?  Oh, shit!  And what is that, on some type of radio frequency or something?  It's only activated when you're in the sky.  Yeah.  But why?  I don't know.  It's terrible.  It's probably because of the FAA rules that you couldn't have. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, look at the FAAG telling us about the FAA.  Exactly.  Wait.  Jesus.  Hold on.  Love that.  No, he's calling you a fag.  Very good, Chippa.  Instead of a fa.  I would think they'd all be satellite-based.  I know.  I think because of the regulations that just got lifted, they weren't like that.  But now that they are lifted, I'm sure this is going to be everywhere.  Because United doesn't have it on cross-country flights.  American does it the best they can, but it's not that good. 
[02:53:00]  It's just terrible.  United, then decide.  That was their old thing.  United hooked my shit up, so I have nothing bad to say about them, man.  Yeah, you'll find a good one every once in a while.  I'm sure even certain Nazis would bring extra food for the fucking prisoners.  This guy fucking hooked me up without making me pay extra.  Nice.  I wanted to throw a little something-something, but I was down to six bucks.  Yeah?  Holy shit.  I was so bummed.  Six bucks.  I thought when you said I wanted to throw him a little something-something extra, you were 
[02:53:30]  going to say, but he wouldn't accept it.  Right, right.  I looked at my wallet, but I didn't.  Because this guy went way out of his way, which is so rare, as we all know.  Because the story goes, I was going to eat my Delta ticket and get a new ticket with United,  which they hiked the rates because of all that wind and tornado shit, because flights  were being canceled all over.  So they had the upper hand, so they wanted to charge me six hundred sixty bucks.  And the guy goes, you should have just been transferred to our airline.  I go, well, I wasn't.  And he goes, well, let me see what I could do.  And then he went out of his way and made calls and got it done. 
[02:54:00]  Did you give him the six?  No, because I thought that would be embarrassing.  At least it's something.  That's better than nothing.  I know.  And then I just had to give him a really, really great thank you.  I figured that would help.  Like, just an over-the-top, like, oh, my God, thank you so much.  What was he looking?  He, uh...  They wouldn't have accepted it.  All the cameras in airports, he would never have taken it.  I think he was making up for his speech impediment, to be honest with you.  Oh, you really want to break it down.  Break down.  He was a stutterer. 
[02:54:30]  Was he?  I was trying to make believe I didn't notice, though.  It's like, I don't have time.  I'm trying to catch a flight.  Spit it out, you little fucking freak.  I was making believe I didn't know.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was just totally focused on his eyes.  Oh, I know.  I hadn't...  It's so hard to make believe.  Oh, my God.  I was making believe.  It's so hard.  I was like his hero, because I didn't have one reaction to that...  Well, we got a...  I could get you with the...  Oh, God. 
[02:55:00]  Just trying to keep eye contact way longer than the sentence should be going for.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I looked...  Say you're panicking in your head.  Then I looked around for an ATM machine.  I mean, I couldn't find one.  And this plane was boarding.  I mean, I needed an ATM machine within 100 feet of the favorite guy.  Still, the six would have gotten him a Cinnabon.  I was embarrassed, because I thought I at least had maybe a 20 in there.  He loses.  I was going to give him 100.  He probably would not have taken it.  What the hell's that about?  I would have just left it on the counter. 
[02:55:30]  God, I dropped my phone again, clumsy fucking fag.  Jesus.  I know.  I dropped it twice.  It's not Travis's fault.  I'm not talking to Travis.  I'm talking to me.  That's the same thing I say in the mirror when I'm brushing my teeth.  What?  With a man's dick.  This guy's going to explain the Wi-Fi way that never ends.  Wait till you hear this one.  Go ahead, Chris.  I got a friend who's a pilot who said that part of the reason that they want you to power 
[02:56:00]  down devices in the beginning, at the beginning and end of each slide.  It's not because they interfere, it's because they want you to be paying attention.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, exactly.  The likelihood...  Why would you want to pay attention if you're going to die in a fiery fucking plane crash?  Wouldn't you want to be very distracted?  I'd rather catch that last tweet.  Because if it's going to happen, it's going to happen on takeoff or landing, and they want  you to be alert so you can be able to evacuate properly and all that. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, and follow instructions.  But as far as paying attention is concerned, this one guy goes, you fell poor, you can't  pay attention.  I was fucking rolling.  Oh.  All right, thank you, sir.  I don't believe that, though.  You don't need to pay attention, because there's nothing you can do to save your ass if you're  in that situation.  Although most plane crashes are survivable, unless they plummet, people survive most of them,  so maybe they want you to get in a position. 
[02:57:00]  Who the fuck, though?  It's just more nonsense.  If you noticed, more people are surviving plane crashes these days.  There's a lot fewer plane crashes than there used to be.  And more people are surviving.  We got one right around the corner.  Thank you, Jinxer.  Yeah, oh boy.  There you go.  That take place during takeoff and landing.  Mostly landing, it seems like you're getting a lot more people surviving.  They've expended a lot of the fuel, and the speeds are a little slower. 
[02:57:30]  Then take off, and you're going toward the ground slowly, instead of up, where something  can happen, and you fucking fall out of the sky.  But yeah, I think a lot of safety things have been put in place over the years.  Kind of work.  And every crash, they fucking...  I watch those horrible plane crash shows on TV.  Man, they pick apart...  I hope you're a star in one.  Says the guy who's going to go flying.  Oh, yeah, I am.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  We're flying for tomorrow. 
[02:58:00]  Huh?  Tomorrow you fly?  No.  Oh.  Next week.  Oh, it's next week?  Next week.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I hope everything goes fine.  Me too swimmingly.  No metal fatigue on your plane?  I hope not.  Who gets sick of that?  Because it's heavy metal.  It's like metal.  Yeah.  Give me a new Pecker song.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Another Pecker song.  Great.  We'll catch on.  Great.  And we got the last guy was full of shit phone calls. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, great.  Do you want to take one?  Of course.  All right.  Steve in Texas.  Steve.  All right.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Chris in North Carolina.  Hey.  All right, guys.  They all want to do the bit.  Do the bit instead of just doing the bit.  No, you just do the bit.  Just call and just say it normally.  We do that part.  That's a guy who plays shit.  Yeah.  We do that part based on what you guys do.  Right.  You just have to do it. 
[02:59:00]  You do the part where you correct the other guy.  That guy was full of shit.  Yeah, that last guy I called up, he was full of shit.  You don't have to go, uh, we go, uh.  The one thing I worry about when the plane is landing is a spinny wheel, I call it.  Spinny wheel.  That's it.  Yeah.  It, you know, when it touches down and the wheel catches, and then, and I think that  it might go spin to the side, and then, of course, all hell would have to break loose  at that point, because now it's not rolling nice.  Oh, like a shopping cart with a bad wheel? 
[02:59:30]  Yes.  You think it's going to pull that?  That's what I've been obsessed with lately.  Oh, man.  Spinny wheel, I call it.  Huh.  How do they prevent spinny wheel?  Well, the wheel...  It locks in, right?  No, the front wheel is going to face the same direction...  Always?  ...as the rudder.  Okay, good.  So he controls that.  All right, what if he's not paying attention on the rudder?  What the...  Then you could get spinny wheel, right?  But that's what you got to do.  And now, that's in an old plane, now they have a little hand wheel next to the seat  that actually steers the plane.  It controls the front steering, and you know if it's pointing straight ahead, or just like 
[03:00:00]  you would with the steering wheel in your car.  What if you have a, oh, fuck situation, where he realizes he didn't straighten that shit out?  I do believe right when...  We have to trust a guy to straighten out that wheel before we land?  No, I believe right when the landing gear comes down, the nose gear is all red.  All right, good.  Straight.  All right.  And then he adjusts accordingly after he touches down.  Okay.  But it's all rudder until he hits the ground anyway. 
[03:00:30]  All right, so I don't have to worry about spinny wheel?  No, I think you're okay with spinny wheel.  Oh, phew.  Spinny wheel.  Although they had that JetBlue flight that came in with the wheel completely 90 degrees.  Right, that's what I'm talking about.  To the plane, and it landed great.  It just wore it down halfway through the rim.  But it was right on the center line.  They had no idea if that was going to work.  Remember that one?  I think more dangerous than that would be if it was not 90 degrees, if it was at a 45 degree angle. 
[03:01:00]  Because then you're touching down, and now it's going to turn the plane off to the side.  Holy fuck.  I don't know what they'd do about that, because they couldn't bring it back in to just do a gearless landing.  I was on a plane that did a loop-de-loop one time.  Yeah?  Took off, did a bunch of loop-de-loops.  Loop-de-loops.  You're such an idiot.  You are an ass.  Everyone's spilling their coffee.  Oh, God.  Everyone was screaming, but I was laughing. 
[03:01:30]  Were you laughing?  Fuck yeah.  It's crazy.  Sometimes you do just resign yourself to death in a plane.  What?  A lot of turbulence or something like that.  You're just like, eh, whatevs.  You do.  You kind of go, whatevs.  Everyone says that.  Yeah.  You give up quick.  I do.  I've never been like, yeah, I guess I'm going to die.  Isn't that that filter song?  Isn't that what that's about?  Which one?  An airplane?  Yeah.  I think he's talking about the fact that when you're in that plane, you're just fucking, 
[03:02:00]  you're like, you might as well be a baby.  You're in their hands.  There's nothing else you could do.  Let's read the lyrics.  So you might as well just fucking be along for the ride.  I love that fucking song.  I don't know.  Do you like that song?  Wake on my airplane.  Wake on my airplane.  I don't know it.  Oh, God.  Take a picture.  It's a great filter song.  Let's end with it today.  Does the plane song have to go?  Vroom down the runway. 
[03:02:30]  And this makes sense, Sam, because we talked about airplanes.  This is the perfect way to end the show today.  I guess.  What's the part about taking the picture?  Could you take my picture?  Because I won't remember.  Could you take my picture?  Because I won't remember.  Could you take my picture?  Because I won't remember.  Could you take my picture?  Because I won't remember.  It seems like it's about getting high.  Yeah, well, of course.  It's him.  Who's taking the picture?  Oh, here's Ed's part.  I feel like newborn.  And I feel like a newborn. 
[03:03:00]  What are you doing?  Up here is where it starts with the airplane.  No, I want the newborn part.  Stop.  I feel like a newborn.  And I feel like a newborn.  Wake on my airplane.  I wake on my airplane.  I feel so real.  God, lyrics are so easy to write.  Oh, you just don't have to make sense.  It's just how you sing them, I guess.  Yes, and you don't have to make any sense.  I didn't realize how monotonous it reads.  Look, I'm not the one for translating what fucking writers have.  It just popped in my head.  Right.  You know.  I think he's just talking about getting hard.  It's just an aneurysm. 
[03:03:30]  Jesus Christ.  Let me see the first verse there.  Oh, my God.  We are so cruel.  Awake on my airplane.  Awake on my airplane.  My skin is bare.  My skin is theirs.  Awake on my airplane.  Awake on my airplane.  My skin is bare.  My skin is theirs.  Yeah.  That's all he wrote?  I know.  It just seems like he's awake.  He's on an airplane.  But then they sing it, and it sounds brilliant. 
[03:04:00]  His skin is theirs.  You know, he's got no control anymore.  Let's get the plugs in, because we're playing this for real.  Oh, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony podcast is out.  It's The Best of Mike Tyson.  Please go get it.  There's links on our Facebook page, hopefully.  It's on iTunes.  You just put Opie and Anthony in a pod fucking app search, and you'll find it.  All right?  Subscribe.  We're trying to figure out if it's a good business model for the future.  The future.  The Patrice O'Neal one did very well, and people are mad that certain bits weren't on there. 
[03:04:30]  Don't worry.  There's going to be many volumes of Patrice O'Neal on our podcast in coming months.  And then Jimmy's got The American Degenerate now available on Netflix.  Yes, as of today.  Tickets on sale for the Borgata starting tomorrow, February 14th that weekend.  I'm doing myself on Valentine's weekend.  And I'll be in Clinton, New Jersey tomorrow and Saturday at this Garden State Comedy Club.  The material is working out very fucking well.  Albany is great.  So I'm happy.  I'm happy.  It's pretty much a new hour. 
[03:05:00]  Nice.  And, you know, it's still in the works, but it's getting there quickly.  Yeah, but it's much better than I thought it was.  Good man.  Yeah.  Go to JimNorton.com.  I finally have my website up and running, and dates are available there.  Very cool.  All right.  That is?  Wow.  Here's Phil.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[03:05:30]  I wake on my airplane.  I wake on my airplane.  My skin is bare.  My skin is this.  I wake on my airplane.  I wake on my airplane.  My skin is bare.  My skin is this.  I feel like a newborn.  And I wake on my airplane. 
[03:06:00]  I wake on my airplane.  I feel like a newborn  I wake on my airplane, I wake on my airplane  I feel so young  Could you wanna take my picture? 
[03:06:30]  Cause I don't remember  Could you wanna take my picture?  Cause I don't remember  Yeah  I don't believe in, I don't believe in your sanctity 
[03:07:00]  Your privacy  I don't believe in, I don't believe in sanctity  Or hypocrisy  Can everyone agree that no one should be left alone?  Could everyone agree that they should not be left alone? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah  And I feel like a newborn  And I feel like a newborn  Kicking and screaming  Could you wanna take my picture? 
[03:08:00]  Cause I don't remember  Could you wanna take my picture?  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember 
[03:08:30]  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't remember  Could you wanna take my picture? 
[03:09:00]  Could you wanna take my picture?  Cause I don't remember  Could you wanna take my picture?  Cause I don't remember  Could you wanna take my picture?  Cause I don't remember  Cause I don't remember  I don't remember  Take my picture  Take my picture  Cause I don't remember  The O.P. and Anthony Show 
[03:09:30]  is pretty much over  This show will be available later today  with SiriusXM On Demand  After ONA Live is next  This is after O.P. and Anthony Live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Heard this song live last night  Yeah, me and Roland, we went to Yeezus  I'll get into that in a minute 
[03:10:00]  But first, the Kanye West tour  But first, I mean, the after show  With myself, Sam Roberts  This is becoming like A-list guest central  Vince Vaughn is coming in here  Now  He's in Delivery Man this weekend  It's the movie where he has like 500 kids  That he doesn't know about  Because he went to a sperm bank  A lot  And then he finds out he has all these kids  But Vince Vaughn  On his way in 
[03:10:30]  Right now  Yes, here he comes  Look who's here  Vince Vaughn, welcome  What's happening, how are you?  How are you?  I'm great, how are you?  Good  You got a big movie coming out  Yes, I got a fun movie coming out  Yeah, yeah  Delivery Man  That's right  Tell me  How much of this is dependent on you at this point?  Like how much responsibility do you take?  How much pressure do you feel?  Is this a Vince Vaughn vehicle?  Or is it  Well, it's part writing, it's part directing 
[03:11:00]  We'll see what happens  Well, you know, ultimately  I think film is a director's medium  As an actor  You ultimately are just trying to  Make your director happy  Depending on what tone that they're doing  I mean, you sort of go in  I see my job is to sort of be as honest  Within the scene as I can  Depending on the tone of the film  And, you know, ultimately  The director cuts the movie  Puts the music in  And does what they do  So you feel comfortable doing your best  And then letting go  And then letting go  And the director here is really exceptional 
[03:11:30]  Ken Scott  I'm doing another movie with him actually  That Steve Conrad  Who wrote Pursuit of Happiness wrote  And it's with Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco  And I think what's unique about him is that  He's very authentic  The movies can be very funny  But dramatic  Kind of moving  And it sort of doesn't just play in one genre  For the whole film  I also  I was thinking while I was watching it  That a lot of thought must be put into  In a movie like this  Making it appeal to 
[03:12:00]  A large demographic meaning  Making sure there's this heartfelt story  That girls are gonna love  But then also sprinkling in some shit  And abortion jokes  And stuff like that in the beginning  That somebody like me  Or somebody who is used to  You in old school  And dodgeball and stuff like that  Can enjoy too  Yeah, I think less so  I think, you know, what's nice about this  Is it's kind of defiantly  A man's journey about becoming a father  Mm-hmm  Not to give away too much  But even with the ending  It's really  I think what swingers was  As far as  It's about a guy's perspective 
[03:12:30]  Of going through a breakup  Mm-hmm  And when we made that movie  It was swing music  And dialogue  And stuff that wasn't necessarily  Well known at the time  And I think that's why it was rewarded  And I think what's fun with this movie  Is it's really, you know, a guy's point of view  Of what does it mean to be a dad  Definitely  And it is kind of unapologetic that way  I mean, there's not a mom in the movie  It's really sort of from that point of view  And I think as a result  Audiences and everyone's really liking it  Because I think, to your point  If you work from that place 
[03:13:00]  Of trying to make sure there's something for everyone  It's just lame  And it's also like you see  And you don't see often  This real transition  That I think happens with a lot of guys  That they're used to just being a schlub  And being lazy  And getting by day to day  And not taking care of their apartment  Or whatever  And then when this sort of idea of fatherhood  Becomes a real thing  They're like  I have a person that I'm raising  And they completely turn their lives around  Yeah, and I think with him  What's interesting is  It's less  Well, you've never seen this before 
[03:13:30]  Really where  Usually in these movies  The guy says  Oh, I got it  The girl says  You have to be this person  The guy says  Oh, you're right  I have to become someone  That I don't like  Yeah  It's not what happens  So it's very different from that  It's not like a normal romantic comedy  Where the guy has to accept  What she says is the right thing to do  Right, he finds it in himself  Like he's just like  This is who I am  Yeah, this is me  Yeah, and I think that that's sort of  I think that's what's kind of  You know, separates it  And even Chris Platt's character  I think his relationship  You never really see the girl he's with 
[03:14:00]  But I think his point of view on that  And what's going on  Like she takes pleasure in sleeping with guys  That he doesn't like  And, you know, I think that that relationship  Is really kind of, you know, not what you normally see  In these kinds of movies  Definitely  It's very  It's an atypical movie  In the sense that it's not  There's not sort of any format to it  It's not a cookie cutter of anything else  I don't think  Yeah, and it could be  It could be  But that's what I think makes it kind of appeal to everyone  Is I think you can tell it's kind of authentic  You're not trying to go out there and say  Hey, we're going to be safe for everybody  It is a little politically incorrect 
[03:14:30]  Yeah  And it is sort of from a guy's point of view  And I think that's what makes it feel real  And that's what I mean  Like it is  It feels like a real guy  You know, and this real guy going through this transition  You mentioned swingers  And I was wondering  How quickly after swingers comes out  Does the  We're looking for a Vince Vaughn type  Start to appear  Yeah, I don't know  I mean  What was fun about swingers was  You know, when John wrote that script  It was sort of, you know  Based on dialogue and stuff that we had said 
[03:15:00]  And experiences but exaggerated, you know  What I liked about it was  We were just trying to do something that we believed in  We were just saying  This is a fun story that we really like  And we had a lot of pressure from people to say  You know, we'll make your movie  But there's got to be a girl's perspective  Or there's got to be this  And we thought, why?  I mean, that's not  That doesn't seem like a story we were interested in  So I had no idea anyone would ever see the movie  We were just really kind of passionate  To tell the story that we believed in  Yeah  And so it was really kind of surprising  I mean, we loved it  And we really believed in it  But it was one of those things that over time 
[03:15:30]  I think people found it  And it really had staying power  And I think a lot of that reason is because  Again, we worked from a place of  Let's just try to be truthful about  You know, and funny about  What this experience is like  Without going in trying to make everyone happy  And as far as the Vince Vaughn vehicle  I did a bunch of, you know, more dramatic films  And independent films at that time  That were really well-received  And then when Old School came about  With Todd Phillips  The studio didn't want me originally for that  They didn't know that I could be funny 
[03:16:00]  Because they had forgotten  Well, even with Swingers  It's like that's kind of a grounded movie  It's funny, but it's not  Over the top  Obvious, yeah  So Todd with Old School  That was a really fun movie  Because we were kind of defiant there as well  Were you specific after Swingers  That I want to do some dramatic roles for a while  Because that's when you did  You know, The Lost World  And The Psycho Remake  And very sort of  Well, Lost World was more of just like a big, fun movie  That was fun to get a chance to play  I mean, you have to understand  Coming from Swingers  The budget of the craft service of the food  In Lost World was bigger than we had for that movie 
[03:16:30]  So it was just crazy to play in that genre  Of course, Spielberg is there  Yeah, exactly  So, you know, it was less  I just was doing, you know, even Clay Pigeons or Return to Paradise  And those kind of character movies were fun  And I didn't like a lot of the studio fair, to be honest  And with the comedy, the stuff that started to come about  That was kind of this art comedy  Or those kinds of movies felt more fun to me  And now it's like with this movie, with Delivery Man  It feels like what feels fun is going back and doing something  That's a little less trying to please everybody  And you find, too, that whenever you do stuff 
[03:17:00]  That I feel like you kind of change the way a whole generation of guys  Who think that they're funny talk  Like, I don't know if it's bizarre for you  But do you find that you watch people talk  And you're like, he's just doing me from this movie  Or he's just doing me from Swingers  I guess it's more like picking up that, you know, expressions  Or things that we had said in the movies  Yeah  Like sayings and stuff has  And that was weird at first  Like when you would turn on ESPN  And they would say, he's so money and doesn't even know it 
[03:17:30]  Yeah  There was no concept of that  We were just, you know, having dialogue specific  That would be funny, that would make us laugh  So there wasn't a plan  And then, you know, earmuffs or something from old school  That's what I'm saying  It's still happening  Like, earmuffs is a thing that's in the vernacular now  Yes  And people just say it without even knowing that that's where it came from  That's true  But there was never a...  We didn't know like, hey, okay  Okay, we gotta really come up with this catch phrase  But yeah, those things have stuck around  Which I find to be, you know, kind of interesting  But... 
[03:18:00]  But you don't even think too  Like that sort of fast-paced way of talking  And like joke, joke  But is that really a joke?  But now he's moving on to the next thing  Like, you know...  It's pretty good  But you don't think that that is also...  I've known guys that they're talking like that  And I'm going...  Yeah  You just pinched this...  Like your whole way of being out of a movie  Yeah, could be  I haven't...  I've noticed more like the sayings and stuff  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah  For sure  You came out and said you're a Ron Paul conservative  Yes  I have to ask... 
[03:18:30]  Have you always been a conservative?  Has that always kind of been where you've been?  Well, when I say that I mean sort of...  I'm a big fan of Ron Paul  And sort of that the purpose of government is really to protect the individual's liberty  Yeah  But conservatism in Hollywood is not generally well-received  I find  Yeah  Did you have to wait until you...  You know, people who know me have known my beliefs forever  I think it's like...  You know, I have a good group of friends and even people that I work with  You know, you don't try to jam your stuff down people's throats every day 
[03:19:00]  Or vice versa  You know, you don't want to be around...  I don't want to be around some gas bag who's gonna...  Right  You know, every day tell me why he's right about something  But you know, I think people respect you  You're honest about how you feel about stuff  And you have real conversations about it  You know, I think like any group of people  Not everyone's gonna agree on everything  But, you know, you have a dialogue about it and talk about it  But I haven't found that it's really kind of...  It hasn't been anything for me that, you know, not agreeing with stuff  That's never made me feel nervous or intimidated 
[03:19:30]  And, you know, for the most part, you know, we can laugh about it  Really see stuff differently  So what you were talking...  I found it interesting when you were talking about swingers  Being sort of something you were doing because you thought it was good  And it's something you wanted to share  And then you said that the old school was like that  Is that sort of been an overarching theme for a long time?  Is that how you just...  Not always, no  I mean, we started off that way  Like you have to understand when we did swingers  It was, you know, we were sort of out of work actors  Yeah  John had an idea for this movie and wrote it  I actually said we should write something in verses waiting to go 
[03:20:00]  And be in stuff that older people are writing that may not really...  We don't think is fun  So John wrote this and it took him a short time  Because it was sort of based on a real experience  Which is going through a breakup  And we just went on a journey to get it made  And we refused to change it  And there was no plan except we really think this is fun  And then we kind of did the same thing with Made  Which was the first movie I produced that John directed  And that was a great place to work from  And then I think what happens is sometimes  You start getting into these bigger studio films 
[03:20:30]  And a lot of times when you sign up for the film  They'll say, yeah, yeah, we want to do it this way  We want to be edgy  We want to do this  And you say, great, I call it the honeymoon period  And then you wake up on the set and it's not what they want to do  They want to start to work towards the middle  And again, as an actor, you know, you don't have a lot of power  I mean, you go there and you play that part  But ultimately it's a director's medium  They're the ones who sort of decide on the tone  And what they do with the movie  When were you able to start letting go? 
[03:21:00]  Because I would imagine at least in the beginning  It would drive you crazy  That's my best shit that's not in the movie  You know, I think being involved in the process with swingers  And stuff early, you can appreciate it  And it just depended on the project  It's like when I did the breakup, that was my idea  So I was much more defiant to say that, you know, I don't want them to end up together at the end  The whole point of the movie was that  Why is every romantic comedy have to be that they are perfect for each other?  Sometimes you date someone you like, but you're not 
[03:21:30]  You shouldn't be with each other  So it just depends on how much I'm involved in early or not  But I think, you know, you want to give someone else  If you sign up, you're saying yes to a journey with them  And ultimately, you want to support them  Because it's not easy to be in that position  That's what's great with this director, Ken Scott  We're doing this movie that Steve Conrad, who wrote  Pursuit of Happiness, wrote with Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco  And I really like his tone and his taste 
[03:22:00]  And so it's, if you find someone that you like  It's a much easier process to kind of give yourself over to them  Well, Delivery Man is a movie that's out on Friday  And I wonder, this is all you  Like you said, there is no real, I mean, there's a female in it  But not her perspective  You're in, I think, every scene  Just about, yeah  But Colby Smulders is pretty great in the movie  She's fantastic  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But, is that intimidating for you?  Like, when you're reading the script and be like  Okay, like, this is me, me, me, me, me  I gotta make sure the audience doesn't mind my face  Yeah  Well, you know, I just kind of approach it where you try to go into each scene 
[03:22:30]  For me, I always try to be honest with what's happening  So, you kind of go in and kind of commit to what's going on  And you just sort of stay present with what's in front of you  I don't really try to think about all of it too much as I'm going through it  That's not your call anyway, really  Yeah, but I think it's important that you, as an actor, that you are prepared  And that when you go in there that you are trying to allow yourself to feel whatever comes up  That you're not trying to force an emotion across the screen  I hate that if someone's like trying to convey, oh, I'm upset or I'm sad 
[03:23:00]  I think it's, you know, a better place to work from if you go in there and you don't know what's going to happen  I mean, there was times I got choked up and times that my character got angry and stuff  And it was just sort of from the circumstance  You just let it go  You just let it go  You didn't do the sort of overpowering, like, eyes into the camera  Well, the movie delivery man, out Friday, Vince Vaughn  Thank you so much for being here  Great to be with you, I appreciate it  It's been a pleasure, thank you  Thank you  The ONA show continues, sort of, next 
[03:23:30]  This is after ONA Live  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues  This is after ONA Live  I gotta testify  Nice  E-Rock, you are so money and you don't even know it  Thank you, sir  866-WOW1-WOW  After Opie and Anthony Live  We'll get to Kanye West in a minute  How about Vince Vaughn?  On after Opie and Anthony Live 
[03:24:00]  Who saw that coming?  Finally, the after show is getting some A-listers rolling through here  Yeah, that's right, that's money  Have you seen swingers rolling?  I have  You have, okay  Of course you did  Of course you did  I was, uh  I was super happy to get Vince Vaughn in here  It was  He was a little more subdued than I expected  He seems like  I thought he was gonna be this goofy, sort of jokey  I guess I thought he was gonna be the guy who owns a bunch of speaker cities from old school 
[03:24:30]  I think he becomes that once he gets comfortable  You think so?  Like on Letterman, he's that guy  Or is he putting it on for Letterman because he's on television  It could be, but I think once he gets comfortable  It seemed like he really takes acting seriously  And I didn't necessarily  Not that he doesn't take what he does seriously  But I thought he was goofing around a little more I guess  You forget that he spent, after swingers, he spent all that time doing dramatic roles  He was in the Psycho remake for God's sake 
[03:25:00]  Are you writing about the earmuffs too?  The earmuffs? Yeah  That's the thing, I was surprised that he didn't pick up on the fact  Because it's always driven me crazy that you meet guys now  Who think that they're funny  Like young guys  My age, this generation  Who think that like, yeah I'm a funny guy because  I talk like Vince Vaughn does in movies  And then you meet Vince Vaughn and Vince Vaughn doesn't even talk like Vince Vaughn does in movies  Nobody actually talks like that  You know, where you're just kinda  Shooting out one-liners and trying to figure out where you're going and everything 
[03:25:30]  Nobody actually talks like that  It always drives me crazy when you meet people that do  But, he was right in the sense that  Like, you're so money  Nobody heard that before swingers  And now, it went right from swingers to sports center  And sports play-by-play  That is money!  Mm-hmm  And it became a thing  And earmuffs too  People, earmuffs rolling  They don't even remember where it came from 
[03:26:00]  And then this new one  They'll probably do  When he's trying to get a loan  Well, yeah  It was so fun  His movie is Delivery Man  And it's out in theaters Friday, which is tomorrow  It's the one  I think O&A might have made fun of it  But it's the one  I think we might have watched the trailer  Where he has a whole bunch of kids  Through the sperm bank  But I went to see this screening  With Roland  And it's always fun going to screenings with Roland  Because at some point he's going to fall asleep 
[03:26:30]  And it's no reflection on the film  I did fall asleep in Gravity  Maybe not...  Well, Gravity was a short movie though  Fair?  Plus you had your 3D glasses on  So nobody could see your eyes  So I don't vouch for that story one bit  I had two lattes before  Plus there's that one in the afternoon  Oh, that's the big difference  Because we went to see Delivery Man at like 6  Like in the evening  For our Hollywood big shot private screening advance  And Roland 
[03:27:00]  I realized something about Roland while I was there  Your laugh  Like brings me more real joy  Than almost anything in life  When you laugh  It's so real and jovial  That I feel like a better person  Just hearing it  At one point, Roland is asleep in the theater  Yeah, you were asleep  Sound asleep  Like I heard snoring  That's a key 
[03:27:30]  Well, Roland's done  And it was early in the movie  So I was like, okay  I guess I'm...  I guess I'm watching this on my own  I'm fine with that  I don't talk during movies anyway  But...  He goes from snoring  There's a shit joke  On the screen  I don't even remember what the shit joke was  But he literally  He kicks up from snoring  When the shit joke is said in the movie  And just...  And he laughed  At the shit joke  And I look at him like  Where did that come from? 
[03:28:00]  You were asleep  Did...  Did...  Do the shit jokes  Infect your...  Your REM cycles?  Yeah, they made me laugh  How did that...  How did that get to you while you were sleeping?  I was like...  Shit joke  Nick in Tennessee  Prime time  What's up buddy?  I didn't even know that was Vince Vaughn  I like...  I started listening halfway through  Isn't it weird that he doesn't...  He doesn't...  Sound like Vince Vaughn 
[03:28:30]  Like when he's actually...  I was expecting...  You know, the guy from Swingers  But slightly older  He sounds like the guy from Breakup  When he was doing a serious talk to Jennifer Aniston  That's the voice  Nobody...  Breakup with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn  I love them  Hey, one more thing buddy  Uh...  Did E-Rock set that all up today?  Set what all up?  Just getting Vince Vaughn in there  No, E-Rock did not  Oh, well fuck anyways  No, E-Rock  Well... 
[03:29:00]  I mean, to be fair E-Rock's not a talent booker, so...  I think he's...  He said yes or no  He was waiting for that key to say that word  He didn't care  He just wanted to bring up E-Rock  Well...  I did have the opportunity...  Of course we came back with Kanye West just now  That E-Rock brought to us  And...  I did have the opportunity to spend some more time with Roland  And try to get some of that joy  That I need for my soul  Do people like...  Generally...  When...  When you hang out with people  Do they like...  Trying to get you to laugh and just... 
[03:29:30]  Is there a lot of depression around you?  No...  There isn't, is there?  No...  It's all jovialness and parties and...  Yeah, if I see people fall, I laugh  I think that's why Roland can say the shittiest stuff to people  He says...  Horrible, mean things to people  But he can get away with it  Because there's just something about...  Your laugh that's...  Well, it's Roland, it's lovable  Yeah, people should move out of my way  It hurt them  And then you giggle a little bit  And you go, oh, okay  Are you aware that you have that... 
[03:30:00]  No...  Power?  No...  You're not?  Mm-mm...  You're just like, I just...  You're a natural buffoon  Yeah...  And you'll act that way  Yes...  And just see what happens  Yeah, just go about my day  I like that...  It's a very good...  It's a very good way to be...  Were you happy with Vince Vaughn?  Yeah, I love him  Yeah, he's the man  Last night, Roland and me went to see Kanye West's Yeezus tour  Yeah...  You're not a Kanye West fan  I am not 
[03:30:30]  So what were you doing going to Yeezus?  I want to see what all the hubbub was about  Anytime there's any hype, Roland's gotta be a part of it  It was the same way when the Jets signed Tim Tebow  Who was the first guy to walk into this building with a New York Jets Tim Tebow t-shirt?  I had the t-shirt and then that Sunday I went front row 50 yard line  Hot off the presses from Models, you had it right away  Right away  As soon as the Brooklyn Nets announced their new logo and said we're putting out merch and it comes out today 
[03:31:00]  You had it  Sign me up  You always have to be whatever is like cool going on  You want to say, oh no, I'd like to be a little part of that  Let's see what's up  You just want to see what's up  Yes  So we went to see Yeezus last night  That's Kanye West's tour  And...  What did you think, Roland?  I was very confused  You were?  Yes  Speaking of confused, Snowy in Michigan has a suggestion  What's up, Snowy?  Hey, Samuel, how are you doing?  Good 
[03:31:30]  Ah, we need to invent an app to translate Roland  You have no idea what he's saying?  A couple of times when he made a story about Fall Hill waking up  It's like what, it's like what Ant said  If they can't see him as if this is a movie  What?  He activated, makes his laugh  It activates the app  Maybe something like that, Roland?  Yeah, go for it  I love you, Roland  Don't get me wrong, man  I'm not dissing you, man  Roland is right now, his eyes are darting back and forth  And that means that he's trying to figure out whether he's going to still be lovable or turn into evil, venomous Roland 
[03:32:00]  He can't...  Oh, Roland, we love you, man  That's part of your charm, dude  Thank you, Steve Jobs  What?  Steve Jobs?  He said invent an app  He said invent an app  Invent an app  The problem with Roland is that his thought process is as convoluted as his speech patterns are  Even if you translate directly what he's saying, it still makes no sense  Thanks, Snowy  No, thanks, man  I'll take you later 
[03:32:30]  So, we went to see Yeezus, you said you were confused  Yeah, I mean, there's a massive mountain  Yeah  Monsters  Kanye West has put together this show that is...  It's pageantry  It's obscene, the level of showmanship  It's like going to see a show  It's like a Broadway show  It is  It is  There were a lot of celebrities there  Tons  We saw Misha Barton in the audience  Jack White 
[03:33:00]  Was in the special  There's like a celebrity bleacher section  That I got to kind of sneak over to  And...  It was...  There's a lot of people there  Take a photo, but...  Kanye puts on this show  And Roland and me were able to sit up close  Because the people at the Barclays love us  They're the...  They're the shit  They are  The Barclays really treat it as well  Yeah, and I love the Barclays  I have to see concerts  But it was like...  Kanye West  And it's the weirdest thing  Because I'm...  Tweeting pictures from the show 
[03:33:30]  And the internet can't stop talking about how much they hate this dude  Yeah  What a fucking asshole  Oh, what a piece of shit  And...  But he's got arenas full of people going  Ah!  We love you!  And then for three minutes  He got them all going  Yeezus!  Yeezus!  Yeah, he's just having them chant his name  But not actually his name  Yeah  The name that makes him sound like he's Jesus Christ  And it's not like he's standing up  He's laying down  He was  At one point he was laying down on the stage 
[03:34:00]  Once...  Four times  You were looking at him enviously?  Enviously?  I was like...  He was like laid down and people just going nuts  And you were stuck standing  I was like man  Using all your leg muscles  I'm a genius  Yeah  Lay down and be like  Yeezus!  Yeezus!  But everybody on the internet is going  Oh, that son of a bitch  He does this thing where he comes out  I don't even know where to begin  It was such a spectacle  Yeah  It was...  The biggest spectacle I've seen in a long time  Like...  He gives Lady Gaga a run for her money  In terms of what he's doing with this show 
[03:34:30]  Can we get made reviews if this is a Broadway show?  But I probably would also need to work on figuring out the central theme  Like there probably needs to be some kind of focus  The monster  The monster  So...  He comes out on stage  And...  He's followed by...  Probably fifteen women  Who are wearing full body pantyhose nude suits and masks  Yeah...  Like pantyhose over their heads  So you can tell they're women 
[03:35:00]  But they have no defining features  And they're following him around  And at some point  He's singing  Or rapping  And they're behind him  And they're slow motion fake fighting each other  And Roland's looking at me like  Can you explain this?  And I go  No, Roland  I don't know what's going on  Come to find out  They all finish fighting  And they stop their poses  And they've created a throne 
[03:35:30]  Yeah...  And Kanye West then just sits down  On like the fifteen women  As if they're just his furniture  Yeah...  And then continues his show  Yeah...  He built a mountain  To put on stage  And he's going from spot to spot  At one point  He's singing  He's rapping  Sitting on a bunch of women  At one point  The mountain was probably  How tall do you think?  At least two stories  Maybe three?  Yeah, it was huge  Maybe a three story mountain is on stage  He climbs to the very top of the mountain 
[03:36:00]  So he can sing a song on top of the mountain  On top of everybody  By the monster  I mean to say  That this guy has a  Has a Jesus complex  Not only does he name his tour  And his album Yeezus  But he was looking out on this crowd  Like I am your lord and savior  I'm at the top of the mountain  I'm way above all of you  And just worship me  And everybody is worshiping him  Yeah...  And then they have the  The real church  The incense  The incense  Hmm? 
[03:36:30]  The incense  Remember they came with the cross  And the  They started moving the incense to smoke  Yeah, there was all  They started smoking  There was all this religious paraphernalia  That I didn't know  I didn't know what any of it meant  Yeah, it was all  Catholic stuff  He must have been raised  I doubt he was Catholic  He's a black guy  He's probably some kind of Christian though  Um  Yeah, it was  It's quite the spectacle  Yeah, and  At one point the stage is tilted up  And he's laying down on it  And he's  And he's 
[03:37:00]  Whatever  He sang a whole song laying down  Mama  Yeah, this is for my you mama  Yeah, this is for my you mama  Do you think the song was called Mama?  I thought it was  Because he goes, this is for you mama  I was like, oh, I guess it's called Mama  He dedicated a song to his dead mom  While he was laying down  And then  We thought that the stage crew  Was coming on stage  Because then the stage had to flatten out  But it wasn't the stage crew Roland  No  It was a monster  Yes  It was some  It was a woman  Dressed up as a monster  A big fur coat  And red light up eyes 
[03:37:30]  There were lights shining down  That looked like holograms  Less like lights  And more like holograms  Yeah  That's like Tron  And then  It wasn't even like the stage crew  Was  The monster  No they didn't  The monster stayed  Yeah  The monster stayed for like  Four more songs  Just chilling up in a mountain  And one of the priests guys  Had to lift a heavy  His heavy machine up  What was it?  Which heavy machine?  The one with the ding  Oh, his drum machine  Yeah, the guy was struggling 
[03:38:00]  He seemed like  Yeah, he did one of his songs  Like he used the drum machine live  Like you know how rappers  When they make beats  They don't actually use instruments  They use a drum machine  He was doing it live  That was cool  But then  To top everything off  He does  75% of the show  He goes through like  Four or five costume changes  Which is  I mean  You don't see that  You definitely don't see it  At rap shows  But you don't see it at rock shows  Generally when dudes  Perform music  Unless you're Prince or somebody  Yeah 
[03:38:30]  You're not going through  Four costume changes  But he's going through  All his costume changes  Right?  And  75% of the concert  And he probably performs  For two and a half hours or so  He's got on  A jeweled mask  And he's got like  Four or five different masks  I couldn't count  The first one looks like  A Mexican wrestler  You thought so?  Gold, yeah  Because it was like gold and rubies  Yeah  I put one on my Instagram  I'll probably put a couple more later  But like one was gold 
[03:39:00]  And one was black  And one was white  But they totally covered his face  Yeah  And so Jess came with us  My wife  And she's like  I'm kind of annoyed  That you can't even see his face  But he did this  He orchestrated this so well  That 75% of the way into the show  He takes this mask off  And reveals his face  And the whole building erupts  Like this  Look at this gift we've been given  We can finally see  The beautiful face of Kanye West 
[03:39:30]  It was the most insane thing  I'd ever seen  Well because he goes  Hello by Jesus  And then Jesus touched him  Well of course  That was the  That was the icing on the cake  And then that's when he took off  To perform Jesus walks  He actually had Jesus Christ himself  Come out on stage  And bless him  And then Kanye could take off  His bejeweled mask  Then all the hits came  And then he started doing his hits  Those are the ones that you knew  And you won  So what did you think  Seeing this spectacle  At one point 
[03:40:00]  All the nude suit women  That were like androgynous  Held him up  Like it looked  Yeah  There were many points  In that concert  That it kind of felt like  A scene out of Eyes Wide Shut  It was just  Weird  And sexual  But androgynous  At the same time  Also those up close cameras  Wherever they were at  On the stage  They had big faces projected  Like I always thought like  Hip hop was like  Street and tough  And this was  This was  Insane  It was quite the show 
[03:40:30]  He had a big  Circular video screen  Above this mountain  That would sometimes  Make it look like  It snowed  And then snow would come down  And then he would shine lights  On the mountain  And it would turn into a volcano  And then the mountain  Would split open  And the fire  Came out  Yeah  The fire was really hot  Though we were  Pretty close  Yeah the fire was hot  It's fire  Yeah and then the fire  Started coming up  Were you surprised  That the fire was hot?  And they come down Chachi  Let's fire  Garth in Indiana 
[03:41:00]  My mouth is dry  I need water  Brian in Texas  What?  Brian in Texas?  You there?  What?  This Brian?  Yeah Brian  I'm sorry about that  Hey isn't his first  First song off this album  Called The Holy Grail?  Uh no  It was  That was Jay Z's album  Oh yeah  He's got the same shit  Going on too  Yeah but 
[03:41:30]  Probably to a lesser extent  I mean this  Totally different  Yeah this was like  A whole thing happening  And I guess  I guess at every show  I was  I didn't know what he was doing  With the masks  Because people were around us  Trying to get annoyed  Like  Yeah  We wanna see his face  If we're gonna be here  Watching him perform  Or is it  Or was it Kanye?  Right  Could it be a mystery man?  But he orchestrated it to the point  Where I guess 
[03:42:00]  I guess when you're in front of him  You don't hate him  Because  There's no way  Like I don't hear  When I'm  On the internet  Or on  Other forms of media  Television  Or whatever  I don't hear people  Talking about Kanye West being great  Like  Very often  At all  Everybody talks about what an asshole he is  Right?  But  At these shows  He's doing  He did two nights at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn  Here in New York  He's doing another two nights at Madison Square Garden  He's filled all of them up 
[03:42:30]  I can tell you from the show I went to  There was not one naysayer in the building  Would you say that Roland?  Yeah  They were just saying  Jesus and Jova  Jova?  Oh was it  Jova?  It was Hova is what they were chanting  Oh that's it  And did you notice they were singing along?  Oh they're  I mean I've never seen so many people drop in bombs around me  Like the business guys in suits just like raising their hands  White guys?  Yeah  That's what it seemed like 
[03:43:00]  It did to me  It felt like watching all the white guys in their business suits  Cause Roland and the people at the Barclays helped us out  And got us these great standing spots in the VIP section  But the VIP section is not real fans  Like the VIP section is all people who wear suits to work  Yeah  And like kind of secretly like Kanye West because it's cool  But it was totally  Like I totally felt like  I'm in public  And I can yell the N word?  That's how they were all  That's what they were all thinking 
[03:43:30]  There's one time we went  And then and then and then  And then the guy next to me was like  And then and then  Like right  I was like whoa  Yeah like are you sure?  There's like three black people in the section  So we just all had to wait until they were kind of away  Here's what I did  Did you enjoy it?  I did  You did  Yeah I just was watching the spectacle  You looked so confused most of the time  I was cause I the monster confused me  The monster really did it for you  And then the naked or when he's walking  You think he's leaving then he stops  Then he runs right back and starts rapping 
[03:44:00]  The one part where I think he lost a lot of the audience  Was in the middle of the show  He stops and he gets to do just a monologue  And you can tell it's not scripted  And a whole bunch of them have ended up on YouTube  These are the things that end up on TMZ  And he talks about Obama or whoever he talks about  Bruno Mars being pretty  Right and so he stops the music and he starts talking  And he just starts talking about award shows 
[03:44:30]  Cause if you remember Kanye West had some controversy about award shows  But he goes on to this whole monologue  First talking about how pissed off he is that Bruno Mars keeps getting awards  And I was like what  I didn't even fathom that you would be bothered  By Bruno Mars  Who cares what Bruno Mars is doing  And he goes no  They're trying to give the prettiest motherfuckers all the awards  Cause they so damn pretty  And the people are like okay woo 
[03:45:00]  And they're like okay  But half the people  They were all like  Half the audience was white women  Yeah  Who all love Bruno Mars  They're like  I mean he's kinda good  I don't mind him so much  He's alright  And then I think what lost is when the guy  His tech guy tried to wrap him for  Cause uh  Well the tech guy goes okay  You know it's almost time to put the video back on  And he goes no  You ruined my train of thought  So he goes into another train of thought  He told him in his earpiece  So he goes on to another train of thought 
[03:45:30]  And he starts shitting on a whole bunch of Italian designers  Whose names nobody knew what he was talking about  Yeah he goes I can't get into this um  Blah blah blah fashion show  Donatelli of Valencia  Knows my shit  And we're all going  Who?  And then he goes  He names his crew  And he goes we went in there and bought shoes  And we're like  Yeah  We can't afford that  Yeah  We getting off the plane in Paris  Yeah  And we going to design pants 
[03:46:00]  Everybody's like  Alright so design pants in your own time  Yeah  And he goes  Chanel won't be  Put in my suit  It's going to be my name  Yeah  I'm like what's going on?  Chanel Guadalupe  Yeah  See what I can do  And won't give me the opportunity  Chanel won't give me the opportunity  I used to draw Nike Airs in my notebooks  And I was like okay  So he used to  In school  Yeah he started going on  When I was in high school  I used to draw pictures of Jordans  In my notebook  I was like okay  I think maybe  Maybe 
[03:46:30]  The Led Zeppelin logo  Might have been more common  Probably from my generation  You know the Yeezus  The Korn logo  With the R backwards  Something  But no okay  Nike Air  Jordans  His shoes  But your shoes are no longer available  Yeah we can't get your shoes dude  Don't throw them  They cost like $800  Yeah  I got a little  Right there  I was like what's going on?  You're like  Back to that ding song  Ding  Ding  It was  It was  I mean Bruce  Sometimes will interrupt  Springsteen will interrupt a concert  To talk right? 
[03:47:00]  No he has that one point  And then he goes on  That's it  It would just  But it'll be like  Oh okay I know what he's saying  Yeah but  If I like feed the charity banks  And help out  And this and that  It won't be like  They won't give me the opportunity  To design more sneakers  I don't think Bruce Everett goes  I land a plane  And all my people  We go buy clothes  I got a great idea  For a new shirt  And nobody's letting me design it  Yeah that was a weird one  About the shoes 
[03:47:30]  I'm like what's going on?  That was the one  Where even the fans  Were starting to go like  How long is he gonna go with this?  I think that's why  They try to wrap him up again  They're like go back  Yeah  I wanna design socks for a living  Well you got a great job  We paid to  Watch you  Perform music  I don't know why  You keep talking about  Socks  Yeah that was a weird one  Rich in Florida  Yeah I think you  You and Roland  Just gave credence  To why everybody says  That his music sucks 
[03:48:00]  Y'all just spent  The past 20 minutes  Talking about his concert  And never once said  Talked about how the concert  Was awesome  The stage production  Blah blah blah  But never once mentioned  Any songs  Or anything like that  Yeah  And I think that's why  People say his music sucks  I don't think anybody  Challenges the fact  That he's an entertainer  And listening to y'all  Would if it said  Kanye was gonna be  At that concert  And doing a concert  And he didn't show up 
[03:48:30]  But he had somebody else  Up there  With all the theatrics  And somebody doing his songs  Do you think that it still  Would have been exciting?  No I mean  Everybody would have known  That it was lame  You can't substitute an artist  But  But you know what I'm saying  Right?  You know what I'm saying  But that's like saying  If you found a great cover band  Like if you found an excellent  Whatever  Brother Joe  Does a great U2 cover band  And it sounds like U2 
[03:49:00]  Right?  But if you go see a U2 concert  And 2U shows up  You're kinda like  Yeah the songs sound good  But this is not what I paid to see  Right  And well  And I was saying  You know Kanye arguing about  Shouldn't really have to  Listen to y'all  Kanye should get a Tony award  More so than I  Okay that's something  That's something I can go with  Cause you're right  And I think  I think that's probably a problem  That before anybody can talk about  What Kanye West has going on  They have to get through  Several layers 
[03:49:30]  Before they can even think about  Talking about the songs  Right  He interrupted his concert  To complain about  Not getting to design sweaters  Yeah  Like  Have you ever been to a show  Where  Where a guy  Stops his music  To announce to the audience  I don't understand  Why people in Italy  Won't let me design pants  My favorite  The shoe store  That cracked me out  Oh no  And then for Kanye West  To ask Bruno Mars  Who can actually sing 
[03:50:00]  It doesn't  It's not auto-tuned  You gotta admit though Rich  Bruno Mars is a pretty little  Motherfucker isn't he  He's a pretty little  Motherfucker  But that's a little  Four-footer  He can damn  Carry it too  Alright thanks Rich  But I love when he just  Rolled off a name  Like Dean  Tommy  Gene  We all about shoes  Yeah he started talking about  His plane landing in Paris  Thousands and thousands  And his whole crew  Getting off the plane  And everybody in Paris  Knowing that they're here  To design shoes 
[03:50:30]  And then he mentioned his crew  By name  And everybody's going like  So is he gonna do  Jesus walks  Or is he  We're just gonna talk about shoes  Did you enjoy the show?  Nicole from the morning mashup  Is here  I did  Very much so  It was  I was telling Roland  It was just such a spectacle  Okay  It was amazing  Yeah  Oh wow  I was looking at pictures right now  I mean he's  It is a spectacle  It's like a freaking circus  Yeah it was like a circus  Except a circus where  The ringmaster  Believes himself to be a deity  Well you know that about him though 
[03:51:00]  Yeah but I like that  You won  I enjoyed that  He has  Gone to this extent  Where he knows  What are you doing over there?  I'm sorry  The mic just came loose  It's tricky  I know  I know  We'll teach you broadcasting one day  Thanks  Are you high?  I am not high  Okay no I just wanna know  I wish  I wish very much  You're pregnant  You can't be  He's gotten to the point though  Where he's pissed off so many people 
[03:51:30]  Yeah  That he just keeps going  And going  I don't know if you heard about this  But we were talking about it a minute ago  His big  He did 75% of the show  He's wearing a mask  Yeah and it looks like an S&M mask  Yes  Is it an S&M mask?  Except it's got jewels on it  Oh  Like it's a really expensive S&M mask  And there's no mouth  Or eyes  Or nose  I think it was Chanel  The white one  Yeah?  Chanel  I'm sure it's Givenchy knowing him  I don't know what that is  Exactly  Like I don't know  Yeah Givenchy sounds like one of those designers that won't let him make pants 
[03:52:00]  Yeah  You're right  He's to me  I just I look at him now  And I'm just like you're a little bitch  Whoa  Whoa  He's a little bitch  That  Jesus  And I'll say cause I don't even ever wanna interview him  Cause I just think he's a little bitch  I would interview him and I would be like  Can I have 6 hours to talk to you?  Exactly  Like I would just wanna sit in a room with him and be like  So what do you think of  Yeah  And just let him talk shit about something  Did you feel as uncomfortable watching this new video with Kim as I did?  Like I thought it was like a joke  It was like a spoof  Of her gyrating on that fake motorcycle with the fake scenery behind it 
[03:52:30]  It made me nauseous  He did make a weird video  Look I'm a Kanye West fan  Me too  That's why  I'm so annoyed that he's acting like a little bitch  Jesus  That's how I feel  I like it  Okay  I like the severity of what you're saying  Don't be sorry  Don't ever be sorry  Billy in Brooklyn  What's up Sam Rock?  Hey  Kanye is substantially different now  Compared to the Kanye you know rapping on the Chappelle show wearing a backpack  You know?  Yeah he used to rap about getting fired from his job at the Gap  Exactly 
[03:53:00]  So there had to have been a catalyst in between then and now to cause this blowout  I mean he's like off the hinge  He's a performance artist  So what do you think happened?  I don't know  I think that somewhere along the line  His  Cause when he first came out and he was rapping with backpacks and wearing pants that fit  Yeah  It was different  Yes it was  Like nobody was doing that then  And I feel like he has just gone full force  I have to reinvent everything and do everything  I just have to flip the script on everything 
[03:53:30]  Just be totally different  And at points it's like the opposite of what people expect  Therefore it's the opposite of what people want  When you get famous the worst thing you can ever do is start to believe your own bullshit  And he believes his own bullshit now  Yeah but he believes his own bullshit before he was famous too  Like when he came before he was famous he was like  Don't you guys know?  I'm the motherfucking shit  It's true  I'm the best  And everybody was like no you're not  Yeah  So then he becomes famous  And he goes I told you I was going to become famous  And they're like yeah but you're not the best 
[03:54:00]  And then he arguably becomes one of the best  And so now it's really like fuck everyone  Yeah  He even has a confederate flag t-shirt  Yeah and then he claims that he owns the confederate flag now  First of all I don't know why he has a confederate flag t-shirt  T-shirt  T-shirt  You got a Stanley T in here don't you?  And then his mom dies Kanye West  Yeah  And so she doesn't  There's not even a mother there to ground him  He's just like whatever  I'm the fucking man  I don't think she grounded him  I think she's like yeah baby go on  Yeah  Go on
