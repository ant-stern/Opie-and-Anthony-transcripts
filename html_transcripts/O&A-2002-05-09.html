<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from a Philadelphia WYSP studio centered around a "Strangest Thing" contest, offering a Kid Rock meet-and-greet and other prizes as rewards.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with co-host Jim Norton (mentioned in a later segment), heavily criticized the studio's layout, believing it disadvantaged them in favor of guests.  The contest entries were extraordinarily bizarre, ranging from a jar containing a Vietnamese ear (the owner initially lacked ID) and a jar of feces supposedly from a homeless person, to a cat skull, a pig testicle and tail, and even a contestant's mother discarding his pickled cat fetuses.  Other entries included a pregnant pig uterus (dissected on air), a mummified monkey, a brother's umbilical cord,  a human brain affected by a stroke (examined by a medical student guest, Mike Pelagino), and a gallstone from a deceased mother.  One caller recounted possessing a human ear as a war souvenir from Vietnam.  Another caller described performing oral sex on a man in front of a large crowd, including his fifteen-month-old child.

The show featured numerous discussions about various topics, including Opie and Anthony's experiences with recording commercials (particularly Opie's creative, and sometimes problematic, methods). A significant portion debated the historical accuracy of a Black Minuteman depicted on a Revolutionary War school field trip, prompting various caller opinions.  Pat Croce, former Philadelphia 76ers executive, joined the show as a guest, discussing basketball, the 76ers, and his new extreme sport, Slam Ball.  The hosts also discussed a New York City mugger who masturbates in front of his victims.  Jim Norton contributed comedic bits related to this mugger and his own sexual experiences. A man with no belly button, Dave, due to a hernia operation at ten weeks old, was also a contestant.  Taylor, from a previous "Naughty Nighty" contest, was brought in, and the hosts arranged for her to expose her breasts to the crowd outside.  The broadcast also touched upon the upcoming Opie and Anthony Celebrity Softball game, with Octane mentioned as the warm-up band.  Ongoing technical difficulties with the outside microphone and frequent listener interaction, including booing directed at crew member Steve and repeated calls for Taylor to appear, were recurring elements.

A phone call from Megan concerning the "fake orgasm" contest failed due to technical issues.  Station manager Tim Sabian was in studio, discussing Kid Rock and a dinner invitation misunderstanding.  Steve-O from MTV's Jackass called in, discussing past drug use, his book, plans for a "butt chug" stunt, and his opposition to circumcision.  The broadcast's climax involved a bizarre event: two women engaging in explicit sexual acts on camera for foundrymusic.com, alongside a man performing a sex act with the dead monkey as part of the Kid Rock contest. The hosts and crew reacted with a mix of shock, disgust, and amusement, offering running commentary, punctuated by vulgar and offensive language and laughter.  The show concluded with further discussion of the Kid Rock concert and plans for a similar event in D.C. the following day.  Numerous listener calls provided diverse reactions to the events throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my goodness.  You remember that from yesterday, right?  How great was that?  How could you not remember that?  What was that? That 17-year-old girl from, um...  Virginia.  Virginia.  D.C., we're coming there tomorrow, baby.  But today, we are live in Philly at the studios of WYSP. 
[00:00:30]  Right.  And we're trying to get everything situated in the studio.  I don't know where Anthony is. I can hear him.  Oh, really?  He's around here somewhere.  I'll be over this big thing.  See this thing here?  Just look over it, see?  I see your hand as you're waving to me.  Let me get a little high.  Hey, what's up, bro?  Hey, we'll do the show like this.  I do believe someone with an ego built this studio because, yeah, because, uh, I don't know. 
[00:01:00]  All the attention is focused on the person sitting in my seat.  And trust me, I want to be sitting where Anthony is and Jim Norton.  You're like, uh, picture the bridge of the Enterprise.  You have Captain Kurt's chair.  Yeah.  And we are sitting at, uh, Sulu and Chekhov's post.  And then Ben is like where Uhura would be.  I see Rick kind of where Spock's, uh, station is.  But you, you are Captain Kirk.  It's completely ridiculous.  I can only see the top half, half of your heads. 
[00:01:30]  Well, when I mentioned it today, uh, they brought up, um, why it's designed this way.  And who designed it this way?  Right?  It was, uh, John DiBella, right?  Remember John DiBella?  People in Philly know John.  People in New York should know him.  Uh, he designed this studio.  And designed it so he is the focal point.  And for some reason, uh, the guests that he would have in the studio.  And everyone else is just the minions.  Are impossible to see.  Yeah.  Because he has this wall.  What's on the other side of this great wall? 
[00:02:00]  I think I could.  Are there phasers and photon torpedoes?  I think I could launch a space shuttle from here, Anthony.  Because I can't understand what this is.  It's, it's, it's completely ridiculous.  Let me, I'm, I'm actually taking it.  Yeah.  Look at these buttons.  What the hell?  Why are those there?  I don't know.  I, I got, I got.  What those should be to the side?  I got satellites.  I, I'm learning that, uh, an iceberg, uh, just broke off in North.  Are you getting, uh.  In Antarctica?  You're getting news updates?  It's ridiculous.  Plus you know.  Are you patched into the AP? 
[00:02:30]  Plus you notice I'm about 10 feet higher than you?  Yeah, you gotta be really high up.  God, what kind of ego did this guy have?  I had to find three or four chairs before I found one that even gets me up to a level  where I, I could see you.  You got a booster seat.  I need the booster seat at the restaurant.  The little plastic ones.  That they could hose down in, in case some kid goes wee-wee.  But, uh, we're, we're happy to be back in Philly.  We love, uh, when we come down to Philly.  Right, Anthony?  Yes.  There's already at least 100, 150 people outside the, uh, the station for our big contest today. 
[00:03:00]  And I, I took a peek out the window just before we went on the air.  Yeah.  And there's, uh, little Jimmy Norton tussling people's hair.  Were you tussling hair out there?  I gave a couple tussles, yeah.  He's gonna-  Imagine, imagine you just come to the studios and, uh, you just expect to maybe, maybe get a picture or something.  And instead you get a tussle from our own little Jimmy Norton.  Go home with your hair freshly tussled.  Just tussled, you're looking at, you don't want the wind to blow it, so you kind of walk slow.  So you can get home and go, my hair's been tussled. 
[00:03:30]  By little Jimmy.  It was ridiculous to see from above.  Were they asking you to tussle their hair?  No, I just saw some lad and his hair looked like it hadn't been tussled in quite a while.  We had to get shopping bags so they could stand in it and step down and go crinkle, crinkle and you could tussle.  Oh, it cost you five bucks and I tussle as you, you make one full turn in the bag as it crinkles.  In the bag, one confused little turn.  If you're crying, we throw in an extra turn for good measure while tussling. 
[00:04:00]  Wonderful, tussling hair.  They're all waiting out there.  Some of them do have strange items that they brought down because that's the contest.  And I'm hearing things, Opie.  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things that Philly is stepping right up.  They're not wasting any time.  They're not messing around down here.  They want to outdo Boston where a gentleman won for bringing down his own spleen, which had to be removed.  They want to beat out New York where our own doctor, one of our doctor's friends of the show, brought in a cancerous esophagus and then topped that with a cancerous breast. 
[00:04:30]  And he barely beat out the guy that brought in a pickled punk.  Pickled punk, which we just love.  We love the pickled punks.  I'm hearing maybe there might be something like a pickled punk downstairs.  Like a cat version of the pickled punk.  Cat fetuses.  Someone wants to eat a cat fetus.  I don't even know what's happening.  We're hearing things.  But I'm hearing that there's some war memorabilia that I'm very excited to see.  Let's just say some war memorabilia from the Vietnam era.  I think we're going to kick it off with this guy. 
[00:05:00]  Are we?  Oh, yeah.  Fantastic.  In a little while.  But we're doing the strangest thing you can bring down to WISP today here in Philly.  Fifth in market, of course.  And the winner, Anthony, is going to win a guitar signed by Kid Rock, a meet and greet with Kid Rock,  and front row seats to the Kid Rock show tonight in Philly.  I thought we were actually playing the contest yesterday in New York to bring the strangest thing down,  and some of the girls brought their bodies.  What an interesting little day we had yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show with our money snatch game. 
[00:05:30]  You know, after the show, I was talking to Sandy, and I go, San, you know what?  I've reached my quota.  I don't want to see girls naked anymore.  You don't, do you?  No.  It's not.  We've seen too many, Anthony.  You know, it's really great.  I think we've reached God's quota, you and I.  And now we're just getting like...  And now we're getting...  From now on, we're going to just be punished.  The cream is no longer at the top of the barrel.  We're way down at the bottom.  God will give you a few.  You know, he gives every guy, you know, I don't know, maybe a thousand opportunities to see naked girls. 
[00:06:00]  As soon as you reach that quota, though, something goes wrong, man.  God works in mysterious ways, Anthony.  You know what, Opie?  I think we were very lucky yesterday.  Considering we were coming to Philly and leaving New York last night, we had our respective girls with us at the studio yesterday.  So we could leave right from the show.  Right.  And what a banner day to have girlfriends on hand because they were witness, witness to the girls that come down to the show.  That our jobs aren't that easy.  Right.  It's not quite the breeze we make it sound like. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Is it?  So, and let me just say, there were a couple of very, very hot girls yesterday.  Oh, look at you being smart.  So now all the contestants from yesterday going, yeah, see, I was the hot one.  Of course.  The other ones were the messes.  They know who they are.  You're smart.  I'm smart.  You're smart.  They know who they are.  And if they could look in the mirror and assess themselves.  Dude, I would guarantee I could get all the contestants on the phone right now and every single one of them would say, I was the hot one. 
[00:07:00]  Opie, please don't.  Now that I've said what I've said, please don't.  I never want to speak to them again.  Please.  No, I thought they were very cool.  They were very cool.  The feedback on the show yesterday was just off the hook.  Although crying a chubby girl was a little much.  Do we have audio of that was a little much?  I forgot to grab it.  There are some instances you really don't want to be weeping.  And, lady, that was one of them. 
[00:07:30]  You really don't want to be completely naked after performing what we call the twist.  Have a fistful of damp dollars and just be weeping.  And saying, now I can give my daughter a birthday party.  A birthday party.  Oh, boy.  Now you can give your daughter the birthday party that she's wanted.  Yeah, that's...  Just please buy her a present and don't put cash in an envelope and give it to her.  Because she's probably much too young to have an STD. 
[00:08:00]  Wouldn't that be awful?  Come here, honey.  Look at my baby.  I'm able to give you money.  Oh, mommy, it smells.  The money would come in Luca Bronsi's vest.  Yeah, didn't that vest just look like it stunk?  Not even from the fish wrapped in it.  Just from Luca Bronsi's armpits being choked.  We have a lot of clips.  So maybe we can play them a little later.  Clips, right?  Okay, sorry. 
[00:08:30]  Well, considering some of the things we saw, I wasn't sure what you were saying.  Clips.  I got the same sore throat you got.  So maybe it didn't sound right.  What happened there?  I don't know what's going on here.  Look forward to the stuffy nose and sinus headache, Opie, which accompanies that.  It's really fun.  Thank you.  Thanks for passing it along.  I forgot my chloroceptic.  I forgot my chloroceptic back at the hotel room.  But Guinness works just as well.  Right.  You were blasting that all day yesterday.  I know.  I'm like, just spraying.  I hate chloroceptic.  My tongue's all like red. 
[00:09:00]  Numb.  Green, whatever color it is.  It doesn't work.  Just take echinacea and I'll leave.  You know what I don't like about chloroceptic?  And this is the God's honest truth.  You spray it in.  It hits the back of your throat and then right up by where you get the nasal drip type thing.  It numbs it out and numbs your mouth out.  And it started making me feel like I was doing coke.  Like I get that weird feeling in the back.  You know, people.  You know what I'm talking about.  All the drip down the back of your throat.  Yeah, like the drip.  And my nose and throat would kind of close up. 
[00:09:30]  You know when you rub it on your teeth and stuff like that?  And I was getting that feeling.  It kind of freaked me out.  I couldn't find a dealer in time to really get the bus I was looking for.  It doesn't work.  Chloroceptic does nothing.  It doesn't work at all.  It's very short-lived.  It numbs it up nice.  It numbs it up a little.  I like a leave, man.  A leave's a great pain medication.  Radville.  Very good.  I should announce, too, Anthony, that Kid Rock is supposed to stop by.  Yeah.  But there seems to be some forces in the works. 
[00:10:00]  Some force.  Darth Vader?  Anakin?  Who?  What forces are at work?  We'll have to wait and see.  But it was a guarantee that he was going to hang with us today.  Is it people from the Empire?  Next thing you know, there's things going on around us.  Things.  Things.  Things.  You know how this happens.  It's the C-block.  By the midget.  Is the C-block in effect?  I think it is.  By the midget.  I'd hate to give him credit if it isn't him.  No need to blame a little person who dresses in baggy clothes to somehow try to fight off middle age. 
[00:10:30]  Don't try to blame somebody who's fighting off the end of his youth.  Long being gone.  Maybe the girls will think I'm 25 again.  I like rock people.  I know all the rock people.  Do you really?  Middle age balding nothing?  Oh.  So we'll have to wait and see.  But Kid Rock was very excited to hang with us.  I know.  That's to know there's things happening around us.  So we got guitars and amps here and everything. 
[00:11:00]  We're doing our best to make sure Kid Rock stops by and says hi today.  Regardless, we're going to the show.  Because we're all going to the show tonight.  Right.  All right, Anthony.  Right.  So we got an action-packed show.  That's for sure.  You want to know what's out there so far for the Strangest Thing contest?  Yeah.  What?  The Vietnam era thing.  I kind of like.  Yeah.  What do you mean it's all right?  That's pretty good.  Hold on.  We haven't announced what it is yet, Steve.  A little flower. 
[00:11:30]  Steve from foundrymusic.com is outside.  Checking out what people are bringing by.  Yeah.  It's shaping up okay.  There's a kid out there.  It's early in the game, man.  No, I know.  I know.  I'm just saying that there's a guy who showed up with a Vietnamese ear in a jar, but he forgot  his ID, so he's got to go drive home an hour.  Son of a bitch.  Oh.  And.  What?  Yeah.  These people are like.  If you don't bring ID, we can't bring you up here.  Can't he?  Why?  Can't he give it to somebody with ID?  He wasn't willing to do that.  Why can't someone. 
[00:12:00]  Someone with ID escort him up.  He wasn't willing to do that.  Why can't that guy come up here if he doesn't have ID?  You can send somebody downstairs.  Yeah.  Did he leave yet?  Silly.  I don't know.  I'll check.  We don't want to lose Vietnamese ear guy.  No, you're not going to lose him.  He's going to come back.  All right.  Well, we're giving away the, you know, the grand prize by 615 because we've got to get  you over to the FU Center for the Kid Rock Show tonight.  Gook ear.  Huh?  It's at the spectrum.  Oh, it's at the spectrum.  Oh, sorry.  Gook ear.  Sorry.  Gook ear.  Gook ear on the way.  How psyched.  I've heard about those.  Also, a girl who can put two, three liter bottles of soda under her boobs. 
[00:12:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  That's kind of cool to say.  What's the weird thing she's bringing?  Her pituitary gland?  Fat idiot.  Those huge cans.  It would be great.  And then there's a man out there who wants to eat homeless person's crap to try to win  the Kid Rock package.  Can we start with that after the break?  Did he bring a homeless person?  He brought a homeless person's crap. 
[00:13:00]  How do we know it's a homeless person's crap?  Who cares?  That's what I asked him.  He said he picked it out of the garbage.  I said, I don't know.  Wouldn't it be doggy?  Wait, can we go down?  Can someone run down with the mic and let's talk to him really fast?  We'll talk to him.  Okay.  Can you get right down before we take a break?  Let's be honest.  From the safety of our studio.  You can't look and go, wow, that seems like a rich person's feces.  That's not gross enough.  No.  Could just be pudding.  Hey, man, it has to be homeless person crap.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's it over the top there?  Can we grab a homeless guy to take a dump? 
[00:13:30]  There's plenty of them around here.  Yeah, believe me.  That was ridiculous.  And it's got a little comment.  Yeah, well, I was walking from the hotel to the station here.  And I passed by statues of some of the Minutemen, Opie.  Very historic city here, Philadelphia.  Well, we're mere yards away from the Liberty Bell.  The Liberty Bell.  And there were statues of the Minutemen.  So as I'm making my way up the sidewalk, I see a whole collection of little elementary school children 
[00:14:00]  gathered around the statues of the Minutemen on a little field trip.  Remember going on field trips when you were a kid?  Then you gather around the teachers there and you learn a little something.  You get out in the fresh air.  You see the statues.  They're all so big and everything like that.  And then I'm walking a little further.  And I see now that they have live people dressed like the Minutemen.  Kind of talking.  You know how they do that thing where they get into the character of the historical person that they're representing.  And they tell the kids a story. 
[00:14:30]  And you learn that way about the Minutemen and what it was all about during the Revolution  and how they would call to arms against the British.  Very good history lesson for kids on a field trip.  So I get around the corner and now I can see all four of the Minutemen.  The last guy?  I am fine with political correctness.  I'm fine with things like inclusion.  I'm fine with that.  But you cannot accurately depict Minutemen and, you know, make everybody feel good about themselves in the little group of school kids. 
[00:15:00]  There's no reason to have a black Minuteman in there.  This is revolutionary.  For the love of God.  Maybe the question was how long have you held a job?  No.  Stop it.  That is not what I'm talking about.  I'm just saying I do not believe in all the history I've read reading about black Minutemen. 
[00:15:30]  There wasn't one, Anthony?  I don't know if there was one.  There had to be one.  Do you really think there was one?  Had to be.  A black Minuteman.  Do you think the rest of the Minutemen would have them?  Look, I understand times have changed.  We've made leaps and bounds.  We've made great advances in civil rights.  But, you know, there was a time in this country where it was very, very ugly, Opie. 
[00:16:00]  And that was during the Revolutionary War.  Slavery in full effect.  Some of our greatest leaders had slaves.  So we didn't look upon black people in this country in the 1700s like we did people.  They were thought of as possessions.  They weren't even figured as being full human beings.  They were thought of as chattel.  So you don't think it's right to portray history in that way?  Well, I don't think it's accurate to show the children Minutemen lined up when I do not believe that there were black Minutemen. 
[00:16:30]  You know, to arms, to arms, and, you know, take them out of the cotton field and dress them up like a Minuteman and send them out with a gun.  It's kind of like throwing a white guy into, I don't know, an African...  Very good point, Opie.  Now, if you go to an African festival and they have authentic African dance and there's a bunch of people watching and learning history about what it was like to be in a tribal Africa many years ago. 
[00:17:00]  And there were African people of African descent dancing around.  I don't know.  You put the bone in.  You have the plates.  Whatever you want to do.  You're going around the fire with this beer.  You know, like an African.  With the carrot stick on your junk?  Yeah.  Yeah, the big carrot stick thing on your junk.  That was a great Discovery Channel moment.  That was my favorite Discovery Channel moment.  Why did they decide to put a three or four foot big long stick over their junk and tie it to their shoulder and walk around? 
[00:17:30]  We called it like the carrot stick.  It was a big carrot.  It looked like a huge carrot.  Yeah.  And they're like,  hunting monkeys in the trees.  They go, with the blowgun.  The guy goes,  and the monkey falls out of the tree.  And he ties the tail of the monkey around the monkey's neck and wore it like a little purse home.  Like a little shoulder thing.  I thought it was brilliant.  But he got the blowgun.  He went,  fascinating. 
[00:18:00]  Fascinating.  But, if you want to accurately depict that, you don't have a white guy going,  hey-ya-yo, hey-yo, ya-ya, poot-ai-yo.  You know, it doesn't fit.  You'd look at it and go, hmm, that looks a little odd.  Looks a little off.  Doesn't look like it's accurately depicting the moment they're going for.  That's all I'm trying to say. 
[00:18:30]  Are you sure there were no black Minutemen?  I don't know if there were or not.  I don't believe there were.  I'm basing this on the time.  We have a guy on the line who's saying that there was definitely black Minutemen.  I know there's a lot of revisionist history going on out there, people.  Believe me.  How do we get the phones up here?  I want photographic evidence.  Just say the line.  All right, cool.  Let's talk to Turkish.  Turkish?  On line four.  He claims there was a black Minutemen.  All right.  Educate me, Turkish.  Anthony?  Yes.  There were, dude.  They would, like, make them, like, into troops and send them first. 
[00:19:00]  They were like a human shield for the white Minutemen.  The meat shield?  Yeah.  Would you stop it?  No, dude, seriously.  I will not believe that.  I learned it like seven grade.  That was property.  Yeah, yeah.  That was best to use.  And if they won, if they still live, they get their freedom.  That was best to use to keep the economy going by, you know, doing things like picking the tobacco and the cotton.  And to make them feel good, we just called them Minutemen? 
[00:19:30]  Minutemen, because you're going to live a minute out there on the battlefield.  Before some British cannon takes your head off.  Let's go above Turkish and talk to Mike.  Mike says Anthony is wrong.  I knew this was going to happen.  A lot of revisionist history.  You've got to be careful.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  What's up?  Anthony, you're wrong.  They did have Minutemen and black Minutemen back then.  Who do you think cleaned the white Minutemen's horse's stables dropping?  All right.  See, now, now, now.  See, we can't have an intelligent discussion. 
[00:20:00]  He's trying to make a joke.  Why can't we have an intelligent discussion about this?  He's trying to make a joke.  But I'll take some of what he said and make it serious, Hopi.  All right.  I do believe that the Minutemen were supported by slave labor.  You know, who do you think did help them out and help make the things they needed and harvest things that they needed?  Sure, the slaves, but I truly do not believe that the white man back then would give a black man the Minuteman uniform and a gun to go out and defend America or try to revolt against the British. 
[00:20:30]  You know what I mean?  That's what I'm saying.  I don't think it was accurately depicted here in Philadelphia when I was walking here and I saw four Minutemen, one of them black, and a bunch of little kids during the field trip looking.  All right.  We're going to move on, I think, which is fine.  Why?  What's the matter?  Hey, we can't have, because we can't have this, a serious conversation on this without guys being idiots on the phone lines. 
[00:21:00]  I get all my history from blazing saddles.  That's right.  My American history.  All right.  Anthony, we're going to go downstairs outside.  All right.  Outside the WYSP studios.  I think Steve is out there.  Steve?  Yeah.  Hello?  Let me give you a little more volume.  We're figuring out all the buttons here.  Did that one work?  That works perfect.  Thanks, Steve.  Hey, fellas.  How are you?  Steve, how many people are outside now?  There is a good 60 or 50, 60 people sitting outside, like staring at me like deers caught in headlights. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I really can't figure out the, you know, it's a weird scene right now.  It's a weird scene.  You know what?  I'm a little flustered.  I just visually verified the item I was mentioning to you before.  Which item?  There's a gentleman to my left.  Come here, sir.  Sir, what's your name?  Nick Peccarelli.  I want to say hello to everybody now.  All right.  Give me the goddamn thing.  Nick just...  Poor guy.  Steve's got no patience.  Yeah, Steve hates when we sent him out on the street.  Nick just...  Nick's to win the prize today. 
[00:22:00]  You know, it's in a...  What looks like a doggy canister from a restaurant.  All right.  It's in a little plastic Tupperware kind of doggy thing from a restaurant.  And he opened it.  And the smell and the texture I could only explain as being that of crap.  Oh, it is.  Where did you get this stuff, Nick?  I parked my car.  I was thinking of stuff to do.  Come down here.  And I guess off of 676, I pulled over as a homeless guy there. 
[00:22:30]  I had a Wendy's thing because I ate lunch today.  And I asked the guy, give him five bucks.  He would crap in the thing.  And he was more than happy to oblige it.  There's some poppy seeds in there.  All right.  Very nice.  All right.  You guys want to meet him?  We're going to have to take a break and figure it out, I think.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  All right.  There's Steve outside the radio station with some of our listeners.  I guess the Blacks served as Minutemen at Concord, Lexington. 
[00:23:00]  A few early Patriots.  Cato Stedman.  Cuff Whitmore.  Cato Wood.  Prince Estabrook.  Caesar Ferret.  Look at this.  I'm getting a whole list of Black Minutemen.  And Cato Kaelin.  Well, shut my mouth.  There you go.  See?  We educate you on this program.  I thought it looked a little odd.  Now, Ken, Super GM Ken Stevens. 
[00:23:30]  Ken Stevens, yes.  He's back in New York.  He's panicking over Dump Guy.  Why?  Why, Rick?  You got a page?  I got a call.  He got in touch with Mr. Sabian, who scurried up here and let me know that we are...  Well, let's get him on the phone.  Super GM?  Get Super GM Ken Stevens on this phone.  We must speak with him immediately.  Immediately.  Opie, why don't you just turn back to Uhura, ask her to open a hailing frequency to New York, 
[00:24:00]  and we will speak.  Look on the big screen.  You're the captain of this vessel, sitting there in your big captain chair.  Well, we're just getting...  Do you have buttons on your armrest?  I don't know what half these buttons do.  I think I'm going to eject someone from the studio here by accident.  I hope I push the right buttons here.  Yes.  Well, Ant, we're just getting started looking for the strangest thing you can bring to us  down here at WISP.  Fifth in market.  The winner's going to win a guitar signed by Kid Rock. 
[00:24:30]  Meet and greet with Kid Rock before the show tonight.  And front row seats to the Kid Rock show tonight at the Spectrum.  There you go.  And, yeah, we're going to be at the show.  We can't wait for that as well.  So why don't we take a break, step aside here, and we'll continue with the festivities,  all right?  Very cool.  I got the cheddar.  I could pay the rank.  Four, three, two.  Frank!  He's a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  Frank!  Frank!  Hope you like crap. 
[00:25:00]  Just called Hardwired.  What the hell is that?  Hardwired.  Hardwired.  Very funny.  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Executioners with Linkin Park.  It's going down.  We're broadcasting live from WYSP in Philly!  Hey!  We're doing our Strangest Thing contest. 
[00:25:30]  We did it in Boston.  We did it in New York.  And now we're seeing what Philly has to offer.  We got a great Kid Rock package for the grand prize.  What, an autographed guitar that we're checking out right now?  Yeah.  I'm meeting three to Kid Rock and front row tickets to the show tonight at the Spectrum.  Spectrum, excuse me.  We're all going to the show after.  Oh, hell yeah.  After the radio broadcast.  Did you like my latest?  Your Hotwire read?  Did everyone get to hear that?  Oh, good.  All I know is every so often, Steve asks us, hey, could you come in during commercials and record a read? 
[00:26:00]  And it's either for Hotwire or my great Strauss Auto, discount auto tags.  And, you know, I just read through the Hotwire, as you've heard them on the show.  Hotwire, you guys, your travel site, discount travel site.  It'll save you a lot of money.  Whatever.  You know?  We read them.  It's very nice.  Great sponsor.  I hope he goes in, and I don't know what he does in there.  We don't go in at the same time anymore. 
[00:26:30]  No.  So I hear this one, and it's...  Just log on.  Hotwire.  Hotwire.  What voice is that?  It sounds like Kathleen Turner from The Graduate.  It's called...  Hi.  It's called The Voice That Get Me Out of Reading Commercials.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not a big fan of the commercial part of this, are you?  I love our sponsors and stuff, but...  But you don't like recording the...  No, because I think other people could do a much better job than me, and I'm trying to,  you know, give the salespeople a little hint.  Oh, is that it?  A hint?  Yeah.  Just log on. 
[00:27:00]  Hotwire.  It doesn't even sound like...  No, I'm listening to it going, who is doing the read for this?  Did you hear it, Jim?  It's just...  It's awful.  It's awful.  It's an awful voice coming out of you.  Log on, right on.  Save money on airfare.  Hotwire.  When I first got in the radio business, you know, because, you know, you've got to do  a lot of commercial reads.  Sure.  I would just hit record and whatever came out for 60 seconds, and I would put that in 
[00:27:30]  as a commercial with the stuttering and the stammering that I love to do and mispronouncing  of words.  And I would just leave it.  And you'd leave it.  Oh, yeah.  And it would run on the radio station.  But next thing you know, all the other jocks would get a lot more commercials to read  than I read.  I realized that when we started working together.  There were these little cubbies, little cubby with your name on it, in the production studio.  And every night after the show, we would go in to the production studio and look at our 
[00:28:00]  little cubbies.  And at first, Opie got most of the production because I was so new to radio, they did not  trust me to do a commercial for anything.  My cubby would have, I don't know, five or six commercials.  You would have me.  I would have a tag.  A 10-second tag.  Like, you know, a TV show commercial.  We're like, tune in tonight on ABC when blah, blah, blah.  And at the end, I'd go, on ABC 7.  You know, that's all I'd do.  You know, that was it. 
[00:28:30]  That's all they trusted me with.  And Opie's got these long things, like, up in Massachusetts, it was, you know, go out  to Sir Morgan's Cove in Worcester.  And he's on 20 bands, he'd have to say, with names that you could not possibly pronounce.  Nah.  And he'd have to put music behind the bands.  Music's too loud.  You then can't hear Opie.  It was an abortion.  I was talking over the vocals, which is a no-no.  I didn't care.  So I am so into making a career of this that I am spending hours in production to do one 
[00:29:00]  thing on ABC, on ABC, on ABC, on ABC, on ABC, on ABC, and slowly they gave me more production.  Yeah, the piles would change.  I mean, all of a sudden, I would be down to the 10-second tag, and his production, Cubby,  would be all the way to the ceiling.  And I was using all 16 tracks of the recorder, the 16 track that we had, because I would be 
[00:29:30]  start being creative, like, all right, I'm doing a read for a motorcycle place, you know?  So I'd put motorcycle sounds in, and traffic sounds, and like, kind of do it up, make it  sound cool.  Hey, spring is in the air, you know, dripping of rain and stuff like that, and I really got  into it.  And before I knew it, I was there until midnight, every night, and I would be like, our show  would end at 7, and I'd go, whoa, hey, it's 7.05, I'm out of here, I'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  I'm smart. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Opie's like, you know, click, record, buy Mitch Island tires.  Click, bump, gone, gone.  I would be doing a read for, like, Alice in Chains cover band.  Yeah.  And instead of trying to find a cool riff or something, I would just plunk the, you know,  back then, it was still on, you know, records, just plunk the needle down in the middle of  a song, and just start talking for 60 seconds.  Swear to you.  And I'm in there, in the sound effects thing going, I need a UFO landing effect.  Not taking off, not flying.  The only thing that works is a UFO landing. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I got screwed, man.  I'm doing so much.  And now, I hope he's back to his old tricks.  He doesn't like Steve coming in and saying, hey, that's why I'm called Slappy.  Because, you know what, I take our show very seriously, and Steve's main job is to bother  us when we go to commercials, to record more commercials.  To bother us.  His main job.  Your job is to bother us.  Your main job is to bother us now.  That's all I do.  Every time we go to commercials in New York, Steve comes walking in, you got to do this, 
[00:31:00]  this, this, and this.  And I sit there going, wait, we got a radio show to do here.  Do you know that the main thing that Ben and I have to tell people when they ask you  guys to cut copy is, okay, give us three or four days, because it's going to take that  long to get Opie in the studio to cut it.  They work as a team, too.  Ben will go, like, we'll go into commercials, and Ben will go, um, is it a Hotwire read?  Maybe, you guys?  And we'll just turn to Ben and go, Ben, F you.  F you.  We're worried about the money snatch thing right now.  Yeah.  And then next day. 
[00:31:30]  And then all of a sudden, Ben, okay, I don't care, even though he does.  Our Steve is a pesky Steve.  He's a pesky beat when it comes down to this kind of stuff.  So yesterday, while doing that new voice that I just came up with, Hotwire.  Hotwire.  That's going to run for a week, too, man.  For a week, you're going to hear that.  That's great.  I don't care how you voice it.  Just as long as he gets it down.  All right, good.  It's done.  These people will stop complaining.  And then I'll give him instructions.  It's like, yeah, you can fix that little mistake. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, I've heard these funny things.  Like, slap, he'll throw it down and go, just cut the beginning of that off.  Right.  You know, the whole thing blows.  It was charming.  Thank you.  I'm trying to record, and normally I sit down at the console while he stands up and reads,  and he's just blowing ass in my face the whole time.  Ah, not the whole time.  One slipped out, because I was really using my diaphragm for that new voice.  Oh, yeah, it really sounds like you were projecting.  You know, I always get yelled at, and you let one go in the truck last night, too. 
[00:32:30]  He was shifting.  Did he?  It was annoying, because you know he's getting older, because he's shifting, and it's slipped  out.  In a vehicle, he's notorious.  I don't know why he even agreed to the ruling in the studio, because he is one of the worst.  There was a time you let one loose in your blazer when we were working in Massachusetts,  where I opened the door and tucked and rolled as the vehicle was moving.  I would rather have the injury to me of leaving a moving vehicle than the thought that crap 
[00:33:00]  molecules are going in my nose at such a concentrated...  I've gotten much better.  What?  Much better.  Awful.  So, where are we at?  We had Ken Stevens on the phone, but he hung up on us.  What happened there?  Well, we got to win the Kid Rock thing.  I'm trying again.  He went to eat a homeless guy's homemade pudding.  We're always looking for a showstopper.  This is a nice showstopper.  That sounds like a showstopper.  Where's the list of the other things we got?  I think the guys are outside the studio. 
[00:33:30]  Why is it okay for someone to eat a spleen, but they can't eat that?  I don't think it was okay for that guy to eat the spleen either.  I don't either.  I think Ken was on vacation.  What's he doing listening to this show?  I don't know.  We haven't seen him in a week and a half.  Doesn't he have 20 hours of programming to worry about?  Aside from these four.  I'm getting ourselves out of all sorts of things because he's not around,  and now he's going to bother us?  Jeez. 
[00:34:00]  Tendo, what's that?  Doesn't he have problems?  Didn't he get yelled at at the big Infinity Corporate meetings?  Ken got yelled at?  I don't know.  I would assume he would.  You don't run a station like any W in New York and not get yelled at by your bosses.  Yeah.  All right, we got Harry from Northeast Philly.  He brought all three things, Steve.  Yes, he did.  Okay, he brought us a cat skull, Anthony.  Right, cat skull's kind of cool.  Hey, bro.  Oh, you're the guy? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  You're at the bomber from the pipe bomb guy.  Are you the only singer of Apathy?  You're singing a band, Apathy, or anything?  No.  All right, he brought a cat skull, Anthony.  He brought part of his brother's...  Oh, look at that.  Umbilical cord.  I've seen an umbilical cord.  And a pig testicle and tail.  What is that?  That's a testicle and a tail.  Damn.  Let me see, let me see, bro.  And the cat skull's kind of cool.  It's Harry from Northeast Philly.  Yeah, I got that.  Yeah, where'd you get the pig tail and the pig testicle? 
[00:35:00]  My fiancee, when she was in college, she's a veterinary technician.  She had to castrate a pig and dock its tail and cut its teeth.  And I told her to save the testicle and the tail for him.  Yeah.  Why did she have to do that to the pig?  Was she trying to join now?  No, part of their training.  Oh, they'll get back.  Look at you with your potty mouth.  All right, you can take your pig tail and pig testicle back.  And what about the umbilical cord there?  Are you going to...  What the hell?  Oh, it's got the clip on it.  Oh, that's disgusting. 
[00:35:30]  That's your brother's?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How old's your brother?  My brother's 13 now.  I was eight when he was born.  And I was like, yeah, let's take it off when it falls off and put it in the jar.  And you've been keeping it ever since?  Oh, yeah, I just keep it on.  I used to have more stuff, but I can't find where I put it all.  That's a little odd, isn't it?  I just moved, and I can't find where I put it all.  I used to have stuff like, you know, chickens, feet, and stuff like that.  Just in and...  All kinds of stuff.  That's preservative. 
[00:36:00]  This is pretty impressive.  That's pretty good.  His brother's cord.  All right.  You're in the lead, obviously.  And a cat skull.  That's pretty cool.  Why do you save this stuff?  This I thought was cool as hell.  Because, see, I used to live next to this lady.  She was like the neighborhood cat lady.  She had like a million cats in her house.  And she went insane, and they took her away.  Yeah, they usually do.  They left all the cats, and then they boarded up the house.  Wow.  So we went in there.  Like, someone broke in and started, you know, using it as a party house and, like, you know, taking drugs and stuff. 
[00:36:30]  With all the cats?  No, the cats all died.  Oh, they were all...  So I went in there to board it up with my pop so, you know, it didn't catch fire.  Because we're in row homes.  If one goes, they all go.  And we went in there, and there was a hole in the floor, and I went in there with a flashlight.  What the heck's all that?  All cat bones, all underneath the floorboards.  They all crawled under there to die.  Was she killed by Alex with a giant plastic phallus?  She's insane.  That's pretty cool.  Well, you're in the lead for the whole Kid Rock thing.  Awesome.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I've got to be honest with you. 
[00:37:00]  We've got a guy that's bringing a gook ear down.  That's killer.  Gook ear is pretty good, right?  That's killer.  He forgot his ID, so now he's driving an hour back to his house to come back an hour.  That's crazy.  We're Jolly Green Giants with guns.  Happy birthday, zipper heads.  These are great days, bros.  And we also got, oh, can we talk to Matt on the national line from PA Line 8?  He's the guy that's bringing down the pickled punk fetuses, Andy.  Oh, good.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  What's going on? 
[00:37:30]  Actually, I knew you were going to come on because I just, you know, I've been on hold for like 20 minutes.  I just went into the bathroom.  I knew you were going to pick up right now.  I even said that going in.  Hey, this is the most embarrassing call I've got to make in my life.  My mom found out about us doing this.  And she got pissed off about the formaldehyde and was afraid of us, like, dying, I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah.  She got into my house and itched him, dude.  Yep.  So you don't have it?  Your mommy threw away your fetuses.  She threw away my fetuses. 
[00:38:00]  Can you believe that?  But, yo, check this out, dude.  I don't know if you remember.  We were down there for the Naughty Nighty contest.  The original contestant, number 17 best with the kitty cat tattoo.  Remember right before the show ended?  Hey, Matt, thanks for calling the Opinality Show.  Matt, thank you so much.  There's a man taking a dump telling us his mommy threw out his fetuses.  How awful is that?  Hey, we've got to go to Ken Stevens online.  Oh, thank goodness.  Ken Stevens.  Shoot a super GM.  Super GM, Ken Stevens.  Hey.  Ken, are you in a suit today or you're casual wear like yesterday? 
[00:38:30]  No, I'm back in a suit.  Good, good, good.  Are you on your way to Philly?  I am in the train station on my way to Philly.  Oh.  I can't wait to see you.  Oh, really?  Why?  What's the problem now, Ken?  No problem at all.  Yes, I really...  It was great to hear Opie's production secret.  I was on hold before and I heard that.  Oh, you heard it?  Yeah.  He has to listen to the show to see what we're up to.  Isn't that amazing?  I wondered why you never did any production. 
[00:39:00]  Hell no.  So what's up with Homeless Crap Guy?  Not a lot.  There's not much you can do with that idea.  I listened to him.  That's one of those ideas that can't go very far.  Really?  Is it the actual...  It's all of the above.  The whole subject is sort of a place you can't go.  All right.  Let's say we take the eating part out, but we have a homeless guy come in and do that on 
[00:39:30]  your desk here at WYSP.  Would that be acceptable?  What happened if I just whacked my bag watching?  That violates two rules.  Oh, it does?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not good either.  That must be the Psycho Mark ruling of...  Right.  That's the one.  ...1999, I believe.  Right.  That's one.  All right.  You have a nice office down here, Ken, by the way.  We got a meeting in it.  Do you mind? 
[00:40:00]  Uh...  Someone opened up the office?  You're not supposed to have ever seen the inside of my office.  We went through a couple of things.  You got some interesting stuff in your office.  Opie held up a broken pen and goes, I bet we did this.  We pictured you sitting at the desk just breaking your pens.  Yeah, that's possible.  That's very likely.  How come there's no...  You were in my desk also with my broken pen?  Yeah, we were going through all your stuff, Ken.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  I'm sorry you had to find out this way. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Someone's going to be punished when I get there.  Well, you know something?  Perhaps if there were one or two pictures of Opie and Anthony hanging in the hallways  instead of other personalities, perhaps we wouldn't be so bitter.  There are only rock stars in the hallways.  There's no...  Oh, no.  Radio guys.  You have every jock that has ever worked for WISP, Hank.  Yeah.  Except your old pals.  Your pals ain't here.  Oh, they try to gussy it up with some electrical tape spelling wow on the windows  like it was there yesterday, too.  But we know the truth. 
[00:41:00]  I feel like it'll be there tomorrow.  Right.  Exactly.  We know the truth.  It would be nice if we saw our faces hanging in the hallways.  Well.  Okay.  Can we get girls to get completely naked, lay on Ken's desk, and we can take some pictures?  Yeah, we got Taylor.  Oh, Taylor?  Yeah.  Let's do that.  All right, Ken, we're going to...  All right, Ken, we got to go.  We're busy.  Goodbye.  Ken, have a good trip.  Toot, toot.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Ken?  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, Ken?  There you go.  All right, we got to take a break.  Pat Croce is in.  Yes, Pat.  How you been?  Good?  I'm great.  I'm great, eh?  Very cool.  How you doing?  Very good, man.  You guys hitting big time now.  20 markets or 50 markets?  Sure.  Seems to be working.  I knock on it every time someone says that.  And you still got my buddy Norton here.  Jimmy Norton.  We're going to talk to Pat Croce next.  Yeah.  So let's take a quick break and we'll get to it.  Welcome to the bottomless kick of ignorance. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I think hilarious.  The O.P. and Anthony Show, 1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show, broadcasting live from Philly, WISP Studios,  Anthony.  We got a lot going on.  We've got a couple hundred people outside the studio bringing some strange stuff down  here, Ant, you know?  Yes. 
[00:42:30]  The grand prize winner is going to win some tickets to see Kid Rock tonight in the front  row.  You're going to meet Kid Rock and you're going to walk away with an autographed guitar from  Kid Rock.  So far, the guy in the lead is the guy with the umbilical cord.  Yeah.  And his brother.  Yeah, his brother's umbilical cord.  And what else did he have?  Kid's testicle and tail and a cat's skull.  Nice.  Yeah, it kind of hedged his bed.  He brought a few things.  We're going to see some guy's mother's gallbladder stone in a little while. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Sick on a couple of levels.  And it's still inside of him.  Gookier guy is back.  Oh, this is amazing.  We're thinking he's going to win the whole thing.  So, well, it turns out he got the ear from, I believe, his father or uncle, somebody that  was in the war.  And this was commonplace.  You would just collect little trinkets from your victory. 
[00:43:30]  And one of these was an ear.  You've heard about that, right?  They made necklaces out of the ears.  Combat's a horrible thing, Opie.  You wouldn't know unless you were in it.  You know.  You know, we're stupid.  Why?  I see TV cameras.  I'm like, wow, we must be really, really important people.  We're in Philly.  They want to cover us for the TV news.  No, it's not.  And then I realized, wait, no, it's because Pat Croce is in the studio.  Of course.  Don't be silly.  I'm hiding out.  Are you?  I'm hiding out with you guys right now.  Yeah? 
[00:44:00]  You don't mind being seen with us, Pat?  Not at all.  You kidding?  The O&A crew are top.  Yeah, we try.  I want to see the guy with the ears on the line, though.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I want to say.  I've got to see the ear guy.  We might as well bring him up while Pat's here, huh?  Yeah, definitely.  You know, give the news something to check out.  You've been cool lately?  You're hanging low?  I haven't heard you doing anything too wild?  No, no adventures right now.  Working for the NBA right now, the NBA.  So it's pretty cool.  Tomorrow I'm off to Dallas.  Dallas plays Sacramento.  So I get to see my buddy Mark Cuban. 
[00:44:30]  Talking about one off the top.  Yeah.  Mark is out of his mind.  He's fun.  He's great for the league.  He's great for...  Look what he's done in Dallas.  Mm-hmm.  He's kicked it up a notch.  That whole city's wild.  Right.  They've got a great team.  See, who cares about Dallas?  Oh.  They're on in Dallas, too.  Oh, boy.  I'm a Knicks fan, Pat.  Yeah, that's right.  I feel sorry for you.  You know, I understand that we're going to have some tough years now, though.  We had to get rid of Ewing and go through some tough times.  I said that for years.  Yeah.  Right, eh?  Yes, you have.  And hates basketball.  I am not a big basketball fan. 
[00:45:00]  Just watch him not as you say stuff.  That's what I do.  What's your favorite sport, eh?  I got it.  Favorite sport?  Besides what I see walking around here.  To watch?  To watch?  Probably football.  And to go to?  I like going to the baseball games.  You know?  Hang out.  You got baseball in New York.  I know.  Come on.  Yankees.  Yankee fan.  I'm a bad fan.  I must have killed you last year at the end with the Diamondbacks.  Yeah, you know, game after game, they're coming back and winning.  It looked like it was going to be destiny because, you know, when New York needed the 
[00:45:30]  picker-upper after September 11th.  And then, ah, you got to give it to the Diamondbacks.  That was a great World Series.  Even if you weren't a baseball fan, people were attached to that.  That's a matter of annoying.  That really disgusted me.  It really was annoying.  18-2 loss in game six.  I went to hell for myself.  It was awful.  Well, what do you think Philly fans are?  Schilling's the one who's not even here anymore.  I know.  And then he starts pitching great.  Although it was really...  He didn't pitch that well for...  He played well here.  He was great with Philly.  He was great with Schilling.  Not like he's doing now.  I hate him. 
[00:46:00]  He's the first seven-game winner.  Right, exactly.  Watching that little Kim kid meltdown was hysterical.  That was a highlight of the series, man.  And then when they put him in again, and he did even worse, it was just...  The material we got off of that was just fantastic.  Picture him delivering food on a bicycle.  But getting back to the NBA, I'm hoping the Nets do well, obviously.  You've got to root for the Nets now.  One guy, Jason Kidd, who brings that leadership to the court, and the whole team picks it up.  I was at the game on Sunday.  They played great.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  They got a shot.  Hey.  Yeah?  They're on the dance floor.  They definitely got a shot.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think I can name four teams that are fighting it out right now.  I couldn't name four teams.  What are you talking about?  I have no clue.  I was telling me...  I'm sorry.  Hey, don't worry about it, man.  I was telling me during the commercials he doesn't think anyone's going to beat the Lakers again.  Really?  You know that team.  I've heard of them, right?  Big 300 pounds, 350 pounds, 7-foot concession stand.  It stands right in the middle.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  That's right.  Yes.  His successor. 
[00:47:00]  I know he played for them.  Shaq, I loved you in Game of Death.  You're the co-pilot in that airplane movie.  Why'd you change your name from Lou?  Yeah, I'm not really too up on it.  I try sometimes when I'm getting ready to come into work, I listen to 1010 Winds in New York, the news station.  And sometimes they'll have some basketball news on there, and I'll remember it so I can kind of freak Opie out.  Hey, yeah, you don't have to.  And then I blurt something out, and he looks at me like, what?  And then I screwed it up the other day. 
[00:47:30]  I said triple over time, and it was only double, and he laughed at me.  I'm an ass.  I got him.  I suck.  A lot of people on the phone saying, Pat, you've got to come back to the Sixers.  You don't want to deal with that crap anymore, do you?  They've done that.  They've done that.  It was a great run.  That was a great run.  Because from worst to first, the whole city was rejuvenated.  It was really cool.  Right.  You get it.  Even non-Philly fans were Philadelphia fans, because people loved AI.  They loved their sports down here.  I figured that out right off the bat.  So what do you think of Allen Iverson and Larry Brown? 
[00:48:00]  What's your take?  They'll work it out.  They both respect each other.  Like, you two, you probably have some good fights.  You want to explain to Anthony, is there a problem with the two gentlemen?  Does there seem to be a problem with the gentlemen?  No, you know, I think one is combing his hair a little different than the other one.  Is that an argument?  Yeah, that seems to be the problem.  Are they on the same team?  Look at the...  Yeah.  You know what, it's like, it's a coach and star player like a father or son.  Oh, see, okay. 
[00:48:30]  Now I get it a little more.  All right.  Yeah, it's cool.  Coach, player, problem.  They're both not saying it's cool, right?  Yeah, they're saying it's cool.  They both respect each other.  They have a different way of looking at things on the court.  That's all.  What do you think is the problem?  Allen?  Let's put you on the spot.  Look at that.  Tell me what I was doing right there.  Let's put you on the spot.  No, man.  I'm...  Oh, you've been there.  Come on.  And you've been in the same shoes that I've been in.  Right.  When you can't talk about something.  Oh, all right.  Hey, you think that ABA will take off?  With that red, white, and blue ball? 
[00:49:00]  I kind of like that.  I'm ready to get on board with that.  You can put a fro in that line.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your new thing going?  See?  You just saved your ass.  The TV camera's rolling.  I like that ABA.  That's what we do on the show.  We put people on the spot from time to time.  Hey, I listen.  I watch Rick Barry with the underhanded foul shot.  Oh, my goodness.  Come on.  I could go old school.  You are.  You're going way old.  The San Diego conquistadors.  Oh.  Do you know who John Barry is?  No. 
[00:49:30]  His sons are now playing the NBA.  Hey, how about that?  I was just going to say that, Opie.  I think he has, like, five sons playing in the NBA.  Does he?  Actually, three, maybe.  How time goes by, huh?  Look at that.  You also worked with Jason Williams.  Yeah, my buddy.  Oh, boy.  I used to be his conditioning coach.  I don't know if you know this, though.  So, in 1990, 92, when he was with the 76ers, him and Charles Barkley patted around.  They were a wild duo.  And I loved him.  I mean, his intensity, his craziness.  And then I got to work again with him on NBA and NBC.  And I miss him.  I totally miss him. 
[00:50:00]  And I feel bad, obviously, for the victim's family.  But I totally feel bad for him.  And he seems pretty screwed.  Man, it's a shame.  It seems like negligence.  It doesn't seem like the guy intentionally tried to kill somebody.  But you can't go around with guns like that and expect everything to be fine.  And then he just panicked.  Like, any one of us would do the same things that he did after that.  I think you just get to the point where you turn into a kid and you just broke something.  And it's like, all right, how do we cover it up?  But, you know, you've got some.  Let's throw it back together.  People are going to look into this.  Let's throw it back together.  And hope mom doesn't notice.  Yeah.  You can't be changing clothes. 
[00:50:30]  Put it in the closet.  Right.  Yeah.  You can't be changing the clothes and doing all kinds of things like that.  Poor guy, huh?  He's a great guy.  Poor chauffeur.  He's just there to drive around.  It's like, hey, Jason, nice bam.  Awful.  I don't know what else to say about that.  I feel kind of bad.  I'm sitting here.  I don't know anything about basketball.  I'm trying to get that going as long as possible.  He's doing great.  How about that middle-lock lemon? 
[00:51:00]  Why does that other team always lose?  Do you have any big stunts planned?  What do they need?  No, man.  I have no stunts planned.  And you remember when Pat was climbing bridges down here.  Well, that I remember.  Yeah, of course.  He's crazy when it comes to the bridge through scaling.  That was just to fuel the fire of the fans here.  They were all psyched.  Because it was the banner.  It was that 70-foot Go Sixers beat L.A. banner.  It was pretty cool.  You know, everyone got involved in it.  Well, you got some balls.  I like that.  You know, you're not afraid to get out there.  I wanted to rappel off that 400-foot bridge.  Really?  But the Coast Guard wouldn't let me.  The Coast Guard? 
[00:51:30]  They're in charge of that?  Yeah, they got the water rights, I guess, underneath.  They want you picking you up after you land in it, maybe.  And they duct taped his leg back together.  Yeah, that's right.  After the motorcycle accident.  We saw that last time we were in Philly.  He might win for bringing the oddest thing, his leg.  I don't care about Kirok.  I wanted to meet Pamela.  Oh, yeah.  We met her, what, about a month ago?  I still have the role of film.  I got to get it developed.  I got a picture of me and Pam Anderson.  You know, the obligatory shot where you got your arm around each other. 
[00:52:00]  And I wanted the picture to be perfect because it's going up on,  you ever hear of something called classmates.com?  It's like a website that you go and you register with the high schools that you've been in.  And there's all pictures of people, you know, 20 years later or something with their new wives and stuff.  I am just going to put me and Pam Anderson.  And go, here's me and my new chick, Pammy.  Yeah, and that way they go and say, how's Anthony doing?  Let me check.  Oh, my God, he's effing Pam Anderson.  You know?  I think that's kind of cool.  How are you waiting to get that developed?  How awful are her old classmates going to feel when they see her? 
[00:52:30]  I know.  Gee, what happened to Pam?  Boy, did she downgrade.  Yeah, you know what they'll say?  He must have some hog if he's following Tommy Lee.  All right?  What can I say?  You said it all.  Without ruining any more chances of having Kid Rock on the show.  You want to see the guy with the gook ear?  Yeah, where is that?  We got another one, too.  Yeah.  Human brain guy.  Human brain guy?  Yeah.  Well, let's bring him in.  That's interesting.  Where would you get a human brain?  Not in this studio. 
[00:53:00]  This is true.  A laughing little joke I told.  All right.  There's a...  Okay.  All right.  How you doing, man?  Yankee fan.  That's always good.  How are you, sir?  There you go.  Got a cooler.  All right.  Who has...  Does Pat know what we're doing?  Yeah, listen to the way I heard you.  Whoever brings in the most outrageous something or anything gets to see Kid Rock tonight.  And then you get an autographed guitar, you're in the front row, and you meet Kid Rock. 
[00:53:30]  Well, don't open it.  All right.  All right.  What's that?  This year.  That's the year?  Yeah.  You open that bottle up and, what, handle it?  No.  I mean, it doesn't come out of the jar, but we could bust it out now if you want.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  I wouldn't do that.  Why?  Let's just take a look at it.  All right.  Well, here.  Can you see it through the...  Oh, yeah, dude.  You definitely know.  It's hard.  It's real hard.  Is it like cartilage in there?  Yeah.  It's all dried up.  It's like 30 years old, man.  That's all.  Is it three feet?  A little teeny ear?  Wow.  That is a little... 
[00:54:00]  Oh, my God.  Can you play stuck in the middle with you?  Whoa.  It's petrified Vietnamese guy here.  Wow.  You're going to be kidding me.  No, dude.  That's the guy who shot my uncle, man.  Hey, let me in here.  Wait.  This guy's dead.  That's the guy.  That's the guy who shot my uncle.  Hold up the ear and go, what?  Is your uncle dead?  Your uncle died, and so one of your...  No, he committed suicide about three years ago, I guess.  Ah, damn.  Vietnam, dude.  Well, who grabbed the ear? 
[00:54:30]  His buddies in the 101st.  So he got shot.  He got shot.  He was laid up in bed, shot up, and then they brought him the ear.  They got the guy who shot him.  How did they get him?  Oh, I don't know.  They just, like, found him?  Yeah, they went in and got him.  They shot him up, chopped him up, and brought him his ear.  Wow.  Yeah, dude.  Awesome.  It's the best piece of war memorabilia ever.  Well, that's pretty...  You've got to say, that's pretty good.  That is pretty good.  Yeah.  That's going to be tough to beat.  Well, but you've got a guy with a brain?  Yeah.  But where'd the brain come from? 
[00:55:00]  That's the question.  Where'd the brain come from?  Where's the brain guy?  Brain guy.  Hey, Bruce, show me.  Come up here.  How you doing?  I like...  Okay.  How you doing?  Hey, hey.  I'm a medical student, and I have access to anatomy labs, so I kind of borrowed...  You borrowed a human brain.  Yeah.  I really want to meet Kid Rock, so I said, what the...  No one's going to have a brain, so...  Well, yeah.  Well, not an ex-murder.  That's true.  And what's your name?  Do you want to give that out?  Mike...  Mike Pelagino. 
[00:55:30]  And where does this...  Ex-doctor.  Ex-doctor.  Ex-doctor.  Where did this brain come from?  What's that?  Where did this brain come from?  Like, who is the guy?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, you don't know?  Yeah, we don't know.  Is there a history on the brain or anything?  No, no.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Abinormal.  But I know.  That old guy.  Abinormal.  Well, it's not a healthy brain, though.  It's a diseased brain.  What is it?  What's wrong with it?  The person had a stroke.  Yeah?  Actually, I can show you that.  Can you see it?  You see the stroke?  Yes, you can.  We're always good with diseased organs.  Hey, why aren't they filming this for the news?  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  I just hope I don't get arrested when I walk out of here.  All right.  Pop that brain up there, and let's take a look.  Let's see.  He keeps it in a nice cooler.  I came prepared.  I brought rubber gloves.  Oh.  Now, is this brain...  Would you be able to take it out?  Is it in something?  It's just in plastic bags.  It's cut so you can see the inside and everything.  Cut in half or quartered or sliced?  It's in half.  Can we hold it?  It's in half.  Sure.  I mean, without the jar.  Just pass it around and laughs.  It's not in a jar.  It's just wrapped up in plastic.  You can take a bite out of it if you want.  Is it in formaldehyde?  They don't use formaldehyde anymore. 
[00:56:30]  What do they use?  I don't know exactly, but it's...  Alcohol.  Yeah.  It's preserved itself.  Let's see.  I bet it stinks, right?  Yeah, this place is going to smell pretty good.  Ah, dude, I can't take brain stuff.  Smell.  No, it's good.  It's really good.  It's a good stink.  Wow.  This doesn't faze me because, you know, I...  That's really a...  Look at that.  In my brain?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Look, it's...  And it's cut right in half.  Yeah, this is...  Hey, is that boiled or something?  It looks like a deli tray.  Dude, is it boiled?  No, it's not.  How is it held together? 
[00:57:00]  This is how it is in your head like this.  Oh, so, uh...  All right.  There's a pair of vellum.  It's cut like that way.  It could be cut the top right off it.  This one, uh...  There's a piece of brain on the thing.  Oh, my God.  The other one's got the stroke.  You ever see a head come apart like that?  He's laughing at you, man.  You ever see brain like that?  How long has this guy been dead?  Whoa, what is that?  Maybe a day.  Six hours.  Yeah, this is a stroke.  How long has this guy been dead?  Dude, is that big hole in the brain part of the stroke?  This is a stroke.  That's what a stroke looks like in a brain? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, that's bad.  Probably from a hypertension and it bled into the brain.  It bled into the brain and it turned...  It's made a big...  It looks like...  There's brain juice all over the place.  The brain is sliced, like the top of it is sliced off, and there's a spot, and it looks  like an oil steam on a driveway.  This is the cerebellum, you know?  Yes, indeed.  And that's the stroke right there, so that's probably what he died from.  Oh, wow.  Probably what he died from.  Yeah, I would say.  Or maybe the knife going through it.  Yeah.  Whoa.  I thought brains came apart, though.  Like, what's holding it together? 
[00:58:00]  No, it's got, like, connective tissue on it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I thought the brain was pretty goopy and it needed the skull and...  No.  No?  It's pretty durable.  Vietnamese ear guy is getting really bummed out.  He's getting nervous because we're kind of captivated by the human brain.  You've got a brain with a stroke in it.  That's rare.  You bring a stroked-out brain.  This is my presentation.  That's what I told the...  Oh, you're making a presentation?  So I'm bending the truth.  We're all learning.  Yeah.  See, we're learning.  See?  I've never seen a brain with a stroke.  You want to hold it, anyone?  No.  You have a glove.  I'd love to hold a brain.  You want to hold the brain? 
[00:58:30]  He's only got one pair of gloves.  Look at the brain juice dripping on the friggin' counter.  And the piece of brain.  What's that wrapped in?  I want to hold brain.  That's just a plastic bag.  No, will I get sick if I touch the old brain?  Yeah, don't touch the brain.  That's not formaldehyde we smell?  No, it's something else.  I don't know the name.  Brain juice.  Rotting flesh.  Rotting brain.  Where's brain?  You can touch it.  What will happen if I lick it?  Sir, you're not touching it with your bare skin.  I don't want you.  You're the med student.  He's a professional.  I'm a professional.  He wasn't touching a brain.  Norton, he was a med student. 
[00:59:00]  That's right.  Don't touch the brain.  Now he's a fellow.  No.  I want to get gloves or something.  I want to hold the old brain.  How have you laughed?  You guys have another pair of gloves?  Then we laughed.  So what do you have to beat a brain or an ear?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Those two guys are definitely in the lead, right, Ant?  Can we put them all together and make a wacky looking person?  Oh, wait.  Who's this guy?  Somebody bring in a chain.  I think we got another one, Norton.  Yeah, I got nothing compared to these guys.  What do you got?  What do you got?  By the way, you got an hour and a half to get down here with your stuff before we give the 
[00:59:30]  I just got a gallstone about.  Oh, that's your mother's gallstone, right?  Can we see it?  Your mother's gallstone.  Jeez, that's...  It's like a big of an egg.  Now, how did you get that?  Like, why do you have it?  Well, we were cleaning out the house and it was there.  Yeah?  Are you serious?  Like, why did she save it?  It was cleaning out the house and, well, because she's dead.  Oh, really?  But she saved it at some point and then you...  Oh, yeah, she took it home because it was so big.  You cleaned out the...  Tip that over a little.  Let me get a quick look.  No, I really don't want to hold it.  Wow, that is big. 
[01:00:00]  It's as big as a bird's egg.  I'll say.  Where did she keep it?  It was just having me in a closet, in a cabinet.  That is weird.  How did you know it was a gallstone when you found it?  Oh, very good.  I knew when she got it out.  Oh, so then you assumed, hey, that must be the gallstone.  I figured with the Mother's Day thing, maybe I could win.  Oh, look, trying to tie it to the holiday.  That's smart.  Tie it into the holiday.  Kind of smart, but brains and ears.  I know.  Vietnam ear guy, that's pretty good.  Now, brain guy, this guy's impressive, too, but we've got to give the Vietnamese ear guy 
[01:00:30]  another chance here.  Anything else you could tell us about the ear?  It's what it is, right?  I think if your story was a little more captivating, then you didn't have us.  No, I think his story's good.  I want a ear.  I want, like, the place.  I want what happened.  Oh, I don't know the place, man.  He was dead, dude.  He never told me, like, the whole story.  Just that, you know, there's a guy who shot him.  And that was it.  And he committed suicide about a few hours ago, man.  He was heading north on the Nung River.  Yeah, the guy was trying to protect a puppy.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  It's a puppy, man.  Have a mango.  All right, well, we're going to figure it all out, right?  Yeah.  Well, the competition's still on.  Still on until about 6 o'clock tonight.  Brain, ear, and gallstone.  And Pat Croce.  And, yeah.  Who brought you, Pat?  Pete Radovich.  Pete.  Your buddy Pete.  Our buddy Pete.  Our old pal Pete Radovich.  All right, you're hanging for a little while, right?  Sure.  Okay, we'll talk more with Pat Croce in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from Philly today. 
[01:01:30]  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this.  I don't want them enjoying it like it's back to me.  Sometimes you want to hear...  Why?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Broadcasting live from Philly today.  In studio, Pat Croce, Anthony.  Yes.  He was telling me the news crews are following him around because they want him to comment  on the Larry Brown Allen Iverson thing. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, is that what they're following you for?  So, Anthony, you're going to speak on my behalf.  I'm going to comment.  All right, they've worked things out, I believe.  That's exactly right.  That's what I've got to say.  Everything's fine.  They've been following him around for a while now, and they realize he's not talking today  either, so they left.  That's it, huh?  And they'll pop up again somewhere else, right?  I thought they were checking out Norton here.  I know.  Star of Spider-Man.  Yeah.  The movie.  Hey, yeah!  Give it to me!  Hell, I know you dissed me on Spider-Man! 
[01:02:30]  I didn't diss you.  I was trying to endear myself to the Philly fans.  What did you say?  I like you very much.  Thanks, and I don't like him.  You remember?  I don't remember.  What happened?  No, don't start.  Oh, you don't forget anything, huh?  No, he doesn't like me.  I'm a big pet.  That's true.  And I had to call him personally and say, hey, man, I'm sorry.  The guy's a little, you know, he's not...  Now that Norton's been in a major motion picture like this, $114 million gross over our  last weekend, he's a little more down-earth. 
[01:03:00]  You get the gross part, right?  Yeah.  He's in it for like three seconds, his catchphrase is on the big screen.  All we're hearing, though, all we're hearing is everybody that goes and sees this movie  now yells stuff out at the screen when Norton's on.  It's hysterical.  We got our animal listeners in there just screaming, crinkle, crinkle.  Yeah.  You got a Spider-Man tattoo yet?  No, I haven't seen the film.  You know what?  Right on your elbow, like the ex-cons do, just get that Spider-Man.  The spider web?  Yeah.  I can do it for you.  We can do it right now. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know about that Spider-Man.  That's a little scary.  You can't wear the short sleeves to the job interviews at IBM when you got the big spider  web on your elbows.  What does it mean when you have a spider web?  Does it mean anything, or is it just a tattoo?  It's like, you know, the teardrops are supposed to be you've killed somebody.  It used to be just a signet that you were in jail.  Oh, really?  Oh, is that it?  How do you know that?  I never knew that.  I think the chin tattoo on my back would be the camera that I was in jail.  So now that all the guys left the studio, who's in the lead?  Dude, I've got to give it to Brain Guy. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, it's close.  Brain with stroke?  Vietnam ear thing is great.  If it was a normal brain, okay, but with a stroke, that's something you don't see every  day.  You know something?  I like Gook ear, but I wanted more.  He could have talked it up more.  It might not be an ear.  It's an ear.  No, that's an ear.  It might not be.  That's a petrified ear.  It might not be Vietnam ear.  I believe the guy.  I believe the guy.  I just wanted more of a story.  There he was, you know?  Mekong Delta.  I want a story behind him.  Then again, a brain is, when you think about it, though, a brain is easier to get a brain 
[01:04:30]  out of a lab than it is to grab an ear from there.  We're not talking about easy.  This isn't the easiest thing to bring down contest.  It's something that we see, and the visual impact on us is the guy that shot the guy's  uncle.  I kind of like it.  I wanted the story behind it.  But that goes into my thinking, what makes it interesting.  Like, knowing how hard it was to, that's a rare item, even though that's not a rare  item contest.  It's a weird item contest, but that makes me go out.  Where are you getting a brain?  Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You can't get a brain away from you.  I have an easier time getting a brain than a severed combat ear. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's true.  Hey, look, if somebody could bring in a hot girl that would bang me, I mean, I would  vote for that over anything else.  Now you're talking impossible.  All right, so we're going to give it to the brain with the stroke, right?  So far.  So far.  You've got an hour and a half to get down here to try to win the Kid Rock package,  which is front row tickets.  You meet the guy, and you've got the autographed guitar.  Right.  Pat was telling us about this new sport that's going to be debuting soon, huh?  Pretty cool. 
[01:05:30]  Slam ball.  Slam ball.  Slam ball.  What is this?  That's a good name, isn't it?  Well, I'm telling you, these extreme sports are really taking off.  And that's the whole premise.  And it's a, you know, the guy that created our list, this guy, Mike Tolan, it's the wonder  kind of his group put it together.  And it's in development for two years now.  Check it out.  Think of the floor, basketball floor, spring loaded.  The whole floor gives a little.  But within the confines of the three-point arc, inside, interlayed in the court, are trampolines.  Now, these guys wear skateboard pads on their elbows, knees, and like a vest with a custom-made 
[01:06:00]  helmet.  And it's basketball, but it's full contact.  Uh-oh.  And when these guys hit a tramp, it's over the backboard.  I mean, and they whack them in the air.  It's pretty wild.  That sounds pretty cool.  Now, how high can they get up?  They get up as high as the backboard, top of the backboard.  And they're flying.  Because it is.  It's an extreme sport.  I mean, I love the NBA.  I love it.  Like you, we love NBA ball.  This is just a little different.  It's cool.  It's going to be on the new TNN in August on Saturday night.  I love all the extreme sports, though.  I mean, they're taking off like crazy, too. 
[01:06:30]  They're all becoming, you know, huge stars.  Pat Parnell was the play-by-play guy for this.  Right.  The guy who did the snowboarding in the Olympics.  Right.  Right on.  Now, as long as Vince McMahon has nothing to do with this.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You know what it's like?  Extreme basketball.  Hey, hey, this is like.  Get us open, Anthony, again.  I'm not saying it's the wildest.  I'm just saying it's pretty cool.  I took my 20-year-old son, Michael.  I said, Mike, come on.  You've got to come to L.A. and check this out.  My one-man focus group.  Him and Ben Stiller just hung there and watched all these games because it was wild.  Yeah.  It's contact. 
[01:07:00]  That guy wants to juke you.  You pull like one of those Allen Iverson cross-ups.  The guy just whacks you.  Really?  And then it hits a trampoline and he flies.  Bounces like 20 feet high.  You ever see basketball?  Sounds kind of like basketball with the guys from South Park.  Matt and Trey.  They made a movie called Basketball and it was kind of a wild version of baseball and  basketball combined.  It would be great if you had like certain people like doing full contact but also the handicapped  players in the wheelchairs and they were just knocking them out of the chairs.  You're an awful man. 
[01:07:30]  Let's take that brain.  Let's do a brain transplant.  Can we take Jim's brain out?  We'd get more out of the brain with the stroke than we do out of Norton.  Bunch of people in wheelchairs and one guy playing full contact basketball just knocking  them over and laughing.  Would you pay to see that, Jim?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I'd pay to be the guy knocking them over.  Tickle, tickle.  I can't feel that.  Oh, you know, who wouldn't want to be like Jordan?  Why would you like to be like Jordan and just sail into the air?  Look at Pat helping us out and trying to move forward.  Thank you, Pat.  I got you.  This is what we're stuck with every day. 
[01:08:00]  Pretty much anybody can sail through the air in that circumstance.  We've got a trampoline.  Yeah.  Pretty well.  Sure.  And it's going to hit the network?  Yeah.  And how many teams are you going to roll out?  There's six teams right now and they're all inner city South L.A. guys right now.  You know, the star of it is a guy that looks like Allen Iverson.  His name is Inches.  He's the one you see in all those Nike commercials that does all those ball skills.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy, he's like 5'11 and he can fly.  I mean, he just really, literally flies.  Full 360s flips.  That's cool.  The only problem is when someone's taking you out, you're out. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Rick, anybody else showing up for the contest yet?  Not yet.  We have, no, no, nothing worth bringing up yet?  Nothing to compare to the last three we just saw.  All right, cool.  And we have a huge story in New York today.  Yeah, this guy striking again, this mugger.  Have you heard about this mugger yet, Pat?  No.  That's a lot of fun, this guy.  Jesus, what a sicko.  How many times has he done?  This is the 14th time, Anthony.  I bet he won't strike today, Jim Norton. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, we know where he is today.  You want to read this one in?  Well, we can't say the word.  There's an infinity broadcasting rule that we can't use that M word.  I didn't know you guys followed rules.  Well, we wouldn't, but there's a guy on a button that pushes the button and takes out the words that we say.  You can say it in the paper, but not on the radio.  I know.  How stupid is that?  I should be able to read this verbatim.  So what did Norton do?  Well, it's the so-called, let's just say, self-pleasuring mugger. 
[01:09:30]  How stupid is that?  It's in the paper.  Dump button.  Dump button guy, I'll dump it.  And he's dumping.  Now we sound like we're underwater.  Oh, what can I say?  All right.  So, yeah, this self-pleasuring mugger, a fiend who stalks women before robbing them of their cash and jewelry and sexually satisfying himself in their presence.  He struck for the 14th time.  They can't catch this guy.  The Sickles' latest exploit occurred shortly before 9-15. 
[01:10:00]  It was shortly before 9-15th p.m. Tuesday when he followed a 17-year-old victim to a apartment on University Avenue in the Bronx.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  The Sickles' latest exploits occurred shortly before 9-15th p.m. on Tuesday when he followed a 17-year-old victim to her apartment in the Bronx where he got on the item that brings you upstairs with her in demand of her money and jewelry. 
[01:10:30]  Pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it.  After the frightened victim complied with the suspect's demands, he began self-pleasuring himself in the run of her before running off, sources say. 
[01:11:00]  Crime appears to have been committed by the same depraved suspect who's been on the low, been on the low, been on the low, been on, uncaptured since January 3rd.  It's this guy, he robs the chicks and then spends a little time with them.  Wow.  Jimmy kind of thinks that's nice of the guy.  Yeah.  He don't just rob, he robs and then starts cranking the mule. 
[01:11:30]  That's like going nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Isn't that horrible?  I can't believe they haven't caught him.  Does he use a knife, a gun?  Then they don't actually say he threatens them and demands money.  Maybe it's a bad, maybe it's this bad.  They're all thinking it's a bad or a billy club, right?  And then he just starts cranking it and then runs off.  Now, we heard about this guy earlier and he left DNA, they said, on the front stoop of a woman's apartment building. 
[01:12:00]  So he did finish that time.  At least you know he's not going to do it twice in a row.  So, once he robs once, he's probably done for at least 12 hours.  Well, maybe you, Norton.  How old do you think this guy is?  Takes you 12 hours to recharge?  I wonder how Norton knows that.  Yeah.  If I did that, I would be caught up to the first time so I would just lay on the stoop and sleep.  Suspect found that laying on the stoop asleep identified as Jim Norton, star of the movie Spider-Man. 
[01:12:30]  Could you just tweak my nipple?  I know I've taken your jewelry.  Just rub it.  How did he get in the movie Spider-Man?  I know.  Isn't that amazing?  I auditioned for the part.  Because he likes to throw web.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could throw some web.  He did audition and then he gets the part.  You know, Pat is standing there trying to figure you out, Jim.  Yeah, he really is.  He wants to like me.  Well, who doesn't?  But he's just like, eh. 
[01:13:00]  He enjoys you.  At a certain level, he does.  But he can't really admit that to anybody.  I'll take one.  He's a big TV star now.  He can't admit that.  What's your turnaround time, Jim?  You know, I'm brutal.  I can wait a while, though.  I mean, I can hold off, you know.  What's your turnaround time?  Hours.  Hours.  I'm telling you.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, but it takes me a long time on the first one.  Well, forget about it.  I have no desire to go second.  You're all front loaded.  Exactly.  No back loading.  Not money in front for signing. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  That's all it is.  And that's it?  Your turnaround is...  It's awful.  My turnaround stinks.  Have you ever been embarrassed where it's like, come on, let's go again, and you're just  like the noodle?  You got the wrong guy, sweetie.  No, I'm not embarrassed.  No, they're lucky I'm letting them stay there.  Letting them live.  No.  By that time, they're dead and chopped up in the 55-gallon drum anyway.  No, I'm not embarrassed.  On the side of the turnpike.  Really?  Can you go again?  Nope.  See you later.  Yeah, Rex, good.  Good.  Go back to him.  Bye. 
[01:14:00]  It seems to me that...  Oh, Frank was better, huh?  Oh, Frank was better?  It seems to me turnaround time is kind of important.  That turnaround time is overrated.  Really?  Yeah.  After you're done, though?  No, never.  No.  That's a touchy situation.  But some guys, they don't have a good turnaround time, but they want to continue pleasuring.  And they get a mouthful.  No, I...  No, you go...  You take care of that.  I will, actually.  After I'm there, I'll actually...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll be a good guy. 
[01:14:30]  I'm a good guy.  Even after you're through, you'll still go...  It depends on where I finish.  Lap up some goodness?  It depends on where I finish.  Pat, comment?  That is in shock.  We're always trying to dig a little deeper into what Jimmy is on.  I want to know when he's doing number 15.  If you finish on the outside, sure you go back.  Oh, all right.  I got you.  Then you're like, nah, it can't happen.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, it's just...  It's a bleachy, awful mess down there.  I don't need that. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  No turnaround time with Jimmy.  You learned something today.  Yes, Pat.  20 cities are hearing this right now.  Yes.  Let them hear.  Let them know.  I'm not going to lie.  These guys are like, I'll do it now.  I'm all right.  Steve is bringing up a guy that doesn't have a belly button for the contest.  How'd that happen?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  We'll find out in a minute or two.  And don't we have a lovely lady that is here, and her friend is on the way?  Oh, that's Taylor from the Dory 90s.  And they're going to do a little something, are they?  Nice.  This better get hardcore.  A show.  A little show.  A little show.  All right. 
[01:15:30]  A little show.  I like it.  I like it.  I don't know what this show is, but, hon, I won't be home for dinner.  There you go.  Here he is, Steve.  You got the guy?  Yeah.  Belly button guy?  He got him.  So bad.  All right.  The guy with no belly button is making his way into the studio.  He's taking lima bean cheeks.  Did he tell you why he has no belly button?  You don't have a belly button?  Hey, dude.  What happened?  Hey, Fez.  Hey, come here.  Hey. 
[01:16:00]  Give him a microphone.  What's your name, bro?  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Dave.  South Jersey.  Nice.  Okay.  South Jersey.  What happened that you don't have a belly button?  Hernia operation.  Hernia operation.  What?  You had a herniated belly button?  Ten weeks old.  And what did they...  When you were ten weeks old.  And what did they have to do?  Remove...  Just cut through.  They cut through and then sewed it up so it...  Yeah.  Couldn't they make you one?  Whoa!  That's weird.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  He doesn't have a belly button.  That is odd.  You're an alien. 
[01:16:30]  Aliens don't have belly buttons.  Couldn't they make a belly button for you?  Sorry.  He's cursing, though.  He doesn't know belly button, but potty mouth.  Can they at least paint one like the Roadrunner used to do?  Yeah, you know.  Tattoo one on there.  Doesn't even have a dimple.  Nothing.  That's...  Let me see it.  Let me see that.  Wow.  That is really weird.  There is nothing there.  And there's no scar from one, either.  Because he was so young, right?  You see where it's supposed to be, and there's nothing there.  Certainly no ab muscles. 
[01:17:00]  Jesus Norton.  What did they say?  Did you get a honey and lift it a sandwich?  Oh, God damn.  Isn't he horrible?  Star of Spider-Man there.  Yeah.  I was a sidekick.  Did it...  Of course, you've had this your whole life.  Did it shock the ladies, maybe, when you...  You know...  Some, yeah.  When he brought them in the van that said,  if this van's a-rockin', don't come knockin'.  Playing some Leonard Skinner back in the old days.  Question be rephrased.  Does it shock the occasional prostitute? 
[01:17:30]  Wouldn't it?  You know what I mean now.  Does it ever...  Do you have to say, like, beforehand, look, uh...  By the way, I'm a little, you know, off.  I don't have a belly button.  It's been a long time.  I've been married for 17 years.  And what happened...  Okay, let's take your wife, for example.  Prior to that.  Did you tell her first, before you, uh...  Undressed before her the first time?  I'm sure I did.  Yeah?  Come on, you remember that.  Work into the, uh...  Go ahead, find it.  Oh, you used it.  Find what?  Lower, lower.  Yeah, go ahead, find it. 
[01:18:00]  Find that, too?  No, not that.  Next thing you know, she's like,  Where the hell do I spit my gum?  Everybody laughs.  Well, that's pretty impressive.  That's pretty good.  I've never, uh, seen that before.  And he didn't even have to bring anything with him.  I think he wins if we get to dig in a belly button.  That would be nice.  Oh, scalpel.  We'll get that, uh, medical student in there.  He'll gouge one out for you.  Yeah, that's quite all right.  That's gotta be great on cleanup, though.  Because, you know, the worst part is dolloping out of the old belly button.  This guy's got his whole little straight wipe and all. 
[01:18:30]  I'm not finished.  No lint.  Yeah.  Forget the old, I'll be over in five minutes.  No dolloping required.  You should get it pierced so it can just look ridiculous.  I thought about going into one of those piercing places.  Yeah, I want my belly button pierced and lift it up.  It looks like lint on there, isn't it?  That's wacky.  Wouldn't that be insane, though?  We'll videotape it.  We should do that.  Hey, pierce his belly button.  Oh, we don't have one.  That's the gag.  All right.  Very good.  Good job.  Okay.  You're in contention. 
[01:19:00]  Thanks, guys.  The voting will be later.  Yeah, you've got about a little over an hour to get down here for the contest.  Hey!  The Kid Rod package.  Oh, yeah.  You totally...  Oh, you got him so bad.  You can't do that to a guy that doesn't have a belly button.  Oh, dude, and the...  Oh, could you please...  That's what he does to people when they're leaving and then just turns around and they  look, they look, they...  Like, did someone call me?  He's such a prick.  Pat really wants to drive his elbow into my teeth.  And well, he should.  No way.  And well, he should.  I think you're enjoyable.  I've got to see your act on the road. 
[01:19:30]  Very good.  Love to have you.  I'm reading instant feedback.  It's Steve from Philly.  I work at the TV station upstairs from WYSP, where you guys are broadcasting from.  I thought you would like this story.  I was on the elevator with a bunch of people and we stop on the WYSP floor.  As the doors were closing, Norton walked by and yelled, hey, hold that elevator.  I knew who he was and didn't jump, but one guy hurt his hand trying to hold the door for him.  I did do that walking by. 
[01:20:00]  I'm like, could you hold the elevator?  And then he just keeps walking.  Oh, that's great.  And I hope he's a pianist and his life is ruined.  I like the new bathroom one is great.  Whenever somebody goes, excuse me, where's the restroom?  Jimmy, you go, yeah, straight up.  Make a left.  And it's the first door on the right.  And it turns out to be people's offices or the kitchen.  He's a prick.  Florentine.  I have to credit.  I got that from Florentine.  And the greatest one ever is I was taking a dump one time in a gig we were doing. 
[01:20:30]  And he comes in and he shuts the light out.  And you ever sit there in a bathroom alone taking a dump?  It's nice, ain't it?  Florentine.  Don't push it.  He's starting to like you.  Pat's starting to like you.  I can tell.  I do like Pat.  All right.  He's going to be around.  He likes us.  He's going to be on our show.  Wow.  You saw him as a karate expert, yes.  Yeah, he'll kick your ass.  All right.  Hopefully.  We're going to take a break, Ant.  You've got a little over an hour to get down here with your strange stuff to try to win  the front row tickets to see Kid Rock.  You meet Kid Rock.  You've got the autographed guitar from Kid Rock. 
[01:21:00]  Hopefully he's stopping by today.  He was supposed to, but things are in the work.  And we're trying to work it out as we speak.  We'll see.  We'll see, okay?  And we're going to give that away around 6.15 so we can get you to the show tonight.  We're all going to the show tonight.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  After the radio show.  I've got to thank Pat Croce for stopping by.  Thanks, Ant.  Always a lot of fun, Pat.  Thanks, man.  Jimmy Spider-Man, you're...  Goodbye.  He just punches him.  Next time you're in New York, stop by and say hi, okay?  You got it.  Always a pleasure with Pat Croce.  We'll be back.  You've got a war face? 
[01:21:30]  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh!  Oh, s***.  You didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  We're coming.  Jackass.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcasted live from Philly. 
[01:22:00]  Where are we at, Anthony?  Where are we at?  We're doing the strangest thing you can bring us as we broadcast here in Philly today.  Yeah, we're trying to see if people from Philly can outdo the people from Boston, from New  York.  And they're doing a pretty good job.  A gook ear is pretty good.  A brain is pretty good.  A brain with a stroke.  The stroke brain.  Cut in half.  Like you said, the top half of the brain is sliced off and then it looks like a little  oil slick.  Maybe a little like ice rink.  Oh, yeah.  With black ice.  You know what I mean? 
[01:22:30]  It was very shiny and slick.  The old pig test you don't forget.  Yeah, that was okay.  You know, I'm not going to sit here and talk up every one of them.  Yeah, we did have the pig test.  The brain pretty good.  We had the mom gallstone.  Yeah, that was a little odd.  That was odd.  That was a little Norman Bates-ish.  Yeah, the guy's mom dies and they clean out the house and, I don't know, tucked away  is a jar with her gallstone.  I know if, you know, if my mom wasn't with us any longer and there was some body part that 
[01:23:00]  had been removed during a surgery, I'd probably be a little freaked out about it and maybe bury  it or something.  What are you selling at a garage sale?  As, what, paperweight?  Nah, just like, hey, look.  Mom's gallstone?  Yeah, it's too depressing to look at.  It's four bucks.  It would be a little.  I would think it would be depressing to look at.  And then we had the guy with no belly button.  That's odd.  He didn't bring anything.  Someone called up and said, you know, the reason he doesn't have a belly button is because  he was a test tube baby.  Test tube baby.  The guy's shaking his head. 
[01:23:30]  Was he lying to us?  No.  Are you a test tube baby?  No, okay.  Test tube babies have belly buttons?  No, they don't.  Yes, they do, idiot.  No, they don't.  Yes, they do, idiot.  And they wear black pinnit men.  Maybe the guy's a clone or something.  They don't grow them in the test tube.  No, but there's...  All right.  All right.  Jim, shut up.  So that's where we're at.  It is great.  And the Phillies got an hour to try to beat New York City, Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  Uh-huh.  Our hometown.  Yes.  We had a guy bring down a cancerous breast.  Cancer breast was great.  A very big cancerous breast and cancerous esophagus.  Esophagus.  It looked like beef jerky.  And then we had some pickled punks that made their way to our studio in New York.  Little fetus.  And I got to say, Boston in second place.  Yeah.  With the guy that brought the splint.  Well, I don't know, man.  Stroke brain's pretty good.  Yeah.  But it was his own spleen.  That's kind of cool. 
[01:24:30]  It wasn't just like, hey, I found this spleen on a shelf.  The guy...  It was his spleen.  Look, you can hear all of Boston yelling right now.  Yeah, that's right, Ed.  Yeah.  I'm helping him out.  So we'll see.  And we're going to do this whole contest in Washington tomorrow.  Washington.  We're doing this show, then we're going to the Kid Rock show, and then we're all jumping  in our cars and driving real fast to D.C. tonight.  All hammered in.  Are we all going tonight?  Yeah.  What the hell?  Because I figured it out.  I think I'm going tonight.  Yeah.  You know, yep.  Our first visit to D.C. tomorrow, we're looking for a huge crowd.  We're looking for a lot of support. 
[01:25:00]  All you guys that said, hey, man, we support the show.  We're digging you.  We want to see you tomorrow.  Come on out.  It's always a party when we come to town.  And we'll be doing the same contest tomorrow.  So, money snatch audio.  We'll get to it, Rick.  We'll get to it.  The other thing, really fast, we've got to talk about the 2002 Celebrity Softball  Game.  It's shaping up to be a fine, fine game.  A lot more than just a softball game.  This is going to be a huge get-together, a be-in.  If you were at the one two years ago, and everyone had fun at that one, this one is going to be, I would have to say, four or five times better. 
[01:25:30]  Easily.  The mistake we made last time, I believe, is just giving them a softball game.  You know what I mean?  Sure, it's fun to see everybody from the show play softball.  But when you're getting an ass-trouncing, like my team got, it gets like, all right, what are we watching here?  We better start the riot early.  You know, that's what the audience said last game.  And we never even got to give out the final prizes. 
[01:26:00]  No, but we've got a lot of things in place this time around.  We're going to bring the hot Melissa from Philly, and she's going to be giving out prizes in between innings, Anthony.  Good.  See?  We're getting a little smarter.  A little smarter.  So while we're doing that boring, warming up our arms in between innings, she's going to be looking all hot and stuff and giving out prizes.  And then we've got the Titanic slide that we're bringing there.  We've got the Frenchie dunking booth.  We've got hot chicks.  Well, we have to still get these girls, don't we?  We have a lot of work ahead of us. 
[01:26:30]  We have ringers.  We have some girls that are going to come down that we know already.  Yeah.  We're going to start Monday.  We're going to start drafting the teams.  We're going to start having open tryouts for the hot girls to be on the sidelines in their little bikinis.  Maybe I ought to mention this.  It's a legal issue.  Any of the girls that participated in yesterday's contest, you can't participate in this.  You can't come.  I'm sorry.  It's a legal issue.  We'd love to have you.  Stop.  But what?  They were lovely.  That's what I'm saying.  A couple of them, I would love for them to be cheerleaders. 
[01:27:00]  What are you kidding?  Which two?  You know who you are.  Which two?  Which two, eh?  The really hot ones?  Which two?  You know which ones I'm talking about.  Which two girls from the Money Snatch contest did you enjoy yesterday?  The hot ones.  Look, I'm on the internet.  I got all the girls.  Their faces and names.  Let me pop up that site because I got it right here.  All right.  There they are.  All right.  Dude, girls are not going to come by to do stuff for us.  This one would have been good.  All right.  What's her name?  And this one.  What's her name?  No, that one. 
[01:27:30]  Where's the other one?  What's her name?  Just give me a name.  What?  Excuse me?  Give me a name.  They're right there.  Look, I can make this one better just by doing this.  Hmm?  All right.  Stop.  I'll put my thumb in the way.  Stop.  Wide.  All right.  Also, Anthony, we're still working on it, but I think one of our listeners...  Well, no.  We're going to have 10 listeners try to win $25,000 during the Celebrity Softball game.  Yeah.  And then we're going to have a concourse set up with little games and things you can do, right?  How about the slip and slide, baby oil slip and slide with the cheerleader chicks? 
[01:28:00]  Well, we're working on that.  What's the matter?  Is there a problem?  Well, yeah.  Why?  What's the problem?  Rick Serone has a little problem with our...  What?  With our bikini slip and slide oil thing.  But it's just girls slipping in oil.  Ben?  Ben?  Problem?  He's shaking his head no.  I don't make it happen.  Why?  How can we make it happen?  How about if we sprinkle a little crushed glass on it and they slide through that?  Well, we'll get them on the phone when we're back in New York and we'll try to negotiate, work something out.  Interesting.  Interesting.  All right.  Anthony, it's going to be a lot of fun. 
[01:28:30]  It really is.  It's the 2002 Opie and Anthony Celebrity Softball game.  It goes down Saturday, June 1st at Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears baseball team.  This stadium is unbelievable.  It's gorgeous.  It's sponsored by Coors Light and tickets are on sale now.  They're only $10.  You can get them through Ticketmaster.  Ben was telling me before the show today, less than 500 tickets remain.  That's it?  That is it.  They're going really fast.  So you can get them through Ticketmaster or the Riverfront Stadium box office.  You go there, you save the old service charge. 
[01:29:00]  They're going like hotcakes.  Hotcakes, Anthony.  I think.  Like the hotcakes.  Yes.  Can I go to the other phone bank?  Because there's a guy or a girl.  I've got to get to see who it is exactly.  They're driving from Cleveland, Anthony, to see us tomorrow.  From Cleveland?  Because they have given up on us making a trip to Cleveland.  Let's talk to Dave on Line 8.  I feel bad.  We should go to Cleveland.  Yep.  David, what's up?  Gentlemen, what's going on?  Yeah, ma'am.  You tell us, bro.  Hey, you guys suck.  I've got to drive all the way to D.C. to see you guys. 
[01:29:30]  You guys are almost there.  Just keep going a little bit more.  You guys are making it to Cleveland?  No, it's kind of.  Yeah, we're going like south.  The wrong direction.  No, no.  Get a map.  We're in Philly and we're going to go south now.  I'm kind of like, yeah.  Do me a favor.  Come on.  We're dying here.  Everybody wants to see you guys.  Are you seeing Norton's show?  Had tickets.  No, for D.C.?  No.  Hello?  Hello?  For Cleveland.  For Cleveland.  David?  Yes, sir. 
[01:30:00]  He's playing in D.C. tomorrow.  Yeah, we don't have tickets for that.  We don't know where you guys are going to be at.  Don't have the address or anything like that.  All right.  David?  David?  Yes, sir?  You're killing us.  You guys are killing me.  You're taking all the energy out of the show and we're starting to fall asleep.  Oh, we'll see you tomorrow then.  Where are you guys at?  We don't even know the address.  Just keep driving.  Keep driving.  All right.  He's gone.  All right.  Where's Taylor for the Naughty Nighty Contest? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, bring her in.  Bring her in.  When all else fails, I'll be bringing the girls.  Bring in.  When the phone call goes bad, bringing the slut.  Bring in the girl.  Jesus.  Holy.  I don't remember you looking this good.  Wow.  We.  You had.  You know what?  You got a bum rap in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  For what?  Your pictures did not do you justice.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Rick, are we taking more pictures of, I forget.  There's a little shoot right here.  I'm trying to remember the pictures now. 
[01:31:00]  How were you posed?  The best one, I think, was the one where I was on my back on the banner.  Oh, on the wow banner.  Right?  Remember?  Yeah.  And that was not on.  So maybe take that.  Yeah.  Wow.  Your shoulder just a minute.  Thank you, Rick.  Nice.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Wow.  Wait.  Yeah.  The pictures we got of you did not do that body justice.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  The lights were all messed up.  They were.  You would have been right there.  And you're all tanned now, too.  You weren't tanned, were you? 
[01:31:30]  A little bit.  A little?  Yeah.  Wow.  And it helped your cause that.  We got to see all the effing videos of you.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Some of those.  That was a nice little treat.  Hubba hubba.  You're a good egg.  We did the Naughty Naughty Contest, and then we get back to New York and stuff, and one  of the, I don't know, our listeners from Philly writes, hey, you realize she's got a website,  and she's doing all this effing and stuff, and we spent hours on it.  I'm glad you were there.  What were some of the features on those videos?  Some that made us go, wow. 
[01:32:00]  Pre-breast implants.  Oh, okay.  That was pretty good, but that's, you can't even tell you've got a boob job.  They're perfect.  They're really nice, and then, good Lord.  And she likes showing them off.  Yeah.  Those are lovely.  Hey, you want to, we like sharing with our listeners, you want to go outside real fast  and show them?  Show those animals?  All right, Steve?  Yeah.  And then we'll have her back up.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear that?  What?  They didn't hear it yet.  They're screaming. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, no, no.  They didn't hear that.  Well, aren't they on the lay outside?  No, no, no.  Wait, what?  Hey, can we open a window?  Is there any way to open a window so Anthony and I can talk to them and get their reaction?  Wow.  No, they are hearing it live.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  They're hearing it live.  Does that mean they like me?  Hey, guys, do you want to see her boobs?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  There's got to be a few hundred people out there.  You can't hear it on the radio, but they're screaming.  I'm hearing them screaming through. 
[01:33:00]  Can we open up a window real fast?  They don't open?  No, they don't open.  Oh, that's sick.  Well, you know what?  Oh, here we go.  Hey, guys.  You want to see this girl's boobs?  Yeah!  Wow.  All right.  We're sending her down.  There's a pinball machine out there.  Yeah!  All right.  Some guy pulled his pants down.  All right!  All right!  All right!  All right!  There you go.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  She'll make her way down and share.  Share with our audience.  Yes.  Get her down there right away.  We'll know exactly when she's down there because they'll go nuts.  We'll keep the mic up.  Norton's an ass man.  He'd love to see.  He's too shy.  You're bringing a friend, right?  She's on her way.  She's on her way.  Hold on a second.  There's my camera.  Wow-wee.  What do you think, Norton?  Yeah, her body is perfect.  What do I think?  Yeah.  I'd kill my family for that.  You're crying. 
[01:34:00]  Are you all right?  Dude, where was she for the money snatcher contest?  That was so nice.  Where was she for the naughty 90?  She was in it.  I know, but I don't remember this.  The pictures really stunk.  I'd follow you around with a toilet seat over my face.  I'll tell you this much.  You should kill whoever took your pictures.  We're doing a wow contest in the very near future.  So you'll be in it again.  Yes, I will.  And we'll make sure we get better pictures of you.  Steve's taking video right now for foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  All right.  Get her down right away because we've got to share with our listeners that are hanging outside 
[01:34:30]  the studio today.  You suck, Jim.  That is not nice.  And Ben just laughs his ass off every single time.  Ben is the problem.  He's the one egging me on.  He's like, I got to get it.  All right.  Stop doing visual Ben impressions that only three guys are getting right now.  Wow.  She looked a lot different in the pictures.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Because I remember going through the process, the judging and everything. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  And we were like, oh, yeah, she's OK.  Now you see it like that.  Forget about it.  That's like top friggin' five.  Oh, Anthony, I was just handed a note.  I forgot to tell you.  Philly's own Octane is going to be warming up the crowd at the 2002 Celebrity Softball  game.  There you go.  They're an incredible cover band.  I mean, they play all the music you know and love that WYSP plays and a lot of stations  play that we're on.  That'd be cool.  Definitely.  They're going to be great.  What?  What's wrong, Rick? 
[01:35:30]  What?  I'm freaked out.  About what?  Nothing.  Was that on the sheet?  Yeah.  Oh.  Must be making your way outside.  Hold on.  All right.  We're going to hear a big roar in a minute here.  Uh-oh.  Booze.  Booze are never good.  Steve's out there.  Oh, they're booing Steve?  Booing Steve.  They don't like Steve, man.  Is Steve being a dick to you guys?  Yeah.  Because they know he would just as easy walk out there with a flamethrower and walk back 
[01:36:00]  in.  Steve doesn't like hanging with our listeners.  Hey, you guys.  Steve doesn't like you.  Give him the finger.  Uh-oh.  We lost our feet.  We're going to give Stinky the finger now.  Oh, really?  Stinky finger.  And we lost the feet, I think.  I could hear him through the window.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, man.  I wanted to hear their reaction when they get wowed.  Damn it.  I think they unplugged our microphone or something out there.  Did they?  Are they rioting?  Are they being riotous?  Oh, there we go. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  There we go.  Is she flashing you guys?  No.  No?  No.  Why not?  Put it out of here.  Oh, she's still making her way down there.  You guys sound real desperate out there.  Give her five seconds, you rapist.  She'll be right out.  Let us know.  Let us know when she walks out the door.  That'll be him.  There they go. 
[01:37:00]  There they go.  Don't rush her.  All right.  Don't rush her.  Be nice.  She's the only girl within five blocks of this radio station right now.  She's going to look like a glazed donut.  I'm so glad that guys like this radio show, but come on.  There's got to be a few girls.  Where are the chicks?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, I hear some girls yelling.  Sure.  I heard a couple.  There's got a 14-year-old out there.  All right, well.  Whipple belt!  Whipple belt!  Whipple belt!  Ah! 
[01:37:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  The old ladies over there are disgusting.  Wow.  Hey, ask those two stroke brains what they're looking at.  What are they, two older women?  Yeah.  One more time!  One more time!  One more time!  One more time!  One more time!  Yeah! 
[01:38:00]  Nice!  Yeah, baby!  Oh, Jesus.  Guilty.  Oh, listen to how happy they are, Opie.  Is Jim going to talk to the crowd?  Go ahead, Jim.  Jim is taking a look out the window, and I think he wants to talk to you guys.  Yes, Jim?  Hey, see if the two 70-year-olds back there will wow.  They're walking away.  Those two 70-year-olds might be, you know, fans of the show there, Jim. 
[01:38:30]  Well, see if she'll flash her diaper.  What's she doing?  They're gone.  Oh, they left?  Yeah.  All right.  It's Ben Franklin's wife.  Anthony, less than an hour to go in the Strangest Thing contest.  Yeah, come on.  Step it up.  We're going to do this in D.C. tomorrow for a trip to Hollywood.  So let's not forget about that.  Hollywood.  To see a poison thing.  A poison thing.  You really make it sound thrilling.  Yeah.  Well, it's two nights and three days in Hollywood to attend an exclusive end-of-tour party with 
[01:39:00]  poison at the Roxy Theater.  There you go.  There you go.  Second prize.  First prize is the Laverne and Shirley box set.  She's got her child with her.  What?  What's wrong, Rick?  There's a mom out there with a kid in a stroller, and she just pulled her shirt down.  Nice.  And she's proud of it.  There you go.  Oh, sure.  Trip is Currency of VH1 Classic, the new 24-Hour Music Network.  All right.  Did she just wow?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Nice.  And we're going to continue with the radio show. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, mate.  I think they are just gawking out the window.  Norton is, like, stunned that a woman with a baby is showing her cans.  I'm going to go, it's just the type of breast they are.  There should be a basket on that head.  All right.  We're going to step aside for a few.  Stay there.  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Can we see her, bud?  Let me tell you about my balloon, though.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio's own swag. 
[01:40:00]  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcasting live from Philly today.  What a scene around here, Anthony.  We got, uh, I don't even know.  Did you look out the window?  Yeah, there's a lot of people out there.  It has to be 300 or 400 people out there.  There's a lot of people out there.  The porn star walking around naked.  Uh, the gang from YSP is bringing us, uh, more alcohol and Dunkin' Donuts and wings and ribs.  They're very generous.  Very generous here.  The latest food came from, uh, uh, Hammerheads? 
[01:40:30]  Bill.  Uh, Bill from Hammerheads brought food for listeners.  Ben, are you drunk?  I didn't like that.  And then on Cotman Avenue?  Hey, dude, bring me some food.  All right, so that's where the latest food came from.  Thank you.  We got a girl on the line that wants to try to beat the girl from yesterday as far as that fake orgasm thing goes.  Oh, good luck.  Because that girl yesterday rocked.  We have a girl outside in the middle of that crowd that is now calling on her cell phone. 
[01:41:00]  She just wants to come up here and wow you and I.  Oh.  So, uh, let Megan come on up.  Actually, let's go to Megan on line five.  Hello, Megan.  Hey, Megan.  Hi.  Where are you?  I'm not outside the door.  I can't hear, uh, her at all.  All right, let me turn down the outside mic.  Megan!  What?  Where are you?  I'm right outside the door.  This is the echo.  This is the echo.  Turn down the monitor out there for a second. 
[01:41:30]  Okay, Megan.  Yeah?  We're looking out the window right now.  Uh, raise your hand.  You see her, Jimmy?  Jimmy, your mic's not out.  Walk out by the street a little, Megan.  I can't hear you.  Walk out by the street a little.  Megan, we are looking out the window from above, so raise your hand so we can see what you look like.  You see her, Jimmy?  No.  I won't hear you.  No.  Megan.  I won't hear you.  No.  I won't hear you.  No.  No.  I won't hear you.  No.  There she is.  She's probably standing right by the front door. 
[01:42:00]  Blue shirt.  She has a blue shirt on?  Megan, the back.  Oh, yeah.  She's nice.  Megan.  All right.  Yeah.  Nice hands, too.  You have a blue shirt on?  Yeah.  Nice.  Jim says you look nice, so come on up.  Okay, thanks.  All right.  She's got a strap going down between them, too.  Really?  Hey, Megan.  Megan.  What?  Before you come up here and wow us, you've got to wow our listeners.  I can't hear you.  Before you come up here, you've got to wow the listeners out there.  I want to wow them again?  Okay.  All right. 
[01:42:30]  Again.  Here I go.  Megan?  Megan?  You're terrible, man.  Megan?  Megan?  Yeah.  All right.  Let her up.  She's looking at her phone.  They're looking out the window.  She's looking into her phone.  What happened?  They got me. 
[01:43:00]  In studio, Tim Sabian, who runs all the hosts with the most.  Who runs this mess down here in Philly.  Yeah.  Doing a good job, Tim.  There's pot.  There's porn stars.  There's alcohol all over the place.  Thank you.  We like it.  Only he's not quite like Tom from New Orleans because he doesn't partake in the stuff.  He lets everybody have fun, but he wears the suit.  He's very professional.  He's a shy, quiet guy for the Midwest.  He's like the cool uncle.  Yeah.  He lets him have fun.  It's going to be a dollar here and there.  He's not like ecstasy dad where he's doing it all, you know? 
[01:43:30]  He's not doing it all.  He's just letting the kids have a little fun.  Is that wrong?  No.  It's great.  That's how the station's on.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  What's a couple of gold ones?  I don't know.  You're drunk.  What is a couple of gold ones?  Think about that on the unemployment line.  We're sorry to see Tom from New Orleans go, but we're finding out that the people of New  Orleans is hearing us every day now.  Yeah, I know.  Amazing.  We're actually on the air now that he's been fired.  And we're flying Tom up to throw out the first pitch in our celebrity softball game 
[01:44:00]  if he's not drunk.  He's going to throw his liver.  Now, Tim, you said that you were going, we misunderstood what you said.  We thought you were having dinner with Kid Rock.  Yeah, Kid Stevens.  He said, yeah, Kid Rock is coming in and, well, we're going out to dinner and then we'll  see you at the Kid Rock concert.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Tim Sabian, Kid Rock, Pam Anderson sitting there at the table?  No.  And then he informs you, no, it's Ken Stevens.  Ken Rock is the one that you're having dinner with. 
[01:44:30]  Gee, that must just be a treat.  Are you Ken's boy?  Yeah, I'm the man.  I'm the man.  He comes calling and you run out to go pick him up?  We always see each other once a week, so this is my time.  Screw that.  My coveted time.  Hang with him.  Hang with us.  I would.  We're fun.  Tim, we know we could do some great, interesting radio with you, but we got Steve on the line.  Okay, got to go.  Love you.  Why don't you go pick up our balls?  Oh, no problem.  Thank you for coming down.  Appreciate it.  You're here.  When are you going to come back?  Well.  So let's put it on the calendar now.  Ah, we'll call you.  Okay.  Don't call that out with Ken.  We'll call you. 
[01:45:00]  Work that out.  Are you driving or is Ken driving?  I drive.  You drive?  Could you fasten your seatbelt real quick and before he gets a chance, hit a tree?  No?  Well, work on that.  Look at Tim laughing all uncomfortably.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He got him.  No, see, it doesn't work.  Then Tim pops his head back in thinking he can get Jim that easily.  He came walking all the way.  Dude, Steve-O's on the line.  Finally.  Steve-O, is he still alive?  Let's talk to Steve-O from MTV Jackass.  The last time we talked to Steve-O, he was admitting that he was doing Special K and he 
[01:45:30]  was really effed up and that he might die.  And then he wanted to tell us that circumcisions are not a good thing.  I don't know.  He was in a strange place.  But it was at the end of the show and we didn't get a chance to talk.  So now we have plenty of time.  Steve-O, how are you?  I'm doing great, man.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Pretty goddamn good.  Where are you calling us from?  Right now I'm calling from Horniman Beach, California.  Yeah, on the beach.  Dude, we've been trying to get a hold of you the last couple of days. 
[01:46:00]  I know, man.  I just crapped out, I guess.  I didn't check my message for the last couple of days, but I never got the call until today.  So I certainly want to apologize for flaking out like that.  Well, what was happening when you called?  Oh, man, I was just having a great time.  And, you know, I just decided on a radio interview.  So I called you guys up and I couldn't believe how fast I got on.  You know, I was absolutely curious about the circumcision business. 
[01:46:30]  And so I am.  First of all, you were doing the special K?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  That's good stuff.  Oh, man, that's awesome.  So I understand that when I come to New York in, what, less than two weeks, May 20th,  that I might be able to pay you guys a visit.  You know, I'm being full-fledged.  You want to come by our show again? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, I think that, I don't know, I think that, like, I got a publisher now, like, I'm a big shot or something.  But I think they're working it out so that it's on.  Well, that would be very cool.  Well, you're cordially invited to come up any time you want, Steve-O.  Yeah, I absolutely look forward to it.  Now, I want to also let all the listeners know.  Yeah, go ahead, Steve-O.  If the chick is so ridiculously fat-not, I'm going to say it sucks.  Right. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  Well, that makes sense.  You're good.  Hey, Steve-O.  You know?  Steve-O.  Yeah.  Are you still banging Henry Rollins' girlfriend?  Oh, man.  I haven't actually seen her since I was in New York.  But I do believe we're bringing her back.  Yeah, she was great, man.  Yeah.  I think it's on now.  So, I'm quite sure that old D will be making an appearance.  D, yeah.  That was her name. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, hot D.  I hear you got a new trick for us, too.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's terrifying.  I hear some kind of beer trick.  Yeah.  You see, yeah, like, uh, I wound up giving it a shot, and I was able to accomplish the  butt chug with the beer bong.  The butt chug.  So, now, what is it?  I don't know if it's the kind of thing I can do that I will every time, but you guys, you  know, unfortunately, are going to have to find out.  How does the butt chug work, Steve-O? 
[01:48:30]  I think you should.  Well, you see, there was an idea I had for a stunt where I wanted to, um, I wanted to  do a 12-ounce beer bong into my nose, you know?  Yeah.  And so, they got me this special beer bong with a nice thin hose that fits in my nostril.  And I did the beer bong chugging the nose, and it was kind of cool, but, you know, I  figured out, right, I'm trying to...  All right, Steve.  I can't believe it.  I got, like, eight ounces in, I think.  Wow.  I put my butt right up over my head, and I tried to fart beer into my mouth. 
[01:49:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  The old beer butt chug.  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Steve-O, Steve-O, Steve-O.  Steve-O.  Steve-O.  Steve-O.  Steve-O.  Steve-O.  Hold on.  Steve-O.  Warning, warning.  Hold on.  Anthony.  What happened?  Nothing.  Can I just need my...  Oh, you need a don't button, right?  No.  Oh, you need that.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Steve-O.  Yeah.  That pretty much didn't get on the air because of the way it was described, you know, the rules 
[01:49:30]  we have to adhere to.  But let me just describe for our listeners what they might have missed when you told  them what that is.  He has this beer bong.  You know what it is?  Like, you can do these huge amounts of beer and stuff.  He wanted to do it up his nose, so it was made with a thin tube, and then he looked at  the tube and thought, I could put this in my balloon knot, you know, right up there, pour  the beer in there.  How many ounces? 
[01:50:00]  I think I was able to actually chug, like, at least six ounces.  All right.  Six ounces of beer.  Maybe eight ounces.  Let's see what happens.  And then he would expel it out of his balloon knot right into his mouth.  Well, I was trying to.  I was only able to kind of spray it on my face a little bit.  Oh, my God.  Was there anything in the beer besides this beer?  No, no, no, no.  It was a nice clean beer.  Yeah, well, not really clean, I guess. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I was pretty excited about the butt chug.  And you're going to attempt this on our show on May 20th?  Yeah, that's right here.  Wow, that would be great.  That would be a showstopper.  That's a showstopper.  We love finding showstoppers.  Steve, what's going on with the circumcision thing you were mentioning?  Oh, yeah, it's just for crying out, you know?  We got these wacky old men making babies cry because they're slicing their wieners up, you know, making their wieners smaller. 
[01:51:00]  And then these old guys are trying to tell me I'm bad for society.  Right.  So you're against.  You know, I mean, these guys are making babies cry, you know.  Right, we understand, Steve.  They're not making wieners anything.  How are they helping society?  It's just funny to watch the baby cry.  Did any of that tell you?  No, no, no, no.  I doubt it.  I'm sure the experiences on this world are the most important ones people do.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, because now we've got to wait for the delay. 
[01:51:30]  Let's take it.  Steve-O, a lot of that didn't make the air against.  Let's just say he's against circumcision.  Yeah, Steve-O is coming out and saying that he's against circumcisions.  He doesn't like the fact that babies are treated this way and it makes them cry and it doesn't give them any advantage lengthwise.  Let's just say that.  And Steve-O is now coming out as an advocate against circumcision, but an advocate for blowing beer into your face. 
[01:52:00]  Dude, you must get the best part.  Yeah.  You must get the best part.  What did you come up with this stuff?  It's great.  I'm a big fan of Steve-O.  I'm going to support that, Steve.  I'm a big fan of your guys.  I'm going to support that.  I'll tell you what, man.  Like, you know, what really sucks, too, is that when I go to New York, you know, I've got this court date because I got caught driving in Los Angeles with no driver's license and a registered car without insurance. 
[01:52:30]  So, you know, the cop thought I was really cool, so he didn't arrest me.  But, you know, I'm going to be rocking with you guys when I should be in court and who knows what's going to happen, but let's make it worthwhile.  They'll just put out a warrant for you.  Don't worry about that.  That's cool.  You're announcing that's 18 cities, Steve-O.  Good job.  You'll miss that court date.  Who cares?  Well, right on, man.  I apologize for making you guys censor me out.  You know, I just tried not to swear, but I don't know the rules very well. 
[01:53:00]  It's all good.  Hey, are you guys working on that Jackass movie?  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm just wrapping up filming right now.  And actually, tomorrow night's my last night filming for the movie.  What's the craziest thing?  We're working on, like, they're saying it's coming out during August.  What's the craziest thing you do?  That's kind of tentative, so.  What's the craziest thing you do in it?  Oh, man.  We'll talk about that when I get there.  All right.  That's cool.  Right on, man.  Hey, you guys, I'm really looking forward to it.  May 20th.  Great.  And I might actually be, I might be terrifying you more than even with the butt chug. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  Hey, you know, we haven't even talked to Steve-O since we saw, watched his DVD.  No, that was good.  Dude, that DVD is off the hook.  Oh, yeah, man.  Thank you guys so much for watching it.  Actually, it's going pretty well.  Like, you know, we're pretty much showing a lot of them, and, you know, everyone's pretty  into it.  I'm dying today.  Our favorite was the vodka IV drip.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  I'm thinking about shooting up some more beers, like maybe with Nikki Sixx.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what I'm hoping to.  But, uh...  Yeah, absolutely, man.  www.stevovideos.com  All right, Steve.  I just figured out where that stroke three just came from.  Check it out.  The movie comes in in August, and I'll be seeing you guys on the 20th.  Great, Steve-O.  All right, Steve-O.  I've got some really, really bad influences in New York that can get me all jacked up before 
[01:54:30]  I come in.  Good, because that's the way we love to have you.  Yeah, I know.  I apologize for just calling you on sober business, but we'll take care of it out on  the 20th.  Hey, Steve-O, how many more years do you plan to live?  I don't know, man.  I'm not planning to die, but, you know, I'm not really expecting to live all that long either.  I'm just letting it ride, dude, you know?  All right.  We hear you.  All right, man.  We'll look forward to seeing you on the 20th.  Yeah, honestly, I think you guys have so much of your time, and, you know, I'll see you  on the 20th. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  All right, thank you, guys.  Oh, Steve.  Yeah.  Hey, that was an easy one, Norton.  Come on, man.  Boy, you're a tough guy.  That guy is tools, man.  I do like him.  That guy is just out of it.  How much longer?  You've got to read about him dying.  You've got to read about that guy dying soon.  I hope not.  I hope not either, but you've got to.  There is not a guy that does this kind of stuff, and does the drugs this guy does, and the 
[01:55:30]  booze, and lives.  He has no fear.  Doesn't happen.  All right.  Megan wants to show her boobs.  Megan, real fast.  Oh, we've got to take a break.  There she comes.  Well, there you go.  All right.  She got a little blue shirt on.  There you go.  All right.  Well, she looks ample.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Are you of age?  Yes.  Okay.  Let's take a look before the break.  It's Megan, everyone.  Here we go. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  Very, very nice.  Are you taking video for the website there?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Good.  We've got to take a quick break.  Megan's wowing.  Yes, she is.  We only have a half hour left in the contest, Anthony.  You want it real fast?  You've got to beat a guy that came by with a brain with a stroke in it.  Yeah.  Pretty much a brain.  It was at the top cut off of the brain.  So, you could see inside.  And this brain, it had a stroke.  So, it had a big spot in it.  And a stroke brain is pretty much in the lead right now.  For the Kid Rock package, which is the autographed guitar, the front row tickets, the meet and greet. 
[01:56:30]  We're all going to the show tonight at the Spectrum after the radio show.  Oh, does this guy want to come up with this?  What, what, what, eh?  Pregnant pig uterus.  Pregnant pig uterus.  Oof.  Interesting.  We've got an eight-foot boa constrictor.  Somebody brought a rich boss CD.  That's too disgusting.  I don't understand the homeless guy crap.  That guy can eat boss's CD.  You know what we'll do?  We'll take a break.  When we get back, we'll check out what is left. 
[01:57:00]  And then we'll declare a winner.  How's that?  Very good.  All right.  Topey and Anthony are the latest shock jobs to hit it big.  Goddamn.  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, says, then you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent.  But I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to. 
[01:57:30]  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance.  None on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  None on us.  And then you say it like this.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show broadcasting live from Philly today.  Tomorrow we head to D.C.  Rock. 
[01:58:00]  Actually, I think we leave for D.C. after the Kid Rock show tonight.  Oh, it's going to be insane.  It's going to be a long, long night.  I'm here in all kinds of different times that it takes to get from Philly to Washington, D.C.  People are going, oh, dude, it's like the trip from New York to Philly, which was an hour and a half.  It was nothing.  And then I'm here, and you make it in two and a half hours.  You call me and let me know because that's impossible.  So now it's sounding like it's like the Boston trip from New York.  What is it?  We're going to have to figure it out. 
[01:58:30]  All I know is late.  We've got meetings.  I mean, they've got a whole schedule for us tomorrow in D.C.  That's why I want to get there.  So late at night after the show, and it's an all-95.  Open it up, baby.  Let's rock.  I'll bet you that we'll do like a gumball rally.  We'll do the cannonball run.  We'll be calling and pranking each other on the road, doing the hang-up game over and  over again.  You're taking Jimmy with you, are you?  Because we're crazy.  He might go with you.  You're taking Jimmy with you, are you?  He might go with you. 
[01:59:00]  Who's taking Jimmy?  I think he wants to go with you.  I'm passing him to you.  No.  He did hint like he goes, dude, if you go tonight, I want to tag along with you.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  We're equal partners here.  I've taken care of Jimmy.  Is that it?  It's your turn.  I don't think I've ever...  Have fun when he starts farting in the car and thinks it's hilarious.  He talks about me.  One slipped out, man, because I, you know, but he just lets him fly.  He doesn't give a flying...  See, I don't enjoy that. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, I know.  That's not fun in a closed vehicle.  I understand that.  All right, Ben.  Ben's handing me a note.  We need to pick the winner for the Kid Rock thing.  Yes, I know that.  I know that might be the showstopper.  I'm on top of things here, Rick.  We got two things.  We got two things.  Steve, give us the first new thing before we revisit something else, if you know what  I mean.  Steve's being helped.  Not that.  Not that.  Not that.  Oh, the new...  Oh, the pig thing. 
[02:00:00]  Let's just put it this way.  A guy really wants his Kid Rock thing, so he's going to be coming back in with his thing  he brought to take it to a whole new level.  Oh, yes.  Oh, okay.  All right, so before that, what do we got?  Gentleman out here with a bucket, large plastic bucket.  In the bucket, I am told, and is a pregnant pig uterus.  Can we F it?  Ugh.  Did I just say that?  Oh, it's the cold medication.  I'm sorry, Opie.  What I meant is, can we see it?  See it.  Can we see it? 
[02:00:30]  See.  See is a letter in the alphabet, as is F.  Right.  So I got confused.  Right.  Hey, bro, what's up?  Hey, dude.  Yeah, put it...  Are you sure it's safe on a chair?  Put it on the floor right, like, as far away from me as is humanly possible.  Pregnant pig uterus.  Hey, what's your name, first of all?  Josh.  Hey, Josh.  How come it's dated 493?  It's often better than an old pregnant pig uterus.  So that's an old...  This is almost 10 years old, huh?  The old pregnant pig uterus, eh?  That pig would have been 10.  Hey, look at that. 
[02:01:00]  Wait, I can't see, man.  It looks like intestines, though.  Yeah.  Maybe you can cut it up.  God damn.  What does it look like, eh?  Where's the little baby?  Dude, you're not going to touch it.  How do you know it's a pregnant pig uterus?  I'll touch it.  It doesn't matter.  It's okay.  I'm so glad I have a cold right now.  Are you an acupuncture?  No.  Hey, what does it look like?  Don't make him touch that, because then we have to touch things that he touched.  Hey, what does it look like?  It looks like intestine.  What's the uterus?  Point to that.  See that intestine-looking thing?  Right here.  No, closest to you.  Yeah, what is that? 
[02:01:30]  They're all in there.  They're all in there?  Yeah, they are.  Oh, so wait, their uterus is kind of long, like a tube?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And those are all...  You see what it is?  I know what it is.  Each one of these is the fetal pig.  That's one.  That's a fetus.  That's one.  Oh, God.  I'm going to run.  Jimmy's packing.  Let me see it.  God damn.  Look at it, Ope.  Wow!  Isn't that a horror?  How many pigs are in there? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, it looks like...  This little piggy.  I'm just thinking of that.  I mean, little piggy.  And where'd you get this thing from?  I don't know.  I found it.  You found it?  Dude, would you rip open that and pull the little baby pig out?  Yeah.  Then make it go wee-wee-wee.  You got a pocket knife?  You got a knife?  Oh, man.  It's sort of stinking here.  Man, so what?  It's a pig uterus.  What do you expect?  Damn it.  You want...  What?  Anyone got a pocket knife?  Knife over there.  Get a plastic knife.  Right over here.  Hold on. 
[02:02:30]  Cut in.  Get a good one.  Look at that bag.  Right here.  Ugh.  They have to drive from Philly to D.C.  Two and a half hours.  It's coming in like crazy.  We got a razor blade.  Didn't we see some smelly pig uterus yesterday?  Yes, it was disqualified.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, Rick.  You know...  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  This is going to be sick.  Dude, he's cutting it with a razor blade.  A scalpel.  A scalpel.  Wow, where'd you get a scalpel from?  A little pig uterus. 
[02:03:00]  What are they, performing surgery here?  All right, what is he doing?  I can't see from here.  Opie, he has a scalpel in his hand.  Yeah.  He is now going to remove one of the little piggies from the uterus.  Look at that.  Pull that little plastic cover off of the...  Don't cut yourself now.  Yes.  Hope someone has some roast beef for him.  Ah.  Oh, my God.  Steve has to take the guy's watch off.  Yeah, because he doesn't want to get it all yucky.  You don't need to cut into the uterus and see what pops out. 
[02:03:30]  Hey, why don't you stick the uterus right there in the corner?  That's a callback.  Look at him.  He's doing this surgery.  Well, don't...  Dude, be delicate.  You could be cutting the little guy's head off.  Yeah.  Oh, look there.  Yeah, peel that back.  He's kind of peeling the wall of this uterus apart where this lump was.  And it's starting to smell more and more.  Oh, look at the little fella.  Does it stink?  Look at the little guy.  This has been in here since 1992? 
[02:04:00]  93.  Am I led to believe?  Little pig tootsies.  Look at the little guy.  God, it's like a little pork sandwich.  Oh, I'm going to throw up.  This is the sickest thing I just saw.  Yes.  He's kind of coming apart.  You ever see a little pig come apart like that?  It's going to take a while.  He's oinking at you, man.  He's oinking.  That's the way the pig laughs at you.  Cutting into another part. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, God.  The part that's submerged.  I want to see a little piggy face.  Yeah, that's a little piglet.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  It's splashing everywhere.  Take it out.  Pull him out.  All right.  Have a laugh with him.  Dude, let him work on that.  Oh, yeah.  Look at his little head.  Wow.  It looks like an alien.  It's a tail.  It's a tail.  Look, it looks like an alien.  That's sick.  Nice.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Dude, that's hysterical.  That's pretty good.  Dude, you are so disturbed.  Pull it out and name it. 
[02:05:00]  There you go.  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  Usually it would take a...  Yeah, look at you.  Don't pull it like that because you never know if it's going to go.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  He just delivered a little pig.  His eyes are closed.  Wow.  Well, smack its little ass until he cries.  Hey, Jim, it's not reality.  How great would that be if I started running around the studio and laughing?  All right.  Well, pig hair.  About time.  I wish he had a little pig hair so I could tussle it. 
[02:05:30]  That's good.  God, that's like that little thing out of Eraserhead.  You ever see the movie Eraserhead?  Wow, that is so cool.  With that little pig looking thing?  Dude, that is twisted.  Would you give a little wet nap?  That's appropriate.  Yeah, wet nap.  Are you a germaphobe?  You don't know what's in there.  It's been floating in, what, preservative for...  What could be in there?  20 years?  10 years?  How'd they get a bite?  10 years.  10 years old.  10 years old, that pig is.  Look at it.  It's a suspended animation.  Yep.  Pageria pig.  Usually, you don't see something like that unless it has a little hanger through its head, 
[02:06:00]  but...  It's cute anyway.  Cute as a button.  All right.  Cute as a button.  Hey, Anthony.  This is where we're at.  Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.  Go downstairs.  Make sure there's no one else, all right?  Okay.  This is the last call, and then we're going to bring one more guy in, and then we've got  to declare a winner here.  Big uterus guy.  Great job, man.  Very good.  We got to...  And I got to say, that holds some weight there.  Not only did he bring it in, but he had the gumption to actually deliver one of the baby 
[02:06:30]  pigs.  We saw a baby pig delivery.  Yes.  Dead baby pig delivery.  Oh, wait, dude.  Oh, gosh.  Funny 100% of the time.  I'm sorry.  All right.  The guy turns around with the bucket and says, huh?  There's a floating pig uterus in that man's bucket.  He's still turning around.  His little lunch pail.  Wow, that was sick, man.  That was really disturbing.  I liked it.  All right.  We'll go back outside.  The guy made something of what he had.  See?  Hey, wait.  I heard some chick out there. 
[02:07:00]  Where's the Hummer chick?  Huh?  What?  She's out there giving treats.  Yeah, she left the area.  I'm not kidding.  No.  There was a girl giving treats outside.  Really?  It was the mom.  The mom.  She had a baby in a stroller, and she's giving treats.  For money?  Was it for money?  Was she taking cash?  I could use treats.  We don't really know the full story, but she has left the area.  You got to pay cash for that, right?  Oh, my God.  Oh, we got a mummified monkey outside.  Monkey mommy.  Monkey mommy. 
[02:07:30]  I want to see monkey mommy.  Steve is going outside to make sure that's about all we have.  And then, you want to get this guy in first?  All right.  Let's do this.  Monkey mommy.  One of the guys is coming back in with his strangest thing.  The guy with the Chow Yun fat hair do.  How are you?  Actually, as I said before, he looks like the pipe bomber kid from the Midwest.  Here's the deal.  If he'll get me to win, I'll take a bite out of my little brother's in Bilical Coor.  Okay.  Well.  Wow.  He came in about two hours ago with his brother's cord. 
[02:08:00]  I don't know how well.  Your brother's, what, eight years younger than you?  Yeah.  And what?  When it fell off him, you guys decided to keep it?  Yeah.  Or you decided to keep it?  Yeah.  For what reason?  We don't know.  And it's been in this jar for the last eight years?  Yep.  And he wants to now take a bite of his...  Holy Jesus.  A little nibble.  A little nibble.  What is it in?  This is rubbing alcohol.  Rubbing alcohol.  He put it in there.  Can't you go blind from that? 
[02:08:30]  I don't know how safe this is.  Do we have a microwave around here?  Hey, microwave it.  Go ahead.  As much as I'd love to see him poison himself, you know, I don't know if that's right.  Yeah, because you've got to think the cord is nice and pickled at this point.  You may just have to drink out of my mule instead, son.  I'll pass.  I'll pass.  Well, how much of a nibble?  I'll just take a bite.  How about take a bite and spit it back out? 
[02:09:00]  Have you seen the clotted blood in that thing?  No, it doesn't bother me.  It doesn't.  Yes, it does, doesn't it?  No, I ate a chicken brain before, son.  You ate a chicken brain.  Why is everyone shaking their head around here?  I'm not shaking my head.  What happened to you guys?  No, I'm fine with it.  Oh, okay.  I'm fine with it.  I just want to make sure this guy, you know.  How about a little stick-to-itiveness?  All right.  You've got it, Jimmy.  What if you took a bite, bit it in half, and chewed it a little?  Yeah.  And then spit it out.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll chew it for about two minutes.  That's pretty cold, dude. 
[02:09:30]  That's sick enough.  That's pretty damn sick.  That's sick.  It's in his mouth.  It's his brother.  It's a part of his brother.  Once you swallow it, game over.  He's got to definitely put me in there, though.  Definitely.  I got to say, you eat your preserved little brother's umbilical cord.  Well, maybe the guy with the gook ear wants to do the same thing.  He was willing to do the same thing.  No way he was going to eat the gook ear.  No, he wasn't.  He had a little bite out of it.  Yeah.  It's like a rock, though.  Isn't it a rock?  Will anybody put their mule into that little pickled pig? 
[02:10:00]  I'll eat it up.  I'll eat it up, dude.  Stop it.  Wait.  Gook ear guy is back.  What will you do?  I'll eat it up.  You will not eat gook ear.  I will eat a gook ear.  I'm not afraid.  It's petrified, though.  I'm not afraid.  How would you eat it?  I'll eat the lobe.  Isn't that like a rock?  Well, it's a little...  Let me see the gook ear again.  Holy Jesus, it's gook ear.  We've got to give this away in a few minutes. 
[02:10:30]  We're going to eat a little lobe.  That's the way the gook laughs at you.  Is Steve outside?  Right here.  Dead monkeys here.  Dude, you're not putting it in your hand, are you?  You see that ear mummified?  Dude, you're not going to get through this.  It's mummified.  It's like a rock.  This is the ear.  Right now, somewhere in hell.  I'm on sevens.  There's some gook in hell going, ah, stop it.  That's very round.  I'll do my best to eat it.  He'll do his best to eat it, Anthony.  All right, look.  Both of these guys want to do something that's really heinous, 
[02:11:00]  but there can only be one winner.  Look, me and a brain guy want to go to the show.  Well, brain guy's in the lead.  Brain guy's willing to take a piece of the brain  if me and him can go to the show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  We're going to do a what with the brain?  All right, everyone.  We will eat it.  All right, where's the dead monkey?  Mummy monkey.  Mummified monkey.  Mummy monkey.  Monkey mummy.  Guys, don't worry.  More breasts on the way for you outside,  so stay right there.  All right. 
[02:11:30]  You hear him all yelling.  You can hear him in the background.  Mummified.  Barry Mahaj kicks ass.  Hey, hold on.  All right, wait.  Get to the microphone.  All right.  Jeff Bright kicks ass.  Go over here.  How is that mummified, sir?  It's not.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't do anything.  Don't do anything.  That is nothing more than a dead monkey, isn't it?  That's it.  That is not a mummified monkey.  That is just dead monkey in a bag.  That is a dead monkey in a bag.  Now, where did you get this monkey?  From a biological store.  And they are made for what? 
[02:12:00]  Dicep.  And did he have the AIDS or anything?  I don't think so.  No, he's just a dead monkey.  And how do they prepare the monkeys for being sold?  Like, you would think he would just rot.  Has he been embalmed?  Are you his uncle?  He has been embalmed.  You know what?  That would make him, Jim.  Ah, forget it.  You just have one at home.  I got a barrel full.  What type of business does he run? 
[02:12:30]  All right, lift up the bag.  Stop throwing a wrench in the works and let him get on with his business.  Lift up the bag.  Wait, don't take it out, though.  No.  Good thing he's not fat.  He'd be ice cream.  Oh, well, let me.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  A dead monkey in a bag.  Dude, he is making.  He's staring at you.  He's in mid-left.  He is making the Han Solo stuck in the carmahite face, isn't he? 
[02:13:00]  Look at the monkey.  It was like.  Dead monkey in a bag on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's good.  Dude, F it and you were in.  Look, his yearning mouth is open.  His yearning monkey mouth.  Look at all the fluids at the bottom of the bag.  Dude, I'll do it.  No, stop it.  He'll do what?  He'll do it.  He'll do what?  Let me see the monkey's face.  Look at his face.  Dude, if this guy will put his mule in a dead monkey's mouth. 
[02:13:30]  You've got out his.  Everyone leave the studio.  We have to have a.  Yeah, we've got to have a powwow.  We have to have a powwow.  I'll figure it out.  Jeff Bright kicks ass.  There you go.  We.  Let me see monkey's face.  Come here.  Let me see monkey's face.  The fluid is the sickest thing.  Just hold it right there.  It don't come any closer.  Let me say.  This is an outbreak.  A little monkey tinkle.  Are we taking digital pictures of all this or just video?  That is frigging disturbing.  Bang.  I'll put the mule in the mouth.  All right.  No, no.  The guy's like, Ant, I will put the mule in the mouth. 
[02:14:00]  He's a Kid Rock fan.  You cannot get a Hummer from a dead monkey.  All right.  Wow.  Look at you in responsibility.  All right.  Get everyone out of the studio.  We've got to have a powwow.  Put that bag in the bag.  We've got to pick a winner.  Wait.  The monkey looked.  Wow.  That was weird, Jim.  Hey, you got the monkey.  Make sure the Hummer chick doesn't go anywhere.  How did it die?  Did someone shock it? 
[02:14:30]  Saney.  Saney.  That's not you.  All right.  Make sure she doesn't go anywhere.  We're going to talk to her in a minute.  Okay.  We've got to figure this all out.  Now, this is what we've got.  We've got the dead monkey in a bag.  Dead monkey in a bag.  Which is pretty damn amazing right there.  That was pretty sick.  Then we've got a guy that has a brain that had a stroke.  Yeah.  He wants to eat a piece of the brain.  Eat a piece of stroke brain.  Then we've got a guy with his brother's cord.  Umbilical cord.  That has been there for years.  Since he was eight years old, he's 13 now. 
[02:15:00]  He wants to eat that.  Just bite off a chunk.  And then the third guy has the gook ear.  And he will do his best to chew through the petrified ear.  His uncle shot in Vietnam.  His buddies, getting revenge for him being shot, grabbed the gook that shot him.  Cut him apart and brought back his ear.  And now, the guy wants to eat the gook's ear.  And I think thrown into the mix, the guy that has the gook ear also said he will put his junk in the dead monkey's open mouth. 
[02:15:30]  And perform that act on the dead monkey's open mouth.  And we've got to pick a winner in three minutes.  What do we do?  We've got to see monkey mouth.  Dead monkey hummer is probably the best.  How do you beat a dead monkey hummer?  I will say, dead monkey hummer beats the eating of anything. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I see.  Dead monkey hummer beats anything.  Wait, let's ask the guys outside maybe.  Oh my God.  Wait, they're...  What?  Dead monkey!  Dead monkey!  They're chanting dead monkey!  Yeah, I think they're...  Dead monkey!  If that guy...  I can't even say it.  All right, get the porn star in here, because I think we need a fluffer.  Taylor!  Oh my God. 
[02:16:30]  How do you...  You know, unfortunately, the pictures won't be up for a while, but if you could see this monkey's face,  his hands are up by the side of his head and in these claw-like things, like he grabbed at the bag and went...  And just opened his mouth, his tongue is sticking out, he's got his fang, his eyes are...  Big bug eyes are just closed, but you can tell they're bulging, and this guy wants to stick his mule.  Oh my God.  All right, we got Taylor in studio with her friend. 
[02:17:00]  Hi.  Hey, how you doing?  We might need your help, because, you know, this guy needs to be prepared.  Hey, who knows, he might enjoy it.  Do you hear what's going on?  Have you been listening a little bit?  No, no.  I have, but I can't really hear it.  Well, this is what we want...  We want you two to maybe put on a little show.  Okay.  So the guy that wants to do what he wants to do to the monkey will be well prepared.  Ready. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  Now, do you just rip a hole in the bag, like a little clear glory hole?  You take it out, you tussle its monkey hair.  Or is he going to grab the little monkey ears and go to town?  Right.  All right, let's bring the...  And then when it's done, the monkey will go...  Let's bring a dead monkey in a bag back in the studio.  Who's your evolutionary successor?  Who's your evolutionary successor? 
[02:18:00]  Oh my God.  Dude, this will go down as the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life.  All right, what's your name again?  Mike.  Mike.  Mike's the guy that brought the gook ear in.  He really wants to meet Kid Rock, obviously.  He brought the gook ear.  He wants to eat gook ear, but at this point, the gook ear is like a rock.  Right.  And they're chanting.  Now, you have said that you would take your mule and get some treats from the dead monkey. 
[02:18:30]  I can't believe I'm saying this.  From the dead monkey.  Now...  If you man have been drinking, I will do my best.  All right, well, that's why we got these two lovely ladies in here.  So you just got to tell us when you're ready.  Ready.  Right.  Where will this happen?  Like, will it be back there?  Will it be here?  Oh, thanks, Anthony.  Where?  Because I just...  Right there.  Who cares?  Right there, kind of...  Right in front of Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Please slap and talk to the...  All right. 
[02:19:00]  Oh my God, this is so bad.  Can I go get prepped, like, somewhere else?  Prepped.  Yeah.  You mean, like...  Well, let's see what Taylor wants to do.  Taylor, can you kind of help him without...  Now, I met her outside.  I mean, you know, we did talk for a little bit.  You can just walk.  Can I get prepped somewhere else?  Is that possible?  Like...  She's shaking her head.  Like, down over there.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  They got to dump out of that now.  That is to erase the...  As long as you met her.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Logically, that makes sense.  Makes perfect sense.  No, we're not even talking about taking it to that extreme.  It's just...  I think...  I think...  Jeff Wright rules.  If he's doing whatever he needs to do to prep, and you are just there as a visual aid...  That's what we're saying.  That's all we're saying.  With your girlfriend.  You know, I hate to be a C-blocker for you, pal.  I understand.  But all I'm saying is, you know, we don't want to put her in a position where she feels  she's obligated to do certain things to you. 
[02:20:00]  The thing is, I already told her...  And the monkey might get jealous.  I already told her that I joined the website.  So...  Well, we've got to give out Taylor's website as well, so...  Effingfree.com.  All right.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Man, we've got to do all this in five minutes, because then you've got to go right to the  spectrum to meet Kid Rock.  Dude, I'm so stoked for going to meet Kid Rock.  Taylor, are you in or what?  We'll give plugs to your website like you won't be.  All right.  Here's another problem.  That goddamn monkey fluid in the bottom of that bag is probably really bad. 
[02:20:30]  That's probably not good.  All right.  What about this?  Yeah.  What if I took a sip of the monkey fluid?  No.  No.  Because you would die.  Okay.  That's not even nearly as hard as what you're going to do.  Forget about the foreplay, my friend.  You're going right for it.  I believe if you just tear a small...  Not right now.  I'm talking at the absolute last minute.  You tear a small hole right by that monkey's face.  No.  Take the razor blade when we're ready.  Yeah.  And then cut a little hole by monkey mouth. 
[02:21:00]  And if we're going to do this, we've got to do this right now.  I know.  I'm just trying to get everything organized and get this set up so we can do it.  Where do you guys want to go?  You want to go back there and just yell ready when you're ready?  Go back by that corner.  All right.  All you need is go back there.  I've got two friends with me.  Is that possible to do?  To what?  No.  Hurry up.  No.  No.  This is just for like...  Two people.  You and a friend.  Two people.  That's all we got.  That's all we got.  Okay.  That's all we got.  All right.  Go back and...  Show that monkey who's born.  Go back and prep.  Go back.  You have visual aid over there for him. 
[02:21:30]  And...  Oh, my God.  He's going to...  All right, Anthony.  Quick.  Somebody get me a monkey suit.  A monkey suit.  I was just out front.  Some guy gave me a four-legged chicken.  Four-legged chicken.  A four-legged chicken embryo.  It looks like a urine sample.  Dude, um...  A little too late.  It's a little late.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's what I said.  He should just give it to him.  It's a gift from him to you.  Here you go.  Hey, what's going on back there?  He's got to go to the bathroom. 
[02:22:00]  The guy's got to go to the bathroom.  Make it snappy.  Hurry up, fella.  Go take it.  Definitely gay.  Make sure the guy knows we've got to get him out of here in like five minutes.  Holy Jesus.  Quit monkeying around.  That was Garrett's.  Quit monkeying around.  Very good, Garrett.  Awesome.  Give that hair a tussle.  This is just wrong.  It is the worst thing I'm even thinking of saying.  I've never, ever dreamt that we would have a situation.  Put the monkey back in the bed. 
[02:22:30]  That's where we differ.  I have dreamt of...  Can we talk to the Hummer girl?  Bed, bed, bed.  Yeah, let's do that.  The Hummer girl.  I've got to get back to the yellow phone screen.  Man.  Line seven on...  Hello?  Sandy.  Or Saney.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Saney.  Saney.  You were outside...  Saney.  J-A-M-I-A.  Oh, Jamie.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  You were outside the studio?  I was.  I left.  You left.  What happened?  Huh?  What were you doing out there? 
[02:23:00]  Well, I ran into an old friend of mine.  Yeah.  And I just...  I had to give him a Hummer for old time's sake.  You know, it just had to happen.  His name's...  Right outside the studio.  He's the man.  So you started giving him little treats?  Yeah.  In front of what?  Like 300 guys?  Yep.  As soon as I said it, like I had to circle guys around me.  And then, uh...  Was that your kid there, too?  Yes, it is.  How old's the kid?  Fifteen months. 
[02:23:30]  Fifteen months in a stroller, and you were, um...  Satisfying a man.  An old friend.  God, we've got to come back to Philly next week.  Yeah, you're a good friend.  And just to let you know, I asked Tanya if I could come up and see you guys,  because it was going to be yours, but you never brought me up.  Ah, we got monkeys.  We don't care.  We could, um...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Jesus.  Put a little hair on his body.  Tussle, tussle. 
[02:24:00]  The good thing about monkeys, you can tussle their butts.  They're hairy all over.  That's only his foot, but it's tussleable.  Well, thanks for doing that outside the station today.  Yeah.  Not a problem at all.  You guys rock.  I had a great time.  All right, cool.  We got to let you go.  Jimmy, I love you.  All right.  We got to let you go, because the girls are doing their thing in the back of the studio,  getting the other guy ready for the dead monkey in a bag.  What the hell's going on there?  You can't do it. 
[02:24:30]  I will.  A little show that Steve is filming for, foundrymusic.com.  Two lovely ladies just going at each other in a very sensuous way.  Look how she slowly puts the hair back, kissing her neck.  They're really going at it.  Where's the guy, though?  He's in the corner.  Oh, the other girl's getting undressed.  Ben, if I have to look at your back, I'm going to shoot you in the head.  Ben, I will shoot you in the head.  There you go.  Whoa.  Oh, look.  There's barely anything there.  Look at that. 
[02:25:00]  There's a good scene going on.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy mother of God.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Even Steve's making the universal face of, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's good.  More clothing coming off.  More clothing.  Wow.  Yeah.  That girl's...  I hate to say this.  We're running out of time.  Is the guy almost ready?  Jesus.  Norton, are you insane?  But you've lost...  You see, you've lost your mind at the thought of the monkey.  One little quick dump. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  The monkey has made you lose your mind.  All right.  The girls are now on the floor.  Wow.  Let me...  Yeah.  I got to just...  Ben is completely in my way, and I'm going to shoot him in the head.  Whoa, man.  Okay.  That's good.  She's laying down on the floor, and the other girl is just going to town.  Anthony, Ben has handed me a note that this guy will miss the meet and greet if we don't 
[02:26:00]  do this in minutes.  Yeah.  Not with the monkey.  Are you almost ready?  Meet and greet.  Is the guy almost ready?  That's no pressure.  Look, I don't care if he's at quarterstaff, dude.  Yeah.  Monkey guy.  Monkey guy.  Get back.  Go back there.  Grab a razor blade and cut this guy's wrists because...  Wait, no.  All right.  Keep going.  Keep that scene going as monkey guy.  This is worse than a Fellini movie.  This is sick. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Look.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  I'm just going to concentrate on what the ladies are doing.  But somebody...  Steve, at some point, you're going to have to pan your camera over to videotape the monkey  action.  Hot monkey action.  Oh, boy.  No cursing.  No cursing.  Stop cursing.  Believe me, you don't even have to be completely ready.  I don't think the monkey will care.  The monkey's going to be insulted.  I can care less about the monkey. 
[02:27:00]  I wanted a cuter monkey.  This one's ugly.  All right.  Wow.  The girls are putting on one of the best shows ever.  Ever.  Cleansing the palate.  This is do or die.  Jim Norton's just sitting there eating a donut.  Jim's eating a donut.  There's a...  Check out the festivity.  There's a dead monkey in a bag ready to be ravaged.  Once again, just saying, screw the radio show.  I need to check this out for myself. 
[02:27:30]  Two girls.  Wow.  Is the guy ready?  Because this is it.  Hey, monkey guy.  At this point, whatever you got going, you know, you're going to have to do it.  So, monkey in the bag guy, go over there.  Yeah.  Wow.  And make sure, dude, of the utmost import, make sure none of that fluid, and I'm talking  about the monkeys, gets anywhere.  All right.  I don't need to see this.  For some reason, the guy decided to face my weapon.  Believe me. 
[02:28:00]  Just...  The monkey's going to spread rumors about you that you suck.  All right.  Rick is cutting the bag, Anthony.  Yeah.  And, Rick, make sure it's the...  Just make sure the face is exposed.  That cute monkey face.  Oh, my God.  This guy's going to do it.  This guy is going to do it.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Well, whatever you got to do, just do it.  That's all we got to say. 
[02:28:30]  And you got to do it for a little while.  He's grabbing the back of the monkey's head.  Look at it.  Norton, lift your shirt up.  We must confirm hot monkey action.  It's going on because...  Oh, my God.  He's doing it.  You can tell from the reaction over in the corner.  What?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  It's done.  He's done.  He did it. 
[02:29:00]  He did it.  Put that monkey back in that other bag.  All right.  Bag that monkey before you move it around again.  To hell with that.  Bring the monkey back to New York.  Oh, my God.  Rick's got a photo.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Rick's got a photo.  Hey, dude, hold the monkey up in front of me for one second.  You slut.  Yeah.  All right.  Faggot monkey.  Faggot monkey. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  Maybe it was a chick.  And the girls are still naked, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I mean, I didn't say anything else that I didn't have it back there or?  Dude.  No, those girls are done.  Yeah.  They're done.  All right.  Dude, whatever he's got to do now, make sure he gets off and does it.  What's your name, bro?  Mike.  Mike.  Mike from where?  From Jersey, dude.  Mike from Jersey won the Kid Rock Packet.  Yeah.  Mike.  But we've got to take care of the guy who brought the dead monkey in. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  We'll hook you up with something.  Just stay right there because Karen from WYSP will hook you up with a lot of great stuff.  There you go.  And I've got to say.  Ah.  God damn.  Let me see it, Rick.  Oh, I saw that one.  Rick, or Opie, officially, as far as I'm concerned, that just beat the crap out of anything Boston and  New York did, that beat Cancer Boob, that beat Guy with Spleen.  When you're talking, a guy getting treats from a dead monkey. 
[02:30:30]  What is it?  Oh, my God.  We've got some unbelievable pictures from FoundryMusic.com.  Oh, my God.  Steve, you've got video, right?  Steve, when will these pictures be up on the website?  In the next couple of days.  A couple of days.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, because, yeah, Steve's on the road with us, so you've got to go to FoundryMusic.com  to check out some of the crap we saw today.  Ladies?  Wow, ladies, beautiful.  Great job.  You've got to plug the website.  That was really hot.  How do I say it without... 
[02:31:00]  Oh, why is it a nasty little word?  Yeah, she got one of the nice...  Oh, let me see.  Come here.  Come here.  She's whispering to Anthony to see what we can say.  Okay.  The bad word is the F word.  The F word.  The F word.  So you've got to spell F-ing, but not F-ing.  You put in the U and all the other letters.  You know what I mean.  I know.  F-ing on film.com. 
[02:31:30]  So it's, you know, but there's an extra letter that you've got to put in there.  You understand what it is.  Anybody that doesn't, choke yourself.  Well, there's a big link on FoundryMusic.com as well.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  We want to thank the lovely gorgeous ladies for helping us out today.  What a show they put on.  Beautiful.  What a show.  All right.  And we're going to take a break and play What Do We Learn Next, I guess.  Hot monkey sex.  Oh, my God. 
[02:32:00]  We'll be back with What Do We Learn Next.  You guys are mean.  We've stopped and done delivery, my friend.  I don't have kids.  I want porno.  I don't want porno on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off because you have kids.  All you people with your children make me effing sick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're psyched.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The Opie, W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W. 
[02:32:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a scene.  What a scene.  What a scene today.  Philly gave us a show today, Anthony.  Oh, hell yeah.  I want to thank everyone in the Philly area for supporting the show.  Coming down to the station today.  The staff here at WYSP.  Another fun-filled history-making appearance.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable. 
[02:33:00]  I was looking at some of the pictures that Rick took.  And I'm horrified.  Yeah.  Horrified.  Yeah.  What's that guy going to say when he meets Kid Rock?  Hey, dude.  Dude, you know what I did to meet you, man?  You know what I did?  Oh, yeah?  Um, what?  And then he's going to tell him.  And Kid Rock is going to be like, what, cool?  I think he's going to be impressed.  Hey, cool.  He's going to be all right.  I don't think he'll take it literally.  Oh, yeah?  Well, where is she?  You know? 
[02:33:30]  Where's your little monkey?  No, it's not like a love name for my girlfriend.  It's a monkey.  He'll be into it.  Okay.  We've got to get off the air because we're going to go to the Kid Rock show tonight.  Oh, yeah.  At the Spectrum.  Kid Rock was supposed to hang with us today, but somebody asked us.  Something happened.  We will get to the bottom of it.  Remember, we always win in the end.  Always.  Always.  What a great day.  And then the show that the girls were putting on?  That was unbelievable.  Norton, how hot was that?  Right?  It was, it bothered me.  It was so. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  There was, there were really hot girls.  You know what I like about it, too?  It was easy.  There wasn't any begging, pleading.  And it wasn't like they start off and we had to go, could you please do a little more?  Wham, bam, right on the floor, going full out.  They're just cool.  I was talking to the girl on the thing and she's like, yeah, no, we get the site.  And there was no like, I don't want to take my top off.  She was, she does it on the site and she was doing it on the site.  It wasn't 20 plugs for a website and then you got a bag.  Those girls went right at it.  Beautiful.  Oh, I turned out the latest one, the girls from Curves. 
[02:34:30]  And none of them were bartenders.  And none of them were bartenders?  They were all dancers?  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Okay, I got you.  Truckingonfilm.com.  Yeah, but you got to spell out the F-ing word.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everybody knows that.  Yeah, yeah.  You could say truckingonfilm.com if it was a truck driving site.  Right, but it's an F-ing site.  Yeah, so you wouldn't say truckingonfilm.com.  That would be silly.  You'd say mm-ingonfilm.com.  Well, no M's.  Unless it starts the word monkey.  Monkey, F-ing.  Monkey.  Here's the deal.  We're done.  We're going to go to the Kid Rock show at the Spectrum, so we'll see a lot of people there. 
[02:35:00]  And then I think most of us are going to D.C. tonight, man.  We're doing the same thing tomorrow for a different prize.  You think D.C. could beat this today?  No.  I'm going to say no.  There is no way.  I brought dead Nixon.  Dead Richard Nixon in.  Come on, tricky dick.  Do it.  Do it.  There was a girl giving her a hummer outside while her baby was in a stroller, and a guy  put it in a monkey's mouth.  That's hard to beat.  I know.  Yeah.  Well, we'll have to wait and see what happens tomorrow in D.C. 
[02:35:30]  We got that trip to Hollywood to see the poison thing.  All right.  A few what-do-we-learns real fast.  Tom from Delaware.  I learned monkey see, Mike do.  The red pencil from New Jersey.  Today I learned I get to add necrophilia and bestiality to my list of terrible sins I've  heard on the O&A show.  Sheep lover.  I learned today D.C. can't top today's show.  See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, but suck it.  Suck it.  And a bride guy. 
[02:36:00]  I learned that eating a homeless guy's ass is too much for the radio, but skull effing  a dead monkey is okie dokie.  Gary from Philly, same thing.  A guy's D in dead monkey's mouth, always funny.  I gotta agree with him.  I was laughing my ass off.  Scott on line four.  I learned how AIDS started today.  Oh God, that's awful.  It was something very similar, I do believe. 
[02:36:30]  Norton wasn't at all.  Steve learned Jungle Love is not just a song by Steve Miller.  It's horrible.  And I guess we're done because it's tough to go to the phones here at this moment because  we gotta go.  Dead slut monkey.  All right.  I learned you may never get to F Pam Anderson, but if you F a dead monkey, you get to meet 
[02:37:00]  the man who does.  Ed from Philly.  Very good, Ed.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  Once again, I want to thank the listeners for supporting the ONA show here in Philly and  of course the whole staff at WYSP.  Yeah, bang up job, guys.  Bang up job and we'll see you guys in D.C. tomorrow afternoon.  Come on by the station and party like these guys did today, okay?  All right.  All right.  Peace. </pre>
