<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' usual nonsensical banter, prompting a suggested montage of their opening chatter.  They then transitioned to discussing their weekend, focusing on their television viewing, including shows like "Toddlers & Tiaras" and "Honey Boo Boo," specifically a scene featuring a toe infested with what Dr. Steve, a caller, later identified as likely subungual myiasis or chiggers.  This led to a discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories, which the hosts dismissed, followed by a discussion of unsolved mysteries such as the Costa Rican stone spheres, the Zodiac Killer, D.B. Cooper, and Amelia Earhart.  They also reacted to a video of the President being unexpectedly lifted by a pizza shop employee, and discussed internet trends like “horse manning.”  The upcoming Presidential election and swing states were briefly touched upon.  Animal attack videos, including a lion attacking a reporter and a hunter being killed by a lion, were discussed, interspersed with brief calls from Big E and Jimmy, a stand-up comedian facing jury duty.

The show continued with a bizarre advertisement for "Devil's Creek" in Edison, New Jersey, featuring James Norton recounting explicit childhood sexual experiences.  The hosts then discussed animals that can't right themselves, such as horseshoe crabs, prompting calls from Chris in Pennsylvania (explaining molting) and Tony in New York (mentioning a horseshoe crab restaurant).  Chris in New York also provided a detailed explanation of the medical uses of horseshoe crab blood. The conversation then shifted to a detailed recounting of a recent birthday party attended by several show personalities,  characterized by drunkenness, inappropriate behavior (including a guest crashing into a glass door and making lewd comments), and an early departure by some guests demanding cake before leaving.  This was followed by a discussion of a Twitter feud involving Troy Kwan's offensive remarks about a caller's child with Down syndrome, leading to a broader conversation about online insults and the show's own conflicts with listeners.  The segment concluded with a discussion of online avatars and the discrepancies between profile pictures and larger, revealing images.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on Opie's severe hay fever and resulting ear problems, including his allergist appointment (during which the allergist expressed familiarity with the show), his phone prescription for cortisone, and his search for a hypoallergenic dog breed.  The conversation also included a discussion of the New York Jets' use of two quarterbacks (Sanchez and Tebow) and fan reactions,  Time Warner Cable service issues, the Red Zone Channel, and a humorous segment mocking fantasy football. Opie detailed his frustrations with Twitter users, recounting instances of publicly shaming those who insulted him, often leading to account closures.  The show also included a critical review of *The Breakfast Club*, focusing on the awkward dancing scenes and the actors' performances, along with reflections on the characters and Molly Ringwald's career.  No specific in-studio guests were identified during this segment.


The show later delved into a heated argument between Erock and Troy, stemming from conflicting accounts of Sam's birthday party and accusations of lying and "bitchiness."  The discussion included nicknames ("the Chuckster," "the Oakster"), a detailed account of Troy's perceived "nagel move," and a grammatical analysis (with a lawyer's input) of Sam's statement about who he invited ("I only invited people I like").  The segment also included an anecdote about Kenny soiling his pants,  the upcoming 9/11 anniversary and the cost of the memorial, Led Zeppelin reunion rumors, a female referee's embarrassing moment, seeing Peyton Manning on a different team, and the hosts' technological mishaps.


Finally, the broadcast concluded with a discussion about potential show guests, including Brad Pitt (and the limitations of his fame in Armonk, NY), Justin Stangle, Jeffrey Toobin, Ann Coulter, and George Stephanopoulos.  This was followed by another detailed account of a party attended by one of the hosts, highlighting excessive drinking, humorous text messages, a guest's antics (running around in the rain, eating all the chicken fingers), and the fallout between one host's girlfriend and other guests.  Explicit language was used throughout, along with discussions of intoxication and other inappropriate behaviors. The show ended with speculation about the strained relationship between one of the hosts and another regular contributor, and confirmation of some guest bookings.

I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude. It's the Opie and Anthony  show. Strap in, dicks. This one's gonna hurt. Double guns, bitch. But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, noises. Ha, ha, noises. Ha, ha, noises. Ha, ha, noises.  Good morning, everybody.  Yeah.  Let's all come in and do it again. Do it again. Another week of radio. Ho-dee-ho-dee-ho. 
[00:05:30]  I'd like to be able to hear you, but I can't.  Oh, hop on. I'm suffering from hay fever.  Hey.  I'm a very allergic boy. I'm suffering from hay fever.  Hay fever.  It started last week.  And.  I took the elevator ride down to the ground floor.  Yeah.  And my ears, I'm underwater.  Still. Still. 
[00:06:00]  That's it.  That was about, I don't know, 40 minutes ago.  Whoa.  How do you make them pop?  I don't know. You gotta hold your nose and push out.  Boom.  I don't know.  Swallow real hard.  Boy, I felt a lot of air, but nothing.  Chew gum.  I don't know.  Chew gum?  I don't know.  Fears are clogged?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that gum.  I called my allergist and he goes, hey, you were talking about me.  And if you remember what I was talking about.  La Verace.  He pretty much says, hey, he's Jewish.  He sounds like he's clogged all the time. 
[00:06:30]  So I guess that's perfect for an allergist.  And if you remember what I was saying about this guy was, every time I go into his stupid  office, I never tell anyone, and I'm sure you do the same, what I do for a living.  Because we have cool jobs and that's all they want to talk about, which is nice.  But it's not nice when you go into a doctor's office and you want to try to get some shit  done.  No.  I just say, I'm in broadcasting.  Oh, I just say.  If they ask further, I just go, nah, it's just stuff behind.  No, I say marketing.  Really?  Yeah, marketing is like, what's that? 
[00:07:00]  But then they could ask you stuff and I'd be like, I don't know.  Yeah, I market things.  Like what?  Yeah, just these things.  Import, export.  Nah, just market things.  I work on like, you know, billboards and campaigns and stuff.  Yeah?  Yeah, I make it very vague.  I say telecommunications.  Huh?  I say I work for a telecommunications company.  I make it so vague within three questions that you don't give a fuck.  But I was stupid enough to tell this guy who I was.  Oh, I know why.  Because of my voice and stuff.  I want to make sure he took me seriously. 
[00:07:30]  So now when I go in his office and he's one of the biggest allergists in New York, all  he wants to do is talk about the show, even though he doesn't listen to the show, but he  knows that we have a pretty popular radio show.  And then like, I'm trying to figure out what I'm allergic to.  Like, and I did all those tests.  He goes, oh yeah, you're allergic to a bunch of things.  He's like, things.  Here's some things.  And then he's like, anyway.  And just wants to talk about the show.  And I'm like, no.  The reason I'm here.  I need to know what things.  Find out.  So I beat him up on the air, I think last week for not paying attention because he  wants to listen to the, you know, talk about the show, then what's going on with me. 
[00:08:00]  And I call him and he goes, hey, I heard you were talking about me.  I'm like, yeah, I was saying how you don't fucking take, take this thing seriously.  So then he gave me cortisone for allergies?  What's that about?  How does that work?  Because I'm out of my fucking mind, man.  Look at what cortisone is so weird.  It's like, it's delivered in many different ways.  Yeah, I got a pill for him.  Oh, a pill?  A cortisone pill?  Yeah.  There's injections, there's cream.  Yeah, because he heard how stuffy I was.  He did this over the phone. 
[00:08:30]  I'm like, I don't know if I should be prescribed cortisone over the phone.  Diagnosed over the phone.  And nasal sprays.  Damn.  You're in your cortisone.  I don't know, but I don't even know.  It makes you very, very, like, more, I should say, you're going to laugh when I say this,  but it makes you very irritable.  More than usual.  Irritable.  Like, I'm like, I'm not a roid rage.  Is that what it is?  Isn't it some kind of roid?  Yeah, I've been lifting my couch all weekend.  I'm still fucking clogged. 
[00:09:00]  And then I went down the elevator and I can't fucking hear now.  Man.  Because of my hay fever.  You keep doing the mouth open, like, yeah.  And you try to pop it to get the ear popped.  Yeah.  And you know, the term hay fever is stupid because you're not allergic to hay and you don't get  a fever.  What is that?  So why hay fever?  Why do they call it hay fever?  Hay fever means pollen, basically.  That the pollen count's a little high.  And it's affecting the opster.  Oh, boy.  The opster is very allergic. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, boy.  Because, oh, yeah, it's the height of the hay fever season.  Is it?  You don't get any of this shit.  Nah, I don't get those allergies.  I get this like three or four times a year where you feel like you almost feel like you  have the flu.  But you don't have a fever.  I get stuffed up sometimes if it's really bad.  Yeah?  You know.  Yeah, you kind of feel it.  You're lucky.  You're lucky because it's a pain in the ass, man.  What about animal dander?  Oh.  Does animal dander hurt?  Do you need to know?  I hate that word.  Cats and dogs, bad. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah?  Bad.  Really bad.  As in, I haven't touched a cat or animal in years.  Wow.  I can't even pet the fuckers.  Aw.  But then they got the hypoallergenic ones.  Yeah, those are the ugly animals.  They're not that ugly.  They can't have hair or something.  They're not that.  No, no, no.  They have human hair.  Yeah, they got like some kind of hair instead of fur.  Any dog that ends in poo is actually pretty good looking.  Uh, what about a shdoodle?  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Nah, the poos are better, I think.  Really?  Obama's dog is an allergenic dog.  Why?  Who's allergic in the family?  Uh, either him or Michelle.  Oh, boy.  But I know that that dog, I'm pretty sure, has hair and not fur.  Yeah.  Is that what you're going to have to get when your son asks for a dog and you can't say no?  Yeah, I'm going to have to get one of those.  It looks like a tiny little teddy bear and it can't defend himself type dogs.  Even though I want a dog dog.  He's going to be like, Daddy, can I have a dog?  You can't say no.  I want a dog! 
[00:11:00]  Not like this, like, looks like a stuffed animal walking on the sidewalk.  You don't like that?  You don't want to have a gremlin?  They're nice, but it's kind of embarrassing when you're walking around town.  You want to walk around with a man's dog.  They all got them little puny dogs in your neighborhood up there.  The old ladies with those little fucking dogs.  It's disgusting, actually.  Ugh, yeah.  They'd rather take care of their dogs than, you know, have a conversation with you.  People are weird in New York, man.  They hate people, but fucking will pretty much jump in front of a cab for their own dog. 
[00:11:30]  They're dumb little dogs.  Yeah.  So, I had to stay inside because the hot town was hot.  Did you need conditioned air?  I had to stay inside, indoors.  You hay fever.  Hay fever.  Because it's just having a massive attack.  I feel way better.  It's just the fucking ears are clogged.  So, say whatever you want about me.  I won't hear it.  You've got to blow those out.  I won't hear it today.  Are those the poo dogs?  Yeah.  See, how can you say they're horrible?  All right. 
[00:12:00]  I guess they've gotten better.  They're adorable.  No, you're not.  A bichon frisee?  You want a bichon?  They're very cute.  You just don't want a poodle.  You don't like them?  Poodles are assholes.  No, I like bigger dogs.  I like the one down bottom, the second one from the left.  That one?  Left, no.  That's a bulldog.  Oh, left?  That guy.  Oh, yeah.  That just looks like a baby husky.  Aw.  That's a hypoallergenic dog?  I could have that?  I guess.  That thing's adorable.  Angrydog.jpg.  Look how cute it is.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  That one.  That looks like a real dog. 
[00:12:30]  That's a pretty cool dog right there.  I like the furry little white one there, two over.  Look at him.  Yeah.  He would love to be petted.  Bichon.  You see a lot of those in New York.  They're cute.  Yeah.  Yeah, you scratch them under their chin.  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  Should I roll over and give you his belly-a-head?  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you get a hairless dog?  Ew.  Look at that thing.  You gotta have hair on a dog.  Do they?  Ew.  What is that monster?  It's a monster, and they just have horrible attitudes.  Monster.  Poodles are the worst.  Oh, go one down. 
[00:13:00]  Which one?  Oh, look at the little faces.  See?  The poos are good.  What is that?  I don't know.  That's cute.  No, that's something that just barks all day.  That's probably true.  Yeah, but look at the three of them over there to the left.  There you go.  More poos.  Little things are adorable.  Just put poo in his search.  I'd love to pet a small dog for a little while.  You would?  Yes.  For a little while.  For a little while.  You need to pet a small dog.  That's hilarious.  I'm lonely.  I have no pets.  No girlfriend. 
[00:13:30]  You got a cat.  Aw, Jimmy.  Cats are cool, but the shedding and stuff drives me nuts.  They're the same thing.  You do it with the fucking hair.  But you could throw a cat in your apartment for two weeks.  They wouldn't even notice you're gone.  They don't give a fuck.  They really don't.  And, you know, you could, like, have a relationship with a cat for ten years, and then one day  it'll just scratch your eyes out.  They're fucking lunatics.  They're complete lunatics.  Just fucking go after you.  You could get, like, you could get a wild German Shepherd, and if you're the owner for  ten years, you know nothing's going to happen. 
[00:14:00]  You're the honcho.  Right.  But with a cat that you never get past that fucking point.  You always have to be on guard with those assholes.  Cats are assholes.  Well, you had the coolest cat.  Yeah, we've talked about it.  That J.D. cat was almost human.  But the rest of them are fucking assholes.  I had two cats.  Serial animals.  Right to the end, they were just complete idiots.  Yeah.  You thought you made some kind of relationship with them.  One wrong move, and then they're scratching the shit out of you. 
[00:14:30]  You watched the Jets game.  I know you're not a big football fan.  You know what?  I turned it on for a few short minutes.  To see the wacky offense?  Yeah, just to check that out.  You know, that whole T-Bow thing.  And it was just like, ah, fuck this.  Oh, there's no T-Bow.  Give a shit.  I know, yeah.  Well, he's there in all the little sideline meetings.  Oh, I know.  He's all poking over.  What's going on?  Hey, what's going on over here?  He just trying to get his nose into everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, I should know what's happening just in case.  I think Sanchez showed everyone yesterday, even though the Bills aren't the best team in the league, obviously, 
[00:15:00]  that he's their quarterback.  Yeah, he to me.  He made it very obvious yesterday with T-Bow going, hey, what's going on?  Hey, what's over there you're talking about?  Hey, guys, can I sit down and listen?  Right.  He was following Sanchez like, no, man, we're the twin quarterbacks.  Oh, God.  Sanchez was just like, just fucking sit down.  And you know what?  And the fucking Jets fans booed T-Bow.  Yeah.  Because Sanchez was marching down the field, and all of a sudden they continued with that fucking wacky offense  because they wanted to see how it was going to work and brought T-Bow in. 
[00:15:30]  And like, no, man, Sanchez's got the fucking momentum right now.  Oh, believe me, the fans, though, the second fucking Sanchez collapses, they'll be chanting for T-Bow.  Well, Sanchez looked pretty damn good yesterday.  Yeah.  I mean, it's the Bills.  I'm sorry because we have a lot of fans up in West New York.  Oh, boy, did they fucking get wiped.  Bills aren't going to do much.  It was 48-28.  The game was pretty much over at halftime.  So, I don't know.  I mean, I don't, do you see the Jets using two quarterbacks like that the whole season, Travis? 
[00:16:00]  Well, like you said, this is one game.  Let's wait until, you know, they play some teams.  Some real teams, right?  Who's the first real team they get to play this season?  Well, next week, Pittsburgh.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's going to be a massive test.  Yeah.  That will be a big fucking test.  Pittsburgh's going to laugh at their wacky offense.  Yeah, but boy, they were quick to boo Tebow.  He didn't get that one yard.  No.  No.  Boo!  I think he had five rushes for nine yards. 
[00:16:30]  Five for 11, I think.  I don't think he threw a pass.  Nope.  And he handed the ball off three times.  Yep.  I think that's his stats, if I remember them correctly.  Sounds great.  He had a no game, but like you said, hey guys, what's going on over here?  Hey guys.  Hey.  I see you got your clipboard out.  What's on that?  That's what he, that's all I saw of him on the sideline.  Craning his neck to see.  Hey, let me in, guys.  The quarterbacks just looked exhausted running in and out of the game like that. 
[00:17:00]  They would do, I don't know if you saw it, Jimmy.  Sanchez would do one play, then he'd have to run off the field, then fucking Tebow would  come in, he would do a play, then Sanchez would run back on.  It was crazy.  Why were they doing that?  Especially in the beginning of the game, and then they settled down a little bit.  Settled down.  Do you think Tebow had to ask anybody, like after there was a group meeting, when they  walked by, what did they say?  What did they talk about?  What are they talking about over there?  Are they talking about me?  Did I come up?  Did I come up?  So, I don't know, that's a good start for the Jets, because they had a shitty preseason. 
[00:17:30]  It's always good when you get that first win, you know, then you don't have to worry about  not losing again.  Right.  Can't lose again.  Oh, and I had to watch, I like watching my football with the hay fever acting up.  I like watching the football.  I'm in my living room, and I'm getting ready to, like, a couple hours before, you know,  football, I'm just watching TV, and I just changed the channel.  That's all.  And it goes black.  Like, it'll pop on any second now. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  Two hours later, after I was yanking fucking receivers out of the wall, made the problem,  obviously, ten times worse.  Oh, no.  I have no TV in my living room, and I'm fucking watching football and golf in my bedroom  on a beautiful fucking fall day.  What happened?  I don't know, man.  Time Warner Cable.  You think it's Time Warner?  No, the other TVs were working.  Oh, it's just that one set.  It's probably your box.  You think it's the box?  Probably.  I've had to reset my box, like, five times this weekend. 
[00:18:30]  I reset my box.  Horrible service.  I think I'm finally going to go Fios.  Oh, you got it.  I think I'm finally done.  I don't think I've had to do that once.  No.  Like, you know that, that anthems, the brilliant impression?  Right.  I'll get, I've had that maybe once every three weeks or every month, I'll have that  for a half a second.  Like, that's how good the service is.  It's infuriating.  My Time Warner in the city, I haven't turned it on in I don't even know how long.  I slingbox my Fios from my house, and that's how I watch television. 
[00:19:00]  I don't even deal with fucking Time Warner anymore.  What happened with Time Warner?  They just saw all this technology, you know, catching up to them, and they went,  ah, we're the leaders, so we don't have to worry about that shit.  We'll just strong arm some of these buildings and tell them, ah, yeah.  That's pretty much what they do.  Yeah, yeah.  What they do is they get to the Supers.  Yeah.  The Supers have those little basements in the, ah, ah, ah, ah, offices in the basements,  and they go down there and make those fucking deals with cash.  I'm convinced of it.  There you go.  I think you're right.  I'm convinced of it, because why would you choose an old technology over a new technology? 
[00:19:30]  But that's what New York City buildings do.  That's exactly what they do.  So, our building, it took a long time to get it, and I kept asking, and the door guys,  and the desk guys would be weird about it.  They'd be like, yeah, we think it's coming.  It's almost like everybody gets a little piece of, of, I don't know what it was.  I think people finally probably asked where they had to rewire the building, because it's  a big building, but with a small building, what are the tenants going to do if there's  eight or twelve tenants?  Right, yeah.  How does the one guy decide? 
[00:20:00]  Shouldn't they have a vote?  Yeah.  No, they don't care.  Very strange.  Did you watch any Red Zone or anything?  How did your fantasy football team do?  What's going on?  Oh, well, my fantasy football.  They have the fantasy football stats in the paper today.  Did they?  I think this is the first year where I've actually seen it pretty much front and center.  It's right in the middle of the sports section.  All the players that did well for fantasy football teams.  People love their fantasy football. 
[00:20:30]  We should have done it as a goof.  I didn't do Red Zone.  Apparently, Red Zone had some problems, too, I guess.  What happened?  That's what I heard.  I wouldn't know.  I'm on Time Warner.  Ah, boy.  The Red Zone?  If you had it, there was no problem.  Only cable provider to not have Red Zone.  Oh, that's good.  If you have it, it wasn't a problem.  But if you all of a sudden decided, holy shit, I want that Red Zone, and you click to  subscribe, it would take upwards of 90 minutes for it to go through, because so many  people are trying to get it.  It is one of the best programs ever.  What's it do?  It's one of the best sports programs ever. 
[00:21:00]  It's literally just...  The Red Zone.  Just touchdown...  Anytime a team is in the Red Zone, which is the 20-yard line, they'll show that game.  And if no team is in the 20-yard line, then they'll just show a game.  Well, they'll show some highlights.  They'll show the featured games, which are the ones that most people around the country  would like to check out.  What if there's two...  They'll split screen, right?  Dude, you haven't seen...  Quad screen.  Oh, they'll just show you.  Oh, yeah.  They'll...  And the host of the show is ridiculous.  He's very good.  I can't imagine that guy is not the best fucking sportscaster in the history of the world. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, he can do two or three games in one time.  Oh, my God.  It's insane.  It's unbelievable how fast he is.  The guy is rattling off fucking everything.  If one team is in a huddle, they'll be like, all right, let's go to this game.  And then, you know, that play ends.  All right, let's go to this game.  I just picture him there smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee.  Holy shit!  If the offense is, you know, walking toward, you know, the scrimmage line, he goes, oh,  we got time, and we'll go to another game for two seconds.  Time, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  It's like an air traffic controller for football.  Yeah.  He does a great job. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know his name.  He should get some credit.  We did a bit one time for college football for The Tonight Show, and part of the bit was  having to call a game.  Like, you have to call a game live.  Oh, wow.  It's fucking hard.  Yeah.  It's really fucking hard to do this.  Because you keep trying to, hey, there he goes, and he's running.  Still, he cuts left.  It's so hard to keep that momentum the way a great announcer will do a momentum.  It's fucking impossible to do that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, it is a talent.  It was a lot easier.  I think you, like anything else, you figure out the rhythm eventually.  You know?  Because that's what they do.  Scott Hanson.  That's his name.  Scott Hanson?  Yeah, that's him.  It's my brother.  He's, uh, it's ridiculous.  Someone, uh, David Akers, uh, kicked a 63-yarder?  Yes.  Well, that's, that's tying the record again.  It's tying the record, yeah.  How many times did we tie the record?  I don't know.  Just pull it back a yard, for fuck's sake.  Get a new record.  Bounced off the, uh...  Did it really?  Off the crossbar at the bottom?  Yeah.  Oh, that's fucking cool. 
[00:23:00]  I would be the dick that, like, demands the NFL takes out a tape measure to see if it was  just over 63.  I want the record, motherfucker.  It was actually 63 yards and one inch.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, man.  Niners won, right?  Mm-hmm.  Wow, that's a fuck of a kick.  Oh!  Wait, was that the sound effect?  Do that again.  That could have bounced.  Do that again.  I put the audio out way too late.  San Francisco's side of the field.  God damn, it's a long kick. 
[00:23:30]  Drills it.  And it's off the crossbar.  Don't.  63 yards from David Akers.  That just made it.  That could have bounced off of it and gone the other way.  As this thing hit the crossbar.  God damn.  Bounced up in the air and went through the uprights to make it a nine-point game.  Because it hit the back of the crossbar.  A kick at 63 yards, you've got to have a low trajectory on it. 
[00:24:00]  That is a difference of three inches and it doesn't go in.  Yeah.  One more yard, it wouldn't have.  Not either.  It wouldn't even have come close.  An inch or two.  Three inches, it would have hit the front of the crossbar and bounced back onto the field.  And then he would have had to walk off the field.  Oh, well.  I almost made it.  Well, that was pretty close.  I feel good about myself, though.  Who else won yesterday?  Anyone care?  The fucking Eagles pulled that game out?  Redskins won.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Because Vic looked horrible at first, right? 
[00:24:30]  Vic for a four interception.  They beat the Browns, I think it was 17, 16?  16.  16.  What was it?  Something.  I don't know.  You got the sheet in front of you.  I do.  I was in the car over the weekend.  I was over the car over the weekend and had listened to the worst of.  And I was pleased that I was in there listening to Florentine going off about the goddamn fantasy football.  What a funny fucking segment, man.  Yeah.  He's just going off. 
[00:25:00]  Jim's so logical, too.  He has this really, he's a really hard guy to argue with because he has a great, because  if you get him on something, like, because, again, he was crucifying fantasy football.  I'm like, what about Zach Wild?  He's like, yeah, but come on, man.  He's a metal guy.  Yeah.  I don't know how he, oh, he avoids these landmines.  He lets them go off, but they never derail what he's trying to say.  I just like that, because Opie was saying, like, no, it makes Sundays a little more exciting.  It doesn't make it exciting.  What's exciting about that? 
[00:25:30]  There's nothing exciting about it.  Hey, look, David Akers.  Let's watch David Akers.  Oh, okay, I'm going to turn off the Dolphin game.  That's good.  You're not a good fan.  What's exciting about that?  It was so fucking good.  You know what's exciting?  Dropping loads.  That's what I want to hear about.  Did you drop a load?  No, it's watching the Chiefs.  It's fucking great, man.  It was really funny.  I love the people that can't laugh at themselves.  A few people tweeted, you know, the reason you guys don't like fantasy football is because 
[00:26:00]  you're so much older than the people that play it.  That's it.  That's the reason we should like it.  Yeah.  We're all pedos.  I know a lot of people in my age bracket that love their fantasy football, man.  My brother loves it.  Dude, there are people.  Who gives a fuck?  I know they enjoy it, but it's obviously one of those things that is easy to goof on.  So relax.  These no sense of humor motherfuckers.  I encountered probably the dumbest does not get it asshole on Twitter last night. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  I was watching the horrid Breakfast Club and Molly Ringwald.  Wait, why is it horrid?  Well, I'll get into that.  I just don't want to forget this.  Okay, go on.  And Molly Ringwald, it was like she was the cute girl back then.  I never saw it, by the way.  Exactly.  Well, I was just commenting.  Not on her.  I said, Molly Ringwald is like the Iraq War.  At the time, we were all yes, yes, yes, but now not so much. 
[00:27:00]  Like finding her attractive was like the Iraq War.  Not the Gulf War, the Iraq War.  And somebody actually said, you know, I wasn't for it from the beginning.  And starts getting into a war debate.  It's like, it was a dumb throwaway fucking Molly Ringwald joke.  Do you not get it?  Right.  And everybody just started going like, what the fuck?  You've got to put up with this all the time.  I said, yes.  Yes, I do.  You know what you've got to do, which is a lot of fun when it happens to me? 
[00:27:30]  I just tweet, hey, everyone, we got a dummy?  Oh, boy, people just enjoy that.  Because mine yesterday was simple.  Serena Williams won the U.S. Open.  So I just wrote, why else would I tweet this?  I wrote, congrats to Serena Williams for winning the men's 2012 U.S. Open.  Yeah.  That's the joke.  Sure.  People actually liked it.  They thought it was a good tweet.  One guy, she's a woman.  Oh, God.  And you just know they're not trying to fuck with your back.  Yeah, yeah.  So I just write, hey, everyone, it looks like we got ourselves a dummy. 
[00:28:00]  And then everyone just fucking piles on for the kill.  I just retweet sometimes with no comment, and they get killed.  Yeah.  It's great.  No, I love pointing out, hey, everyone, we got a dummy.  And don't try doing it, because for the most part, I know the difference.  I got two people to close their Twitter accounts last week.  Oh, that's great.  Just completely closed them.  One was some guy who got a snide comment about one of my tweets, and whether it was good  or bad or stupid. 
[00:28:30]  So I just checked his tweets, and so many of them was to girls saying how he'd like to  fucking lick their pussies, which is fine if you want to do that.  Sure.  But if you don't want to present yourself like that, you probably shouldn't.  And I guess he didn't, because I just screen capped a bunch of his tweets and posted it.  And within two hours, he had taken down his Twitter before the wife sees it, I guess.  And then another one was some woman giving me shit. 
[00:29:00]  And all I said was, your daughter has a big head, because she put her daughter in the  picture with her, in her profile pic.  Look.  Good.  You know.  Hey, that's what you get.  If you're going to put your kid in there.  So I said, your daughter has a big head.  And then, of course, the listeners start talking about her big head, and wiped, gone.  If you're going to just attack, if you're going to talk shit to people, don't put a picture  of your family up there, dummies.  No, no, no.  Do what the message board people do.  Hi, I'm HoneyLifton27. 
[00:29:30]  Who are you?  I'm HoneyLifton27.  The best is when you can go to it.  They use the same name for their Instagram as they do Twitter.  So you check that, and there's pictures of their wife, their kids, family, what they  do for a hobby, goofy friends.  And you just can read, you just keep posting shit, just ragging them about their family.  And they usually, yeah, just fucking destroy their account. 
[00:30:00]  Because they like to be, like a lot of the people on Twitter like to be, or these places  like to kind of make their opinion known, but with no commentary back.  Like, they never want to just say, hey, I'm so-and-so, and this is how I feel.  Yeah.  Which is why I just loathe them so much.  People are under the impression, too, that when I debate people with 140 characters, that  I'm just nasty and stuff.  No.  Most of my tweets, I'm just, I'm expressing my opinion, and I'm giving some fucking factual 
[00:30:30]  information that I've read, or just opinions.  And a lot of the times, I get shit like, you're a moron.  And it's like, oh, I'm a moron for not agreeing with you?  Oh, you don't agree with my point of view?  So I'm the moron, and you're the smart guy.  That's the dumbest thing anybody can fucking write.  Well, oh, so you must be right, and I'm wrong.  Bunch of douches.  Twitter is really a chore.  Yeah, what are we supposed to do with this Twitter thing?  I don't know. 
[00:31:00]  I don't understand the endgame anymore.  It's a weird point we're at with the Twitter.  I don't understand it.  I'll put it this way.  I read a tweet that annoyed me, but it was a retweet from somebody, and I forget what  it was.  But I went to the guy's timeline, and he just wrote a bunch of shit that I didn't agree  with.  But I realized that he's not following me, and I'm not following him.  It was a retweet, and I was going to say something, and I literally thought, you know  what?  None of my fucking business.  He wasn't talking to me.  Ah, there you go.  I don't follow him.  Wow.  He wasn't talking to me, and I really did think that, and I was like, why would I address 
[00:31:30]  him?  Yeah.  It's almost like, oh, it's a public forum.  It is a public forum, and no one says you don't have the right to do it, but it's this  fucking busybody, or as Anthony would say, this nosybody attitude.  Nosybody.  If somebody retweets what somebody says, you should address the person who retweeted  it, not the person who originally posted it, because unless you're following them, it's  none of your fucking business.  They weren't talking to you. 
[00:32:00]  I like that.  It does make sense.  And I practice that, too, because I really, I forget what it was, but it annoyed me so  much, and I'm like, no, shut the fuck up.  It's none of your business what he said.  That's literally like, it is a public forum, but it's like walking by a room where people  are talking, and they say there's a building full of rooms, and you belong to one room  with all the people you want to talk to and listen to, and you walk by another room, and  you're over here like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then you put your head  in and go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then you keep going.  Hey, get the fuck out.  You didn't want to be in this room until just now. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Or that's like you being in your room and someone coming from the other room and going, hey,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and instead of just addressing the person that repeated  it, you walk down the hall into the other room and go, well, he told me you said  this.  This is a silly job, though, a bunch of rooms, people yapping.  Yes, it is, but I wish I owned it.  No one interacts with each other.  If I knew, I would have bought the building.  You know how much money I'd be making from room rentals?  And what's wrong with blocking someone?  People get all, yeah.  Oh, I love the block.  I mean, social networking, we didn't really know what the fuck it was at first. 
[00:33:00]  No.  So you kind of, you know, you had to take a lot of shit when you blocked people at first.  Yeah.  But now it's very obvious.  You've made it obvious you don't like me.  Yeah.  And that is fine, by the way.  No surprise there.  Sure.  That is fine.  But I don't have to fuck in.  But why would I have to deal with that on a daily basis?  So I block you.  You have decided, I fucking hate your guts.  Okay, you made your opinion known.  Now it's go do something else.  Right.  And you blocking them doesn't affect that they can post at all. 
[00:33:30]  Of course not.  It doesn't affect anything about their lives.  But people feel like that, you know, we should be forced to read their negative shit on a daily basis.  That's just dumb.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  In the public eye, we know people are going to like us and people are going to not like us.  Period.  I'd rather deal with the people that like what I do.  I'd rather have people telling me, you have a fat wife.  You don't like your fat wife, Susan.  You screwed up my whole weekend.  Gary Sneaks. 
[00:34:00]  I couldn't stop.  I was just walking around my house going, it's titanium.  Yeah.  Like I just couldn't stop doing it.  Titanium.  And then I was trying to watch Apollo 13.  And all I was saying is, do they have that up there?  Well, I'm not going to use anything down here that they don't have up there.  You're ruining it.  How do we do so bad with the chicks?  Hey, people are yelling, hey, look at Fatso and Aidsie.  How come you married a girl with Aids and I have a fat Asian wife named Susan? 
[00:34:30]  I read her ad and it says, Susan, I thought she was American.  Fat Asian wife.  All I was thinking of was your goddamn Gary Sinise impression.  Which is right on.  Oh, it killed me.  It's very average, but I kept thinking of my fat wife, Susan, all weekend.  My fat wife, Susan.  He's just mad.  That's the best he could do.  Yeah, but they're both millionaires.  Forrest, we're both millionaires.  How come you're married to an Aids patient and I'm married to a fat Asian lady named Susan? 
[00:35:00]  Exactly.  What, did Susan win the lottery?  That hooker was right.  I am a freak and you are stupid.  Hey, before we get too far away from fantasy football, we got the fantasy football bit.  Oh, God.  We're not going to break.  We got to play it, though.  New to Sirius XM's fantasy football show, it's the Jim Florentine Show.  Putting the fun back in fantasy football.  Nothing exciting about fantasy football.  It's fucking guys in khakis and button downs watching football. 
[00:35:30]  They bring their laptops to a fucking sports bar to come over.  Who just scored that touchdown?  I go, why?  I got him on my team.  Fuck you.  Go in the ladies room and take a piss.  It's Jim Florentine and your calls.  Talking everything fantasy football.  Hey, Jim, what's the best way to keep up with your team while the game is on?  Nobody watches fucking football with a laptop open.  Nobody.  You have a fucking case of beer and some sandwiches and you're talking about fucking getting a handjob  from a stripper in the door of the commercials.  From the night before. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, man.  You know all your listeners love fantasy football?  All right, I don't give a shit.  No fucking manly men play fantasy football.  We aren't even sure why we hired him.  It seems counterproductive.  And we're going to open our fucking laptops and our iPads and we're going to have a draft.  Who are you going to take?  How about taking any ass, you fucking homos?  Or your fucking fantasy football?  It's just nerdness.  The Jim Florentine Show on Sirius XM's Fantasy Football Channel.  Go in the ladies room and take a piss. 
[00:36:30]  Good job with that.  Oh, uh, uh, when, when you mentioned, um, what I found awful about the Breakfast Club.  Oh, right.  So I was watching that earlier.  I mean, yesterday.  Earlier.  It was earlier.  Was it Judd Nelson's bad boy outfit?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, outfit?  It, I, my comment was, it's back to back douche chills.  There's no one moment that is like, oh, that was the one that made me go, uh, it's, it's, 
[00:37:00]  it's the whole fucking movie.  The only parts that aren't douchey are those occasional funny parts, you know?  Right.  Very rare, sprinkled through.  But the whole, oh man, the pain of, you know, uh, and their angry dancing segment.  And then Emilio Estevez dancing at first.  He's all angry and punching and walking upstairs and, and, uh.  You didn't like the dancing?  No.  It's embarrassing.  And Judd Nelson's so angry. 
[00:37:30]  Look, look, man, look how angry Judd Nelson is.  Oh.  Wait, go back so you can play this.  That's uncomfortable.  Oh, it's so uncomfortable.  I forgot this part.  And Emilio Estevez is not believable as the jock.  Oh, come on, man.  If you really want to break it down.  Although I thought he had the one good monologue in the entire thing.  Really?  Yeah.  He's good as a jock.  He calls him waistoid.  Oh, he said waistoid.  Hey.  Don't, don't light up in here, waistoid.  Oh, no.  Tell Sam to move that arrow before he's fired from his company.  Oh.  Why, why are they dancing? 
[00:38:00]  Why aren't you full screen?  Ah.  Why is there no supervision?  For these kids.  Look, he doesn't have a hint of a muscle on him.  Oh, he's the judge.  Oh, man.  Judd Nelson, he's just mad.  He's getting his anger out.  By dancing.  Anthony Michael Hall was just playing a dork, so him being uncomfortable is acceptable.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, this is so fucking douchey. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  Playing air guitar, is he now?  I feel like he must have been playing air guitar.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Why would Judd Nelson do that?  I don't know.  He's such a badass.  Why are they doing choreography?  Oh, he's got, I hate the bandana tied around his boot.  Oh, he's got the bandana tied around his boot, and he's just dancing like crazy.  Worst bad guy ever. 
[00:39:00]  Why is this in the movie?  I forgot about this scene.  I did, too.  It's so bad.  That's pretty much the dance montage.  And Molly was...  And then...  She was cute, though.  She had no tits.  That's all right.  That didn't matter back then.  I needed big tits when I was younger.  Really?  The bigger, the better.  Jesus.  I don't mind B-cups.  I think they're nice.  I said when I grew...  When I got older, I realized you don't need big monster tits, you idiot.  There's more to a woman.  She had nothing going on in front.  Yeah.  Then there was the Amelia West of his dancing scene, which was a douche chill. 
[00:39:30]  And then just, when they're talking, it's, you know, oh, when you get older, your heart  dies.  I don't want that to happen.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up, you whiny fucks.  Why was the movie so good, then?  I think it was good at the time.  83 or something?  Yeah, that's an old-ass fucking movie.  That is like...  That's about right, maybe.  It was like the coming-of-age movie.  Yes.  I hate coming-of-age movies. 
[00:40:00]  85?  I hate coming-of-age movies.  So that's, what, 27 years ago?  Hello.  Hello, everybody.  Yeah, Judd Nelson, I found, to not be believable.  Like, he was not a good...  I thought Amelia was good as a jock.  As a jock, really?  Because I thought the one monologue he had was at least good about the shame that that  kid must have felt telling his father.  I thought that was a good scene.  I laughed at that.  Did you?  Hilarious.  It was a good scene.  Tell his father that his asshole was taped shut by a woman.  His hair got ripped off. 
[00:40:30]  How embarrassing.  His hair got ripped out of his ass.  Well, the reason why the movie did so well is because everyone could, like, look at one  of the characters and go, oh, that's me.  I'm being represented.  That's me.  Which one did you think you are?  Everybody that thought they were Judd Nelson was Anthony Michael Hall.  Well, I wanted to be Emilio, but I was definitely Anthony or Michael Anthony Hall.  Anthony Michael Hall.  Anthony Michael Hall.  I was the fucking nerdy fucking idiot in school.  Abso-fucking-lutely. 
[00:41:00]  And it was probably fucking Judd.  Oh, man.  You were Judd.  You know what?  No, it was Ally Sheedy.  Just a dark, creepy girl.  That's me.  No, you were like a combination.  You could do combos, too.  You were a combo of Judd and Anthony Michael Hall, I would say.  Well, Judd Nelson wasn't that tough of a tough guy.  You saw it in the movie.  He really wasn't a tough guy.  When he was confronted, he backed right down.  I was a combo of Anthony Michael Hall and Emilio because I didn't play a lot of sports. 
[00:41:30]  What is your combo, Jim?  I was a combination.  I don't know if we can find a combo in this.  Yeah, you can.  I wanted to be Judd Nelson, but I was Anthony Michael Hall.  You were, too, right?  Yeah.  But I also kind of thought that I was dark and interesting, like Ally Sheedy.  And I would have fantasies about saying great monologues, like Emilio Estevez.  South Jersey Rick makes a great point.  Anthony was the janitor in the basement.  That's who I can relate to. 
[00:42:00]  The janitor.  Anthony was the kid whose asshole hair got ripped off in the story.  I can't believe I ripped your asshole hair out of me.  My fat wife Susan has no hair on her ass because she's Asian.  Lieutenant Dan.  Breakfast Club, Forrest.  Have some breakfast, stupid.  I don't like watching Breakfast Club.  I liked that 16 Candles when it first came out.  That's pretty boring, that fucking movie.  16 Candles?  Yeah, I always get these confused.  Really?  Which one's which?  And then you watch 16 Candles and realize it's fucking... 
[00:42:30]  But the donger made it fun, didn't he?  The who?  Yeah, I guess so.  I guess the movie doesn't hold up.  Eh, it's kind of fucking...  I don't know.  And then she has the birthday cake with the fucking stud at the end.  Does he just fuck the shit out of her and dump her?  Well, they don't show you that part.  You know he was trying to get his fingers smelly.  Oh, yeah.  Get a little on his finger.  But they gotta, you know, they gotta keep it nice.  It's Hollywood.  Yeah.  That's the only reason he went to that house with that dumb cake.  What year was that, like, that and Pretty in Pink? 
[00:43:00]  Molly Ringwald had Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, 16 Candles.  And those, you forget now, but they were all monster movies.  Dude, they were massive.  What else did she have?  Like, what was that, like, 80?  I'm gonna guess 84 to 87 or 88 or something.  And she played the exact same person, so...  Yeah.  In Pretty in Pink, she was the same chick, but she didn't have money.  But in Breakfast Club, she was the rich girl.  Right?  No, yeah, I think you're right, though.  What was the story of Pretty in Pink?  I forget.  She was trying to get the popular kid to like her, but she was from the other side of the 
[00:43:30]  tracks.  Isn't that the fucking...  That's every fucking movie.  No, because Breakfast Club, she had her choice of guys.  That was the conflict there.  Well, that was Breakfast Club, but it's the same movie as 16 Candles.  She's trying to get the popular guy.  Yeah, 16 Candles was 84.  Breakfast Club, 85.  Pretty in Pink, 86.  And was there anything, like, around 87 or 88?  That was the last of her.  That was the last of her, like...  How weird is your career where it's like, you got three movies in three years. 
[00:44:00]  You gotta think to yourself, oh, fuck, this is gonna last forever.  What was her next movie?  After Pretty in Pink?  Yeah.  A TV series called Tall Tales and Legends, and then a movie called PK and the Kid.  Oh, boy.  Kind of a drop-off.  That's a...  She did that series with Bill Burr.  Does anybody remember Bill and her?  Did the townies she was in.  Oh, no, I'm kidding.  That was probably after 2000, though, I think.  Jesus, Molly.  Yeah, Molly, what happened to you?  Jesus Christ, Molly.  What happened to you, Molly? 
[00:44:30]  Where are you?  Well, she got it back on track, right?  Fucking Illuminati.  Took her career away.  Yeah, probably because you put the fucking money in the bank, right, Molly?  Half squinting and psychotic.  He doesn't even realize she's left the room.  Crazy Bill is just yelling at the wall.  Fucking Bill is crazy.  Oh, then she went with the pickup bars.  That was supposed to be her big comeback movie a mere couple years later.  Oh, boy.  That fell flat.  All right, but she must have came back eventually.  Then what?  For Keeps.  Oh, boy. 
[00:45:00]  No, that didn't do well.  Oh, God.  It's her and who and a baby.  Yeah, that didn't do well.  That was 88.  Nothing from 88 is good to look back on.  No.  Keep going.  She had to have the comeback.  She didn't King Lear.  What's that one?  Fresh Horses.  Oh, boy.  No.  Wow, this is really not working out.  It's a Cincinnati college student breaks off his engagement to his wealthy fiancée.  After he falls in love with a backwoods Kentucky girl, he meets at a party.  Now, that's 1988.  She's probably 20 or whatever.  Never heard of that movie either.  No.  So you get three big hits, so they give you at least ten more movies to try to turn around again. 
[00:45:30]  What was the next one?  Women and Men's Stories of Seduction.  Seduction.  Oh, my God.  Made for TV.  No fucking idea.  What's the next one?  Strike It Rich.  Oh, my God.  What are you up to now?  Look at that cover.  90.  Oh, that's 90.  By 90, she's completely done.  Yeah.  Go back.  Let's see.  Where's the rest of her movies?  She doesn't look like that now, does she?  Betsy's Wedding.  That was with Alan Ald, I believe. 
[00:46:00]  Something to Live For.  Go to Betsy's Wedding.  Go to Betsy's Wedding.  Was Alan Ald in that one?  Is that the one?  Yeah, good call.  It is him.  Yeah, I think that was supposed to be her big comeback movie.  Yes.  And they dragged Alan Ald in there to help her out.  It was.  I don't think it did that well.  To my daughter, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And then Face the Music, Some Folks, what?  Call it a Sling Blade.  Call it a Sling Blade.  Oh.  Short.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she was in the short of Sling Blade.  That's right.  Is that really a...  I think she was the reporter, or the one that was writing the story. 
[00:46:30]  Could you click on that, Sam, before I touch you?  That was before the movie came out?  Yeah.  But who's playing him?  So, at that point, she's doing independent shit.  He's playing him.  Oh, wait.  Billy Bob and J.T. Walsh are in this?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the short that they actually finally made Sling Blade out of.  I've never seen this.  No, it's the beginning part.  It's only the part where they're in the hospital, and the girls come to talk to him and interview  him, and he tells the story about...  But you've got to remember, it was before we knew who Billy Bob was. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  We didn't know him yet.  No.  So, she was doing some independent shit to get her career back on track.  Yeah.  So, this is...  So, Sling Blade, do they...  She's not in the movie Sling Blade, right?  No.  Oh, okay.  No, they got some other shit.  Put it back, Sam.  Stop it.  And then, of course, wow, the next one is The Stand, where she was actually the love  interest of Gary Sinise.  Oh, I don't get it.  My fat wife's got red hair in her pussy. 
[00:47:30]  We were watching The Honey Motors, and someone said, get a load of Fatso, and she ran in the  room and said, who's talking to me?  Clarice, your wife has AIDS.  You really are stupid.  That hooker was right.  AIDS-y.  AIDS-y and Fatso.  Get a load of Fatso and AIDS-y.  See, we brought her right back around.  How amazing are we?  That's a full circle right there.  Exactly.  Townies was 96.  Townies.  Wow.  So, but she had those three in a row, man.  Unstoppable, some would say. 
[00:48:00]  Yep.  She was.  Three underscore days.  Horrible Twitter name, brother.  Horrible.  How are we going to remember that?  16 Candles has the best boobs on a boob double ever.  What scene?  Who showed the boobs in 16 Candles?  I don't recall.  Could you go to Mr. Skin or something like that?  And which one was Ducky in?  Ducky was pretty in pink.  Oh.  What did he go on to do?  What was that?  Nothing for literally 15 years, and then he got two and a half men. 
[00:48:30]  I don't know.  That looks like Molly Ringwald.  Oh, right.  But he literally was dead in the water.  I remember when me and Ann first started radio, he was wandering around the museum we were  broadcasting at.  Do you remember this?  Who?  The Ducky guy.  I don't know his real name.  John Cryer, right?  Yeah.  John Cryer showed up at the thing, even though he wasn't scheduled, hoping that someone would  interview him.  Someone would talk to him.  He had no career for well over a decade, and now he's one of the highest paid fucking  sitcom stars.  He had a couple of really lousy pilots and stuff. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  Unbelievable.  I swear to God, Caroline Mufford had to flunk about nine grades.  Truly makes me ill.  She's perfect.  That's all right, man.  What?  I don't remember that from 16 Candles.  Do you?  No.  Oh, what am I, a homo?  Oh.  I like that noise.  Oh.  Wait, John Cryer.  Oh, is Two and a Half Men coming back with Kutcher? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, they're doing okay.  Okay.  You know, not as good as when Charlie was there, but enough to keep the show going.  Oh, I got eggs instead of tuna, so I got to eat them before they get cold and rubbery.  Nothing worse than fucking cold eggs.  I'll tell you what's worse.  Having to leave today at eight to do fucking jury duty.  Oh, Jimmy.  I can't do it.  I'm fucking, I'm doing red-eyed tonight.  I can't do it.  No.  Well.  I'm not giving up a fucking TV appearance.  Of course not.  Of course not.  No, you're not going to be there all day.  But you have to, I have to write.  I mean, I'm.  Oh, I see what you're saying. 
[00:50:00]  I get the topics.  You have to write.  You can't just walk in cold.  Oh, I know.  You can't just act like a lunatic.  They're on to all that shit.  Oh, well.  You got to be a little more clever down there these days.  Yeah.  I don't know what you could do.  Maybe you want some suggestions how to get out of jury duty?  We could do that next.  If you tell them you're on this show, there's a good chance that they will not take you.  That usually helps.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If they're a fan or not a fan, you're usually out.  That's what happened to me.  They knew what the show was.  There's enough shit to Google.  Yeah, I mean, one of the guys was a listener.  Right. 
[00:50:30]  Like one of the lawyers, one of the attorneys.  Right.  How long were you there for?  I got there probably around eight, and I was out by noon.  All right.  I can handle that.  See, the problem is you're going to have to sit in the big room.  You can't even plead your case.  You go up to the big desk, and they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because everyone has a story.  Yeah.  So you have to just fucking sit there for a while.  Did you see the video about jury duty that they play?  No, they didn't give us a video.  Oh, man.  It was great.  Really?  It might be worse in the city, too.  I don't know.  So bad.  Because mine was in Westchester.  Yeah, I'm hoping I can talk to somebody, because not only am I on this radio program, 
[00:51:00]  every day, and am I doing Red Eye tonight, but I'm leaving Thursday to do Irvine, and  it's like, if I get put on something, what, am I going to cancel a gig?  Of course, I can't do that.  You should bring in one of those daddies.  Oh, TS?  Yeah.  Bring in one of the, you know, train.  Oh, this is right.  With my lady friend.  My lady friend, Gil.  Right.  Gil.  Well, should we break so we can eat some eggs and shit?  Yeah, let's do that.  Yes, please.  We should do a montage of the first things we say when these mics go on. 
[00:51:30]  We should do a montage of the first things of the first thing when these mics go on.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  Because even after all these years, it's just dumb little noises.  Ha ha, noises!  Make sure all the tones are there

[00:59:00]  though it's the same fucking scenario every time every single time uh and then uh seinfeld i'll  always still i'll always put seinfeld on i just can't stop i'm addicted to it uh it's crazy that's  true history channel yeah history channel uh has a lot of uh good show i've noticed the history  channel though really steering clear history i it's like they they're doing some kind of ufo shit  this weekend like uh yeah uh ancient astronauts that last thing ancient astronauts nice yeah so i was 
[00:59:30]  watching i like the history channel anything on there i don't know they kind of rotate the the the  amount of shows that i watch it's uh but but i always come back to the same like shows every every  day you just look for something else there's nothing there i'm pissed off at that uh me tv  because they took canon off at 11 o'clock in the morning i usually would go home and take my little 
[01:00:00]  nap before uh the trainer comes over and i'd watch canon canon a quid martin production they took that  off so now i'm all angry they put on stupid fucking rockford files oh god i know oh my god jesus christ  jesus christ i like shows about unsolved mysteries you know there's a bunch of big huge  rock balls in the middle of a forest somewhere and they don't know how those were made either  yeah yeah i know i'm being vague but i'm gonna now look it up i heard some crazy shit huh i heard 
[01:00:30]  some crazy shit on that ancient alien thing uh yesterday and it was really ridiculous they're  talking about these you think that's bullshit these weapons that were um uh in russia and then  they sank into the fucking ground and yeah and it's leaving radiation and i don't know i'm not buying  any of that shit there'd be something uh there'd be something i'm trying to find this thing and 
[01:01:00]  that fucking because 9-11's tomorrow you know so uh so uh there was a lot of 9-11 specials on and  there's this fact or fiction thing and i had that on for one minute and i wanted to shoot my television  why because one of those fucking loose change cocksuckers oh really was yapping and they had  uh demolition experts come in and destroy a building and show how it's done with the explosives and the  prep work that it takes to uh have a controlled demolition of a building is insane it's insane the 
[01:01:30]  prep work sometimes and they were saying uh something uh the skyscraper could take four months  of just prep work before they're ready to bring it down and these motherfuckers were saying well  of course they're saying that uh a lot of the these demolition crews do work for the government so  like they're in on it it's just like they're in on it and then the other thing they were saying was  well that's the old technology because they said they would they destroy the building and then the 
[01:02:00]  demolition guys are walking around the site going there is so much evidence that this was a controlled  demolition he goes look this cord like the primer cord stuff laying all over pieces of the um the uh  shit that they used to fasten the explosives the i-beams that have been cut with these shape charges  all this evidence that you could tell it was demolished by explosives by a professional company  and then the the dumb loose change people well they're using newer technology it's top secret 
[01:02:30]  technology that destroyed that building it's not the consumer level that they're using so they explain  it by saying there's a secret way to do it a newest bestest secret way that's like getting it's like  getting mad at 13 year old because they all are like little baby boys and baby girls who are mad at  mommy yes you can't i've i've stopped even getting mad at them because they're so valueless in their  opinions i was i i couldn't help but get angry because i'm just like the the proof is right there 
[01:03:00]  there's so much there's no evidence to support their side except for their dumb fucking worthless uh  bullshit i understand why jfk conspiracy conspiracy theorists think that like i don't think that  they're morons for thinking it could be a conspiracy right i get it yeah but it's on 9-11 anyone that  thinks it was a conspiracy that involved the government and or the or the controlled demolition  you're just a dumb motherfucker like you're dumb many fucking people would have had to be  you're an idiot they don't believe the planes actually hit the buildings so what are all those 
[01:03:30]  people that's another thing oh they got off in fucking uh cleveland but then what hit the buildings  that everyone saw government made playing it's like little children it's like a game of dungeons  and dragons it's like you just make things up things up it's like iraq's fan fiction right it's just  made up yeah well the ultimate warrior and the hulk were in the plane yeah right right well we all  know the hulk was responsible i've seen videos of hulk peeking out behind the building i did this  where are you going i did this for you i did this for you 
[01:04:00]  fucking hilarious oh gosh oh when's a new iphone out soon right uh yeah another week or so i think  yeah they announced it on wednesday oh it hasn't been you can't even pre-order it yet no no there's  uh someone's got to find this website i was at and it's all these like mysteries that are unsolved  and um there's a bunch of big fucking rock balls perfect balls in the forest somewhere that i want 
[01:04:30]  to bring to your attention and i can't find balls i can't find the site it's driving me nuts  and then it's all those uh another one is the lights out there uh i think it might be arizona  that just hover yeah hover above the ground and they they still don't know what the fuck that is  scary they're acknowledging it's something but they can't figure out exactly this theories on what  it is anyway when i take my motor home trip uh next summer out to the desert uh i'm gonna check  all that shit you should check that out i'm going to roswell bitches but really yeah i'm just gonna go 
[01:05:00]  out west but roswell there's nothing there i don't care i'm gonna fucking a balloon fell there  once they built a whole shit town around it that's right here where the alien heads were no they  weren't a balloon fell it did but you'll be in the desert i don't care i like that i like i like  driving through the desert yeah it's cool i only did it a couple times but i thought it was stone  balls of costa rica yeah holy shit so yeah it's got stone balls and they don't know why these 
[01:05:30]  fucking balls are in the middle of the woods in costa rica and who built them and all that shit  and i never heard of the the balls that costa rica how big are they some are really big  and some are uh like bowling balls and stuff yeah but they get really big as well  like why look look at that one that one's got to be uh seven foot high seven to eight foot high  and it's perfectly round no one knows where they came from no not just laying around the 
[01:06:00]  fucking forest of costa rica crazy that's what i'm getting at what is the theory on that look at it  just a bunch of bulls rock balls and they don't they can't really figure out how they would have been  able to engineer those really yeah because they're perfect how old are they about 10 20 years  i think from the 70s i don't know stones are believed to have been carved between 200 bc and  1500 a.d how the fuck do you do that but with primitive tools aunt well you know i'll just say 
[01:06:30]  how do you do that you know but they don't have any idea by the way i think we had some shit on  this planet and something massive happened you think yeah yeah i think some shit was here before us man  you see how time is looked at we're not sure the date somewhere between 200 bc and 1500 they get  like a 1700 year window yeah but that's exactly what we were talking about yeah is that bad no but 
[01:07:00]  it's kind of the way you look at time like yeah it was anywhere between you never hear it was either  between 230 bc and 227 b and that's completely acceptable yeah that's how many generations would  have to live in that time period where they're like no it's in that period yeah 17 or 18  what else do we know about the balls of costa rica nothing not much no the balls of costa rica  i wish i fucking could find this goddamn link i'm on so many fucking things on my phone i don't 
[01:07:30]  i was flipboarding that and i don't i don't know where the fuck it was but there was other ones that  were pretty cool too they had the zodiac killer that was that's another mystery obviously never  solved mystery they had the db uh cooper thing yes they had the hovering lights they keep thinking  they're getting close to db cooper too amelia earhart's another one that they think they're  getting close to there's an expedition out now they there's a famous photo of what they think is her  airplane wheel with the undercarriage yeah sticking up was taken on a ship for years ago they were 
[01:08:00]  saying that uh what they believe happened now with amelia earhart is uh she landed her her uh out  of fuel plane um or like malfunctioning plane on an island landed on the beach um whether it was a  nice soft landing or a busted up the machine a little bit uh still to be determined and then um  the uh water just pulled the plane into the ocean wow that was it and they found like some of the 
[01:08:30]  plane parts in the water so what happened to her they found some kind of freckle cream uh a bottle  or something yeah that she used to use freckle cream yeah she hated her freckles oh so she covered  that she covered her freckles really and they found that so she was a ginger oh yeah yeah she was quite  the ginge her and her guy probably the guy they the um yeah she was with a co-pilot kind of guy i heard  she got a really bad case of poison but she just never got over really yeah as they were in the jungle 
[01:09:00]  looking for bananas to eat she wiped her hiney with it yeah wiped her hiney with it she never recovered  so they think they probably lived out their lives on the lives on this island just never found yeah  never found if they lived if they lived at all do they wander around the island to see if you can  live out your life on the island there's nothing much on that island it's not how you're living out  your life i think you're just dying of starvation their life was a week but they romanticized and  says probably they lived out their life here but when they have more signs of what she was doing 
[01:09:30]  on the island maybe the weather will blow it out yeah that's some harsh fucking weather out there i  bet yeah i betcha it didn't affect the balls of costa rica no oh dr steve only has a few minutes  dr steve hey boys how are you sir sorry i'm late uh we have uh we have uh the honey boo boo  we got the mom i don't know her name the mom on that show she has a forklift toe meaning she had 
[01:10:00]  a forklift run over her toe and the toe is pretty much dead or really fucked up they uh they showed  the toe on honey boo boo the other night where she took off her sock that she wears constantly  and uh the toe was pretty fucked up and there were a lot of bugs around it bugs now would the bugs  appear immediately when she took the sock off or are these bugs living in the wound well they may be  living in the wound how the fuck you get rid of that well first you have to seek medical care 
[01:10:30]  and you have to have good hygiene good hygiene she uh she may have a thing called subungual myiasis  which is a great thing to google uh image on and uh that's where uh you have damaged tissue  under the toenail and uh flies like the smell of dead tissue so they get in there and they lay eggs  and then you get maggots under the toenail uh these were like uh very tiny they call them gnats on the 
[01:11:00]  show but i don't know the other thing that's common to to uh lay eggs under the toenail or uh chiggers  oh boy oh jesus christ dr steve come on now love the chigger the uh i think the uh the scientific  name for chigger is tunga penetrans oh that's my science will penetrate the skin or uh tissue under 
[01:11:30]  the toenail and they'll grow so they'll you know they'll lay their eggs and they'll grow under there  and they'll crawl around and they'll um they'll separate the toenail from the toe so there's space  in there for stuff to get in how do you sleep at night with this all this racket under your toenail  knowing there's chiggers under your toenail how does that how do you doze off yeah yeah so what  they would normally do is remove the toenail and clean out all the dead skin and stuff and then 
[01:12:00]  the problem solved but right sounds like she's not seeking appropriate medical care well she's a  big tv star now so she probably should right oh and such a uh a good representative uh of the  of southern culture jeez yes it's all look like you know what you know what i can't stand when i see  a nice girl with a chigger on her arm oh boy you know it's just on her oh gross disgusting yeah if  you ask me such a fucking asshole oh jeez my kids to school but uh hey lucky you 
[01:12:30]  if you want to make bobby puke the next time uh google oral my eyes that's where uh people have  such bad dental care that they have maggots growing and living in their mouth what where is this  it's m-y-i-a-s-i-s yeah we have it let's follow let's look it up sam on youtube or videos 
[01:13:00]  should we do videos yeah i can't watch this kind of shit  we're looking at a pink napkin or whatever with bugs on it or something  why does it have bugs on it because they just took it out of someone's fucking mouth  why do they have bugs on this thing abscess and these are all the flesh-eating balls  they're pulling the bugs out and putting it on the paper  they like the petrifying gang in the split  how the fuck do you get bugs in your gums you know how bad her breath must be oh my god

[01:14:00]  you know crawling around inside your mouth  why is this guy's elbow breathing  oh fuck i can't even look at that  what is a moving wound  this has 12 million views  what is a moving wound  well a moving wound may have a bot fly larva under it  bot flies  how do you get to the point where you got a huge  how big was that that was like a pancake sized wound  on his elbow and it's breathing  yeah  by the way in this thing where they show you other videos

[01:17:30]  the biggest pizza  carlo owner  I've ever seen man  you have no idea  look at this guy  everybody look at these guns  he's putting on his guns  his big arms  he's in good shape  now he's doing the  joshing around  shaking hands  he hugs him  and now he picks Obama  off  look at this  just picking up the president  giving him that bear hug  where he lift him off the feet  man are you a power lifter  or what  I don't know  they have to be  lift your skinny ass  good to see you 
[01:18:00]  this guy just loved  touching the president  you see the end of that  he was going to go  for the ball thing  where he just tapped the ball  that looks so silly  that's how the guy is  he's just like that  I want to pick Sam up  let Josh pick you up  I don't want Josh  to pick me up  Josh  I don't want anything  to do with Josh  Josh  Obama's really skinny  huh  yeah  he kind of has  that like Chris Rock body 
[01:18:30]  yeah  yeah  man he's just  fuck it  that's the  by the way  that's the best  meeting the president  video ever  no one who's ever  met a president  on video  has a better  president meeting  video than that  you think that picture  will be in his pizza shop  forever  him lifting up the president  and fucking  the girl freezing up  taking the picture  yeah  I would risk getting fired  in front of everybody  I would just ask him  for a picture  because they're probably  like don't ask for pictures  but I would just do it  it's like who cares  if you get fired  from the pizza joint 
[01:19:00]  oh you would  you would definitely ask  yeah  ah  joshing around  hey  oh  and now is that  going to be like  the new thing now  to pick up the president  I hope so  they're all going to bash  people in the head  for trying it  yeah  it'll be what  secret service  tankly wanted to  pick up fucking Lennon  I mean  Reagan  oh boy  they'll turn this  into something  because it's like  everyone was T-bowing  planking  yeah  what was the horse  the horse so on 
[01:19:30]  getting fucked to death  by it  getting fucked by  yeah  horses  what was it called  horse  I don't know  horse play  where you make believe  your fucking head  is off your body  ah that's  the horse thing  yeah  from that movie thing  but they had a name  for it  ah  and then they  then they did  of course  East Wooding  where you take  a picture of yourself  with an empty chair  ah  that's funny  headless horseman  nah  they called it  something else  oh I thought  it was headless horseman  that's what Edgar  Head is saying 
[01:20:00]  horse  they had  they had a  they had a cutesy  name for it  for the fucking  internet  horse  put a horse  in there  horse  ah whatever  maybe it is  just a headless horseman  maybe that guy  is right  I think it is  I took a picture  of myself  fat susaning  it's where you stand  next to somebody  with a big fat head  it's all that's  your fat wife  it's your titanium leg  your titanium leg  stupid  your titanium  you use it on  the space shuttle  your space shuttle  hey  dumbbell and legos  you're going out  with A.D. and fat soul 
[01:20:30]  I love it  yeah  what a fucking  dumbass movie  that was too  you don't have  the name  that you came up with  yeah  just saying  the headless horseman  headless horseman  is that what it's called  so yeah  they'll try to figure out  how to capitalize  on you know  bear hugging  the president  yeah  what a set of bulls  to do that  I mean you know  so the president  got a little bump  from the DNC  I guess so 
[01:21:00]  he's up  4% I think  yeah  4 points  5 points  somewhere around there  it's going to be  very close I think though  yeah that'll come back  down earth a little bit  it's all the  swing states  that's all that matters  you mean the only states  that actually think  right  the only states  that actually  weigh  and people go  no here's why  it's a swing state  shut up  if you don't know  what they're going to be  if they have to campaign  harder in those states  because those states  are unpredictable  then those are smart states 
[01:21:30]  and the rest of us  are fucking dummies  we're dumb in New York  New York  dummies  always goes  Democrat  yeah  and it's ridiculous  you're going to leave your house  for a wasted vote  no because I'm also  going to vote for  other peoples  that have a real chance  yeah  you know  my local elections  what I mean by that  is Mitt Romney  has no fucking chance  in New York State  not  well yeah  not a chance  not even  he won't even campaign  you're right  you know what  it is kind of a wasted vote  when you think 
[01:22:00]  people say voting  for a third party  is a wasted vote  but I mean  why is voting for Romney  in New York  not a wasted vote  it is  you're right  it's a wasted fucking vote  I think if you vote  it's not a waste  I'm going to vote this year  I haven't voted  since Ross Perot  I'm voting this year  but also  you know  you're voting in  some congressmen  senators  things like that  you've got to  make sure  you pick those motherfuckers  is Chuckie Shue  up for a re-election  Chuck Schumer  yuck  I just like his niece  you do know  they're related right 
[01:22:30]  yeah  aw  I had no idea  yeah  the Amy Shumes  and the Chuck Schumes  yeah  they're related  close  cousin I think  or an niece  but I mean close  related  whether they're close  or not  is different  oh yeah  blood wise  they're close  he probably watches  around Comedy Central  and cringes  oh god  I hope people  don't link her to us  don't make the connection  oh god  look what she's talking about  ah that's great  all that harsh stuff  good  Chuckie Shue  yeah  the shoemaker  yeah 
[01:23:00]  we'll see what happens  but what is it down to  like Florida  Michigan  Ohio  Pennsylvania  Pennsylvania  possibly  right  not so much though  Ohio's a big one  I know that  Ohio  so goes Ohio  and what  Wisconsin I think  maybe is one of those  swing states  I don't know  what are some of those  swing states  I'm gonna be super  packing over to a swing state  and then we're gonna see  if the GOP  come out right  at least we're done  with the pep rallies  I want a picture of Obama  he seems fun to meet 
[01:23:30]  he seems like a nice man  nice  you think  yeah I do  I think so too  yeah  has nothing to do  with his policies  I think as a human being  he comes across  as a nice guy  yeah  a bit nerdy  like we've said  a million times  oh yeah  a bit nerdy  but yeah  Nevada  Colorado  Iowa  Wisconsin  Michigan  Ohio  West Virginia  North Carolina  New Hampshire  or is that Vermont  Florida  which one is that  which triangle is that  up there  on the top 
[01:24:00]  that's New Hamster  oh it's New Hamster  yeah  is a swing state  I guess they're  gonna be campaigning  in Nevada  which  is  rocking with about  14% unemployment  that's good right  yeah  yeah  it's great  but isn't that  isn't a big part  of Nevada  being  having high unemployment  because the casinos  are so big  that a lot of people  are not vacationing  there anymore  oh  I'm guessing 
[01:24:30]  because that's like  luxury money  to go on a trip  to Vegas  and a lot of people  just don't  although I am  working Vegas  coming up  we had to look  for airfare  that'll help  it's expensive  I'm hoping to bring  the economy back  oh  but it's fucking  maybe if you cut  maybe these scumbag  airlines cut down  the airfare  people would go there  yeah maybe  yeah something else  would be done  with that  it's getting  just stupid  but that's where  these motherfuckers  are going to be  going to be campaigning  that's for sure  by the way  going backwards  for the people  that do care  because it drives  them nuts  it was called  horse 
[01:25:00]  manning  horse manning  look up horse  manning on the internet  that's ridiculous  like you hide  you hide your head  but the rest of your  body's showing  and then Jimmy's  head pops up  somewhere else  and looks like  your head is off  your body  that doesn't make  sense  why it was  horse manning  it was a big  fucking deal  on the internet  but they called it  horse manning  let's see a picture  Sam stop playing  around the website  oh that's pretty funny  see it looks like  you're holding  your own head  on the picnic table  alright there's a girl 
[01:25:30]  laying back on the picnic table  you cannot see her head  and there's another girl  hiding behind the picnic table  which appears to be her head  I've seen a lot of  al-qaeda videos like this  two feet away  they're hilarious  a lot of horse manning  going on  one guy  in Afghanistan  one guy  some people try to get  creative with their  horse manning  let's horse man  Sam  I want a horse man  with you  let's Josh around  and horse man  don't touch me  let's horse man  see this guy  look  the body's over there  with no head  and then this guy's  putting the head  in a bucket  this was really huge 
[01:26:00]  is that a photoshop  or is that just  no it's two people  this was huge  on the internet  for maybe  I don't know  eight days  it's pretty clever  though  god damn it  but everyone had  a horse manning  picture on their  Facebook page  if you're hanging  with the hip crowd  you've got a horse man  you've got to be  part of the hip crowd  you need a friend  you can't horse  horse man alone  see we should have  done some horse manning  pictures  guys let's horse man  let's put our faces  by each other's  penis  horse cock manning  oh radio guys  were doing it  fuck that 
[01:26:30]  that's wacky  so now we're not  doing it  that's wacky  fuck that  pretty zany  I was looking at a  site yesterday  that had a bunch  of those pictures  that were just  taken but look  like other things  like it looks like  the girls tits  are hanging out  but it's somebody's  elbow  there's a whole  bunch of those  yeah there's a  fuckload of them  it's pretty cool  they're really funny  and then the other  thing yesterday  that I was totally  digging on on  Twitter was  it's like about  a ten minute clip  of a bull 
[01:27:00]  in Mexico I guess  or maybe Spain  I don't know  just railing the  shit out of people  just fucking  running through  the streets  and flinging  people through  the air  that's sort of  like running  on the bulls  but they do it  a little differently  down there  don't they have  a rope on the bull  they have a rope  on them  and if he gets  a little too  rambunctious  I guess they  pull them away  that's great  yeah that's great  fuck shitty cultures  why do we have  to be assholes  as humans  but somebody  said boy the bulls  are getting better  at flinging humans  right  they've just about 
[01:27:30]  had it  the people  are trying to  run  the bull  comes in  on them  full speed  puts that  head down  and then  quickly flips  its head up  people go  fucking flying  it's hilarious  love when  people get hurt  by animals  love it  agreed  but the animals  are stupid  because they  can't figure out  anything  after all these  years you'd think  they would figure  out something  fuck  it's always just  about brute force  isn't it  they just love it  what happens  somebody's just  twittered  somebody pretty 
[01:28:00]  even though  I butchered  a joke  I said that  this guy  had the best  Obama  the best  president  meeting video  ever  and then  somebody  twittered  John Henkley  had a better  meeting video  which I think  is very funny  mr. president  there's a few  that might be  a little better  pleased to meet  you  well I got to 
[01:28:30]  see that video  now  yeah it's a pretty  good one  is it pretty  bloody  pretty violent  no  not really bloody  the animal  yeah I always  feel bad for  the animal  that's terrible  in those  situations  especially  right  yeah but  at least  they don't  have swords  in them  at that  point  you know  I don't  know what  happens to  the thing  at the end  I'm sure  they kill  it  yeah of  course  but it  is fucking  up a shitload  of people  and it's  pretty god damn  fun to watch  love those  any animal 
[01:29:00]  attack videos  are great  god you just  watch them all  like fucking  when is it  coming  when is it  there it  is  you fucking  idiot  what's in  their DNA  they can't  figure shit  out  that really  just bothers  me  they don't  have the  divine spark  that god  put into us  yeah why do  humans just  I mean even  god touch  you ever see  the painting  where god  touches the  guy's finger  and a little  spark  that gave  us all  that  that's  gotta make  you think  about some  things though  no  yeah sometimes 
[01:29:30]  because you  mush down  an animal  and you  mush down  a human  there's  very similar  shit in  there  oh boy  I know  right  they're just  they're just  jostling around  is it a lion  oh it's a lion  oh this lion  is not gonna be  fun  lion attack  he's in a cage  with a trainer  too  oh boy  is he trying  to reason  to go back  let's see what  happened  what did you do  you missed the  attack  sam  he's just playing  he's playing  he's getting 
[01:30:00]  he's scared  he's freaking  strong  what would  you do  if one of  those  panicked  like he  is  there's  nothing  you  could  do  he's trying  to scratch  its belly  what has  got it  it's got a  hold of the  reporters  like  it's biting  his leg  oh man  it's getting  his leg  he's basically  eating that guy  right now  it's biting  his leg  it's holding 
[01:30:30]  on to him  oh man  but it's not  a violent  attack  and the  trainer  slow  oh no  oh man  oh my god  it goes up  near his neck  how'd you  miss this  it's jumping  up on him  and the  trainer is  fucking  wrestling it  off  that guy's  got to be  on complete  panic  fuck yeah  can I leave  the cage  right now  you can leave  the cage  the guy's  now  oh he's  like  open that  fucking  door  fuck that 
[01:31:00]  he's got a  lion bite  but I'll say  the lion  that was  amazing  fucking  shit  falling out  of his  pant leg  he has a  scratch on  his calf  but it  locked  it put  its teeth  on  it wasn't  like a  violent  if the  lion  wanted to  kill him  it could've  but the  lion  put its  teeth  around  its  calf  literally  if that  thing had  sunk down  it would've  ripped its  calf off  he didn't 
[01:31:30]  rip any  flush  he was  just  playing  that  fucking  was the  lion  playing  yeah  and the  trainer  he's like  swatting with the  trainer now  the trainer's just  not scared of him  how do we survive  in the woods with  lions  oh that's the  earlier part of the  clip where he gets  a little  rambunctious  with them  yeah  who does  the guy  or the lion  the lion  gets rambunctious  with the reporter  see he  there's something  about that  reporter  that lion  just wants to  fuck with him  oh man  yeah but the lion  you think he's  fucking with him  or trying to  kill him  no he's just 
[01:32:00]  fucking with him  if he was trying  to kill him  he'd grab his  throat and just  fucking kill him  it's funny when an  animal attacks  and the trainer  just ignores  stop  release  release  and the lion  just continues  eating  like oh yeah  that's right  this could have  happened at any  time  how did we get  the upper hand  on animals  because there's a  time we were all  living together  outside and how  the fuck did we  figure that out  the second we  decided to pick  a rock up and  throw it  that started a  whole ball rolling  up to what we  have now  nuclear weapons 
[01:32:30]  our intelligence  that's why we  got it because  there's no  natural enemies  that's why we  have fucking  cancer and  AIDS and all  that shit  because there's  nothing else that  will kill us  like no predator  yeah you gotta  figure the first  like guy that  picked up a rock  and threw it  and then his  neighbor picked  up a rock  and he's like  fuck man this  guy throws a rock  further than me  and it's like  how could I  fucking fling it  further than him  and then he  starts thinking  and then you  kind of you  grab like a  vine and go  if I swing it  around now and  throw it like  that I could  throw it further  and that guy's 
[01:33:00]  like fuck man  that guy throws  a rock but  now I gotta  get a fucking  maybe if I  sharpen the rock  but let me  break it down  when you pick  up a rock  day one  how many days  had it go by  where people saw  rocks and said  oh pretty stupid  people though back  then how  embarrassed  figure out how  to pick up a  rock no  how embarrassed  was everybody  who didn't  pick one up  like the one  guy throws the  rock and the  other people are  squatting and  holding it in  front of them  hiding behind it  they're like  why didn't we  think of that  that's such a  smart thing to do  like they pick up  a rock in their  bare hand and 
[01:33:30]  just sit behind it  hoping to go  oh one guy  throws it  that's what I  can't wrap my  head around  yeah  eventually they  had to like  figure out that  they could pick  up a rock  yeah  something as  simple as  throw it  just go hey  if I fucking  throw this thing  or a stick  or like  hey that guy  was bugging me  I picked up a  rock and throw  it it hit him  yeah  and now he's  not bugging me  anymore  right  he's laying on  the ground  bleeding  I would have  loved to go  back in time  and just watch  these idiots  sitting around  with rocks all  around them  and not being 
[01:34:00]  able to figure  it out  finally figure it  out  yeah  so strange  and then when  you really look  at the time  period and you  look at like  nuclear weapons  and space travel  and shit  it's like wow  fucking all came  from some guy  picking up a rock  right  more importantly  it just comes  from the ground  in the end  everything  which is so weird  everything  as long as you  just dig it up  you mix it  you heat it  you cool it  you stretch it  and then  you make a spaceship  right  out of just dirt  and fucking 
[01:34:30]  water  fucking heat  thus then  yeah  there's not really  pollution  no everything  is what it is  it's all part of  the planet  there you go  it's not like  we're getting shit  from out of space  and bringing it back  and making shit out of it  that would be  true pollution  yeah that's  moon rocks  are true pollution  right  everything else though  it's like hey  I want to make an airplane  here's some dirt  here's some trees  yeah  and some water  you make a fucking 
[01:35:00]  flying machine out of it  it's insane  I was reading  more about the Voyager  that shit is just  fucked up  yeah  finally leaving  our solar system  tumbling through space  in between stars  what's in between stars  nothing  the great void  but what is that  just space  there's like  but what do  what do they mean  by nothing  in between stars  just space  they're actually finding 
[01:35:30]  what are those  little molecules  that they're saying  everything reacts  off of  there is something  we just don't know  what it is  it's like  we don't know  what 90%  of the dark matter  is  we don't know  what it is  we don't know  what most of the  there's certain things  like with  universes  where the amount  of stars  should not be  keeping all the  external stars  in the gravitational  pull  those things  should be flying off  in a lot of cases  and they're not  so they don't know  they have no idea  what is  they're trying to  figure it out 
[01:36:00]  what's in an empty space  yeah  we just don't know shit  it's gotta be something  we know a small percentage  that's it  but they think  there's something  that everything  is reacting off of  like there's one  god  well that's what  they think  they've found  the god particle  they think  they have  they think  they have found  that  finally  yeah I don't know  Higgs and Bowes  what?  I think it's called  Higgs and Bowes  oh  again  I'm probably  saying that wrong  but  yeah yeah  I saw that trending  Big E wants in badly 
[01:36:30]  a guy named  Big E wants in badly  what's up Big E  what's up Big E  what's up  Bobo and Anthony A  just to let you know  in the Bible  God takes man's domain  off of animals  and the animals go crazy  on men in Revelation  check that out  why?  it's a  I'd rather read a  Stephen King book  so what happens  the animals  the animals are gonna  get us in the end?  and nah  you know  you take it out  for a minute  they just want  to curse on men  the animals go crazy 
[01:37:00]  birds and shit  start attacking men  and all kind of  stuff like that  sounds like a  Harry Potter  normal  that's where they get  that's where they get  the birds and stuff  Hitchcock and all that  that's where they come for  what?  they're attacking humans  for what reason now?  if God takes  man's domain  men have domain  over all  animals  and God takes  man's domain  off of animals  and they attack 
[01:37:30]  humans  oh shit  so  drug deal?  drug deal?  yeah  drug deal  yeah  you wanna hear?  fucking goes there  Biggie where you calling from?

[01:42:00]  on him  because it's got  the momentum  I think I might have  seen this  it's charging  right at the hunter  he gets the shot  off  and I think  the lion was  kind of in the air  and lands right  on top of him  the guy's freaking  out and realizes  holy fuck  he's dead  let's see  I think this is  the one  what's it called  the lion has  crossed over  their own tracks  I say the line  there Carl  they have become  the hunted  there's a few  guys standing 
[01:42:30]  around  yeah yeah  and they're all  whispering now  they're in the  they're in the  bushes there  this lion  he's gassing  so what is he doing  the lion's actually  hunting them now  fuck that  what the fuck  do you do  shoot him  I guess that's  what they do  now they're doing  like the  Elmer Fudd walk  they're looking around  alright they're  kind of running  a little bit here  limbs and the  animals disappear  behind cover 
[01:43:00]  they give chase  alright they're  giving chase  but the wounded  animal doesn't  present a shot  oh man  alright so they're  chasing the thing  there he is  they can't really  get a shot off  no  no  so they're  chasing after  this wounded  lion  no the video I  saw is short  it's only like  less than a minute  and it's not  really quality  it's not good  quality  no it's not a  really quality  video  well you should  have used a  GoPro 
[01:43:30]  the fuck  we gotta play  this out  this thing's  gonna charge  maybe it's the  longer version of  the video you  saw  maybe  that's  I mean  most people would  tap out of this  video you gotta make  these things short  yeah  it gets you  it gets you  and I'm gonna  wait  hold on  we're committing  to this video  unfortunately  okay now they're  in shooting position  they're all pointing  in an area  jeez they got like 
[01:44:00]  five rifles on  this poor  fucking thing  this might be it  oh  fuck  holy shit  huge lion  the thing is  just  committed to  fucking take  out this  guy  mouth  open  that line  is dead  instantly 
[01:44:30]  and then the  lion goes  crashing into  the hunter  that just  shot him  that's like a  lord of the  rings  fucking  type of thing  right there  holy fuck  put this on our  facebook page  opian anthony  one word  please  holy fuck  that's insane  i think it's  the longer  version of  the video  carl  yeah  damn  you would bet  a lot of  money that  fucking hunter  is fucked  and who got  the shot in  he did  oh he did  yeah  where did he  hit him  right in the  brain  oh i guess  so  yeah  wow 
[01:45:00]  and then the  thing you can  tell is instantly  dead as it's  in the air  and then it  crashes into  the guy  thank you carl  alright man  take it easy  we'll put that  on the facebook  page opian anthony  check that one out  she did the  line  fuck that  got a shut off  you can't  still slides right  in it  i saw you  this visual shit  is great on the  radio  what what am i  yeah sorry  what can i say  everyone's got a  computer we talked  about it we told  you where you  could find it and  see it  so deal 
[01:45:30]  i think you gotta  work on your  imagination  right  so when i used  to hear this shit  on the radio  you start imagining  your imagination  use your own  imagination which  makes it even  better  it's bigger than  your imagination  that's right  you can't hunt  huh  i'm not a  hunter no  i don't like  hunting i don't  mind it i don't  care if anybody  else wants to do  it but uh  yeah i like i like  all animals i like  animals alive i uh  when i lived in  western new york they  were always you know  hunting deer all the 
[01:46:00]  time yeah i just  and was invited a  million times just  couldn't fucking do  it i don't mind  that and if i had to  like hunt for food  i'll kill a  motherfucker in a  second oh sure  i'll fucking gut  him with my  teeth but uh  you know i could  just go and get a  steak at the store  what about the  what about the  hunters that uh  you know the big  fat fuckers that  go in like a  fenced-in area  what big game  hunting things like  that  fenced-in area  reserve or  yeah i don't give a  shit i don't care  i don't care you're  good with hunting  across the board  whatever yeah i 
[01:46:30]  don't i don't care  it's just not my  cup o tea as they  say i uh i get  that weird dark  feeling after you  kill something you  just kind of feel  like it wasn't  bothering anyone  now it's just it  was living and now  it's not and it's  all because it was  here and now it's  gone because of me  yeah i don't mind  bugs i'll crush a bug  like a motherfucker  it depends on the  bug dangerous  encounter with a  buffalo bunch of  kids uh being  charged well they  keep a safe distance 
[01:47:00]  the west yellowstone  chamber of commerce  condemned the video  saying the people are  very lucky they  didn't get hurt  silly that crazy  it's a wild animal  you should really  look out for bison  yeah and everything  else  elk and i want to  go to great adventure  i went to the wild  park and uh... one  of the monkeys broke  my antenna  aww  that's a great  adventure  and uh... one of the  monkeys on your car  was very rambunctious  why was your toyota  celica near a monkey 
[01:47:30]  why were you driving  a toyota  because they said  they're just having  a good time over  there  my cv joints  oh shut up  what were they  fucking with the  bison at what  yellowstone  yeah  see bison out  there  little bison  so they just  they knew they  could get a cool  video  yeah i guess so  they're fucking  with it  i remember we had  the bison video  on our show  i think it was in  a parking lot  came out of nowhere  really  that's one you  should look up  online  that's a that's  a good one  bison in a parking 
[01:48:00]  lot  bison seems like  they should be  extinct  yeah they'll have  that look don't  they well they  almost were  bison definitely  has that look  almost like a  woolly mammoth  yeah yeah  yeah like it  it should have been  condensed down to  something else by  now  we're so used to  seeing alligators  of course they  probably should be  extinct but you  know it's out  we just know it  but you don't see  bison really a lot  bison  unless you live out  that you know  out west  yeah this one  charges some woman  in the parking lot 
[01:48:30]  no this isn't the  one  it has 35 views  and we talked  about the video  years ago so i  would imagine it  has more than 35  views  well maybe that's  just a copy  a repost  yeah it could be  a repost  check out the  youtube video  lion eats man  we're done  we saw that  because now it  is too visual  yeah you stupid  idiot  a little visual  is okay  a lot of visual  then i agree  with that guy  with that idiot  that idiot  yes  why don't we  take a break  and get into 
[01:49:00]  some other shit  next stay there  tired of those  all-inclusive  vacation packages  to overcrowded  caribbean beaches  the hottest vacation  spot is practically  in your own backyard  visit devil's creek  in the heart of  downtown edison  new jersey  here's the founder  of the devil's creek  tourism board  james norton  who's going to  share with you  some of his fond  memories of this  beautiful vacation  destination  i have a really  weird vague  memory of my  pants around my  ankles on the  steps in this  apartment building  there's an older  boy um an older 
[01:49:30]  boy who used to  make me suck his  penis he's gotta  be older i think  he tried to fuck  me in the butt  once but it  didn't work  first you'll fly  into picturesque  newark new jersey  then you'll whisk  away southbound on  the scenic new jersey  turnpike to  beautiful edison  township where  you'll be a hop  skip and a jump  away from devil's  creek where your  fantasies become  a reality  there was these  twins i would get  both of them at  different times to  sit on my face  because they used  to pee their  pants so i liked  that smell yeah  and that would  make them sit on  my face behind the  bushes so i could  smell i remember  my one friend i was 
[01:50:00]  sucking his penis and  we got caught by  another friend he's  the same one that  fucking crazy same  one that urinated in  my mouth for  memories that'll last  a lifetime even the  suppressed ones come  visit us at devil's  creek i don't think i  got erection to that  age i can remember my  friend's penis getting  erect and me wondering  why that happened with  his penis like i  didn't know what that  was it was in your  mouth jesus christ  the hoover kid  devil's creek if you  don't leave crying we're  not trying hard enough  i know we're gonna move 
[01:50:30]  on because that's what we  do oh but uh brad buckwalter  on twitter he goes uh some  animals have figured out  how to stay around for  150 million years like the  dumb horseshoe crabs yeah  that's another one where  you're like that all about  why are you still around  does nothing just just looks 
[01:51:00]  weird sitting on the beach  those things are prehistoric  they really are prehistoric  and you know most of them  are on their back so how did  they survive yeah they're  easily killed they roll over  and they're done but they've  been able to fucking figure  out 150 million years  doesn't make any sense i think  if you've been around 150  million years you should be  able to get off your back  yeah yeah you know what i  mean yeah you turn over and  you're dead doesn't seem like  something that would be a  prerequisite to being around 
[01:51:30]  this as long as they have  all right people are saying  we're doing pot talk monday so  let's go with this for a  second how many other  animals can't get off their  back oh dogs can get off  their back horses can get  off their back well you got  your tortoise every time  maybe they can swing it  occasionally but i think if  you put a tortoise on its  back it's fucked all right a  tortoise and a turtle put them  in that category horseshoe crab  and then what else that's pretty 
[01:52:00]  much it yeah horseshoe crabs  there's no way in hell you got  that giant round body and  those tiny little legs that  can't even reach out over the  edge to do anything like a  turtle if something's close  they might be able to use  what's around them turtles do  that thing like they're on  their back they take their  arm and then they take their  head and stretch it out too  yeah they like to use the  top of their head yeah push  themselves over they got some  moves horseshoe crab with  those tiny little under  underdeveloped legs underneath  and they're real close to the  middle of this thing they're  not even at the edge where 
[01:52:30]  maybe they could grab  something it's so fucked  could they use that stupid  fucking oh that thing that  looks like a stinger but it's  worthless for defense yeah  oh yeah what if they take  that and knock it up can  maybe they can't can they  well then it folds in a bad  area where you need some  support there the whole  fucking horseshoe crab folds  oh yeah they got that foldy  part to that little hinge  there's no way they should have  been around as long as I  think should have been dead  long time ago millennium ago 
[01:53:00]  uh let me say hi to uh jp in  manhattan jp  what's up boys what's  doing hey man  the narwhal or the narwhal  depending on where you're  from yeah it's a cross  between like a unicorn and a  whale and it shouldn't be  alive and it scares me  what yeah that is a weird  one that's that whale with  the big fucking horn oh  yeah why is that still  around oh yeah and they  they pop out of the the the  ocean on the blacks just in  case geez and they sword  fight what is that big 
[01:53:30]  twisty fucking horns how  do they survive all these  years with that dumb thing  getting in the way that is  something that should not be  on any animal in the year  2012 no what is it made of  is it like nail material I  don't know all that shit's  like nail material it's not  ivory is it something like  that or oh I bet it's not  another one is coming in and  he's not here to defend  himself but it is pretty  funny Scott in Jersey Scott  what's up boys hey hey  yeah the other thing that  can't get up back is James  Norton at training club oh 
[01:54:00]  now he's not even here here  all right but we still love  him uh he's on the end  train going down a jury duty  ah he should they should call  in yeah I want to see how it  goes for him down there let's  say hi to Joey on Long Island  Joey hey what's up boys hey  man Beatles are fucked once  they're on their back they're  done I can't turn over really I  never I never noticed that I  never noticed a bunch of dead  beetles on their back beetles  are fucked up not dead  beetles live beetles once 
[01:54:30]  they're getting ready to die  they lay on their back and  they're done just step on  them and that's the end of  it well bugs always die on  their back I don't know it's  kind of weird what is that  every time you see a dead  bug they're on their back a  lot of animals die on their  back because I think that's  just a comfortable position to  be in hey there's Sway  I like it's right this way's  we're on the run I guess he's  late late for a show  he's a big TV star doing the  fucking VH1 music movie music  awards oh yeah huh MTV MTV I 
[01:55:00]  said VH1 same thing I think  right at this point let's say  hi to Chris in Pennsylvania  Chris hey guys um horseshoe  crabs molt so 99% of those  shells you find on the beach  are empty there's nothing in  them I've seen some with some  shit in it I've seen live ones  yeah come on we lived on the  north shore of Long Island I've  seen a lot of horseshoe crabs  in my day stinger moving  around yeah they just should  not be around what stupid  wave knocks them on their  back and they're dead yeah 
[01:55:30]  that's dumb dumb looking that  thing how stupid that is and  is it a bug is it part of the  bug family no that's some kind  of fucking what is it is it a  crustacean yeah but you can't  eat it look they're useless they  have tiny little legs they fucking  go on their back they die and  then there's no meat for anyone  to eat there's nothing on that  thing they don't contribute shit  to the planet it's got spikes  everywhere yeah wow that's like a  shoulder pad of some kind of uh 
[01:56:00]  of Viking and then the shell  itself is so it's like paper thin  yeah it's all thin so they can't  even survive the heel of your foot  I remember throwing a rock through  one of those once when I was a kid  like just just some yellow shit  oozed out was it alive yeah that  goes against your whole fucking  hunting thing and killing no I well  you had to learn that killing was  bad and made you feel bad by  killing things right remember I told  that story when I rolled that  fucking the the tuna can lid right 
[01:56:30]  that was all gnarly and sharp yeah and  I rolled it like a wheel over the top  of a newt Jesus and I cut him in half  and it went you heard it make a noise  yes wait what's a newt again it's  like a little um mousy lizard lizard  thing it's it's actually an amphibian  yeah it's an amphibian I found him in  like the one of the little lakes  around Long Island but that's how  serial killers start yeah they do it  and they feel good well I did it I 
[01:57:00]  felt bad you just see there's the  difference when you do it and feel  good you become a serial killer when  you do it and feel bad you become a  human being you didn't get that  adrenaline rush like no oh I gotta do  this again like the big fucking rod  you come in your pants for the first  time after you cut something in half  imagine that you feel so good that you  did it that you're like I gotta do that  again I do it like sex it's like you  have sex and you're like oh that was  great right imagine killing something  and getting that feeling yeah then you 
[01:57:30]  gotta just go out and do it again I  gotta start collecting trophies yeah I  was just like uh wow that I don't  like that at all I don't like the way  that felt I hunted rabbits in um in  California hunted a little rabbit you  shoot them in the noggin and then you  fucking skin them and gut them and then  you put them on the fire and you  barbecue them I uh I ate rabbit rabbit I  liked rabbit yeah tastes like chicken  it kind of does taste like chicken  tastes like chicken not a lot of meat on  those damn legs though no no let's say  hi to Chris in New York Chris good 
[01:58:00]  morning boys good morning Chris hey you  know we're in the middle of a phone  topic  regular radio would be proud of us  phone topic you guys gotta do a phone  topic every day  every day something preferably topical  but if you can't go topical you could  go lifestyle lifestyle something that's  just gonna get those phones lit you  just want to get those phones lit you  want to you want them to react what  you're doing on the show  oh god sitting in a fucking meeting with  a PD is he's telling you this shit 
[01:58:30]  that's what you're gonna want to do  you want to engage the listener in  conversation and yeah and it's a  remember the pyramid one oh what was  the pyramid one again you start with the  you start with a topic yeah then you go  with the your thoughts on it right  there's the pyramid of okay and then  you go with the expert yeah that will  give you more knowledge on the subject at  hand and then finish it up with listener 
[01:59:00]  phone calls listener calls yes first you  bring it up then you get talk to an  expert no you're talking about amongst  yourselves yeah you know about this  dumb thing oh by the way here's the  fucking expert on the thing says this  or do you do the listener calls before  the expert no I think you do the expert  first and then wrap it up and then let  the callers run with it and then run  with it oh yeah because they would  probably ask questions of the expert of  course right regular radio or  satellite radio why satellite radio does  the phone topic thing yes who Roberts 
[01:59:30]  does all the dumb mashup does guess what  uh is in my pants mm-hmm they go great  they will that's everything here is get  the phones going get the phones going you  realize morning mashup has eight people  right now oh man and they get they talk  two and a half minutes an hour me and it's  just us they do phone topics like once an  hour really like what kind of time  they'll go like uh oh you know uh when  Nicole was getting married it would be  like my bridesmaid wants to change her 
[02:00:00]  dress you ever have a situation where  you have to tell a friend something that  you don't really want to tell oh oh and  then people call in they go oh yeah my  friend oh really how'd that work out  find out what their phone topics are  today and we're just gonna steal we're  gonna do the exact same phone topic and  i don't care how douchey they are yeah  yeah yeah we're gonna challenge  ourselves today yeah let's see if we  could pull this off some morning  mashup phone topics let's say that a 
[02:00:30]  chris in new york chris yes gentlemen  hey buddy hey well to be a somewhat  expert you know i uh the horseshoe crabs  they they do provide something for us  back in the 1920s it was discovered  that their blood would coagulate if it  was introduced into a specimen that  contained endotoxins endotoxins are a  byproduct of bacteria when it dies off 
[02:01:00]  the bacteria cells break up and they  release a chemical that is called an  endotoxin and that's how you get a  fever chills and you feel really crummy  when you're sick now dialysis patients  can't have any endotoxins in their  water because it will make them very  very sick so two crabs do play an  important role in our lives within this  planet the more you know holy shit i  yeah i felt like i was back at school  you're not gonna fucking give a pop quiz 
[02:01:30]  are you i hope not something about an  endotoxin and then what's the um the  horseshoe crab coagulates yeah the what  the endotoxin the the endotoxins cause  the blood that's drawn from the  horseshoe crab to coagulate so if you  put in some water and then you mix it in  with it and then you let it sit for a  specific time yeah and then if it  coagulates if it turns into like a a 
[02:02:00]  goober then you know that you've got  and oh it's just a test i know what  this guy's doing he's talking down to  us right now yes what what grade do you  teach i could hear it in your voice  no i'm not talking to you guys down to  you guys and i don't teach actually you  don't what about a beginning otoxin  too with some at the beginning of it  horseshoe crabs also serve a role in  anti-cancer treatment and why are they on  their backs on the local beaches 
[02:02:30]  terrible well wouldn't the cancer uh you  know researchers be fucking gathering  that shit up think you'd see a bunch of  people with bandanas on their head just  collecting fucking horseshoe crabs we're  having a horseshoe crab drive today tell  the asians while they're getting their  stupid clams and mussels to pick up a  few horseshoe crabs yeah the cancer  people well that's a local joke because  the asians love digging up their own  fucking clams they don't they take them  to the restaurants they work at they  don't give a fuck they don't they don't  give a fuck that it's been told that  those waters might be polluted hasn't 
[02:03:00]  been uh given the old stamp of approval i  don't know what that's about all right  there chris thank you hey you're welcome  have a great day and finally i didn't  realize we were going to learn about  horseshoe crabs but one more tony in  new york tony yeah good morning guys  uh listen there is a restaurant in  long beach called shines and they serve  horseshoe crab with butter garlic and  white wine they throw it under the  broiler it's unbelievably delicious what  part of it do you eat there's no meat 
[02:03:30]  on that stupid thing they they suck out  the meat from the claws it's like a  black man lobster it's absolutely  racism is running rampant in this  country rampant no i think mostly of  this show oh man they feel free to speak  their minds get it what is the black  man's lobster in a horseshoe crab no  crap all right i'm checking out what no  tony what's the black man's lobster  you're adding horseshoe crab to that  category well it's crawfish you find 
[02:04:00]  them on the beach they're inexpensive  crawfish you know they eat  they love the galls you catch in the  bay you know that's what they do that's  what they like and shines though it's  a great one though it's really good uh  we should try horseshoe crab how do we  get some of that shit we get that long  beach and uh you know fucking eat no  horseshoe crab guarantee half the staff  gets food poison that's not because of  that restaurant i don't even i didn't  even hear what restaurant i'm just  saying in general if we eat horseshoe  crab half of us would get food poison  oh that's how they serve it it looks 
[02:04:30]  like it just washed up that's  disgusting you know off white wine  garlic plenty of butter white wine  garlic and butter you could cook  cardboard in that it would taste  delicious exactly that's the problem  yeah when you say plenty of butter you  know it's shit right oh look they use  the shell as a bowl it's a good deal  man it's a good deal i think it's like  seven dollars for a whole horseshoe  seven a whole horseshoe wow there's  nothing in it you get the whole  horseshoe do you wow that's nice i 
[02:05:00]  gotta go to work they just remind me a  low tide smell at crab meadow beach of  course of course yeah you want to eat a  horseshoe crab never i think we gotta  try if i was starving where's roland  you got to find us some horseshoe crab  oh there's a great horseshoe crab place  up there it's 46th and 9th yeah it's  uh what are the phone topics at the  morning mashup today well um there's a  debate over whether or not nicole is a  douchey tweeter her tweets are becoming  douchey do we follow her even i don't 
[02:05:30]  know wow i don't even know if i do she's  not posting titty pictures i mean we  what are you following why bother right  and uh here's the this is the main one  i think better to be the third wheel or  the ninth wheel what does that mean well  would you is it better to hang out with  a couple by yourself wheel or with a  bunch of couples by yourself  you're kidding right watch that's this  topic they should be so fired you don't 
[02:06:00]  like that i know it's stupid third wheel  well it's like wait third wheel so eight  wheels would be four couples and then  you're the last one  roland's a third wheeler  roland you're a big third wheeler you're  a go-to third wheeler people like you  around yeah yeah he is if you gotta have  a third wheel uh roland's the guy my  old uh our old pal jay was a great  third wheeler yep another good third  wheel sure if you have a bad relationship  you get someone like jay around and it  made the days go by a lot fucking 
[02:06:30]  quicker yeah i go drinking whoever i'm  in so what's the nine wheeler so now you  got four couples and then uh that would  be weird yeah that wow which is weirder  wait now we're discussing it you  motherfucker discussing this because  the thing about the third wheel is yeah  that if the couple starts getting  romantic there's always more people  there's nobody else there but if you're  the ninth wheel and one of the couple  starts getting romantic there's still  other couples you can jump in what is  getting romantic mean what are they  talking about usually if you're third 
[02:07:00]  wheeling the couple isn't going to be  getting romantic no they might cuddle or  something or say something cute or  else there wouldn't have been a third  wheel they wouldn't have invited a  third wheel by the way it's a great  topic no phone calls on this topic  one please not a one that's it that's  all they have not a one is it a  screener issue or is it the no it's  not a screening issue we had we had  full phones with horseshoe crabs i mean  full people couldn't get through they  couldn't wait to talk about horseshoe  crabs that's a dumb topic one of our  topics instead yeah see if it's a

[02:10:00]  fucking banned if you keep this up you  must tell me what part of the horseshoe  crab i know the stinger thing or  whatever the fuck that thing is called  whatever that is that's what killed that  dude  no that was a stingray  there's a stingray oh my bad there's a  complete freak accident by the way and  why are they dangerous to the central 
[02:10:30]  nervous system what do they do it says  horseshoe crabs not what does it say at  the top of that horseshoe crabs are not  good to eat but scientists scientists good  good article nice article lady in a sailor  hand wrote it oh god what uh what's the  problem with the horseshoe crab  what is it what well did the uh she  hasn't told you yet still now that you  explain you need more info no no no no 
[02:11:00]  what the fuck they just throw it out  there and give no info no you're not  trying to explain you're not trying  dr steve is not available to explain  why a horseshoe crab is dangerous to eat  trying to pawn it off on dr steve i don't  think he's an expert on that shit holy  shit come on tell me under parts now now  it just says under parts what which  part of the under part what is it in it  that affects your central nervous system i'm  gonna go with some holy shit of toxin 
[02:11:30]  contains neurotoxin similar to those  found in spiders and by the way that's  adam from the uk not uh this stupid  sushi and they don't have horseshoe crabs  there i would assume or do they i don't  know i don't know they probably call them  something stupid yeah like a lorry crab  the lorry crab they have to make  everything sound nicer and store stupid  i don't know why get it stupid fucking  england so it's the uh the toxins yeah i  would assume the loo crab it's called a 
[02:12:00]  bathroom the loo crab yeah yeah sam still  doesn't know no i don't know no we don't  know why uh it's poisonous or terrible  there's toxins okay all right so they got  some toxins they do look just like some  kind of fucking filter oh well i'm getting  a text message from dr steve and he's  sending me a link so now i'm hitting the  link poisoning from eating horseshoe crab  and it's prevention and treatment well 
[02:12:30]  let's see okay uh this uh says during the  past three years investigating and studying  the poisoning of eating poison of eating  horseshoe crabs major cause of the poisoning  on eating horseshoe crabs in the south region  of the sea coast taking tetroditoxin  from carcinogonibus 
[02:13:00]  oh you know i forgot until just this moment  that my brother's a marine biologist oh my  god that's right because he he just wrote  me you dissed horseshoe crabs so i'm  writing back why they uh poisonous to eat  there why they poisonous to eat there what  the fuck to eat nobody wants to eat them  anyway no one they don't look delicious no  they don't they look terrible no the guy  said you put in a lot of butter garlic and  white wine and they're delicious you 
[02:13:30]  guys an idiot butter and garlic in white  wine and drink it and it would be delicious  delicious those things are delicious very  good point you know a very good point it  doesn't look like it is meant to be eaten i  even a lobster looks weird but it's like got  parts on it that are meaty you know right and  it turns a nice like red color it's pretty  that's like this brown lump of shit look  we're in good hands i got the i got the word  into my marine biologist brother all 
[02:14:00]  righty we're just waiting now so we'll uh we'll  get the answer yes i know it's something to do  with the toxins that build up lots of  within its uh within its tissue dr steve let's  see here within its tissue just read the last  paragraph genius that's what he wrote yeah  oh the thus then part all right let's see  every article needs a thus then let's see  thus then um hold on what do you got on the  thus then i gotta go down to the last paragraph as  per dr steve okay um oh god 
[02:14:30]  the size of wait this is this is stupid it is  very easy to be confused and easy to eat by  mistake the treatment of poisoning from  eating horseshoe crab is similar to treatment  of tetroditoxin by uh removing the toxins from  the body uh eating horseshoe crab i got the  answer allergic reaction oh you do yeah my 
[02:15:00]  question to my marine uh biologist brother  after he said you dissing horseshoe crabs i  wrote why they poisonous to eat he wrote because  they taste like shit oh no help there no help  there but um we just don't eat them like why  who wants to eat a horseshoe crab because the  guy said they're delicious no he's wrong so that  piques your curiosity where you're thinking all  right maybe they are maybe we're missing out on  something if they were that delicious more  than that guy would know sam you don't like uh  steak so you're out of this uh conversation i 
[02:15:30]  enjoy your horseshoe crab sorry sorry would  you eat uh horseshoe crab roll doesn't  appetizing doesn't look appetizing of course  not a taste of it looks horrendous it's the  similar symptoms if you're allergic to shrimp and  whatnot and you eat it that's what'll happen if  you eat a horseshoe crab well i'm sure that  happens with a lot of crustaceans that's a dumb  looking fucking thing stop eating stop eating  it it's a bowl it's just retarded looking oh sorry 
[02:16:00]  well are we allowed to use that word yeah you  could use retarded if it's just something you  know it doesn't look typical it's not a typical  crab it's a special crap all right we got dr steve all  right i'm failing miserably dr steve uh and and gave it  to college try even though you didn't go to college  oh that's why but uh apparently there are two  varieties of horseshoe crab and one is poisonous and  the other is not and it's very difficult when they're 
[02:16:30]  young to uh tell the difference so yeah but don't eat  the ones that are uh you know that are young because  you look right uh so you got to count on the rest  restaurant tour to know which crabs to pick up off the  beach apparently and that article was from china that's the  problem in china i don't know that it's a problem in the  united states we may not have the the poisonous variety so  i think that's where you know there is a poisonous variety 
[02:17:00]  that has the tetrodotoxin in it which is the same  toxin that um puffer fish have i mean you've heard about  the blue fish right and i uh a japanese restaurant you know it's kind of a uh  uh a fad yeah delicacy and then if you eat it uh and it's prepared wrong you die  yeah that's that seems like a lot of fucking pressure man  yeah you know we own a restaurant in my family and you worry about people choking 
[02:17:30]  now you got to worry if your chef is cutting up the blowfish properly  yeah they got to be certified to do it and even then people still die from it  man if they if they do it right you you get this  odd tingling and numbness in your mouth and that's supposed to be part of the  delicacy  it's just getting a little bit of poison  right  a little bit of it  oh man  who would take that chance  i'll just take some fucking like uh some trout  and then you just put some ambasol on it 
[02:18:00]  there you go  and then you eat it like that same shit  i bet you the blowfish tastes like shit  i bet you it does  what part do they uh remove of the blowfish so you don't get too much poison  it's if there's some gland near the gill  i'm not that i'm not an expert on that i don't know  but you leave a little gland  yeah well  or do you squeeze out what's in the gland a little bit after you prepare it  like a lemon  yeah like a lemon  squeezing blowfish gland on your food  blowfish gland  that sounds horrendous  that's just a blowfish gland 
[02:18:30]  yeah  the way i understand it is if it's removed properly there's just enough left behind to give you the tingly effect  hey dr steve so uh height of hay fever season i've been suffering for almost a week now  called up uh my dumb allergist who loves uh talking about the radio show instead of really focusing on his patient  yeah  all that stuff  he actually said i finally uh 
[02:19:00]  i finally gave a listen to you guys and uh  you guys aren't  you guys aren't that funny  and then i'm thinking is it a stupid  stupid dry jewish humor  or was he  wow  or did he mean what he said  holy shit he said that  and i have no idea  why would he say that  because he's a weird fucking dude  then you should tell him you know uh  i've been to a lot of allergists  you're not really the best  you're pretty bad as an allergist  i think he was just  how does that feel fucko  i think he was just trying to have fun  but i don't know  and i honestly don't know 
[02:19:30]  what the answer is  you sure it wasn't one of those  i don't like you guys  i love you guys  i don't know  oh god  but anyway  he uh  he gave me cortisone pills  okay  what the fuck is that about  well that do  it's making me a bit irritable  and on edge  yeah you got a lot of inflammation  in your head  and uh  he's just trying to calm it down  it's  that's okay  in the short term  what you want to tell him  to put you on  allegra  is a drug called  singular 
[02:20:00]  i thought it was allegra  singular  allegra's fine  allegra's an antihistamine  it's a non-drousy antihistamine  and that'll dry up  the uh  the fluid  that's in your nose  fluid  fluid  it's more like  um  upper respiratory  ears  now  what you want  is an anti-inflammatory  that's not  steroidal  and so  steroidal  what the fuck does that mean  well you're on steroids  steroidal  so should i go to the gym today 
[02:20:30]  i got a lot in me  different kind of  steroids  yeah  your head will be all  fucking muscular  they say  if you  if you get puffy face  from the cortisone  to stop it immediately  and uh  consult your doctor  oh  yeah  and if you get diabetes  and all that  so all of that  will only happen  if you take it  for a prolonged period  of time  no  and that's the problem  with it  it works great  but uh  you can only  take pulses of it  you know  you take it for  six days  or twelve days  then you gotta quit 
[02:21:00]  what is something  with side effects  of  of uh  cortisone  uh pills  yeah  well  fluid retention  irritability  i can jack you up  it can increase  your appetite  you're on your period  that's pretty much it  it gives you the  yeah it gives you a period  it gives you a period  that's great  sleeplessness  oh yeah  i had four hours sleep  last night  yeah  uh  but he told me  allegra  after this is done  well this stuff  singular  you can take  with the allegra  and it just calms down 
[02:21:30]  the inflammation  in your body  and uh  without having any  of the effects  of being a steroid  it's great  well i know i'm on  allegra  or singular  i'm sorry  i'm sorry  well i know i'm on it  meaning like  will i get a little drowsy  will i get a little irritable  no no no  the singular's got  you know  unless you have  an adverse reaction  to it's got  no side effects  at all  it's almost  the perfect allergy drug  he told me  just to leg it up  i know  well  bring it up  to him  say hey  what do you think  about the singular's  why then i'll talk 
[02:22:00]  about the show again  i don't even know  what i'm allergic to  i went through  all the tests  but he  he was too busy  to talk about  the opian anthony show  like oh  weren't you the guys  in the church  all that shit  i'm like  well what am i allergic to  he goes  oh a lot  he goes  oh a lot of things  he goes  anyway  i'm like  the reason i'm here  is i need the list  give me the list  so i can avoid shit  well it's probably pollen  and stuff that you can't avoid  he said uh  he said trees and grass  i'm like okay good 
[02:22:30]  but what kind of trees  and what kind of grass  he goes trees and grass  all kinds  every tree  every bit of grass  so that means i can't lay around  in the grass  can't do anything  fuck  well this is fascinating  but you know one thing  that you could do  is  motherfucker  he just called us out  on being boring  there's a lot of allergy  sufferers out there  this means something  to somebody  it's your phone call  motherfucker  that's right  hey  you have a HEPA filter  for your house  it really helps  my kid has  horrendous allergies  erock has a HIPPO filter  it's different  why didn't erock go 
[02:23:00]  to the big birthday party  i don't know  he had something  better to do i guess  oh i'm sorry  i missed your party  yeah i love to  i know  what did you do this weekend  nothing  sat around  sat around  oh  i'll tell you what i didn't do  drive my ass all the way  to fucking westchester  why not  it's tomato warning  sorry  it was the greatest  the weather wasn't right  i was hanging out  and by the way  i wasn't hanging out alone  my friend  you said you were just  hanging out  i was just hanging out  you should have  taken the ride  we had a birthday party 
[02:23:30]  in the rain  sounds great  well we weren't actually  standing only roland  actually was  roland was completely soaked  i don't know  he's just a weird dude  uh oh  he got drunk  within 40 minutes  of being there  i mean it wasn't even  like that type of thing  dude it wasn't like  a let's get hammered party  no it was like  have a couple beers  have a couple cocktails  were you just slamming  yeah motherfucker  yeah  and then roland  hold on  we'll get back to you  dr steve  because we're really  good at this shit  roland troy  and his chick  decide they have to 
[02:24:00]  get back  troy was roland's chick  at this point  he was jealous  and uh  these three hipsters  decide they've had  enough uh  of westchester  and they want to  get back to the city  they had some kind of  very very lame  like excuses  why they had to  get back to the city  super lame  so that's good  you're gonna leave  the party early  fine  these idiots  force sam's mom  to bring out  the birthday cake  and all the fucking  desserts early  so they can have  a little piece  so they can get  back to their  hipster lifestyle 
[02:24:30]  troy actually  went to my dad  and said  hey uh  were you thinking  about i don't know  when you were thinking  about bringing the cake  because we have to  kind of get out of here  troy  who says that  no one  that's fucking rude  man that is so  fucking rude  we've opened at a  party where you know  something good's coming  up and you're like  fuck but you know  you have to leave  you don't force that  that's not even  fucking hand  no  then you just  then you just  fucking say  look i gotta go  right  you know  take a rain check  on a piece of cake  plus they were  making jess 
[02:25:00]  drive them to  the train station  oh man  so i was like  you know sam's wife  yeah  she had to drive  him back to the  train station  why don't you do  the polite thing  and just not mention  it if jess has to  drive you  we'll have dessert  when jess gets back  so she doesn't have  to miss it and rush  through it but no  they'd rather make  sure they get their  cake and make  everybody you know  you are horrible  fucking party guests  they're the worst  terrible  roland was drunk  40 minutes in  it starts raining  and like we're all  just kind of sitting  chit chatting  because everybody 
[02:25:30]  just got there  and roland decides  it's time to go out  and frolic in the  rain by himself  oh so you got all  soaking wet in the  rain  yeah  why  because he's  i don't know  that's drunk  and then he walked  into the glass door  he's our jambalushi  he's our jambalushi  yeah  he walked into the  glass door  he walked into the  glass door  yeah  oh man  it's embarrassing  and his mom made  these delicious  chicken fingers  oh  oh i wouldn't  know  of course  i know  uh oh  but they're  slightly late  they're all gone 
[02:26:00]  because roland  just roland  like devoured  picked out on  him  he ate them  all  yeah it was  like a little  appetizer for  everybody  jesus  here comes  troy kwan  oh troy  he didn't  troy doesn't  have a good  time when the  party's not  about him  oh man  how bored  were you at  the party  that was fun  but you made  uh sam's parents  bring out the  desserts early  because you guys  had to get on a  train  and the ice cream  well i mean we  did come a long  way  the homemade ice  cream by the  way  yeah  homemade ice  cream  what  oh yeah  and an ice 
[02:26:30]  cream thing  like an ice  cream  fucking porcelain  thing with  plastic over the  top  it wasn't  porcelain  it was steel  whatever the  fuck it is  i don't know  it's like six  hours to make a  fucking spoonful  of ice cream  yeah it takes a  while  it tastes pretty  fucking good  though  it looks silly  as all hell  that you make  your own ice  cream but  was he cranking  a crank  it was delicious  did he have to  crank his crank  i don't think he  cranked anyone's  crank  no  there isn't a  crank on there  you gotta crank  well i didn't  see him so i  don't know for  sure if he  cranked someone's  it was just a  finished product  yeah 
[02:27:00]  so why do you  leave early  and why do you  take desserts  with you  well  oh no that  was me  then roland  took cupcakes  in his hands  on his way  i thought it  wasn't weight  what's going on  i'm so confused  now roland's way  off the wagon  on everything  oh roland  get back on  you're looking  good  i want that  boost  i mean and  you have no  idea the volume  of food that he  consumed  yesterday  there's more  booze than  food  wow  we were loaded  at like two  o'clock in the  afternoon  now uh  how do you go 
[02:27:30]  up to the  the party  the people  throwing the  party and tell  them they need  to serve the  cake now  well  that did go  down  wow  jess was like  he didn't really  do that  and i was like  yeah jess was  like i had to  miss eating cake  to drive them  oh my god  because he made  it so that he  had to get  his cake  early  well first  of all i told  sam that you  know we don't  have a ride  from the train  station to  wherever his  parents house  is so he's  like yeah no  no problem  we'll get  we'll get  you picked  up so that  he did  offer so 
[02:28:00]  he's kind  of he's  letting that  out where  he offered  to take  us but  then jess  would drive  you and  then come  back and  then we'd  all enjoy  cake together  well i  just don't  have to leave  in the middle  of dessert  to drive  you because  you had to  have your  dessert first  well no my  girlfriend had  to work  at night  so um  i said to her  work you gotta  work that's  why it's called  work not play  sometimes you  miss dessert  well it just  sucks that we've  come all that  way yeah  you know it is  a birthday party  you know and not  have any birthday  cake that just  seems ridiculous  to me the cake 
[02:28:30]  was gonna be  served within a  half hour giving  you guys plenty  of time to get  on a later train  yeah back to  your really like  what was going  on in any way  i mean it was  just like we just  just stand in  there oh  and by the way  it went on for  another hour and  a half two hours  after they left  so it wasn't  like they left  and then it  ended it was  like okay  finally now we  can just hang  out with the  right and not  worry about you  know making sure  they're okay  exactly make sure  troy doesn't get  any like you  know crumbs on  his nice new  clothes or  whatever  i did prepare 
[02:29:00]  my little dessert  plate early  we don't have  to worry about  roland breaking  something because  he's intoxicated  and nobody else  is  and you're also  forgetting that he  was blurting out  obscenities  while the family  was around  oh man  my parents  all these two  year old  roland  roland's just  dropping f-bombs  and making  references to  troy looking like  adolf hitler  i'm just like i  don't need this  like i thought i  had made it clear  what this was  and it was fun  it was a good time  yeah 
[02:29:30]  yeah i had a good  time  you think eric's  pissed that you  made it to west  chester but didn't  make it to jersey for  his party  well it's easier to  get to west chester  than it is to get  out there  if you say so  i don't even know  where i mean that's  just it's not even  close to true  that's not right  no man there's  something happens  with the gps going  to your neck of the  woods  yeah  yeah i go a  different way every  fucking time i don't  know why  i give you directions  i tried going to  one party i'm not  gonna do it again  not for anyone in  this motherfucking  place  i'm sorry  rob ruined it for  you  oh man  i showed up and  been the life of 
[02:30:00]  the party  well more importantly  why didn't eric show  up  he had better things  to do  he was busy  drinking all weekend  in the train i was a  little gassy too  he was offending  everybody on the train  oh  they were loud  just some drunk guy  farting on the train  you know  and it's already  miserable because it  was that horrible  storm that came  through so everyone's  just wet and just  wants to get home  wow and roland's wet  so he's humidifying  the whole train  oh my god  roland's been on a  roll lately  we were coming home  from madonna and he 
[02:30:30]  tried to start an  aids chant on the  subway  what do you mean  an aids chant  people are like  madonna and yankees  i went aids aids aids  and then people  stopped  it's just a weird  he said he didn't  have a good time  with madonna  no i said i said  i didn't enjoy her  concert but i had a  good time  oh right  we had fun  we had a good time  speaking of madonna  why is the media  pointing out that  the obama tattoo  that she has on her  lower back is a fake  tattoo  yeah really  why wouldn't they  say that though  but they're going  with it  she tattooed  obama's name  on her body  that's fake 
[02:31:00]  that  it's not a real  tattoo  of course  anyone could do  that  why is that edgy  look she's in  her bra  with obama  that's a fake  tattoo  keep your fucking  clothes on  grandma  but they're all  talking about  oh my god  she tattooed  obama's name  on her lower  back  no she didn't  nipples are  showing through  oh  it's a temporary  tattoo  so obvious  yeah  yeah whatever  madonna was good  bad  indifferent  i took a little  nap  we were in a box  and he literally 
[02:31:30]  laid down on the  floor and took a  nap  he was hammered  there too  completely hammered  i was like  loaded yeah  what's going on  with you man  you gotta get  back on that  i know  on the wagon  yeah i was thinking  i was gonna say  wagon but it's a  food thing and an  alcohol thing  i'm surprised  troy didn't try  to make madonna  get to the hits  a lot quicker  so he could get  out of there  and do some  other stuff  she uh what  montages our  hits now  yeah like little  clips  there was like  five songs  that i knew  the rest of  it was a whole  new album  what are you  doing  she loves 
[02:32:00]  she loves  boring people  with her new  shit  i think the  only full  old song  she was singing  was vogue  express herself  that was one  thing she did  she did the  express herself  into a  she wants to  make sure she  does express  herself  express herself  into uh  the lady gaga  born this way  yeah  tell her to  drop it  oh she's doing  that  yeah  i thought they  would be  friends by now  madonna knew  what was good  for her  they're frenemies  gaga ripped off  her shit  that's right  i'm with you  on that  jesus christ  all right  anything else 
[02:32:30]  on the birthday  party steve  was so bored  he hung up  on us  and my brother  wants to take  him to task  oh yeah  because i guess  the horseshoe crabs  in our area  aren't poisonous  where are they  poisonous  he goes uh  uh  our horse crabs  or horseshoe crabs  are not toxic  and poisonous blowfish  aren't here too  so we do have  uh blowfish in the  in the long island  waters there  long island  not poisonous ones  right  no they're not  poisonous  it's only a  specific asian  species  that you have  to watch out  for  oh yeah  yeah  yeah 
[02:33:00]  if dr steve  is giving you  fucking shoddy  marine bio advice  maybe i should be  giving you  shitty medical advice  oh man  he is pissed  but dr steve  didn't say that  they'll blow fish  in our area  no  no he was talking  about when they  prepare it  though we had  something over  there  where's over  there  uh  japan  oh  and then uh  as far as  horseshoe crabs  being poisonous  we didn't say  which horseshoe crabs  are from what area  we just said  you know  horseshoe crabs  and then dr steve 
[02:33:30]  just wrote  and he did say  they were two  different types  he wrote  sorry buddy  i have to get  into rounds  no you don't  your patients  are dying  they can wait  sort of wait  i guess  oh  well it's nothing  he's gonna do  to make their  lives better  it's the weirdest  job ever  by the way  troy kwan  could be the  meanest person  i've ever seen  on twitter  why what did  he do  oh you saw  that yesterday  what did  he really does  have no regard  it was so bad  i'm taking after  the school of  thought of roland  because roland  will just sit  there and  everybody that  blasts him on 
[02:34:00]  instagram  he will sit  there and reply  he'll go through  everybody's instagram  and be like oh  their wife is fat  and go back  right  and be like  and then blast  and then i was  just like well  i was talking  about that too  and i do that  too i i told  some woman  uh that was  giving me shit  i i looked at  her picture  uh her profile  picture on twitter  and it was her  holding her daughter  and her daughter  had a giant head  but it was probably  just the picture  and her daughter  was a kid  and kids always  got bigger heads  i think it was  forced perspective  and it was a little  forced perspective  right 
[02:34:30]  but i just said  your kid's got  a giant head  and i left it at that  and then other people  started just commenting  impassionable  and she deleted  a twitter account  so i was very happy  with that victory  but um  troy took it uh  way over the  fucking line  i did you know  or did you just assume  and then it turned out  to be correct  well i looked at the kid  and he looked like  he was a mongoloid  oh my god  what did he do  he said  your kid  looks like a mongoloid  i guess the apple  doesn't fall far  from the tree  but what did this guy  do to troy 
[02:35:00]  to deserve that  he said troy looks  like a douche  douchebag  and then tags anthony  on him  why tag anthony  on that  and i was like  okay well  and that opens  the door for you  to like look  at someone's looks  but man  it was his son  and then i looked  going like  alright maybe his son  just looks stupid  in the picture  his son was  absolutely  had down syndrome  why would that guy  do that  absolutely had down syndrome  a little downy  and then he responded  he's like yeah  my son has down syndrome  i said you know  i'm sure you get 
[02:35:30]  a lot of twitter sympathy  by putting your  retarded kid  on fucking twitter  you deleted them  it's not  i deleted them  yeah  because i was like  that's a not typical kid  a not typical kid  but it's like  the confusion i have there  is he's making fun  of your looks  knowing that  that is very  he's a water baby  available  to some you know  to someone to make fun  of back  if you're going  down that road  exactly  here's the thing  that i see  right or wrong  look  what troy did  right or wrong  it's a weird  odd situation 
[02:36:00]  that doesn't fall  there's no rules  there's no rules  it's a weird thing  that falls into  a strange situation  let me try to explain  here  he's  very proud  of his son  obviously  and wants to  feature him  in his profile picture  now i guess  at some point  you probably do  have to keep in mind  i gotta watch  what i say  because there's a lot  of people that  will just fucking  take the opportunity  to be really  scumbaggy to me  so he kind of  was wrong in that  but 
[02:36:30]  i mean i know  there's no rules  technically speaking  but there is a  tad of  morality  that i think  no  i'm sorry  in the twitter world  it's just  anything  it's  anything goes  i mean if you're  gonna take a shot  at me  i don't know  who you are  so if you're  gonna take a shot  at me  then it's  open game  to you  fair enough  that's how  troy feels  and roland's  the best at it  roland's really  kind of  roland's amping  me up  the only thing  wrong with  roland's response  is that he  never puts  any punctuation  in  so it's just  these crazy 
[02:37:00]  run-on sentences  of awfulness  and people just  give up  they don't even  know what the  hell he's saying  it just sounds  but nothing better  than the guy  will write back  to roland  and go  hey man  i was just  kidding  and you could  tell they were  deeply fucking  hurt by his  or my favorite  i'll do is  report abuse  and i delete  all my uh  things i wrote  so when they  go look back  at instagram  they're like  wow  this person's  an asshole  and then tag  him  oh  because you  delete all  your bad  stuff  and it looks  like he's  just being a  dick  for nothing  yeah you report  abuse 
[02:37:30]  i got four  people kicked  off of instagram  roland's a  sick fuck  i'm telling you  he's a dick  we went out  we went out  to a diner  the other night  and he was  just firing  at everybody  because we  posted the  picture of him  urinating in  a phone booth  and people were  like you have  no dick  where is it  and we didn't  say anything  the whole time  at the diner  because he was  just sitting  there responding  to people  and trying to  get them  kicked off  instagram  can we get  some of  these responses  i delete them  and then 
[02:38:00]  he reports  abuse  now that he's  announced his  plan on the air  don't you think  that the next time  you respond to  somebody they're  going to try to  get you kicked  off  fuck them  there you go  sal wanted to  go at it with  troy but he's  just talking about  sal call back  oh boy  i know where  you're calling  from call back  i thought you  didn't know  like i thought  you just thought  the kid looked  like that  but was you  know a normal  kid  and then  when i  looked  and i  you know  when you  see the  picture 
[02:38:30]  and you  click on  it once  but then  you got  to make  it bigger  sometimes  like that  picture can  change drastically  within those  three types  of pictures  you see the  initial one  it's very  small on your  phone  then you  click  it's like  and then  i'm like  uh oh  and then  i got the  biggest picture  and i'm like  oh he has  down syndrome  he looked a  little off  but i didn't  know  but if the  guy's making  fun of your  looks  like he's  got to  expect that  the first thing  you're going  to think  about is  making fun  of his  no he's  probably  well it's  his not  his son's  you know  or whatever's  you know 
[02:39:00]  publicly available  i understand  i understand  the mindset  of it  i mean morally  you might want  to check yourself  well i mean  don't go after me  and i won't go  after you  i don't know  who you are  i'm not taking  you took  the he took  the first shot  right  that's the way  i look at it  so it's like  anything's fair  game  friendship  between troy  and roland  is pure  evil  it really  is  we definitely  wind each  other up  it's the alliance  of fucking  evil  it really  is  the evil  alliance  oh and uh  i'm noticing  things about  pictures  the smaller  the avatar 
[02:39:30]  the uglier  you are  you know now  where like  you click on a  link and someone's  sending pictures  out but now  they're  they're really  tiny  and then you  make them  bigger and  they're all  pixelated  and you can  tell that  yeah they're  just trying  to cover up  a world of  hurt  yeah  you know i  just realized  what  troy and  roland both  used to be  like e-rock's  best friend  at the office  uh-huh  and now they  only hang out  with each other  yeah they never  invite e-rock  with them  why don't you  hang out  with e-rock  he's always  at his house  we invite him  don't hang out  with e-rock 
[02:40:00]  oh okay  he didn't go  to his house  because he said  he has a lot  of shit going  on  well it's hard  for me to get  out there  he said his  time is valuable  and that's why  he didn't go  to e-rock  well look  he didn't get  a dj gig  while you were at  his party  what's that  with sam  remember  who's dj gig  i don't know  what he's talking  hey you know  what those uh  you know what  the um  profile pics  on twitter  are like  uh with a lot  of girls  you see that  you notice this  with  it's like  getting sober  because you 
[02:40:30]  you look at  the small picture  you're like  hey she's  cute  right  and then you  click on it  gets a little  bigger  and you're like  well i'm not  sure now  and then you get  the biggest one  and you're like  oh jesus  so it's like  you're at the  bar all hammered  and then as  you sober up  you kind of  get more of an  appreciation of  what the uh  the looks are  that's pretty funny  or she's cute in her  picture and then you  start scrolling through  other pictures  yeah yeah  and you get a full  body shot  and you're like  whoa  but it's it's just  so it's amazing  how that how your  judgment can change  from the initial  picture till you 
[02:41:00]  look at the full  size of the same  exact picture  you ever see uh  have we talked  about this where  you see an avatar  you're like holy  shit that looks  like an amazing  set of breasts  i gotta fucking  click that  make that bigger  and then it's  like someone  drinking tea  you're fucking  insane  i'm not the only  one  but you know  what i mean  you're so tit  obsessed  oh  that's hilarious  that was just  my that was my  go-to example  to be honest  with you  but you'll see  something like  whoa that looks  like i'm trying  to think of one  that i've actually 
[02:41:30]  seen  and it's completely  different than  what you thought  it was  it's like some  guy with a kid  on his shoulders  right  and it's the  kneecaps  right  you're like  hey look at  those tits  let me  oh it's a kid  up on daddy's  shoulders  sure  i wish i had  a better example  yeah  but some of  these fucking  little tiny avatar  pictures will  trick you  they really are  deceiving  anyone have a  good example  of one  that they've  come across  where they  thought it  was something  and then it  turns out to be  completely different  there's your  phone topic  there's another 
[02:42:00]  one  give us a call  now please  there's your  phone topic  yeah  wow man  did erock explain  why you didn't  go to the birthday  party i wasn't  listening  no  well why didn't  you go erock  i was told it was a  family event and i  didn't want to uh  what to go after other  people complained about  not being invited  and there's  and there's the sam look  again which we all have  gone through that weird  like what is he talking  about i'm telling you  what i'm talking about  holy  stop the vague shit  i'm not being vague at all  i'm going off sam's 
[02:42:30]  sam you take this i was  fighting your battle i'm  sorry that i got involved  holy shit  because the look i saw  from sam sam's like  what that's not what i  said  sam was the one looking  like you don't know  what the fuck you're  talking about i was just  bringing the visual to  everyone's uh imaginations  because when i asked him  he said no uh uh me and  my wife might have  something to do but now  he's saying that he  didn't go because he  didn't know if other  people weren't invited  no  lying erock comment  no i said i was told it  was a family barbecue  sam's family was a family 
[02:43:00]  barbecue because we  weren't originally invited  did you know opie was  going  yeah  did you know did you  know troy was going  troy was the one who  complained that he wasn't  invited  yeah i complained too  and roland and then when  i was invited and sam was  nice and he invited me and  i said no that's all right  you know because we had  other things to do but it  was his family thing we  weren't just going to go to  a party where it seemed  like  did you have  did you have things to  do or was it a family  event what was the reason  we went out to dinner with  her cousins that's the  reason that's the reason 
[02:43:30]  thank you  why don't you just say  that in the first place  that's why i brought it  up because it seemed a  little strange  it didn't make any sense  especially the look that  sam gave  sam is so  annoyed with you  right now  of course he was invited  after the fact that it  was told i was told that  it was a family barbecue  but then he made it clear  that it wasn't  first of all stop saying  i was told say so and  so told me  you told me  all right  you're at a family  barbecue  but iraq didn't he  now i am involved  didn't he make it very  obvious that it wasn't  just a family barbecue  at that point 
[02:44:00]  i said my parents are  throwing a barbecue  so why would you still  think it was a family  barbecue  yeah yeah  you know opie's going  i'm inviting you  i invited troy  i invited roland  and my friend chuck  was there  and jimmy and it  and i invited jimmy  i invited an am  i like the chuckster  yeah that's what you  call him  i want to go  drink with him  i'm going old school  with my nicknames  the oakster and the  chuckster  i like the chuckster  i want to go drink  with his friend  chuck  yeah  huh  i'm going to  drink with him  he's a good time  yeah he's all right  yeah  so we rocked  didn't go because  it was a family  barbecue  well that's 
[02:44:30]  understandable  family barbecue  it's totally  i wish you would have  told me that  irrelevant information  yeah  you're the one who  complained like a  bitch saying  like why wasn't i  invited and then  when he invited you  you said you didn't  want a pity invite  a bitch  yeah  you want to start  with me now  okay get evil  go do your character  go ahead  oh it's a character  we weren't invited  originally  and then when he  said we were going  you were the one  who complained  that you said  this is a pity invite  i was goofing  around with him  we were out for 
[02:45:00]  his birthday lunch  and i was goofing  around  i think troy knew  that it wasn't the  case of people  not being invited  it was that it  wasn't an event  and then it was  an event  so i was like  oh we're inviting  people and i will  invite some people  so yeah so he  never invited me  then and it was  fine and then he  texted me that day  and said you were  invited roland was  invited  yeah like all  joking aside  yeah all joking  aside look i'm  having a couple  people over come  over if you want  to come i said  yeah dude i'd  love to come  it just seemed  like bitch  so why do you  have to bring up  this other shit  of like oh  this is this was 
[02:45:30]  supposed to be a  family event  because it was  and it seemed  like you forced  an invitation  why would i force  an invitation  because you  weren't invited  it was a goof  it was his  birthday we're  clowning around  you know that  right you know  what joking around  is right i guess  i don't know  apparently not  okay  you go to that  you don't come  to mind  fuck you  whatever fuck  you  whoa  whatever  i'm glad you  didn't come  to my damn  party  oh wow  jeez watch the  language in there  they should come  to my damn  party  he's mad that  you didn't go  to this  well it's hard to 
[02:46:00]  get out there  i told him that  you go way back  this is what's  coming out today  and that troy when  pressed on it said  i got a lot of  shit going on and  my time is kind of  valuable at this  point  oh shit  well i mean  to be fair i picked  a good weekend  because you had  nothing going on  this weekend  right  which is a rare  thing but he did  have something going  on because he left  early with the  birthday  no i couldn't send  my girlfriend  home alone  i wanted to stay  i told you that  you probably could  have she's of the  age  that wasn't nice 
[02:46:30]  that wouldn't be a  nice thing to do  no it would have  been nice to be  like hey sam's  dead why don't you  bring out the cake  now  no i said  let me dictate  sam's party  but we're getting  off track i want  to know why  eric was happy  that troy didn't  come to his  damn party  yeah  is that your  quote  damn party  damn party  why are you  happy that he  didn't go  after hearing how  he behaved at  sam's party  he would have  probably done that  if not worse  at my party  had he decided  to come  oh boy  that's fine  don't invite me  to your party  then  he did invite you  he did originally 
[02:47:00]  yeah  and i would have  come it's just  hard to get out  there  were you offended  when he said  you were being  a bitch  i mean he  that's just  every day of his  life  he calls you  a bitch  every day  no he's a  bitch every  day of his  life  oh  okay man's  man tell me  about it  tell you about  it tell you  why you're a  bitch  should i tell  you why  you're a  bitch  you're the  one who's  complaining all  the time  go ahead  where should i  start  i don't know  you study me  every day  well i study  i saw when you  were chasing  rob thomas out  of the studio  to tell him 
[02:47:30]  that you remember  him from some  other spot  do you remember  me  do you remember  me rob  oh no  oh no  who's the  bitch  who's running  after rob thomas  do you remember  me from  wff  ufu  and he goes  rob it  of course  felt uncomfortable  and he's like  oh yeah i  thought i remembered  you  yeah  so he remembered  him  of course he  didn't remember  him  he gave a fake  yes  rob thomas  gave a fake  yes  so who's the  fucking bitch  that's such a  fucking turd  move  who's the 
[02:48:00]  bitch  you don't think  that's a turd  move  no  because that's  not what i  asked him  you think that's  cool to chase  rob thomas  after everybody  left  you're in here  taking pictures  then you have  to walk out  so you don't  say it in front  of anybody in  the studio  i would have  said it in  front of  no you  wouldn't have  you went and  you made sure  nobody was around  when you told  him because he  was about to  make the  corner here  and you're  like hey  rob do you  remember me  from w  uh  that's not  what i said  yes you did  i saw you  i said that i was  like that's not  what i said  well then what  did you say  rob he used  to do these um  these events for  another station i 
[02:48:30]  worked at every  year for a  children's hospital  and i said hey  i remember you  used to do these  events you were  really nice to me  at that time  and everything and  that's what it  was  that's pretty much  exactly what  tell me that's  not douchey dude  yeah come on  and troy did notice  it right away  because he he  told me like  right after  because it's  just such a  nagel move  what do you  mean because  he just wants  to like you  know be sneaky  like come over  and you know  say something  give his card  to somebody  like on the  side like 
[02:49:00]  here you know  like i'm the  man like you  need anything  you you hit me  up i mean  everybody knows  he does that  networking stupid  everybody knows  nobody will come  forward to  networking  troy  networking  but he won't  do it in front  of anybody  else  oh secret  networking  yeah it's  like on the  side  sly move  yeah  people seem  to like what  you've called  a nagel move  it's a real  nagel move  it's a lot  easier to get  to um  e-rocks than 
[02:49:30]  sims  yeah it probably  is  a lot  a lot easier  well i did  fuck up the  train going to  say but troy  yeah with your  farts  troy to  e-rocks is a  clear shot  yeah  it really is  that westchester  gets all fucking  weird and  it's expansive  well he won't  have to know how  to get there  anymore because  he's not invited  to any of the  parties  no more parties  for troy  kwan e-rock  he doesn't want  to go  where'd it go  bad for you  two you guys  used to be  best pals  a year or so  ago he just  started turning  into a real  dick towards me 
[02:50:00]  what was the  thing that  happened because  you guys were  like I wish I  could pinpoint it  to you  yeah  it was just  I really wish I  could but I  don't know but  it's over  just over a  year ago  but I've been  better I've been  better haven't I  oh yeah  troy what  happened though  was there an  incident  because everybody  knows like  look as a  human being I  like eric  nagel he's a  he's a nice  guy he really  is he comes  from good  stock he's  he's a good  dude I know  I've known him  for a long time  he's a good  dude but when  you work with  him there's just  little things that 
[02:50:30]  are just like  oh really dude  talking about the  rob thomas thing  again  that's just like  you know dude  it's just like one  thing like an  accumulation of  things and you're  just like but  yeah and then  the intern thing  last week  is there other  examples of really  dude the whole  intern thing last  week what intern  yeah well when he  told HR that I'm  going to be taking  over the interns  and that never that  was never the truth  that never happened  you were gonna  no I was never  told I was told 
[02:51:00]  that I was going to  cover it for him  the one week that  he was out  and that was it  Iraq any comment  about Troy  yeah because that  doesn't seem that  bad  Iraq  anything you want  to say as far as  why you guys are  like this  yeah  I wish I knew  well he said  because you're a  dick when you're  at work  okay I never  interact with him  and I haven't  oh you should  really in a long  time  but I've been good  right Eric  for a while I've  been really good  because I didn't  see you  well I've just  been I've been  nice haven't I  been nice 
[02:51:30]  you've been  yeah  okay I'm trying  to be a better  person I'll be  I know a lot  of this  what  I am  let me break  down  you're a much  worse person  with my first  let me break  this down to  basics  you guys  you guys  brought me  here  because I've  only got  pieces on  like Sam  show  some of the  stuff we do  here  Iraq  how close  were you  guys  um  we were  close early  on then there  was a there  was many years  that I didn't  see Troy  explain how  close  you called  each other  a lot  you drank 
[02:52:00]  together  what  what was  how close  I was in a  band we  we associated  with each  other  they were  close enough  that Troy  got blown  in Eric's  parents bathroom  wow  that is true  yeah we did  on that one  so  yeah  yeah it's  pretty close  right there  yeah  and then I  watched the guy  you consider yourselves  friends  at this point  it's not really  like  we shan't work  together again  it's not at a  friendship level  right now  did you look  down to him  or as an equal  there Troy  Kwan  when's that 
[02:52:30]  before  yeah  it was cool  he was  we were just  in a different  world  that means  you look  down at him  a little bit  tell the truth  you were the  rock star  and he was  the help  well  be an honest  guy  be an honest  guy  well it was  he was the  guy that  worked for  the radio  the radio  stations  and he was  able to  help out  the band  I was  working in  okay  so  you were  the lead  singer  for you  weren't  working  well I  was one  of a  couple  people  right  and he  was like  boy did  you hitch  your wagon  to the  wrong  guy  because  somebody else  I know  was in  that  situation 
[02:53:00]  hi  kind of  worked  out  well  not quite  hitching  my  my  star  to  a  nagle  I've  been good  in  Eric  I'm  trying  to be  better  because  Eric  just  gets  lambasted  on a  regular  basis  I'm  trying  to  by  you  but  I  think  Iraq  does  it  to  himself  a lot  because  he  does  how  he  explains  himself  is  really  confusing  that  was  a  typical  kind  of  Eric  explanation  that  was  just 
[02:53:30]  steeped  in  half  truths  and  vagary  and  then  he  gets  frustrated  and  starts  yelling  because  he  can't  express  himself  he  got  very  angry  that  we  were  going to  call him  out  on that  because  it  wasn't  a  family  barbecue  I  was  told  it  was  a  family  barbecue  but  then  he  made  it  clear  it  wasn't  you  had  plans  anyway  you  said  the  reason  you  didn't  go  was  because  it  was  a  family  barbecue  friends  outnumbered 
[02:54:00]  family  by the  way  from  people  wondering  everyone  started  getting  the  invite  it  just  seemed  like  a  last  minute  thing  on  Friday  where  other  people  were  saying  how come  we  weren't  invited  so  they  were  invited  and  I  didn't  want  to  do  that  to  Sam  when it  was  supposed  to be  a  family  thing  to  begin  with  but  you  didn't  do  anything  to  Sam  when you  were  still  invited  I  invited  people  I  liked  I  didn't  invite  anybody  that I  wouldn't  hang  out  with  the  food  was  delicious  your parents  are great  it's  nice and early  for you  Troy  it is a birthday  party  I'd like to 
[02:54:30]  have a little  bit of  birthday cake  we'd like you  to stay  your dad  said  have some  sangria  it's really  good  have a couple  of grill  asses  a couple  of grill  asses  a couple  of grill  asses  I had like  six  glasses  it was  delicious  I  fucking  love  the way  rolling  talks  it's  so  unique  how  do  you  say  glasses  some  sangria  he polished  off the  sangria 
[02:55:00]  too  did you  I had  two glasses  he had  six  you got  drunk  on  sangria  and then  beer  you didn't  puke  beer  and sangria  is just  a fucking  bomb  waiting  a vomit  bomb  waiting  to happen  it's a lot  of hostility  between  troy  and eric  we're fine  no  it's still  there  he's glad  he didn't  go to his  party  troy is  pulling the  we're good 
[02:55:30]  move  right now  by the way  this will  just simmer  until something  happens  of course  nothing's been  settled  which party  are you glad  he didn't  go to  the family  or the  friends  he was  invited to  the family  he was  invited to  the friends  one  so who  cares if  he acts  up there  that's just  crazy time  yeah  he'll  pussy  you don't  have to  worry  about  ants  and  those  weird  fucking  distant  relatives  that you  don't really  know  and if I have a way to get out there and I don't have to that night I had to DJ that night of his party if I don't have to DJ I would absolutely go out to Eric's and Eric and I have hung out and we've had a good time together 
[02:56:00]  when you  when was the last time you hung out  two years ago  two years ago  it wasn't like there were three or four different ways to get to Erox  one phone call  exactly you could have asked people I mean  I drove  I'm not going to ask you for a ride dude  why not  I drive  I drive Roland  he pops in my tiny back  fucking hatch area  on the way home  many times  drunk  like fucking kids  this is scary to you  he has hair  he understands the people around me now 
[02:56:30]  he couldn't wait to see Sam, he couldn't wait to see Jess  I go, what about Roland?  and he goes, no, Roro  he calls him Roro  no, Roro  and he meant it  he saw Roro and he just told me  he wanted to go home  but he was so excited to see Sam and Jess  because we hang out a bunch  and Sam's parents and stuff  he knows the people  but he goes, no, Roro  he doesn't like Roro  oh, Roro, what are you doing? 
[02:57:00]  he was completely bummed  he did enjoy my rain dance  he did?  yeah, and you fucking humored him  that's funny  that is really fucking funny  Klump Soty Kennedy's upset  why?  because he thinks my statement is admission that I don't like him  but I didn't say I invited everybody who I like  I said everybody who I invited I like  why didn't Kennedy get the big invite?  he's always gone by  oh boy, why didn't Kennedy get the big invite?  knowing that  he most likely wouldn't have gone  oh no 
[02:57:30]  that's not what you said  so don't try to spin it  they could replay the tape  oh  I didn't say I invited everybody I like  yes you did  alright, replay the tape  Kenny  you don't think Sam likes you?  even though you guys fool around a lot  no, it's obvious now  and now I'm a sucker for giving him such a big wedding gift too  oh  shit  why wouldn't you invite Kenny?  he's actually fun in social situations  even if it was a phony, empty invite  he was a blasted  like the Iraq one  he went to Iraq 
[02:58:00]  he actually went to Iraq's party  oh you did?  yeah  we had fun there, right?  Kenny?  yeah  yeah  I was socializing with everybody  you was socializing  yeah  I don't know, I mean  Kenny makes the medium list  but he doesn't make the short list  he's just jealous because his wife digs me  like what is it?  motivation  oh, you know what  he makes the medium list  not the short list  oh  it was a short list party 
[02:58:30]  but you guys kind of like joke all the time in the hallways  that's alright  not anymore  oh man  and you know he means that  not anymore  oh yeah, he means it  all the people that bad mouth him  on my Facebook page  I always ignored  and I stick up for him  not anymore  oh  well  see that's what happens  when people draw first blood  wait, wait, wait, wait  what's your Facebook page?  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook  oh, that one  alright  over 8,000 people like me  8,000 strong  yeah  8,000 people that would invite you to their party 
[02:59:00]  of course Iraq wants to  I'm one of them  so not 8,000  Iraq just whispered to me and said  I got the audio, Kenny's right  oh, shit  so now Iraq is throwing Sam under the bus  let's hear the audio  let's hear it  yeah  but you didn't do anything to Sam  and you were still invited  and I only invited people I like  like I didn't invite anybody that I wouldn't hang out with  did you hear that?  yeah  I only invited people I like  not I invited everyone I like  I only invited people I like  don't try to spin it, stupid  you're wrong again  no, no, stupid  you're wrong  hold on 
[02:59:30]  let me see  let me see  there's a lot going on here  because Sam doesn't like being wrong  I only invited people I like  implies that the list of the people I invited  I like them all  not the list of the people I like  were all invited  sorry  you have the party list  Iraq, you're wrong  you threw me under the bus  you were completely incorrect  no  but grammar's never been your strong suit anyway  but  hold on  now everyone has  put it on me under the bus  hold on  no, no, no, no  I got another part to this 
[03:00:00]  we're all in a sub  we're all in a sub-genre  oh do I love this  we're in a sub-genre  you're work friends  right  I only invite the people that I like  now that  can be translated like  I like a thousand people  I can't even have a thousand people  at my family's barbecue  but  I only invite the people I like  in the sub-genre of radio  I said I only invited people I like  not I only invited people  I like  now this is very important  the wording on this  has to be exact  alright, let's hear it again 
[03:00:30]  because I'm gonna argue  the sub-genre  he would have to be included  in the radio people  that he invited already  no, I understand  what Sam's saying here  and I  although  let me tell you something  Sam Skates  Kenny, you know  I love and respect you  right?  do you know that, Kenny?  no, you could take sides  no, no, no  no sides  I'm just saying  as an outside observer  without taking any sides  either way  I think  Sam might have this one  I think 
[03:01:00]  let me hear the clip again  I think  leaves an avenue of escape  to justify you being wrong  that's not a strong  well, you know why?  because I'm not done  I haven't drawn a conclusion yet  let me  let me hear the clip again  but you also gotta assume  if you're  Club Soda Kenny  and you hear that  you would go  holy fuck  he doesn't like me  it's obvious  everybody's going  oh shit  careful Ant  don't do it Ant  careful  let's hear it again  you rock  but you didn't do anything  Sam and you were still invited 
[03:01:30]  I only invited people I like  I didn't invite anybody  that I wouldn't hang out with  I only invited people I like  and I wouldn't invite anyone  I don't hang out with  hold on  you don't hang out with Kenny?  I only invited people I like  it doesn't mean  that everyone I like  I invited  no, don't read into it  just go by exactly  what was said  I only invited people  I like  period  don't read into it 
[03:02:00]  okay, that does mean  that he  he didn't invite anyone  he doesn't like  right  but it does not mean  everybody that he liked  it does not mean  that I invited everybody I like  by any stretch of the imagination  there's  there's three lists  there's people I like  there's people I don't like  there's people who are invited  the people who are invited  come off the list  of people I like  but it's not the complete list  read the sentence  yeah  I only invited people I like  but what about  the well-regulated 
[03:02:30]  militia part  let's go to Iraq on this  Iraq  Iraq comment  Iraq  how do you read this  I can see what Kenny's saying  I only invited the people  I only invited people  that I like  no, I only invited people I like  no, I only invited people I like  I wouldn't invite people  I wouldn't hang out with  or something  I only invited people I like  I got a lawyer on the phone  that doesn't mean  it doesn't mean  that I invited all the people I like  that's true  I got a lawyer on the phone  alright, let's talk to a lawyer 
[03:03:00]  hey, Jared  Matt in Jersey  hey, boys  hey, listen  by putting only  in front of what he said  that modifies the phrase  so when he says  I only invited people I like  that implies that  he didn't invite anybody  that he doesn't like  correct  so when you put that  second part of the sentence  that only reinforces  when he says  I didn't invite anybody  that I wouldn't hang out with  that goes with only  so if he said  I invited  if he said  I invited people I like  he might have an argument  but when he put only in there  I only invited 
[03:03:30]  right, because that's limiting  the scope of people  that he would have invited  correct  it's limiting the scope  to the people who I like  however  he's calling you out, Sam  I know  okay  but it is  it's all about that second part  of the statement  it's modifying it  to the extent  that it only  takes people  from the list  of people I like  however  it doesn't include  the whole list  wow  no, it's not  has Kenny ever been invited  as one of the people you like?  I don't  I mean  I don't have very many parties  yeah, he was at my wedding 
[03:04:00]  that's a big deal  yeah  who didn't call  that I got invited?  oh  holy shit  I would think  it would be a no-brainer  that Kenny would be  at your wedding, right?  yeah  now you're calling  Kenny a no-brainer  no, no, no  wow  that was never in question  Kenny's a lot of fun  at parties  absolutely  he really is  he has the life of the party  remember the lampshade  he put on his head  and he started dancing  crazy  maniac  I would think it would be  you know  yeah, that's why he was  at the wedding  exactly 
[03:04:30]  I only invited people I like  does not imply  that everyone that Sam likes  was invited  that's all I'm saying  that's all I'm saying  people I would hang out with  that doesn't matter  it is that being exclusive  meaning you would not  hang out with Kenny  who's a worker  no, it doesn't mean that at all  do you know what  a huge list it would be  if it said  everybody I like  I'm invited  and then I said  Sam likes a lot of people  I said I didn't invite  people I wouldn't hang out with  was Eastside Dave there?  no  see, you like him  I just heard about him this weekend  did you invite Eastside Dave?  no  see 
[03:05:00]  I love Eastside Dave  Kenny, you're losing the argument  no mashup?  he likes you  I love the mashups  people  I love the mashups  you love them  not one of them was invited  see, what happened?  actions speak louder than words  GH  he didn't invite me  aww  aww  Kenny's feelings are hurt  that is  yeah, I'm not mad  I'm just hurt  on a personal level  yes, you did fuck  Kenny over  he is a lovable guy  and he's fun at parties  but technically  I know how to bring it  but he tried to get me  on this statement  I don't mind him being upset  by not getting invited  but don't  don't try to get me 
[03:05:30]  on this statement  don't be a sore loser  every time  neither  well, I'm not the loser  I was at the party  oh, see now you're  rubbing it in  yikes, I guess I was a loser  I missed this  but you got the invite  I am so glad  I don't go to any of these parties  yes, it looks like  nothing but trouble  what about E-Rock  E-Rock, you were ready  to just sell Sam out  when you heard the clip  it did sound like he said  that I invite people  that I like  but I did invite people 
[03:06:00]  that I like  but that's not  isn't every party  you're pretty much  inviting people you like  of course  regardless of the size  of the invitation list  did you invite Sal?  nope  well  don't like Sal either  won't tell you  which list he's on  keep him guessing  marionette head  Kenny, did you get rid  of that spot by the way?  it's all over my suit  what happened?  well Kenny  come in your pants  you shoot some banana juice  I had to make a duty 
[03:06:30]  this morning  Kenny  wait  sometimes when I  I come down  you know Kenny picks me up  because he's on his way in  to be totally honest with you  that's what that really is about  so sometimes when I get down  into my lobby  Kenny's not in his car  and one of my  doormen have to go  he's in the bathroom  so Kenny's taking his  morning duty  he comes walking out  and then I follow him  out of the building  yeah  he's got a huge  whitish  bordering on yellowish  oh no  huge spot 
[03:07:00]  right where your asshole  would be in his pants  oh no  how did that happen?  and I had to  awkwardly tell him  uh  I don't know why  I was looking at your asshole  but  there's a spot there  what was it?  I don't know what it was  it was either  anthrax or baby powder  all over the fucking  but the coloring on it  makes me think  there was more than  baby powder going on  turn around  is it gone?  it's all the way over  he just bent over  it's gone 
[03:07:30]  did you have to take  your pants off  in the bathroom  and clean them up?  no but I saw  it's like on the  cuffs of my pants  then it was everywhere  because then I'm like  what the fuck  happened to you  maybe it's like  Ajax cleanser  or something  spread around the place  Ajax  you could smell the  yeah  but how did it get on  your pants  where your asshole is?  because it was on  the toilet seat  on the floor  it was like  all over the place  so maybe someone's  in the middle of  cleaning the bathroom  when I backed 
[03:08:00]  that ass up  and mounted  the toilet  yeah  my black pants  probably like  rubbed  against everything  you don't spread  mud in public  bathrooms  like some of  these animals  do you?  no I go  when I go  but you don't  spread it all  over the place  oh no I go  yeah and I flush  yeah  you're a human being  yeah  I can't stand that  when they fucking  it looks like  they just flung  shit against the  walls  but I made  juice yesterday  so  yeah  I had to go 
[03:08:30]  oh yeah  he's trying to  drink juice  now  oh you're juicing  yeah but it's  such a pain in the ass  to make it  and you gotta clean  the fuck  it really is  juicers are a pain  he has to clean  it's not worth it  go to a juice store  you gotta have one  in your town  there is  a lot easier  a little expensive  I know but I made it  like for the whole  week now  ah then  the vegetables  separate  no I shake it up  what's in your  vegetable juice  orange  that's a fruit  pineapple 
[03:09:00]  that's a fruit  it's fruit  carrot  which is very sweet  apple  I don't know  the fruit  and beets  no greens  no greens  not good  no then I'd really  be fucking  shitting all over  the place  throw a little  spinach in there  no no  you put a pound  of spinach in  and you get  you get  an eyedrop  of fucking juice  that's the beauty  of it  that's all your  vegetables  in the spinach  no  like kale  I tried 
[03:09:30]  kale's  good for you  you rock  so Sam  or Kenny  who's right  and then we move  on  you rock  just take yourself  outside of it  and study the  sentence  yeah  it's very obvious  if I had said  I only invited  the people I like  that would imply  that only the  people I like  were invited  is that what  they taught you  at Syracuse  saying I only  invited people I  like  opens it up  based on that 
[03:10:00]  sentence  does it mean  Sam  would have been  obligated to  invite every  person he likes  to the party  oh you just  fucking  that's the  question  that's Sam's  case  exactly  all I know  is Sam's  attorney  with the two  eyes  in the sentence  proves how  self-centered  alright that  I give you  definitely you win  that one  alright let's go  to the jury  Iraq  well the second  part says I  didn't invite  anybody I  wouldn't hang  out with  yeah and that 
[03:10:30]  doesn't imply that  everybody who  wasn't invited  would not with  somebody I  wouldn't hang  out with  implications  don't read  into it  both sentences  do not have  absolutes  I'm sorry  doesn't seem that  way to me  Iraq  because that  would that  would mean that  I only hang  out with five  people  well you should  you should only  hang out with  the same five  people you always  hang out with  you're not a  likable person  no  Iraq  I see what 
[03:11:00]  you're saying  but I can also  understand why  Kenny would be  upset by that  we're not  understanding why  and upset  emotions aren't  here we're  talking facts  yeah  it does seem  like it says  I don't like  or what's the  facts  this statement  does not oblige  Sam to invite  everyone he likes  this isn't an  emotional question  there's nothing in  that statement  that says that  Sam should have  invited everyone  he likes  or not say  have said that  statement  logically  not emotionally 
[03:11:30]  right  well we're  waiting  comment  Iraq  he's not  sure  geez  Iraq  it's up to  him  it's like  the virus  is a jury  yeah  just a verdict  one verdict  Iraq  oh boy  a jury of  your queers  Iraq 
[03:12:00]  it  it  it  there's no  weighing  it's just  what the  sentence says  oh  I mean  there's  Iraq  I like  coke logic  I didn't  invite him  right  well  plenty of  people you  like  he seemed  fine  I invited  Iraq  Dr. Steve  was cool  you like  coke logic  so much  when's the  last time  you spoke  to him  the other  day  yeah 
[03:12:30]  do you call  him when  you're sad  and blue  do you know  his favorite  color  blue  they needed  the money  Kenny I've  known you a long  time I don't  know your  favorite color  what color  is it  you gotta  guess  I'm gonna  go blue  no  of course  not  it's gotta  be a  shitty  color  mauve  I enjoy  a good  mauve  color  beige 
[03:13:00]  um  purple  negative  yellow  do you  hear  something  oh  nah  Kenny's  a red  guy  that's  danger  oh is  it  yeah  he's a  safe  color  green  are you  bingo  by the way  Iraq said  I'm gonna  let Kenny  off  sorry  but I'm  gonna let  Kenny  off the  hook  what does  that mean  that's not  what I said 
[03:13:30]  what'd you  say  I said  sorry  Kenny  but I  think  Sam's  gonna  slide  on this  I  understand  why  Kenny's  upset  but  there's  no  absolute  so I  think  Sam  gets  a  technically  yes  that's  a  grammatic  question  now  you're  also  on  Kenny's  shit  list  yep  Eric's  good  people  what does  that mean  he's  alright  alright  are we  done  here  I  hope  so  hope 
[03:14:00]  everybody's  had their  grammar  lesson for  the day  too  next  time  don't  call  a  phrase  into  question  Kenny  you came  in here  and called  that  phrase  into  question  look  Sam  you did  skate  but the  fact  remains  you  don't  like  Kenny  that's  that's  neither  that's  not  been  established  well  why  wouldn't  you  say  that's  not  true  what's  been  established  is  the  nature  of the  sentence  exactly  he didn't  tonight  I didn't  establish  whether I  like him  or not  why  wouldn't  you  I was  waiting  to see  how this  conversation  went  he doesn't  like you  no  that's  obvious  but he 
[03:14:30]  lucked out  on the way  he put  his sentence  no luck  another great  hold on  let's see how  the crew  is working  with each  other  segment  John Grisham  is checking  John Grisham  New Orleans  the author  Jason is a  lawyer  what's up  Jason  I completely  disagree  with the  attorney  from New  Jersey  let me  tell you  why  he's  right  the  use  of  the  word  only  is  important  however  the  placement  of  the  word  only  is  equally  important  he said  I only  invited  people  that I 
[03:15:00]  like  he didn't  say  I  invited  the  only  people  that I  like  therefore  he took  the  invitees  from a  greater  list  of people  that he  liked  it doesn't  mean  he doesn't  like  Kenny  I think  he's a  dick  for not  inviting  Kenny  but  it doesn't  mean  that he  does not  like  Kenny  exactly  thank you  you're  very  welcome  wait  so what  happened  there  I don't  know  lawyer  speak  I think  we're not  allowed  to do  a bit  probably  what that  meant  we'll break  finish up  the show 
[03:15:30]  next  welcome  back to  Yentexplorers  with Marge  and Gertrude  let's join  the ladies  as they head  down to the  deepest  darkest  parts  of the  ocean  to explore  the  Titanic  boy  this elevator  sure the  heck  is taking  quite a  long  time  I hope  no one  pushes  all the  buttons  on the  way  back  up  oh  stopping  at  every  depth  oh I  know  yeah this  is like  going up  into the  plane but  going down  into the  ocean  where's the  clouds  and stuff

[03:17:30]  people have  around this  motherfucker  it's just  so much  fun  yeah  some  asshole's  gonna sing  god bless  america  911 times  in honor  of 9-11  anniversary  all right  way to make  it about  yourself  relax  why is he  doing that  exactly  what is the  purpose besides  going hey  look at me  that's a me  me  me  unless he  lost people  and stuff  then I look  like an  it's still  me me  me  you think  yeah  me me  me me  I can't  believe it's  11 years  tomorrow  11 years  tomorrow 
[03:18:00]  9-11  wow  yeah  that's  fucked up  what do  we do  for the  11 years  nothing  there's no  big lights  there's no  I think  they're  I saw some  lights this  weekend  what was that  I didn't  see the  lights  were they  maybe a  grand opening  or something  I saw  lights coming  out of the  buildings  I don't  know  I know  they're going  to have  some kind  memorial  they do  that every  year  but I  think  the 10  year was  the big  one last  year  does Obama  come for  the 11th  no  11th  now  it's just  really  in an 
[03:18:30]  election  year  no  no  no  this is  something we  talked about  many years  ago  that it  would slowly  just fade  out  just turns  into  whatever  whatever  what they  do at  other places  there are  people  that don't  even have  an  let's say  an adult  recollection  of 9-11  like they  have a  recollection  of something  you know  when you  were a  kid  and something  happened  and it was  like yeah  I remember  but nah  and they're  adults now  but they  don't have  an adult  recollection 
[03:19:00]  of 9-11  it's so  weird  I'm going  to bring it  in tomorrow  because I  didn't realize  we were going  to talk about  this  this is an  actual formula  of what  year  you get  to where  more than  half the  people alive  don't have a  recollection of  that event  but it's an  actual formula  oh it is  yeah  and then  they'll tell  you like  by the  year  whatever  more people  will not  have an  actual  recollection  of 9-11  than do  that are  alive  they won't  remember  living through 
[03:19:30]  it  they'll know  about it  because it's  history  and some  of the  things  it was  kind of  creepy  I didn't  realize we  were going  down this  road  I'll bring  it to the  show  tomorrow  but it's a  whole fucking  formula  and then  they do  like  you know  like  the JFK  assassination  by the  year  I don't  remember  what year  they said  but let's  say  1990  more people  don't have  a recollection  of living  through that  than do  something like  that  yeah  but I'll  have actual  facts tomorrow  damn  isn't that  fucked up  yeah  unless someone  has a link  to that  shit right 
[03:20:00]  now  because we've  got a  couple  minutes  left  9-11  I guess  people are  a little  pissed  off too  because  the memorial  down there  is really  nice and  everything  and people  are spilling  coffee on  the fucking  plaques  of course  just a bunch  of  how much  is it  going to  cost  they had  that number  over the  weekend  how much  it's going  to cost  a year  to maintain  that thing  and the number  was  wow  pretty fucking  staggering  I couldn't  believe it  yeah  it's either  6 million  or 60 million  it's a lot 
[03:20:30]  yeah  6 million  or 60  I'm not even  joking  or 6 billion  there was a  6 in there  either one  to me was like  that's a lot  of money  yeah  and what  the TV  coverage  the reading  of the  names  are we still  reading  the reading  of the  names  tomorrow  when do  they stop  doing that  well that's  that's  that's  the question  that's the  big moment  I think it's  local though  like the  nationals will  pick it up  here and there  but the local  feed I think  is channel 5  but eventually the  local news channels  are going to have to  bet on that too  which one's going to  be the first to  go look 
[03:21:00]  there's nothing  else we could  do here  we all know  that they  completely sucked  and it's horrendous  and all that  but 60 million  a year  60 million  for the upkeep  of the memorial  down there  probably a lot  of security  too  you know that  probably is a lot  of security  why security  well they probably  don't want anyone  messing with it  yeah  any of them  muslims coming in  and fucking with it  yeah  why is the guy  doing god bless  america 911  times  me  where were you 
[03:21:30]  oh and for  music fans  is les zeppelin  going to put out  another album  how is that  possible  on their facebook  page I guess  they wrote  five  so everyone's  speculating that  means they're  putting out a new  album or something  like that  really  oh boy  do we want to  hear zeppelin  at this point  no  robert plant  can't sing  he can't sing  that type of  music anymore  he does those  you know  honey dripper type  songs and that's  fine  they're kind of  nice  but uh 
[03:22:00]  he can't sing  zeppelin anymore  no  you don't want to  hear any of that  shit  i'm surprised  the fucking stones  just are still  i was hearing about  the stones yesterday  and how they're  gonna be putting out  an album and touring  and just signed a  bunch of fucking  signed on with  what espn for  yeah  some kind of shit  and yeah  and it's like  2012  it's their 50th  anniversary  you start thinking  like you know  did anybody think  in 2012  the rolling stones  would still be 
[03:22:30]  doing anything  no they gotta be  uh  they gotta be at  least 70 at this  point right  we're very close  to it  crazy  and they're gonna  do a whole world  tour  yeah  playing two dates  in brooklyn  in november  that's what it is  brooklyn's becoming  like that place to  fucking play if you're  playing limited shows  huh  they got the new  arena  yeah  i guess dylan's  doing that too  chavis what do we  know on zeppelin  it's a countdown  oh so there's a  countdown on their  site for what  i don't know  touring  yesterday they  posted four  i heard they

[03:25:00]  right not too many  in some games in in some  other games they did  yeah the embarrassing  part though she uh there  was a penalty flag and  she ripped her fucking  tampon out and threw it  i didn't read that it  was terrible yeah yeah i  saw that are you making  so terrible you're making  fun of my tweet what is  that a did you tweet that  you're making fun of my  tweet no i was just  thinking it was kind of  funny oh look at that  oh you tweeted that shit  you're making fun of my  tweet no i swear i swear i  just thought of it i think  that was a backhanded  fucking fuck you no i think 
[03:25:30]  so i had no clue yes you  did honestly i had no  clue let me see i thought  i wrote okay let's see  then of course that's  oh yeah where is it  shit what he wrote was  uh oh because i bang had  the story so i was helping  out the uh the i bang on  twitter they wrote first  female ref makes nfl  history i wrote was awkward  when she threw tampon on a  field instead of the flag  right that figures  you're making fun of me  no i really i really was 
[03:26:00]  just like no he was  taking a shot oh man  she looked pretty hot  she know who she looked  like she looked like uh  one of the broads from  that movie with uh  fucking uh akroyd and  candy uh the fucking uh  with bill murray the army  movie oh stripes oh  oh well not that wow  she does not even look  good there no that's a  bad picture find some  other pictures see if  that's a bad picture  remember though when in  stripes they had the hair  up under the hats and  stuff yeah all right  all right she looks a  little dikey all right 
[03:26:30]  maybe she looked good  from the like she kind  of looked good in a few  pictures i saw but now  the ones we're looking  at nah like away from  hey how weird bad we  didn't really talk about  football that much because  it's still revving up but  how weird was it to see  peyton manning in that  orange uniform travis i  know you like it was a  little weird strange when  that happens right when  you're used to one guy  we've done this bit a  million times one guy  when you're so used to  seeing him in that  uniform and then he plays  in a drastic uh yeah he  played well though yeah  he did all right yeah  won the game 400 
[03:27:00]  touchdown 401 in one  game yep yep holy  shit you missed a hell  of a game sam yeah  the score was 28 28  hundred and forty two  to seven oh they  killed him yeah you're  assuming they didn't  try for any two-point  conversions did i do the  math correctly okay  because i was trying i  was trying to figure out  some sixes and sevens  in there and common  yeah whatever shut up  shut up did your team  win travis they 
[03:27:30]  play tonight raven's  bangles two monday  night games huh two  monday night games that's  they like to do that on  week one how do you pay  attention to the orioles  also well the orioles have  an off night today yeah  but i mean with all this  going yesterday yesterday  was very weird my team is  usually out of playoff  contention and i'm very  looking forward to  football complete  opposite now yesterday  i watched i watched the orioles  game and i and i kept my  eye on the football yeah  the orioles are still in  it stealing wins from the  yankees well i know  fucking shit would it be a 
[03:28:00]  lot easier as soon as  football starts whoever has  the best record in baseball  wins it all they just  know world series so smart  yeah just say all right  look you have the best  record  it'd be a lot of pressure  to make sure you have the  best record before football  starts  yeah because you know how  many people how many  people check out of  baseball so it's football  starts right i i do i  mean if if the orioles  weren't in it this year i'm  i'm done the only ones not  checking out is if their  team's in it but everyone  else that might check out  some of these games maybe  that's why they added the  extra wild card so that  more people would still be  interested in baseball 
[03:28:30]  162 games in this day and  age really that's a lot of  games but it's baseball  it's kind of there it's  omnipresent and you know  what's great now when you  can watch it on the ipad i  can still watch television  and i got my ipad just  sitting next to you got  the game right there that  is pretty goddamn handy  perfect screen to watch  baseball game right up  close it's great yeah  yeah that ipad is the  best attention i have so  many fucking computers in  my house now i just had to  get another one yesterday

[03:45:00]  chicken fingers were  delicious  and you liked  everything  and they'll be  king goes  how are the  chicken fingers  good  he goes  whoo where  are they  i ate them  you ate all  of them  i ate that  plate that  they know that  was for him  well i mean i  guess it was an  appetizer it was  for all the  guests though  if they're yapping  i'm hungry  right that's  going you don't  spend the when  you get to a  party you don't  spend the beginning  uh yapping  drinking  you spend it  drinking and  eating and then  once the food is  done you'll get  to your socializing  yeah then your  dad goes have a  beer all right i 
[03:45:30]  don't be rude  so it starts  pouring rain and  we're undercover so  everything's fine but  it starts pouring rain  and everybody like i  said just chilling  out before you were  at this party we were  chilling out were we  not yeah it was a  great time but roland  wasn't chilling out  it starts pouring rain  and roland decides just  because everybody's  gonna get such a kick  out of it he's gonna  leave the patio area  that's covered and just  start running around in  the backyard in the  pouring rain you got  soaked yeah why i 
[03:46:00]  don't know it's like  when i get drunk either  fat in her water i go  to you love getting wet  that's like your  goof you just get  yourself soaking wet  yeah were you  embarrassed to roll in  at first i was  embarrassed for you  you are that was  your family my  parents were probably  like what what is  this i don't understand  because it wasn't even  like it wasn't crazy at  all and then every  try goes hey way to  eat that he said you  show this way i go  yeah for pussy you  started yelling out  pussy a lot of weird 
[03:46:30]  obscenities yeah and i  mean by that time opi's  two-year-old was there  my parents are sitting  there yeah where you're  in the backyard he's  from the kid like new  york he probably heard  worse than you're in  the backyard that i grew  up in yeah just a  little respect for the  location you know yeah  you'd think you'd kind  of get a feel of what  the vibe was before you  started going in yeah  your parents seem to  run roll with the  punches though yeah but  you generally you kind  of want to get a gauge on  that before you find out 
[03:47:00]  like you could have just  as easily found out that  my parents weren't  rolling with the punches  well i think he would  probably know that you  know being as though  they've called into the  show and yeah you know  their involvement with you  know what you've done  why push the envelope  though is a question i  mean you were embarrassed  you you thought his  behavior was embarrassing  slightly but it's also  funny i mean your  girlfriend get annoyed  when the two of you are  together and she's  hanging out with you  she got pissed  jess told me yeah we're  jess told me that first  of all she had enough  jess loves your  girlfriend that's cool  yeah and she loves  jess they could become 
[03:47:30]  great friends but jess  told me after she got  back from driving you to  the train station that  your girlfriend had had  enough of the two of you  oh she did and then at  one point jess had to  tell you guys okay we  especially jess said  roland she had to turn  around whoa okay it's  fair is it fair i mean  is she lying no she's  no she's not lying she  had to turn around and  say all right that's  gonna be enough and  and your girlfriend  responded by saying  finally that that is 
[03:48:00]  true that's very very  true but it's just like  you know hey look we're  here to have fun yeah  you know yolo you're  hanging with my friends  like this is how we have  fun you know like do you  ever like because i've been  in this situation where  because i've i love it  you know i love it yeah  you know i love getting  rolling all around you  encourage it absolutely  you encourage the  water i love when  roland starts deciding  it's time to get goofy  and to go run in the  rain or pour bottles of  water on himself i'm the  guy who's saying yeah  let's get him some more  water let's get him  let's get him soaking 
[03:48:30]  wet um but i've been in  situations where i'm  hanging out with roland  and jess is like annoyed  with my behavior because  she doesn't want to deal  with drunken roland making  a fool of himself and  everyone around us just  making a scene roland makes  a scene huge scene and  girls don't like it when  guys make a scene like  that well they think it's  funny for a little bit  yeah but then the point  that we would go to or  he you know he would go  to it's just too much  it's kind of it's like  his girlfriend and then  uh they're her friend  when the way i do the  aids chant the horror look 
[03:49:00]  on people was hilarious  the horror look that they  went oh my god what he  did an aids chant on the  subway yeah well we were  goofing around we were we  were like what did your  girlfriend think of that  the aids chant yeah uh well  she was you know she was  drinking we were in like  madonna mode so it was  okay and it was only the  subway ride was only a  couple stops so she knew  it was going to end at a  certain point like she  would have to she would be  able to get off and get  away from these people  we were screaming like  and we're like what's up  bro and we're like i'm  about to get sick bro and  he was like you know we're 
[03:49:30]  just going back and forth  you know just top of our  lungs top of our lungs  just trying to piss off  everybody it's kind of  funny because that kind of  started as a parody of you  troy right like the bro  thing well that was also  that was a goof in itself  right because you started  doing it as a goof but  then people started  parodying you doing it  and roland was parodying  you with you while you  were also doing the  parody it's because it's  it's got it's gotten a  life of its own  completely and the subway  was so packed i mean we're  like wall to wall of  people just obnoxious 
[03:50:00]  has has your girlfriend  ever been like troy you  were really annoying  tonight no my my girl's  like she's punk rock dude  she's like yeah but she  was annoyed well yeah she  was she was it right  i mean like enough can  you tell when when she  gets annoyed when the  three of you are hanging  out i didn't before until  back of the car i go oh  and in our defense she  has the the mexican look  yeah all women have  their mexican it's called  picante you're like oh  shit yeah that's when we  all go and in our defense 
[03:50:30]  um she did have to work  so she was cranky that  she had to work and she  is menstruating so so now  is she cool with you kind  of going in there is  about troy and this cake  antics announcing to the  world was she embarrassed  that you did i mean you  made that scene at the  party right you did my  dad was a man of a  certain age he's just  trying to be a polite  gentleman and throw a  party that we can all  enjoy and you know time  everything out properly  right and you got troy  over here who's this  young guy showing up  with all his tattoos  blazing and his cool 
[03:51:00]  dude hair and his dj  attitude what's up bro  and my dad is walking  out of the house and  troy loudly starts talking  to me because he sees my  dad there and he loudly  starts saying you know  because we got to go  soon and then he tells  your dad and then my dad  comes over and he goes  are they going and i told  my dad i said yeah they're  gonna go uh but we're  gonna do dessert after  they leave because that's  the polite thing to do  right for the whole party  and then troy said yeah i 
[03:51:30]  mean i would have loved  to have some cake it's a  little ridiculous with your  quote well i mean don't  you think that i've come  all that way you weren't  doing me any favors oh  but i mean i came out to  your birthday party i wanted  to show respect i wanted  to say you didn't show  any respect i think i did  i showed up you didn't  it's more than some other  people could say you're  talking about eric well  you know and i think i  jess is a bit annoying  because i messed up the  train right going oh yeah  and roland i was hung  over as hell that's not  an excuse yeah it is 
[03:52:00]  westchester is a big county  that's where i live west  chester new york and  it's a county which  means it's made up of  several cities okay so  my parents live in one  city in westchester i live  in another city in west  chester i was texting  roland on friday going  yeah my parents live near  me it's easy just take  the train out from the  city and we'll come pick  you up because it is  easy the trains are real  easy to get to west  chester um and if you  got somebody picking you  up it's nothing so i  didn't hear from roland  or troy all day on 
[03:52:30]  saturday and i was like  oh maybe they're not  gonna come because i  told him if you have  something better to do  i'm not gonna be  offended it's no big  deal it's whatever and  so i texted troy at like  four and i was like hey  you know we're gonna  kind of start things in  like an hour if you need  directions or help  getting here just let me  know unless you found  something else that's  cool too and troy goes  roland didn't text you  and i go no and he  goes we're on a train we  got on a train five  minutes ago i go what  we're in route and i  immediately i looked at 
[03:53:00]  jess we're already at  my parents house and  i go they're already  on a train and jess  goes what and i knew  that i had never told  roland even what city  my parents lived in i  didn't tell him where  it was how could he put  you on a train and so i  was like roland got him  on a train to go to  where i live which is  25 minutes away from my  parents house by that  so i started texting you  and you're like i'm  sorry and i go you know  it's roland's fault and  he goes yeah and so  jess had to leave she 
[03:53:30]  was inconvenienced to  go pick you guys up  where we had just come  from by my house because  roland why wouldn't you  text me before you left  and say hey where should  i go to where i'm all i  thought about is get  coffee get coffee get  coffee i was so hung  over then then think  logically think logically  i want everybody listening  to this to think logically  because troy on more than  one occasion has brought  up times are tough and  finances uh when you  were talking about going 
[03:54:00]  to eric's house you know  you talked about how  much money the train ride  would be and how you  didn't want to spend that  much money yeah so he  paid i'm not paying  anybody's train tickets  troy and roland and  troy's girlfriend obviously  paid their own train  ticket to get to  westchester all good as  they should you know as  as would as manners would  dictate um but roland  decided to tell troy and  his girlfriend that  obviously if you're going  to westchester from new  york city on a commuter 
[03:54:30]  train that's what it was  it's a train that's  designed for people going  to and from work that  saturday afternoon at  3 55 p.m would obviously  be a peak train he said  it's still if you have to  get your tickets before  four it's still rolling  rolling i don't know  peak refers to the  maximum amount of people  on the train oh that's  why it's peak it's the  most you don't travel well  so they should take that  into consideration you  make assumptions that are  usually they can read you 
[03:55:00]  usually you make assumptions  that are almost always  wrong and then present them  as facts they can read but  they didn't say what the  times were i thought you  had no because you've  written this train a bunch  of times i always pay  peak listen i mean paying  peak i guess is the safe  bet because then you don't  get stuck but for future  reference if it's not a  time when most people were  going to what would be  going to work probably not  a peak train well now we  know now you know you did  you learned some lessons  and i did text you you  texted me what you texted 
[03:55:30]  me after you got to the  party and then acted like  i had just gotten the text  late that way that didn't  count yeah and then  rolling got drunk he's  running out in the rain he  starts laughing at my dog  who by the way can't see  because he's a dog of a  certain age at this point  or here right he's lost his  sense of hearing and sight  right and as roland is  laughing at the dog for  being blind roland turns  around and walks face  first into a glass door  you saw that right  yeah i sure did face  first into the door see  i think your parents are  they they they understand 
[03:56:00]  the humor of roland i  don't think your uh in-laws  found much humor in  jess's parents were there  yeah you don't think  they thought roland was  funny i don't i don't  think they thought anything  was funny really yeah i  don't think they thought  anything we were doing  was funny enough but i i  do got to say though your  mother-in-law is hot i  appreciate your the  comment and that's a  i'm sure she'll appreciate  that that's a good look  because you always want to  look at a girl's mother to  see what the girl's gonna  look like how's your  girlfriend's mom looking  she's cute they're they  look completely different 
[03:56:30]  okay like my girlfriend's  tall she's you know five  almost five eleven maybe  she's got a very handsome  dad then who knows yeah  but your mom's cookies were  delicious mom's cookies  were delicious and you  think jess's mom is  banging for an older lady  yeah she looks pretty good  okay but you don't think  she well you gotta  understand that you guys  are very abrasive for a  first impression like  that's a lot to take in  when you just see some  weird a little bit  overweight guy in jets  warm-up shirt a little  okay you look fair enough 
[03:57:00]  yeah and a rough week and  you're not doing yourself  any favors yeah when you  see a guy but thank you  for a little a little  overweight and he looks to  be hispanic but you can't  understand a word he's  saying in any language  right he's wearing a jets  warm-up uniform and he's  running around in the  backyard by himself in the  rain like you have to  understand like not the  first reaction from a lot  of people are gonna be  like what's that guy's  deal like what is all  this she also knows what  you do for a living and 
[03:57:30]  then he starts screaming  out profanities and  references to Hitler  what's that are  but pussies he kept  saying pussy she's you  know she's a Jewish woman  yeah I got friends in  school huh I got friends  who are Jewish it's all  good or do you have the  pass you have the pass  yeah my buddy David  like my buddy David  Stern said you have the  pass like who kid gave  me my n-word yeah my  buddy David Stern goes  you have the you have  the we grew up together  references to Hitler  pass with Jewish people  Hitler jokes are okay  yeah he said you have  the pass but you don't 
[03:58:00]  think you know you  think was it more like I  don't like this or this  is bizarre with who my  in-laws uh both oh yeah  this is bizarre and I'm  being made to feel  uncomfortable because  someone goes I'm oh the  car ride's not good  because Jess's mom went  with Jess oh yeah and  it's one thing to have  that kind of energy at a  party but it's a total  other thing to have that  in such close quarters  yeah you could tell she  was she was annoyed yeah  in that car ride  100% with Jess was  was she annoyed too  Jess Jess is I think 
[03:58:30]  Jess was annoyed that  her mom was annoyed that  we got her annoyed that  now Jess is annoyed  Jess seems annoyed but  Jess has a nice way of  playing off that she's  annoyed where you can  tell she's annoyed but  she's still being cool  right because she likes  you guys she likes and  she understands that look  we're just goofing  around but she probably  was more annoyed if she  could tell her mom was  annoyed yeah like you  don't want you don't want  people around annoying  your mom because she  like if I was like if I  showed up at your house  and your mom was like  come on you at one point  would probably pull me 
[03:59:00]  aside and be like dude I  think it's funny but come  on bro right my mom is  starting to get a little  annoyed yeah she's getting  a little pissed yeah just  go crazy yeah but you  wouldn't mind yeah fuck  yeah it's hilarious you  like it I don't think I  overstepped any boundaries  at your house yeah I  mean I would say you  didn't until the cake you  asked my dad to you  guilted my father into  bringing dessert out  earlier so let me ask you  before we left you said  the top three worst  person okay what I was  doing was I told your  girlfriend with all three  of you there that if I 
[03:59:30]  were to only invite one  of you back to the party  based on manners it would  obviously be your  girlfriend by yourself  and you can understand  that I know to some  degree to all degrees  but we had fun I mean  don't you think that we  added a lot of spice to  the party yeah but to  some people didn't like  that though I mean that's  not our fault I mean what  you do for a living sorry  you know these are your  co-workers I can't  entertain everybody with  the same demo in terms of  manners and politeness  though you know you  weren't polite I was  polite in the beginning  but not at the end well 
[04:00:00]  you left early and you  basically demanded that the  cake be brought out but  they were teasing us the  whole time that there was  all this homemade ice  cream they kept saying  homemade ice cream it's  like so all right I would  love to taste the  homemade ice cream before I  leave if my parents had a  little more of me in them  they would be teasing that  homemade ice cream and  you'd be like oh you know  we're gonna get to taste  this and they would be  like I'm sorry I should  have clarified the  homemade ice cream is for  those who stay for the  party but that's not what  happened and I even had  your father clarify in front 
[04:00:30]  of you and then you want to  talk about annoying your  girlfriend you know what  Troy started doing I  totally forgot about this  Troy started doing this  thing where I go Troy like  in front of my parents I  go Troy why would you make  such a scene and make them  bring out the cake early  let them go at their own  pace and while his  girlfriend was sitting next  to him in earshot of my  parents true or false true  true in earshot of my  parents he would go he said 
[04:01:00]  look I would really like  to stay my girlfriend's  got to go to work and  she you know she needs  her time and everything so  she would really like this  I would like to stay but  and you started shifting  all the blame she wasn't  there with that though to  your girlfriend who's  meeting all these people  for the first time yeah  that that that upset her  did she tell you that  that yeah yeah yeah she  she says that's what she  had enough of she was  dumb and then that's when  the car she goes enough  of you two what did she  say to you yeah she said  she's like I don't know  these people please don't 
[04:01:30]  do that and I said baby  just roll with the  punches come on she  doesn't want to roll with  those punches look just  you gotta learn to hang  loose like she and I  have hung out only a  handful of times so that  sort of getting to know  each other process is  still happening that's the  first time I think she  had met Jess and then  there's all these adults  that by the way she met  Jess okay maybe at the  wedding she met Jess right  but just yeah and then  Jess was talking about  she said Perla is so  great you know she can 
[04:02:00]  hang out with like you  and Troy and Roland but  then she was having  conversations with my mom  and your dad and she was  just great at the part  everybody loved her but  then she's got the  asshole boyfriend who's  gonna kind of shine the  spotlight on her and be  like by the way I know  we're leaving early but  it's her fault that's not  exactly a knight in  shining armor is it well  I think she would have  been okay with it if  she wasn't on her  period you're gonna  blame the period she  gets really fucking  cranky when she's  menstruating I mean a 
[04:02:30]  lot of girls do but so  it's just like roll with  the punches you don't  think she has grounds for  being upset not really  oh god well I'm like a  train ride she probably  wouldn't be happy by the  way with you coming on a  national radio show as  big as after open  Anthony live the show  that launched the career  of Carly Rae Jepsen and  announcing to the world  that she probably would be  okay except she's on the  rag well no we were at  the Dwayne Rude last  night and she was  buying tampons and I  had announced everybody  that she was buying  tampons what is she  that's like she's like  oh and she doesn't  care she's fun she 
[04:03:00]  rolls with the punches  right she didn't I  guess she's okay with  dating a third grader  she didn't realize  well that's what she's  getting herself into  okay in a train she  was sleeping and Troy  was falling asleep and  I had a little gas I  woke him up like she  thinks that's funny  okay like she thinks  rolling farting and  annoying everybody around  us where they're looking  at him like you fucking  pig she she starts  laughing and thinks  that's funny but she  doesn't want you then  trying to cut you were  trying to as a joke  shift the blade  humiliate her in front 
[04:03:30]  of a new crowd no I  was just look you know  it's a humiliating thing  to do to someone she  likes she she handles  uncomfortable situations  really well yeah and I  sometimes like to push  and see how you like to  test the boundaries yeah  because handling  uncomfortable situations  is a skill and practice  makes perfect is that  what you're trying to say  yeah it's like if you  want to hang you I'm  like you know I told  her I want a bitch that  can hang right so you  better hang and shit  can get a lot weirder  than this so this is just  the beginning you got to  tone up well I'm surprised  she hasn't set you on 
[04:04:00]  fire or something like  that I'm surprised she  puts up with your  bullshit to tell you the  truth she loves it she  does of course she does  well she didn't love it  when you humiliated her is  the only thing I told you  that because her fucking  holes bleeding oh this is  the period yeah if that  wasn't happening if she  didn't have to work she  would have been fine I  mean plus at the end of  the day obviously you're  a nice guy so of course  I'm a nice guy I'm  charming that's come  through loud and clear  here I was at PSI by the  trash can trade station  but they had cameras is 
[04:04:30]  that your new thing peeing  in public I always do  that's it what happened  your new thing was  exercise and juicing now  your new thing is  overeating boozing and  pissing in public  you're degenerating  Troy's a bad influence  yes Burt Kreischer is your  hero yeah and and Guy  Fieri is your other hero  and you wanted to drink  with him yes all right I  mean Troy do you feel any  sense of responsibility for  the downfall you did try I  mean to your credit you 
[04:05:00]  tried to motivate him in  one direction it didn't  work so I guess what you  said all right if we're  gonna go to the dark side  let's have a good time I've  also told him recently like  dude you really got to pull  it pull it together with the  weight yeah you know he's  gonna put do you think he's  gonna pack the pounds back on  for the winter yeah you do  yeah do you think you are  Roland I don't know okay he  is that's confirmed and you  can't look at me to help to  help him not drink because I  think that shit's funny and if  he's gonna do crazy shit I want  great pictures for my  Instagram so right which is  what Troy Kwan on Instagram 
[04:05:30]  oh you can see the picture of  Roland pissing in the phone  booth what do you know where'd  Eric go poo poo are you going  to poo poo you taking a little  poo poo no I had to go pee this  has been going on for a while now  you tell me Eric yeah what do  you think of this relationship  that's happened there's this is  sort of like a pseudo somewhat  sexual not gay but just there's a  little sexual there's a little  sexuality to it like a bromance  from Hades no going on here with  Roland and Troy it's a toxic 
[04:06:00]  bromance I was just gonna say it's  toxic it is right but I think it's  more toxic towards Roland than it  is towards Troy you don't think  they bring out the worst in each  other oh definitely but I think  Troy knows how to juggle that  better than Roland does Roland  will just go all out and  consequences be damned now we  talked on the air a little bit  about your relationship with Troy  and that that is well it's up and  down to say the least and that  you're kind of done with Troy  Roland on the other hand is an 
[04:06:30]  interesting case because Roland is  a guy that you used to hang out  with that was the guy at work that  you hung out with that was your you  were Troy Kwan Roland and Eric were  the power couple of the Opie and  Anthony show and now Roland and  Troy have become the power couple to  the extent that Troy has a drawer at  Roland's house yeah what do you think  of that like what do you think of how  Roland has has become Troy's best  friend it makes sense because they're  both single they can go out and do 
[04:07:00]  things what Troy you're single I thought  you got a living not married all right  he's got a living girlfriend she was  hanging out at my house yeah it just  talking about no it just said  unfortunately Eric moved a little bit  farther and Troy Eric storm off  so why did I storm off I don't know  do you think that it was justified  when I said when I questioned why he  said Troy's single when we had just  talked about his girlfriend for the  last 20 minutes I have no idea he's 
[04:07:30]  going to shit is he having a mental  breakdown wait hold on I just got  text he's bleeding he's bleeding must  be his period no no Eric's been weird I  mean he had that blow up today when he  he answered in vagueness today correct  yeah he does all the time but then he  got upset when we claimed it was vague  yeah but that's his that's his thing  don't you think if I said to him this  is a family party I'm sitting in the 
[04:08:00]  room and they're like why didn't you go  to the party and Eric responds by  saying I was told that as opposed to  saying Sam told me that it starts the  vagary right there and and also I  have Troy more because Eric moved a  bit farther away than like before he  was a hobo and right he used to and I  used to live on the west side I think  it's geographic to tell you the truth I  think I still live on the west side and  I think it's bullshit and quite honestly  don't you think I'm a lot more fun than  Eric would be I think rolling that  your personality shifted somewhat and  people's personalities change all the 
[04:08:30]  time I would never I didn't say it was  for the better or worse I think you  started hanging out with Troy you had a  good time with him and now you hang  out with Troy more than Eric that's  fine you don't it's not saying that  you don't like Eric just now that's  the guy you hang out with I don't think  it's geographic I think that's just the  guy that you have fun with yeah that's  fine yeah you come out to Westchester  yeah it's not geographic it's because  we have fun together Westchester Best  Chester Troy you've come out to  Westchester it's not because it's  geographic it's because we have fun we  do I think something's going on with  Eric though did his Legos fall apart 
[04:09:00]  hmm his Legos because he got some  Legos Sal do you know if his Legos  fell apart over the weekend no I asked  if he did any he said he didn't get a  chance you really did sit there and say  hey how was your weekend did you do  any Legos that's exactly what I said  did you ask him sarcastically or no I  was serious because I know my god he  bought some new Legos he did yeah Lord  of the Rings listen we got to go we  got to let Ron and Fez take over I  hope you guys will think about what  we've talked about today by the way I  totally was right against Kenny today 
[04:09:30]  come with us you guys lunch probably  I was totally I mean the wording of  that sentence grammatically you're  right I was completely right against  Kenny correct yes character but I  understand why Kenny would take it  the way he does emotionally Kenny can  have his point of view but logically  grammatically he's back that's not what  I said and there's no reason like Kenny  at your party would have been a good  time you know that I love Kenny again  again he'd make the medium list but I  invited the short list Ron and Fez are  coming up next he doesn't make the 
[04:10:00]  short list I'm sorry so stay tuned for  that yeah I do we'll be back  roller forgot his sunglasses at my house  because he was hammered we'll be back  with more of this tomorrow goodbye  the Opie and Anthony show is now over  for real this time </pre>
