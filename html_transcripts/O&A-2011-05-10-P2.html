<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, featuring Sam Roberts as host, began with a discussion between Sam and Than, his former co-host from a Saturday night show preceding "Special Delivery."  Their conversation centered on the circumstances surrounding Than’s departure from the O&A show and his subsequent career move to Rockstar Games.  This led to a significant discussion about Lazlo, described as a "pot-stirrer" who allegedly created conflict between Opie and Ron Bennington, and Opie and Danny. Lazlo's employment with Than at Rockstar further fueled the tension.  Travis’ recording of Patrice unexpectedly showcasing impressive singing talent was also played, sparking speculation about Patrice’s potential career shift.

Ron Bennington then joined the studio, adding another layer to the already contentious atmosphere.  Ron discussed his own show with Sam and recounted a recent heated exchange on Opie and Anthony, involving himself, Lazlo, and accusations of manipulation and dishonesty.  The conversation digressed frequently, touching upon Than's video game habits and Ron's perspective on the marketing of L.A. Noire, a video game he was promoting.  Throughout this segment, the language was informal and included frequent profanity and vulgar exchanges.

The discussion then shifted to a more general critique of the overall toxic and dysfunctional work environment at O&A.  Multiple staff members, including Than, Sam, and Ron, openly expressed resentments and strained relationships.  Specific points of contention included Than’s departure from "Sam and Than’s" show, with Ron admitting to starting a new show with Eastside Dave without informing Than.  The hosts and guests openly ranked their favorite and least favorite co-workers, with E-Rock (“sex bagel”) frequently cited as a source of conflict.  Ron’s statement that Ronnie B was "full of shit" further escalated the tension.  The lack of a unifying leader was identified as contributing to the negative work environment.  Meredith's departure was briefly mentioned, adding to the sense of change and discontent.  Ron continued to promote L.A. Noire throughout the segment, highlighting its unique features and lack of typical video game elements, despite the ongoing arguments. The broadcast ended with the hosts still visibly at odds.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  By the way, to those of you who  heard earlier on in the show  when I was accused yet again of hoarding content  by the, of course, post-interview with Larry King,  the one-minute interview I conducted with Larry King 
[00:00:30]  after he was off of ONA.  Somehow, I should have saved that for ONA.  And the reason I didn't save it for ONA  is because I knew that if I had given it  to Opie and Anthony today,  it would have gotten played as many times  as it did today after they complained,  which was zero.  So, hopefully, we'll hear that.  But look, is Opie coming back in?  Opie!  Is this the reunion show?  I was about to say, you're about to witness history.  This is the reunion show?  Because look who's here. 
[00:01:00]  I see Than is in the studio.  Than is here.  Thank you.  Travis.  I just have a quick question.  Did you film Patrice singing?  Yeah.  All right, I knew that.  Okay.  Today.  All right.  The other stuff, whatever.  But, I mean, Patrice singing with Warren Haynes,  that's so weird.  It's got to be on my YouTube channel.  I don't know what Lazlo's doing out there.  But, yeah, Patrice, were you surprised  that you could get that out of Patrice?  He had a pretty good voice, no?  Well, you guys were just like,  well, why doesn't Patrice sing?  And I thought he'd be like,  fuck you.  And he was like, yeah, okay. 
[00:01:30]  Look, we certainly want to beat up Patrice for it,  but his voice was pretty fucking strong.  Lazlo, I thought that Patrice was just going to flip you off  when you told him he should sing.  See, that's why I'm a good producer.  I put talent together.  And boom, he's there singing.  That was really smart.  He could do a record, that guy.  I mean, Patrice's voice.  It's unbelievable.  It's not bad.  It really wasn't bad.  And he wants to give up comedy,  so maybe he becomes a blues singer.  I think...  With a dead toe or whatever the fuck's dying on him.  I can see why he wants to give up comedy,  because when I saw him at Caroline's,  he was sweating like a bastard up on stage. 
[00:02:00]  He's just had it.  He's finished.  No, he loves doing it,  but he's just had it.  The grind, he's had it.  Kind of like me with radio.  I've had it with the grind.  I still like doing it, but...  You know what you should have done?  What?  And that's what Thane did.  The grind was starting to wear,  and he goes,  fuck this.  I don't need this.  Is this the reunion show?  I need to know.  Yeah, this is, isn't it?  Yeah.  All right, so why are we fucking...  Well, because you're the first guest.  Yeah, thanks for coming on.  No, thank you.  Welcome to the show.  I get to say that after three years. 
[00:02:30]  Because he's a host again.  Yeah.  All right.  It doesn't leave you.  You know that.  Well, I'm still in his blood.  I'd like you guys to get down  to what happened between you,  because...  Look at Lazlo trying to stir the pot.  Something happened.  Well, somehow I knew that Lazlo was doing that,  because every time he comes in here,  he stirs the pot with somebody.  That's all he does.  What happened was...  What did you say today?  You're just trying to ruin fucking friendships.  I thought I was bad,  but Lazlo comes in here,  and his whole goal is to just ruin friendships.  I mean, you both went on the air.  Because Lazlo instigated this thing, 
[00:03:00]  you both asserted that Ron Bennington  is full of shit today.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That was an Opie-Lazlo effort.  That was more Lazlo than me.  Yeah.  I mean, Opie was just finally achieving that friendship  that he wanted with Ron Bennington after...  Yeah, we've been getting along.  Because of the co-hosting stuff.  We actually always got along,  but we worked together and worked out pretty well.  Figured out each other's...  And now Lazlo has decided that friendship has to go away.  No.  What other friendship did he try to break up today?  We just have to...  What? 
[00:03:30]  We just have to admit...  Oh, Danny.  You went after Danny.  I went after Danny.  That's easy.  That's easy, he says.  That's easy.  Danny's a train wreck in motion.  Danny should come on this show sometimes.  Stan has officially, I think,  done after ONA Live more times than Danny.  Oh, really?  Yeah, do I get a shirt or a cake or something?  Yeah, there should be something.  Does Travis do this show?  He nods.  He nods.  He says yes by nodding.  Yeah.  I'm, you know, behind the scenes.  You can put headphones on.  You've got to put headphones on.  He said, yeah, I'm behind the scenes. 
[00:04:00]  I'll give you a thumbs up.  Are you behind the scenes?  What?  Are you saying shitty stuff about me?  I don't blame you.  Fuck this guy right here.  See how paranoid I am?  I have no headphones on.  I think he just said some shitty stuff.  He just said, nice, backwards hat, asshole.  Oh, really?  He just said, yes.  Yes, that's exactly what he said.  Well, because I have a kid.  I haven't had a haircut in months.  Me neither.  I don't have any kids.  I've got to get a fucking haircut.  Shut up, Laszlo.  I made sure I was...  As soon as I walked into this room  that I had headphones,  there was no way.  Yeah.  Somebody was just going to... 
[00:04:30]  It's because people are just...  But really, what happened between you two?  Because you had a show together.  All right.  No.  I'll listen in the car.  I'll leave her on that.  That's it?  I'm supposed to go on...  And you're going to ask the question and not...  I'm on Eminem's station in like two minutes.  I think he's there.  Sam, this is what you do.  You just go,  so, then, what happened between us?  Like it was his fault.  Yeah, and then he'll go,  well, I don't know, Sam.  What did happen between us?  And then you can go back and forth.  I don't know.  Water under the bridge.  Yeah.  Notice this has nothing to do  with the Opie and Anthony show anymore this hour?  When did it? 
[00:05:00]  You were...  Jesus Christ.  I gave you a week.  Fucking hijacked.  You hijacked an hour of our show.  Well, I let you on.  And Mashman's not even saying anything about it.  They like it.  This is their favorite part of the show.  We're going to play some classic Fan and Sam bits, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to go through the library.  Play classic bits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had a great scene, yeah.  Nice scene, you old.  You have the dongle?  Dongle?  What's a dongle?  By the way, uh...  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  You do have it?  What was that?  Thumbs up for what?  Nothing.  Some things are best left between men.  If you guys were still friends, maybe you would get some, you know... 
[00:05:30]  Well, we're trying to mend the relationship.  Did you give it to me?  Well, we haven't had time because you're barging in on my show.  Let's get the Warren Haynes Patrice.  Why did you replace Than with the other guy?  Well, I was trying...  I was like Warren Haynes-ing this thing.  Right.  Like, I was doing different shows, different bands, whatever.  He wanted a taste of each of the greats.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, that's not what you say, Than, like, when we're at work and you're...  And I was like, oh, you know...  Oh, my God.  Laszlo is the worst.  I thought I was bad.  You suck. 
[00:06:00]  So stick around for it.  No, I'll let you guys hash this out.  All right.  Thanks, Laszlo.  You did a really great show and then you just...  Well, I appreciate the compliment.  Yeah.  You kind of kicked your friend to the curb.  He wasn't doing radio anymore.  Than badmouth Sam at work?  Oh, like it's my job.  Yeah, I'm sure he's still bitter about it after all these years because Than and Sam  was just such a profitable show for both of us, once a month for free.  Yes.  Well, let's go with it.  Why did the show end?  The show ended because... 
[00:06:30]  For those of you who don't know who Than is, it's been a few years.  Than...  It has been at this point.  No, it's not a dick thing to say.  Than was a producer for the Opie and Anthony show, a super producer.  Senior producer.  Oh, is that what it was?  That's what the S standard for.  Not super.  And, you know, I don't want to spoil one of your more famous bits because I have it pulled.  If we play bits today, which, as I just told Opie, is not a guarantee.  It's not always about Opie and Anthony.  And then Than and I did a show on Saturday nights before Special Delivery starring Sam 
[00:07:00]  and Dave.  The original offshoot of the Opie and Anthony show on Saturday nights was Than and Sam.  So there's people out there that are like,  who the fuck is...  They don't know who Than is.  There was a show before Special Delivery?  There's more people who are saying, what is Special Delivery?  I've never heard of this show.  Then why is my radio still on?  Yeah, exactly.  And who is this guy talking to me?  But, yes, there was...  It was called Than and Sam because at this point it was three years ago or something.  It's getting there, yeah.  Two and a half years ago that we stopped doing the show. 
[00:07:30]  And what had happened was, we were doing it, we were getting frustrated because we could  only get on about once every month and a half to two months.  Than left Opie and Anthony and we realized that we only spoke the day before or the day  of the show.  And beyond that, you and I didn't speak, not hostily, but just didn't, correct?  Correct.  And so, in the meantime, Eastside Dave said, hey, why don't we record some stuff? 
[00:08:00]  Why don't we do a show?  Why don't we do a show?  And I said, I don't...  Okay.  Than is not here right now.  I guess I don't have a contract.  You're not in the room as I'm talking to you.  Yeah, I could just go do a show.  And then I did the show with Dave.  And then we stopped doing Than and Sam after that.  There was a small period of time where there was crossover.  Yeah.  That was stupid.  And then it got weird because...  Yeah.  Because then it was like, you didn't know what to do, what content on what show. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  So, best stuff goes to ONA.  Especially because I'm still on Opie and Anthony five days a week.  Who do I split up the garbage with?  Yeah.  And that's all it is to this day.  I mean, you haven't missed much.  I believe you.  But, all right.  But let's get real.  That's how I keeps it.  I was disappointed with how the last show went.  How do you mean?  Because we had agreed that I was going to fire you. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  To this day, there is every now and then, I'll get one person who says that you fired me.  But it says it like they're insulting me.  Yeah.  And I haven't had the heart to ever say, because I just like gimmicks so much, that was something we had planned.  It was a work.  Yes.  But, you sort of, and I always fuck up this, heel flip?  Is that right?  I mean, no, but go ahead.  What's the term?  Heel turn.  Heel turn.  Okay.  I always fuck that up. 
[00:09:30]  You sort of heel turned it and made it into plugging the special delivery show, which I actually, it did bug me.  It did?  No shit.  No shit.  Yes.  Well, I don't.  Because you were doing a bit, and I know why you, you know, it was a bit.  Yeah.  Well.  But it was like my last, my last couple minutes of airtime were spent in a sad place, as opposed to, as opposed to like, yeah, bitches.  That terminology.  I'm out of here.  Oh, I feel so small. 
[00:10:00]  I guess, I mean, I can't go back to that.  I would think that my thinking was that you would, in turn, shit on special delivery and then inflate yourself.  I guess I tried to, but I was like, oh my God.  And then like, we were running out of time.  It was like 30 seconds left.  And we had to come back from a break and there was like 45 seconds left.  I was like, all right, I got to muster up my anger.  And then I was like, okay, bye.  And then that was the end of the, the Fan and Sam show.  Well.  So.  Well, not really, because it's, I mean, obviously back today. 
[00:10:30]  It's, it is back.  And I'm glad, uh, we had a chance to, to start fresh.  So I'll be coming by every day at 10 o'clock.  Wow.  Okay.  So you are actually high, you are hijacking my hijacked show.  That's what I'm hearing is what you offered me.  Well, if it, if it makes you feel, and it was, uh, shitty that I, the one bit of shittiness  that I will absolutely take credit for is that I never said, Hey, fan, I was thinking  I'm going to start doing a show with Dave.  Yes.  I just started doing it. 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  Which was a shitty thing to do.  And it was an unfortunate coincidence that, uh, the night before this is all coincidence  that, yeah, that was not my, it wasn't by design, but the night before I'm getting married,  uh, I get like a Facebook invite from Dave's wife to check out a show with Sam and Dave.  And I'm like, what a, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember that because I, uh, I, at that point said that Dave, maybe just have everybody check  who they're sending messages to.  And if it's really necessary because, uh, yeah, I mean the design would have been because 
[00:11:30]  than was getting married, uh, as Sam and Dave was coming on, the design would have been for  me to talk to than about it after he was done dealing with his wedding, not realizing that  the day before said wedding, he would find out and then have to look me in the face at  his wedding and just be like, you stupid fucking son of a bitch.  You come to my wedding, eat my food.  Yeah.  And there was delicious food.  It was, it was dancing, smiling, laughing, smile at me. 
[00:12:00]  Like, like you're my friend, but yeah, but, uh, but I'm, I'm, I'm so I'm glad we, uh, we  worked that out.  If it makes you feel any better, I'm still doing that same goddamn shitty time slot for  the same, no money.  So if you had stayed on with Sam and Sam, it would have gone the same place that Sam and  Dave has gone, which is nowhere.  Fair enough.  So that should make you feel better.  Yeah.  And that's kind of why I, uh, started exploring other options anyway. 
[00:12:30]  So.  Right.  Right.  Um, and you were kind of done.  And I, I got the vibe you were a little done with radio, uh, specifically the virus sort  of.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I definitely, I liked, I mean, I'll always love radio.  I mean, like, you know, I, I quit another job to do radio.  So, so, and, and I made it to fucking producer of the opening Anthony show, which, uh, senior  producer.  Don't undersell yourself.  Yeah.  So, you know, it's, you know, it was awesome, but yeah, I just, it wasn't. 
[00:13:00]  And I, but I liked, I liked our show cause I guess it was still like a connection back  to the radio.  Yeah.  But if it wasn't working and like, if neither of us had our hearts in it, then it was kind  of stupid.  Yeah.  Um, I would never say it was stupid though.  Who's it?  The phone keeps ringing and I keep like wanting to answer it cause I'll bet there are, let's  open the phones.  866-WOW-1-WOW, 866-969-1969 and tell fan that you remember him because that's the thing.  Just validate me. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Just validate him cause time passes and it's like you were a major part of the show while  you were here.  The opening Anthony show.  Right.  The opening Anthony show.  And then.  Not so much the fan and Sam shows.  No.  No, no, you were, you were, you were a side player there, but, uh, on ONA and it was almost,  I thought you were kind of getting groomed to be the next executive producer, which is  just, I mean, a shitty position for anyone to be in.  Right, Travis? 
[00:14:00]  Huh?  Yep.  Exactly.  Um, but first of all, I'll ask you this.  You left open Anthony on your own terms.  Correct.  And that was a fucking middle fingers.  Both ways.  And by your own terms, I meant you spoke to Opie, Anthony, Jim individually and said,  I'd like to explore other things, but I appreciate all, everything you've done for me.  And it was, your own terms were luckily amicable.  Yes.  Um, but, what, it's been what, three years since you left?  Two and a half.  Two and a half years? 
[00:14:30]  No, three, three, three years.  Three years.  So, how good is it to get out of this place?  Because, listen, as you said, we're going to get real.  I try to be honest on this show, as Opie and Anthony do on their show.  Yep.  There's not one person on this staff that doesn't envy what you did.  Travis, can you back me up or are you not allowed?  I'm answering the phone.  Okay.  Yeah, no, there isn't one person here who doesn't, on some level, envy what you did.  How good is it?  It feels, uh...  And don't worry, like, I know that you loved what you did here. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  So, that's not what we're getting at.  Yeah.  Uh, it feels pretty cool.  Yeah.  I mean, mostly because it was on my own terms, you know?  I wasn't fired or, you know, the show wasn't, you know, whatever, canceled or whatever.  I decided to leave and try something else.  And you were doing comedy, right?  I was doing stand-up for a while.  Uh, I did it pretty hardcore.  I was doing, like, ten shows a week.  Wow.  Uh, when I, but then it just sort of was like, huh, I'm not getting paid to do this either. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  So, that's, like, another unpaid, uh, pursuit of mine.  Uh, well, why, why did you leave radio?  Or ONA, whatever you want to say.  However you want to put it.  Uh, to both pursue stand-up and also just, like, uh, just thought it was a good time for me.  You just need time to breathe and find Thane again, not be...  Yeah.  Yeah, I get it.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's the other thing, is, uh, when, you know, I was definitely a fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  I get that 100%. 
[00:16:00]  As a fellow producer, you would understand.  And so, you know, and that was, and the, the good parts of that were awesome.  And then, you know, but also...  Yeah, live extra exposure.  Yep.  Uh, a national platform.  But at the same time, it wasn't your platform.  Yeah.  And, you know, I think, uh, I'm awesome.  So, I...  I agree.  So, I, uh, I wanted to just try my own thing.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, uh, I don't do as much stand-up anymore. 
[00:16:30]  I do mostly improv and stuff.  But I, I, I do try to be funny for, you know, for entertainment purposes.  But, uh, having this new job is fucking awesome.  Yeah, so you're doing stand-up, and then how long did you do stand-up for, like, hardcore like that?  Uh, a couple years at least.  And you were just like, uh...  Yeah, I mean, like...  I'm not getting where I want to be.  Or, like, were you thinking that the goals of this do not really line up with what I see myself?  Yeah, plus I was married, you know, it's, you know, I had to think of being, uh, you know, 
[00:17:00]  and my wife was very supportive, but I also needed to think about having a steady paycheck, too.  What about a family?  Is that in the future?  It's possibly in the future.  All right, so we're still on the possible level.  Mm-hmm.  Um, and you, I remember, so now you work for Rockstar.  Yes.  And that's full-time.  It says right on my T-shirt.  See that T-shirt.  And New York City.  Yeah.  Incredible.  Wow.  So you can really find me easily.  That's very, uh, that's very nice.  Uh, and your whole job is playing the games all day and doing the cool shit that you see 
[00:17:30]  in trailers.  Pretty much.  Now, I remember specifically one thing we did on Than and Sam was I tried to tell you  that you had a harmful addiction to video games.  Yes.  Boy, did you prove me wrong.  You have turned it into a career.  Yes.  No, I mean, it, it's been incredibly, because everybody thought that of me and they were right.  Mm-hmm.  They were, it was not healthy.  No.  But, I remember at one point you were playing, uh, you had to play Xbox with a timer because  you were, you were limiting yourself. 
[00:18:00]  It's like an alcoholic only having three drinks a night.  Yeah.  You know.  I, I definitely had, uh, uh, some sort of dependency on, on video games.  And I'm sure that couldn't have helped any of my other goals in life, even after I left  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Like, you know, probably could have written more had I not been playing video games.  Well, now that I don't have a job, this is a lot of time for games.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  And you know, and that, for the first month, you're like, fuck it, I'm, I just quit my  job.  Yeah.  I get to enjoy it.  Got a little severance, right? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  So you got a, well, a very little severance.  So you, so you have something, but, um.  I think they let me cash my last paycheck.  Oh, that's nice.  Well.  They didn't put a stop on it.  So that was a good start.  Um, but yeah.  And then, so then you're like, and then it just gets slowly more depressing.  You're like, how much.  I'm not doing anything.  I'm not doing a goddamn thing.  Um, so how did you end up with rockstar?  I guess Laszlo told us on the show, he saw you on a bridge ready to jump.  Is that the story he was weaving? 
[00:19:00]  I don't want to quite ruin this spell, but, uh, you know, uh, the one thing I was doing  was exercising and playing video games.  Ah.  It's not anything else.  Just exercise?  Not looking for work?  Video games.  Or, you know.  How did your wife feel about exercising video games?  She liked the exercise.  She was definitely all behind that.  And she knew better to like, she didn't, it was like a junkie though, because she didn't  want to be like, you can't do video games because she didn't want to be like the  bad guy.  Right.  So.  It was an enabler is what she was.  No, but she tried. 
[00:19:30]  She definitely tried.  She tried to find like, like creative ways to just kind of wean you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  And, you know, but it did get to the point where she's like, uh, give me the controller.  I'm going to hide it.  And I'm like, that's going to turn out so ugly because then I'm going to hate you for  keeping the controller from me.  Yeah.  Again, the drug parallels.  They're right there.  Yeah.  Uh, you'd spent so much time with Laszlo coming on ONA.  He's your boss now.  Yes.  Like he tells you what to do.  Yeah.  Is that weird?  Um, no.  You're like the guy from the technophile. 
[00:20:00]  You're going to tell me what to do.  He's not going to, uh, he's not, it's not like he's a turns into a douche.  Uh-huh.  He's, he's still Laszlo.  And, you know, when it's, when we're, when it's, I know you from ONA time, like buddy  time, it's buddy time.  And when you have to do shit, it's time to do shit.  So.  Do you, do you, well, do you still get to do voices for the games?  Um, not for, no.  All right.  Is it like a rule or you just didn't, this time?  Because I didn't get asked either.  I, but I don't, I think Laszlo doesn't like me.  That's my own theory. 
[00:20:30]  Uh, and you're getting a thumbs up from the booth.  I'm asking Travis.  Well, Travis and me, it's fine.  I wasn't asked to do it either, but.  Well, yeah.  Do you think Laszlo likes you?  I think he does.  I think my voice was so recognizable in Grand Theft Auto 4.  You were in Grand Theft Auto 4?  I was the gun salesman.  I've been to the store.  I don't recognize the voice.  No, you definitely do.  Oh.  It really, it, it, yeah.  It, you sound a little different.  Did you change your voice at all?  Or you just do your thing?  Yeah, I did a little, a little different.  Gun, gun store version of Travis?  Well, hey, uh, this, I don't even remember my lines.  I would totally do one.  Nice. 
[00:21:00]  I'm sorry to let you get that.  Travis is still in the same spot since when you left, too.  Nothing changes after three years.  And, you know, I'm picturing in my head, and it's awesome, so thank you.  It doesn't work on the radio, but for me, personally, I'm having a great time.  Do you miss the exposure of being on Opie and Anthony, or?  Oh, yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because, I mean, and two or three times, I actually got recognized.  Well, and that was the other shitty thing, like, to get some of these awesome, awful spots  for stand-up I was doing, I'd have to do stuff like hand out flyers for the show. 
[00:21:30]  So, like, if anybody's ever been in New York City and walked through Times Square...  You like comedy?  You like comedy?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I, I, but I'm not, a lot of those guys aren't comedians, like, some of them are, but some  of them are just, like, ticket salesmen and douches.  You know, I, I feel for the guys that were doing what I was doing, and that they're just  trying to do it for stage time.  Yeah.  But, I actually, you know, it was cool.  I actually, two or three times, got recognized by my voice.  Oh.  Like, somebody heard me say, hey, you want to check out a show?  And they're like, fan?  I'm like, what?  Who? 
[00:22:00]  So, so it was cool for a second, and then you're like, oh, I'm...  Yeah.  So will you come to the show then?  Yeah.  If you want me to do stand-up for fucking five, uh, Polish people...  Yeah.  Please come.  Yeah.  Does anybody ever go to those things?  I, yes, sometimes, but it's all, it's usually foreigners.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Do they actually buy the, uh...  Yeah, Comedians Comedy Central.  Well, I would, uh...  Yeah, some people would, like, just lie.  Just not tell them the truth.  Just not be like, there's a comedy... 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, they're taping a Comedy Central show tonight.  Mm-hmm.  Um, you can't sell tickets to a taping.  No.  Like, that's just a rule.  Right, free, free tickets.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, as soon as you spend 20 bucks, you can guarantee there's not a single camera  on.  Insight from the...  Um, but, so...  Oh, no, now I'm not gonna get asked back to all these clubs.  But, uh, but, yeah.  Uh...  That's all right, you get paid to play video games all day.  That's true.  Fuck them.  Uh, yeah, but so they, uh...  The people would come, and the shows, yeah, that was part of the... 
[00:23:00]  I was doing shows for five drunk people at three in the morning.  Yeah.  On a Saturday.  And, like, you know, like, and they wouldn't, they would, they were, they just thought they  were in their living room.  Like, they were just so hammered.  Ignoring you and yelling.  Yeah.  There's, like, this woman in a dress, spread-eagled, and, like, not hot.  Like, it should have been, but it was just, like...  It wasn't at all.  It was just, bleh.  And they're going, I gotta, maybe, fighting for 30 seconds of air time on someone else's 
[00:23:30]  show wasn't so bad.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, yeah, and she, like, this, I remember the one moment, she was just like, I'm hungry.  In the middle of your set?  Yeah.  Not, like, not, she didn't wait for any pause or, like, between anything.  She's like, I'm hungry.  And you were like, do I comment on this?  Do I just plow through?  Yeah, because you can only slow down the show so much, like, because otherwise, then you're  just hanging out with people.  Right.  And, I mean, if it's only five people, maybe that is the route.  Just sit on the stool and be like, how you guys doing?  Yeah.  No, I definitely try that a few nights, too. 
[00:24:00]  But, also, I'm like, I wrote jokes.  I'd like to try to practice my jokes, too.  Yeah, that would be why I'm up in the middle of the night and try to get you people here.  If it does make you feel better, we do have people who remember you.  For instance, Scott in New Mexico says he loved Tan on the old shows.  Thank you, Scott.  There you go.  Scott, I'm a big fan of you, too.  Nick in Wisconsin.  You're on After Opie and Anthony live.  Stan, welcome back.  I just want to say, also, if you're ever at the Comedy Club on State, show up there. 
[00:24:30]  I'll buy you around.  Great to hear you back on here, man.  You're a fucking hysterical.  Thank you very much, Nick.  It's kind of you to say.  Eric in Orlando.  I've still got it.  See that repartee I got with the colors?  You're on After O&A.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, buddy?  First off, Stan, it's really good to hear you again.  And I remember when I first listened, when you first came on XM, the one thing that  was good about Dan was...  Eric, Eric, I've got to interrupt you for a second. 
[00:25:00]  Travis?  He was complimenting me.  There's something you've got to play.  Oh, Travis is scrambling.  Yeah, he's scrambling.  Travis is scrambling.  Eric, I don't...  Oh, no!  It couldn't be.  Not here.  I was just talking to...  And I didn't want you to see.  This is fucking disgusting.  It's the great Ron Bennington.  First of all, I happen to be very good friends with Eastside Dave McDonald.  Well, don't tell him.  I don't want him to know.  This is really awkward. 
[00:25:30]  I mean, you've put me in a very odd position.  I didn't think you'd be here, Ronnie.  It's good to see you, Ron.  Ron, I'm...  Well, you know what?  Fan.  Is it Fan, really?  Yeah.  That doesn't seem like a person's fucking name.  What kind of person would be named Fan?  Ron and me have been working on our own show.  It starts at about...  Between 1048 and 1050 every day.  And lasts until 1052, 1056.  It's called Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart.  This is so weird to see you guys together. 
[00:26:00]  At one point, I considered you guys...  Yeah?  ...the new Ron and Fez.  You did?  I said to people, I said, keep an eye on them.  They're the new Ron and Fez.  And it turned out that way that only one guy cared about it.  But then you quit radio...  Yep.  ...to dedicate yourself to stand-up comedy.  Yeah.  Now, I'm watching...  You know, I have HBO.  Yep.  So...  I have Comedy Central.  I can't afford HBO.  How is it? 
[00:26:30]  Well, I keep waiting for you.  I'm waiting for you to show up.  Yeah, me too.  It's, you know...  So you're staying with the stand-up?  Not really.  I'm doing some improv, but it's mostly just to scratch an itch.  He's got a new gig.  Yeah.  You think they give t-shirts like that to anyone?  What are you doing at Rockstar?  I'm working with Laszlo.  I help make their trailers and stuff.  Okay.  Let's get back to the improv.  Okay.  That's something we all care about.  All right.  Let's get something going on.  All right.  Right now, let's go.  A couple occupations.  Sam is the DUI guy. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  See, that's not the improv that I do.  What?  I do the classy long-form improv.  All right.  When I yell freeze, you guys have to stop exactly where you are.  And then yell at a different location.  How long have you been at Rockstar?  About half a year.  Now, Laszlo was in here yesterday with me.  I heard.  And it was a very awkward, I'll go so far to say horrible day with him.  Yeah.  Actually, did you hear us talking about that on O&A?  No.  Well, Ron, you're not going to lie. 
[00:27:30]  I don't even know what I should tell you.  You're not going to like what was said.  What was said?  Well, basically, Laszlo brought up Fez accusing him of trying to make him cry.  Laszlo brought up that he accused you of being a puppet master.  Right.  And I don't mean to rat people out, but it was on national radio.  Opie agreed.  And then Laszlo said, Ronnie B is full of shit.  Full of shit is what Laszlo said. 
[00:28:00]  And, Than, I know he's your boss, but I'm not lying.  Here's the biggest mistake that I did.  When Ant went on vacation, Opie said, hey, would you come in?  And I did that with an open heart, and I did it a couple days.  And since then, since that act of kindness, Opie doesn't be able to seem to forgive me.  I know.  And it's a matter of, Opie feels like he owes me, so now he's going to say bad things about me.  I told him just on this show, Than was a witness.  He walked in, and I said, Opie, you know, you and Ron were just starting to build up a friendship. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  And then you and Laszlo play the Ronnie B is full of shit game on Opie and Anthony.  It's not like...  Let me see if I have Laszlo's number anyway.  Okay.  Let me see if I fucking have this.  I think he's still here somewhere.  Is he?  I think so.  Bring him in, because he's made a fucking enemy of me.  I think he's...  He's made a fucking enemy of me.  And I'm telling you right now, I don't see anything happening with this new game.  I mean, there is some...  They put $600 million into this game, and no one's talking about it. 
[00:29:00]  Fan, that $600 million?  Yeah.  They haven't released those figures.  This is the most expensive fucking game in gaming history, and I kid you not, and you  guys...  You read the game Trades.  Yeah.  So, what's the vibe on it?  This gigantic amount of money went into this.  Now, at some point, they let the filmmakers start to do this stuff.  I was reading about this.  They're using Leno's cards.  They're paying Leno.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  I played fucking Asteroids for years.  You didn't need Leno's cards for that. 
[00:29:30]  Exactly.  They didn't have to pay Than to play it all day for Asteroids.  By the way, why do you need a trailer to a game?  Because it builds up hype.  It's fantastic.  It's building buzz.  These kids are talking about it.  YouTube generation, Ron.  YouTube generation.  Well, of course, we're talking about L.A. Noire coming out May 7th.  Oh, Jesus.  No one cares.  She did it.  No one cares.  Can I tell you something?  A game should not be in the past.  It needs to be in the future.  This is a great theory.  I love this premise. 
[00:30:00]  No game.  It's a video game.  Right.  It should be the future.  Well, video game, you're basically saying science fiction.  Right.  But who wants science fiction?  Where you guys go next?  Cavemen?  Two fucking cavemen hitting each other with clubs?  Either way, it's time travel.  That's beautiful and magical.  And come on.  It's not here.  You know what?  You're saying the right things, but your heart isn't into it.  And I hear the delivery.  You're like, come on.  It's time travel.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, if you're in one of your long-form improv classes right now, it wouldn't work. 
[00:30:30]  Now, here's the problem, right?  How the fuck am I the puppet master?  That's what we said.  But wouldn't I have Fez doing other stuff?  Why would he just say, I don't like you?  I'm unhappy to be...  You've puppeteered him in such a way that he won't speak on your show.  He doesn't?  Yes, it doesn't make sense.  You should have puppeteered that cat thing a little better.  But why...  Exactly.  Why am I... 
[00:31:00]  You know, the thing is, we are so tired of saying what Fez should change.  Now we're going to move on and what Ron should change.  You see the way things are shifting.  Yeah.  That everybody's saying, well, Ron is just a puppeteer.  Ron is just a guy...  What is Laszlo's real name, by the way?  Laszlo Jones.  Get the fuck down.  First of all, his name isn't Laszlo.  He's one of 800 million fucking geek kids who saw real fucking genius and then went, call  me Laszlo.  Because Laszlo has become the new stretch, you know? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  That is a great movie, though.  Do you know his real name, Than, or are you not at liberty to discuss?  That's his name.  Laszlo Jones.  You know, Laszlo is Than's boss now, like legit.  Do you know that Laszlo has an uncomfortable relationship with his own sister?  I didn't know that either.  I was at Bar 9 one night, and Laszlo was more or less flirting slash being inappropriate 
[00:32:00]  with his own sister.  I want him to come in here so badly.  Oh, I want him to, too.  I do, too, because I don't know where to go.  I want Mr. fucking, oh, Ronnie B is full of shit to fucking come in.  He said it.  Ronnie B is full of shit.  I will fucking drill him for this shit.  I will drill him.  I did everything I could yesterday to try to get some kind of excitement of this time  travel fucking video game.  Wait, wait.  Is this officially a time travel video game?  You're traveling through time and space. 
[00:32:30]  Okay.  You start in the present.  That's not entirely accurate, but yeah.  You, you, it takes place another time.  And you need a time machine.  I just don't want to, because.  Well, why doesn't it have the fun and excitement of the other games?  It has all kinds of fun and excitement.  But I mean, like the other games that we all loved, where we're stealing cars, we're doing  stuff.  Now it's like, we're in old Los Angeles.  What?  It's a steep, time steeped in alcohol and jazz.  And I'm just reading, I'm reading marketing points. 
[00:33:00]  Seriously.  We could have jazz now.  There's like one fucking club that has jazz.  Patrice just saying the blues.  Uh, it's, it's, it's different.  It's not all blowing shit up.  It's, it's more about, uh, you know, interrogating people solving crimes.  It's cool.  Yeah.  I mean, it's no asteroids, Ron.  But, uh, you know, or joust.  And there's not enough, and I've talked about that, but it's almost like, to me, this is  like, it's like, okay, you're taking the action out of an action movie. 
[00:33:30]  Who wants to interrogate people?  It can't always be action movies, Ron.  You can't always, I mean, Fast Five is a brilliant film.  I, I, I give you that.  I haven't seen it.  Don't ruin it.  All right.  Well, they get in a car.  Uh, but it's not, you don't want to watch that every day.  And yet people do.  85 million.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First weekend out.  By the way, did you guys see Thor yet?  No.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  What'd you do that for?  Uh, cause I thought it was, I, I, it was, I made a mistake. 
[00:34:00]  You know, we're talking about mistakes I've made on this show.  Thor is probably my biggest, it was the biggest mistake of his life.  Yeah.  It was right when Thor, the, the, the, the title showed up on screen.  I say to my wife, I think we should leave.  I just, I lost all faith in it as soon as the title showed up.  And that turned out to be accurate?  Yeah.  Just a mediocre.  I actually thought like Roth Thor, we could have got David Lee Roth to play this part.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you're thinking on an existential level.  I don't know. 
[00:34:30]  I think we're running way into your time.  We, we got time.  I want to get to the bottom of what's been going on with that.  If I have just five seconds.  You could talk as, you could, as much as you want.  But here's the problem.  You guys had something hot going.  You had something beautiful going.  I mean.  Sam and Sam.  Bi-monthly Saturday night show.  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  I mean, it's been two and a half years.  You wouldn't know it was Sam and Sam, but yeah.  Yeah.  They never did get that name right.  What is it really?  Yeah.  You always got the name wrong.  I didn't correct you.  What was the name?  Sam and Sam.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  But you would always put, just like with Sam and Dave, the name Sam always goes first, no  matter what you're doing.  Yeah.  I've always been in that school of thought myself.  I mean, it's just, this is fucking show business before any of us got into it.  Yeah.  The name Sam is always a lead name.  It doesn't mean that he's the lead guy.  But in some cases.  Yeah.  I mean, today you've got that impressive board in front of you.  So that thing was popping.  Things were happening with you guys.  It was sizzling.  Well.  Then you said to yourself.  To an extent.  I love doing this show.  I don't like getting Opie's coffee or whatever. 
[00:35:30]  Something happened during the morning that you weren't happy with.  Yeah.  I mean, I wasn't getting coffee anymore, but yeah.  But what happened?  One of the guys, one of the other producers.  If you were still working for this show, you would have been getting coffee.  But go on, Ron.  Was it one of the other producers that annoyed him?  He couldn't put up with it?  I think that Than, it happens to producers, he wanted to not be under someone's umbrella.  Whose umbrella were you under?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, but so it was more about O and A. It wasn't about, let's say, Steve or anybody in the back that was running things. 
[00:36:00]  I didn't have a problem with any of the other producers.  But you didn't like Danny, though.  I like Danny, fine.  I just figured I see.  Everybody likes Danny.  Oh, I know.  I like Danny.  Danny is the only one of your guys that are a producer that feels like a guy to me.  Like a regular guy.  Because he's angry?  Yeah, but I mean, like, he's the only one of your producers who goes, I'm going to use my masculine qualities.  Oh.  Where the rest of you guys are like, and you're all fine guys, but you're all like, um, hey, we should brunch. 
[00:36:30]  And I'm like, I don't know.  You know what I mean?  Have you ever wanted to brunch, though?  I hear you, Ron.  That's why I got out of here.  A lot of them will go like this.  Do you think tan's the new black?  And I go, I don't even know what that means.  But so you weren't happy every day.  You're just sitting there.  You're glaring at ONA going, that could fucking be me.  Grinding your teeth.  Wicking right at Opie's blue eyes.  And you're like, it just missed the line.  I had that fucking mic.  You know what?  I do impressions and no one even lets me. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  So that was your thing.  Pretty much.  Once you got off, you said to us, I want to be the next big stand-up comic.  I want to be the, I remember what you said to me.  Trust me.  He goes like this.  Ronnie B, trust me.  I'll be the last comic standing.  Oh.  And then, so now you've given up.  Turns out that was taken.  But you've given up on stand-up.  Pretty much.  You're in Laszlo's shadow for whatever fucking reason.  Are you under the Laszlo umbrella? 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  Okay.  It's only a matter of time.  Yeah.  By the way, this thing of me and fucking Laszlo, and I'm inviting him back, the fucking war is on.  I would believe you, but he tells me you're full of shit, so I don't know who to trust.  That motherfucker, he even said it to you off air.  He said, yeah.  He said it.  Okay, good.  And he said it in my headphone.  Son of a bitch.  That's right.  So, there's a fucking war.  This is a war that will go on.  This is great.  I love wars.  I'm going to quote Than here. 
[00:38:00]  I will be the last comic standing.  Well, that's good to know.  What does that even mean, by the way, the last comic standing?  I, you know.  Just because you work for Rockstar, what are you going to wear the fucking t-shirt?  I'm promoting the game.  The only people that do that are interns.  I'm promoting L.A. Noire.  It's coming out on May 17th, Ron.  This is the time travel game.  Are you making fun of people who wear brands on their clothes, like producers who wear hats with the Sirius XM logo on it?  Yeah.  It means, what that means is I don't feel confident in myself, so let me use the company.  But this game is not, were you shocked when it came out? 
[00:38:30]  Well, it's coming out next week.  But I mean, were you shocked that the buzz was there for the last couple of games?  There's buzz.  Tons of buzz.  I don't know.  I help make that buzz every day with my, you know, some of the work I do.  Oh, shit.  Oh, here it comes.  Oh, shit.  What?  I told him that some of the things.  What things?  Dude, we're so bad.  Seriously.  Remember what you said?  Oops.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  We're throwing pens on each other.  Now we're throwing shit.  Oh, boy. 
[00:39:00]  But let's go back into this.  You said that he was a troublemaker from before.  You played me a tape once that he kept trouble going.  Laszlo.  I said Laszlo is absolutely a troublemaker.  You can't deny that, Laszlo.  I'm a producer.  I make things happen.  Yeah.  Sometimes that trouble results in award-winning productions.  You know, do me a favor.  Stop with the Pepsi fucking zero, whatever this fucking thing is.  He was, he's in here yesterday.  He went through three of them.  And I hadn't had any lunch and I was bugging. 
[00:39:30]  You just wanted Diet Pepsi.  Sit down.  Please.  Sit down.  Stop the House of Bugging.  Sit down.  House of Bugging is already fucking done.  It was 845.  Were you really?  Yeah.  I've got a sort of.  Now, Than was just telling us that this is a time travel game.  Yeah.  That you do.  Why is it a time travel game?  Because you go back to 1947.  Yeah.  Am I crazy?  Does this one not feel like the big work that we've done in the past?  And you and I have been involved in a lot of these projects. 
[00:40:00]  I've been V.O.ing.  Well, this is.  I didn't know this was a Laszlo Bennington production of L.A. Noire.  There's no problem.  This is the first time my character didn't have a name.  No.  I was just.  Oh, boy.  Well, no wonder he's.  And now he doesn't give you a name and then he comes on O&A and I won't even repeat what  he said.  Why are you going to.  Seriously, why do you have to fucking disrespect me on fucking.  It was.  It was more Opie, really.  But we were.  We were talking about how.  What a great producer you are.  And that you're.  You know, you sort of pull strings and you make things happen.  You make comedy. 
[00:40:30]  No.  No.  I want.  I want to get to the fucking bottom of this.  Aren't you supposed to be on the air right now?  I am on the air.  Where the fuck do you see me?  Yeah, they haven't.  I tried.  I tried.  But let's go over this.  Let's go.  Look at me.  He's fucking just dousing.  He loves diet Pepsi so much.  And I want to find out your real name because this has gotten too fucking far with the Laszlo  stuff and everybody wants to rule the world.  And I get it.  Real genius.  But let's fucking get to the. 
[00:41:00]  You're in here yesterday.  You annoyed Fez.  How?  Oh, I know.  So Fez is gone.  And I have this fantasy about meeting the right person.  And Laszlo immediately goes, hey, do you jerk off?  What do you think about it?  That's going to make anyone uncomfortable.  You know, right.  But basically, all this stuff that.  And Fez got upset with it.  I mean, it's right.  And Laszlo somehow got that in his mind.  And how would I have singled, singled, singled, signaled Fez or done anything to say, Fez, this 
[00:41:30]  is something for you to start overreacting about.  Puppeteered.  But normally, when you're in this room, everything is fair game and you bring stuff up and everybody  talks about it.  But for some reason.  First of all, Fez is not like everybody else.  We know.  You know.  But you act like that just fucking happened.  Or Fez, you know, Fez is the same Fez that he's been for like five years.  So do you ever say, do you ever hear us going like that to Fez? 
[00:42:00]  Hey, when you jerk off, what do you think of?  Tom Selleck?  No one says that to him.  So he immediately got upset.  But he gets upset at a lot of stuff.  I can't be responsible for that.  Well, I know that you're not responsible for it, but why am I?  He's your partner.  You did say that Ron was puppeteering.  You said he was puppet master.  But he has to.  And then you said he was full of shit.  What am I full of shit about?  Just tell me what I'm full of shit.  I'm not saying you're full of shit.  You did say that.  Why are you going back on this?  You push.  Does this work?  No.  You push buttons. 
[00:42:30]  What fucking buttons do I push?  You're in the button pushing business.  I'm not making a time travel fucking video game.  For two months, you can't seem to bother to remember that his dad is dead.  Whoa.  And you constantly push his buttons about that.  And finding money fucking flowing down the street.  And you think it's his dead dad's ghost.  And Patrick Swayze's there.  What did that have to do with him?  Does he get angry at me for that?  Well, it's...  What I do...  Fez and I have a relationship.  I will tell you this. 
[00:43:00]  Fez is completely destroyed that his dad has passed away.  Rather than jump into that world with him, I keep it light and remind him that all humans are fucking fragile.  And to quote George Harrison, all things must pass.  This is as old as fucking the planet is to make fun of the things that we have no control over.  So, he feels so heavy about this that I add lightness. 
[00:43:30]  Now, what I don't do is go like this.  Hey, Fez, what do you think about when you jerk off?  You don't think that keeps it light?  That fucking...  We're just keeping it light.  That's what freaked him out because he felt fucking exposed.  And this is why you have problems getting women.  And first of all, he talks very inappropriate to women.  He did it yesterday with Laura.  What did he say?  He says that...  And you know Laura from the talent department.  Of course.  Wonderful person.  She's a girl next door.  Yeah.  He says that he blasts the air conditioning to make her nipples fucking hard. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, Laz.  Wait, we just called him Laz?  Laz.  Yeah.  That's the nickname.  So, there is two different instances of sexual harassment.  One with a woman, one with a male.  That's incredible.  And then he said you were full of shit.  That's crazy.  You said I was full of shit.  I didn't say you were full of shit, but what I will say is how is your fucked up partner  Opie or I's problem fucked up?  Whoa.  I never said that it was.  I never said that it was.  I feel like I can come in here and ask another man what he thinks about masturbating. 
[00:44:30]  No, no, no.  Let's fucking get into this.  Because I feel like if Opie talks to Fez or you talk to Fez, that's fucking fair game.  But I never accused either of you guys of anything.  Fez got angry with you.  Fez cried with Opie.  But I didn't give him the fucking signal, now's the time to cry.  What I did say to Opie, when Fez left, Opie had apologized to him a bunch. 
[00:45:00]  And then I said to Fez, I said to Opie, I go, he doesn't mean it.  Opie said that made him feel bad when you said that.  I'm sorry.  Two things.  Number one, I wanted him to know the truth.  Number two, what I said to him was in confidence.  And that's...  He broadcast it.  He broadcast it.  Literally.  So now I know how that works, you know?  I guess the mics are never off in this business, are they?  And then Laszlo was like, yeah, that guy's full of shit.  Something like that.  You're going to be great to see Fan.  Laszlo, you and I now are in a fucking... 
[00:45:30]  We have our own fucking beef.  How do we have a beef?  Honestly, the reason that I asked Fez that question is because I was thinking,  if you haven't had sex, what do you think about when you masturbate?  Because most men will go through the Rolodex of disasters.  Sure.  And decent chicks that they've been with.  And you sort of go through those while you spank it.  So I wanted to know, since he hasn't been with a woman,  what do you think about when masturbating?  I think that's a legitimate question. 
[00:46:00]  Did I say that it wasn't one?  Why are you mad at me?  And why do you and I have a beef?  Because you went on ONA and fucking blamed me for his reaction.  Ron's saying it's not Ron's fault that Fez was uncomfortable with that,  whereas you said he's a puppeteer and full of shit.  I think that you had every right to ask him that question.  I think he also had every right to go,  none of your fucking business, Laszlo.  And I went back on with his story.  Right.  But instead of doing that, he got upset.  And I only remember what Opie made him cry about.  Might have been saying something... 
[00:46:30]  I don't remember.  It was a very in-depth conversation about what Batman character.  And evidently that means tears are going to fly.  What Batman character would you be, I think, was the question.  So you were listening that day, or...?  No, I heard.  Like everything around here, it was hearsay.  I heard.  So what you need to do is like,  oh, Opie cares about this, so let me fall in behind him.  Let me march fucking lockstep.  It's really about what show I'm on at the time, you see? 
[00:47:00]  Now I'm on your side.  Well, technically, this is still my show.  Technically, just so everybody's...  Well, it's Stan's show.  Stan can come first.  Let's get back to Stan.  Did you guys talk about how he kicked Stan to the curb in their show together?  Well, we went over this and...  We discussed.  Told him how we heard.  Stan was saying that he's confused about the new game,  that why there's no rockets in it,  why there isn't any of the fun that we've had in the past.  Yeah, sort of the futuristic robots.  Yeah.  Lasers.  There's no robots, or is there some kind of Easter egg where we can get to a spaceship? 
[00:47:30]  Some kind of 1947 robotic car or something?  No, it's just a straightforward crime thriller.  Oh.  I want then to answer this question.  Okay.  Now, you've been here for the whole thing.  You saw the way he lied to Opie,  now you see the way he's lying to me.  Oh, no.  The important thing is this.  This is your boss, by the way, there.  Yeah, I know.  But let's just get into this, and I'll talk to you as a peer.  I like that.  If Fez gets upset, how am I puppeteering that? 
[00:48:00]  I don't understand it myself.  Perhaps you fueled the fire?  No, I think that you could go over and talk to your boss  and fucking say, did I even...  I didn't...  I let those two people have an uncomfortable conversation.  I just left it alone.  But there's a reason when I have celebrity guests  that we have decided Fez will leave the room during that  because it becomes uncomfortable for him.  He doesn't know what to say. 
[00:48:30]  He can't hear people, and they don't understand him.  And if you wanted Fez to be uncomfortable,  you would say, why don't you stay in the room  and do a little puppeteering?  Right.  But instead, you say, why don't you leave  and make yourself more comfortable?  The last person that he stayed in the room for  is he tried something when we were talking  with Michael Ian Black.  And that made Fez really hurt.  And I said, well, then you don't have to do it anymore.  Well, we had him on the phone, and we were all having fun. 
[00:49:00]  He leaves the studio and you have phone guests?  Yeah, we were all having fun, and we were throwing things in.  And then Fez is like, this is great.  And we're all laughing.  So Fez threw in a line, and then Michael Ian Black said,  wait a minute, what are you even talking about?  What is that supposed to mean?  And Fez's head hit the fucking thing.  Well, that's going to make anyone feel bad.  Yeah.  So we've given them that thing of, you don't have to be around with it.  Did Michael Ian Black get pissed at you because you made Fez get upset?  No.  First of all, he's not Laszlo.  He's going to fucking treat me like a fucking man. 
[00:49:30]  He's not going to invent things for his own comfortability.  When did I get on Ronnie B's shit list?  When you said he was full of shit.  When I came in here and I heard from Sam that you said that Ronnie B is full of shit.  And I thought, well, yesterday I was so happy to have Laszlo in here.  Invited him into the end of the show.  At the end I go like this.  Laszlo, why don't you just stop back when you're not promoting a time travel game.  That's nice.  You just fucking come in and hang out and do radio like the old days when you were at K-Rock.  Technophile shit.  You're going to listen to this attention whore? 
[00:50:00]  Hey, all you have to do is look at the tape.  That's the worst thing you can call a person, by the way.  Attention whore?  Isn't it?  I don't know.  I thought it would be like attention whore.  I'm talking to you.  All you have to do is pull up the tape.  You just set it on broadcast.  This is not hearsay.  It really fucking hurts me.  You said Ron Bankton is full of shit on the air.  I mean, you know, what am I going to make up about that?  Well, we're all getting sucked into this fez vortex.  I think that's why we're at each other here.  This is like a reality show where we've got to...  I don't doubt that.  I'm not the problem and you're not the problem. 
[00:50:30]  I don't doubt that.  And I'm fine with, you know, with whatever you guys fucking think.  But you guys act like Fez is not a real person doing his own stuff.  And that's stunning to me.  That'd be like me saying, oh, Sam got Than to fucking throw away a great radio career and  start trying to make cases for a time traveling game.  I had one of those.  You make the cases?  Yes.  Cool.  Well, see, Than left to go become a comedian.  Yes.  Why don't you do one of your jokes for us? 
[00:51:00]  No.  Because I love jokes.  I love them.  It's just like being in the position where you're not a producer where you can just  say, no, I'm not going to do that.  Does this help the show?  I don't care.  Yeah.  I never, I don't ever remember him saying, let me jump in.  There's only one person that I, on the ONA thing that I see is I will do whatever ONA  need at any moment.  And that's E-Rock.  Yep.  Then how come he took a week off and went to the Bahamas while the show's on?  Then fuck him.  He's done to me.  He's done.  Is that where he is now?  He's in the Bahamas right now. 
[00:51:30]  He's at that place where you have fingered dolphins or whatever.  The good thing is, normally, when he comes back up there, he always has cigars from  him.  Anytime he sees his dad, he comes back with cigars.  He knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  The Ricky Gervais picture, it's starting to kind of wear thin, so he's got to bring in  some cigars.  You know, he's a thoughtful guy.  I guess so.  He really is a thoughtful guy.  His bribery is thoughtfulness.  That's a word.  See, and I actually, I don't, I don't, you know, Eric.  You don't like E-Rock.  The sex bagel.  We still call him that.  Oh, good. 
[00:52:00]  You haven't missed anything.  He's still a sex bagel.  Yeah, it's pretty much like, speaking of time travel, it's like I haven't been gone  a day.  Not a single thing has changed.  But let's get...  No, the studio's smaller and the management hates them more.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't know if it would be more, but at least the same.  Now, but let's get something straight.  Yeah.  My handle is sex bagel on CompuServe.  So, don't get, if you're on CompuServe and you think you're talking to E-Rock, no, I'm  sex bagel on there.  Sex bagel was your least favorite staff member if you had to rank them, correct? 
[00:52:30]  I mean, there's no need to dredge stuff up, but yes.  Okay.  I mean, and he knows it.  We didn't invite each other to our respective weddings.  Yeah, but E-Rock didn't invite Travis or Danny either.  Oh, well.  D-Boy, he didn't come.  I invited everybody but Eric to my wedding.  Okay.  You know, so I mean, it was...  Why do you guys all fucking hate each other?  I tolerate Sam.  I almost got swept up in the moment and said I love Sam.  Yeah.  But Travis was my best man. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, like...  Travis is the coolest.  Yeah.  You like Travis?  Yeah.  But Eric and I just got into it because I didn't like his work ethic.  Are you not a Travis guy?  No, no, no.  I get along fine with everybody, but once...  If I were to leave the show, I don't know if I would have relationships with anyone who works here.  Well, no one does.  No, men don't do that.  Okay.  When you're...  Men have to be doing something together to have a relationship. 
[00:53:30]  Okay.  Well, yeah.  That would...  I'm fine with everybody.  Docking.  Well, you're like, oh, let's build a barn or let's, you know, let's start dealing coke.  But then when you're not doing something like that, you're like, I don't... I'm not going  to call you on the phone.  Yeah.  You know?  No, I'm not a not a Travis guy.  I've always liked Travis fine.  Why don't you rank?  Who's your favorite?  Top to bottom.  All right.  Doesn't mean that you hate anyone.  Doesn't mean that you love anyone.  Right.  I would go number one, probably Roland. 
[00:54:00]  I really get along with Roland.  He's a funny guy.  By the way, I see Roland...  This is the Puppet Master shit I was talking about.  He's stirring trouble.  Ron is?  Hold his shit.  Am I falling into it?  As soon as you and I are on the fucking page again, you fucking restart this.  Thank you, Lazlo.  You're like...  You're right.  You were trying to get me to say something I'd regret.  Your co-workers from awesome to I hate and want to get in a fight with.  No, and I know, I even said, it doesn't mean that you hate anyone, but the ONA staff is  definitely in camps, and I've never seen a fucking staff ever bother to do that before. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  You know?  I've never saw it happen with another radio show.  And, Thane, you will attest, it is still, and actually more so than when you left, a  venomous and toxic place to be at all times.  Why?  Another reason I left.  Well, there's just a lot of negativity and anger towards everything.  There's not a lot of team.  Nothing.  There is no team.  Nobody is happy to be anywhere.  Hey, this is interesting.  I'm glad this came up.  A scientist, and oddly enough, working alone, okay? 
[00:55:00]  This guy is out by himself, working out of Iceland.  He has, it's a thing that is like a microscope, but it's also a telescope.  So we can actually see very small things, but in space.  And he has found out that there is an iron team.  And isn't that fucking amazing?  Wow.  After all these years?  I had no idea.  So why do you guys all, because you all hated Steve, and you hated, you guys hated Steve?  I didn't hate Steve as a human being. 
[00:55:30]  You just hated him as a boss.  Oh, yes.  As you've been doing.  Oh, this is really...  Yeah, I mean, as a boss, yeah, for sure.  This is not going to end well, this conversation.  Well, it didn't even start all that great.  No, it really didn't.  Yeah, I mean, no, we all, none of us liked the work that Steve did, and maybe...  But none of you like...  Danny hates everybody.  True.  Travis hates everybody.  You hate everybody.  Yeah.  Than is saying that everybody hated each other.  You're supposed to be focusing on making a good radio show.  Yeah, but who is the guy? 
[00:56:00]  There has to be, at every team, there's a coach that brings everyone together.  We don't have that.  We don't have central leaders.  There is nobody that says, hey, let's get all the O&A staff, and let's all go out for  burgers.  Is that a problem of the lack of coach, or do you think you as players wouldn't respond  to a coach?  Well, we've been...  Yeah, you all have trouble with authority.  We've been six years deep without a coach, so we wouldn't know how to respond.  Well, who should be the coach, in your opinion?  You mean, like, the head producer?  And I'm unfortunately otherwise employed, but go ahead. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Well, I mean, they got weird about the head producer thing after Steve left, and when Steve  was here, he was a disaster.  So that didn't work.  Steve was a nice guy.  He was a nice guy.  That's why I said I didn't like...  But he wasn't...  If you worked for him, you wouldn't be saying that.  And then, whether it's...  Oh, this is venom.  Whether it's, you know, somebody above the producer, whether it's whoever.  There is nobody.  So, but they're above the producer.  You're taking, like, little shots at O&A here, like, why aren't they doing anything?  Because I'll tell you, they're on the air right now. 
[00:57:00]  They're not on the air right now.  No, but I mean, during the fucking show, they're on the air.  But there's not just O&A, because there's also levels of management beyond producer.  So who would that be?  Oh, wow, now you're throwing the management under the bus.  I'd rather throw management under the bus than O&A.  What are you saying?  Steve Blatter should fucking push away the other 80 radio stations?  Steve Blatter has a lot on his plate.  All I'm saying is somebody who's in charge, because, listen, Sam Roberts, you can check  pay stubs.  It's bottom of the totem pole to this day.  No, but the thing is, that doesn't mean that this thing that you say is missing, that 
[00:57:30]  you couldn't be the step-up guy.  You could be the step-up guy.  But I can't, in my position, talk to everybody who's ranked above me by title and paycheck  and say, all right, guys, I'm leading the pack.  Let's all go out to lunch.  And they'd say, well, who's paying for it?  And I'd say, I don't have the money for it.  So who is going to be the guy?  But I can't stand anyone who brings up, like, problems but doesn't think that they're  part of the solution.  And I think that's why Sam walked out on the Sam and Thans show. 
[00:58:00]  You think so?  I could work very well with the group.  And I consistently do stuff for the show.  And I'm all the time trying to make a better radio show.  But...  No, I don't know if I agree with that.  Because the weekends, it's not the best of O&A.  It's the best of when I came in and my mommy was on.  And it's just, you know...  You despise the weekend programming.  You were telling me that before.  Well, I don't know if I...  You said it's unlistenable because...  It's never about O&A.  And it's always about the producer. 
[00:58:30]  I've challenged anyone to come to any given weekend and say what bit was left out.  And they've never come to the table with it.  That's a great challenge.  Anyone.  You ought to come up with a bag of money.  $10,000.  Any one of you ham and eggers think you can step into the ring.  That's right.  But the weird thing about radio is that it's the only job where you can sit and slag off  your bosses and not really get fired.  Because if you worked at McDonald's and walked up to the register and was like, you know,  can I get a Big Mac?  And this place fucking sucks. 
[00:59:00]  The management stinks.  But see, can I tell you the difference?  The difference is this.  If you go into McDonald's, the manager knows how to make a hamburger.  And I don't mean that just about here.  But there is no radio station that I've ever worked in that the fucking boss knows how to  walk down the hall and entertain people.  They just don't know how to do it.  And all those guys, particularly talk radio, they got into it because they like radio. 
[00:59:30]  You know what I mean?  So they're just like, yeah, I love radio.  When I was a kid, I used to listen.  But the guys that are on the air never used to listen to anyone.  They didn't give a fuck.  They're just being themselves with a mic in front of them.  And they don't know how to go and take another show and say, here's what you got to do to  make good radio and make any sense out of it.  But why, at every station or satellite network, are the guys that were selling commercials 
[01:00:00]  to use car dealers and titty bars in charge of the creative content?  It doesn't make sense.  Can I tell you something?  Go into a Hollywood studio.  It's the same thing.  They don't get Martin Scorsese to run his fucking studio.  Sales runs every corporation in America.  Every fucking one.  It doesn't matter where you go.  Everybody comes out of sales because they only worry about the money for the next quarter.  And there's not a company out there that worries about product and making a great product. 
[01:00:30]  Rockstar Games has a great product coming out a week from today.  Is it though?  All right.  How many lasers are in it?  But Ron, if you have a small staff, it's like if the two of them don't get along.  They don't.  They don't.  Mark Zito?  Is he allowed to go on the air?  I don't know.  He doesn't want to be on the air.  He says, I'm not a great.  He says, this is what he ended up saying to, and I got this from the bus.  He goes, I'm a top 40 guy on a heavy metal station.  And I go, well, A, we're not a fucking heavy metal station. 
[01:01:00]  No.  And B, top 40 blows.  Well, I'm on both.  So if you could.  What are you counting down this weekend on your show?  Well, I don't do the weekend countdown.  That's Spider Harrison.  Why is top 40 constantly counting?  Because you got to keep the people listening.  I would listen to the next song.  But why do numbers?  Why do numbers make anybody listen?  Because there's a thing that people want to know what's number one.  What is number one?  Then why am I concerned with number nine?  No, but you ever notice that a rock station doesn't go, what's the number one rock song? 
[01:01:30]  How many rock stations are there in New York?  Boom.  So you're saying that the point that all comes on the counting.  That's right.  That's why kids have turned their back on.  Americans like a list.  You know what's on iTunes?  Top 40.  What's the top list of things selling?  And that's what's selling.  Everybody loves a list.  You say that.  Mm-hmm.  And if we went back and said the 90s, what's the 90s about, right?  Yeah.  And let's do the music of the 90s, we would never go to Top 40 radio. 
[01:02:00]  And you don't do that in the 60s.  You don't do that in the 70s.  So we'd make a list.  You're saying you don't think Dishwalla is iconic for the 1990s music?  Look, I count it blue cars just like everyone else.  Do you know, I'm glad you said Dishwalla because one time I had to bring them out on stage.  And I'm not kidding.  It was some fucking kind of thing.  And I looked out and there was nothing but fucking chairs.  And they're going, you want to bring them out?  And I go like this, why? 
[01:02:30]  Why don't they just stay back there and fucking drink beer?  No, people are coming.  I go, all right.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Dishwalla.  I couldn't even make eye contact with them.  I love that there are people calling in now and everybody's got their own theory on which  individual Opie and Anthony staff member is to blame for the lack of morale.  I'm glad to hear that.  One says me.  One says Danny.  Yeah.  It's got to be one of the two of us.  I mean, it wasn't me. 
[01:03:00]  Apparently not.  I left the show and, you know, things, you know.  But your life went to shit after you left the show.  Did it really?  I literally found him on a bridge sweating, the Manhattan Bridge.  And I said, how are things going?  And he was.  I said, can I have a job?  And I said, can I have a job?  And so, you know, he was literally running in circles across the Brooklyn, you know, through  Manhattan, over the Manhattan Bridge.  Was there a lot of pity in the hire?  There wasn't a lot of pity. 
[01:03:30]  The problem is, fans on Xbox Live till two in the morning said, you know, you can actually  do this for a living, so he came in for three weeks, freelance, and captured some amazing  shots for Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare.  That was a big one.  Everyone loved that game.  And so we were like, well, maybe we should hire this guy.  And you did.  Yeah.  I come in and I make myself indispensable, Sam.  You dominate.  That's the only way you know how.  Unless it's the Fan at Sam show.  Right. 
[01:04:00]  Just rage out.  It doesn't matter.  The great thing about your job is one of the few jobs you could actually smoke weed.  Yeah.  That's why it's fucking going on.  Well, I mean.  Do you remember when we could smoke in your office?  Do you remember those days?  I used to smoke on the air in fucking Florida.  We used to smoke cigars on the air and not even think about it.  And that's just our show, every show.  You'd just be like, all right, everybody, welcome.  And we would have a bar in there.  It was a fucking very relaxing atmosphere.  Everything's changed.  There would be callers that would call up and go like this.  Are you going home after the show and you say, yeah, and they go, look, you're a little 
[01:04:30]  fucked up.  Why don't you just sleep on your couch for a while?  Yeah.  They tried to do that here, I think, for like two months back when they came back to satellite  O&A.  Oh, with the Jaeger machine and all that?  Yeah.  Didn't.  Wasn't a good scene.  It lasted about four weeks.  It wouldn't have been allowed in here anyway, so it's all for the best.  Well, they nearly killed a girl.  I know we're not supposed to talk about that.  I don't know anything about that.  Then don't.  This is the thing.  Like the way you say they nearly killed a girl, the way you say Ron Bennington is full 
[01:05:00]  of shit, you forget there are microphones in front of you.  I've noticed in this, here's the difference between me and Opie.  Why did I immediately go in, no, I'm going to spare O&A any fucking problems?  Opie would have been like, tell me more about Ron Bennington being a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Instead of being like, this is the weird thing.  I guess it's not a two-way street, this relationship.  That's a shame because he was just building.  He was building.  It was just, you know, he'd come on this show.  Where's Fezzy and the Talking Cat?  Oh.  See, again, this is what makes him fucking feel awkward around you. 
[01:05:30]  No, he shouldn't.  It was great hearing you say the word cookie for an hour and a half straight.  Oh, that sounded sarcastic to me.  Do you think that Fez is going to like you because of that?  He doesn't like me now.  He never did like me.  That is too small of a word to use.  What?  He hates you.  Wow.  And he's hated before.  You don't want to get...  I would never want to be on Fez's bad side.  I think you should apologize.  I think planet Earth is on Fez's bad side.  How am I the bad guy?  But why when we're all just sitting here having a fun conversation, you have to turn it into 
[01:06:00]  a negative, number one, bringing up some fucking lie rumor that isn't even true about  ONA, and then two, bringing up about a show that Fez did that didn't go necessarily  well.  It was a show about a talking cat.  Well, it wasn't a talking cat.  If that cat would have talked, it would have went fucking viral.  And you know it, and I know it, and we...  You would have bet today's show.  Today's show.  I don't know how it happened, Meredith, and we're going to miss you.  They made the announcement today that Meredith's leaving.  I read that. 
[01:06:30]  Didn't seem like that big of a deal.  You know, all the things that used to be big are leaving us.  Like, if you hosted the Today Show, that used to be a giant job, no matter who did it.  If you were hosting the Tonight Show, gigantic.  Things don't mean anything anymore.  And it's because video games are so much more entertaining now, people aren't watching  television.  Yeah, like Elaine Roth coming out next week.  Is that the one that doesn't have helicopters in it?  There are no helicopters in this game?  Uh, no.  There's not a lot of helicopters in the 47. 
[01:07:00]  Why didn't you do a hunt for bin Laden?  That would have been the fucking game.  That's a game.  Yeah.  That is a game.  I don't want to spoil anything.  Why don't you do Sealed Team 6, but with real seals?  You know how they're always having, like, fun fucking things in those games?  That's not fun.  It could be like an iPhone game.  They're always having fun until they get eaten by a killer whale.  That could be part of the thing.  That could be it.  Ron, you seem to know a lot about this Sealed Team 6.  Not really. 
[01:07:30]  It's weird that you bring them up just like that, because...  Officially, they don't even exist, Sam.  As far as I know.  Are you going to start your show, or...  Yeah, it's already 11.30.  It's 11.30.  And are we good?  Me and you, are we...  No, no.  We're seriously not fucking good.  You're going on vacation, and you're going to come back and do my show?  Yes.  I want to fucking seriously fucking settle this thing.  I'll tell you the difference between me and Opie and Fez.  I don't like it when people talk behind my back. 
[01:08:00]  Is it the full of shit thing?  Yeah, it's the full of shit thing that you brought up to me.  That, to me, is crossing a line.  Yeah.  But you're believing Sam.  Listen to the replay.  I do believe Sam.  3 p.m. Eastern.  By the way, Sam, have you noticed something?  Because I know you like the gossip a little bit.  Love it.  And you're best friends with Rowan.  Best friends.  Do you notice that there's a female that he spends quite a bit of time with now?  I mean...  Down to lunch, even?  Down to lunch?  I didn't see this.  Mm-hmm.  Quite a bit of time. 
[01:08:30]  Wait, can you mention her name or write it down?  What color hair?  See, there's a problem.  I don't know everyone's name in this fucking place.  So you're not being mysterious.  No, I think her name is Shady45.  Is she a brunette?  Yeah.  I know who you're talking about.  I think.  But I saw him bring back bags of lunch for both of them the other day.  Is that the intern?  Is it the intern?  No.  I met some hottie out in the hall in front of Shade45.  Oh, no.  That's not who Rowan's into it.  Is it Shade45 or Shady? 
[01:09:00]  It's Shade45.  You know we started doing Shady45.  Eastside Dave got everybody saying Shady45.  Dave has fucked me up with everything.  Yeah.  It's Shade45.  By the way, I'm going to win my 17 bet against him.  And he's already trying to double down.  Does he know what that means?  Because he wasn't good with double or nothing.  But I'll tell you this.  Motherfucker better pay me the 17 bucks.  What do we need to do to get him back on the show?  Do we have a fundraiser or something?  Yeah, make a rock star game about it.  Get Dave back on.  Well, no.  I brought him in the studio with real actors and he screamed so loud. 
[01:09:30]  Everybody threw their headphones off their head and said,  Where did you get this lunatic?  Is that it for his video game career?  I don't know.  He's betting Oklahoma City comes back and wins the series.  He wants to double down.  And you're the bookie, right?  I guess.  I didn't know you had a business.  I'm a bookie with just one client.  Well, look.  Speaking of business, do you want to start your show?  I'd like to figure out everything we're doing with Sam first.  It's half past the hour.  If you have any more questions, I'm right here, Ron.  Is there any way to get you and Sam back on the air? 
[01:10:00]  Back to fucking just finally seeing whether that show had chemistry or not?  Listen.  What is it?  He was doing a motion like a puppeteer.  All right, motherfucker.  Wow.  And you actually had your back turned to it.  You literally had your back to him and he was talking about you.  That's right.  That seems to be the theme for today.  Listen, Ron, I don't think that Eastside Dave, somebody who you're not only close with,  but who you have a business with at this point.  I consider him blood.  Yeah.  I don't think he would like that you were coming on and trying to reunite.  But he's doing that other sports show with Chris Stanley and that thing's kicking ass. 
[01:10:30]  So you think I've got to find something.  Everybody needs a lot of shows.  What do you mean you've never heard of it?  Never heard of it.  They do a sports show?  It's the big Eastside country with Dave and Mack.  It's a podcast.  Oh, it's a podcast.  It's not on the channel.  Because Rob says no.  We actually found out from the Sports Grumblings guys who do a show at the same time as me  and Eastside Dave that Dave likes to go on their show and destroy the show, like ruin  it.  Like he'll say things that are not entertaining on purpose. 
[01:11:00]  And so then we found out that, and that has a lot to do with it, the sports department  doesn't like Eastside Dave.  And that's where he wanted to be.  That's where he wanted to put his podcast in.  Do you and Dave get paid to do the Saturday Night Show?  Rephrase your question.  Rephrase your question.  And or or.  I'll rephrase it to this.  Do you want to know why we don't do the Laszlo show on Saturday nights anymore?  I'll give you a hint.  Eastside Dave gets paid to do the show.  Because he is not a full-time employee. 
[01:11:30]  He is a part-time.  Sam Roberts does not get paid.  Well, sure you do.  It just comes out of the same pot.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  I should be a manager.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, our show was just a success.  Was it?  I don't want to rule.  I get people to this day.  Who've never heard of it.  Who've never heard of it.  No, but co-workers at Rockstar download the shows and listen to them and say that they're  very entertaining.  They're not topical anymore.  I know.  I mean, the stuff we were talking about is way out of time. 
[01:12:00]  Survivor.  Yeah.  Everybody.  If you don't have at least 15 minutes dedicated to it.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, maybe Eastside Dave, if I said, Dave, from now on, we're going to do special  delivery every other week.  And then on the odd weeks, I'll bring Than in and do something with him.  That would actually be kind of cool.  Because that really worked with Van Halen.  And then they brought back David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar.  You don't think it's a good idea then?  Did they ever have them both at the same time?  Yeah.  Didn't they have a show?  No.  They opened with one.  They did a reunion tour.  They were going back and forth.  I had no idea of this.  Definitely. 
[01:12:30]  You're right.  And they flipped a coin.  And they took turns opening and closing.  But it lasted like three shows or something.  Right.  How did I miss that?  It lasted three shows.  But yeah.  I mean, I guess now that you bring up the Van Halen thing, the Than and Sam special delivery  weekend lineup might be a bit of a conflict of interest.  It's out there.  You'd be willing to do it.  Oh, yeah.  Sam, he's willing to do it.  I've got to talk to Eastside Dave.  You're not your own man now, Sam.  Oh, shit! 
[01:13:00]  What happened?  I left you a proud, willful young boy.  And now you're just a shell of a man.  Well, Sam was hurt, and justifiably so.  I said it was shitty when I started doing a show with Dave without even mentioning it to him.  Wow, that's pretty shitty.  That's pretty shitty, right?  But had you stopped doing the show with him?  No.  That's fucking shitty.  He's basically like, how's it taste?  It was disgusting.  But now, if I said, all right, I don't want to do that again to another person.  Like, I'm not going to do that to Dave, right? 
[01:13:30]  Well, fucking good for him.  I'm glad you've turned yourself around for that piece of shit.  Whoa!  He's not a piece of shit.  He's a good guy.  And I mean, you know.  That's all you're going to give?  That's all you're going to give?  He's a great guy.  But I mean, seriously.  You're not even offended.  You kicked him to the curb for another woman.  But here's what kills me.  Dave's a man.  And this is what a lot of people do.  He blames Dave.  You know, Fan is blaming Dave, going, Dave a piece of shit.  It's not the other woman.  Dave had nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  It's not the other woman.  It's Sam.  Yeah.  And people will do that. 
[01:14:00]  Like, oh, you see the horror that he's...  That's not the fucking woman's fault.  Now, was this because when you got married and you and Lily settled down and you started  a family...  Oh, I thought you married Lily.  No, we ended up different paths.  I didn't know that.  You went out with Lily, didn't you?  Sure.  Well, they just swap women on these shows, don't they?  I tried.  That's sort of why I didn't want to keep doing that.  Oh, so now you're saying other people slept with Lily?  No.  No.  I don't know anything about that.  I just didn't want...  I just didn't want...  It's shit where you eat. 
[01:14:30]  It's just a bad idea.  They're two adults and they tried something and they moved on from each other.  Yeah.  Doesn't mean that we can't be friends with both of them.  Thanks, Ron.  Now, how many dates did you go on with Lily?  One.  One.  Okay, that's what I thought.  It seemed like it was special.  They tried something.  It was called dinner and it failed.  Yeah.  Well.  What was it about you that she didn't like?  No, I didn't.  See, that's assuming that she left you.  Yeah.  Wow.  Whereas...  I just didn't click. 
[01:15:00]  You didn't like her?  Too dumb.  Was that what it was?  Too dumb?  No.  What a horrible way to...  It seemed like you know something we don't.  No, I'm just asking.  I asked questions.  She's definitely not dumb.  She's not a dumb person.  I've always been fond of Lily.  Let's go back to how hurt Than was when he was replaced.  That really...  That is a shitty fucking thing.  Yeah, I told him.  I took...  I said it was shitty of me to do that.  Why did you do it?  Did you just thought that the Sam and Than thing wasn't happening?  I thought that Than wasn't around.  I'm going to get you a card or something. 
[01:15:30]  Why is that?  Just so you can remember the name of the show.  It's okay.  He's very proud that his name on this show that failed was first.  But you never...  Do you ever know, like in Sam and Dave, that Sam is one of those names that's a leading  name?  Yeah.  It just works that way.  I agree.  I just don't want people to get confused.  It's like Ron.  Get nostalgic.  Go to SamandThan.com and see nothing.  You know, but they see...  I just got hit with a stupid network solutions bill for another year.  Did you re-up?  Yeah.  Well, I did it automatically.  And I'm like, oh, I've got to cancel that thing. 
[01:16:00]  But yet you don't.  I know.  Because there's a little glimmer of hope and Ronnie is here to bring that hope back.  He's trying to get the reunion tour going.  If you just get off the meds.  I know the other day that Dave skipped your show and went to a wedding.  Yeah.  He didn't...  I mean, he had to go to a wedding.  I've had a miss show.  But why didn't you invite Sam in that night?  The place wouldn't have went crazy.  Because I didn't want to do that to Dave.  Dave would have been mad about it?  I hate how you grew after you broke my heart.  Well, you got...  Oh, that's true.  I was young.  I like how you were... 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I was young.  I didn't know better then.  I was young.  It was two years ago.  Like two and a half years ago.  Oh, sorry.  And I've grown a lot in that time.  But I didn't want to do that to Dave.  And I can handle that on my own.  And I did.  Why don't we ask Dave?  He's not here.  Dave sleeps during the...  He's a morning guy.  But...  No, Sam left O&A.  And then we realized that we didn't have any reason to speak to each other when we weren't  working in the same place.  And then I was like, okay. 
[01:17:00]  And then Dave said, do you want to try doing a show?  And I said, yeah, why not?  I don't care.  I don't have any contracts.  Even though at the time you were still...  You had a social contract.  Yeah.  It's called friendship.  Well, I was doing a bi-monthly show with somebody who I spoke to also bi-monthly.  Did it feel more like...  I've...  ...than that to you then?  It felt like it was a nightly.  Yeah, I know.  Well, maybe you shouldn't have just...  Those were replays.  I just...  Those were taped shows.  I prepped for it like it was nightly, but...  That's nice.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Do you ever listen to Dave's show with Sam?  Uh, no.  It would hurt too much?  Yeah, I can't.  That's like listening to tapes of your old lady banging somebody else, you know?  I don't think any of those tapes exist for anyone, do they?  Unless you're with a porn star.  Unless you're a swinger, I guess.  That's exactly...  Driving down the road and I get to hear a tape of you.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if that ever comes up.  I just flip on my radio.  So you're that fond of Sam that just hearing him do a show is someone.  He was...  Sam told me during the interview when I hired him, he was so upset that he just cancels... 
[01:18:00]  How come no one's doing this while Laszlo talks?  Doing a little puppet gesture.  Ron doesn't talk about people like that.  I don't talk about people.  And, you know, it's one of those things that when you are a puppet master, you call other  people that.  Yeah.  Distract.  Deflect.  What were you saying?  Tell the lie.  About the interview.  Why did...  Well, he canceled his satellite radio service, right?  He couldn't even just...  He couldn't bear to listen to Sam's voice.  Well, I also didn't have a job.  It was kind of an extra expense I couldn't pick up, but... 
[01:18:30]  You miss great shows.  O&A shows.  I'm not trying to rub it in.  Special delivery was fine, too.  But, you know...  This is awkward.  Yeah.  It got weird.  I didn't know that...  Did you officially apologize for your poor handling of what happened?  Or you just said it was shitty?  I said it was shitty.  Yeah.  Was there an actual apology?  Sorry, I was shitty.  No, wow.  I mean, what do you mean?  I just admitted it was shitty.  That's what happens.  Well, it's just shitty.  It doesn't mean that you necessarily feel bad about it. 
[01:19:00]  But I'm not doing it again.  For instance, the Dave thing.  What do you mean you're not doing it again?  He just said if I wanted to...  Sorry, I punched you in the face, but I'm not going to punch the next person in the face?  Exactly.  I'm non-violent now.  No, but he just said, didn't it make you feel better that other people won't go through  the kind of pain that you did?  That gives me no satisfaction.  Here's the weird thing.  I was a big fan of the...  Than.  Thank you.  And Sam's show.  Thanks for the British accent.  Yet, I think Sam's the worst thing that ever happened to Dave.  Why?  Why do you say that so much?  It's just that you have one type of personality.  Dave, to me, is just big, and he's shooting around. 
[01:19:30]  And I really want him to either be with someone who flies with him or a real anchor that will  hold him.  But where you guys both were like, here's some...  You know what I mean?  That's not...  I don't know what you mean.  It's that fucking nerdy thing you guys do.  I think I agree.  I don't know what you mean.  Kind of cool.  Survivor.  Yeah.  We don't talk about Survivor.  We had an awesome show.  I don't know if anyone saw that Scott Pilgrim version.  versus the world, but it's really great.  We've never brought up Scott Pilgrim.  I've never seen the film.  I like wrestling, and you're married. 
[01:20:00]  We've brought that.  Star Wars.  No, Dave and me have a very good chemistry that's only gotten better at the time.  Dave is good.  There's no fucking doubt.  Listen, I'm good at what I do as well.  I'm confident in that.  Well, that's not the question.  Has anyone else ever told...  That's never been the problem.  My parents have.  They said, not only are you good with Dave, but you're great when you and Ronnie get together  and do your thing.  Your parents really seriously have what I call the golden ear.  They really like the Ronnie and Sammy sweetheart connection.  They love when Ron and Sam get together. 
[01:20:30]  They can't make you eat a steak like a man, though.  No, but they love...  What do you mean by that?  He doesn't eat steak.  Why not?  He doesn't eat adult food.  I thought we've covered this on every show.  Let's do it again, though.  I don't...  I have a limited palate.  I don't want you guys to leave, or else then I've got to fucking throw this stuff.  We're almost at the point where the after show is lasting as long as the show show.  That would be two hours.  So anyway, what were you saying about not eating steak?  He eats fucking fish sticks and pizza bites.  We've gone over it.  All the stuff that's going to kill him at 35 when he has diabetes. 
[01:21:00]  We spent a lot of time on it.  Both on O&A, special delivery, Sam, the after show.  You get a new audience every day, Sam.  Did we?  On satellite radio?  You should hope so.  You get some audience.  I think he's like...  It'd be better than nothing.  Sam is like that little kid in the Twilight Zone movie that could just fucking turn things  into cartoons and makes the adults eat bad food.  That's a good episode.  Take him away!  You want to start, Ryan Fez?  What's Fez been doing all this time?  Does Fez want to come in and join us? 
[01:21:30]  He's more...  Why do you ask me?  Everyone can talk to Fez directly.  Fez, wherever you are, if you'd like to come in and join us, you're more than welcome.  And if it would make you feel more comfortable, we will ask Laszlo to leave.  Because we're at this point, why don't we just end this?  Okay.  And I'll bring Fez in.  It got weird towards the end, didn't it?  Yeah.  And there's a great new game show out.  It doesn't have any of the special effects of the other games.  Okay.  Matter of fact, we even go backwards, right?  It's no cool...  It's not like a futuristic deal.  Yeah, no hip-hop music, no rock. 
[01:22:00]  You go back to jazz.  I don't know if there's a lot of kids out there who are Stan Kenton fans.  It's an educational game?  The L.A. Noire's got a lot of jazz in it.  Well, that's what we're talking about.  It's what we're fucking setting up.  Oh.  Yeah.  Like L.A. Noire.  But you called it a game show.  Is it video games aren't game shows?  They're technically game shows.  It's like a show because L.A. Noire is...  Burn it!  Burn it!  That's a great thing for Rockstar Games.  Maybe like a home version of the gong show or something.  Yeah.  Wow.  The great ideas keep coming.  Of course, Ron's referring to L.A. Noire. 
[01:22:30]  Doing all the soundtrack.  Coming out May 17th for Xbox and PlayStation 3.  No explosions.  No, there's explosions.  You can blow up cars and stuff.  But it's small explosions.  It's like a small fire site.  You can't blow up a planet in every game.  By their fireworks?  Fireworks?  It just seems like...  It's not a parade game.  Is the next one you're going to do be like a futuristic fun thing?  You're really into Space Marines in the future, aren't you?  Space Marines of the future.  Now, that's a game title.  You better write...  You better...  Somebody is going to get it. 
[01:23:00]  I think it's being done, and it has been done.  There's a fun thing here.  Some of the characters, you can take their shoes off and put on loafers.  That's great.  Like they used to in the past.  Wow.  There is a fun thing in this, and it's all about old L.A.  Well, like 1930s, 40s.  47, yeah.  And I'm playing a character that helps you ration gas.  And it's a step back, I think, isn't it?  It's like a fun step back.  When you're not catching murderers and arsonists, and yeah, I'm selling this game, Brian. 
[01:23:30]  I'm doing it.  I'm in the game.  Laszlo actually redid your character.  It's just a guy who's full of shit, convincing people to do stuff.  First of all, he gave me a character this time with no name at all, so...  I didn't get it.  He needed filler.  So when you're on the...  Oh!  I mean, that's not bad.  Ron Bennington is not filler.  The great Ron Bennington?  I've got a huge part for you.  I don't want to start by going with the pretty good Ron Bennington.  I've got a huge part for you in mind.  For what?  The space marines of the future? 
[01:24:00]  That's right.  Space marines of the future!  That sounds like a space marine.  You're the guy that speaks over the intercom and chastises them.  Look out!  Force field!  Force field!  Whoa!  That's a black hole!  Now this is satellite radio.  That's not fair, because you're clearly such a fan of the genre.  Anything that's not in that genre is going to seem not good to you.  That's true.  I don't even know what the word genre means, let alone be a fan of it.  Cookie?  Well, speaking of that, we should invite Fez in here.  Cookie?  Invite him. 
[01:24:30]  Invite his show.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  This has been...  It's Ron and Fez, noon to three.  No, it's like the old days.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  I loved it better, to tell you the truth.  I could sleep that extra hour.  Did you get an extra 25% raise with it?  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Boy, that's Super Agent Bobby even coming through.  Yeah, he does.  Laszlo, Ron Bennington, the great Ron Bennington, and of course, the returning fan.  It was great to see you again.  Thank you.  And you guys did have a terrific show, and I had no idea the way it ended, and it's... 
[01:25:00]  You didn't?  No, but it actually makes me like you a little less, Sam.  Oh, man.  And I wonder what kind of parents you had that raised you this way.  They like you.  I love them, but I guess they weren't attentive to the way that a person's supposed to treat  his friends.  Well, on that note...  By the way, your parents are going to love this new game, this L.A. Film Noir.  L.A. Film Noir.  Because it takes you back to yesteryear.  Yeah.  It's a simpler time.  Yeah.  It's not like... 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, it's like it actually was a very simple time, 1940s Los Angeles.  It was a very dark period in the 60s.  Well, we didn't have electricity yet.  Yeah.  This is one of the few...  Is there TV in this game?  No.  There's radio.  But yeah, but it's A.M.  All right.  Put on the A.M. radio and help me crank this car up.  That's it.  O.B. and Anthony, and after O.B. and Anthony return tomorrow, stay tuned.  And Ron and Fez is next. 
[01:26:00]  The O.B. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O.A. show on Facebook at facebook.com slash O.B. and Anthony.  And catch O.B. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  On the virus. </pre>
