<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about sports, specifically focusing on the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, and Jets. Opie and Anthony, along with guest Bill Burr (a Red Sox fan), debated team loyalties and mocked bandwagon fans.  Their conversation included humorous anecdotes about Vinny Testaverde's aging athletic performance, and observations on the behavior of fans at sporting events, including drunken antics and the futility of boycotts during player disputes.  Audio clips of Joe Namath and Vinny Testaverde were played.

The hosts then segued into a personal reminiscing segment, sharing explicit details about their early sexual experiences.  Opie recounted his first sexual encounter at 13, with Anthony offering similar, comparative anecdotes.

A significant portion of the show featured Steve-O, initially via phone. Steve-O described his recent, heavily intoxicated appearance on the Adam Carolla Show, recounting potentially violent behavior and unpredictable actions.  Audio clips from this appearance were played, showcasing his inebriated state and repeated use of "I don't play." He also mentioned a new television series he was developing.

Later, Steve-O appeared as a guest in the studio and read his "suicide note" on air. The note detailed his desire for a dramatic death before physical decline, referencing ODB and contrasting himself with Flava Flav.  He aired grievances against several celebrities, including Christian Slater, Sean "Diddy" Combs, and Johnny Knoxville (mentioning Knoxville's wife's firearm), and shared his views on Christianity.  His phone call dropped unexpectedly during the reading, leading to speculation about whether it was intentional.  After reconnecting, the conversation shifted to his upcoming vasectomy and other personal antics. He plugged his website, steveovideo.com, and engaged in sexually charged banter with the hosts.

The show then turned to a disastrous TV pitch meeting Opie and Anthony had with A&E for a show combining *Mythbusters* and *Jackass*. They recounted the lack of enthusiasm from A&E executives and the contradictory emails from the production company.  This led to humorous commentary and hypothetical absurd TV show concepts. The segment concluded with a pre-recorded "Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail" bit featuring a distressed mother reacting to her son's fabricated arrest. Bill Burr was noted as filling in for Jim Norton.

A further segment detailed a past business deal gone sour with a manager named Steve Russo, who pocketed most of the profits from CD and merchandise sales.  They recounted the confrontation where they received only a thousand dollars instead of the expected ten thousand each. This was followed by a discussion of a potentially lucrative new television deal with A&E, the overly enthusiastic emails from the new (and potentially substance-abusing) manager providing comedic fodder.  This section also included a failed prank phone call to a listener's mother; congratulatory messages from Mick Foley and Joe Rogan about XM Radio's subscriber milestone; a phone call with XM Radio's CEO, Elo, announcing a partnership with DirecTV; and a discussion about the Iraq War, punctuated with strong language and dark humor, including the recurring joke about turning Iraq into a parking lot.  The hosts also recounted other bad business dealings and frustrating encounters with agents and managers.

A later segment focused on the Iraq War, with Anthony expressing evolving opinions on the war's justification and a caller, Jared Jersey, disputing Anthony's claims.  Another caller, Tony from St. Louis, offered a more nuanced perspective.  The discussion included strong language and touched upon US casualty rates and the lack of a clear exit strategy. The conversation then shifted back to a heated sports debate between Opie and Bill Burr about the Yankees and Red Sox, with caller Scott Farrell participating. This was followed by playing clips from Tara Reid's appearance on a travel show, highlighting her intoxicated behavior and nonsensical comments about the Iraq War and terrorism, provoking mockery from the hosts.

Finally, the show played extended audio clips from Tara Reidâ€™s trip, detailing her behavior, including dancing on tables, a bizarre story involving a moat, TNT, and a rabbit, her reactions to various activities, and her demand for a separate hotel room for her shoes.  Her singing was compared to a female Joe Cocker, and her refusal to participate in activities like windsurfing and the Running of the Bulls was ridiculed.  The hosts, along with possibly Constantine, used vulgar and offensive language throughout this segment, which concluded with a promotion for Bill Burr.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm all right.  How are you?  I'm all right.  How are you?  I'm all right.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I would like to just get to know you. 
[00:05:00]  Let's go Yankees!  Ooh.  From the Mets fans.  Well, the Mets are done, you know.  Yeah.  Time to jump on another team.  Some of the great things about living in New York.  Plenty of choices.  Plenty of choices.  You guys have like 80 teams in even sports.  That's true.  Yankees.  Yankees, Mets.  Giants.  Jets.  Whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  One loses, you could jump on the bandwagon for the other. 
[00:05:30]  There you go.  I'm just adjusting everything.  Ah.  A little frustrating.  Is that a...  Everything seems okay.  For you, maybe.  In my phones.  No?  Well, there's all sorts of knobs to adjust the headphone volume.  Hey, you knob.  You got to do a little something over here.  A little tweak over here.  And then you got to...  Just a little tweak.  Then you got to tweak over here.  Is that all it needs?  I think this is about right now.  I was ready to go into this whole thing about baseball.  Bill Burr is a Boston Red Sox fan. 
[00:06:00]  That's right.  I'm a Mets fan, and Anthony's a Yankee fan.  Yeah.  And it's coming right down to the wire once again with the Yankees and the Red Sox.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm...  I guess I have to root for the Yankees a little bit now.  Do you?  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  I'm going to be a Mets fan.  I thought you guys hate the Yankees.  And actually root for the Yankees.  Yeah, but I want to still be in it.  What do you mean, in it?  How are you in it?  I don't want to like all of a sudden like,  Oh, well, my baseball season's over.  Then you have no interest.  If you're a Mets fan, your season is over.  I've got to have a little interest in something after my team's out, right? 
[00:06:30]  So why not just pick the Red Sox then?  I did last year.  I did last year.  I can't talk to guys like that.  I like who's ever winning.  That's who I like.  No, to be honest with you, Ant knows.  I'm a diehard fan to the end.  I don't really jump around.  I will jump around because my Jets are done.  I'm not going to sit down every Sunday and make believe the Jets actually have a shot  with Vinny Testaverde now throwing the fucking football.  Vinny, nice.  That was so awful, it was actually hilarious. 
[00:07:00]  Dude, he sucked three years ago when we got rid of him.  I don't think he's thrown a ball in, what, a year?  And he's going to be their quarterback now?  Yeah, I thought he sucked when he was 47.  He's about 47.  I don't care what he's telling people.  He's about 47.  How old are the gentlemen?  He has to be in his early 50s.  He's got to be, man.  I remember him.  Didn't one year he was on the White House lawn with Jimmy Carter after a successful season? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, Jimmy ran some kind of little hook pattern.  Yeah, his first pass was to Gale Sayers, I think.  Gale Sayers.  So, I will openly admit, I can't sit there and fake it.  My Jets are so done.  Is that a picture of him on the cover of Sports Illustrated?  The cover of Sports Illustrated.  What year is that?  1972.  Are you?  Stop.  Yeah, I don't know.  He came out in like, what, like, 87?  He came out in like, what, like, 87?  I don't know, man.  Get a close-up on that hand holding the football, and you'll see that there's a mood ring on his hand. 
[00:08:00]  A mood ring.  It's blue, so he's in a very good mood.  Oh, my God.  People getting shot at Kent State in the background.  Pet Rock, new craze?  Yeah, really.  Browns, draft test a Verde.  I actually thought, you know, as a Pats fan, I was worried about the Jets.  You know, they picked up Ty Law, and I always thought, I always thought Pennington was good. 
[00:08:30]  He just kept, always got hurt, you know?  Yeah, well, apparently again.  They brought Chad back way too early, and they're just starting to say that his career might,  might be done.  Could be a career-ending injury.  And then Jay Fielder's down, so now we've got Vinny Testaverde and some, ah, it's just,  it's just a ridiculous thing.  Can you get some guy, Brooke?  Yeah, exactly.  Some guy.  Exactly.  And I didn't really want to follow hockey because I'm a little bitter because they were on strike  for a while.  They don't call it a strike, but...  Aren't the fans supposed to just uprise and not pay attention to a season after a strike, 
[00:09:00]  a lockout or whatever they want to call it?  That old gag.  I know.  Never worked.  Major League Sports, they're so on to us.  Mm-hmm.  They don't, they know we're coming back.  You know, when they come back from strike, I'm out.  You know, it's going to hurt them in their pocketbooks.  Let's, yeah, let's make it hurt in their pocketbooks.  And there they are.  Could I have 10 years worth of season tickets?  Then all of a sudden, like, maybe the first game, there's a thousand less people, and then  the rest of the year, they sell out.  Somebody jumps out of the stands and throws the fake money. 
[00:09:30]  We're hacks at this point.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what it is?  They know we have nothing better to do.  Right.  You look in the stands, nobody's going to start reading.  Nobody's going to learn the second language.  We're losers.  And then the second a team starts really doing well, you think they're going to play to just  an empty arena?  Right.  Of course not.  You know how brilliant's coming back.  How fucking hilarious would that be if we actually stuck with that?  Had a set of balls and just didn't go.  Yeah.  The team's, like, huge rivalry and doing very well, and it's just empty. 
[00:10:00]  There's nobody there.  Players lose their big houses.  Yeah.  Every time there's a strike, though, there's one stupid fan they interview on TV.  I'm starting a boycott.  Yeah.  We're not going back.  We're going to show them that it's about the fans.  Right.  Yeah, like, your seat will just remain empty.  And he's outside the stadium with his little boycott as he's getting trampled by the people  entering the stadium.  Trying to get tickets.  Fucking zeros we are.  Just losers. 
[00:10:30]  We have no morals when it comes to this stuff.  There's no way that we can...  Yeah, there's no getting together people for something like that.  Do you understand they canceled the hockey season last year, and not only did they not  lower the prices, they raised them.  Yeah.  And people are there.  People will still show up, I think.  Now, of course.  The Rangers and Islanders played a preseason game at the NASA Coliseum.  They had, like, some ridiculous number of fans, like 15,000 fans or something for a pregame.  For a pregame.  That's huge.  Preseason game. 
[00:11:00]  Ranger-Islander games are huge rivalries.  I mean, you get both teams' fans there.  You think they're going to play the empty seats.  You honestly think because we're pissed off, man.  Of course not.  For the one person that might go, you know, I'm going to make a stand and not go, there's  20 people clamoring for that seat, willing to pay top dollar.  Absolutely.  They really price the psychos out of the stands, though.  Each year, they just keep getting moved up further and further towards the ceiling.  I remember when I used to go to sporting events, when I was a kid, I went to a Patriots-Jets 
[00:11:30]  game.  This was back, like, Freeman McNeil years, like Tony Eason, like, 83, I went to a game.  I was fucking terrified when I went there.  Everybody was hammered.  I think it was, like, two security guards, one on each side of the stadium.  Everybody was just completely hammered.  Fuck you.  You fucking suck.  I couldn't believe it.  And then I remember, like, literally seven years later, I had season tickets, and I'm  hammered.  I think it was 89 when the pets just stunk.  I'm fucking hammered, and I'm screaming, you fucking suck.  And I looked down, and there was some little kid looking up at me, terrified. 
[00:12:00]  It was like one of those, you know, the circle is complete, like, wow.  So I've become that guy.  You make a good point, though.  Going to games like that, I remember going to Shea to see the Jets play many years ago,  when the Jets used to play at Shea Stadium.  And my father, having to carry me, like, luggage out of the bathroom, went in there to  take a leak.  To keep you away from the kid touches?  It was just not even, it wasn't even about kid touches back then.  It was just about drunken buffoons pissing on every inch of the bathroom and trying to 
[00:12:30]  get me out of it.  It was so packed.  And then we sat down.  I got to watch Emerson Boozer play.  Or what the hell it was out there on the field.  The Jets were still called the Titans when he went, it was the old AFL.  I got to watch old Joe Willie Namath throw a few passes.  It was wonderful.  Eisenhower throws out the first pitch. 
[00:13:00]  It was great.  Well, good luck to your Red Sox there, Bill.  That's how this started.  I don't know what's going to happen.  I don't think either team, their pitching is, you know, shilling.  Let's say tied his tendon to his ankle.  I don't know.  I guess that's not a good thing to do in the long haul.  Just let it bleed.  Leave it alone.  That's it.  He seemed to have done fine the way it was.  Limping.  They fixed it.  Now what?  This just did off the sports wire.  The Jets have just signed Richard Todd.  So we're in good shape.  Richard Todd. 
[00:13:30]  Trying to get us back into the stands.  I'm very excited about that.  We ought to get Broadway Joe back.  What's he doing?  Besides just getting intoxicated.  I love you.  I love you, man.  You're just so beautiful.  Give me a kiss.  Give me a kiss.  Did you see that clip?  Yeah.  That's the best clip ever.  That was a while ago.  That was another thing.  Everybody flipped out.  It's just like 90% of the people, man.  You pull them out of the stands three quarters into a football game.  That's what they're going to sound like. 
[00:14:00]  You're drunk.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Trying to cheat on your wife.  Everybody's doing that.  So, Bill, you know when the Red Sox don't win the World Series this year that they're going  to start saying the curse is back.  Oh, ESPN will totally do that.  Chris Berman will do that.  We'll just be like, they'll just say like, oh, and is the curse back?  They've just turned it into a cartoon.  It's like, why don't you just admit we sucked for 85?  It's just a cop-out.  It's not us.  It's not the Red Draft and the wrong people.  It's these goblins.  Goblins. 
[00:14:30]  That's why I can't stay when I lived in Boston.  It was always like a fucking leprechaun.  There was always some sort of outside force rather than be like, why don't we all just  get our shit together and try to win?  It's because you guys didn't like the blacks back in the day.  Oh, that's another myth.  You didn't draft enough blacks because Boston is such a racist city.  As opposed to all the other open-minded teams like Marge Schott, that dude from the Dodgers.  Marge Schott openly hated the black man, but she still had him on the team. 
[00:15:00]  She realized that they were good players.  Right.  And Boston just wouldn't have it.  Is that it?  Is that what you...  Where do you hear this, Sophie?  I saw the whole...  Plus, you know what I love doing?  I saw the show on The Curse, and they talk about how, yeah, back in the day, the owner  was racist and didn't draft a lot of black players.  Yeah, they were just throwing out all kinds of theories.  Anything but we suck.  Yeah, exactly.  What I don't understand, say, you take a team like the White Sox.  I think they haven't won it since 1917.  There's no chant.  There's no curse. 
[00:15:30]  There's nobody...  They just somehow slide under the wire.  Every fucking...  They're blowing it again, and nobody's saying anything.  Where's the curse?  Yeah, nothing.  Plus, not only that, like, you look at the Yankees.  It's not like they were just beating us during that time.  They were fucking beating everybody.  Yeah.  And if you have one team that wins, like, 25% of them, you got, you know...  You're averaging.  Even if you got your shit together, you're going to win one every, like, 20, 30 years.  You know what I mean?  So...  So you better win it.  Exactly.  That's the thing. 
[00:16:00]  Because you lose a couple of them, and there is your curse, your...  Yeah, with 30 teams in the league, say, like, you know, you got, like, a 1 in 30 chance  of winning it.  You know, there's more, like, parity.  But, yeah, if you miss your chance twice, you're well into a curse.  It's 60 years.  You only have to fuck up twice.  Like, look at the Giants.  They had their shit over, and now it isn't.  Now, I give another five years.  A curse.  And then Chris Berman.  Ooh, the curse of the bay.  You know, if the Sox don't win this year, that they will say, you know, 
[00:16:30]  well, the Bambino just seemed to have taken a year off.  That's all that happened.  He was on life support, and the...  But the Bambino is black.  Who's taking credit for the fact that the Red Sox won the World Series, by the way?  There's got to be some nutcase up there in Boston saying, well, I finally, you know,  did this thing.  No, you know what it is?  I lit candles and burned incense and went to the paper's grave, and that's why they finally won. 
[00:17:00]  Anytime they do a story, whatever the angle is, there's always going to be a gene pool of,  like, 20 douchebags that you can put on film.  Nobody up there was fucking going, like, lighting candles.  You know what he's finding is one douchebag, and because he's a douchebag, he's going to go,  and, yeah, this is what I do, and he's, like, in his pajamas.  And he just makes everybody look bad.  Because everybody watches and goes, look at what fucking stupid Boston's doing.  They're lighting candles.  Oh, yeah, like, whenever they show us up there, like, anytime they show, like, I hated after we won it. 
[00:17:30]  And then they keep showing docks, like, we're all, like, lobster fishermen eating chowder.  And it's like, we're not.  We're just, we're not.  I never had a...  I fucking hate clam chowder.  It's disgusting.  Everyone dressed like the Gortons fishermen.  Oh, yeah.  With the rain slicker on, ready to go out to sea.  Oh, yeah, it looks like the beginning of a perfect storm.  They're just blue-collar people out there.  Hey, come on.  Honest day's work.  Bobby, get on the fucking boat. 
[00:18:00]  Dude, just, all I wanted, just give me one.  Because even, say, if the Yankees won the dishes, it's like, what are you going to do, chant 2004 at me?  Yeah, it gets rough now.  You've got to wait another, you know, 100 years or something.  But ESPN will figure out a way to somehow...  Oh, yeah, they'll take that angle.  Yeah.  The curse is back, whatever.  God damn.  Ben, that's good baseball talk, huh?  That's good baseball talk.  We haven't talked baseball in a while.  And Scott Farrell will be on at 9.  God bless him if he can talk baseball for two minutes.  You have a baseball Rolling Stones hat on? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, well, this is when they played at Fenway.  Oh, so it's the famous lips.  The famous lips from the Rolling Stones.  And the tongue actually has baseball stitching on it.  It's like a stretched-out baseball.  But he couldn't get that at the giant stadium show that Opa went with me to.  Oh!  Because that was a football stadium.  Right.  This was only sold at the baseball stadium.  I got this groovy pink XM hat.  XM.  Yeah, that thing is barely red, dude.  It's barely red, right?  It's barely red. 
[00:19:00]  That's why sports suck now.  That's what they gave out at the Rolling Stones show.  One day out in the sun, and that is the faggiest hat ever.  So is it still red?  It's barely teetering on red.  He looks like a marathon runner in 1978, like Bill Rogers.  Back when white guys could actually win that fucking thing.  Who was that other guy, Fix?  Jim Fix.  Jim Fix.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Dropping dead.  Yeah.  Dude, that Rolling Stones thing, that's why sports suck now.  Like, they've reached saturation point of people who give a fuck about sports, and now they're 
[00:19:30]  trying to have every other activity somehow jammed in there to basically get people who  don't give a fuck.  It's like, you know, Britney Spears and Kiss.  Going to kick off the NFL season.  You're absolutely right.  They already have the people that want to see the sports, but they're so greedy, they got  to try to get the peripheral people involved.  So, yeah, they have the rock concert before the show, before the event.  It's all about just marketing the shit out of it.  Yeah.  Like when they had, like, Dennis Miller doing Monday Night Football. 
[00:20:00]  I was just sitting there like, dude, you know, I never really needed this to be funny.  No.  No.  I was really just kind of enjoying the game.  I enjoyed it how it was.  You're right.  You could just sit and listen.  Look at that linebacker, baby.  Fucking cock at your breakfast.  Shut the fuck up.  This fucking was so irritating.  Yeah, they try to pull everything in, like some fucking 14-year-old girl is going to  watch Christina Aguilera and then be interested in the game.  Like, oh, Christina's over, but, you know, I've always wanted to watch football. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  You know, 14-year-old girl, I fit right in this demo.  All the time, they're trying to pull in a few more people.  Yeah, you'll just time it out.  She's on at halftime.  You don't like football?  You're not going to?  No.  You're not going to watch the game.  God, this game's so boring.  The titties are coming up.  So the Yanks lead the Sox by one, right?  One game.  How many games left?  Four.  Four games to go.  That's the biggest thing.  You want to, obviously, you want to be up going in.  Well, yeah.  Well, here it is. 
[00:21:00]  It's going to be a crazy weekend.  It's going to be a big weekend.  I just did one of those really obvious things.  It was an ELO, we call it.  The ELO.  You're going to want to be up going into this.  You want to score more runs than your opponent.  I think that increases your chances of victory.  We got the audio of Joe Namath.  Oh, this is my favorite clip ever.  He's like, I couldn't care less about the team struggling.  I want to kiss you.  This is one of our favorites.  One of the all-time great Jets quarterbacks, Joe Namath and Chad Pennington.  What impresses you about Jets? 
[00:21:30]  I believe everything that anyone else has watched Chad play impresses me.  The same thing impresses them.  He's a quality, classy quarterback that has a touch on the football.  He's not a thrower.  He's a passer.  His mind is ahead of what the defense is.  And if the Jets can support him, they will win the championship.  Joe, it's been a tough season for Jet fans. 
[00:22:00]  What does it mean to you now when the team is struggling?  I want to kiss you.  I couldn't care less about the team struggling.  What we know is we can improve.  Chad missed.  Chad Pennington, our quarterback, missed the first part of the season.  And we struggled.  We're looking for next season.  We're looking to make a noise now. 
[00:22:30]  And I want to kiss you.  Thanks, Joe.  Yeah.  Huge compliment.  Joe Namath, part of the four-decade team.  We'll be together at halftime.  That was great.  That was during the Patriots.  I remember that.  It was the Patriots-Jets game the day after Christmas a couple years ago.  Who hasn't been there?  I want to kiss you.  You're like woken up the next day and you're just thinking what you did.  You're like, oh, God, did I just fucking do that?  I got to go to work.  Hey, Susan.  Sorry about last night. 
[00:23:00]  I want to kiss you.  Who cares about the teams in the game?  He keeps getting more and more emaciated and that nose keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Hey, he was like a rock star, man, in the late 60s, early 70s.  Fucking rock star, that guy.  But proving time is a bitch.  Oh, it comes down to this.  I want to kiss you out of nowhere.  I think I did that when I was 15 or something. 
[00:23:30]  I was all drunk and I was in this disco that my mother used to work at.  It's a place called Chaz.  Remember that place?  I really don't.  You talk about it from time to time.  It's in the Walt Whitman Mall.  Oh, okay.  She was a waitress there and all the waitresses there that she worked with.  The Walt Whitman?  Yeah.  The Walt Whitman Mall.  Yeah.  One of our great writers, poets, whatever the hell he was.  Would you like to buy some swag?  I always laugh when dumb things are named after great Americans like that. 
[00:24:00]  Walt Whitman Mall.  He accounts a lot in his life and now he's just going to be remembered as a mall.  Oh, I know.  I was thinking of Slim Whitman.  Oh, that's a little different.  That high-pitched yodeling guy.  It's even worse that it's Walt Whitman, though.  Like this guy, you know, he's an American icon and slapped his name on a fucking Macy's.  Yeah, so she was a waitress there and the other waitresses she worked with were so hot. 
[00:24:30]  Just unbelievable hot waitresses.  Your mom was and still is very hot.  You know, I wasn't going to say my mom was hot.  I know, but I got to step up for you, bro.  She's a piece of ass, man.  I got to tell you, man.  I miss seeing her at the family parties.  It's wonderful that you say that.  It's getting uncomfortable.  It's getting uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And we would go to this place to get free drinks because we were like, we could drink at 15 over there. 
[00:25:00]  Me, my brother, any of our friends, you know.  Mom would just let us fucking drink.  Yeah, I mean, Anthony had the coolest parents.  The coolest parents.  They weren't married.  You know, they weren't together anymore.  I know, but both of them would just let you do shit.  Your dad was getting you hookers.  Your mom's letting you drink.  It was a hooker.  It was a friend of the family.  It's a hooker, dude.  It was a friend of the family.  She had a pay.  Who had self-esteem problems.  Right.  She was like 19.  Just a friend.  How old were you when you lost your virginity again?  13.  Yeah, see, I've got to tell Bill.  Bill, for my 13th birthday, I got a nice 10-speed bike. 
[00:25:30]  Anthony got a piece of ass.  I got a...  That's the difference between our fathers, okay?  I got a Ruger...  I love my 10-speed bike, but this guy got laid.  I got a Ruger Super Single 6 pistol and a girl.  And pussy.  I got a gun and a girl for my 13th birthday.  What did you get for your 13th birthday?  I think I was still getting Legos.  I think I got my first 10-speed bike, a really nice bike, at 13.  That's funny, yeah, because you're in your awkward stage there, like you're too old for 
[00:26:00]  toys.  Yeah.  And you would think you'd be too young for pussy, but evidently not.  No, it could go either way, you know?  Well, the way it was with me...  When did you last?  Oh, it was pretty quick.  Jesus Christ.  You know something, though?  Not as quick as you would think, because she had told me...  Actually, she was supposed to just be hanging out with me at the house, because my father  and his wife had gone out.  I guess with a wink to her, had gone out, left her over. 
[00:26:30]  We were watching, I think, Monty Python or something.  What was the excuse they gave that she happened to be in the house with you?  She used to hang out all the time.  Yeah, but wouldn't she go out with them to the local bar?  No, she was a little too young to be hanging out with them, because she was 19, but she  was a little too old, obviously, to be hanging out with me and my friends.  She was just hanging out.  And his father pimped out one of his friends to his own son.  So they went out.  That's amazing to me.  They went out.  We used to hang out, though, and watch TV.  Buzz, Gay Richard, used to come over and hang out. 
[00:27:00]  Stuff like that.  You know what's even funny about this shit is if you flipped, like if it was a 19-year-old  guy, hooking up a 13-year-old girl, it's completely fucked up.  Yeah, we talk about it all the time.  This is like really good story.  This is cool.  And, you know, it was like 1942, so the war was still going on, and we were all, you  know, wondering how that was going to end anyway.  Assholes.  So we just donated our toaster to the war effort.  We had no tinfoil.  It really stunk back then.  I bought her a pair of nylons. 
[00:27:30]  She was happy to see them.  It was one of those things.  Everyone left, you know.  She was there.  We were watching.  She asked me to go up, and, you know, she goes, oh, go take a shower.  And here's how it nepped I am.  I didn't think that this was going to happen.  It wasn't in my mind at all.  So I figured I'd toss one out in the shower, you know, because I was jacking like a monkey  back then.  So, you know, I did it in the shower.  So by the time I come out of the shower and hear from the bedroom, are you coming in? 
[00:28:00]  I'm like, and then all of a sudden, I got like butterflies, like, oh, wow, this is going  down.  Holy shit.  So I peek in the bedroom, and she was kind of sitting in the bed with the pillows propped  up behind her, and the sheets were down by her waist, and she had huge tits, and they're  just hanging out.  And it was the first live action tits I've ever seen.  I've seen a lot in magazines and everything.  This was the first live action tits, and I was looking like, holy shit.  And the fact that I had just jacked it, nothing, meant nothing. 
[00:28:30]  It was like, whammo, back again.  Wow, man, you just got thrown right into the fire, huh?  Oh, it was just, it was right into.  Never seen titties to just getting laid right there?  Never seen live titties.  It was just, and it was like, it was the mid-70s, you know?  So it was like, when the sheets came down, I just saw, you know, it was Albert Einstein  eating a London broil.  When he was in his 20s. 
[00:29:00]  It was just the biggest bush.  But I had gotten all of my reference from Playboys and Penthouse back then.  Yeah.  And the same thing.  They were all big, hairy bushes back then.  And it worked out well.  And then, you know, we wound up doing it a few times over the course of the next few years,  you know?  Oh, I thought you meant over the course of the next five minutes.  No, no, it was like a few, you know, years went by and she was still hanging out. 
[00:29:30]  So, a few years, you know.  I just love that, never saw live titties before.  I mean, that would have been victory enough.  I know, exactly.  To me, that was just like, that was, I won right there.  That getting thrown in the fire, that's like that third string quarterback for the Jets.  Right.  At the beginning of the game, he's like, he's holding a clipboard like he's trying, he's  fucking drawing pictures and shit.  Headset.  Yeah.  That's it, right?  Yeah, trying to look busy so no one notices that he's doing nothing.  Seven plays later, he's fucking in there.  And then the next day, I was, you know, in junior high. 
[00:30:00]  I was in my little junior high class.  That's what I was going to say.  Marco Forster Junior High.  How do you even, you've got to be jaded.  How do you even go to school the next day?  I was a changed man.  I walked with a new stride.  I looked around, looking at my classmates going, you don't even know what a pussy looks  like, motherfucker.  Don't even try to talk to me.  That is so weird.  They're all talking, what were they talking about?  Dumb stuff.  And you're like, I can't, I can't be with you anymore.  Yeah, about, you know, the conversation, maybe not the very next day, but over the course 
[00:30:30]  of time, you know, the conversations would come up of girls and sex and things like  that.  And I kind of kept it under my hat, though.  I really didn't, didn't talk about shit like that.  I would just listen to what they were saying.  And I didn't be like, dude, I've got, I got laid and stuff.  Right.  You know, it's just one of those things.  I want to kind of keep it on the low.  All right.  Back to your mom and her hot friends.  Oh, yeah.  So it was like 15 or so at the time, back in New York, and used to be able to go to  this disco, Chaz.  And it was such a bittersweet thing because we did not want to set foot in a fucking disco. 
[00:31:00]  It was like the worst place you could be seen by your friends.  All my friends, we were into hanging out in the woods, drinking Jack Daniels and listening  to Charlie Daniels and Molly Hatchet.  But you've got to think 15 at a disco is still cool because you're 15 in a place that serves  alcohol.  Yeah.  Well, that was, that was the, that was the sweet part of the bittersweet.  And the fact that the chicks were just dressed unbelievably hot for the time and doing coke 
[00:31:30]  and everything like that.  And we were able to drink, you know.  So.  Dude, he's 15.  Like, I wasn't even allowed to, I don't know, stay out after nine o'clock at 15.  So I'm doing some shots and shit, and this one waitress that worked there was really hot.  And I'm talking to her, and this is the whole thing, the just embarrassing part of this whole  thing was, I'm really thinking I'm doing well.  I'm 15.  She's like probably 27, 28, like that, really hot. 
[00:32:00]  And I'm 15, a hammered 15.  And she's talking to me just to be nice because I'm Rose Kid, you know, and, you know, she's  just being nice.  And at one point, I just went, I love you.  And I leaned over and knocked all her drinks over.  She had like a tray of drinks.  I went to like kiss her, and I go, I love you.  And I lean over, and she like backs off, and I knock all her fucking drinks over, and  everyone's laughing at me.  Oh, it was so embarrassing. 
[00:32:30]  He's doing this at 15 years old.  I was wrecked.  I know people got like, doing coke.  I just kept shaking.  Remember that movie, Over the Edge, with Matt Dillon, all those kids?  Eat it, you stinking pig.  Oh, man.  You shit.  You certainly lived a life, bro.  It was a very adventurous childhood.  I do remember the older woman thing, thinking that she actually liked you.  Yeah.  It was just no fun.  At my grandma's beach house, we went there every weekend. 
[00:33:00]  My uncle had a bunch of friends his age, so he's about 12 years older than me.  I was about maybe 11 or 12 at the time.  So these girls are wandering around in their mid-20s in bikinis and stuff, and one paid extra  attention to me, and I'm 12.  12?  So when you said, in my stupid 12-year-old head, I thought I had a shot.  You got a shot.  She's a fully developed woman.  I'm 12, barely starting puberty, digging holes and stuff at my grandma's beach house. 
[00:33:30]  And I remembered that that's so weird.  You got a shot.  All of a sudden, something happens with your wiring inside.  You're like, I think I might have a shot at this.  Yep.  And she was going off to go smoke pot with my uncle and drink beers, and I have basically  sippy cups.  But for some reason, somewhere inside, I'm thinking, oh my God, I have a massive crush  on this girl, and I think she likes me.  Because then she would pay attention to me and talk to me a little bit.  But obviously, now looking back, duh, she was just being nice. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Because she was hanging out with my family.  Yeah, that's what it is.  They're being nice.  To me, it was like, this is my dream girl, and I think we're going to get married.  She really likes me.  She really likes me.  What a dope.  Yeah.  You got to grow up.  Every guy.  Every guy still.  Joe Namath still thinks he has a shot.  See?  Did you hear him?  Yeah.  A few drinks in a mile.  I love you.  This is going to work, man.  Me, her.  He's got the whole thing planned out in his head.  Well, we got audio from the Vinnie Testaverity press conference. 
[00:34:30]  It's quick and painless.  I love you.  No?  Not on that one?  Vinnie?  This is my favorite football team, the New York Jets.  I'm going to do as well as I really can.  Oh, we are so fucked.  God, we were applauding three years ago when we got rid of him, and now he's back.  He's back.  You got to be kidding me.  Once again, after I left here last year, I always thought it would be a one-day contract  and retiring a New York Jet, but it's really good to be back. 
[00:35:00]  I'm excited.  I'm happy.  I'm nervous.  I'm anxious.  I'm anxious.  All those feelings of coming back and playing for the New York Jets again, sir.  These motherfuckers.  Okay.  Here comes the instant feedback.  It was bad to spill all her drinks, Anthony, especially since it was prohibition at the  time.  Anthony, are you guys sure you weren't 15 going to a speakeasy? 
[00:35:30]  Ant, you sure were the luckiest boy in the 48 states?  Oh, you're a vampire at this point, so.  No, her name wasn't Ruth Buzzy.  Her name was Christine, and her nickname was Buzz, for any trivia experts that want to  put together the O&A trivia game.  All right.  Let's go to another clip of Vinny Testaverde. 
[00:36:00]  I knew I would have a...  Well, let me put it this way.  I was hoping to have another chance to play, to be a backup for some young quarterback.  You know, Eli Manning, for instance.  That never happened in the offseason.  You know, I wanted to go to a team that was the right place for me, was the right situation,  and there really wasn't any until, you know, I got the call from Mike Annamom.  Until desperation set in. 
[00:36:30]  You sound very confident.  But I did get some calls in the offseason to go to other places.  They just weren't the right fit for me, I felt.  When those 18 quarterbacks went down.  Yeah.  All of a sudden.  All of a sudden.  Just saw Mike.  All of a sudden, I was the man again.  Jeez.  Oh.  Jeez, that's...  Well, you know, I left here last year to go with the Cowboys, and I was just thinking,  well, maybe, you know, because I wanted to leave last year when I did, maybe the organization, 
[00:37:00]  and especially Herm, because I've always had a great relationship with Herm, felt like  maybe I didn't want to be here.  So I thought, let me just give Herm a call and say, you know, Herm, I'm here if you need  me, in whatever capacity, you know, come in and work with Brooks and get him ready, or  is it kind of like a coaching mentor, or come in and play, in whatever capacity that may  be.  So, whether it's to actually be the starter, or it'll be a backup.  Wow.  We're all so excited.  This is great.  Oh, these bastards.  Hey, Ant, don't you mean you got a musket for your birthday? 
[00:37:30]  And, Ant, after you banged her, did you two head down to the movie theater and check out  the talkies for a nickel?  The last Vinny clip.  I'm playing a lot of Madden football with my son.  Now, seriously, I've been working out pretty good on a regular basis.  It's kind of my lifestyle anyway.  I wouldn't say that I'm in complete football shape, but I think I'm in better shape than 
[00:38:00]  probably a lot of people would have thought.  I've been throwing probably twice a week for the last month and a half.  Just kind of thinking that something might come around.  Great.  Twice a week.  I still need to get in football shape, which is my main focus and concern always.  But, again, sometimes when you're excited about something, you can overcome a lot.  I've been throwing twice a week.  Twice a week.  Holy shit. 
[00:38:30]  That's great.  I think I threw twice a week.  That's what I'm saying.  Most guys in their 30s are throwing twice a week, mostly on the weekends when they're  playing their stupid tech football with their friends.  I know.  He's in the backyard with his son throwing like a Nerf football.  Right.  Now, all of a sudden, he's ready.  Let's go to Rick.  What's up, Rick?  Opie, I've got to get on to you, man.  You just summed up the entire difference between you and Anthony.  Anthony at age 13 looking to get laid.  Opie at age 12 looking to get married. 
[00:39:00]  This is what leads to Java Locks.  Java Locks.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  All right.  Rob L. from Jersey called me Anthony Kelly Leak Cumia.  Kelly Leak.  Now, what sums it up, I'm starting to get the impression that Anthony was much, you were  very mature for 13.  Yeah, I was.  I went really quick from like 11, 12 to that kind of thing to 13, 14 where I was a lot more  mature than my peers. 
[00:39:30]  I was one of those guys that reached puberty like really, really late.  Really?  I was convinced I was going to be voted class shortest.  And now I'm about six foot tall.  Class shortest?  Yeah, and I would go home and like.  They had that?  Yeah, was that a category?  The cruel fucking thing to have.  Oh, yeah, they did before the PC police got a hold of everything.  Class dummy?  It was class shortest, class, you know, the tallest, the shortest, the, you know, the most  talented, this, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Ugliest?  Ugliest, yeah, sure.  Most distracting mole. 
[00:40:00]  What the fuck?  Just going to like fuck with the students?  Give them complexes for life?  We've got to break into this exciting conversation.  Oh, yeah, here we go.  Because one of our friends is on the line.  It's Steve-O!  Yeah!  Steve-O!  I don't play!  I don't play!  I don't play!  Oh, my God!  Steve, did you see the clip?  I do not, like, I woke up just in time to catch on TV with no recollection of, and I 
[00:40:30]  mean, dude, I'll tell you what happened, dude.  We worked it out with the producers, they're like, they're like, all right, what stunt  are you going to do?  And I was like, well, I want to do this tablecloth stunt.  They're like, well, we want something more classic, Steve-O.  And I was, like, offended, you know?  Yeah.  So I was like, all right, well, I'll tell you what.  I'm going to get crap-faced.  You know, I see how good...  Oh, you're on satellite radio?  Yeah, you can say shit-faced.  Shit-faced. 
[00:41:00]  Fucking shit-faced.  All day long.  And then I said, well, caught my buddies from the sheriff's department.  We're having them breathalyze me on the show.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, the sheriff's got cold feet.  I showed up, they got fucking standard-issue, like, retail breathalyzer.  The fucking...  I blew a .24 two hours before the taping and became furious that that was...  I was like, come on.  I got cheese.  And I don't want to let them down.  I don't remember anything.  I do not...  Like, I had a... 
[00:41:30]  I got high maintenance hot babe in my bed.  Yeah.  You know, like, ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  And, uh, she tells me that two men carried me into my pad.  And, uh, as I yelled that I was going to kill both of them.  Yeah, you were kind of violent.  I know, dude, but how many talk shows am I going to talk about Billy Bob tattoo on?  Right.  And you're going to insult me with a what's an off-road tattoo?  You know, we're working on getting people to figure out what this show is, not, like, 
[00:42:00]  my tattoo I had for three years.  So, you actually, you were so hammered, but even through your being hammered, he was getting  angry at some things that just make him angry.  Yeah, I was...  I honestly cannot remember, like, from, like, two hours before the vaping, I came.  Steve, I got to ask you again, though.  Have you seen the clip of you on this show?  Of course, man.  Okay.  I saw it, and I loved it, and, uh, you know, I was still waiting for me.  I hit my... 
[00:42:30]  I got carried into my house at 6 a.m.  Or, no, I'm sorry, 6 p.m.  6 p.m.  I got carried in.  I fucking passed out.  And then 11 p.m.  I wake up.  I wake up at 11 p.m.  My life sucks so bad.  I take three, a leave, two Tylenol p.m., and a bar and a half of Xanax.  I watch the show, and I was like, it was like a piece of good news to me, like, this  show, you know?  What did you do to your leg? 
[00:43:00]  It looks pretty rad, like, I get a scar.  Yeah, you put your foot right through the top of his table.  Well, yeah, well, I mean, like, you know what?  Jimmy Kimmel would have handled that.  Jimmy Kimmel would have turned that into gold.  All I needed to do was hand me a breathalyzer, and it was a victory.  Even though, you know what, the producers emailed me.  They got the highest ratings they've had so far.  I'm sure.  Of course they did.  And, my God, I don't want everybody, well, I've got to spill some beans for you guys. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I just sold a 10-episode series of my very own television show.  A&E?  Well, yeah, Intervention, huh?  No, I'm just kidding.  But it's the same producers that did every season of Real World, every season of Road  Rules, every season of Parasels and Symbols.  Right.  Richard Branson.  That's a good production company.  God damn it. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, yeah, B&R Murray, yeah.  Now it's Camp Stevo.  Camp Stevo, and what's going to be the premise?  I'm running a rehabilitation center for uptight parents in a summer camp setting.  Summer camp setting.  Damn it.  Now that's the TV idea.  That's the side of a bus.  That's the side of a bus.  I'm going to, no, no, no, dude.  You walk away from me, you're walking away from your own kids, pal.  I'm going to force people into a better relationship with their kids.  Are they going to have to maybe deal with you and realize how easy they have it with 
[00:44:30]  their own children?  It's less that than it's just like, look, you know, if you cross the line in the sand,  then I'm going to say, all right, you know, we need to have a conference.  They're going to walk in, and at the push of a button, they're going to be looking at  a huge screen with their little kid's face lighting up when they find out they're on the  phone with Stevo.  So I'm going to tell them their parents suck, they're a loser, and I hope that they watch  it with their parents, and they're gone, you know?  That's kind of a gnarly line in the sand, and then there's cash bonuses for college funds. 
[00:45:00]  It's pretty gnarly, dude.  It's pretty gnarly.  Well, congrats, man.  That's pretty cool.  I was kind of bummed, you know, until I saw Page Six, where I was like, hell yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Dude, were you trying to choke at him?  I wasn't trying to choke him.  I was just, I don't, to be honest, my God, you would know better than me.  I can't remember.  Because it just sounded like he was gasping for air. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, we're going to play the audio in a minute here.  When you watch footage of yourself that you don't remember, it's weird, let alone watching  it on national television.  Yeah, I can only imagine.  I'm not sorry.  He's not sorry, kid.  I love it.  Good.  Not at all.  No.  Wow.  Yeah, you are hard fucking core, man.  Hey, dude, your producer guy called me up.  Love that guy, even though he's gay.  He says you guys have five million people listening right now. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, we just hit the five million mark.  Is that through the course of the morning, or is that at this time right now?  Right now, we've got about maybe 78 listeners.  78, I like that about you guys.  And then it grows from here.  So, you know.  Yeah.  Well, if it means anything to you, I've been really pounding a lot of meat saga.  You know, I've just been parking in the pink zone. 
[00:46:30]  Wait, what happened to your really hot model girlfriend that we talked about last time you  were here?  Um, like, uh, our careers, our careers became the priorities.  Is that in, though?  Like, uh, no one's taking credit or blame.  There you go.  Yeah.  Uh, but, but you're, but you're, uh, you're getting some now.  And who was the hot chick you had, uh, in bed when they...  Oh, man, you've got to say hi to my baby.  My baby, come on, it's five million people listening.  Ooh.  Hello, how are you? 
[00:47:00]  Hi, Steve-O's baby.  What's your name?  My name's Megan.  Hi, Megan.  Megan.  And you were in bed waiting for Steve-O when he, uh, was tossed into the hotel room?  Yeah, actually, I was in the bed and I can hear him yelling from the bottom hall and I  was in his bedroom and it's pretty far distant, so...  Were you, were you scared for your life when he came in?  Because he was pretty hammered.  I was, actually, I was more scared for him, I think, at the time.  Did he, did he puke?  He was bleeding everywhere.  Did he vomit?  No, he didn't vomit, actually.  That's a hardcore motherfucker, man. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  How did you guys meet?  How did we meet?  Yeah.  You must know how we met.  Oh, my God, dude.  Oh, my God.  We met in the seedy underworld of West L.A.  And the house we met at was just, actually had the door kicked in by the ATF today.  And I was like, I was a hair away from being there.  Like, I can't even believe that he didn't even barge in there for drugs.  It was counterfeit money that it was all about.  I didn't say anything more. 
[00:48:00]  Steve-O was just involved in all kinds of shit, man.  I love it.  You know that I'm, like, a gnarly, like, it's just pretty gnarly, dude.  Like, I've been hanging out with a lot of people who have guns.  And, you know, at the end of the day, I would rather, I would rather, like, just be shot like John Lennon than suck like, take your pick.  You know?  I actually wrote an article of why I want to be shot dead by a rapper.  And I was terrified, terrified to send it anywhere. 
[00:48:30]  Give me an email address.  You can read it out on the radio right now.  Oh, really?  It's the gnarliest.  Send it to Ben.  Honestly, it's so gnarly.  Steve?  And I want you guys to have it because I like you guys.  I definitely want to read it, man.  Send it to...  Hold on.  I'm going to put you on hold because all the listeners will start emailing us and mess us up.  I'll stay on the horn, man.  I love you guys that much.  Just put me on hold and go back to your boring crap.  I love that time when you called the guy's mom and said he was in jail. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, right on, bro.  Hi, mom.  I'm in jail.  Hey, do that real quick while I fire this over.  I want to be on the radio when you read it.  All right.  I'm that gnarly.  Holy shit.  Hey, Steve, did you have sex when you came back with that hot chick when you were all drunk?  Hey, baby, did we have sex when I came back?  Doubters, right?  Do you guys want to have sex now, live on the show?  No, dude.  I'd much prefer to go to a church.  Yeah, that doesn't work.  That don't work out too well for us. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  This is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to throw you on hold.  Hey, baby, put me on with the other guy.  I'll stand on the line, dude.  You've got to get my article, dude.  Go back to your own regular shit.  All right.  I'm going to play hi, mom.  I'm in jail for you.  I'm going to throw you on hold.  Yeah, hi, mom.  I'm in jail and fucking put me on with your little gay dude.  Ben.  Ben loves it, though, man.  Dude, you're not going to believe it, dude.  I'm literally trying to get murdered.  All right.  We'll read the Steve-O article on the air about how he wants to be murdered by a rap star. 
[00:50:00]  Not, dude.  Or Christians.  He wants to be shot.  All right.  Hold on.  We're going to give you an email address.  It's Steve-O.  We'll come back to you in a minute here.  There he goes.  There's Steve-O on hold.  Wow.  Well, there it is.  He was hammered.  Part of the show.  That's something I didn't read.  That it was part of the show was for him to get hammered and take a breathalyzer.  Right.  And then he got out.  Oh, that's right, yeah, because they try to make it seem like he just showed up that way.  Like he just showed up drunk like that, but that was part of it.  And this guy who humps yaks is just completely unprofessional. 
[00:50:30]  So, we should play the audio of Steve-O on Adam Carolla.  Yeah.  Got to play that.  Adam Carolla, man.  He's a really talented dude, I got to tell you.  Exactly.  What?  What?  Yeah, welcome back to Too Late on that.  I don't like that, bitch.  Yeah.  Tonight, our studio guest is Malcolm McClure, the great author. 
[00:51:00]  No, Steve-O.  Eh, eh, eh.  Steve-O in studio tonight.  I don't like that, bitch.  Yeah, that was Steve-O.  Yeah, it was Aspen.  All right, Steve has had a couple of glasses of Chardonnay.  And I will tell you, bitch.  All right?  Hey, see, see, focus, baby.  Hey, hey, see, here's the thing.  All right.  We thought it'd be fun if you had a few drinks.  And then came out here and did a stunt.  I would love that.  All right, we're going to do that. 
[00:51:30]  We're going to reel it in just a little bit.  I would love that.  We're going to get our focus.  We're going to get our focus now.  Going to focus on a couple of questions, take a few phone calls.  Then you'll do the stunt.  If I did not love Adam Carolla, then I would not love my business being here.  Right.  All right.  And I'm just saying, I'm saying tonight, Steve, it's important that you love Adam Carolla.  Just don't love him.  Oh, my God.  I love him so hard.  Don't love on him. 
[00:52:00]  I love him so hard.  I love Adam Carolla so hard.  Yeah.  Over here, buddy.  Then I will literally love Adam Carolla into the ground.  Yeah.  Let me, what about, I want to see a couple of your tattoos for, we take some phone calls.  Hey, ask me for a tattoo, brother, man.  I know you got one of Angelina Jolie or Billy Bob Thornton or something like that.  You got the Billy, that's your Billy Bob one.  What is that?  Yeah.  What is this one down here that looks like it's a fanball? 
[00:52:30]  Dude, I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness.  I thought you loved me.  I will kill you.  Oh, a second ago, you loved me.  I loved you.  All right.  No humping.  No humping.  Easy.  Easy, buddy.  We got to finish the segment.  All right.  Come on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Hold on.  Steve.  I'm all right.  Let's call the phone. 
[00:53:00]  Honey.  You ready to take some phone calls?  Come on.  No, I know.  Let's take some phone calls.  Oh, okay.  My mic flew off, so I got to use this thing.  All right.  This is great.  I feel like Geraldo.  Oh, oh, oh, no, Steve, Steve.  Steve, Steve, don't break me, Steve. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Steve, that was a rental.  How do I do that?  That was a rental, Steve.  How do I do that?  That was a rental.  All right, Steve.  Yeah, bitch.  Steve, hold on a second.  Here, I'll tell you what I think we should do.  Yeah.  I was going to take some phone calls, Steve, but you're not playing.  I don't play.  You're not playing along.  I don't play.  Steve, if you can mind your P's and Q's.  I don't play.  We can take a couple phone calls and do a TV show.  Yeah, I don't play.  Otherwise, you're just going to take a break and call security. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I don't play.  All right.  All right.  I don't play.  All right.  So we'll get security.  Yeah.  We'll run the rest of the Jimmy Kimmel show.  I don't play.  And we'll be right back after this.  Oh, watch out, Steve.  Steve, watch out.  And there you have it.  If you want to see the video, it's up on opandanthony.com.  Steve-O losing it on the Adam Carolla show.  I don't play. 
[00:54:30]  It's practically as rad just audio as it is to watch it.  Dude, you were so fucking hammered.  When you get a...  I love when someone's drunk and they get on that one thing like that.  I don't play.  And it just keeps going and going and going.  Steve-O, you're a true rock star, my friend.  Can you imagine how much worse it could have been?  Um, I just wish you tipped him over.  Yeah.  You're about to find out.  You're about to find out. 
[00:55:00]  Dude, I emailed that suicide note.  It's called Suicide by Journalism.  All right.  We're waiting for them to print it up and...  We're waiting for them to print it up and bring it in here.  Yeah, I'll read it to you, you bastards.  All right.  Got it.  Come on.  Like, I'm pretty drunk right now, to be honest, you know?  Yeah, you're going to crash it.  And they said you're going to crash it.  Yeah, I know.  The Bars Annex is definitely competing with the illegal street narcotics.  But not so much that I can't deliver. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, dude, what's up with Wild Boys, by the way?  Oh, man.  I'd love to brag, dude.  I'd love to brag.  But I got...  That's a question mark for right now.  Why is that?  The show's hysterical.  I know.  It's just a...  Fuck MTV2, man, if you know what I'm saying.  We decided we're on a bigger present.  Yeah.  And I can't elaborate.  Okay, here it is.  It's called Suicide.  All right.  Here we go. 
[00:56:00]  Steve-O.  Okay, in an email to Johnny Knox, I said,  Knox, I wrote some stuff about you in this amazing article.  Any tips on how I can sell it to Rolling Stone?  Suicide by journalism.  Why I want to be shot dead by a rapper.  Hey, Ryan, do you have to talk to five million people?  Here it is, dude.  I often say...  I often say I don't want to live long.  I want to live fucking forever.  And it's not some kind of joke.  The fact is, our only real instinct is to survive, 
[00:56:30]  and we, all of us, are going to wind up dead as fuck.  I like to think that once we're all dead,  future generations will giggle at video footage  of the sillier things I did in life.  In July of 2004, I walked into the G-Unit studio,  had $750,000 worth of jewels draped all over me,  and proceeded to say many things on a mixtape  to deliberately jeopardize my life 
[00:57:00]  when 175,000 copies of it were distributed  in the first shipment.  I started beef with people I knew nothing about,  except that they were genuinely violent criminals.  Why would I do such a thing?  Believe it or not, it's because I'm scared of two things.  Anticipation of death coupled with prolonged agony and suffering,  and the depressing likelihood of sucking in my life  once I pass my prime. 
[00:57:30]  I'm already 31 years old.  The wrinkles are kicking in,  and I want to do my best work,  then get shot without seeing it coming,  and be dead before I hit the ground.  That way, I will have my legacy forever intact.  Unlike Christian Slater,  who begged me for cab money the last time I spoke to him.  Did I just write that despite the fact  that I know Christian Slater has been known  to carry loaded firearms to airports? 
[00:58:00]  That's fucking right I did.  Come on, Christian.  Bring it.  I'm ready to die.  Now that I'm warming up,  let me explain why I'd rather be  old dirty bastard than Flava Flake.  ODB, bless his heart,  was never a hypocrite.  He was far more violent in his personal life  than he ever was in his art,  and he died doing what he loved,  drugs. 
[00:58:30]  ODB was merrily wrapping away in his studio  after having swallowed a twisted-up sandwich baggie  of powder cocaine,  which had begun to leak,  when he instantly died of a heart attack.  He did not suffer,  and he will live forever  as the king of being what he said he was,  a filthy motherfucker.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What the hell?  Oh, no.  What happened? 
[00:59:00]  God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Right in the middle of his very cool story.  What happened to the phone?  I have no idea.  He's kind of crapped out.  They'll get him back.  Holy crap.  This is like gold.  This is radio gold.  This is his fucking suicide note right here.  This is his suicide note.  Holy crap.  He knows the number, right, Ben?  Are they calling him back? 
[00:59:30]  All right, we'll get him back on.  Maybe this is part of his stunt.  You think?  Just offed himself.  I see.  He does seem like the kind of guy  that kind of wants to die, you know?  We got him?  It seems like he has it planned out.  Yeah.  Where was I, dude?  Where was I?  Steve, I was sorry about that.  You were at...  Filthy motherfucker.  Filthy motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bless his heart.  He died.  All right.  He did not suffer,  and he will live forever  as the king of being what he said he was,  a filthy motherfucker.  I don't see Flava Flav as much of a threat, 
[01:00:00]  so I won't waste many words on him.  I'll just say,  911 used to be a joke.  Now look at Flava Flav.  I think we all know that Sean Diddy Combs  isn't at all scary,  but I've got beef with him.  He disrespected me in a bar  after I put major effort into performing a stunt  for him and his friends.  With that in mind,  I would like to know how the world forgave him 
[01:00:30]  for calling a witness to testify against his friend,  the rapper Shine,  to put him away for 10 years  just to avoid having any form of pesky probation.  Puff,  that was a bitch-ass move.  So if you've still got any actually scary people around you,  send them my way.  While I'm on the topic of scary people  in the hip-hop community,  let me add that my affiliations with the G-Unit are real. 
[01:01:00]  Anybody who's got any problems with the G-Unit  need to take that up with me.  Now people often ask me  if I have beef with Johnny Knoxville.  And the answer is,  and most likely always will be no.  Johnny could have been part of the plan  to make sure that none of his jackass sidekicks  got paid shit for our jackass movie.  But he refused to set foot in front of a camera  before his boys were taken care of. 
[01:01:30]  Johnny also recently purchased  a his and hers set of firearms  for him and his wife.  He told me that he bought her a, quote,  nice and light Smith & Wesson hammerless .38  to shoot him.  And I'm telling him to use his, quote,  sweet Winchester 12-gauge on me  for sharing that information.  I'm really getting hot now.  So let me move on to Christianity.  I would never burn down a church  because that would be to ruin a building 
[01:02:00]  that could potentially be used  for productive activity one day.  I will say that the Holy Shroud of Turin  displays an image of Leonardo da Vinci,  not Jesus.  And for Christians to feel that Jesus died  for us to put our sins on his path  is revolting to me.  When I do wrong,  I like to hold myself accountable,  not Jesus.  And if any of you Christian assholes  don't like that, 
[01:02:30]  then please fucking shoot me.  While I've been writing this,  I've felt as though a great weight  has been lifted from my shoulders.  I feel great.  I'm going to go out  and do something really silly.  For all the people  who don't like the silly things I do,  remember,  you'll be just as dead as me  when your great-grandchildren  are loving that fucking shit.  Steve and P.S.  Yeah.  Who's going to feel really tough 
[01:03:00]  for picking on an idiot like me?  Wow, man.  It's like Dave Chappelle said, man.  I'm an idiot.  I've got diplomatic immunity.  But I would rather fucking go down  with a bullet to the dome  that I didn't see coming  than suffering a terminal ward  for like a long time, right?  Right.  If anybody doesn't like me,  you know what?  Fucking shoot me. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  That's the most sense  you've ever made, Steve-O.  It's so rad, dude.  I mean,  I'm already going to get a vasectomy  just for laughs.  You know?  Yeah.  I was thinking about  getting a vasectomy  just for the purposes  of reversing it.  Yeah.  But then I realized  that would be a crime  against humanity.  Fuck that, dude.  I wouldn't take care  of a hamster.  Hell.  You know,  if you want,  dude,  you should add  the gaudies  to that list. 
[01:04:00]  Nah, dude.  Like,  what am I,  what are they going to,  what are they going to do?  Like,  attack me with hair gel?  You know?  Like,  is your mom going to give me  a bad write-up?  I mean,  Jesus Christ.  You know,  I just read my own words.  I'm a wordsmith.  I love it.  We're going to post that  on our website for you,  Steve-O.  That is very cool, man.  Well,  yeah,  I emailed it to you,  and I honestly didn't  get on the horn 
[01:04:30]  with you guys  for my health.  And I don't take  satellite radio  seriously.  I really don't.  You know,  the odds that  any of the murderers,  you know,  I mean,  whatever,  dude,  they aren't listening,  you guys.  You got nerds  listening to you,  pal.  We're on in the escalades,  my man.  That's right.  We're on in all the escalades.  But,  dude,  the chances of you guys  beating my  page six coverage  for my Adam Carolla  debacle,  Yeah.  I'd say you're up 
[01:05:00]  against the wall  trying to kill me today.  Yeah.  We'll try,  though,  Steve.  We did pretty well  with our press coverage  over the years.  Do try,  man.  Do try,  because I do not want  to discount my legacy,  man.  I'm not going to pull  a fat Elvis on you.  No.  We don't want to see that.  No.  All right.  Really not?  Genuinely,  genuinely not,  dude.  I'm not,  I mean,  whatever.  I'll be dancing  to Michael Jackson's crap.  But,  you know, 
[01:05:30]  when people are enjoying  my heart,  I'd like them to not  have a conscience about it.  Did this happen  when you hit your 30s,  Steve?  You started really  thinking about this?  I don't know,  dude.  The bar's just been  getting ridiculously high,  dude.  I am like,  I'm going to level  with you.  I am on a downward  spiral that I am  going to televise.  I'm the only one  not,  I'm the only one  that's not apologizing.  Yeah.  Yeah,  dude,  I'll show you  the price of fame,  pal. 
[01:06:00]  Holy shit.  It's laying between  my bed sheets.  Yeah,  dude,  you look at,  I don't even call it  a bed,  dude.  It's the blue light  special.  Wow.  Are you going to  try to crash now  or what?  I'm going to try  and crash through  a fucking serious  vulva.  He's going to  have some sex  and then maybe  go to sex.  All right,  will you tell him  that you demand  I have sex?  I demand sex  from him right now. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Good luck with that.  Well,  you guys should have  sex on the show,  I'm thinking.  You've done it all.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yes.  You have to ask him,  I'd say yes.  Would you have,  hey,  would you have sex  on our show  right now?  Yeah,  whatever.  She's not on the rag  that bad.  Wow.  She had to really  talk me into the last one,  you know,  so we had to put  her towel down.  That's where your line is?  Dude,  that's where your  fucking line is?  Dude,  I'd be nailing this chick  like literally  every hour  on the hour. 
[01:07:00]  It's just that  pulling the rip cord  is kind of sketchy  with me.  The motherfucker,  after everything  you've done,  you're a little touchy  on a girl  on her period?  Well,  I mean,  I like that.  I don't know  how to fuck her.  I only know  how to make love,  you know?  This could be  your greatest stunt.  Go down on her.  Yeah,  there you go.  Hey,  Steve,  you want to fire up  the lights  and do the old  red wing thing?  This girl's retired,  man.  She doesn't even, 
[01:07:30]  she takes like  four hours  to prepare  and seven foot  outside the house.  Yeah.  Hey,  dude,  how much time  did you guys  expect to fucking  sit on me  and how much  do I love you  for giving me  all this airtime?  Let me mention  I have my own  line of shoes.  Steve-O,  we're just stalling  hoping that you're  going to have sex  live on our show  today.  You're gold.  If you think  I've been out of line  on your radio show,  how about hopping  onto my website,  steveovideo.com.  steveovideo.com. 
[01:08:00]  As a communal,  like,  in a membership  community,  I have more people  worrying about me  on the internet  than ever before.  They worry about them.  And the internet  will be dying  every week.  Yeah,  well,  I'm sure it's coming  one of these weeks.  I know,  I'm really going to try  and get a will  before I actually die.  Yeah,  you should.  But dude,  I'm going to go  down hard,  dude.  And we'll all  be watching,  steve.  And who knows,  dude,  you know,  for all my goofiness,  dude,  no one's going to pick 
[01:08:30]  on me,  man.  I'm going to be  fucking 90 years old.  And I don't know,  dude,  let's just do this  for another couple  decades.  All right.  Steve-O.  Hey,  dude,  your listeners  aren't bummed on me,  are they?  Not at all,  man.  They love you.  And if they are,  I would like them  to shoot me.  Hey,  man,  it's been a pleasure  to get back to your show.  Please,  more mom.  Mom,  your son's in jail.  I love that shit.  All right,  we'll play that  going into commercial.  Take it easy,  Steve.  Check in from time to time. 
[01:09:00]  I'll never get any smarter.  All right,  thank you,  Steve-O.  And thank you,  not even you assholes.  Fuck you guys.  Thank you to your listeners,  you idiots.  There we go,  Steve-O.  Janiela,  man,  a lot of love,  dude.  Thank you for everything.  All right,  peace,  Steve.  He is a true rock star.  Oh,  my God.  That is a rock star  right there.  You can't dispute that  on any level.  That is a rock star  right there.  He's always fucked up,  and it's just,  he's one step away  from just being dead.  It'll be in the papers, 
[01:09:30]  like,  oh,  Steve-O found dead  somehow.  I don't know how.  I'm thinking drugs,  but who knows now?  Maybe one of these  motherfuckers will shoot him.  Those phony tough guys  you see on,  like,  you know,  in music and that shit,  you know,  I'm not afraid to die.  This dude,  seriously.  He seriously would rather  go out like that  in the blaze of glory.  He pull a gun on him,  he's like,  come on,  motherfucker.  You're not even gonna  get a pussy.  Pull the trigger,  fucker.  All right,  we're gonna take a break.  As we go to break, 
[01:10:00]  one of Steve-O's favorite,  favorite things that we do  from our Demental World CD,  Hi, Mom,  I'm in Jail.  Jason,  are you ready to play  Hi, Mom,  I'm in Jail?  Yeah.  You got a good story?  Yeah.  What are you gonna tell her?  I'm gonna tell her I had  marijuana and I got caught  by the cops.  Will that piss her off?  Yep.  All right,  let's give her a shot.  Drugs.  Hello?  Mom?  What?  I screwed up.  What?  I'm in Jail.  Why?  I have possession  of marijuana.  You're kidding.  I don't know  who to call. 
[01:10:30]  Should I call  Uncle Mark?  It's my one phone call.  Should I call  Uncle Mark  or something?  I'll ask you  if this is your one phone call,  I'll have to call him.  What do you need?  I don't know.  Call is being monitored,  ma'am,  by the police department.  Okay.  What does he need  to do?  The judge came in  and set bail  at $10,000.  It's a very serious offense.  $10,000?  Well,  if it was a joint or two,  it would be one thing.  He was caught  with 12 kilos  in his trunk.  They're obviously 
[01:11:00]  trying to deal.  So he's being arraigned  as a dealer  and not as a user.  Okay.  Okay.  When is all this  and when did...  Where are you...  Where is he  and where can I come see him?  I'm in Cambridge now  at the Cambridge jail.  We're going to bring him  to one of the city jails.  Okay.  How can I get directions  to get there?  Can I get there,  talk to him? 
[01:11:30]  Tell me what I need to do.  I'm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  What,  Ma,  what should I do?  Like a lawyer?  Yeah,  you need a lawyer?  Well,  he's been crying  like a girl, too.  Well,  I've got to get  to the bottom of this.  He's a very good person.  I've heard that before.  It's more of that  bad parenting.  I've seen this before  with these kids.  They run the street.  They're running around  the streets like wild.  And now they're  selling drugs.  Did you know  your son was doing this?  No,  no. 
[01:12:00]  Not to mention  with the,  uh,  being found,  uh,  with the prostitute  in the car,  in the combat zone?  That's,  that's,  what is that all about?  Don't,  don't even deny it,  son.  Okay,  please,  don't even,  he's already given  a full confession  before he even  talked to a lawyer,  which just shows  how smart he is.  Okay,  officer.  Son,  sonny.  I,  I,  I didn't know  what to do.  Okay,  officer.  Yes,  ma'am.  Please,  please help me,  okay? 
[01:12:30]  I,  I'm in  Pittfield,  Massachusetts.  I'm three hours away.  Please give me  directions of how  to get there  and where you are  and I will be there.  Well,  by that time  he's going to be  transported out of here.  I'm not sure  where they're taking him  but I'm sure  which jail we do  take him to,  they're going to like him  real,  real good there  tonight,  if you know what I mean.  He's pretty good looking.  Yeah,  he,  he better not drop  that soap,  if you know what I mean.  Please,  sir.  I think Bubba,  Bubba's going to like him  in the shower room,  if you know what I mean, 
[01:13:00]  ma'am.  Listen,  officer.  Yes,  ma'am.  We,  you're a good family,  blah,  blah,  blah.  I've heard it before,  miss.  I've heard it before.  Okay,  you've heard it before.  All right,  all right.  He's had enough.  He's had enough.  He's had enough.  Mom,  you're on the radio.  Oh,  my goodness.  Mom?  He couldn't take it anymore.  Mom?  What?  Hey,  you're on the radio.  Huh?  It's a joke.  Oh,  Jason. 
[01:13:30]  Happy Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day,  Mom.  Who is this?  This is Opie and Anthony.  if we do a radio show in Boston.  Well,  he is a good kid,  but he's written out of the will.  Do you realize who you hired?  He is a disruptive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What horrible game.  Our new bosses said,  you guys should get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways  to celebrate mediocrity.  Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:14:00]  It's psychotic.  So be it.  Threat no more.  There's a killer piece in  to prepare for  So be it.  Settle the score.  Touch me again for the buzz  that you will hear evermore.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Bill Burr sitting in today once again.  He's been doing a great job for us.  Absolutely.  Jim Norton in Hollywood  filming his HBO series. 
[01:14:30]  He'll be back  for a quick visit.  I think maybe a week from...  Wow, I don't even know.  When does Jim's show come out?  Don't even know.  We're going to have to get all those updates  from Jimmy soon.  Jimmy's going to be back  maybe in like two weeks actually.  For a couple days  and then he's gone for another three weeks.  So,  Bill,  you're stuck with us, man.  Wow.  And Bill's going to be in Sacramento  starting a week from today,  I believe, right?  Yeah,  the punchline out there  Wednesday through Sunday  and next week.  And we had a pretty big audience 
[01:15:00]  in Sacramento  when we were on regular radio, so...  Yeah,  I got a lot of stuff on MySpace.  People sending comments  and that type of shit.  Nice.  Nice.  Real nice.  Very, very good.  Look at these professional news people  and radio people.  They just showed some  like old  radio news people  like Edward R. Murrow  and we're sitting here  doing this show.  Quite the contrast.  It's got to keep evolving, man.  Well, it certainly has.  Man.  Man. 
[01:15:30]  Got to keep evolving.  I just became  an even bigger Steve-O fan.  Yeah.  I agree with a lot of the shit  that he was...  A lot of his writings?  Yeah.  The writings of Steve-O?  Yeah.  Didn't fuck up one word.  He really did a very good job  of reading that, didn't he?  Considering that he's on drugs  all the time.  It wasn't monotone?  I thought he had his...  No.  He threw the inflections  where needed.  But you sober him up  and then give him  the same thing?  Forget it.  Or get him drunk  to the point he was  on Adam Carolla.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't play. 
[01:16:00]  I don't play.  I don't play.  I don't play.  He's like old school, that guy.  He's like the real deal.  You know, you go to  these rock shows now  and these guys are  pretending to be rock stars.  I know Steve-O doesn't  play an instrument or sing,  but he's a rock star.  This is how these guys  used to be.  You know, now you go backstage  and these guys are eating  their tofu as they're all  tatted up and got piercings.  Look at you sitting there  with your granola and fruit bowl. 
[01:16:30]  I never claimed to be  a rock star.  It's just funny when you're  talking about that.  Look over and see like that.  It's still cut oatmeal.  No, I never claimed to be  a rock star, but I'm just  saying how it has changed  because we have been  doing radio a long time.  We've been going to  a lot of concerts  and back in the day,  you know, call it 15 years ago,  you still had guys  that were the real deal  and now you go back there  and I don't even want  to be there anymore.  We went to OzFest  like two years ago  and all these bands  that supposedly are 
[01:17:00]  devil worshippers  and tough  and it's all about Satan,  they're eating vegetarian meals  and drinking  Poland Springs water  and they're all tatted up  and they're just like,  I don't know.  When was the last time  anybody drowned  in a pool of their own vomit?  I missed that.  Where is that?  Every 18 months  somebody did it.  Someone choked  on their own vomit.  Actually, the dude  from Drowning Pool  who we interviewed  very close to his death.  Oh, they figured out  that he died from drugs?  Well, I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  He was throwing up  and stuff.  Yeah.  He had one of those  old school  choked on vomit.  Rock deaths.  And he was a really,  really good guy.  It wasn't his own vomit.  You can't dust for vomit.  Anyway.  I love that.  Spinal tap.  Do you guys want an update  on the pitch thing?  Oh, we got updates?  I got a couple emails  overnight.  The A&E thing, right?  Yeah, and we brought  everyone into this  so we got to give updates now.  And you want to just  give the synopsis  in case people didn't hear  just a really quick thing  as I find these emails.  A production company 
[01:18:00]  that contacted us  about a year ago  with an idea  for a television show  that they wanted  me and Opie  to participate in.  Well, after a year  they get in touch  with us again  because they said  A&E.  A&E is interested  to hear the pitch.  So we went down there  for the pitch  and it just,  from mine and Opie's  point of view,  it did not go very well.  Oh, it was a train wreck.  It was a disaster. 
[01:18:30]  Absolutely.  We sat there  and there was really  no interest  from the A&E people.  They were just stone-faced.  Right.  We left there,  tails between our legs.  Me and Opie  were walking back  to uptown here  and just laughing  at the whole thing  because it was a mess.  We basically,  just to reiterate,  we basically pitched  Mythbusters meets  Jackass to A&E.  And they looked at us  like you're wasting our time.  Like you were pitching  Mythbusters meets Jackass.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, thank you, Bill. 
[01:19:00]  And then when we were  walking home laughing  for 30 blocks  and I were like,  yeah, you know,  we were pitching Mythbusters  with lawsuits.  With lawsuits.  And Jackass,  you just don't say that  in any TV pitch meeting.  No, they don't hear it.  Because there's all sorts  of problems associated  with that show now  because of lawsuits  and kids killing themselves.  You will not see  a Jackass-type show  on television.  Anytime soon.  No.  So for us to mention  Jackass in this meeting  was like, ugh,  you know,  away with you guys.  Right.  But the production company  was convinced  that the meeting went well  which Ant and I 
[01:19:30]  were just amazed at  when we were taking  the elevator  back down in the street.  Yeah.  You know,  where the limo  that they got us  was now gone  because they only  ordered the limo  one way.  And this was them  trying to make  an impression on us.  The Christmas cake card  that they brought you all away.  Yeah.  So you know  the basic setup  and a lot of you guys  probably heard  the whole bit yesterday  or the discussion.  And like I said,  complete disaster.  I told our agent,  you know.  Anyway,  I got a communique  from Super Agent 
[01:20:00]  Bob Eatman.  He writes,  well,  well,  just shows you  how networks think.  Imagine if the meeting  had gone well.  You just never know.  Ross,  who's Bob's brother,  said you guys  really did a good job  in the meeting.  And we did.  Of course we did.  Representing ourselves.  We made him laugh  and stuff.  But as far as  fitting into this show,  you know,  obviously that's  where the disaster starts. 
[01:20:30]  So the Super Agent  wrote that  as a little thing  to the email  he forwarded  to Anthony and I  this morning.  This is the email  that he got.  From the production company.  From the production company.  Just got a call  from the A&E execs.  They really want this.  We'll talk more tomorrow.  But they get it  and need to know  what XM wants  out of the deal  and are prepared to play.  They will want to go  to Arable Pilot.  We are working.  What's an Arable Pilot,  Bill?  You've been around  a long time.  They want to make  an Arable Pilot? 
[01:21:00]  Arable Pilot.  A Pilot is basically  you do a show  and you hand it in  and then they go,  well,  all right,  I guess we could  throw this on TV, right?  Yeah, but  it's kind of a demo  of the show.  Who sits down and goes,  I want to make  an un-Arable Pilot.  Right.  I want to make  such a steaming  pile of shit.  It could not  possibly air.  Yeah, we can't  put this on TV.  That's our goal here,  people.  Of course,  an Arable Pilot.  Putting Arable in there  is a filler word. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  But listen to the  BS that comes through  on this email.  It's just amazing to me.  Just got a call  from the A&E execs.  They really want this.  He didn't get a call  from the A&E.  Okay, that's what  you're going to do that?  Yeah, he didn't get  a call from the A&E execs.  They couldn't wait  for us to leave  the conference room.  They really want this.  We'll talk more tomorrow.  We will?  I'm sure he's going  to want to.  Be more bullshit.  We won't be talking 
[01:22:00]  with this guy.  Oh, he was talking  to Bob, though.  Oh, okay.  We'll talk more tomorrow,  but they get it  and need to know  what XM wants  out of the deal  and are prepared  to play.  They will want  to go to  Arable Pilot.  We are working  on slightly altering  the show.  Slightly.  Remember the discussion  yesterday?  This thing was a disaster.  There was nothing usable.  I said they needed  a machete to the jugular,  if you remember. 
[01:22:30]  Slightly altering.  We are working  on slightly altering  the show  to make it  less jackass.  He's still obsessed  with jackass.  Less jackass.  How about  none jackass?  Yeah, did you get it,  you ass?  No jackass.  None more jackass.  None more jackass.  We want to make it  less suable.  Small claims court.  Yeah.  Misdemeanor.  Once we can tweak,  we'll get it to the net  for final approval.  And I'm taking a bit 
[01:23:00]  from Anthony and Jim.  This is huge!  because there's a lot  of exclamation points.  Exclamation points.  Get the boys excited!  There's like 10 exclamation  points after these.  Again,  we'll talk tomorrow!  So,  liar,  whore,  liar,  whore,  you know it!  So I got this yesterday  and I wrote Bob back  immediately  and I said,  Bob,  they are completely  delusional at this point 
[01:23:30]  and I'm getting a little scared  that we're even involved  with people like this.  And I just left a message.  He calls back  because,  you know,  he's out there in LA  so he listens to the replay  of the show  and he was like,  hi,  Opie.  You know,  he's a dullard to begin with.  He's like,  dullard.  Hi,  Opie.  I just heard  the recap on the meeting  and I,  I guess I get it now.  Thank God for this show.  We didn't have to call Bob  and say that  because we would have had to 
[01:24:00]  done yesterday's first hour  on the phone with Bob.  But now we just  throw it all on the radio.  But now business,  that's so much easier  to get it out.  Our business is now  on the radio.  We have,  we hold meetings  on the radio.  That would be like  your new relationship.  Hey,  I'll listen to this show tomorrow  and I'll hear  what you guys have.  No,  hear our side  of the whole thing.  Right.  And,  and Robert's completely,  you know,  you know,  competent,  but he just misread this one  in my opinion,  you know,  because this guy's  such a good BS-er.  And then he talked  to his brother 
[01:24:30]  and he's got the full story now  and he's like,  all right,  I'll,  I'm going to,  you know,  talk to,  he's going to personally  talk to A&E  to see what is bullshit  and what's not.  That's what he needs to do.  What he's going to do today.  But the reality is  we're going to be completely right,  Anthony and I.  There is a slight possibility  they liked us as personalities  and the chemistry we have maybe  and the success we've had  on the radio  might make them think,  is there anything here  that we could build?  Anything arable?  Yeah,  right.  Arable.  But as far as us hosting  this particular show,  I,  I think we're going to come out 
[01:25:00]  the winners in this one  and be completely right.  So that wasn't good enough.  That was yesterday's email.  This morning at like five,  I don't know,  five fifty in the morning,  the guy from the production  company writes me  an email personally.  Oh,  you got it too,  Anthony.  Yeah.  Me,  Anthony,  and of course our agent.  Guys,  this,  this email  just makes me laugh  on so many levels.  When did this come in  this morning?  Yeah,  five fifty or whatever.  We received an unsolicited 
[01:25:30]  phone call.  What does that mean?  Unsolicited.  Like,  you hear all these words  he uses?  That means,  terrible pilot,  unsolicited.  Out of nowhere,  his phone rang.  He wasn't even  approaching people.  He wasn't on TV  going,  call the number  1-800.  Call me now.  An unsolicited,  unsolicited phone call.  I never got the  unsolicited phone call.  I didn't even  ask for it.  I'm sitting there,  my phone rang,  and I went,  who the fuck 
[01:26:00]  could this be?  Because I'm not even  expecting a call.  The only way  that makes sense  is if you look  at the phone  and go,  ring right now.  ring.  Oh,  hey.  There's a solicited  phone call.  There's a solicited  phone call.  Right?  I'm expecting  your call.  No,  unsolicited phone call.  All right,  guys,  we received  an unsolicited  phone call  from blank  last night  from A&E.  What you need  to know  is that the  three people  in the meeting  with us  are the three  people who  make the  programming  decisions  at A&E. 
[01:26:30]  We know  that.  Blank  is blank's  right-hand  person.  In yesterday's  Variety  was a huge  article  about A&E's  direction  and the only  three execs  named were  blank,  blank,  and blank.  All three  took part  in our  meeting.  He was very  excited,  but they were  all there.  But they were  all there to  meet us.  Right.  And he doesn't  understand that  yet.  Meh.  Rob confirmed  that,  well,  there goes  that name.  Rob confirmed  that he loves  the boys 
[01:27:00]  and the show  and is going  to work  quickly and  hard with  us to tweak  the concept  so it doesn't  seem  jack-ash-ish.  That will  pull the  woman,  who's the  big  muckety-muck,  over to our  side without  any hesitation.  She ain't  coming for  nothing.  This is the  woman that  was so  bothered  right off  the bat.  And she's  the head  one there.  She was 
[01:27:30]  the one  that needed  to be  impressed.  Oh,  she had  the watch  that she  kept  jingling,  jangling  watch.  The chandelier  with a face.  The jingle  jangle.  Right.  That will  pull her  over to  our side.  And this  is where  the BS,  it just  comes  bleeding  through  without  any  hesitation.  Because he  knows we  saw  complete  hesitation  in that  meeting.  Of course.  Rob,  because we  already blew  his name,  Rob is now  talking about  an arable  pilot.  You sure 
[01:28:00]  he didn't  want to  write  terrible?  And it  just like  skipped and  arable came  out?  Is it  air or  arable?  That might  have just  been him  missing a  couple of  letters.  Rob is now  talking about  an arable  pilot.  This is  huge.  We just  did an  arable pilot  for the  Travel Channel  and it was  so good they  picked up the  13 show series  immediately.  We don't  know.  Who knows?  I'm taking  a jump right  here.  I'm going  to take a  leap of  faith.  It is a 
[01:28:30]  TV production  house.  They had  to produce  something.  We just  don't know  what.  We can't  find any  credits for  this company.  We know  that we  will blow  A&E's  heads off  when we  go to  arable  pilot  production.  See,  that's just  promising the  world.  Right.  Again,  we're going  to sell  more DVDs  than  Chappelle.  That's  embarrassing.  There's  nothing to  back that.  That's  just like...  Yeah.  You know?  You've got  to back  this stuff up  with cold  hard facts.  How do  you know  so clearly 
[01:29:00]  they have  been discussing  this behind  the scenes  after our  meeting.  I agree  with that.  I believe  they're discussing  us and  them and  the pitch  and everything.  And how  it's going  to go down  as one of  the top  five worst  pitches of  all time.  Oh,  we'll be  the talk  of the  Christmas  party this  year.  I absolutely  believe it.  As a matter  of fact,  Opie,  there was a  tape recorder  running when  we left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ha ha ha ha.  That's 
[01:29:30]  terrific.  That's  terrific.  I got an  idea for a  show I want  to pitch.  Yeah?  Who wants  to be a  millionaire  meets  Jackass.  You ask  them questions,  right?  And then as  they're trying  to think,  you take a  razor and  you take  clumps of  their hair  out of  their head  to distract 
[01:30:00]  them.  Out of  Regis'  head.  Yeah.  It only  works if  it's  Regis.  And you  give the  contestant  paper cuts  between their  fingers.  As you're  trying to  answer the  million dollar  question,  you're hanging  from an  alligator pit  on a rope  in just  your underwear  and you  have meat  products hanging  from your  crotch.  your question,  what is  the capital  of Iowa?  What is  the capital  of Iowa?  Oh, I  just shot him  in his  bulletproof  vest. 
[01:30:30]  He's got  quite a  welt over  there.  Final answer,  he's getting  up off the  ground.  All right,  this is  almost done.  Trust me,  there's a  great grand  finale for  everybody.  So clearly,  they have  been discussing  this behind  the scenes  after our  meeting.  They want  to move  this forward  and we  will make  it  priority  one.  To get  back to  them ASAP  with the  minor,  he has  an exclamation  points there.  Minor.  Minor  modifications. 
[01:31:00]  Minor.  You need  a whole new  fucking idea.  Right.  It's got to  be an  entirely new  idea because  they were  not biting  at all.  At all.  It was so  bad that  Anthony and  I now have  to separate  and pitch  individual  TV pilots  for anything  to work.  For anything  to work,  it can't  even include  the two  of us  anymore.  You know  what that's  like?  His excitement  is like the  first time you  ever take a  meeting and  you actually  believe everything  that they're  saying.  Everything you  heard because  you have  nothing else to 
[01:31:30]  base it on.  It's your  first meeting.  You're excited  just that it's  your first meeting.  They told me  that they love  me.  They're really  excited to  work with me.  I see big  things for you.  This happens,  by the way,  throughout most  everybody's entire  life.  Just not on  maybe the  level of a  television show,  but it's  school,  being accepted  to schools,  things like  that.  It's just  the bullshit  you get,  the disappointment.  You ever  been in a  band?  You ever  been in a  local band?  You have  the guitar  player will 
[01:32:00]  send tapes  out and  go,  dude,  I know  the guy  that works  for a guy  over at  Capitol  Records or  whatever record  company at the  time.  He's going  to listen to  the tape and  I think we're  going to be  signed.  He's totally  into us.  He's so into  the fucking  thing and it  just never pans  out and  everybody in the  band is sitting  there dreaming  and thinking  this is going  to go somewhere.  After a while  you realize it's  just bullshit.  If we took  this meeting six  or seven years  ago we would  be buying into  this entire 
[01:32:30]  thing and all  these emails  without a doubt.  How long ago?  Five, six years  ago?  Yeah, okay,  years.  I thought you  said months.  Oh, no, no,  no, not at  all.  By the way,  there is a  show, Who  Wants to Be a  Millionaire Meets  Jackass?  Nathaniel just  found it.  Wow, Nathaniel.  What is this  show all about?  It's called  Distraction.  It's on Comedy  Central.  Yeah.  It's basically  just asking people  trivia questions  but I guess  here's a clip  of people having  to down hot  sauce right before  they do it.  Someone actually  bought Millionaire 
[01:33:00]  Meets Jackass.  What happened?  It's unreal.  See, I'm in the  wrong business.  I need to be the  new Mark Burnett.  I just threw  that out as a goof  and the show's  on out there.  I didn't see it  on the side of  the bus.  Right.  I didn't see it.  Motherfucker.  Bastards.  How come  Mythbusters doesn't  work with  Jackass but  Millionaire does?  Especially now  with all these  reality shows  being picked up.  You can have  the dumbest  concept ever and  I'll say it to  my agent and be  like, yeah,  somebody already  pitched that.  It's already done.  No matter what  it's already been  approved. 
[01:33:30]  It's fucking  unbelievable.  It's like anybody  can sell a show  now.  All right.  Just take every  show, write it  down on a piece  of paper, just go  through the TV  listings and then  divvy them up, put  half in one hat,  half in the other.  Hey, let's do  that.  Pull two out.  Let's do that  now.  Make a show out of  it.  Mutual of Omaha's  Wild Kingdom  meets the  Hollywood Squares.  Yeah.  You sit there  and you try to  answer questions  and there's a  cobra sitting on 
[01:34:00]  your desk.  Ant, you're  brilliant.  Exactly.  You're brilliant.  That's how you  make a show.  Go and get a  bunch of TV shows,  throw them in a  hat, we'll pull  out two.  We will come up  with a TV pitch.  We'll pitch one.  That is how you  do.  I want to see  Discovery Wings  channel, Wings of  the Luftwaffe,  Will and Grace.  How do you put  those two shows  together?  How do you do  it?  Gay guys.  We don't have  to worry about  that.  Gay guys with  their sharp,  dressy, Nazi 
[01:34:30]  uniforms on.  Feed seagulls down  on Coney Island.  There you go.  Pitch it.  Hey, and he's  clamoring.  Every week, man,  it's a different  seagull.  You can just see  this, man.  You'll get 100  episodes.  We're on it.  I see the side  of the bus.  We're on it.  We're going to get  a bunch of TV  listings together.  Nice.  We'll come up with  something that makes  sense.  We'll do our  own TV pitch.  All right, so  really fast.  So I did that.  Okay.  I'm going to have  to read this  whole paragraph  again. 
[01:35:00]  So clearly, they  have been discussing  this behind the  scenes after our  meeting.  They want to  move this forward  and we will make  it a priority one  to get back to  them ASAP with  the minor  modifications to  make this happen.  Bob, which is  our super agent,  they were curious  as to what XM  would want in  return.  And we're  willing to  consider their  needs.  See, what he's  trying to do is  drag in XM  to get more  heat.  Right.  So he looks  even more  powerful.  You know, because  he looked pretty  powerful to, you  know, not to  pat ourselves on 
[01:35:30]  the back, but to  bring Opie and  Anthony into this  discussion.  Now it's like,  that wasn't good  enough.  Let's now bring  XM into it.  Let's get XM  involved.  And now A&E is  going to go,  well, we can get  some advertising  on XM.  Sends over a box  of those red hats.  Right, those red  XM hats.  Thank God you  said red, Bill.  Thank you.  This is the only  time we'll ever  wear this hat.  We could give  him some of those  seat cushions for  the sporting  events.  In a tropical  storm, you were  just standing  outside in that  fucking thing, and  then you jumped 
[01:36:00]  in a dryer.  All right,  sorry.  All right,  that's very good.  Yeah, I mean,  XM, you know,  if we do a TV  show, XM would  just be like,  yeah, that's cool.  And the TV  networks, they  just get it.  They know, like,  we would talk  about a TV  show on our  show a lot.  So they don't  need to really  wonder what XM's  participation would  be.  That's just  completely ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Tom in Tennessee,  go ahead. 
[01:36:30]  Hey, what's  going on, guys?  Distraction was  the funniest shit  in the world, man.  I used to watch  it a lot, but  because if they  win a car,  they wouldn't  win like a  million dollars,  they win a car.  And at the  that's the guy  that won  questions.  And every  question he got  wrong, the  contestants that  lost got to  fuck the car  up, like smash  the windows or  pour paint on  it, shit like  that, cut the  seats up.  Yeah, that's  pretty funny.  Your prize is  the car, and  every time you  fuck up, they  fuck your car  up.  That's pretty  funny.  I like that. 
[01:37:00]  See, where was  that idea?  Very good.  All right, man.  How about  Mythbusters meets  Queer Eye?  Queer Eye for  the Mythbuster.  I like it.  Queer Eye for  the Mythbuster.  See, you could  throw that on  the side of a  bus.  It's homosexual  myths.  Like you take  the guy with  the gerbil up  the ass, and  then the guy  that went to  find it, so  he lit a  match, and  it fired the  gerbil out his  ass into the  other guy's  face, and they  both ended up  at the hospital. 
[01:37:30]  One guy with  third degree  burns and a  broken nose on  his face, the  other guy with  third degree  burns in his  intestine and  his ass.  And he wrote  the thing  lighting, in  hindsight, lighting  the match was  a bad idea.  Unfortunately,  that's the only  gay myth we  can think of.  Any other  gay myths?  It'll be a  short series.  I don't think  so.  All right, so  side of the  bus?  I don't see it.  Gerbil.  Yeah.  Bob, they  were curious as  to what XM  would want in  return.  That's not  true.  And were  willing to  consider their 
[01:38:00]  needs.  This all points  to a real desire  on their part to  move this forward.  Do you get to  the point of  working out some  kind of advertising  deal between the  two companies  before you even  have a viable  idea for a  program?  Before you even  think that you  are going to  work with people?  Do you start  doing that?  He just goes  in there and  just starts  spinning plates.  That's what  he's trying to  keep the  shit going. 
[01:38:30]  One stole it  down.  Get it.  Get it.  Oh, crap,  man.  Unbelievable.  All right.  This is horrible.  It's embarrassing.  Dude, the  last paragraph  just sums it  all up.  This all points  to a real desire  on their part  to move this  forward.  I'm assuming  XM will be  tickled to have  the boys on a  90 million sub  network with  gobs.  He wrote the  word gobs. 
[01:39:00]  With gobs of  primetime TV  exposure.  Primetime.  He's already  got the slot for  this.  This is a parody  of what actually  happens with  real celebrities  and TV pitches  right out the  door.  He's already  got primetime,  so it's primetime.  It's going to be  airing in primetime.  We're on.  We're working out  the deal with  XM and A&E.  With gobs of  primetime TV  exposure, but  again, A&E will  play ball with  them.  Uh-huh.  I don't get how 
[01:39:30]  this can be.  I'm getting the  douche chills.  Yeah.  Like you wouldn't  believe.  We should all feel  in capital letters  damn good about  this.  We are moments  away from a  damn deal with  A&E.  Wait, from a  damn deal?  Moments away.  We are now  moments away from a  damn deal.  You are now  lying.  You are now  lying.  Read it for  yourself.  It absolutely  does not say  that.  We should all  feel damn 
[01:40:00]  good about  this.  We are moments  away from a  damn deal with  A&E.  Moments?  Dude, you know  how many of these  guys are out there?  You know how many  people are just  bullshitters?  They bullshit  through their  lives.  They are  pathological  liars.  We had a guy  Steve Russo  from Restaurant  Records that  put out our  CD.  Holy shit.  He was this  guy ripped from  the same mold.  Oh my god.  Just the ultimate  hype man.  Just the same 
[01:40:30]  guy and they  all almost look  the same.  It's like the  same mold.  And before you  start doing  business with  anybody, especially  in the entertainment  business, you kind  of ask around and  see what they've  done.  So we asked  Steve,  he wanted to  represent us.  Thank god we  didn't.  The big meeting  that took place  where he was  going to try to  convince us to  be represented  by him.  To sign with  him, yeah.  Happened in a  food court in a  mall with a  real big black  guy as his  muscle. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  He was basically  trying to make a  sign like a, I  don't know, a  hip-hop contract.  We were  forcing us to  sign or something.  Did they hang  you out of a  window?  Yeah.  We were supposed  to be paid for  CD sales and we  were like, there  better be about  $10,000 each, a  check when we  get to the food  part.  This is when we  sent out our  Dementor World CD.  To this day we've  sold close to  100,000 copies.  It did very well.  It just went nuts and  we were doing CD  signings that were  anywhere from four to  eight hours.  All day.  There were some  Saturdays.  We were at a mall  all day signing.  All day doing  signing.  Money's rolling in. 
[01:41:30]  So we expect, he  goes, I got  checks for you  guys and I got  the contract because  he was just pushing  us to sign with  him.  So we're like,  all right, we'll  meet you because we  want the fucking  checks.  Meanwhile, the  contract, me and  Open Talk, I'm  going, this guy's  shady, man.  I ain't signing  with him.  Is that why you  picked a public  place?  Yeah.  That's a good  way to do it.  Public place.  Hold on.  I just got back  up, but we're  like, well, before  we sign with you,  who else do you  represent?  You know?  Yeah.  He was doing  these silly little  CDs for radio  stations and  stuff.  You know, whatever. 
[01:42:00]  That's low-level  crap that almost  anyone can do.  He goes, well, I  represent Bozo the  Clown.  He was excited  because he just  picked up Bozo.  Bozo the Clown.  He had just  picked up Bozo the  Clown.  Bozo.  So we did our  research.  I don't remember.  No, I don't  remember.  I did our, we  did our research.  I'm not sure he  was either.  Well, okay.  We think the  original Bozo  died.  He did.  Okay.  The real Bozo  was dead.  He went to  high school  with me.  Yeah, me and  Bozo used to  hang. 
[01:42:30]  So he wasn't  even representing  the Bozo.  He was  representing the  Bozo the  Clown.  The replacement  Bozo.  The new Bozo  the Clown.  And he was  like trying to  make this sound  good.  Like, guys, I  just picked up  Bozo.  Bozo.  Bozo.  Bozo the Clown.  So we're like,  all right, well.  Gallagher Part 2.  He sold his act  to his brother.  And you know,  everyone, you  know, you give  your best.  So he represents  other people.  It's downhill from  the replacement  Bozo. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, it has to  be.  So like, what  else have you  done, Steve?  You know?  And he goes,  you know that  song?  You remember  this one,  Ant?  You know that  song?  Na-na-na-na.  Hey-hey.  Goodbye.  Na-na-na-na.  You hear it at  all sporting  events?  It's like, wow,  wait, wait, did  he write it?  I'm like, wow,  all right.  Why are you?  Well, let's  listen a little  closer here.  He goes, I was  in the recording  studio when that  band was recording 
[01:43:30]  that song.  And do you know  they didn't have a  name at the time?  And they were  all trying to  think up a name.  So we're standing  there for hours  trying to think up  a name.  Just trying to  figure it out.  And at some  point I turned  because I heard  this hissing noise  and it was one  of those old  style radiators  on the wall.  Some people like  to say radiators.  Radiator,  radiator, one of  those old style.  And it was  letting off some  steam like they  usually do.  And I turned to  the guys and said,  guys, how about  steam?  And everyone went, 
[01:44:00]  that's great.  That's perfect.  And the name of  the band is  Steam.  You know, I'm  picturing the whole  time he's telling  this story, people  walking behind him  like with trays  of orange chicken  at the food court.  Sitting down at  the seat.  Eating.  Angie, get me  some more napkins.  This guy's trying  to come up like  a big shot.  Like a big shot.  Plastic swivel chair.  You know what's  great?  A lot of people  look into our lives  and we've got fan  sites and stuff  and we've had a lot  of success, obviously. 
[01:44:30]  But they have no  idea how ridiculous  it really is.  The crap you go  through.  So we're sitting  in this food court.  And we continue  to go through crap.  It just gets a little  better as you move  forward in your  career.  Dude, Seinfeld goes  to meetings and  goes, oh my god,  what the fuck  waste the time with  that.  It just keeps  happening.  So we're sitting  in this food court.  We're there to get  our checks.  The whole drive  there also, me and  Opia going, this  motherfucker, this  better be at least  ten grand each.  We made our own 
[01:45:00]  deal there, Bill.  Oh, we didn't sign  anything, but we made  our own deal.  No, it's a handshake.  We were going to  split 75 cents a CD.  Because it's 1879, and  a handshake is good  enough here on this  farm.  We decided we were  just, you know, we'll  handshake this through.  That's how smart your  pals are.  We don't need to sign  anything.  You seem like a good  guy.  No payment schedule on  delivery of CDs, blah,  blah, blah.  75 cents a CD.  And I would split, so  that's 37 and a half  cents per dish.  We were selling CDs in 
[01:45:30]  the Boston area like  hot cakes, Bill.  Hot cakes.  Hot cakes.  Where did you  shake?  With merchandise.  Posters in the  parking lot of a  ground round.  Sounds good to me.  Exactly.  This is how stupid we  were.  Posters and t-shirts  with our likeness on  them.  Oh, and those were  selling like  And he'd be in the  corner at these  signings.  We're signing for  hours on end.  He's in the corner,  and all you would see  is the back of him,  and you'd see his 
[01:46:00]  elbows moving in the  corner, and you'd  hear, and then you'd  see him like fold  something and stick a  wad in his front  pocket.  Guys, you're doing a  great job.  Doing a great job.  We're moving things.  All cash that we  never saw.  All cash we never  saw.  Dime one of the  t-shirt or poster  sales.  Hundreds, maybe even  over a thousand.  Dude, how many times  a signing would he go  to that corner?  And his elbows, you 
[01:46:30]  just see elbows moving.  And we're sitting  there looking over  like, we've got to  get a piece of this  someday.  We shook hands.  So then, finally, we're  starting to get bitter  after doing it.  Probably close to ten of  these, you know, CD  signs and, you know,  just a madhouse at  these places.  We wanted our money  is what it came down  to.  We need money.  All right, we'll meet  you at the food  court.  Food court for the  money.  Was this guy dressed  like Boss Hogg?  He was in a white  on white suit.  You know what he was  exactly like? 
[01:47:00]  He was exactly like  this new guy.  Yeah.  It's the same guy.  And this is like  seven years ago.  Anyone in entertainment  knows this guy.  Anyone in entertainment  has been with this guy,  has sat down to  meetings with him,  and the ones that  haven't found them  out get fucked in  deals for years.  I think there's a lot  of these people in  whatever business you  do.  The bullshitter.  The bullshitter.  So we go to the table.  We want our money. 
[01:47:30]  At the food court.  He's got the contract.  We haven't been paid  yet.  Envelopes.  He's got some  envelopes.  So now I'm just  staring at that.  Now I'm fucking  livid pissed.  I'm just staring at  the fucking envelope.  He's talking about  how he wants us to  sign this contract.  It's a five-year  fucking deal that this  guy wants to sign us  to.  There's no way in  hell I'm signing  to represent us.  And to represent us  he's representing  Bozo and us.  Came up with the  name for Steam.  Yeah.  Steam.  Came up with the  name for Steam. 
[01:48:00]  I'm staring at the  envelope.  Finally he slides the  envelope over to us.  I open this thing up.  Now I'm thinking  in the whole drive in  I'm going if this is  less than ten grand  I am fucking walking  away from the table.  I want my fucking  ten G's from this CD  sale.  I open it up.  There is a check in  there for one thousand  dollars.  I'd have been pissed  with nine thousand  nine hundred ninety  nine dollars.  That's the line.  And it was a non-negotiable  line in my head.  It had to be ten grand 
[01:48:30]  or I was living pissed.  It was a thousand  dollars.  Before taxes.  And the second  I tipped the envelope  open and saw the  amount he starts making  excuses and how I'm  going to get more  money.  We had to put in  another order which  took up the money  that was there like  blob and in my head  it was wah wah wah wah  wah wah wah wah wah  wah wah wah.  I don't want to hear  it.  Phil when I tell you  what did you say to  the guy?  Not a word.  We just sat there.  I sat back.  We both folded our  arms.  I folded my arms. 
[01:49:00]  I sat back in the  chair put a hmm look  on my face and just  stared at him as he is  now going into why we  should sign with him.  Why we should sign.  But he has to know  he's bombing at this  point.  He is tanking.  Tanking.  Oh yeah.  And it reached the  point where I stood up  we got up and walked.  That was it.  And you didn't say  anything to him.  That I believe was the  last we saw of Steve  Russo.  I think we ended up  seeing him once in New  York or something.  I never said another  word to him.  Yeah.  We just. 
[01:49:30]  So then we start  telling these stories on  the air.  On the air back at  N.E.W.  Then he paid us a  little bit like a  couple checks came in  but not.  Not even up to the  thousand dollars mark.  No.  Just a little pittance.  Okay.  So we go on the air.  Wait a minute.  You don't have a  contract with this guy.  No.  We shook hands.  So.  It was done through  the radio station.  Fucking Dave Dickless.  Another reason why we  hate that fucking  asshole.  Yeah.  It was in cooperation  with the radio station.  It was in cooperation  with the radio station.  So for us to actually  sign a deal with the  record company guy. 
[01:50:00]  This shyster.  Would have taken the  radio station out of  the mix.  And we're so naive at  the time.  We assumed that the  radio station had their  shit in order.  And you know we were  going to get paid  because the station  was going to work out  some kind of deal.  It's a classic example  of watch your own  fucking ass.  And we didn't.  Thank God it was very  early in our careers and  it wasn't such a huge  deal.  This wasn't you know  fucking Skid Row's  first album.  You know that kind of  deal where we're losing  millions of dollars.  You know we took a hit.  A few grand. 
[01:50:30]  You know what this  business is like.  Anytime you got some  cash coming towards you  it's like right almost  the second you're going  to be able to grasp it.  Like 20 guys stand in  front of it and have it  pass through for half a  second and take that  chunk.  You see that stack go  down around there.  What happened?  You're like what the  fuck happened?  As a single bill flutters  to your feet.  You end up looking at  your bank account and  it's like did I go on  like a crack binge and  like buy like 20 people  a grand piano last night?  What happened?  Where the fuck did all  my money go?  What happened?  These agents you know 
[01:51:00]  they take a percentage  that is beyond ridiculous.  I used to have this  guy on ridiculous but  you have no choice in  the matter.  When I was in Boston  I used to be this guy  used to like videotape  comedians.  This guy was fucking  horrible.  I mean like you would  go on stage and you  would fucking destroy  and like the audio  would be fucked up.  He would sit there  like all he had to do  was just filming you  and you'd be on stage  and somehow you'd hear  him.  He'd start getting into  a conversation with  somebody and you're  watching the tape.  You're killing and  then you walk out of  frame and you're like  a fucking eight year old 
[01:51:30]  could do this shit.  Follow me.  Follow me around.  So then you would get  there and when he would  like break down how  much you were going to  pay you know he'd be  like okay it was you  know $70 for this  $25 for this and then  there was always this  extra like little fuck  charge in the end that  just made no sense and  when he would present it  to you he would go into  the character of a  scumbag.  He would be like and  then you know there's a  little you know 25%  surcharge and he'd do  this little fucking  and it's like dude why  are you going into a  why are you going into a  character of a scumbag? 
[01:52:00]  You are a scumbag.  You don't need to  pretend like hey he's  doing this little  pretending to play with  you know how it is  huh?  Yeah like oh what a  dick.  And that was like the  beginning where I was  just so naive it's like  I'm getting fucked right  now I don't know how  How do I get unfucked?  Yeah the only thing I  know how to do is  respond in anger like  that was the only thing I  learned in my family is  like I can't put this  guy in a headlock and  just start punching him  in the head.  I don't I didn't have  any business skills to be  like dude you're  fucking me what is this  for?  Yeah this is bullshit.  Stop your act tell me  what this charge is right  and you're just okay and 
[01:52:30]  the greatest thing is the  first time you do that  they immediately implode and  be like okay I'll get  rid of that charge but  don't don't don't tell  anybody else.  Hey hey don't hey hey  I'm just doing this for  you yeah.  Meanwhile he's selling it  like it's gonna look like  an HBO one night stand or  something.  So get three cameras shoot.  So getting back to the  Steve guy and our CD and  not getting paid and all  that and finally you know we  have a falling out which  should have happened a lot  earlier.  We go on the air and we  start talking about it  because we talk about all  this shit and we're  talking about how this guy's  not paying us and we  we spent you know a lot 
[01:53:00]  of hours you know putting  this thing together and  you know blah blah blah  blah and so then he  calls us up and goes well  now that you're talking  badly about me on the air  about how I'm not paying  you.  Now I'm not paying you.  Now I'm not paying you.  It's like he wasn't  paying us.  The man had no intention  at all.  Ever.  To pay us ever.  But now he had an  excuse.  But now he wasn't paying  us.  Now he finally had an  excuse.  You guys talking about me  now you know what?  Now you don't get paid.  Now you don't get paid. 
[01:53:30]  It goes down to some of  the dumbest things ever  said to Opie and Anthony.  Like he's sitting in  front of the radio writing  the big check for us.  Yeah.  All right.  Pay to the order of  Anthony.  Go me a.  What?  What?  They're talking.  That's it.  Now.  Now.  I'm not paying you.  Now that you're on stage  saying that I'm a piece  of shit.  I'm really going to live  up to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Continue behaving like  you scumbag.  So honestly.  Steve Russo.  This CD that was just  beyond successful could 
[01:54:00]  have even been more  successful because when  we moved to New York he  just didn't have enough  resources to print up  any you know make any  more for the New York  area.  It was a no brainer.  No brainer.  To put this out in New  York.  And to this day well we  haven't been paid in  five six years now.  I don't know five years  easily.  Panera's on CNBC right  now.  Is he?  If you want to change it  over.  Go to CNBC really fast.  Fan CNBC.  CNBC.  That's M.  M. 
[01:54:30]  Oh no.  Then you don't know  the channel.  You don't know CNBC do  you?  Hawk.  Oh boy.  Let's go.  E.T.  USA.  Oh great.  Bravo.  Oh A&E.  Fifteen.  Fifteen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That don't look like  that's Arnold Palmer.  Did we miss him?  How about that TV?  We must have missed  him huh?  I don't know.  Did they say that on  the answer feedback?  Yeah it said Q is on CNBC  right now.  Alright well it was  probably a quick  interview.  Great. 
[01:55:00]  XM announced big news  we'll get to that in a  little bit.  Yeah so he you know  Billy goes alright now  I'm not going to pay you  and that was the end of  Russo and to this day I  think we made less than  five thousand each probably  even like.  What do you think he  made?  I have no idea.  A couple hundred?  He made a killing.  He had to have.  I don't you know.  My brother ran into  his crony very recently.  Remember the short guy?  Mark?  Mark.  Ran into his crony very  recently.  He's working some day 
[01:55:30]  jobs somewhere.  Of course he is.  Just like you know.  I used to bitch to  Mark all the time and he  was he was believing in  Steve and I was like man  you're in for a long hard  fall eventually.  So anyway getting back to  the new Steve in our life  this guy with the pitch.  God damn I hope you guys  follow because we go all  over the place.  The rest of this email  it's really fast.  So the A&E deal the TV  pitch you guys know we're  going back to that.  Moments away.  We're moments away.  We should all feel damn  good about this.  We are moments away from a  damn deal with A&E. 
[01:56:00]  Endeavor is poised to work  with Bob and then move the  deal forward in a big way.  In a big way.  Is there any other way to  move a deal forward?  Big.  These are things people use  in emails and when they  talk when they're just  bullshitting to you.  Biller.  All systems and then and  then you get stuff like  this.  All systems are ready for  go.  He's going to go into like  sports cliches.  We're firing on all  cylinders.  It's not all systems are  ready for go. 
[01:56:30]  It's all systems are go.  What can you get the  cliche right?  I know.  It's just about done.  I need a freaking  martini.  It will be a dream to do  this project with you guys.  The constant laughing will  hurt.  Oh wow.  Something will hurt.  Something's going to hurt.  If you need a good laugh  why don't you call A&E  today.  So sit tight and we'll get  the redirect to you  quickly.  Then push it down the  nets.  Then push it down the  nets gullet.  Push it down the nets. 
[01:57:00]  Gullet.  The network.  Yeah.  Push it down their  gullet.  Hey.  Suck on this.  Right.  Like we got the upper  hand here.  Like we got the  biggest fucking thing.  That's when you know  the idea is awful.  You just can't present  it to them.  You got to push it  down their gullet.  Well I don't really  see how that show  works.  Shut the fuck up.  Eat it.  Like when you give a  dog a pill.  You got to hold their  snout shut and rub  their throat.  Hold their head up.  Then push it down. 
[01:57:30]  Take this concept.  Then push it down the  nets gullet and get  ready to go from there.  This is all good.  Call or email me with  any thoughts, questions  or concerns.  When the deal is done.  Still going?  This is how it ends.  When the deal is done.  Okay now we're  predicting a future  again.  When the deal is done  can we all go to the  beach and do mushrooms  to celebrate?  You know that's another  thing that makes me  really nervous about  this guy.  I have never ever had a  conversation with him  that didn't turn into 
[01:58:00]  drinking a lot or  doing drugs.  Well that's the  anxiety in the back of  his subconscious.  Is that it?  He's lying so much  after he just goes  through the whole  hey it's going to be  great right?  And then after he  hits send he just  fucking cries in the  fetal position.  Because reality comes  back.  Yeah every once in a  while it just washes  over.  When he's in the  men's room afterwards  washing his hand and  he looks in the mirror  and catches his eyes  just grabs the sink  and breaks down. 
[01:58:30]  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Oh man.  Oh.  Anyway.  Too goddamn funny.  You know he's right.  I do.  The soap opera continues.  I do laugh so much  it hurts.  Yeah.  We need to share that  with you today.  Alright.  As we go to break 
[01:59:00]  we played Hi Mom  I'm in Jail for  Steve-O.  I want to play the  one that went  horribly wrong.  Oh yeah.  That we wanted to  put on our  Demanding World CD  at the time.  But Dave Dickless  thought it was a  little too mean.  I do think this is  a little too mean.  A little too mean  spirited.  A little too mean.  Another idiot we  listened to for  ten minutes.  Actually started  trying to edit  out God.  In the middle  of our prank  phone calls  we were saying  Jesus.  God damn it.  God damn it.  So all of a sudden  he's in a production 
[01:59:30]  room one day  and we're like  what the fuck  are you doing  to our CD?  It was about  ready to be  mastered and go  off to the CD  printing plant.  Yeah.  And he's in there  trying to edit out  words like God  and Jesus.  And Jesus  because I think  what I think it was  was his wife  was like really  religious  and used to  listen to the show  and tell him  what to tell us  to do  because he was  just like came  off as a real  pussy whipped guy.  The power of the  pussy.  Remember how we  nailed him  when we were  at NEW  and we realized  that he was 
[02:00:00]  getting fired  from AAF  so we had to  sell his house  and we found out  what his address  was of the house  that he was  selling  and sent our  listeners down  there to the  showings of his  house to walk  around in there  and just give him  stupid questions  and call him an  ass.  The best  because trying to  sell your house  and our pests  show up.  Yeah the pests  were just walking  around his house  like with dirty  shoes on his  carpet.  But the best  was he didn't  know he was  getting fired  we got the  inside word  that he was  getting fired  that day later 
[02:00:30]  on or something  so we go on  our show  this is now  we're back on  in Boston  at WBCN  so we're announcing  to all of Boston  because he's known  in the Boston area  that he's getting  fired today  and then we had  people at AAF  that we still knew  and they were  calling us going  dude holy crap  is this true  and I'm like  fuck yeah  it is you  watch  and they were  basically telling us  he's walking  around like  all freaked out  like no  no way  and sweating  stuff  and we broke  the news  to him  and sure enough  later in the day 
[02:01:00]  he was called  into the old  office  old office  can we speak to you  for a minute  yeah exactly  but we were able  to break the news  before he even knew  that made me feel  very very good  about myself  that was a lot  of fun  there was a lot  of payback  in that little  thing we did  just gotta deal  with so many  jackasses  alright we'll go  to break  with Hi Mom  I'm in Jail  this was supposed  to be on one  of our CDs  now we just  know what we're  going to do  we're going to start  throwing a lot  of our stuff  on audible.com 
[02:01:30]  audible.com  is you know  I don't know  they have our  shows there  that you can  download for  a very very  cheap price  but I think  what we need  to do is  start throwing  volumes of  really cool  stuff on there  instead of  just full shows  you know  bits that we  all know  little tidbits  but here's  Hi Mom  I'm in Jail  it's kind of  like the one  you heard  that we played  for Steve-O  but it went  horribly wrong  hello Mark  are you ready  to play  Hi Mom  I'm in Jail  sure

[02:09:00]  that's pretty cool  Genesis Land of Confusion  you're a band and you're like  hey let's do a cover  who would ever think  let's cover Land of Confusion by Genesis  they must have been laughing  when they first started  right  yeah  maybe they did it as a goof or something  yeah  that sounds kind of good  but that's disturbed  and congratulations to those guys  I think they sold like 250,000 copies  of their latest album  first week out  nice  wow  they're back  nice  they never really went away  but they're doing quite well 
[02:09:30]  for themselves  we gotta go right to the hotline  and talk to the big boss  Elo  my boys  how are you  Mr. Bill  how are you sir  I'm doing well  how are you sir  I just want to tell you  it's a treat to have you  and much as you stated earlier  you know  one of the most important things  about baseball and radio  is to make sure  that you have enough runs  at the end of the game  oh  giving it  it's an evil  that was one of my finer moments 
[02:10:00]  in the past couple weeks  I really thought that was very  very insightful  and I appreciate your insight  you know  did a lot of research on that  last night  yeah I was on the internet  at like 3 in the morning  I really take this seriously here  it's so funny  because the boys make fun of that  all the time  and one of the things that happens  is that they  they go  well  let me get this right Eric  if we practice  we actually get better  yeah  like yeah  that's usually the point  and you know  if you get more points  at the end of the game  you usually win  so those are 
[02:10:30]  that's what I get paid  the big bucks  to figure out  yeah dude  it's like  you had me the first time  you just  you don't tell the joke again  again  but see that's the difference Bill  it's not a joke  I actually mean it  hey Elo  were you all watching  Hugh on  what was it  CNBC  yeah  MSNBC  opening the bell  got Ludacris hanging  he's pimping all around the world  yeah  Elo  big news for the XM Nation today  you want to tell it  big news for the XM Nation  yes  the 
[02:11:00]  it announced this morning  that we have a terrific partnership  now with  Direct TV  and  we will have  72 channels  of  XM programming  distributed to the  14.6 million  Direct TV  customers  nationwide  oh  so basically  what that means is  more distribution  is a good thing  another one of those  smart things  that I have to point out  that you did personally  that I  well I can't take credit  all by yourself  yes 
[02:11:30]  hey  now  was that why  Hugh was in town  like  what was that  last week  when we all got together  when we had a clandestine meeting  no  well  it was one of the reasons  for one of  three or four other things  there's still more coming  you know that  always surprises  things in the works  you know that Hugh Canero  refuses to come by  the New York facility  because  we're smart  and we know  when he's in town  that something big  is going down  yeah  so now he has to  like stay away from us  yep  he does  now  what does this mean  what does all this mean 
[02:12:00]  well all  what does really mean  again  is that  if you have direct TV  do you have direct TV  I do not  I told Okie last time  I thought probably you did  but no  if you have direct TV  you sit at your house  and you just go up to  like in the 800s  where the music channels are  and the current provider  is going to go away  and they'll be replaced  by a bunch of our music channels  you know  the decades  rock  pop  country  and then there's going to be  we'll have XM Kids up there  and then we're also going to have  Home Plate  which is our baseball channel 
[02:12:30]  which is one of only two  non-music program channels  and then we're also going to have  the Obi and Anthony show  channel 202  wow  look at that  wow  one of only two  one of only two channels  that are non-music  that are up there  so  and I see the press release  we're mentioning in the press release  it says featuring  talk radio stars  stars  that's right  finally getting rid of the old  shock jock thing  shock jock  shock jock  wow  that is huge news  that's big news  that's a huge hit for us 
[02:13:00]  what's that?  that's a huge hit for us  big for you guys  for the company  and us personally  absolutely  I mean it's just more people  and I've always said it  you know  the dummy across the street  at the Doggy Company  will starting on the second  which I've got a real funny story  about that  but starting on the second  he will always  and I will say it again  always  have fewer listeners  than Opie and Anthony  from this point forward  you're hearing it from the big boss  we will have more listeners  than Howard Stern  forever 
[02:13:30]  forever  forever  how do you like that?  take that  take that  so no  but Hugh's down there  with Ludacris  I don't know if you saw that or not  I missed that  yeah  he's down there  with Ludacris  and  they're opening the NASDAQ  here  that must have looked natural  it did  he felt very comfortable  oh they're ringing the bell  well you don't ring the bell  on NASDAQ  you sign the board  you sign the board  and push a button  or something  yeah  because it's technology now  yeah 
[02:14:00]  you don't ring the bell  so he's going to do  like a Vanna White thing  where he just  like points  hey  she doesn't even turn  the letters anymore  she just like  points  points at it  like an LED screen  right  yeah  something  I don't know  hey that's pretty cool  that's great  so it's very exciting  I think this stuff  will  this stuff's going to  actually start happening  like mid-November  like the 15th  I think is when  all the channels  will appear  and it's great  so our listenership  is going to go way up  way up  way up 
[02:14:30]  I hazard a guess  so we're going to have  to start doing  real radio shows  well we're going to have  to step it up  a little bit  which is why  I requested Bill's  cell phone number  from Ben Sparks  earlier  oh  what does that mean  let the speculation begin  oh boy  the message boy  is going to go nuts now  will you be getting  a celebratory haircut today  I do need a haircut  really bad by the way  you know that joke  is not working anymore  because I saw Elo  there was a bunch of 
[02:15:00]  the lady that's running  the women's channel  and some new marketing guy  what was that other guy there  that guy's Nathaniel Brown  he's our new head  of communications  yeah  wow Nathaniel's working  his way up quickly  through the company  oh it's not our own Nathaniel  oh I thought he was  just going over  everybody's head  our own Nathaniel  still makes $6.50 an hour  and Hugh Pinero  he said I wish  he said I wish  it's not even $6.50 an hour  it's fine  it's kind of a hot topic 
[02:15:30]  a little touch  don't go there right  you do know you're making  a quarter more an hour  than Danny though right  that's what I heard  all right  Danny has scurvy  I guess the quick point  I'm making is  that whole haircut gag  it has to go away  you're getting your hair  cut by someone new  because  oh is he  there's nothing wrong  with it anymore  ruined the whole bit  we're going to have to  come up with another flaw  as long as it lives on  in photoshopped pictures 
[02:16:00]  all over websites  it's still funny  I had a complex  I did have a complex  you did  we'll find another flaw  it's not that hard  I think Bill's  already figured it out  when are you bringing  in your air checks  that my friend  that requires  appreciation  let's bring them in  and be part of the show  I don't know  one late night  one late night  with alcohol induced  you probably can get me  to tell you where they are  but they do exist  and actually I think  some of them exist 
[02:16:30]  online somewhere  all right  you're doing a lot  of interviews today  I'm doing a couple  of the day  this is the most  important one obviously  I like the way he thinks  what I'm spending most  of the day on today  is take five  all right  we won't hang up  on you today  I know  I'm just waiting for it  no  that's why I'm getting  quiet  no that will be nice  when you're waiting  for it's not as much  fun you know  but today's a dry run  for take five  so that's what we're  doing  what is take five  again I don't even  know  that's the women  oh no you didn't 
[02:17:00]  you are the worst man  I absolutely didn't think  we were hanging up  on him today  you stink  let's take five  well it's the whip  click  he just played  right into it  oh oh he is so  pissed right now  he's sitting there  alone  so pissed  all alone  just going  the motherfucker  got me again  what goes through  your head  when that happens  to you  you're pissed  are you embarrassed  though too  does your heat 
[02:17:30]  does your skin  just start to heat up  because you told  him that we  weren't gonna  it's the classic  hostage thing  you go home  today  get dressed  you go home  today  they take him  out  they dress him  in his civilian  clothes  take him out  drive him around  and then drive him  right back to the  cell  wait but you said  I was going home  maybe tomorrow  back in the cell  and then the next  day same thing  get dressed  you go home  today  I'm the biggest  sucker for the  hang up  are you  I just never see  it coming  never  I think Patrice 
[02:18:00]  O'Neal the last  like 9,000 times  I've talked to him  he's hung up on me  about 8,700 times  I love the people  I'll be thinking  your conversation  is going good  all of a sudden  I'll just  I'll get in the middle  of the story  and the second  it starts bombing  it's just dead air  and then you gotta figure  at what point  did he hang up  and I was still  telling that story  how long was I  just talking to myself  and I love the people  that go  I knew that was  gonna happen  I knew it was coming  all awkwardly  I deliberately started  telling a bad story  all awkwardly  like nah I was onto that  I was just playing along  bastard man 
[02:18:30]  I didn't see that coming  I thought you were  asking about take 5  he was gonna explain it  now see  cause I knew  I knew he knew  it was coming  so it's not that  much fun  so then to like  make him think  that we weren't  gonna hang up on  and then it became  fun again  oh is that horrid  an awful man  someone got me  a great one  the other day  I was all excited  about a new computer  and they're like  what are you doing  I said oh you know  I'm psyched man  I just got this new laptop  they go oh yeah  tell me about it  I'm like well  let's get it  and click  I'm like fuck  oh no 
[02:19:00]  you know  the best one  I've ever gotten  you guys know  Joe DeRosa  yeah  oh my god  he got me with the best  like I used to  I got him so bad  I think he was  borrowing somebody's phone  so I hung up on him  and there was like  an audience  so he's just been  plotting  trying for like  8 months  he's been trying  to fucking hang up  on me  so the day after  like I taped  my HBO special  like you know  it went fucking great  I'm like euphoric  right  and he waited  for the perfect moment  to get me all week  and he was like  he was at the show  he's like dude 
[02:19:30]  you did a great job man  I'm telling you  I gotta be honest man  I'm not trying to sound  corny or anything  but that was like  inspirational  watching you  do that shit  you know  but you know  I just wanna  you know  don't hang up on me  I know this is a dumb question  he goes dude  what was going through your head  okay  you're standing backstage  you've worked for this  13 years  what's going through your head  and I'm like  well you know  it's a number of things  you know  you're excited  but you're nervous  click  dude  I laid there  for like fucking  10 minutes  going 
[02:20:00]  that son of  I will never  ever be able  to top that  it was the greatest  oh  I was about  I was about  to launch into  well let me tell you  there  sit on my knee  and let me tell you  about comedy  I was fucking  I even think  I had my hand  behind my head  I was like  stretched out  on the couch  he wants to learn  something from  the master  here  let me fill you in  click  oh yeah  just going to go  into the whole  like Barbara Walters  special  you can't even  look him in the eyes  oh no  you can't look  that person  in the eyes  oh that's rough  no no I gave it up  to him 
[02:20:30]  I didn't call him  back  but when I saw him  he just had this  big fucking shitty  grin on his face  I was like  Joe  that was the  greatest fucking  hang up  I've ever gotten  it was so  it was totally  fed into my ego  it was perfect  I have a different  like take on the  whole hang up thing  I remember  being on the phone  at my house  and my friends  were over  and I was on the  phone with a  girlfriend  and she was  pissed off at me  and gave me  one of those  you know  well you  motherfucker  just go fuck  yourself  click  and hung up  on me 
[02:21:00]  but my friends  are all around  I guess we were  waiting to go out  and I said I had  a call  because I knew  I was in trouble  with her  and so I had  to sit there  and make believe  I was still  talking to her  so my friends  would know  that my chick  just hung up  on me  so it's like  okay  alright baby  yeah  so and  just nothing  on the other end  it's so  and I'm sitting  there like  sweating  and turning  red  because you  have to hurry  up before  they hear  the dial  that horrible  one that's  the off the  hook one  that's too  long  you hear that 
[02:21:30]  through concrete  horrid  embarrassing  let's do  some radio  radio  satellite radio  we were talking  about Bush  yesterday  Anthony  President Bush  was doing  a war  on terror  update  well I saw  he was going  to give  a speech  so I knew  he had to  record it  because obviously  whenever he gives  these speeches  there's all kinds  of new  information coming  out  and things  that the public  wants to know  how the war  is going 
[02:22:00]  and he's always  very informative  with his speeches  up to date  keeps people  yeah  keeps people  all up to date  on what's going  on  oh there's  Hugh  and Ludacris  pressing the button  there it is  Nasdaq's open  I just missed it  I thought that was  Al Sharpton  I'm not even joking  you know when he  fasted  yeah  got all thin  looked horrendous  still had the big  fat head  like everybody  does when they 
[02:22:30]  lose the wave  there was  our CEO  on CNBC  ringing the  Nasdaq bell  or pushing a button  or pointing  whatever the hell  they did  have the big  announcement  and the  Hugh Pinero  there  ringing the bell  pushing the button  whatever they do  on the Nasdaq  stock's got to go up  today right  very exciting  for XM  the last couple days  5 million subscribers  the new deal  with DirecTV  we win  we're moving  we're moving  we win  well we're going  to celebrate a year  at XM Tuesday  I guess 
[02:23:00]  and you look back  and Ant and I  even said  we just got to  give up the first year  and just do what  we do  you know  but we went  from  the company  went from  I guess  officially  it was like  2.2 million  subscribers  when we  started our  first show  and a year  later  one lousy  year later  it's 5 million  you don't find  anywhere else  and there's still dopes  out there  that just are laughing  going yeah  that satellite radio  thing is whatever  yeah  they got like  5 listeners  yeah whatever  and they're promising 
[02:23:30]  at least 6 million  by the end of the year  XM  maybe even like  6.2  something like that  another million  between now  and January 1st  will join the  XM nation  that's unbelievable  unbelievable  unbelievable man  so we got the  Bush speech  and I've heard  this audio Anthony  and it's a lot like  the email from  the dude  oh really  more bullshit  more talking around  we're going to pitch it  everybody's excited  about the war  right  we're going to have  an arable war 
[02:24:00]  an arable war  it's going to be  great  you think he has  that in his speech  there's a bunch of  exclamation points  right there  after a word  we're winning  no that's  that's when he nods  he always lunges  his head out  lunges his head  forward  there's a hurricane  stealing the Joe  Rogan lunge  I'm ripping him off  call me the  punisher  I'm the punisher  very good  punisher 
[02:24:30]  so here's some  quick clips from  the speech  let's hear how  well things are  going  the very important  speech from our  leader  our strategy is  clear in Iraq  we're hunting down  high value targets  like Azam and  Zarqawi  we're coordinating  aggressive counterterrorism  operations in the  areas where the  terrorists are  concentrated  we're constantly  adapting our  tactics  to the changing 
[02:25:00]  tactics of the  terrorists  we're training  more Iraqi  forces to  assume increasing  responsibility for  their country's  security  this is the  president of the  United States  he just said  nothing  that is a  speech I  swear to you  from a year  ago  you could play  that speech  same thing  from a year  ago  they all  kind of  have always  said nothing  but he  is the worst  at saying  nothing  he gets  like that  one word  we're making  what do you  say we're  making adjustments  to their  adjustments 
[02:25:30]  what  it was actually  another word  but he always  at least the  other presidents  also they said  nothing about  different subjects  like here's the  economy or this  he just says  nothing about  the war  we're adjusting  our tactics  to adjust  to their  tactics  and don't  get me wrong  you motherfuckers  don't get me  wrong  there is  it would be  tragic to pull  everybody out of  there right now  because then it  would just be a  clusterfuck mess  we got in there  now the job does 
[02:26:00]  have to be finished  whatever the  fucking job is  but the way it's  being handled by  this idiot  is wrong  wrong  I don't have the  answer but I  know what wrong  is  nuke it  motherfucker  just make a  parking lot  those guys are  the simple  solutions to  everything  drop a bomb  and all of  them  just nuke  them  into the  stone age  that's what  I do  make it into  a big parking  lot and then  what  why would you  park there  then you got  parking 
[02:26:30]  because  why  I love it  those guys  they always  follow  so bullshit  see I think  it's  I think it's  our job  and the job  of our listeners  to finally start  challenging people  when they come up  with this dopey  stuff  just go in  and kill  everyone  that's another  great one  just kill  them all  there's a little  kid there  fucking starving  eating a lollipop  boom right in  the head  kill them all  every fucking 
[02:27:00]  one of them  that's what I  say  but the parking  lot scenario  is just  just ask  them  how to handle  it  get us  soldiers out  let the  fucking  planes  do it  just lay  fucking  waste  really  just bomb  them all  right  yeah  fucking  craters  fucking  crater  the whole  thing  do that  what they  called  fucking  saturation  bombing  or something  they get  something they  heard on  discovery  wings  do like 
[02:27:30]  the cluster  bombs  or something  dude  just fucking  line them  up  and just  shoot them  right in  the fucking  I'll fucking  do it  give me a gun  right now  isn't that right  hey man  back to back  so you don't  waste bullets  one through  the head  kills two  people  and they  talk shit  like they  ramble  they wouldn't  want me  over there  I just  dude I'd  fucking go  off  send me  and my  buddies  over there  motherfucker  that shit  should be  over in a  week 
[02:28:00]  up top  motherfucker  another thing  I used to  do  like I  learned  at an  eagles  game  that any  story  that ends  with a  high five  never  happened  it's  always like  some  ridiculous  exaggeration  like  yeah  and then  I told  my boss  to go  fuck  himself  man  fucking  Jerry  on top  yeah  it's like  no you  didn't  you just  sat there  and you  stared at  the floor  and you  took it  and you  took it  like we  all  take it  fuck  and 
[02:28:30]  sister  on top  motherfucker  this is what I'm  talking about  this is turning  into an SNL  skit  and then the  real story  is he sat  there and he  took it  and then he  drove home  and he  screamed at  his windshield  saying all  the shit  he really  wanted to  say to  his boss  oh I'm  irresponsible  I'm  you're  looking at  some guy  but he  sucked it  up  I'm sorry  no next  time sir  I'm sorry  I'll do it  you know  I did  drop the ball  you ever talk to  someone and they're in that  situation and they impress you with the stuff they said to this person that they're in a conflict with

[02:31:00]  and so fucking good  and so just so fucking wonderful  how do you truly know  because we just do  we just know right  it's just in our dna i guess  i like when you go to like those caribbean islands right  like i went to the uh  oh i've been to some of those little countries  yeah  or anything  i went to the dominican republic  and you land there  and it's like absolutely beautiful  and there's like  there's no upper class  and there's no  there's just upper  and just like  upper class  dirt poor  there's no middle class  and you're always staying on like that resort  and they  they fucking  pick you up to the airport 
[02:31:30]  and they try to drive like  a hundred miles an hour  past all this poverty  you're looking  you're looking at this side  and there's like people chasing chickens and shit  as you're fucking driving down the road  just trying to get you in the compound  and then they slow it down  now the question i got  do you ever feel guilty though  you're seeing all this  this disaster around you  from the airport to the resort  and then you pull up to the resort  and what's waiting for you  a nice umbrella drink  gambling  gambling  you're just  you're taking a year's worth of their  a year's worth  ten years worth of their salary 
[02:32:00]  and putting it on red  oh yeah  whoever hands you  hey flip it a coin  just cause you can  whoever hands you that drink  that was their cousin  chasing the fucking rooster  he lives in the hut with him  yeah he gets to see  how the other side lives  for you know  eight hours  you gotta rationalize it  on your way though  you're looking out the window  thinking  I warned my vacation buster  I worked hard this year  nah I can't  I can't deal with this  it's horrendous  let's go to Brooklyn  Jim  he has a line he's heard a lot  Brooklyn  go ahead Jim  the one that sucks  that I've heard the most  is Afghanistan Disney 
[02:32:30]  with the Iraqi parking lot  it's like you  effing morons  Afghanistan Disney  with the Iraqi parking lot  of course  of course you couldn't  go to Afghanistan Disney  for like what  what is it  half life on a nuclear bomb  alright  go brooks  see you later guys  alright  very good  you would say  the radiation  from leveling it  would be a little  hard to take  while you're on  it's a small world  becoming irradiated  let's go back  which is a good  viable option  to that fucking ride  yeah but in the world  of darts 
[02:33:00]  all those  all those scenarios  get applause breaks  of course  Afghan Disney  yeah  fuck them  that's your foreign policy  fuck them  fuck them  kill them all  alright  President Bush's  war on terror update  we got any more clips  from our clip  commander  they updated me on  what recently took place  in Baghdad  in which  Iraqi coalition forces  tracked down and killed 
[02:33:30]  Abu Azam  the second most wanted  Al Qaeda leader  in Iraq  this guy's a brutal killer  oh I love when he does that  I love the look  I love the look  he gets  this guy's a brutal killer  saying the obvious  like that email  we read  yeah  I kind of like  that little charge out of that  if you're watching  like wrestling or something  this guy's a brutal killer  and I'm after you  coming to get you  he  and you know 
[02:34:00]  the words  the wording  of all these things  you know  you bomb  the subway  in London  they're terrorists  you bomb  World Trade Center  terrorists  the animals  over there  that are killing people  I don't put them  in the terrorist category  really don't  I'm sorry  I know a lot of people  are going to be all pissed off  at that  they're fighting  they're like  the enemy  they are the enemy 
[02:34:30]  whether you love  what they're doing  or think they're scumbags  they are the enemy  they are using  whatever they have  they can't go to an armory  and pick up some  fucking mortars  and set up a line  and outflank  our forces  they have cars  and high explosives  and that's what they use  just because they're using  car bombs  doesn't mean  they're the same type  of terrorist  that pulls up  in front of a  fucking school  in a jersey  or something  and blows that up  they're killing 
[02:35:00]  soldiers  they're killing  a lot of innocent  people too  don't get me wrong  as far as that's  concerned  but it's not  they're not doing it  to terrorize  the general public  they're doing it  to kill people  that they see  as occupying  their country  that's fucked up  that's fucked up  now you're talking  like a fucking  raghead  that's what they're doing  they're fighting  our soldiers  our soldiers  dying  they're soldiers 
[02:35:30]  why can't you  make the speeches  for Bush on TV  no because  believe me  people get pissed  when they hear  you're going to hear  people now chime in  that are really pissed  off at what I'm saying  because they go  oh what are they  fucking heroes  no  they're worthless  pieces of shit  that I don't agree  with their policy  of lopping people's  heads off either  believe me  but they're using  cars and bombs  like we use  helicopters and  tanks  it's their weapons  they're doing  but Bush  when you call  them terrorists 
[02:36:00]  it makes it sound  like they're the  same guys that  you know  are flying their  planes into  our buildings  they're blowing  up schools  whatever it is  he can't call  them soldiers  the enemy  things like that  you gotta keep  knocking into  the public's head  that they're  terrorists  and if we don't  kill them there  they're fucking  coming here  look out  they weren't  coming here  Saddam was so  fucking good  about keeping  his country  clean  he was the  muckety-muck  he was the  iron fist 
[02:36:30]  anyone fucked  with him  they died  they died  you think Saddam's  letting these  idiots set up  camp in his  country  no  that country  was fine  the UN  kept him  from doing  anything  he was under  a microscope  there weren't  weapons of  mass destruction  stop trying to  tell me there  were by sending  me links to  these Aussie  fucking  the equivalent  of the Australian  National Enquirer  saying how they  found biological  weapons  if they found 
[02:37:00]  a weapon of  mass destruction  Bush would be  sitting on it  driving down  Pennsylvania Avenue  waving to the  fucking press  it just didn't  happen  that was the  bill of goods  we were sold  on the war  that's why I  was behind the  war  when it first  kicked off  I was one of  those  kill him  motherfucker  up top  yeah  look at what  fucking Colin  Powell's pointing out  at the UN  mobile labs  motherfucker  they got him  there's a picture  and then as time  went on 
[02:37:30]  I'm like  holy shit  this was a bunch  of crap  and he's changing  the whole subject  of why we're there  gotta free the  Iraqi people  wait  but that's not  why you said  we were going  to war  and they don't  really seem to  want to be free  they were fine  under this guy  what about the  weapons  we're free  they yearned  for freedom  they yearned  for constitution  democracy  it wasn't  what I was  sold  and now  we're there  to free 
[02:38:00]  Iraq  nothing about  what we were  there originally  for  nothing about  what the  fucking UN  sanctions were  about when  this whole  thing started  but  I thought  I started  off with  going to get  Osama  that's the  guy I wanted  right  that was the  original thing  as far as  terrorism's  concerned  that was the  deal  Afghanistan  and Osama  bin Laden  he was the  guy to get  he's the  guy  got on  video  yes  it was  me  I crashed  the  fucking  planes  I planned  the whole  thing  I think he  even added  in a  on the tape 
[02:38:30]  it was all  what happened  to him  what about  the troops  after him  why are we  in Iraq  why are we  there  no terrorists  over there  there was  fucking  Saddam Hussein  ruling like  a fucking  tyrant  rules  well  you got  everyone  oh they're  pissed off  you got  everyone rocking  here we go  Jared Jersey  what's up  I just want  to comment  you seem to  think that  it's the  Iraqis  fighting the  US soldiers  it's not  the Iraqis  yes  how is it 
[02:39:00]  the Iraqis  it's a bunch  of people  from a bunch  of terrorist  countries  right  that back  terrorism  but what are  they doing  they're coming  in and trying  to kill  our soldiers  right but  it's not  Iraqis  the Iraqis  themselves  want to be  free  oh yeah  show me  that one  show me  that one  show me  their yearning  for freedom  that they  went through  that they  were crying  to have us  come over  there  they had a  higher voter  turnout  than we did  wasn't the  bill of goods  we were sold  my friend 
[02:39:30]  when we went  to war  was it  to free  the Iraqi  people  no it  wasn't  right and  they weren't  there  and now  and they  changed  the whole  subject  of the  war  to free  the Iraqi  people  I don't  care if  they're  free  most Americans  could give  a flying fuck  if the Iraqi  people were  free  the Iraqi  people could  have cared  less  if they wanted  to be free  they should  have rose  up and  fought their  leader  Tony in 
[02:40:00]  St. Louis  yeah I don't  agree with  Professor Anthony  either  I'm not trying  to be a  shithead or  anything but  I just don't  believe that  you're saying  that the Iraqi  people don't  want to be  free  they're in  there voting  and you're  saying that  these terrorists  or whatever  the hell you  want to call  them insurgents  freedom fighters  you know they're  saying that  they're just  there to  blow up  the American  troops  and defeat  us  but they're  in there  going through  mosques  they're blowing  up schools  half these  explosions 
[02:40:30]  don't even  have Americans  involved in  it  so what do  you derive  from that  I derive  that okay  I might have  thrown a wide  blanket over the  whole thing  sure there  are what you  would call a  few troublemakers  over there  but the fact of  the matter is a  lot of our  soldiers are  dying by these  roadside bombs  they got to go  out on these  patrols and get  shot at by people  who are those  people terrorists  die in every war  we're fucked no  matter how we do  this  the bottom line  is we have to  maintain what we  have now  like you said  we can't leave 
[02:41:00]  and sure you're  right the whole  thing's fucked  it's a kill  botch  the whole thing  it was squashed  from the beginning  when they went in  from weapons of  mass destruction  and then ended up  you know changing  the whole frontier  I mean you're  right but you're  wrong I mean  that's that's  where I stand  all right  fair enough  all right  well it's fair  enough to say a lot  of people disagree  with anthony  of course they do  let's go to another  clip from president  bush's war on terror  let's hear it  he's got a killer  speech  the terrorists have  a history of  escalating their  attacks before  iraq's major 
[02:41:30]  political milestones  two key elections  are fast approaching  as these milestones  approach we can  expect there to be  increasing violence  from the terrorists  they can't stand  elections  the thought of  people voting  is an anathema  to them  so what  is a what  an anathema  it's an anathema  to them  they don't like  the elections  elections mean  freedom 
[02:42:00]  one more clip  coalition iraqi  troops are on  the hunt for  terrorists in  western iraq  we're on the  offense  we have a plan  to win  we're working  to stop those  terrorists from  crossing into the  country through  syria  we're denying  safe haven to  al-qaeda in the  anbar province  so is the  game plan  let me get this 
[02:42:30]  right  is the game  plan then  to wait until  the terrorists  all come in  from all these  different countries  to a central  location  which is iraq  and then kill  them all  and when all  of it when the  last one crosses  over and goes  and you shoot  them and then we  look around and  there's no more  terrorists it's a  war of attrition  is that what it  is then we can  leave or is it  when the terrorists  finally go  america's great  what have we been  doing let's stop 
[02:43:00]  killing and and be  cool where what's  the end game  what's the the  plan for victory  exit strategy  the exit strategy  i've heard it  before believe me  i've heard it  it's to train the  iraqis so they  can take care of  themselves blah blah  blah do you see  that happening  wow in any  foreseeable future  no you know  what the problem  is whenever you  occupy a country  or something like  that or you  take it over is  they know eventually  you're gonna  fucking leave  so they just 
[02:43:30]  gotta like wait  you out  just wait it  out  yeah  so the only way  to really do it  is to fucking  kill them all  that's the only  way that i think  i don't know  it's really  difficult  just get fucking  sat down  sat down i mean  osama  osama  get him  yeah  still talking  shit  i'm still  that's the guy  get that guy  you gotta get  i'm sorry  because yeah  he's the guy  he said i did  that shit  there should have  been a hell of a  lot more resources  in afghanistan  going after that  motherfucker and  his little pals 
[02:44:00]  yeah but as far as  like saying like  those guys aren't  like terrorists and  stuff i mean i  think they i mean  if you're going out  you're just trying to  blow up soldiers  those guys like  walk into like a  like a pizza cafe  and they're blowing  up kids and shit  it's like you  know is that  really to terrorize  i mean it's  terrorizing or is  it to get our  soldiers the fuck  out well i guess  they they're they're  attacking people who  are supporting what  we're doing over  right then they then  consider them uh  here's what i  and i don't know  you know it's  war it's fucking 
[02:44:30]  evil but they're  right there's still  lines okay look  you know i'm willing  to say i'm willing  to say perhaps my  use of uh the word  terrorism or lack  thereof is wrong  okay uh now that  i'm thinking about  it but the but the  the bottom line is  would this shit be  going on would the  terrorism be going  on if we weren't  there would these  schools in iraq be  being blown up by  these terrorists if  we weren't there are  you um becoming a  liberal no i'm the  furthest thing for 
[02:45:00]  believe me i'm the  furthest everyone on  instant feedback is  just going what  happened i am the  furthest thing from a  fucking liberal i am a  realist assholes a  lot of people say  anthony equals  liberal no which  is really funny is  so oh to read  because uh anthony  is pretty hardcore  the other way i love  what i that first  gulf war i i jerked  off to it i loved it  it was fantastic saddam  went into kuwait the  mission was to get  saddam out of kuwait  even when they were

[02:49:00]  there is no fucking you  there is only me  oh yeah  people calling me Anthony Combs  from Hannity and Combs  I'm a big lib  he just questioned  whether America is the greatest country  I never questioned  whether America is the greatest country  I did as a goof  I absolutely know it is  it's uh  but how do you know  because I watch enough films  of other countries 
[02:49:30]  and they stink  we're not a lot of  dirty people that barely ever shower  we're not allowed to smoke pot  openly like you can  in that other country there  which was that  Amsterdam  Amsterdam  is that part of a country  or is that a town  that's the city  it's crazy  I think America is great  and then the second  you bash Bush  I'm a lib  I could read  50 instant feedbacks  that are coming in  and a lot of people  using the capital letters  on this thing  that means they're yelling  I'm a lib  it's about time  people dislike you 
[02:50:00]  usually Anthony can do  no wrong in this fucking show  it gets really frustrating  I've been called  a Bush zombie  conservative asshole  and the biggest liberal  motherfucker  commie  like it's  no that's how it works  nowadays  it's like if  whatever one point  you're talking about  that someone is discussing  if they're a republican  you disagree  oh you're fucking liberal  or you know  like vice versa  you can't be like  hey I kind of take it  as it goes  here's my lib thought  in closing  in conclusion  my big lib thought 
[02:50:30]  to the end of your lib rant  yeah  you know what I want  I want more troops  over there in Iraq  I want more  and I'm not joking  I want more troops  more hardware over there  I would love a soldier  on every square foot  of that shithole  so that when  some guy comes in  with a vest on  with explosives  they could shoot him  you know why  they would end this shit  a lot faster  they're  once you notice  that we're in  a little bit of  trouble over there  as far as 
[02:51:00]  the body count  going up  and it really  looking like  there's no real light  at the end of the tunnel  here as far as  getting these terrorists  go  more troops  send them over there  get the job done quicker  please  that's it  oh that's the real  liberal thought  isn't it  to send more  fucking people over there  let's talk to a guy  that was over there  for a year  Todd  right  Jesus  hey what's going on guys  hey  what's up  hey  those people  do not want us there  at all  I spent a year  in Afghanistan  a year in Iraq 
[02:51:30]  they don't fucking  want us there  no  and why do you say that  because they treat  they treat us like  shit over there  they have no respect  for what we're trying  to do for them  I mean I help build  schools and churches  open up their  shithole mosques for them  and you know  try to get back  in their feet  they have no  no fucking respect  for what we try  to do for them  you have to understand  and maybe even have  a taste of freedom  before you can want it  those people  hadn't a clue  what freedom  or democracy  was about 
[02:52:00]  people talk about  I love when they try  to make it sound like  they're like we were  back when we were  trying to form  our country  and break away  from England  it's so different  we wanted freedom  the Americans  back then  were trying  to fight  oppression  themselves  and they got  backing from other  countries like France  and stuff  we wanted the freedom  we were fighting  for it already  not like these people  where we come in  and go no  believe me 
[02:52:30]  you're going to love  this freedom stuff  and the only reason  we're giving it to you  is because the weapon  the mass destruction  thing fell down  but you're going to  want the freedom  we're going to give you  they live so long  without  under iron fist  and doing things  his way  that now that we  try to give him  something better  they were like  a battered  you know  a battered woman  she keeps  coming back  to the relationship  because she doesn't  know better  going back  you just know  what you know  you know  what you know  the guy ruled 
[02:53:00]  with an iron fist  and that's what  the people understood  that's what they knew  they don't know  about freedom  they don't know  they don't  they don't know  how to work it  they don't know  how to survive  in a free society  they don't understand  how good it is  you can't force  and meanwhile  now  what they know  about freedom  and democracy  is people being  blown up  that seems to be  the number one  thing democracy  is bringing them  are there any  countries out there  with brutal dictators  that actually 
[02:53:30]  have terrorism  wow  it's probably  the hardest place  to terrorize  is somewhere  where you have  a brutal dictator  they're doing  all the terrorizing  of their people  they want  exclusive rights  to terrorize  their fucking people  they are the  walmart  I do that shit  I do it  you don't come in here  they are the  walmart of terrorism  right  you don't blow them up  I was going to  torture them  you get a bully  in the schoolyard  right  you don't get a bully  from another school  that comes over  and beats up  your people

[02:59:30]  and now I'm  right wing  I think they'll  cover this week  alright we're gonna  see what happens  what we got  four games left  they're taking on  ball state  the team that  has 13 of their  players arrested  for like  on campus  assault  and burglary  and battery  they haven't  scored a touchdown  in three weeks  you know you can't  defend that  who threw out  the first ball  at Fenway  last night  a wookie  a wookie  they had  Chewbacca  that was a little  rough bill  you gotta admit  throwing out the first pitch 
[03:00:00]  we have no pitching  we are in trouble  we just kept him  on the mound  why would you eat  Tums if you had a headache  this guy  he's just going  listen  listen Bill  hold on  hold on  Pharrell  hold on  hold on  I wanna  I wanna see Bill  defend that  Chewbacca threw out  the first pitch  at the Red Sox  game last night 
[03:00:30]  I can't  it's fucking horrendous  and what does it say  what does the headline say  it's awful  it says  now  hair this  uh-huh  hold on  hold on  yeah but you know  what  nothing's worse  than that ball  dude with the big ears  that sings  God bless America  who only does  that verse  that no one  gives a fuck about  over like  20 minutes before  it's like  dude  get to the hook  you're singing  a hit  how about Wrigley  it's so depressing  they got Jeff Gordon  calls it Wrigley Stadium  and they got  everybody every night 
[03:01:00]  I don't know  who's next  they're gonna let me  sing the anthem  correctly to the  7th inning stretch  in Wrigley now  and they'll have  anyone on  I mean it doesn't matter  you could have  murdered somebody  and they'll let you  sing in the 7th  in Chicago  alright here we go  so uh  Chewbacca throws out  the first pitch  and the headline is  now hair this  no that's not  Johnny Damon  oh I get it  cause uh  the hair  dude you know  what would have  happened to that  dude if they  ever tried to do  that in Philly  oh my god  Philadelphia is the  greatest  the greatest sports 
[03:01:30]  I'm starting to think  they're fans  they make  Boston fans  look  they're  civilized  yeah they threw  snowballs at  Santa Claus  anytime they try to  do some sort of  musical interlude  during halftime  you get fucking  booed  you see when they  booed Destiny's Child  at the fucking  NBA finals  they were singing  like bootylicious  and the sixes  are down 12 points  and the whole crowd  is like what the  fuck is this  and they're like  da da da da bootylicious  and they're like  and everybody's like  boo  it was awesome 
[03:02:00]  fucking awesome  they would rape  the Virgin Mary  yeah they're brutal  they had a prison  at the old  stadium that the  Eagles used to play  in the vet  they used to have  the person underneath  the stadium  you go to the game  if you're too hammered  like Pharrell at a game  they throw you in  you spend the night  underneath a stadium  in a holding cell  what could be worse  holy shit  you're losing your voice  buddy  I never lose my voice  so what happened  on Adam Carolla  the other night  we haven't gotten  to the bottom  of that story yet  I have no idea 
[03:02:30]  oh wait  this isn't Steve-o  it's Scott  I haven't seen that  in five years  six years  since I lived out there  dude  here's the deal  what do you think  what do you think  of the Jets  how do you like that  for breakfast  what do you think  of the Jets  I think the Jets  blow but they hired  Vinny  the fact of the matter  is Bowlinger's  dead meat in Baltimore  this week  I can't see him  doing anything  he's never thrown  a pass in a regular  season game  even Vinny can't  get the book down  that quick 
[03:03:00]  they're going to have  their problems  against the Ravens  defense there for sure  in Baltimore  and betters  they're all over  in Vegas  they're running  to the window  I swear to god  they'll even date  fat chicks  and they're taking  the over 31  a lot of people  think that just  because Bowlinger's  in they're not  going to score at all  I still think  the Ravens  are going to score  31  that makes me want  I want to bet  I want to bet  on that Jets game  what is the line  on that one  the easiest game  last week  was the Charger  game with Eli  going in there  Eli was tough  under pressure  to show that  when he went out 
[03:03:30]  to Southern  California  where they  hate him  because he  blew off  playing there  but he played  clutch  the rest of the  Giants  didn't get it  done  but the Chargers  were a great  hit  coming out  of the gates  last week  playing at home  what's the line  on the Jets game  the line  on the Jets game  this week  is I think  it's six and a half  well the spread  is seven  now it's moved  the Jets are  getting seven  everybody's jumping  on Baltimore  because the kid  Bowlinger's going  to play  he came in  honestly  his legs  are as weak  as mine  they called him  up  he was taking  his kids  to breakfast 
[03:04:00]  to school  he was in the SUV  when they called  him  so true  the best he could  say during the  press conferences  is that he's  been throwing  the ball  twice a week  and Bill  brought up  a great point  it was probably  a Nerf ball  in the backyard  with his son  he got a million  bucks to play  and I'll bet this  he's playing  horseshoes  all the old ladies  love Vinny  in New York  they love him  he could throw  five interceptions  they'd still have  him over for dinner  any other games 
[03:04:30]  you like this week  yeah there's a bunch  of them  you know I finally  think the Saints  are going to cover  at home  they're going to  win their first game  they're playing  where's home  though for them  now  Buffalo sucks  at home  and on the road  forget about them  I like Jacksonville  at home  they play great  defense  I like the under  in that game  against Denver  Jake Plummer  looks like he does  like mushrooms  and smoke  pine buds  but with that  beard  in his throat  take a shave  you look like  shit  Tampa Bay  at home  that's going to be  wild  Buck and Harrison  they can  hand be  and that'll be  crazy  I really like  Shade 
[03:05:00]  take a fucking  shave  they'll win  in Nashville  I like  Philly to do  well  and Kansas City  I'll take  New England  at home  again  they just don't  lose  they beat  the Steelers  they're going to  beat San Diego  Seattle  yeah  respect  I'm going  skins at home  the dynasty  it's going to be  a great game  I like the under  36 and a half  in that one  I like the Rams  and the number  in big blue country  against the Giants  G-Men and the  Meadowlands  over the 46  that thing will be  a crazy game  go over to 46 
[03:05:30]  you let them go  and he's going to  start talking about  ping pong  I like Duke  Kim  versus Chang Long  Wong  this battle's  been on fuego  his voice is so  loud in his head  yeah  alright Scott  wow  very impressive  obviously  but I got to  ask you the  question  are you up or  down with your  gambling  dude I'm up  heavy

[03:15:30]  right  he's pretty much saying  I'm an asshole  24 hours a day  even Martin is agreeing  wow  I'm not saying you're an asshole  not at least  what time do you get in  in the morning  can this possibly be an exaggeration  of my personality  I asked you that question today  it is  he's nicer than a lot of people  think he is  you get paid a lot  this is going to be like  okay  why are you still wearing  your sick glasses by the way  because my  I love people that have to wear  the sick glasses 
[03:16:00]  sick glasses  yeah  what the hell is that  are you wearing sick glasses  yeah  what are sick glasses  never heard of that  you have  you gotta start getting out  of your house more  people get sick  and they do weird things  they start wearing  their sick glasses  but I don't understand  because they're so sick  they can't deal with  the contact thing  and stuff like that  so they have like  a pair of glasses  that they wear  when they're sick  I've never worn glasses  I don't know that  did you ever have  sick glasses  yeah  before I got the  laser eye surgery  yeah  sure  how scary was that  it was really scary 
[03:16:30]  really scary  really scary  like a 1% chance  that you're  gonna be standing  in front of the  port authority  with a tin cup  to this day  people ask about it  and the only advice  I would give  is to go to a guy  that's been doing it  a really long time  the surgery got so popular  that a lot of guys  are doing it out there  that maybe shouldn't  be doing it  and that's where  the risks get  cutting the prices  down real low  yeah  that's where I think  that is truly scary  can you operate  on my eye 
[03:17:00]  oh yeah  I can do that  dude  everyone's an opportunist  out there  you know  this thing exploded  everyone's getting  the laser eye surgery  so you had a bunch  of experts  that were doing it  and there were  a bunch of other  people  fringe players  like fuck that  I heard like  you can go down  to Florida  or one of these  places  and just take  a quick course  and a week  or two weeks  later  you're actually  performing the  damn surgery  if you got  the equipment  you buy the  equipment on loan  you know  discount eye surgery  yeah  it's your eyes  man  if you go to  a reputable  this guy will do  it for 80 bucks  go to a reputable  you know  organization  you'll be fine 
[03:17:30]  I mean  the guy advertised  on our show  and I turned  thousands of people  onto it  not one email  came in saying  dude  I trusted you  and I'm fucked up now  you think  couldn't see  those are those  emails you got  that were just like  P-X-Y-Q  yeah  trying to thought  it was program text  trying really hard  to remember  where the letter  R was  somewhere over here  I was like  why do I keep  getting this  gibberish email 
[03:18:00]  that's hilarious  just move your  fingers over  like  like  just one  one key  inside  fuck you  opie  and you'll decode it  it'll be the exact same  you made me blind  motherfucker  anyway  he's got his sick  glasses  cause you got what  strep throat  no  no strep throat  oh thank goodness  ruled no strep throat  what do you got  just um  just a regular  sore throat  sore throat  congestion  tonsillitis  congested  very  very sickly  nope  should be gone  in a couple days  did they give you  any prescriptions  Vicodin  what did they give you 
[03:18:30]  uh  Tylenol  codeine  what do you do  with your 100 grand  pussy drugs  that was actually  that was one of the  things  there's nothing wrong  with Ikea  it's good furniture  Ikea furniture  he's buying  with his 100 grand  and then  I was actually  going to do  the article board  the eye surgery  oh were you  going to get  the eye surgery  yeah  wow  nice  I was told  not to do it  in Florida  I said to do it  in New York  so  how much  does that run  not sure yet  you have to get 
[03:19:00]  consultations  before you can even  speak to the doctor  who's going to do the surgery  how many fingers  you got to make sure  your pupils  don't dilate too much  what  is that what they got to do  well because the machine  I know all this crap  the slip  the flap  well the machine  the older machines  weren't like  capable of  doing the whole surface  if you had  your pupils  getting really wide  yeah  you know what I mean  yeah  and that's where  you would have  the problem  because you would  have your old pupils  basically on the edge 
[03:19:30]  and then the brand new  you know  shaved down  or whatever they do  right  oh yeah  and that's why  you would get  the stars and stuff  oh they get that  starlight  kind of a  like it's got a  so my brother  you ever put a lens  on a camera  that makes every  little light  look like starlight  like kind of a filter  so my brother  you ever see it  on your TV  or movie career  where they  I think I have an album  cover of Leif Garrett  they use that  okay  that's exactly  my brother  for example  his pupils  were too big  so my guy 
[03:20:00]  my guy  who wanted to  hook up my brother  said no way  your pupils  are too big  and there are  guys out there  that will  attempt it on you  do not do it  but then he said  there was a new  machine coming out  that would take  care of his  problem as well  they seem to keep  having these new  procedures  what about the  bladeless one  he ended up  getting it done  and he's fine  what about the one  where you don't  need the flap  anymore  I hear there's  like a bladeless  one  oh really  because that seems  to be the one  that really makes  people that move  they gotta slit  the front of your eye  like a deli slicer  like a deli slicer 
[03:20:30]  but a little of the  top is still attached  to something  and then flip up  what they just slit  and then zap zap zap  zap zap  and then zap it  with the laser  in there  yeah  and then flip the flap  back down  maybe  it's been a while  maybe 30 seconds  per eye  I'm thinking  and you go blind  and you're awake  during this whole thing  yeah they hook you up  with some nice value  when they flip your  when they slit  and flip  you go blind  in that eye  your eyes open  and you can't see  because you need that  to see 
[03:21:00]  all of a sudden  you see them perfectly  and they lift the  yeah the flap up  and all of a sudden  you see just  really big  distorted  like I don't know  oh my god  shapes  really distorted  and then they flap  the thing back down  also the doctor's like  just a big  like square  oh yeah  it's creepy  my grandmother's 97  and she got it  like 4 years ago  when she was like  she still drives  get out of here  wow  still drives  nice  holy jeez 
[03:21:30]  alright Iraq  so tomorrow  we will  announce the  winner of the  assault on the  media contest  for September  and then we start  the contest  right up  for October  right  yeah  and the prizes  hopefully will get  even bigger  for October  we'll have  the list of prizes  for the October  contest soon  and there he goes  he kind of delays  a little  and kind of  walks toward the  door  and then stops  like he's hoping  to get close  to the door  before his music  kicks in  yeah  but Derek  is such a prick  he just will not 
[03:22:00]  let him get away  with it  he needs to just  embrace it at this  point  of course  he should do  a little dance  to it  it would diffuse  the whole thing  and ruin it  if he came in  and started  like break dancing  to it  guys  paradise  paradise  is the greatest  show on TV  paradise  if we had a TV  pitch like this  we would be on  A&E at this point  how would the pitch  go  drunk whore  we got this  drunk whore  think drunk whore  around the world  yeah  we need drunk whore

[03:23:00]  this is the last  hurrah for her  yeah  this is how it ends  for Tara Reid  by the way  Tara Dice is like  the citizen king  of trashy late night  basic cable party shows  an e-tour of the  horrible fabulous life  of Tara Reid  who's citizen Kane  the star of body shots  sloshes around the world  boozing it up in  Monte Carlo  stumbling on yachts  in St. Troy  slurring I need to get  some ass  or I think Sardinia 
[03:23:30]  is Tara Dice  Tara Dice  Tara Dice is full of  precious moments with  Tara as a goodwill  ambassador spreading  her loving arms  around the globe  when somebody mentions  the London terrorist  bombings  Tara steps right up  and this is what  she had to say  about that  if all the mean  people want to be  mean to each other  buy a country together  and just blow each  other up  then there'd be  no terrorists left  but like 
[03:24:00]  don't kill innocent  people for no reason  it's not fair  it makes me sad  can you imagine  trying to like  maintain an erection  as she's talking  like you got her  back to her apartment  babbling  I'm going to bang  this girl  and she's like  yeah you should do  about terrorism  it's awful  have to buy an island  all together  and they can all  get on it  what we're going to  do is get Al-Qaeda  on one island  it's what we're going  to do is get them  all together  and they'll blow  each other up  is what they're going  to do  I believe I heard 
[03:24:30]  one of my advisors  said this  was it one of my  advisors  we're going to  get them  we're going to put  them on an island  and blow it  and then all the  evil will be gone  in the world  where did I hear that  it was either  advisor or  terror dice  when was it  I can't recall  we've got to  make sure  she commits  herself against  terrorism  I'm calling her  a terrorist  it's so awful  to watch  well this is  one of our 
[03:25:00]  favorite things  it's one of our  favorite new things  playing terror clips  because she is just  a drunk whore  we've got a couple  things here  she was in  Croatia  what  Croatia  oh my god  paradise made it  to Croatia  you guys  you guys  there's these  Brazilian dancers  and belly dancers  and people were  doing these like  bongo things  and all of a sudden  you know we're  dancing and having  a great time

[03:26:30]  it was about an hour and a half  boat ride  to get to where we had to get to  on the way there  they did my hair  and then we did my makeup  and we picked out  what clothes we were doing  so the time we got there  everything was ready  set up  and I was a little nervous  I was in all bikinis  I was like oh god  I look okay  but I saw the pictures  and I think it's going to come out pretty good  this is why they're sending her  around the world  this is why  she is on an aircraft  going to different places  in the world  so she can get on a boat 
[03:27:00]  and have her makeup done  and tell everybody about it  and I've been waiting years  for TV to get to this point  train wreck TV  you're just going to see  more and more of this crap now  you know they've said  about reality programming  that there's no  like redeeming value  quality to any of these shows  this truly  offers  nothing  this show offers  abso-fucking-lutely  nothing  to the viewer  they even edited it  to  just making fun of  how fucking awful she is

[03:33:00]  you hear that  where were they  yeah they were probably  somewhere where there  wasn't crocodiles  they had a crossover  a moat  because they're moat  the crocodile  like she's getting her  information from  fucking cartoons  did he dress like that  guy from Burger King  fucking retard  there's a moat  and you gotta get across it  on a little raft  with a sail  and you take a fan up  and you plug the fan in  and blow it on the sail  and you go across the moat  and then you get a big barrel 
[03:33:30]  of TNT  and put it by the gate  and then you go back  and light it  but the rabbit already lit it  while you were rocking backwards  and then it blows you up  and then you gotta go  all the way back to the ship  and get another match  and you try to light  the big pot  with the rabbit in it  but the rabbit blows it out  and you gotta go back  and even a kid knows  why didn't he bring more  than just one match  because he keeps going back  for the match  what do you do  when the dragon shows up  the car starts  breathing fire  and you're like  whoa  you know  you raise like  you go  raise the droppers  raise the droppers 
[03:34:00]  and like the dragon's coming  and you raise the droppers  and we were dancing on the tables  and then you get over  your fear of death  because it's like  you know  but a dragon doesn't exist  I was like wow  and I went into the powder room  and I thought it was gunpowder  but all of a sudden  it turned into like  there were mirrors  and powder in there  I like sucking the cock  of a fat guy  because I don't like  a washboard meal  it makes me feel better  about myself  this is just endless  so we were eating

[03:36:00]  that sounds like  one of those publicity things  that's just dumb  diva shit  that means nothing  alright here we go  Tara described  she's described as  the female  Joe Cocker  oh no  what  get a Joe Cocker song  ready Derek  why  so I sang back to him  but God only knows  what I sang  I don't even know  what I was doing  I'm really retarded  I hope they don't show that  I can't sing it  I can't sing it 
[03:36:30]  my voice is broken  no it's broken  like a  I told her  she sounded like a female  Joe Cocker  Joe Cocker  I'll get by with a little help from my friends.  I'm feeling all right.  Oh, my God, you guys.  I'm singing.  Where's my shoe? 
[03:37:00]  Every night, I just, I had the same dream over and over again.  In prison, by the way.  I could have been.  I love you.  I love you.  So it seems.  Get to the hook, guys.  There's too many words.  Why do songs have to be so wordy?  All right. 
[03:37:30]  But everyone around me feels like shit.  She does have a kind of a Joe Cocker tone to her voice.  You guys want more?  What would you do if I sang out of tune, you guys?  Yeah, we got any more?  Sure.  The Tara.  All right.  She's in Sardinia.  Where is that?  I have no idea. 
[03:38:00]  Is that where they put the little fish in the cans?  You got to open a key?  I hate Sardinia.  Where is it?  Off Italy.  Off Italy.  Thank you.  Italy.  I'm at the beach now.  Porto Polo.  So I think it means chicken beach.  And there's supposed to be like professional wind surfers and kite surfing.  And there's a million people behind me doing it.  And I want to meet these really cute boys.  Barney and Jason.  And they're going to show me.  Barney and Jason.  All right.  She sounds kind of normal there.  Yeah.  It's before she got hammered.  Yay. 
[03:38:30]  Good morning.  Look at my first kite.  That was really scary.  You almost killed someone.  You know that, right?  Look.  Look at them.  They're all running away.  Seriously?  Almost killed all of them.  Then they started yelling, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, whatever it was at the time.  But I know it wasn't nice.  Oh, my God.  There's no way I'm flying on that thing.  There's not even a chance.  No, not happening.  Not happening.  It's so crazy.  That's the thing.  I think Bill pointed this out.  Is that they show her all these cool activities, and then she refuses to do them. 
[03:39:00]  She doesn't do any of them.  She won't do any of them.  So now all they're left to do is we're just going to make fun of how fucking stupid you are.  Because that's all we have in the footage.  He makes a good point.  Because the next clip is Tara practicing windsurfing on beach.  Refuses to try it on water.  She doesn't do anything.  How could you...  The running of the bulls.  I'm going to be doing that.  I'll tell you a minute.  Oh, my God.  You guys are crazy.  And then they cut to her.  She's like, oh, my God.  There's like, no way I'm doing that.  And then you just cut to her in a bar, drunk.  And we were dancing.  I was dancing. 
[03:39:30]  People were running.  It was insanely crazy.  Like, I wasn't going to do it.  She doesn't do any of the things.  I'm much too drunk.  Yeah, she literally goes...  The whole purpose of going is to get involved in the activities.  To do these things.  Yeah.  China.  Great Wall of China.  I wasn't...  I'm not going up all the steps.  I don't want to.  I'm tired.  I'm going back to the hotel.  Well, here she is practicing windsurfing on the beach and not in the water.  I did windsurfing on the sand, and I still couldn't do it. 
[03:40:00]  I was like...  You know, like, wiggling, jiggling, like trying to just stand.  And all of a sudden, I was like...  You know, like, it was crazy.  It was so much fun, though.  Like, I fell in the sand like 20 times.  I decided that you're going to do it, and I'm going to watch you.  Oh, come on.  Oh, I'm going to watch you.  That's why we're doing it.  This is a joke, right?  No, it's true.  Can you imagine being that director when she tells the story, I can't do it, and I fell  out like 20 times.  It's crazy.  And then you've got to be like, and cut.  You think we got that?  When do you know when to yell cut? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, and you just say anything.  Do we got anything?  Can we use anything?  Anything?  I fell out like 20 times.  She was talking about being on the sand with the sailboard.  So all you have to do is stand, really.  It's called standing at that point.  You're not windsurfing.  You're standing on the beach.  I fell down like 20 times.  You guys.  We're running out of show.  Let's get a couple more clips in before we get out of here for the day.  So then me and Constantine, we go out to Billionaire, and we made such a scene walking  in there.  Everyone's, like, taking our pictures of paparazzi, this, that. 
[03:41:00]  Then they put us in this VIP room.  So before you know it, I'm sitting in Constantine's lap, and we're sitting in a chair like a throne.  We looked like retards.  But it was hysterical.  Like, I didn't even care.  I was just staring at him.  It was so hot.  No, you are retards.  And again, and cut.  Is there anything we can use there?  Visiting Roberto Cavalli's...  Who is that?  Some fashion guy.  Oh, some fashion guy.  His boat.  Oh, my God. 
[03:41:30]  You don't know which gallery.  Oh, my God.  It's a purple, blue, blue.  Look at pink, purple, red now.  Oh, my God.  It's gold.  It's gold.  It's gold, Dad.  Look at it.  Yellow, orange.  Wow.  Was she describing a bowl of tricks?  Wow, look at this.  It's blue.  It's orange.  It's turning the...  This one's turning the milk brown.  It's like Coco Puffs, but...  What is she talking about?  Wow, it's gold.  What was that? 
[03:42:00]  She was going on the boat, I guess.  But what was she...  The colors of the boat?  A ferris wheel?  What got her attention?  It's the boat is designed so that it looks different colors from different angles.  Oh, it's got one of those paint schemes that, like, prism-like paint.  Oh, boy.  Put her in a reality show.  Her, Tara Reade, and Stalker Patty.  It'll be like...  How do you pitch that?  It's like Cagney and Lacey meet the Jerry Lewis telethon.  Oh, look at it. 
[03:42:30]  It's changing colors.  What a dope.  That's what she got out of a boat ride.  I guess we'll end there.  It was the pretty colors.  Huh?  That's a good one?  Was there one more?  Well, we'll save it for the next time we go down this road.  Oh, I love the Tara Dice.  We'll visit with Tara and Tara Dice another time on the Opie and Anthony program, but we're  done for today, man.  Yeah.  What do we have to promote?  Nothing, right?  BillBurr.com.  Yes.  Sacramento next week. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  On MySpace.  Go to BillBurr.com for all sorts of info.  And I guess stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  That's what we could end with.  Ron and Fez, up next.  How much time?  We got four, three, two, one.  Four seconds left.  Zero.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  This is the B-Day Radio Show. </pre>
