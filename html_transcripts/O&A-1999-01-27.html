<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a recap of the previous day's broadcast, highlighting a segment with sex expert Laura Korn and a couple who demonstrated one of her techniques on-air, resulting in a reportedly incredible orgasm for the male partner.  The hosts teased revealing the technique later, promising to also explain a mysterious "blue balloon" incident from the previous day.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a feud with Carol Miller, a colleague whose show followed theirs.  Carol was described as disliking Opie, calling him a "meathead" and accusing the hosts of kleptomania, and complaining about their messy studio and lack of respect.  The hosts countered by detailing Carol's demanding preparation needs and perceived diva-like behavior.

The show then opened up to listener calls. Carrie excitedly recounted trying a technique from Laura Korn's book ("velvet tongue," involving herbal tea, honey, and oral sex), resulting in a highly satisfying experience for her partner.  A listener won a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers and a Super Bowl party at their house, where Opie and Anthony would bring a 53-inch Sony projection TV, a prospect that filled the hosts with some trepidation.  A lengthy discussion about video game addiction, particularly Anthony's obsession with Half-Life, ensued. A production staff member recounted his own addiction to the game, highlighting its intense focus and immersive nature. The segment included troubleshooting Anthony’s computer problems with listener advice.

The hosts finally revealed Laura Korn's "Stand Back" technique,  involving blindfolding the male partner with a necktie and using hot and cold liquids during oral sex for a stimulating temperature contrast. They used "snuffleupagus" as a euphemism for penis.  The show concluded with a humorous, and at times offensive, discussion about a coworker, "Ben the fag," focusing on his perceived questionable bar and dating choices. Ben defended himself, and the segment ended with more listener interaction, promotion of upcoming events, and a Stephen Lynch song.

The next segment started with a crude and sexually explicit Popeye impression, repeatedly using the neologism "pusky" in reference to Olive Oyl's anatomy and Popeye's sexual exploits.  This was followed by a Star Trek trivia contest featuring William Shatner as a guest.  Listeners called in to answer trivia questions, with the first caller to stump Shatner winning a prize.  Shatner’s responses ranged from correct answers to humorous reactions to incorrect or movie-related answers.  During the trivia, Shatner promoted Priceline.com.  After the contest,  caller Cheryl discussed a sexual technique she learned from a previous segment featuring Laura Korn, engaging in a sexually explicit conversation with the hosts about the technique involving hot and cold liquids, and her plans to use it on an upcoming date.  The segment concluded with the hosts preparing for their next guest, making jokes and cleaning the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to you.  Wow, wow.  After yesterday's show, we figured that would be a perfect song to start today's show.  Good song, Gulp.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I want to say hi to everyone that joined the Tuesday Night Hummer Club last night.  Congratulations.  Congrats, you're in.  Now we have hundreds and hundreds of members.  Yes, we do.  Man, what a day yesterday, huh?  Yeah, thanks for all the feedback and email and phone calls and faxes.  It looks like everyone enjoyed yesterday's show.  Laura was a big hit.  She enlightened the people with her sexploits and had that couple on the air that finished one of her little techniques 
[00:00:30]  and then came back on the air with us and the guy was just flabbergasted.  He was blown away.  Literally.  It's a technique, yeah, literally.  It's a technique from her new book, 52 Invitations to Great Sex,  and she left with a couple of loose ends because she wants, obviously, people to buy her book.  Mm-hmm.  So she doesn't tell us what some of these things are, you know, like what the couple did yesterday 
[00:01:00]  that made the guy, like, totally have this remarkable orgasm.  Right.  Well, well, Anthony.  We're going to tell you.  Yeah, in my hand, Anthony, I got the page.  All right.  This is what the couple did yesterday.  Okay.  How are you going to be able to read this, Opie?  What do you mean?  You're going to finesse around some of these words.  Yeah, we will.  All right.  We're going to do it later on in the show.  We got it.  All.  We, too, got to tease it a little bit.  I mean, we're willing to give out the secret, but we need you guys to listen a little bit today.  Yeah.  So we will give away the secret of what the couple was doing that had the guy just freaking 
[00:01:30]  out.  And we also, I think, can find the whole thing about the blue balloon from yesterday's show.  Yeah.  I don't know what that's about.  We still got to find it, but I think we know where it is.  Some reason.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, there it is.  The blue balloon, number 41 in the book.  We'll give away this, too, today.  Yeah.  Because we got to get back to our faithful listeners, though.  Of course.  They stand by us, day in and day out. 
[00:02:00]  So that's one thing to look forward to on the show today.  Let them have to wonder what happened.  Right.  Can't have that.  No.  No.  They waited 24 hours.  Now they need the answer.  Right.  And we will do that.  And I guess we're ready to rock and roll.  Yes, we are.  Are you and Carol all, you know, fine now, Anthony?  God, I wish the mics were up yesterday after we got off.  What did we get off the air about, what, 725, 730 yesterday?  Yeah, something like that.  So Carol's on after us?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  And she's waiting outside because she's not really allowed in here when we're in here.  No.  On the air.  She was told to wait until we leave the studio and then she's allowed to come in.  There's a little friction between Opie and Carol, usually.  Yeah.  And a general underlying friction between the show as a whole being Opie and Anthony and Carol.  She just doesn't get our show at this point.  She really has a problem with Opie.  Yeah.  She called me a meathead, I guess.  Yeah.  To everyone.  See, she can't help herself.  She runs around and talks about me.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  She runs into everyone's office.  Mm-hmm.  And the latest is I'm a meathead.  Yeah.  So now yesterday.  And she also thinks we're klepto.  So, you know, Sunday when we throw the Super Bowl party at one of our listeners' house,  she's telling everyone, you know, you better not win because Opie and Anthony will steal  stuff from your place.  Yeah, we might steal something from the house.  So I guess she's trying to have some fun with us, so we'll have fun with her back.  Yeah, it's all about fun.  So, uh, and then yesterday she comes in here and she unloads on me.  I mean, I know she hates Opie. 
[00:03:30]  She lets you have it.  But then she let me have it.  See, we have a lot of newspapers around the studio.  They're spread out all over the console here.  I bring in my four newspapers.  I have my little area right here.  Little things that I clean up when I'm done with.  And, uh, I was just getting up.  Laura Korn was leaving the studio.  And Carol just unloaded.  Uh, clean up this mess.  I deserve a little more respect than this. 
[00:04:00]  Uh, you, this is a mess in here.  I was like, Carol, we're just walking out.  I mean, we're just finishing up.  Every time I come in here, it's a mess.  Every time I come in here.  How am I supposed to see, uh, uh, how am I supposed to see Eddie Chung point at me  and tell me when I'm supposed to talk with newspapers all over the place?  How am I supposed to intro the next, uh, Led Zeppelin song?  And say W-N-E-W-D-U.  With all these newspapers all over.  Like, oh my God, she's ragging me. 
[00:04:30]  She just lost it on you.  She got all pissed.  And then she's giving, uh, Laura Korn crap.  Yeah.  Our guest.  Our special guest.  Our favorite guest.  And, and we were still in the process of leaving.  Like, Rick hadn't even come in to clean everything up yet or anything.  Right.  You know, we were just getting everything out of the way.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, from running late.  Mm-hmm.  And she unloaded.  I don't have to walk into this.  So she, she just gave us hell.  Mm-hmm.  Gave you hell.  Yeah.  Because she doesn't acknowledge me anymore. 
[00:05:00]  No, no.  So, um, yeah, she's all mad at, mad at me now, too.  Like, she needs a lot of area for her show prep.  What is her show prep?  Maps.  IQs.  What is her show prep, really?  But Eddie has to point at me and I have to go, a diva-doo in a diva-doo.  That's what she does, gang.  We're just telling it like we see it.  She has someone run the whole damn board, play the music and everything.  And, and this poor sap, Eddie, who's, who's known in the, in this city. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  For being a rock and roll DJ.  Mm-hmm.  Has to point to her to tell her when to talk.  I mean, you know, if that's what you do, I'm fine.  But she just gives us hell.  Like, do you need a clean area to do that?  And, she acts like she needs all this counter space to prepare her breaks or something.  I can't see when you, newspapers piled up.  You people that are in here are annoying me. 
[00:06:00]  I, I can't get the lid out.  And then she's all pissed because Laura Korn was using her mic.  She goes, yeah.  Is this girl all naked using my mic?  Naked?  Listen to our show.  It had nothing about some slut hanging out with Opie and Anthony.  We learned a lot about sex yesterday.  That was months ago.  That was months ago.  We had the naked slut on your chair.  So, there you go.  Yeah.  She was a little annoyed yesterday.  At you, for once.  I don't know.  I thought she liked me, hated you.  But, I guess now what? 
[00:06:30]  She tells everyone that she really, you know, she doesn't mind you.  That I'm the problem.  Yeah.  So.  You're the antichrist.  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I guess we'll be back after this.  All right.  We're ready to rock.  Facts line 212-957-WNEW.  Request line 212-757-1027.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  Collective soul from Dosage. 
[00:07:00]  That's heavy.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  And we're getting so busy already, I forgot to tell you what song to listen for this hour.  Later this hour, when you hear All Along the Watchtower by Hendrix,  be the 10th caller to win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers,  and you'll qualify to have a Super Bowl party at your house.  We're doing that Sunday.  God help us.  We're a little scared about this concept they came up with down the hall,  but we're going with it.  We're just hoping we get to go to a cool listener's house. 
[00:07:30]  I'm going to be sitting there watching the game.  All of a sudden, the cops bust in because I'm sitting on two kilos of Coke.  Oh, wow.  We didn't tell you?  Yeah, Opie and Anthony brought it, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some husband comes over.  Because we're at his girl's house.  These are the guys.  Plenty of nightmares can happen.  Well, we can't back out now.  This Sunday, we will be at one of our listeners' houses  with a 53-inch Sony projection screen TV watching the big game, the Super Bowl. 
[00:08:00]  The big game?  Did I say the big game?  Yeah.  The Super Bowl.  Missing for like a week.  Stuck in the basement of some house,  chained up while some guy goes,  bring out the gimp.  Oh, Opie, this is a great idea.  Boy, I know you can't talk, Opie.  You got the rubber red ball in your mouth. 
[00:08:30]  This could be the wackiest thing we've ever done in our radio careers.  I hope we're okay.  I think we'll do just fine.  Yeah.  We got a lady on the line here.  She got really hot and worked up over our show last night, Anthony.  Ooh.  We had Laura Cornyn, our favorite sexpert.  And I don't think many people turned off the radio yesterday.  Very hard to turn off.  That's the impression we're getting through the instant feedback,  the email and the faxes and the phone calls.  But this girl was so worked up, she ran to Barnes & Noble to get the book. 
[00:09:00]  So let's talk to her, see what she's all about.  Hi, who's this?  It's Carrie.  Carrie, I heard you got really worked up listening to us last night.  Oh, yeah.  Car ride home.  There we go.  And then I get home, have the guy turn it on, listen to it.  We hopped in the car, went to Barnes & Noble and bought the book.  Get out of here.  Wow.  No joke.  Did you try any of the techniques in the book?  Oh, yeah.  We tried the velvet tongue, whichever one.  I think that was it.  Number five.  That's one of our famous ones, the velvet tongue.  The honey and the herbal tea.  So you guys are driving to the bookstore, you're all worked up and everything? 
[00:09:30]  Of course.  All tingly.  Of course.  Wow.  Not only checking out Laura Korn's book, but all the other ones that were there, too.  Very cool.  Now, so did you guys get off last night?  Of course.  Well, he got off more than I did.  Was he really into it?  Yes, definitely.  More than usual?  Definitely.  Now, explain the velvet tongue, because this is one of her better techniques.  Okay.  You've got to get herbal tea, honey, and a naked man.  That's how she describes it in the book.  All right.  Now, be careful how you explain it. 
[00:10:00]  Go ahead.  Okay.  Go ahead.  And then you have to heat up the tea and whatnot, put the honey in the tea, and then just start  from the top on a man's face and work his way right down and start doing the Hummer  thing.  Right.  You have to keep drinking the tea throughout the whole thing to make sure your mouth's hot.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  And then if you want, add a little honey.  To his private part, however you want to word it.  Hot and smooth.  Exactly.  And he just went...  Very stimulating, he says. 
[00:10:30]  He went nuts?  He went absolutely nuts.  No, it also works, I hear.  What?  I hear, because I know Anthony's ready to pop in here.  You alternate between the warm tea and, like, a cold liquid.  Hey, I'll have to try that next time.  All right.  All righty.  But it worked for you.  It did.  Awesome.  All right.  Thank you very much, guys.  All right.  I'm glad we could help.  Yes.  Now, you guys are officially members of the Tuesday Night Horror Club, too, I guess.  Was that the first time for that?  That was the first time I've ever been listening to you guys was last night.  Oh. 
[00:11:00]  Come on.  I just got introduced to you guys, because I moved into a new office, and the guy I'm  rooming with listens to you guys constantly.  Oh.  We're doing this type of stuff every day.  Pass the word for us.  Now, we're always listening.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Man, we've got to get the word out on this damn radio show.  It's the first time she listened.  That pains me.  I know.  God, you'd hope people have been listening for a while, and you'll get that big reaction.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, well. 
[00:11:30]  That's okay.  They're coming aboard, Opie.  Slowly but surely.  Yes.  We're building our little army.  Yes.  All right.  We're getting lots of requests for Stephen Lynch songs today.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's Carol Miller in the studio with us.  Wow.  Hi, Carol.  How are you?  You want to intro the next record for us?  Make nice with us?  Are you going to let her intro the next record?  Yeah, give her that mic over there.  Okay.  All right, Carol.  Whenever you're ready.  Oh, forget it. 
[00:12:00]  We'll do it ourselves.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Jimi Hendrix.  All along the watchtower, it's Opie and Anthony.  That was the song you had to be listening for this hour.  To qualify to have a Super Bowl party at your house, where we bring the 53-inch Sony projection  screen TV.  And I think we have the winner on the line here.  Hi, N.E.W. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, this is John from Queens.  Hey, John.  What's going on?  Yo, man.  You guys are the best.  Hey, thanks.  You're our latest qualifier.  Oh, great, man.  Every day I go to my second job.  My third job's NYPD.  I don't make enough money over there, so I got my two jobs.  I'm just about mayor.  And I listen to you guys all the time, man.  You guys are the best.  Hey, thank you very much.  We'll just spread the word, you know?  Excellent.  No problem.  And make sure all your pals realize that we don't support cop killers here at N.E.W.  Excellent.  You guys are the best, so I'll keep it up.  All right.  Hold on the line. 
[00:13:00]  You have won the $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers, and now you're qualified  to have a Super Bowl party at your house.  That means Anthony and I would come over your house with this 53-inch screen TV from Sony,  and we would just have a blast.  So good luck on that, okay?  Excellent.  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  Cool.  Nice guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Good deal.  I got Stephen Lynch all queued up and ready to go here.  People can't get enough of our pal Stephen Lynch, another fine guest on our radio show.  Jen doesn't like this song. 
[00:13:30]  Jen doesn't like, why?  Well, she's, you know, likes cats.  Well, I got cats.  Kittens and everything.  I got cats.  You got cats.  There's still some humor in this, I believe.  Automatically entered.  It's that simple.  Just log on to WNW.com.  Man, cute little spot you did there.  Why?  Come on.  Let me hear it one time live, please.  $5,000.  I'm a hack.  How many takes did you have to do?  Come on.  That was one. 
[00:14:00]  One take?  One take in?  Oh, yeah.  That's cute.  You're getting spot.  Oh, yeah.  We're having fun today.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Checking out another track from Up.  That's R.E.M. and Lotus.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Hey.  And for this break, we brought in Mark from production  because he's brought up some interesting...  Hi there.  ...points about video games.  I must start, though, by saying thank you to Rob David 
[00:14:30]  from Morganville, New Jersey.  I got into N.E.W. today, Anthony,  and I opened my mail.  Yeah, I see.  And he sent me the Tomb Raider 3,  Adventures of Lara Croft, All Secrets Exposed.  There's some pictures of Lara in there.  Look how hot she looks.  There's one like she's naked.  She's squatting on a chair or something.  Well, that one's pretty good right there.  What a digital rack.  Isn't that something?  She's the hottest animated creature 
[00:15:00]  since Jessica Rabbit.  It beats Ms. Pac-Man.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, look, look.  It's all shaded, so you can't really see her vitals,  but she's looking hot after a hard day of combat.  Yeah, if you're a faithful listener to the show,  Anthony and I are pretty much hooked on games.  I got the PlayStation.  I'm doing Tomb Raiders 3,  and Anthony, of course, is the Half-Life master at this point.  Half-Life is my life.  He's a multiplayer online mother-hucker. 
[00:15:30]  They call it Half-Life,  but it should be full life or no life.  Yeah, you spend all your life playing it once you get it.  Well, this is where Mark comes into the discussion from production.  Mark came in, and you're losing it.  You're addicted or something.  Yeah, I got this as a Christmas gift.  Now, I've never been a game player.  I've always been into, like, photo design and web page  and that sort of thing.  Get the game.  Play it for a couple hours the first week.  Try to get the hang of the keys, the buttons, the moves.  That's four or five hours the second week.  Suddenly, I finish the first level. 
[00:16:00]  Kill off all the aliens.  Go, this is cool.  Yeah.  Suddenly, it's gone from a game now to an obsession.  See?  I warned you.  I get home late.  I talk to my wife for a couple of seconds.  The computer boots up.  Play it until I go to sleep.  Wake up in the morning.  Because I've thought about it now for six hours and sleeping.  Of course.  Next move.  Play it for that half hour.  I can catch another train. 
[00:16:30]  I don't have to be to work on time.  It's a little bit for me here.  It's so...  You reach that crossover point.  But you're still getting sleep, right?  Very little, but...  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, at least you're still sleeping.  It's in 3D now.  Right.  And while you're away from the game,  all you're thinking about is the game.  And how to make that move.  How can I do this?  I've got to get up the ladder and onto the elevator.  Yeah.  Right now in my head...  Every half-page website.  Uh-huh.  Half-page, yeah.  Yeah.  Every cheat sheet.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't want to do that.  No, no, you can't cheat. 
[00:17:00]  Well, I've got the cheat manual.  I might have to take a peek.  Because all day long, I'm like,  okay, if I jump from the ledge to the other ledge with the cobra,  now if I grasp onto the end of the ledge and then shimmy over,  then I might have a shot at killing the cobra  before he knocks me back down into the waterfall area.  That's all I think about.  When you were talking about this around Christmas time,  I'm thinking, how can somebody be so obsessed?  Oh, don't even.  Don't even.  Have you...  Suddenly something snaps in the back of your brain.  Yeah, it does.  And what do you think about? 
[00:17:30]  You're fully immersed into this simulation.  It's crazy.  Have you gotten past some of the aliens?  Right.  Have you gotten to some of the grunts?  No, not yet.  The armed grunts?  No.  Oh, yeah.  I just realized that I am nowhere in the game level.  It's all real cute.  You're in Black Mesa Research Facility,  and some experiment goes awry,  and these aliens transport over into your dimension.  And you're killing these aliens,  and you've got to help these scientists,  and there's some security people that help you.  It's all very fine and well. 
[00:18:00]  And then the army arrives,  and to my dismay,  I think they're going to help me kill some of the aliens.  It's like, the scientist is like,  oh, the military has arrived, you know,  as I laid a crowbar over his head.  And then I see the army.  It's like, oh, good.  Hey, guys.  They're there.  Wait until you see them.  They're there to make sure no one leaves the place.  It's a very well-designed game.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  It's funny.  You said it all, though.  It starts out as a game,  and it turns into an obsession where you're like, 
[00:18:30]  you know, I think I can survive on two hours sleep.  You know, I don't need to eat breakfast this morning  or cut my teeth.  Constant battle.  I think I could take the 840 train  and be just maybe 20 minutes late for work.  Yeah.  It's a rip.  Well, God bless you.  I hope you make it through.  Did you eat the Cobra yet?  Are you...  No, I had to do this to myself.  I haven't played the game in three days  because I was really obsessed.  My mind was racing at night.  I'm walking down my hallway going,  wow, check this out, man. 
[00:19:00]  3D.  I'm just like...  My, like, visual senses are so sharp right now.  I was like, check out the table, man.  It's in 3D.  Look how easy I could turn my head  and look into the bathroom.  You shimmy down the hallway.  Yeah.  Right, right, right, right.  My wife is thanking Bill Gates from Microsoft.  I haven't been able to play my Half-Life game  since I tried to boot up Windows 98  on my desktop at home.  It went into the laptop here.  I put it at home. 
[00:19:30]  I got no sound.  And there's no conflicts of resources.  There's no problem with the drivers.  For some reason, no sound.  I don't get a speaker icon in the corner.  That's it.  So now I got that problem  before I can get back to killing.  I will guarantee everyone  that Anthony will get a new computer by,  let's see, by what, 630?  January 27th.  You're not making it to Valentine's Day  with your current computer.  There's no way in the world.  I'm looking at it.  I don't know how you're going to talk Jennifer into it,  but I think a new computer 
[00:20:00]  is going to be arriving at Anthony's house very soon.  350, Mike Pentium 2.  That's what she wants for Valentine's Day.  Yeah, I know what Jen wants.  Sure.  She wants that 350.  Both want a hard drive.  Yeah.  She's a dirty girl.  Well, good luck to you.  Well, thank you.  Your marriage is really going to get strained.  Yeah, I see that already.  It's a great observation.  I came in here Monday.  I had no idea what happened in the world  because I did not turn on the TV for news or anything. 
[00:20:30]  Little hint for you.  When you get to the tentacle pit,  crawl.  He can't hear you if you crawl.  Well, I keep the TV on.  Yeah?  And the radio.  Everything's got to be on.  I've got the game.  I've got the TV.  I can get all my info and my news.  I know what's happening.  I know what's going on in the world.  See, that's the problem with PlayStation.  I have to give up the TV to play my game.  Didn't it kind of creep you out?  I was going to play it in PIP.  Didn't it creep you out?  Like, the first couple of nights you played,  after you went to bed,  you felt like, I don't know. 
[00:21:00]  I felt all creeped out at the game.  It gives you this whole atmosphere that,  you almost feel bad.  It's just too real.  It really is bad, yeah.  What happened to the cute, like, Mario Brothers game?  Yeah, like, I thought it was going to be fun  to shoot one of the scientists.  Yeah.  So I clip him in the leg,  and he runs away all scared.  He's like, oh, I'm injured!  And he's, like, running off,  and I felt like, hey, wait, I'm sorry.  You know, I really felt bad.  Hey, what do you got, man?  On your, uh, 
[00:21:30]  tell Anthony to go to his control panel and systems.  He can remove his present sound card configuration,  rerun the auto setup,  and it'll reconfigure it.  Really?  Yeah.  He tried it.  He tried it.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I got one of these damn Packard bells  with the wind modems  with the sound card on the modem card.  Oh, it sucks.  Totally.  Is it, it's an old model?  I'm going to gut it with a spade shovel.  I'm going to replace all the cards  with a sledgehammer.  Yeah, and it'll tell you it's no conflict. 
[00:22:00]  Meanwhile, you're damn well sitting there  knowing there's a conflict.  There's a conflict.  There's a game I can't play.  I'm in conflict.  It's a conflict.  It's a conflict.  All right, man.  You can try it by reconfiguring,  looking for a new modem,  select a generic modem  and then try to reselect the sound card.  Thank you, Mr. Wizard.  Good luck.  All right, man.  One more real fast.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  Yeah, I was listening about the sound card.  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  Uh, I had the same problem  when I went from Windows 3.1  to Win95, lost my sound. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  It turned out that I needed a new sound card  because it didn't recognize the sound driver.  Yeah, that figures.  So I had to get a, you know,  brand new one, load it up,  put it, you know,  took out the old one,  put the new one in,  and two seconds later,  I got the sound,  got the little speaker on the bottom  and no problem after that.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if you need a new sound card  because it's not recognizing.  Maybe that's it.  Oh, well, thank you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Well, thank you for participating.  We're taking all the calls here  on Computer Show with Opie and Anthony.

Your wife says hi,  and she also says you'll be a member  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  in the very near future.  Oh, yeah.  Now we're giving personal messages.  1027-WNEW,  the Rock of New York.  The latest from the Goo Goo Dolls.  Off Disney up the girl.  That's Slide.  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Want to once again  welcome all the new members 
[00:23:30]  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They like to check in on Wednesdays  and brag.  I think Wednesdays are a better day  than Tuesday  because a lot of people  join the club on Tuesday,  but then on Wednesday,  they need to brag.  Well, that's how guys are,  of course.  To us.  Well, I got a fax from a lady  that wants to brag.  She does.  Yes.  I like that.  Says,  Dear Opie and Anthony,  Hummer Club member announcement.  First, I just want to let you know  that I think it's a shame  that the men out there  are not being orally gratified 
[00:24:00]  more often.  Well, we'll agree.  The sun rising or setting  is usually the only reason  I need to want to savor  my boyfriend Dave.  It was admittedly amusing, however,  as I was strategically positioning myself  over him last night  to suddenly be able to say,  Honey, welcome to the Tuesday night  Hummer Club.  Oh, man.  I was hooched enough,  as it was,  by making sure he was being  want-want in front of a mirror.  But to also be a member of, 
[00:24:30]  wait,  but to also be a Hummer Club  member maker  was a bonus.  I always look forward  to hearing the personal recap  your listeners provide  on the Wednesday drive home.  Hint,  we're usually listening  from 4.30 to 5.  Kudos to both of you.  Love your show.  Keep it up.  Some pun intended.  Sincerely,  T.  The mirror thing's cool  if you don't have to look  at your face.  You know?  Like, occasionally,  you look over  and you get a different  perspective on things,  but if you don't want  to see your face  going at it. 
[00:25:00]  Making all those  dopey faces.  Yeah, you've got to see  yourself making the  orgasm faces.  Making the faces of love.  You ever just look  at your wife or girlfriend  and just start laughing?  No, that is not  the right thing to do.  Well, the faces we make  in the moment,  it's just damn funny.  The rose of passion.  If you take a step back  and just look at the face  that is being made,  it's pretty damn funny 
[00:25:30]  sometimes.  The whole package  looks pretty silly  when you really get down  to it.  But yeah,  the faces are...  Not ones you want  other people really seeing  and remembering.  No, of course not.  Well, yesterday,  everyone is talking  about Laura Korn  and her lovely advice  that she gave everyone.  And we're going to  give away one of her  secrets today  because you guys  are begging for it.  If you were listening  yesterday,  we had a couple  that Laura Korn  talked to off the air. 
[00:26:00]  Laura gave this couple  one of her techniques  from her new book.  The couple tried it out  and what happened,  Anthony?  When we talked to them  after they did it,  the guy was completely  exhausted  and just in that whole  post-orgasmic haze.  He wasn't even coherent.  And the girl was just  a giggling, happy gal  that she made her man  feel so good.  It was great.  It was very great. 
[00:26:30]  And then we asked the guy  if it was the best one  he ever had  and he said  without a doubt it was.  It's called  Stand Back.  I don't know how big  this damn thing  is going to get.  Now, I don't even know  what this is.  I don't even know  what this is yet.  Anthony, I haven't even  opened it yet.  I know.  I haven't read it.  I don't know.  I haven't opened it yet.  She wouldn't tell us.  Now, you know,  we're going to give away  the secret,  but we need you guys  to listen a little longer.  That's all.  That's all we ask  from our little radio show.  Yeah.  And you might have a friend  that was listening yesterday  and you guys have discussed, 
[00:27:00]  you know,  man, what did that girl  do to the guy?  At this moment in time,  it would be cool  to, you know,  call that friend  and tell him  to listen to the radio  because we're giving away  the secret  in the five o'clock hour.  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  I think that's cool.  And we're still trying  to find out  what the whole  blue balloon thing  was all about.  Yeah.  We're going to try  to find that as well  and give you that one.  I don't think  I get that one, Opie.  Well, she kind of explained it,  but not really, right?  Yeah, and it's kind of ridiculous.  Right.  I think. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Well, we'll get to that  in a little while.  Later this hour,  when you hear  Aerosmith,  Big Ten Inch,  be the 10th caller  at 212-757-1027  and you'll be  our latest qualifier  to win  a Super Bowl party  at your house.  That's where  Anthony and I  go with a 53-inch  Sony TV  to your house.  We show up  with the beer  and the soda  and the food  and we watch  the game together.  Yeah, we hang out  at your house.  Yeah.  Great freeloaders.  Well, we're bringing  cool TV and... 
[00:28:00]  Oh, it's going to be great.  All we ask though  is if you're like  a serial killer  or something,  please don't participate  in this particular,  you know, contest.  Yeah, we're kind of fearful.  There's other contests  out there  that you could  participate in,  but this one  we'd like you  to stay away from.  All of a sudden,  we walk in,  it's like,  what's the smell  in this house?  It smells like  dead animal.  Let me show you  my basement.  You can help me  dig the next hole.  Yes.  We don't want that.  If you deal  coke for a living.  Yeah, and you're 
[00:28:30]  going to be stashing  your kilos  under the couch  we'll be sitting on  when the cops bust in.  Yeah, this is not  a contest for you.  Don't participate.  Please don't participate.  If you have a hidden  room in your house  with the mask  with the zipper  over the mouth  and the red ball  that goes in your mouth  and you like using  terms like  time to bring out  the gym,  don't invite us over.  No, don't participate  in the contest.  NAW Radio DJs  Opie and Anthony  disappear after going  to a Super Bowl party  while we're in the  basement. 
[00:29:00]  All right?  Yeah.  All right,  so stick around  and listen for Arrowsmith  and if you've got  something for the show  you know what to do.  Give us a call.

[00:31:00]  yesterday but the guy got back on the phone and said not only was it uh the best one he ever had it  was uh it was absolutely incredible and and his memory got really really huge  shaft so we're going over that next and and next time we talk we'll uh robbing we will give that  away okay we might have a celebrity do it maybe we'll invite uh i don't know william shatner who 
[00:31:30]  knows who or the dice man or someone someone's got to read it for us okay and speaking of the super  ball anthony i dug up a little ditty from uh the opian anthony archives what do you got i got one of  our super bowl pranks oh these were these were brutal green bay green bay when the packers were  in the super bowl we called up green bay green bay we made believe we were a tv station  we got a schmuck on the on the phone and made him do some silly things thinking that he was going to win 
[00:32:00]  super bowl tickets if he did all this stuff for us i didn't know they had this ridiculous accent  yeah they got the fargo accent yeah it's like fargo hey hey margie margie  1027 wnaw the rock of new york pink floyd on the turning away days of the new before that the  downtown it's opian anthony for your ride home hey thanks for checking us out again we definitely  definitely definitely appreciate it thanks for all the feedback you guys are great seems like uh 
[00:32:30]  the tides are changing a little bit anthony yes we're starting to feel a little love with our radio  show well don't get carried away i said a little the first uh seven months there was a lot of hate  in the air but uh seems like there's a bunch of people that are starting to dig the show a little  bit and we just want to acknowledge you all right well yeah it's just a uh just takes a little time  to get used to us it's an acquired taste we'll be the first to admit that all right where do we begin 
[00:33:00]  anthony oh my goodness uh yesterday we had laura corn in the studio yes she's our favorite guest of  all time we've been uh doing radio together you and i for five years we've had laura corn on i don't  know five or six times she's a sexpert sexpert we like to call her yeah she comes up with these new  innovative ways of uh having sex with your favorite partner and uh usually it's uh something a little  out of the ordinary maybe a trick that's interesting something that feels real good spontaneity and 
[00:33:30]  things like that she's great at spicing up relationships yeah instead of the same old thing  over and over again she comes up with new and inventive ways uh to do the nasty basically right  her latest book is 52 invitations to great sex and uh she just was absolutely wild yesterday to  order her book by the way a lot of people standing by for the number it's 1-800-547-BONK  1-800-547-BONK now if you were listening yesterday on the show uh she took a couple aside off the radio 
[00:34:00]  and uh described one of the techniques that you can find in her latest book to this couple and then we  checked in with a couple a half hour later the guy could barely speak the girl was happy the guy  was happy he said it was the best orgasm he's ever had yeah the best hummer he's ever had kind of  amazing just happened to be on uh tuesday night so and they became members members of the tuesday 
[00:34:30]  night hummer club uh everyone after uh the couple left the show were freaking out wondering what this  girl did to this guy to get this uh type of reaction yeah and now laura i understand she needed  to sell some books so she uh she just went she didn't want to give the the the trick away she  leaves it a mystery but we have a feeling that we probably sold laura corn about 10 000 books yesterday  and our listeners are important to us so we're gonna tell yeah we need to give a little back to 
[00:35:00]  our listeners for sticking by us so i got the technique in my hand here anthony okay and uh we're gonna read  it to the ladies right now there's a lot of language in this that could get us thrown off  the radio so remember that old game uh ad lib was it ad lib mad lib mad lib right mad libs we need to  come up with a uh another name for penis all right i could come up with one i guess all right what do  you got i don't know just read you'll come up with it yeah just pop up with something i guess all 
[00:35:30]  time all right here's the technique from yesterday's show your invitation ladies is quite mysterious this  week you're asking your lover to bring a tie and a tray to the bedroom all right set them aside at  first you won't need them for the long kisses and mutual striptease that begin your evening  just kidding well once you've uh once you're both warmed up ask him to turn around while you  blindfold him with the necktie sure men are visual creatures they like to see you having sex but this 
[00:36:00]  time you don't want anything to distract from the rather intense physical sensations you have in store  and you don't want him to know when they're coming oh have him lay on his back and place the tray in the  bed next to him go to the kitchen for your secret ingredients hot and cold ah that is a mug of tea or  some other hot liquid and ice cubes swimming in a glass of water put them on the tray now play with  his oh snuffleupagus and his mind that's the word you came up with oh yeah that's cute all right 
[00:36:30]  squeeze his snuffleupagus draw his snuffleupagus into your mouth tease it the way you might on any other  night then invoke the magic of the velvet tongue take a sip of hot tea and let the warmth flood your  mouth don't swallow it at all try to hold a bit of steamy liquid as you plunge your lips past the  snuffleupagus of his trembling erection oh a sigh escapes from your lover as the unexpected warmth 
[00:37:00]  envelops his most tender part his snuffleupagus like flame under a kettle the few minutes of added heat  brings him to a simmer but before he could boil over pop a half melted ice cube in your mouth  and dive back down the length of his snuffleupagus his entire body will twitch with the shock he'll gasp at  his he'll gasp as his want rise off the bed but his buttocks his buttocks rises off the bed just a few 
[00:37:30]  seconds is all you need and probably probably all he can take before you switch back to your overheated  mouth this battle can go on for quite a long while the warmth draws blood to the surface swelling is  already engorged snuffleupagus the chill keeps him from coming uh oh uh coming uh uh to your aid and helping  you uh with making more tea exactly that's what i meant to say uh the control needless to say is 
[00:38:00]  all yours the pressure will build through several cycles of this exquisite torture until he's ready to  wah wah this of course is the exact opposite of the condition for which those boys needed a cold  shower they used to call blue balls remember well i have a name for this kind of explosive super  orgasm snowballs ho ho ho frosty had them too which just explains why he was such a jolly happy soul  so there you go there's the technique it's a hummer uh where the girl uses hot tea or something 
[00:38:30]  and alternates with cold ice like ice cubes in water and uh you're blindfolded that adds to the  sensation the tie blindfolded part all right there you go give that one a try that was what all the  hype was about yesterday i wonder how many people are racing home right now to try that try that out  if you try it before seven please give us a call 1027 wnaw the rock of new york metallica turn the page 
[00:39:00]  from garage inc and van halen too it's opie and anthony hey and look who has entered the uh the studio  here ben the fag ben the fag has made it back into the studio what's up ben nothing we were looking for  now listen uh you know before your boss roger gets mad we forced you into the studio because i'm  hearing rumors you're not allowed on our show anymore i told rick to ask permission you have to 
[00:39:30]  ask permission to come into the studio now how come the people we like to have in here uh aren't allowed  in here and then other people uh like that come in here and annoy us just walk in yeah don't take  that personally but we have fun with uh with ben the fag because he just puts his foot in his mouth  all the time you might remember ben was in here about a month and a half ago uh just relating a cute  little story how he was hanging out with uh guys that he thought were girls they were transvestites 
[00:40:00]  transsexuals transsexuals please yeah right how do you know it was the night of the how do you know  they were transvestites or transsexuals if you said you didn't get their pants off they had boobs  so you ever see the chicks with uh you're a mess man so so he's he says that every guy was looking  at him as he's leaving this bar with these three girls yeah saying wow look at that guy leaving with  the three hot chicks meanwhile we all know they're looking going look at the guy leaving with three 
[00:40:30]  guys yeah just like a girl the girls and this was after our christmas party and and ben was very  liquored up very horned up and uh you finally figured out they were guys when the guy was  stroking your leg yeah about an hour into that that was when we went to the second bar right and then  you guys were making out or something you felt the razor stubble it didn't happen come on man  nothing happened nah well now i get emails from fans that have heard me on the show yeah they're  emailing me here well ben the fag supposedly is actually not gay it's it's a horrible nickname you 
[00:41:00]  have uh well there's just this whole thing floating around him he insists he's not gay his uh uh lifestyle  that he tells us about isn't a gay lifestyle i mean he's out with girls all the time he brags about all  the the girls he's banging and stuff we haven't seen any we haven't seen you know he says he does  yeah so we just call him ben the fag he does live in the village yeah but you know who's to say what  that means there's a lot of straight people that live in the village of course and he goes to 
[00:41:30]  questionable bars yeah which brings us to what he said the other day in the office he's talking  about a bar do you remember the name of the bar you the tunnel we were talking about the tunnel again  because a kid had died there right a kid had died there we were bringing that up we were talking about  that in the office and i said the weekend i said ben is that a gay bar and ben goes no it's only about  half gay now i don't know check me here but if half the crowd is gay to me that's a gay bar like 
[00:42:00]  the bars i go to i wouldn't say maybe 99.9 percent is straight but it's pretty close  you know you know let's bring the percentages down too if 10 of the people in a bar are gay i would  call that a gay bar yeah yeah and they say 10 of the population is gay sure all right so 11 percent  11 gay bar yeah right yeah because now you're over the standard for humanity so ben goes no it's not a 
[00:42:30]  gay bar because only 50 of the people in it 50 percent and that isn't a gay bar once again ben the  bag putting his foot in his mouth but i guess his foot is better than other things that could be  exactly it's like i said i got all these things like going against me i live downtown yeah i used to  work on another uh different radio station yeah he worked with a jock that uh is known to be uh 
[00:43:00]  well let's face it roam the gay uh no he worked with a guy that is gay yeah he lives the gay lifestyle  uh he's on new york radio and he pretends to be straight yeah i hate people who do that but  whatever that'll get you thinking another phony on the radio let's pretend we like girls and you  worked for this guy yes i did did he used to like you know yeah oh here ben um oh look i oh i dropped  the card again could you bend over and pick that up he never yeah my friends forget about it but he never 
[00:43:30]  hit on you no he never hit on you no but my friends if i had friends in the studio forget about  it was disgusting maybe he just likes straight guys show all right so listen so so you're in this  you're in this bar it's 50 gay but to you it's a straight club straight bar and then he tries to  abuse anthony and i by saying what what did i say i don't remember what i said i called you guys old  old farts because we're not going to a place that's 50 gay yeah because he's clubbing he knows the 
[00:44:00]  scene he's trying to tell us that's the scene you know 50 gay i guess is the scene and he's like  what are you old farts no yeah that's it well because we're old you darn kids well if that's  what it takes i'll just stick to sucking on some uh  thank you anthony thank you popeye that's what it means to be old you know i'm gonna stay right  where i am boy i'm old i just don't know about kids these days you know right i guess you all like 
[00:44:30]  uh you know one in the keister i don't know i guess i'm old i don't know what's happening with  uh young guys like you ben in your early 20s and then and then ben has to say that uh that the gay  clubs are the places that have the best music well yeah you've never heard that before when you bring  a group of girls to like here it is you've never heard it i just repeat that all night long and you 
[00:45:00]  have the mating call of the homo right you like that's that's the music yeah yeah that's it are you  one of those guys that that comes up with excuses you're in this so-called straight club where half  the place is gay and then next thing you know you're on the dance floor dancing with guys and  you don't know how that happened i don't know i was just into it and dancing i was just sitting there  you know minding my own business you know drinking my uh screwdriver next thing i know i'm on the dance

[00:46:00]  way back when with the transsexuals i don't dance but my friend that was with me was like getting  down with the transsexuals i mean dancing no he was getting down like you know you know getting down  with them and i was sitting there you had your hand on his leg i know they had their hand on my leg and  you didn't do anything i swear and you thought it was a girl you mean to tell me if a girl is at a  bar with you rubbing your leg for 40 minutes you won't make a move but you're this guy who's always  getting late it doesn't make sense you obviously did something with this thing i did not you didn't

[00:58:00]  They've been fighting for years over that skinny bitch.  You're watching the early cartoons.  The late ones, it's always the same.  That whore's always out with Bluto.  I don't understand what you see in Olive Oil myself.  Well, you never seen her without her clothes gone.  Thank God.  She's got quite the pussky.  Now, what does her private area look like again?  The sea hag. 
[00:58:30]  But it works like a sea urchin.  You ever see a sea urchin?  When it sticks your finger in it?  That's what the pusskies like.  Very nice.  You always think of things in nautical terms. 
[00:59:00]  Did you take care of that odor problem that Olive Oil was having?  Oh, low tide, yeah.  Oh.  She needed some Monskastat-7s.  Cleared it right up.  Smells as fresh as sweet pea.  No more Pravsklumsk with the pussky.  Okay.  All right.  Are you guys members of the Tuesday Night Raw Club?  Yes, we were Chatska members again last night. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah?  How did it go?  She gave me a hummer.  She did.  But I inadvertently ate some spinach right beforehand.  Shot her right through the hole.  All right.  Oh, that's a good tone. 
[01:00:00]  I'm Popeye the pussky man.  Thank you.  I'll be off.  There he goes, everyone.  Popeye.  Where's Anthony?  I don't understand.  When Popeye's on the show...  Why?  Why?  Why?  Anthony, you missed Popeye again.  Oh, my God.  I was just out talking with Lois Lane.  Was Superman here?  That old gag. 
[01:00:30]  That clever ruse.  There was someone left a pipe.  All right.  Well, there's the answer to your question, I think, Scott.  I think.  All right.  Hey, are we going to do a Star Trek trivia before we leave here today?  Sure.  Now, what's the matter?  We got to talk to our listeners.  We like to do trivia every once in a while.  We like to keep it fun, though.  We got so reamed yesterday.  We were doing Brady Bunch trivia.  This lady calls up and asks the hometown of the Brady Bunch. 
[01:01:00]  She swears it was Verona.  Yeah, and that's just not true.  It was wrong, and we had to stop the contest because we weren't sure if it was right or wrong.  And it was just a mess.  If you call with an answer to one of our trivia questions, or you call with, how does this work again?  Wait a minute.  I have to come up with the answer to your question.  Yes.  Yes.  But make it fun for everyone.  Then we had another person call up, and they said, what was the hometown of Carol Brady before she met Mike Brady? 
[01:01:30]  What ever happened to, like, you know, what was the name of the cousin, or the dog, or the doll?  You can make them hard, but at least know the answers and know that your answer is right.  Yeah, you can make them hard, but make them so people at home can play along.  Yeah.  Was there ever an episode where they explained what Carol Brady's hometown was?  Oh, who knows?  This guy was on drugs.  But it just wrecked it, and now we're not sure if we can do this anymore. 
[01:02:00]  So we'll try one more time.  We'll try one more time?  Yes.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're going to do Star Trek trivia today.  I believe William Shatner himself will be in the studio to give the answers.  First person to stump Mr. Shatner with Star Trek trivia from the TV show.  Yes.  Just the TV series.  Just the original TV series.  No second generation and no movies.  Yes.  Okay.  Now the first person to stump Mr. Shatner will win, Rick. 
[01:02:30]  He's got his little prize list over there.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Call him off guard.  That's okay.  Hey, yo.  You guys sniffing into the microphone.  I think I broke it.  $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Pierce and qualify for the Super Bowl party at their house.  Okay, very good.  Let's end the fact.  So if you've got a Star Trek trivia question, something we can play along with, please.  Yes.  Don't ask for the serial number of the ship or something stupid. 
[01:03:00]  NCC 1701.  Wow, very good.  I hope William Shatner's as good at trivia as him.  So do I.  Oops.  All right.  212-757-1027.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Eric Clapton from Journeyman.  Bad Love.  Bruce Springsteen from Tracks Before That and Seven Angels.  It's Opie.  And once again, Anthony's not in the studio.  But we do have William Shatner.  Yes.  It's kind of strange how that happens.  Captain James D. Kirk. 
[01:03:30]  Space.  The final frontier.  These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.  Its five-year mission to explore strange new pusky.  Are you good with Star Trek trivia, Mr. Shatner?  I lived it.  I know everything about Star Trek.  And you like Priceline.com, don't you?  I love Priceline.  Of course.  Name your own price.  How can you lose? 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Here's the deal.  We got a bunch of listeners on hold here.  Yes.  Okay.  On your primitive telephone system.  Well, yeah.  I use my communicator.  Uhura.  Uhura.  Oh.  I must be out of a sales range or something.  Damn thing.  Okay.  Here's the deal.  The first person to stump you.  Yes. 
[01:04:30]  Will win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Pierce  and qualify to have a Super Bowl party at their house.  Are you ready for the challenge?  Yes, I am ready for your challenge.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello there.  Who's this?  Uh, Opie and, uh, Mr. Shatner.  Hi.  Opie and Mr. Shatner.  How are you guys?  Very well.  Dude, I've been trying to get in touch with you guys every day for like the last two weeks.  I call you every day on the way home from work.  Well, now you have us, mister.  What's your action?  Um, I want to know who the first captain of the Enterprise was. 
[01:05:00]  Uh, my predecessor.  Also had Spock as a first officer.  That would be Captain Christopher Pike.  Very good.  Not too bad.  Thank you.  Thanks for trying.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  How you doing?  Hello.  Oh, Hora.  Did you lose this man?  No, he's here.  Open a hailing frequency.  Do you have a question for me, James Deeker?  Of course I do.  What's your question?  In the episode where the M-Surprise was retrofitted with a combat-ready autopilot, what did they refer to the captain as? 
[01:05:30]  Ah, yes.  I remember that one.  The M-5 unit was installed on the Enterprise, and it started lots of trouble, but they called me the Captain Dunsel.  Bingo.  Bye.  Thanks for trying, man.  Thank you.  Hi, you got a question for Mr. Shatner?  Yeah, I sure do.  Your question for me, Captain James Deeker. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, James, remember when you were put on a planet with some kind of reptile-type alien to battle to the death?  Yes, I outwitted him by using basic compounds on the planet to build a cannon.  Yeah, that's it.  What was the name of that race?  That horrible race was the Gorn.  The reptilian Gorn creature.  You got me.  I kicked his reptilian ass.  Sure did, man.  All right, thanks for playing.  All right, bye.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yes.  Yo.  Yes.  Do you have a question for James Deeker? 
[01:06:30]  Yo, how's it going, Captain Kirk?  Very well.  You fiddling around with Uhura there?  You just get to business, mister.  All right.  All right.  That episode with Conor, with Ricardo Montalbán.  Yeah.  What book did he quote from in the end of the episode?  I believe he quoted from Moby Dick.  No!  You're wrong!  I got you.  What are you talking about? 
[01:07:00]  He quoted from Moby Dick.  I had him drop his shields, fired faces, his face looked like chubby.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It was Paradise Lost.  Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven.  Excuse me.  Excuse you?  I, perhaps, uh, you, uh, oh, I'm speaking of the movie.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.  You said the TV show.  Sorry, Captain Kirk. 
[01:07:30]  Guess I've been foiled again.  You've been foiled, dude.  I forgot.  Oh, by the way, by the way, I'm a weekly member of the club, dude.  I forgot I had dropped him off on 70 Alpha 6.  Yes, you did.  How could I be so stupid?  Oh, you seem to have emerged victorious.  Wow, congratulations.  What's your name?  Uh, uh, Mike Molina.  All right, Mike, where are you calling from?  Uh, I'm on a, I'm in my car phone right now. 
[01:08:00]  I'm down in Eaton Town.  All right, hold on the line.  Rick's going to get info from you.  All right, man.  Perhaps I'll play him a game double or nothing of that ridiculous three-level chess Spock used to play.  Oh, God.  How did I forget that?  Gone.  Once again, I'm foiled by gone.  Gone.  Gone.  Red alert.  Lock on phasers. 
[01:08:30]  Kling on bastards.  Killed my son.  Gone.  First, he tries to steal the Genesis device from me, and now he screws me up with a question.  Have I not seen the last of Tom's treachery?  Oh, yes, fire!  What the hell was that?  Oh, he's taking a hit.  Well, you did pretty well.  Damage report.  All decks. 
[01:09:00]  Holy Jesus.  Animative combat.  What the hell was that?  Oh, fire!  Fire!  Proton torpedo.  All right, well, there you go.  I got him!  Another round of Star Trek trivia.  You did quite well.  But he will never live to collect.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  The car is in Harvey Danger before that flagpole.  Sit-ah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I don't know.  Out the door, possibly?  Do you want to continue with the show today? 
[01:09:30]  Or do you want to just leave at seven?  Well, I don't want to ruffle any feathers around here.  God forbid.  God forbid we do that.  Everyone patiently waiting for the living legend to come on next.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't...  Maybe we better step aside.  Taking up time and that show, you know.  Yeah.  I don't want to do that.  Someone has something on line three here.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  This is Cheryl.  Hi, Cheryl.  Hi.  I'm calling regarding your show yesterday when you had Laura Korn on.  I was dying to know what that tip was when that couple was, she was giving her husband 
[01:10:00]  a Hummer.  Yeah.  Right.  And what that move was.  You know, stand back.  I don't know how big it's going to get.  What was the move?  What was the move?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This was supposed to be a technique that made the guy bigger than usual and his orgasm was  tremendous.  Exactly.  Remember he had no energy left?  Yeah.  She shoved an air hose in his ass and pumped him up to 68 pounds per square inch.  No, no, really. 
[01:10:30]  See, I have a date coming up.  You sound right.  And I was thinking about giving him a Hummer and I wanted to use this technique.  Wait, a date?  Well, yeah, for the weekend.  Is this, how many dates have you been on with this man?  About eight.  Oh, it's time.  It's time for the Hummer.  She eats at eight.  Yeah, it's good.  So I wanted to make it really excellent.  She eats at eight.  She eats at eight.  Wow, okay.  Are you like hot and stuff?  Yes.  Really?  Definitely.  Are you alive?  Good looking, slim.  How far have you gone with this guy in eight dates? 
[01:11:00]  Right.  How far have you gone?  Oh, how far?  Yeah.  You know, second base was a little grinding.  What's second base again?  I forget.  Second base is like touching down the, you've put your hand down his pants?  Not yet.  Has he touched your patch?  No.  What?  Oh, he's gone up your shirt.  Yeah.  Oh, that's second base.  Okay.  Yeah.  You got ample dairy, as they say?  Excuse me?  Ample dairy?  He's got a good size.  He's sporting.  Yeah.  It's seven o'clock. 
[01:11:30]  It's time to get rude here.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  No, I'm just curious to see how far girls go.  I've been married for a few years, so I'm not sure what the dating seems like anymore.  Well, I'm fairly conservative, but you know, when I'm ready, I'd like to give it my all.  Fairly conservative.  Eight dates?  Eight dates.  Over how long of a time period?  About five weeks.  Five weeks?  Is this the only guy you've been seeing in these five weeks?  What?  Is this the only guy you've been seeing in five weeks?  Oh, she's ready to go.  Yeah, okay.  She's ready.  This is a bit of a commitment.  Yes.  God, this lucky bastard. 
[01:12:00]  Does he have any clue that this might be coming tonight?  I don't think he has any idea.  Is it going to happen tonight or?  No, Friday.  Oh, Friday.  And now, will you make the move on him, or will you wait to see if he tries to make a move on you?  No, I'm going to make the move.  Oh, this guy is the luckiest man.  That's a lie.  So, he'll just be sitting there thinking it's going to be another nice date where he might get to cop a feel.  Exactly.  And all of a sudden, like, what do you do?  Do you reach over and put your hand there?  Yeah, what's the move? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, you know, it's throughout the kissing, and then I reach down, and then I'll just start undoing his pants.  Oh, no!  I hate her!  Wow, I just got, like, that tingle in my stomach when she's saying that.  Like, you can imagine, you're just sitting there, all right, making out, you've done this before, hand of the shirt, feeling all worked up, and all of a sudden, it's like, hey, wait, her hand.  Hey, she didn't do this before.  Oh, and then the guy's probably thinking he's just maybe getting a little manual manipulation.  Exactly.  And then, well, you start out that way, and then, uh, and then what? 
[01:13:00]  You just, like, look him in the eye, smile, and go south?  Yeah, go south, you know, work my way down slowly, a little tongue action by the belly, and work my way down.  This is the luckiest man on the face of the earth.  She's done this before.  Yeah.  You're dirty.  So I wanted to make it extra special, and I wanted to know the technique.  Well, we gave away the technique in the 5 o'clock hour.  Extra special, that is, I guess, like, how do you make that better?  Yeah.  I don't care what Laura Korn says, a bad one's a good one.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, we'll let you in on the secret. 
[01:13:30]  Maybe you could use this down the road.  I don't think it's good for a first one, because it's a little involved.  You've got to be boiling water and stuff.  You make some tea, or a hot beverage, and you have a cold beverage next to that, like a glass of ice water.  Don't forget about the tie, Anthony.  You use a tie to blindfold the guy, so he's naked in a chair blindfolded, so he doesn't know what's coming.  And then you drink the hot liquid, and you, uh, uh, uh, uh.  And then, right when he's going crazy, you take a mouthful of the cold liquid, and then you, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[01:14:00]  And the temperature change, like, drives him crazy.  And then you go on and off like that, until, uh, Eureka!  She's a gusher!  That's the technique.  That's it.  She's speechless.  I, uh, actually, I'm on my cell phone.  I think you guys are breaking up a little.  Oh, my God!  We just gave away the secret.  What did you hear?  I heard the hot and cold.  Yeah, you go back and forth like that with the guy blindfolded, so he doesn't know what's coming. 
[01:14:30]  That's excellent.  All right.  But believe me.  I don't know if I'll do the blindfold right away, because I think I'll, you know, it'll be a little overwhelming at first.  But I'll try the hot and cold, definitely.  No, he won't want to be blindfolded.  Not the first time.  You want to see that.  You want to look down and go, I can't believe this is happening.  Yeah.  Excellent.  I just want also you guys to know that you guys are incredible, and I listen to you every day on my drive home.  Oh, thank you.  You're incredible.  Oh, thanks.  But see, we've got to get off the radio now, because the living legend is next. 
[01:15:00]  Well, I'm glad that you have this thought now that you're getting off the air.  All right.  Well, we'll try that, and please call us back and let us know.  Yeah.  All right, I'll call you next week, let you know how it went.  Great.  Hey, Halls work pretty good, too.  Yeah, I heard that, and also Altoids.  Oh, the Altoids work?  Yeah, isn't that what Monica Lewinsky did?  Yeah, that's right.  She did do that.  We could talk to you for hours.  Yeah, I could.  This is just great.  So will he be a part of the Hummer Club, even if it's not on a Tuesday? 
[01:15:30]  Oh, no.  He is part of the luckiest man on the face of the earth club.  He doesn't even know.  Oh, that whole thing.  No, honestly.  Not a clue it's coming at you.  Yeah, no, honestly, it has to happen on a Tuesday for him to join the club.  All right, well.  But I don't think he'll be disappointed if it happens on a Monday.  One more question.  Or a Friday.  One more question.  I'll let you know it happened.  One more question, please.  Yeah.  Do you complete the act, let's say?  Definitely.  That's the best part is the end. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  All right.  I'm done.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you.  That's great.  She's out of there.  She is great.  All right, Ant.  Yeah.  Time to move aside, Opie.  You sure?  Yeah.  Wait.  Let me get my vacuum out.  Dust rags.  I got to clean up.  Yeah, Ant.  Why don't you take some time to clean up the Living Legends area so she's got a nice  work area.  Yeah.  Just vacuuming, making sure everything's just so. 
[01:16:30]  If you weren't listening earlier in the show, the Living Legend yelled at Anthony because  he left a mess and she said she couldn't work in the atmosphere with everything thrown  around the studio.  I hear newspaper gets windows cleaner with Windex.  Anthony.  Yeah, that's cleaning up real nice. 
[01:17:00]  Everything will be fine in no time.  Don't worry.  It'll be clean in here.  You need to vacuum a little more right over there.  Oh, yeah.  I missed this.  Oh, my God.  That's where she puts her pile of prep stuff.  That looks better.  I think it's clean enough for Carol to do her show.  Yeah, the Living Legend up next.  I think she's practicing in the other studio.  Would you like to hear?  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, you got that?  You can pull that up?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear it. 
[01:17:30]  Let's see.  All right.  She's getting ready. </pre>
