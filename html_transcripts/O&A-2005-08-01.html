<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts engaging in vulgar self-deprecation and insulting their staff, Ben and Steve.  They then aggressively dismiss negative media coverage, employing highly offensive language to discredit their critics.  A significant portion is dedicated to a furious, profanity-laced tirade against Phil Mushnick's column criticizing older video game players, with Opie and Anthony offering counterarguments and mocking Mushnick's perceived outdated views.  This segues into a broader discussion on media bias and the negative portrayal of video games.

The "Assault on the Media" contest is heavily featured, with the hosts playing audio clips of listener stunts.  Tony recounts a successful prank on a news reporter, while Buffalo Paul's attempts and other submissions are also discussed.  Winners of the July contest are announced: Tim from Springfield, MA (first place, MiFi and studio visit); Steve from Salem, MA (second place, an XM cooler, later considered for a prize upgrade); and Buffalo Paul (honorable mention). The August contest is introduced, featuring Mark from Philly's submission, which almost cost him his job. Prizes for August are initially subpar seat cushions, later upgraded to gift certificates and possibly a Comedy Cellar night.  The show then announces Ron and Fez's addition to their XM Satellite Radio lineup via a "golden ticket" scheme, simultaneously revealing a "fucko list" of disliked radio personalities, explaining their choices with abundant offensive language.

The show features an in-studio interview with Peter from the band In Flames, discussing their upcoming performance and musical style.  This abruptly transitions into a request for Peter to record a public service announcement against beating up special needs children, specifically a child named Russell in Newark, encouraging the use of expletives and referring to fans with a derogatory term.

Anthony recounts a gambling-filled weekend trip to Atlantic City, mentioning encounters with his mother, brother, and Tom Jones.  The hosts extensively discuss Paul, a staff member with a "no filter," recounting numerous instances of his offensive jokes, including the use of racial slurs.  Listener message boards and multiple listener calls are featured throughout.  The authenticity of a supposedly autographed Jack Nicholson picture and a Nirvana poster given to Opie is debated.  Additional gifts are received from Chris and Frankie D, including flame-themed merchandise for Steve.

A significant discussion focuses on Assemblyman Dov Hikind's proposed legislation allowing racial profiling of Middle Easterners in subway searches, with Opie and Anthony expressing support and criticizing the New York Civil Liberties Union's opposition.  A voicemail from Jimmy Norton is played, and Brother Weez's cancer remission is briefly mentioned.

A later segment delves into the ethics and effectiveness of racial profiling targeting Middle Eastern individuals, referencing the New York Civil Liberties Union and Wassam Nasser of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.  This is interspersed with a recurring, listener-submitted knock-knock joke, featuring numerous attempts at the punchline and interruptions.  Several listener calls offer opinions on racial profiling, terrorism, and the joke. A caller shares an airport security screening story involving a prosthetic leg. A heated, expletive-laden phone argument with an unidentified caller ensues.  The discussion also includes a purportedly miraculous Jesus statue and a clip of Manny Ramirez's reaction to a potential trade.  Comedian Jamie Lissow is in-studio, participating in the knock-knock joke segment and briefly discussing his career. The show concludes with a song from a Swedish pornographic film playing in the background.

The show's final segment starts with a discussion on the humane treatment of animals destined for slaughter, comparing older and modern methods.  A caller shares a knock-knock joke.  The hosts discuss "petting puppies until they die" and banter amongst themselves.  "Cape guy," a "Assault on the Media" contest winner, is mentioned, having won a MiFi.  A new contest is promoted, along with information on stopping animal cruelty.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you're stinky.  You are courtly invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Okay, terrific.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, terrific.  Open your mouth.  They're paying for it.  You'll eat it.  Do you want to kiss me?  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[00:05:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Hi.  Hi there.  Spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Good morning.  See, this proves O.P. and Anthony are failing because they've got to add another show to their channel.  They've got to add another show to High Voltage.  See, that proves that they're failing. 
[00:05:30]  Have you heard that one yet?  That's the latest one.  It is?  What happened to the one where we're going to be off the air in two months?  What happened to that one?  Hey, you're right.  Who said that?  Say.  Every time we make a move, the critics out there, see, that proves that they're failing on satellite radio.  I told you.  Yeah, we were supposed to be gone in three months.  Fucking assholes, I swear to God.  What happened?  Just shut the fuck up and realize we're great. 
[00:06:00]  We rule.  We so rule.  How do those people talk?  I love the way those people talk.  Yeah, I need a...  Let me tell you something.  Because you're failing.  Oh, and you read some of these message boards.  That's how I read them in my head, you know?  Yeah.  I just got news that they're adding a show to 202.  I told you they'd fail.  Shut up.  Fucking assholes.  I can't even remember all the things that they said was happening to us. 
[00:06:30]  This happens any time, though.  Remember when we first got to N.E.W.?  Yeah.  And they were saying we wouldn't last three months, and then I don't give them to the end of the year.  And then our ratings went through the roof, and they couldn't say anything, and that was it.  And then, like, four years later, we get fired.  Hold on.  They did say something, buddy.  They said, oh, that's a fluke.  You forgot the fluke thing?  I was going right to when we got fired, and they went, see, I told you.  See, what happened was, too many white diaries were sent into the market. 
[00:07:00]  It's a fluke.  They didn't have enough minority diaries.  Yeah.  That's why they went way up.  You watch.  It'll turn around next ratings period.  Shut up.  Just sit back and enjoy.  They suck.  Shut up and realize.  Do the voice, Jimmy.  They're failing.  Shut up and just realize that people enjoy what we do, and it's a lot different than 
[00:07:30]  what you enjoy doing.  Right.  Excuse me.  Yes.  And I'm over 30, and I love video games.  Thank you.  Yes.  Phil Mushnick, you cock.  Play them all the time.  I'm just going to have it.  It's my life.  Away from this show.  Video gaming is my life.  Phil Mushnick.  This guy writes for the New York Post, I think.  This guy is just absolutely awful.  Everything he writes is just old and curmudgeon-like.  It's horrid. 
[00:08:00]  You know what he is?  He's a douche.  He's just a douche.  He writes, do you know even five people over the age of 30 who play video games?  Yeah.  Jesus, there's probably five in this studio.  ABC did a whole story on video gaming and children.  Do we have the audio of that?  I don't know.  That's what he's commenting on.  Oh, look at poor Eric.  Hawk, I have some audio.  Let's go to Eric's head right now and look inside.  Well, as soon as you say something like that, I'm just assuming that we would do a whole 
[00:08:30]  half hour on the audio.  Yeah.  They did a little story.  I saw the panic in Eric's face.  They don't have it.  They don't have that one.  They missed that one, probably.  And then I guess somebody from the video gaming industry was saying that, hey, a lot of the  majority of the people that play or an equal number of the people that play video games  are over 30.  And Mushnick is just saying, that's impossible.  Just stop it.  And then he says, I don't know one person over the age of 30 that plays video games. 
[00:09:00]  It's you, Phil.  That's what the problem is.  Anybody that Phil Mushnick knows absolutely isn't playing video games.  They're complaining about the blacks moving into their neighborhood.  He's a fossil.  He looks like one of those guys, to me, I mean, looking, I don't know the guy, but looking  at his picture and reading his column over the years, you could kind of get what I believe  is a pretty accurate opinion of the guy.  He looks like the type of guy that knows nothing about computers, technology, video gaming, 
[00:09:30]  what it's about, what people that are over 30 are like that play it.  I picture him sitting there with an old typewriter, an old typewriter, typing out his column.  Ding.  Ding.  There it is.  Mushnick's done.  Copy, boy.  Get this to the presses.  Like an old ass. 
[00:10:00]  Knows nothing.  The papers are filled with old asses.  Old asses.  That they can't get out of these seats.  Get some young blood in there.  Get some young holes in there.  Phil, there are plenty of people over the age of 30 playing video games.  And I do believe it is probably equal to the number of people under 20 that are playing  video games.  It's just, that's, it's entertainment.  July 21st, ABC's World News Tonight included a report on an aging, ugly story that has grown 
[00:10:30]  worse.  Video games are now including even more anti-social content than before.  At the end of that segment, ABC News reported unblinkingly, and to a national audience to  stand there with their dry eyes, their eyes drying out, unblinkingly, unlicking lips.  The clockwork orange, their eyes are just wide open.  I swear to God, they're all over 30, sir! 
[00:11:00]  At the end of that segment, ABC News reported unblinkingly, and to a national audience, the  video game industries claim that the average age of those who play video games is 30 years  old.  30.  That makes perfect sense, by the way.  It really does.  You think, what, 18?  A lot of kids are playing.  18, they can afford their own games.  Yeah, there are people playing games under that.  There's people at 10, 11 years old playing a lot of video games.  But if you go for the time, like, I know I wasn't allowed, if I was a kid, I wasn't 
[00:11:30]  allowed to do anything for 16 hours straight, you know, before your mother would chase you  out of the house.  When you reach a certain age where you're independent, you live by yourself, and you  could sit in front of a video game for 16, 20 hours at a clip, you gotta be over 30.  It's gotta be close to 30.  I'm sure, you know, a lot of these numbers are padded, so maybe it's 28, you know what  I mean? 
[00:12:00]  But it's not 16 or 17, like Mr. Mushnick would like to think.  And then it goes on, and that was that.  Report over.  That was that, I say.  Report over.  Now, I'm going to go out on a very thick limb here and suggest that if the video game industry  told ABC News such a thing that the industry is lying, telling a whopper.  Yeah, Phil.  He actually writes, telling a whopper.  A whopper.  If you say, if you say a lie is telling a whopper, you know nothing about video gaming, unless 
[00:12:30]  the whopper computer running the war game scenario.  Or unless you want to know what Steve ate half of, and he's now throwing up in the parking  lot.  I told him I wanted a whopper junior.  My stomach won't take an entire whopper.  Steve's telling a whopper to the parking lot.  The industry's claim is simply impossible to believe, given that I know one person over 
[00:13:00]  the age of 30 who regularly plays video games, yet I know of scores of people under the age  of 18, children who regularly play video games.  How about you?  Do you know even five people over the age of 30 who play video games?  Yeah.  Yet, I'll bet that for every person 30 years old and over, you can find, who plays video  games, you can find 20 people under the age of 30 who play video games.  What people does he know?  Who does he know that is under 18?  Who does he even know? 
[00:13:30]  Is he talking to them, or is it the parents going, yeah, he loves his video games, and he  doesn't know anybody over 30 that plays video games, because he's one of these technology  retards.  Or is he actually hanging out with people over 30, or just hanging out with a bunch of kids  in a schoolyard?  He's a creep.  Stupid kid-toucher.  Every child I've ever fingered loves video games.  Shithead.  What a creep.  What a douche.  He's a jerk.  Let's just keep going around the room.  Oh, God. 
[00:14:00]  In the days that followed ABC's news report, almost every young adult we spoke with who  once played video games told us that they began in their pre-to-early teens, their interest  peaked in their mid-to-late teens, and quickly began to fade in their early-to-mid-twenties.  That's bullshit.  Your video gaming hunger fades in your early-to-mid-twenties.  That is bullshit.  The guy is a know-nothing clod. 
[00:14:30]  That is when you finally start getting what is called disposable income, where you can  then go out and buy some of the games that you want to play.  You've got a computer, maybe in your dorm room, whatever.  You're sitting there and playing a lot of video games.  Right.  And as you get older, you get a little more time, whatever.  You play goddamn video games.  They're fun. 
[00:15:00]  He just doesn't see the fun or entertainment value.  Or maybe he just doesn't know about them.  He's probably thinking of, yeah, I see him playing that Pac-Man and listening to Pac-Man  fever.  Oh, Pac-Man fever.  What an idiot.  He's an ass.  What a douche.  Bill Mushnick is a boob.  Buffoon. 
[00:15:30]  What a minister of morons.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to call Bravo Sierra on Mr. Mushnick.  Yes.  That ABC News could so matter-of-factly repeat a claim that defies common sense and nationwide  empirical logic is mind-blowing.  You know, Ma.  Here's a quote.  So he's like making believe he's talking to his mom. 
[00:16:00]  Ma.  You know, Ma.  Those 30- to 40-year-olds who just went to the basement to play video games sure look a tad  younger, like maybe 13 or 14.  And I can't recall 30-year-olds having to be dropped off by their mothers.  What an unfunny ass.  A complete jackass.  He does.  And listen to the way he words it. 
[00:16:30]  Down in the basement.  Like the computers are all down in the basement still.  It's back in the older days.  You hide that thing.  Stop.  He's a creep.  I bet you this guy loves giving rusty trombones.  He sure does.  To someone who's very young and crying.  I just want to get picked up by my parents.  Where are the video games, Mr. Mushnick?  By the way.  In the basement.  Yay!  By the way, without even trying, we have a 35-year-old, a 48-year-old, a 32-year-old, 
[00:17:00]  a 31-year-old, 37-year-old, and a 42-year-old all on hold waiting to talk to us.  What a dick.  Just a complete fool.  The video industry, it seems, rather than admit that it's partially in the business of  selling violence and sex to the young, would have us, through ABC News, believe that it  is a somewhat unusual day when kids play video games.  Swallowing and reporting such nonsense, incidentally, is how Vince McMahon, he hates Vince McMahon. 
[00:17:30]  Hates Vince McMahon.  Why?  Can't stand Vince McMahon, can't stand how he, you know...  Because Vince is a genius, who's a successful guy, who's a genius at marketing, and Phil's  a jack-off that writes for the New York Post.  One of the worst newspapers ever.  It is a tabloid.  It's like weekly world news.  It's great toilet reading.  It is, and Phil works there. 
[00:18:00]  You know he hates the fact that he's working for the...  He bashes sex and violence in video games, yet his column is usually near an ad for some  type of sex, some type of apparatus in the post.  It's just the way it is.  And he hates that.  Swallowing and reporting such nonsense, incidentally, is how Vince McMahon would defend his pro-wrestling 
[00:18:30]  empire as he turned it into primetime borderline porn.  Borderline porn.  Are you insane?  Borderline porn?  Uh-huh.  That's a hell of a statement, Mr. Mushnick.  Uh, what is borderline porn, by the way?  Hmm.  Nothing.  No one's got anything on my borderline porn.  McMahon would claim that his TV shows are no longer for kids, and darn if newscasts, local  and national, didn't dispatch reporters to stand there and blankly nod as McMahon said 
[00:19:00]  such things.  Blankly nod.  It's kind of funny, actually.  But all these reporters had to do was look around.  If it's not for kids, why are the live audiences at his shows loaded with kids?  Why is TV advertising children enjoying candy bars aimed at kids?  Why are the shelves at Toys R Us loaded with McMahon's pro-wrestling merchandise?  These are not aberrations.  Beyond belief, stupidity has become epidemic within newscasts. 
[00:19:30]  Last month, shortly after the terrorist bombings of London Subway, CNN's headline news for at  least an hour repeatedly posted the following graphic.  Yeah.  Attack on London.  37 dead.  700 plus wounded.  Is the U.S. safe from a similar attack?  Well, let's see now.  Seeing how the U.S. got it far worse on 9-11 and seeing how we wouldn't be safe from a  similar attack even if we'd never been attacked, we're going to take a wild guess and answer  no.  The U.S. is not safe from a similar attack.  Good grief. 
[00:20:00]  He went off.  What is he even talking about?  He kind of attacked the integrity of what CNN was saying, which he's right about, but  it's like, look who you write for.  Yeah.  Stop.  You don't exactly write for the New York Times.  No.  It's the Post, Phil.  No matter what you say, you write for the New York Post.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, the front page of the New York Post today, the paper he writes for?  Yeah.  Catholic school sex scandal.  Yeah.  Another teacher banging students. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, let's look at the headlines.  Newsday says it's all about Iraq, London bomb suspect.  The Daily News has Big Rat, Diary of John Gotti's wife.  Which is some unbelievable reading, by the way.  It started yesterday in the Daily News.  And the New York Post, big block letters, sex teach.  Sex teach.  There, Phil, there's your paper.  There's your borderline pornography.  You think people are picking up the post to read sex teach to get all the info on that  story? 
[00:21:00]  Or maybe just to get a little titillated.  I think that headline reeks of titillation.  Where's your morals, Mr. Mushnik?  Yeah, why don't you resign from the New York Post and try to find a more reputable paper?  Mr. Mushnik.  Mushnik.  The name alone.  And this coming from Cumia.  Mushnik.  Stop it.  So there you have it.  It's an all-out assault on video games.  Boy, that Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is just getting fucked. 
[00:21:30]  You can't find it anywhere now.  Forget it.  I know.  It sold a lot, though, before.  It did.  Before they took it off the shelves, right?  But now none of the stores are carrying it.  A lot of these online places that you could order it, gone.  And this is the government's way of censoring video games.  They can't censor it.  You can't just go and say, take it off the market, we're censoring it.  But they could put the rating system in place, and then they could squawk that the rating  isn't high enough, get it an adults-only rating, and then have the stores not carry it 
[00:22:00]  under fear of a boycott.  But so, in essence, you're removing this from the populace.  And who's going to honor?  This is why I hate the retail stores, too.  Who's going to honor a boycott?  If they had an adult-only section for video games and said, you have to be 18 or older  to purchase these games.  All right, that's fine.  Why is that a problem?  Why can't a store carry that?  Because we are image.  We don't even want it within our four walls.  And, in essence, they rid the world of these games. 
[00:22:30]  You're not going to be able to make a game like San Andreas with all the fun content that  people over 30 that play the games find entertaining.  It's a little adult-oriented.  We don't want SpongeBob SquarePants running around on our video screens.  You're not going to find them.  They cost a lot of money to make these games.  It's a fortune to make these.  They've got to recoup.  They're not going to recoup selling them in back rooms somewhere.  They've got to be out there so people can see them in all the major stores. 
[00:23:00]  So, you've seen an end to these games.  That's it.  Goodbye.  I was at my nephew's seventh birthday party over the weekend.  Aw.  Happy birthday, JD.  Did you get lucky?  Have you seen these new video games where you just plug it into anyone's TV?  Oh, yeah.  They're very small.  It's like, well, he was playing Ms. Pac-Man, believe it or not.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  And, basically, it's a console.  And, you plug it right in.  You can plug it into anyone's TV.  Yeah, you just plug it in and play the game. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, take it right with you.  Where did that start?  A couple of, about a year.  Like, you don't need a gaming console.  It's all within the unit.  You only get one game.  Yeah, it's one game.  It's got the controls on it.  The games and the controls are all in one little handy little box that you hold on to.  Right.  And the thing goes into the TV.  And you play it.  He's seven, just, you know, plugging it into the TV.  And that used to take a huge console and cartridges.  And then he just starts playing Ms. Pac-Man.  Then unplugs it, turns the TV back on so we can watch whatever we were watching. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  He had a couple games like that.  What a great idea.  It was a cool one.  I haven't played it in a while, but I want to get some more cartridges for it.  Intellivision.  I used to love the Intellivision racing game.  Phil Mushnick likes Intellivision.  That's his idea of what family entertainment would be.  It would just be like a little ball that bounces and you have to click on the red one.  That's fun.  Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, pong.  That's it.  Mushnick.  I play pong. 
[00:24:30]  Indeed you do, Mr. Mushnick.  What a buffoon.  I thought you also enjoy a dirty Sanchez, don't you?  Sitting nude with just an awful smoking jacket, typing up his boring column.  They call him a butterscotch columnist.  Let's say hi to Randy in New York, 48 years old.  What's up, Randy?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hi, Daddy.  Hi there.  Listen, I'm 48 years old.  I've been playing video games since the consoles first came out. 
[00:25:00]  The old Nintendo crap.  Right up to the computer games and stuff.  I even got land throughout my house to play with the consoles and the computer.  This fucking shit dick don't know what the hell he's talking about.  As far as I'm concerned, does he have any kids?  I don't think so.  If not, why is he downplaying these video games and stuff?  You know, it's up to the adults like myself and stuff.  You know, let the kids play what they want to play.  But other than that, you know, fuck him.  I don't know if he has kids or if it's only certain states will allow he and his partner to adopt. 
[00:25:30]  Why can't you just have the rating system the way it is and put it in the stores  and let the parents understand what their kids are bringing home?  It's plainly marked on the box.  You could see what they're playing.  Look over your kid's shoulder for a few minutes and see what games they're playing.  And if you don't like what they're playing, if it's not appropriate for them, take it away from them.  That's why I hate the religious right.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[00:26:00]  You should.  They're disgraceful.  So I would like to see the stories tell out, though.  The stories buckling like this is really sickening.  Yeah.  Really is.  It's sad.  Brian in South Carolina.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, Jimmy.  I saw you in Cleveland.  Good show on a late one there.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Hey, this guy, this guy's soft, Dick.  He needs to take his typewriter and strap it on his chest and douse it in gas and put one firecracker on the asshole key.  Wow.  Anyway.  That was a long...  No, no.  Terrific.  Not anyway.  You don't get out of that with an anyway, my friend. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  You don't clear your throat and forge right ahead.  I'm ready to...  Mike in New York.  Hey, what's going on?  Stop floundering yutz.  All right.  He don't strap it to his head.  Think quickly.  Think quickly.  Think quickly.  Think quickly.  Hi, Brian.  Put a flammable liquid on his chest and set a fire, which he gets from a tree.  Anyway.  Moving right along.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph. 
[00:27:00]  Semi-colon.  Hey, we didn't get a harumph out of you.  Harumph.  There you go.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  Hey, my dad's like 67 years old.  He's been playing video games since Pong came out.  He bought like every console since Pong.  You know, all he does is play video games.  He plays Doom for like three hours a day.  All right.  Well, this bit's going.  We've taken it to that third level, Opie.  Thank you, Elo, for that suggestion to take it to the third level. 
[00:27:30]  Jesus.  We can handle this one on our own on level one.  GTA San Andreas on eBay.  $95.  Is that what's happening now?  They're starting to sell the unscented.  That's what they did.  They pretty much made it a collector's item.  Yeah.  Even though there are plenty out there.  All right.  I don't understand why the stores won't carry it.  It just makes me want to spit on them.  Stores like Walmart and Target.  You know what they cater to?  They cater to what they call the soccer moms. 
[00:28:00]  Soccer moms.  And they don't want that in there.  Not that they'd even notice, but it would start making the news.  The press picks up on it.  Why are they selling pornography at Target?  And they get it out of there.  And, you know, Michael Moore is much unalike.  And what a great thing he raised about how they sell guns in these stores.  And there's just so many other things they won't sell.  But you can buy a rifle, but you can't buy this.  It's just, what's a better thing to have with this than a rifle?  If you get a few ideas, you go out and shoot a hooker. 
[00:28:30]  Of course.  Say hi to Tony in Philly.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Jimmy.  Hi, Tony.  I did the assault on the media that you guys talked about Friday.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I called it late on the replay, and I figured I'd give you guys a call and tell you the whole story about it.  Yeah, Tony in Philly, you scared the crap out of that reporter.  Let me play the audio.  The video's up on opianthony.com.  So people can check out the video, which is priceless. 
[00:29:00]  It really is.  This one made us laugh really hard.  Here's the audio before you explain what happened.  Well, Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many turns.  And what we've learned tonight is that the sign welcoming.  What a mess.  She stopped talking, and they went right to the tape piece.  Well, I actually called.  Remember, I called about three weeks ago.  I tried to do that one down on Channel 10 where I held up the signs. 
[00:29:30]  I taped them to the window, and you couldn't see them.  Yeah, I remember.  Oh, that was awful.  Yeah, a lot of people laughed openly at you.  I had a lot of that one failed.  And then I did this one, but I actually got.  That's Channel 3, and I actually got Channel 6 right after that.  But I have it on my TiVo.  I can't copy it to tape.  Hey, dude, I got a question for you before you start.  About this one that you just did with the reporter.  You were with another guy.  What was the first opianthony we heard in the background?  Were you guys warming up, or did you plan on doing it from there?  No, I'm the guy with the glasses.  The guy in the blue was just some drunk guy. 
[00:30:00]  That was his girlfriend, because I was telling him about it.  And she goes, Opie and Anthony.  And that's how you can hear it.  Oh, it's her just saying Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, that was it.  But then right after I got her, I saw the other guy from Channel 6.  He looks at me.  He was going to do a live feed right in front of the restaurant.  He swings the whole camera in front of his van, so the back of him is the van.  And I run up behind him.  You can see my face in the window of the van, yelling Opie and Anthony and being a pest to him, too. 
[00:30:30]  He made us laugh all weekend long there, Tony.  It was a very, very good assault on the media.  She came after me.  She came after me.  I'm walking away, and she comes after me.  She's like, is that you?  How old are you?  Well, these reporters, they take their jobs very seriously.  But after they get assaulted, you know, they have nothing really to come at you with.  Nothing.  They're just so mad inside, and they don't know what to do. 
[00:31:00]  I love that.  Absolutely love that.  Well, Tony, did you have the best assault on the media for the month of July?  It is now August.  I did.  I thought it was pretty good.  I didn't think I would be a winner, but I hope I am.  I looked at the other guys, but mine, I think, was pretty good.  Well, we're going to announce the winner of the assault on the media contest in a little while here.  And then we're going to start up the contest for the month of August.  But I just wanted to give you guys a call and just let you know the whole story. 
[00:31:30]  Good job.  Thank you, Tony.  That was a great job.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Nice to see you, man.  Made us laugh all weekend long.  You can see the video on opianthony.com.  We had a couple of new ones, I guess?  Uh, yeah.  Buffalo Paul tried again, and some guy just kind of walked by with a wow sticker, which  was pretty funny.  Poor Buffalo Paul.  The best part about these assaults on the media is the graphics that someone are enhancing  the video.  Yeah.  And this guy walks by with a wow sticker, and I thought it was really nice.  And then someone writes on the screen, why don't you slow down just a little bit, a little 
[00:32:00]  too fast.  Why is it?  I don't know.  Can you get that one up or no?  So, and then, yeah, then Buffalo Paul, he did another one where he, uh, it was very  interesting, though.  He had his own handheld camera.  Yeah.  So, while he's assaulting the media on live TV, which you could see, then he plays the  video of what he was seeing, which is the cameraman.  Hey, that's a good idea.  Yes.  So, is it good enough to win the assault on the media contest for the month of July? 
[00:32:30]  You'll have to wait and see.  I haven't seen that one yet.  It's pretty good, actually.  They're up on Foundry?  Uh, yeah, they're up all over the place, opianthony.com, foundrymusic.com.  Good luck finding it.  Which is F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  He's all mad somewhere.  It's very easily navigate.  Yeah, you have to put in a few underscores to find zero results.  Your search put in zero results for Opie and Anthony.  I just hate the fact that you click on a link, and you've got to go through, like, five more  pop-up pages with links that are mysteriously hidden to find the content. 
[00:33:00]  Watch.  This is the one.  Turn it to Anthony.  That's the one with the guy walking by?  Yeah, this was on Long Island.  Reporters reporting at some kind of festival.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, the guy couldn't commit.  That was it?  The guy could not commit.  He should have said something or gotten it.  He was scared.  He was scared.  Well, some of the guys get scared when it's time to perform.  But you can see the latest assaults on the media on opianthony.com. 
[00:33:30]  I want to see the Paul one.  Foundry music.com.  Yeah, here's the Paul one before we go to break.  Got to take a quick break, because I got to take a leak.  And then we'll talk about Anthony's weekend in Atlantic City.  Oh, yeah.  And Jim Norton and his Saturn update and his Dell update.  Jimmy's a customer service madman over the weekend.  Also, Jimmy called me while he was drugged up after his procedure.  I got the phone call.  They give you good drugs, right?  I forget what it was called.  It was actually an anesthesia that doesn't make you nauseous. 
[00:34:00]  Profol or Propofol.  I want to say Propofol.  Somebody out there would know, but it was actually really good, because I was afraid  of being sick.  Here it is.  It was Dopa.  Here's the Buffalo Paul one.  All right.  I know.  This is radio.  Some guy yapping by the fence.  Anthony's watching the video for the first time here.  An establishing shot.  Yeah, they're just showing a building.  Who cares?  A montage of a...  Another building in Buffalo that they should just destroy. 
[00:34:30]  That's him with his hand held, obviously.  There he is.  Wow.  He's got a chicken head.  And that was pretty good.  All right, Buffalo Paul.  That's not bad.  He had a chicken head on?  And that's what he was looking at.  That's what he saw?  Yeah.  Wow.  Buffalo Paul's an animal.  And then the reporter said something.  What did the reporter say to him after the shot?  I forget now.  Hawk?  Anyone?  Hawk?  Bosses are talking to you.  No one knows.  How about waking up?  No one knows.  No one knows what anyone said.  No one knows. 
[00:35:00]  No one cares, Paul.  Buffalo Paul.  No one cares about you.  Barry fucking Godmother said it.  But he comes into the shot with his own video camera so he can film the whole thing.  That's good.  Film the cameraman filming him on live TV.  And then he has like some kind of chicken hat on.  What is that?  Take a close look.  What is it?  It's some kind of chicken.  A chicken on his head?  It's a chicken head hat.  Then he's got one of the huge opiate Anthony.  What adult.  And Mushnick thinks that people over 30 don't play video games? 
[00:35:30]  Look what we have adults doing.  Acting like morons.  Ah, too good.  That's great.  No, that's a good one.  So we'll announce the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest for the month of July in a few minutes here.  Huge sign right up behind the reporter.  Great job.  It's funny.  Got all the features, wackiness and the pest cam.  Did Buffalo Paul pull it out at the last moment?  Did he?  Maybe.  You never know.  And also, Anthony, we hand out our first golden ticket today. 
[00:36:00]  What are we, Willy Wonka?  We're handing out our first golden ticket today.  Our first golden ticket.  Here's the deal for regular, boring, commercial radio.  Your pals, Opie and Anthony and old Jimmy Norton, we're going to save five of you.  We're like Willy Wonka.  We're going to save five radio shows from that awful commercial radio.  And the rest of you could just go to hell as we destroy you.  Just rot in the wasteland that is broadcast radio. 
[00:36:30]  Just rot in your 30-minute commercial breaks.  Be no part of the future of radio.  Just rot playing the same 20 songs in a row.  Not being able to speak your mind.  Just rot making believe you're edgy, but you're really not.  Fearing for your career after every show because you might have said go to hell or some other FCC violation.  The beauty of this is we came up with something a long time ago. 
[00:37:00]  Basically, it is Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  And we've been paying close attention ever since we had our little fuck-up, fuckos.  Our little problem.  A little misstep.  Remember when we fucked up, fuckos?  Hey, fucko.  Well, we've been...  I knew that fuck...  I forgot the voice already.  God damn it.  I knew they'd do that.  What was the voice?  You can't remember the voice.  Opie, what's the dopey voice?  Now it's more of a radio voice, you know. 
[00:37:30]  Everyone knew that these guys just weren't talented enough for commercial radio.  It was just a matter of time before they were going to take it too far.  Shut up, fucko.  They're not going to last for three days.  These guys are not going to last.  This proves that they're failing on Bond 202.  Opie gets a nasal tone going.  And he makes this kind of face, but I still can't do it. 
[00:38:00]  Jimmy contorts his face.  I can capture the essence of who that man is, but I can't get the voice.  You make a creature from a Black Lagoon face when you do that voice.  I just want to talk radio and bite Adrian Barbeau's tits.  So here's the deal.  We've been paying...  Here's the deal.  We've been paying close attention to all you fuckos out there.  And we know who talked bad about us when we had our little misstep. 
[00:38:30]  And guess what?  We have a lot of power now.  And we're going to save five of you from commercial radio.  Yeah.  Will it be Lex and Terry?  I don't think so.  I doubt it.  I don't think so.  Will it be the Greaseman, Anthony?  Bone dry.  What a doodle.  I'm looking for a golden ticket.  Won't be getting one, but I'm looking.  Taking the mail every day.  Nothing today.  Mr. Greaseman, you will not be slinging lead with satellite radio. 
[00:39:00]  Let me check my email.  Perhaps Opie and Anthony have emailed me my golden ticket.  What's in here?  Viagra.  Mortgages.  Oh, I've won $20 million from Zimbabwe.  What did he do?  Maybe he's on page two.  Nothing.  Where's my O and A golden ticket? 
[00:39:30]  Don't make me start pulling out my gun and slinging lead.  I'll get attention.  I want to be on XM satellite radio.  Golden ticket.  Let's see here.  If I send my bank account number, I can get $20 million U.S. cashola.  Cashola.  You can buy a lot of bone dries with that kind of bread.  What a complete fucko. 
[00:40:00]  That sounds exactly like you.  Oh, he will not be coming on board.  Permission to come aboard, sir.  Oh, denied.  I'm a buffoon.  We have two lists.  We have two lists.  The list of potential shows that we're going to bring with us.  Right.  To this wonderful new medium.  And then we have the list of fuckos.  Fucko.  Who's on the fucko list?  So far we've got Lexan Turi, the Greaseman. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  That's not long.  That's not long, is it?  Mr. Phillips.  Right.  Of course, Mr. Phillips.  That jackass.  Little update, by the way.  We were never sued.  Stop.  We never got to.  Who said that?  And in what voice did they say it?  You guys are going to get sued.  I know why.  That stopped.  You got sued. 
[00:41:00]  And Shannon Burke.  Oh.  Remember that gentleman?  Yeah, he's out.  Sorry, Shannon.  That's right.  You're on the fucko list.  That's right.  Congratulations, mister.  We're making two lists.  The list of fuckos.  And the golden ticket winners.  Man Cow on the list of fuckos.  Have fun.  Have fun in commercial radio hell.  Wallow in that wasteland.  Good day, sir.  You get nothing.  You lose. 
[00:41:30]  Todd Schmidt?  I don't know.  I think he's on the fence.  Which one is Todd Schmidt?  He's not on the fence.  Of course he's not.  Good day to you, Mr. Schmidt.  You are fooling us.  Of course, Donna Mike, are on the list of fuckos.  Fuckos.  Goodbye.  He's jotting all these things down.  He's actually writing them down.  He's actually writing them down.  That's right.  On the fence list would be monsters or on the fence list.  Monsters in the morning? 
[00:42:00]  Monsters in the evening?  Where are they now?  Morning.  Middays?  Morning?  Monsters at dusk.  Monsters.  Let me think.  Anything?  All right.  I'll put them in the gray area just for now.  Gray.  Please put me in the gray area.  That's the funniest thing.  Grease man.  Looking for his golden ticket.  Golden ticket, dear.  Maybe it's in my other email account.  Oh, nothing.  Our friends in Dallas?  Oh, Pugs and Kelly? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, of course.  I think they're tied up, but...  Yeah, we'll put them on the list of potential.  Pugs and Kelly, sure.  We'll keep them over here for now.  There you go.  This is what we do now.  It's what we do now.  We got five golden tickets and we gave one away.  Now there's four.  Am I right or wrong?  Four to go.  Right or wrong?  Right or wrong?  After you give another one away, there's going to be three.  Shall I keep going?  Maybe we should get down to lunch. 
[00:43:00]  All you guys in commercial radio that just laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed when we got fired.  Oh, you had a lot to say, didn't you?  They certainly did.  All you brave fuckos.  Waiting for Anthony and I to be silenced, then you had a lot to say, didn't you?  They're going to be blackballed.  Oh, Opie and Anthony, they'll never work again.  Jimmy makes the face when Opie does it.  Their radio careers are pretty much over unless they want a star in the middle of fucking nowhere. 
[00:43:30]  Well, fuckos.  That's right.  Tom Likas, are you insane?  Oh, God.  Get your pen.  He's at the top of the list of fuckos.  Come on.  Do you have a list of guys who talk like that?  Come on.  Tom Likas is on the list of fuckos.  Merry Christmas to my ex-wife.  I'm going to throw her in the fireplace.  One of the greatest stories ever.  There was some rumor. 
[00:44:00]  Rumor had it, but it was backed up by a few people.  They called up and said that during one Christmas party, he got in a fight with his wife.  Yeah, it was backed up with a police report.  A police report and headlines in the Boston paper.  Yeah.  We read the news story.  He had a fight with his wife at a Christmas party, and when they got home, the fight continued,  and he threw her into a fireplace.  Threw her.  Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, and so is this whore I married. 
[00:44:30]  Come on.  By the way.  I thought she was a U-log.  By the way, guys, well, yeah, you know what?  If you work at O-Town, you're on the list of fuckos.  Anyone in O-Town, you will not be receiving a golden ticket.  From your pals Opie and Anthony.  Perhaps a golden shower from your mo' friends.  Awful humans in tough old O-Town.  The regular guys in Jersey that have been pretty much doing our show since we got fired, you're 
[00:45:00]  on the list of fuckos.  Tell them, Fred.  The regular guys.  Regular guys.  Just regular guys.  Yes.  I like them a lot at, let's see, what time do I enjoy them?  18 after, and 33 and 48.  I like to listen to Jeff McKay do traffic, who also does it on 1010 Winds. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  You know Jeff McKay, don't you?  Of course.  That fucker does traffic like nobody's business.  I'm not gay or anything, but I want to hold Jeff McKay while he does traffic.  You just want to hold him?  He's so good at it.  Rub his head?  Yeah.  His chest.  Put some Vicks vapor up on his chest so he can breathe okay.  Do we have a drum roll?  We have given out our first golden ticket.  Our first golden ticket.  The first show we're saving from commercial radio hell. 
[00:46:00]  Here to our studios.  Somebody out there, call the presses.  We want to have a press conference and announce that we're saving five of these shows from lousy  commercial radio.  Yeah.  And that we have a list of fuckos.  Yeah.  We got one person on the golden ticket list.  One show on the golden ticket list and fuckos.  Tell the media.  This is what we do.  We have five golden tickets.  And I think we're going to save one golden ticket for our fine listeners. 
[00:46:30]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I think we're going to give them a show.  We haven't figured it out yet, but I think we're going to give them a show.  Where?  Just on the weekend.  Give them an hour or two.  What are you saying?  They send stuff in, and then we put it together and intro it and stuff.  Yeah.  I'm dead serious.  And play it.  And play it.  They're not sitting in here.  God forbid.  It could be a lot of the stuff that they've already sent into the show, but we focus on  a nice hour or two hours a week. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  We'll figure it out.  Giving them full credit, the whole deal.  All right.  Hit that drum roll.  Jesus.  Did you lose your stick?  It took a while.  It's a drum roll.  What am I?  Drum roll.  Why is the grease man still standing?  Sit down, fucko.  Let me see.  Cheap mortgage. 
[00:47:30]  Ooh, R-E, your email.  Perhaps this is the golden ticket.  Let me click on this.  Hot teen sex.  No, that's not it.  And I don't remember sending an email to her.  I think I've been bamboozled.  Bone dry.  Ooh, a friendly note from Bridget Jennings.  Let me click.  Dear subscriber, want more sleep?  New items each day. 
[00:48:00]  It's not a golden ticket.  Three.  R-E account number.  There's one for you.  Perhaps this is the golden ticket.  Let me...  Horny housewives in your area.  Mature, beautiful, and sexy milfs.  Where's my ticket, boys?  All right.  We got some audio here.  Listen to this.  Part of the release thing is that we can't tell you where we're going, but from what I understand, 
[00:48:30]  it is the worst kept secret in radio.  That's what I keep hearing over and over again.  Yeah.  Who are those guys?  Aren't they on the fuck-o list?  I'll say.  This is the audio of the first show we're saving from commercial radio.  Right.  Yeah, I know.  The one guy sounds a little gay.  You'll get used to it, though.  Who?  Don't talk about Ronnie like that.  This is the audio of Ron and Fez and pretty much the last few things they said on their 
[00:49:00]  commercial radio show.  Yep.  They will be joining us on XM Satellite Radio.  Absolutely.  Is it amazing they couldn't say where they were going?  Well, that's what I want to get at here.  That's the fear also.  They were allowed to say they were leaving the last 15 minutes of their show.  They couldn't say before that.  They couldn't say before that.  But the last 15 minutes of their show, this is the company we used to work for.  Ugh. 
[00:49:30]  And the last 15 minutes they were allowed to say they were leaving so they could say goodbye  to everyone, but they couldn't tell them where they were going.  No.  So this is what they kind of said.  Part of the release thing is that we can't tell you where we're going, but from what I  understand, it is the worst kept secret in radio.  That's what I keep hearing over and over again.  Yeah.  So see, that's how they had to do their announcement.  Yeah.  They couldn't say they were going to XM Satellite Radio, Ron and Fez.  They were leaving.  And then they did this.  And we can't play our I Shall Be Released anymore. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  We'll try to find a new song, Fez, as an ending song.  So we'll start it off this way.  Satellite's gone up to the sky.  Putting the band back together.  So they played that as a little hint.  Nice.  A little hint of where they were going.  But let me ask you, if Satellite is such a non-threat, why would commercial radio care  that they're leaving to go to some obscure, awful place?  Why would that bother them unless they see this as obviously a real viable threat to their 
[00:50:30]  interests?  I don't get it.  Because, yeah, exactly.  They do know it is a threat.  And we were announcing for a long time that we were going to try to get the band back together.  And Ron and Fez are dear friends of ours.  We had a really good time when we were doing commercial radio at WNEW.  A very, very talented bunch of guys.  Right.  And they do a, you know, a different show than we do, which is kind of cool, too.  And then I guess this was their final words on their commercial radio show. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  So take care, everybody.  We'll see you again.  Thank you to everybody at WJFK.  God bless you all.  Thank you very, very much.  And just one more thing.  And this time, it's a shoot.  It's real.  You better believe it.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  That's right.  That's right.  Well, they fucked it up because your final words on the radio should be your mom's box.  Your mom's box. 
[00:51:30]  We started that tradition many years ago when one of our guys, Psycho Mark.  That was Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark was getting fired because he allowed a couple to have anal sex on the boss's couch.  With one of the bosses watching, telling him not to do it.  Telling him if he continued letting that couple have sex on the boss's couch, anal sex,  that he would be fired.  On his fine Italian leather sofa.  And he continued doing it.  Chiz flying everywhere.  Oh, God.  As the boss, you know, looked on. 
[00:52:00]  Looked through the locked glass door in horror.  Powerless to do anything.  Looking through at the couple having anal sex.  Not even regular sex.  With Psycho Mark just cackling.  If you think Ben cackles, Psycho Mark taught him how to cackle.  Right.  That guy.  The best part, the lawyers had to fire Psycho Mark, and this was part of our Sex for Sam  contest.  Yep.  And then eventually we would do another Sex for Sam contest, and Anthony and I would  get fired and everyone else. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And it was funny, through that whole process, the lawyers trying to claim that they never  approved the contest.  And I had to point out to them when we had one of those big meetings, you know, after  the fact.  And I'm like, weren't it you guys that kind of fired Psycho Mark for being part of the  Sex for Sam contest?  Yeah.  You idiots.  There was a point value for the boss's office.  Right.  And Psycho Mark was going for the quick points right there in the building.  Mm-hmm.  He took his couple in there, and they had anal on the boss's couch. 
[00:53:00]  That's right.  And we knew he was fired.  He was getting fired.  Had him come in and ask what he wants his last words on the air to be.  Like, and he just blurted out, your mom's box!  It was kind of sad, because we were broadcasting live from the Sam Adams Brewery.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It was by phone, right?  Yeah.  So he was on phone, and it was his last words.  It was almost like, I don't know, like he was stuck on the top of Mount Everest, but he  happened to have a cell phone. 
[00:53:30]  But you knew he just wasn't going to make it.  I read this in a book, by the way.  This is not original.  A book?  And the guy, like, he knew he wasn't going to make it.  Yeah.  So he was able to call down, and actually they patched him into his wife back in the  States, I guess.  Yeah.  And he actually got to say goodbye to his wife, knowing that he was just going to freeze  to death on the top of Mount Everest.  Do you think she nagged him a little bit on that call?  Well, what am I supposed to do now?  What was that?  I think that was the book, Into Thin Air?  Yeah.  The guy was stuck on Everest. 
[00:54:00]  What an amazing, amazing book.  And he had to, like, talk to his wife, knowing that he was going to die.  And I kind of remember when Psycho Mark was doing that, I felt like he was just out there  helpless, because we were nowhere near him at that point.  And he, yeah, we asked him, what's your final words?  And he said, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  And we've been doing that ever since.  And a sherpa actually got to that guy, but just couldn't get him to come down.  He was too frozen and screwed up.  Really?  He was still kicking?  Yeah, yeah, he was alive.  And that's what he actually brought on the phone, if I remember. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Talk radio personalities Ron and Fez to join XM Satellite Radio.  Here's the press release from the gang in Washington.  XM Satellite Radio, the nation's leading satellite radio service, with more than 4.4 million subscribers,  today announced that Washington, D.C.  talk radio personalities Ron and Fez will bring their popular daily radio show.  And irreverent humor to XM Satellite Radio.  Beginning, here's the details, because I didn't really have them in front of me. 
[00:55:00]  Beginning September 12th, Ron and Fez will broadcast weekdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Mm-hmm.  Eastern time.  Eastern time, exclusively on high voltage, with encores airing from 7 to 10.  No, that's not right.  No, that's not right.  Oh, my God.  That's a problem.  I just want to work with people that could get the facts right.  That's not right.  Well, then we'll figure it out. 
[00:55:30]  That's not right, because 7 to 10 would make it 4 to 7 on the East Coast.  That's not right.  Oh, these idiots.  These idiots.  This is exactly not what we discussed.  I circled that.  I was like, oh.  Yeah.  That's, that's, this is not right.  Unless you guys.  This isn't right.  We know when they're going to have replays.  Did I do it right? 
[00:56:00]  Wait, or is it right?  7 to 10, 4.  No, see, because they want us an afternoon drive on the East Coast and the West Coast,  so that's not right, right?  I don't know.  It says with encores airing from 7 to 10 p.m. Eastern time and 2 to 5 a.m. Eastern time,  right?  They screwed up one of the encores in the press release.  Because 7 to 10 Eastern time would mean 4 to 7 on the West Coast.  Right.  Which goes against exactly what they told us was going to happen, so that's got to be wrong. 
[00:56:30]  They get things wrong.  Prior to the start of their new XM show, Ron and Fez will join long-time friends and XM  talk personalities Opie and Anthony on their show Tuesday, August 9th from 7 to 11 a.m. Eastern time.  Yeah, we're going to do what's called an Afro show with the boys.  Right.  It should come as no surprise that Ron and Fez are making the jump to XM,  where they will have the opportunity to create the kind of radio that has made them popular  with their long-time fans and expand their fan base to millions of XM listeners,  said Executive Vice President of Programming for XM, Eric Logan. 
[00:57:00]  Ron and Fez are two of the funniest guys on the radio,  and XM's high voltage is a perfect place for them to do what they do best.  The duo, Ron Bennington and Fez Watley, have built a dedicated following since their start in Florida  during the mid-90s, including successful runs in New York and Washington, D.C. markets.  That's right, but I don't think that replay is right.  Ah, we'll talk to Elo later.  All right.  Elo.  E-hole, the master. 
[00:57:30]  E-hole.  That's not E-hole.  So there you have it, boys and girls.  The first golden ticket has been handed out.  Congratulations to Ron and Fez as they join the wonderful world of satellite radio.  And the rest of you fuckos, good luck to you.  Good luck.  Commercial radio.  Have fun.  You're not on the other list of potentials. 
[00:58:00]  Scott Farrell, yes, he's on the potential list.  All right.  We should take our first break and then get into Anthony's weekend in Atlantic City.  Oh, my weekend with friends that decided to drop in.  Jesus Christ.  And also, we'll talk about Jim Norton's weekend, too.  I got his voicemail that he left for me.  My procedure.  Your procedure.  Procedure.  And, oh, we'll announce the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest for the month of July.  And then we'll kick up the contest for August, okay? 
[00:58:30]  And we'll continue to roast in here.  Are you warm?  It's pretty warm in here today.  I'm actually comfy.  You are.  What about you, Ope?  I'm really hot.  Yeah.  I'll say.  And E-Rock is, like, sweating over there.  He just doesn't even acknowledge.  He doesn't sweat.  That's not sweat.  That's just some of the mayonnaise trying to leave his body.  The glaze of mayo on him.  It's not from the heat. 
[00:59:00]  It's that he's going to hit the wrong button, and Ope's going to give him a good scolding.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  All right.  We'll step aside.  We'll continue.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O-A-Day virus.  All right.  We're going to lose Bill Burr soon, so let's get back into this.  We've got one more here from Peter from In Flames.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bill Burr, Opey and Anthony's show.  You know that because you're listening to this shit.  I'm with the bass player from In Flames, Peter Iwers. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, how was your set today, man?  It's going to be fine.  We haven't played yet.  We haven't played yet?  All right.  We need to start that again, so I don't look like I know.  Here I go.  No, fuck it.  Just keep going, man.  I'm like a retarded...  I got no reference there.  So how do you think your set's going to go tonight?  You looking forward to it?  Are you on the main stage?  Yeah.  Are you over there?  I think it's going to go great.  I mean, we always put in 150% and, you know, it's a bit different playing from a sitting  down crowd, but still, it's going to be great. 
[01:00:00]  So far, all the shows have been amazing, so I'm pretty sure today will be as well.  Do you guys like your vibe?  You're more mellow, melodic?  Is that like how you guys are?  I think we're mellow.  You know, it's hard to categorize us into one phase, basically.  Okay.  All right.  So you're not like Iron Maiden meets, you know, like piss movies and stuff.  You're like Iron Maiden meets...  I guess we could say that, but it would be unfair, probably, to just categorize it into  one, you know.  I don't like that.  We're metal batters.  All right.  That's cool, man. 
[01:00:30]  That's cool.  How long have you guys been playing?  A long time now, since...  I think it's like 12 years, something.  Like 12 years?  Out of everybody in the band, if you had to kill someone, who would you kill?  Myself.  You kill yourself?  The road's starting to get to you?  No, no.  But, I mean, it wouldn't be fair to the others, otherwise.  Choose one.  Oh, God.  I just...  No one would go with this.  No one wants to commit.  It wouldn't be fair to the others.  Ugh.  Wouldn't be fair to the others, otherwise.  Choose one. 
[01:01:00]  I like this guy.  This guy, I can tell you're like the peacekeeper in the band, right?  You're like the mellow one.  Listen, man.  We're also doing, this is kind of a side thing, we're kind of doing this benefit.  Somebody beat up a special needs kid in, like, Newark, and so we just want you to just  say, you know, just give a shout-out to the kids so they know not to beat up somebody  with, like, you know, special needs, you know?  Just, you know, just say, like, you know, hey, guys, you know, it's not cool to beat  up somebody just because they're different or whatever, you know?  Just, you know, just like a quick kind of, like, a soundbite. 
[01:01:30]  And it's kind of weird, but throw a couple of, you know, bucks in there just because  our fans are kind of retarded, you know what I mean?  So you need to, like, rock and roll, you know?  So just wing it.  Hey, guys, this is Peter from Inflames.  You should treat everybody equally and don't beat anybody up or do something bad to them  just because they're different.  Everybody's the same way.  Okay, that's totally the perfect vibe.  Just throw in special needs and throw in, like, one or two fucks.  Yeah, the upwards.  Yeah, it's kind of, like I said, they're retarded.  Same thing again, all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, this is Peter from Inflames. 
[01:02:00]  Treat everybody the same way.  You know, people who still have special needs and everything like that.  Don't fucking go and do any bullshit and start beating people up because they're different.  Treat everybody the same, dude.  That's beautiful.  And the kid's name is Russell.  Just give him a shout-out.  Same thing.  A couple of fucks.  I'm a big metal fan, so it'd mean a lot to him.  That's the kid who got beat up.  Russell from Newark.  Hey, Russell.  What the fuck are you doing?  Sorry you can't beat me today.  And just take care of yourself, man.  See you soon.  All right, dude.  That's beautiful, man.  Thanks so much, and good luck tonight.  That's beautiful. 
[01:02:30]  Holy shit.  You are insane.  I love how in the same breath...  I wish you could have seen the looks on their face as they're trying to wrap their fucking  head around the concept.  I don't doubt it.  I love how in the same breath you're saying, this poor special needs kid, yeah, listen,  there's a fucking retarded.  They use this archaic term like retarded.  Oh.  Oh, wow, Bill.  That's great.  Yeah, that was great.  Just add special needs and throw a fuck in there. 
[01:03:00]  Throw a couple of fucks in there.  Oh, and they just do it.  Say hi to Russell.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting.  I'm waiting for us to...  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so sick of waiting for us to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up. 
[01:03:30]  It's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Make a move.  Four golden tickets remain.  Who will we invite to Satellite Radio next?  By the way, Anthony, just a question.  We got the list of fuckos.  Yeah.  Is there anything that these fuckos could do to get off the fucko list?  No fucking way.  It's impossible to get off the fucko list. 
[01:04:00]  What are the likes of a Don and Mike going to do to get off the fucko list?  Stop.  Once you get on our fucko list, it's over, Johnny, right?  What is Phillips over there?  What could he do?  What could Grease do?  Stop it.  Once you make that list, it's over, Johnny.  You're going to sit there on broadcast radio.  A puppet.  Those guys are finished in the business.  Shut up.  Look what we do now. 
[01:04:30]  You know, when they get fired from Satellite Radio, then they'll truly be done.  All right.  We get it.  I wish.  Like we don't know.  It's on television.  Jimmy just looks at you and makes the face.  He's encouraging me.  What are you doing?  That's right.  Look what happened.  We got power back.  Golden ticket.  Come to the palace.  Hmm.  When will we give out the next golden ticket?  Oh. 
[01:05:00]  Stay tuned.  We have to find someone worthy enough.  Yeah, that's the problem.  That really is.  No, Rock Hole.  You don't get a golden ticket.  Hey, guys, come on.  Take me on board.  What about the old days?  For old times' sake.  Sorry, fatso.  Can't do it.  Keep bouncing.  Although there would be food here every day.  That's true.  I'm thinking.  I don't know. 
[01:05:30]  I'm thinking.  Who are you putting?  I'm not telling you.  You've got to tell me.  I'm part of this whole protocol.  This one we can't announce because we are trying to get him.  We just got to try to get him out of his contract.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Absolutely.  We're trying to get him out of his contract.  Uh-oh.  Yes, Jimmy.  Buckle up.  This is just a picture in the paper from Wedding Crashers of Owen Wilson with some balloons 
[01:06:00]  tied around his head.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This guy, what is he going to do next?  What?  Why do you have a problem with Owen Wilson?  He's a very funny guy.  I know.  No, he's a hoot.  Dude, Wedding Crashers is all the talk.  I know.  Wherever I go, that's all I hear.  Did you see Wedding Crashers yet?  I honestly have not seen Wedding Crashers yet.  But it's one of those movies, I haven't heard a buzz like this in a long time, 
[01:06:30]  where people will come up to you like, have you seen this movie yet?  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, it's that whole something about Mary.  Buzz.  Remember the buzz that movie had?  Yeah.  It's got that same type of buzz.  That picture's funny.  Wedding Crashers' number one movie over the weekend.  Yeah.  Beating out Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  By the way, they renamed that movie because Willy Wonka is some kind of slur, I found out.  Please tell me.  Willy Wonka.  Are you kidding?  I was reading an email or an instant feedback from one of our fine listeners 
[01:07:00]  that helps us out on a daily basis,  and they basically said Willy Wonka is some kind of, oh man, like a Vietnamese slur or something?  Stop.  I don't know.  I've never heard of that.  Something.  Somebody will get to the bottom of that for me.  And that's why Hollywood decided, well, we better not call the new movie Willy Wonka  and the Chocolate Factory.  We better just go with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  You that or it's just easier to say.  No.  It's faster.  No, it has something to do with Willy Wonka, I'm telling you.  It has something to do with that.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, second place over the weekend. 
[01:07:30]  Then Sky High, a movie I don't know what that's about.  Stealth and Must Love Dogs.  Ugh.  Must Love Dogs.  Oh.  There you go.  There you go.  One for the fat housewives.  You could all get together.  Go to Starbucks, then go to your little movie.  Ugh.  And dream about a life that you'll never have.  It's not on Snopes. 
[01:08:00]  Huh?  That Willy Wonka thing isn't on Snopes.  I think Must Love Dogs is, uh, uh, older woman falling for a younger guy.  Ugh.  Stop it.  Yeah, because that happens very often in real life.  Ugh.  Go away.  Who's in that one?  Diane Lane?  Uh, Cusack.  And John Cusack.  John Cusack.  Yeah, I want to go see that.  Huh?  Yeah, I want to go see that. 
[01:08:30]  All right, anyway, we can't find the Willy Wonka shit?  Somebody on Instant Feedback will have it in a second.  I think they were fibbing.  Huh?  I think they were fibbing.  Well, I don't know.  Isn't it Charlie also, isn't it, isn't Charlie also slang for Vietnamese?  Oh, well.  Wow, great one.  Charlie.  They called it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because it was the title of the book,  and they say this one is closer to the book than the first movie.  I honestly think that's one of the, I don't think they're saying.  All right, well, I just thought I'd bring it to everyone's attention, 
[01:09:00]  and then we could discuss and see, you know, if there's something to it.  But I just...  All right.  Uh, how was your weekend, Anthony?  Oh, my goodness, what a weekend I had.  Really?  I went down to Atlantic City.  Really?  Tell us about it, Anthony.  Okay, Opie, I will tell you, Jimmy, and the listeners out there.  I will make believe that I did not hear this...  Yes.  ...ahead of time.  Well, you know, I was going down there.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:09:30]  Uh, went down to the, uh, the Borgata.  Last we left you, you had nine G's in your pocket.  I had nine large, Opie.  Nine large.  Went down there, and, uh, for those of you keeping tabs, um, I started out with, uh,  4,000 when I went down the first time.  Built it up to 10, and I took nine with me down there, and, uh, lost $2,500 over the weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  It wasn't one of those big winning, uh, winning weekends.  Did you have Gene Wilder waiting at the front door to say, you loser?  You loser.  Do you have that in your thing yet?  You get nothing.  I don't think I do.  Oh.  I do?  They're pointing at me in the booth going, you do?  You do?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, it happens.  I was playing a lot of the three-card poker, but I played Hold'em, too.  Sat down at the Hold'em table for about five hours. 
[01:10:30]  Had a lot of fun there.  There's some clowns playing.  But none of that matters, Opie.  What really matters is good company.  Isn't that what really matters?  Sure is.  I heard he got recognized like crazy down there first.  A lot of fans were down there.  A lot of fans coming up with the penthouse interview that we did.  Or a napkin or a WoW sticker.  I guess that's now on newsstands.  Yeah.  If you want to spend $9 on penthouse.  I had no idea the magazines were going for that much nowadays.  It's $9? 
[01:11:00]  I believe it's $9 for penthouse.  Oh, boy.  How the hell do they even justify that?  But we have a really good article in there.  Very good interview.  It's like five or six pages, a lot of pictures, blah, blah, blah.  That was cool.  I was at the Hold'em table, and a fan comes up with the penthouse and asks for an autograph.  So I get up from the table and sign it.  And then everybody was all scared because they thought I was a poker player that they didn't know.  Because, you know, who the hell am I?  They didn't know.  They were a bunch of old crotchety guys sitting around a table.  And, yeah, it's not so much about the gambling or the drinks, hanging out watching my brother's band. 
[01:11:30]  It's about good company.  Joining people and hanging out and just having a good time.  You know who was down there for the whole weekend that I was down there?  Your mom and Sal.  Well, they came down, sure.  Tom Jones, because he was performing.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  My brother.  Brother Joe, and it is not you too, Ben.  Dawn and her boyfriend, Patrick. 
[01:12:00]  I say it like that.  He gets...  I've got to recognize him as a person.  Ugh.  Patrick.  Jesus.  From CringeHumor.net?  No.  Oh.  He was down there.  And, yeah, good company.  Oh, oh, I forgot also.  Because I didn't see much of them.  Everyone's busy running around doing their things.  You're in Atlantic City.  You're having fun.  I didn't really see my loved ones very much.  You know who I did see? 
[01:12:30]  Just about the whole time I was there.  Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  Inappropriate.  Horrific to have to be around in company.  Paul.  You know Paul, the guy that hawks Jimmy's wares.  Doesn't he?  What does he do for you, Jimmy?  What does Paul do for you?  Paul and his wife, whenever you do order off the site for merchandise,  for some of that hot merchandise, 
[01:13:00]  Paul and his wife are in charge of shipping it.  Shipping it.  Good job, yeah.  They do a bang-up job.  Yes, very few complaints.  Well, let me tell you something, my friend.  And Paul's wife loves the black cock.  Right.  She does.  If we found out, she likes that.  By the way.  She goes into bathrooms and gets assaulted.  I've made a conscious decision to be very dirty today.  Oh.  If you haven't noticed.  It's working.  It's hot.  It's working.  I wish I kept track of all the curses.  Now, Paul's also called No Filter Paul. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  Because he has no...  Most people have a filter in their head that if you're in a certain company,  you don't say certain jokes that you would normally tell in the other company.  You don't blurt things out.  You keep your voice down when you're saying things that might be inappropriate in a certain company.  He doesn't have that filter at all.  I think he thinks he's being quiet or subdued or coy.  Well, I remember the time he went to a sushi restaurant,  and that's when I realized this guy truly doesn't have a filter.  No.  Telling black jokes and stuff loud as day with black people in the restaurant. 
[01:14:00]  I'm like, I am not seeing this, am I?  He doesn't care.  The first thing that happens is we sit down at the table.  He comes over, and him and his wife sit down at the three-card poker table.  Now, I'm noticing our dealer there is a little, what they call, flamboyant.  Ah, he has a certain zest for living.  He loves dealing queens.  Right.  There you go.  He just kind of had a Nathan Lane look to him, and yeah, he was probably a gay gentleman. 
[01:14:30]  And that's fine.  You look, you know, everyone at the table knows it's no secret,  but Paul just has to blurt shit out, like everyone's making jokes,  and at one point he goes, well, I got my hands full at this table,  and Paul, thinking he's being quiet, leans over and goes,  yeah, a handful, a couple of cocks, eh?  That's him.  And you're like, the guy hears it. 
[01:15:00]  Everyone at the table just kind of goes, well, doesn't want to look at anybody else  because they're just embarrassed.  He's making racist analogies to the cards.  Like, oh, a couple of cards like that come out.  It's like, you know, you want to have people come over to work for you,  and a couple of fucking Mexicans show up.  Like, what?  Oh, my God.  Stop with the Mexicans.  He's throwing the word nigger out in mixed company for everyone to hear.  And you just hear, like, you hear people under their breath when he says it. 
[01:15:30]  You know, oh, I'd rather have nigger than those fucking cards, eh?  You hear people go, oh, God, oh, no.  Like, oh, jeez.  They're horrified.  And I'm sitting there next to him.  He doesn't stop.  It's the entire time.  Just embarrassed.  What is he thinking?  And he's always on.  He can't stop it.  He doesn't shut the fuck up.  He can't shut it off.  He's constantly blurting out inappropriate stuff. 
[01:16:00]  Did you have to go into the high roller area to rid yourself of him?  You have to go to tables that he can't afford?  He just showed up there.  He had a mortgage, something, sold his wife.  Oh, and then he's making, like, inside jokes about his wife.  Because we all know, everyone that listens to the show, we heard her tell the story of going into a bathroom.  There was a celebrity from a soap opera in England.  He was black.  Came in and kind of pinned her against the wall.  Instead of screaming rape, she went to her knees and started sucking his dick.  As any good girl will do.  This black guy. 
[01:16:30]  That's her story.  And secretly enjoyed it.  Well, not too secretly.  Secret?  What kind of secret?  The old roof of misery.  Oh.  No secret.  She enjoyed it.  Right.  So, you know, anybody who innocently blurted out something like, oh, come on, I need a spade.  That was his opening.  You know, a spade.  You like, oh, you want a spade?  That's my fucking wife.  Get out of the bathroom, fucking nigga, suck his cock, is it?  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, and people just looking at her with pity. 
[01:17:00]  Like, and why are you with this guy?  And I was horrified.  Just horrified.  And he wouldn't stop.  That's hilarious.  Oh, he smells like he has a filthy sock tied around his cock.  Paul.  Fucking animal you are, Paul.  There he is.  Paul.  You guys suck.  We suck.  You annoyed Anthony big time.  Paul, you are, you have no, like, you just have no filter.  Wow.  Did you realize that everybody at the table was just horrified at what you were saying? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I had a handful of spades.  I thought I was playing Grand Theft Auto.  Jesus.  He just does, this is what he does.  He just blurts this shit out.  Well, was he sitting, like, around you or right next to you?  Like, right next to me, yeah.  It's hilarious because Anthony was saying the same shit back but quieter.  And he was playing good cop.  He got caught out so bad one time.  I was just, I was, like, trying to keep the humor in it.  Yeah.  Somehow, like, salvage my position there. 
[01:18:00]  And he said something about having kids.  And I might have said something about, yeah, but there's an Amber Alert out for him.  And the woman goes, oh, you're not much better than he is, are you?  And I went off, jeez.  I had to blurt that one out.  Damn it.  He is just, Paul, you don't know when you're being loud or quiet.  Like, obviously, you could kind of lean over and just go, yeah, you say something about the guy being a poof or something.  But you just blurt it out. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  It's embarrassing.  You're the subtlety of a Dominican drug gang.  What were you doing down there, by the way?  Your girlfriend invited me and my wife to meet you.  Really?  Oh, you didn't know that?  Play it off like, oh, I don't know this guy.  Yeah.  Wait.  Who sent the email?  She did, I swear to God.  Yeah, sure.  The story I get is they want to invite us to dinner.  And what do you want to do?  I'm like, I ain't fucking sitting at dinner. 
[01:19:00]  No way I'm sitting at dinner.  But if they want to join us at the card tables, that's fine.  Well, when we were at Jim Norton's HBO taping down there.  No, no, another, the other show.  Sorry, I always get them confused.  The Your Atlantic City Show.  Right.  And then we went to some kind of VIP room at a club.  Right.  And we're all hanging out, celebrating, you know, the great show that Jimmy, you know, put on.  Paul's sitting there waiting.  He wanted me to go downstairs and gamble with him and his wife.  Yeah.  Right, Paul?  Yeah.  And you hung out for a really long time waiting for me to leave. 
[01:19:30]  Well...  And then I finally didn't leave, right?  Uh-huh.  And then you said, can I have your phone number so we can hang out sometime, right?  Uh-huh.  And that would be the text message you never answer ever.  No wonder you haven't got any friends.  He never called you back?  No, never.  No text back, no okay, no go fuck yourself.  How many times did you text me?  I just gave up.  How many times did you text me?  Just a couple.  He doesn't get back to me sometimes if I text him, so it's not a deal.  How many times have you called that phone number? 
[01:20:00]  I've never called it, actually.  Oh, okay.  Because it's not my number.  Yeah, probably.  Did you give him the wrong number?  Oh, jeez.  What was it, off by like one or two?  Oh, no, it was just blatantly wrong, not even close wrong.  Oh, you were awful.  I was thinking of having it off by once so I would have some kind of excuse, like, oh,  no, dude, you wrote it down wrong.  Yeah, you wrote it down wrong, dude. 
[01:20:30]  That's not it.  It's not even the right area code, Paul.  It's been calling Alaska.  Yeah, really?  So you don't mind if I read it out on the air then, huh?  No, I don't really care.  All right.  So, yeah, you've got to rein it in a little bit, Paul.  We were better the last day.  We calmed down.  Because you were just depressed.  Why was Anthony depressed, Paul?  He just spent less money the last two days he was there.  I was losing like crazy.  If my girlfriend wasn't able to win, she was winning. 
[01:21:00]  I was losing miserably.  I had to keep reaching in, pulling out cash.  Again, I was getting the worst hands.  I was in the shit seat.  The one that just was, it was awful.  To the point where I got up when someone left and moved to the seat next to mine,  which is ridiculous to do, and a guy sits down in my shit seat  and just proceeds to get the shit cards that I was getting.  He lost a grand in like a minute.  Yeah, he's putting hundreds up.  And we're laughing because we know how bad that seat was, how cold it was. 
[01:21:30]  And he's putting hundreds up and just losing miserably.  Yeah, I didn't have a good winning weekend.  And every hour, they'd have like a temporary dealer come in  and we had this woman, just like Pocahontas,  and she'd just deal us utter shit the whole table.  And we're like, we'll be back in 20 minutes.  And Paul's just making, like people losing hundreds and Paul's goofing on them.  You don't want to be goofed on if you're losing hundreds of dollars.  Yeah, this one guy was so happy when I said, oh, there goes your college fund.  Yeah, the guy has hundreds up there. 
[01:22:00]  He's making bets, hundreds of dollars, and he loses.  And Paul goes, there goes your college fund.  People don't want to hear that.  You're a pest.  Paul, have you ever gotten punched for the things you say?  Oh, good question.  People think I'm so crazy, they just think there's something wrong.  They're right.  No one in their right mind would be saying stuff like this  if they couldn't back it up with a gun or something.  Yeah.  Well, you know what you guys missed is when we were at Joe's band show,  the people would come up and go to Anthony, you know, 
[01:22:30]  hey, how you doing, all that.  And then all of a sudden they'd be like,  holy shit, you're the dude that fucked the cripple.  Yeah, he was a huge star, by the way.  Right, the guy that had his penthouse sign,  the guy John and his wife Linda.  Yeah.  You ever seen people turn around and he's got like some porn page open,  a penthouse, yeah, sign this.  He's a big star, though.  These guys bought us like a hundred drinks.  We totally forgot which hotel we were staying in.  He didn't get back until 4.30 in the morning.  Yeah, he drinks like a motherfucker, too.  Of course he does.  I was drinking Diet Pepsi the whole night.  Where'd you stay? 
[01:23:00]  In the Bogota.  Okay.  Fucking $500 room.  Jesus Christ.  Is that how much they go for?  $500.  It cost me.  I know you don't ever pay for a room.  You don't get comped?  No, I never pay.  I didn't even get comped.  You don't get comped?  No.  I didn't pay because I was working there.  If I went down there when I wasn't working,  I doubt they'd comp it.  I mean, they're just, you know.  They're running a business here.  Yeah.  We're running a business.  Jesus.  All right there, Paul.  Thank you very much,  and maybe we'll invite you down to Disney  with us in October.  Yeah.  It'll be a fun place.  Hey, you fucking mouse. 
[01:23:30]  Look at him.  He's half spayed himself.  Hey, look.  It's fag day at Disney.  That'll be Anthony just up as Mickey Mouse.  You know, he gets really into it.  Ah, fuck.  That's good work.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Hey, Paul, if Bob Kelly wanted you to do his merchandise,  would you do it?  No, I don't know by accident there.  I have to give him a question.  I've got some business.  Now Anthony is not going to announce his weekend plans in advance.  That sucks.  That's it.  Steve in Kansas, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering, first of all, happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[01:24:00]  Hey.  Hey, when you get rid of all these golden tickets,  are we going to lose all the replays?  No, no, no, not at all, sir.  Not at all.  Not at all.  Okay.  I just, I usually catch you in the evening.  No, here's the deal.  I mean, you know, maybe we'll lose a bunch of stuff on the weekends.  But, no, you'll have plenty of opportunities to get the Opie and Anthony show.  Plenty of opportunities.  I'm not happy with the press release from Washington, 
[01:24:30]  because it seems like they got some things wrong.  We're trying to get to the bottom of that.  Because I was told that Anthony and I would still be heard morning drive on the East Coast  and afternoon drive on the East Coast and West Coast.  Ah.  So, and then the rest is fair game, whatever.  Okay.  To get other people in there.  Well, every show, I'll meet these other guys.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Yeah, you love Ron and Fesman.  They do a great show.  Yeah, we love those guys.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I saw Murderball over the weekend. 
[01:25:00]  It was unbelievable.  It was unbelievable.  I got to thank you for mentioning it.  Oh, very good.  Yeah, I loved that movie.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Can I ask you another question while I'm on the air, though?  Yeah.  How come when you talk about the message boards, you never talk about posttours.net?  I actually don't know if I've ever posted there, to be honest with you.  You got to realize, when you talk about message boards, sometimes they feel left out.  You're not thinking.  You're just talking.  And Wackbag is the most common one, because everybody calls up and says so-and-so from Wackbag.  Like, and cringe humor, I think, of, and opianthony.com or .net. 
[01:25:30]  I don't even know which one it is.  Opianthony.net.  So, normally, posttours.com, I don't think I've ever posted on them.  See, Wackbag is marketed like Coke, Pepsi, things like that.  They're very good at promotion.  And what was the one you had, sir?  Posttours.net.  Yeah, you're marketed like the Opie and Anthony show.  None.  Mike, you know what?  I got to call you out on something.  You didn't really care.  You didn't call about Murderball.  You know that, right?  No, I absolutely did, to be honest with you. 
[01:26:00]  That was your way of getting in so you could bring up.  You could have just.  Opie, I saw the movie over the weekend.  All right, but you could have just said, you know, you're calling about posttours.net.  We would discuss it.  We don't have an allegiance to any of these sites.  I mean, they make a big deal about it on their individual sites.  I'm happy that they're all involved.  You know, but it just turns out that a lot of the stuff that we end up using on our show and stuff  seem to be coming from Wack Bag, so they get a lot of mentions.  That's all.  Well, we just feel like sometimes you leave us out. 
[01:26:30]  We weren't sure if there was a reason for it.  Are you guys linked on opandanthony.com?  Yeah, all the way around.  There you go.  No one's ever sat down and said, all right, don't mention this message.  Never.  It's never come up.  It's all conscious decisions being made.  But isn't there Wow fans?  We love you guys and we support the show also.  Isn't there Wowfans.com?  There's a lot of, there's so many message boards, it's like you just, you get lost.  Like I'll post, I post something on Wack Bag sometimes.  I think it's the biggest as far as members are concerned.  Maybe opanthony.net is, I don't even know.  Opanthony.net is right up there too. 
[01:27:00]  So you'll post something, I'll go, can somebody just paste this on the other board?  Because I have a password for one, I forget that.  I don't have fucking passwords for every board.  So it's like you want all the boards to get it.  It's cool.  Opie, do you know why they fired the coach from Canada?  Oh, I don't know.  They said it at the end of the movie and they never explained it and I couldn't figure it out.  Yeah, I have no idea.  All right, well I'm going to hang up.  I'm sure that'll be discussed on a message board or something about the movie Murderball.  I loved Murderball.  I really did.  All right, posthorrors.net. 
[01:27:30]  Don't forget churchofopie.org.  And don't forget, don't forget, I'll cringehumor.net.  Yeah, they're all, I think they're all linked pretty much to opanthony.com.  All right, thanks.  You guys suck.  And there's other message boards popping up on a weekly basis.  Some make it, some don't.  That's how it works.  I got to plug one thing too for cringehumor and I forgot about this until this guy just  mentioned it.  I'm doing the, there's a cringehumor show and this would help if I knew the date because  I'm a fucking idiot.  But I am, I'm doing this gig for them and a bunch of comedians always do their shows  for cringehumor at the Laugh Lounge. 
[01:28:00]  So just check cringehumor.net for that exact date.  The Laugh Lounge.  All right, it's the worst named comedy club ever but it's not a bad little room.  The Lounge, you sit there, laugh.  The Laugh, big smiles everyone or smiles.  So check cringehumor.net.  All right, can we take a quick break?  I got to take another leak.  What do you need?  Certainly.  I've been drinking a lot of water today.  So I could curse more.  I love the whack bag people now.  What?  This guy is a fucking pussy.  Shut the fuck up.  That's from Cockbuster Video from Whack Bag. 
[01:28:30]  And then Anthony from Brooklyn on Whack Bag.  Wow, wow, this crying bitch.  My website.  Wow.  Ah, they're hysterical.  Hey, did Doug out Doug come on the air?  Because I left a little early last week.  No, he was in on Friday.  What a fucking, what an animal that guy is.  He's like a fucking linebacker.  I'm kind of bummed we didn't get him on the air.  He's done a lot of great stuff for the show.  I gave him an assignment, by the way.  Ah.  A top secret assignment.  Doug out Doug is working on a top secret assignment for the opening of the show. 
[01:29:00]  Does it involve that big upper body of his?  Those strapping shoulders?  Strapping.  If he can pull it off, it will be really, really good.  And probably really funny.  But it's top secret at this, at this time.  Thursday, August 11th is the Cringe Humor Show, by the way.  Thank you, Hawk.  Fucking Hawk is good.  He asked for something fucking 40 minutes later, this kid runs over with the rocks.  Thanks, Bo.  Skating over on his...  Nothing. 
[01:29:30]  You want to say something about mayo leaking out of his...  I'm just going to try, yeah.  That's right.  That's a tough one, because then you realize he has sneakers on.  Look at my top.  Okay.  Snapple and mayo, your dumps must be lovely.  I bet he doesn't even have to push.  Eric just probably hold his pants on, and as he's sitting on the toilet, it's like...  Like centipede.  He doesn't even have to push.  His whole day is spent holding shit in.  Centipede.  Just unbuckle that belt, slide him down, as the knees bend, it's got to be over the  ball.  When the centipede hits that spot where it just goes straight down. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Boo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  Like a fucking, a ropey evacuation.  Smells like a murder scene.  All right.  Festering mayo dump.  Yuck.  All right, we're going to take a very quick break.  All right, take a leap.  When we get back, we'll announce the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest.  That's who won?  Big winner.  For July.  Also, the aristocrats. 
[01:30:30]  Yes, we'll get into that.  Jesus statue.  Opens eye.  What is that about?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  That's a pretty trippy story over the weekend.  And Jim Norton's voicemail that he left for me all drugged up.  It's okay.  And then Bob Brown from 2020 and Retarded Kid.  The Retarded Kid tells a knock-knock joke to Bob Brown from 2020.  Oh, no.  It's a laugh riot.  Worth the price of admission.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar. 
[01:31:00]  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks.  No ashtray.  Ramon, open your mouth.  Hey, thanks for checking out the program today. 
[01:31:30]  We greatly appreciate it.  Oh, we'll smash you guys every chance we get.  But in the end, we appreciate that you're a fan of the show.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  We gave out our first golden ticket, in case you're just listening, for the first time today.  Ron and Fez will be joining 202 in the very near future.  Friends of ours. 
[01:32:00]  I think you guys are going to really, really enjoy their radio show.  We have four more golden tickets to give away.  We're going to save maybe four more shows from commercial radio, and the rest of them could just rot.  It's going to be hard to find four quality shows, that's for sure.  You know, because we're kind of lazy today, so maybe our fans could alert the media that we're going to save four other shows from commercial radio.  Alert the media.  Alert the media.  Immediately.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  What's Jim Norton Phenomenal, what is this? 
[01:32:30]  Sent in by a listener.  A listener contribution.  Hawk.  We might give a golden ticket out to the listeners in general, by the way.  That would be nice.  Someone made a parody song about Jim Norton Phenomenal all the time during one of his OzFest interviews.  But did they, um...  That's what I say to that.  Damn.  Where's the spray?  You don't need it.  It's good.  I need the Lysol.  No, I do need it.  It's not good.  It's a cute little thing I do.  It's cute.  Give me...  I love the fact that we're professional broadcasters. 
[01:33:00]  We just fart into the microphone constantly.  You're horrid.  You're horrid.  Anthony, Tom Jones.  Yes, I also went to see Tom Jones.  To wrap up your Atlantic City weekend, yes.  This weekend.  And I've never seen Tom Jones before.  I always thought it was kind of a goof to go see him because I've heard a lot about his live performances.  His voice is great.  It's held up over the years and stuff.  But he attracts a lot of these older women that I guess were Tom Jones fans and groupies way back when. 
[01:33:30]  Because the guy's got to be in his 60s.  And something that used to happen years ago was these hot chicks would come up and I guess throw their panties at them.  Or a bra or something like that if they want to get Tom's attention.  But it's turned into like a parody of that.  And now when he sings like What's New Pussycat or She's a Lady, a line forms. 
[01:34:00]  An actual line down the aisle forms of these old hags.  These old haggard grandmothers that walk up and throw their panties.  They like bring panties, you know, with them to throw up on the stage with Tom Jones.  So he's up there, she's a lady.  And this grandma who, you know, with arthritis tries to heave these panties and they wind up, they're these big bloomers. 
[01:34:30]  They land on some guy's head who's just there trying to enjoy his fucking drink with his hag that's there, you know, drooling and creaming over Tom Jones.  And he's, yeah, there it is.  She's the kind that I often take to be in her.  Take my panties.  Throw it like damped your pants down.  She's got style, she's got place, she's got place, she's a lady.  She's a lady.  Old, old, old, old lady. 
[01:35:00]  Where?  Talking about her, she's a lady.  I was just wearing the panties.  It is mine.  Oh, no.  How did this happen?  They spin him around and throw him up on stage and then leave.  And the next bag comes up and throws her panties.  And then I noticed, like, a lot of these women now have children.  Some of them aren't that old.  But some of the women, I guess one, maybe he brought her granddaughter. 
[01:35:30]  Because all I know, there was about an eight-year-old girl there, very close to the stage, dancing to Tom's songs.  And Tom goes into, like, sex bombs.  I don't think we have that.  We do?  Have to.  No, I don't think sex bombs on.  You don't have sex bomb?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can find this under Eric R for remixes. 
[01:36:00]  So now, Tom, who, by the way, it looked like Tom had Ben and his hog in his pants.  Just a huge, it was, when he made a move the first time and his shirt kind of pulled away from his legs, you heard an audible gasp from the crowd.  Down his left leg, it went halfway down his thigh, was a bulge that looked like a zucchini was down in his pants. 
[01:36:30]  He's got to be panting.  Dude, whatever it was, it was huge.  Huge cock.  To the point now, it's a complete distraction.  You just found men, women, everyone was reveling in his huge cock.  His own mother.  So here's sex bomb.  And he's gyrating, thrusting his hips, and grabbing that log in his pants.  There's an eight-year-old girl dancing, and he's touching his huge cock and singing about sex bomb. 
[01:37:00]  For us, it's not appropriate to take your young child to a Tom Jones show.  They're passing him notes.  Passing Tom Jones notes as he's on stage.  And you know they're probably trying to have sex with Tom Jones.  And then the little girl passed him a note.  I guess maybe the mother or grandmother was using her as a little thing.  But it was the sickest, like, disturbing image. 
[01:37:30]  How many panties were thrown on stage?  What do you get?  Probably 20.  Jesus.  Probably 20 panties.  And they all just line up?  They line up.  They stand in line and heave their panties at Tom Jones.  But it's a parody of what it used to be.  I guess it used to be kind of, you know, hot chick would run up before security could grab her.  She'd throw her panties, and it would kind of...  And you know women.  They're not going to waste their really good Victoria's Secret panties.  They're going to throw their period panties on stage.  Oh, you didn't know girls had period panties? 
[01:38:00]  I just didn't think they'd throw them up at a live performance.  I saw one pair of big white bloomers that were...  It looked like someone was hang gliding onto the stage.  Just a huge, spinning mess of cloth.  That's what happens at the Tom Jones shows.  Old ladies throwing their panties.  You do realize we're shock jocks, right?  Yes.  You shouldn't be going to Tom Jones.  No, dude, it was a pisser. 
[01:38:30]  The guy is hysterical to watch.  How'd he sound?  He sounds amazing.  Like his voice is still there.  The guy's 60-whatever years old.  He's got that power.  Was it sold out the show?  Yeah.  Yep.  What, three nights, I guess, he did Thursday, Friday, Saturday?  Anthony, we were talking about Buffalo Paul earlier.  The assault on the media contest.  There was a flurry of videos that came in just as the contest ended for July.  Flurry.  I don't want people to get confused.  We're doing this every month.  Every month.  Now a new one starts.  A new one starts today. 
[01:39:00]  But we got a crown of winter for the month of July.  And Buffalo Paul did one over the weekend.  It's pretty funny.  He has like a chicken head hat on.  He's got his own video camera.  So he's filming the whole thing as it's going down.  He's getting the assault point of view.  Yeah.  So there's like tape of Paul filming the cameraman that's filming him for live TV behind the reporter.  It's just a whole mess.  He's got an Open Anthony sign that's huge.  And here's the audio that came off his camera after the live shot. 
[01:39:30]  Open Anthony at XM Radio.  What's wrong with you?  The reporter just turned around after the shot going, what's wrong with you, man?  A little insight because you don't get to see that on TV usually unless you're Arthur Cheyenne.  So the video is up on OpenAnthony.com.  It's a pretty good assault on the media by Buffalo Paul trying real hard to win the contest. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  It has to be annoying the media so badly that this is happening in all these different markets.  Dude, you see all the guys out on the couch?  Those are all new assaults on the media.  Not you?  You?  Who are the two gentlemen there?  You?  He's assault on the media.  What about you?  You?  You're confusing, man.  Or you?  What is the big...  There's a big guy here and there's a little svelte man in a red hat.  He does the media thing.  I'm hearing rumors that this guy's assault on the media on Philly was unbelievable. 
[01:40:30]  We haven't seen the video yet.  What about you?  You?  He's holding a sign.  This guy has a sign.  Wait, it's something.  A sign for me?  A present?  A present for you?  For me?  For me?  I hate presents.  Can I hang it up somewhere?  Uh-oh.  All right, good.  Presents, never good.  I like presents.  I didn't get any yet today.  This is the new one?  Is it good?  Why would you get a present, Jimmy?  Okay.  You've got to save that for now.  It's my birthday.  It's not your birthday.  It is.  August 1st. 
[01:41:00]  It's my birthday.  Thanks, Hawk.  All right, here we go.  The Assault on the Media Contest.  Winners for July.  I found out that there's prizes for first, second, and third place.  Which in third place?  Well, let's start with the honorable mention.  I think you should start with third place.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  I see where you're going.  Yeah.  All right, third place.  I got the audio.  All these videos are up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com. 
[01:41:30]  Anthony, brand new listeners today.  No.  What is the Assault on the Media Contest all about?  Stop.  Brand new?  I swear to God, yes.  Every day.  Every day we're getting brand new listeners.  Well, the Assault on the Media is when, you know the live shots that the news people do?  They get out there on the street, right there in the trenches, where the stories happen.  And there's a cameraman and a reporter with their microphone, and they go live, and you  see the anchorman throws it to them, where you take you now to the subway station, and  they got the live reporter.  What our Assault on the Media is, is our listeners jumping in behind the reporter, blurting out 
[01:42:00]  Opian Anthony, holding up an Opian Anthony XM radio sign, any way to get the name Opian  Anthony and the station, 202, XM, anything like that, in the frame, in the picture, with  the reporter.  That's the Assault on the Media.  We do it for two reasons.  One, to promote the program, because it's free advertising on national television. 
[01:42:30]  And the other reason we do it is because these reporters stink.  They're phonies.  It's all sensationalism and personality contests and bullshit.  And we'd love anything we could do to disrupt them.  You don't touch the reporter.  You don't do anything that might harm the reporter.  You just get behind them.  Make a racket.  Wear something ridiculous.  Hold up a sign.  Whatever it takes.  All right.  So, with that said, the Assault on the Media contest for July is over. 
[01:43:00]  In third place, they win a XM polo shirt.  Ooh.  An XM polo shirt.  An XM polo shirt.  Wonderful.  As this contest moves forward, we'll get much better prizes.  Let's hope.  We had to start somewhere, though.  All right.  But third place wins a XM polo shirt, an XM hat, and an XM seat cushion.  Can I say for the record that that prize package sucks a fat dick? 
[01:43:30]  It sucks a fat dick.  What?  Wait.  It's a polo shirt?  Not only a polo shirt.  I think the smooth jazz station in your town has better prizes.  Jesus.  It is third.  A hat.  A hat.  A polo shirt.  People haven't worn polo shirts since, I don't know.  The 50s.  But you also get a hat and a seat cushion.  That's good.  You get a shirt and a hat so you can do more free advertising for us. 
[01:44:00]  This company just milks you for everything.  You get a free Opie Anthony XM tattoo across your face.  Not only do you have to pay to listen to us, you also have to advertise for us.  Yeah.  And if you advertise for us, you win the ability to advertise even further.  Oh, that's horrible.  Congratulations, you can now wear this logo on your head for free for us.  What an awful prize.  Yeah, you'd think a better prize would be maybe give him a few months for free for helping us out and advertising the show. 
[01:44:30]  No, you get the privilege of advertising some more.  Good job.  Great job with the prizes.  I understand first prize is you actually get a big billboard and you're permitted to hold it up on a highway.  I wear a sandwich board around your neck like the bums.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Yes.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  Tissue, Jimmy.  I don't even know you.  I love that old gag.  The third place winner gets to advertise XM. 
[01:45:00]  That's amazing.  Wait until you hear what second place wins.  All right, so third place, the winner of the XM polo shirt, hat, and seat cushion.  It's, yes, it's the two guys screaming behind CBS3 reporter Brandy Bell.  And can I throw out a suggestion for XM?  If you're going to have somebody advertise like this, I like the shirt and the hat idea,  but the seat cushion, you may want to find a third option.  Who sees that?  In case the guy's asshole doesn't know who to listen to, who should I listen to? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, there it is.  Opie Anthony.  This would be, I believe, third place.  I believe it is a typo here.  I believe it's Tony in Philly, right?  Tony in Philly wins third place.  We got his audio.  The videos are much better.  Tony in Philly.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Here's the audio of his assault on the media.  The videos are much better to watch because the girl reporter freaks out,  and she's beautiful, by the way.  She freaks out like she just heard a bomb go off because they just surprised the hell out of her. 
[01:46:00]  Here's the audio.  Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many turns,  and what we've learned tonight is that the sign welcoming Omar Lazama De La Rosa home  is being torn down and crumpled.  There you go.  So Tony in Philly, congratulations, third place.  As far as the assault on the media contest for July goes.  Maybe he plays polo.  She didn't even finish her live shot.  No.  They had to just go right to the tape. 
[01:46:30]  So there you go.  Good job, Tony in Philly.  You're a star, buddy.  The video is up on opanthony.com.  What a prize.  Oh, and I'm sorry, you have to pay shipping on that.  Is it time for the honorable mention now?  No.  I think it is, though.  I could explain, but then I would wreck the gag.  Yeah.  What?  I was just thinking people get their hopes up as you get closer to another one.  Oh, that's true.  That's true.  That is funny.  The honorable mention has to be after we announce all the prizes. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  I'll explain why that doesn't work afterwards, though.  But I'll play.  Oh, okay.  But it's okay.  I'll go with it.  But I'm scared.  All right.  But I want it to work.  Second place, Assault on the Media Contest for the month of July.  Hey, they win an XM cooler.  No, they don't.  On wheels with a handle in the front, black and gray, and rather huge.  With a giant XM logo on it, right? 
[01:47:30]  Probably not even.  It's just a wow sticker cracked onto it.  They win an XM cooler.  A cooler.  All right.  A cooler.  Yes.  These are awful prizes we're giving out.  Well, you know, for the month of August, we're going to have better prizes.  Is this really our first giveaway?  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Boy, what a bang-up job we're doing.  It's fucking awful.  Pretty much.  Polo shirts and coolers.  And a polo shirt will have the XM logo an eighth of an inch high over the left breast. 
[01:48:00]  If you're going to do it, just do it right.  How about something obscene on the front?  It's the big XM O&A.  Yeah, it'll have a little XM logo on it.  Here we go.  Second place goes to meaty tits versus WHDH TV reporter Dan Housley.  This is Stephen in Salem, Massachusetts.  You might remember this video if you've gone to opianathony.com.  The video is up now.  He is shirtless with wow stickers over his bologna tits on live TV. 
[01:48:30]  He's got his shirt pulled up like kind of over his head almost.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  He had no shirt on whatsoever.  Did he have no shirt or did he just pull it up behind his neck?  Oh.  Because it almost looked like he had like pterodactyl wings or something.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah.  Here's the audio.  I mean, the video is much better, obviously, but this is radio now, isn't it?  In Salem to explain.  Dan?  Well, these were the cigarette lighters that were being sold at this convenience store here. 
[01:49:00]  They may not work great in the wind, but for five bucks, what else you get at them is a knife like this.  And they got a sharp reaction from a North Shore mother who knows a thing or two about hitting weapons.  Yeah, that one's good.  He looked ridiculous.  He got the name out.  He made the reporter kind of stumble on his words.  Isn't that great?  So that's Stephen in Salem, Massachusetts.  He wins the XM Cooler, everybody. 
[01:49:30]  Oof.  Is it time for the honorable mention now?  Whatever you want.  That prize would be better if you filled it with shit.  Honorable mention for the assault on the media contest for July goes out to Buffalo Paul.  Buffalo Paul had two really good assaults on the media in the month of July, and they both fell short.  I thought you were just going to call him some guy from Buffalo.  Oh, really? 
[01:50:00]  Although...  Really dig it in.  Although his latest video is up on opianthony.com, and it's funny, with him wearing the chicken head hat.  I believe he is in first place so far for August.  I agree.  No, the problem is that August 1st starts today.  See, he wasn't smart enough to...  He had so much confidence in...  Oh, no!  When...  Is it when it happens?  Or when you hand it in?  When did it get to us?  Oh, poor Paul.  I think that's got to be up to the show's discretion, though, because... 
[01:50:30]  Well, let's get Steve in here.  Let's get some facts.  Well, no, it came in it exactly.  Whatever will hurt the listener is the way he'll go.  Yeah.  See if he was smart.  He really hates you.  Because, I mean, there was a lot of good ones for July.  I would have just waited to hand in the tape.  Steve, when did you get the...  The latest assault on the media by Buffalo Paul.  I got that on...  I got that on Saturday.  So it actually came in in July.  But that's all good.  But when did it actually make it on the site? 
[01:51:00]  When did it actually make it on Saturday?  Saturday was...  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Our listeners aren't the brightest bunch.  Why would you send it in?  Why would you...  I would have waited a day.  Because there were some really good assaults on the media.  Not only that, he sends it in on Saturday.  And his would have easily been the early leader for August. 
[01:51:30]  So obviously we can't play it until July's over.  So it was never...  There was not even a possibility of it ever being in contention.  Either for July or August.  I got to play devil's advocate.  That's why I kind of think that he should be August.  Because if you look at it from his point of view, it's the first one of August.  Maybe he sent it in Saturday.  Now here's the problem though.  Even though this is a wacky, silly, stupid Opie and Anthony contest, there are rules.  Yeah.  Rules! 
[01:52:00]  And you got to take the rules very seriously.  If this thing was already up on websites in July, I'm telling you.  Believe it or not, we could get screwed in the end.  Oh, Paul, you dolt.  Yeah, we have like a two-page long thing of rules that we have to stick to.  All right.  This just in, Ben is emailing me.  Elo just emailed him.  He wants to give away an Elo haircut for one of the prizes for August.  Thank you, Ben, for helping out the show today. 
[01:52:30]  Now he doesn't even have to be in the studio to bomb.  That's great.  Notice how when it's something like that, if it was Earl, he'd come in here just laughing and cackling,  but if it's Elo, he just quietly emails it.  You sissy.  Oh, my God.  This just in?  This just in?  I got to defend Ben?  Oh, what?  Eric Logan really wrote that.  No, stop it. 
[01:53:00]  He did not.  Go find out, Steve.  Oh, he's printing it.  He's printing it out.  All right.  So, Buffalo Paul gets an honorable mention for the month of July.  And what prize does honorable mention get?  And I was reading some of the message boards for the first time in a while,  and Buffalo Paul basically saying he will not be participating in any assaults on the media in August.  He's going to help out a guy named Chicken Shit.  What?  I guess Chicken Shit and Paul are teaming up for an assault on the media. 
[01:53:30]  Teaming up.  Very good.  Very good.  I like his spirit.  He's got spunk.  Ah, look at Ben coming in with documentation to defend his blood.  Looks like he combed his hair with a fan.  From Eric Logan to Ben Sparks, it reads, how about an Elo haircut?  Now it's funny.  Hey, what's up with the replays?  Was that a typo?  Oh. 
[01:54:00]  Is that good or bad?  No, I think it's fun.  I don't like, we'll talk about it after the show.  This is a very important point.  It's easier to talk about stuff after the show.  Why?  But was it a typo?  We're going to discuss it after the show.  Do you have info?  No, I don't.  Okay.  It's hard to get a hold of people today.  It's Monday.  Ben always sounds like he's hiding something, but he just doesn't know.  Ben, what about it?  We'll talk about it in a minute.  Do you know what you're talking about?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Here's Steve in Salem, Mass.  He's the second place winner for the Assault on the Media Contest for July.  He just won the XM Cooler. 
[01:54:30]  He has something to say.  Yes, Steve.  I'll be excited.  Hey.  You know, it's pretty funny.  I want a cooler, and I have been sober for like 12 years now.  Coolers are only good for alcoholics.  Yeah, you don't bring your Snapple and your freaking sodas in a cooler.  No, no.  You can fucking buy one drink.  I mean, what the hell?  Am I going to sit there and drink fucking 12 Snapples?  Congratulations.  You win a relapse.  Yeah, fill it with booze before you ship it off to him.  All right.  Well, you know, Steve, I mean, because you worked hard for the show, we'll get with Washington 
[01:55:00]  and see if we can maybe adjust your prize accordingly.  All right.  Cool, guys.  Hey.  All right.  Watch it out, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Remind me.  We've got to talk about your hooker.  She got busted.  Yes, she did.  Uh-oh.  There's other news with that whole story, too, about perhaps videotapes that our friends  might be on.  That's a great story.  We've got to start doing some real radio soon because, I don't know, we're just kind  of goofing off, but having fun. 
[01:55:30]  Isn't that what we do?  Yeah, I guess.  We like to pretend.  I make note that sometimes you make a distinction between, well, we're getting something accomplished  or we're not getting anything done today.  Anyway, when the day ends, I don't see a distinction.  Are we truly getting anything done?  I see nothing ever getting accomplished.  That's the beauty of us.  We should talk about all the stuff that we were supposed to talk about someday.  Yeah.  Those things just fly out of here.  That list is really long.  All right, Anthony.  Can we get that drum roll again? 
[01:56:00]  Lots of drum rolls on the Opie and Anthony show.  Drum roll for the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest.  Oh, I thought we announced that already, but that was an honorable mention.  Okay.  First place.  And what's the prize?  Well, the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest for the month of July wins a  MiFi courtesy of MyRadioStore.com.  There you go.  That's MyRadioStore.com.  They do a lot for the program.  And admission to the Opie and Anthony studio in New York City. 
[01:56:30]  But we are not paying for you to come here.  No.  You have to find your own way.  Walk.  But if you happen to be in New York City, you get to stop by and hang for the day.  Is this open forever?  Or is there a time limit?  I guess we'll show up before.  I guess we'll give them a week.  Offer ends August 1st.  I guess we give them a week.  A week?  Where is he from?  And who is the gentleman?  Well, I want the drum roll.  A drum roll, please. 
[01:57:00]  The winner of the Assault on the Media Contest for the month of July goes to...  Do you hear what this politician said in New York?  Yeah, that is something.  Finally somebody with a little bravery.  I like that.  Balls.  We'll get into that next.  Cape Guy versus WWLP-TV in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The guy with the cape.  That's Tim from Springfield.  The winner gets a cape.  Here's his audio. 
[01:57:30]  The video, obviously, much better.  If you haven't checked out these videos yet, go to opianthony.com.  Well, the chief has a hurdle to overcome.  Today, she went before the city's retirement board.  What she wants the board to do is to increase her compensation annually, the retirement compensation,  from $109,000 a year to nearly $150,000.  Well, the chief was successful in one suspect today.  The XM Satellite Radio.  Oki and Anthony are back on XM Satellite Radio.  The reporters spun around, looked at this guy, and just, he was in disbelief. 
[01:58:00]  He was in shock, and then pretty much turned around, and the mic was right in the pest face.  And, of course, the people in the control room immediately cut to tape.  There you go.  The winner is Tim from Springfield, Massachusetts.  Congratulations to Tim.  Tim from Springfield.  Well, that's not that long of a truck.  He could get down here.  What is that, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Springfield?  Three, maybe?  But the beauty is, he gets that fine MiFi, which is just an awesome piece of equipment from XM. 
[01:58:30]  Of course.  I love my MiFi.  And now it's August 1st.  We start all over again.  Kitties, have fun.  Clean slate.  The assault on the media starts today for the month of August.  I think we got a video in, a couple videos.  There's two?  Ooh.  No, that's, okay.  First entry for August is in my hand.  We're going to have the video up later today.  Here it is, show Anthony.  Here is the first video, Anthony, for the month of August. 
[01:59:00]  Coming out of Philly.  Right?  Oh.  It's a black gentleman.  Which means he's got to be, wow, there's a, oh, oh, wow.  I don't know, he's jumped in the background.  I didn't see what he did, though, really.  He was in there pretty quick.  Who was that?  That was it.  Is that you, bro?  Who was that?  All right, come on in.  That guy?  That guy.  He's here, huh?  Did he say anything?  Well, the video's up.  Well, you've got to start somewhere.  And he's the early leader, as far as the assault on the media contest goes for the month of August. 
[01:59:30]  And he's wearing his What the Fuck Is Your Problem Man t-shirt.  Very nice.  What's your name, bro?  My name is Mark.  Hey, Mark.  So, tell us what happened here.  Well, I was driving by my tow truck, and I saw the live shot.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on, Mark.  We'll get to you in a moment.  We just got the seat cushions.  Oh, is that horrible?  This is the fucking prize box.  We're not giving out. 
[02:00:00]  What is this?  It's a seat cushion.  It feels like a graham cracker.  That is...  Those must have cost, I swear to you.  That had to cost...  Ten cents a piece.  I was going to say eight.  Eight cents a piece.  What are these for, in case you accidentally sit on a cock?  These are awful.  This is horrible.  Who's carrying this around anywhere?  Yours is broken already.  Look, look.  Yours already split.  It's fresh out of the box. 
[02:00:30]  It's already split up the seam.  It is made out of...  It's made out of kiddie pool vinyl.  Yeah.  And it's got a piece of foam rubber inside.  All right.  Six cents.  Six cents a piece this makes.  Are you supposed to sit on this?  I don't know.  At a sporting event?  What are you supposed to do with this?  These are the cheapest pieces of fucking shit. 
[02:01:00]  I am embarrassed to give this out as any type of prize.  This is...  And it's got a...  Look, a handy carrying handle.  What's that?  Is that the cooler?  It's luggage.  It is luggage.  It's a cooler.  It's actually fine.  That's the cooler.  That's a cooler?  That's a cooler.  Is that cooler or luggage?  That's actually not bad.  The cooler is fine.  The cooler looks like a travel bag.  Looks like one of those things. 
[02:01:30]  It's got wheels.  It's got a handle that pulls up.  And I guess you...  Where do you put the ice?  That's a cooler?  Then it leaks all over the place or no?  Yeah, it looks...  Oh, the cooler is kind of cool.  Yeah, you can put ice on it.  But it's a cooler.  That's all right.  It would be better if it was luggage.  You could use it as luggage.  It smells like a blow-up doll.  These seat cushions.  The cooler is not that bad.  But the seat cushions are atrocious.  This foam rubber squeezes down to the thickness of a sheet of paper. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  What is that going to do for you sitting on something?  Maybe if you had 10 of them, it would be very effective.  Maybe.  Maybe 10.  Pile up 10 of them.  All right.  Steve's back on the line from Salem, Massachusetts.  Steve, we're checking out your cooler that you want.  Yeah.  Hey, can you guys sign it so I can sell it on eBay?  You know, the things we do sign sell for a lot of money on eBay.  Yeah, and I'll put it towards the O&A fund and try to advertise your show here in Boston.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  You see a lot of ads for us up there, do you?  Yeah.  One wow sticker a week.  Steve, will you be doing more assaults on the media?  Hell yeah.  All right, good.  Because the prizes are going to get better.  Already for the month of August, we got MyFi, day in the studio with the gang, Joey Paisano,  step to the plate.  He's giving out like a $100 gift certificate for his restaurant.  Oh, nice.  What I was thinking is making like an Opie and Anthony day plus the MyFi for August.  So you get the MyFi, which is really cool.  Then you get to hang out and check out a show one morning. 
[02:03:00]  And then later in the day, you go down to Little Italy and you eat at Joey's restaurant,  Paisano's of Mulberry Street, in the heart of Little Italy.  And then what I was thinking, and that's what I was trying to get your attention before  the show, I'm thinking maybe a night at the Comedy Cellar.  Ah.  Maybe you could talk to Esty and see if she wants to do that.  I think that would be great.  You know, a night at the Comedy Cellar for you and maybe three of your friends the next  time you're in New York City.  I mean, this is just an amazing comedy club.  My favorite comedy club in New York City.  Absolutely. 
[02:03:30]  I think they'd go for that.  I'll talk to them tonight.  All right.  So that's what I'm thinking.  And maybe some other prizes will come to the table as we continue.  But game on for August.  And the first one is from this guy, Mike, who's in the studio.  Mark, actually.  Oh, Mark.  Okay, Mark.  So what happened?  Well, I was driving by my tow truck and I saw the news van getting ready to do the live  shot.  So I parked my tow truck behind the building.  And sure enough, I got my friend.  And I'm looking at it right here. 
[02:04:00]  And I got my friend on the phone.  The problem is you can't hear it.  We saw the video.  I know.  Did you yell anything?  Yeah.  I screamed, Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  Cool.  Very cool.  I didn't hear it.  I couldn't.  Can you turn it?  Can you make a sound louder?  What are you dressed as?  Well, I didn't want my company's name represented on the TV. 
[02:04:30]  So I put an orange fluorescent vest on.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm looking at.  He's very brightly colored.  Put the sound up.  And you're in the background, like, just losing your mind.  What were you saying?  I was screaming, Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony are back on XM Satellite Radio.  Did it mess up the reporter at all?  Because I don't have the audio of this yet.  Oh, yeah, it did.  Actually, I did a dumb thing as I was pulling away with my tow truck.  Yeah.  I drove right past the reporter.  And the cameraman got the number off my company and called my boss. 
[02:05:00]  Suffer in succotash.  You're kidding.  And what happened?  Well, my boss called me, and I almost got fired.  All right.  Thank God your boss is a cool guy.  Thank God.  Well, that's probably, you know, I got to hear it.  I have to hear the audio.  But the video, I'm not seeing much of you.  You kind of ran through the scene a little quickly.  Well, I thought the cameraman was going to go after me because he had the camera on a tripod. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, so he could have just left.  Yeah.  At any time and pummeled you.  Yeah, pretty much.  How great would that be for press?  Fantastic.  Let's listen to the audio of Matt.  Mark.  Mark.  Mark.  Mark.  Mark.  Michael.  All right.  So let's listen to Mark.  Mark.  Mark.  Mark's assault on the media.  The early leader for the month of August.  With a C or a K.  We have to start somewhere here.  With the C.  All right.  Here's the audio.  The video is up online already as being the first entry for August. 
[02:06:00]  Now, others in the car were a 17-year-old passenger, a female, 18-year-old woman, and a 20-year-old  man.  Now, one of the passengers was in the car, we're told, was slightly injured and had to  go to the hospital for treatment, according to police.  And they also say...  So you're getting ready to run through now?  ...the charges are pending.  Byron Scott, NBC10 News.  Byron Scott was not thrown.  Yeah, he was smooth.  He went right through the whole thing.  I got to say, I mean, I appreciate anybody that does this, but it's a little lackluster, 
[02:06:30]  my friend.  A little bit.  Yeah, well, it was last minute.  I know.  It was pretty awful.  No, that's cool.  That was awful.  No, it wasn't that bad.  But when you ran through the first time, if you would have came back a second time,  that would have made it a lot better.  Clenched, yeah.  Yeah, the cameraman, Mike, the cameraman aren't going to do anything.  I mean, if they do, you own the station.  Right.  But, you know, you're fine.  They're not going to attack you.  Well, the funny part is that the cameraman...  Hold on, wait.  Hold on. 
[02:07:00]  Hold on.  Sit down.  Did you say the funny part?  Funny part coming up.  You said funny part, right?  Wait, Bart.  Hold on.  Everyone out there sitting.  Wait a minute.  All right.  One second.  Hold on, Mike.  Derek, Danny, Nathaniel, are you ready for the funny part?  Fans, sit down.  Ben, are you ready for the funny part?  Getting a thumbs up in the office way over there.  Eric, ready for the funny part?  All right.  To the million listeners out there, are you ready for the funny part?  Strap in.  Funny part coming up.  Here we go.  Everyone look at...  What's your name?  Mark.  Mark.  Everyone look at Mark for the funny part. 
[02:07:30]  Go ahead, Mark.  Okay, well, when the cameraman called my boss,  he told my boss that they can take legal ramifications for me doing this  and that I ruined a serious, time-sensitive news story.  Can you repeat that?  Okay.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  That's funny.  I'm funny.  I'm happy, I'm blessed.  I'm happy, I'm blessed.  I'm happy, I'm blessed.  Boop, boop, boop, boop. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  I just want to know, what exactly happened?  The cameraman called your boss and what did he say?  He said that NBC10 could take legal ramifications  and that I ruined a time-sensitive, serious news bit.  Hmm.  Time-sensitive.  How did they get your boss's? 
[02:09:00]  Well, I'm driving a tow truck, which is pretty much a moving billboard.  Yeah, you couldn't park it further away?  Well, I did hide it, but my dumbass move, I pulled away right in front of them.  Yeah, that probably wasn't a good idea.  But you're safe.  You have a cool boss.  And we appreciate it.  Well, that's where we begin for the month of August.  Well, there you go.  You're the early leader, my friend.  First entry.  And being your early leader, I'm going to give you one of these seat cushions. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, wow.  For a long day in the tow truck, a seat cushion should make it all better.  That's great.  Oh, boy.  And I'm going to personally sign it so you can make a dollar off eBay.  Oh, that's right.  Get me my magic marker.  Let's everyone sign it so all your beer farts can fucking blast right into it.  Right.  Sitting there in a tow truck all day, sitting on that.  Yeah.  Put it in water and make tea later on.  There you go.  Oh, I'm signing the seat cushion.  Rock on. 
[02:10:00]  That's right.  Opie.  It's an official Opie autograph.  Official Opie rock on.  Let's see.  I'll sign this.  I'm just going to put, wow, because that's one of our little catchphrases.  And I'll sign it, Anthony.  Very nice.  And Lil Jimmy Norton.  I'm going to personalize this one.  All right.  I like to personalize it.  Yeah.  What are you writing?  Best wishes.  Best wishes.  I like putting best wishes. 
[02:10:30]  It sounds like wishes, but it's fishes.  Makes it funny.  There you go.  Jim Norton.  That's what you get for being the early leader.  There it is.  Thank you so much, sir.  Thank you.  Now get the fuck out of here.  Beat it.  It was a fine assault.  That's all that time you get with the radio legends.  Scram.  Scram you.  Mark.  Mark.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, oh.  He was all hoping and wanting.  Oh, he looked.  He peeked back in and.  I like that kid.  He's a good boy.  He's a go-getter.  And there you have it, Anthony.  There you have it.  Now, there's a boy out here who brought you a gift.  What?  A slender boy.  Oh, good for everybody.  All right.  Why don't we take care of this?  Bring this slender boy in.  Yeah, let's take care of all the people out here.  Take care of it.  More faithful listeners stopping by today.  I hope it's not Buddy Hinton. 
[02:11:30]  Hoping for our appreciation.  Here they come.  Buddy Hinton.  Might be a fight out there.  Buddy Hinton.  Wow.  Love that episode.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  I'm surprised that he can walk.  You got a flame shirt on.  I know it's right away.  Yes.  Oh.  What's your name?  I'm Chris.  Hey, Chris, from where?  Deer Park.  Deer Park, Long Island.  Deer Park.  In my house.  Very nice.  Representing.  And who are you?  Frankie D.  Frankie D.  Frankie D, where are you from?  West Babylon.  West Babylon.  West Babylon.  Where?  West Babylon.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:12:00]  Is that an official Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt?  Yes, sir.  Look at that.  Spend a lot of time with your muscle cars out there on Deer Park Avenue?  Yes.  Yes, you do?  Still do.  You have a lot of drag racing down there?  Yes, I do.  Yeah, Babylon Speedway, motherfuckers.  Back out of high school.  Shh.  They're cranking down on that shit.  Yeah.  It's been going on for how many years there?  Yeah, crank it down.  How long have they been doing it?  They're 30 years?  Yeah.  Something like that.  All right.  So what did you guys bring us today?  Well, actually, I supply Steve with flame stuff. 
[02:12:30]  You do?  So I'm really here to give Steve a bunch of flame stuff, but I figured since I was coming  that I would...  I have a ton of stuff.  So I brought you something, I brought you something, I brought you something.  Nothing flame related.  Oh, very good.  I was going to say, if the flame was really lighted on fire because...  This is for you.  I want to be wearing...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  It's a big frame, something framed, it's wrapped.  This is for you.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Uh-oh, they're getting smaller as we go. 
[02:13:00]  They're getting smaller.  And little Jimmy.  Jim.  Oh, look, a cigarette lighter wrapped up.  What I was trying to do for you was a friend of mine actually has a first print Black Sabbath  with...  First print Black Sabbath first album with all four signatures.  I was trying to get it off him for you, but...  But he wouldn't...  I'd give you something out of my personal collection.  Wow.  Thank you.  That's the originals.  You know how bad I wanted to smash his gift and I can't?  Wow, that's original, dude.  This is really cool. 
[02:13:30]  That's original.  A Nirvana poster.  That's right off the wall inside of that gig.  Nirvana in utero, July 23rd, 1993.  New Music Seminar, Roseland, New York City.  I will hang this in my apartment, sir.  This is authentic.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, it is.  It's sandwiched in between the backing and the picture is the certificate of authenticity.  Dude, come on.  Wait, what is it?  It's an autographed Nicholson picture.  Him sitting at the bar in The Shining.  That's great. 
[02:14:00]  That's great.  Well, thank you, sir.  I got a Kiss lunchbox.  When was this made?  This is brand new.  Actually, it's about three years old.  It was a gift to me.  All this stuff was a gift to me.  So I just have way too much stuff.  He's looking at our great things and he has a lunchbox.  I was trying for the album.  I was trying to get him the album.  No, no, that's cool when you see two good gifts.  You'd love to hear about what you almost got.  Autographed Jack Nicholson picture. 
[02:14:30]  A nice Nirvana poster frame.  I pulled that right off of my shelf because the album fell through.  No, no, that's cool.  No, don't say it's cool.  Yeah, I like this.  What's inside, Jimmy?  Maybe something's inside.  There's whiteness.  There's no thermos?  No thermos.  See, now, a lot of times, like these lunchboxes, there's actually a big thing for these, like  a lot of these vintage lunchboxes.  Yeah.  Which would be awful.  You want a brand new one.  So if you save that, though, for like 50 years, just think about it. 
[02:15:00]  Look at his face.  No, it's terrific.  I'm disappointed.  No, no.  I'm disappointed.  I'm disappointed.  I'm surprised it doesn't have XM on it.  You can sit on it.  I was just going to say, Anthony was less disappointed with the knee pad thing there.  No, that's a cool gift.  Carry it up.  Good lunch right in there.  Would you rather have the flaming sneakers or the tag team flaming shirt?  No, no, no.  That's all right.  This is terrific.  Listen to a tinkle.  There's a lot of fun to be had with that one.  The sound of a good lunchbox.  How's that original poster over there doing?  It rocks. 
[02:15:30]  I'm very happy with my gift.  There you go.  Thanks.  There you go.  You want to see the nickel?  No, don't give it to him.  I wouldn't break it.  He's not going to break it.  He's not you.  All right.  Look at that.  Jimmy, there is a hammer and a mallet in front of you, just in case.  Jack Nicholson from The Shining, a film that apparently only Anthony quotes.  I only had one.  Why would Jimmy like a Jack Nicholson signed picture?  I only had one of those.  Yeah, no, there's probably only one in existence, but I'll bet there's a lot of these. 
[02:16:00]  Jimmy, why don't you show your appreciation for the gift?  Oh, no.  I actually, I don't mind this gift.  When I first saw the Kiss, the Kiss thing, oh, look, what happened to it?  Oh, the latch broke?  No, no, no.  It will be soon.  When I first saw the, this is for any Kiss fans out there, it's Raised Faces from the  Originals, which is a compilation album of their first three, which is Kiss, Dressed to Kill  and Hotter Than Hell, all put into one called the Originals. 
[02:16:30]  And I saw that, and I'm like, wow, this has got to be old.  But then I looked at it, and I realized it's in perfect condition.  And it's got a plastic molded handle that...  And it says, Made Me Shine on the bottom, and a perfectly brand new sticker.  I mean, I like this.  Don't get me wrong.  It's actually really a nice gift.  I mean, I was really...  I mean, you look at how the faces are kind of like swollen.  Oh, God.  He's ripping me off, hoo-hoo.  Jimmy! 
[02:17:00]  Tell him, Fred.  That is a...  It's a nice gift.  I dropped it.  I'd like to have another one.  Maybe if anybody else is...  Here's the real gift.  I brought that to you, though.  Oh.  Oh, he's unzipping his pants.  I've got to be honest.  I don't know which of these I'd choose.  Now open it.  Oh, there you go.  There we are.  It works.  Let's sign that in.  Put it up on eBay.  Oh, there you go.  I'll just buy it and break it again.  How's that vintage and rare signed picture of Nicholson? 
[02:17:30]  That is wonderful.  It's Jack sitting at the bar in The Shining.  All kidding aside, this is going to drive him nuts.  No.  Not at all.  An autograph of Jack?  No, no.  Who'd want that?  Who'd want that?  You know.  I mean, he never really comes up on the show.  No.  And, you know, a band you love, an original gig poster that's ungettable.  I mean, yuck.  I like something that you can go out and just grab and any Toys R Us on the way over.  Would you have rather I brought nothing?  Shut your face. 
[02:18:00]  What do you mean?  Would I have rather you brought nothing?  You did.  All right.  To tell you the truth, I thought the Soundeth album was in the bag.  And that was grabbed off my cell.  Oh, man.  I'm brilliant.  He was going to get you something great.  I was working on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy.  You were working on it.  I didn't want to come with nothing.  But I'm glad you smashed it.  No, I didn't mean to smash it.  I mean, it was a...  No, it slipped.  All right.  I actually got scared.  I was frightened.  Yeah.  We'll sign this.  All right.  We're going to sign the broken kiss. 
[02:18:30]  You want to see Steve's stuff?  Yeah, let's see the flaming stuff.  Sure.  Let's see what Steve got before we go to break here.  It's printing money.  This is a...  Oh, wow.  Tattoo.  Look at that flaming.  Flaming tattoo guns.  Tattoo and beautiful black and burgundy.  Some flaming vans.  Very nice.  Some flaming vans.  Look, Steve.  It's like Christmas in here today.  It really is.  Chris sent me a box of...  Eric, here.  Just take this.  The first...  Oh, I've got no mic.  What is that, bro? 
[02:19:00]  It's a face wrap.  It's like a ski face wrap for the window?  Oh, when Steve goes skiing.  Yeah.  Or just walking through the city.  I got one.  I used one when I walked through the city.  Cool gift in August.  For Steve.  Wow.  That's good.  I am speechless.  Now, sit on and try to go through the subway turnstile.  Wow.  There's a...  Lebanese.  There's a terrace with perfect diction.  I'm just going to blur everybody up.  I could just sew five of those together in case Ben gets cold. 
[02:19:30]  Don't agree with your country's policies.  Look at Steve.  You tend to always side with Israel, and a lot of times my people.  Jimmy, look.  Looks like he's done that before.  Jesus.  It certainly has.  Oh, my God.  Does it look like he's just going to anally rape somebody?  Looks like he has put on masks before.  That's it.  Wow.  Can you stand outside of a schoolyard now with an erection?  Steve, what did I say?  Sorry.  It's very wonderful.  No, this is great stuff.  Yeah.  This is really...  I got my bagel. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, you got my bagel.  Oh, it looks like everyone's...  Stupid lunch.  I got to tell you, it looks like everyone is happy in the studio.  It's very...  I think you did a great job.  You did a great job.  Oh, that's nice when you go bicycling.  When I go bicycling.  That's really cool.  And that's a lot.  Oh, look at these.  What are they?  Wow.  Steve, you've got a whole wardrobe.  What the hell is that?  I can't...  Um...  They're like sneaker slippers, but...  But they're giant.  They got...  They're like Mickey Mouse's shoes.  They're like his size.  They're my size.  They're my size sneaker slippers.  It's not for just trotting around the house. 
[02:20:30]  It certainly is.  Those are big flaming sneaker slippers.  Yeah.  It's like a whole...  A lot of thought to that.  It really did.  It certainly did.  He is one of the most thoughtful guys.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Thank you very much.  You realize...  Wait, we've got to stop for...  Oh, yeah.  What's open?  Oh, remember Norton?  Yeah.  I got the...  What else?  Oh, there's plenty more for...  Chris, you need to give out a plug or anything?  No.  Why not?  That's what we do now.  What do you want to plug?  Yeah, what do you want to plug?  I want to plug Verizon.  Blah, blah, blah.  Verizon. 
[02:21:00]  We don't want to plug Verizon.  Yeah, you know.  What is...  Oh, a belt buckle.  A big flaming belt buckle.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  The belt I was telling you about with the bullets, that's coming.  That's coming.  Good.  It's always good when you don't bring all the gifts for one, even one shot.  I'm a happy boy.  I've been mailing Steve's stuff for a long time.  Of course you have.  This is the first time I ever met Steve.  I've just been mailing stuff to him.  It's a magical moment.  All right, Chris, thank you.  Anything else you guys want to say?  Hello to Zoltan.  Hello to Danny Schick.  Yeah, right on, Dan.  I know that guy.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  This was great.  All right, brother.  Nice.  I hope he got the Nirvana poster.  I got the signed Jack Nicholson picture.  Steve got more flameware than he knows what to do with.  Everyone wins here today.  Everyone's happy.  Give the lunchbox back to Jimmy as we go to break.  Here's your kiss lunchbox.  Yeah, you should have.  You should keep that.  That's right.  I like it.  That's nice for anybody that might want to.  That's the sound of quality.  Yeah.  Here's the sound of quality. 
[02:22:00]  Sounds like when you shut the door on your Saturn.  Piece of shit.  Oh.  Four raised faces.  Pristine condition.  Oh, wow.  Don't bring me anything next time.  Holy shit.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  We got some great audio that came in.  Oh, yeah.  Steve just handed in of the mayor of Boston.  Menino, our old pal, Mayor Menino.  He has what amounts to a calf's liver for a tongue. 
[02:22:30]  It's just this giant piece of flesh that knocks around in his mouth and obscures everything he tries to say.  Couple that with him being retarded.  The guy is, he's not very, he's not very bright.  And his speeches are a joke.  Everything he says, everything that comes out of that fat, blubbering mouth of his, is, it sounds retarded. 
[02:23:00]  He's reading to the school kids here.  Dear Mama Brown, the barn, the barn, the barn is very cold at night.  The barn, the barn, he's reading to children, right?  Is that what he's doing there?  Like they're going to the schools.  The barn, the barn, the barn.  Oh, my goodness.  I feel secure with my speaking ability today. 
[02:23:30]  Dear Mama Brown, the barn is very cold at night.  The barn.  He flubbed the barn.  Barn.  And he's reading it.  But I also say, anyone who does this work, it's not for money.  I don't do it for money.  Let me tell you that, my friend.  You know, I see my friends and what they're doing in life. 
[02:24:00]  I say, my God.  I grew up in the streets of Hyde Park.  My father worked in a factory, so I wasn't born with a golden spoon.  Isn't it born with a silver spoon in your mouth?  Yes.  I wasn't born with a golden spoon.  It was born with a ladle in his mouth, and he still has it in there.  What a muttering, stuttering ass. 
[02:24:30]  I wasn't born with a golden spoon.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Should I eat a yogurt that's dated July 12th? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I'm sure it's healthy.  That's a good one.  July 12th.  Anyway, lots of instant feedback coming in.  Can I, by the way, just before you read that, I got to jump in, because I'm always praising  Sabbath and fucking shitting everybody else.  What a phenomenal song that is by Queens of a Stone Age.  I almost threw the CD out until Ben pointed out that that song was on there.  That CD's amazing.  I heard some of it. 
[02:25:30]  It's great.  It's amazing.  I love it a lot, actually.  East Lansing, Michigan.  Scott asks, your gift may suck, but Jimmy, you definitely have the line of the week with,  if you put it up on eBay, I will just buy it again and smash it.  Jimmy, you fucking suck.  You made me bust a stitch in my damn mouth, making me laugh so fucking hard.  That's from Raleigh, North Carolina.  It goes on and on.  And then this guy from Maryland, Dennis C.  Got to call shenanigans on Opie's Nirvana poster.  Does it have a certificate of authenticity?  If it is a green and white poster. 
[02:26:00]  What color is that, Hawk?  Green and white.  Green and white.  Okay.  If it is a green and white poster, they can be bought at any music store for $5.  Uh-oh.  And the one we're seeing online is not green and white.  It's a different color, right?  Oh, boy.  Find the one online.  It's got to be a different color.  And Anthony went right to the Internet, and he cannot match up his Jack Nicholson.  I can't match up my Jack Nicholson autograph with any other Jack Nicholson autograph.  A couple of the discrepancies I'm seeing is that in every other Jack Nicholson autograph, 
[02:26:30]  the I in Nicholson is dotted.  In this one, no.  And in yours, he spells his last name N-I-C-K-E-L-S-I-N.  Also, I haven't seen one Jack Nicholson autograph where the N and then the Iccolson starts inside the N. 
[02:27:00]  Like he drew the N as an afterthought.  Good news.  My thing is selling online on eBay for $8.99.  Oh, my God.  That's really...  Oh, no.  Man.  I would love if this guy would call the show and just be honest with us.  This thing is worth...  It's nice, and I'll do something with it.  Dude, can you just call the show?  We know these are dog shit.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Stop.  You'll call them?  I have things that are signed.  I've seen things that are, like, vintage.  They don't...  They're not in that perfect a condition.  I'll tell you one thing.  There are a bunch of phony Jack Nicholson autographs out there.  Absolutely.  Because I'm looking at so many different versions of his autograph, and this is just another one of them.  And look, he wrote the N for Nicholson, and then inside the N, he starts the I.  Like, it's not separated.  It's squished together. 
[02:28:00]  Almost like he wrote Ickleson, and then tried to squeeze the N in between Jack and Ickleson.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe it was just signed by a guy named Ickleson.  Jack Ickleson decided to sign this.  I can't picture Jack just sitting down and signing that picture of him at the bar.  It's just too perfect.  When I walk by these memorabilia places, I just openly laugh.  They're garbage.  There's no way of knowing anymore.  What is this Merlin eBay thing? 
[02:28:30]  Go away.  I have Merlin flying around my screen.  I fucking hate Merlin.  Where?  Dare I click on Merlin?  Why?  If you have any questions, please email me.  I will get back to you within eight.  I never believe autographed crap.  Hold on.  The guy who gave it to Opie said that the certificate was sandwiched between the poster and the frame back.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  I have one, too.  He said there was a certificate of authenticity, which is also fraudulent, I'm sure.  Hold on. 
[02:29:00]  Look at this certificate, my friend.  Hold on.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Oh, my God.  I can't even explain it.  It's something that your kid would get for graduating kindergarten.  Let me tell you.  It's on yellow paper.  It's run out of a printer.  There isn't a signature on it or anything.  What does it say?  It says, certificate of authenticity. 
[02:29:30]  Guarantees that this collectible item features an authentic autograph signed by Jack Nicholson.  The item was obtained from a reputable dealer and has met the inspection standards of our company.  How fucking vague is that?  A reputable dealer, inspection standards?  And there's no stamp or thing.  It's like, if you had yellow paper and ran it through a printer, you could print.  Oh, he's back.  He's back.  He's back.  I was hoping he was enjoying the program and his truck headfirst into a telephone pole. 
[02:30:00]  Look, I'll proudly display my Jack Nicholson picture.  Here's Ani.  I love the I-ning.  Andy, I'm home.  I-ger.  Classic.  I-ger-ulk.  Well, all right.  Well, we'll get to the bottom of it.  He's just getting back from his cigarette break, so we'll get him back in here. 
[02:30:30]  These fucking gifts are atrocious.  I'm actually liking my kiss gift a little bit better right now.  Yes, you are, I bet.  It was outwardly atrocious.  All right, here's the deal.  So, we need an update on Jimmy.  I got a voicemail after Friday's show.  We had a lot of fun.  How can you, by the way, record them?  Because I have a great one from Florentine that I wanted to get.  What do you do?  How do you get that off the cell phone?  I don't know.  You just put a microphone.  Oh, okay.  Okay, I thought you had a hookup or something.  Oh, no.  We don't have that equipment here at XM yet. 
[02:31:00]  You're sweet.  I don't know how good this is going to sound, but this is the message Jimmy left for my cell phone.  Is it going to be embarrassing?  It's, yeah.  Now, this is after his procedure, and I guess you had an anesthesia.  I played it for a bunch of people, and people were like, he really does call you sweetie when you're not on the air.  I'm like, yeah, it's a little awkward and weird, to say the least.  So here it is.  Jimmy left Friday.  You want to just set it up for the new list?  I left at 10.30 instead of 11, because I had to get.  No, you just ended up staying.  A quarter of.  Because Brother Weez was here doing some good talking with us. 
[02:31:30]  Yes, and Weez came in, and I had to get an endoscopy, which is when they put a tube down your esophagus into your stomach,  just to make sure everything's okay, because I've been having this shallow breathing thing,  and a little acid reflux, so I just wanted to, I'm eliminating possibilities,  and so I go in there, and the guy told me it would take five minutes.  I don't know why everybody said 40 minutes.  I talked to him.  Five minutes.  This guy, I'm even going to plug him.  He was so good.  His name is Leslie, a man named Leslie Sycamore on 58th Street. 
[02:32:00]  He's a gastroenterologist.  This guy's fantastic.  Everything he said was accurate.  Must have gone to school, what, a year or two for that, right?  At least.  That's got to be a fucking fast one.  I mean, according to this guy's, if he is to medicine, what this guy is to paraphernalia,  he picked up a certificate on the way over and just put a tube down my throat.  And I go in there, and the first thing you do, you lie down.  I go to take my camera off, and he's like, just leave everything on.  You don't need to get undressed.  I'm like, well, I wasn't.  I was just taking my camera off.  So I lay on my side.  They put a tube in your mouth, which was kind of odd, without a hand on the back of your head. 
[02:32:30]  Could you make me?  A fleshy tube.  And they knock you out with that stuff I think is called propofol.  How is it administered, Jimmy?  An IV?  A little IV in the back of your hand.  And the guy is great, because he's smacking the back of your hand to bring the vein up,  and all of a sudden, pinch in.  And Wheeze was right.  He said, as they're describing what's going to happen, you're going to go out.  And I felt something kind of odd.  And the guy is going, he's saying something, and all of a sudden, I'm drooling, and there's  nothing in my mouth anymore.  And I'm like, ah, that was nice. 
[02:33:00]  And it was done.  Done.  Fifteen minutes later, total.  How weird is that?  Drugs are so cool.  And by the way, I got photos I should bring in of the inside of my esophagus and the top  of my stomach.  He gave me the color photos.  Really?  And thank you to all the emails, but he was concerned about my procedure.  And it was nothing.  He said, a little swelling in the esophagus from acid reflux.  Very mild.  Nothing.  Just what I thought.  Too much coffee and that type of shit.  That's what it is.  Did you drink coffee today?  Oh, yeah.  But he said, just keep it to a minimum.  Don't drink it at night.  So Jimmy got home, and he gave me a call. 
[02:33:30]  That was not from home, dude.  That was from, I was still.  From the recovery room?  Yeah, I was just sitting there for a few minutes.  Still a little woozy.  I wasn't.  No, it didn't make me sick.  That's why I like the purple fall, unless I'm saying it wrong.  I mean, your head was a little swimmy still?  Yeah.  This is kind of interesting.  Listen to this.  Let's hear it, Jimmy.  A little behind-the-scenes stuff.  We like doing this from time to time.  Hey, Pumpkin, it's me.  It's 1220.  We're not even on the radio.  He's got his radio voice.  The only person that's supposed to hear this is me. 
[02:34:00]  But I didn't call you sweetie.  That's on-air stuff.  Sweetie's faggy.  Pumpkin is the way men address each other.  It's affectionate.  It's the way two real men will do.  It's like an elbow to the ribs.  Hey, Pumpkin, it's me.  It's 1220.  I went in at 12, 15-minute procedure.  I'm a little tired from the anesthesia, so I'm laying down here.  But this guy was great.  He's fucking ass.  He's your rules.  I like him for the reason a lot, by the way. 
[02:34:30]  He's fun to have on the radio.  I love it.  Fuck him.  The guy's like a really good liberal.  You know, he's not like a bleeding heart.  He's fun to go back and forth with that.  He's smart.  All right, man.  Give me a call.  Just relax.  Just relax.  Just relax on my birthday.  Bye, sweetie.  I did call you sweetie.  Yeah, you did call me sweetie.  The difference is this, though.  If you're ending a conversation with sweetie, perfectly acceptable.  If you open up, faggot.  But if you're ending, that's what I'm doing. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I'm sure everyone out there is agreeing.  They understand.  Dude, you can absolutely see what Jimmy would be like if he still drank.  He's the guy that calls you up drunk.  Dude, let me tell you.  Yeah, I was fucking hanging out.  I was just thinking we should fucking hang.  You know, Wheeze is cool, bro.  Like, that was you.  Absolutely.  Wheeze is a hardcore liberal.  Jimmy's like, he's cool, man.  But I liked him when we had dinner.  I'll say that's completely under no anesthesia. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  He's the type.  Everyone says I smash liberals on the left, and I think they're all bedwetters.  No, I don't.  He's intelligent, and he presents his point in a logical, rational fashion.  Not like these shoot from the hip just because it's the party line liberals.  And he's not politically correct, and he's not a thought policeman, which is why I like him.  That's just the way he views politics.  A guy like that's fine, but it's the politically correct, don't say that, don't racially profile.  Those are the ones I fucking, I want to spit in your faces.  Speaking of Wheeze, after Friday's show, I went to the cancer hospital with him. 
[02:36:00]  Oh.  To get his, you know, to see if they got the tumor there.  Right.  And I'm happy to report that there's no more tumor.  Wow.  Good.  No more tumor.  So, you know, so far so good.  Hey, that's good.  They were very, very happy.  They put a scope down his nose, and they're right on the TV.  I'm looking at some awful nose hairs and mucus and everything else.  And then they get to the spot, and it was weird.  It was like a little journey as they're going down to the spot. 
[02:36:30]  And perfect, man.  Clear as day.  The doctor was very, very happy with what they saw.  Hey, did they have to numb his nose?  Because I've had little cameras on the nose.  They blasted him with some kind of spray that he says tasted like dog shit.  I would love to have gotten that spray.  I had to sit there with my head back, and my guy, this is my ENT, he took long, like,  nine-inch Q-tips, and he dips one end in medicine.  Hey.  And, like, as your head goes back, and he just kind of lobs it in a little bit, 
[02:37:00]  and it goes back into your sinus a bit.  It doesn't hurt at all.  It just feels like...  It doesn't have to hurt.  It makes me queasy and woozy.  But lay back.  Put your head back, and your sinus opens, and you can feel it hitting the bone in the back.  Nice.  And it numbs you.  It's a drip.  Nice.  So that was great news for Weez and his wife and everybody else there.  It was a very happy afternoon.  Then we went off and saw the aristocrats.  Hey, you ungrateful assholes. 
[02:37:30]  I bet an XM hat and a cooler look pretty good right about now.  Very good.  That's true.  At least we don't present it as something that was signed by Mr. XM.  This was autographed by Fred XM 50 years ago.  This is an authentic autographed XM vintage hat.  He should have brought A's in that lunchbox and dumped it on himself.  That fucking Nirvana thing. 
[02:38:00]  It was signed by Cobain two weeks ago.  Really?  Was it?  Oh, well.  Somebody else gave me a Kurt Cobain autograph.  Yeah, but that was Dr. Steve.  And I have much more faith in his legitimacy because he actually would look.  He's the type that would look.  By the way, I need Cialis.  And he's an animal.  He would actually look.  I didn't think he was a real doctor at first.  I figured he was just a homoerotic gentleman who wanted to send me chocolates, which I ate  gratefully. 
[02:38:30]  And then he sent me an article on him or a book he wrote.  He wrote a book.  Yeah, he's a real doctor.  It is probably impossible.  The autograph looks pretty good.  It is impossible to verify an autograph.  I don't care about certificates.  I don't care about it.  Unless you're standing there while the guy is signing it, it's impossible to verify.  I have two that I didn't get that I know are good.  One was a Black Sabbath poster signed by all four members at WYSP.  Remember, I bugged them for six months for that because they got it done at a Sabbath  signing.  And Florentine actually gave me an Ozzy Osbourne, Rudy Sarzo, Randy Rhodes poster. 
[02:39:00]  It was an Ozzy poster signed by all three, which he actually got outside of a venue.  Well, they signed it.  Yes.  Now, that Kurt one that Opie's holding.  That looks fake.  It's a copy.  It's a copy.  I didn't bring it home.  The Sharpie that has Kurt is part of the picture.  No, is it?  So he perhaps could have signed that or they put it on there, but it's not a real autograph  picture.  All right.  Real autographs are done usually in shitty pen. 
[02:39:30]  They're not in this person.  Anyone that buys a photograph that's signed in one of these stores, you're a dummy because  they don't sign them.  No.  It's so rare.  You're going to get ripped off.  Anyway, speaking of we's, the left, liberals, the righties, the religious conservatives there,  blah, blah, blah, a Democrat did something very, very good.  Look at this guy.  Very, very good. 
[02:40:00]  Look at what this guy does now.  I tend to smash the Democrats and very rarely give them credit.  But here, New York City politician used racial profiling on subways.  Political correctness won't keep New Yorkers safe from terrorists, a state assemblyman said  Sunday, promising to introduce legislation allowing cops to use racial profiling to target Middle  Easterners when they search bags.  There you go.  Guy's name is Dove Hikind, H-I-K-I-N-D, Hikind. 
[02:40:30]  He charged that it's insane to look for bombs in the bags of 75-year-old grandmothers, adding  the FBI and authorities have a good idea of who is going to commit terrorism.  They all look similar, but everyone is terrified of using the word racial.  Absolutely.  He's a Brooklyn Democrat, and the Republicans, you should fucking shoot yourselves.  You're supposed to be the ones who are tough on law and order, and you just sat there like  a bunch of little bitches and went along with this politically correct nonsense.  So good for this guy, finally a politician with balls. 
[02:41:00]  Once the word racial comes into something, then you're going to have all kinds of problems.  And racial profiling, we know it would work better than profiling, or not profiling, and  just searching everybody.  You know it.  You know who's doing this.  Why can't they profile?  And this guy, going out on a limb here.  And you have to love this guy.  There's a terrorist profile for a potential suicide bomber, and it's not the 75-year-old 
[02:41:30]  grandmother who has an oversized tote bag firmly tucked under the arm, said Hikind, who  called the random searches insane.  Instead, police should be stopping and searching people of Middle Eastern descent, with particular  focus on young men and women.  Every case of recent terrorism has been committed by individuals from a Middle Eastern country,  he said.  There are certain things that you do in wartime that you don't do in peacetime.  Good for him.  And he said he noted that he has voted against racial profiling in the past.  It fits here.  It's a perfect opportunity to use it. 
[02:42:00]  And racial profiling, to me, there's such a direct threat from a suicide bomber.  I don't want to see guys stop because of black guys for drugs or this and that, because that's  not a direct threat to kill a bus full of people.  That's something that you have to have probable cause.  I mean, you have to have probable cause for this as well, I guess.  But there's no direct threat to commit a murder against 75 people or 100 people.  There are white drug dealers.  Absolutely.  There are Asian drug dealers. 
[02:42:30]  With this situation, you are talking every single one of these people.  Show me the last white or black or Jewish suicide bomber.  Show me the last.  Maybe you'll find one somewhere.  Maybe.  I love the way they keep yanking out McVeigh and Nichols.  Yeah, I know.  Right.  A couple of scumbags that got exactly what they deserve.  Life in prison and an execution.  Yeah.  And that was it.  Problem solved.  Problem solved. 
[02:43:00]  We know where they're coming from.  Why can't they just focus on that instead of wasting police resources and compromising  our safety by looking at old women, young white women, anybody that isn't of Middle Eastern  descent?  Just search them.  New York Civil Liberties Union chief.  Now, you know this is going to be rational.  Well, Donna Lieberman called racial profiling discriminatory, and this is, I love this.  She said, it serves no purpose whatsoever. 
[02:43:30]  What?  You're right.  It doesn't.  It doesn't.  Maybe it wouldn't help planes from flying into buildings or people from blowing double  Decker buses apart.  Yeah.  This is why I say the ACLU, the New York Civil Liberties Union, this is why I say they're  irrelevant in their thinking.  Completely.  How could you say it serves no purpose?  It serves the purpose of not wasting police resources and possibly making the subway safer  by looking at the people that are committing these crimes.  That's the purpose itself. 
[02:44:00]  Tell me.  I'd like to ask her how it serves no purpose.  It's a bad law enforcement, she said, and it's fundamentally at odds with our basic democratic  values, which apparently state that you should close your eyes and be blown to smithereens  so you don't hurt somebody's feelings.  There you go.  That's what democratic values are.  Close your eyes, pretend it's not happening, and have you and your family killed in a suicide  bombing just so you don't upset the guy who's probably trying to kill you.  Someone's saying you're mispronouncing this guy's name. 
[02:44:30]  That's very possible.  I don't know what his name is.  Well, let's see.  Mike from Rockland, because this guy should get some credit today.  Mike?  Mike.  Yeah, hello.  Real fast, Mike.  All right, listen.  By the way, Jimmy, his name is Bill Hiking.  He's a Jew from Brooklyn.  Hiking?  Hiking.  Hiking.  It's a D at the end, though.  Maybe it's a...  Oh, hiking.  Okay.  Hiking, yeah.  All right.  I didn't know how to spell it, too.  All right.  Now you know how to spell it.  And Lieberman is just another self-hating Jew.  That's what she is.  Well, I mean, she's a liberal.  Well, I don't see a self-hating Jew.  Anyone that's that far in one direction, it's like they just, again, like Ann says, 
[02:45:00]  they tote the party line.  It doesn't matter.  There's no common sense.  And the religious right is just the same.  We have to keep saying that to pacify people that email me.  Why do you always trash liberals?  I don't know.  I don't know why I always trash them.  It's bad law enforcement, and it serves no purpose whatsoever.  Gee, I don't know why I always trash them.  Yeah.  Have fun on the subway.  Don't worry.  We just checked that baby.  And I don't fault the cops at all for saying that. 
[02:45:30]  They have to say that.  Mm-hmm.  They have to.  Or they're attacked.  And fucking phony Republicans like Bloomberg and all these other pseudo-conservatives.  All right.  No racial profiling here.  That was his top priority when they announced they were doing these searches.  His top priority was to make sure people knew that we wouldn't be racially profiling.  Yeah.  We wouldn't actually try to stop people.  Yeah.  Every seventh person.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  Sure, it does.  Fucking idiot.  Well, Wassam Nasser, head of the New York office of the Islamic Council on American Islamic Relations. 
[02:46:00]  What he said is a little irritating, but it's not that brutal.  Said, this is America.  We don't do that here.  That's racial profiling 101.  That's what we're trying to avoid.  Well, you know something, Wassam Nasser?  How about getting your Islamic Council on American Islamic Relations, and instead of speaking out on something like this,  you speak out on the fact that a lot of your followers are not saying anything about blowing up buses and chopping people's heads off. 
[02:46:30]  Boy, they quote him right here for this one.  Yeah.  Where's his quote about suicide bombers?  Where is that?  Where's his quote about maybe saying it's not a good thing?  An Islamic group recently came out, and they harshly condemned the suicide bombings, and they were calling for like a fatwa against the people who are committing these murders.  And some guy, some Muslim emailed me.  He's like, you know, a lot of times they do speak out.  It just doesn't get depressed. 
[02:47:00]  And maybe there's some truth to that.  Maybe I'm sure that they do speak out, but they just have not been as vocal as they should be.  And it's like, look, you know, how do you expect people to look at you?  We don't want to be racist.  But when people are assimilating into American culture, and these are not just radical maniacs that run around yelling, a lock bar.  These are people, like in England, the guy's a schoolteacher.  These are people that you say hello to and you chat with on the street and you treat like your friends, and yet they are plotting to commit a suicide murder. 
[02:47:30]  When you see X amount of people, when does it go beyond this happens to be Muslims and Jesus, this is happening and it's Muslims who are doing it?  When do you cross that line?  Yeah, you're not sitting there going, I think I might see a pattern here.  This is so blatant.  It's right there.  This is who's doing this.  As long as these stops are done with dignity and you don't humiliate people and treat them like dog shit, you have to realize that most people you search are innocent.  The majority of them are innocent.  As long as you search them and you make sure it's quick and you treat them with respect, that's real, not some phony, you know, yes sir, no sir, respect, but you treat people with dignity. 
[02:48:00]  Everybody understands why it's happening.  Yeah, just search their bags.  All right, let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys, it's Steve from Jersey.  I just wanted to make a comment about this terrorism thing.  You know, you have a black guy who, you know, he's a suspect for a crime.  You have a Hispanic guy, he's a suspect for a crime.  They know he's a suspect for a crime.  They're not going to be looking for white guys.  They're not going to be looking for Asian guys.  They're going to be looking for a Hispanic guy or a black guy or whoever.  Cops do it all the time when they put the word out, you know, there's been a rape or a robbery, and they say, we're looking for a black man six feet tall. 
[02:48:30]  They put out a description.  Is that racial profiling?  Let me argue with this is what they will say to that argument.  They will say, well, that's because there was a witness or somebody to a crime that has been committed that's not racial profiling, that's a description.  This is making an assumption that people are going to commit a crime based on their race, and they haven't.  But there is certain patterns of behavior in certain cultures. 
[02:49:00]  And, again, I talked to some very, like, human rights lawyer at the cellar this weekend, and we had a discussion about it.  And I was talking about racial profiling.  And I used the example.  I'm like, look, when you're going after, say, the mafia, you want to go after the Genovese family, whatever mob you want to, you know, the Gaudis, whoever.  You look for Italian men.  I mean, that's basic.  And she's like, no, no, no, because there's plenty of black drugs.  It's like, don't be so fucking disingenuous with me.  You think I don't know that there are black people and Irish people and Jews that get involved in the mob on some fringe level? 
[02:49:30]  Of course.  But when you're going after the Capos and all these people and the inner workings of the mafia, you do not go after blacks.  You don't go after Jews.  You don't go after fucking 60-year-old women.  You go after Italian men, Sicilian men, because they're the ones that are predominantly involved.  Vito Corleone.  Vito Corleone with your olive oil skin.  Let's say hi to Chris and Marilyn.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  How are you all doing this morning?  Pretty good.  What's up, Chris?  Good, good.  My uncle, he flies back and forth through the airports a lot doing business, and he's got a prosthetic leg from just below the knee down. 
[02:50:00]  Went through one of the buzzers.  The guy made him empty his pockets and everything, and then he goes back through, buzzes again.  The guy says, sir, take your shoes off for me, will you?  He goes, man, I'll do one better.  He unlocks his leg and hands it to the guy.  That guy flipped out, man.  Sir, sir, there's no problem.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Just thought maybe he'd get kicked out.  The guy probably felt guilty because he had asked a man with a prosthetic limb to take it out.  Why would you feel guilty about that?  It's a viable thing to search.  There could be something in there.  Sure.  And again, I only am for profiling when you're trying to stop something that is going to murder people immediately. 
[02:50:30]  Not for drug dealing, not for smuggling, not for anything other than terrorism, which is going to have an effect, which is going to murder a shitload of people in one instant.  Right.  And they are plotting.  Yes.  You know, these are a group of people that hate us.  They hate what we stand for.  They hate our way of life.  And they just want to kill us.  They don't want to negotiate with us. 
[02:51:00]  They don't want to sit down and have a chat and work things out.  There's nothing we could possibly say or do that will change their opinion.  They hate us and want us dead.  Why are we then sitting there playing by these stupid rules so we don't hurt people's feelings?  Because, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, Donna Lieberman, it's discriminatory and it serves no purpose whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  None.  Not even a piece of any purpose. 
[02:51:30]  It doesn't serve a purpose.  Not even a little.  Whatsoever.  None.  Let's say hi to Kenny on Long Island.  Kenny.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, guys.  I went to Lunds recently.  I'm Irish.  And, you know, I don't have a problem with it, but I got searched because I was Irish.  And I think it should happen.  Racial profiling should happen.  You know, it's due, you know?  Well, it's just, when you see patterns of behavior that go way beyond just a couple of people,  you have to be a fucking dummy to not recognize, 
[02:52:00]  all right, this is, in a part of this culture, not all of Islam, we know that,  but there is enough that is radical where this is a tremendous threat.  How many, you think, are they ever going to run out of people to fucking kill themselves in Israel or Iraq?  No.  No.  It's an endless stream of people because, in a part of that culture, martyrdom is heroic.  And stop blaming poverty.  A lot of liberals like to go, well, you know, it's because they're uneducated and poor.  Really?  They fucking flew planes. 
[02:52:30]  These are not dummies.  They flew aircraft.  Yeah.  They're not poor.  They're middle class.  They're well financed.  Absolutely well financed.  And they're recruiting middle class college students in England.  Yep.  So stop with it.  It's poverty.  That's what they say about the Palestinians.  Well, it's poverty.  It's not.  It's religious.  Martyrdom is considered heroic.  It's the hatred of our way of life, our faiths, and the way we live.  We're looked at like we're just these...  Jesus.  Jesus.  Holy shit. 
[02:53:00]  Ooh.  Sorry.  Brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum.  Go ahead, sir.  We're looked at like we're these, you know, godless scum of the earth that have to be eliminated.  Yeah, like you make a film about Islam that they don't like, so they stab you in the chest  and shoot you and sit on you and wait for the cops to come.  Yeah, right.  All right, Jimmy, go ahead.  Yeah, dude, in Israel, the Israeli security forces have like a checklist.  And if you meet a certain number of things on this checklist, they'll just fucking shoot  you in the head.  They've got, you know, young Arab, 20s to 30s, if you're sweating profusely, if you're 
[02:53:30]  praying out loud, if you're recently clean shaven, which is the head and the beard, which  has something to do with getting to a halal faster or some shit like that.  But, yeah, you meet that checklist, they'll just fucking shoot you.  They won't arrest you.  They won't ask you questions.  They'll just take you out.  All right.  Well, if you're running towards a checkpoint, I mean, I think they're pretty willing to  search people as long as you're not, you know, running, yelling something religious.  We should take a break because we still have so much to do.  We got to talk about the Jesus statue that opened its eye. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, a little creepy.  It's not a big mystery, though, by the way.  No?  Somebody was being loud in the house.  Um.  He stinks, but I don't like him.  I just meant that, uh, that there was no mystery because the joke would have been that it's  obvious he opened his eye because somebody was loud, and he was like, what?  Right. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, good Lord.  Hello, exactly.  I'd buy it off eBay and smash it again.  See how we recapture those fun moments?  Come right back.  The foot works.  All right.  Um.  We haven't done.  Hmm, boy.  No, it must have been loud in there.  No.  We haven't done the tube bar tapes in a while?  All right.  We'll play a little tube bar as we go to break.  When we get back, we'll talk about the statue. 
[02:55:00]  Also, Jimmy's Hooker was arrested.  It's a really big story.  Yeah.  Huge story over the weekend here in New York.  And we got Bob Brown, uh, being told a joke by a little retarded kid.  Aw, that's adorable.  Actually, as soon as we get back, we'll get into that.  Mm-hmm.  But first, this.  Hello?  Yeah, listen.  Who do you think you're out fighting like that on the phone?  What the hell?  I asked you for a fucking name, and you start screaming and yelling.  Why don't you come over here and say that to face-to-face, you motherfucker.  I asked you for his name. 
[02:55:30]  What are you yelling at me for?  Why don't you come over face-to-face, and I'll tell you right away.  You just tell me.  You're the guy that's close.  Why don't you tell me where you are, and I'll come over to see you.  All I do is call you up.  What are you talking about?  Why don't you tell me I'll come over to see you where you are?  I'll come over there.  I'll stab you, you motherfucker.  Why don't you tell me where you are?  I'll come over.  You see, you ain't got the guts to fucking face me.  I ain't got the guts?  To fight me.  Why don't you tell me where I am?  I'll come right over.  I'll come over to your joint.  I'll come over to your joint.  You fucking bastard. 
[02:56:00]  What the hell is wrong with you?  Why, you lousy motherfucker bum.  Why don't you go out and go fuck your mother first thing?  I fuck your mother.  Yes, you can do anything you want, you yellow red bastards.  You want me to go over?  Come over.  I'll meet you wherever you want me to meet you.  You don't want me to go over here because all your friends are here because that's what you need.  I'll come over here without my friends at your place.  I'll meet you wherever you want, you yellow son of a bitch.  And you know something?  I happen to know who you are.  And wait a minute if I catch up with you. 
[02:56:30]  I'll put the ZZ on both cheeks of your life.  You'll remember me for the rest of your life.  That's who you are.  That's ZZ.  Your friends told me who you are.  So I know who you are.  I'll get you, you contractor.  And when I do, boy, God bless you.  Yes, hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, can I speak the mic, please? 
[02:57:00]  Mike who?  Unstinks.  Who?  Unstinks.  Mike Unstinks?  Yes.  Anybody name Mike Unstinks?  Mike.  Unstinks.  Nobody with that name.  Nobody.  Thanks a lot.  Two power.  Yes, can I speak to Clint, please?  Who?  Clint.  Clint?  Yeah.  Anybody name Clint?  Clint.  Clint.  Clint.  Clint. 
[02:57:30]  Anybody's name, Clint?  Clint.  Clint.  Clint.  Clint.  Nobody with that name.  Uh, his last name is Taurus, T-O-R-I-S.  Taurus?  Yeah, Clint Taurus.  Clint Taurus?  Yeah.  Clint Taurus.  Clint Taurus.  Clint Taurus.  Clint Taurus.  No.  Oh, he's not in yet?  Okay, thanks.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cop right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  That's what they call me.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  She's a freak.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  That's what they call me.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  Uh.  I'm not going to be facing the wall. 
[02:58:30]  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the T-F-ing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite world treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  That's all right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Shoot your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  Oh.  Tati.  Tati. 
[02:59:00]  Tati.  That's what they call me.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  She's a freak.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  That's what they call me.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  Oh, God.  After I talk you off, I want you to thang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard-nailed cock.  Yes.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day. 
[02:59:30]  Oh.  I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  That's what they call me.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati.  She's a freak.  Tati.  Tati.  That's what they call me.  Tati.  Tati.  Tati. 
[03:00:00]  She's a freak.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I know you want what's on my mind.  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know that you want this time.  I know you know you know you know.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Yes, you are.  Spread the virus.  Tell your friends about the Opie and Anthony program, please. 
[03:00:30]  We got to get Jim Norton in here.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  We stopped with the fucking passwords on a computer?  What happened?  Fucking, it's, I want to fucking just smash somebody's teeth.  He wanted to get online.  I want to check email real quick.  So we all know that in the office computers, you got to have a password to get even onto your  screen.  Right.  So I have a password, and they fucking make you change it every 30 days.  Why?  Because they're fucking cocks.  There's no reason for it. 
[03:01:00]  Do you want to change the password now?  All right.  You got to have capitals and lowercase and numbers.  Yeah.  What a fucking...  I tried five different passwords, and it didn't meet the criteria.  It didn't meet the criteria.  It didn't have capitals and a fucking asterisk in it.  We've talked about this.  The nerds are taking over the world, and this is their payback.  There is no reason for what we do to have to change a password.  Dude, I just...  Fucking eight minutes I wasted in there.  I just sign on.  I open my email.  I hear the rejoiner.  I got to sign off before I can read one of them.  You're not... 
[03:01:30]  We're not in the FBI over here.  Holy shit.  What a waste of time.  Fuck.  You know what, though, man?  I mean, a lot of times people really, they do illegal things, and you got to have some  way to protect yourselves and protect everybody else around you.  Ah, whatever, man.  I'll just make do.  I'll come up with something fun, maybe a funny password.  Cocksuckers.  Nobody is hacking into software sites from here.  There's no reason for it.  Holy shit.  I just hope they keep doing it.  Whatever makes them happy. 
[03:02:00]  That's all I care about.  Elo's happy, I'm happy.  Marsha's happy, I'm happy.  I have a fun happy password.  It's smiles.  Smile.  Because you want to stab somebody in the fucking mouth with your cock.  I want to stab a mouth with my dick.  Repeatedly.  Capitals and lowercases.  Capitals and lowercases and numbers.  That is ridiculous.  What is the purpose of that?  I don't know.  Capitals and lowercases and numbers.  And numbers and an under slash. 
[03:02:30]  You got to have three of the four.  Capital, lowercase.  A number.  A number and a slash.  Let's see.  What is my password?  I can't remember it.  Oh, you know what it is?  It's XM, a capital letter, lowercase, fuck you, and a couple of numbers.  One, two, three, four.  Right.  XM, capital letters, fuck you, lowercase, and a couple of numbers.  All right, well, chemistry sent in something really funny. 
[03:03:00]  Is it chemistry?  Who did that?  Oh, no, this is Henchman.  Henchman.  Don't give people the wrong credit.  We might be giving a golden ticket out to the listeners.  We have four left.  This was by Henchman.  He sent this in.  What is it?  He picked up on the fact that you'd like to say the word phenomenal.  Who doesn't?  Listen to this.  Phenomenal. 
[03:03:30]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Do you ever look back, and again, I know I do, when you look back on something you feel  great about, and then you look back on it, and you go, oh, what the fuck was I thinking?  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  I'm just having stuff.  There's one song, who are you?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. 
[03:04:00]  There's always got to be one buzzkill in life, and I've got to just really quickly address  the post.  A guy named Dan Acvalante.  I want to suck him up in his face.  He gave me a trance on a Sabbath, where Ozzy created horror with his cringe-inducing vocals.  Ozzy sounded phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  There you go.  Wow, that's good. 
[03:04:30]  That's very amusing.  A perfect example why we might give the listener is one of our golden tickets.  That's funny.  A show of their own.  That's by Henchman.  Very good job, Henchman.  I really am a redundant boob.  Good job.  Got to keep that over here so we can play that a few times.  Phenomenal.  Absolutely.  What's that music from?  It sounds like something from Benny Hill.  I've heard that before.  From The Muppet Show.  Remember that?  I've heard it somewhere else, too.  Phenomenal.  Was that it? 
[03:05:00]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Let's see.  Bob Brown from 2020 and a retarded kid.  I don't know the background of this, but I guess a retarded kid had a knock-knock joke.  What could it possibly be?  While Bob Brown from 2020 was, knock-knock, who's there?  The genetic police and we have a gun.  Knock-knock, who's there?  Not a chromosome.  Aren't you? 
[03:05:30]  Aren't you glad you didn't wind up in the dumpster behind a Planned Parenthood?  Oh, it's sort of like that.  You ready for it?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear his knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there? 
[03:06:00]  Olive.  Olive who?  I'll love you, Bob, because you're the best news valier in the whole wide world.  Wait.  Can we play just the setup for that again?  Just the question?  Yeah, of course we can.  Knock-knock.  No, no, no.  I mean, he has to ask the whole, like, who's there?  He has to go.  Who's there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I messed up.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  No, you have to let his answer go. 
[03:06:30]  The guy's Olive.  Yeah.  Cut it after Olive.  Maybe I'm retarded.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  It should have been Olive who.  Olive who?  All right.  Cut it after Olive who.  Yeah, this is...  You told me to cut it after Olive who.  I know, I know, I know.  I strap in, kids. 
[03:07:00]  We all know timing's very important to comedy, so try to recover from this one, Jimmy.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  Olive until they learn to detect this condition in the womb.  I got the hangout. 
[03:07:30]  You want me to try it again?  All right.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  Olive for as long as my family doesn't get sick of me spoiling every photograph. 
[03:08:00]  Are we done or do you have one more?  I don't know.  Anybody else want to chime in with one?  Can't top those.  That's brilliant.  All right, sit in here just in case, all right?  All right.  Just in case you need it.  Olive.  Olive.  Yuck.  Other news, no big baseball trades.  Trade deadline has come and gone.  Surprised the Yankees didn't fucking trade eight rookies for Bob Apodaca. 
[03:08:30]  Shitheads.  Manny Ramirez, very relieved that he continues to get to be a Boston Red Sox.  Yes.  Well, it was going to be a blockbuster trade with the Mets, right?  Mm-hmm.  It didn't go down.  So a reporter got to Manny Ramirez, and this is kind of funny because it's a 15-second clip.  He says man six times and his name two times.  Yeah.  Forget about the trade, man.  This is the place I want to be, man.  And it's great, man.  You know, they love me here, man. 
[03:09:00]  And I don't know, man.  This is the place to be, you know.  Manny being Manny, man.  It's great, man.  Manny being Manny, man.  It's great, man.  Man, man, man.  Right, man?  Manny's an ass.  There you go.  So that's a quickie.  Millionaire.  Yeah.  All right.  That's the guy you want to give $40 million to.  Yeah.  I think we told someone to come by today, so we should let him in here.  Probably spent it all on cookies.  Dope.  We approve this.  Jamie Liz... 
[03:09:30]  Who is this, Hawk?  LaSalle?  Lizon?  LaSalle?  Jamie?  LaSalle?  Eric, you got to say anything.  He just talks.  He walks by.  We can't hear him.  Is Jamie here?  Eric.  Eric.  Jamie, what's up, bro?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you, man?  Good.  How are you guys doing?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  How much you lift?  Calm down a little bit.  Thanks.  Yeah.  You're a big buck.  Hey, thanks, man.  A big buck.  And he has glasses, too, which is deceiving. 
[03:10:00]  So you'd see him across like a table and think you could challenge him and smack him off.  That ain't gonna work.  Nah, one of those big guns would crash into your jaw.  What's your deal there, Jamie?  Just moved to New York.  From Rochester?  Actually, I went from Rochester to Los Angeles for a while.  Uh-huh.  And then just kind of got back East Coast like about a month ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you doing comedy or trying to?  Yeah, I am.  I am.  I actually saw Norton on Thursday destroy a stand-up New York.  Oh, that was, oh, that was, you know what that was?  That was the, uh, Jorge Posada, his son has something, some cranial disease, which I think 
[03:10:30]  he's better now.  Um, but there was a foundation named after Posada's son.  Uh-huh.  So they, I was gonna plug this on the show, but I was under the illusion that it was sold  out.  So they said, uh, yeah, do you want to do this benefit for something that's named after Posada's  son?  He'll be there.  Some of the Yankees will probably be there.  I'm like, yeah, of course.  Uh-huh.  So I go to stand up New York, there's 50 people there, they're filming some reality  show, uh, called, what's it called, do you know the name of the reality show for the Yes 
[03:11:00]  Network, and Posada's wife, who's probably in the top three fucking hottest women ever,  shows up.  That's as close as we got to a Yankee, is Posada's wife.  Posada's wife?  Yeah, it's much like drunk guys with Yankee shirts.  Oh, Christ.  I do a benefit for something named after one of the Yankee sons, and he doesn't show up  for it.  What is, whoa, why wouldn't he show up for something that, uh, is raising money for?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't I care about the sick kids, actually, instead of just being annoyed so I didn't  get a photo of the Yankee? 
[03:11:30]  Good point.  Hey, uh, Ben in Connecticut is on the line.  Ah!  Almost.  95 noise.  Let him lose you.  Ah!  Sorry.  Hey, Ben, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  I've been handing to the knock-knock show.  All right, hold on, I've got to give you the setup, all right?  Setup coming.  Here we go.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I'll live as long as they allow retards to collect shopping carts. 
[03:12:00]  Ah.  There he goes.  Ah.  There was pain in his voice.  As there should have been.  At least he gave it a try, ladies and gentlemen.  Sure did.  Thank you for that fucking ice pick into the funny bone, sir.  That was nice.  So you've been on Leno and all that?  Yeah, I am, man.  A couple, about a year and a half ago.  Very cool.  You do look familiar.  Yeah, man.  Do I?  Definitely.  I get that sometimes.  I've seen you before.  It's so funny, I gave a, I felt like talking to Norm when you were like interviewing Black Sabbath. 
[03:12:30]  I like said hello to you after the show, but I did like this awkward, like, hey, nice show.  And you're like, oh, thanks, and then I walked away awkwardly.  What?  Oh, was it one of those?  Did he blow you off?  Yeah.  No, not at all.  Not at all, man.  But you just, you've had a great set.  I'm nice to people.  Sabbath is Sabbath.  I'm me.  I'm easy.  I'm accessible.  Yeah.  I'm going to hang out at the dumb comedy clubs.  Yeah.  All right.  You ever punch a heckler?  No, never.  You ever beat up a heckler?  No, I never.  I never have.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, hang.  We're going to.  Guy's not an out-of-shape ass like a lot of, like every other comic. 
[03:13:00]  Most comics.  Yeah, you know, I was actually in Baton Rouge this weekend.  You're not an ass.  Yeah.  I was in Baton Rouge.  Baton Rouge, Cindy.  Baton Rouge.  Remember?  That was the one she couldn't get.  She just sat there with her eyes wide open, thinking of her father losing weight.  Capital of Louisiana.  Jesus, he was 195 last week.  He was 108.  I went jogging one morning, and I was coming home.  Of course you did.  I saw the other comedian was, like, walking, like, going for a walk, and I think it's the 
[03:13:30]  only time two comedians have ever passed each other exercising.  He's probably going somewhere unhealthy, too.  He probably wasn't going to the gym.  Yeah.  Probably coming home.  Who was the comedian?  It was, uh, isn't it Mr.?  He's a black guy.  Of course he is.  He's a Mr., of course.  Every time they drop the E.R. and put the A, they have to be black.  Sorry to interrupt this riveting conversation.  Yes, you're right.  We've got a bunch of guys that want to give the punchline a try here.  Okay.  Chad in Virginia.  Hey, I've got a punchline for the joke.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Knock, knock.  Who's there? 
[03:14:00]  Olive.  Olive who?  I'll live as long as Mommy doesn't make the car go backwards.  Suddenly that conversation didn't look so bad, did it, Olive?  Steve in Louisiana.  How about this one?  Knock, knock.  This is the bit talking.  Knock, knock.  I'll live as long as we don't take any more calls.  How are you boys doing? 
[03:14:30]  I apologize.  I'm sure you have a gem coming.  Go ahead, sir.  We'll leave it up to Steve.  If Steve gets a good one, bit continues.  If he bombs, bit is over.  All right, Steve?  All right.  Oh, that's a lot of pressure, fellas.  All right, let's give it a try.  All right, here we go.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I love to run headfirst into brick walls with my helmet on.  The bit will live because you took it into a different direction.  He did.  You, of course, have the humor value of lung polyps. 
[03:15:00]  But I like what you're out with instead of I live, you love, I love.  Oh, thank you, man.  Not his birthday.  Dude, today's my birthday.  August first.  So the bit lives for a little while?  I think so, too, because I love to run headfirst.  It's pretty funny.  All right.  Except he put a helmet on and went to a goofy.  Yeah, that got goofy.  Yeah, he should have said something about how he loves to and then, you know, done something horrific.  Does that piano just, that retard piano just follow him around like a soundtrack?  That's great.  Horrid. 
[03:15:30]  Let's see.  It just sounds dumb.  They couldn't even pick a smart sounding like Beethoven, too.  Ga-gunk, ga-gunk, ga-gunk, ga-gunk, ga-gunk.  It's like what's playing in their little, like, rec room during the rec room time that they get.  Or in his head.  While fucking people are hitting him and molesting him.  Ga-gunk, ga-gunk, ga-gunk, ga-gunk, ga-gunk.  Just hears happy, dumb music.  It's fucking flaming garbages thrown at him by bullies. 
[03:16:00]  All right, we got to get the Jesus story on the air.  Oh, wait, here comes Doug.  Oh, well, this one's got to be good, right?  Doug?  Yeah.  Hi, Doug.  Doug the trucker.  Now, should we do the same thing if he bombs bit over?  Yeah, I say give Doug the trucker.  This is not Doug out, Douglass.  No.  No, this is just Doug the trucker.  All right, well, wait for the setup.  All right, here we go.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive. 
[03:16:30]  Olive who?  Olive until somebody hands me a knife and asks me who's special.  Oh, crap.  Wow.  All right, you can put that CD back in the case.  Yeah, I guess we can throw that one away.  You could take it out of the CD player and put it away.  Look how they massacred my bit.  But New York is a very funny state usually.  Can we try one more?  Once you use all your skills, try to put this bit together.  I don't want Elo to hear it this way. 
[03:17:00]  Can we try one more?  All right.  One more.  He was a trucker, so.  Yeah.  Rich?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  It sounds sharp and a lot of energy.  Rich sounds ready.  It's up to you to save the bit, okay?  All right, cool.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I'll live until I'm strapped with a bomb belt and sent on a bus ride.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, first time, first time.  Sorry, Olive.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Wait, um, hold on.  All right, here, this.  Oh, oh, oh, Jim, are you going to try to save the bit?  Um, yes, but you have to.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  You have to stop at one line sooner.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Oh, we've got to stop it at Olive.  Olive.  Yes.  No, wait.  What do you want me to do?  I'll tell you here.  All right.  Write it down.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  Stoppage here.  Wow.  Right after that.  All right.  But that's how...  All right.  All right.  I'm not going to question the professional comedian.  Here we go.  Knock, knock.  Drop dead, retard.  All right. 
[03:18:30]  Rain delay's over.  Time to play ball again.  We're back.  The grounds crew has come out and taken the tarp off the field.  We're back in the game.  Connor.  Yeah.  You want to continue the bit?  Yeah, let's try it.  All right.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  Olive, as long as daddy don't take mama fishing. 
[03:19:00]  Hmm.  Okay.  Oh, the clouds have come back over the stadium.  Jesus, dude.  I hate when the players are all ready to go again and it starts raining.  I know.  They're calling them off.  They're still tossing the ball in the outfield.  The pitch hasn't even been thrown yet.  Next thing you know, you're tuning in the ball game and they're running a mash episode.  Like, what?  What happened?  I thought the Yankees were on. 
[03:19:30]  They picked the stupidest shit to play during rain delays.  Oh, well.  All right.  Damn, that was funny.  Well, Jamie, just hang.  There's no pressure on the show.  Okay, cool.  It's not like you're having a talk or anything.  Can we try one more?  That music is just...  Oh, it's just...  Eric?  Brutal.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  It's not his birthday.  No, I'm not doing it.  Yeah.  Because that's what you were expecting. 
[03:20:00]  All right, you want to try this?  Yeah.  It's the music that plays when his big fat hands are diddling the neighbor's eight-year-old.  It's great music to smother a cat to.  Hey, Jimmy, did you pick your bar?  Wait, this is the song?  Wait, Hawk is really good at a lot of things.  Yes.  You found what this song is from?  It's an idiot savant without that pesky savant thing.  Wait, you have great timing.  I'd jump in and spoil it.  That's what you should do in comedy.  Let somebody else go through the work of the setup, and then you just jump in and ruin it. 
[03:20:30]  I was headed toward the finish line.  You threw me out of the car and gassed it.  I just flicked my cigarette out.  I jumped in front of you and crossed first.  You ran the whole race, and I get the big W in the winner's circle.  God, what a non-team player bag of shit move that was.  Go ahead, Eric.  What is it from?  A Swedish porn.  A Swedish porn.  Maybe I should have jumped in and said that.  Very nice.  Sweden, heaven, and hell.  How'd you find it?  How the hell?  He finds everything.  How did you find that? 
[03:21:00]  Shut up!  We don't care!  You have it.  That's all that matters.  Good boy.  Eric?  Yeah.  You want to try this?  Yeah.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I love washing your windows with my big, fat tongue.  That's not bad.  Game on!  That's not bad.  Here comes the grounds crew with their rakes.  Can I try one?  Can I do one?  Oh, absolutely.  Uh-oh.  You're in.  This is, uh, Jamie. 
[03:21:30]  Jamie Lissau.  No pressure at all.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I'll live by myself forever.  Oh, my God.  This is really uncomfortable.  I wish you...  It'd be a little bit easier if a smaller guy bombed.  Yeah.  I want to get my first one out there.  Let's get it done.  That's always good.  You get it out of the way.  It happens. 
[03:22:00]  It's not that bad.  Welcome to the program.  Let's go to...  Brooklyn's always good for one.  Yes.  Jim in Brooklyn.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Want to give this a shot?  Yeah, I guess so.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  Olive Special Ed.  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, my God.  Dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  I may need Anthony's help for this one.  Oh.  Oh, really? 
[03:22:30]  Let me ask you.  We're a regular Abbott and Costello.  Here comes a who's on first routine.  Let's see.  Do you have...  Let me see.  Oh, really?  I don't think I have that.  Oh, no?  Wait, what do you got?  Maybe I got it over here.  I want to play.  No, I just...  I want to be part of the fun.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Like some kind of...  Mm-hmm.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  How about this one?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He's writing.  Hold on, kids.  It's all worth it in the end.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Oh, yes.  Hold on.  You got it?  Yeah, are you helping me at all?  What are you doing, Hawk?  He's staying there.  You're putting your dick beaters in front of Anthony.  Just fumbling clumsily with your meaty mayonnaise fingers. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, which one?  This or this?  Okay.  And you'll know when to use it?  I hope so.  Only because Brooklyn called in.  It just made me think of something.  All right.  All right.  What do you need me to do?  Oh, just we'll play the whole set up again, and we'll stop it like we've been doing the  traditional way.  All right.  Here we go.  Wow, the timing on all three of us.  I like that.  Perfect.  All right.  All right.  Start with me?  Yeah.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive. 
[03:24:00]  Olive who?  I'll live in Howard Beach as long as no fuckin' buy the house next door.  I wish we had a beef sound.  I know.  Still works.  Rich in Philly.  What's up, Rich?  I got a olive joke, I guess.  All right.  Knock, knock.  Who's there? 
[03:24:30]  Olive.  Olive who?  I'll live with Bonnie when she married me.  Bravo, sir.  Any joke that bashes Rich Voss is a good joke.  Yes.  Oh, that was a good one.  All right.  Let's go to the statue thing.  And we'll do more olive jokes as well.  I don't know.  This is a weird story.  Listen to this.  They're calling it a miracle among misery.  Dozens of people say they saw a statue of Jesus come to life on a corner known for crime and drugs. 
[03:25:00]  Now the site is becoming a mecca for the faithful.  Byron Scott is live in the newsroom with the Tales.  Good evening, Byron.  Good evening, Brendan.  Many people indeed in that evening are calling it a miracle.  Not only has it brought the community together and drawn in outsiders,  many now say that Christ is watching them.  They looked.  They photographed.  They discussed.  Never opened.  No, never been looking at it.  And then they wade in.  No, I think it's a miracle. 
[03:25:30]  Do you believe in miracles?  I believe in miracles.  It's just a statue.  Poor old beat up statue.  They are talking about this statue of Jesus Christ, more specifically his right eye.  Residents say up until yesterday afternoon, both of his eyes were closed.  Then, when I'm looking at the statue, the eyes opened up.  Caretaker Julio Donas says he also witnessed the Christ statue turn its head and shed a few tears.  He says he has seen the light. 
[03:26:00]  It's a miracle.  The faithful and the curious have flocked to the shrine ever since.  Some say even if temporary, it has replaced the fighting that usually sprouts on their block on summer afternoons.  Everybody's looking for a miracle.  Everybody's looking for hope.  Brittany Morgan drove from South Jersey because her 11-year-old sister was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor.  It's giving us something to believe in that should turn out okay.  This shrine has been outside the Harrison Gardens apartments for the past 26 years. 
[03:26:30]  Now, as for that statue of Christ, Sly, as he's known, said he found it in a dumpster in Jersey City a year ago.  This is a sign from God to show them to come together.  Well, Donas and many others dismiss the idea that their miracle is the work of a prankster.  In fact, Donas expects the other eye to open soon.  Live in the newsroom, I'm Byron Scott, UPN 9 News.  That's nice that the lady with the sister with the brain tumor now has something to look forward to. 
[03:27:00]  Fucking kid's got a softball on her brain stem and you bring it to a winking statue in Newark.  Fucking dope.  I got one.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who? 
[03:27:30]  Jimmy laughed over the part where he falls down.  Let's see this again.  All right, game on.  We should take a quick break.  Yeah.  Hang with Jamie Lissow.  Lissow?  Lissow.  Lissow, sorry.  That's all right.  Lissow.  Do you do any gigs in town?  I'm doing stand-up New York a little bit this weekend.  78th and Broadway.  Yeah.  I'll do this one.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend. 
[03:28:00]  Ed was kind with good intents, but just a little different.  We'd play tag and he'd get hurt. 
[03:28:30]  I'd play soldier heat, heat dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee.  Ed liked talking to a trio special Ed.  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head. 
[03:29:00]  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special Just a little bit special  I ran track, hung out in malls Ed ran headfirst in two halls  I had girly girls and lots of clothes Ed had names for all his toes

[03:30:00]  Ed could count from one to two  I like people and the party scene  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner special Ed  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now his favorite color is the radio  Cause he's a little bit better  Just a little bit 
[03:30:30]  One day talking to special Ed  He grabbed a brick and he swung in my head  And as he laughed at me  That's when I knew  That special Ed just made me special too  My shoes hurt  Now I laugh as I count bugs

[03:35:00]  It's funny  It's like the Howard retard thing  Very, very  I love the music in the background  It just sounds like circus music  Like he should be in the middle of a big tent  And being whipped brutally  While he tries to do math equations  And the long gap  Because he can't remember that the joke is fucking Olive  He's thinking like  Toaster  No, idiot  Olive  Joe in Brooklyn, what's up?  What's up?  I got an olive  Knock-knock  Who's there? 
[03:35:30]  Olive  Olive who?  Olive, my cock is in your mouth, Jimmy  Monster  Damn it  There was a way to go with that, too  Yeah  They just ruined this bit  It's ruined now  They've ruined it  I was in the office  And there was a big protest outside yesterday  Outside of KFC  Kentucky Fried Chicken?  On 6th Avenue  Which I missed  Because I got out of the cellar too late  But apparently they're really brutal to their chickens 
[03:36:00]  And I'm no animal rights activist  But I went to KentuckyFriedCruelty.com  Are you kidding?  No  They got some really brutal footage  Of course they do  But who cares?  I don't like it  Chickens are made for food  They're put on this earth for us to eat them  They're so cute  And what did they show?  Like the boilings?  Just brutal treatment  They said McDonald's actually changed their practice  It's like be a little more humane  You're going to do it  You've got to do it 
[03:36:30]  But out of sight  Out of mind my friend  I don't have to be down there  When they shoot a bolt through a cow's head  But I'm there  Carving up that steak  I'm right there  Well I eat a lot of chicken  And I just kind of felt like  So you're not going to eat chicken anymore?  I will  But not KFC  How do they dispatch the chicken  That upsets you so much  And what would be better?  I don't know  To me there's a better way to do it  There's a more humane way to do it  You would pay more for a piece of chicken  If the cost would be deferred to 
[03:37:00]  Explain what they do to the chicken  Yeah what do they do?  It's just the way they house them  And the way they just  So you're thinking  Nice couch  Plasma screen television  Some rocks up their hallway  Pictures of celebrities  Affordable housing  Maybe enough plastic bags  For their little chicken bathrooms  So you'd rather get their hopes up  Before you kill them  Nah but you don't have to put them  You don't have to put them in a pen  Where they can't move  Yes you do  What do you want them working out?  You want a fat chicken 
[03:37:30]  They have to be stationary  They get room to move  Before you know it  They're on treadmills  They're wearing glasses  And spiking their hair up  And looking like they're in fantastic shape  No matter how much a chicken runs around  They're all these fucking big upper body fat messes  You ever see a chicken with good legs?  All these cocksuckers do is run in circles  And their legs are still atrophied  Chicken legs  Exactly  So there goes that argument  Their muscle is fat things  But they do have feelings  And little beaks that they peck away  I mean like their beaks are falling off 
[03:38:00]  Their fucking legs are  I don't eat the beak  I don't know  I could care less if it toppled off  What you can't talk now?  I don't like cruelty to animals  It bothers me  I want to know what they're doing  That's so cruel  Go to KentuckyFriedCruelty.com  And I'm not an animal right  It's not PETA  God damn fake  God damn PETA  Propaganda site  Let me tell you about PETA  PETA is  The problem with PETA  Is that they're self-righteous  And they're unrealistic 
[03:38:30]  They do raise some good points  About the way animals are treated  But they are a bunch of  Basically flaming liberal assholes  But they do raise some good points  All their points are not invalid  They make some very good points  About  Like I watched footage on Ogresh  Of how they fucking kill an animal  To get fur  And it was awful  It was like  Why  In this day and age  This day and age  Prejudice against fake fur  You know  I don't want to hear any fucking emails  Dude what are you  Shut up  I just don't like cruelty  To fucking something like that  It's annoying  The way they beat something  And rip its fur off alive  It's just annoying  It's cost effective 
[03:39:00]  I know  It's what it is  It's a lot cheaper  To club a seal over the head  Than to use something  That's a bullet  Or a one time thing  Or what  Lull him to sleep  Little Jimmy  Bouncing him on his knee  As he drifts off to sleep  Yeah maybe  Something nice  That's why I don't eat lobster  They throw it in there alive  It's because you're not just  Conking on the head first  They have said that  There is no pain there  What are they going to say  They have studied  The nervous systems  And realized that  There is no pain  To these animals  They don't feel it 
[03:39:30]  Where did you learn that  I don't know  I don't buy  Their little lobster eyes  Are all exposed  You ever see a lobster eye  It's always open  It's on a stem  How could that not hurt  With boiling water  Throw it on it  It's on a stem  And they're at the beach  All the time  There's got to be sand  Getting on that thing  Always  You can't pick it out  With the claw  Blink it out  And get right back  In the water  You can't blink  Sensitive glassy eye  Always open  Always  Looking  You know how bad  That eye wants to close  When boiling water is on it 
[03:40:00]  Nothing makes you want  To close your eye more  Than scalding water on it  It did a pull  Wow  It did a pull  Let's get a Randy in New York  Randy  Hey I'll do one of those  Fine knock knock jokes  You have  Oh  Alright  Knock knock  Who's there  Olive  Olive who  Olive until God  Fixes all of his mistakes

[03:42:30]  I never liked it  Mean to them  The end result is  They're going to be pulverized  That's very true  I just don't like  I don't like cruelty to animals  I never did  It bothers me  You shouldn't give them hope  I think that makes it worse  Let them know  They're all stacked up  On each other  You think the chicken cares  Yes  No he doesn't  They gotta be  It's gotta be unpleasant  They don't care  You want them hoping for death  If you're on a farm  You're running around  You're having fun  Someone calls you over  You're like  Alright what  Hey why is my head  Going on this big wood pillow  Next thing you know  It's done  You gotta feed  Millions and millions  Of people  That don't work anymore 
[03:43:00]  Might have worked for the little village  Back in the olden days  But now  You gotta  It's gotta be automated  There's still a way to do it  Without being as  Fucked up  Not for a food chain like that  They can do it  Let's say hi to Matt in Philly  Matt  Hey boys  How you doing  Good  I got a knock back to it for you  Alright  Knock knock  Who's there  Olive  Olive who  I love you  Bud
