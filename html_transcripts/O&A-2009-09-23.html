<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Whip Em Out Wednesday" announcement and a plug for new stickers, quickly transitioning to a discussion of the Yankees' playoff run.  The main focus then shifted to Mackenzie Phillips' revelation in her new book about an incestuous relationship with her father, John Phillips. The hosts reacted with shock and crude humor, speculating – with sexual innuendo – about the situation and even mentioning a rumor involving Mick Jagger. Callers weighed in, with some criticizing Phillips' motivations as publicity-seeking, while others defended her right to tell her story. The debate touched upon the ethics of revealing such personal information after John Phillips' death, veering off into tangents about other celebrity scandals, Plaxico Burress's sentencing, and the state of Detroit.  A discussion of a remarkable basketball shot and promotion for Jimmy's stand-up show in Boston concluded this segment.  They also briefly mentioned a home invasion and an upcoming Larry King interview with Tyra Banks.


The next segment started with two home invasion stories: one about a retired police officer fatally shooting intruders, and another featuring an 88-year-old WWII veteran successfully defending himself and his wife.  The hosts reacted with vulgar jokes. The conversation moved to Curt Schilling's failed Senate bid, deemed a publicity stunt, followed by a discussion about remastered Beatles albums and the habit of repurchasing media in different formats. This led to jokes about the extreme punishments for illegal downloading.  A caller briefly mentioned a Kelly Osbourne incident, but the conversation quickly shifted to music-related tangents (Jerry Rafferty/Gary Wright, Chuck Mangione), including Anthony playing a slide whistle for a listener challenge. Their meager Sirius XM prize closet was also mocked.  The final major topic was Larry King's interview with Tyra Banks, which was dissected with vulgarity and sexual innuendo focusing on Tyra's appearance and Larry King's questions, again framed as a publicity stunt.  Crude jokes, comparisons of Tyra's hair to a Klingon's and a mumps wrap, dominated the discussion, punctuated by more complaints about the prize closet and continued commentary on the Tyra/Larry King interview.  Co-host Sam Roberts' "sick day" was a recurring comedic topic throughout.


A phone call from "Larry" dominated the following segment, filled with sexually suggestive and racially charged comments directed at Tyra Banks (who was a guest), with graphic descriptions of touching women's hair and comparisons between Black and white women's hair textures.  The conversation spiraled into offensive territory, with Larry making inappropriate comments about Black women. The hosts reacted with shock, amusement, and disgust.  Tyra Banks eventually defended herself, addressing societal pressures and stereotypes faced by Black women regarding their hair, also discussing her career and experiences with racism in the modeling industry.  Numerous comedically absurd calls from Larry King further fueled the chaotic, offensive nature of the segment, interspersed with discussions about censoring the audio, Jim Norton's upcoming shows, the "Shit My Dad Says" Twitter account, and a preview of an upcoming Michael Moore interview, including discussion of his film "Capitalism: A Love Story".


The Michael Moore interview segment focused on the 2008 financial crisis, criticizing Wall Street's practices, the AIG bailout, and the lack of accountability. Moore discussed the diversion of scientific talent to Wall Street, high unemployment (mentioning Michigan), crippling student loan debt, and the perceived misuse of bailout funds. The hosts and Moore debated the role of unions, with a heated exchange between Opie and a caller, Nick, resulting in Opie repeatedly muting the caller’s microphone. The segment concluded with promotion of Moore's movie and Opie's comedy shows, including a humorous anecdote about a 56-year-old virgin at a town hall meeting and a mispronunciation of "Tim Sabian."


The final segment discussed Tyra Banks and her experiences with racism, again punctuated by crude and offensive jokes and remarks, including sexually suggestive and racially charged comments referencing shirts with offensive slogans. A "Line of the Day" segment was mentioned but its content remained unclear.  The hosts consistently used profanity throughout this portion of the show, which concluded with a transition to "Ron and Fez."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's go!  Ay, nigh. Ay, nigh.  Keep fucking that chicken. Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay. Okay. Okay.  Open Anthony. Okay.  Hello. What is it? What is it? Hump Day?  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Good old Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[00:00:30]  And you know what? I think there's a resurgence happening out there with the Whip Em Out Wednesday thing.  Yes, I see more stickers.  Well, we're running a promo. We got brand new WoW stickers with another radio station or another company name on them.  Yeah.  Collect them all.  Get another one. Collect them all. That would take a while.  Really?  I think so.  Well, the only one that...  Quite a few. The national ones.  Oh, that's true, too.  Yeah, there's been quite a few.  But good news. I mean, we're running a promo. 
[00:01:00]  You could send away for some WoW stickers.  You put them on your car. And I'm telling you, it's funny because every person that puts a WoW sticker on their car wants to see boobies.  I understand that.  Yeah.  And then every person that doesn't see boobies that have a WoW sticker on their car, they get really mad.  Yes, they do.  But the percentages are way up there if you do have a WoW sticker on your car.  Yeah.  If you don't have a WoW sticker on your car, there's not a chance a girl's just going to flash you.  No, when was the last time you're just driving and getting flashed? 
[00:01:30]  How great would that be, though?  It doesn't happen.  You put a WoW on there and...  Yeah, you know, it's happening.  We know it's happening.  It's happened for many, many years.  Yep.  So listen for the promo on this fine channel if you want to get your WoW stickers.  Yankees in the playoffs, Anne, I see.  Yes, they've clinched a playoff spot.  You know, that's like if the worst case scenario happens, they'll, you know, they'll still be in.  Even if they fall apart now.  Yeah, well, they're not going to fall apart. 
[00:02:00]  I don't want to see that happen.  They just beat the Angels last night, which they've had a problem doing.  Right.  But they did.  And I guess the Sox lost.  Yeah.  So now there's six games in front of the Sox.  What's the magical number?  Six.  Six now?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's good.  I like that.  But it's not a number.  It's not a magical number.  You're in the playoffs.  Yeah, but you want to clinch the division.  Yeah, I know.  That's to clinch the division.  You want to clinch the division.  You don't want to make it in on the wild card. 
[00:02:30]  Leave that to Boston.  Well, this story just hit the wire.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  This one's a fresh one.  Did you read this yet, Jimmy?  If it's the one that starts Mac, you bet I did, and I love it.  It's fresh, and it's fresh.  And it's hot.  Oh, my goodness.  This is Mackenzie Phillips.  Yeah.  Now, the older audience that we have, they absolutely know who Mackenzie Phillips is.  Yeah.  The younger folks, maybe not so much. 
[00:03:00]  But she was on a little show called One Day at a Time.  Yeah.  As the ugly sister.  The ugly sister.  She was ugly.  She was always ugly.  She'll always be ugly.  She is an ugly broad.  As opposed to, oh, there it is.  Oh, look, Schneider.  He's got his cigarettes rolled up in his sleeve.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  His propofol in a hanky, apparently.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[00:04:00]  What else?  Give me a little Mamas and the Papas there, Travis.  There you go.  All the leaves are brown.  The sky is gray.  All the leaves are brown.  Leaves are brown.  And the sky is gray.  And the sky is gray.  I came for a while.  That chicken there. 
[00:04:30]  And not Mama Cass Elliot.  Who's the other one?  Oh, Michelle.  Michelle Phillips.  Phillips, right.  In the old days, like the album cover days.  She was hot.  Yeah, she was like hot, hippie chick looking.  But then again, standing next to the big mama there.  Mama Cass.  Mama Cass Elliot.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, look at that.  She was hot.  You know, she just had a big, hairy, out-of-control bush. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, that muff must have been.  She was smoking pot and giving up her badge for all the hippies.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Where's the color picture of her?  Anything?  Anything?  Then she got kind of like icy cold looking as she got older.  You notice that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I kind of like the little hippie look.  Oh, yeah.  She had a beret because she was fighting some evil man.  Man. 
[00:05:30]  She was in some kind of an underground movement man.  You know, she just grew in her armpit hair.  It didn't matter, though.  Big fat mama Cass Elliot.  Anyway, you know the players.  So, you got Mackenzie Phillips, the daughter of John Phillips from the Mamas and the Papas,  and, of course, Mackenzie Phillips from One Day at a Time.  Well, here we go.  Mackenzie Phillips is quoted saying this.  I slept with my own father. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Dennis!  Wow.  Yeah, we need some stingers for this story.  Yeah, where the hell is my stinger?  I slept with my father, Mackenzie Phillips is saying.  Don't hate my father, Mackenzie Phillips tells People Magazine.  But in a tell-all book out Wednesday, the former childhood actress reveals that her dad,  musician John Phillips of the 60s band The Mamas and the Papas,  engaged with her in a long-term, incestuous relationship. 
[00:06:30]  Long-term?  What the fuck?  Wow.  Phillips, 49, who has survived drug addiction, arrest, and divorce,  writes in the book High End Arrival that she was already a star playing a boy-crazy teen  on the TV sitcom One Day at a Time when her father had sex with her on the night before she was to marry.  Wow.  What the?  And a little pop style.  Pop style sucks. 
[00:07:00]  No, it's great.  Well, you see if you want to give this up.  You leave the daughter alone the day before she's getting married.  What is he, one of those ancient lords that had to come by and fucking bang the chick?  The Mamas and the Caligulas.  God damn.  Wow.  On the eve of my wedding, my father showed up, determined to stop,  it writes Phillips, who was 19, and a heavy drug user at the time.  I had tons of pills, and Dad had tons of everything, too. 
[00:07:30]  Eventually, I passed out on Dad's bed.  Oh.  Should I read more?  Please, go on.  This might get a little naughty.  My father was not a man with boundaries.  He was full of love, and he was sick with drugs.  I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my own father.  Once again, I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my own father. 
[00:08:00]  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Did he break our oymans?  I hope he didn't break our oymans.  It'd be terrible.  I nigh.  Right in the dirty spot.  I nigh.  Not in the freckle.  I hope he didn't bang her in a freckle.  Stick to the vagina.  Keep it all legal. 
[00:08:30]  Stick to the vagina, as long as you don't break the oymans.  What the fuck?  Damn, yo.  I guess that explains the drug abuse, huh?  A little bit.  So, yeah, he was a father with no boundaries.  Had this happened before?  I didn't know.  All I could say is it was the first time I was aware of it.  For a moment, I was in my body in that horrible truth, and then I slid back into a blackout.  Phil's life began to spiral out of control. 
[00:09:00]  In 1980, she was fired from one day at a time because of her constant drug use.  That same year, she went to rehab with her father.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's good.  Went to rehab with the problem in her life.  Must have been nice meetings.  She was probably at the meetings screaming, but my daddy's...  It's the drugs.  You'll come down from this.  That's just hallucinations.  Yeah, yeah.  And then she has to go back to her room, and the lights go off, and there comes Papa. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, Papa John Phillips.  But he was older.  It's weird.  She was 19 when he started having...  It's not like she was a little girl.  It's like, that's what's weird is that he just started banging his teenage daughter.  Well, I guess she's hinting that this might have happened before the day before her wedding,  but she's not sure.  This was the first time she was aware, but I think she's hinting that she's got to think  that it happened more than one time.  She even toured with him in a band called The New Mamas and the Papas. 
[00:10:00]  Her sexual relationship with him had become consensual.  Wow.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Consensual.  Sure.  Ugh.  What the fuck?  She started liking it in the crepa.  I nigh.  Oh, Jimmy wasn't here for this bit.  Oh, yeah.  That's got a million of them. 
[00:10:30]  What is the freckle again?  The freckle.  Is the ace?  That's the ace.  The ace.  Oh, nigh.  I was a fragment of a person, and my secret isolated me, she writes.  One night, Dad said, we could just run away to a country where no one would look down  on us.  There are countries where this is an accepted practice.  Maybe Fiji.  Yeah.  Move to Fiji so you can have sex with your daughter? 
[00:11:00]  Fiji.  What the fuck?  He was completely delusional.  No, no, I thought, we're gonna go to hell for this.  Yeah.  Ah.  She knew.  The end.  The end.  Wow.  Cute story.  That's a hell of a way to start another radio show, huh?  Jesus H. Christ.  And then she goes to rehab with the guy.  That was her only chance to get out of that craziness.  That was, uh...  Wow, that's a fucked up little story there. 
[00:11:30]  Who knew when you're watching one day at a time?  Let me say hi to Ken in Texas.  Ken, how are you, Ken?  Hey, Ken.  What's going on, Ken?  Good, Ken.  What do you got, Ken?  I saw Michelle, I mean, uh, yeah, McKenzie being interviewed one time, and she said that  Mick Jagger tricked her dad into leaving her apartment he was visiting, and he's the one  that popped the shirt, like, when she was, like, 13.  Mick Jagger got a hormone?  I know. 
[00:12:00]  He blasted raw through a hormone.  He blasted raw through a hormone.  He blasted raw through a hormone.  Left the bleeding on the bed, did he?  Ah, that Mick Jagger.  Ain't he something?  Did he bag her in the freckle?  I know.  Wasn't she, like, 14, too?  I think she was about 14 when Mick Jagger banged her.  Allegedly.  I don't know.  I don't think Mick would deny that.  Big didgeridoo, did she, eh? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Broke her arm.  Who enjoys the didgeridoo?  Piked her in her vagina.  He did.  He piked her in her vagina.  Well, was she 10 years old?  10?  In the vagina?  Mick Jagger?  No, Mick Jagger said he was waiting for this since she was 10 years old. 
[00:13:00]  Ay, nay.  What the fuck is wrong with Mick?  Man, they got away with a lot of shit in the 60s, huh?  Yeah, you wouldn't even...  You can't make that statement.  No, you can't.  You're fucking crazy.  Who the hell's gonna make that statement?  She's 14, and if that's not bad enough, you go, oh, I've been waiting for this since you were 10.  Oh, my God.  But Mick, did Mick really think he was showing restraint?  I waited through her 11s and 12s.  Yeah, waited all those years. 
[00:13:30]  He's lucky he's a talented motherfucker.  So I think we'd look the other way.  I'll let Mick do whatever he wants, man.  You hear, give me shelter?  Let this guy fuck whatever he wants.  He waited for, like, the first little fucking one single hair.  That's what Mick was waiting for.  Let me say hi to Jeff in Indianapolis.  Jeff.  Good evening.  Hello, Jeff.  Hi, Jeff.  Baby wants to fuck. 
[00:14:00]  Wait, I know that reference.  Do you know that reference, Ant?  No.  Oh, fuck, I've heard that before.  What's that from, Jeff?  Ah, just a little blue velvet, you know.  Blue velvet.  You mugger, mugger, you mugger.  Ah.  Blue velvet.  Thank you, sir.  That's fucked up.  Fiji, well, this is Barrett from Pittsburgh, Anthony.  He writes, Fiji Travel Info shows that it's the home of incest and anal sex. 
[00:14:30]  Is this true?  No.  Could we, uh.  Is that on a travel brochure?  It can't be on a.  Is it really?  It can't be on the actual travel brochure, but I think if you dig a little bit.  I know.  Is that what they're bragging about?  Come to Fiji?  Wow.  Who knew?  I thought Fiji was like one of those places you just kind of go there and go on vacation.  It's kind of nice.  I don't know.  Is Fiji a nice place?  For real? 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  I think my mom and Sal went to Fiji.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You're going to have to ask him about Fiji at the big wedding this weekend.  Robin from Detroit.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Is it cold in the day yet, or is it a little too early still?  No, it's damn humid and hot to tell you the truth.  Well, goddamn.  It's so hot in the day.  Day.  Yeah, the D's got a lot of problems.  No shit.  Um, yeah, I was calling about this Mackenzie Phillips thing. 
[00:15:30]  Whether it happened or didn't happen, first of all, he's dead.  He can't say, he can't defend himself, but I think these stars sometimes put this stuff  out so that they're the big talk of the town because they're so irrelevant in our lives,  and now we're talking about this dumb bitch.  Yeah, but you just come out of nowhere and blast that one out?  Well, you know what?  Again, we don't know if it's true or not, but everyone's going to be talking about it.  Look at you denying the victim.  Well, I think she's sick to, first of all, put that in a book to make some money and some 
[00:16:00]  fame for herself.  Secondly, if she is just making up to get the fame and a little money in her pocket, that's  even sicker.  That is kind of crazy.  Either way, it's pretty fucking sick.  That doesn't sound like something you'd make up, to be honest with you.  No, no.  You make up a child molesting story, not an adult, oh yeah, it was consensual, and then  we had a consensual affair.  You would say that you got touched by some nameless relative that no one feels like looking  up or whatever.  I think they were so fucked up on the dope. 
[00:16:30]  You know what I mean?  The dope.  Right.  Yeah, I mean, and I don't know.  The dragons told them to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I just think that what point is there in putting it in a book?  We can't prove it or disprove it.  Well, it's her life.  Hold on, miss.  If she's telling you a story about her life, you don't need us to disapprove it.  I mean, if she wants to tell it in the book, that's fine.  Yeah.  Right, but what benefit is there about telling somebody something like that, especially when  the person that she's talking about isn't around to defend themselves or say it's not  true when... 
[00:17:00]  Because honestly, let's just say for the sake of argument it's true, then who gives a fuck  if he's around to defend himself?  If she was having sex with her father and she's writing it in a book, who cares if he's  around to defend himself?  That's the decision he made when he started to fuck his daughter.  Well, true, and it could be true.  I'm not saying it's not.  I just think it's ridiculous to tell something like that, true or not.  Why?  And everyone's going to be...  Well, I think that these stars love to put these books out and have everybody talking  about them when no one gave a shit about her for 30 fucking years. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, but miss, that's not...  I don't agree with you because people telling their life story, this type of stuff happens  to regular people.  It happens to people.  And it's interesting.  Yeah, that's right.  It's in books.  It's interesting, but it's just a salacious story that...  So what?  You know.  But it's almost like...  She's not buying it.  Would you object, miss, if it was a wonderful story about how great a guy her father was?  No.  So why should she not tell if it's a hell story?  Well, that's true.  And I'm not saying it's not true.  I just think it's a ridiculous thing to put in a book to get your face on the news and 
[00:18:00]  make some money.  That's the only reason you write a book at all, though.  What do you think people write books for to not sell them?  Well, who the hell gives a shit about Mackenzie Phillips anyway?  Obviously, we do.  We're all talking about her.  We all know her.  Well, because she fucked her dad.  Yeah, that's where Robin's making a good...  Sort of a good point.  I'm sure when she decided to write this book, the book people said, well, what do you got  to offer?  And she finally got to this point. 
[00:18:30]  Well, I could tell the story about me and my dad.  You know what I mean?  And they're like, well...  Sure.  And now they're like, okay, now we got a book.  And now we're all talking about it because it came out today.  If her book came out and this wasn't in it, we wouldn't be talking about it.  We wouldn't even know she had a book out.  That aside, Robin, I believe the story is absolutely true.  Absolutely.  And it could be.  But I just think it's stupid on her part that she needed money.  I don't understand what your point is, Robin. 
[00:19:00]  I don't get what your point is.  People put things in their biographies that include horrible things or fantastic things.  And that's why you read them.  Not only for the publicity.  That's kind of a side effect of it.  If you put something salacious in a book and it's true, it's going to be the selling point.  People are going to go, wow, here's some excerpt from the book.  It doesn't necessarily mean you put it in there just to get the publicity.  Right, but that's the only thing in that book that's going to make people buy it. 
[00:19:30]  How do you know that?  No, there's the drug stories.  She's a big star.  Robin, she was a tremendous star on television.  She was in a huge series.  People have known about Mackenzie Phillips for many, many years.  And she was fucking her dad, who was one of the mamas and the papas.  You know what?  People want to read that, me included.  She was in American Graffiti.  She was getting banged by Mick Jagger while she was filming it, perhaps.  Well, you can line your birdcage with the rest of it, then. 
[00:20:00]  How do you know what the rest of it is going to be?  Oh, no one fucking cares about her for the last 30 years.  Is she on TV?  What book?  You're making no sense.  I would only read that chapter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would start with that one and then go back to chapter one.  What is it your problem with this?  I don't understand Robin's point.  Well, I think the point is, I think she's off, but, you know, it's not far-fetched that celebrities make up shit.  Points on her head.  Or exaggerate shit to get publicity.  I'm with her to that point, but this story is absolutely true. 
[00:20:30]  There's no doubt in my mind.  I'd believe it.  Maybe she's exaggerating the details a little bit in the book.  Who knows?  But the story itself is absolutely true.  The rest of the book could be full of growing up with a drug-abusive father and the mamas and the papas  and then being on one day at a time and, you know, American Graffiti.  We all know the story.  Who gives a shit?  All right.  Thank you, Robin.  Robin.  I'm not a fan of Mackenzie. 
[00:21:00]  There's something else going on with Robin.  It's like your point is ridiculous.  Who gives a shit?  She was a fucking icon fucking her dad.  Yeah.  That's an interesting point for a book.  What Robin's acting like, you should write a book with no selling point.  Right.  No selling point.  She's only saying that to make it interesting so you buy the book.  Yeah.  All right.  How annoyed would you be if she left that out?  Yeah.  If she wrote a life story and she didn't put fucking her dad, Robin would call up and  go, well, I would have bought the book if I knew she was fucking her dad.  Why wouldn't she put that? 
[00:21:30]  Shut up, Robin.  Jesus Christ.  She bugged me.  What's wrong with Robin?  She's out of her mind.  She had a hatred for Mackenzie Phillips.  I didn't like it.  She certainly did.  Let's go to Josh in D.C.  Josh.  Yeah.  You need to add her to the radio station, the manhole.  You just.  That's what happens when you add someone with the name of Robin to your show.  Oh.  I didn't even realize.  Oh, my God.  I want to choke that bitch.  She was a phone hole.  I kind of.  Jesus Christ.  I kind of liked her because she was getting under Jimmy's skin. 
[00:22:00]  Well, you know.  I don't understand her point.  Jimmy, you wrote two fabulous books and you talked about hookers and you talked about  life on the road and that's what made me want to buy your book because of cool stories  like that.  Of course.  And some chick wants to talk about fucking her dad.  I'm buying the goddamn book.  But Josh, here's the problem.  All the stories in Jimmy's book made up.  All of them.  That's right.  Just to get a little fame and a little money in his pocket.  All those hookers.  I didn't have sex with them.  No.  Lies.  Jimmy, Jimmy, we all know that your stories are fake.  We know you're just some rinky dink stand-up comedian who doesn't travel anywhere. 
[00:22:30]  Rinky dink.  And I'm a sweet boy.  Oh, my God.  You're a nice guy.  You played some games when you were a kid.  But really, you didn't really have any book.  Just played some games, you know.  Money.  I got a Monopoly, Chutes and Ladders, Monster Rain, just a few games as a child.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So, tell Robin if she's still, you know what, Robin, if you're still listening, you suck,  all right?  Robin calls our show all the time.  Does she?  Yeah, she does.  Yeah, I've heard her before.  But, man, I was about to throw my radio out the window. 
[00:23:00]  I'm not kidding.  Fuck.  Thank you, Josh.  Very good phone call.  All right.  I got an email.  You went to about books from a girl.  Oh.  And she's like, I don't know if you remember me, but I used to do massages.  And apparently she was a girl that I had seen.  And she read my book.  And she said it was hilarious.  She loved it.  She's out of the business now.  But she was a massage girl slash prostitute.  And she wrote about her exploits in an article. 
[00:23:30]  And it turned out to be a 14-page email.  It was fucking great.  I called my literary agent.  She can really write.  I would love to see this girl do a book.  What do you want to talk about, though?  Having sex with, like, clients?  She talked about it.  She broke it down.  Oh, who wants to hear about that?  So what?  She had sex with clients.  She's a prostitute.  Everyone wants to hear.  That's funny.  Dude, it was so good because she broke tricks down into different categories of the type of  guys you meet and how to handle each one. 
[00:24:00]  And she was like, she wrote me a very nice email.  She's like, you were really nice to me, I remember.  Oh, wow.  She remembered me because I told her.  This is back when I lived on 43rd Street.  And she's like, you know, you were one of the really nice people to me.  And I just loved her fucking writing.  It was so interesting to read it from that point of view.  Wow, yeah.  Did you treat those people like human beings?  I spit on them and say, here's your money, dog.  I thought you were supposed to treat them like robots or something.  He doesn't stretch out their vaginas.  It's a small wee-wee joke.  Oh, I didn't get it. 
[00:24:30]  I thought it was a courtesy joke.  Let's go back to the Robin thing.  Because people have some observations.  Brandon in Houston.  What's up, Brandon?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a theory about Robin.  I think her dad was fucking her.  Because this seems like a very sensitive subject to her.  Yeah, Robin, call back if you're not telling us something.  Something, yeah.  Any problem.  Yeah, because she had a lot of passion for that topic.  Let's go to John Phillips from the grave, Anthony. 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  This is very special.  Yes, John.  Yeah, man.  This is John Phillips.  I'm calling from the grave.  I did not have sex with that woman.  Punch it out.  I know.  No.  Not ever.  I know.  All right.  So we got that story.  That just broke.  So that'll be everywhere today.  Does the mainstream media cover that?  That's a rough one.  They don't do a lot of incest stories.  They won't get detailed.  But they'll kind of gloss over it. 
[00:25:30]  Good old Plexico Burr's was sentenced yesterday.  He gets two years in prison for the nightclub gun incident.  And I think he's got to do...  20 months.  He's got to do, what, a minimum of 20?  It's a mandatory sentence.  It is mandatory.  So if it's mandatory, why wouldn't it be 24 months, Anthony?  Well, you get good time, they call it.  But if it's mandatory, don't they throw all that out?  No.  Okay.  Certain crimes they do.  But, you know, if you get, like, life without parole, no matter how much good time you got,  you're going to stay in there.  Right.  But a sentence like his, two years. 
[00:26:00]  The sentence is two years mandatory.  And then, you know, you get months knocked off if you're a good boy.  This fucking story.  I know it's mandatory.  It makes me sick.  I know.  This guy's life has just stopped.  Yeah.  And it annoys me because the guy's not a criminal.  He's not a fucking criminal.  He's an upstanding citizen.  He's stupid.  He is dumb, but he's protecting himself because he's a fucking target because he's a celebrity.  Yeah.  It's so...  This guy's got to go to jail for two fucking years for this?  Yeah.  I know. 
[00:26:30]  You want different treatment for a celebrity?  This makes me sick.  He should not have to go to jail for two years.  He's not a fucking crook.  Guys are punching their wives in the face, not going to jail for two years.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, take the celebrity part out of that statement, Jimmy.  Anyone that does that who's an upstanding citizen shouldn't have to go to jail for two years for that.  But I think he's an obvious target.  Like a guy who makes this kind of money...  Athletes get robbed.  Right.  I mean, they just do.  And, you know, the bottom line is he should not be going to fucking jail for two years. 
[00:27:00]  His fucking...  I don't know, man.  It just really bugs me that this guy's life and a healthy career, he's a productive member of society,  is just stop because in this shitty city you can't get a gun permit because of our fucking fruity mayor.  And he was licensed in another state.  He was licensed in Florida.  So he's a responsible gun owner, obviously.  So it's like, I don't know, responsible enough to not have a holster and shoot yourself in a leg.  That was stupid.  That was dumb.  Yeah, you got to kind of holster that shit down there. 
[00:27:30]  All right, that was right.  Hey, you guys agree with Reverend Al?  That's good.  See?  You're going to get along with Reverend Al eventually.  Reverend Al says it's a bit harsh.  I don't think so.  Unusually harsh.  Reverend Al wouldn't have said shit if it was anybody of white ethnicity.  Yeah.  That is...  That mandatory sentence is just bizarre.  And it's based on a constitutional right.  It's just the hottest thing.  It's like you have the right to bear arms.  You ever...  Fuck. 
[00:28:00]  How do they get away with giving you a two-year prison sentence for exercising your number two constitutional right?  And then Bloomberg.  I can't stand my...  I used to love Bloomberg.  I really have started to hate his guts.  Oh, you see how nice the city looks?  He's an elitist shithead.  Yeah, he really is.  You haven't seen all the nice bus lanes and the nice bike lanes and the nice...  Fucking picnic tables where people should be driving.  The one-ton planters all over the place.  Yeah.  The city looks beautiful, Jimmy.  It's fucking so irritating.  It's just irritating.  Actually, it was in Honolulu. 
[00:28:30]  I'd agree with you, but it's New York and there's a winter and it's just going to be fucking creepy at night where cars are not going down.  Yeah.  So stupid.  They'll probably open it to cars at one point.  I don't know.  How?  They got to get rid of all those planters and stuff?  Fucking planters.  What a dope...  They're like...  The planters are close to a ton each.  Massive.  All right.  Robin's calling back.  Should we go back to Robin?  Yes, definitely.  All right.  We're weaving around here.  Robin, what do you got?  So, some people are saying that you might have been touched as a child, Robin. 
[00:29:00]  What do you have to say about that?  I was not touched as a child.  Why?  Too ugly?  Aw.  No.  Well, no.  I've been there and I got, you know...  I think Opie said, quote, you have some nice tits.  Did I see your tits?  Well, you didn't see them, but you said I had nice ones.  I got a picture of Jimmy looking down my fucking shirt.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  I don't remember now.  I do.  I'm going to have to see that picture again.  Where the hell is that?  Where is it?  You got a Facebook?  No, I don't have time for that shit.  I got a job. 
[00:29:30]  You got a J-O-B?  Sorry.  I got a J-O-B in the D.  Wait, she's got a J-O-B in Detroit.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  You got that right.  That's like seeing Bigfoot.  I can't stand the fact that little Jimmy's mad at me.  I love Jimmy.  No, I'm actually not mad at you, Robin.  Yeah, she's like your biggest fan.  She travels from all over just to see you, Jimmy.  I'm not angry, Robin.  I just thought I didn't hear the point.  Jimmy hates you.  I really don't.  You should have heard what Jimmy was saying about you when you were not on the show anymore.  No, I didn't say that.  He wrote down some awful things about you.  How is this page 29 news of, by the way, the post? 
[00:30:00]  What, what?  Plaks ago?  Yeah, Plaks.  No, no.  Mackenzie.  Mackenzie, Papa John raped me.  Page 29?  Well, if it was 1977, it probably would be page one.  That's pretty big, though, dude.  Come on.  A lot of sitcoms have come and gone since one day at a time.  Yeah.  That's true.  If it was somebody from the Seinfeld cast, oh, yeah, that would be front page news.  You know, you got Valerie Bertinelli doing fucking look how much weight I lost off my  ass commercials.  Right.  And you got Mackenzie getting banged by Papa John. 
[00:30:30]  Can I redeem myself now, you guys, so the next time you see my name come up, you don't  not take my call?  Robin, maybe.  Robin, you're one of those calls.  When I see your name up there, I go to you.  Oh.  Okay.  You're one of my regulars.  I don't want to be blacklisted, my friend, but I just, I guess it gets to the point where  the news and everything now, it's like, I'm so fucking tired of hearing people's bullshit  that nobody cares about.  I mean, just because their dad was in the mommas and the papas, people's dads probably 
[00:31:00]  fuck them all the time.  Who cares?  Well, you shouldn't say who cares.  That's kind of a big deal when a father fucks his own kid.  Who cares?  Whether you're famous or just like a deli worker.  Okay, maybe not, maybe not who cares, but.  That's a biggie.  It is a biggie, but I'm so tired of people going on talk shows and having to tell all  their stupid ass, bizarre stories that news just becomes, you know, the next titillating 
[00:31:30]  little story and this will be for a couple weeks and then we can find out who else is  fucking a goat or whatever.  Who cares?  All right.  Thank you, Robin.  And Jimmy, Jimmy.  Yes, Robin?  Read both your books, love them, give them and share them with all my friends.  She's a big fan, Jimmy.  You shouldn't have trashed her so bad.  Why were you so mean to her, Jimmy?  Why were you so mean to her, Jimmy?  I didn't mean to be mean to her.  If she travels everywhere, all right, let's see if she goes online today and buys fucking  free sale tickets for my Boston appearance.  Your Boston appearance?  Oh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, people, all right, everybody's asking me, when am I going to be at Boston? 
[00:32:00]  Hold on, hold on.  In Boston, you got Jersey, you got Kansas City, you got Buffalo, now you got, what's going  on?  It's called, Jimmy's got taxes and bills to pay, but, you know, Jimmy's money had to go  elsewhere this year.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Are you in a bad mood?  No, but it's just, I'm forced to go on the road.  I'll be appearing at the Wilbur Theater.  Damn it!  You shouldn't be forced to go on the road!  Saturday.  I'm in a bad mood.  Saturday.  Fuck!  Oh, hold on.  Saturday, November 28th, I will be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston. 
[00:32:30]  I'm only doing that night.  Saturday, November 28th, two big shows, 7 and 9 o'clock.  Tickets are pre-sale only, starting today at noon.  And this is the fucking worst pre-sale code ever.  What is it?  WT23.  WT23.  That stands for, like, Wilbur Theater 23.  Oh, okay.  But why don't we make the W and the T mean something else?  Well, it's, um, White Titties 23.  White Titties 23. 
[00:33:00]  How about I fuck my father?  All right.  No, that's not WT.  That doesn't make sense, Robin.  Jimmy.  Oh, let Jimmy do the jokes.  Robin's gone.  It's from noon.  Never again will she appear on our show.  24 hours.  Noon today.  Free sale for Boston.  She blew it.  Speaking of Boston, that leads us to the next story.  Um, Mayor Menino won the primary.  Of course he did.  Does he do a good job up there?  Maybe they just like him.  No.  I don't know what that's about. 
[00:33:30]  It's just an awful place with him in charge.  It's, it's.  So, he's that much closer to getting another term.  Another term.  Boy, they do not like changing their politicians up there, do they?  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  One rape at a time.  Oh, one rape.  One rape at a time.  One rape at a time.  Mm-hmm.  Well, this guy does not agree with our Plaxico thing.  Paul in Illinois.  Paul?  Yeah.  Hey. 
[00:34:00]  Paul.  Yes, Paul.  Paul.  I'm there.  I'm sorry.  I don't agree with Jimmy saying he's not a criminal.  He committed crime.  He carried a gun into a nightclub.  The gun was discharged.  They tried to cover it up.  Both of those are felony convictions.  He is a famous athlete.  I will admit that.  And they are trying to make an example out of him.  But he committed crime.  Dude, I understand that.  And I don't even, I couldn't disagree with you in court.  You'd win the argument. 
[00:34:30]  I'm only saying that, like, there's no common sense sometimes.  And to me, Plaxico Barris is not a guy who's a criminal out to hurt people at all.  He did something stupid.  But it was done in a fact, in a way, he was protecting himself with a gun.  He's not going to stick anybody up with a fucking gun.  He's a target.  He obviously cared enough in Florida to get a license.  It's just, to me, this is a guy, because he plays football, he shouldn't have a different set of standards.  But there's no common sense.  This is a guy who clearly has a gun to protect himself.  Clearly.  If he needs protection, why doesn't he go out and get the big entourage? 
[00:35:00]  Well, sometimes you just want to hang by yourself.  And then again, if one of those guys does something stupid, if one of those guys fucking does something stupid, he gets in trouble for that, too.  Yeah, a lot of times those guys do do stupid things.  Do do.  You said.  Do do.  But it made sense.  Of course it did.  Yeah, well, yeah.  I just wanted to share my opinion on it.  I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.  You're getting through.  Paul, we welcome all opinions.  It's all good, my friend.  Yes, we're very tolerant here. 
[00:35:30]  On a positive note, I hope Robin jumps off the damn Ambassador Bridge.  She is the worst excuse for a woman out of Michigan.  No, she's not, Robin.  Robin has been with this show for so many years, I can't even tell you.  She makes Detroit look bad, and wow.  Wow, that is really tough to do.  Our Robin rules.  Thank you, Paul.  You ever go on YouTube or any other sites and just put in, like, Detroit?  Detroit is just completely crumbling.  There is some shit going on in Detroit. 
[00:36:00]  Wowie kazowie.  They are boarding up homes left and fucking right at this point.  Boarded up, burnt out, crackheads, criminals.  Gangs.  It's just there is nothing going on there.  Well, what are they supposed to do at this point with the car industry completely falling apart in Detroit?  Well, if you're still living there somehow.  I would imagine if you don't have a job and you pick up the paper, I don't see how it's possible to get a job. 
[00:36:30]  I'll tell you what you do.  See that area right there?  Mm-hmm.  Whoever lives near there, clean it up.  Get the fuck.  Look at that house.  Who's going to clean up a-  Clean up your fucking house.  Maybe then your neighbor will do the same thing, and then the next one, don't be smoking a crack.  You smoking a crack?  Just clean up your own fucking backyard, then maybe help will come in.  People are too afraid to even come in and help you. 
[00:37:00]  Look at that lovely estate.  These people are just fucking broke, man.  They're just broke.  They're broke up there.  Detroit stinks.  They're broke.  Detroit is broke.  When Leno was doing free, he did a free gig in Detroit.  They are fucked, man.  They are-  Their whole lives were building a stupid car industry.  Yeah.  Figure something out.  Well, they depended on-  They figured, look, we're going to always need cars, right?  That seemed like-  Yeah.  That's a bet anyone would take.  Yeah, we'll always need cars.  To gamble on the car industry. 
[00:37:30]  Like, you know, we're always going to need cars.  Look at that neighborhood.  It's just dilapidated.  It's not-  It's neighborhood after neighborhood, though.  Burnt out.  Those are-  Knocked down buildings.  Those are big houses, too, Ant.  Yeah.  Those aren't little fucking shacks.  Those are probably half-million-dollar homes.  It looks like the, you know, stereotypical war zone.  I don't know.  That looks more like a middle-class neighborhood.  Those are some-  Everything is busted.  All right.  It sucks in the D. 
[00:38:00]  It's so code in the D.  Don in Nevada.  What's up, Don?  Hey, I just wanted to point out, if this guy is such a responsible gun owner, what's he  doing going into a public place with a round in the chamber?  Yeah.  It happens all the time.  Yeah.  I mean, if you don't have a round in the-  I don't realize how many guns with rounds in them are in these clubs, in New York City  especially.  Yeah.  I'm not saying he didn't handle it stupidly.  I'm only saying that, as a society, we're putting guys in jail to protect ourselves and 
[00:38:30]  to protect citizens.  And even though he did something stupid to me, this guy does not have a gun for the purpose  of hurting other people.  It's a legitimate protection device.  How much time-  It's really against the law that's in place in New York City.  I don't like it at all.  I think you should be able to carry concealed.  I agree.  The mandatory laws are stupid.  I think if you have a license-  Yeah.  I carry a revolver on my hip walking down the street.  There's no problem without a permit. 
[00:39:00]  No problem.  Not even concealed.  But not one in the chamber.  If you have a license in Florida, you've got a license in any of the other 49 states,  I think you should be able to cruise into New York and carry your weapon.  Yeah.  I don't think you should be shoving it down the front of your fucking pants like a goddamn  cowboy.  Wear a holster.  Keep that thing concealed.  Don't brandish it.  What was he doing?  You know?  He was fucking up.  And the Supreme Court made a ruling a while back that the police have no responsibility 
[00:39:30]  to protect an individual, and me being a truck driver, it's a felony for me to carry a gun  to protect myself, and it's not the responsibility of the police to protect me.  Where am I?  There you go.  Yeah.  Where are you indeed, sir?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We've got to move on because the phones, everybody wants in.  Yeah, this did happen in Boston.  Jimmy James, a very similar situation.  To what you guys, what Jimmy was just explaining. 
[00:40:00]  Sorry.  Jimmy James, what do you got?  I know.  At first, I was very much against it, plaques to go, you know, getting preferential treatment.  But then I thought back, a couple years back, Paul Pierce was out, you know, with a couple  of his boys just in a nightclub, and some random guy pulled his punk card, stabbed him 13  times.  Yep.  That's a fact.  Just to say, you know.  Paul Pierce.  So, I mean, it's a double-edged sword, you know.  You don't want to give these guys preferential treatment and make them think they're above 
[00:40:30]  the law, but they are indeed targets, like Jimmy said.  And one more thing.  They're showing this fucking video.  On Detroit.  Oops, sorry.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  On the Detroit swag front, I just see opportunity there to open the world headquarters of Ted  Sheckler's glass shop, put and pour him.  Thank you, sir.  Punching out.  There's a YouTube video.  I need Anthony's expertise.  Yes.  A guy throws a basketball.  They're showing it on the screen here. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, right.  He throws it, and it goes in, and right here.  Okay?  I know this is radio.  He's throwing it from the top of the stadium stairs into a net that's on the ground.  I mean, it's possible.  He might have thrown 30.  Yeah.  No, I understand that part of it.  It's possible.  But they're showing it everywhere.  I thought it was a fake video at first, but it's hard to tell on that one.  Oh, here's a very good point on the Plaxico thing, too. 
[00:41:30]  Kelly in Syracuse.  Kelly.  Hey, guys.  The thing that pisses me off most is that Michael Vick hurts and kills hundreds of innocent  dogs, and he's already back and has a million-dollar contract.  And then there's Plaxico, who's just a dope and shoots himself, only hurts himself, and  he's gone for two years.  Yeah, Plaxico is doing more time, I guess, than Michael Vick, right?  How much time did Michael Vick end up doing?  We all forgot already.  Eight days.  What was more?  He did over a year, right? 
[00:42:00]  14 months, I'm thinking?  Yeah.  I believe so.  Not completely positive.  So what do you guys think of that?  Michael Vick got less time than Plaxico.  Is that crazy?  It's a very smart society we have.  He was sentenced to 23 months.  Who?  Vick?  Yeah.  Okay.  So that's a month less than what Plaxico got.  Right.  But he only spent how much time?  Yeah, he did a little over a year.  A little over a year.  He's a guy who, look, I don't care if he did his time in jail.  The guy's a complete slob.  He never should have worked again.  Only because, I know you have a right to earn a living, and I think I've probably gone 
[00:42:30]  against what I'm saying now, but the more I think about Michael Vick, the more that  nobody should have given that fucking piece of shit a dime after he did what he did,  electrocuting them.  He served his time?  He served his time, though.  He should be allowed to live.  I know, but still, he's just a fucking, he's an animal.  Served his time.  Fuck him.  Because that's kind of what happens in radio.  You fuck up.  And all of a sudden, you're blackballed.  You know what I mean?  If you served your time, you should be able to go back to doing it.  I'm not happy about what he did. 
[00:43:00]  I think it's disgusting.  You know?  Yeah.  I don't think he should be blackballed if he did his time.  If a team wants to hire him, then, you know, there's a whole bunch of teams that said,  we ain't, we're not gonna have Michael Vick on this fucking football team.  And that was their choice.  It's like if a guy rapes a child.  And again, that's a much more extreme thing.  Right.  But even if he does his time, what team would hire him?  Well, that is a different kind of a thing.  The recidivism rate of child molesters is like 100%. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  So you're not really gonna be rehabilitated.  Dog killing.  All right.  You gotta slow down.  Michael Vick was not rehabilitated.  Yeah, you know, that guy would fucking do the dog thing tomorrow if he could get away with it.  Let me tell you something, though.  Yeah, if he could get away with it.  But somebody like a child molester, they'll do it knowing they won't get away with it.  Like, that's a whole nother fucking bag of worms. 
[00:44:00]  It was a bad example, but I'm only saying he didn't just do it once.  He did this for a long time, and he did it repeatedly and repeatedly and repeatedly.  And the fucking animal mentality, for you to be able to do that, you get a great life  and a millionaire to be able to torture animals like that.  He's a fucking piece of shit.  Yeah, that's like near serial killer stuff.  Mm-hmm.  I got a home invasion story.  Oh, wait a minute.  Jeremy, North Carolina.  You got something on that basketball video?  Most people have seen it by now.  It's all over YouTube, and now the dumb media is picking it up and playing it everywhere. 
[00:44:30]  Hello?  That was my intro to you, Jeremy.  Go.  Yeah, now it's your turn.  Oh, hey, if you put on second nine of the wide-angle view, the basketball just kind of disappears,  and it doesn't reappear.  So it's a shot where he's standing up, and he throws it, and you're looking down on the field.  Huh.  Wait a second.  If you look at it, the angle of it doesn't even line up with where the hoop is.  And they say, oh, the wind took it or something.  But the ball just disappears. 
[00:45:00]  I got to go with fake, although that shot is makeable if you sit there all day.  All right, let me see.  He throws it.  If you sit there all day and throw this basketball.  Where's the ball?  It is makeable.  The ball's up top.  I could kind of say it.  It's not a basketball, anyway.  It's a smaller ball for him to hold it that way.  It looks like it's like a WNBA ball, which is slightly smaller.  Yeah, there's no way he's palming a real basketball like that.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  This one's tough to figure out. 
[00:45:30]  Like the guy sliding on the slip and slide or whatever and landing in a pool.  Yeah, that's fake.  You know, just looking at it a few times, you realize that it was fake.  But this, I don't know.  What do you think, Ant?  You see the ball the whole time.  No?  Ant, you know video.  You see the ball the whole time, Danny?  Yeah.  It's hard to see the angle with the one cam like that from the ground.  There is two shots.  There's one from the stands and there's one from the field.  And they do sync up pretty well. 
[00:46:00]  And even all the stuff going down on the field, like with people running around, I mean, you  could tell it was definitely shot at the same time.  I mean, it looks...  And the energy going into the basket.  Yeah, I mean, it's coming down pretty hard.  Like that thing kind of shakes.  Did you...  So, like, just these little details.  Did you see the hole-in-one?  The guy who won, I think, a million dollars?  One of those contests?  Really?  Hole-in-fucking-one.  Yeah.  And what did he win?  I think a million dollars and a car. 
[00:46:30]  You know they set that up at, you know, little dumb local tournaments, but no one ever gets  close to the hole-in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This guy fucking put it in the hole.  So, what do you think?  It's tough, right?  The guys who do this have an entire website of just crazy basketball shots.  Oh.  So, I'm going to go with that it's real.  The thing does look like it's going way off to one side and then curves back.  Well, if you throw enough balls, you could kind of figure out the wind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you know the wind's going to push it a little bit.  Honestly, I've played a lot of basketball in my life. 
[00:47:00]  That shot is makeable.  If you put in the time.  I've seen some ridiculous shots.  I mean, what we see is the one shot.  So, we're like, oh, what?  The guy picked up the ball and threw it?  No.  They could have been there all fucking day.  Yeah.  You know?  Let's see all the other shots strung together for an hour of him missing.  And then the video wouldn't be as impressive.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, what do you got?  Boys, how are we doing?  Jimmy.  Happy birthday, sweetheart.  Hi, buddy.  I want to chime in on the Plexco Paris thing. 
[00:47:30]  Uh, Dante Stallworth plays for, he could play for Cincinnati.  He killed someone.  He was high and he ran someone over.  He did 28 days in jail.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really inconsistent.  And I just have gotten such a dislike for Bloomberg because I think he's just a rich  baby who's out of touch and he just wanted to make an example out of this guy.  And it's like, you know what?  Throw some of the pieces of shit from Wall Street.  I mean, we got, we got Bernie Madoff.  Throw some, worry about them.  You know, this guy is not going to go out and fucking pipe some old lady over the head.  He's not going to rob a person. 
[00:48:00]  Remove hats?  Yeah, exactly.  He's not going to do that.  Yeah.  This one bugs me, man.  All right, boys, punch it out.  All right, thank you.  All right, why don't we take our first break?  Speaking of Wall Street, they're making another Wall Street movie, finally.  Oh, no.  But the timing's good.  What black actor's going to be in it?  I don't know.  I don't know many details.  But what African-American actor takes Michael Douglas' role?  No, Michael Douglas is out of jail 14, 15 years later.  The movie starts with him leaving jail. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, it's an extension.  Okay.  Oh.  And it's, oh, I didn't, did I say remake?  No, it's all I'm misunderstanding.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oliver Stone and they've started filming already.  It might be good, actually.  Interesting.  Well, the timing isn't bad, right?  We're all kind of focused on Wall Street and what they've done to the average man lately.  Gordon Gekko gets out of jail.  Yeah.  And that's how it starts, him leaving prison.  Wow.  Rebuilding his empire.  Probably going to, it's probably going to suck.  Yeah, first one was really good.  He never would have done that much time anyway.  What was Wall Street, 87? 
[00:49:00]  I think it was right at the platoon.  I'm going to guess 87?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's definitely late 80s.  He never did 22 years in fucking jail.  No.  Why?  What was his crime?  I don't even remember anymore.  Just insider trading.  Yeah, yeah.  And that was the only part of the movie I didn't like is at the end they got him on tape.  I showed you how to get inside information and the power of it.  It's like, you know, it's like a confession on tape.  Who would do that?  Come on.  That old gag.  Yeah.  Where they confess to the tape recorder.  That is so stupid.  All right.  When we get back, we got a fine home invasion story for Anthony. 
[00:49:30]  Ah!  It's an 88-year-old guy.  Wow.  Was he the invader or the invadee?  That's crazy.  He had to be the invadee.  Really?  That's what I'm thinking.  All right.  We'll have to wait and see.  Oh, wow.  And then I think the stars aligned last night because Larry King, one of our favorites,  interviewed, are you ready for this?  Tyra Banks, one of our favorites.  Take off the wig. 
[00:50:00]  Does it smell under your wig?  Why don't you rub garlic on your scalp?  We should clear the field because this could be really good.  Tyra Banks on Larry King last night.  We have the highlights.  Opie and Anthony.  Rock and roll.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:50:30]  Mike's been waiting a while here.  He's got a home invasion story, which leads to the home invasion story from the news.  Mike?  What up, Mike?  Morning, fellas.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Mike.  Anthony will certainly appreciate this.  A couple of nights ago, back where I live, two young thugs went to a gentleman's house  while wearing ski masks or something of that nature.  Knocked on the door.  And when the homeowner come to the door, they forced their way in, carrying a shotgun. 
[00:51:00]  Oops.  They then proceeded to knock the living shit out of the homeowner, which caused his wife  to come downstairs to see what was going on, at which point in time they demanded jewelries  or valuables or whatever.  The lady told them that if they would leave her husband alone, she would give them the  valuable jewelry upstairs.  So, these jackasses follow this lady upstairs, and they leave the homeowner laying on the  floor downstairs.  Oops.  Oops.  Unfortunately for them, excuse me, the homeowner was a retired police officer. 
[00:51:30]  Ah.  Who then retrieved his own weapon, went upstairs, and successfully shot and killed both robbers.  Fantastic.  Good for him.  That's what I call responsible gun ownership, boy.  Good for him.  Shouldn't have let him in the house in the first place, by the way.  Gotta watch out.  I think the situation was somebody knocked on his door, and he went and see who it was, 
[00:52:00]  and soon as they realized he was at the front door, they kicked it in.  So, you have your gun with you.  Oh.  Good's a gun if you don't have it with you.  That's what I say.  Yeah, I kind of like the guy a while ago that was bitching about carrying a weapon with a  round in the chamber.  Yeah.  There you go.  I don't know about you, but I carry my gun with a round in the chamber.  Well, yeah.  It's just a really cool-looking paperweight, right?  Unless you're a quick-draw McGraw. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Thank you for your story.  All right.  It leads to another home invasion story that has, I think, a nice ending.  We'll find out here.  From the news.  Hunt is on for four suspects who tried to rob a senior citizen in New Jersey.  But as CBS 2's Christine Sloan reports, the feisty 88-year-old fought back and stopped the  thieves from taking his property.  I ran down the stairs.  Are they coming down? 
[00:53:00]  88-year-old Biagio Cicione may have trouble walking.  I just have this theory, man.  Like, you live your whole life.  And if you get to a certain age, you should be able to just live in peace.  Like...  He's being robbed.  Like, it should be, like, I don't know, a death penalty case if you fuck with the elderly.  If you get to a certain age.  Like, you make it to, let's say, 75.  Yeah, they're more burdens, though.  Then it's completely hands-off.  You can't fuck with them whatsoever.  But they're burdens. 
[00:53:30]  They're almost doing a public service.  Biagio Cicione may have trouble walking, but the four thugs who tried to steal his safe  filled with jewelry should have known better than to mess with him.  And then the guy pushed me, and I gave him a sock.  And he just stood there and looked at me.  I said, you want to get some more?  If you don't leave, drop the safe.  The thieves dropped the safe all right and took off running after coming face to face  with this feisty World War II vet on the lawn. 
[00:54:00]  I got my safe.  I got my property.  That's the main thing.  It all happened on Sunday when the Cicions invited a woman claiming to be from a church  into their kitchen.  Since Cicione is in a wheelchair and uses a cane, she must have thought he was a good target.  Oh, my God.  That old scam.  If you're letting people in your house.  Don't let people into your house.  Ever.  Ugh.  Just don't do it.  There was a home invasion recently where a couple of people said that they were, 
[00:54:30]  they had information on Obama's health care plan.  And a person opened the door.  They had pamphlets and everything that they had printed up.  A person opened the door.  Another motherfucker comes from around the corner.  Runs in.  Wends up blasting, killing people.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't even let half my relatives in my house.  Don't let them in.  Why would you let strangers?  Crack the door.  Boy, if the fucking pizza delivery guy only knew it was right behind the door when he fucking  came to the door.  Knocked. 
[00:55:00]  Hello.  Oh, hold on one minute.  Let me get my money.  Here you go.  He gives me the, you know, food.  Then he's gone.  Meanwhile, I'm like fucking, like, that scene in The Godfather 2 with Clemenza and the rug.  When he's standing next to the door.  Remember that scene?  Yeah.  Thank you, Jim.  Oh, Jimmy's mic.  Just thinking what a comfortable way that is to live.  That's wonderful.  He's got a machine gun pointed at the pizza boy. 
[00:55:30]  That's safe.  I never pointed at him.  It's like a pizza.  I just always have it.  It's like a porno.  Then he comes in and fucks you in the face.  You know what?  There's a second part to this story, but Rene in New Orleans has a very good observation.  Rene.  Rene.  How you guys doing?  What's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  How's it going, man?  I love you on Leno.  You're awesome.  It was a decent appearance, but thank you very much.  It was more than fucking decent, and Jimmy's going to be doing a lot of Lenos in the coming 
[00:56:00]  month or two.  So you keep watching that Jay Leno show, which is getting better and better by the day.  I haven't watched one episode.  I don't watch things I'm involved with.  He's definitely finding his rhythm.  Definitely finding.  I mean, you got to realize Leno had three months off, man.  You know, he had to get back into shape.  It's also about sitting there and doing a very different format from before.  But yeah, I'm on three times in October, so I'm very happy.  Three times in October.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second, sir.  Hold on one second. 
[00:56:30]  I wasn't prepared for this, but it's not too late.  Hold on.  So happy to live.  There we go.  We're happy together.  So happy together.  Happy together.  Okay, they're out of sight.  There they go.  Every time the morning mashup walks by our studio, they always walk together, which is the strangest  thing.  As soon as we go to commercial, we go our separate ways big time. 
[00:57:00]  Oh my God.  And sit still.  I run down the hall.  Jimmy, I don't know what the fuck he does, but we all just scatter.  We peel off.  But this morning mashup, every time they go into commercial break, they walk together,  they go to the coffee room together, they walk back down the hall together.  Always together.  Hence, happy together.  They're so happy together.  What do you got?  Nicole walks.  They follow.  They do follow.  They're fucking three stalkers who she works with.  Renee.  So what do you got on the news story? 
[00:57:30]  What I think is great is that because of that news story and now because of you guys putting  it all over the world, thugs everywhere know that Biggio Sicion, 88-year-old feeble bastard and his wife have  a safe full of valuables upstairs.  That is true.  Yeah.  Because I don't think other criminals are going to be like, oh boy, I'm scared.  They do know that the guy is in a wheelchair.  They would just figure out something slightly different.  And the outcome is going to be very, very different.  If he punches me, he's going to be headless in that fucking wheelchair. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, exactly.  There's the news for you.  Now this guy's got to live in fear.  Cole fucking Kane.  Oh, yeah.  Second part of the story.  Sicion wasn't fooled by the distraction in the kitchen.  He walked into the living room, peered out the window, noticed three people walking away with his safe.  When I saw that, I immediately got up like this.  I ran to the door, dropped the cane. 
[00:58:30]  He was messing around with him.  She scratched me.  She made a big mark there with her nails.  She's pulling.  They ripped all my buttons off my shirt, pulling.  And I kept spreading them away from me.  Because of the brawl, police have evidence, including a hair fiber.  Mr. Sicion was excellent in his description of the people.  The Lord was with me, and I have him here with me all the time.  Even though this could have been much worse, this former butcher says he'd fight the thieves all over again. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, well, you just might have that chance.  Because in a week or two, the news is going to forget about him, and everybody else is going to forget.  And then he's just going to be alone watching Jeopardy! with his wife.  And this is going to happen again.  It's going to happen again.  Knock on the door.  Dummy will open it up.  Yeah.  And then he thinks he's got the chops to...  Come for my safe again here.  I'm going to suck you one.  That's right.  Hey, what's that you got there this time?  A gun?  Holy shit.  Hold on, Ed.  They're coming back.  They all have coffee in their hands. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, they go for...  Why don't I send interns?  It's very funny.  There they go.  There they go.  And that's it.  Okay, they're gone.  They're happy together, the morning mashup.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  So there's the 88-year-old man stopping a home invasion.  Those old fucking guys, though, man, they got that weird old guy strength.  Old guy strength and old guy balls.  You ever fight an old guy?  Old guy balls.  It's not easy, man, to fight an old guy.  Especially that guy.  He was down there with the Huns.  Something happens with the ligaments because you don't have muscle anymore.  He probably fucking launched himself out of a foxhole with bayonets affixed and just disemboweled a kraut in his past. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  I think someone's going to take his safe.  Well.  Well, Curt Schilling, as we change gears, heading toward the Tyra audio on Larry King, by the way.  I don't want to hear that so bad.  I was just telling these guys, Curt Schilling, this is how fucked up the media is.  And everyone goes, but you're part of the media.  No.  We're not talking about our part of the media.  Yeah, I guess we are.  We're talking about the news readers.  See, we barely could read on this show. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  When we do try to read a news story, you've heard.  Oh, stutter and mutter and prick.  We suck.  Anyway, Curt Schilling comes out of nowhere and he goes, you know what?  I need some attention.  This is what Curt Schilling was thinking.  I miss my bloody sock days.  Yeah, let's take you inside the story.  Curt Schilling is like, holy shit.  When I'm not throwing a baseball, no one gives a flying fuck about me, Curt Schilling.  So he goes, you know what?  What can I do?  All right.  Well, this Ted Kennedy guy died. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know anything about politics.  I'm just going to make a statement that I'm thinking, the key word, thinking, about trying  to get Ted Kennedy's seat in the Senate.  So then he writes it out.  Then he blogs about it or something.  Knowing these dopey media that, yeah, we're a part of, will pick up the story.  Picks it right up.  So now Boston is just alive with rumors that Curt Schilling is thinking about running for  Ted Kennedy's Senate seat.  Curt Schilling throwing his hat in the ring for Ted Kennedy's. 
[01:02:00]  Right, right, right.  Yeah, is that it?  Yeah.  And then Curt Schilling sits back.  I mean, it's brilliant on his part.  I don't blame him.  He sits back and goes, look at me.  Everyone is paying attention to me, Curt Schilling, again.  And then he waits a couple weeks, knowing that he's got a couple weeks to kind of, you  know, hang with it.  And then Curt Schilling goes, hmm, well, obviously I was never going to run for the  Senate seat.  I don't even fucking know anything about fucking politics.  What do I know?  Pro baseball. 
[01:02:30]  So then he goes back to his blog and goes, well, after considering this for a few weeks,  I have decided not to run for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat.  And now a second barrage of news stories about how he's not running.  This was never a possibility.  Never a story.  But this Curt Schilling just got a lot of attention off and on the last three or four  weeks.  Yeah.  So well played, Mr. Schilling.  Well played.  Well played.  Well played.  Do you think he ever had any intention for real? 
[01:03:00]  What does he fucking know?  He's not a wife of a politician.  Yeah, they know.  They know a little bit.  Tarted.  So there you go.  So that's official.  Curt Schilling will not be.  We knew.  I think we even said when it popped.  This is ridiculous.  Yeah.  And the Beatles selling 2.25 million remastered albums worldwide in the first five days of  fucking release.  Just amazing.  Just fucking amazing. 
[01:03:30]  You know, I haven't bought a Beatles album in, let me think, at least 10 years.  They hooked me in.  I'm going out and getting this fucking remastered stuff.  We sold out.  I know.  Yeah.  I'm getting every single one of these now.  They got me.  And U2's got me, too, because they're doing the remastered thing.  Every one of your favorite bands is going to be doing this.  It's just, yeah.  Another way to just sell CDs that you already have.  They sell you the same product over and over and over again in this new digital age we live  in.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  How many times have you bought the same bunch of things?  Well, see, that's why when you can find music and illegally download it, I'm all for that.  Because the record companies, trust me, they've made their money.  Because you're right.  I mean, my favorite band, one of my favorite bands is like U2.  Not so much these days.  Yeah, you're right.  I've bought different versions of those albums over the years.  Yeah.  How much money are they going to get for the same fucking song for me?  I cannot tell you how many times I bought Star Wars. 
[01:04:30]  There you go.  Another example.  The original Star Wars Episode III.  First, VHS.  Got to have it on the VHS.  And then some special edition VHS.  What about the big fucking laser discs?  Never had it on laser.  Never had it on laser.  That was a bust, huh?  I couldn't afford a laser disc player.  Who could?  Thank God.  It's like a giant DVD. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  I want to hang one from my rear view mirror.  You're so right.  Here's a giant, inconvenient DVD for you.  Right.  And then the DVDs came out, and then the special edition DVDs, and then the box set came out with all three of them.  And then as the newer movies came out, they started re-releasing the other one.  And you realize, I fucking bought this probably eight times.  I would say I bought the original Star Wars eight times. 
[01:05:30]  And this is where it gets fucked up.  Now you, Anthony Comey, let's say you're like just some guy.  Now you decide, I'm going to download it for free.  Yeah.  And then you come a-knocking.  And they pull you out of your home.  I paid my dues.  And they put you in some kind of camp.  Oh, my God.  And beat the shit out of you.  And make you smash rocks for the next ten years because you illegally downloaded it.  Movie theft camp.  Right.  There's your giant-  That's a Laserdisc?  There's your giant DVD. 
[01:06:00]  God, is that silly.  That's really funny.  How much data could that store?  Like nothing?  Boy, they figured that shit out, don't they?  Were they two sides, Laserdisc?  They were, right?  Yeah.  Two sides.  You had to get up in the middle of the movie and flip it over.  I never even got to touch one of those things.  Could someone bring one in so I could just touch it?  A Laserdisc.  I was not in the Laserdisc world whatsoever.  You know how cool someone was when they had that shit, though?  Mm-hmm.  If you went over to someone's house that had a fucking Laserdisc player, like, hey, you  want to watch fucking, you want to watch Stripes on Laserdisc? 
[01:06:30]  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, check it out.  Wow, it's so shiny and space-age looking.  I'm looking at my DVDs lately.  I can't wait for the day.  It's coming sooner than later, where I just throw them all in a box and throw them away.  I don't want the clutter in my house anymore.  Mine are in a box in a closet.  Yeah, because, well, yeah, you guys, you put all your DVDs into your system.  Sure.  Collidescape system.  But we're all going to have that capability where you're not going to need the actual 
[01:07:00]  DVD.  It's a waste of space.  Last night, I'm sitting at the bar, not even in the theater, just sitting at the bar downstairs.  Singing karaoke to yourself?  A little bit of karaoke later on, but-  By yourself?  Oh, yeah, of course.  What song were you singing by yourself?  What the hell was I singing?  Let me think.  Let me think.  I think I was singing a little Jerry Rafferty.  Oh, wait.  I'll guess the song.  Right Down the Line?  Oh, okay.  Is that him?  Or is that the other guy?  Yeah, I think that's him.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  What was his other song? 
[01:07:30]  Baker?  Baker Street?  Baker Street, or was that the other guy?  Who's the other guy?  Boss Gags?  No, I got Jerry Rafferty mixed up with-  Give me a little Jerry Rafferty.  This is a little crazy today.  A little Jerry Rafferty.  Right Down the Line.  Yeah.  Who are you confusing him with?  I know there's another guy I'm confusing him with.  Boss Gags.  I'm thinking of other guys in this genre. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, whatever.  Is there a karaoke version of the house next door to me?  Well, I'm looking for it.  There is a guy that I get confused, though, with Jerry Rafferty.  All right.  Ah, there you go.  Yeah.  You were singing that to yourself?  Of course.  What the hell goes on in your mind? 
[01:08:30]  What the fuck goes on?  A beer-induced moment.  Do you close your eyes even though you're by yourself and just kind of really built it out?  How can I close my eyes?  I got to read the words.  I don't know this song.  Oh, you don't know this one?  No.  You know a lot of these songs.  Well, I know them, but I just don't know, you know, where the words go, so.  Yeah.  You know.  Wait, what was the point?  I'm trying to remember.  So you're at the bar.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm at the bar.  And the TV's there, and I can punch up the kaleidoscape from the TV at the bar. 
[01:09:00]  So I'm just going around, and it's like, I want to watch some Seinfelds.  I don't give a shit that it's not 7 o'clock, and I'm at the mercy of the television stations.  Not so much, though, man.  So just boom, boom, and there it is.  I'm watching whatever episode of Seinfeld I want to watch.  Yeah.  Not so much, though.  The cable companies are figuring all that out, because obviously the DVR thing has been really huge the last few years.  But now we've got the, what do they call it officially?  You're watching a show, and it's 7.15, it starts at 7, and you're like, fuck, and they give you the option. 
[01:09:30]  You want to start this from the beginning.  It's about fucking time.  About fucking time.  But it's one button on the remote where they ask you, do you want to start this show from the beginning?  And it's like, absolutely, I do.  Yeah.  Let's go to the phone.  Say hi to Odie in Washingtonville.  Where's Washingtonville?  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Where's Washingtonville, sir?  It's a Stone Throws away from Manhattan Comedy Club.  A Stone Throws? 
[01:10:00]  Oh, Middletown.  A Stone Throws.  Oh, right.  Yes, where's Van Trazy's place, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  I just saw David Tell there the other, well, a couple weeks ago.  He killed.  What'd you eat before you went?  I'm sorry?  What'd you have for dinner?  Eh, Stones.  Okay.  Ne-me.  Knock it off.  Oh, Jacksonville?  Knock it off.  Anyway, you guys, on the Yahoo top ten list, I got a little something for a little yimmy  there.  Kelly Osbourne had a little poopsie. 
[01:10:30]  What happened?  What happened?  Uh, what happened was, uh, one of those Paris Hilton, uh, little skirt things.  Jerry Rafferty and Gary Wright?  No.  Do bingy bobs.  Uh-huh.  Oh, really?  What happened?  She upped the skirt shop for Kelly?  Something?  Is that what you're doing?  What happened, Odie?  I don't know.  We're trying to figure out the Jerry Rafferty fucking puzzle that...  Yeah, I know.  ...puzzle that...  Yeah.  Sorry I threw that one out there.  We're in a Jerry Rafferty quandary right now.  He does Baker Street, too.  Yeah.  I said Baker Street.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, what happened, Odie? 
[01:11:00]  Hey, guys.  I guess I'll punch you out.  No, no.  We're gonna focus on you.  Hold on.  We're gonna focus on you now.  Kelly Osbourne had a whoopsie out on the, uh...  What happened?  Yeah, it's top ten, uh, one of the Yahoo searches.  Where did she do the oopsie?  Dancing with the Stars?  How the hell would I know?  This guy's got an attitude.  I love it.  Yeah, the fucking ad got an attitude.  How the hell would I know?  I could listen to you.  The fuck are you guys?  You've got the show.  You figure it out.  Well, you might have a point.  You go right ahead. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Chuck fucking show?  Chuck Mangione?  Ah, Chuck Mangione.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, uh...  There's just something that...  And Jerry Rafferty?  I get confused because of that horn thing, I think, or something.  He had one good song, right?  What did Chuck Mangione do?  Um...  Give me a Chuck Mangione-y song.  Uh...  Hit.  What?  What's...  What? 
[01:12:00]  Would you listen to this, Jimmy?  This isn't his big hit.  Is it?  No, this isn't his hit.  Get his hit.  What is his hit, then?  Oh, it's called Start Over on the cable system.  Oh, this is his hit.  Okay.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  There's no words, but there's a horn.  Tootally-doo.  Oh, wait.  Tootally-doo.  Oh, I have a plan of...  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:00]  I've got to say, Ant's playing the slide whistle. 
[01:13:30]  I stopped talking because I was completely amazed that you were actually playing the slide whistle.  Now, if I was doing the slide whistle thing.  Yes.  I would just make the changes with my mouth.  But you were moving the thing to get the different fucks in you.  Oh, I'm trying to keep it.  You were actually playing the fucking thing.  I'm trying to hit it.  Hell yeah.  I'm trying to hit it. 
[01:14:00]  Let's go to DJ.  DJ, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you?  Good evening, bubba boys.  Hi.  Evening.  It wasn't Al Stewart, right?  You're the cat.  No.  I meet you.  And you're going to end up buying Star Wars again on Blu-ray too, by the way.  Just want to throw that out there.  Oh, yeah.  A little Blu-ray action.  Do you need the Blu-ray?  Yeah.  I need the Blu-ray.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you got, DJ?  They're doing it with the CDs, too.  They make you buy seven different versions of the CD with different songs.  But anyway, that's why I called.  Jimmy, I don't know if you called it or not.  Ozzy last night crying on Dancing with the Stars. 
[01:14:30]  What's up with that?  What?  I didn't see it.  What do you mean?  Kelly performed.  I guess she did a pretty good job.  And Sharon and Ozzy were there.  And Ozzy stood up.  Maybe a little tear in his eye.  A little welling up a little bit.  Clapping.  Do we have that?  I didn't see it.  All right.  First of all, DJ, why are you watching?  Dancing with the Stars.  For real.  Hey.  Look, I don't know.  If you don't know how it goes, the West watching, if you're in the room, you got no choice.  I'll be honest.  I tried.  I know.  The show sucks. 
[01:15:00]  It really does.  And it's like the biggest show in America.  Yeah.  Even with Chuck Liddell on this season, I can't watch.  How was Chuck?  I didn't watch, Jimmy.  Mister, how was Chuck?  Why would I know that, Jimmy?  Because you watched the show.  Yeah.  Didn't you watch?  The listeners are fighting back, by the way.  They are fighting back.  Why would I know that, Jimmy?  Like, they've all got bad attitudes now.  That's your fucking job.  Hey, you're a fucking show.  Right.  It's not the O.P., Anthony, and whoever the fuck my name is show. 
[01:15:30]  The fucking DJ show.  I'm just trying to look like I don't watch the show.  Come on, guys.  How are you watching Dance with the Stars and you don't know what Chuck Liddell did?  I at least admitted I'm not watching the show, so I'm out of touch with this one.  You watched it, faggot.  I did watch it, and it was okay.  I mean, I don't think he was the worst one on there.  I'll probably last a couple weeks.  I was too busy watching The Biggest Loser.  That's my faggy show that I'm watching.  Is that the one you're watching?  And I'm fucking all in. 
[01:16:00]  I don't know why I'm all in.  It's so dumb.  I like toddlers in tiaras.  Toddlers in tiaras.  That's a fun one.  Any fucking one of those fashion, actually, kid fashion shows are hysterical.  Of big fat mothers, the overbearing fat mothers, the enabling emasculated fathers, and the dumb, spoiled brat kids or white trash kids.  It's wonderful.  Don't forget the gay dude that they hired to make sure the little baby knows what she's doing on that stage.  When he sings that song at the end of the pageant, I can't believe it. 
[01:16:30]  Look at the little whores they dress.  They dress their kids up like tiny little sluts and parade them around this stage in front of pedophiles.  It is how this is a TV show amazes me.  How this goes on in real life amazes me.  It's fucking disgusting.  It is.  Well, you call it disgusting.  I call it horrible, deplorable.  It really is disgusting.  It's fucking... 
[01:17:00]  It really is.  It really should be banned.  It's a bunch of fucking needing attention, underachieving parents, fucking parading their daughters around in little bikinis.  They should be fucking executed, these adults.  This is the alternative to the mothers putting Drano in the kids' soup.  Yeah.  That's it.  They got this Munchausen syndrome by proxy thing going on.  And another way to release it is to dress your daughter up like a complete whore.  They have them shaking their asses.  They dress them in provocative... 
[01:17:30]  Like, look at this.  This kid should be doing this.  Wait, she's six?  And she's got her leg up in the air.  Other ones dressed even less than that.  They have a bikini segment where they come out in little bathing suits.  And then this guy that could be the most homo of homosexuals comes out and sings a horrible song to these girls.  Gets right in their face.  Yeah.  These pictures are just the worst, dude. 
[01:18:00]  Someone's trying to defend Dancing with the Stars.  Dan.  Dan, what do you got on this Dancing with the Stars?  Dan.  Hey, guys.  It's the main reason to watch Dancing with the Stars for a straight night.  The female professional dancers, especially Cheryl Burke in those little bitty costumes.  Wow.  Yeah, but you've got to watch them dance.  Go on the internet.  You'll find way hotter girls wearing a hell of a lot less.  Yeah, Dan, you've got a whole bunch of them up right now.  Yeah, look at that.  Hey, yeah.  But still, man.  I just, you know.  All right.  You watch for the hot female dancers. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, stop with you, Cheryl Burke.  Who's Cheryl Burke?  I don't know.  Is she one of the Dancing with the Stars?  Why are you getting mad?  We're so angry.  It's unreasonable.  There's unreasonable anger that goes on in this program.  Who is that?  I don't know.  Do we have the Aussie on Dancing with the Stars?  It's not bad.  Let's say hi to Ben in Chicago.  Ben.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Ben.  Hello, sir. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, I got a suggestion with that stupid fucking slide whistle that Anthony does.  You guys should name that tune with that thing.  Like, cut out the music that he plays over with and then try to get what he's actually  trying to play.  That's not a bad idea.  And whoever gets it right gets punched in the fucking face.  That would mean a little extra work for us, though.  Wow.  But not a bad idea.  That's kind of a rough one.  Yeah.  That means we'd have to stay after the show, I'm thinking.  Sounds like a bunch of bunk.  Wow.  Maybe we could record it in the elevator.  Let's see. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  I know it.  March of the Third Reich.  I know the song.  Fuck, you're killing me.  Leave it out there.  Let someone try to figure it out.  Do we have a prize?  Do we have a prize closet yet? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, fuck.  Good job, Kevin from Connecticut.  I got it because of Kevin.  Is it this, Ant? 
[01:20:30]  A few people got it.  I'm looking.  Yes.  That's this, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  Fuck.  What?  I should have known that.  I wouldn't know.  I still don't know.  STP.  Still in Temple Pilots.  Vaseline.  Oh, fuck.  I still don't know it.  You could have played the actual song.  I wouldn't know it.  Dude, get into STP, will you?  I don't know who they are.  I mean, I don't know who they are.  I don't know their songs.  Oh, my God.  They got some great songs.  What's Vaseline sound like?  This is it right here.  Scott Weiland had a seizure on a plane.  When?  And then still appeared in Miami, even though he had this seizure. 
[01:21:00]  How brave of him.  24 hours later.  Yeah, he's a dick, but I still love their music.  Let's go to break with this.  Fuck it.  I've heard this.  I've heard this.  One time a thing occurred to me  What's real and what's for sale 
[01:21:30]  We were kissing, tried to take it home  It's a deal to me  Spread the things that you can't see  Going by the bridge  Somewhere in my son  Two times and it has rendered me  Unstrunk and without veil  Think I'd be safer all alone  Flies in the Vaseline we are 
[01:22:00]  Sometimes it blows my mind  Keep getting stuck here all the time  It's a deal  It's a deal  Search for things  That you can't see  Going on  I don't reach  It's fine  We are so lame  You'll see the look 
[01:22:30]  And you'll see the lies  You'll eat the lies  And you will  And you will  Flies in the Vaseline we are  Sometimes it blows my mind 
[01:23:00]  Keep getting stuck here all the time  It's a deal to me  Search for things that you can't see  Going on  I don't reach  Somewhere in my son  Hope you and Anthony

I do not have sickle cell 
[01:29:00]  Alright  You sure you don't have the sickle cell?  A lot of people were saying it could be the sickle cell  I'm positive  I was feeling better  I left a little early on Monday  Went home and rested up  Then spent Tuesday resting  And throughout Tuesday I started feeling better towards the end of the day  And woke up this morning and said I can do this today  And I came in here and it's been 100% all day  Fucking Alex had a better excuse than clockwork orange for not going to school  A bit of a pain in the gulliver mom  In the gulliver

Where do you want me to cough it up?  Anywhere man  Oh right on that paper  And we know because if it's clear that means  It's got to be a yellowish, grayish, greenish  You guys don't really want me to  Yeah let's go  Right now  That's spit

Sam have you been drinking soda?  I did have Coca-Cola  So that color is Coca-Cola  There's no green or yellow in there  I'm just saying I had a Coca-Cola  So obviously that masks some of it  But I will say  I was very sick yesterday 
[01:30:30]  Make a duty  We'll poke at it and see if it's a sick duty  We'll stick a thermometer into it  We'll just poke at it  Can we take your temperature the old-fashioned way?

Because I was very sick  I didn't even leave the apartment  I was in sweatpants all day  Are you very sick one day  And then not the least bit sick the next day  Because everything I do  I do 100%  So yesterday 100%  Rested up  Getting myself better  You know  Solely focused  Getting better for tomorrow  And that's how I get the job done  It's impossible though  With an illness 
[01:31:30]  That's right  You have to let it run its course  Yeah  It usually takes  I don't know  Close to a week  That's most people though  That's not me  Oh not primetime Sam Roberts  By the way  Watch how sick I am this Friday  Yeah yeah  Boy do I  I got something coming on  Sam's  I think Sam's  I feel it already  Sam's infecting the entire show  I think right now  Yeah Sam  We're going to blame it on you  But I'm starting to feel a little woozy  But it's like  I think I can get through tomorrow though  And I think I can do it  Yeah  I'm hoping  But Friday  I don't know  That's going to be rough  I think  It's going to be rough 
[01:32:00]  I think we all have  I've diagnosed this as  Hoo-hoo-itis  Yeah  Well I guess if you guys  Don't feel up to it  Well I'm not sure  Okay  Is that okay  If you know  I got to look at a seating chart  And then I'll  I'll see how sick  I actually am  I think it's hilarious  You're not even pretending to be sick  You're like  Get me tickets  I'm not coming in Friday  Yeah  I'll be sick  Look if the fucking king  Is going to set the precedent 
[01:32:30]  Then why can't we do a Friday  Here and there  I'll be in Friday by the way  You can do the show  No not the whole show  I'm only doing a little while  With Ace Frehley  If he can't come in tomorrow  I'm going on Friday  And doing Ace  What?  On our channel?  Yeah  I'll just interview him  It'll be 25 minutes  Half hour  20 minutes  So we'll break into  Whatever we're doing Friday?

[01:33:30]  And I mean this company  They're lucky I'm here today  Sam  I'm already feeling  Yeah I'm not feeling  That well today  Really  A little peaked  You can't tell  The show's been great  Thank you Sam  Was that Jimmy?

Even though you were  Fake sick yesterday  I wasn't fake sick  I was actually sick  But Tyra Banks  Real  Was on Larry King 
[01:34:00]  Last night  I know  This is actually  The stars aligning  Two of our favorite idiots  Yeah that is just  Amazing  That is a moron eclipse  Right there  By the way  Everyone wants our prizes  From our prize closets  Should we just give  All those shitty  Prizes away?  To who?  And you may notice  By the way  The list of prizes  Yeah  The one thing  Most of them have in common  Is that at one point  Or another  Somebody was on  Promoting those prizes  Right  Which  Oh really?  Maybe they're a prize closet 
[01:34:30]  And maybe they're  Lopey and Anthony  Didn't take them home  Like they were left here  On the console  When the guests left  I'm kind of getting sick  Of the whole  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  Let's just do it  Not I got it  Let's do it  Yeah  We asked for a prize closet  Two months ago  I'm not gonna yell  I'm not gonna punch anything  But you're not taking care of us  How hard is it  To get some prizes together?  Like prize it  For real?  You know what it is  There is  A magic massager  It looks used 
[01:35:00]  Two speed control  Is it used?  It's not used  Okay  Put it in the prize closet  Add the magic massager  There you go  Can we pile all our prizes up in front of us?  From Adam and Eve  Signature toys  Alright we're gonna pile all our prizes  In front of us here  Yeah put it right up in front of us here  Because maybe it looks more impressive  If we see all of them  You know what I don't understand  There's  There's so many channels  Here at SiriusXM  Yeah  And you would think that each channel  Would have its own  Distinct  Relationship 
[01:35:30]  Yeah  With people  That have something to do with  Maybe the format of the channel  Or whatever  That they could then  Get some prizes  And then share the wealth  A little bit  With everyone  Yeah we want to give stuff out  To good callers and stuff  So like we  We being the Opie and Anthony show  Can get things like  Dildos  Massagers  Things like that  And we could  If somebody need be  Hand it off to another channel  And maybe they can exchange  Something that they have  We could trade our dildo  For some CDs or something 
[01:36:00]  Yes  The only problem is  We only have one  Right Dan?  Well  One magic massager  There might be something else  In the back  That's a plug in one too  Right?  Oh yeah  That's heavy duty  That's for a woman  That really needs to  All right  Sam has brought in  Our prize closet  So  Wow look at this  Yeah it's still  How does a prize closet  Turn into a prize  Fucking shelf  It's a prize  FedEx envelope  Yeah a prize  FedEx envelope  Dude radio  We're supposed to make  Everything bigger than life

[01:52:00]  You know what it is  It's fucking hairstyles change  For the longest time  Black people wore  The afro  The natural  As they called it  Some still do  Some short  Some big and long  Like our own Sam Roberts  That's right  Big afro  And then after a while  People just get tired of it  You know  They put lie in it  And just kind of  Straightened it out  And then after a while  It was like  No this is out of style  Like a mullet would be  You know the mullet  Was completely acceptable 
[01:52:30]  As now it's completely  White trash  But there was a point  Where a lot of people  Had one  Oh yeah  It's like black people hair  It doesn't  Nothing has to  It doesn't always have to  Go back to some pride thing  Where you know  If fucking  The Shirelles  Greased their hair down  And made it straight  It was because of  Some racial thing  And why do you have to be  Accepted by the  Dumb white media  Who cares  Who cares  Stop it  Who gives a shit  Tyra says people  Were racist toward her 
[01:53:00]  Every day of her  Fucking modeling career  Stop it  She made millions  Upon millions  Upon millions  Of dollars as a model  And why didn't she  Speak up at the time  Know why  She liked that money  The money  And she was looked at  Like just a beautiful model  No one really looked at her  And said  Oh she's a beautiful  Black model  She just was hot  Did Larry say this line  Yes he did  Ah  Yes he did  Fuck being serious  I dropped the N-bomb

[01:56:00]  Showstopper  Here comes Larry  Feeling angry about it  You faced it in  Modeling  Most definitely  Every single day  Of my modeling career  I was told I couldn't  Get a job  Or do certain things  Because of the color  Of my skin  Every single day  Even as one of the  Top supermodels  Of the world  I heard that  You were the first  Black on Sports  Illustrated's cover  Yeah  You were the first  Black  The first black  You were the first  Black on the cover  Of Sports Illustrated  Is that true?  I don't think so  Maybe the swimsuit issue  Was it?  Yeah I think you meant  Swimsuit 
[01:56:30]  Yeah  Not just Sports Illustrated  We're probably  It also sounds weird  There are a lot of  Black people on the cover  But just how he said  Black to the first  Black  Yeah  Shouldn't it be like  Woman of  I don't know  Woman of color  Whatever  Black woman  You were the first  Shwoogie  To grace the cover  Of Sports Illustrated  True or not?  Although there'll be  A beep in that one  Huh?  The world  I heard that  You were the first  Black on Sports Illustrated's cover  Right?  Yeah and Victoria's Secret  And a bunch of other stuff  You're the Jackie Robinson 
[01:57:00]  Of female modeling  Oh am I?  Okay  I hereby declare it  Okay  Shut up  He's the Jackie  Ass of CNN  You can't compare Tyra  To Jackie Robinson  Are you nuts?  Sure you can  You know what  Jackie Robinson  Did for the fucking world  For this country?  What did Tyra do?  Except show her tits  He had more hair  Than Tyra  Tyra does it bother you? 
[01:57:30]  You have hair  Like the black leader  Of the Republican Party  Whose name I can't remember  Richard Steele  Is it Richard Steele?  He's hailing Richard Steele  Larry's checking in  Anthony  Oh really?  Yes Larry  Yes hello  Hi Larry  Larry  Hey how's it going?  Good  Just wondering  Hey Tyra  Can you actually buy  Weaves  With food stamps?  Oh  Oh Larry  That's stereotypical  He didn't say this 
[01:58:00]  Andrew  Go ahead Andrew  Andrew  I don't know if you guys  Caught it  But after  Tyra told him  That black lady  Spits non-billion dollars  In hair products  He said  Personally  He didn't say that  Did he?  Personally  Do you?  I just  Use every night  Whether I need it or not  I shampoo with  Welch's grape juice  And condition with  A little garlic  It's wonderful  I love that it always  Goes back to the garlic  I don't know why 
[01:58:30]  Garlic  Just working it  To every Larry  Of course  I don't even know  If he's promoted that  In the last ten years  Aren't you glad  You don't have  A Gorbachev birthmark  On your head?  Let me  Is it hard  Being a black woman  With a hairline  Like Patrick Stewart?  Go  That fucking  Bald head is hilarious  You're not going to  Believe this  But Larry King's  Checking in  Oh my god  He calls a lot  Larry  Gentlemen 
[01:59:00]  How are you?  Hi Larry  Love the show  Love you guys  Tyra  Do black breasts  Have a different texture?  Now  Your breasts  Are very prominent  On the  Sports Illustrated  Which you were  The first  Colored woman  On  Are black breasts  Different?  Go  We'll be taking  Your calls  For black breasts  Are they different?  How accurate  Was Mississippi burning? 
[01:59:30]  Go  And it's Michael Steele  Not Richard Steele  Ah right  Oops  Oops  When a model  Is a supermodel  Let's say  Sports Illustrated  Bathing suit  Tyra Banks  Does it sell  The suit?  As a model  You are  Oh my god  Larry  What?  Does it sell  The suit? 
[02:00:00]  I asked the hard  Hitting question  What do you think  Larry?  It's fucking  Does it bother you  That Anakin Skywalker  Had more hair  When the helmet  Came off?  Yes  Who sold  More bathing suits?  You or  Kathy Bates?  Go  Fucking  Blithering idiot  He is an idiot  Let's sell  The suit  As a model  You are  Selling the outfit  And I do  Think that 
[02:00:30]  Supermodels  The reason  Why they're  Paid so much  Is because  They move  The product  More  So  When  Really  This is  Hard hitting  Journalism  Is that why  They get paid  More?  Because they  Help sell  More stuff?  You sell  Stuff as a  Model  That's  Interesting  And people  Just sit  At home  And watch  This shit  Fascinating  Care about  What she's  Saying  Is it true  You're endorsing  Rogaine?  Comment  Comment  You bald  Bitch  Anthony

[02:02:00]  Real fast  Anthony  We got Larry King  Checking in  Larry  Larry  Tyra  Is it true  If you don't  Dry your hair  You come out  Looking like  The picture  Over Scatman  Carona's bed  In The Shining  This should be  Jimmy the Greek  But it looks like  It's Larry King  Anthony  Larry King  Checking in  Yes Larry  Tyra  Tell me about  The extra muscle  In your leg  Ah  That's Jimmy the Greek's line 
[02:02:30]  See we do it in character  In character  Like Mr. Amos  Move the product more  So  They absolutely  Check that  They know that  I know that  When I was on  When I was a  Contracted  Victoria's Secret  Model for ten years  That the reason why  They paid me  What they paid me  Was because  I moved the product  If it was on me  It would sell more  Than if it was on  Somebody else  Ten years  She's a Gloria  Victoria's Secret  Model  They paid her  A shitload of money  Yet she was 
[02:03:00]  Just bitching  About racism  And not being able  Not getting word  Having a deal with  Racism every day  Hold the phone  You were the fucking  The girl  She was the biggest  Model in the world  For a while  For many years  Supermodel  What the fuck  Is she talking about  Supermodel  We got one more  Tyra on Larry King  That position  How does that show  We had Twiggy  Janet Dickinson  Why is that show  So successful  I think it's successful  Because it pulls back  The curtain  On a world  That seems so  Intimidating  A world that people 
[02:03:30]  Thought was vapid  A job that people  Thought took  Absolutely no skill  And we showed  The world  That it is  You're right  It is a skill  I think it's also  Popular because  I have made sure  That I do not have  Just stereotypical beauty  On the show  It's my  It's my passion  In life  It is  One of the reasons  Why I feel like  I was put here  Is to redefine beauty  To open up the doors  So I feel like  I have struck gold  And I have reached  My goal  When young girls  Are looking at 
[02:04:00]  Top model  Going  She can model  If she can model  I can model  She turns back  For a second  If she can model  I can model  That's the biggest  False statement  I've ever heard  In my life  I have actually  Watched this show  A little bit  Here and there  And every girl  On that show  Is a hot piece  Of ass  Yeah they got  That model  With the perfect  Model body  Yeah  Meaning tall  And slender  Tall skinny  They were sometimes  Shut the fuck up  They'll bring in  One to two fat girls  That are always  Voted off  Within the first  Three or four weeks  But they're there

[02:19:30]  And remarries her  Oh my god  That could happen  Oh my god  In what  Galaxy  How does that  Would you have to be in  That that happens  Do you be unhappy doing that  Oh  What  What  You wouldn't want to do that  I don't know  I wasn't around for those days  You weren't around at all  For those days  No no  I met  As it was breaking up  When I met Andy  It was dating Linda  That's when I first met you  You guys were together  Yeah  I never saw you  Picture  Picture  Just  Your unhappiest times  Of your life  Hold on 
[02:20:00]  All right  Oh no  Jimmy's watering  And that's  Like where I was  So  The idea of going through that  It was never  Never  No way  Not now  Not never  Do you know what sad time I pictured  Uh oh  One time when I was a boy  I had ice cream  Yeah  And I jumped up and down  And yelled  Yay ice cream  And it fell to the ground  Is that true  Did that really happen  I think it's happened to all of us 
[02:20:30]  Yeah  Cause that's very sad for a child  And then the ants just take over immediately  They just come out of nowhere  To eat your treat  I hated missing the ice cream man  I was holding the cone  And in a boy's eagerness  I jumped up and down  Violently screaming  Yay ice cream  Squeezing the cone  And it bubbled over  And fell onto the ground  Jimmy you're covering up  Into crushed glass  That wasn't a cone  And it wasn't ice cream  Dribbling up  Was it  It was the ice cream man  He made you stick your hand 
[02:21:00]  Through the  Dragon face garbage thing  He just ran out of ice cream  If you don't mean  You grabbed the cone kid  Put your hand in the dragon's mouth  And it was his fucking puckering anus  Dragon's mouth smells like doody mister  Why does the dragon's mouth  Have poop on it  One time the ice cream man  Made me open my mouth  Outside the dragon  Oh it was terrible 
[02:21:30]  I was expecting treats  What did you get?  I don't know  But it tasted salty  It made me upset  I went home with a metallic taste  In my mouth  Jesus  Chlorine push up  I didn't like that  Chlorine push up  Poor Ted  I know  Ted was raped everywhere  Oh he's just molested by everybody  Poor kid  Plump buttocks  No wonder he's so fucked up  We got an ETA on Michael Moore  What is he promoting Sam?  I don't know much about this  Capitalism 
[02:22:00]  A love story  Capitalism  A love story  Now Opie you saw this film  Give me a little briefing  Capitalism is bad  Capitalism is bad  Michael Moore yells at buildings  Through a megaphone  Yells at buildings  Through a megaphone  And he puts crime scene tape  Around all of Wall Street  Because there's crimes  Being committed in there  Because there's crimes  Right  All right  Now is there any part  Of capitalism  He finds good  And praises in this movie 
[02:22:30]  Yeah  The people that  Use their hard earned money  To go see this movie  Oh is that it  Yeah  That he's going to profit off  Ookie dook  He just thinks that  We don't have a lot of capitalism  Left in this country  What do you mean?  What is he talking about?  He's helping out the common man  The average worker  But  It's the workers  Against the employer  How?  Well they get the big bonuses  And you're getting shit  I don't get it 
[02:23:00]  I don't disagree with him now  You have to ask him  For yourself man  The fuck  Eh  What else?  Ask me more questions  This is fun  Um  About the movie  Okay  What  What is the main problems  He has with these  Corporate entities  Somebody wasn't paying attention  Well the lady next to me  Was drinking 
[02:23:30]  And she was snoring  That's true  That was supposed to be  Jimmy's seat  Fucker didn't go with me  I was sleeping  I didn't feel good  What is what?  Like what's the biggest problem  He has with these companies  Like why is he there  With bullhorns  And what not  Because they're getting  Big bonuses  So is he for the bonuses?  Yeah he likes it  No he doesn't like the bonuses  He likes the um  Did you see the movie  Or the trailer?  Get someone  Can you call on someone else?  I'm getting really hot 
[02:24:00]  Why?  I feel like this is like  School again  Alright ask me another question  I'm pretty good at this  Okay  Um  Does he feel socialism  Will be better  And if so why?  Very very good  Do you talk about socialism  As being a positive  Alternative?  Um  Um  Maybe  Oh he did point out that  Um  Japan and Germany  Takes care of their people 
[02:24:30]  Yeah well  Look how they took care  Of their people in the 40s  And they all have  Health care  And good jobs  And stuff  The only reason they can  Do that is because  Of us bailing them out  After the war  I think  We didn't just leave them  As a conquered nation  We built them up  Yeah  We wrote their  Probably uh  Bill of rights  We wrote their  Actual bill of rights  And it worked out  Really well for their  Countries  And  Yeah  And Michael Moore  Makes the point  Like wow  We write bill of rights  For other countries 
[02:25:00]  That worked out well  But we don't really  Take care of the citizens  Of this country  Well maybe it's because  Those countries  Don't have assholes  That are undermining  The system  As much as we do  Alright  Also they were  Conquered nations  They were both in a position  To be fucking  They both just  Started world wars  They didn't have a pot  To piss in  Or a window  To throw it at  That's right  I'll tell you that  He also hints at  The downfall  Of this country  Because there was  Like a montage  In the beginning  From an old movie 
[02:25:30]  Yeah  And then he like  Dubbed in words  When Jesus was talking  I remember that part  What?  Yeah Jesus  Like you know  When the lepers  And stuff come  And Jesus like  Heals them  Yes  Well the Jesus  In the movie  Which was an old movie  But he redubbed  He said well  My son  You're gonna have to  Pay out of pocket  What do you mean  It was like  A healthcare joke  What does that mean?  Well cause that's  What happens now  And if that was  Happening in Jesus' time  He wouldn't care about 
[02:26:00]  Like healing the sick  He would be like  You would have to  Pay out of pocket  Oh  So he was making  Healthcare jokes  Through the words  Of Jesus  Through Jesus  Jesus  I call him Jesus  Jesus  And then I don't know  There was a lot of  Houses being boarded up  I remember that part  Of the movie  Yeah  Yeah foreclosures  And what not  Well that's happening  All over  And they actually  Economy  They actually have  A video of  A family  In their house  As the sheriffs  Arrive to  Kick them out of 
[02:26:30]  Their house  And they're just  Sitting there  All depressed  In the living room  Yeah  Behind locked doors  And they didn't  Make it easy  For the sheriffs  And then the sheriffs  Bust in  And there's video  Cameras in their face  That's kind of  How the movie  Started  Give me another  Question about it  Who was the  Second unit director  What's his  What's his take  On the whole  Healthcare thing 
[02:27:00]  Did he get into that  I know that was  His last movie  Sicko  But was it more  Maybe  He wants  He  Like  Like  Like  He  He wants  Affordable  Healthcare for  Every American  Yeah  Alright  That's good  Okay  I think I'll just  Read the bio  Roger 
[02:27:30]  Me  What grade  Would he give me  For real  For real  I would get a  Passing grade  At least  Right  Yeah  You'd get a B  I'd get a B  Yeah  Nice  I'll be honest  I didn't really  Like this movie  That much  There you go  His other movies  I like  His movies  I liked a lot better  Should have said 
[02:28:00]  He's overweight  On it too  Huh  Well  Are we ready now  Why  Is he coming in  What  Someone wants to  Praise me  Just like Jesus  Got praised  Butch  Hey how's it going  Hey  What's up guys  How's it  Jimmy  Hey  And you know  Last week I'm listening  And somebody did  On the cyber shop  Said Opie  Say something funny  Yeah  You know  Do something funny  And it kind of pissed me off  Because I don't 
[02:28:30]  Why I told you  My contract says  I only have to be funny  Once a month  And if I'm funny  More than once a month  I get bonuses  Wow  Funny bonuses  Damn it  Bonus for the extra funny  Great  Now I just  The point I wanted to make  Is that people actually  Look at the dynamic  Of your group out there  They need you  You're steering the ship  Yeah  These other guys  Are just throwing in  The funny stuff  When necessary  I gotta say  My favorite  Combination  Of you guys  Is  Is 
[02:29:00]  You know  My favorite  Combination  Is  ONA  And Jimmy  And Patrice  The four of you guys  Are out there  Man  That's a good combo  I had to pull over  Ten times  Because I've been laughing  Alright  Thank you  Yeah I do that  All the time  Where's Michael Moore  We really need  Mr. Moore  In studio now  He's not  He's not  At the other place  I thought they said  He was  He left  Well I mean  He's done  So we sit here  And do what Sam  You have any ideas  Come on  Did you hear about  Rampage Jackson  Oh you know what 
[02:29:30]  I did not actually  Rampage Jackson  And fucking  I tweeted it  Because someone  You know  Gave it to me  And I gave credit  Where credit was due  And then everyone's  Yelling at me  Like that's bullshit  But I guess  Rampage Jackson  Is quitting the MMA  To concentrate on acting  I think he got cast  To be in the new  A-Team movie  Right  Really  Well he got cast  In the A-Team movie  That's a dick move  Because Dana White  We should get Dana White  On the phone  And we like Rampage  A lot  He's done great radio  For us  But he's put us  In a tough spot here  Rampage 
[02:30:00]  Like you know  Had that incident  And Dana White  Was right there for him  And gave him another  You know a second chance  And allowed him  To come back like this  And now Rampage  Is walking away  Well he posted a blog  Because he took  The A-Team movie  And he was supposed  To fight Rashad Evans  After this season  Of The Ultimate Fighter  Right  Have they filmed it  Or no  The fight  The Ultimate Fighter season  It started  Yes  But this movie  Is going to be filming  While that fight 
[02:30:30]  Was supposed to happen  So he was like  You're going to have  To delay the fight  And Dana White  Said a whole bunch  Of negative stuff  About him doing  The movie online  And so I guess  First they made up  But then Rampage  Posted this blog  Last night  That he got his  Feelings hurt  That you know  Dana shouldn't  Treat him this way  And that he feels  Like he was  More  He has been more  Loyal to the UFC  Than the UFC  Has been to him  So he's done fighting  I wonder  On some level  Because him and Rashad  Don't like each other  Yeah 
[02:31:00]  I wonder if he's  Worried about fighting  Rashad Evans  Well he said  He's  One of the things  He said in the blog  Was that  He was supposed  To fight Machida  After this season  Of The Ultimate Fighter  Even though the coaches  Always fight  He said in this blog  That when he agreed  To do this season  Of The Ultimate Fighter  Dana said  You don't have to  Fight Rashad  Because it's a  Different deal  This time  And then  He says  That after  After he signed up  To do the season  And Rashad did  Dana went back  And said  No you do have  To fight him  Well you seem  Well informed  About this 
[02:31:30]  But I mean  We're friends  With Dana  Can we get him  On the phone  Today  After the Michael  Moore interview  That would be  A Carleese  Thing to do  Yeah  Let's try to get him  Who's he  He's the one  With the phone number  With the S on his shirt  Oh that guy  Yes  So that's  That's big news  Today  Yes  And also  I have to get  My other shirt  Act of it  By the way  A lot of people  Don't like Michael  Moore  Does Michael  Moore still live 
[02:32:00]  In Traverse  City Michigan  No  Come on  What  Maybe he has  Residence there  I'm not sure  Is that Michael  Moore  No because  Traverse  He lost a lot  Of weight  Because Traverse  City Michigan  He has security  I'm looking at  The demographic  Yeah  It is 96% white  .65% black  And 3.35% other  Oh so he picked  A very safe white  96% white neighborhood  Right  But maybe he still  Goes to Flint  Officially that would be  Considered a very safe 
[02:32:30]  Neighborhood right  That is  Safer than mine  The median income  Per household  In that city  Is $37,330  And the median income  For a family  Was $46,912  You know what  He won me over  With Sicko  I never liked  Michael Moore  But until Sicko  I really did like Sicko  Even if there were facts 
[02:33:00]  That people would debate  I'm sure there are  But the basic message  Of it I did agree with  Is that it kind of  Does bother me  That we have so much money  And people are not  Taken care of  Fuck that  I'm just saying  This guy  Is living in an area  Where he can feel  Safe and sound  You're yelling  At an FTC  Based on  Wait for him to get in here  Oh I'll tell him this  Based on  The very concept  That he bashes  In this film  Capitalism 
[02:33:30]  His ability  To make a product  His film  Sell it  And reap the rewards  Financially  For that product  So what's wrong  With fucking capitalism  See what he says  What's wrong with that  I want to see what he says  I want to see what you say  Is that an opening  Questionant  You say who now what  Is that an opening statement  Oh I have no idea  I just babble out my ass  Most of the time on this show  I agree with you  Jimmy  I just  I don't know  I think they could find  The money somewhere else  Instead of continuing  To take it out of our pockets 
[02:34:00]  Dude I'm 100% agree  And whether it's a Democrat  Or a Republican  I'm not even going  With party lines  I'm sick of them  Trying to get more money  Out of us  You know  There's got to be  Other places  They can get the money  At this point  I completely agree  I don't want my money taken  And that's where  I do agree with Anthony  But you know  But I do want to see  People taken care of  In this country  Absolutely  Because I see my  My own family suffering  With this shit  But then it's like  Alright we solve the problem  By taking more money  From people  And look  You know  In the end  Whatever Obama takes  From my fucking back pocket  I'll be fine 
[02:34:30]  And barely notice it  That is a fact  What?  I won't be happy about it  But  I have plenty of fucking money  But barely notice it?  I will barely notice it  That's how I live  I will barely notice it  You could barely notice  Half your money going away  I'm  Yeah  It's already half  That's what I mean  It's going to go up  Another what?  Percent?  2%?  Do you barely notice half?  It sucks  I mean  It's at a point  Where it does matter  Hold on a minute  I know we're in the middle  Of a huge discussion  Hold on  But hold on  One fucking minute  Will ya? 
[02:35:00]  That big linebacker  Just blocks her  And they have  Turn the corner  Alright  Yeah I think that we should  Just stop  That's a morning mashup  And you know  They walk around together  So now we play  Their happy together song 
[02:35:30]  When they walk by our studio  Just so you're in on the bit  Yes  Stop giving money  To other countries  And use that money  To take care of citizens  Find the money somewhere else  Yeah stop fucking  Take the money you're wasting  And give it to other countries  And just take care of people here  I'm more worried about  The people that would  Yeah it would really affect  With the government  Taking more money from them  You're just looking  At the surface  Of this whole thing  And not the  Deeper impact  That a  Nationalized  Health care system  Would have 
[02:36:00]  So you pay  For these people  That don't have insurance  It cuts down  On  The competition  It  At some point  Makes everybody  Sign on board  For this  National  Health care  But the point is  I'm not happy  He's taking it  From my pocket  In the end  I'll be fine  I want him  And the government  To find the money  Somewhere else  And they said  You'll be able  To have a choice  That's my whole point  You won't be forced 
[02:36:30]  To use doctors  Because personally  But you know something  You'll have a choice  Here's the choice  That you'll be given  You can  Keep what you have  Or  You can  Have nationalized  Health care  Which  Is in essence  Free  Paid for by the  Taxpayers  So a lot of people  Defect over to that side  And you get  Lower quality  Health care  Because the doctors  Are no longer  Making the money  They were making  It's just  It's a ripple  In the water  It's like  Like I'm saying  About  Just don't take it  From me  You know what I mean 
[02:37:00]  Just take the money  But just not  From taxpayers  I'm done with the government  Taking money from me  For real  But I mean  I'm talking about  The people that are  Making $100,000 a year  You know  They will be  Really affected  By this shit  I don't worry  About the common man  Because it affects  My brothers and sisters  Personally  I don't think  If the government  Helps people  Who can't afford  Health care  That all of a sudden  The doctor care  Is going to suck dick  I think there's a way  To balance it  Where people can choose it  If they want  Slippery slope  You know  Yeah but it's worth it  I mean  I don't like to see people  Who really are having  A hard time  15% of the country 
[02:37:30]  It's just  It's a lot of people  Sorry  That's a lot of people  There's fucking  Homeless people too  What are you going  To do about them  There's a difference  Between somebody  Abusing themselves  What are you going  To do about them  Illegal aliens  Are different  Illegal aliens  Are different  Maybe not as far  As this bill is concerned  But I'm talking about  Hey hook them up too  I don't want to hook them up  But I do want  Citizens taken care of  Not  You know  But for basic medical care  It's disgusting  That the insurance companies  Are the ones that dictate  And they're fucking animals  And we let these vultures 
[02:38:00]  These bloodless vultures  15% of the people  Can't afford it  It's fucking expensive  You know the insurance companies  Are claiming  They make a 1% profit  1%  I don't care what they claim  Of all their premiums  I don't know if I believe them  I'd like to see  An assessment of that  And I'm working on that  As we speak  But  Let's be nice to Michael Moore  By the way  Because I guess  We're listed prominently  On his website  Prominently  He's a fan of ours  So let's agree with  Everything he has to say  Oh right 
[02:38:30]  But I just like  The basic theme  Of what he said  In Sicko  It really did win me over  I'd never liked him before  But it did win me over  In that  You know  It's like  It just  It does bug me  My father was at work  It just fucking stinks  Oh my god  Did he mention us  Before Howard Stern  Howard's gonna blow a gasket  Oh boy  Who's he gonna yell at  For that one  No that's gotta be  The last thing  Like that's the end as  He got the end as spot  You know  What happened 
[02:39:00]  What  What he wrote  I thought you were  Michael Moore for a second  Oh  Jesus  I was gonna say  Michael a lot more  Oh goodness gracious  Is he doing another show  Or is he just coming in  You  Oh good  Okay  Yeah that looks like him  That looks like Michael Moore  Walk him in  We'll just  Yeah  I'm coming  Hi  I like the fact you said  Hi before you got in  Michael Moore  No I was  I was saying hi  Out the window  That is Michael Moore 
[02:39:30]  Live on the O.B. Anthony show  Capitalism  A love story  How are you sir  What's going on in the hall  Out here  I mean those people  Used to be in offices  And now  You just  Their desks are out in the hall  It's all these cuts  All the cuts  That have gone on  The merger  I mean seriously  People  You can't see this here  But  It looks like a sweatshop  Out there  No offices anymore  It is  Actually there are young  Asian children  Sewing shirts  For J.C. Penney  Right around the corner  Can you do a documentary  On that radio show 
[02:40:00]  Is it get fucked  In a merger  That would be a good one  That should be  Your next project  We met you  At some Beatles thing  A few years back  I don't know if you remember  I was at Hard Rock  That's right  I forgot what it was  It was the anniversary  Of the Beatles  Being on Ed Sullivan  It was the 40th anniversary  I thought it was  The Pete Best  Got fucked party  We were out of work  I think at that point  Yeah we were  I think you had gone  To confession  For your sins  Or something like that  Something bad  Had happened  But now 
[02:40:30]  I want to get right  Into the movie here  A capitalism  A love story  Yes  And now obviously  You're very sarcastic  With your titles  What is this about  It's a love story  It's about the rich  Who love their money  Except the twist now  Is they love our money too  And they want it  Now do you  Do you actually see that  As the rich  Loving their money  Now is there a problem  With the rich  Loving their money  That seems to me  To be the American dream  You make the money 
[02:41:00]  You get to keep it  It's part of capitalism  Which you know  A love story  But you make money  You're able to keep it  It's nice  Unfortunately  I think more so  The government  Loves our money  I think  No  Actually  That's not what's  Happened  Really  First of all  The American dream  Is not about  Loving your money  The American dream  Is being able  To work hard  And then get paid  A good wage  For working hard  And with that  Good wage  Raise a family  Be able to  Buy your own home 
[02:41:30]  Send the kids  To college  And have something  There for yourself  When you retire  That is the American dream  But now  The new American dream  Is you work hard  The company prospers  And you lose your job  And so a lot of people  Are very cynical  About this now  And unfortunately  A lot of people  Just sort of  Checked out  From the system  Because they think  Well what's the use  You know  They're all lying to me  And you know  Now I'll never deny  The fact that there  Are plenty of corporations  With corporate CEOs  And what not  That are just  Despicable asses 
[02:42:00]  That I mean really  They rape their employees  But your comment earlier  Though on the American dream  I see that  Obviously yes  The American dream  But I don't see  This need to suffer  And the worrying part of it  Even people that are  Getting by  I don't see this need  To sit there  And go  Let me balance  A checkbook  And see that  If you can achieve  A place in this country  Where you are wealthy  You are now  Villainized  You are a villain 
[02:42:30]  In this nation  Because you have  Achieved  More of the American dream  And you are looked at  And how did you achieve it  It's because  How they achieved it  And it's not just  Because they're wealthy  None of us would  Disparage anyone  Who works hard  For their money  Or you know  I want the brain  Surgeon to be paid a lot  I don't want a guy  Working on me  Where he can make  Taco Bell wages  Very good  But in my movie  I show you  Airline pilots  Who I interview  Yeah Ope was telling me  About that  Who are paid  16 to 20 thousand dollars 
[02:43:00]  A year  They've got second jobs  They have food stamps  They walk dogs  And they're  And they give blood  Plasma to make extra money  Oh that's right  I forgot that point  And they're all woozy  They're flying  And they're flying  30,000 feet  You know  But these are people  Who work for Delta  United  American  These aren't little  Tiny operations here  And it's just  I think if people  Realized  Just how  Well I think people  Actually do realize  Because most people  In the last decade  Have been asked  To give back  Cut your benefits  Cut your days off 
[02:43:30]  Cut your wages  Or cut you  And we now have  Unemployment of  Officially about 10%  It's probably unofficially  Closer to 20%  And if you notice  In the last few months  As the unemployment rate  Has gone up  So has the Dow Jones  The stock market  Has recovered  Because Wall Street  Loves it  When people lose  Their jobs  Now why would that be  Because  And this is  Stupid thinking  It's short term thinking  Short term it means  What's the biggest  Expense here  Your employees  Always  In any business  Is the employees 
[02:44:00]  So when you say  I'm going to save money  By getting rid of  These people  And I'll make  The remaining people  Work twice as hard  Or out in the hallway  In this case  You know  Then you  The Wall Street goes  Oh wow  The bottom line  Is going to look good  This quarter  And it does  It looks really good  But in the long term  If you lay  All these people off  Who's going to buy  The cars  Who's going to buy  The big screen TVs  Who's going to  You know  Buy these things  That are supposed  To put other people  To work making them  I understand that 
[02:44:30]  But does it  Always have to be  Based on this  Corporate greed  And could it  Ever be blamed on  You are so  Rodney King on this  Aren't you  Can't we all  Just get along  Why do we always  Have to blame  The rich guy  No no  I'm just saying  Can it ever be  Blamed on  Economic  Just your basic  Over the years  The ups and downs  Of the economy  We're obviously  In a low  Does it have to  Do you have to  Stick the blame  On a company  CEO  Someone  Yes  Because  Yes 
[02:45:00]  Because the greed  Of the last decade  All they've done  Is focus on  How to make money  Off money  How to move money  Around  Then take bets  On the money  Then take bets  On the bets  Then take out  Insurance on the bets  That's how they've  Been building up  This sort of  Illusion  Of wealth  And instead  What they could  Have been doing  During this time  Is old school way  Let's make things  Let's come up  With the next  Light bulb  Let's come up  With the next  Internet  And when we do  We put people  To work  And then  And then  We will reward  You for having 
[02:45:30]  Done that  If you give  A thousand people  Jobs  I want you  To be paid  Well for that  You know  But that's not  What these guys  Are doing  Down on Wall Street  You don't see a huge  Jump in the  Technology sector  In the past decade  I mean I think  It's been  Giant leaps and  Bounds  If we hadn't  Had that  I want  Seriously  Considering what  Happened after the  80s  And the  Deindustrialization  Of this country  Closing these  Factories  What would have  Happened  Had we  Not  But what I'm  Saying is  That was the  90s  What you're  Talking about  That was that  Great boom  And into the  First part of 
[02:46:00]  This decade  But now  We're in this  Really bad  Recession  In some states  Like where I'm  From in Michigan  It's a depression  Because the  Unemployment rate  Is 20%  What do we  Need right now  To pull ourselves  Out of it  Well we need  The next great  Thing  Where is it  How are we  Going to get it  Because Wall  Street has  Sucked up our  Best minds  The number  One job  That kids  Take when  They graduate  From Harvard  MIT  Duke  All the top  Schools  Number one  Job  Finance  Finance  So Wall 
[02:46:30]  Street is  Hiring not  People who  Graduate with  An economics  Degree or  Business degree  They are  Hiring our  Top physicists  Mathematicians  Engineers  The people  The scientists  The people  That we need  To find  The cure  For cancer  Or to build  That bullet  Train that can  Get us from  New York  To LA  In 10 hours  Michael  One thing  That was  Going  AIG  I think  Raised  Really got  People angry  Like that was  A chance  It was like  Madoff  It was  You finally  Put a face  On what  People just saw  As this  Anonymous  Greed  How much 
[02:47:00]  Money was  Given to  AIG  Because somebody  Told me I was  Wrong for  Crucifying them  And what was  Supposed to be  Done with that  Money and how  Much of it was  Actually given  To their  Executives and  Not kind of  Given out the  Way they  Implied it  Would be  172 billion  Dollars was  Given to  AIG and  The New York  Times reported  Yesterday  Doesn't look  Like they're  Going to be  Able to  Pay it  Back  And they  They gave  They gave  There was  There were  I think  I'm going to  I don't have  The statistics  172 billion  Billion  And then 
[02:47:30]  They gave  Out  You're right  They gave  Out billions  Of dollars  In bonuses  After they  Took our  Money  And then  They gave  Like say  10 billion  To Goldman  Sachs  Because they  Had insurance  Policies on  The money  That Goldman  Sachs  Lost  But Goldman  Sachs  Had already  Taken 10  Billion  Of the  Bailout  Money  So they  Double  Dipped  So you've  Got this  You've got  This really  Kind of  Sick and  Twisted  Situation  Going on  Here  Where  I mean  Seriously  Guys  We all  Have some  Crazy  Brother-in-law  Or uncle  Who doesn't  Know how  To live  Within his  Means  Right  I mean  You know 
[02:48:00]  It's always  In need of  Money  Coming for  A loan  And you  Keep giving  Him money  And then  Finally  You've got  To say  Dude  You've got  To get  It together  I can't  Keep giving  You money  But that's  Not how  we treated wall street the crazy brother-in-laws down there just blew everybody's pension fund  everyone's 401ks everybody just like the money just vaporizes and then they come to us the people  who they lost the money from yeah and say hey give me some more and you know what did we do  our representatives what they do wrote them a blank check here and they didn't say here's 
[02:48:30]  there's no accountability you don't have to say what you're using it for you know pay it back  when you can there's no time limit unbelievable could you imagine go to a bank and getting a car  loan like that i mean it's just absolutely nice absolutely insane how much how much of the  problem though was at the fall and i don't know the answer to this how much of it was the fault of  the banks being forced to lend to people that they they kind of wouldn't have lended to to begin with  because they didn't feel that they were they were very high risk and how much was the government  going look we'll take care of it if these people can't pay it back like was it a lot of times the 
[02:49:00]  greed of the banks or was it the government telling the banks look we got you covered if these people  don't pay you back that is part of it in fact this is a crazy thing the government did when they  handed out the bailout money they made all the banks take it they told all the banks you got because  because they didn't want the public to know which were the banks that were really belly up i mean  completely no cash in in the till and so because the public would go oh those are the bad banks so i  don't want my money in there so all the banks and took money again to create a shell game so that we 
[02:49:30]  the people wouldn't know where the really bad banks and wouldn't you like to know i mean can  you know where's the safest bank right now to put your money yeah i think i'd like to know that but  we can't find that out because the government is protecting them because they're worried that  there'll be a run on the bad banks but if you remember the savings and loan scandal back in the  80s similar thing happened the government stepped in and took receivership of these banks they just took  them over and they said okay we're going to sort this out and these banks over here that have 
[02:50:00]  been fucking around you know you're out right you these banks okay you're solid you you stay  and then they then they turned it back over to the banks and it saved the system at that moment  that's not what they did this time they didn't say okay uh we're sending in the feds we're going to  straighten this mess out we got to protect the people's pensions that's not what they doled out  money just doled it out hope for the best hope for the best that they were going to do the right  thing but they doled it out to crazy people who who then the same chairman are still there the same  people yeah that's something i completely don't agree with no no heads rolled during this whole 
[02:50:30]  thing it was a giant uh clusterfuck uh and no heads really rolled right on it's like it's like giving  your kid something that and the kid just is reckless with it and breaks it and and and you and you you  see this happen right just totally reckless and you say to your kid oh have another one you know and  then they then they break that one oh have another one i mean that's what's going on here there's 
[02:51:00]  they know now this is the worst thing actually they know now in the future they can just fuck up and  fuck around as much as they want because big daddy government is going to be there to give them some  socialism but don't use some social welfare money don't you see though that people are starting to  catch on to this i mean i don't i don't think i've ever seen a nation more educated in uh the likes of  the economy how it's uh not working how the government is stepping in when maybe they 
[02:51:30]  shouldn't absolutely nothing like a wake-up call at 52 years old to find your pension gone when you  were going to retire in 10 years and i think there's the one thing that really stops this  innovation that we need that you were talking about we do need new things uh new technology  is just perpetuating the old technology by pumping money in it and trying to keep it  on its uh broken legs let it fold let it go under because something else will take its place  that's what they told us free enterprise was you know you rise or fall based on how well you do  and if you don't do well with you on this 
[02:52:00]  god damn it well that but that's scary because actually and and you'll and you know they've been  they've tested the studio test these movies you know before they release them and they found that  that that of all my movies more republicans are going to go to this one than any of my other films  they say you give democrats a pretty hard time in this one it's not just an attack on the public  oh yeah oh yeah no no no i there's we go right we go right after anybody who's on the take i don't  care if they're democratic republican whatever uh we've got to be the watchdog of this thing here 
[02:52:30]  and well now now talking talking about industry in this country and the fact that um you know we used  to be a powerhouse years ago and now i mean we aren't making things uh i see a lot of the problem  being the the whole world now is involved in the economy of the world it didn't you really used to be  that way you had your powerhouses uh we were one of them the the top one but now there's so many  other countries involved that are using virtual slave labor how is the united states to supposed 
[02:53:00]  to compete with a country like china uh that is pumping out products at nothing because they're  using slave labor very easy how do we do this very easy china can't survive unless we allow their  products in bottom line and so we can say to them you know what we're not going to sell anything in  the united states made by essentially slave labor but we're supposed to then suck it up and pay more  for american products which which it sounds noble it sounds noble noble but real sounds american it oh i'll 
[02:53:30]  give you that but the realism of it is isn't just ceos being greedy this is the american people feeling  entitled and greedy and and saying you know if i could get this product for two bucks why am i  going to pay six bucks for it uh and and i think that's putting us in a not every not everyone does  that you know when i need something and begley jr doesn't for the love of god thank god for him 
[02:54:00]  can i just take anthony's point because the next point with that is kind of if we do that too we stop  chinese stuff from coming in here won't it also hurt the workers here because a they don't want to spend  more money for american products because it's more money but then china and other countries will stop  our products from going there which also hurts industry here the trade rate between china and  us is ridiculous ridiculous we give them a fraction of what they're sending over here so you're right  though i mean listen i don't want hard-working people who are struggling and living from paycheck  to paycheck to have to pay an extra five dollars for a shirt if they don't have to but by doing that 
[02:54:30]  too we've also um um prevented what really needs to happen here when when you if you can't afford  that shirt if you can't afford that new car you might be encouraged to get with your other workers  and form a union and and negotiate better wages for yourself i mean that's what my dad did that's what  my grandfather did and that's how the middle class was created because a bunch of working stiffs with no  college education said damn it you're going to have to pay us a little bit more so we can buy your cars 
[02:55:00]  and henry ford to his credit realized i'm not going to sell any cars to a bunch of paupers i've got to  create help create a middle class here so i can sell those cars and when i sell those cars that means  i'm going to put more people to work because all these cars are being bought and then i hire more people  then they buy cars and kaboom and you have what we had for those you know few decades where you know 
[02:55:30]  you had a chance to live a decent my dad my mom didn't have to work we lived on one income a lot  of homes our three income homes where the teenager is having to work uh you know that's not the american  dream that's not what i grew up with that's not my dad fought for in world war ii and and and and we  should just say that's it that's enough of that and let's not get hung up with whether we're democrats  or republicans liberals or conservatives we are all in the same boat here never seen a bigger  divide though than i know it's amazing i'll be actually you saw the movie i mean it's yeah what 
[02:56:00]  do you what do you see for the the future there michael moore how does this end is it all doom and  gloom or or are we looking at rome do you see the people uh i've got that in the movie yeah i know  the opening scene uh comparing america to the romans for the fall of the roman empire and then and also  the jesus thing you know reworking jesus's lines in an old jesus movie was pretty funny about uh yeah  that was my homage to you guys to get into so i can get in trouble but will the american people 
[02:56:30]  ever get so fed up that they do something outrageous in this country or are we too busy  trying to pay our bills i mean will there be some kind of kind of revolt i think there is a revolt  right now that's simmering it's simmering we all see it but i mean will it go away or will it continue  how bad does it have to get i mean right now one out of every eight homes is in delinquency or  foreclosure that's just amazing one out of every eight i i saw the statistic the other day that  there's that uh and i i got i was able to i mean a few weeks ago i put this right the last thing i 
[02:57:00]  put in the film in the credits was there's there's one foreclosure filing in america every seven and a  half seconds wow i mean we are in deep deep shit here and the other shoes haven't dropped i mean  what about the commercial real estate crash that's about to happen what about the credit card  crash that i mean there's so much credit card yeah this is all stuff that's piled on the back of  people having been out of work and this it it does trickle down now to you go to the malls like we  were talking i said you go to the mall not that many people there used to be it's empty yeah yeah my 
[02:57:30]  shows are never empty but i mean the mall of course your shows who would want to laugh i was joking  saying there's no problem out there because i see people spending but then i went to the uh a mall about a  week ago and i literally counted 12 people i mean it wasn't prime time mall time but still  there was 12 people what do you think what do you think of these people um uh protesting uh you know  they call them the tea party that's part of the revolt and a lot of it uh i mean obviously uh fox  news covers it a lot more than cnn does uh they've complained about that and that way it's been tacked to 
[02:58:00]  this kind of right wing thing but what i what i'm seeing is it's not all right it's not all right  right exactly i'm seeing angry people that don't want to uh have their arm twisted behind their back  and another hand in their pocket what's happened to be perceived as right wing more than it's  perceived that way because of what he said fox news has tried to own it right right they've tried  to make it their own mistake they're making for the american people absolutely because we get more  people involved if they didn't do that that's right it doesn't need to be a divided thing all people  need to get involved look this is a great country we have this great open democracy where you can 
[02:58:30]  protest and speak your mind and demand that your representatives do what you want them to do  not the people who are paying them the big bucks but my liberal causes do you see liberal causes when  they protest the liberal cause be uh the the media being more tolerant to them than they are  a more conservative uh cause or protest i i really don't see the media being as tolerant and and the  name calling i think the mainstream media generally doesn't like any protest and they try to berate it 
[02:59:00]  and make it look strange or weird or funny or whatever because remember the mainstream media i mean this  is owned by large corporations too they have a vested interest in the status quo they don't want  people out there rocking the boat because god knows what could happen if the boat rocked a little bit  too much so um so generally i don't i don't i think both sides get it but but i think what the liberals  and the left should stop doing is criticizing those republicans and conservatives who are exercising  uh their freedom of speech and they're making it racial and anti-obama it's like i think the media i think 
[02:59:30]  you don't think you should let them off the hook i really think that they are attacking these guys  calling them rednecks and they're a bunch of racists who don't like their the president when  they're really just protesting taxes yeah some of them are i mean that's you can't get around that  i agree with that i mean because here's where here's it wasn't so much the teabaggers that got me but  that day that uh president obama was going to speak to all the school children uh via satellite  and he and he wasn't doing this as a political speech he was doing this as a president united states and  people kept their kids home from school you know this is the wrong thing to teach kids you you you 
[03:00:00]  have to respect the the office of the presidency even if you disagree with the president and you  know as much as i disagree with george w bush as much as i fought him on his policies i never uttered  the words i hate george w bush because i don't hate george w bush he's a human being he's a dad you know  he's a husband he should not be demonized and this is why we our discourse is so fucked up now 
[03:00:30]  because we're we feel like we have to turn the other person into the devil simply because we  don't agree with him on gun control i mean for crying out loud can't we just have the disagreement  and let's have the great debate congress will vote based on what we tell them to do and that'll be  there boy that would be nice wouldn't that be nice it'd be amazing wow obama had a nice way of  putting don't turn the other side into a caricature right of what you want of the arguments but that's  been going on for so many years now we got to wrap up unless uh oh damn we could do easily another 
[03:01:00]  half hour i know believe me i'd love to have michael moore here for michael well you got to stop by  where we could spend some real time with no i i will come back i will i you know i'm i do want to  i'm in michigan now most of the time but uh but i'm here a lot in new york i'd love to come back and  talk to you guys well you love that michigan have you ever been there hell no we're not crazy  we're not crazy i know we went to detroit once for one of our comedy shows we were right near the uh  the stadium there right in the middle of nowhere we didn't really see detroit we parachuted in we're  taken out at humvees it was amazing it was it was pretty impressive they brought you in from canada 
[03:01:30]  yeah the back door i know you got to go but i do want to say one thing i'm glad you took on that  whole student loan thing something we talk about on the show where these kids are going to school  and they're in debt it's like welcome to debt here's your life they start to do they start their  working lives in debt uh 80 to 100 000 we've been making this point lately on our show it's just  ridiculous how about now that these those first few weeks of college right now ask any college  student the first day they got all these tables lined up from the credit card companies trying 
[03:02:00]  to sign 18 year olds up for credit cards they don't have a job right but they don't care they  give them they give them a thousand dollar five thousand ten thousand dollar credit limit  and and all of a sudden they're in debt before they even have a job i know i was very responsible  with my credit card my first one i bought a jet ski  but now but 22 years old they leave college with about six thousand dollars of credit card debt and  like you said maybe upward to eight to a hundred thousand dollars of student loan debt so they got  a fucking noose around their neck right from the get-go instead of being able to go get the job they 
[03:02:30]  want to get or maybe you know backpack around europe for a year or you know just fuck off and do  whatever they've got to go work some shit job that they don't like and they can start hating  themselves at age 22 and start the miserable work-a-day life that they listen we all have  to work but what happens to our dreams or the things we want to do or try to do you can't do  that anymore have worked that hard through school and and gone to college you you do assume you can  come out and and do more than start the guy that kind of dropped out of high school right just comes 
[03:03:00]  into it no actually the same job the guy who who graduates from high school it doesn't go to college  he's got a four-year head start on you now got a four-year head start and that 80 to 100 turns out  to be a half million in the end that's right you pay a half million dollars in the end for what  should be free so where would you go to college state of new york the state of california when i  went to college state of california state new york all college was free yeah college was free  and in a place like michigan there was a financial aid office and and you got to go essentially for free 
[03:03:30]  you had to work in the cafeteria or the library 10 hours a week whatever but that was it you then  you sit out into the world with no debt right uh you graduate from high school now you work for four  years when you're 22 at that point and first of all they haven't given you they won't give you a  credit card because because you are a high school student or a high school graduate so you don't have  the credit card debt you don't have the student loan debt you're already had what's the message there  we're encouraging the idiocracy we're encouraging people to actually don't go to school don't learn 
[03:04:00]  don't better yourself let's just be stupid it's what i do every day here and look how it's benefited  you too see god bless america michael moore the movie you don't need our help but we're just glad  you stopped by and said hi capitalism a love story in new york city and la and then uh nationwide uh  october 2nd october 2nd everywhere it's it's cool it's my uh my largest opening of any film i've ever  had that's this friday uh it's everywhere in the country no no no a week from friday today today 
[03:04:30]  new york and la okay a week from friday everywhere all right that's great right on all right michael  thank you so much thank you very much michael moore everyone we'll take a break uh-oh i got proof  that anthony actually agrees with everything michael moore says because after the interview he ran over  to michael moore and shook his hand and also took a picture with michael moore you got some explaining  to do my friend why wouldn't i my proof will be up on my uh youtube channel op radio you know i would  think that you two would disagree and that you wouldn't want to shake the man's hand or take a 
[03:05:00]  picture with the man we agree to disagree on many things i will be honest with you though this subject  matter uh even though we weren't able to delve into it as deeply as i would have liked to it was just  starting to get good a lot of this stuff um i don't have that big a disagreement with him on  you know as far as the country being fucked uh it's hard to say hey you're wrong uh you know 
[03:05:30]  uh the thing i don't agree with is you know the the american dream thing and well i was going off on  that i i need more knowledge and trying to get a little more knowledge these tea parties right  i completely look at it as a republican thing he's trying to say it's not but because fox is taking uh  ownership of this yeah it is perceived that it's more republican well because do you know anything  more about this is there a a nice percentage of uh democrats undecideds i would middle of the 
[03:06:00]  rotors that are doing going to these things too or is it really a lot of republicans i would say a lot  of republicans libertarians things like that because he's saying the opposite it's perceived as being  anti-obama and anti-democrat tax and spend so why are democrats going to be marching around really  and that's why it gets such a bad rap because when you get a lot of republicans in one spot  that all of a sudden in the media is portrayed as some kind of clan rally 
[03:06:30]  meanwhile you could have a million man march that is put on by uh a fanatic who was his speeches were  uh farrakhan's speeches were beyond bizarre and racist and uh that whole thing was treated as a  wonderful moment for um african americans to come together uh in washington right and then when you  get uh these people protesting taxes they're uh freaks extremists racists militiamen it's a double 
[03:07:00]  standard that the mainstream media puts on it fox um looks at it differently because it's  most of their viewers uh are are out there you know right okay uh okay he i thought he hung up  thank god big john in iowa what's up big john yeah what was what was hyped is uh going to be a  smackdown was more like a tender stroking with ample attention to the balls there anthony oh shit um 
[03:07:30]  oh excuse me sir i heard i heard a lot of tough talk before he got in studio and then i heard i heard  a lot of uh smacking sounds all right i'll address that sir um first of all uh we only had 15 minutes  with the gentleman why did we only have 15 because he had an hour with somebody else talking about i  guess uh how he lost his virginity and uh how many chicks he's banged over the years and uh are there  any hot chicks in your film and i don't know what the interview was like but uh that left us with 15 
[03:08:00]  mere minutes to cover an entire career uh of this gentleman and we didn't get into stuff where it  would have been heated like gun control control bowling for columbine all that stuff i would have  loved to have gotten into you let them walk on unions you let them walk on unions that they're  the save all and not a part of this problem no no no i i by that point we were getting the one minute  to hard out message that i was reading and the publicists looking through the windows uh i i did want 
[03:08:30]  to address the unions i i i have done that on the show but one thing that he actually made sense with  that i started going like wow you know that that does make sense is this kind of cyclical um economy  where he brought up henry ford and uh how he paid his employees so they could buy the cars and then  it's gonna cut into your profits as a company but more people will be able to buy your cars  so you make more money to sell them to the people that are making more money so we kind of got out of 
[03:09:00]  that cyclical economy and got to the point where the company is now saying we want to make a lot of  money not pay the employees and now we've run out of people to sell our shit to so he actually made  that's why i turned around and said i hate agreeing with you i hate that i'm agreeing with you on on this  and so i just heard you say unions i just came back the i thought of the unions too and they're not 
[03:09:30]  perfect and they've maybe contributed but they have not to me displayed the absolutely despicable  behavior that a lot of the higher ups have oh you know jimmy jimmy all due respect you're looking at  think about this in terms of baseball okay uh you got you got your cal ripkin versus your sammy sosa  okay the the executives are your sammy sosa they have they have record years at a lot of great big  home runs okay your cal ripkins are there every freaking game batting it out what are the unions 
[03:10:00]  doing every freaking day every freaking day they take take take well they also do they also  the mvp of corruption let me tell you something that's there every day taken no no i'm gonna get  the dinger i'm telling you i i can only go by like a situation i'm not going to go into it but i'm in  right now and i'm going to tell you the despicable behavior of certain people in certain positions  i will never believe that regular workers aren't going to get fucked by people who can fuck them 
[03:10:30]  fuck i'm pissed you understand what i'm saying no one when it comes to money is honest shit so i i  don't i'm not saying you dude unions became uh there out of necessity unions formed out of necessity  because the workers would be treated like garbage that's why unions formed and do they get corrupt  sure do they overextend their purpose in a lot of cases absolutely do they protect laziness and  insubordination yes yes i'm not saying you're wrong but they are not the the cause of the downfall 
[03:11:00]  these companies and i don't i don't think that uh upton sinclair had uh building the mirage uh  or the sands in his vision of what a labor union should be doing let alone uh you know being the  first third of the cost of an automobile uh based upon the completely bloated and artificial benefits  that they've been able to derive that you and i pay for yes maybe we do but you know what it's always  going to try to get up over you financially it's always going to be the athlete what benefits are 
[03:11:30]  what benefits do you mean that the unions are getting that's so so different than what the  executives are getting what benefits are the union getting they're so amazing no the question  is what they're getting versus the executives then you look you're looking at the wrong picture  you have a the vast majority of uh workers out there are not under a labor union and they have  decent benefits and it's what's competitive you go up to any small town like i'm out here in the  midwest and you get a nice benefit package that's comparable to what you could get with any other  small employer uh but if you were to if you were to go to work and just happen to have that uaw on 
[03:12:00]  your back uh then your benefit package would be probably worth about three times more uh for for  a lesser job not to mention the fact that you basically can't get fired from it that's what i'm  saying protects lazy hold on i think that's where they protect laziness that's where they overextend  they protect insubordination they do overextend what they were intended to do i don't disagree with  that and i don't disagree with the fact that they've contributed to a major problem but i will 
[03:12:30]  never fault them as much as the greed and the bad decision making and the lack of accountability of  upper management because they don't fire themselves i'm telling you like we just talked about we saw  it in this country the upper management of these places by and large was not being fucking fired  no that's the job of the shareholders but i think you got to be an equal opportunity cynic here  yeah you can't just look up and say it's bad i mean that's just feeding right into  so what more is saying yes i agree with a lot of what you're saying it's everywhere and you got  on yourself you got to you got to be in charge of your own decisions and and to say that oh well 
[03:13:00]  yeah they're despicable because they they make more they're able to make those decisions the same  shit happens all the way down all the way down to the freaking line supervisor it doesn't matter  it does matter yes it does are you in management or union are you a union or scale so are you a  union or a management guy i'm self-employed okay so you're you have neither all right all right big  john good phone call thank you we want to give uh other people a chance here big john from iowa  all right man let's say hi to matt in queensbury matt hey guys hey jimmy get back up here to queensbury 
[03:13:30]  hey buddy um i just want to say that and you really you really showed him uh a major call to man  look like a savage beating look i gotta defend him we only had 15 minutes because the king had  him for over an hour you know it wasn't really much to to nail him on yeah and the king had him  for an hour and you know that that ate into our time yeah they made michael moore ride the sabian  machine or whatever it's called they we just didn't have enough time to get into everything it was about 
[03:14:00]  to get heated and they were pulling him out of here yeah well you made some good points man there was  he's arguing just to argue like michael moore won me over after a second like i said i didn't i don't  agree with everything he says but the theme of what he was saying i do agree with because it's kind  of how i felt i just like he was supposed to be over here earlier and then they had a clean um  arty lang's vomit off of his pants uh which took a long time also yeah you know so you know a lot 
[03:14:30]  of things we did the best with what they gave us yes what can i tell you i just like when michael moore  yells at buildings he he really shows buildings that he means business certainly does let's go to  cam in south carolina cam good morning boys motherfucking cam what up now mike that's what  is uh yeah i know it was a short interview and i used to be despised michael moore just hate him  watching through the movies and honestly you guys i saw myself doing the same thing i was doing i said 
[03:15:00]  damn it i couldn't agree with this guy yeah i was i actually had to tell him i was angry that i was  agreeing with him on things and and believe me if we were sitting here talking about a lot of the  subjects especially bowling for columbine and stuff like that we would have uh a little more of a heated  discussion um but a lot of the stuff he was saying what are you going to do argue with somebody for  the sake of arguing uh with him i think a lot of ceos of the companies are bastards i think um  you know the the the banks uh like you said double dipping like that while the insurance company of 
[03:15:30]  the banks getting a bailout and paying insurance uh payments to the banks that were bailed out i'm  supposed to go yeah yeah they should get that money like what was i supposed to do in that situation  the guy was making valid fucking points very good i gotta i gotta break in because you uh mispronounced  uh sabian or whatever and said sabian and people are appreciating that because they know who tim sabian  is and and the visual in the machine and the visual of michael moore having to ride yes tim sabian 
[03:16:00]  is pretty fucking funny i didn't mean the machine i meant tim sabian he actually was riding tim yeah  they were doing bull riding on the howard show today those are the people slacks he pulled that  that fat hog out of his slacks and michael jumped aboard those are the people that really know this  radio show they appreciated the mispronunciation because it made it pretty funny ah right uh lee from  tennessee how are you lee i'm great man how you guys doing today we're doing all right yeah yeah  uh i just want to point out something that uh you have to respect the intelligence of michael moore 
[03:16:30]  knowing that he knows you guys and he took the conversation in a safe direction for for himself  and uh the other thing i wanted to point out was uh anthony and uh michael moore sitting in a tree  k-i-s-s-i-s-i-s-s-i-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s 
[03:17:00]  You can call him Ray.  Sorry.  I didn't know that was coming, Jimmy.  I'm glad you didn't.  That's why I surprised you with it.  Good.  I like surprising people.  Hey, I just want to let you know, man, you guys are drinking the Kool-Aid.  It's not.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  His description is a problem.  It's correct, and I agree with him.  It's the solutions that are all fucked up.  What was the solution that he said that was wrong?  Well, just everything he said in all his last movies and shit.  I mean, I've looked at him, and it's just, you know, I agree with you, man.  I'm sitting here listening to him, and I'm thinking, yeah, okay, I've got to go with that.  But then he starts talking about bringing up the unions, bringing up all this socialist crap.  Yeah, the union thing, everyone pretty much knows my union stance.  I think the unions were very useful years ago in keeping pretty much slave labor from happening, sweatshops, things like that. 
[03:18:00]  But they've turned into something that has broken the backs of companies where now the companies, the pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Where the companies have said, you know something?  Fuck you.  We've got to turn a profit here.  I'm not going to sit here with a union delegate telling me I've got to pay these motherfuckers $40 an hour when they're not worth fucking $20 an hour.  And it breaks the back of some of these smaller and mid-range companies, not the big, giant fucking companies that you read about every day and it's the scumbag CEOs. 
[03:18:30]  But the people that are represented by these unions, it broke the back of the country.  But haven't the unions given back a lot of money, too?  Like, they've given back money and given back wages and stuff like that?  Like?  Oh, making concessions?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, only when put in a corner where it's like you make a concession or we have to let you go.  Or you're not on strike. 
[03:19:00]  You're fired.  We can't afford it.  We're going to close up shop.  So then they go, all right, we'll make concessions.  Oh, gee, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  After breaking our fucking backs for a few decades here, now you're going to start making some fucking concessions?  Does upper management make concessions?  Maybe they do.  I mean, maybe in some cases they do.  You know, in many cases I think union delegates and management can come to some kind of amicable agreement with each other.  But in other cases, the unions are blatantly taking advantage of management and then vice versa, too. 
[03:19:30]  If you don't have a strong union, the workers are getting fucked.  What I was mentioning about China, though, producing a lot of goods and services that are a lot cheaper than the United States is,  I didn't agree with his answer that the unions are the answer to that.  I mean, you know, I don't know what the answer is to that.  And I don't know if America, you know, he likes taking the everyman's view and looking at big corporations and CEOs like they're the scumbags. 
[03:20:00]  But I think I brought up a good point, and you didn't really address that, with the fact that Americans themselves are too selfish to pay $5 for something they can get for $3.  So if you could buy a shirt made in China for, you know, $5 or one made here in the States for $8, you're going to buy the $5 shirt?  You're never going to turn that around.  People are always going to look for, you know, cheaper goods.  If you tell the person you're being more patriotic and helping the country by buying the more expensive shirt, they're going to go, you know something? 
[03:20:30]  Fuck you.  I paid my taxes.  A small percentage will buy into it, but the majority will never buy into that mentality.  You're absolutely right.  There's no fucking way.  We've got to look at another solution.  Because there's a general greed in this country, and I don't know if it's worldwide.  I haven't been to enough of the world to see that.  I have!  But I know, Jamie.  They say there's less greed elsewhere.  But in this country, we are a greedy nation.  We're usually out for ourselves, and we like a good deal. 
[03:21:00]  We like telling people when we got a good deal on something.  So in order to be more patriotic, you're going to pay more?  In order to help the economy in the long run, you think your three bucks is going to—  People don't think their $3 more is going to make a difference.  One of the best points of the movie, the reason why we, the people, like, put up with—  The United States of America, in order to form more perfect—  Put up with the rich getting richer, and what not?  Yeah.  He simplified it simply.  He said that the average American really believes they could be the next— 
[03:21:30]  The next guy to be in that—  Position.  Position.  And that's why, as a whole, we accept it.  No matter—right.  We accept it because we really believe that we could be the next CEO getting the $200 million bonus or whatever.  And if you're getting that, you are going to turn around and think differently about financial situations and the country and the way it's run and tax structure and everything else.  You're going to think differently about it.  But that point in the movie was like, wow. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  He just brought it all together.  Why don't we end with a funny?  We've got a line of the day, but we also have this quick little funny clip.  Oh, what is it?  What is it?  You know, we've been talking about the town hall meetings and the teabaggers and stuff.  Yeah, teabaggers.  We've got a nice—  I like the Roman war helmeters.  That's what I want to do.  I want to have a town hall meeting where we just Roman war helmet each other.  I want the Cleveland steamers.  I kind of like the concept, though.  Come on, Jimmy.  Jimmy's teeth hurt a little bit.  I kind of like it. 
[03:22:30]  I do, too, and I wanted to enjoy it.  No.  But I couldn't—unless I took my fingers and pushed my lips up into a smile, I couldn't enjoy that.  Because then we could go with the Cleveland steamers.  We could have a whole—  Yes.  We could have a whole bit here.  People couldn't see it, but Ant just turned and looked at me after he did the joke and then just held his nose like pew.  I went pew.  I think it had potential.  I like when Jimmy doesn't like my jokes.  Our problem is we don't.  It's very rare.  It's funny.  Our problem is we don't rewrite ever.  We just go with it.  Go with it. 
[03:23:00]  Instead of thinking it over for a minute.  And these kids are not ready to be parents, nor are they ready to have AIDS, nor are they—and they have to have this straightforward education in these grades.  I don't think any of these people know that you can have sexual satisfaction without taking your clothes off.  I—okay, embarrassment.  I'm 56 years old, and I'm a virgin.  I'm sorry.  Technically.  But has the bell gone off?  Well, the bell has not gone off, but testimony should be relevant to the item before. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, I didn't help.  And I believe the item you're discussing is what we did yesterday.  Holy fuckaroni.  What was that from?  It was one of these fucking town hall meetings.  They were discussing, like, curriculum for the Board of Education.  What the fuck is she coming up with that crap about a dried-out twat?  She must be a fun person to hang with.  I'm a 56-year-old virgin, technically.  Sexy, too. 
[03:24:00]  So you could have sex with your clothes on.  So she's dry-humped at some juncture.  I like her Sam hair.  She's fucking awful.  Oh, my God.  She looks like me from Rotgut.  But not quite as hot.  You're sexier than Rotgut with your white suit.  Yes.  Jimmy, you want one that doesn't agree with you, or you want to move on?  Take a wish.  I'd be happy to.  I'm not right about everything.  All right.  Line of the day, but first, Nick in Ohio.  Last phone call of the day.  Nick, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  I just want to say the one thing that bothers me. 
[03:24:30]  I'm going to say what I said.  Do you realize how much of a jackass you sound like, Jimmy, that every time someone brings  up the unions and how bad they are for the country now at this point and how much they  are destroying the middle range corporations that you go, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, but the  CEOs are bad, too.  That's not what I said.  Hold on.  No, hold on.  That's not what I said.  I said.  No, it's not.  I said that the unions did contribute. 
[03:25:00]  I said the unions do contribute.  Stop.  Stop trying to get me to yell at you.  Stop.  Shh.  Shh.  I said that the unions did contribute to the problem.  This is the guy who wants me to yell at him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wants Jimmy to yell at him.  Stop trying to be a character.  No, I don't want you to yell at him.  Then stop.  I'm listening to you.  He was voted most wants Jimmy to yell at him.  You're misquoting me.  You're just misquoting me.  I'm not misquoting you.  You just said it five minutes ago to Anthony.  I just said, did I not say that the unions definitely contributed to the problems? 
[03:25:30]  No, I'm not.  You're just trying to get me to yell at you.  You're a shitty caller and you're a knee-jerk reactionary.  You sound like a fat man.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Stop being so exasperated.  You sound stupid.  You're misquoting me.  Well, then keep sitting there and listening, little boy.  Be a good girl and keep listening. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, just keep listening.  But then don't listen.  I don't care if you agree or not.  I don't know who you are.  Good.  Because you don't agree with me.  You don't agree with me.  That's why you're a little bitch because you don't agree with me and you don't like the  fact that I have a radio show I can speak on.  That's why you yell when you call because you want to be heard. 
[03:26:30]  You want me to yell at you.  No, I want you to do what you usually do.  Good boy.  Oh, big boy.  Oh, and you start telling jokes.  But at least, at least.  But you're not, you're not, you're not arguing, though.  You're not arguing.  You're a hypocrite.  You're not arguing.  You want me to scream at you.  I made my point.  The unions do contribute to part of the problem.  They are not the entire problem, but they absolutely contribute to the problem. 
[03:27:00]  That you are a hypocrite?  Dude, you can say it all you want.  Do you know how many people know that you're a hypocrite?  I know who, as many millions as listen to this show.  Yes, I know it, Jim.  As long as you keep listening, that's all that matters.  But I made my point about unions, and you're a dumb motherfucker if you actually just blame  the unions.  You just blame the unions, you dummy.  I don't just blame the unions.  Yes, you do.  They knocked out every corporation. 
[03:27:30]  Shut your fucking Jim Cramer voice mouth.  You're just trying to start an argument.  You just want to yell.  Be funny.  Don't be political.  Be funny.  I express my political views, and I guarantee you, if you shut your fucking, just to be  very, turn down, all the way, all the way down.  There you go.  Now, let me say, now that fucking little bitch can't be heard on the radio, this is how  it works.  If you want to yell over people and be rude, this is what happens. 
[03:28:00]  Now we turn you down, and I say what I was going to say.  The unions have absolutely contributed, but to blame them solely and not upper management  is naive and stupid.  Did you hear what I just said?  You're naive and stupid.  You're naive and stupid because you're a liar.  Turn that down.  I'm not even stupid.  You're absolutely right.  I'm not stupid.  No, he said you're naive and stupid.  Oh, did he say naive?  Yes.  Maybe if he didn't yell, I would have heard him.  I know, but he's yelling. 
[03:28:30]  Go ahead, fat man voice.  Listen, I've explained to you.  All I care about is your hypocrisy, your fencing.  And I'm funny.  And I'm funny.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  And I'm funny.  And I'm funny.  Which of my jokes do you like?  You're a comedic genius.  Which of my jokes do you like?  Do you understand?  I'm not lying.  Which of my jokes do you like?  I'm not lying.  You are lying.  Which of my jokes do you like?  Which one? 
[03:29:00]  I love a lot of the things you do.  I love the Ted.  I love the Steve from Yellowstone.  Right.  I haven't done Steve from Yellowstone in a year.  In a long time.  In a long time, I know.  I listen to replays, too.  Okay.  Don't try to catch me like I don't listen to the show.  I'm only trying to catch you because you're calling up and you're being a liar by saying,  yes, you are.  You just misquoted me.  I didn't misquote you.  Yes, you did.  Okay.  Now you listen to me for a second. 
[03:29:30]  Fuck you.  You've been yelling.  I'm not going to listen to you.  I'm not going to listen to you because you're misquoting me.  You said that I did not fucking put any of the onus on the unions.  And I did.  Hold on.  Oh.  Oh.  Again.  Again.  I'm not going to compete with you on a radio show that I'm paying.  I'm willing to listen to a caller, but I'm not going to compete with you.  So what again?  Like what I would do with a woman is I would just fucking shut her up.  Now I'll shut you up.  Turn you down.  I fucking never said that the unions were blameless.  So anyone who can call up and said that I've said the unions are blameless. 
[03:30:00]  You're lying.  The unions, I said, have protected.  Turn down.  Have rewarded laziness.  The unions have rewarded fucking insubordination.  They have overextended their purpose.  I've said that many fucking times.  So for you to sit there and say that I haven't is a lie.  And you're just calling up because you want to be on the air and you're lying.  So what did I say?  What did I say?  Turn down.  Turn down. 
[03:30:30]  Turn down.  Here's how it works.  Man, talking politics gets everyone heated.  I'm not even heated.  When I ask a question or you ask me a question, but if you interrupt me, we're just going to keep turning you down.  And you could do what you normally do on a daily basis, sit there alone in your apartment or your car and yell and try to be heard.  Now, ask me something and I'll answer you.  You'll be courteous.  Now, what are you saying?  I'm telling you what you said.  What did I say?  The first of all, the caller, right before Anthony said what he had to say, his little speech on unions, the caller right before then, he was bringing up unions. 
[03:31:00]  And the first thing he did was, hey, no, but don't the CEOs, don't they not do this?  And then when Anthony brought up the unions and how bad they are, in a normal argument, you were immediately ran to, but don't the unions give concessions?  But yes, don't they?  And do the CEOs give concessions?  No.  They're both equally scum, Jim. 
[03:31:30]  So, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I hear your point.  Why is it wrong for me?  I hear your point where I have already said, look.  Am I supposed to turn him down?  No, no, no.  As long as he listens to me, I'll listen to him.  That's fine.  Okay.  I hear your point, but I have said many times, and I said it again today, that the unions absolutely have been a contributing factor by being greedy, by doing what they've done, by overextending.  I've said all that.  I agree with that.  My father was in a union, and he couldn't get back to work because the guy ahead of him was a piece of shit, and the union couldn't bypass the guy ahead of my father to get to my father to get him back to work. 
[03:32:00]  So, I have my problems with the unions too, but what we've seen recently, the problems in this country are not just because of the unions, and to say that, the top management never fucking changes, man.  They do the same thing in entertainment.  They fucking destroy a network, or they destroy, like CBS radio.  CBS radio fucked up.  They made bad decision after bad decision, and who do they blame?  The on-air talent.  They blame the fucking, the guys, the program directors. 
[03:32:30]  Nobody in upper management takes the fucking hit.  It's an uneven balance.  You're so funny.  It's perfectly balanced.  The union, the amount of money that the unions pilfer off of the American people probably well exceeds the top echelon of the money that the CEOs are raping the people for.  Now, where did you get that?  Hold on.  Where did you get that fact from?  I've never heard that.  I don't believe it.  Do I turn them down now?  No, no, no. 
[03:33:00]  As long as you talk to me, that's fine.  No, it's, I'm explaining.  I'm not saying, I didn't give a number, and I'm not giving an exact fact.  I'm giving, I read in a report, God, in a Wall Street Journal, it was about three or four years ago,  where the, if you take the amount of money the unions get as a whole for doing nothing, and then you take the CEOs, how much money they get in bonuses and how much money they get paid, it's about balance. 
[03:33:30]  I don't, I don't, I never, hold on, I, because they want to fuck us in the middle.  I never read that.  I don't necessarily believe it.  I don't let the union, I don't, hold on, I don't, but how does that make me a hypocrite when I'm being pretty balanced in the argument?  I say I fault both.  I fault upper management more, because I've dealt with them more.  I've dealt with them.  I've dealt with them.  They never blame themselves.  They're the ones who make the decisions, dude, and they never blame themselves.  What made you a hypocrite in my eyes is when I called up and I said, do you realize how much of a jackass you sound like? 
[03:34:00]  Every time somebody brings up how bad the unions are, you specifically go, you didn't, not verbatim, na-na-na-na-na, but how about the CEOs?  Just listen to what the other people say about the other evil monster in this picture without bringing up the other evil monster.  It's like, oh, this guy can murder.  Oh, but what about this guy?  He's murdering too.  But to me, when you're...  I don't want to talk about the unions and how bad they are without going, hey, how about the CEOs? 
[03:34:30]  Oh, so you don't like that I give, even though I will agree with certain points of the union being bad.  And I say I agree with that.  So you don't like me just mentioning the CEOs.  You would prefer that I just, A, just listen and don't give an opinion, or B...  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Or B, only offer an opinion on the, where I agree with the unions not being good.  Yeah, but what I would have liked is it just, it just, it hit me as not being balanced, and I'm not expecting everybody to be balanced. 
[03:35:00]  It hit me as you're just constantly going, CEO, CEO, CEO.  And, you know, I don't want to hear it because the CEOs, everybody in every newspaper and everywhere are talking about, oh, my God, they're getting such big bonuses.  They're back, nobody's bringing up the other evil.  So when the other evil gets brought up, I think it needs to get a spotlight because, you know, there's guys walking around.  And every time I go pick up a load at a union shop, it takes them up to eight to ten hours to put all the product in my truck that sometimes in non-union shops take two hours. 
[03:35:30]  And that's where I said, I don't disagree with you at all.  But you're allowing this personal dislike you have of the unions to get annoyed at me because I mentioned the counterbalance of the CEOs because probably you're not dealing with the CEOs on a daily basis.  Oh, yeah, I do too.  I'm saying – but more than likely, the guys that make your life inconvenient are some shitty union guys who are probably overpaid and probably fucking lazy so you have a particular hard-on for them, which, hey, look, I probably would too in your position. 
[03:36:00]  But don't call up and fucking pick it out on me like I'm wrong to mention the CEOs when I've dealt with them and dealt with unions.  And my experience with the CEOs has been far more dishonest, and I have found far less accountability in upper management situations because they're the guys who are making the decisions and making the firings.  So, like, I think someone said, Michael, there's a good point, but the shell game, they just kind of pass each other around. 
[03:36:30]  They don't fucking fire each other.  They fire – regular workers get fired.  They don't.  Listen, I agree with you on that point.  I was just specifically – I generally don't agree with your politics because you do – as far as I'm concerned, you do jump around too much.  I'm a more solid – I'm a more solid – I have a certain belief system, and that's the kind of one I stick to.  But to me, that's –  I understand what you're saying, and I can respect the fact all I did was call about today because it was really irking me that that one caller had such good points about the union, and then Anthony had such good points about unions. 
[03:37:00]  And believe me, I love the show, Jimmy, and I do love you.  I'm not saying you don't love me, but I don't agree.  I didn't agree with that call all of his appoint on unions.  I didn't agree with all of them.  I certainly agree with some, and I've smashed the unions, dude.  I've smashed –  I hate you.  That's where I'm coming from.  All right.  Anthony's packing his bag.  That doesn't mean –  Nick, Anthony has packed his bag. 
[03:37:30]  That doesn't mean –  Kenny is holding the elevator.  But I do jump around with politics because, you know what, as the world –  I don't have a belief system that I nail myself to the floor to, and to me, that's the problem with the country is that everybody tries to prove everything in accordance with their belief system instead of reevaluating the way they see things from time to time and going, yeah, you know what?  This makes more sense to me now than, say, it did five years ago.  Nick, that's a good point right there.  I love the show, and I respect you as much as I hate it.  All right, Nick.  I hate your politics.  Thank you, Nick.  My politics are very – it's kind of all over the place, though. 
[03:38:00]  It's like, how could you hate my politics when I don't really go to any party line?  You're a political slut.  I am.  You're all over.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  You took a picture with Michael Moore.  That's true.  I know.  That is true.  Sean Hannity is not going to be happy when I tell him about that one.  You know what?  I'm going to tell Sean Hannity.  I'm sure Hannity has a picture with Michael Moore also.  You think?  I'm sure he does.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I'm sure he does.  Did he shake his hand like you did?  I'm sure he would.  I'm sure he did.  Suck his cock?  Sean Hannity, you suck his cock? 
[03:38:30]  Suck his cock?  Let's do line of the day.  Let's see how you diffuse an angry situation.  And that has nothing to do with the fact that fucking pre-sale tickets for my Boston show  go on sale in an hour and 24 minutes.  Who cares?  You know what's great?  You know what's great?  All politics, too, for this show.  Yep.  No jokes.  All politics with Jim Norton.  That'll get the tickets.  All right.  Trust me on that one, Jimmy.  Wilbertheater.com.  Today at noon for 24 hours, my pre-sale for my November 28th Boston Wilbertheater shows  go on sale.  Well, again, last time I sold out all three shows, I'm not being arrogant, but just get 
[03:39:00]  tickets.  Be arrogant.  And this Saturday, Jersey, Montclair.  I notice you're on the road a lot.  Everything all right with you?  Just trying to get bills paid.  Believe me.  Just regular bills?  My fucking, my defense slightly more of unions.  Yeah.  Unions have never done to me what I've had done to me in certain management situations.  Ever.  You're all right with what they did to you?  No.  Disgusted.  Fuck, so am I.  We're trying to work it out.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Just stop already with the fucking Tyra Banks was experiencing racism. 
[03:39:30]  If they needed a black woman with hair like Jason Alexander, you were the one they called.  I'm a fucking bald idiot.  Say Jimmy being funny.  Jimmy can be very funny.  And there was a little political thing in there, too.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little twinge.  Black shouldn't be able to vote.  I heard it, Jimmy.  I didn't say that.  It was in there.  No, no.  I've Twittered that.  You've Twittered that.  All right.  Goodness gracious.  You didn't hear that?  Not at all.  Another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:40:00]  I thought you were Michael Moore for a second.  Oh, Jesus.  I was going to say you're Michael a lot more.  You've got to appreciate the bounce pass, though.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Set up right there.  Because I'm never going to get any of these.  I might as well get a few assists.  Motherfuckers.  What do we got?  Another one?  Another runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, he's got a shirt with a big S on it.  He's missing the two bits.  I have another shirt.  It says, Hit Dick. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  Let's listen to some Larry King and Tyra Banks.  Hold on.  I have to find my other shirt with Ucker of Cock on it.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Ucker of Cock.  Nice.  And is that it, Danny?  Should we go home now?  No, no.  We got Here Comes Line of the Day.  Oh, that?  Okay, do that.  Here comes Line of the Day. 
[03:41:00]  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Jimmy, you're covering up.  Into crushed glass.  It wasn't a cone and it wasn't ice cream dribbling up.  It wasn't.  It was the ice cream man who made you stick your hand through the dragon-faced garbage thing.  Are you ready?  They were great, though.  Come on, you motherfuckers.  You're sitting in a Barry Manilow concert. 
[03:41:30]  Are you ready?  It isn't.  Look how bad Jimmy is.  Let me hear you make some noise.  I want to see.  I want to see.  Jimmy's even red now listening to the recording of the first time we played that.  He throws his headphones off and puts his face in his hands and turns very, very red.  It's just adorable.  It sure is, Ant.  It sure is.  I guess we're done for today, huh? 
[03:42:00]  Yes!  Let's go for the love of God.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  Thank you. </pre>
