<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a chaotic introduction, immediately launching into a discussion about the Van Halen reunion tour.  The hosts played audio clips from a Van Halen press conference, mocking David Lee Roth's pronouncements and speculating about the tour's imminent failure, fueled by humorous observations about Roth's age, health, and the band's perceived decline in quality since their 80s heyday.  They also joked about Wolfgang Van Halen's weight and placed a bet on when the tour would end.  The conversation then shifted to Whoopi Goldberg's new morning radio show, "Waking Up with Whoopi," playing audio clips from the show to highlight its perceived awkwardness and lack of chemistry between Goldberg and her co-host, Paul Cubby Bryant.  The hosts mocked Goldberg's attempts at creating a positive show, contrasting it with their own raunchy style, and predicted its imminent failure.  Listener calls further contributed to this segment, with many agreeing with the hosts' assessment.  Technical difficulties with audio playback punctuated this section of the show.  One host even mentioned knocking over a speaker.

The show then segued into a discussion of their perceived rivalry with Whoopi Goldberg's show, with the hosts engaging in offensively comedic banter, including antisemitic remarks from one host while intoxicated and insensitive jokes about multiple sclerosis and emergency medical services.  This was followed by the arrival of Nicole Starr, a self-described "tall midget," who promoted her pornographic website.  In-studio guests Jack Black and Colin Hanks joined the hosts in increasingly explicit and sexually charged conversation with Nicole, culminating in her partially disrobing on-air.  The interaction became notably uncomfortable due to Nicole's apparent sadness and Colin Hanks's visible discomfort, further amplified by his repeated mentions of his father, Tom Hanks.  The segment continued with listener calls, some praising Colin Hanks, while others criticizing the show's content, including a comedian who claimed to know one of the hosts.

The final segment centered on a call from a listener named Nicole whose boyfriend, Jason, was reluctant to have sex with her after two years of dating.  Opie and Anthony, along with Jack Black and Colin Hanks, pressured Jason to have sex with Nicole, even offering a hotel room as an incentive.  Nicole's friend, Doug, was also on the line, adding to the awkwardness.  The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive comments and jokes.  Jason ultimately hung up, upset and embarrassed, expressing his desire for a more private and romantic experience. The show concluded with speculation on Jason's reluctance, again framed in a comedic light.  The show also briefly mentioned a planned Valentine's Day event intended to help virgin women lose their virginity.

[00:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:30]  What a creepy mess.  It's just bad.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Unfortunately, we're just horrible dullards.  And we got Van Halen reuniting here.  We got some audio.  Yeah.  This is a disaster waiting to happen.  Now, wait.  It's David Lee Roth.  It's Eddie Van Halen.  Alex Van Halen.  Alex Van Halen.  And Wolfgang. 
[00:05:00]  And Wolfgang.  Wolf.  Wolf.  Which pretty much is the three family members against one retard.  Yeah.  David Lee Roth.  So that whole dynamic isn't going to work very well if there's ever some kind of problem between David Lee Roth and Eddie.  Yeah.  The other guys, who are they going to back?  Yeah.  They're going to back the Van Halen name.  You know, I'm reading a book and they mentioned Led Zeppelin and Robert Plant and they asked Robert Plant, why didn't you ever reunite using John Bottom's son, Jason Bottom? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And Robert Plant just goes, because Jason Bottom isn't as good of a drummer as his father was.  Yeah.  I'm like, ooh, ooh, that's a little nasty to say.  But you want to hear some audio from the end?  Wait, now, what is Wolfgang playing?  The drums?  No, he's playing the bass.  The bass.  He's doing Michael Anthony's part.  Michael Anthony's part.  Michael Anthony was also the one that threw all the high vocals in. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  On top of Sammy Hagar's vocals and David Lee Roth's vocals.  Very high.  He could sing very high.  Yeah.  And that's kind of the trademark Van Halen sound, that real high harmony over the vocals.  So who's going to do that?  Maybe Wolf.  I don't think Wolfie can do that.  My mother's Valerie Bertinelli.  And she's losing weight.  I see her in the Fatty Girl commercials.  She's losing weight with Kirstie Alley. 
[00:06:30]  They eat salads together.  She'll be backstage with Mackenzie Phillips.  They get the green apple splatters together every afternoon from the food they're eating.  But they're losing weight.  I realize this is sacrilege.  I just never dug Van Halen.  No.  They don't suck, obviously, but I just never.  For the time when they first came out, especially, they were huge.  Growing up, I loved Van Halen.  You can't deny it.  And everyone knew how to make the little logo on their freaking notebooks.  Then they alienated some of the listeners, but got some new ones when they brought in Sammy. 
[00:07:00]  And then, you know, that era, that whole thing was over.  Yeah.  Done with.  Goodbye.  What'd they do that was good, though?  My favorite Van Halen sound.  And the cradle will rock!  I like Panama's my favorite.  Running with the devil!  They did a bunch of, they had a bunch of hits, man.  That's okay.  Jamie's crying, I never liked him.  Jamie's crying.  I just never liked.  A bunch of cool riffs. 
[00:07:30]  Hot for teacher, are you?  Well, I got a little.  Yeah, okay.  That was toward the end.  Yeah, Jamie, that was toward the end.  That was toward the end.  We're talking about the first few were undeniably great albums.  Yeah.  I don't, I don't.  Ain't talking about love.  How'd that go?  Oh, my God.  Crank up ain't talking about love.  Come on.  Can you do it?  Oh, era.  Is it on?  Am I not the only one realizing that he's a stupid guy?  Yeah, what about eruption, man?  I love how he looks.  Come on.  I love how he looks over here.  Is it on? 
[00:08:00]  Because he needed time to kill.  Ooh.  Sauce, assassin open.  Yeah, he is.  It's on over here.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, you're playing other clips from there, so, you know, what happened?  Which one did you say?  Eruption.  I mean, some of Eddie's great guitar work in that.  Yeah.  All right.  Iraq, you know, timing's everything.  Hold on, Iraq, what's going on?  Don't worry about it.  Are you pushing the button?  It's not working?  Talk.  It's playing right here.  I see it.  The board's on, and nothing's coming out.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  So, Eric's saying that he is doing his job, but something is getting fritzed. 
[00:08:30]  But he's not doing his job, because he already played stuff from over there, and it came  out perfectly.  What happened?  So, he fiddled.  Did you get mayo on the board?  Fiddling.  All right.  Screw it.  Fiddling.  Here's Van Halen.  Roth says, this is the press conference we all thought we'd never see.  I love Van Halen.  And now we don't care.  But, this is a complete disaster.  Disaster in the making.  Waiting to happen.  And no one really did.  This is the press conference that you probably never thought that you would see happen. 
[00:09:00]  After an on-and-off, often tumultuous 30 years, a new version of the band Van Halen  has emerged from the rock and roll ashes.  What?  At a news conference today.  Why is this idiot talking?  Original frontman David Lee Roth for the first time since the flamboyant singer quit more  than 10 years ago.  Self-important douche.  After Roth left in 1985, he was replaced for the next decade by Sammy Hagar.  Sammy Hagar.  Kind of did that.  The Southern California rockers say not to think of this as a reunion. 
[00:09:30]  This is a brand new band.  We are a band, and we're going to continue.  Yes.  Is that Eddie?  Yeah.  It's a whole new beginning.  Oh, no.  It's a whole new beginning.  Oh, boy.  It's a whole new beginning.  Well, it was that.  He's got in his sinuses.  He's got some big problems.  Oh, he has cancer in the sinuses?  I don't know.  He's got some problems.  He can't breathe through his nose.  He's got half a tongue.  You know what this means to us? 
[00:10:00]  The concert goer.  What?  We're going to have to politely clap for new songs that they're going to attempt to sing  for us, and we're going to be like, oh, we're not here for this crap.  This is off our new upcoming album.  Shut up.  Play the hits.  Rob called Rebirth.  Right.  Yeah, man.  Here's Rebirth.  Feature Wolfgang on the bass.  We're calling this one 2007.  Running with the Devil 2007.  Yeah.  We'll update one song, and there'll be one song called, we're back, and strong as ever. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, if they do that.  We're back.  You don't work.  And strong as ever.  Oh, God.  Together forever.  We're back.  Oh, shut up.  You're making me cringe.  We're back.  With David Lee Roth and Eddie back to back, like singing into the same mic.  That's right.  Like they're back.  He tries to do a karate kick, and his prostate falls out.  And then Wolfgang comes over and helps everything. 
[00:11:00]  Wolfgang.  And Eddie goes, I cannot reach the stamp.  And he licks the stamp, Wolfgang, for me.  Why am I talking German as Eddie?  Because if you name your son Wolfgang, you've got to throw the accent in there.  Oh, my God.  If you're known for classic rock, do us all a favor.  No one wants to hear your new crap.  Throw it on the internet, and maybe some fans will find it.  Yeah.  Drop something.  Holy Jesus.  What is going on around here today?  What happened?  He knocked over E-Rock's lunchbox. 
[00:11:30]  What the hell, Tim?  Mump's neck.  That was Tim this time.  Exactly.  Yeah.  He said something about Tom and just kicked his speaker off.  He goes, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  The speaker went flying.  It certainly did.  I love that we have a professional loud.  Very loud.  It's ruined the studio Tuesday.  Yeah.  All right.  See, we talked about rock and roll.  It just gets nutty in here.  Yeah, you've got to kick over a speaker.  Yeah, that's what it was. 
[00:12:00]  He was just, like, being cool.  Watch how crazy I'm going to get.  Oh.  Oh, you spent some water on the floor.  A little water on the carpet.  Look at that thing.  That's never going to be the same there.  No, it worked out.  Let's see if we can get some real, like, Van Halen clips here.  Usually when a band comes back like us, it's Rockers with Walkers.  And this is everything but.  Meet us in the future.  He's killing.  All right.  You know, the whole Rockers with Walkers.  Let's break this down a little bit.  Yeah, please.  Name one band that came back as Rockers with Walkers.  Literally?  That old gag. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  Let me think.  The Moody Blues.  Even the Rolling Stones, man.  Yeah.  Freaking, supposedly Mick Jagger still, like, is on a treadmill 10 miles a day.  Yeah, he runs around the stage like a nut.  We saw him at Giant Stadium about a year.  Well, now it's probably close to two years.  That guy was running all over the stage.  And he's pushing, what, 70 at this point?  The Hoon, right?  The Hoon.  Roger Daltrey's still singing and running around the stage.  Name one band that came back as Rockers with Walkers. 
[00:13:00]  Actually, Rackers with Whackers.  Usually you see, like, your favorite band from back in the day and you go,  Dan, the lead guitarist is younger than me.  What happened?  They just sneak a young guitarist in there and no one's looking.  That's what the dude with Wolfgang.  Wolfgang.  Isn't Wolfgang fat, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, Wolfie's a little fat.  I think he got some of his mother's genes.  With the pudgy, pudgy Valerie Bertinelli Lifetime Network genes.  But meet us in the future, not the pasture. 
[00:13:30]  Van Halen hadn't intended to announce a tour over this year.  But guitarist Eddie Van Halen entered rehab.  The band didn't want a tour until everyone could give 100% of the money to what?  In the immediate future, none of us want to give you less than our best.  And we are at our best.  No, you're not.  Oh, my God.  Don't even say you're at your best.  How can you say you're at your best?  You're not at your best.  I would guess 19...  What year do you want to say?  79? 
[00:14:00]  81, maybe.  All right.  Yeah, 79.  I would go in 1979.  They were at their best.  You're at your best.  This is nowhere near their best.  At your best?  You're not at your best.  David Lee Roth dresses like your father.  That's not what you want to see when you're thinking Van Halen at their best.  Hot for teacher in a sweater vest.  Right.  We're not.  We're not.  We're not getting more.  I want to get more.  Look at Wolfgang.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Who's that fat kid? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, he's the fat kid.  There's a...  He's got Valerie's shape, man.  That is Valerie Bertinelli.  There's a kid that was never denied dessert, huh?  He looks like a young Ron Bennington.  Wow.  It's Wolfgang and Fez.  He looks like a young Ron with a guitar.  We're at our best.  A band like this, particularly coming after an absence of this amount of time, can get  away with a lot if only you do one tour. 
[00:15:00]  That's not our ambition here.  This is not like the police.  The idea is that this will continue on and on.  All right.  Now...  Oh, boy.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, boy.  The police pretty much got back together for money.  We all know that.  Yeah.  But the police tour will kick this tour's ass.  It has been.  My brother went and saw the police and said it was amazing.  Oh, really?  Because Sting hasn't lost a goddamn thing as far as his singing goes.  The band sounds great.  He goes, it was like you were seeing the police from years ago. 
[00:15:30]  You know?  They don't look like they're falling apart.  And the ticket was a lot of money.  So they're making a fortune.  Yeah.  Now this, he's talking about this being one tour and then going on and on and on, huh?  Well, because then they'll probably play, you know, they'll come up with some new songs.  Well, future not to pass here.  Which song will they come up with?  Well, there was a...  I forget how to...  I wish I could remember your new song.  I thought that song I just sang, though.  We're back.  We're back.  And we're as good as ever. 
[00:16:00]  We're back.  Together forever.  We're back.  Me-a-la-la-la-la-la-la.  A little guitar thing.  Me-a-la-la-la-la-la-la.  And Fat Boy will come in.  Boop-a-dee-boop-a-dee-boop.  Fat Boy.  Fat Boy.  Fat Boy.  It's Fatty.  Maybe.  Valerie Bertinelli's on TV.  Look.  Oh, it's Jenny Craig.  Maybe we could come up with potential Van Halen songs for these guys.  Future Not the Pasture, like he just said, that might be the title of the album.  Future Not the Pasture. 
[00:16:30]  How about like emissions?  Are they Journey?  It should be Future Not the Pasture, and they're in a cow pasture, and Eddie is cutting  off a cow's tongue trying to use it.  All right, we get to...  We learn about Wolfgang here.  Helping the band continue, its latest edition, Eddie's 16-year-old son, Wolfgang.  It's a great gig.  I just like started playing one summer, and I just sort of slipped in. 
[00:17:00]  As for the thought of a 16-year-old hitting the road for a full-blown rock and roll tour,  Wolfgang defers to his mom, actress Valerie Bertinelli.  Let's just say she's watching me closely.  Oh, boy.  Interesting.  He's going to be all effed up on the road, huh?  Craig, good luck to you.  Couldn't you get a bassist?  Like, why would you use your 16-year-old kid?  To keep the money in the family.  Right, right.  It sounds like this has a lot to do with money.  Eesh.  Why pay a bass player when you can keep the money in the family? 
[00:17:30]  And he's got the Van Halen name.  I think they're just going to pay David Lee Roth like a per diem.  And the family keeps all the money because it's their name.  And the kid's going to be a hit every time he hits the stage with his father.  Oh, they're going to have to do like a solo off.  You think like Eddie will do something and then Wolfie will have to do something and then Alex will do something on the drums.  It'll be a big family thing like friggin' old age Hanson.  I'd say there's some kind of handing over of the guitar. 
[00:18:00]  Dramatically, Eddie takes his guitar off and gives it to Wolf.  And Mike, with a lot of pride, hands over the guitar.  And then Wolfgang does his version of Eruption.  They'll be back-to-back looking at each other as only a dad and son can do when one is fat and one is tongueless.  I'm fat and I'm tongueless.  And we're back!  Better than ever!  We're back! 
[00:18:30]  Can we use your machine yet there, E-Rock?  I love your song.  Well, Roth promises you will know all the songs.  Well, thank God.  Oh, really?  Let's see what this is all about.  You know, there is a catalog that is as familiar as...  People to this day stop in crosswalks and act out the guitar solos in front of me in 23 different cities here.  So there's sort of a provided thing. 
[00:19:00]  You know, when the three tenors get together, you only wait for O Solo Mio and the rest of it you can barely pronounce.  With this, you know every single song, you know every guitar lick, every kick, every jump, every drum lick, and we can't afford to shirk that dude.  He couldn't have picked, like, Kaja Gugu.  Like, when Kaja Gugu plays, you know too shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy.  He picks the three tenors.  I know.  I think the people that go see the three tenors are sitting on the edge of their seats for the whole freaking...  Yeah, I think if you're going to go to see the three tenors, you know more than O Solo Mio. 
[00:19:30]  Can I tell you what I hate about David Lee Roth?  He just babbles, and no one, like...  No one challenges him on any of this crap.  You're just babbling.  I'll tell you who called on it, CBS.  And we thank CBS for that.  Hey, that's right.  What are you talking?  No one calls him.  We're sitting here.  It's ironic he mentioned the three tenors.  When his voice is shot, Eddie can't talk, but there is a fat guy, like a Pavarotti, and that's the kid.  The three tenors.  Hey, wait until you hear this next Roth clip. 
[00:20:00]  Listen to this one.  How does it feel to be on stage for the first time together in so many years?  It feels completely natural.  Strangely enough, after this many summers, I myself am certainly more aware than ever of how valuable this band is to me in my history,  how valuable it is to the neighborhood, to the communities that this music appeals to.  And it's a lot of communities.  Cuando tú tienes, cuando tienes solamente habilidades en español, tú también. 
[00:20:30]  Sí.  It is totally blowing.  It is totally blowing our own minds, and I think it will yours, too.  It's better than it's ever been.  I grew up on this stuff.  Better than it's ever been.  I can't walk 20 meters down any sidewalk near any college campus without somebody stopping me and going,  you're that white guy.  See, no one...  Oh, boy.  No one stops Shin says that.  No one says that.  They don't.  He didn't get a laugh.  Of course, as he shouldn't have. 
[00:21:00]  And Eddie is just trying to sell it a little too much.  Look, this is the best that we've ever been.  We're the best.  This is the best we've ever been.  Could someone pick up my ear?  I fell off.  Oh, yeah.  We're back!  And we're better than ever!  We're back!  That'll be one of the songs.  Wink, wink, wink.  Yeah, the father-son doing the back-to-back guitar thing, looking at each other over for the Cream magazine shot.  Oh, look!  The guy from Kerrang! is snapping away!  Look at me!  Stick your tongue out!  I'll not do that. 
[00:21:30]  Just look at him.  We're back!  Hey, I know the Pests love betting.  Get the itinerary for the Van Halen tour and try to figure out when the tour melts down.  Okay.  And then all of a sudden they have to cancel the rest of the dates.  I say by Charlotte.  Dude, November 13th, Madison.  That's the first gig.  Hold on, hold on.  Madison Square Garden, November 13th.  No effing way.  We'll never see them at Madison Square Garden.  If you live in Canada and maybe want to see them, you best get your tickets for Toronto. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, that's the fourth one.  Because the last gigs in Vancouver, Edmonton, and Calgary, good luck to you.  I'm going to say Meltdown by Cleveland, Ohio.  All right, I'm going to say that's, wait, Thursday, September, October.  That's five in.  Five in?  Five shows in.  I'm thinking the excitement of the first couple of gigs might hold them together a little longer.  Yeah.  Maybe through, they're going to squeak halfway through October. 
[00:22:30]  I give them to Chicago.  Chicago.  Before the first big problem.  October 18th.  Boston, you don't have a shot of seeing them, man.  October 30th?  No way.  I don't know about that.  I give them, I think they'll make it through Los Angeles November 20th.  I'll tell you why.  Wow.  Because I think they'll start hating each other around where you guys are saying.  But then there's a whole run of big cities.  You got Chicago for two.  Rosemont is a Chicago for all intents and purposes.  You got Chicago.  You got Boston.  You got East Rutherford.  You got New York and L.A. 
[00:23:00]  All coming together.  Those are major cities.  Probably major money.  So you're thinking logically, though.  You're thinking money.  Let's make sure we make the money.  They're beyond that sometimes.  They can't work with each other.  After Los Angeles is Glendale, Arizona.  And then San Diego, Sacramento, San Jose, Portland.  He dives off.  Yeah, but those are all like kind of where they all live and stuff.  They'll be close to home except for Roth who now lives in New York.  But Philly's really lucky. 
[00:23:30]  Philly has the third date in.  October 1st.  Al Dukes is chiming in saying I think Cleveland is where the Roth-Hagar tour fell apart.  If that helps.  If that helps.  So they're going to try to get past Cleveland because they don't want it to happen again in Cleveland.  Hey, we got two more quick clips.  We got Roth mentioning his radio career.  Well, we all know how well that went.  And we thank Christ for it.  We ended up replacing Roth.  So this could be kind of interesting to listen to.  We decided to do everything that you expect but to make it high speed, low drag. 
[00:24:00]  Make it modern.  Make it move.  And like everything that got me fired from radio.  Did you know I was in radio?  I heard something along those lines.  Yeah, you're going to get your expectations but it's been upgraded, updated the same way  we've gone from cassette to CD, baby.  Oh, look, I just chilled out.  And why would you say updated by saying cassette to CD?  Because like CD is kind of an old term now. 
[00:24:30]  It's dope.  Yeah.  You should have said you should have went right for iPod.  Yeah, CD to iPod.  And Eddie at least had a good improv.  I heard something along those lines.  Lines.  And it's about time he jumps back in there and saying, we've never sounded better.  All right.  With my son of Wolf.  As he creepily just leaves this disgusting impression in his ice cream cone on stage.  Looks like someone put their heel in it.  Go ahead.  Lick it with your stump.  Old heel tongue. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, stupid.  He has corns on his tongue.  He sounds like the Endeavor guy.  Endeavor.  Big show Endeavor.  All right.  One more clip.  Best show ever.  We kind of got to take a break.  So let's get one last clip here.  We're back.  Better than ever.  Let's go to Detroit.  Hey.  I was wondering if David Lee Roth is going to sing his famous, running with the comb over.  Hey, Dave from Detroit gives us a funny line. 
[00:25:30]  And what is Drew and Mike doing?  Probably reading the newspaper for everybody.  All right.  The final clip from the press conference.  Here we go.  The questions are pursuant to Valerie Wolf's mom, Valerie Bertinelli.  Everybody knows who she is and stuff.  And the next obvious question will be, how am I getting along with Valerie?  And I want to say that now we're getting along fine.  The first time we ran into each other up at the studio, she had the kind of look like  she was down at the family gym and the devil showed up looking to throw the ball around. 
[00:26:00]  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  I wish we were there.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  You, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Boozy, boozy, bop.  Titty, bop.  I don't know.  What is he saying?  He just babbles.  No one calls him out on any of this crap.  Now, forgive my, was Valerie and David a problem back in the day?  I would gather. 
[00:26:30]  Well, why would he even bring her up?  Because she's, like, separated from Eddie, I'm hearing.  Unless they got back together.  Yeah, who has a family gym?  Going to the family gym.  Can I hear that quote one more time?  Sure.  Because I'm going to try to decipher it.  All right, let's go.  The questions are pursuant to Valerie, Wolf's mom, Valerie Bertinelli.  Everybody knows, you know, who she is and stuff.  And the next obvious question will be, how am I getting along with Valerie?  And I want to say that now we're getting along fine.  The first time we ran into each other up at the studio, she had the kind of look like 
[00:27:00]  she was down at the family gym and the devil showed up looking to throw the ball around.  The devil showed up looking to throw the ball around.  Why would the devil do that?  He probably hates sports.  Yeah, and it's a gym and the devil's pretty buff on his own.  Yeah.  He can't throw a ball with those silly hooves.  Yeah.  He's a lousy, he's a great exterminator of the masses.  He's a terrible free throw shooter.  Can't even run down the court. 
[00:27:30]  He's tripping over his tail the whole time.  Oh, he's got that tail.  He tries to stuff with one of his horns, gets stuck in the net.  Yeah, he goes to do defense and he slides on his hooves.  Yeah, his stupid hooves.  He goes down like when you see a horse fall on something slippery, looks all silly, and  he's the devil, so he's mad, and he kills eight million people.  You know what happens with David Lee Roth, too?  Like, he says his crap and people start laughing because they don't want to be the ones not  laughing.  The ones not laughing at David Lee Roth?  Right, because, well, everyone else is laughing.  I better laugh.  He might have gotten away with it when he was babbling to Nina Blackwood on MTV, but now he's 
[00:28:00]  not that guy anymore.  He doesn't have that charisma.  Oh, Valerie is kind of making sure Wolfgang is okay on tour, so she will be going on tour  to watch after her son.  Oh, that's great.  Your divorced wife.  Take your divorced wife and the singer that you hate and she hates on tour.  Oh, this is rock and roll all the way.  If Valerie's coming, I'm going to have to back off from Chicago.  So, Bailey Roth doesn't get along with Valerie. 
[00:28:30]  Valerie doesn't really get along with Eddie anymore.  Hello, Cleveland.  Yeah, I say Cleveland.  By Cleveland, it's over.  I don't know, though.  Philly has a way of really effing things up.  That's October 1st.  Dude, how is that rock and roll?  You're bringing your...  Could you imagine bringing your divorced wife on our little comedy tour?  On our comedy tour.  Because you so happen to have some kind of son or something that is 16 years old and he's  getting into comedy?  Oh, my God.  And she's there just to make sure he's safe on tour? 
[00:29:00]  Holy Jesus.  How is that going to work for these guys?  How...  Well, she better get used to the C word.  That's all I would have said.  How about this?  How about this?  For everybody listening out there, your divorce.  Imagine your divorced wife coming to your job.  And not those couples that get along after the divorce.  Right.  Like in a movie couple.  The guy comes over and still helps out.  You need help with that door hinge?  I'll get it for you.  You know, I remember.  And then they reflect on a nice, fun moment they used to have.  Look in each other's eyes. 
[00:29:30]  Realize it still wouldn't work.  And then he goes back off somewhere.  Instead of thrusting that screwdriver into her chest like he should want to.  And Eddie's currently dating the band's PR woman?  Ugh.  What does her nationality have to do with this?  I know.  There's nothing rock and roll about this reunion.  This has all the makings of a bomb.  You need...  An unstable bomb at that...  You need alcohol.  You need who is...  Who is...  No, this is better than ever.  Oh, yeah.  Better than ever.  We're back! 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  All right, we got to do.  Together forever!  Together forever.  Ugh.  We're back!  And he'll do like a little kick and spin in the video.  And his woes!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whoa!  You'll think we never left!  We're back!  Ow!  All right, we got a break.  We're really, really late.  Trust me.  We can go on forever.  We'll be back!  And we'll be better than ever!  We'll be back!  O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony's show. 
[00:30:30]  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony's show.  Did I just fart?  Bringing people right around.  This is especially for the rest of America.  Wake up with Whoopi in the Morning.  What?  I nodded off when you said the title.  What?  What station is running her?  WKTU?  Didn't they learn from Free FM's mistake of having David Lee Roth?  Weren't they paying attention? 
[00:31:00]  Jesus.  Celebrities cannot do radio.  Whoopi Lee Roth.  It's very rare.  Celebrities cannot do radio.  Very rare can a celebrity do radio.  They have to have a lot of personnel.  I'll tell you one guy that can do it.  Because they don't have the work ethic.  Danny Bonaduce.  That guy was able to at least do radio because he's energetic.  But he wasn't a celebrity.  He was on TV for a few years.  When he was 10.  When he was a kid.  But he didn't have radio experience, kind of. 
[00:31:30]  He kind of got thrown into it.  I'm talking A-list, B-list celebrities.  When you get down to the C and the D-list celebrities,  they don't have many choices.  But someone like Whoopi.  Mike Luckenland?  He could easily do radio.  There you go.  He could easily do radio.  He's not a real celebrity.  Well, he doesn't want to talk about what a train wreck his life is, too.  Most celebrities aren't willing to do that.  That's true.  Yeah.  Right.  He's just got that crappy voice and everything.  And he's pretty good.  I'm talking more like David Lee Roth and Whoopi Goldberg.  And there's a whole list of other big celebrities that have tried radio. 
[00:32:00]  And they just can't get it done.  They can do it for like two, three weeks.  And then they realize, holy crap, I have nothing else to talk about.  And it's a lot of work.  And it's a lot of work.  And I don't feel like working hard at anything, especially radio.  I don't feel like getting up at four in the morning to do this.  Actors used to have a lot of downtime.  Right.  It's going to be another disaster.  How is Whoopi going to fit in any of the celebrity shindigs in the evening when she's got to  wake up at an ungodly hour to do morning radio? 
[00:32:30]  And it's another dopey radio station that just says, no, all you have to do is show up.  We got a radio guy in there.  All you have to do is show up, turn the mic on, and just ride it out with them.  Yeah, that's it.  That's all you got to do.  It's easy.  You guys want to hear some Whoopi in the morning?  All right.  Here we go.  Here was their big promo that was stating that Whoopi was coming to town.  Right.  Philly, you're so lucky you don't have to listen to this drivel.  They do on our show, though, now.  Well, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  We share.  Oh, we want to share with the rest of America how awful this is.  So this was the teaser promo, okay?  You know, when a radio station changes or they're bringing in a new personality, they  got to build the excitement.  The excitement must build.  This is how they were building the excitement for Whoopi coming to town.  How excited am I that we are in KTU?  I love this station.  I love it.  It's the premier dance station in the country.  We are building a new morning show.  That's right.  You and me, baby.  You and me.  Pass me that jackhammer.  That's it? 
[00:33:30]  What happened?  Is that it, really?  It could have just been it.  Is that real?  The end.  No, no.  No?  Yeah, that's it.  Pass me that jackhammer.  Because they're building.  No, it didn't crap out.  That's it.  All right.  That's it.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's it.  They sound very excited.  They're building a new station or a new show.  So, hand me that jackhammer. 
[00:34:00]  They love the station.  Building a new morning show.  With a jackhammer.  All right.  Here's some more audio of Whoopi in the Morning here in New York City.  Good morning, everybody who is within the sound of my voice.  Woo!  It took a while to get here.  It took a while to get here and to get up and running.  Now, Cubby, they heard you before they knew it was you.  So, say good morning to the nice people.  Well, it's a pleasure to be a part of this show.  Paul Cubby Bryant, you might have heard my name.  Probably not on the level as Whoopi Goldberg. 
[00:34:30]  You're kind of like a worldwide superstar.  But I've been in New York radio almost 10 years.  And, wow, we are on the radio.  We've been talking about this for how long?  For about 17 minutes.  And the last 17 minutes have been sort of countdown.  And it's like, what's going to happen?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  All right.  You want to cut a root for it a little bit.  Yeah, a little.  Like, even as a competitor, you know, which I don't really consider a competitor.  This is just another show that I doubt we're going to be sharing much of an audience. 
[00:35:00]  Nah, she's going to be talking to the shwoogies.  Jesus Christ.  But Cubby sounds like I sounded on Opie's old B.A.B. show, just laughing at everything  and happy to be there.  Yeah, just a little overenthusiastic.  A little overenthusiastic that he's there with the whoopster, if I may call her the whoopster.  I'm hoping he does that.  But he just sounds a little too happy to be there. 
[00:35:30]  And I know there's a clip coming up where he almost comes off like a step and fetch it.  Like he's like a punching bag.  I think this is the clip right here.  Whoopi has no buttons to push.  More terrific audio from their show this morning.  I have to tell you all who are listening, there's all kinds of things that can happen this morning.  Things could just go drop out.  You don't know what's going to happen.  Plus, it's our first day.  Do you know how many wrong buttons I'm going to hit?  I hope not very many after you bragged about being so famous in New York for being on the radio. 
[00:36:00]  I never know.  If you do that, if you drop the thing, they're going to expect me to make the mistakes.  You cannot make any mistakes because now we already know about you.  Little do they know, though, you have no buttons in front of you.  All you got to worry about is talking.  I do not need a button in front of me.  I don't need anything that I can get in trouble with in front of me.  See, that's exactly what we're saying.  Yeah.  The management of KTU said, look, all you have to do is show up.  Oh, you don't have to show up.  You just show up.  When's the show on? 
[00:36:30]  You just show up like five minutes before showtime, enough to sit down, and then you leave right afterwards.  Everyone else will take care of everything.  You just got to talk.  We'll just talk about your life experiences.  People are going to want to talk to you.  They're going to call you up and ask you things.  Okay, that's week one.  Now what?  Talk about being in the movies.  Oh, and for anybody thinking, well, how do you know?  Because we've just seen it too many times.  We just saw it with David Lee Roth. 
[00:37:00]  The guys in the NAMM, the soldiers that were in the NAMM doing their second tour.  You think when those newbies, that fresh meat came off the planes, they didn't look at them  and know exactly what was going to happen to each and every one of them?  Of course they did.  When you're in the trenches.  We've seen it before.  That's why we know.  Someone is saying on the Instant Feedback, what virus is whoopee spreading?  Sickle cell?  Oh, you see?  Hey, I didn't say it.  Look. 
[00:37:30]  Or they came up with the other one that, thank God, I don't need to know about.  Where is it?  What is that?  I might even pronounce it wrong because I might.  Tay-Sachs?  Never heard of it.  Tay-Sachs?  Tay-Sachs?  The hell is that?  I don't know.  Someone that's, uh.  Sure it's not a joke?  Someone that's up on their black diseases.  It's, uh, T-A-Y-S-A-C-H-S.  Let's look that up. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Here we go.  More audio from whoopee in the morning.  One of the things that I want to talk about right now is the fact that it is the coolest  day of the year today at a high of 90.  Yeah, I know.  I don't understand.  But tomorrow and Wednesday, temperature's near 100.  And then you add the humidity, it's going to feel like 110.  Is that bad?  That's not good.  You know, look, all you have to do is stay cool.  Now, do you know things to use and take care of yourself like that?  Because you are very, I won't say very pale, but people can't see you. 
[00:38:30]  But you are definitely of a hue that needs some, you know, protection.  Right.  Meanwhile, she's walking around the station with a basket on her head.  Why are they going to be playing that stupid music underneath everything?  That's awful and distracting.  That's just, you know, to jazz it up.  Do they play music?  I don't know.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There's a little bit of talking.  A fan.  Yeah.  It's like, it sounds like they talk maybe 10 minutes per hour, 10 to 15 minutes per hour. 
[00:39:00]  Man.  And they were given like heat.  Remember those days?  They were given heat tips and all that crap, so.  Yeah, heat tips.  That's.  And here's some sunscreen talk from Whoopi in the Morning.  All right.  Do you have like a new sunscreen that's like, it's like 100 proof or something like that?  Or it's an amazing sunscreen.  Even I will use the sunscreen.  Whoopi Goldberg will use it.  I will use the sunscreen because, you know, the truth of the matter is the sun really will wear you down.  And this is a great sunscreen. 
[00:39:30]  You see what's happening, y'all.  My new teeth, I got them just for the radio.  They are loose.  And they are moving around in my mouth.  And I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them.  Hurry on.  Hurry on.  Hurry on.  Hurry on.  That's pretty hot the way you do that.  The way you adjust them.  Holy crap.  Granted, it's their first show.  Granted.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You always got to maybe give the benefit of the doubt when it's.  But she's too big of a star for them to be doing a lot of practice shows. 
[00:40:00]  And she's too big of a star for her to actually hang out with Cubby.  Yeah.  This is just going to fall flat on its face.  I've heard funnier eulogies.  Yeah, Cubby's going to call her at home.  Hey, we got to, like, do a little show prep.  Yeah, screw that.  I got to call Ted Danson.  She's not going to have the time or the energy to get this show going.  No.  Good luck.  I would like to predict four weeks, but they're going to commit to it for a while.  Yeah, they got to give him some time. 
[00:40:30]  By the end of the year, goodbye.  Goodbye to Whoopi in the Morning.  And this, it's the kiss of death when Ovi gives it.  Seen it before.  Kiss of death.  How much time you give?  Well, I don't think it should be on more than a month.  Yeah.  But, you know, they probably committed.  So probably the end of the year, unfortunately.  Probably right around Christmas would be a good time when everyone's too busy, you know,  Christmas shopping to worry about their favorite radio show. 
[00:41:00]  I would love to say four weeks, dude.  Yeah.  I would love to, but no way.  But no, no, no way.  Too much invested.  Well, it's Manners Monday on the Whoopi in the Morning show.  So I'm just going to salute those guys who, guys and gals actually, who ride around, who  take care of us in the emergency services.  I think they're terrific.  When I see them, I'm going to wave to them.  That's awesome.  So there wasn't an emergency going on.  They just helped her out.  No, they just helped.  That's cool.  They just helped for no reason.  And that's the one thing we want to really, you know, talk about how this show is going 
[00:41:30]  to be.  This show is all about good things.  Talking about stuff like that.  Talking about man.  This show is going to be about talking about good things.  You're finished.  Good things.  That's what people want to hear.  People want good things.  It's Smile Tuesday, everybody.  Make sure you smile at your fellow New Yorker today.  Don't forget.  Stupid music is so distracting. 
[00:42:00]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Stuff like that.  Talking about man.  Can we make today manors Monday?  Today is already manors Monday, but you know that you have the sheet in front of you.  What are you talking about?  I was trying to act like I just thought of it.  You are so funny.  Listen, y'all need to call us at 1-800-449-8686.  Cindy has got your first look at traffic next on KTU.  We're here.  She did not just give out the phone number to the O&A pass, did she? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, no.  1-800-449-8686.  Oh, did that just happen?  Why don't you welcome Whoopi to New York Radio.  Give her a little welcome.  I'm sure she'd love to hear from the likes of Ramon or a few other characters.  We got someone from Yellowstone on the phone.  Like Frank the Frowner perhaps might want to get through.  There's so many people.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Here's the first caller to the Whoopi in the Morning show.  The first caller I want to talk to is Danny from PA.  What line is he on?  He's on line one.  Line number one.  That's why he's the first call.  Danny, are you there?  Hello.  Good morning.  Good morning, Danny.  Whoopi is a pleasure to speak to you, Whoopi.  Thank you, honey.  You know you're our very first caller.  You should go into our caller Hall of Fame.  That's going to last.  That's great to know.  It's a two-hour drive for you. 
[00:43:30]  Are you coming in or going out of the city?  I'm coming into the city.  I actually moved to the Poconos about six years ago.  Excellent.  And I've been doing this commute for the last six years.  And I've always been trying to get into the station.  And today is a pleasure that I'm getting to the station.  Shut up!  Good morning.  Excellent.  Well, I'll tell you, we are thrilled that you called us up.  Shut up.  We want to tell you that we're going to be here every morning to help you with that ride.  We're going to be telling you good stuff.  And we're going to be giving you a big hug on your way in.  A big hug. 
[00:44:00]  But we have nothing for you for being the first caller.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  Shut up!  Huge gratitude.  But you got to talk to Whoopi Goldberg.  How cool is that?  Holy crap.  This is going to be a disaster.  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  What a stupid beat that keeps playing.  I can't get over how awful.  Over the caller.  You can't hear anything that's going on. 
[00:44:30]  All you hear is that dumb beat.  People are saying that's the music for Madagascar.  Is it?  Supposedly.  This is Brian from St. Louis.  Hey guys, how fitting is it that the music they're playing is the music for Madagascar  when the monkey things are dancing.  Oh, come on now.  That's what he's saying, man.  Here's what I think of whoopie.  Goddamn rich horse.  All right, here we go.  This was the one that made us really laugh 
[00:45:00]  and realize that she has absolutely nothing.  But I just wanted to make sure that you went to the movies.  I went to the movies.  You told me to.  You gave me a look Friday like,  if you don't go to the movies, Cubby, I'm going to whip you.  Well, that's all this is about.  Roll reversal.  I'm going to be ordering you to do things that I don't have to do.  Would you like breakfast now?  I'll be more than happy to get it for you.  Well, I know that.  But when I'm ready, Cubby, I will send you off.  Did you know that today, as we said, is a good manners day?  Do you know what the thing I want to talk about the next few seconds are? 
[00:45:30]  I'm guessing good manners.  Good manners.  Please and thank you.  You don't hear that enough.  No, you don't.  And you know something?  When we come back, because we're getting ready to go into a break,  we're going to talk about you seeing the movie.  We're going to talk about manners.  We're going to tell people what time it is.  We're just going to take people where they need to go.  Good morning.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You stink.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Please and thank you.  Wow.  If you put a gun in your mouth, I'll say, please pull the trigger. 
[00:46:00]  And after you do, I'll say, thank you.  Wow.  I kind of feel bad for Cubby.  I never thought I'd say that.  Guy in the business, 10 years, you know.  And she's not going to take any direction from anybody.  No, no.  She is so effed.  And he's got to play the punching bag, I guess.  You know.  Oh, boy.  She thinks like having manners Monday and having a nice show is going to get the job done. 
[00:46:30]  See, everybody.  Especially in New York.  Are you kidding?  Everyone can be mean or a shock jock, Opie.  See, that's probably, they sat down like.  Right.  Look, everyone else out there is doing the shock jock thing.  Why don't we do the other thing, the complete opposite?  Why?  We'll be your friendly radio show.  Because that's why shows like Rescue Me get an audience and get the people talking about it.  Lucky Louie.  And get people watching. 
[00:47:00]  Lucky Louie.  The Sopranos.  Deadwood.  Things like that.  And nice, wholesome shows end up on obscure channels like ABC Family.  Lifetime.  Ushered off to Lifetime and things like that.  Old series that couldn't make it.  Oh, because people are vicious by nature.  They don't want it.  They don't really want it thrown at them.  But they kind of like seeing people slip and fall. 
[00:47:30]  They like seeing people get hurt.  They like when the news is bad, especially in other countries where it doesn't involve us.  It makes it interesting.  It gives people things to talk about.  Hey, did you hear what happened?  Horrible accident.  It was just the worst thing.  Yeah.  No one likes nice things unless it's happening to them directly.  But no one wants to hear about it.  No one wants Manners Monday.  We should try Manners Monday a little with our callers at Opie.  Because I noticed you're a little mean to our callers.  If that guy called up that called up Whippy Show and talked about which way he drives in or out. 
[00:48:00]  You're driving east or west because this is fascinating.  How long is your commute?  Instead of going boring and hanging up on him, perhaps we should entertain the call and have some Manners.  Today should be Manners Monday.  I agree.  I think we should steal that bit immediately.  Oh, exactly.  I think this should be a more upbeat, positive show.  Because when someone says it's from Pennsylvania and you say, do you drive in and out of the city?  That's a good question.  It is.  And you've been paying attention.  Right.  I'm glad you concur. 
[00:48:30]  Thank you, Jimmy.  What chemistry between those two?  It's just magic.  And asking someone how long.  Bleach and ammonia.  Asking how long someone's commute is.  Yeah.  Especially, it's at least an hour.  Of course.  At least an hour.  That's all you need to know.  Probably two hours each way every day.  Whoopie.  It's miserable.  Because we're regular people.  We have to drive through this horse ass.  But where are you going to go with the answer?  No matter what he says, you can't make it interesting.  No.  If he says ten minutes or four hours, you're like, oh, okay. 
[00:49:00]  There's nowhere to go with that.  It's a complete dead-end question.  Well, Anthony in New York, what do you got?  Did you guys catch that part of her shtick was, when we come back, we'll tell you the time?  Yeah.  That was part of her bit, which is just.  Do you realize that?  That was a tease, by the way.  People, when you tease when you're going into break, you're supposed to be telling people something that's going to hold them through the commercials.  Breaking down Opie's 13th wall of radio here.  Right.  You're supposed to be telling them something that's going to go, ooh, you know, I might want to hear that. 
[00:49:30]  The time?  Look, don't look at your clocks, people.  Don't look at any clocks in your car.  Don't look down at your radio.  Because there's a clock there.  I want to be the one that tells you the time.  Don't spoil my bit and look at the time in the car.  Because then you can change the station.  Holy tool.  That's like when we do a radio tease going into break.  Yeah.  And you're able to look at your radio dial and it tells exactly what we're going to do after the break.  That's what she just did.  Because as soon as you say time, wouldn't you, like, pop your head up and go, hey, what time is it? 
[00:50:00]  What time is it?  By the way, what time is it?  Let me look down.  You don't tease the time.  Well, I know what time it is.  Don't have to listen to this horse crap after the break.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Whoopi.  Of Whoopi and Anthony.  Hey, we got the Whoopi calls coming in.  You guys ready for this?  No.  I'm really not.  Well, there's people just tuning in.  Hey, why don't you give the big setup, please?  Well, it's Wake Up With Whoopi.  We'd like to welcome her to New York.  It's her first day on the air over there at KTO, the station. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, look at that.  We gave her a plug.  But she's with Cubby, who he's been in radio in New York for about 10 years.  He's one of these nice jocks.  Yeah, very nice guy.  Everything has to be nice.  Never really made any.  Don't ever get mean-spirited.  Yeah.  Never really made any big news or anything, which, you know, that's fine.  You want to just have a radio career.  That's fine.  You don't have to be in the paper all the time or anything.  And he's eked out a nice career in New York over the years.  If you're in New York for that many years, I guess you've got to be doing something right. 
[00:51:00]  They boot your ass right out.  It's the number one market.  But they teamed him up with Whoopi, and I just see it as very awkward.  They're trying to make this a nice show.  Trying to make Whoopi's show the nice show, the alternative to this nastiness that's all over the air, permeating the airwaves.  So they made the mistake and gave out the phone number because they want listeners to call up.  And our pests have been calling and getting through. 
[00:51:30]  And it is the most awkward, cringe-inducing thing to listen to because they don't know how to handle it.  I mean, people call us, and when they bitch about us, we're so used to it, we know just to go right into attack mode, it's very hard to get at us on this show.  We have a defense.  We have a great offense.  We're a great team here.  They fall apart.  They just wet themselves.  And it's over Johnny. 
[00:52:00]  A couple of calls in, they're already cracking.  She tries to get serious.  Yeah, tries to scold us and the callers.  And it's just cringe-inducing.  She doesn't get it.  No.  Well, we'll explain after you hear the audio, but here's the first clip.  A Ramon call got through.  We're going to go to line seven to Tony now in Garden City.  He's an EMS man.  Oh, we love the EMS.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up?  Pretty good.  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I was doing my round in Nassau County.  I go into a Dunkin' Donuts for the morning coffee. 
[00:52:30]  They have the show on.  And they said, Ramon!  You don't want to make me feel...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I felt that one coming.  Did you?  Did you feel it coming?  Did you?  Did you feel it coming?  It just...  The wheels fall off at the slightest little problem there.  And this is...  I felt...  This is only the beginning. 
[00:53:00]  That was a speed bump.  And all of a sudden, she starts driving like Harry Chapin.  So...  Hold to yourself, Whoopi.  Well, she...  We got to her.  So here's the next bit of audio.  Yeah.  You know what's cool?  We're a brand new show.  Today's our first day.  All right.  Hold on.  I got to address that because I forgot what Cubby does here.  If you're on the air going, you know what's cool?  You know what's great?  After you've just been bashed, it's not cool.  And it's not great.  You are miserable.  Right.  You're smiling and pretending you're eating cotton candy while that uncle breathes whiskey 
[00:53:30]  into your face from the back.  That's what you're doing.  Don't dissociate your silly goose.  You know what's great?  You know what's funny?  At this point, you realize you don't have the chops to deal with this.  And it's early day one, and you're already at a loss of what to do.  Yeah.  You've just walked into the new job, and your greeting has been a kick to the teeth.  And you're wiping your gums in the sink going, you know what's great?  That other guy thought I was such a threat to his new job that he kicked me in the mouth.  Right.  And you don't know which other worker is going to kick you in the teeth throughout the rest 
[00:54:00]  of the day.  You know what?  You have lemons.  Just eat them as lemons.  Stop trying to make lemonade.  You don't have any sugar, stupid.  Get a sourpuss.  Exactly.  The glass is half empty.  Exactly.  No, it's not half full.  It's half empty.  And if it is half full, it's half full.  You know what's really cool?  When you're trying to say something funny.  Isn't it funny?  Isn't it great?  When you flob a line. 
[00:54:30]  I hope they think the glass is half full, and it is, with AIDS.  They're going to come up with reasons why we're doing this.  It's the audio you're about to hear.  Let me make it perfectly clear for the listeners out there that don't really know about us yet.  We're just bored.  Yeah.  This spices up our morning.  It spices up the listening pleasure, and it gives the pest something to do.  A homework assignment.  That's all it is.  We're not thinking past that. 
[00:55:00]  We're not thinking, uh-oh, this is competition.  We like making people miserable.  Yeah, it's fun.  And one reason, because we're bored, and we have to fill up five hours of radio a day.  And because her last name is Goldberg, which is Jewish.  And we're gay.  As you know, when I get drunk, I don't like the Jews.  Oh, she's got the double whammy.  She's got the old Sammy Davis.  All right, here we go.  So they're going to explain what's going on here to their listeners, getting it all wrong.  You know what's cool?  We're a brand new show. 
[00:55:30]  Today's our first day.  Yeah.  But a lot of other radio stations are nervous about us, and they're talking about us.  Isn't that funny?  You know what?  How would I be nervous?  We got nothing to leave.  I'll tell you why we're nervous, because people who are listening to that dreck are  going to throw their radios out the window and not be able to tune in and hear us, and  it will affect us in the ratings.  They'll kick their radios.  Another whoopee clip.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And a cubby clip. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  There we go.  And they're talking about us.  Isn't that funny?  You know what?  How would I be nervous?  We got nothing to lose.  But you know what bugged me about that?  What?  Don't use the MS guys, man.  Don't use the MS.  When did we use the MS guys?  EMS guys.  Oh, I thought multiple sclerosis guys.  But she says MS.  No, she said don't use the MS.  She said EMS.  Yeah, but all I hear is MS. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I guess she's trying to talk like ghetto.  No, here's what that is.  That's the cubby, and that's for the cello tie-in.  Right.  Do you want to go with the MS?  Oh, wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  There you go.  Great.  Tying it all together with a disease.  Old twisted root body with her stupid Mouseketeer's ears on.  That's right.  Have some peanut butter.  M-I-C.  See me walk?  No.  K-E-Y.  Why?  Because God hates me.  She thinks we're messing with the EMS guys. 
[00:57:00]  Go screw them.  This is the furthest tie-in she could do is that to try to get to us by saying we're goofing  on the EMS guy.  The EMS guy, the guy used the character to get through to our show.  Didn't goof on the EMS guy.  Right.  Didn't say anything bad about EMS.  Right.  Here we go.  Buddy, you know what?  Why would I be nervous?  We got nothing to lose.  But you know what bugged me about that?  What?  Don't use the EMS guys, man.  Don't use EMS to get on the radio. 
[00:57:30]  Because here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  There are other folks out there.  Some of them are good and some of them are not.  We are no threat to anybody.  We're just doing a show that we want to be doing.  Howard understands that.  That's my friend.  These other people, they're not worth the dust Howard walks in.  So whatever they're doing, let him keep doing them.  Maybe you can talk to him about strategy.  Don't mess with the EMS.  Don't mess with the EMS.  Because you know what, y'all?  You other guys who are messing with us, they know where you are.  You're listening. 
[00:58:00]  Why did he laugh at that?  What does that mean?  You don't want to mess with the EMS, folks.  You don't want to mess with the EMS.  We're not messing with the EMS.  Who messed with the EMS?  What are they going to do anyway?  Show up and give us oxygen?  Yeah, they're going to put a little mask on us.  Don't mess with us.  We'll come over and swab your arms.  Watch it.  Watch it, Buster.  I'll put one of those neck braces on you.  You won't be able to turn your head.  Just showing she's completely clueless.  Poor Cubby having to laugh at that.  She said something that rhymed.  Don't mess with the EMS.  Well, that was almost funny.  I better laugh at something this morning.  And then Cubby tried to rhyme. 
[00:58:30]  He said, you know, I hope ratings get bigger because I'm on the radio with...  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on me.  Shame on you, Jimmy Norton.  What?  I beeped it.  Shame on you.  I could beep and talk at the same time.  Oh, shame on you.  People don't understand that.  Do you mean I really probably didn't say anything?  You probably didn't.  Well, well.  All right, here we go.  Here's the next whoopee clip that got through.  And then we'll get an update from Doug OutDoug, one of the fine O&A pests. 
[00:59:00]  And if you want to give us a call at 1-800-449-8686, know that we're going to probably screen a little bit better because we have people trying to infiltrate.  But you know what?  Which flatters us, by the way.  It's a very wonderful thing.  It's a very wonderful thing.  But people who are unsure of themselves as human beings trying to talk for others.  Ew!  Not sure.  Ew!  God, I'm missing all the goodness.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm missing all the goodness.  I have to...  Get your ews out of the way.  You're getting your teeth kicked in, and you start to go for the psychoanalysis. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  She's now psychoanalyzing us.  Hey, you're just doing that because you're insecure.  Exactly.  You got it.  You got us.  That's what all performers are.  We love watching other people bombing.  Exactly.  Why are you a stand-up comic, stupid?  Because you're insecure.  It's a very wonderful thing.  But people who are unsure of themselves as human beings try to make trouble for others.  Waking up with Whoopi.  103.5.  And Whoopi hang and loose.  Holla.  Hang and loose.  Holla. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, ew!  Did Cubby...  Wait a minute.  Ew!  Hold it.  Did Cubby just say holla?  Holla!  I hope not.  No.  That's a misunderstanding.  No, he didn't just say holla.  We do this to get under people's skin, and we're bored.  That's the only...  We don't think further than that.  Cubby, stop it.  No, don't say holla.  You don't do that.  Unless she's trying to shave you and fight the urge to cut your throat, you don't say holla. 
[01:00:30]  Don't say holla.  We have any more coming in?  We got to take a break to catch up a little bit, but the Whoopi attack is on.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Andre 3000, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let this show die, then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  They should be shot.  Where's the midget girl?  You want to bring her in real quick?  You guys want to see this midget girl?  Yes.  Sure.  She called up yesterday.  What was her story? 
[01:01:00]  She said she's got a website that she wants to plug, and she does things with dildos and  whatnot, and she wanted to-  Is she going to put on a show?  I don't know.  All right.  That's why we automatically just say, come down.  But she's like a tall midget.  That's right.  You are a tall midget.  You're a tall midget.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Look at you.  Yeah, I don't think he qualified.  Do you have heels on?  Wow.  Wow.  You look like Tara Lipinski.  Tara Lipinski?  No, I'm just-  I found her quite a chanting.  Hi, I'm Jack.  Isn't that something?  What's your name?  Nicole Starr.  Nicole, you know Jack?  Nicole, get over here with these two guys. 
[01:01:30]  It's Corridor.  How you doing?  Nice.  Wow, she has short little arms, so she is-  She's commenting on limbs or nothing?  Wait, you see what happened, Carl?  Now you guys are sharing them.  She's so nice to-  Look at him.  Well, you talk.  You're on the radio.  Is she going to do something like, you know-  I don't know.  Take the coat off a little and let's get a look at you.  Because I haven't seen this since-  Yeah.  She's more little girl than midget, you know what I mean?  Yeah, this is-  Does that make you hot, Patrice?  No.  But she reminds me of my daughter, and I owe her money, so I'm dodging her. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, my God.  All right, Nicole.  Four six.  You know Hank?  The angry dog?  Yeah, you said that.  Yeah, the dead guy.  I know him.  He was telling me a lot to make up a website.  What, like a-  Oh, really?  He kind of got you into doing the website?  Yeah.  Is she Spanish?  She's Spanish, right?  You're-  Italian.  Italian.  With my lips. 
[01:02:30]  You like that?  Is it like a sexy website?  Yeah.  Is that the deal?  It's a nude porn shit.  Oh, really?  It's a nude porn-  How many hits do you get on that thing?  I have a couple.  Is it a couple?  A couple hits.  Good, you're in business.  There's like a pic tour, and then there's a part that you pay for it.  How do you make-  Oh, I see.  You're digging that, Patrice?  Right.  Would you-  You gotta pay for the good stuff.  Yeah, I do.  I would.  That'd be like, if you had to do a midget, this is the midget you'd pick.  That's right.  You're a hot little midget.  I know.  I gotta say.  She is.  She really is cute, man.  Can we see her naked?  Like that Total Recall midget.  Is she gonna get naked? 
[01:03:00]  Right?  You know, in Total Recall?  Does that happen on this show?  That boostie A, that boostie A.  Please do.  You wanna see this?  I will blast off tonight to a midget.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  Raw dog to a midget.  Raw dog to a midget, huh?  That's right.  That's good.  Do you do anything like stripping, or is it strictly the website?  And how did you decide, if you wanted to get into a website, to make it a porno site?  It's me.  No, this question's for Jack Black.  I'm teasing, of course. 
[01:03:30]  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm at you.  Was it?  I want to see a naked midget.  Patrice, now Patrice is just like, I want to see it.  You guys gotta do your job.  I want to see a naked midget.  I swear to you, I want to see it.  You really want to see a naked midget.  I really want to see it.  I don't know how much money I got.  I want to see it.  Would you be willing to disrobe for Patrice here?  We will plug your website.  You will get probably.  This is Tom Hanks' son over here.  And if there's ever a time, he doesn't want that out. 
[01:04:00]  If you dance, Patrice will put wick checks in your drawers.  Hi-ho, folks.  Come on here, folks.  Black people are wearing for it.  Do you do anything like that?  Do you do any public exhibitions of nudity?  No, I have parties.  You have parties?  Yeah.  What happens at the parties?  What is that?  It's like me and a lot of girls. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  I don't really be with, I'm not with too many guys.  Right.  So you like the girls.  I know what I like about me.  You were saying yesterday, you get like dildos and whatnot.  Yeah.  Have some fun.  That's what it's all about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is she being forced to do this?  Yeah.  Are you a little nervous?  Midget slavery ring.  Are you a little nervous?  No.  Yeah, loosen up.  Well, let's see some.  Did you mean she's little and nervous or a little nervous, Voss?  I didn't quite get exactly what you said.  You mean she's really nervous?  But, uh, yeah, I know, it's like, it's like they have a loved one in a box buried underground 
[01:05:00]  and if she doesn't do this, uh, they die.  Well, let's see some.  You like that, huh?  Yeah.  That's good.  Jack, would you like to see this?  I don't know.  Not if she doesn't want to.  Right.  Exactly.  See?  She seems pretty tired.  Are you like, did you like just wake up or?  No.  You had, you came back a few before you came over?  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah.  Ah, see, there you go.  She seems a little shy to me.  She's a shy.  A little shy again? 
[01:05:30]  She seems like a nice girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think she only really gets into it when she knows the webcam is on.  Ah, that might be it.  Do you have something like, not our webcam, her webcam.  Do you have a webcam on your site?  No.  No?  She must be a little uncomfortable.  It's like a sausage fest in here.  I know.  Yeah, I know.  There's nothing really much we can do about that, but.  No, I think she's ready to take off her clothes.  Do you know what Whip Him Out Wednesday is?  Do you ever hear of that?  Yes.  She needs some encouragement. 
[01:06:00]  It's when you whip him out.  Like, you ever flash to anybody or something like that?  Because Patrice is chomping at the bit here.  I really want to see this.  I have to see this.  He's dying.  I really have to see this.  I have to see this.  To see the nude form of a midget girl.  Push her over the top, man.  What?  Push her over the top?  Meaning, she'll do it.  Well, I mean, whatever you're comfortable with.  Yeah.  Maybe just a little butt crack.  We could start with that.  That's what I'm talking about.  We'll start with that.  Be shallow, baby.  Be shallow.  You're naked on this website?  Yeah.  Oh.  So, then, would you have a problem with maybe showing your nude form to these gentlemen? 
[01:06:30]  Maybe we should all get naked, and that'll make her more comfortable.  What would you like to see?  Nobody wants to do that.  We would actually like to see you completely naked, yeah.  Yeah.  If that's, you know, acceptable to what.  Jack Black will get down to his tighty-whities like he does in Orange County.  That's as far as I go, though, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you say, Nicole?  Go to Full Monty.  That's good.  Well, plug your website.  Your butt crack was on TV on the bicycle when you were riding it down one of the streets  of Manhattan.  They fuzzed it out, though, a little bit. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, but there were people snapping pictures all on the sides of the road.  They're like, dude, I got Jack Black's ass.  I know.  A lot of people have my ass.  That's the last time I show my ass.  Yeah?  For that money.  Probably not.  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  Yeah.  What's her name?  What's her name?  Nicole.  Nicole.  Nicole Star?  Right.  How old a girl are you?  18.  You're 18?  Oh, my God.  Hey, there you go.  Teen midget.  That means she's 16.  Teen midget.  She looks older, too.  Naked teen midget.  That's a backhanded compliment. 
[01:07:30]  No, I mean, like, sexy older, you know.  Oh, you like that?  She looks older?  Because 18 isn't sexy, boss?  You should try to back up on that one.  Yeah, look at him.  He's in a ditch.  We meant older like...  I said we'd get it home.  29.  Let's get it home.  Yeah, everyone's going really crazy.  Okay.  You want...  A lot of people say I look like Bridget the Midget.  Bridget the Midget.  Sure.  Well, you're her height.  And you're a midget.  You want us to dim the lights a little?  Maybe some music?  You want to get up on the table? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, get her up on the table.  Patrice, lift her up.  Lift her up on the table.  Come on.  Here come daddy.  Lift her up on the table.  Colin, you'll never forget us.  Trust me.  Come on.  This will be great.  You need help?  All right.  Nicole, what do you say?  Let me see what she's wearing.  She's got leather pants on.  You're wearing little platform shoes.  She's got little platform shoes.  Look at that.  All right.  Get her up on the counter, man.  Wow.  How much taller does that make you?  About four inches? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, man.  All right.  Wow.  She's got the tattoo on her rear.  How do you see that?  I just got a glimpse.  Do you?  What is it of?  Here, turn around.  Let's see that.  Look at that.  What do you think, Patrice?  That's like the rock and roll tattoo.  Crack is a little far down, but I want to see.  It's a little far down.  I thought I was going to see Crack, but then she has the longest back for a midget I've  ever seen, which makes her more sexy.  The tattoo going there.  That looks hot.  Yes.  Steve.  I like that.  Get her up on the counter there.  Lift her up.  Come on, Nicole.  And then make sure she got... 
[01:09:00]  There you go.  Steve, pick her up.  There we go.  Wow.  Hey, that's a fine ass.  She doesn't fit.  She doesn't fit.  She doesn't fit.  Get the light out of her eyes.  She doesn't fit.  It's like an interrogation.  All right, Nicole.  Let's see what you got.  Nicole, let's see what you got there.  Well, just make sure...  I got you.  Yeah, make sure she doesn't fall.  Yeah, if you want to take your shoes off, you'll be a little shorter.  I'm just here in case you fall.  Yeah.  No, you're there for a lap dance, you idiot.  All right, Nicole, if you would just show Patrice what you... 
[01:09:30]  You know.  Show them what you got.  I feel like I'm begging here.  Yeah, go ahead.  I think she's a little slow or something.  I don't know what's going on.  There you go.  That's better.  All right, let's go, Nicole.  There we go.  I mean, she's built like a girl.  Come on, Colin.  You know you want to see this.  Of course she's built like a girl.  Who doesn't?  You know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  If you're going to fall, just fall into the big black sofa.  I don't know.  Are you going to have trouble taking the shirt off at the ceiling?  Let's see.  Yeah.  See, that worked good. 
[01:10:00]  All right, Nicole.  Whenever you're ready.  Yeah.  If you want to take the shoes off.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll make it easier because, boy, those make you taller.  Those are like eight inches.  My God.  You're quite a lot taller with those shoes on.  She fits now, though.  There they go.  Because before she had to, you know, her head was down.  Look at the size of those feet.  All right, she's there.  Now she could stand up on the console without any problem.  She's a lot shorter after she took the shoes off.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, just do your thing.  Let's see what we'll... 
[01:10:30]  Okay, you know what?  Let's just see what we'd see on the website.  Sure.  That's it.  You like that.  Patrice is digging this.  There we go.  She's unbuttoning the top.  A little lace number.  A little black lacy number.  Red and bra pants.  There you go.  She's wearing a red bra.  And panties.  That's good.  She's taking that top off.  I think.  Are you taking that top off?  There she goes.  Careful.  No, no, we'll keep a hold on her.  She won't fall.  She won't fall.  Last thing we need is a dead nude midget on the floor. 
[01:11:00]  Because I don't know how I'd explain that to any of my family.  To Tom Hanks.  How would Colin explain that back home?  This is so, like...  How'd your trip go?  Well, dude, I did this one radio show.  I think you should go check it out, man.  Why are you implicated in the death of a midget, son?  Dad.  Focus.  I've taken years to hone this image that I have.  And my son's killing midgets. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  What about the leather pants?  Because I'd like to see...  I see you got matching panties on under that.  Man.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What do you think, Patrice?  I've slept with worse.  Yeah.  You'll like it.  No, Abba.  I have slept with worse.  Hey, hey, helper.  I'm telling you, if you compare it to what I've slept with before, she's a seven.  It's hot.  Hey, hold her up, Steve, so she can get those pants around there so she doesn't fall.  There you go. 
[01:12:00]  Hold on to me.  Hold on to Steve, and then get the rest of those pants back down around...  I have to...  You're choreographing the whole thing.  I'm trying.  I'm trying to organize this thing.  No one's taking charge except you.  I'm trying.  Thank you, Colin.  But you want to know what?  It does seem like you're begging.  It does.  But, you know, I'm getting results.  Where the hell else are you going to see that?  You're very result-oriented.  Look at that.  That's...  I mean, what can you really say, man?  I don't know what to say, man.  This is every fantasy I've had about that little fat third grader that I went to school with. 
[01:12:30]  It's...  That's...  No, that's nice.  That is nice.  We got to go for more.  And now, do you get the...  Is it completely nude on the website?  Uh, yeah, but I have, like, different outfits on.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Well, let's see what you're sporting under that...  Yeah, let's see what the rest of that looks like.  Because I have never seen...  I got to be honest with you.  I have never seen a completely naked midget girl in my life.  Ever.  This is the first.  And, you know, we've all been around a few times.  We've been around the block. 
[01:13:00]  And I think we would all love to see a completely nude midget girl.  Am I the only one that's noticed that her socks are kind of dirty?  Yeah, she's a mess.  Why are you so saying that?  I don't know what all you guys are staring at, but I'm so fascinated by the dirty socks.  You know, Colin, we can't all have grown up in an atmosphere where your laundry is always clean.  You know, Tom Hanks is putting away your underwear.  It's...  I was looking at his socks, too.  But, you know...  See, thank you, dude.  Hey there, polo. 
[01:13:30]  This is one of the most surreal moments we've had on this show, man.  Polo or polio?  All right.  Nicole, let's see what else you can do for us here.  You would go with a full Monty.  We'd love it.  You are going to get millions of hits on your website, by the way.  Here comes the bra.  Oh, God.  We are actually going to see...  Midget boots.  Naked midget.  I think full Monty, like...  That means, like, sausage.  You know something?  Whatever it means...  I know what you're saying.  Right now, I think we're all getting the gist of what it means right now.  What?  Oh, there we go. 
[01:14:00]  Wait, turn around.  Yes.  Turn around, Nicole.  Yes.  Turn it around.  All right, Opie, take a look.  What do you think?  Yeah.  This is so dirty, man.  Come on, that rocks.  You...  Let me tell you something.  What's the...  Nips are humongous.  What's the website?  Nicole, if I can ask, here it is.  The piece de resistance.  The last thing.  If you could please, as you're facing Patrice, just like that, take down those hot, sexy red 
[01:14:30]  panties.  Let's see.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Jack Black's going to get a face full of midget ass.  Yes.  You're not going to get this on Letterman, Jack.  What do you think?  Here we go.  That's right.  What?  What's the matter?  Someone's got a spot.  What?  What's the matter?  She's kind of close to the edge.  Oh, why not?  Oh, what happened?  Wait, what happened?  I thought we were going to...  Wait, what happened?  Nicole?  You don't go naked?  You don't go all naked?  No.  No?  What are the initials on her back?  She's got a tattoo on her back. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, she's got some initials.  You got initials?  No, on your back, like your shoulder.  Up here.  T-A-D?  Tad?  Yeah.  What's that?  That was my father's name.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I think I just killed the mood.  Yeah, thanks, Colin.  I don't know.  Jeez.  What happened to your father?  I don't know.  She doesn't go naked.  That's what I was going to say.  She's half naked on the table.  A naked midget on the table.  You're going to feel bad?  Was he of average height, your father?  He was tall.  He was tall? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Really?  And your mom, too?  Yeah.  Was she tall?  She was a little shorter than my dad.  Yeah?  And then you're what they call midget?  No, what do they call what you are?  They call me midget.  Is it midget?  Yeah.  What happened to the pop?  What?  What happened to her father?  Hey, easy, chief.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  Ask her.  What happened to your dad?  Oh, he passed away.  Yeah.  He had a heart attack.  Oh. 
[01:16:00]  Opie.  Opie.  Turn down the guy.  I still want to see her naked.  Y'all can go on with this.  I know.  I want to see her naked.  We all got problems.  Six of my dogs got hit by a car.  I want to see a little bit of...  I just got to see the whole thing.  I know, right?  You got to ask her.  She's right in front of you.  It is very...  You know something?  I can't look because she does have a sad face, so I can't be a third back and look directly  at her.  Nicole, you sad?  It's very sexy.  You get a lot of guys that want to have sex with you and stuff?  Do you?  You get a lot of emails and stuff from guys that want to be with you and stuff? 
[01:16:30]  I don't really...  You're not into guys?  You're into girls, right?  Girls, yeah.  Girls.  Just girls.  You get a lot of girls that want to be with you?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I've been with like four.  You have?  You ever have a guy?  You ever been with a man?  No?  Not really.  Really?  Wow, that's something.  So you're technically a virgin.  Yeah.  It's a midget virgin.  I'm kidding.  Really?  It's right here.  But you won't do away with the panties, huh?  No.  No?  All right.  I'm not going to force any more than I already have. 
[01:17:00]  I think I've broken some laws here.  Morals.  All right.  I don't care about morals.  But you go no panties on the website, though?  Yeah.  Oh, so we could see it on the website.  So why there and not here?  Oh, do you know how many hits you're going to get on that website?  There's going to be millions of people seeing you completely naked.  Maybe she's got something going on.  Is there anything we should know about that maybe is a little weird?  No.  No.  You just don't want to pay.  That's the thing.  You know, Colin, you're right.  I don't want to go to the website and have to put on my credit card number. 
[01:17:30]  You know?  All right, Nicole.  Well, Nicole, all right, help her down.  What's wrong with Voss?  Rich got all saddled.  What's the matter, Rich?  Grab the mic.  Does it remind you of some of your jokes about your daughters?  Reminds me of my daughter.  No, there's nothing wrong.  What's the matter?  I'm just upset.  Isn't that cute?  Look at where Steve picked her up and put her down there.  I'm just upset.  That's great.  The bearded lady got naked and she didn't.  Oh, shoot.  I broke the thing.  What?  Jack's microphone just fell down.  Well, we got to take a break anyway. 
[01:18:00]  That's all right.  Nicole, you all right?  Is that right?  Hey, Nicole, can you give us a password?  Can't you give us a free password so we can check you out naked?  There isn't a free password.  No?  No.  You got to pay, huh?  It's just a pick tour.  That's it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Pick tour.  Pick tour.  All right.  But you sound depressed.  Are you depressed?  No.  You don't sound very out there.  I'm fine.  Did you?  You had a few?  Didn't you?  Yeah.  A few wobbly pops? 
[01:18:30]  It's like one.  That's all it takes.  One, yeah.  Oh, that height-weight ratio thing.  A couple tall ones.  Patrice, right?  You wanted to see that.  Yeah.  I don't care about all of this stuff.  Do you shave at all?  Do you shave at all?  Yeah.  Completely?  Hey, Nicole.  Or you leave?  Nicole.  Just my legs.  No, I mean, do you shave?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Anthony.  Completely?  Anthony.  Yes?  Maybe Nicole could give Patrice just a private little look. 
[01:19:00]  Without the cameras.  She still looks too much like a little girl.  I'm not going to get arrested.  I want to do it with all the witnesses here.  I didn't touch the little sad midget funny.  She's just saying.  All right.  Well, we should take a break and regroup.  Yes, yes.  All right.  You guys hanging for a while or do you have to go on?  What's going on?  I don't know.  Yeah, I guess we're hanging if it's...  You're asking us to hang.  You got Jack Black and Colin Hanks in the studio.  We got Nicole, the tall midget, Anthony. 
[01:19:30]  She's tall.  You're going to hang out for a little bit there, you fidget?  Yeah?  Yeah.  You got to make her smile, though, or something.  Yeah, you got to make her happy.  She's not going to smile.  You got a girlfriend, a steady girlfriend or anything?  No.  You want us to hook you up with a girl?  We could get a girl down here and you guys go crazy on each other.  I'm the Ikea furniture.  If you want to do that.  Yeah, you could use the ottoman.  Maybe need the whole couch with you.  All right.  We'll take a break and be back.  This is Rich Voss.  So you might recognize me if you were on the train today. 
[01:20:00]  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And now, The Worst.  Just pathetic.  Of Opie and Anthony.  They call it toilet humor.  Toilet humor.  Yeah, we're back with the show.  In the studio, Jack Black and Colin Hanks.  Oh, yeah.  Go check out Orange County, Rich Voss, and Patrice.  Patrice, man.  In the studio. 
[01:20:30]  And Nicole.  Do you think people know what you're saying when you say go check out Orange County?  They might think you're saying just go over and check out, like, that city.  Go to Orange County.  Now, the movie.  The movie.  Yeah.  Where you're almost naked the whole time.  Have you seen it yet?  No.  It's funny, man.  It's funny as hell.  It opens today.  I'm going Sunday.  Check it out.  Go to the movies on Sunday.  I know.  I thought you might have, like, hooked up one of those secret premieres or something.  Ah, no.  Don't you get invited to those?  We don't even get those.  And I'm not even kidding.  Like, a lot of people go, oh, we don't get invited to anything. 
[01:21:00]  And then you get invited.  We never, we don't go to any premieres.  The last thing we even went to that was sort of like that was when the Star Wars came out.  The first of the new three.  Oh, Phantom Menace.  Yeah, Phantom Menace.  And I'm like, oh, this is cool.  Is it a premiere or something?  And it's like, no, it's some kind of screening where you got to get there early before the  place fills up.  And I'm like, in the back of the theater.  It sucked.  I felt special for like a second.  They give out 10,000 free tickets and the first 300 get in? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, get in.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like Lotto.  We get those.  That's cool, right?  Have you seen the trailer for the new Star Wars one?  It looks really lame.  It looks like some kind of love story thing.  And I'm like, he's ruining the franchise.  Yeah.  He's destroying that franchise.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?  You're holding out for a hero?  I'm holding out, dude.  The Phantom Menace looked like a kid movie.  I didn't like that.  Dude, here's the deal, dude.  Yeah.  It is a kid movie.  All right, well.  That's what you're forgetting, dude.  All these people complain.  Not back in the day.  It was a kid movie. 
[01:22:00]  Dude, we were all kids when we watched it.  I don't care how old you were.  It's a kid's movie.  No, but it captured the imagination of the nation.  But you know something?  Empire?  Come on.  Nice dark movie.  Well, yeah.  And then it's followed up with goddamn stuffed animals.  This one's going to be dark, too.  I just want to know if Darth Maul's coming back.  I'll go check it out.  Yeah.  That's it.  But that's it.  Dude, they got that Boba Fett looking dude.  That Django.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He grew a bottom half like a lizard.  Really?  Or like there's just another one.  Another Darth Maul.  It looks sick. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  I just hope he goes a little darker than the we look.  We're in a chariot race thing.  There's going to be some toys.  Joe's disappointed in us.  Joe?  Why?  What's the problem, Joe?  I'm just a little upset that you guys didn't make her go all the way.  You bastards.  Yes!  You sons of bitches.  I knew you'd give us grief about this.  We were getting a bad vibe.  Yeah.  She seemed really depressed.  Dude, if you were in the room, you would have stopped.  Understand why we stopped. 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  I understand all that.  There would have had to be a beating for her to get any more off.  Yeah.  Why don't you go tell Nicole, she's still outside, that Joe's disappointed that she didn't get  completely naked.  I can't go through this again.  I don't want to.  No.  No.  I will not sit here and go through this again.  What?  She's fully dressed now.  Yeah.  I don't want to see her drowning herself in a glass of water.  Your audience expects these things.  That was really bad, man.  That was bad, man.  See, now you know.  See?  I got an idea now.  See, in the beginning, you guys were like, wait, why aren't we in on the joke? 
[01:23:30]  Now you're in on the joke.  Definitely in on the joke, man.  There you go, man.  Definitely in on the joke.  Patrice doesn't even want to comment it was that bad.  I know.  You know what?  No.  Ask Patrice.  Did you feel the people not laughing?  I know.  It's like you get a feeling out there.  How many people are listening?  You can feel the people going, huh?  That was as uncomfortable as when Colin brought up the death tattoo.  on the Amanda's back.  Dude, you know, how was I supposed to know?  I know.  Let me go to Amanda. 
[01:24:00]  Amanda saw Orange County already.  Amanda.  Yes.  What's up?  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  You saw Orange County?  Yeah, I did.  I'm actually from Orange County, but I live in Cleveland right now.  Oh, yeah?  It freaking rocked.  It brought back a lot of memories.  Oh, good.  There you go.  Thank you.  It's funny.  Yeah, and Joe, you cracked me up the entire time.  Hey, does...  Did she say Joe?  Joe cracked her up the entire time?  Who cracked you up, Amanda?  Yeah, Jeff. 
[01:24:30]  Jeff?  Jeff?  Who's Jeff?  Oh, man.  She didn't see the movie.  Jeff?  Jeff?  Joe, Jeff.  I'm excited.  Okay.  Joe, can you name one scene, one thing that happened in the movie?  Yeah, let's say this.  One thing that happened in the movie?  Yeah.  That emissions building got set on fire.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you saw it.  Okay.  What about a part that's not in the commercials?  I got a question.  Who was the fireman?  This is a good quiz.  Yeah, who's the fireman?  Who played the fireman?  Finn Stiller?  Yeah, you saw it.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, a little secret cameo. 
[01:25:00]  Amanda?  It's out of the bag.  Does Colin make it into the college?  He does.  Wait, don't say anything else.  Idiot.  Wait, I'll even dump that.  But then he dies.  And it's a sad ending.  I got to bring this up.  Look how we've never had this many girls call this goddamn show.  Colin's so cute.  You get that everywhere, right?  No.  Well, no, not really.  No.  You don't?  Dude, okay, here's the deal. 
[01:25:30]  They're all like, you know, 14.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  How old are you?  24.  24?  Yeah.  You got a chick?  What am I going to do?  No.  No?  Really?  No.  Playing the field kind of thing?  No, I've been too busy to be playing Hollywood.  Are you banging Hollywood's daughters or what?  You're going out like Russell Crowe, getting everything in sight?  No, no, no.  God damn.  Jill, what's up?  Hi, I'm a big fan of Colin's, and I'm actually over 14.  Oh, how old are you?  I'm 29.  There you go.  Yeah, big fan of Roswell. 
[01:26:00]  Thanks.  And he was my favorite character on the show.  Thanks, dude.  And, uh...  Did you just call him dude?  God damn it, that's right, Roswell.  Dude, son of a bitch.  And I've been following his work since then.  I think he's a great actor.  Thanks.  We didn't think women listened to us.  He is hot.  What do you say instead of dude when it's a...  Thanks, babe.  Babe.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Everybody's dude.  Honey.  All right, Jill.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jill.  Thanks, Heidi.  Uh, Heather.  Yes, this is Heather.  Hey.  I wanted to tell Jack thank you very much for bringing some romance into my marriage 
[01:26:30]  because...  Oh, really?  My husband, who is probably driving home right now from Indiana...  He was doing it too hard?  What?  He was doing it too hard?  Well, yes, and he happened to listen to your song, the one for the ladies.  Yeah.  And, um, he calls me one day on his cell phone and he says,  Honey, my kielbasa sausage has just got to perform.  Wait a second.  And so, I totally renovated your love life with my music?  Oh, definitely.  Oh, that's...  That's great to hear.  When we're done with the hot love making, he's like, that's freaking teamwork. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, man.  Makes it worth it, Jack.  That's weird.  That's what it's all about.  You quote the album during and after sex?  Yep.  That's awesome.  Teetering on sick.  You are our hero.  Man.  Have you seen us live before?  Um, well, we've seen a couple movies and he's, um...  Yeah.  I know he watched you on, I think, one of the late night shows this past week or so.  Yeah.  But, um...  You gotta come see the day live to get the food.  Well, you were in Cleveland not too long ago, but...  Yeah.  I happened to work night, so I missed you out, but... 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  All right.  Heather, next time, right?  Definitely next time.  We'll catch you next time.  Thanks for calling.  Oh, you're welcome.  All right.  Jeff has a...  Thanks for boning.  A lot of people with problems with the show.  In our honor.  Jeff, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And everybody.  Voss ain't on there, is he?  Yes, he is.  Yeah, what's up, Voss?  You don't remember me, do you?  Who are you?  Jeff Collins.  Newark.  From where?  I've done...  I'm a comedian.  What is this, Voss?  Your paging service?  No.  Trust me.  I'm not calling to say what's up to Voss.  So what's going on, Jeff?  How come you don't have any black comedians on there? 
[01:28:00]  You have one right next to me.  He's not funny.  You picked a hell of a thing.  I'm talking about a real comedian.  Oh, yeah.  Patrice ain't funny, right?  Patrice is killing today.  He's funny on the show.  Oh, that's about it.  Not on stage.  Oh, man.  That's you.  Oh, what?  Did I upset somebody?  He gave a wrong name.  Whoever this is, we know who it is, but he gave a wrong name.  Say your real name.  My name's Jeff.  Jeff who?  Jeff Collins.  Where do you work?  What club?  You're not a comic.  No one knows Jeff Collins.  You're saying I'm not a comic?  Shut up.  No. 
[01:28:30]  I don't even know...  Shut up.  What club you work?  Name one club you work in.  Not one.  You know what?  Comics are so petty, man.  Yes, we are.  He called just to say...  I understand.  You guys get all, like...  Nippy with each other.  Yes, we do.  Jeff Collins.  No one's heard of Jeff Collins.  No one's heard of Patrice either.  Yes, they have, stupid.  Now.  I haven't.  You said you saw me already.  You know what?  This is somebody like...  I said I saw Vaughn.  You're a jackass.  I said I saw Vaughn.  I worked with Vaughn.  Jeff, are you a black comic?  You worked with me where? 
[01:29:00]  Were you doing the fries?  Where?  Funny.  Now you're funny, Vaughn.  No, where did you work with me?  For real.  It was one time in Newark and one time in...  Jersey.  He's lying.  He's lying.  Because Newark and Jersey is stupid.  I can even...  I remember what you were wearing.  You were wearing a black jacket.  You were at Klondike Cates on Main Street.  Go back to work, you open Micah.  You bring a shut up.  You got a day job, you bum.  All right, listen.  Thank you, Jeff.  Who was he?  Jesus, man.  I don't know.  Comics.  Marie, what's going on? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm on?  Yeah.  Oh, Colin is there?  Yeah.  Oh, God, I love you.  I have such a thing for you.  Thank you.  You are so gorgeous.  I used to watch Roswell every week just to see you and those pretty blue eyes.  I have green eyes.  I just want to know.  I just want to know.  Get the color on your TV face.  I want to know why you left Roswell.  Why did you leave?  Because they killed me.  I mean, that was stupid, though.  I mean, what was that all about?  Everyone dies in that show.  They all come back.  And I've come back. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, the ghost.  I've been back on a...  Yeah.  Yeah, but once in a while.  Once in a while.  Yeah, so...  You know...  Marie, 22 years old, and you want to do Colin?  Oh, totally, but like all on in my house.  Well, thank you for your kind words.  All right, we've got to move on to the next girl that's in love with Colin.  Thank you, sweetie.  Thank you, Marie.  You were in the Band of Brothers, Colin?  Yeah.  A little bit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I missed that scene.  No, I saw Band of Brothers, but I missed your part in that.  Yeah.  You know, after they were in Bastogne, those two snow episodes, I was the one after that.  That was a great series.  It was awesome, right? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And working with your dad on that one?  Dude, he...  It was strange.  The guy who directed the episode I was in, he cast me and got the approval from my dad and  everybody, but he didn't really like...  He was back in Los Angeles and we filmed that in London, so it's almost like I wasn't even  working with him.  Oh, really?  He was like the big guy that everyone knew, but it didn't even seem like I was working  with him at all.  Yeah.  So everyone's like, what was it like?  I'm like, well, anticlimactic? 
[01:31:00]  Because I didn't even see him, you know?  And then that thing you do, right?  Yeah, dude.  Oh, you were in that?  Yeah.  But here's the thing, dude.  Internet Movie Database rocks by me.  Oh, dude.  It's so wrong.  It's so wrong.  I'm in one shot.  See?  They're amazing.  I'm in one shot and like on the box of the Cisco movie, they have that as like my big  credit, even though I'm only in it for like two seconds.  It's ridiculous, dude.  When I was on, the first time I was on Leno, they're like, okay, well, you know, we want 
[01:31:30]  to talk about, you know, how you're only in that thing you do for one shot.  I said, okay.  It's like 30, it's like literally about three seconds.  It cost them $3,000 to show.  I'm like, it's not worth that much money.  Not worth that much money.  All right.  That's funny.  Rachel.  Rachel.  Yeah.  Hey.  Here we go.  I think Jack is incredibly sexy.  Oh, here we go.  Give me a second. 
[01:32:00]  The entire end of High Fidelity when he's singing, when you're singing, outstanding, man.  That did something for you?  It did a lot for me.  I got to tell you.  Yeah.  You're a sucker for the singing, dude.  Well, thank you.  Oh, no, thank you.  Keep it up because I, you know, between the humor and, you know, the sort of wacky sexual  and the good voice.  I don't know.  Wacky.  There's a compliment in there somewhere.  It's a very good thing.  Cool.  All right.  All right, Rachel. 
[01:32:30]  Are you down with the D?  Oh, yeah.  Hell yeah.  Awesome.  I actually got the album right when it came out, and it's really good.  You've got an amazing voice.  Wait a second.  You're turning into a robot.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  Her voice started to go robotronic.  That's cell phone crap.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  That's okay.  Okay.  Thanks, Rachel.  And Eric has something to say.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, Jack.  Weren't you the guy that was flying the airplane in Waterworld?  That's true.  How'd you figure that out?  I'm covered with grease.  Yeah, I sort of looked at you and recognized you. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm in that.  You did an X-Files episode with that lightning kid?  That's me as well.  Yeah, that was a sick episode.  Yeah.  And Colin, he got shot by the Band of Brothers and just got left there.  Yeah.  No.  I'm a big fan of Black and Hell.  Don't say no to that one.  No.  You're a lieutenant in that, huh?  Yeah.  You know who I think was definitely miscast in Band of Brothers?  Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah.  When Jimmy Fallon comes driving up in the gym and goes, hey, hey, guys, I got the ammo.  I'm like waiting for a weekend update moment. 
[01:33:30]  Like, it took me out of the frigging series in a second.  A little bit, yeah.  I should go, ah, who's pal got Jimmy Fallon in this?  I don't know.  He's a really nice guy, though.  I don't doubt that.  But he was a little.  Pulling up with his Jimmy Fallon hair.  Hey, guys, I got the ammo.  It's Jimmy Fallon bringing the ammo.  I know these guys aren't getting hurt.  Jimmy Fallon traveled back in time.  Yeah.  He's back in World War II bringing the ammo.  To help the war card.  It's not easy for the comedian to make the transition.  I don't doubt it is, but look at you. 
[01:34:00]  Well, I haven't done really any dramas, really.  He's testing the waters, Jimmy.  Dude, what about, you know who did it?  The fat guy from The Honeymooners in the gambling movie.  God, I can't think of anything.  Oh, Jackie Gleason.  Yeah, Jackie Gleason in.  You're going old school.  Yeah.  He did it good, though.  You know what I'm saying?  Very dramatic.  Minnesota Fats.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  You want to meet the virgin?  Yeah, let's bring her in.  What is that story about?  Go ahead, Ant.  We have a little Valentine's Day event we're holding here, and we're taking girls now for 
[01:34:30]  it.  Yeah.  We're looking for girls that have remained virgin up until now.  They want to lose their virginity at a place of their choosing with a guy of their choosing.  We'll just set it up.  If it's a hotel room, we'll get one of the best hotels here in Manhattan.  If it's in a limo, if it's in the backseat of a car, we'll supply the car.  We'll make it the perfect way to lose your virginity.  And here's one of the girls that want to do it. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  Hey.  She is cute.  How are you doing?  She's 19.  The 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin.  Are you the one that we learned you're still a virgin, but you gave up das Dumpur?  Yeah.  She gave up the back door.  To remain a virgin defeats the purpose, doesn't it?  Wow.  That's okay.  That saved something for married.  Still pure.  That's all right.  I love that.  That's good.  You get married, and then your husband goes, hey, I got me a pure girl. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, I was a virgin.  I know you were.  It's wonderful.  Oh, but I did give up the back door.  What?  That's okay.  So where are we at?  I don't know where he is.  He's supposed to be out here listening somewhere.  You believe our boyfriend isn't here?  Your boyfriend?  You have a boyfriend?  Wait, so it's a specific guy.  Yeah, yeah.  We're not just going to, you know, Patrice, go get her kind of thing.  I can't listen for two years, but he's like, I don't know.  He thinks I'm crazy because I want to bring him here.  Wait, you've been going out with him two years, and he hasn't done?  No.  You do other things, though, right? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Who doesn't want to do it?  You guys have been going out for a while?  For two years.  For two years.  Yeah.  And this man is your existence completely?  Yeah.  Starry-eyed when you see him?  Yeah.  Yeah?  So it's the right guy.  So it's legit, then?  Yeah.  All right, that's cool.  Yeah.  If you guys did one more dirty thing, I was going to walk in.  You weren't going to agree if we were just, like, spin a wheel, and whatever guy it lands  on gets to plow the virgin.  No.  No.  That would be wrong.  No, this is something. 
[01:36:30]  It's about Valentine's Day and love.  Sure.  That's very sweet.  Yeah.  So basically, you're just going to set him up.  Right.  Right.  We're going to, you know, if the girl determined this is when she wants to do it, and this is who  she wants to do it with, we will make it the perfect event for you.  So you're, so.  Yeah, if he comes.  They're coming, and you're sort of interviewing them, and then you guys pick who you think should  win this contest.  No, they all go.  We don't care.  Bring on the virgins.  It's going to be a deflowering marathon.  Oh, so you're going to hook up a bunch of people. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, as many as we can get.  Oh, I, oh, okay, cool.  You're going to ask them all, like, how it was and stuff?  Yeah, we'll talk about how it was, how they feel physically, psychologically about the  whole thing.  She was thinking of doing it on the Ikea furniture.  Usually the ladies don't really like it the first time, for the most part.  That's what I've.  Who cares?  Okay?  Let me tell you.  It's like, oh, get out.  No, I'm kidding.  It's not always like that.  So she's ready to go today, but the boyfriend is saying. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, the boyfriend isn't around.  Right.  Boy, that's odd.  A 19-year-old virgin girlfriend.  I'm crazy, because I want to bring him here.  Well, you're just brought here to kind of chat, and then you go off and do what you  do.  That's all.  Wait, they can do it today, though?  They could have.  She's ready.  Yeah, but now, you know, we're looking at an hour left on the show.  I'll do it with you.  I promise it won't hurt.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, of course it won't.  Patricia's shaking his head again.  Wasn't that funny, Voss?  Wasn't that funny?  Colin's right in on it. 
[01:38:00]  Right in on the Voss bashing, Colin.  Welcome to the family.  Sorry, man.  That's okay.  You set me up there.  I'm sorry.  I never did a Cisco movie.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you didn't get the part.  Have you done a movie?  No.  No.  Wow.  Classic.  Classic bastard.  Man.  It's okay.  You're doing fine in your career.  I'm doing very fine.  Ask, is her father alive?  Oh, no.  Huh? 
[01:38:30]  Well, yeah.  Is her father still alive?  Yeah, Colin, you want to ask her about any deaths in the family?  Is your dad still alive?  Yeah.  Sweet.  Does he listen to the show?  Problem solved.  Sometimes.  Actually, he does, but he listens to it in Florida.  I hope that you guys don't have the show in Florida.  Not yet.  Okay, good.  Working on it.  Someone's good.  He's not listening to it.  Yeah, that's good.  He doesn't know his name.  Oh, could this be your boyfriend?  Yeah.  Usually, we don't like calls happening here, but take that call, please, right now.  Beeper.  No, it wasn't him.  Who is it?  9-1-1, 9-1-1.  One of your friends.  Do you know you're on the radio? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, great.  It sounds like your boyfriend's a little nervous about it.  He's a little scared about the event, so to speak.  I don't know.  I know he's not a virgin, but I don't know.  Does he have a cell phone?  Yeah, can we get him on the line?  Do you know his number?  Yeah.  Give Rick the cell phone number.  Rick is going to call him, and we got to work this out.  We just want to see what he's all about.  I would be pretty freaked if I was your boyfriend.  Yeah.  To be quite honest, dude, I would be pretty freaked out as well.  You know what, though, Colin?  It's a chance to deflower your girlfriend. 
[01:39:30]  He's been trying for two years.  I don't even care what the circumstance is.  If she says go, oof, go.  Have you ever deflowered someone?  Yeah, don't even lie.  What?  You know you have.  I never have.  You haven't, Jack?  No.  I've never been anyone's first.  No?  No.  Are you lying?  No, I'm not.  I don't think I have.  No?  You stand out in their memory.  There you go.  Now it's too late.  Now it's like, what?  I'm too old to be with you.  Yeah, right? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, there is a window of opportunity there that kind of closes down as the years go on.  You don't want to be the first at like 35 or something.  You're like, hey, what are you?  I'll pick you up from school and...  She let him kiss it.  She let him kiss it?  She let him kiss it and finger popper.  Well, you can't say that.  All right, Patrice.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong with the word finger?  What's wrong with the word popper?  Exactly.  No, that's okay.  That's all right, dude.  Don't worry about it.  We got systems in place.  You're new.  You'll figure it all out.  It's fun to watch. 
[01:40:30]  It's just when you put those words together.  You put those new guys make these mistakes.  Exactly.  It's all in the context, Jack.  Get your boyfriend's number?  He's calling right now.  He's calling?  Is that him?  He's on 12.  Okay.  Nice.  What's his name?  Thank God.  Jason.  Jason.  Hello?  What's up, man?  Who is this?  It's Opie and Anthony along with your girlfriend.  Nicole.  Yeah.  Why don't you go here?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Hey, dude.  I'm going to do this over here.  Dude.  What?  Who?  Opie?  Anthony?  Yeah, what's up? 
[01:41:00]  You got my girlfriend in the studio?  Yeah, listen up, man.  Yeah.  She wants to lose her virginity to you.  Yeah.  And we want to hook you guys up.  Okay.  I think I can do that on my own.  No, you can't.  Dude, you invested two years.  You couldn't close the deal.  We're doing it for you here in minutes.  In minutes?  Minutes.  Wait, this is not cool.  This is not cool.  Dude, we'll get you a hotel room.  Yeah, we're not saying you're going to do it in front of everyone.  No, you're not doing it in front of anybody.  You're going to be alone.  It's not enough to go there.  Why? 
[01:41:30]  Nicole, is Doug with you?  Ah, pull set.  Yeah, Dougie, her friend.  Get the...  Wait a minute.  Hey, Jason, you must be happy about Dougie.  Dougie's around with her all the time.  Is Dougie gay?  Hey, Dougie, come in here.  Get Dougie in here.  What the hell?  This is a friend of hers.  A good friend.  Dougie.  Yeah, I know him.  Dougie looks good, too.  Look at Dougie.  Dougie.  Dougie looks muscular, yeah.  Like Billy Zane.  Hey, Jay's moving his hips back and forth.  Dougie's moving his hips around.  Yeah, Doug.  Hey, Jason.  Get away from her, Doug.  Get away from her. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, she wanted to come out here, so I brought her, you know, right?  You want to come out here?  You know what I'm saying?  Doug is pulsating.  Hey, Jason, how you feel about her being friends with Dougie?  I'm pretty sick of it.  I'm pretty sick of it.  Why are you sick of it?  Right now, it's pretty much the end of the story right now.  Why don't you come down here to the studio, man?  You got 50 minutes.  You can do it.  Come down here.  Dougie, I want to talk to you, first of all.  Nicole, why did you go with him out there to the city in the first place?  He's my best friend.  I told you not to go. 
[01:42:30]  I told you not to go out there.  He's my best friend.  What's the big deal anyway?  Did he tell you the deal?  Yeah, for two years, you know that I want you.  I told you yesterday.  You knew the whole thing.  I don't know why you're trying to back out now.  Why can't we just do this, just me and you in private?  Why do we got to do this over the whole...  It's not like they're going to watch you or anything.  Doug's going to smash it.  I mean, I should be more scared than you.  Doug's going to smash it.  I'm feeling Doug.  Hear this sound?  Look at Doug, all smooth over there.  That's her booty.  Look, look, look.  Oh. 
[01:43:00]  That's what Patrice said.  He goes, it looks like Billy Zane or something.  Colin, yeah.  Oh, Colin said that?  Yeah.  Nicole, Nicole.  What?  Nicole.  Talk to him, Nicole.  Come over here.  Baby.  You're finished.  Why did you go out there?  Because I don't want to move it into your arm.  Didn't we talk about this?  Exactly.  First, you were with it, and now you're, like, backing out.  Because I love you, baby.  I love you, too.  So why don't you go over here?  I don't want to do this.  I want to do it just me and you. 
[01:43:30]  Why can't you just do it over here?  It's going to be me and you anyway.  I mean...  Hey, dude, you weren't going to close the deal without us anyway.  I'm going to close this deal.  Hey, was he going to close the deal unless we had brought this up?  Probably not.  Probably not.  Dude, you owe us.  Get your ass down here and F-R.  She's a cute young thing.  Jay, Jay, Jay.  What better way to do it than with ONA participating?  You know what I mean?  Well, yeah.  That's coming from Dougie.  Hey, come on down here.  Come on down here.  Come on.  Brooklyn Diner.  Dougie. 
[01:44:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  You guys got me off guard, man.  It's a free hotel room.  Hey, bro.  Hey, Jason.  Come over here, baby.  You weren't going to do it in front of everyone.  I mean, if you guys wanted a hotel, we were going to hook that up, whatever.  We'll hook you up, whatever you want, man.  What do you think?  Nicole.  What do you think?  Nicole, we've been going out for two years.  There's no reason for this.  There's no reason for this.  There's no reason for what? 
[01:44:30]  I want to lose my virginity to you.  Don't you want to be special?  Just me and you with some candles or something like that.  It is going to be special.  That's why I want to share it with you.  Nicole's going to do it, man.  That's it.  Opie, Anthony, you guys suck.  Nicole, you embarrass me, man.  Oh, man.  Come on.  I'm embarrassed, boy.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Nicole sucks, too.  Jason.  All right.  Bye.  Hey, Dougie, that sounded like they're broken up to me.  Hey, I'm her best friend, and if she needs a shoulder to cry on, I'm just going to 
[01:45:00]  Oh, yeah, Dougie.  Yeah, he pulls her clothes.  What are you waiting for?  You guys suck, man.  I'll give her the kiss on the forehead.  Guys are pigs.  That's it.  There you go.  Well, try to go smooth things over, Nicole, and maybe we can make this happen next week.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll try.  I think we can turn this guy around, Anthony.  Yeah, he seems...  But he'll get over it.  You know what it is?  He wants it to be special.  We could do that for you guys.  He doesn't understand the concept.  He doesn't feel special, not him.  He doesn't understand the concept.  He thinks it's us, you know, going to be in the room, and it's going to be a microphone  on it.  No.  We'll get the hotel, we'll get the candles, we'll get the music, we'll get Tenacious D 
[01:45:30]  to play in the corner.  Yeah, that's good AF music.  Just keep Voss's tapes away, man.  Gets your AF...  Yeah.  Stay away with them tapes.  Everyone loves Voss.  I got drivers coming at me now.  How old's your boyfriend?  20.  20, oh.  All right.  I think the boyfriend's feeling too much pressure.  Do you think that's what it is?  I think that's what's going on.  He wants to.  God forbid he can't perform.  Yeah, but now that it's been such a big deal, now he's freaking out. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  That's what I think is what's going on.  And apparently, he's not very happy with it right now.  Yeah, that's what I'm feeling.  You know?  My final thoughts after this.  That's what it sounded like, a friggin' Springer episode with you two.  Nicole, give us an update on Monday, all right?  I hope you smooth things over.  He doesn't have a premature problem or anything.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I mean, is it one of those things?  Oh, that's it.  No, he doesn't.  Salt in the wound there, Keith.  I'm just asking.  No, he doesn't.  Okay.  He does all right, right?  Yeah, he's pretty cool.  All right.  There you go.  We should break. 
[01:46:30]  We got to get these guys out of here, the big movie stars.  Guys, we're big movie stars.  Jack Black and Colin Hanks.  That's right.  Of course you guys are.  Orange County, man.  Go check it out.  Thanks for having us.  Best of luck.  I know Jack Black will be back.  SD plays in a couple weeks.  Absolutely.  All right.  And Colin, will you come back and see us?  With a broken microphone now?  If you fix the mic, dude.  Yeah, dude, I'll come back.  Yeah, stop back when you're in town, man.  I will.  Most definitely, dude.  You're all right, man.  I like it.  This was fun, man.  It's cash.  It's just hanging.  It's kind of crazy, but I dig it.  Good luck with the Virgin Contest.  Thank you. 
[01:47:00]  I don't know, man.  You may not get one.  I know.  Are we kidding?  This was our third attempt, and so far we're 0 for 3.  You know, we're trying here.  We got some time.  It's a really happy show you guys got here.  Hey, at least we're not bringing up death tattoos, Colin.  Dude, it was not a death tattoo.  You've earned that segment.  It said Tad.  I thought maybe she was a fan of the group, you know?  Come out of an up-tempo number into a goddamn death tattoo.  Dude, I just wanted to know what the tattoo was for.  I didn't know it was a death tattoo.  I know.  Innocent mistake.  It was a death tattoo. 
[01:47:30]  You guys suck.  Obi and Anthony. </pre>
