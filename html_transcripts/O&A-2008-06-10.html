<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts celebrating their top ranking among male listeners, contrasting it with their significantly lower female listenership.  Opie recounted a visit to an acupuncturist before the conversation pivoted to their recent $347,000 FCC fine for using a childish word, sparking a debate on the absurdity and inconsistency of FCC regulations regarding acceptable language.  They playfully explored the boundaries of acceptable words like "duty" and "poop."  Opie then shared a hilarious anecdote about consuming low-calorie organic potato chips, leading to severe stomach cramps and a near-bathroom accident in a supermarket queue, prompting a discussion about the laxative effects of Olestra and a potential "Olestra Day" segment.

Listener feedback followed, including comments about Opie's girlfriend's breasts being on TV and a request for Anthony to write a Lou Gehrig-esque speech. The hosts then vented their frustration with XM's lawyers over delays in posting their animation festival content online. This transitioned into a discussion of a New York City spin class incident involving "aggressive nakedness," a physical altercation, and ensuing lawsuits. A brief interview with K-Rock intern Josh ensued, followed by more jokes at his expense.  The conversation then turned to a study on the high prevalence of herpes in New York City, with Opie revealing he has oral herpes and speculating on how he contracted it.

The show moved on to a discussion of Roger Clemens and alleged Viagra use, generating humorous speculation about its performance-enhancing effects on the baseball field and its awkward locker room implications, including a mention of a related photoshopped image.  Ken Griffey Jr.'s 600th home run received a brief mention before a comedic segment on racial stereotypes in baseball and basketball.  The conversation then returned to Oscar De La Hoya and the controversy surrounding purportedly photoshopped pictures of him in drag, with extended discussion of the photo authenticity and the reasons behind the retraction of his lawsuit.  The hosts speculated on De La Hoya's reluctance to do radio interviews. Finally, a segment about Roland's excessive sweating, complete with visual descriptions and humorous anecdotes about his aversion to winter clothes, was shown, concluding with promotion of an upcoming "Weird Medicine" segment.

A significant portion of the show focused on Anthony's new relationship with Jill Nicolini.  The hosts discussed their relationship with humorous anecdotes about their courtship and various social events attended together, including a Clark Gillies Foundation event with former New York Islanders players.  Anthony's dislike for children was contrasted with his concern for children with cancer.  Photos of Anthony and Jill from onaradio.com were described in detail, including pictures of them in Nashville wearing cowboy attire.  The conversation shifted to rising gas prices and the global economic impact of oil, culminating in a pessimistic prediction about the future of the U.S. This led to a discussion about a purported water-powered car and speculation about the inventor's potential fate at the hands of the government.  Roland's "Tragic News" segment, punctuated by being repeatedly tickled, followed, along with a phone call from Ricky Gervais.  Gervais discussed his new movie, "Ghost Town," his views on global warming, his experiences with the British press, and the differences in comedic sensibilities between the US and UK.  Opie and Anthony shared their frustrations with their employer's restrictions on humor.

A subsequent phone interview with Ricky Gervais was followed by a call with Mark Wahlberg. Gervais discussed his work on *The Office* (UK), *Extras*, and *Grand Theft Auto IV*, his preference for creative control, and a previous awkward interview with Opie and Anthony.  The hosts then mistakenly greeted Mark Wahlberg as Gervais due to a mix-up in their notes.  They discussed Wahlberg's career, his lack of texting skills, his almost-role in *Brokeback Mountain*, and his experiences working with M. Night Shyamalan. Wahlberg shared anecdotes about his past legal troubles and his transformation into a successful actor, including comments on working with difficult directors and the occasional dishonesty in film promotion.

The show's final portion focused on the hosts' anger towards their D.C. team regarding technical and legal issues with their animation festival.  Several animations were rejected for copyright infringement, leading to expletive-laden complaints about the slow response and poor communication from their legal and technical teams concerning delays in the animations' availability on iTunes.

A segment dedicated to the 2008 Presidential election followed, featuring racially charged comments about Obama and McCain and their spouses, speculation about potential threats against Obama, and the discussion of internet videos, including one of a news reporter with a bug in his mouth and the disturbing movie "Bad Boy Bubby."  The conversation also included a list of movies that make men cry, prompting more racially charged and sexually explicit comments.  Discussions of UFCâ€™s potential sale and other unrelated topics were included.

The show concluded with Anthony detailing his childhood experiences, including physical discipline from his father and witnessing family violence, resulting in his fear of violence and the carrying of a gun.  He discussed his emotional responses, his past tendency to cry easily, and the connection between his avoidance of crying and the discovery of sex.  He shared anecdotes about dangerous car rides with his father and detailed a disturbing experience involving an excessive childhood spanking.  The conversation shifted to movies that make men cry, with a clip of Tippi Tom reacting to *Sophie's Choice* being played.  A significant portion focused on a humorous, sexually suggestive recounting of Sam Roberts' childhood encounter with wrestling promoter Salvatore Sincere, involving alleged inappropriate touching and sexual acts. Discussions about Sam's hair, various unrelated topics, and advertisements, including CardScan, were featured, concluding with Anthony mentioning his upcoming therapy session.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Great controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Jots, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  We were number one across the board with men in Morning Drive Radio here in New York City.  Yeah, we're doing better.  In men, we were number one.  And in women, we crept up to number 375.  So I went to the axiopuncturist, and this fine Chinese doctor popped about 20 needles 
[00:01:00]  at me.  Would you take a needle?  What do you need curing, besides your alcoholism?  What's up, Anthony?  Is the date officially over?  Uh, no.  Do you need help?  I'm just doing help.  No, you.  Yes, I'm a hostage of love.  Oh, God.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We are grown men, right? 
[00:01:30]  I think so.  It's supposed to be.  This radio thing makes you sound immature.  We don't bitch as much, trust me.  The old days, we bitched on a regular basis, but we're all grown men.  We're all, well, two out of three are in their 40s.  We got some 40 flurfs in the studio, and then one that's going to be 40 in the  very near future, whenever the hell his birthday is.  Who knows at this point?  Today. 
[00:02:00]  Today is your 40th birthday, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Woo-hoo.  And, uh, safe to say we're grown men, and we just had enough, we're discussing whether  we can say a word on the radio that kids use in kindergarten.  Every day.  Kindergarten.  Yeah.  You and Mike can't believe it.  Our new producer here cannot believe what we've been dealing with CBS later.  It, it has nothing to do with, uh, the FCC. 
[00:02:30]  What, they would never fine a show for saying what they said we can't say.  That's just the way it is.  They would be embarrassed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, a ruling came down from the FCC.  The Opie and Anthony Show were fined $347,000 for a word kindergartensers say.  Well, it's the context.  Like, uh, the word is this.  It's duty.  Are we trying to say that?  Yes.  You can say it, you just can't put it in any context. 
[00:03:00]  But that's the word.  But even that's edgy.  The one we wanted to use is even, like, safer than that.  Yeah.  Cuter than that.  Oh, oh, oh.  Is this poop?  Yeah.  Can you say that?  Like that?  I think you can say it.  You just can't put it in any context.  You can't say anything about what it's doing, where it is, what happened to it, where it  came from, nothing.  Can you say it's the equivalent of a lawyer?  Right.  You know, I'm not a corporate lawyer, thank God. 
[00:03:30]  And if I was, I would be jumping out of an airplane without a, without a parachute.  Yeah.  Because why would you want to live if you were a corporate lawyer?  Fling yourself out.  What?  Uh.  I don't know.  It's, uh.  I just lost my thought because I just had such hatred for a lawyer.  I know.  I was going somewhere and then I started thinking how much I hate lawyers and I lost my thought. 
[00:04:00]  It, like, zaps the slice plane.  I swear to God.  Yeah.  I had a really good little, little thing on, on the word.  You just got the men in black funk in your face.  I don't even know what I was going to say next because I, I thought corporate lawyer again  and just thought how miserable they've made our lives over the years.  And I, my memory was just, zzzz.  They really have to, um, think about what they're saying we can't say. 
[00:04:30]  They really have to think it over and, and really picture whether the FCC would, would  bring a fine down if somebody complained about it.  Right.  I mean, be serious.  I've seen the transcripts of shows that have been fined and they are blatant, blatant abuses.  Yeah.  Where you read it and go, oh, come on.  Of course we, we're not going to do that.  But, uh, something like, you know, talking about duty. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Is so innocent and silly that, uh, you couldn't possibly get a fine from it.  Right.  Well, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Make believe you didn't hear any of that talk because I want to go into a story that  connects everything.  Oh, okay.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Um, so I, uh, I, I go to the gym yesterday.  I do a little lifting and then I meet my girl cause she's doing some errands in the neighborhood  and I go, Hey, you want to go get a smoothie?  Cause I like to get a protein smoothie after I work out. 
[00:05:30]  This is sounding bad.  Supposedly it helps your muscle growth.  Does it?  Who knows?  Who knows what helps what at this point?  Um, and, uh, we're waiting online and we're getting our smoothies and I see to the side,  it's kind of like a health food store and I see a bag of potato chips, Jimmy, you like  potato chips, don't you?  And they say, they say organic potato chips and right on the packaging, it says only 100 
[00:06:00]  calories.  Well, how great is that?  Potato chips, a hundred calories.  That sounds like you could just scarf them up without feeling guilty.  Right guys.  And, um, I knew there had to be a downside to a package of potato chips that, uh, only  have a hundred calories in it.  So I gobbled them up.  I enjoyed my, my organic potato chips, although they could have used a little grease and a 
[00:06:30]  little salt.  Ah, just a little.  I was telling my girl, I'm like, these would be good if they had just a little more grease  and a little more salt.  But you gobbled them up.  Oh boy, did I gobble them up, Anthony?  Actually, they were very dry.  There wasn't a hint of grease on these potato chips and not much salt either.  Um, and I just crumple up the bag and I throw it away and then we head toward the, the,  the supermarket cause I'm going to like try to cook some dinner last night and halfway 
[00:07:00]  to the supermarket.  Oh, you started percolating.  I felt my, uh, my insides just dropping like a door at a haunted house and it's dropping.  And then you ever get it so bad that obviously I don't have to tell you about the pain and 
[00:07:30]  the pain gets lower and lower, but you ever get it so bad that you start shivering even  though it's a hundred degrees out, that's some pain.  So then we're online at the supermarket cause I'm like trying to judge.  I'm like, I think I can do this.  So, you know, our fine supermarket there, Jimmy, I'm online.  The line's taken forever, forever.  And all of a sudden, uh, my girl hears a noise and, and swears it was me, you know, you know,  another word we're not allowed to say, but you know, a little, I go, that wasn't me. 
[00:08:00]  And then she starts laughing.  She goes, you're going to blank your pants.  And I'm like, no, I'm not.  And as we get closer and closer to the, the register, now I'm, I'm in full clenching of  the cheeks, full clench.  And my stomach continues.  So then I waddle, no joke, waddle.  I mean, I know that's a joke, but I'm truly just waddling. 
[00:08:30]  Cause any like separation of the legs could be the end of what disaster, what I'm going  to throw it, it's up to the final gate.  It's like, it has reached, it has reached the castle door.  Oh yeah.  There's been the, everything has dropped down.  Right.  My, my body temperature is now freezing.  The last, the last safety valve is in place.  Yeah.  And then I get on the elevator to go back upstairs and full elevator, which I rarely get. 
[00:09:00]  And then I'm, I'm halfway to my apartment and, and the kid is confused cause he's not  sure what it's his floor and he's in the elevator where mommy.  So I almost kicked him out, out of the elevator and then, and then as we're heading toward  my floor, my girl is just openly laughing at me cause now it's so obvious that it's going  to happen.  And you're having a huge problem.  Are you stiff leg walking where you can't bend the legs?  You got a stiff leg, stiff leg, the waddle, the clinching, all that. 
[00:09:30]  Drop all the groceries, run down the hall, go into the apartment.  And then, and then Hiroshima and, and then a pot roast was born with my, my girl mocking  and laughing at me through the door.  I'm like, all right, I get it.  And then she kept, she wouldn't stop. 
[00:10:00]  Through the door?  She wouldn't stop because she thought she heard this noise in the supermarket and I  swear it wasn't.  Uh huh.  And, uh, and she's like, she just kept saying, you almost blanked your pants.  You almost blanked.  She's mocking me as I'm, as the pain and, and everything is, is, is happening in the bathroom.  That's rough.  And then, and then I decided to gorge myself on spaghetti last night because I can't help  myself.  Why?  I love spaghetti.  It's the only time I overeat is with spaghetti. 
[00:10:30]  And, uh, I went to bed early and then I'm woken up in the middle of the night cause my,  my girl's laughing.  I turn over like all confused and like, you know, sleepy eyes and like, what?  She goes, I can't say the word.  Can I?  I go, you're farting in your sleep.  Like you want to wake me up to tell me this?  She informed you of that?  I'm like, leave me alone.  It was those dumb potato chips, those organic potato spuds.  What's in them?  Is it Olien or no?  I think it was the, uh, it might've been the Elastra. 
[00:11:00]  I think we should have Elastra day on the Opie and Anthony show.  I think not.  That hurts your stomach.  That's what I'm saying.  Immediately.  Immediately.  It's not, it's not worth the benefits.  No.  But we should have a Elastra day.  Would you do a Elastra day on the show, Jimmy?  See who could hold out the most?  Yeah.  Who do I care?  Or the longest, whatever.  Would you be part of a Elastra day?  I don't, uh, I don't, uh, participate in, in those activities.  Some of these, some of these products that have the Elastra, uh, Iraq said, and he is,  he is right because I saw it myself. 
[00:11:30]  Uh, they warn you about leakage.  Yes, yes.  If you eat their product.  You can't have a leakage.  How could, how could that be legal?  They have to warn you about leakage.  They say avoid trampolines and white pants.  Uh, so there you go.  That's my cute little story to start this fine day off.  Well, that was actually, uh, is that the, what is Olean?  Is that the name of a brand?  That's the brand.  Oh, okay.  So the Elastra, for a while that I had eaten that before. 
[00:12:00]  This one.  I didn't know how bad they hurt you.  It's really even stomach cramps.  You know, I threw the packaging away and, and then all this started.  I'm like, ah, why didn't I keep the package so I could bring it in and I'll, I'll get another  one today and bring it in tomorrow so you can look at it and taste these, what they call  potato chips.  All right.  How's everybody else this morning?  Good.  Anything, anything going on that I need to know about?  Nah. 
[00:12:30]  Nah.  There was a, uh, there was a fine instant feedback about your girlfriend.  Really?  And you gotta just, you gotta just, uh, you gotta tap out or, or throw in a towel when you're,  you're done with all this.  But some guy said, wow, I just saw Jill's boobs on TV.  Mm-hmm.  Careful.  Yeah.  And then he gives you a compliment.  He goes, when is Anthony going to write his Lou Gehrig speech?  I would love to give the guy credit, but I went off, went dabbling about my dumb story 
[00:13:00]  that the instant feedback is, uh, long gone.  Your instant feedback is long gone.  So inside note, she had to change her shirt cause, uh, someone spilled coffee on her.  This morning?  One of the girls spilled coffee on it.  Yeah.  There you go.  A little inside story.  She's doing costume changes as she does the traffic here in New York?  Well, when coffee spills on it, you have to.  Huh.  Can't go out on television with coffee spilled on you.  Right.  Oh, by the way, there was a lot of back and forth with the lawyers down in, uh, Washington 
[00:13:30]  that work for XM.  About?  We got lawyers effing with our show here.  We got lawyers effing with our show on satellite.  Everyone knows we did the animation festival.  Uh-huh.  It was a huge, uh, hit.  Uh, the animations were great and we were very excited to, uh, you know, put them somewhere  where everyone could go and see them.  And, and we're still waiting for that to happen.  Why?  Because, uh, the latest is they have to, uh, approve of the animations, which is kind 
[00:14:00]  of a normal thing, but we're up to Tuesday.  The animation festival was last Thursday and we still don't have them up on iTunes where  we wanted everyone to go to check out the animations.  What has to be approved?  Just the content and this and that.  Content.  How long does it take them?  It's a basic thing, but these, these stupid lawyers, it's not important to them.  So they, they take their time.  Would you just knock it off already?  This was incredibly important, uh, to the Opie and Anthony show.  And what do they do? 
[00:14:30]  Five days later, they're still not up on iTunes.  Five days later.  So you could go to, uh, animationfest.net.  By the way, Steve said there was a lot of bandwidth on that site, but so many people were  trying to, you know, check out the animations that had really, you know, clogged up the pipeline  there on animationfest.net.  And also all the, uh, animations are up on, um, you two.  What I've been doing is just typing in Opie and Anthony animations.  You get all of the animations over the last few years, but you'll figure out the ones that  were from, uh, the festival this past Thursday. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  But you know, a big F you to the lawyers down in Washington.  You're, you're not helping us out.  This, this morning radio thing is hard enough.  And then you got people behind the scenes, you know, not doing their jobs.  And then, then they're trying to explain why, why, you know, why it's not done yet.  And it's all BS excuses.  It's lazy lawyers that, you know, it wasn't a priority to them.  So we get effed in the end.  It's certainly not working on the merger.  And then, yeah, no kidding.  And then they went after young Sam saying, well, they sent them in the wrong format. 
[00:15:30]  I'm like, shut up.  We were looking at these things weeks ago.  Yeah.  A lot of them.  Exactly.  Sam is worthless, but this is not one that he screwed up.  Of course he is.  I had to stick up for young Sam and the gang yesterday because they're trying to hint  that it was our problem.  I'm like, it's not our problem.  Yeah.  The animation, we, we got the final animations on Wednesday.  So they, they could have easily started looking at these things and had them up on iTunes by  yesterday easily, but they didn't, like I said, it wasn't a priority and that's how it 
[00:16:00]  works for people that don't have the passion for, for their jobs.  Bastards.  877-212-O-N-A.  So there you go.  You go to animationfest.net or on YouTube.  There's a thing in the paper today about aggressive nakedness in the gyms.  Dude, I was just reading that laughing my ass off.  Aggressive nakedness.  Laughing my ass off.  What constitutes aggressive nakedness?  Well, just to, just to set up, you know, the, uh, the, what, what, the, the, the bike, this 
[00:16:30]  spin class.  Oh yes.  Spinning.  The guy that was in spin class who was grunting.  And then another guy said, you know, F you and you're dumb grunting.  So he picked up the dude and his bike and threw him up against the wall.  It was a huge, huge case here in New York city.  Love that story.  And, uh, there were no charges filed, right?  Against, oh, here comes stunt brain.  Oh boy.  No, they went to court and the guy was found innocent.  And now there's a civil suit being filed against the gym and the, uh, bike tosser.  The guy was found out to be a liar by the jury.  They said his name was Sugarman, I think. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  He was a, a, a, a, a liar and they didn't believe him.  Yeah.  Now the grunter is, uh, suing the gym because he's trying to get something out of this.  So.  Hold on.  Hey Norton.  Oh.  You're Norton.  I know.  Oh, but he looks like you.  Yeah, he does.  Does he?  Yes.  He looks like me if I were a cartoon character.  No offense.  He looks like, uh, no, no, no.  He's a big cab to me.  What, what, what, what cartoon with the, uh, with the, uh, with the vulture? 
[00:17:30]  Was it the vulture or the, I was thinking more of the tortoise.  Yeah, the tortoise had the same voice.  All right.  And he looks kind of like that.  All right.  Let's, let's just be honest.  He looks like a retarded Jim Norton.  Yes.  You want to say cartoon character and stuff.  I'm just saying a retarded Jim Norton.  That's what I would look like.  Completely retarded.  In shorts with big, can he come back in here?  If you were, yeah.  If Jimmy was retarded.  Yeah.  Where is he?  Why would he know?  He's retarded.  He's walking into CBS FM right now.  Here I am.  They're like, no.  No. 
[00:18:00]  Why, why would anyone send him?  Oh, God.  He's probably eating paint.  I love, we have probably 30 people that work for this show, but they don't even realize  that we're on the air right now.  No.  They just lost him.  Like we needed that guy and he's long gone.  Yeah.  Where is he?  Like, does anyone pay attention to what's going on around them?  I don't think so.  We were talking about the guy.  I don't think they do.  You, sir.  Ah, there he is.  Let's learn what his name is.  Take your time going to the mic.  We're only talking to a million people. 
[00:18:30]  Are you doing what's his name there?  Josh.  Yes, sir.  Hi, Josh.  I can remember that.  That's an easy name to remember.  So what are you doing?  Interning, I was going to get some breakfast for some people.  All righty.  We interned for K-Rock.  K-Rock, yes.  Ah.  K-Rock intern.  And what do you do?  Go to school?  I go to school in Boston, yes.  Radio?  No.  I edit a journalism minor, though.  Oh, okay.  So I'd like to do that someday. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  What's your major?  Sociology.  So what are you doing in radio?  I chose sociology just because I wasn't real sure what I wanted to do, and I kind of liked  the classes.  All right.  Actually, they were my favorite classes in college.  Were they?  Yeah.  They were the cool ones.  Yeah.  You learned about real stuff.  Yeah.  We were hoping you were dumb, though.  Yeah, I know.  I was a minor with social, what's this?  Sociology?  Yeah, socialism.  Socialism?  The liberals teaching a class.  All right.  I screwed up here. 
[00:19:30]  They are the best classes in college.  I like them, yeah.  Like Planet Earth.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I took a class called Planet Earth.  What do you need to learn?  No, no.  Spaceship Earth.  Just stand on it.  Spaceship Earth.  That's right.  That's the thing at Epcot Center.  It's been way too long, but Spaceship Earth.  Yeah, we were hoping, because we were saying you kind of look like a retarded Jim Norton,  but you're kind of a smart guy, and that sucks.  All right.  We were hoping you'd be like, duh.  And we're going to be smart and get out of this. 
[00:20:00]  What?  Tailspin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry, man.  Sorry, Josh.  No offense.  Very good, Josh.  There goes Josh.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Everybody in New York City that has herpes.  Talking to a lot of people, apparently.  Good morning to the herpes sufferers.  That's how we're going to grow with this radio show.  That's a demo that's untapped.  We want the herpes demo. 
[00:20:30]  Study came out today or yesterday.  One in four adults in New York City have the herpes.  Which herpes, though?  There's a few different ones.  There's one and there's two.  One is mouth.  Two is genitals.  They're saying two.  One, I think 80% of the people have.  Look at you.  That's my guess.  I got the mouth one.  Do you?  Well, it's cold sores and stuff, right?  I've had them since I was a kid, so I'm wondering.  Can't that turn into two if you...  I don't know.  Like, let's say you did something to somebody when you had a sore on your lip. 
[00:21:00]  Couldn't that then end up there where you were doing something?  I think it still stays one.  Yeah?  I think so, or everybody would have that.  I mean...  Yeah, really.  So many people have one...  Well...  That if you could do that with one and make it a two...  Yeah.  You think this is calculus?  I've been getting the...  One to one.  I've been getting the cold sore since I was a very little tot.  So I'm trying to figure out which creepy aunt gave me a kiss while she had one. 
[00:21:30]  Oh.  How horrible is that?  It wasn't even a kiss.  It was one of these...  Well, how else did I get it when I was, like, young?  Or...  How?  Yeah, where did it come from?  Where did it come from?  I had to get it from some slob that had a big sore kiss in your little baby face.  My earliest recollection was getting these dumb things.  I think I was, yeah, six, seven years old when I started realizing, what the hell is this?  Why do I have to deal with this? 
[00:22:00]  So some aunt, I guess, kissed me?  How does that work?  Yeah, probably.  Yeah?  Well, all I know now is, like...  Some uncle.  If there's even a hint of redness on my lip...  Yeah.  My girl puts up the plastic all over the house.  What?  It makes me live in a bubble.  Oh, really?  Until it goes away.  Why don't you just take a Valtrex?  No kissing for the opster.  Wow.  She's paranoid.  Dude, take a Valtrex.  Or she'll kiss me on this side.  You don't get the Valtrex?  Yeah, take one, I think, or whatever.  You'll be fine. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we want to say hi to everybody else that has herpes out there.  Good evening.  Good.  Good evening.  Well, embarrassing getting a prescription, but...  No?  It's not embarrassing if one in four adults have it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I would think, you know, you'd want to go to the drugstore and pick up your Valtrex.  They would look at you funny.  There's creepier stuff to get at the drugstore than a prescription for Valtrex.  Especially if you're getting it with a prescription for Cialis and Chloroform. 
[00:23:00]  And rubber gloves.  Duct tape.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Valtrex, Chloroform, Cialis, duct tape.  Valtrex.  And a hat.  A Rite Aid hat.  Scott from HopHog makes me feel good.  Herpes 1 is nothing.  All right.  Nothing.  No, it's herpes 1.  Ah, it's nothing, though.  A little stress and they pop out.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  But herpes 2?  Herpes 2, that's an issue.  Now, is that what they're talking about?  1 in 4 New Yorkers has genital herpes.  No, they just said herpes, so I guess that's 1 and 2 combined.  Hey, uh.  That's silly.  Did you guys hear about the Viagra?  This poor Roger Clemens is having a tough year and a half, huh?  Now he's on the cover of the paper.  Because now there's a claim that he took Viagra.  Goodness gracious!  Viva Viagra!  Hold on, it was the virus that caused his genital herpes. 
[00:24:00]  Ah, so it is.  1 in 4 New Yorkers have genital herpes?  Wow.  Or they have the virus that transmits.  The high incidence of sexually transmitted herpes is Simplex 2, which has no cures.  Why are we saying how you're more likely to get AIDS?  Because I guess the sores, but people are probably having a high risk.  So who's got it in here?  See, let's look around the room.  Look, man.  There's 5 of us in here.  Look, I admit it to 1.  Someone has to admit to the 2.  You got 1?  I got the 1. 
[00:24:30]  I'm clean.  You rock, you got 3?  That's when you have 2 in your mouth.  All right, well, if anyone wants to admit that, that's wonderful.  Front page of the Daily News.  Viva Viagra!  You'll never guess why Roger Clemens and other pro athletes took the little blue pill.  Now poor Roger Clemens.  I guess he wasn't Superman after all, huh?  No.  You're just thinking Viagra, supposedly steroids, banging young country singers, supposedly. 
[00:25:00]  They are saying that the Viagra helps out on the field.  How does Viagra help on the field?  I imagine it's with hitting.  Got your own baseball bat, do you?  Got a little pine tar on it.  Swing away.  Where you get the first, like, you know, an inch faster.  Yeah, well, first of all, it's supposed to get these steroids, if you're on steroids, into 
[00:25:30]  your system quicker.  Mm-hmm.  Deliver it faster, because I guess, you know, your blood pressure goes up.  Your circulation opens up with Viagra.  And it's supposed to give you some kind of, like, more energy and stamina out on the field.  Really?  Yeah.  Does it?  I don't know.  Does it give you more stamina, like, in the bedroom?  I haven't taken one in a long time, but it would always make my, like, we were in Brazil,  we were doing 100 milligrams a night, which is a lot.  And then going out and just having sex with three whores, and you couldn't do it, you couldn't 
[00:26:00]  end.  Wait, wait, what's the basic dose?  25, 50, and 100 milligrams.  And you're doing 100?  Oh, was I?  Wow.  Yeah.  I would actually just put them into my tongue and let them soak it in my system.  The kid didn't play games.  It was like nitroglycerin.  And then I would go to the whorehouses, and it was amazing how you get, like, you get a  headache, you see a little bit of blue, and it gives you, it ruins your sinuses.  I mean, this is back in 2003.  Maybe they've fixed it since then, but it really... 
[00:26:30]  Do you get the beet red face?  Yeah.  Cialis is much better, I think.  Yeah, well.  Well, it's wonderful that it's helping these guys on the field, but it's got to make it  quite awkward in the locker room after the game.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, imagine that one.  Yeah.  Good game.  You're taking off your jock.  Wow, Bernie, you were a four for four.  Yeah, yeah.  Whoa.  It is fat.  It is thick. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I'm going to hit the showers.  Whoa.  Just awkward for everyone.  Why aren't you showering?  I'm late.  I have to go somewhere.  How embarrassing would that be?  It's just sticking out of the top of the cup.  And rumor has it, Susan Wallman might have been in the locker room.  Goodness gracious.  Wow.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen. 
[00:27:30]  Wait, maybe we have audio of where she said George was, too.  I mean, that might...  I don't have that.  I only have the quickie.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Goodness gracious.  She's very impressed.  Yeah.  Pettit's staring.  Oh, Posada's head and his nose is stuffy.  Ah, because he knew.  Wow.  Pettit's laying there.  Posada's doing push-ups over him.  Don Zimmer's face is beet red. 
[00:28:00]  Goodness gracious.  Why is Don taking the Viagra, too?  He's just sitting on the bench with the boys.  They're all seeing blue.  Unbelievable.  Oh, Rivera and Pettit are sword fighting.  Look what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  They're docking.  Jimmy, you wasted all that Viagra.  You could have been like a 300 hitter in the major leagues, but instead you're in Brazil. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  You know?  And his inspiring speech.  Well, uh, they came and got me out of Texas.  You hear, I've been seeing you.  You'll be seeing more of this.  Slaps against George's cheek.  Wow.  They will not leave Roger Clemens alone.  Great to be here.  Whoa.  Now batting.  So now they're taking the Viagra. 
[00:29:00]  Look at that picture.  Can we?  Yes.  Perfect, D-Rock.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  I'll put that picture up on onaradio.com immediately under our discussion on how Major League Baseball  players have been taking the Viagra.  Ow.  You'll have to wait for the picture.  What's the reason for that pose that these two gentlemen are in?  Is that Photoshop?  Oh, of course. 
[00:29:30]  Okay.  Of course.  I don't know.  They Photoshop the smile off Jeter's face.  I thought maybe he was trying to move him out of the way or something.  Of what?  I don't know.  Why would one man be kneeling and another man be kneeling behind him to move him out  of the way?  Yeah.  What, did he think he was sick and he was pushing him to the hospital?  Well, Ann was confused because he's holding his hips, assuming that he's going to just  move him out of the way.  Yeah, he's just going to move him sideways a little bit.  He's going to move him closer and then move him farther.  And then move him closer. 
[00:30:00]  Repeat.  Yeah.  I like to think that they took too much Viagra and they're just trying to hide something.  They're embarrassed.  So they're leaning down.  We're not telling the picture.  Clemens is kind of squatting there.  Yeah.  He's holding on to Jeter's hips.  Jeter looks like he's been injured.  So he's on his hands and knees.  He's on all fours.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's up on onaradio.com.  Very good, Stump Frank.  Thank you.  Before we finish our baseball discussion, this happened last night.  He's back with a 3-1.  Griffey swings. 
[00:30:30]  There it goes.  Long fly ball.  Right field.  It is a number 600 for Ken Griffey Jr.  Wow.  He kind of blew the call.  He's.  It's.  Ken Griffey Jr.  should have been the all-time home run leader, but was injured way too many times.  Do we know how much he's missed?  Because it was seven.  Complete seasons and not one.  I think he's missed.  I think he's missed the equivalent of two seasons. 
[00:31:00]  If he would have hit 40, 50 homers and that would have been in his prime, he would have  been pushing 700 at this point.  Easy.  He was way ahead as far as, you know, getting big numbers in the home run category, and  then he slowed way down because of all the injuries.  I hate Griffey anyway, so I hope he.  Why do you hate him, Jimmy?  Because he would never play for the Yankees because his father didn't have a bad experience  here.  And I just never thought he was.  I thought with him and Randy Johnson and A-Rod and Edgar Martinez and Jay Bune and all  those guys, they never won anything in Seattle.  I just think he's a guy that gets hits when you need him to. 
[00:31:30]  He's great if there's like one out in the seventh and a guy on and you're down 8-2.  Boo.  He's one of those guys.  Yeah, he never struck me as a great clutch player.  He never won anything, right?  No.  In all his years?  Cincinnati.  What's he doing in there?  No offense, Cincinnati, but come on, you're not even a real city.  You're a town with a bunch of eyes in it.  Too many eyes.  Yeah, you're like Mississippi, but without the Mississippi part.  Six player to hit 600 home runs. 
[00:32:00]  Name them.  Ken Griffey Jr.  Babe Ruth.  Sammy Sosa.  Is he one of them?  Yes.  You read the story.  I did not.  Bonds, Hank Aaron.  No one had to be Sammy Sosa.  And hold on.  We got Mickey Mantle.  I believe he's correct.  Ah.  Correct.  I never would have got Sosa, though.  No?  No.  I wouldn't have got Sosa.  Because Sosa says so.  You expect me to believe he has a back injury because Sosa says so. 
[00:32:30]  Mickey Mantle, right?  Willie Mays.  Oh.  Oh, we didn't say Willie Mays?  Hank Aaron, Barry Bonds.  Yeah, I thought Mickey was, like, in the 500s.  That's why I looked at Stump Brain.  I got confused.  It's 600.  So it's Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey Jr.  Wow.  Which one of those things stands out?  Thank God for Babe.  We'd have no claim to anything if it wasn't for Babe. 
[00:33:00]  They took over, didn't they?  The old Bambino.  Oh, my goodness.  Oof.  After J.R. came into the league, it was all of open season on these poor white arms.  I was trying to throw some fastballs, a few change-ups.  Crack over the fence.  Crack over the fence.  Stupid white pitchers.  I'm surprised they didn't, like, get neck injuries looking at the ball flying over the fence.  Oh, mighty.  What do white people do at the plate?  Do we bunt all the time?  All the time, bunt leader.  Bunt.  God, we stink. 
[00:33:30]  Whitey's taking back basketball, though.  Why?  The white European ghetto kids are taking over the league.  I've even noticed that.  They're taking over the league.  So we're taking basketball back.  Yeah.  Baseball, we lost.  We still have hockey.  That's good.  Yeah.  Still got the hockey.  All right.  Hey, and this kind of falls in the sports category.  I cannot believe this one, but it's coming out today that the Oscar De La Hoya pictures are fake. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  I am not buying this at all.  I don't care what the papers are saying.  Basically, the woman that took the pictures is dropping her claim.  We may actually have him tomorrow in the studio.  Right.  Trying to roll into the check-in with the new publicity people.  In my humble opinion, this seems like some kind of, I don't know, backroom deal.  Yep.  It wasn't Fishnet. 
[00:34:30]  It was Photoshop.  Ex-score stripper Milana dropped her $25 million lawsuit against Oscar De La Hoya yesterday  after experts concluded photos of the super welterweight champ in drag that she claimed were real  had been digitally doctored.  Oscars always claimed the photos were false, said the boxer's lawyer.  We had experts conclude that they were doctored.  She was facing very large damages, and so she agreed to drop the case.  The case would have been dismissed anyway.  Now, why isn't Oscar now suing her then? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  For these false claims?  I would be suing her, oof, up to you know what.  Wow.  What do you think, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I mean, look, that one does look a little bizarre.  Oh, I see.  I don't know, man.  The head on that one looks way too big.  What?  Would it?  Oh, okay.  Oof.  I thought you were getting graphic.  Is it possible that they took one or two pictures like that to be really silly? 
[00:35:30]  Like, as a goof, and then she all of a sudden did a whole bunch of Photoshopping?  Yeah, it is.  I mean, maybe he's not suing her because maybe it just happened.  And maybe he knows the public perception of him is more important than getting her money  because she has nothing.  Right.  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of them were real but done to be ridiculous.  Like, what guy wouldn't do that just to goof with it?  I mean, you would do that to goof with a girl.  I mean, that?  Not that you would do to be hot, but I'm saying, like, other ones you might do. 
[00:36:00]  I'm looking at a tiny pink miniskirt with tiny pink panties that you could see under  the miniskirt and fishnet stockings.  I would, I, there's no way I would do that.  Really?  I'm trying to think if there's anything I would do as a goof, and I don't, that, absolutely  not.  She is sexy.  She could get me to put those on in a second.  You would do that in a second?  Without a doubt.  Video cameras rolling.  Yes.  That's why I love you, Jimmy.  I'm not even interested.  Your honesty is great.  I'm not even interested in cross-dressing. 
[00:36:30]  But I'm being honest, too.  I don't, I don't, I don't know how I would do that.  Would you put the bikini top on?  Yes, whatever she wanted.  Oh my God.  Yeah, what's he doing there?  He's doing a little kick line thing.  He can.  There's such a way to find out if those are doctored, because, you know, he's obviously  a boxer, and you see him with his shirt off when he's fighting.  So just look for any identifying marks or, you know, muscle structure, whatever.  But there's so, the only thing is, the only thing is, of all the years, there's so many 
[00:37:00]  photos of him taken in his head in every position, his body in every position.  He's been photographed, you know, probably 500,000 times.  Yeah, where's that one where he's against the wall there, E-Rock, with this?  Would you do that, Jimmy?  Come on.  Would you put the wig on with the fishnet bodysuit and panties underneath the fishnet  that you could obviously see, and the high heels?  I would do all, if she, here's the thing, what turns me on about that is if the girls  are pervert enough to enjoy that, yes, to me, it doesn't really do much. 
[00:37:30]  Panties I might like, because everything looks great in panties, but I personally never  got into that.  But would I, if a girl liked it?  Yeah.  That is so not photoshopped.  It just isn't.  The hat.  Stop it.  The hat's the only thing that bothers me, that whole thing.  The hat, you don't like the hat?  I don't mind the fishnet outfit, but the hat's just silly.  It's like, it looks like a Lower East Side, like, white hipster.  You know those dumb white kids that are wearing, like, the long white t-shirts, and, like,  the hat, like, oh, God, you really don't march to the same beat the rest of us.  Right.  The one with him on the side of the bathtub? 
[00:38:00]  With his junk, uh...  Oh, come on.  Ah.  All right, they're saying it's not photoshopped, so there you go.  What could he have given her to get her to say that when she had, uh...  Obviously, if she had more photos, she would have bought more money.  Yeah.  Spoken like a true lawyer.  Ugh.  Thanks, Iraq.  What happened?  He's showing just disgusting pictures.  Ugh. 
[00:38:30]  Why would it...  You know, I don't know.  That, to me, is something that if a girl brings it up, you gotta just go, what?  What?  Can't we just have straight sex here?  Please?  I have to get into this get-up.  I'm with you on that.  Ugh.  I would, uh...  We're just looking at the pictures now.  Although you...  We're looking at the pictures, because we're...  I'm with Anthony.  I can't...  I can't see how these are photoshopped.  But look at the way the head... 
[00:39:00]  The only thing that's weird to me is, look at the way the head...  It's almost like, uh...  That head in that position could absolutely, if you know what you're doing, have been placed  there.  Or, um...  A couple of the other ones, he's kind of scrunched over, and the head being on top of the body  looks like...  If this is another well-built guy...  I don't know.  I might believe you if he had, like, a bloody eye, or, you know, his lip was all swollen.  Can't you just compare the...  Can't you compare the legs in these photos? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Because, you know, he boxes, obviously...  But I'm just saying, if he boxes in shorts, and they're trying to say they painted on these  fishnets to these legs...  See a boxing glove hitting him in the side of the face?  It's just photoshopped in there.  That would be hysterical.  Well, his head is looking to the left, and it looks like his sweat is flying off his head.  Yeah.  And she's coming out of his mouth.  His mouth is all pushed to the side.  He's smiling there.  I mean, come on. 
[00:40:00]  Well, I don't know.  I would like to take a closer look at them.  I mean, I don't have, uh...  Yeah.  Anything else to say?  I wonder if we'll actually get him as a guest.  It's possible.  We had him once.  I mean, he was a fun guest.  And, uh...  Look.  What's his publicist afraid of?  What's his publicist afraid of?  Look at the picture we're looking at.  Yeah.  Any discussion of that will probably be, oh, you can't talk about it.  Or either that, or he'll be happy.  Oh, here's Roland.  Is Oscar coming in?  He's doing no radio. 
[00:40:30]  No one's doing radio.  That famous...  That famous excuse.  That old guy.  That famous excuse.  Who is publicist?  This is management team now.  What?  But he's done our show before and had a good time.  I know, but they deemed it...  They want to do all safe interviews, so they canceled everybody.  Safe interviews.  That sissy in that non-Photoshopped...  Please, I'm being polite.  We all know that's not Photoshopped.  Of course.  What are we, stupid?  We were trying to be nice for a second, but...  Oh, my God.  Is that obviously...  Of course it's not.  Not Photoshopped.  What is he hiding from?  I mean, it came out today that they're saying it was Photoshopped, and I'm using quotes. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  So what is he afraid of?  Officially, they're Photoshopped pictures.  Well, his book is...  So then you come in here and say, ha-ha, see, I told the world that these were Photoshopped.  Well, his book is an autobiography, and you left that part out of your book.  Of course he did.  Oh, he did?  These effing...  They're all a bunch of phonies.  Every single one of them.  Typical, though.  Every single one of them.  Typical athletes.  I mean, no...  There's just no sense of, like, yeah, I suck, too. 
[00:41:30]  Like, there's no sense of that.  So he just wrote the book, and this is not in the book?  None of the book.  And he doesn't want to come up...  Who's management people?  Who are they?  Why are they...  It's like a new...  It's a different team that he had last time.  Yeah, I know, but who are they?  It's just some people from Miami, like, from boxing.  He has a few boxers, but they know with this...  From Miami, Tony.  Yeah, but it's like he's doing certain news shows.  Is he doing CW11?  Uh, no.  He was booked for tomorrow, and these jerk-offs tell us today? 
[00:42:00]  Well, he canceled all of his press yesterday.  He canceled all of his press?  TV and radio?  Man.  He's only doing certain TV shows, not all of them.  Which ones?  The ones that agree not to talk about this.  Okay.  Don't watch those shows.  That's what I say.  Good luck to you, Oscar.  I have no idea.  Well, Oscar will be fine.  There's a management team that just...  Ah, it's not...  It's Oscar.  Yeah, maybe.  He doesn't want to talk about this.  It's all settled.  It's dealt with.  Now there's an element of doubt thrown in there.  You know, they're saying these are Photoshopped, but now after hearing what he's doing, he might 
[00:42:30]  as well dress just like that and do his interviews, because he's a...  Ha-ha!  That's what he should do.  Well, they tell me he's worried.  I'm like, about what?  I guess, autobiography?  And they go, oh, well, certain things.  I'm like, all right.  Certain things?  Like being in the fishnet stockings with the...  Yeah, his bag showing?  His bat wing?  Exactly.  Bat wing.  Hey, why don't we blow these up?  Why don't we blow these up when they say they were Photoshopped?  Because apparently the world's greatest Photoshopper is working with this Russian stripper in 
[00:43:00]  cahoots.  Yeah.  And now she's just confessing because she feels guilty.  Right.  That's good.  That makes perfect sense, doesn't it?  It sure does.  Yeah.  See how good the Mac is?  Yeah.  Huh?  That's right.  Look.  Help out one of our sponsors.  Look what the Mac could do.  It's the MacBook Mo.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Thank God I used to bang a...  Bang.  I was in love, actually, with a girl who used to have sex with him.  And I know, he's a dirty boy.  Really?  Yes.  You know... 
[00:43:30]  Jimmy knows things, but he's got to be careful.  I'll just say this.  She told me a while ago that, let's just say, that certain people like girls with certain  types of belts.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Those belts with the funny-looking wiggly buckle.  Yeah.  Exactly.  The buckle that makes you go, ouch.  Yeah.  Well, that was back in 2002 she told me that.  He is a dirty, dirty boy.  Those are photoshopped.  Yeah.  Those are the phone landing.  Very windfall. 
[00:44:00]  Another...  Ah, it's so disappointing.  Oscar De La Hoya.  He came in.  We had a good time with the guy.  Yeah.  Go after yourself.  As soon as...  Hope your book tanks, you dope.  As soon as...  As soon as you said he has new management people, I knew...  I knew we weren't going to get him.  Why would we?  That's exactly when I said, ah, we ain't getting him.  And it's extremely suspicious that he's doing safe interviews, even though this is coming  out in the paper today.  Because you know what?  People are going to still ask questions and go, wow.  Really?  They're photoshopped.  I would love people just to scream nice fishnets. 
[00:44:30]  Sweetie.  Sweetie.  Please call him Sweetie.  Call him Sweetie.  If he punches you, you win.  Right.  Easily a mil.  I'd let him...  I mean, Oscar could kill you, but I'd let him knock me in the face once or twice.  That would hurt so much.  Golden.  Remember Goldie?  Hi, Goldie.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hey, Goldie.  Pop.  You get hit in the face.  Fall to the ground.  You just hear that sound in your ears.  Gutshot Drew says it all.  He says she's a dopey stripper.  She doesn't work in Industrial Light and Magic. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, that's what she's doing.  That's exactly right.  You're exactly right.  Lucasfilm helped her out.  I know.  Alien autopsy.  Oh, come on.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Uh, we got Roland in because he's doing what?  What's the bit called officially?  Uh, do you call me Roland?  No, that's not what the bit's called.  I don't know.  Tragic news.  Tragic news.  Tragic news.  I'm just hot.  I'll say you are.  Oh.  Look at him sweating.  You are sweating profusely. 
[00:45:30]  What is wrong with you?  What do you eat for breakfast?  We're in the A.C.  Right.  And blankets?  It's like you're under an invisible shower that just becomes a mess.  It becomes visible when it hits you.  He looks how I felt last night after I ate those chips.  What are you eating?  Your head sweats a lot.  What are you eating dollops of a Lestra for breakfast?  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  Did you eat anything today?  No.  I leave my apartment all happy. 
[00:46:00]  Then I step outside and start sweating.  I'm sweating.  For the people that don't know, Roland doesn't own a winter jacket.  No.  Even in the middle of winter when it gets really cold, he walks around with short-sleeved shirts.  It's the most amazing thing I think I've ever seen doing this radio show.  Yeah, and I still sweat.  I've had to meet him.  We went to a Ranger game, and I had not only a winter coat on, I had a puffy coat.  I had gloves.  I had a hat, and I meet Roland on the corner.  We're going to take a cab to the garden, and he's just standing out there in his Who t-shirt. 
[00:46:30]  I'm serious.  It was probably in the teens.  Was he sweating?  No, but he wasn't.  Frozen sweat on his head.  Somehow he figured out that one.  It's tragic news with Roland up in a few minutes.  Yeah.  I like when it does this.  See how it's now going into his eyes?  Yeah.  And it's like he's been maced.  He can't see.  If he ever wanted to attack someone sexually, they would all have to do is just turn the  heat up in the apartment, and his own sweat would blind him, and he'd fall off. 
[00:47:00]  Was it obvious that I was playing devil's advocate and trying to just not blow up an interview  tomorrow?  Yeah.  That's all right.  Yeah.  See, the head was kind of put on there.  Yes, as was the lady's clothing.  Yeah.  It was put on there by God.  What is he scared of?  He's got the advantage.  He's a boxer.  It doesn't matter.  We have...  Yeah, but he's the boxer.  But we have those photos.  Those will take four Foreman shots, and Ollie and Frazier.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And pictures of you like...  No other boxer has ever been photographed like that. 
[00:47:30]  You picture George Foreman like that before the rumble in the jungle?  No.  And Mobutu having photos of him in a little tutu?  Walking his German Shepherd, pair of underpants.  Or Ollie, can you picture Ollie?  Ollie.  Yeah.  Waving with his buttocks showing and pairs of assless chaps.  A little summer dress.  The famous photo of him standing over Sonny Liston.  Standing over Sonny Liston, but instead of boxing shorts, he's got little panties on. 
[00:48:00]  A halter top.  A halter top.  A hot pink boy short.  Right.  And Sonny's laying down, but his eyes are open, and he's going like, whoo, like he's  been slayed by Ollie's beauty.  All right.  Well...  Thank you, Roland.  Get ready for your tragic news.  There you go.  Wow.  We're going to do that next.  We're a sweaty mess.  Look at him.  Oh, man.  Can you imagine what his underpants smell like?  Horrendous.  Jeez.  I bet they smell like the rag that the garbage man carried to clean the back of the truck. 
[00:48:30]  The only reason I said that, it was more of a visual.  Roland walked away, and he was just slumping and trying to pull up his sweaty jeans.  Yeah, you know, they're just all sticky and heavy.  He's sweating so much that his jeans are wet.  They're just all heavy on him because they're soaked.  Poor guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Bring me your boils, your goiters, your wretched penile discharge, yearning to breathe free. 
[00:49:00]  It's the return of Weird Medicine on the Saturday Night Virus.

[00:49:30]  Hazy, hot, and humid.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was Umbrella Day in New York City yesterday.  Too many people with umbrellas.  Umbrellas.  That seems like it would be more of a hassle than it's worth.  Carrying an umbrella around in 100-degree weather just so you're kind of in the shade the whole time?  Block the sun.  When you walk around the city, don't you just find shade on your own? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  You don't need to, like, carry your shade.  I don't get it.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  A couple quick hits.  Bravo to Michael Strahan.  I'm not a Giants fan.  I'm not a Giants fan.  I wanted the Pats.  I'm a Jets fan, actually.  But it's pretty cool to go to retire on top, and that's what Michael Strahan's doing.  He's out.  I knew he would be out, by the way. 
[00:50:30]  Ever since the Giants won the Super Bowl here in New York, he's being seen every other day celebrating and partying.  So you've got to think he wasn't doing much lifting in the last few months, getting ready for the upcoming football season.  So he's retiring.  You've got Elliot Spitzer.  He's turning 49 today.  Well, happy birthday, Elliot Spitzer.  Looks a lot older.  He's certainly aged a bit in the past few months.  That guy's in hell, too.  And what's going on? 
[00:51:00]  His wife is being seen kind of just out and about and going to functions without him and stuff.  I'm hearing it both ways, that they're being filmed together and photographed together, and then she's doing her own thing as well.  But the one thing you know is he's in hell because he can't get away with anything anymore.  You know damn well he wants to be with a young hot body.  He was, yeah, apparently that wasn't his first time.  No.  And when you have that just taken away from you, wow, yeah, he's got to be going a little crazy. 
[00:51:30]  Taken away from you, and you don't have a gig, so now you don't have the excuses to leave town.  Yeah.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  So he's just wandering around his apartment here in New York City going, oh my God.  Angry wife.  He's got to be frothing.  Around him all the time.  He's got to be frothing.  I think he's probably going at himself like a monkey.  I don't even think he could do that.  Just having to relieve himself.  I don't think he could even get close to a computer without suspicion.  Well, maybe he could just use a mental image of his past crimes. 
[00:52:00]  And everybody knows, though.  It's like everybody knows what he did, too.  So you really can't get away with anything because you're spuck up blunt in front of the whole country.  Yeah.  What are you going to do, pick up a hooker on the street somewhere?  Honey, what do you want for your birthday?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know what he wants.  I'm looking at a picture.  Yeah.  We're trying to get to a point where this radio show is a Anthelini free zone.  Yeah.  We're trying to. 
[00:52:30]  That's fine.  That's, you know.  We're trying to fade out of Anthony's relationship because, you know, we went pretty heavy on it the last month or so.  Well, because it was kind of a big thing, you know, when it first came up.  A lot of people were very surprised.  So this is real, huh?  Yeah.  It's completely real.  We went to.  I'm starting to think this might be a real relationship.  Yeah.  Now that you're heading to what, three weeks?  Yeah.  Three weeks.  We went to the Crescent Club golf course last night. 
[00:53:00]  Ooh.  For a function.  That's my old stomping ground.  Yes.  Want to say hi to the boys that are still caddying well into their 50s.  Get a life.  What are you doing?  Get into radio.  I enjoyed caddying too, but I tapped out at 25, 26 years old.  Yeah.  We went for the Clark Gillies Foundation.  By the way, that was a joke.  I love those guys.  Of course you do.  I really do.  I still say it was my favorite job of all time, being a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club.  Caddy.  Did you run into John Schober or any of the boys?  I don't know any of those guys.  What were you doing there? 
[00:53:30]  I was hanging out.  Yeah?  With some of the famous Islanders of yesteryear.  You know?  Bobby Nystrom.  Oh, the boys that won it all.  Yeah.  Clark Gillies runs the charity.  Mm-hmm.  What a good guy.  Jesus.  For a guy that just kicked the crap out of people on the ice, he's making up for it.  He's got a great charity.  Takes care of little kids with cancer. 
[00:54:00]  So he takes care of them.  So I was like hanging out and...  Wait, but you don't like kids.  You could care less about kids.  Yeah, but I don't want them to get cancer.  God, that's pretty bad.  At least we found your line.  That's good.  That's my line.  That's how I like kids.  That's wonderful.  That is pretty awful.  That's my line.  Real Mother Teresa.  Well, I don't want kids to get cancer.  Well, easy, softy.  Yeah.  I'm really softening up. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Kyle LaFontaine.  Did you get close enough to Clark Gillies to see all the scars?  He's got some impressive...  He's pretty close to him.  He's got impressive scars on his face from all the fighting he did.  Talking to him for a little while.  He's a fan of the F.H. Riley's, too.  Yeah.  Goes to F.H. Riley's.  A few of the guys who are fans of the show.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  Which ones?  It's...  The winners or the losers?  No, the winners.  Meaning the guys that won the cup?  Yeah.  Of course.  Not the guys that came after the cup?  No. 
[00:55:00]  That had to deal with year after year of people going,  Oh, when are you going to win the cup again?  The drive for five?  That never happened?  The drive for five 25 years later?  I think that's the new slogan this coming hockey season.  Well, that's cool.  You had a good time, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a lot of fun.  Hung out.  I think I got more functions this week.  Yeah.  What's that about?  I don't know.  We go to functions.  We go to things.  But we say no to all functions. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, but now I go.  Because now it's not me and you going.  It's me and Jill going.  See what's going on?  We're a power couple.  Well, in your own minds.  We are a power couple.  In your own minds.  We're boyfriend and girlfriend.  Oh, Jimmy's got a picture in his hand.  Yeah.  I see one up on the monitor.  Speaking of the picture.  If you guys were a power couple.  Now, you guys got a photographer, a professional photographer following you to all these functions.  Why haven't we seen one picture in the newspapers if you're a power couple? 
[00:56:00]  Because they're so ridiculous, these pictures.  This is just like Brangelina.  Hey.  You know, they can't even go to Starbucks without a picture in the paper.  It was reported in the paper.  I just want to see one picture in the paper of this power couple.  It was reported in the paper.  And until there's some kind of scandal, they won't report it.  There is a scandal.  What?  Shock Jock is dating a 10.  That's the scandal. 
[00:56:30]  What?  It should be everywhere.  It's a nice photo.  Yeah, well, we're getting to the photos that are now up on onaradio.com.  Yes?  Yeah, it's up there.  We teased these pictures yesterday, and we finally got them.  Anthony and Jill Nicolini went to Nashville.  And, boy, I'm looking at a picture of the same one Jimmy's looking at.  I'm not looking at it.  It's off the screen.  Oh, where Anthony and Jill are wearing cowboy hats, and they're making the pa-choo, pa-choo with their hands. 
[00:57:00]  Jimmy, you see the pa-choo, pa-choo?  I do.  And then behind them is a wall of hats.  Yes.  Cowboy hats.  It was a Western attire store, you know, where they sell hats and shirts and everything Western.  And I can assure you I did not leave that spot dressed like that.  But we thought it would be funny to take a picture when we're both kind of gussied up in the garb.  So I put on that turquoise blue and black shirt and a big black cowboy hat. 
[00:57:30]  And Jill put on a darker cowboy shirt and a hat.  And we took funny pictures.  And she has two, like, little above.  They're not little.  No.  I was with you on that.  I just got too little.  So I'm like, really?  Two piano, like, above the breasts on the shirt, like, above the shirt pockets are, like, these piano keys.  Piano keys.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like a, you know, because it's Nashville and it's a music city, you know? 
[00:58:00]  And she actually looks really good in that outfit.  And you don't look as bad as I want you to.  Oh, I look like a douche.  Believe me, you should be pa-choo, pa-chooing.  I wish that you were pointing your two fingers at your temple.  You've got to go to Vegas in that get-up and play some hold'em.  Let me see the other one there, Iraq.  The one that's similar to that.  But it looks like you should have some cards in your hand.  See, that's our smug look.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  That's more smug.  We're not doing the pa-choo, pa-choo.  We're just kind of standing there.  Yeah.  Can I tell you a secret?  In this one, where they're not smiling and goofing, Anthony really thinks he looks good in that outfit.  That's a moment where he's like, you know what?  I mean, even though we're joking around, this is a nice picture of us.  No, no.  I swear to you, I thought I looked ridiculous the entire time.  Believe me.  She is fantastic.  How does she look great in that outfit?  I know, doesn't she?  Well, what can I say?  Well, the pictures are up on... 
[00:59:00]  People don't like me fawning on the air.  Fawn?  But I'll fawn.  You can fawn.  You can.  Of course, I'm fawning.  I'll fawn all I want.  I'll fawn for you.  Fawn, fawn, fawn.  It's fun to fawn.  I was in Niagara Falls recently, and there is a picture out there of me in front of a green screen.  Yeah?  Getting a picture in front of the falls.  Oh, really?  Did you take a picture where you put your head out the hole of the barrel?  Like you're going over the falls in the barrel? 
[00:59:30]  No.  Is there a picture of you pumpkin picking?  Oh, yeah, there is.  No.  Mark and Philly, what's up?  What's up, Monet?  Well, you do silly things, right?  When you're in a relationship.  You do.  Maybe I'll bring in my Niagara Falls picture.  They're calling me Anthony De La Hoya.  No, it's not that bad, okay?  There it is.  Wow, you punched it up quick.  Yeah.  There's Opie in a big, giant pumpkin house.  Ew.  Look at Jimmy.  Ew.  I didn't even saw that.  Exactly.  How fantastic is the giant pumpkin house picture? 
[01:00:00]  And you're trying to look cool, kind of leaning your arms out, like, hey, guys, here I am.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's a terrible photo.  Exactly.  Mark and Philly, what's up?  Opie, you have to be the voice of common sense here.  I think we're on maybe day 19, and this fool's already about to say I love you.  When do you think about...  Ah, time out, Mark.  Time out.  Anthony said I love you a long time ago.  About to.  Yeah.  We have professed our love for each other.  What day did you say I love you? 
[01:00:30]  Hour 10.  His email tour asking the direction so he could Google map them in a picture of them.  That's a brave move because I knew I was in love way before I said it, but I was too scared  to say it.  I had to take my time with that.  You jumped right in with the I love you.  We both, you know, we're doing about 200 miles an hour here.  That's how we work.  Seeing how they're on the accelerated schedule here, what day do you think Anthony's going 
[01:01:00]  to realize that nothing lasts forever?  I don't know.  Of course nothing lasts forever.  Jeez, depress me.  I said it yesterday, it's either going to be the best thing that ever happens to my pal  Anthony or the worst.  Yeah.  There's no middle ground on this one.  Yeah.  But he's going to enjoy himself as it goes along here.  Yes.  And, you know, they're...  Like, how many days are you up to?  21. 
[01:01:30]  Three weeks today.  Yes.  It's three weeks today.  What are you doing to celebrate your three-week anniversary?  Our three-week anniversary.  Because last week, for your two-week anniversary, you went to F.H. Riley's, right?  Yes, we did.  What are you doing for your three-week anniversary?  I don't know.  We might head back to that old place where we had our first anniversary and our second.  F.H. Riley's.  Ah, nice.  I'm happy that the, quote, power couple is going to F.H. Riley's.  Yes.  Their restaurant of choice, but... 
[01:02:00]  Power couple.  Dude, it just hit me.  Yeah.  When I said three weeks, I swear to God, it feels like you guys have been dating for...  Eight years.  Yeah, really.  I would say months.  Three or four months.  That's what we said.  Three weeks.  That's scary.  We've done so much in such a short amount of time that it does seem, you know...  And in those three weeks, I think there's only been probably two or three days or nights  and stuff, you know, that we haven't spent together. 
[01:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  We just hang out.  It's a lot of fun.  But now you're doing a lot of functions, something we refuse to do as radio guys, but now you're  like...  You have a full schedule every week.  Yes, I have a full schedule.  What other functions do you have to do this week?  I don't know.  Well, there's some kind of a thing, I think a extreme fighting thing going on at Roseland.  Very cool.  That'll be going...  I think, yeah, I think Jimmy would want to be invited to that, and I believe you are. 
[01:03:00]  Who's fighting?  I don't know.  I'll let you know.  Please, when?  That security guard who was a complete douche?  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be good to see him get his ass handed to him?  Who's he fighting besides his childhood demons that cause him to overeat?  Yeah, so, yeah, I'm just, you know, we're having fun.  Cool.  And in that picture, doesn't it look like we're having fun?  Yeah, I would like to kind of goof on you, but...  Oh, please do, because I was goofing on myself. 
[01:03:30]  I'm seeing something that I don't think I ever saw in you.  Aw.  That would be happiness.  Oh, I thought you meant a strap-on.  Yeah, well.  Happiness and scared S-less at the same time.  Aw, look at that.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Look at Anthony's nice, new, neat hairdo.  It's a picture of us just hanging out at a nice little restaurant. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Anthony's making seductive eyes at the camera.  Anthony's giving sexy eyes to the camera.  I was trying, you know.  Of course he is.  He's trying to hold on for dear life.  That's how I roll.  Yeah.  He's got some competition.  He's going to make sure he's got clear eyes, and he's got...  Competition?  He's mean that there's other guys that like her.  I'm trying to be charming.  No, I didn't even mean that.  I'm just, as far as, like, you know, it's got to be tough being photographed with a 10.  Yeah.  So, you know, you've got to try to look good at all times.  You can't, though.  It doesn't matter.  It's very difficult.  Who's she going to look good next to? 
[01:04:30]  I mean, anybody, all you do is look at her anyway.  Oh, there's a guy there?  Thank God she likes personality.  Believe me, being funny gets you a long way.  No disrespect to you, of course, but what do you think?  She admired your muscles in an ONA foundry video, and like, I have to have that guy?  I think she saw you on the news walking on one of the suspensions and went, what a build?  One of.  I thought the athletes were really hunky, but this guy. 
[01:05:00]  Which one of your videos in this stupid hooded giant parka as you're shivering like a little girl do you think turned her on?  All right.  I get it.  Yeah, I know.  I just wanted to have one other example.  Teasing, of course.  I like the final example, though, is the best one.  Yes, with my big hooded jacket that I wear in the winter.  All right, Roland is going to be after the break because we're running late, but he's going to do Tragic News.  Love it.  With a twist.  If you haven't heard it yet, it's worth sticking around.  We'll tease it one more time before it's obvious to everybody what we do with Roland as he does Tragic News. 
[01:05:30]  And then we've got a quickie real fast before we go to break.  A guy is on the news, and he's from KARK.  He's a reporter.  His name is Isaiah Carey.  Tark, Tark.  This guy gets a bug in his mouth.  Oh, God.  That happens, you know?  Bug in his mouth.  Some bugs don't go away so easy either.  Gets a bug in his mouth. 
[01:06:00]  Yep, yep.  Yeah.  Gets a bug in his mouth, and the guy turns ghetto instantly.  Really?  So I guess he has to play, quote, white on TV.  Uh-huh.  But when something happens, he goes right into ghetto.  Okay.  That is our observation with this clip.  Listen.  What really happened on that Thursday here at Augusta High School that led to Chris Wood?  You hear high school?  Yeah.  Like he's at deaf comedy.  Really happened at Augusta High School. 
[01:06:30]  But we don't know.  You know, the black comic acting white because that's how whitey sounds?  Yeah.  And the black audience laughs and laughs.  Oh, they love when they point out the differences between black people and white people.  I love when the black comic has to act white.  It's nothing like how we act.  It's always like this.  Well, okay, honey.  I'm mowing the lawn now.  I'm paying the bills.  Ha, ha, ha.  You know.  What really happened on that Thursday here at Augusta High School that led to Chris Wood's death?  What the f*** is that? 
[01:07:00]  What the f*** is that?  I'm dying in this f***ing country-ass f***ed up town.  That f*** is flying in my mouth.  The f***.  I can't see politics.  Let's get the f*** out of this country, mother f***.  I can't see me.  Wow.  What a f***.  Holy jeez.  Did he really put that on?  The opposite code.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  Wow.  Could he be darker?  Damn, yeah.  The video will be up on onaradio.com. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  You want to hear that again?  He is as white as could be as he's doing his report.  Got a bug in his mouth.  Damn.  Listen to the change again.  What really happened on that Thursday here at Augusta High School that led to Chris Wood's death?  What the f*** is that?  I'm dying in this f***ing country-ass f***ed up town.  F***ing flying in my mouth. 
[01:08:00]  The f***er.  I can't see politics.  Let's get the f*** out of this country, mother f***er.  I can't see me.  That's how phony reporters are.  That is exactly...  He should be sounding like that all the time.  Yeah.  Scott from Hoppog.  He's having a good day.  With the radio show, he writes, there's no way that's the same guy.  That is the same guy.  Yeah.  You can see it for yourself on onaradio.com.  And there's also audio of the bug commenting. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  Rolling with Tragic News next.  How's everybody this morning?  It's always awkward to ask questions on a radio show.  You don't get an answer.  I know.  Waiting for an answer for years.  How is everyone?  Nothing.  877-212-O-N-A.  In grace.  What else is going on in the world?  Well, we got game three tonight.  Yes.  Celtics lead in the series. 
[01:09:00]  Two zip over the Lakers.  Playing in L.A.  Obama rips McCain over economy.  Really?  What does, um, what did McCain do to the economy?  I blame Bush, not McCain.  Yeah.  And then when McCain's president, I'll blame him.  And the oil companies.  Big oil, man.  Uh, speaking of oil, Saudi Arabia calls for oil summit to discuss rising prices. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, yeah?  But they control that.  So why do they have to have a summit?  Why don't they just drop oil prices?  Just, yeah, lower the prices.  Why do they have to discuss it?  Pump out more oil.  It's a nightmare.  Everyone knows it's a nightmare.  Drop your price.  End of discussion.  They really do hold the world hostage.  They truly do.  I mean, the entire world economy is based on oil. 
[01:10:00]  You know, nothing can get done without it.  It drives the price of everything up.  Not just because of transportation, but, you know, petroleum is in a lot of crap.  Yeah, people forget.  I mean, they think, oh, gas prices.  But you're right.  It affects everything.  It affects everything.  At my brother's restaurant, he's turning off, like, the ovens and everything in between lunch and dinner.  Yeah.  And most restaurants, they just let that stuff run all day long.  But now with the gas prices where they're at, some of these restaurants are shutting down their stuff in between meals. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, it's really, it's just the price of everything is going up because of oil.  And they pretty much write the rules.  OPEC sits there and goes, you know, we're not going to pump out more oil.  Screw you.  And the price has doubled in no time.  What's the end game, you think?  Another revolution?  Because we're not going backwards.  They keep raising our taxes.  Gas prices are going up.  It's getting harder and harder to support a family out there.  I mean, just can't buy gas for their cars. 
[01:11:00]  Just in our lifetime, you had one parent that worked.  That is rare now.  Both parents are working.  A lot of the parents out there are doing more than one job apiece.  And how does this, what's the, seriously, what's the end game?  It's got to be like a house of cars and the whole thing has to eventually collapse  because the government's not going to take care of it.  Well, no empire lasts forever.  I understand that.  That's all we are.  So eventually, you know, the United States won't be.  It's got to just be broken down again and start, and then we start over.  Start over, send some people off somewhere to conquer something. 
[01:11:30]  Because we broke away from England for the exact things that are happening to us now.  Yeah.  Overtaxed and paying too much for crap.  But we just kind of got used to it over time.  Mm-hmm.  Because they didn't hit us all at once.  Imagine one day.  Imagine if it went from what it was.  I love your theory.  To then they just hit us in one day with all this stuff.  There would be a revolution.  Gunfire in the streets.  But they do a little at a time.  You've got the best analogy. 
[01:12:00]  Go with it.  What, the frog?  That one?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the old one.  People know that one.  But I love that one.  Yeah, you put a frog in water and put it on the stove and turn it up, turn the heat up,  and he'll just sit there and boil.  Right.  And by the time he realizes it's really hot, it's too late to jump out of the pot.  He'll just swim around.  But just imagine that same frog.  Throw him in boiling water?  He's going to be a little pissed.  Oh, boy, is he.  Boy, is he.  And that's what the government does to us.  Yeah, they slowly turn the heat up on us, they tax us, and just, it's a mess now. 
[01:12:30]  I really do think we have to kill environmentalists.  What?  I think they have to be killed so that we can drill for oil everywhere.  How about the oil executives?  They're the ones who are jacking the price up.  They're the scum.  What's wrong with me?  But OPEC is raising the price because they're not supplying enough oil.  So the price per barrel goes up, and that isn't really the oil company's fault. 
[01:13:00]  It is, because they would never sacrifice any kind of profit for the betterment of the country, ever.  They're garbage.  And I'm sick of every American president holding hands like a girl in the garden with these animals.  I'm tired of depending on them.  Can we just stop dealing with these pigs and start working on our own alternative energy source?  It's not that difficult.  All right?  We could just come on.  I know we're set up for rolling here, but Jimmy just mentioned something, and I've got to play this really fast. 
[01:13:30]  Alternative energy sources, right?  Uh-huh.  We've got another dope out there that invented a car that runs on water.  Oh, you poor dead bastard.  Yeah, exactly.  With gas prices hovering at their highest levels ever, a Jacksonville man thinks he has found the answer,  and it comes out of the tap.  Anthony Brown says he has fixed his car to run mostly on water.  Sure, it does take a little bit of gas, but Brown says the car is getting just fuel vapor. 
[01:14:00]  When you separate the water from the oxygen from the hydrogen, it cooks, and it cooks down to a brown.  If we're not having any waste product off of it, everything's consumed and burned.  Open up.  Open sesame.  How about that?  And get this.  The car is getting 100 miles to the ounce of water.  Hello?  So, why is he not, you know, a millionaire?  Why is he not in Detroit making cars right now?  I think that maybe is about to happen. 
[01:14:30]  Buy a ticket.  We'll find out.  No, it's not about to happen, you dumb anchor woman.  No, I think...  This guy is so dead.  Why isn't he in Detroit making...  What?  Oh, boy, that poor bastard.  Our government doesn't want to hear this stuff.  He's so dead.  The government doesn't want a car that gets you 100 miles on the ounce?  Runs on water.  100 miles to the ounce. 
[01:15:00]  To the ounce?  This guy's going to get food poisoning in the very near future.  Oh, yeah.  Extreme food poisoning.  He's going to grab his throat in a restaurant and go like...  Collapse.  The Illuminati doesn't want to hear this.  No.  This guy's so dead.  Keep your invention to yourself if you want to live a long, healthy life.  Meetings about guys like this.  I'm convinced that we could make cars that run on water.  Yeah.  But it would collapse the entire economy.  And the government doesn't want that to happen. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  So going back to Anthony's, like, boiling the water slowly, they'll allow some of this  to slowly be introduced into our society.  Like you just said, imagine if all of a sudden...  Tomorrow, if they said, okay, trade in your gas guzzler for a car that runs on water, the  whole economy would collapse.  The government can't allow that to happen.  It's based on oil.  Right.  Oof.  So this guy is in deep trouble.  Yeah.  Deep trouble.  Bye-bye, funny man. 
[01:16:00]  Adios.  Yeah.  We love those stories, though.  All right.  He's in studio.  Rolling, everyone.  How are you, Roland?  Yeah, all right.  Still sweating?  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  What's wrong, Roland?  Oh, nothing.  Okay.  Thumbs up?  Yeah.  You just gave a thumbs up.  I don't know.  TNN, the Tragic News Network, with your anchor, Roland. 
[01:16:30]  Hey, it's Roland.  Dayline, Tokyo, Japan.  A man armed with a knife has killed seven people and injured ten others in a busy shopping district  that is popular with tourists.  The police arrested 25-year-old Tomihiro Patako, who told the police that he was tired of life  and came there to kill people. 
[01:17:00]  The suspect drove a rented truck into a crowd.  He drove his rented truck into the crowd and then got out and started randomly stabbing people.  Killing six men between the ages of 19 and 72 and a 21-year-old woman.  Come on.  And from Canada, more tragic news. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, Canada.  Oh, Canada.  Elementary school children playing in the backyard of a quiet Canadian suburb made a grisly find.  They discovered a suitcase filled with dismembered human bodies.  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  The kids saw a headless, armless, and legless coriombs.  Eleven-year-old Tommy Williams found the suitcase.  It was the first to open it and see the body.  He says the smell was so bad that he threw up twice. 
[01:18:00]  Yee-hee-hee-hee.  They ran home to tell his mom.  Patricia Williams said her son appears to be doing well for the moment.  They added, I hope he doesn't have no nightmares.  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  And then more tragic news.  Yeah.  And right here in New York City, a tragedy is revealed in court.  A Columbia University graduate student who was raped, beaten, and burned last... 
[01:18:30]  Was raped, beaten, and burned last year, testified Friday.  She thought she would die after a 19-hour nightmare began.  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  The 24-year-old woman said she resisted when her attacker forced his way into the Manhattan apartment and grabbed her.  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  When he put the chokehold on me, I started to black out.  I thought I was going to die.  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee. 
[01:19:00]  And the victim said, I wanted to survive, so I did what I...  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  I told him what...  I did what he told me.  The attacker raped Saddammeister.  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  Slay her eyes...  Threw bleach in her eyes...  Yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  Oh, my God!  Bleach her eyes, uh... 
[01:19:30]  Massive dose of painkillers  and cause lizard liver failure.  Any more tragic news?  More tragic news in Florida.  Hillsborough County officials say  a woman was hit and killed by a car  after getting out of her own car  to check out the owl she had.  The sheriff's office said 
[01:20:00]  six-year-old Jean Pierce  was driving Sunday night  in the Killsville near Tampa  where she hid now  in the middle of the road  and pulling over and checked a bird.  She was hit by another vehicle  Pierce died at the scene. 
[01:20:30]  No charges have been filed yet  against a driver who has not been identified  the accident is still being investigated.  Looking for more news.  Oh, it's the same one.  Any more tragic news?  A four-year-old girl  had shot herself at Sam's Club in Ohio. 
[01:21:00]  And now it's quickly  in a non-credited condition.  According to the police,  the girl was being taken around the store  in a shopping cart by her grandmother.  Police say the grandmother  had a gun in her purse.  While the grandmother  was pushing the girl  near a pharmacy area,  officers said the little girl  took out the gun  out of the purse  and shot herself in the chest.  Jesus! 
[01:21:30]  Come on!  The girl  emergency started  Monday afternoon.  Police said  have been told  by the family  members of the girl  suffered no damage  to her major organs.  Police say  the grandmother  has a valid weapon permit  and no charges  have been filed  in the case.  Dummy.  And pretty much  more tragic news. 
[01:22:00]  A bond hearing  is scheduled today  for a South Florida man  who police said  hurled his mother's dog  to death  from a four-story  balcony.  Authorities say  50-year-old  Carlos Vieira  was charged  with animal cruelty  yesterday morning  after throwing the dog  off the balcony  of Kendall's apartment.  Vendor told police 
[01:22:30]  he was depressed  about his divorce  and took his anger  out on the dog.  And in more tragic news  police say  that they have  indicted  a man suspected  of being a serial rapist  who preyed  on the elderly  in Wayne County.  DNA and other  forensic evidence  helped authorities  identify the suspect  and possibly solve  the crime  against senior citizens  that spanned  11 years. 
[01:23:00]  Kindred has acquired  a rural community  in southeast  Wayne County  where several break-ins  and sexual assault  against elderly women  in their 70s,  80s,  90s  took place.  In two of the  ten attacks  the suspect  disguises himself  as a piece  of delivery man. 
[01:23:30]  Tom Richhouse  faces multiple charges  of rape  and attempted rape.  Last story?  Last story  in this tragic news  from Australia.  Yeah, I know.  We really know  how to take something  and just  No kidding.  Just  thrash it into a building.  Traged news from Australia.  A handicapped elderly man  is in critical condition  after a neighborhood  ran him over  and left  to go shopping. 
[01:24:00]  Troopers say  Dana Greco  was backing her  Cadillac  out of the driveway  at the same time  her neighbor  Thurman Gale  74 was using  his cane  to walk down  the street.  Police say  she backed  into him  and made  I realized  she then  went to the  store  and came back  and forth  what she had done.  Neighbors that  helped out  said they don't  know  how this could  happen.  You see  blood all over  the victim. 
[01:24:30]  Charles Cript  he was laying  pretty still.  His walker  his cane  was pretty  laying pretty still.  He wasn't moving.  And she was  driving a big SUV  and it was black  with tinted windows  and you can't  see out of him.  You think she  feels something  but possibly  she didn't.  This has been  the Tragic News  Network  with your anchor 
[01:25:00]  Tickle Me Rowan.  Let's say hi  to Kevin in New  Jersey.  Kevin what's up?  Oh no more.  Yeah.  You know what  I'm laughing my  butt off  but I don't know  why.  What is wrong  with this guy?  What has he got?  He's very ticklish  so just to tear  down a wall  today for the  last time  Danny tickles  him as he does  the Tragic News  and if you think  he's making this  up you gotta  see the videos.  It's very obvious  that he can't 
[01:25:30]  handle someone  tickling him.  No.  Yeah and  then you got  Pierce Mark  from Whackbag  he writes  I like the  I like the  first six minutes  of the bit  the last  eleven minutes  might have  dragged a bit.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Good job guys.  Alright thank you.  Let's go to  Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn Ace  what's up?  Good morning boys.  How are you sir?  Roland  those are some  sad stories man  you're laughing  at them?  Yeah why are you  laughing at those  stories there Roland?  Because people 
[01:26:00]  are tickling me.  I don't believe  that for a second  I think you just  think they're funny.  Because people  are tickling me.  Yeah.  My favorite part  of that is  obviously Roland  being tickled  but even more so  it's his abominable  pronunciation.  Oh yeah.  Yeah it's bad.  It's just  horrible.  You almost don't  understand what  he's reading.  Metzito  it's mind boggling.  Canna  Canna  Instead of Canada  he says Canna  It's like you take 
[01:26:30]  like what you like  to do is take words  that have bumps in  them and just  smooth them out.  Canna  Canna  They're calling you  dumb DeLuise  Dumb DeLuise  Gotta give Kevin  from Connecticut  credit for that one.  That's a good one.  People either love  the bit or hate  the bit.  Yep.  More people  loving the bit  but there's definitely  some haters out there.  Thank you Roland.  We got Ricky Gervais  calling in  in a mere 
[01:27:00]  what few minutes  here?  Yes.  We'll take a quick  break and we'll get  to that next.  Opie and Anthony.  We gotta get right  back into the radio  show.  It's Opie and Anthony  and very excited.  We wish he was in  studio but we'll  take a phone or  any time from  Ricky Gervais.  Ricky!  Hello.  How are you sir?  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  How are you?  Very good.  I hear you're  having a bit of a  heat wave in New York  aren't you?  Yes.  Disgusting.  It's like 125 today.  That's ridiculous.  Where are you?  I mean I'm back in 
[01:27:30]  London.  Okay.  Is it hot there?  It's nice.  It's like you know  75 so I'm  and I don't  I mean I sweat  because I'm a fat  bloke but even I'm  not sweating so it's  just right.  Are you one of these  guys that believe in  global warming or you  don't believe?  In all honesty  from what I've heard  it's definitely going  to happen but I'm  going to be dead.  Yeah so who cares  right?  Yeah exactly.  Do you know what I  mean?  I mean that was their  mistake keep saying 
[01:28:00]  it's not you but it's  your children and your  children's children so  fine.  I mean they really  they also shouldn't  have called it global  warming because you  know we're quite  excited in Europe  about that.  Yeah.  Yeah because it's  pretty gloomy and  cloudy and rainy.  You would like a  little more sunshine  over there.  They really have  played the whole  thing terribly terribly  badly so yeah not  my fault.  It's disgusting.  It's like this morning  I leave my apartment  at 540 to get here 
[01:28:30]  and it's already  daylight and it's  just muggy and thick  and it's like you  understand why  violence really goes  up when it gets to  be hot because you  just want to attack  somebody physically.  Well so be careful  remember what happened  with the tramp.  Who was the tramp?  The hobo as you  call him.  Hobo.  What happened  with the hobo?  Wow.  Didn't you get in  trouble for a hobo  saying things about  the queen and  Condoleezza Rice?  Yes.  A hobo.  Almost Charlie.  Oh yeah yeah yeah.  Almost Charlie ruled.  Yeah.  I just want to attack  him.  He really did. 
[01:29:00]  He was hilarious.  It's too bad that we  got in trouble for what  a homeless guy was  ranting about.  I thought Ricky was  talking about gay guys  and had a cold.  Hey our buddy Roland has  already seen Ghost Town  right Roland?  And he says he loved  the movie.  Oh that's great.  And it's not even  coming out for what  another few months?  I think obviously you  get it first.  You are the United  States.  You are the world. 
[01:29:30]  Yes we are.  As Michael Jackson  sang.  Yeah exactly.  You are the world.  You're the bit that  matters.  You get it on 19th  of September and  let old England get  it on the 24th of  October.  Wow.  And then Europe and  Wait wait wait wait.  Why is that?  I mean I understand for  maybe movies starring  American actors but  you're huge all over  the world obviously but  you're from over there  so you think they would  release the movie for  you guys first. 
[01:30:00]  Well I think it's a  good idea for it to  because it's an  American movie.  It's set in New York.  It would be nice to  come home being a  conquering hero as  opposed to come out  in England and  people think it wasn't  good enough to be  released in America.  Yeah.  That's our attitude in  England.  We were suspicious.  It really I think we  invented the phrase  familiarity breeds  contempt.  Do you know what I  mean?  So there's nothing  exotic about it so  I've got to come to  England with it going  and it was huge in 
[01:30:30]  America honestly.  Believe me.  And I will be if  you're in case you're  asking a lot of  people have asked me  so are you playing an  American?  No I'll be doing the  same accent as I did in  the office extras and  every other cameo I've  done.  I will be using my own  accent and the same  haircut.  If I played Genghis Khan  he'd talk like this  he'd have this haircut.  There'd be I'd be this  color.  I'm not getting there  two hours early for  makeup.  It's ridiculous.  It's not worth it.  It's just a film.  It's not worth killing  yourself over.  So yeah I'll be doing 
[01:31:00]  my usual.  Ricky that's the beauty  of you.  You've got to watch  your project for about  10 or 15 minutes to  see what role you are  playing because your  look doesn't change.  Like Robin Williams  he does the beard.  Okay.  Serious Robin Williams.  See?  He knows how to mix it  up a little bit with  the look.  Never mind all that  Daniel Day-Lewis  nonsense.  Yeah.  Look I've got a funny  eye or I've got one  left foot.  Big deal.  Hey Ricky we uh I  just as we're talking  to you I just got a  text from my friend 
[01:31:30]  uh Robert Kelly we're  sure you know who he  is.  He played a ghost in  ghost town who  basically silently  follows you uh for  three days on the set  like as a ghost.  Uh do you remember  uh kind of a big fat  ghost who would try to  strike up conversations  with you awkwardly?  Yes yeah but it wasn't  awkwardly.  It wasn't awkwardly.  You're being polite.  You don't remember him.  You don't remember him.  Please please see we're  hoping that you would say  you don't remember him 
[01:32:00]  because it would it would  give us some uh some  great fodder for the  next 10 years.  I think I do and and of  course I've seen his  picture and his name  since because I check  IMDB every day to see  how many hits I got.  It's poor.  It's poor so if you  could if you could make  people go and see ghost  you know I'm joking  aside um I think ghost  town's a really nice  film and um I hope  people go and see it.  I mean there's no you  know it hasn't got it  hasn't got you know Tom  Cruise in it or any of  it but um it's it's a  really lovely film.  I think David Kept did a 
[01:32:30]  great job and it's  really funny and there's  some there's some old  fashioned about it.  It's sort of like one  of those um I don't  know it's a life type  films.  It's it's really it's  funny as well I mean and  there's lots of ad  libbing and it's really  funny film but it's it's  it's a grown-up film as  well.  Well Ricky we're going to  do you the biggest favor  because we love you.  Thank you.  We have Roland in  studio.  He saw the film.  Yeah.  So he's going to tell  everyone what he liked  about ghost town.  This is a treat Ricky.  This is a treat.  We don't do that do this 
[01:33:00]  often.  Roland.  It's like my own  personal review.  Brilliant.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Roland.  Ghost town.  Um well ghost town  stars um Ricky Gervais,  Greg Kinnear,  and Teglione.  Ricky Hallett, Ricky Gervais.  Ricky Gervais.  Would you stop the S and  get silent?  Don't don't heckle.  Listen I'm assuming this is  going to be a great review.  This is going to be an  amazing review.  It will be.  Screwed up program if you  got me on to say he was  poor he did his usual one  trick pony.  No.  The hair hadn't changed.  No no no.  You're great.  He looked short and fat and  it really showed up.  Roland. 
[01:33:30]  I'm assuming this is going  to be a great review so  don't heckle.  Yes we got a guy that saw  the movie already.  It doesn't get any better  than this.  Sell ghost town for  Ricky Gervais there  roll.  It's a sort of a romantic  comedy but it's like  literally it's one to me  right now it's my favorite  movie of the year.  Seriously.  It's funny it has like the  romantic comedy elements  but it's like a classic  movie like a classic  romantic comedy where  you're like finally there's  a great movie.  I love that.  I love that.  That's brilliant.  That's one of the nicest  things anyone's ever said.  Wow. 
[01:34:00]  And it has a good twist  though with the different  things with the ghost and  everything and it's a  really good story and had  a great ending too.  Oh what's the ending?  I'm not saying.  I will not say because  I love the movie so much  I want everybody to go  see it.  It's one of the best  movies out there.  Did you see Roland?  I actually got a  I apologize.  A construction worker  Bob Kelly played  and Bob as stupid as he  is Ricky we know  nobody but idiots.  It was a pleaser  working with him.  That's what I just got  texted.  A pleaser.  A pleaser.  Robert Kelly said it  was a pleaser working 
[01:34:30]  with you there Ricky.  That's great and it was  a pleasure working with  him.  He has no idea.  Well listen I know it  was a pleasure working  with him because it was  a pleasure working with  everyone.  Ah see.  Ricky's an old guy.  Yeah of course.  Dramatic aren't you?  Well Greg Kinnear's a  good actor.  I like Greg Kinnear.  He's in everything man.  Yeah he really is.  He's really good.  Yeah Ricky of course  you're calling because  we're all excited here in  New York and I guess  Los Angeles as well we  should promote that.  We're heard in L.A.  You're doing your  stand up. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah I'm doing a few  dates.  I start off with a couple  of warm up dates and the  theater.  How about we do this for  you?  July 11th and 12th at the  Kodak Theater in Los  Angeles and then you come  to New York to the  Wamuu Theater at  Madison Square Garden  July 14th, 15th and  16th.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  Get the tickets.  You can also go to  Ticketmaster or you can  go to RickyGervais.com.  Roland left off the S 
[01:35:30]  but it's G-E-R-V-A-I-S.  And in L.A.  Another guy on the  bill is called Ahmed  Ahmed.  He's a really good  stand up and in  Madison Square Garden  the support act is  Louis C.K.  Who I think is at the  risk of putting myself  down the best stand  up in America.  I think he's amazing.  We certainly take  issue with that but  Louis is a great comic.  How is he as an  actor?  Do you know what?  He said he was  nervous about it and  he thought how am I 
[01:36:00]  going to be another  comedian on a film  goofing about?  Yeah.  But I really think he's  going to be the surprise  breakout star of this  film because he's so  charismatic.  He didn't just go in  there and try and be  himself.  He even shaved off his  goatee.  He plays a really dim  sort of lunk of a guy  who's sort of like out  of control and he's the  only person in the film  who's a bigger loser  than me.  You do real...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  He's absolutely great.  You know what I mean?  Well, you know, he's 
[01:36:30]  really charismatic and  sweet and he's got a lot  of heart and it's a very  very funny...  I mean, I think he's  brilliant.  I can't get enough of  Louis.  I just did...  I mean, I blog about him  all the time.  I just put a video on my  blog of Louis.  I took him on the private  jet.  They gave us a private jet  we were filming, right, in  Lowell.  But I went to New York  weekend and I took Louis on  it.  On the way there, he  forgot his keys.  He forgot...  I mean, it's an absolute  catastrophe.  He was late.  He lost his bag.  He left a thing in the 
[01:37:00]  airport.  I mean, he's 40 years old  and on the way back, it  was turbulent and he was  so scared, right?  He was sweating.  He looked like a big ginger  testicle.  Just dripping, right?  And because he was scared,  he was shouting obscenities  and it was one of the  funny, I was scared, but  you know when you're  nervous, you think, well,  if I'm going to die, this  is all right, because  there's a man who's more  scared than me and he's  going to die saying  something like, shove it  up your ass.  And it's so funny. 
[01:37:30]  The video's on  rickygevase.com and it's  just pure fear that  fuels these comments.  I heard the video.  I heard about that.  I heard the video's  good.  We'll link it on  onaradio.com.  You do realize he's an  awful human being, right?  What, Louis?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he is.  He pretends to be.  See, he's protecting that  from you because...  Well, he does our  radio show a lot and  he's just an awful  human being.  Well, he comes out  with some pretty  out there stuff, but  I assume it's the  name of exploratory  comedy.  You know what 
[01:38:00]  Louis's great gift  is, Louis, we love  Louis, is he's one of  the best storytellers.  Like, he's just one  of those guys that  is, he's inherently  interesting no matter  what he's talking  about, he can make it  funny and interesting  and I can't do that.  I totally, what he  does is, if he goes  to the shops for a  pint of milk, he'll  come back with a really  self-deprecating story  that happened to him  and it's the funniest  anecdote you've heard.  Yeah.  And it happened, he  went to a, I think  he went to a Celtics  game when he was  there and he said  they kept going to 
[01:38:30]  the crowd and putting  people on the  jumbotron.  There was a bloke  with green hair and  they go, whoa, I  laugh.  And then there was  like, you know, some  guy dressed up as a  clown, they put on a  jumbotron and people  go, laugh.  And he heard this  crowd go, whoa, and he  looked up and it was  him.  And he said, they just  went, whoa, like, look  at that guy, he didn't  even mean to be that  weird.  You know what makes me  happy too, Ricky?  I'm reading this thing 
[01:39:00]  where it says, you  were doing stand-up and  there's always one  critic that's going to  be a complete douche.  And this one guy gave  you a hard time, so you  were closing every set by  saying, I can't say it  on this side of the  show, but calling the  guy an ugly, a little  ugly, pug-faced C.  Wow, nice.  Yeah.  Well, do you know what?  When I first started  the business of, you  know, I was worried  about, I really feared  being famous because  the British press, you  know, are quite onto  it and they're very  snipey and personal  and they're, they're 
[01:39:30]  like, they're jealous,  they all want to be  celebrities themselves,  you know.  That's not all, I mean  5% of them, right?  And I feared them.  And then I thought,  well, hold on, I've got  as much a platform as  them.  I'm not going to stay  for it.  So if someone says  that with me, I'm going  to absolutely destroy  them.  And now I don't fear  it anymore.  I've got a better  platform than them  because these people  that, that, that  criticize you, and I'm  not having to go at  all critics, but when  it's someone who  watches telly for a  living and tells us  where we went wrong, 
[01:40:00]  I want to go, hold  on, I made a  program, you wrote  200 words.  You know what I  mean?  It's sort of like,  so now I do, I do  sort of fight back  now.  And because of that,  it doesn't hurt me  anymore.  I just think, oh  God, they're, they're  nothing.  You know, what, what  are they going to do  to me?  So it, you know, I  make comedy and stuff  for like-minded people.  I do it for people who  might like it.  And I don't care about  people that don't.  Did you hate the  criticism?  Because we all get  criticized.  Did you think it was  like, I don't know, I  didn't know what he  said, but was it 
[01:40:30]  legitimate criticism or  was he going out of his  way just to be a real  tool?  Well, he didn't like  the, I sort of, he  didn't like the Bible.  He's a, he's a, he's a  religious man himself.  And I do a thing where I  deconstruct the Bible.  I look at Genesis and  stuff, you know, in a  comedic way, I'm not, I  know, I'm not getting on  a high horse.  I'm not, you know, I'm  not preaching.  And, um, he said, uh,  he said, oh, deconstructing  the Bible.  Oh, that's too easy.  And I thought, well, it  shouldn't be.  If you believe all this 
[01:41:00]  stuff, then you should be  strong in your face.  People who are strong in  their face are worried  about jokes, about  religion.  They're not worried  about it.  And, um, I just think  he, um, I think he, he  gave it away that it was  personal.  You know, that, that's all.  That's why.  That's a great point.  Uh, I, I, I just  wrote this and I'm so  bummed I didn't see this  on a recent Saturday  Night Live, uh, hosted  by Steve Carell.  Ricky did a bit about  the origin of The  Office.  It was, uh, a show from  Japan.  They aired an over-the-top  Japanese version of The  Office.  That sounds hilarious.  It was funny.  At the end, Ricky is 
[01:41:30]  sitting in a director's  chair laughing.  He said, that's funny  because it's racist.  That was not live.  That wasn't, yeah, that  was not live.  Brilliant.  Which is nice.  Can I see that on  YouTube?  I would love, I don't  watch, uh, Saturday,  Saturday Night Live  as much as I used  to, so I'm kind of  bummed I missed that.  I think it is on  YouTube.  I think I even linked  to it on my website.  RickyGervais.com.  Yeah, thank you.  Good plug.  Hey, are they as  repulsive over there  about, like, race and  stuff here?  Because, like, you do  anything racial here,  and Americans are such  sissies about race.  Uh, over there I know 
[01:42:00]  there's, like, tension  with Muslims, but is, is  there as much racial,  like, tension over humor?  Um, uh, well, I don't  know, I mean, you know,  it's, obviously it's  everywhere, but, you  know, there's idiots  everywhere.  I think that, um, you  guys are more open about  everything.  I think that you, um, you  sort of, you know, vive la  difference more than we.  I think there's a fear here.  It's still a big taboo to  even, um, uh, bring up  issues of race in, in  comedy or whatever.  Whereas, you know, I  think that your comedians,  uh, are much more 
[01:42:30]  liberal about, you know,  you know that there's a  difference between making  jokes, um, uh, about race  and being racist.  Yeah.  And, um, and I think that  we're still a little bit  scared.  No, it's still, we're a  little bit scared to  offend, even though what  you might be doing, um,  you know, it isn't racist.  It, it, you know, it's,  it's just talking about  issues.  So I think that it's  probably, um, it's  slightly freer in America,  but, you know, I, I,  politically, I don't know  whether it's a bigger or  or lesser problem. 
[01:43:00]  Uh, I don't, I don't  see a lot of racism.  I'm a, I must say, I  never, I never really  have growing up here, but  I don't know that, you  know, you go into the,  some backwaters of  places and it's like  nothing's changed.  What's, what's  frustrating to us, uh, in  radio, they still don't  get that message that  we're just trying to make  jokes.  As soon as you say  something that's, uh,  you know, outrageous,  they think you're being  racist when you were,  when you were trying to  be funny.  To the point, uh, the  company we work for  now, we're not allowed  to do any Asian humor 
[01:43:30]  whatsoever.  What's, can't do the  voice, can't, we can't  even discuss it.  Yeah.  I can't even tell you  what we're not allowed  to do because they'll  just dump out.  Well, I'm intrigued now.  I'm intrigued as to what  Asian humor is, but, um,  is it like Jewish humor?  Yes, it's like, yeah,  just the stereotypical  Asian stuff that, you  know, you would see in  any comedy club and  people would enjoy it and  laugh.  What?  Just like they would if  you're being stereotypical  about blacks and  Puerto Ricans and  everybody else.  What Jackie Chan does,  the way Jackie Chan 
[01:44:00]  sells his films, like  that, to do any of that  is, uh, we get dumped  out of.  Yeah.  So what, so you're,  so what you're saying  is you're, you know, a  bunch of white guys  that are angry that you  can't be racist.  Right.  Or have racist humor.  What's the world coming  to if a bunch of white  guys can't get together  and broadcast hate?  Exactly.  Of course, we created this  damn thing that broadcast,  we, we bring sunshine.  It's the world, the  world's going to the  dogs.  Well, the SNL skit, we  would get fired for that.  Really? 
[01:44:30]  If we did that skit on  our radio show, we would  get fired.  There was a show here in  New York, JV and Elvis,  they did an Asian, uh, bit  and they were trying to be  funny and they are no  longer heard on radio.  This is the point, I  think.  And that's the point that  people have got to get  over.  It depends where the  comedy comes from.  Yes.  It can come from a good  or a bad place.  If it comes from a bad,  bad place, it's  disgusting and it's not  funny and people like  that won't survive in, in  our world.  But if it comes from a  good place, then it's  cool.  It's okay. 
[01:45:00]  You can make jokes about  everything as long as you  can justify it.  And I just think the  subject of race is no  scarier than the subject  of carpets or the subject  of art.  It's what you do with it.  Do you have a pen?  Um, I have a pen, yeah.  All right, write this  number down.  It's the corporate  lawyers.  You need to have a  discussion with them for  us.  Let me sort it out for  you.  Because it sounds so  logical, but we've, we've  had that discussion.  It goes nowhere.  Anyway, uh, moving on,  uh, GTA four, a lot of 
[01:45:30]  people, uh, ranting and  raving about, uh, what you  did for GTA four.  Oh, that was great fun.  Yeah, that was, that was  really, really good fun.  Um, they just got me in and  said, um, do some, um, do  stuff, go crazy.  Um, I went that, you know,  I'd love to do that.  And then, um, it took me  about half an hour to get  into the tightest lycra all  in one suit.  I mean, I look like something  from a man who fell to  earth.  It was ridiculous.  I haven't found it yet,  but, uh, they're saying you  did like six to eight minutes  of standup that you could  watch on the TV in the  apartment. 
[01:46:00]  That's right.  I think I did a radio, um,  show.  Um, I, uh, I did some  standup in a club that you  can go into the club and  see me do it.  And then I'm on the TV as  well.  Yeah.  And, uh, um, I, I,  someone said, oh, like they  got to my bit.  I met someone and I said,  oh, well, I got to your  bit.  I said, can you shoot me?  And he went, oh, I  haven't tried, which it  will be the first thing, um,  all my friends and everyone  else in England do.  Yeah.  The first thing they do  when I get that bit,  they say, I wonder if I  can shoot him in his fat  face.  Although the good thing 
[01:46:30]  is they made me a bit  thinner.  So I thank them for that.  I look pretty butch.  Nice.  Ricky Gervais.com has  crashed.  It crashed.  Yeah.  I think people want to  check out some of the  stuff you've been, uh,  turning everybody on to  today.  It'll come, it'll come  back up.  Hey, uh, the office, uh,  Jimmy turned me on to the  English office.  We've talked about this  when you came in studio,  probably my favorite sitcom  of all time.  Wow.  And it gets better the  more you watch it and  how brilliant that thing  is.  And I'm so bummed out.  It was only on what?  Two.  Twelve episodes. 
[01:47:00]  Twelve plus three  episodes.  I know.  Well, there's, there's  sort of a reason for  that.  Um, I'm, I'm lazy.  No, no, because we  sort of did everything  ourselves and it's, um,  when you sort of write  and, uh, direct it and  you're in it, it, it  takes a year to do six  and we, um, we didn't  want to farm out.  We didn't want to, um,  use other writers or  other producers.  Um, and, um, you  know, even though we  stopped, we said  everything we had to  say, it still sort of  lives on.  I mean, the office, the 
[01:47:30]  American office is on  a hundred episodes.  It's shown in like, it's  still shown in its  original form and, and  all over the world and  there's loads of  remakes.  So, um, we sort of did  our bit and, um, and  that's it really.  And I, and I don't want  to do something just  because it's working.  I don't want to milk it  because you do want to  do other things, you  know, but, uh, um, I  am, and I've, I'm, I'm  very proud of it as  well.  Why haven't you been on  the American office?  Are you open to the  possibility of maybe doing  a cameo or, or some kind  of flip?  I think all of a sudden  they do some kind of  flip and there you are 
[01:48:00]  would be just so much  fun for everybody that  are, that are fans of  the English office.  Well, I, I wanted it.  I wanted them to be  watching extras in one  episode and I wanted  Steve to corral to come  in and go, no, I don't  like this guy.  If they did an American  remake, I'd be perfect  for this.  You know, uh, we've  interviewed a lot of  celebrities and you  mentioned extras.  Um, my most embarrassing  moment ever, and I've  been doing this radio for  a long time, Ricky  Gervais comes in to  promote extras.  Oh God, that's right. 
[01:48:30]  And the whole time I'm  thinking that it's the  office extras.  Yeah, like outtakes.  Outtakes and stuff from  the English office.  And if you listen to  the Ricky Gervais  interview we did in  studio, it's so obvious.  I don't even know about  this show extras.  I'm thinking it's extras  from the office.  I got so uncomfortable.  I couldn't finally talk  about it.  My hair was standing up  on my arms and stuff.  I just wanted to 
[01:49:00]  disappear when you  finally politely said  it's, uh, you know,  it's a, it's a show  and HBO, uh, you  were just, you  couldn't have been  nicer.  I, you should have  really just, you know,  slammed me.  Isn't embarrassment a  wonderful thing?  And then I, and then  I ended up watching it  and, uh, God, another  great show by Ricky  Gervais.  Thank you very much.  Again, and another 12  episodes in a special.  I know, you're, you're  lazy, I'm thinking.  I think so.  I know, yeah, I get, I  get bored very quickly  and, um, I don't know, 
[01:49:30]  I think it's because  I've been let down  myself.  There's so many shows  that do, um, that  just go on, you know,  too, uh, too, for too  long and it, it, it  smacks of like, um,  success.  Yeah.  As opposed to, you  know, trying to achieve  something aesthetically  and, um, uh, I, um, I  do it because I enjoy  the process really, the  creative process.  Um, and that's the fun  for me.  But you can't deny  though that sometimes a  show goes on, like when  you get a happy days  and then it morphs 
[01:50:00]  into a Joni loves  Chachi.  I mean, it's just more  entertainment for your  buck.  I, uh, I, I was, um,  I was thinking about  happy days, uh, as I  do, I, I, I liked it  early and, um, obviously  it gave us the term  jumping the shark and  everyone knows that,  but, um, it was  actually towards the end  one of the strangest  shows ever to be made.  I mean, it was  genuinely, I mean,  interesting.  I mean, I think it's,  I think it's nearly as 
[01:50:30]  strange as different  strokes.  Um, but we can't talk  about that because  there was, um, people  of different colors.  That's right.  We're not allowed to  mention that.  Hey, do you remember  Dudley was almost put  in the, remember Dudley  was in the bathtub?  That was my favorite  episode when creepy  Mr. Carlson from WKRP  in Cincinnati was trying  to photograph sexy  little Dudley in the  tub.  Yes.  That was the, uh,  very special.  that's on YouTube.  That weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's incredible.  That is one of the  weirdest shows ever.  Yeah.  They started doing a lot  of very special episodes  in the eighties. 
[01:51:00]  That was a huge thing  to do.  And, uh, it would,  it would, you know,  tackle some of the  tough issues of the  day, like, uh, child  molestation and drug use.  It's incredible.  Why don't we do it again?  Right.  But just with us, we're  just all white living in  the same house and, um,  we just, there's, there's  no issues at all.  Yeah.  We just, we're happy,  successful.  Yeah.  That's all.  Wait, what, what were you  saying, uh, about, uh,  what was the weird,  happy days?  How did happy days get  weird for you? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, I saw one, um, when,  you know, James Randy,  this sort of, um, cynic and,  uh, uh, he's a guy who  says, uh, he's, he's put  up a million dollars for  anyone, um, who can prove  anything that's supernatural.  Wow.  And, um, he's, uh, he's  also, you know, a respected  magician.  Yeah.  And he was in one episode  and, uh, he was in the,  you know, the great, the  great Randy and he had to  get into a tub of water  and, um, uh, it was a big  show and he escapes.  He did, he does an 
[01:52:00]  escapology thing, right?  But they went, oh, can I,  can I have a drink of  water?  And someone goes,  here's a drink of water.  And he drank it and he  went, oh, that's neat  vodka, which is weird.  I don't know where they  got that from.  And he goes, I'm allergic  to alcohol.  And he went unconscious  and Fonzie goes, I'll do  it.  And he got into the  bar and escaped without  any training and they  were cheering.  He came out all wet.  And I was thinking it's  one of the strangest  things I've ever seen.  Yeah.  The hell?  I preferred his  homoerotic relationship  with Ralph Malf and  Potsy, like that, just  that kind of fruity 
[01:52:30]  domination he had over  them.  I thought he flirted  with, um, Mrs. C as  well.  Yes!  Yes.  He definitely did.  And then the poor old  guy didn't know what was  going on.  Yeah.  The thing about me with  the Fonz is that he was  clearly 42 years old and  hanging around with  school children.  And he used to say,  would you please come in  the toilet?  He asked me to come in  the toilet.  Yeah.  Which, um, again, you  know, was a, was a, was a,  was a bit weird.  You want to go, Mr.  Fonzarelli, you're really  too old to be hanging  around a school now. 
[01:53:00]  I know you've got a  motorbike, but no, you  could, you've got to stop  hanging around this  school.  And he never, uh, he was,  he was, everyone was  scared of him, but he  never punched anybody.  You never saw him fight.  No, he didn't need to.  No.  Cool.  Fighting's not cool,  sucker.  Oh, I've changed, I've  gone into the A-team now.  Yeah.  Talk about the A-team now  there's, there's, there's a  show.  That's great too, because  no one ever got killed in  that.  They were firing off all  kinds of weapons, but, uh,  the bad guy always crawled  out of the rolled over  Jeep or, uh, the shot up 
[01:53:30]  truck.  You notice that when there  was an explosion, you  could see the actor come  off a trampoline.  Yeah.  And land on his back.  Right.  It was just like the  perfect, the flipping  midair, and land on his  back.  Not one of them landed on  a spike.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um.  Dopey show.  I, uh, I, I almost, um,  I almost said this to  Ricky Gervais, and now I  have to say it, because I  think he would appreciate  it. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, Ricky, it was  rumored that you were up  for the role that went to  Jack, uh, uh, Gillen  Hall in Brokeback Mountain.  Jake Gillen Hall.  Uh, Jake.  Gillen Hall in Brokeback  Mountain.  See, that's the one sheet  for Mark Wahlberg, who's  coming up next.  Wow.  I almost, I almost, I  almost, I almost had  another bad moment with  Ricky Gervais.  I, I put the page over  thinking it's just another  like sheet of like bullet  points, you know, that we  could go to, and it would  have been, it would have  been a different film, 
[01:54:30]  wouldn't it?  Yeah, it would have been.  But how was it, seriously,  how was it being in Boogie  Nights?  Hey, we really want to see,  I'm really looking forward  to you.  I've never seen you do  stand-up, man, uh, especially  knowing that Louie's on the  show, too.  That's a great show.  Yeah.  And, uh, July 11, 12 in L.A.,  but, uh, here in New York,  uh, it's July 14th through  16th at the, uh, Wamuu  Theater at, uh, MSG, and the  tickets are on sale now at  Ticketmaster.  And everybody who's seen you  just said you're a great,  great stand-up, um, and 
[01:55:00]  RickyGervais.com.  I can't wait to go.  Can't wait to go.  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm, uh, oh, the pressure's  on now.  I'm going to rehearse.  Are you going to come?  I'm going to practice in the  mirror.  Are you going to come?  All my lines down.  With a hairbrush?  Perfect.  Hey, when these shows sell,  uh, sell out, you will still  come in and say hi to us,  right?  Yeah, and you're, and you're,  are you going to come along  to the show?  Definitely.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Brilliant.  Well, um, uh, I'll, um,  I'll lay on some canapes  and, um, a glass of champagne  for you.  I know we have to.  Actually, what time do you  go to bed?  I won't be off till about 10.  You'll probably have to leave 
[01:55:30]  halfway through, won't you?  No, I'll make it, uh, a late  night for you, Ricky.  Every once in a while, I'll  stay in.  I always ask this to breakfast  DJs.  What time do you go to bed?  Honestly, I go to bed around  9.30.  I just, I just need my sleep.  I can't, I can't do it.  Every once in a while, I'll  push it to 11.  Well, when I was, when I was  filming, I was just doing the  film, I go to bed at 9 o'clock  I just need sleep.  I agree, yeah.  Hey, uh, we do have to take  a break, but really fast.  Where are you at with your  podcast?  Because, uh, you know, you 
[01:56:00]  get rave reviews on those.  We've just done one special  one-off for, to launch a, uh,  a little, it's a bit of, um,  I shouldn't mention it.  It's an internet radio station.  Yeah.  Um, I would do, is that okay  to mention?  Yes, yes, yes.  Um, it's, you know, the NME,  the, um, the new musical  express, it's like, um, uh, um,  a new music paper.  Um, they just launched a radio  show and, um, we did a one-off  two-hour show with music  that's being played, uh, you  know, just go, it's, um, if  you go to rickygervace.com,  there's a link to it there  at the NME radio, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  And are you going to do it  on a regular basis again?  Um, well, we might do sort  of like another series of  six, but, um, because I want  it to be regular, uh, I don't  want to let people down, so  it's, it's hard to find that  six-week period where I'm not  popping back and forth.  It's, it's the same as  having a cat, you know, you  can't just, I need someone  to, to look at, it doesn't,  analogy doesn't work at all.  It's nothing like having a  cat.  I, I was just running out  of words.  That's why I'm not going to  do radio.  It's too bad, though, because 
[01:57:00]  you, you hit the Guinness  Book of World Records for  most downloaded podcasts.  Wow.  Yeah.  8 million downloads.  8 million downloads.  Well, it's gone up now.  It's, um, it's, it's 22 of  the free ones and about 2  million of the paid podcasts.  So, I think that, I think,  do you know what I think it  is, I think that it's  actually the growth of the  iPod.  I think it keeps going up  because as people get an  iPod, they look for things  to, to download.  That's true.  So, it's still growing.  Isn't the iPod just one of  the best inventions of the 
[01:57:30]  decade?  It's, it's incredible.  Right.  I, I love it.  I mean, I, I'm not allowed  to advertise, am I?  Yeah.  So, I must mention race,  podcasts, or, oh, I've, I've,  oh, I've got into trouble  again.  That, that, that, I won't  mention Condoleezza Rice and  the Queen, either.  Thank you.  You know, it's funny,  when you come in, we're  going to go over songs we  work out to on our iPods  because I have such a  weird song.  Oh, I bet, eclectic Jim.  I bet you, what do you,  I, I, okay, I, I have got  the Rocky soundtrack on my  iPod. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, that's, that's pretty  bad.  That's, that's not that  bad, though.  That's horrendous.  You could get a lot worse  than that.  How?  Well, I said, well, yeah,  but if I tell you, sometimes  I work out to it.  That's, I, well, you know  what, growing up in high  school, my friend Frank was a  Sylvester Stallone  fanatic, he would take  Polaroids of the TV when  Rocky 3 was on, and he'd  paste them in his, his  apartment, his house, his  parents' house, and he  would work out to the  Rocky theme music as  well.  Wow, that's great.  That's lovely.  Yeah, he was, he was  13.  Yeah.  So it was kind of  understandable. 
[01:58:30]  Ricky, it's always a  pleasure.  Hopefully.  An absolute pleasure.  That was, that was  great, and thank you so  much for, um, giving me  all those plug.  I'm mildly embarrassed, but,  um, but, but keep it  up.  No, we think you're, uh,  just amazing.  I was going to say  terrific, but amazing is  the word.  RickyGervais.com.  Thank you, Ricky.  Thank you very much, guys,  and I'll see you next  time.  Sounds great.  Thank you, sir.  Cheers, man.  See ya.  Ricky Gervais, we've got to  take a quick break and, uh,  get ready for Mark  Wahlberg.  Mark Wahlberg.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:59:00]  Ricky Gervais was a lot  of fun.  Always is.  We love when he comes in  studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony  show.  Uh, Mark Wahlberg should  be calling in at any  moment.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Da, da, da, da, da.  Hardcore.  Killer tomatoes.  Film at 11.  Yeah, I gotta watch out for  those tomatoes.  What's up with the 
[01:59:30]  tomatoes?  I don't know.  People getting some of that  there is salmonella.  McDonald's, Burger King, and  just about every other  major fast food chain are  holding the tomatoes.  A salmonella outbreak linked  to raw tomatoes has been  spreading across the country  since mid-April, and now  with at least 145 people  reported sick and about two  dozen of them requiring  hospitalization, many  supermarkets and restaurants  nationwide are pulling the  tomatoes.  Well, if it's gonna save  lives, then, hey, take it 
[02:00:00]  off the market.  Take it off the market.  They're gonna save lives  in hay.  Yeah.  Take it off the market.  We got an awful analogy.  The Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention says  three kinds of new tomatoes  are affected.  Round red, red plum, and  red roma.  But what they don't know is  where the infected tomatoes  are grown.  What the FDA do instead,  by announcing the places  that the tomatoes are not  from, is essentially,  they're looking for a needle  in a haystack, but instead 
[02:00:30]  of holding up the needle,  they're holding up all the  hay and saying, this is not  the needle.  Ah, brilliant.  Exactly.  What?  Ah, that was precisely what  I was, what are you  talking about?  It's like looking for a  needle in a haystack, but  instead of picking up the  needle, you pick up the  hay and go, what?  But no one could pick up  that much hay at this.  But what do you do?  At one time.  You go, hay.  Hay to the hay. 
[02:01:00]  I don't get her analogy.  It's stupid.  It is stupid.  Basically, like what  happens, like most of us  do, when you see a pile of  hay, your instinct is to  scoop it up and just hold  it.  Uh-huh.  So you're photographed.  Because mother wouldn't  hold you as a kid.  What was she talking about?  You hold the hay.  You hold the hay.  Because you didn't get  the loving.  But what was she talking  about?  Ew.  I totally forgot what the  story was.  What's that?  Hay fever?  Oh, come on.  Did he just say hay fever?  As I was going to scold 
[02:01:30]  him, I just caught that.  They're spelled differently.  We're going to have to  send you back to the  morning zoo.  That was actually bad.  That was fine.  Hey, the iPhone.  Where are we at with  the iPhone?  You guys were saying the  iPhone was coming out  yesterday.  No, Bob Kelly was saying  that.  Yeah, they took the  website.  Shut up.  They were just unveiling  what the new iPhone is  going to be all about?  Yeah, they had another  one of these rah-rah  meat.  I don't even know where  these are held.  I don't know who the  people are that attend  these things, but Steve 
[02:02:00]  Jobs gets up there, and  apparently people are very  concerned with his  appearance.  What do you mean?  He's very skinny.  Uh-oh.  He's very, very skinny.  But that's another story.  And he gets up there, and  he unveils things, and  people go crazy in the  audience.  They hoop and holler like  there's a stripper on that  stage.  And he just says things  like, and the iPhone will  retail for, and they show  the old one with $399, and 
[02:02:30]  then it instantly goes to the  new one, and it says $199.  And the whole place goes,  yeah!  Yeah!  Who?  Who are these people?  Going back to the thin Steve  Jobs, you think God is  striking him down for not  allowing competition?  Um, striking him down for  not letting me text photos.  Or did he invent the water 
[02:03:00]  car, and the government's  getting it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They hit him with some  poison.  Wow, he does look really  thin.  Yeah.  So what is this new iPhone  going to do?  Everything the old one does.  But faster and better?  No.  It's just going to do  everything the old one does.  It's going to be thinner.  That's all.  It's no.  You think people clapping  were the ones that spent  $1,800 on the first one?  They're like, oh, great.  Now our friends will get  it for $200.  Don't we suck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's for the one  with the small hard drive  in it.  You don't want that.  The small memory.  We've got to interrupt  this amazing conversation 
[02:03:30]  on the iPhone because we  got a Hollywood star on  the line.  Mark Wahlberg.  How are you, Mark?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Welcome back to the  O.P. and Anthony  Show.  How are you?  How are you?  Good.  You got an iPhone?  No.  What's your phone of  choice?  I got a NexTone.  I don't even have a  text message, man.  I got to get my crap  together because kids are  going to be on the  computers any time now  and I'm way behind.  Wait, you text?  You can't even text?  No.  We can't talk to you.  I'm old-fashioned. 
[02:04:00]  I like to be, you know,  what if I just text it in  the interview?  You know, I like to talk  and communicate with  people.  He doesn't need to text.  He doesn't need to.  Mark Wahlberg, what he  does is point at his  groin and women get the  message.  Have you seen your own  bank account?  I mean, you really  should upgrade your  phone.  He doesn't need it, man.  I'm telling you.  Like a lot of guys,  Bill Clinton said at one  point he sent two emails  during his presence.  You just don't need to  to communicate.  I got five guys around  me with freaking  laptops and everything  else.  So you're not a tech 
[02:04:30]  guy, obviously.  No, not at all.  What's the techiest  thing you own?  Television with a  multi-purpose remote.  Is it a flat screen,  at least?  Yeah, I got one.  Okay.  Big old tube television.  Yeah.  Hey, we were talking  before.  Ope raised a good  question because he  asked the wrong guest.  But he confused you  and Ricky Gervais, which  has never happened  before or won't ever  probably again.  Well, they look very 
[02:05:00]  similar, Jimmy.  I mean, come on.  No, I was reading the  wrong prep sheet and I  asked Ricky Gervais, is  it true that he almost  had the role that went  to Jake Gyllenhaal in  Brokeback Mountain.  And Ricky Gervais was a  bit, no, he wasn't  confused because I told  him that I made the  mistake.  But you almost had that  role?  No.  You know, he called me and  asked me if I would meet  with Ang Lee, the woman  who actually was casting  the movie, the casting  director. 
[02:05:30]  She cast me in the  Basketball Diaries.  Right.  So she thought that, you  know, Ang would like me and  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I got the script and I only  read a few pages of it.  I wanted to wait to see  what Ang's take was.  And, you know, he wasn't  interested in hiring me.  He wanted to hire somebody  else.  So what happened, Mark?  You read the script and as  soon as the guy spit in his  hand, you put it down?  It was pretty crazy.  Yeah.  The tense scene.  I also did that with  Boogie Nights, you know,  when I read the first couple  of pages and the guy was  whipping his back around.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  So that did bother you or  it didn't in Boogie Nights?  You didn't care, right?  You know, again, I needed to  meet with the director and  see where his head was at  and what kind of movie he  was trying to make.  Remember, Showgirls had  just come out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to do another one of  those.  You're in the new M.  Night, how do you say  Shyamalan?  Shyamalan film, The  Happening.  Yeah.  And that looks so  goddamn cool.  Really?  And mysterious.  It's so scary.  I have no idea.  Really sick things to  people in that movie. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I have no idea what's  going on in the trailer,  which I like.  I hate when a trailer  gives away too much.  And this one gives away  nothing.  And I want to go see  this movie.  It's awesome, man.  I just saw it the other  day and I was scared.  I was scared.  He scared the crap out of  me.  And like I said, I'm in  90% of the movie and I  know what's going to  happen.  So I thought I was cool.  But he's just one of  those twisted guys.  Yeah, apparently so.  Is he easy to work with?  Because he looks like it  might be a little  difficult.  He's demanding. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, is he?  But the end result is  very gratifying.  Yeah.  Yeah, he can be.  I used to call him  Saddam sometimes.  You know.  He would literally, if  anybody had an idea,  he would just tell him  to shut up or put it  in a suggestion box.  But when you're working  with a guy like that,  at least you know he's  got a vision.  You trust him.  You know, if it works  out great, if it doesn't,  you know, it's really on  him.  Yeah.  Wow, so he was really  like, he got kind of  very pissed off if people  tried to suggest something  in the scene?  Well, he wouldn't be  pissed off.  You know, we went through  the rehearsal process, 
[02:07:30]  but he has the whole  movie in his head.  You know, so he just  basically wants everybody  else to do their job and  let him kind of handle  the big picture.  Well, a guy like that,  like you were on  I Heart Huckabee,  you were in that.  And I mean, David  Russell and Lily  Tomlin's fights, I  mean, how awkward was  that to be around?  It was, you know,  once it started, I just  go to my trail, I know  I have a good two hours  to take a nap.  Damn.  They know each other  really well, so they  were always kind of  going at it.  Hey, only in New York,  I'm looking at a  billboard for The 
[02:08:00]  Happening, Friday the  13th, it comes out  June 13th, M. Night  Shyamalan, and someone  whited out the H, the A,  the P.  Yeah, it just says  the penis.  Yeah, okay.  The penis.  There's more people in  the seat.  That's hilarious.  Sorry, we're just  juvenile on this show.  We can't help it.  Thank God, at least  I have some fun.  Yeah.  So it was actually  awkward to be around  those two fighting,  because I kind of am  attracted to that type 
[02:08:30]  of a scenario, where  it's just great to watch  people hating each other's  guts.  Oh, God, she went  nuts on everybody.  I was in the car once,  and she went nuts on  everybody.  Oh, was it really her  fault?  Was she the one that  started the whole thing?  Well, she was getting  upset, and then Dustin  Hoffman turned to her  and was like, just use it  in the scene.  She goes, F-U-L.  Yeah.  And then Naomi Watts  kind of cracked up.  She didn't want to,  but a little came out.  She was like, F-U-L.  And then she turned  around and she goes, F-U-L.  And then Dustin and  everybody looked at her  and she goes, how come  he didn't say F-U to  Mark?  He's scared he's going  to punch you in the  face. 
[02:09:00]  Why would she tell  Dustin Hoffman that?  Are they friends and  she was comfortable, or  is she just that much  of a psychopath?  Well, she was pretty  upset at that point.  He was being a wise-ass.  He was telling him to  use it as motivation.  All right, he was  talking to her like she  was this journeyman  actor and she's been  there for 50 years.  So, Mark, that was a  real thing that was  going on because it's  been kind of rumored  over the years that  they might have done  that just to kind of  promote the film and  this and that, but it  was the real thing,  huh?  No, no, no.  We love playing the  audio.  It's great. 
[02:09:30]  They definitely went  at it for a little  while and then it was  over and right back to  work.  You ever have  somebody you wanted to  strangle that you were  working with, director or  whatever, or one of the  producers that you  really, really had  problems with?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Roland's cringing over  there.  Was that a bad question?  No, no, no.  Is it going to take us  to a good place?  No.  So, finally, what was  the end result?  Well, I had to run  around Paris looking  like a goofball with  a beret and a scarf  on and a bag with  a baguette and the 
[02:10:00]  director was dressed  the same way.  Wait, you were  fighting for that or  against it?  Against.  Of course he was  fighting against it.  Against.  But, you know, when  you're working with a  guy who's, you know,  Academy Award winning  director and just that  and the other, you  know, you have a  little bit of faith.  What film is that?  The Truth About  Charlie.  Oh, okay.  I never saw that.  No.  Yeah, good.  Good.  Oh, you're not  calling in to promote  that as well?  No.  Do you ever fake how  good a movie is when  you're doing interviews? 
[02:10:30]  Well, it's nice when  you're really proud of  a movie and you don't  have to actually lie.  Right.  And, you know, I've  been very fortunate.  I just started making  decisions based on my  own selfish reasons.  You know, I want to  make a good movie.  I want to play a good  part.  Early on, it was about  the director and the  filmmaker and I would  take risks even if I  didn't necessarily love  the material.  But now I'm not doing  that anymore.  It's going to be good.  You ever see, who's  Madsen?  Michael Madsen, man.  He's been very honest  about his films.  On his website, he kind  of goes over them and  he rates them and he  explains why he did it,  like whether it was a  boat payment or something 
[02:11:00]  like that.  Like he just bashes films  that he was in that were  awful, some he never saw.  I mean, it's nice to have  that kind of honesty from  an actor.  Yeah, he admits like he  did one movie to pay his  mortgage, one movie because  he owed somebody a favor.  It's all on his website.  It's some great reading if  you've never gone there.  No, I've seen that.  Yeah, The Happening, now  this is one of those  movies that you really  should go see right away  because I hear there's a  fine ending and a twist  and all that and you  don't want someone  telling you, you want to 
[02:11:30]  see it for yourself,  right?  You don't want people  telling you what it's  about, but it's not  necessarily a twist.  Okay.  It's, you know, nice,  really, you know, he  went on to say that he  never really had any  twists in any of his  movies.  Oh, no, of course not.  But, uh...  He told us a guy was  dead who we were  watching for an hour and  40 minutes.  That was a big twist.  That was a good one.  That was probably...  I was sitting in a  press conference with  him yesterday and he  said, my movies don't  have twists.  What is he?  He's got to be smoking  dope or something.  Is anybody just...  People are afraid to  call him out because of 
[02:12:00]  who he is.  Like, just go, shut up.  They all have twists.  Yeah.  There's always something  weird happening.  In that movie, I didn't  even like the movie.  What was the movie with  Joaquin Phoenix?  The Village?  The Village.  Yeah, it turns out  they're like, you know,  1988 somewhere in  California and you're  supposed to think it's  like in the 1400s.  That was a little bit  of a twist.  Yeah, big twist.  I didn't see that one.  Yeah, you missed  nothing.  I didn't like it.  It was...  I gotta be...  I gotta be fair to  myself.  It was alright.  The concept was amazing.  I don't think he  completely pulled it  off, unfortunately.  Yeah, it was a little 
[02:12:30]  bit weird, but...  He's a pretty amazingly  talented guy, though.  Absolutely.  I mean, take a couple  people, you write a  script, take a couple  people in the woods  with the camera and  then come up with  that.  Yeah.  I'd like to be able  to do that.  I gotta ask you  about your bro.  New kids getting  back together?  Are they?  Why?  I don't know.  I'm seeing that the  new kids on the  block are doing a  reunion.  Awesome. 
[02:13:00]  You are such a  smartass, man.  Awesome.  I mean, I love  the new guy.  I'm there.  You're there for  that one.  I'm right there.  I'm coming back,  too.  Did your brother  kind of look at  that those days  and go, like,  ugh?  You know, I asked  him what he was  doing, what he was  thinking, and he's  got a really great  idea, and he's one  of those talented  guys that I know,  so I think he  could pull it off.  He's got a very 
[02:13:30]  decent acting career  going for himself.  Yeah, those other  guys must have  begged him into  doing it.  Yeah, must have.  I mean, I'm  looking at the  page here, the  new kids on the  block webpage, and  they're all just  kind of, you know,  hanging out.  Obviously, they're a  little older and  might look a little  silly singing some  of those songs, but  I mean, I guess  there's money behind  it.  Yeah, of course.  Well, they've got to  be doing something  now.  They've got to be able  to make some money  out there.  Yeah.  You came from a  really bad place, 
[02:14:00]  Mark, growing up.  I mean, you  really, you had  some, I don't  mean the  neighborhood, but  you had some  real problems with  the law and stuff  like that.  What finally  straightened you  out?  It's very  interesting, the  fact that you've  been involved in  some really rough  stuff.  Well, I didn't  like jail, that's  for sure.  I like my freedom.  I like to go to  bed when I want,  come and go as I  please, eat what I  want.  So that was pretty  much a wake-up call.  And then, of course,  after getting out, you  have to be able to be  in the neighborhood  and, you know, if  you're not being one  of the guys, then  you're a pussy and a 
[02:14:30]  punk.  Right.  So I had to deal  with all that, but  you know, it's all  good.  Was there an actual  moment, though, where  you said, all right,  enough, enough with  this?  Well, yeah, I woke  up and I didn't  really remember what  had happened the  night before and I  was being held on  $100,000 cash bail.  Some guy was in the  hospital and, you  know, I wasn't going  home anytime soon.  So I realized that I  needed to get my  act together.  Damn.  Well, you were on  what, PCP?  It was obviously, it  was smoking a little  dust and drinking and,  you know, trying to  rob some guy and got 
[02:15:00]  ugly.  Man, you went from  that to just a huge  star with entourage and  everything else.  I mean, well, I mean,  yeah, it started with  music and then from  music, you segue into  this great film career.  I mean, do you still  party at all or no?  Nah.  Nah.  You know, I'll have a  glass of wine here or  there, but that's about  it.  You know, I wanted to  stop coming out to  clubs, too.  The great thing about  it is now, you know,  if I get up in the  morning, I'll be able to  work out, go work from  8 to 12 hours, come  home, have a nice  dinner, read a little  bit, go to bed and  still get 8 hours. 
[02:15:30]  You had those abs when  you were smoking angel  dust?  I got it.  I'm going to go get  some today.  Might not.  Might not be the way  to do it.  I'm just effing with  you, man.  No, I'm fine.  Give it a shot.  We have to go,  unfortunately.  We have a  9 o'clock.  But, Mark, I appreciate  it.  If you're ever in New  York, we'd love to have  you stop by.  Just do the hang.  I come in for Max  Payne.  If you guys go see the  movie, I'll come in and  talk about it.  Hell yeah, we will.  I love the game.  Awesome.  Oh, man. 
[02:16:00]  You're excited about  that one?  Oh, man.  It's crazy.  When does that come  out, Ron?  The game is fantastic.  You don't know?  I love it.  When the Matrix came  out, it was special.  Wait until you see  this thing, man.  When is that coming  out?  October or Thanksgiving.  Oh, cool.  We'll see you in the  fall, man.  Yeah.  No, it's sick.  I just saw like 10  minutes of it cut  together there.  I'm sending it out to  everybody.  Very nice.  Nice.  No CGI.  They try to kill me,  but it's awesome.  The happening, Mark's  new movie comes out,  M. Night Shyamalan  movie comes out this 
[02:16:30]  Friday, June 13th.  Obviously, everything  you touch is really  successful, man, so I'm  sure this will be the  same.  Good luck to you,  okay?  Thanks, guys.  God bless.  Thank you, Mark.  Mark Wahlberg, everyone,  as we head out the door  and head over to XM  Satellite Radio.  You guys have a good  day.  XM 202.  In the world of Radio 
[02:17:00]  Shock Jocks, the biggest  are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking  things that border on  offensive in order to  entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and  think that radio has to be  nice.  Why?  Why does radio out of any  other medium have to be  nice?  We are being now held  to a standard where we  have to be nice and make  people feel good.  Go screwed.  Radio bad boys, Opie and  Anthony.  Controversial radio  personalities, Opie and  Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and  Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts,  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and  Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Hold on.  Oh, yeah!  This is where entertainment is going.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems? 
[02:18:00]  Oh, it would be an Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off  so that bag shows through where icing was.  Oh!  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It might be the heat, but we're going to do a little more bitching.  I'm sorry, but we have to. 
[02:18:30]  The bitching is way down on the Opie and Anthony show.  I think most people would acknowledge that.  But, you know, fuck Washington and their fuckholes.  What's the latest?  And they're getting annoyed at us?  We did this animation festival,  and it came off great.  It came off so well that we're not going to wait a year.  We're going to do another one sooner than later,  probably Boston, probably in October.  But the emails going back and forth last night,  yelling and screaming, you know,  they were trying to blame our guys, 
[02:19:00]  and we're definitely blaming them down in Washington  that they didn't get the lawyers to look at these animations ahead of time.  So on Monday, when we did our first live show after the animation festival,  we would be able to, you know, direct traffic to one central location,  which is great for the radio show.  And now, what day are we up to?  I don't even know.  Tuesday?  Tuesday.  So that's five days after the animation festival, believe it or not.  And we still don't have a central location to direct traffic, 
[02:19:30]  because there's a lot of listeners,  probably still 99% of the listeners have not seen the animations.  And you might be thinking, no way.  I'm telling you, yes, that's how the numbers work out.  And now I'm hearing that the lawyers have rejected some of the animations  that are supposed to go up on iTunes.  Right.  I'm trying to find out which ones.  I'm just...  Which animations have been rejected?  I'm trying to find out.  It's not Don.  It's not Don.  He might know.  He might know.  Get Don, get Eric Logan on the phone, 
[02:20:00]  and let's talk this through.  What are they doing?  This is satellite radio.  Stop with the censorship.  What the fuck are they rejecting?  I don't know.  This is satellite fucking radio.  I'm sending my prerequisite nagging emails.  I can't wait.  I cannot wait to hear which ones it is,  if it's one or more,  and then the dumb fucking reason why.  That's what I want to hear.  And if you're one of the animators out there,  you're hoping that your animation was rejected. 
[02:20:30]  Trust me.  Yeah, believe me.  It'll get more attention.  What out of...  I'm thinking...  I'm thinking the one with jail.  With, um...  Wesley Snipes.  Wesley Snipes.  Get the fuck out of here.  He said nigger, but it wasn't racist.  Because he said nigger in it.  Patrice was saying that.  I don't think that's one.  I bet it is.  What else could there possibly be?  And it was N-I-G-G-A.  I don't know.  Which the black community tells us is okay.  Oh, okay.  As long as you say it with the G-G-A.  Go on the street.  Let's see how long you could say that. 
[02:21:00]  No, no kidding.  No kidding.  I'm saying...  And you know what?  You guys make me laugh,  because you're looking at me going,  no, it can't be that.  You're right.  Look at who we're fucking talking about.  These dope-ass lawyers.  Dope-ass?  They're not good.  Oh, I didn't mean dope like that.  I meant dope like stupid.  Look, I understand most people in Washington  have pretty much given up.  I get it.  But we haven't up here in New York.  Because I heard another thing  that's a person or two  might be annoyed  because they're getting too much emails on this.  Tough shit. 
[02:21:30]  You're fucking bad.  Sorry.  This is really, really good  for the Opie and Anthony show,  and we're going to push, push, push  until we get our way.  What animations were rejected?  I gotta know.  I have to know,  because I will laugh.  Can we call Logan?  I have to laugh.  All right, you say the Wesley Snipes one.  That's what I'm going to say.  But they're saying a few of them.  Steve, which ones?  He's trying to find out.  And why doesn't anyone answer their phone  when we're on the air?  They all answer their phones right away 
[02:22:00]  when the show's over.  Go fuck yourself.  We do everything on the air.  Don, we want to talk to you right now.  Mr. Logan, we want to talk to you right now.  Elo's not in,  and his cell phone's dumping right into voicemails.  Of course.  Yeah, let me see.  Of course.  What?  What?  They're calling Don right now.  What animation?  Does anyone have a guess  which animation would be rejected  by the dopey lawyers?  Don's in a meeting.  Even though this is satellite radio.  So what are you in a meeting?  So what?  Fuck the meeting.  This is way more important  than some dumb meeting.  Why can't he fucking come out of a meeting? 
[02:22:30]  It's a fucking on-air thing.  I'd love to know.  Oh, my God.  I want to know.  Holy shit.  Someone's suggesting the animation  where the clit gets cut off  and the chicken picks it up.  I love that part.  That's hilarious.  Hysterical.  Nice clit.  The only...  Bobby,  bouncing on the ground.  Racist stuff would probably get done.  Of course, racist.  Of course.  So maybe Anthony's right,  but is there any other racist animations?  I can't even...  I think maybe they're having a problem  with copyrighted material, 
[02:23:00]  like maybe songs being used.  I mean, that's the only thing I could think of.  Like, what song?  Oh, wow.  What song?  Well, I mean, maybe iTunes is having a problem  with Street Fighting Man being,  you know, the music in some of these.  I really don't know.  It's just a guess.  Oh, Danny.  Yeah.  Thanks for making it legitimate.  All right.  That's all I can think of.  You know what?  Let's see.  Let's see before we freak out.  Maybe it's not that.  Or there's a special interest group  that represents chickens  that have a big problem.  Maybe it's not that.  Something as stupid as the Warner Brothers music  being used in the beginning of the...  Oh, my God.  God. 
[02:23:30]  But iTunes may reject that.  Yeah, it could be an iTunes thing.  Yeah, but we don't even know.  Five days later, we don't even know.  This is stuff that should be figured out  way the fuck before we start promoting  the fact that it's going to be on iTunes.  You would think a lawyer or Don or Logan  would sit us down and go,  look, guys, this is some of the things  to look out for.  Copyright infringement, racist humor,  even though we don't agree with that.  We don't know shit  because they don't fucking work  down there anymore.  Stupid fucking lawyers.  Yuck.  Stupid fucking lawyers. 
[02:24:00]  What?  Danny was right.  Legal rejected most of the video review  due mostly to music usage.  Okay.  So we have a list of the ones that got...  I printed that out for you,  but I'll print that out again.  Of the ones that did get approved.  But it's not about content  or being too dirty?  No, it's not about content.  It's about copyrighted material.  We find out five days later.  Yeah, why weren't we told this before?  Yeah, we'll find something else  to be mad at.  So basically,  the best animations  aren't even going to be shown  on iTunes.  Can we get in touch with the animators  and have them remix their audio  to... 
[02:24:30]  It probably takes away  from some of the animations,  to be honest with you.  Ecstasy of Copper?  What are they going to do?  Oh, shit, yeah.  That's a whole fucking song.  All right, well, you know what?  You want to see them, basically,  you'll find them  and you've got to come  to the animation festival  the next time we do it.  I was just thinking  how funny it would be  if they put, like,  royalty-free piano music.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  It's a common usage.  Yeah, we should make, like,  Big A do the music  for the animations.  Just sit them  in front of a piano.  Big A, we can't use  the Warner Brothers song 
[02:25:00]  or Ecstasy of Gold,  so just improvise  for this animator.  Can you just talk  and we'll use  whatever you say  as Porky Pig at the end?  Yeah, yeah.  We got it, Jim.  So it's mostly  copyright infringement?  Mm-hmm.  And is Don finding this out  for the first time today?  That's not from Don.  That's from legal.  Don wasn't aware  that they got to...  Legal.  Stop taking your  four-hour fucking lunches  and help us out.  We're busting our balls  up here in New York.  Okay.  I'm going to say it right now.  My problem with them  is that they didn't tell us. 
[02:25:30]  That's something, look,  that's...  That's something that  seems like they would have  known a week ago.  Yep.  Not Tuesday,  as we're wondering  why we can't push people  to iTunes yet.  Fucking lawyers,  get the fuck out of radio  before it's too fucking late.  Yeah.  You're ruining everything  creative about radio.  Another email coming in.  Yes, Steve?  Oh, no.  This is the ones  that did get approved.  Oh.  Conflict resolution. 
[02:26:00]  Anthony eats with kids  or doesn't like eating with kids.  Elliot Spitzer,  Slaughterhouse,  and the ONA clown one,  which was not shown  at the...  Why didn't...  Because that one  sucked a dick.  What about Wesley Snipes?  Find that out.  All right.  Why not?  If Wesley Snipes was rejected,  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  Oh, they still have  six more to review  and I think the  Wesley Snipes one...  When the fuck  are they gonna review them?  They are, you know,  two hours long each,  so it does take a long time.  It's fucking...  Oh, no, that's right.  20 animations. 
[02:26:30]  It took us 45 minutes  at Roseland.  When the fuck  are they gonna review  all these animations,  these lazy fucks?  That Wesley Snipes one  has the Oz theme in it.  God damn it.  Why would you remember that?  I've seen all these animations  like 15 times.  Sam was the point guy  for a lot of this stuff.  Young Sam  with his big hair.  When are they gonna  review them, Steve?  The animation festival  is last Thursday. 
[02:27:00]  This is like fucking  Morse code.  And a lot of these animations  we had weeks  before the animation.  I know we got a lot,  a bunch of them  that came in last minute,  but why the fuck  aren't they doing their jobs?  I can only communicate  through email with people  because a lot of people  don't like to pick up  their phones  or a lot of people  are constantly in meetings.  Well, that's corporate lingo  for I don't want  to deal with this.  Yeah, we're not talking  to you.  Meetings?  Shut the fuck up.  What are you meeting about? 
[02:27:30]  Where are you gonna work next?  Maybe where we're gonna work.  We got options.  Fuck them.  Fuck them all.  God damn it.  You know what?  We'll just do a radio show  for XM.  That's it.  We won't do this extra shit  because if they don't give a shit,  why should we?  This should have been figured out.  It should have been  a well-oiled machine.  Animation festival.  You know,  we had all sorts  of other suggestions  that fell  through the cracks, 
[02:28:00]  but at the very least,  they should have had  this all figured out  before we did  our next live show  after the animation festival.  And you know what else you do?  You put things through  and you wait for a C&D  because the truth of the matter  is no one does anything.  They give you a C&D  and then you pull the shit.  Yeah.  But beforehand...  Well, that's why lawyers  are wrecking radio creatively  because they're playing  all this way too fucking safe.  Yeah.  Way too fucking safe.  Animationfest.net 
[02:28:30]  is back up  for the first 10 people  that go there.  Sorry, Steve,  but there was  a lot of complaints.  But you're saying  that it was a...  Dude, we...  That was a 100 megabyte  or 100 megabit pipe.  That's a huge amount  of bandwidth  and they gobbled it.  Is that big?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is.  It's a substantial amount  of bandwidth  and I think it's the fact  that we had,  what is it,  20 animations  or 25 animations  and you have  10,000 people at a time  trying to look at them.  You know how stupid XM is? 
[02:29:00]  They don't even have  the brains  to put all the animations  up on their fucking website  to get hits.  Bunch of dummies.  Because then our fans  would go,  hey, Charlie,  I know you don't got  satellite radio,  but I saw some good animations.  Go to XMRadio.com.  You'll see them for yourself.  Next thing you know,  Charlie might be subscribing  to the service.  Right.  But they can't even  do that shit right.  Wesley Snipes 1  getting reviewed today.  Oh, gee, thanks.  Thanks for doing us a favor.  Bless you.  Fuckers.  Bless you. 
[02:29:30]  Bless you.  Fuckers.  Fuckers.  Fuckers.  Jimmy, where are you at  with this?  Fuckers.  I'm annoyed with it,  but what are we going to do?  I mean, the reality is this.  It's such a fucking  weird time right now.  It's like,  it is what it is.  Fuck it.  There's nothing we can do about it.  They should have done it.  They're going to say  that they were caught up  in other stuff.  I guess they are.  No, they're not.  It's not a priority for them.  They are in the middle  of doing what they do.  We're not a priority,  so why don't you  at least admit that,  fuckers. 
[02:30:00]  Either way,  let's just do the show.  There's nothing else we can do.  This was a great event,  and they dropped the ball  on a bunch of things down there.  And I'm not going after Don.  Don did a fantastic job.  He really did.  But there were other elements  to this animation festival  that just didn't happen.  Didn't happen.  Including like a quick wristband  where all the animations,  what is it called?  The UBS?  USB, whatever fucking thing.  Yeah, we're going to have  like wristbands with that  because that's a new technology  that's starting to take off.  Hey, thanks for coming 
[02:30:30]  to the animation festival.  Here you go.  Here's all the animations  on a little wrist thing.  Yep.  You know?  That was one of a bunch  of suggestions  and none of them happened.  None of them.  Oh, Jesus.  McCain looks old.  Oh, he is.  Holy shit.  Look at this cheek.  Looks like he's got  a bunch of chaw.  Dude, you're...  Looks like he's  chawing a backy.  You are so looking  at the first black president.  I'm telling you.  I really am starting  to think...  It's a perfect storm. 
[02:31:00]  This might happen.  Look, when you get Obama,  he's a handsome black man.  I have no problem  saying that.  What is he?  Up against John McCain.  You're going to have  like a JFK-Richard Nixon  thing happening  when they're doing  their debates.  I mean, it's going to be  kissing that King Cole of you.  I'm telling you.  Yeah?  Help me, Henji.  I'm trying to elect  this brud.  So you find him attractive?  Look, dude.  It's...  There's nothing wrong  with that.  You can play...  He's a good-looking 
[02:31:30]  black guy, yes.  He's attractive.  Yeah, there's nothing  wrong with that.  I want to kiss him.  Yes, you're right.  That's what I want to do.  Cuddle.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  I don't know.  That wife of his  makes me nervous.  She scares the shit  out of me.  I'm with you on that.  Makes me nervous.  You kidding how great  she'll be for four years  getting quotes?  I can't wait to hear  Michelle Obama start yapping.  She fucking rules.  She'll be trashing  the white devil.  She's the fucking greatest.  Yeah.  We need that.  You don't want some  fucking dignified people 
[02:32:00]  in the White House  saying polite shit.  I want a fucking  loose cannon.  Yeah.  And the white man!  And they fucking  catch her on tape  and she's got to explain it.  I can't wait for that shit.  Oh, that'll be great.  Fucking McCain  and his boring blonde  fucking 18-year-old wife.  And tell your boy  McCain stops  to get out of the fucking sun.  It's 100 degrees.  Yeah, I know.  Stay in the shade.  What is he doing?  Look at him  walking with his  Terminator glasses.  Oh, it just doesn't...  Oh, my God.  Skin cancer is just  growing on him.  What do I have to do? 
[02:32:30]  Let's see.  All the money's got to  come out and go  into the mattress.  I've got to buy  as many guns as possible  before they outlaw  the guns.  Image is very important.  In the race war.  You watch.  You watch.  That's a biggie.  A biggie with people.  Do you honestly think...  A biggie.  And it is a serious subject  and I'm not even going to  say it because people  get in trouble like that.  But you know the Midwest  and the South?  You know their hatred  of people of the darker race? 
[02:33:00]  Right.  Do you think anybody  is going to try  to pull some shenanigans?  We haven't had any  shenanigan pullings  since like Reagan.  Reagan, yeah.  Do you think there's going  to be any shenanigan pullings?  I don't know.  I mean, he's got the biggest  Secret Service detail,  Obama.  Yeah.  Look, we all know  what they're afraid of.  They're afraid that someone  doesn't want a black president  is going to fucking...  is going to try  and take him out.  Right.  I don't think  that is going to...  His Secret Service detail 
[02:33:30]  is probably so good.  I mean, it's such  a prevalent thing.  Right.  If there's anything  history has taught us.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess so.  I mean, really,  think about it.  It doesn't matter.  It could happen.  And I would think...  He's well protected.  Especially if he chooses  a white vice president  that there are some real  lunatic fanatics  that would absolutely  want him out of the picture 
[02:34:00]  to put a white guy in there.  Yeah, but everyone's aware of that.  So you protect the...  Aware of it.  Everybody was aware.  Do you see how  Reagan got shot?  Yeah.  That was ridiculous.  He was surrounded by guys  with Uzis in their coats.  The guy was completely  surrounded by Secret Service.  You're not going to have...  And that guy snuck in there.  You're just not going  to have those moments  with Obama.  You're not going to have  that moment with Obama?  Nope.  You don't think Obama's  going to be giving speeches  like that in front of  the public somewhere?  You know what?  Some white supremacist 
[02:34:30]  who wants to start a race war  and wants to be a hero  for white supremacy?  Oh my God.  That's what I'm talking about.  Some real nutcase.  Some real fanatic.  Because they're...  You ever go to a few  of these white power  Aryan nation websites?  No.  Oh, you ought to go.  No.  You could use my password.  I'm kidding, of course.  No, you go to some  of these sites.  They are unbelievable.  They really, really are fanatics.  And they will, you know, 
[02:35:00]  they'll talk about  doing whatever it takes.  We'll see, but I don't see  how you can protect anybody  100% of the time.  I don't know.  That's crazy talk.  It's...  And it would start  a real big...  Oh boy, what a rift.  What a rift that would start  between the races.  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  I don't know.  Load up.  Whatever. 
[02:35:30]  It's going to be  an interesting campaign.  Campaign.  We obviously don't wish  that on Obama.  You got to make this crap  perfectly clear.  Oh, I know.  You get thrown off the air  because these animals  out there.  People think you're...  That blog for Breitbart.  Yeah.  Oh, the Opie and Anthony  show was talking about...  No.  No.  Shut up.  No.  Something that is  on people's minds.  That's all.  Yeah.  I think Obama  becomes the president  though.  I really do.  I think there's  a perfect storm. 
[02:36:00]  Perfect storm.  Yep.  What is up  with McCain's cheek  on the left side?  What is that about?  Some VC guy  was pounding it  with a rifle butt.  He had his head  caved in pretty much.  How's McCain...  He's been trying  to become president  for the last, what,  24 years or something?  Oh, for a while.  Yeah.  And he was always like...  No one took him seriously.  He dropped out early always.  He was just kind of like...  Yeah, how did he get the...  He was kind of that guy.  He was just one of the guys  you always saw  every time there was...  It was time for a new president.  Yeah.  He was like, 
[02:36:30]  all right, I'll give it  another shot.  Yeah, how'd that happen?  I don't know, right?  Am I right?  When was the first time  he attempted this?  I would guess 12 years ago.  Yeah, probably.  I would guess before...  Probably.  ...before Bush got in there.  All right.  First ran in 2000.  Just 2000?  2000, that's it?  And he didn't drop out early.  Okay.  Okay.  That's why I asked the question.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We played something 
[02:37:00]  on regular radio today.  It's worth another spin  because we get to hear  all the dirty words  here at XM.  No, spin.  Is this the bug guy?  Yeah, the bug guy  is hilarious.  Bug guy.  He's a black reporter  and man, is he black.  Are you allowed  to still say that?  I hope so.  He's a black reporter.  He's such a reporter  and he's so black.  In my humble opinion,  he sounds sort of white  when he's doing his reporting.  He's got the white sound. 
[02:37:30]  He's got that stereotypical  white newscaster voice  and a bug landed in his mouth  and he lost his motherfucking mind  and shit.  And then he went ghetto.  What are you writing, Jimmy?  Anything interesting?  Just jotting down  some thoughts for myself.  All right.  Ooh.  Here we go.  What really happened  on that Thursday  here at Augusta High School?  Now, I would guess  this is a white guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because then I was thinking  like when we played this earlier,  I'm thinking that  do I hear black in his voice? 
[02:38:00]  A little bit  when he said high school.  Are you even allowed  to say that?  Who the fuck knows?  When he said school,  it was a little  in the word school.  Really?  Yeah.  What really happened  on that Thursday  here at Augusta High School  that led to Chris Wood's death?  What the fuck is that?  What the hell?  That's the wrong one.  Oh, the beeps.  I'm sorry.  Here we go.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Jesus.  Opie.  And no, I will not be getting  a bare-bottom spanking.  Why not?  You made a mistake, Opie.  Oh, that wasn't suggested. 
[02:38:30]  Sounded like you wanted it.  What happened?  Especially with that huge  banana in front of you.  It might be more than  a bare-bottom spanking.  Well, we were walking  to XM and Kenny  was walking next to me.  I got probably  the biggest banana  you could buy.  That is a big,  curvy banana.  So Kenny's hand  is kind of like,  you know,  by my side  and I just kind of  pushed the banana  in his hand  without him knowing it.  Oh, he grabbed it  like a trooper.  Yeah.  Oh, boy,  did he gobble up  that banana. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, by the way,  stupid Kenny.  Kenny's been to my apartment  a million times, right?  Over the last year.  And he got something  for me yesterday  and he brought it  this morning, right?  Jimmy, you're going  to love this one.  I'm listening.  And all of a sudden  he texts me  that he's outside  in the hallway  with this thing  for the house.  No big deal, right?  So I write him back  and I go,  you're in the hallway  because I don't see you.  So I assume 
[02:39:30]  he meant the hallway  downstairs  so I go all the way down  and I live pretty high up.  I go downstairs  and the guy goes,  he's upstairs  in your hallway.  I'm like,  I was just there.  So I go,  Kenny, where are you?  He was on the floor  above me.  Just standing.  I'm waiting for you, G.H.  Just standing there.  What?  And thank you for laughing, Danny  because, I mean,  if you were at my place  maybe once,  you'd make that,  like, you'd be confused.  He's been there enough  where that is just 
[02:40:00]  a dumb move.  Yeah.  A dumb move.  All right,  here's the guy  unedited.  What really happened  on that Thursday  here at Augusta High School  that led to Chris Wood's death?  What the fuck is that?  Shit!  I'm dying  in this fucking country-ass,  fucked-up town.  Shit flying in my mouth.  The fuck?  I can't see  pilot.  Let's get the fuck  out of this country,  motherfucker. 
[02:40:30]  I can't see where.  Wow.  He really puts it on.  I'm starting to think  it might be fake.  What does Steve say?  No.  No, you know what?  You really think it's real?  Oh, yeah.  It almost seems like it's fake.  No, no.  I saw some other...  Do you see the bug  going in his mouth  because you can't train  a bug to fly  into his mouth?  You can't really see it  going because the quality  on YouTube isn't so great.  But there's other clips  of this reporter  and it's totally him.  Some of the other audio 
[02:41:00]  isn't as good as that.  That's why I don't have  any other tracks  on that city.  But there's at least  six clips of this guy.  And if you go to  the YouTube or Yahoo videos  and type in reporter etiquette,  there's like six different ones.  It's totally him.  Okay.  It's totally legit.  It's a great, great piece of audio.  Absolutely.  We had Bad Boy Bubby yesterday,  but we didn't get to it  because we were doing  too much yesterday.  Bad Boy Bubby.  We were going to play this  for what?  Kelly?  Robert Kelly? 
[02:41:30]  This was so anticlimactic,  the movie.  This movie started off strong.  It started off so odd  and such a just sexually perverse,  disturbing movie.  And it turned into just shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you see it?  The ending sucked.  He's having sex with his mother  and his mother keeps him  locked in the apartment  and he has to wear a gas mask  if he leaves the apartment.  Well, he doesn't wear it.  She wears it to keep him  from going out.  Oh, that's right.  She says that the air is poison.  Right.  So he's got to stay in it.  He's been in there for years  and years and years. 
[02:42:00]  And then he finally leaves  because his mother's dead.  Doesn't he kill her or something?  I mean, she just died.  Well, what I saw,  I only saw a small part of it.  And I wound up  turning  and that's all I saw. 
[02:42:30]  It's so exhausting.  Oh, God.  It's annoying as hell.  It's exhausting.  It's exhausting.  Are you holding on?  Oh, my God.  You stop breathing  because you're rooting for the kid  even though it's you, Jimmy.  All right.  Here's Bad Boy Bubby.  Just a taste 
[02:43:00]  because we were talking  about it yesterday.  You're a sexy woman, Flo.  By the way,  the sexy woman he's talking about  is his mom with giant boobies.  Yeah.  She's a fat mess with big boobies  and he's having sex  with his own mom.  Mom.  But his mom...  You're a sexy woman, Flo.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  You've got great tits.  Great big whoppers of things.  One of the seven wonders of the world. 
[02:43:30]  I don't think this was Bubby, though.  Huh?  Wasn't this the guy  that was fucking her  and then he killed them?  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  And that's how he got out  of the house.  Oh, all right.  Because he had killed them.  Yeah, you're right.  Because Bubby just kind of  sat there like an idiot  as his mother like,  that's a good boy.  Yeah.  Squatted on his fat cock.  That big, fat, Bubby cock.  Was he big?  I don't remember.  Oh, of course he was.  He's half retarded.  Of course he's got a giant hog. 
[02:44:00]  There.  There's his mum.  Look at the video, Jimmy.  There's his mum.  Jimmy, look at the video.  I see.  Look at you.  Yeah, and he winds up killing these.  Oh, look at you.  You're quite the bird.  That's bad boy Bubby, though.  He's got great hair.  Now, Bubby comes in, right?  No, that's the guy  that's dating Bubby's mum.  And then he gets pissed  at Bubby.  Starts beating Bubby up.  Bubby fights back. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, right.  This is where he kills him.  Who kills who?  I think Bubby kills both of them.  Sure.  Oh, Bubby,  why don't you simmer down?  Look how he kills him.  Yeah, wraps plastic bags  around their head.  Yeah, saran wrap around.  Sorry, mum.  Oh, she's unconscious.  Look at this sick bug.  And just saran wraps their heads.  That's nice of Bubby.  Is that Bubby or no?  That's Bubby.  He's doing the saran wrapping or no?  Yeah.  Oh, Bubby's a nice boy.  Yeah, he's a good boy.  And he takes the dead cat with him. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  He takes the dead cat everywhere.  All right.  Get off the fucking road,  you fucking greedy bastard.  Get off the fucking road,  you fucking greedy bastard.  That's such promise.  Yeah.  And then it just got like,  it turns silly.  He hooked up with some rock band 
[02:45:30]  or something.  Yeah, we're going to cut our losses.  Really?  Yeah, that's stupid.  There's the cat with the saran wrap over it.  Look at the cat with the saran wrap.  His dead cat that he just carries with him.  That is a great saran wrapped cat.  Fucking Bubby.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Fucking his mum.  And continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Animationfest.net for the animations.  And they're all up on YouTube.  Just throw in Opie and Anthony animations  and you'll get to all of them. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Our duties do do do do do.  Our duties do do do do.  Our duties do do do.  Have destructive power.  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it a month ago.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And we're back.  Somebody from Whack Bag.  Oh, whose is this? 
[02:46:30]  Writes, breaking news that Dana White will announce  that he has put together a team of investors,  including Vince McMahon,  to purchase UFC from Zuffa.  Really?  Report on Sherdog.com.  S-H-E-R-Dog.com.  Announcement on CNBC at 1240 today.  I wanted to guess.  Very, very interesting.  Oh, you want to guess this, Jimmy?  I'm just fine.  That's good.  All right.  Forget it.  So that's happening as we speak. 
[02:47:00]  Whatever.  UFC.  That would have been fun.  You know what the number one movie is now?  I do.  Hey, you know what, though?  So it was because Couture wants to go and fight Fedor,  Emiliano Enko, however you say his name,  and fucking Tito was just shit-talking Dana.  That could be bad for both of those guys.  You know they want to leave UFC anyway,  but where are you going to go?  Vince McMahon getting involved with the UFC could be very interesting.  He's smart.  Very interesting. 
[02:47:30]  What the hell is that in there?  I don't agree with this.  What, my love?  We're going to get into that in a second.  Danny, we've got a quick hit here.  What is this, Danny?  You should set this up.  The transition thing.  Yeah, it's actually something that Derek had found.  You know how sometimes, though, if an episode on TV will have a very special episode,  how the announcer is all somber and he has to say it all slow.  On a very special.  And then they'll have the really upbeat episode of the wacky comedy 
[02:48:00]  and then the voiceover for that is all upbeat.  Zoom it and living in an apartment.  And Derek found one that couldn't get more perfect than this one.  Really?  Yeah, it goes from a very special Mr. Belvedere  to some, like, wacky slap Mackie show or something like that.  Next.  Hey, Leslie.  Don't go with him.  An important Mr. Belvedere.  Mike tried to put his hands on him or something.  What do you mean, Liz?  That's, that's what he did to me.  Then everybody's happy slaps back. 
[02:48:30]  I want him out of here.  Cool it, comrade, okay?  Slap Maxwell returns with a new episode tonight.  Slap Maxwell after a kid's being touched.  Kid toucher.  That's great.  It sounds like it could be the same show, right?  That was Mr. Belvedere with the kid toucher?  Mr. Belvedere.  Like, all those dopey fucking shows back then had to have the special episode where...  The kid touching show.  ...some kid is getting touched or someone's doing drugs.  Mr. Belvedere. 
[02:49:00]  What did Mr. Belvedere step in?  Why are you touching that lad?  He was the molester.  Yeah.  I didn't stay from the episode.  Shit.  Don't forget, when people started getting into therapy and shit in the 70s, and like, all  this stuff started to be talked about, never discussed in the 60s.  In the 70s, a lot of this was still kind of taboo, so they started dealing with race.  So this kind of stuff was just being touched in the 80s, and that's why all these sitcoms  were doing little pieces on it.  Yeah, I guess so.  Because in the 70s, they didn't touch child molesting.  What the hell one did I see?  It was, I guess, Family Ties with... 
[02:49:30]  Oh, where the fucking Michael is trying to make something and his hands are all over?  No.  That was...  Oh, God.  That was the reunion show.  No, it was Tom Hanks, I think.  Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks in what?  Was doing drugs.  What?  In what show?  Yeah, he played like an uncle.  In where?  In Family Ties.  Really?  A one-off, you know?  Uh-huh.  Came in and did drugs.  He was wanted for drug use?  For very special Family Ties.  And stock embezzling or something? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He was also into stock embezzling.  Is that for everybody or just us, E-Rock?  I don't even know what that is.  Was E-Rock talking to everybody or just us?  Maybe just us.  No, that was everybody.  Oh.  Good.  So that means the whole audience had to suffer.  He couldn't win.  Whatever his answer was, he was going to get the hit.  He gave us some good knowledge.  No, he didn't.  Neighbors.  Man masturbated.  Laughed at us.  Fort Walton beat Florida.  Yeah, this is a really funny story.  Police used a laser to measure exactly how far away a suspect was when witnesses said 
[02:50:30]  he masturbated and laughed at them.  Jesus.  The 44-year-old man is charged with exposure of sexual organs.  A misdemeanor.  Witnesses said he was standing just inside an open second-story window of a residence  on Wright Parkway holding the organ in his hand and laughing.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  That's a guy who really handles pressure well.  Like, my dick would be fucking so shriveled that people were looking at me, but this guy's  just, like, jacking off, having a ball. 
[02:51:00]  Right, right.  That's a guy who keeps his sense of humor.  But he's in his own house, so what's the problem?  Why is this a misdemeanor?  Because...  Stop looking through the window, you creep.  Yeah, but there is something...  I don't know what the law is, obviously, that's why I said something, which prevents you from  doing that in plain sight.  All right.  Even if you're in your own home?  If you're in the window and it's obvious that you're trying to be seen, I think so.  Sure.  When police went into the residence, the man was lying on a bed in the upstairs bedroom  and said he was just preparing for a post-shower nap. 
[02:51:30]  His hair was not damp, though, police said, and it did not appear that he had recently  showered.  You want to guess the distance?  The distance between the witness's doorstep and the man's bedroom?  Window?  Anybody?  Hmm.  Ten feet.  Eighty feet. 
[02:52:00]  Eighty?  Yes.  And an officer had to measure this with a certified laser instrument.  The man later told a detective he was urinating out of his bedroom window.  What the fuck is it?  What the fuck?  Yeah, he's pissing out the window.  That's just funny.  Come on.  What the fuck is wrong with people?  We're bored.  We're bored.  They're taking our entertainment away from us, so we just get bored and do stupid stuff  now.  Well, this just in from my sister Dawn. 
[02:52:30]  Janet Jackson got molested on Good Times.  Really?  Yes, she did.  Remember that?  Little Penny?  Good Times, yeah.  All that shit.  Good Times.  They had a burner with an iron?  Oh, right, right.  She was abused also.  Yeah, she was like a...  I know they were...  And that's why Walona took her in.  I know they were trying to do good back then, but there's probably a lot of people that tuned  in those shows having no idea that it was a special episode and just seeing horrific  things going on with their favorite characters. 
[02:53:00]  It's like, this isn't a comedy.  Edith got raped.  Edith got raped.  Yeah, that was another one.  That was a biggie.  And MASH.  I mean, again, it was different.  Not a sexual subject.  No sexual, but they killed off Colonel Blake.  They did some really amazing things in MASH for a sitcom to pull off.  Yeah.  With laugh tracks and then the fucking Blake gets...  You know, it was before sexual stuff was acceptable, though.  I remember when they would roll credits at the end of a special episode when something 
[02:53:30]  would happen.  And you'd hear the audience kind of go like, oh.  And then Florida and James would just be standing there looking at each other.  And they would fade out and go to the credits.  And my TV was so bad, it used to buzz whenever white letters came on the screen.  Everyone's TV did that.  So you'd just hear...  It was a different tone buzz whenever the letters came on.  But you didn't hear the Good Times music playing, which normally camouflaged it. 
[02:54:00]  Good times.  Good times for everybody.  Mm-hmm.  Sporting News Top 20 Movies That Make Men Cry.  I don't get number 14.  14, okay.  It's not a crying movie.  I don't get number 19.  I don't have to guess.  Well, we really are a shallow, awful country.  I don't think I cried at number one. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, I did.  Did you?  Yes.  Fag.  I'm not a fag.  What part of number one did you cry?  Number nine.  Why?  It was a place to...  Wait, go to...  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on there, Steve.  We'll get to you and all the other callers in a minute or two here.  Sporting News Top 20 Movies That Make Men Cry.  Number 20, It's a Wonderful Life.  Oh.  I don't remember seeing that, so...  Hey!  Merry Christmas, Emporium!  Merry Christmas! 
[02:55:00]  Merry Christmas, Savings and Loan!  We're going to get through this.  That's right.  Keep your head down.  Schindler's List.  I just cried like a baby.  What part?  The book actually made me cry harder because they went into more details about the little  girl with the red dress, which is just chilling.  Schindler's List?  Yeah.  That was...  Spielberg was such a genius to shoot that film in black and white and have that little...  that girl in the red dress running through the war song, you know, and then the dress is  in the pile of clothes. 
[02:55:30]  Yep.  But he described it.  Oscar Schindler just described her running in and out in between these soldiers and how  she just was invisible to them.  It was miserable.  But at the end, that made me cry.  And the end of when he's just, you know, trading a watch for it.  It was awful.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  How did you not?  18.  I mean, central to the war effort.  That was awful, too.  Are you?  Yeah.  Do you cry at movies, Anthony?  I didn't cry at It's a Wonderful Life, and I did not cry at Schindler's List. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  The bit is, if any of these movies made you, like, you know, I know you're not even going  to...  You don't want to admit you cried, so how about a little moisture in the eyeballs?  How about...  We'll just go with a little moisture in the eyeballs.  How about if you swallowed, um...  A gulp?  You'd hear a...  Gulp.  All right.  Yeah.  Frequency?  Uh...  I think this was, uh, Dennis Quaid?  Yeah, yeah.  That was the one where he was the guy's father.  Well, he communicated with his father or his son through radio. 
[02:56:30]  He was talking to his father from the past, because his father was dead, so he was talking  to him in the past and trying to solve a crime at the same time, kind of a thing.  No.  No, I didn't cry.  It was kind of a cool little twist of an ending where, you know, Dad was still alive,  because he didn't die, because his kid told him to stop smoking, and he didn't get cancer,  and he didn't die, and he pulled out the shotgun and actually saved his son.  Oh, it was like a time machine thing. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, not really a time machine thing.  Like a back-to-the-future thing.  He had to get evidence from him, and he goes, okay, take my wallet and put it underneath  the window, underneath one of the wood slats.  So he put it underneath one of the wood slats, and then the kid, his son, found it right there  after he had asked him to put it in there, because it had been sitting there for like  25 years.  Right.  Pretty fucked up.  It was actually a really cool movie that I don't think a lot of people saw.  No. 
[02:57:30]  Dead Poets Society.  Yes.  What part, Jimmy?  Oh, when the father discovers his son has just shot himself.  His reaction.  Oh, really?  My son, my son.  It was fucking terrible.  I didn't see it.  Yeah, there was a great suicide.  You never saw Dead Poets Society?  No.  Where the, uh...  Pretty good movie.  He's dead.  The kid is setting up to commit suicide.  He opens the thing with the gun.  It's very well shot.  And you just see...  So is he.  Mom, mom, mom.  The father and the mother are in bed, and they just pan to them, and you... 
[02:58:00]  The father bolts up.  You don't hear the gunshot.  Oh.  The father just bolts up it in bed.  Right, right.  And then you know what he's heard, but they never show it.  Right.  And he walks down, and then he finds...  You just see him splayed out with the gun, smoking.  And the father just collapsed.  It was great.  I forgot that that was in the movie until you just said it.  So well done.  16th place, Forrest Gump.  What part of Forrest Gump makes people cry?  Oh, come on. 
[02:58:30]  When his wife dies of the AIDS.  No, that didn't.  That annoyed me.  Yeah, of course.  I'll tell you this one.  When his mama died.  Yeah, fuck her.  Nah, Sally Field annoyed me.  Sally Field, I know.  Just quit fucking her.  I didn't want to hear.  So what part made you cry in Forrest Gump?  Stop beating her.  I dropped a tear when he asked if his kid...  It was stupid.  And my kid's stupid like me.  Yeah.  No, he's the scary kid from Sixth Sense.  Shut up.  That one got me.  Moisture, Anthony, on it? 
[02:59:00]  Nothing from Forrest Gump.  Still no moisture in the eyeballs.  Nope.  All right.  How about The Natural?  No.  Never saw it.  To me, it was just a dopey baseball movie.  Pretty exciting home run, though.  With the lights breaking, oh.  What did he do?  14, Shawshank Redemption.  Now, when are you supposed to cry at Shawshank?  Maybe when he fucking hangs himself?  Yeah, that was kind of depressing.  That was the funniest part.  How is that funny?  Every time I see that, I only think of Danny now.  I think of Danny and start laughing. 
[02:59:30]  Why?  What did Danny do?  Because it's just the way he talks with the old guy Brooks.  I think I'll rob the food way.  Yeah, when he talks about the food way.  The food way.  And then, I could take care of my manager, kind of like a bonus.  Just the way he delivers that speech is fantastic.  I could shoot the manager, kind of like a bonus.  Yeah.  Things are moving awful fast.  People went and got themselves in a big hurry.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm just going to fucking hang myself.  That didn't really...  It was surprising that he did it, but it didn't bring any tear or anything. 
[03:00:00]  That was pretty depressing.  I'll tell you what made me cry in that movie, is after they raped Tim Robbins, they didn't  show the load.  The sisters.  When the sisters got him.  They didn't continue the scene where he had to, you know, do some cum eating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had a Viking's hand from Bad Voice.  Deeply disturbing yesterday.  13th place, top 20 movies that make men cry.  Big Fish. 
[03:00:30]  Big Fish was a little bit of a sad movie.  That movie came...  If you don't have a daddy.  Well, the movie came out right around the time I lost my daddy.  Oh, boy.  So I have not seen that movie yet.  Oh, don't...  Is it about big fishes?  Yes.  Yes.  Did not see it.  I read the book, though.  It's weird.  The movie's weird.  I did read the book, though.  Weird fucking movie.  And the book was extremely strange, and I wanted to watch the movie to kind of, like, fill  me in.  Yeah.  Odd movie.  Movies have a way of doing that for you.  Thank you. 
[03:01:00]  Seabiscuit.  You see Seabiscuit.  I don't remember, though, if it made me cry.  What happened if the horse and the fucking thing ran?  I don't think it did.  Oh, and then they put a tent over him and shot him in the head.  They should have.  No, I didn't see Seabiscuit, but I can't see me crying at that.  I saw it.  It was way too long.  Yeah.  Way too...  Well, I did cry at the next one.  Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King?  Yes.  At the end, when they're all jumping on the bed together, and... 
[03:01:30]  And the crane comes through the ceiling?  No, no, no.  They're just jumping on the bed together, and...  Oh, that's right.  I didn't get sad.  I got all horny and homo.  Your dick cried all over your stomach.  That could be the gayest scene in a movie.  Oh, my God.  No, I wasn't crying at Lord of the Rings.  The Return of the King did not make you go teary-eyeball.  You know what?  Let me think, because at the end, I guess...  What's his name there?  The Hobbit fucking guy there. 
[03:02:00]  Hobbit guy.  Hobbit guy fucking...  Yeah.  Bilbo?  No, no.  Frodo.  Teddo.  Frodo Baggins.  When he gets on the death boat with the wizard.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  I wasn't a big Lord of the Rings guy, to be honest with you.  The movies are pretty good.  I know that's not cool to say, but...  The movies are good.  Couldn't be bothered.  Too many fucking minutes.  Too many hours.  That's good.  Oh, The Kid Crashed a Car in Seabiscuit.  That's right.  Thank you, Florida Steve, for that. 
[03:02:30]  I don't remember that.  The Passion of the Christ in 10th place.  That was...  Didn't say it.  That was the last movie I saw with my dad, and I only saw him cry, I think, twice.  Oh, boy.  And boy, did he cry during that movie.  So, that made me cry.  I don't know if I did or not.  The Passion of the Christ was ridiculous.  We get it.  He got beat up a lot.  I don't know if I cried to that.  Maybe I did.  That was a pretty intense fucking scene.  I'll give that a yes.  I don't remember.  It was brutal, man.  And then, like, you know, Mommy's there as Christ is getting beaten up. 
[03:03:00]  He blew it, though.  At the end, though, that one scene on the cross with Mary's there.  Yeah.  And she's like, are you okay?  And he's like, JT...  J...  J...  C...  Oh, no.  Boom!  Boom!  That joke should be a movie I'm crying.  Did you see that joke? 
[03:03:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  Boom!  It's a war.  All right.  It didn't go over well.  Wimzak!  Wimzak!  Wimzak!  Wimzak!  Let's reset.  I'll do it again.  All right.  What do you have to say about it?  Passion of the Christ.  The Passion of the Christ.  Yeah.  The one part was really sad when he's on the cross and the mother says, are you okay?  And he goes, J.C. in the house. 
[03:04:00]  See?  I knew that.  J.T.  J.T. Walsh.  J.T.  I loved Christ when he was in fucking the beginning of Sling Blade.  What a cunt I am.  J.T. in the house.  J.T.  What a fucking fool.  He is.  He is.  He is.  He is.  He is a blithering idiot.  That's great.  What I hate about the Passion of the Christ is it was very predictable.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  What are you expecting?  A big M.L.  Shamalanalan fucking twist?  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  They let him off the cross in the end.  Ninth place.  Top 20 movies that make men cry.  You got something there, Dan?  No.  Never too late.  Yes, it is.  It is all right.  They're laughing in the office.  E.T.  What makes you cry in E.T.?  Boy, Spielberg wrecked it by putting walkie-talkies in the fucking agent's hands.  He's superimposing in walkie-talkies instead of guns.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he did.  The FBI agents.  Yeah.  Why do they do that again? 
[03:05:00]  Because he's against guns now?  Because guns are full of faggots.  They're horrible things that children shouldn't see.  Hollywood is full of faggots and fucking dishonest sissies.  I forgot.  Come on, Steven.  Fuck, kids!  Right.  There's a fucking creature flying a bike with no propulsion system.  It's already a fancy.  It's a monster with a kid in a basket in front of the whole fucking moon and shit.  It's very dangerous.  He can't use the phone to get home because he has AT&T. 
[03:05:30]  He says, hey, fucking Elliot.  Yeah, guns.  AT, talk to yourself and hear echo.  Guns are bad, but let kids all over the world think that they can talk to aliens.  I know.  And aliens are your friends.  And ride bikes.  And ride bikes.  They fly.  Off cliffs because they assume they can fly because that's what they saw in the movie.  Yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  The Green Mile.  That was pretty good.  It was in eighth place.  I don't remember.  Eighth place.  What a society of dummies. 
[03:06:00]  I don't think I...  No.  You don't like the Green Mile?  You sure would like some of your wife's fine cornbread.  Yeah.  Coffee.  Like the drink only spelled different.  No.  Big dope.  Big dummy.  Big healing dummy.  Then he'd fucking heal somebody and then blow out Iraq breath out of his mouth.  Number seven should be a lot higher.  Saving Private Ryan. 
[03:06:30]  Top 20 movies that make men cry.  Just at the end.  Yeah, of course.  But that's a tearjerker.  Where they zoom back in or out of the blue eye and it turns out to be Matt Damon's character.  Is what?  Is Private Ryan.  And he's kind of goes to the grave of Tom Hanks and, you know, kind of tells him he hopes  he was, you know, turned out to be a good man as his wife because so many people sacrificed 
[03:07:00]  their life to save his.  Oh, okay.  And it was kind of very tearjerker-y.  I didn't like that movie as much as I thought I would.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  There's some great movies on this list.  I thought that was...  You didn't like Private Ryan?  I should see it again.  I'm going to Blu-ray the motherfucker.  I'll watch it again.  And that scene where that big fucking Nazi stabs that kid up in the house real slow. 
[03:07:30]  After they're just fighting.  He's fighting for his life.  He gets pinned down and just slowly drives that bayonet into him.  She's speaking in German and just tells him to shh.  I'm just going to kill you now.  That was a pretty horrible scene.  And the guy got bludgered.  Don't you shush me, mister.  Hey, now.  While that chicken shit stood on the stairs.  Number six.  Top 20 movies that make men cry.  Pride of the Yankees. 
[03:08:00]  Yes.  Which one is this?  That's the story of Joe DiMaggio's fingers.  Pride of the Yankees.  That's fucking brilliant.  That's a dosy.  That's shit.  And then we go with number five, which is the hackiest movie on this entire list.  Stupid Rudy.  Yeah, fuck that asshole and there's no talent.  Stupid Rudy comes in for one goddamn play.  It may be quite a little because it was true, though. 
[03:08:30]  That was what got me about it is the fact that it was a true story.  This fucking cunt of a nobody water boy goes to tackle someone.  He's a big shit dick.  They carry him off and then they fucking abuse him because he's a retard.  They don't do that in real life.  They didn't carry him off in real life.  I doubt it.  It was the first time in a long time that somebody didn't carry off the field at Notre Dame.  Really?  Yes, look at the end.  And what did he do in the real game?  What's that?  What did he do in the real game?  Because you know Hollywood had to punch it up.  That was the portrayal.  He just tackled somebody.  So I kind of liked it for that.  He didn't save a game.  He was just in on one play. 
[03:09:00]  Right.  Making the big play.  But he didn't make the big play.  I know.  It was just a nothing play.  So I kind of liked it.  I'll give Rudy that.  He sucked.  But who believed that...  What was his name?  Sean Astin or whatever?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  He was a football player.  He was a soft mess.  Well, that's what he was supposed to be.  That's why he wasn't on the team.  Yeah, but then you got to think he started going to the gym and got himself in shape for  the big game.  Well, no, he didn't.  He never got past being just a soft mess in the movie.  I hated it. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, Braveheart is your fourth movie.  Braveheart.  Top 20 movies that make men cry.  Now, the scene where his wife gets her throat slit, that isn't so sad as it is just really  fucking like, oh my God, pretty tragic.  That was incredibly sad.  No, it was done in a way that wasn't really that sad.  How could you expect Anthony to be sad about a wife getting her throat slit?  He was sad they didn't stab her first.  That's incredibly sad. 
[03:10:00]  No, it was done in a way where it was more ruthless on the guy's part than it was sad  for the, you know.  But he was in love.  He had his whole life right there.  Yeah, I know.  He had the perfect life.  And that's why it wasn't like that.  It wasn't really done that that way where it was that that sad.  It was ruthless.  It wasn't really sad.  It was fucking like, holy shit.  You don't get into like, uh, shocked Mel Gibson's character's head, though, and realize  what that would do to him.  I think at the end, when he yells out freedom, when his guts are being pulled out, you know, 
[03:10:30]  that's a, you know, at least you're going to get goosebumps.  Yeah.  Look at this faggot moments we're having here.  Oh, hold on, man.  We could just call this faggot moments.  Men having fag moments.  Let's go to Mike on Long Island.  Yeah, Mike.  Hey, guys.  I don't know if you're going back to Rudy there, but they did an interview with the  real guy on Mike and the Mantle years ago, and he actually never got into the game.  He dressed, and that was about it.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  He didn't even play at all? 
[03:11:00]  No, he didn't even play at all.  They let him dress, but he never got out there.  I think they did carry him off, and that part of the movie's true, where they said he's  the only first guy to be carried off of the last guy.  Yeah.  But he never got in the game at all.  Maybe they weren't allowed to put him in the game because he was a fucking 80-year-old  possible pederast.  Pederast.  At that point.  Fucking douche.  We get it.  You like football.  Go home and watch it.  Fucking nobody.  We got two completely different views.  Craig from Scranton, no hope the aftermath was sad, not the actual event, and is correct. 
[03:11:30]  Okay.  Oh, thank you.  No, when she was getting killed, that was incredibly sad for me.  No, for you.  Yes.  And there's other people out there that would find that sad as well.  You know why?  Because Mel Gibson didn't really see it either.  He didn't see it happening.  So maybe stupid me, I was thinking ahead, going, wow, this guy's going to find out that his  fucking family's gone.  Yeah.  So maybe I think ahead a little bit.  Nah, I didn't think it was, that part was like sad. 
[03:12:00]  Hmm.  All right.  How about Gladiator when he went back to his house and his fucking wife and kid are hanging  up?  That was pretty intense.  And they burnt him and everything?  Oh, wait, that's the movie I'm thinking of.  Oh.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  Ah, shit.  I've got to throw myself under the bus.  Yeah, that one's pretty fucking fucked up.  That's the one I was thinking of the whole time.  Oh, that's hysterical. 
[03:12:30]  Wait, what's the Braveheart thing then?  Braveheart is where.  I've got a brain fart here.  Where if they got married, the head muckety-muck in the village there gets to fuck your wife  first.  So they got married in secret.  Right.  And they were in the little village and one of the guys wanted to have sex with Mel Gibson's  wife.  And of course, they both weren't going to allow it.  So she fought and punched a few of the head guy's people, servants, whatever. 
[03:13:00]  And he got mad.  So to show discipline, he put her against a pole and slit her throat right there.  She just fell down.  Did she learn her lesson?  She didn't do it again.  And later on, Mel Gibson takes a knife and puts him against the pole and slits his throat.  Of course.  So it wasn't that sad.  To make her right.  Exactly.  Yeah, that was sad too.  But Gladiator was when the Romans went down and crucified his fucking little kid and wife. 
[03:13:30]  And he was drooling a lot on them.  Yeah.  And I swear to God, I got to make stuff.  I'm a dope today.  Gladiator is just a great fucking movie.  Don't fuck with me.  I can watch that all the time.  Hey, the Rudy caller is...  Yeah, he's wrong.  What?  The guy that said that Rudy didn't play.  Really?  Yeah, he's wrong.  He played the final play in that game in 75 and did indeed record a sack on the quarterback.  Hey, you shithead.  Good.  Yeah, but someone wrote it this way. 
[03:14:00]  The Rudy caller is a jackass.  Here is footage of Rudy playing in the game and making his meaningless tackle.  His meaningless.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, here.  Okay.  Here's the meaning.  Where is he?  Which one is Rudy?  Where's Rudy the fucking jizz bag?  The little guy.  Hold on.  All right, this is where he makes his meaningless tackle.  Where?  I don't know.  Where is he?  It's the fucking...  He's letting a guy score a touchdown.  I think that was the...  Number 21?  No, no, no.  That was the touchdown that put them way over, that allowed Rudy to get in the game. 
[03:14:30]  All right, now the extra point.  So where's stupid Rudy?  And then Rudy comes in.  Where's Rudy?  It's Notre Dame 24, Georgia Tech 3.  28 seconds.  They're finally...  28 seconds.  29 seconds to go.  Worthless piece of shit coming in.  All right.  Here comes that fucking shit dick.  Wouldn't it be funny if he missed a tackle and four touchdowns scored?  He scored 38 points.  All right, let the guy that should have been retarded in the game.  All right, he catches it at the fucking... 
[03:15:00]  No, this is still footage.  Where's Rudy?  Here, now he's got to come.  Now he's got to do it.  All right, where's Rudy?  Here, here he goes.  Here he goes.  No.  Where's Rudy?  That's a hell of a pass.  Are we watching the game in real time?  Yeah.  Where the fuck is Rudy?  He watches his old fucking college game.  I'll be here.  All right, where's Rudy?  All right, it's got to be this one, right?  No.  The quarterback fires another pass off.  Look at this motherfucker moving him downfield.  75.  I don't know.  All right, where's Rudy?  Is this Rudy?  I hope so. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  He drops back and...  Yeah, Rudy.  Oh, two guys are on him.  He assisted a sack.  Two guys are on him.  Wow.  Oh, this is it?  Oh, no.  Replay.  What number is Rudy?  Yeah, we just grabbed him.  He's one of 40 men who fell on the quarterback.  I know.  Dude, that's...  The quarterback was fucking pinned.  That's when...  That's when you first go fishing with your dad, and he gets a fish and then lets you reel it in.  That's the only guy who made the tackle.  Right.  They should have called this Doody, because it was shit. 
[03:16:00]  Or Moody, because it's making me cranky.  Or Judy, because he tackles like a girl.  Foodie the fat fuck.  That's right.  Or Stoodie, because he should have done more of that in school.  Dude.  Oh, that's funny.  Hey, uh...  Kurt in Michigan has something.  Kurt, go.  Now.  Kurt, go.  Yellow, Kurt. 
[03:16:30]  Yellow.  Kurt.  From Michigan.  Yo, what's that, man?  Grandfather cried at Saving Private Ryan.  There you go.  Thank you, Kurt.  Yeah, you can't show the old-timers Saving Private Ryan.  No.  Without tears being shit.  No.  Number three.  Top 20 movies that make men cry.  Anyone?  Anyone?  I have the list I can't.  Bueller?  Anyone?  But I agree with this one.  Brian's song.  Brian Piccolo has cancer. 
[03:17:00]  He was...  Oh, Lord.  But he wasn't a great player, was he?  Jesus, hope.  No, it was James Caan in the movie.  Yep.  And who was the black guy there?  Billy Dee Williams.  Oh, it was Billy Dee.  Motherfucker, Billy Dee.  Number two.  The runner-up movie that makes men cry.  Paul Whitfield.  I don't remember it, though.  Old Yeller.  Yeah, didn't see it.  You never saw Old Yeller?  Could give a flying fuck about Old Yeller.  A dead dog will make you cry every time. 
[03:17:30]  Well, he's got to shoot the dog.  The kid's got to shoot his own dog.  Ask Louis C.K.  Because he got the rabies, I think.  Right?  Yeah.  Isn't that it?  Yeah, he was frothing.  He had to do the right thing.  Rabies.  And so he had to shoot Old Yeller.  He got the rabies.  The rabies.  And number one movie that makes men cry.  This is it.  It did make me cry. 
[03:18:00]  The big one.  Which part?  It's when he went to have the catch with his father.  Field of Dreams.  Yeah, man.  That's right, Jimmy.  It was sad.  Oh, here comes D-Roll Pop to play a little catch.  Yeah.  Pop's a corpse.  Next thing you know, he's fucking throwing around.  You ever play catch with the old man?  Zombie dad?  Zombie dad?  Well, he played baseball.  He played catch with his zombie dad, right?  What?  Didn't his dad come back?  Yeah.  From the dead?  But you don't pay attention that he's coming back from the dead.  What is he going?  You just enjoy the moment. 
[03:18:30]  Brains.  Brains.  Dad, let's catch.  As he, like, gnaws your fucking head off.  Zombie dad.  You ever play catch with the old man?  What?  Yeah, catch what he's throwing at the wall.  That's about all I fucking play catch with my dad.  I don't remember ever playing catch with my dad or anything.  You ever have a moment with your dad, you and him?  Maybe it's not a sports thing?  Yeah, I remember when he smacked me in the face for stealing quarters so I could get ice cream sandwiches because I was starving.  But why were you starving?  Because there was no food.  Because all the money went to beer and to pay for the horse's hay. 
[03:19:00]  So I was starving.  So I went into their room and grabbed a bunch of quarters and got a box of ice cream sandwiches and ate them.  And then he asked me if I stole the quarters when I was in the truck.  And I said, no.  And he goes, okay.  Whap!  He smacked me across the face.  He goes, that's for taking the quarters.  Whap!  And that's for lying about it.  Oh, my God.  And I was like, but I was hungry.  And you did it for survival. 
[03:19:30]  That's a good diet, by the way.  I was very hungry.  I ate an entire box of ice cream sandwiches.  I was at the age where you could do that.  How did you know you stole and did you smell your little lactose farts?  Your little milk farts?  Because there was no one else there.  My brother and sister weren't out there yet.  So it was just me in the house who took it.  The dog?  Come on.  Did you ever have a moment?  Let's get a little serious here.  Me and my dad used to shoot free throws in the driveway.  And it was our time to just kind of be a father-son thing. 
[03:20:00]  You ever have a moment?  Playing catch, shooting free throws, going fishing, hunting together.  I'll think like you.  Getting a hooker.  Getting a hooker, sure, instead of a bicycle.  Not really.  Never went horseback riding together.  Oh, no.  That happened a lot.  We would all saddle up the horses and go for rides.  Yeah.  Yeah, do some shooting.  Jimmy, what about you?  Yes.  What's the moment?  Oh, I don't know. 
[03:20:30]  We're going fishing and stuff.  My dad and I did a good amount of stuff together, playing catch and stuff like that.  Oh, I went fishing.  He was always present.  I remember that.  I'm thinking of California, but now I've got to think back to New York.  And we used to go fishing in some old beat-up rowboat outside of Northport.  And I used to get seasick all the time.  So me and my brother and my father went fishing, and he rode the boat all the way out, like into  the Sound.  And we dropped the lines, and I started getting sick. 
[03:21:00]  And I was crying, of course, because all I did as a kid was cry.  And I had to lay down.  And he was using some kind of crabs for bait.  And I woke up, and there were crabs crawling in my hair.  And I had, like, you know, big Afro hair.  And there were just crabs crawling around in my hair, live crabs.  And so what did I do?  Cry.  Yes.  I started crying again the second I woke up.  Crabs in my hair.  And he said, shut the fuck up.  I was such the little fag. 
[03:21:30]  I should have been gay.  I was always weeping.  I don't know why.  I don't like these clothes.  The kids made fun of the little chocolate treats I brought in for snack day.  I remember fucking crying about that.  And bring some shit in from, it's supposed to be like, you know, international day.  So you're supposed to bring in a food product from your nationality. 
[03:22:00]  So my mother didn't have time to do anything, and she never cooked or anything like that.  So she just picked up these little pastry things.  It looked like shit in a box.  They were brown and mushy and shaped like little nuggets of shit.  And I brought it to school, and all the kids started making fun that I brought shit to school for the snack day. 
[03:22:30]  And what did I do?  Cry.  I started crying because I was so sad that they were making fun of me.  And I went home, and I started crying again in front of my mother, telling her that they have all made fun of me for her shit cookies.  What a little fucking fag.  That's hilarious.  I was constantly crying, constantly.  And then Daddy found out that you were crying over Mom's shit cookies.  Oh, he would smack me in the head. 
[03:23:00]  Why am I smacking you?  What are you doing?  Stop crying.  Knock it off.  It was like, knock it off, or I'll give you something to cry about.  That's what he used to say.  Are you a hitter?  What?  I'm just asking.  I don't hit anybody or anything.  I don't hit.  No, I'm such not a hitter.  I'll choke a bitch.  No, I don't hit at all.  Yeah.  Is it because of your upbringing?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I used to get smacked pretty good.  Pops used to wield a pretty nasty belt at times when we'd do something horrid, like it was 9.05, and me and Joe were still talking. 
[03:23:30]  You know, brothers communicating at 9 o'clock at night.  Because they're excited to be alive.  Hey, because you're a kid, and you're a kid, and you're excited about this.  Maybe you want to talk to your brother about just bullshit.  Yeah.  But no, dad has to come in and smack you with a belt for communicating with your brother.  That's nice.  So, I'd cry. 
[03:24:00]  Joe would just kind of, you know, blow it off and go, eh, whatever.  Whatever.  We'll be out of this mess soon.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  But it all comes out in the wash, you know, 30 years later.  Uh, being afraid of violence so much that you have a gun on your person in the house.  Is that what it, do you think it is?  Of course it is.  That I'm afraid of violence that was around me in my upbringing.  But that's family violence.  It doesn't matter.  It's not rational.  But it wasn't, no, it is rational.  It wasn't violence from an outside source.  I could see if, like, I was mugged at some point in my life, I would be paranoid like that. 
[03:24:30]  But seeing violence between my parents, that would just kind of make me cry.  It's not about the, you know, your father would beat you, it would scare you.  It's not about who the violence came from.  It's about this fucking scary, out of control fear of being hurt.  But, um, it's like, it's the same fear.  It's just, now it's not your family, but it's outside things.  Now it's those people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's just terror of being hurt.  Or being out of control and being hurt. 
[03:25:00]  Do you think Anthony likes bare-bottom spankings because he was hit by a belt?  I used to have to do that as a little, little kid.  What?  He'd go, now pull your pants down.  And I'd have to, and I wouldn't pull him down a lot.  I'd just pull him down a little because he would want to hit me with the belt on, like, bare skin.  Did he cum?  Oh, fucking, like, like no one's business.  So did he.  I left a load on my sheet.  It's a win-win. 
[03:25:30]  My little Bugs Bunny sheets.  Oh, God.  Did I cum?  Oh, that's horrid.  I just tried to bring some humor back into this.  What are you going to do?  That is your upbringing.  What are you going to fucking do?  And this is the adult child of an alcoholic.  Yeah.  And this is the stuff that Anthony is willing to talk about.  I can only imagine.  No, I'm really trying to think back at the other stuff.  I talked about how I was horrified, like, driving with him because he was always weaving on the road. 
[03:26:00]  And we'd take this road called the Ortega Highway out in California.  That was just a windy death trap if you were stone sober in the daytime.  There was always, every fucking year, I went to Dana Hills High School out there.  Every fucking year, one of the kids from Dana Hills would die driving the Ortega.  Over the cliff or whatever.  Just drive off a fucking cliff.  Yeah.  And any time we had to go out there, I was just, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Not out in the Ortega.  Going there wasn't bad because it was pretty much daytime and he was sober.  Coming back because he had been partying and stuff and he's ripped and it's nighttime. 
[03:26:30]  Fucking raining.  Like, just, and these big Conrock trucks, that was like the big cement company out there, would come rumbling down the road and pretty much take up both lanes.  So, you'd have to really get over to the shoulder.  And I was petrified.  You'd feel the rocks under the wheel.  Dude, totally.  I was petrified.  I'd lean my body, like, to try to help steer the truck a little more away from the fucking cliff. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, it petrified me.  When did you stop crying?  Because you used to cry, like, a lot when you were a kid.  And now, like, you...  I got it all out of my system.  When did you stop?  Now, I just don't cry.  When did you stop, though?  When did I stop?  Yeah.  19-ought.  When you discovered pussy, I'm thinking.  Well, hmm.  That might be a good answer.  Well, because I think...  No, I still got, I got a little weepy after that, but...  Well, when you saw pussy for the first time.  Not as much.  I'm sure you cried.  I cried tears of joy. 
[03:27:30]  You cried, because you're like, did I waste all that time collecting baseball cards?  Yeah, and doing model rocketry.  Right.  The first time I slipped my dick inside, I just went like, oh, this is great.  The first time you passed by a mirror, and you went, oh, my God, I am the nerd that I've  made fun of all these years.  Yeah.  I'm a tech guy.  I'm a tech guy.  I liked it, though.  I think it was, like, the discovery of girls, but that caused some tears, too, because,  you know, girls break up with you, and then you get all fucking pissy-eyed. 
[03:28:00]  I've been balling for a fucking month.  Oh, Jimmy.  Why are you balling, Jimmy?  It's my relationship, you know, right?  It's the first time I haven't been completely acting out like a brother.  It's very sad.  It gets sad.  It's fucking heavy, man.  It's good to get out.  I don't know.  Aren't the ending of relationships supposed to be kind of fun?  No.  I mean, not fun, but happy, I should have said.  Happy.  No.  No.  Because they're never good.  Both people never wake up and go, wow, we both gave it a shot.  Let's move. 
[03:28:30]  Very rarely.  Yeah.  It's usually sad.  It's fucking...  Yeah, there's always something.  It's a result of a bunch of shit going wrong.  Yeah.  In love with somebody, and it's fucking gone.  It stinks.  Even though I don't think I would want to be in that situation again.  So you get a little weepy.  Oh, yeah.  But it's good, though.  But I mean, it's either that or you fucking build it up and you wind up getting angry.  Dude, that or it's going to come out in anger.  I like holding it all in.  No kidding.  Until I'm ready to fucking explode.  And then beating up a small child, a little animal. 
[03:29:00]  I'll kill a little animal.  You haven't cried since your girl left?  No.  No, I'll be completely honest with you.  No, I didn't.  I think the last time I really cried was when my father died.  Oh, my God.  That was like 1994, 95.  That's where you first started working together, and you kind of blew it off.  No, I just didn't show anything.  Yeah, well, that's what I meant.  And I had to wait like 24 hours because I didn't want to get upset in front of anybody. 
[03:29:30]  So I had to wait 24 hours after I heard, like, I had to do everything, and then I had to  go home and be alone.  Why didn't you cry in front of people?  Because who was there to cry in front of?  Jennifer?  Ugh.  Ugh.  I wasn't going to do that.  Sorry.  Here, cheer up.  Try to be respectful.  Have a sip of my drink.  Yeah, there's nothing worse than when you're fucking...  She's probably secretly happy because she had her own father issues.  Like, now you're in my health.  Who knows?  There's nothing worse than when you really need somebody who, like, knows what they're 
[03:30:00]  doing emotionally, and you're sad, and they just give you that, ah, your chin up.  Ah, walk it off.  Like, you're not getting this, are you?  Asshole in your 1950s answers.  I love when you put yourself...  Fuck you, Chuck Connors.  I'm fucking a real person, you fucking phony douche.  Having real sadness, and you're telling me to keep my chin up and fucking walk it off.  Oh, my God.  I love when you put yourself out there, and you realize, like, yeah, like you're saying,  you realize, they were just waiting for me to stop talking so they could tell me what's 
[03:30:30]  wrong with them.  Yeah.  But this trumps anything you have to say today.  I fucking hate people...  My dad died, you idiot.  No, I don't want to go to Starbucks.  Fucking people suck.  I hate people that won't acknowledge their own sadness because they think that it's fucking  mad.  It makes me...  It's so irritating that they won't acknowledge it because it's phony, and it's going to come  out one way to be...  No, it's not, though.  It's not you, though.  I do acknowledge my sadness. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, you do.  You're not a macho asshole.  You're just...  I'm not macho.  Pierce from Wackbag...  Pierce from Wackbag has a new nickname for you, Ant.  Uncomfortable throwing in jokes to avoid a real moment, Anthony.  That's me.  Always has been.  Oh, yeah.  Make another joke, funny man.  Cover up those tears.  My mother pointed out to me one time, we were watching some sad show, and I said some  obnoxious comment.  I was young.  I was 12, whatever.  Sure.  Every time there's a sad moment, you have to make some kind of an awful remark. 
[03:31:30]  I'm like, yeah, I know.  And that's that.  It's the end of that story.  Yeah.  To call her a bitch.  I know, bitch.  I knew she was right.  She was right, and it made you feel all silly, uncomfortable.  Did you get hot?  And go like, ugh, she's right.  Dude, I escaped, man.  My sex addiction is so bad.  It's like just jerking off to avoid feeling anything.  It's so silly.  I finally...  But aren't you feeling jerking off?  Nah, it's numb.  That's not...  No?  Nah, it's fucking numbness.  You shoot, and you don't even care. 
[03:32:00]  It doesn't do anything to you.  It gives a shit.  It's meaningless.  Who gives a shit?  I've done it a million fucking times.  I woke up a couple weeks ago.  I just sat in the bed and fucking cried.  But it's like so much human.  Oh, Jimmy.  I don't feel bad.  I don't care.  I don't feel different or unique or bad.  It is what it is.  Like a bad lieutenant.  It's not quite that dramatic.  But Jimmy Tartt...  I'm weak!  What is it called again?  What, emotionally vomiting?  Yeah, I like that term.  Because it's going to come out.  Or it's going to get pushed down so far.  It's going to come out in rage or a fucking stroke or putting your fist through a windshield. 
[03:32:30]  It's not going to just sit there.  Right.  It's like a shit.  So it's like, I'd rather just get it out healthy.  Oh, sorry!  I did so many bad things.  I tried to do the right thing, but I'm weak.  I'm too fucking weak.  Holy shit.  That's a great moment.  God damn, if that isn't fucking every one of us, although not on that level. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, what are you going to do?  We have Tippi Tom crying at Sophie's Choice.  Do we want to play this today?  Oh, God.  Is that good?  We forgot some movies, by the way.  I love that.  Can I point out a couple of movies that were left off the shitty list?  Yes.  That should have been on the list of movies that make men cry?  Sure.  Yeah, fucking old, you know, come on, the Green Mile and E.T. and fucking, just a bunch of  fucking Shawshank.  Shut up, Seabiscuit.  Yeah.  Here's the ones I put on.  Midnight Cowboy.  Ordinary People.  Whose Life Is It Anyway? 
[03:33:30]  Born on the Fourth of July.  How do you not fucking cry watching that?  Yeah.  Yes!  Yes.  Glory.  The Champ.  Do the Right Thing.  The Champ is pretty brutal.  Do the Right Thing.  When fucking Gator got shot.  Ugh.  Fucking Malcolm X.  The end of Malcolm X, I cried.  On Golden Pond.  Oh, I got lost.  That made me laugh.  Oh, the loons.  Dontering asshole. 
[03:34:00]  Fucking idiot.  Once for Warriors, New Zealand film, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Yeah, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was sad.  Every time.  Yeah, well.  Tragic.  Yeah, it is pretty horrible.  Playing cards without McMurphy, you realize what he did for it?  It's awful.  It is pretty horrible.  It's fucking awful.  E.T.  Fucking assholes.  What about Ghost?  Yes, Ghost 2.  Did that little alien want to call home?  Did he?  You fucking Dave Matthews band faggots. 
[03:34:30]  What is that about?  That's just that mentality.  These fucking, just, you know, mediocre douches.  They don't cry at Rico Rizzo fucking dying on the bus.  Of course not.  But there's something in Lord of the Rings that just gets them.  Fucking broken ratso.  All he wanted was to be called Rico.  Stupid ratso.  He fucking, he fucking, he dies on a bus.  He finally gets to Florida.  That was his fantasy.  Was to be important and to run on a beach.  The fucking guy wanted nothing.  But, you know, there's something about the, the, that fucking snotty billionaire twat's 
[03:35:00]  little fucking Harry the Jizbag character that gets them all teary eyed.  A bunch of assholes.  Nice.  You want to do a little Sophie's Choice?  Yeah, I love that.  Which clip?  Which clip?  Track six.  Track six is the good one?  The meat and the potatoes?  Yeah, this is just a tippy Tom talking about one of his favorite movies that make him cry.  Sophie's Choice.  He can't even talk about it.  We made him watch it. 
[03:35:30]  The Germans were wrong.  The Germans were wrong.  But they did.  But they do.  This is your favorite movie.  Explain what's going on because we don't know German.  Tell us what's going on.  The only good thing the Germans did is build a Volkswagen and a Mercedes-Benz.  That's all I ever did right.  Hey, Tippy.  That's German.  This is the scene that got you sad.  Here it comes.  The Nazis talking to Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter. 
[03:36:00]  What's going on?  Tell us.  She's protecting her child.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They're going to steal her baby.  It's a tragic movie.  No.  This movie broke my heart.  They stole her baby.  Because it's not the kind of radio camp in Germany.  No. 
[03:36:30]  Leave it.  No.  No.  It's still her.  Leave it.  No.  The most itchy German.  That movie's so tragic.  It was wrong.  The Germans were wrong.  And I'm German.  And I'm wrong  I didn't do that  I would never do that 
[03:37:00]  That was your people though  I was raised that way  But I'm not that way  We have to get  Tibby Tom back in the air  It's been way too long  When he's yelling no  No  Well next week Dr. Steve is going to be in town  For his Saturday show  Weird Medicine  And if you remember last time Steve said that he would  Examine  Including the finger up the butt  Because that's Dr. Steve's thing 
[03:37:30]  For some reason every time Dr. Steve comes to New York  He has to put a finger in some dude's butt  Look I'm not going to take his bit away from him  Whatever works for you  I'm going to do my best  To hook up with Keith and find Tibby  If we could get Dr. Steve  On our show  To put a finger up Tibby Tom's butt  Radio gold my friends  And then we'll promote Dr. Steve's Saturday Night Virus show  I think we got more Tibby Tom here  Why are you so upset?  I don't get it  Yeah you got so upset  Why are you so upset?  There's tears in your eyes 
[03:38:00]  It's wrong  In those times  Things were different I guess  You ain't going to boo that shit now  Why'd they take the baby though?  The little baby got taken  Oh look she's  Oh no  Look here's the scene  This is what bothers you?  Yes  Starra baby  That's wrong  No  Go fight

It's not about that  You kind of like it  Because  I remember the day  It had to be months ago  At this point  Where Sam's begging us  Come on man  I really want to cut my hair  You're a long  That was months ago  It was many months ago  I think it  Grew into something  That you're enjoying  Well I don't even know  What it is anymore  I don't even remember  What I look like  It's going to be creepy  When you finally cut your hair  We're going to think  You lost your brain

[03:41:00]  That usually does it  And a couple of these  Hit it with the banana  Good  That'll work  That piece was unnecessary anyway  I want to thank XM for  You know  Making sure we broadcasted our show  In a sauna today by the way  Oh god  I'm fucking burning up  Trying to be troopers  But it's fucking hot in here today  I mean jeez  I bet the guys  Are working  Working on rooftops today  They're really sympathizing with us  I know  But it shouldn't be  87 degrees indoors  True  True 
[03:41:30]  Here you go  True that  I say  We'll try that tomorrow there Sam  Let's remind us of that  Here  Here's the piece  Wow  Wow  That's you without your hair  That's what Sam  That's what I used to look like  Holy shit  I don't know  I kind of like the  Yeah you better keep the afro  The wool head  You better keep the afro  Really  Yeah  Yeah  I don't know what's better anymore  You're confused  Can you part it  Yeah I guess so  Can you part it on the side though 
[03:42:00]  Yeah  The big side part  You gotta do the big  What  To come around like that a little bit  Yeah yeah  If he parts his hair like that  He's gonna look exactly like Poindexter  From Revenge of the News  Yeah  You gotta do a split screen  Danny's on to something  Split screen  Get it up on the website  There you go  Let me see  But you gotta let it go now  Oh forget  Oh wow  It goes right back  Yeah it ain't gonna stay  You gotta get a lot of some kind of  That is some springy hair  Adhesive  You didn't miss anything  I didn't think so  We're just trying to part Sam's 
[03:42:30]  We're just trying to get a partner's hair  Get a hatchet  Right  Got it  Yeah  Line of the day  Oof  Hey  I want to  Ask the listeners  If they enjoyed their five hour energy today  Oh  Hey listeners  Did you enjoy your five hour energy today  Yes I loved it  Oh shit  Yeah we gotta do the part like that 
[03:43:00]  See the joke is there were no listeners today  Maybe one  What you won't feel  What you won't feel is jittery or crash  That's because unlike other energy drinks  Five hour energy doesn't jack you up with sugar, caffeine and herbal stimulants  Instead it's packed with stuff  Stuff  Five hour energy  That's good enough right  Yeah  One more to go this week  Yeah I think so yeah  There's more than enough  You went well above and beyond  Thank you Jimmy 
[03:43:30]  Thank you  You're welcome sweetie  We're here if you want to check out the show live  Some days it's just crazy out there  And other days we feel very lonely  Yeah  Without the listeners pestering us about every little thing we do on the show  What is that  Travis just sent me another picture of Sam as a child  Ew  With some wrestlers  Oh my god  That's the great Lou Albano  That's Captain Lou  Look at little Sam  He's so molestable  Oh he sure is  I don't know who's on the right 
[03:44:00]  Who's on the right Sam  The wrestling promoter locally who fucking put Sam  I'll take you to see Captain Lou but you just gotta fucking  You gotta keep this arrangement quiet  You gotta let me kiss you below the tummy  By the way he's the wrestling promoter who kissed Sam below the tummy  We met Sam  Wear his bathing suit covers  Yes  We met Sam's brother at the animation festival  Yes  And he has a little more of the black blood than you do  What do you mean?  Just a little observation  You think so?  A little bit  A little bit more  He's a little more  Well I can't say it like that  Fun  No he looks like he's a nice boy 
[03:44:30]  He's much better looking than me  He's more ish than you  Exactly  Just going with Jimmy's lead there  Well that's Salvatore Sincere  Next to Captain Lou  Who the fuck was he?  He was kind of a low level  He was right?  Worker  Big cock?  I don't know  Because I didn't see it  I assumed he stuck it in you  No  Salvatore was more like  What he enjoyed was Sam  Is he enjoyed 
[03:45:00]  He would nuzzle Sam's tummy  Right  He just kept nuzzling lower  And Sam was young  He didn't understand  He knew it felt wrong  Yeah  As Salvatore's man lips  Like nuzzled the top of his penis  And then Salvatore's probably  An ass eater  Like he would turn young Sam over  And eat his asshole  Oh shit  Like kind of like  Really deep ass eating  Like it would hurt Sam's little bottom  But he wouldn't fuck Sam  He just liked the taste  Of a boy asshole  Robert Kelly's looking at a radio  So we're going  See there he goes again  Oh  But Sam  Way too  Way too much detail 
[03:45:30]  Even at the young age  Sam understood  Like I don't have to like this  There are wrestlers attached to it  But it's Arthur  You're my special helper Sam  Yeah  My special boy  Okay  You're my special wrestling helper  Let's take a picture  To remember the day  I tongued your asshole  This is actually  Just like an autograph signing  Oh that was it  Yeah  Oh  Where's that autograph  Yeah  The Lou Albano  That's in a frame somewhere  Where's the other autograph 
[03:46:00]  I got them all  I have a big binder  Of wrestling autographs  Did Hulk Hogan  Sign over that guy's autograph  No I got it  Space  An 8x10  Signed by Salvatore Sincere  Not that many people have that  Did he diddle your little  Brown tight hole  With a fucking sharpie cap  It's burnt into his ass cheek  Like Beecher from Ross  I bet you what Salvatore  Would do with Sam  When he'd take him  To these wrestling events  Is he'd park somewhere  Yeah  On the way to the event  And he would probably like  Put his hand on the back  Of Sam's shorts  And just like  Press his middle finger 
[03:46:30]  Against Sam's ass crack  And kiss Sam  He'd probably like  To kiss Sam  Oh god damn it  Why would he like  To kiss Sam though  Well look at Sam  At that age  He's just very innocent  And kissable  And the guy would probably  Like that  He would probably just  Kiss Sam's chest  While he cupped  His boy ass  And what would he sound like  While he did this  When he turned  He'd turn Sam over 
[03:47:00]  And when he would  Eat Sam's bottom  And I'm not sure  I'm getting uncomfortable  But it would be like this  It's not a big sound  It's a quiet ugly sound  And Sam would have to go home  With like razor stubble burn  Just feeling dirty  Because like he would  He would dry his bottom  With like the back of his shirt  But he'd pull his pants up  And then sit back in the seat  But Salvatore's tongue  Had been so deep in his ass  He could still feel wet 
[03:47:30]  In his asshole  Okay  Like he feels still  Like even though  He just dabbed gently  Salvatore didn't care  He wouldn't tell Sam no dry  That's a hell of an imagination  Sam would try to push his underwear  Into his butt cheeks  To dry it  It just sounds get me  Also young Sam  Looked whiter as a child  Yeah  Well my hair used to be  Very blonde  I was born with  White blonde hair  Really? 
[03:48:00]  Yes  No that was  Must have loved that  That was  Mom and dad  You know  Oh  Yeah  They were like  They just got tired of  Well they wanted to make you  Look as white as possible  To save you a lot of grief  Did he make  Cumzies on you?  No I met Salvatore  Sincere just that one time  At the autograph signing  Yeah  I'll bet you what he would do  Is he would do things to Sam  That he liked as an adult  Like he was trying to get Sam  Into heavy nipple play  Like I bet he would cup  Like he would sit Sam  In his lap 
[03:48:30]  And like as he would  Like just kind of cup  Sam's balls a little bit  He would cradle Sam's head  And put Sam's mouth  Onto his hairy man nipple  And make Sam nurse  Come on Sam  Come on  Come get fed Sam  Come get fed  He would feed you  From his nipple  These stories are doing something  Cause now it's 89 degrees  In studio  Alright  Thank you young Sam  Oh yeah you're welcome  We're trying to get the fuck  Out of here  Let's do line of the day  Brought to you by  Card Scan  You know

[03:55:30]  My mispronunciation started  Miss Kuntz  I couldn't say  Mrs. Kuntz's name right  You should have said  Mrs. K  And her name was Anita  That's insane  Huh  Miss K  Miss Snatch  And her husband's name was  Dick  And I swear  No way  That's parents with a sense of humor  Dick  Dick cunts  Dick cunts  Jesus  Yeah the cunts  Maybe they were hunters  Dick hunts  Dick hunts  Right  Very good Jimmy  Thanks  They had a son named Mike
