<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and Jimmy Norton's usual irreverent banter, which quickly devolved into a discussion about the disturbing imagery found on Ogresh.com, showcasing graphic photos of mutilated bodies.  Producer Steve then joined, explaining the morbid fascination surrounding such content, noting the difference in reaction between color and black and white images of crime scenes. The conversation then shifted to the previous day's show featuring Mary Carey and Tawny Roberts, criticizing the overwhelmingly offensive listener call-in responses during the "Serious Questions Only" segment.  The hosts recounted Mary Carey's drunken and emotional behavior during and after the show, detailing the reactions of other restaurant patrons to her appearance.  Further lighthearted anecdotes followed, including Jim Norton mistaking Jane Fonda, a funny phone gag involving Opie's backpack, a waiter's unusual wig, and a sighting of Eric LaSalle. Opie shared a story about his germophobia, exacerbated by handling a hotel keycard and the sight of his co-hosts' potentially unwashed hands after a guest possibly carrying lice.  The show then focused on the laziness of their unpaid interns (Nathaniel, Danny, and Derek), contrasting them with the diligence of Travis, whom they encouraged to tattletale.  A caller, Lewis, criticized Jimmy Norton's interrupting, while another, Bill, relayed negative comments from the Booker show on K-Rock. The segment concluded with a commercial for XM Satellite Radio and plans for a listener-participatory segment comparing their show to others nationwide, along with brief mentions of news items concerning Paula Abdul, Jessica Simpson, and Bill Cosby.

A significant portion of the broadcast involved a heated argument between Opie and Jim Norton.  The core conflict stemmed from Norton's criticism of Opie's perceived mishandling of comedian Sean Rouse's appearance, accusing Opie of a "blow-off."  This escalated into a broader discussion of the show's treatment of other comedians (Bill Burr and Patrice O'Neal were mentioned), its booking practices, particularly regarding porn stars (Yoshi and a "Slap Happy" guest were also mentioned), and broader managerial issues.  Opie defended his actions, citing the constraints of live radio and his ultimate authority as host.  The argument became increasingly aggressive and insulting, with both hosts employing offensive language.  The discussion also touched on marketing and advertising shortcomings, with Norton voicing his concerns.  Chris Jericho and Ben (whose role was unclear) were present in studio, along with Jay Moore who later entered naked. Anthony attempted to mediate, highlighting the underlying tension and suggesting they resolve their issues off-air.

Another argument, this time between Opie and Anthony, followed. Opie voiced his desire to reduce negativity, focusing on the issue of guests waiting outside the studio, while Anthony defended his actions and the show's direction. Insults and accusations of "throwing the other under the bus" with Hugh Pinero were exchanged, ending with Opie's concession.  This was followed by a listener's expletive-laden rant directed at various individuals and entities, including the show, SiriusXM, and other media personalities.  The broadcast then featured clips from news broadcasts covering their on-air argument, followed by the introduction of Jay Moore and Sean Rouse, along with several women, including Hillary, a porn actress from "Facial Extravaganza" and "Slap Happy" films.  The segment largely centered on graphic descriptions and clips from Hillary's pornography, detailing sexual acts, ejaculation, cleanup processes, and the director's alleged unusual behavior.  Brandon Irons was frequently mentioned, and further graphic descriptions and clips from other pornographic films were shown, along with a brief discussion of potential health risks like hepatitis. The conversation was punctuated with highly offensive language and sexual innuendo.

The subsequent segment continued the graphic descriptions of pornography and sexual acts. Opie, Anthony, Jay Moore, Yoshi, and Hillary engaged in sexually explicit conversations, referencing specific pornographic videos and scenarios.  The planned "double penetration" scenario involving Hillary was discussed. Other topics included Jay Moore's upcoming movie, speculation about Paula Abdul's drug use (based on audio clips), a phone call interrupted by Fran concerning Jay Moore and the porn actress, and anecdotes about Yoshi's arrest for carrying a collapsible baton and his stand-up career.  The hosts discussed their personal preferences regarding pornography and introduced a product called "O&A Party Rock."  Numerous off-color jokes were made, frequently targeting different ethnic groups.

The final segment revolved heavily around strippers, using audio clips from a 2020 expos√©. Opie, Anthony, and guest Bill Burr used vulgar language discussing stereotypes, dynamics between strippers and customers, and financial aspects. Callers "Flower Boy" and "Tom" shared anecdotes about significant spending at strip clubs.  Other unrelated topics included a teacher accused of having sex with a student, a helicopter crash in Iraq, Miss Puerto Rico's arrest, and Jimmy Norton's upcoming HBO special.  A significant portion focused on Jimmy Norton's flatulence, leading to crude jokes.  The show also touched upon the challenges of television production, using Jay Moore's anecdotes about union regulations on Last Comic Standing.  Numerous discussions about sexual acts and preferences, with explicit descriptions and language, concluded the broadcast.

[00:03:30]  Somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  Down syndrome children.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  During the early 90s. 
[00:04:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  I want you to do so many things.  We'll be right back.  I want you to do so many things.  I said, you gon' fuck me out of the head.  God damn, he said, you gon' fuck me out of the head.  I was like, F you, you motherfucker.  He said, fuck you, you son of a fucking fuck. 
[00:05:00]  He said, you goddamn motherfucker.  Yeah, I was like, fuck you.  Oh dear, oh dear.  You will be molested.  Ah, yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole. 
[00:05:30]  You found me incompetent.  Yes.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, okay, terrific.  It's Friday, yes.  I don't want to work.  You're supposed to do that?  Play the whole montage?  The medley of Friday songs?  Everybody working for the week. 
[00:06:00]  How many stupid radio stations out there do that still?  The same old crap.  I guarantee it.  I guarantee it.  That's like 80s.  That was the 80s.  Everybody working for the...  Really?  Yeah, they're working for the weekend.  Why is Jim pounding the table already?  Come on, get through this one.  With me.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I'm looking at Ogresh Magazine.  Have you looked at this?  No, I haven't looked yet. 
[00:06:30]  It's the most revolting photographs I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, well, if you go to the website, what is that, Ogresh.com?  Oh, my God, dude.  Yeah, so they put out a magazine, and I shan't be looking through it.  Well, that was Steve's deal there.  I'm not a big fan of disgusting websites and photographs and disturbing images.  I like your sex.  I like the sexual images, things like that.  Oh, well, you don't even have to show me something. 
[00:07:00]  I'm looking at the back page, and...  This is a picture of a guy who was in a car, accidentally got hit by a train, and his face  is off, and his brains are where his face should be, leaking out the front of his head.  Jesus.  Why?  I can't stop looking at Ogresh.  Don't look at it.  It makes you sick.  It does.  It's really...  It's just the...  You see the new footage they have now of the guy that these fucking animals executing  in the pilot?  Oh, yeah.  The helicopter pilot?  I heard that on WINS today. 
[00:07:30]  It's just disturbing.  A civilian...  Well, it was a bunch of security workers and some Americans on this helicopter in Iraq.  It crashes, and apparently they just got some video of these animals.  There was a guy out in the field, I guess one of the survivors, and he was asking for  help or something.  He's like, help me up.  Give me your hand, man.  Give me your hand.  I saw it.  It's awful.  Oh, you saw it?  Yeah.  He's like, give me your hand.  And the guy said something to him.  He goes, it's broken.  It's broken.  I guess his foot or something was broken. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And they're like, go, go.  So they act like they're letting him go.  So he stands up, and he starts to kind of like walk through this grassy field.  He's wearing this blue jumper.  And you hear the gun cock, and the guy kind of like puts his hand up in a defensive motion.  And they just shoot him, of course, a lock bar, of course.  That's what they do.  They started chanting that?  Every video, that's what they chant at the end.  God, I hate them.  They're just awful.  They're awful animalistic people. 
[00:08:30]  Animals.  Yuck.  Where's Steve?  I want to talk.  Oh, my God.  I want to talk about Ogre.  It looks like a butcher shop.  I'm getting.  The one page just looked like it was taken at a butcher.  I'm just trying to see where.  Okay.  Yeah.  Whoa.  This picture is actually not that bad.  See this one?  I like testing where my line is from time to time.  That one's not bad at all.  Let me see which one.  This is.  Oh, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[00:09:00]  I'm getting like.  Oh, that's cool.  I'm almost ready to puke, and I'm not even kidding.  And I can handle a lot.  I don't even.  It's a butchered body on an autopsy table, I guess.  They're trying to figure out what happened to this dude, and his head is just sitting there.  And the rest of his body looks just like chop meat, raw chop meat all over the place.  You can't even figure out any body parts in this photo.  It's too disturbing.  Holy crap.  I like testing my limit, my line, and wow, there it is.  Because the rest of this I was fine with. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  I was fine.  And I noticed, Anthony, that foundrymusic.com is proudly advertised in ogre mag.  Jesus, man.  Hold on there, buddy.  All right, go ahead, Steve.  You're on.  Yeah, yeah.  I started talking to the Ogresh guys a couple months ago, actually.  And I guess, and it was because a lot of this stuff, Jimmy was talking about what's coming  from Ogresh.  Ben loves the site.  Ben loves the site? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  He's always on it.  He's always on it, watching the Al-Qaeda videos.  And it's just, it's gruesome.  I really don't have the stomach for it.  Well, Ben has no fear of a beheading, because I don't have weapons I can cut through.  The war will be over by the time they got through.  Oh, look, boy.  Oh, look, boy.  Oh, look, boy.  Oh, look, boy.  Oh, look, boy.  Oh, fuck, they found it.  I've been lying.  He was doing a coconut.  That's right.  That's right.  Oh, Brady.  They got to get the Forrester's saw for Ben's head. 
[00:10:30]  The two-man saw.  A lot of the files that the ONA fans said didn't come from Ogresh.  So it's just, I started talking to these guys.  They're fans.  They're international, too.  One of the guys is in the Netherlands.  Another guy's in Texas.  And it's just this morbid fascination that people have with this weird effed-up stuff.  Yeah, some.  Not everybody.  I can't look at this stuff.  It's too, like, the images just burn into your head. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And you see them even after you put the magazine away.  Well.  So I can't.  Here's the deal with me.  When you go into some of these bookstores, they have little coffee table books.  L.A. Crime Scenes, I think, is one or something like that.  And they have black-and-white photos that they finally have released from old crimes in the L.A. area.  See, that I could deal with.  For some reason, you can get as gross as you want if it's a black-and-white photo, and you know it's old.  Black Dahlia. 
[00:11:30]  You see that one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cut her in half.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's a sick one.  But when it's in color, and you know it's relatively recent, for some reason, I get squeamish.  That is a graphic, graphic magazine, man.  Yeah.  In living color.  Good luck.  Dead color.  Good luck to these guys, but I'm not supporting them.  I'm sorry, Steve.  Yeah, whatever.  It's quite all right.  You know what?  You want to look at that stuff, great.  No, I'm all for it.  It's great.  This is a news week.  This is just like Newsweek without the fucking, without the bullshit filter.  This is what goes on in the world. 
[00:12:00]  It's pretty.  Headings and pretty accurate.  And you know, it's a lot of the same audience, so yeah, we worked it out.  And they've got thousands of people internationally.  So I said, hey, tell them all about the O&A show and all that stuff.  So they're cool guys.  Steve is like a kingpin of the internet.  You know that, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's becoming one of the guys.  Absolutely.  I'm working.  I'm working on it.  He's not going to stop until he's the number one internet guy out there.  Well, he's got some competition.  I do.  I just don't have, I don't have the 6,000 square foot mansion on a bluff yet, but I'm working on it. 
[00:12:30]  See, the Google guys just, their earnings came in and it was six times more than what was expected.  They went up huge in the, what is that, overnight trading.  And when the market opens, forget about it.  Google's just going to shoot up through the roof.  Those guys got to be pulling in $400,000 or $500,000 a year each.  Maybe more.  Maybe more than that, Jim. 
[00:13:00]  Because a lot more than that, Jim.  Hey, what do you got on the website today, Steve, for everyone to check out?  We got the photos of Mary Carey and Tawny Roberts yesterday.  Oh, I did see those.  And yeah, we got four clips from Tippy Tom.  Going to do more over the weekend.  Anybody itching or anything from yesterday?  Yeah.  Because I know you guys, like Eric and Ben, were really close to him a couple of times.  And I know some people were sitting in his chair, he was sitting in a scratch in his head.  And I was quite fearful that perhaps some of his bugs may have jumped onto us. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  So no Eric, no itching.  Good.  You don't have video of him scratching his head real hard?  I'm sure I do.  It'll be up.  It'll be up.  There's just a lot of it.  There's three videotapes that we have to go through.  You can go to foundrymusic.com if you know how to spell.  Or go to opianthony.com if you don't know how to spell.  Yeah.  Because opianthony, that's easier to spell, right?  Yeah, right.  Although they...  You should see what people try to spell.  I know.  They misspell my name all the time, so...  It's O-P-I-A-N-T-O-N-Y.  No, no, no. 
[00:14:00]  It's O-P-I-E and anthony.com.  I like the people that spell it O-P-Y.  That's funny.  And O-P-E-Y and D-O-P-E-Y.  Can't quite figure it out.  Speaking of yesterday, I got to...  We should talk about this because we talked about it after the show.  Kind of disappointed in the listeners yesterday during the...  In the Mary Carey, Tawny segment.  You know, we went to an old bit called Serious Questions Only. 
[00:14:30]  And when we were on commercial radio, that's your cue to, you know, kind of attack the guest.  But in this case...  Well, I should say, when we did it on commercial radio, you guys would call in with real clever stuff that really, you know, hit home.  You know what I mean?  So we went with the bit yesterday and the C word.  One after another.  And it was just...  It just stunk.  It just...  It wasn't...  It wasn't clever.  It was just awful.  That's part of this satellite radio thing.  I understand.  People got to realize that just because you can say it, you know, to then just blurt it out. 
[00:15:00]  Look, man, I have no problem if you want to use the C word on this show from time to time.  But, you know, pick your spots, man.  We could have had a lot more fun with that bit yesterday than just going right at them with the C word.  My God.  Because her being annoyed that Ant called her...  Like, Ant just said, ah, you seem a little drunk this morning.  Her being annoyed or upset at that was annoying.  So, like, teasing her about being a drunk was funny because she was being a little bit kind of a prima donna about it. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And she was drunk.  She was.  Of course she was.  And that was the bit, too, by the way, to just keep going with that angle.  And blaming Anthony, which was great because she would talk and I would go drunk and she would look up and I would look at him like, you motherfucker.  Yeah.  And that was funny, but it's like...  He's staring me down thinking I said it.  Exactly.  It was beautiful because she was so hot.  He didn't want to get her pissed off at him.  Nah.  But then when you just call up when she's already, like, a little bit wounded, you should have called up with drunk stuff.  You can't just call up and go, are you crying because your father touched you, you cunt?  It's like, Jesus Christ.  I know.  Dude, I was cringing.  Yeah.  It's like, oof. 
[00:16:00]  Hold on, though.  I don't even mind if they want to do that.  But, I mean, in that case, you know, you went for the simple way.  That's all I'm saying.  And no one...  We try not to go with the obvious.  We really try not to.  We try to, you know, weave our way and try to, you know, stay clever.  And no one at NXM complains.  I don't think that people...  Oh, the bosses must have...  Nobody complained about the bit.  We didn't get any calls from Logan.  We just kind of talked about it after the show.  It's like, you know, shitting on somebody is one thing.  But, man, when...  You know, just...  I don't know.  Attacking like that, I was like, come on, man.  There was no need for it. 
[00:16:30]  She fully admitted to being a, quote-unquote, drunk porno whore when she was cutting liners.  Right.  And we have them all.  So, it's just...  I just thought we could have been more clever with it.  That's all.  I'm not trying to tell you guys not to, you know, call in with the C word and blah, blah,  blah.  But...  We saw them afterwards, after the show, in the restaurant over at the Parker.  Parker Meridian.  Yeah.  And they're sitting there having lunch, whatever time it was.  I don't know.  And they get up to leave and, like, every guy in there...  There's guys with their wives and stuff. 
[00:17:00]  And they're sitting at the tables, just turned around and stared at her ass in those jeans.  The low-cut jeans.  Just staring.  All the wives getting angry.  And she had her sunglasses on.  Apparently, she was still crying at the table.  Yeah.  She is just a mess, that girl.  She is a mess.  That girl is a mess.  That was the truth.  Just an emotional wreck.  But that's something attractive.  Like, she's so beautiful.  Are you...  She's so...  Her facial structure, her eyes...  I mean, I never look at chicks' eyes.  I don't care if they have them. 
[00:17:30]  She is so beautiful.  She would ruin you in a weekend, without even banging you.  Yeah.  She would hang out with you.  If she just kissed your face a little, and, like, let you hug her when she was sad, you're  fucking finished.  You're done.  You're done.  I wouldn't even have to have sex with that girl.  All of a sudden, you're giving her your PIN number.  You're just...  I'm doing it.  My ATM.  For your ATM card.  Honey, take those tears away.  Go to Bank of America.  Get yourself a little something nice.  Whatever you need.  I trust you.  Here's my PIN number.  Oh, make that your girlfriend? 
[00:18:00]  Dude, but you'd want to hug her, because she was crying.  She wasn't...  She was being irrational, but she wasn't being vicious.  She was irrational and hurt, and you were like, ugh, she's just a bit of a mess today.  And you wanted to just hug her and kiss her on the cheek.  I'm fucking sap.  The funny part is...  You are a sap.  The funny part is, as you're moving out of your really nice apartment, because she took  you for everything, you'd still be holding her and trying to take care of her.  That's okay.  Cuddling her.  Sitting in the car, hoping that she'd be like, oh, thank you, Ricky.  That was...  Wow, all right, cool.  You walk in, huddle, huddle, huddle, she's just going at some guy. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, she's like, oh, what happened?  What's that between your teeth?  Eh, I don't want to know.  Let me play this real fast.  Hey, this is Tawny Roberts, and you're listening to my little pal, Jimmy Norton.  It was great.  Jesus Christ.  What a drunk.  Well, no, that's Mary Carey knowing that she just has to, like, shout encouragement at her  the whole time.  I mean, the slurring.  Yeah, she just needs to be encouraged.  By the way, if you missed yesterday's show, we replay all the shows during the weekend on  this channel.  So, for the new listeners, you can catch up a little bit. 
[00:19:00]  How great was Mary Carey yesterday?  What a team player.  Just take the headphones off, and they can't hear you.  Mary is a team player.  Yeah.  One other thing I got to mention at breakfast, Jim's, you know, celebrity photo obsession,  he was convinced that Jane Fonda was there.  And he wouldn't take no for an answer.  I'm like, that's not Jane Fonda.  What a, what a, oh, it just, it interrupted our lunch every two seconds.  Like, you're trying to read the menu, and every two seconds, that's her, right? 
[00:19:30]  Isn't that Jane Fonda?  I'm glad you get to, you got to see it for yourself, Anthony.  This happens all the time.  And Scott Farrell was having breakfast with us yesterday, and he worked in Atlanta.  And he knows, he's seen Jane Fonda a lot, because he, he works in the, um, the CNN building.  The CNN building.  And I see her every day, pretty much.  So, he turned around, looked, and within a second, he went, no, that's not her.  Absolutely not.  Not her.  She's shorter.  She's got more wrinkles.  She's not that thin.  She, like, he just had, had it all lined up as why, why that wasn't. 
[00:20:00]  But for the whole time, Jimmy was like, I don't know.  It looks like her.  It did though.  And then he does this thing that's so annoying.  The waiter, a waitress, or hostess will come over to the table, and Jimmy will point at me and go,  he thinks that's Jane Fonda.  Is it?  Because he keeps saying, it's her, and I just, I look and go, I didn't ask.  Because now I've got to explain myself, and I feel all awkward.  No, I'm not asking.  He is, but he's pointing at me.  They don't understand.  You got off easy.  Because they're looking right at me now and going, no, I don't think it's her. 
[00:20:30]  You got off easy.  Don't look at me.  A lot of times, he'll tell the waiter that he's not happy with his food.  And then they have to explain you are happy with your food, and then Jim's like, no, tell him what you were telling him.  No, I'm fine.  Just tell him.  He's fine with it.  He's just goofing.  He's going, is everything okay?  And they still follow through.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't hear you at all saying, no, he's the asshole.  I'm fine.  I'm happy with the food.  They're like, you okay?  Because we can get you something.  No.  Everything's fine.  Jimmy is a nudge.  I thought my phone gag was pretty good. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, oh, the phone in Opie's backpack?  It was just ringing.  It's ringing.  And he kept turning around, like, looking for the phone.  Going, I think you have a phone ringing.  And he had three people at the restaurant going, I think it's yours.  I think what?  And I would turn around, I'm like, no, it's coming from the co-check.  It's over there.  So then they walked over to the co-check to make sure their phone wasn't ringing.  I thought it was pretty good.  You actually got me really good, too, because I thought it was on the co-check, and it was  just yours.  You silly goose.  And then you got the waiter with that weird wig.  That waiter, I don't know what that is on his head.  It's the worst wig anybody's ever worn, including Halloween. 
[00:21:30]  It was a divot.  Norton got me so bad the first time we saw that waiter, because, you know, we're over  there, you know, I guess we're there a lot.  And I go, Norton, I think that guy's wearing a wig.  He looks at me and goes, you think?  It really is the worst wig.  It's fucking horrible.  It should have, like, a Mets logo on the front of it.  But you will get a nicer wig around Halloween for your Frankenstein costume. 
[00:22:00]  He's like an androgynous guy, and he has a batting helmet on with hair on it.  We really don't know what he is.  I can't tell if it's a woman or a man.  I cannot tell.  It comes by.  It's got, like, baloney tits, but it could be regular, you know, tits, because he, she  is fat.  But there's no real sign of facial hair, but, but there's a guy thing going on there.  I can't figure it out.  And by the way, there was a celebrity there yesterday. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  Eric LaSalle.  Eric LaSalle.  ER.  Yeah, I told you.  The black guy from ER.  ER.  And I recognize him.  Not a lot of things, but.  I was going to get the picture.  I'm like, eh, who's going to come take it?  No one would take it.  And I was like, well, it wasn't a big enough one for me to go crazy and beg.  But then I remember he was coming to America.  I'm like, fuck.  Yeah, the Jerry Curl.  Oh.  Well, the worst is Jim's like, you know, will you take the picture?  And sometimes I do.  But it's just awkward, because the guy who's already leaving the restaurant, I have to follow  Jimmy with the camera all set and ready to go.  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's got to be a natural environment. 
[00:23:00]  Well, I also, the only reason I didn't get up immediately, I saw him at the podium.  I didn't know if he was coming in or leaving, and I wouldn't have got him if he was coming  in.  And then I had a dilemma, which you guys, of course, jumped on me about.  And I had to use the restroom, so you have to go to the coat check and get an actual hotel  room key card to use the bathroom downstairs.  So I get that.  I go downstairs, use the bathroom.  Then I'm washing my hands, as I always do, Opie, because, you know, if you're in the bathroom, 
[00:23:30]  you've got to wash your hands when you're done.  Sure.  Then I'm looking at the key card, going, you know, a lot of guys probably just use this  card, they take a leak, they grab their cheese dick, and then grab that card and bring it  back up to the coat check, girl.  And right now, by proxy, I'm touching cock.  Well, you're exactly right.  That's why the card looks so greasy.  Yeah, it does.  It looks all greasy.  It's nasty.  It is. 
[00:24:00]  It's disgusting.  So I don't know what I've got to do.  And then I didn't want to grab the key card with a paper towel and then hand it back to  the woman in a paper towel.  And why?  I don't really know.  I know why.  You don't want to reveal what a psychopath you're turning into.  Perhaps that's it.  That's true telling.  I'm so glad we're onto this final.  Perhaps that's it.  I've been working with Anthony for 10 years.  I had no idea.  He looks at me at the table.  Are you done with your little card?  No, no, no, because I've got to tell you how I solved the problem.  I'm washing my hands and I'm looking at the card. 
[00:24:30]  And then I realized I had an answer.  I knew what to do.  I grabbed the card, put it in my soapy hand, got some more soap on it, and washed the card  in my hands.  I washed the card, rinsed it off, dried it very well, and now the card was clean.  Well, who suggested you do that?  Was it McMurphy or Chief?  Jesus Christ.  But I'll tell you, when I handed the card back to the coat check girl, she grabbed it 
[00:25:00]  between her thumb and forefinger by the edges.  Like, she knows.  She knows what that card, where that card is.  You know how much feces and urine is probably on that card?  You're really losing it.  I'm not.  You really are.  I'm not over the top with this.  This is basic stuff that anybody who's slightly concerned that, you know, you're going to be  eating.  I'm going to be eating!  I'm sitting down in front of food!  I don't want some guy's dick hairs that were on this card on my fingers before I eat. 
[00:25:30]  How is that crazy?  Well, then you looked at me.  That's where the craziness comes in.  And we're getting ready to dig in and have our breakfast.  And you looked at me and went, go to the bathroom!  Yes.  That's what you said, though.  You go, go to the bathroom!  I go, what?  And Anthony goes, look at your hands.  They're filthy.  Go wash them now!  They were.  I'm like, what is wrong with you?  Your hands were dirty.  And it wasn't so much that your hands were dirty. 
[00:26:00]  Your hands being dirty told me that you hadn't washed them since you did the show.  The fact that Tippy fucking Tom was in here, and you were then touching the door handle,  other things that Tom was touching, and then you're going to eat?  That's insanity!  They were dirty.  That's insanity!  They were dirty because a pen exploded.  So, you know, there was ink on my hands here and there.  But I'm not talking about the ink.  The ink wasn't what bothered me.  But, dude, the funny part was you didn't say casually.  You were like, look at your hands! 
[00:26:30]  I'm like, what?  Yes, I was very...  What, Mom?  Oh, Jesus!  I was shocked that you would sit down and eat after yesterday's show with the mess that  was in here.  And then Jimmy and I, you know, were on to, you know, Ant's quirk there yesterday.  Oh, you bastard.  So then we're getting, like, just uncomfortably close with our hands.  You know what you guys are doing?  I'm sitting in between the two of them.  So they start reaching.  They're talking to each other.  And you know how sometimes you would reach over and maybe touch someone's arm to get  their attention?  You guys are reaching over my placemat and my silverware with all these filthy hands. 
[00:27:00]  I'm caressing you.  I'm like, what is his shirt made out of?  I'm just feeling his biceps.  Touching me.  But that doesn't bother me.  It really doesn't.  We were feeling his clothes.  Wow, this is a nice material.  That doesn't bother me.  You hate being touched.  I don't like being touched, but it doesn't bother me where I got to go, I'm eating and  I'm clean.  I'm sterile.  Get away.  You know, I'm not that kooky.  Not yet.  I'm not crazy.  I am at, I like knowing that I don't have tippy-tomf mites on my hands when I'm going 
[00:27:30]  to dig into some luscious breakfast.  I know you're onto something because I do get sick a lot and it's probably because I  don't wash my hands as well as I should.  You're constantly getting colds.  And I go to the doctor and he says I'm beyond healthy.  My numbers were great.  Take germy finger, put it in your nose, you're going to get sick.  So, you know, there you have it.  I want to just see how the Opie and Anthony show works with Opie doing the studio show  here and Ant right in a suite with an ISDN line in the sands eating ice cream that he  had specially made. 
[00:28:00]  Fucking Mormons looking out for him.  What's wrong with that?  That sounds like a pleasant, nice way to live.  More and more like Howard Hughes.  I noticed you're dressed really nice again today.  Nothing too crazy, but I'm starting to think that you're buying new.  I do have my dress socks on.  I see.  You got the dress socks.  I'm starting to think that you're buying a lot of brand new clothes and only wearing  the clothes once.  And then I throw them away.  Because we all notice. 
[00:28:30]  They do get dirty.  We all notice everyone's rotation here, man.  I got like three or four things I wear here.  That's it.  I'm not dressing up for you fucks.  I blame you.  And Jimmy wears the same New York hoodie every day, zip-up hoodie.  And you have something on different every single day.  I haven't seen it rotate around yet.  Clothes can collect germs even after the wash.  So what you have to do is take them down to the local incinerator and actually burn them 
[00:29:00]  and then buy new clothes.  I just, I have a heavy rotation.  You have a very large rotation.  Extremely large.  Like I said, I only wear clothes once before they're washed.  How many pairs of jeans have you?  That doesn't have any, but by the way, that doesn't have anything to do with any cleanliness  or germ thing.  That's just the fact that my girlfriend does a very good job with the laundry.  And I would, believe me, I would be on the clothes on the floor.  I'd pick them right up and put them on. 
[00:29:30]  But I don't.  The second they're on the floor, they're gone.  They're washed and hung up in the closet.  My jeans.  Fifth day in a row, boys and girls.  Thank you.  That's going to be nice.  It's your rollerblading swamp bag.  I know.  Don't you have swamp ass?  No, I change the underwear and the socks.  That's the key.  And I do the sniff test every morning.  There's no smells yet.  You smell the ass crack?  But I do give up.  Friday's the day I throw it in the laundry.  Ooh.  Friday's the day.  Friday's the day, huh? 
[00:30:00]  So since we've been back from vacation, I've worn two pairs of jeans.  Thank you.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You've gone through like a closet full.  Unbelievable.  How do you do the laundry?  Do you go down to the laundromat?  Do you send it out?  Yeah, I just don't do it all.  Do you go to the laundromat?  Oh, my God, yeah.  It's the greatest luxury ever.  Where is it?  It's right on my corner.  It is?  So you put it all in a big bag?  They weigh it and I'm done.  Oh, wait.  They ask me if I want to like separate the colors. 
[00:30:30]  I'm like, no.  So you don't physically put it in the machine yourself?  No.  Okay, you drop it off.  I've never done laundry.  I used to.  Well, I used to back in the older days.  Well, actually, I did a little bit during my early 20s and stuff.  There was, remember that place Splinters in Greenlaw in the bar?  There was a laundromat right next door to it.  And laundry would take me six hours because I would be hammered in the bar.  And you'd come out and your clothes are sitting in the dryer all wrinkled because you left 
[00:31:00]  them there for three hours while you got hammered.  Nice.  Now that was doing laundry.  All right, everyone's got their food.  We're ready to go.  That was quick.  I guess Ricky had to go.  Yeah, that was quick.  I think he went out on a fishing boat and caught my tuna and then came back.  Unbelievable how it takes him so long.  The guy took this order well before the show started in the office.  Ricky, I got to ask you.  And not even like, damn it, my food isn't here quick enough. 
[00:31:30]  This is just out of pure curiosity.  Yeah.  What takes you so long from the time you take the order well before the show is going  to start in the office to come back with everything and we've already started the show?  625, you called me.  I got a phone call at home.  What would you like?  Egg white omelet, egg white western omelet and an apple.  That's what I want.  Yeah, I was getting other orders after yours.  And then after that, I got to the deli and I ordered three omelets. 
[00:32:00]  And that took a while too because they only got two and then they skipped Steve's.  So I had to wait an extra couple of minutes to get Steve's omelet.  Dude, could you swallow your food before you talk?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Between the braces and a little thin thing that could be a mustache.  And a little caterpillar mustache.  These nachos are good.  He's got the butthead braces, man.  He gets the butthead lifts sometimes.  Did he just try to do an impression?  No, he was actually laughing?  No, I was.  Very good.  Can we just beat you up? 
[00:32:30]  Throw the intern a beating day.  Oh my God, it would make me so happy.  Wow.  Oh, God damn.  No.  It just seems to take you longer than anybody else to get stuff.  I don't know what it is.  Do you kind of just, I don't know, saunter to the store?  If I may use the word saunter?  Yes.  No.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Sashay.  No?  You kind of, is it a brisk pace?  Brisk pace, I would say, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  And then you get there and is there a line?  No, not really.  You're the first guy at the counter.  No, not usually.  Maybe like one or two dudes.  One or two.  So it's coffee.  That's all.  It just seems, we have to have someone follow him one day.  It just gives us a report.  I was going to get everything like separated before, you know, I go out because I wanted  everybody's orders separate so I can give the food out faster.  You know that Travis kicks your ass, right?  Yeah.  6-25, I got a call.  7-15, you walked in with food.  That's 50 minutes. 
[00:33:30]  Wow.  All right.  Well, enjoy your time here.  Jesus.  I started growling.  You're going to hear it on mic.  Like, wow.  Like, who has different orders?  What did we have this morning?  Ann had his tuna sandwich.  There was four different baked egg and cheeses, one in a sesame seed.  We should have an Oakland Anthony gift shop for interns like this.  Yeah.  So they have something to remember us by.  Like at Disney, you go on the ride, and then the ride lets out in that ride's gift shop. 
[00:34:00]  A lot of these guys are going.  So when you're leaving, you can get like a Star Tours hat.  A lot of these guys are going places.  And then there's other people like Ricky.  We need a gift shop for, so they have something to remember us by.  So when they leave the attraction, it's kind of that.  There's something to remember us by at all.  You go through your dresser, and you have that shirt from, you know, the Mickey Mouse shirt from Disney when you went there in 1998.  You could get a Pirates of the Caribbean eye patch.  Then you get a nice little, like, warm feeling remembering your time.  Yeah.  Where there's a photo of him walking out of your office with his hands above his head like you get on a roller coaster. 
[00:34:30]  Right, right.  Like he's on a little roller coaster or something.  I heart, and those two awful caricatures on a mug.  Enjoy your time, Ricky.  Enjoy your time.  Take it all in.  Thank you, Ricky.  Take it all in.  There he goes.  No problem.  Soak it up.  There he goes.  There's Ricky.  Look at the room.  Ophie, look at the room.  They are roaring in there.  Roaring with laughter.  Dumber than a box of rocks. 
[00:35:00]  They love it.  I don't consider those guys interns, though.  Well, the one.  What's his name over there?  Which one?  He gets paid.  Which one?  The one that gets paid.  Oh, Derek.  I know him.  Ever since he went on his salary, I learned his name.  Derek.  Wait, that one's Derek?  Yeah.  Yes.  I didn't know.  Oh, my God.  I thought the tall one was Derek.  No, no, no.  See, one of them is Nathaniel.  The other is Danny, but I get them mixed up.  But I know those two, Nathaniel and Danny, I just consider employees that don't get paid.  Right.  That's what I consider them.  I don't consider them interns. 
[00:35:30]  They're like employees that don't get paid.  I've been telling them that you and I are giving them a check for that clever ruse.  For the last two months.  Is that actually working?  They're still believing it.  I love their expectations.  They get like, wow, this is great.  And then you just, the check never shows up.  Well, they start as interns and they're still technically interns, but they're working for  us pretty much full time.  So, so, and I got together and said, it would be nice to give them a little check, a little  thank you check.  Dude, I fed Nathaniel that line of shit at the Hard Rock appearance.  How long ago was that?  That's a, how long ago was that? 
[00:36:00]  That was St. Paddy's Day.  St. Paddy's Day.  I told him, dude, we're going to cut this check for you.  It's going to be great.  It's going to take a little while.  And it just has gone on and on and their expectations are there and the check never shows.  Dude, it's a long process.  I mean, you actually have to call Bob and go, Nathaniel, amount, send.  Well, it's time to do that.  You're busy people.  I really do feel bad.  I pretended that Bob was on a Hawaiian vacation.  Oh, that's what's going on.  That's why he couldn't cut the check.  Bob was in town yesterday.  He could have opened his briefcase. 
[00:36:30]  He was sitting there on the couch.  There was glass separating them and Bob.  Oh, that's awful.  We were supposed to take them to the Hard Rock.  We were going to take them, remember, for Christmas.  Yeah.  October, November, December, they did three months of hard work.  Well, we had to take the interns out and do something nice for them.  And as the holidays start to roll around, eh, fuck them, January.  We'll talk to them in January.  I had holiday traffic.  Very busy man.  I jumped on my roller blaze.  I want to get home before the rest of the traffic going through Central Park.  We used terrorist techniques.  You would get dressed. 
[00:37:00]  You'll go home today.  And then the guy gets dressed.  They bring him the suit he was captured in.  And then you lead him outside.  You take him in a Jeep.  You drive him around a little.  And then he goes, wait, wait, this is back to the prison.  No, you said I was going home.  Back in the hall.  You put him back.  And then like a week later, good news.  Today you go home.  Give him the suit again.  You get checked.  Keeps him in line.  You get checked today.  Check coming.  You get checked today.  I'm getting paid today.  Bob, no send check. 
[00:37:30]  Not today.  Happily get checked tomorrow.  Matter of fact, our super agent, Bobby Eatman, will be stopping by before he flies back to L.A. today.  Oh, today again.  He has checked today for you.  My friend, you get checked today.  Watch the polite head nod he gets when you introduce him.  We got to give these guys a check.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Sure.  The polite head nod.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take our first break here.  We got lots to do.  We got to talk about Paula Abdul.  Jay Morris coming in. 
[00:38:00]  Jessica Simpson is banging Johnny Knoxville, it looks like.  Allegedly.  I guess, right?  I didn't read that.  Or so they say.  The gossip.  Cosby facing more accusations.  More groping accusations.  Woman who claimed finger in her Wendy's food is arrested.  That whole lie.  If you're going to claim that a restaurant had something in your food and you're suing them,  it should be the first time you sue anybody.  Cos if you have this history of suing people, they're going to investigate it. 
[00:38:30]  And then it turns out the finger was suspicious.  Could have been from her dead aunt, I hear.  Oh, my God.  This story just has it all.  Can we get into it next?  I haven't even read all the details on that one.  It's a good one.  Hey, you guys want to span the country today?  Spanning the globe.  Span the country and see what other morning shows are doing?  We haven't done this bit in a while.  I like this one.  Yes.  Listeners get involved with this, too.  Yeah, Jimmy, you... 
[00:39:00]  We need them.  They're integral to this bit.  I've never been here for this bit.  Well, you were the inspiration for this bit because we...  Travis.  You were down in Baltimore.  I like that boy.  On that show that...  Oh, I like those guys.  Kirk Mark and Lopez and 98 Rock in Baltimore.  You know what, though?  They were the only radio station that sent a cease and desist.  Cease and desist.  It wasn't them, though.  They don't want us, you know...  It's not them.  ...airing any of their material on satellite radio.  Guarantee you not them.  They were the only one, and we had like 20 shows on that morning.  I'm just saying. 
[00:39:30]  That's what happened.  That's their lawyer.  But, yeah, you were the inspiration for this bit.  You were on that morning show.  We decided to listen in.  It was really good radio.  It was a lot of fun to listen to.  And then we said, ah, let's see what other morning shows are doing today.  And then our listeners from all over the country picked out their local, pretty much  hokey, hacky morning show.  They put it on the radio.  They call us up.  They put their cell phone right up against the speaker.  And we had to listen in on their morning show, their popular morning show.  So you guys were counting on you today. 
[00:40:00]  That means you've got to be set.  You've got to be ready to go.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to have the...  You've got to figure it out.  The volume's got to be just perfect in your car.  The cell phone's got to be just the right distance away from the speaker.  Yeah.  We understand if they're in commercial, because that's half of it.  A lot of times you'll go, okay, let's listen.  Well, they're in commercial.  Well, that's the bit.  Yeah.  That's the bit, because...  It shows how cool satellite radio is.  Oh, yes, it is.  There's just so many goddamn commercials on regular radio.  Yes, it is.  I've got to ask, Jimmy, is there a crescent little mark on your apple where Ricky's big, 
[00:40:30]  long fingernail stuck into it?  I don't...  Don't let me think of that.  Don't you like that he actually handles an apple?  At least this is kind of wrapped up.  Don't you love that he's handling it with that big, nasty nail?  No, I don't like the fact that Christopher Lee goes and gets my apple in the morning.  It really does bother me.  Nosferatu.  Young Travis.  Nosferatu.  Nosferatu.  What a job this kid did.  Here's your apple.  Yeah, please wash it.  Look at it.  He runs right in.  He hears about the apple.  Look at it.  Hey, Travis.  You apple polisher.  What a good boy Travis is. 
[00:41:00]  Travis is really one of the best.  He's a go-getter.  This guy, Travis, let me tell you something.  Travis, look in that booth right there.  You see Nathaniel?  Nathaniel.  I'm reading his name tags.  They've got name tags on that.  Yeah, Nathaniel, Danny, and Derek.  Yes, I see them.  As soon as one of those guys steps down, you're going to move to the booth, my friend.  I'm hoping one of them leaves.  You're going to move to the booth.  So are we.  One of those guys leave, you're the next one in the booth.  That's what I'm hoping for.  How does that make you feel?  It makes me feel good.  You two can stand in there for free and do nothing. 
[00:41:30]  And I just want to be the first to tell you, we've got a check coming for you, my friend.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Why are the other guys jumping up and down in the booth?  And Travis came in before.  I wanted this ice frappuccino because I was a little bit tired.  And this young go-getter runs right out.  And before the whole segment is finished, he's back with it.  He's back with it already.  You know something, that's something.  I think he's falling into that category of unpaid employee and not just intern.  That's right. 
[00:42:00]  Travis.  He is right now the top of the cream of the intern crop.  Travis, here's the deal.  We want you to be a tattletale.  If you see these guys slacking a little bit, make sure you bring that information to us.  That's right.  Because in the long run, you know who it's going to help.  That's right.  It's going to help me.  You, you, you.  That's right.  If one of those guys falls and decides to leave, you're in.  So it would be in your best interest to start really paying attention to their work ethic.  Leaning against that wall like Nathaniel.  Yeah, look.  See how busy he is right now?  Sitting at that seat like Danny.  That could be you.  Right?  You could be sitting there. 
[00:42:30]  So start tattletaling on them, all right?  That's right.  I'm going to make a list.  Try to get through the bad mouthless and tape it.  Carry a little recorder with you around the office all day.  Norton sucked today, didn't he?  And then lean in.  Very good.  Now he's going to go wash your apple.  Please do, yes.  How cool is that?  I love it.  Especially since he's been holding it in his hand for the last six minutes.  Chatting on air.  Probably all sweating.  Oh, we've got like a pedophile at his sentencing.  Salty apple. 
[00:43:00]  I just love that he looks like De Niro from Taxi Driver.  The first day he was here, I hated him on Scythe.  And now he's one of my favorites.  I don't know why.  First impression was hatred?  I hate all of them when I first meet him.  And now I love him.  I love all of them.  Don't you just hate him?  Because they walk in and you're just like, oh, here's just another useless walking piece of meat.  That's all people.  That's not just interns.  And they walk around and you just go, he's knocking him out to anything.  He's useless.  He's just going to be inconvenient and in the way.  That's right.  And then all of a sudden you're like, wow, this guy knows his stuff. 
[00:43:30]  He's doing stuff.  Right.  Or, you know, you get Ricky.  I think that when I look into a mirror, this worthless piece of shit, you're going to get nothing done.  He's just garbage.  This pile of steak with locomotion.  It's just nothingness with locomotion.  Hey, Sean, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  How are you today?  Good.  Not bad, not bad.  I don't know if you guys heard, but you guys had a little mention on K-Rock yesterday afternoon on the Booker show.  They were actually having a, like, they were setting up some content for people sending pictures of ugly people. 
[00:44:00]  And I guess one of their loser fans sent in a picture of you two guys trying to be funny.  Yeah, exactly.  I was like, oh, that's hysterical, you know?  So, you know, they were having a conversation about it, and I guess the co-host of the show turned to Booker.  He's like, you listen to that show, right?  He's like, yeah, every day.  You know?  I don't know.  I thought it was pretty funny.  What was funny about it, if you don't mind me asking?  No, no, they were mentioning your guy's name, and they were admitting that they listened to your show every day on Howard's network.  No, it's an interesting story, but then you went, it's kind of funny. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I lost a nice thing.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right.  You tried, though.  That was a good try.  I stink.  All right, let's go to Lewis on Long Island.  Lewis?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  I'm nervous.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Lewis.  I've been listening for like two weeks.  Okay.  I wonder about this guy, Norton.  I don't get it. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah?  I thought it was all being Anthony.  This guy's always interrupting yous.  Interrupting?  Interrupting yous?  Yeah.  First you stutter, and then you say yous.  You're horrible.  I don't understand.  You're like a boat anchor.  You mess up the timing.  It's terrible.  You've called before.  Has he?  Mm-hmm.  Is it interrupting when someone's a part of a conversation?  No.  I don't get it, man.  I don't think he's funny at all.  He's just, like, annoying.  Wow, you are definitely in the minority, my friend.  Well, Lewis, let me ask you. 
[00:45:30]  Do you still listen to the show?  I've only been listening for, like, two weeks.  I didn't ask you that.  I said...  I thought you were, like, a guest.  Well, now you know.  Are you going to continue to listen to the show?  Well, I...  Don't stutter.  Just answer.  It's a yes or no question.  I don't know yet.  I don't know.  I'm undecided.  The jury's still out.  I can't take listening to your voice.  Well, I'm here.  I'm not going anywhere.  That's the problem.  I can't take listening to your voice.  You're always saying all this gay stuff, and it's just horrible.  Maybe he's got a problem with gay stuff.  Uh-huh. 
[00:46:00]  Lewis.  So how does it make you feel to know I'm not going anywhere, and you're never going  to be able to enjoy the show without me?  Mm-hmm.  But...  Answer the question.  Are you...  What are you...  The other day you said you were an actor?  Oh, Mike, will you stop stuttering, you nervous asshole?  What's that?  Are you an actor?  I don't understand.  Answer the question.  Are you going to continue to listen to the show?  I told you.  I don't know.  Then why would you call in if you don't even...  If you're...  It's so uncommitted to a radio show that you don't know if you're going to listen.  Why would you pick up the phone and call in?  Because I wanted to figure you out. 
[00:46:30]  I don't understand where you came from.  I heard his opiate before.  I never heard of you.  So what?  You've been listening to the show for two weeks.  Now you're being disingenuous.  You know I'm a part of the show.  You know I'm not going anywhere.  So stop calling up and asking questions.  Stop.  It's annoying.  Because you're lying.  You're asking questions.  What do you know the answer to?  Yeah, you're right.  I love you, Jimmy.  See?  See?  Oh, yeah.  He just wanted to be chastised.  I didn't want to chastise him.  He wanted to be chastised.  I was hoping to get smashed.  Good.  No, I didn't want to chastise you.  I didn't want to chastise him.  I didn't want to chastise him.  I didn't want to chastise him.  I didn't want to chastise him. 
[00:47:00]  I wanted to be yelled at by Jimmy.  Oh, we hate that.  Bye, Louis.  We like the real ones.  I love fake radio.  Bill on Staten Island there.  What's up, Bill?  What's up, fellas?  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  We're trying to take a break here, but what's up, Bill?  Yeah, sorry about that, fellas.  I'm going to take a piss in a minute.  No, yesterday on the Booker Show, he stole one of your bits, and then for about 20, 25 minutes,  he was just ripping on you guys nonstop, nonstop.  You could check on the F.U. line, because I totally went apeshit. 
[00:47:30]  That guy's a complete hack, even though he gave you publicity.  What did he say about the show?  I never actually heard it.  I never heard his show.  It's K-Rock here in New York.  Actually, they did not give us publicity, because I looked at the latest Arbitron ratings,  and that show is dogshit.  Yeah, I called him a hack on the F.U. line, man.  The guy's got no talent.  The show's going...  I like the guy who sits with him, but he sucks, too.  The show is going absolutely nowhere, so don't even worry about it.  Fucking A, man.  So then, good thing he gave you publicity.  And they got Al Dukes, who used to kiss my ass at the old station that I would not even 
[00:48:00]  acknowledge lived.  Al Dukes.  And now he's over there.  The guy that was on the dump button on the St. Pat's...  Yeah, exactly.  ...debacle episode.  Exactly.  All right, we're going to clear the phone lines, guys, in the other room.  Clear the phone lines.  We're going to phone some men.  They're going to do some drinking.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Anthony, we're going to span the country, hopefully, and see what other morning shows  are doing as we speak.  How's that sound?  How's that sound?  Sounds great.  We need our listeners to help us out.  Call the program.  The number's right there on your display, hopefully. 
[00:48:30]  And, you know, tune in to the local morning show, and we'll have some fun today, okay?  Right.  We'll do that next, but first, here he is, talking about XM Satellite Radio, Howard Stern.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along  for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news, 
[00:49:00]  sports, talk, and comedy, all in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit so you can connect XM to any  home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City. 
[00:49:30]  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM is XM Satellite Radio.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Oh, my God.  We have to try this.  God, why didn't we think of this?  I probably did.  John in New York City.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  How cool would it be that after those bells ring, Angus Young would come in with that  riff, Hell's Bell.  Oh, nice.  We got ACDC.  Can you guys play that?  Yeah, ACDC, Hell's Bell.  Can you do two things at one time, Eric? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, look at that.  And someone else saying, Tim from Phoenix saying, it sounds like the audio from a bootleg Metallica  concert, the beginning for Whom the Bell Tolls.  Oh, For Whom the Bell Tolls could work, too.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to try this?  Uh-oh.  All right, we got, uh, which one do we start with first, Anthony?  Do we do Hell's Bells or the Pope Bells ringing?  Whatever they feel comfortable with.  I want to hear both, though.  You want to go with, oh, Nathaniel, confident.  He wants the ACDC to start first. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, ACDC.  Look at him taking charge.  All right, hit the ACDC.  Now you hit the Pope, uh.  Everyone is, as you can hear, cheering.  Hey, guys, from the United States.  You guys, are you convinced that we have a new one?  There it is.  Yeah, we can see the bell now, Chris.  There it goes.  We have a post.  We got us a post.  Rock and roll, baby!  Yeah, rock the post! 
[00:51:00]  What you just saw were the bells of St. Peter's toling what you're looking at on the excited faces of people in St. Peter's Square.  The 115 Cardinals and the women's back.  The church had chosen the 260th post in the history of the church. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah!  Rocking the Vatican.  Hit the post perfectly.  Holy.  Good call by Nathaniel.  Rock.  He won an ACDC first, which made that timeout perfectly.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony, XM202. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, Black City, Blam-A-Lam.  Yeah, Black City, Blam-A-Lam.  Black City, out of town, Blam-A-Lam.  Damn thing going wild, Blam-A-Lam.  She's always ready, Blam-A-Lam.  She's on Rock City, Blam-A-Lam.  Oh, Black City, Blam-A-Lam.  Yeah, Black City, Blam-A-Lam.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  All right.  I'm trying to eat.  Huh?  I'm trying to eat.  Jimmy just fucking set me off in bullshit. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, well, you annoyed me too, so I guess we're human.  No, it's bullshit, bro.  Say what you want to say, but I'm not some idiot.  You're annoyed at me.  I'm annoyed at you.  It's life.  Basically, he thinks we blew off Sean Rouse last week.  No, you.  I didn't blow off Sean Rouse!  What happened?  Huh?  What happened?  Yoshi's here and the dude from Slap Happy, and Jimmy's like a little up to, are we going  to get him on the air?  I'm like, yeah, eventually we'll get him on the air.  I'm not like, whoa, let's stop the show and get these guys in immediately.  And he's like, well, you know, you have a tendency to make people wait outside, and 
[00:53:00]  then they eventually come in, and then, you know, blah, blah, blah.  Tough shit.  Is that the way I did it?  Did I just whine at you like that?  Yeah, you did whine at me.  And then you're like, Sean Rouse came all the way up here to do the show, and you don't  even thank him at the end of the show.  Yeah, you don't.  Like, I had a personal problem with Sean Rouse?  I didn't say I had a personal problem.  I just thought it was something that's good to me.  Sean Rouse opened it up for you in Atlantic City.  You asked, you know, you want Sean on the show Monday?  I'm like, yeah.  I didn't know he was driving too.  You said, hell yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, because I like the guy.  I think the guy's a really funny comic.  I met him when we were on hiatus in Dallas.  He's a really funny guy.  We've never done the show with him.  So I said, yeah, sure.  I didn't, first of all, know that he was driving two and a half hours north just to  do the radio show.  Second of all, we booked him last second.  We had a lot happening that day.  So then you're like, well, you didn't have to go to the Joey Paisano phone call.  Well, first of all, I don't talk like that.  That's a judgment call.  I went to the Joey Paisano call, and it was good radio.  It was about gambling and addiction.  You thought it stunk. 
[00:54:00]  No, no, no.  I didn't say it stunk.  If I thought it stunk, I would tell you I thought it stunk.  You didn't say it stunk.  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  I could have waited until the next day because it wasn't something that, because he was only here for one day.  I didn't say stunk.  If I thought it stunk, I'd tell you that.  Then you sit here and try to make this happen.  See, that's not a valid argument.  If I disagree with some things, then don't ask people to avoid their opinions.  Dude, I have to make judgment calls every fucking day.  These guys, everyone produces stuff for us and throws it in front of Anthony and I.  And then Anthony and I pick away and go, well, we'll try this.  We'll try that.  Right.  Well, this guest is here.  We'll try that.  All right?  And that's how this show works always. 
[00:54:30]  I understand that.  But you think there's some kind of underlying thing that we're purposely making people wait outside the studio.  No, I don't.  Sean Rouse came in.  I never thought.  Don't say you think I think that because I don't think that.  Yeah, you did.  I would say it.  I would say it.  If I thought there was an underlying thing, I would say it.  You don't think guys have come to me after the show and said, you know, Jimmy's all pissed off because Sean Rouse waited outside.  Bill Burr waited outside.  Patrice waited outside.  I wasn't here when Patrice waited outside.  How are you saying that?  I wasn't here.  You're making this up as you go along.  I wasn't here.  All right, it was Bill Burr then. 
[00:55:00]  Bill Burr, you complain.  When did he wait outside?  I don't remember Bill Burr waiting outside.  Then I'm getting wrong information.  They said that you were pissed off that you brought Bill Burr in and he had to wait outside because he's a big, big comic.  When?  What I was pissed off about was Sean.  Had nothing to do with him waiting outside.  Had nothing to do with you going to the Dane Cook, Bob Kelly phone call, which made perfect sense.  Yeah, but we pulled that out of our ass.  We didn't know that was going to be good radio.  It was just the guy.  I never know, dude.  I understand the process.  I understand it.  I'm sitting here with you.  I know it.  And unfortunately, I'm kind of like the point guard. 
[00:55:30]  I have to make judgment calls, okay?  We went to the Dane Cook phone call and it worked out fine.  We went to the Joey Paisano phone call.  It worked out fine.  And I didn't feel like it could wait because it happened while we were in Atlantic City.  We were doing a whole Atlantic City thing.  Sean Rouse came in.  I talked to him.  It was mediocre, average radio at best.  He didn't stink, but he wasn't giving us much of anything.  So I moved on with the program, and then if he could find a spot, he should jump in.  He didn't feel comfortable jumping in.  Well, I can't sit around and wait for someone to be comfortable. 
[00:56:00]  Well, then don't tell somebody two years ago that you're dying to get him on the air.  And don't tell them, yeah, I'd love to have you on the air, and then talk to him for a couple of minutes.  It's not like I just dragged the guy in off the street and go, hey, talk to these guys.  They have a radio show.  You're the one that mentioned him coming on.  You're the one that invited him.  But just because someone is invited on the show doesn't mean it's going to be a guarantee that he's going to get a lot of air time.  But he wasn't doing a bad job.  It was okay, Jim.  There was nothing going on.  I set him up with a couple of things.  And he was like, yeah, he was slow.  As far as the rhythm of a radio show, he was just trying to figure it all out.  So we sat him over there, and we moved on with the show with other things. 
[00:56:30]  And you don't even thank the guy at the end.  That was a total blow-off.  So what does that mean?  I was blowing someone off?  It was rude.  Don't fucking say blow-off.  That's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  Well, you're misquoting me.  That's bullshit.  You're saying I complained about Billy Burr and Patrice.  I wasn't even here when Patrice first came in.  I don't blow off people that I like.  Sean Rouse, I like.  I didn't purposely blow him off.  Okay, so you can call him whatever you want.  That means at the end of the show, I probably ran out of time and forgot to thank him.  There was a lot of shit going on that day.  Okay, so we talked to him for a couple of minutes, didn't talk to him for the rest of  the show, and then didn't thank him at the end.  Nothing.  Just like, you didn't say at one point, hey, we'll hang with Chris Jericho. 
[00:57:00]  Understand he's a big guest.  That's how it works sometimes.  The guy is sitting right here.  That's how it works.  The guy is sitting right here.  That's how it works sometimes.  Okay, that's how it works.  It's not a blow-off.  How many times in the old days did you come in and it was dice and we got to you when  we could?  Understandable.  That's how it happens.  When I was a regular on the show.  So next time, Sean.  But you'd never ignore me.  You would always say Jim Norton's in the studio.  So what do you think the problem was, Jim?  I think you should have at least thanked the guy at the end.  So you think I had some kind of personal problem with you?  No, if I thought that, I would say it.  I don't think that.  So what do you think the problem was?  It was just a bad decision, and I said that to you off-air.  I didn't say, you don't know how to run a radio show. 
[00:57:30]  You don't.  I didn't say that.  You're funny and you're a good part of the show, but where I sit, you don't know what's  going on.  I don't try to know what's going on.  You're the boss.  We all know you're the boss.  I have to make calls all the time.  I don't want to be the boss.  And sometimes, unfortunately, it's going to work out like the Sean Rouse situation.  Oh, well.  Well, then don't ask people to give you input if you don't like the input.  I didn't.  You said it.  Now, many times you say, hey, let me know what you're saying, blah, blah, blah.  Many times you said that.  I didn't.  It came out because you have something in your head.  Like, you have a problem with some of these guys waiting.  And you're like, well, is Yoshi and the guy from Slap Happy coming in? 
[00:58:00]  I'm like, yeah, eventually.  But personally, I'm getting sick of all the porn bullshit.  Right.  And you said that yesterday.  And I thought you were like, come on, man.  Yoshi's a funny comic.  And I'm like, well, get to him eventually.  And the people we had yesterday gave great radio.  So, yeah, but you don't know.  I've had a million porn stars on the show that stunk.  So, Amanda Pete stunk.  You're not sick of celebrities, are you?  You never know.  She was awful.  Yeah, I didn't want Amanda Pete on the show.  I could care less about Amanda Pete.  That was set up by the booker.  That's why we went after her and talked about her stupid, awful tits.  I don't care about Amanda Pete.  The fucking movie came out, the reviews are in, and the movie stinks.  Who cares?  Whatever. 
[00:58:30]  But you don't know.  You don't know what the, you know, you plunk down the phone, you get a guest in here,  and you hope for the best.  I know all that.  But if somebody says something like, hey, man, I would rather do this or I didn't like this,  you can't go, hey, look, you don't sit where I sit.  That's a cop-out.  It's not a cop-out.  It is a cop-out.  Because if you thought Sean Rouse wasn't really fitting in and stuff, you're part of the show.  You could have tried to, you know, get him more involved.  I didn't know.  Why not?  He wasn't fitting in.  Because you run the show.  I know that.  I'm not stupid.  It doesn't mean I can't say something I didn't like.  Dude, but if it's not going in a direction and you think you can help out, then you jump in. 
[00:59:00]  Then that's your job to jump in.  Oh, it's my job to jump in.  But, but, but, but, hold on.  But off air, if I say something, and it wasn't like a nasty fuck you remark, off air, if I say something,  hey, don't do that, you're going to piss me off.  It's like, you can't have it both ways.  Don't tell me you can jump in or you can do this and then not say anything off the air because  I don't, I don't come in as early as you do and I don't know where you sit.  You can't have it both ways.  Jump in.  You can jump in at any time.  The Sean Rouse thing was average radio at best.  I can't, we can't, Anthony and I can't sit here and wait for a radio goal from Sean Rouse. 
[00:59:30]  No, I know, I'm talking about.  You know how many people out there were killed for 10 minutes on this radio show?  He got 10 minutes, it was okay.  Next time he's in New York, we'll throw him on again if he's not too pissed, Jimmy.  And we'll see what happens next.  He didn't say anything.  And then we'll see what happens next.  I just watched you, the guy come in and not get thanked.  10 fucking minutes on this show is a long fucking time.  You're right, you did him a great favor.  So what am I supposed to do?  Thanks for coming in, Sean.  Should we do a Barbara Walters fucking interview with him for a half hour?  No, how about your common courtesy, a guy you've invited on two years ago, to go, hey man,  thanks a lot for coming in.  How about that?  I said thanks off air. 
[01:00:00]  No, you didn't.  Off air, I said goodbye to the guy.  All right.  Okay, off air, you said goodbye to him.  So I have a problem with Sean Rouse.  I never said you had a problem with Sean Rouse.  Stop misquoting me.  Stop misquoting me.  Then what's the big deal that he didn't get a proper goodbye on the air?  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  What's the big deal?  You're the one that was, you were raving about what a great comic you think he is, how you  wanted him to come on.  What is rude about forgetting to say goodbye to a guy?  Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing.  Dude, when there's so much shit going on.  What was going on?  Jericho was here.  Jericho was here.  I think we had something that we had to do at the show, you know, make sure the show 
[01:00:30]  ends on time and in a nice fashion.  That's a lot of shit going on?  I don't know, dickhead, because I don't know what was going on that day, fuckface.  Aw, don't get all angry and yell.  You can't say you want me to voice my opinion and then get so pissed off when I voice my  opinion.  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  You are insane.  No, I'm not.  You're insane at times.  No, I'm not.  So Sean Rouse didn't get the proper goodbye.  Oh, well, it happens.  Okay.  It happens.  Okay.  You know?  Okay.  You can sit here and try to figure it out.  See?  You can. 
[01:01:00]  Because you have all these opinions, how it's supposed to work.  All these opinions?  I fucking never say certain things that I like on the show.  Let's get Yoshi in.  I never have problems with things that are going on the show.  We'll get Yoshi in eventually, no problem.  We'll fit him into the show.  If you would have said that, if you would have said that, I never would have even thought  about it.  You didn't say that, though.  What did I say?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  The porn shit.  It was a big thing.  You didn't go, yeah, man, we'll get to him in a while.  Okay.  It's bullshit.  I said we'll get to him eventually.  It's bullshit?  It's not bullshit.  It's bullshit.  You didn't say it.  You would have said it like that.  I didn't say that we're not getting these guys in.  I'm like, yeah, we'll get to him.  But I'm not obsessed with porn like you and Steve. 
[01:01:30]  Like, oh, God, more porn people.  You know, you guys get all excited.  Can't wait to get to your pictures and stuff.  Who cares?  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  I understand you're trying to do a radio show.  I know that.  Jim, you're fucking pissing me off.  It's bullshit.  You're pissing me off, too.  When you say, you know, that I blew someone off, that is bullshit.  Okay.  That is simple bullshit.  You, you, I didn't purposely, I didn't purposely try to blow someone off that I like.  There are guys I hate, and yeah, I'll go right after them.  But Sean Rouse, I didn't purposely blow them off.  Didn't say your purpose would blow them off. 
[01:02:00]  I didn't blow them off.  Okay, you phrase it any way you want.  And if I forgot to say goodbye on the air, who, who cares?  Okay, no one cares.  In the end, who the fuck cares?  So he traveled two and a half hours north and then took the train.  My point is we shouldn't have had him if that was the way it was going to go.  You shouldn't have had him in.  Dude, it's going to happen again to somebody.  Then you book them.  It's just how the radio show goes.  I don't want your comics.  Then don't get comics, Jimmy.  I don't want to.  You have access to the same people I have access to.  Then don't get comics.  Why?  Because you're personally hurt that someone has to wait out there because we're doing  other radio?  No.  No.  But it would annoy me if I...  I didn't say wait out there. 
[01:02:30]  That's not what I said.  You keep misquoting me.  I did not.  You're like...  Yes, you did.  You said I got pissed off when Patrice had to wait.  And I wasn't even here for that.  All right.  Then I apologize for that.  But you did say something about Bill Burr waiting, too.  But that was another day that was a lot going on.  I do not remember that.  I don't remember that.  That was a lot.  There was a lot going on that day.  When have I been mad about somebody waiting because there was a lot going on?  Huh?  When?  When have I ever said, fucking stop what we're doing and bring so-and-so in?  When?  Dude, you said Bill Burr had to wait.  You said Sean Rouse had to wait.  I didn't...  You said Bill Burr.  I didn't say Bill Burr. 
[01:03:00]  Bring Ben in here.  Get Ben.  I didn't say Bill Burr.  Bring Ben in here.  I don't remember the Bill Burr thing.  What?  I don't remember the Bill Burr thing.  Holy shit.  What?  I'm sure Ben just went, holy shit.  Now Ben's involved.  Yeah, I'm still here, people.  Is he obsessed with people waiting outside a time?  You were upset the first time.  Thank you.  You said this was a long time ago, but...  Thank you.  But I'm not getting them...  Obsessed.  That's obsessed?  When did Bill...  I don't remember Bill Burr.  It was a long time ago.  You said we got to get him in faster.  You said you...  It was a long time ago. 
[01:03:30]  You said we have to get some of these guests in faster.  Well, that's great.  But if we have something going on, we're not going to stop the radio show to get a guy  in who could easily wait a little longer out there because it's very valuable airtime.  That's a fair point.  It's a privilege.  That's a fair point.  But what was going on?  I don't remember the Bill Burr thing.  If I'm some kind of...  Huh?  I don't remember the Bill Burr thing.  I don't remember what was happening that day, but Bill Burr...  So why mention it?  Why not just stick to what we were talking about?  Bill, because it's part of the whole fucking thing.  You get uptight because some of these guys have to wait to get on the show.  Well, I wasn't right about the Bill Burr thing if neither one of us remembers what we were  going on.  If I'm sitting outside the O.P. and Anthony show, I'll wait four hours to fucking get five  minutes of airtime. 
[01:04:00]  Tough shit.  How do you know that I'm wrong about the Bill Burr thing if neither you or I can remember  what was going on that day?  What you are wrong about the Bill Burr thing is because I know he's a funny guy and we  want to work him into the show, but obviously something else was going on.  Okay, so you're saying I'm wrong.  Anthony and I thought was much more important, so we made him sit out there no longer.  So there's no way because neither one of us can remember it, so automatically I have to be wrong  about it because of whatever.  You were obsessed that he was waiting outside.  I'm obsessed.  I didn't even remember it.  Until he's obsessed.  I didn't even remember it.  Ben remembered.  Ben remembers a lot of things. 
[01:04:30]  Ben remembers that we're getting Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark in studio in Boston.  Doesn't matter.  You don't know how a show works and then you have these stupid opinions.  It's simple as that.  I'm sorry.  I had an opinion.  So what?  You're right.  I don't know how a show works.  That's why I roll in when I roll in.  I don't pretend to know how a show works.  Just don't bring any comedians in anymore.  I don't give a fuck.  Believe me, I'll just do my job.  No remarks.  No remarks off the air.  You're right.  You're right.  I don't know.  You're right.  You're sounding insane that I didn't say goodbye to Sean Rouse on the air. 
[01:05:00]  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  It was rude.  I don't even remember my name at the end of the show sometimes.  There's so much going on.  Relax.  You still should have said goodbye to the guy.  Why?  What does that prove to the listener?  That's a listener.  It's the guy that comes in.  He travels two and a half hours north.  I said thank you for the show.  You've been inviting two years.  The show ends and we take our photos with Chris Jericho and we walk around the studio.  We thank some of the guys for bringing whatever they brought to the table.  I said goodbye to Sean Rouse.  Okay, good.  Good.  I said goodbye to Sean.  Okay, good.  So I didn't do it on the air. 
[01:05:30]  That's the big deal?  No, and you know that's not what I'm saying.  You know that's not what I'm saying.  Then what is it?  Because you just blew him off.  You didn't address him at all.  Hey, we're hanging with Chris Jericho.  I blew him off.  Okay, it's the words that bother you.  Stop with the semantics.  Whatever you did, he just sat there.  So?  It happens.  It happens every day on this show.  It's happened a million times on this show over the years.  And have I ever complained about it?  Have I ever said to you, yes or no?  No.  It started because of Yoshi and Brandon outside.  And I'm like, yeah, we'll get to him.  He's like, well, I don't want him waiting out too long. 
[01:06:00]  That's not the way it happened.  Why did you even invite him in?  I'm like, we'll get to him eventually.  You didn't say we'll get to him, and I panicked.  That's not the way it happened.  That's dishonest.  It's not the way it happened, dude.  It's not the way it happened.  Whatever, Jimmy.  Okay.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Not the way it happened.  Whatever.  You got to calm down.  I'm very calm.  You got to calm down.  You really do.  Hey, look, you're the boss, brother.  Everybody knows you're the boss.  I'm not challenging that.  That's not what I'm getting at.  Of course that's what you're getting at.  No, of course it's not what I'm getting at, Jimmy.  Of course it's not. 
[01:06:30]  You know, we all have a say in the show, and if you thought something was going on with  Sean Rouse, you could jump in and try to make it happen.  It wasn't happening.  Do you understand?  It wasn't happening.  So I can jump in and...  The guy's funny.  So I can jump in and try to make it happen, but I can't mention it to you off air because  you're going to freak out and go, you sit here and do what I do.  So, again, you want it both ways.  I can jump in and make it happen because I'm part of the show, but I can't mention it to  you off the air.  And I didn't call you up screaming, but come on, man.  It's been a thing going on.  That's why this happened on the air, that you're obsessed with people waiting outside 
[01:07:00]  the studio.  Why did you say obsessed?  You don't want to say blown off.  Why are you saying obsessed?  You said it about these guys today.  You said it about Bill.  I reacted to what you said.  I don't remember Sean Rouse.  You brought the Sean Rouse.  I thought the Sean Rouse thing was fine, but when I mentioned Brandon and Yoshi coming  in and I'm like, I'm sick of the porn thing, but we'll make it work.  You're like, you know...  Not the way you said it, dude.  Come on, Ope.  It's not the way you said it, brother.  It's not the way you said it.  I'll start recording everything I say so it's perfect for you, you obsessed freak.  No, but I'm going to react when it's appropriate when somebody speaks to me.  That's not the way you said it.  What did I say about Brandon and Yoshi? 
[01:07:30]  I guess we'll get them in.  I don't know.  I'm just sick of porn thing.  Then why do we invite them, man?  Why do we invite them?  Yeah, exactly.  If you don't want people in, why invite them?  It's a very valid question.  Because the show's not all about me.  I understand there's a value to these guys, but it doesn't mean I'm going to bring the  good radio when these guys come in.  I hated those girls coming in yesterday.  But they were great.  It turned out it was great.  You're right.  Because Anthony found an angle.  I was brilliant.  That's the only reason it was great.  Anthony found an angle.  Understandable.  On paper, that looked like that was going to fucking suck. 
[01:08:00]  On paper, Sean Rouse looked like it was going to be really good radio.  Guess what?  It wasn't.  It wasn't bad radio.  It was average radio best.  And when you have a lot of other stuff going on, you have to keep moving on, keep trying  to find the next thing that's going to hit with the listeners.  That's how the show always has worked.  And I know.  I don't understand that.  And these guys will come in and they'll either stink or they'll do good radio.  I don't know.  Which is fine.  I don't know.  But that started the whole thing like, oh, why are you inviting him in if you're going  to make him wait or you're not going to have him on?  If you're not going to have him on.  And then you're like, and the same thing happened with Sean Rouse last week.  And I know for a fact you said something about Bill Burr as well. 
[01:08:30]  I don't remember.  If I did, I would admit it to you, I don't remember it.  But you don't remember it either.  Neither one of us remembers why he had to wait.  I'm being honest.  I don't remember that.  He had a wait because the show always happened.  That's the only reason.  That's what it was.  Maybe you're right.  That's because I know that's how it works.  Okay, so you win that point of the argument because you know.  I'm not going to sit here and go, oh, well, the show really sucks today.  But, you know, I'm on a power trip.  So I'm going to just like Bill.  Never said you were on a power trip.  Shut up.  I'm not going to shut up.  I'm exaggerating.  All right, well, then don't make a little point in me. 
[01:09:00]  And I'm going to like stare out the window and just look at Bill Burr when maybe we could  use him to make better radio.  Obviously, something was happening because I know how I approach the show every day.  Okay, so there are guys out there.  I see them waiting.  I'm like, wow, I would love to get them in.  But I know what we're doing at that given moment is really good.  So instead of stopping the whole fucking thing to get something else going, you got to ride  these things out.  That's how it works.  That's how it always has worked.  So if Bill Burr was sitting out there, that just meant that something else was going on  that was really hitting that day. 
[01:09:30]  But neither one of us remembers it.  It doesn't matter.  So you'll win that part of the argument on point.  And all of a sudden, I'm obsessed because I mentioned Bill Burr had to win.  I don't remember mentioning that.  Yeah, because this is unfortunately the part of the show that I have to worry about every  day.  There was no other reason why he was sitting out there, but that there was probably something  really good happening in the studio.  Simple as that.  That's the only reason.  And I understood when Sean came in.  That's the only reason.  When Sean came in and you went to the Dane Cook Hall, the Bobcat, that made perfect.  I definitely understood that it was what happened once he was in.  But you're still not getting it.  I get it.  No, you're not.  I comprehend it.  I don't agree.  No, you're not. 
[01:10:00]  I get it, dude.  You're still not getting it.  That's arrogant.  I do get it.  I just disagree.  We could have went to the Dane Cook phone call and that could have blown.  You're like, well, I understand why we went there.  Really?  Why?  Because that could have sucked.  No, no.  You want to ask me a question?  Let me answer it.  Bob's a regular on the show.  I understood why you're going to it.  The guy got hurt.  Dane's calling in.  Dane's the guy we wanted to get on the show.  You've been saying you wanted Dane on the show.  Then we got Dane on the show.  I definitely understood why you went to it.  But just because we wanted both those guys on, that could have sucked.  It could have, but I understood why you went with it.  You're making my point.  I understood why you went with that.  Jim Blue, the past, and Dice, you know, there were times they gave us shitty radio. 
[01:10:30]  Just because you know Dice is coming in doesn't mean we're going to have great radio.  Understandable.  No one is saying that.  So for you to say, I understood why you went to the Bob Kelly call, really?  Yeah.  What if we went there and it sucked?  I still would have understood why you went there.  All right.  And you don't understand why you went to the Joey Paisano call.  Not saying I didn't understand, I'm saying once Sean was in, once Sean was in studio  and talking, and you wanted to make that decision, that's your call.  Okay, fine.  But then to not address him at all for the rest of the show.  My God, we should find the Sean Rouse audio.  Through going to break.  We should find the audio. 
[01:11:00]  You're asking me, and I'm explaining my point of view.  From going to break and saying, hey, we're hanging with Chris Jericho, not even mentioning  the guy, and at the end of the show, not even thanking him for coming in.  That's what I was talking about.  Tough shit.  Okay, that's your answer.  Tough shit.  Tough shit.  I say what I say, you say tough shit.  Okay.  Did I thank him after the show yet?  I don't know what you did.  That's all that matters.  You say you did, I'll believe you.  Because we developed these relationships for the radio show.  Okay.  If I forgot to thank the guy at the end of the show, tough shit.  Okay, tough shit.  It happens.  Okay, I say what I say, you say tough shit.  It happens.  Okay.  I know what happens.  I was here when it happened.  I remember what was going on that day. 
[01:11:30]  Chris Jericho, the whole reason, the one thing he asked, he goes, dudes, you know, I love  doing radio with you guys, but if you could, you know, play my song or a part of my song,  that's all I want.  And I knew we were running out of time.  We were supposed to play the whole song.  All of a sudden, there was, I don't know, less than two minutes left, and I'm like, holy  crap, we got to get to the song because we promised.  I know.  Because I tried to, when we promised someone something, I tried to oblige.  So all of a sudden, I'm like, all right, hit the song.  We got to get out of here.  Chris Jericho, thanks for coming by.  Here's Enemy.  It was just a really rushed job end of a radio show. 
[01:12:00]  I remember it.  I understand why you had to play it.  And that's the whole fucking reason why Sean didn't get a thank you.  How come you didn't get like, it's just a thing, dude, I've been in this show long  enough, when you're talking about who's in studio, you're like, all right, man, we're  hanging here with Chris Jericho.  It's just the way you say things.  But when you're saying, yeah, we're hanging here with Chris Jericho, and the guy's just  sitting there, and you don't even acknowledge him.  And I want to talk about it at the end of the show.  And then at the end of the show.  You've got to give some people a little more respect than others, too.  Chris Jericho is known all over the world.  So what?  And he came in.  I know you guys liked Jericho, and he did good guess.  And eventually, maybe we would have got back to Sean or not. 
[01:12:30]  In that case, we didn't get back to Sean or else.  I'm not even talking about getting back to him.  I'm not even talking about getting back to him.  Oh, my God.  But don't say, hey, you can jump in because you're a part of the show.  And then the other thing, get really pissed off if I say something off air.  You can't have it both ways.  No, it's bullshit, Jimmy.  I think it's a cop-out when you're like, you have all these opinions off air.  What?  All these opinions?  What do you mean all these opinions?  I want to know what you mean, all these opinions.  I want to know what you mean.  You got this microphone in front of you.  If you thought you could help the Sean Rouse situation, then start fucking talking. 
[01:13:00]  What do you mean all these opinions?  Then fucking talk.  I want to know what you mean.  No, that's it.  I'd like to know what you mean.  That's a fair question.  All these opinions?  What?  All the opinions?  I love the way the show is going.  What are you talking about?  Dude, I don't feel like getting into all the other bullshit with thinking everyone down  in Washington is trying to sidetrack the show.  The marketing is not there.  Are you telling me that's me?  Oh, my God.  I turned the corner.  Wow.  I turned the corner.  I think they're now doing a really good job in Washington.  You still think Gary Hahn is purposely fucking...  Oh, come on.  Oh, dude. 
[01:13:30]  Dude, did you just say that...  Let's not change subjects.  Stick to the basics.  Wow.  What you guys were discussing.  You're saying that I'm the one who thinks that things aren't getting done?  You're convinced that Hugh Pinero hates the show, right?  I'm not convinced that Hugh hates the show.  I know for a fact that he likes the show, okay?  I know for a fact.  I know for a fact.  Are you really on the air trying to throw me under the bus with Hugh Pinero?  Well, now if you want to fuck around, Jimmy, let's fuck.  I'll fuck around.  Let's fuck around.  Go ahead.  I say what I have to say on the air.  All your opinions, right?  My opinion is this. 
[01:14:00]  That they are worried about the show.  I've been saying this since day one.  It's wrong now.  Let me finish my opinions.  That they're worried about the show.  It's wrong.  And I was right about the advertisers coming off the premium.  I was right about that, wasn't I?  What part?  And one of the reasons that the advertisers would start coming once we came off the premium.  That was the reason they wanted to get us off the premium.  I knew that.  I knew the fact that that was one of the reasons they were going to take us off the premium is  because advertisers were coming saying we will not go while they're on premium,  but we'll go once they're off premium because the show is succeeding.  I was right about that.  That was part of it.  And I was right about the whole marketing thing, which hasn't happened.  I was right about it. 
[01:14:30]  And you thought the same thing.  But now you're acting like, I'm paranoid.  I'm thinking that.  How can you?  That's disingenuous, man.  Nah, forget it.  Come on, dude.  How could you say that?  How could you say that?  I'm paranoid and I have issues.  How could you say that just to win an argument?  Oh, my God.  You want to talk to some of the guys that are paranoid and have issues?  You want to talk to Eric Logan?  You want to talk?  They're like, Jimmy's out of his fucking mind.  Really?  So I was wrong about when that letter went out.  When that letter went out and you guys weren't mentioned in the rate hike, I was wrong to  say that that was hiding the show?  You bought that spin?  Come on, dude.  Wow.  The explanation I got? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, I believed it.  I believed it.  Then you and I are different people.  I definitely believed it.  Okay, then you believed it.  I definitely believed it.  You believed that they just didn't want us associated with the rate hike?  I definitely believed that.  Because when you have a big show on the air, you don't want people to make it look like,  hey, you're getting something good for nothing.  I definitely believe it.  Do I agree with that decision?  No, but I definitely believe it.  I definitely believe that was their logic in that.  Yes, without a doubt.  Okay.  Okay.  I think it was the wrong decision.  I thought we should have been involved with that letter, but I believe their logic. 
[01:15:30]  Right, right.  No, you're right.  I believe.  You turned the corner and I'm paranoid.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I believe.  I'm the one who's thinking that nothing's getting done and you've turned the corner.  Okay.  I think things are getting done.  I agree, actually, in some areas.  I was the number one guy bitching on the show, but now, yeah, I've turned the corner.  So really, why didn't you tell me this?  I think Washington's now doing a good job for the show.  Definitely.  Why didn't you say this when I was complaining about the read that you guys got?  I saw what that was. 
[01:16:00]  You saw the same thing.  You agreed with it.  You didn't tell me you didn't agree with it?  We weren't going to do that.  We were not going to do that, you ass.  No, no, no.  I'm saying you didn't tell me you didn't agree with the channel blocking.  The channel blocking people.  Come on now.  No, no, no, no.  The motives behind the reading, I'm saying.  The motives behind the reading.  When they sent you that, no, no.  When they sent you that paper, when I went crazy.  For the TV spot?  Yeah.  When I went crazy because of the script they gave you because I knew the motives behind  it were to mention channel blocking.  You didn't disagree with me on that.  What are you talking about?  We weren't going to read the thing about channel blocking.  No, no, no. 
[01:16:30]  You're missing.  Oh, you thought that.  I know why that was in there.  No.  See, that's your paranoia again.  I totally disagree.  I said that on the air.  Why didn't you call me out on the air?  I totally didn't.  Because then I said it.  I make some phone calls down to Washington and I see where the head's at.  You left right after the show.  Eric Logan talked to Anthony and I for a while about it.  And I believed their explanation.  I believed it.  They were trying to be funny with it.  And it didn't work.  And that was the email that Gary Hahn sent to me that I sent to you.  Basically saying, look, this was our attempt at humor and it failed miserably. 
[01:17:00]  That was the only reason they did the whole channel blocking thing.  I believe their explanation.  Yes.  Call me crazy.  I totally believe it.  Okay.  Good for you.  I totally believe it.  Absolutely.  Actually, you might be right.  I totally believe it now.  At the point you made a good, the other day you made a good point, but then I'm like,  all right, well, I got to call Washington and see what this is all about.  And the explanation they gave me, I believe it, yes.  The fact that you would make it look paranoid that I've been pissed off at the way certain  things go is mind-boggling to me.  It's mind-boggling to me. 
[01:17:30]  Well, you got to calm down a little bit.  Don't.  There's some paranoia.  You were still bitching about the advertising for the show while we're in the papers that  day.  Yes, I was.  We're on the back page of the New York Post on the sports section, a really nice ad,  and that day you were still bitching about the marketing.  And I acknowledged the fact that that was good.  You said, you don't care about that stuff, and I'm like, yeah, you're right.  That is good.  That was good.  I was talking about the TV commercial and the dialogue in the TV commercial, and you  know that's what I was talking about.  You know that's what I was talking about.  I was talking about the dialogue they gave you, that little thing about, maybe they were 
[01:18:00]  going for a humor thing.  If that had been one or two of the lines, I would have definitely understood that.  But the fact that every single line mentioned channel block.  You're the one that was saying, no one's running this channel.  We didn't get this stuff sent to us.  I totally agree with that, too.  But we're taking care of that situation, too.  But how can you say that I'm the one who's thinking that we're not thinking that we're  not going to be done?  They went with this angle of channel blocking.  So then they had six or seven different versions, because they thought that might make  for a good spot.  That's all that was about.  And had it been other things included?  They had one idea.  They had one idea.  Like, you know what? 
[01:18:30]  You know, these guys talk about channel blocking in a sarcastic, dry way.  This could make a good TV spot.  They were absolutely wrong.  But it wasn't...  I would have agreed with you.  That was the only motive.  That was the only motive they had doing that.  And I truly believe that now.  Well, then you know what?  Because I talk to everybody down there.  Okay, then this is...  Unless they're all just fucking with me, then that's...  This is the case, then, of a guy who's been caught cheating on his wife eight times, and  one time he comes back with glitter on his collar, and it's legitimately there because  he hugged a relative, and she thinks he was cheating again, and he goes, no, I wasn't 
[01:19:00]  cheating.  It's the same type of a vibe.  So you can't call the wife paranoid for thinking the husband cheated.  Jimmy, I'm involved with these guys in Washington a lot.  I encourage you to talk to Eric Logan, because you do have...  I do talk to Logan.  I like him.  You don't talk to him a lot.  I talk to the guy every day.  And I'm just saying, some of the things you have problems with, you should get on the  phone with him, and you'd be more at ease, is what I'm saying.  What are you saying that I have problems with that's so crazy a paranoid?  I don't think the show's been advertised problem.  They were afraid of the show, dude, and I was right about that.  They were taking a slow approach.  I understood that.  Believe it or not, I understood it from the beginning. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  This show in October, I didn't want the whole fucking country to know about.  Anthony and I were getting our chemistry back together.  I was okay with no national spots.  I really were.  Dude, you're making it look like you're comfortable with the way things have gone, and I'm this  crazy person who's screaming for more.  Come on, dude.  We've all screamed and yelled and had our problems here.  You were yelling two days ago.  Huh?  You were yelling two days ago.  Because I didn't know.  You brought up a good point, and then I'm like, wow, you might be right about this.  Okay, sure.  But then after the show, I called and I got an explanation. 
[01:20:00]  I believe what they had to say.  And you also believe the explanation of why Open Ant were not mentioned in the Excel letter.  I completely believe it.  I don't agree with it, but I completely believe their logic in that.  So it wasn't that they were a little afraid of the show, and maybe even justifiably so  considering what's happening.  Dude, if they're still afraid of the show, they would just keep us on premium.  Don't you get it?  No, because of advertising.  No.  Because certain sponsors want to come board the show and just be a part of it and have  us go out and do things.  No.  Wrong.  I think that they realize the show is moving in a different direction.  We don't have a lot of advertisers to begin with. 
[01:20:30]  There's not a lot of guys jumping on board, and the rate for a commercial is so minimal  that they're not going to make any money anytime soon on that.  They're just not.  The advertising guy said that the advertisers want to come aboard.  They want to be a part of the show.  Sure.  That's part of it.  That's part of it.  Well, then how come you think it's not part of it?  That's just one part of it, though.  But if they were really worried about the show, they would just keep it on premium and let  it go that way.  Why do you think that they've been very comfortable with the show and they've been pushing the 
[01:21:00]  show properly?  And I'm this crazy person who doesn't think that.  Honestly, no.  I think things have gotten better, though.  I never said they didn't.  I think they wanted to take a very conservative, slow approach.  Did we agree with that all the way along?  No.  Just the fact that you're making it look like irrational.  In the beginning, I didn't really care because I didn't think we had a product that I personally  was proud to show the whole country in TV's parts.  I'm talking about some January on.  You did care.  And when Howard announced he was going to Sirius, all of us thought, all right, now 
[01:21:30]  you've got to push this show because we've got to be in a position to fight or whatever,  whatever, whatever.  And we wanted them to push.  Starting January.  Starting January would have been nice.  It didn't happen.  But now we're in April and now we've got a big push happening.  So it's a little slower than we wanted.  Yeah, I agree with that.  I agree with that.  But from October to January, this show wasn't ready for a national platform.  It just wasn't.  Anthony and I took two and a half years off.  You're saying you agree with that, but in the beginning of this whole XM tangent, you're  making it look like I have all of a sudden been this problem who's complaining about XM 
[01:22:00]  irrationally and that these guys...  And I love being here and you know that.  Jimmy, yeah, but you don't acknowledge the good things that are happening with Washington.  Of course I do.  Not a lot, bro.  Not a lot.  You're always looking for the other side of something.  Why there was the channel blocking script.  Why we weren't mentioned in the letter.  I was right both times.  Maybe channel blocking way one thing, but I was right about the other one.  No, you're not.  Okay, then you agreed dishonestly.  You agreed with me dishonestly. 
[01:22:30]  No.  No.  I'm not going to explain it again.  When it came up on the show, you brought up a good point.  I'm like, whoa, yeah, we've got to look into this.  You're 100% right about that.  100% right.  But then I wrote some emails.  Anthony and I talked to Eric Logan.  And I'm completely satisfied now that they were just trying to make a joke that was just dumb.  Possible.  Dumb.  Why would there be no other options?  Had there been other options, I would totally believe that.  Because when you're making a TV spot, all of a sudden something hits you.  Like, well, I think this would make a great TV spot.  So let's get six or eight different versions of this and then record it and we'll pick the best one. 
[01:23:00]  But then Ant and I jumped in and said, no, this is just not funny.  It's not working.  I totally believe it.  Completely now.  Completely.  Okay.  Just like you believe.  That one I could swallow more than that's why you weren't mentioned in the rate hike.  I'll let you know.  Well, that's fine.  You can.  I believe that too.  Okay, good for you.  I don't think it's bad business.  I don't agree with their decision, but I believe their intentions definitely. 
[01:23:30]  Okay, good.  Definitely.  Didn't make me happy.  Oh, no, no.  You're right.  Their intentions were good.  Dude, I'm nuts for thinking that.  Dude.  Paranoid.  It was Opie and Anthony coming off the premium.  We're raising your service $3 a month.  No.  How is that good?  Because that's not what it was.  Basically, that's what it was.  No.  That was the two points in that letter.  Baseball?  That's the two points.  Well, I'll tell you.  Baseball.  Free online streaming.  And when you have a show that you're proud of, when you have a good show that you're proud  of, you're saying to people, this justifies the rate hike to a certain degree. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, guys, look what you're getting now.  We're raising the price.  Look what you're getting.  Baseball was already happening.  So they were basically announcing, we're coming off the premium, and oh, by the way,  we're raising everything $3.  But they didn't mention you were coming off the premium in the letter.  That was my problem with the letter.  They just said high voltage.  That's fine.  That's fine.  To me, if you have a show that you're proud of, and you're raising people's rates, and  you're saying, look, but now you're getting this great show for free, that's not a way  of a bad thing for the show.  That's saying, look, people, look what you're getting as a part of this rate hike.  That's being proud of the show. 
[01:24:30]  No, they're proud of the show.  You have no idea.  Okay.  Then I have no idea.  You don't.  You don't.  They're definitely proud of the show.  Okay, good.  You know?  Get on the phone with Eric Logan more, and you'll see for yourself.  I've talked a lot.  The guy's fighting his balls off.  Dude, you don't need to tell me.  Yeah, Logan.  I love Logan.  And he's changed a lot of people's opinions down there.  If they...  Well, it changed their opinions.  You mean their opinions needed to be changed?  I don't know.  It seems like that according to you.  Why would you say that?  You may be like, I'm crazy.  According to you.  And now you're saying...  According to you.  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Ugh.  Ugh.  I feel the same way.  Just the fact that Gears got changed in mid-argument to a whole new argument just is too telling.  I didn't change Gears.  There's...  There's obviously tension between you two.  They've been simmering.  That's all I see.  That's what I see.  And no, I'm not jumping on anyone's side in this argument.  I'm being questioned here.  Where's Anthony jumping? 
[01:25:30]  I'm not jumping.  I'm not getting between this.  But obviously there's tension here.  You know.  I know Jimmy very well.  I know Opie very well.  I see some tension.  I know Jay Moore very well.  Jay, we'll get you in a sec.  I'm sorry.  I don't want Jay Moore waiting.  I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  I'm sorry.  I'm actually sorry, bro.  Now I know what Anthony's talking about. 
[01:26:00]  You don't call people back.  You don't call people back.  Yeah.  So, you know.  You guys obviously have to have a little powwow.  Perhaps off the air.  I hear a little too much personal shit.  My general thing.  To not think there's a little more here than meets the eye.  This is my general thing.  Simple as this, okay?  And call me an asshole.  Call me wrong.  That's fine.  But this is, you know.  Believe it or not, I'm having a really.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Jay.  Jay Moore is completely naked.  Jay Moore just got completely naked. 
[01:26:30]  He's standing in front of the window completely naked.  And I think it's getting hard, too.  Jesus Christ.  Tell him what his pants on.  They're on.  That'll change gears easily right there.  Wow.  Look, this is. 
[01:27:00]  I'll summarize.  And you can call me wrong.  Whatever.  But believe it or not, I'm having a really, really good time with this radio show.  A really good time.  I'm having more fun in radio than I've ever had, okay?  And I just get, from Jimmy at times, a negative vibe.  When, you know, it's always like, point out the negatives, point out the negatives.  I'm just saying, dude.  And if I'm wrong, you can call me out.  And, you know, well, I'm not going to, whatever.  And I get a negative vibe.  I get the calls, you know, and the frustration and stuff. 
[01:27:30]  And sometimes, this is all I'm saying.  And sometimes, I wish you would also just point out a lot of the positive things that are happening.  You do focus on the negative a lot.  That is so sociopathic.  I almost don't know how to respond to it.  Holy crap.  Of course, I'm negative, and I point out the negatives.  But to think, when I've agreed that this is more fun than commercial radio ever was.  And you know I love doing this show.  You know I love being here.  I'm talking behind the scenes, dude.  There's always this negative vibe of what, you know, this, that.  And this is coming from me, who's a complete asshole a lot of times. 
[01:28:00]  And a negative person.  Then you should have told me that instead of saying, hey, man, I really like the way in the conference calls,  you speak your mind, and you try to get shit done about the channel name change and all that stuff.  You're coming from two different points of view.  I'm negative.  We haven't had a conference call in four months, dude.  We haven't had a conference call in four or five months.  How about the Club Soda Kenny situation?  Was I negative about that?  That just got resolved two days ago, bro.  We all agreed on that one.  Ben trying to be the producer holding up a let's move on sign. 
[01:28:30]  Move on.  Ben trying to be the producer.  Move on.  We'll talk about this later.  Cute girl outside.  Cute girl out there.  Jay got naked.  Ah.  You guys obviously need to, you know, sit down and chat.  Off air.  About things.  I just know, I know both of you very well.  I know both of your personalities very, very well. 
[01:29:00]  And I just see a clash going on there.  That's for sure.  I know Jimmy, like Opie says, Jimmy brings up a lot of the negative stuff.  And a lot of, you know, he's always talking to people in D.C. about the problems that we're having.  That is, first of all, that's just inherent in Jimmy's personality.  Is to point that stuff out.  And the way he does it, is it abrasive?  Sure.  Is it in your face?  Yeah.  That's Jimmy.  That's the way he does stuff. 
[01:29:30]  I sit there and I have seen huge improvements over the course of the past couple of months.  You know, things have definitely gotten better.  There's still a huge problem.  I refuse to pay that Club Soda Kenny bill.  I refuse to pay bills that they keep sending me in the email.  I'm not paying those things.  Are they advertising more?  Sure.  See if that lasts.  You know, you, your personality is what your personality is.  You know, I've been with you for ten years doing this show.  I know what it's like. 
[01:30:00]  And you've come leaps and bounds, you know, over the past couple of years.  But to see you and Jimmy in the same room for a set amount of time, which is the past, you know, few months that we've been on the air.  I just see, I see problems.  It's the way both of you are.  You know, blame me if you want, but I'm just trying to get...  You're not blaming anybody.  No, no, no, not you, Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  I'm just saying, I'm just trying to get the negative vibe as much as possible out of my life.  And I still get a negative vibe from Jimmy at times.  And if I sent you down that road, then fine.  You didn't send me down that road.  I'm telling you right now on the air, I don't want to hear as much negative anymore in my life.  Then stop saying as much negative.  I'm saying right now as we move forward, okay?  I said, if I set you down this road, then I'm...  You didn't set me down.  I'm 36, dude.  You didn't set me down any road.  I don't want to hear it as much anymore.  Okay.  I just don't.  I want to enjoy my life. 
[01:31:00]  Dude, I'm not talking just about the radio show.  I'm talking about my whole life.  I'm trying to get a lot of the negative vibe out of me.  I'm trying, okay?  And I just don't want to hear as much anymore like I used to.  I used to really get into it.  I don't want to hear it as much.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  And, you know, you hit a nerve today with the whole people waiting outside the studio. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, get pissed.  What now?  Just, I want the negative vibe out.  When, as negative as you are, which I don't mind that.  I don't mind that.  I'm a negative person, but I'm trying to work on that.  The fact that it's coming in this context, in the middle of an argument, like, Jimmy,  I just, I don't want the negativity.  It's like, what?  What are you talking about?  I love the way things are going here.  Like, what are you fucking nuts?  You hit a nerve with the fucking waiting with the guests.  Simple as that.  It happens.  And it all came out great. 
[01:32:00]  Good.  Let it come out.  It all came out.  And then you switch gears with the XM thing.  Come on.  Stop.  All right.  Whatever, dude.  I'm a dope, and you're brilliant.  And Sam, brilliant, dude.  I bet you switch gears.  No, you're brilliant.  What about that?  You don't think Hugh likes the show?  You're right.  You're right.  I'm a dope.  I'm stupid.  I said dope?  I never said you were dope.  No, you're right, though.  You're right.  Everything you said was right.  I'm wrong.  You're right.  Obviously.  That psychology don't work either, bro.  Come on.  Whatever.  Obviously.  You're right.  You're right.  You don't think Hugh likes the show?  Huh?  You try to throw me under the bus with Hugh Pinero?  Come on, man.  Oh, yeah.  So you're right. 
[01:32:30]  I was wrong to say that, too.  Whatever.  Whatever, dude.  If you want to fight, you know, it gets ugly.  That's how fights always work.  Whatever.  So you can point out that I, quote, try to throw you under the bus with Hugh Pinero.  Hugh Pinero.  I'm never going to win this.  You're a boss, man.  I know that.  Hugh Pinero isn't going to fucking fire you because I said something like that on the air.  I don't think he's going to fire me, dude.  I'm not willing to fire me.  It's not an issue.  Everyone listening to the show knows when, you know, when there's a fight, it gets ugly.  Tough shit.  Uh-huh.  Tough shit.  It doesn't hurt? 
[01:33:00]  So you don't like what I said.  Oh, well.  You said some things I don't like either.  Like what?  Huh?  Like what?  I'm not going to get into it.  What?  I'd like to know what.  I don't know.  No.  Because then it'll be another 20 minutes.  So, you know, you're right.  I'm wrong.  There you go.  Will that make you sleep better tonight?  Dude.  You're putting yourself in this position.  I'm wrong.  Like you're this rational guy and you've just done this job in an argument.  I don't care if you're mad or not.  I'm completely wrong.  You don't care if I'm mad or not.  I'm completely wrong.  And you can try to fix things the way you want to fix them. 
[01:33:30]  Whatever, dude.  I feel the same way.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  That psych shit that works on broads doesn't work on me.  I don't care.  Fine.  Don't care.  I don't care.  Yeah.  When you say you don't care, you care.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben, any suggestions?  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Besides your move on sign.  Can we move on, please?  Jesus Christ.  We haven't done this for a while.  Yeah.  We've been on it for a while.  Jay's here.  Let's go.  Let's take a break and go to Jay. 
[01:34:00]  Jesus.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U.  Life.  This is a big fuck you, the dragon faggot.  Dragon faggot.  You need to shut the fuck up.  Next time I see your ass, I'm gonna put a well sticker over your fucking mouth.  Yeah, this is a big fuck you to that douchebag dragon wagon.  Don't call representing truck drivers, you queers.  Yeah, I want to give a nephew to my wife.  When I married her, she was beautiful, skinny, nicest person in the world. 
[01:34:30]  Now, she turned into a complete, I didn't want to even mention it, just call her huge, obnoxious, no humor at all, beast.  What really pissed me off is that she ripped up my Jim Norton ticket for the burrata.  I was all psyched to go.  She ripped it up.  Oh, thank you very much. 
[01:35:00]  F.U.  And I am going to listen to the show.  I am gonna call into the show.  I'm sick and tired of you telling me no more Opie and Anthony.  And thank you for ripping up my signed Opie and Anthony pictures.  I was so proud of them.  Thank you.  You wait.  I'm going to be a pest, too.  I'm gonna go to Opie and Anthony, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to get even.  F.U. 
[01:35:30]  Fuck you, little doggy company.  Go ahead.  You pay $100 million a Howard, $10 million a Martha.  You know, at $12 a month, 12 months a fucking year, you're only making $120 million with each one of your 1 million listeners.  Douchebags.  You take $110 million and pay for them, you have $10 million for the whole rest of your company.  Opie, asshole, fuck you.  This big F.U.  goes out to that pizza dog shit out in Chicago known as Man Cow.  All right, Man Cow.  I'm the champion of free speech.

[01:37:00]  We're back with Norton and Friends.  Is that funny, at least?  We're done.  All right, thanks.  We're done.  And that's real great, guys.  It's Friday.  Make me wait 40 minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Jay Moore.  A bunch of beautiful girls.  Make a guy wait around outside for 40 minutes.  What's up, Jay Moore?  Who is it?  Roush?  Who?  Roush?  Roush?  Sean Roush. 
[01:37:30]  That guy's never had more press in his life.  I never heard of him and I'm a f***ing comic.  This guy's been talked about for two hours.  This guy should come in here and tongue your bag.  Wow.  Hillary, how you doing out there?  Who's Hillary?  Oh, you got to know everyone out there, huh?  Yeah, I never sat on a couch like a common Joe.  Wow, who's that chick?  She's in Facial Extravaganza 1 through 30.  Stop.  Is that part of the Slap Happy series?  Yeah.  She actually is in one of the Slap Happy movies? 
[01:38:00]  Let me grab a box cover.  Got it right here.  Oh.  That's her right there?  That's her.  Yeah, you might want to be nice to that girl.  How you doing, dollies?  And she's lovely.  She's from Chicago.  She weighs 98 pounds.  You got all the stats.  And I talked to Brandon Irons, who I've always been a fan of,  and he said she has a true passion for her work.  Brandon's sick.  He's an animal.  He said, I really started to love her when she let me drink her pee.  Really? 
[01:38:30]  I always wanted to try it, he said.  I said, really?  Jimmy's going to love you.  Her face looks like strudel in the middle photo on this one.  It does look like something they whip up.  Well, that is about eight cocks worth of jizz on her face.  I said it.  That's not one load, is it?  And she said, oh, no.  Well.  Who's Eric Rouse?  Sean Rouse.  Eric Logan, Sean Rouse.  Two different people.  Sean's a comedian.  Eric.  I heard Eric Logan less than I've heard of Sean Rouse.  Rouse.  He's the programming president. 
[01:39:00]  I'm not taking sides.  You guys know that.  Eric's one of the bigwigs.  Jimmy did get a little out of line, yeah.  What?  Stop.  You got a little out of line on yourself.  Jimmy.  Billy.  Ah.  We both out of.  Fuck that guy.  It's my fucking potty.  I pay for the drinks.  It's my potty.  What if you read it, old Billy boy?  I'll admit I was out of line.  No problem.  Ah, see, we're making headway.  I don't know that much.  Jesus.  When my naked body pressed against a glass.  Enough.  Enough. 
[01:39:30]  I felt bad.  It's a tempt.  Let's attempt.  We're going to move on.  To move forward.  Dude, I tell you, I'm not happy with what happened, but I'm not even annoyed anymore.  Did you see the squished black guy?  What?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  On the truck in the post?  Yeah, it's the cover of the New York Post.  The guy lived.  Why can't they just turn the wheels in other directions and kind of go scoot?  Pull him out or just back up?  They tried that.  He screamed.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  One guy go left, one guy go right.  Go.  And there's a picture of a ruler inside in the story, like, this is what eight inches 
[01:40:00]  looks like.  And I'm like, well, I know that.  Bus on one side, truck on the other, and a jig in the middle going, hey, what do you  want from me?  No, Bell?  Well, I say monkey dunk tank, I get it.  And they put crush hour.  What the fuck is Christina Applegate doing, dancing?  She's on Broadway.  Oh.  Yeah.  Welcome to ADD theater again today.  No, I'm going to get better.  That's okay.  I had a little too much attention in the past hour, I think it was.  Is that an hour? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  It seemed like it.  That was not an hour.  Dude, it seemed like it should be 11 o'clock.  I've been here 45 minutes.  It was about an hour.  Oh, my God.  It was about an hour, yeah.  Yeah.  What are you eating?  Pop tart.  You like...  Pop tart diva.  No, Eric brought him in and goes, calm down, eat some pop tarts.  Eat a pop tart.  Did you guys get instant messages about the poker chips that drove people crazy when you'd  click them?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I almost called. 
[01:41:00]  I was driving in LA, and I just...  Wow.  You don't like the sound of poker chips, though?  Not for three hours.  It was me.  Eric, there's a thing that these guys do behind the scenes.  They take everything away from me, because I'll just tap stuff all day.  Look, there's not a pen near me anymore.  Pop tarts don't make much noise.  I used to do this all...  ...during the show.  Tap.  Very annoying.  Ed Burns, a huge Opie and Anthony fan.  I worked yesterday up in the Bronx.  Really?  Oh, nice. 
[01:41:30]  You couldn't bring him in?  He's kind of busy.  I know, I know.  Look at me thinking there's a chance.  Having a baby with Christy Turlington.  Nice work, Ed.  I'd love to have him come in and sit out of the studio for...  I go, Ed.  Can I...  You married...  No, no, it never happened.  You married Christy Turlington.  He goes, yeah, sometimes you got to walk away.  Sometimes you got to walk away.  I'm like, Heather Graham and all this.  And he goes, sometimes you got to walk away.  Jay, sometimes you got to walk away.  I'm like, yeah, well, that's easy.  You know, Christy Turlington, pregnant. 
[01:42:00]  Sure, I'd walk away too.  Heather Graham, huh?  Oh, Ed Burns.  Legendary.  Jesus.  He had them all.  She's a good one.  She's the best piece of ass I've ever had.  I had them all over the world.  You don't come to Vegas and talk to a man like Mo Green like that.  Like that.  Like that.  Mikey.  Ant, you're the concierge.  And his cousin, Sko.  I'm supposed to give a big shout out to Sko.  What is it, Valley Stream? 
[01:42:30]  I think this one phone call could bring everyone back onto the same page.  I hope it's Frenchy.  I really believe this guy could bring it all back on the same page.  Everyone on the same page.  Bill.  Yep.  What's up, buddy?  Am I on the air or no?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm just going to say, I was watching Channel 7 News,  and they were, the anchors were making fun of two radio guys  that were arguing with each other on the air.  They played a clip of us arguing.  You played it, Billy Boy. 
[01:43:00]  Makes their little argument seem like dumb stuff now.  You got the L.A. clip, though.  The clip of the L.A., the woman and the guy.  What happened?  In the newsroom.  Oh, it was great.  That's good.  What happened?  Come on.  Oh, these anchors at a news desk right before the news went on the air.  And we should play the ABC clip, too, just because there's a lot of new listeners.  Where's Eric?  Eric will find it.  They got into a little tiff before going on air,  and the guy starts accusing the woman of drinking, and it's really brutal.  What channel?  Oh, you got it?  It was something, some channel out in L.A. 
[01:43:30]  You might recognize the names.  I got to tell you guys, whackbag.com, I went on later in the afternoon.  The Photoshop stuff they do, it's hilarious.  They do it.  Hilarious.  The midget pictures of Voss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're brutal.  Shooting baskets.  And then there was like a baby's hands mixed in with midget hands.  Like, you don't even know it, but I was just that stoned.  It's really funny.  Those are baby hands.  Those aren't midget hands.  Did you see the one of Ozzy biting my head off?  No.  We got a picture.  That's an animation.  Oh, it's fucking great, and they loop it where he leans over and fucking bites my head off  and stands back up and smiles. 
[01:44:00]  They're geniuses.  The new pope is a nerd.  Oh, yeah.  They cleave on Little as the pope, because I said I wanted a black pope.  I said the new pope is a nerd.  If you watch Blazing Saddles on TBS or TNT, they edit out the farts in the campfire.  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  And they keep the word nigger.  Really?  I was so appalled.  You were appalled.  I was appalled.  I don't know.  A fart is more important than that.  That movie, without the word nigger, really isn't very funny. 
[01:44:30]  And you've got to understand where it was coming from.  But to edit out farts, like a guy said, we can't air it with guys farting because they're  eating beans, but then everyone's dropping n-bombs.  It's like, come on, dude.  Well, to understand where it was coming from, you know, who wrote the movie.  And why can't white guys say it on Comedy Central, but all the black comics just say  it like it's nothing?  Dude, that's every argument I ever had a tough crowd.  That's every standards and practices discussion we ever had, is why can they do it on this  show and that show?  Because, you know, it all depends on what point of view you're coming from. 
[01:45:00]  If you're coming from a fucking testosterone point of view or whatever, conservative point  of view.  Well, black guy, you just sit on a panel and go, well, you know, I got cousins that act  like niggers.  And it's like, it's fine.  Yeah.  And then I, and look, we're all pausing to see if he's not going to say it, is he?  Well, dude, they would let, I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town.  They would let Chappelle's show say it.  Chappelle's show would say it, but then Keith or Patrice would try to, Keith Robinson wanted  to say it in a sketch.  And it was just the whole vibe of Tough Crowd. 
[01:45:30]  They wouldn't let Keith say it on Tough Crowd, but they would.  Same channel.  Absolutely.  And the same color.  It wasn't like it was some white guy.  And Colin tried to say it in a sketch where it actually made sense.  They would not allow it.  He was like, you know, parodying Leonardo DiCaprio and all those fucking wannabe white  guys.  But yet they let that one guy say it.  Remember the first Chappelle's sketch that was huge?  Because she married a nigger lover.  Right.  That guy, they allowed him to say it.  So it was all the context, man.  They were very, very selective in the way they let you say it.  It was annoying.  I want to try to bring us back to the news thing.  Keith was great on the show when he kept talking about cops.  With Jay in the studio.  It was very difficult. 
[01:46:00]  I know, Anthony.  Very difficult.  We actually wanted to play the news thing, the argument on the news.  Is there photos of these people?  Well, you know.  Well, you've got to explain.  We watch this one news channel every morning.  Oh, we're doing the ABC one first?  Yeah.  You've got to set that up.  What town?  Right here, New York.  This is New York.  Roz Abrams?  No.  She's old school.  I forget his name.  She was on last night.  Was she?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's still doing it.  She's still working?  Yeah, Sue Simmons, the Power Dyke.  Well, it's the Steve and Bill show, basically. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, it's Steve and Bill and the chick, whoever it is in the middle that tries to mediate the  two.  They can't stand each other.  And you can tell every morning there's something going on.  There's some underlying thing.  Well, the newscaster, Steve Bartlestein, yeah.  Yeah.  He's a gay fellow, which is whatever.  There have been all kinds of accusations with him doing crank and kidnapping people, stalking.  Stalking and bothering people with, like, laser pointers and stuff.  Yeah.  He's a real kook.  The Post had a lot of fun with him. 
[01:47:00]  I think it was last year.  So, he's on, and then there's this weather guy, Bill.  Bill.  And you can tell they just don't like each other.  Yeah.  And the tension bubbles up pretty much every morning.  And every once in a while, they kind of go at it.  This guy's not gay.  Yeah, he is.  No, he is.  You don't think so?  He really is.  Really?  Yeah.  He's harassing guys.  He's a fruit.  Larry Bird and Jerry Buzz are at my hotel.  Really?  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:30]  That's very interesting.  This goes off.  I love it.  Oh, my God.  So, Steve and Bill, one morning, I guess Steve was doing a report on Donald Trump's wedding  and the wedding dress, and he mentioned Donald Trump's fianc√©'s name, and he got it all wrong.  And instead of just letting it slide, Bill, the weather guy, just jumps on Steve about it.  And Steve gets really pissed off, and they go at it.  And I think later on in the argument, Steve accuses Bill of letting a guest wait outside.  And then it gets really uncomfortable for the poor chick that's sitting in the middle. 
[01:48:00]  She just sits there silently, reading instant feedback, all uncomfortable.  So, let's go to the clip.  All right, here's the clip.  Have you seen this?  This is a big dress.  It's something old, something new, and something that costs about 100 grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress made for a supermodel.  Melania Nels, the former or the future, Mr. President.  Why would I go over that name again, Steve?  What was that? 
[01:48:30]  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it?  What'd you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  Put that on over there during the video.  What then, Steve?  Go ahead, do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me.  I just, I wanted to know what you said.  No, if you're not the anchor, then don't.  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano from Cripton, New York.  And the bride plans another dress of hero wing design after the couple's first dance.  Wedding is set for Saturday. 
[01:49:00]  Why don't you give a shot, then, Bill?  Hey.  I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing the audience.  And I'm just saying, my bad, my bad.  What a dick.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking for it.  I'm just saying, would you like to take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold outside.  It's cold in here, too.  Take a shot at the weather if you want.  I don't know.  I'm talking about it.  I'm good with that. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, dude.  I get paid either way.  I know you, I know you, I know you, I know you.  It's so cold for the weather to start today.  And it will be a day where it will be a cold day.  You know what?  Wow.  The anchor was cool.  Yeah.  The weather guy was a dick right there.  He's just laughing at him.  Take a shot at it.  Yeah.  Take a shot at it.  Come on, Billy boy.  If I'm the anchor and the weather guy is giving me shit, say, look, guy that says,  for those of you that don't have windows in your home, this is what it's like outside.  That's a weird gig, weather man. 
[01:50:00]  And the anchor was right, by the way.  It is Melania now.  She said it right.  How about that?  He goes, all I heard was Melania now.  And then he's goofing on him and laughing at him.  And that's live.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Every morning they got something, a little tension.  Every morning there's something simmering.  Not like that where we can play it every day.  We tape it.  We tape it every morning.  We're just waiting for the next time.  We know there's going to be something going on.  Yeah.  I like when the weather guy goes, and this is what it looks like outside right now.  Yeah.  Right now.  Here's a camera.  In case you're at a fucking bunker or a Skinner box being raised by hippies. 
[01:50:30]  Skinner box.  Oh.  And then we have the L.A. clip.  $20 shoes.  Yeah, let's do the L.A. clip.  The L.A. clip.  A little more brutal.  This is from KABC out there.  I think this is like 10 years old.  Uh-oh.  You might not be able to go to the clip.  What'd you do, Eric?  Fuck.  Oh, here we go.  There it is.  This is great.  This fight.  Real fast, Hope.  Oh, boy.  Brandon Irons.  Yeah, we'll get him in.  No, no, no.  I don't care if he comes in at all.  But I just want to say he's a great director.  And Baker's Dozen. 
[01:51:00]  Starring Hillary Scott.  Yeah.  Who takes more loads on her face than a chink in a Bukkake movie.  Will she take a load today, you think?  An expressionless wall-biter.  Bukkake, sir.  You think she'll take a load today?  Hillary?  Hey, Brandon?  Thanks, sweetie.  The guys want to know if Hillary's taking loads today.  Let me handle this assholes.  Let me handle this assholes.  Brandon.  Brandon.  More loads for Hillary?  We're done with that movie, man. 
[01:51:30]  Well, what's next?  Are you going to take loads right now?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well done.  What's her fee?  Because I have per diem.  I think it's on the house today.  Wow.  Whoa.  On the house and on the bridge of the nose.  Hey, you know what?  I've never done DP before, and it's like a fantasy of mine.  And I don't mind.  Who's going to be the D?  Ask her right now.  Maybe she'll do it just for you.  This will bring everyone back together.  Who's going to be the D?  Come on, guys.  Who's going to be the D for double?  Jay, work this for us, please.  We need something now.  Hillary, come on.  Forgive your beating. 
[01:52:00]  Get her in here.  Hillary, come in.  Have her step in.  Let's share a mic.  Wow.  Come here, girl.  Nice.  You want to sit down?  I'll get up.  Sit here.  Okay.  Well, that's how her face looks.  It's like your girl.  Yeah, you can't tell when it's glazed over.  You got some crusty stuff.  Do you guys swing?  Wow.  Do you guys swing?  How old a gal are you?  I'm 22 years old.  22?  How long have you been making movies?  Six months.  Six months? 
[01:52:30]  That's it?  Yeah.  What were you doing before?  I sold mortgages for two and a half years.  And what?  That wasn't panning out, really?  No.  Not paying the bills?  I was like entry level.  Yeah?  Were you like a little...  Get it?  All right.  Entry level.  Entry level.  You still are.  Were you slutty and stuff?  Like banging a lot of guys anyway, so you figured you'd make some cash making movies?  Um, no, but I know I knew that I had slut potential.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And instead of going, like, with movies where you're just kind of, you know, getting banged 
[01:53:00]  or something...  Well, that shit's getting banged right there, Ant.  Oh!  Holy moly.  There I am.  Right up the pooper.  That guy...  That's right.  That guy that's...  Wow!  That guy that's stabbing you in your fart box in that movie?  Oh.  He doesn't respect you.  Oh, but it felt so good.  Did it?  Oh.  That face looks like it feels good.  Oof.  It looks like you're...  You're taking a math test and you don't know one answer.  Runny eye makeup.  That is really hot, the runny eye makeup.  Oh, it's the hot...  Why is that guy's bag brown? 
[01:53:30]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  His fucking balls are brown.  There's something...  Is that guy Russian or something?  Yes, he is, actually.  And that's why his balls look like dirty potatoes?  Would he buy those on the street from some slope?  Oh, my God.  You want potato?  Wow.  And then she pulls it out of her keister and goes right down on.  Aren't you afraid of hepatitis?  Oh, what a gal.  Aren't you afraid of hepatitis?  I'm afraid of less things.  Oh, you are a good egg. 
[01:54:00]  Look at you.  Choke that thing down.  Jesus.  Do you like watching yourself?  Sure.  Oh, you're gagging a little bit.  My dick's actually bigger than his.  I'm flabbering all of it.  It's fantastic.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Look at him.  Please come to me.  Let me make the fuck on you.  I will now make the good fuck on you.  Please say the first line again.  Please.  He said, please, come to me.  Please, you come to me.  Come.  Come over to me and I will make the fuck in your ass. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, that's funny.  Yes, the Russian man fucks so much better than stupid American.  What are you saying right there?  Wow, you are really.  Yeah, what are you saying?  I'm getting a flow.  Do a little lip syncing.  I have no idea.  It's probably, ow, my ass.  Oh, no.  It's saying, please, I need more.  Please, more.  Wow, you know something?  Some girls need it slow when they're taking it in that one.  This guy is pounding like he's.  How do you do it? 
[01:55:00]  He's got a five-inch dick.  What does he care?  Come to make the fuck.  You will make the fuck on American.  God, look at me.  Oh, you came out.  Way to go, stupid.  Hold out.  The piston slipped out of the cylinder.  Wow.  Do you see any problems going to the bathroom after that or anything?  Um, no. 
[01:55:30]  No?  No.  God bless you.  I'll pull my hair back.  I'll pull my hair back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Think I'm in love.  And I can't go, no.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  All I can look at is that punched ball bag.  It was really annoying.  It's uncomfortable.  Look at.  It looks like it's prepped up into his lower abdomen.  I'm looking at him.  Push him down.  Ow.  Oh, Rocky's eyeball. 
[01:56:00]  Brandon, you need some stunt dick.  It's all dark and ridged.  It looks like a Klingon head.  Oh, my God.  I'm fine.  Wow.  How long until the money shot?  Do you remember doing this one?  Oh, yes, of course.  Yeah?  It's a while.  The best is yet to come.  Really?  Where do you take it?  In the face?  Oh, yeah.  And then I have a little clean-up girl that eats it all.  A clean-up girl?  Yes, indeed.  That's what you need. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God.  That bag is so distracting.  It's very distracting.  You can light a match.  Wow.  Not for nothing, Charlot, but we had his ball bag the other day.  It was like shoe leather.  The fifth of the order has never had a bad ball bag in their life.  Let's stick to what we know here.  We know making horses.  Wow.  So you've been doing it only how long?  Six months. 
[01:57:00]  Six months?  I just want to know how she went from, what were you doing, mortgages?  Yeah.  From mortgages to that.  Entry level.  To meet somebody and talk into it?  Yeah, I'm from Chicago, and there's some guy I met.  He's somehow connected in the industry, and he talked me into it.  How did you meet him?  Through a friend.  I don't even remember how.  Just through a friend.  I didn't meet him as a porno guy.  I just met him as a regular guy.  And did he finally say to you, hey, you want to make movies? 
[01:57:30]  Well, he talked to me about it, like how much money the girls can make,  and how much it could be.  And then he sent my pictures to an agent in L.A.,  and I started talking to the agent.  Did you do anal sex before?  Yes, I did.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Did you ever make any movies at home, maybe with the camcorder?  Uh-huh.  Something like that?  There's Hillary Scott with a whole lot of dicks in that one shot.  Jesus.  It was gracious.  Oh, boy, here's a money shot.  Oh, the eye makeup is running, dude.  Oh, but that's the first one.  See, I actually eat that on my face. 
[01:58:00]  You swallow?  Oh, my pretty knee.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's my leg.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it tastes good.  Oh, it tastes good.  I come on fucking face.  Look at you.  Eat my cum.  Eat it.  That's good Russian cum.  Tastes like vodka.  Oh, you're such a good girl.  Yeah, look at you.  You're a good, big girl.  You're a big girl. 
[01:58:30]  She loves to taste the communion wafers, Father.  This isn't enough.  It really is.  This isn't enough cum for a hungry girl like me.  Well, then step aside, Norman.  That's why she needs the hungry man cum.  I'm ready for a dozen cocks.  A dozen?  I think you're going to need some help, though, a little girl like you.  Maybe.  Beautiful girls.  Setting up a good scene there.  Couple dozen cocks. 
[01:59:00]  Kick that club sucking cocks.  We need a couple dozen cocks.  Oh, who's this coming in the scene?  Some hoes.  Hi.  It's Lexi Rippa.  Lexi?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  It's Kelly Rippa.  Clean up the cum off the face.  You're the clean up girl?  You're going to clean up the cum off the face.  Yes, she is.  Are you up for that?  How do you apply for that job?  20.  She came crawling in like a cum Roomba.  Just waiting to suck the cum off.  I met her.  She was licking the floor at Show World. 
[01:59:30]  Twist that tummy first, sir.  Yeah.  Good things I want.  What a great movie.  All right.  Now, that's a lot of dicks.  Wow.  This is my kind of party.  Oh, you're insatiable.  A black one, a white one.  You know what the worst part about watching this is?  I'm hoping I just don't blurt out lucky girl.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Brandon, are you in this one?  No.  He's the camera guy.  Look at the black guy behind Lexi, trying to creep in the back door. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  But she won't notice.  Like we did in prison, yo.  Yeah.  He doesn't even want to fuck her.  He's trying to steal her ankle bracelet.  Wow.  You don't want to be the short stick in the gangbang.  Brandon, how do you pre-screen these guys?  Whoa.  No, it's just any and all comers.  Roaming war helmet.  Take the room full.  Roaming war helmet.  Rock.  I saw one in action like that. 
[02:00:30]  A little teabag, a little teabagging.  Now, Hillary, are you like just at this point in the movie, are you just insatiable for  cock?  Oh, yes, of course.  For real?  Yes, for real.  I completely enjoyed making that movie.  So at this point, with like eight dicks and what is it, a dozen?  Brandon?  Yeah, there's 12 guys.  There's 12 guys.  You're just in another dimension of just cum and cock.  Yes, that is correct.  Oh, wow.  You enjoy choking on it?  Oh, yes.  I mean, no, mine specifically. 
[02:01:00]  Jesus.  I don't know.  I haven't had the opportunity.  All right.  Let's go.  Why go to the low?  She makes that pat from the donkey.  I just had my last eggnog face.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  She's sitting on my lap, and I'm watching.  It's like a new girl's cheek to cheek.  Oh, all over the face.  How can two guys wax their bags helmet to helmet?  Whoa, and then they're...  Oh, we just shot on the guy's hair.  That's hot. 
[02:01:30]  He's just eye makeup again.  Is it stinging your eyes?  Yeah, well, he told me he wanted my eyes open as long as possible, so I'm wiping off, and  then he's yelling at me, no, don't wipe it off.  I'm like, do you want my eyes open or not?  Do you realize what a star you are?  You completely eclipse that other girl.  That other girl is a non-factor.  No, the other girl, her role is the clean-up girl.  She's got to eat the loads off of Hillary's face.  I know, but the guy was jerking off on both their faces, and Hillary just completely dominated.  Anthony, would that bother you if someone shot on your helmet like that? 
[02:02:00]  Of course.  Isn't it weird that black guys come as white?  Wouldn't it be so much fun if it's like chocolate milk just shot out like a nice Nestle quick snack?  Oh, my God.  I like that kid-eating lima beans face.  Nice.  This girl was injured at the explosion at the Elmer's School Factory today.  I want to be drenched in it. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Do you mean that when you say it?  You mean what?  You said, I want to be drenched in it.  Of course.  At this point, you're just in another dimension of fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that guy had nothing.  No.  That guy had nothing.  Yeah, a curd and a whey.  Don't rehire that guy.  You think I could be anonymous, just come in with a mask and cover my tattoos and drop a map of Hawaii on him?  Yeah.  I mean, we don't have to shoot above the waist. 
[02:03:00]  There you go.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Big Jim Slade.  No, Dribbler.  Dribbler.  What are you, Randy West?  That guy went at it.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  I would want to come on all the black guys' hands and make them feel faggy.  Oh, look.  So the dirty little whar.  Oh.  No, you're getting me where it hurts.  Don't say that.  Good girl.  What a good girl.  A couple of beautiful girls.  Oh, boy.  We got more.  Where are you guys going tonight, Kit Kat Club? 
[02:03:30]  Oh.  Oh, look at that guy.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  DNA farm.  Are you actually counting down in your head as this happens?  Like, all right, that's eight.  Uh, no.  You just want more?  I didn't count.  Sounded like Jim's act.  Look at all that on her face.  My God.  You need a shower.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That guy really had us in quantity.  That guy had glow worms crawl out of his dick. 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  When's it going to heal?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That was a paper mache.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  You're going to look every drop off my face.  Me?  No.  Oh, she's not talking to you.  You're confused.  She's sitting on your lap.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Oh, there it goes.  Like a retard drooling. 
[02:04:30]  That was a Rikers Island.  I can't believe I'm doing this load.  Oh, that's a waste.  That could have been the new Martin Luther King that just threw a ball off her face.  Just nothing.  Ended up a batch in a movie.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm a dirty little whore.  I'm a dirty little whore.  You're not.  Yes, you are.  Good person.  Yes, you are.  I need more.  You need more, girl.  Oh, my sweet little girl.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  What? 
[02:05:00]  Whoa.  I like this guy aiming for the forehead and hair.  That's passive-aggressive.  Oh, yeah.  He's a light one.  Stay there.  Don't you fucking move.  Oh, yeah.  Don't you fucking move.  Brandon, you sound like a friend of ours.  Yeah.  Suck that cock.  Don't you move.  There you go.  Suck it, you fuck.  Another one.  How about...  Because it's Baker's dozen, Anthony.  How do these guys time it out within two minutes of each other?  No, there's a technique, you know.  You just got to get them all ready.  In the DVD extras, you see the girls let the guys finger their asses, and they spread and 
[02:05:30]  all that.  Is that it?  I want every draft.  There she looks like.  Remember that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, right before the Nazi guy's face melted  when the Ark of the Covenant opened up?  Oh, she looks just like that.  Thank you very much.  And another?  Do you have a website?  I'm working on it.  Oh, wow.  Is Brad that a website?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was a nice one.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a super soaker.  Is that me? 
[02:06:00]  I almost missed it when you went behind the Stebbins Freeway sign.  Wow.  And another one right to the front of her head, in her hair.  Wow.  See, the problem is it starts to go watery, and the more guys, they don't add to it, they  actually take away.  It's more like you're pissing on a girl's face.  Jesus.  It's like it.  It's not that they're doing it.  It's kind of washing it away a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, you little sight.  Look at all of you.  Come on.  All right.  Look at her go.  Look at this.  It's like a pool skimmer. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Oh, get in the eye socket.  There's a lot collecting in there.  It's like cum liposuction.  Yeah.  Oh, how's that taste?  Salty.  Like cum, you idiot.  Like buttermilk and Clorox.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That was not a random example.  Fuck.  What do you mean?  I just thought of it.  I know what cum tastes like. 
[02:07:00]  I'm a man.  Wow.  I've been to camp.  I fell asleep first at the HUD house.  Oh, look.  She's sucking her nose.  Got to clear those nostrils out.  Oh.  You wouldn't believe the number of times we've had the girl freeze at the moment.  The clean-up girl just looks in total disgust at all those loads.  And says, I can't do this.  And just, ah.  And then you take her to the weeds in C-Caucas and go, now you're resting.  Yeah, you're resting. 
[02:07:30]  I know what I'm doing.  I'm resting.  Beans, I thought I told you to go fuck your mother.  I thought I told you to go bukkake your mother.  What are you doing?  You saw the papers.  My head was like this.  I wish I was big just once.  First of all, she was a hooah.  Yeah.  But no, we bring her back later on.  And there you go.  Very nice.  Wow.  Is that yours?  Wow.  Not mine.  You are.  Next time, bring that butt.  Oh, she got zits all over her bottom.  Who is that girl?  Oh, me. 
[02:08:00]  She's an accutane suppository.  You're a big, bright, shining star.  These girls don't hold a candle to you.  Oh, thank you.  That is amazing.  You're a big shot.  There you are.  Look at you.  I'm back again.  Brandon, I'm kind of like hugging your girlfriend.  Yeah.  Now, what's going on over there?  I see Jay.  She's sitting on my lap because there was no place to sit.  And then when she said she was a filthy, dirty whore, I had to hug her.  Yeah.  Are you feeling anything underneath you?  No, I'm a gentleman.  No, I've been feeling, but nothing yet.  No?  Really?  No.  There's your leg muscles. 
[02:08:30]  Nothing yet?  Do you want to feel it?  No.  How do you not get a rod, though, with her on your lap?  Because I'm a fucking man and I can control myself.  Would you get completely naked and sit on Jay's lap?  What good's that, though?  She's going to sit in my dirty subway jeans.  All right.  I'd love to sit on your lap right now.  Get out there, Jay.  Don't go fuck yourself.  Hey, Salve.  Salve.  So what do we do?  Do you have a website?  No, just for the company. 
[02:09:00]  The movie's put out through Platinum X Pictures.  That's like the man.  We want to promote you.  We're working for the man.  Fuck the man.  We want to promote Brandon Irons.  No, the greatest thing about a company like Platinum X Pictures, they give hard-working  perverts like me the chance to own their own product.  So I'm the owner of this movie, and you kick back a percentage to run the company, but  it's the best way.  Like the passion of the Christ.  Yeah, you know.  Kind of.  She looks the same as he did at the end of that. 
[02:09:30]  Fantastic.  Look at all those loads on your face.  I eat these ones.  Really?  There you go.  What, do you just squeegee them off into your...  Wow.  Is this pretty much, I guess, would be your specialty, huh?  This is like...  One of them.  Why don't you do double penetration?  Because I haven't done my first one yet, and it's like a whole big marketing strategy in  porn, like your first thing, you get paid like X amount of money for your first one.  Have you ever done it in real life?  Um, yes, well, it was actually, it was on a porn set. 
[02:10:00]  I was doing just a regular anal scene with like a bunch of guys, and it was like off  camera.  Mm-hmm.  So I was glad the camera was turned off.  Off camera.  Why?  Just banging off camera, just for the hell of it?  Well, yeah.  Wow.  That one day.  Jeez.  Do you think you might have hepatitis?  What's going on on these porn sets?  That's outrageous.  No, I don't.  You don't have hepatitis?  No.  No, you're all tested.  I saw you do.  I'm all tested.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Do you have sex for like, I don't know, romance or boyfriend or anything like that, 
[02:10:30]  or is it just strictly business?  Or is it just strictly to get back at your parents?  No, I do it for pleasure.  You do?  Yes, I do.  Even the movies are just for pleasure, and it happens to pay the bills and stuff like  that?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  That's not like just the company line or anything, really?  You're like an info then?  Kind of.  Yeah.  I'm all nervous about where my hands are, Landon.  I should go to the lake to get one more chapter.  It'd be very pretty.  Wow.  Thank you.  Smooth of me. 
[02:11:00]  One more.  Jimmy.  Jesus.  It was good, right?  Jimmy knows how to do it.  The movies are playing here in the studio, so I guess we fast-forwarded to another money  shot.  I have another scene.  Wow.  Look at her face right there.  You are up.  Here you go.  Brandon, your mule's not in this at all?  Well, no.  Somebody's got your camera, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, why do you want to see his mule so bad?  It's not out of queer.  I know.  Because it's like watching Tyson fight.  This fucking mule is ferocious.  He's all concerned about the ball sack.  It's ferocious.  It's a weapon.  Brandon is a big dick. 
[02:11:30]  Brandon strikes a blow for every man every time he takes it out.  All right.  Let's see it.  Wow.  Brandon, let's see it.  There's not much going on.  Come on.  In the films, it's just the grand.  Let's see it.  Who's bigger, me or Brandon?  Brandon's cock is bigger than you.  How big is your cock?  Have her fluff you, Brandon.  Yeah, let's get fluffed.  And we'll see who's is bigger.  Here.  Jay got naked earlier.  Here.  I defer to the greatness of him.  There's no way.  In fact, I'm going to sign him up to an exclusive contract. 
[02:12:00]  Fuck Hollywood.  Right.  Fuck all those big stuff.  Yeah, let's do it in the valley, man.  Me and you.  Just fucking blowing loads on chicks' faces for a couple grand a week.  Fuck.  I don't have to quit my day job at waitering at Coco's on Lankersham.  I'll create a photo off that one.  I have my camera.  I don't even take a picture.  You're a movie star and your fucking cock is pressed up against the glass.  I can't photograph that and it's all at the star.  But she didn't see it.  No?  I didn't.  How about me and Brandon?  You fluff us and we see, let's see who responds better. 
[02:12:30]  Because I think he's jaded in the industry.  Oh, I'm way jaded.  So how great would it be to be able to square like me and all of a sudden just, like, you  know.  Game on.  Let's go.  Scissoline.  Yeah.  That is disgusting.  That guy was a New England clam chowder dispenser.  You know, like, Hillary's obviously a star.  How'd you like to be the who in the background just, like, sucking cock for no reason?  Can you rewind that?  Yeah, for the listeners.  It was just on the, the guy shot over her head and hit that wood cabinet four feet behind 
[02:13:00]  her.  I swear to you.  I see.  It hit the wood cabinet.  Are you completely ashamed?  Yes.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Pretty girl.  You want to get naked for the guys here in the studio?  Okay.  Yeah?  Me?  Me?  That'd be great.  For everybody.  No, you want me to hug her?  No, not you.  I'm not going to hug her.  She's Brandon's girl.  Not you.  Yeah, if you would, sure.  That's too far back.  Look at this.  She looks Puerto Rican, kind of. 
[02:13:30]  Brown toe.  No, no, it's Lucy Thai.  I know, but she's got brown lips.  She looks like Yoshi.  Oh, my God.  Because of her racial background, they call that cum tsunami.  It's great.  She gets washed away, pulled back.  Right.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Nice nose ring.  Harry Farrell.  Yeah, kind of made a nice little.  Oh.  This girl's like, my turn yet?  No, that was her first day in the business. 
[02:14:00]  Her name's Monique LaRue.  Came to just watch the scene, and she got hoodwinked into being in it.  Did you have to pay her?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Because that's the way it goes.  You want to get your feet wet, honey?  You just start sucking cock, you know?  I think it's the next guy.  Pay attention and watch it go over her head and hits the cabinet.  I'm not a big fan of the guys cumming on your forehead.  No, it's awful.  It's good.  It's like a kind of ritual.  No.  You've got to make the icicle effect, though, so you start high and it goes low. 
[02:14:30]  Ah, there you go.  So there's a method to the madness.  Yeah.  Look at that.  That's a nice one.  Wow.  I think it's the guy coming up.  Yeah, this guy.  Maybe not.  No, it's not him yet.  Not him.  No.  Jesus.  Next guy.  Wow.  You need protective glasses.  Oh.  Those egg whites need another minute or two.  You need the...  I'll see you, Golds.  You need the Brandon Donnelly glasses. 
[02:15:00]  Next guy's got to win for Ultimate Range.  Now, that doesn't train you on just having them dump on your face, does it?  I prefer to swallow.  Oh, wow.  What a good girl.  Am I out of line here?  Where's this one?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Look at this.  It feels so good.  Jesus Christ.  What a rickety.  It's a fucking daisy air rifle.  Put an eye out.  Bounced off.  The black guy's like, let me get in here. 
[02:15:30]  We hit her forehead and bounced off onto the rug.  It was very pleasing.  It was a fire load.  I would be the worst at this because I would only want to shoot it on other guys to be  funny.  It's you know one guy just leave in disgust.  That guy just walked out.  This is in Brandon's office.  Yeah.  This is in your office?  Yeah.  I got to smell it after.  Yeah.  I got to sit there.  It must be great for the cleaning lady.  He's like, I know.  Come back tomorrow, Mr. Brandon. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  That guy came on Brandon's death.  Where is this in Shatsworth?  Canoga Park.  All over the keyboard.  Who's the custodian of records for this film?  That would be me.  Wow.  Oh, that's a fucking load.  Why do they keep doing it in your eye?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what the director told him to do.  Well, the director's wrong, Brandon.  Yeah.  We like it in the mouth.  You got to shoot it in her dirty little mouth.  That's another movie.  Yeah, it's a different series.  She's actually in that series. 
[02:16:30]  She's got a filthy little mouth and it needs to be filled with hot loads of cum.  She just said she likes to swallow.  What's his eye business?  This is a whole facial series?  She looks like she's in an accident.  There's a different swallowing line.  See, you got to do the cross marketing.  Well, I think guys, they get off on this, have issues.  Okay.  Do you have a big load for me?  Oh, look.  Oh, he's missing.  I love you.  Jesus.  Stop.  You're spilling it.  You're spilling it.  You're spilling it.  I love when you come in my eye from your grandson, Frank. 
[02:17:00]  Okay, here's when she balks.  The cleanup girl actually does a refusal.  There'll be a cut.  Wow.  And she had to be straightened out.  Really?  No, not right now.  You yell at her off camera.  You say, hey, there's a lot of things buried out here.  You threaten to, like, kill her?  Wow, that guy had nothing left.  Yeah, some of these guys are dropping loads for a living day after day after day. 
[02:17:30]  So?  Oh, you see her feet over there?  Her feet just walked into the scene.  You can see her kind of stop.  Just those two.  Oh, boy.  Here it comes, right?  Like, at the end of Dress to Kill, just those two nurse shoes.  Brandon, I think you should be the cleanup person.  There's not enough money in the business for that.  You created it.  Uncircumcised.  It's going all over your carpet.  Jesus, Brandon, what the hell?  It's slipper than banana peels, really.  You fall every day. 
[02:18:00]  Walks around, sounds like he's walking on Captain Crunch.  Swatches of rug coming up on the shoes.  CSI Canoga.  Get the black light in here.  Someone stabbed a pituitary gland.  Pituitary gland.  Here she comes.  Okay, here.  Now there's going to be an incident that happens.  There she is.  Whoa, she got freaked out.  No, no, she spits it off camera right there.  There's a yell.  And now she's coming up to do her job. 
[02:18:30]  What is it doing?  And what exactly did you yell to her?  Get the fuck on that face!  Don't waste it.  Oh, so it's a nice atmosphere now.  They released it, you lick it!  You earned it!  I think she almost peeked it up, too.  Yeah, just to punish her, we made her lick it off the carpet,  which I found out later gets you banned from certain internet distributors.  It's considered degrading to make a woman clean it off the floor.  Yeah, that is.  Well, it limits your...  Who comes up with those guidelines? 
[02:19:00]  There are actually psychologists who screen for moral content  and what's going over the line.  And, yeah, this failed on certain websites.  Wow.  Well, I don't see any difference between what she's doing now and what...  Oh, she looks like she's running a Ralph.  She is not a happy person.  Yeah.  Not enjoying it.  This is her first scene ever.  Really?  How much did she get for this?  Pennies on the dollar.  It was a Big Mac and large fries.  Really?  A Subway token and a bucket of chicken. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  This is what happened.  She just came in to visit, huh?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That looked like a cream puff.  Now, shove her face in it.  Oh, God.  She's licking it off the rug.  She should.  She's a little hoover.  And look at her cross.  Her cross is dangling in the coma.  Oh, she's gagging.  Oh, this is just...  Wow.  You know what?  Fuck her.  She's a dumb cunt.  Jesus.  Jesus.  She is.  She's a nice girl.  Yeah, that's why she tried... 
[02:20:00]  I'm trying to help you out.  She tried to get out of your scene.  You had to take her outside  and have, like, a Teamster meeting with her?  She looks all frightened.  Sad.  I love the cross dangling in loads.  She's got a cross dangling in loads.  That's amazing.  Always give a preview of the next volume  because if they like that one,  they're sure to buy the next one.  Oh, is that with the...  Oh, this is kind of like...  This is a preview.  Coming Attractions.  The rule of Dick.  You know what I don't like about this one?  Oh, right.  That's not Hillary.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:30]  I see a...  Holy moly!  Up her nose.  Is she in Kiss?  See you on the message boards.  It is up her nose.  Jesus.  Wow.  That is a salt.  Yeah.  Amazing.  It's a salty assault.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you.  Look at her eyes.  It looks like a sonogram.  Wow, look at that.  Very good.  So if you guys here at the show could help us recruit a few, you know, good guys that 
[02:21:00]  can drop loads.  Oh, you need the guys, not the girls.  What are you doing this afternoon?  Don't give a...  I don't...  I don't give a fuck.  Don't look at Yoshi.  What's he got?  Iron Man prostate competition.  We got a guy with a really big hog around here.  If you can, like, fucking have the camera work where he herks and jerks and moves around,  we got a guy who would love to...  Yeah, you might not get a good focus on him.  Dude, I can get all kinds of people and no one shows up.  I got ten big cocks coming.  Tom Brady's going to be a celebrity. 
[02:21:30]  Star-stop it.  Wow.  This is, like, almost...  This is, like, disturbing.  Yeah, she's really into it.  What's that?  We're going to take a break.  I've got to go to the bathroom.  Oh.  Hillary, what's your last name?  Rose?  Hillary Scott.  Sorry.  Hillary Scott.  Who the fuck is Hillary Rose?  Some Hillary.  Yeah, Jay.  Yeah, I like the other broads I bang.  Look, there you are.  There's my girl.  I'm so happy for you.  I'm proud of you.  I thought she was taking a close.  What happened? 
[02:22:00]  We got to pee, and then we're going to come back.  And then we're going to see who's got a bigger cock, me or Brandon.  Oh, God.  You don't really want to get involved with that, Billy.  I love you, Jay.  You don't want to get involved with that.  You know my shit's correct.  Then we're going to have another contest.  Who's got more money, me or Anthony?  No.  I don't get it.  Probably you, Stu.  Throw some money down.  Let's have a bet.  I'd like to, I'd take whatever, Brandon.  I'll bet Brandon's soft against you hard.  I bet you have more money because he's divorced.  Brandon, are you circumcised?  Yes.  You got big balls? 
[02:22:30]  Nice?  No, they're kind of, you know, evenly placed.  Oh, all performers tested for HIV and STDs.  Good.  Play safe.  This is where I'm going with this.  Where you guys, you can tell me where you're staying off the air.  I've always had a fantasy to do DP with a girl.  All right.  Really?  With a girl?  And, you know, you haven't done it on film yet, so maybe we can practice.  Practice makes perfect.  All right.  And bring 12 other guys because a baker's dozen isn't complete unless it's 13. 
[02:23:00]  No, no, no.  Two guys is not enough for Hillary.  No, no, just us partying, you smoke a little grass, and then we do our balls rub together.  It's nice.  And I don't mind our nuts.  It's the most subtle attempt at getting laid after the show I've ever heard.  I guess you could fluff us both and just get things started.  No, no, no.  Let's just go.  We got the chick here.  Two cocks.  Two, you know, and I'm, you know, because we were talking, I don't mind balls rubbing  together.  I don't feel faggy about it at all with, you know, Hillary in the middle.  It's like, all right, that's good.  Our balls are rubbing together.  Okay.  I wouldn't care for that at all.  I can't have my bag touch another man's bag ever.  With her telling me I'm a dirty little whore and I need you to come in my face because 
[02:23:30]  I need my medicine.  I don't care who's in the middle.  I'd hold his balls in my hand.  I don't give a shit.  I couldn't do that.  Personally, I think you've got to look at her ass just to see, do like an engineering  survey of her ass.  Could you stand up, please, just take down the pants?  You're mashing my cigarettes.  I don't know.  She's kind of tiny there.  You know, it's like tiny little pinprick of an asshole.  Nice sermon, father.  Let me see.  Jay's taking a really in-depth, close look. 
[02:24:00]  Aging Dr. Moore.  Oh, God.  I'm like an aging guy at the strip club.  You're getting all up close.  Oh, God bless you.  All right.  We have to take a break because we hope to take leaks and jack off.  All right.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No.  Oh, God.  He spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, God.  Opie.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:24:30]  I'm freaking out.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  Opie.  Anthony.  Dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness. 
[02:25:00]  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  Go check it out, the O.P. and Anthony program.  Notice who's not in the studio anymore.  Jay is outside the studio, I think, wheeling and dealing.  Kind of working it a little bit with Hillary. 
[02:25:30]  Trying to close the deal on a DP, I guess.  Good luck.  Good luck to him.  Wow, she is really a dirty porn star.  Thank you.  Some of the porn stars come in here and do the basic banging and BJ thing.  They're usually pretty uptight about even talking about it.  Never mind taking their clothes off or anything like that.  That kind of porno is just that down and dirty, disgusting, whore porno. 
[02:26:00]  You've got to love it.  And what else could they do with it?  Exactly.  What else could you possibly do with that?  Unless they change the rules.  Yeah, it's amazing.  All right.  I got one for home.  It's called A Good Source of Iron.  And he told me it's all swallowing money shots.  So I'll be screening this later. 
[02:26:30]  I really like the one girl's swallow on camera.  I've never liked the spit it out routine.  Ever since I was a little kid.  Yeah.  Ever since I was a kid.  I don't like the stuff like that.  I mean, it's entertaining and stuff.  But as far as being hot or something, I'm not really into that.  I like...  What, a load on the forehead?  Yeah, with the hair pulling and, you know...  Oh, I like it.  I'm more...  You know, I like the basic...  I like it if she likes it.  Around the pool, you know, kind of... 
[02:27:00]  You know, in the game room kind of thing.  The guy comes over...  Playing EverQuest.  You know.  She's playing EverQuest and...  Yeah.  She just got home from junior high.  You want some kind of story.  Not even the story.  Just a slight setup.  A slight setup is nice.  But it's more just not the hair pulling and having her lick it up off the carpet kind of thing.  You know, call me a hopeless romantic.  What can I say?  Isn't ass to mouth like just hepatitis... 
[02:27:30]  Waiting to happen?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think hepatitis can't just jump out of an unhepped ass, can it?  I heard you can get it from ass-eating.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Heard from who your doctor is saying you have?  No.  Like, that guy was all the way inside her ass.  Yeah.  And then she takes it out and...  Right.  And sucks it.  You think maybe that could...  You're eating shit.  Yeah.  Bro.  Oh, then it's all right, then.  Let's go to Joe.  It's okay.  Shit dick.  Joe, what's up, buddy? 
[02:28:00]  What's up, man?  Listen, I got to quote Jay out on this one.  You know, I'm a big Jay fan, but I got to be honest.  Jay, you ain't going to do shit.  You got Nicky Cox at home.  Come on.  Let's keep it real.  You're right.  I'm right.  Wow.  Come on, I'm right.  What an argument you're getting.  Why are you shouting?  I disagree with you.  What's the matter with you?  Come on, Jay.  What kind of deal are you trying to close?  I'm a big fan, but I got to call you out.  Yeah, then I said you're right.  You're still shouting.  You have been diffused, sir.  I'm going to go home and have sex with my girlfriend. 
[02:28:30]  Punch it out.  All right, there goes Joe.  Is she with you in New York?  She's at the hotel right now.  Yeah?  No XM radio there, right?  No, she don't care.  No.  Really?  She's the best.  Make propositions like that?  Double penetration?  What am I going to do?  No problem?  What am I going to do with that?  What are you going to do with that?  Double penetration.  For what?  For the AZT cocktail?  For the story.  Look at her meat flaps.  I didn't even notice there's still porno on in the back. 
[02:29:00]  In the back of me over here.  Yeah, what am I going to do?  She's a cute girl.  I mean, you know.  You know what?  If the guy needed a favor, maybe I'd do her help.  Yeah.  Help her.  No, I...  Yeah.  But, you know, now I'm looking up and she's doing the I love it, I'm a dirty horse thing  again.  That gets me.  Never turns you on, Jack.  You know what turns me on?  What?  You.  Thank you, Jack.  You got Nicky Cox.  You got Nicky Cox.  Come on.  You know, on the message board, everybody said all I talk about is having Nicky Cox as a 
[02:29:30]  girlfriend, and I listened to the show, and I didn't mention it once.  You didn't talk about it.  You guys mentioned it.  We're obsessed with it.  Of course.  You didn't talk about it.  Yeah, I read that message board.  I love it.  Ricky, you want one of these?  Jay Moore stinks.  You want these porno movies?  Oh, there's our agent.  Give one to Ricky.  He could look.  Ricky.  There you go.  Got him.  Who's the guy, who's the extra from, uh...  You could say it.  We say it all the time to him.  That's our agent.  You know, your agent. 
[02:30:00]  I swear to God.  Which one do you mean, the little kid?  That is.  Or the guy.  The one that's kind of running at Indy his whip.  Oh, that guy.  That's Ricky.  Throw me the idol.  Ricky!  We still have the KABC fight, Anthony.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I kind of forgot where we were going before.  Go, Valley Stream.  I've got to say it, Ed Byrne's cousin.  And then we've got the Paul Abdul audio.  She is...  She's on drugs.  I'm saying it.  I'm not even saying it. 
[02:30:30]  And someone I know used to dance with her when they were a little girl and said she was a mess.  Really?  She must have been cleaned up for some point, or else you wouldn't notice how much of a mess she is now.  But when she's doing American Idol, she cannot string together a coherent sentence.  She slurs.  Her eyes are at half-mask all the time.  And she just babbles.  Here's Randy Jackson, no matter who, just saying.  Yo, yo, dog. 
[02:31:00]  Yo, dog.  You just called the girl a dog.  It's good.  Yo, dog.  That was hype, dog.  But I just wasn't feeling it, girl.  It was aight.  It was aight.  We've got to back up again.  Oh, well, she just went away.  What happened?  Fran thinks you're definitely going after the porno chick.  Who?  She hung up, so it's too late.  Sorry.  Way to go, Fran.  She just hung up.  I'll be on hold.  Oh, God, my boss is coming.  Click.  What did she think?  She really thinks you're going after the porno chick. 
[02:31:30]  And you're just playing on the air.  Might.  It would have been fun to go to, but she hung up.  All right.  Well, we got the audio of Paul Abdul basically saying she's not.  What do you think she's on?  And she sounds loaded when she's saying it.  Yeah.  She's on the pills, I think.  Yeah.  I think she's on the pills.  I was taking that Vicodin for my toothache for a while.  Me too.  And I've got to be honest with you.  My tooth wasn't hurting anymore.  I was still taking the Vicodin.  It was at night, and I'm like, I don't feel any pain, but I don't want to feel any either.  You've got to finish the prescription, though. 
[02:32:00]  Not the Vicodin.  It says it right on the bottle.  No, penicillin says finish, you know, make sure you finish this.  The Vicodin is take when needed.  Dude, when I got my eyes done, they gave me a thing of Valium that, I don't know, I had  for like three months.  I figured you had to finish the prescription.  Yeah, you just keep taking it.  I'm going to go in for a refill, to tell you the truth.  I'm going to try to squeeze the refill out.  Actually, I have another prescription for the Percodan.  Yeah.  Or Percocet.  Which one is it they give out these days?  Percodan, Percocet.  One of those Percocets.  One of those Percocets ones.  And I got another prescription because I went to the dentist upstairs, remember that? 
[02:32:30]  And he gave me a painkiller.  Then I went to the root canal guy, and he gave me a prescription for painkiller.  So I go down to the pharmacist, and he goes, why do you have two prescriptions for painkillers?  It's like, oh, it's because the one dentist and the other one, and I'm supposed to.  I told him I had a problem with the one, but it was a while ago, so he gave me two.  And if I have a problem with the one, then I could take the other one.  I'm there at the pharmacy making excuses to get these drugs.  You're already a junkie. 
[02:33:00]  I'm a junkie.  And you haven't even had your first pill.  You have to be a junkie.  I'm lying to the pharmacist to get my drugs.  It's great stuff, the Vicodin.  Yeah.  Relaxes you.  I took one last night.  But I think she had something like that.  Did you?  A little reefer, a little Vicodin.  Aren't they great?  It's just like...  Quick load.  It makes you all...  You turn your head and everything just whoosh, whooshes by a little bit.  You get up to take a leak.  You're kind of walking around a cloud a little bit.  Sometimes when I take too much Vicodin, I kind of forget how to pee.  Do you?  Yeah.  What does it do? 
[02:33:30]  I just...  You go in your pants?  No, I just stand there at the toilet going, I haven't peed in a while.  I probably have to pee, but I'm not sure what muscle to use.  You usually wait for the feeling and then step up and it's automatic.  And then I stand there and I'm...  I have a narrow urethra anyway.  Bobby?  I have to touch my nipples sometimes to pee.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm dead serious.  Please tell me you're kidding.  I'm dead serious.  You know what I do?  It relaxes me.  It does something where it's just like a relaxing thing when I have to go.  It's because you're a bald fag. 
[02:34:00]  No, no, no.  I get the touch and it kind of like releases.  Are you...  I've heard of, you know, having to do things when you're taking a crap.  You know, reading.  Let me take a picture with this girl.  Things like that.  But I want to hear this ABC.  All right, here it is.  Paul Abdul.  I want Americans to know that I've never, ever been addicted to anything.  No chemical dependency.  Nothing.  Nothing for recreational purposes.  And nothing even for drug purposes for my injuries.  First two sentences are completely slurry from pills. 
[02:34:30]  I want Americans to know.  Can you do it again?  Booze?  It doesn't seem like a booze high, though.  Pills?  Yeah, it seems like a Vicodin.  I want Americans to know that I've never, ever been addicted to anything.  No chemical dependency.  Nothing.  Nothing for recreational purposes.  And nothing even for drug purposes for my injuries.  Nothing for drug purposes.  For drug purposes.  I never take drugs for drug purposes. 
[02:35:00]  What a midget hoover.  Not even my injuries.  She's...  Take a picture of...  She...  She...  When...  When American...  On American Idol, when people perform and...  Oh, this is...  Comes her time to...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What do we got on there?  This guy's a councilman in Texas, and he's got a twin.  Oh, there's a big story there.  He goes to one event, and he sends the twin up to shake hands at another place, and they're  all over town.  Wow.  Two, like, Chinamen running all over the place.  That is brilliant.  And in Texas, like, they're not going to split atoms over, like, what a Chinaman looks like. 
[02:35:30]  God damn.  Welcome.  Well, you look just like I don't know about it in here, with a flat-faced, wall-biting  personality.  Oh, God damn.  And they got caught, and now there's a whole thing going on.  That's great.  Great to meet you, Jackie Chan.  Hey, get to send him around, do public appearances for any Asian guy.  You should get Yoshi in here, too.  Oh, he just nailed you.  Yoshi.  Oh, no, look out.  Ah!  I got you.  Ah.  He loves being naked.  This guy checking me out.  Ew. 
[02:36:00]  Who is that guy?  Which guy?  That guy right there.  He's a real good guy.  Bruce wasn't checking you out.  He's waving.  He's shocked.  He waves a little weird, but he's a good guy, man.  He's...  What's he doing?  Jesus.  Yeah, Paul Abdul can't...  She cannot tell the people that are performing on American Idol how she feels.  Right.  It's impossible.  You know, you get Randy does the dog, dog, you know, oh, your performance last week was  a little better than this one.  And then they go to Paul, and she's like, you're just a shining star in a world that 
[02:36:30]  needs the love and...  She sounds like that dude every time.  And I'm watching going, why hasn't anyone brought up the fact that this chick is stoned  out of her gourd on something?  She's up there.  She's just gone.  No one seems to have brought it up.  But I guess since she's addressing it, someone's bringing it up.  And she did such a good job addressing it.  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  She wants to set the record straight.  Yoshi, grab a mic. 
[02:37:00]  We didn't say come in so you could sit on the couch over there.  Yoshi.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing, man?  Good.  Good.  I'm reading articles and tabloid junk and message board junk.  Saying that I'm a drug addict.  Damn that one.  And I must be because my wild behavior on American Idol that I don't make sense when I give  my constructive criticism was continuously getting ugly with the lies that people were 
[02:37:30]  saying.  It was time to set the record straight because I've been through too much.  Oh, my gosh.  Because you sound like you're on drugs.  Dude, I swear I didn't hear that clip before.  I just said what I said.  Yeah.  If the case was that this wasn't happening, it wouldn't be people like myself just bringing  it up out of the blue and it being true to the point where she has to address it.  Dude, I never watched the show and I noticed that she sounded fucked up when she was talking  to us.  She sounded high when she was talking to us. 
[02:38:00]  I thought she was actually drunk.  And it's not something like last year.  She wasn't like this last year or any of the previous seasons.  If she isn't on drugs, I suggest she go see a doctor because she's had a stroke or something  because she is completely effed up.  Right on.  Another clip?  It was a series of multiple car accidents where I was hit and an unfortunate plane crash.  I ruptured so many discs. 
[02:38:30]  I knew something was going on in my neck.  I was getting numbness and tingling and my hand would walk and such excruciating pain.  What?  So what does that have to do with anything?  Who is she, Evil Knievel?  Multiple car wrecks and a plane crash?  When was Paula Abdul in a plane crash?  Did I miss something?  No.  Did she really say plane crash?  She said a plane crash.  We got to listen to that again. 
[02:39:00]  It was a series of multiple car accidents where I was hit and an unfortunate plane crash.  I ruptured so many discs.  I knew something was going on in my neck.  I was getting numbness and tingling and my hand would walk.  You're plummeting off a cliff.  Such excruciating pain.  I blew myself up with dynamite.  That anvil that got thrown into my face.  One time I flew Sidney Pollack's son into the garage.  I put out bird seed with a noose and a stick that was bent like a ricochet. 
[02:39:30]  And it grabbed me instead and flung me back and forth into rocks.  A series of unfortunate events.  What?  The sinking of the angiadoria?  I had to swim home.  What plane crash was Paula Abdul in?  I don't know.  I think that would have made news.  She's insane.  I hit rock bottom when, after every surgery, I was being told that I'd still have to face another one. 
[02:40:00]  What was she trying to say?  That this, I don't know, it doesn't tie in because she said even with the injuries, she never did drugs.  If she had injuries up to this point, believe me, they are pumping drugs in you whether you want them or not.  If you're injured in a plane crash, guaranteed there's a morphine drip on you somewhere.  But, no, she apparently, I don't know why she's explaining these wrecks.  She's saying that she's in some kind of pain, which doesn't make sense. 
[02:40:30]  Is she saying that this is causing maybe brain damage?  That makes sense.  I went through years, on average, one to two hours a day of sleep because my body couldn't get into a position that would calm itself.  There was just nothing I could do except to pray.  What'd she do this show?  One or two hours sleep?  The coke will do that to you, though.  Yeah.  She couldn't sleep.  She said that she never took painkillers, and then the whole next paragraph is about how much pain she was in for a decade. 
[02:41:00]  Maybe she should have taken some painkillers.  Stupid midget.  You go to sleep.  Like it in.  Go give Amelia West if has more money.  That's going to come out at some point, that she is on drugs.  She's going to say, well, you know, the drugs make you deny that you're on the drugs.  Did you guys see the Robbie Knievel show?  No, I missed that.  I hear it's awful.  It's good because they're all just a bunch of bitches, and Robbie Knievel just has to do this jump, like this death-defying stunt. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  And all they do is, like, fight and, like, backbite and talk behind each other.  Who's fighting?  Like his crew.  It's literally like the real world or, like, eliminate, like a bunch of fucking bitches yelling at each other.  Really?  And then Robbie, like, wakes up, rolls out, checks the ramp, goes back to bed, and they're like, I don't appreciate what you fucking said about me, man.  Really?  And they just cut to Robbie sleeping.  And he's, it's, ugh.  Cut to Anthony reading instant feedback.  That was great.  Robbie is, I think, a poor imitation of his pops. 
[02:42:00]  Evil Knievel didn't care.  None of the technology back then.  He'd jump on some motorcycle and jump over anything back in the old days.  He's, now, his son there, he's got all kinds of modern equipment measuring the ramp, the weight of the bike, the horsepower coming out of it.  Ooh!  Look at that I'm looking at.  Don't say it.  Why?  Because I will never plug anything on the show.  You know something, you might not, but King's Ransom.  I really don't want to.  Is that opening today?  I want to know personally. 
[02:42:30]  Opening today.  King's Ransom starring?  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore, ladies and gentlemen.  Nope.  Nope.  Jay Moore.  Not in it.  That's right.  The token white guy.  I see in the goddamn movie, getting the shit beat out of him by black guys.  You know what's good?  When you're the only white guy, you're never the last one on set.  Oh my God.  You show up at like 9, you have a 7 a.m. call, no one else gets here at noon.  Charlie Murphy shows up with a canned ham and a rainbow.  You're all high.  You're all smoking dust. 
[02:43:00]  Yo, Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's?  That's what the brothers call me.  Jay Moore's.  Of course.  Gotta add that S on the end.  Jay Moore's.  You listen to Opie's and Anthony?  Yeah.  It's opening today.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I know, I know.  You know.  I know you're not a plug whore.  I plug nothing.  I used to be a plug whore when I had a piece of the door.  I'd get a percentage of the door.  I'd plug.  I'd plug.  But now I'm here for my friends.  Not anymore.  We never got to the end. 
[02:43:30]  He was a real fan of the show.  Why did it take him six fucking months to go to the studio?  They're still talking about that stuff.  Such asshole.  And that was what I posted.  Message boards are just the scourge these days.  Any professional.  I don't care who they are.  I don't care.  Brad fucking Pitt sits there and trolls the message boards and looks at a critique of his  work or whatever he's doing, who he's banging, and just looks and goes, this fucking asshole.  I'm writing him back.  I'm sure they're having a field day today on the message boards. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, oh.  Let me tell you, I've previewed a couple of posts.  I would stay off the message boards for a couple of days if I were you two.  Did you just say, I would stay off the message boards.  You've got to isolate that sound.  I don't know how to go to the message boards.  I just go to Whack Bag and I'm thrilled with the Photoshop stuff.  That's where they're having all the fun right now.  Oh, yeah.  There's all kinds of speculation.  Can you guys Photoshop me putting a load on that girl?  Anything can be done.  I've got to show Cox that.  She'll love that photo.  That's great.  That miracle of the Photoshop. 
[02:44:30]  I'm sure they're working on it right now, Jay.  No, I think they're a little busy right now.  It's probably going to be backlogged.  What's Yoshi's deal?  In between pulling out still pictures from Rocky and still pictures.  Oh, really?  I'm sure.  A guy with a potato for a ball.  What's Yoshi do?  I work for Evil Angel Company.  That's a porn company.  I'm having some self-esteem and saying I'm a comic.  You're a comic.  I never knew Yoshi was a comic.  Yeah.  Until maybe two days ago.  He tried out for our last comic.  He tried out for our last comic, Danny. 
[02:45:00]  Did he?  No.  Oh.  That's dumb.  You guys all look alike.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No.  Let me tell you something.  If everybody wants to be equal, you've got to take your lumps like every other member of  society.  I can make fun of Jim Blinken and all that stuff.  I don't like it.  Well, I did that last Saturday.  Boy, they really hated me.  They were heckling me after the show.  You're a set, Mr. Jap.  They were screaming at me after the show.  You're Japanese?  I was born in Japan by my actual Korean.  You're going to get your eyes fixed.  All right. 
[02:45:30]  They were yelling at me.  I didn't see all of Yoshi's set.  I just walked in the back and I heard Yoshi say something.  I heard someone go, speak English.  And I'm like, look.  Oh, God.  My fans came out tonight.  You get a lot of hecklers yelling out racist shit?  Yeah.  Well, well deserved.  I was just eating it.  You were?  Yeah.  What's your act like?  What are you talking about growing up?  In Japan, very difficult.  What a country.  Growing up in Japan, we eat raw fish. 
[02:46:00]  Here in America, you have burgers.  What a country.  We don't have drive-to window.  What's that, Michael Keaton movie?  The fucking autoworker movie in Detroit, no?  Gung-ho?  Oh, Gung-ho.  Oh, Gung-ho.  Good call.  Oh, very good.  What's your act like?  Give us a taste.  A little sliver.  No.  Yeah, you're horrible.  Sorry, I'm really nervous.  You could totally be relaxed, dude.  You know what?  I feel really bad because Jim went out of his way to put me on the show. 
[02:46:30]  And in L.A., I almost got him and Robert Kelly getting arrested.  Do you remember this?  Oh, yeah.  They got pulled over, and this fucking nervous idiot, he's driving me and Bob Kelly around.  Uh-oh.  Bob Kelly looks like a criminal.  Yeah, he really is a little fat Samoan.  And he has to get on Dan's curb, Michael.  And we're driving through Beverly Hills, and Yoshi is a piece of shit car.  Awful.  Beverly Hills, it's glowing in Beverly Hills.  They stand out.  They absolutely stop us and pull us out of the car, and they go, you got a taillight out.  And he's fucking, I got a taillight out.  We come from the ticket club. 
[02:47:00]  Where were you tonight?  Nigasaki?  Where were you?  Having the clothing imprints taken off you?  DMZ?  Huh?  A couple of military zones?  In the back with a couple of chubby comics?  One comic looks like a fat George Michael?  Who's this guy?  What happened?  What's this guy?  You got a bald guy sitting next to a sex addict?  We got pulled over, and he is as nervous as I've ever seen anyone.  And I'm not nervous.  That's the beauty about being drug-free. 
[02:47:30]  And Bob is drug-free.  And white.  I got nothing.  And white.  I don't love the nerves.  They look in, and nerves just go, bing, bing, bing, something's up.  I don't care if they search me.  I don't get high.  I got nothing on me.  The fucking cops walk over, and he is like, oh, officer, he's getting more and more Asian with every sentence.  I just, I text a hotel.  They have two places to drop one.  He's telling us that he has to drop me and Bob off.  He stayed one hotel.  He stayed the other.  And I'm like, what are you fucking, me and Bob are laughing at him.  And he goes, well, I'm on the terrorist watch list.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:48:00]  You told the cop you're on the terrorist?  No, he told us when the cop walked away.  Because the cop was going to find it on the computer.  He's on the terrorist watch list.  Why are you on the terrorist watch list?  Look at him.  I was going up to my cousin's funeral, and I had a weapon in my back, and I forgot about it.  And I got arrested September 11, 2003, at LAX.  What a dick.  At LA with a gun?  No, a collapsible baton.  It's just a stick.  Oh, a baton.  Yeah.  I thought you had a gun.  On September 11, you forgot that you had a weapon in your bag as you got on a plane.  You're a real American, Yoshi.  That puts you on a terrorist watch list? 
[02:48:30]  I would have beat your ass myself.  That automatically puts you in.  Yeah, I went to jail for five days.  I'm the Homeland Security list.  Did they open your ass?  Yeah, they made me take all my clothes off, make me bend over.  Oh, the story gets lost.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Hey, can I read from that book?  Rent Boy?  Yeah.  Later.  Just private.  At the peninsula when we're having lunch.  Why is it so long?  Because I hear some people, they pack weapons and all of a sudden they go, oh, I didn't know  it was in here.  And then they kind of let them off the hook. 
[02:49:00]  It's a collapsible.  It's not like nail clippers.  Oh, I forgot.  It's a freaking, it's a cobra.  A collapsible baton.  For some reason, if you have a handgun, they would just take it away and you could get  on the plane.  No.  No, that's what the cops told me.  They were going to tell you whatever you needed to hear.  Wow.  So what happened?  He goes back to the car.  He comes back.  They bring us all out.  The cops are like, we're going to search you if everything's okay.  You can go.  And me and Bob are starting.  He's so fucking nervous.  Me and Bob are like, he's got dope in the car.  Oh my God.  You guys are screwed, right?  Yeah, he's got something in the car.  The cop is trying to be funny.  Because we tell them we're comics and I think they relax them. 
[02:49:30]  They know that we're not like complete sociopaths.  So we're all sitting on the outside and the cops are like, Bob's like, I got to get  on the bus.  And the cops are like, oh, you're not going to make it.  You're going to be probably spending some time with us.  And he was a real good deadpan delivery because I'm like, we're going to get fucking  arrested and have to go to county in L.A.  Oh boy.  With all these gang members.  That's right.  It's three in the morning in L.A.  A couple beautiful boys.  A couple beautiful boys.  I got to go back to the hotel because I got rehearsal the next day.  This is when I was at L.A. for the pilot.  It was horrifying.  And of course, I had no drugs on me.  Yeah.  And I would have fucking thrown him under the bus in a second.  Like, look, he just gave me a point. 
[02:50:00]  Terrorist watch list.  Grab him.  Yeah.  But it was okay.  They let us go.  They were cool.  Does the cop know you're on the terrorist watch list?  Does that come up in his cruiser?  You got to see this fucking, this is the worst credit giver, too.  Because we're all, we're sitting there.  And he's outside talking to the cop.  Me and Bob are in the car.  He's giving the cops our credits.  This fucking nervous idiot.  I hear, blah, blah, blah.  A Comedy Central.  A tough crowd.  And then he's, you know, trying to think of credits for Bob.  So he can't think of any.  Because Bob has never done any.  So he has to come back.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  And he's just.  You know.  He's just.  So what is your act like? 
[02:50:30]  Stories like that?  Yeah.  Things like that.  Yeah.  I'm just.  Wow.  You are a nervous.  Oh, he's a nervous Nelly.  You are a nervous Nakamura.  It's an odd day to come in, though.  After, you know, it was a weird.  Well, I mean, I feel bad.  I feel like I started the whole fight.  No, you didn't.  No, please.  We're fucking grown-ups.  You didn't say that.  Oh, no.  You did.  It's all your fault.  That's what you tell the kids during an argument between the parents.  It was your fault.  If you weren't so bad, this never would have happened.  This never would have happened.  How long have you been doing comedy, Yoshi?  Six years.  Six, seven, eight.  Six years.  Oh, boy.  Six years, and you're awful? 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  From Seattle.  No one asked you where you're from.  Okay.  He's a funny guy.  He's edgy.  He's vicious.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He talks about burying retarded children alive.  I mean, I kind of like that.  I like that.  And the crowd didn't give him a chance.  God's little clowns.  Wow.  No, Asians.  But, Jimmy, I did forget to tell you.  I did have movies in there.  I think that's pretty much illegal in California.  That's why I was a little worried.  Photography?  What, festiality or kiddie porn?  What did you have in there?  Shit tape. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, yeah?  What was the shit?  Was it Bob Kelly's Carson Daly set?  Which, by the way, Frosty still has on TiVo.  Oh, my God.  Poor Bob sitting there with a cast on his legs.  Oh, good.  I love Bob, but that set was fucking the first one he did on Carson.  I was running around with them big, juicy, kissable lips.  Oh, no.  All those fucking just young gangbangers staring at him.  Oh, yeah, it was a rough one.  Gangbangers.  You've got to get a copy of that.  Oh, dude, it was weird. 
[02:52:00]  Plus, you still got it on TiVo.  Nothing.  They usually laugh.  TV audience will usually give you something.  Because they don't mic the audience on Carson Daly, so it's a rough show to do to begin with.  You can have a six, and it sounds like a two.  Yeah.  And Bob was having a five, which sounded like a minus one.  Wow.  And he'll call me, dude, I had a good set.  No, you didn't, stupid.  I saw it.  All high-pitched voice and all energetic.  I saw that fat idiot.  He's back in town for one day.  I wanted him and Dane to come on the show.  They had some stuff to do in downtown.  And he's got his leg cast on, and he is miserable.  He can't walk.  Bob's going to be out of commission for a while.  But I'm just playing football. 
[02:52:30]  He pulled it playing football.  Playing football.  Playing touch football, like a true overweight, middle-aged nothing.  He invited me and our agent, Matt Frost, to go play flag football with him at Hollywood High School.  And we're playing, and it's like about an hour into the game, I realize these guys are all kind of weird.  It was a gay football league.  Really?  I throw an interception in the end zone, which that's like the Cardinals.  I go, I am a fucking faggot.  And the guy goes, you're not the only one.  And I go, what?  Everyone perked up.  Ooh, I knew it. 
[02:53:00]  Bob Adams in a gay football league.  Wow.  Flag football, L-optional.  I don't know.  It was very bizarre.  What the hell is he into?  He's into everything.  Water, milk, and Clorox.  Good call.  You like that one?  Oh, that was a good one.  Rick Crone told me that when he was licking it off my back.  Don't interrupt everybody, Yoshi.  Every two seconds.  Why are you here, Yoshi?  I've got to teach a class at 6 o'clock today.  You're on Opie and Anthony because you're teaching a class.  Oh, no.  How the fuck is this? 
[02:53:30]  You are a wreck.  I brought some porn and I brought Brandon Iron.  What kind of class are you teaching?  It's intro to porno.  Are you kidding?  Intro to porno is a class?  What kind of chicks are going to show up?  What do they show?  Childhoods and if one of them is crying, they're like, you're off to the right start.  No, Joe Gallant.  He was on the show, I think, three, four months ago with you guys and I got to give a speech  about what I do for my work.  What do you do?  I produce DVDs for you, Boy Angel. 
[02:54:00]  And where, though?  Where is this class?  Oh, I have to check my note.  Is it a legitimate school?  Yeah, it's a learning annex.  A learning annex.  I went to Joey Paisano's last night.  Yeah.  Ate like a, like I had nine rectums.  No check.  Say?  Joey's a good man.  And then he goes, you guys need a ride home?  Say?  No.  But then he sits down and watches you eat so you have to keep eating until you're sick.  Last night we're in the hotel and Cox is like, I think I'm going to be sick. 
[02:54:30]  I go, did you have like bad food?  She goes, no, he was just sitting watching me so I had to keep going.  That's funny.  Did you have that huge stuffed pork chop or something?  No, I had...  I didn't want to finish that.  It's like the Flintstones thing that tipped over the car.  I had veal Oscar and she had chicken parmesan.  Yeah, good stuff.  And the fried ravioli.  They bring out like three things without ordering.  They treat you like a king.  Yeah.  His fur is coming in the back door.  I love it.  What am I going to do with fur coats?  It's summertime.  Joey's in the back explaining how he tenderizes the veal while his head goes into his lap.  Walk right through the kitchen. 
[02:55:00]  You want me to get rid of him?  No, I don't get rid of him.  Yeah.  Sits down, talks about business.  I'd be a good Foley artist.  Lightning hits me.  Fuck you.  Pay me.  And then it started to rain.  Do we need a sponsor?  What do you mean a sponsor, Ginger?  I'll be your sponsor.  The guys at home, they didn't care what the fuck did they care as long as they were earning.  Then they brought in my baby butter, Dominic, to help out with the restaurant.  Someone else say something.  They hate when I take over.  Why?  No, you're doing a good job.  Oh, the message board doesn't like when you were? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  That was all over it, and they're like, yeah, if he would shut the fuck up once in a while,  it would be a good show.  You can't read those things.  I love it.  Bad reviews.  I love all that stuff.  Do you answer under a pseudonym or something?  Have you signed up?  I tried, and I'm not good at it.  No?  I'm not good at it.  Rich Voss is good at it.  If there's more than one step.  Racial epithets he's throwing out at people.  If there's more than one step involved.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, hey, you want to clean your computer of bugs with Norton Antisecurity?  Yeah.  Fill this out. 
[02:56:00]  Never mind.  You lost me.  Of course.  You got to go to adult friend finder, because I want to, like, all right, who needs it?  And it's like, fill this out.  Nah.  I don't need an adult friend that bad.  I'll just go to QMOV.com.  I always answer under my own name.  Always.  I don't post in a pseudonym.  It's just me.  Really?  Yeah.  Are we going to go eat after this again?  Probably not.  Cox wants to meet you.  Is she?  I guess we're eating.  Oh.  You're going to get a picture, Jimmy?  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  She's a celebrity.  Of course.  I know.  There you go.  Get a picture with her.  All right.  Jake can take it.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  Yoshi, so you work.  Yoshi's on fire, though.  Yeah, how can we break when Yoshi is just tearing up the room like this?  This is like Yao Ming talking to Patrick Ewing.  Holy moly.  Did you have a question for me?  Oh, God.  I hope not.  Oh, okay. 
[02:57:00]  I hope not.  Do you have a girlfriend, Yoshi?  No.  Oh, God, no.  With my job?  How old are you?  35.  35?  Yeah.  You guys have...  Asians don't really age.  Like, you look younger, yeah.  My mom think I look like 42, for God's sake.  Oh, you are nervous, Yoshi.  Wow.  Are you an Indian?  My mom think I'm...  That's that reflex gulp where you don't even know it's coming?  I think I...  I wasn't swallowing. 
[02:57:30]  Where did that come from?  Too dry to even throat clear.  Well, my mother think...  Get that big gulp out of nowhere.  Your throat just closes.  You're nervous.  All right.  Yoshi?  Yes.  Get the fuck out of here.  Wow.  Come on, dude.  Bring something to the table, man.  He's just nervous, Jay.  I don't give a fuck.  We're all nervous.  I'm not nervous.  Taylor Dane was nervous when she did The View.  Didn't you watch that?  No.  The remaking of Taylor Dane?  She was all nervous.  She got a trainer to be on The View. 
[02:58:00]  Really?  Tell it to her.  No.  She was, what, 80s, right?  Yeah.  All right, Yoshi.  Well, I don't know.  Opie, you better tell him thanks for coming.  I want to thank you for coming by, Yoshi.  I want to thank you, guys.  It was wonderful.  Going to let you be.  Yoshi?  All right, thanks, guys.  I haven't had this much fun watching Asians since the internment camps, but...  Yoshi?  Hmm?  I'd like to mow my lawn.  Yoshi?  Yoshi?  Well, the world needs ditch diggers. 
[02:58:30]  Okay, Pookie.  Give the class a little while.  You don't have to move to the couch live on the show.  Yeah, dude, it's just...  You wait until we go to break, and then you make believe it's just a more comfortable seat.  Yeah, then you get up, and you start talking to Big Cab, and then we come back, and you  just kind of sit down and, like, you know, quietly finish it.  Yeah, they do it on Leno and stuff.  They go to commercial, and they're still sitting in the chair.  Sometimes they go to get up, and Leno's got to tell them, no, sir.  Yeah, no, you can sit back.  Okay, go ahead.  Stay right here, man.  Well, no, now that you were sitting, don't get back in the chair.  No, now go back on the couch.  That's silly.  Yeah, you really should go back on the couch.  You should really sit back on the couch.  I guess the moment was passed. 
[02:59:00]  Not now.  You were sitting.  You were in the chair in front of the mic.  Why'd you go back to the couch?  Why are you so confused?  Jesus.  Yeah, you're so...  You want us to give you some math?  You better at it, Jesus.  Really?  What is it with you people and math?  What's the deal with that?  Come on, get on the mic and explain that.  What's the deal with you people and math?  Why are Asians so good at math?  And how come there's all these, like, Chinese...  I know you're not Chinese, but you can maybe speak for...  I don't know.  Chinese. 
[02:59:30]  What?  I know you're not Chinese.  You don't just throw around some Asian race and assume it's okay.  Chinese, Japanese, Korean...  Well, I'm walking down Mulberry Street last night and there's all these, like, Asian storefronts.  Like, how did that happen?  Don't you think the mob would be like,  Hey, Yoshi, you can't sell I'm Beautiful in Italian t-shirts?  Chinatown and Little Italy always butt up against each other like that.  They get along for some reason.  They know their lines, you know?  You know, you don't walk down Mulberry and really see a lot of Asians walking down...  Yes, you do. 
[03:00:00]  ...real walking down the street where all the restaurants are.  Yeah.  It was filthy.  I see that during the festival or nothing.  Well, they're not going to go to the festival.  There'll be a bunch of wilding.  The festival, San Gennaro.  Get the wall, Biter!  I went to San Gennaro once, and they had a booth where you throw darts at balloons,  and if you break three balloons with three darts, you win one of the prizes.  So I go there, and this, you know, of course, big fat wop behind the counter goes,  Here you go.  Yeah, here's three. 
[03:00:30]  Just try it out.  Just try it out.  Go ahead.  Try your luck.  I'm like, I don't want to do it.  It was like two bucks per dart or something.  But he goes, Just try these.  Try these.  He's on the house, on the house.  He goes, Try it.  Let me see how good you are.  So I throw, pop, pop, popped a couple of balloons, missed.  He goes, Give it another try.  So I grab him, and no money is being exchanged or anything, you know?  He's like, and there was no one at the counter.  So I figured, you know, he's just doing this to kill time.  So he's like, Come on.  You're close.  Try it again.  And I'm throwing and throwing.  Not a dollar came out of my pocket. 
[03:01:00]  I get done.  He's like, 35 bucks.  I was like, Dude, I thought.  He goes, $35.  A dollar is, like, yelling at me now.  He didn't even get to the point where he should have been yelling, and he's already yelling.  And then there I am, digging in my pocket.  Well, here you go.  There goes my sausage money.  Oh, believe me.  35 bucks back then was everything to me.  I wasn't buying fancy.  Back in 94?  Fancy stuff.  Back in 94, exactly.  Back in the day?  I think it was, like, 94 or something like that.  But, man, they rook you down there. 
[03:01:30]  Not Joey.  I've never been to it.  Never been to the festival.  Oh, it's great.  A bunch of Italians and sausage and peppers cooking all over the place.  It's one of those things that kind of makes you embarrassed to be Italian, because it's  just so Dago, so Italian.  It'd be like a black guy walking down, you know, fried chicken and watermelon stands or something.  It's that, no, it's that bad.  The big fat mamadale stirring the sausage and peppers.  Hey, yeah.  You're saying every stereotype is present. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  You're like a Jew walking down the street and just having people, like, you know, penny pinch  and steal and control banks.  They produce movies.  Produce movies.  Asians walking around and there's devoid of any sense of humor.  Giving lousy blowjobs.  Right?  Yoshi, how are you on your oral skills?  Huh?  Huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's break, Opie.  Wait. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat? 
[03:03:00]  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece  of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is, is, is, is, is a fucking rock, you dildo.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Give me bill, give me fire, give me double, turn it off! 
[03:03:30]  And we're black!  Welcome back, everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know where Opie went.  Where'd he go?  Bathroom?  He went to the bathroom.  Bathroom?  A little latrine.  A couple beautiful girls in the bathroom?  In the bedroom.  You know, the girl in that scene was, uh, Kytel's, uh, nanny.  Which one?  A couple beautiful girls.  Oh, that one?  Was his, his real nanny in real life?  Yeah, his babysitter.  What, do you want to make a movie?  Suck a cock?  Was he, and he was married at the time?  I don't know.  Something like that, because these married guys in, uh, Hollywood, they get these nannies. 
[03:04:00]  I don't know what's with their wives that allow this to happen, because they always  end up fucking their nannies.  Who did that one?  Robin Williams.  Robin Williams.  Yeah.  And now he's ready for another nanny, I think.  So, I'm working up in, uh, what is it, City Island in the Bronx?  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  And we're doing, uh, excuse me, the Ed Burns movie?  Yeah.  And this guy comes by, he's got like a Abe Lincoln beard, sunglasses, and hat.  And he goes, Jai!  I look up, he goes, you don't recognize me? 
[03:04:30]  I go, no.  He goes, it's Vinny!  I go, no.  And he goes, big pussy!  I go, well, why are you walking around in the skies asking everybody if they recognize  you?  Oh, I'm on the fucking lam now!  For what?  And he knocked out his fianc√©e.  He did?  He was on the front page of the post.  He knocked the post.  I didn't, yeah, I don't read everything.  The front page of the post said, pussy busted.  Oh, yeah.  It had to have been a weekend.  And that had to be a weekend edition because I look at the pages every day.  Underneath that was a picture of Dan Rather and it said, bad news. 
[03:05:00]  Maybe it was, maybe it was during vacation?  No, it was recently.  He got arrested.  He did.  Yeah, he belted his girl.  Belted his girl.  What did she do that made her deserve her?  You know they were arguing and she finally blurted out, you know the show has been better  since you left?  Believe me, and that's why it was.  He just drilled her in the mouth.  He goes, let me give you a key to my apartment.  You know, because we're in these little honey wagon trailers, like really low budget, like  these little tiny port-a-potty trailers.  Yeah.  And he's like, you know, you come take a nap on my futon, you can get yourself something 
[03:05:30]  to eat, you want to come up and smoke or something.  And he goes, come on, we'll go for a walk.  Is he walking around looking for friends?  I don't know what was going on, it was very bizarre and he had really long fingernails  like De Niro and Angel Heart.  Well, I don't care because Trey just gave me the fucking creeps.  Remember how good Mickey Rourke was?  It was fantastic, I heard he's too difficult to work with, he's just a wacko.  Yeah, he's insane.  I saw him on the O'Reilly Factor and he looked like a monster. 
[03:06:00]  He had some kind of cosmetic surgery done that just went awry.  It's like cosmetic surgery done via the Incredible Hulk machine or something.  He's incredible in Sin City.  Really?  In Sin City?  It's great.  Yeah, I heard that was pretty good.  Look at Eric sitting in Opie's chair.  Opie's walking in, get out of his chair.  Sex Bagel?  Yes.  Finally get to the audio.  How'd you get the name Sex Bagel?  Oh, it's a stupid story.  All right.  How about this lady that is accused of having sex with her students?  Yeah.  Who wouldn't want to pork that chin? 
[03:06:30]  She really is a fat awful.  They get progressively worse.  And look at this guy.  That's my wife.  But a 15-year-old kid has now come forward and said he initiated the whole thing.  Walked up to her and kissed her.  Look at her.  She refused him.  Which is, you know, a lie.  And right when that was taking place, somebody kind of peeked in and saw it happening.  So she got arrested.  Mickey Rourke looks like Jocelyn Wildenstein.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one, actually.  I knew she was in the paper today.  What are we doing, Ak? 
[03:07:00]  I think we want to play some stripper stuff.  Stripper audio.  All righty.  From what new show is this?  I think this was 2020.  2020.  Must be sweeps or something.  They always pull out the strippers, the sex, and the teens.  And if you could put all three of those together.  Wow.  That's a good one.  Well, we got the sex teens.  It's teen drinking.  That's what 60 Minutes did.  Yeah.  They know what works.  They always condemn, well, shows like ours when we touch on things that are like, oh,  this is awful.  Talk about sex and teens. 
[03:07:30]  It's like, well, when push comes to shove and they need ratings, they know what to parade  out.  They pull out the specials on junior high school sex and strippers.  So I guess they were doing this stripper expose.  Yeah, I guess just talking to strippers.  Great.  Getting to know them, you know, because they have so much to say.  Fucking strippers.  Let's go with the first clip here.  A lot of people think that dancers are all either sexually abused as kids, or there's something 
[03:08:00]  wrong with them, or they're partying all the time, or they're prostitutes, or they're drunk  every night.  Word Up by Cameo playing in the background.  Word Up.  Was it really?  Yeah.  Well, that is the...  Am I the only one paying attention around here?  Dude, this show fell...  The wheels fell off hours ago.  Jumped track.  We're just trying to, like, get to the 11 o'clock.  Who are you kidding? 
[03:08:30]  He's glancing up.  I'm looking at my watch.  What's fucking...  The train jumped the track.  There was a black girl working at one of daddy's clubs, Lady E.  The wreckage hasn't stopped rolling.  I'm waiting for Jim to finish the bathroom so I can go in so it's not the awkwardness.  No.  Hey.  It's just the worst.  Do you just do the way you look, kind of purse your lips a little and go nod your head?  No, because it's just...  There's just nothing?  It's beyond awkward, though.  Thank God there's a weekend.  We walked out together.  Here's how you know it's tense.  Because I went to the urinal and he went into the stall. 
[03:09:00]  Normally we piss next to each other.  Yeah.  Thank God there's a weekend coming up.  You just kind of diffuse this a bit.  I just don't...  Here, this will.  A celebrity fart.  There you go.  I'll show you more.  I just got a really bad headache now, you know?  Do you?  I'm really bad.  That's my own problem, though.  How do you feel about the Jets getting hugged jolly?  Jesus, Jay.  Jeez, that's a bad one, dude.  Yeah, well, it's a fart.  Yeah, but sometimes they're not bad.  Yeah, sometimes they're really good. 
[03:09:30]  Sometimes the inside of your ass is like potpourri.  Sometimes they don't smell.  They're never good.  But sometimes they're just nothing.  Is that a show promo?  No.  They're never good, but sometimes they're just nothing.  Right.  Opie and Anthony.  So what do you got planned for the weekend?  I don't know, really.  Yeah?  Probably going to Long Island, I guess.  Yeah?  Mellow out for a while.  Yeah, sure.  No?  Not hanging out?  Doing my sets.  No, he's got the big... 
[03:10:00]  Jimmy's doing the big HBO thing next week.  Yeah.  Because that's going to be the next stupid speculation, Monday and Tuesday.  You're going?  Monday and Tuesday.  Yeah, I'll go.  It's not that...  It's not a fucking...  I understand.  It's not a deal break or anything.  I'm just...  I'm just...  I'm the voice of the people, Opie.  It's just one of those things, and we'll work it out, whatever.  It's just...  What's your pilot?  It's actually...  It's a special...  It's a half-hour stand-up.  No, he's doing HBO on Tuesday.  So here's the speculation that's going to start.  Jimmy's not going to be here Monday and Tuesday. 
[03:10:30]  It's because he's getting ready for HBO.  Oh, no.  Now there's going to be all kinds of speculation.  Of course there will.  But I talked to him yesterday.  I wanted those days because I wanted to get my sleep or I want to sleep late like I was  always doing.  No, we...  That has nothing to do with what happened today.  Trust me.  We totally get it and understand.  Man, if we didn't say that, though...  I know.  That's what I want to say.  There's no Jimmy here.  That's what I want to say because I...  You know, stop.  Enough.  Should have done that.  And now they're taking sides.  Enough.  Just relax.  That would have been really cool to come in, not acknowledge that Jimmy's not here, and not even  talk about Jimmy. 
[03:11:00]  Not mention it.  Not mention it.  Nice.  Oh, boy.  They would have...  Bill Burr joining us again in the studio.  He did a good job on the show.  Yeah, he's very funny.  Bill's fun.  Yeah.  All right.  And I thanked him properly, by the way.  Stop it.  Play the goddamn audio.  Put your boat in the ring.  Give your boat to fucking beat and let you fuck each other.  No.  Get blood all over my contract.  Get used to that.  All right.  Here we go.  Another clip from the stripper special on 2020.  Did we have any comments about the first one?  Not really.  Oh, well, she was talking about a lot of people think strippers are abused as children, and 
[03:11:30]  that's why they end up in that.  What do you think they had to pay?  Would they find the one that wasn't?  They had to pay for Cameo Word Up.  What was this on?  What channel?  2020.  I think they could afford it.  I don't know.  ABC, right?  You've got to pay money for Cameos playing like the whole song's playing in the background.  I think they could swing it.  I think it's in the budget.  I think...  Is there anyone alive from Cameo?  Are you concerned about their budget or something this year?  Yeah, just, you know.  Damn it.  You know, a former executive producer having a nickel and dime every freaking thing in 
[03:12:00]  the world.  Oh, you have to deal with stuff like that when you're producing these things?  Yeah, more than anything.  So, like, during Last Comic Standing, what were some of the things you had to deal with  that you thought you would never have to deal with?  The theater thing is like, well, you've got to pay six guys to stand there because it's  a union house and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Like, well, I'll have my own...  I'll have another producer intro me.  Like, he can't say, ladies and gentlemen, Jay Moore, because he's not a union guy.  He's fucking talking to a mic.  Yeah, but you've got to be union.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Where do they give you a set amount of money and it's your job to stay within those... 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  Here's the guy, by the way, not to interrupt you with that they executed.  This is the helicopter crash.  Oh, animals.  On CNN.  In Iraq.  Animals.  They're greeting us with flowers and chocolates.  Helicopter crash or we're shot down.  Mission accomplished.  Oh, then, of course, they don't show the shooting of the hostage.  Why would you?  That's the important part of it.  It was a survivor.  Yeah, yeah, a survivor.  Animals.  Mission accomplished.  In front of him in the field.  He's injured.  He's on the videotape saying, you know, if they could help him out. 
[03:13:00]  Gets up and they shoot him.  Mission accomplished.  What are you worried about?  Mission accomplished.  All right.  Back to the strippers.  We're not mean enough.  Yeah.  What else we got?  I mean, do you think, like, some girls just strip because they just enjoy it, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what we took away from that clip.  I'm sorry, guys, but Miss Puerto Rico got sentenced to a year of probation for shoplifting.  That's big news.  Breaking down that stereotype, huh?  Thank you.  Clip number two, please.  All right. 
[03:13:30]  I'm Trina.  Trina.  Hi, I'm Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah, it's a wonderful show.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you from here?  Where are you from?  I'm from Israel.  Ooh, nice dance.  You put on your naughty pants to come out and play, huh?  Ugh, this is why...  Give me your money.  This is why I hate going to these places.  Oh, that babble is just...  Yeah, all of a sudden I want to leave.  As soon as I hear the phoniness in the voice, I'm taking out of this scene.  Ooh, those pants.  They shut up.  What'd you say you brought your sexy pants?  Yeah, your what pants?  Your naughty pants?  Your...  What did she say? 
[03:14:00]  You know, you're just wearing sweat pants so we can get a handjob.  Your pants with money in the pockets.  That's all she cares about.  Trina.  Hi, I'm Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah, it's a wonderful show.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Where are you from?  I'm from Israel.  Ooh, nice pants.  You put on your naughty pants to come out and play, huh?  You put on your naughty pants to come out and play.  What do you think?  Shut up.  What do you think of the kind of pants the guy had on?  The Butterfugo sweats where you can get a handjob.  Yeah, the pup tent ones.  Either that or he was wearing those crotchless chaps village people wear. 
[03:14:30]  Those are naughty pants.  I bought these at a kiosk at the Wheeling Wolf.  Yeah.  I just hate the phony small talk.  When I go to strip club, I just want them naked.  I want them naked and kind of moving around.  Don't even dance too, you know, don't be too good at the dancing.  Just swing on the pole, walk around.  Or when you get in the lap dance, as soon as the song's over, it's like they...  What happened?  You farted back?  Yeah, I didn't want to mention it.  Oh, God.  You're really bad, right?  Right. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, God.  Ask me, is it bad?  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Sorry, but you came in here trying to bully people with your gasses.  You had to be fucking brought right back down to earth.  Holy shit.  Ask me if it's bad.  Is it bad?  As opposed to good?  Oh, my God.  Wow, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Jesus.  It's worse than tippy-toe.  Okay.  What do you eat that you fart constantly?  Like, what's your deal?  I don't know.  I had some coffee. 
[03:15:30]  Just oyster patties.  Oh, yes.  Oyster patties.  Oh, God.  Doodoo mints and oyster patties.  Wow, is that horrible?  I had some eggs this morning, some coffee, and all the tension just made my body rebel.  Wow.  I got scared.  Hey, Kev, will you hand me my water, please?  It's like you shoved a catalytic converter up a chest.  Punch my thirst?  Oh, I thought it had something to do with the fart.  I don't know.  Jimmy's ass makes me thirsty. 
[03:16:00]  Sustained my life.  Maybe you had it's water.  Maybe you had something that we could take with us after you leave to help the situation here.  Some kind of miracle cure with the water.  I put it in my satchel, and I save it for the next level of EverQuest.  When I was riveting radio, Anthony talking about a fucking video game for an hour and a half.  Hey, a lot of people are into video games, Jay.  Yeah, that'll put me right to Hank's place.  Oh, man.  We lost out to Hank's place?  Hank's place is actually pretty funny.  I don't know if it's supposed to be funny.  I went there because you said your mom listens to it, and then I went, and then I really liked it. 
[03:16:30]  It's cool, right?  Yeah.  They're out of their minds over there.  Very patriotic.  They're wacky.  It's amazing that we're part of the same country.  Oh, God, the smell won't go away.  Yeah, that's a really bad one.  You really stunk up the studio, Jim.  I didn't mean to.  You really stunk it up.  You didn't mean to.  You farted.  I just got nervous.  It slipped out.  Comedy Connection next weekend?  Next weekend, yeah.  29th 30th.  You going to go see a movie tonight?  No, I got to do sets all weekend, man.  Oh, I didn't even go see this movie.  No.  Yeah, brand new. 
[03:17:00]  Come on.  Oh, you know, I actually like to see what it's called.  What's it called?  Hitch.  King's Ransom.  Hitch.  King's Ransom.  Hitch.  King's Ransom.  The only reason he went in studio is to get that fucking movie coming out.  He left the boys out to dry.  Six months?  If he's such a friend of the show, why do you wait six months?  Oh, I can't wait to get on Wackbag Land.  Who the fuck does Norton think he is?  Oh, believe me, it's going to be awful.  Oh, it's going to be a big one.  Oh, it's going to be this.  Now, is there ways to get more in?  Like, I go to the front page of Wackbag.  Yeah.  And then I'll click only, like, it says my name in, like, the thread thing. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  But, like, what you're on right now, what's that?  Oh, this is instant feedback.  This is people instantly commenting on the show.  And, boy, is it entertaining.  Pat from Monaki is even not funny in print.  It has been very entertaining all day long.  A lot of Metallica references coming in.  It'll be fine.  Let's all relax.  Don't, don't, don't.  All right.  More stripper clips?  Yeah, more stripper clips.  That one, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  The whole small talk.  The annoying small talk thing.  The whole small talk.  They just got to get up there and be naked.  And then when your lap dance song ends and they just, like, that's it.  Yeah.  Clothes go back on.  They should fade out a little bit.  They walk away.  Their face all of a sudden goes from smiling, sexy, to the straight, you know, business.  Here we go.  Where's my money?  I love when they give you the lap dance and they go to the next guy and they lap dance  and they look back over his shoulder at you like, uh, like, I miss you and I'm just  doing this because I need to pay my rent.  But with you, it's something real.  Fucking whores. 
[03:18:30]  What's your name?  I'm Trina.  We have something real.  Claire.  Fucking fake name who is.  All right.  Here's another clip.  Summer.  I don't think you make a lot of money by pretending to be stupid or pretending to be  smarter than you are or trying to fake a connection with someone.  I really think it's all about the individual.  No.  Actually, I treat them all the same.  They're all called Big Daddy.  Yeah, the joke's on us.  It gets me upstairs every time. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, the joke's on us.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dance.  Whore.  Yeah, I'm with you.  Because people go, oh, you dropped $400 in a strip club.  They got you.  It's like, no, she showed me her pussy for $20.  I got her because I got a lot more $20.  Yeah.  You got one pussy and you got to share it for the rest of your career, you hilly.  You got a little piece of her dignity.  Yeah.  And she only has a limited supply that probably ran out years ago.  Ugh.  They, I love how they ratchet it.  Because any stripper show you see, you get two of these whores together in a room. 
[03:19:30]  They will talk about how, oh, it's so funny to watch the guys come in and we just work  them and take, believe me, we're fine with it, ladies.  You're the ones crying into your pillow at night.  Ooh.  Because you're, ooh, there is a fart war going on over there that I don't want to be part  of.  Not bad.  I do not.  Biting animal, please.  Biting at the air.  And laugh at those farts.  Come on, kids.  Biting at the air.  Don't get in the major leagues and fucking throw that.  Are you animal? 
[03:20:00]  I don't give credit for rattling your shoulder by putting it on you.  Yeah, not at all.  There's nothing to me.  Snipping his shoulder.  There's nothing to me.  There's nothing.  There's nothing to me.  This is great.  I'm going to be caught in the collateral damage.  It means nothing to me.  The shrapnel.  But Vietnam veterans farting don't mean nothing to us.  You don't think I, this guy wants to fart so big.  I was trying to do.  Is it bad?  As opposed to good?  All right.  We need to get in touch with Joe.  Joe.  Joe will make it right.  Let's not start sucking each other's dicks just yet, gentlemen. 
[03:20:30]  This coffee's very good.  Next clip.  Jewels.  Next clip.  Uh, yeah.  All right.  Honestly, you look for the vulnerable ones.  The really cute guy, the cocky guy.  We talked to them last, their last pick.  So you want to look at the guy who probably doesn't get that much love or affection or whatever.  And then you try to fulfill that need.  You know, you try to make them feel better about themselves, smarter, stronger, whatever. 
[03:21:00]  And then you're compensated for that.  Ugh.  Oh, stop it.  So they go to the sap.  Yeah.  That's sitting there.  The vulnerable ones.  Although there are, you know, the set guys that are at the strip clubs.  And you can point them out right when you walk in.  These are the ugly women that, I'm sorry, these are the ugly women that Cosby apparently groped.  The guy's got a billion dollars.  He's groping ugly white women.  Tamara Green is a white woman?  As opposed to black? 
[03:21:30]  Cosby actress.  And they got pictures of him with a little girl.  That's nice.  Hey, look, it's little Rudy.  I'd like to touch you, pussy.  And grab your lips.  Say, take the vacatine and bend over.  Not so, Raven.  Rudy, get in here and sit on the Cos's lap. 
[03:22:00]  Who saw Angel Heart?  I don't know what impression I'm doing.  Rudy looks like she has some Jell-O pudding under her lip.  Above her lip.  What a tool.  I don't know what.  What?  Want to put some road flares down and work that construction up?  Put some cones down, we'll wave off traffic.  Wave off traffic.  Let me work on this here.  Wow.  Me and Hopi, me and Ed bumping heads.  Two men crushed to death on their way to the same punchline.  Trampled each other. 
[03:22:30]  Rushing for the same punchline.  Oh, shit.  What?  I didn't even catch it.  It was a mess-up.  She had it under her lips.  Yeah, you ever see little Rudy on the Cosby show?  She was the only five-year-old girl with a full mustache.  Yeah.  I didn't know about her dumped alone on her lip.  And I was like, what difference?  Does it matter what lip?  See, you didn't want her to have a soul patch.  You wanted her to have a little black child mustache.  A little, uh...  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Mustache.  What a mess.  Black child mustache.  Next stripper clip, please.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  The big money customers, they want to come in and spend time with a beautiful girl.  They want the fantasy to think that, you know, oh, gee, this girl really likes me.  You know, that's...  They know it's a lie because, you know, it's like, oh, here's...  Lie to me some more.  Lie to me some more.  Is that Yoshi?  Maybe they're looking for love.  I don't know what they're looking for, but they can come into the club.  They can get to know the girl.  And any time they want to get up and leave, they can get up and leave. 
[03:23:30]  Don't make so much of it.  They're looking for the love and the fantasy.  No.  You're a man paying money to see a nude woman's body.  That's it.  Some of the guys are stupid, but some of them are stupid, and they really think the girls like them.  They'll come in with $10,000 and hand it to her.  That is so rare as opposed to the multitude of men that are going in after work to these strip clubs  that just want to see some pussy hang out and drink an overpriced beer.  They want to see pussy hang out?  Yeah, see pussies hang out. 
[03:24:00]  It's not about, you know, sitting there and fantasize.  Yeah, she's wrapped around you asking you to pay for her $25 fucking drink.  Yeah, that's the fantasy.  That's the fantasy you want to slip into.  I love when they ask you if you want to buy the girl a drink, and I'm going, no.  Yeah, she's drinking a champagne.  I want a lady's drink.  Here, bend over and I'll give you some.  Champagne cocktails.  Sierra Mount.  Whatever they say, I want a lady's drink, you should just blow one in their mouth.  Here's what ladies drink. 
[03:24:30]  They'll lick it off the rug.  Here's a clip on stripper etiquette.  You know the rules of etiquette?  Well, number one, if you're sitting with a customer, another girl should not walk up and talk to the person that you're talking to.  If you're dancing at a stage, don't go to the guy that's sitting around the stage.  She's taking money out of my baby's mouth.  Oh.  Very simple.  What?  Well, what if it's my sister and I want to talk to her?  Taking money out of my baby's mouth? 
[03:25:00]  That's nice.  She's one of those dancers with the big C-section scar that do so well.  The day clubs out on Long Island.  You think they even try to hide it?  You know, they don't.  Oh, no, they're proud of it.  You grow a huge bush and comb it up.  A comb over a bush.  Yeah, get a big cesarean scar bush roll-up.  Or get a tattoo over it.  You have a C-section.  Your stripper days are over.  No, unfortunately not.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm trying to spread the knowledge here.  I see pornos with C-section scars. 
[03:25:30]  Porno's a different thing, though.  It's porno.  That's almost acceptable.  It's like, look, she's getting railed in the ass.  You know, you're not looking so much at the woman's body as to what's ravaging, you know,  how it's being ravaged.  You go to a strip club, you want to see a nice body up on the stage.  You don't want to see some slob come out with a baby belly and this big C-section scar.  No, I don't go for that, man.  No.  I draw the line.  I like big meat, but I like the stomach to be cool.  Those are the girls you see dancing, and when you leave the club, you're leaving like Frankenstein 
[03:26:00]  walking out of the building.  You know, the sunlight hits your eyes.  It's too bright.  They're never night dancers.  Never the dancers that are there during the hours that they're supposed to be.  It's the lunch crowd that comes in, the Puerto Rican laborers that are watching some slob  with a C-section, and they've got to get back out to work.  This makes her $10.  Let's go to Jersey and talk to Tom.  Tom?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Tom?  None.  My buddy of mine, he went to a strip club. 
[03:26:30]  He spent like fucking $600.  I didn't answer that kind of language.  And what?  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm a little nervous.  Go.  No, he spent like...  Dude, dude, dude.  Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.  Jesus.  You're fucking Paul Peter out.  Yeah, Tom, relax.  You're only talking to about, I don't know, about three or four million people across America.  It's no big deal.  Let her rip.  All right, let her rip.  Thanks.  Don't think of all the people listening right now.  I'm listening to your every word.  My friend.  It's really no big deal if you think about it, okay? 
[03:27:00]  All right.  All right, calm down.  Here we go.  Let her mother in the ass.  All right.  Well, my buddy, he's a volunteer firefighter.  And he goes to the strip club.  And this Russian chick...  Breathing heavy?  $600 on her.  $600.  Why are you more nervous the second time?  You are really breathing heavy, sir.  Well, then what happened after the $600?  That's the whole story?  Well, you know, he kind of fell in love with the chick.  I go with her a lot.  I know it's your first call to the show, but I've got to be honest.  It stunk. 
[03:27:30]  On ice, my friend.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's all right.  You let Jimmy down, you know.  Yes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What's the strip club?  Where is it?  We'll go visit this girl and we'll steal her from him.  It's Delilah's in Tom's River.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Sounds like a classic here.  Tom, you can take this with you.  You were still better than Yoshi, okay?  Wow.  Hey, Sophie, you rock, man.  Go get some water for that cotton mouth now.  You hear his tongue smacking on his teeth. 
[03:28:00]  Cotton mouth.  All right, let's hit another one here.  Why busboys get benefits and not strippers?  The busboy is getting a wage and benefits,  and the dancers are the people they're coming to see,  and they're not getting a wage and they're not getting benefits.  In fact, they're paying to go to work.  Right.  Well, but they're making...  Well, does it?  The busboy goes home with $200 a week or $300 a week,  and the dancer goes home with $3,000 to $6,000. 
[03:28:30]  So what will you say to a dancer who isn't cutting it?  Is it making enough money?  I try to encourage her to, you know,  I call it broaden your career horizon a little bit.  Find something that you're good at,  something that, you know, because this isn't it for you.  Ah, this ain't it.  Who's this bitch that's interviewing everyone at the strip club?  Oh, God damn it.  Dude, that's awful.  I cannot take the smell in here.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Stop.  I just got sad that it came out. 
[03:29:00]  Stop it.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's so bad.  It smells like victory.  This war must end.  Hell of a war.  PBR Street Gang, this is Mother Goose.  Dumball, you're made a firepower within my compound.  For the record, it's my call.  Hell of a war.  The best part of Platoon is when Oliver Stone gets blown up by the guy with the grenade. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, when he runs into the bunker?  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  That animal runs in the bunker with that bag of explosives.  What a great movie.  Yeah, that's a good one.  You're a killer, buddy.  That don't mean I don't like a good piece of pussy once in a while.  And I don't like a good piece of pussy, except maybe the Indy 500.  Dude, I got to interrupt.  The Photoshop's are coming in.  Really?  They are really funny.  It's me and Jimmy looking really angry in the background, and you're sitting there, and  the caption says, I love you both, so I want to make this right. 
[03:30:00]  We'll need a porch and some marshmallows.  It's chasing Opie.  Ah, that's funny.  Smart-ass pricks.  All right.  Well, so she makes ten times more money than the busboy.  Yeah, but she wants the benefits.  But the busboy doesn't have a pussy.  The interviewer has a problem that the stripper's not getting insurance.  You know how many people have to buy their own insurance?  Yeah.  Come on.  She can afford to get her own insurance.  No problem.  I'm sure the busboy would trade salaries in a second. 
[03:30:30]  Okay, respect my body.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  I've ended dances.  I have told them, look, I'm sorry, if you don't stop, I'll get up and walk away.  And I actually have.  Keep your money on gone.  Keep your money on gone.  Well, that girl lets me do it.  Okay, go get a dance from her.  I don't need to do that.  Do you lose business that way?  Sure, but I'm not losing me.  Oh, stop it.  Why are you so strict with that if other girls aren't?  We can lose our jobs, for one. 
[03:31:00]  Not to mention the fact that, you know, respect me.  I'm respecting you.  Respect me.  My body.  Wow.  They just want to latch on to any little tidbit of dignity or respect or anything that is just gone.  No guy is walking in there and respecting you.  The guy that you turn around to and say, don't do that.  Like, I don't know, what is he, rubbing her ass or something?  The guy that probably touched her or something, yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  When you tell him, if you do that, I'm going to walk away, he's not looking at you and going,  wow, you know, maybe I was wrong.  I have a newfound respect for this girl.  You're going, fuck you, whore.  That's why you're in here.  That's why I'm paying you.  Yeah, don't get a dance from her.  She's classy.  Yeah.  She's, you know something, if you want to dance where you can stick your thumb up her ass,  go to that girl there.  But if you want to sit there and look at a girl you can really respect, you go to this one.  She's a go-getter. 
[03:32:00]  It's going to end like a movie.  She's just going to go through this and get a great job at a good firm with a good wage and insurance  and show everybody.  How about when you go in the VIP room and they get the black lights on,  you see how fucking filthy your t-shirt is?  I'm like, oh my God, I had no idea.  I was covered in so much shit.  You need 20 lint combs, lint brushes to get the spock off you.  How about Carson Daly's jacket?  Looks like the bookworm from Batman on Ellen. 
[03:32:30]  Carson's on Ellen.  He's on David Spade.  Jesus, he lost weight.  Hey, we got a phone call from Flower Boy in Jersey.  Flower Boy.  We haven't taken many calls today.  Hello, Flower Boy.  This is the Flower Boy.  Yeah, we got a loser here in Jersey that sends about $300, $400 worth of flowers to this stripper  and leaves his phone number, his office phone number, his cell number, everything.  Call me.  I'm not saying there ain't saps and suckers and delusional idiots out there,  but the majority of guys just look and go, I'm paying you to see you naked. 
[03:33:00]  There's nothing more there.  Hey, let's start a stripper union.  Yeah, that's it.  I actually know a woman in California.  She's an author.  She wrote a book.  She did unionize or tried to unionize them in San Diego.  Really?  Yeah.  For the same reason.  That must be some hot strippers in San Diego.  That guy should add stuff to the card.  If he's delivering the flowers, he should be like, I'm going to stab your fucking throat.  You dumb bitch.  Wait till I slit your throat ear to ear.  Enjoy the flowers.  Let's go back to Jersey and say hi to Sean. 
[03:33:30]  Sean, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Hey, Pastor Waltz.  Hi, Angel.  Why don't they explain this stripper's etiquette to these Russian broads out here in Jersey?  I mean, you don't even put your keys on the bar two seconds before they're all over you.  You want to lap dance?  I give you a special lap dance.  They all smell like raw cabbage.  Pushy Russian whores.  That are the worst.  You know, you used to be able to walk into a strip club and get a nice American girl whose life went wrong,  and you could just sit there and watch a nice American girl dance. 
[03:34:00]  Now it's these pushy Russian chicks that, yeah, they're just, they crawl on you for the money.  Where the money?  Money.  Get out of here.  Ugh.  All bruised and banged up.  They smell like female cologne and like this cabbage kind of raw garbage kind of smell.  Yeah.  You want me to make sexy for you?  They got those brown, unfiltered cigarette borders around their teeth.  One of them did a good old days where a nice white girl comes up and says, 
[03:34:30]  Hi, my uncle fingered me.  Want to dance?  There you go.  Wonderful.  I will make so sexy for you.  I will make this sexy for you.  Look, Moscow on the Hudson.  Beat it.  Leave.  They're not even, it's not, you want an American girl.  Apple pie.  Right.  Coca-Cola.  Baseball, Ant.  Baseball.  That's what you want.  Uncle finger.  That's right, especially if it's your niece. 
[03:35:00]  Couple beautiful girls.  Here comes the last track and it's the biggest lie in the whole special.  Club owner talking about prostitution and how it's unlikely happening.  Oh, sure.  They look private, but they're not, I mean, it's perception of privacy.  There's no real privacy.  We'll have people walking this floor.  The waitresses come and go on a regular basis.  Are you sure that prostitution isn't happening in any of your clubs?  You know, I'm not saying that it never happens.  Is it likely?  No.  Because most people have the perception that it does happen in every club. 
[03:35:30]  You know, somewhere if I pay somebody enough money, I can go someplace and buy sex.  They're going to have to do it really fast because there's going to be somebody coming  around checking on that room.  And if they get interrupted, they're going to be thrown out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's not even strip clubs.  You can work at IBM and hand your secretary ten grand and go suck my dick.  Yeah.  Are you sure there's not prostitution going on?  It's Barnes and Noble?  Like in New Orleans when I snuck off during the broadcast and whacked off with a box in  my face?  Yeah.  God, that was fantastic. 
[03:36:00]  See?  150 bucks, 200 bucks it cost me.  A lot of money.  You paid a girl?  Yeah.  Big lips.  Yeah, that's the only reason I did it.  They were big.  I saw them bulging while she was dancing.  She was dancing on stage and I saw the bulge and I think I physically salivated.  When girls pee on you, do you masturbate when it happens or do you just take it?  I don't get it.  What am I supposed to do?  No, but I don't understand the whole thing.  What else am I going to do with my hands?  Hold up a mirror and realize how far my life has gone?  Yeah.  There's a little Jimmy Norton.  No, of course I whack my bag.  Write a suicide note. 
[03:36:30]  But what is it about mom and dad?  My breath smells like popcorn.  Can't take it anymore.  What is it about piss that gives you an erect?  I don't get it.  I don't know either, to be honest with you.  Now, how did you, were you a child?  Oh yeah, I liked the smell when I was a kid.  I liked the smell.  I used to smell this girl's crotch and it would smell like pee and I would enjoy it.  True.  What about like being at a urinal, like at a Giants game where you're like, oh my God.  That's nothing for me, no.  So is there a different smell between girl pee and boy pee?  I don't know what boy pee smells like, but it's girl pee that I like.  Good answer.  I don't, I have no idea. 
[03:37:00]  I mean, I know my own piss smells like, but it's about the psychology too.  There's something sexy about it to me, but it's never a conscious thing.  Sexy because you're being degraded?  No, I don't feel so.  I'm not a married judge.  No, I'm a perv.  I don't feel naughty.  I'm not like, oh, oh, yell at me.  You know, just whiz on me and then beat it.  Get out.  Give me your golden gift.  I'll drink it and you go home.  What's GFE stand for?  Girlfriend experience.  Okay, and what's the other one?  Give me all the, oh, fuck.  Give me a million of them.  GFE is girlfriend experience, because that means they'd probably kiss.  That one I knew, but, oh, damn it. 
[03:37:30]  PSE?  I do not know.  Public service something?  I don't know.  Parks Department?  Yeah, I never heard of PSE.  If you're fucking attired, that might come in handy.  Is that him?  It's PSI.  I knew that that was wrong, because nobody else picked up on it.  I'm like, somebody else would have said that.  Let's go to Kentucky.  Dexter, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going today?  Hi, Dexter.  What do you think?  Hell, sounds like y'all having problems in there. 
[03:38:00]  What do you do, psychologist?  I'm a damn truck driver.  Oh, okay.  What's up, Dexter?  Hey, first-time caller, buddy.  I've never called before, and I used to listen to Howard all the time.  Since I got XM about a week and a half ago, I've turned y'all on and enjoyed listening to you all.  And as far as that damn dragon wagon goes, why don't he go to a rest area and get ass-raped by Pickle Park Pete? 
[03:38:30]  Oh, Pickle Park Pete.  I remember the Pickle Park Pete.  That's the gay guys that hang out at the truck stops looking to maybe service the guys for a little extra money.  Or you can call him a fucking faggot.  He's a fucking faggot.  Wait, I'll say.  Is he cutting out?  What'd you say?  Fucking dragon wagon's a fucking faggot.  It sounds so natural coming out of that mouth.  You just picture a young boy in Wyoming tied to a fence.  But he'd say that to a gay guy.  I don't mind. 
[03:39:00]  You're a fucking faggot.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  I don't care what you fucking faggot to do.  Everyone is saying PSE is porn star experience.  Oh.  Oh, really?  I never heard that.  Maybe it is.  Hey, Jim.  Please, sir.  Jim, you there?  I'm right here, sir.  Won't you just go over there and give Opie a big old kiss to Mike?  Guys, this is terrible.  Love listening to y'all.  I'm punching the hell out.  I've got to go do some work.  Thank you, Dexter.  Dexter, we'll be fine.  Bye, sweetie.  Let's go to Bill.  Hey, Bill.  How you doing? 
[03:39:30]  Pretty good.  I just want to ask Norton something real quick.  Norton, what's the tea thing that you get into?  Because I'm kind of into it.  But I'm only into it when my wife drinks.  You know, so it's like an alcohol pee.  So it's kind of clear and not smelly.  Do you like that morning coffee pee?  Well, to be honest, I have the asterisk is that I'm an alcoholic.  And this honestly is the one consideration I have is alcohol and drugs in the system.  I mean, sometimes I'm sure it's there, but I don't want to know it.  Do you think it would actually do anything to you?  I don't know, but I just don't want it in my body at all.  I know, believe me, the inconsistencies there, I know.  Well, you're a health nut. 
[03:40:00]  You know me.  I don't like any impurities in my urine.  I'm sure most of the escorts coming over aren't drinking or doing drugs.  I know.  Believe me.  Just eating asparagus.  Yeah, right.  They're not exactly health food workers.  They're all just fucking junkie whores who are booting up in my elevator and then tinkling on me  and crying to my Spanish boyfriend.  What's your address?  What's that?  What's your address?  I can't give you my address, but I'll give it to you off air.  Why not?  Well, you didn't even call me back.  Do you have a tarp that you use or something?  Dude, if you understood, if you could see me duct taping plastic bags.  Like garbage bags? 
[03:40:30]  Plastic garbage bags?  Yeah, in my garbage bags and then taping them to the fucking bathtub.  If you understood what you think when you're untaping bags from your floor.  Do you kind of go up the wall a little bit?  Is that what you do?  So it doesn't run off onto the floor?  Yeah, yeah.  You got it all figured out.  I picked up the bags and had the tape fall through and gotten it all over the floor.  I've had some real problems.  The cleanup must be embarrassing.  It's awful.  It's bad enough, especially when you're a kid and you're jacking it, to have to clean up  after you're done because it feels all dirty.  That's why I always just dumped it on my stomach.  Me too, and I'd fall asleep and leave the sheets on. 
[03:41:00]  But even that, you got to clean up.  I don't clean that up.  You don't have to use a corkscrew to pull it out and give me a belly button.  Yeah, I do.  John in New York City.  What's up, John?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  There is one definition that I see on these escort sites.  It's probably from Norton.  It's DFK.  What is it?  Deep French kissing.  Oh, so it's kind of on the other end.  Ew.  All right, thanks.  Almost like girlfriend experience.  All right.  Wamp, wamp, wamp.  Well, it's the weekend. 
[03:41:30]  Jay Moore, thank you so much for coming in.  King's Ransom opening tonight.  No, it doesn't.  Next week.  King's Ransom starting.  Is it next week?  Nope.  Don't know.  It's opening tonight.  Nope.  It's Friday, so the movie's opening.  Boycott King's Ransom.  King's Ransom.  Boycott Black Atkins.  Boycott Jay Moore.  Great friend of ours.  Great friend of the show.  Love having him in here.  Jay Moore.  I think we should all go around the room and thank him personally.  Want to thank Yoshi?  Oh, yeah.  Let's not forget to thank Yoshi.  Absolutely nothing to the program.  Holy moly.  And Brandon from that thing.  We'll see you Monday. 
[03:42:00]  Bag it.  Later.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
