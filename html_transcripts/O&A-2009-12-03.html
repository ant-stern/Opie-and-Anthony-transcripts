<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a heated recounting of a recent interview with Jesse Ventura that ended with Ventura’s abrupt departure.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with guest Jim Norton, detailed the escalating tension, noting Ventura's confrontational behavior – pushing away the microphone and physically patting one of the hosts – before his angry exit.  They discussed the resulting online backlash, focusing on criticisms of the video’s editing and comments from various fan bases.  Ventura later called in to apologize.  This segment also included discussion of a Marilyn Monroe marijuana video, a caller’s critique of the Ventura segment as a “debate” rather than an “interview,” and extensive, vulgar commentary on Tiger Woods’ infidelity scandal, including speculation about his wife’s actions and media coverage. Other topics included a ridiculously overweight airplane passenger, the hosts' opinions on swine flu, and a hockey highlight showing a player hitting his own goalie.  Bill Burr called in, offering his perspective on the Tiger Woods situation and the absurdity of celebrity scandals.  "McLovin," wearing a Batman sweatshirt, was repeatedly mentioned as being visible in the background of the Ventura interview footage.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez needing coaching on how to slide, prompting mockery of New York sportswriters.  This led to fantasizing about a Maxim model/flight attendant (Linda) and suggesting having members of the Jets flight crew on the show.  Bill Burr briefly reappeared, mentioning upcoming shows and his MySpace usage. The conversation shifted to the frustrations with Windows operating systems compared to Macs.  The main guest of this segment was Ian Halpern, author of *Brangelina*.  Halpern discussed his previous book on Michael Jackson and its controversial claims, which he asserted were largely corroborated. He then detailed his new book, focusing on salacious and unconfirmed allegations about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s relationship, including claims about Jolie’s behavior, mental health, and relationship with her brother. Halpern shared anecdotes about his research methods, including going undercover as a mental patient and a paparazzo. He also discussed Tiger Woods’ alleged sex addiction and his encounters with various celebrities, including Jennifer Aniston, John Mayer, and Jill Nicolini, interspersed with sexually explicit comments and crude jokes. He also mentioned unconfirmed allegations about John Travolta. Opie and Anthony interjected with comments and jokes, occasionally challenging Halpern's claims.


The next segment briefly mentioned Halpern’s book and Suzanne Callahan from the *New York Post*.  The hosts then discussed the Jesse Ventura video, explaining that 20 minutes of footage was missing from the widely circulated version and expressing their company’s lack of understanding for the show's visual element. They touched upon the New Jersey Nets’ losing streak and a humorous YouTube video about a “Remove Your Hat” incident leading to a 75-year prison sentence for the assailant, noting the presence of denture cream on his knuckles. The conversation shifted to a picture of a dead cop killer, with the hosts commenting on the obscuring of the body's genitals.  They also discussed Meredith Baxter’s announcement of being gay and the difficulties of the fight for gay marriage in the United States.  A heated audio exchange between Ventura and Jim Norton about the war and other topics was then played, followed by Ventura’s departure and Norton's sarcastic remark about Ventura's hair. Richard Huff’s *Daily News* article covering the event was criticized. The hosts further discussed Ventura's departure and the audio of their argument, focusing on Ventura’s belief that he was unfairly silenced and interrupted, and a discussion of immigration checkpoints and the constitutionality of questioning citizens within the US.  The segment concluded with Jim Brewer detailing a bizarre ongoing feud with his neighbor, whom he referred to as "Pizza Man," describing escalating events, including unusual requests, threats, accusations, a family confrontation, and police involvement.


Jim Brewer continued recounting his feud with his “bag of rocks” neighbor, the “pizza man.”  The conflict, beginning with minor disputes, escalated to involve police, federal agents, allegations of mail tampering, threats, and the neighbor's attempts to create a farm on Brewer’s property.  The neighbor’s erratic behavior included burying horses and harassing Brewer and his family. Brewer described receiving a threatening letter from the neighbor's lawyer, and his own lawyer's threatening response was read on air.  Multiple police visits were mentioned, along with the neighbor’s wife leaving him. Brewer expressed feeling vindicated due to the entire community’s negative experiences with the neighbor. The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton’s experience introducing Ozzy Osbourne at a concert, leading to a discussion of other celebrity encounters and awkward interactions with musicians. The hosts and Brewer discussed Sharon Osbourne's harsh, offensive comments about Susan Boyle's appearance.  The conversation finally returned to Tiger Woods’ marital issues and the unfolding scandal, with offensive language and crude jokes throughout the segment.


Another segment featured Jim Brewer as a guest, focusing on the infidelity of famous men (Tiger Woods, Eliot Spitzer, David Duchovny, Michael Douglas, Frank Gifford) and their wives’ surprising tendency to remain with them.  The hosts and Brewer discussed the dynamics of power and status in these relationships.  A significant portion detailed Brewer’s experience working with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro on Saturday Night Live, describing a stressful and humorous rehearsal, a stand-in mix-up, and a chaotic encounter with both actors. The story included details of Pesci's intimidating demeanor and De Niro's late, seemingly intoxicated arrival. Brewer also recounted a comical story about giving Pesci an expensive cigar gift that went awry. The hosts briefly discussed Michael Jordan's $168 million divorce before promoting Brewer’s upcoming comedy shows and a future appearance on Joy Behar's show. The segment concluded with a discussion of the upcoming “homeless shopping spree,” including humorous exchanges about its logistics.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, deviant.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horse shit.  This show is never short of character.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  That's how we start.  We got a real busy effing day, man.  We got Bill Burr calling in.  We got Ian Halpern coming in today to talk about Brad and Angelina.  Oh, what's happening with them?  Our book.  Our tell-all book.  And he's a character.  Is there a big thing?  Is there a lot to tell with them?  You better tell us something today. 
[00:01:30]  And then we got Jim Brewer stopping by.  I guess he has a problem with his neighbor.  And he wants to yell and scream about his neighbor today.  Later on.  And he's got, I think, police records.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  He was hot under the collar.  He said, I need to come on the show and yell and scream about my neighbor.  I'm like, all right.  Come on in, man.  It got that intense where they're screaming.  Yeah, there's.  And police.  Oh, yeah.  Police are involved.  Eh, you don't want to.  Lawyers are involved.  But he refused.  Well, that always makes the situation much better.  But he refused to tell me what it was. 
[00:02:00]  I'm sure it's something so stupid.  It's got to be.  That's why he's so enraged.  So we'll have him on later today.  And Jimmy walked into the ecstasy of gold music today.  It was perfect.  Heroic.  Because he's everybody's hero today.  He's heroic.  He's heroic.  I feel embarrassed.  Why do you feel embarrassed?  The Jesse Ventura confrontation video is literally, and I mean literally everywhere today.  It lives.  It is everywhere.  Yeah, I got a few texts from people I haven't heard for a while. 
[00:02:30]  Just a couple, hey?  The best is reading the comments on the video because you got wrestling fans commenting,  hardcore political guys commenting, Opie and Anthony fans commenting.  Then, of course, the Howard Stern fans have to comment on how much we suck.  It just runs the gamut of idiots.  Did you see some of the comments from the Huffington Post?  No.  No.  No.  No, they're just like, because obviously it's like, well-known comedian Jim Norton, who? 
[00:03:00]  And I was just like, oh, the Huffington Post would say that.  Someone would say that.  What I love about that, you can't say who anymore.  Jimmy's on Leno every other week.  That's why it was ludicrous.  With the lady who the site was named after.  Yeah.  You sat right next to her.  That's right.  That's right.  Those silly geese.  As part of the panel, you actually did two of them with her, right?  What a dummy whoever posted that one. 
[00:03:30]  They really can't say Jim Norton who anymore.  I mean, obviously in the radio world, you're huge.  In the comedy world, you're huge.  But now with the Leno thing, you're mainstream.  So they can't say that who shit anymore.  Jimmy Norton.  I bow to Jimmy, though, because that was just amazing.  It was amazing radio all the way around.  It was a great two hours with Jesse Ventura.  We really enjoyed having him on.  Yeah, it was action-packed.  I mean, the guy, he's obviously wrong on a lot of things. 
[00:04:00]  And some people were saying, like, actually, it forced me to get up off my ass and plug in some wires  and actually do a compound show for the first time.  I don't know how long last night.  Because I just wanted, you know, comments from people and shit like that.  And a lot of people were like, you know, you seem to be agreeing with Jesse on a lot of things.  I was like, yeah, I was agreeing with him.  But, you know, and then he'd turn around and say something that is completely off the wall. 
[00:04:30]  That's why I could go out on the street and talk to a homeless guy and agree with him on a point.  And then when he starts eating his own shit, I'm going to, you know, walk away.  Of course, of course.  I won't agree with that.  But that's why it was great radio yesterday.  It went from there was a lot of agreeing to, oh, my God, this guy's insane.  Yeah.  And we were filming most of the Jesse Ventura segment because we know that it gets a little ugly when it comes in here.  And then, like, the point where it should have blown up, it didn't. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Everything kind of calmed down.  Right.  And then we had another probably close to a half hour of just, you know, some good radio.  And next thing you know, it got ugly again.  So nobody was filming.  Yeah.  And Sam happened to, I got a hold of Sam and said, get in here.  He turns the camera on and 20 seconds later, Jesse got up.  We lucked out on that whole thing.  Yeah.  But unfortunately, we don't have the actual lead up to why he walked out, which was on immigration, not the war. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  He was kind of annoyed with me.  You know, and I still like the guy.  I still think he's a fun guest to have on the show.  I mean, I honestly do.  Apparently he is.  He's a fun guest to have on.  But a lot of people are checking us out today.  What we should do as a channel, we should get the segment of the appearance where it got ugly leading up to the walking off.  Right.  So people could really understand what was going on in the studio.  Because the video doesn't really do it justice.  The editing's a little weird because we had to put something up there.  Yeah.  And the only thing I didn't do, I got like hate mail and a lot of praise mail. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't care, though.  People didn't like it.  I understand I pissed off some wrestling fans, some truthers, whatever.  Truthers.  The people that thought it was like a tough guy thing.  It was like people, what people don't see is when we're arguing, he can be a very confrontational guy without even.  Can be?  But you know what I'm saying?  It's like people couldn't see like when he was pushing the microphone away and sitting there kind of quietly.  Like when we were disagreeing with him and then I made a point to him that was kind of, I thought, rational.  And just defending why I would be for sending troops into battle. 
[00:06:30]  And he knocked the microphone out of the way and he refused to talk.  And it's like, yeah, a lot of people didn't see.  You couldn't see that part of it.  But but it was so obvious and infuriating to you.  If you're sitting there, you could feel the aggression in the room.  And it was it was he and I going back and forth.  But it wasn't like he was just expressing his views.  And I started yelling at him.  It was it was it was it was a heated, intelligent exchange.  It really was.  And Jesse got frustrated.  Jesse got frustrated, said, I'm out of here. 
[00:07:00]  And when he said, you know, what was his statement?  I got I got fucking place.  They're telling me I got fucking places to go or whatever.  Yeah, I don't want I don't know what the exact quote is.  He had nowhere to go.  He admitted on our show.  He had another two hours.  Dude, he said it like right before that.  I was I thought he had to leave.  So I go, OK, we got to like wrap up, get the plug in for Jesse's show.  He goes, tell you the truth, something canceled.  So I have nowhere to go for the next two hours.  Oh, Harada, right.  So we went another half hour.  Next thing you know, he gets up and then we're like, where are you going?  He's like, I have fucking places to go, asshole or whatever the whatever. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, he pushed the mic with people.  Again, people can only make you see this at the end.  He pushed the mic away.  And he goes.  And so we were in the middle of it kind of arguing and he pushed the mic away.  And he goes, I got places to be, asshole.  I got places to be, asshole.  And we're all looking.  I'm like, you just told us you have nowhere to go.  So you just got frustrated.  And that's how you handled your frustration.  And I called him an asshole.  But then, again, what really set me off, and maybe it was stupid, but when he patted me, 
[00:08:00]  it's almost like when you're arguing, fuck you, fuck you, you suck.  You're going back and forth.  You're kind of tit for tat with people.  And then when somebody touches you, even if it's, it's like, okay, now what do I do?  Do I get to pat him back and get physical?  No.  And I don't think he was being menacing.  I really don't.  Dude, I thought he was going to do something.  At one point, I was like, maybe, but.  Are you kidding me?  Of course he was menacing.  He was.  I didn't.  I just was like, I have to say something.  He was back in the room and just dramatically drank the rest of his water.  That was a little bit.  That was him thinking, wow, I want to hit this guy.  Should I hit this guy? 
[00:08:30]  Maybe I should not hit this guy.  This could be a problem.  But it all went through his mind as he's finishing his water.  And then he walked back in a second time, and that's when we got the close-up of his face.  He was out of his mind.  Yeah, he was pretty liberal.  Why was he so out of his mind?  I don't know.  I think he gets, I don't think he likes me too much.  He and I have argued before, and he's pushed the mic away before.  Or, like, what is it about you that he doesn't like?  Because I'm, I'm, I'm, fuck, Jimmy gets under everyone's skin.  Let's be honest with each other.  Because I'm, oh, you're impish.  I'm the type of, I think, I think what it is, is he hates fighting with such a pixie. 
[00:09:00]  It's just like some guys are good.  We teased Mooney about it, but some guys are really okay with making statements and, and  first things, but they don't like to be called out.  Like, I did Pete Dominick's show yesterday, who I like, POTUS.  He's a liberal lunatic.  And everything I said, he goes, well, wait a minute, wait a minute.  And he would stop and, and want you to explain everything, because he's an argumentative  little prick.  And I say that affectionately.  But I don't mind explaining myself.  You know, I don't mind explaining my view. 
[00:09:30]  I don't get angry if somebody wants me to clarify.  It was, it was just amazing.  Let's go to Tim in Cleveland.  Tim.  Yeah.  Morning, boys.  Hi.  Morning, Tim.  My, uh, my favorite part of that interview yesterday was when, uh, Jimmy was, you know,  I was arguing back and forth, and, uh, he goes, you're getting all worked up because  you used the F word.  Oh.  The F word.  I was dying.  Yeah.  You used the F word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just using the language you used. 
[00:10:00]  Punch it out, boy.  Thank you.  I felt, the only thing I felt bad about after it was that, like, I was, I was very angry  when he left.  That you made fun of his hair?  No.  Because that was the response to him.  I'm joking, man.  No, no.  That was one thing I didn't feel about that.  That's a line for the H's.  If he didn't, I would never have said something that rude if the guy didn't touch me first,  but that was my way of equaling that.  It's like, what am I going to do?  Again, get up and pat the guy back?  That's physically.  I actually got, um, we're going right to the confrontation, because people have, you know,  maybe people haven't heard it.  So Jesse's at the door. 
[00:10:30]  Jimmy turns around.  And, uh, this is the exchange that went on.  I love it.  You want to hurt me?  Go right ahead of it.  Makes you feel any better.  I'm an easy target.  Yeah, you're right.  I talk too much.  I also listen too much.  Oh, that's funny.  I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you.  But I don't like to hurt people's feelings.  Oh, God.  Well, you think what you want about me. 
[00:11:00]  I'm not changing.  I like, I like me.  My wife likes me.  My customers like me.  Because I'm the real article.  What you see is what you get.  Aw.  I've been waiting all night to play that for you today, Jimmy.  There you go.  That's really amazing.  Because it kind of sounded like that to me.  What was your line?  I was only, I felt like, what, are you going to beat me up?  Right.  I don't like.  I don't like.  So John Candy.  I know.  Wow.  You know, listening to that clip. 
[00:11:30]  But it was like, I don't like to be menaced by somebody.  It annoys me.  Oh, God bless you, man.  You know?  It's not a tough guy thing.  I'm not a tough guy.  But a lot of people that are listening to us right now, they've been in a situation where  there are big animals in their face.  And you stood up to the big animal in the end.  It's almost like if you're fighting with somebody, right?  If we're having an argument.  Or me and Danny, guys of equal size, are having an argument.  I don't like when I'm this size and you're this size becomes the X factor.  Like, well, that's the final thing in the bag. 
[00:12:00]  It shouldn't come into the.  You argue with Patrice.  As miserable as he can be and as loud as he can be, you never get that vibe from him.  But I've seen him argue with people.  He's never given that vibe to anybody I've ever seen.  Once again, we want the audio leading up to the actual fight just to do it justice because  it's a little confusing if you watch the video.  What we'll do is we'll play it at the end of our show today, just as we're leaving.  You know what I mean?  Because there's a lot of audio out there, a lot of videos.  But this is our channel.  A lot of people checking us out today. 
[00:12:30]  We can at least show you how it really came about.  Instead of jumping around like the video does.  I've started right at that immigration thing, I believe, would be the spot.  Yes.  I've seen Jesse in a lot of interviews over the years.  I mean, Jesus, the guy's done interviews forever.  And he's never been challenged like that.  Never.  No one's ever really come back at him like that. 
[00:13:00]  And he got up and walked away from the situation.  He's used to, yeah, using that, like, hey, hey, I'm a Navy SEAL.  And, you know, hey, you're a great patriot.  You're a good, you know, all that shit.  And it shuts people up.  And you just kept going at him.  Nipping.  What did I say?  I say you were like a little Yorkshire Terrier going after a fucking Great Dane.  You know how they're just...  On the ankles.  And he left.  Because I think people are intimidated by him. 
[00:13:30]  He gives you that look.  He's a big guy to begin with.  What, is Larry King going to go after him?  I tweeted about that yesterday.  How important is my shattered jaw?  Larry King wouldn't know he's wrong.  Larry King didn't question him on anything.  No.  He didn't challenge him on anything.  And there were people that said, like, uh...  Someone in this own fucking building didn't challenge him on anything.  People were like, you should just let him say what he wants, and that's the...  No.  No.  Ron Bennington's the master of that.  Like, but he does it with a great job with the people from the Westboro Church. 
[00:14:00]  He has that Shirley Roper Phelps on.  But she's...  I think everything she says sounds nuts.  So it's like, to me, that's entertaining to allow someone who says completely wrong shit all  the time to ramble.  He's not like that.  He's not a lunatic.  He doesn't say everything wrong.  Yeah.  He actually says a lot of stuff I agree with.  Yeah.  So it's like, it's not entertaining to me just to let him ramble, because I'll agree with  half of what he says.  Yeah.  And then it sounds like I'm agreeing with the other half.  No.  Jimmy, I got a page of comments about the video. 
[00:14:30]  Are you prepared for this?  Of course.  Okay.  I can't take my eyes off of Fat McLovin having a laugh outside of the studio.  That kid in the background in the Batman hoodie is creeping me out.  McLovin lives.  Question one.  Who is the dummy in the Batman sweatshirt that kept showing his stupid face to the camera?  People don't miss a thing.  Tell Mr. Batman that if he sees Opie videotaping to stop grinning and hide his dumb ass out of  the shot.  Is that McLovin in the background with the Batman shirt?  Is that McLovin in the background at the two minute and 30 second mark? 
[00:15:00]  Tell McLovin to get out of the background.  The kid in the Batman hoodie really bugs me.  Look, it's McLovin in the background.  Wow.  Who's the mongloid tarred in the Batman sweater?  By the way, who's the fat McLovin in the background?  What's with the douche in the Batman hoodie?  I wish Jesse would punch him in his stupid AIDS infested face.  Wow.  And finally, check out McLovin in the Batman hoodie at the start of the video.  That's great.  They really do paw over the videos and look at every aspect of it. 
[00:15:30]  I watched it once.  Look, there it is.  He's just so happy to be there.  Oh, that's so fucking funny.  He was so excited about what was going on.  The kid loves working for the show.  Of course.  Who wouldn't?  He just loves it.  People are saying there was a giant logo missing from the video.  I got that one.  Like, where's the giant logo?  Because there's nothing to do with that shit anymore.  Thank God.  I look a little thinner than I would have hoped. 
[00:16:00]  I'm very happy.  I look thinner than I would have thought I should say.  Oh.  I've lost some weight.  Yeah, the video's everywhere.  This is important.  I think most people that check out our show have seen the video by now.  We don't really need to promote it.  Let me say hi to Greg in Oregon.  Greg, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, my only thing is every time Jesse Ventura is, you guys always refer to it as an interview,  but Jimmy never interviews the guy.  I mean, it's always a debate, which is what I think makes, you know, Ron Bankson so great  is, regardless of his views on anything else, I mean, he brings people in, he interviews 
[00:16:30]  them, and then just kind of lets their insanity speak for itself.  We, and that's, again, with him it's harder because I agree with so much of what he says.  It's two different styles.  I mean, it was great yesterday.  In the end, it was great radio.  That's all we care about, and it did start as an interview, but then when you get into  some, you know, topics, you know, people have opinions and you're going to start debating.  Yeah, it's, to me, when a guy is saying, like, that's our style, you know, very controversial. 
[00:17:00]  Go ahead, buddy.  For me, it was just that, you know, the more, the more insane it kind of got, then, like,  Jimmy would start getting, happy birthday, by the way, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Start getting, you know, kind of wild about it, and to me, it's just like letting that  guy win, you know what I'm saying, by showing him how much you're letting him affect you.  Oh, my God.  Come on, Greg.  I don't buy that.  What were you listening to?  Jesse was pretty much affected by what Jimmy was saying.  We were angry at each other.  Right.  I'm not afraid of somebody making... 
[00:17:30]  Absolutely.  And in the end, he walked out, and he didn't walk out because Jimmy was calling him names  or nothing.  He was challenging him on his points.  And when he said, like, when he said that we were like, ah, you guys don't serve, and then  I explained how I agree with him on pulling the military out of everywhere, I want the  soldier...  Like, when I explained that to him, and it was rational, and I didn't want to come off  that way, and he was still kind of mad he had pushed the microphone away, that's when  I got really angry.  It's like, dude, I just gave you a nice, rational explanation, not a dick thing.  I agree with you on a lot of it.  And he was still kind of pissed off.  So, I'm not that good at that, dude. 
[00:18:00]  I'm too confrontational.  I wish I was better at that.  And once again, that's why, later today, we got to get the audio that led up to the  actual walking off.  So, it's represented, you know, how it was yesterday.  And you know what, buddy?  I do want to hear people express their opinions.  And sometimes, like, I'll throw out, like, little points.  And you'd be surprised how fast people get confrontational with me.  Like, when I started asking him about JFK, I really wasn't going to argue JFK, because  I'm not in a position to argue for the Oswald theory. 
[00:18:30]  I don't, I really, I couldn't argue against the magic bullet.  But I was just kind of saying, like, hey, I'm a guy who was a conspiracy theorist.  And I'm kind of leaning the other way.  And he got very, like, oh, no, what do you mean?  Your government.  Like, Jesus, dude, I'm just.  You know, going back to that, I got to bring this up.  He said, you can't shoot through that tree.  Yeah.  Someone out there would know better than I.  Yeah.  Back in 63, was that tree as tall?  And they trimmed it down over the years, and it grew back.  I mean, how big was the tree in 1963?  Have you seen it? 
[00:19:00]  I have seen the tree.  Well, of course you have.  I went to Dealey Plaza with my brothers about four or five years ago.  Oh, did you?  And I actually sat where Oswald supposedly sat.  And yeah, there is a massive tree in the way now.  Oh, let me just push my mic.  Lean back and laugh at you.  But that tree's been growing for 30 some odd years at the time I went.  Close to 40 years, probably.  So how big was the tree back in 63?  I think it was still a decent size, but I believe the shots were made from it.  And it was like when I was saying, yeah, but there were people, like there was a photographer, 
[00:19:30]  an AP photographer who saw Oswald or somebody in that window.  Yeah.  And then there was people on the floor below him who heard these shell casings hitting.  And I'm saying that, and these are testimony from real people that a lot of the conspiracy  guys have kind of looked over.  And instead of going, oh, all right, well, I'm not sure what that means.  They could hear shell casings falling on the...  Yeah, it's like, dude, how do I have like an intelligent chat with somebody?  I wasn't even being confrontational.  I was just saying like, you know, these are the things that made me question.  I got a neighbor upstairs for me. 
[00:20:00]  It's wood floors.  I hear when the pins drop.  Yeah.  Some kind of pin or something is dropping every day.  Yeah.  And you could tell it's some kind of pin thing.  And here's another thing that never really got hashed out at that moment because it got  so emotional right away with him being, you know, confrontational.  It wasn't like somebody was on the floor below going, I believe I hear shell casings hitting  the floor.  Right.  It was after the fact when they were being questioned and they said, yes, I was.  I did hear a sound like shell casings hitting the floor. 
[00:20:30]  You know, when you're questioned about something like that, it could have been anything at the  time.  Change.  Yeah.  Someone dropping a quarter on the floor or some shit like that.  But when you find out the president was shot from the window above, then you start thinking,  wow, maybe that was shell casings.  Sure.  And they said they heard shots coming from above them.  I mean, you know, it was just like a lot of the stuff like that.  And it was just like, again, I'm not prepared to argue that point completely through, but  it was just a point I was making, like it's kind of made me question, but there's no having  that chat. 
[00:21:00]  No, no.  He just sits back and laughs at you.  But that's, he'll just laugh.  That's one of those arguments though.  There's never going to be a winner unless the government comes out and goes, here you go.  This is what happened.  And then he made the whole thing is, I was telling Jimmy the other day, it's so watered  down at this point because all these theories are thrown in the mix and you don't know what's  real and fake anymore.  Yeah.  But the shot has maybe has not been reenacted from that window, but it's been reenacted  multiple times from other locations with the same, as close to the parameters as they  can make.  And the House Select Committee on Assassinations, which originally said they believe there was 
[00:21:30]  a conspiracy.  Then they requested the audio years later.  They go, that's not, that's not what it was.  Now they don't think it was.  You know what?  I finally believe in that whole thing.  The first shot misses completely.  The second shot hits Kennedy in the back and does all whatever it does as it tears through  him.  And the third shot is that amazing head shot.  You ever see somebody full court just heave a basketball and it goes right in the basket? 
[00:22:00]  Could that have, have you ever just had a lucky shot?  Well, that could have just been like, oh my God, I got one shot left.  I hope I come.  Holy shit.  His head is gone.  Like that might've just been a lucky and everybody pondering over it.  Like, could he get three shots off?  Could he do this?  Could you aim?  Could you?  Maybe that fucker just got a lucky ass third shot and, and that was it.  And there's, and the thing I was trying to, and again, this is not about the whole JFK  thing, but there is a, a weird, like the, the jacket, people said there was a bullet 
[00:22:30]  hole in the jacket and one in the back, a higher, they were at the wrong level.  His jacket was bunched up, uh, because of the type of seat he was sitting on and watch  when he grabbed his throat.  So he also had a weird, uh, uh, uh, uh, not a girdle.  What's another thing?  A corset.  Yeah.  Which he wore because he had a bad back, which is one reason that they think he didn't fall  over.  Fucking Marilyn.  Of course.  Um, yeah.  Ow, my aching back, that bitch.  He had a horrible back.  They think that's one reason he just kind of sat there as opposed to being able to just  lean over.  Yeah, yeah.  Um.  Speaking of Marilyn Monroe, the video, we never got to it, but the video of her smoking pot. 
[00:23:00]  There's no audio though, right?  Nice.  I don't know.  Let me see what this is.  I think it is only video.  We don't have to talk about JFK all day.  Yeah, I mean.  And you know what?  Now that I think about it, we really should play, we should play the audio leaving, uh,  leading, leading up to Ventura leaving.  Yeah.  On our live show.  So we can comment about it.  Yeah.  So if you guys could get it down the hall, that'd be great.  I don't mean to walk on a JFK rant.  I just started reading Boogliosi's book again last night.  Boogliosi.  He's got a name that sounds like that.  I am Boogliosi.  Or his name is Gliosi and he didn't do it well. 
[00:23:30]  Boogliosi.  Here's the Marilyn Monroe pot thing.  I don't know what it is.  Let's see.  A home movie showing a relaxed Marilyn Monroe apparently smoking marijuana has surfaced,  retrieved from an attic some 50 years after it was filmed.  The footage taken at a private home in New Jersey was recently purchased by a collector  for $275,000 from the person who shot it.  That's no surprise.  Everyone smokes pot and fucks.  Yep.  Yeah.  So, no matter what era you lived in. 
[00:24:00]  She looks pretty there, too.  Well, you want props, Jimmy?  I mean, they're all...  I can take them or people who didn't like it.  I don't...  I don't know people who didn't like it either.  Well, let's start with Jesse Ventura.  He wants to apologize to you.  Oh, my God.  Jesse!  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Jesse.  I just wanted to call and apologize for my abrupt departure yesterday and say to Mr. Norton,  I do believe you are an actual patriot, Jimmy. 
[00:24:30]  I just obviously had some disagreements with what you were saying to me yesterday and in  the manner in which you said it to me.  Well, I felt the same way, Governor, and let me apologize as well.  I will say that, you know, I may not be a veteran, but, you know, the only thing I can  say is I did go into a war zone for free to perform for a week.  Yeah.  Again, it's certainly not comparable in any way to service, but, you know, it was all I was  able to do.  Should be said, though.  What is coming into question, though, is his actual service in Vietnam, whether he was 
[00:25:00]  even a SEAL or not.  Well, I think...  Wasn't he something that isn't quite classified as a SEAL?  Like what used to be called a frogman, underwater demolition.  Yeah.  From what I was reading, he was on something called the UDT, which is the underwater demolition  team, and it was a precursor to the SEALs.  Right.  So he wasn't actually a Navy SEAL.  He was what the SEALs were before they were called SEALs.  Really?  No.  There were SEALs back then also.  They combined the two after they stopped the underwater demolitions team in, like, 1983.  Then they combined the two. 
[00:25:30]  He wasn't in the SEALs ever.  It was an underwater demolitions team, and he did his time in the underwater demolitions  team.  And then in 1983, they did away with the underwater demolitions team and combined the two and made  it the Navy SEALs.  So, but there were SEALs, and there were SEALs in Vietnam, and there were underwater demolitions  team that he was part of.  But there's also no real evidence of him in Vietnam. 
[00:26:00]  Apparently, he was in the Philippines.  Did we know this yesterday?  No.  Apparently, he was in the Philippines at this time, playing basketball and hanging out at  a base in the Philippines.  Well, I asked him yesterday.  We didn't get...  He said nothing.  This was brought up at certain points, and his spokesperson has always said, kind of skirted  it, and said, he's done his duty.  This doesn't even merit an answer. 
[00:26:30]  So, you know, I mean, he did his time.  He was in.  It was during Vietnam, the tail end of Vietnam.  But, um, as far as being there and being in some kind of combat, uh, that's up for debate.  Apparently.  Uh, let's say hi to Randy in Missouri.  Randy!  You tuning son of a bitch!  You guys keep saying this was a debate.  Jimmy attacked him from the minute he walked on the air. 
[00:27:00]  Never gave him a chance, and it was never an interview.  Jimmy just started attacking, just like he did the last time he was on.  That's...  Hold on, Randy.  ...who's not scared of him.  That's not...  That's not...  No, but that's not about...  It's not about proving anything.  Dude, when I'm having an argument with somebody, it's not about...  I don't expect when two guys are having a debate on the air for it to be a scared or not scared  thing, any more than I would if it was a woman whose ass I could kick.  Uh, you have to realize, this guy says...  That's what it came off as, though.  Well, Randy, I'm telling you what it was.  I'm the guy.  If it came off like that, you misinterpreted it, because that's not what it was. 
[00:27:30]  I'm explaining to you what it was.  I'm the person.  I'm the guy.  And you're saying it sounded like that.  And I'm going, well, that's not what it was.  He's a guy that, like I said with that JFK thing, he gets very...  When you're sitting next to him, he's much more confrontational than you think, and when  you're heckled as a comic, you kind of read somebody's energy real quick, and it's like  when you're sitting next to somebody, you read their energy as well, and he has a very  dominating energy, and like when you try to be polite and go, well, you know, I don't  know about that.  Oh, yeah, well, you just don't know.  That's the type of guy he is, so the only way to have any type of back and forth is to 
[00:28:00]  be confrontational, or just to agree with him.  He doesn't want to listen to other opinions on stuff.  He was ready to do it the minute he walked on, it was like, he was going to hawk his  stuff, and I was like, you just started attacking him just like you did the first, you know,  the last time you and him got into it, I agreed with, but it seemed like, you know, it made  good radio, and I'll agree with that, but it just seemed like, yeah, I didn't even give  him a chance to get started.  But Randy, don't forget, you're thinking two times ago, because we had an argument when 
[00:28:30]  he was at K-Rock, and then he came on again on this side when we were here at Sirius.  We were surprised that he came back.  And we had a really nice time.  Yeah.  There was no confrontation whatsoever.  So it was like, I was not looking for that, because we had the post-confrontation interview,  and we had a great time with him last time he was here.  Yeah.  So it was not about that.  Jimmy didn't have an agenda when Jesse walked in, Randy.  I could tell you that much.  I was just wondering if Kenny was close enough to pull him off if he'd snap your neck, though.  I was hoping he didn't do it. 
[00:29:00]  I know it had to be in your mind, because he is a big, scary dude, and he was, you know,  a seal or a frog, and, you know, he didn't learn to kill a guy with your thumbnail.  Dude, he could punch me through the wall.  It's not, I had no agenda with the guy.  I honestly, I don't dislike Ventura.  If he was on today, I'd still talk to him.  He probably dislikes me a lot more than I dislike him.  I don't care.  We had an argument.  We had two guys who had an argument.  I hope he comes back someday.  It's very hard to get a word in edgewise with Jesse Ventura.  It really is.  And then when you do, he just blows it off, sits back, laughs at you, asks you questions 
[00:29:30]  that you could turn around and ask him the same thing.  Like, 9-11, well, were you there?  And then you go, no, were you?  Well, I've seen reports.  And then he goes on and talks about that.  You're like, well, wait a minute.  I could do the same criticizing to you.  And it was like, when there was a point where I asked him, we had a nice time where I was  like, what do you think about Afghanistan?  And he goes, well, I don't.  And I'm like, I'm not being sarcastic.  Like, what do you think is the right answer?  I don't know.  And he admitted he didn't know.  You tell me. 
[00:30:00]  It's like, you know what I mean?  It's like, it's hard to have like a moment where you go, look, man, this is, I would  really like to know your opinion.  You know, you have to realize that, that, by the way, we're looking at a picture on Fox.  It's in the post of a fat man on American Airlines.  I'm too fat to fly.  A flight attendant takes the shocking photo.  That's the greatest picture ever.  Ever.  That motherfucker, there's a guy sitting, he can, it's half the seat.  He is in the aisle.  Half his big fat body is in the aisle.  Just fucking everybody's day up.  The fact that they would not call that out, the fact, that's why you have to love Southwest 
[00:30:30]  Airlines.  That guy should be forced to pay for two seats.  Of course he should.  Look at the poor guy next to him.  What, he expects the airline to give him a seat that's big enough for his fat ass?  Everybody next to him.  How about the person that has to get out, like, in the other aisle?  He would barely sit and fit in two seats.  He's actually hanging purposely away.  If you look at the guy next to him.  No, he's, he's shoulder to shoulder with the guy, which means that his entire left cheek  is in the, he's taking up all the seats.  In the aisle.  Why would you, I understand fat people have to fly, but why wouldn't you, if you're that 
[00:31:00]  obese, understand that your addiction is affecting other people and you have to take the hit for  it?  You now have, you need two seats now.  Jesus.  You need two seats.  He's in the aisle.  That has to be, that, that's a safety concern right there, by the way.  If you had a fucking carry-on bag and you put it next to your seat in the aisle, the fucking  flight attendant would say, you can't keep it there, wouldn't they?  But this guy's ham fucking hock leg and giant side of beef shoulder. 
[00:31:30]  This guy is massive.  He looks like he's really tall, too.  Yeah, he's a big motherfucker.  He is a massive gentleman.  Get off the plane!  We got Bill Burr on the hotline.  It's going to be a very busy day.  Hey, Bill, what's up, buddy?  Nothing.  Hey, Bill.  Oh, my God.  We're just, we're doing it.  We're holding down the fort.  What do you want to...  Nothing.  Listen, I'm just laughing because I was on the phone for two seconds and all I hear is  Anthony going, get off the plane!  I get a little angry. 
[00:32:00]  You'll see the picture later today.  There is a guy that a stewardess took a picture of on a flight.  He is massive, Bill.  Yeah.  It's not even close.  And he only fits in half a seat.  The other half of him is in the aisle.  He's in the aisle.  It's taking up half the aisle, his huge fat body.  And it's a safety concern.  Oh, and let me guess, his rights were violated.  I don't know the story yet.  I guess the story after the break.  A flight attendant took the picture. 
[00:32:30]  That's why I am so pro-swine flu.  It's ridiculous.  You're digging the swine flu?  You got to thin the hurt every once in a while.  It's only going to kill the weak.  It's like a forest fire.  It's a cleansing.  It's a rebirth.  All you got to do, take your vitamins, wear a sweater.  I'm telling you.  Wear a sweater.  Okay, Grandma.  And wash your hands every once in a while.  That's it.  You're going to be fine.  But guys like that, they're all going to drop, and it needs to happen.  Yeah.  We need a little more room.  A little more room. 
[00:33:00]  We're the only species where the dumb can survive.  Yeah, dumb squirrels don't survive.  No.  There's no dumb lions.  There's no...  You die.  If there's a dumb squirrel out there, and he can't get his nuts collected for the winter,  what happens to him?  He dies.  Right.  He doesn't have other squirrels collecting the acorns for him.  Yeah.  I was actually...  I had this argument the other night at a party out in Los Angeles, and people were trying  to claim...  Oh.  That's like the dangerously close to the same attitudes people had with homosexuals and 
[00:33:30]  AIDS.  I'm like, no, it isn't.  I'm talking about dumb people.  I'm not talking about a specific, you know, I don't know, a race or a sexual preference.  In general, a nice little spring cleaning.  Dumb is all-inclusive, by the way.  That is probably the most inclusive, diverse category on the planet, is dumb.  Exactly.  I have not come across... 
[00:34:00]  Nobody thinks that they're part of the dumb group, which is going to be even funnier when  they get the swine fluke.  Wait a minute.  I was part of the problem?  Yes.  That's right.  You're it.  They have decided you're part of the problem.  Hey, Bill, what do you got on Tiger Woods?  I'm sure you've been following this one.  Um, I just think it's such a non-fucking story.  I can't even believe, like, who gives a shit?  Like, the guy was famous at 18. 
[00:34:30]  He's got millions of dollars.  He's got some of the hottest women in the world throwing themselves at him.  It's like, who really, honestly, has, first of all, has ever been tested like that?  And who could stand up against that?  I mean, you've got a bunch of fucking, just losers, who are just jealous that this guy  makes a ton of fucking money.  And now he, you know, whatever.  He fucked around on his wife.  I disagree, Bill.  He owes me an explanation.  As a golf fan, I need to know.  He's a hero. 
[00:35:00]  I agree.  You see that pussy on Entertainment Tonight?  Oh, what an asshole.  Or, uh, what was he on?  The Insider, right.  The Insider, whoever.  It was the Insider.  You're right, Jimmy.  He's a role model.  What am I going to tell my children?  Tell him to grow up and be hot and fuck Tiger and get some money out of it.  It is a great story, because you really thought he was a goody-two-shoes type of guy.  Did you?  Yeah, he kind of did, actually, on this one.  He was pretty scandal-free.  He was pretty scandal-free for a while, but, you know. 
[00:35:30]  So what?  He likes pussy.  Wow.  Come on, all those sports anchors guys, all those guys, everybody.  I mean, the amount of guys, you can't handle it.  You can't handle it.  A pair of tits, and a tight ass comes up to you, and we fail every time.  It's up to three girls.  The original one, that Rachel girl, I can't really, I forget her last name, who lawyered  up with Gloria there, the red pantsuit fucking lawyer. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Uh, she's having a press conference this morning to officially announce that, yes, she did  indeed have an affair with Tiger Woods, even though she denied it at first.  What's the matter?  Is she mad that she's not getting any attention to someone else?  I think that, when that other whore came out of the, out of the woodwork, she went, fuck,  you just blew my spot, fuck that.  I'm doing my own press conference.  And that's why, you're supposed to get hookers.  I am a figure.  Yeah, well, I was, we were talking about that yesterday, and apparently, uh, Elliot Spitzer 
[00:36:30]  kind of fucked that whole thing up, because you look at that and go, well, he got hookers,  and look what happened there.  Uh, what happened to the old school broad, it would just keep her mouth shut.  Yep.  That's what you need.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  Unless she, you know, she doesn't, if she doesn't have a Rita Hayworth hairdo, just go  rub one out.  Rita Hayworth.  Jesus.  Jesus.  She keeps her yap shut.  Yeah.  Wow.  Um, no, actually, you know, the reality, I really feel bad for that guy. 
[00:37:00]  For Tiger?  Do you really?  Yeah.  I feel bad for him, because, you know, I've, I've messed up.  Everybody's messed up, but I don't have to go on TV and fucking apologize for it, you  know?  Yeah.  I really don't, I really don't think it's any of my business, and one thing that I love,  I love that the guy lives in a gated community, and still somehow the paparazzi got snapshots  of his mashed up truck.  That means some cop sold it to the paparazzi.  Now, doesn't anybody get busted for that shit?  I agree.  Everybody just, everybody just goes out and makes their, you know, their little fucking 
[00:37:30]  five, six hundred bucks here, five, six hundred bucks there.  Yeah, everybody wants a little attention, you know?  And us being curious, like, you know, as comics or as a, as a, as a, as a radio show  that is not supposed to be a news show, even the insider, it's like, that's one thing,  but the way the mainstream media, like, it's on the front page of the Daily News and the  Post, and when you see what they don't cover, it's like, they're just all fucking despicable.  Describe the, the picture on the cover of, uh, that paper right in front of you there,  Jim.  It's actually a funny picture of her, of his really hot wife and, and him, and they've  superimposed a golf club and a hand like she's holding a club, and they've, like, with 
[00:38:00]  him, they've knocked out a couple teeth and put band-aids on his head, and it said,  Tiger admits, I'm a cheetah.  This is kind of amusing.  But it's the newspaper.  That's stuff you used to do in, like, sixth grade.  Yeah, that is funny.  It's like the newspaper, yet they, they're photoshopping Tiger all beat up.  Right, and who didn't, uh, who didn't, uh, who doesn't like them in the Post?  Andrea Peiser and Phil Mushnick.  Ugh, Mushnick.  What would you expect?  The two we hate the most.  But are they ever, are they ever not predictable? 
[00:38:30]  Can we find out what Andrea Peiser said about this?  One of the biggest things I miss in New York is that ray of sunshine, Phil Mushnick.  Yeah.  That last name just sounds like he never was in a good movie.  Yeah, for the rest of the country, Phil Mushnick is a sports columnist, and he hates sports,  so I don't know why he writes about it anymore.  Yeah, he's a nice thing.  I don't know the last time he actually had something positive to say about sports in general.  He hates everything.  He hates everything.  That's his thing.  He's like the curmudgeon.  But you can't be a columnist and hate everything. 
[00:39:00]  He's a bore in a mainstream paper.  Maybe on your dumb blog, IHatesports.com or something, but not in a mainstream paper.  I just love that Tiger's wife chased him out of the golf club.  You know if he just has them all over the place, he has so much free shit.  Dude.  Oh, yeah.  What came out now is the route or the route of the car, and it's so obvious to me that  she was chasing him down the fucking road.  That's why he was hitting everything. 
[00:39:30]  He hit a curb.  I think he hit another curb.  He went over a hydrant and then hit someone's tree two or three houses down.  Was she chasing him in the golf cart?  I don't know, man.  Because there's a story that the golf cart was there, and I've seen a picture of a golf  cart near the wreck.  And the thought of him driving an Escalade, her with a golf cart.  Swinging as she goes?  Yes, swinging with a fucking golf club.  That's basically, it's like every horror movie from the early 80s, where you'd somehow get 
[00:40:00]  out of a house, and you're trying to start the cars, the psychos coming out, and you'd  be going, go, go, go, and somehow they'd hit a tree, and you're like, oh, you fucking  idiot.  You almost were out, you dummy.  And it makes it more suspicious, because I forgot to mention this, when this Rachel girl  has her press conference later this morning, the first mistress that lured up, she says,  it's already out there, that she was texting Tiger about an hour before the car crash, and  she's saying that the wife caught her texting Tiger. 
[00:40:30]  The wife caught her.  Just before Tiger, with no shoes, got in his Escalade, so come on.  Shoes.  When you go in the shower, you turn your cell phone off.  Ah, you got to take it with you.  She's taking it with you into the bathroom.  Bill, what else is going on with you, man?  I left my shoes in my golf clubs.  That son of a bitch, what the fuck is his name, Phil McConkie?  What the hell is that fat guy's name out in Long Island that listens to your show? 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  Somebody from Munak, Pat.  Oh, Pat from Munak.  Pat from Munak.  Jesus, you really messed that one up.  Yeah, Pat from Munaki.  That fucking guy guilted me out of giving away that ACDC box set.  Now I'm doing Christmas shopping.  That's like 200 bucks.  That thing that turns into an amp.  Yeah.  Yeah, we all got the cool ACDC box set, and Bill gave his to pack because he felt guilty.  Aw, what did you do?  I was, aw, what are you doing? 
[00:41:30]  I was literally thinking like, I'm like, ah, what the fuck?  I'm doing all right.  I thought the thing was like 80 bucks or something.  So now I'm trying to order one, and because my address is out in Los Angeles, I don't  have an apartment number.  It's and a half.  Oh, no.  I live on like nine and a half, whatever street.  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  So it's not registering.  What do you have?  The three's company?  You're in the three's company apartment.  Oh, man. 
[00:42:00]  What was he like?  Oh, hey, thanks a lot, Bill.  Oh, that's nice of you.  Thanks.  He's probably living in it now.  Yeah, of course.  He says, I'm reading it, dude.  He goes, sounds great.  Yeah, he's loving it, Bill.  Bill, it just sucks to be a nice guy sometimes.  Ah, I know.  See, that's what I get for being a nice guy.  It seems easy just to be an asshole all the time.  Bill, it's like my CD.  You get to keep your stuff.  It's like learning my CD, Nice Guys Finish Last.  Oh, well.  That's my new CD where I just beat everybody up so I can finish first. 
[00:42:30]  I just realized I'm supposed to be hyping my gig out here in Cleveland, Ohio at Hilarities  starting tonight through Saturday.  You're at Hilarities?  I see that.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Hilarities in Cleveland, Ohio.  Oh, my God.  People should definitely see Bill Burr.  I didn't know he was going to be in Cleveland.  Another phenomenal name for a comedy club.  Yep.  As always.  I'm at Wackos.  Wackos. 
[00:43:00]  And then the following week, it's the Punchline in Sacramento.  That is it.  Well, let's pump up the Hilarities gig in Cleveland, Ohio.  Bill Burr tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  That is what I'm trying to do.  Another thing about that ACDC thing is you can't buy it in stores, and you can only buy  it off of one website, and it will not recognize my address.  And the amount of times that I have cursed fucking Phil McConkie out there in Long Island  is...  Phil McConkie.  He's in Munaki, New Jersey. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, I thought it was Long Island.  I don't fucking know.  Phil McConkie from Long Island.  I love it.  Message board name.  Yeah, that's going to be a new board name.  New message board name.  Jesus, Bill.  Phil McConkie.  All right.  I think we're heading toward our first break, so...  Okay.  Well, I miss you guys.  Yeah, come on back and see us.  I want to take you to...  The only thing that I have regretted about going out to LA, everything else has been great, 
[00:44:00]  but not doing your show is the only thing that has sucked.  You know?  I actually had a nice smile across my face as listening to Anthony going, get off the plane!  Yeah, you feel like you're at home, right?  Getting all angry.  Well, call us, Billy.  Phenomenal.  You're one of the few guys that could do a good phoner, so you should call more often.  I know, but you guys are always in the middle of something.  Who cares?  I always feel like you're going to interrupt.  You know, if you're talking about some fat bastard on the plane, you know, I don't want to interrupt that.  Why?  You could add to that very easily.  I mean, I'm sure you've got a lot of material about fat guys. 
[00:44:30]  No, I actually YouTube, you guys.  I listen to shows.  It's whatever.  People put your greatest stuff up on YouTube and shit.  Then we look fantastic, because it's only the great stuff that we do.  Well, that's how everybody does it.  Of course.  Zeppelin only put out their great stuff.  Yes.  I'm sure they had some clunkers.  Bunch of shite.  When they were fooling around trying to find that gold.  Yeah, I listen to the highlights.  Hey, Bill, you see...  Look at my coat. 
[00:45:00]  Did you see that NHL highlight with, what's his name, hitting his own goalie?  Oh, I know.  You know what I couldn't understand is the amount of people who were going.  And then he whacks his stick again, and he skates away.  I mean, I don't understand.  Because he didn't realize he did it.  Yeah, he didn't realize he smacked his goalie's ear off.  Because hockey fans know, I have seen that a million times.  You know, someone gets frustrated, and they take their stick, and they slam it down on the goal post.  Yeah.  He just, he should have come across over, like, the crossbar. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  It's fucking hilarious, though.  I like how the guy went down like he got shot.  He really did.  But he did.  He didn't want to play that night.  You know, he's like, ah!  Yeah.  Ah, my ear!  That was some, that was bloody, though, man.  That's one of the better freaking highlights in many years.  Yeah.  You know who I like?  I like how Ovechkin is still kind of, even though he's a goal scorer, he's still kind  of, you know, he likes the physical contact.  I don't understand, like, that knee-on-knee hit. 
[00:46:00]  Why, like, because I know he didn't do it on purpose, but, like, why did dirty players,  why would you go for a knee-on-knee hit where you could obviously blow your own knee out?  Yeah, of course.  Is it because you're ready for it?  They've got to keep the fighting in the game.  They're trying to, just stop.  Let these guys fight.  It's great.  I go to a lot of hockey games, and when they start fighting, the little kids jump up.  They're so into it.  Was the goalie Marvin Nash? 
[00:46:30]  They're saying he was named Marvin Nash?  I'm tapping to a pole!  They took my fucking ear!  Marvin Nash!  You know what, hey, Jimmy, I got, both today and tomorrow, I have to do the local TV station.  Oh!  Is there anything worse than that?  It sells no tickets.  And it also means you, you have, yeah, you're talking to soccer moms at, like, 10 in the  morning for five minutes. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  It's so horrible, dude.  But, you know, you got to do it.  But I've done, I've done local TV.  I've never had anyone say, hey, I saw you on News 3.  You were terrific.  Why do you have to do it, then, if it gets you nothing?  I don't know.  I have no idea, and there's always something.  You know what I love?  Whenever you go to those morning, like, news shows, there's always this sexual tension in  the air that at least three people are somehow fucking around with each other.  Ha, ha, ha, shit!  Ah, that is the truth.  You're absolutely right. 
[00:47:30]  But they probably are, holy shit, who is this girl?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Sorry, Bill.  There's a very chesty girl on TV.  On Channel 11, who is really cute.  What the hell?  And look at the tits and what the fuck is going on with the news.  It's porno.  The news is porno.  They're competing with the internet.  That's how they should do the Tiger Woods show.  They should show, like, 12 pictures of women that high. 
[00:48:00]  Oh.  And then just be like, this is what happens to Tiger on every hole as he's shooting.  Yeah, exactly.  She's part of the Jets flight crew.  The Jets 2010 calendar is out, and this is one of the bruds.  Danny, find out which one she is, and I want pictures, pictures, pictures.  Part of the Jets flight crew.  Can I ask your Jets fans how their star-is-born quarterback is doing?  I'll tell you.  Here's the latest, Bill.  They brought in Joe Girardi two days ago. 
[00:48:30]  This was a huge story in New York.  To teach him how to slide.  Yeah, he needs to know how to slide so he doesn't get hurt.  As a Jet fan, I'm embarrassed that our star quarterback needed lessons on how to slide.  And Joe Girardi...  I love the New York Post, dude.  Your guy wins his first game.  He beats the Texans, and they're like, a star is born.  Yeah, one game.  There you go.  He beat the Texans.  You know what?  Sanchez is going to be just fine in the end.  You know that.  But, I mean, to teach him how to slide... 
[00:49:00]  Joe Girardi came to the stadium with 12 or...  Between 12 and 15 different slides to teach Mark Sanchez, and they had a press conference about it.  Did they teach him to head first, like...  The P-Ros?  With the fucking arms out in front.  The one that'll just bust his arms up.  How embarrassing was that?  Was the rest of the team practicing, like, 10 feet away?  Yeah, there you go.  Just laughing at him.  Well, that website picture does it.  No justice. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  So, that's...  Mark Slott.  Yeah, I think he's going to be...  Eventually, he's going to grow into the game.  I just love how...  I just find New York sports writers to be unbelievably lazy.  So, they build shit up to this unbelievable level of hype.  Yeah.  So, then the next article writes itself, where you can just be like, what happened?  Yeah.  You know what?  I mean, the Jets are moving in the right direction.  That's the best I could say about that.  I'm excited.  So...  Are you buying Rex Ryan?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, mother of fuck. 
[00:50:00]  There's too many things happening now.  Now, we're looking at this flight girl.  She apparently did a Maxim spread.  Who's that?  Linda.  That chick that was just on.  That's the same girl?  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we get her on?  Damn.  Why don't we get...  Why don't we get part of the Jets flight crew in here?  She could say everything Jesse said, and we'd be like, yeah!  I'd call myself a gatekeeper.  Good point, lady.  Look at her.  She's doing a split there.  Well, yeah.  Girls know how to split. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, God.  I would lick the parquet floor there.  Hey, maybe they'll have some of that out here in Cleveland on those...  The morning shows.  Maybe I'll get a couple of...  You never know.  Nah, you're going to get some...  A couple of news whores there, Anthony.  Like you say.  Hey, hey.  Pretty good.  You'll be sitting next to some pig.  All right, Bill.  We really do have to take a break.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday, Hilarity's in Cleveland, Ohio.  Our good friend, Bill Burr.  Tickets call 216-241-7425.  Or you got all that info on BillBurr.com? 
[00:51:00]  Yes, I do.  And I am still on MySpace.  I'm the only person left there.  I'm holding down the floor.  I heard of this MySpace once.  MySpace, just like downtown Cleveland.  That's about...  It's just abandoned, yeah.  Seven people left.  Hanging out with a bunch of zombies on MySpace.  It is just your space now, which is interesting.  It is MySpace.  MySpace.  Yeah, the whole thing.  Fuck, we got to move right into Ian Halpern.  He's here already. 
[00:51:30]  Holy shit.  Bill, we really got to go.  We're so busy today.  Okay.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys.  Take it easy, Jimmy.  Bye, buddy.  Take it easy, Bill.  All right.  Good gig.  Call us soon, Bill.  Bill Burr.  The great Bill Burr.  Quick break.  We'll get Ian Halpern in here.  And we're going to play the audio that led up to Jesse walking out, just so it's represented  properly on our own show today.  And Jim Brewer stopping by.  It's just too much today.  More Tiger Wood updates.  Just stay there.  God.  Obi and Anthony. 
[00:52:00]  What's up?  I hate Windows.  Terrible.  I just despise anything running Windows.  It's a piece of shit.  Yep.  Now when I type on it, I got this.  The good thing about, like, netbooks these days, you see these little netbooks now.  They're just very little computers that are just used for simple shit.  Online stuff on the net, hence netbook. 
[00:52:30]  Well, my last one just took a crap.  It won't boot, so I just threw it in my bag.  It's like spare tire.  You just pull out another one.  And this one is a newer one with Windows 7 on it.  Ooh, Windows 7.  Apparently, when I type on it, it crashes the program.  I can't type on it.  You're not supposed to be able to.  Oh, is that one of the features?  All copy-paste.  Of Windows 7 that you're not supposed to be able to type on it?  Get a MacBook Pro 13-inch, a small one. 
[00:53:00]  It doesn't run PT.  Well, then PalTalk stinks.  Tell them to stop not working on Macs, which everyone's getting.  And I know it does run it, but it doesn't run it the way it's supposed to, although this isn't either.  But, you know, yeah.  Hey, PalTalk, douchebags.  We've had a relationship for how fucking long?  Mac!  That's why I'm not on PalTalk anymore.  I be promoted all the time.  We have to get our...  We have our guests.  Yeah, we're going to get them in in a second here, so...  Just sucks an ass, though.  Again, Vista, and then Windows 7, and they try to come out and make it sound great. 
[00:53:30]  You ever sit there and watch an operating system from Windows boot up?  How fucking long it takes?  Or shut down?  My goddamn MacBook, I turn that thing on, bitch is rolling in seconds.  Daniel?  I'm here on our website, and they're bragging about how Windows 7 boasts a sub-30-second boot time.  Like, that's something to be proud of.  My XP can do that.  Yeah, yeah.  So why are we now...  So now we're saying, oh, so now we've gotten the speed back to where it was for XP, and everybody's supposed to be happy about that. 
[00:54:00]  And that was, you know, after the Vista disaster, and then now Windows 7.  Why can't they just figure out how Mac does it?  How is Mac able to start up and shut down that quickly?  You ever sit there in front of a Windows computer after you hit shut down and just watch it shutting down?  Just shut up!  Just pull the goddamn plug up!  Just shut the fuck down!  Or start the fuck up! 
[00:54:30]  You're the whopper.  All right, we've got to get Ian Halpern in.  Yes.  He's got a new book out called Brangelina.  Brangelina.  We had a great time with him last time he was in when he was promoting his Michael Jackson book.  He was a lunatic last time he was in here.  And he looks like a lunatic today.  Hi, Ian.  You're very flashy, Ian.  Hello.  Where does one buy a jacket like that, Ian?  That's cool.  That looks like polished aircraft aluminum.  Look at you, baby.  It does, you know, like propellers. 
[00:55:00]  Looks like they have that same pattern on them.  Looks like that Michael Jackson book did well for you.  That's pretty good.  You've upgraded your wardrobe there, my friend.  Over one million copies sold.  It's all because of this show, really.  Oh, well, we know that.  No, really, I want to thank you guys from the bottom of my mind.  I love Michael Jackson.  I love this guy, man.  Jimmy Norton.  No, really.  You like Jimmy Norton?  I've been telling everyone.  I was telling people in Norway, this is the only motherfucker I've met in radio who,  whoa, I say, this guy knows his shit inside out.  And I love the fact yesterday about Ventura.  If I was here with Ventura, I would have slammed him right over this table. 
[00:55:30]  I have shit on Jesse Ventura that would make your penises go through the ceiling.  Really?  I'm not kidding you.  Because I used to cover the wrestling scene.  Yeah?  And these guys used to have hoes waiting for them right outside the arena.  And I don't care, governor or whatever he calls himself, but I got to take my hat off  to this guy for body slamming Ventura yesterday because, really, that guy's gone in a way  with being the biggest dope in America. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I don't remember him being such an ass during his governorship, though.  I don't remember him being such a, like, he didn't deliver speeches and just start talking  about the towers.  Thermite paint.  Thermite paint.  And stuff like that.  He seemed to be a governor.  He governed.  And then, you know, he does these interviews now and you're like, this guy's a lunatic.  I've got to tell you something.  Yes, sir.  I was in Norway.  I haven't been to my house since this show.  Maybe two nights.  I've been on the road.  Look, I just put out another one. 
[00:56:30]  I've been holed up in hotels, but I was in Norway and I was doing a signing and some  hot chick comes up to me and says, hey, I saw that YouTube video with Opie and Anthony.  He said, that was good radio.  Look, I said, those guys, man, they made the book.  I mean, that video is gone all up.  No, really, really.  I thank you guys.  All right.  And I work hard on my shit.  You know, people are attacking me.  But hey, if they could do better than me, I'll bow down to them.  And I'll tell you guys one thing.  I started working on this book before I started working on Jackson. 
[00:57:00]  I met Mr. Pitt on the red carpet at Ocean's 12.  And if you could find one motherfucking error in this book, I will sleep naked in this studio  for a month.  Oh, we can't wait.  No, really.  God, please find something wrong.  I hope it was something small like he says Tuesday, but it was really a Wednesday.  But before we get into the Brangelina book, let's go back to the Michael Jackson book.  Because when you came in here, people were like, this guy's out of his fucking mind.  But it turned out most of the stuff you said in the book turned out to be true. 
[00:57:30]  Look, I am a bit out of my mind for doing this shit because people want to kill me.  People want, you know, I need bulletproof vests wherever I go.  Well, you're wearing one of them today.  No, this is a giant condom just in case Angie comes on to me.  You know, I have some good stories about her.  But really, all kidding aside, Jackson, I'm sad that the man's gone.  And, you know, people were telling me when I was working on the book and the film about him,  I was the only journalist going around with this guy.  They were saying, you're nuts. 
[00:58:00]  Jackson's a has-been.  You'll sell two copies.  And, of course, after he dies, everyone comes out of the woodwork, produces books.  Look, the fact of the matter is I was the only guy following Jackson.  And I miss Jackson.  Jackson, I'll say, was the nicest celebrity I have ever met.  And he was humble.  He was genuine.  He was respectful of others.  And I miss him.  And I think it's atrocious what went down.  And, you know, now the Jackson's brothers have this reality show coming out. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, no kidding.  You know, this is...  Yeah, can you believe that?  They weren't going to get a reality show unless their brother dropped dead.  They all suck a dick.  You're topical, though.  I'll say that, though.  Michael, we're after he died in this right now.  Did the Jackson family go after you?  No.  They don't...  You know, that's there to go after.  I think they really...  Some of the family members have told me they actually liked the book because it vindicated  Michael of a lot of the allegations.  And one more thing before we move on to the new book.  Any updates on Michael Jackson that you're willing to tell us today? 
[00:59:00]  Um, well, I do say this.  There haven't been any charges filed yet.  But look at Anna Nicole Smith.  It took a year and a half.  And I admire the investigation LAPD is doing until now because they're not being presumptuous.  And I think at the end of the day, you will see multiple people charged, just like in the Anna Nicole Smith case.  And hopefully, there's going to be justice.  Because no matter what, Conrad Murray, he administered DIPRAVAN in a residential setting. 
[00:59:30]  That's illegal right away.  No matter what, he's got to be charged.  And then there's a slew of other people who've got to face the music as well.  Look, Jackson's irreplaceable.  Well, I'm really saddened by what's gone down.  And the fact that so many of these vultures, when I predicted six months to the day that he'd die,  they should have taken me seriously, not book him 50 shows, and put him in a proper hospital, get him the right help. 
[01:00:00]  It was just a, you know, look, I'm not Nostradamus here.  But two people in Jackson's...  We talked to Nostradamus.  What happened?  But no, really, like, two people, they used me to get the story out.  The things weren't kosher around Michael Jackson.  And that, you know, people were trying to loot him out of his estate.  And that he needed help.  He shouldn't be launching a comeback.  Instead, what do they do?  After my claims come out, make world headlines, they book him 50 shows.  And that was atrocious. 
[01:00:30]  If they would have listened to me, Jackson would be alive today.  Whoa.  Absolutely.  That's a bold statement.  No, really.  Absolutely.  He would have got proper medical attention.  You know, I spent a few weekends ago, the whole weekend with his cook.  I used to date Jackson's cook.  That's how I got...  Thank God you had a cook.  Oh, yeah.  She's hot, by the way, Jackson.  No, really.  It almost sounded like you dated Jackson.  And then you said Jackson's cook.  You know, Jackson, he's not my type.  But his cook, she's hot, man.  She's...  You still dating her? 
[01:01:00]  No, we're very intimate friends.  She's got hot boobs, though.  I'll tell you that.  No implants, nothing.  Oh, nice.  So how many...  I love this guy.  How many pages do you have on Tiger Woods, you jackal?  You know what?  No, seriously.  What do you got on Tiger Woods?  I've got to tell you this.  It's a good question.  That's a great question.  Because we're really good at this.  Someone came to me two years ago.  See, I always have about four or five projects in development.  And usually...  What's a project?  Two...  Like books, movies.  I'm Canadian.  I would love you so much more if you didn't have that Canadian accent. 
[01:01:30]  We remember that Canadian thing.  So, someone came to me two years ago with all this stuff on Woods, tapes, testimony, and  I said, look, I don't think it's going to go anywhere.  Like, hey, you know, sometimes you miss the boat.  I definitely miss the boat on Woods.  And I won't touch it now because as we're being interviewed, there's probably 60 guys  pumping out books about Tiger Woods.  Look, the guy, man, he has a hard on.  Plain and simple.  And he likes to chase a lot of pussy. 
[01:02:00]  He's in the strip clubs a lot.  And he, you know, he needs help.  Like David Duchovny, he's got to check into that same clinic that Duchovny went to.  He's a sex addict.  What's wrong with you?  Let me ask you a question.  That's what Ian Halpern's saying.  No, really.  Which is fine.  I'm just saying.  When Duchovny came out and admitted he's a sex addict, there was no backlash.  We let him go.  Only married guys claim to be sex addicts, by the way.  If you're single, you're just a guy that fucks a lot and has a good time. 
[01:02:30]  When you get caught cheating, then you're a sex addict who needs help.  And I'm a guy who really does need major help.  But I'm single, so nobody cares.  It doesn't matter how many fucks you take.  You performed in Montreal, right?  I have, yeah.  Okay.  Now, that's the capital of strip clubs.  Have you been in the strip clubs?  I have not, no.  I went into a booth, like a porn booth, but no, I might have went to one strip club one  time.  Strip clubs for me.  He laughs at strip clubs.  Yeah, it's almost like playing Candyland. 
[01:03:00]  Like, oh, she's naked.  They're a tease.  They're a big tease.  So did you have any prostitutes in Montreal?  I've gotten a couple, yeah.  But it wasn't any different from any other city.  I think it's like 30 bucks for an hour and a half there.  It's so ridiculously cheap.  And they're hot.  Is that Canadian or American?  It's Canadian.  Back when the U.S. dollar, back when there was a better, now it's not as good of an exchange rate.  When there was a better exchange rate, it actually was a lot cheaper to get a hold of.  A hold of it for like, what, eight bucks, I bet you.  Yeah.  It's ridiculously cheap.  And were the chicks hot?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That's it.  Why didn't we know anything about Tiger for the last two years? 
[01:03:30]  I mean, if he's in all these strip clubs and stuff, you would think some pictures  would have, you know, came out or something.  Well, Tiger likes to live a bit under the radar, and he's very guarded, secretive, and people  were afraid to touch him, you know, because he's got a lot of lawyers on his side.  But, you know, a lot's come out.  Look at the house this guy lived in.  I mean, you'd think a guy who's a billionaire would live sequestered from the rest of the  world.  The guy's like living in a housing project, almost.  No, really. 
[01:04:00]  Judging from the 911 call, yes, exactly.  No, the aerial shots.  It's supposed to be a gated community.  Yeah, but there's a lot of houses all around Tiger.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he's got a big, huge house, but then the next big, huge house is right there.  100%.  And if he would have been...  He's making a really good point.  I was shocked by that.  Yeah, if he was living, you know, just incognito in a big estate, this story would have never  broken.  Yeah.  We would have never heard about this.  And how could you cheat on that chick, man?  Well, that's what everybody's saying.  But, you know, something, pump a couple of kids out, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:04:30]  And like you said, he's got a hard-on, he's going out there, there's girls throwing themselves  at him.  He's just a young guy out there having fun.  Bill Maher had the best quote.  He goes, you show me the hottest woman in the world, and I'll show you one guy who's  tired of fucking her.  I think that was Bill Maher's quote.  I'm paraphrasing, but it was a brilliant quote, and true.  It's like, no matter who she is, there's always one guy who has her.  She's a fucking beauty, though, man.  She's a pretty girl, but she's a mother now. 
[01:05:00]  Still a beauty, though.  Have you ever been to Sweden?  No.  See, I was just there.  I was on this show called Scavlin.  And, you know, I refused to go on that show.  What's the show about?  Help us out.  It's the biggest show in Scandinavia.  If you go on that show, you can't walk the streets.  And I'll tell you, I called them two days before the show, and I said, look, I'm just jet-lagged  out of my mind.  I'm not coming.  They said, we've never had one person cancel on the show.  The guest the week before was Jay-Z.  We're putting you on.  Are you fucking out of your mind?  And so I said, okay, maybe I'll come.  So I show up in Sweden, and the next day, literally, I cannot walk the streets. 
[01:05:30]  The whole country, chicks are throwing themselves at me.  Now, the thing with Swedish chicks is this.  I can't blame woods for one thing.  They're hot, but there's just more bark to the bite here.  They're not kinky.  They don't, you know, they're not experimental.  I've been with a couple of Swedish chicks over the years, and they're not really sexually  progressive.  They're just pretty faces who probably have never had to work to turn a guy on.  That's right. 
[01:06:00]  Because of their beauty.  So they, you know, they're probably ABC.  Kiss, fuck, die.  Oh, well, then fuck them.  I agree.  That's a mistake a lot of women make.  They don't do the kink thing.  You got to keep the kink going.  Absolutely.  In a relationship.  It's like Angie Jolie.  She licks the crack.  That's the key.  Wow.  Really?  Oh, that's what keeps the guys there.  So you know that she licks the shit.  That's some of the revelations we're going to read about?  Jesus.  That's what I want to hear, actually.  Have you ever had your crack lick?  The question is, when haven't I?  I love it.  That's the key.  Yeah, it really is.  How do you find that one out? 
[01:06:30]  If you don't lick the crack, the guys are always looking elsewhere because they're not  completely satisfied.  That's why she keeps Brad.  How'd you find that out?  I have good sources on both sides of the camp.  And a lot of his friends are concerned.  And the key is, and you're much better looking than Brad Pitt today, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  100%.  I mean, Pitt should look at you.  Seriously.  You don't want to kiss me.  No, no, no.  I've never kissed a guy.  I don't kiss guys.  By the way, he found that out from Brad Pitt's dentist.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:07:00]  He'd be licking the crack.  I meant Angelina.  What happened?  Oh, Anthony.  Why?  We were having so much fun.  Damn it.  I screwed it up.  It was a nice, funny line that I got backwards.  What's wrong with Brad Pitt these days?  Look at Pitt four years ago.  And look at Pitt today.  A picture's worth, in this case, a million words.  The guy's completely worn out.  He's ragged.  Really?  He's got what?  How many kids is he looking after?  Yes, they have six.  But they're looking after others, too. 
[01:07:30]  Well, now that, yeah, I mean, they're doing a lot for charity.  I do respect them for that.  They seem genuine about their charity work, but she's a loose cannon, man.  And we're going to go all over this, from incest to her turbulent childhood.  Look, Pitt's a good guy.  I actually think he's a talented actor.  You know, all these Hollywood actors, I never watch these films.  I prefer European films where you see real hardcore acting.  But these guys, they're blown up to be stars.  Pitt's actually worked hard. 
[01:08:00]  He goes to acting class regularly.  Doesn't have a big ego.  He's well-liked.  But she...  He was great in Fight Club.  Oh, yeah, man.  A lot of his movies I don't like, but Fight Club, he was amazing.  Amazing.  You don't like Steven Seagal?  Seagal, man.  Look, Seagal was doing a lot of movies.  I was doing some undercover work in Bulgaria a few years ago.  He was the big talk there.  I mean, that's where his career's gone.  Exactly.  Why would Brad Pitt, a guy that could get any woman, right?  Because we were just talking about the Tiger Woods thing.  Why would he settle for Angelina if she's a lunatic?  Man, it's all in the bedroom. 
[01:08:30]  You know, Jolie, she's like the Cirque du Soleil in the bedroom.  No, really.  She's hot, man.  I fucking love you.  No, seriously.  This woman...  She'll do anything.  From the get-go.  First off, they do Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  Jen Aniston actually meets Jolie a short time before the filming starts.  And she says to Jolie, I hope you have a great time filming this movie with my husband.  Let me tell you, they had a good time.  Did he bang her on the set?  Oh, he banged her, man. 
[01:09:00]  In the trailer, on the set, you know, probably on the dolly.  Like, look...  All right, hold on.  Let me slow you down again.  So, what was the problem with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt?  Well, the women out there are like, oh, that's the couple right there.  I'm Team Jen.  The thing is with Aniston...  Did her pussy smell?  No.  That's not.  I've been claiming that for years.  Let me...  This guy knows everything.  Do you know who Aniston's godfather is?  I don't know.  Come on.  I didn't...  David Schwimmer?  See, I'm promoting this guy... 
[01:09:30]  I promote this guy now all over the world.  They said I've never met a guy who knows every fact on everything.  I honestly do not know.  I didn't know...  Okay, let me give you a clue.  She's Greek.  Oh, her godmother.  Her godfather.  Oh, she's...  Is it Aristotle Onestis or...  Telly Savalas.  Wow.  Telly Savalas.  What the fuck?  What happened to the DNA?  I would guess Stavros first.  Wow.  Stavros.  That's some fucked up DNA right there.  That's the godfather, right?  Oh, godfather.  Yeah.  Godfather.  Okay.  Godfather.  Godfather was in the...  Wait, but you could... 
[01:10:00]  What soap opera was he in?  Days of Our Lives?  He had the weird mustache.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think the father was on Days of Our Lives.  That's right.  Jen Aniston's father was an actor.  So, what's wrong with Jennifer Aniston?  She's a cool chick, man.  Or boring in bed.  Yeah.  You know, again, if you don't lick the crack, the guy's always going to look elsewhere.  It's the bottom line.  All your listeners, anyone who's married right now, the women listening to this show, I'm  telling you, go to bed tonight and no matter what, close your eyes, but lick that crack.  You know how they were able to tell?  Your guy won't look elsewhere.  How?  Her dentist. 
[01:10:30]  What did her dentist say?  That her breath stinks.  It's a little too late now.  A little late on her.  That would have been the line of the century, too.  A little late.  And what you said was the polar opposite of what you should have said.  Of course it was.  The wrong person.  I understand.  It was unsalvageable.  I saw.  It was a great joke.  See, I think Ventura was so upset yesterday because he didn't get his crack look the night  before.  That's it.  It had to be.  No, really.  Aniston's cool.  She was a victim here.  Jolie, man, she's not evil.  She's actually done a lot to change her life, but she's manipulative. 
[01:11:00]  And when she hooked up with Pitt, she roped him in.  Pitt, I think, went on Oprah and told the world, I never had sexual relations until my  divorce came through.  That's the biggest load of hogwash.  I interviewed over 60 people on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and they all said from  the get-go it was fireworks and electricity between the two.  And they said it was genuine love from the beginning.  But Jolie has a history of what magicians call, she's a master of this, misdirection. 
[01:11:30]  Every time her image is tarnished, she's able to spin it around and come out smelling like  roses.  For instance, America's housewives, they labeled her a complete homewrecker after she snatched  Pitt from Aniston.  What did she do?  And this is all in the book.  She turns around and starts leaking stories to the media, her and her publicist, Garry  Kaczynski, that Aniston never wanted to have kids with Pitt, and that's why Pitt left Aniston. 
[01:12:00]  Furthest thing from the truth.  Furthest thing.  Aniston had a couple of miscarriages, I say in the book, and she built a nursery because  after Friends ended, she wanted to have at least two kids with Brad.  She was madly in love.  And you've got to take your hat off to Jen, because she never came out and said  negative things about either of the couple.  She handled it in a classy manner.  She did a lot of yoga.  She had a spiritual guru.  And look. 
[01:12:30]  She's got to handle the fucking John Mayer dick.  Yeah, man.  And you know Mayer's got to be packing.  What's with Mayer, dude?  Banging everybody.  Is he banging them all?  I think he's banging men, too.  Don't you think so?  I never got a gay vibe from him, to be honest with you, but if he was and he would do a little  something for me financially, I'm not saying I wouldn't take a little on the back.  I'm just throwing it out there, John.  But is she like, here's the thing with you, they're an interesting couple in the sense  that like, you know, John Boyd's her father, which kind of makes me...  Well, I'm going to get into the father thing. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  You said incest.  Yeah, well, remember that Oscar kiss with James Hayden?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was creepy for everybody.  It was very creepy.  It was open-mouthed.  Now, this wasn't an isolated incident.  She also did this at the Golden Globes, and she did it at several parties.  Now, one thing that's taboo in Hollywood is incest.  She thought it would be cool.  She'd be starting a new trend, and this would be, you know, this would propel her even bigger,  you know, to bigger superstardom. 
[01:13:30]  The furthest thing from the truth, Hollywood moguls, there's two things they frown upon.  If A-listers are gay or incest.  Incest is the worst.  They threatened to blacklist Jolie.  They phoned her managers and said, listen, she'll never work again.  This is the lowest of low.  People just can't accept this in America.  So what does Jolie do?  She's brilliant.  I've got to say this.  She never poses again in public with James Hayden.  All of a sudden, you see this douche come on, Billy Bob Thornton. 
[01:14:00]  She professes her love to him, says they're having a great sex life.  They're wearing each other's blood vials around their necks.  This was all a sham.  This was to misdirect the media's attention.  And as soon as everyone forgot about James Haven, she dumped Billy Bob like a hot potato  and set her sights on three other guys, including Pitt, and all of them were married. 
[01:14:30]  Billy Bob, by the way, was engaged to Laura Dern at that time.  She only goes after men who are attached.  Do you think it's part of the challenge when you're that hot, you can have any guy you want?  So sometimes people like a challenge.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I like the way she licked my crack.  There you go.  That feels good sometimes.  There you go.  So that's not a very flattering light for her.  You're talking about a woman.  I say this in the book. 
[01:15:00]  She once hired a hitman to kill herself.  Now that is pretty outlandish.  How did you get that info and what are some of the details?  I got that from Jolie herself.  She told that to several of her close friends who I had access to.  See, I went undercover a lot in this book.  That's what I specialize in.  How the hell do you go undercover?  What the fuck?  You tone it down a little bit?  I tone it down.  No, really, I get a complete makeover.  First off, I checked myself into the same mental institution she was in. 
[01:15:30]  Did you really do that?  No, really, really.  Oh, that's fucking fantastic.  I said I was suicidal.  I said I might come, you know, I felt like killing people.  And right, I got checked in.  You have to know the key words to get checked in.  It's not easy.  She was in that clinic.  And I met people who treated her and remember her and underwent that whole experience.  It was wild.  And then I went undercover as a paparazzo in France.  Now, this was, I think, my most opportune time. 
[01:16:00]  This was in 2008 when she was giving birth to the twins.  And when everyone at the Chateau Miraval, all the media were there, as soon as she treks  to Nice to give birth, they all run to Nice.  I'm not going to compete with that, man.  I stay behind.  I knew this would be the only time the staff would possibly go out and party.  They had a lot of downtime now.  I befriended that whole staff and got the whole inside story.  Ah, so you go and get the, you know, they're all after them. 
[01:16:30]  You hang back with the crowd and get a little inside info.  Absolutely.  I was the only guy who stayed behind.  From the people who have access to them, which is the staff.  It's amazing.  They talk to you not knowing that you're a journalist.  And it's like, how do you prove, like if they say, I never said that to them.  That's not true.  How do you, how do you prove, like, yes, it is.  You see this thing?  There's these HD cameras now.  Ah, okay.  See, I'm giving up my whole secrets.  Smart.  So I'm like on a cell phone.  But here I am.  I'm filming all you guys.  So I always do that. 
[01:17:00]  Because I love when people come out and deny my shit and take me to task.  And then I start releasing all the videos and make them look foolish.  Smart.  That's why I've lasted so long in this business.  Let's go back to the hitman thing now.  Don't you think Angelina did that just to get her, you know, pump up her publicity?  No.  She really wanted a hitman to kill her.  Yes.  She said she had nothing left to offer the world.  Also, she tried suicide a few times.  Wait, was it the fake suicide, though?  We talk about this on our show a lot.  The fake fucking razor blade suicide.  Well, no, one time, seriously, one time she cut herself so deeply with knives. 
[01:17:30]  She has a big knife collection, Angelina Jolie.  And she was rushed to hospital and they thought she wouldn't pull through.  That was it, huh?  Okay.  But one thing, Angie is so resilient.  When this union is over.  And it's going to be over, you think?  A hundred percent.  I predicted Jackson six months.  Unfortunately, I was right because I love the guy.  In this case, I'm telling you, 12 to 18 months from now, this couple is toast.  There is too much in-house fighting.  They actually don't like each other so much anymore. 
[01:18:00]  And they're not.  But Pitt is worn out.  His friends want, you know, his friends I spoke to want him to run for his life today.  He seems like he cleans up well for movies.  But then when you see him in pictures that the paparazzi get, he's very disheveled, very grubby.  That's right.  That's right.  Stuff.  But, you know, for movies, he seems to clean up.  Yeah.  Well, that's the time he's away from Angie.  So he's able to get his act together.  That's the only time she lets him out of his sight.  When you see him all disheveled, like holding kids that look like, you know, collect them all from around the globe, it just looks a little like, wow, is he pussy whipped? 
[01:18:30]  Is that what it was?  Just completely pussy whipped?  Yeah.  Because it doesn't seem like he really was all in it as far as all the kids go.  You're right.  You're 100% right.  Let me expand on that.  I predict after they split, there's only going to be room in Hollywood for one of them.  Both of them won't, they're not going to stay at the superstar level.  And I think, based on the research I've done, and based on her history, she's so resilient, Angie. 
[01:19:00]  No matter what comes her way, I think it's going to be Angie Jolie staying on top.  There's a family picture.  It looks like they stole the characters from It's a Small World.  It's like they just picked a few as the boat was going around and just threw them all in.  Now, look at that photo.  This is what I mention in the book.  Every time they do this, it's a photo op.  Yes.  And in the background, there's nannies ducking.  They want to make it look as if they're hands-on parents.  The nannies, they're either ducking in the car or ducking in the photo. 
[01:19:30]  When you have nannies calling, the kids calling nannies mommy.  Oh, really?  Oh, that's not a good sign.  I mean, do you guys have kids?  No.  Nobody has kids here?  Nope.  Nope.  Man, I'm the only guy with a kid.  Oh, you got one?  Dude, that's, you know.  I'm sure you're happy with it, but you know.  The kid is my life.  You know, there's nothing better than the boys.  That's why I didn't have one, because it supposedly changes you.  It does.  And I'm not willing to be changed.  I like my selfish, filthy lifestyle, and I know it will change them.  I've said it a thousand times. 
[01:20:00]  It's like when people fall asleep next to that bean pod in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Everyone resists it and goes, oh my God, I don't want a kid.  I don't want a kid.  And then they have one, and it's like, oh, you'd love it.  It's a wonderful thing.  My brother did the same goddamn thing.  He's like, man, fuck a kid.  I'm not going to have a fucking kid.  And then he has a daughter.  It's like, it's just, it's fantastic.  It's great.  What happened?  It's called love.  Fuck love.  I'm looking forward to having a couple kids.  By the way, can I get on to something very important?  I always suspected this. 
[01:20:30]  Yes.  I knew it.  He claims that Billy Bob Thornton has a huge dick.  God damn it.  He looks like he would.  He has to.  When you see him, and again, as Carl in Sling Blade, when his pants are pulled way up,  you see a pretty big mule there.  I never noticed.  I just thought he was a big, skinny, kind of hick-looking guy.  After he kept his dead little brother, poor little fella, he pets him.  Apparently, he's even more well-hung than Errol Flynn.  Wow.  Now, how big would you say there, Ian? 
[01:21:00]  Fourteen.  Whoa.  What the fuck?  That's a fucking thing.  No, really.  When Billy Bob, you know, when Billy Bob's going like this to his leg, it's, you know, it's...  I reckon he's from Arkansas.  Now, I've got to get in a plug here, because my good buddy, Ron Dekelbaum, in Montreal,  he has listened to you guys from the beginning.  Oh.  And this guy cannot believe I'm even in the face of you guys.  You guys are his hero.  He promotes you all over Canada.  And I've just got to give a shout-out to him, because he told me when I come back on this show 
[01:21:30]  to say a big hello to you guys, and you guys are his heroes.  Thank you, Ron.  Thank you, sir.  And we just saw the thing they had, you have a phone or something.  You have more promoting to do, sir.  What the fuck, dude?  You're a crazy man.  You have to give us a lot more time than this.  Does Brad Pitt want these kids?  It only struck me as like a guy, like you're a good-looking guy.  We talked about that.  He wasn't all in on this whole thing.  Do you think he wants no part of these kids?  Are you sick of them?  Pitt didn't know what he was really getting into.  At the beginning, he thought, you know, this was romantic vision. 
[01:22:00]  Sometimes they were spending 18 to 20 hours a day in the sack.  He never had this before.  The kids, look, his heart's in the right place.  Either of them, they're not bad parents.  The thing here is, they're just way over their head.  Joel Lee recently filed an adoption request for a seventh child.  And this is part of the proof why I think they're going to split.  Pitt's name is not on those papers.  It's just Jolie.  And by all accounts, people in the house, I'm the only guy.  I know Joel Lee right now better than Pitt does. 
[01:22:30]  I hope he was the first guy in line at the bookstore to buy this.  Now, she hasn't licked the crack yet.  But, man, I have story after story about her.  And, you know, I tried to make this a very balanced, fair account.  So a lot of the stuff, unless there was extreme cooperation,  I couldn't put in the book because I don't want it to be some hatchet job on her.  Because she has tried to turn herself around.  The stuff she said about Jon Voight, it's ridiculous.  What did she say about it, which I didn't hear?  She said he wasn't there, wasn't a good father. 
[01:23:00]  However, I did my research at the Oscar speech, Golden Globe acceptance.  She thanked Jon Voight, said he was an incredible father, and he was always there.  She fell out with him after because he said publicly,  look, I think she's going back to her old ways and is going to end up in a psychiatric institution again.  I interviewed so many people who grew up with this family.  And painstakingly, I tried to discredit Voight.  I was not able to. 
[01:23:30]  Everyone around that family said Voight put the kids before his career every and each moment.  And I think Jon Voight, I hope he's listening to this today.  I have to defend the guy because...  That would be nice to know he's listening to Jon Voight.  Geez, wow.  Have you ever had Voight on the show?  We'd love to have him on.  You've got to get him here.  You've got to get him here to talk.  He'll do it.  Somebody's got to follow a request to have Jon on this show, and he will talk about it.  This guy was the greatest father you could imagine.  And Angie Jolie, this stems from her days at Beverly Hills High School. 
[01:24:00]  Everyone I interviewed who went to school with her said,  Look, this chick, she could be your best friend one day.  The next day, if she doesn't like you, you're toast.  She'll badmove you, she'll have you, you know, just persona non-grad in the whole school.  And she could flip on you like a diamond.  And that's pretty attrusted.  So is it like her character in Girl Interrupted?  Well, you know what?  Is that an accurate depiction?  Yeah, it's sort of like that, actually.  It's not a bad analogy. 
[01:24:30]  She is a loose can.  What was the other movie?  Gigli or...?  Gia Karangi.  Oh, my God.  Is that a good one?  Yeah.  You would like that one, eh?  And let me tell you something.  She's had so many flops.  If you check out her filmography, she has had one flop after the other.  And I got to admire her.  I respect anyone in media or art who's been in this 10 years plus.  And no matter what comes their way, they just keep going.  You know, we all fall off the bike.  But if you get back on and ride, hey, that's the key.  It is amazing when you think about her. 
[01:25:00]  I can't think of...  She played Daniel Pearl's wife, and I thought she did a good job as Daniel Pearl's wife.  But you can't think of a lot of movies that she did.  Like Meryl Streep, you could fire off fucking Deer Hunter, Kramer vs. Kramer.  With her, it's like, what did she do that you really loved?  She fucked a couple of people that won awards.  It's really hard to picture.  I associate her with famous men.  That's how I think of her.  Is Brad Pitt...  Now, there's always been this talk that he's really kind of a country bumpkin and not... 
[01:25:30]  I don't want to say not smart or anything, but not the brightest guy kind of a thing.  Yeah, well, there's other type of smarts.  You know what I mean?  Not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  No, definitely.  Look, the kid is...  No, really, really.  He is a good kid.  The reason why Brad succeeded...  He's older than you.  Look, there's no...  What are you calling him a kid?  Okay, there's no shortage...  You're right there.  There's no shortage of good-looking people who show up in Hollywood off a Greyhound bus like Brad Pitt, 
[01:26:00]  and you could just yank them and try to make them a superstar.  Brad actually, to his credit, he takes his craft seriously.  He has...  That's the difference.  It's the difference.  It puts him over the top.  He studies film religiously.  He pays tribute to all his predecessors, and he goes to acting class.  And he hasn't burned bridges.  He's a lot like that.  I liked him in California with Duchovny.  I thought he was really good in that.  And George Clooney loves the guy, so... 
[01:26:30]  Apparently.  Yeah, what's with that?  What's up with Clooney?  Yeah, what's up with Clooney?  What's up with Clooney?  What's up with George there, Ian?  Yeah, I don't know about Clooney, man.  Look, I've met Clooney a few times.  One time, the first time I met him was in front of...  Seems like he gets a lot of broads, huh?  It seems...  The first time I saw him, I saw him with a chick around each arm.  I'm not...  In front of the Formosa Cafe in L.A.  He was a chick around each arm, and it seemed...  And they were jamming, man.  It's because he's George Clooney.  He's George Clooney.  For fuck's sake.  Well, what's up with George, right, Ian? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, that's it.  I don't know about George.  I'm reading your eyes, huh?  You got it.  You got it, man.  You got it, man.  I ain't saying shit, and Ian ain't saying shit.  Wow.  But I'm saying, what's up with George, right, Ian?  All right.  I know, man.  See, you're good.  He's looking down now.  You got it.  You got it.  I hope he's going to be Twittering a blind item later.  Yeah, that's it.  Hey, out of everything you said today, the one thing is making people really pissed off.  They're saying, bullshit, Brad Pitt left Jennifer Aniston.  Wait, wait, wait.  Because she didn't want to have kids. 
[01:27:30]  Is somebody saying that?  Yeah.  They're pissed off that you're saying the opposite.  What's the name of that person who's saying that?  Uh-oh.  Bullshit dudes.  Pitt left Aniston because she didn't want kids.  That's K-9 Craig.  All right, K-9.  Let me tell you something.  Right now, right now, K-9, open your eyes, you know, smell the coffee here because the  fact of the matter is you are just being brainwashed by Angelina's propaganda.  It's Angelina who put this out.  There's Jill Nicolini.  You know that chick? 
[01:28:00]  I know her.  I met her on the-  Oh, you did?  I was on the Sally-  Wait, wait.  Jesse Rappel.  Really?  Yeah.  What happened?  Years ago with Nicolini, man.  What do you got on Jill?  And what happened?  Oh, man, I have a lot of stuff on Jill, but I won't say that.  You know, Jill's a smart woman.  She has like a-  Really?  Oh, yeah.  She has like a 4.0 GPO.  Really?  Tell us one thing about Jill.  We don't know much about her.  We've talked to her a couple of times.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But always thought she was pretty hot.  She used to date Garth Snow.  She came up to Montreal to visit me.  Garth Snow?  Yeah, he's the GM of the Islanders.  Oh, right, right.  He was a goalie for the Islanders, too. 
[01:28:30]  Really?  How long did they go out?  I think a couple of years or something.  Really?  She used to be the Islanders girl.  What?  Oh, right, right.  The Ice Girl.  She was the Ice Girl.  See, she's on the weather right now.  We have all these-  Traffic.  Oh, traffic.  Yeah, she's doing traffic.  And she's hot.  She still has her look, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  There she is.  What, um...  Wow, what-  She came up-  Well, I'll tell you one-  Give us a good tidbit about her, because we've been fans for years.  Well, okay, I've got to tell you this.  I hope she's not listening, but-  Probably not.  She's on the air. 
[01:29:00]  Doesn't know much about the show.  Let her rip.  But, you know, one night I did end up in bed with her with my ex, and we had a little-  But I didn't have sex with her.  I didn't have sex with her.  But her and my ex were just going at it all night.  Oh, she loves women, man.  Wow.  She's a great woman, though.  Excellent.  You can't just say that, Ian.  Are you-  No, well, you ask me.  Jill won't deny it.  I hope she's not listening to this, but I love Jill.  I have a couple of pictures up, Danny, because put in, like, Jill Nicolini and see if we  can get a couple of pictures of her up there. 
[01:29:30]  I'm so happy.  Because, uh, maybe-  Pop that one up.  That's a good picture right there.  Oh, holy smokes.  Wow.  Look at that.  Are you serious?  Wow.  Man, you're a lucky guy.  Yes, let's-  Well, he was.  Well, he was.  Does she-  He blew it like everything else in his life.  Bringing another woman into the relationship thing didn't work for me.  Does she like the crack?  Uh, well, yeah, yeah.  Everybody, you know.  See, there you go.  Tit for tat with the crack.  That's great.  She's a good woman. 
[01:30:00]  I met her-  No, really.  I met her.  I was a guest on Sally Jesse Raphael.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, holy.  Whoa.  And you'll notice in every photo that she's happy with him, she's holding alcohol.  Man.  Holy.  I had no idea.  Yeah, that ended when she came into my bedroom one morning after leaving the night before,  and I apparently had a girl in my closet.  Another girl from Canada, by the way. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, there's Canadian girls.  Are Canadian girls hot?  Uh, yeah, I like Canadian girls.  And, um, uh, yeah, she was in the closet, and, uh, uh, Jill opened said closet, and, uh,  then it, uh, turned into a big clothes-burning, uh, ceremony that, uh, Jill did.  She took the, the girls' clothes.  She, she left in my vehicle.  Oh, my gosh.  Came back, uh, and then when I wasn't there, and took this other girl's clothes and put them  in my fire pit in my backyard, lit them on fire, and all that was left were zippers and 
[01:31:00]  underwires.  Well, thank God there was no one there to stop her.  Oh, Keith, yeah, Keith, uh, the cop, taped the whole thing, apparently.  Yeah.  My, my personal security guy.  Thank you very much.  You know who I like?  Wow, this is crazy, man.  Jill's mom is one of the nicest people I've ever met.  Oh, yeah.  She's a very, very nice family.  Yeah, very nice family.  Nice family.  I remember, I met Jill on Sally Jessie Raphael, who I love.  I miss Sally Jessie.  I miss all these people, man.  And, you know, there was so many...  She's not dead, she's off the air, right?  Well, she's been off the air a long time. 
[01:31:30]  A very long time.  I think she has a toy boy in France or something.  I'm not sure about it, but, uh, no, she's a, I love Sally Jessie, and we met, and we became  good friends, and she came up to Canada.  I'll tell you, I wish I could have videoed her jamming with my ex.  That was one of the hottest moments I've ever seen.  I just stood back and watched, you know, and said, whoa, this is so hot.  Damn, Steve, maybe if I would have worked it out a little better than that, but you  would have a nice little thing, man.  You know, Jill doesn't do it for me because of the implants.  I hate chicks with implants. 
[01:32:00]  I'm not into implants, too.  Unless they put it under the muscle.  Me, too.  Put it under the muscle.  Put it under the muscle.  Under the muscle's not as bad.  I hear you, my friend.  You gotta go, so...  Yeah, they're kicking you right out of here.  Well, I love you guys, man, and this is the greatest show, and I want all Canadians to  support these guys, and really, thank you so much.  We've got a nice fan base, you can't.  Congratulations on your pro-Jeks and your amateur Jeks and whatever other Jeks you hold.  Ian.  John Travolta?  Well, man, look, I'm not going to diss him because he lost his kid, and anyone... 
[01:32:30]  No, I'm not talking about the kid thing.  Yeah, but it's sad.  Look, Travolta...  What about that kiss on the plane steps?  Come on.  Okay, that's a good question.  I did the book on Scientology.  That's why I wear this bulletproof stuff.  They want to kill me, man.  I did a film on Scient...  I posed as a gay actor.  They tried to deprogram it.  It's all because of John.  Look, Travolta, that kiss was...  Certainly, he was jamming.  That was with the male nanny.  That's the same nanny who looked after Jet Travolta.  So that guy travels with him.  Yes.  And that was in... 
[01:33:00]  That was shot in Canada when he was filming Hairspray.  That was on the steps of John's private jet.  Look, I love John Travolta.  It's unfortunate that Hollywood's homophobia doesn't let guys like Travolta be themselves.  Travolta...  No, really.  Really.  Well, do you know that I dated Travolta for three months?  I think you and Travolta would make a better couple than you and Jill.  Anthony inspired staying alive. 
[01:33:30]  That's a hell of a statement, though.  No, really.  Let Travolta be himself there, right?  Well, it's not me saying it.  It's other people saying it.  Look, I like the guy.  He's one of the nicest guys you could meet.  But there's no doubt about it.  This is according to Time Magazine.  Not according to me.  There was a Time Magazine cover story back in 1991 saying Travolta's gay.  Yeah.  It's not me saying it.  You know, my opinion doesn't matter here.  I'm just a nobody from Canada.  But I go what the experts say.  And people were quoted in a Time Magazine cover story. 
[01:34:00]  People are getting up and leaving.  Oh, man.  I don't want to leave this show.  If he has another...  Hold on.  Let's give him a big plug now.  I want to bring this guy to Canada and just make him a bomb there, like a rock star.  Ian Halpert.  It's called Brangelina.  I'll say this about Ian, man.  You were on time with Michael Jackson's book.  You have a ballsy dude.  He says...  You hear celebrity books are usually very soft.  He comes right out and goes, no, no.  She tried to have herself fucking killed.  Yeah.  It's like...  I'll say that.  If you want to read stuff that is explosive, I admire you for that, man. 
[01:34:30]  You're a ballsy dude.  My body's found in the Hudson.  I've willed it all to this show.  Oh, nice.  Just to let you know.  No, no, no.  The first time Ian was on, we had an argument, and then he was willing to come back two days  later.  I love a guy like that.  See, Ventura's a wimp, because this guy knows his shit, man.  Like, I've been telling everybody around the world, they've seen this video on YouTube.  I said, look, this guy knew his shit, and I'm not going to argue with him.  He took me on, and that's cool.  We shook hands after him.  You know, that's good radio.  We actually love you now, Ian.  We didn't like you at first, but...  Ventura...  We can come back any time.  I hope Ventura's listening to this today, because I would like... 
[01:35:00]  Me and Jim, I'm challenging Ventura.  I will rent out Madison Square Garden myself, and the two of us going against Ventura.  Oh, that's true.  Tag team.  I'm willing to do it.  Two corpses.  You'll find two bloody raped men and Jesse babbling into the microphone.  A conspiracy.  And let me tell you, Ventura will be back on this show when his book comes out in April.  I have no doubt about it.  He already said no, but I guarantee...  He'll be back here in a heartbeat.  He's got to sell books.  Because this is the place to be, right, Ian?  It is the place to be. 
[01:35:30]  Open and empty.  Thank you for having me.  Peace out.  Ian Halpern, out of here.  Thanks, man.  And this, brother.  It's called Brangelina.  Yeah.  I love the guy.  All right.  Oh, he's still here.  He can hear us talking about...  Ian Halpern.  Yeah, the book's Brangelina.  This is Suzanne Callahan from the New York Post, who's one of the most up-and-coming,  greatest writers you'll see.  Like, you know, I'm telling you, writers like this, I take my hat off to them.  They're the next generation, and she'll be on this show with her books. 
[01:36:00]  She's amazing.  Did you have her in Canada?  No.  No.  We're good friends.  I'm just a fan of her.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm here to come along today, and...  Can you have your publisher send us, like, maybe one or two?  They sent one book for the whole radio show.  It's a recession.  All right.  No, seriously.  Find the goddamn book.  You're lucky you even got this.  They wanted to...  It's a recession.  No, what?  They wanted to send it in a word funnel to you guys.  Fair enough.  Cut it up and section it off.  Pass it around.  That's good.  I think we're going to be good friends with Ian Halpern over the years.  That fucking guy does great radio. 
[01:36:30]  And I'll tell you one thing, man.  He says...  It's refreshing to interview somebody.  Dude, because he backs up his shit.  Who isn't afraid of at least fucking backing up what he said in the book?  Look, I tape people saying this, so go ahead.  Come after me.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  When we get back, we got the audio that led up to Jesse Ventura leaving the show.  Yes.  Because it's not represented properly on the video that's pretty much everywhere today.  Because it's 20 minutes missing, which was just the way it was filmed.  We didn't know at the time.  Right, right, right.  We try to film when we can.  We filmed a little of the Ian Halpern thing. 
[01:37:00]  But we weren't able to keep the cameras rolling the whole time, because this company doesn't  understand that this show really needs a visual element.  We had a nice visual element that they took away from us.  There's a lot this company doesn't understand.  They don't understand half the shit.  They weren't working that fucking video yesterday whatsoever.  And now it's all over the goddamn world, because we worked it.  I'm on a serious...  Some mentioned it to me as John Norton.  Is that true?  Some fans...  Who's John Norton?  I don't know that...  John Norton.  I'm not going to kill the PR department until I know that that's true.  All right.  But it wouldn't surprise me. 
[01:37:30]  Well, when we get back...  Let's get John Norton.  Unless that's my title for most women.  When we get back, the audio that led to Jesse leaving the show.  Yes.  So you could really hear what went on and led up to it, okay?  And Brewer's stopping by today.  Our last guest of the day.  Brewer's going to be talking about his neighbor.  He's fucking pissed at his neighbor, and he's got lawyers and police reports, all sorts of  shit going on.  So he'll explain when he gets here within the hour.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  A couple of quickies.  First of all, you didn't wish Ozzie a happy birthday. 
[01:38:00]  Did I know it was his birthday?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, December 3rd.  Shit.  There you go.  God damn it, I didn't know that.  61 years old, Ozzie Ozzie.  Is he 61?  Yeah.  Wow.  61 years young.  Amazing.  That's right.  Also, yeah, the Nets did it.  We don't talk NBA basketball much on this show, but when you've got a team that sucks  as bad as the Nets, you've got to pay a little attention.  They have officially set the record for the worst start to an NBA game.  Ever.  At 0-18.  Do we need the audio on this?  Probably not, right?  What is it?  I guess real fast. 
[01:38:30]  It's 30 seconds.  There's a new record for a start of the season futility in the NBA.  New Jersey's Nets dropped their 18th straight game Wednesday night, losing at home to the  Dallas Mavericks, 117-101.  The Nets eclipsed the 17-game record shared by the 1988-89 Miami Heat and the 1999 Los  Angeles Clippers.  Newly appointed coach Kiki Van de Wey was not on the bench for the game.  He makes his debut as the replacement for the recently fired Lawrence Frank on Friday.  The Nets were never in this game, as the Mavs made 17 of 19 shots in the second quarter 
[01:39:00]  when they opened up a 27-point lead.  Not many fans were on hand for the game, and those that were showed their displeasure with  the current state of the Nets.  Wow.  This team is really bad, too.  They're getting blown out of all these games.  I would love to have heard the crowd or something, a booing, or perhaps the call of the game, and  somebody going, well, that's it, the buzzer, and then the announcer's going, well, that's  not that guy going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:39:30]  You know what?  He's one of our go-to guys.  We've got to find another go-to guy.  I hate listening to that guy's voice, but there you go, the Nets 0-18.  And then an update on the Remove Your Hat guy.  Yep.  Remember the Remove Your Hat gentleman?  It's legendary on this show.  What's the story?  You got a 100-year-old woman, or she was about 98, 99 at the time?  No, I think she was like 101 or something like that.  It was ridiculous.  I think she's 101 now.  Really?  How old a bitch was she?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  How old was that bitch?  Well, she was old.  Yeah.  And if you go to YouTube, Opie and Anthony Remove Your Hat is a video that does very, very well. 
[01:40:00]  Just goddamn hysterical.  That will somehow haunt us.  Yes, of course.  So she's getting out of an elevator, and there's a gentleman.  A gentleman, yes.  As she gets out of the elevator, and she has a walker.  And apparently they have a little chit-chat.  Yes.  And he belts her on the side of the head and knocks her over.  Well, what it was, it was a trivia contest.  And she answered the question wrong.  First prize was gumballs. 
[01:40:30]  Second prize was a shattered jaw with fucking chicken grease on it and your fucking wallet stolen.  The worst part is where he just holds her like her chin and gives her two, three good pops to the face.  Yeah, yeah.  Wham, wham.  And then she just goes down.  And then the knockdown shot.  The knockdown shot when her hair goes flying.  Yeah.  That shock of white hair.  Oh, Jesus.  Down goes the old lady.  And Peter Graves hits the ground.  You ever seen a grown man hang it? 
[01:41:00]  But this guy fucked with three women.  This broad who was close to 100 at the time.  Another one that was, I think, in her 80s.  And then another one that was a bit younger.  But yeah.  All troublemakers in the neighborhood.  Of course.  I don't know who said it yesterday.  Wearing hats.  It might have been Anthony, but it just shows you how bad our legal system is.  Because finally.  This was 2007.  Two years ago this happened.  And finally yesterday they sentenced this animal to 75 years in prison.  Don't forget they didn't catch him for a while though.  Ah, for a couple weeks. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, it was no time.  And two years it took.  Two years they couldn't figure out that this guy was guilty, especially with the videotape they had.  Two years a taxpayer's money, and I'm sure his motherfucking defense attorney trying to say it was the drugs or the upbringing or racism or whatever the fuck it was.  He's bashing old ladies in the face.  How about you have a speedy trial and put this guy behind bars for, yeah, 75 years.  How did they catch him?  Because that video is honestly, you can't see his face in the video. 
[01:42:00]  How did they get this guy?  Oh my God.  Denture cream on his knuckles.  They just found.  I'm surprised you didn't say denture cream on her knuckles.  Yes, I know.  I always do that.  What is wrong?  I'm so eager to get it out.  He's a sweet boy.  I don't know how they call him.  Joke dyslexia.  But the headline is he's finally going away for the rest of his life, and it took two years.  Unless he gets out, some politician will probably be like, oh, well, let him out, and then he'll speak.  Speaking of which, last night I tweeted the fucking dead cop killer pic. 
[01:42:30]  I got it in my text.  Somebody texted me that picture.  Well, we all got the same cop friends.  Yeah.  And then during the compound show, I popped it up so everybody could see it.  And oh, the poor gentleman.  Seemed to have had a couple of extra holes in his body.  What was weird about that picture, it's a photo of a dead guy with holes in him, but they're covering up his dick.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I guess that was too offensive.  That's very offensive.  You don't want to see his dick. 
[01:43:00]  I mean.  You do.  You don't want to see his weenie.  Wouldn't you cover up the body?  No.  You want to see the...  No, trust me.  Most people wanted to see this guy's dead picture.  They showed as much as they possibly could without looking like, you know, Al Qaeda or the Taliban or something.  One of those wounds...  You see this picture of me here?  Yeah, I did see.  Apparently one happened during the shooting of the four police officers. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, really?  Which one?  I'm thinking it's the one in the side, closer to the side than dead center because it looks like it's bruised and a little older than the one in his belly.  The belly shot looks fucking fatal.  That one is ripping apart organs.  It looks dead center, mid-mass, if that went straight, spine, aorta, you know, coming down, well, whatever that is that comes down and then splits down your legs. 
[01:44:00]  Like, there's some major shit where that bullet went in right there.  Dead, good fucking riddance.  He's done.  And do we care that Meredith Baxter is gay?  I remember her as Meredith Baxter-Burney.  From family time.  Yes.  Yes.  She's a Lisboa.  She decided at, what, 60 that she's gay?  Well, she's no longer Meredith Baxter-Burney.  Now she's Meredith Baxter-  She's been in, what, a gay relationship for seven years or something? 
[01:44:30]  I think so.  I have no idea.  I guess she got bored and...  Did you have a clue that she might be gay when we were watching that family time?  There was something weird about her.  Like, I never found her attractive.  She had some weird look to her that wasn't...  She...  When she was younger, she was pretty, but there was something kind of odd about her.  There was that one scene that was actually weird when Skippy came in and she grabbed Tina Yothers by the hair and said, 
[01:45:00]  Hey, wash your face with my pussy.  I didn't see that episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was kind of...  I'm going to have to get the box set.  That was one of the Christmas specials.  Very special episode.  Extremely special episode.  So...  Wow.  But she's, uh...  All right, well, good for her.  Whatever.  Now she's, uh...  She should have announced...  It's just odd that...  Why are these people announcing they're gay when they're old, man?  Well, she was married and everything.  She decided seven years ago that she was gay.  Before that, she was like a hetero. 
[01:45:30]  What the hell is that all about?  I don't know, man.  If she announced it earlier on, she could have got some quality pussy.  She probably can still as Meredith Baxter.  Right.  Do we most...  Now all...  You see the latest picture of her?  Yes.  At time.  We say it all the time, but it is a bitch.  You know what happens with all of these fucking sitcom actors and actresses that you remember  from your youth?  They are all hawking insurance plans on television now.  That's their gig.  They're sitting with a fuzzy camera in front of them on a little chair, sipping some tea, 
[01:46:00]  going, I have to supplement my Medicaid with blah, blah, whatever kind of insurance it is.  That's all they're doing now.  Or like Lindsay Wagner selling her goddamn inflatable mattresses.  That fucking...  I'm a number...  I'm 20 years...  The best one I think you brought to the show is the Sally Field.  Sally Field.  I could give a shit about her fucking...  Her utz pretzel bones that are apparently snapping if you blow on her leg with a Boniva. 
[01:46:30]  I just take my once a month Boniva and there she is doing yoga.  She's that cute little pixie in the air.  The flying nun and...  Smokey in the bandit.  Come on.  And now we have to think about her having brittle bones.  Osteoporosis.  All right.  And then there's the $6 million man doing the bionic hearing aid commercial.  Well, she probably had great bones until fucking Burt Reynolds put his fist in him.  Maybe that's...  You don't think they yield properly? 
[01:47:00]  No, your cheekbones are the ones that are broken.  And then fucking Starsky has to be like, you're stuck on a treadmill.  Talking about credit shit.  It's like all these guys you remember and these women you remember being hot and the guys  you remember being the hero of the show.  And now they're just hawking shit.  We got Jimmy in North Carolina.  He's got some info on this Meredith Baxter thing.  Yes, Jimmy?  Yeah, apparently Michael J. Fox is all shook up about the matter. 
[01:47:30]  That was terrible.  The best part?  The confidence in Jimmy's voice.  He knew that would work.  Oh, that's a terrible joke.  Sometimes you just know it's going to work, right?  We don't need the audio on this one, do we?  About what?  Are we talking about...  No way.  Do we care?  No, of course we don't care.  Unless she's spitting pubes out every other line.  I decided to be a lesbian.  And she's talking like Hyman Roth.  So I said that...  I know I have a partner. 
[01:48:00]  If the double-dung dildo's on the table.  And New York State, they're not going to be legalized in that gay marriage anytime soon.  Boy, that has really taken a fucking...  I thought this was going to be an easy fight for gay marriage.  No way.  You're talking 32 states voting against gay marriage at this point.  And California, too.  32 fucking states.  You know, you would think.  No, but there's California, there's Sacramento.  There's a lot of places in California that aren't L.A. or San Francisco. 
[01:48:30]  San Francisco and L.A., yeah.  New York, you would think, being a very democratic state.  But, yeah.  Even a lot of Democrats are against it, which I think is ridiculous.  They're going to have to go back to the drawing board.  That's a tough fight.  The tough fight continues.  Now, we get back to the Jesse Ventura.  I got the audio in front of me.  I know we're going to go to Jimmy in a second here.  The audio of what led to Jesse leaving the show, because the video, which most of us have seen by now, it's everywhere, doesn't really do it justice, because we weren't rolling. 
[01:49:00]  So we got the audio portion where you could see why Jesse walked out finally, okay?  But before that, you have a problem with our pal Richard Huff.  Yeah, it's not a...  Richard Huff calls our show from time to time.  He's in the Daily News, right?  Yeah, he writes the Daily News.  Writes about TV and radio and entertainment and whatnot.  And they gave me a cool little mention.  I didn't even know it was in the Daily News until Kenny told me.  Oh!  Which, normally, he just gives you horrible news.  This was actually good news.  It was nice in the back.  Page 84. 
[01:49:30]  It was a Ventura...  He thought it was the obituaries.  That's why I gave it to you.  Congratulations!  You're dead!  It's, uh...  Don't invite Jim Norton, conspiracy theory host Jesse Ventura to the same party.  Ventura and Norton verbally sparred on yesterday's Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM Radio.  But I bring nothing to the company, so why would you take care of me?  And things got so heated, Ventura walked off the program.  If you're not going to let me talk, I'm out the door, Ventura said, as they argued over going to war.  You've been talking the whole time. 
[01:50:00]  And all you do is yell over people.  Norton shot back, and I should add, cleverly.  20 minutes later, as the debate raged, Ventura got up to leave.  Norton told Ventura he was sulking.  There's an effing guy here telling me I've got a schedule, Ventura said, adding an obscenity.  Ventura touched Norton's shoulder as he left.  Thanks for touching me with your effing stupid, rip-roaring, Rocky Horror hairdo.  Norton shot back, rip-roaring, see?  No, Norton didn't.  It's the wine of the year, and he blew it in print. 
[01:50:30]  And he did try to hear it, he just couldn't, you know, I think...  Oh, you could hear it.  If you're familiar, everybody's familiar with riff-raff from Rocky Horror,  and you absolutely know the reference, especially somebody in the entertainment journalism field like that.  There it is, too.  I said you're a riff-raff from Rocky Horror hairdo.  Yes.  Rip-roaring.  Yeah, rip-roaring.  So we're going to get Richard Huff on the phone to explain himself.  And he's promised me a full-page retraction with a humble apology. 
[01:51:00]  Humble being the keyword.  I think you're pushing the Tiger Woods off the front page so they can run your...  As it should be.  No one cares about Ellen.  This won't be.  Hey, why don't we play the audio?  So this is what led to Jesse leaving.  And I have to run out and come right back.  Because I have a thing to do.  Oh, you do.  Okay, that's fine.  You don't need to answer the audio.  All right.  Here it is.  This is what led to Jesse leaving.  I remember doing the time warp.  Jimmy, it's just a jump to the left. 
[01:51:30]  You weren't there.  Your car didn't break down in the rain.  But this is how it went down.  Because the video just doesn't do it justice.  Here you go.  We're also profiling the Mexicans.  We should profile.  We profile the Italians for the mafia.  You profile bikers for health.  Yeah.  Profiling works to a certain degree.  Yeah.  As long as citizens are afforded a certain amount of respect.  And I like the fact that now we don't even do it at the borders.  Where are Mexicans being profiled? 
[01:52:00]  Well, I drive across every year.  And now the last time I drove across the border, I showed my passport at the border.  And I was two hours into Arizona on the freeway.  And I had to do a two-hour stop there because the cars were backed up because there was an immigration stop in the middle of Arizona.  Not at the border.  But that seems logical.  Really?  We've got to cross.  Well, it only goes against our Constitution, but what the hell.  DWI checkpoints do it too, technically. 
[01:52:30]  No.  Our Constitution says you can travel freely inside the United States.  So DWI checkpoints also.  No, no, no, no.  Why?  Because that's driving a car and a license and you're dealing with a cop.  Same thing here.  No, it isn't the same.  This is immigration.  So what?  You're checking to see if...  So what?  You're a citizen.  You're not being hassled if you're a citizen.  Yes, you are.  You're asked to produce.  I already did it at the border.  Same as DWI checkpoints.  You're asked to prove your sobriety.  No, it's different.  It's not different.  Yes, it is.  It's different because it doesn't prove your point, but it's not different.  Because driving is a privilege. 
[01:53:00]  Yes, they weren't stopping citizens walking.  They were stopping them.  No, driving is a privilege.  You don't have a right to drive.  Right, exactly.  It's a privilege.  But you have a right to be a citizen.  It's your right not to be questioned inside the United States if you're a citizen.  So you think we...  Don't the police have the right to ask you...  This isn't the police.  This isn't the police.  You're talking about the Border Patrol.  This is immigration.  Immigration.  Oh, okay.  So what right does immigration have to pull me over in the middle of Arizona  and ask me to produce papers that I'm a citizen? 
[01:53:30]  That seems a little shifty.  Yeah, but they were stopping people because they wanted to make sure that they weren't  illegals.  They weren't looking for you.  So what if they ask you to produce?  And I mean that.  I refused.  Of course you did.  Because you're a recognizable guy.  Because I believe in the Constitution.  So do I.  But again, it's not a suicide...  No, you don't.  Because you're saying that this is okay.  You're right.  I don't believe in the Constitution.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I don't believe in the Constitution.  You're violating it.  No, I'm not.  I'm exercising my free speech.  Boo-hoo.  Oh, Jesus.  And time. 
[01:54:00]  Wow.  I love the Constitution.  It really has to go at this point.  It troubles me because...  I don't like the perverse use of the Constitution.  We're out in the middle in the United States and you're asked to produce your citizenship  when you've already done it at the border.  And our country has never made us have to produce any type of thing like that just to  freely travel about the country.  Where are your papers?  Do you have to produce your...  Where are your papers?  Can you leave Minnesota into South Dakota?  And I foresee in the future they're going to have right at the borders, state to state, 
[01:54:30]  where you're going to have to produce paperwork to go from one state to the next.  It's called EasyPass now.  And that's called taking away your freedoms in light of keeping us safe.  Slippery...  That's what you'd say to the police doing our police work.  Let's keep us safe.  That's what you'd say about the police doing our police work.  I said you would.  Police work, that ain't police work, that's immigration.  But if it wasn't a cop, say the cop had done it.  No, no, no, it ain't a cop.  You said it's all police work to stop terrorists.  A cop can pull you over.  So if they started questioning people in a mosque, you'd say, oh, that's racist. 
[01:55:00]  A cop can pull you over in demand.  Don't put words in my mouth, please.  You both talk for me.  You did it to me.  You said I don't believe in the Constitution.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Jess.  Governor, please.  You always just sulk and walk away.  Why?  You put words in my mouth.  There's a fucking guy here telling me I got a schedule, asshole.  You're using dirty language, asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bye, tough guy.  Bye, tough guy.  And thanks for your service to our country.  You're welcome.  Thanks for touching me with your fucking stupid riffraff fucking Rocky Horror hairdo. 
[01:55:30]  You're bigger than me and stronger than me.  So what?  I don't give a shit.  You want to beat me up?  Go ahead.  I'm not going to fight a guy like you.  That means nothing to me.  I know.  I argued with you.  You put words in my mouth and you didn't like when I did it to you.  You put words in my mouth saying I didn't believe in the Constitution and that's bullshit.  It's not true.  I don't agree with abusing it.  Thank you for your service.  Oh, you're welcome.  You're a bigger patriot than me.  Godspeed. 
[01:56:00]  Fuck out of here.  What happened?  It's a fucking baby.  That ended on a nice note.  Who gives a shit?  A big fucking guy that doesn't like the little guy yelling.  You scared him, Jimmy.  No, here's what that is.  He wanted to knock my fucking block off, but he knows that he shouldn't or he can't because of the law or all this stuff.  Fuck you.  I don't care because I fucking hate that shit. 
[01:56:30]  What happened, Sam?  I really do.  Don't.  You know what?  I bowed you.  I would never.  So do I.  I would never.  I saw the look Jesse was giving you.  I don't care.  I would never try to challenge a guy like that physically and I don't posture that way.  He would murder me.  You're like fucking Spider.  You're just like Spider.  I want to talk to your money.  I would never talk tough guy talk.  I was arguing an ideological point.  I would never get in Jesse Ventura's face and think I'm going to outman him.  That was not my point. 
[01:57:00]  I've never done that.  Don't fucking tough guy me.  I hate that.  He was tough.  I'll fuck him.  I don't care how strong he is.  I hate that.  You are.  Bravo to Jim.  That drives me nuts, man.  That's that's my fucking pet peeve.  I hate it.  Suicide by wrestler was what he was trying.  Holy shit.  It's not a tough guy thing.  The guy would.  It's not about that.  I'm not going to fight Jesse Ventura.  I just I can't be bullied.  It makes me fuck.  Fuck you.  I hate it.  How do you feel when he tapped your shoulder? 
[01:57:30]  Annoyed.  Not intimidated.  Annoyed.  Annoyed.  Thank you for your service.  He didn't do it hard.  It wasn't a threatening.  Yeah.  But it was.  Don't try to alpha male me stupid.  Danny's just put up a picture of the Crypt Keeper.  Danny's real brave.  Jimmy's the only one that opened his mouth like a man.  Fucking dude.  Like a man.  That drives me crazy.  That was a great ending.  That drives me nuts.  Wow.  What is he saying down the hall there?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I'm just curious.  I asked him if when his book comes out in April he'd be happy to come back because despite 
[01:58:00]  the tumult that really sounded well.  He goes nope.  Not doing it.  Good.  Fuck you.  Bye.  Don't.  We're done with him?  Don't.  We've had intense discussions with the guy.  I walked with him to the elevator and I said governor I know that your feelings  may have gotten hurt and you don't like Jim.  Who cares?  I don't like him either.  He's a sulker.  I don't respect that little shit.  I don't respect him either.  I respect his military service but I think he's a fucking.  I don't respect him in a debate because he's a baby who pushes his microphone. 
[01:58:30]  Aww.  What's the matter?  You're not used to being challenged by a small guy you fucking big dumb wrestler?  I fucking hate that shit.  I mean.  By the way.  I never.  It's not like I stood up and go what.  I would never do that dude.  People are saying best ending ever.  By the way.  Yes.  We did get that on video and boy will that.  Oh yeah.  I don't give a shit if he comes back.  That's a big one.  I don't care.  That's a big one right there.  That's a big one.  I don't.  I swear to God.  I don't care if he comes back.  Wait till you see Jesse's face on that video. 
[01:59:00]  He's.  Honest to God.  He.  He wanted to strangle you.  Too bad.  I know.  Then don't argue with me on the radio.  Just bully me in an alley like you probably would have if you weren't a dumb fucking wrestler.  I fucking hate big guys.  I'm afraid of Jimmy.  No.  I'm not.  Be more funny.  Dude I really.  I hate that shit.  I fucking hate that shit.  Bravo.  I mean there's nothing.  I hate it.  Honestly there's nothing I can say.  The listeners can say.  Anthony can say.  It's a.  It's a bravo all the way around.  So.  Trust me.  I would never have.  Me and I saw the look that Jesse gave you. 
[01:59:30]  Bravo.  Wait till you see this fucking video.  Nose to nose.  And just.  You did not back down an iota.  But stay.  No.  I won't back down.  I know.  That's just it.  But again.  If it came down to a real fight.  The acknowledgement is.  The guy's going to murder me.  I'm not going to fight Jesse.  It's not about that.  It's an argument.  Even if it was a small guy.  Or a woman I was arguing with.  Which is what I am to him.  It was that whole push the mic away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Don't try to fucking.  Alpha mail me in an argument.  That's what he was doing.  We had a really good discussion with the guy too.  Why did it have to end there?  Because he's a guy like. 
[02:00:00]  You know what.  I.  I.  I'll tell you.  I know why.  I started fading out.  I'll be completely honest.  What got to him at the end there?  I didn't like when he goes.  Well you don't like the constitution.  He doesn't like me because I don't agree with him.  And I'm fucking.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  He put fucking words in my mouth.  And then he put words again.  And then he called me an asshole.  And I called him an asshole.  And when Jimmy called him out on putting words in his mouth.  He had no defense for it.  Because that's what he is.  He's one of those big bully motherfuckers.  Who likes to use his size and his weight.  And he talks over everybody.  And he's not a dumb guy.  I'm not going to say.  So what?  Fuck him.  He's not a dumb guy. 
[02:00:30]  He's not a dumb guy.  I just want to see Jimmy.  I just disagree with him.  Don't turn around Jimmy.  Don't turn around.  I respect the guy's military service.  I respect the guy.  He's a bright dude.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's just more radical than I am.  But that.  When you're arguing.  And that disagreeing.  That fucking.  Like that's all of a sudden the atomic bomb.  I'm going to use my.  Fuck you man.  You know what you should do?  Bend him over and humble him.  You fuck in the ass.  I fuck you in the ass and humble you.  I don't care if he.  That little shit.  That's what I think of you.  You big fat motherfucker.  Beat it.  Steve.  There was.  There was a point. 
[02:01:00]  No.  I'm sorry.  Anthony.  There was a point when Jimmy turned all the way around.  Jesse was at the doorway.  Jesse was debating.  I'm coming back in.  So much.  Oh yeah he was.  No I'm just saying.  I know he was.  I'm just painting the picture for everyone.  There was a moment there where.  I was scared for you.  I wasn't.  At all.  I think I got to go back in there and hit this guy.  I was scared for you.  Because.  Because at the last second turned and walked away.  Because when he drank his water and finished the bottle.  I thought he was going to throw the bottle in your face.  And I would have thrown mine at him and got the shit beat out of me.  Believe me.  That's what I was thinking.  That's why I started getting afraid.  And then Kenny would have had to come in and. 
[02:01:30]  Oh it would have been awful.  Kenny.  I want to talk to Kenny for a minute.  I want to know what Kenny was thinking.  I've been boxing lately.  I would have tried something.  Would you knock it off?  Dude I would be annoyed at a small guy.  For pushing the microwave during an argument.  Right.  When Jesse was having a lot of time to say what he had to say.  Yeah.  We were arguing back and forth.  He felt I put words in his mouth.  I felt he put words in mine.  But then to drop it like that.  Goodbye.  I know.  Fuck you.  Goodbye.  We're promoting your show for the last 20 minutes.  Ask plenty of legitimate questions. 
[02:02:00]  Yes.  Let him get his point across over and over again.  It drives me crazy.  Kenny.  Where would have been that fail safe point where you had to jump in.  Because you held off.  You didn't do anything.  You didn't get in between anybody.  What were you thinking during that whole thing?  I was keeping my eye on him.  Yeah.  Now what would you think if you had to go against Jesse Ventura?  Bye Jim.  Opie and Anthony moving right along. 
[02:02:30]  Look who's in studio.  Our old friend Jim Brewer.  Brewer.  That was great.  That was like some backyard hanging with Norton and Jesse.  Jesse Ventura.  Sure.  Because I do side with Jesse's views a lot.  I love thinking that stuff.  Sure.  Love it.  So I love.  There's times I listen to you guys and I want to strangle Anthony.  I'm like you so-so-so-why sitting next to him.  You're like are you fucking kidding me?  But I love that shit.  It was great radio yesterday. 
[02:03:00]  It was great discussion.  It is crazy of me to just think that some terrorist decided to fly planes into buildings and kill people.  Here we go.  Instead of some wild harebrained scheme that could not possibly be pulled.  I'm not going to go into it.  I'm not going to go into it.  We've been here too long.  The five surviving hijackers actually are doing Desperate Housewives in Saudi Arabia.  They're beheading them.  It was a nice hit for the show and Jimmy especially man.  That fucking Ventura video is everywhere and it's got people talking. 
[02:03:30]  Speaking of which Brewer called me the last couple of days.  He's like I got to come on the show to talk about a certain person in his neighborhood that's driving you nuts to the point.  I think police are involved.  Lawyers are involved.  Police.  I've never seen Jim like this.  Never seen him aggressive and fucking chomping at the bit.  Never.  This is stuff you see on television.  Dude I'm going to churches asking fucking pastors to pray for me and shit.  It's that fucking bad.  I'm going will you please pray for me that I don't do something stupid.  Just because I want to do something stupid. 
[02:04:00]  I would never sacrifice my wife or kids or family but this guy is such.  What could he possibly be doing?  Start from the beginning.  First of all from the minute he moved in my neighborhood shady.  Shady.  Now you had lived there already.  Lived there already.  Having a great time loving your neighborhood.  Riding bicycles.  Up and down.  Bling bling.  Fucking enjoying life. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  Avoiding the deer.  Go karts.  A little deer action.  A little.  You got like a herd.  That's not right.  I accepted that part of my life.  Wait I just figured something out.  Trampolines in the yard.  Having fun.  Having fun.  Hold on Jim.  Yes.  Eating pies.  Brewer.  What?  Yes.  Alright.  But I don't want to.  Yes.  Alright.  Alright.  I know what's going on.  You've been to the house.  Yeah go ahead.  Now this guy moves.  First of all he moves in.  I'm just going to call him the pizza guy.  Okay.  And anyone in New Jersey in the Chester area knows exactly what I'm talking about immediately. 
[02:05:00]  Alright.  Now pizza guy.  First of all he moves in.  When he moves in he moves in at between midnight and two in the morning for like four straight days.  Immediately I'm like what?  Red flag.  Big red flag.  Vampire.  Island.  Not Sparato on the mailbox.  The way.  This is the way he introduced himself to me.  I'm in my yard. 
[02:05:30]  And with my family.  Kids.  He comes strolling in my yard.  He looks like.  He looks like Al Pacino in Godfather.  He's got this dead eye creepy death look.  And he's always got a Marlboro Red hanging.  And he talks like this.  He goes.  He goes.  Listen.  I live cross street.  I was in your yard five in the morning.  And.  And I want to.  I want to spear a buck. 
[02:06:00]  Can I spear.  No.  Hey.  How are you?  Are these the kids?  Because of my fucking yard.  I want to spear a buck.  I said.  What are you talking about?  What's a buck?  He goes.  A deer.  Buck.  I want to spear him.  In your yard.  I want your permission.  You the boss.  Right?  I said.  Hold on a second.  What?  What is it?  This is my mom.  This is my dad.  This is my nieces.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has a big backyard.  Just so people know.  And there are.  Apparently.  There are herds of deer that just go flying by. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  At different times of the day.  We're not talking Pennsylvania cow farm.  Yeah.  So with that.  I said.  No man.  You know what?  My wife is so freaky into animals.  If she even heard this conversation.  She'd slice your throat.  Watch the blood gurgle out.  And dance in it and laugh at you.  While you're taking less breath.  Well that's why I ask.  That's why I ask.  So two weeks later.  I'm going to have breakfast.  And my five year old goes.  Daddy.  There's a man with a rifle in the yard.  What? 
[02:07:00]  Holy shit.  I said.  What?  I look in the back.  There's some guy in camouflage.  Way out in the woods.  Going tree to tree.  And I'm like.  Holy shit.  My heart's going.  40 billion miles an hour.  Now at the time I had my nephew who lived with me.  Who's straight out of the who's gal.  All right.  So he's.  Oh shit.  He's like a human pit bull.  No.  Down.  Down.  Down.  He.  I said.  Stay in the house.  We're going to call the police.  Well him like a dope.  Goes outside. 
[02:07:30]  Now I know it's from my.  I know it's from the pizza man.  Because only the pizza man could have saw where he was standing.  And the man who went outside.  The.  The.  The rifle guy.  Instantly picked up a phone.  He took off.  So.  He's in.  He's constantly talking about his guys.  His guys.  So anyway.  This is a couple years ago.  They've cut to this summer.  Wait.  Did the cops come or no?  Oh yeah.  No.  They came.  But the guy was gone.  And this isn't even the incident yet?  Oh no.  Oh.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[02:08:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  We.  We didn't get there.  Doesn't this guy know about.  First of all this guy's asking.  What?  Doesn't this guy know about like.  You can't just hunt in.  In neighborhoods.  No.  Because apparently.  He's a bag of rocks.  Okay.  He fell off the boat.  Yeah.  Go find some land and go open up a pizza place here.  Tell me that you're going to matter.  He thinks he's 1930s.  This jackass.  He can just hunt in a neighborhood. 
[02:08:30]  He has nothing.  Funniest sound ever.  Boat.  There it is Jimmy.  Jesus.  That's what I mean about that.  The Statue of Liberty is going by a black and white.  Pizza man to make sure you're right to us.  We're going to miss you.  Pizza man.  So now.  Cut to.  He opens up a pizza joint.  Very close to the neighborhood.  I.  Every other.  Jimmy.  Big favor. 
[02:09:00]  First he goes.  Can you come do show.  Outside pizza place.  I said.  What am I rich Voss?  Voss had to send a tape.  I don't know.  Try to stop my crush.  Take that stupid.  That's fucking hilarious.  So.  It gives you the mentality of the rock of the pizza man.  I said.  I can't.  No.  I'm not going to.  So I go out.  I hang out.  He constantly calls me.  You know.  My kids. 
[02:09:30]  My delivery.  They love to.  You call me.  I mean a lot to them.  I go there.  I say hello.  He's got me doing charity.  He scares the daylights out of the neighborhood.  He bullies and barters everybody.  Everyone.  Jim.  Can I use your fax machine?  I got these faxes from Italy.  They can't understand anything.  Holy shit.  He starts me last summer.  He's like.  Where are your office at?  In the middle of the street.  Flags me down.  I said.  What are you talking about?  He goes.  I need your address.  For what?  I open up business. 
[02:10:00]  I need your address.  I said.  Oh my god.  What a set of balls.  A set of balls.  I'm not even exaggerating.  You know.  Anyone in my town will tell you.  Fucking nuts.  This guy.  So I go.  I don't know my address.  And he goes.  You know.  Know where you work?  I said.  My sister knows him.  Give me your sister number.  I swear to god.  I went.  Yeah.  Here's the number.  4-1-2-6-2-1-8.  Get out of here.  Jackass.  So. 
[02:10:30]  Oh my god.  Cut to.  Holy shit.  Cut to.  So everyone hates this guy.  Everyone's having problems with this guy in town.  That's all I hear.  It's all over the place.  This guy did this to me.  Did that to me.  And that's another thing.  He's shoving all the other pizza.  He's starting to battle with other towns.  He's like.  I'm going to run that guy out.  I go there and I threaten him.  And I told that guy in Mendham.  He piece of shit.  And his car's coming my way.  And I got to show him.  I'm like.  You're going to.  You're going to get wet.  You're going to get wet. 
[02:11:00]  Well.  Cut to this summer.  We go on a big RV trip.  Yeah.  I totally.  Totally sold out to the family world.  Love it.  Get my RV.  I'm doing gigs.  And fucking halftime gigs.  I'm on the road.  I come home.  I hear all this crazy shit.  He's going through this sick divorce.  To the point where he's turning off the heat.  He's not paying the bills.  Oh shit.  He pulls up.  As I'm unloading.  So here's where it begins.  He goes.  He gets out of.  I. 
[02:11:30]  Stupid me.  Because I like the guy.  Although he's crazy.  I've never had a problem.  You figured he was just a nut.  He's just a nut.  But he's never bothered me.  I never had a.  Yes.  Except for guns in the backyard.  Guns in the yard.  He tells me.  You know.  I'm going to.  My guys are going to take care of this guy in Italy.  Because he's taking my grandfather's gun.  So.  He's seeing what happened.  My guys show up.  But I tell you this.  Because I love you like a brother.  This is.  He loves everyone like a brother.  You don't want to hear those stories.  No.  No. 
[02:12:00]  You don't want to be involved.  But now I'm exploiting them.  Yeah.  So he pulls up.  And he goes.  Jimmy.  I said.  I put my hand on his heart.  You know man.  You need to talk.  He looks like Scarface in the third act.  When he's sitting behind the desk.  And he's just.  He's mangled.  I said.  Joe.  You all right man.  You know.  You all right.  He gets out of the car.  Lights up his Marlboro Red.  Which he chain smokes.  He's like. 
[02:12:30]  You know.  Fuck her.  My.  Let me tell you something.  He goes.  I'm going to bury my wife.  I'm going to.  You want the house.  Take the house.  You're going to foreclose.  I'm going to leave it.  I'm going to take on my son.  I'm going to bring him to Italy.  She never see him no more.  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  So he's going on and on and on.  About these horrible things.  He's going to do to the wife.  Yeah.  That's always nice to hear.  Witness.  So I'm like.  I'm like.  You know.  You really.  You should think about the kids.  He goes.  I don't give a shit.  She could have the kids.  I don't give a shit. 
[02:13:00]  I take on my son.  I go to Italy.  I make a five million dollars a year.  I got thirty nine guys working for me.  I got thrones.  At the end of the conversation.  He goes.  Listen Jimmy.  Don't take her personally.  But she's going to get a letter.  And the letter says.  You know.  The kids.  They don't come over the house.  I said.  What are you talking about?  He goes.  I don't want her to be able to bring.  She was you nowhere.  I want her slave. 
[02:13:30]  So.  I really don't know what he's talking about.  So now.  Again.  You don't know what he's talking about.  I'm really not sure what he's talking about.  And people are wondering.  If this pizza guy.  Delivers pizza with cheese.  In the ring of the crust.  Jack pie.  Jack pie.  Hence jack pie.  Right?  Jack pie.  Maybe that's what triggered it all.  You're trying to take him out of business.  See what the fuck.  He saw the commercial.  He went.  Motherfucker.  Who does this guy Jimmy do the pizza hut?  This guy.  I had the idea of the cheese into the crust. 
[02:14:00]  I don't think there's a pizza hut in Jersey.  Wait.  We're getting.  We're getting to a really good part.  Oh yeah.  No no.  It's so good.  Because he doesn't want his wife bringing the kids over to your house.  He doesn't want.  So now I hear.  Sure.  The kids are kicked out of camp.  Because someone.  You know.  She can't have babysitters.  And all this.  It's just.  Nightmare.  Now I'm starting to hear all these guys in town.  Call me on the road.  They're like.  Brewer.  What's going on with you and the pizza guy?  I said what?  You and the pizza guy.  I said what? 
[02:14:30]  What's going on?  There's.  Oh.  We walk in the restaurant.  He tells everyone you're a drug addict.  And that he's got a restraining order against you to keep away from the kids.  Holy shit.  Oh are you kidding me?  Are you.  Please tell me you're kidding me.  He's like no.  He goes bro.  I wouldn't care.  But there were like a lot of customers.  There was customers in there.  And he didn't know.  And he took it.  This is how stupid he is.  I did an article to start my new tour.  And the tour was like yeah you know I used to smoke pot.  But now I'm a family guy. 
[02:15:00]  And I don't even curse on stage.  Bring your wife.  And it's going to be great.  So he takes that.  He goes oh Jimmy do drugs.  Okay.  Now I get to bury him.  So he takes the article and he shows people.  And everyone that tells you goes.  You know this one guy calls.  This is like the fourth guy he calls.  He goes he looks retarded.  Because I read the article three times.  I go what's the problem?  He goes look he used he do marijuana.  He goes yeah but he says he used to years ago. 
[02:15:30]  What's the what are you talking about?  He goes he dead to me.  He dead to me.  So this is what I'm hearing.  You were his pal.  Your brother like a brother to him.  Yeah you guys got along.  I'm starting to get annoyed.  Now like a dope he has no clue.  My niece is in town.  He opened up a limo business.  Which is like a Harlem living business.  You know like the cars you see in Harlem.  Yeah.  You go to my town.  It's like this nice town.  This is white trash. 
[02:16:00]  Limo.  You just seen a prom in 1978.  Right.  Right.  A guy from Nicaragua dragging.  You want to go to 15, 17, and I bring you there for $180.  The bumper's not on right.  It's slightly askew.  I'm not even lying.  There's dense in the car.  Yeah.  I know.  It's dense in the car.  We all know the limo you're talking about.  Yeah.  Wow.  So he starts, she calls, she texts me, and she's like, Jam, some guy's talking about  Auntie, my wife. 
[02:16:30]  Like, what are you talking about?  This limo guy.  He brought up that he's single because his neighbors are assholes and the guy's on drugs  and the wife is crazy and ruined.  And I said, what's the guy?  Kids, I said, but I went, are you, are you fucking kidding?  So this is building up inside me.  Now the wife, they're going through the divorce.  The wife gets a letter from the lawyer going up.  The kids are no longer.  Here's the letter.  Jim Brewer is no longer allowed near my kids because he's a known drug user. 
[02:17:00]  Holy shit.  Dude.  Sorry.  I'm in a movie theater, like watching Up or something with the kids.  You're a junkie.  Yeah, he probably thinks the movie Up is about drugs.  So we finish the movie.  Now we took two cars.  My wife's turning.  She's like, don't do something stupid.  Don't, drive right home. 
[02:17:30]  I can see that look in your face.  I've never, I haven't seen this look in your face since you were 18.  You're like, no, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I go 90 miles an hour to his pizza joint.  I go to the pizza place.  I'm like, where's, where's pizza man?  Uh, he's not here.  Well, you tell him that I'm looking for him because I'm tired of his family bathing in my house  because he doesn't pay bills and he shuts off the gas and there's no electricity.  So they have to shower in my house.  You tell him that, Mr. Drug Guy. 
[02:18:00]  All right, you have him call me.  He never calls.  Never calls.  Well, you're dead to him.  Two weeks later, I'm in my yard.  Having a great day.  Wiffle ball or something?  Yes.  Rocking the wiffle ball.  I had my family, I had my parents, in-laws.  Beautiful sky.  All of a sudden, his kids come walking to my yard with the wife.  She's like, oh, he's scaring me.  He's this.  I'm like, oh, I don't need this shit.  I don't need this shit.  So my wife's like, you know, stay here.  I pull my wife's out. 
[02:18:30]  I really don't want them here.  I don't want them here.  I'm spending time.  Well, yeah, she's fucking having trouble.  Whatever.  Hour later, his kids are playing wiffle ball.  He doesn't even, he's never bought it.  He never hangs out with the kids.  Ever.  Ever.  So all of a sudden, the kids go, somebody's staring at us from the woods.  Holy Jesus, no.  Turn around.  It's Pizza Man.  He's in the neighbor's yard spying. 
[02:19:00]  So now.  This is like.  Pizza Man.  This is like a bad movie, man.  This is like a horrendous horror movie.  So Pizza Man is in the next yard spying on my family and his kids.  So the wife is like, why don't you come over here like a man?  You want to see your kids?  You're fucking nice.  I'm at the noon.  So he starts walking to his house.  And I'm like, now we're going to have our conversation.  So I don't think.  Now, everyone that works for him are like immigrants that he literally enslaves. 
[02:19:30]  If you talk to him, they're like, oh, I got to work for him because he's going to turn me in.  We're all junkies.  So I go to him and I swear to God, on a very, very human level, I swear on my kids' lives.  I go, uh, I go, Pizza Man, you want to talk to your kids?  Why don't you talk to your kids?  He won't look me in the face. 
[02:20:00]  Well, he smokes a cigarette.  He looks down at Grant.  He's circling around like a hyena waiting for the lions to finish eating the fucking gazelle.  Hey, Mocha Joe.  Pizza Man.  That's interesting.  Yeah, okay.  Very close to a, it's funny you said that.  Oh, okay.  So anyway, uh, I go, listen, uh, you want to talk to your kids?  Go talk to your kids.  What, what are you staring in the woods for?  He's, he's smoking a cigarette. 
[02:20:30]  I go, uh, listen to me.  I don't care what you've been saying around town because a lot of people coming up to me,  I don't think you realize how many people know me.  He, oh no, I said, I'm, you know, I came in the pizza place looking for you.  You really pissed me off about that drug.  He go, here's what he says.  You got that all right.  You got that right.  You had every right to be angry.  I said, well, I don't care what you say about me.  Don't talk about my wife.  He go, what are you talking about?  Now he's not supposed to have a limo business because his papers aren't done.  He's not supposed to collect money. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, so I said, my niece was in the car when you drove her.  He went ballistic.  I never drive in a fucking car.  He gets his finger in my face and now I'm thinking, all right, touch me.  Now I got my kids watching my parents.  My in-laws.  Everyone, everyone's like, oh my God, Jesus Christ, Jimmy, get in the house.  I was like, everyone be quiet.  I ain't afraid of this little fag, which is what he is.  He's a little fag. 
[02:21:30]  So, so he doesn't dare touch me.  He's, he's, he's going, dude, who are you niece?  I said, I'm not going to tell you who my niece is.  The fact is you were in the car and you were talking about me and my wife.  Don't do that.  You, you son of B.  I ain't no fuck.  I ain't no fuck.  I ain't no fuck.  I ain't no fuck.  I ain't no fuck.  And I said, don't tell your kids I'm drugs either because I'm tired of them coming over  here going, uh, hey, Mr. Jimmy, my daddy say you on drugs.  So he, he gets, he gets intimidated by me because I looked at him in the eye and I kept walking 
[02:22:00]  up to him every time he walked away.  So he turns around and he goes, you disrespect me.  Oh, no.  I said, how do I disrespect you?  He goes, I told you my kids come in your house.  You send them home.  I said, first of all, stop yelling.  And second of all, don't tell me what to do with my family.  Your kids come over to my house.  I'm not going to tell my kids what to do.  I'm not going to send your kids home.  I go, you have problems with your wife. 
[02:22:30]  You deal with your wife.  Don't, don't involve me in your bullshit.  He goes, I told you, you know what?  You're going to get, you're going to get it on a Tuesday.  And he starts walking away.  He starts walking away like Tuesday.  You're going to get it on a Tuesday.  Now Tuesday, I'm going to LA.  And so I'm like, oh my God, I got to leave this nut ball with my wife and kids.  What does that mean?  I'm going to get it Tuesday.  On Tuesday.  It's not called the cops.  I didn't call the cops.  Someone in the family called the cops when this is going on. 
[02:23:00]  Cops come.  I get, all I'm going to say is, that's when I got scared.  And they were like, that guy?  Oh no.  Oh, shit.  All right.  They just stay clear.  They're like, dude.  So I do my own investigating as for, he's up for, apparently he's up for assault.  This is what a bag of rocks his jackass is. 
[02:23:30]  Holy shit.  Why are you on our show telling this?  This is great.  This bag of rocks, there's a town pool.  Did you do the noise again for the bag of rocks?  Hey, piece of man, take your bag of rocks.  And remember, if anybody confronts you, you come to mama.  Mama give you a hug.  And mama make you a sauce.  I can come here with nothing but the change in my pocket. 
[02:24:00]  He's going to leave with nothing, too.  So they're calling this Brewer's Lakeview Terrace.  So bag of rocks.  The cops show up.  Cops show up.  I'm not even going to say what I learned there.  But they said, listen, we're going to make a police report.  Did you learn some bad stuff, though?  I learned bad stuff.  I learned bad stuff.  I learned bad stuff.  Multiple bad stuff.  Multiple bad stuff.  Were you scared or angry?  Both.  Okay.  More angry. 
[02:24:30]  Because, especially what happened right after this.  This is when I got egg.  This is when my blood level went through the roof.  And so now, just to give you an idea, this jackass in town, he's up for assault with a  deadly weapon.  But it sounds worse than it is.  Right.  Basically, what he did was, this is what a bag of rocks he is.  Some guy came to the town pool, which he bullied himself into.  He literally was sending fish and letters to the guy that had the place. 
[02:25:00]  Can I, can I, can I, I gotta, I gotta help not, this doesn't need help, but I've been to  Brewer's house in his neighborhood.  This is like the most peaceful.  Beyond peaceful.  It's like the epitome of suburbia.  This is what I got worried about, too.  And you got this guy just like, just wheeling everybody.  We live in a place, he had about 50 trees in front of his house.  I used to walk out and stare at woods and trees and chop down every, three straight weeks. 
[02:25:30]  He wants to cement the place so bad.  Dude, he's so stupid.  This guy comes to me, living there one month.  He go, Jim, guess what?  First of all, you need to know, you know what they call me?  The Italian Jew.  I said, really?  He goes, that's right.  Because I got Italian and I know how to Jew people down.  Now he drives like 90 miles up my driveway. 
[02:26:00]  Kids out of the car, can't wait to tell me this.  What's up, Pete's man?  He goes, I just bought two horses, two thoroughbred.  I name them Zambuc and Espresso.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I swear to my kids' lives.  He goes, how much do you think I, how much do you think I'd buy the horse for?  I said, first of all, who gives a shit?  Second of all, Pete's man, I don't know.  How is, I don't know.  He go, go ahead.  Guess one, he thoroughbred.  The other one, he prized wiener. 
[02:26:30]  16,000.  He go, 5,000 for the both of them.  I said, all right.  Two weeks later, he's burying them in the backyard.  I've got horse flies the size of my pinky fucking up my summers for like the last three  years.  He's got sheep.  He comes in my house.  He just needed the heads.  Probably.  He comes over my house.  He's like, you know, how about I chop down your trees?  Oh, great.  I want to put my livestock here. 
[02:27:00]  I said, Derek, you're not going to Pennsylvania.  You're not going to my house to create a farm.  Are you retarded?  Are you re...  Make sure you take your bag of rocks, see?  Take your bag of rocks and pizza man.  Holy shit.  And when people question you, you show them the bag of rocks and say, that's in my head.  Fucking guy.  All right, so the pool.  The pool, he spooks the guy.  So this guy at the pool.  Now, this is all public records. 
[02:27:30]  I don't mind talking about it.  You can go and check out any police report on him.  Police report is, this is how the bag of rocks, the guy's like, you know, I'm eating a sandwich.  Leave me alone.  He's going, you take a business away from me.  You can no eat here.  He goes, you know, you can fuck yourself.  He goes, I'm going to kick your ass.  The guy calls a cop because he threatens, I'm going to kill you.  Cops come.  What day did he pencil his death in?  Yeah.  Oh, he's got about 50 guys.  Well, Tuesday, I'm busy with the brewery. 
[02:28:00]  I know you're Tuesday, but I come to you on Thursday night.  Right at the third delivery.  This guy, so the cops come.  This jackass, while the cops are there, already settled the situation.  He goes, no, this is no way I do things.  I show you how I do things.  Goes to his car, opens his trunk, and takes out a freaking police billy club.  So they're like, oh, illegal. 
[02:28:30]  Hands on the roof, bump, in the car.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  He goes, this is the way I do it.  So now that's assault.  You went to assault.  He's also up for gun charges, too, because that's another whole thing.  So, cut to later that night, after I, after.  After the cops go, whoo.  Is that the next?  Yes.  Okay.  So now I've got to leave the next day to L.A., and I'm a little worried.  And they said, we're going to be in your driveway.  Don't worry about it.  He comes down here.  He drives a mile over the limit. 
[02:29:00]  Don't worry about it.  Now, every day, his goons drive up and down my neighborhood.  Every freaking day.  They steal her mail.  Jackass.  Holy shit.  Yeah, we just, oh, I've had federal agents call my house.  This gets good.  Oh, my God.  So now, so now, 1130 at night, 1130 at night, my door knocks.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  Like, what the fuck?  Over the door, it's the cops.  The guy's got this face like, I am so sorry. 
[02:29:30]  What the fuck?  I said, what's the matter?  His wife is so scared because of his menacing.  He, he, we watch him.  In the middle of the night, he'd go knock on the window and just stand outside the window.  Like, I said, like Cape Fear.  Lunatic.  Lunatic.  Just to control.  He's sick control freak.  Never touched her, but he's sick control.  He wants to control you.  Mind control.  Mind control.  Jimmy, you know all about that secret society.  Next on my program, it's Jim's neighbor, the pizza man. 
[02:30:00]  Now, pizza man, this is a conspiracy.  Well, this is what the cops say.  You can't make this shit up.  And the cop goes, Jim, I, I, we apologize.  Um, Lieutenant said, I have to come here because he legally called.  I have to make sure his children are not being kidnapped.  Holy mother of fuck. 
[02:30:30]  But that's the moment I knew he was a bitch.  What a, what a little bitch.  Yeah.  To call the cops.  Did you, you, now you're a bitch.  You just, you just put your dress on and you pierced.  You're a bitch.  You're now officially, I'm going to send you some makeup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now he's like, I'm going to call the cops on you now.  So he sends the cops to my house to harass me and my family.  And so I go, you're kidding me, right? 
[02:31:00]  And he goes, he laughs.  He's like, no, I'm not kidding.  I go, you know, he's, I said, why don't you talk to his wife?  His wife is right here.  She's scared to go home.  And he's like, I don't need to come in.  He's like, I just want to let you know he called and legally I had to come here.  Next time we'll call on the phone.  I said, all right, now it's okay.  This, this better end right here.  This better end right here.  So what happens?  She's now going away.  The wife is going away.  Now, granted, he doesn't pay one bill. 
[02:31:30]  Now he's driving around a white Mercedes.  All over town.  He's, he's got like 10 cars.  He won't pay a bill for his kids or his wife.  Right, right, right.  He wants to put them in the gutter.  Now, all of a sudden, the wife gives us like, I'm going away.  He steals my freaking bills, which he does.  I see him go there and pick up his mail every day.  He's got a court order now that says he's not allowed to pick up the mail.  He's not allowed to go to the house without a police escort.  He breaks it every day.  He goes there, takes the mail, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:32:00]  He goes there.  So he asked my, she asked my wife, pick up the mail.  Four days later, freaking.  Hi, this is, uh, you know, Charlie from the federal.  Oh, no.  Mail tampering.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  And, uh, we have a, um, police report saying, uh, pizza man, uh, is, is saying that, you  know, your wife's a suspect of stealing mail.  I went, all right. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, Christ.  So the cops, again, you're a bitch.  You know, she's taking, you know, that's some bitch shit.  I'm sorry.  That's some bitch shit.  You're not even a man anymore.  You're a bitch.  You're a, you're a baby.  You got a vagina.  You'll disrespect him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Your fluid just goes, yeah.  You're in hell, bro.  He's in, you are fucking on fire pissed.  Beyond on fire pissed. 
[02:33:00]  I want to, I know exactly where he walks at night.  I know exactly who he's banging in town.  Everyone knows who he's banging in town.  Everyone knows everything about this jet.  This is what made me feel better, though.  I swear on my kids' lives, every human being I bump into.  Goes, let me tell you something about that pizza guy.  Everyone's got a story.  So when someone does eventually do something to him, he's not going to know who.  Because there's like, he's pissed off Mexicans. 
[02:33:30]  He's pissed off the community.  He's pissed off the, every imaginal person in town he's had a run in with.  And that made me go, all right, it's not just me.  It's not just you.  I feel better.  I feel better.  You know, a mistake you made, well, obviously, wrong place, wrong time, because you're pretty  close proximity.  Yes.  But also, getting involved in any way, shape, or form.  Helping.  With even helping.  Yes. 
[02:34:00]  You're too nice of a guy.  Correct.  Is what you did.  Correct.  And now look how that pays you off.  Look at how that pays me off.  With a federal, with a Fed coming to your door.  Fed coming to the door.  And to quote Scarface, look at you now, you stupid fuck.  Right, so, and now we got another, well, the cops called, and they're like, listen, we  already talked to the federal agent, we talked, I said, well, fuck that, I want him charged  for false police report.  He's not allowed to pick up mail, so he can't make, he can't make, this is, listen, they're 
[02:34:30]  like, listen, man, this guy's out of his mind, and to prove that he doesn't know is a whole  new, you know, bag of rocks.  We're dealing with a bag of rocks.  I said, all right, so now, about two weeks, about two weeks ago, I'm sitting in my house.  This still continues?  Holy.  Oh, dude.  What's the duration of this whole thing from beginning to now been so far?  End of August. 
[02:35:00]  From the end of August.  From the end of August, okay.  Actually, it was like the first week, September, is when, last week, August.  We got three more months to go here.  When it got really bad.  All right.  When it got.  He moved in a couple years ago.  Yeah.  Everything was great with this guy, until he started telling me what I need to do.  Right.  Don't tell me what I need to do, because you're banging everyone in town, and you're, and  your relationship's in the dumper.  It's not my problem.  Yeah.  I'll help you, I'll even take care of your kids, like, like, better than you take care  of them.  Apparently. 
[02:35:30]  See, his kid came over yesterday, like, my daddy bought me a private jet to go to Orlando.  Like, you're kidding me, right?  I said, oh, that's exciting.  He's like, yeah.  He's bringing my mama, and he's saying, you know, you're going to steal me.  Oh, huh.  Oh, that's nice talk.  That's great.  Your father's great.  He taught me how to shoot gun.  Oh.  Oh, that's a good dad.  It's a good, pizza man's a good class citizen.  Good class act, that guy, that pizza guy.  So, so you smooth things over with the federal agents.  Yeah, federal agents, no problem. 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  Car drives by my neighborhood, pulls in my neighbor's yard, pulls all the way in the backyard.  I, I know it's not pizza man's, I know it's not any of his guys that work for him.  I call up the wife.  I say, are you expecting someone today?  Someone just pulled in the neighborhood.  Who pulled in my neighborhood?  Call the police.  I said, it looks like a, it doesn't look like a menacing car.  Why don't I go check?  I'm on the phone with the wife.  I go, stay on the phone with me.  I walk back, no one's in the car.  And she has a barn in her backyard, a little barn, like a garage. 
[02:36:30]  And it's just, the door's shut, no one's back there.  It's a little odd.  So I'm like, what?  I go, let me give you the license plate, and then I'm going to call the police, because  I don't know where these people are.  While I'm talking to her, the barn door opens.  Two of his guys are there.  One's about six foot four.  The other one's about two foot five.  And, and the big guy goes, hey, how you doing?  I said, good, everything cool?  He goes, yeah, I'm just feeding the animals.  And he was. 
[02:37:00]  He had animals, he was feeding animals.  At least what I saw, because he was, he was hiding behind the door.  So I said, all right.  Oh, no.  So I tell the wife, I go, he's feeding animals.  They're feeding animals.  It's, it's very legit.  She's like, my animal, those animals must be gone.  He's feeding the animals.  I walk away.  I go to my house.  I watch them drive away.  I said, drive away, I wave.  I got no problem with them.  Ten minutes later.  Oh, no.  Jim, can you tell me what happened about, you know, it's a story.  Can you tell me what happened about ten minutes ago? 
[02:37:30]  What do you mean?  What happened?  I don't know.  What happened?  He goes, well, I need your side of the story.  What story?  What are you talking about?  What happened across the street?  Oh, I'm thinking the wife called the police.  Uh-huh.  I said, well, this car came in and you pulled the backyard.  I went there.  No one's there.  And I was on the phone with her the whole time.  And they said they were feeding animals.  And that was it.  That's what I, all right.  That's all we need to hear. 
[02:38:00]  I hear him in the background going, I want to hear fucking charge for trespassing.  He, he, he, he, he threatened my workers.  He threatened my workers.  He's a bitch.  Threatened.  He's up at the, he's up at the police department.  He wants you locked up so bad.  He wants me locked up.  Yeah.  What a, what a watcher.  So he's at the police department.  There's a police report.  It says, it's really funny.  In the police report, it says, even though we explain to pizza man over and over again,  there's no trespassing. 
[02:38:30]  There was no harassment, no threats.  He insisted that we arrest him.  And I mean, the lawyer are going to do some.  So as you do, he sends me a letter.  I wish I brought the letter today.  I, I forgot the letter on my counter.  It looks like a third grader wrote this.  It looks like a third grader wrote this.  I start showing everyone down.  I'm like, you want to see something funny?  Uh, not, can, can I legally say the lawyer's name that sent it to me?  I wouldn't say any names. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  I would say, all I'm going to say is the lawyer is obviously a guy that he went to.  He's like, can you, uh, can you, I'll give you two slices of pizza.  You write this letter and just say lawyer.  Dear Jim Brewer, I am going to sue you.  Yeah.  Uh, your lawyer's, your neighbor's lawyer, Frank.  Yeah.  And it's, I mumble through that one.  That was so funny.  Yeah.  And it's basically like, this is Rocco.  Um, um, you, my client, uh, pizza man.  Um, my client pizza man needs you to stop harassing his employees and you need to stay away from 
[02:39:30]  his children.  I understand there's a court order that says you're not allowed anywhere near his children  and you know that you are going to reap the consequences.  So today I, you know, I finally, I'm like, you know what?  Now I gotta, now I gotta call the lawyer.  And now you gotta fucking.  So now I call the guy.  And so we just launched our missile and it came today. 
[02:40:00]  Now I can legally read my letter, right?  Yeah.  I just wouldn't say his name.  I just don't say his name.  No, no.  I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say.  It's actually pizza man.  It says it on the, uh, no bag of rocks.  When we sent, when, dude, I'm telling you, I showed this around town.  Everyone, I showed it to a lawyer and the guy laughed and he went to say it.  I'm not a lawyer.  This is a jackass.  Yeah.  And so when we found out my lawyer, he goes, you know, he's listed under a real estate  guy. 
[02:40:30]  He goes, he's technically a lawyer.  He is a lawyer, but he's like a meatball, this guy.  So you would, you would enjoy this.  Cause these guys hand them with dad, like I certainly would.  Yeah.  So like just, this guy's a beast.  Yeah.  You got to be a real guy, a real lawyer.  Yeah.  So the real, even, even, I wish I had the wording, the wording, the guy that's a part  time lawyer, he is such a good lawyer. 
[02:41:00]  I give him a tomato sauce.  When you have barn animals, honey, baby, it's hard to convince me that you're feeding them.  I love that term for a good lawyer to a beast.  It's a beast.  So here's where we're at in the battle royale.  And you know what?  At the end of the day, I wanted nothing to do with this.  Right.  And this jackass just keeps pulling me in.  You got forced into this whole situation.  I got forced into this.  Yes.  So here, I'll read the letter. 
[02:41:30]  Ready?  Here we go.  Dear Mr. Jerkoff.  We represent Jim Brewer and are responding to your letter, whatever the date.  We're unclear of your intentions in sending the letter and do not fully comprehend the  ambiguous threats contained therein.  In order to insist us in advising our client, please provide us with copies of any court  orders served upon Mr. Brewer, which in any way purpert, I don't even know what that 
[02:42:00]  word is, purport, purport.  I think maybe further the cause of or further the thought of, that's just a guess.  Thank you, Jim.  I could be totally wrong.  No, I think you're right.  Purport.  But if they show.  Yes.  Correct.  That purport to restrict his activities.  While your client appears to be going through a difficult divorce, I'm unaware of my, of  any orders, orances, or restrictions upon Mr. Brewer's constitutional right to associate 
[02:42:30]  with anyone, including his neighbor, your wife, which I won't say the name, which I know  right now is blood is boiling.  Pizza woman.  While Mr. Brewer would rather not be drawn into the marital hostilities, your client's apparent  paranoia and actions including verbal and physical threats, trespassing, spying, and 
[02:43:00]  assaulting behavior have required frequent police intervention and cause great concern with  the Brewer family.  Unless the court orders cure my ignorance of any applicable fees, we see no choice but  to retain local counsel in order to obtain injunctive relief against Mr. Pizza Man, continuing  harassment and threats towards Mr. Brewer.  What does injunctive relief mean? 
[02:43:30]  It's not good.  It's, it's basically, it says, this is, this is the street wise, one more fucking letter  with this, if you fucking threaten my guy one more time, in the fucking oven you go.  Okay.  In the oven you go.  In the oven.  You hear me?  One more phone call, one more, in the oven you go.  So that was to his lawyer.  That's his lawyer.  And to him.  Good.  Because the lawyer will understand, even if he's not a legit lawyer, or a good lawyer,  a real estate lawyer.  He'll understand the awful implications of this.  Oh yeah.  He's going to try to sell you a mortgage. 
[02:44:00]  And my lawyer, my lawyer actually tried to, he's like, Jim, do you really want to pursue  this?  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah.  Because it doesn't end here.  Now you're pissed.  Yeah.  It doesn't end, it's not going to end here.  No.  You know, it's going to be one day where I'm playing in the yard and this kid touches my,  you know, my grass and I got to worry about this fucking wacko doing something stupid.  No.  I want him, everything I could do, full blown assault.  Done.  You have to set up a barrier of protection around yourself.  I've had enough.  But however, if you love to have his pizza, search him in town, I'm sure you would love 
[02:44:30]  it.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  It's a good pizza, huh?  It's not New York pizza.  It's not Giuseppe's pizza.  It's not Roma's pizza.  It's not, let's see, Roma, New York pizza, Napoli.  It's not Napoli.  Uh, not Giuseppe's.  Mm-hmm.  But if there's another pizza place somewhere around, which was, I believe, voted, like,  number one, this is. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  Yeah, voted number one in the county.  By his best friend that he paid off.  So, yeah, that's the world I've been in.  That's a great story.  And while I'm doing that, I bring my dad to get some relief.  Yeah.  Who's 86.  I bring him to the, like, let me get my dad out.  A little family time.  You know, I'm sitting there in 15 minutes.  These guys come over to talk to my dad.  And they're like, yeah, I got a World War II hat on.  And blah, blah, blah.  We want to take you out.  And da, da, da.  And, you know, where I've been? 
[02:45:30]  I've been here.  Blah, blah.  And they're like, yeah, we want to take you to Atlantic City.  Get something good to eat.  What do you like eating?  Cont.  Oh.  He said that?  Yeah, the lady behind.  That is it.  Wait, you got the name?  That is it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is it.  Somebody had it.  Yeah.  A few people had it.  Somebody popped it right up on the board there.  So feel free to go there and have great conversation with him.  To know that.  And ask him, like, hey, how's it going with the bills and your new private jet that you're  burying your children with? 
[02:46:00]  Isn't he a nice class act citizen, this guy?  Yeah, that's great.  That is a great story, man.  Dr. Steve, by the way, this guy knows everything.  Injunctive relief.  Gaining satisfaction through legal means, i.e. by injunction, which is kind of what we  said.  Thank you, Steve.  So anyway, all that leads to I'm playing Albany.  Oh.  Got to pay those lawyers.  Oh, you're playing the...  Well, I feel better.  I feel like I went to therapy.  That's awesome.  The Hart Theater at the Egg in Albany, December... 
[02:46:30]  Tomorrow and Saturday.  Oh, tomorrow's Friday already?  Oh, my God.  How the fuck did that happen?  It's www.theegg.org.  And Saturday the 5th...  I'm not...  Yeah, yeah.  Is that wrong?  No, that's right.  But for some reason, my web...  Yeah, all right.  That's right, Jeff.  Well, how come the same date...  No, that's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Doing a double?  What?  What?  What?  You're doing two of them on the same day?  Yeah, no, that's wrong.  Egg is Friday.  Tarrytown is Saturday.  Okay.  Oh, the Egg is one show on Friday night.  Tarrytown is Saturday at the Tarrytown Music Hall, and Friday the 11th... 
[02:47:00]  Oh, I was just there.  The Wilbur Theater in Boston.  You sell well there.  I do very well in Boston.  You do really good there.  They have liquor now, so Blumenreich finally got his liquor license.  He fought for it.  You know what?  Blumenreich fought, and he was patient.  So anyone that's gone...  Did you ever hear the story?  He was cock.  Yes.  And I said, oh my God.  Yes, here's a liquor license.  Here's your liquor license for that big, delicious gift, if we may.  But one of the best venues around is the Wilbur Theater in Boston. 
[02:47:30]  What's the story?  The story goes...  Someone told me this.  Someone...  Someone goes...  Supposedly, Bill, the guy who runs the Comedy Connection, he pissed off...  The story has it.  Back in the days of Irish Mafia, there's like an Irish family that runs...  Runs...  Corned Beef and Cabbage Guy?  Can we call you that?  Just call him Liver Guy.  Corned Beef and Cabbage Guy. 
[02:48:00]  Nice.  Okay.  Runs most of Boston.  Now, Bill comes along, pisses off Corned Beef and Cabbage Guy.  Right.  Now, 20-something years later, Bill goes to Corned Beef and Cabbage Guy thinking, eh, it's  all under the bridge now.  Now, he buys or he takes as a lease, like a big, long, 20-year lease from the Corned Beef  and Cabbage Guy, the Wilbur Theater.  Now, with that, so he redecorates the place and his... 
[02:48:30]  First, it's like...  See where this is going.  Yeah.  First, it's like...  He puts these new seats in.  He goes to get his liquor license and they're like, eh, we're having trouble getting a liquor  license.  That's a little tougher than we anticipate.  We're going to have to wait another four months.  But my big opening, eh, two weeks before the opening, eh, we got a problem.  Apparently, this is a historical site and you're putting new seats in. 
[02:49:00]  Can't do that.  You're going to have to rip them all out, put the old ones in.  I mean, it was one thing.  It just busted.  What?  How are you, Bill?  Listen, I know you have your big grand opening and you've got little Jimmy Norton coming  up there.  But we have a little problem.  You're only going to be allowed to serve Twix.  And it's going to be standing room only. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, he got Bill Good.  That's fantastic.  Did he fuck him?  Oh, he fucked him for like a year straight.  Oh, that's going to cost you another 50 grand.  Sorry.  A little payback from 20 years ago.  Sorry.  Nice.  Compliments from Ant Casey.  They can hold a grudge.  Oh, yeah.  Who is funnier than fucking Jim Brewer, man?  Brewer fucking.  You guys are.  Jim, you are a funny fucking guy. 
[02:50:00]  You don't understand what you just did.  Holy shit, dude.  We can now leave early for the next like three years.  Yeah, we got new Jim Brewer material.  We got a new Jim Brewer bit.  Where we can sneak out early.  Where we can leave early.  Brewer, I can't tell.  I can't tell the story.  Literally, if I had made it out of the 91st floor on 9-11, nobody would want to hear  my story.  Brewer is amazing.  That was an hour.  I am in awe.  Dude, you could tell.  When we did it with the Colin Quint show when Jim was the fucking guest, we just sat there 
[02:50:30]  like a bunch of little girls and listened to him tell stories.  You're the fucking best storyteller I've ever had.  Louis C.K. is right behind you.  But I would say you're even better than Louis.  You're the best storyteller ever.  That's a compliment.  Very compelling.  That's a biggie.  Holy shit.  Absolutely.  That was an hour.  It's Long Island.  It's a great radio.  It is.  It's Long Island Street corner talking.  It's all amazing.  I'm mad at that shit.  You're right.  You got your coat on?  You're leaving us?  No, this is where I hang.  It's a bulletproof vest.  We got to take a break.  Take leagues.  Get coffee. 
[02:51:00]  All that shit.  And Jimmy's playing Caroline starting tonight, right, Jimmy?  Tonight through Sunday, I promise to give away tickets for any show but the first show  Saturday.  I'll give away two pairs of tickets.  Just call in if you live in New York and ask for whichever show you want.  We'll get you a pair of tickets.  Yeah, we'll give it to a random caller.  Yeah, the first two callers.  The first two callers.  First two?  All right.  That's why we do that.  All right.  Brewer's going to hang with us for the rest of the show.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:51:30]  Check it out, The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Our old pal Jim Brewer's in studio.  Hilarious, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm glad you guys think it's funny.  You gave us an hour off right there.  I just saved myself a hundred bucks from going to therapy.  Yeah, right?  It really is like fucking just vomiting, right?  It really is.  And just even talking to you, Jimbo, it's like, you know, he's just trying to set up  a trap to rile you up and come in there. 
[02:52:00]  Because right now, you got him, but you do something dumb and it turns around fast.  I would never, ever, ever do something dumb.  Ever.  Even, like, just going there to yell at him is like, you won.  You won, man.  Stay away.  It's over.  The show's over.  Let him send us the next dumb.  I can't wait to see the movie because that's a great movie, man.  Whenever you get a letter with an injunctive relief in it, you're like, fuck.  Fuck.  How do I deal with this?  Yeah, this lawyer's got to fucking Google him. 
[02:52:30]  Don't give a relief.  Right.  Horrible.  Legal term, that is.  That just sucks.  How's your gig?  You're doing the Stress Factory, too.  I know we were plugging that.  I'm going to do it next week or something.  Tuesday night or something, right?  Are you doing, like, Monday or Tuesday?  Are you doing, like, a weeknight?  Yeah, I'm going to do a weeknight.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  You know, invite all the friends and all that.  Oh, okay.  You know, the daughter has, like, all these gymnastic, like, hey, can we ever come to a show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the worst when people want to come, because then you have to do material that they're  going to enjoy.  Like, I hate when people want to come see me at the cellar. 
[02:53:00]  It's like, I want to work on material.  Yeah, not the cellar.  I don't want the pressure of being...  Yeah, that's the place where you work out your shit.  Yeah.  Hey, Ozzy's birthday, Jimmy.  Come on.  I didn't know.  What do you got for Ozzy?  61 today.  I didn't bother him.  I'm the fan of Jim.  You're like Norton or Ozzy.  This fucking guy, he's the best common character.  I would be happy once if he just walked in one time and remembered that he had met me  before.  I am of no consequence to Ozzy Osbourne. 
[02:53:30]  Did he meet you?  Many times.  Oh, yeah.  So he knows you?  I don't know.  Jimmy, you're tight these days.  I know Sharon.  E-mail stuff.  I was invited to attribute him.  There was only a form of...  Oh, you want to hear something that Norton did for a while?  No, no, no, no.  What?  Yeah, yeah, I want to hear it.  You haven't seen Brewer in a while?  No, you don't.  Yes, I like the rock stuff.  Mark, we haven't seen Brewer in a while.  Can I at least explain what it is?  Well, you can explain it afterwards.  Oh, no.  He has to.  No, no, no.  Why don't we just play it and then Norton can explain it?  Is it a faggy story?  I'll swap faggy stories with you.  Right now, I'd be prouder if they were...  This is Jim blowing a bunch of people. 
[02:54:00]  I'd be prouder if they were playing that.  Just listen to this.  Dude, I've got these stories.  Don't worry about it.  Listen to this and then we'll trade faggy stories.  All right.  This is great.  This is what Norton did for Ozzy, which I think is wonderful.  Are you ready?  They were great.  Come on, you motherfuckers.  It's been a Barry Manilow concert.  Are you ready?  Hey, who is it?  I got red, Jimmy.  Let me hear you make some noise.  Ozzy!  That was Jimmy's little dream come true. 
[02:54:30]  He got to actually intro Ozzy.  I want to make sure that they were at the right concert.  We can all understand that.  He got to intro Ozzy Osbourne, which is a childhood dream.  But he did more than that.  He informed the people.  He let the people know that it indeed was not a Barry Manilow concert.  I just should have named a better band.  I'm not a good yeller.  Where was this?  I'm not a good yeller.  That was in L.A.  That was at the Sunset Music Festival because I was invited to tribute.  There was like four of us that got invited to tribute him. 
[02:55:00]  It was myself, Billy Bob.  Thornton.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Slash and one other person.  Henry Ronald.  So I was one of the people I invited to tribute him.  Sharon asked.  So the next night she invites me.  Her and Ozzy called me in my hotel room.  Come on.  I have fucking her and Ozzy there and I'm chatting with them and she invites me to the show.  And when I'm there, she goes, would you like to bring Ozzy on?  There's no interest because it was out in the middle of the street.  So I was like, yeah.  But any showbiz experience I ever had, anything that ever made me cool, I literally was 14 years old and had never talked to an audience before in my life. 
[02:55:30]  Dude, let me tell you something.  It's a VH1 rock honors and they said, we'd like to be part of it only if I get to introduce Judas Priest.  I brought it back to my basement.  I had a denim jacket painted with Priest on the back.  I started practicing all the screams.  And so when I went out there, and I don't care.  I really don't care.  As a matter of fact, I'm sure everyone poked fun at me because I went out there. 
[02:56:00]  And I'm like, are you ready for the metal?  And I'm trying to scream as if to look to Halford like, you know, I just want to let you know I'm on your tail.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anything happens to you, I'm in.  I'm in.  I just want to let you know.  So I'm expecting it.  So not only that.  I'm going to run you out of the band.  Now, you've been to these events where I'm sure you didn't go in the crowd.  I'm sure you stayed on the stage.  Yes.  Like that's what celebrities do. 
[02:56:30]  When Priest was playing, no, what do I do?  Everyone's standing there watching on the side and, you know, Kiss is there, whoever's there.  I went into the audience and started my own little air guitar thing with like three or four fans.  And I had a messed up neck for it.  And I started people looking at me like, really?  Jim Brewer, you're fucking air guitaring to breaking the law next to a 14-year-old?  It is amazing, though, how anything you've learned when you're around idols, any cool you've learned in the business, gone. 
[02:57:00]  Out the woods, immediately.  Out the fucking woods, gone.  Did you ever hear when I first met, first time I ever met Piazza?  Huge psycho, huge psycho Met fan.  I get to throw out, I get to throw out the first pitch.  So, I get, we got a bus, so I'm juiced up out of my mind.  It's my birthday.  I'm walking out now.  At the time, I already met Lars.  And Lars is like, dude, I'm pretty fucking sure that my Piazza is a big fucking fan. 
[02:57:30]  So, in my mind, I'm like, I'm going to connect with Piazza.  So, you throw out the pitch, and then you go and you collect the ball, and you have an exchange.  So, I'll never forget the whole time, I'm like, what am I going to say to my Piazza?  Well, he's going to remember Jim Brewer forever.  So, I go walk up, I go walk him up to him, and I go, Lars Ulrich says hello, man. 
[02:58:00]  And he just, like, gave me the ball and looked at me, like, what was that?  What the fuck?  And then he, I saw him years later, funny, at a Priest concert.  Was you there?  No.  Was you at the Eddie Trunk thing?  Oh, yeah, yeah, backstage.  It was, uh, it wasn't Priest, it was, uh...  No, it was at the Priest one.  Okay, no.  When they played, like, Hard Rock or something like that.  Somebody introduced me to Mike backstage at the Hard Rock.  I was there with you, Jimmy.  Mike could have been nicer, man.  I could have sworn those guys were there. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, and Black Sabbath was supposed to come.  I was back.  I'm pretty sure.  Wait a minute.  I could have sworn I saw, like, Florentine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was the night.  I didn't remember that was Priest.  I thought it was Motley Crue.  Yeah, Motley Crue was there one night.  This was a different night.  Doesn't matter.  Okay.  And I saw...  Oh, it was Priest, I'm sorry.  Yes, I remember how, for, it was the first time I saw, yeah, Eddie, Eddie Trunk, it  was the 25th anniversary of the song.  Yes, yes, yes.  Eddie, the metal, yes.  Yes.  This is a great song, come from the British Steel, which was weird, he didn't have his 
[02:59:00]  leather on, he just had, like, California shorts on, and I remember seeing Piazza, I'm  like, do you remember that night?  He's like, yeah.  That was the most awkward thing anyone's ever told me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  But we lose our minds when certain circumstances, certain guys like that, it's...  There's no such thing.  I couldn't do it cool.  I didn't even think about being cool.  I wasn't worried.  I was just...  No, you're a fan. 
[02:59:30]  It's fucking a bitch.  I was a bitch.  And happy to be so.  Why not?  But you have to hear it after and you're like, oh, boy.  You want to hear it again, Jimmy?  No, no.  I've heard it a lot of times.  It's not my outgoing answer.  Are you sure, though?  You all right?  Are you ready?  They were great, though.  Come on, you motherfuckers.  You're sitting at Barry Matherwell concert.  Are you ready?  Go for Jim.  Go for Jim Norton.  Go, Jim.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[03:00:00]  Let's see you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, why do you feel so compelled to just yell?  Because the crowd, if you can hear it on the iPhone recording I have, you should hear  how loud it was from the state.  It's like, you really do feel like you have to yell.  You have to yell.  Do you think it's one of those situations like, then we're going to take a leg of Washington  and then it's Washington, D.C.  I don't know.  You just don't hear yourself. 
[03:00:30]  As comedians, you're not used to yelling over that kind of fucking noise.  Hold on.  I think I may even have the iPhone version.  I don't know where it is.  Oh.  And you're a little out of your element, so you're trying to be accepted by that crowd.  Even though you know they kind of know you?  Dude, we have some incredibly douchey stage moments.  Hold on.  Thank God they're not recorded.  Let me see.  Where is it?  That's Ozzy talking. 
[03:01:00]  That's Ozzy.  They're telling me to go out there?  Go.  Go.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I had to follow Ozzy yelling.  Oh, yeah.  He can't hear it.  Oh, I heard an environmental concert. 
[03:01:30]  But listen to them.  I can't listen to the rest.  But you really...  You can't hear...  I couldn't hear myself talking.  They were fucking screaming so loud.  Yeah.  This is a great time.  Fucking Jim Norton's here.  He's going to blow it out of the fucking water, Saren.  He actually...  I was backstage talking to her.  Yeah.  And all the people that ignored me before, because she was talking to me a lot, were very  nice to me. 
[03:02:00]  And it was great, because he walked by.  And she goes, look who's here.  And he walked over.  And he slapped my face.  I was very happy.  What's going on, Jim?  He probably didn't recognize me.  He just probably wanted to slap me.  Saren, this little Jimmy.  You know him.  Who the fuck is him?  Why is this guy here?  He just keeps looking at me.  That's freaking awesome.  Yeah.  Well, happy birthday to us.  61.  Yeah.  Fucking 60.  61 years young.  I should say, the funniest thing was the reality show when he...  Which really was the first real reality show. 
[03:02:30]  Absolutely.  Shit, it was never a take two.  Bullshit.  It was never a take two.  I mean, they really did...  That was the original great reality show.  And that one...  There were two ones that were hilarious.  The one he goes...  She's going, you're going to play...  I forgot what city it was.  Like, Cleveland.  She's like, you're going to do Cleveland.  And he's going, I can't do it, Sharon.  I'm too fucking old.  And I'm not fucking playing Cleveland.  And he's like, Ozzy, you go from here to there.  He's like, I'm not fucking doing it. 
[03:03:00]  And that's that.  Cut to...  What's up, Cleveland?  I'm like, this is the greatest show ever.  Ever.  She is apparently very...  Like, she...  Because I've never had anything but nice interactions with her.  She's been so sweet.  I'm dying to meet her.  You know that, Sharon?  Well, that's an easy...  If you love Ozzy, she loves you.  But, man, I heard if you're on the wrong end of her, she is a motherfucker.  They're terrified of her. 
[03:03:30]  Everyone's terrified of her.  And I've never seen anything but a nice...  But that's what I like about her.  Because that's...  At the end of the day, that's her husband.  Yep.  Hey, it's not Ozzy and her...  That's her husband.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I love that stuff.  I love when someone's vicious like that.  She's fucking...  Did you say something about my husband?  She's great.  We got her in trouble because she was here and she was talking about Susan Boyle.  Oh, God.  Did she punch her or something?  Is that the...  No, she might as well have...  Oh, man.  I mean...  Punched her pride.  The listeners have heard it, but you got to see this. 
[03:04:00]  Get the Sharon Osbourne.  She went after Susan Boyle.  She was just being very honest.  Susan Boyle.  I don't know if she's...  Oh, she's that singer.  She's a...  She was on Britain's Got Talent.  She's a...  Nuff said.  Nuff said.  Big, fat, ugly lady.  Nuff said.  She's got talent.  Done.  She's a good singer, but she's homely.  Okay.  She's remarkable.  Oh, the curly hair?  Yeah, that mess.  Yes, Gene Stapleton.  Yeah, that one.  That's okay.  Okay.  Yeah, further down.  Right there.  There you go.  This was classic. 
[03:04:30]  This great picture of Susan Boyle smiling, looking like a slapdash.  Right there.  Slapdash.  That really is a great shot.  What a great line.  That's a great line.  Do you love Susan Boyle?  I mean, do you know she helped the show or not, or do you not love her?  Do you happy that she's succeeding?  Oh, I'm happy that she...  I like everybody to do well.  Yeah.  Even someone that looks like a slapdash.  It's like, God bless her. 
[03:05:00]  She's a girl girl.  She does it like a hairy arse.  I don't know why they tried to clean her up.  I mean, perhaps she was.  That is fantastic.  It's kind of hard to spin that.  What did you mean that you said she was a hairy asshole face?  It was a spiritual comment.  I didn't mean it to be taken in a bad way.  And she is a lovely...  I would hope so.  Followed by God bless her.  You just want to say, go bless, and here's a Gillette razor. 
[03:05:30]  I never noticed that she had facial hair.  Oh, my God.  She's fuzzy.  I can't get past the slapdash.  I couldn't get past the fucking G. Wilder wig.  Oh, shit.  God bless her heart.  God bless her.  But we love her.  But she's terrific.  God doesn't give everyone everything. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  But he gave her the challenge.  Yes, yes.  Yes, he did.  Really short-changing on the rest of it.  She's a fucking ugly bitch.  Who's the long-haired dude?  Brett Michaels.  That's what I thought it was.  Yeah, she's having a ball.  Brett does our show.  He's a great guest.  He's a lot of fun.  She's attractive.  She fucking...  For 61 or 60 years old, she looks good.  She's had work.  She's what?  She's as old as Ozzy, I guess?  Maybe she's in her late 50s.  I could be wrong.  I'm just saying they're in the same range.  Yeah, sure, sure, sure.  Actually, she might be younger. 
[03:06:30]  She might be 55.  I'm not sure.  She had a lot of work done, but I mean...  Yeah.  Did you meet...  Well, yeah, obviously you met Kelly then.  Yeah, the only one I haven't met is Jack.  I've only met Kelly once, and that was when we interviewed her in 2001, right after Sharon  and now she had cancer.  It was in 2002, I think.  Right.  So don't ask her about that.  Yep.  But I don't think Sharon would like me, because I only...  I got to talk to Kelly for a very brief moment, and she said, you know, do you remember  the episode where, on the Osbournes, where Jack, where she was going, I don't want you 
[03:07:00]  watching that stuff.  It was half-baked.  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  Yes.  She probably loved her.  So he was going through something, and she's like, she really did not like that film in  her home.  Oh, it's just because it was the drugs, and he was younger.  She probably loved you.  She wouldn't care.  That sucks.  I was like, I'm out.  Yeah.  No.  Not at all.  She's 57 years old.  57.  Yeah, she looks great for 57.  Absolutely.  She looks phenomenal.  Yeah.  What else is going on?  We did a lot of shit today, man.  Did a lot of fucking shit. 
[03:07:30]  I don't think we missed...  Oh, we got the misquote in the Daily News, and they said Richard Huff is going to...  Oh, are we getting him on the phone?  Don't know.  I mean, I had to go do...  Can we try to get Richard Huff on the phone?  And Tiger's...  I know Brewer doesn't do a lot of current events on his show, but Tiger's mistress,  you know, the one that lawyered up?  Yeah.  She lied for Tiger.  She was the reason that they started fighting, because they were texting back and forth.  And then Tiger's wife goes, who are you texting?  Grabbed the phone.  Of course.  Read the text, and then called her.  And during the yelling and screaming between the two, the phone ended up breaking. 
[03:08:00]  And one of the reasons why Tiger won't let the cops into the houses, all the latest info,  we're told there was damage as a result of the altercation in the vestibule area of Tiger's home.  Damage that cannot be easily repaired, and that is why Tiger would not let police come in.  I wonder...  Okay, I wonder if...  They're having a press conference at 1130.  She's the first one that came out and said, no, no, no, it's all lies.  Then she wound up this Rachel girl.  Jesus Christ.  He was texting with his wife there. 
[03:08:30]  It's done.  She ain't going to leave him, though.  They said he could...  Drudge said he could lose $300 million in a divorce.  He's a billionaire.  In a bag of shells.  He's a billionaire.  That's a snot riot.  He's a go.  That's not riot.  Dripping booze on the curb.  Well, they have a prenup for $60 million, but it doesn't matter.  When there's kids involved, the fucking...  You know, I don't think prenup will cover the kids.  This is Paul McCartney territory.  Yeah, that's not funny.  Well, he didn't have one.  He didn't have one.  He just knocked her up and said, yeah, whatever you want.  What a fucking dumbbell he is. 
[03:09:00]  What a monumental dumbbell.  Oh, let it be.  Let it be.  She's going to have to let it be.  Yeah.  What a fucking fool.  Can you imagine?  How long have they married?  Four years.  Four years.  Four years.  Here's $50 billion.  Jesus.  You think she was really going to stay, huh?  I don't know.  I mean, she must have been a great fuck wrapping that leg around him.  I mean, she must have...  No, I meant the tiger thing.  Oh, yes, I do.  I think it'll do as to be a cop on her.  I don't know.  Depends on how much more comes out.  He's the greatest golfer on earth. 
[03:09:30]  She's going to stay.  Unless there's stuff that we don't know about.  Unless you take the whole, okay, well, now, it's the whole, all right, let me take my  shirt off.  You may be the greatest golfer, but now it's time to exploit all your extra activities here  and paint you as an asshole because all anyone knows him as is the smiley Wheaties, you know,  pfft, pfft, pfft, there's Tiger.  That's all you know him.  So she's, who knows what's going...  You piss off a model that's a mom to your children, and who knows what kind of anger 
[03:10:00]  is going to come out of that.  That's true, and she is probably humiliated.  Humiliated.  Now you can see, dude, it's on a level of family, like, you let him exploit you like  that.  Yeah, how do you have family get-togethers after that?  It's right.  It's easier.  It's done.  It's going to be her, it's going to be her family just giving everybody shit.  Right.  And the golfer that...  I told you not to marry a fucking...  You know what I'm saying. 
[03:10:30]  So she's going to be dealing with that shit in her ear.  And then the guy...  In her ear?  Oh.  A fellow golfer that introduced Alon, is her name right?  Alon to Tiger?  Yeah.  It's his motherfucking Tiger Woods now.  And they used to be pals.  They used to be pals.  Listen.  But he's like, look, man, now I'm embarrassed they ever fucking introduced him and all this  shit.  You understand?  I'm just saying what he said.  Well, this just...  Let's say we all hang out together and Jimmy's beyond a rock star, but we're all like, you 
[03:11:00]  know, he's kind of a...  This guy's a real fucking asshole.  He's the pizza man.  So the minute the pizza man is knocked down, now we all get to go, ah, let me get a kick.  It's just...  Let me go.  Get out of the way.  It's the doors are wide.  You're going to see other golfers going, you know, I didn't want to say nothing, but now  it's my time.  Jack Nicklaus, eh, I told you I was the best.  Now, who knows?  Good point. 
[03:11:30]  It's just...  That's never going to end now.  Should have never allowed him higher Bushwood.  We said, once you let one of them in, Dr. Beeper and I didn't want him in.  She'll stay.  He'll do a mea culpa.  He'll apologize to her.  He's just a guy who was fucking some chicks.  It's not like he was...  He just fucked a few chicks.  I'm telling you.  But now he lost all the women.  Now the people that have to be associated with him. 
[03:12:00]  Like, you like Tiger Woods.  Every...  Dude, I mean, everyday marriage guy is somewhere in Iowa right now.  It's like, turn off that Tiger Woods.  After what he did to his wife and his children, you are not watching him.  Yep.  What do you like about...  He's a great golfer.  I don't give a shit what he's great at.  He's a fucking beast to his family.  Click.  George, can I come over the house?  I can't...  You can't watch Tiger Woods now.  Because your wife is harassing you.  I say she leaves.  I don't know, man. 
[03:12:30]  Because I don't even think all the info is out yet.  Maybe not.  I think this gets definitely uglier before it gets better.  The ugliest man on earth is on Maury, by the way.  What a horribly ugly...  He looks like Florentine with Down syndrome.  Look at who is that guy.  He's horrendous.  He says, he's a married man paying for sex on Maury.  Okay, so I stand corrected.  I like him.  There you go.  I don't think she's going to leave.  Unless something comes out that's a bombshell.  If it's only two or three broads, he was banging.  Oh, goodness.  Look what he's buying, though.  I know. 
[03:13:00]  I like that big fat ass.  Oh, Christ.  He's buying a mess.  That is a mess.  Big ass prostitute.  It is a mess.  Looks like fucking James Gumm.  The golfer was Parnovic.  Thank you.  But he's the one that she worked as his nanny.  With her sister.  Yeah.  There was two of them.  I think they're twin sisters, right?  Used to work for Parnovic.  It's over.  As a nanny.  And then Tiger goes, hey, you should say hi to my nanny.  The rest is history.  I say it's way over.  The press conference is at 1130, and I think it's going to be a really good one. 
[03:13:30]  Because now this broad has to say more stuff than the other broad said.  Yeah, you're right.  Or who gives a shit.  I think it's going to be just like steroids.  I told these guys before the show, I'm like, she comes out and says that she stuck a golf club in Tiger's hiney.  Something really dirty.  That would be great.  That would be great.  Let me show you.  Wait.  You're going to have to phase this out.  But let me take my shirt off.  And she's going to have, like, red marks of where he clumped her.  Me, a fucking teeth prince. 
[03:14:00]  Who's that fucking sports guy?  Marv.  Marv Albert.  Naughty boy.  Naughty, naughty Marv.  Dirty Marv.  I love Marv Albert.  Yeah, Marv was a class act, man.  But yeah, I say she ain't leaving.  But I'm usually wrong about this type of stuff.  I really am pop culture.  I say she's staying.  The reason she leaves is because of what Brewer was saying.  I mean, it's going to be all the people in her year and her family.  I don't know how big her family is.  Superstar athlete.  I'm telling you.  She's going to walk away with plenty of money.  Jordan's wife.  Did she leave? 
[03:14:30]  Didn't something come out about him?  I don't remember.  They're divorced.  Kobe's wife stayed.  Well, she's a dummy.  But I'm saying a lot of them stay, man.  An allegation of an athlete on that level fucking a couple of chicks.  Unless there was something so dirty we don't know it.  I think most of those women might hate it but are somewhat prepared for it.  He's got to come out with some I'm addicted to sex nonsense.  Who said that?  To go to rehab.  Ian Halpern?  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, he's got to go to David Duchovny.  Duchovny.  He has to. 
[03:15:00]  Duchovny's wife stayed, I think.  Didn't Michael Douglas' wife, as long as they fucking, you know, sign something saying  they weren't going to, you know, she'll give it another chance.  Unless she's gotten caught before and we didn't know it.  I'm babbling.  Right.  I think she's had it, man.  She was chasing him with that golf club, I think.  The visuals.  The visuals.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's just like that Kinnison bit.  You know, I didn't hear the part.  You know, two weeks later, it's like, so, um, you know, that girl, it's your fucker.  It's your fucker.  It's your fucker.  It's your fucker. 
[03:15:30]  It's your fucker.  That's going to be nonstop for the next couple of years.  Oh, my God.  And there's no golf tours anytime soon.  This is the end of the season.  Yeah, so he's got to be home.  He's got to be home for a good two, three months.  That happens to, yeah, a few guys where it's like, you just think, God, they stayed with  him.  Like, is Spitzer still with his wife?  Spitzer's wife stayed.  Hillary stayed.  I'm telling you, there's something about a man as powerful as he is.  He is arguably the best golfer ever. 
[03:16:00]  She's not fucking leaving a guy of that iconic status.  McGreevy's wife didn't stay.  That's a good point.  But that's because his breath was bleaching.  But she knew Ajax by McGreevy.  But you're saying she's just a dummy then, right?  No, I'm saying that what attracts someone like her to someone like him, a beautiful knockout  to a guy who's good looking, is the fact it's the power of who he is.  But she could get another powerful guy that might treat her better.  Not like that.  You know who else stayed? 
[03:16:30]  Fucking Kathy Lee stayed with Frank Gifford after that heinie sex fucking episode in the  hotel room.  And that was a situation where, oh, you knew that motherfucker wasn't getting out of her  sight for a second.  A guy would dump a woman for fucking like that?  I think a woman is more likely to dump a guy if he's fallen in love with somebody else.  But just for fucking, I think they're more likely to tolerate it.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.  A guy would dump her in a second because you can't have your friends looking at her.  It's a falling in love thing, Jimbo.  As long as it's just a little bit of sex, you'll have to hear shit.  Because then they'll think like, I hate to piss off any girls, but they may think like, 
[03:17:00]  you know, maybe, you know, I was, maybe I started getting boring and he did try to  do some things and I denied him.  Yeah, the kids were always crying.  The kids were always crying.  I guess I...  You know, I take care of this house.  Sorry, honey.  That's why I didn't, I didn't want to buy, I want to harass you.  Yeah, I know you're busy.  I didn't want to harass you.  You're tired, so I put my dick in that.  I didn't want to bother you.  Right.  I knew you were tired, yeah.  You guys want to know how much Jordan's divorce cost him? 
[03:17:30]  A lot.  You want to guess?  How much?  It's not rocking.  Sarah from Buffalo's got the number.  $30,000.  No, no, no, a lot more.  It's not rocking money.  What do you think?  I'm going to say $300 million.  That's $168 million is the answer.  Oh, wow.  It's not rocking.  The all-time most costly celebrity divorce back in 2006.  Phil Collins has had some fucking high ones.  What does he do to women?  Phil Collins?  Oh, yeah.  Had a couple?  Yeah.  Hasn't he?  Hasn't he had like two or three?  He can't drum anymore.  That's why he started working at Disney.  He started writing all the... 
[03:18:00]  I write all the songs.  He had to get some Disney money.  He had to get himself some Disney money.  I need some benefits.  I need some Disney money.  I can feel it coming in the air tonight.  That's mine now, you fuck.  Imagine that.  I've been waiting for...  You can't sing that anymore.  Mine.  Mine.  I own the rights to that one.  Thanks, bitch.  Great.  Unbelievable.  Sue, sue, sue, sue, sue.  I'll sue you if you play that fucking song again, you motherfucker.  Psching, psching, psching. 
[03:18:30]  Here, go buy some new shoes.  Go get something nice.  Hey, how did De Niro treat you?  I met De Niro one time.  He just blew me off for a picture, but he didn't want everybody to start asking him.  How was he when you did S&L with him?  He...  I'm very jealous of that.  First of all, he...  All right, well, this will make you feel better.  I didn't meet him at all up front before they came on the show.  Was that a real surprise they didn't tell you ahead of time?  The real surprise was the dress show. 
[03:19:00]  What happened was Pesci came on, and he said...  Which I was flipped out about.  And I told a story before where he scared the shit out of me.  He scared the shit out of me.  I thought I was going to have to pay him money for the rest of my career.  Because he met me on a Friday night.  He wanted to meet me Friday in the green room.  So I go in the green room, and he goes...  First thing he said, he said, you're going to thank me for giving you a career?  And I...  But he said it with such menace.  And then he went this whole thing about, are you Italian? 
[03:19:30]  You know, then why do you say Guinea and Wap and Dago when you're not even Italian?  Like, that don't bother you?  And he went this whole thing about his family, and you portray me as an animal.  I don't care what anyone says.  To this day, I think he was dead serious.  And I almost broke down, and I was like, I apologized.  And I said, I will forget the sketch.  I never...  This is how the things turned around. 
[03:20:00]  I said, Mr. Pesci, I watched Raging Bull.  And I said, this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life.  And I just started imitating you, because I'm a fan.  And I watched you in Easy Money.  And every film you ever did after that.  And I never meant any disrespect.  So forget the sketch.  That's not what I ever meant.  And I said, if you listen to the sketch, I never call an Italian a name.  The sketch goes...  I get pissed at the other guy going, what do you think?  I'm some kind of crazy guinea-ovian. 
[03:20:30]  What do you think I'm some kind of...  And he goes, yeah, I know what the sketch fucking said.  I know what the...  So I'm like, I just want you to know...  I said, so forget the sketch.  We'll never do it again.  He's like, what the fuck?  I mean, we're fucking here.  We're doing it.  We don't...  I'm busting your chops.  I'm busting your fucking...  I don't think he was busting my chops.  But this is the best part.  This is what you like.  He'll go.  He goes...  Now listen.  He goes, you tell me how to fucking...  We go up there, and you tell me what to do. 
[03:21:00]  Bobby don't do no rehearsing shit.  We don't do no dress shit.  You tell me.  I tell Bobby.  He comes do the real show.  Shit.  He goes, you got a problem with that?  I said, no, I don't got a problem with that.  He goes, I already talked to Lauren.  So as soon as he left, I ran to Lorne Michaels.  I'm like, Lord, he said, De Niro's not coming.  This is when I knew how powerful Lorne was.  He'll be here.  I went, I'm just telling you.  He said, he's not coming.  He'll be here.  Now, the...  Lorne's a powerful dude.  Powerful dude. 
[03:21:30]  The dress show.  De Niro's not coming.  It's announced.  He didn't know the show was live.  He's not coming.  He's backed the whole thing out.  But Pesci's still going to come.  So now, they dress up Daryl Hammond as the fake De Niro.  I'm like, so me and the writer are like, you can't, you can't have me and Colin Quinn as the, I'm the Pesci, Colin's the De Niro, and then have the real Pesci come out with another fake De Niro. 
[03:22:00]  Just have Pesci come out.  Like, no, no, no.  And right down to, one minute to go.  I look over.  I see Daryl dressed up.  And I'm just, I'm like, this is going to be the dumbest sketch in the world.  It's so stupid.  It's ruining, 30 seconds.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I looked at Daryl.  I'm like, Daryl, he's not here.  And he's gone.  He's not here.  That's exactly Daryl.  He just summed up Daryl Hammond's spirit.  Right. 
[03:22:30]  So, the sketch starts.  And I literally looked to his side.  I see Pesci, and I see freaking Daryl dressed as De Niro.  And I went, a full-blown depression.  Yeah.  The dress show.  We're, you know, they're filming.  I'm like, hey, it's Joe Pesci.  I half-ass it, because I'm like, this is, this ain't going to go.  And then, all of a sudden, I'm like, that's it.  I'm Joe Pesci.  I hear, oh.  And I turn around, and it's fucking De Niro with his cap.  And I'm just thinking about it.  I'm getting giddy. 
[03:23:00]  And I looked over, and he's glaring at me, Jimbo.  He's looking at me, and he's going like this.  He's doing that famous nod.  Now, he comes over.  The first line he's supposed to say is, he's supposed to look at Colin Quinn and go, who  are you supposed to be?  That's all he's going to say.  Well, they come walking over.  Pesci's like, you know, I see you.  Everything out of his mouth.  Ten fucking minutes.  All of a sudden, there's silence, because De Niro's not doing his line.  And he reeks of wine. 
[03:23:30]  Totally reeks of wine.  So, while he's standing, he's kind of not paying attention, and Pesci looks at him, and  De Niro looks at him, and he's like, what?  And Pesci goes, you're the fucking line.  And he gives him an elbow, and then De Niro literally goes like this.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.  Who are you supposed to be?  So, now, when the real show, you'd appreciate this, when the real show started, right before  it came out.  You've been to Sound It Live? 
[03:24:00]  I have, yeah.  All right, so you know.  With you.  Really?  Yeah, you introduced me to Metallica.  That's right.  97.  That's right.  So, when, in that hallway, when the hallway's packed, it's usually packed with all these  meatheads.  Pesci and De Niro come walking down the hall.  I've never seen this ever happen in the history of Sound It Live.  You know, everyone's gathered around the miles, they're in the hallways, all of a sudden,  silence, and they parted like the Red Sea, and just De Niro and Pesci real quietly walked  by everyone, and De Niro's looking, I don't, I don't, I don't. 
[03:24:30]  And no one said, Mr. Pesci, they just walked by, walked to the green room, and as soon as  they went away, it was like this, holy shit.  Yeah.  And then everyone went back to buzzing.  So, the only time I got to meet him was when the show was over, the sketch was over,  and Pesci said, Jimmy, which, every time you call me Jimmy, I'm like, you call me Jimmy.  I'm going to be a good fella's part, too.  He said, Jimmy, did you meet Bobby?  He's dying to meet you.  I went, oh my God.  So, I go meet him.  I swear to God, I'm not doing a bit. 
[03:25:00]  He's just staring at me, and he's going, he's going, you're good.  You're very good.  You're very, very fun.  Very good.  I said, can you sign my raging bull tape?  Go ahead, go get, go get the tape, go get the tape.  I get the tape, I bring it down.  He writes, you know, to Jim, a real good fella.  That's great.  And he goes, you're good.  A real good fella.  Oh, he did that whole thing.  You're good.  You're good.  And when you got problems with that pizza guy, you call me.  You call me.  That's right, dude.  A bag of rocks.  So, and you appreciate this.  I wanted to give a thanks to the two of them. 
[03:25:30]  So, I called their assistant.  It's like, what can I do to thank these guys?  Pesci's like, he loves cigars.  I know where he buys his cigars.  I said, all right, I'll go there.  I go there.  I go there.  I'm like, I'm looking for really good cigars.  He sold me the fucking counter stuff.  He's like, who's it for?  I went, believe it or not, it's for Joe Pesci.  And he went, oh, come back here.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, we got one.  Oh, shit. 
[03:26:00]  This is how stupid I am.  I swear to God, I'm not even exaggerating this, and I accept being this dumb.  I go back, and he shows me the box of Cuban, whatever, I don't know cigars.  Good ones.  Good ones.  He takes the case out.  I said, all right, well, how much does that cost?  He's like, you know, $6.50.  I went, all right, let's do that.  That's how stupid I am.  I take out a $10. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, no.  No way.  I slept in.  He's like, you know, he's like, you're really funny.  Hey, comedian.  And I go, well, how much is it?  He's like, $650.  I went, for the fucking cigars?  $650?  $650?  $650?  He's like, we went the whole box.  Like, $1,000 for cigars?  Holy shit.  So, I buy the freaking cigars.  I don't know you got to purify or whatever.  I stick them in my fridge. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, no.  I didn't know you did.  I swear to God.  Purify.  You hit a fire.  Roddy B's crying.  A week later, they're peeling and shit, and I'm ready to send them out.  My friend's like, dude, you can't send that shit to Pesci.  You got to buy a new box.  I'm like, come on, buy another box for $1,000.  You feel crazy?  So, I never sent him the thank you box.  You bought them and just fucking...  And they died in my refrigerator.  You killed a bucket of cigars.  Cohibes.  Cohibes.  That's what they were.  Cohibes. 
[03:27:30]  Cohiggins.  Ah, Cohiggins.  That's great.  With that, we're getting out of here, man.  Fucking Brewer.  Thank you so much.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Amazing.  I got it, Jimmy.  The Hart Theater at the Egg in Albany, New York, tonight.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.  Tomorrow night, okay.  And then Saturday, I'm sorry, because we had to rework this.  Saturday, Tarrytown Music Hall in Tarrytown, New York.  And you can go to jimbrewer.com, and jimbrewer on Twitter, and jimbrewer on Facebook.  I do Facebook.  I'm not going to let's me on there.  You like the Facebook, huh? 
[03:28:00]  I love the Facebook.  And Jimmy starts Caroline's tonight.  Tonight through Saturday.  It's an 8 o'clock show tonight.  And Kansas City, I think, next week with Jim Florentine on Saturday.  Hey, that's a good show.  Oh, and I'll be on a Joy Behar show tonight.  I don't know what time it is.  Whoa!  I want to see that.  I don't know what time it is.  I forget what time that's on.  Headline news.  All I know is I'm going to give it 110%.  Yell it her.  Why?  I like Joy.  She always defends comics.  Yeah, she's a comedian.  Comedians are always first.  Comics will always defend other comics.  Yes.  We have our own law. 
[03:28:30]  We have an undefined law.  Like, it's a respect of law.  You know, but he raped her.  Yeah, but he's funny.  You know.  You should get some of your comedy friends to take care of the pizza guy.  Maybe you can get some of your comedy friends to come down.  You know, you get your comedy friends.  Maybe we can do benefit for him.  I'll make a men's benefit.  Jim Brewer does not get that pie.  It'll make him really full.  He came along with his lazy eye and his petty impression. 
[03:29:00]  If you're just tuning in, Brewer told a story that went probably an hour, and it's some great radio.  Some great storytelling from Brewer.  I got a note from Danny.  If anyone wants to come to tonight's show, I have a pair of tickets to give away.  Just call.  They'll take care of you off air.  They'll take care of you off air.  All right, good.  And thank you.  All right, we'll see you guys tomorrow for the Friday edition.  We've got to start talking about the homeless shopping spree.  Let's start talking about that some more tomorrow.  But it's going down three weeks from today.  Homeless shopping spree is back. 
[03:29:30]  A mall somewhere in Jersey.  Way less than an hour's ride from New York City.  So make plans now to join us for the homeless shopping spree three weeks from today.  Afternoon drive.  You want to do it, Brewer?  When?  I'll tell you, that was the best of it.  I think I remember the first one or the second.  We're going to blow this one out.  I'm telling you.  And you guys came back with more homeless people.  Yeah.  Sam, you got some of this?  No, I'm just saying it's two weeks from today.  No.  17.  What? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Two weeks.  Let's try it.  What?  Two weeks.  That was the funniest thing.  Two weeks we got to figure this shit out?  You guys went to Far Hills.  We got it.  Oh, yeah.  The fucking...  Far Hills.  Short Hills.  And it worked against...  Because everyone's listening.  And everyone was giving everything to them.  And then you guys sent, like, let's say 20 guys there.  And then, like, 22 came back.  Yeah.  Like they picked up homeless friends.  We got two weeks to figure this shit out? 
[03:30:30]  Yes, we do.  We got it.  We don't have bum number one.  You hear the tonic?  This bag is on TV.  Yeah, we'll figure it all out.  Homeless shopping spree, two weeks from today.  Doing it in afternoon drive.  So make plans now to join us.  It's going to be a big one this time around.  All right, guys.  See you tomorrow. </pre>
