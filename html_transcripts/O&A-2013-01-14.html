<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Jim Norton recounting a successful stand-up weekend in Nashville, surprisingly finding receptive audiences despite his preconceived notions about the cityâ€™s country music scene and the presence of the Ku Klux Klan.  The conversation then transitioned to the Golden Globes and Miss America Pageant.  Norton expressed his disdain for football, a comment that subsequently drew online homophobic attacks.  The hosts and Norton engaged in sexually explicit commentary regarding the physical attractiveness of various Miss America contestants, repeatedly praising Miss South Carolina and criticizing Miss New York.  Their discussion was highly focused on the contestants' appearances and involved numerous sexually charged remarks.

Next, the show shifted its focus to the Golden Globes, with commentary on Kevin Costner and Anne Hathaway's acceptance speeches and the overall event.  Bill Clinton's unexpected appearance prompted highly explicit speculation about his past sexual encounters with actresses.  The show concluded with a detailed, humorous, and at times explicit, analysis of the movie *Argo*.  The hosts compared the film's depiction of the Iranian hostage rescue with a documentary, highlighting discrepancies such as the exaggeration of the Americans' danger and the omission of certain details concerning the extraction.  The discussion included sexually explicit jokes related to plot points in the film.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  The jokes all end up talking about cock and ball. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest net ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  The rules are destroyed.  The rules are destroyed and conventions burn to the grove.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  She's cocked.  With Opie, the destroyer. 
[00:04:30]  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass because it makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful, but I just can't take them.  The Opie Anthony Show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt. 
[00:05:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ooh.  Look at us.  We're on the air.  We're broadcasting.  Yes, we are.  Yeah.  Don't you love getting up early on Monday morning, knowing that you've got a whole week  ahead of you of doing something that other people want you to do?  All right.  Well, you know what?  We all got a boss.  He was just a man upstairs.  Ah, regular Joe. 
[00:05:30]  I gotta agree with that one.  That's how I feel.  I don't mind coming in, but that getting up shit.  It's for the birds, quite literally, because they get up early.  The early bird gets the worm, but the early worm, he's got a problem.  See, because the bird.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah.  That was everybody's weekend.  Good?  Jimmy, you were in...  Yeah, it was good.  Where were you?  Tennessee?  Yeah, Nashville.  Nashville.  And it was a very satisfying weekend. 
[00:06:00]  Was it?  Yeah.  There were good crowds?  Great crowds, yeah.  I like that.  I was...  And I was your opie's friend, Jim Chandler.  I was...  Oh, yes.  I wanted to do...  Right.  ...his buddy, but...  Oh, what happened?  We couldn't, but it was nothing to do with us.  It was the fact that...  I think that station, which is Clear Channel, only allows...  Won't let zanies, comedians on at all because they don't advertise, which is like a Clear Channel  thing.  That has nothing to do with his show.  So, he might have done it, but it was... 
[00:06:30]  Stupid.  That's a parent company.  That's a great...  It just hurts the shows.  Of course, that was John, opie's friend that we had featured on...  Jim.  Jim.  Jim and Woody.  Jim, who we had featured on Jocktober one year, right?  Yeah.  This year.  This year.  And in the middle of it, opie went, oh my God, oh my God.  That's the guy I worked with.  Yeah.  Not only worked with, went to college with, started with...  Made love to.  Went to war together.  Played golf together. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, so...  Is Tennessee like...  Is Nashville...  I went there once, but I was kind of...  I didn't really go out much.  I went to a few bars.  Is it very country?  Is it very...  You did more than I did when I was there, my friend.  Yeah.  Really?  I hole up in the hotel.  I'm a terrible, terrible guy on the road.  But when you go out and you're doing the club there, are there people with cowboy hats  on in the audience?  No, no, no.  I knew there was a lot of Klan there at one point.  Oh.  I don't know if there still is.  Well...  I didn't say that for you. 
[00:07:30]  Call my real estate broker.  It was...  That's what I've heard.  Yeah?  No, they're just regular.  The fans are the fans everywhere, man.  They're the same...  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  In the middle of the country there, they're not all fucking country bumpkins.  No.  They're the same.  You know, at the end, they're just going, I love you, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of, I fucking love you, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the same...  A little bit of a different accent, but they're the same guy.  Same fatzos.  Yeah.  Same fucking disasters.  Yes.  But they were very good.  Oh, that's very nice.  I had one of the better sets I've had in years on Saturday. 
[00:08:00]  Really?  In years.  I never get standing ovations.  Wow.  That's called walking out, Jimmy.  There's one way to...  Dude, it was really weird.  It was a silent clap, and they all went outside just to greet me later.  A tribute of me.  Yeah, Saturday early show was...  And Friday was great.  I really enjoyed the week.  Oh, goody.  Goody.  Did you get back in time to watch the Golden Globes?  I did.  And some of the games I watched when I was there.  Ah.  And when I came back, yeah.  Yeah.  I did get back to watch the Golden Globes. 
[00:08:30]  That's why I came home.  Yes, of course.  I was watching movies that were nominated.  I made the rounds to all the movie theaters this weekend to make sure I saw many of the  movies that had been nominated.  I wanted to make sure.  Right.  So, oh, I was in my car.  I was at a movie theater.  I was back home, back to another movie theater.  It was crazy.  Wow.  It was crazy.  And as I'm tweeting things about various movies, and we'll talk about also the Miss 
[00:09:00]  America pageant.  And I tuned into that to watch some of those fucking women that look like they're moms.  They're not even that hot.  They all look weathered.  But I'm tweeting it, and I keep getting tweet after tweet of people going, what's the matter  with you?  The game's on.  What's the matter with you?  Football's on, dummy.  Why aren't you?  I don't like football.  I apologize to everyone who believes that that is the key to heterosexuality and was 
[00:09:30]  calling me a faggot all weekend for not watching football.  But I'll tell you, I just don't like watching football.  It's okay, Jimmy.  Don't panic.  It's not on anything electrical.  Jimmy spilled his coffee.  Jimmy spilled his coffee.  Yeah, it was constant.  Every tweet, I tweeted about what I was watching, what I was doing, the game's on.  Like, they couldn't believe that anything with a penis isn't tuned into the game. 
[00:10:00]  Sorry.  I'm not a big fan.  If the Jets or Giants are playing, and it's, you know, postseason or something, perhaps I'll  tune in.  Perhaps.  Because it's, you know, relevant.  But I just don't, I'm not a big fan of watching football, regardless of playoffs.  I could, I could know the scores.  I know the Pats won.  I know Tom Brady kicked ass, and he's now the most winning postseason quarterback. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Why do I have to sit through the whole fucking game to see that while I'm missing fucking  Miss America?  Blow me.  I like the, I like Miss South Carolina.  That was your one.  Holy fuck was she hot.  And, and she played the piano very nicely.  As opposed to Miss New York, who won, who did a tap dance.  A few of these women were doing tap dances.  What year is this?  They're doing like, and poorly, mind you. 
[00:11:00]  Like, if they were on any of these talent shows, X Factor, American Idol, any of that, and  they tried tap dancing like that, they would be thrown the fuck out of there.  And then another couple of women, they were trying to sing.  The singing with the, look, they're hot girls, right?  Yeah.  I guess they're raised to be hot girls, and their singing was abominable.  All off key, and fucking horrible song choices and everything. 
[00:11:30]  And then the talent portion has always been so stupid.  It's so lame.  It's just like, well, we can't just have them stand up on stage and be hot, can we?  Yeah.  No, they need to, they need to have talent, and we need to ask them questions.  They're always stupid.  They're always talentless.  Talentless and dumb.  Yeah.  Everyone tunes in for the swimsuit competition.  Because that's all you want to see.  This Miss South Carolina was so fucking smoking.  And then she tickled the old Ivories playing the Pi-Annie. 
[00:12:00]  And she was good.  That's her, right?  Let me see her.  I can't see Travis.  Look at this fucking piece of meat.  Look at this piece of fucking meat.  She's really cute.  She's cute, and her body was smoking.  What am I getting to know her?  Oh, yeah.  And she lost to Miss New York, who stunk.  She did a big, she big and long, lanky, and doing this fucking tap dance, looking silly.  Just looking silly.  But was she hot, Miss New York?  No.  I didn't see what she looked like. 
[00:12:30]  No.  She had that look like, Miss South Carolina is the only girl that looked like she actually  was supposed to be a Miss America.  All the rest look like Misses America.  Miss.  They're Miss.  They're all weathered like fucking, they look like MILFs.  They all look like MILFs.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's, that's not her, is it?  Yeah.  Miss Mallard, whatever her name is.  She's all right, but I like the, you just won Miss America, and they opened their mouth  in that blowjob. 
[00:13:00]  You know how photoshopped you can make that look her hand?  That's New York?  Yeah.  Oh my God, yeah.  Looks like she's holding a pekka.  It does.  Her hand is out in a fist, and her mouth is open real wide.  I'm sure they're out there already.  She's from Alabama originally, right?  She was born there, I think.  Yeah, apparently that, and she came to New York with a thousand dollars in a pocket and  a big wet pussy to get some fucking place to live.  Yeah.  Well, that just, you know.  But, but I was watching that, and it's because I tune in, and I see hot women walking around. 
[00:13:30]  They're like, oh, what's this?  And I stop.  They're the game!  Why aren't you watching the game?  No.  It's true, though.  There's one highlight, usually, per game.  Yeah.  And you just watch it later.  On, like, one of the blogs or something.  It's an awesome game!  Awesome game!  This bit!  And then they just start mentioning players' names.  I don't know.  Who cares?  You didn't care?  Not a bit!  I couldn't be bothered.  Frank Langer turds had nine tackles. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, you know.  Ah, if they would have picked up and then, pfft, insert some jock here.  Yeah, it would have been a lot better.  Oh, and then the injuries, they got fucking snarly waddle cock is out, and fucking...  Ah!  I don't like football.  Especially on TV.  Gives a shit.  A bunch of jocks.  Don't care.  But apparently I'm a flaming homosexual for not enjoying the football game. 
[00:14:30]  It's one of many reasons.  Well, yeah, but I mean...  Dad was right.  You are a faggot.  That's what they were saying, also.  Yeah, my dad...  Oh, who's that?  Miss New York?  Yeah, that's South Carolina.  Yeah, that's South Carolina.  Look at that meaty fucking bitch.  They have nice legs.  Nice pretty smiles.  She looked great.  It was a robbery that she lost.  Isn't she a little thicker than they normally are?  Yeah.  In a good way, though.  She looks like a real woman.  Like a girl.  Just fucking eat that ass, right?  Oh, I don't know.  I have to get to know her first, Ant. 
[00:15:00]  Depending on what type of girl she is.  Why did she lose?  I don't know.  She was the first runner-up.  So it was her.  It was her and New York, and they're standing right next to each other,  holding each other's hands like they really give a shit if the other one wins.  And then they said Miss New York.  And I think even New York knew.  She was like, ah, I should have lost to this fucking nice hot piece of ass.  Maybe it was because of Hurricane Sandy.  Maybe they decided to give it to New York.  Imagine if her name was Sandy. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, that would have been big, too.  Right?  Yeah.  Like anyone cares.  I don't even care about it.  I just thought they were fucking incredibly hot.  Golden Globes, also, this weekend.  That was the big view.  The big thing everybody was tweeting about.  You know what I like better about the Golden Globes than the Oscars is that it's not as predictable.  It really is not as predictable as the Oscars.  It was like, it best, best, everything doesn't always go hand in hand like it does at the Oscars.  So I was kind of happy to see that.  Yeah.  I like the fact that the people in the audience are drinking, too. 
[00:16:00]  They sit there at tables, and they get booze, and they're allowed to just fucking whoop it up.  And sometimes you get those people that come up, and they're a little inebriated, a little intoxicated.  See, I think Louie was sitting at Costner's table.  I only saw him get up for a second.  Oh.  But there was one shot.  I watched a little bit at Bob Kelly's house, and fucking Louie stood up, and I think it was at Costner.  I was like, well, that's a pretty good place to sit.  Wow.  Louie's really fucking Hollywood, man. 
[00:16:30]  He's not a Hollywood guy, but he's in.  He's in there.  He has breached the fucking wall.  He's in.  I just kept thinking how I'd be running around from table to table with my camera.  Oh, how embarrassing would you be?  Did you really do that?  Oh, my God.  That would be funny.  Oh, can I get a picture?  You know, I'm just...  Hey, Judd, could you introduce me in this song?  But, like, Ben Affleck wins the award, and he gets up, and he starts walking to pick up his trophy there and give his speech.  Then Jimmy just gets him in the aisle.  Ah, Ben, excuse me. 
[00:17:00]  Someone's taking a picture with Ben Affleck in the middle of him accepting his award.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  That would be an embarrassing fool.  Would you?  You see Louie or no?  Yeah, there he is.  There he is.  Oh, Kevin Costner.  Oh, yeah, I just saw Louie.  Kevin Costner's speech was maybe the most boring thing I've ever seen on television.  Kevin Costner's not an exciting guy.  He's not.  No, he's not an exciting actor.  But he's a good actor.  And that was...  I'll tell you, the speech was boring, but it ended on time.  As opposed to Anne Hathaway, who fucking sing-song-yammered for 45 minutes. 
[00:17:30]  They put the music on, she just started to sing her stupid speech.  What did Kevin Costner want for what?  Hatfields and McCoys.  Oh, Hatfields and McCoys.  Hatfields!  What about fucking Bill Paxton?  Did Bill Paxton get anything?  I don't think so.  What the fuck?  He was the other guy.  But all the people that are in front of the camera, behind it.  Oh, boy.  People in Romania. 
[00:18:00]  Is that a joke?  I just want to say this.  I don't want to be long this night, but I just couldn't help thinking the first time  I came into this room.  Oh, boy.  It was a long time ago.  Yeah?  What happened?  I was an unknown actor.  How did you get tickets?  I had two bad knees.  I walked on it.  And the bolts were going, and they were flashing.  Holy shit!  The photographers were yelling at the actors to look at them, and no one said anything  to me.  I was just walking and hoping to have some kind of career.  Oh, yeah?  I came into this room, and the lights went down, and I watched us celebrate the career. 
[00:18:30]  And I fucked Cal Ripken's wife.  Yeah?  Well, I had sex with your wife.  To watch his body of work.  I see a lot of friends out here.  Wow, this is dumb.  I don't know.  It was the worst.  It's all monotone, too.  Maybe even borrowed.  Did he speak like this in Waterworld?  Oh, no.  No way.  I want to thank the Golden Gloves, because it is a great night to celebrate.  But more importantly, we get a chance to illuminate movies that maybe people might not have ever 
[00:19:00]  seen now.  Yeah, but they will.  Story didn't even tell anybody.  No one is even like Lex.  And then, you know who followed him?  Who?  As if to make him even less interesting?  Who?  Clinton came out next.  Ah!  And it was just a wash for Kevin Costner.  Hello, Bill!  That was a...  I thought when Clinton came on, and Costner, and I guess it was Amy and Tina Fey that walked  off together.  All of them walked off together.  How much it must suck to walk off while Clinton's...  And you want to just go, hi? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, you want to at least acknowledge.  Even though they all probably know him.  They've all, I'm sure, met him, but...  I'm sure, yeah.  Yeah.  I want to try to get my picture signed, Bill.  Could you...  It was a, I guess, a big night for Ben Affleck and Argo, which is one of the films I did  see.  Did they know he was going to be there, or no?  Like, five people knew.  Really?  That's it?  Yeah.  And what did he do?  I missed him in his speech.  He introduced the clip for Lincoln, like they show a clip for all the nominated movies. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, I get it.  And it still didn't win Best Picture.  How do you have Clinton, and he gave the salute to fucking Spielberg, who saluted him?  Well, I think they vote before the clips are shown.  No, but I mean, it's just amazing.  Like, how do you not win with that?  It was fun to watch a guy, though.  Like, you know, I'm such a celebrity fruit.  Yes.  But it was nice to see somebody who can alpha male all the celebrities.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nobody captures a room like him.  Like, the second he walks in, everybody's up on their feet.  But the second you see him, you think he stuck a cigar in some bitch's pussy. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Also.  Like, he's...  That's why you stand.  Exactly.  I was thinking about him getting blown by actresses and stuff.  Yeah, the blowjobs.  How do you picture him?  I picture him leaning against the desk in the Oval Office with his legs really straight,  but he's leaning against the desk, and she's just sucking his cock, and he's looking down  like rubbing her hair with his hand.  I always pictured him in his chair, sitting.  Oh, sitting.  With his jacket and shirt still on, but no pants.  No pants!  Yeah, no, and he's just getting blown. 
[00:21:00]  I picture his, kind of like what Sam does, he's got his jacket on, but his pants are  around his ankles, and his legs look like an older man's legs than you'd expect, and  I'm just looking up at him, and I'm going like, wow, his balls smell worse than I thought  they would.  Oh, I see.  Jimmy's imagining he's sucking his cock.  I get it.  No.  Jimmy.  I picture him with sock garters, too.  Those old sock garters are very pasty legs.  I was going to say, his socks are rolled down, but he's got the marks on his legs from where 
[00:21:30]  they were pulled up.  And he could fuck half the actresses in that room.  Oh, of course he could.  He probably has, right?  Well, I'm sure some of them married and they could, but he could go in there and fuck  a lot of those actresses.  He's probably trying to fuck Jodie Foster all night.  Yeah, that's a challenge.  Just because he likes to challenge.  Fuck the dyke right out of her.  Yeah, that's how, and every time you see him, I mean, he's a very powerful guy, president.  His legacy as president is pretty goddamn good compared to others.  In hindsight, it's great. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And you could just picture him getting his dick sucked, which I guess makes it all the  better.  So wait, five people knew he was going to be there and that's it?  Yeah, I mean, from what I read, there were a select few people in the Hollywood foreign  press that knew, and everybody else just knew that there was going to be a surprise.  What if I knew?  They didn't know it was Clinton.  I'm sure once the Secret Service comes in to sweep everything, they knew that, right?  They don't just let him into a place.  Well, no, I mean, once he got there, I think, you know, he's not invisible, so people probably  saw him. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, he's not?  But he literally probably came in five minutes before he was going out.  Probably, yeah.  I know when he does, when any president does like the Tonight Show, and I'm sure it's the  same for Letterman, they drive up the fucking ramp into the building and get out,  and maybe they're in their dressing room for five minutes, get a little makeup, and they  walk right out.  It needs no fucking time.  They don't make him wait?  No.  I'm sorry, Mr. President, you've been bumped today for an author about, you know, animal  stories.  Yeah.  But, yeah, Ben Affleck was the big winner.  Argo.  I saw Argo. 
[00:23:00]  It was one of the movies that I was able to catch over the weekend.  Do you like the part that you liked?  I like the fucking, I like the car chase with the plane angle.  Yes, the 747 down the runway at the end of the movie, and the cars and military vehicles  and police vehicles chasing the 747, which just barely gets off the runway and clears  the barrier, and then the cars go.  And they're shaking their fists as the plane.  They're like, ah, you Americans.  As opposed to just calling the tower and saying, stop that plane. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  Because you'd always chase it down the runway, wouldn't you?  Of course you would.  Of course.  Yeah, radio to the pilot, please don't go forward anymore.  And those pictures that got through.  Remember the pictures got through?  Yes, they shredded the documents of the six people that had gotten away.  Of course, you know the story by now.  It's, you know, the Iranians, when they took over the embassy back in 79, six Americans  were able to slip out and took residence in the Canadian Ambassadors, what was he, the 
[00:24:00]  Canadian...  Canadian Ambassadors.  Yeah, Ambassadors Residence.  And they had to stay there for quite a while, and then they had to figure out, the CIA had  to figure out a way to get them out.  So they needed this ploy, and they came up with a fake movie and a fake movie production  company and everything, and said that these six people were Canadian filmmakers that were  in Iran, and now they're leaving.  And it's all the paperwork that went behind it, and all the cloak-and-dagger-y CIA kind 
[00:24:30]  of stuff to get them out, which, of course, they did.  But they showed these, because they were shredding documents at the embassy when they knew it  was going to be taken over.  And the bad guys got all the shredded documents, and they got these children to put it all  together.  And slowly, they started putting together pictures of these six Americans that had  escaped, and they're like, why?  How did these people get away?  Right.  We gotta find them.  I wonder if they did try to do that.  I don't know about that part.  I didn't see that in the documentary.  I think they tried to, because at the end of the movie, when they were doing credits, 
[00:25:00]  they showed, like, the real shit.  I'm sure it wasn't the pictures, though, and it wasn't the six people, and it wasn't the  fucking...  I'm sure they found shredded documents, and they're like, ah, what's this?  Let's try to stick it together.  There was a process of trying to reassemble shredded documents.  We applied for military...  Right.  Military secrets, not...  Yeah, yeah, not for the pictures.  Can't they reassemble documents that are shredded, or no?  I think it can, but it's probably pretty fucking difficult.  Yeah.  And nowadays, they got those cross-cut shredders, where they cut them in strips, and then 
[00:25:30]  cut them again the other way, so it's more like confetti than strips.  And then it's, like, really hard.  And then they incinerate the shit, too.  So, I just, I saw, unfortunately for me, I ruined my movie-going experience.  I saw the documentary on the History Channel, or whatever the fuck it was, about Argo.  And the truth of the matter is, they were never really in any danger whatsoever.  Yes, they were.  No, Chippa.  No, Chippa.  The Ayatollah was outside the window looking for them?  Yes, if they were caught, it would have been terrible, you know. 
[00:26:00]  But they never were really in any danger of being caught.  And when you watch the documentary, I mean, it's a good thing they had this cover story  in place just in case, but they never needed it.  You mean the phone call to the movie place never happened, where the phone kept ringing  and ringing and ringing?  Right, right.  Never happened.  Or when he had to go and check into the plane, but his ticket had been canceled, and they  literally...  Last minute had the reservations, like, that came up. 
[00:26:30]  Meanwhile, they had two sets of tickets for two separate flights, just in case there was  a problem with the first flight, in real life.  Then they had them in their hands.  In their fucking hands.  They didn't have to check in with them.  No, they didn't have to check in.  They didn't leave that to chance.  No, they did not.  You mean there wasn't a budget problem the last minute that the CIA wouldn't approve  the budget to the...  No, they were allowed to do whatever the fuck they wanted to get those people out of there.  And I know it's a movie, and you have to, but it's a...  They just wreck everything, even though it was a really good movie. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  But then I was interested in just the story, the fact that these people...  I mean, really, there was a tremendous danger if they got caught.  Right.  They actioned it up because nothing really happened.  They were given their passport.  They literally could have gone to the airport with the Canadian passports.  With no cover story.  And just gone right through.  Did they have cover stories in real life?  They probably did, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They had these very, you know, detailed cover stories of who they were in this film crew.  They did have a film, a fake film that was in the Hollywood magazines in L.A. 
[00:27:30]  I mean, they had all of it.  They just didn't wind up not needing it.  And in the movie, they showed it as being crucial.  Like, they needed that background story.  And, you know, the guy pulls out the storyboards and starts telling one of the guards that, you know, this is what happens.  That never happened.  No.  I think there were two moments, only two moments where they were like, uh-oh, what's happening?  They had a point where there was the yellow sheet that had to match the white sheet at the airport. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  You get, you fill out the form, they give you the yellow sheet, they take the white sheet.  And then when you come back to leave the airport, they look in a file and try to find the white sheet to match with the yellow sheet.  They didn't have any because they never really came in as Canadians.  But they determined that no one ever checked those sheets.  They never checked them.  They didn't even look.  Never even looked.  They didn't even have to establish, oh, we must have lost them.  Nope.  Because they were like, okay, I'm sure they're there.  They realized at the airport, through investigating that, they never check them anyway. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  They just grab your sheet and you go through.  So they never had to deal with that.  But as one guy was at the counter, he grabbed his sheet and walked into the back room.  And the guy is standing there like, uh-oh, what the fuck is going on?  And then the Iranian comes out with a cup of tea.  He's steeping a little tea bag in his tea.  He just happened to grab the guy's sheet when he thought of going back to get some tea.  And he came back, gave the guy his forehead.  Oh, is that where the tea got thrown on the guy because it was Jew-illuminating tea? 
[00:29:00]  And he threw the Jew-illuminating tea on him.  And all of a sudden, the tea hit the Canadian and he started speaking Yiddish.  That's exactly it.  Jew-illuminating tea.  That was in the movie.  I don't think that happened in real life.  That and then when they were at the airport or at the terminal waiting for the plane, there  was an announcement that the plane was going to be an hour late for mechanical problems.  And that kind of freaked them out.  They thought maybe it was some ploy to keep them there longer. 
[00:29:30]  But no, there were genuinely mechanical problems.  It was fixed.  They boarded the plane.  The plane took off with no cars in hot pursuit on the runway.  They took off.  They cleared Iranian airspace.  And, uh... </pre>
