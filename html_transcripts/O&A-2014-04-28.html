<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, covering several topics.  He discussed the Donald Sterling racism scandal, Joan Rivers' controversial joke about the Cleveland kidnapping (with a role-played response), Clive Bundy's racist statements (with audio clips played), and a disappointing Frankie Valli concert (with a YouTube clip shown).  The pre-show also featured discussion of rival show Humble and Fred (who were expected to call in), internet memes about Humble and Fred, Jim Norton's mysterious weekend at Caroline's, and a segment mocking radio DJ Scorch.  Numerous callers participated, and the conversation was informal and frequently used vulgar language.

The main show heavily featured the Donald Sterling audio recording, revealing his racist tirade against his girlfriend for associating with black people.  The hosts, describing Sterling as a "doddering sugar daddy," offered commentary throughout, noting reactions from Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Adam Silver, President Obama, Snoop Dogg, and Victor Willis. They speculated on the girlfriend's motivations, suggesting possible blackmail.  A second audio clip further highlighted Sterling's outrage.

Next, Humble and Fred were interviewed. They discussed their career, their choice to stay in their "crappy little building" studio in Etobicoke despite SiriusXM offers, and their experiences with often incompetent program directors and consultants, recounting humorous and often vulgar anecdotes.  They detailed the "Jocktober" online attacks, including examples like “AIDS fires.”  Their relationship with Howard Stern was also briefly mentioned.  The segment concluded with a heated call from Steve, debating racial issues and the Donald Sterling controversy with Anthony, followed by Jimmy's announcement of his new Vice.com show.  Phil and Eileen from Humble and Fred's team were also mentioned, with Eileen briefly speaking.

A subsequent segment started with a discussion of racial dynamics in online videos, followed by accusations of Roger Waters lip-syncing (with YouTube evidence). The hosts then criticized Alicia Silverstone's book on "kind living," focusing on her views on veganism, vaccinations, and elimination communication.  Anthony shared childhood anecdotes about wearing his mother's shoes and using a back massager as a pretend cigar.  The conversation also included analysis of an Aerosmith music video and showcasing a Mexican singer’s impressive Guns N' Roses covers.  The segment concluded with listener calls and discussions involving listener tweets, a host’s birthday, and alleged old videos of Anthony smoking marijuana.

The show continued with sexually suggestive banter referencing "Good Times" and Playboy, followed by playing and critiquing covers by YouTube musician Juan the Beast.  A lengthy and explicit phone call with "Lady Di," her friend Marion, and Bill involved discussion of Lady Di's alleged crack cocaine use, theft, and sex work, with Google Street View used to investigate locations mentioned.  "Ponytail" from a liquor store was also mentioned. The segment ended with a brief discussion of a Craigslist ad seeking sexual encounters with a horse.

Numerous commercial breaks were interspersed throughout the show, including ads for Barracuda Message Archiver, New Relic, Famous Smoke's cigars, Shell Rotella oil, SiriusXM, Retro Fitness, Steven Singer Jewelers, Smart Mouth, Remax, SurePayroll, and a call-in segment for post-show discussion.  The post-show featured Sam Roberts, Nicole (recently returned from maternity leave), and "Lady Di."  The conversation focused on Lady Di's crack cocaine use, her father's death, and her past income, interspersed with jokes and banter.  Nicole discussed her experiences as a new mother. The show concluded with more commercials and a West Coast Encore preview.

Breaking down everything that's going to go down today on the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  As well as everything that went down last week on the O.P. and Anthony show.  A lot promised for today's show.  And it hasn't literally been promised, but you know what's coming.  If you've been following the news at all, you know what we're going to talk about.  If you've been following Twitter, you might know who our guests are.  A big, fun O.P. and Anthony show is in store for you today.  So make sure that wherever you're sitting, it's comfortable. 
[00:02:00]  Because you're going to be there for about the next five hours or so.  Before we get to that, I mean, you know what I'm talking about.  Now, there's a new news story around the latest offensive thing going on.  We covered offensive language on Friday with Joan Rivers.  Joan Rivers was on the Today Show.  That story has gone away.  I mean, thanks to this Donald Sterling story.  And we'll get to it on the O.P. and Anthony show today. 
[00:02:30]  You better believe.  The Donald Sterling story.  The guy who owns the Clippers.  Who's decided to tell his girlfriend.  Allegedly, it's him on the tapes.  And you have to say allegedly, but it seems to be him on the tapes.  Telling his girlfriend that he doesn't want her taking photos with black people on Instagram.  And he doesn't want her bringing black people to his basketball games.  You have to hear these tapes if you haven't already.  If you have, then you're looking forward to Opie and Anthony's take on them as much as I am. 
[00:03:00]  He's basically wiped everybody out of the news.  Anybody that had any controversy around them.  Obama made a statement about him over the weekend.  Anybody that had any controversy around them has been wiped out.  The Joan Rivers thing is yesterday's news.  But, you know, Joan Rivers went on the Today Show and made a joke.  And part of the joke was a reference to the Cleveland kidnapping.  So Ant kind of broke into a bit of what Joan Rivers would sound like if she were actually being as offensive as those who were accusing her of would like to believe she was. 
[00:03:30]  This is how it went down on Friday.  This woman, Michelle, she wrote, not sure which was worse, Joan Rivers' joke or the reaction of the Today Show at Willie Geist, Tamron Hall, Natalie Morales, because rape is hysterical.  Which I think she shouldn't have, too.  I don't think that's true.  It wasn't about the rape thing, was it?  It was about the fact that their room was small. 
[00:04:00]  No, no, no.  That Joan Rivers has a smaller room than what they had in their awful situation.  And isn't it funny that they were being raped in there?  It's not like she didn't.  It would have been so offensive if she said that.  Oh, my God, my room is smaller than the vaginas that the man's penis was in.  Oh, my God.  That's not what she said.  No, she didn't say that?  No.  But he said, what reaction are you referring to?  The one of complete disgust?  And she said, well, the silence in this pic illustrates disgust. 
[00:04:30]  If not the right pic, apologies, but it went with the article.  Right.  And so you should really watch the clip before making your grand judgments.  I did not find the joke funny.  In the least.  The point is, you don't have to apologize for Joan Rivers.  She did it on your show.  You guys don't like it as the Today Show, then so be it.  That's just it.  And we'll step forward and have to apologize for what she said is ridiculous.  He didn't apologize on her behalf, is what he was actually arguing about also.  He was apologizing to the people that they heard it on their show. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  You know, it wasn't like we apologize on behalf of Joan Rivers.  Right.  We apologize because you had to hear such insensitive drivel.  Where was he before this?  MSNBC?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're grooming him.  He's going to be the main guy.  But I mean, that's what he did.  He's got to do it sooner than later.  He's got to stop responding to everybody on Twitter.  This is not...  Oh, boy.  If you go through his tweets, like, he's responding to people who claim that he doesn't like his co-hosts.  Like, he responds to everybody. 
[00:05:30]  I'll meet you on the back.  Yeah.  Don't hassle him on Twitter about the apology because that will just bother him and he'll drive me crazy.  You want to throw down?  Let's go out back and throw down.  Come on, internet tough guy.  Yeah, times have changed.  Yes, they have.  A respected journalist is a guy.  Twitter has ruined things for everybody.  Social media has ruined things for a lot of people.  Newscasters used to have respect. 
[00:06:00]  NBA owners' girlfriends used to not have a place to post photos of themselves with black people.  It's been bad for so many people based on what he started with there.  The traditional news anchors, Tom Brokaw and Walter Cronkite, starting Twitter fights.  Ant got further into what it would have been like if the old school newscasters had dealt with Twitter and something like this.  It was a big news story and they are supposed to cover it. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  But I would love to know if the media ever apologizes for their invasive behavior.  I don't remember ever hearing that.  We're sorry we did this.  Yeah.  Not once.  Hey, we're sorry we over covered these school shootings and showed their faces even though profilers and experts have told us that that encourages more people to shoot it.  So we apologize for contributing to the problems.  They see that as their job.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  I see.  So they can use it in their job, but a comedian can't use it in their job.  No. 
[00:07:00]  Got it.  No, don't make a joke.  You're making light of such a serious...  What you do is important.  What no one else does.  Blotty, blotty, blotty, blotty.  Got it.  What do we got here?  A fucking white knight?  A white knight.  It continues.  It wasn't a statement.  It was a joke by a comic.  And should anybody be shocked she won't issue a forced apology?  Yeah, because now people are shocked that she's not apologizing.  Apologizing for a joke she attempted that some certainly found, you know, funny and edgy.  We want to apologize because obviously you wouldn't stick somebody to a wall to babysit them. 
[00:07:30]  Very offensive.  Like a tech offensive.  Walter Cronkite indeed.  But Joan Rivers has learned the valuable lesson.  Well, she probably already knew it.  But she's displaying what we should all be aware of.  If somebody's accusing you of being too offensive or somebody wants to punish you for something you said, just wait until the news cycle keeps going.  Somebody's going to say something worse in a different position than you, and everybody's going to forget.  Joan Rivers is officially out of the water. 
[00:08:00]  Let's head to Bart in Pennsylvania.  Bart, welcome to the Open Anthony Pre-Show.  Morning, professional broadcaster Sam Roberts.  That's what you're trying to interrupt me for?  My bad.  Since you're a professional, it sounded like that TMZ clip of Donald Sterling was edited for time.  Could you tell me if it is, or did you even listen to it?  I definitely listened to it, and we're going to listen to it on today's show.  I didn't notice it was edited for time. 
[00:08:30]  It could have been edited.  I don't know for sure that it wasn't, but what I did notice was that there's no doubt that if his girlfriend is the one that recorded Donald Sterling saying these racist remarks, she did it on purpose, I think.  Because the whole time, she's painting herself to be like this hero of minorities.  And then if you listen to the further tape that's on Deadspin that's like five minutes longer, she's sitting there offering him juice the whole time and calling him honey and acting like she's this wonderful human being. 
[00:09:00]  If you're ever in a fight with your girlfriend, and she's acting friendlier than normal, you better look around the room for a nanny cam or something, because it was not good.  Steven in Tampa.  Prime time, what's going on?  How you doing?  I just wanted to start this Monday off and just let you know, slow!  Well, happy Monday indeed.  Illy in San Antonio, Texas.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Sam Roberts, you professional broadcaster. 
[00:09:30]  Thanks, pal.  I wanted to touch on Rollins and what I thought about him.  A lot of guys are calling in and saying all that.  It's his voice that really gets to me, but if it was just that, I could deal with it.  It's his comebacks.  I think they're non-witty.  And he goes straight for something cheap like suck a dick or burn in hell or something like that.  Well, he does go for the jugular.  And it is interesting.  Thank you, Illy.  It is interesting about Rollins.  I said on the post-show yesterday that two or three people hate Rollins.  I was wrong.  I'll accept my mistakes. 
[00:10:00]  And we'll talk about it probably more in the post-show because here we're trying to rev up to what's going to go on O&A.  But I was on the Internet over the weekend and it was more than two or three people.  So I apologize for my miscalculations as far as that's concerned.  I didn't count properly, I guess, but poor Roland.  Speaking of people to feel sympathy for, and not Donald Sterling.  No, he said it.  He dug his own grave.  I feel bad for Frankie Valli.  Ant went to go see Frankie Valli, the old school singer with his family, to celebrate his birthday. 
[00:10:30]  Ant said he didn't sing a note.  That he had a little switch on his mic that he'd just turn it on to go, oh yeah!  And then just lip-synced, but not even a live recording, but just the record of the song.  We watched one of his old performances on YouTube and it really did match up with exactly what Ant saw.  Let's take a listen.  He makes it look effortless. 
[00:11:00]  It's effortless.  It's effortless because he's not even moving his lips.  Oh, yeah.  That's terrible.  Oh, Barry.  Oh, my.  Pause this.  He sounds way too young.  Right?  That is not even close to him.  Or the current version of him.  It was hilarious.  That's a 50-year-old recording.  Yes.  We were cracking up. 
[00:11:30]  So he's lip-syncing to a 50-year recording.  Yeah.  And he's doing it horribly.  We could tell, like, my brother knows all the technical aspects of live performances and recordings and stuff like that.  So he was watching and he's like, look, the drummer is wearing his monitors in his ears.  So he's working, he's getting the click track through his ears.  What's that mean?  That means, like, he'll just hear a tick, tick, tick, tick, tick for the song to know exactly when he's got to come in, the tempo he has to hold the entire song so that it goes off without a hitch. 
[00:12:00]  You know, he's able to do the vocal and lip-sync over the whole thing.  Right.  And, um...  They're really, the band's really playing.  The band's playing, yep.  They had a live, you know, band there.  I was even a little leery about the backup singers, the Four Seasons guys, because it was perfect.  Not one clunker was hit vocally the entire time. 
[00:12:30]  He still got it.  Like, nothing.  He still got it, yes.  They probably need everyone to lip-sync.  Sure.  To make it smoother.  That's what I'm thinking, to, yeah, to make it really...  Oh, my God, that's embarrassing.  Smooth it out.  That is embarrassing.  You know what's really embarrassing about that clip that I was thinking as I was listening to it?  Because, obviously, I was in the studio when it was happening, so I was kind of, you know, watching off the YouTube.  When you listen to that clip that we just listened to, you know how in the beginning it was the Frankie Valli song?  It sounded like the record.  There was nothing about that that sounded at all live. 
[00:13:00]  That's how it sounds in concert.  The guy's deep into his 80s, I understand, but maybe sometimes it's time to get off the road, you know?  Snowy in Michigan, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony pre-show.  Good morning, Samuel.  Good morning, Snowy.  Let's go back to the Sterling thing.  I know he went to the Frankie Valli.  No, yeah, definitely.  One thing that really bothers me about this, this is ultimately proved that women care nothing about persons that have money because the girlfriend in question is a mixed-race person. 
[00:13:30]  Why in God's name would you be allowed with some guy, if he's racist, it can't be the first time it suddenly dawned on her.  Well, yeah, this was, according to the tapes, it was several times.  He had already requested that she take down photos of her with black people off of her Instagram.  So this was a follow-up to that.  I mean, maybe it's one of those things where she's like, you know what, this guy's rich, and I can eventually sue this guy, or I can blackmail him or whatever. 
[00:14:00]  I don't know.  Exactly.  But, yeah, she's not a good person.  No, but neither one of them, I mean...  They're bad people, both of them.  I was like, you do have a right to say what you want to say.  I'm sorry, you know, crappy things where you're saying it, sure, but I mean, but...  Yeah, but then, I mean, the rest of the team probably has the right to be like, well, fuck you, because most of us are black guys.  I'm sure those guys really could try real hard for the guy now, yeah.  Exactly. 
[00:14:30]  Real hard to approach.  All right.  Thanks, Noe.  Later, man.  Yeah, and I had no idea, but Sal was just telling me that the Clippers are finally becoming actually good.  I always thought they were a bad team, but they're finally good.  We'll see how long that lasts.  Chisel in Pennsylvania.  Hey, Sammy.  Morning.  It just reeks of plantation racism.  When you get an owner saying, they can make me money, you can fuck them, but just don't bring them in the house. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, the boy's in bad trouble.  You got it.  That's an amazing point, Chisel.  You're exactly right about plantation racism.  You got it.  If you don't know what Chisel's talking about, that's a quote.  You can fuck them, but just don't...  You got it.  We'll play the tapes for you once Opie and Anthony begins in just a few minutes.  Let's head to Brandon in California up in the middle of the night.  What's up, Brandon?  Hey, Sammy.  How you doing?  I just wanted to tell you I love the show, man.  Let's see you guys every morning on my long drive from California out to Nevada. 
[00:15:30]  Excellent, man.  What are you doing?  Oh, I do surveying.  We're just driving out to this solar side.  I got to drive out each morning, leave at 1, get there at 5.  Goddamn.  Well, you're doing God's work, Brandon.  Thank you very much, Sam.  Appreciate you guys.  All you guys, E-Rock, Roland.  They're all hilarious.  Don't care what anybody says.  Excellent.  Appreciate what you guys do.  Thank you.  All right.  Talk to you later.  God's work.  Survey.  There's no doubt about it. 
[00:16:00]  Brandon's the man.  Let's keep in mind.  We were talking about offensive comments.  This Donald Sterling thing has become such a big news story that he's kind of gotten Clive  and Bundy out of the news, and you couldn't get more offensive than Clive and Bundy.  Clive and Bundy is the guy that we were talking about on Friday.  He was at the forefront of the movement.  You remember?  He was the guy who the government was trying to take back his land, and he brought an army 
[00:16:30]  of citizens and fought off the government.  And the Tea Partiers and the Second Amendment guys, they were all very much behind this guy  until he opened his stupid mouth.  And that's where we were on Friday when we talked a little bit about the man who's named  Clive and Bundy.  Clive and Bundy said something racist.  Who gives a fuck?  Look at him.  Of course he said something racist.  Who cares how he feels about blacks?  That's irrelevant.  It doesn't mean anything.  Elephant.  What did he say?  That he doesn't know if they were better off when they were slain. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, that was...  Oh, right.  We have that.  I'm sorry.  I do know this.  He's saying that basically because of the way a lot of them are on welfare and the way  the government...  This is a perfect smear campaign, though, of somebody that obviously is right-wing, is obviously  looking to defend himself against what he sees as an overreaching government.  And this is a great way for the liberals to fight back at him.  Now, he did say the comments.  Yes.  They didn't put the words in his mouth.  But again, they were taken out of context. 
[00:17:30]  Were they offensive?  Yeah.  Some people would say they're very offensive.  Others would say, this is just the way this guy talks.  What the fuck are you going to say?  Is he a racist?  Or was he just being completely honest?  He's saying that the government puts black people in a position of being subservient again.  When you put a bunch of black people in housing complexes and subsidize all of their income and make them completely dependent on the government, it does give this plantation mentality that goes down. 
[00:18:00]  And that's...  Was he eloquent saying it?  No, he's covered in cow shit, for the love of Christ.  Look at him.  I was so glad on Friday that we had the actual tape of what Clive and Bundy said.  Because Ant is a...  I mean, he's a genius of a guy.  And he's a great talker.  And he can convince you of pretty much anything.  Until you actually heard the words come out of Clive and Bundy's mouth.  Then it was a little different.  Well, maybe it's not just the language he's using, but the actual things he's literally saying. 
[00:18:30]  Let's listen to a little more from Clive and Bundy on Friday.  Semantics are one thing, but at certain times it's hard to trust a guy to lead a...  Like, let's just say, no matter how good a politician is...  Yeah.  If you walked into a room and you just saw him holding a log of shit and eating it, you'd probably go,  It's hard for me to listen to him on other issues.  Which is what Clive and Bundy is doing here. 
[00:19:00]  Holy shit.  Do you think he drops and bombs, that guy?  Nigra.  That was called a course correction.  Because he was like, let me tell you something about the Nigra.  Yes.  Can you play...  It sounds like he caught himself and he forgot there was a camera.  Wow.  That's him catching himself.  It's right off the bat here.  That's the real bad thing.  Listen.  This is his media voice.  Right.  This is him cleaned up.  I better check myself.  I'm aware cameras are in my face.  It's time to be charming and... 
[00:19:30]  I've got to be careful.  This type of speech should be videotaped from like a covert location, real far away, under  a desk.  The camera's right in his face.  Not only is it not covert, he actually...  Are we on?  Right, right, right.  And he quieted everyone down.  I've got something to say.  The Nigra.  I want to tell you one more thing.  Yeah, you really need...  Oh, sin.  That's as far back as it goes.  I'm spoiling it.  There is no farther back to God.  All right, let's go.  The Nigra.  I want to tell you one more thing.  Nigra.  The Nigra. 
[00:20:00]  Nigra.  What, aren't I?  He really came close.  Who says Nigro?  Nigro.  Nigra.  You're saying Nigra.  N-I-G.  There's no O in there.  Nigra.  Nigra.  Nigra.  Yeah, I don't think this is as much a case of the media trying to dissuade people from  his cause as it is, oh, we just realized this man is an ignorant buffoon.  Yeah, it's hard to...  Like, look, he can say what he wants.  He is just using his own honest point of view.  But it's really hard to defend a guy who says, I don't know if they were better off because 
[00:20:30]  they didn't get taught to pick cotton and plant their own turn...  Like, the way he's writing off, he's forgetting parts of slavery.  He's forgetting that slavery wasn't white people going, come on, family day, plant some  turnips and have a good time.  Right.  We're going to give you something to do if you want.  Right.  Are you bored?  Come here.  Here you go.  We're going free.  Right.  White people worked in the factory.  Black people were slaves, but we were all working.  That was what was important.  Yeah.  How benevolent of me to give you this entire field of cotton to run around in and have  fun.  He forgets that.  Do you get that he is speaking about black people as if they're a different species altogether? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  He kind of was.  Like, the ingrained superiority in everything that he says.  This guy.  He is amazing.  He's a hoot.  And the Donald Sterling story is so big.  People aren't even talking about Clive and Bundy anymore.  Well, Donald Sterling is not the only thing we're going to talk about today.  Real quick, let's go to Matt in Boston.  What's up, Matt?  Sammy.  How you doing, buddy?  Good, buddy.  Hey, did you guys actually play all the clips? 
[00:21:30]  Because there was another part where he was talking about Mexicans and their family values.  No, no, no.  He was talking to them in a positive light.  So, you know, he was comparing, like, the family dynamic with the Mexicans and how they  take care of each other.  And I'm not saying, I'm not justifying his comment, but it's not like the guy's just a  blatant racist.  No, I think he's a buffoon.  I think he's an idiot.  Now, I would say that whether positive or negative, I'm just not going to go to Clive and Bundy for my racial 
[00:22:00]  knowledge.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  I was reading an article and they were talking about him and they were saying that the guy's a complete victim of PR.  Like, the guy should never have been out there by himself.  He was lambasted.  I mean, yeah, he shouldn't have opened his mouth, but it's, I mean, he's the one who opened his mouth.  I'm not, he's not, he's a victim of himself.  He's an idiot.  Exactly.  Like, we don't put you on the Mexican border to talk about.  No.  Absolutely not.  But, you know, so, yeah, so I think, yeah, it's crazy, but, I mean, it was just interesting to me that he had two 
[00:22:30]  different viewpoints based on two different, you know, classes of people or races of people.  Very strange.  Thank you, man.  Although, I think if I was on the Mexican border, I would do a better job than Clive and Bundy.  That's just me.  I think I can handle it.  A little better.  Maybe not the best, but a little better.  However, aside from the whole Donald Sterling thing that we're going to get into, some tweets were going around over the weekend.  Some spoiler tweets, if you will. 
[00:23:00]  First of all, if you're following me on Twitter, you know that somebody has said that they will be calling me personally today.  And that's Lady Di.  Yes, Lady Di was tweeting me flirty tweets again over the weekend, and she is planning on calling in at some point today.  Whether her phone call gets picked up or not remains to be seen.  Also, this is the biggie.  There's a radio show that we were making fun of a lot last week.  We kind of ended on good terms. 
[00:23:30]  They apparently will be calling in today, later on this morning, Humble and Fred, call the Opie and Anthony show.  Amazing.  You talk about some of your all-time comebacks.  This thing lasted a week.  We started talking about them at the beginning of the week, and then on Friday, we played clips of them talking about us and gave our opinions.  Sal, let's play track three, our opinions of Humble and Fred's opinions on us.  That's very funny what they're describing. 
[00:24:00]  It's really funny.  Facts and faggots and racists.  A lot of racists.  A lot of racists.  I've seen some of those racist posts.  They're a hoot.  Yeah, like the black guy.  It's just inappropriate.  The black guy with the cat shirt.  The cat shirt, and then there's a cat with a shirt on, and well...  It's not very nice what it says.  Or the guy with the hose and the little African-American child on the lawn.  Oh, Beretta.  The fucking... 
[00:24:30]  What is it called, those little photos?  That's not a meme, is it?  A meme.  Does a meme move or no?  Sometimes.  Some of those things make me laugh so hard.  Yeah.  Oh, they're so vicious.  So bad.  I agree wholeheartedly with them.  Some of it is just vile, despicable stuff.  Yeah.  Sure came in this morning of guys having anal sex, and I think you're supposed to be one,  and I'm supposed to be the other.  Yeah, there was one funny one yesterday, though.  A guy was sort of like a fat guy, sort of had his arms around his legs, and it had the 
[00:25:00]  caption, this is Fred trying to blow himself.  It was pretty funny.  It was good.  This is a guy who says, good morning, humble and Fred.  I have a French exam in two hours, and I'd like you two facts.  Wish you good luck.  Thanks.  And then the racist stuff, somebody sends a picture, it's a picture of a turd, like a  human turd, with Obama's face at the top of it.  Oh, my God.  It's like, what's the point of sending us that? 
[00:25:30]  What's the point of sending us that?  Now this is funny.  Oh, God.  I love their delivery of this stuff.  Yeah, and I love that they can say this stuff, and they're actually saying anal sex.  Yeah.  They got the balls to just say it.  I don't know, man.  These guys are turning me the fuck around.  Yeah, absolutely.  They're turning me around with this.  So, we'll see if the turnaround continues.  Humble and Fred call in today on the Opie and Anthony show, and Jim was at Caroline's 
[00:26:00]  all weekend.  I'm being told there were some shenanigans that went down.  Of course, they were reported on Jim's Twitter.  Club Soda Kenny is here.  Hey, Sam, I saw somebody with a not Sam shirt at Caroline's.  I did, too.  I was there.  I saw them going in.  Yeah, you should sell those.  Yeah, that's how he got it.  How do you get them?  I'm not going to plug it.  Get out of here.  I mean, not Sam.com is the answer, but I'm not going to plug it. 
[00:26:30]  Oh.  It's about Opie and Anthony.  They're only starting in a few minutes.  Are you ready?  It's a nice shirt.  No, I appreciate that, Kenny.  But it's about Opie and Anthony right now.  It's got a good font.  Thank you.  Thought's important.  We'll see if Humble and Fred maintain on good ground.  I think they will.  They've learned something that Scorch never has.  Sometimes reaching out helps a lot.  We've been making fun of a guy named Scorch for years, just randomly.  He's a DJ, a radio DJ.  He used to work in Syracuse. 
[00:27:00]  I interned for him up there, but there was a connection.  I think Opie and Anthony worked with him in Boston for a little while.  Their careers have kind of run parallel for quite some time.  Unfortunately, Scorch has not been met with the success that Opie and Anthony has.  It's always a good show when we do a little Scorch audio.  We did that on Friday.  Let's listen to it, Sal.  Sex offenders.  You don't laugh at sex offenders.  57-year-old Charlie Price of Pitchfield, Massachusetts.  Scorch is probably watching the show right now. 
[00:27:30]  Thanks, Chucky.  We love you, man.  Probably not.  Hey, you know what?  If he's watching the show, we don't care what you do in your off time.  Just don't tell us about it.  Probably think of it.  That was kind of funny.  There's some kind of sex criminal guy, and Scorch is assuming he's watching the show,  and then he gives a little private shout-out.  And a thumbs-up.  Hey, what do you do on your own time?  In case you needed an extra thumb for the kid.  If you're a PFG TV fan, I don't care what you do.  You know what really happens.  Just don't tell us about it.  Right.  What really happened there was, as he was talking, he realized that he was just giving 
[00:28:00]  a thumbs-up to the sex offender.  To the sex offender.  And so he had to try to think of something to cover.  Covered his tracks.  He did a good job.  Because apparently everyone in Massachusetts...  He's good.  He thinks...  He's quick on his feet.  He's watching Weird News.  Weird dudes.  I totally zoned out.  Yeah.  Should we start over?  No.  Should we start over?  Much like the audience.  You think so?  I don't know.  Let's take a listen.  Let's hear a little more, though.  Weird news.  I can't get enough.  Let's listen.  Hill, Massachusetts.  Probably watching the show right now. 
[00:28:30]  Close to home.  Thanks, Chucky.  We love you, man.  We love you.  Hey, you know what?  If he's watching the show, we don't care what you do in your off time.  Just don't tell us about it.  Price.  A convicted sex offender been cited for disturbing the peace.  You'll like this.  I will.  He admitted to kissing and fondling a cardboard cutout of a woman.  I've never seen concepts so poorly handled.  I've never heard thoughts so horribly explored.  Yes.  This is good stuff. 
[00:29:00]  It's weird news.  He just points at them.  You don't like this.  And the guy's like, what?  What?  What do you got again?  Oh, watch out, you.  What do you got again?  It's like, why don't they expand on these things and talk about them a little bit?  Scorch.  Love that guy.  I went to see Jim at Caroline.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah, yeah, Kenny.  What sizes do the shirts come in?  Kenny, you got to get out of here.  You got to take a walk.  You got to.  I wish we had a Kenny to control the pre-show sometimes. 
[00:29:30]  Are there different colors?  No.  No, there's not different colors.  Let's go to Adam in Connecticut.  Adam.  Yeah, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  I just wanted to talk about this silver thing.  No, Sterling.  You guys are in the Clifters.  I mean, you guys are obviously a fucking racist asshole, but I mean, Jay-Z is part owner  of the Brooklyn Nets.  She belongs to that 5% group, which basically has a racist belief system of its own.  Excuse me.  Nobody really seems to care about that. 
[00:30:00]  He's talking about Jay-Z, but he's got all the facts wrong.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think that there's any tapes of Jay-Z asking people to not take photos  with white people on Instagram, but I'm sure the argument will be made.  We'll listen to it be made.  And today, on the Opie and Anthony Show, we'll talk everything Donald Sterling, humble and  Fred calling in, which means E-Rock's in heaven because it's a radio thing.  And when there's another radio show involved, Radio Rain Man Eric Nagel is there. 
[00:30:30]  And he's done a great job with this.  And stories from Norton's Caroline's Weekend.  I saw them at Caroline's over the weekend.  The show I saw was hilarious, but apparently I missed the best show.  Hopefully we'll get into that and a whole lot more when the Opie and Anthony Show begins.  Thank God that's right now. 
[00:31:00]  Thank God. 
[00:31:30]  Thank God. 
[00:32:00]  Thank God. 
[00:32:30]  Thank God. 
[00:33:00]  Thank God.  Thank God. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  The year is 1994.  From the murky banks of terrestrial radio, a new hope begins to rise.  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts.  People sure are listening. 
[00:34:30]  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting the greatest duo.  Opie! Opie!  Oh my God! It is beautiful!  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  A hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show.  The other show there is.  Through 55-gallon drums and wiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable. 
[00:35:00]  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  Bottle rockets and brow bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift off the...  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  I have a raging hard-on right now. 
[00:35:30]  Can I please put my dick in your dogs?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations,  it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:36:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  There we are.  Welcome aboard.  For another week of fine broadcasting.  Oh, my goodness, yes.  Oh, my goodness.  Wake the fuck up.  Yeah.  Have a little green tea.  Ooh.  That'll give you a little boost in the morning.  Not really.  No, huh?  I don't even know if there's caffeine in this.  Maybe a little bit, right?  I don't even know.  Wah, wah. 
[00:36:30]  Wah.  How was everyone's weekend?  Ducky.  Delightful.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  I went to a communion yesterday.  Oof.  Those are dull.  Strange.  Yeah.  I'm not a big organized religion guy, but so a little strange.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I don't believe.  Oh.  I don't know.  I'm not really sure where I'm at, but I know I don't really like the organized religion that much.  Yeah.  It certainly has qualities of being a cult when you're there. 
[00:37:00]  A little cultish?  Yes.  I don't know.  It was all right.  Did you recite along?  Oh, yeah.  I play along.  I can't do that.  I play along.  I can't do the whole talkie back.  Oh, really?  You know, the priest talks and then the people do the talkie back.  I figure...  I figure...  What could it hurt?  Did you laugh when you did the...  Our Father who art in heaven when the S's come up? 
[00:37:30]  It's like Chip.  Give us a...  Forgive us.  And forgive us.  We forgive those chists.  It's so annoying to me when it comes up.  It's like...  And forgive us.  We forgive those chists.  You just hear...  I guess the new thing in church, especially this church...  I've been to this particular church a bunch because it's my brother's church. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  So I go to all his religious things.  And all of a sudden, I'm preoccupied by my kid.  And all of a sudden...  I think it was that part.  The chists.  Yeah.  The chists.  And all of a sudden, this lady grabs my hand.  Oh, shit.  And it was kind of nice in a weird little way.  Really?  Yeah.  Get some.  But I guess everyone has to hold hands now in church.  When did that start?  That happened.  And I guess you're supposed to do it proper where you're like...  Lift your hands up like this while you're holding them? 
[00:38:30]  I don't like that.  That looks like that creepy fucking arena religion kooky cult.  But me and this woman, we were holding hands like we were on a date.  On the down low?  You had a nice warm hand.  I'm like, what is this about?  Nice little milf.  A little milf to my right.  Yeah.  I just grabbed my hand out of nowhere.  I was preoccupied.  So I was like, what the hell's going on?  What is this?  So, it was fine.  My brother was the godparent.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  And he's like, he's a pure scientist.  So.  He was just, that religion stuff is, poke him.  He wouldn't even go up and get the offering.  No, huh?  I'm like, you gotta go up and get the offering.  For the kid.  No cracker.  Gotta get the cracker for the kid.  Cracker.  If you're there to support the kid, you gotta go get the cracker.  Body of Christ.  And if you don't believe in anything, that's fine.  I mean, it's just a cracker at that point.  So, what is it gonna hurt?  It was fine.  The cardboard taste and whatever it is. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  I would probably start going back to church a little bit just because it gives you an hour  to just kind of, you know, think.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know where I'm at with all that stuff.  They treat it so reverently.  Those, those, um, those communion wafers.  Right.  And then all I think about is like, they should have that on how it's made.  Right.  And just watch them spitting out millions of these things.  Oh, God, yeah.  On a conveyor belt and, you know, all of a sudden it doesn't, it doesn't seem as holy  when it's fucking being boxed up and shipped out of fucking big, big cartons with styrofoam 
[00:40:00]  peanuts and.  I guess when you, you take the offering, you're supposed to like all start thinking about stuff  and praying.  Yeah.  My first thought was, wow, I think this might be gluten free.  I think, I think they went to gluten free.  Did they go to gluten free?  And it tasted a bit wheat, like a weedish.  Yeah.  So I don't know if they changed their recipe or not, but man, it was, uh, it was quite a  little, uh, delight.  I bet.  Oh, is that how they make them? 
[00:40:30]  They do.  They have a show.  Oh, look, there's like a nun doing it.  A nun though, yeah.  Oh, they make them like pancakes?  Come on.  No, they don't make them like pancakes.  That can't be.  There's millions of fucking people eating these things every, they just showed her making  a huge pancake.  I can get 4,500 hosts.  Hosts.  Look, it's in a mold.  There it is.  Oh, there's the mold.  What do they do with all that extra stuff?  Oh, that's a waste.  What about all that? 
[00:41:00]  They probably, they probably, I'm guessing they use it.  Oh, okay.  Do you think they snack on them when they're, come on, she's working the foot pedals to  do this.  What, they can't use electricity or something?  Something tells me this is, uh, not a big turnout.  Lots of 1,000 or lots of 500.  Oh, my God, this is.  Pretty soon, I'll have to get another.  So, I've got about, about 4,500 out of one stock here.  You think the boss comes in and yells every so often?  Come on, we need more of these fucking things.  She's not wearing any gloves.  Dumb boss.  Once they're cut, put into containers, they have to dry a little bit. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, look at all that body of Christ.  That's a lot of body of Christ.  Yeah, body of Christ in a blue fucking tub.  In a blue little fucking container, yeah.  You don't want to, you don't want to think the body of Christ is being mass produced like  this.  I thought, I actually, look, it looks like a little church.  I thought they were done, uh, by hand, very delicately.  Yeah.  The body of Christ is a mass production.  For Jesus to take and make it to himself. 
[00:42:00]  Jesus.  See that, it's just bread right now.  Yeah.  I guess they've got to say some of that there, what they call mumbo jumbo over it.  Okay.  And then, uh, make it holy.  Wow.  I was getting ready for my first communion.  But that woman right there?  Yeah.  And I asked him.  You can mock her all you want.  That woman is not stressed out whatsoever.  No, she's fucking very.  You see how she was just slowly going through her day and her job?  Very slowly.  She hasn't had a cock in her in quite a while.  That's true.  She's probably all right with that as well. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Maybe.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Some people are all right with that, actually.  Not for her.  Yeah, let's be honest.  Nuns were not known for being peaceful.  No, not in the...  In the schools.  Not in the day.  It'll give you a good smack.  And then, you know, and then you get the nice little first communion party.  That was nice.  Oh, yeah.  Running around yards.  You know.  Yeah, that's nice.  That makes some snacks.  Sure.  Not too many, though, for me.  Oh, well. 
[00:43:00]  I actually said no to dessert.  Wow, was that tough.  Whoa.  That is a tough thing to do.  Well, you had your cracker.  You can put it in your mind all day.  You can go, I am not going to eat any shitty stuff today.  And then you go to a party and you're like, okay, all right, look.  Oh, I like hummus.  Okay, hummus.  Oh, they got red peppers.  The red pepper and the hummus actually is really tasty.  Oh, they got fresh pineapple.  Okay, I'm good.  Right.  I could...  All right, I'll have a couple wheat thins, but I'll blow off the potato chips and the  cheese. 
[00:43:30]  I'm good.  I'm good.  Uh-huh.  And then the main meal comes out and, you know, it's like chicken parm and all that.  But I'm like, all right, I can scrape the cheese off because I'm really trying to eat  like ridiculously well.  And then the desserts come out and your brain just fails you.  It's delicious.  But I was able to hang in there yesterday.  Yeah.  Ninety-nine times before yesterday when the desserts come out, that's when I go, ah, fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't stop?  Why?  Why?  Why is it?  Why is that? 
[00:44:00]  And it was DQ ice cream cake.  Oh, yeah, huh?  The DQ makes a good ice cream cake.  I didn't touch it.  Oh, yeah.  But at that point, I started like shaking.  I'm like, let's just go home.  I'm going to break down.  And when I break down, it's not good.  I'll eat half the fucking cake.  How was your birthday?  It was good.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just hung out.  Some degenerate friends come over and, yeah, nothing big, you know, no big patty or nothing. 
[00:44:30]  No.  Just hanging out.  Nothing special.  My usual hangout in between watching TV or hanging out by the pool.  I post my, you know, racist rants on Twitter.  And that's pretty much my weekend.  Right.  A lot of subject matter this weekend.  Yes.  Yeah, we'll get into all that.  Of course, we will.  Good old Donald Sterling there. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  Good old Donald Sterling.  That's a good one.  Whoopsie.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's in Dutch.  He's in a bit of a jam.  Well.  Goddamn bitches can't keep their mouths shut.  How old is that?  Keep their tapes from fucking rolling.  He's 81 years old.  How old is she, though?  Oh, she can't be more than 35 tops.  His little chippy.  Little chippy.  Then what?  She hangs out with him, but she's allowed to do whatever the hell she wants.  Apparently.  As long as they're not black, I guess.  I don't know.  He seems to not mind if she fucks around. 
[00:45:30]  Look at him resting his hands on his big old belly.  That's an old school racist right there.  Yeah, living large.  There's no doubt about it, man.  Yeah, he is.  The one thing that is, I guess we can get into it.  The one thing that just bothers me about this whole thing is, you know, the Clippers should  have just not played.  Yeah?  Yeah.  If they had any balls at all, they would have not played the game.  They are not going to win the NBA championship.  No.  And they could have made a ridiculous statement by just not playing. 
[00:46:00]  I reckon.  Instead, they had some weird, silent protests where they had their warm-up jerseys on backwards.  Yeah.  And like Travis reminded me.  A crisscross?  The warm-up.  Yeah.  The warm-up.  They're not even televised.  No.  And I guess people applauded because they did that, but then they played the game for him.  Yeah.  For him.  It's his team in the end.  Plantation's got to run.  And then other teams are wearing black socks as silent protests? 
[00:46:30]  What?  I'm just saying, if you want to stand by what you believe, the move would have been not  to play the fucking game.  Yeah.  Period.  That would have made a major fucking statement.  Although then you're open for lawsuits and all that stuff because you're just letting  the fans down.  Yeah.  They would have figured it out in the end, though.  Yeah.  They would have figured it out in the end, the lawsuits and all that.  Because, I mean, they would have had overwhelming support if they just said, we're not playing  tonight.  Yeah.  We do not like what this guy said. 
[00:47:00]  What was his point?  I guess he doesn't like this chick bringing black people to his games.  On Saturday morning, TMZ posted.  We have the whole clip, right?  Or Sam working on it still?  On Saturday morning, TMZ posted a nine-minute audio clip of a private conversation.  Obviously, the private conversation thing is brutal.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  We all have private conversations that we certainly wouldn't want out there, obviously.  And he's so old, he probably had no idea why she kept holding her phone to his face. 
[00:47:30]  So how do you feel about her?  How do you feel about blacks?  Talk into this, could you?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll get you a juice.  Ah, shit.  Private conversation between Clippers owner Donald Sterling and his former girlfriend  V. Stiviano, it looks like, right?  Where he scolds her for appearing in public with black people, bringing them to Clippers  games, and posting photos of them online.  How dare she?  Isn't he, by the way, or his family suing her for $1.8 million because they're alleging 
[00:48:00]  that she embezzled money?  Oh, really?  Yeah, there's a lawsuit.  So this was a revenge release, which I have a big problem with.  Look, the guy's a hunk of shit, we know that.  But it's like revenge porn.  Right.  You know what I mean?  When you're taking this private moment with somebody.  Right.  And look, the guy's a scumbag.  But first of all, most of the owners are scumbags.  Look at the way they treat the players with concussions in the NFL.  Right.  I don't think any of them are good guys, or most of them, maybe Mark Cuban and a couple  other ones, but most of them are kind of just old school, self-centered shits. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  You know, they don't look at him as like human beings for the most part.  But who cares what he's like in his private life?  Because wasn't he, wasn't he, he was about to get an award from the NAACP, a second award.  Yeah.  So that means he must have at least been behaving a certain way.  Sure.  If he wasn't, then the NAACP is fucked up.  What was he going to get the award for?  Lifetime achievement.  For what?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  It was, uh...  I guess for feeding and clothing black people, like he says in the next statement.  Shouldn't we have that right away?  I heard it on, uh, 1010 Wins. 
[00:49:00]  Uh, let's see.  Post some photos of them online.  I'm on Sunday.  Okay.  Uh, in a statement to TMZ on Saturday, Sterling and the Clippers questioned whether the audio  was doctored.  It's him.  Of course.  Oh, they're just, sounds like it.  They're wondering if it's edited a little bit.  You can make a couple of nice little edits.  Has, have they said, uh, Sterling's, uh, reputation tarnished yet?  Has that been used?  Not yet.  Can you wait, please?  Sterling, tarnished?  No?  Yeah, but I'm happy you knocked your water off when you said that.  Yeah, but I keep my cap on, Jimmy.  You're smarter than I am, I know. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, it's my camp.  I always do with coffee.  They said Sterling is definitely not a racist and that the tape does not reflect his beliefs  and that it is the antithesis of who he is.  The statement continues to say, we do know that the woman on the tape who we believe released  it to TMZ is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family, alleging that she embezzled  more than 1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would get even.  I'll tell you what hurts him on this tape is he says things like, uh, you know, um, 
[00:50:00]  uh, oh shit, I just lost my thought.  It had something to do with her.  Oh, where he says to her, like, you look like a nice young white girl or Latina girl.  Like, he was probably trying to pass her off.  Right.  As, like, white or Latin.  And I'm looking at the photos.  Right.  And here's what bothers this guy.  It's that his young hot chick is putting her, like, fingers up in the peace sign.  And it's like, culturally, she just looks like she's this young, uh, chick hanging out with  these black guys, and his old school white friends don't like it.  Sure.  Who the fuck are his awful friends calling and saying, uh... 
[00:50:30]  Oh, wait, she's calling me now.  Hold on.  It's awful.  But who are his friends calling him and going, yeah, she's on Instagram with blacks.  Like, first of all, why are your creepy friends following your chick on Instagram?  I have a real problem with the privacy angle, though, even though I do agree that the guy's  a fucking creep.  And I do think he's a racist.  You just gotta...  I agree with you, but, I mean, the culture we live in, there's many examples of this  before Donald Sterling.  It's true.  God, after Mel Gibson, you would think everyone would just shut the fuck up and not say a 
[00:51:00]  word on the phone.  But is that what we want?  Like, do we want that?  Oh, no, but I'm just saying, you gotta watch your own back in the end.  Of course we don't want that, but it's here to stay.  Just the way no one is coming out, because what he said was so...  You know, it's kind of shitty what he said.  It was really shitty.  No one is coming out and talking about the privacy stuff.  Right.  And it's like, that to me is the greatest...  We're all victims of that.  Because it's too late.  Our privacy is going away, and there's nothing any of us could do about it at this point.  I hate to say that, but it's the truth. 
[00:51:30]  How do you push all that back?  How do you do it?  I just hate this one-sided bullshit that always happens with the media and this outrage.  You know, there's so many examples of both sides just being assholes and racists, even  though I've been told black people can't be racist.  That's an amazing statement that people actually still adhere to.  Jay-Z wearing that goddamn medallion that represents an organization that despises white people. 
[00:52:00]  Calls them the devil.  But, you know, there's nothing on that.  I mean, why don't the Chicago Bulls protest the fact that there's no concerted effort being  made to keep over 100 people being shot in Chicago over the past two weekends.  Like, that's real substantial problems happening to black people.  This guy, sure, he's an asshole, racist, whatever. 
[00:52:30]  But, in essence, it's, you know, one idiot's opinion of other people.  And, again, how old is this guy?  80.  81.  How come, you know, we've discussed this, Jim, when you talk about, well, the culture that  black people have been grown up in over the past decades and generations, you still have  that subtle racism and hatred in the black community for what they had to go through. 
[00:53:00]  And that's how they were raised.  And until that goes away, it's very hard to move on.  Well, people like that rancher out in Nevada and this guy Sterling, they were raised in  a culture where it's acceptable to speak like this.  And I'm not saying it's right, just as I'm not saying it's right for, you know, blacks  to use their past as an excuse for future shortcomings.  But, again, it's never looked at like, well, we just got to look where it comes from. 
[00:53:30]  This guy's 80 years old.  He was raised in this environment.  And until these people are dead, pretty much, you're going to have this.  It's always looked at as a great excuse for black people to say that that's why their  culture has certain shortcomings.  But when white people do it, and it's based on their past and their ideology, it's terrible.  They must be shunned and exiled.  I think that's why this guy's like that.  He's an old school guy.  I'm not saying he's right. 
[00:54:00]  And when you're over 80, first of all, first of all, I understand why black players would  want to play for him.  Like, I get why black people are fucking, because the NBA is, you know, most of the players are  black.  And Obama said that he's steeped in black culture.  He's right.  It's kind of hard to have one of the owners coming out and saying that.  Like, that's a brutal fucking thing.  But there's not much they're going to be able to do, though.  No, they can't take the team from him as much as people like it.  Like, the NBA can fine him, I guess, and suspend him, whatever that would be.  Can they suspend him, though? 
[00:54:30]  I don't even know.  What's the charge?  Well, first of all, their constitution is secret.  The NBA's constitution among owners is private.  Yeah, that's a secret.  What they can do, the only way they can take his team or force him to sell it, or sell  like, out from under him, is if there's financial misgiving.  Like, if he can't pay his bills.  That's all they give a shit about.  But you can't be forced out.  He's pretty much untouchable.  He's almost untouchable.  That's why, if the team really wants to get something done, they're going to have to  do something drastic in the end.  Here's what's going to happen. 
[00:55:00]  He will not sell the team because of his family.  He wants his family to keep the team.  He will step away, and he will make somebody else the acting owner.  I hope he has sons or something.  He will say, look, I am completely washing my hands of the team.  I will have no further dealings with the team.  And his son or whoever it is will take it.  So, new owner, David Duke.  Yeah.  But I think that's how he's going to handle it.  That's if the pressure gets too much.  I don't know.  I mean, the president mentions it.  That's bad.  But having a team just, you know, reverse their warm-up jerseys or put black socks on, 
[00:55:30]  that's not going to get it done.  Yeah.  He's laughing at that.  Oh, he probably was thinking, oh, that's cute.  Yeah, yeah.  That's cute.  We got the audio, though.  Let's go through this.  Cool.  This is a big thing, though, man.  Obama mentioning it makes it a fucking massive...  When the president of the United States is saying, David Silber's a good man, he'll  look at that.  That puts a lot of pressure on the NBA commissioner.  Yeah, you don't want Obama on your radar ever.  No, especially when he's talking highly about you as the commissioner, because you're  like, Obama's saying nice things about me.  Oh, I've got to do something.  Ignorant.  Incredibly offensive. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Most people have only heard just clips on the news.  We've got the whole thing here, so why don't we go through this?  It's about nine minutes, and we'll certainly be stopping along the way.  It was an hour conversation, I think, too.  There was a second tape for five minutes, which I heard.  One, two, three, four, five, six...  Yeah, we're talking about nine.  Oh, okay.  Almost ten minutes we got.  I don't do anything wrong.  If we ever have any issues, it's because people call you and tell you things about me that  are not true.  What's wrong with you broadcasting?  I'm not broadcasting anything.  Anything.  With minorities.  Why?  What's wrong with minorities? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, boy.  What's wrong with black people?  Nothing.  Nothing.  She's dating him.  I'm talking to an enemy.  There's nothing wrong with minorities.  They're fabulous.  Fabulous.  Because you're an enemy to me.  Why?  Because you don't understand.  I don't understand what?  Nothing.  That racism?  Oh, she's trying so hard.  No, there's a hope.  Yeah, I see.  This is so obvious that...  Now, obviously, he did say what he said, but she knows.  She's probably heard it before, you know, in the house. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, she just needs it on tape.  Right, she needs it on tape.  It's not coming from nowhere, obviously.  She has her agenda.  She's trying to get back at him.  She knows that he's probably...  I don't know for sure, but he's probably said horrendous things.  So now she just needs a little of that on tape.  You could set him up.  She knows the key words to set him off.  Minority.  Racism.  Right, right.  There's a culture.  White people steal certain things.  Because black people steal certain things towards black. 
[00:57:30]  Black people steal certain things towards other groups.  It's been that way historically, and it will always be that way.  But it's not that way in my heart and in my mind.  But maybe you want to adjust to the world.  So why?  The world doesn't do anything for me, and they don't make me happy.  You're right.  I don't want to argue with you.  I don't want to argue.  I can't be racist in my heart.  And that's good.  I'm living in a culture, and I have to live within the culture. 
[00:58:00]  But even though she is baiting him completely, the things she's saying are not so crazy.  It's like she's kind of throwing softballs out there, and man, he's cranking up and hitting  him out of the park.  He's nailing him, yeah.  Yeah, because things like you've got to adjust to the culture.  It's like, yeah, you're a billionaire.  You own the team.  Shut the fuck up.  He probably hates having to stand there and listen to people talking, black culture. 
[00:58:30]  He probably hates watching and, oh, look, black culture.  I don't know.  You don't think?  No.  I really think it has something to do with he's an embarrassed old man who's got his  hot young girlfriend taking these Instagram pictures with these much younger and obviously  much more relevant people.  Yeah.  And he's just this fucking, it feels like this doddering sugar daddy, which is what he  is.  Yes.  Right.  Just a doddering sugar daddy.  Doddering sugar daddy.  Oh, that's bad.  People call you and tell you that I have black people on my Instagram, and it bothers you. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black  people.  You'll have to.  You'll associate with black people.  I'm not you, and you're not me.  You're supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate Latina girl.  I'm a mixed girl.  Right there.  Whoops.  That is really tough to spin. 
[00:59:30]  You're supposed to be.  Yeah.  Does he understand how you're talking to a half black girl?  Like, that shows you how fucking out of touch with any real stuff this guy is.  Yeah.  You're saying this to a half black girl.  Mm-hmm.  Wow, that's tough.  That's a rough one, man.  And you're in love with me.  And I'm black and Mexican, whether you like it or not, whether the world accepts it or  not.  And you're asking me to remove something that's part of me and in my bloodstream because 
[01:00:00]  the world seems different as me and you're afraid of what they're going to think because  of your upbringing.  You want me to have hate towards black people?  I don't want you to have hate.  That's what people do.  They turn things around.  I want you to love them privately in your whole life.  Every day you could be with them.  Every single day of your life.  But they're not in public.  But why publicize it on the Instagram and why bring it to my games? 
[01:00:30]  That's because he has to answer to his friends, little buddies.  Oh, that's what that's all about.  That's what that's about.  What's going on with your girl there?  Right, exactly.  So I'm hanging out with some of those and insert epithet here.  You want to talk about a white privileged existence?  81-year-old guy probably has a lot of white privileged friends.  Yeah, so who are you?  First of all, you're the owner of an NBA team.  And it's not like she's bringing in street fans.  It's like she's a player.  Like Magic Johnson.  I don't know. 
[01:01:00]  He's kind of royalty in the NBA.  Yeah.  And you're mad she's snapping a photo.  That to me was like...  Yeah, it was the Magic Johnson photo.  Yeah, that was when I set him off.  Like the final one.  He is royalty in the NBA.  Yeah, and she's not going to fuck the guy.  Everyone knows he's HIV positive.  It's like he's the last guy that you should be embarrassed about.  Really weird.  Really weird take this guy.  I mean, Magic Johnson probably could be the, if you think that way, the safest black guy  to have a picture with.  Yeah, because every girl knows.  If that's where your mindset is. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  It could get a lot worse if you look at some of these guys.  Oh, yeah.  If that's your mindset.  I think she should be able to take a picture with whoever the fuck she wants.  Yeah, I don't know why this guy...  Don't bring him to my games.  It's like, if there's one place your girlfriend is not going to look bad, hanging out with  a black athlete, it's in the NBA when you're the owner.  Basketball game.  Yeah, the owner.  He really is.  This guy is kind of awful, man.  And it's what, 70% black, I think, the NBA players.  And that number used to be higher, I do believe. 
[01:02:00]  I thought it was higher, yeah.  It's one of the...  In playing the jury, you know, they say what's going to happen.  I saw an interesting analysis of this, and it made sense.  Is in the offseason, this will be...  Like, the other players...  He said, because right now the team is playing against this team, and they have to win games.  Right.  And he's like, you know, look, when you're trying to win games, you take whatever misfortune  the other team's having, and you try to capitalize, because you want to win the series.  Yeah.  But in the offseason...  Well, they're playing the Warriors, and they're tied at two right now, so...  They lost last night.  Warriors! 
[01:02:30]  But they would have...  I mean, they should have lost on purpose.  They should have, like, not played.  Yeah.  It's hard to say, because when your stats come out at the end of your career, like, all  this is just a terrible memory.  When you think about it, the owner said bad things to his girlfriend in private.  But they...  That doesn't excuse not playing.  Yeah.  But they feel strongly, you know, that he needs to go.  So, you know.  Force your hand.  Shouldn't...  Because people say he was also, like, a known racist before.  Then it's two things.  Why the hell was the NAACP going to honor this guy if he was a known racist? 
[01:03:00]  Most improved?  You know what?  I don't know.  I'm like that.  Most improved statue?  Yeah.  But I could see...  He'll have a...  You know, I get why black guys don't want to play with this guy, and I think that a  lot of people will be asking to be traded.  Right.  And he will not be able to sign any other black...  Right.  Probably a lot of guys will ask to, yeah, leave the team.  Yeah.  Unless something changes.  Just have a white team.  It'll look like the 50s.  Yeah, the 0-82.  He tweeted that.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  But if he steps down and just gives it to one of his family members, I don't even think  that's good enough for a lot of these players.  Yeah.  They probably want the whole family out of it.  Right.  But that ain't gonna happen.  No, they can't.  Let's continue with the tape.  I'm sorry that you still have people around you that are full of racism and hate in their  hearts.  I'm sorry that you're still racist in your heart.  I'm sorry that you live in a world that still...  How about your whole life, every day, you could do whatever you want.  You could sleep with them.  You could bring them in.  You could do whatever you want. 
[01:04:00]  The little I ask you is not to promote it on that and not to bring them to my game.  I don't bring anyone to the game.  Okay, then.  There's nothing to argue about it.  I mean, no.  Okay, we've got a big problem here.  I really don't feel like going anywhere.  I don't feel like going to Europe.  I don't feel like...  I don't feel like going to Europe.  What did you say to me in there?  I think it was one that was inaudible, and that might have been the inaudible moment. 
[01:04:30]  I don't even feel like going to Europe now.  Why is he so sad?  Because, you know, his chick is giving him some shit, bringing black people around.  I think he's also realizing this is his world and her world are beyond repair.  Plus, she was taken, you know, or alleged.  I shouldn't say she was taken.  I don't know if she was or not.  But there was allegations that she took money or embezzled.  Well, I wonder, why didn't she just...  Maybe he didn't understand how damaging this...  Did she go to him with this?  Like, if his family, I think, is going after her for money, did they talk about this? 
[01:05:00]  Did she go, like, look, this is what I'm going to release unless you've dropped a lawsuit?  Or is that considered blackmail and you can't do it?  Yeah, there's a little bit of blackmail there.  And, boy, he don't like blackmail.  For sure.  I don't understand how you can have so much hate towards minorities.  I don't have any hate on nothing.  I cannot understand...  Why would you say that?  ...how a person like you who's elevated, who's here, still feels above the world,  and you can't even be seen with someone in which is considered of a different skin color. 
[01:05:30]  They might be with me all day long and all night long.  I can't believe that a man who's educated, a man who's a scholar, a man who's great...  Well, believe it and stop talking about it.  Let's finish our discussion with a period, okay?  You're not making any good points.  You can't believe this man.  That's all I am.  I'm not a good person in your eyes.  If I was a good person, you wouldn't say, I can't believe this.  I can't believe that.  What am I...  But you're all lying.  I love this lie. 
[01:06:00]  Look at all those negatives that are coming from...  There's no negativity.  I love everybody.  I'm just saying, in your lousy Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself walking with black people.  You don't have to.  If you want to, do it.  If it's white people, it's okay?  If it was Larry Bird, would it help me to differ?  You're just a big fighter. 
[01:06:30]  I can see.  Who would want to live with a woman like you?  Who would want to live with a woman?  All you ever wanted to do was fight.  You're a born fighter.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here we go.  You know why.  She's a born fighter.  Knockout game fucker.  She's not even being, in this discussion at least, she's not being, she's not yelling and screaming,  and she's making fairly good points.  She's baiting him, though.  It's obvious.  But he's so used to people doing everything he says to do, because he's a billionaire who owns a fucking team, 
[01:07:00]  that even this level of argument is considered outrageous to him.  Right.  Right.  I'm going to end this with a period.  Done.  Yeah, he said that in the boardroom before.  We're ending this with a period.  I'm like, okay, sir, okay.  All right.  Harumph.  I didn't get a harumph out of you.  Not her with her great ass.  She's like, what if it was Larry Bird, old man?  I saw someone I admire.  I admire Magic Johnson.  Okay, good.  I'm sorry.  He's made a lot of changes for his community, for the world, for the people, for the minority. 
[01:07:30]  He's helped a lot of people.  Why are you forcing this out of my throat?  I'm finished talking to you.  I have nothing more to say.  And I said, the picture was someone I admired.  Good.  And he happens to be black, and I'm sorry.  I think it's nice that you admire him.  I know him well, and he should be admired.  And I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately.  And during your entire f***ing life, your whole life, admire him, bring him here, feed him, f*** him. 
[01:08:00]  I don't care.  You can do anything.  But don't put him on Instagram for the world to see, so they have to call me.  And don't bring him into my games, okay?  You know, if you want your girlfriend to f*** Magic Johnson more than Instagram and picture it, that's a bad message to send.  The guy's got some weird f***ing priorities.  Yeah, but he's 81 by the time anything takes hold.  That's a great point.  But it's Magic Johnson he has a problem with. 
[01:08:30]  Her taking a picture with Magic Johnson.  He don't care.  Magic Johnson's pretty much a nerd.  But he doesn't care, because, you know, to him, he's around ballplayers all the time.  It's Magic Johnson.  He's not...  Most would put Magic Johnson on their top ten list of greatest NBA players of all time.  Easily.  He's not impressed by good basketball players.  He's around that all the time.  So Magic Johnson, to him, is just another black guy that's with his chick that he doesn't want. 
[01:09:00]  Magic Johnson is the top of the top.  Yeah.  He doesn't want any.  I don't...  I've never thought...  I don't know him personally.  Please leave me alone.  Please.  Please.  But, look, look, haven't...  Guys, we can all agree we've all been there, huh?  Just please.  Please, leave me alone.  Regardless of what the argument's about...  Leave me alone.  Haven't we all been where we're just like, please, please, stop it, shut up, I've had it. 
[01:09:30]  Women have all the power.  Oh.  Especially in those situations.  She's driving this guy nuts.  They could tie you up for hours.  Jesus.  Where you just...  We'll just say stupid shit, because you're just completely exhausted.  Shut up.  All right, all right.  I want to hear that again.  All right.  Here is please, please.  His voice is shaking.  You're hearing a billionaire sound.  Begging.  Sound a lot like most of us.  Because of that fucking pocket between our legs. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  And I don't mean the racist comments, of course.  I mean...  Yeah.  Just begging for your woman to leave you the fuck alone.  Please.  I'm sorry.  Oh, wait.  I didn't go back far enough.  Hold on a minute here.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Personally.  Please leave me alone.  Please.  Please.  I'm sorry.  Is there anything that I can do to make you feel better? 
[01:10:30]  No.  You can never make me feel better.  You're just a fighter.  You want to fight.  Fighter.  A fighter.  I was a fighter.  A Navy SEAL.  I don't want to fight with you.  I guess this is another phone call.  Yeah.  The quality is different.  I don't know if these are a phone call.  Oh, no.  They're in person.  I'm in person.  Guaranteed.  But this is the second tape.  How did she tape them?  Probably with her iPhone or something, right?  Yeah.  I'm sure.  You put that phone down.  He doesn't know what the fuck that is.  Or a microphone.  She just held a microphone in his dumb face.  What is that? 
[01:11:00]  I don't want to fight with you.  Of course you do.  You love to fight.  I don't fight.  That's all you do.  You fight with everybody.  I'm sorry you feel that way, honey.  I don't know how this conversation even came about.  You were telling me how people called you.  and how they mentioned certain things to you and how it bothers you.  Can't you say a few Instagrams? 
[01:11:30]  I won't.  I'll just.  Here you go, honey.  A little bit of juice, baby.  A little bit of juice for you, honey.  A little bit of juice for you, honey.  A little bit of juice for you, honey.  A little bit of juice for you, honey.  Honey, if it makes you happy, I will remove all of the black people from my Instagram.  I like my Yankee bean.  You said I understand.  What?  What do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think she put in his juice?  Probably Saul Peters.  We can't.  Fuck him.  Some truth serum. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, God.  Have some juice.  Have some juice.  I just pictured her giving him like a little juicy pack with a straw in his pop.  Have your juice.  Fucking doddering sugar, honey.  Drink this while Allen Iverson comes in my hair.  You know what's funny is that she goes, I'll take all the black people on my Instagram.  And like right there is an opportunity for him to go, look, that's not what I'm saying.  But he goes, well, you said you would do that before.  Like there's no, she's giving him so much room to back out and he just won't back out. 
[01:12:30]  I would love to know who's giving Donald Sterling shit.  Oh, my God.  This sounds a lot like some of his boys, his pals there are giving him a lot of shit.  Yeah, he's got some good old boys.  And he doesn't want to deal with all that crap when he goes to dinner and hangs out with them.  Yeah.  You said that before.  You said I understand.  I did remove the people that were independently on my Instagram that are black.  Then why did you start saying that you didn't? 
[01:13:00]  You just said you didn't remove them.  You didn't remove them.  I didn't remove Matt Kemp and Magic Johnson.  Why?  But I thought Matt Kemp is mixed.  And he was okay, just like me.  You have a little...  He's lighter and whiter than me.  I met his mother.  He's got a little fucking, like, paint chips on a piece of paper.  And it's like, all right, they've got to be lighter than this.  Right, right.  He's got to look at it.  Yeah, but Matt Kemp is eggshell. 
[01:13:30]  Is he okay?  Yes, is that okay?  He's Battleship Gray.  I don't want him on your Instagram.  Yeah.  Yeah, like you're looking at paints for your room.  Yeah.  That's a little dark.  That's a little dark.  I don't know.  I want it lighter than this right here.  Yeah, we'll get to what Magic Johnson had to say.  Oh, everyone's saying stuff.  We've got the Obama thing.  Oh, boy, this is very bad for this guy.  You might want to tell Humble and Fred that we're going to be a little late for their phone call.  Oh, man.  I hope it doesn't ruin their morning.  And how long...  By the way, is this the first time the Clippers have been in the playoffs in a long time? 
[01:14:00]  I have not...  I really don't know.  They've had a pretty shitty team for many, many, many years.  But I'm not positive about that point.  Is this the best they've had in a while?  Yeah, they've got a pretty good team these days.  You know how mad at her he must be?  So, yeah.  You think I'm a racist...  They don't have a shot at winning the championship, though.  I just want to make that point.  Thank you.  You think I'm a racist...  I don't think you're a racist.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  I think you...  Evil heart. 
[01:14:30]  I don't think so.  I think you have an amazing heart, honey.  I think the people around you have poised in mind and have a way of thinking.  It's the world.  You go to Israel.  The blacks are just treated like dogs.  So do you have to treat them like that, too?  The white Jews...  There's white Jews or black Jews.  Do you understand?  And are the black Jews less than the white Jews?  A hundred percent.  Fifty.  A hundred percent.  And is that right?  It is the question. 
[01:15:00]  We don't evaluate what's right and wrong.  We live in a society.  We live in a culture.  We have to live within that culture.  But shouldn't we take a stand for what's wrong and be the change and the difference?  I don't want to change the culture because I can't.  It's too big.  But you can change yourself.  I don't want to change it.  My girl can't do what I want.  I don't want the girl.  I'll find a girl that will do what I want. 
[01:15:30]  Believe me.  I thought you were that girl.  Because I try to do what you want.  But you're not that girl.  No blacks, that girl.  This guy's in Dutch.  He's having a 17-year-old boy discussion at age 81.  At 81.  I thought you were that girl.  Wow.  You own a team.  You're talking like a little child.  Your friend told me.  Yeah.  Do you like like me?  And by the way, this whole culture thing and you can't change the culture.  Try fucking weaseling some of this guy's money. 
[01:16:00]  And watch how fast.  Like, hey, that's just the world we live in.  I wonder if he says that when it's time to pay taxes.  No.  He doesn't go, that's the world we live in.  He goes, well, fuck this.  We're not doing it.  Fight this and change that.  Just stop.  Come on.  He fights at every turn.  Yeah.  And now the next clip.  This is the one in the final clip for today.  That's going everywhere this morning.  Relatively a newer clip.  I wasn't raised the way you were raised.  Well, then, if you don't feel, don't come to my games. 
[01:16:30]  Don't bring black people.  Don't come.  Do you know that you have a whole team that's black, that plays for you?  Do I don't?  I support them and give them food and clothes and cars and houses.  Who gives it to them?  Does someone else give it to them?  I love it.  Do I know that I have?  So, who makes the game?  Do I make the game or do they make the game?  And these are 30 owners that created the league?  I'm not going to bring any black people to the stadium. 
[01:17:00]  Well, is it easy to say that?  It's very easy for you to say that.  For you to say that?  I won't say that to anyone.  I would never ask anyone not to bring someone based on race or color or culture.  It's like saying, like, let's just persecute and kill all of the Jews.  Oh, it's the same thing, right?  Well, isn't it wrong?  Wasn't it wrong then with the Holocaust?  And you're Jewish.  You understand discrimination? 
[01:17:30]  You're really a mental case.  There's a Holocaust for comparing with...  Racism.  Discrimination.  There's no racism here.  If you don't want to be walking into a basketball game with a certain person, is that racism?  Yes, it is.  I believe so, sir.  Oh, my God.  Didn't Patrice say so brilliantly, I've never met a racist?  Like, no one ever says they're a racist? 
[01:18:00]  Right, right.  And how can this guy say this and really not think that he's being racist?  Like, that's really, like, delusional.  That's very racist.  Patrice said my racism was charming.  Yeah.  The one place...  That was hilarious.  Because your racism is charming.  The one place you should be safe to bring a black person is to a basketball game.  Crazy.  If you think in that way...  Oh, my God.  This guy's great.  Holy shit, is he just... 
[01:18:30]  Now, if you bring a black person to a polo match, I would understand.  Now, there's a problem.  But an NBA game?  Yeah, I could see if he was having, like, a cotillion and she was bringing Lil Wayne.  Right.  Is that the right word, cotillion?  A cotillion.  Oh, thank God.  But he is bothered that she brings black...  To the debutante ball.  Black guys to an NBA game?  Yeah.  That's craziness.  See, there's the warm-up jerseys.  That does nothing.  No.  You're still playing for him. 
[01:19:00]  See, they put all...  Ah, whatever.  The statement they're making, though, it's really hard to say, don't play the game.  That's a rough one.  Yeah, but you know what?  That would be amazing if they did that.  Cutting off your nose to spite your face.  No, most of these guys would be completely fine in the end.  Most of them, yes.  This taps into that slave master mentality, too.  Like, well, he's got a black girlfriend and he lords...  I mean, of course, there's millions of dollars being paid, but it's just the mentality. 
[01:19:30]  He got a black belly warmer.  Yeah.  It's okay.  That's what it feels like.  It's just a silly protest, though, to turn your warm-up jerseys inside out and wear black socks.  That's just silly.  Yeah.  That's not really making...  I'm wearing black socks in support today.  Yeah.  The NBA is investigating, of course, and ESPN reported that a decision should come by Tuesday before the Clippers play.  I don't know what kind of decision they could come up with.  I don't know what they could do.  We'll see, though.  Sterling's estranged wife told TMZ that her family is devastated by the racial comments made by my estranged husband 
[01:20:00]  and said that she and her kids do not share his despicable views or prejudices.  It's despicable.  That's a really awful place for the family to be in, too.  You know, they just...  They probably love the Clippers.  Right.  Shitty Clippers.  All these years, they have to tolerate the Lakers next door being the Lakers, and they're the shit Clippers.  And then one year, they do good.  Dummy can't get his dick out of a 35-year-old, and he gets caught on tape saying,  Blackstone shouldn't come to my games. 
[01:20:30]  Do you know how everyone in the family is probably rooting for him to die already?  Enough of this guy.  Oh, the Blazers and Rockets both joined the Clippers in wearing black socks as a silent protest.  I just think that's cute.  That ain't doing shit horrible.  Ain't gonna do shit.  President Obama said...  We got the President Obama, right?  President Obama.  President Obama got involved.  He did.  Yes, he did.  I don't think I have to interpret those statements for you.  They kind of speak for themselves. 
[01:21:00]  And when people...  When ignorant folks want an advertiser...  What I hate about Obama, he cannot talk off-script.  No.  And when he made that amazing speech back before he was president, people were like,  Holy crap, this guy's an amazing speaker.  Uh-huh.  But as soon as he has to just use his own brain with nothing in front of him, he just humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a, 
[01:21:30]  and it takes forever to find some kind of groove and find his place.  A lot of gaps, a lot of delays.  What is that about?  Yeah.  Do these guys just get so accustomed to just having everything in front of them that they  lose that muscle or something?  It's got to be because in this day and age, you say one bad fucking word, one wrong thing  that isn't completely calculated and thought out, that's what they're playing on the news  for a week and ripping apart.  And for him to give an honest opinion on something is extremely rare because most times you do 
[01:22:00]  have time to get your writers to get you something written all nice and stuff.  I think they're just trying to get their thoughts out clearly, like you said, without one misstep  verbally because, man, you do.  It's all soundbites now.  He says one thing wrong.  Even if he reverses it in a few seconds, they still play the one thing you said wrong.  Oh, yeah.  Go back slightly.  So it takes Obama a little bit to get something going here.  I thought, I think, when ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't 
[01:22:30]  really have to do anything.  You just let them talk.  And that's what happened here.  I have confidence that the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, a good man, will address this.  Sterling is silver.  The NBA is a league that is beloved by fans all across the country.  It's got an awful lot of African-American players. 
[01:23:00]  It's steeped in African-American culture.  And I suspect that the NBA is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this.  I will make just one larger comment about this.  You know, we – the United States continues to wrestle with a legacy of race and slavery  and segregation that's still there.  We've made enormous strides, but, you know, you're going to continue to see this percolate 
[01:23:30]  up every so often.  And I think that we just have to be clear and steady in denouncing it, teaching our children  differently, but also remaining hopeful that part of – part of why some statements like  this stand out so much is because there have been a shift – there has been this shift 
[01:24:00]  in how –  People keep their mouths shut.  We do ourselves.  Don't actually say it.  All right.  You can think it, but don't say it.  All right.  And Magic Johnson said – we have his clip, too.  The president comments.  I don't have to say what he said.  He's in fucking Malaysia, and the president has to comment on your fucking rant.  It's a small world these days.  And it's also –  The Malaysian guy was standing there all awkward. 
[01:24:30]  What is this about?  He doesn't even know what he's saying.  We still can't find a plane.  Fuck.  What does this have to do with our plane?  With our plane.  He's so NBA-oriented, though, Obama.  Like, he's aligned himself with the NBA, and he kind of almost – I was like, why  the fuck's a president talking about this?  But he's like, all right, I kind of get it.  Well, any race thing that comes up, though, usually.  Yeah.  But Obama's basketball skills frustrate the hell out of me.  I was brought up with the game, and he stinks.  Are you saying that as a black guy, he should be better, Opie?  Because, you know –  Well, the press and everyone else likes to make believe he's really good at basketball. 
[01:25:00]  He stinks.  Do you understand how bad he is at basketball?  Oh, my God.  So he's bad for a black guy, but he's good for a Harvard graduate.  He's horrible no matter who you are.  He is really bad at basketball.  What president was good?  I bet LBJ was pretty good.  He was a tall drink of water, wasn't he?  Yeah, probably.  He probably could get up there and just – you just dipsy-doodle a little –  Dipsy-doodle it right in.  I'll tell you who wasn't very good – oh, please get it right – FDR. 
[01:25:30]  I'll bet you that Abe Lincoln was good.  Abe Lincoln, probably good.  With the people he hung around with.  He had a good layup.  He would just put it on top of his stovepipe hat.  Right.  Dip it in.  We played the one clip of – there's so many bad Obama basketball clips online, by the way.  Yeah.  It's not just one, but what was that one we saw where he just literally cannot – he couldn't make the shot?  He couldn't sink it for nothing.  Do you remember?  You remember?  Can you find it really fast?  He is horrible. 
[01:26:00]  Not very good?  No.  It has no form whatsoever in his shot.  Bad 50s layups, or was he –  But he brags about how he goes back to Chicago and plays basketball all the time with his pals.  It's like, he didn't learn anything playing so much basketball.  Barack Obama, Brickhouse, shoots 22 baskets.  And misses every single one of them.  Look.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Whoops.  If you claim to be a basketball player, you're going to make one of these.  No problem.  He does stink, but –  How embarrassing is the – 
[01:26:30]  It keeps going.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  The embarrassing is that Bush could probably give him a run for his money one-on-one.  Yeah.  That's a sin.  That's not good.  I mean senior.  And he's got all these little kids.  He moves in.  Oh, he's terrible.  He moves in even closer.  Rick House.  I thought that went in.  22 in a row he misses in front of kids.  Imagine that.  You're the president and everyone's watching every shot you make. 
[01:27:00]  It's being filmed.  Right.  And then he moves way in.  Move in a little closer.  Oh, he sucks.  Oh, no.  He can't even lay up.  Oh, my God.  He's missing everything.  He's on one of those loops.  He's now just a couple feet from the basket and still missing everything.  And a little kid just takes a shot and makes it.  And then he finally –  There it is.  He finally made it.  All right.  Yay.  The king has made the shot.  He stinks.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, that was funny.  He's horrible.  Go back to what Magic Johnson had to say. 
[01:27:30]  Because your name was the name mentioned in the recordings of racist remarks believed to be made by Clippers owner Donald Sterling.  Plain and simple.  When you heard –  Another broadcaster with a lisp.  What was your reaction?  Let's say that I was really upset.  You know, you can't understand how hurt I was.  I need this like I need AIDS.  I was hurt for all African Americans and all my –  Minorities because when a man who owns a team in the NBA and Donald Sterling has had issues in the past, so this is not the first time. 
[01:28:00]  And I've known Donald.  One of the first men I met when I came to L.A.  Dr. Buss took me to his annual Malibu beach party.  Actually, my first week in L.A.  He dressed me as a waiter.  And then I met with Donald two or three times.  He wanted to discuss the issues with his Clipper team.  So I had a friendship with him. 
[01:28:30]  So for him to then make these comments or alleged comments about myself as well as other African Americans and minorities, there's no place in our society for it.  There's no place in our league because we all get along.  We all play with different races of people when you're in sports.  That's what makes sports so beautiful.  Really?  And then he's put his own team in a tough situation. 
[01:29:00]  So I believe that once Commissioner Silver – I was going to say Stern – Silver, you know, does all his due diligence, get all the information, gather the information, we got to – he's got to come down hard.  He shouldn't own a team anymore, and he should stand up and say, I don't want to own a team anymore, especially when you have African Americans renting his apartments, coming to the games, and playing for him and coaching for him. 
[01:29:30]  This is bad for everybody.  Do you know, by the way, Magic Johnson, who is one of the nicest athletes in history, when he comes out and says something like, you are fucking cooked.  That's so bad for this guy.  We'll see how this plays out in the next day or two.  He's what they call a national treasure, right?  Magic is really a loved guy, yeah.  Certainly, certainly.  Michael Jordan said there's no room in the NBA for an owner with such racist beliefs. 
[01:30:00]  There's never room.  And as an owner, I'm obviously disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views.  My goodness.  LeBron James said there's no room for Donald Sterling in our league.  Well, way to go, LeBron.  Oh, boy.  You might want to pump up your statement a little bit.  Yeah, right?  Snoop Dogg called Sterling.  Like, pump it up like Snoop Dogg did.  What's Snoop saying?  LeBron just says there's no room for Donald Sterling in our league.  That's like the safest thing you could possibly say.  Then you got Snoop Dogg that says Sterling. 
[01:30:30]  Did you call him a racist?  Oh, wait for you.  This is the best one.  He's a racist.  We have a video of it.  Oh, you got it?  Oh, yeah.  This is even better to hear.  Oh, we went to the YouTube.  A message to the motherfucker that owned the Clippers.  You bitch-ass, redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker.  Fuck you.  Your mama and everything connected to you, you racist piece of shit.  Fuck you.  Damn, Snoop.  Snoop has since apologized.  Snoop Doggy Dogg.  What happened? 
[01:31:00]  Snoop Doggy.  Hey, LeBron, that's how you do it.  Yeah, you got to love that.  That's pretty to the point.  But LeBron goes, my motherfucker, white bread.  But LeBron says, there's no room for Donald Sterling in our league.  Yeah.  But you know, behind the scenes, he probably is saying something very close to what Snoop  just did.  Yeah.  And then, breaking overnight, Victor Willis.  Does anyone know who Victor Willis is?  The lead singer of the Village People.  Of course I do.  You think I don't know the man that's saying YMCA and in the Navy and I am what I am.  Which one was he?  He was the lead singer of the cop. 
[01:31:30]  The cop?  Yes, he was replaced eventually.  I had heard, I mean, I'm just going off memory, that he was not a homosexual.  Oh.  I had heard he was not gay.  And then he left the band.  He might not be in the band anymore.  I think he's not there anymore.  But he owns the songs.  Does he really?  Wow.  Well, he's a fucking bastard.  Victor Willis of the Village People says he will ban the use of YMCA during Clippers  games.  Wow.  So he's making his stand.  Okay.  Damn.  Victor Willis.  Not allowing him to do the YMCA. 
[01:32:00]  Now you're just taking the fun away from the fans.  That's right.  If you ask me.  They have to start singing YMCA.  Not a song or a joke.  Boo.  Because that Gary Glitter song was fun for everyone.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  That's because he might have had a few pictures on his hard drive.  We can't enjoy that song anymore at sporting events.  Right?  that's uh that's how we know it for today damn i'm sure more will come out i i wouldn't be  surprised if she probably has the doozy still to release you know what you might be right the doozy 
[01:32:30]  you might be right dropping the old uh n bombs the doozy where that would be a biggie where they want  you know donald sterling's people to tap out yeah but they're calling her going all right what else  you got and she goes i got the doozy and then they go okay all right all right all right this  is what we're gonna do for you someone tapes me playing call of duty i'm sunk yeah yeah i yell a  lot of things out terrible awful things why do you do that anthony well do you know what they do in 
[01:33:00]  israel wow why do you have to be so hurtful toward those people yeah wow all right we should take a  break because uh i think she has more you think yeah you think she has a you know we have the  atomic bombs yeah somewhere but lulu yeah i think so yeah yeah i think she's got a few oh yeah because  she's trying to get out of a lawsuit obviously she doesn't have that type of money she has that type 
[01:33:30]  of money when she's with him but i don't think she has that type of money on her own and so now she's  trying to get herself out of a sticky situation oh boy yeah i believe there's just a little more  or or this i wonder if she went with and said look and they said we don't care he oh maybe he was  arrogant about this one and now this is going to cost him his team right yeah he's done oh yeah  he's done what can the nba do though like what what can what's whatever his name is silver do  well i think eventually uh maybe the players really do completely get involved and either like 
[01:34:00]  say fuck it and not play anymore this season or like you said you know ask out of their contracts  certainly you're not going to get you're not going to get quality players to come to that team  i'm sure there's one of those clauses in there and that their private little charter that says you  know embarrassing the team or the nba i've heard no language really yes i've heard that again it's a  it's a financial thing they can sell the team out from under you if you're not paying your bills  but what and they said also like they give some kind of a vote but the play the the owners would be 
[01:34:30]  hesitant to do that to throw this guy out because then they're all vulnerable to something else  but i'm sure that not even an nba charter can override civil rights so if it's shown that he  didn't hire somebody maybe or didn't pay someone what they were supposed to be paid based on race  alone then he's fucked on you know a whole nother level he lost that i know didn't he win that loss  because he was sued by uh elgin baylor right and uh who claimed discrimination i don't know if it 
[01:35:00]  was legit or not and he's 81 you know maybe he says fuck it i'm not i'm just gonna hang tight and  then the clippers turn into the washington generals just the laughing stock of the league  uh what would get i don't know and you got to think there's other oh yeah if you i mean there's  got to be other owners i think exactly like this oh they're shitting right now huh oh fuck oh no  you fucking idiot how do you think you're gonna ruin it you're gonna ruin it sit there with your  young chippy fucking girlfriend and just uh and just you know look at her phone but there really is 
[01:35:30]  no room for racist talk in professional sports either oh no especially if you go to washington  to play football oh that's right oh right right the reds double standard the double standards here  abound uh on every level owners the players the fans um the outrage the sense of outrage that people  have for this should be given toward other things also that are a lot more important i think to the  black community than uh just some old racist guy right you know i'll tell you what would get 
[01:36:00]  something moving they'll finish out the year and i think they should finish out the year just because  the fans have been with these guys for years and it looks like they probably will but i mean that's  the statement though holy fuck all of a sudden the guys go they they walk out on the court to start  the game and just go nah and walk off oh my god you want to talk about a story that people will be  talking about starting next year in the beginning of the season if they're still there nothing's been  done well you got you got i'm sorry jimmy yeah no it's your point i'm sorry none of the players 
[01:36:30]  if none of the players showed up to spring training well if if every black player said  we are not playing while the other owners allow a guy like this to survive in our culture and our  nba culture we will not show up while he's still there by then though in this country people will  be like why what happened yeah i'm saying like that would be yeah a tremendous that would be the move  or do it now which isn't going to happen most likely uh i think how this plays out if he stays in  place you're just not going to get talent coming to the clippers and that's where it hurts everybody 
[01:37:00]  and then the numbers are going to drop drastically because you got a shitty team no that hurts too  all these cultural references like the ymca not being played and all these other little things  that will add up and he's fun his whole life revolves around probably being the owner of the  clipper so i i don't i don't see him stepping down unless in some weird way he's forced in a  ridiculous way to step down he's not i don't know does he make a statement like he's a tear-filled 
[01:37:30]  oh there's no way are we gonna say my culpa for this guy are we gonna see an old man crying in  the near future god yeah oh boy can you imagine if he gave a press conference i mean the silence  waiting for him to talk and then all he did was complain about the way they played last game and  didn't mention this at all yeah and fired doc rivers right coach yeah the coach had something  to say too huh yeah when your own players are fucking not standing and not only are they not  standing by him they are like that uniform thing was his whole team saying fuck our owner yeah that's 
[01:38:00]  a big thing man yeah it really is we'll see what happens i think he comes into the locker room  hey boys how you doing let's play a good game out there no but he'll he'll probably start calling  them individually yeah uh yeah or team meeting for anybody that wants to attend it and you know  holy vey look guys well listen why don't we take a break we got a very busy show today we got humble  and fred calling oh well what happened that's huge is it really right well i mean you know you know 
[01:38:30]  maybe i was we kind of like attack them pumping it up kind of and then they were ridiculously cool  about it so now you know we do what we usually do make friends fold up like a cheap uh what folds  cheaply um sheets uh as bob grant would say uh folding a three dollar camera or a cheap camera  fold like a cheap camera like a cheap camera so we got that we got a big uh humble and fred

[01:50:30]  gonna get a humbling fred on the on the phone  oh yeah  some radio show out of canada  i i i just didn't know of them  at all never heard the name or anything  i guess they've been around a while  and they took some weird shot at us 
[01:51:00]  which they since have explained  yes quite eloquently  and uh our fans um  just beat the shit out of them on their facebook page  they will do that  and then uh humbling fred basically thought it was hilarious  as they're reading some of the facebook uh posts  and uh  it was hilarious  that kind of endeared us to them  and yeah  yeah  and we said ah what the hell  let's talk to them  so we're gonna talk to them in a few minutes  i guess  yeah 
[01:51:30]  we were supposed to talk to them at 7 30  so what are they on sirius  but they're also on regular radio  i don't even know what the  humbling fred in the morning  here we go  toronto  thanks very much for having us on your show  toronto  no problem  i gotta turn up the volume here a little bit  thank you  um  but  where do you guys broadcast from  we're just uh west of toronto  it's part of toronto called etobicoke  we're uh on a street  it's called 30th street 
[01:52:00]  there's  it's a residential area  with some industrial plazas  and we're on the second floor  of this sort of shabby industrial plaza  in a suburb of toronto  wow  take some perspective guys  we're about  two or three blocks  from where our mayor did crack  oh  nice  okay  all right  a historic site  this is his jurisdiction  in fact he was found  uh there's a  uh little gas station here  with uh one of those quick stop things  having a leak  behind this gas station 
[01:52:30]  against the tree  what a guy  i can almost see that place from here  wait when you come here  we'll take you for a mayor mccrack tour  of our neighborhood  nice  do you guys have  in your industrial park area  is there like any like bustle  of people walking by  or is it just basically  the upstairs of a crappy little building  yeah  the upstairs of a crappy little building  we sent you some pictures  to give you some perspective  we actually built a studio ourselves  but why would you pick there  you couldn't pick some  i don't know  cool area or  somewhere with a vibe 
[01:53:00]  we've been asked by  siriusxm in canada  to come to their studios  downtown  but we wanted to stay away  from them  yeah  oh  on our own  wow we're on the same page  there sirs  good choice  we hate being in this facility  we used to have our own  little space  ourselves  that they took away from us  we're sitting at  the table we sit at  i bought in 1984  it was the first dining room table  my wife and i bought  after we were married  i'm telling you  that's the table  we're sitting at right now  we invested about 
[01:53:30]  thirty five hundred bucks  maybe in equipment  and then started  this little business  this could be the first time  in our careers  but i think we owe you  an apology  i want to  apologize  the attention we've gotten  from you and your fans  is worth all the courage  in the world  now here's the funny thing  is we've been fired  by radio stations  we were together  as a morning show  for a long time  right  back in  actually a couple years  before you guys started  in buffalo  and we did pretty well  but then all of a sudden  we started getting 
[01:54:00]  a couple of  you know  different consultants  and sort of  screwing around with us  we got fired  and we found ourselves  without a job  and without a place  to broadcast  so we started  a podcast  the only difference  from a lot of podcasts  is we tried to make it  broadcast quality  and lo and behold  radio stations  started to listen to us  do the kind of show  we always wanted to do  but we're told to play  seven or eight  stupid songs an hour  right  so fast forward  to radio stations  approached us  Sirius came to us  and said  we'll take your product  and we said 
[01:54:30]  well we don't want to  we don't want to go work  in a building anymore  right  we just want to stay  in this shithole  in Etobicoke  you know  and it's like  yeah  20 minutes from each one  of our houses  and we don't have  to go through  the hustle  and the bustle  of the city  so it works  from that  nice arrangement  so what year  did you guys  start together  this will be  our 25th year  1980  me and Ann  me and Ann  started 20 years ago  I was in Buffalo  by myself  back in  I don't know  late 80s I guess  well do you remember  CFNY  out of Toronto  sure  that's where we were  that's where we were 
[01:55:00]  I just don't  I don't remember  the name  Humlin Fred  when I was up there  well that's alright  we're doing our show  in Fred's Dining Room  did you know  did you know  Iron Mike Benson  yeah  yeah he was a good  friend of mine  I mean we lost touch  over the years  but he was a solid dude  unfortunately  he passed this past year  nice  bring it up  wow  no everyone knows  Iron Mike Benson  in that area though  oh yeah  you know  and that  the station  after he passed away  they did some great 
[01:55:30]  memorial stuff for him too  it was excellent  you know  he wasn't one of these  radio guys  that was quickly forgotten  no yeah  they didn't just say  alright  we gotta move on  so  as far as apologizing  all we can say  and we gave you guys  we actually talked about it  on our show  and we didn't really understand  this whole jocktobering thing  but I think I have a question  for you too  and I think I'd ask this  of your audience  what is the normal routine  of guys that get targeted  because I know you guys don't  you actually didn't tell  your audience to do this  they just 
[01:56:00]  it's part of the bit  but what do most guys do  when they get this onslaught  they pretty much  they shut down  their Facebook page  yeah they do that  and then they  they do a lot of crying  I believe  I mean you guys  you guys took it great  yeah it was funny  you guys talked about it  like most of them  don't talk about it  and just make a joke about it  and you read some  of the funnier ones  and you read some  of the obnoxious ones  and it was very funny  to listen to  and most people don't do that  the genuine feeling  that what was posted 
[01:56:30]  was so vile  and horrid  that was cracking me up  an AIDS fire  when you read  that someone  could die in an AIDS fire  it was just funny  to hear you read that  what is that  my favorite thing  I was telling Fred  on the weekend  is hashtag AIDS fires  trending on Twitter  it did pretty well  that's what I said  to Howard this morning too  and there was that  photoshopped picture  of him taking me  from the rear  I kept looking at it  and I'm thinking  you know I should hate  this more than I do  what's the matter  it's that 
[01:57:00]  the really unbelievably  racist stuff  the little progeria  kids  it's just  a smorgasbord  of filth  yeah  October started  as kind of a  throwaway bit  but now it's  god we've done it  I don't know  at least eight years  in a row now  somewhere around there  and then when we heard  we were fun  but not funny  we knew we had  to do something  but I was confused  by the whole thing  so you guys had a PD  that flew you down  to New York  just to listen  to New York radio 
[01:57:30]  back in the day  here's the thing  it's one of those  stories that  we would love  to tell you  over a bunch  of beers  one day in New York  because we were  doing pretty well  in this city  we were number one  18 to 34  we had a good thing  going and then  Stern came to town  and it hurt us  absolutely  because we were  that morning show  if you wanted  some irreverence  and then he was  the you know  Stern  you've never seen  anything like it  so we started  getting consulted  to death  and this one guy  was like  you guys  we've got to  take you down  to New York  and as we told  the story  you heard it  the other day  he was a  he's a fucking dick 
[01:58:00]  we were hung over  you know  there's part of the story  of the night  before I got so drunk  Fred put me in a cab  and I was throwing up  out of the cab  as it went around a corner  and so there we are  8 o'clock in the morning  listening to you guys  and this PD  slash consultant  was saying  listen here  listen to these guys  this is the show  right  I'm confused  we were never on  in mornings though  back then  we were doing  afternoon drive  no it was afternoon  it was afternoon  yeah okay  we actually started  listening on the way  in on the cab 
[01:58:30]  from the airport  that's right  you guys were on  in the afternoon  yeah  so you've got to  understand  this was 13 years ago  and the frame of mind  we were in  while we were listening  yeah  so when we made  the reference  we just didn't  find it funny  please appreciate  the frame of mind  we were in  yeah  yeah no  we understand that  but not everything  is funny  but then you guys  were referring to  a bit we were doing  where girls were  pretty much finger  banging each other  something like  have the internet 
[01:59:00]  so  that type of thing  absolutely worked  on the radio  for a while  it was great  by the way  let's be serious  we have a  we're introduced  to some of the people  that we work with  one of them is  Phil  a chubby Asian boy  that produces  our program  blabo  we'll have him  finger himself  during this segment  and then of course  there's Eileen  who your audience  was  I believe 
[01:59:30]  one of your audiences  wanted her to  give birth to the fetus  and then kill it  with a knitting needle  a knitting needle  despicable people  how to fuck  a bucket of AIDS  oh they're just  the worst fans ever  this was the frame  of mind  we were in  and you know what  to be fair to you guys  it was  the guy that took us  there  we're looking at him  going okay  if you would let us 
[02:00:00]  have somebody do this  during our show  we would  we'd let him  but we're playing  seven songs an hour  you know one of the things  I know you guys  can relate to this  you know every instinct  a program director  or consultant  has given us  has been wrong  it's almost like  a Heinfeld episode  if we just did the opposite  we'd be fine  exactly  we were jealous  of your ability  to not have to play  a bunch of music  to be able to do  what you guys do  and now that we're  getting to do it  we're having the most  success we've ever had  because we're doing 
[02:00:30]  what we always thought  we should have  right  and we just  we decided to put it  all on the line  because you know  we were playing music  when we first came  to New York  and we'd start dropping  all the records  like these records  because we knew  they were going to  throw us out  within six months  if we didn't start  showing some numbers  so we just said  you know screw this  let's stop playing music  let's just do  everything we want to do  we'll do the outrageous  stuff that will get  people on board  and then hopefully  do an entertaining show  in between those things  to keep them listening  and it seemed to work 
[02:01:00]  and we figured out  the consultant thing  a long time ago  they don't have jobs  if you're a successful show  so they've got to  keep coming in  and telling you  something that is wrong  even if they don't  even believe that  in their heart  yeah  well that's the  aggravating thing  I mean you can see  through that so easily  but hey they're thriving  this guy that we're  talking about  that took us to New York  we just found out  that he just latched  onto a couple more stations  as a consultant  wow I'm amazed  they still got jobs  as consultants 
[02:01:30]  so why wouldn't they  just send you cassettes  of all these radio shows  you know what I think  or CDs  I mean CDs  were even happening  at that point  you know I heard you guys  ask that question  I think I remember  they were trying  he was trying to  kind of get in  with Humble and Fred  and he wanted to be our bud  and he took the PD  and it was going to be  like this thing  and we'd go listen  to some radio  it was supposed to be  a fun trip  right  and we got to see  the Leafs and Devils  which was pretty cool  yeah  so basically you had  a Dave Dickless  we had a guy  that we named 
[02:02:00]  Dave Dickless  and he wanted to be  our pal  and he wanted to be  the third member  of the show  yeah  and his ideas  were horrendous  and we knew  if we just did  the complete opposite  we would be fine  that's so funny  because this guy  do you remember  one of his ideas  he was like  he wanted to bring  the staff together  and you'll love this  his idea was to have  a scavenger hunt  at the radio station  when he told Fred  I said hey  are you guys  going to come back  for the scavenger hunt  we're like  you've got to be  fucking kids  yeah we live  on the outside  of the city 
[02:02:30]  you know  35 minutes away  so we had to go  do the morning show  go home  and then come back  to the station  that night  for a scavenger hunt  what kind of scavenger hunt  what did he hide  I think we were trying  to find our dignity  you know the whole thing  now this team building  well he was ahead  of his time  oh yeah  team building  that's good  and listen  the guys that we  work with now  at SiriusXM  are great guys  and they couldn't  have been nicer to us  but I'll tell you  up until including  four or five days ago  when this all happened 
[02:03:00]  on our Facebook page  we get this panicked email  and I'll just tell you  the truth  the email is  guys don't talk  about this  and we're like  well that would be dumb  and I said to Fred  I said what am I  going to tell this guy  he doesn't want us  to mention  opium  on our show  and we're like  no we got to  this is the only thing  we can do  exactly  things up  a memory  we were at AF  in Boston  we were 
[02:03:30]  I mean we were  ripping them off  and all this crap  and me and Ant  were completely excited  that Howard was talking  to us  because he was  the much bigger show  in Boston  and I'm like  it could only help us  that he's talking about us  because we can handle  ourselves  and Dave Dickless  actually pulled me aside  and said  Howard was talking  about you this morning  and I go  yeah isn't that great  we got it  when a bigger show  talks about you  that's really good  unless you're  a horrible radio show  and you don't have 
[02:04:00]  any skills  and I go  isn't that great  he goes  no that's not good  at all  we don't want him  talking about  you guys  or the radio station  and I remember  looking at him  like you just  don't get it  he didn't want us  to mention it  he's mentioning  our names  to a much bigger  you know  pool of potential listeners  they know nothing  because of this  this whole thing  went down  I guarantee  there's going to be  a bunch of our listeners  that are now going to  you know  check you guys out  from time to time  well how about this story  and it's the same guy  that took us to New York  back and I guess 
[02:04:30]  it was 2001-2002  the midday girl  at Q107  the rock station  in Toronto  right  she applied to be  a playboy  a Victorian  a pictorial  girls in radio  right  lo and behold  they pick her  they come and do  this whole pictorial  the issue comes out  and you know  what we were told  don't talk about it  wow  why  because it was  objectifying women  or whatever  this was a rock  radio station  in Toronto  the midday check 
[02:05:00]  looked great  in playboy  don't talk about it  now to give you  some more perspective  the guy that was  his boss  is the guy  that fired Stern  what's his name  John Hayes  John Hayes  we're in this building  where John Hayes  is the uber boss  and everyone's  freaking out  Fred and I  were working  at a guy's  talk station  and we had a calendar  where we were  it was just  nothing  it was called  the mojo girls  calendar  and all it is  is beautiful women  and then me  fully clothed  me and Fred  yeah  and we couldn't  put this  fucking calendar  up in our office  oh god 
[02:05:30]  it's radio  I know  yeah  so when we heard  you guys  talking about us  and we saw  the email  from our guys  and we were like  you know what  we're just going to  do what we think  is the right thing  which is  address it  and I think  your fans got  the message  right away  that we thought  that stuff  was funny  the only stuff  we took down  is the stuff  we were worried  that would  close our Facebook  yeah but what  did this guy  think was going  to happen  we have no idea 
[02:06:00]  yeah  even if it was  ugly  I mean I would  still bring attention  to your show  you made a great  point about  the bigger show  Stern  like honestly  has there ever  been a PD  that any of us  have worked for  and this is Fred  for my theory  before that  was actually  great on the air  this is the only  business where  if you're really  shitty at what  you do  you get to be  in charge of  all the people  that are good  at it  yeah we were  100% in the past  it's absolutely  true  we pretty much  have hated  every single PD  that we've worked  for pretty much  couple exceptions 
[02:06:30]  that I don't even  feel like naming  and they all  but they've all  have been just  horrible  horrible  and they try  to be on the air  they've tried  like early  in their career  they were always  on air guys  they sucked  they couldn't  cut it  so yeah  they become  the people  that are in  charge of  the people  on the air  it makes  no sense  right  and a lot  of them  manage by  fear too  yeah  they just want  to take the  safe route  they don't want  to drop  right  back to what  you're saying  there on my  point is  when you know  what resonates 
[02:07:00]  with people  and you guys  do  you've been doing  it your career  we think we do  you know  we say things  that people  catch on to  when you're  being instructed  by coaches  and managers  that aren't  really a hundred  percent sure  what other  human beings  connect with  how they tell  you to do  anything  is absurd  it really is  the only business  where that happens  yeah  it's our jobs  to just figure  a way around that  if you're the  shittiest car salesman  you don't get  to pay in charge  of the guys  and sell  the other cars  you know  the problem  now and it's  happening in  Canada 
[02:07:30]  which happened  in the states  prior  is that  they're taking  one PD now  and making him  PD of four  and five stations  and the problem  is they don't  have time  for anything  and what's  happening  is they're  losing touch  with what's  going on  out there  so then  they're turning  around  and instructing  their announcers  to do things  when they  themselves  are out of  touch  because they're  spread so thin  they completely  ruined radio  regular radio  so  satellite's still  doing okay  oh by the way  are we being  funny enough 
[02:08:00]  for you  it doesn't  have to be  funny  it could just  be fun  it doesn't  have to be  funny  it could just  be fun  and luckily  our show  is neither  wow man  you guys are  on the same  page as us  that's for sure  you've been  through the same  shit  we can whine  about radio  for days  and often  too  we're pretty  much only a few  months away  from broadcasting  from a strip  mall ourselves  so  you have a home  here  did you guys  look at the  pictures  where are we 
[02:08:30]  broadcast  we actually  built this  studio  Freddie and I  and some of  the interns  we had another  office  and we moved  here about  four months  ago in this  building  and actually  you know what  it's not a bad  space  you'd be surprised  and the quality  of broadcast  whatever that  comes out of  here  isn't too bad  so what  you're on  XM Canada  are you on  any regular  stations  or  well we're  on Canada  Laughed  which is  168 on  Sirius XM  kind of like  Ron and Fez  are on Raw Dog  so we do a show  in the morning  7 to 9 live  Eastern  then they  repeat it  we're also 
[02:09:00]  on some  terrestrial stations  as well  yeah we got a  couple of  terrestrial stations  to take the  show and  yeah and  rerun it  good for you  yeah  alright  cool  alright  hey guys  you know  great talking  to you  actually  I have no  issues with you  we were  it was just  an excuse  to kill  an hour  and I felt  bad about that  because I was  the guy  these guys  are that hard  up for content  I should have  never  yeah  take that  with you  you were  just an hour  you were 
[02:09:30]  just an hour  no because  Howard and I  often talk  about that  we've always  wanted to  do a show  where we  could take  anything  and talk  about it  for as long  as we want  I was just  hoping we were  going to listen  to one of our  shows where we  talk about  Costco for  45  I just want  to say  Eileen  do you want  to say  anything  to me  and Anthony  oh  Eileen  suck it  oh gosh  now  Eileen  good gosh  don't say  that  Eileen  were you okay 
[02:10:00]  with everything  that happened  on Facebook  oh yeah  you know what  I mean  it's part of  radio  it's part of  the talk  and everything  it doesn't  bother me  and I  normally I  talk more  about fucking  a ham  than baby  clothes  just don't  hold the  guys back  don't put  up those  yield signs  look out  don't say  stuff like  okay  now guys  also to be  fair  Phil  a lot of  guys on  Twitter  are calling  you  P-rock  now  I don't  usually  sound  Asian  but  thank you 
[02:10:30]  keep that  dignity  up  you guys  we could  do 45  on this  I'm trying  to find  what are you  looking for  where's  E-rock  all the  things  Eileen  shouldn't  be doing  oh you  got the  whole  template  do you  have another  minute  or you  guys  gotta go  where's  E-rock  where is  he  oh  E-rock  he's lumbering  somewhere  yeah  trudging  heavily 
[02:11:00]  down the  hallway  he's got  a free  hand  get him  to do  his job  yeah  yeah  we can  never  oh look  he's lumbering  up the  hallway  god  he's so  slow  he swings  his big  arm  to give  the illusion  of speed  and  firmer  there's  nothing  going on  where are the  whole clips  come on  E-rock  I want to show  Eileen  what she  shouldn't be  doing  on a daily  basis  you got it  hold  okay  sorry about that 
[02:11:30]  Eileen you listening  yeah I sure am  okay here  they are  oh wait  wait wait  no come on  no no  it's not  funny  these are the  things you  shouldn't be  saying  stop it  oh come on  holding the  guys back  I don't get  it  I don't get  it  I just wanted  to be part  of the group  anything like 
[02:12:00]  that is there  any  do you feel  she jumps in  and holds you  guys back  keeps you in  check  yeah you  don't  no  I'm trying to  find the  Eileen  soundboard  you should  hear  oh please  please do  I would if  we had  I can't  find  no  my personal  favorite is  you guys  guys  now  oh stop it  now  guys  I'm generally  the one that  takes you to  the place  that is a  little bit 
[02:12:30]  grosser than  where we'd  already been  that's good  so you don't  do  a couple of  women over  the years  that have  worked with  us  yeah  and of  the many  that have  done what  you just  played  Eileen and  another woman  named Sandra  are by far  the best  and on an  average day  the line of  the day  goes to her  again I  should have  prepared some  here because  that would  have been  the thing  to do  you know  what we'll  find it  and they  can play  it every  hour  tomorrow  I will tell  you this  you talk  about bringing  attention to  the story  about Stern 
[02:13:00]  mentioning you  our two  most downloaded  shows of  2014 were  the two  days you guys  talked about  it so thank  you very  oh there  you go  and I  guarantee  it'll lead  to some  some listeners  helping out  now guys  let's not  make fun  of people  words hurt  I had to  save the bed  I know it  wasn't doing  as well as  I was hoping  words do hurt  I had to  save it there  it was fun  yeah hey 
[02:13:30]  before we  screw this up  why don't we  yeah all right  nice talking to  you guys  absolutely  a real pleasure  and honestly  next time  we're going  to take  you guys  for a beer  slow down  that ain't  happening  let's go  let's go  into a hotel  room and  listen to  some New  York radio  by the way  I know you  guys have  your own  channel  which is  super  impressive  if there's  some reason  for some  point  you need  some  Canadian  con  I knew it 
[02:14:00]  would probably  end that way  but I didn't  know when  or where  that was the  perfect place  for the hang  up  that's the  trying to pitch  for the channel  that's the ultimate  test right now  if they are  laughing their  asses off  they're all  writing my book  that was  hilarious  very cool guys  that's you know  what  they've been  going through  the same  bullshit  over the same 
[02:14:30]  probably pretty  much the same  amount of years  so  tell them to  send a couple  humble and  Fred bits  and we'll  throw it on  there you go  on the weekend  as friends of the  show or something  doesn't even have  to be funny  just fun  yeah  some fun clips  right  but it's amazing  that someone  says even  recently  told these  guys don't  talk about  like what  are these  cowards  who are  pds and  running radio  shows  they're just  cowards  they're petrified  of doing  anything  and it's  tough  because you  gotta just  be able to  say fuck  you  yep  you know  there were  times  like Snoop Dogg  to say fuck 
[02:15:00]  you  there were  times in our  careers that  the whole  the old  fuck you  could have  really been  not good  true true  but that's  that's your  job as a  broadcaster  to try to  figure out a  way around  all that  shit  because it's  all bullshit  in the end  it's all  bullshit  really is  god they had  a guy that  wanted to be  like their  friend and  kind of part  of the show  same thing  oh did we  go through  that  that's a  there are a  couple of  go-getters  though it  seems you  know  they got out  of terrestrial  radio and  decided 
[02:15:30]  they're just  gonna build  their own  dopey studio  and rebuild  some radio  pretty good  started from  the bottom  now we're  here  oh damn  started from  the bottom  now we're  is that how  he says  here  no  no it's  not  started from  the bottom  now  no  what does he  say  no  what does he  say  started from  the bottom  now  like that  no  how does he  say it  he kind of  says it  without even  the r  here  oh yeah  here  started from 
[02:16:00]  the bottom  now  like that  no  no  just say  here  just say  here  started from  the bottom  now  oh there  it is  er  no  it's not  the er  I just  said it's  like without  started from  the bottom  now  er  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  but still  it's  is it true  that um  Pharrell um  followed up his  really nice  sweet  happy song  with uh  with a uh  like a drug  song or  something  uh  I'm not  sure  someone was 
[02:16:30]  telling me that  the other day  what's his  next  his next  uh  single  cause uh  happy  oh my god  no way  Ian Barrett  what  remember Ian Barrett  he was the  the producer  of Real Rock TV  uh  Eric in Seattle  go ahead  hey guys  you guys were  talking about  the end of the  show on Friday  about  Scorch's uh  TV show  from about  two or three  years ago  what you didn't  mention at the  time is that  Ian Barrett 
[02:17:00]  your buddy  from Real Rock  TV days  he was one of  the main guys  behind that  version of  Scorch's show  Scorch actually  had a professional  career with him  and Ian was  kind of a  director and  producer of  that show  of PFG uh  TV  it was the one  that we called  Scorch TV  Scorch TV  Scorch TV  I was wondering  what happened  Ian Barrett  incarnation  that's a great  he got a little  weird uh  with us after we  blew up our  spot and moved  to New York  uh I got  I saw a lot  of tweets over  the weekend  of people that  couldn't get 
[02:17:30]  weird news  yeah yeah  they're just  going around  their house  going weird  news  uh Scorchy  what's the next  Pharrell song  I heard it's  like completely  different than  happy  well there's one  article about a  song he did with  the national  and what's the  what's the song  it's called I've  been happier  no that's not  either  uh  is that like  twist again  twist in on the  beach or twist  under the boardwalk  or something  let's say hi to  Steve 
[02:18:00]  yes  Steve  hey good morning  guys  hello  how you doing  what up Steve  hi Steve  uh yeah  Anthony I hope  you learned  something from  the Scotty  uh Sterling  uh tobacco  Donald Sterling  brother  Donald  well  well  Donald  I'm sorry  yeah how ridiculous  uh and  asinine and backwards  uh you sound  sometimes when you  espouse the same  view  oh yeah  yeah particularly  in light of the 
[02:18:30]  universal condemnation  of his remarks  you know  they were  obviously uh  universally rejected  and  do I  do I  hopefully you take  hopefully you take  something away  from that  uh huh  okay because  quite frankly  uh  he sounds  like you  in the future  you know  oh  have I ever  have I ever  said anything  racist  I don't think  I've even  said anything  racist like that 
[02:19:00]  you know  I've quoted  statistics  and uh  pointed out  genuine  problems in the  black community  and not just  these you know  oh that guy's a  racist and it's  all over the  news  everyone's talking  about it's  the biggest  issue ever  yet in the  past two  weekends  over 100  people in  Chicago  and and  I would say  99.9% of  them black  young black  men have  been shot  uh  20 killed  um  in in  Chicago  in one city  alone 
[02:19:30]  isn't that a  little more  um  important to be  putting as  much energy  as is going  into uh  the Sterling  situation  to put that  Rahm Emanuel  should be looking  into that  maybe if the  uh  Chicago Bulls  want to um  get involved in  something that  means a lot  to to uh  black the black  community and  black youth  uh that this is  something that  should be looked  at  so you're good  at conflating  issues  uh is that  what it is  you are you  really don't have  to do that  because one has 
[02:20:00]  nothing to do  with no it  does though  it's it's it's  the use of  resources  it's the use of  resources  and energies  that are put in  the wrong  places  for various  political and  racial reasons  racial and  political reasons  you have a guy  who obviously  because you  can't you can't  look at the  situation in  Chicago with  the the shooting  deaths of young  black men and  say that that  shouldn't get as  much energy at  least as much  energy and 
[02:20:30]  notoriety in  mainstream media  as this situation  is getting because  it's a hell of a  lot more detrimental  to young black men  than uh than  this clown saying  spouting off to  his girlfriend  yeah but we can  agree on that but  they're separate  issues dude  they're separate  issues  I'm saying  that I am  saying  no I'm saying  why aren't the  people that are so  outraged about  this outraged  and using that  energy and their  power of celebrity  to really put a 
[02:21:00]  uh a face on  the issue of  violence in  the inner cities  amongst black  youth  well but  quite frankly  there's some  in the community  who do just  that  some in the  community  where  where  where is  uh  where  there are so  many non-violent  uh movements  again though not  addressing the  issues  there you know  well again we  can't speak for  what the media  should do  and not  what they want 
[02:21:30]  to do  just don't  break the  issues  that's all  I'm not  have I  have I  have I  have I  have I  have I  have I defended  this guy's  statements at all  have I even done  that on twitter  have I defended  this guy's  statements  I think I  think the tone  of your remarks  certainly suggests  my tone was  anybody's private  conversation put in  public would  condemn them to  a life of  fucking exile  because everyone  in their private  conversations say  things that other  people would find  hugely offensive 
[02:22:00]  and that's what I'm  saying and that's  the only defense I  have I don't  defend what he's  saying I have  not said worse  things over the  radio I have  not said worse  things over the  radio I speak  the truth  young man I  speak the truth  about racial  issues  that's true  when have I  ever done that  oh you've done  that you I  mean any time  you ring your  stupid bell when  someone makes a  reference to  something yeah  yeah come on  really that's 
[02:22:30]  preposterous sir  I'm trying to get  a red cap to  take my bag  no you're just  being an idiot  oh red cap  you're just  throwing in the  future that's  wrong and you  should really take  note of that  hopefully you  will learn  something  how about you  learn something  how about you  learn a little  something  do it again  listen listen  listen to  listen to  bowling for  behave  just take  something positive  away from it  that's all  how about you 
[02:23:00]  take something  positive  HIV  no they're not  they're so  racist  you know in  recent news you've  seen real racism  in recent news you've  seen real racism  now don't you feel  silly throwing that  word around to  conservatives or  republicans or  people that lean a  little right that's  just speaking their  opinions but you  you call it  racism now you  see real racism 
[02:23:30]  it's like oh  that's racism not  the fact that  somebody disagrees  with obama and  they turn around  and call him a  racist stop  throwing the word  around you're  taking all the  fucking punch out  of it everyone's a  goddamn racist  no I am pointing  the racist  accusation at  you oh yeah  is it reasonable  yes at you  well I mean I  can't hopefully  it's just me  doesn't represent  your real views  because I can't  believe someone in  your position is  that backwards and  that stupid and 
[02:24:00]  that ignorant  well I am  sir  well I can't  address that  of course  are you I got a  question for you  Steve yeah hey  guys hey man are  you Agatha on  Twitter  oh yes I am  that's Agatha  are you really  no no no no I'm  not Agatha  some have said  that Agatha is  actually a guy  no no I don't  think so  I don't think Agatha  is a total troll  I don't believe Agatha 
[02:24:30]  is a woman  not a total troll  but I don't know  I don't think Agatha  is a woman  I don't think it's  what it is  you think it's a  guy  yeah  not necessarily  Steve but I  mean just  yeah cause  she  always has  excuses why  she can't  call the show  to debate  Anthony  she has no  problem  she has no  problem debating  Anthony on  Twitter but  when it comes to  actually calling  the show  there's always  like oh I  was at the  gym I was  here I was  traveling I  was I was  taking my  bubble bath  whatever  yeah  I'm pretty  convinced too 
[02:25:00]  that that's  not a woman  is that you  Steve you're  not Agatha  I would never  hide behind a  suit of him  never  who are you on  Twitter  I'm Steve  on Twitter  you don't have  Steve on  Twitter  you don't have  Steve on  Twitter  I bet you  Steve Jobs  might have  had Steve  on Twitter  but you  Steve don't  have Steve  I have  Steve  yes I do  on Twitter  that's the  incomplete  name  oh you don't  want to give  out your  Twitter  that's fair  yeah I  really don't 
[02:25:30]  want to do  that  but  it's very  funny  you know  yeah  very funny  but again  your views  are sometimes  very very  great  very very  authentic  authentic  real and  accurate  I understand  yes my  views  it probably  reflects  your upbringing  I understand  that way  you know  in terms of  your  parental  upbringing  your social  no it's  it's what  I see  it's what 
[02:26:00]  I see  it's what  I see  and it's  statistics  hold on  hold on  Sal wants  in on this  badly  Sal in D.C.  you're on  with Steve  Steve where  are you calling  from  we don't  want to  give that  either  New York  no I've  debated  with Anthony  no I  know who  you are  I recognize  the voice  hold on  listen to  Sal  he's on  go ahead  Sal  hey Steve  obviously  you're a  casual  fucking  listener  and you  don't  understand  the points  that  Anthony  makes  I'm not  a casual  listener  you're 
[02:26:30]  calling  my  you're  calling  him  a  fucking  racist  you're  accusing  him  of  racism  so  you're  doing  it 
[02:27:00]  the month  shut  the fuck  up  oh  shit  oh  shit  you know  and you  would never  have the  balls  to tell  me  that  to  my  face  you know  most of  you  I  would  believe me  you  wouldn't  listen to  me  listen to  me  I  love this  we are  the world  we are  the children  ebony  and ivory  live together  in perfect  harmony 
[02:27:30]  side by side  on my  piano  keyboard  oh lord  why don't  we  nice  alright guys  we are the  world  I think we got a lot  done there  thank you  yes  thank you so much  thank you  Steve thank you so much  have a good day  thank you sir  are you gonna go to work  today Steve  wow  well that proved  we're just doomed  alright why don't 
[02:28:00]  we uh  we're gonna break  um  we got lots to do  still  you wanna do it now  Jimmy  yeah I might as well  yes very cool  Jimmy's got some  exciting news  Amy kind of mentioned  it uh  a while ago by mistake  but it doesn't matter  it wasn't a giant secret  chlamydia  yes  we don't know who gave it to who  cause we've never slept together  but we do shake hands a lot  that's adorable  uh  I'm doing a show for Vice  uh  dot com  and uh  Vice Media  it's a talk show  it's uh  where I interview people  and uh 
[02:28:30]  sketches and you know  whatever  a regular show  and uh  they're giving me  it's a pilot episode  but I'm getting three episodes  to do as kind of pilots  and we're shooting here in New York  May uh  the 20th  and 21st  we'll be shooting the episodes  and I will give details  on how to get tickets  but I want  O&A fans  to try and get uh  tickets first  I want them to be  sure  these fans  uh  and it's a small studio  it's where Kamau Bell  used to shoot  so we'll probably have  um 
[02:29:00]  you know  115  120 people  which is all I wanted  they actually wanted to do it  in a bigger studio  uptown  but I wanted a smaller  uh  actually I don't want more than  120 people  right  that's awesome  for a talk show  yeah I'm really psyched about it  it's uh  it's what I've wanted to do  for a long long time  no shite  so we start shooting  uh  little things this week  and then the next couple weeks  and uh  I just had to announce it  because Vice is putting out  a press release today  yeah  sweet  yeah  that fucking rocks  yeah  I might tell you  fuck it up  nah  come on  hope I don't mess it up  please don't fuck it up  I think it'll be great 
[02:29:30]  it'll be great  great Jimmy  yeah  nice language freedom  damn  yeah  yeah we've written some uh  some very funny stuff  some saucy stuff  yeah  little saucy  yeah I'm very happy  with it  are you cheeky in it  rather cheeky yeah  could you tell us one  no but I'll tell you  I have to  I would have to find one  that I know we're not shooting  ah  because there are a couple  um  that they were like  I don't know about  oh really  yeah but uh 
[02:30:00]  they're letting me do  pretty much whatever  we want to do  they haven't broken balls  about language  or content or anything  but they're like  well for the first couple  you know you might want to  well it came down  yeah  a little lighter  yeah  there's a couple  you don't want to  they don't want to  come in too hot  because I'm writing it  with a guy named  Kurt Metzger  who writes  he's funny  Kurt's a hilarious  fucking guy  and he's a brilliant writer  so I'm writing with him  and uh  nice  you know he writes  for Amy's show  I've known him for years  he's been writing  for Comedy Central Roasts  and Kurt's a funny fuck 
[02:30:30]  yeah yeah  and uh  it's really weird  to have to look at somebody  and go  alright dude look  that's hilarious  but I don't think  we can quite say it like  I like Kurt  but he writes  like it's fucking  all in the family  in 1976  it's like I can't say that  on fucking  yeah yeah  yeah he's really funny man  so I'm very very happy  so uh  I'll let you guys know  how to get tickets and stuff  yay  and um  I want it to be  ONA fans that are there  because uh  nice  yeah  I'm writing  I honestly  it's being done  for the mentality  of people who listen  to this show  I'm not trying to appeal 
[02:31:00]  I want Vice's audience  to like it  but I'm not going out  and trying to get  hipsters  I'm trying to  otherwise they would have  hired somebody else  to do this  right  I want  this is the fucking people  I want to watch the show  so  cool  anyway  hope you guys like it  we're very happy for you Jimmy  thank you  um  hmm  Mike wants in though  on this  okay  you want to keep  on the racist thing  you sure  uh  Mikey  yeah  I just want to say  uh  one thing  I do not think  Anthony's a racist  oh 
[02:31:30]  but I do disapprove  uh  I'm a black guy  by the way  I do disapprove  of the fact  that he does  promote  that website  uh  in mania  oh yeah  I don't promote it  I talk about it  I mention it  yeah but at the same time  you say  hey  I go from both sides  there's a militant black side  and there's that side  but you never really talk about  which side  from the militant side  oh  oh okay  I'll have to bring up 
[02:32:00]  some of the uh  the militant black sides  you don't really have to  I'm just saying  I know that  you've mentioned that  like numerous times  but  it's funny  that one's more funny  all right  you people  oh  what do you mean  what do you mean  you people  wow  teasing of course  silly goose  I don't know  I love it  I had a black guy  over my house  this weekend  for the love of god

[02:44:30]  oh  whoa  I ate nuts  last night  I had some  almonds  that's why  I corrected  it's an almonds  of course  almonds  almonds  damn  I don't smell it yet  oh it's  it's there  it's a common  it's lingering  a little bit  circling around  god  I love  Alice in Chains  Jesus  is it dated 
[02:45:00]  probably  I guess  I like it  it's so cool  just reminds me  of the 90's  yeah  and you hear  Nirvana  Alice in Chains  all those  going back to  Donald Sterling  ah  this thing always  kind of  strikes me as weird  you got him  saying some racial  shit  you know  and the privacy  of his own home  so that pisses off  a lot of people  yeah  and it should  I guess  right  and then  Snoop Doggy Doggy  calls him  horrendous  horrendously 
[02:45:30]  racist stuff  redneck white  cracker  I know  white bread  yeah  white bread  I mean really  chicken  you're right  I don't  I never understood  that  it's the double  standard that'll  never go away  so because he did  it now it's okay  for other people  to do that to him  right  huh  you know what I'm  trying to say  I know exactly  what you're trying to  say  like I think you  could show your  outrage without  going down the  same road he  did because then  what does that  make you  because you  obviously Snoop  likes to you 
[02:46:00]  know say  some racist  shit obviously  which I'm fine  with I'm totally  fine with it  but I've  noticed in  many of the  videos that  I've seen  where there's  an altercation  between blacks  and whites  right  it's always  the black  person that  first brings  up any type  of race  it's like  yeah  like I'm  not talking  even a fight  like if  there was  a video  that was out  last week  and it was  a reporter  reporting on  squatters  people like 
[02:46:30]  just move  into a fucking  house they  don't own  and they  start squatting  so they were  trying to get  them removed  they finally  did  which is  hard to do  yeah  very hard  to do  so they're  driving away  and the  reporter's like  let me speak  with you  let me speak  with you  and they  threw like  fucking  their soda  at the girl  and barbecue  sauce and  all kinds of  shit they're  throwing out  their car  window at  this reporter  and  you hear the  woman in the  car yell  white bitch  like it's  always white  like oh  really you  white  motherfucker  like it  always comes 
[02:47:00]  down to  that like  black people  instantly  throwing the  race thing  into any  type of  discussion  argument  whatever's  happening  white people  don't do  that  no it's  not usually  like you  black bastard  or you're  you know  dropping an  n-bomb or  something like  that because  first of all  I think white  people know  not to say  that they're  petrified  and it  just from  what I've  seen  where video  has captured  a moment  of some  type of  interaction  like that 
[02:47:30]  it always  seems to be  the black  person that  first brings  up like  you white  motherfucker  I'll check  out the  white guy  another old  white guy  hey you  white bitch  you know  shit like  that it's  what I've  noticed  and I  notice things  it's what  I do  it's my  job  okay  okay then  psych unit  in Albany  what's up  hey guys  going back  to Friday's  Frankie Valley  thing  go on  YouTube  and Google  Roger Waters 
[02:48:00]  plus lip  syncing  this is  happening a  lot more  than you  think  Roger Waters  is doing  it too  you bet  you  if you  watch the  beginning  of the  12-12-12  show you  see that  he was  actually  whispering  the lyrics  so you  thought you  might want  to go to  the show  and they  cut it  down  immediately  to cover  up the  fact  he was  lip syncing  it  punch it  out  really  what's it  called  on YouTube  it just  said  Roger Waters  lip sync  a few  people  brought that 
[02:48:30]  to my  attention  over the  weekend  Roger Waters  certainly is  lip syncing  these days  I guess  if you're  older  yeah  if you're  older you  just get  out there  and fucking  lip sync  he was just  talk singing  anyway for a  while  yeah  is the  anyone at  home  just kind  of says  it  Travis you  know how to  work the  computer  yeah  lip sync  yeah  oh there  you go  it does  pop up as  a choice 
[02:49:00]  which one  should we  try really  first  how long  do you like  what's pre-recorded  vocals  what's your  pre-recorded  vocals  proof  go with  the one  that says  proof  fuck it  all right  proof  left channel  london o2  arena  right channel  oracle  arena  same exact  i guess it's 
[02:49:30]  left and  right  yes  the same  track  but that's  what they're  trying to  say  he put one  show in  the left  another show  on the right  and you can't  tell  is his  point  yes  it's the same 
[02:50:00]  fucking song  so they  use in  pre-recorded  tracks  pre-recorded  vocals  and he's  using the  exact same  one obviously  why redo it  for every  year  do they have  any video  like of the  lips moving  yeah  yeah  that's what  I like  his lips  but we gotta  take that  guy's word  for it  that that's  two different  shows too  that's the  problem with  that  but it was  exact  wait what 
[02:50:30]  is this  whispering  hold on  pause  but what  is the  that's the  song called  Fletcher  Memorial  oh  it sounds 
[02:51:00]  like he's  whispering  yeah  you can hear  him whispering  whispering into  the mic  huh  you got this  what do they  say on the  description  basically what  what we're  hearing is that  you can hear him  whispering the 
[02:51:30]  song  right  because whoever  the mixer  messed it up  left the mic  up  there's also  another video  who caught  that  this can be  heard more  clearly in  have a cigar  you want to  watch have a  cigar  put on have  a cigar  Trav  yeah because  obviously  you want  I guess  that's the  way where  you know  you can  make it look  real  yeah  oh boy  oh that  sucks  I don't  want to  know this  yeah  it's the 
[02:52:00]  same show  right  it looks  like the  same  yeah  yeah  I think  the guy  did it on  purpose  probably had  it with  Roger  yeah  yeah  maybe Roger  was rude  to him  right  I have no  idea who  that guy  was  they just  pushed  aside  they just  yelled at  him  you turn  it off  when I  saw him  fucking  wanker  yeah  there he 
[02:52:30]  goes  no  no  more  guitar  that's  nice  long  it's a good  thing we  didn't zip  into the  middle of  this  here he  goes  oh my  god  wow 
[02:53:00]  that's his  real track  oh boy  oh my  god  here  here's 
[02:53:30]  this part  let's see  what he  does  that would  be embarrassing  in front of  the other  musicians  yeah  that is  uh  wow  they just  whisper  me  whisper  yes  oh my 
[02:54:00]  god  listen  it's  edgar  singing  i guess 
[02:54:30]  it's easier  for him  to lip  sync  that way  right  to just  barely  say it  i bet  they all  do it  it makes  it look  like  you're  really  singing  right  right  and you  almost have  to strain  to get  it that  low  oh my  god  what the  hell  oh he's  just  uh  but who  wants to  hear the  perfect  record  version  but you'll 
[02:55:00]  just go  and listen  to records  at this  point  is he  even  playing  right at  that point  why is  there power  to the  guitar  wow that's  fucked up  i hope  people understood  that like  that's his  technique  like  yeah  but that's  not what  everyone else  is really  hearing  no they  hear a  booming  fucking  vocal  like  like it's 
[02:55:30]  fucking  the 70s  80s  that sucks  wow  Frankie Valli  i didn't  even do  that  right  Frankie Valli  just mouthed  it  yeah  not a  not a  beat of  sweat  on his  forehead  17 year  old boy  voice  coming out  17 year  old boy  voice  didn't take  one drink  of water  the entire  show  i just  wanted to  hear some  guitar  sorry  Frankie 
[02:56:00]  Valli  huh  Frankie  Valli  was  lip sync  oh  he certainly  was  like he's  fucking  12  yeah  Alicia  Silverstone  is a  weirdo  what's she  up to  she was  the one  that ate  i don't know  what  chewed down  the food for  her own  baby or  something  then did  like a  baby bird  yeah  and she  like  regurgitates  it into 
[02:56:30]  her kid's  mouth  or some  shit  hardcore  vegetarian  which is  fine  crazy  vegetarian  animal  activist  yeah  whatever  and she  was in  clueless  uh  Alicia  Silverstone  has penned  another book  on how to  live the  kind  life  was that  wrong  kind  the wrong  guide  that's  wrong  but her  advice  compiled in  a self  helper  called  the kind  mama  a simple  guide  to  supercharged  fertility  a radiant  pregnancy  a sweeter  birth  and a  healthier  more beautiful 
[02:57:00]  beginning  that's the  title  yes  is being  slammed  as a  compilation  of  cluelessness  get it  uh-huh  get it  in her  guidebook  Silverstone  37  suggests  things like  postpartum  depression  is less  common  among  women  who  adopt  a  vegan  or  plant  based  diet  oh  I thought  adopt  a  vegan  baby  how  would  you know  that  oh  the  clueless  actress  also  suggests  that  veganism  can cure  fertility  problems 
[02:57:30]  illnesses  such as  lupus  and other  medical  conditions  like  jenny  mccarthy  and  veganism  veganism  yeah  veganism  sorry  jesus  you know  hitler  was a  vegetarian  by the  way  that  says  enough  right  there  was  he  really  yeah  yeah  really  says  enough  uh  yeah  like  jenny  mccarthy  silverstone  speaks  against  the  one  size  fits  all  approach  to  childhood  vaccinations  oh  she  don't  like  that  yeah  spread  some  more  diseases  that's  great  you  gotta  I  think  you gotta  give  your  kids  the  shots  you gotta  we just 
[02:58:00]  went in  for more  shots  the other  day  that's  it's  not fun  while there  has not  been a  conclusive  study of  the negative  effects of  such  rigorous  one size  fits all  shoot them  up  schedules  there is  increasing  evidence  from doctors  who have  gotten  distressed  phone calls  from parents  claiming the  child was  never the  same  after receiving  a vaccine  she writes  oh  Alicia  what do you  think that's  about  I don't  know  I think  it's  paranoia  parent  noia  I don't 
[02:58:30]  know  I don't  know  because I'm  not a  parent  and I've  never  had to  take a  kid to  get a  fucking  vaccination  well  it's  horrible  so I've  heard  all of a sudden  you just  pop them  with needles  you're like  what the  fuck  you're  supposed  to be  protecting  me  do you  call him  a pussy  tell him  a voice  tears  off his  fucking  face  before I  wipe  him  off  well  they give  you eyes  like what  the fuck  dude  yeah  what is  this about  I wonder  if there's  a better  way to  do it  I don't  know  I almost  think maybe  the parents  should be  in the room  because the  babies look  right at 
[02:59:00]  you like  fuck  you man  you should  use that  to your  advantage  this is  for not  picking up  your toys  and next  time you  do it  you come  back  and they  jab you  one more  needle  next time  I pick  up my  toys  I go  to the  doctor  what do  you think  it takes  seven year  olds  for shots  extremely  young  they're barely  talking  a couple  words  maybe  or if he  wants to  play with  a dolly  or put  mommy's  shoes on  you tell  him that's  what the  shot's for  wait  did you  put mommy's  shoes on  no I never 
[02:59:30]  put mommy's  shoes on  no  and I never  played with a  dolly  it was a  puppet  did you put  mommy's  shoes on  didn't have  strings on it  yet  no I never  put mommy's  shoes on  I never  put mommy's  shoes on  why would  you bring  it up  like that  because it's  something  you were  sort of  referring to  yourself  no no no  because it's  something  you did  the dolls  thing  without the  strings  no because  if I was  saying you  would do  that to  try to keep  your child  from being  sexually  confused  and all it  would do  is sexually  confuse him  see that was  the twist  yeah I don't  know about  that  I never  put mommy's 
[03:00:00]  shoes  I would  absolutely  tell you  if I put  on mommy's  shoes  Sam you  put on mommy's  shoes  no I never  did  I never  put on mommy's  shoes  I don't think  it was the  opster  why what's  wrong with  you  I never  put on  mommy's  shoes  did you  break the  heels  in them  because you  didn't know  how to walk  properly 
[03:00:30]  no it's  you slide  around  because they  were so  big  that's why  your father  would always  yell at you  like we  were like  why would  his father  always call  him gay  because he  had like  a puppet  but that's  what it  was it  was a doll  and you  were walking  around you  were like the  little girl  from Sixth  Sense doing  your little  play like  oh look  the little  puppet show  and you  had on mommy's  shoes and  your father  trying to give  you a soup  with poison in it  no I must  say I never  had even the  slightest urge to  put on mommy's  shoes  comment Sam 
[03:01:00]  did you put on  her earrings  when you had  the shoes on  no I didn't  have the shoes  or the underpants  or earrings  none of that  did you mistake  her back massager  as a big fake  cigar  and walk around  putting your mouth  and walk around  like you were  smoking a cigar  back massager  mommy's  in mommy's  shoes  I never put  shoes  I never put on  mommy's shoes  put on mommy's  shoes  oh with  mommy's back  massager in his  mouth like a  cigar  mom's funny 
[03:01:30]  tasting cigar  oh my god  definitely  you guys are a  hoot  dad would get  even more upset  because mommy  would think it was  cute that little  Anthony was wearing  her shoes  that's true but  she didn't like  when he would run  out when company  was there  with her  with the fake  cigar and say  why cigars  smell like  doo-doo  she put it  there  because he was  16  inappropriate  I never wore  mommy's shoes  alright I'm sure  everyone will 
[03:02:00]  believe you  don't worry about  you outgrew  mommy's shoes  I think so too  I don't think  they'll bother you  with that one  on twitter  today  you're safe  you're good  you're good  Tony, Teal, and I  that's why  I don't like the  name game  I don't think  there'll be any  photoshops or anything  you'll be fine  nah I know that  I think our  listeners are cool  when it comes to  that stuff  yeah totally  alright  Alicia Silverstone  on the subject  of children  Silverstone refers  to the uterus  as a baby house  that would benefit  from being kept  healthy with her  kind lifestyle  that includes  staying away from  meat 
[03:02:30]  well this is the  first shocker  of the new article  with Alicia Silverstone  dick  she thinks women  should stay away  from tampons  oh yeah  what are they  supposed to do  probably pads  as they lead to  infertility issues  hmm  I like seeing a good  tampon floating around  on the toilet  you like that  why  well that's great  the same for  country love song  I'd shove them up  my ass while I had  on mommy's shoes  oh really 
[03:03:00]  so you're  finally willing to  admit you had  mommy's shoes on  just playing along  I bet you that's  what happened  he ran out like  when company was  there in mommy's  shoes  look mama  half my period  and pulled a tampon  out of his ass  and embarrassed  the family  your dad's like  god damn it  not when people  are over  god damn it  all my co-workers  are here  don't worry everybody  he's just joking  he's a real comedian  he's not a faggot  alright  you think that would  be a buzz kill  for the party  for your daddy  oh boy  for the party  dad's fucking 
[03:03:30]  come walking out  with mommy's shoes  because dad's  friends were a lot  like fucking  Sterling's friends  I think  telling him things  what's wrong  with your kid  Joey  just to be a faggot  I don't care  what you do  just don't put it  on Instagram  Anthony  yeah come on  have your mommy's  shoes on  I never had  mommy's shoes  I swear  let me do  that's cool  that's cool there  little Joe  had a sister  nah  we had Donnie  Donnie and Tony  little sister  Donnie and Tony 
[03:04:00]  no  Tony  I bet they used  to pretend  they were Tony  Orlando and Don  and Joe  would sing  and then Anthony  and Donnie  would be the  backup girls  no  do you think  his dad ever  yelled  bro take care  of your daughter  no  he never wanted  I did get in  trouble though  for standing  on the table  and singing  celebrate  dance to the music  because I was  singing  masturbate  masturbate  dance to the music  because the heels  were poking holes  in the table  no 
[03:04:30]  get those heels  off the top  he was actually  singing it's  raining men  no  no  putting dents  in our wood  table  I didn't even  know what it  meant  mommy shoes  I didn't even  know what  masturbate meant  but I was just  going masturbate  why would you be  bothered by that  dance to me  and he was like  knock it off  stop singing that  why  why would that  be a problem  with everything  else  because I  you don't want  me yelling  masturbate  silverstone  shoes on  no I didn't  have the woman's  shoes on  silverstone is 
[03:05:00]  another celebrity  mom in favor  of placenta  eating  placenta  eating  would you  ever  oh my god  would you  ever try  placenta  no  no  women actually  eat it  women plant  it under a  tree in front  of their house  what is that  about  I don't know  it's gonna grow  placenta  eating  she's into  placenta  eating  oh  I like  polenta  how many guys  you  how many guys  you think  how many guys 
[03:05:30]  you think  got roped  into her  hotness  and then went  oh my god  this is a  strange bird  that shit  right  yep  I hear you  she doesn't wear  deodorant too  which I kind of  like  yeah  perhaps her  most original  bit of advice  silverstone writes  enthusiastically  about elimination  communication  instead of  potty training  elimination  communication  break down  instead of 
[03:06:00]  saying  we're gonna  potty train  it's always  the same  infants who  are left  in their  diapers  all day  get out  of tune  with their  bodies  because they  get used to  walking around  in a toilet  by the time  you want to  take that  diaper away  it can be  pretty difficult  for a small  child to  relearn how  to pay  attention  to this  need  and do  something  about it  she writes  so  what do you  do  she suggests  that  parents should  step away  from the  pampers  that means 
[03:06:30]  they're gonna  be shitting  in their  fucking  pants  is that  what she's  advocating  yes  first of all  everyone doesn't  have the money  she has to  just go out  and buy  new clothes  every time  they get  shit in  them  she just  has a  laundry  machine  full of  shitty  onesies  are you  supposed to  check the  baby often  yeah  maybe that  it's pretty  obvious when  your kid  shits  if they're  shitting their  pants  you really  gotta check  them often  that's pretty  obvious  so step  away from  the pampers  this is  before potty  training  so yeah  I guess 
[03:07:00]  her kid's  just shit  maybe it's  cloth  maybe she  means cloth  typers  she's saying  step away  from the  pampers  cause you  don't want  the kid  used to  like oh  I could  shit  myself  just make  it easier  for yourself  so the  kid would  be like hey  I'm shitting  my pants  this sucks  so why  I go to  toity  well they  get used  to just  walking around  in their  own shit  is what  she's saying  right  so the  other way  if you  don't have  pampers  or diapers  that are  holding it  all in  I guess  what  duty's  starting  to fall  out  the  pants 
[03:07:30]  yeah but  what if  they get  okay  with that  and they  just grow  up being  like yeah  I don't  mind  shitting  in my  pants  yeah it's  fine I  like the  smell  feels good  cool when  it hardens  against my  cheeks  oh it's a little  rolling out the  leg no problem  her body was so  awesome and  fucking clueless  yeah she's hot  to wear that  tight dress  thing  she was  probably  shitting  her  cute little  smile  she's a  weirdo  smile  she's a  weirdo  and crying  the video  there with  fucking  Aerosmith  right  she's still  pretty though  yeah  I like to  smooch with  her  she still  looks pretty  good  she does  look pretty 
[03:08:00]  good but  she's a  strange one  how old is  she 37  yeah  I think  what's his  name from  Lost is in  that crying  video too  Sawyer  yeah I think  so  Sawyer's in  that one  this was  their  giant  resurgence  into  fucking  music  this album  was  giant  yeah  pump  yeah right 
[03:08:30]  is that it  this is okay  this song  was  on MTV  constantly  oh god  um  late 80s  right  this video  I think  it was  early 90s  early 90s  what year  god she was  cute  was she famous  early 90s  not yet  oh this is  before famous  this is before  cool list  oh yeah  yeah this is  before cool list  this is what  made her bones  on this video  on Travis 
[03:09:00]  look how cute  this is what  made her famous  yeah yeah  oh okay  no one knew  her before this  I was trying  I'm a man  to my man  I hope so  I would think so  probably gave it  a good shot  just gave it  just a video  the scene happening  and then the band  singing about it  in another room  yeah look at her  she's a whore  and who's that  that's what's his name  oh is that  Stephen Dorff  it might be Stephen  Dorff before his

[03:10:00]  in the early 2000s  who was that resurgence  oh  they had like  oh  it's my new  obsession  man  you don't like this  how could you not  like pink  why does he say  question  I never noticed  that before  obsession  and question  did we talk about  that before  he thinks he's being  he thinks he's being  cute  can you go back  to question  please  yeah  being on your 
[03:10:30]  chimney  why does he do  that  obsession  and question  would have worked  yeah  why did he have  to like  question  oh my god  I don't want to  close my eyes  from Armageddon  I want to hear  question again  before I move on  please  it's all pink  it's not even  a question  a question  you don't like this  Jim  I do not  what  is that Howard

[03:12:30]  what was that  that uh  my pal Buzzy  found the uh  the uh  the video of me  smoking pot  from the late 80s  oh I saw the clip  I saw the picture  but he's  he's chickening out  cause he's in the video  and he's  he's quite the big deal  these days  you can't say  that he's smoked  the little reefer  in the TV world  so he's trying to figure out  how to like um  edit himself out of the video  and then I'm posting  this fucking thing  yeah  can't he just have it  edited out  that's all  but you see the opster  fucking smoking pot  just pixelate himself 
[03:13:00]  nice  it's on my instagram  look at you  doing that little hit  of the reefers  look how  look how sadly  thin our  our reefer was  back then  that's bad  we had no money  a little roach  you're trying to  there's nothing  in the  your eyes too  jesus  they're all  I used to get  pretty chinky  you are pretty  you want to say  you get pretty chinky  probably not  I apologize  for saying chinky  they used to say  let's get all  chinese eyes  chinese eyes  whatever  because you'd be 
[03:13:30]  all squinting  and just go  yeah  motherfucker  I'm so  stoned  so that's a  screen cap  from the video  I'll release  another screen cap  from the video  that's even  douchier  have you seen  the video  not in many  many years  I remember  the tape  I've wanted  to get a copy  of that forever  and he finally  found it  he went through  some of his old stuff  you can edit him out  my friend Buzzy  has been taping shit  from like  fuck man  early 80s  he was way ahead  of everybody  nice  he's got the  opster on the video 
[03:14:00]  he's got  he's got a videotape  Sam  of Andre the Giant  we were in the front row  watching Andre the Giant  in Rochester  that's when I tell the story  and I swear to this day  it's true  that up close  Andre the Giant  had flies  that actually followed him  I swear to you  it was one of the most  these flies  would not leave him  alone  the entire time  he was in the ring  and walking to  and fro the ring  it was strange  why'd you send him that video  he probably will  it'll probably give me  a little taste  of a lot of things  but we're front row  as Andre the Giant's 
[03:14:30]  wrestling in Rochester  what year did he die?  93 January  oh yeah  this goes back to  fuck  it could be  87  I don't know  87  88 maybe  do you wish  you would have met him?  I would have liked  to have met Andre  but I mean  you know  he was past his prime  by then  8788  he was already  his knees were gone  oh yeah  he barely did anything  it was just amazing  to see this monster  of a guy  he was fucking huge  yeah  did they exaggerate 
[03:15:00]  his height?  yeah  they used to have  even though  he was already  a giant  Vince would have him  stand on a box  when he stood  next to Vince  to make him look  there's that famous  picture of Vince  and Andre the Giant  where it looks like  Vince is 5'4  yeah he's looking  up at him  and Vince  we've met him  he's about what  6'1 6'2 probably  at least yeah  and he looks  look at this  that's hilarious  you can't look  because they won't  give us a visual element  so I apologize for that  but we're going to 
[03:15:30]  continue doing the radio  show the way we think  it should be done  with visuals  yeah he's looking  right up at him  wow  we are looking at  a picture of  Vince McMahon  who is 6'2  and I mean  if you do the math  that would make Andre  at least 8 foot  2 inches tall  and he's probably  what just over 7  I think he was  between 7'2 and 7'4  you think  is he legitimately  that tall  probably a legit 7  I would say  between 7 and 7'2  yeah that's what  I'm saying  legit 7 to 7'2  but Vince was brilliant  he made him stand  on a box  so it was that 
[03:16:00]  much of a difference  yeah and then  Vince would spread  his legs  and shoot from  the waist up  so they were even  shorter  his own legs  yeah the announcers  spread their legs  so they look shorter  so the wrestlers  look bigger  they always do that  yeah like he  like this  and then they shoot  from the waist up  fuck that  if they hire me  man I'm on my  tippy fucking toes  oh man  you're supposed to  put over the wrestling  then you're fired  and the cameramen  don't say  I guess you have to  sign away everything  well I mean  it's not like  that's you know  what are they  going to be like  oh I have a big 
[03:16:30]  expose  the announcers  are spreading  their legs  thank god we have  Sam to give away  all their secrets  I didn't know  that  because you try  to get a job  with the WWE  creep  it's not like  it's a John Stossel  revealing the secrets  it's a big one  though Sam  you think so  yes  yeah well  fuck him right  I got that from a guy  who got it from Jerry Lawler  so there  would you leave this show  to do it  if Vince wanted to  hire you  and have you like  run this wrestling thing  oh my god  you have to run it  yeah like  just run this wrestling show 
[03:17:00]  where you talk to them  and you help them up  with storylines  oh yeah  I mean it was a good job  good riddance  yeah  fucker  good riddance  to old rubbish  if it was a bad job  good riddance  I'm sleepy  let's go to Todd  in Pennsylvania  Todd  Todd  how you doing Anthony  oh hi  Opie brought you on  I said Todd  and you said hello  to Anthony  alright  I have something 
[03:17:30]  to say to Anthony  got a question for you buddy  when you were wearing  mommy's shoes  did you click your heel  together and say  there's no place  like Elmo  see  you're implying  that I wore mommy's shoes  which I never did  were they red though  for real  what color  were mommy's shoes  I couldn't tell you  I didn't even  think about mommy's shoes  did you wear the smart  beige ones  didn't even  think about it  did you wear an apron  with them  no aprons  no shoes  no mommy's clothes  you wore the shoes  no jewelry  but there's actual  pictures of you  wearing mommy's shoes 
[03:18:00]  online  that is my  childish  head  right  superimposed  on the body  of another child  wearing red mommy shoes  I don't see  where it's superimposed  sir  I do  they didn't have  photoshopped  they didn't have  photoshopped back then  so it couldn't have  been superimposed  oh shit  yeah  but  beavis cumia  really  oh that little fucker  I hate when my cat  is photoshopping me  your cat is tweeting 
[03:18:30]  what the hell's going on  let's say hi to  I don't know  Evan looks like  Long Island  what's up Evan  Indiana  oh yeah  long time listener  first time caller  no one gives a shit  love that  yeah thanks man  I was curious if  you were familiar  with the  Irishman tune  dude looks like a lady  oh  yeah you should like that  song  dude looks like a lady  I do not  you know the beat  of it is good  and yes of course  I understand why  you're pointing it 
[03:19:00]  out to me  and I don't think  the irony has been  lost  I don't  no  it's kind of like  a toe tapper  it's okay  I don't love it  the chorus is good  but I don't like  the regular song  no  no  I like it  because it makes  me think of  Mrs. Doubtfire  oh right  they're doing a  sequel to that  yeah they are  they are  thank god  is it going to be  black  no I think  wow  oh I thought 
[03:19:30]  it was one of those  that's like  Mrs. Doubtfire 2  where you know  Martin  or something  or like Cedric  the Entertainer  maybe  or it could be  what's his name  that's always  dressing like a woman  Tyler Perry  Tyler Perry's  Tyler Perry's  Mrs. Doubtfire 
[03:20:00]  Mrs. Doubtfire  Mrs. Doubtfire  yes  and uh  that was a huge  hit for hours  don't want to  close my eyes  don't want to  fall asleep  cause I miss you  is that a good song  let me hear that  I don't know that one  it's so bad  I don't know it  I've saw the movie 
[03:20:30]  I just can't think of it  a little love scene  I don't mind a love song  it's terrible  dude looks like a lady  yuck  yeah  sounds like something  Uncle Paul would yell  Joe for Tuesday  on your home of  Ragnarok  yeah  send this one out  to little Jimmy  Armageddon's another movie  that's just fucking  it's as bad as 
[03:21:00]  Independence Day  I don't remember it  the end of the movie  you know  they fucking save the world  and land  the shuttle  and like  how does the stripper  that was  fucking around  let Steve Buscemi  get on the fucking  landing strip  to run up to him  and hug him  oh yeah  does she even know  Steven Tyler  looks like Jennifer Love  Hewitt in this video  oh  it's hot  sexy  yeah  you would kiss  Steven Tyler  in this video  yeah  well look at those lips  you would have to  and if you closed your eyes  they would feel like  women's lips 
[03:21:30]  so you're alright  you're alright  with that one  they're pouty  yeah  make love for them  pillowy  what's wrong with this song  I like this  it's nice  but these songs  don't bother me  there's better songs  but  pink bothers me  it's alright actually  when they had their  big comeback  how many years  did they get  in a row  because  I mean  for the Aerosmith fans  out there  they did an album  called  Done With Mirrors 
[03:22:00]  I think it was called  it was a complete  and utter bust  and people thought  that was it  for the band  Done With Mirrors  Done With Mirrors  thank you  and then they  had the huge  comeback with  Love in an Elevator  was the first one  right  Love in an Elevator  was 89  and then they had  Janie's Got a Gun  right  and then  one after another  for years  What It Takes  was big on the rock charts  yep  The Other Side  was number one  yep  The Other Side  which one's that one  you know all these  how's that go  I heard it  Sam won't get it  Remember Ragdoll  Ragdoll was up there 
[03:22:30]  oh yeah that's okay  Living on the Edge  but when did they  start fading out again  so 89 they started  happening again  I like Dream On  and they can go  fuck themselves  that's the 70s  70s for that shit  97 was pink  yeah but that was  that was the  comeback though  that was the  number one rock song  that was a huge hit  didn't they fade out  around like 94  and then come back  around 97  that's what I'm asking  I don't remember  no 94 was crazy  right  and then  I think they made it  almost to 97  so I think they went  eight straight years  with hit after hit 
[03:23:00]  after hit  well 97 was  Fallen in Love  is Hard on the Knees  that was big  but what was between  94 and 97  nothing  they did a  Greatest Hits album  that was that  dead area  yeah  a little break  a little break ski  a little break  they were probably  touring the world  at that point  98  that was their  only number one  so they started  fading out in 97  98  yeah I mean  well 98 was  I Don't Want to Miss a Thing  that's their only  number one  oh yeah  so from 98 to now  they haven't really  done much  none of those  other songs made it  to number one 
[03:23:30]  not outside of the  rock charts  loving an elevator  no  so they've been  wow  so they  they faded away  for the past  16 years  all of a sudden  again  Jesus  and they had  an eight or nine  year run  and that  and that was  that was  after they faded away  the first time  they've been around  a while  amazing  that's an amazing  career  they're tremendous  I'm not a fan  but they are  Jaded was big  and that was 2001  yeah  Jaded was big  how does Jaded go  huge song  yeah  just give me one line  or you can just say it  Jaded 
[03:24:00]  oh you sing like an angel  just zip to the middle  I don't know  yeah this is big  this is one of those  TRL songs  I don't even care  I'm done with this  you know what I've  listened to a lot  the Mexican guy  who did  the great Axl  oh  I listened to a lot  of his stuff 
[03:24:30]  oh you did  yeah  doesn't he have a  what were people  saying on Twitter  Dio  he does fucking  Dio  really  and he does  I think that was  the one people  were talking about  over the week  but he does  his own voice  he just sings  like Axl  but he does  an amazing cover  of Diamonds and Rust  too  you like Juan the Beast  Juan the Beast  is fucking phenomenal  and he was singing  he does this thing  where he talks  too  because people  have been questioning  the Axl voice  so there's one video  where he talks  and he actually  just sings a little  acapella  so you can hear  that it really  is his voice  he's not lip syncing 
[03:25:00]  you want to hear  it Live and Let Die  no his Diamonds and Rust  is tremendous  his Priest cover  it's  I want to hear  a little Dio  I'll play on some Dio  he does a great Dio  what Dio  what kind of Dio  does he do  Rainbow in the Dark  yeah  that would be  a good one  that one  that one  that one  is a tough  fucking song  I haven't heard  this one  oh bullshit  yeah  that's the word  at 3am  Rainbow in the Dark  you think he's 
[03:25:30]  going to pull it off  he won't sing it  exactly like Dio  because his voice  is different  but his holy diver  is the shit  holy shit  wow  this guy rules 
[03:26:00]  he was cold  lost my home  to the shadows  of the night  no sign  of the morning  coming  you've been  after your own  like your rainbow  in the dark  jeez  he's a fucking 
[03:26:30]  this little chubby  mexican  it's like listening  to the actual  who covers  it's great  he's sweating  a lot  but it seems  after this  he's a big boy  he's a big boy  wow 
[03:27:00]  that's good  that's so funny  that's fucking  cool  wow  that's pretty cool  that's right  who else does he do  he does an interesting  Diamonds and Rust  find that one 
[03:27:30]  again he doesn't  sound like Halford  but I like the fact  that he's kind of  doing it his own  but he does a really  good cover of that  he just happens  to sound like Axl  that's why he sings  Guns and Roses  and it sounds  like Guns and Roses  but his voice  is just naturally  like that  though he's trying  to sound like  Judas Priest  in this one  in the style  of Judas Priest  or maybe as opposed  to Joan Baez's version 
[03:28:00]  yeah that's true  oh right right right  good point  yeah that's what  they say at the  karaoke  I'll be down  here comes  the ghost  again  but that's  not unusual  as stressed  not the moon  is full  and you decided  to crawl  and hear us  in 
[03:28:30]  and on the  telephone  hearing  the voice  alone  you can hear  how he wants  to break into  Axl  yeah  yeah  but once in a while  he'll say something  with like a little  Mexican accent  whatever the accent  is and you can  tell that that's  completely him  wow 
[03:29:00]  that's pretty  freaking  welcome to the  titty twister  he's uh  any more  Guns N' Roses  to wrap this up  yeah  oh what other  Guns N' Roses  I just heard the one  he won't do  Paradise City  for some reason  I don't know why  he said that  I was watching  I don't know why  I was just watching  this guy's videos  let's see  we got  Sweet Child  we've done  Welcome  to the Jungle  Civil War

[03:47:00]  Opie!  Come here, give me some love.  Little brown sugar, Opie!  James!  That was only until Wheezy came along.  All right, all right.  The beauty that was Wheezy.  All right.  Oh, if only I could be George Jefferson.  I'll move you on up.  Now you've gone too far, man.  You said it, man.  Yeah, how about that Aunt Esther, Opie? 
[03:47:30]  Shut up.  Come here, heathen!  I could never squeeze out syrup out of that Aunt Jemima bottle without thinking,  wow, what a hot babe.  I'd lose my syrup.  Well, you heard it here, folks.  Opie, hots for Florida from good times.  Stole the Playboy.  That Playboy I never saw, but I guess it's in Opie's personal collection.  The one with Florida. 
[03:48:00]  James, I'm making him Playboy!  All right, son of a...  Look at the picture we got on the wall.  Check this out.  James!  There she is.  Esther Roll!  Wow.  She is truly dino-wine.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah.  That's chocolate thunder.  James! 
[03:48:30]  Here's the picture, Opie.  Are you feeling that tingle?  Yeah!  Here it is, Opie.  Time to feel free.  Anytime you're up and under.  Not getting hassled.  Not getting hustled.  Keeping your head up the water.  Opie loves mama.  Dino man!  Good times!  Easy credit rip-off.

[03:49:30]  After James got killed, remember that?  She would have liked a guy like you.  Shut up.  You'd have fit good in the projects.  You'd have to suffer the scrutiny of Michael, the younger brother.  Yes!  Yes!  Remember how angry he was.  I don't think Opie would have cut the mustard.  His hair and everything.  Mama!  Why are you dating that white boy?  He's very nice. 
[03:50:00]  Now, come on.  Let mama go out with Opie.  James!  Mama, he's the devil.  Well, he's showing you the devil in bed.  Wait till I tell Walona what he did to me.  Of course, he can't stack up the James, Larry Count.  Say what?  Say what?  The Opie and Anthony Show is back. 
[03:50:30]  On Sirius XM.  Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.  Oh, what's becoming a real?  Ride the tiger.  You can see a stretch, but you know he's clean.  Oh, don't you see what I mean?  Gotta get away.  Holy Diver.  More from Juan the Beast. 
[03:51:00]  I love this verse for Holy Diver.  That's good.  Yeah.  Anytime I hear this now, that just reminds me of that South Park episode.  Where they were playing Holy Diver.  I don't know, it's just like...  It was them as cartoon characters.  That's funny.  All they played was Holy Diver. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Go to Juan the Beast on YouTube.  He's got a lot of songs, right?  Yeah, he's fucking great.  We like him a lot.  Brent in D.C.  What's going on, Brent?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Brenty.  What's up?  Yeah, he does Guns N' Roses, the Welcome to the Jungle, and it's really fucking good.  Did we... 
[03:52:00]  Oh, boy.  He does Guns N' Roses, this guy?  Did we do that one?  We did Sweet Child of Mine, right?  We didn't do Welcome to the Jungle.  We didn't do Welcome.  Yeah, he doesn't do Welcome to the Jungle.  We're looking now.  Yeah, he comes right up.  He's standing like in a recording video.  Nope.  Don't see it at all, actually, on his YouTube page.  Yeah, not here.  You don't see it either, right, Sam?  It's just not here, sir.  Yeah, it's not here.  And, uh...  Yeah, nope.  Must be thinking of another guy.  Hello? 
[03:52:30]  Brent?  Sir?  Sir?  Sir?  I heard you!  All right.  All right.  What does he do special with Welcome to the Jungle?  No, it's just...  He's just...  Good, you know...  All right, let's listen to that now.  That's a good actual.  All right.  Just Google Wanda Beast.  It'll come right up.  Yeah, you do that.  All right.  We're busy.  We're probably overdoing it with Wanda Beast.  We are, but...  What are you going to do?  We make stars out of people.  Yeah.  That's right.  No, we don't.  We're going to get millions of people. 
[03:53:00]  Maybe this is not actually guns playing it.  Nice.  Nice.  Welcome to the Jungle.  We got money games. 
[03:53:30]  What the fuck?  We got everything you want.  Honey, we know the names.  We are the people that can find whatever you may need.  If you got the money, honey, we got you.  You're the dickiest hit the junk code.  Welcome to the jungle.  What's your freak into your...  Sh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  the knees, knees.  Wow.  Whoa.  Sounds nothing like them.  What do you please?  Welcome to the jungle  He's so good  Wouldn't you swear this is Axl though? 
[03:54:00]  I would watch this guy  Do a tribute band  Lead singer of a tribute band  Any day  He'd be fucking great  Welcome to the jungle  Won't you feel my  My  Must have been seen  I wanna hear you scream  Holy shit  It's not good at all  Oh come on  Doesn't sound like him  Wow 
[03:54:30]  Amazing  It looks fake when he starts singing  Welcome to the jungle  It's like get that voice coming at him  You're the one to live like an animal  In the jungle where we play  If you've got our hopes up for what you need  You'll take anything to me  You can have anything you want  But you're better than anything for me  In the jungle  Welcome to the jungle  What you're bringing to you  It is  It is  Whoa 
[03:55:00]  I wanna watch you play  It's hilarious  Holy shit  How does he do that?  All I want to do is watch this.  I know.  There's something enjoyable about a guy just singing like a professional when he's not.  I don't know why.  Why do I like this more than I would actually enjoy watching Axl?  What does he do?  Because Juan starts on time, maybe?  Three hours later.  I would swear that that was Axl.  I know.  If I didn't know better.  Could you do one more?  Run to the Hills.  I love Run to the Hills. 
[03:55:30]  I love Run to the Hills.  People are saying you've got to hear Run to the Hills.  All right.  Nothing like Axl.  We'll finally stop.  Sounds like Axl.  It's Juan the Beast on YouTube.  Just jealous, Chip.  Chip likes someone else getting the attention.  Yes.  Is that the Facebook page, too?  Run to Juan the Beast?  Yeah, I think so.  It's all linked on our Facebook page and Twitter, which is O&A Show.  Beautiful.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good song. 
[03:56:00]  It is a good song.  It's about running with hills in the background.  Right.  I know.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  White man came across the sea.  He brought his faith and mystery.  He killed our tribe.  He killed our creed.  He took our game for his own need.  We fought him hard.  We fought him well.  Out of the place, we gave him hell. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, yeah. 
[03:57:00]  Run to the hills, run upon your life, run to the hills, run upon your life, soldier blue in the barren place.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[03:57:30]  That's pretty good.  Good job, Juan the Beast.  Actually sounding, but it's fucking good.  I'm just laughing.  What happened?  Apparently, Opie, you didn't notice something about Anthony on your Letterman appearance.  Oh, what?  What?  I can't believe that we didn't notice this.  Oh, no.  How did we never notice this?  I was hoping no one would ever see this.  I haven't looked at those pictures in a few years.  You know what?  You're probably looking at your faces in your suits.  Maybe years later, this probably pops up, but I know what it's going to be.  It's really...  There's us a Letterman.  Oh, God.  You've got mommy's shoes on. 
[03:58:00]  I'm wearing mommy's shoes.  You wore mommy's shoes to Letterman?  Look at that.  Wow.  Why did you do that?  You've got mommy's shoes on.  Why are you telling Dave, I've never worn mommy's shoes?  And he's laughing at you because he knows you're lying.  And I certainly do have feminine feeties.  Oh, my God.  I've got my pussies in those heels, don't I?  Yeah.  Wow.  Mommy's shoes.  Damn.  Mommy's shoes.  What happened there?  Huh.  Fucking good.  We're going to finally talk about the guy that wants to fuck a horse or what? 
[03:58:30]  Are we going to leave here without talking about this today?  Guy that wants to fuck a horse.  Yeah.  Most people just fuck a horse.  They don't want to fuck a horse.  If you want to fuck a horse, you fuck a horse.  Well, we got the horse on the line.  Oh, do we?  Incidentally, yes.  I am not a horse.  You are the back end of one, though.  Yes.  I am not a horse.  She, again, just rose in the literal.  She's sharp, though.  I'm not a horse.  She knew we were talking about her.  And she knew she wasn't a horse.  So, there you go. 
[03:59:00]  I want to comment on the music being played.  Why?  Mike.  Hello.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  Mikey boy.  Make it quick.  We're busy.  Hey, man.  Have you all heard the remake of Rainbow in the Dark by Corey Taylor?  He did that tribute album by Dio's wife.  He did a pretty good job.  You know, I did not hear that.  Wait, what's the story there?  Well, they probably just did it for...  I don't know the guy.  Corey Taylor.  Yeah, Corey Taylor from Slipknot and Stone Sour.  He did a really damn good job of it. 
[03:59:30]  It just came out about two, three weeks ago.  He did a really good job, if y'all can find it.  All right.  It's worth playing.  Y'all can.  I don't know.  You don't have a high-pitched voice like Ronnie Dio, but...  No.  He's good, though.  Corey Taylor's really...  Corey Taylor can fucking take his ass off, man.  All right.  We're good.  Also, I wanted to say...  I wanted a big compliment to Jimmy.  I saw a picture of him on Facebook from y'all's 20th anniversary show.  Y'all's.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you are looking fucking awesome, dude.  You can fuck, man.  Thanks very much.  Ripped, Jimmy.  And you guys are looking good, too, man. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, look at you.  You are looking good, too.  I'm getting there.  Anthony, Anthony...  This is not going to be the final product, sir, but I'm almost there.  There you go.  Anthony, the alcohol is doing wonders, my friend.  Thank you, sir.  There's a lot of flirting going on in the show.  There really is.  We're all just getting our compliments.  All right.  Very sexy all of a sudden.  I swear to God, I didn't know Corey's name from Slipknot.  Corey.  Corey Taylor.  I'm embarrassed to say that.  Yes.  Corey Taylor, let's hear this. 
[04:00:30]  That's all right.  This was a fun song, man.  Back in the day.  Dio sang the fuck out of this song.  Dio was fucking great.  God, was he great.  Wow.  That sounds good.  That sounds good.  It's nice. 
[04:01:00]  Here it comes.  I like it. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, really good job.  Fuck yeah.  Very cool.  All right.  Let's talk about this guy who wants to have sex with a horse.  Ah.  Out of Phoenix.  Now, I don't understand why you would say this.  Huh?  How does anyone know he wants to have sex with a horse?  Well, he was on Craigslist.  Oh.  Craigslist.  Craigslist.  Oh, yeah, I did hear.  I didn't read the story, though.  Phoenix man arrested for using Craigslist to find sex with horse. 
[04:02:00]  Horses don't check Craigslist.  No, that's true.  Yeah, it's with Ed's List.  It's with Ed's List.  Horses can't do that.  Oh, God.  She's right.  She's right.  Well, it's the truth.  You know, horses, you know, animals can't do that stuff.  Do what?  Check Craigslist and, you know, and go over there.  No, but you're proof that pigs can talk on the phone.  Nothing on that?  Jimmy.  That's too mean.  No, no.  Wait, I heard that horses can check Craigslist. 
[04:02:30]  Well, maybe if you're Mr. Ed, or Mr. Ed's ancestors.  Ancestors.  Oh, God.  Once it came before Mr. Ed.  They're all dead for so long.  Yeah, and the internet wasn't around for the ancestors.  Remember Mr. Ed would be, like, painting.  He'd come out and he'd have, like, a beret on.  Right.  And he'd have the brush in his mouth and he'd be painting on a...  That poor horse. 
[04:03:00]  Like, I'm just painting.  I would love to know what they did to that horse to make him do those silly little things.  I know, to make him do all that wacky stuff.  He'd be playing the guitar or something with his mouth.  Like a rainbow in the dark.  What?  I'm wearing a guitar.  Can I tell you something?  You always do.  The horse's mouth...  No, no, seriously.  This is how they got the horse's mouth to move.  They put peanut butter in his mouth.  A little trivia for you right there.  How can we get your mouth to stop moving?  Yeah.  But they put peanut butter in his mouth to make his mouth move. 
[04:03:30]  Oh, yeah?  See, I thought he was really talking.  No, no, no, no.  Wait, wait, that horse wasn't really talking?  See, I thought he was really talking, but Lady Di says no.  Now, Lady Di, supposedly...  The horse didn't talk.  I read a book and supposedly that horse did talk.  Oh, really?  Did you?  No, no, no.  But it wasn't as many words as they make him say on the show.  He could only say about 2,000 words, and they needed more for the show, so that's when  they used the peanut butter truck. 
[04:04:00]  That's what I read in this book.  Exactly, exactly.  Yeah.  They made the horse's mouth move by putting peanut butter in his mouth.  Oh, yeah?  Why would that make his mouth move?  It could make your mouth move with a shotgun.  Back and to the left.  I'm very, very serious about this.  Back and to the left.  Yeah?  I checked the Internet about it.  And that's how they made the horse's mouth actually move like that.  No, that's not true.  Really?  Yeah, we're online right now.  It says that Mr. Ed actually knew 2,000 words. 
[04:04:30]  No, I don't believe it, Opie.  I'm telling you.  What do you want from me, man?  I'm just reading what I see on the Internet.  Oh, wait.  You're reading that on the Internet.  But I'm just telling you, I went on the same Internet that you went on.  Oh, same Internet.  But that's Opie's Internet.  Right.  What are you talking about?  Were you a hacker?  It's the same thing.  I want to say hi to Dr. Steve today, who's actually listening live right now.  Happy birth.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  He says, I'm driving home to change clothes after dumping a diarrhea stool sample all over my pants. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Don't do that to me.  It's always about you.  It's not about you.  How many beers have you drank today, you fucking wash?  Let me see.  I went out last night, and I got beer.  And I had to go to another liquor store.  By the way, I have to get a mug.  It's 10 a.m.  Why, did you pass a bad check at the other place? 
[04:05:30]  Oh, you're deadbeat.  No, they were closed.  It was Sunday.  So, you had to find a liquor store that's open on a Sunday.  Yeah, you don't have a problem.  Yeah, and I know exactly where it was.  Of course you did.  The liquor gallery on Amore Avenue.  The liquor gallery.  She goes to the gallery.  The liquor gallery.  I don't know why that's funny, but it is.  It sounds like a horrible place.  I went to the liquor gallery.  Who refers to the liquor store by the actual name of the store?  Right.  No one. 
[04:06:00]  I'm going to the liquor store.  No, because that's like everything there.  It was open later than everyone else.  Please tell us the hours that they're open, because I think our audience needs to know  when they can get liquor at the liquor gallery.  The liquor gallery is open.  Of course he's going to answer that.  10 at night?  Yeah.  5.30 a.m.?  9.30 a.m. until 10 a.m.  No one gives a fuck.  It's only open for a half hour? 
[04:06:30]  And then after that, I found out my friend Ronnie.  You guys remember him?  Who?  No.  Oh, Ronnie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I swear I have no idea who Ronnie is.  Yeah.  You have no idea?  No.  Yes.  He was the guy that, uh...  His, his, his, um...  All right, let's put it this way.  Oh, God.  His...  No, seriously.  This is painful.  Um, they know him as Ponytail around O'Moore Avenue.  Oh, Ponytail. 
[04:07:00]  Around what?  Did you believe this conversation?  Can you believe?  How do you remember the...  Ponytail down on fucking...  Okay, of course.  Ponytail.  Why would we, why would we know this or give a shit?  Does he hang out at the liquor gallery, though?  Yeah.  Can you find him at the liquor...  He was there.  Yeah.  Oh, so Ponytail, what?  He...  Harry?  He works...  So Ponytail Harry works at the liquor gallery? 
[04:07:30]  Ronnie works at the liquor gallery.  But who's Ponytail?  What about his brother Harry?  Well, no, his nickname...  Ronnie's nickname is Ponytail because he always has a ponytail.  Blowjob, blowjob per, uh, six-pack?  Did you understand that, Aunt?  She's explaining to you why his nickname is Ponytail.  Oh, wow.  I wonder why.  I wonder why.  And now she's going to repeat it.  Aunt didn't hear you.  Why do they call him Ponytail?  I don't, I don't understand that one.  They call him Ponytail because he has a ponytail all the time.  Oh. 
[04:08:00]  That makes sense.  Marion knows him.  Oh.  Do you get Marion on the phone?  Oh, great.  Marion knows Ponytail from the liquor gallery.  Can we get that tough guy Marion on the phone today?  Yeah.  Where's that dude?  Confirmation.  She might be working.  I don't know.  By the way, my bit's slightly different than, uh, Bob Levy's.  So, what?  And then I found out that he went over to the Lamplight Tavern and had a couple of drinks. 
[04:08:30]  So I said, okay, I think I'll go there myself and have a few drinks.  Of course.  Why wouldn't you?  Someone mentions a bar, you have to go to it.  The liquor store clerk will probably be happy.  Paplov's rhinoceros.  Joits him in a bar.  They love me over there.  Are you kidding me?  Of course they do.  Of course.  They love me over there.  We love you here.  You just can't take out a checkbook.  No.  No.  You didn't get mugged?  No, no, no.  I did not get mugged.  Oh, right.  I was wondering if you got mugged because that's happened to you. 
[04:09:00]  Right.  Or allegedly.  But that's the last time it's going to happen to me.  Oh, yeah?  How do you know?  That'll be it with that one.  How do you know?  No, seriously.  Why?  What are you doing to protect yourself?  What am I doing to protect myself?  That's the question presented to you.  By the way, I want to say, hold on.  I want to say face to the Todd Show today.  It's about time.  Because we're keeping it local.  Yeah.  Look at the gallery.  Fucking.  Look at the gallery.  Ponytail. 
[04:09:30]  Ponytail bill.  And fucking.  Because he wears a ponytail down on some street.  I don't even know.  But that street was local.  It was local.  A lot of local references today.  Take that, Todd.  Lady Di.  What?  What does this all mean?  Yeah.  What are we supposed to take away from this conversation that'll make us better people?  I hung around until the bar closed last night.  She closed.  And Bill was pissed off at me.  You closed the bar.  I closed the bar.  Of course you did. 
[04:10:00]  Basically, yeah, I did.  That hunk of shit bill?  Yeah.  So, Lady Di.  It's not a hunk of shit.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  You didn't answer me.  What are you doing to protect yourself against muggers now?  What am I doing to protect myself?  Okay.  Let me see.  Not going back to that chicken place that I used to go to.  Oh, is that what happens to people?  They get mugged and keep going back and getting mugged at the same place?  That I don't know.  I have no idea. 
[04:10:30]  So you can't say it's not going to happen again?  I don't even have any idea.  I don't have any idea if anybody else got mugged after me at that place.  But I'm not going back there again to get any food again.  Why not?  Why not?  That's the reason.  Why?  It's not good?  Because I might get mugged again.  The fuck?  How do they wreck chicken?  Staying away from black people?  How do they wreck chicken?  Why wouldn't you go back there to eat more?  No, I don't want to. 
[04:11:00]  You're fucking racist.  You're a racist.  I'm not a racist.  I'm a racist.  You don't want to go to a chicken place.  Because there's black people there that might mug you.  You're a fucking racist.  Just living in a...  Hold on.  I was stalling for a reason.  I'm not that bad at radio.  Marion.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you?  Hi, Marion.  Hi, Marion.  Hi, Marion.  Hey, Diana, what's this that you went to Elmar?  Are you having a last night? 
[04:11:30]  What's it like, Ronnie?  Yeah, I did.  What the hell?  Why?  Why?  Because...  How did you go to Elmar close around here?  This would make a great alarm clock.  The liquor stores were closed around this area, so I went over to Elmar having you.  She's trying to get some dick from Ponytail.  Marion, would you get her off her back?  Ponytail's good for a deep dick in late at night.  Right.  I love Ponytail.  Not that way, but I love him.  You take that dick, though, right?  You went to the lamp light and had a couple drinks? 
[04:12:00]  Yeah, what are you going to do about it, tough guy?  Yes, I did.  You tell her.  Bill gave me the money.  Tell her to put up your dukes.  Right.  Bill gave me the money.  Bill did.  No, Bill gave me the money.  Bill called me last night and told me you keep stealing it from the ATM.  What?  He called me the thought.  No, you keep taking his money from the ATM machine.  No, I don't do that.  Oh, shit. 
[04:12:30]  How do you get money to drink?  Some tough love from the tough guy.  How do you get money to drink then, Di?  Right.  He called me last night.  Let me tell you, he called me last night right after.  I'm not going to say it because my mother was in the hospital.  Why?  What's up with her?  Is she all right?  She got sick.  She got sick.  But after I got off the phone with her, Bill calls me up and says, Marion, you know, and  I'm just looking off the phone with the doctors and nurses at the hospital for my mom, and  I'm like, Bill, what do you want?  Diana's taking money from me from the ATM. 
[04:13:00]  We got to get her into rehab.  Right.  No, we.  We tried that.  So now you're stealing money.  You're stealing money.  Slow down.  To drink.  You took more than what he told you to take.  Why?  Is that true, Di?  Answer the question.  He told me.  No, no, no.  Diana, he told me you went to Amora Avenue.  Shut up.  Whoa.  Oh, shit.  What are you doing?  Roaring around.  What are you doing?  Roaring around Amora Avenue.  Oh. 
[04:13:30]  I'm not roaring around.  Wait, what?  Diana, it's the first time you went to Amora Avenue in how many years?  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got to know what goes on on that avenue.  Uh-huh.  What happens on that avenue that she hasn't been there in a while?  Yeah, I don't know.  But the thing is, she hasn't been there.  Are you trying to tell us that she might be, you know, a street walker?  She might be looking for money.  Looking for money.  Looking for somebody to buy a drink.  Oh, so she's blowing people for money? 
[04:14:00]  Right.  I don't know what she's doing.  But it's safe to say that you're thinking it.  Right.  Hold it.  Hold it a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I'm not worried about you, Marion.  Marion, hold on a minute.  What's wrong with Ponytail Ronnie?  Right.  Ronnie's good looking.  What's the point of time?  With the ponytail.  You got to fuck up.  Oh!  Oh, man.  That means Marion's dropping some truth bombs. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Listen to me.  I went over to Amore Avenue, first of all.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  To get, you know, to find an open liquor store.  All right.  Which, yeah, that's not the only liquor store.  Not too far from your house.  Gallery Liquors.  We know it.  There's something going on here.  So, hold on.  Ponytail.  That, that, what is it?  Maury?  Harry.  Harry Avenue?  Yeah.  Elmore Avenue.  Elmore Avenue.  So, so that's a sketchy avenue.  What, what goes on there?  A little, uh, little, oh, forget it. 
[04:15:00]  This would be really good if you were able to fucking direct it.  It's impossible.  You think she's hooking?  Yeah, that's what Marion's hinting toward.  Oh.  She said, you know, trying to get guys to buy her drinks.  What does that mean?  Because she's not a looker.  So, that means she's got to probably give up the, the hiney hole or something.  What's the road?  She went over probably to the Blythe.  I forgot her name.  In Maury?  The Hershey Highway, I think.  The Hershey Highway.  The guy, I think so.  It's on the Hershey Highway.  All right, Marion, I want to talk, I want to talk to Marion, Lady Di, and if you don't 
[04:15:30]  shut the fuck up, I'm hanging up on you.  Marion, what happens on this avenue?  Nothing.  There's a little people that she knows that come back in the day.  Right.  That hang out there.  Wait, are these, when you say back in the day, are you talking about the homeless days  when she was giving up a...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There are some people that hang out there.  She was sucking hobo dick.  And she was sucking cock.  Honestly, Ronnie is a cute guy.  But you're talking about back in the days when she used to sell her mouth and vagina, right?  No, back in the day when she was homeless. 
[04:16:00]  Right, and sold her mouth.  She might have sold her mouth indirectly.  That was her business when she was on a train track.  But because she had no...  Well, it's better than being on a door in an abandoned building.  She was blowing ponytail behind the liquor store.  Gallery.  Gallery Lickers.  What's worse?  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  What's worse?  Yeah.  Blowing a hobo dick on the train tracks or laying on an abandoned door in a building and getting railed? 
[04:16:30]  That's fucking crazy.  Which one do you think?  Or spending the 80s in the backseat of a car.  In the back of a car getting ass-fucked every weekend.  Fucking horrified that you're getting a dick in the ass every weekend.  Do something.  Every weekend.  Does that mean every Saturday and Sunday?  Oh, it was a couple times it was.  Yeah.  They're still babbling.  Go ahead.  Finish up, ladies.  I was going to go walk.  Diana, what the hell are you doing over there?  You haven't been over there in ages.  And tell Bill to shut the fuck up.  Yeah. 
[04:17:00]  Bill.  Yeah, but let me tell you something.  Why does he got to call me up and complain to me when I'm trying to get a hold of the hospital?  My mother's in the hospital.  I don't give a shit.  How much listen you took?  You want to get blowin' it and pop?  That's your business.  Want to get?  Don't be going over to Elmore Avenue looking for people to buy you drinks at the Lamplight.  Elmore Avenue?  Elway Avenue?  Elway Avenue?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Todd has nothing on us.  This is a lot of local references.  I had my own money.  I don't have to say what you did.  You went over there to see if those guys that hang out there would buy you a drink. 
[04:17:30]  Oh, shit.  That's what Bill told you to do.  For a little favor.  Come on.  Diana, don't lie.  Oh.  I'm sorry to you.  You never go out.  So you must have got a hold of Ronnie somehow.  I said, Ronnie, I'll meet you at the time.  Is that Ronnie Ponytail?  Ronnie came over to the Lamplight.  The Lamplight?  That's the last time he went to the Lamplight.  What do you think Ponytail's poison is?  He's doing shots.  He's a shot guy.  Can you imagine Di flirting, trying to get somebody to buy her a drink? 
[04:18:00]  Batting her eyes behind her crooked, broken glasses.  Oh, sure.  Are you from the area?  Yeah.  I'm here often, fella.  Like ugly lassie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The makeup.  Yeah.  Oh, Marion, hang it up.  Lady Di.  You just lost your best friend, Lady Di.  Lady Di, listen.  Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di.  Listen to me and answer this question, okay? 
[04:18:30]  You're crazy.  All right.  Did you take out more money?  Ponytail.  Did you take out more money from the ATM than Bill told you?  Yes, I did.  All right.  All right.  Now, why did you do this?  I did it to have a few drinks over at the Lamplight.  How much more did you take out than he said to take out?  $60.  $60 more?  What a fucking piece of shit. 
[04:19:00]  Are you buying crack?  No.  A lot of people are saying, hold on.  Hold on.  Bob's going to get involved here.  Bob in Illinois.  He knows a thing or two about a thing or two.  Bob, go ahead.  This track can't be Avery.  When's the last time you smoked crack, Lady Di?  Tell us when the last time was.  The last time I smoked crack was...  Liar.  Right now, about three.  No.  I'm not lying.  Liar.  Let me finish.  Hold on.  I want to hear what she says.  When?  Three years ago.  How many? 
[04:19:30]  Three years ago.  Holy shit.  She smokes crack.  It all makes sense now.  She smokes crack.  Bob, you're a fucking genius.  Now.  Because there's no way she smoked crack three years ago and then just stopped.  And stopped.  There's no fucking way without any help.  She's still smoking crack.  And that's why you got robbed outside the chicken place.  You were trying to cop some crack.  Oh, Bob, you're a genius.  You were trying to cop crack.  That's why she got so sick when she was here because she needed crack.  Because that's why she stole 60 bucks from fucking Bill. 
[04:20:00]  Right.  For crack.  Oh, because that whole, you know, getting ripped off was way too suspicious.  Fishing.  It was a little too fishy and shady because we know she doesn't like eating in general.  So why would she all of a sudden be at a chicken place?  Excuse me.  I love eating when I'm hungry.  You probably went there for Bill, but then you're like, well, I could use his money for  some crack.  So I'm going to get my crack, do my thing.  And then now I need an excuse for Bill.  So I'll just tell him I got robbed.  I got mugged. 
[04:20:30]  No.  Or she got robbed by a crack dealer.  Lady Di, there's no way you were smoking crack three years ago and you just stopped cold  turkey.  There's no way.  Yeah.  There is a way.  So you were smoking crack three years ago.  When was the last time you smoked crack, Di?  Sam, Sam, listen to me.  Yeah.  The only time that you're addicted is when you're actually doing it.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  You see how easy this was for Bob to get this out of her? 
[04:21:00]  Bob, I love you today, brother.  You're the best.  Where's my prize?  Where's my prize?  I got some.  What size are you?  I just happened to bring in a couple of check out the empty Zip Mom t-shirts.  Well, large or extra large?  I got a large.  I think I got a large left.  Sam will give away the rest of the shirts on the post show today.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  Lucky you, Sam.  Oh, boy.  She's a crackhead.  Bob, hold on.  We're going to send you a shirt and some other shit, for real.  That's how you call me a crackhead.  You're a crackhead.  But when was the last time you did it three years ago, but then did you do it in the last 
[04:21:30]  month?  And you can't say that you're only addicted when you're doing it.  That's the dumbest thing anybody could say that's an addict.  So when was the last time you were addicted?  Yeah.  Three years ago.  I don't believe that.  Uh-uh.  Well, you better, bud.  I haven't...  Where did you get...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.  Where did you get your crack three years ago?  This girl named...  Should I mention a bit? 
[04:22:00]  No, don't mention her name.  Don't mention her name.  No one cares.  But where was it?  Like, how did you know her, and where was it?  Yeah.  Geographically, yes.  I've known her for a long time.  I've known her for, like, maybe about maybe seven years or so.  Geographically.  Where does she hang out?  She was in Elizabeth.  She still lives in Elizabeth.  Elizabeth?  Isn't that where the fuck in?  Did she give you the crack outside a chicken place?  No.  No.  Yes?  No.  No, she was nowhere near that chicken place. 
[04:22:30]  So you probably were smoking crack last night.  Yep.  You weren't closing down a bar.  You were like...  I was smoking crack last night.  You get free drinks from guys because you go in there and paw all over them like you're  going to blow them.  So you don't need money for drinks, and so you get the money to buy crack.  Anthony, listen to me.  I went there for a few drinks, and I met Ronnie over there.  Ronnie's been my friend.  Ronnie Ponytail?  Ronnie Ponytail do crack?  Tell me it owes me money.  Ronnie Ponytail, that one.  Yeah.  Does he do crack?  No.  I don't know.  Oh. 
[04:23:00]  It's like a movie.  You know that...  Yes.  I have no idea.  All I know is I drink.  You know that...  Well, I can't say that Ronnie Ponytail does crack because I never met Ronnie Ponytail.  I don't know.  I feel like I know Ronnie Ponytail.  But she doesn't know either.  Right.  Would you like to meet him one day?  No.  Dream come true. 
[04:23:30]  Well, anyway, anyway, Sandy and I want to know, and...  Colfax.  All right.  All right.  Bob, we're going to put you on hold.  We'll get your address for some shit.  Thank you, Bob in Illinois.  All right, Lady Di, we got to go because I don't...  Because I don't care.  And you're lying to us.  You're a liar.  I believe you smoke crack still.  Yep.  No, I don't.  I did not.  No.  I believe...  We're allowed to say I believe.  I believe you smoke crack still.  I don't know for sure.  Wait.  Hold on a second. 
[04:24:00]  Let me talk to Bill for one...  I know...  I know that pains everybody, what I just said.  I get it.  Yeah.  I get it.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  But he loves dishing the honesty, this Bill.  He does.  He's on the other phone.  Hold on a second, okay?  What?  He's got two phones.  It's crazy.  No one has two phones.  Can you hold on?  Can we hold on?  Yeah.  Can you...  What do you think?  It's a fucking radio show.  Yep.  Before he's...  Oh, no.  He's on the phone for a minute.  With who? 
[04:24:30]  I don't know.  Crack dealer?  His bank.  Yeah, he's fucking...  He's shut...  He's changing all the info, right?  Right.  He's changing passwords.  His fucking bank.  Fucking...  You thief.  You're a fucking thief.  You stole money from...  Jimmy.  You stole money from the guy that fucking hooked you up with a place to live.  Right.  You stole 60 bucks, and God only knows how much you've stolen before from the ATM.  Eh, well.  Eh, well.  A lot.  You look at him. 
[04:25:00]  Bill.  And...  I might say, you pick...  He's on the phone with something very important.  What's important in Bill's life?  He's on the phone with the vet.  No, Jimmy.  No.  No, no, no, no.  Believe me, I haven't done crack in a long time.  Eh, three years, or three months, or three days, or three hours.  I would go with three hours.  Yeah.  I'm going three hours.  Oh, great.  What about you guys?  You never did that before.  Why is Bobo at your house?  What? 
[04:25:30]  Bobo, why are you at Lady Di's house?  Oh, no, I'm not.  I'm at home.  Hi, Bobo.  Happy birthday, baby.  Hey, Lady Di.  Why don't you keep saying happy birthday to everybody?  Because his birthday's coming up.  He said happy birthday to four to four to five.  It is Bobo.  Bobo, why are you calling?  You say no.  You got...  Because he's...  We're friends.  That's why he's calling.  Bobo, when's your birthday?  Tomorrow? 
[04:26:00]  No, it's on the 30th.  It's on Wednesday.  Wednesday?  So Bobo's birthday's close to your birthday.  Oh, happy birthday, Bobo.  Bobo, have you ever smoked crack with Lady Di?  Because we're trying to figure out who has smoked crack with Lady Di.  I don't smoke crack!  I don't even do crack.  I don't even do crack.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now Bill wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  No, we wanted to talk to him.  Bobo lost his phone.  His cell phone.  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  Will you just get Bill on the phone so we can end this crap?  All right.  All right.  Hold on. 
[04:26:30]  Hold on.  Here's Bill.  O.P. and Anthony.  Peace out.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I got a simple question for you, Bill.  When was the last time Lady Di smoked crack?  Never with me.  Nine years.  She just told us three, Bill.  Well, you know, all right.  Okay, fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's over at a peachy shit's house.  Lisa.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  And. 
[04:27:00]  Don't mention, okay?  I don't give a shit.  The hell are you?  I love it.  So she's over there?  Just don't mention her last name, but she has this friend Lisa that she smokes crack with.  Well, yeah.  You just take care of her, too.  Uh-huh.  Wow, Bill.  I threw her out because she gave me a stroke.  I was in the hospital for a week.  Jesus.  She gave you a stroke?  How did she give you a stroke?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What had you asked for? 
[04:27:30]  She didn't stroke the right thing.  Oh, she didn't stroke the right thing.  Gotcha.  Hey, Bill, so Lady Di took 60 bucks out of your bank account last night?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  I have no idea.  $60 more, I think.  Because you might be smoking crack still there.  We think it's for crack.  What was that avenue she was on last night that we learned from Marion?  Uh, Elmore Avenue.  Elmore.  What goes on on that avenue, sir?  A bunch of lone wives. 
[04:28:00]  Yeah.  So why would she be there unless she was looking for something a little stronger?  Well, you've got to forget she was on the street.  Yeah.  And she knows all these lone wives.  And there's no idea she ran out of beer.  I told her, you're taking my credit card.  Of Elmore?  Good call.  Yeah, let's get a street view of Elmore Avenue and see what...  We're putting the pieces together for you, Bill.  See what it looks like.  It looks like a drug-dealing area.  Because we think she's doing crack again, and she's stealing your money to buy crack. 
[04:28:30]  No, she's stealing my money by extra beer.  I think she gets the beer from going into bars and touching guys' wee-wees.  Yeah, I think she needs a little more than beer.  Yeah.  Bill, Anglewood?  You don't believe she got...  I would.  You don't believe she got mugged outside that chicken place, do you?  Yep.  You do believe it?  Yep, because...  No, Elmore?  Elmore Avenue.  East Meadow or Anglewood? 
[04:29:00]  No, no, no.  That was on Bayway Avenue.  All right, all right.  Too many local references.  What's the one avenue we're trying to find, Bill?  Elmore Avenue.  Is it called Elmore Avenue?  Yeah, that was the last night.  Where is it at?  What city?  Yeah.  Yeah, right, Bill, I'm about five blocks, six blocks away from where I live.  I don't know where you live.  We're trying to find it on a map.  What's the town?  I don't know where it is.  What town?  She had no business.  Oh, my God.  What's the town it's in? 
[04:29:30]  Elizabeth.  All right, Elizabeth.  Which is next to what?  All right, we might have found it.  Maybe Elmore.  Elmore Avenue.  Yeah, that's it.  Elmore Avenue.  Elmore Avenue.  I heard that.  All right.  All right, we're going to street view this shit.  Elmore Avenue, and we're going to look at the street view and see what it looks like.  All right.  Oh, it's a nice nose.  It's a nice ear.  It's all Jewish.  Oh, yeah?  So why are the lowlifes there?  Yeah, what are the lowlifes doing there, then?  Because they hang out and they drink their beer. 
[04:30:00]  Discount Depot?  You said this was a nice area?  The first store we came upon is the Discount Depot.  Donuts.  All right.  Where's the liquor store?  Where's Gallery Liquors with fucking Ponytail?  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  You know Ponytail?  Is Ponytail a cool guy?  I don't like both of them.  I think they're gay.  Oh, shit. 
[04:30:30]  Who, Ponytail?  Yeah.  You think so, huh, Bill?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you fucking great.  I'm a good judge of characters.  I doubt that.  Give him a second.  You do know what's living in your house, right?  A crackhead.  No, there ain't no character.  A manipulator.  A thief.  A liar.  No, no, no.  What is that?  That's the liquor gallery.  That's a shitty gallery. 
[04:31:00]  I thought it was going to be a big place.  No.  What's going on with those guys right outside the liquor gallery on the Street View?  Oh, man.  That don't look good.  No.  Well, what they do, they sit in the back and drink beer and Coke, Coke, 45, Moe.  We're not allowed to do that anymore.  She said, we are not allowed to do that anymore.  We are not allowed to do that anymore, Bill.  She used to hang out out there and drink with the boys.  Yeah. 
[04:31:30]  Yeah, we used to.  But we're not allowed to do that anymore.  Yeah, she's proud of this shit.  Oh, I love Bill.  It is a nice area.  You can tell.  Bill's turned me big time.  Cash for gold right across the street.  Right across the street from the liquor gallery.  All right.  And not much of a gallery, by the way.  More homeboys right there.  Well, this is...  Oh, we're going around the corner now.  What's that?  Oh, the cardboard.  What's the cardboard?  The good old-fashioned bodega.  Ah, there you go.  You can get lottery tickets.  That's called the cardboard.  Yes, I did.  I heard you. 
[04:32:00]  All right.  What's the next one around that other corner?  Oh, look at this guy.  Oh, boy.  What's he doing?  This looks like a terrible neighborhood.  It's the guy with the cash for gold sign.  No.  No, I live in a good neighborhood.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  I'm really good.  Well, make sure she doesn't start doing crack in your house there.  Oh, no.  You're going to start noticing shit disappearing, my friend.  You can't live with a crackhead.  And she said she quit cold turkey three years ago.  She can't even quit fucking drinking beer in the morning. 
[04:32:30]  No, that was because I threw Lisa out, and she got her a place.  I want you to don't mention any names.  Watch that slum bag.  It's probably the safest name you can mention, by the way.  No, anyway.  Bill.  Hold on.  Bill, Bill, Bill.  Ask Lady Di the last time she smoked crack, because you think it's nine years.  Go ahead. 
[04:33:00]  Ask her right now.  Actually, it was three years ago, like you said.  Okay.  She was over at Lisa's house.  Lisa's mess around, you name it.  Right.  She went back to drugs.  When she lived here, she was clean.  Right.  Okay, hold on a second.  Marion wants in again.  Marion, go ahead.  We've got Bill on the line.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Listen, I'm telling you one thing.  Change your ATM, Finn.  Change everything.  Because when you called me last time, I told you about Diana. 
[04:33:30]  Diana admitted to Opie and Anthony that she did take money to go drinking.  Sixty bucks.  She don't need to be at the lamplight.  There's the corner bar.  There's Carl she can go to.  She don't need to be going down that.  Yeah, but she can't get crack at the other bars, right?  There's been on Mora Avenue in months.  Not about a year.  There's on Mora Avenue.  Sounds like a good time.  Yes, ma'am, you're right.  You know what?  Opie and Anthony, Bill told me that there was beer in the refrigerator for Diana. 
[04:34:00]  Oh.  That means she's going out for something else.  Right.  She needed crack.  She needs something heavier.  Anthony, Opie, Diane, don't do drugs.  How do you know?  She don't do drugs.  How do you know?  Because I know she don't.  She used to do crack.  You know that?  She has no money to get drugs.  That's why she's stealing from Bill.  And crack is relatively cheap.  I can tell you.  She's more of a beer drinker.  She's more of a drinker.  Well, how come there was beer in the fridge and she didn't want that, so she stole 60 bucks  from Bill and went out? 
[04:34:30]  Why wasn't she...  Because she wanted more.  No, she wanted crack.  No, you silly goose.  She wanted the crack.  She told us she was smoking crack three years ago.  Like she said, she wanted to go see her farm.  Marion, do you realize she was smoking crack three years ago?  Yes, I don't know that.  Okay.  Well, she still...  And she said you're not addicted unless you're doing it.  Which is great logic.  And a great t-shirt.  Let's be honest with you.  Yeah, that's true.  Bill is having a good giggle at that line.  He is chuckling.  I don't know the person that she was doing it with.  I know Lisa.  I know Lisa.  How?  Don't mention names. 
[04:35:00]  Well, you guys did.  She did.  Yeah, we don't care.  I don't even know her last name anyway, but it's true, though.  But she doesn't do drugs.  Diane's more of a drinker.  More of a drinker.  Well, you know what?  What is she...  She must have been afraid that if she fell asleep when she got up to buy a beer left.  She didn't need to go all the way up.  You guys are just silly gooses.  Yep.  You're in denial.  You're in denial if you think she's leaving the house on a Sunday night to go drink when  there's beer in the house. 
[04:35:30]  I want to hang out with somebody.  Oh, you guys are just silly.  She probably, myself, she probably wanted to go, you know, and hang out with her old  friends.  Man, why would you want to do that?  Honestly, Bill don't like her hanging out with those old friends.  Right.  All right.  Bill told me he's going to throw her out again.  Yeah, look at the time.  Yeah, we got to go.  All right.  We care right up until 1030.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right, Marion.  Thank you.  Bill, thank you so much, sir. 
[04:36:00]  Hey, guys, you know, I like you guys.  You're pretty cool.  You're pretty cool, too, Bill.  We like you, Bill.  No, we're not.  And neither are you.  We like Bill.  Oh, my God.  He's fine.  Excuse me, guys.  He's fine.  Please.  I know you're a bunch of jerks on the air.  You have to.  Right.  But down the earth, I bet you're a bunch of good guys.  Well, look at that.  He can tell.  Yeah, shut up.  He can sense it.  Thank you, Bill.  He can sense how cool and good guys we are. 
[04:36:30]  I'm going to have a little skip in my step today because you said that, sir.  And tomorrow when we come out, I'll tell the story of the guy who pulled his dick out  on the late show.  Oh, God.  You want to tell him now?  No, just me.  What did he say?  I can't stay late, though, today.  I'm back again.  All right.  You're gone.  I got to get.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I totally forgot we were going to tell that story today.  I know.  I feel like an idiot now.  With the Lady Di's magic, it's, you know, you forget.  Right. 
[04:37:00]  When that kind of entertainment is pouring out of your fucking speakers.  Well, we learned a little more.  We did.  She was smoking crack three years ago, which means she's probably still doing it.  I would assume so.  She has zero.  Without rehab, I don't know how you just continue drinking your face off and not do crack.  She's got zero willpower, too.  She can do anything.  Someone explain how that is possible.  It's not.  And now that she's not hanging with the Lisa broad, she has to go and do some, you know,  go to some shady areas to possibly get it.  Maybe talk to Ponytail.  Maybe.  Steals 60 bucks.  I don't know what Ponytail's up to.  She had beer. 
[04:37:30]  Right.  I'm not fucking buying that.  And we didn't get to the horse story, Sam.  No, we did not.  We started, and then Lady Di said something about a horse.  And what happened to Bobo?  Oh, God.  Still on the line, by the way.  It's me.  Have fun with that.  It's Bobo.  Donald 22 in Missed Connections on Craigslist.  His post was, I am 22 years old, and I want to play with a male horse.  Simple as that.  If you have access to a male horse and can allow me to access, can allow me access to  a male horse, then contact me, please. 
[04:38:00]  I will do something in return.  Oh.  Police saw that and tracked him down and arrested him.  He's also dressed as a woman in the ad.  What is the, what's the problem, though, with soliciting a horse?  Is there a law against that?  They arrested him for what?  What's the charge?  Police were able to track him down after another Craigslist guy contacted officers I had  discussed.  The detective reports the Phoenix News Time actually met this guy with a horse. 
[04:38:30]  Oh.  Oh, so the paper comes by with a horse saying, all right, hey.  With a horse.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  And he's dressed like a girl in his Craigslist full, uh, full sexy.  He wants to fuck a horse or be fucked by one?  He wants to play.  He wants to play with a male, male horse.  Male horse.  He wants to be fucked.  Oh, that's so weird.  As dirty as, I just can't wrap my head around that.  You can't get a big enough dick is what it is.  I don't know what it means. 
[04:39:00]  You just need a giant horse cock.  It's like an ear-crossing species.  That's crazy.  It's so weird.  Wow.  The biggest man cock is not big enough for this guy.  That's exactly right.  Please isolate that.  Like this guy.  Oh, my God.  That was a bad one to say.  I want to know about Caroline's gym.  That's funny.  I'll tell it tomorrow.  It's late. 
[04:39:30]  I got to go to the gym.  I feel bad.  That's right.  I got to get.  We got involved with that.  Maybe a little too long.  Yeah.  All right, y'all.  All right.  That's it.  We're not promoting anything, right?  We're all good.  No.  End the show.  All right.  Oh, we're not.  The Opie and Anthony show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts' Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments.

But you know what?  Stacey Heach is not normally wrong, but he was wrong today.  It's not just.  I mean, he wasn't wrong, but he was a little incomplete.  It's not just the Post Show with Sam Roberts.  Returning.  Nicole from the morning mashup.  Nicole's back.  She's a mother.  I am.  She's back at work. 
[04:49:00]  How long were you gone for?  Six weeks.  All the morning mashup listeners were saying it seemed like a shitload longer than six weeks.  It was a long time of sausage festivity.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, they were just.  Were they happy to have you back?  Of course they were.  And I was happy to be back.  Were you, though?  Yeah, I mean, I was sad a little bit to leave the baby.  But I mean, I mean, I love my job.  I was thinking after you go home and you have a baby, you realize what bullshit the whole  morning mashup thing is.  Oh, no.  I'm surprised you even bothered to come back.  Like, really?  Like, I have this child in my life now. 
[04:49:30]  Do you really need me there to play the hits every morning?  Yes, they do.  All right.  I don't know.  They need me.  I don't know.  God.  Were the listeners happy to have you back or did they notice?  They noticed?  Of course they noticed.  Do you think if you took the morning mashup off the air and just put, like, a rotation  of hit music on, how many weeks do you think it would be before the listeners would go,  My first day back is such a dick.  Didn't we used to have a show on this?  Wasn't there, like, people talking?  Oh, whatever.  I guess they're going to come on.  We must have missed them this morning.  Don't you need to talk about what happened on Opie and Anthony today? 
[04:50:00]  Yes, of course I need to talk about what happened on Opie and Anthony.  We got some big news that I'm glad that you're here to be a part of.  Dan in Pennsylvania?  Oh, yeah.  Not weird news.  Lady Di's a crackhead.  Lady Di, we found out, smoked some crack.  But you had to have known that before.  Well, we didn't have it confirmed.  You assumed.  I mean, one could assume.  Did you assume?  I mean, I assumed something was not right.  There was some sort of drug use.  Now that you have a person in this world that you created, do you look at Lady Di and go, 
[04:50:30]  how do I stop?  It's so funny that you're saying that.  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  Hey, Lady Di.  I am not a crackhead.  Oh.  Okay.  That's so mean, Sam.  I didn't know she was on the phone.  Yeah, she was on the phone.  Di.  Nicole, congratulations on your baby.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Oh, isn't that nice?  All right.  Would you have a boy or a girl?  I had a little girl.  But more importantly, are you smoking crack, Lady Di?  No, I'm not smoking crack. 
[04:51:00]  I don't do that.  It's been three years.  Okay, so you used to smoke crack.  She said.  She's lying, though.  I don't like that.  Sam, don't be a wise guy.  You're right.  I was a bit of a Weisenheimer there.  You know what she said?  You are.  You are a Weisenheimer.  She said you're not addicted unless you're using.  Okay.  So.  Makes sense.  Right.  Right.  I get that.  So do you worry, though, about your kid becoming Lady Di or something like that?  Not becoming her, but I look around on the subway or the streets, and I'm just  like, how do I not let her become those people or be near them? 
[04:51:30]  Right.  Like, I've seen.  Now you've seen the way humanity begins.  Yeah.  Like, how does humanity evolve into this?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  What say you, Lady Di?  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Sometimes people experiment.  And don't I know it, Lady Di?  You're not here to judge.  Aries, especially people that were born in April.  Oh.  Especially them.  Uh-oh.  March or April?  March.  My baby's born in March.  End of March, though. 
[04:52:00]  March 14th.  That's pretty close to April.  I'm shushed.  That's like two, two and a half weeks from April.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I was born April 1st.  Ah.  Now.  That is my birthday.  Di, it doesn't matter what month or day you were born at all.  The fact is that you smoked crack, and we probably think are lying about the fact that  it's been three years.  No, no, no.  It's been a few years, yeah.  I have a question.  I have a question.  A few.  This might sound wrong coming from a new mother, but was it fun? 
[04:52:30]  No, not really.  Well, how many times did you do it?  I went through a lot of money with that.  Okay.  It was my money anyway, and it was my dad's money that he gave me.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is a whole new development.  Because if you remember, the first time Lady Di came back to the channel, you hold  on a second.  You hold on a second.  Because the first time that you introduced yourself back, you called in the after show,  which is now the post show, and you said that you had gotten money from your dad who had 
[04:53:00]  died, but that you didn't have all of it.  Are you telling me now that your dad died and you spent the inheritance on crack cocaine?  No, I did not.  Di?  No, I would not.  Di?  No, no, no, no.  When did your dad die?  How many years ago did your dad die?  He died in 2000...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  I forget.  2012.  I think she's lying.  She's lying.  2012 or 2012.  Yeah, no. 
[04:53:30]  No, no, 2012.  You know...  So your dad alive...  When your dad was alive, he handed you money, and you went and bought crack with it.  He used to when I...  No, no.  And at that point, you must have been, what, 55 years old?  I'm 52 years old right now.  I just hope when I give Parker money, she doesn't go buy crack cocaine.  That's all I can hope.  Right.  Baby Nicole.  I thought we were going to go with Samantha for the name.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Now, you know...  What's these beeps in the background I keep on hearing right now? 
[04:54:00]  That's the side effects of the crack cocaine.  That would be crack cocaine, yeah.  That's very funny.  Well, Di, it was great catching up with you today.  I'm hoping that we catch up with you soon in the future.  Hey, Sam, I love you.  Oh, thank you very much, Di.  You couldn't know how strongly I feel about you.  If I wasn't married, Di, it would be me and you.  Bareback.  I know.  You know that, don't you?  She knows.  There would be no protection or artificial lubricant. 
[04:54:30]  Wait, hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Yes.  Okay.  Now, what I'm trying to say is I haven't done crack in a long time.  Good.  At least six months.  No, not six months.  I haven't done it.  What do you think, Bobo?  I told you over a year ago.  Steven, I picked up Bobo.  He's still on hold.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Bobo.  First of all, I get waking up to this oldest lady died, your aunt. 
[04:55:00]  Nicole.  Oh, sorry, Bobo.  It was great.  Yeah.  It was great to see you today.  It was great to see you.  I'm glad you're back.  Short and sweet.  Now, did, yeah, well, that's the way the post show is.  I know.  Well, I would at least say short.  Okay.  I don't know if we even have time to do anything that would be considered sweet.  But, was Dennis disappointed at all that he was proven wrong and that your baby was  born healthy?  I don't think he was disappointed.  Okay.  I think he was disappointed I didn't choose him as my nanny, but, um, you know.  You don't want to do that?  No.  Not at all.  Um, you must be excited. 
[04:55:30]  Excited about what?  Mother's Day is coming.  Oh!  Woo!  Yes, indeed.  Give it to me, Sam.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  Not you.  You're the mother now.  I'm talking to the audience.  Mother's Day is on its way.  You can't get your mom or your wife, the mother, your baby mama.

No, it's your grace period.  Yeah, you haven't done anything motherly yet.  I squeezed her out of my loins.  That's not...  But that's not...  Well...  I don't...  You got a push present for that, right?  I got a couple for that.  So, all right, so you're squaring that.  No.  So, are we square?  No.  All right, Nicole.  I could talk to you for hours, but you know that.  No, I know.  And as a matter of fact, I think maybe I'll walk down the hallway and we will talk to each
