<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the Conficker computer virus, initially dismissed by the hosts as an April Fool's Day prank, contrasting their skepticism with the media's alarmist reporting. One host jokingly claimed to have the virus, which he said had inexplicably ordered him tennis socks.  This transitioned into a satirical takedown of a body-shaper infomercial, focusing on its deceptive editing and before-and-after shots.

The show then shifted to a rant about excessive surcharges and taxes, citing rising taxi fares in New York City and cigarette taxes as examples.  Opie and Anthony expressed their anger at the lack of transparency regarding the allocation of these funds and the perceived mismanagement, using the MTA as a prime example of this inefficiency.  They also touched upon the recent firings at NBC, speculating on the reasons and drawing parallels to their own career experiences with radio station changes.  Marvin Gaye's death anniversary was briefly mentioned, followed by a discussion of their upcoming move to a smaller studio and listener reactions on social media.  The hosts then concluded this section with a broader commentary on American democracy and freedom, comparing past freedoms with what they perceived as contemporary restrictions, referencing a news story about a reporter, Mike Sheehan, who allegedly hit a police horse while drunk and subsequently denied the incident.

The broadcast continued with a comparison of societal changes, contrasting a simpler past with horse-drawn carriages and uneven train tracks to the heavily regulated present, characterized by a focus on avoiding trouble. This led into a scathing critique of the American political system, filled with strong profanity,  where the hosts argued that politicians prioritize corporate interests and self-preservation over the needs of the people. They lamented the absence of direct representation and the overall ineffectiveness of the current system.  Their frustration with high taxes and surcharges continued, using the analogy of a frog slowly being boiled alive to describe the gradual erosion of the public's awareness of economic realities. The hosts even suggested that a foreign invasion or a multi-party system might be necessary to jolt the political system out of its stagnation.  The segment included brief, humorous interludes involving a listener's false April Fool's Day prank about a radio station format change and another concerning the lack of news coverage of Bloomberg.  No guests appeared in studio during the broadcast.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio. 
[00:04:30]  Ah, good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony shoot.  Hi, peoples.  Turn off your computer.  Turn off your computer. 
[00:05:00]  Does that help, though?  Now they're saying that doesn't even help.  No, that won't help.  If your computer's infected with the, what's the name of it?  This is not our April Fool's prank, by the way.  The AIDS virus for computers?  Yeah, we're not doing an April Fool's prank this year.  Yeah, we're not doing an April Fool's prank this year.  Or are we?  I think this is some kind of a gag.  Really?  Because the mainstream media is saying it's no gag, Anthony.  We have to take this very seriously.  The Conficker, computer virus.  Conficker.  Basically saying it would, you know, go into your banking and everything. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, they say there could be keystroke recorders on there.  And, you know, this virus is going to start taking over programs, do whatever it wants.  Yeah.  Start buying other software for your computer that you don't need.  You're going to buy things and stop it.  You don't think it's happening?  Nah, this is one of those April Fool's gags, a la Y2K kind of, you know, oh my God, it's  going to be terrible.  And the news just loves this. 
[00:06:00]  They jump all over it?  They love it.  I read yesterday that a tech guy was saying that, no, this is absolutely just a fake.  And then the news, though, they won't carry that.  They'll be like, oh, well, will it?  Will it?  Can it?  Would it?  Because they just want you tuning in.  Yeah.  So we're saying it's a phony.  So then when everyone has their identity stolen, they can blame us?  Yeah, they can blame us for just going, ah, just business as usual.  Don't worry about it.  We're going to go the other way with this one. 
[00:06:30]  It's fake.  Yeah, it's fake.  That's what I'm saying.  Let's take a chance on this one.  Alert the media.  Opie and Anthony say the Conficker computer virus is fake.  It's an April Fool's prank.  In this studio, ours will be the first computers to go.  They're all infected with something.  I don't know shit.  If they don't have the Conficker, I don't know what does.  So our computers are the first line of defense.  Yeah.  Once ours go down, then we can just, you know.  Start screaming.  Scream.  Ah, look out.  Turn it off.  But aren't these microphones all computerized and you can't just turn on a microphone anymore. 
[00:07:00]  When I started radio, you could just turn a microphone on and go, now you got to like  set stuff on a computer.  Yeah, the computers will go out and your mics won't work anymore.  I don't know.  I guess the easiest thing to do if you're infected is to unplug your computer from the internet.  Yeah.  Because then it can't do anything.  Yeah, that's true.  You ever had to just pull the goddamn plug?  See?  The worm expected to hit millions of computers today. 
[00:07:30]  When?  What time?  The Conficker's not an April Fool's joke.  It's supposedly not.  I have it.  What?  I have it.  You have the Conficker?  I do.  It does weird stuff.  In your tummy?  No.  No, no.  It ordered me a box of tennis socks.  I don't need tennis socks.  No.  Tennis socks can be fun, though.  It would be handy if it just ordered a hooker.  I'm like, Conficker!  It's a new show on Fox.  Conficker! 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, I just think it's bullshit.  It's a gag.  It's probably out there, but not like any other virus, but I don't think it's going to  be this widespread, oh my God.  The internet's going to slow down and be gone today thing.  I've been watching the same commercial for the new body shaper.  Oh, it looks great.  I need this thing.  Look at that.  Look at the double ass on this girl.  And now there's no double ass.  But it's still huge.  Only $39.95.  You know the sweat that must build up under that thing? 
[00:08:30]  In the double ass area?  Yeah, it looks like boxer briefs for bitches, and it's supposed to hold their ass in.  And their tummy.  So, you know, it's not fat.  It's one of these commercials where about five minutes in, you go, wait a minute.  This isn't a commercial.  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  I saw this part already.  And then I like when they're... 
[00:09:00]  Look at this chick.  They're finding really hot chicks that might have just a slight problem.  A little belly on her, maybe.  So when they put the body shaper on, you're like, all right.  Look at her tits.  Look at her tits poking out of the top of it.  Get out of here.  She's not the one wearing it.  Yeah.  That big fat slob we saw on Maury or whatever.  Oh, that little...  On Tyra.  Yeah.  All right.  I like the infomercials that are like TV shows.  They try to make them like TV shows.  That's what I mean.  And they'll be like, and we'll be back right after this message. 
[00:09:30]  And it's a commercial for what they're selling.  Yeah.  Why is that?  I don't get it.  And then you're finally hooked.  A lot of rain in the area for New York City, huh?  Yeah.  Next three or four days.  It was so beautiful yesterday.  Yes, it was.  Sable to sit out in the yard for a little while.  Mm-hmm.  Very nice.  Sounds fun.  It was.  And now...  Jeez, why are you yelling?  It was.  I always yell at Jimmy's nice little comments.  Jimmy makes nice little comments, and I yell at him. 
[00:10:00]  See you wearing a hat.  I am.  Yes.  Yes.  I am.  Marvin Gaye was shot 25 years ago today.  What the hell was that about?  Wow.  That is crazy.  That's a problem with his dad, I think.  His father was a bit crazy.  Yeah, a little crazy.  But that 25 years?  Yeah.  Christ.  I know.  He was a young guy, too.  Kind of went by.  What were you saying?  He was like 44?  He was 44, so think about what he would have been now if he would have...  Pushing 70?  Pushing 70.  He would have been helping the American Idol contestants. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They'd all be singing Marvin Gaye songs around the piano.  You know, meeting Marvin Gaye, to me, was one of the highlights of my life.  Blah, blah, blah.  Got it.  I love when they bring on a known gay artist, and you just see him eyeballing the young boys.  Yeah, the young meat.  He spent so much time with me.  Very meticulous.  More time...  Like, the girls were going in, and they were ushering them right out.  But me, I was in there for three hours with Elton. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I don't watch that American Idol anymore.  No, I don't know anyone that does.  Apparently, it's still doing very well in the ratings, but...  I mean, I completely lost interest last season.  And then this season, I didn't even...  Last season, I tuned into, like, the first couple of episodes.  This season, have not watched a minute of it.  What's that about?  And don't miss it at all.  You think we finally got too old for American Idol?  No, it just got, like...  Because it's still doing more in the ratings. 
[00:11:30]  We usually try to, like, keep on top of that stuff.  It got boring.  You know what it was?  I think, yeah, a lot of...  Same old, same old.  A lot of youngins.  The young girls and young boys.  You know, they might still watch it.  But I think a lot of the older demo kind of just said,  meh, I'm bored with it.  I can't be bathed.  I see we're putting out some fine stuff from the office today.  There it is, a new batch.  Oh, my God.  Is that some type of Jeff Norris? 
[00:12:00]  Didn't we give Jeff Norris stuff away yesterday?  There's plenty more of that.  Plenty of Jeff Norris stuff to give away.  That's old school.  Wow.  The white gorilla.  All right, E-Rock.  E-Rock's loading up the couch today.  We're going to...  Wow hats.  Kevin Smith.  Boy, there's a lot of stuff over there.  A Detroit Tigers jersey.  Oh.  Whose name is on that?  A Wilf.  Oh, I see my signature on there.  Good.  I want to have to sign it for whoever gets it.  A Wilf.  Annoying motherfuckers out in front of the building.  Just hanging out.  Well, that goes away in a few days, so enjoy it. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  The Will Farrell, what, platinum record from Semi Pro?  That's got to be fake.  What else you got over there, Sam?  Anything fun?  With some laminants.  Yeah, all access passes.  Oh, why would it work?  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  All access passes from Dice shows and from Days of the New and Octane.  Oh.  Sponsored by WYSP.  Oh, wow.  That goes way back.  Wow, those are classic items.  That was from our road show where Days of the New. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Actually, it was just Travis Meeks.  Yeah, he came in.  We were in Philadelphia.  He came in and played.  He decided that he needed about a half hour, 40 minutes after we left the stage, and that  pretty much gave everybody time to completely leave the venue.  To leave.  Right.  Like, he misread that one big time.  He was letting his whole staff light candles on the stage and get him in the mood.  Oh, yeah.  And people just filing out.  Leaving.  And no one had the common sense to tell Travis, you better get out there immediately or you're 
[00:13:30]  going to be performing to nobody.  And that's what he did.  Which is, yeah, exactly what happened.  The crowd was still booing him when we got up on stage.  He's a good artist, but there was a miscalculation going on that day.  What kind of music did he sing?  Do you remember he played in studio?  He's, you know, a little rock and roll.  He could do a fine Jim Morrison impression.  He really can.  They're still with this body thing.  Look at that.  Can you see the boobs popping straight out? 
[00:14:00]  What a load of shit.  She's standing there drooping her belly and her tits.  And then they put this thing on her.  And now her tits are pushed up and her belly's pushed in.  She's still, you know, you wouldn't look at her in a bar unless it was really late.  Ooh.  Like, look how she's standing in that first one.  Slouch your shoulders.  And then the good one is like, all right, bring your shoulders back.  Look at this mess.  Holy good God.  What a huge beer belly.  And they wear that spandex kind of top to really accentuate the fatness. 
[00:14:30]  Well, they do it on purpose.  Like, no woman with a horrendous figure like that.  It's going to wear that.  Right.  They would pull the shirt down below their belt.  She's sweating out of her belly button, I think, too.  Just leaking.  Well, after I had my four children, it was very hard to get back in the shape.  So I don't know what to do.  Look at the belly hanging over the top.  Looks like me from the side.  That is an awful.  Look at that, Jimmy.  Wow. 
[00:15:00]  She has an awful body.  And then they measure her in the midsection.  And they barely tighten it up around her.  Yeah.  And then when she puts the girdle thing on, they're just squeezing that tape measure.  We see through your shenanigans.  Good news, though.  Her waist is 49 inches.  Jesus.  49.  49.  And then here she comes.  Oh, wow.  48.  Not much different. 
[00:15:30]  Look at that stomach looks so punchable.  I want to punch it.  I think I've been punching that at the gym.  It looks like the heavy bag.  Just punch it.  And look at our husband and our boyfriend or whatever.  He's just like, damn.  Look at you.  You look good.  Well, get all up inside that piece, yo.  Yes.  All right.  Why don't they measure it again?  She was so fat, they just had to put like a numbered hula hoop around her.  Step through this, manatee.  You fatso.  Hey, get a little fatso over there. 
[00:16:00]  Measure it now.  She's got the girl standing there.  Yeah, she's going to measure it.  And then you'll see how tight she winds the tape measure around her, too.  Yeah.  To measure it.  This commercial's been on for like an hour and a half.  It's endless.  It's my favorite show.  I know.  I watch these things sometimes late at night.  You just got to do nothing on.  You're just like, yeah, let me see what happens.  I fucking warmed up for one of these things before.  It's called the home right paint stick.  Oh, they're measuring.  They measured a little higher up that time. 
[00:16:30]  Here they go.  Oh, my God.  Way up.  Look how they measured under her tits.  Come on.  Get on that big fucking gut.  She lost four and a half inches.  Yeah, sure she did.  By just putting on this thing.  Look at her tits.  They're under her chin now.  How do they make her tits bigger?  What the hell's going on?  They put a bra on her.  There's a lot of trickery going on.  Yeah.  The fact that she's frowning in the first.  Yeah, because she's like, I'm a fat slob.  And then it's like, look, I'm wearing a girdle.  And the arms are going back.  Oh, what a joke. 
[00:17:00]  They have these infomercials where they're like, and how do we get that?  And we get the stupid studio audience.  Yeah.  And I was called the Home Right Paint Stick.  And I was doing a warm up for it.  The Home Right Paint Stick?  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  You were involved with that?  You don't remember it.  I do.  It was like the sponge on the end of the stick.  Yeah, that guy Jan who does all the, he's like, he's made a living doing infomercials.  He's the king of those.  Right.  Does he beat up hookers?  Oh, no, no.  Just the ShamWow guy?  Yeah.  It was him and the lady who was in all of them.  And I had to do warm up in between their thing. 
[00:17:30]  I would go out and tell jokes.  Holy shit.  I fucking bombed for six hours.  Oh, six hours.  It was so.  It got to a point.  The audience was nice, but I was just new and terrible.  So they started asking me questions while I was out there.  I was like, um.  And they're like, so why don't you tell us where you're going to be next?  Oh, they're interviewing you.  An infomercial audience who are the most, they're the worst.  Yeah.  Said it and forget it. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, they're all clapping.  And they make faces and point.  They go like, wow, wait.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that coffee pot.  Look at this hot thing.  Look at her.  Come get the fuck out of here.  She needs that.  She doesn't need that.  She doesn't need a girdle.  They're deep kicking.  They're showing someone that looks very close to a Megan Fox.  Smooth, bump-free silhouette.  Look at her.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  She needs a girdle.  She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her.  It squeezes her so tight, though. 
[00:18:30]  They don't show you the back of her panties.  She's turtling.  She has a little log poking out of the back.  Like a little tail.  A little stinker.  Jesus Christ.  Love those, though.  Yeah, all right.  Watch them all the time.  So you got the Marvin Gaye 25 years ago today.  Yeah.  Did you see the pictures of the new studio?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I saw Opiate Twitter those.  It was a retweet, my friend.  It was a retweet from the E-Rock?  It was an RT from E-Rock. 
[00:19:00]  I got you.  I'm hearing you.  Sometimes you got to do an RT because someone has something cool.  But I put those pictures up there without any commentary.  Yeah.  With just basic, here's, I actually wrote, here's the first look at our new studio.  That's all I wrote.  Yeah.  I didn't say nothing.  Read the comments.  Did you read the comments?  Oh, I certainly did.  I hope the bosses over there are reading the comments so they know we're not crazy.  Does it look a little bare?  Well, they're still building it.  I probably should have said that, but still. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  It looks small.  It's small than one of Anthony's gun closets.  Yes.  Yeah.  There were a lot of comments about its size.  A lot of comments.  And I didn't.  Lack thereof.  And I didn't set it up.  No.  I just wrote a basic, here is where we're going to be within a week, week and a half.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  No, I'm not even going to read the comments.  Let the listeners just do what they're going to do.  So, yeah.  One guy's like, where do we complain?  Where do we complain? 
[00:20:00]  Like, they're doing the radio show.  We want you in a bigger workspace.  They roll.  One guy just writes, who do I complain to?  We could have one studio audience member come up and sit on the couch.  I don't even think we could do that.  And then the office space.  Was that real?  There has to be another, like, room they're giving you guys.  What?  Because Ed and I gave up on having actual office space a long time ago.  We have, it's basically a carbon copy of that picture.  We have two offices that are that size.  Two?  Okay.  So, I misrepresented that a little bit. 
[00:20:30]  Because I said that one office was for eight to ten people.  Eight to ten people.  I know.  I was like, what the?  Which, by the way, it's probably more people than that.  Yeah.  But, I mean, that's just for, like, us.  I mean, our interns have to, like, sit outside somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're in the intern section, which seems to be wandering around the building.  Yeah.  Without any real home base.  Oh, are they going to hate us?  Because, you know what?  We got to do what we got to do to keep this show top notch.  Top notch.  We are going to take control of that entire floor.  We have to. 
[00:21:00]  There's going to be some problems, I think, with chemistry between us and other people  on the floor.  We're always the people that other people don't want near them.  So, I don't know.  I put those up there yesterday.  Yeah.  I've never seen more comments.  Oh, I know.  The comments were hysterical.  I'm going to go look at it now on the Twitter, right?  Oh, you just tweeted right up there, Jimmy Norton.  You didn't see them, Jimmy?  Oh, be wish. 
[00:21:30]  No, I didn't look.  A lot of people are confused.  They're like, where is Jimmy going to sit?  And I was looking at that like, wow, it's going to be.  Me and Jimmy are going to be very close together.  I don't like that.  Me and Jimmy are going to be very close.  I told him it has to be a perfect triangle.  Close enough to touch each other.  Triangulation of crossfire.  That's right.  The key is a perfect triangle.  I am going to have to have a gas mask for when Jimmy has some gassy days.  I'll just try not to get scared.  If I stay brave, we won't have any trouble.  Don't be frightened in the new studio. 
[00:22:00]  They obviously got big plans for us.  And if people thought we were bullshitting, they saw the glass for themselves.  Just glass everywhere over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Glass, glass, glass, glass, glass, glass.  You can hang up all kinds of posters like some of the people do in their offices.  Oh, yeah.  There are secret posters that they try to hide behind.  Oh, yeah.  While they're slacking.  Yeah.  There'll be a list of posters we're allowed to have, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we'll see the ones we're not allowed to have.  That one's a little too sexually. 
[00:22:30]  It'll harass some of the women that work here.  Enough.  At it.  Enough with the pistachio recall.  Anthony's bar in his house has more room than our fucking new studio.  It's just so funny what you guys post.  Yeah.  Because almost back to back, it's like, oh, post a picture.  Yeah, the new studio.  And it's like, yeah, the bar's almost done.  Here's my bar.  It's almost done.  That's the beauty of everyone's Twitter accounts.  Yeah.  You just post whatever the hell you want.  You get a little something different depending on who you're looking at. 
[00:23:00]  I'm doing a search for my cock ring.  Yes.  What different personalities we all have.  The cock ring, the bar, and the studio.  That pretty much really spells it out, doesn't it?  That place is tiny, man.  That place is tiny.  Oh, my God.  All right.  And the bottle.  Keith almost dropped the bottle of Louis Trey.  Here's the bar, motherfucker.  Yeah.  That's in your house?  Now we're drinking.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Jesus.  That's a nice one.  It's just got to get the taps in. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  The coolers are all in for the kegs.  It looks like an old Guinness.  Kind of looks old school a little bit.  That's right, Lloyd.  Hair of the dog that bit me, Lloyd.  That's what I was going for.  Kind of like an old Western feel to it, almost.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm talking really old school.  Yeah.  Doc Brown.  A little Doc Brown action.  And Back to the Future 3.  Yeah.  And then the brass foot rail comes in in a couple of weeks.  And then the bar stools, and I'll be ready to fall off of one.  A little, do a little, what? 
[00:24:00]  William Holden, was it?  Yeah.  A little Bill Holden.  A little bit.  Plonk.  There he goes.  Bill enjoyed a spa.  He could have lived through that, William Holden.  But he was very private, and he just went to bed after he smashed his head.  Yeah.  He liked the nice smashing of the head.  He probably had a nice belt before that, too.  He was probably drunk, and instead of just calling the cops and going, look, I fucked up  or whatever.  He just was like, ah, he didn't want to deal with it.  He didn't want any bad publicity.  Speaking of drunk, did you guys see the story in the paper of that reporter, Mike Sheehan?  Oh, I thought you said Mike Hunt. 
[00:24:30]  No, Mike Sheehan.  Mike Sheehan used to work for the NYPD, and now he's been a reporter for many, many  years.  They're basically saying that he hit a horse on one day.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I saw his car was all wrapped up, and they charged him with a DUI or something because  he refused to take any tests on scene.  Yeah, that's pretty much what you're supposed to do.  And now his lawyer's saying, how could he hit a horse with the side of his car?  Oops.  And I think Mike Sheehan was quoted as saying, what?  I didn't hit nothing. 
[00:25:00]  I didn't hit anything.  As his windshield is completely smashed in, and the side of his car is smashed in.  There's a horse shoe in his passenger seat.  And a horse was injured, but they didn't have to put the horse down.  Oats in his ashtray.  Yeah.  Where is it?  Give me that paper.  I didn't hit any horse.  What are you talking about?  I don't have my papers today.  What are you talking about?  I think it was in the Daily News or the Post.  It's one of these.  Here it is.  Cop turned TV reporter Mike Sheehan was reined in at a Manhattan court yesterday after Bazaar. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, I get it.  An allegedly drunken fender bender with an NYPD horse in Tribeca.  Sheehan 60, a senior Fox 5 correspondent, was arrested late Monday after colliding with the animal named Manhattan.  Uh-oh.  Who was being ridden against traffic.  And then this is Sheehan's quote.  This is what I want to read.  What's the matter?  I didn't hit nothing.  That's a good quote when you're drunk and hitting a horse.  I didn't hit nothing.  And then his lawyer said, how do you hit a horse with the side of your car? 
[00:26:00]  You can't, he said.  It's Mr. Sheehan's position that the horse ran into his car.  Ah.  So.  And on the horse.  And the car looks like it's pretty messed up.  Maybe the windshield wasn't damaged.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  It looks like the driver's window's out.  Yeah.  The driver's window's definitely out.  I thought I read, too, that the windshield was all messed up, so.  Good old Michael, uh, Mike Sheehan.  Mike Sheehan.  People know him here in New York City.  He's one of those tough reporters.  Yeah, huh?  And gets to the bottom of everything.  I think a lot of reporters like to tip a few. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, I think it's just the nature of the job.  Yeah, they all have their local watering hole.  Yeah, yeah.  They leave, like, the studio, and then they all are like, hey, how about a drink?  I'll see you down at the Irish bar.  Yeah, and then they'll hang out there drinking.  Until 11 o'clock.  Well, look at their job.  Six and 11.  There's a sports reporter in my neighborhood.  He just sits at an outside diner between 7 and 10.30, smoking cigars.  I'm like, you're the sports guy.  You're supposed to be on top of the sports. 
[00:27:00]  You go, ah, you got him Twittered to me.  You got some emails.  Dude, he just hangs out, socializes, then you see him walking back around 10, 10.15 for the 11 o'clock.  Got a sports app.  Speaking of reporters, Len Berman was shown the door.  Yeah.  I think people around the country know Len Berman, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I think he does enough national stuff.  Yeah, you'd know him.  NBC here in New York City is just falling apart.  Cost-cutting move, they said.  Well, they didn't say.  They said it was mutual. 
[00:27:30]  No.  He's looking to do different things.  It was one of these typical corporate bullshit lines.  Yeah, they don't tell you the truth.  No, he was making too much money, so they showed him the door.  Yeah, because they sort of said that to Tom Chiasano.  After all those years, Tom decided he wanted to go see what else he could do with his career.  I want to pursue other interests outside of the radio industry.  Yeah, we saw him in his office crying as he was getting his boxes together. 
[00:28:00]  That's not a man that wants to pursue other things.  By the way, he didn't cry.  He's a tough man.  I was just pumping it up a little bit.  When K-Rock decided to flip formats and we were no longer going to be part of that organization,  I got a call from Tom Chiasano that I didn't take.  Good.  Because I just, nothing against Tom, I just couldn't sit there on the phone.  I was already like, eh, fuck, this sucks.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to sit there and commiserate with another person who was shown the door. 
[00:28:30]  When he was shown the door, you knew that they were going for something else.  Something was happening.  They were going to just take their time getting to us, but we knew we were the last ones.  The amazing invisible general manager that showed up.  Yeah.  First, there was Maura.  Maura liked to, allegedly, to tip a few.  I don't know if she tipped a few.  She drank a little Maura than everyone else.  She sure did.  Yeah, but Len Berman was showing the door and stupid Al Roker tweeted that. 
[00:29:00]  Is everyone doing the tweet thing?  Apparently so.  There's a bunch of celebrity tweeting going on.  I can't call it tweeting, though.  I got to call it twittering.  Yeah, tweeting sounds a little too.  Tweeting is so fucking gay.  Twittering is much more masculine.  Yeah, isn't it?  NBC, they listed all the people they fired since January.  It got so bad that Sue Simmons, remember her?  Yeah.  She's got some rumors that she likes to tip them back between newscasts.  There's some rumors.  Remember the F-bomb that Sue Simmons did? 
[00:29:30]  The famous clip?  Supposedly it got so bad at NBC locally that she was doing the sports.  Really?  One day she had to do sports because they didn't have anybody.  Wow.  They were firing everybody.  And this isn't like small town news.  No.  This is New York City.  But like we were saying, the executives seem to all keep their jobs.  Yeah.  Like they get rid of the talent end of it.  Yeah.  But the executives, man, they just keep their frigging jobs, don't they? 
[00:30:00]  Well, they're the ones they go after next.  But they're not high profile, so when they get fired, you don't even know.  You don't know about it, but, you know, we do.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  They just did a close-up on Cindy Crawford's mole.  Yeah.  That's not happening.  That hasn't been happening for at least a decade.  Wouldn't that be odd if she was like, kiss me?  And you're just like, I...  And you're sticking to the one side of her mouth that the mole isn't on, just kind of...  I'm not a fan of the mole close to the lip.  No. 
[00:30:30]  You can deal with the mole here and there, but the ones close to the lip, I don't know.  No, it's not...  If it's not raised up like that, there's not a problem with it.  It's just, you know, what's called a beauty mark.  Yeah.  Yeah, look, I got a beauty mark.  If you have to call it a beauty mark, I don't think it's too beautiful.  Look at that thing.  Dude, there's a darker spot in the middle of it where you know the hairs grow out of.  Right.  Like, she's probably constantly...  Look.  Yeah.  Look at there just showing it.  There's a close-up on it.  You know how easy it is to get rid of that dumb thing these days? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, please.  I'd go for mole removal.  Let's take it off.  I've been known to take a mole or two off.  Use a little...  Yeah.  Yeah, you could do that now.  Pop that out.  But she probably thinks of it and all of her yes people tell her, no.  No, it's your personality.  That's your trademark.  She should cut it out and then sell it on eBay.  Floating in a little thing of formaldehyde.  Just a tiny little jar.  Yeah.  Hey, I got Cindy Crawford's mole. 
[00:31:30]  How cool would that be, though, to display?  Put it in a contact holder.  Yeah.  It's like, dude, you want to see Cindy Crawford's mole?  Hey, that'd be kind of cool.  Look at it.  Stop that thing.  I would bid on that.  Yeah.  You just collect celebrities' removed moles.  Yeah.  By the way, driving in today, I guess we got another surcharge being thrown at us?  Could be another, yeah, surcharge.  Another tax going in.  Could someone explain the surcharge? 
[00:32:00]  What is a surcharge, Ian?  It's a tax that they don't want to call a tax because tax is a bad word.  But surcharge makes it sound like they need it for some reason to run the thing that you're paying the surcharge on.  Well, they're hitting up the cabbies.  The funny thing with the cabbies, because they're bitching and complaining, but they got a nice little deal when the gas prices went way up.  Yeah, they were able to charge a gas surcharge.  I hate the system in general, but I'm not feeling sorry for the cabbies this morning because, yeah, the gas surcharge was put into effect when gas was way up there. 
[00:32:30]  Remember?  Yeah.  That was, what, eight months ago, something like that?  Yep.  And gas dropped drastically down to levels that we could all deal with, and they never took that gas surcharge away, and they never will.  Nope.  So now that they're throwing another $0.50 surcharge on the cabbies, I don't feel that, I mean, it sucks because I don't know how people in the end are going to afford all this, but.  Is it $0.50 for this one?  Yeah.  Yeah, just another $0.50 here.  $0.50. 
[00:33:00]  Another $0.50 here, another $0.50 here.  Everything goes up to the, and you get it all up, and that's where the problem is.  It's a surcharge.  Again, it's going to go to the MTA.  Right.  This MTA, the head of the MTA, should be dragged out and hung up like Mussolini was.  Right.  This, what, what, just mismanagement is going on in the MTA?  Why don't you hear that ever from the politicians, from anybody? 
[00:33:30]  Just say something.  No one says mismanagement.  I mean, if you live around New York City, you just watch the cars just lining up to ka-ching, ka-ching.  That's all I see is ka-ching, ka-ching.  It's going to be my turn to ka-ching in 30 cars.  Ka-ching, ka-ching.  Yeah.  How is it broke?  They're losing money.  Stop it.  How is it broke for real?  Because somebody is screwing up Royal with the way they're handling that money.  You know, you go to these other cities, they got brand new subways, gorgeous systems. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Our system sucks.  They throw a new train in every once in a while, but the system is horrendous.  There's a commercial on now, too, pleading with New Yorkers.  It says, call your congressman and tell them you don't want cuts made on the transit system.  Right.  It'll only make subways unsafer, less people to watch for safety, less people to clean up the trains and this, blah, blah, and the whole thing.  And then it's sponsored by the transit union, the people that want to keep their job. 
[00:34:30]  Of course they're going to say.  Right.  It's not.  The commercial, if it was honest, would go, hey, could you call your congressman for me so I don't lose my job?  Mm-hmm.  But they try to make it, they scare you by trying to go like, there'll be less people to make you safe, less people to clean the cars.  Brought to you by the transit workers of, it's like, well, okay.  It's just amazing.  And then the big one, another cigarette tax going into effect. 
[00:35:00]  Really?  Federal cigarette tax, not a state one.  New York State already jacked it up to a ridiculous point.  But if you're still smoking out there, holy shit, are you in for an unpleasant surprise.  Another buck and a half, I think, around there for cigarettes.  Bringing, I guess Travis said, a pack of Parliaments out by the little magazine stand.  Yeah.  $11 a pack. 
[00:35:30]  $11.  $11 for a pack of 20 cigarettes.  Who the fuck could afford that?  $11?  How much were they?  I quit back in December of 2001, which is, I guess, what, seven and a half years ago?  Seven, eight years ago.  Eight years.  I don't remember what they were.  Can you check what cigarette prices in New York were?  I'm going to guess $7.  You know what?  When I was in high school and just started smoking, $0.75 a pack.  Damn.  $0.75.  They just invented the cigarettes back then.  Three, yes, exactly. 
[00:36:00]  We rolled them ourselves like cowboys.  You got to be consistent.  You threw three quarters on that counter and you got yourself a pack of Marlboro.  We got to be consistent.  I'm not a big fan of the smoker, but they're getting screwed too.  They're just taxing the hell out of them.  That's just amazing.  The syntax.  It's a sin what you're doing.  What the hell is a syntax?  The syntax is a computer language.  And if it doesn't understand, you get a syntax error.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:36:30]  Boo.  It's considered the things that are sins, like booze.  Oh, really?  Is that where that comes from?  Cigarettes.  I never knew that until just now.  Strip clubs.  Anything naughty.  Anything you're doing that can be considered naughty.  Anything a little naughty.  Carnal or naughty.  You should call it the naughty tax.  And it's easy.  Naughty.  Naughty tax.  It's easy for the politicians to tax it because you got to be the guy that goes,  Hey, I want my whores tax-free.  Right.  Yeah, that one's a biggie. 
[00:37:00]  11 bucks.  What's that?  $110 for a carton of cigarettes?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  $110.  That's fucking...  I think they're basically telling people they don't want them smoking anymore.  Yeah.  I think they're basically saying, just stop already.  Travis has now alerted me that a PlayStation 2 costs less than a carton of cigarettes.  Really?  Really?  You can't play with cigarettes.  $99.  That's hysterical.  And there's no one going to fight for the tobacco companies, and they shouldn't because 
[00:37:30]  they have done nothing but lie.  Once you get caught lying enough times, it's like, you're fucked.  There's nothing they can do to defend themselves.  You know what, though?  It's not hurting the tobacco industry.  They're just...  Look worldwide is where you got to look.  The tobacco...  American cigarettes are friggin' coveted overseas.  They're still selling, but...  They're selling like crazy.  The people are getting hit with...  It's so socially unacceptable to smoke.  Yeah.  One of the reasons I quit is because I was torn with Dice, and I almost missed a connecting 
[00:38:00]  flight from Houston, because I had to go outside and smoke.  And then you're sitting there waiting for the plane.  It's like, it just became so fucking annoying.  I just...  And the health risk, and finally I said, fuck it.  You were a prisoner, Jim.  It was an awful thing when you were tied up for hours in a place where you're putting  smoke, like in the plane, when you're flying, and all you're thinking is, oh, God, I want  to get off this thing and just take the giant drag.  You light the cigarette, one drag, it's down to the filter. 
[00:38:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  So you don't miss that.  And because it's unacceptable everywhere, it's like they...  People are quitting.  And worldwide, it's like in Ireland, you can't smoke in bars.  You can't smoke in bars in most places because the fucking health risk is too expensive.  Savage nations, though, they smoke like crazy.  They give out his fucking lunch snacks for the kids.  Japan, they love Asian nations, they love their American cigarettes.  Oh, do they love them.  Eventually they'll just be...  If the FDA ever fucking declares it a drug... 
[00:39:00]  That'll never happen.  Maybe not, but...  No, it happens.  The states that grow tobacco are the good old boy states from so many years ago.  And they just have these favors that are done.  Why would a politician in Virginia, where they grow a fuckload of tobacco...  Right.  Why would he agree to any kinds of laws against the tobacco industry when his whole state is  based on tobacco money? 
[00:39:30]  Mm-hmm.  And even his buddies in states that don't grow tobacco...  The good old boys.  They're good old boys.  They're all buddies.  They know because they have their fucking product that they don't want this guy fucking with.  Right.  So they constantly, you know, they're fine with everything.  Booze, same thing, you know?  Mm-hmm.  That's what the country was built on pretty much.  Yeah, tobacco, man.  Tobacco tax and booze.  Tobacco and booze and cotton.  Well, this guy paid...  A striker paid...  Striker!  ...$6 for cigarettes in Wyoming. 
[00:40:00]  All right, good for you.  Yeah, pretty cheap.  Let's go to Jay in Jersey.  Jay!  All right.  He said go fuck yourself.  He was talking about a $150 surcharge on a speeding ticket or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, tickets, they give you a surcharge on the ticket.  And the faster you go, the bigger the surcharge is.  That's called a fine.  That's the fine.  Right.  Don't tell me...  Well...  Why does the surcharge go up?  And the judge, when you go to court, the judge will usually go like,  all right, the fine is $80 with a $20 surcharge. 
[00:40:30]  Boom.  And you're like, all right, so it's a $100 fine.  I don't give a shit where it's going.  What's the sur...  What is the surcharge in that case?  I don't know!  It's so annoying not to know.  It is just another way of fucking you without saying we're fucking you.  Oh, we're the biggest wimps in this country.  We just keep dealing with it.  Let it keep going.  And there's nothing we can do about it.  Revolution.  You know.  Revolution!  We're so free in this country, right?  We're so free. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Are we really?  Eh, no.  I know there's worse places to live.  I'm not stupid, but we're not really that free.  There's this illusion that is America.  Right.  And then there's reality.  Yeah.  You know, when you buy a house and your little property and stuff...  Do you really own the house?  You don't own it.  Do you really own it?  You don't own it.  You don't own the property.  You can't do anything that you want on the property without going through all kinds of  red tape.  And a lot of times they tell you no.  You're pretty much under the thumb of local, federal, state governments that just tell you 
[00:41:30]  what you can and can't do on the property that you bought...  But I own it.  ...that you pay taxes on...  But I own it.  It's mine.  It's mine.  I got my little plot of land...  Yeah.  ...and it's all...  What?  I can't put a fence around it?  Right.  What?  There's a statute about fences?  But I didn't vote for that.  I wish I could have lived in the old days where you just see a nice piece of land on top 
[00:42:00]  of a hill and you just go, ah, it's mine.  Mine.  Then you build a big fence and then no one questioned you.  Or then they'd open up a bunch of land.  Like, they'd open up a shitload of land out west.  Right.  And they'd have people waiting on horseback with wagons and everything.  And they would just tell them, all right, go!  And then you rode as fast as you could to a piece of land that you wanted and you staked  your claim.  You took stakes and put it and said, this shit's mine. 
[00:42:30]  And that's it.  You think there was one dummy that staked the claim, like, as small as our studio that  we're moving into?  Yeah.  This is mine.  You had the chance to take the whole block and decided, oh, I just need 20 by 20.  That's all I need for a little house.  A little house.  That's all I want.  I don't even need a backyard.  I've got to build a barn, but I can't fit it.  You know somebody.  Let's go to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn!  Red paddle, Opie.  Red paddle.  No, I've been good.  I've been good. 
[00:43:00]  Well, just now when you were talking about the 20 by 20.  Yeah, there you go.  First of all, I called about cigarettes.  They just went up $10 of cotton in PA.  They're going up another $7 today.  And actually, roll your own tobacco.  $25 a pound the taxes going up.  And the surcharge in Pennsylvania, if I remember correctly, when I got a ticket on it, it was for EMS and ambulance.  It's like, why am I paying that? 
[00:43:30]  Because they probably figure that you're speeding.  Yeah.  So the argument is you're causing a hazard.  Right.  Right.  Danny gave me a note.  Cigarettes in 2001 between $6.50 and $7.50 a pack.  So they've gone up $4 or $5?  No, if you look at $7, I mean, they've gone up to $11.  I mean, they've gone up $5.  Wait, $8, $9.  I'm sorry, $4.  That's a lot.  Yeah.  That is a lot.  That's a percentage.  I don't know what it is.  Screwing our smokers out there.  And it's all, yeah, these taxes. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, let's say hi to Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's going on?  Scott.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, my brother just got a surcharge from New Jersey.  Scott and brother got a surcharge and he went to paying tickets and all the money in Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He got the surcharge for tickets in 1983.  They just surcharged him.  The state is going back and collecting old monies to him.  Are you kidding? 
[00:44:30]  No, he got three speeding tickets in 1983, and now they're just now surcharging him for the DMV tickets.  You know him, the Don from Mr. Pest?  We don't know him.  No, we don't know him.  Yes, you do.  We never know him.  Shut up.  I never heard of Don from that stupid site.  Thank you, Scott.  All right.  Let's say how.  Got to set him straight sometimes.  Certainly do.  Let's say how to Trey in Detroit.  Someone's bitching because the rolling papers are going up.  That's just a pain in the ass.  Just buy cigarettes like everyone else.  Stop rolling your own cigarettes.  Well, maybe it's not cigarettes. 
[00:45:00]  Well, true.  Dupage.  Actually, he was claiming it was for his cigs.  Yeah, for his cigarettes.  He's full of shit.  He doesn't lay around with drinks on him.  Yeah, Travolta at Jackrabbit Slims.  Pultage.  Perfect.  Very good.  Trey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hi, Trey.  Jimmy, I love you.  We turned around in Detroit.  They call it driver responsibility.  If you get a hundred dollar ticket for three years, you got to pay the secretary of state 
[00:45:30]  a hundred dollars for driver responsibility.  So if you get a fine, you got to pay each and every time for every year.  No matter how many tickets you get, you got to pay that fine every three years.  I want to know, again, I want to know who these politicians that come up with these things,  who are they representing?  They're supposed to represent the people.  Another part of this American fantasy.  Right.  They're supposed to represent the people.  I believe in the oldie days, there was a representative that you could go to as the people and say, 
[00:46:00]  this is what we want you to take to Washington and pitch for us.  Sure.  And they would do that.  And then they'd come back and say, well, I got some of it.  I got this.  I couldn't get anything.  Whatever.  That's the rep.  And based on how well he did for his people, his constituency, he would either get reelected  reelected or they'd throw him the fuck out and get someone that's going to do the bidding  of the people.  Right. 
[00:46:30]  Now, apparently, I don't know one stupid motherfucker that would go, yes, I want a surcharge on  tickets.  I want taxes up the ass on cigarettes.  For my people.  I want fucking income tax.  I want this.  You're representing us.  Right.  And that's what you go to Washington.  Yeah.  And you tell them we want to spend more money.  No one did this.  Who are they representing?  I don't know.  It turned into this big bullshit story. 
[00:47:00]  Well, I guess that was put in place when the towns only had 40 people.  So you could kind of get the town together.  But there isn't one person that they're representing with these laws that you know no one agrees  with.  But I guess what I'm saying is they had good intentions back when this all started.  Now they represent the businesses that give them kickbacks and election money and contracts  for their state.  They represent, they don't represent people anymore.  I'm about solutions.  What can we do, Ant? 
[00:47:30]  There's nothing we can do, right?  What was that quote?  I believe it was from Thomas Jefferson.  Looks like a wallet.  What?  Oh, Jesus.  No, Thomas Jefferson.  I'm not sure if it was him.  It was something about democracy and the tree of democracy.  If the tree of democracy is not planted, there will not be roots that give fruit that we  can enjoy.  I believe it must be watered with the blood of tyrants or some shit like that. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, really?  It was something really cool sounding that I don't fucking remember for the life of me.  I actually do know it.  Yes?  The tree of democracy must be watered with the semen I shoot that leaks out of slave vagina.  That might have been what Jefferson said.  Thomas Jefferson said.  What Jefferson was saying is, hey.  I bet you that was the original quote and then someone's like, you know, Tom, we got  to clean this up a little bit.  Jesus.  We'll just be perverse. 
[00:48:30]  Bogus, too.  Right.  All right, Mr. Hand.  Let's go after the tyrants.  Let's get that going.  See what happens to you.  I know.  The days of the big.  Yeah.  It starts off standing on a soapbox and gathering people around and being rousy.  Lost it a bit.  And then it just it spreads and fans out into revolution.  Oh, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Nowadays, it starts that way. 
[00:49:00]  It ends with a good tasing.  It starts with you on a soapbox.  The second one person steps in front of you.  OK, everybody disband.  Disband.  This is a public place and you're not allowed to have this unless you have a permit.  You're two people standing in the same spot.  But you know something?  We're of free Americans.  You'll be tased, sir.  You're going to get tased.  You know, I don't care about your fascist way. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  That's why they came up with the permit.  Yeah.  So you can't do this stuff anymore.  You can't do things that can get the people riled.  You know, that dopey Central Park that is as big as, I think, Rhode Island.  It's a massive park.  You need a permit just to get a...  If you want to get a little picnic going with your family.  A picnic!  I think it's more than 10 people or something like that.  Yeah, 10 people.  A little family reunion.  Whatever.  You need a permit.  Because they're too paranoid that you're making believe you're having a picnic, but you're getting the people together for a little something something. 
[00:50:00]  And do you know, in the Constitution, you have the right to assemble.  Well, as long as you get a permit, my friend.  But then they put this permit thing on it, and then they don't just give you...  You can't say, all right, I want the right to assemble.  I got a bunch of people.  I'm not sure how many.  I'm just going to be speaking.  Well, what are you talking about?  I don't know.  I'm just going to be talking.  I have the right to assemble.  Yeah.  Not permit denied.  But the Constitution...  See, it says I have the... 
[00:50:30]  No.  It's really turned into something that is just a bastardized version of what it was supposed to be.  Are we still in a democracy in this country?  No.  The scales have tipped.  We like to say that, but...  The scales have tipped.  What are we mostly?  We're in between a...  It's a lot of things.  There's a lot more socialism now.  Right.  That's obvious.  But what would you label the country right now?  It doesn't seem too democratic. 
[00:51:00]  It's not...  It's to a few things.  There's a little fascism in there.  It's a mixed bag.  Yeah, it is a mixed bag.  I think the reason you could still call it a democracy is because we have the Congress  and the Senate and the President and all his clowns, the Cabinet.  But the truth of the matter is, on your local level, when you're just walking the streets  and you're not dealing with your congressmen and things like that,  you really are less free to do things than you are more free to do things. 
[00:51:30]  You can't just do stuff.  You have to really toe the line no matter what you're doing on any given day.  When you leave this studio and walk on the streets, you're constantly doing things to stop from getting in trouble.  That's what you're doing.  How free are you if every step you take, you're trying to stay out of trouble?  Well, what defines a true democracy, though? 
[00:52:00]  Because when you look at something like Proposition 8, which I don't agree with, but it's like...  That's where you're able to just suck another man's dick any time you want.  Yes, it's spelled A-T-E.  Yes.  I voted yes!  But it's like they passed it.  The people hated it.  Right.  They do a referendum and they voted it out.  Voted it out.  But it's like...  But it passed.  I don't like it.  I mean, the government acts...  I'm not saying they're not pieces of shit.  They did something that they thought was according to the will of the people or as elected officials, 
[00:52:30]  how they felt best represented their constituency.  People said no and they got to put on a referendum and they said, fuck this, and they voted it out.  It's amazing that people are only that proactive when it comes to something that violates a religious belief like gay marriage.  Right.  But people aren't really that proactive with most shit.  But if people are, things get done.  I mean, because politicians are afraid of being voted out.  That's what it is.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what makes it, defines a democracy, like to say, but...  You know what?  They've gotten to the point, too, where you bring up a good point about politicians are afraid of being voted out. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Yet the collective of all of them has this thing going on where they can get away with taxing the shit out of us.  Right.  But they're all in it.  So we get to the point where we're just like, well, if you vote him out, the next guy just does the same thing.  So you'll start, they distract you with other issues.  Like, you know, obviously people argue at this point, but the abortion issue, you know, there are some people that have no right even discussing it. 
[00:53:30]  They have no power over whether Roe versus Wade gets overturned.  Yet their platform is something they throw out there every time re-election rolls around to distract you from the fact that you just got taxed up your asshole.  But, you know, it's this collective politics thing that is more important now than the independent representatives of each person.  Can we look online, Danny?  Can you see what's the most fine of democracy?  I want to go back to something you said. 
[00:54:00]  Like you said, when you leave the studio, it's all about not getting in trouble.  Not getting in trouble.  And it brought me back because I love watching old videos of New York City at the turn of the century.  It wasn't about that at all.  No.  You see a street, there's like, there's like sort of like the horse and buggies.  There's a guy just on a horse.  There's all this crap going on.  There's no.  Some guy with an apple cart just selling shit outside of his house.  Just like walking across the street.  There's no traffic lights. 
[00:54:30]  There's no traffic pattern.  You don't even know where to walk.  I don't even think they had sidewalks yet.  Everyone was just walking in the street in a path they were just finding on their own.  Now you just.  And now it's like, oh, God, if I even attempt to cross when it's green, I'm going to get hit over the head with something.  It's like I could, you know, cross from one corner to the other corner and cut out that middleman 90 degree angle thing, the jaywalking.  I love the willy nilly years.  Yeah, the willy nilly years. 
[00:55:00]  Is that what it was called?  Yeah, let's redefine it.  The willy nilly years.  Yeah, you just do whatever you want.  I don't know what's going on.  The cop would just walk around swinging his billy club, whistling.  Just randomly hitting someone because he goes, I guess I got to do something.  Drunk Irish guy would rouse someone every so often.  Half the people had electricity.  The other half didn't.  Yeah, the other half didn't.  Cares.  And then there was a time where the horse and buggies were on the road with cars.  Yeah, with cars.  And now you walk outside. 
[00:55:30]  The second I get in my vehicle, I'm just like, OK, what can I have to get home without getting in trouble?  It's all about straight lines now.  Straight lines.  No matter what you do, just if you want to keep it safe, just be in a straight line.  Yeah.  Whether you're in a car, on the sidewalk, buying something, just as long as you stay in a straight line, you're good.  No one's going to bother you.  Be a good boy.  Try to do a little zig and zag.  And you're going to bring attention to yourself and you're going to get in trouble.  There's no zigzagging in this day and age. 
[00:56:00]  The willy nilly years.  Even the trains.  That was.  They didn't even have good tracks yet.  They're just like steep left turns and a right turn.  They didn't want to like, you know, knock anything down to make the straight lines yet.  It's just, it's, it's, it's just this real bastardized version.  You got it, Jim?  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted to update you.  It was a, a democracy is a government by the people, especially rule the majority, a government  in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly 
[00:56:30]  through a system of representation, usually involving periodically held free elections.  We are democracy.  See, no, no, we're not.  Not a perfectly run one.  We, we, no, we, we.  The beginning of that says, it says it all.  These people are not representing us.  Maybe not well.  They are, they're not, they don't have our good wishes in their minds and in their hands  when they go to Washington to write bills, to help write bills, to pass bills. 
[00:57:00]  They don't have our best interest in their mind.  It's, it's the companies that give them money.  That's whose interest they have.  Their states, the, I'll give it that they're, they're interested in their state to get their  state more money.  But it's not for the people.  It's for his fucking interests.  But for the people is, is almost like, that's a motive of the politician.  But it used to be, there were town hall meetings where people would go, and I understand this 
[00:57:30]  is ancient, it'd be very difficult.  People are busy these days.  But they've, I think if it's gotten to that point where you're too distracted and too busy  because of the way things are to do this.  There were town hall meetings.  You would go there.  Your representative is there.  They would discuss things.  The representative would then find out what the majority of those people wanted.  He would then take that back with him to the next guy up the, up the ladder.  And it would go to the, the supreme powers that be, and they would see if they could negotiate 
[00:58:00]  your wishes.  Yes.  But they don't do that anymore.  And when they couldn't, the North fights the South.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  It was like, it was a more direct involvement.  But look at what we have today and the amount of people we have to, like, I'd love to see  those assholes with their horse and buggies try to navigate the amount of people we have  and the amount of technology and the amount of potential problems.  Right.  And airline traffic.  I understand.  Like, every law is there because somebody fucked up.  Like, nobody cared when you crossed sideways on the street when there was a horse. 
[00:58:30]  But now that a, when a bus hits some jerk off, the rest of us are stuck for four hours  on 57th Street.  We're like, just put a light in.  Right.  If there was no lights, we'd all just be honking at each other.  It's like, we've asked people, all right, fuck it.  I just want to get up and go to work.  Somebody organized this shit.  And they're like, all right, yellow, red, green.  All right.  That works.  That works for me.  Straight lines.  Straight lines for everybody.  The thing is, the representation, it's just not there. 
[00:59:00]  It's terrible.  It's not there.  It's a joke.  Because I want to find who a politician is representing when you read some of these tax  laws, when you see that income tax is going up, that Congress is getting a raise,  that the, like, who, who did they meet with that they are representing that said, this  is what the people want.  Well, they go to.  They want to be taxed up the asshole.  They go to the diner every once in a while and talk to the people. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, that's great.  When they're like, oh, the press is there.  Hey, I'm eating a sandwich with the people.  See, I'm with the people.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's only during the election.  Yeah.  Let me take this.  And then they hide for their home term.  Let me take this and pound it in your ass with a lump hammer.  Right.  And then I'll leave.  It's not.  The system of representation is over, Johnny.  Over.  Why don't we take a break?  Good start to the show.  None of this stuff will be figured out, though.  We just have to take it.  No.  Just got to take it.  Right up the fuck hole. 
[01:00:00]  We need foreign invasion.  We have a two-system party.  Yeah, man, that might work.  Two-party system, that's the problem.  Yeah.  There's only two parties.  They don't have to answer.  If you had more people getting involved than maybe a third or fourth party, that's different.  I agree with you, Jimmy, but I'm all about solutions.  Go down to Washington and just go, you know what?  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  I don't think.  Ah!  No problem.  No problem.  You were within a mile of the White House, sir.  Yes.  We have to arrest you.  You will be tased.  Move back. 
[01:00:30]  You will be tased.  I don't care about your fashion.  Just blah!  I'm all about the solution.  Yeah.  There's nothing we can do.  Except take it.  Just take it.  More surcharges and sin taxes.  Surcharges, taxes, that, the other thing.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Just work and take home less than half your money.  That's sick.  Go ahead.  How we got to the point.  Yeah, that's a great thing where I would like to say who are they representing.  What people said, I want to work, but I only want half my money. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  I want the other half to just be spread around, and I don't know where it's going, and I want  surcharges and vague worded things that I don't know where the fuck my money's going,  but I trust you with it.  Yeah.  You wouldn't give fucking your family or friends that much money if you knew what they were  spending it on.  Sick.  Hey, dude, I really need a car.  I can't get to work.  Hey, dude, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and fucking get yourself a car.  But you're willing to just, hey, here, take it. 
[01:01:30]  Half my money.  It's your tax analogy.  I love it.  Yeah.  Because another tax going into effect with the cabs is a 50 cent surcharge.  But that's like turning up the water that is slowly boiling.  Just one degree.  No one's going to feel it.  A little bit.  No one's going to feel it.  And then another degree here, another degree there.  Next thing you know, you're like, how do we get this pot of boiling water?  Your skin's boiling off the bone.  Right.  I love that analogy.  Bastards.  You should explain the analogy because I'm just kind of. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, it's an old one.  I'm kind of referring to the analogy without really explaining it.  It's the old frog in the pot.  Right.  The frog in the pot of water.  If you put a frog in a pot of boiling water, he's dead.  He's going to just sit there.  Right.  But if you put him in a pot of water and then slowly turn the heat up, he'll be alive  for a while.  And he'll be like, this ain't so bad.  Yeah, he'll take it for a long time.  He'll take it for a long time.  He won't jump out.  But if you put a frog in a pot of boiling water, that thing will try to jump.  He's going to try to get the fuck out of there.  Immediately.  Yeah, they turned the heat up on us so slowly over so many years that we just kind of took 
[01:02:30]  it because it was one little thing at a time.  And then you reach this point and you're like, now they're not even trying a little bit at  a time.  This is blatant up your ass taxing.  Right.  That they're proud of.  That this economic environment has given them this carte blanche, which is taxing.  The shit out of us.  And one guy, Obama's whole platform was, and the Democrats are like this always, tax and  spend, was, hey, we got to tax it.  We got to get out of this problem. 
[01:03:00]  We're in the problem.  We got to get out of this problem.  And then everyone else jumps on board.  Every local official goes, yeah, yeah, we're in trouble.  Yeah, tax.  Obama did it.  So we can do it.  Amazing.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We got a big audience here already.  It's already.  And it's only three in the morning.  Holy shit.  It's amazing that this has to go away.  It's so ridiculous.  That's great.  Hey.  I like to fill it up with water and watch them drown.  Wouldn't that be great?  Wouldn't that be so cool?  They'll be pounding on the glass.  Help. 
[01:03:30]  We'd be laughing.  Jerking off.  Jerking off.  We'll make you laugh right to the end, though.  What the hell?  Yeah.  We'll have some chuckles.  J-Line from Boston.  Big news.  WBCN just flipped formats to pop.  Check the day, you idiots.  I got it.  Just check the day, you idiots.  I love Toucher & Rich, but stop.  BCN did not go pop today.  Are they possibly playing pop songs right now? 
[01:04:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  You wouldn't switch formats on April Fool's.  No.  A couple people buying into it.  I hate to blow up their spot, but come on.  Oh, my God.  But this news just in about Bloomberg.  Huh?  Nothing.  Oh, Jesus.  Nothing at all.  He's fine, and he's just waking up and going to work.  Having his first cup of coffee.  Yes.  Nothing to report here.  Nothing you see here.  Move along.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll continue. 
[01:04:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
