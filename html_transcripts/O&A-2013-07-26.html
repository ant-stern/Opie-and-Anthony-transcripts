<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcasting live from the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, was a raucous affair.  The pre-show, hosted by Sam Roberts with Travis, Gary, Roland, and Troy in the studio (later joined by Eric Nagel and Mark Zito), focused heavily on the previous day's show featuring comedians Joe DeRosa, Bob Kelly, Chris DiStefano, John Mulaney, and Tom Papa.  DeRosa’s repeated, unsolicited comments about wanting to perform fellatio on a transvestite friend dominated the discussion, prompting speculation about his motivations. Other pre-show highlights included Bob Kelly asking Opie about tasting his own semen, a four-year-old's reaction to a sexually suggestive joke by "Uncle Paul," anecdotes about the crew's pool experience (especially Roland's swimming struggles and matching outfit), and encounters with numerous celebrities including Colin Quinn, Amy Schumer, Tom Papa, Jim Norton, Jeff Ross, Burt Kreischer, Mark Maron, and Dave Chappelle. The lineup for the main show was revealed, including Colin Quinn, Bob Kelly, Mark Maron, Joe DeRosa, Jimmy Carr, Chris DiStefano, and Judah Friedlander.  Several callers phoned in, commenting on the previous day’s show or simply introducing themselves.

The main show detailed the hosts' previous night's exploits: a steak dinner, bar hopping, and encounters with Montreal street prostitutes, including a pregnant one and one who claimed to work at a morgue where racist makeup practices were allegedly used.  They narrowly avoided arrest for seemingly soliciting prostitutes.  Opie's $12,000 casino loss was recounted, alongside humorous stories about Roland's bathroom mishaps (twice locked in while defecating), his excessive latte consumption, and synchronized bowel movements with Eric.  Studio guests included Colin Quinn (following his keynote speech), with Amy Schumer and Tom Papa mentioned as dining companions.  Gary's sandwich reimbursement issue with the staff was also discussed, along with plans for a strip club visit.  A previous Opie pilot featuring a chimpanzee was mentioned.  Colin Quinn's keynote speech, near-casting for an Austin Powers film, and interactions with other comedians and Lawrence Fishburne were discussed, alongside Bobby Kelly's memorable hotel room defecation.

The show then segued into a series of loosely connected anecdotes and a spontaneous “dating game” with audience members Katerina and Kelly.  Sexually explicit personal experiences were shared, including one host's bathroom encounter and another's refusal of an unsolicited blowjob resulting in a potential lawsuit from Sandy King.  Discussions included paid sexual encounters.  The “dating game” featured crude, sexually suggestive questions posed to the women, who responded openly. Colin Quinn and Christy Stefano were mentioned as present; Stefano discussed a past violent incident.  Mark Maron joined, discussing his upcoming marriage.

A caller, Colin, detailed his wedding planning woes, including a previous marriage at a venue that became a strip club, and his attraction to women with "daddy issues."  Audience members Kelly and another woman shared experiences with troubled father-daughter relationships.  Jimmy was given the choice between two women for a date.  The discussion veered into impressions of female urination sounds, inappropriate jokes, and Ronkonkoma strip clubs.  Brad Williams, a comedian with dwarfism, joined, discussing appropriate terminology, audience reactions, and the dwarf community.  Judah Friedlander discussed Montreal's social dynamics and proposed a website to address comedy club payment interruptions.

The final segment featured Joe DeRosa recounting a disastrous Bar Mitzvah gig and his casino win-and-loss.  Brad Williams and Eric shared anecdotes.  Another highly improvised and sexually charged “dating game” with two female audience members ensued, focusing on pornography preferences, physical attributes, and sexual experiences.  One contestant chose Jimmy Norton for a lunch date.  The show ended with thanks to the audience and crew.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the tone was consistently vulgar and sexually charged, punctuated by frequent interruptions, off-color jokes, and insults.  Sam and Roland’s participation was limited in the final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Alright, here's what's going on.  The Opie and Anthony show today is the world's largest comedy festival.  Just for laughs, Montreal.  Coming up live this morning at 7 a.m. East.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Before Opie and Anthony.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah! Woo!  Listen to that crowd.  Look at that, the music's already faded out.  We were not prepared for a pre-show.  No, Montreal was not supposed to be the location.  My name's Sam Roberts, but you know that by now. 
[00:00:30]  And this is before, after Opie and Anthony.  I don't know, this is the after show, but we do it before the show.  We're live in Montreal at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival.  Now, usually, when we do a pre-show, we got, like, the audience full of people.  And it's meant to actually warm up the crowd.  You know what I mean?  It's meant, like, the audience comes in.  They go, oh, there's something going on.  Okay.  You get a little buzz going.  And then by the time Opie and Anthony and Jim come on, everybody's ready for a big show.  Maybe it's because they've had to sit through me for, like, half an hour, an hour. 
[00:01:00]  But I don't know.  This time, we're trying something different.  We're going to go ahead and start the pre-show without an audience altogether.  You at home will be listening.  But there's nobody in the room yet.  Eric Nagel is not here.  Let's go around the room, and I'm going to tell you who's here.  Travis is here in Montreal.  Gary is here in Montreal.  He's got his passport.  We learned that yesterday.  Roland is here.  But that's because his room is so uncomfortable that, of course, he's going to be here on time.  He's not sleeping because all he's got is a sofa bed, which we learned yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  For whatever reason, Roland, the master of getting the dick in the ass, showed up at the Hyatt yesterday, two days ago.  And they informed him that the only room they had for him was a room with no bed, just a sofa bed.  Since he's checked in, a little update, like people that got here yesterday have rooms with beds.  So that's something that's going on here at the Hyatt.  Troy's here, conspicuous by their absences, again, are Eric Nagel and Mark Zito. 
[00:02:00]  But those are the ones that are on a little more of the celebrity timeline.  So they'll be here when they get here.  And, of course, the audience will be trickling into this room as the show continues.  We're minutes away, several minutes, but minutes from Opie and Anthony starting day two of the big Montreal explosive comedy show.  And, I mean, I think yesterday's show, you know, everybody realized it was going to be a good show because you're packing the room full of comedians. 
[00:02:30]  I don't think anybody realized how great it would be.  I can't give Joe DeRosa credit for making the show a good show.  But the fact, I think the takeaway from yesterday's show, and this is one of the reasons why you have to catch these live shows, is Joe DeRosa and his infinite wisdom.  Like a lot of comedians, I was talking to Ant about this last night, a lot of comedians, they come in here and they look around the room, especially when there's a lot of people in here and they realize everybody's killers. 
[00:03:00]  Like all the comedians we had in here, Jesse Joyce, Bob Kelly, Chris DiStefano was here.  Of course, Joe DeRosa, John Mulaney was killing yesterday.  Tom Papa was here.  All these comedians are here.  And Joe DeRosa decides that instead of doing the normal thing, which is to look around the room, to take your shots, and to cover yourself at all times.  For instance, when Bob Kelly threw it towards Opie yesterday, he said, Opie, have you ever tasted your own cum? 
[00:03:30]  And Opie, with I think quite a revelation, said, yeah, I have.  What's it to you?  To basically move on, there's no story here, and made it so, all right, attention is going to be diverted from Opie.  Like most of the time, the people with experience here know that you have to divert attention away from you.  Joe DeRosa decided to take an opposite approach yesterday.  And without provocation, announced to the room full of comedians, killer comedians, that he wants to suck dick. 
[00:04:00]  I mean, he said that I've decided I want to find Bailey J, who's our transsexual, transvestite friend.  I don't know, she's a chick with a dick who's a friend of the show.  And he announced that without question, he wants to perform fellatio on her.  Then, as the show moved on, he wouldn't allow the topic to be changed.  He wanted to stay on the fact.  Eric Nagel has joined the show.  Eric Nagel is here.  He is in the building. 
[00:04:30]  He wouldn't allow the topic to change.  He instead brought it back to him wanting to perform fellatio on a man with titties every time he could.  And then, in an effort to prove that medically constructed vaginas could look like real vaginas, he started going through his people he's following on Twitter and talking about the transvestites that he's following.  Troy, you're here.  I don't know why. 
[00:05:00]  Did you understand the logic behind what Joe DeRosa did yesterday?  Honestly, I can't say that I think Joe has anything else interesting to say.  Is that what it is?  We know you've had your history with Joe.  You made it quite clear that that's been your stance on a long time.  So you think he comes in, I don't really have anything going on right now, so I'm just going to announce something humiliating?  Does he know this is going to be destructive for me?  I'm going to get beat up for this bad.  I think if he doesn't go down that road and he's just riffing with the other comedians, he won't get anything in. 
[00:05:30]  So it's better to have –  Or pull a Chris DiStefano.  Yeah.  It's better to have negative –  Attention.  Attention than – because he's not going to get any positive attention.  So he's like a little kid who wants attention and hasn't figured out the difference between the positive attention and the negative attention yet.  Right.  I don't know what it is.  And he knows that if he gets at least negative attention, somebody is paying attention to him. 
[00:06:00]  And he likes it.  And he likes it.  And I'm sure his Twitter followers are going to be like, who's this guy that wants to suck a cock?  Let me find out who it is.  But it's just like –  Oh, so he's kind of putting the word out there.  He's putting – he's trying to put the word out there that he's interested in women that have penises.  Right.  And he's interested in sucking their cocks.  Right.  And so he's hoping that a woman on Twitter with a penis will reach out to him and say, hey, I got a dick.  Yeah.  Nobody's sucking it at the moment.  If you know Joe DeRosa and you've listened to him on the show, the only thing he talks about is women with penises wanting to suck their dicks. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Now it's his shitty tattoo.  Right.  And it's kind of –  90s alternative rock.  And you're not going to get by talking about 90s rock.  Here.  I mean people are going to look at you like, you fucking idiot.  So what else is he going to talk about?  They talked about the two other things that he's only good for talking about.  Well, it's nice to know that your beef with Joe DeRosa is kind of settled and squashed.  I mean it's just –  You don't have any ill feelings anymore.  It's not ill feelings.  It's just an observation of truth.  I guess – I mean it's hard to argue.  Yeah.  Why would you come in and do it?  I mean can you tell me? 
[00:07:00]  And – but in Joe's credit yesterday, he did say something funny.  I couldn't remember what it was, but I did remember everybody laughed.  And you and I looked at each other.  Yeah.  And we acknowledged that finally – all the times that Joe's been on the show, he finally  said something funny.  He did have a funny joke yesterday.  And that's the thing.  This environment here breeds, I think, the best out of these comedians.  If anybody's listening back there, could I have some water?  We got – we started the show so early that the water had not arrived yet.  So I'd love to lubricate my throat if that's a possibility.  Wet the whistle.  Wet the whistle a little bit. 
[00:07:30]  But we're doing the show from the Just for Lives Comedy Festival in Montreal.  And for those that don't know, I mean it's insane how big this thing is.  It's not just full of fans of comedy, but every comedian you can think of is just here milling  about.  Thank you very much.  It's just here in this small little compacted area like you have no idea.  We got on the plane.  We told you yesterday.  This is my favorite part about being here is the people that are here, like all your favorite 
[00:08:00]  comedians are just walking around being like, yeah, I'm staying at this hotel too.  It's pretty amazing.  Mark Zito is here.  He decided to grace us with his presence.  Way to go, buddy.  So maybe we'll finally get an audience in here.  Sal, you're back there?  Yes.  No, he's not.  Yeah, you're there.  Are the phones on?  The phones should be up and running.  Yeah, people can call.  Can I solicit phone calls?  Of course you can, Sam.  All right, 866-WOW-1-WOW if you want to share your memories of yesterday's show or what 
[00:08:30]  you're expecting today or whatever.  But everybody that's here in Montreal.  So we told you, we get on the plane and Colin Quinn, the first class cabin of this tiny little  Air Canada plane includes Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Colin Quinn, Amy Schumer.  Roland had to wait at the airport and he ended up taking a flight with Tom Papa.  We got here.  I don't know if you remember Moshe Kasher.  He was on the after show, I guess, a few months ago at this point.  He's a very funny comic, but he's just sitting in the lobby of the hotel waiting for his elevator. 
[00:09:00]  I heard Dave Chappelle was hanging out a couple nights ago down at the hotel bar.  You know what I mean?  It's not like you're looking at these obscure spots in Montreal somewhere like, oh, I heard  some, they're hanging out at the hotel bar at any point in the day.  You don't know who you're going to run into.  We were, we went to dinner last night with the whole show went out and it was just like,  you know, it was Opie, Anthony and the show staff, all the comics were out doing their  thing and doing shows. 
[00:09:30]  But as we're sitting there and the night gets later and later, Amy Schumer, Tom Papa, Jim  Norton walk in to get a table.  Jeff Ross walks in.  We went back to the hotel afterwards and Burt Kreischer's there and Mark Maron's there  hanging out with him.  It's amazing.  And then you look at the lineup for today's show.  You thought yesterday's show, like today, every comedian is just destructive.  Who's coming in today?  Like every, Colin Quinn is finally coming in today. 
[00:10:00]  So Colin Quinn's going to be on the show.  Bob Kelly's coming back.  Mark Maron's going to be on the show today.  Joe DeRosa is coming back.  No.  Yeah.  Who said no?  Me, Sal.  That was you, Sal.  Jesus fucking Christ.  I don't even remember anything from yesterday except for Joe again, the same fucking tattoo  shit.  And he wants to suck a dick.  He did officially announce that.  Oh, I'm pretty sure I slated that.  Yeah.  Does that surprise you, Sal?  No.  Why would it?  Takes one to know one. 
[00:10:30]  Am I right?  No, it's just obvious how much he's fucking talking about that sort of thing all the time.  I mean, you know what?  That's true, too.  But yeah, Joe DeRosa is going to be here.  Jimmy Carr is going to be on the show.  He's never been on the show before.  He's a super funny comedian.  I'm really excited to see how Jimmy Carr does.  Chris DiStefano is coming back because Chris DiStefano was the guy who was on the show yesterday  and probably in the two hours that he was in here filled up about three minutes of airtime. 
[00:11:00]  He didn't have a lot to say.  And I understand that because, you know, he's a young comic.  A lot of you, if you watch anything on MTV, you've seen him because he's on Guy Code and Girl Code.  And they promo those shows 24 hours a day.  So he's on – that's what he's kind of blown up for.  And he was just on Letterman.  I was talking to Opie about him last night, and I'm like, you don't understand.  This guy that didn't say anything, he went on Letterman like two weeks ago and crushed. 
[00:11:30]  Chris DiStefano did.  It's online if you look for it, but he's coming back.  He's a funny dude.  Yeah.  I think he was just nervous trying to get in his chop, you know, his punches.  But I could see where he'd be nervous because he's doing Opie and Anthony, which is a notorious radio show.  It's not the after show.  He's been on the after show before, and he's been funny, but he's doing Opie and Anthony as a notorious radio show.  He's – all these comedians are surrounding him.  They've all been in the game significantly longer than he has.  So, you know, he doesn't want to say the wrong thing.  I think today Troy and me are going to have to sit down with him before he gets on the air and let him know you've got to be a shark in these waters. 
[00:12:00]  I'm going to let you know who your weak targets are.  You know, we'll tell him to sneak in an EMROC joke.  Yeah.  We'll tell him to sneak in, you know, take a shot at Joe DeRosa.  You know what I mean?  Like just the targets that kind of work for the show.  Yeah, the easy ones.  Right.  That's how you start.  Yeah.  That's how you get there.  And then eventually you can move on and build up your confidence that way.  But also Judah Freelander is going to be on the show as well.  Judah – it's been a while since he was on O&A.  But that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven big comedians. 
[00:12:30]  We just installed another row for the crowd.  And – and wait till you hear this.  I don't know if you were listening closely yesterday, but we were standing room only by the end of the show.  And some assholes just kept leaning up against the wall and turning the lights off in the middle of the show.  So we're going to – we've figured out the technology behind this.  We're going to affix what appears to be a plate to the wall, like a serving plate, like a dinner, like a small little – like a bread plate, maybe a butter plate even. 
[00:13:00]  And just affix it over the light switch.  Problem solved.  Let me see if the phones are working here.  We'll start the first caller on the pre-show.  Again, Opie and Anthony will start this thing live from Montreal in minutes.  And this is like the opposite.  You know how when O&A do like a massive show and then everybody leaves the room and they start the after show and it's just me by myself?  This is the opposite.  Like right now I'm just echoing off the walls. 
[00:13:30]  There's nothing going on in here.  But the crowd is going to start trickling in.  Yeah, start trickling the crowd in.  Comedians are going to be in here.  And this show – I'm predicting a better show than yesterday.  And yesterday's show was goddamn near perfect.  So Matt in Buffalo.  Prime time, Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  What's up, buddy?  Privileged to speak with you, man.  Just got to ask, is Travis's wife going to be on the show? 
[00:14:00]  I mean, she is from the great white north of Montreal and all that stuff.  Maybe we can get her input.  I mean, I know –  I would love to know.  That's a good question, Matt.  Because yesterday, you know, you talk about stars of the show and there was one moment that I think was a highlight for everybody.  It's when Uncle Paul made a disgusting, sickening, revolting, child pornography, pedophilia, angled joke. 
[00:14:30]  And there was the angelic laugh of a four-year-old girl coming from the back of the room as if to say, hey, the guy's right.  The guy is right.  The guy knows what he's talking about.  Travis, your wife is from Montreal.  She was here.  Her dad was here yesterday.  You guys brought your daughter into town.  She was very –  Adorable four-year-old daughter.  She really got a kick out of Uncle Paul.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, she knows good comedy when she hears it, you know? 
[00:15:00]  Was that a little –  She's been associated with the show for so long.  Is that it?  Yeah.  She just listens at home.  She's like, wow.  Well, she's met Uncle Paul like a dozen times at Anthony's house.  In fact, I don't even think she's met Jim.  No, she's – yeah, what's your – Uncle Paul.  Yeah, she doesn't know who Jim is.  But it's not a character.  It's not – like she thinks it's a man named Paul that's close enough to the family to be her uncle.  He just says funny things in a funny voice.  Like do you ever – do you ever think to sit her down and say, we don't laugh at that, sweetie?  No.  Like that's not – no.  No.  Does she know what she's laughing at? 
[00:15:30]  No idea.  Or is she just like, ah, they're shoving a mic in my face.  She just thinks it's great that everybody's laughing and having a good time.  She is.  Yeah.  She's –  Happy-go-lucky, right?  We went down to the pool.  What is your – is your wife okay with all this, with your daughter being exposed to the horrendous nature?  Yes.  She's fine.  Yeah.  Good.  I went down to the pool.  We're all good people.  Are we?  All of us?  Most of us.  I went down to the pool yesterday after the show.  Troy and I went down and we found some tight bathing suits to put on and did some tandem diving. 
[00:16:00]  But we got in and Roland joined us.  First of all, Roland's swimwear matches his streetwear 100%.  He comes in.  He's wearing the same T-shirt that he wore yesterday.  And you know it was the same T-shirt because his mustard stain from lunch was still on the shirt.  I think that's why he did it.  Because he wanted to clean himself off?  He wanted to wash himself off, yeah.  Well, it was his favorite Bruce T-shirt.  Yeah.  So he had to make sure that he got cleaned off.  But he gets in the pool in his Springsteen T-shirt and gym shorts, which is his uniform for work. 
[00:16:30]  It's his uniform for life.  And he can't swim.  Like, he can't swim at all.  He won't even – he won't go into the deep end.  Travis's daughter ended up coming down with Travis's wife and getting in the pool.  She's a stronger swimmer than Roland.  She's four years old.  Yeah.  She just had her floaties on her arm.  And she was fearless.  She was going down into the deep end.  She was grabbing floaties – you know, the flotation deals, the noodles, everything.  Roland wouldn't get past that blue painted line at the bottom of the pool.  He was fearful of it. 
[00:17:00]  He was – no, yeah.  He wouldn't even – like, we were making fun of him.  We were like, Roland, we're getting out of the pool now.  Kids go up the stairs.  We're going to go up the adult ladder.  The ladders are there for grownups.  The stairs are there for children, so they're okay with it.  And Roland goes, the stairs are there for me, too.  The stairs are there for me, too.  I'm not a swimmer.  I thought I told you this.  Keith in Connecticut.  Good morning, guys.  What's up, buddy?  I wanted to agree with Troy.  When Joe gets on the air, I can't run to the radio fast enough and shut up the fuck off. 
[00:17:30]  I hate him worse than I hated Danny.  And that's a real fucking – I hate both of them.  And he doesn't pay one – I wouldn't pay a fucking penny to go see him do comedy.  We can't just trash Joe DeRosa before he gets here.  I can.  Fuck him.  I guess you – I don't have control over you, Keith.  You're right.  But it's not a right thing.  He's going to be here.  I'll bet it'll be funny today.  And it's nothing that hasn't been told to him before.  I know, but he doesn't like it.  Why would he?  Then why does he keep doing it?  Why does he keep having to bring up that he wants to suck cock and bad tattoos and 90s alternative rock? 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  He came to a realization that he wants to have a penis in his mouth.  What can you do?  Keith, do we have an update on the night of Anthony Cumia?  Sam, this is my first time on the shit show, and I'm not wasting –  Give him a round of applause, everybody.  Give him a round of applause.  And I'm not wasting any of Mr. Cumia's good material on your fucking nonsense.  You know what that means. 
[00:18:30]  Mr. Cumia's got some good material.  Let's give Keith another round of applause.  But the fact that Keith is here makes me think that Anthony Cumia did go home last night.  So that's a plus.  That means he will be here at any point.  Who's here right now?  Anybody travel from a long distance?  What's long distance?  It's like –  Huh?  The U.S.  Did you travel from the U.S.?  New Hampshire.  New Hampshire.  How far away is New Hampshire?  I'm three hours away.  And what motivated you to come here?  Because you guys rock.  Is that it? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I like that.  Uh, is this a – did you plan this or is it spur of the moment?  Uh, it's kind of spur of the moment, but –  And you're here by yourself?  I did.  My guests did not make it.  Why not?  Short – I don't know.  Just not enough time, I guess.  I don't know.  So you had to drive like – did you just come in now?  Yeah.  So you had to leave like the middle of the night and just drive by yourself?  I got a life, man.  I can't just, you know, oh, go up to Montreal for the night and all that, so –  Yeah, but you're going up to Montreal for the morning.  What's the difference?  That's true, I guess, but –  What's your name?  Mark.  Mark?  It's nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you, man. 
[00:19:30]  I see some familiar faces.  See, that's the way to do it.  You got the guy with the beard.  Troy, did you hang out with this guy?  No.  No, he split after the show.  But he looks like a cool dude, you said.  Yeah, he looks like a cool dude.  How's it going, man?  Did you enjoy the show yesterday?  It's going great, Sam.  It was awesome yesterday.  Do you think – have you heard the comedians that are going to be on the show today?  Do you know who's going to be on?  So far, I've heard that Colin's on.  Yeah.  You guys want to know who's going to be on today?  I told the audience at home already, but Colin Quinn's going to be here.  Bob Kelly is coming back.  Joe DeRosa is coming back.  And yesterday, you know, like we discussed, he announced that he wants to suck dick. 
[00:20:00]  I don't know what he's got for the show today.  Mark Maron's going to be here.  Nice.  Jimmy Carr.  You guys know who Jimmy Carr is?  He's a big-time – I think he's British.  But he's a giant comedian.  He's got like 2 million Twitter followers or something like that.  He's hilarious.  Chris DiStefano is coming back.  And we're going to try to get him to talk this time because he's very funny.  And he's been on the after show before.  And Judah Friedlander will be on the show today.  Do you think, after witnessing yesterday's show, that today can live up to that? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  You do?  I think the crowd's going to be better today.  I do too.  I don't know if you counted the rows, but they added another row of people in here.  They did.  You feel closer to the action now?  I feel a lot closer to the action.  You were sitting with that hot girl yesterday.  Yes, I was.  Why didn't you bring her back?  Back where?  Here.  Why isn't she here now?  Well, she – I don't know.  They had to work the next day.  What?  That's what I said.  That's awful.  I have a bad feeling about the girls, though, today.  What's the bad feeling? 
[00:21:00]  Well, because there's one here.  Look at the ratio of guys to girls.  Yeah, but not yet.  There's another girl out there.  I'll bet – let's talk to the young lady.  Which one?  Her or her?  The one who's sitting down already, the blonde.  Hello, miss.  Hello.  How are you?  What brings you to Montreal?  Where are you from?  I am from Montreal.  And what's your name?  Amanda.  Now, are you Amanda – are you just here because you heard there was something going on in Montreal  and you thought you would stop by or is this an intentional trip?  My fiancé brought me.  Are you a fan of the show or he just listens?  He just listens.  And he made you come?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  I bet he did.  You get it?  He made you come.  You admitted it.  Yes, he did this morning.  You've had sex this morning already?  Oh, yeah.  That's fantastic.  Well, that's why he's like, look, I will bang you if you come – if you arrive at the show today.  Yeah, that's pretty much how it went.  Are you – did you just come from home, I guess, since you live here?  Yep.  How far away?  In LaSalle.  I don't know what that is.  I don't even know what LaSalle is.  It's about 30 minutes away.  I'm from New York.  I don't understand that.  Do you know about – do you listen to the O.B. and Anthony show? 
[00:22:00]  When he listens to it at home.  Yeah, so are you – do you know it's not generally – the audience is not overwhelmingly female.  Did you know that?  I heard yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  There was, like, one hot girl in here, and everybody just goes, who is that?  We have to talk to her.  So are you prepared for that type of – what's your fiancé's name?  Jamie.  Jamie.  Are you – do you know bringing your fiancé here that she's going to stick out like a sore thumb, right?  Pretty much, yeah.  Like, it's going to be noticed. 
[00:22:30]  Are you okay with that?  Yeah, there's no problem with that.  What can you do about it, right?  Not much.  How long have you been listening to the show for?  About three years.  That's very good.  Is there a big Canadian O&A audience?  Because we were – when we were first doing this, we weren't really sure if the audience thing was going to work.  We didn't know if we were going to be sitting up.  We – actually, that's every live gig we do, though.  We're like, I don't know if we have an audience there.  Maybe we should – we shouldn't even invite a live audience.  Then we do, and we fill up the room.  It's amazing how popular this show is. 
[00:23:00]  But we didn't know when we were doing Montreal whether or not we should even have an audience,  and we decided to throw some chairs in here, and now it's standing room only.  Do you guys know?  Is there a big O&A audience in Canada, or are you guys in?  You guys are in?  Well, it kind of seems like a secret thing.  It's like an underground of Canadians that listen to the show.  You know Americans listen to it, but just –  Not really Canadians.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I guess you'd say not really Canadians, but the room's almost half full, 
[00:23:30]  and it's like 6.30 in the morning.  I've been listening for nine years, so –  Wow.  So, yeah.  Nine years?  Have we even been on in Canada for nine years?  No, I listen to it through the internet kind of thing.  That's pretty amazing.  What's your name?  Derek.  Where are you from?  Ottawa.  Ottawa.  How far away is that?  Hour and a half.  Hour and a half.  Because I was getting some tweets last night saying, like, oh, we're waking up at this time,  and we're going to drive three hours.  Can you sneak us in?  I'm going, I'm not the door, man.  Like, I don't know what to tell you.  Hopefully, like, I'd like to see you, but I can't tell you. 
[00:24:00]  Were you on the list, or did you just figure you'd try to show up?  Well, yeah, I was just on Facebook.  I saw that they had the contest there, so I applied, got the email saying congratulations.  Came here at about, I don't know, maybe eight o'clock, and checked in the hotel.  Woke up at 540.  Oh, so you got a room here.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Some of these guys are just, like, would just show up.  Yeah, they just camp right out the building.  Yeah, I think that some people have just been hanging out in the lobby of this conference room.  Absolutely.  Yeah, catching Z's. 
[00:24:30]  All right, well, I hope you enjoy the show.  Who's the lovely lady behind him?  What's your name, miss?  Rachel.  Rachel, where are you from?  I'm originally from Alabama.  I'm in Calgary right now.  What made you move to Calgary?  My husband's Canadian.  So you were like, I gotta move to this great place where all these wonderful men are.  Yes.  Is that it?  He's originally from around here.  How far away is Calgary?  On a plane or driving?  I don't know.  It's a three and a half hour flight.  Like, if you had just, you could have said 15 minutes walking, and I wouldn't have known 
[00:25:00]  the difference.  I guess it's a three hour drive?  No.  Or flight?  It's a three and a half hour flight.  Oh, my God.  It's very far away.  So did you guys fly in?  Yes.  For this show or just for the festival?  For the festival in general.  Why wouldn't you say just for this show?  Just say.  I gotta tell the truth.  Just say literally, like, I found out about that they were gonna do a pre-show.  And I had to fly in just for the pre-show.  Do you live near Stu Hart's house?  Sorry?  No, no.  I'm sure you probably don't know about that.  Um, so are you a fan of the show or is it more you're, uh, the man you're with? 
[00:25:30]  Um, I listen to it, yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  But that doesn't make you a fan.  It's just on in the house.  I kind of dodged that question.  Who's the man that you're with?  My name is Ugg.  What?  That's, you're in Montreal.  There's bound to be some French names.  Ugg?  Ugg, yeah.  That's a real name?  That is.  I like it.  Six letters, four silent letters.  What are the letters?  H-U-G-U-E-S, but it's more like U-G-U.  H-U, that sounds like Hugh to me.  I don't know if I'm putting it.  Well, it is, but in French.  Ugg.  Um, all right, well.  See, you know, you just had a better, the first and second attempt that, than most people 
[00:26:00]  that I work with.  Well, I would, I don't blame them.  It's not a real name.  It doesn't sound like it.  What's, uh, what's your relationship with this lady?  I would be married for seven years now.  Oh, well, congratulations.  Let's give them a round of applause.  Um, you're a big fan of the show?  Yeah, since 2006.  Wow, and you make your wife listen?  Uh, yeah, when we take my car.  Yeah, yeah, so that, that's where she's heard the show.  Does she know?  Do you think, is she prepared for, like, what goes on here? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  She understands the humor?  Yeah, I, yeah.  She was listening yesterday at the airport when I was sitting over there.  Does she know she's going to be singled out?  Yeah.  Like, she knows that there'll be attention drawn to her?  Yeah, I told her.  What's it like, uh, for you guys, and I guess you don't know, maybe I'll have to ask you  after the show, who know that, like, you come here with your wife, you're a big fan of the  show, but you know that they're going to go right to you two and put you on the Pay No  Mind list.  Like, right, all they're going to be concentrating on is your wife.  Yeah.  You're okay with that?  I got to chat with him yesterday, so I'm ready to, you know. 
[00:27:00]  Who'd you get to chat with?  Anthony, mostly.  Oh.  He just kind of goes in the back.  Isn't it amazing?  Are you staying here?  Like, have you been here for a couple days?  Well, my family's from city, like, a couple hour drive from here, so I've been here all  week, but I drove back to Montreal here yesterday and driving back, so.  Because, you know, you're talking about chatting with the guys, and I was saying, I don't know  how many of you are in town for the festival and hanging out at the hotel and everything,  but it's amazing how many people you just see walking around. 
[00:27:30]  Like, all your favorite comedians, they're just walking around, like, chilling.  I walked right by you yesterday.  That's what I'm talking about.  People like me, Sam Robertson.  Well, I mean, I saw you and Jeremy Hots, so.  I don't know.  Who's Jeremy Hots?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Who's Sam Roberts, too?  That's the other question.  Well, you guys are the guys who were tweeting me this morning.  I appreciate the tweets.  Thanks for the help, by the way.  I appreciate it.  I'm not the door guy.  I'm hosting this show.  I'm not in without you.  Zito helped us.  Zito didn't help anybody.  He didn't even get here on time.  I was sitting there, like, in my head going, okay, what am I going to talk about on the 
[00:28:00]  pre-show tomorrow?  Like, going, and then I get tweets like, hey, could you let me in?  No.  Like, what?  It was seven hours.  Come on, man.  I don't care how far you drove.  I'm not the jack of all trades.  I'm here to do a pre-show.  Where are you from?  Toronto.  Are you?  So you drove seven hours, not sure if you'd even get in.  No, no.  We literally showed up to this hotel, just assumed it was the right one.  And we're like, the door guy downstairs, like, yeah, man, we're here to see O&A.  Like, I'm pretty sure they're here, right?  And he's like, yeah, floor four, soprano.  We're like, thanks, man.  We're supposed to be here.  So, like, see ya. 
[00:28:30]  Canadians are just a friendly people.  They're just helpful people.  They assume there couldn't be any wrongdoing.  No, no chance.  But you're just, like, going hotel to hotel.  O&A up here, eh?  Yeah.  We just pretended we knew they were here.  And he's like, yeah, man, go upstairs.  They send you up.  You weren't sure.  You must not have a lot going on.  How could you just, like, say, like, hey, you ought to drive seven hours and just see?  Nothing going on.  Nothing?  Nothing.  What do you do for a living?  Nothing.  How old are you?  24.  I do freelance work.  Well, 24 is still young.  You live at home with your folks?  Oh, yeah, bud.  How do they feel about that? 
[00:29:00]  Not too proud, not too happy.  And you're like, don't worry, mom.  You always told me to do something with my life.  Me and my bearded friend over here.  Yeah, he looks like a Chechenian terrorist, doesn't he?  A little bit.  A white Muslim?  Are going to drive seven hours to go watch O&A do their thing.  Oh, did you, and instead of, they're saying, oh, well, did you at least, like, think about  this in advance and do the responsible thing and get on the, no, no, no.  We don't even have a hotel.  I didn't do any of that.  No, we're going to sleep in a car, man.  This is poorly thought out.  Guerrilla style.  So you're not leaving today?  You're going to sleep in a car?  Oh, yeah, for sure.  What are you going to, are you going to stay up here for a couple days, or? 
[00:29:30]  We got some friends doing, like, some comedian friends are doing some shows, so they're  just going to hang out, shoot the shit.  Yeah, and then sleep in your car for a while?  Oh, yeah.  With this lovely gentleman.  Who's your date?  What's his name?  What's your name, man?  He's him.  He is.  There's a lot of body heat.  I had to force him out.  He literally had zero dollars.  Like, zero dollars.  I was like, I'll pay for gas, man.  Let's just try and get there.  So you're just sitting there mooching off your parents.  He's, he has zero dollars, like, nothing.  Not even Canadian.  American, Canadian, zero. 
[00:30:00]  Nothing.  Not one loony to his name.  So, yeah, he asked his dad for some money to buy clothes.  He didn't even tell him he was coming here.  He just said, yeah, I need some money to buy clothes.  He's 24 years old.  Yeah, I know.  Living the dream, man.  It is the dream.  Living the dream.  Did your dad give you money for clothes?  Yeah.  Was he resentful when he gave it to you?  He gave me 40 bucks.  He's like, he gave me 60 bucks.  He's like, that's 40, right?  And I was like, yeah, totally, man.  See ya, thanks.  Just robbing your parents.  I'm a bad person.  Yeah, did you go to college?  Yeah, I did.  I dropped out.  Oh, good. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, well, that worked out.  I'm just full of surprises, aren't I?  You figured you'd be certain.  College is not for you.  You're more along the lines of just staying at your parents' house for as long as humanly  possible.  Pretty much.  Smoking weed, playing video games.  Right.  And did you pitch that to your parents?  And you're like, look, guys, I know you want me to go to college, but there's weed to be  smoked, and there's all these video games coming out.  I can't do both.  Yeah.  Like NHL.  You know, I'm Canadian.  What am I going to do?  Right.  You've got to hold on me.  Every year, there's a new NHL game.  I don't have time for these classes.  There's one new one in two months.  What am I going to do?  What do you, what about, Mr. What's your name, the bearded guy?  Hey, man, I'm Dave. 
[00:31:00]  Job Podcasts don't make any money.  We make a little bit.  Not only, you're not even on the podcast, so you have to get money from the podcast that  don't make any money.  There's two degrees of no money.  It's just a lot of no money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do.  I make a little bit.  You do?  Yeah.  It's kind of a startup, but we have some shows coming on Sirius now, so.  Now, you have shows on Sirius Canada or Sirius?  Yeah, on Sirius Canada.  Canada Laughs and Canada Talks.  That's pretty great. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  So, is your method of business that you trick these people that think they're going to do  a podcast and stuff and you rent out studio time?  I just don't have a comment on that.  So, you try to get guys like this who live at home with their parents and are going to  ask their dad for clothes, but instead are going to pay you for studio time instead of  just buying like a mic that you can plug into a computer via USB and podcasting that way.  No, it's just, yeah.  Is this bad for business?  Okay.  People don't realize that the last thing you need to podcast is a studio?  Well, you should check out the Sam Roberts podcast, obviously. 
[00:32:00]  Look at this room.  This isn't even a studio and it's a professional broadcast with a professional broadcaster.  That's right.  That's right.  So, how much money can you make running a podcast studio?  I'm doing a live podcast tomorrow in Toronto.  I'm going to get $100 for that, so I'm pretty excited.  That's pretty sick.  Who's going to give it to you?  We're doing bands, so we're going to...  Oh, man, so you are just crushing dreams.  Not only are you taking money...  First, your first line of defense is finding people that want a podcast and taking their 
[00:32:30]  money, thinking that they have these dreams of becoming, you know, broadcasters.  Then you find bands that also are not going to make it and take their money.  You really...  The way you talk about it, it sounds like a Ponzi scheme.  It is a little bit.  Like, you're a bad person.  I didn't think so, but now I'm almost 100% sure.  But you're better than the dude you drove in here with.  He has no money.  He's just stealing money from his dad.  At least I have, you know, the podcast game.  How much money does he have?  Zero.  Zero dollars.  I've got about $35 to change off me right now. 
[00:33:00]  What happened to the 60?  Yeah, you've got to eat, man.  You've got to eat.  No, you don't.  You don't need to spend $25 on food.  It was a long drive.  All right.  It's seven hours.  I just spent $25 on food.  Look at us.  We're big guys.  You're a husky man.  Exactly.  But you fit in a lot better than that lady does here with the ONA audience.  Oh, yeah.  That's true, yeah.  So you're excited?  Oh, yeah.  You're happy you got in?  Hell, yeah, buddy.  Zito helped you out?  Did he ever.  More so than you, Sam.  More so than me.  Hell, yeah.  More so than me.  But you know what?  I'm giving you life lessons. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  And in the end, you're going to come away from this taking some of the things that I've told  you here to heart and bringing them with you wherever you go on your journeys  of life.  Well, yeah, we realize the piece of the shit we are now, so we've got to thank you for that.  And your buddy just learned he's a bad person, so where else are you going to find that?  Another lady.  Troy, are you feeling better about the ratio right now?  It's stepping in the right direction.  It's still way off.  Yeah, but we have, I mean, how many girls did we have in here yesterday?  Three?  Three girls, but we have three.  All right.  We already have as many, and we got a lot more empty seats so far.  It's still, I'm a little nervous about it. 
[00:34:00]  What's this lady's name?  I'm Kelly.  Hi.  Kelly, welcome to the show.  Thank you.  Are you excited?  Are you an ONA fan?  I am a huge ONA fan.  I'm very excited.  You see, girls, it's not all just women who have to listen because their husbands have  the radio on.  There are some, these other chicks, they're just like, oh yeah, I listen to the show sometimes.  And you can tell it's because.  I'm very excited to be here.  Who are you most excited to see?  I'm excited to see you guys.  Like, I'm excited to see everybody.  Me, specifically.  You, Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  That's very flattering.  I appreciate you saying that. 
[00:34:30]  Do you have a favorite member of the Opie and Anthony show?  Or you just love the show?  I'm not, I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say a word.  I just want to see everybody.  Because you don't want to hurt any feelings.  I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.  I just got here.  You're a nice person.  I'm like this piece of shit Dave that we just talked to.  You're a nice human being with feelings.  When did you start listening?  I think when I got my car, so 07.  And what do you like about the show?  What do I like about the show?  That's what I asked you.  Well, I listen to it on my way to work in the morning, so I laugh on my way to work. 
[00:35:00]  I think that's the trick to this show.  It's like, you're on your way to work, and whatever's playing in the car is going to be  better than work.  That's true.  So it's like, it makes you think it's even better, because you're not at work.  That's true.  You know?  So what are you excited?  Did you hear the comedians are coming in today?  No, I haven't.  I haven't.  You want me to tell you?  Yes, please.  All right.  Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa are both coming back.  Yep.  Very exciting.  Yep.  Colin Quinn's going to be here.  Good.  Mark Maron's going to be here.  Good.  Jimmy Carr's going to be here.  Good.  Christy Stefano's coming back. 
[00:35:30]  Good.  And Judah Friedlander.  Nice.  Very exciting.  Nice.  You have a favorite comedian here at the festival?  You have a favorite comedian in general, or you just don't take stances?  My favorite comedian, I went to see Amy Schumer the other night.  She was awesome, of course.  Of course.  Of course.  Always kills.  Yep.  And is this your husband you're here with, or boyfriend?  Yep.  Oh, that dude's not with you?  You came alone?  Yes.  That's dangerous.  It's going to be like sharks swimming around her.  Yeah, already.  Like, not even.  That's okay.  The show's not even here yet.  It's the guys around in the audience. 
[00:36:00]  They're just looking over at her.  She should probably sit here.  No, I think that would be a very bad idea.  I'm good in the back.  You can't hide back there, just so you know.  It's scary.  Well, what do you do for a living?  I'm an accountant.  An accountant?  Yes.  That sounds boring.  Yes, it is.  That's why.  Where in Canada are you from?  Toronto.  Oh, and that's pretty far away.  Okay.  Not really.  How long's the drive?  I flew.  Like an hour flight.  Excuse me.  You don't have, not like, not like these slums. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, ask these guys.  Was flying an option for you guys?  Uh, for $60 flights, yeah.  Right.  Because, because, because you had the $60 from your dad.  And you had the money you just stole from poor podcasters.  Yeah.  You guys are a couple of bums.  Let me talk to Eric in Virginia.  Hey, Sammy.  Can you guys hear the callers?  Great.  Go ahead, Eric.  So, the burning question on everyone's mind, I think, is, since you all went out to dinner 
[00:37:00]  last night, did E-Rock fly solo again, or was he actually social with the people from  the show who make his life a living hell on a daily basis?  That's a great question.  Eric was very social last night.  He was at the dinner.  We were all there, but Eric did, well, not all of us.  Zito didn't make it, but he didn't quite make the cut.  He's not really part of the show, though.  No, he's not.  And, uh, Opie actually at one point during the dinner questioned, who is Mark Zito?  Which probably would hurt his feelings if he heard that.  But, yeah, Eric was very social last night. 
[00:37:30]  We all had a lot of fun, uh, at a steakhouse.  I don't remember what the steakhouse was called.  There were some bathroom issues, I believe.  Well, yeah.  With Roland and E-Rock.  I think Roland said he got locked in the bathroom and they had to come let him out.  Where is he?  Is Roland here?  Where are you?  Is Roland back there, or is he?  Somewhere.  No.  Roland!  He's actually sitting down eating.  Of course he is.  Roland, did you get locked in the bathroom last night?  Well.  Ladies and gentlemen, Roland! 
[00:38:00]  Well, I locked the bathroom door as you do when you go poo-poo.  Is that what you did?  Yeah.  And is that the French word for it?  Is that what you're working on?  And I said, let poo-poo.  Okay.  And I tried to...  I love the maturity of this audience.  That got a laugh.  Let poo-poo.  And I tried to open the door and it would not open.  It would not open.  You've done nothing but be humiliated here in Canada.  And then the maitre d' heard the noise.  He goes, what's going on?  I go, I'm stuck.  And he went, ugh.  And he kicked the door twice and opened it. 
[00:38:30]  I'm like, thank you.  You got yourself stuck in a cell.  I had to take another ship.  I had to wait for it here because I was afraid I would get stuck again.  So you go to the steakhouse.  You get stuck.  You go to the hotel.  You end up with a sofa bed.  Yeah.  You go to the airport.  They're not letting you on the plane.  Correct.  Have you gotten dicks in the ass anywhere else?  So far, I think.  Well, yeah.  You get in the pool and Travis's four-year-old daughter out swims you.  Well, she had floaties on, to be fair.  To be fair, she's a four-year-old girl. 
[00:39:00]  Well, Roland, you've got a hell of a lineup here for us today.  I did a splasher, though.  You did.  Yeah, well, she's four.  Yes, you beat her in a splashing contest.  That's right.  Roland and this four-year-old are in a splashing contest.  And Roland's going full force at her because he has to win.  Like, the little girl is splashing him in, like, little driplets of water getting on Roland's cheeks.  Roland comes over with his, what is a tidal wave to this four-year-old person?  Waves going over her head.  And then Roland goes, yay, I win. 
[00:39:30]  You proud of yourself?  A little bit, yeah.  You are.  All right.  Well, thank you very much, Roland.  You're welcome.  I want to talk to this other girl that just walked in.  I see you.  You.  Right over there, Troy.  Troy, you're feeling good about the ratio now.  It's getting better.  We're stepping in the right direction.  Stepping in the right direction.  What's wrong?  I just woke up.  Well, yeah.  Well, so did I.  And I got to do a whole show.  You got to talk to me.  If you're not going to talk to me, what am I going to do here?  Hello.  What's your name?  DeKaterina.  DeKaterina.  DeKaterina.  DeKaterina.  Yeah.  Where are you from? 
[00:40:00]  I'm originally from Saskatchewan.  Mm-hmm.  But I live in Montreal.  Okay.  So you're from here.  So you didn't have to drive.  Like, these idiots drove seven hours without even being on a list.  That's dedication.  Yeah, but he doesn't have any money.  He stole $60 from his dad.  They're not good people.  That's rock and roll.  I guess it's not really rock and roll because he's not in a band.  He's not doing anything.  Like, to be rock and roll, you got to be doing something.  Like, at least staying out late or doing something cool.  They're doing nothing.  But I embrace it.  I like you.  I like that you guys own it.  You guys are probably my favorite people here. 
[00:40:30]  So tell me, are you here with, is this man you're with?  Is he your husband, your boyfriend, or?  We're friends.  Just friends.  Yes.  So are you a fan of the show?  Unfortunately, this is the first time I'm hearing your show.  You've never heard the Opie and Anthony show before.  I know.  I was really hoping he wouldn't talk to me.  So then you probably won't understand this at all.  Nate in Philly.  Hey, Roland, how much water is left in the...  I hate callers.  He's just supposed to say slobbo. 
[00:41:00]  Eric, the people...  Like, this is why you can't stand these people.  Because they're supposed to...  They can't even make fun of you, right?  Eric Nagel, everybody.  That's the sex bagel himself.  E-Rock.  He's been alive.  So you've never...  You've never heard...  What did you say?  I said I feel really bad.  I'm sorry.  Why do you feel bad?  I don't know.  I mean, if anything, like...  I mean, we are all in the same camp.  You're the one who's being singled out.  I should feel bad.  I don't, but...  So you've never heard the show before?  Nope.  Are you...  What brought you here? 
[00:41:30]  Your buddy is just like, hey, come check out this...  My friend Alex is a really big fan.  Are you a fan of comedy?  Myself?  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  Who are some of your favorite comedians?  I don't know.  I don't know.  So you're not really that big.  No, I really...  Conceptually, you're a fan of comedy.  Sure.  The idea of somebody making you laugh is a good thing.  I don't know.  I like Hal Williams.  I don't...  Okay.  Before he went crazy.  Hal Williams won't be here, unfortunately.  That sucks.  You like Colin Quinn?  Sure, yeah.  That doesn't sound convincing.  The guy from SNL?  Yes.  Colin Quinn, the guy from SNL. 
[00:42:00]  He'll be here.  Cool.  You may get talked to on the main show, too.  If you look around, there's literally three times as many girls here as there were yesterday.  Awesome.  And there's not a lot of girls here.  I see one in the back there.  Yeah, I mean, there are other girls here.  I said not a lot.  Not you're the only one.  And she's also...  That's not her dude.  Exactly.  You came...  Are you...  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  Oh, boy.  Well...  She's in for trouble.  Enjoy the show, lady.  I appreciate you being here. 
[00:42:30]  Should have a lot of fun.  Where is Eric?  Bring him out here.  People want to hear from Eric Nagel before we hand the reins over to Opie and Anthony.  Are Opie and Anthony here, Eric?  Just talking to Opie in the back.  No, I said Opie and Anthony.  Anthony's not here yet.  Okay, that's the question.  That's the question, because we were talking earlier.  Casinos was open last night.  Yes.  And Anthony made a trip over there.  As soon as we were done with dinner.  After we were done with dinner. 
[00:43:00]  But he said he wasn't going to stay long.  And he's a man of his word, right?  Or no, not at all.  It depends on how big a role he was on.  Uh-huh.  Or how much he lost.  He said yesterday he was just going to check out the tables.  That's a lie.  That's a lie.  Okay.  No.  That's good to know.  Are you happy?  Do you think the show's gone well so far?  This one?  No, no, no.  Not at all.  I'm not going to ask you that question.  These guys saved me, I think.  These are the schlubs that came in for seven hours with nothing going on.  I like how some of the audience came back from yesterday.  Well, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  They found out there was a pre-show.  They're leaving after my part.  Oh, you're kicking them out?  No, no, no, no, no.  This is all they're here for.  Oh.  Like this excitement.  But you think yesterday's show went well?  Yesterday's show was great.  I mean, you're a guy who knows the show inside and out.  You think yesterday's show was great?  Do you think today's show could beat it?  With the lineup?  I think it could, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  What did you think of Joe DeRosa's revelations yesterday?  All right.  Hold on.  I saw him last night.  Yeah.  When we all split up.  I came back to the hotel. 
[00:44:00]  They had the big bar that's in the center of the hotel here.  Oh, I thought he was on a big bar.  It's an open bar, so all the comics and industry people are here.  Yeah.  And just out of luck, I run into Joe.  He comes over.  Hey, E-Rock.  And he's doing this little half dance thing, right?  What?  He puts his arm around.  Because he's hammered.  Okay.  All right.  And he puts his arm.  How are you doing?  Today's show, blah, blah, blah.  And then he's just holding my arm like this.  And he's looking around, just kind of bobbing his head. 
[00:44:30]  And he goes, there's so much stank in this room.  And I'm just sitting there like, you are such a mo.  He really is.  Because he called girls stank?  Is that what he said?  Yeah.  He's like, so much stank.  But he did the hand thing.  Because he has his right arm on my shoulder like this.  With his left hand, it's almost like a rap move.  He just goes, so much stank in this room.  Miss, who's never, you don't have to have a mic, but Miss, who's never heard the show before,  if somebody referred to you as stank, would you consider that like, yeah, this is a guy 
[00:45:00]  I might go home with?  Sure.  You would?  Possibly.  All right.  Well, maybe you will.  It depends what follows that.  Nothing.  Joe doesn't have any money.  No, yeah.  He's like this guy over there.  He has a Nintendo DS.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Travis, you gave me your phone.  You're getting a call.  Travis gave me the timer.  You're getting a call from Chris.  Well, so you're excited about today's show?  Yeah.  You were social last night.  Did you have a good time at dinner?  Dinner was great. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  You got to the best story too early about Roland getting locked in the bathroom while he was  taking a shit.  I didn't even know that happened.  That was news to me here.  Yeah, it was funny because he went twice.  The first time is when he got locked in there and that one of the staff members, because he's  shaking and like hitting the door and it's not opening, they had to come in there and  kind of like ram into the door just to get him out of the toilet.  How angry must Roland's body get at him?  Oh, it hates him.  You know what I mean?  He hates him.  Just the things and the amounts that he puts in there. 
[00:46:00]  Half the time, it doesn't even digest.  He'll just eat the steak and then it goes, oh my God, I got to go shit and he runs off.  There's a filet mignon sitting there in the toilet.  Well, Roland lived it up too.  I mean, we had a great meal, but Roland was really treating himself.  Of course he was.  I mean, Roland treats himself no matter what food establishment he's at.  I don't know, but he found something up here in Montreal that he loves.  Whatever they're doing to lattes up here, he loved.  He had five of them. 
[00:46:30]  He's like, I love the lattes here.  Yesterday, he's like, we went to that sandwich place, Schwartz, and he's like pouring vinegar  and like everything.  Mustard.  Yeah, everything.  And everything.  He's sopping it up.  He's going crazy.  You live it up, Roland.  And Eric was really excited because they were both shitting in sync with each other.  Yeah.  You were shitting together?  Our periods lined up.  But you got out of your stall.  That's true.  Your cycle, your shitting cycles lined up.  I went first, and then Roland went in, and that's when Roland got stuck.  Listen, if you thought this whole thing was amazing.  I didn't. 
[00:47:00]  Wait.  Well, I'm not asking you.  I'm talking to the audience.  Oh, sorry.  Wait until you hear what we have in store for you next.  Because coming up, it's day two of the Opie and Anthony show, live from Just for Laughs in Montreal.  You guys ready?  You guys excited?  We'll see you in a few minutes when the Opie and Anthony show officially begins.  More of the Opie and Anthony show.  More of the Opie and Anthony show.  Live from Just for Laughs in Montreal.  Coming up next. 
[00:47:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you. 
[00:48:00]  Thank you. 
[00:48:30]  Thank you. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you. 
[00:50:00]  Thank you. 
[00:50:30]  Thank you. 
[00:51:00]  Thank you. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you. 
[00:52:00]  Thank you.  Yay.  Oh, look at that.  Day two for Montreal, the Just for Laughs festival.  Another, another lousy day.  Good morning, everyone.  I hope we can keep our energy up. 
[00:52:30]  I'm a little...  Can you keep it up?  From yesterday.  I have to get it.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Yesterday, we had a lot of energy and a great radio show.  Oh, my God.  I know I'm a little banged up.  I know I'm a little banged up, and I'm sure you're a little banged up.  I know I'm a little banged up, and I'm sure you're a little banged up.  Just a bit.  We went out for steak dinner.  Yes.  And I said to myself, you know what?  I don't really...  I don't think I'm going to drink.  Yeah.  And then that fucking waiter just kept pouring wine like it was water.  Yes, he did.  So I'm...  It was...  So I'm kind of hurting a little bit. 
[00:53:00]  It was pretty good.  Which is rare for me.  I know the...  I woke up in a panic, looked at the clock, and it was about 6.40.  Really?  Like, I think 20 minutes or so, there's a show to do.  And I think I'm a part of that.  Yeah.  I better get up and get over there.  I don't think I could pull off the sick day.  Not all the way up here, just call up, yeah, just, I don't know, something I ate.  Food poisoning.  Something I ate at the casino at 2 a.m.  A tequila worm. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  I took a nice coleslaw shit, though, and I feel way better.  Fuck.  Already?  The coleslaw at that fucking place was awesome.  It was really good.  And I don't...  I mean, who eats coleslaw?  Who talks about it?  But it was so good.  It went right through me, though.  Yeah.  Well, I had some grilled asparagus, so I woke up, took a piss, and was like, ah!  What is that?  It's like fucking potpourri coming out of your pecker.  It's funny, guys, but I had a filet mignon light on the butter. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, it was really an enchanting evening.  Then we walked home, and, well, I almost got arrested for talking to hookers.  And it wasn't like when Jimmy talks to hookers.  You mean they were actually women?  We walked all the way home from the restaurant, and when you get back to St. Catherine, you know, the whole Just for Laughs festival is happening.  And at the end of the Just for Laughs, it gets really fucking seedy. 
[00:54:30]  And me, Chris, and who else was there?  And Billy Mac.  We decided to talk to some of the horrendous hookers.  Not because we were looking for anything.  Well, you've got to watch what you say.  Well, yeah, but then a homeless guy came around with a hat, so I started taking money out, and there were cops around.  Oh, yeah.  It looked like you were.  And Chris goes, man, if he pulls, Billy, you want to talk on Mike?  Yeah, look at Billy Mac.  Because Billy could explain it better.  And then they're scared if I pull out another dollar, we're going to get arrested because now we're showing cash. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  Exactly.  You're conducting a transaction in their eyes anyway.  A transaction.  Chris and I were trying to, like, keep your hands in your pocket, man.  Yeah, because I like talking to street people, which is fucking a weird little hobby I have.  And they were horrendous looking.  They were ugly.  And they were trying to get me and Billy Mac for a two-for-one special, 40 bucks each.  Yeah, it was about 40 bucks.  40 bucks each for a two-to-one special.  All right.  Not a hint of a body on them. 
[00:55:30]  No teeth.  The one was pregnant.  The one was pregnant.  Oh, so you're getting, like, two-for-one.  Yeah.  Oh, that was the two-for-one special.  That was the two-for-one special.  The fucking fetus.  Right.  Wonderful.  I go to the one that was pregnant.  I go, what's your deal?  She goes, I need fucking money.  I need to pay my fucking bills.  For sexual intercourse.  Yeah, she said that, Tim.  For sexual intercourse.  And we're having a good time just talking to them.  And then all of a sudden, we noticed there's three cops.  They just finished their meal.  And they're right outside. 
[00:56:00]  What was it?  Like a peep show or something?  Yeah, actually it was.  Yeah.  It was a peep show.  All the best parts of town you guys gone to.  It was awesome.  And they're telling us it's, like, the old 42nd Street.  Ooh.  And I was asking Billy, because, you know, he's on the job.  I'm like, I don't understand.  Like, the cops are eating.  And the hookers are right outside where they're eating.  And they just allow it to happen.  Yeah.  Which is strange to me, because in New York, they have shut everything down.  Yeah.  She was speaking, obviously, French.  And we didn't know what she was saying. 
[00:56:30]  So she could have been saying, hey, officer, these three guys are, like.  Right, right.  Trying to get hooked up.  And then it was screwed.  It was obvious we had to move on, because the cops were looking at us like.  Greg Opie-Hughes in Locked Up a Frog.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Oh, God.  And then I was just pulling money out for a homeless gentleman.  That made you nervous, right, Billy?  When I started pulling the money out for the homeless guy?  Well, yeah, because they don't know what you're going to pay for.  You were giving the guy, like, a couple bucks for his travels over the United States.  He was an overland fuck driver.  I think he's a musician or something.  I think he's full of shit. 
[00:57:00]  Of course, of course.  That's where I'm getting at.  I'll bet he had a problem with drugs.  Oh, you think so, Jimmy?  I do.  Literal, Jim.  But the cops started moving in closer and closer, because they're like, all right, there's  nothing going on here, but we, you know, you're making us look like assholes.  And then we're filming a movie, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It was an actual movie set.  Wow.  Yeah, it was a little weird.  So they weren't actors, real hookers?  No.  Oh, hell no, man.  Pregnant and toothless.  That's wonderful.  $40.  And then some black broad who's saying her daughter is going to be some big R&B sensation, 
[00:57:30]  but I'm not allowed to say her name, because then you know that her mommy's a hooker on  the side.  She goes, don't tell my family I'm down here.  They don't know this.  Oh, no.  But then did she give you a hint by opening an umbrella, Ella?  Oh, I got her name on YouTube, but now I can't fucking play it.  Didn't she work in the morgue?  Wasn't she a body washer or something?  Yeah, she was trying to tell me that one of her jobs, she works on a lot of things.  She works in the morgue, and I guess the morgue people are racist, because she said that  for many, many years, they would put, like, white makeup on dead black people's faces. 
[00:58:00]  Is that like a final joke?  Why would they do that?  She wouldn't explain, but she's saying that's why I'm proud that I work at the morgue,  because I've been able to change some things.  What?  What was her change?  I don't...  We didn't understand.  But mirror on the white face, Sam.  Right.  It's Al Jolson, Sam.  She says she cleans out their noses and their mouths, and it was disgusting. 
[00:58:30]  Boy, you really know who to hang out with.  Absolutely.  Jesus.  Because then we're walking the festival, and it was just a bunch of fucking boring assholes,  right?  Yeah, no, it was pretty boring, actually.  Yeah, so...  Wait, were you...  Where were you?  Because they used to do the nasty show in a place called Club Soda.  Is that where you...  Yes!  Right?  The reason we stopped there was because it said Club Soda, so we wanted to take a picture,  and then we...  That's my place.  Right.  And then we saw the girls hanging outside Club Soda.  Well, if you could call them.  They were horrendous.  Yeah, and behind the club. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah, sure.  And then we're like, all right, fuck it.  Let's go talk to these people.  Yeah.  I've been in that peep show next door.  I know exactly where that is.  Of course you...  It's creepy, though.  It wasn't even...  I couldn't even get one off.  That's the one.  They have the booth.  Yeah, it was awful.  It was awful.  Yeah, those hookers are terrible.  There's a little park right behind it, like a little hangout area.  We didn't wander.  We were right out front, and that was it.  We didn't go too far back.  I was trying to get them on film, and they would not cooperate.  That was my whole goal.  Now, why aren't you fessing up with who the woman was?  Which woman?  The one with the R&B singer. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, because she doesn't know her mom's a hooker.  I just fucked it up.  How great would that be to tell her?  Let's see.  But why would...  Well, I don't know from...  I don't know officially if she's a hooker.  I mean, she's in that area.  She did tell me, don't tell my family I'm down here.  They don't know that.  So, are you going to actually adhere to that?  I don't know.  Yeah, sure.  Take it to the grave.  Believe it's not as...  And then have blackface put on me.  Yeah.  She'll be okay once she finds out.  It was hard for me to adjust, but, you know, you get used to it.  She's my mother.  I'll try to find it. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, find out who that is.  I'm sorry.  Fess up.  Really?  Yeah, why not?  Oh, man.  You could be like the TMZ guy.  This is her right here.  Who's that?  This is her right here.  The mother?  No, this is the broad.  Are you sure the mother's a hooker, or are you just saying she...  I don't know.  She's in the area.  She was in the area of hookers.  Right.  I don't know what she was doing down there.  So, boy, what's this download costing you?  Decove, you already know.  Come go with me, and I'll show you all of all of the stores that you need to be in. 
[01:00:30]  Don't bring no friends.  It's just you and me.  Should we know her?  No.  Oh, okay.  She's going to be Montreal's next singing sensation.  Oh, we'll look forward to that.  That's what the mom said.  This sucks.  Terrible.  The whole break sucks.  I'm just telling you what I did last night.  No, I mean that.  All right.  It's a little monotonous.  She wrote it, too.  Well, you know, one of her friends might hear her on the radio and say, you know, you sing, 
[01:01:00]  and she'd go, yeah, and they'd go, well, I got good news and bad news.  Right, right.  They played your song.  You were on the radio, finally.  On an international radio show.  Yes, and that wasn't bleach on your mom's collar.  Her mom was very nice.  It was just a weird little, I don't know, I can't, it was strange.  What time did you get back to the mothership?  Not late.  Like 11, 11.30, somewhere around there.  No, that ain't bad.  I didn't see you leave.  I came in while you guys were at the table. 
[01:01:30]  Yes, you came in with the lovely and talented Amy Schumer and Tom Papa.  Yeah.  You dined with them.  Tom Papa walks around like he's a Hollywood star now.  I've never seen such a mediocre man walk around with such confidence.  He's wearing, like, Hollywood clothes now.  And he's, oh, do you notice that?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's the worst.  This dumb jack.  Ever since he did the Liberace roll, he's wearing 70.  Every night at the cellar, we've been attacking him physically.  Okay.  Walks in with these stupid patterned shirts.  Like, hey, I can get away with it. 
[01:02:00]  He's like, no, you can't.  He's a big star now.  Yeah, he's a zilch.  That was a great dinner.  It was wonderful.  And Anthony picked up the check, which is.  Well, you know.  You hear that, Gary?  Anthony picked up the check.  I could just write it off.  I write that off.  That was nice.  Whatever that means.  Write it off.  I'm getting at something, though.  You picked up a huge check last night for dinner without even thinking about it.  You're probably not even going to even fucking give it to the company.  Give me a bag of shells.  Gary made the staff pay for their sandwiches yesterday. 
[01:02:30]  Oh.  See, people talk, Gary.  Oh.  Could you get a mic and explain why you made our staff pay for sandwiches?  How much was it?  It must have been very expensive if he made them pay.  Gary, we had an amazing radio show yesterday.  And then I guess Gary, I don't know who wants to talk, but a lot of individuals talk to me.  And Gary brought everyone to lunch, right?  We all went to lunch.  I didn't bring everybody to lunch.  This is like testimony.  I love it.  We all went to lunch.  Sam?  Not necessarily. 
[01:03:00]  Sam, what can you add to that?  When you say, I don't know who wants to talk, but individuals came to me and you're looking at me and Gary's in the room, it kind of defeats the anonymity.  But you love it, so.  I don't mind it.  Tell me what you know.  Well, I mean, I know that the four of us, or six?  I think there were six.  Six people went to have sandwiches at Schwartz's.  Right.  And six people paid for their sandwiches.  They might not have been staff people, though. 
[01:03:30]  The company's not supposed to pick up just random people's lunch.  I think it was me.  You're staff.  They had a hat.  Troy.  He's staff.  Gary, obviously.  He shouldn't be staff, but he is.  Okay.  Staff infection.  Right, right.  Roland.  Yeah.  Roland's staff.  Who else was there?  Iraq.  Oh, wow.  That's eight sandwiches right there.  And, well, Mark Zito.  Who?  He's a guy.  He works outside. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, well, he should have paid.  Zito?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then I guess they had to get individual bills for their sandwiches.  Oh.  Gary, what are you doing?  Gary.  How much could a sandwich be?  It was $13.  $7, yeah.  $13.  So why wouldn't the company just pick up the lunch?  Everybody's getting reimbursed.  Oh.  No, it's not coming out of anybody's pocket.  Oh.  But why wouldn't you just go, hey, man, I got all the sandwiches, and I'll figure it out with the guys.  It was cash only, and I paid for both cabs.  So I was out of cash at that point.  Oh, good excuse. 
[01:04:30]  But the company, they can write, they can actually write that off, though?  No, they get paid back.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In, like, 18 months, you'll get that money back.  It just doesn't look good that the staff has to pay for their sandwiches and hope that they get the money back, what, three months later?  I'm sorry.  People in the back seem to think that we have a fucking steel wall here.  Can you tell them this is not the War Games door?  This is a curtain?  Who's blabbing?  Who's back there?  Who's blabbing?  Oh.  Who's back there?  It's your breakfast. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, thank you.  Oh.  Sorry about that.  Yes, please continue talking.  Yeah, I don't want them spitting in our breakfast.  Carry on, do whatever you like.  Oh, so he didn't have any cash on hand.  Yeah, we went to the ATM.  Left.  Ask to mouth.  Troy Kwan?  Anything to add?  No, there was an ATM right across the street.  Were you kind of bummed you had to pay for your own sandwich?  I mean, I'm used to it at this point.  It's the principle of it, though, right?  Yeah, it would have been nice.  Even if you get it back eventually, it's the principle.  It's sort of expected at this point.  Really?  To be treated like shit?  It's not treated like shit. 
[01:05:30]  It was just, you know, it's fine.  You're like shaking up the cage, don't you?  I love it.  Well, that was...  Well, we do appreciate Anthony picking up the bill last night because we had a great steak dinner.  Yeah, it was nice.  What are you going to do?  It was good.  And then, like, the glasses of wine were going down quite easily.  I thought I'd have, like, maybe a glass or two, but that guy kept pouring it.  And you picked a good one.  Yeah.  What was that?  A nice...  Syreau.  Syreau.  Blah. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Then I decided it was a great idea after dinner.  To go to the casino.  Well, it wasn't that late.  What time was it when I saw you leave?  What time was it?  About midnight.  Almost midnight.  Holy fuck.  You left at midnight to go to the casino?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  I wanted to play some cards. 
[01:06:30]  How did that work out?  Well, great.  Yeah.  And then pad.  Per use.  Yeah.  And whoever says they don't serve drinks at the tables was full of shit.  They just kept bringing the captains and Cokes.  Our listeners are full of shit.  They give us wrong information all the time.  Yeah.  Here's the phone call.  It's like, oh, you know, they don't serve drinks at the tables.  And then the next guy calls.  The last caller was full of shit. 
[01:07:00]  That's every call we ever get on any subject.  Apparently, everybody is full of shit.  So I went to the casino.  We sat down.  Keith, the cop, of course, joining me to take the abuse of every loss that I have.  And I started out with two Gs.  Nice.  I figured two Gs is a good starting point.  Two Canadian Gs or two American Gs?  The exchange is pretty even.  It was even? 
[01:07:30]  And I guess American money is just a little more than Canadian money at this point.  So if you make change at the table, they just do it at the Canadian rate.  So they win right off the bat.  They win immediately.  So I was working it.  I was working that two grand.  And, you know, I'm betting like first just betting.  It was a $50 minimum table.  So I'm betting some 50s and kind of getting the stack up a little.  And then I just start betting some hundreds.  And then, wow, hit a couple of real good ones. 
[01:08:00]  So I get them chips.  In the U.S., they're called pumpkins, the thousands.  But here they're white chips.  I don't know why.  What's that?  Chips.  Chips.  It's too early for that, please.  I beg you.  Started betting those.  Yeah.  I got the stack up to $12,000.  Whoa.  Who said walk away?  Strangle him. 
[01:08:30]  That would have been a good idea.  Of course, the judgment was a bit clouded from the wine and Captain and Cokes that they don't bring you at the table that they brought me every fucking five minutes.  And, you know, why leave with $12,000 when you could leave with $24,000?  Whoa.  Well, I didn't either.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I noticed the stack start going down and dwindling.  And instead of walking away, I just kept betting into the loss. 
[01:09:00]  And I'm left with nothing.  Including the original two?  I lost the original two.  Oh, fuck.  God, if we just knew how to walk away.  It would just walk away.  I know.  I don't know why.  I guess because it was, you know, it was still relatively early, 3 a.m.  And you were saying, by the way, I don't know why.  I think I have an idea.  Oh.  Because you have a problem.  But I told Keith it was just a reconnaissance mission to just see the lay of the land over there, what that casino is about. 
[01:09:30]  And then we'll go in really hot and heavy on Saturday, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  You always want to go in there and just take a $14,000 look around.  It's not real money until you cash out.  So I never look at it that way.  I looked at it as the original $2,000.  Okay. 
[01:10:00]  So, you know, if I would have built it up to $50,000, I wouldn't have cared that it was.  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  Of course I cared.  Jesus Christ.  You're reasoning.  $12,000.  You're reasoning in your own head there.  Yeah, I like doing that rationalization, as they call it.  I guess the theme of the night was walk away.  I walked away from, you know, the hookers, and you walked away.  Well, almost walked away, I guess.  No, I didn't walk away in time.  I know.  Jimmy, what about you?  I just – I had a set to do, so that's why I couldn't join you guys for dinner because I was getting there later. 
[01:10:30]  So I went with Amy and Tom Papa, and then Bobby Kelly met us after his set.  You saw Jeffrey Ross in the restaurant also.  At the end, I saw Jeff, yeah, before we left.  And, you know, we just – it was very uneventful at our table.  We just laughed.  We talked about Colin's keynotes.  Oh, Colin's keynotes.  Keynotes.  He's coming in a little later.  Yeah, it was amazing.  Yeah, I weren't.  Was it good?  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah, it was great.  I weren't.  And –  I was napping.  Oh.  Oh, there he is.  Oh.  Quinn. 
[01:11:00]  Come out here.  Please.  I love my coffee.  That was almost like magic.  I mentioned Colin, and there he was.  Oh, great.  Why didn't I mention a girl with big tits?  Colin Quinn, everyone.  Oh, look, E-Rock didn't want to come out during that.  Colin Quinn.  Sit down, Colin.  Take a seat, Carl.  Good morning.  Wonderful.  Good morning, guys.  Hi, Carl.  How are you, sir?  Thank God you mentioned me.  Yes.  Your awful staff just had me sitting back there for like 20 minutes surrounded by fucking 
[01:11:30]  Tim Hortons that you people are supposed to get that you're not going to get, apparently.  Jimmy bought donuts yesterday, Colin.  What?  He bought donuts for the crowd yesterday.  Who did, Jimmy?  I did, yes.  What a sport.  It was great.  It was a real moment bonding with the crowd.  I knew a guy that he got thrown against the plate glass window by Tim Horton.  The Tim Horton.  He punched Tim Horton's father, and then Tim Horton came over and beat the ship.  That little bit of trivia.  I love that little bit of trivia. 
[01:12:00]  It's the unknown Larry Gretzky.  I guess it was Wayne was famous.  Oh, boy.  Colin, we got to say it.  The keynote was great.  Thanks.  I loved it.  Did you work hard on it?  Did you toil?  I did, but I got very little done.  You know, I feel like the other guys doing the keynote came in from L.A., so they had  all those eight hours on the plane.  Right.  I, unfortunately, was on the plane with you guys and sitting next to Amy and a certain  gentleman was blowing gas. 
[01:12:30]  How terrible was Jimmy on that fucking plane?  Oh, it was awful.  Oh, it was brutal.  It was delightful.  The flight attendant hated our guts.  You think she noticed?  Yes.  Everyone noticed.  And I don't know why we answer his questions, because he loves this.  It was so ugly.  He gets so proud.  He's so happy.  Amy almost threw up.  I know.  If I would have got Amy Schumer to fucking vomit on herself in the plane, I would have  just got back on a plane and come right home.  Mission accomplished.  Nothing tops that. 
[01:13:00]  The farts are brutal.  Holy fuck.  So, yeah, the speech was really good.  It was, it was, it was, it was, what is, it's the keynote.  It's just about comedy, or is it more two comics, or is it about the festival?  Because you spoke a lot about, about, you know, comics and what we should be doing right  and what the business is not doing right.  I don't know, I just, so they did it the past couple of years, they don't really tell me  what the hell it was about, you know?  You just figured you'd do it, you know?  I figured I'd really.  Do what you want to do.  Yeah.  You mentioned some.  Don't take direction.  Fuck them.  You mentioned some in your keynote, and I wish you would have expanded on it. 
[01:13:30]  What part were you up for in, in, um, Austin Powers?  I was up for the sun in Austin Powers.  Oh.  I know, I seem, I seem a little long in the tooth for it, but.  I really stopped them on that one.  They're like, oh.  No, because that was interesting during your speech, you were talking about how Mike Myers  called you, you had this part, but you were working on your stuff.  I was working on my stuff.  It was a combination of arrogance and fear, and it was like.  Oh, no.  I just kept talking, and it was hard to believe. 
[01:14:00]  And so then, uh, I just was like, yeah, man, I'm doing my own, my own movie, and I had  this script I was writing, but his movie was like a go movie, like a big.  Like, I mean, it was, there was nothing about, I gave like eight reasons why I didn't want  to do it, and he gave me eight reasons why that was cleared, and it was no problem.  Yeah, but you didn't want to go in and audition, I understand that.  No, I didn't have to audition, he gave me the part.  Oh, my God.  You gave him the part.  No.  Dude.  It was based on a part I had, the only thing I had done, I wasn't like some actor, but 
[01:14:30]  he was like, yeah, I saw you do this Larry Sanders thing, just do that, what you did  there, just do that.  And why, why didn't you?  I think I was, I think it was a combination, I was scared, and I was, I had this whole idea  in my head, I was going to get my movies made.  Right.  That never happened.  Yeah, I found that interesting, we were talking about that yesterday.  Yes, it was arrogant.  Terribly arrogant.  But not as arrogant, I mean, that was a little bit of fear.  I'll say the Crocodile Dundee thing is a lot more arrogant.  Oh, writing.  And that was 10 years before.  Right, rewriting the whole script.  Rewriting the script. 
[01:15:00]  Rewriting one line, one line in the script, reading the script, just being like, this is  not New York, man.  And then rewriting it, I mean, I was like, put the worst screenwriter of all time at  the time.  My poor girlfriend had to type it up.  And then I go, she's probably thinking, why am I dating this ass?  You know, she's not even in the business, but she's like, oh, what am I doing?  Oh, and you actually turned it in to somebody.  But they say, I think it's important to remember, they say if you act like, you know, like a success  like that, you'll be successful. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, boy.  In these cases, it didn't work for me.  No.  Unlike Tom Papa parading around in his multicolored shirts.  You notice that.  You notice that.  Everyone's noticing Tom Papa's dressing.  No, I just heard you guys.  Oh, okay, okay.  I said it's 7.05 and these bastards are crashing.  Poor Tom.  And he's not even here.  Probably on here for three hours yesterday.  Yes, he was.  Doing his best.  That is a shitty thing to do.  Yeah.  Oh, we love him, though.  I don't like the pomposity of Tom's outfits.  No, it's true.  That's really irritating.  That's how we show love.  We love the guy.  He's a fool. 
[01:16:00]  But in all fairness, you know, no one knew the Austin Powers movies were going to be as huge as they became.  No, it really does kill me when I think about those three in a row.  At what point did you, like, when you did that, like, how far into it did you realize, like, oh, fuck.  Like, how long was the movie out before you were like, oh, boy.  No, like, years and years later, I was like, fuck it, man.  I didn't give a shit.  I was like, I'm going to get mine done.  Once I couldn't get any of my shit.  Because if I had done those movies, I probably could have got my things done.  That's how it works.  You have to be in those things.  And then, you know, they're like, okay, now we'll do your thing. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I made Seth Green's career.  I mean, that's got to be worth something.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was a really good story yesterday.  Thanks.  You didn't know that.  You didn't know that.  Magic.  I knew the story.  It was, but I didn't know all the, I didn't know the fear was the surprise.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I didn't want to admit my gutless, spinelessness.  But I figured, if you're going to give the keynote speech, I have to be honest.  I like that you opened up, Colin.  I really enjoyed that.  So.  Oh, boy. 
[01:17:00]  Were you nervous giving the speech?  No, only at the beginning when stupid Todd Barry.  I thought I didn't know.  Todd Glass.  Todd Glass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When he yelled out, fuck Andy Killing.  I was like, fuck you.  I didn't know who it was.  And I was just furious.  I'm idiot.  Oh.  Heckling.  Yeah.  Heckling a keynote.  Yeah, it was Todd Glass.  Oh, don't heckle a keynote speech.  But he wasn't heckling Colin to fuck him up.  He was like trying to agree with Colin.  Like, eh.  I know.  No, he was trying to like do a, I don't know.  He explained it to me last night.  He was very stoned.  No.  I was doing like the guy that doesn't get the point. 
[01:17:30]  And I was like, right.  But except I didn't know it was you.  What an asshole.  Was he mad?  Was that?  Was he mad?  I was mad.  I know, but I'm also asking if he was.  I don't give a shit.  I know.  Fuck, what would he be mad about?  He should be apologizing.  You handled it perfectly.  He should be on bended knee.  You were fine.  Why are you yelling at me?  I was just wondering if he was mad.  Well, I don't understand why you would even give him the leeway to allow him to be mad.  He has no right.  But I'm not saying he would have been right to be mad.  I'm just saying he wasn't.  Sometimes people act irrational.  Well, but couldn't you have said, well, you know, although it would have been wrong, was he mad? 
[01:18:00]  I didn't need to preface it with that.  We all knew it was wrong.  Are we ever going to go to strip clubs?  I hope so.  Let's go tonight.  I think tonight.  We decided.  Did you guys have like a midnight show tonight?  Tonight was sex night or something.  What is it?  So Wednesday we're going to strip club at fucking five in the morning.  I like a good 7 p.m. strip club.  I like a nice post-dinner strip club.  Where it's still light outside.  Where it's still light outside.  You're the early customers.  Yeah, one of the early customers.  You get the girls when they first come in.  They're fresh.  They're in a good mood.  They're fresh.  They're day strippers.  We've talked about it. 
[01:18:30]  You walk in during the day and your eyes haven't adjusted and you're just banging into  things.  Right.  You can't tell where the seats are.  Yeah.  And then when you leave and it's still light out, it's even more tragic.  You feel shitty about yourself.  You're looking at the sun like you're a vampire.  Right.  Yeah.  I've never done that.  I like to be headed home by 7.45 p.m.  I think that's the night.  Yeah.  Early to bed.  Early to rise.  Nice 45 minutes in the strip club.  For a nice dinner, right?  Yeah.  You have a little dinner.  Sure.  I used to know a girl who worked in a strip.  What the hell was it called?  In Port Washington. 
[01:19:00]  Port Washington, of course.  On Long Island.  It was run by these terrorizing bikers.  I didn't even know they were on Long Island at that time.  Pagans.  Yeah.  The pagans run all the strip clubs.  Don't touch the girls.  They used to it back in the day.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  How bad was the place?  It wasn't that bad.  Oh, it wasn't bad.  But I didn't know at the time that these guys were in the club and I'm talking as if I'm  in charge, once again, I think the pattern in my life is delusions of grandeur in every  situation.  And this guy just comes up, this big guy, like a denim jacket, it was like 1978 and just 
[01:19:30]  grabs my arm and I'm like, what the fuck?  You know, meanwhile, he's like twice my size.  He could have fucking destroyed me.  And she goes, he's in the pagans.  Why did he grab you?  Because I was like yapping off to her or something.  Oh.  Yeah, you're probably mouthing off to the girls.  Yeah.  Don't talk to them.  Let them do their work.  What did you not want to pay for a dance?  Only a comedian.  No, I was, I was, I was a real free sport, but you know, only comedians have to yap every  two seconds.  You have to yap at all situations.  I used to love those Long Island strip clubs though. 
[01:20:00]  They tried turning everything into a gentleman's club.  Right.  You used to have to go to the city and sit there and that was the $20 lap dances and  shit like that.  But on Long Island, it was all about down and dirty, man, a couple of dollars in your  pocket.  You could give a girl a buck.  She'll fucking writhe in front of you for a while and then move on to the next guy.  No, it was like that in the city too.  It was like that until like 19, the gentleman's club came because of your people, the Italian  mob decided.  Oh, is that it?  Because the bikers are like, hey man, just bring out the girls, see some dudes. 
[01:20:30]  But then these gavons get involved and they're like, a gentleman, people enjoy it because  they enjoy being a gentleman, Italians, you know.  They're like, yes, they're like the suit, they're going to get the massage.  This is, we're going to open a classy shirt.  Like their whole thing is to try to be like Wall Street.  Like they wanted to assimilate the way the Irish actually did, where they'll be like the  new wasps, but they just couldn't pull it off.  So instead they're like the outer things, like yes, I have a suit, they have a couple  of guys on Wall Street beating balls off a broker. 
[01:21:00]  And then they always give out envelopes for everything, like yes, it's an envelope.  It's an envelope.  That fixes everything, an envelope full of cash, full of ill-gotten gains.  Yeah, here you go, huh?  Hey, I appreciate what you did for me.  An envelope full of ill-gotten gains.  Yes, yes.  And then they decided to fuck the whole strip club thing up by making Gentleman Club.  That's correct.  And then you go in there and, you know, all you want is to see some fucking girl shaking 
[01:21:30]  her ass in front of you for some expensive overpriced beer.  Five-star meals.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to dress properly.  Right.  No hats.  What?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  You have to buy, or you want to buy the lady a drink?  Right.  No.  Fuck her.  Let her be thirsty.  Right.  How about, I want to buy the lady some cum.  Right.  Let her be the whore she is.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, sorry.  The lady's drink was expensive.  That was a little too harsh. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, the lady's drink.  Jesus, sorry.  And it was, it was very, ah, you could get away with not even giving the girl any money  in the strip clubs because you'd have the bar, you'd have everybody sitting at the bar,  and the girl would be dancing like two feet away from you because she's dancing in front  of the guy sitting on the next bar stool.  And there's no wall up.  So you're just looking, going, yeah.  And then she'd cut to you, you put your head down, she moves along.  Right.  And you get to see some, you know, some shit.  Now they put up walls and all sorts of shit.  You want to go in the back for a, no. 
[01:22:30]  No.  You want to go, yeah.  We have the diamond room is over.  The diamond room used to be the fucking bathroom in this shit hole.  Right.  Talking about.  But it's a good psychological thing because they go, you want to go in the back and every  guy, it doesn't matter what kind of misery you are.  You're like, once she gets back there, she'll end up wanting to do something with a guy like  me.  She's going to dig me.  I'm a gentleman.  It's the worst when you go in and you see there's a couch with a bunch of other people,  like a private, it's not the ultimate private room.  It's a, there's a bunch of people.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  And I'm like, fuck, I can't come like this.  Nothing's going to happen here.  Yeah.  I would always try to sneak one in during the lap dance.  It's like if the ass cheeks are on my dick and it's going back and forth evenly, I'm  like, I might be able to, to blow a load.  And I have a couple of times.  I've won a couple of times.  Yeah.  It's the greatest feeling.  I love that.  You're trying to sneak one in.  Oh, I love that.  And I love the, uh, the audio.  Tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk.  Well, I'm trying to.  What the hell's going on out there?  I'm trying to.  That's his penis head.  No, no.  That's the motion of her.  Yeah.  It kind of is actually her ass cheeks over the dick. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  That's what I mean.  Yes.  It's moving over your penis head.  Yeah.  It's a very, very steady motion.  You need a folia worker here to fucking make the sounds.  Yeah.  And, and, but then, you know, one time a fire broke out.  Way the other way it's meant to be.  Yes.  Yes.  Kyle, what'd you do last night?  Anything else?  Yeah.  I had to go do my show and then I had to go do a gala and then I had to go do.  Holy shit.  Did you do big J's?  It was a full night.  Well, how'd you like this?  One minute I'm doing my show, the lovely unconstitutional. 
[01:24:00]  I'm feeling so good.  Oh yeah.  Then I go over to big gala.  Eddie is it.  It's like how many thousands of people?  I gotta go do that.  Right after that, I have to rush off to the titty district and do big J's show.  I go in, I come in, he's on stage in jorts.  Like a true jerk role that he is.  Jorts.  Yes.  He's wearing jorts and he's like, and it's like a, it's like a crowd work.  I spent the whole time trashing him because it's a crowd work show.  You're not allowed to do the material.  You just work the crowd.  He opens up working the crowd, all the people up front. 
[01:24:30]  By the time I go, hey, and he's like, you know, he really is generous.  He leaves a lot for you.  Hey, what do you do?  Why don't you go suck 40 guys off, honey?  Look at this guy.  Go blow him.  It was nothing left by the time I got there.  I'm like, thanks, Jake.  Oh, wow.  Oh, he just destroyed the whole fucking crowd.  Except to trash Jay, which of course, there was plenty of that left.  You're doing unconstitutional every night up here?  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  I hope these people, these locals go and see Colin Quinn's one man show.  It's amazing. 
[01:25:00]  It really is.  Thanks.  Is it odd though that it's a whole different country?  What's that?  It's a different country.  So unconstitutional is like, hey, here's how things worked in our country.  Right, right.  It's a little strange.  You got to change it up a little bit, right?  No, you can't really change it, bud.  Wear a powdered wig or something?  Talked about the Magna Carta?  Right.  Whatever that is.  I really am a crushing bore.  No.  I'm only going to get more bore as I get older too.  I'll see my next show.  I like to do a show about electronics.  I bet you'd like to do that, Anthony. 
[01:25:30]  I love a good electronics show.  Wouldn't that be good?  Yeah, I can see the headlines.  Colin's show is shocking.  You working on another show?  No.  That's your thing now.  You got to work on more one-man shows.  No, man.  You're done.  That's it.  Two and done.  And you know who came in last night?  Huh?  Just to show the kind of clout I have in this society.  Lawrence Fishburne.  Wow.  Came in.  Then we're walking over to the gala together.  I'm walking to the gala.  People are supposed to see like, hey, Mr. Quinn. 
[01:26:00]  Like, hi, Mr. Quinn.  And they're like shoving me aside.  I'm on the show.  Nobody cared.  Fucking Morpheus, man.  Of course.  That's pretty cool.  Do you know him or did he just decide to come see you?  Yeah, no.  He grew up around the corner from me.  Oh, so you know him.  Really?  I know him since like nine.  No way.  Come on.  So you knew him when he was in Apocalypse Now?  Yeah.  Actually, we were talking about that last night.  I was on the bus.  He had moved.  But we were on the bus one, like, you know, just a city bus.  And he's yellow.  You know.  And he's just telling me, yeah, I'm in this movie with Marlon Brando.  And I was sitting on the bus going, yeah, Lawrence Fishburne cracked up. 
[01:26:30]  He lost his mind.  Oh, really?  I thought he was crazy.  But he really did.  Actually, ladies and gentlemen, Colin Quinn was off at the part of Charlie Sheen.  Yes.  And Robert Kelly was off at the part of Colonel Kurtz.  Bobby was saying he came in here yesterday.  He's brutal.  On one hour's sleep.  And one of his eyes was all infected.  He goes, dude, they come in right away.  They're like fat.  He said he just got brutally hammered for like a time.  He passed it on to DeRosa, though. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, no.  He was killing yesterday.  Everyone.  Were you on his podcast or did he tell you what I did to his fuck in his room?  No.  Oh, yes.  He showed a picture of a defecatory moment he had in the room.  Oh, did he?  I had to take a shit.  So I told Bobby, I got to use your toilet because he's staying here at the Hyatt.  Of course, I'm not.  And I went up and I was so proud of myself because he left me alone in the room.  So I dropped a horrible deuce and then just left it.  And I put the do not disturb sign in the door just so the maid wouldn't come in and 
[01:27:30]  spoil it by flushing and cleaning.  And I left the fucking thing up and I couldn't have been prouder.  Wow.  But I really was disappointed in myself because as I'm doing it, I'm like, if I had one ounce  of moral fortitude, I would shit in his tub.  Oh, God.  If I had one ounce of balls.  What stopped you from doing that?  Because he has to be up here for a few days.  And it's like him fishing my shit out of the tub.  He might have just...  It might have been too much. 
[01:28:00]  You would have put him over the top.  If it was his last night here, I would have shat in his tub.  I just couldn't pull the trigger.  It might have been like a sit-down moment.  It was like, dude, I mean, we joke around, but see.  Yeah.  Dude, I got to put my feet in there.  Dude, this fucking...  What he said, the saddest part of that story, he told that on a podcast yesterday, was that  he actually...  You used some ruse that he fell for.  No.  He was like...  You were like, hey, man, I have to go up to you, but you have to come with me or something.  There was no ruse. 
[01:28:30]  I wanted Bobby to come with me because keys demagnetize all the time.  So I'm like, just come up with me in case I can't get in the room because I have to shit.  I don't want to be up there with your key standing outside your room.  If he couldn't get in, maybe he can get a maid to let us in.  So that was no ruse.  I didn't know he was going to leave.  We were getting the seats for your show.  And he's like, I'll go down and save us a couple of seats.  And I just decided, why waste it?  It's here.  Why get rid of it without Bobby enjoying it, too?  It was about being giving.  And I'm like...  But it wasn't a ruse.  I didn't plan on doing it until he left me alone. 
[01:29:00]  You should have left it in the tub.  Dude, without it, it will go down as one of my great regrets.  A nice bubble bath.  Make it a bubble bath with one fucking log just floating around.  Just for him to pull his curtain back and see my fucking festering log.  It's not too late.  I think we can get this done, still.  That's what a fucking animal does.  Yeah.  Like marking the territory.  That's so...  Yeah, but animals don't hide behind the tree and then laugh when the other animals...  That's true.  Stumbles upon it. 
[01:29:30]  They can't enjoy it like you, though.  Yeah, they can't.  They mean it.  Oh, it's sickening.  I feel like it wouldn't be so sick if there wasn't toilet paper involved.  You know, if it was just like natural shit like animals...  Yeah.  It wouldn't be that bad.  But that toilet paper, really...  I think toilet paper really ruins the whole thing.  It takes the natural out of it, yeah.  If you put the toilet paper on the side of the bowl, you have to for anyone young who wants  to try this.  You put it around above the water to present properly.  You don't want to spoil your work.  Present?  Yeah.  Just use it to frame it, not to hide it. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, you don't hang something in the museum and then throw a cloth on it.  Right.  Of course, Jimmy.  It's all about the presentation.  Implying his shit is art.  Absolutely.  That's great.  Roland!  Wonderful.  Just want to say hi.  Roland's there, yeah.  That was good.  He was fun at dinner last night, too.  Quite a few laughs at the table.  Young Sam Roberts.  Roland is the best to travel with.  He's out of his fucking mind, yeah.  He was a lot of fun.  We were laughing at different things we were going to be doing here. 
[01:30:30]  I guess tonight was going to be sex night.  Sex night?  What do you mean, was?  What do you mean?  No, no, I mean, it is.  You have a show tonight, a midnight special.  That doesn't matter.  We're in, we're out.  Hey, this could be a good name for it, the midnight special.  Oh, that's a good one.  Jot that down.  Yeah, late and naughty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going on first.  I'm claiming first right now.  Okay.  I'm not going to wait for everybody else to do that fucking dickiest material.  You're not supposed to tell people you're part of the surprise show.  Oh.  Whoops.  If you were, you'd want to go on first.  Exactly. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Has anyone done any recon as far as strip clubs go?  Yeah.  I saw a place called the Pink Taco.  Is that a, is that a strip club?  I'm assuming it's a strip club.  Well, ask these guys.  I don't know.  Where should we go?  Wanda's.  Wanda's?  Oh, everyone's saying Wanda's.  Wanda's, huh?  Go to that guy.  Is that good?  What's up at Wanda's?  I'm guessing good pussy or something like that.  I'm guessing.  And good steak, too.  But I'm, I'm almost married, so I haven't been a long time.  Ah, I don't like a place that serves food and pussy. 
[01:31:30]  No, that's a gentleman's club thing.  That's a gentleman's club.  Hey, we'll have some food for the people, the patrons, when they come in our clientele.  All right.  Hey, here you go.  All right, Wanda's.  Write it down.  Yeah.  Wow, is there a place a little below Wanda's?  Like someplace where they might be making meth in the back?  What's the next step down from Wanda's?  Because you want desperation.  You don't want girls that are making $1,000 a night because they're the fucking worst. 
[01:32:00]  I want a girl who might make $30 or $40.  But needs $1,000.  Needs.  So your 20 looks like a, looks like a thousand.  I want my crisp US 20 to look like a fucking, like a beacon in the night.  Yeah, so Wanda's, huh?  I went to a dump.  I shot a pilot for MTV right before we came back on.  This is like the end of 2000, maybe 2004.  And it was a terrible pilot where I was like a camp counselor and there was a fucking,  there was a little, that was the Mikey the Chimp.  That was the pilot I did with the chimp. 
[01:32:30]  Doesn't sound terrible.  Adorable.  No, no, no.  It was, it was really good.  They figured BJ and the bear worked so well that they would bring the chimp and fucking guy thing back.  I understood the connection.  Oh.  Yeah, I really did fucking leave that one hanging there.  I caught a hanger.  So, the chimp and then you and who plays modern man in that?  One third actor.  It was, it was, it was not a good pilot, but I went to a strip club after and, oh, it was actually right before we came back on because I knew we were coming back on. 
[01:33:00]  Did he take the chimp with you?  Adorable.  Yeah, it was cute.  Then he ripped the clit off a woman and threw it and, because she smiled at it, not knowing the teeth were a sign of aggression.  And, uh, it was really great.  They were all broke.  It was upstate New York.  And I probably spent, I think it's the only time I've ever left this strip club broke because I got lap dances.  But they were all real fucking dirtbag girls.  Can you describe the sound?  Um. 
[01:33:30]  Shunk, kunk, shunk, kunk, shunk, kunk.  Yeah, it was like.  And then the horse came.  And then so did I.  It was, uh, it was the only time I ever left the strip club broke because they were all so fucking desperate and dirty.  And every, it was total nudity.  Like, you know what I mean?  You'd hand her, like, a few bucks at the bar and she would just pop the phone aside and let it flop.  It was a fucking marvelous place.  They all wave goodbye as she believes.  Yeah, yeah, it was heartbreaking. 
[01:34:00]  It's the whole story.  I like it.  Yeah, me too.  It's a good story.  Yeah, so we're going to do that tonight, I guess.  I don't know, before or after the fucking, that midnight thing is really fucking us up.  The midnight thing was a horrible idea.  I remember when I first heard it, I was like, really, guys, you're doing the fucking midnight show?  Yeah.  We don't have to do that, right?  Yeah, you do.  You can't get out of it now.  Fuck.  Christ.  What do we have to do?  What's our fucking?  We just say, hey.  You guys could probably shell out about eight grand and get us all out of it if you really want to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just have to go, hey, here's Colin Quinn. 
[01:34:30]  We don't have to say that for every comic.  That's all we do.  Is it a Tim Hortons?  Tim Hortons.  Where is our show tonight?  Does anybody know?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Anybody on the staff know where our show is?  What?  That's the middle of the strip place.  That's where it was last night, right?  St. Catherine's Theater.  Is that how far from Club Soda at Metropolis?  This cocksucker is ignoring my perfect MapQuest directions and going right over my head.  Wait, what did you say?  I told you.  That's what Big J shows in the middle of the strip club district.  All right.  How dare you dismiss me? 
[01:35:00]  I'm out of hand.  No, I'll just go out and we can do it during the show.  Shut up.  That's not what I'm saying.  We can't do it during the show.  Why not?  What kind of ridiculous thing is that?  You're going to go to get a lap dance and get back to the show?  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  That's absurd.  Yeah.  I fucked a girl over the toilet at WNEW and made it back on the air.  Ooh.  Yeah.  During the commercials.  Lucky of that story.  Yeah.  During the commercials, he did.  A girl that took a-  How about the time Once It Face came on and goes, hey, Opie, you want a blowjob?  Oh, Sandy King.  Sandy King.  Oh.  And I said no.  It was my happiest moment because it was somebody with self-esteem. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  Where she literally said in front of all of us, Opie's walking by the bathroom in the  range.  She goes, hey, Opie, you want a blowjob?  And he goes, ugh, no.  And that would devastate most 90-year-old women who died, you know, and she goes, what are  you, gay?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, apparently, if you don't take a blowjob from her, from a fucking 90-year-old woman.  A witch.  Oh.  Great.  Now she's going to sue us again.  Fuck.  Thanks for bringing her up. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, she tried to sue us.  Last year, this time, we had to go to court three times.  Three times.  She didn't show.  She was playing us, Colin.  She knew she had no case, but she knew she could fuck with us.  She knows the system.  Yeah.  So we kept going down there, and she didn't show up.  And instead of, like, you know, throwing the case out, they're like, well, we're going  to redo this in a month.  She got us three times to go down there.  Three times.  And each time, I started laughing.  I'm like, all right, that's pretty good.  I wasn't mad.  Each time walking back from the court, I went through Times Square, and there she was. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  She was supposed to have been in court, and there she was with her fucking E.T. body and  cowboy hat.  Fucking.  You guys know her?  Horrifying the tourists.  Her pictures are going everywhere now.  She's.  Horrifying.  She's becoming an internet sensation.  She is?  Why?  Because she's a monster with a guitar.  Right.  So people are.  Her pictures is popping up everywhere.  But she played us, Carl.  And I'm like, all right, that's all right.  I can't be mad at that.  Oh, bitch.  I fuck her.  No, but Jimmy, yeah, he took a broad into the bathroom. 
[01:37:00]  A girl that drove how many hours?  Ten hours from Cleveland.  Ten hours from Cleveland.  She took a bus.  A local.  She took a local from Cleveland.  Yeah.  Ten hours.  In between breaks, he went in the bathroom.  Well, I told you about, I told you about the time Jim had, during his phase when some  girl would show up, like this girl from, I guess he met like a Craigslist runaway or  something.  And then we're driving her back to the, driving her back.  I should do it with a young lady, back to Penn Station.  And Jim's driving her and I made some crack and she goes, what do you want to have sex with 
[01:37:30]  me for $250 or something?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What a gimmick.  I remember that.  I guess they figure that wouldn't count if it's a cop.  Well, she was basically saying, like, instead, you know, the theory, you know, what do you  want to have sex with me for a million dollars?  But she actually had her.  Had an amount.  Yeah.  She had an amount that's been previously negotiated.  Yes.  I don't, I don't think I ever fucked that girl.  I know who you mean.  I don't remember her name, but I remember her.  I don't think I ever fucked her.  She's a delightful person. 
[01:38:00]  She was.  She was beautiful, but I didn't fuck her.  I want to talk to the woman that has never heard us before and she's here.  She must be horrified.  Oh my goodness.  She must be horrified.  Someone that never heard us.  There's a woman that never heard this show.  What, miss, did you just get ears today?  Hi, what's your name?  Hi, it's Katerina.  Hi, Katerina.  Are you horrified?  I just need to know.  No, not at all.  I think you're hilarious.  Okay, because these guys are used to it, but I, you know, someone that has never heard  us before and is listening to this.  No, not at all.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  What made you come today?  Who brought you?  My friend Alex.  He's a really big fan.  Alex.  And Alex, what happened, Alex?  You said, I kind of want to bring you someplace to possibly end our friendship.  I was going to come with a friend of mine.  He bailed, so I called her and she's like, yeah, I'm totally down.  So she came to me.  Nice.  Why wouldn't she be first choice?  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  What are you, faggy?  It's okay.  Let's drive a wedge between this friendship.  Yes.  Yes.  Have them hate each other. 
[01:39:00]  On the way home, she will be like, yeah, why wasn't I first, by the way?  Yeah.  They'll be like, no, you know, Don loves the show.  I think we broke up a couple of relationships yesterday, right?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  They just came to enjoy the show and we're beating them up.  That one girl was really sexy.  I got a nice email from her boyfriend.  Oh, really?  Remember Elliot the artist who we talked about yesterday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he was fine.  He's a big fan.  And he said, hey, thanks, man.  I love the show and I wish I could have come.  So we were happy as girlfriends.  She had a really good body.  So we were making her do yoga poses.  I saw that yoga.  I was here for that.  Oh, you were here for that part. 
[01:39:30]  I escorted Tom Puppet now to the show and then left.  Oh, right.  She sat on my lap for a photo and it was, you know, kind of funny.  Like, ha, ha, ha.  But I was like, oh, fuck.  Her hiney feels good on my leg.  Ah, that was crazy.  You must have loved getting the boyfriend's email.  Oh, I was so happy that Elliot enjoyed it.  Yeah.  Great.  But he was a good sport.  He was checking up on you.  He handled it better than I would have.  He was a good sport.  That's how humiliating it is.  No one, no guy sees me as a threat though.  Look at how cute she sat in your lap.  You little slug. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Are you single, by the way, Katerina?  Oh, cool.  How long have you been single?  Oh, sorry.  You don't have a mic.  I'm just curious.  Hold on.  Troy Kwan running in.  Can we have a fucking uglier staff member do it other than Troy?  If I'm trying to talk to a girl, can we not have the fucking guy in shape with the fucking  cool tattoos?  Yes.  I would say about a year now.  About a year?  What happened?  It just decided it wasn't working out.  I don't know. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  Bitch on wheels?  I'm not sure.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you miss him?  No.  Oh, good.  It's amicable.  It's not a bad thing.  So you're dating now, just kind of casually?  I'm just enjoying life.  Oh.  Oh.  Clay in the field?  Are you asking me out?  Oh.  Oh.  Hold on a minute, sir.  Yeah.  Maybe we can go to perhaps for lunch.  Jimmy just wants lunch.  Yeah.  Let's go out for perhaps some beans.  Oh.  Beans. 
[01:41:00]  It's random.  It's a random food choice.  I would like that.  Yeah.  So we can go hat shopping.  Yeah.  Hat shopping.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Hat shopping.  Pop my collar.  Can't wait.  So excited.  You're very lovely.  Look at that.  What kind of work do you do?  I'm a makeup artist.  A makeup artist?  Oh, good.  So she's looking like, all right, I could probably fix him until he's presentable.  A little bit.  Give me two hours with that face.  I can make him tolerable in public.  45 max.  I am 45.  Is that what you're saying?  Sure.  Okay. 
[01:41:30]  I might be too old for you.  No.  How old are you?  31.  Oh, you're too old for me.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm joking.  She's very pretty.  She's really hot.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, well, go out.  We'll have a nice lunch.  Oh, that sounds nice.  A little connection.  Oh, wait.  I didn't know if she was saying yes or not.  Are you saying yes?  I guess I am, yeah.  Cool.  That's how you want to hear it.  I guess I am.  Yeah, I guess.  Well, if I have to.  I guess on the radio, yeah.  But how is she going to get home if the guy drove over here? 
[01:42:00]  I don't mean to Cockboa.  No, we didn't drive.  You didn't drive?  No, we both live around here.  Oh, you live?  Oh, perfect.  We go for lunch right back to the house.  Take it to the Hyatt.  They have a lovely restaurant here.  Yes, they have a lovely bathroom, too.  Yeah, egg-spectations downstairs.  Do you like eggs?  Do you like egg puns?  What a clever name, egg-spectations.  Everything in there is an egg pun.  Yeah.  The yolk's on you.  Yeah.  Oh, that's awful.  Right.  The ovary omelet was a bit much. 
[01:42:30]  It was a bit much.  Now, are you going to curtail what you say so as not to offend her for the rest of the show?  No, I'm just kidding.  Why would I?  I mean, I just talk about respecting and honoring women like I do every day.  Oh, wow.  You're a good man.  I don't curtail anything.  Wow.  You're a good man.  Yeah, absolutely.  I don't, you know, that's my job here, just to kind of keep the guys in.  I like the fact the show is so ugly that Troy is the pinnacle of good-looking. 
[01:43:00]  Well, he's mediocre at best.  I'm not saying that Troy is a model, but again, let's be honest.  The company he's in, he's fucking, Troy's an 11 right now.  You know, Sam is the guy you want holding the mic.  You know, he's kind of wiry.  Oh, Sam.  Don't know what he is.  Yeah.  Don't quite know what he is over there.  He's just this biracial, androgynous thing.  I guess we got a date, Jimmy.  Yeah.  It's looking real.  All right.  You didn't just say that for the radio, right?  No.  All right, cool.  Oh, I'm noticing more ladies here today than yesterday. 
[01:43:30]  That, you might have blew the load a little too early there, Jim.  Well, what?  We have a tentative.  A tentative date, just in case something else doesn't pan out.  What a scumbag.  I think it's, we'd be.  Well, why don't we see if there's any other ladies?  We do have a single gal here who came alone.  A single gal.  Oh, let's say hi to her. 
[01:44:00]  Just wanted to get to know her.  I would have assumed you were with one of the, that's good they have you sandwiched in between  these men.  I'm fine with it.  Oh, good.  All right.  You have very nice calves, I can see from here.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  He's always open with a compliment.  Jim, you always had good calves, too, I have to be honest.  Yeah, I've been, people are always surprised.  Lovely hairless calves.  Yeah, my calves are really good.  Very bowling pin-like.  Yeah.  My calves are really.  Upside-down bowling pins.  I wear knickers a lot to showcase the calves. 
[01:44:30]  Language.  Oh.  What's up, knicker?  What's your name?  My name is Kelly.  Kelly?  Yes.  And are you from the area?  I'm from Toronto.  Toronto.  What brings you here?  You guys, the comedy festival.  All alone?  You just decided, I'm going to branch out, take a little trip by myself.  This was a huge bonus for me, yeah.  Wow.  How would you like some real, a real bonus?  Jimmy.  Jimmy, I saw you in Toronto in November.  Thank you.  Did you enjoy the show?  I loved it.  Oh. 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  Looks like we have a little cat fight here.  She's nodding.  What do you do in Toronto?  I'm an accountant.  That's good.  I know.  No.  Makeup artists would have been better to say, I guess.  No, no, no.  Jobs don't matter because of an accountant.  It sounds like a boring job and you're dealing with numbers, but they, a lot of times, are the biggest perverts.  Oh.  Because, you know what I mean?  They have this job all day where it's very, you know, I almost said very numerical, but then I realized how I would blow it with you by saying very numerical. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  But it's a very kind of stiff job, so you let loose in the sack.  Oh.  We sure are getting points with her there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Do you have nice feet?  I see you're wearing a little flip-flop, so you probably have presentable feet.  They're okay today.  Today?  Why don't they change?  Yeah, why don't you know, okay, today?  I could use a pedicure, but they're okay.  That's a good foot.  This is horrible flirting.  Not talon-like.  You don't think I'm a good flirt?  Oh, my God, it's horrendous.  You have good calves and let me see your feet and your numerical. 
[01:46:00]  Holy fuck.  Well, I'm working my way up.  You can't go right for the clitoris.  Okay, all right.  Now, if I ask about the clitoris, it was just an illogical progression.  It's about the ankles and feet.  Oh, my God.  Is it 8 o'clock yet?  What's your name?  Kelly.  Kelly.  Okay, you said that.  Kelly and Ketterit.  Very nice.  It is nice to have women at the show.  Kelly, single.  Yes.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah, what happened?  This is a very good question.  No, I don't know.  I like being single.  Are you damaged goods?  Hmm?  Are you damaged goods? 
[01:46:30]  A lot of baggage?  No.  No, not really.  Daddy issues?  Maybe.  He likes the daddy issues.  Anthony, you like daddy issues.  Anthony requires them.  It's the only way out.  That has to be on your resume.  Yeah, a good daddy issue is very helpful.  To swoop in like a predator.  How old are you?  I'm probably too old for you guys.  I'm 34.  That's a good age.  I'm 45. 
[01:47:00]  You look very young.  Thank you.  You look terrific.  You?  Jesus, Jimmy.  Would you go to lunch with Jimmy?  I would love to go to lunch with Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Now we got a situation.  Jimmy and his hero.  No, because there's lunch and there's company.  Yeah, there's brunch and there's lunch.  Why don't we go hack and do a date?  Let's do a dating game now.  Let's go hack.  Head out.  And have Jimmy like pick one of these ladies.  It's not hack if it's done correctly.  True.  This thing is hack unless it's done right.  You guys heard my airplane honk yesterday at the keynote. 
[01:47:30]  It was great.  Any other single ladies here?  One more for dating game.  This day.  No?  You got a couch?  No more.  Look at that.  This is already.  So you're taken back there?  You're taken.  So, Jimmy, why don't we ask the two girls a couple questions and then maybe.  Oh, and then Jimmy can decide.  Put them on the dating game couch.  I want to see.

[01:54:00]  say do you do you know i'm saying is her opinion that it's a that it's it's a passing fade and it's  just something kind of silly that people are doing or that it's a good thing and it's probably here to  stay i don't know i feel like every every decade had their own thing right like 70s it was one thing  and it's time to you know maybe that the uh it comes back the other way we going retro a little bit  it might go backwards just kind of like the mustache came back you know yeah yeah it took a little hit  after 1945 in germany the mustache took a real hit it's gonna be ironic hipster pubic hair yes 
[01:54:30]  yeah because um you know well i know what jimmy's getting at what do you support  what she goes really what's where we need the alcohol oh my god dude i am not i mean you want  to answer that i mean i'll listen but i don't know how it works do i show you what yes whoa no i  didn't think you would but you when you said that i had to jump on it with a yes that was very uh very 
[01:55:00]  good now you could tell what you what kind of uh you know what you do do you do you is it is it uh  wood floor i would say i take care of things you take care of but do you take care of it you like  she says all the way keep it tight uh no not all the way that's not that's a little extreme for me  yeah you like to leave a little something sure yeah yeah a little mystery is good is is the uh is  what's left um natural shape or is it shaved into like a landing strip a hitler mustache yeah well i 
[01:55:30]  i go to a place so they they usually do it for oh you go to a place a maple leaf once in a while you  know yeah yeah mix it up exactly it's the habs logo yeah yeah l.a guns album cover randy rhodes v guitar  yeah nice what about the hip poster from 88 what about kelly over there i got greedy kelly what do  you do i go to a place oh you go to a place also i go to a place yeah yeah yeah yeah and do they is 
[01:56:00]  is it complete or do they leave a little something it's it's almost complete yeah almost almost complete  oh complete okay i can imagine that when you're on the beach say you're going beaching  when beaching do you enjoy wearing white bikinis oh would you wear a white bikini or what a disturbing  question no no no it's a very nice question like would you would you wear a white bikini on the  beach or would you say i can't because you know my vagina's bulging is going to really bother people  wow great question jimmy likes a particular type right infatuation with vaginas that look like a 
[01:56:30]  sideways chimps mouth i feel like yeah i feel like this is one of those questions on the list the guy  that had those women tied up in cleveland for 10 years just to ask them jimmy likes a sloppy sandwich  yeah yeah to be honest with you it's not necessarily true it wouldn't matter to me it's about who the  people are right maybe like a vagina it looks like an explosion at the stakeums factory yeah 
[01:57:00]  it's been described in many ways by jim norton many ways yeah you want to uh take that question on  ladies yeah does it wear a bikini oh yeah i don't really see the problem either i don't know why you  seem to think it's a problem hey oh no a feminist twist onto the show no okay let me point kelly let me  let me say let me rephrase he was saying just the opposite i was saying just you might want to  phrase it delicately as a three-year-old just walked in the room in the back all right well here's the 
[01:57:30]  thing now no i was saying because i think society a lot of times gives the the the uh the the protruding  big vagina a bad name i happen to defend that vehemently in all walks of life you're right like a  a lot of times a woman with a large clitoris has been shamed oh hey elephant trunk clit or whatever  it is oh look at you and your giant lips and the nerve she's hurt and i defend that so i think the 
[01:58:00]  white bikini on a larger vagina is appropriate quite a guy yeah i'm good like that so i was wondering if  either one of you would be ashamed to wear a white bikini he was hoping yeah yeah yeah he was hoping  you'd be ashamed yeah yeah yeah i was hoping no no i had to put it in the locker when i changed my  clothes nice tight like a cherry stone clam that's good one of those unshuckable clams i like that  where the guy has to put it down and go this can't open it nice see i don't like that what i don't need 
[01:58:30]  that unshuckable clam what do you like i want it to look like just two shells with sashimi piled on it  he's a romantic isn't he colin oh my god god i love him short conjures up an image  yeah that's exactly why i came here yeah if we're going in the delicious treat route i mean 
[01:59:00]  yes i might as well go all in yeah am i asking sexy questions this is quite  what's a good question maybe somebody from the audience would have a good question i could ask  one of the girls oh all right yeah you guys know what jimmy likes anyone have a question for the  ladies yeah ask me back there on jimmy's behalf yeah be nice the girls are very nice troy got fired  from his job i'm glad to see sam really isn't that's right very busy sam looks like a montreal resident  doesn't he yeah he does like a hipster montreal how many people have spoken french to you immediately 
[01:59:30]  everybody everybody speaks french here wow good answer  everybody speaks french here it's like they got a different word for everything you got your number  yeah sir say you sam come on oh i have a question for the uh i actually have a question for the  friend how awkward is this oh very good they're just friends but is the friend trying to you know get  something going with her where are you where you're trying to get no no he's like yes a friend is a 
[02:00:00]  friend no means yes that was a question on jimmy's behalf anyone have a question yeah some lovely  lady ah sam the second row over here ask him the question get cereal moment a serial killer on a  dating game what about the question yes yes yes long arms mcgillicuddy yes this guy oh he had big arms  have you ever worked at like an animal shelter and had to milk cats  oh wow delicate delicate squeezing wow that's a i didn't even know they milk cats they don't 
[02:00:30]  i think he's i think you caught somebody jerking a cat off and they lied to you  over their cereal i might be wrong but i think he's implying the fact that jimmy does like having  his nipples tweaked oh i like my nipples toyed with sometimes i'll just brush them like this  and i'm like ah that was delightful like i like a nice brush of the nipple would you just put on a  disgusted face if you had to deal with that no i don't i don't think so no you'd find that like sexy 
[02:01:00]  the cat thing or the nipple no but that was just weird that is weird but i i saw where it was going  there yeah okay no i don't think that's strange no you don't think that's me you'd you'd be into  that now how how do you feel about uh spanking a gentleman  as a theory do you think spanking a gentleman while he's over your knee with his trousers pulled  down sobbing softly yes yes with his in that case you'd probably have to oh you'd have to yeah yeah 
[02:01:30]  nice wow a couple of good swats right yeah because most women like to be spanked but a lot of them  don't like doing the spank no they don't but then they get into it if you just they get a couple a  lot of hostility women comes out if you let it come out oh really yeah on a um one to ten scale let's  say five being just normal average sexual conduct a one to ten scale yeah not to say five was no no no 
[02:02:00]  because but it doesn't that would be a five but but carl one isn't the the the base here five is  because five would be normal sexual conduct ten is outlandishly perverse and one is a bore in bed no it  ain't oh oh no it's not an age scale uncle paul you're a goddamn liar uncle paul is just big 
[02:02:30]  how would you where would you where would you place yourself in your sexual prowess and uh i don't  want to tell everyone good giving it away it's just a number are you really crazy it's just a number  which is what he said to his last three girlfriends yes it's just a number so i told the da i feel like  if i tell you the real number everyone's gonna think i'm putting you on and oh it's whoa  all right pick something in the middle it's like yeah so i'm just gonna say five no whatever's on  five is average we won't think you're putting us on we won't because just well just for the sake of 
[02:03:00]  things and being a lady i'm gonna say eight oh nice but but she means ten she's crazy she's dying  she's a little nutty yeah i like when she said it she said it with total conviction and confidence  it's not like acting she's like look i know what i do kelly what about you i was gonna say seven but  i guess i better say eight now no seven seven all right she could serve she's an accountant so she's 
[02:03:30]  like hey seven's the good number yes better to err on the side of caution that's right exactly  sometimes it's missionary with my shoes off yeah she's a wild woman only on special days yes  i think they're both pretty good yeah you're gonna have a tough choice jimmy they're both  great very uh well lunch to remember we can we do have to take a break yes we do so maybe uh you know  maybe you could think about it we could come back ask more questions yeah maybe they'll tweak your

[02:28:00]  again yeah already already well you know it's weird when you get engaged a couple things happen  there's supposed to be joy there that didn't happen they're supposed yeah uh but but no you  know as soon as you get engaged i just find myself now i'm overly critical of her like you know i'm  sitting there looking at her like oh no you know like a lot of that because now it's not just a  girlfriend now it's the future wife right and i thought you know i got engaged it buy me a little  time but now every day it's like when's the wedding when when is the wedding where are we going to have 
[02:28:30]  the wedding boy and uh we actually had a fight a couple nights ago over over that like she was  yeah because at some point like i don't know if this is true for everybody but she she goes well  what kind of wedding you want i'm like i'm not the girl you know you know what i mean like isn't that  your choice and it became a it's sort of a big deal and so uh because of that fight we we almost  weren't engaged anymore wow yeah so i need to i need to they want to they want to feel though that  the guy is as excited as they are so when when they say what kind of wedding they expect you to 
[02:29:00]  go oh yeah i want this that oh no i don't what i say is i've been married twice this is number three  nothing to me yeah well no not i'm not gonna oh you can't say that it means nothing to me it is a  one-sided contract i'm about to enter into absolutely outside of that it's going pretty good okay  do you know what year you're getting married well i imagine next year oh it is next year yeah i mean  i can't date not set no that's a big problem for them too i mean i really thought it would buy me  a little time but it's not and it's her first yeah it's her first so she wants the whole deal 
[02:29:30]  no she doesn't it's beautiful oh she's like uh she said no i just wanted to be us and then she  said your mother can come but i'd rather she didn't wow my father said that a lot yeah  so what she wants to do is just get married the two of us so it's our day and then she wants to take  a trip and then maybe have a party for other people no it's great let me tell you how that  won't work out because you uh you don't invite people they get mad you invite one or two people 
[02:30:00]  now you have to invite other people because they'll get mad that you invited somebody yeah  and you can't invite nobody because there's people that are very close to you so it's going to be  quite a few people even if it's going to be 400 people yeah it's just this leads to a 400 people  i tried that i was like uh you know i don't want at my at my lovely lovely wedding yeah that i had  at a place that later became a strip club in comac in in honor of your failed wedding yeah it became 
[02:30:30]  a strip club in honor of my failed wedding it became a strip club and the account that used to  do mine and opie's taxes did it in the basement of the same strip club that i got married in it's  all one whole big melange of shit uh yeah so so uh uh we didn't want to invite anybody yeah and  then she's like well my mother has to right and then i'm like well now if your mother comes and my  mother finds out and that i didn't invite her so then you got to invite that and now what's mom 
[02:31:00]  gonna come alone no she needs fucking sal with her and this one needs that and then the the  fucking brother and sister now have and before you know it full house 400 people well the second  what were you asking sorry mark what were you asking colin you were asking i was asking if it  was a catering hall first i'd like to know for an episode of the fucking talk now listen  i want the name of that catering hall that you got married in comac oh well it's now called 
[02:31:30]  like the debonair the debonair it was the inn at the crossroads right where jericho and 347 split  uh in comac the stefanos have a piece of that too right yeah yeah of course  we may i think i saw you at the door a couple times yeah that was that was wonderful uh yeah  what a wedding what a wedding that was it was the place my mom worked at i did the small wedding the  second one and that didn't work i mean i we i got married in the backyard uh for this for the second  wife and that happened pretty quickly and the rules on that one i think was you know no fathers so there 
[02:32:00]  were no fathers at this boy yeah so you know that's gonna work out a little baggage yeah when she says i  don't want my dad here i'm like all right this is this not a red flag that is good oh my god i'll  just step into that role i guess is what's gonna happen so oh the steamer trunk of baggage yeah but  i knew it i knew it and i kind of i kind of know it this time too but i have i'm older now so i figure  i'm tired uh she wants to have a kid so i think you know that's what i no no that's okay no that was  not what that look was well he doesn't like kids i was just thinking it on my own again i was 
[02:32:30]  i was thinking of yourself not not anybody everybody i've seen that has had kids yeah  opium stuff and travis they love it it changes your life right and that's a good reason to  change your life change your life yeah yeah i want to have a kid because i don't feel good about me  well that yeah yeah is that the reason people have children that's kind of why i don't want to i  kind of like the fact that i could just fucking you know yeah walk around i don't have to worry  about looking at my pool if there's fucking something at the bottom you know yeah it's right  that's the last thing you need when you're taking a dip whoops you know i don't need that 
[02:33:00]  it's all going well it's going to be good i'm excited about it i love her it's it's crazy and  yeah but uh the neighbors haven't called the cops or anything so we're on a better trajectory has every  girl you've been with had some kind of father issue don't they all do you go for i'm assuming they  do and the ones that say they don't are full of yeah the ones they say that don't uh you know  they're kind of boring i mean if they people don't really have if people aren't fucked up i 
[02:33:30]  mean they're not even on my radar it's not even going to register other than like oh what's that  person doing yeah i've had people tell me though after a while because i i apparently every ex-girlfriend  i've ever had is batshit crazy and i've had people go you know maybe it's not them maybe your pick  and they start doing that and i'm like fuck man i don't even have anything to come back to i find if a  woman is like like and i'm not just meeting somebody but if i date somebody and they're attracted to me  and they enjoy our sex there has to be a problem by default something wrong i i found that in like 
[02:34:00]  in my life as soon as a woman says uh you know i'm getting along so much better with my father i'm  two weeks away from a breakup yeah that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah and the one thing you don't want  is to get together with a girl that has problems with the father and then they have this like  makeup thing and now he's in your fucking life yeah she's talking to him a lot you're you're just an  idiot she made a mistake with her dad's telling the same stories you've been telling her about the  same shows my favorite martian where have i heard that oh my boyfriend yeah when you could really 
[02:34:30]  carry on a a real relatable conversation with the dad you know hey i remember graduating that same  year yeah yeah it gets a little uncomfortable yeah that's what i'm in yeah why don't we ask the  yes a why don't we ask the future uh possible lunch dates if they have uh father issues that's  a good question yeah yeah go ahead uh we gotta robberts we gotta stop up yeah all right you  fucking twink jimmy might go out of there jay mark maron with one of these girls i met a couple of  the gals here yeah i mean he's still trying to figure it out going over there huh all right any uh daddy issues 
[02:35:00]  they don't always know you know i know that's why i mean they they don't see that they have any issues  right they're just not speaking to him and they cry when they hear his name this was my here's  here's the baggage my ex-wife had yeah as far as daddy issues goes uh i guess she was probably 13 14  years old uh christmas day christmas day nice the dad walked out on the family on christmas day when 
[02:35:30]  she was 14 got himself a whole new family yeah and never spoke to the other family again so christmas was  a joy with her every here comes santa claus here comes oh he fucked them up big time christmas day  so every christmas and father's day and anything to do with dad this was a piece of yeah that was 
[02:36:00]  terrible let's ask the girls there anything uh kelly how's your relationship with your dad kelly  i guess if i said i had no daddy issues that would you would know i was lying anyway so maybe a  little bit i could say the fact that you flew here alone to see this show leads me to believe that  you don't have the ward cleaver type dad at home you're probably right yeah uh so when did he walk out 
[02:36:30]  um i was 19 19 when he decided he was just gonna what it's take off and was it another uh lady yes it  was he was cheating on your mom yes and it's nice he waited till you're at least legal yeah yeah  yeah that's all he left in childhood that's good did you still talk to him yes oh yeah oh all right  did you know things were amiss before he left no i was oh wow well afterwards i was like oh yeah  obviously in hindsight right yeah whenever i walked into the bathroom he was washing his dick in the 
[02:37:00]  sink wow oh my god this is the saddest dating game ever it is sad did uh did your mom bad mouth him a  lot after that like oh not too bad it wasn't too bad really yeah maybe she kept it to herself because  that's that's always the best thing because my mom and dad believe it or not uh didn't have the  most ideal marriage either and uh and uh my dad pretty much got as far away from my mom that he 
[02:37:30]  could in the continental united states uh and it was she bad mouthed him a lot which just made me want  to go out there and live with it it sounded great what an asshole he chases women he drinks  this is fantastic i'm gonna face my life on this so uh so you you you still talk to him oh yeah yeah  but you think he's like you can't be happy with what he did yeah you get over it all right she never got 
[02:38:00]  over it never that's good okay now let's see what happens over what do you got top that yeah i don't know  if i can what did your dad do oh my dad oh cross dresser no my dad's uh i like to wear women's  clothing yes not quite not quite he's a very large man he's a very much a guy's guy uh i grew up with  a bunch of brothers nagel what's that i thought his name was nagel nail no it's paul huh 
[02:38:30]  uh yay uh she doesn't get any of these jokes she's new to the she's new to the program yeah  she's never heard the show before no and she was the second choice of the friend yeah yeah  what did i miss uh oh wow character let's recap 20 years of wonderfulness character um yeah uh so so  he's a large man a large man uh still married to your mom yes they're still married uh miserable no he had  a wife he had a wife before he met my mom oh okay this is a little evilness any family any you have 
[02:39:00]  any half brothers yeah i have two half brothers half brothers do they want to you what anthony  anthony i just say what everyone thinks wow that's terrible the question is have they  uh no no one of them is gay so no oh well jimmy yeah oh wow okay that's i know i know 
[02:39:30]  oh okay so that is your your dad can't be uh um happy with that i'm not saying it's a bad thing i'm just  saying most dads don't want the thought of their son getting a big dick in their ass it's uh yeah  greek we're greek ah okay you're greek it's kind of mandatory it's a sexy national yeah yep comes with  the flag yeah yeah oh okay are you 100 greek yeah yeah oh cool wow have you 
[02:40:00]  all right you know the stereotype i remember the first first time i heard the term greek was my  friend dean miller who taught me he was a little older and more advanced than i was and um he told  me about getting greeked and i'm like what's that mean he's like well just go home and tell your mom  that you want to get greeked so at home i was telling my mom i really want to get greeked or i 
[02:40:30]  want to greek somebody she called in your dad wow did she know what you meant of course wow  apparently she was a better egg than i thought  oh all right so uh is she answering that question or yeah she doesn't have a big second family  is she answering the greek question there's something going on there before he met my mom 
[02:41:00]  and then they uh ran away and got eloped and they've been pretty happy ever since did you ever have the  feeling that he feels more strongly for the first family than you oh no no we actually uh all get  along pretty well but uh he's uh he's got a pretty nasty angry greek temper which can be pretty funny  sometimes oh really funny oh she says it's funny yeah that's funny as she's in tears yeah as he's  throwing people out of the diner yeah too early too early you want the peas carrots yeah 
[02:41:30]  brings home those dumb baskets with the pickles and coleslaw in it hey pickle coleslaw you want  really good yeah oh okay so well that's not really anything you win that one oh you should  answer the other question yeah terrible he was asking about the greek thing either girl want to  answer that what's that it's that's acceptable i think people know that oh you're understood no but

[02:53:00]  like why not you know my buddies were like hey we were listening he was like you know they were  telling me like you know chris you snap more than you realize and i was like no i don't and then i  they were like you know you do and then i started like getting like really aggravated you were ready to  snap expectations i was like i'm gonna fucking put somebody in a coma right now all i want is ham  but that's always the best response to that you know you have an anger problem what the  fuck does that mean what are you fucking even talking about yeah wow that's uh yeah you know 
[02:53:30]  i'm one of those guys who uh like i i just i guess maybe you want people to like you know me or  something like that or and i just feel like i hold a lot of shit in like a lot of shit bothers me like  about some of the things my friends say or i just never say anything i'm like no i don't want to  cause an argument you look like you're having a nice day i don't want to ruin this but then i go home  and i fucking brush my teeth to my gums bleed you know i'm fucking i'm trying to wiggle my teeth out  i'm squeezing soap you know i just sit on the toilet i don't even have to shit i just want to squeeze 
[02:54:00]  you got a lot of that you'll keep it inside yeah but i never like have snapped snapped besides the  baseball baseball and the chair and the chair but it was 9 11.  it was 9 11 and the other guy fouled me yeah yeah yeah yeah we understand yeah the other but  other hand i'll never no i i don't like to fight yeah yeah well obviously yeah i find that as i get  older like if i get in a fight with my girlfriend obviously there's no bats or chairs i don't know  what happened here earlier but uh but but i i'm literally too old for it like we get into a yelling 
[02:54:30]  thing where because she'll go at it with me like yeah yeah there's you know there's a couple kinds  of women they're the kinds that cry quickly and then the ones where it takes some time uh and like  so so we fight and she's yelling and i'm yelling and it's like joe pesci in that scene from uh from  casino where he's kicking the guy and just gotta take a break yeah he's like oh yeah like literally  it's like i'm screaming i'm like i gotta sit down i i got no more i'm too old for this yeah yeah it's 
[02:55:00]  ridiculous and i'm exhausted the next day and she's like what's the matter i'm like i'm you're  gonna kill me i'm dying from this yeah and that's why i love her at the when i fight with a chick it's  like pesci from jfk she pulls off her blonde wig and i realize it's just a bald guy a terrible  fucking weakness that crying part is the that's the a fork in the argument road right there when she  cries she starts crying the original argument becomes like it morphs into something else no 
[02:55:30]  no then there's no argument anymore right then you just become an apology monster because like oh yeah  yeah right as soon as they cry then they're there it's a different issue like you're an animal and  you know you're an and there's no the argument has no bearing on anything then you're it's just  packing clothes things are being loaded it's horrible yeah yeah and then you have to and i've  talked about this before having sex on a pile of clothing that's been taken out of drawers to leave  you with is the best wow yeah very everything depends on it it's very important jesus that's 
[02:56:00]  cutting it close it's a metaphor it is a metaphor oh really people like these guys are like what's  fucking wrong with him anthony makes his girlfriend cry wow yeah you're good  uncle paul i want to say i fight less we fight less i fight less with this one than i ever have  and it's getting much better everything's good it's just because you're resigning yourself to the fact  that you know i have to enough already right yeah why jump in sometimes and get into just take 
[02:56:30]  it a brawl yeah yeah just yeah i wish i wish my girl would start shit with people because when she  doesn't then i hear about it for an hour like if she if something happens you know like that guy's  a fucking ass did you see what he did i mean it's it's entertaining but and it's probably better  that she doesn't start shit but a lot of times like the discussion of how much of an asshole someone  is based on one interaction right like you know he didn't say thank you that's an hour that we're  going to talk about that the assessment of that situation that sounds like a problem no no it's  it's all right it's entertaining yeah then i don't have to talk and just listen and go okay yeah oh 
[02:57:00]  yeah what an asshole it's horrible that guy do you feel like mark do you feel like your girl ever like  provokes you like like i feel like my girl like if i miss something yeah like she'll let me know like  oh that guy just said i had a nice ass you know and i'm just like well i didn't see it so would  you want me to go back yeah and then i feel like if i don't like there was one like uh last week  i guess a guy was hitting on her i didn't realize it and she was like you just when we got back she  was like you just let that guy hit on me i was like what i thought you guys were talking like  human beings do you want me to go fucking fine what do you want me to do and then she just gets 
[02:57:30]  me charged up yeah and then you know it's just a fucking blowout fight right and then with her  with her yeah yeah well i mean the provoking jealousy thing that's a that's a nightmare because  yeah that oh that doesn't happen a lot but you know it's when you don't give them enough attention  they're like then they say something like you know guys they hit on me too they they do all the time  and you're like what do you mean all the time well you just don't notice it what are you talking  about and then all of a sudden you're in it and then uh yeah and then i'm maybe they're delusional  i don't know what this comes from yeah but i every time that happens with us when we fight like that 
[02:58:00]  and we have makeup sex yeah i never pull out yeah you want so you want to have it you want to have  an anger baby yeah it's like something like it's something like i just want i'm like i just want to  fucking you know i it's like a weird thing and she's she's brought it up to me because she's not on the  pill and yeah you know yeah we just pull out and you know and every time this happens i'm just  fucking you know i'm just like i'm gonna come inside of you she's like no don't i'm gonna  fucking do it yeah and then i do it and then we're fucking you know plan you're worried it's a good 
[02:58:30]  story for a kid you went the night you were conceived i wanted to kill your mother yeah i was killing her  with my cock when you happen and i'm saying that through a fucking glass window in prison  she's holding up the baby there's another thing that that look that a girlfriend will give you  when you ask her a question or say something and you realize from the look it's like oh no she she  told me this before oh yeah like i yeah i've asked i'm asking her a question she obviously told me this 
[02:59:00]  and i was just not paying attention to listening like the question is do you mind if i my ex  you know she's addressed and you get a look like and then you go like oh  and then you just start rattling through your head and cannot remember what she was  rambling on and babbling about like we're supposed to pick up the tidbits of real information  in that inane droning babble wow there's a lot of love there and yeah come on or wait what's worse 
[02:59:30]  i don't know like is when i know that happens on my side where i'll tell her something she's like  i know you told me this before oh and then you just feel like a stupid old guy that i mean that's  the oh no you never want to do the worst the old guy thing is it's never going to go away she's  20 years younger than me so i'm doomed and it's just never going to go away the old guy thing is  just it's a it's a constant thing every day you wake up and you're like i'm so lucky i'm dying  you know like it's like i can't uh yeah that's the biggest problem nothing's sexier uh in front 
[03:00:00]  of a younger girl than having to pull out your reading glasses right and having them low on your  nose as you look up at her oh yeah what excuse me oh it's just so sexy i bet the worst thing the  worst thing is when they when she hovers right here and she looks at the side of my head we got  to do your ears that yeah that's why don't you just whisper you're old oh my god nothing better  than looking at that multi-colored nail polish on chewed up fingernails running it through your  gray chest hairs it's uh it's a treat it's your hand 
[03:00:30]  uh sam handed a note we got a break unfortunately what just because a lot of  sam's a killjoy no kidding so we'll take a break and we'll hang out yeah we'll take a break mark  marron's here you sticking around mark yeah yeah yeah enough for 20 minutes all right we'll talk  about the second season of the tv show congrats on that yeah yeah very happy for you thank you very  much of course colin quinn is here and uh chris uh de stefano you sticking around sure and we got 
[03:01:00]  another comic in the audience wants to say hi that jay moore turned me on to oh the little fella  what that's not a nice way jesus christ what the fuck i don't know it just doesn't seem right  guy oh i thought you meant me oh jimmy all right we'll be back live in montreal at the just for laughs  live from the world's largest comedy festival just for laughs montreal  this is the opian anthony show more more more news 
[03:01:30]  the opian anthony show continues  live from just for laughs montreal  we are back live from montreal just for last festival  we got mark mark marron on the couch yeah we got colin quinn yes we got chris uh de stefano and we 
[03:02:00]  got a old guy uh sitting on the couch and he just takes a seat we didn't even we didn't even say take  no intro nothing no why not i i i figure it's the ona show midgets are a great accessory oh that's so  politically incorrect i was telling anthony he can say it no it's called burdens yeah  teasing of course i was telling anthony i was telling anthony during the commercial that mud  uh midgets are just fun right just talking to you was kind of just fun right when is a midget  ever around where you're like fuck my life i hate this no never you see a midget you're happy 
[03:02:30]  it doesn't matter you get fired from your job honey your wife is cheating on you walk down the street  you see me you're like yeah are you okay with the m word are you all right with the m word i've been  protested because i say the m word because i say them really oh really i was doing a comedy club  uh oh by the way my name is brad williams hi brad williams hi hi what's up uh jay moore turned me  on to you jay moore yeah tweets me one day and says you guys just you got to follow him he's really funny  i'm like all right if jay says so i guess i have to follow me on twitter at funny brad thanks uh and 
[03:03:00]  funny brad yeah brad williams was taken i was drunk i was like well i'm funny i'll work out it's like  it's stupid but whatever uh i was i was in detroit michigan and i was doing a show at a comedy club  called joey's comedy club up there yeah and uh 24 midgets came out to protest me with the picket  signs and everything that's adorable yeah i know right i'm like did you did you is it really a protest  well did you know what was happening when one parking spot got taken up 
[03:03:30]  like is it really a protest of the entire thing could be blocked by a mini cooper driving by  so yeah protesting their own yeah because it's like because they're saying like you you say midget  and they did the whole and i know it's kind of a a hack bit but they they're like so when you call  a dwarf a midget it's the exact same as calling a black person the n-word oh boy and i'm just like  midget please no like it's not like like because black that's totally different because like black 
[03:04:00]  people had to go through slavery which was terrible but like midgets were never slaves because  we would have been the worst slaves on the planet you know slave fetch me that jar second shelf boss  you're yeah like what can i ask you a question yeah fire away the so so what what is the appropriate uh  is it the dwarf is okay or is there a difference between a dwarf and a midget uh yeah technically like  we like being called dwarves or little people but to me those words kind of sound kind of  little people sounds bad we like that sounds like you're just a little person yeah you are 
[03:04:30]  but you're okay with dwarf yeah that's because we have dwarfism so it's kind of like i like dwarf  i'll go with that yeah you'll go with what but like to me that's kind of like  mark we've gone with kickables  that's the word we use on the show that's the type of show you're on bro kickable we call them  kickables that's awesome oh god yeah i don't know but like dwarf to me has kind of like the fairy  tale yeah connotation like you hear oh he's a dwarf you're gonna walk on the radio just hi 
[03:05:00]  ho like something like that but so what is midget what's wrong with midget though oh it's got some  like carnival references but to me to me it doesn't sound bad it almost sounds french like fancy like my  friend is a mishay yeah i like that what uh now when you walk on stage you're uh yeah you know  obviously visually everybody knows okay he's small so what point when you're doing material  does it become like okay i gotta talk about it because you have to address it you can just talk  about other things and not yeah at all reference that well because when when i first started doing 
[03:05:30]  stand-up i was just doing like observational what's going on in the news and i didn't mention it at  all and i noticed the audience was just looking at me like does he know but so then i i i have to  address it at first but yeah then then we move on to other topics but yeah you do have to satisfy  that part of the crowd's desire of knowledge and yeah uh it's funny i did a gig one time where literally  i haven't even said anything in the microphone yet and uh this woman was uh terrified of little people 
[03:06:00]  she has something called microphobia which is a real my brother has that for real like like  yeah he gets freaked out when he sees midgets yeah and like people like that's not real no because  no it's real uh her friends were all fans of mine and they thought it would be an absolute hoot  if they brought her to my show sat in the front row and did not tell her who the comedian was that night  so i so i walk on stage before he even grabbed the microphone this woman just stands up and goes  jesus christ and you said he obviously doesn't exist 
[03:06:30]  see him move his arms that was really weird anyone else knows how weird that arm movement was  jim jim did a dwarf arm movement yeah i liked how jim i loved how you tucked in your arms like let's  little added t-rex i didn't even mean to do that that was not intentional it's just i become the  character wait so what what is that phobia about do you know have you researched it well because well here's  here's the deal is i think it changes from person to person but i asked this woman at the show why 
[03:07:00]  are you afraid of little people and this was her honest to god response said why are you afraid she  goes every time i see a little person i just know they're gonna rape me now look at her like and then  you raped her why would they well out of spite right how dare her for being right i can see if they said  how come you every time you see a little person with a ladder yeah yeah it's like i i can't it's  impossible there's no like it like really you're afraid of this like it's it's not contagious yeah 
[03:07:30]  i can't walk up to you scratch you in the knee and you go i'm melting that doesn't happen all right  i gotta ask uh about the hog the what the hog oh midgets have yeah yeah regular pieces what's what's  going on yeah uh well he see here's the best part is that it's regular it's it's average size but on  me it looks fucking okay okay my cock hangs down on my knees yeah so literally yeah like i can  legitimately say me yeah yeah it's it's nice little feather in the cat i think with with the dwarves which 
[03:08:00]  i enjoy um i like how he says dwarves like it's a summer salad i enjoy a waldorf dwarf  no but i think the reason people freak out is because it's you don't see a lot of you sure and  and and when you do like it's sort of like a car accident you know when you have to look right you  have to look but everything everything becomes very very immediate you know what i mean like when you see  a a little person it's like holy shit there is right there yeah and everything becomes very 
[03:08:30]  immediate and you kind of the whole time the whole like uh everything revolves around you for  a second sure what what's ridiculous is that i've realized that the only stereotypes about little  people are fantastical stereotypes like we make cookies with chocolate live in a tree all that  some of you can fly correct correct absolutely yeah so then i i feel like whatever i do when  people are looking at me that's what people think like all midgets do like if i'm walking  out and i'm like eating a twinkie like oh midgets love twinkies that's their thing like they do that 
[03:09:00]  uh what i think the sad thing is is it's always going to be entertaining for other people no matter  what you could be having the worst day of your life or have a limp or something but they're gonna  be like yeah look at that guy yeah you should do things that aren't conducive with what you who you  are but just to fucking annoy like just to give people the wrong impression once you are to walk  into a room just going oh that that reminds me saint patrick's day is the scariest 
[03:09:30]  damn i i never go out on saint patrick's day because i i know i'm just gonna go out to the  bar some guys gonna stop drinking look at me go he knows where it is yeah yeah hey what kind  of cereal you like i i can't buy lucky charms without people like i'm going oh that's funny like no  it's delicious cereal asshole say it right say it right magically magically delicious  duket list cross that off brad you go to the conventions i i i do go to the conventions it looks 
[03:10:00]  like it's a fuck fest it it really is wait wait dwarf conventions yeah i i watch you guys didn't know  about this i watch the little people big world i love the fucking show sure you've never been on it  though no they should have you well yeah they don't really like me too much either why a bunch of  midgets don't like me because i say midgets a lot i say midgets and get some more work  people mcnugget oh no conventions they get together you're trying to find wives and  shit because there's not other uh little people in their in their hometown but they mostly go to try  to find yeah your brother's terrified of midgets and you're obsessed with them yeah yeah is that 
[03:10:30]  fucked up i got he had a midget terrify him in uh in uh an old volkswagen bus when we were really  young wait how does what the midget just starts circling the car because he knew my brother was  freaked out and he was walking around the car that's all he did that vw bus just walking around  all he did and my brother was completely freaked out that's all the experience i love that midget for  doing that yeah so tell us about the conventions it's sorry it is a damn orgy like you go there 
[03:11:00]  and everyone's just like and that is great because we could fit more of us in a bed it's  fucking awesome uh but really like you're going there just just to hook up because like you say  you we're not around a lot so then we all gather in one hotel by the way shitty hotels is there a name  for it when uh lpa little uh little people of america for when midgets fuck show on discovery channel now  there is actually the technical word is oh yeah 
[03:11:30]  but that convention is open to to regular people too right yeah because i have a regular people i  know you almost said real people didn't you the normal people open to human beings not  so uh uh not god's mistakes they can come to no i got a friend who's banged like three midgets  oh so oh so he's got the fetish he's been to the convention yeah i bet he has he absolutely  yeah his name is rich voss um yeah yeah well the old bet that in whatever convention we're doing 
[03:12:00]  we always have it in a big hotel and i'm always like fearful of the people that are just staying  in that hotel just as a regular vacation like they're just coming in and they walk out of the  elevator totally hung over there's a thousand midgets in the damn lobby they're like what the  hell did i drink last night yeah i have a question for you too um sure about uh oh  shit i forgot what it was oh no oh do other uh midgets or dwarves or do they see you as kind of like  the way a black guy would see the guy who was dancing down the steps with shirley temple like tom 
[03:12:30]  yeah like literally he's an uncle tom thumb  oh yes yes oh yeah that's the name of my next album right there oh that is  fucking hilarious great that's great uh some is that why they dislike some do yeah some do but then  uh they either fall on two different sides of the midget spectrum uh it's either they hate me 
[03:13:00]  or they just like they think i'm like a god of some kind it's insane yeah buscemi said in a movie  there was a movie buscemi did and there was a scene with a dwarf and they would the dwarf was  annoyed going how do you think every time there's a dream sequence i'm in it like just talking about  all these shitty things about that they put dwarves in and like after a point doesn't it get to be  irritating like we get it well sure that's why it's so cool to see uh guys like uh dinklage on uh on  uh game of thrones she's like rock star now yes the one guy yeah the one guy it's nice to know i 
[03:13:30]  have a billion in one shot of being famous yeah yeah yeah he was a famous yeah yeah with with all  that dialogue he had all hours oh sorry remember way to go chris way to go yeah yeah that's what you're  talking about yeah huge celebrity with no lines in that movie you would have been talking  yeah how could they have found a mini colin it wouldn't it wouldn't have worked hey you know 
[03:14:00]  oh wait was that who you were supposed to is that who you were supposed to be or no no no he was  supposed to be scott scott oh mini me well i never saw him but that guy has his own trip going on  what is he sure uh he's way shorter than you yeah you like i like he's like a foot tall would you bully  him fuck yes i would i have to know what that's like for once in my god like i just like  shit goes way down i think he's got a sickness of some kind you don't you're no he has dwarfism too 
[03:14:30]  oh it's but but it's extras there's there's over a hundred different types because it's a genetic  there's that many yeah you know do you guys like are there subgroups at the convention  where where each type gets to hang out with the types that are like them or yeah oh really yeah  there's a there's a primordial dwarfism scd i like that primordial dwarfism oh my god  they're the ones that talk like this yeah hey how you doing yeah i'm a grown man motherfucker  yeah yeah they talk how people think i should sound like because i come on the radio people 
[03:15:00]  like oh you're a midget and then it's radio so listeners are like we can't tell yeah it's not like  sounded a lot taller on the radio do you make fun of uh the midgets that are taller or shorter  but you know how like black people they have this pride that they have to be really right  right shades of black oh so like if you're over four yeah is there a thing that happens with the  midget thing yeah where you make fun of him like oh look he's not as short as us fuck him  you know what it's yeah well it's more like the short ones talk smack on the really tall ones 
[03:15:30]  oh that's what they do and i'm four foot four so believe it or not i'm like yowming to my people  yeah like he's a tall guy yeah exactly so yeah i post up we uh one of the worst moments on our radio  show we worst the best we have a lot of them we had a midget that wanted to become a stripper  and and she came in because we're you know we we consider ourselves experts especially at the time  yeah and we put her up on the console yeah and she to audition we wanted to see if she had what it

[03:18:00]  yeah tom hanks what are we doing but i want to understand how the hell did you babysit another midget  i mean how does that happen was there a midget babysitting thing that's service  site just coincidentally used to babysit another dwarf well like a lot of us uh  choice of words again uh growing up yeah uh we yeah uh we were all like we all know each other  because we all hang out we all kind of i knew it we all run the same circle yeah so when people have  kids like we understand that there's actually now a dwarf dating website i was gonna ask you if there's a 
[03:18:30]  midget app oh there is uh there is yeah it's called uh date a little dot com oh date a little  see the thing is like if if if dwarves don't want to be like it's kind of hard to get out of that  like all right we're short but if everything they do has short involved in it like sure you know what  i mean like uh big people little little people big world all right we're little everything has little  right or so it's like how do they expect to i mean maybe i think i think jim is trying to blame you

[03:21:00]  i mean you're i i was listening earlier you were saying like midget left and right it is very  mystic i don't i know i don't i don't say it though i know well i know some little people and some i  know get really offended so i just i just call them by their names which are yeah wow that's  unique oh yeah that's strange it's a very polite thing to do right yeah treat them treat them like  a real person yeah great that's the thing yeah what are you doing around these parts there judah 
[03:21:30]  uh busy doing shows doing shows yeah how is it how's the uh uh yeah they're pretty cool man yeah  there's some weird vibes in montreal what do you mean uh well i don't know there's a lot of like  unspoken sort of uh like issues that nobody wants to talk about it's like it's almost like the  trayvon martin zimmerman case but it's with french and english and what language to use oh really yeah  so it's like i feel people it's like not everyone but some people are like divided like yeah divided 
[03:22:00]  and they're so afraid of they're so polite and they're so afraid of offending anyone um that there's  never any honesty happening and it's just a weird little wow that's going on yeah they're trying  to get rid of english up here right yeah yeah so it's a little weird yeah right but it's cool you  know these guys know wow yeah yeah it's like nobody likes to talk about it you really want the english  out and then it's like oh you own the trayvon martin case that's nothing compared to what we got in  the states as far as that whole division thing oh wow they don't want to speak english right but here 
[03:22:30]  but in the united states people are a little more like if they disagree with you they might just like  yell at you and say you're an idiot where here they're like nobody's saying anything no one says  anything like a weird energy yeah well how ingrained in this culture are you i mean it's like you might  have just like you haven't how many of these discussions have you been in i've been here four  days and i've just learned a lot and i've just i'm very perceptive taking it all in yeah yeah but i started  a website and hopefully it won't get me uh banned from every comedy club but i'm starting a website 
[03:23:00]  to try to and do it in a friendly way to you know to discuss it but not making anyone the enemy but  i want to try to get rid of and i think every comic hates it uh i want to get rid of the check spot  the check drop the dropping of the checks during the show yeah and i just i just launched a free  shows for everyone no no no no but i'm saying you know dropping the checks during a show while comedy  comedians are performing all comedians hate it audiences hate it at the end of the night  uh or the comic is still on stage and you'll see the waiters and waitresses come by and start 
[03:23:30]  handing out the checks and then people start chattering about the check and they're grabbing  money and it really distracts right and you can't and you can't blame the audience because they're  getting the bill it's dark they're watching the show they're trying to watch the show they're trying  to pay their bills and it's a massive disruption that lasts anywhere from five to thirty minutes  seriously but if imagine you're going to the movies if you don't know what we're talking about it's  like going to the movies and uh with 20 minutes left the movie all of a sudden all the ushers come 
[03:24:00]  out and uh they're just giving you your checks and making you pay your bills right yeah yeah they're  like what i'm trying to watch you know yeah so what do you suggest the website is well there's a few  comedy clubs i know of in the country i know don't do that the factory doesn't do it they wait brand  the fact the stress factory does not do it uh the comedy seller does not drop checks and they do  four shows every friday and saturday and they still clear the room out and turn around in time  for the next show that's amazing but uh you know the stand does not do it um the uh the laugh factor 
[03:24:30]  in la does it a different way they make people just pay for everything they get as they go and that's  still much better than having a check spot that's good i guess i guess after the show's the best we've  taken care of you know cancer alzheimer's aids this is a good cause that you jumped on real relatable to  the ordinary person well we all know cancer and aids are uh overrated problems with the media  but uh has said that is so bad so anyways the website's called don't drop the checks during 
[03:25:00]  the show dot org and you can sign it and it just went up an hour ago who had dot com yeah  why not just i was i was gonna go dot com but i was trying to be all serious wait why not just drop  the check spot dot com well it's that also it's that also but i don't like in la like comics don't  call it uh the check spot uh they call it the check drop so and on and on the uh on the road a lot of 
[03:25:30]  comics who just do the road uh because like like in new york city there's often one comic who only gets  the spot while the checks are dropped and that's called the spot yeah and that's called the check  spot but on the road when most guys are headlining they don't call the check spot they call it uh  getting the checks dropped or whatever stinks right right so that's why uh but it's it's jock  it's uh drop the check spot dot org also it's the same website other than the other than the  comedy seller every other club that's the only way to break into the club is you're a new comic  and they say well you know what you're new we don't know who you are write some jokes about the 
[03:26:00]  checks yeah go up it's going to be hilarious go up hey what are you people paying that yeah go up and do  your best five while nobody's paying attention to you and you won't get in the club so you have to  worry about it and my thought is is like it's it's it reminds me of this whole canadian french english  thing where nobody's talking about it and and comics don't talk about it to club owners because  they fear they might get banned from it and and club owners they don't want to look like the bad guy  i'm not calling anyone the bad guy i'm like hey look let's just look at it and you know there are some 
[03:26:30]  you know there's some great comedy clubs that don't drop the checks and and they're doing fine and  their business is great and i think it's something that's like a muscular dystrophy telethon let's  give it a shot let's go to the tote board yeah so uh wow do you guys do you guys have the right  material like for the check drop spot like i have yeah of course and i'm tired of doing them yeah  like i like long story jokes that people don't really have to pay attention right they can tune  in every now and then right right but it's annoying that you have to like like any input on this call 
[03:27:00]  well i agree because it ruins the show for you i mean there's so many things comedy clubs do to ruin the  show for the crowd never mind just for the comedian right right and it's like the person  you actually came to see yeah 30 minutes into their 45 minute hour set that's when they  change the whole show every time it's bizarre because they don't care about what the show  they just care about i understand them getting the money but vinnie does it the stress factory fine  and again you're right the seller four shows a weekend and they pull it off yeah yeah and uh  the other thing is i think you know not having dropping checks during the show will make it uh 
[03:27:30]  the comedian be able to do an even better show yeah the audience will be happier and a happier  audience is going to lead to more money wow repeat business that's why he's the world champion  every more money there it is and it's easier for a wait staff to get the bills paid if they're not  trying to whisper to people during the show and then they can you know when the show's over the  lights are up it's easier easier to pay bills i like yelling this checks outlandish yeah  no but you gotta you gotta get jokes for it like i'll say like like i'll say something like look 
[03:28:00]  at this guy's going who ordered the tax i didn't have the tax oh that's a good one oh yeah every time  where was that guy from what was that dialect that was um who owed the tax yeah that's kind of like  attack on the french canadians yeah no i was kind of a french jewish old man new york  jack of all trades guy i um i had i have something here that i was uh playing around with i don't 
[03:28:30]  know i don't know if you could hear it but what what what what does this say let me see  it's killing it's killing it's killing do it again that's cool do it again all right let me let  me see see see i was using that last night because it sounds like something that could be legit for

[03:57:00]  anal sex that's right which is uh a wonderful thing and then we have uh kelly yeah from toronto  from toronto who came here alone flew here and that's like a guaranteed fuck yeah because  not necessarily what i think of the show i think kelly's here for business kelly's here for business  i think right for why because she's an accountant no oh no she's here for pleasure she's here for your 
[03:57:30]  cat kid oh it just if she's willing to go this far just to see this show she probably  fuck someone from this show i would think right am i right yeah uh so we got some daddy issues  over here that's me right she is our father left when she was 19 years old it's not bad just abandoned  the family what's wrong with that he was cheating on mom oh and stuff it just shows this thing that 
[03:58:00]  she probably felt if i was good enough and my dad loved me even if he was miserable marriage he would  stay here with me please so it's father rejection which which my dicks can sniff out like a a pig smelling  truffles  except dirtier than the pig  yes 19 but you're saying that didn't happen until she was 19 is that what you said yeah that's 
[03:58:30]  that's that's come on that's still you could you sit in a more effeminate manner uh joe's  joe's legs are beautifully crossed they really are uh yeah so that there's there's a daddy issue  there which is pretty it's a lot easier to fuck girls with daddy issues can they stand up but the  greek thing is really they're on the couch they're very they're both very lovely girls why don't we bring  them up yeah bring the girls up let's get up here ladies let's kick the midget off the couch for  oh my god oh come on i am kickable come right up here yeah you gotta jump off the

[03:59:30]  anything else to add to the dating they look extremely uncomfortable they both have no they're  they're cool they're fine both have nice feet can i ask you something are you wearing panties yes i am  fuck i thought i saw a hair this looks like the game this looks like the game of thrones over here  now  i couldn't think of anything it was a great setup though just to catch you up it was the most  uninspired fucking dating game questions none of us had anything they were you're right we had  nothing well i didn't i was the worst dating game ever i happen to be very good at the dating game well 
[04:00:00]  today we're not all right none of us were yeah jimmy any uh final questions or the ladies want to say  something well i could ask maybe if either one of them might have any type of a physical or sexual  attraction for me that might make a decision easier i would ask if they had it for chris first  and then find off no because where their standards are i would never cock block chris but he does have  a girlfriend he's fucking ah cock blocked right there you know by saying he had a girlfriend absolutely 
[04:00:30]  hey uh so do you girls have any attraction to jimmy it's okay if you don't but i just want to know  like i don't want to are you wearing are you wearing blue panties with white dots on it why  are you looking up her skirt yes she is why wouldn't i do you have a repulsion that's an attraction  i'd say as long as chip doesn't come to lunch we're good oh that might be impossible how about if i come  on lunch that's not sexy i'll fucking tug my pekka right on your meatloaf 
[04:01:00]  chip is so smooth with the ladies oh jesus and the girl that never saw the show is looking at him like  this yeah yeah what i don't get it i don't get it just comes out yeah yeah okay so uh have you have  you ever just on a whim gone gone out with a guy that you've just met like minutes before yeah yeah you  have yeah both of you can i ask a question to you what a couple of hoes hey i know i know right do you 
[04:01:30]  do you and the camera guy shop at the same store oh oh they're both wearing a little scarf both wearing  scarves kind of whoosh it french why are you wearing those scarves every day man because of their  throats you look like the btk he's pointing at the ceiling he's gonna he's gonna hang himself  i get cold with the rafters you get cold you look like they gotta try to arnold on different strokes 
[04:02:00]  yeah finally one of your 30 year old show references pays off  finally you look like colonel potter's roommate  what are you talking about you had a sandy duncan yesterday all right well you know what  can i ask can i ask this girl a question she said something very interesting just that you  said you have gone out with a guy like minutes after meeting him yeah if you don't mind if i 
[04:02:30]  asked that did it get physical in that immediate day he punched her in the face  seriously did it get physical at all it was just a friendly lunch kind of  can i ask you a question this is for both of you if you're at a guy's house you come back after dinner  not for sex just to come back and maybe have a drink or an espresso and um you get back and  you go hey can i use the bathroom you go into the bathroom and there's plastic all on the floor  neatly placed would you uh a sit down and continue to pee or or would you leave would that scare you 
[04:03:00]  to make you leave jesus how the fuck are you getting like plastic just on the floor yeah just on the  floor no on the floor it's just on the floor just on the floor yeah yeah something's being set up  don't just stare at it eat it probably let him question it too much you wouldn't question it at  all i don't know but he's one other thing he starts playing he starts playing huey lewis in the movie  yeah yeah tell you how great they are i can sold nail gun to the back of your head 
[04:03:30]  something like that that says a lot about her would you leave oh i might give it 10 minutes yeah  jesus it says a lot about these girls they definitely have issues can you ask about the  kelly's a goer i think kelly's the goer in this but although i don't know well she's asking about  the plastic jimmy you want to tell her about the plastic or no i just i just i sometimes will lay  down plastic because one time i was walking into the bathroom and a girl was urinating i didn't know  she was urinating i tripped and fell and when she was trying to help me up she kept urinating and all 
[04:04:00]  of a sudden it got all over me and then i paid her 300 that was that was a bob kelly set up an  assist by op and a home run by fucking little jimmy yeah it looked like a triple play right  beautiful a fucking dunk well i don't know just now you don't have you you can be very honest  do you is there any attraction because if there's not an attraction i respect it if you 
[04:04:30]  if you don't feel it yes how about a microphone no you don't have to answer it you can be honest  she's be honest be honest yeah you can see yes but i do think that yes i think that since kelly drove  in from all the way from toronto she's a bigger fan that she deserves it more oh she's  trooper trooper she's pointing you off no she's being nice no she's plotting no it's not it's not  exactly she's basically saying kelly deserves chlamydia 
[04:05:00]  everybody everybody no if she was jimmy if she was totally into you she wouldn't even  fucking like for a second try to say nah she probably is a bigger fan no that's not true with  canada we're very we're played they're really nice oh that's right that's horse  shit that was a political move i agree yes i agree too that's what i was saying  judas dude is fucking proving himself right here yeah do you like jimmy or not is what 
[04:05:30]  jimmy wants to ask i do i do i just feel bad because this is the first time i'm not as bad as  you're gonna be a show and i don't she's a huge fan yeah but she didn't come god a little honesty  dude that's all we're asking for honest a little fucking honest yeah now she's getting jimmy joe get  your dumb long hands out of my face she's gonna go i don't know the ambivalence is making you in her  now you dirty did you think that was political that that was a pawn off of the other chick aren't you  no think of how you'd feel if the situation was reversed there's two you're you and another guy and a 
[04:06:00]  hot chick or something well a disgusting pig uh is sitting here is sitting here and she if she  was if you were into the girl you wouldn't try to pawn her off on the guy sitting next to you  no how do you would no yes no but here's the difference uh uh she came with her friend  and uh you know she doesn't want to just come in and say well this girl's a big fan i've never  been to the show take the insult as you should no she doesn't like you doesn't find you i think  she does i think she wants to stick her feet in my mouth what the girl oh the girl who's 
[04:06:30]  the big fan what's your answer with your attraction at a boy june a way to bring it home as long as  it's not chip we're good okay cool that's that's an answer yeah so you think you think you find jimmy  attractive i like jimmy and without oh and without anything without saying anything is there any  possible inkling for a little romance it doesn't have to be sex i just a little romance and by romance  we mean you coming right oh i can tell you there's no chance of either of them coming 
[04:07:00]  hang on one second if you hey little guy if you ever grab the mic like that again i'm gonna push  you off the couch oh he didn't he didn't know he thought it was just turn it back  any chance a little romance maybe sure maybe yeah sure so you're because right but no some  girls are like you know no there's no chance just lunch and that but you're open uh to anything yeah 
[04:07:30]  she said yes because she locked it in what are you doing can i ask a question to either both of  you you and you what's your favorite porno to watch what's what style of porn yeah that's what i said  this group what talking to the microphone yeah i don't know you don't watch porn not really okay hang  on wow what's yours i know i have the same answer i don't know oh so you both lie i'm not you're both liars  unless you don't watch porn because you're too busy we made it this far that's a bad  fucking answer oh so neither one of you likes it that much what don't you like about it let me 
[04:08:00]  ask you both what don't you like about it it's depersonalizing i never said i didn't like it i just  it's like i can't name you like titles or no no no what style though no no i didn't ask you which  godfather you liked better i'm talking about what style yeah do you like like lesbians girl on girl  do you like blow-bang interracial yeah she-mail cum shots up your ass hand chops  jizz by the way yeah mom on mom mom daughter daughter son mom you guys are just naming 
[04:08:30]  mormon you guys are just naming everything that happens in every porno you're just like anal cum  tits they're all the categories from every one of these sites you go to yeah yeah yeah  we we yeah i have a question what has either one of you ever had a threesome oh oh is jimmy trying  the ultimate score no no i know how about a two and a half some 
[04:09:00]  nice how about how we use brad as an extra penis yeah exactly a three-foot some  yeah just know when jimmy answers you go get a foot long he doesn't mean brad  have you ever had a threesome the subway joke threesome  that's a yes that's a yes yeah you don't have to think about it well she's thinking not  intentionally maybe whoa what happened but it's also montreal so that's not uncommon again judah 
[04:09:30]  yeah really see what were you fucking this is this is one of the most perceptive people i  fucking know that is he hit this nail right on the head yeah i didn't even notice this it's like  a conspiracy it's a form of pc stuff yes but not with specific words but with just not a communication  in general right yeah yeah this is so that's why the transportation department stinks they  fucked up our rides this morning oh yeah again they're terrible they say no i'd be here they're  terrible i would be here in the festival's transportation department is horrendous yeah 
[04:10:00]  yeah what about uh you anything well i'll try to answer directly i'm an accountant so i'll let  you guess what my answer is no wow doesn't mean no though um doesn't mean no really that's a very  tough choice one plus one plus one i think it's time i've heard of it i've heard of it yeah trying to  put it in terminology this is not necessarily a good dating game maybe the audience might have an  opinion on it we could give them a vote because i i think both are very beautiful why don't we like 
[04:10:30]  that too yeah yeah oh you think it's a bad idea huh you should let us vote only because it's hard  to choose because i don't know either one of you you're both hot shut up you gotta go you gotta go  this fucking thing out this is ridiculous it's a big listen it's a dark deal already you got it  you know there's a there's a girl that flew in yeah it's obvious you gotta go with kelly it's  yeah it's kelly it's kelly quinn's losing his mind i love it look at him don't be silly jim  you weren't here for the question the dating game it was horrendous and there was your answer right
