<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts self-aggrandizingly proclaiming their show's superiority before pivoting to a satirical commentary on the Long Island Railroad's extensive delays caused by a fire in an outdated switching station.  They mockingly contrasted the constant fare increases with the lack of infrastructure improvements. This segued into a discussion of the unusually warm late August weather in New York City, and complaints about poorly maintained roads riddled with potholes, juxtaposing this infrastructural neglect with the rapid technological advancements in automobiles.

A substantial portion of the show was devoted to a news report claiming Adolf Hitler might have had Jewish and African ancestry based on DNA testing of relatives. The hosts reacted with derisive humor and offensive jokes about Hitler's potential ethnicity,  extending this to a lengthy, offensive commentary on Michael Jordan's mustache, which they felt resembled Hitler's.

The planned construction of a mosque near Ground Zero was then heavily discussed, with the hosts expressing vehemently negative opinions using highly offensive language. They previewed an upcoming interview with guest Pete Dominick, who held a pro-mosque stance.  Their dislike for Mayor Bloomberg and his handling of the situation was also made clear.  A humorous interlude involved one host recounting a teenage experience running a makeshift pregnancy test service at home. The recall of half a billion eggs due to salmonella contamination followed, with speculation about disgruntled employees as a possible cause.

The show next covered Lindsay Lohan's release from rehab and move to New York City.  A clip of Ving Rhames discussing "hood rules" was played and commented upon, along with further offensive jokes and speculation about Prince Poppycock's performance on America's Got Talent and his sexuality. The movie *Piranha* received a brief mention.

Further discussion of Prince Poppycock's performance, described with vulgar language and speculation about his potential stardom,  followed.  This was contrasted with the perceived talent of a young opera singer, with Poppycock predicted as more likely to succeed due to his showmanship.  A viral video, "Red Toyota Truck Crashes," from FridayFile.com (formerly Ogrish/LiveLeak), depicting a seemingly immigrant-filled truck crash, was analyzed, with the hosts and a caller, Jimmy James, ultimately deeming it fake due to inconsistencies. Technical difficulties with the show's internet connection were also noted.

The controversy surrounding the Ground Zero mosque re-emerged,  featuring multiple audio clips of Reverend Al Sharpton, interspersed with the hosts' and caller Pete Dominick's frequently vulgar opinions. Dominick's input focused on the political and national security implications,  with disagreements with the hosts on whether public anti-Islam sentiment hindered counterterrorism.  The discussion involved the complexities of radicalization, socioeconomic factors, and perceived hypocrisy in Muslim reactions to Western actions.  Gene Simmons' 61st birthday received a brief mention, recalling a past interaction involving a banana.

The Ground Zero mosque debate continued, expanding to a broader discussion of American exceptionalism and foreign policy, with strong opinions expressed on US military presence abroad and the need for alternative energy sources. Heated debate about the mosque's location and the actions of some Muslim leaders continued. The show explored perceptions of Islam in America, including views attributed to CIA and military personnel on the US role in 9/11 and the prevalence of radical views within the Muslim community.  A caller, identifying as a former CIA agent, engaged in a contentious exchange, challenging the hosts' assertions. Another caller, a veteran of multiple Iraq and Afghanistan tours, offered his perspective, highlighting both anti-American sentiment and internal issues within Islam.  A 9/11 first responder also called in, sharing their emotional perspective.  A humorous, rambling interview with comedian Oscar, filled with inconsistent and nonsensical opinions, including racist remarks targeting Asian drivers, concluded this segment. Pete Dominick's Twitter follower count became a running gag throughout.

A segment largely focused on the in-studio, seemingly intoxicated comedian Oscar unfolded. The hosts, along with Jim Norton, engaged in a rambling conversation, beginning with their dislike of Norton due to his sweating.  Oscar recounted improbable stories, including an elevator incident, his views on the Ground Zero Mosque, and his alcohol consumption, including admitting to drunk driving and describing his homemade "jungle juice."  He shared anecdotes about drunk driving, fixing a plumbing leak with Poxy, his car preferences, his views on *iCarly*, and his preferences for child actresses (prompting accusations of pedophilia which he denied).  He also expressed racial biases against Asians, and discussed bed bug removal methods involving gasoline. He described himself as a "functioning alcoholic."  A largely incoherent story about a party and a woman undergoing chemotherapy was shared, interspersed with interruptions from the hosts and Norton. A listener challenged Oscar's elevator story, leading to a debate on elevator mechanics.  The segment concluded with further digressions about Halloween costumes and Oscar's experiences in Atlantic City and Wildwood. Jim Norton plugged his own show at the end.

The final segment began with a host struggling to remember promotional information for "Jim Norton Obsessed" on "The Boneyard."  This transitioned into a discussion of Tiger Woods' divorce, speculation about its details, and a graphic description of one host's feces.  A commercial break was fumbled.  Following the break, Elin Nordegren's *People* magazine interview was discussed, analyzing her perspective on the divorce and the 2009 car crash.  The possibility of Elin creating a brand ("Elan") was also considered.  A lengthy, rambling exchange between a host and Brian Williams, revealed to be a guest, about his late-night television appearances (Leno vs. Letterman) followed, including impersonations and disagreements about the merits of each show.  The segment ended with humorous banter, including a misremembered home run call and further discussion of Tiger Woods.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  It's entertaining as fuck.  How many people are screaming at their radios right now? 
[00:00:30]  It doesn't get better than this.  It's just the stupidest, most fun.  I can't get enough of this.  I would eat your poo.  You know, let's be honest with each other.  No one's doing better radio than this.  We rule Google it.  You're fucking right.  Simple as that.  Fucking believe it.  This is radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Let's get the blah on the blah.  We just did that.  Hello. 
[00:01:00]  I want to say good morning to everyone that has to take a bus into New York City today.  Yeah.  I'm watching the news here in New York.  And the Long Island Railroad is fucked.  Delays could continue for several days.  What happened?  I guess they had a switching station that caught fire.  Wow.  They had some old, old gear in there.  Yeah.  It's coming out.  Their cables are from 1925. 
[00:01:30]  And Anthony just made a good point.  You're telling me from 1925 to now, which is what, 2010?  Yeah.  They couldn't replace those cables.  Really?  All the rate increases over the years.  All the money everybody's paid into the fucking railroad.  And they couldn't just replace something from 1925.  Seems like that's pretty important.  Yeah.  To the trains running smoothly.  They're constantly crying poverty.  Where the fuck is the money going? 
[00:02:00]  I don't know.  If it's not going to fix their crumbling infrastructure, where's the money going?  It's lining their pockets.  Horrible delays at Penn Station.  Yeah.  I was telling Ed, imagine going up to a ticket booth and going, hey, I think you should take  some money off my monthly fucking card here, because the service isn't running up to my  standards.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were laughing at you.  But God forbid, you know, you jump on a train last minute, they'll give you, what, 
[00:02:30]  a $10 surcharge for buying the ticket on the train?  On the train.  It never works in your favor.  Only in their favor.  Of course.  Fucking asshole.  So now there's people, you know, marching on to buses this morning.  Buses.  That's not what you paid for.  It's bad enough to take a train.  I mean, any public transportation blows.  But to then have to hop on a bus and be used to taking a train, it's just got to suck.  So let's rally the troops and try to get some money back for you guys. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  No one's going to do it.  No.  We just take this shit day in and day out.  We eat it.  We eat that shit.  That's right.  So that's what's going on here in New York, besides the fact that we're in the middle  of fall.  Uh, what, we're getting up to 72 degrees?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  I like saying that so the people in really warm areas just openly start laughing at their  radios.  Yeah.  Why is it only going to get up to 72 degrees in late August?  I don't know.  We got some kind of a wacky weather system coming in here. 
[00:03:30]  Uh, people can't drive in.  They can't drive in it either.  What do you mean?  Driving in.  Ugh.  It's just rain.  It's just rain, exactly.  Why do you have to do 40 miles an hour?  Because it's raining.  You're not going to fly off the fucking road.  Just do at least the speed limit.  Maybe five over.  Did you hit any puddles?  No, I wasn't even hitting any of those.  That's my favorite thing when it rains really heavily.  The roads, there's always one area they just can't figure out, I guess. 
[00:04:00]  How to drain it, yeah.  So there's a pond.  Yeah, that's what's going on.  Knocking out two lanes, so now you got an hour delay because of rain because everyone  has to go into the one lane to get past the pond.  Just hit the fucking puddle.  And then you think.  It's fun.  Water flies up.  But you think, the people in charge, okay, we got a problem here.  There's a pond that forms every time there's heavy rain.  That's another thing.  Fix it!  That's another thing.  Fix something!  All the tax money and tolls and everything, and nothing gets fixed.  Nah.  You deal with cables from 1925.  Yeah.  And wait for the day for them to explode, and then they'll fix it now, I guess. 
[00:04:30]  That's one of those things we look at in 2010, and you think, God, that would have to be  fixed.  Are we still dealing with roving pothole repairs?  Oh, yeah, we are.  Are we still dealing with that?  Shouldn't there be some kind of a space-age polymer that the roads are made out of?  You would think.  But no.  You would think.  With tar being shoveled into holes by roving pothole repair. 
[00:05:00]  There's still wires on poles.  There's still fucking guardrails that are all banged up and bent up.  Where's the future?  When they show footage of 1980, a mere 30 years ago, it's the same shit out there.  Same thing.  Different model cars.  Well, even the cars sort of look similar at this point.  Sort of.  Sort of.  I mean, for the most part, it's four wheels and a body.  Well, we got GPS now.  Yeah, yeah.  A little satellite radio in the car.  We got the GPS.  Maybe a little DVD player for the kid in the back seat.  That's about it. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  It's all electronics that kind of, you know, took off.  But the car itself, look.  You know, there's the brake lights in there.  We've seen that fucking scene for our entire lives.  Diamonds and rubies, as they call it on the traffic report.  Do they?  We've got plenty of diamonds and rubies there on the garden stage.  Yeah, why don't you fuck your mother?  Stupid assholes.  Nice option.  Diamonds and what?  Diamonds and rubies.  The headlights and taillights when they're all sitting there. 
[00:06:00]  Honestly, I've never heard that one before.  Oh, yeah.  And I hope I never hear that one again.  It's pretty god-awful.  So, it's a miserable day here in New York.  Yeah.  Miserable, I say.  Miserable.  At least they got a little chuckle over Jimmy's tweet.  Which one?  Which one?  The Hitler one.  Oh, Hitler's a Jew and a...  In person.  Yeah.  I like the one that's like, the bad news or the worst news.  They're really saying Hitler's got some black and some Jew in them? 
[00:06:30]  Oh, stop it.  That's so ridiculous.  So, I've heard the Jewish thing for years.  So, he's a self-hating?  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  In person.  I think that's crazy.  That would be an uncomfortable meeting.  I hate to tell you, but you're a Jew.  At least I'm not a spook.  You didn't let me finish.  Who has decided this is true?  They said they did a DNA test.  I don't know.  What did they test DNA on?  Like, what DNA? 
[00:07:00]  I don't know.  Did they have...  His family?  Is there any offspring?  Like, family members?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Billy Hitler was obviously...  Little Billy Hitler?  It's his son, and he carries the name, but...  His son.  He actually made the stuff that made Colorform stick.  It's an odd invention.  Billy Hitler.  I heard there were some Hitlers on Long Island, right?  There are some Hitlers on Long Island.  And they had to change their names?  Yes.  So, where are these people?  Do they go to Islander games?  Oh, they... 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And what's their last name?  Have they ever been in the press?  Riffke.  Stalin.  Oh, I guess Stalin.  Stalin.  Imagine it's Riffke.  You changed it from Hitler to Stalin.  Or Hitler with a silent E at the end.  Hitler.  That's kind of weird, though.  He's got some ancestors or whatever in Long Island?  Or on Long Island?  Now, he never had children.  So, I would gather it's...  And he was an only child, wasn't he? 
[00:08:00]  So, now I'm thinking, where'd they get this DNA?  So, it's the parent's brother or sister, like his aunt or uncle, and that's where they  get it from?  I don't know.  But it seems to me, uh...  It's a big story today, though.  A little iffy bloodline there.  Yeah.  Does that bother you, Ant?  It's just the case that it's, um...  Does that confuse you?  Sensationalized, revisionist history that I don't really have much confidence in. 
[00:08:30]  But if it's true, does that confuse you?  Confuse me?  That's a good word.  Like what to do?  What to do?  What to do?  Who to rally behind?  Is that weird?  When I first read that, I wanted to give Anthony my condolences?  Sorry, buddy.  I felt like getting a Hallmark card or something.  Did they make a card for that?  I think they might at this point.  Is your dictator made up of what he hates?  Picture Hitler with a sad face.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  The guy that you idolize is a spook and a Jew. 
[00:09:00]  That's cool.  You're going to do something like, roses are big, violets are bigger.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, well, okay.  I know figure was coming in there.  Of course it was.  So we're not going to take that one seriously?  Well, I just want more research.  Jewish and African roots in the Hitler.  In the Hitler line.  In the Hitler line, right.  I don't think it's really going to make people come around to the name. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Although Michael Jordan's trying with the mustache to bring that back.  Did you see some of the newer commercials?  Yes, I have.  It's really uncomfortable.  What is he doing?  You're Jordan.  You didn't have to do that.  You can't not look at it.  It's like the only thing.  You don't look and go, oh, it's Michael Jordan.  You stare at that mustache and go, what was he thinking?  It's unbelievable.  He's been obsessed with the mustache for a while now.  And then started just taking off the sides slowly but surely. 
[00:10:00]  And now he's got this.  It's a Hitler mustache.  It's Hitler.  He's got a Hitler.  And he's Michael Jordan.  You don't have to do that.  He's bringing it back.  What the fuck?  Do you think somebody could just do that and walk around now because Michael Jordan's doing it?  Oh.  You see Hitler mustaches out there.  Do you?  Oh, yeah.  The people are usually very naive and stupid looking.  Like they don't even know.  They don't even know.  They just kind of like shaved in on the side.  And how far does it have to go before it's a Hitler? 
[00:10:30]  Does it have to just go inside the mouth line?  No.  It's like halfway.  It starts making it look creepy.  Yeah.  Like this?  Starts.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  As you put your fingers over your mustache.  Because I was thinking of it.  Don't do it.  Fucking contract negotiation times.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Just leave it alone.  Don't do it.  We can't have it.  Because I'm thinking.  Oh, it's the.  Here we go. 
[00:11:00]  The revolving monk is saying it's the ends of the nostrils down.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That's when it gets creepy.  Let me see.  No, I don't.  That's just.  No?  You don't think I should do it?  No.  Jimmy, no?  So just walk away at that point.  I don't know.  It really brings out the blue in your head.  Because you don't have it in your eyes.  Non-perfect German.  Really brings out the dark Italian in your hair.  Look at Jordan.  Jordan's sporting it.  That's a little fucking Hitler. 
[00:11:30]  That's absolutely a Hitler mustache.  Has he talked about this yet?  Why isn't anyone asking him about his mustache?  I know the bloggers out there are talking about this.  Oh, bloggers.  Has he?  That's an old joke.  And look, he can't even keep it right.  The one side is higher than the other.  Yeah, what's he doing?  He's a nut.  You think maybe he's covering up something there?  No.  A little hurt.  I don't know.  A little herpy sore.  I've heard that when porn girls have a lot of times when they let the hair come in, it 
[00:12:00]  means that they might have a little outbreak.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I know that on porn it told me that.  Oh, my God.  Hotness.  Yeah, I don't know.  But Jordan's not talking about the Hitler mustache, I guess.  Let's see.  Saliva samples taken from 39 relatives of the Nazi leader show he may have had, may have  had biological links to, quote, subhuman, unquote, races that he tried to exterminate  during the Holocaust.  A chromosome called haplogroup E1B1B1, which showed up in their samples, is rare in Western Europe and is most commonly found in the Berbers of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, as well 
[00:12:30]  as amongst Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews.  All right.  Ashkenazi.  How many?  A-S-K-H-E-N-A-Z-I.  Yeah.  It's Ashkenazi.  Almost Nazi.  Yeah.  And Sephardic Jews. 
[00:13:00]  39 relatives of the Nazi leader.  How?  Where did they get 39 relatives?  I don't know.  May have links.  A chromosome, which showed up in their samples, is rare in Western Europe, most commonly found, but not necessarily found.  Right.  It's not a, this is such a stretch.  You know, 39 relatives, we've all been at the big family gathering.  Yeah.  And you go, wow, I look like that distant uncle, or I have the same characteristics as that guy over there. 
[00:13:30]  You think there's like a young little, not even young probably at this point, right?  Some middle-aged man that's-  Looking like Hitler.  Looking and acting like Hitler in that family?  Yeah.  When they get together?  Yeah, with a sweeping hair.  Right.  And he just, he talks very passionately around the table.  Right.  Banging his hand on the table.  But he's harmless.  Yes.  Because he's just an accountant somewhere.  Yeah, he's not Hitler.  Right.  Who are these guys?  These are the Hitlers on Long Island? 
[00:14:00]  The Long Island Hitlers?  The Long Island Hitlers.  What do you know about the Long Island Hitlers?  Let's see.  Long Island landscaper peeked out of the door.  It was another visitor arriving with a notebook, a press pass, and the H-word on his lips.  The H-word.  Another journalist asking about his great uncle, Adolf.  Or Adolf.  He doesn't have to call him great.  I mean, that's just uncalled for.  No, no, they mean like great uncle, not fantastic. 
[00:14:30]  They should have just put fantastic.  Then we would know what they're talking about.  Of course.  Oh.  William.  William Patrick Hitler.  Jesus.  Son of Eloise Hitler Jr., who was Adolf Hitler's half-brother.  They shared the same father.  So he was like a half-nephew?  Yeah.  Shared the same father. 
[00:15:00]  Alois.  It's your birthday.  Look, Uncle Adolf brought you some golden teeth.  Alois called his son Willie.  The Fuhrer called Willie my loathsome nephew.  I guess Willie Hitler wasn't very popular with the Fuhrer.  He was born in 1911 in Liverpool.  Loathsome.  Early years, occasionally sought to take advantage of that last name in England, Germany, and  then America, where he moved in 39. 
[00:15:30]  Moved to America in 39.  Picked a good time to get the fuck out of Dodge.  Lived in Patchogue, Long Island.  What?  Raised his four sons.  All of the Hitlers.  Alexander, Lewis, Howard.  I'm Howard Hitler.  Robin.  Goebbels.  Howard Hitler.  Howard Hitler.  That's too easy.  I'm a Howard Hitler, Robin.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  Woo-hoo-hoo. 
[00:16:00]  Howard Hitler.  That's hysterical.  Oh, God.  Hile me, Robin.  Hile me.  It all makes sense now.  It all makes sense.  Uh, yeah, they're just, they're regular guys, Long Island guys.  Where are they now?  That's it.  Most of those guys dead.  I don't know.  That one guy was born in like 1911.  He's got to be dead, but then it's...  The father moved in 1939, right?  Yeah.  All right, so he was what, almost 30 when he moved to Long Island? 
[00:16:30]  Let me see the end of that story, Tammy.  I mean, that's what, uh, 40, 70 years ago, so his sons could still be alive.  Where's the bottom of the page that was just, uh, up there?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, back one?  Okay.  Um, it says, uh, photographs of Willy Hitler as a young man show some likeness to Adolf.  That's what I was talking about.  But most friends and neighbors in Patchogue remained unaware of his connection until Willy 
[00:17:00]  revealed it to them shortly before his death.  Aw.  Um, he said, uh, father noticed a resemblance.  One of the neighbors noticed a little resemblance.  Hey, you look like Hitler.  Anyone ever tell you you look like the Fuhrer?  Did they keep the last name or they hid the last name until the end?  I think they, uh, hid it.  Let me see a picture of him.  Hey, wait.  Is one of the kids named Ted, too?  Yes!  Was there a Ted Hitler in there, too?  Of course there was, Gregory!  Was there?  Yes, there was!  All hail my uncle! 
[00:17:30]  Even though I have a lot of Jewish friends!  It puts a strand in our relationship!  Oh, it did?  Yes!  It's a shame.  Yes, I would always go over and go, hello, how are you, blight on the planet?  Blight?  Jesus.  I'm perfect!  Oh, is that him?  Is that Willy Hitler?  Yeah.  All right, let's look at Willy Hitler.  Willy Hitler.  Oh, Danny's blowing up the picture.  Maybe you're going to come to Ted's Lampshade Emporium!  Oh, no, Ted!  All right. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, well, a little bit, but he also looks a little like Clark Gable.  Yeah, he looks like Hollywood mixed with Hitler.  And his fucking, uh...  Old Hollywood.  His awful wife looks like Jackie Gleason.  She's a fat guy.  Oh my gosh, he's horrible.  What a disaster she is!  Oh, he definitely around the eyes.  Yeah.  There's definitely a Hitler look around his eyes.  He's wearing that mustache, but he wasn't brave enough to totally commit.  No, no, he couldn't commit.  He just kept it a little tight on the side.  Pretty tight.  He really wants to move that up a bit. 
[00:18:30]  He does want to snip those edges off, doesn't he?  Oh, yes, he does.  Oh, that wife is an abomination.  Oh, God, what a pig.  As we get more info on the Hitlers on Long Island, a lot of people say that Jordan's  a big Charlie Chaplin fan.  Oh, is that it?  But he's got to know that people are not thinking Charlie Chaplin first.  You never think Charlie Chaplin first.  He's not the guy that the mustache is known for.  Oh, wow, yeah, okay.  Who's this one?  That's Willie Hitler.  Willie Hitler. 
[00:19:00]  And he definitely has a Hitler look to him around the eyes, definitely.  And why is he pointing at a map?  You never want a Hitler pointing at a map.  He looks like he's pointing at Germany.  Why would you point at a map?  Target Berlin.  I guess this is during the war, and he's an American at that point.  He came over in 1939, so he was probably against Germany and Adolf.  Little Willie Hitler.  Even though he does sport quite a resemblance there. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah, he does.  Definitely.  Little Willie.  It actually said Little Willie in that story.  But my question is, are they still alive, these guys?  No.  Willie's dead, but some of his offspring is alive.  Right.  Definitely.  Of the guy that moved here originally.  Yeah, and they're still living on Long Island.  Really?  Yeah.  The search for the Long Island Hitlers is the story.  Oh, you think they're just bothered all the time?  I don't know.  I'd give them a little knock on the door.  Hello?  Really?  Can Hitler come out and play? 
[00:20:00]  Where's Hitler?  Hitler.  That's amazing, though.  And move to see.  Long Island's a great place, isn't it?  People just love coming to Long Island.  We had Joel Rifkin.  We had Colin Ferguson.  Colin Ferguson, sure.  That lunatic.  Hitler's.  All the Hitlers settled here.  Oh, my goodness.  Wonderful.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Hitler might have been a Jew or have some Jew in him. 
[00:20:30]  I don't believe it.  And some black in him.  I don't believe it.  A little black in him.  If Hitler had a little black in him, then Sam definitely has black in him.  Oh, yeah.  Please.  Hitler didn't have any kinky hair or anything.  Can we do a DNA test on Sam?  Oh.  How would you find out?  Can we do that?  We'll take a swab from his mouth.  Can we scrape his tongue with a...  Filter out the cum.  I was going to say, scrape his tongue with a rake.  Get a good sample.  We should do a DNA test and see if it does test positive for any kind of African descendants. 
[00:21:00]  Do they have DNA kits we can purchase?  Maybe Sam's family is trying to keep that under wraps.  Whole DNA?  They have a feeling they're trying to keep that under wraps.  I don't know.  That might just be DNA for...  Does it test for paternity tests?  We could test for lupus.  The lupus gene, at least.  Lupus?  We'll test him for lupus.  I don't know.  I would love to test him, though, to see if he's got that African gene. 
[00:21:30]  You know that gene?  The moors.  The one that...  The moors.  The one that gives him that high thigh muscle.  And they did a little Willy Hitler on the History Channel.  Did they?  Well, you must have missed that one.  How did I miss that?  Ron, Oregon, what's up?  Yeah, I just saw a thing on the History Channel, and they said that Hitler was part Jew, and  that Willy, Hitler moved him over to New York and paid him off to kind of keep his mouth 
[00:22:00]  shut.  Wow, you really added a lot to the discussion.  This is amazing.  You're so enlightening.  Let me hear the click there.  Thank you.  No, he's still there.  He just bailed out.  No, he didn't.  No, I think he bailed out.  Ron.  Yeah, I heard that.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:22:30]  I'm not buying it, to tell you the truth.  Of course you're not buying it.  That would ruin everything.  Ancestry by DNA, it's $295.  Your results include an Ancestry Certificate, let's see, oh, Certification Package, Manual  to Assist You, and Interpretation of Results.  So you've got to interpret your own results?  Well, I guess you figure it out, if you look at it.  It's probably like the old EPT pregnancy test.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  You know, it wasn't easy like a yes-no thing.  You used to have to look at a circle of sediment on the bottom of the test tube.  And if it was a donut-shaped, the girl was pregnant.  And if it was just a blob of brown, it always got a little confusing.  You couldn't move them.  You had to just have them sit there and check out a flashlight in your closet.  How many near misses did you have growing up that you know that?  I used to run them for friends.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  I ran like a pregnancy test clinic in my house.  I forgot about that. 
[00:23:30]  Because these people couldn't have them in their houses.  Because, you know, their parents would get all fucked up.  So I used to buy the EPT test and just line them up in my closet and be like, all right.  Girls would just come over?  Girls and guys would be like, yeah.  Did you ever have to give the bad news?  With the girls' piss.  Nope.  Never had a positive.  No kidding?  Nope.  How many did you do?  Probably did, Jesus, between 15 and 20.  No.  Over two years of school.  Did you get money for this?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, nice.  I doubled the price of the EPT, which was like 25 bucks at the time. 
[00:24:00]  Why wouldn't they do it themselves?  They didn't.  It had to sit undisturbed for 24 hours.  Oh, and if you're a little girl, you can't have that in your room.  You can't have that in your room.  While mom's snooping around.  Yeah.  So it was the guy or girl would come in with a little thing of the girl's urine.  That's great.  And I would drink some, and then I would use the rest.  I was definitely an entrepreneur.  That's hilarious.  Running pregnancy tests in my house.  That's what?  Basically, I forgot. 
[00:24:30]  I just went through this about a year ago.  Now you piss on a stick, and it says yes or no.  It does say yes.  Right.  It says yes or no.  There's no...  It was very delicate procedure back then, because if you knocked the thing, that sediment...  Would move around too much.  ...would move around.  And then fuck you up.  And it would have to settle in the shape of a donut.  Would it give you a false positive?  It would give you a false negative.  Negative?  If you moved it.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  False negative.  Because sometimes there'd be like brown gunky stuff at the bottom, which wasn't a positive.  It would have to be a definite donut shape. 
[00:25:00]  What's the brown shit?  With a hole in the middle.  What's the brown shit?  I don't know what the brown shit was.  That's a little...  It was scary, though, because you'd see it and go like, oh, please don't donut.  Don't donut!  You just didn't want it to donut?  Don't donut!  So if it just stayed as a blob, a brown blob, you were good?  Then you were okay.  It scared you, though, the blob.  Because sometimes you wouldn't get a blob, and then you'd know.  It's like, all right, that's totally cool.  Sometimes you get a little blob, and you'd be like, oh, shit.  Is it donutting?  What is it?  Do I see a little hole in the middle?  Did you have experience to do this?  Yeah, I read the instructions.  I had experience because I had to do a couple for myself. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Not for myself, but for a lovely young lady or two.  That was so scary.  I didn't get my period.  I don't know.  I get it like clockwork every month, and I didn't get it.  I'm like, ah, EBD.  Growing up, was that the worst phone call?  You never liked that one.  Holy shit.  I don't know.  Because if you're a responsible human being, you would stress out like a motherfucker for two weeks. 
[00:26:00]  And then she'd finally get her period, and you're like, all right, let's fuck again without condoms.  Zippity-doo-dah, right?  Let's do it again now.  You would have to get noisemakers and throw a party.  The relief you felt.  Oh, it's wonderful.  All right, well, that's the Hitler story that some people are talking about today, and other people are just talking about the dumb rain, because that's what's important.  And, of course, the never-ending mosque debate, which just won't go away.  We got Pete Dominic coming in today to kind of argue the other side. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah, he's going to argue the other side.  What other side?  He's for it.  Yeah?  Yeah, a lot of people are for it.  Really?  Because Bloomberg's for it.  Bloomberg sucks.  Bloomberg had a little party up there.  Yeah, he sucks.  He bought himself $100 million he spent of his own money to get elected after he didn't want Rudy to have a third term, and he wanted one for himself.  He's a twat.  He's a twat of a mayor.  He really is.  Well, you've got to hear his statement today, because he sounded tough.  He's not tough. 
[00:27:00]  I'm joking.  This guy's never sounded tough in his life.  Please.  Like when he said that the fucking smoking SUV could have been somebody who's against health  care with slim.  Yeah.  He's an out-of-touch jerk-off.  He really is a jerk-off.  You just know when these things are radical Muslims.  Everybody knew.  Just stop already.  Everybody knew.  It's not about religious freedom.  God almighty.  No.  When every...  Even the guy who wants to do this fucking mosque is saying, American blood, Islamic... 
[00:27:30]  He's saying that we're worse than al-Qaeda.  It's fucking...  You cannot win with these fucking people.  We need to get together and learn and say, but...  There's always the, but the Americans, oh, you wacky Americans have done this and that over the years.  You can't just fucking say, you know, let's fucking, let's show that all Muslims aren't crazy.  But Muslims, if you want to know why you think Americans don't feel comfortable with you or don't like you, 
[00:28:00]  how about you for once do something that is kind of, that feels generous in a sense like that,  where, you know what, we understand why this is in poor taste.  We're going to move it.  Yeah.  Why would...  Dennis Miller had the...  I started following him on Twitter.  The best fucking...  Oh, did he?  Quote, yeah, they find it.  Yeah, what's his quote on this whole thing?  As you find that really fast, the Long Island Railroad that we started the show off,  you know, with the horrible service that's going on because of the cables from 1925, 
[00:28:30]  the Long Island Railroad has just issued an apology, Anthony, so that'll make everyone feel better.  What a doodle-y.  That'll make them feel better that they just hung around Penn Station for hours on end yesterday and today and tomorrow.  That's all you need.  No one cares about apologies.  That's all you need.  Free rides for these people would be a lot better than a dumb apology.  Apologies are great.  A dumb statement.  That takes care of you sitting on a bus.  Right.  Having to walk in the rain.  Right.  How about you hand out free coffee and donuts to the people?  You do something. 
[00:29:00]  An apology means shit.  Got a new cable.  When is an apology good?  Never.  Because it's never sincere.  First of all, apologies are never sincere.  It's never sincere.  Maybe 1% of all apologies are sincere.  Every once in a while you get a real one where you're like, holy shit, that really worked.  Yeah, you think?  1% though.  99% of the time someone was forced to make an apology.  But is it that it worked or is it that they were sincere?  If you're sincere, it helps.  But in most cases, the person isn't sincere when they're apologizing. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  They just want to move on and get business as usual flowing.  Yeah, because I think even when the apology works and people go, oh, okay, he said I'm  sorry, so that's good.  He could keep his job or keep his marriage or whatever.  I still don't think it's sincere.  No, in most cases, it's not.  Apologies are fake and phony and self-serving.  There you go.  You find the quote there, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm finding the quote.  I got his...  Maybe I should follow Dennis Miller.  He's very, very good.  Does he tweet too much?  No, not at all. 
[00:30:00]  Maybe I'll follow him then.  Is he still using big, huge fucking words to make himself seem way more intelligent than  the average man?  That's what I always hate about that fucker.  He knows everything.  He tweeted this, I guess, on the 4th.  Yeah.  That Muslims can build a mosque at the World Trade Center tells you everything about America.  That they will build it tells you everything about Islam.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  What a great quote.  And accurate.  It's like a famous quote.  That's like one of those presidential quotes that should live on in history books. 
[00:30:30]  That is a good one.  Yeah.  Now, are they sitting down at the table at least?  No.  No.  That would make me feel a little better if they at least kind of sat down, maybe at a,  I don't know, an Olive Garden or something.  Have some pasta and try to hash this shit out.  They are not sitting down with anybody.  They're just not, huh?  No.  I think that's what infuriates me more than anything.  They are building this, and that is it.  A lot of people, you know, this bothers them.  So why not sit down and maybe listen to some voices? 
[00:31:00]  They're building it.  Period.  Jesus.  All right.  And people who think that by being for this, you're for liberty, you're deluding yourselves.  Yeah.  Stop it.  No one's questioning their legal right.  No.  It's the ethical, the ethical part.  And just having some fucking feelings for the people that, uh...  They don't give a fuck.  No, they don't.  They don't give a fuck.  They're much more concerned about looking good in front of Muslims in Saudi Arabia. 
[00:31:30]  Of course.  And radical Muslims and being impressive.  Look where we got this mosque built.  Yeah, look what we did.  Right there.  Right in the shadow.  In the shadow of the World Trade Center.  Disaster.  Let's go to Marty in North Carolina.  Marty!  Good morning, boys.  This is quick.  Jimmy, you gotta smash that motherfucker Pete Dominick.  That piece of fucking ideological left-wing progressive shit spews nothing but anti-American,  pro-left-wing horse shit every fucking down the show. 
[00:32:00]  You can't argue with him because he's always right.  He's a fucking 12-year-old.  I want you to smash him, goddamn it.  He's not fucking funny.  I like, I say this, I like Pete, he's a flaming liberal, but that's, I don't mind a guy's  politics being extremely liberal.  I mean, it's a really weird thing, like you can't, Mark Maron's a very liberal guy, but  I like Mark.  I mean, you can't get mad at a guy because his politics are different.  Something like this, it's like, I hate Bloomberg, because to me, Bloomberg is an elitist. 
[00:32:30]  Bloomberg is an elitist, man.  He's a wealthy elitist who is trying to not come off like that, but that's what he is.  And he's preachy.  And it's not about American values.  Because again, nobody is saying, stop them from building it legally.  No.  Right.  Nobody is saying, fuck them, get them out.  Because I've never personally noticed a mosque going up in my life.  I've never thought about it.  As an American, I don't give a fuck where Muslims worship.  Yeah, this has never been an issue in our lives.  I've never thought about it. 
[00:33:00]  This one just hits a little too close to home, and it needs to be discussed.  And everybody knows why it's wrong.  Everybody knows why it's wrong.  It's almost like, if you're on trial for murdering somebody, and you look at the family of the  victim in the galley, and you don't say anything, but you just look at them, and there's something  in the way you look at them where they know you're gloating.  You could never prove that in court.  You could never have them penalized for that. 
[00:33:30]  But because you fucking live, and you understand human experience, you know exactly what those  motherfuckers just did.  Or what that guy just did.  Why are you on a ship's kitchen?  Because I meant to say, a galley is actually, what happens is, there was a mutiny, and there  was Somalian pirates.  Oh, okay.  And so they were trying them.  Right.  On the ship.  In the galley, I think, is appropriate for a court.  All right.  I was just wondering.  Yes.  This is funny, anyway.  It's picky, Anthony.  Well, Pete Dominic will be in.  It'll be, I think it'll be interesting to see his take on this whole thing. 
[00:34:00]  I know what it's going to be.  It's what all liberals are saying.  It's, what can you say?  Hey, it's America.  It's religious freedom.  It's, I'm sick of hearing about tolerance when I have not felt one ounce of it back from  Muslims.  In the sense of, in the world, I have not felt or sensed one fucking ounce of it.  But, yeah, there's nothing coming from their side without a but and a, well, if, stop. 
[00:34:30]  I don't feel this way about any other religious group.  None.  Nope.  No.  All you want from that is, why aren't we looked at as common America?  I don't know, because you're fucking, the Trade Center was attacked in the name of Islam,  even though it wasn't you guys or your mentality.  You know that, and you're building a mosque there and saying, fuck you to everybody who  objects.  Stop it.  It's their responsibility to not build it there.  You know what you're doing. 
[00:35:00]  It's not ours to say, don't build it there.  Bloomberg said something very different than what you just said, and I wish, I wish I had  it in front of me.  Do we have it in front of, oh, they're getting it?  Okay, I'm sorry.  We'll have it in a minute or two.  I just cannot stomach Bloomberg.  Yeah, I don't like him.  He doesn't seem likeable.  He's a hateable fucking guy.  Yeah, I don't really like the guy at all, man.  Couldn't just do two terms like he was supposed to?  Why couldn't Rudy do?  I think the city was in a lot better shape when Rudy was here.  Oh, he got up there.  Remember Bloomberg saying, oh, no, it's time for us to move on and elect a new mayor. 
[00:35:30]  And then he pulls shenanigans and gets a third term.  Rich pussy.  He is.  And they're off.  The phones are lit again.  We'll do this whole thing when Pete Dominick comes in at 730.  Oh, you're at 730.  All right, cool.  Yeah, so, I mean, it's right around the corner, so we could do some other things.  And then we move into some Mosca talk.  And the fact that Pete is gay is not important.  I don't care about his sexuality.  Oh, what?  The guy likes cocks.  Oh, what?  He's a good guy.  The cock. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, we got food in front of us.  Why don't we go for an early break today so we can eat?  Speaking of talk.  Hey, Ving Rhames was in very recently.  He certainly was.  Is that movie out?  That Piranha movie?  Oh, yes.  Very scary.  Are people enjoying it?  Oh, they're loving it.  Is it campy?  Oh, no, they love it.  They're loving Piranha?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  All I know is the Matt Hooper character has been perversely fucking twisted.  Oh, no shit.  It's 81% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Positive reviews?  81%.  Maybe it's a great 3D movie. 
[00:36:30]  Maybe it's a 3D movie.  What are they saying about Piranha?  I thought this was just a dumb, goofy movie.  It's got some good bite to it.  Packed with enough nudity to make Russ Meyers proud.  Oh, Russ Meyers.  Nice.  Would have named it Piranha 3DD.  Really?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We know what they're going for.  They're bringing back the titties into movies.  Yeah.  It's about time.  Yep.  We had about a 10-year dry spell.  An absence of titties. 
[00:37:00]  Absolutely, man.  They took the titty right out of the movie.  Every movie had a titty shot, right?  Yeah.  Not even back in the day.  And about maybe the last 10 years.  Yeah.  They stopped with the tits.  For the most part.  You know.  By the last thing, you guys want to hear a great text I got?  Yeah.  Because there happened to be a little article mentioning my name and, you know.  Vanity Fair.  You know, whatever.  Vanity Fair.  You know how it is on Vanity Fair.  So I wanted to link it.  So I wrote to Danny Ross.  Hey, Danny, is it possible to name a link to an article?  Rename it so I can tweet it. 
[00:37:30]  And then hours later, still not Danny.  Sorry.  So I need your phone number.  Oh, shit.  Thank God it wasn't a cockpit.  Oh, shit.  People have comments about the mosque.  Save it for 730.  Yes, save it.  Ving Rhames was in and a lot of people picked up on the fact that he said, quote, unquote.  So with that in mind, we play this.  And now here's 32 seconds, quote, unquote, with Ving Rhames, quote, unquote, talking about the hood, quote, unquote. 
[00:38:00]  I grew up, quote, unquote, under hood rules.  I grew up on 126th Street in Harlem.  You feel me?  There's a hood rule that you don't, quote, unquote, snitch on me.  That's a hood rule.  You see what I'm saying?  Now, that's different than, quote, unquote, mainstream America rules.  You see what I'm saying?  But in mainstream, that's hood rules, you see?  And so, one, people don't understand, quote, unquote, street codes and hood rules.  You see what I'm saying?  Oh, I'll put it this way. 
[00:38:30]  Only the hood, quote, unquote, can police the hood, period, quote, unquote, period.  You see?  Where's Egypt?  Egypt is in Africa.  That was 32 seconds of, quote, unquote, Ving Rhames talking about the hood, quote, unquote, the end, quote, unquote.  And I'll leave it at that, quote, unquote.  Open entry.  I say, don't you know?  You say, you don't know.  I say, take me out.  I say, you don't show. 
[00:39:00]  Don't move, time's low.  I say, take me out.  Checking out Opie and Anthony.  Can we eat eggs?  Are the eggs all right?  Recalled like a half a billion of them, I think.  A half a billion eggs?  How do you recall an egg?  It's retarded.  Wow.  What are they going to do with all those eggs?  Throw them away.  Save them for Halloween. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  There's a little problem they had with them.  Is it salmonella?  Salmonella.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  Some kind of fucking organism growing while we sleep.  Growing in your aggie wags.  Yeah.  So now everyone's running for the organic eggs because I guess those are all right.  Are they?  So is that some kind of scam going on?  I don't know.  It must have been a problem.  Most of those places that they get eggs from are really filthy and chicken shit is not 
[00:40:00]  good.  Yeah, but we never have a problem like this.  Yeah, occasionally.  So who fucked up?  Occasionally.  Think somebody just decided to take a dump on the eggs or something?  Yeah, someone shit on the eggs.  Said, fuck this.  If my boss isn't going to pay me, I'm going to take a dump on the eggs.  I'm having explosive diarrhea on the eggs.  Every time there's a recall, you know it's just a disgruntled employee saying, oh really?  You're not going to give me that 50 cents an hour raise?  Well, watch what I do for you.  Yeah.  I'm going to spread my feces. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  They just smear them.  My feces.  Smear them on the toys, the eggs, the asparagus, whatever the fuck they're recalling.  The spinach.  Hey, there was something else.  Oh, breaking news.  Lindsay Lohan is free to go.  Thank goodness.  Free to do her drugs.  I guess she's okay.  Yeah, she's fine.  I guess everything's fine.  She paid her debt to society, and she's out of rehab because, of course, forced rehab 
[00:41:00]  that is cut short by months always works.  And the jail sentence cut short by months.  She really learned her lesson, Anthony, I'm telling you.  Yeah, she'll be fine.  She now gets to make about a million dollars to tell her story.  Because it's a tough story.  Yeah.  You know, all those years in the joint.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Maybe 10 days.  I gather she's also moving to New York.  That's what I hear today.  Really?  Moving to New York, leaving that L.A.  Oh, because New York's not a party scene.  No, no. 
[00:41:30]  The bars are open until four in the morning here.  Right.  As opposed to two.  Right.  In L.A., so.  Yeah, we don't see drunks just wandering around the streets as we're coming into work.  Never.  This is a very safe place for.  Good for her.  For a fucking addict.  Can't wait to see her.  It's called wherever I went, there I was.  She's trying to geographically call it.  Oh, really?  Sure.  Let me get out of L.A.  L.A.'s the problem.  Yeah.  Not the fact that I'm a cunt.  It's L.A.  All right.  Oh, is that what they do?  Interesting.  So she'll just bring her problems with her, you thinking, Jimmy? 
[00:42:00]  Like fucking luggage that's stapled to her cliff.  Pack up your troubles in your old brown bag and smile, smile, smile.  Is that a song?  Boo!  Boo that you know that.  I don't know.  Rocketing Yoo-Hoo on the eggs.  J.D. in New York City.  Rocket Yoo-Hoo onto the eggs.  And J.D.'s claiming that.  That's his, so don't rip him off.  Rocketing Yoo-Hoo on the eggs.  Rocketing Yoo-Hoo on the eggs. 
[00:42:30]  Stupid Lindsay Lohan.  Oh, there she is.  Free at last.  What?  Lilo, they call her.  I need free at last.  They call her Lilo.  What the?  Or Lilo.  What is she talking about?  Free at last.  Free at last.  Oh, thank God these assholes are laughing at her.  Ugh.  All right.  Oh, they're laughing at Patterson, actually, saying cock.  Did we hear that?  I didn't hear it.  You want to hear that?  Patterson's gaff.  Yeah, I guess he said gack.  Race to the what now?  Ugh.  What did he do?  He was talking into a giant man's cock.  So we thank President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arnie Duncan for coming up with 
[00:43:00]  the race to the cock top concept, for standing by it even when it was criticized all over.  Usually you know what word he was supposed to say.  The race to the cock.  I'm entered.  What was on his mind?  I hold the pole position.  Yes, but everybody's running backwards.  You don't run forwards.  You might trip and hit your knee on the cock.  A race to the cock.  Obama and Secretary of Education Arnie Duncan for coming up with the race to the cock top concept, 
[00:43:30]  for standing by it even when it was criticized all over.  And then he almost said the fucking, you know, the C word.  But why wouldn't you just, like, pause for a second and address that you just said race  to the cock as the governor?  And then just go, did I just say cock?  Yeah.  Not everyone could laugh and laugh and laugh.  Or just go, that's not what I meant.  You know, make a moment out of it.  And God, you didn't get to see the people's faces.  Exactly.  Oh, it's a panty shot.  Who is that? 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  Let's see.  Heidi Montag.  Yeah, she's got a little whoopsie there.  Blue panties.  Yeah.  Blue panties.  Blue panties.  She's the one with the G's, right?  She went and got G's.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She's the one with the plastic surgeon that she couldn't, the plastic surgeon, I guess,  couldn't take it anymore, so he just, he just fucking drove his car off a cliff.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Why are we laughing?  It is fucked up, though.  Because I know what happened.  This stupid broad keeps calling him for more plastic surgery, and he finally had it. 
[00:44:30]  He took his own life.  He couldn't take it.  So he didn't have to work on Frankenstein anymore.  Oh, and fucking drove his car off a cliff?  Oh, whose ass is that?  Funny, I was talking to Jonathan, I made fun of him, and Jonathan's like, yeah, I knew  that guy.  It's like, of course he knows everybody.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Of course he did.  Yeah, wow.  Is that a pussy, Naomi Campbell?  It's Naomi Campbell, but you can't see it.  It's too dark to see.  Too dark to see.  Like, that should be a snatch shot, but you can't see it.  Really?  That would be a nice snatch shot?  I think it's...  You can't tell. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah, you can.  You can't really tell, is it?  Yeah, there's some hooli hooli right there.  Is she wearing a thong, or is that a slit?  No, I think that's some action.  That's some action right there.  You've got to turn the contrast way up.  That's where you put your penis.  You put your wee-wee in that hole.  Right there.  And go back and forth until it comes east.  I hope you don't have to go into Anthony's closet to take a pregnancy test.  No.  Fucking weirdo.  That's how it's done, though. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, is Danny actually turning the contrast?  Are you?  He's going to try to...  Where is this picture for the other people?  That's a negative.  All right.  It might work, though.  I said negative.  What would Tyler Durden do?  Right on.  WTB.  Oh, I don't go for those type of photos.  We're trying to figure out if it's...  Yeah, I don't have any, like, real editing software, so I just have this open in paint that  I'm trying to fuck around.  Yeah, right.  Try to see if that's her pussy.  You can't tell if it's Naomi Campbell's pussy because...  I have some shit in the other room, but not in here. 
[00:46:00]  She's too dark.  It's too dark under there.  I'll get E-Rock on the case.  Yeah.  JJ, New Hampshire.  What's up, buddy?  Hello.  Good talking to you.  Thanks.  I'm not spending any fucking time with fucking idiots today.  With morons.  So there you go.  Lindsay Lohan's the big news story today.  Yeah, I can't wait to see her walking around New York City.  Yeah.  She was quite the cunt when she came in that day.  She was just a fucking, an average-looking, nice-titted, freckled idiot. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  The freckles take away from it.  I'd lick them, though.  I'd lick her freckled tits.  Would you?  Yeah.  And I'd call them freckled tits a lot.  I love those words.  Is there anything more bothersome than freckled tits?  I don't mind freckled tits.  Not a light one here and there.  I'm talking where the skin is completely covered.  Where it's completely covered?  Yes.  You don't see that very often.  Yeah.  Here comes Sam.  He's got a little something for us.  Oh, does he? 
[00:47:00]  He's got a tidbit in his hand.  I see he's carrying a tidbit.  A tidbit.  I hope you mean shotgun with a toe attack.  Sam.  Yeah?  I had to go to bed way too early last night.  Prince Poppycock, did he perform last night?  Oh, he killed it last night.  Did he?  It was all Prince Poppycock last night.  Yeah.  Then he changed the name of the show.  It was all about Prince Poppycock.  Yeah.  There was no reason for anybody else to perform.  I was bored to death the first hour of America's Got Talent.  Everyone was a bust.  How long is it?  A couple hours. 
[00:47:30]  Two hours.  Two hours.  It's called America's Got Nothing to Do.  Yeah, this is a...  How do you spend two fucking hours watching that drivel?  In anticipation of Prince Poppycock.  Oh.  He killed it, though.  Oh, he destroyed it.  When is Jimmy dressing up as Prince Poppycock?  When you guys bring me the outfit.  I mean, who...  You know, please.  Well, Janine showed what she could do with the makeup, and you still...  I who looked?  I didn't look.  Why would I...  Why would I...  Why would you look?  I don't know, because there's bloodshows.com, and there's fucking tranny videos I would  rather watch.  But she probably spent ten hours on the makeup just to impress you. 
[00:48:00]  I love Janine, but please.  But please.  Send me a picture of big clits and nice heinies, and don't try to trick me by sending that and  saying that that's what they are, because I have someone look at them first.  Walk us through the Prince Poppycock.  What did he do on America's Got Talent last night?  Sucked a cock and sang.  End of discussion.  Homol.  But we're confused.  We don't know if this guy's gay, man, because when...  He's out of makeup talking.  We don't?  Oh, now we know?  He's gay for sure.  Please.  What was the tell?  Well, they did a video of him, like, transforming... 
[00:48:30]  I mean, he's gay.  He's for sure gay.  Prince Poppycock.  Yeah, he's gay.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's got long hair, which is not big in the gay community right now.  That might be the only thing that throws somebody off.  Yes, they're very into short hair.  Right.  They're very much into the short hair thing.  Masculine.  But yeah, he's definitely, for sure, gay, I think.  Do we have that video online yet, or is it too early?  I want to see him transforming into Prince Poppycock from a machinist, Dan.  He's like, he works on fucking metal shit. 
[00:49:00]  Does he?  Yes.  Is that what he does?  He's got a very manly job, and then at night he becomes Prince Poppycock.  Poppycock.  Ah, second.  Poppycock.  Stop it.  Well, you're not a fan of the Prince?  No.  You're not?  Dressing up like that for gimmick.  Exactly.  A gimmicky ass.  Fucking dopey marionette doll.  Just fucking rub a dick on your face and make the yummy noise.  I'm tiring of this fucking show, though, man.  I wouldn't fucking...  America's got talent.  I love Sharon.  This is going on and on and on.  And I like Howie Mandel, and I think some talented people do the show, but it's like, 
[00:49:30]  I just don't care.  Yeah.  I could care less.  Prince Poppycock's a good singer.  Good for him.  Put out a record.  It's great.  I just want to see him transform.  Here we go, guys.  Here's the Prince Poppycock for you.  I like how you become this crazy character.  You're becoming my guilty pleasure.  America has voted.  Prince Poppycock.  I was so thrilled when they called my name. 
[00:50:00]  I couldn't believe it.  All that hard work, waiting up to that moment, paid off, and I was proud.  It looks like Weird Al Suckatick.  Weird Al Yankikov.  America, accept me and take me to the semifinals.  That means America's creating a place for me to belong.  I'm pleased to be a true artist.  He has an unbelievable voice. 
[00:50:30]  These characters that he creates are a never-ending,  and I just can't wait to see where he's going to take us next.  This is really, his name should be Prince Shit Dick.  Picking out fabrics, designing costumes.  Picking out fabrics.  He's designing costumes.  I was trying to pick out fabrics.  He's doing his own makeup.  But if I were in Vegas, I would see Prince Poppycock.  Crazy Joe DiVolo.  That's who he is.  From Los Angeles, California, please welcome Prince Poppycock. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  How many people does she have with her?  Oh, boy, nobody loves me.  It's a set.  It's a theatrical.  Easy come, easy go.  Will you let me go?  Let me go.  Let me go.  Let me go.  Let me go.  Let me go. 
[00:51:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let me go as a devil for the side.  Freddie Mercury is spinning on his pop.  So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye.  Got firework.  He's smashing all his glass plates.  Oh, baby.  Get to this, Joe.  Besides that champagne bottle.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  He shoves it up his ass.  It's a finale.  The sound quality is very good.  He's mic'd very well.  Oh, he plays the piano, too.  Yeah.  He's going to take the organ.  That old dad.  Nothing really matters.  Anyone can see.  Nothing really matters.  Except big fat cock.  Nothing really matters.  HIV. 
[00:52:30]  Take that.  Blows.  The confetti.  And he missed it.  That is theatrical.  Instead of saying nothing really matters to me, he said nothing really matters but me.  Oh.  But.  I missed that.  No humility.  I like it.  Wow.  And how did they react to how they love those poppy cows?  You can tell they love him. 
[00:53:00]  America loves him.  Is that true?  This fucking guy is going to be a huge star.  Sharon Osbourne is giving him a standing ovation.  I think he said it best when he said nothing really matters but you.  Cheers.  This is your night.  This is all about poppy cock.  Thank you.  I think all the other contestants do that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Cheers.  Prince swappy cock.  So covered in shit.  Got lima bean skins on it.  You look like any crackers, aren't you, poppy cock? 
[00:53:30]  I mean, you are crackers.  Listen to yourself.  Poppy cock, you're crackers.  You're not making any sense, man.  You're making perfect sense.  Oh, the good-natured ribbing.  Oh, yes.  There's blue lips.  I tell you what.  You are the male Lady Gaga.  You.  No, she is.  You're a superstar.  I'm a superstar, and I bow down to you.  Lady Gaga.  Mr. Goo Goo.  No, my empress.  My hat is off to you.  If it wasn't pinned on so tightly. 
[00:54:00]  There you go.  Prince poppy cock.  Wow.  Sweeping the nation.  He is.  He's going to be a big star.  That fucking guy.  The fucking hundred-headed broom.  That fucking guy is going to be huge.  Is he?  Yes, it's obvious.  On Broadway.  Not for our audience, for the most part, but that's all it takes to be fucking huge.  Our audience would throw fucking balloons filled with gas at them.  Our audience hates Prince poppy cock.  And road flares.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:54:30]  They would yell, faggot, and drive away quickly in a pickup truck.  Our audience.  That's what I'm saying.  This show's audience, there's three of them that would go see Prince poppy cock.  One of them's in this room, and one's our producer.  Actually, two are our producer.  Yes!  Have you seen Prince poppy cock on Broadway?  It was fabulous.  Those are the names of three of my friends.  Prince poppy and cock.  It's a legal firm I go to for all my legal work. 
[00:55:00]  He's the gayest.  Freddie Mercury's version wasn't much more manly than Prince poppy cock's.  We all knew what fucking Freddie Mercury was like.  I didn't fucking know growing up.  I just liked the music.  I had no idea.  Sarah from Buffalo says it all.  Nothing says I'm gay like dressing up like a fool and singing Bohemian Rhapsody.  Oh, he's so gay.  We might need that.  Whatever.  Reverend Al is talking about it because it might be mosque stuff.  Reverend Al getting involved?  Or maybe he's talking about Black Hitler today. 
[00:55:30]  Black Hitler.  Maybe he's talking about Prince poppy cock.  Yeah.  Never know.  Prince poppy cock.  Yeah.  The prince.  So he's going to win it all?  Of course he is.  What about that kid?  The little girl singing opera.  No.  Prince poppy cock will win because Prince poppy cock...  No, the little girl singing opera is much better.  Much better than Prince poppy cock.  No, Prince poppy cock can handle a Vegas show.  He's got staying power.  Staying power.  This kid's going to grow up and then nobody's going to see her.  It's just going to be some shit singing.  You know what?  If you think Vegas, you think Prince poppy cock. 
[00:56:00]  Thank you very much.  No, no.  I think fucking...  I think gambling and female prostitutes.  Not giant chess pieces.  Fucking gaping anuses.  You wouldn't see a Prince poppy cock show before you did all that other stuff?  Not if he was fucking performing it on my pillow in my room.  Gaping anuses.  Yes.  Does he scare you?  No.  Does the Prince poppy cock scare you?  No.  Not at all.  It doesn't bother me that he's a fucking...  I just have no desire to see him.  Even though he's talented, but fuck him, so what?  I'll check it out.  Who else was good last night that I missed? 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  I was just...  I was in Prince poppy cock mode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not interested in any other contestant.  I hope they all lose.  Yeah.  Good for you.  He looks like Francois-Pierre Delibrioski.  I'm out on that one.  When Norton dressed up as the French guy that he thought built the sewers of France.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's what he looks like.  I'm way behind on my honeymooners.  He condemned them. 
[00:57:00]  That's what he looks like.  All right.  It was the Man from Space episode.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James.  He's back.  What happened to your phone, JJ?  I live up in the mountains, and we tend to lose signal as well as society.  Society.  Ah.  Hey, I just wanted to see if the internet god that is Danny Ross has yet discovered.  There's a new video out.  I discovered it on FridayFile.com. 
[00:57:30]  It's just labeled Red Toyota Truck Crashes.  It's a truck full of immigrants coming down the highway.  Yeah.  And the bed is loaded, and the thing just rolls, and they come out like confetti.  I've been tweeting that video, and I didn't retweet it because I'm not really sure.  I'm trying to figure out if it's real or not.  Uh-oh.  Might not be real.  Yeah, because why does the guy all of a sudden have his camera set up outside his house as this truck is coming down this hill?  It's real.  I don't get it.  Is that with the family in it? 
[00:58:00]  And they all go flying all over the road?  I haven't seen that.  Oh, well, maybe.  He's angry.  But even if it is real, to me, I had the same question.  Oh, did it.  Why is there a camera set up there?  It's weird.  All of a sudden, the camera just kind of like does a pan, and all of a sudden, oh, truck coming.  Might as well keep the camera rolling.  Wow.  But I'm not smart enough at this shit to see where it's fake.  See if it's fake.  I just assumed it was some jackass being nosy and filming the guys doing the yard work next to him, it kind of looks like. 
[00:58:30]  You know what I mean?  Right.  A bunch of Mexicans too close to his house, so he set up a video camera.  Anthony.  What's that?  I saw it on...  No way, Jimmy.  Danny, I think it was on LiveLeak.  Was it on LiveLeak?  It used to be Ogrish.  Really?  LiveLeak used to be Ogrish?  It did, yeah.  I didn't know that.  This goes back a couple weeks, if that helps you out. 
[00:59:00]  On the Friday file, I believe it was probably...  The what?  No.  Friday file.  Oh.  It's different.  I'm in trouble.  I yelled at.  Four of them.  I'm talking about you, Uncle Paul.  We're all giggling at the same time.  God, that was hot.  No.  We can't find it, huh?  Laughing children.  What the fuck did I see it?  I thought it was LiveLeak.  Frozen.  Hang on.  Oh, the computer's frozen.  All right.  You want to watch a person burn alive? 
[00:59:30]  No.  Oh, that's terrible.  All right.  So you might want to see some good Venezuelan mob justice.  That's all.  No, it's very disturbing.  Well, JJ, our internet sucks.  Why does our internet suck?  It's a combination of a whole bunch of things.  Shitty computers, internet explorers.  Why can't they upgrade all this shit?  I see videos all day long.  And a lot of times it's a website, too.  A lot of times websites will get hung up on loading one ad or some shit, and it just  locks everything down until it's done. 
[01:00:00]  Unbelievable.  Hey, by the way, I got a letter in the mail yesterday, and Time Warner Cable is begging  for me to keep my service.  Did you get the letter yet, Jimmy?  Now they want to play and do the right thing by the customer.  No, I don't know if it's in my building yet, but I know that I got a letter from them  saying that the discount that had been offered in my building is no longer being offered.  That's the letter I got.  That means it's going to cost me more.  Right.  They're going to raise your rates.  They're going to raise...  Listen to what these assholes are doing.  Our building is now wired for Fios. 
[01:00:30]  Anthony loves the Fios, right?  Love it.  Love it.  I want to try anything else but Time Warner Cable.  Every time I've had a problem, it just sucks getting people on the phone, getting people  out to your apartment.  It's just a nightmare, okay?  So I'm ready to try anything.  And I guess they offer the building like a discount rate.  So because they're rewiring the building for Fios, the building has rejected their latest  contract.  So now Time Warner sent out all these letters saying, look, it's going to cost more to have 
[01:01:00]  Time Warner Cable in your apartment.  Don't blame us.  Blame the building.  That's what the letter is basically saying.  Oh, great.  With the PS saying, look, and if they go with another service, they could be doing damage  to your apartment to get all the equipment in and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, Christ.  That was the PS.  They're trying.  A letter of desperation.  Yep.  That's what it is.  They saw what happened with Cablevision.  Right.  But instead of coming to us and going, look, I know you're going to have another choice  in your building, so we're going to lower your rates, hopefully, to keep you as a customer. 
[01:01:30]  No, they're raising the rates and blaming the building.  On the building.  Dude, if we have Fios in our building, I'm hoping that...  I get the same letter you did, so I'm hoping that means I would fucking go to Fios in a  second.  Oh, yeah.  Just to try something.  You love it, right, Ant?  I love it.  You don't have that...  None of that crap.  You're trying to watch a fucking movie.  It's skipping.  You're trying to watch a movie and you're having a hearing test. 
[01:02:00]  It's terrible.  I know.  It's horrible.  God.  It really is the most annoying fucking thing, sitting there watching your movie pixelate.  Terrible.  But...  Well, I think we go out to the...  What's going on?  Uh, Ocho Cinco.  Say hello to my little friend.  What?  What's he saying? 
[01:02:30]  Ocho Cinco was fined $25,000 for tweeting during a preseason game.  What?  This guy needs attention.  Ocho Cinco.  He needs a lot of attention.  He figured he could do it during a preseason game.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, during a regular game...  You're not allowed to tweet during the games?  I think during a regular game, they would fine him big time and really make an example.  But because it was a preseason game, he knew he could get away with it and he would  more than willing to pay the fine to get his name all over the place again.  The guy knows how to get his name in the press, that's for sure. 
[01:03:00]  Got that going on.  How much did it cost him?  25 G's.  That's a lot of cake.  Not for him.  No, not for him.  Not for him.  That's easy.  That's an expensive tweet.  Johnny Damon rejects the Red Sox waiver claims.  Whoa.  Decides to stay in Detroit.  Really?  Must like the D.  Wow.  And Chicago Cubs create a peanut-free zone for fans with peanut allergies.  Peanut?  Did I say peanut?  Peanut.  Peanut.  Peanut-free zone for fans with peanut allergies. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, is that...  Yeah.  Why is that such a big thing now?  The peanut?  Oh, you found it?  Peanut.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, come on.  Can you start it over?  They're mannequins.  Huh?  They look like mannequins.  They're mannequins.  But one guy gets up, so is that...  Oh, I don't know.  Epic crash.  Let's do it up.  See, this guy just happens to be filming this pickup truck flying down the hill.  It looks like they lost their brakes.  They're starting to square from side to side. 
[01:04:00]  And they all go flying.  They look dead.  Which guy gets up?  Oh, wait a minute.  So it's mannequins?  It looked like mannequins.  Those people could have been behind the...  Behind the camera angle?  I don't know.  And then they just walk onto the...  Ow.  The scene?  Why couldn't it be real?  Yeah, I don't know what to think of this one. 
[01:04:30]  Because that guy's...  These two are just getting up like it was nothing and dusting themselves off.  Who would survive that?  By the way, who was just filming it and then turning the camera to...  That camera pans at the end.  Right.  So someone's holding that, filming the street.  For what?  Yeah, why would you all of a sudden have a camera?  No one gets that lucky when they're filming.  And they go off camera.  I should say no one, but...  Yeah, then the people that fell out of the truck are off camera. 
[01:05:00]  And then he pans over and all of a sudden you see people on the street  kind of getting up and walking away from the accident  with most of the people still on the ground.  Slow motion action.  I don't know.  I'm thinking it's real.  You're thinking it's real, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm thinking it's real.  Oh, it's fake.  What's up?  It's obviously daytime and the time stamp says 10, 10 p.m. 
[01:05:30]  All right, Danny Royce!  Fake!  Fake!  Fake!  So fake!  The old time stamp.  Where did you finally find it, Danny, for the people out there?  What's that, sir?  Well, just send it to me.  It's, uh...  Okay.  And then I'll fucking just tweet it.  You guys decide if it's fake or not.  For me, tiny URL is more fun.  Tiny URL?  That shit!  You gotta love the tiny URL, right?  Hell yeah.  Especially when Twitter only gives you 140 characters.  Of course you gotta love the tiny URL.  I like that they only give you that much. 
[01:06:00]  You gotta be creative.  Yeah.  And you can't babble on.  I'm thinking 150.  It would be perfect.  Give me 10 more characters.  You'd still be backing off and fucking taking spaces out in punctuations.  True.  True.  I love how you gotta look at it and go, all right.  Punctuation means nothing on Twitter.  I'm 8 over.  Right.  I'm 8 characters over.  It's like a game.  Let me get rid of this period.  Right.  I'm gonna just...  I don't need a space between that.  Yeah.  I'm gonna get rid of that word.  I can make it a shorter word.  I could just have the number 2 instead of spelling it out. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  That'll save me a couple of letters.  I got that.  It's very important.  Just save two more right there.  Because I'm going T-O-O.  Here's the Bloomberg shit.  Bye.  And this leads into Pete Dominick coming in to say hi and argue the other side.  Pete is a bum.  All righty.  I'm not getting an iPhone.  What?  They had a torch commercial on TV, so everything's good with the torch. 
[01:07:00]  I'm ready to go.  They even said, for work and play.  Oh, really?  We're seeing either.  You got the buttons for work and then you freaking do the touch screen for play.  No.  Gonna be rocking the torch.  Just get an iPhone.  Here's Bloomberg.  Before some 95 Muslim leaders from New York City, Mayor Bloomberg held a Ramadan iftar at  Gracie Mansion, a dinner honoring the end of Ramadan fasting, the holy month of Muslims,  the month when the Quran was written.  Why is he doing this? 
[01:07:30]  Because he's a fucking cock.  That's why.  He's a cock.  For the people that don't know, he doesn't live in Gracie Mansion like the rest of the  mayors of New York City because his place is way fucking better on the Upper East Side.  So why is he throwing this little shindig?  At his fake house.  At his fake house.  Hey, you like hanging out with all these people?  Have them in your real home.  Oh, he doesn't want that.  They probably had to fucking get a cleaning crew in Gracie Mansion to get it set for a  party.  That guy hasn't been in that mansion in months. 
[01:08:00]  Why clean for those people?  Please.  The holy month of Muslims, the month when the Quran was revealed.  Before the developer and wife of the imam of a mosque planned two blocks from ground zero  to merely iterate his defense of it.  By acknowledging the pain of the 9-11 families, he emphasized freedom of religion is an American  basic right.  Islam did not attack the World Trade Center.  Al-Qaeda did.  To implicate all of Islam for the actions of a few who twisted a great religion is unfair 
[01:08:30]  and an American.  There you go.  I don't even fault his logic there.  I mean, technically that's correct.  However, they did it in the name of Islam and every terrorist act is committed in the  name of Islam.  That's why the fucking mosque builders should be sensitive to that.  It's more than just a couple.  Reverend Al was talking about the mosque and we got the audio.  I guarantee he was for it. 
[01:09:00]  He was saying in America we have freedoms.  And there's been racism in this country and degradation of different people of color  and degradation of different people who are not white Anglo-Saxon.  We all know.  Well, let's get the second Bloomberg clip on first.  The developer putting up the mosque who aided the FBI after 9-11 said the mayor's support  of it helps defeat terrorism 100%.  He touches my heart every time that I get to hear his issues on our rights as Americans. 
[01:09:30]  Would you be willing to do with 9-11 families, sir, about this issue?  That's it.  Thank you.  Ah, yeah, of course.  Run away.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just answer that and say, no, I haven't talked to them?  Answer the fucking question.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  I got to get out of here.  Run.  Let me run.  But I'll say this.  As much as this mosque is annoying, we should take our bases out of fucking certain places  where they don't want our bases either.  We should not have our military in places like Saudi Arabia. 
[01:10:00]  For what?  Why do we have any Americans over there?  It's for a quick response, just in case any shenanigans happen.  Keep a ship out there with fucking, just with big bombs on it and stop worrying about  the shitty civilian population.  God, are we a dumb country.  Goody two-shoes.  Meddlers.  We're a country of meddlers.  Meddlers.  Nosy Nancys.  And it is very, you know, the oil does have to flow for us.  So we got to make sure, you know, shipping stays open and some of these countries don't 
[01:10:30]  fall into the hands of a shenanigans.  Then why don't we just fucking start really working towards alternative energy choices  and stop relying on these fucking scumbags.  I know.  We're trying.  We're bound to them.  Windmills.  It's hard to get a windmill on top of your car.  Windmills.  A giant windmill on your car.  Big back up at the tunnel because everyone has their windmills. 
[01:11:00]  Their windmills are running.  Keep hitting the inside of the tunnel.  No one was smart enough to figure it out ahead of time.  Silly with that thing.  You're all excited about your windmill as you drive into the city.  Ah, the windmill.  Blowing pedestrians all over the fucking sidewalks.  Here's what Reverend Al had to say.  Reverend Sharpton, I just want to ask you how you kind of grappled with this issue over  the last couple weeks.  You're a New Yorker through and through.  You're sensitive to the pain of the victims and of the first responders.  At the same time, you're a man of faith as well who has reached out to other faiths. 
[01:11:30]  How have you...  Hold on.  Can you pause that for one second?  How long of a biography on Sharpton's emotions, you cunt?  Hey, Al, how do you feel about the mosque?  Go.  I think most people know what Reverend Al is all about.  Yes.  Doesn't mean a big introduction.  A man of color who enjoys eating gyros and falafel and other fattening things and your  hair like Fred Flintstone and you once yelled Greek homos and you've been a racist and  Alton Modocs.  Robert, shut up.  We know.  Do-do on the chest and signed it and fucking Pagonis in a lawsuit. 
[01:12:00]  You just throw Popeye's chicken in there somewhere today.  Yeah.  Popeye's chicken.  A boneless bucket.  You get your bucket in.  Yeah.  Licking your fingers and Roy Ennis pushing.  Arpton, Reverend Man of God, Big Medallion, Brooklyn Fire Stabbed by fucking, you know...  One of Jim Norton's fans.  Yeah.  A big fan of Jim Norton.  Can I talk now?  I'm allegedly on video, cocaine by Big Mustache, HBO, many years ago.  Ward Downey Jr. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Reverend Al, one fat skinny Newsweek cover.  We got it.  You love Al.  You got it.  You have to...  Now I got to hear the fucking show again.  It's a fucking cunt reporter.  It's the newest intro.  How many things are you going to say about him?  You're black.  You're five foot eight.  You enjoy eating collard greens.  You clip your toenails.  You sort of march.  Yeah, you like to march.  I don't think he likes to march.  I think he marches a block with the cameras and then he bails because why would you be so 
[01:13:00]  fat if you're fucking marching all the time?  But he has lost weight since he stopped marching.  I don't know what happened.  He's probably just eating too much at the end of the marches.  Like, daughter in trouble.  Nappy-headed hoes.  I miss him.  All right, here's the long intro.  Reverend Sharpton, I just want to ask you how you kind of grappled with this issue over  the last couple weeks.  You're a New Yorker through and through.  I'm not asking.  You're sensitive to the pain of the victims and the first responders.  But at the same time, you're a man of faith as well who has reached out to other faiths.  One, you have to first say, do you believe in what the country stands for? 
[01:13:30]  Do you believe in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution?  Then it's easy.  You can't say we believe in freedom of religion, but we're going to have certain areas that we  don't believe in that.  You can't have it both ways.  Second, I think that if you really want to heal the world and fight the terrorists from  a world that wants to be together, you can't do it by saying, but these people are excluded  in these areas.  So clearly, we're sensitive to those that lost their lives. 
[01:14:00]  All of us know people that work there and all of us know people that died there.  I had a kid live with us.  Nine weeks ago, his mother died there.  But I want to see that situation healed, and I want to see us stand against that kind of  thing.  I don't want to see it exacerbated.  And I think those that are erasing this controversy are exacerbating the very tensions and hatred  that's the climate these people operate in.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah, because they love us now.  You put a mosque there, and they'll all love us and stop bombing and stop fucking trying  to kill us. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, of course.  There was a mosque in that area when the fucking planes hit.  Yeah.  You dumb asshole.  What bothers me so much is the way that people defending the mosque are acting like every  act of terrorism is a logical response to the West's repressive or illogical behavior.  Right.  There's not one person on that side that says it is Islamic radical obsession with jihad and  with religious fanaticism, which does not respond to logic. 
[01:15:00]  Fucking dummies.  Sorry about the language.  No, it's infuriating.  We got Pete Dominick outside the studio.  Let's bring him in.  Yes.  Bring him Pete.  Yes.  Yeah.  Pete Dominick, of course, does a little radio here at SiriusXM, Monday through Friday,  3 to 6 p.m. on the POTUS channel.  What's up, Pete?  Hi, Pete.  I brought brownies for everybody.  Oh, nice. 
[01:15:30]  Me and my daughter's maid.  Thank you.  Hash brownies.  Apparently, there was a hair in one of them, but it's not mine.  Is it short?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Are we breaking first or are we doing this?  I got to pick.  Let's break and then we get Pete Dominick on.  Let's tease me.  Yeah.  We'll tease you.  Yes, the tease.  Don't forget POTUS channel, Monday through Friday, 3 to 6, XM 130, Sirius 110.  We'll continue with Pete Dominick next.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  No place to hide you, baby.  No place to run. 
[01:16:00]  You pulled the trigger of my mind.  Love, love, love.  Love, love, love.  What does he mean by that?  Pulled the trigger of my love gun.  I think he actually, according to, well, in 1977 when I got this record, you'd get like  a little paper gun with it.  Oh, you would?  With like a love gun. 
[01:16:30]  I would point at people and get molested.  I guess we're playing this because Gene Simmons is 61 years old today.  Wow.  61 for Gene, yeah.  Happy birthday there, you fucking prick.  Still holding a grudge, huh?  I don't blame you, though.  That's a fucking backstabbing asshole.  See, I hold a grudge because he had to, like, hold Danny's hand so Danny wouldn't type  anymore.  I didn't like that.  That's why I hold a grudge.  Against Danny?  I do, too.  Gene's talking. 
[01:17:00]  Shouldn't be typing.  The way he did it, too.  He leaned over a little, didn't even acknowledge or look at Danny.  He just put his hand on Danny's hand to make Danny stop typing.  Because he was making too much noise.  It was like, it was one of these moves.  And just as he's talking, he just didn't acknowledge Danny.  He just reached for Danny's hand.  He didn't even want to look Danny in the eye.  Like, stop it, jerk.  Gene Simmons is an asshole.  What an ass wipe. 
[01:17:30]  Can we play some Gene Simmons clips today in honor of his birthday?  My favorite is where, when Jimmy tried to share the banana with him.  That was a good one.  Gene was hungry and I had a banana.  What am I, selfish?  That is great.  That was a good one.  Can you find it real fast before we get into it with Pete Donovan?  With Jimmy sharing the banana.  Does anybody want a brownie, though?  It's actually, I had a teeny bite of mine.  It's very good.  Yeah, well, here it is.  In honor of Gene Simmons' birthday, check this out.  How was it?  I gotta be, because, you know, roasting Gene was, you know, you used to think. 
[01:18:00]  Can I take a bite?  Sure.  You can have the whole thing.  I'll actually share it with you if you want.  Oh, God.  Why would you share a banana with someone?  The question is, why wouldn't you?  Come on, Gene.  Do you hear the desperation in your voice?  If he would have put half in his mouth, I would have eaten the other half until I left  him.  Did you want the story that you once shared a banana with Gene Simmons?  Never occurred to me.  I gotta hear it again, because there's the, as a matter of fact, like, no, you can have 
[01:18:30]  it.  You can have it.  And then he thought, like, wait a minute, this is my opportunity to share a banana with  Gene Simmons.  I don't want to sound too excited, but I'm going to present it.  I'm going to put it out there.  All right.  Let's listen again.  You have to throw it out.  How was it?  I gotta be, because, you know, roasting Gene was, you know, you used to think.  Can I take a bite?  Sure.  You can have the whole thing.  I'll actually share it with you if you want.  Correction.  You cannot have the whole thing.  Two men can enjoy a banana together.  I'll actually share it with you.  You wanted to share your banana. 
[01:19:00]  I met my girlfriend's pussy.  Take whatever you want, Gene.  Hop in there.  Do what you gotta do, pal.  Oh, that is fantastic.  Wonderful.  What's up, Pete?  I just want Twitter followers.  Jimmy, Jim Norton has the fun.  I don't follow that many comedians.  I should, but I laugh my ass off at your Twitter.  People should, if they don't follow you, you have some funny shit that the Dr. Laura thing  was.  I forget, but I don't know if you did a lot, but there was one.  I was on the air on my show, not paying attention to my show, reading your Twitter. 
[01:19:30]  And I, like, squealed during, like, a poignant moment, and it was about that.  But I just, that's why I'm here.  Just to get Twitter followers?  I peaked.  I can't get anymore.  That's it.  Whatever the strength or weakness of my radio show, or anything else I have going for myself,  I'm done.  I'm begging people just to sign up, like, because the demographic that listens to political radio  is like 65. 
[01:20:00]  So I'm just, please create a Twitter account just to add me, so it looks like I have some  heat.  They don't like using those modern computers.  The demo.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they only go just so far.  They're not going to start.  Like, my dad likes the computer, but he's not going to get a Twitter account.  My dad says, what do I have to tweet about, or tweet, you know, pronounces it wrong.  But so I can't get any more.  So at Pete's Big Mouth, if I could get two new O&A Twitter followers, that would make my day.  That is the sad part of Twitter, because it shows you your place in the Twitter-verse. 
[01:20:30]  I never look at the...  My numbers are slowing down, too, man.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's all I'm going to get.  I never look.  At Pete's Big Mouth, please.  I don't even know how many followers I have.  See, you do.  I don't look.  You do.  I swear to you.  You have to.  I swear to you.  You know about.  No.  I have no clue.  Estimate.  Just guess, and then we'll find out and tell you.  I'm not going to look.  Done?  30,000.  30,000.  Yeah.  Do we have a...  Do we know? 
[01:21:00]  30,000.  Right on the nose.  Is it really?  How many do I have?  30,000 right on the nose.  No.  Oh, 42,900.  Wow.  I have 16.  1,000 or 16?  16.  16.  And seven of them are accounts I created.  Please add me.  Dude, I can't find that Dr. Laura tweet.  I wonder.  I hope they better not have taken it off.  They better not have.  I heard Facebook won't allow marijuana ads or something yesterday.  I read that.  Really?  Yeah.  They won't allow medical marijuana legalization pop-ups or something on Facebook. 
[01:21:30]  I can't imagine anybody saying you can't advertise this or that.  I can.  I can absolutely imagine them doing that shit.  If you go to some liberal blog, they'll have hardcore right-wing conservative campaign ads.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Because they just do whatever.  They don't censor.  They make money, and they know that people are interested in politics, and they put the ads up.  Yeah.  Whatever gives them money.  Whatever.  Why would Facebook...  You think most of the people on Facebook aren't smoking pot, aren't somehow... 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.  That is kind of an odd thing.  It's a weird one, right?  And the guy that runs it, like, 25?  Is it some kind of a morality thing?  Is this person that runs it, like, one of these...  What's more moral than smoking pot?  I don't know why they wouldn't allow that.  That's silly.  I didn't really read that much about it.  I just heard something.  I found the Dr. Laura tweet.  We're making it about me.  I never read my own tweets.  Well, please.  That one.  Please.  Is there only one?  I think so. 
[01:22:30]  Dr. Laura Schlesinger had to apologize for saying the N-word on her show.  What a headline.  Cunt.  Sorry for saying nigger.  I squealed at that.  You squealed?  I did.  I made, like, you know, that squeaky noise that you pee just a tiny bit with during...  when we were talking about some dead family or something.  Very cheesy.  That was really...  I'm looking up at a good day, New York, of course, and they're interviewing some gentleman  who is wearing the I hate white people outfit. 
[01:23:00]  Yes, sir.  He is Imam Sheikh Moussa Drama, Islamic Cultural Center of North America.  Cool.  I guess this guy is...  A moderate, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Comes down on an unpredictable side of the issue.  So you'd have no idea where he stands.  What is a moderate?  Is there a moderate?  A moderate Muslim is one who believes in swabbing your neck with alcohol before cutting  your head off. 
[01:23:30]  No, a moderate Muslim is like this imam here for this mosque at Ground Zero.  I think it's a guy who believes that he wants people to get along, but even a moderate will  always go in and find the asterisk, as we've been saying, as to why the U.S. brings it on  themselves.  Like, even a moderate, none of them will actually condemn for real the actions of radical Islam  without saying, but the U.S. must be...  But the U.S. must...  They were in here, and they spilt blood, and they did this, and they... 
[01:24:00]  All right.  We...  And then we as Americans have to sit there and go, well, we asked for it, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  It's a very subtle...  It's a very, very subtle root cause argument to justify the behavior.  So, there is...  So, a moderate Muslim is someone who, you say, won't...  They don't really mean it when they condemn?  No, they...  I think that they mean it.  I think that they don't like it because, most importantly for them, it makes the religion 
[01:24:30]  look bad.  But I think on some...  Terrorism.  Yes.  But I think on some level, they understand it.  Or they don't...  I would say that they wouldn't say it's a good thing, but they're like, well, when people  are pushed, you know, like, almost like when there's an abortion clinic bombing.  Maybe radical Christians agree with it, but most Christians go, that's despicable.  That's disgusting that he killed an abortion doctor. 
[01:25:00]  There's no, yeah, but the unborn...  It's like...  You know what I mean?  There's no excuse with it.  Yeah, there's...  So, I think even moderate Muslims get caught up in that.  There always seems to be some kind of...  Well, my...  One of the arguments that I've been making...  Now, for me to come on and ever defend religions makes my stomach turn because I'm a very anti-organized  religion.  I mean, there's certainly some good things in all religions, but I would prefer that we 
[01:25:30]  don't build any more mosques, churches, or synagogues at all.  You know, that's...  I would love that.  I mean, in many ways.  That being said, you know, the freedom to not go to church on Sunday is the greatest thing  in the world.  The freedom that I don't have to bore my kids and scare the hell out of them.  Scary monster stories of old.  Yeah.  To me, it's a great, you know, freedom that we have. 
[01:26:00]  And so, you have to, obviously, I think everybody agrees, defend the right to worship, right?  Of course.  The right to...  But the thing that I've...  One of the points I've been making, I've been making an argument, ironically enough, from  a national security point of view, which is all this protesting and hatred and rhetoric  and the signs and everything, it's not helping us become more secure.  You can't just win militarily. 
[01:26:30]  So, you know, I talk to a lot of national security guys, a lot of FBI, counterterrorism  specialists, and members of the military, and they say that's not helping.  All of that is not helping.  If we're trying to win hearts and minds in Afghanistan, seeing images like the ones we're  seeing from these protests and hearing all the hatred towards Islam, even if, you know,  there's nothing wrong with it, you can say whatever you want, it doesn't help.  It doesn't help the propaganda war.  And that, you know, that's coming from CIA and FBI agents.  So, basically, we're really writing bin Laden's next video script by being out there and 
[01:27:00]  saying you can't build a mosque.  How is it always our fucking fault?  It really is amazing.  I'm not saying it's our fault.  No, I mean...  I'm not saying you can't do that.  I'm saying it doesn't help.  You can't...  It's...  Anthony, it's just not that simple, this whole conflict, right?  I don't think Americans showing that they do not want this mosque being put where it's  going to be put, I don't think them protesting and showing signs hurts this at all.  I agree.  Hurts what? 
[01:27:30]  Hurts our relationship with people that hate us anyway.  It creates more people.  And it's a...  It creates more people to hate you.  No, no.  Of course it's so.  But I didn't make that up.  That's not my opinion.  That's the opinion of people who interrogate Al-Qaeda members.  But a lot of people would say...  But I'm saying, I'm not...  This isn't my opinion.  It's not how I feel.  But I bet there'd be a lot of law enforcement agents and FBI and stuff that would come out  and say, no, I am all for the protesting.  I don't want to see the mosque built there. 
[01:28:00]  I would love to have that guy on my show.  I would love to.  I'm searching him out.  I think there would be a lot.  What about the blame on Islam or radical Islam for creating the hatred?  It's almost like it implies that they're rational people and that it's not religious fanaticism  and that it is only by our actions that they react with hatred.  How about, for once, people look at it like it is radical Islam that is teaching that what we do is disgusting.  This is the same basic foundation of the religion that says these couple ran away together 
[01:28:30]  and they're disgraced their parents.  They should have rocks thrown at them.  But how do you become radical of any religion?  How do you become a fundamentalist of any religion?  What in life makes...  Let's talk about America.  What in life makes my crazy cousin become a born-again?  When she grew up a whore, when she grew up, you know, at what point does she say,  Oh, I found Jesus.  What brings her there?  What is it?  It's a person, a mentor, an experience, something.  It's some equally more nutty person who tells her everything she did when she had sex 
[01:29:00]  and when she was so wrong and she has to denounce them.  She has to raise kids that are just as nutty as she is.  And that's the same.  You said, you know, why not denounce the radical?  Why not...  See, you know, we live in different worlds, you and I, when we talk about these things.  Yours is more black and white and mine is more gray.  I think that's oftentimes a difference sometimes between conservatives and liberals.  If you, you know, but I like to understand why someone would ever hate America, want to attack America. 
[01:29:30]  I want to understand why that and because they're told shit about America that isn't true or they see imagery like Abu Ghraib.  No, no, but in a way, that's...  Hold on.  In a way, it's funny they're outraged about Abu Ghraib and yet they didn't have one ounce of balls when Saddam was torturing everybody in the country.  Of course they did.  That's untrue.  They tried to kill him.  That's not true, Jimmy.  They did it.  I mean...  A lot of people died protesting, trying to kill him. 
[01:30:00]  I mean, like, the way that they have come after the U.S. forces, there was not that kind of internal strife with Saddam was there.  Yes, there was.  Just because you say there wasn't doesn't mean there wasn't.  I think we would have heard about it.  There wasn't.  You can't say because I didn't hear something.  It didn't happen.  I hear that all the time.  You can't say just because it makes your argument that, yes, there was.  You can't tell me it can because I've seen it.  I've seen it and I've read about it.  It's the same type of fighting against Saddam's forces that are being used against where police stations are being constantly bombed and suicide bombings every day and truck bombings every day. 
[01:30:30]  Absolutely not.  I'll give you one piece of evidence.  Absolutely not.  If you want to give me a piece of evidence to Conor, I like to argue with real things, real things that happened.  After we went in in 91 and got them the hell out of Kuwait, we encouraged the Shias to stand up and go after Saddam.  We said, we got your back and then we abandoned them and they were slaughtered.  That is an example of them going after Saddam.  Thinking that we were backing them up.  You're right.  It was sickening that the U.S. walked.  I don't know why the U.S. walked away. 
[01:31:00]  I'm guessing because they felt other countries would not back us up in any type of a conflict there because of Israel.  The whole thing with Israel.  Saddam said if fucking Israel's involved, he's going to attack you.  There was a whole fucking thing with Israel where it was a very, very delicate balance.  So I'm guessing that might be it.  But that was disgraceful.  Kids walking around, 18-year-old kid, Muslim kid.  Let's say he lives in Egypt, right?  He doesn't have a job.  There's not much going on.  And somebody comes up to him and says, hey, why don't you come join our club?  He says, no, I'm not in Chanel.  You ought to come join our club. 
[01:31:30]  Well, check this out.  And he's a stupid kid who's got nothing going on.  And he sees these images from these protests.  He sees all the propaganda bullshit that they put together to radicalize these guys so they can become expendables for their disgusting cause and strap a vest on.  And it works.  Like the 19 guys that were actually.  Or the guys that were living here and guys that learned to fly planes.  These are not stupid men.  These are not uneducated men.  It's based in religious fanaticism.  They had a chance to see America.  Why did they do that?  A lot of them were stupid, Jimmy. 
[01:32:00]  That's irrelevant to me.  They were stupid.  That's irrelevant to me why they did it.  You know what?  I don't care why they did it.  Yeah, they were.  They might have been great at flying a plane.  But they were totally radicalized.  That makes, in my opinion, and I think you share, it's pretty stupid.  I don't care why they did it.  You should care why they did it.  Not at all.  It's not my business.  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  I think it's pretty simple.  To tell you the truth.  I think that radical Islam, and even some moderate Islam, the religion itself looks upon us as being decadent, evil people, just in the way we live. 
[01:32:30]  Fuck the signs.  Fuck the protests.  Fuck us doing whatever we do militarily around the world, the world police, whatever.  Just us living our lives, spending money, buying things.  Because they don't like that.  It's looked upon as being against their religion, against their God.  They have to live in shit because their religion tells them to, for the most part. 
[01:33:00]  And they look upon us as decadent people whose lifestyle is against what they believe.  And we have to be destroyed, much like Israel has to be wiped off the face of the earth.  What about the Netherlands?  So it doesn't matter what we do.  What about the rest of the world?  Why don't they feel that way?  We're the big boys on the block, is what it is.  The West.  So we're the, yeah, we are the...  But what I'm talking about, though, is how someone gets...  And by the way, they do have strife everywhere.  Everywhere Islam exists, there is strife.  And you can't, there's problems everywhere.  No, that has a lot to do with socioeconomics, and not as much necessarily... 
[01:33:30]  How about the religion is fanatical?  How about they are where Christianity was a few hundred years ago, but now weapons are more...  I'm not saying Christianity's had a better history.  It has to do with whether or not you have a resource, too.  I mean, there's not a lot of strife in Saudi Arabia.  They have...  Right, it's one of the richest countries, and they...  Right, and that's where most of the radicals come from.  So it's not based in poverty.  Not necessarily where most of the radicals come from.  Oh, dude, that's...  I can't say where most of the radicals come from.  The House of Saud...  You were the pilots.  Oh, that's right, all of them.  Dude, the fucking...  Not every one of them.  Not every one of them. 
[01:34:00]  The House of Saud is fucking...  But we didn't attack Saudi Arabia.  ...hanging on because of us.  No, we should have.  Here's...  But wait, wait, one thing at the time.  You're saying poverty in Saudi Arabia has a lot of money.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Bin Laden's a billionaire.  Al-Zawahari was a surgeon.  It doesn't matter about the money.  Let me ask you a different question.  How are we supposed to prevent terrorist attacks?  That's a...  If anyone knew that, it would be great.  But it's not...  But people do have a lot of ideas on how to do that. 
[01:34:30]  But it's not by letting mosques go up everywhere,  and not protesting, and not showing signs or imagery of this hate and Islamophobia.  That's not it.  Because just us living, us driving cars that are nice,  us having women that aren't wrapped up in bedsheets walk around in bikinis.  Listen, I don't necessarily disagree with...  They hate that.  I don't necessarily disagree with those things.  And want us killed.  And there's nothing we're going to do about changing the way we live. 
[01:35:00]  Should we do that?  I think we should care less about all the shit that we buy.  I think it's kind of gross in a way.  Granted, I'll sell out as soon as I have some money to buy a nicer car.  But at the same time, I'm not saying that the things you said are wrong,  but why pour a lot more fuel on the flames by saying,  you can't do this, you can't practice your religion here.  I'm not saying that at all.  You are not saying...  A lot of people are saying that.  No one is saying that.  No one is saying that. 
[01:35:30]  Everyone is acknowledging they do have a legal right under our Constitution  to build.  People are holding up signs that say things about Islam.  So what?  They burn effigies about George Bush.  It doesn't matter what they do, Jimmy.  If they're not America, we are a much better, more open country.  Again, that's our arrogance.  That's the arrogance of America.  We're better.  We should dictate to you.  We should figure out why you behave so naughtily  and somehow take responsibility for it.  I don't have that arrogance. 
[01:36:00]  I don't care why they act a certain way.  If they're minding their business, we should fucking mind ours.  It's very simple.  How come we're not invading over the fact that they're fucking throwing rocks at their women  for rape victims of being fucking killed?  They're barbarians in a lot of those places.  So I don't want to hear about how the U.S. should try to win hearts and minds.  I don't care.  You just said, when they start being like us, right?  No, I didn't.  What did you just say?  I don't know.  What did I say?  What did I say?  I forget exactly what you just said. 
[01:36:30]  The point I'm making is, the U.S. holds up protest signs.  People don't like something.  And we're so ingrained.  Political correctness has so ingrained us to believe,  don't speak honestly about what's bothering you.  Right, right.  I don't want to see any signs that say Muslims should be killed.  Honestly, I don't want to see that kind of shit.  But when they're holding up a bunch of signs saying that they don't like the fact  they're angry at Islam, good!  Be angry at Islam!  Why is it such a peaceful religion when all these acts are committed in the name of it?  But that's not the point I'm making.  And I'm not saying that people can't say however they feel. 
[01:37:00]  And you know, Jimmy, I'm not a politically correct guy.  No, I'm not saying you are.  But, that being said, the question is, how do we prevent future terrorist attacks?  Well, one thing we can do is try to prevent people from wanting to be terrorists.  And we have active propaganda right now the CIA uses all the time to prevent that,  one of which is sending this guy, who is the imam, over to many Muslim countries for outreach.  It's a great – the best place to practice Islam is America, is his message. 
[01:37:30]  That's propaganda.  Make no more mistake.  We're trying to convince them that being a Muslim in America is a great thing.  The CIA has a tough job.  The FBI has a tough job.  The other thing, of course, we can do is just spend a ton of money on counterintelligence.  And how about one time – this is what bothers me.  No one says they don't have the legal right to practice their religion.  And I spoke from personal spirit.  But that's how it's interpreted, Jim.  That's, again, not my problem the way they interpret it.  I can't – no, hold on. 
[01:38:00]  I can't spoon-feed other grown-ups.  Sometimes they have to take responsibility for their own thinking.  It's not the arrogant white America's responsibility to not only give them the message but feed it to them slowly.  No one is saying they cannot practice their religion.  The government should not get involved.  Offering them another place because it's in better taste.  But how about for once Muslims realize, hey, look, we know we have the legal right to do it.  But we also know maybe it comes off a little insensitive to victims' families this close. 
[01:38:30]  But how does it become insensitive?  We all know.  Jimmy, you guys hate it when you get painted.  We all know.  You guys all hate it when you get painted the same way any other radio guys do.  You can't stand being lumped in.  Jimmy, you can't stand being lumped in with some piece-of-shit hack comedian.  For you to say that this guy or any of the people, are you going to tell me that a billion people think the same way?  Pete, you understand.  Just because people worship the same way does not mean they're going to attack and kill people.  Right, but Catholicism is all taking the hit for the molestations. 
[01:39:00]  And they shouldn't.  Well, they kind of should.  Because by allowing that to happen, by them not lashing out, by them not punishing priests, they were in a way co-signing it.  Even though they weren't molesters, they were co-signing it.  And they thought the better good was to protect the religion.  Then why isn't anybody protesting a church being put up next to a school?  They're paying billions of dollars.  Why isn't anybody protesting, based on your argument, a church being put up next to a school or a playground?  I honestly cannot speak for why they're not protesting.  But because they're not protesting.  I don't see you out protesting at any playground.  I'm not protesting anywhere. 
[01:39:30]  But I talk and I speak my mind.  And you know why it's offensive.  Even if you agree with the mosque going up and you think that the greater good is that freedom of religion should, in your mind, you know why it's offensive.  Put it this way.  I don't know why it's offensive.  Put it this way.  Because they don't think that you...  Go ahead.  If there was a church going up next to a school where over 2,000 kids were raped in one day, there would be protests about a church going up next door to the school.  But that's a stupid thing to say.  No, it is not.  Because 2,000 kids were raped in your example. 
[01:40:00]  Yes, because 2,000 people were killed.  3,000.  Well, I'm talking at ground zero.  You discounted 1,000 people.  No, at ground zero.  No, there was way over 2,000, wasn't there?  Not a ground zero, I don't care.  Yeah, it was like 2,000.  2,000, I thought.  A little over 2,000.  You hate those 800 people.  Yes, they are.  They were awful people.  They were probably Muslims.  At least a third of the people who died were...  That's a great argument.  You're right.  A lot of Muslims died that day.  A lot of Muslim first responders died there.  Well, that just goes to show you the fucking savage nature of the terrorists. 
[01:40:30]  You know, we don't go and open fire on mosques in Afghanistan or in Iraq, yet they will run into a mosque with bombs strapped to them and kill everybody inside.  But it's a wonderful, wonderful religion.  What I'm saying is, you get a couple of thousand people that were killed, their families and people that were there don't want that reminder, that victory flag.  But here's the argument that you guys are both kind of making, though, and that a lot of people are making, and I think it's unfair. 
[01:41:00]  And again, I detest defending Islam or any religion.  I think Islam is reprehensible.  I think the Old Testament is probably more barbaric than the Koran, but that's only because I read it.  Now, to put everybody that worships one God or says they belong to one religion in the same painting and all with the same brush is not right.  That's why no one is saying burn the mosques.  No one is saying...  You're saying they can't have that mosque there, Jimmy. 
[01:41:30]  You just said it.  You're misquoting me.  The word can't is a huge word, and I have not said it once.  You said should not.  Huge difference.  Huge difference.  Shouldn't.  I stand corrected.  Shouldn't.  Absolutely shouldn't.  Shouldn't and can't.  Shouldn't implies it's their decision to make, and it's them saying we understand something.  Can't means it's being legislated by the government and violating freedom of religion.  You're saying they shouldn't build a...  Huge difference in those two words, man.  Right.  I agree.  And I'm not saying sweeping brush.  I agree with you.  But I'm not giving them a sweeping brush. 
[01:42:00]  I'm not saying round them all up and get them out of the country.  I'm not saying fuck Islam, they shouldn't be able to practice.  And they shouldn't be able to build a mosque because of what?  No.  Stop saying be able.  Again, you keep putting words in my mouth.  I'm saying from them.  They should say, this is tasteless.  We understand we have the right to do it.  We understand that legally and constitutionally, we have the right to do it.  But we also understand, because we've got common sense, why this is a little offensive or why it's upsetting to certain people. 
[01:42:30]  We want Islam and America to get along.  We want this whole thing to work.  We're voluntarily moving it in the interest of taste.  And that would be a huge public relations win.  Then get rid of them.  So stop saying can't and couldn't.  I'm not saying that.  Fair enough.  Should they then get rid of the other mosques downtown?  No, because we all know the difference between something that existed before and something that is being built.  We all know the difference.  Again, we know the difference.  It's a cultural symbol.  Have you ever been in a JCC on 79th Street in Amsterdam?  It's awesome. 
[01:43:00]  Okay.  It's got a great gym.  It's got a theater.  It's got all kinds of great stuff.  Flight simulator?  That is true.  I do disagree with the flight simulator.  Why is it always us who has to reach out with hearts and minds?  Why does it – like if Islam is embarrassed by this –  Because we're better.  See, again, I don't buy that American arrogance.  There's more of them than there are of us.  There's a lot more Muslims than there are Christians.  We have – we're better than every other country in that our Constitution gives us the freedom to speech, freedom to speech, freedom to press, freedom to worship. 
[01:43:30]  Are we really better at all?  I mean we practice one thing, we preach another, we tell other countries how to live.  We were telling other countries how to live when fucking blacks couldn't vote.  Come on.  We're not better than other people.  We're not better than other people.  We're not better than other people.  I'm talking about what – I'm talking about ideally what the Constitution says and just what our Constitution says versus what the British Constitution says.  I hear from Canadians saying you guys have freedom of press and freedom of speech.  That makes us better.  That part of our Constitution makes us better. 
[01:44:00]  You're right.  Do we practice it?  I don't believe it makes us better.  Not necessarily.  I don't believe it makes us better, and I really don't because with that belief comes the arrogance that we know better.  And with the arrogance that we know better comes this forcing our will on other people, and that causes all this resentment and hatred.  Now we're changing roles in these arguments.  I don't disagree with what you're saying.  I hate that.  I believe – I want our bases out of every other fucking country on this shitty planet.  And I don't care if they cut each other's throats every day of the week.  It's not my business.  I don't disagree with that.  I don't disagree with that at all.  I don't.  But we can't do that if we don't have another form of energy outside of oil. 
[01:44:30]  I just can't.  You're right.  But why wouldn't – why can't Islam for once say, look, we understand why this is tasteless.  Right.  We do love this country.  We were hurt by this too.  But we didn't realize it would be such a firestorm.  We'll voluntarily move it.  Do you know how much New Yorkers would embrace –  Why can't comedians just be original?  Why can't all radio shows –  Okay, because comedians who aren't original are selfish, selfish motherfuckers.  Right, but you just – you just fell into what I'm saying.  You divided comedians who aren't original. 
[01:45:00]  And you put – you said, why can't Islam for once?  And you put over a billion people into one category.  Well, I've seen no – I've seen differences in comedians.  I've seen no difference in Islam other than levels of justification for certain behavior.  I don't want to win that argument because if you haven't seen it, then it doesn't exist, Jim.  I didn't say it doesn't exist, but I haven't seen it.  I'm fairly aware.  But because you haven't seen it, saying I haven't seen something is not a good argument.  It's all I can argue from is what I know and what I've seen.  I'm not going to make up facts, dude.  Just to win an argument.  But if you read 75 articles a day on these things, then you'll know more. 
[01:45:30]  Okay, well, then you probably knew that this imam who was a moderate five years ago was saying that the U.S. has spilled more blood than al-Qaeda.  He was basically saying that al-Qaeda is better than –  That's true.  But the intent of what he was saying – sure, we're an older country.  What he was saying intent-wise was that the U.S. has no right to complain and that we somehow brought 9-11 on ourselves.  That's a very fucking subtle way of him saying we brought it on ourselves.  And that's a moderate guy.  That is not a controversial idea among –  Muslims.  No, among counterintelligence and CIA and military members. 
[01:46:00]  That is not a controversial view.  That we brought 9-11 on ourselves?  Every CIA person I talk to on and off the record says the exact same thing.  Well, Mike Baker didn't say it.  He's a CIA guy I know, and he didn't feel that way at all, that we brought 9-11 on ourselves.  And a lot of people, I think –  Note that I said every CIA guy I've talked to, not every CIA guy thinks.  And I can – again, I can only speak for the person I talk or the people that I know.  That's what I do.  I argue from my own point of view.  Pete, don't check your Twitter. 
[01:46:30]  You're down to 9 followers.  I just lost followers.  People just deleted.  You don't even want to know.  You started with 16 followers.  You're down to 9.  But it's amazing how this is how things get twisted up.  It's ugly.  I'll get you back.  There's a holy war going on with your Twitter right now.  But, dude, in the middle of – as we're talking, right?  Look at how it gets twisted.  You had me saying they can't or they shouldn't be able when I was saying – it's almost like – and you aren't doing it to be deceptive.  But in this weird discussion, all of a sudden, my intent was completely changed from saying, why don't they reach out a little bit, hearts and minds? 
[01:47:00]  And what you had me saying was they should not be allowed.  They should not be able.  They can't.  And I did not imply or say that.  You're right.  I misconstrued what you said.  But –  Pete, what would you say to the victims' families?  Well, I've heard –  Because they're the ones that are really affected the most by this whole thing, right?  Listen, I wouldn't say anything to them, man.  I wouldn't because I don't pretend to imagine what it's like to lose someone. 
[01:47:30]  Like this Cindy Sheehan, this lady who's protested war, she lost her son in Iraq, and a lot of people hate her.  Listen, I have two kids.  I don't pretend to know what it would be like to lose one of my children.  I listen to the victims' families and what they say.  And Ted Olson is this conservative Republican lawyer who defended Bush and Bush v. Gore and helped him become the president, of course, right?  And his wife, Susan Olson – Barbara Olson, I believe her name was – died on one of those planes. 
[01:48:00]  He said, I know this is going to make me popular, but I absolutely think that they should put that community center up exactly where they want it to.  So – and then I think probably the majority of the victims' families are against it.  I think probably –  The majority of Americans are against it.  But the majority of New Yorkers are not.  So it's – but, you know –  The majority of New Yorkers are against it?  Yeah, I thought they were.  Sure they are.  Well, we saw.  I thought they were not.  I thought it was 65 – around 65 percent.  The last one I heard was 54 percent, and then it went up to like 62, I think. 
[01:48:30]  Sixty-something percent.  I may be wrong.  But, you know what?  I don't really care what polls think.  You know, one in five Americans can't find America on a map and think that, you know, the sun revolves around the earth.  So I don't – I mean, you know, we deal with polls a lot, you know, in political shows.  And I just think that people are very misinformed or uninformed or apathetic or, you know – I mean, it's just the way that we are.  The way that I used to be and the way that I am on many issues still.  Well, my whole thing – my whole take on this is, like Jimmy said, they should realize that it's insensitive. 
[01:49:00]  It's completely legal.  I mean, as things go forward, that thing will be built where it's going because they have the legal right to do it.  No one's denying it.  Let me ask you about it.  It just seems to me to be very insensitive.  Let's change the argument then.  They're protesting a mosque in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, construction of a mosque.  They're protesting in Temeculia, California, in Tennessee. 
[01:49:30]  This is a wave.  I mean, this is –  It's because of this issue of Ground Zero.  But if you say – but if the argument is it's too sensitive, as both of you are making for their –  People are disgusted.  What is the argument for all the rest of the proposed mosques?  People are disgusted.  That's what it is because these protests were not happening.  I'm sure they happened occasionally.  What do you say about that?  What do you say about the people who are protesting mosques in other parts of this country?  Well, it's a little bit different than they would be doing to churches going up in those areas because they'd be burying them.  They'd be fucking beheading the people.  But look, I don't think that you should protest – this is a protest against the Ground Zero mosque, and I think that's what most people are doing. 
[01:50:00]  But again, you should –  I'm not asking you, though.  I'm not going to switch subjects.  I am answering.  I think that their protests against these mosques in different places are basically coming as a protest against the Ground Zero mosque.  To me, there's something they see that is such a slap in the face.  I can't even speak for them, but I'm guessing.  It's a slap in the face.  And anybody who's questioning their legal right to do it is wrong. 
[01:50:30]  And they do have the legal right to build mosques in other places.  And you know what?  I'll say this.  If Muslims, as I'm generalizing, don't want mosques targeted or people looking at them, then how about the imams don't make so many political statements?  How about the fucking – all of the political rhetoric and all of the rhetoric is coming from imams who work in mosques?  But they're not.  They are religiously –  But it's not –  Their law is based in religion.  You quoted Abdul Ralph in his political – you're saying how come they don't go out and make – most of them aren't very political. 
[01:51:00]  When he was asked questions, he gives answers.  Now, this guy was hired by the Bush administration.  He was hired by the Bush administration.  He was vetted by the Bush administration.  Well, they obviously made some really great decisions.  Come on.  I mean, they've made a lot of dumb decisions.  That doesn't validate him or invalidate him.  It means nothing to me.  Well, it does validate him if their State Department vetted him and said this is the guy that we want to represent Islam and the way it's practiced in America. 
[01:51:30]  Well, the guy who –  And the Obama administration as well.  They all –  Again, okay.  So they vetted him.  It doesn't matter.  I don't think he's a terrorist.  And I don't think that he would support terrorism outwardly.  I don't think that he wants to see innocent people slaughtered.  But he's one of those guys who always has to give the –  When asked, when asked.  But again, that's who he is.  That's almost like a priest saying – and I mean this.  You know, yes, there was a lot of allegations of sexual abuse and a lot of child rape. 
[01:52:00]  But, you know, when someone is deprived of women, in that but, he has subtly excused the despicable behavior.  Right.  How about no but?  How about the idea of sexually abusing children is disgraceful?  I think it's disgraceful to make the comparison you're making.  Why?  Because you have a lot of really –  Didn't you say that they wanted to build a –  You're the one that said, what if they wanted to build a church next to a school?  Didn't you say that?  So you brought the comparison in as well. 
[01:52:30]  No, no.  I'm talking about if one person from a religion did something, you shouldn't paint the rest of religion.  I agree.  That's why I made that point.  I do agree.  One person, you should not paint the rest of religion.  Right, okay.  So, what I'm saying is, it's not some crazy Muslim ideology  that our foreign policy has brought on blowback.  No one that argues that, and I'm one of those people who does,  is in any way saying it's okay to kill innocent people. 
[01:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  What we are saying is, hey, listen, as you just said, as you just said, when we go over in these countries,  Yes.  when we occupy their lands, when we give Israel $3 billion and they do what they're doing to the people in the Gaza Strip,  preventing them from having candy, okay?  When we put sanctions on Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of children died in the 90s,  that looks, if anybody did that to us, when we were attacked on 9-11, 
[01:53:30]  that was a military recruiting tool for the U.S. military, as it should have been.  Saddam, though, wait a minute.  That was the same argument the imam used, was about Iraq and the sanctions.  No, that's the argument Madeleine Albright used.  I don't care about, and by the way, what the U.N. fucking says.  She's not the U.N., she was the Secretary of State.  To say that the U.S. killed Iraqi children, Saddam killed Iraqi children, not the U.S.  The U.S. didn't kill Iraqi children.  The U.N. sanctions prevented them from having, that's what sanctions do, Jimmy. 
[01:54:00]  They're one way of convincing.  So the money that Saddam had, he gave to his military instead of feeding his people.  It was the same selfishness he had been displaying before.  And when we saw him doing that, why did we continue to allow those sanctions?  So I guess there was a weird choice.  Sanctions, lift the sanctions, or it's like the warlords in Somalia.  Lift the sanctions and let kids have medicine and food or not.  Yeah, it's a pretty simple choice.  Or overthrow Saddam and then get accused of occupying the country.  You can't fucking win. 
[01:54:30]  You didn't need to win.  There was nothing to win.  As far as I'm concerned, he should still be there.  And you know what, let him slaughter them.  I don't care.  Exactly, if Saddam was still there, Ahmadinejad would have been held in check.  When we went in there and got rid of Saddam, we destabilized the region and gave power to Iran.  And now, you know, people always joke.  I don't think the region was stable before.  It was definitely a lot more stable, Jimmy.  He went into Kuwait.  He was on his way into Saudi Arabia.  And again, we shouldn't have went there as like the lapdogs of Saudi Arabia. 
[01:55:00]  And fuck Kuwait too.  We shouldn't have bailed them out.  We should have let him take what he wanted out there.  And if the price of oil went up too much, then it had to be dealt with.  But honestly, I don't think we should have got involved.  That's why we went to Kuwait, because, Jimmy, the price of oil went up too much.  And it was going to go into Saudi Arabia.  And as you so intelligently offered earlier, and I'm serious, you said if they're going to cut off our shipping lanes to get oil,  which makes it going to be $20 a gallon, we've got to do something about that.  Just get an alternative energy source.  To be honest, we're going to Alaska.  I'm tired of oil slavery.  I really am.  Yes, let them be the way they were years ago and sit there in their piles of sand and create their own opportunity however they want. 
[01:55:30]  But take all our soldiers off the fucking DMZ.  I'm tired of 14,000 guys, all that money wasted keeping them between north and south.  Fuck Kim Jong-il.  I don't care if he marches north and bombs them.  I'm tired of us protecting everybody and incurring the fucking wrath and the disdain of the entire world.  Let them cut each other's throats.  Well, then you've got to start talking about our trade agreements as well.  Yeah, we wouldn't be – we're not in a position to do that. 
[01:56:00]  It would be great.  It would be very idealistic.  We should be positioning ourselves to do that, though, right?  As –  Slowly.  You're right.  As the big kid on the block, we can't do that.  You can't continue to be the big kid on the block.  No, I know.  You can't.  I believe me.  The tables are leveling.  I mean, we are not going to continue to be the big kid on the block if we don't have a middle class to buy shit.  Then let China be the big kid on the block.  Let them have a 15 – who else is rooting for this traffic jam to continue for the rest of time? 
[01:56:30]  Is that the greatest story?  All I hear is great things about China.  We don't understand the traffic jam, though.  Who would – I don't – how long is the average commuter in that traffic jam?  I don't get it.  Have you ever been on the expressway and turned and looked at a car that was doing 30 miles an hour?  In Beijing?  Yeah, well.  I thought you were going to say, have you ever been on the expressway in Xiaopeng, Bronx?  That's what I'm saying.  It's 10 days long now, right?  11 days long.  So is somebody in traffic for 11 straight days?  They said some people in 10 days.  I don't get it. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, I thought they weren't, but they said some people have been on the traffic for days.  There's no way to just abandon your car and make it worse?  That's probably what the traffic's from.  We can't allow – you're talking about we're the big kid on the block.  Not for long.  China just became the world's second biggest economy over Japan, which is strange.  How the hell was they?  But how did we allow that?  But, I mean, if we don't be the country to develop innovative renewable energy technology,  whether it be batteries, windmills, harnessing the sun, they will and we'll buy it from them. 
[01:57:30]  And we can agree.  This whole climate change thing is really the most under-talked about, most important issue in the world.  It doesn't matter what you think about climate change.  The rest of the world is moving forward with developing innovative technologies.  We've always been the leader on that.  We still are at the moment.  We're losing that.  We're losing the edge because this bullshit fight in Congress, this bullshit part is on an issue.  They don't have that stuff in countries like China that are basically capitalistic dictatorships.  They decide, this is what we will do, bang, and they fucking do it. 
[01:58:00]  They don't argue.  They say, we're going to sell windmills to stupid Americans because we get to.  And that's bad.  That's bad whether it be batteries, windmills.  So it doesn't matter.  The whole dumb climate change argument, which I don't think is dumb because I agree with science,  but who cares about that?  If you want to stay the big kid on the block, you've got to be selling shit to other people.  Pete, you just gained three followers.  Yes!  I'm watching it closely. 
[01:58:30]  Do they have my last name in their Twitter address?  More of that.  Pete's Big Mouth.  You just gained three on that one.  At Pete's Big Mouth.  Although you're down about 500 on your appearance.  The gross is negative.  But you just fucking gained three of those people back.  That, that, that, cha-cha-cha.  At Pete's Big Mouth, please.  But I don't think, I think the numbers are going up, but I don't think a lot of people  are liking what you're saying.  But the quality of the people.  Yeah, why do you unleash some of these people on me?  Oh, you want?  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  And let them listen to...  John wants them badly.  John in D.C.  Let them, let me have it, John.  Hey, John, how are you, brother?  Hi, what's going on, brothers?  Amen.  First off, before you say anything, John, would you ever have a drink with me?  Oh, dude, listen.  It's my turn to talk.  You sit there and you listen for a second, okay?  Listen, honestly.  The fact that you have opinions doesn't make you a douchebag.  And the fact that you're willing to come on the show and talk about them doesn't make  you a douchebag.  It's the fact that you spot your opinion, and when it's unpopular with the people you're  talking to, you say, every CIA, FBI, and military person I've talked to on and off 
[01:59:30]  the record agrees with me.  But that makes you a douchebag, because you're not willing to wear your own opinion that  you formulated.  I don't formulate my own opinion.  I don't formulate my own opinion on these things.  I don't...  Why would you form your own opinion on something you know nothing about?  Why would I have an opinion on a football team when I never played football?  Listen, listen.  I was agency for 16 years.  I'm one of these guys that you say agrees with you. 
[02:00:00]  No, I'm not.  I never talked to you, you stupid idiot.  I just gave Jimmy the point.  I said to people I've talked to.  Nobody agrees with you.  Did you call in when Mike Baker was on?  ...the hearts and minds of jihadists, you idiot.  The only way you keep a young man from jihad is to convince him that he's going to die,  that his parents are going to die, that his siblings are going to die, that everybody  he knows is going to die of he.  Jihad.  That's how you change people's minds.  And if you don't protest a mosque going up at Ground Zero, then you're telling these 
[02:00:30]  people that they're winning.  That's a propaganda war.  We are going to put a mosque on Ground Zero.  Have you ever been to New York, you stupid fool?  Have you ever been to New York?  Do you know where Ground Zero is?  It's insulting to New Yorkers when people don't know where those buildings were.  It really is.  Really.  Have you been to New York?  Yes.  Do you know where Ground Zero is?  It's because I've been down there twice to find out where this community center was  and where Ground Zero is.  It's two blocks and three minutes and 29 seconds away from Ground Zero. 
[02:01:00]  You're a douche.  You're a douche.  You don't know.  You don't have a fucking map and you don't know where those buildings were.  Where are you from?  You're a pseudo-intellectual.  I'm a radio-show.  I'm not a pseudo-intellectual.  I'm not an intellectual, period.  I aspire to be one, which is a good aspiration, I think, but I'm not.  To make your point, you say you've talked to CIA people who agree with you.  You, sir, are full of shit.  Nobody talks to you.  You read.  That's what you do.  You read.  You read the paper.  So this guy's telling me, is it not insulting to be told that you haven't talked to somebody 
[02:01:30]  that you've talked to?  I just got an email from an FBI agent yesterday who said, call me off the record.  His name is Gene.  Off the record.  I've talked to a lot of FBI people off the record.  You, sir, you talk to your dick.  That's who you talk to.  Well, I do.  I do.  Well, that's not incorrect.  That is a correct statement.  I have had many a conversation with my cock saying, why?  Why?  Did you call in when Mike Baker was in the studio?  Yes.  Okay, I do remember this guy.  He didn't like Mike Baker. 
[02:02:00]  So this guy, I think, actually was in the CIA.  You're in the CIA when?  He was.  Give me a second.  I have been absolutely fuming for half an hour.  Well, prove that you were in the CIA before you say that.  I mean, people can call them radio shaves and say they served, and they didn't.  You want me to show you my decoder ring?  What?  You want me to show you my decoder ring?  What did you say?  You want me to show you my decoder ring?  No, just tell me what you can do.  I'll give you any, by any metric you want.  People call radio shows and say things that are...  I was in Australia.  What? 
[02:02:30]  That's why I served my time.  What did you do?  I'm sorry.  I was talking over to you.  Go ahead.  I said I was in Berlin when the wall came down.  Okay.  I was in Japan, and I was in Australia.  That's why I served my time.  And what was your job?  That's what I did my thing.  He doesn't like talking about it.  I was in a job with you on a radio show.  No, no.  What?  You can say I was an agent.  C.I. guys.  Real C.I. guys.  C.I.A. guys don't talk.  No, no, no.  It has nothing to do with that.  It has to do with the fact that I don't like you.  Oh, well, fair enough.  Will you add me on Twitter?  Don't mention Twitter.  At Pete's Big Mouth. 
[02:03:00]  You're allowed to have your opinion.  You really are.  You just told me I wasn't.  You have to start wearing your opinion.  You have to start wearing your opinion.  But I don't.  But, you see, that's an interesting point, because my opinions, like, I'm not an intellectual.  I'm dumb on all of these issues.  I really am.  I'm a C average student, so what I do is I look at a broad range of experts on economics,  on foreign policy, on social issues, on anything, and I develop my opinion.  Like I said, football. 
[02:03:30]  Now I'm a big Jets fan.  I never played football.  What's more annoying than listen to a guy in a stand, some fat guy in a stand who never played football,  yelling at the coach?  I find that to be hypocritical.  So, me having a strong opinion, when I watch football, I ask, I'm like, why would they put that running back in this play?  This is like building a stadium for the Jets in Boston, Massachusetts.  Now we understand.  Now, wait, can I ask you a question?  45 new followers, by the way, Pete.  45 new followers.  Do you guys have a bad relationship with the Cringe Humor guys? 
[02:04:00]  Because I wanted to plug.  They asked me to host a show, and I'm hosting the Cringe Humor show with Nick DiPaolo's headline tonight at Comics,  and I wanted to plug that and ask this guy if he'd like to go.  I'd buy him a drink with poison in it.  No, we don't have a bad relationship with those guys at all.  All right.  Patrick and those guys are great.  Oh, okay.  So, Cringe Humor's show tonight at Comics.  I wanted to make sure I plug that for him.  Very cool.  John?  Yeah, buddy.  What else there, buddy?  You good?  Well, you know, hey, listen, just a quick comment, and I'll punch out.  You can be an armchair quarterback all you want, but the difference is, I don't know if you heard me, 
[02:04:30]  a guy that says they shouldn't have thrown that bar doesn't say,  yeah, I was talking to Mike Schumer last week, and he told me the same thing.  If you're an armchair quarterback and say I'm an armchair quarterback,  don't start bringing it up.  Don't bring up X-C-I-A-C-I-A-F-B-I and all these people,  and then say, matter of fact, I just got an email from an FBI guy,  and you should look like a douche.  I'm fine with looking like a douche.  I think I generally look like a douche three hours a day.  I don't care what I look like, man.  That's the difference between you and I, perhaps.  I don't.  You do care. 
[02:05:00]  No, I really don't.  I'm a stand-up comedian for 15 years.  If I cared what I look like, I would have done something else.  I wear my heart on my sleeve and tell people exactly what I think,  and when I'm wrong, I'm happy to say I'm wrong.  When I sound stupid, I'm happy to say I sound stupid.  We were talking about the Bush tax cuts yesterday,  and I started making a point, and then I just fumbled the ball  and sounded like an idiot, and I'm like, you know what?  I have no idea about economics, and when I talk about it,  you should never listen to me or my opinion on it.  Here's the problem with this guy.  He does the same thing.  I was a stand-up comedian for 15 years.  It's like, dude, listen, just make your point. 
[02:05:30]  Quit trying to earn credibility where there is no credibility to be earned.  Nobody gives a shit if you're a comic for 15 years.  Nobody gives a shit.  I shouldn't make any arguments with you because nothing matters.  I'm trying to share, like, my, you know, why.  I tried to, you said you're a douchebag and you care,  and I said, listen, I agree that I'm a douchebag, that I am.  I agree that I'm a stand-up comedian who some idiot gave a political talk show to.  That, in a way, makes me a douchebag.  No, you're very passionate about it, though.  Yeah, but you believe what you say. 
[02:06:00]  I believe what I say, and that changes a lot.  Sometimes I believe something, and then that belief will change.  Remember that the next time you yell at me for having backed Bush.  It's a passion of your belief that I have a problem with.  I love people who are passionate about their beliefs.  What I hate, and, you know, you're a lot like this,  whether you think you are or not, intellectuals often will make...  I'm not an intellectual.  Why would anybody call me an intellectual?  Why would you call me that?  What makes me an intellectual?  I want to be an intellectual.  Yes, I am a wannabe. 
[02:06:30]  Now, Bob Bayer is a CIA agent.  I don't mind giving you his name.  You guys don't understand that we'll respect your opinion  as long as you're passionate about it.  The minute you start trying to earn credibility by saying,  I talk to all these people who agree with me, well, you know you.  They don't agree with me.  I talk to them, and I agree with them.  They don't, I don't give them, I don't tell a CIA agent how it is  and he says, you're right.  He tells me how it is.  Who do you agree with me?  Bob Bayer.  You know Bob, right?  Bob Bayer?  Who doesn't know Bob Bayer?  Well, that's the guy I talked to. 
[02:07:00]  So you said earlier, I don't talk to CIA agents.  Okay.  That's one guy I talked to on and off the record.  You can read his books, bro.  You can read his books.  Read his books.  He's got like three books.  He wrote the movie Syriana.  All right, John.  He's friends with George Clooney.  So basically, you read his books.  I read his books, and I got interested in him, and I talked to him.  Michael Shoyer.  Do you know who Michael Shoyer is?  Michael Shoyer is the head of the Bin Laden agent.  He's the head of the Bin Laden.  You know who Michael Shoyer is, right? 
[02:07:30]  I was talking to Stephen King last week.  But you know who Michael Shoyer is, right?  This guy's such a smart ass.  Brother, listen, listen.  Do you know who Michael Shoyer is?  We're not going to play a name game right here, okay?  Because you're in the CIA, and you don't know who Michael Shoyer is.  What I'm saying is, just fucking stop.  Just wear your beliefs and wear your opinions.  Don't throw people like us under the bus to make your point or to sound believable.  That's what I'm saying.  Stop doing that, because it pisses us off.  I don't do it.  You perceive me to be doing that. 
[02:08:00]  My opinions are that the things I believe are informed by experts who have real-life experience and academic degrees in them.  That's where I get my opinion.  What the hell would I know about any of this?  Every time I disagree with you, you didn't argue for your stuff.  You said, but I've talked to all these people, and they agree with you.  Yes, I do that all the time.  I love it when people do that.  I love it when people say, rather than I think something.  You have an understanding of politics that I wish more people had. 
[02:08:30]  What's that?  I said, and has an understanding of politics and the way people think.  From a counterintelligence standpoint, and is usually right on.  Oh, look at that.  Can you say something nice about me, too?  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, my man.  I love you, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  I love you, buddy.  I love you.  I listen to you guys every day.  I'm going to punch you out now.  All right, John.  Thank you.  We're going to go to a Marine Corps vet.  Who's this?  Hey, this is Joe in New York.  Yeah, sure it is.  We've got Pete Dominic on the air today.  Who does his own political talk show. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, what time is your show on?  Pete's on POTUS.  POTUS, Monday through Friday, 3 to 6.  3 to 6.  XM 130 Series 110.  It's an entertaining show.  I've done it.  Pete likes to argue.  It's a good show, man.  You think he likes to argue?  I like that about him.  You know what I did the other day on the show when we pulled out of, you know, we started  pulling these troops out of the room.  Bad-mouthed America.  I hated America.  I burnt a flag, which is bad for radio.  So, no, I asked guys like the guy that, the Marine Corps vet that's on the phone.  I don't know when or where he served.  But I said, you know, like, I don't know a lot of what we're talking about. 
[02:09:30]  For example, in Iraq.  Like, I've never been to Iraq.  I've never been to Afghanistan.  I've never come anywhere near the military, nor has my family.  My dad was Army Reserve.  So I said, I said on the show, what did we gain from our invasion in the last seven years,  you know, our time in Iraq, right?  And I said, I don't want anybody to call me, but members of the military who served in Iraq,  because they're the people whose opinions I think really count.  And if you want to call that some loaded question or liberal point of view, fine. 
[02:10:00]  But that's what we do on our show, because I don't know necessarily.  I have my opinions, I have my ideas, which are informed.  But I was much more informed after talking to about, I don't know, 15 Iraq veterans.  So if you serve in Iraq, I said, what did you learn?  What did we gain?  We had a really, really interesting conversation.  Can I give you a Marine Corps answer to that question, sir?  Did you serve in Iraq?  Yes, sir.  I'm a three-time Iraq veteran and a two-time Afghanistan veteran. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  I'm a Marine Corps, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine.  God.  Thanks for your service.  Do you have a wife?  Yes, I have a wife and three kids.  Wow.  So now you're driving around in a minivan.  Yeah, I do.  Holy shit.  You're a Marine Corps vet in a minivan?  How do you handle that with the shit you got to do over there?  I keep my Humvee in the garage.  Do you have a Semper Fi sticker on the back of your minivan?  Right on.  What do you got for Pete, sir?  Okay, just a couple of points.  Now, the political side of things about Islam aside, I don't mind you taking the apologist's point of view, and let me finish first, that we may have given reason to radical Muslims for hating us. 
[02:11:00]  I don't mind you saying that as long as in the same breath you acknowledge the fact that Islam as a whole and as a culture, and we're talking a global culture, has a very, very, very big problem that no other culture on the face of this earth has. 
[02:11:30]  You have radical imams and mosques and madrasas all over the world who crank out these radical, impressionable, lunatic fundamentalists who are willing to kill people based on who they are.  That is a simple fact of Islam.  There is a lot of moderate Muslims out there, but until all of those moderate Muslims get together and publicly meet these animals head on and distance themselves from them and take back this peaceful religion that was so-called hijacked from them, until that happens, and until we're all honest about it and say, yes, this needs to happen, 
[02:12:00]  the problem is never going to go away.  That is a simple fact, and until we get past this whole political correct fear of offending anybody because of what they might do, that is the core of the problem that Islam has, and no other religious group or culture on the face of this earth has a problem that bad. 
[02:12:30]  That's a fact.  You cannot debate any of that.  For all our faults, I'm with you on that.  But again, that can't be the excuse, and if you're going to, you know, spew one part of the equation out of your mouth, you damn well better acknowledge the other side of it.  That's all I got.  Good point, sir. 
[02:13:00]  Good point.  Yeah, I mean, I generally don't.  And he's out.  I generally don't end my opinion with that's a fact and you can't debate it.  I find there's not much you can say after that.  But, you know, I don't disagree with much of what he said about that there's a lot of radical, horrific imams all over the world.  But if you look at the way Islam is practiced in America, I mean, you really don't see that that much in America.  Yeah, the blind cleric, he was very rich.  Of course, you can point out a handful of people, but generally in mosques across this country, if you've ever been to one, I mean. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, the one in Buffalo, there's no problem with that one.  You could point out a handful.  You could point out a handful.  But you could point out a handful of any religion being bad.  I mean, you could point out a handful.  Yes.  But generally, Jimmy, you agree with me that Islam is practiced very peacefully.  Much bigger hands full.  But they run and own businesses in this country and they do it responsibly.  They raise families in this country and they're generally, overwhelmingly, I should say, in America, very peaceful. 
[02:14:00]  And they came to America for the reason to make money, to have a better life.  That's the reason why most people come here.  All right, let's go to Jay in Jersey.  By the way, one of my favorite Colin Quinn lines ever on Tough Crowd, he was talking about Islam.  He's like, you know, and to be honest, you can't let a few million bad apples spoil the bunch.  That was a few million bad apples.  Jay in Jersey.  Jay in Jersey.  Jay in Jersey.  Jay, what's up, boys?  What's going on?  Hey, brother.  First of all, I've got to say one thing.  The guy who called before to blast Pete on, you know, the ex-CIA guy, he's blasting him saying that, well, he's basing his opinion on who he's talking to and he shouldn't be doing that. 
[02:14:30]  The last time I checked, and he agreed with Anthony's side because Anthony agrees with him, apparently.  The last time I checked, Anthony's political experience was based on how much he wants to fuck Ann Coulter.  He doesn't have any.  He's an intelligent guy who knows what he's talking about.  Why can't Pete use that same experience that he does?  I don't mind you saying any of that except for the fact that Anthony's an intelligent guy who knows what he's talking about.  Really? 
[02:15:00]  Because I have to make eye contact with him every day.  Humiliating.  So I've got to say this, guys.  I was an ex-first responder.  What the hell does this guy want?  What's up?  What's up?  An ex-  No, I'm going to move, but give me a second.  All right?  I'll move for you.  All right, no problem.  What's that about?  Tell him you were a first responder.  The Muslim's making me move out of the front of his head.  Goddamn Muslim.  So here's the deal, guys.  I was a first responder on 9-11.  Anthony, you yelled at Stryker yesterday that he's forgot, he's forgot. 
[02:15:30]  I can't forget.  I got, you know, I got shit in my head, man, that I've seen that I smell still to this day.  You know, 9-11 comes around, I get a little fucked in the head over it.  But I think the problem is here, I agree with their right to build it.  I don't agree with them wanting to build it.  I don't think they should build it, which I think is the argument everybody's had.  But there is a large amount of people who are going on this that they should not be allowed to build it. 
[02:16:00]  That the government should step in and say, no, you can't build this.  And I think that's the problem.  Yes, there are a lot of people down there who are just saying that they shouldn't build it.  And they have the right to sit there if this thing gets built and protest every day.  Hey, can I ask you a question, buddy?  Not to interrupt you, but I have not.  You may be correct.  There may have been people who said they should not be allowed to build it, but I have not seen or heard any of that.  I've heard everyone who's against it preface it, and especially all the politicians, with saying this is not about freedom of religion. 
[02:16:30]  We don't think that they shouldn't have the legal right.  Yeah, I know the argument that I have.  I'm in a field where most of the guys I work with are very conservative.  I am not a liberal at all.  I consider myself an independent.  And I can see, like I said, both sides of it.  And a lot of people call me a censator for having that attitude.  It's, I don't know, it's, I think the people I talk to, and like I said, these are people who are going to be a little bit more open because they're not out on the news necessarily where somebody can sit there and say they're trying to hold back a religion. 
[02:17:00]  They want to kill Muslims.  But a lot of the guys I do speak to wholeheartedly believe that these people should be just packed up, shipped out, and sent away.  Now, again, I think it's a barbaric religion.  I really think that they're a bunch of, you know, maniacs.  I am a self-hating Christian.  I basically abandoned my religion years ago because of my own issues with it.  You know, these people, they, yes, there is an issue with them, but they do have the right to practice religion.  I know you guys have never said that they don't have a right to practice. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, we've said that.  It's a big, a big underlining feeling that that's what people really want.  And it's tough.  And like I said, you know, the one thing he had said before is that we need to understand why they hate us.  We do need to understand.  That's one of the, a big thing in dealing with an enemy is to know why they hate us.  Not to agree with it.  Not to sit there and say, well, it's our fault.  But you need to know why, and there's other ways to deal with it.  It's because we're, we are.  Because we're Americans.  That's why we're hated. 
[02:18:00]  I guess that's a good point.  And Pete was right to, knowing, knowing why they hate you doesn't mean you're, I almost said kowtowing, but I won't, but bending to their will.  But knowing is, is obviously a good way to combat it.  Okay.  Do you really think that Obama says something only because he feels like he wants to say that?  I mean, everybody's involved in any kind of statement he makes about this.  Now, do I wish he would have came out and said, these people have the right to build this place there.  They absolutely can do it.  I would hope that he can consider people's feelings. 
[02:18:30]  I don't, you know, I didn't hear his, what exactly he said.  He did say that, but let me ask you and everybody else should ask themselves this question about the rest of the mosques being protested, their construction in the rest of this country.  Because people lose on this argument a lot.  They shouldn't have, they should be more sensitive.  Okay, fine.  Forget about New York.  What about the rest of the country?  What do you think about that?  And you can answer that and everybody should answer that.  I'll answer it before this guy.  Islam is, by doing this, these Muslims here are hurting their cause because they're making it look like Muslims don't give a shit about the victims' families. 
[02:19:00]  And the appearance is that Muslims don't care about what other Americans want and want to come here and not assimilate and that they don't think like us.  That's what the message they are sending.  The appearance is that we hate Muslims because we drop bombs on their countries.  That's the appearance.  Funny, that wasn't the appearance we were fucking funding bin Laden to fight the Russians or we were fucking...  We did not actually fund bin Laden.  We allowed him to be funded.  I just read that in Steve Cole's Ghost Wars.  I used to always say that.  That's a popular misconception. 
[02:19:30]  That is the best book I've ever read.  Also, when we were fucking helping Muslims with Slobodan Milosevic, Muslims have never shown one ounce of fucking gratitude for any help.  That is a really ignorant statement to make.  Kuwaitis love us.  Really?  I've been there.  They were fucking lazy, those cocksuckers.  They were lazy.  Took them four hours to bring us through customs.  They stay Kuwaitis.  You know that's not true, what you just said earlier.  That they've never shown appreciation.  What has Kuwait done?  What have they done?  Thanks.  Jim, is it not true? 
[02:20:00]  They've never said...  They've never done anything to thank us.  They've never said anything.  They maybe...  Who cares what they say?  Thank you.  How about Saudi Arabia not being such cocksuckers and raising oil prices?  Fuck the whole Middle East.  I'm tired of oil.  Are they raising oil prices?  They have been the whole time.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  They're ungrateful fucks.  All of them.  I'm sorry, man.  You answer the question.  I didn't mean to start babbling.  He's out.  He's out.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  I got a lot of new Twitter friends that I want to thank.  All five of them.  Five.  You'll get more, man.  At least five.  Not really.  At Pete's Big Mouth is my Twitter. 
[02:20:30]  Opie just deleted one.  How did you get into my...  No, there's...  He says, Opie just deleted one...  We hate Pete Dominick is doing really well on Twitter right now.  I mean, really well.  If they get more followers, if we hate Pete Dominick gets more, I will kill myself on the  show tomorrow.  Then Pete's Big Mouth?  Oh, man.  Game on.  Game fucking on.  Oh, I want to apologize.  Someone started We Hate Pete Dominick.  Oh, that's great.  Larry D. in Boston, so...  Oh, fuck.  That is so helpful.  Hello.  Hi, this is Harry Tasker. 
[02:21:00]  I want to say I agree with everything Pete is saying.  I'm with the CIA, too.  I heard it.  It sounded like Arnold.  Harry Tasker.  Let me see how you did, Pete.  You got his name in that?  Harry Tasker?  Harry Tasker.  How many followers did you have before you hit the show today?  I think like...  I want to say like 13.  It might have been 1,200.  I think it was about 13.  I saw 13.  100, 1,000.  You've gained 100 followers today, sir.  No way.  100.  You're up to 1,424.  No, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's huge. 
[02:21:30]  I thought you said 1,600.  Or 1,400.  No.  1,200.  1,300.  But Pete, our audience is weird.  We have people that follow us just to hate us, which is really bizarre to me.  So enjoy all the hate.  Oh, yeah.  There will be a lot of hate.  You'll be blocking your ass off later on this afternoon.  Because as a comedian, again, I've got to go back to that.  I enjoy the attention.  I enjoy hate or love.  There will be a lot of hate.  Just God bless you for knowing...  Why do you hate yourself?  I exist.  If you Twitter funny stuff or whatever, and people follow you just to be entertained.  It's like whether it's political or funny or both. 
[02:22:00]  I try to combine it.  Like, I'll throw out real opinions or angry opinions along with fucking 10 jokes in a row  just to try to...  I don't want it to be preachy.  Along with shit jokes.  How is Twitter affected, like, stand-up?  Because, you know, when something happens and we all go do a joke about it that night,  if you're good, you go out and you do a joke that night or an hour later, right?  Yeah.  But now, when something happens, anybody with a sense of humor can write a funny joke about  it.  Sure.  And then you have to be careful that yours wasn't similar to what somebody tweeted or... 
[02:22:30]  Or, I mean, how does it affect your stand-up?  Not at all.  Like, Twitter.  I'll tell you honestly, I don't think about what audience members or what Twitter people  will write.  The fact that everyone's Twittering about something will mean that they're more likely  to be aware of subject matter immediately, so it's kind of more interesting to talk about.  Like, Mel Gibson.  I talked about Mel.  I'm sure there's a lot of funny things about Mel.  Right.  I do eight minutes on Mel Gibson.  I don't care what they wrote on Twitter.  It's probably helped you write jokes, because you write the joke on Twitter.  I have actually used a few Twitter jokes on stage, but I don't write that way.  But, like, something I think might work on stage after I've Twittered it, I've done 
[02:23:00]  that, too.  We've got a break, man.  I'm going to pee my pants.  Pete, what do we need to promote here for you today?  I watch you on CNN's John King, by the way.  I'm on CNN's John King USA.  He's a dullard.  You give it a little pop with your segment.  At the end of the 7 o'clock hour every night, I do that segment on CNN called Pete on the  Street.  You really...  He should be bowing to you.  He's an easy guy, actually.  You should be bowing to him.  But I...  You stand out on that show, is all I'm saying.  Thank you very much.  This is actually a compliment for you, Pete.  I really appreciate it.  Yes, it really is.  How do you not stand out with this head on TV? 
[02:23:30]  But, yeah, just try to listen to the show.  Contribute to our discussion.  What is POTUS on?  What channels?  3 to 6 p.m.  3 to 30 on XM, Sirius 110, Monday through Friday, 3 to 6.  And I'm hosting tonight at Comics, Nick DiPaolo's headlining the Cringe Humor Show.  Mike DiStefano's on there.  Wow, you guys have...  Oh, Mike's doing it, too?  Yeah.  Okay, that's a good job.  Well, you and Nick have very similar political opinions, huh?  I can tell you, great Nick.  Holy shit.  Nick is actually...  Nick and I don't agree on anything, but I happen to think he's one of the funniest people  to ever, ever... 
[02:24:00]  You know, to do stand-up, but hanging out with him is...  You know, I love him.  Yeah.  I love Nick.  Very good.  Okay, we're going to take a break.  Continue.  Stay there.  Yeah, this is the O.P.D. Anthony Show.  Damn it.  I stand alone  Every thing that I believe is made  And I stand alone  In spite I 
[02:24:30]  Stand alone  Oh, bud.  God smack.  God smack.  Our old friends.  Do you hang out with Sully still, Jimmy?  Do you see him from time to time?  I haven't seen or talked to Sully in a while, but whenever I do Boston, he comes, and I'll  always get a weird text from Sully.  Yeah.  Every few months or twice a year, three times a year.  I change...  This is my new number, dude.  Don't give it to anybody.  Like, I don't know if he's got something weird going on, but Sully texts me. 
[02:25:00]  Probably some psychopath.  Yeah, we text back and forth.  I haven't talked to him in a while.  Yeah, they're torn, and then Sully's got some solo shit going on.  Oh, yeah?  I want to listen to some of that solo shit.  I bet it sounds like this.  Nah, man.  Really?  He gets mellow.  What is solo stuff?  Takes it down a little?  Yeah, I think...  Some ballads?  Showing off his voice.  I've not heard any of the solo stuff.  As good as the Sinatra I was listening to in the bathroom?  Oh, enough of the Sinatra in the bathroom.  I would have stuck more when I left him in the toilet or what was coming out of the  fucking speaker.  Most overrated fucking performer ever.  Frank Sinatra?  Over... 
[02:25:30]  Bites your tongue.  He doesn't suck, but he's the most overrated.  He's terrible.  He's the most overrated guy ever.  Yeah, Hoboken.  Great.  I told Jimmy, leaving the bathroom, what I'd like to imagine when you hear a nice Frank  Sinatra song or whatever.  I was going to add another artist there and realized I don't really know that genre too  well.  What's up for the other artists we got?  Pete Como.  Perry Como.  Oh, was his name Perry?  Yeah, Perry Como.  You picture that, you know, there was debauchery going on as that music was going through the 
[02:26:00]  speakers of a car.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There was finger banging and some dude trying to get it in her ass.  Blowjobs.  As that nice shit was playing on the radio.  Blowjobs.  Yeah.  You know, some girl was taking urine on her chest.  Oh, yeah.  In some make-out point somewhere.  When that was brand new.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  It was always debauchery, right?  The music made it sound like it was a romantic era.  Oh, everything was romantic, yeah.  Hey, John in D.C. writes, he was the guy on the phone, the CIA guy, Northern Virginia. 
[02:26:30]  He writes, hey, I hope I didn't fuck the flow of the show.  I was boiling mad and went off on a tangent.  Thanks for putting me on.  And he goes, I love you too, buddy.  Which was very nice as well.  Nah, John, you were cool, man.  Don't worry, John.  You're not passionate.  You know, before we put this Ground Zero mosque to bed for a little while, I think we need  Oscar's opinion on this.  I really do.  I think the people need Oscar's opinion on this.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Kenny, drag that motherfucker in here.  Where is he? 
[02:27:00]  Oscar, of course.  And we didn't allow him to prepare.  I don't even know how to.  Oscar.  Hello.  We're losing you soon, so we're using you a lot on the radio this week, because we're  sad to see you go.  Oh.  The Ground Zero mosque.  I heard you have a lot of opinions on this, and I think it's time that our audience hears  them.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, man.  I had a lot more last week.  I just...  Why?  In one week, your opinions went away?  Yeah, no.  I just bumped into a couple things, so it was like my head is all over the place. 
[02:27:30]  But if you have opinions on something, they should stay in your head, don't you think?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Just a little.  I mean, yeah.  So what's your thoughts?  Where are you at with the mosque?  I don't know.  I guess...  I mean, I'm going to agree with most of the people.  It's a sensitivity issue, and it's just...  A sensitivity issue?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean...  Like what?  Well, no.  Just...  I mean, some people feel strong.  We're supposed to be sensitive to Islam?  No, no.  Not to that.  I'm what I meant to say.  It's just there's people that feel like, hey, you know what?  I lost a family member there, and then just to build a mosque there is just kind  of like a slap in the face.  You sound like retarded Mars. 
[02:28:00]  Do I?  Yeah, so...  So I don't know.  I think it's...  Yeah, it's kind of just...  I don't know.  It just shouldn't be...  Yeah, it shouldn't be...  It shouldn't be what?  Built there, I guess.  Built there?  Yeah.  Why, man?  Why?  In the Constitution, you have that right.  No, okay.  What are you talking about?  Not just me.  I mean...  Are you a racist?  No, no, no.  I'm a racist.  No, no.  No?  Who do you hate, though?  No, no.  Everyone hates one group out there.  What race?  What race or group do you hate?  Exactly.  I guess people just can't drive. 
[02:28:30]  That's what I hate.  So you are racist, the Asians.  So Asians, right?  Wow, you don't like Asians?  No, you know what?  All right, check it out.  Fat black women?  You don't like...  Everyone but whites?  Yeah.  No, one day I was at this parking garage, and this...  Clearly, the lady was from...  I'm going to say Chinese, because somebody that I know knew her...  Wow, he really hates the Asians from Chinese.  Oh, wow.  No, but then...  Why don't you just call chinks?  You know you want to.  No, no, what the...  Well, okay.  Oh, my God, you're a racist. 
[02:29:00]  So what I was saying is...  What did they ever do to you, sir?  Oh, no, nothing, nothing.  That's just what I'm trying to say is just going back to the driving thing.  Yeah.  So then she was driving, and she was backing up, not even looking in her rearview mirrors.  Ah, they do that.  Yeah, okay.  Because their eyes are slanting.  They can't see, right?  Well, I don't know if that has something to do with it.  Maybe there's some physics involved or some...  Yeah, yeah.  What do you think it is?  Well, of what?  Of what we're talking about?  What is it?  What?  Oh, with the Asians?  No.  With what?  The other...  What we were saying.  Oh, with the... 
[02:29:30]  With the mosque.  No.  Why do you think the Asians back up without looking?  I don't know.  I think it was just that particular lady.  You have an opinion on that.  I mean, yeah.  So you've got to have freedom of religion, man.  You know that.  Yeah, no, absolutely.  Yeah, no, absolutely.  That's why there was nothing wrong with, I mean, freedom of religion.  What?  The Chinese, though, driving?  Yeah, yeah.  I just did.  The one time, it was just...  A lady was backing up.  It's almost like if you don't allow it, the government can't just come in and regulate it.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.  Why?  Oh, what?  Wait, I'm confused.  What are we talking about?  I'm just...  Why are you confused?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  It just works.  He doesn't like me, man.  This kid doesn't like me.  No, no.  I don't think he does.  Why don't you like Jimmy?  I don't think he does.  Most people love him.  He's a sweet boy.  Why don't you like Jim Norton?  I don't know.  I get a weird vibe on him.  You don't like me?  You don't like Jimmy?  Yeah.  A lot of people get weird vibes when I'm in the elevator, too, because he's just like...  Yeah.  And I try to make...  It's not weird vibes.  They just don't want you to sweat on them.  No, not sweat.  I think it was just...  He's got a nervous flop sweat, always.  He's always bringing this...  He has flop sweat in life.  Oh, yeah.  He's just flop sweating his way through life.  Look at him.  Maybe because in the elevator...  I always bring up the story one time. 
[02:30:30]  I went to the doctor's office.  You don't bring up any stories in an elevator.  That's the point of elevators.  Everyone just shuts their mouths.  They're at your fucking AIM Awards.  Right.  You brought up a story in an elevator once?  Yeah, yeah.  It was what happened when I was a doctor, right?  We were on the fourth floor.  Yeah.  And what happened, like, oh, people just get jamming into the elevator, right?  All of a sudden, we see this little, on the red numbers, it says Max Lode, Max Lode.  And we hear the ding, ding, ding, ding.  Max came in.  And what happened, all of a sudden, that thing starts going for... 
[02:31:00]  Max Lode.  Yes.  I have him booked on the show.  Oscar, go ahead.  Oh, okay.  Max Lode.  So, yeah.  Dating red lights.  What happened?  It's going to be a name on Twitter and fucking everywhere else.  Max Lode.  I'm Max Lode.  God, I want that name.  Jesus.  Why does this guy have to go home?  I know.  Friday.  Go ahead.  What?  Max Lode?  Um, I was...  Lights.  The lights, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  So, elevator, it was just going for, like, the ground floor, and it was just...  And then we started hearing this screeching, like, brakes.  And all of a sudden...  Never do that again.  Yeah, and then you know what I said?  What?  Okay.  Hopefully, I'll get off.  And I don't understand what's going on.  The elevator started plummeting because of the Max...  Absolutely, yeah, yeah.  And all of a sudden, and I said to the people on the elevator, I don't think that's a good  sign.  That's what I said to them.  And then, you know, everybody just kept quiet.  And then, finally, when they hit the first floor, it was about, like, a foot off from,  like, what the ledge was, so it wasn't, like, leveled out. 
[02:32:00]  So we almost died in that elevator that day.  What floor were you on when you started falling?  Fourth floor.  Nothing happened if you were on the fourth floor.  You might have spilled your coffee.  You might get a little bounce.  That's it.  That's what happened.  Yeah, exactly.  Spilled coffee.  Yeah, no, I have lots of those.  It's just...  Yeah, anyways.  Wow.  What were we talking about?  Where'd you get that story from anticlimactic.com?  I thought it was, like, the 80th floor.  Yeah, no kidding.  It was the fourth floor.  Who cares?  And too many people got on.  So what?  The elevator just decides it has to go down to the ground floor. 
[02:32:30]  Max load.  Max load.  Max load, yeah.  Max load.  And you didn't almost die.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing happened.  Yeah, nothing happened.  How'd you get off the elevator?  Oh, yeah, no, I just...  Did you have to step up while that stage?  The firemen have to get you?  No, no, no.  Just, you know, step up like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it just raised my...  Yeah, that's it.  Cool.  But she could work that in the 13 episodes.  We got to show it.  It's just like being in the towers after the plane.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can relate to everybody, obviously, because you've almost lost your life.  Anything? 
[02:33:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Why are you just staring at Greg Oreo?  What was the question?  I'm sorry, I missed that.  What was the question?  It's in a microphone.  I am talking to a microphone.  Ground Zero Mosque.  Why don't you want it built?  Oh, no.  It's not me personally.  I'm just saying.  It's just stuff.  What do you mean?  Not you personally?  You want it?  No, no.  I'm just saying.  Like a Muslim?  No, it's just...  All right, so get out.  You're at a courthouse, okay?  What?  Did your Jews walk into the courthouse?  At a courthouse, yeah.  No, if I see one of my fellow paisanos at a courthouse, and, you know, clearly he fucked 
[02:33:30]  up, I'm going to be like, yo, get your shit together, man.  You're making me look bad, because, you know, we're from the same culture, right?  Yeah.  So, like, me, if I was Muslim, I'd be like, you know what?  I don't think that's appropriate.  I mean, that's just...  I would say to somebody, you know, for the bad Muslims, you know, the extremists are making  the good ones look bad.  So, yeah, so that's what I feel on that.  Anyways.  Does that clear up, clarify my point?  No.  No, I know.  I have no clue what you're talking about.  I know, I know.  Yeah, that's what...  JD in New York City wants you to say, that's a good one, Fred, and then laugh. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Do you want me to do it?  Do you want me to do it?  Yeah?  Yeah?  No, I just want to read it.  Oh, okay, cool.  Awesome.  All right.  Cool.  Anyways.  He didn't get sarcasm.  Yeah.  I'm too literal sometimes.  Yeah.  That's a good one, Fred, and then laugh.  That's a good one, Fred.  No, no, the regular laugh.  The regular laugh is what...  Oh, he does have it.  I suck at acting.  Wow.  People are right.  Barney Rubble.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's got the Barney Rubble laugh. 
[02:34:30]  What are you thinking right now?  What am I thinking?  Oh, beer.  That's funny.  I was going to grab a beer.  Give me the Opie and Oscar show.  That's fine.  It's beer, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Just thinking of it.  What are you thinking right now?  Yeah.  TGIF Friday's up the street, so I'm going to hit it before I drive home.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like that.  Yeah, the schooners, the big, big, big glass beer.  Oh, this is really good.  Wait, you're going to drink beer at 11 o'clock in the morning?  Oh, that's right.  No, no.  I mean, I'll do it Friday, because it's Friday.  I'll do it Friday.  No, you're going to drink beer at TGIF right after the show today. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, yeah, but I'm going to leave it before 1 o'clock.  And then have a few pops and then drive home?  That's great.  No, it takes forever to get the car in the garage, man.  It takes like two hours.  Oh, so you really are going to drink and drive.  It takes, yeah, I'll be sober by the time you get in my freaking car.  Oh, sure.  Wow.  Oh, okay, well, this weekend, something came up to me.  This weekend, I was down at Wildwood, and what happened?  We didn't ask you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, no, no, this has got to be a good story.  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  Yes, we're in Wildwood. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I just drank and just, like, I was driving people around.  But I didn't notice I was, like, really tipsy, so.  Yeah.  That's your story?  Yeah, yeah, that was it.  So you were in Wildwood drunk driving.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That made your elevator story look like a Jason Statham movie.  What are you thinking right now?  Oh, right now, right now, Google Maps.  I just, uh.  What?  What's in his head?  Why are you thinking Google Maps?  No, no, I have to look for an address on the way back home. 
[02:36:00]  I have to go pick some stuff up, so, yeah, yeah.  What do you have to pick up?  No, it's plumbing supplies, because I have, like, a really bad leak in my, uh.  Yeah, so I was doing that last night.  Man, this Google is a two-part Poxy.  That thing smells so awful, man.  What does it smell like?  Oh, it's, um.  Oh, man.  I don't know, like puke and, like, and, um, and, and carrots.  I don't know, something like that.  It's just horrible.  Puking carrots.  I just can't think of it.  Anyways, it's hard to compare.  It's just horrible.  Maybe, like, diarrhea.  Yeah, diarrhea is better. 
[02:36:30]  Anyway.  What are you doing?  You were fixing a leak last night?  Yeah, no, it was the pipe.  It's one of the pipes.  This is interesting to a radio show.  Why?  I don't know why I started talking about that.  Fixing a pipe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And I got the glue all over, so then I had to get, like, uh, vinegar and rub it all over  my, my, my hand to get the smell off.  Oh, vinegar.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Not the.  Anyways, yeah.  Uh, yeah.  What are we talking about? 
[02:37:00]  Uh, the mosque.  Oh, oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  So, um.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Freedom of religion.  So, is that really going down?  I mean, it really.  Nobody answered.  Nope.  You really shouldn't say, is that really going down when you're talking about ground zero?  That's humiliating yourself.  Yeah.  That's sensitive to a lot of people.  Yeah.  What are you thinking right now?  Uh, the.  Thinking I could use some more cans of that parted me.  Oh, yeah.  Right now.  No.  I kind of went blank right now.  It's just, uh.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm just trying to reorganize the thoughts, you know.  I'm seeing. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  I mean, hopefully, like, people don't hate me because of what I'm saying right now.  I mean, I don't.  No, they don't hate you.  What do you think of the eggs?  The eggs?  Yeah.  We're not allowed to eat eggs for a while.  That's true.  Oh, yeah.  That's sad.  I mean, uh.  It's hard.  Well.  Hmm.  I don't know.  You guys ever been in an egg farm?  Like, you know, with chickens and.  Yeah.  It's all the smell there.  It just stinks.  I mean, it's just.  You've been to an egg farm?  Smells like vomit.  Yeah, no.  Smells like puking carrots.  Why have you been to an egg farm?  No, no.  I grew up on a farm down in Colombia.  Yeah, I did. 
[02:38:00]  So, yeah.  What kind of farm?  Oh, it was.  Coca.  Coca leaves.  No kidding.  You don't show up, brothers.  Yeah.  It was cattle in.  What part of Colombia?  Kimbaja.  Armenia.  Did you know Pablo Escobar?  I might have seen him a couple soccer games, maybe.  He was a huge soccer fan.  I was seven at the time, though, when he was into the sports.  You ever mule coke?  Huh?  You ever mule coke up your ass?  A little soft Colombian bottom? 
[02:38:30]  No, no, no, no.  That looks like difficult time.  Yeah.  I mean, I've seen a few films on that.  And, yeah, I mean, these poor girls, I mean, just.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, for 5,000 bucks, I wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't risk it.  Nah.  No, no, no.  Yeah, Jordan's suggesting that Puking Carrots would be a great show for Nickelodeon.  You guys watch iCarly?  No.  You guys watch iCarly or no?  No.  Carly?  I think that's a morning radio show.  Oh, okay.  Puking Carrots. 
[02:39:00]  Puking Carrots in the morning.  iCarly, why do you watch that?  Oh, no, it's funny.  Are you a pedophile?  It's funny.  Yeah, it's funny.  Show me.  Okay, he said, yeah.  You're a pedophile, really?  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no.  I said, are you a pedophile?  Oh, you want to see iCarly.  The kid Spencer on the show?  She's not as hot as Selena Gomez.  Selena Gomez.  Goddamn computer.  The Witches of Waverly Place, whatever it's called.  Oh, I like the iCarly girls.  You like the iCarly girls?  Really?  Which one do you like, Oscar?  Let's see.  I forgot the...  You like the blonde or the brunette? 
[02:39:30]  Sam, I guess it's her blonde girl.  I like her better.  Really?  You want to have sex with Sam, huh?  Oh, well, if she...  After she's 18, it's...  Sam Roberts?  I'm just kidding.  There's no chance in hell.  Sam Roberts?  Sam Roberts?  Sam Roberts?  No, no, no.  Sam from Quincy?  Why are you putting your hands in your pocket?  No, I'm just trying to keep my hands in control.  I mean, I'm just trying to remember the stuff I learned in public speaking class.  Why, you want to hit Jimmy?  Yeah, just don't work.  No, I want to...  I know you don't like him, but don't hit him.  No, I want to hit Jimmy.  What?  Hit that up.  Wait, what? 
[02:40:00]  No, it's Miranda Kerr.  Oh, that's...  God.  She's...  Goddamn, that fucking asshole.  Miranda Kerr.  Why?  Who's that?  Miranda Kerr.  You like her or don't her?  She's so hot.  Oh, her actual physical asshole.  Yes.  Do you like her asshole, Oscar?  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  All right.  What else is going on in your head?  Right now...  Oh, no.  I have to fix a bunch of stuff for school, so on the way home, I have to stop by school  and fix a bunch of... 
[02:40:30]  Oh, that's good.  So you're going to have a few beers, get in your car, and then drive to school.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  You truly are a boob.  Yeah.  I just do that a lot when I was a sophomore in high school.  I just go to the bathrooms and just pound them down, and then just go back to class.  What?  Where did you get your beers in class?  Oh, no, no.  Before.  No, before school.  You know, I used to get a little pint of Jameson, and then just go to the bathroom, and then...  Are you an alcoholic?  Yeah, I think so.  How old are you?  No, but I'm pretty controlled, though.  I'm 26. 
[02:41:00]  No, but see, I still work.  Jimmy, you like people that say they're controlled alcoholics?  So you're functioning.  Yeah, functioning.  Functioning alcoholics?  Sure.  Yeah, I mean...  Actually, yeah.  The doctor used to do this test on me, and it was like asking all these questions, and  yeah, he deducted.  I had a drinking problem, but I told him, you know what?  It's something I do really good at.  I'm good at, you know what I'm doing, to drinking.  How did he decide you had a drinking problem?  Oh, because he's asking me a question if I ever wanted to drink a beer before 10 o'clock  in the morning.  And I said, yeah, it's prom weekend, I said to him, and then he was like, oh, okay. 
[02:41:30]  And then I scored like a 14 out of like, I don't know, like 15 or something.  So yeah.  What was the one?  Are you drinking right now?  Are you Irish?  You're a raging alcoholic.  No, no, I don't rage, but I'm not violent.  I'm a hyper-alcoholic.  No, raging means just to drink a lot.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actual rage.  Just a way to describe how many beers you have.  How many beers did you have last night?  Last night, zero.  No, but I do have jungle juice, though.  I should have had some of that. 
[02:42:00]  Jungle juice?  What's jungle juice?  I thought it was Hitler's DNA.  Oh, wow.  That's easy.  I'm going to get funnier than that today.  A little callback from the beginning of the show.  Look up Black Hitler.  What's jungle juice?  What is jungle juice?  Oh, it's like a mixture of different grains, spirits.  It has vodka, Everclear, and you put some Kool-Aid or some maybe fruit punch, and then they 
[02:42:30]  put those apples and oranges.  Where'd you learn that?  Prison?  What the fuck?  Yeah, it sounds like...  You should iron a grilled cheese sandwich.  It sounds like shitty sangria.  Yeah, exactly, but it's potent, though, because you don't feel...  It's not perfect for, like, the girls.  You don't invite them over, and, hey, hey, or...  Yeah, then rape them.  Yeah.  Are you a date rapist?  You are, right?  No, no, no, no.  What girls are fucking going to drink jungle juice?  No, but it's good, because it tastes like fruit punch.  It's sweet.  You don't taste the alcohol.  So it's good.  It's just the perfect weapon. 
[02:43:00]  This guy loves alcohol.  Oh, he loves it.  What are you thinking right now?  Oh, no, I just saw a commercial.  A Camaro's pretty badass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love that.  What are you thinking about?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, you're multitasking.  Yeah.  Why do you think the Camaro's a badass car?  Oh, no, it's really...  Oh, it's just so awesome.  It's like the...  Yeah, because it's not like the Mustang, because everybody thinks...  Like, you see muscle cars, oh, it's a Mustang.  It's like, no, no, it's a Camaro.  Uh-oh.  That's what I always do.  No, and then...  You don't like Anthony's Mustang?  No, I love Mustangs. 
[02:43:30]  Don't get me wrong.  But it's just something a little different.  Until, you know, just...  No, there's nothing wrong with Mustangs.  What's different?  What?  Oh, Mustangs are a dime a dozen?  Like fucking...  No, but...  Shelby Mustangs are a dime a dozen?  Yeah, I think they build too many.  That's the thing.  Oh, that's awesome.  Oh, shit.  You like that?  Yeah.  No, but then there's also the...  Yeah, like the special editions.  I mean, yeah, the 500s.  Let's be honest.  There are a lot of Mustangs all over the place.  Jesus Christ.  Enough with the fucking Mustangs.  Hey, did you say that iCarly's a funny show?  Yeah, I like it. 
[02:44:00]  Because someone on Twitter's saying,  my seven-year-old thinks it's a funny show.  Oh.  Why is it a funny show?  Well, I like Spencer, the little goofy kid.  You know, the iCarly's brother.  You like one of the kids on iCarly?  He's so funny.  He's funny.  Why is he funny?  What little kids do you like?  What did he do that was funny on iCarly?  He's going to make a funny face  when he has a finger in his ass?  It's probably just...  Because he's a kid like random  and maybe I can relate to the guy?  I would watch it.  Oh, you can relate to a little kid. 
[02:44:30]  Just to jerk off.  He watches to laugh at.  Because he can relate to the little kid.  Let me see some more iCarly pictures.  I want to see if I could spank.  She is kind of cute.  What's wrong with you?  She's kind of cute.  What are you going to say?  Nah, not really.  Nah, a little bit.  You guys like Rosario Dawson?  No.  No?  Why are you asking that?  No, I just...  Yeah, I don't like her.  Yeah.  I just...  Well, I'd bring it up.  Oh, okay.  All right.  She's black?  No, no.  It's because, I mean, 
[02:45:00]  there's a similarity maybe in her face.  The pain all of them?  Stop being such a fucking race-hater, man.  No, I'm not...  I've seen Lazy Town, Denver Pest.  I've seen the little girl  with the fucking pink hair from Lazy Town.  Oh, yeah.  We talked about Lazy Town.  Of course.  And they put her in all the provocative little poses.  There's a video of her that makes it look like  she's having sex with a black man or something.  What?  I don't know.  Damn.  That's not hard.  Are they from Lazy Town?  That's photoshopped.  Yeah, they're from Lazy Town.  Damn it. 
[02:45:30]  Lazy Town.  Yeah, that's great.  Good.  Those are old shows, though.  She's old now.  Yeah.  Not old, but older.  Of age.  You're a little calmer now.  This is good.  Yeah, what's going on?  Yeah, no, I was just entertained by the pictures.  You're among friends, Oscar.  Oh, thank you.  You like Lazy Town?  Thank you.  No, I'm not familiar with the show.  Oh.  What are you thinking now?  Right now, what's Lazy Town?  That's what I'm thinking.  Oh, really?  I'm just trying to figure it out.  Dig it up and see maybe if I recall something. 
[02:46:00]  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you don't like Asians?  Yeah, we learned a lot today.  No, I don't like Asians.  What?  Yeah, you're racist?  Yeah.  No, no.  You don't like chinks or spokes?  Just say it, Oscar.  You're a horrible man.  These are people just trying to assimilate and have a nice life.  You know, you hate their guts.  No, you know what I hate when I go...  Oscar, I'm sorry.  Whisper so they don't hear you out there.  Okay, okay.  Oh, God.  No, no, what I hate is like, oh, my God.  What the fuck is this?  That's Lazy Town.  They've done more videos using that Lazy Town girl and putting her into, like, horrible videos. 
[02:46:30]  I didn't even know that this was going on out there.  Yeah.  It looks like she's having sex.  Yeah.  She's against the wall, and they looped it.  They looped her eyes.  It looks like she's absolutely getting fucked.  Yes.  Bedbugs, Oscar?  That's what they want.  Oh, yeah.  Good to know about.  Come on.  Deep Sea in New York City.  Because he's a New Yorker, and supposedly it's all over the place, this bedbug thing.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  He wants to get rid of him.  I have the perfect solution.  No, he wants to raise them and sell them as pets.  How do you get rid of a bedbug?  You have to take out the mattress, and also you have to get outside. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, but shit, it doesn't work.  No.  No, you have to put gasoline on it.  Go with your original idea.  Yeah.  No, because I mean.  You put the mattress outside, then what?  No, some bed, I mean, some beds actually do have, like, the wooden, like, um.  The what?  The wooden.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Wait, yeah.  It's not the metal one.  Yeah, exactly.  Is it metal?  No.  Well, the metal, but it has, like, wooden beans going across the bed.  Wooden.  Beans.  Wooden.  Beans.  Wood.  Okay, wood.  Anyways, you know, a plank's the. 
[02:47:30]  Did you say wooden?  Right.  Are you saying wooden?  No.  And you say it like wooden?  Like, if there was an IQ test, you wouldn't pass it.  Probably give, like, a two.  All right.  Wooden.  So the mattress is outside with a wooden.  Yeah, yeah.  So you grab some gasoline.  Yeah.  And then, I guess you could pour it on the mattress.  I mean, it's just.  No, not on the mattress.  And you're supposed to sleep in the bed after you do this?  No, no.  You have to leave it aside for a couple days until the gasoline smells just like, it just.  Are you insane? 
[02:48:00]  Then you sleep on it.  What the fuck would now sleep on it?  Do you know that gasoline, it doesn't just go away?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess I have to try it out, but I don't have a bug bed problem, so.  Bug bed problem?  You know what I'm saying?  In your wooden bed?  Yeah.  This guy wouldn't.  You know.  So what's the other idea?  What's the other idea?  Because that one's not really going to work.  No, yeah, no.  You can't just pour gasoline on your mattress and hope the smell goes away.  Oh, oh, oh.  I don't know.  What are you thinking right now? 
[02:48:30]  Cock.  Ow.  No, no.  No, I just saw that little commercial about losing weight, and then this really fat girl  was just on the commercial, losing weight, 43 pounds or something.  So just thinking about losing weight.  All right, awesome.  Yeah, nothing interesting.  It's just a little mumble, jumble stuff.  All right.  So you're against the Moss being built?  No, no, but I don't know.  You know what?  It doesn't concern me.  That's what you said?  I don't.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Okay, okay. 
[02:49:00]  That's what I said.  Okay, okay, okay.  Okay, okay.  What did you say?  What did I say?  Yeah, I remember.  He called me an idiot for driving a Mustang.  No, no, I didn't.  He said you were a fucking hot rod car hack.  Yeah.  No, I mean, I haven't seen it personally.  I mean, I'm sure it's pretty.  Yeah, that's good.  Call someone's car pretty.  Pretty.  Exactly.  That's what he wants to hear.  You like the Camaro, though?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a Chevy guy.  I like Chevys.  What do you drive?  Right now, I have a 96 Jeep. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, so you like Chevys, so you drive a Jeep.  No, but that's because I was kind of forced to drive that thing.  That's my car.  Yeah.  Oh, that's badass, though.  No, but you know what I understand is the suspension on it affects the handling, therefore  going around the corner is a little shaky.  My car?  No, not your personally, but I heard on the GTRs.  There's a GTK.  No, that's a GT500.  Yeah.  But is it the 500K, though?  No, it's not the K.  Okay, okay.  All right.  It's 500's fucking, well, you're talking out your ass now. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  It's a good car.  It handles fucking amazing.  Oh, awesome.  Awesome.  Yeah, I never...  Good evening.  I never drove one, personally.  I mean, what's that?  But I just, I read it on Car Trend.  Car Trend?  Oh, the magazine.  What's that?  That's not your point of view.  What are you, Pete Dominic?  Oh.  Anyways, yeah.  So what are we talking about now? 
[02:50:30]  I don't know.  You run the radio show.  Go ahead.  Why are you looking at your phone all of a sudden?  Oh, no.  I'm just checking the time.  I don't know.  It's just a little hot in here.  It's getting a little hot in here.  Yeah, yeah.  A little.  A little.  That's right.  So you guys doing anything fun this weekend?  What, is he interviewing us now?  Exactly.  Well, I'm just...  Why don't you just enjoy the silence for a moment?  Okay.  You don't have to fill up the air with words all the time.  Every second doesn't have to be you talking.  Okay, cool, cool.  Someone talking.  Go ahead. 
[02:51:00]  Press yourself.  That's good.  I don't know what to say now.  We're not saying anything.  Oh, Opal.  Remember?  Yeah, you could just...  I would just...  You could just say nothing.  Okay.  Say nothing?  You want me to say nothing?  No?  Holy shit.  I know.  I'm all right.  Just say nothing.  Okay. 
[02:51:30]  Say nothing?  I don't get it.  I'm confused.  Just say nothing.  I don't get it.  I'm confused.  I'm confused.  Just say nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing?  What?  Just...  Okay.  I was watching Super Troopers the other day.  It was not a funny movie.  You guys like that movie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a funny movie.  Do you actually sleep at night? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  I had a good sleep.  I went to bed at about 10.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I had to...  I woke up at 10 or 2.  Passes out.  Right.  Went to bed.  Yeah.  He sleeps two minutes a night.  Yeah.  He actually has a bag of shit.  On his gasoline bed while he's fucking doing shots.  Smoking.  Why do you...  Why did you bring up Super Troopers?  It's a fine movie, but...  Yeah.  Out of nowhere.  What was that about?  No, I was just killing some time.  It was a couple days ago, and I was like, oh, let's pump that in.  Because I just bought it on Amazon for like $2.  It was used.  So I got a good deal on it. 
[02:52:30]  No, you didn't.  No.  You were bought by a dollar.  Anyways.  Oh, I bought another one for a penny.  It was an IFC original documentary.  It was called The Slasher.  This is a guy, Michael Bennett.  And I think it was directed by...  Oh, it was directed by John Landis from...  The guy did the Thriller.  That's a fine documentary.  It's about this guy who goes around...  Slashing people.  No.  Well, he slashes prices on cars.  So he goes to dealerships, and he goes, you know, I can sell you 50 cars in a weekend. 
[02:53:00]  And then he just does this, develops this elaborate plan, and advertises and tells people  he's selling an $88 car.  Yeah, I know.  Who was that going to produce that?  Maybe because the guy drinks a lot, and when he's on the job, so maybe I've got Michael  Bennett, the guy.  So maybe I can relate to the guy.  I mean, I've done that before at work.  People, don't worry.  He's gone Friday.  Yeah.  Oh, thank God.  Are they enjoying this segment? 
[02:53:30]  No.  Yeah.  It was fun.  It was fun.  It was fun.  No, they're just saying he's exhausting to listen to.  Yeah.  You exhaust a lot of people out there.  They're actually calling you too chatty for radio.  You know how chatty you have to be to be too chatty for radio?  Wow, yes.  Thank you, Rat Spit.  Vegas.  You like the Vegas?  Oh, absolutely.  I was there last year.  Yeah?  Yeah, July.  It was fun.  It was a fun experience.  Where did you stay?  I stayed at the Planet Hollywood.  Yeah, it was fun.  It was right after the month when they had the hangover. 
[02:54:00]  So they had the guys there for the crew.  Not the crew.  The actors.  And then, yeah, so they were replaying with Mike Tyson, doing an interview for E!  E!  True Hollywood.  E!  Entertainment tonight.  Anyways, what the?  Anyway, so I was, yeah, we went to Las Vegas.  That's, yeah.  That's cool.  I wanted to try out a hooker right there, because they kept giving out little cards for  us.  Hey, can you call up?  It'll be an awful bait and switch, Oscar.  I'm glad you didn't.  Oh, wow.  You should have asked Jimmy.  Jimmy knows from experience. 
[02:54:30]  It's the business card.  Yeah.  The bait and switch.  The girl on the card will show up.  Sure she will.  No.  No, they never show up.  No.  And what are you getting instead?  Anybody not on the card, you have the rest of the planet to choose from, but that girl  won't be coming.  Willie Hitler's wife.  Or Willie Hitler.  I'd rather have Willie Hitler.  Jesus, that wife was a pig.  Oscar, you like hookers?  Gleason.  Right to the gas chamber, Norton. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, you're going.  You're going.  Bang, Jews.  You like the hookers, Oscar?  Well, not the ones I've seen.  No.  No, no, no.  I don't even bother.  I mean, it's just ugly.  And the one time I was walking, the one came up to me and said, hey, I'll give you a bullet  over five bucks.  And I said, no, thanks.  Hey.  I needed five dollars. 
[02:55:30]  I was being courteous.  Never asked.  Yeah.  That's kind of like a hard position.  I mean, like a profession to do.  It's just, you know, just having sex for a living with random people.  I mean, I like I have a friend.  He's like an addict.  Prostitute.  I mean, that's what he does.  You have a co-worker who's like that.  Check that picture out.  What's his name?  No, check that one out.  Nice.  Who's that?  Would she show up, Jimmy?  It depends.  It's Craigslist, I'm guessing.  So I don't know, man.  I've had such a Russian Mitch mixed. 
[02:56:00]  Probably not.  No, it's it's it's hard to say, man.  I've had such mixed luck in my life, you know, with my stuff.  Yeah.  All right, Oscar.  Yeah.  You know, in Florida, they have like.  I didn't ask.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  What do they got in Florida?  What's that in Florida?  You know, those classified like free newspapers you get like in the corners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, at the back, they have the classified ads. 
[02:56:30]  And then it's just actually girls and prostitutes that, you know, are providing the service.  So then.  Oh, actually, I reminded me.  I don't know.  Anyways, what happened?  I was with my friend Alejandro.  Right.  And we were staying at his apartment.  Right.  And some bitch with a big camera thing to him.  Alejandro.  Alejandro.  So what happened is his neighbor is actually a transvesti.  And then and then so then we went out and we stole the stop sign.  And we were talking to a neighbor and all of a sudden she can hold it up right now. 
[02:57:00]  So she or he or she, she, he or whatever.  She.  OK.  She had like one of those belly shirts, but her boobs were like so saggy and shit like that.  I know something went wrong with surgery.  And then she lets, she rips a fart.  She just farts out of nowhere.  And all we hear was.  That's what we heard.  So that's the transvestite story.  I was going to tell you.  Anyways.  Why would you.  Yeah.  Why would you imitate the sound the fart made? 
[02:57:30]  No, no.  Because it was, I guess it was.  She was loose or whatever.  Man, did you blow him?  No, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  No sex.  You did?  No, no, no.  No, no.  Absolutely not.  Did you hold his cock in your mouth and like not suck, but just hum?  That's not gay.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Look at.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I'm gay.  You guys seen that movie Transamerica?  No?  I have not.  No.  OK.  Well, it takes place with that.  This guy becomes a girl.  And then.  You into that?  No, no.  It was just an interesting movie. 
[02:58:00]  You like to lift up a dress and see a fucking unclipped gift, as we call it?  Oh.  No, I'm not.  No.  I'm wrong.  I'm wrong.  And what I would like.  A transcript of this.  Not a transcript, but Oscar's been on.  A memory wipe.  A memory wipe would be good.  I want a list of everything he talked about.  It has to be a hundred things.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Damn.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, you really do cover a lot of ground.  Sure.  And yet you cover no ground. 
[02:58:30]  Exactly.  It's an amazing combination.  What are you thinking right now?  No, job interviews.  Because I do the same thing when I go to a job interview.  You know how they let you have any questions and I just go on?  You know?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's tough job interviews.  Yeah.  I'm sure somebody's going to find this later down years.  They're going to be when I'm applying for a job and then, you know, just this will pop  up and be like, whoa.  Pop up.  It's a pop up.  Pop up.  It's a pop up.  Pop up.  Yeah, this might pop up.  Pop up.  But even if this does pop up. 
[02:59:00]  If it does pop up, you can always.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a guy, Ray, in Old Bridge, New Jersey.  He goes, this guy's making me so nuts that I downloaded the ONA app for Android just to  tell him to shut the fuck up.  Oh, wow.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, wow.  They're calling you boring, Oscar.  Yeah, no.  I don't think you're boring.  No, no.  Hey, whoever.  They want to go grab a beer.  I mean, I'm not boring when I'm.  Where are you going to be?  Maybe have beers with some people.  Yeah, absolutely.  Where are you going to be?  That's right.  I'll be up the street at DJI Fridays.  Where's that?  Oh, I don't know.  It's like 51st on 7th. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, something like that.  Damn.  Look at that.  No worries.  I was at a party a couple weekends ago.  He didn't ask you.  He just comes out with these stories.  I'm really trying to end this, but it's just amazing.  All right.  Well, now we got to ask you, what's up with the party?  Yeah, no.  So I was hitting a couple girls there, right?  Yeah.  And in the one, she was like, what do you call it?  She was like the quiet type.  I was like, you know what?  I was like an easy girl to talk to.  And I got her phone number, right?  And then, so I asked her, hey, what are you doing Saturday night? 
[03:00:00]  You know, let's do something.  Did she say washing her hair?  Anyways.  She was on chemo at the time.  What are you doing?  Crying and pulling my hair out of the drain while I massage my underarm lump.  What are you doing besides drinking?  So what are you doing?  Ah, thinking of what could have been as I lay in the bed on my side and shit.  Oh, somebody massages my skinny legs.  What the fuck? 
[03:00:30]  What are you doing Saturday night?  Ah, just writing a few things down for any surviving members of my family to think of.  Yeah.  What are you doing Saturday night?  Ah, trying on a wig.  Trying on a wig.  Or what am I doing?  Sneezing and getting hair all over my shoulders.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, Oscar.  So what happened?  Oh, he's doing the old nipple tweak.  What happened with the fucking party and the chick?  Exactly.  What is she doing Saturday night?  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  No, no.  It was just, I called her up Sunday.  She just played off like, no, I'm busy putting my uncle's all day.  And I was like, what's already one o'clock?  That's what you do on a Sunday.  You visit, like, the family.  Oh, okay.  You should have called her on Saturday.  She had a bedpan changed.  This is a fantastic video, by the way.  No, I...  It's so odd to just see something with tits jerking off.  That's bizarre.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, what a...  Look at that.  What a creepy load that was.  It dribbled out like a...  Her dick had a stroke. 
[03:01:30]  Fuck it.  She's there tugging on Edmund Musky.  Jesus.  Edmund Musky.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  That's not only a dick.  That's a Dick Clark she's tugging on.  Oscar, your girl party story went nowhere.  Yeah, no, I just...  I probably forgot a couple of details in there.  Holy shit.  What are you doing Saturday night?  Oh, just moaning weakly while my family hates the burden that I've become. 
[03:02:00]  What are you doing?  Sipping soup.  Petting any animal that isn't disgusted by the smell of sickness coming off me.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Holy shit.  Holy fuck.  So what are you doing Saturday?  Ah, throwing up into a bucket.  Why?  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  So what did she say? 
[03:02:30]  Exactly.  What did old Lumpy Pitts say she was doing?  I don't know.  Oh, no, just...  What are you doing?  Rubbing vitamin E oil on these scars?  Oh, fuck.  Are we done with Oscar?  I thought you had a date.  I didn't even hear the end of the story.  Exactly.  What happened?  What are you doing?  You got a girl's number and she...  Cancer chick.  Yeah, no, it was her uncle's house.  They didn't have cancer.  Oh, I went to her uncle's house.  Yeah, that's it.  I didn't...  I just think...  You know? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  She comes over, we do puzzles.  And I finger her.  They're calling you out on your elevator story.  Oh, shit.  Elevator operator.  Russell in Houston.  Oh, God, he answers phones on the elevator.  Hurry up.  Oh, operator.  Oh, can you...  I'll get her.  Are you talking?  Why would anybody joke around with you?  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to have a joke while you were talking.  Go ahead, elevator operator.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You talk.  Seven, please.  Sorry.  Didn't mean to try to joke around and have fun. 
[03:03:30]  Five, please.  Holy shit.  Why are you lying about me, please?  See how that hurts?  All right, go ahead.  This guy's saying you're lying.  Shit head.  And your elevator didn't plummet.  What's up?  What do you have to prove?  I mean, come on, let me hear it.  I mean, you're not professional.  You said you could hear the ropes like zinging down and go all the way to the first floor.  No, I said brakes.  The brakes.  You ever hear brakes on the car?  He's saying squeaky?  That means the governor, sir.  Dude, if elevators...  If they lose control, they go up. 
[03:04:00]  They don't go down.  It's impossible.  Well, according to gravity, if you're on the fourth floor, it's going to go down.  Fuck, that's good to fucking know.  Not when you have a counterweight system on the elevator.  And it's called a governor, a thing that grabs the side.  Well, I didn't check if they had a counterbalance system or anything.  That's why when I ride an elevator, I don't check for that.  What, were you at the Coliseum?  No, I was at a doctor's office.  It was just a four-story building.  Oh, he took the girl.  She had to go and get more bad news. 
[03:04:30]  What are you doing Saturday?  Hey, telling people where it's spread to.  Oh, this fucking guy.  He just has to get his elevator info out.  Jesus, enough about the elevator.  All right, Russell.  How many fucking little groups have you cleared at parties with your stories?  You want to get his info out there.  Yeah, it's got its ups and downs.  You'll clink and walk away.  Oh, God.  I'm in the anal elevator business.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, working my way up to the top.  Right back down the bottom again.  I saw a little stool.  People just walk away from him.  How many times, sir, have you seen the backs of heads and collars before your story was finished? 
[03:05:00]  How many times have you had somebody's eye contact and then said elevator and three seconds later been staring at the back of their hat as they moonwalked away from you?  That girl doesn't even have cancer.  She's trying to get cancer to avoid hearing your elevator stories.  If they're moonwalking, they would see the front of him.  No, because they moonwalk to the front. 
[03:05:30]  That would be walking.  Yeah, they moonwalk.  I'm confused there.  No, I mean, literally, they get into his ship.  That's why Neil Armstrong did what he did, was to get away from that cunt and his elevator stories.  Holy shit.  I'm fucking dizzy from laughing.  Oscar, what are you thinking right now?  I don't know what to think, really.  Oh, that's good.  We finally got to the end of this.  If you're not thinking, any more stories?  Oh, no, nothing of interest.  What happened over the weekend besides the girl? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, I went down to Wildwood with the family, so I just pretty much, I drove them on there.  What happened in Wildwood?  It was just because I have a 60-year-old sister, so then I guess...  You have a 60-year-old sister?  Oh, I know, huh?  Sixth face.  Yeah.  I always say, tell me when Oscar's coming home.  Yeah, it was just fun.  We went dolphin watching, though.  That was fun.  That's good in Wildwood.  Yeah, yeah.  Where'd you see dolphins in Wildwood? 
[03:06:30]  You didn't see any, did you?  No, no, we took the little silver bullet thing.  You can go any fucking watching.  It doesn't mean you're going to see anything.  No, no, we still don't.  I once stood on 38th Street and went fucking hat watching.  Ronnie, you should get out of the subway and go fucking headlight watching.  Could someone please get together a fuckload of references Jimmy makes to hats?  Has anyone done that?  Not yet.  Yeah, we sort of did. 
[03:07:00]  If D-Boy could just get every reference to hats.  I think we have a piece that we did a while ago.  It's an older piece, but we could answer.  Holy shit.  We'll do that into commercials if we haven't.  It's always about hats.  Yeah.  Oscar Dolphin watching.  Yeah, yeah.  So that's what it did.  But it sucked, though, because I had a couple friends that were going to, well, we're going  to go down there and hang out, and then nobody showed up, so I just ended up being me and  my folks.  They're not your friends.  They're people who hate you and told you the wrong place to go.  Yeah.  They were in Atlantic City.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, Atlantic City.  Exactly.  Atlantic City, yeah.  Ever been there?  Yeah, yeah, a couple times.  Where do you stay?  Yeah.  No, I didn't stay.  I just go there to gamble for a night and come back.  Where do you take the bus?  No, I usually drive drunk back from Alaska.  I saw Shakira there a couple years ago.  That was fun.  That was a fun show.  It was Wyclef.  Yeah.  It was a good show.  It was a thing.  What was the name of the tour?  I don't remember.  But it was a fun time, though.  It sucked because I was in the middle of the seats, so every time I needed to go to the 
[03:08:00]  bathroom and get a beer, I had to like, excuse me, excuse me.  And then he just put my ass on.  Like, everybody's like...  That didn't stop you from drinking.  No, hell no.  I got pretty...  Good boy.  Yeah, that's right.  Wow, his stories all start out like they're going to be the greatest story every year.  I was in Atlantic City and we're gambling and drinking.  Wow, I got to hear what happened.  I went home.  And then it just fucking dies out.  His stories die on the vine like nothing else I've ever seen or heard.  Right.  It's just...  You have no endings.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  I'm aware of that. 
[03:08:30]  Well, no, you do have an ending.  Your last day's Friday.  Yeah.  So what happened?  We were staying there and the presidential motorcade was coming and there was a man running.  And then what happened?  Ah, my phone rang and the boss said that the shipment was going to be late.  So I turned away and went into the building.  No, no.  I heard a bang or something.  It was...  But then...  What was I saying?  That's how you sound, dude.  Yeah, I know.  I have to work on that. 
[03:09:00]  I have to work on that.  Yeah.  Wooden.  Wooden.  Wooden.  Wooden.  Wooden.  The wooden bed.  The wooden bed.  Would it be occupied?  No, it wouldn't.  Somebody with a vagina.  Oh, vagina.  Once I saw the picture of one and then I put down the magazine and ate breakfast.  Is that what happened?  I don't remember.  You had a girlfriend?  No, no.  I'm single.  When's the last time you fucked a girl?  Fuck.  You guys really want to know?  No, forget it. 
[03:09:30]  Of course I want to know.  We want to know all that other horse shit, but no.  Tell the elevator story again.  Right.  How you plummeted from four to one.  Right.  Thank God you made it.  Do you understand?  If you were underneath the elevator, you would have lived.  All right.  When was the last time?  I think it was like last October.  Yeah, last October.  Yeah, I just had a girl come over to the house and then we just ate pizza and had sex.  Who was she?  Huh?  That's a classy girl.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Who is she?  Oh, she's a friend.  Friend.  Have you seen her since? 
[03:10:00]  Oh, no.  No, not really.  That was her name, Pizza.  No, it was a guy named Pizza.  Get it?  You suck dick.  No.  You ate pizza.  That's right.  No, no.  Pepperoni and cheese all over his cock.  I think she was a hooker because you said that she came over last October, a friend of  yours, you had pizza and had sex and you haven't seen her since.  Yeah, that's right.  Hooker?  No, no, no.  No, no.  How bad of a lay are you?  He promised a girl dinner.  He bought a pizza. 
[03:10:30]  That is pretty cheap.  Why haven't you seen her since?  No, it's just one of those things in the moment and, you know, just...  What, did you call her?  It was like a rainy Saturday night.  It was nothing to do.  Did you ever call her again?  Oh, yeah.  And what'd she say?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Just...  Nothing?  You were just going, hello, hello?  Yeah, she wouldn't acknowledge or beep once for yes.  She's probably being murdered in her house under the bed, just dummies babbling.  Oh, somebody's broken into her.  Oh, I witnessed a murder once.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was outside and I saw someone get out of the car and a man with a knife, but then 
[03:11:00]  my cab came.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys thought I had any Halloween costume ideas for this year?  What?  Yes.  Fuck it all.  Why don't you dress up as somebody interesting?  Do you have a Halloween costume?  No, I'm thinking about it.  I'm thinking...  Yeah?  What are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  Yeah.  That's good.  I think I want to be Alan from The Hangover.  You know what?  That wasn't that big a thing where people will know who you are. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, okay.  How would you dress, like, for that?  No, I just get...  I saw a t-shirt online.  It had the little baby strap at the front.  You know, baby caros.  Yeah.  You know what you want to do?  Put a shirt with a bunch of Z's on it and go, it's Oscar from the radio show.  Shit.  Halloween costumes.  No.  We haven't thought of that.  Nah.  Didn't give it any thought.  No.  But you apparently have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Maybe a race car driver or something.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah?  How would you dress for that?  Oh, no.  Go get, like, a full...  Like, you know, NASCAR guys with the boots.  It's cool, though, because, like, in October, it's practical, because it's kind of cold.  In October?  No.  October?  When?  No, you're right.  You're right, actually.  October.  It's cold.  It's cold.  For Halloween, yeah.  Cool.  No.  What month are you talking about now, though?  October.  For Halloween?  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  Nothing.  October?  October. 
[03:12:30]  October.  October, yeah.  October.  October's right.  October.  Yeah.  October.  Take a B and make it a B.  No one's business.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  I see, I see, I see.  Sorry.  Yeah, you're a vooove.  Yeah.  October.  October.  Yeah.  October.  October.  Anyways, but, you know, they also have, what do you call it, Octoberfest for the beer?  You know, with the local shop in my house.  Yeah, we're just going to be drinking, like, 25 ounces and shit.  That's funny.  I mean, just, cool. 
[03:13:00]  It's getting like I'm in a loop.  I love this guy.  I love him, too.  Oh, my God.  We're going to miss you, Oscar.  Oh, thank you.  I'm trying to figure out how to keep you around for this nonsense.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, oh, yes?  You think we should take a break, Oscar?  You felt the energy leave the room, right?  No, I'm just saying.  Why do you think we should take a break, Oscar?  Oh, I don't know.  I know.  It's a good time.  Good time.  You know, just.  It's a good time. 
[03:13:30]  That was a show.  The 70s.  Good time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no.  Okay.  If you guys don't want a break, it's okay.  I mean, that's fine.  I was just making a suggestion.  That's all.  Once I was on an escalator and it stopped.  And I was stuck there for hours.  It was like the traffic jam in China.  Did you hear that guffaw?  Yeah.  That was funny.  I stood there.  The fire department brought a ladder so I could get down. 
[03:14:00]  But then I realized it was just stairs.  And I felt stupid.  And I went home.  Yeah.  And drank.  Till I passed out.  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  I don't pass out anymore.  Anymore.  I gave a girl pizza and had sex with her so hard that her wig fell off the side of the  hospital bed.  Jesus.  I just fucking laughed, man.  It rules.  Is it okay if you take a break, Oscar? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, that's fine.  Sure.  Do you mind if I plug my gig?  Don't go right ahead.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You, yeah.  No, I'm just checking.  Why don't you let him do it, Jimmy?  He's okay.  He's great at it.  He's for my show.  It's true.  Gotta plug that gig.  Catch Jimmy at Boneyard at 11 a.m.  Is that?  No.  Is that?  Yeah.  What?  No.  The show is called Jim Norton Obsessed on the Boneyard.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.  Catch Jimmy at the Boneyard.  Yeah, look at the club.  It's the graveyard, actually.  What do you think?  That's a bar?  Oh.  Well, it didn't have the, it's called Catch Jimmy. 
[03:15:00]  Go ahead.  You heard him.  Oh, okay.  Oh, what?  You repeat it again?  No, no, no, no.  No repeating.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just promote Jimmy.  Okay, so Catch Jimmy Show at the Boneyard at 11 a.m.  I know I missed something out, right?  It's Jim Norton Obsessed on the Boneyard at 11 o'clock.  Why are you writing it when you can just say it?  Oh, my God.  He's writing it down.  Oh, my dear sweet Lord.  Were you ever in a movie where you tattooed yourself to remember things?  Did that just happen? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy told him what he needs to say, so he decided to write it down so he doesn't forget when he goes back on microphone.  Why didn't you just say it?  No, I have really bad short-term memory.  Are you dyslexic?  Yeah.  All right, check it out.  So, he had Jim Norton Obsessed on the Boneyard at 11 a.m.  The Boneyard.  That's right.  Boneyard.  Boneyard.  Oh, is it Boneyard?  Now, really sell it.  Boneyard.  Really sell it.  The Boneyard.  I don't want people listening.  Really sell it.  What?  They said the Boneyard.  That's totally different. 
[03:16:00]  Okay.  A little more energy?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cat Jimmy Norton Obsessed on Boneyard.  11 a.m.  Yeah.  Like that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  What's going to happen when the madness comes from?  Let's get out, bro.  All right, Oscar.  We're going to talk about Tiger Woods next.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  His wife released a lot of shit.  Oh, really?  That's right.  Yeah.  A few minutes ago.  We're going to go over it.  Is that okay?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's get this.  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  Let's do this.  Cool.  Awesome.  Let's get this.  Let's do this.  That's cool.  Oh, I don't know.  So we were going to go to break right there.  Oh, that's right.  We're going to break.  Actually, actually.  Yeah, but you've got to be quiet so we can do that.  Take us to break, I think.  Yeah, come on.  Take us into a break.  But first, what are you thinking right now?  How to take guys to a break?  Oh, man.  That's disgusting.  What the hell?  This guy gets distracted so far.  What is it, Dan?  What is it?  What is it?  Oh, is that your logs?  Look at that.  That's a shiny shit.  No, it's shiny. 
[03:17:00]  What did you fucking shellack it?  Did you make that in woodshop?  And he just showed a picture of his shit.  But it's shiny.  And it is really shiny.  Holy shit.  What's that?  A fucking buff to a high finish.  Did you put gel on that?  It's fucking turtle waxes logs.  I have good lighting in my bathroom.  Wow.  Good lighting.  It works out for shit pictures.  Glistening duty.  You need good lighting.  If you're going to take shit pictures, you need good lighting.  Wow.  Johnny's asshole looks like a buffing wheel.  It just comes out all nice and shiny. 
[03:17:30]  Those are really nice shits.  Those are picture perfect duties.  That's really nice.  I'm upset that you guys are giving me shit on my perfect logs.  They're very, very nice and healthy.  No, it's because it was shiny.  It's great.  I wanted to key it.  They look like the inoculated arms that were chopped off in Apocalypse Now.  A pile of shiny logs.  Goddamn, man.  All right. 
[03:18:00]  Take us to break, Oscar.  Yeah, take us to break, Oscar.  Tell them what we're doing next so they stay around.  How do we do that?  I just say, hey, let's go break.  All right.  Cool.  Let's take a break then.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What are we going to talk about after the break so these people don't go somewhere else?  Yeah, you got to tease what's coming out.  I have a feeling they already went somewhere else.  They're already gone.  Yeah.  Stay tuned.  We're going to talk about Tiger Woods next.  Apparently, the soon-to-be ex-wife said something, so we're going to check it out next.  Soon-to-be ex-wife.  Soon-to-be.  Check it out.  She said next.  But they are divorced.  Oh, they are?  That happened yesterday. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, exactly.  It was the biggest fucking headline yesterday.  How do you work on this show and not know everything that's happening in pop culture?  Oh, well, see, the thing is that, yeah, I don't pay attention to details.  I mean, I watched a little bit on CNN last night.  But then I just hadn't really picked up on the details.  What did you see on CNN last night?  Now you got to ask him.  I apologize to people.  I know.  What did you see on CNN last night?  Or was it Fox?  You know, that's what you just said. 
[03:19:00]  No, no, I'm sorry.  It was yesterday morning.  Yesterday morning.  That's different than last night.  Yeah, I know.  Why was I thinking?  Oh, I was watching Back to the Future last night.  That's why.  I'm sorry.  I got those mixed up.  That's all.  You got Back to the Future mixed up with CNN?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know why.  That is great.  Somebody said, it sounds like someone's throwing knives at him as he's talking.  You sound like you're dodging knives.  It's like if you took our show and just spliced it and just took chunks out and then put it 
[03:19:30]  all back together.  With no context.  Did you hear what he said that he confused Back to the Future with CNN?  And he was actually watching Back to the Future last night and not CNN?  It was a long day yesterday.  I was running a bunch of errands and I did a couple oil changes.  So it was a crazy day yesterday for me.  That's why I got to make stuff.  But anyways, yeah, I did see it on Fox yesterday morning.  Back to the Future?  No, no.  Oh.  The Tiger Woods on Fox.  Tiger Woods?  Yeah, on Fox in the morning.  And yeah, we were just talking about the whole money.  We got to get you back before you fuck that Perkins waitress. 
[03:20:00]  No?  Oh, yeah.  Did you watch it?  No, no.  Well, not.  Who?  No, no.  What did you say on Fox?  Oh, Fox.  Yeah.  No, was it the story about the Tiger Woods?  Are we going to go to break or anything?  No?  Yeah, you're supposed to take us to break.  Okay, well, coming up next, Tiger Woods gets divorced.  Tiger Woods.  Up next, Tiger Woods gets divorced.  Cool.  What a great tease.  Break. 
[03:20:30]  Go break.  No, he's not.  I don't know what.  How am I supposed to do this?  Like, I don't know.  Is there a keyword or something?  You just shut up?  I mean, maybe shut up.  Try some keywords.  Because you're right.  There is a keyword.  Oh, yeah.  If you hit the right keyword, Travis does hit the button.  You're right.  Okay.  Ready to go.  You did pick up on something.  Okay.  Yeah.  Ready to go to break?  Take break.  No.  Oh, take break. 
[03:21:00]  He's cut.  No.  Open sarsaparilli.  Open Saskatchewan.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  You guys want to go to break?  Yes.  Let's go to break.  No.  Is that it?  Hopefully, I'm dying here.  You know how you sound when you say that, Oscar?  You're dying.  You're not dying.  You're killing everyone around you.  I know.  I know.  It's killing me.  Oh.  All right, cool.  Oh, my God. 
[03:21:30]  What the fuck?  We're supposed to be going to break, Oscar.  Oh, no, but for what?  You've never seen a fucking couple of friends docking.  What the fuck?  It's wonderful docking.  Thanks, Danny.  Yeah, it's like Avatar.  Yeah.  I haven't seen that movie.  That's irrelevant.  Oh, cool.  Anyways.  Cool.  Hit it.  Break.  Travis, you help me out, please.  Please.  Here we go to break. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, man.  Come on.  Are we on break?  Can I just...  Should I just leave?  We're on break.  Oh, cool.  Awesome.  See you guys later.  Where are you going?  No.  You guys are going on break.  We're on break.  Oh, you are?  Oh.  Hats are really groovy.  Hats.  You wear them on your head.  Hats.  Hats are many colors.  Like purple, green, or red.  Where's my hat?  Let me get this guy a hat. 
[03:22:30]  How about Ted's hatting for you?  We have the Peterson boat hat.  Oh, they're wearing moon dirt hats.  It's fun.  Sometimes they put on a little hat with the green lady on it.  They're putting a hat on a bomb.  She was wearing one of those wine hats, but it was like a beer hat with wine glasses.  Put another hat on it.  What do you refer to his hair as?  My hat?  A woman's hat with a target on it.  I want to wear a hat with a brim that's just covered in boogies.  Because you'll make me a hat with a buckle on it.  I like a belt buckle on a hat. 
[03:23:00]  The ice stockings.  They're buying hats made out of the same lead material you wear when you get an x-ray.  Big, heavy hats.  Those are heavy.  Lead hats.  It's like a 35-pound hat and your chin strap and your head just droops.  And my hats.  All your hats.  I have an x-ray hat and a Dodgers hat.  And a Yankees hat.  His hat was removed, fortunately.  It was like everybody just kind of kept under their hat.  The Flyers. 
[03:23:30]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to OB and Anthony.  It's going to sound a little distorted.  Spider-Bait.  I believe.  Doing Black Betty by Ram Jam, right? 
[03:24:00]  Tiger Woods' ex-wife, Elin.  I've been through hell.  This was just released.  I'm just looking at a picture of her there.  Yeah.  They call her the Nordic Bombshell.  Oh, yeah?  They rust-mire her name.  Ah, the Nordic Bombshell.  There's actually a cool picture of her with the kids.  Yeah.  It's like a two-page layout in the post. 
[03:24:30]  Not where I'm mentioned on page six.  But it's a two-page layout.  You're in the paper today.  They quoted my eat, pray, love joke from it.  I had no idea until someone tweeted it.  Oh, really?  But, yeah, there's a two-page color layout of the kids' party and Tiger and her.  Oh, just because Tiger's in it, you don't have to call it that.  That's it.  It's color-like.  End person.  End person.  End person.  End person.  It's always that, Jimmy. 
[03:25:00]  Finally, the voice of Elin is heard, this says.  Elin, who maintained her silence through the finalization of her divorce from Tiger Woods on Monday,  told People magazine that she just can't get that taste out of her mouth.  End person.  I guess no gag order, huh?  She's talking right away, right out of the box.  I've been through hell, she says, describing her anguish and humiliation  and learning of Woods' serial philandering, her decision to move forward as a single mother, 
[03:25:30]  and Woods' Thanksgiving 2009 car crash, the night her marriage began to dissolve.  For openers, Elin, whose ex-husband has been fodder for, really, they have to explain,  professed to have no idea that he was cheating and said she was blindsided by the affairs.  Okay.  Wow.  She had no idea.  I never suspected not a one, she said.  Damn.  He must have been good.  For the last three and a half years, when all this was going on, I was home a lot more with pregnancies than the children and my school. 
[03:26:00]  Than the children and my school.  Oh, than the children.  Maybe she speaks in broken English, because this is a little...  No, she had the pregnancies, then the children, then school.  Okay.  I was home a lot more with pregnancies than the children and my school.  Gotcha.  Do you want to read this?  I don't feel it.  No.  Okay.  I felt stupid as more things were revealed.  How could I not have known anything?  The word betrayal isn't strong enough.  I felt embarrassed for having been so deceived. 
[03:26:30]  I felt betrayed by many people around me.  Oh.  Initially, I thought we had a chance, and we really did try.  We tried really hard.  Hmm.  The seemingly daily discovery of another adalience was, she said, an emotional rollercoaster that caused her hair to fall out.  What?  And there were the unflattering Saturday Night Live and South Park parodies of Woods' car crash that Elin admits were pretty hysterical as well as totally untrue. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  Oh, so she said they were funny.  And she's basically saying that she didn't take a club to him.  She got a laugh out of it, though?  A laugh?  Of course.  Her version of the Thanksgiving car crash, she did not attack Woods or cause him to drive into a tree as he left her Orlando home.  I'm suspicious of that still.  Oh, my.  But if she's saying it, what are you going to do?  Oh, my.  Let's see.  There was never any violence inside or outside her home, she said.  The speculation that I would have used a golf club to hit him is just truly ridiculous. 
[03:27:30]  Tiger left the house that night, and after a while, when he didn't return, I got worried and decided to look for him.  That's when I found him in the car.  I did everything I could to get him out of the locked car, to think anything else is absolutely wrong.  Wow.  Including playing Dr. Laura audio really loud.  In person.  In person.  Yes.  He crashes in the neighborhood, and he was there for a while, and then she went and searched for him.  It just doesn't sound kosher.  Yeah, but I guess we've got to believe her at this point, right?  Yeah.  And if he left because they had a massive... 
[03:28:00]  I don't know.  Ultimately, she decided to divorce Woods.  She purchased a home in her native Sweden.  According to some reports, got as much as $700 million in the settlement.  That's not...  Didn't they say $100 million yesterday?  Yeah, $100 million.  I am now going to do my very best to show the children that alone and happy is better than being in a relationship where there is no trust, she said.  Elin, who credits her children, family, friends, and therapy with helping her through the turmoil,  tells of her sadness on one particular day after leaving Woods. 
[03:28:30]  I wasn't crying, but I was thinking.  And it was sad, Elin said.  Sam, she said, asked her.  Sam.  Sam, she said, asked her.  Mommy.  What race am I?  Where's your boo-boo?  I guess it was our Sam.  Where's your boo-boo?  Mommy, where's your boo-boo?  So I pointed at the area between my pussy and asshole, because I had injured at bike riding.  I hit a curb, and my pussy slammed into the front. 
[03:29:00]  Where's your boo-boo?  We're divorced now.  Well.  First name.  I smiled at her and said, Mommy's boo-boo is in her heart right now, but it will be better.  She looked at me and said, Can Sam kiss it and make it better, or maybe popcorn will?  I said, No, you can't kiss it, because that would require you sucking my tits, dummy.  Don't you have any anatomy ideas? 
[03:29:30]  I know I will have to come to forgiveness and acceptance of what has happened for me to go on and be happy in the future, she said,  and I know I will get there eventually.  But as for now, I just plan on having sex with another...  Yeah, I want to go to the Barclays tomorrow, Andy in Norwalk.  I'll watch some golf tomorrow.  The Barclays.  Yes, the Barclays.  Going to the Barclays. 
[03:30:00]  They were saying, too, that she's going to have a hell of a brand.  Yeah?  The Elan brand could be very lucrative.  Yeah, and what is his name?  Donnie Deutsch there was on TV talking about it.  Just imagine this.  You've got Tiger Woods.  He's a big Nike guy.  Fucking Adidas goes, you know what?  We need Elan.  Oh.  How much fun would that be on TV?  The competition.  Tiger's competition.  Sneaker competition.  You think?  What's she do, though?  She's not...  Who's going to wear fucking some broad's name on their feet? 
[03:30:30]  Who cares?  They're not going to have an Elan shoe.  But it's like, she's not athletic or anything.  Exactly.  She couldn't even...  How good is she at anything?  She couldn't even fucking smell pussy on his dick.  She's awful.  The stupid housewives have all sorts of products.  Do they?  So why not Elan?  Like what?  And I got Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka coming soon.  I didn't forget.  Oh, Brother Man.  Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  Brother Man, Brother Man.  Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  That was it. 
[03:31:00]  So that's her statement.  The Elan statement.  Good for her.  She's got some cash.  She's got the kids.  She doesn't have her dignity.  Nope.  She probably can't go back to her family.  I don't know.  That's all right.  You make her wash her hands all the time?  It's the fucking two months of sea I told you.  Exactly.  Sully the blunt line forever.  Well, yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Got to agree with you there.  Letterman went after Leno last night, Jimmy.  Oh, did he?  What happened?  We got the clip?  Yeah.  What happened?  What did he say?  I don't know.  It might be worth playing.  What's his problem?  Brian Williams went on because, you know, at times, Brian Williams likes to have a little  fun.  Yeah.  He's a fun guy.  He wants to show everyone that he can have fun besides being a newsreader.  Went on Letterman.  And because, you know, Brian Williams is part of NBC. 
[03:32:00]  Letterman had some fun with Leno through Brian Williams.  Ah.  But you probably go on the Jay Leno show, don't you?  I do.  We have a robust slate of evening programming.  Yeah.  But I don't like it when you go on that show.  It's funny because he doesn't like it when I come here.  Dave, could you not go on that show?  And now you're sounding like him. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  Why do you have to go on that show?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  A little imitation.  Oh, yeah.  He does these imitations.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  You would think it was the real guy winning in the ratings.  Didn't end there.  Oh, no.  Nice people will invite me on to do these shows.  Right.  And I enjoy it.  Because people don't.  Well, you're very good at it.  Oh, well, thank you.  And have easily, readily, and quite comfortably taken over this position from Mr. Brokaw in 
[03:33:00]  in several respects.  Well, thank you.  That's a high honor.  Yeah.  It's been, it'll be six years in December.  And while I still regard it as his chair I'm sitting in, I think that's natural.  Yeah, but here's the deal.  To be on the Jay Leno show, you've got to travel all the way to California.  True.  To be on my show, all you've got to do is catch a bus.  You're right, just the 104, 104 bus across town.  And we miss you when you're gone.  Those of us, I watch all your evening shows. 
[03:33:30]  Well, you don't watch the Jay Leno show.  Oh, no, I watch them all.  How do you watch them all?  You can't possibly watch them all.  I've got this TiVo.  And plumes, a smoke rise from that sucker at the end of the night because it's rolling  on everything.  That's not bad.  It didn't end there.  Oh, shit.  But I just, I like to think of you and me as more real guys as opposed to you and Jay.  That doesn't have a, I mean, you and I have a symbiotic kind of a thing going here, whereas 
[03:34:00]  you and Jay are just, hey, hey, how you going?  But you know what I mean?  You and I are the real thing, right?  Well, Indiana bred, and with me, it's upstate New York and Jersey Shore.  Kind of the heart of America, as I like to put it.  Jay would argue he's from a blue-collar suburb of Boston.  Blue-collar, he's got 400 cars.  Now, where, hey, so... 
[03:34:30]  What is it?  I mean...  What is he, does he give you a car every time you go out there?  I'll come out and do the show, I'll give you a car.  He has invited me.  I have been to Jay's garage.  You've been to Jay's garage?  I have, sure.  Oh, for God's sakes.  Yeah, sure.  Well, I'm a member of the family.  How, why do we not enjoy the fruits of our labor, Dave?  Whoa.  What's with Dave?  Is he a little jealous?  Oh.  About the cars? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, it's in there.  The garage?  Oh, it's in there.  Well, we do.  I'm not saying...  No, if he wants to...  He's got more cars than Avis.  That's fine.  I don't...  I have no problem with that.  My problem is, I'm just trying to tell you, you belong here, is what I'm trying to tell  you.  Well, that's very flattering, and thank you very much.  Topic two.  I don't want to leave topic one.  Oh, but I do. 
[03:35:30]  I really, really do.  Has he taken you a ride in one of those steam-powered cars that he's got?  Why?  Let's talk about Regis.  Why is Regis so obsessed with your life?  You drive him crazy by not socializing.  See, here's a good example.  I'd really rather he would spend more time with Jay.  Okay.  Wow, he's fucking... 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, what's he...  Fucking Brian Williams, mostly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's more silly.  Because then he can't...  They're on the same network.  Of course he's got to do some Lenno, right?  Yeah.  Good for him.  It's in in there.  Oh, what?  Not in there.  Oh, okay.  Finally.  Mercifully.  Well, I don't know about you, but I'm thinking we should get the fuck out of here.  There are appointments.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That need to be kept.  That need to be appointed.  I have to get over and do my show on the Boneyard. 
[03:36:30]  11 a.m.  Yes.  Yes.  One hour of music.  Yeah.  Nice.  People are saying it's the best show in the history of this platform.  Wow.  All right, I'll end with this.  It's a good one.  By people, I mean me and Bob Eatman.  What?  I said by people, I mean me and Bob Eatman.  Of course.  I'm the ones who are saying it's the best.  The bestest.  Marcus Thames.  What a great home run call last night.  Swung on and the drill to left. 
[03:37:00]  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Marcus Thames in a bullet line drive that soared into the Toronto bullpen.  Happy Thames are here again.  Now Marcus Thames drills a two-run home run.  And the Yankees now take a 5-0 lead.  No, he didn't.  He did not.  Happy what?  Happy Thames are here again.  It's kind of like Thames. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  But his name is Thames.  It just makes you angry.  Stop it already.  Just stop.  He's got to make...  Just stop it.  I can see him pawing over the roster.  Just pawing over it.  What do I say for Thames?  Happy Thames are here again.  That's a good one.  Happy Thames.  I'm going to use that.  It's not even close. 
[03:38:00]  Ugh.  Teeth itch?  Steve from Petro said,  It's Thames for Sterling's death.  Oh my God.  All right.  Why?  Isn't it Happy Days are here again? </pre>
