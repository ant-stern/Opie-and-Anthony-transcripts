<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing their show's controversial history and numerous FCC violations.  Opie's cough then sparked a conversation about the annoyance of sick friends versus the self-centeredness of being sick oneself.  This segued into a discussion about the frustrations of parenthood, specifically the anxieties surrounding children's public meltdowns. A caller, "Satan," shared his experiences with his 15-month-old daughter's tantrums in restaurants. The conversation then shifted to the hosts' personal lives and relationships. Jim Norton detailed his struggles with anger and conflict in his relationship, describing it as almost addictive despite his hatred for it. He discussed difficulties resolving arguments and feeling unheard, contrasting his approach to conflict with that of his partner.  Bob Kelly joined the show, offering his perspective on relationship conflict and his use of therapy to manage anger. The discussion touched upon the different ways men and women express anger, focusing on the perceived passive-aggressiveness of women and the men's resulting frustrations.  Norton recounted past relationship experiences, including an attempt to prove a theory about female infidelity and the difficulties following his sobriety.  A brief anecdote about a negative experience in Martha's Vineyard concluded this segment.  The entire segment was punctuated by frequent vulgar and offensive language.


The show continued with a comedian (whose name isn't specified) detailing a disastrous Martha's Vineyard trip with his girlfriend, focusing on his annoyance with her, culminating in an argument over a ham and cheese sandwich. He expressed regret for missing opportunities to have sex with other women. He also shared a past relationship where he dumped his girlfriend for an 18-year-old, only to be dumped himself when she found a wealthier suitor. This transitioned into a discussion of a Facebook video depicting slapstick violence against women in classic films, prompting debate on its acceptability then versus now.  Bob Kelly, along with off-air guests Otto, George, and Jason Ellis, joined the hosts in this discussion. The conversation then turned to a list of the most famous people, leading to a debate about the Beatles,  anecdotes about Gary Goleman's anger, Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter interactions with one of the hosts, and the comedian's dolphin swimming experience.  The segment ended with a discussion of a personal experience with a priest and the comedian's nose hair waxing.


The next segment heavily criticized Jesse Ventura's recent appearances on Piers Morgan and Howard Stern, focusing on his controversial views on 9/11 and the JFK assassination. The hosts critiqued Ventura's debating style, analyzing a viral video of a past appearance on their show, arguing the edited version misrepresented the exchange. They also debated Ventura's claims about his military service, particularly his use of the title "Navy SEAL."  Other topics included a discussion of a DJ caught with a transgender person; a "Meatloaf freak out"; Sammy Hagar's alien beliefs; Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up shows; Kirstie Alley's injury on "Dancing with the Stars"; and a vulgar critique of Wendy Williams' feet. Several callers participated in the Ventura debate, particularly regarding his military service. Otto and George were in studio, with Jason Ellis joining later. The segment was characterized by informal language, cursing, vulgar jokes, and personal anecdotes.


Jason Ellis joined the show as a guest, recounting a series of injuries: a bruised arm from being punched by Chuck, anal pain from a girl's shoe, and a hematoma requiring a needle injection after a Muay Thai kick.  He detailed injuries from animal bites (anacondas, lizards) and resulting infections, including staph infections, referencing MMA fighter Kevin Randleman's similar experience.  Ellis discussed his past substance abuse and current sobriety, followed by anecdotes about Anthony Cumia's cruise and Anthony's encounters with dolphins and casinos.  The discussion then shifted to the unpleasant aspects of air travel, including interactions with flight attendants.  The final portion focused on Ellis's skateboarding career, including a graphic description of a knee injury during a touch football game. He shared stories about other injuries, including a head injury and misdiagnosed anxiety attacks. He concluded by promoting his TV show, "Ellis Mania," and upcoming appearances. The conversation frequently involved crude jokes and references to sex, drugs, and violence.


The final segment featured Jason Ellis discussing his Fuel TV show, "Ellis Mania 6," detailing bizarre fighting events he organized.  The conversation then shifted to Otto, who had abruptly left the show before his scheduled interview, possibly due to anxiety or a panic attack. This led to a discussion of Otto's past behavior and recent comedy performance, including a joke about Elizabeth Taylor. Ellis shared stories from his past radio work, including extreme stunts and challenges in the evolving media landscape. He discussed his comedy tour, his dislike for traditional radio, and his preference for direct fan engagement.  He concluded by promoting his TV show, comedy tour, new book "Swinging for the Fences," and other colleagues.  Vulgar and offensive language was frequent throughout the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Shuggy-duggy, crack-crack.  Shuggy-duggy, crack-crack.  What is that?  That's a hell of a way to start.  You see that or my cough.  I'll take the dial tone.  Uh, hello?  Hello?  All right.  Good morning.  The phones just decided to answer themselves. 
[00:01:30]  I didn't do anything.  You all right, bro?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just a little tired.  A little tired?  Yeah, I took Theraflu.  Yeah.  Last night.  Theraflu, you sip like a real beverage.  It's, uh, yeah.  You can't chug those.  You don't do the NyQuil?  The DayQuil?  No, no, no.  Not during, because it will keep me up.  I can't have anything like that at night.  Right.  So I said, let me have Theraflu, because I'll sleep.  And, uh, I feel the cough coming.  And, uh, I was watching The Ultimate Fighter on DVR.  How's that?  It's good. 
[00:02:00]  It's good so far?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Only one episode.  It's very good.  So do you have the flu, you think?  No, no, no.  I don't feel bad enough for it to be flu.  I feel a little better.  Right.  Just the cough is here now.  I had a sore throat yesterday, but I'm good.  I am good.  Today, I thought it would either get worse or better, and it got better.  So I'm happy today.  Thank God.  Yeah.  That flu shot I got in, uh, I don't even remember now.  November?  Yeah.  Really fucking rocked.  It made you sick, though, right?  It made me sick, but not as bad as, uh, you know, an all-out flu. 
[00:02:30]  And I've been all right ever since.  Five, six months with nothing.  Yeah, I don't have.  I know it's not a flu.  It's like, you know, when you get the flu.  Right.  Oh, of course.  You're going to fuck out of it for two weeks.  With the aches.  Yeah.  Short throat.  This is just irritating.  Stuffiness.  Heaviness.  All that crap, right?  Yeah.  Just a little under the weather.  Mm-hmm.  And a little, but it's, it's weird.  Like, nobody cares when you tell them you're sick.  Like, God's like, I want to just say to everybody, it's like, how I'm sick.  And you want to just start going through, like, every boring aspect of it. 
[00:03:00]  And I know nobody gives a shit.  Nobody cares.  What do we want from others when we're sick?  Because we all do that.  I know.  You want to be, I think you want to be pushed into a bosom.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And just held.  Just nurtured.  Nurtured.  You're looking for nurturing and some sort of love.  And even, even your significant other will care for, I don't know, five minutes.  And then they'll be annoyed that you're sick.  And then you have to remind them, I'm sick, though.  That's why I'm doing what I'm doing.  It is amazing how angry I get when people, especially a girlfriend or whatever, will just, 
[00:03:30]  whenever you fight when you're sick, that's always the fallback argument.  I'm fucking sick.  How could you?  But, like, I don't care when somebody else is sick.  No, no one does.  You know?  I don't think about it.  I don't really care you're sick.  Yeah.  Well, I love you.  And I love you.  Yeah, no, but it's understandable.  You shouldn't.  We're guys.  We'll talk about this for five minutes, and then I'm hoping we have a good radio show today.  Your friend being sick is, I can't think of anything that affects me less than my friends 
[00:04:00]  being under the wall.  You don't want somebody to have a fucking, you know, tuberculosis.  Oh, no, no.  The sicknesses that you come back from is fine.  No, I was so happy.  I went to the cell last night just to get a few comics sick.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  I wanted to make sure that I was around Artie.  Spread the wealth.  Yeah, there's nothing better than being sick and knowing everybody's annoyed that you're sick.  And what'd you come down for?  It's like, eh.  I do that.  Yeah.  When an Iraq or someone comes in here sick, I'm like, what are you doing?  Go home.  I don't want to get sick.  And meanwhile, you're going to get sick. 
[00:04:30]  It's going to happen.  You're going to get on a plane or on a bus or on a train, you know, whatever.  You're going to get it from somebody.  If someone coughs on the sidewalk as you're walking by, do you get sick from that?  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure that crap out.  If someone's got the all-out flu, you could see shit dripping from their body, and they're  coughing or sneezing.  Because I quickly stop breathing, hold my breath.  Have I ever told you this?  No.  And try to walk as far as I can.  And then I finally breathe.  Well, because you're afraid the droplets might have landed? 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  Well, how do people get sick?  I don't know.  How does that shit spread?  Does it spread from a sneeze?  Sure, but it's not on the sidewalk.  So does it have to hit your skin, or do you have to breathe it in?  I mean, you need to get that into your system.  I mean, I do the same exact thing.  You do?  Absolutely.  See, I'm not...  If someone, like, you know, when you're passing somebody, you know, you're going one way,  they're going the other way.  Yeah.  They do some disgusting thing as you pass.  Yeah.  And it's just like the first thing in my head, it's just like, all right, well, you're not 
[00:05:30]  going to inhale until you're far away from this guy.  See, I'm not as crazy as people think.  Because I'm checking off things that make me crazy, and when I find out someone else does  it, then that's one less thing.  It's common sense.  At that point, all right, guy's sick, I don't want to breathe in his sickness, so I'm just  going to not breathe until I can't anymore.  But the question is, does that help?  I don't get sick that much.  We've got to ask Dr. Steve, because I'm telling you, sometimes I stop breathing to the point  where it's uncomfortable when I start breathing again.  And living in New York, you know, when you're in the suburbs, you don't pass many people 
[00:06:00]  that are sneezing and dripping fluids, but in New York, it's all the time.  It's always.  I'll just stop breathing and keep walking.  You ever try to stop breathing and walk?  You can't go too far.  You ever try, instead of just stopping completely, just you have a breath in you, and then you  try to exhale it for as long as possible, because as long as you're not inhaling, you're  in the clear.  And then you get that old air out of the lungs, and that always hurts.  You ever try that?  They say that's really good for you, to really push out a breath, because it gets, I don't 
[00:06:30]  know how true it is.  It gets the old air out, but you start coughing at the end.  Yeah, of course I'm going to cough.  The cough at this point is that dry, hacking fucking cough.  Yeah.  It's amazing how annoyed I get at other people's cough, too.  See, I should have stopped breathing right there.  No, I had to cover my mouth, though.  I always cover my mouth.  That goes through your mouth.  I know that much.  If I'm on a plane and somebody else is coughing, I guess I'm like, you, fuck. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Why would you try?  Meanwhile, I don't care.  I'll travel if I'm sick.  I never don't travel because I'm sick.  Well, we're mad at everyone else for leaving the house, for being sick, but if you're sick  or I'm sick, you leave the house.  Yeah, but you get annoyed at other people.  The rules don't apply to me.  Yeah.  It applies to everybody else walking the earth, not me.  But if they get annoyed, you're like, what the fuck?  I'm sick.  I can't help it.  Everybody gets sick.  Right.  I guess it's like if it's a kid crying, if it's your kid, it's like, well, you know,  come on, it's a baby. 
[00:07:30]  But if it's someone else's baby, you're like, what the fuck?  Why don't you ask me?  We haven't traveled yet, though, with the baby.  Huh?  You haven't flown yet.  Not flown, no.  Yeah, I don't know how we're going to handle that, but I don't mind my kid crying.  I still hate other people's kids when they cry.  Do you get embarrassed when your kid cries?  Like, oh, it's bothering other people.  Oh, I've been, I swear to you, I've been really lucky.  We take him to restaurants and a whole bunch of places,  and he doesn't act up.  We're lucky.  But then again, he's 11.  I don't know when that shit starts. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  11 months.  Right, right, right.  But I always wanted to parents get embarrassed.  I mean, I know it's a baby and you can't help it.  You know, kids cry, but it's been, some parents get embarrassed and like, oh, my God, I'm sorry,  I'm sorry, and they'll grab a kid and they'll run him out of a restaurant, a movie theater  or whatever.  And others go with the philosophy, yeah, it's a kid.  What do you expect?  It's going to cry.  Those people you want to strangle.  Sometimes.  I mean, we've talked about this on the show many times.  All I ask is you try.  Right.  That's all I ask for, because I understand that a kid's going to cry. 
[00:08:30]  But if you're sitting there going, ah, what are you going to do?  This is what he does.  He cries without at least attempting to calm him down a little bit or take him out of the  area.  That's my line.  That's when I lose my mind.  And then I wonder, am I being not compassionate because I don't have kids?  So it's like when I hear babies on planes, it's like, aren't we like the only species  that gets annoyed at kids doing what kids do?  Because they do cry, but as a generation or as people, well, it is what it is. 
[00:09:00]  Kids are, there's always going to be children.  So like, should I not just get annoyed at it?  And a baby crying is just brutal because that's nature, man.  That is, look, you got to pay attention to me because something is fucking wrong.  And you can't, there's no logic.  There's no rationale.  There's no way to stop it by talking to him.  There's no way to make the kid understand how annoying he's being.  It's just fucking.  You just got to try to do what you can to comfort him, you know?  So.  There was some flight to Brazil where the guy threw water, which, you know, the guy was  an asshole.  He threw water in the baby's face and he said he cried the whole flight. 
[00:09:30]  He didn't know the baby?  No, he wasn't with the mother or the baby.  He was arrested for it.  I didn't know that story.  That's probably a year ago, yeah.  Wow.  He threw water in the baby's face.  It's one of those Chris Rock lines, you understand.  Yeah.  Right?  You wouldn't do it, but you understand why someone might do something like that.  Yeah, I understand why people would do a lot of things that I probably wouldn't do.  Like, I would never yell at somebody's baby, but I understand how frustrating it is.  Of course.  I have to listen to it.  Let's go to Satan in Virginia.  Satan, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:10:00]  Anthony, of course, on a cruise.  He finally tweeted yesterday.  Oh, I didn't even read it.  Which was good.  He was Twitter dark for way too long.  And he had a quick tweet.  Maybe he tweeted more.  I don't know.  It said, what did he say?  He said something like, he took a lot of money from the casino and he swam with dolphins.  I think that's what his tweet was.  Something like that.  And we're hoping that he calls us from his satellite phone.  There's your Anthony update today.  Satan, what do you got, buddy?  I got a 15-month-old daughter. 
[00:10:30]  And, you know, whenever we go out, it's no problem usually.  But, like, we go to a fine dining restaurant every once in a while.  And, you know, she'll be perfectly fine up until the minute we go to sit down.  And then she starts crying or just, you know, being obnoxious.  And I'm fucking embarrassed as hell.  It's embarrassing.  So why do you guys go to a restaurant if you know the baby can't handle it?  No, because most of the time she's fine.  It's the same situation you have.  Like, it was around a year old is when she started to do it. 
[00:11:00]  And she won't sit there and cry, you know, so much.  But she'll suddenly just kind of whine that she wants her juice or some shit.  And it might only last for 30 seconds.  But you get really embarrassed.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, some people get embarrassed and deal with it.  And others, they just fucking go with emotions.  What do you do if the kid won't stop?  Do you carry her out?  I mean, you want to hold it out as long as possible because that's, I mean, you don't want to give in.  You know, just stupid shit for your kid. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  But if it goes on for too long, then, you know, I'll just, I'll pick her up and we'll just kind of walk around.  All right.  And that usually calms her down.  But, yeah, I mean, some people just take it too far and their kid just fucking screams and is on the ground having temper tantrums.  You know, and you want to tell them, like, fucking learn to be a parent, you asshole.  Get the fuck out of the restaurant.  I've seen the temper, the kids that have temper tantrums.  My kid does that.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving him there. 
[00:12:00]  I'm not dealing with that.  Oh, what happened?  Where the kid gets dead feet or dead body and just refuses to move and you, for some reason, you can't pick him up anymore.  I don't understand the physics of that.  The dead weight that a kid could do.  My kid, no way.  I'll just, I'll just fucking leave him.  Parents don't want to.  I'm not dealing with that.  They don't want to smack the child at all.  So they just, they just sit there and try talking like adults, but it's like, he's not an adult.  Right.  He's not going to respond to the calm logic of an adult.  Oh, of course not. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  All right.  I'm out.  Jimmy, I'll see you in D.C. here in a few weeks.  Oh, okay, buddy.  Yeah, I'm down there with the antisocial.  I'll see you, buddy.  All right, man.  You guys have a good one.  Later.  Yeah.  People want to talk about kids.  We're not going to do it.  I'm just curious.  We're just not going to do it.  Jordan writes, babies are faggots.  So that means we should move on.  Jordan summed it up.  He summed it up.  But it is a curiosity because it's something I just don't want.  I mean, I can't comprehend my life changing like that.  With a kid?  Can't do it.  No.  It hasn't been that bad.  No. 
[00:13:00]  I mean, the lack of sleep, but it hasn't been that bad.  We've been able to do just about everything.  Oh.  And we don't even really have help, so.  Are you going to get help?  I think we've got to get a little help.  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  If I had a little help, it would be a lot better.  I love it, but it's definitely a life changer.  But we've been able to do some things.  Yeah.  I go to Starbucks once in a while or some juice.  I run out for 15 minutes.  I went for a walk yesterday.  I get pretzels. 
[00:13:30]  It's funny when you look at the amount of...  You can only do things in short bursts because it's all built around a baby.  You can only...  You can't...  What can you do?  I tool around with them.  I just bring them with me wherever I want to go, so.  But you haven't really traveled, did you?  Nah.  Nah.  We might be on a plane soon, so.  I'll let you know how long it goes.  I might go down to the islands.  Okay.  Do my island trip.  How long the trip is that?  Three hours on a plane.  See, babies can't...  The problem is when you're taking off and landing, they're always going to cry because 
[00:14:00]  they can't...  They don't know how to pop their ears.  My kid, if I know him, he won't cry.  Most likely he won't cry.  You never know.  But he'll be awake the whole time, which will be a pain in the ass.  He'll want to be moving around, checking shit out.  So you're not a sleeper during the day?  No.  A little nap here and there, but he just wants to go, go, go.  Do you bring blocks and stuff for him?  Toys?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  They have babies spit on him?  Huh?  Let the kids drool on him?  Oh, yeah.  He sucks at everything. 
[00:14:30]  That would bother you?  Yeah.  It's amazing what a creep I am, but what I'm squeamish about.  But, I mean, nature takes care of that because babies don't really...  They don't have bad breath or bad drool.  Right.  Thank God.  Because just imagine if you walked around your house right now with just a bad breath  mouth and put your mouth on everything.  No.  What that would do to your house, right?  It would just stink.  Well, for some reason, babies' spit doesn't really fucking smell or anything, so you don't  really care after a while. 
[00:15:00]  It's probably because they eat just awful baby food.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, but we have to pack all sorts of shit while we leave.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Like a little thing of cookies and...  It's like being paralyzed, I tell people.  Just imagine what you do on a regular basis, and then just imagine trying to do all that  stuff paralyzed from the waist down.  So you still could move a little bit.  But you have a chair.  Yeah.  That's how it is to have a baby.  Everything is twice to three times as long. 
[00:15:30]  And it's just cumbersome.  And there's always something.  Yeah, there's always more planning.  I'm watching from afar, and I just don't comprehend.  I understand why people would do it, but my life would change so much.  I'm like, I just...  Well, when it's...  It's hard to explain, but when it's yours, then all those thoughts you have before you  have a kid, it doesn't even come into play.  When am I going to look at things different?  When am I going to want to get married?  Like, I don't...  I have no desire to be married. 
[00:16:00]  I love not being married.  But you love being in relationships.  I don't love it.  It is what it is.  You know, you...  So why do you do it, then?  Because there are things about it that I like, and I have fun with it.  You're always in a relationship.  Ever since I've known you.  In the last few years, I have been.  There was a long period, though, after my one girl and I broke up in, like, 2001.  Well, there was a few years where I had nobody.  I was just dating.  And now, I've been in a relationship for the last few years with different girls.  Is she hoping it moves forward? 
[00:16:30]  Or she knows what it is in the end?  I don't think she wants to get married, either.  But I just...  I like living separately.  Like, I can't fucking fight and then lay down next to somebody.  I get so...  I won't talk for two or three days.  I can't...  I just can't...  I have to decompress so I don't say anything stupid.  Like, if we're not talking, then I'm not saying anything horrible.  When you guys fight, you don't resolve?  In that moment?  Yeah.  Almost never.  So then you have to try to fall asleep.  That's impossible. 
[00:17:00]  If she's there, it is, yeah.  I just try...  I don't know how to resolve it when I'm that angry.  You guys fight a lot?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  It's just...  We just don't see eye to eye on things.  There's no...  There's no...  There's no reason in particular.  All couples fight.  But...  I...  With my life, when I've gotten in relationships where the fighting was too much,  I just...  I had to be gone.  I just couldn't deal with that.  I don't...  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I don't know if I want to...  I don't know if we're going to break... 
[00:17:30]  Do you like fighting?  No.  It's addicting.  Sure.  It's addicting?  Sure it is.  Like anything else.  There's power-driven arguments.  It's fucking hot in here, isn't it?  Or not hot.  Uh...  Maybe it was warm, because I'm a sweatshirt.  Um...  I don't know.  I like it.  What do you mean it's addicting?  I've never heard this before.  Anger.  Being angry.  That fucking...  I hate being angry.  It's a high...  I hate it, but I also don't hate it.  Like, I like it.  Or I wouldn't do it so much.  I get on these rage things, and it just feeds itself.  It feeds itself.  And it's addicting? 
[00:18:00]  Of course it is.  See, when I was going through many, many years of being angry, I hated it.  I was always trying to figure out how to fucking improve myself and get out of that shit.  It's...  I hate...  And I'm glad that I don't, like, act out as much as I used to.  I'm so glad.  Hating it, yeah.  Like, a lot of fat people hate the fact they eat sweets, but they still eat them.  No, but you're saying it's addicting.  That's very interesting.  Yeah.  Because you're talking to someone that got angry a lot, and it was never addicting to me.  It really just bothered me that I had this feeling inside.  You don't think it was addicting?  Maybe you didn't know it was addicting? 
[00:18:30]  Like, sometimes you do things and you don't realize, like, wow, I really am...  I'm perpetuating that.  I know I do it.  I didn't like that version of me at all.  And I didn't...  I didn't find it addicting.  I found it annoying.  I found it almost like a chemical reaction inside, and now I have to fucking deal with  this for a day or two.  Yeah.  Almost like a chemical imbalance, I guess.  I don't know.  I'd never found it addicting.  No.  I never got off on it.  I don't either.  I don't like...  When you're addicted to something, do you have to get off on it? 
[00:19:00]  No.  See, I don't understand this whole thing.  I heard once they were talking about, like, being angry or sad or feeling bad.  You can get, like, a really misshapen pleasure out of it.  Like, it becomes comfortable.  It's almost like...  I understand that it becomes comfortable thing.  Like, why would a girl whose father beat her become addicted to abusive relationship?  It's like she doesn't like being fucking belted, but on a part of her, she craves it.  It's weird.  Yeah, I understand that.  That's kind of the way it is with anger.  It's like, I know how fucking bad it is. 
[00:19:30]  And I mean, getting angry is whatever.  Right.  But the fear...  I bit my lips so hard the other night.  Like, I just...  The rage comes over me.  It's like, it's just...  You're not being fucking heard.  The other person is talking, and then you say something, and they quote, and it's like,  I didn't just say that.  You're making it up as you go along.  That's what drives me crazy.  You know?  And I don't see any way around that.  Every relationship...  I don't know how...  I've said to her so many times, and she agrees.  I'm so fucking happy I'm not married to you. 
[00:20:00]  And I mean, because then you're legally bound to each other.  This way, it's like, you go to your place, I'm here at my place.  This fight is getting ugly, but I have to get up in the morning.  I'm not going to fucking argue with you tonight.  But it's really frustrating, man.  Wow.  It's really difficult.  And the anger...  I can decompress sometimes if I stop it.  If I see the big fight coming, and I'm like...  And I'm angry, I'm going to say, go home.  Not like, go fuck yourself and die, but look.  Just go home.  You relax, I'll relax. 
[00:20:30]  That's why we have two apartments.  It's great.  But even in that situation, she understands that you're really angry.  So doesn't she want to just get into it at that moment, no matter what you say?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of times the fight continues.  I have to throw her out.  Throw her out?  Oh, yeah.  But it's like, just...  It's not...  It's not...  Get out of my...  It's like, just...  It's not...  It's like, I don't want to fight.  And I'm not going to stand there and just scream in my apartment.  I won't do it.  Right.  I won't scream in my apartment.  It's embarrassing.  It's like, I have neighbors, they're nice people.  I'm not going to be that guy. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  Huh.  But it's hard to fucking...  I understand the comfort thing.  Because when you try to change yourself, you realize it's very uncomfortable.  No.  Because you know what you know.  And even though it might not be the greatest situation, the greatest thing, there's a comfort  to that.  Like, I haven't really talked about it much, but, you know, my last relationship, I stayed  years longer than I should have.  Because it was just comfortable.  Right.  It was just a comfortable situation.  You know, I was scared of the unknown.  I was scared of, you know, just moving on. 
[00:21:30]  And what that meant.  And I could have been a lot happier through all those years at NAW.  Yeah, you started to get scared.  But it's a comfort thing.  Yeah.  But man, when you step out of that comfort zone, it's kind of a cool place.  Yeah.  If you're brave enough to do it.  The problem is most of us aren't.  Or it takes a lot.  I feel like...  And then when you change, your friends and your family around you feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes.  Because you're changing.  Yeah.  Because then it fucks up their dynamic. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  And what they're used to.  Well, they don't...  They're used to A, B, C, D, one...  Each letter going back and forth.  And then if you're not giving them back what they want, they don't know how to react.  Right.  You know, yeah.  People kind of like when you...  I hate to say stay sick.  But people like when the status quo is what it is.  Because then they know how to treat you.  Right.  Then they know how to react to you.  Right.  But I don't know how to fucking not be angry because I feel like I'm losing.  If I don't react angrily, I feel like I've lost.  Like I've been beaten or I've been dominated by somebody. 
[00:22:30]  And it's so stupid.  So what are you doing with your anger?  Or...  It just comes and eventually I get rid of it.  I mean...  And I bet you it's over simple things, right?  It's never a major thing.  90% of it.  Is over some just mundane thing that in the end is like, what the fuck's wrong with me?  Feeling like you're not being heard.  That's 90% of why I get mad and rageful.  It's not when my girlfriend doesn't agree with me.  It's when I feel like I'm talking and I'm alone in a room. 
[00:23:00]  And it drives me nuts.  Like when you're arguing a point or you're talking a point.  And then they just make the point for something else.  It's like, that's not what I just said.  Like you're literally...  You're making this impossible.  I can't win with you.  Meaning, no matter how I explain it, you're going to be confrontational.  And that gets a little bit frustrating.  That gets a little bit frustrating.  But I'm bad with problem solving. 
[00:23:30]  I remember my ex-girlfriend said to me, you know, I'm trying to find a solution to this.  Like whatever it was we were fighting about at the time.  Right.  And I'm like, yeah, you know what?  I'm really not good at that.  I don't want to find a solution.  I want to keep arguing when I'm angry.  I want to keep going.  Hi, sweetie.  Why?  Because you have to get it out?  Yeah, you get that.  I have to get it out.  I have to throw it up.  Or I feel like, again, because once I'm into it, it's very hard to stop.  It's like rolling downhill.  It's very, very difficult to stop. 
[00:24:00]  It's very difficult to kind of put the brakes on and say, let's stop fighting.  I don't know how to do that.  I don't know how to, when I'm angry, say, let's stop arguing.  I don't think anyone does, though.  Some people do.  Really?  There are women I know have done that.  Like, I will be fighting and they'll go, look, I don't want to fight anymore.  I just want to stop.  I think women are better at that.  I don't think that they look at everything as it has to be a win-loss.  But then they resent themselves and resent you, meaning you, the male, for fucking, because 
[00:24:30]  they feel like they gave up when they didn't want to.  Right.  Like, I hate when my girlfriend will apologize to me and go, and I know she's not sorry.  I know she just wants to stop fighting, but she's going to resent me because she feels  like she compromised.  Like, she's just going to be fucking mad at me.  And, uh, like, you know when it's coming.  Like, you know what I mean?  When you're talking and you get this, she's staring straight ahead at something.  You're like, I know, I feel.  And then I'm being a guy I don't like.  Because I want to go, what the fuck is your problem? 
[00:25:00]  Shit attitude.  But I can't because I'm like, I know that that's going to start an argument.  Right.  So, I just keep talking and be happy.  Like, when Anthony talks about his, the woman he was with at one point was a drinker, and  he would just say to her before, like, let's not fight tonight.  Now, I don't date people that are that crazy, that are drinking, but I hate myself for being  that guy.  Like, if someone's being cunting to me, I immediately want to go, what are you doing?  Right.  But I know if I do, it's going to be a fucking four-hour brawl. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  So, then I start to resent myself and fucking hate her.  You know, or whoever.  And again, that's every girl I've dated that happens with.  So, I know I'm a big part of it.  How many days can you go without fighting with her?  I can go a long time.  We actually can go a month without fighting.  Like, yeah.  When we get along, we get along great.  I mean, really, really well.  And then we go through these patches where we fight, and it's fucking, it's so frustrating. 
[00:26:00]  It's so frustrating.  Because you just want to, you know.  Hi, Bob Kelly.  Yeah, Bobby walked in the middle.  Bob just casually walks in not knowing that it's getting, we started off a little serious  today.  I was listening to before to your sniffles and cold.  Yes, I'm a little ill.  And then I walked in and it's pretty serious.  I like it, though.  I feel the same way.  I've been going to therapy for five years.  Can you stop a fight?  Because you're married.  Can you stop yelling and shit in the middle of it?  You and your wife are married?  I mean, this may, as gay as it sounds, my therapist, I mean, told me in the fight, 
[00:26:30]  when she does those fucking passive aggressive things that, because I was, you know, me, I  get the same anger as you, but mine gets, I don't, I would never hit a woman, but I  start breaking shit and slamming shit and fucking.  Really?  Yeah, my dog's got a fucking complex now.  When I raise my voice even this loud, my dog shakes.  One of my, Kelby just shakes.  Creep.  I love Kelby. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I know.  Why would you do that to, what is it?  Kelby.  Kelby.  What are you doing to Kelby?  Ah, fuck him.  Get your shit together.  He even made it through.  Fucking dumb dog.  Skittish.  Fucking bugs me.  Thunders up.  He's shaking.  I'm going to give him a pill.  I'm very scared.  You give your dog pills?  I don't.  My wife does.  Get the fuck out of here.  He, yeah, I used to, I get mad, but he actually, he told me, and this is fucking the  gayest thing ever, but he said that the only reason why you get angry is because she hurt 
[00:27:30]  your feelings.  Just say to her, you hurt my feelings.  That really hurt what you just said.  And it's fucking gay.  I know it.  But it, it literally eliminates all her bullshit because you're playing their game now.  They want, she wants you to get mad because that's, she wants you to flip out.  She needs you to flip out because then you're going to do, you're wrong too.  So no matter whatever the fuck she did, you could have been totally right.  But now that you're snapping, saying mean shit, calling her fucking idiot, hurry the fuck 
[00:28:00]  up.  Now you're, now you have to apologize too.  Women want, they'll apologize, but they want to get you to a point where you have to say  sorry too.  We'll actually just say sorry without them saying sorry.  If I fuck up, I'll be like, look, I fucked up.  I apologize.  So it actually switched the thing where I'd be like, you know, look, you, that fucking  hurt what you just said.  I, it's gay.  But she would just sit there like, oh fuck.  I, I, I'm sorry.  I, I didn't mean that.  But one thing too is that we, guys like me and you with our type of anger, we want to 
[00:28:30]  fucking get it out with that person.  Cause I'll fucking be home talking to myself.  I'll drive me in a cab fucking having the conversation with myself.  I'll be like, you fucking cunt for all night.  I'll go to bed fucking literally still having the argument in my head with that person that  I fucking hate.  So we want it when we can get it out with that person and be in a safe way.  Cause you can't do that at the comedy club with a comic.  You can't do that with somebody on a set.  You can't do that at certain places where you can go, you fucking it. 
[00:29:00]  Cause you'll fuck up your career in some cases, but with a woman, it's safe to do that  because you know that they, they understand you in a fucked up way and they're not going  to leave you.  But what about, this is the worst when you, when you do that, like not say you hurt my  feelings, but when you try, we fought recently and I tried really rationally explaining,  keeping it on myself.  And look, this is why this bothered me because I felt like, you know, I tried keeping it  on me, not saying you fucked up, you're stupid, all on me. 
[00:29:30]  Like, and then you get immediately, she takes that as how, how it's a reflection on her.  But I didn't, I'm like, I didn't say you and I can feel my blood pressure rising.  So I'm like, I've tried to do this right and nicely and not blame you.  And you're being a victim.  Like you want to be a fucking victim.  Like that shit.  I hate, but she's sick too, though.  That's the one I was going to therapy for three years.  And then I went home one day.  I go, it's fuck you.  It's not just me.  Right.  I hear, call this fucking number and you go too, because you're fucked. 
[00:30:00]  You have some fucked up shit.  I mean, not that you had, she had to fucking go as much as I had to go, but it's like,  you're fucked up too.  Right.  So fix your shit.  You can't just blame me.  No, it's, I took it all on though.  Right.  Because I was like, I know I'm a fucking lunatic.  I know I'm a fucking creep.  I know I have all the, I'm a fucking addict, sex, everything.  So I blame me.  It was me.  It's my fault.  Well, she's a perfect woman and you know, she, you know, she doesn't flip out. 
[00:30:30]  She doesn't break shit.  She doesn't get a temper.  She's passive aggressive.  All her shit is under fucking neath.  And you literally would have to hire an investigator to fucking write down clues to, to fuck me.  You can just take me to court and I'm fucking guilty because this video of me just smashing  a bottle of wine over a fucking ham her.  It's all underneath and because guys like us, what we do for a living is we can see shit  and take it apart and put it back together and tell people about it. 
[00:31:00]  You, you, your instincts are fucking super sensitive.  So you know, when someone's fucking being addicted, you know, and fine always means doesn't  mean fine, it means you're a fine, okay.  And you're like, fuck you.  I said, fine.  What do you want?  I know what you fucking meant.  And other people would be like, she said fine.  Fuck you.  Exactly.  But let me, let me ask, let me ask both of you a question.  Have you fought this much in every relationship, relationship you've been in or it's the one 
[00:31:30]  you're in Bobby and the one you're in Jimmy?  I'd say every one.  I mean, I'm the same guy.  The old expression.  So is that your problem?  Part of it is sure.  I seek out that, but I also, I perpetuate that too.  Like that's what I'm saying about it being addicting.  It's like I do.  And I have fought like that with every chick.  But what Bob's talking about is right.  Like you, you just know.  And it's like, I can't explain to her.  It's like, I'm doing it for 20 years. 
[00:32:00]  It's like when somebody heckles you or, and life is not all heckling, but you're, you're  talking, a total stranger says something to you or makes a noise or hurt or does something  or is like, Hey, whatever the fuck he does from the audience, you know, immediately why  he did it.  Is he having fun with me?  Is he the loud guy just trying to be funny with his friends, not realizing he's being disruptive?  Is he a cocksucker who's jealous?  You, you immediately have to fucking pick that out.  Sometimes you have to talk to him for a second and get it.  Yeah.  But you always know. 
[00:32:30]  Once in a while you're wrong.  Like the lady who was on the phone, I thought she was being a cunt, but her daughter just  got in a serious car accident.  And I actually fucking called her a cunt for being on the phone.  You were right though.  Why didn't she, was she walking out of the room or was she sitting there?  She was sitting there and she was just about to fill up with tears.  And I was like, put the fucking phone down, you cunt.  She's like, my daughter just got into a car accident.  I'm like, oh, shut up.  I'm sorry.  She's like, I'll leave.  All right, fine.  As long as she leaves.  99% of the time.  You're absolutely right.  At that point, she's just in shock taking a phone call.  That is true.  She's not thinking, wait, maybe I should take this horrific phone call outside with the 
[00:33:00]  smokers.  Sometimes you do have to take a minute to talk to them and find out.  But yeah, you're absolutely right.  You have the instincts.  But I mean, yeah.  That's a rare fucking incident.  Bob found the one fucking example of legitimate cuntiness.  I'm talking about heckling.  All right, I didn't realize I had to put this little fucking asterisk.  Aside from the death of family members finding out during the show, you immediately.  Jesus, Bobby.  Let me just say, too, like, if you're ever doing a show on stage, like, say you're in 
[00:33:30]  Japan, the tsunami hits, and they all run out the door.  That's not heckling.  I mean, I didn't realize I had to cover every base.  Fucking Bobby.  But you know immediately why that person is.  Like, I told you, one of my way, way, way in the beginning, I got heckled by a guy.  I was on stage at Rascal South, and he was a fucking guy with a, thanks, Kenny.  He was a guy with a shirt and tie.  You know, this is an office guy.  And he was heckling me, being funny. 
[00:34:00]  But I saw his face, and I knew he's trying to undermine the show.  Like, he's one of those guys who's used to being the funny guy.  So I brutalized him.  I was a dick to him.  And people, the audience turned on me because I wasn't good enough back then at letting  them know what a cocksucker he was being.  Right.  But I knew what he was doing.  They were just hearing the words, but I saw his fit.  And it's like, that's the type of stuff.  When you're arguing with the person, you can't say to your girlfriend, like, I fucking, I  can look at your dumb face and know exactly why you're saying this. 
[00:34:30]  Just say it.  You're mad.  I'm not mad.  No, never.  You literally, you'd have to take them to some type of court.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Where the judge would have to, because they'll never admit to it.  It's like, I knew a girl was cheating on me.  I actually went to her house.  I go, just tell me.  I sat there for an hour and a half.  Just tell me.  She's like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Just tell me.  Hour and a half in.  She took a deep breath.  Okay.  And I was like, oh, fuck.  I know.  She goes, how did you know?  I just fucking know. 
[00:35:00]  That's what comics have.  That Spidey sense of instantaneously reading somebody's energy and body.  You're out in the public so much interacting with them.  You just can read them.  Yeah.  So your wife or your girlfriend, it's two seconds.  She doesn't have a chance.  No.  Because you already know what she's thinking.  But once they acknowledge, my chick kind of knows that now, because I've explained that  to her.  You're not going to get away.  That's my fucking, that's my superhero strength.  You're not going to get away with your bullshit. 
[00:35:30]  And the fights now, I haven't got angry in a long time.  Like, really angry.  I've done some fucking stupid shit, punching fridges and ripping cabinet doors off the  fucking wall.  Is it always awkward to put all that stuff back together the next day?  I tell you, one time we were fighting, and it was really over nothing.  And I slammed the cabinet, really, like, I was really making a great point, too.  And I slammed the fucking cabinet, and there was a wine rack on the wall behind it with 
[00:36:00]  four bottles of wine and all these wine glasses that her father gave her.  And just instantaneously, boom, chunk.  The whole thing.  And I just heard, my father's glasses.  And I was like, oh, fuck me.  Did I end the fight?  Yeah, I ended the fight.  It was fucking three hours of cleanup.  There was four bottles of red wine.  Red wine everywhere?  Everywhere.  Just, oh.  And then, but this is where she turns into a fucking twat. 
[00:36:30]  Because I'm like, look, I fucked up.  Let me help you clean it up.  Let me clean it up.  She's like, I got it.  I'll do it.  And I'm like, just let me help you.  I got it.  Just leave.  Now it's okay for her to.  See, even then, it's like, I fucked up.  I, you know, I'm apologizing.  But now it's your chance to get angry and say, I got it.  Make me feel more like shit.  It's fucking crazy.  They're nuts, man.  Women are fucking nuts because it's passive aggressive.  I'd rather have her go, you're a fucking cunt.  Shut your fat face. 
[00:37:00]  Why are women passive aggressive in general?  Because we used to beat the shit out of them if they talked back.  It's just deep in their DNA.  Yeah, we used to just fucking crack them.  We're actually going through this weird transition right now.  We have to, you know, we're holding, we're trying to smack them with words.  Yeah, we've actually, against all instincts, we actually listen to them.  Like, what's wrong, honey?  Did we, Iraq, did we paste that?  Did we post that, excuse me, on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony? 
[00:37:30]  No, but I'll do that right now.  Oh, you should.  There is a video, because you say they just used to being hit.  It's called The Golden Age of Face Slapping.  And it's a montage of women getting slapped in movies not that long ago because it was accepted.  Even Ronald Reagan is in this montage slapping abroad.  I like that.  So what you're saying is, like, you know, they're used to being hit.  You're not too far off.  Yeah, what are we, 30 years out from just hitting, hitting broads? 
[00:38:00]  Danny, can you grab that?  It's on, it's on my, my new Facebook page if you want to go there.  But we should put it on opandanthony.com as well.  Yeah, I would, I mean, I would not, look, I actually hit a girl once in my life.  Oh, it must have felt great.  No, it actually felt like shit.  After.  But in that moment.  Oh.  Immediately after it felt like shit.  But that was when I was, like, young, drinking and all that shit.  But, yeah, you don't want to, you don't want to fucking hit them.  But if you did hit them, I think, I think that's the, that's, they're not aggressive with us the way we want them to be, to have that argument. 
[00:38:30]  I'd love to have that argument with my wife.  I'd love to her, to be able to argue back.  To make points and, and own, okay, I'm wrong, but you fucking, okay, that's true.  It's just this quiet face.  And then, you know what they also, they get to do that we don't get to do?  Cry.  They get to cry.  They get to, at one point, well up tears in their eyes.  And now you feel fucking, and it's like, really?  I've yelled at my wife sometimes. 
[00:39:00]  I'm like, no, fuck you, grow up.  Don't fucking cry.  We're adults having an argument.  But this crying bullshit, you're just trying to do that to fucking end the argument.  And never, it never moves me.  If a girl is crying while I argue, literally, it could be fucking rain on the window for all I care.  Really?  Yeah, because it's, we're in the heat of battle.  It's like, I really do, it is a one loss situation.  I can't, dude, if my, if a girl cry, I'm done.  I don't care if I catch her blowing my dad.  And she's like, I fucked up.  And she starts crying.  I'm like, it's probably my fault somehow. 
[00:39:30]  Finish.  Go ahead, finish.  Really?  You feel bad?  Yeah, when a woman cries, I'm fucking finished, dude.  I'm done.  That's the end?  Not with Jimmy.  I've learned that.  No, I'll keep arguing.  Yeah, Jimmy gets mad.  After I feel, like, after, once it's over, once the argument is done, and again, I've decompressed  or I've relaxed, then I feel horrible.  Like, a lot of times I go over and, like, I think, and this is, I've done this very good  off day, like, I start thinking of the good qualities.  I start thinking about them being hurt.  Like, if something bad happened to them, how awful would I feel? 
[00:40:00]  Like, you know, then I'm like, oh, man, you really love this person.  Like, you know, I just, it's very hard for me to get to that point.  You have to, you have to, you have to remember the odds of you being with a chick that you  can stand for more than fucking a day.  I'm fucking astronomical.  Every chick I've ever been with, I can literally last a day and be like, I can't be around this  brother.  But your chick, I can be around my wife for fucking three months.  And for the majority of it, it's going to be fucking awesome.  Right.  You know, we'll get into fights, but for the most part, I can be around her all the fucking 
[00:40:30]  time.  Yeah, well, I mean, fighting is normal, obviously, as long as you're not obsessively doing it.  Do you guys yell when you fight, you and your wife?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've never seen you guys, in all the years I've known her, I've never seen you guys yell  at each other.  Well, we don't do it in public.  Yeah, but still.  I've never seen you yell at a girl in public, either.  That's true.  Have you ever seen me?  He actually grinds his teeth.  No, I've never seen you.  Oh, yes, I've seen you.  I've seen you annoyed, but you keep it to yourself.  No, that's true.  All right, yeah.  Yeah, we yell.  Absolutely.  You don't really yell in public, though.  You do that fucking.  No, I can't. 
[00:41:00]  Listen, we're going fucking home.  Let's fucking shut your fucking face, all right?  You said we'd be at the mall for fucking two hours.  Now we're going the fuck to the car, okay?  And you're smiling while you do it.  Okay, let's go.  Okay, you fucking cock-sucking fucking car, motherfucker.  Yeah, but I like to do that on purpose, just so that other people can hear you as you walk  by, where you do the goon arm, and you're like, we're not getting that bag.  Let's go.  I was on a boat to Martha's Vineyard, and I told her to get me an egg and cheese.  She came back with a ham and cheese.  I go, what the fuck?  And that got you going? 
[00:41:30]  I don't know why.  You're going on vacation.  No, it was a long...  We were coming back.  It was a long weekend.  Oh, you guys didn't get along.  It was like when we first kind of met, and it was just a fucking...  She had been up my...  Wait, when you first met?  Yeah, but when I first met her, dude, I didn't have...  I had a girl when I was 18, okay, and then she cheated on me, and then I went on a tear  of just fuck, brah, fuck them.  Just fuck them.  If I started liking a girl, I would try to get her to suck my friend's cock, so it would 
[00:42:00]  prove my theory that she was a whore and she would cheat on me.  That is just fucking great.  I know.  You thought I was going to say Twisted.  That's just great.  It really is.  You're a fucking weirdo, man.  That's fucked up.  Where does that come from?  Because I got fucking...  The one girl that I fell in love with, Fufus.  I think we all got fucked by a girl, though.  She fucking cheated on me, and bro...  Dude, I was writing fucking poems in a library.  Jimmy and I both turned away from you. 
[00:42:30]  That's uncomfortable.  Yeah, but I was like a few years sober.  You know, before you get sober, you're fucking a drug addict, alcoholic, kind of cool guy.  Then when you get sober those first three years, you're this just fucking flimsy little  soft-shell crab.  You know what I mean?  When you talk to girls, you're like, yeah, God's good.  You bring up God.  Like, I believe in a power greater than myself.  You're a crustacean in between shells.  Yeah.  Looking for a bigger shell to live in.  And it's like...  So vulnerable.  That's the one thing that got my groove back was her cheating on me, but I was... 
[00:43:00]  I didn't think people did that.  Do you have those poems, Bob?  I do.  I would love...  I would love to hear Bob's poems.  Why would you come in here without poems?  We want your poems.  We want your poems.  I would bring in the one...  I think there's one line, like, clouds in my coffee or something.  I got some real...  Oh, yeah.  Would you steal your Sylvain and just read it to her?  Is that not...  Your Sylvain, clouds in my coffee.  Nah.  I don't know.  Oof.  I was in a library just sitting...  I remember it was raining out.  It was cold rain, like winter rain, that slushy euth rain, and I was by myself just writing 
[00:43:30]  these poems.  And literally...  But I couldn't show anybody.  You know, you can't just...  Hey, dude.  You know, want to read that?  Please bring him in.  I will.  Please bring him in.  Yeah.  So, I think that's where that comes from.  And with her...  For me to like this girl, I didn't put up with any shit back then.  So, it was like, you fucking...  I told you to get me an...  And it just started off like this.  I told you to get me an egg sandwich.  And this is what she did. 
[00:44:00]  This is a perfect example of a woman.  Wait.  No, no, no.  I got to slow you down.  What happened in Martha's Vineyard that you're so annoyed on the ride back?  Because I was going to...  Because anyone that goes to Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket, I've been to these places.  It's usually a nice fucking love weekend.  Oh, fuck Martha's Vineyard is the worst...  Romantic weekend.  The worst place I've ever had.  So, you guys obviously had a shitty time and this was the...  I didn't want to...  I was going to Martha's Vineyard.  I was new in comedy.  Here I am going to an island, a vacation spot.  And now I wanted to go by myself because I wanted to bang broads. 
[00:44:30]  I wanted to go do a spot, be around, and fuck some chicks in Martha's Vineyard for the weekend.  That's my mentality.  Oh, you were doing a gig there.  I'm doing a gig.  Gotcha.  And now it's a big thing.  And now she kind of weaseled her way in.  You know what I mean?  Like, maybe I'll go with you.  And I was like, yeah, yeah, we'll see.  And I kind of gave...  That was the first time that I was like, you know what, Bob?  Fuck it.  Bring her.  We'll see what happens.  And that intimacy...  I wasn't used to that intimacy, being with a woman overnight, that type of shit for a weekend.  I was used to going, doing shows, talking to chicks, fucking them in a bush in front of the comedy club. 
[00:45:00]  You know what I mean?  And then banging another broad.  So you were mad that she wanted to have a nice weekend with you in Martha's Vineyard.  I mean, we were in the fucking...  But she weaseled herself into what she thought would be a nice weekend with a guy she might be in love with.  The actual Martha's Vineyard aggravated me, too.  The fucking dumb boat over there.  All the fuck...  You have to take vans.  There's no cabs.  You have to take a van.  And everybody's just so fucking happy to be there. 
[00:45:30]  It was a shithole.  It was a fucking shithole.  You picked the wrong place to fucking stay.  Yeah, I'll never go back to Martha's Vineyard.  I've never been there.  It's fucking a shithole.  I like Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard.  It's just stuck in time.  It was like when the Kennedys were fucking famous.  A bunch of shit dicks with money.  They filmed Jaws there, though.  I wish Jaws still lived there and fucking attacked all the people.  Did you go to some of the places where you're like, oh, wow, Jaws was filmed right there.  No, because that's not what I did back then.  I went, I slept all day, I did the show at night, and tried to bang broads, and stayed up all night trying to get pussy. 
[00:46:00]  You know what I mean?  But you were the one that committed to this girl.  I know.  I fucked up.  You commit to her.  Hold on.  I've got to be the sane one in the room for a minute.  So now you commit to her.  Yeah.  Instead of banging a different broad every night, you're like, I think there's something with this girl.  So then she's feeling it, too.  So she wants to go to Martha's Vineyard to have a nice weekend with you.  And now you're mad that she's squeezing in on the fact that you want to bang broads.  Yeah, and then, and don't even add this in there, that Kevin Knox, who's one of my all-time favorite comedians from Boston, I looked up to him. 
[00:46:30]  He's on the gig.  He's the headliner.  So I get to hang out with Kevin Knox.  That's a big thing for a young comic.  When you get to be with that guy, that's when you get to bond.  I'm with her.  And I remember we're in the cab, and she got a little drunk.  And my wife, when she gets drunk, she talks.  She becomes a talker.  And I remember her going, Kevin, we should go out to, he's literally talking to Kevin.  I haven't talked to Kevin.  I haven't fucking talked to him. 
[00:47:00]  And she's like, we should go out to breakfast tomorrow.  Are you doing anything for breakfast?  Yeah, and I heard they have, and I, yeah, my friend told me, my friend Ann told me that there's a place for breakfast.  And he's like, yeah, yeah.  And I know him.  I know comics.  He's like, oh, this fucking twat.  Were you annoyed?  I was so annoyed.  So annoyed.  And I was so mad at myself.  And I was just like, fuck.  I remember sleeping in the bed, just looking at the ceiling.  This fucking dumb white wicker bed.  This stupid house.  Bed and breakfast?  That was a house.  How was the gig? 
[00:47:30]  That's a bed and breakfast.  Gig sucked.  It was that Carly Simon's hot tin roof.  It was fucking awful.  How was the sex?  Really?  I didn't fuck her.  I liked her.  I'm not fucking a girl I like at that point.  So wait, did Kevin do well and you didn't do well on stage?  No, I did fine.  Everybody did fine.  It was, you know.  It wasn't about that.  I'm sure Bobby did fine.  It was off the stage time.  It was just this fucking annoyance of being, I was pretending to be a couple. 
[00:48:00]  And I wasn't.  I wasn't a couple.  I wasn't even in that fucking mode.  And I was, you know, she wanted to do all this.  Like, do you want to go to dinner?  We can, no.  Let's just get a fucking pizza.  I just want to do my show.  That's all I want.  You know, when you first had a comedy, it was just about doing shows.  I would drive two hours to do five minutes at a fucking 99s.  Why would you invite her then?  I fucked up.  It was like one of those things where you're like, maybe I should.  So as you realized you invited her, it was the wrong thing to do, right?  No, no, no.  As soon as I was on that dumb ferry, you went, fuck, this is going to be a long weekend. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Because this is exactly what I don't want to be doing.  So then on the way back, the ham sandwich.  On the way back.  Now it makes sense.  That's why I had to slow you down.  Right.  On the way back, it was a shit weekend.  I fucking had just a shit time.  And she comes back with ham and cheese.  And I just said, why did you get me ham and cheese?  Why didn't you?  She goes, well, that's all they had.  I go, well, they didn't have anything else.  And she's like, well, they had this and that.  I go, couldn't you come back up and just ask me what I want?  And there's people, family.  There's everywhere.  Ask me if I wanted something different. 
[00:49:00]  This is what, this is the essence of women.  She just stood there and took it.  She took it.  She let me build up and build up to where the point where I was going, I just fucking  wanted an egg sandwich.  That's all I fucking wanted.  Okay.  That's all I wanted.  I'm fucking, I'm grinding through my teeth and you get me a fucking ham and cheese and  I'm going on and on.  And she let me go and go.  And then she finally just screamed, it's a fucking sandwich.  And everybody looked.  Like, yeah, it's a sandwich, dude.  I'm like, that's the fucking point. 
[00:49:30]  It's not about the sandwich.  You know?  And I was like, you fuck.  You, that's fucking illegal.  You fucking twat.  I was, I wasn't screaming.  I was grinding through my teeth.  Right.  And she said, she started crying.  Everybody looked at me like you're an asshole.  But if they heard the story from the beginning to where you heard it.  I just did.  And I, and I think you're an asshole.  Wow.  I side with her.  You think I'm an asshole at my, I just heard the story.  My baby's funeral. 
[00:50:00]  You'd be like, you're a dick.  I, I side with her on this one.  Yeah.  I know his wife though.  You fucked up.  No.  How long were you, how long were you guys dating at this point?  Fucking, it was, it was, uh, we were dating.  We, this was at a weird point though.  We dated.  Then I met this really hot 18 year old that, oh, and I dumped her.  You dumped an 18 year old?  No, I dumped my wife now.  All right.  I was dating my wife for like three months.  And then I met this hot 18 year old over my friend's house one night. 
[00:50:30]  She was staying with him, sleeping there.  And I fucking, we wound up hooking up like holding hands under a blanket.  Yeah, I was fucking gay, but she was probably one of the hottest chicks I've ever seen in  my life.  How old were you?  I had to be like 20, 22, 20, no, 24, 25, 25.  And she, uh, she was smoke.  She was 18 year old chick.  Nice.  Yeah.  I mean, incredible, incredible, an 11, honest to God.  And, uh, I called Dawn up the next day and said, yeah, gone. 
[00:51:00]  I, I gave my wife now the boot and not even like cheat on her, not even cheat.  I was like, you're done.  I was like, it's done.  I'm not even going to go through.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  Right.  This chick is so smoking.  If I can make this work, I want to make it work.  I'm cleaning the slate.  Fucking.  I call her up.  Boom.  Listen, it's not going to work.  She started crying.  So of course the 18 year old fucking realized what the fuck she was doing. 
[00:51:30]  Like, you know, a month in what a needy fucking soon to be fat.  So I was going to be.  And she, she dumped me.  She dumped you.  What'd she dump you for?  Like another, like an 18 year old guy.  But she was, she was actually dating a guy in his thirties who owned a Corvette dealership.  Jesus.  So this guy was before me.  So she was, I was the, let me try dating just a fucking normal dude.  Broke idiot.  Yeah.  Like that, that fucking, just a normal guy.  I was the normal guy. 
[00:52:00]  And, um, so as soon as she figured out that normal, like guys like me, it just, she was  absolutely right.  They suck.  Yeah.  Cause I couldn't even, I, that was when I first started comedy.  I was living in a shitty apartment with other comedians.  I had no money.  I couldn't even take her out.  But, you know, this guy was fucking balling.  He had Corvettes, a different one every day.  He was that Italian guy from Revere.  So, so what happened to her?  She fucking was supposed to, I was fucking sick one day, like deathly fucking ill.  And she called me up. 
[00:52:30]  She's, I was like, oh, I'm sick.  You know, and I wanted her to do what Dawn did.  Cause if I was sick with Dawn, Dawn would come over with fucking everything.  Homemade chicken soup.  Oh, she would.  Oh, she'd make homemade crackers.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  She'd fucking take care of me, be there all day.  This girl was like.  Push it to her bosom.  Yeah.  Like we were saying earlier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She, exactly.  And she, you know, she did all the stuff you wanted.  Exactly.  And the 18 year old girl's like, well, she goes, maybe I'll stop by later.  I was like, I was like, okay. 
[00:53:00]  That's exactly what an 18 year old girl should say to you.  She goes, is there any, I go, is there any way you can bring me some like soup or something?  She's like, yeah, I'll see what I can do.  And I was like, okay.  I think she showed up with an open box of wheat thins.  She brought from my house.  Horrible.  Would you have a sore throat?  She popped in for two seconds.  She looked amazing.  She wouldn't kiss me either.  She goes, yeah, you're sick.  I don't want to get sick.  So she, I think she shook my hand and I never saw her again.  That was it.  That was it.  She fucking saw me just sick when I wasn't strong and was like, yeah, I'm all fucking done 
[00:53:30]  with this.  Can we Facebook this girl?  I want to see what she looks like.  I would, I would love to.  I just, I, for the life of me, can't remember the name.  Can't remember her name.  I would love to know what she looks like now.  Yeah, I'm curious too.  So then you, you, you raced back to Dawn.  I hope she's fat and a mess.  She probably is.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Well, no, me and Dawn.  I find the ones that, uh, you know, do you wrong and they end up becoming slobs.  Yeah.  It's the best feeling ever.  I've looked up a few.  I have too.  And they're now just slobs. 
[00:54:00]  It's fucking, doesn't it make you feel wonderful?  Oh, fuck yeah.  But they probably looked me up and said the same thing.  But, uh, so then you moved back to Dawn.  So you were, you were newly dating for the second time when the, we didn't, this is the weird  thing about me and Dawn.  She eased back into my life as that friend.  Like she started just hanging out.  Like we started hanging out and cause we could get along.  I mean, they did a study.  There's no such thing as love.  Love doesn't exist.  You don't love a woman and stay together. 
[00:54:30]  The only reason why people stay together forever married is compatibility.  That's it.  They were just compatible.  So when you're with somebody that you can be with for the rest of your life, you're just  compatible.  Me and my wife are compatible.  I can be with her for long periods of time and not get sick of her.  And you know what I mean?  And she's, she's pretty.  And that's all you should ask for.  That's all you're going to get.  That's all you're going to get.  You shouldn't hope for more.  You're not going to fall.  You're going to get the, the, the, the passion, the sex, all that shit's going to fizzle and 
[00:55:00]  get better and get worse and get fucked up.  It's not going to, it's not going to get better as you fucking, oh my God, we've been in love  for fucking 50 years.  Go fuck yourself.  My grandmother and grandfather, she slept in a, like a closet room for the last 20 years  of their marriage.  Why?  Because he didn't want her in the bed.  Because he wanted all the space, right?  Yeah.  Well, he was a little man.  She was kind of a hefty woman.  Oh, really? 
[00:55:30]  Fuck.  So she slept in a twin bed in a fucking side room.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  But they loved each other.  They, I mean, 60 years of marriage.  She loved him to death, took care of him.  He took care.  It's just, you know, you're compatible.  Right.  You know, it's not this fucking Harlequin horse shit.  You're not going to get that.  Right.  It doesn't exist.  Well, going back to women, you know, because they're used to it, you've got to see this  video.  It's on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony now.  I think they just put it up there.  The golden age of broad smack. 
[00:56:00]  It's more of a visual.  But sometime today, go to the Facebook page and check it out for yourself.  Ronald Reagan featured in this clip as well.  Um.  Do it again.  I like it.  Do it again.  I am a woman.  Hear me roll.  Just punching.  Getting smacked.  I like it here. 
[00:56:30]  Well, I could change that in a hurry.  Ronald Reagan.  Bam.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Backhand smacks.  Punched her with a left.  Oh, whipping her.  Whipping this girl.  Pacino.  Pacino, yeah, the big fucking left hand on him.  Oh, there's some great slaps.  He gave her two, three.  That's Steve McQueen, four.  And now McGraw, right? 
[00:57:00]  Fucking Allie McGraw is harsh.  Six.  Stupid.  Fucking Kirk Douglas.  Harvey Korman from Blazing Saddles.  Spankings going on.  Oh, he woke her up.  The famous great foot scene we've talked about.  Come down, I'll get back to your seat.  I'll take care of it.  Leslie Nielsen in an airplane. 
[00:57:30]  Everything's just all right.  Oh, these are great slaps.  And a left punch.  He goes down.  Sean Connery.  Oh.  John Wayne gives this guy a fucking...  A brush to slap her with.  Yeah.  I find I would be proud of you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  John Wayne spanking a bitch. 
[00:58:00]  Nicholson in Chinatown.  I want the truth.  Or is it the post badge?  I think it's Chinatown.  He's slapping Faye Gunaway a lot.  Yeah.  I said I want the truth.  And then it's closer into a wall.  Yeah.  Nice hiney.  Yeah.  Is that Brando?  No.  No.  It's the guy from Walking Tall.  Oh.  But look how much I gain.  If I have to.  I can face anything. 
[00:58:30]  I can face anything.  He just slapped her.  I am strong.  Strong.  I am invincible.  Invincible.  I am one of mine.  Great.  Obviously a visual.  So go to our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  But isn't that amazing?  That was completely accepted in mainstream movies.  And you certainly don't see that anymore.  You shouldn't.  They missed the raging bull clip.  There's a couple of good Vicky slaps in there.  They were on to something. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, as men, we evolved to where it was like, you're going to slap these bitches to get them to fucking.  I mean, honestly.  Don't know how funny that sounds in the year 2011.  I understand.  Like, we learned.  Like, if you said that 50 years ago, no one would be laughing.  They're like, yeah, of course we have to.  I mean, they went through the same shit we're going through now.  But they were able to get it out with a slap.  Before they started slapping these chicks, they went through it too.  We've been going through this forever.  But these guys figured out, you slap them in the face and they start talking the way they should be talking. 
[00:59:30]  That's an amazing video.  God, I wish that was acceptable.  Yeah, well, I literally, I almost feel a glow at the prospect of slapping a girlfriend's face.  Like, how wonderful would that feel?  I would feel happy if I could just make her flinch.  Why don't we bring it back today?  You know what I mean?  Let's start the movement, guys.  I would love it.  Let's start the movement.  I want to just make my wife flinch.  Like, bring my hand back.  Yeah, I ought to.  And just make her cower and shake.  Jesus. 
[01:00:00]  That would make me feel good.  We got Twitter.  We could get the movement back.  Yeah.  We could start the movement.  Three assholes have decided to start slapping broads again.  That would be fucking great.  I just wish that was in the arsenal.  Just see Bill Clinton just slap Hillary right in the face during his speech.  Well, Reagan.  How about Reagan?  That might have been the best slap in the whole life.  She's like, I'm happy to be here.  And he's like, what did he say?  Like, I'll fix that or I'll...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he leapt across the room and slapped her.  I like the actual mush the best. 
[01:00:30]  The face mush.  The grapefruit?  Yeah, that's what they call it.  Jimmy Cagney.  Yeah.  James Cagney.  Yeah, when you just push their face and you push them down to the ground.  The grapefruit scene is one of the best ones ever.  Oh, man.  All right.  Why don't we do our first break?  So Bob Kelly's in studio, obviously.  Otto and George coming in today.  Nice.  Yes.  And Jason Ellis stopping by to say hi.  Are you promoting anything, Bobby?  I'm actually in Atlanta this weekend for the comedy festival.  Is there a festival at Atlanta?  Yeah.  Comedy festival.  Well, you know, they're doing comedy festival. 
[01:01:00]  Wait, where?  Atlanta at...  Is it part of the Masters?  Masters this weekend.  Are you close to Austin?  No, it's...  I mean, not Austin.  Augusta.  Augusta, excuse me.  No.  No.  No, it's downtown Atlanta.  It's a comedy.  It's a small comedy festival.  Me and Gary Goleman are actually just doing Friday, Saturday night, one show, small theaters.  How's Gary?  Speaking of anger.  He's doing good, man.  He's renting his...  You know, he goes...  Gary's got the best anger.  Oh, yeah.  He does?  Oh, dude.  Goleman's anger?  Are you fucking nuts?  I wouldn't fuck with that guy.  Me and Gary... 
[01:01:30]  I wouldn't fuck with that guy.  Me and Gary went at it a couple times.  I can see that.  And his anger is like my anger.  We fought in Cabo in a jacuzzi because I called him a liberal fuck.  It was a real fight.  Ah, not like fist fight, but right in each other's faces in a jacuzzi.  He's a daunting motherfucker when he stands up.  We were both sitting down, so the argument...  I made it easy when you're sitting down.  I was like, fuck you.  He's like...  Yeah.  He stood up.  Fuck you!  Six-four, right?  I had to get right in the middle of his chest plate with my face. 
[01:02:00]  He's a daunting motherfucker.  You're lucky he didn't slug you.  Dude, he...  Well...  He's a...  Goleman's a big dude, man.  Goleman's a big guy, but he's got...  He's got really great, crazy anger, but he's got one of the biggest hearts.  So as soon as he does something, he feels immediately bad.  He's a really nice guy.  So as soon as he starts yelling, he'll be like, you know what?  I'm sorry.  I fucked up.  Because he doesn't want to be that guy, but...  Right.  He's not a bully?  No.  He's...  But audience members, dude, he's choked people out.  He's fucking gone right into the crowd.  I love that about him.  He's notorious. 
[01:02:30]  But again, if you're in the audience and you see a fucking monster of his size, a 6'4 guy who  obviously played football.  And you're dumb enough to fucking heckle him, then he should handle you like that.  Oh, yeah.  That just pleases me.  Absolutely.  He did the funniest thing when we were doing tour guys.  And he got so mad one night at the crowd because they were booing him.  He can't...  He couldn't...  He had nobody to hit or anything to blame.  He ran out in the parking lot and just dug his hand in his pocket and grabbed all his  change and just threw it in an empty parking lot.  I was fucking dying. 
[01:03:00]  He was like, why?  And you're ting, ting, ting, ting.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to break.  When we get back, we should have played it here, but we went way too long.  Meatloaf freaking out.  Oh, I heard about that, yeah.  We finally got the clips of Meatloaf from The Apprentice, Celebrity Apprentice.  You know who's becoming my pal is good old Donnie Trump.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We're going back and forth on the Twitter.  Nice guy.  We got to have him back.  Donald Trump Jr.  I can't fucking...  I want to text famous people, but I get shit from you dumb fans. 
[01:03:30]  Well, I was doing someone a favor, but then it turned out to be a little back and forth  with me and Donnie Trump.  Just shooting the shit about The Apprentice and other things.  Are you DMing or you...  DMing.  Oh, yeah.  With little Donnie Trump Jr.  He follows you.  Yeah, he does.  That's great.  Well, that's...  I could get him to follow you.  That was the whole thing with somebody else.  Somebody wanted Donnie to follow them.  That's pretty famous.  So I said, all right, I could try to hook you two up.  I don't want him, but I do want a couple people that if you can get...  I'll give you a list.  I don't have a lot of famous people following me. 
[01:04:00]  I have none.  None.  Belladonna?  Huh?  Belladonna?  Belladonna, yeah, but she's a...  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, her and her husband are friends.  Yeah, they are.  How do you find out if a famous person is following you?  The only way I can...  We got the regulars.  Kevin Smith, Joe Rogan.  You go to their profile and it says, is following you or is not following you?  Dana White.  I got to follow you.  Dana's not following me.  But you know what you can do?  Go into your email.  I got to figure it out.  Whatever email is assigned your Twitter account and then just search their name.  I've never done that. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, but I want to know about celebrities I wouldn't even think about that might be following me.  Oh, I don't know.  Like, boy George out of nowhere started following me.  Out of nowhere?  I don't know if he still is, but I don't even know how he got where he decided he needed to follow me,  but it must have been something gay that I fucking tweeted.  I don't know.  I saw that video you did with the dumb apple.  It was fucking...  Did you see that video?  Oh, yeah, thanks.  It's so simple, but...  It's a very short video.  It's a video.  He's at the John Lennon thing where everybody's kumbaya. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he takes the apple off the ground, shows it to the camera.  The apple comes down, pans around all these fucking hippies.  The apple comes back up and there's just a bite taken out of it, and then he puts it back down in the shrine.  I went to the Imagine Shrine, yeah.  Yeah.  It was the 30th anniversary, I guess.  So there was thousands of people there, and I ended up literally on the mosaic because I got there early and squeezed my way in.  And just watched the hippies sing for two and a half hours.  Part of me really enjoyed it.  That's the twisted part of the whole thing. 
[01:05:30]  I wouldn't know.  I fucking hate the Beatles.  You hate the Beatles?  You don't hate the Beatles.  I do.  I hate the Beatles.  I was playing Beatles where you liked them.  You know what?  I know we have to break, but we were talking...  Jay Moore was in yesterday.  We were doing the top five Beatles songs, top five Rolling Stones songs, and we were having a good time with it.  Then I checked my Twitter after the show.  So many people trying to say they hate the Beatles, and I'm so glad you said that.  No one hates the Beatles.  You don't hate the Beatles.  You might not like...  You might not...  How do I explain this?  You may not love them, but you don't hate them either. 
[01:06:00]  You don't hate the Beatles.  It started with the Beatles.  So if you like music in general...  It didn't start with the Beatles.  It started with black people.  No, no, no.  The Beatles changed the way...  The Beatles changed everything.  They really did.  They changed everything.  Simple as that.  They changed everything.  What about Elvis?  And the Beatles...  Elvis changed everything.  They're a group, though.  Meaning, in a group form...  Lemmy was explaining it to me one time.  I interviewed him, and I asked him about the Beatles, and he said they were the first  four guys to harmonize.  They played their own instruments.  He was explaining what they meant to him and why they changed the instruments.  When you get guys like... 
[01:06:30]  You said Lemmy, right?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I was thinking about...  All right.  So you get guys like Lemmy and Ozzy saying...  And Brian Johnson's racing DC and Halford.  And Brian Johnson saying how much...  Halford, even?  All of them.  When you get these guys saying how much the Beatles influenced them, you gotta realize  how powerful this fucking band was.  When Ozzy said, oh my god, I grew up listening to the Beatles, they're the greatest thing  ever.  I'm like, Ozzy thinking that?  He was supposed to be the rebel thinking completely out of the box different.  Yeah, but you...  And even the comics over in fucking England now, it's a fucking Eddie Izzard is the fucking... 
[01:07:00]  Oh my god, he started it all.  Who gives a fuck?  Eddie Izzard and the Beatles?  Yeah.  Exactly.  What are you talking about?  I don't know, dude.  I'm trying to just...  But the Beatles are...  All I'm saying is, my point is, when people say on Twitter, I hate the Beatles, I don't  really believe that.  You don't hate them.  I can listen to them.  It's not one of your favorite bands and all that, and you're not searching out their music,  but trust me, I don't think anyone really hates the Beatles.  Nothing fucking makes me more sick than being at the gym when I do go, before the jokes  hit, and a Beatles song comes on.  It's just like, fuck. 
[01:07:30]  Why?  Because it fucking just sucks.  Like what Beatles song?  Any of them.  You don't like Let It Be?  No, no.  Maybe not at the gym, I wouldn't want to hear that, but...  I mean, when would you want to hear that?  Let It Be?  Driving upstate New York with the window down and your dog's head out the window?  Let It Be?  Fuck off.  No, I don't want to hear that.  It's a great tune.  It's good.  No, it's not good.  It's not great.  Um, in my life, you don't like these, or fucking, a day in the life, whatever, pick  your Beatles song.  No.  That can't be, Danny. 
[01:08:00]  What?  Danny just wrote, we must be in some cycle.  We actually did a Bob Hates the Beatles bit one year ago today, oh, tomorrow.  I don't remember ever talking to Bob Kelly about hating the Beatles.  Can I ask you a question, too?  I've talked about it.  Who the fuck, whoever should, who did remember that, should be slapped in the face.  We've got archives.  We've been around long enough, and we've got archives now.  Who looks up an archive?  That's what we do now.  Really?  Yeah.  This day in opening Anthony history, it's very important to people.  Bob's just looking at his iPad. 
[01:08:30]  It's time to take a break.  I don't, I don't believe people really hate the Beatles.  You can't, how can you not, like, well, let's see.  Not to the point of, uh, of the amount of tweets I read yesterday.  Sure, there's probably a couple guys.  Okay, I'll, I'll, I'll admit that.  But in general, people don't hate the Beatles.  I found an iPod with every Beatles song ever made on it.  It went on my iPhone, and my, and I erased it all.  I deleted them all.  What, what's wrong with you?  I deleted them all.  What did the Beatles ever do to you?  I, they did something to you.  I hate his dumb bass.  Were you molested to the Beatles when you were a little kid? 
[01:09:00]  Whatever violin bass he uses.  Whatever that Paul McCartney guitar, I hate it.  Who was the guy you hated growing up?  Billy Magicdon.  Billy, was he a big Beatles fan while he's slapping you around the house?  What happened to you?  To let it be?  Right.  It's probably something sick like that.  All right, well, more with Bob Kelly and Jim Norton and Otto and George.  You got something for break, E-Rock, or you want me to play the FU line? 
[01:09:30]  We're not going to play the Beatles out, are we?  How much longer?  All right, fuck it.  We'll be back.  Just turn it up.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. 
[01:10:00]  Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me 
[01:10:30]  Shine until tomorrow, let it be  I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me  Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  There will be an answer, let it be, yeah, let it be 
[01:11:00]  Let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  Whisper words of wisdom, let it be, yeah  The virus, get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:11:30]  866-WOW-1-WOW  Send your feedback to feedback at Opie and Anthony  Bobby, got Bob Kelly today  And a bunch of people on Twitter checking that for the first time today  Sign me up for the slapping broads movement  That's from two nouns on Twitter  Should we try to get that going today?  They would fucking crucify us 
[01:12:00]  And then Bobby said, during the break, I said, save it  Because this is very interesting  He said, you would just ask Paul McCartney for a cigarette  That's how much it would mean to you  If you just saw him on the street, you'd be like, hey buddy, you got a cigarette  You wouldn't care that it's Paul McCartney  And you would be way more nervous to meet George St. Pierre  I'd be more nervous  Are you just doing this for the radio?  No, I would be more nervous meeting like George St. Pierre  Than Paul McCartney 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, I'd walk up to Paul  Dude, listen, can you do me a favor and hold this?  Paul McCartney's got to be the most famous person in the world  Him, Muhammad Ali  No desire to meet him  Lady Gaga  Lady Gaga even only after two years?  Maybe not on that level  But she's fucking  No, she's obviously massively famous  But I guess you have to have longevity in there too  So what's the short list of really famous people?  That had longevity  Madonna  So you got, let's do this real fast  Paul McCartney, Muhammad Ali 
[01:13:00]  Another list, Jimmy  We love lists  We love lists  We're the list-making kids  I think we need  Mike Tyson  I think we need Anthony back  Because we're doing lists every day  Mike Tyson is an extraordinarily famous guy  Mike Tyson  Everywhere in the world  Bono, yeah  Bono  Mick Jagger  Mick Jagger  Keith Richards you got to throw in there  Chip Chipperson  Chip fucking Chipperson sucks a dick  No, I don't  I'm a private detective dick  It's the awkward look after 
[01:13:30]  Is what fucking kills me  True  Hold on, we got Jay Moores checking in  Jay Moores  Hiya boys  We're making another list  It figures you call just as we're making another list  Listen to me very closely, Jay Moores  Okay  We're looking for a list of the most famous people in the world  Now, they have to have obviously the fame thing  But also longevity  So you don't throw a Lady Gaga in this list  So we're talking Muhammad Ali, Paul McCartney  Hey, you got to look 
[01:14:00]  Am I making my list?  Are you going to tell me who's on my list?  Alright, that's fair enough  I got Oprah  Muhammad Ali  Jordan  Jordan  Fuck  Forgot about Jordan  Oh, his airness  Do you see his new Hitler mustache in those commercials?  We love it  Yeah, we've been talking about the Hitler mustache for a while now  What's a better look for the black man?  The Hitler mustache  Or the bald Shaquille O'Neal with only sideburns  Which is really strange, too  He looks like Muttley from the cartoon  But is Jordan as famous in, like, Africa 
[01:14:30]  And other places where the NBA hasn't played?  Those are his people, Jimmy  That's true  Yeah, no, Jordan is massively fucking famous  Jimmy, I'm going to pick you up by your ankles  And smash your head against the stick  I can't laugh because I'm coughing  It makes me cough  Who else is on that list there, Jay Moores?  I'm going to say Tom Cruise  And maybe Eddie Murphy  It's going to be a musician  I'm going to say Eddie Murphy  But I'm going to switch him out for a musician  Bono?  Bono, Paul McCartney  I'm going to say Paul  Yeah, you got to  Well, fucking Bob Kelly's in studio today 
[01:15:00]  He said that Paul McCartney means nothing  Dude, dude  The monkeys were better than the Beatles, dude  Paul McCartney means so little to him  That he would just ask him for a cigarette on the street  And not even fucking think twice about it  Bobby, Bobby, you don't mean that  I swear, I would have no problem  He would not make me nervous to walk up to that fucking tea-sipping douchebag  And he hates the Beatles, too  I don't hate the Beatles  I just don't like them  I don't want them  When I got home yesterday, she goes, how'd it go?  I said, good, we made lists 
[01:15:30]  And then a caller called in and said I was a list bully  And my wife goes, you are a list bully  You start yelling at people that their list is wrong  And I always have to remind you, honey, this is their list  And you know we turned Victor around  Really, as tears go by  Jesus, Jimmy  I like that as tears go by  And by the way  You're wrong  Jimmy's got a mouthful of food  That's why I'm defending Jimmy's tune  And I'm also defending Ruby Tuesday  Because fucking Keith Richards made a list in 1990  Someone tweeted me  And put Ruby fucking Tuesday on his list 
[01:16:00]  Ruby Tuesday  You don't like the Stones either?  Fucking, they stink  No, they don't  He only likes the dropkick Murphys  Because they're wicked rich at it  And they don't want to shout out to fucking God  I fucking hate them, too  I don't like them  What do you like, besides prostitutes?  What's your band, Bobby?  I can let you listen to it, actually  How about you just tell us?  Oh, that's good radio, Robert  How about you just tell us?  I actually like, um  What's your band?  I like Zeppelin  I like Halen  I like ACDC  Did he say Halen? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, Halen  What a fucking zilch  ACDC, I'm a fucking zilch  Led Zeppelin  Were you listening to us last week, Bobby, at all?  No, you were zilch  Because you said Halen  I'm a big, only fans of Halen  Say Halen  Hold on a minute, though  Let's look  Jimmy, you hate  You know what, Bobby?  That's okay  Because I'm a big DC fan  AC  I got it  I got it  I wasn't sure  I was trying to think of something funny to say  Oh, okay  I wasn't sure  I just had nothing  You had a blank in your face  I thought I had to help you  Yeah, me and you were just blankly staring at each other 
[01:17:00]  No, because I'm like, fucking say something  I got it  What's your favorite Van Halen song?  And were you listening last week, Bob Kelly?  Because we did a whole hour on this  Did you see the thing I sent Jimmy on Twitter?  David Lee Roth  Singing Van Halen songs  But, like, fucking  Bluegrass  We did it  Without the rest of the band, you mean?  Isolated vocals?  No, he's on fucking  Wait, what?  He's talking about that Bluegrass album he put out like four years ago  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  No, he was on Letterman, or one of those shows  Actually doing Van Halen songs  Bluegrass style  Bluegrass style  It was the fucking most disturbing thing I've ever seen 
[01:17:30]  They all get bored after a while  Don't have to fucking make their songs different  Does Robert Kelly still have Andy Pettit lips?  I do, I do have pillow lips  He's got those fucking wet, glistening Dan Natterman lips  They're not that sexy  Natterman's lips are very creepy  Well, you know, you have creepy lips  Andy Pettit lips  Wow, that's great  Natterman is a creepy dude, man  I must kill Bobby to know he's got lips like a Yankee  All right, so we made our list 
[01:18:00]  We made another list today  Oprah, Ali, Jordan, Tom Cruise, Paul McCartney  That would be your  I think so  Yeah  I think so  I wouldn't put Jordan on that list  Even though I know he's very, very famous  Really?  You know what?  If I switch him out  Then I gotta put  Maybe David Beckham  Ooh, that's a good one  He's a soccer player  And soccer players are bigger around the world than NBA players  Yeah  Dude, you know I got Halen 
[01:18:30]  DC  Halen  Metallica  Yeah, Metallica  What's your favorite Van Halen song?  I asked you  Unchained  Pretty well  Were you listening to this last week?  No  He said Unchained first  Panama is the fucking shit  But he can't  Then don't talk to Eddie  Don't talk to Eddie Trunk then  Eddie Trunk left Unchained off his playlist of  We're obsessed with this  Well, you know what?  Bobby has a fair point though  He didn't really make it  But I'll make it for him  Because I know he's sleepy  But like  Why is it okay to say Zeppelin 
[01:19:00]  Floyd  And Maiden  But you can't say Halen?  We don't know why  But it is  You can say Sabbath too  We got Eddie Trunk's book in  In the office  Is Otto there?  I'll just not hear you  But listen  I want to go to the Black Sabbath list  From Eddie Trunk's book  Because now we got Jimmy back  Because Jimmy wasn't here last week  When we were beating up Eddie  I want to see if you agree  With Eddie's Black Sabbath list  We only had  I won't  Two copies  We don't have a copy of Eddie's book around? 
[01:19:30]  I'll go check  Okay, alright  What would your top five Black Sabbath songs be, Jimmy?  Jimmy?  I don't know  Don't be too cool for the room  I hate when people do that  No, but I won't be  My favorite songs  I can only list my favorites  Alright  And they're not going to be anybody else's favorites  But these are the ones I like the most  I'd like to hear about it, potheads  Let me think  It's fucking tough, dude  Shit  Alright, think for a second  Jay  Jesus Christ 
[01:20:00]  It's like the fucking PSAT  No, they're gonna  Jimmy takes his list making very seriously  He fucking  He's like an Asian student all of a sudden  He pulled out his Rolling Stone list out of his ass yesterday  When me and you were thinking about it all night  And then Jimmy was right there  Yeah  He might have had the best list  In high school I was voted  Boy, most likely to make a list quickly  I think we should make the top five lists  I couldn't agree more  Jay, did you watch the game last night?  No, I was at the Rangers game  And I had no idea how fucking drunk people get at hockey games 
[01:20:30]  That shit was like  I mean, I was expecting to see Jody Foster on a fucking pinball machine  They get a little wild at the garden  Oh, my  Like, I go  Don't worry, I'll get up  I'll go get the Coke Zeroes  Yeah  What a fucking  That turned out real good  Nothing like drunk people  And no anonymity  Well, it's all Wall Street guys  That have been drinking since  No  Whatever  These were like  Everybody kind of looked like a relative of Kevin Smith  Oh, okay  They're all  They all got their jerseys on  Yeah, very suburban  By that  By that, by the way  I meant very suburban 
[01:21:00]  Uh-huh  Just very  Salt of the earth  And lots of girls  But like girls  That'll fucking fight in two seconds  If you fucking look at me crooked  You scumbag  Uh-huh  And the Rangers played like  Complete fucking assholes  And then  We left  And then they scored fucking four goals  In the third quarter  Oh, wow  Wow  Are they going to make the playoffs?  I don't even know  You know, Travis?  Yeah, they're going to make it  They'll be the eighth seed  They're right there, right?  Right on the bubble?  They're on the bubble  But are they going to make it now? 
[01:21:30]  Fuck  That guy in the Bruins  Had 40 stitches in his face last week  And he's listed last night  It's questionable  You know what?  Give the night  You know what?  You know what?  When are you giving the night off?  You know, you brought up yesterday  But if I had 40 stitches in my face  I wouldn't be in here doing radio even  But these guys are thinking of going back on the ice  If we had a fight, we wouldn't be in the radio  Right  Unless the whole show was about  Like, go to the fucking fight  Can you believe that shit?  Right  Oh yeah, I forgot we talked about that  Right  40 fucking stitches  Because that's the thing with the show  They always repeat themselves  You have to 
[01:22:00]  We have to fill this time up  Any way we can  Did that fucking Guinea call yet  From his stupid cruise ship  With a bunch of fat people from Wisconsin?  Well, he tweeted finally yesterday  So we're hoping he does the right thing  And calls us from his satellite phone  He was swimming with dolphins  And the quote was  I raped the casino last night  So Anthony doing well on his vacation so far  Anthony strikes me as a guy that would completely mock  Swimming with dolphins  He tweeted like he had a good time 
[01:22:30]  I think you become what you hate  Yeah  He was just trying to figure out a way to attach a gun  To the top of a dolphin  I swam with the dolphins  It's the biggest crock of shit ever  They don't know what the fuck you are  They don't give a fuck about you  They just care about the trainer  And the stupid fish he's waving above your head  And you think you're having an interaction  With the dumb fucking fish  First of all, dolphins are fucking highly intelligent  They're not where I went  Bobby, how do you feel?  What's your stance on dolphins?  I think they're highly intelligent  Not where I went  All he gave a shit was about the stupid fish the trainer had 
[01:23:00]  And also like, wow, it's fucking waving at me  No, it's not  It wants the fish behind  Wait, but the dolphins  What about the jets in the 49ers?  It's a fucking ship  You're incorrigible  Bobby, have you ever swam with dolphins?  Yes, I have, sir  And tell us about it  It's the most amazing thing ever  Why?  What'd you get to do with that?  That was like Superman  Flying out of the water  With two dolphins  Yeah, because it was going back to the dock  For another fucking fish  It's all about the fish  Might have been three dolphins  Where? 
[01:23:30]  On your  Your belly  The bottom of your foot  Yeah, and they push on the bottom  Yeah  That's fucking crazy  It was amazing for Bobby  Because it was at Revere Beach  The dolphins were smoking  I want the wild dolphins  That fucking hump your ass  Just jump in with them  I don't want the trainers around  Oh, but you swam with dolphins?  Yeah, I hated it  Because it was such a good  You are a cynical prick  No, it was a crock  Hey, Bobby, I was talking about my priest yesterday  That's a crock of shit  I was talking about my priest, Bobby, yesterday  Yeah? 
[01:24:00]  Like, this new  He's 32  And he's, like, super cool  And, like, we go boxing  Like, Krav Maga  And we run together  And they're like  Let's call him up  And ask him if you've ever seen  A good fucking camel toe  I was like  Oh, my God  See, Bobby understands that, though, Jay  Of course he does  You're not going to turn him  All we're saying is  Hold on  What kind of priest is this?  He hangs out with his young priest  That has turned him back into the church  Which, that's fine  I have no problem with that  But then he's friends with him enough  Where they box together  They go surfing together  They're hanging out on a beach  It's like the wire  So you think you would almost have a relationship 
[01:24:30]  Where you might ask him a few questions  You wouldn't ask the old priest in your church  That you've never seen outside the church  Wait, your priest boxes?  Who is he?  Damien Karras?  I used to have a priest  Nothing  I used to have a priest friend like that  I don't know it  Fuck  I used to have a priest  Anthony was here  He'd laugh  What was it, Jimmy?  That was the exorcist  Fuck  He was an athlete  Sorry  Someone out there got it, though, Jimmy  I had a priest friend  Just because we're stupid  Doesn't mean someone out there  Didn't enjoy that  We lose Jay on that one  That was really bad, Jimmy  Why? 
[01:25:00]  That's not a bad  No, it's not bad at all  I just was not talking for a minute  Everybody got nervous  So, Bobby  If you have a young priest  That you're kind of hanging with  Outside the church  Wouldn't you try to ask him some questions?  In a respectful way?  Yeah, but you can't ask him about a fucking camel toe  Between asking him in a respectful way  And then him listening to a replay  Knowing a minute before he got on the phone  Jimmy wants to know  If anybody ever fucked Mother Teresa's throat  Until she gagged  When she was younger  Yeah, not when she was a Mother Teresa  When she was Terry  Some guy  Some guy 
[01:25:30]  Somewhere  When he was younger  Probably said  Dude, I'm trying to fuck Terry  Will you talk to her?  Is that her name?  Terry?  Teresa, yeah  Terry  What do you think?  Terry  She was Terry at one point  Your priest will be teaching fucking Eskimos  The book of Matthew  In the North Pole after that  Yeah, no  I heard that someone's  I heard Terry's been fucking  I didn't hear that  I'm trying to fuck Terry  So maybe Jimmy  Give her a loaf of bread  Could have fucking smoothed it down a little bit  When I first got sober  I had a priest friend  And he actually  We were really good friends 
[01:26:00]  And we hung out  And did all that shit  And then I did my fourth step with him  And he kissed my neck  And uh  Oh my god  Fucking leaned in  And fuck  I'm not talking  I'm not talking peck  I'm talking  Opened his mouth  And closed it on my neck  What'd you do?  I fucking  Sucked his cock off  Yeah  Fucking blew that  And I made the sign of the cross  With his jizz  Jesus Bobby  I fucking  I never talked to the guy again 
[01:26:30]  What am I gonna do?  And I just did my fourth step  So it's like  Now I gotta do it all over again  Cause this fucking  Child molester  There's a rod  Yeah but those fucking  Annie Pettit lips  You know  It's hard to fight those  You really are delicious  It's like  Bobby the child  With those big fake juicy lips  You're almost  It's almost a communist act  To not molest him  What do you mean almost?  Yeah  Alright so we won't talk about  Jay Moore's young priest  That he hangs out with  The cool priest  It's a queen  He's great  It's a good church  I'm not gonna  Fucking falter for that 
[01:27:00]  Is it Catholic  Or is it  Catholic  Catholic  Catholic  Catholic  Catholic is trying to get  They're fucking actually  They have a  They're trying to get their shit together  No they're just being cooler  Than they were  You know  That's what I was saying  My grandmother watches  They have a TV network  Now in Boston  And they got these two priests  One's on a piano  The other one's singing  But it's not  It's not as goofy  I'll go see Billy Joel  Yeah but they're kinda stupid  And they make fun of themselves  They're trying to get their shit together  They're trying a little bit  That's what Jay was kinda  Talking about  More than any other religion  They're the ones making 
[01:27:30]  Most effort to be progressive  At my grandfather's funeral  I walked on stage  To give the eulogy  One of these things  This priest grabbed me  He goes  And kissed your neck  Like old times  He goes  Hey what's up  He goes  What's up  You're the comedian  Right  And I was like  Dude  What the fuck's wrong with you  Yeah  He was just  You know  He's a fucking cool guy  He actually made everybody laugh  That story went nowhere  Yeah what are you gonna do  Not all of them are winners  They take you in the back  You know  No  Want to molest me  No 
[01:28:00]  No one watches college basketball  But it was a really shitty effort  By Butler  One of the worst efforts ever  I wanted Butler to win  Just so they could take away  Other people's recruiting  Is that what happens  Yeah I guess that wouldn't happen  It's in Indiana  So you just like  Like Indiana  Hasn't been dog shit forever  Even with Bob Knight  It was like  Okay we get it  You're Indiana  Fucking you still suck  You what you won in 1984  Atta boy  Yeah  So I kind of wanted  Butler to win  But then I realized  Wait I don't give a shit 
[01:28:30]  I never got past  Fucking high school  Why do I give a shit  With these knuckle draggers  That didn't fucking  Earn their way into  A learning  Higher institution of learning  That's what really bothers me  Division one scholarships  You know it really grinds my gears  Division one scholarships  Really fucking make me  Batch  Like Kimba  Actually Kimba Walker  Is supposedly like  A real actually smart guy  But when you get like  Shaquille O'Neal  Had a full scholarship  From fucking LSU  And you read his tweets  And he can't spell the  Well he can 
[01:29:00]  Like my son  I'm gonna go in pocket  For 400 grand  For my son's fucking college  And this guy's going  Take that to the house  Well that's a black thing though  They like to spell D-A  On Twitter  Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  And they like to say  And they like to say  Though at the end of sentences  I know that  Really though  You hear me  You feel me  You feel me  They end all sentences  With though  You'll see it for yourself  On Twitter  My opening act  Tom  Do you know Tom Segura  Bobby  No  No  I don't know 
[01:29:30]  He played football  On Florida  In high school  And he said  Every time  One of the brothers  Would run  Like a four yard run  Like one yard  Four yard  Every time you tackle them  You would just have  A pile of guys  And you'd hear them  In the bottom of the pile  Go  You could charge that  To the game  They said  At every play  You can charge that  To the game  And I said  What does that mean  He goes  I don't know  Every play  And they would get up  And like flip the ball  On your face  And go  You could charge that  To the game right there  He was hoping  To make some money  On t-shirts  I think  You could charge that  To the game 
[01:30:00]  And if they got called  For a penalty  They'd go  I thought we were here  To play  What are you guys doing  I don't know  Bob showed me a video  Or something  Why would you show  Jimmy a video  In the middle of  A Jay Moore phone call  She was looking  At this thing  I wanted to show him  This video of me  Getting my nose hairs  Pulled out of my nose  You didn't care about  What Jay had to say  Is that what you're saying  I'm not  Is that what you're saying  Right now  I hate  First of all  When you talk sports  With a guy like Jay  Jay is a  No the reason  I brought this up  Jay is a fucking  Phenom stat  He knows everything  That's why I bring it up 
[01:30:30]  He doesn't like  College basketball  Which surprised me  Because he likes sports  I fucking hate college anything  Anything college  I fucking hate  College football  I fucking hate it  Maybe you could have  Hung into that conversation  The 60 seconds it warranted  I actually thought  You were fucking  Into the bullshit  It sounded like  You were into it  What would you like  To talk about Bobby  Because you don't want  Let's talk about how much  When I said  I hate college basketball  You were like  Well here goes Jay  On one of his rants again  I hate everything college  I hate college basketball  Jimmy where's your laptop 
[01:31:00]  Let's look some shit  Jay's gonna go on and on  With his love affair  With college basketball  I hate that fucking  Everybody in here  Is looking at their  Fucking iPads  I look at my shit  One time  And you call me out  No you were searching  You found  You got Jimmy's attention  Now Jimmy's looking  At your fucking iPhone  It was a whole thing  It was a whole thing  It wasn't a quick  Little thing  Looking down on the  Twitter thing  Dang  And then when you  Explain that you were  Looking up your nose  Hair is being clipped  Yeah really  Not being clipped  I really must be  The most boring man 
[01:31:30]  You're not Jay  I apologize  You blew him off  For a video  Of getting your  Fucking nose hair  Fucking clipped  First of all  First of all  No fuck you  You fucking scumbag  You fucking  Jay  I fucking  First of all  I love fucking Jay  Did you not find  The video of you  Getting your nose hairs  Clipped by  It's not being clipped  They're being waxed  It was of himself  They're being waxed  How do you wax  Your nose hairs  They put wax  In your nose 
[01:32:00]  Why don't you pull them out  And just clip them  With a scissor  No this is the best way  Fuck that  They put the wax  In your nose  They put a little  Popsicle stick up  Squeeze it  I'm never calling  The show again  Yeah I'm sorry  No you can call the show  I think Kelly ruined it  I hate you  I'm sorry  Does that fucking hurt  Let me deal with this  Wait now  You know I have  Bobby should be punished  Bobby should be punished  There you go  That was  We lost Jay on that too  I punished Bob  I showed him a picture  Of an open asshole  Bob was punished 
[01:32:30]  For his misbehavior  Is this fake  Because a lot of people  Why do you have that  A lot of people think  The reaction that you have  Is fake  Well fuck a lot of people  I don't think it's fake at all  But this is the fucking point  Does that hurt  Because when I pull  A nose hair out  If it's in  Like near the front  Especially  It'll make you fucking  Tear up  So if you got all your hair  Being fucking  Ripped out at one time  Being waxed  That's gotta suck  It's all in one  Ready  Look  Oh I hate that  So you look like a fighter 
[01:33:00]  That has to have his nose  Fucking plugged up  And then they rip that thing out  And all the hair  Goes with it huh  Oh fuck that  Look at all the hair  Is that on your  On your twitter  You shouldn't wax your nose  How you need it  You don't need  No you don't  I think you need it  Nose hair  It stops dirt  From going into your lungs  It's not a mistake  That it's there  Yeah you just want  To keep it trimmed  But I think you need  To keep the fucking  You don't wax your nose  Hair like it's a pussy  Jimmy's right  You need that  To keep dirt  Out of your fucking lung  That's what nose hair  Is for  It filters dirt 
[01:33:30]  You don't know  And it holds boogers  So you can eat them  Well what am I saying  I like a booger  Once in a while  Who feeds one of my dog  Me and Diva  Sit on the couch  On a Sunday  Eat some boogies  You like the one  Where it's hard  But then you pull it out  And it's got the  Attachment  It's almost like  A long neck clam  No a bungee cord  It's like  It's like gooey in the middle  You lost Jimmy on that one  I love it  And then you flop that  In your mouth  And chew on it  Alright let's relax now  Dip it in butter  We lost Jay Moore's 
[01:34:00]  Over that Bobby  I love Jay Moore  First of all  One of the funniest guys  Ever  Call in and guess  I was hoping  He's not listening  But maybe we could  Call him back  I wanted him to do  His Joe Buck again  Did you hear his Joe Buck  I did not  I like his Larry Merchant  He does Larry  But you gotta hear  His Joe Buck  Now that baseball season's here  If we can get him  Back on the line  Just to do that  I know that's like  Having him perform  Like a seal  But it's fucking  Really funny  He does the best  Colin Quinn ever  Yeah  I dropped Colin off 
[01:34:30]  Last night  After  It was just uneventful  How much did he cost  What do you mean  Oh  Oh can we talk about  The tranny after the break  Yeah  Because a lot of people  Are saying you were  Supposed to be the first  DJ caught with the tranny  A lot of people  Saying it Jimmy  I know they are  So maybe  It's very hurtful  Maybe you could  Explain what this guy  Did wrong  Some guy got caught  With a tranny  A DJ  A very famous DJ  A pretty famous guy  Well we'll have  The story next  Alright  Can we do that  And also the  Meatloaf freak out still 
[01:35:00]  Otto and George  On the way  Otto  And Sammy Hagar  Talking about  His alien thing  With Dr. Drew  And did we look  At the Jesse Ventura audio  Yeah Sam's looking  At it right now  Alright  Because he was on  Piers Morgan  Piers gave him  The business last night  Alright  Jimmy  Want to promote  Something real fast  Or  Just  Connecticut sold out  For antisocial  So I would say  This Friday  Saturday  Columbus at the  Funny Bone  It's my first time  In Columbus Ohio  Should be really  Uneventful  Okay 
[01:35:30]  That's a good club  I hope so  You'll like it  The guy who runs  It's a great guy  Jay didn't answer  No problem  We'll go to the  FU line  Sirius XM  The virus  Yeah  This is the  O.P.D. Anthony Show  We have lots going on  Otto and George  Signing in  Jesse Ventura's  In the building  By the way  Who cares  For sure he's saying  Something outrageous  He was on  Piers Morgan  Last night  Terrific  Piers gave him  The business  We'll have a couple  Cliffs  But Jesse  He was walking 
[01:36:00]  Around yesterday  Saying that  He's doing every  Show  It's serious  Except for one  Good  Don't  Who gives a fuck  Literally  Honestly he is  Absolutely mean  You want to do  The show  Great  You don't want to do  The show  Who cares  You can't handle  Being argued with  What a fucking  Baby  Yeah you were  You were  What a governor  You should be able  To  Take a little abuse  And be able to  Argue your point  I didn't make it  Personal  Yeah you did  And we got the tape 
[01:36:30]  You were the first  One to insult  And all you  Jesse fans out there  They get mad  Like yeah he should  Have kicked it  Fuck you too  I say to this day  That Jesse was in  Way over his head  And he couldn't  Handle it on an  Intellectual level  And that's why he  Truly walked out  Of this studio  And that's why  He'll never  Come back either  Because he knows  He was outmatched  Good bye  Go take your  Softball fucking things  Or your polite debates  When people don't  Call you out  On your bullshit  Which is asking  A question  And then when  There's a follow 
[01:37:00]  Up question  Just saying  Something  Oh yeah  Okay I believe  That  Excellent point  Great point  You're a big  Strong guy  That has opinions  And you think  You're intelligent  Then why wouldn't  You come back  And argue again  Yeah but those  Guys actually  Why wouldn't you  Those guys go out  On these press  Things to promote  Shit  And they have  A script that  They're actually  Using over and  Over and over again  It's like they're  Doing jokes  The same script  When you fucked  With that  When you took  He had nothing to say  What is he going to do  I don't care if he likes me  It is of absolutely  No value either way 
[01:37:30]  The only thing is  I wish that the video  That was online  Showed the entire argument  Because it makes it look  Like I went after him  When I didn't  Because you don't see  The beginning  Where he was fucking  Where he was nasty  To me first  So all you dummies  Out there  That will go  Hey how come  You just attacked  The company  Listen to the audio  Because the video  Doesn't tell the full story  So if you've only  And I've actually  Had people email me  And say nasty shit  I'm like you fucking dope  Did you listen to the audio  No  Go listen to it  And you tell me 
[01:38:00]  I insulted him first  The whole audio  Is online  I know it is  Yeah  But they're lazy  The video that got  Really popular  Is unfortunately  Right before  You know he walked out  Yeah  The whole video  The whole interview  Is certainly online  So it looks like  The governor's being rational  And I'm just attacking him  But the audio  Leading up to that  Was he fucking insults me  He calls me  An asshole  He's like  He just  He got nasty first  And he doesn't want  To admit that  Because then it makes  It look like he got  What he had coming  Which was being insulted  Yeah  Point after point  He was getting his ass kicked  More importantly 
[01:38:30]  Bobby once again  Not caring about  What's going on in the studio  Had to  Had to  Had to take a picture  With his giant camera  I was actually  I'm just trying to do  What Anthony does  When he's here  With all the chicks  And stuff  And trying to  Trying to get the video  And all kinds of things  Going on  I hate your iPad  To fucking camera  Why  Why would you want  To take pictures like that  Like what  It's giant  It's not a giant  It's a giant camera  It's not  It's the same camera  That's in your iPhone 
[01:39:00]  I don't have an iPhone  It's not a fucking giant  Because the  It's not a bigger camera  You just held up  This giant thing  To take a picture of Jimmy  I held up the iPad  Why is that cool technology  The camera's that small  It's a pinhole  It looks like  The whole thing's a camera  Now  They don't adjust  The size of the camera  To the fucking product  I just hate it  I just hate  I just hate what you just did  I just hate it  I agree with you  No more iPad  I'm done  I'm all done  You're into the iPad too  I'm into the iPad too  I was actually listening  To the actual argument 
[01:39:30]  You guys were saying  But  What argument  About stupid Jesse  I  Jimmy's way right on this one  He's absolutely right  It was a great debate that day  And I saw  Jesse was just crumbling  He had nothing  To come back  With some pretty heavy questions  Heavy questions were being asked  He had nothing that day  But he was doing  He's never been debated  No one ever came across  And  Jimmy  Was doing it  In a  You know  An aggressive way  And he's used to  It wasn't that aggressive  The first  The first right 
[01:40:00]  Yeah but he's used to being  The big guy  And intimidating people  And you didn't give a shit  About if he hit you or not  That's one thing  That nullifies  A fucking big guy  Who usually intimidates  People with their size  And their strength  Or how they look  When a guy doesn't  Care about getting a beating  That's usually  That nullifies  Their fucking bullshit  And that's what you did  You nullified his  Threats of stairs  And shit  There was one moment  Where he  Really began to  Like we were debating  And he said something about  Because I hadn't served  And I was 
[01:40:30]  Saying I want  Guys over there fighting  And I explained to him  Why I felt  Afghanistan was justified  As opposed to  I felt it was a reaction  To being attacked  On 9-11  Right  And the Taliban  Was protecting  Bin Laden  And wouldn't give him up  And that's why I felt  It was an appropriate reaction  And it was  It was a good explanation  And I was rational with him  And he gave me  Such a snotty  Fucking  Teenage girl answer  He said  I wasn't listening 
[01:41:00]  I wasn't listening  Like he  Then he started  Just being a jerk off  And then we just  Started getting nasty  With each other  But I remember that moment  That's not in the video  I don't think  It might  Maybe it is  I haven't watched it  In a long time  There's a lot of  Jesse Ventura videos  Online  Yeah  And in a lot of  These videos  You can see that  He can't really  Back up a lot of his stuff  He stinks  And I'm telling you  When he says  He was  Quoting  We're talking about  JFK  He's fucking  Quoting Oliver Stone's  Movie  Yeah you can't do that  Yeah  It seemed pretty accurate  But in the end 
[01:41:30]  It was  But you guys  Act surprised  This guy was  He wore a bow  No  He's a wrestler  No  We're surprised  Because he was  The governor  Of Minnesota  Bob Kelly  I could become  The fucking  Governor of Minnesota  Then that's fucking scary  Yeah it's scary  That's the point  If he was still  A wrestling guy  Who cares  But this guy  Was pretty damn  Powerful in politics  Yeah but he was  And now he's saying  There's a grass roots  Movement to make him  The president  Really  That ain't happening  Of course it's not happening  And the other thing  I want to know  Is how does Howard  Handle him 
[01:42:00]  I'm kind of curious  Does Howard go after him  Or does he  I think they enjoy his  Does he look at him  Kind of like as  Like a sideshow  I've heard  Five minutes of  Stern interview  I don't know  The context was  I'm curious actually  They were like  Really so you think  That like  More like  The way Ron Bennington  Would probably interview  The Westboro Church  Whereas I'm sure  That they think  Some of what he's saying  Is nonsense  But they're kind of  Going with it  But again I heard  Five minutes  So he may go after him  Going with it because  I don't think he's scared of him  I think it's just  The angle 
[01:42:30]  Yeah yeah  Listening to him  Is good radio in itself  Yeah maybe  Let him babble about  A lot of this stuff  I just get too annoyed  And that's fine  If the guy doesn't  Respect me  You don't have to  But don't  Don't be surprised  If I make a point  If we're on the mic together  And I make a point with you  And we're debating  Back and forth  I'm not debating  A big guy  I'm just debating a guy  We're just  I'm not threatening you physically  I can't  He would throw me  Through a wall  I'm not deluded  And you know  That video continues 
[01:43:00]  To fucking do well  It's approaching  A million views  And it's  That video went everywhere  So  And he knows  It went everywhere  So he should come back  Well he was embarrassed  In it so he doesn't like it  And I have no  I don't care  All you truth is out there  I know they hate me  And I don't care  Your anger is irrelevant to me  I've debated you guys  I've had you on the air  We've had you on the air  And I just didn't like  The guys that came on  And it's not your point of view  I just disagree  With your point of view  But the guys that came on  That fucking little 
[01:43:30]  That little baby boy defiance  And then anything  That remotely connects  To their point  They seize  And no matter how big  The evidence is  If it counteracts  Their point  They ignore it  That's why I can't stand them  I just hate that  A lot of people think  I shaved my head  Because they think  It's me in that video  I want to basically  Put on the screen  This is not me  Because some of those  Fuckers scare the shit  Out of me  Oh they're fucking  The worst 
[01:44:00]  They're fucking  Angry emails  Who gives a shit  Really  Gives a fuck  You didn't like it  I didn't like what he said  So we had an argument  Two people had an argument  Big deal  Can I put a big arrow  On that video  This is Jim Norton  Please  Tell him Twitter  Jim Norton  Yes  And Twitter  I would sleep way better  At night  Because they all think  It's me  If I ever see you  In the street  Type of shit  I've gotten that shit too  Really  Well here's where I work  Stupid  My calendar's up  I'm not a tough guy  But don't give me 
[01:44:30]  A fucking phony outrage  Because me  And the ex-wrestler  He can handle himself  If he didn't touch me  Let's not get carried away  I mean you do  You go with a guy  Who has a gun  To the bathroom  We don't talk about guns  On this show Bobby  We don't know  We don't know how  He means Kenny  Anybody has  I mean Kenny  Oh  But we go on the road together  Yeah so you have a bodyguard  I mean you're not  But the point is  There's guns all over the place  If it happened to Comedy Cellar  I'm a bodyguard  Or fucking Carolines  Alright  Colin Quinn could fight  Colin Quinn can't fight  Colin Quinn could get Jimmy 
[01:45:00]  Out of some fucking situations  Yes he can  He would try  And it would end  As soon as somebody  His knee would give out  And then his little fucking  Thin stylus fingers  Would break  And then his deviated septum  Would clog up  But I don't threaten  People like that  Like I don't tell people  Like be here  And I'll do this  That's why I don't respond  To that kind of shit  Like I've been very angry  At a lot of people  And I've never sent  A cunty email like that  Like you know  If I saw you  You wouldn't do a fucking thing  I have that anger  I know the feeling 
[01:45:30]  You think I haven't thought  About shooting people  I would believe me  I have visually  And vividly fantasized  About putting bullets in people  But I would never say that  In an email  If I see you in the street  Oh fuck yourself  Yeah yeah  Very good  Well  Very good  No it is  Because perfect time  We got Jesse Ventura  On Piers Morgan last night  I heard this was pretty damn good  Also  Make sure I don't forget  Kirstie Alley  Fucking  Fell  She fucking broke her partner  Last night on  Dance with the Stars 
[01:46:00]  I don't watch the show  I really don't  But I saw the clip  Because it's going everywhere  She was too fucking fat and heavy  And basically broke her partner  Last night  This guy  He looked at it  He went stop  Because she tried to keep going  He went  Give me a second  You fat bitch  Yeah  Because he really got hurt  It looks like I should be watching the show  Because Kirstie Alley  Broke her partner  The smoke machine  Malfunctioned last night  So one of the dancers  Disappeared in a fucking fog  And then  And then Danny  I think Danny was the first one 
[01:46:30]  To turn me on to this  Wendy Williams feet  You see that picture  Yeah  Sexy  She has nice feet  Worst feet ever  What do they look like  They look like  They look like a man's feet  First of all  I just ate man  Why couldn't we have done this before  Alright we can wait  Would feet bother you  Oh it was terribly  We wouldn't suck her toes  Where is it Danny  TMZ  Yeah TMZ  Would you suck her toes  After she danced  I would  You'd have to pay me  Tons of money  I would vomit  You want to show it really fast  And then we'll do  Yeah let's see her feet  And then we'll get back 
[01:47:00]  Into some serious shit  To see them tootsies  Look at these feet  Maybe we should tweet this Danny  If you send me a link  I'll give you fucking credit  And we'll just fucking  Tweet this shit to everybody  Because that's all they want to see  Is to fucking tweet it  You better show some respect  Look at these feet  Shut up  Look at these feet  They're just awful  That big bunion on the one  Is barely bad  I'll tweet this in a second  Is that from dancing  Or is that how her feet are normally  Yeah is that from  Is that like a fucking  She's saying it's from dancing 
[01:47:30]  With the stars  But I think  Even if we're all healed up there  There's a world of hurt going on  Could you go down  Because did you see the other foot  With the  Yeah  There's one with the nail polish  I have less of a problem  With that one  No there's a baby toe  Growing out of the middle  Baby toe growing out  By a midget's foot  But then it's  It has nail polish on it  Like you treat it with respect  You don't treat a toe  Like that with respect  You ignore it  If you're getting a fucking painted  Fucking  You keep it outside 
[01:48:00]  Why would you bring attention  To a little  Why  Exactly  I would paint that  Like a fucking baby  I would paint that like a knuckle  Right  You don't give that shit respect  Oh that's funny  They believe it's not there  Look at that fucking thing  Oh that twat  She's probably really confident  She has flip flops  When I tweet this picture  It's the TMZ page  Make sure you go down a little bit  So you see the other one  With the fucking nail polish  Oh my god  Alright  Jesse won't say what he did 
[01:48:30]  In the military  Here we go  We had this fucking interview already  Piers Morgan finally got it last night  When you served in Vietnam  Yep  You didn't I don't think  Actually have live combat there  Right  But you were serving  Is that correct  I don't talk  When I got back  I'm a Navy SEAL  When I got back  From my service overseas  On my first deployment  The My Lai Massacre  Had just happened  Or was just in the headlines  I was brought in  By my commanding officer  My entire team  And we were ordered 
[01:49:00]  We were to discuss nothing  Of anything we did  Or any ops we were on  Because normally  The SEALs are all part  Of a top secret operations  So I do not discuss anything  I did in the military  Other than to say  I served honorably  And received an honorable discharge  And I showed up  Which is more than  What George Bush can say  He's right about that  He did show up  And I always agree with him  When he says about  How these fucking scumbags  Like Cheney  Took deferments  And all that stuff  While guys like that  Went over  But it's like why  If someone says to you  Were you in combat 
[01:49:30]  Even if it was top secret  You can say I was in combat  You either were  Or you weren't  You're saying he's trying  To make more of  What he did in the military  I believe he is  Some people say that  Yes I believe he is  Not some  A lot of people say  That he makes more of it  I've never heard anybody  Not admit they were in combat  I didn't serve  So I should shut the fuck up  No you should  It's a fair question  Here's why it's a fair question  Because I respect the fact  That he was in the military  My father's military  I have a tremendous respect  For him  My dad was military  Yeah  My for real dad was military 
[01:50:00]  Exactly  Just dumped alone  He moved on  Vietnam  He went to Vietnam  He was fucked up  He was in combat  He got fucked up  Came back crazy  But if your whole thing  If every argument  You say  I served  I'm a Navy SEAL  Then your military service  Is a fair question  It's not like people  Going after the guy  Going hey  What did you do  He's bringing it up  He's the one  Who is always saying  I'm a Navy SEAL  So okay  You can't discuss specifics 
[01:50:30]  I understand that  Were you or were you not  In Vietnam  You can fucking discuss  Top secret shit  You can't  You can fucking talk  About what you did  Nah they have a code  Bobby  We've talked to a few  Of these guys  They get really mad  When every once in a while  We'll have someone  On the show  That talks about  Some of the stuff  They did  And then these phones  Are lit by  With guys going  What the fuck dude  You know you're not  Supposed to talk  About that shit  I watch History Channel  And every fucking  Other thing is  Top secret missions  They're reenacting  I mean they talk 
[01:51:00]  About it all the  Fucking time  There's a million  Books about it  These guys don't  Keep their trap shut  And he didn't do  Anything  It's like fucking  Nick Nolte  In Tropic Thunder  He's a fucking  Asshole  Alright  I don't think  I think that he's  He's giving  It's almost like  You can't construct  These little boxes  In which you are  Unquestionable  Like  He makes  Defensive statements  Like  I am a Navy SEAL  Which again  I respect that  But he's saying  That for effect  And he's saying  That to put himself 
[01:51:30]  In a certain position  In the argument  And then when you say  Okay I respect  You're a Navy SEAL  Were you in Vietnam  If he said no  I would still respect  His military service  But he probably feels  That if he wasn't  That would lessen  The strength of him  Saying it like that  And some people think  He got caught up  In a lie  Because now  I mean the instant feedback  He was UDT technically  Underwater demolition team  Which was not Navy SEAL  He became  They integrated Navy SEAL  But people are  In capital letters  Saying he wasn't  A Navy SEAL  Right UDT 
[01:52:00]  Which is  He was a frog man  Yeah the UDT  And the Navy SEALs guys  That's kind of like  If you're NYPD  And now you know  You got the traffic cops  Wearing the NYPD logo  It fucking pisses  The NYPD off right  Well let me ask you  The cops  Military guys would know  This a lot better  But didn't the UDT  Come before the SEALs  And then the SEALs  They became the SEALs  How much longer  After he was there  Or was it while he was there  I don't know  Is it a technicality then  I don't know if it is or not  Are the duties the same?  Well the Navy has the Seabees 
[01:52:30]  That go in before everybody  They're actually pretty badass  You know the Navy gets a bad rap  For just bringing people there on boats  But the Seabees actually go in before everybody  And build the bridges  And all the fucking camps  And all that shit  You got different divisions  So it might have been something  I don't know  If he had to go in before the SEALs  That's pretty fucked up  It was UDT  Which again  I'm almost positive  If I was one of those guys  I would build a shitty bridge  I think  Why?  Just because my work ethic  With hard labor sucks  Would you just be missing bolts? 
[01:53:00]  I don't know  Or I'd be scared  You'd put together a bridge  Like you'd do an Ikea furniture  Right  I would just be scared  Do you have any military guys  That can correct us on that?  They're ringing  So  I don't have one yet  But we'll get one  Let's play the second clip  Jesse explains why  We're actually in Afghanistan  On Piers Morgan last night  Do you want to know  Why we're in Afghanistan?  I'm fascinated  It came to me six months ago  When a story came out  That they found a vein of lithium there  That they say is worth a trillion dollars  Now what is lithium used for? 
[01:53:30]  Every cell phone  Every computer  And soon to be electric cars  So why don't they just  Piers tell me the truth  We're going there to get lithium  So that we can live like we live  Don't sit and try to sell me  We're to give democracy to the world  Jesse, it sounds a bit like you'd been on lithium  Come on, you can't seriously imagine  We've gone to war in Afghanistan over lithium  Come on  Be serious  I am serious  My brother just served a seven-month tour of Afghanistan  I am serious  He did not risk his life for lithium 
[01:54:00]  What did he risk it for?  He risked it because everybody knows  That Osama bin Laden was training people  To commit atrocities in Afghanistan  We all know that  That's a fact  You're talking to the wrong guy  Well, you're a conspiracy theorist  I don't believe 9-11  But you don't believe in anything  No, I believe in  You believe everything has an ulterior motive  Not true  Not true at all  Wow, good for Piers  He's right  And lithium, I thought it was oil  Guys  I thought it was oil  He said he only learned this six months ago  Oh, it's kind of like when he came up with this 9-11 theory  He had been at ground zero 
[01:54:30]  Saw the demolition guy  Saw those buildings  He was down there  And he didn't think conspiracy then  It was a couple of years after that, I believe  Somebody may know the timeline better than me  But he didn't fucking  He wasn't down at ground zero  The guy who  Every time you call him out on that  He goes, oh, okay  I guess you understand explosives  I guess you understand  Meaning he's the authority  Well, hey, authority  While you were there  Why didn't you see something?  Right  You were at the wreckage  And that's exactly what he does  When he's in over his head  Oh, I guess you believe 
[01:55:00]  You know  You know  That's a non-point you just made there  It's a non-point  If you know, then tell us  Right  How they fucking did it  We've asked them many times  How do they fucking wire that building  Like Anna said many times  That all these people fucking working  And doing their jobs  And you're secretly wiring this fucking building  Or painting it with the fucking thermite paint  And no one notices  The only level of conspiracy  And I don't even believe this  But if a conspiracy theorist said  Look, I believe it happened the way they did  But I think we had intel that indicated it  And the government stepped aside  Because they wanted it  I still don't believe that 
[01:55:30]  But that's not as crazy to me  Even though I think it's wrong  As wiring the building  If you really think they wired those buildings  You're a dummy  You're a fucking dumb person  I mean, we've talked about this a million times  But you're dumb  Because what if one of those planes didn't take off?  What if one of them had mechanical issues  And had to go back to the gate?  Then you have one building with a plane crash into it  And one wired to blow up?  You fucking idiots  What if the fucking passengers flipped out 
[01:56:00]  And fucking took over the plane  Like they did on the fourth flight, yes  And crashed it into fucking  And why did they need the buildings to actually come down?  The planes hitting the buildings was certainly bad enough  They just hit a fucking grand slam that day  But if the buildings never went down  It certainly would have been extremely powerful as well  Lithium  Lithium  That's why we're there  He's a crazy person  He's full of shit  He's fucking crazy  You think he's full of shit though?  Yes, full of shit  He's just trying to further himself 
[01:56:30]  And I think he believes what he says with a lot of stuff  I'm not saying he's a liar  I just think that he's fucking full of shit  Because I think he takes whatever he can  To further his image as the conspiracy theory leader  Sure  Yeah, but he's crazy  I mean, he's got problems  I don't know if he's crazy  No, he does  He has a fucking  No one wants to say that though  He's crazy  No, he's fucking nuts  It seems like he is  He's got a problem  He's got a problem  And then he'll say stuff that I agree with  Which is what he says 
[01:57:00]  The way he says it  Is fact  There's no other option  What he says  Is how it is  That's not how fucking  That's not  That's how petulant children act  Well, that narcissist, man  He's fucking nuts  He believes that he is the fuck  A god  All right, listen  He's out of his mind  The phones are lit  A lot of military guys  If you're on hold right now  Just make it quick  I want to race through all these  Yeah, and I want to know  Very quickly, if possible  We're going to start with  Ron in Hartford  Ron, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, just to answer 
[01:57:30]  Jimmy's question  UDT teams were around  In World Wars I and II  I believe  They were rolled into  The SEAL teams  In 1962 by Kennedy  Okay  So yeah, he is a Navy SEAL  Because he was UDT  They were rolled together  As a single unit  But comparatively  To today's Navy SEALs  The training is nothing  Like today's  And it's kind of like  The meter mate thing  Like I tried to make  The point earlier  They got rolled into  The NYPD  So what does that mean 
[01:58:00]  In the end?  Did he get respect, Ron?  Yeah, yeah  Well, in the 60s  Underwater demolitions  Was the SEALs  It was the same thing  Nowadays  There's no separation  Between the two  But back then there was  And then Kennedy  Rolled them into  The same unit  Okay  So why does he say  How come he never says UDT  Which I think is respectable  Because that's not as cool  As Navy SEALs  And no one knows UDT  Yeah  Navy SEALs  People kind of have a feeling 
[01:58:30]  What that's all about  Right  Thank you, Ron  I want to give everyone  A chance really quickly here  Jamie in Staten Island  Go ahead  Yeah, I used to have  A high school teacher  His name is Mr. Walter  He served in Korea  And like the worst thing  You can ask somebody  In the military  Is if they ever killed someone  I found this out  Because he just looked at me  With a deadpan look  In his face  And says  I'm here, aren't I?  No, that means  He didn't kill anyone  If I went  I would tell people  I killed people  No  Wouldn't you, Bobby?  Yeah  Some guys don't grab  Where if I take a life  Just to survive  Yeah  I guess  If I killed somebody 
[01:59:00]  I wouldn't fuck  I'm a problem with it  You wouldn't have a problem  With killing somebody?  No, not at all  I've fucking  I've thought about it  Even when you went to Iraq  Yeah  You get  I got in my head  I was like  Yeah, I'll fucking kill  Anybody I have to  I'd kill somebody  Someone's saying  UDT and Navy SEALs  Didn't come together  Until eight years  After Ventura left  That's what I  That's the impression  I was under  How does this guy know?  This guy just said 62  I don't know why  I think that's  Ray in Texas  How do you know this?  Well, I'm retired military  25 years  And I work a lot  With various other services 
[01:59:30]  And special forces  I was Air Force  But we work a lot  With the Navy  And you can even look up  Jesse Ventura  On Wikipedia  I think  And I think it even describes  The dates of service he had  And then you can look up  UDT and Navy SEALs  And find out the date  Where they merged  And they're eight years apart  Okay  It's the wrong way  Yeah, what year do they merge?  You know?  Whatever  You know, I'm driving my car right now  On my way to work 
[02:00:00]  But I know that  If you look at his dates of service  And when he was in Vietnam  And when he got out of the Navy  And then you look up  Because I had an argument  With somebody one time  And, you know, we had to go online  And prove this, whatever  And I actually at the time  Had lost the argument  And interestingly enough  That famous photograph  That he shows of himself  Wearing his, you know  Tiger stripe uniform  And holding the M-16  And whatnot  Was actually an outtake  Or a shot  From the movie Predator  It wasn't actually  When he was in the Navy  Get the fuck out of here 
[02:00:30]  You're kidding me  I would love to know  That's true  Yeah  I'm going to do my own research  After the show  Yeah, the eight-year part  Is absolutely true  I mean, you can  And frankly  You guys, you guys  You know  Look them both up  I mean, you've got  All kinds of computers there  Okay  You can look it up  You can look up  The dates of it  And as I said  I thought he really was  A Navy SEAL  But I lost it  I think I lost a round of drinks  In a bar one time  Over that one  Okay, man  Thank you  Road soda in Houston  He goes  Just because he works at NASA 
[02:01:00]  Doesn't make him an astronaut  Good point, I guess  Yeah  And then this guy  Wants you to get off  And tour his dick  Let's go to Johnny in Brooklyn  Johnny  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, Johnny?  Hey  Hey, I've been listening to your show  For a couple of weeks, man  I like it  But  This guy, Jimmy  What's your problem with Jesse, man?  He's fighting a good fight  I'll tell you my problem with Jesse  I'll tell you  We had interviewed him  I respected him  We had interviewed him three times  The first time he and I debated 
[02:01:30]  Back and forth  And  You know, look  When you're saying stuff like he says  You're going to have debates  And then he pushes  You can't see it  Because you're listening on the radio  But like  When he's in the room with you  He pushes the mic away  Well, hold on  I'm telling you  You asked me a question  Let him answer the question, Johnny  I didn't hear you  Okay  He pushes the mic away  When he's not getting his way  In an argument  I heard you  You got me good, man 
[02:02:00]  That's funny  That was a fucking good one  I think he even cleared his throat  And fucking revved up for that one  That was a good one  Jesse explains his theory on 9-11  On Piers Morey  Like I said  We did this years ago  But he's finally doing it on  A show that has a larger audience, obviously  Let's move to 9-11  Okay  Your theory of 9-11 is what?  My theory of 9-11 is that we certainly  At best  We knew it was going to happen  They allowed it to happen  To further their agenda in the Middle East 
[02:02:30]  And go to these wars  So just to clarify  President George Bush  Knew that 9-11 was going to happen  That 3,000 people were going to get murdered  They had all the information  If you looked at the NSA  I'm suggesting he knew  If you look  Well, put it to you this way  The August 6th memo  Was pretty clear  But are you  Do you genuinely believe  Jesse Ventura  That President George W. Bush  Knew 9-11 was going to happen?  No  Why do you say it then?  No  Why do you say it? 
[02:03:00]  But I believe Dick Cheney knew it  Really?  Yep  You believe he knew it was going to happen?  I believe they had a good  Well, why did John Ashcroft quit flying commercial planes that summer  And switch only to private planes?  Why did that happen?  See, pause right there  That's what he does  That's what he does  That I hate so much  Yeah, we don't know if that's true  We'd have to look it up ourselves  Even if it is true  Right  Because he asks a question  You say, do you think that's true? 
[02:03:30]  Do you think, Jesse?  That Dick Cheney knew  Why do you think that?  Well, why did John Ashcroft?  He's answering that question with another question  He asked you why you think Dick Cheney knew  Show me evidence that Dick Cheney fucking knew it  Let's stay right there  Right  Why did John Ashcroft do?  I don't know  We didn't ask you that  But that sounds ominous  Anything you ask  Yeah  Sounds ominous  Well, why did John Ashcroft all of a sudden start wearing red suits?  I don't know  And because you don't know 
[02:04:00]  That makes it seem like he has said something right  It's bullshit  It's a fucking horrible arguing technique  And I hate that shit in the debate  It's not horrible  Because a lot of people use it  It's nonsense  Yeah  And it's easy to win  You don't honestly believe these people  I don't believe you believe that  You don't honestly think Dick Cheney knew it was going to happen  You can't do it  Do you really believe  It's not rational  Do you really believe  See, right there  Again, do you  Another question  Do you really 
[02:04:30]  And then his thing is  I'm just asking questions  But you're not  You're bullshitting  It's not  Jesse says evil people can control the government  It's not rational  It's not irrational  Excuse me  Excuse me  Do you really believe  That evil people  Can't be in charge of governments  If you do  Go talk to the Germans  They know a little about that  That evil people  Can get in charge  Oh, by the way  Great example, Jess  So I guess  Because he said  That we couldn't prove  That bin Laden did it  So therefore the Taliban 
[02:05:00]  Shouldn't have turned him over  I guess that we never should have  Killed Hitler then  Because he had not been put through a trial first  I guess we shouldn't have  We shouldn't have  You know  Oh, we didn't kill  He killed himself  But we shouldn't have  Targeted Hitler  I guess  I guess he didn't do anything  Hitler was  As far as I know  I mean, there was  The tribunals after  But he himself  He never had a chance  To verbally defend himself  So what?  Maybe he didn't do it  Well, he would have  If we caught him  He killed himself  Yeah, I know 
[02:05:30]  So  Point I'm making is  Everybody knew  Hitler did what he did  And you can't  I mean, there's these  Idiot holocaust deniers  But we all know  Hitler did what he did  We knew it was bin Laden  And he was saying  The Taliban shouldn't have  Turned him over  Because it wasn't proven in court  He said that  There was no trial  Where was the evidence?  Governments are run by people  Governments  People can be bad  So Dick Cheney's involved  Ashcroft's involved  All these people  Got together  And planned  Come on 
[02:06:00]  It's madness  Oh  That's madness  But you'll fully accept  That  19 Islamic radicals  Armed with box cutters  Taking orders  From a guy  In a cave in Afghanistan  Could defeat  Our multi-billion dollar  Air defense system  Yes  Which the Russians  Couldn't do  Jesse  That's exactly what happened  That's exactly what happened  Really?  Unfortunately  They exposed  A massive flaw  In homeland security  And what was it? 
[02:06:30]  The flaw was  That these guys  Had been training  And often  Aiming to go one way  Aiming to land planes  In a certain manner  In fact not even land them  In order to take off  But not land  All these were clues  That this was a weird  Set of circumstances  I'm afraid  That's exactly what happened  And the trouble  Of being a conspiracy theorist  I've got great respect for you  And your book's very readable  The problem is  Once you start  Buying into these theories  You never stop  And with the internet  These days  There's a theory  About everything  Wow  Fucking peers  I like that  And this is what 
[02:07:00]  Jesse misses  When he said  This is what drives me nuts  His question  So you think  19 Islamic radicals  Could defeat  The multi-billion dollar  Whatever he said  Air defense system  Which the Russians  Couldn't do  Well holy mackerel  That sounds impressive  I guess they couldn't  But they didn't defeat  The air defense system  What they did  Was they  Like he said  They exploited weaknesses  Not only in airport security  But in what pilots  Were trained to do  Because I believe  At that point  Pilots were trained 
[02:07:30]  To negotiate  Right  Because it had never happened  It was a rule  It was a rule  They could not  They were going to land somewhere  They were going to land  Pilots always thought  Well this sucks  But we're going to land somewhere  No no  Pilots had to get out  Of the cockpit  And deal with the terrorists  That was the rule for them  They were not going to have  Their throats cut  No training  Prepared the pilots  For if you don't  Don't open the door  Because they'll cut your throat  And crash the plane  Right  So they exploited  What was a blind side  In fucking even pilot training 
[02:08:00]  And one of those flights  The pilots were told  That the planes had been hijacked  And they didn't lock  The cockpit door  It might have been  The last flight  But there was so many  Mistakes made  But they didn't  His question  He's not talking about this  Why doesn't Jesse  Talk about that  Well do you think  19 radicals  With box cutters  Here's what else he forgets  They had fake bombs  So people believed  That they had  Explosive devices  Why is he not saying that  The pilots didn't  Make a mistake  That was the first time  For all this shit 
[02:08:30]  It had never happened  It had never happened before  So they didn't know  What the fuck to do  We almost forget  How it was before 9-11  Yeah  Going through airports  And flying  I mean the cockpit doors  Were open half the time  You could see the fucking pilots  Like it was nothing  They would wander  On the plane  Like it was nothing  But do you see  What he left out  You see what he left out  Of course  The pilots were trained  To come out  And also the fake explosives  That they had  And people were saying  That there's Islam  Thank you  Muslim guys with bombs  Right  So he's leaving all of that out  And that's why  I can't stand this guy 
[02:09:00]  And he's right down the hall  Can we get fucking Jesse  In here somehow  Can you ask his people  I can try  You want it Jimmy  If he's willing to come in  I'm absolutely fine with it  I just hate begging him  To come in  True  I don't care if he comes in  Go fuck himself  He's welcome  Whenever he wants to come  We're almost done  He was on Piers Morgan  Yesterday  Jesse explains  The JFK assassination  John F. Kennedy's  Yep  Assassination  Yep  Who did that  It was done by 
[02:09:30]  William Harvey  Who was the head  Of the CIA's  Assassination unit  At that time  David Morales  Was directly involved  In it  He likewise  Is the gentleman  Who killed Che Guevara  Down in Bolivia  In 67  Where they put him  Up against a firing wall  And killed him  And shot and killed him  Morales was part of that  I believe that  Because I saw  Heard and read  A confession  From E. Howard Hunt  On a deathbed  To his son  And when he confessed  It was not a confession 
[02:10:00]  Of remorse  It was a confession  Of pride  He wanted the world  To know  That we helped you out  We killed John Kennedy  This communist sympathizer  Jesse  Aren't you being slightly naive  People can say anything  On a deathbed  To immortalize themselves  When I die  I might say  You know what  I don't want anyone  To know about  My long standing love affair  With Elizabeth Taylor  Doesn't mean anything  Does it  I can be slightly naive  Except the fact  That you're not  Going to convince me  He could make those shots  Why  Because I tried them 
[02:10:30]  And I'm an expert  Marksman  He wasn't  By the way  In the Warren Commission  You can see  That he was not only  A marksman  He was a sharpshooter  Oswald in the military  Tested as a sharpshooter  And I believe  That's right above  Marksman  And then when he was  Leaving the military  When they said  The stakes weren't as high  He tested as a marksman  So I don't know  Why he would say that  And those shots  Have been reenacted  I want to say  The specialist  Who did his name  Was Miller  I'm going by memory  Who not 
[02:11:00]  With the same rifle  Not only made their shots  But improved slightly  On the time  So I would like  To know why  He's saying that  If I'm wrong  Somebody can correct me  But I believe  That Oswald  Was a sharpshooter  And he gives more  Evidence here  Jesse  Do you want to know  A reason why  It's a farce  I'll tell you why  Personally  My mother  Before she died  She had a big trunk  And when she died  In the bottom of that trunk  She had every  Minneapolis paper  Of that weekend  That John Kennedy  Was killed  This was in 
[02:11:30]  Minneapolis's  Monday morning paper  That means  This is 63  So it had to go out  Early in the afternoon  Of Sunday  To be in the  Monday morning paper  And you know  What was down  In the bottom  Dallas police  Declare case closed  Come on  Jesse  It's right in the paper  Jesse  The Oswald  Kennedy's killed  On Friday  Ruby kills  Oswald on Sunday  And the Dallas PD  Says the case is closed  They haven't interviewed  A witness  There was no confession  But the case is closed 
[02:12:00]  Well  Come on  Piers  What type of  Investigation is that  By the way  That's one newspaper  Maybe the fucking  Newspaper got it wrong  Yeah maybe  And maybe they took  A quote  Yeah I don't know  From some dumb  Dallas cop  Who said something  Stupid he shouldn't  Have said  And my question is  If Oswald was the  I don't want to  Keep going through this  Why was he allowed  To be questioned  For days  By the fucking police  I forget the name  Of the guy  Who was doing  Most of the questioning  But he's an 
[02:12:30]  Interrogation expert  Why  Were they allowed  To have access  To Oswald  Alone  Oswald was trying  To get an attorney  The guy he wanted  In New York  He couldn't get  Wasn't responding  Back to him  So come on  Stop it  And because some  Dumb cop in Dallas  Made a statement  That he shouldn't have made  It's closed  We got the guy  The guy might have said  A reporter might have said  Hey  How's the case going  Open and closed  We got him  And name a Dallas police  Say  That's your proof  That could have been  Come on  Some excitement on there  The guy interrogating  Was named 
[02:13:00]  Tony the interrogator  No no no no  He had been fired  For pedophilia  Never ever heard  Anybody suggest  The investigations  Were closed  On the Monday  Within hours  It was in the paper  Dallas police  Will you believe  Everything you read  In the papers  I did then  I have rarely  Encountered a man  Who believes less  About what he reads  In the papers  And now you want me  To base your whole  Conspiracy thing  On the fact that  You've read one line  In your mother's  Newspaper from the time  I've studied 
[02:13:30]  John Kennedy  For 25 years  Piers  You're not  I'm not basing this  On reading one line  He's getting his ass  Handed to him  Yeah of course  Once again he is  And he can't walk off  CNN right  Piers is murdering him  In this  Murdering him  In this debate  He's studied  He's studied the case  For 25 years  But he points out  A paper he found  In a trunk  When his mom died  Piers is very smart  The way he's ripping him apart  Is by actually feeding  His self esteem  He's saying  Come on  You don't really do this  You're better than that  So he's actually  He's fucking brilliant 
[02:14:00]  In the way he does  He's not arguing with me  He's not taking it  To a fucking  Great job  By Piers Morgan  I have a newfound  Respect for Piers Morgan  He's really  Piers is doing pretty good  I never listened to his show  He's settling in  He's alright  Alright we should take a break  This all came up today  Just because Jesse's  Making the rounds again  Yeah  He was on Piers last night  He's on Howard right now  Cool  I'm sure he's riveting  Doing a shit load of shows  Lithium  But not ours  Who cares  Literally  We had him on before  He was fine  But he does every show 
[02:14:30]  He's not a special  Big get  Yeah  I don't respect anybody  Me and Chris Jericho  Had a fight  And you know what  He came back  And that was the end of it  It was an argument  And I like Chris  A lot  I really do  And we had  It was a dumb  Argument that got out of hand  You were out of line  We both know  Fucking another one  That could smash me  But you know  We made up  And we're friends now  Well the Jesse thing  With the riffraff  Had he not touched me  And I'm being really honest  I would never  Have  He has awful hair  Insulted him personally 
[02:15:00]  Like that  But I've said it before  When he touched me  I had two choices  Because I'd been matching him  Asshole for asshole  This for that  Either touch him back  And that takes it to a physical level  Which I'm not gonna do  Or insult him  So I insulted him  What'd you say again  About his hair  You're fucking  Thanks for touching me  With you  Something like  Fucking riffraff  From Rocky Horror hairdo  He cut it too  By the way  Have you seen  It's nice and short now  That's stupid hairdo  Probably because of you  He's probably lost  A lot of night's sleep  Over that comment  I threw out clothes 
[02:15:30]  Because of Norton  Look  There's the fucking hairdo  It's so perfect  Alright we're gonna take a break  We're gonna get real busy  After the break  We got Otto and George here  And Jason Ellis is here as well  So we'll throw everyone  In the studio  And see what happens  Okay  Alright  I hear the music  It gets into you  I hear the music  Millions of watts  All of this low level sound  Well it gets into you  And so I said  Well you know what  I hear the music  Bring back the music

[02:18:00]  I called into the show  And then I hung up  And then people said  You should listen to the bit  Where you left  And I listened to it  And you guys were saying  He has no idea  He sounds so excited  Wait till he finds out  About radio  And I believe that I have  Had a couple of meetings recently  Where I might  I'm like  Oh  Now you get it  That's what he's talking about  You see these tired faces  Yeah  It's very tiring  I didn't wake up one day  Looking like this  Years of fucking wear and tear  On this fucking face 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  No it makes your face come off  Yes  Trying to keep this radio thing going  Because they don't get it  They don't get it  If they got it  Wouldn't they have their own show  Yes  Why would they tell me  How to run my show  If they don't know  How to do it as good as I do  I don't know  They don't get it  How many fucking phone calls  Did you get in an hour  You didn't get any  Because you don't have a show  Why are you telling me  What to do  I'm not going to go there  They don't care  Why were they telling you  What you should be doing  Yeah a lot of times  And now they're trying to stop me  Well they're not anymore  Because I flipped out  But I had  I've got another TV show  Besides this one  Oh good  That they shut down 
[02:19:00]  And I was like  You don't want to pay me  And you don't want me to get paid  Something's going to break here  And it could be your face  Wait they  Fuck  I don't really say the face  They won't let you do a TV show  One of them  They shut down  Because they don't like  That organization  After five months  Of making it work out  With all the other TV shows  That I'm doing  They shut it down  But now they said  That they're sorry  And they're going to fix it  And I believe them  What TV shows are you doing man  I have a show  That comes out tomorrow  On Fuel TV  Ellis Mania  That's about just all my boxing 
[02:19:30]  I have this thing called Ellis Mania  Where there's boxing fights  There's only like  One or two real fights in it  But the rest are like  Comedy fights  Where I have dudes blindfolded  And electric dog collars  On their necks  And I have three dudes  Like saran wrapped together  Fighting another three dudes  Saran wrapped together  With only one arm  Behind their back  So they can't protect their face  They can only punch people  Punching  I don't like that  Punching fights  Punching yes he he  You know all that kind of stuff  Transvestites  I say less comedy though 
[02:20:00]  Because you are getting hurt  Do transvestites fight  With like hard-ons  No  A lot of transvestites  Because I'm friends with a lot of them  Because of my awesome job  Yeah  Very rarely  Do you find a tranny  That can get it up  Some of my tranny friends  In porn  Will go off the pill  To get the erection  To bone each other  Is that true  No  Why am I looking at Jimmy  Is that true  If you suck it good enough  Let's go to the expert  I completely disagree  I was told that 
[02:20:30]  It remains  You have to tickle  Right behind the balls  You fuck trannies  No  Not yet  I had an experience  I haven't got the balls yet  What's the worst thing  About eating out  Elizabeth Taylor's cunt  You bang your head  In the casket  Is the punchline  Is the punchline  Really necessary  Sorry  Can't you just move on  With the cunt thing  George is back  Sick of getting x-rayed  Downstairs  I'm getting fucking cancer  They x-rayed a suitcase 
[02:21:00]  They do what  They're getting one of them  Fucking lobster dibs  They get the fucking  Dentist office  Cocksuckers  I got a tumor  The size of a fucking  Hand grenade  I'm getting cancer  Oh shit  Just to come in  The x-rayed  To do this shitty  Fucking joke  With this fucking  Aging  Fucking not too bright  Frat boy over there  And this  Fucking second rate  Headliner  With a fucking  Urine fetish  Jim's a friend of mine  I don't like when  George comes in  Man it's too real 
[02:21:30]  Sorry  What the fuck is that thing  You don't know  Otto and George  You should get some  Tapes brother  You'll love them  Did you get punched  In the face  Like kicked in the head  Or something  A few times  I mean  When I was a street  Performer  I got stabbed once  That wasn't too much fun  Who opened your face up  What this here  Yeah  Oh that was a drunk fall  From tequila  How many stitches is that  That was  I don't know  Maybe 15-20 stitches  Yeah  Yeah  Because when you're drunk  You don't put your hands out 
[02:22:00]  You just go boom  And just smash  Is that an old scar  Yeah right there  We've known you forever  We never asked you  About the scar  That's why Jason's  Going places  It's kind of obscured  By my eyebrow  I go places  Because I noticed the scar  I never noticed the scar  It's because you're  A fucking asshole  And you're over the game  You ever thought of that  Yeah great to have you here  Tell me a joke  Fuck off  What's your website  Oh my god  That's about it  Welcome  Goodbye  What were we going to talk about  The MMA thing 
[02:22:30]  We had Brock on  Recently  You did  Yeah  Is he a nice guy  He was so nice  Honestly Jimmy  He's saying that  It's because he's just  A massive dude  No he was great  We had like 35 minutes  Really nice  He got humor  He seemed to have  A sense of humor  Himself  I was surprised  Yeah he was great  How down earth  The guy really was  Because I never got  That impression before  You've got to have  Some kind of sense of humor  You accidentally get  A penis tattooed  On your chest  He's got to have  A little bit of a humor  Because he's got to see that  It's not a full dick 
[02:23:00]  But it's very similar to  He knows that  We felt like  Not bringing that one up  You didn't do it  I'm dreading the day  He comes on my show  Because I will  Talk about it  Yeah and I feel like  He's the kind of guy  I talked to Dana about it  A long time ago  And Dana said  He will punch you in the head  And I'm like well  If it's on video  You know once again  As you said  On your rising star  That's so great  Knock me out on video  YouTube sensation  He's not a good puncher though  He's a terrible puncher  But he's still 300 pounds  I feel like  If his face touches your head  It's going to do something  Where did you take a punch from? 
[02:23:30]  Chuck  Chuck right?  Yeah but that was just  A punch in the arm  Wasn't that bad?  I mean that was  One of the last times  I ever drank  So I woke up  In the middle of the night  And I had this  Backflip bitch tattoo  Under my armpit  And he punched me  A couple times that night  Because I was calling him a pussy  So he punched me really hard  And knocked me down  But then after I got up  I told some chick  I bet you can't make me spill my beer  While you kick me in the nuts  Because I had like the tight pants  And if you open your legs  You can hold the crutch tight  Yeah  So she was kicking me  And her toe was going in my ass 
[02:24:00]  And I was just watching the beer  Drunk  Going  Ha ha ha ha ha  You can't spill it  You stupid bitch  Kicking  Kicking  Kicking  Until Carrie Hart was like  Okay  I think you've had enough dude  Like stop  And then I was at a club  And I guess my drink  Fell out of my hand  Yeah  And I didn't  I still had my hand  In a glass position  So I didn't know  That it had fallen  And he was like  I think it's time for you  To go to your room  Sent me to my room  I woke up in the middle of the night  I get up  And I'm like  What the fuck  Where am I  And I'm like  Fuck  What the fuck 
[02:24:30]  Is wrong with my arm  There's a big egg on it  From when Chuck punched it  A bunch of times  And then I noticed  That I had bitch on there  And then I noticed  That I have a full on pain  Not in the fucking taint  In the fucking hole  Like the hole is sore  Because the girl shoe  Is going in my hole  Stabbing me in the hole  Oh shit  You sure it was just the shoe  Or maybe there was something else  That happened after you  Maybe that's where you got  The tranny information  That's what I thought  That wasn't holding  Beer position  That was holding  Huge cock position  Well maybe  Kerry Hart tells me  That it was because of that 
[02:25:00]  I don't remember  Maybe I did get fucked in the ass  You don't remember the tattoo  I don't remember anything  Come on  You really don't remember  Getting tattooed  I drank at 9 o'clock in the morning  And this incident  Started happening  At around 8, 9 o'clock at night  I was putting cigarettes  Out of my arm  That's the last thing I remember  Didn't Fedor kick you too  How hard was Fedor's kick?  Not very hard  I took an arm thing  He's very strong  He is very strong  But he didn't want to  I saw the video  You're downplaying  You got kicked pretty good  By Fedor  It wasn't a full kick  I had to go to hospital 
[02:25:30]  Who?  Kit Cope  He's like a four time  Muay Thai world champion  Long time before I ever trained  That was the first one  In the show  I was like  Hey man kick me  And this was a friend  Who knew that I was ready to roll  And he put fighting shorts on  Took his shoes off  And gave me a legitimate  Muay Thai kick  And I just  I held a microphone to my leg  And looked away  And was very relaxed  Didn't tense up or anything  And he just chopped one in  And then I got like a hematoma 
[02:26:00]  And had to go to hospital  And get like a needle  Injected under my kneecap  To pop the blood sack  Was it a kick  Like a side kick?  Leg kick  No no  But it came so  A forward kick?  I stood facing  No no no  Like that  Yeah like a  Kicked out my front leg  Wow  But he really  He really chopped into it  Who the fuck are you?  Yeah why would  I'm a guy  Look man you couldn't know  A long time ago  Fucking violence on radio  I'm not violent  I don't even like fighting  If somebody's fucking  In an altercation in the bar  I'm out of there 
[02:26:30]  Unless it's my mum  I'm gone  No offence Jimmy  But if someone puts you there  I'd be like  Hey man  I'm gonna call the fucking cops on you  Well that's always the best thing to do  All kidding aside  Yeah  Do you like the pain?  Not  Yeah a little bit  But not really  You have to like the pain a little bit  Not as much as I would  Like this new thing  Because fucking animals bite me all the time now  Because that's just  Oh we're fucking crazy on the Jason Ellis show  Fucking anacondas bite me  Everyone's like  I love it when anacondas bite you  So now  All these cocksucking animals come here  To my show all the time  And attack me  So I get this TV show on Phil TV 
[02:27:00]  And they're like  Do you think it's great when animals bite you?  So I go on their shitty show the other day  And they've got the same fucking animals that bite me  And they're like  Pull a card out of the  And oh Ellis you've lost  You get the lizard  There's some massive lizard that bites and doesn't let go  Look I've still got holes in it  It's teeth snapped off in my arm  Would you take a bite from an animal?  No  I would probably do that  I would do that before I get punched or kicked  Fuck a bite?  I would take a bite  Snakes bite my face and shit 
[02:27:30]  For ratings or just like on a dare?  Just to be  Just to fool around a little bit  Right  I would do that  I wouldn't do the kick or the punch or anything  You take a bite from a lizard  You're dead now  You can fuck around with a lizard  You can't die  It's not on the neck  Are you getting any fucking infections or anything from these bites?  I got infected from the anaconda bite one time  Fuck yeah  Big anaconda  Like a nine foot anaconda  Alright maybe I wouldn't take a bite  Filthy teeth on those disgusting things  Yeah the saliva  Yeah it'll get infected  But you know you gotta  You take care of it  You know  From MMA  You know  Staph infection 
[02:28:00]  All this bullshit  Staph infection is no joke  You've gotta be  You know I mean I clean  I have like this body wash  What's the soap you use?  Is it defenses called?  No it's fucking athletic body  Some MMA shit  I wash with it  And I have  I put on like a moisturizer  After I roll with people and stuff  And it's good  I haven't had staph since  Kevin Randleman  His staph infection was  Google that shit  You wanna see a staph infection?  Mayhem had one  That's just as that 
[02:28:30]  Under his armpit  You can see inside his body  And he can put your fist in it  Jesus  It's a staph infection  They get out of fucking control man  These tough guys  That roll with it  That's the problem  Like if I see it  If I feel it  Cause I know it now  I've had it like four or five times  I feel it  I go to the doctor  These guys  Cause it's not my life  That's why my ears aren't cauliflower  If I hurt my ear  I stop  Cause it's not my job  You know what I mean  I love doing it  But it's not my job  It's not my living  It's not my bread and butter  These guys will just keep going  That's why their ears look like that 
[02:29:00]  They chew them up  And then they show up at the gym  The next day  And fucking rub it on people  They get staph  They're like  Ah you know what I mean  Fucking  You know do some sit ups  Get it you know  I'll fucking  I'll sweat it off or something  They're all fucking idiots  They're all insane  Mayhem had one  So bad on his neck  And he took his girlfriend  To the snow  And I remember  He came to my birthday party  The day before  And he had a bandaid on it  And he was  Talking and yelling  In the restaurant  And sweating  So the patch came off  So it was like  Opening on his neck  And he's telling the story  And I'm like  Dude 
[02:29:30]  That thing  Is now being exposed  To people at a restaurant  You need to go home  Is it that contagious  Oh yeah  If you touch it  You're fucking getting it  For sure  If you touch it  But it's not airborne  No  No but still  But why  When it gets that bad  To me  Because I've had it  So many times  I'm out  I'm going  What do you feel like  When you first start  To notice it  Sick  Like you're getting sick  Oh okay  You run down  Getting sick  How do you know  Where it is though  Well if I feel  Whenever I get sick  Now  I check my body  For bumps  Just to see if  It's not the flu

[02:37:30]  I mean this whole  I'm suing the airline for checking me for having metal  Because they should know that Jesse Ventura  Doesn't have any guns or weapons  And he's not a threat to America  It's like too fucking bad asshole  Not everybody knows you  You fucking idiot  You're a fake wrestler  But he didn't feel like he had to go through  What everybody else has to go through  Everybody should go through whatever it is  Right  I mean oh we're taking photos of your dick  When you have to go through  Here's my fucking dick  Yeah  Like just take the photo of the dick  And move on  I don't give a fuck either  Yeah  I would love if that was  Just walk in  Take a photo  And go through 
[02:38:00]  The bullshit that they put you through now  Sucks  It's getting worse huh  Yeah  I haven't flown in a while  Doesn't bother me  Yeah what are they going to look at your fucking pod  Stewardesses have way too much power too  They can have you fucking arrested  For just any  You can't question them  Anything shitty  You can't be disagreeable  Yeah they used to be just waitresses  Now they have a lot of power man  They can have you fucking  Thrown off the plane  For any kind of infraction  What they consider a bad attitude  What are you doing?  You cranky  They're all middle age fucking moody bitches  Yeah  Just if you disagree  Like if there's a problem  Any kind of problem 
[02:38:30]  They've just gotten cunty  In a minute  They've just gotten cunty and shitty  They're fucking the worst  Oh yeah  They've got tons of power now  I think the flying thing  Used to be a fun thing to do  A long time ago  Like 20 years ago  It was very enjoyable  It was like a holiday  Before the holiday started  When the rich people did it  It was a rich thing  It wasn't every  The average fucking dickhead  From a farm  Can jump on a plane now  But I do understand their frustrations  I mean a lot of people  When I get on a plane  Still to this day  Like you know  How do you put the seatbelt on  How do you  Oh I didn't know you had to take your shoes off  It's like  Motherfuckers 
[02:39:00]  Yeah  You gotta take your shoes off  Why are you wearing a fucking  Hundred pieces of jewelry  When you go on the plane  Put that shit in your bag  And wear some sweatpants  They should have  They should have  An expert flyer line  And fucking novice  Like if you have a card  I'm an expert  I pass all the fucking  I know what the fuck I'm doing  I'm going in this line  And then a bunch of  And then novice  Fuck it  You idiots  With your fucking dumb hats  And your necklaces  Yeah  But flying used to be fun  And now  It's an experience  That we're just happy

[02:43:30]  And I stood on a block  Of hash in the park  That was as big  As a Rubik's Cube  And I couldn't believe  That it existed  And I thought  This must be the greatest  Country in the world  So yeah  It was massive  And I was like  Is this really hash  Wow  To the point where  I traced it on a piece of paper  With a pencil  And folded a piece of paper up  Put it in my pocket  To take it home  To show people  The diameter  Of a block of hash  That I found in the park  And me and this  Swedish skateboarder  Went back to this  Red Bull chick's house 
[02:44:00]  And I was with this chick  Smoking hash  And he was on her  In the kitchen  On top of her  And he blue-balled her  Past the living room  Took a long time  But from the kitchen  Past us in the living room  Down the corridor  Into that bedroom  They didn't stand up  He just  Blue-pumped her  She wasn't fucking her  He was just blue-balling her  All the way  And I remember like  I was making out with her  Smoking some weed  And I'd look over  And I'm like  Where are they?  Oh, they've moved like 10 feet  And then some more finger banging  And then until he disappeared  He blue-balled her 
[02:44:30]  Into her room  Wow  Then you fucked her?  I didn't fuck that one  The other guy fucked that one  Swedish guy  Swedish guys are creepy  Why?  Why?  I think they like to fist each other  And they say weird things  Yeah, it's a European thing  They don't get sarcasm  They don't get sarcasm either  No  Their humour is very fucking  And then you make a joke  They're like  What?  Very hateable  Very hateable  A lot of my friends hate  My Swedish friend  They go  This is possible  Yeah, very stupid  This is possible  What's his name?  Swedish friend  Matthias Ringstrom  Yeah, Matthias 
[02:45:00]  I fucking hate him too  With that name  What a horrible name  It is  You know, I actually hated the guy  Because he was kind of a nerdy skateboarder  And when he showed up  He was like  Yeah, I will be champion  I'm like  You're a fucking meatball moron  His name is Matthias?  Yeah  Good thing his last name isn't cold  Yeah  Matthias Cold  Matthias Cold  I didn't like the dude  And then in Amsterdam  Three o'clock in the morning  I'm looking for hookers  And there he is  Talking to a hooker  Trying to get a blowjob 
[02:45:30]  For twelve bucks fifty  And I overheard him saying  Look, I only have a twelve fifty  What can I get?  And then he goes in there  And I'm like  Son of a bitch  So I wait  And he comes out  And I'm like  Dude  Did you just pay twelve bucks  To get a blowjob?

Yeah  I was top ten for like fifteen years  I was really good at it  I know you were good  Fucking skateboarding  The whole fucking world  Yeah  What was the coolest place?  That question, I get it  Well Amsterdam was the coolest place  For a long time  Because back, you know  Before I lived in LA  And it was legal to smoke weed  It was  I went to a store  And smoked weed  And got a hooker  And took space cake  And I was like  This is the greatest place  In the world  But then, you know  Things change  I would say  I went to a contest  In France 
[02:46:30]  Le Grand Bernard  I never heard of it  We took a bus there  And I'm out in the middle  Of the fucking nowhere  With castles  And a vert ramp  And we had like  A big riot that night  And somebody had a  Somebody  The French people  Were doing back spins  Break dancing  And then an American guy  Did a helicopter  And the French dude  Kicked the American  While he was doing a helicopter  He was a friend of mine  And I ran in there  To punch that dude  In the face  Before I got there  Twenty people  Were on top of that dude  And then another stack  And then it was just  A huge riot  And the mayor came out 
[02:47:00]  And he was like  You need to all go  To your rooms  Or you will be arrested  For three days  And then some dude  Knocked him off the mic  And was like  Let's fucking trash this place  And then we all  Smashed off  And I got dragged  Out of a riot  Because I blew my knee out  It didn't work  I was on crutches  And I did really well  On the contest in Germany  The weekend before  And I punched a beer mug  And I had all these stitches  So I had  Arm in a sling  And a  Like a wrecked leg  So I couldn't run  And there was tear gas  And shit  So when a car went by  I took my 
[02:47:30]  Sling thing off  And I just grabbed  Onto the back of the car  It was just skidding  Down the street  Holding onto the back  Of the car  And then I remember  Another skateboarder  Going fuck yeah Alice  And I was like what  And I look over  And it's another skateboarder  Lee Ralph saying  Fuck yeah  And he was trying to  Skid on the back too  And I was like  Fuck yeah man  We're doing it  And he was like  You're on fire man  You're on fire  And I was like  Fuck yeah  And then we went  To high five somehow  While skidding  And my bad hand  Was hanging on  So when I went  To high five  And my hand came off  And I just did 
[02:48:00]  The fucking scorpion skid  Like my feet  Slowly went past my face  And then I just  Limped out of there  And didn't go to jail  I hurt my knee  Playing touch football  Don't tell the  Don't  You're gonna embarrass us  Jesus Christ  You play touch football  He blew out his knee  What the fuck  Who are you man  This guy's like a superhero  And he cried  And do we have  The famous clip  I want Jason  I didn't fucking cry  Hold my hand  You weren't crying  I asked for help  You asked for help  He wanted to hold  Someone's hand  I'll let you ask  For a painkiller

No that was my friend  Who was holding my hand  And I was squeezing his hand  Because it hurt  And then he felt gay  So he pulled his hand away  Good  You should have  And then you wanted it back  How old were you at the time?  I was actually 35  Hold my hand  Hold my hand  Hold my hand 
[02:52:00]  Instinctively like  You know where the guy  Saving Private Ryan  Fucking dies  And he starts calling out  The mummy  When he's on heroin  Mummy  Mummy  Fucking hold my hand  Like what's holding your hand  Dude  It's not a painkiller  It's not going to do anything  Bobby fucked up his knee though  You're the Lee Marvin  What did you do?  Toss it  ACL  ACL  MCL  Yeah  I actually bent sideways  The knee hurts  Touched up here  And then bent front way  He popped it good  So I heard it  He's got dead guy stuff  And I've never  Oh yeah  Godavers

I'm surprised you're not  In shock you didn't puke  No  I also  The only reason why  I kept saying that  Is because  When you're with all guys  Especially the crew 
[02:53:00]  You know they're not  Going to believe you  They're going to go  Dude shake it off  Shake it off  Yeah  If it was all women  I'd have a fucking name  I needed them to know  Immediately  I'm not fucking around man  Something bad  Because nobody saw it  So I needed them to know  When did the pain go away?

[02:53:30]  Were swollen  And I broke both of my ankles  So they x-rayed my fucking ankles  Jimmy would you be a  Hold my hand guy?  Yeah  I think I might  I don't know  I might have fucking said that too  I split my head open one time  From a baseball  Yeah  I had to go to the hospital  And while they were taking me  Like I think on a stretcher  I said pray for me  Not really though right?

[03:00:00]  I broke my leg, man.  I got a squeeze.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  I'm in so much pain.  Sirius XM, the virus. 
[03:00:30]  This is the OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show.  Yeah, I don't know who she is.  We got Jason Ellis in the studio.  Shut up, we're on the air.  I don't feel like going to fucking human resources. 
[03:01:00]  I've never had to go before, and I'm not going to start now.  Maybe the whispering didn't hint it off to you.  What happened?  Yeah, your microphone's like my microphone in L.A.  This is Ghost in the Machine or something.  What the fuck is this?  He just had a Mickey Mouse.  I felt so much better.  It just collapsed.  It just fucking collapsed.  Even OB and Anthony Show is a piece of shit.  The end is near.  Where's Otto?  Did Otto give up?  They're dropping a deuce.  I want to hear George a little more. 
[03:01:30]  Danny, I got it.  Are you going to be in more movies, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Kevin's going to put me in his next one, he said, his hockey movie.  Right, he's doing one with Mayhem's in Boston right now,  filming for the MMA movie.  What's the MMA movie?  Is he doing an MMA movie?  Yeah.  Because I did that Paul Blart Mall Cop.  I was this bad boy skateboarder guy.  Good gig, man.  Great fucking job.  Greatest job I've ever had.  What's the MMA movie they're doing now?  I don't know.  Just Kevin James has a movie.  Oh, Kevin James.  I mean Kevin Smith.  So it's a comedy.  Jason.  Yeah, it's always a comedy.  I knew you were in Mall Cop. 
[03:02:00]  I couldn't make it to your part.  Yeah, well.  How far in are you?  I am not going to get angry about that at all.  But how far in are you?  I try.  I mean, I'm all over it.  I'm all over it.  When the bad guys show up in the mall, that's when I spark.  I don't think I made it to that point.  Did I see you there?  I have a fight scene with Kevin James.  He beats me up and knocks me out with a tanning boot.  I think I saw part of that.  I remember.  This fucking movie made a shitload.  Number one.  In two weeks in a row.  I know.  I try to sit through it.  We like the other one, Observe and Report. 
[03:02:30]  But for comedy to make the kind of movie Kevin's movies or Adam's movies make, I mean, it  is impressive for any comedy to make that kind of fucking bread.  They don't make that kind of money.  Comedies don't make $120 million or whatever the fuck they make.  It's a kid-friendly movie and that's the key.  It's a fine line because when you start being kid-friendly, for us, it becomes hokey and corny.  It's not funny.  Right.  But when it's funny to us, you're lucky if it's a cult DVD phenomenon.  That's what you're going to be looking for.  Tropic Thunder was a funny fight.  Yeah.  That's like a...  Good guys in that. 
[03:03:00]  High level.  Yeah, very funny.  I like Tropic Thunder.  They took it over the edge, though.  They took it just over the edge.  A guy fucking blowing up in the first 15 minutes of the movie.  Good stuff.  Holding up the guy's skull.  That was funny.  That was Downey Jr.  Yeah.  And Ben Stiller and Pete Jurgens.  Jack Black.  Not a lot of people in that one.  I have a movie.  Did you see The Woodsman?  I did, yeah.  I jerked off to that film.  Did you really watch The Woodsman, or are you lying?  Kevin Smith.  No, no.  No, I have my own movie, The Woodsman.  Oh.  I really...  Oh, it's a different Woodsman?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You mean the pedophile movie you jerked off to, Jimmy? 
[03:03:30]  Just kidding.  Oh.  I was too.  Some guys...  Oh, okay.  I was kind of too.  What's your movie about?  I was...  My movie's about American tourists coming to Australia for a vacation and living and hanging  out in the bush.  And they accidentally stumble upon a man who lives in the wild, The Woodsman, who is a  native to Australia and has a massive erection and a snake in his ass, and he murders them.  Oh.  Slowly but surely, he murders everybody.  One guy, he cuts his arms and legs off, cuts his dick off, puts it in his mouth, and then 
[03:04:00]  shits on him until he dies.  Is it a comedy?  Do you see anything funny about that death scene, Jim?  Absolutely.  Yes.  Dropping a deuce on a body?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Speaking of movies, my movie's actually in the Tribeca Film Festival.  Yeah, Bobby's got a movie in the Tribeca.  Yes, it is.  The one with Burr and DeRosa.  Yes.  A short, I should say.  Why isn't Jimmy in the movie?  He's actually going to be in the feature movie.  It's going to be a feature movie?  We didn't want to waste his time with the short.  I hear I'm invited for this thing. 
[03:04:30]  I want to check it out.  Absolutely, yeah.  When is this going down?  It's going down in two weeks.  When the film festival starts, you can go to TribecaFilmFestival.com.  It's a short movie, right?  Short movie, but it's actually up for awards, so it's in competition.  Damn.  Wow.  It's actually pretty good.  Impressive.  Yeah, TribecaFilmFestival.com or CheatTheMovie.com for information.  I got the number one metal album in Canada, one through five.  Really?  Yeah, my movie didn't do too good, but my band did.  Really?  Jason's got his hands in a lot of shit. 
[03:05:00]  This motherfucker is like the guy...  Taint Stick is the name of the band.  And Death, Death, Die.  No, Death, Death, Die is my new band.  That's the one that's the number one metal album in the country.  Why a different band?  Because I changed the band.  I broke up the band and decided to start a new band because I was bored.  And we weren't really a band anyway.  I just make up bands.  What do you play instrument?  I'm the singer.  I play some guitar as well.  Wait, and it's the number one...  On iTunes, it was the number one metal album in North America.  Then another single came out. 
[03:05:30]  I didn't really...  I just played on my show.  That became number one in Canada.  So then I made a joke.  I should have the number one, two, three metal album in Canada.  And then that became very close.  And then I made a joke before the end of the show.  If it was one through five, I would fly to Canada and do a show there tomorrow.  I woke up in the morning and it's one through five.  So I went to Vancouver the next day and did a show there.  Fucking A.  I got to ask, where's your motivation come from?  Because you're...  I feel like I'm motivated, but you're like obsessively motivated. 
[03:06:00]  Well, I think you probably...  You got your shit...  You've done it.  You're Opie and Anthony.  I'm fucking nobody.  Hold on, hold on.  How old are you?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  39.  You're 39?  Yeah, but you travel the world as a top skateboarder.  That's not a nobody thing.  Yeah, but I blew it.  You did motocross.  I blew it, though.  That's why, I think.  And you want to get back up to that?  I had the chance to be the best skateboarder in the world and I just sort of partied and  fucked everybody and did a bunch of drugs.  Isn't that part of being the best skateboarder on the world?  No.  No, that's a part of being the most fun pro skateboarder in the world. 
[03:06:30]  Tony Hawk didn't do that shit.  No, he didn't.  And he ruled the world.  And to me...  This is a real question because I know there's something there and he's answering it.  Oh, it really is.  No, because I was like, and I saw it, I watched it and I was like, oh my God, people that I  beat are now passing me and now I'm losing stuff.  And then all at the same time, right when that all started to happen, I started to suck.  And that's when I took a job on the radio because I knew that I needed to find, because  a lot of pro skateboarders are like, what are they going to do after?  We can't retire.  We're all 35 when we retire. 
[03:07:00]  How the fuck?  You don't have any money to show.  So I didn't, my agent didn't, I had an agent and a manager and they didn't pay my taxes  for five years.  So I lost my house, lost my skateboard ability, dad died, girlfriend got pregnant.  And I was like, oh, fuck.  This is the, this is the worst thing.  I don't even know if I can.  And then it was like an ultimatum.  It was like, die, go home and die.  Cause you know, I'd done heroin and with hookers and shit, it was a very easy option.  Or you were doing heroin when you were the top skateboard in the world. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  I wasn't the top skateboard in the world.  I was fucking the best mess in the world.  You know, I got top three.  That was the best I did.  But at top three, with occasionally drinking too much and deciding to smoke crack in a light  bulb with a prostitute, that means that I probably could have won.  Right?  I would say so.  I put a theory on it and I blew it.  I lost the, I lost that deal and I'll never get it back.  You lost the edge.  I could, I tried to get back, tried to get sober, tried to get back on it.  And I, and I just knew.  And I passed you by.  Yeah, it's gone.  Couldn't catch.  Are you still a good skateboarder? 
[03:08:00]  On a vert ramp?  Yeah.  There's not many vert.  But I mean like in the street, you can still skateboard around and.  No, you wouldn't be impressed at all.  I've never been a good street skater.  If you went to a ramp that was like a 12 foot high ramp, you'd be like, fucking hell,  this dude's amazing.  You can still do it?  On a ramp?  Fuck yeah.  No, I did it.  I don't, I don't, it's a weird thing.  I'll skate a pool every now and then in Venice.  I skate a pool and I don't like anybody.  If anybody recognizes me, then I immediately become uncomfortable because I'm nowhere near  as good as I was. 
[03:08:30]  And for some reason that competitive attitude, it's a little depressing when I go.  Are there guys there better than you when you go?  I'll go, I'll go to the bowl and skate and then the local will see me and come over and  and fuck me up.  Did you ever go to the one on the West Side Highway, the skating park they have over there?  Nah.  I got a brand new fucking insane skating park.  He doesn't really want to do it anymore.  I fight all the time now.  That's my, my new thing.  I just train every morning.  Oh, you answered the question.  I like that.  Cause you were right there and you lost it all.  And now you're trying to get back to that point.  And now I've got an opportunity to do it again. 
[03:09:00]  And when I first started doing radio, I was like, you know, when I first started skating,  I'm not a talented guy.  I'm not an athletical guy.  I just loved it and did it so much that I got good at it.  So good that I actually could have been the best at it.  And now with radio, I was like, I finally have a fucking talent to start off with.  If I have the talent and the drive that I had from skateboarding, I could make a living  out of this and, and, and, and enjoy my life.  So you're fighting now?  I train every day.  I've had a couple of fights.  I'm going to, my next fight's going to be a Muay Thai fight. 
[03:09:30]  Cause I, I had a boxing fight and then a pro MMA fight.  And now I want to have a Muay Thai fight.  So what is your base?  Boxing?  I'm a boxer for sure.  Yeah.  Boxer for sure.  And now Muay Thai?  I'm trying.  I've sparring Muay Thai now, like a couple of days a week.  And then when the time's right, I'm going to have it.  Cause I, I can't, cause I had a pro MMA fight.  I can't have an amateur Muay Thai fight.  I have to fight pro.  And I, you know, and I'm a boxer and I stand on my front foot.  You know what I mean?  So I have to lean back and keep my elbows in and change my hands.  There's a whole new thing that I'm learning that I need to, I need to know the basis of 
[03:10:00]  the basics of this before I get kicked in the face.  And you have to do a pro fight?  Holy shit.  But that's what it's all about, man.  I got to do it all.  You know, I'm trying to do everything I can before it ends.  Now, um, why did, uh, tough question, I guess.  But why, why did, um, I know why.  I'll just ask you.  What, why, why did your dad's death, uh, fuck you up?  Obviously it's a tough thing to lose your dad.  I guess is what I'm saying.  Let's acknowledge that.  But it seemed like it really fucked you up.  Yeah.  I just didn't think it was going to happen.  Was he a young guy? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, he's 53.  Oh, well, there you go.  I didn't realize that.  We're all hanging out.  And I mean, I see, I see him once a year and we're, last time I saw him, we drank and  partied and he beat me in an arm wrestle and it was a fucking 45 minute arm wrestle and  he beat me.  And I was like, man, dude, still fucking tough as shit.  And then New Year's after New Year's, he's there, I'm in America.  And he decided to, my brother, who's a supercross guy, top 10 in the world, he pedaled on a bike  up the mountain, because we have a house up in the mountain.  And he said it was the toughest thing he's ever done. 
[03:11:00]  My father has no cardio.  He doesn't work out, doesn't exercise.  He pedaled up there at six o'clock in the morning and died of a heart attack at the top of the  mountain.  So it was just, when I heard, it was just, it fucked my chest.  Like when the information came through on the phone, my heart stopped beating right.  It was just the pressure of, I think I'd had such an easy life being a skateboarder, drinking,  doing whatever I want, fly around the world.  And all of a sudden it was like, hey, here comes fucking the real world.  You know, like your family could die and you can be broke and you can be nothing. 
[03:11:30]  All of a sudden you can be nothing, you know?  I didn't realize you were so young.  Well, that's the obvious answer.  You didn't expect that shit.  No one expects that at 53.  But it helped me.  You know, it really did help me.  I was, like I said, a very lazy, spoiled skateboarder, you know, with an attitude against people  that didn't skate.  Like, fuck off.  You know, this guy's a fucking tool.  Everyone's a tool.  Everyone's a fucking moron.  I'm cool.  You're a cocksucker.  You know, that all had to end.  I'm very grateful for it.  All of a sudden I was like, oh, okay.  Normal.  Be normal.  Be nice. 
[03:12:00]  Be considerate to others.  You fucking egotistical cunt.  Well, it's working.  Still a prick.  But, you know, man, I also appreciate it.  You still know how to be a prick.  That's good.  Don't ever lose that.  You're going to need it in this business.  He's got a radio show and his fans fucking eat him up, man.  They're fucking loyal as hell to Jason.  Ellis Mania premieres tomorrow at 10 on Fuel TV.  What's the first episode about?  Is it stuff you already taped that you brought to Fuel TV?  Ellis Mania.  No, I know about Ellis Mania, obviously.  Well, that's what it is.  This show is just about Ellis Mania 6.  So you're bringing all your old tapes. 
[03:12:30]  Oh.  All the fights were filmed by Fuel TV at the Palladium.  Oh, beautiful.  Okay, I didn't know that.  So it's all the fights and all the background of how the fights happened, how Ellis Mania started  back in the day at the gym with like 20 people to the salon out, you know what I mean, like  fucking the joint in Vegas and all that shit.  And then it's just all the fans, interviews with them, some shit in the radio of me beating  people up and all that stuff.  And then really, it's just episodes of fights.  You know what I mean?  The musical chair fight where, you know what I mean, you go, there's like eight people 
[03:13:00]  and they circle a chair when the music stops.  Two people are left.  They have to fight each other.  The winner stays in musical chair.  And somebody becomes famous in this fight because there's this dude who has Rocky Balboa  shorts, big, fat Mexican dude, and he's the greatest fighter I've ever seen for someone  who can't fight.  Really?  And then I fight a band as well.  I fight four people at the same time.  Me and Ant were on to something, but we just blew it off.  We had blind boxing, legit blind guys.  One guy popped his eyes out, I think I told you.  I think I heard that.  And then we had another fight where you had to have one leg. 
[03:13:30]  See, the difference is-  And so two fucking amputees came in and beat the shit out of each other.  They let us do this on regular radio.  We certainly can't even offer this down the hall anymore.  I'm not going to even go there, but you don't fight enough.  I do.  That's the difference.  Alice Mania is I size everybody up.  I mean, accidents can happen, but I make sure that everyone who's fighting everyone  can't kill each other.  Like, I don't have heavyweights.  I don't even care if you've never fought before.  If you're 200 pounds, you're not allowed to be in a real boxing fight. 
[03:14:00]  I'll have a fight with you where you're a blindfolded with a dog collar and I'll electrocute  you, and you'll fight me because I know that I can take that punch and you can also handle  it.  Yeah.  But these other guys are usually littler guys and I organize.  Like, when I fought the band, it was four dudes against me.  I didn't punch the dude to kill him.  I just punched him to make him fall over.  That's a difference.  It is.  Hey, man, if you box enough, you can give, you know, 45%, 75%.  Right.  You just got to control it. 
[03:14:30]  That's why if you fight wild people, that's when you get hurt.  Doesn't it feel good to punch somebody, though?  You know what feels great?  Fighting the band, because I always train with people that are way better than me.  So my life is, I lose constantly, and then I go to Alice Mania and I fight four guys who  are, you know, they're adults, they pay taxes.  Right.  And I made them look like fucking toddlers.  Felt good, right?  No, felt good, yeah.  I'm not going to lie.  People are wondering why Otto's so quiet.  I don't know.  He's not here.  He left.  Where'd he go?  We don't know.  Is this back to the old days?  Why'd he leave?  Is he doing a bump in the bathroom? 
[03:15:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  The old days, he would freak out and just leave our show.  For what?  I don't know.  Maybe, I don't know what's going on.  Sam!  Where did Otto go?  Is this his old school Otto, or is something really going on?  He would take off during our NAW show.  Yeah, he went and did his next interview, and then he's taking off.  He just leaves?  Yeah, he just took off.  He didn't really do anything yet on our show.  I thought he did great at the start.  Where'd he go?  He went to go do his interview with Steve Sterniolo.  Oh, God.  Who the fuck is Steve Sterniolo?  He does comedy for my house. 
[03:15:30]  He works for Raw Dog.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  I don't know who he is, so.  He's a creep.  Wasn't he still doing our show?  No, he was done.  What do you mean he was done?  He didn't even start.  He was mad at himself that he let his Elizabeth Taylor joke go too early, he told me.  It was a good joke.  He said it was a good joke, but like.  Well, the setup fucked everybody up, because we were laughing at the setup, because the setup  was so twisted.  I think the setup was just good by itself, really.  Yeah, and then the punchline was certainly top notch.  But it got a big laugh.  But he was pissed that he did it early in the appearance instead of later, and then that's 
[03:16:00]  it.  And then he went and did his next interview.  He wanted to close with it?  I guess he wanted to do it a little later.  No, seriously, though, that's a good game plan.  Say that joke and leave.  I would have been impressed.  But nobody would think that.  Like, he just did the line.  He had the greatest 30 seconds, I guess.  He should have said, thank you, good night after.  It's just fucking O&A.  You don't fucking close.  You just talk.  At NAW, he used to do this all the time.  He would have a panic.  Something would happen.  I don't want to speak for him, and he would just run away.  Uh-huh.  Panic attacks.  I'm thinking. 
[03:16:30]  I just saw stupid Bob trying to use his folded up triangle magnet, and then he tried  to, like, be cool and, like, throw roll it, close, and then fucking skid it across the  screen.  Oh, I know why, though.  Yeah, because you're a dope.  Good.  There's too much going on with that.  I don't want to deal with magnets for a cover for the iPad.  Boom, scat.  I love the way he just tried to, he just tried to do it, roll it, like, unroll it and  close it.  What, what, what, what?  Right.  But it skid it.  I said boom, scat.  Yeah, but he got all our attention, because he wanted to show.  Somebody's choking on his own fucking jokes. 
[03:17:00]  Are you going to be in tomorrow?  Yes, I will.  I work when I'm sick.  Hey, I'm having a party tomorrow night if you want to go.  Yay!  Yay!  Parties!  I like parties.  I have a hat.  Yay!  Yay!  You guys are fucking excited.  You should have said that.  We love parties.  We're going to party tonight.  Where is it?  At Epstein Bar.  Tomorrow?  Yeah, tomorrow.  For the TV show.  Everyone's going to watch the TV show.  And we're going to, the band's going to show up.  I don't think I have enough tattoos for a fucking party.  I got two.  Do you have enough tattoos?  He's all tatted up.  You don't have enough tattoos. 
[03:17:30]  And what's the one under your arm again?  I got to see that again.  Oh, backflip bitch.  Kerry Hawk did it.  Wait, did Otto have to wait over an hour?  I just got my whole back tattoo.  He was here for over an hour?  He's riding you, he's mad?  No, Kenny's riding me.  He said Otto waited for over an hour.  I'm asking why he left.  I guess Sam.  He was here for over an hour?  He was here, I don't know if it was over an hour, but it was close.  He was scheduled for 8.30.  He got here early.  He got here at like 8.  So he got, all right, and then we were doing the Jesse Ventura shit. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, I didn't know he was here.  He probably technically waited 15 minutes, you know, if he's scheduled for 8.30.  Oh, I didn't, I had no idea he was here.  Like he, Jason was waiting too, but I'm like, we're doing Jesse Ventura.  It's a tough spot to just throw people in the mix right now.  I don't mind waiting.  I'm not complaining at all.  It's great to be here.  Love the show.  I didn't know he had all the shit going on.  Thanks for having me.  Right away.  We could get out of here ourselves.  We'll probably play.  I'll be in Columbus this weekend, Friday, Saturday.  The Funny Bone have never been there.  So if you want to get tickets, I guess go to ColumbusFunnyBone.com.  You think we have fans up there still? 
[03:18:30]  I know, from the back of the regular radio.  I've actually been there, and a lot of ONA fans showed up.  And they kept asking for when the fuck you were going to get out.  And go to AntisocialComedy.com.  Connecticut's sold out.  Fox was sold out.  But DC and the opening night of the Chicago Festival are on sale, and Vegas is going on sale this weekend.  How many dates do you think you're going to end up doing?  I don't know, honestly.  We have three more planned.  Connecticut plus three more, plus another city I'm not announcing yet.  So we have five more planned.  Jesus.  Hopefully a bunch. 
[03:19:00]  How do you feel about doing comedy all the time and doing this show and grinding yourself to death?  You good with that?  I am.  It's fun.  It's not once in a while the traveling wears on you.  I get sick a lot lately because I'm fucking on planes all the time.  But it's a fun gig, man.  Ever thought of getting shots in your ass of the vitamin B?  B-12?  Yeah.  If you get them regularly, like once a month, it helps.  B-12 is supposed to be very good.  That I would do, sure.  I mean, a vitamin.  There's a place in California where you get a fucking smoothie and some hot bitch will just shove it in your ass.  Really? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Maybe I don't know if she puts it on a strap on.  What?  Does that shit work?  Yeah.  Because for a while there when I would train for the fights and do the radio,  because the L is made the last one, I had to train for the fights, make the album, rehearse the album,  because we had to play, the band played after the fights,  and then the radio and the fucking website and all this other drama.  So the whole time I would train, every time I would train in the morning,  I would feel like I'm getting sick for the radio show.  And that chick was just injecting me the whole time.  How often were you going for the injection?  I would get like every three weeks she would put it in there. 
[03:20:00]  Does it last for more than a week when you get it?  No.  Sort of like a, I mean, it'll help your immune system, but you feel better for like two days.  You really do?  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  I should try that shit.  I should too.  I should just fucking do it like a heroin addict.  Let's try that shit.  You should get someone in here to inject you.  You could do that.  I was going to get on my show.  I'd let Dr. Steve do it.  Huh?  You're hiding.  We can't do it.  Dude, how is it that you can't do it?  I tried it.  The last time I was here, I tried to get a tattoo on the radio,  because I get tattooed on the radio all the time.  And they were like, there's no way that guy's coming up here and tattoo. 
[03:20:30]  And I was like, okay, I'll see you later.  We used to pierce clits on regular radio.  I saw a video of you doing a radio show where a guy leaned back and another guy vomited over his face.  That was a K-Rock.  That was on regular radio.  You used to stick a wiffle ball back.  All right.  Well, yeah.  Up the asshole, too.  No, you didn't.  Oh, fuck yeah, we did.  You've got to be happy with the work.  I mean, you've done it, though.  You know?  It's frustrating when you can't do it anymore.  That's sort of where I'm at now.  You're right, because it'll drive you nuts.  But we did more on regular radio at this point, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  You can't even do a tattoo on the radio?  I can do it in Cali.  We did that as a throwaway bit.  Right.  A quick tattoo here.  Fuck.  But you know what?  I get the baby bird, by the way, you brought up, which is one of the fucking most amazing  things I've ever seen doing this radio show.  Joe Rogan set it up for us, by the way.  He's the king.  We can't do that anymore.  That was an annual bit.  The eggnog drinking contest.  I'm very lucky.  I get to...  You're under the radar still, but barely.  I just beat the fuck out of everybody down there.  And you're in L.A. 
[03:21:30]  Who's watching you there?  No one's going to stop me.  Over on the left coast, I like to call it.  That's right.  I'm not going to stop.  I'm not going to let anybody push me around.  Don't want to stop you, because you know what?  It might be too late for me.  Oh, leave.  It might be too late for me, Jason.  But there will be a lot of other places that will allow you to do your shit.  That is a very, very...  Yeah, I'm not worried about it.  I've never really...  There was a time there where I was like, hey, you guys, hey, you guys, look at me.  Pay attention.  And now I'm resourceful.  I'm like, all right.  You're not going to do it.  I'll do it.  So now if they want to help or they want to tag along, I'm very happy for them to do 
[03:22:00]  that, but I've got plans, and it doesn't involve anybody.  I regret we didn't do a lot of that stuff on our own without using these people.  I regret that to this day.  You still have a great show.  No, no.  We're still kicking.  It's like I say in my new book.  It's just different.  That's all.  My new book, Swinging for the Fences.  You really have to just do what it is you do.  We've been able to adjust.  Forward by Sully, the pilot.  You know what? 
[03:22:30]  This business has fucked up a lot of guys.  They weren't able to fucking adjust.  They're long gone, and they were fucking big names, but they couldn't adjust to the  new rules.  The new rules made it unbearable.  The regular radio, at the end, it was fucking hideous.  I hated everybody who worked at that station.  They hated us.  I have an ounce of respect for them.  The lawyers, the fucking...  The lawyers were the worst.  But even Chisano, who I liked, but he wasn't going to fight for us.  He didn't like me.  I didn't fuck all those guys.  He didn't like you?  Nah, fuck all those guys. 
[03:23:00]  I'm going to write them right now and ask them.  He'll lie, but he didn't hate me on a personal level, but he didn't like me on the show.  They wanted me fired.  Fuck regular radio.  I really hate them.  I feel like, to me, it's a business, and their business is to try to look busy and pay  you as little amount as possible.  That's their business.  So I don't hate them for trying to sell me short.  Their job is...  But they're going to lose a lot of creative people.  That's not my problem.  No, I know.  But that's why they're not being smart about it. 
[03:23:30]  They're going to lose a lot of people.  But isn't radio like a cycle, like anything else?  It's about to reinvent.  Yeah, it comes back.  It's about to reinvent.  Yes, there's a lot of places that...  Change good or change bad?  Good.  They're going to need content now.  It's been bad for a fucking while.  They're going to need content.  There was a lull in the action, but it's ready to explode again.  Radio.  Not regular radio.  It's going to be other places.  Like, maybe Netflix takes it on.  I don't fucking know.  You're saying some sort of internet bullshit.  Or maybe Apple fucking does it.  Whatever.  Maybe it's podcast shit that everyone's doing.  How do you feel about that?  All the time.  Talent rules. 
[03:24:00]  All the fucking time.  Here we go.  That's the name of Jimmy's new book?  No, no, no.  Radio is a conduit.  I don't know what that means.  It's a means of delivering one thing.  Theraflu is kicking in flow to another.  Everybody step back.  Here we go.  What did you say, Bob?  Talent rules.  Right.  Spoken like a true idiot.  Don't fuck yourself, you sleepy cunts.  Talent rules.  I was told that talent rules also. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, but that's the type of thing you yell with your fist up in the air in the lunchroom  as you're being fired.  Talent rules.  That's right.  Take this job and shove it.  This weekend.  Go ahead, David Allen.  Call.  Read your plugs.  Go, Bobby.  Laughing Skull.  Atlanta Comedy Festival.  The Laughing Skull.  If I was a skull, I would have screwed it up.  I fucking hate shit.  Friday, one show.  Saturday, two shows.  And the film festival is Tribeca Film Festival.  Check it out if you guys want to go check out the short film, Me, Bill, Aaron, Joe.  And Jason Ellis. 
[03:25:00]  Elizabeth Taylor's cunt.  Premieres tomorrow at 10 on film TV.  I'm not really a comedian.  Just ripping somebody off.  And the Jason Ellis show is Monday through Thursday, 3 p.m.  Fridays, 9 a.m.  On Faction Series 28XM52.  You can go to my website as well and pay me because that's where I make my real money.  Smart.  Between the fans and me, there's no middleman.  You're out.  That's smart.  You can put your dick in my ass all day with no lube.  I'm going to keep on sucking some dick because I love the fans.  That's a gay metaphor.  Don't worry about it.  I didn't fucking... 
[03:25:30]  I was fucking...  I'm trying...  Look, everyone's trying to fuck me in the ass.  Everybody's like, here we go.  Fucking you in the ass.  Fucking you in the ass.  I used to be like, oh, fuck, shit, that hurts.  What the fuck did I do?  I'm trying to suck the world's cock over here.  Make everyone happy.  Why are you fucking me in the ass?  Wait your turn.  Now, from training my ass, no problem.  Fuck it.  I'm sucking the world's cock with a big smile on my face.  You're all welcome.  Tune into the Jason Ellis Show today.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Jesus.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.
