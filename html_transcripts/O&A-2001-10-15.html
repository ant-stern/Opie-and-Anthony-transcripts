<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a celebratory tone, acknowledging their #1 ranking in the 18-49 demographic in both New York and Philadelphia, planning a celebratory cake in Philadelphia the following Wednesday. This celebratory mood was quickly shattered by a heated discussion regarding a negative interaction with Melissa, contrasted with a dismissive and derogatory discussion of Patty.  The hosts engaged in angry outbursts and insults directed at both women.  A drunken Frenchman was present in the studio throughout much of the show.

The show then shifted to a discussion about the repossession of their Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga arcade game due to a lack of promotion.  They discussed their attempts to get a replacement, and the contributions of Big Mike, who had provided and serviced both the foosball table and the arcade game. This transitioned into a humorous anecdote recounted by Doug about a car ride home with Bubba Ray Dudley and his girlfriend, involving a police escort, Doug's severe car sickness, and him ending up in the girlfriend's lap.  A call from Tim Sabian, program director of WYSP, further cemented their Philadelphia success.

The broadcast also featured a significant segment on Opie's self-proclaimed "sports curse," highlighted by incorrect predictions of Yankees and Islanders victories, sparking numerous listener calls and discussions.  This segment also included a caller's anecdote about his Uncle Tom's outrageous ticket requests and flamboyant shirts, along with a humorous description of rink-side ice-removal personnel evolving from a single old man with a shovel to four women in revealing outfits.  The discussion veered into various tangential conversations, including comparisons of bodily odors, Opie's and Anthony's experiences losing their virginity, and numerous off-color jokes and references.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a lengthy discussion about gastric bypass surgery, featuring two men who had undergone the procedure and a female caller sharing her experience.  The conversation included detailed descriptions of the surgery, recovery, and resulting lifestyle changes, along with frank discussions about weight, body image, and eating habits.  Other segments included a discussion of Stephen Lynch's show in D.C. and the audience's reaction to his explicit material; Opie’s purported ability to guess a woman’s age from her genitalia; and an "unbelievably horrible" prank call where Opie falsely informed a woman that her friend had died.  The show also included a French chef, "Frenchie," who engaged in banter with the hosts, resulting in comments about his culinary and radio skills.  Further discussions involved Bob Hope and Mike Tyson.

A segment covered the hosts' appearance on WWF XS, detailing their interaction with Kurt Angle and the show's portrayal of the event.  This transitioned into an extended discussion of Mike Tyson's recent fight, featuring clips of post-fight interviews with Tyson's opponent, peppered with the hosts' crude and sexually charged commentary.  A call from Melissa, promoting her show, included a humorous bit about fans showing up with clothing bearing the hosts’ and Melissa’s names.  This led to a discussion about fan enthusiasm and Melissa's experience. The segment also involved a discussion about penis size.  A contentious interaction with Frenchy, marked by insults and vulgarity, resulted in his temporary departure from the studio before his return.  Anthony’s departure was also discussed, with Frenchy selected as his replacement.  Commercial breaks featured ads for Stacker 2 and O2Go.  The show also included several songs by John Valby, focusing on Osama Bin Laden, interspersed with more jokes about Bob Hope and insults directed at Frenchy.

Listener calls throughout the show provided various anecdotes, ranging from humorous to offensive, often relating to sports, personalities, and clothing. One caller mentioned a cancelled cake being replaced with a giant Pop-Tart.  The show concluded with a giveaway of a Samsung DVD/VCR combo and a "Boogeyman" DVD, sponsored by Samsung, followed by closing banter and thanks to the drunken French guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious amusement and outright horror  It's absolutely disgusting  It's awful  Filth and smith  It's really bad, but it's really good  The Opie and Anthony Show  Truly tasteless and not funny 
[00:00:30]  What are you, gay?  Uh, no  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show  Ah, yes  Another week  Couple phone numbers real fast in the New York area  877-692-1027  Anywhere else, including  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, baby 
[00:01:00]  Philly  866-277-4WOW  Who's loving Philly?  We're loving Philly today  We'll tell you in a few minutes why  Maybe we can get Tim Sabian on the line  But the phone number, 866-277-4WOW  I don't think so  I think Tim is probably very busy right now  Just looking at certain pieces of paper  And cranking it  That's probably where Tim is  I don't think he has time to get to a phone  His hands down, his pants 
[00:01:30]  Pleasuring himself  Tim's at a bar celebrating right now  Is that what he's doing?  He took the afternoon off  He doesn't have to work anymore  Right  He's considered a genius in the industry, I guess  Holy F  What a guy  Well, there's so much going on  Anthrax  Yankee baseball  Yes  Still rolling  Shoot it  But I want to start with the most important story of the day  More important than Anthrax  More important than the Islanders losing 
[00:02:00]  And the Yankees winning  Someone's smiling with a bundle of cash in their hands  Going, it works!  It works!  It is a short thing  Alright, we'll explain a little bit  And of course, we got Tyson to talk about  Bob Hope  Tom Brokaw  Yeah  But I need to start with something that is close and dear to my heart  I hope it's nothing serious, like Anthrax or something, no?  Our Ms. Pac-Man machine was repoed  Yes 
[00:02:30]  We were on our way to having a really cool game room outside the studio  That during commercials, we would run out and play some games  We have the foosball table, of course  Which is working fine  And we're all loving it  And we had a little thing going with the video games  We had a combination Ms. Pac-Man-Galaga game  Oh, can I interrupt?  Because I forgot  Doug's got something here  Doug, what's up?  What's up?  How was your weekend, buddy?  It was good  We'll talk about the weekend  But talk about what you have on the screen there  I hope  All I want to know is 
[00:03:00]  After Bubba Ray dropped you off  Did he have to keep his hand out the window for four hours on the way home?  Oh!  Wow, that's a great obscure reference  Woo!  Alright, guys  I forgot that Bubba drove you home  Of course, you're referring way back to my girlfriend from the Geneseo day  Yes  All I know is Bubba said I'm having some man sex  No, he was  You never want to say Bubba drove me home  I don't know, it doesn't sound right  Bubba drove me home with his knockout  Did he give you the OP cutter?  Knockout girlfriend  What? 
[00:03:30]  Did he give you the OP cutter?  No, no  I'll explain what happened  How about the 3D, buddy?  No, nothing happened  One more thing  Way to go there, O for one  I don't know what Doug's talking about  What happened?  So after the show Friday  Bubba Ray goes  Hey man, I'm going back to the island  You want to ride home?  Yeah  He's a Long Island boy  I'm like, cool  Gets to, you know, tool around with Bubba Ray for a little while  And his girlfriend  I'm like, no problem  We get outside the building  And there's a couple cops there  I hope I don't get anyone in trouble  But he gets a police escort all the way to the tunnel 
[00:04:00]  Really?  I was like Mayor Giuliani  Or like when the president comes to me  Right, right  You get that  How was the dick?  They help you out  So this limo is zigzagging in and out of just packed traffic to the tunnel  Someone's going to get in trouble  You know, I should keep my mouth shut  Well, it was a very important mission  Bubba Ray had to get to dinner  Bubba Ray had to get to dinner  He's a great guy, by the way  And his girlfriend's cool  I got so freaking car sick from that limo ride  Really?  That at one point I'm on Bubba Ray's girlfriend's lap 
[00:04:30]  Oh, you're going to say you're on Bubba Ray's lap  I'm like, what the hell is happening in that limo?  No, because I'm sitting backwards from the driver, you know what I mean?  In that seat  That's the death seat in any limo  I don't care  I hate limos  It's the vomit seat  It's the vomit seat  If you get car sick, yeah  Because you're backwards  But if you're going to be in a limo  You want to sit facing forward, obviously  All the way in the back  I'm facing backwards  I'm getting sicker and sicker and sicker  It's getting close where I'm going to have to boot 
[00:05:00]  On the Long Island Expressway somewhere  If you puke in Bubba Ray's limo  We will never live it down  So I had an option  Because there was a point where I thought I was going  And I could either jump on Bubba Ray's lap  Or take my chances and jump on Bubba Ray's girlfriend's lap  Which could probably be more dangerous  That's what I had to figure out in my mind  So I went for Bubba Ray's girlfriend's lap, obviously  You went for Bubba Ray's lap  And I'm pretty much leaning over out the window  Yeah  But thank God I did not puke 
[00:05:30]  You didn't boot  No  But I was nauseous the rest of the night  What's Bubba Ray got in the limo?  Is it like the beers or anything?  Or is it just strictly a ride?  It was a pretty mellow ride  Yeah  It was WWF superstars calling him every ten seconds  Oh, are they?  That's what they do?  They just drive around  Paul Hyman or whatever his name is  Paul Hyman  Paul, the new announcer  Yeah  He's pissed at us because we said how great Taz is  No, no Taz  Jerry the King  Jerry the King was great  And we want the King back 
[00:06:00]  Who doesn't want the King back?  Paul, you know, took over for the King  So he's like, ah, tell him thanks  Thanks for the props  I think he's a good guy  But it's no Jerry the King law or chemistry between him and J.R.  That's all  So he wants to come back on the show  Well, he's never been on the show  He wants to come on the show to, you know, defend himself  None of Hef's chicks in the limo?  Seems they like going off with any other guy they can find other than Hef's shriveled old schlong  No?  Okay  So, no, Bubba Ray did not have to have his hand out after the limo ride 
[00:06:30]  Of course, Doug referred back to my girlfriend  Yeah  In college when I was going to school in Geneseo  Who hadn't had a girl like that at some point in their life  Where you get done with the night's festivities  And on the way home, you're just like, wow  What is that?  This hand has to be water  And that doesn't even work  Soap and water doesn't even work  You know, there's some ladies out there  Are we allowed to say they just plain stink?  A pungent  Yeah 
[00:07:00]  Are you allowed to say they just plain stink?  It's a pungent, lasting odor  There's a lovely, lovely odor  And then there's one that is, oh my God  And hey, I'm sure it's no pleasure  When some girl's got to have her nose under a yam bag  You know what I mean?  I'm sure that isn't the most fragrant of ever  Don't care  Is that how you looked in the limo?  He's gagging  There's no Bubba's girlfriend's lap in here  Yeah, I'm sure that's not a treat  Paul Heyman, thank you  You know  Nice order of onion rings  Right 
[00:07:30]  So, I was going out with this girl  Onion rings soaked in musk  And I was a freshman  And it was early in my sex life  Right  Still trying to figure out what women were all about  What they're made up of  Sure  Sugar and spice  Unlike Anthony who lost his virginity at 14  Because his dad brought a girl home for him  Thank you, pops  I had to kind of work it out on my own  And it took until I was 18 to lose my virginity  To this girl  So, the first one I ever had  Stunk  Almost turning you off to girls 
[00:08:00]  Thinking that they all smelled like that  Or what?  At the time, I was thinking  What the hell is this?  Oh my God  They're all going to be this awful  So, I'm doing the little  Well, it's a visual  But  It looks like you're pointing  Pointing, pointing, pointing  Yeah, yeah  We're pointing with two fingers  He's pointing at something  I'm just pointing  And  Right  Where is it?  There, there, there, there, there  Right  It looks like you're pushing a button repeatedly  With two fingers  So, it was  It was the day before Thanksgiving break  For Geneseo 
[00:08:30]  So, I was  Pointing  All night long  Pointing  Pointing  Right  Because she wanted to save her virginity  For a while  Anyway  Oh, so you never  No, that's why the  The pointing  And that's why the  Did you get the final action  Happy ending  During that situation?  Oh, yeah  Okay  For me  And that was  Oh, but  Did you have the basic  Sexual act 
[00:09:00]  That they call it?  Or was she still a virgin when you left?  No, no, virgin  Oh, really?  That's why  Oh, that's why you're pointing, pointing, pointing  Right  I thought that was just to get it all ready  You gotta foam the runway  If you're going like that  Use the sparks from flying up  That's a lot  But, dude, you did a thing where you went  Oh, yeah  Was that you?  Oh, my God  Yeah  You did that, too?  You went down south of the border?  Yeah, because I just figured all girls  You know  Wow  Yeah  So, did you have to hang your tongue out the window? 
[00:09:30]  That's why I was so depressed  I'm like, they're all like this?  This sucks  When did you notice?  Was it at the equator?  At the Tropic of Capricorn?  Where was it as you started going down south  That you noticed?  Uh-oh  Something's amiss  Pretty much at the belly button  Yeah  Was it the belly button level?  Wow  And it walked up to that height  Oh, my God  No, no joke  This girl was bad  I was so bundling  Man, if this is what it's all about  I might  I might have to try to play for the other team 
[00:10:00]  Because something's wrong here  Right  But thank God  It was her  And I was able to move on  Yeah  But, so, all night long  And push my buttons  Right  Mm-hmm  So, then I have an eight-hour ride from Geneseo to Long Island  Yeah  And my hand  It  Can I say it stunk so bad  That I had to hold it out the window for eight straight hours?  Sure  Sure  Right?  Stinky pinky  Stinky digits  That's after cleaning it with all sorts of products  Mm-hmm  Nothing would work  So, here I am, all the way 
[00:10:30]  With my hand outside the window  You need the pumice-cleaning strength of lava  I think that might help  The weird thing, though  Do the individual finger watch  Yeah  I have to do that one  The weird thing about this girl, though  When I finally broke up with her  And went out with, quote, normal girls  Yeah  My bad breath went away  So, that's a good sign  Thank God for that  We all get a hold of one like that  Yeah  I had one after work one time  We had worked in a retail store together  And she came over after a ten-hour shift 
[00:11:00]  Wow  True  On her feet all day  Pantyhose  Probably the worst collector of bacterial fragrance  Like a convection oven in there  Yeah, yeah  Just cooking, making soup  I never forget her breath  Kissing her  It smelled like a kernel of corn  Was in the pit of her stomach  It was just the weirdest odor  Oh  And I swear to God  I'm going  Right  Like the toe-webbing of the Sasquatch  The worst odor  I physically 
[00:11:30]  You know, they usually do smell Sasquatch before you even see them  They all say  I smelt this horrific odor  Then I saw the Sasquatch  Same thing, right?  Yeah, they were making plaster prints on my chin  It was disgusting  Shaky video  The whole thing  Yeah, so  Moving backwards  That's what Doug was referring to  When he said  Did Bubba Ray have his fingers  Or his hand out the window  The whole ride  Oh my God  There you have it  But so getting back to the  The Ms. Pac-Man machine 
[00:12:00]  What happened?  What I'm hearing  Can someone explain what happened?  They repoed our Ms. Pac-Man  Yeah, we were trying to get a good game room going  Like I said, we got the foosball table  And then we got this Ms. Pac-Man Galaga combo game  Which people enjoyed playing when the foosball table was taken up  And then it's gone  I was loving going retro  Going back in time  Playing a little Ms. Pac-Man before the show  A lot of competition going on  People with the high scores and stuff  Stinky thinking he was the king of the game  Well, Stinky is the king of the game  Get him in here 
[00:12:30]  Because I was getting really frustrated  Because I couldn't get the high score  And I'm like, what the hell  My Ms. Pac-Man skills are pretty good  And then I go to Stinky  And he goes, dude  The reason you can't get the high score  Is because Earl's been cheating the whole time  Earl cheats the whole time  And sits here after the show  How does he cheat?  You can keep continuing the game  Because Stinky didn't have it on non-continued  No, you've got to put it on  You just get your allotment of Ms. Pac-Man  We can't put it on anything  Because they took it away  We can't put it on anything  It's gone  Once we finally figured out how to not continue  They take it away  So Earl was cheating the whole time 
[00:13:00]  And they were driving us nuts  Gee, what a surprise that is  The high score was like 250 million  Some ridiculous score  It would take you well over an hour and a half  To get up there  So somebody came in  While we were away  What, over the weekend?  No, just today  Today came in with a hand truck  Dude, they repoed it  Right in front of our eyes  Just like they do with your cars  Oh  You're home and there's nothing you can do  You're watching your car get hooked up to the tow truck  And they're wheeling it out right in front of us  And I'm like  But what?  But it's our game 
[00:13:30]  What happened?  I was just praying  So why did it  Oh no  So why did it get repoed?  What happened?  The guy that owned the game would call up and say that he wanted more plugs  Was that it?  We didn't give enough mentions to the game?  I don't even think we plugged it once  I don't think we did  But let me tell you  We did it a couple times when the guy who brought it by, Mike, was here  We enjoyed it  And maybe we should have said a little more about how much fun it was to play, Opie 
[00:14:00]  Maybe that was our mistake  Too little too late  It's like that's almost like when you write out that check to the car company  They don't take your car away  You know?  When you're playing a Ms. Pac-Man  And you're not sending in your payments  You're going to repo it on  And then he's like  Well this is a money making machine or something  We were all playing for free  You didn't even have to put quarters in the damn thing to play  He was just like  Yeah, I could send it to, you know, a roller rink  And it'd be getting money or something 
[00:14:30]  Oh, so it's all about the money  Couldn't we make a deal with him where we would pay for our games  And then he would just collect that money?  Well, that's insane  Why?  It's a quarter  Who's got quarters right here?  It's better than having a big empty space where there was a game that we all enjoyed  Yeah, it's lonely now back in that corner  I was walking around lost  It looks like your apartment when you're moving  And you're just ready to take out the last thing  And you look around and it's all depressing  There's a square  There's a square on the rug  And it looks like a brand new piece of rug 
[00:15:00]  And all around that square is the dusty rug  Every time I see an apple or a pretzel I break into tears  And where was Pete?  Pete just allowed them to take the game right in front of our eyes?  Well, Pete played the last and final game  He played the last game  That's it  It's all over  I know there's a lot to talk about today  But I'm really bummed that they repoed him as Pac-Man machine  He couldn't even play foosball  Because he kept looking over into the corner going 
[00:15:30]  I know, it's distracting now  It is important with what's going on in the world  To be, you know, with the Pac-Man machine  I'm glad we're covering that  To be entertained  Well, maybe we can get a line on another one  What can I say?  It was Pac-Man slash Galaga  I know, where are you going to find that?  We'll do better next time  I'm sorry, we'll do better next time  It was a nice combo game  Yeah  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going? 
[00:16:00]  Alright  Hey, I went to wrestling on MSG last Sunday  Actually, yesterday  And Bubba Ray never showed the book  You really thought he was going to show that?  Are you crazy?  That hose book?  Hey, hey, hey  I'm not complaining  She did it for the show  Man, Bubba Ray was winking at us  When he said  No, but seriously  In the ring  I'll show your book to everybody  And she was under the impression  That it was going to be  A televised event  And  Hey, get out of here  But it was a good show  Yesterday, man  Yeah, I heard it was  Thanks, Mike  It was a very good show 
[00:16:30]  Later  Thank you  Let me go to Steve  No, no  Steve, alright  The person we want to go to hung up  Alright  Why don't we take a quick break, Anthony  Okay  Ms. Pac-Man is gone  We've lost Ms. Pac-Man  Repoed right in front of our eyes  Repoed  No one explained to Ann and I  That we needed to plug this guy  We were throwing a plug out  Every once in a while  Craig says  I have Ms. Pac-Man  In an Asteroids game 
[00:17:00]  Oh  You know  I gotta say  I loved Asteroids  The original  How you doing?  There was no logic  Hold on  Hold on  Uh-oh  There was no logic to Asteroids  Sure there was  That was very strategic  Hold on  You go into hyperspace  Whatever  And it pops you on the screen  In the middle of a situation  You can't control  That was if you were completely F'd  You would use the hyperspace  If you had the big asteroid  Just colliding in on you  It was like your escape route  But there was a way to play  Nine out of five when you hit that button  You were done anyway  Nine out of five when you hit that button  If you hit it 
[00:17:30]  That's true  Indiscriminately you would die  You would materialize  In an even worse situation  But I always had respect for the guys  That could fly that thing around  And shoot  Because I was one of the  Leave it in the middle  Rotate and shoot guys  Because if I try to move it  I'd get to the point where it's  Going off the right side of the screen  Coming in the left side of the screen  Until I lose track of it  And wham  I'm done  You're a play of the ships  Why your retro rockets my ass  You're a play of the ships  Where you leave one rock  And then just go up and down the screen  Because the ships come out  And wait for the  The flying saucer things 
[00:18:00]  I enjoyed the asteroids  Real fast too  Scott Columbo  Our computer guy here  Yeah  He goes dude  I'll bring in my  My Ms. Pac-Man  You know computer game for you  Wrong  How am I going to play that  With a mouse  Yeah it doesn't work  Or the arrow keys  Yeah  No I have  It's not the same  What do you got Craig  I have the Ms. Pac-Man  Not the combo with the Galaga  I've seen that at arcades  But if you want just the Ms. Pac-Man  Or the asteroids  Okay my brother and I  Are huge fans  We'll be more than happy  To throw in the van  And bring it down for you guys 
[00:18:30]  Is it a real Ms. Pac-Man game  No it's the real Ms. Pac-Man  From 1981  It has this thing on it  It's the real one  But it's not the combo  Like they came out with that  A number of years later  Right  You can switch between the two  That's not the one we have  I don't need the combo  I just need Ms. Pac-Man  If you just want the Ms. Pac-Man  It's the real one we have  Hold on hold on  It's not the Ms. Pac-Man  Where the Ms. Pac-Man  Gets as big as the screen right  No  No it's the one  Remember they took it too far  That sucked  Yeah  There was Pac-Man  Ms. Pac-Man  And then they went

Alternative lifestyle  Pac-Person  Yeah  Pac-Person  But the Pac-Man  Was like a  It was this big  Huge  No this is the one you'd remember  It was like as big as a hockey puck  Yeah that sucked  Twice everything  A mule would come out  And the thing would gobble it  No my brother and I  Would be more than happy  To put it in a truck  And then ran five  It's not the one you want  Which it absolutely is  We're the ones  That'll be taking it out  What do you need though  I mean  Are you going to repo it in a month  Like this other clown?  No it's one that I had bought 
[00:19:30]  Five eight years ago  Because like you  I like the classic games  I'm not looking for anything for it  We're big fans of the show  Look at C  Just because he's a fan of the show  Can we talk to the guy  That repored the original  Ms. Pac-Man game?  What was his problem?  Yeah I think I got his  We could have worked with him  Uh Craig  Yeah we'd be interested  I agree  Well just put me in touch  With somebody who I can contact  With the show  Hey there's no anthrax on it  Is there?

[00:20:00]  You want asteroids also?  That might be a lot  That might be a lot  For these guys though  No room  Why'd you buy these games?  I bought them off of a guy  You know when the video game industry  Started to go down  Because everybody had  Home computer games  Yeah  These are guys  And what they do  Is they put them in arcades  They split the money  And these guys were hurting badly  So they were willing to take  Any amount of money  So I think I paid  400 for asteroids  And I think he won  Like 650 for Ms. Pac-Man  At the time  So for a thousand bucks

[00:23:00]  A couple great instant feedbacks coming in  First of all  Did Mad Max get the repo  Of the Miss Pac-Man live on the air  Mad Max  The Mad Max had a radio show  In Fort Myers  He had the repo man  Right  And when the guy was repoing cars  They did it live on Mad Max's show  Actually I like that  Who are you?  That was a good fit  A-hole  No I like that fit  That's a good one  Especially when the guy was getting chased  By a guy with a gun  That fit definitely has potential 
[00:23:30]  Paul Scorch  And then Dan writes  I hope there were no black lights  In the place where Bubba Ray went  Into after dropping Opie off  That's another college story  Wow  You ever hear this one?  This might be worth telling too  So I worked at  The Inbetween and  GJ's in Genesea  I'm doing little local references  Because we're now heard in that area  Jim  Keeping it local  I was a fig  At Genesea  Oh fig 
[00:24:00]  Phi Sigma Epsilon  Ah  Anyway  I was the DJ  For the bars down there  In Genesea  And I drove my Honda  To the bar  And I was with this girl  That I was with  I guess  I guess we were hanging out  Happy hour  Just getting snotted  And it was time for me to work  But beforehand  I decided to rub one out  With her  Can I say that?  Ooh  That's a good thing  You said with her  Oh I rubbed out many on my own  Who cares  But in this case 
[00:24:30]  We could say rub out right?  Yeah  Sure  We were doing some of that  That dry humping  You say that too  We've talked about the dry hump  Many a time  Because she  Was having her friend  Yeah  Her friend  But I didn't know she was having her friend  Jim  We were in a car  Outside the bar  And I was doing the  I'm pushing some buttons  Pushing buttons  Pushing buttons  Pointing  Two fingered pushing of buttons 
[00:25:00]  I was  I was pointing  And then I mounted  But you're completely clothed  Completely clothed  Yeah  How much of this is getting on the air?  I think all of it  Okay  It better be  Because I've heard nothing  Nothing that  All right  So I mounted  And I  I did my thing  And then I said  All right  See you later  See you at the Clio house  Later on  Now  Did you finish  Anything?  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  I was just  I was just a slob  But how did you do that? 
[00:25:30]  Went to work I didn't care  How did you do that?  Just using the rubbing through clothing  How?  Yeah  You were able to complete the  Oh yeah  In your  Jeans?  Yeah  My stonewashed jeans  Hey this is going back  What a mess  In there  Then mopped up  And went in the bar  Oh wow  Looks like a camel  Spit on them  I wish  It was a lot worse than that  Oh  So I go inside  And there's all these 
[00:26:00]  Black lights  And DJ's at the time  And I'm walking to the booth  I have to walk across  The dance floor  And the one bar  And all that  And a lot of people  Are looking at me  And they start laughing  And I don't know why  Well I guess the black light  Isolated a spot  On the front of my pants  That was as big as  Home plate let's say  It was the entire front  Of my stonewashed jeans  It was 
[00:26:30]  Can I  It was  Time of the month  Right right  It was that stuff  It was  It was like a walking crime scene  It was probably a lot of  Oh yeah  No yeah  It was probably also  It looked like I was  Dry humping a puddle  All right  So they're all laughing  I'm like what the hell is this  Because it's a black light  So I can't really  So I get in the regular light  I'm like oh my god  Drenched  And then I go back out 
[00:27:00]  To my car  Because now I'm freaking  I'm like what the hell  Happened in there  Huge huge spot  On the passenger seat  Crime scene  Did it look like  The back seat of the car  From Pulp Fiction  Driving the black guy back  Pretty close  Hit that bump  Pretty effing close  Oh man  Yeah  Pretty close  Harvey Keitel  You gotta call Harvey Keitel  For your car  To get it cleaned out  Hey this is some of that  Gold made  And then Quentin Tarantino's there 
[00:27:30]  Doing some bad acting  Yeah  Wrecked that whole damn scene  Jim what's up  What's going on guys  Hey  Yeah I'm just curious  Did you get the escort  Because Bubba  The copy  Had to get Spuds Buckley  Through  Alright  I've taken enough shots today  Thank you  Spuds Buckley  Alright we got Tim Sabian  On the line  Want to go to him  Let's talk to  But then we got the guy  That brought the  Miss Pac-Man game in  Yeah  Well we better talk to  Big Mike  Yeah we gotta get to the bottom  Of why our  Miss Pac-Man was  Refuged  Big Mike  What's up guys

[00:34:00]  It was a phase of the campaign  We accepted  There was going to be  Some collateral damage  Tim what kind of pills  Were you popping  Those first few weeks  None  That was just natural  Natural energy  Xanax  Some of the Zoloft  We make fun of Tim  Because quite frankly  It's really easy  But he has believed in us  For a very long time  We should tell people that  He was the first station  To pick us up  In syndication  Yeah  And he wanted to  Like a year before  We even made it on  In Philadelphia  He was just patiently waiting  He was right  Absolutely right 
[00:34:30]  Patiently waiting  At his desk  For it to happen  A lot of people  Knowing that he would have to  He would work  He wouldn't have to work as hard  If he were in town  A lot of people  In the industry  A lot of people  In the industry  Were wondering  How the model  Opie and Anthony  In the afternoons  Was going to do  And I think  I think  Wow  It seems to work out  If only this station  Would accept that  Or something  If only we were able  To do that  In our own city  But for some reason  That won't happen  Every city  We're syndicated  In just about 
[00:35:00]  Right  That's the model  But in New York  They can't  They can't figure that one out  Yeah  For some reason  Oh well  Mr. Sabian  Yes sir  Hi it's Jim Norton  Mr. Norton  How are you sir  Fine thank you for asking  By the way  Congratulations to you  Mr. Norton  Oh no  Jim Norton had nothing  To do with this one  No but for joining the team  He's only been a part  Of the show  For a little while  As a friend of the show  I just wanted you to know  That I'll be coming down  And to celebrate  My friend's success  I can't wait to get to Philly  And share a room with Rick  I heard about that  I'm really looking forward to that 
[00:35:30]  What's that all about  I don't know  This is a huge problem  Tim  Did you guys know about that  Hold on  This is a huge problem  And we should have told you  Something about Norton  Can I tell Tim about you  Yes  That you're pretty much  A sexaholic  And you're completely  Out of your freaking mind  Not pretty much  It's not even normal sex  It's disgusting sex  Right  And we're bunking up  Because boy Tim  You love spending money  Down there  Thanks  Yeah  Everyone bunk up  Bunk up 
[00:36:00]  You guys have your own  Bunk up  Bunky  Just gave you killer ratings  But let's get everyone  Bunked up  Bunk up  So he wants Jim Norton  With Rick  Now Norton doesn't consider  People in the same room  As him roommates  They are potential witnesses  So  It's not even  It's not even the realm  Of possibility  That he should have  Someone in the room  With him  Aside from who he likes  To call the victim  Right  That's fine  It was funny  Because we casually  Said to Jim  Oh you'll be rooming  With Rick  When we go down to Philly  For our cute little 
[00:36:30]  No I'm not  No I'm not  No I'm not  He freaked out  How's Rick with a camera  Off the cuff  He goes  Yeah so how are you  Going to like  Staying with Rick  Next week  And he had no idea  And you flipped out  Completely  And there was only  Four of us in here  He was going  No  No  I can't share a room  With anybody  Nothing against Rick  I can't share it  With anybody  I don't share rooms  I have things  I do  I go out  I get chicks  I get laid  I do things  I can't be without Rick  In the same room  And we're like  Hey hey calm down  You'll get your own room  And I smoke  And Rick doesn't smoke  He's healthy  And he rolls 
[00:37:00]  That's what it comes down to  I don't need to see him  Shirtless  I don't want to see him  Shirtless  It wasn't even in the realm  Of possibilities  It's like  Do you know what I do  When I'm in a hotel room  I'm online  I'm whacking my bag  It's disgusting  He does not need people  In his room  To bunk with  Oh yeah  Remember last year  I spent 28 hours  In a jail cell with him  And I like Rick very much  I got to see  Kind of like  What he was about  Yeah  Scary  But it's not that  It's not Rick  The only people  I share a room with  Are possibly  Ozzy Osbourne  I would share a room with  In case he needed 
[00:37:30]  This mule drank out of  Aside from that  Nobody else  That's it  Alright  So we're coming down  There Wednesday Tim  I can't wait  All day we'll be in Philly  Hanging and doing the radio show  Then the road show  After the radio show  With days of new  Everyone knows the story  By now of that  I'm sure right  Absolutely  But once again  I can't thank you guys enough  For all your hard work  And I appreciate it  Very very much  Tim thank you  For taking that gamble  Which we knew  Wasn't a gamble  Yeah  But you know  Are the papers calling you Tim  It's a pretty big story

[00:47:00]  To list right now  It's most of the  Off the cuff  Little remarks  And the  The passionate feelings  That you have  About certain sports teams  And stuff  That just  Plagues you  Time and time again  These teams will lose  As you remember  On Friday  I didn't want to  Talk about the Jets at all  Because I just  Didn't want to jinx it  I'm getting that freaked out  So I just let it go  Didn't say a word  Didn't say a word  About the Jets  No  But we got to play the tape  What happened  Oh my gosh 
[00:47:30]  We'll deal with that  We're going to have  Some problems soon  That's alright  We haven't had problems  In a while  Nah  We're going to have  Some serious problems  Anyway  I got the audio  From Friday  Thank God  This was Friday  We'll be talking about  The Islanders home opener  Which you went to  Against the Red Wings  There at Nassau Coliseum  Here in New York  And talking about the Yankees  Who are two games down  Best out of five  Against Oakland 
[00:48:00]  Yeah  It was Friday  I was getting excited  Because yeah  The home opener  Was over the weekend  For the Islanders  At the Coliseum  They were 4-0  Yankees were down  Two to nothing  It just looked grim  In a best out of five  They were going to Oakland  Two games down  One game away  From elimination  And well  You gave  What I feel  Is your prediction  As to what will happen  In those circumstances  This is really audio  From Friday's show  So let's go to the tape  This is what I said 
[00:48:30]  Friday  Right  Andy you're next  To the Opie and Anthony show  Hey what's going on  With this sports curse  Huh  Sports curse is over  My friends  Yankees are losing bad  And the Islanders  If you can believe it  Are 4-0  This can only lead me  To believe  The Yankees will pull  Such a miracle  Rally  And win three in a row  Anthony  I'm going to go out  On a limb  And I'm going to tell you  Yankees will be defeated  By the A's  Oh my god 
[00:49:00]  Sports god  You heard that  You heard that  It's a Yankees sweep  Not only are the Islanders  4-0  They're 4-0  On the road  Right  Have not played  A home game yet  That happens tomorrow  And we're all going down  With your sports curse  What could happen  I see that big scoreboard  At the Nassau Coliseum  Falling on the team  That's the only thing  That could happen  Falling on their  When they have  Their home opener  Well the scoreboard  Didn't fall down  So that's what I said 
[00:49:30]  Friday  The Yankees sweep  A miracle  So I go to the Coliseum  On Saturday  Great game  Yeah  I'm sitting there  Next to Joey Faisano  And it's looking really good  For the Islanders  The Islanders truly  Outplayed the Red Wings  Sure  On Saturday  And without Pekka  I should say  And listeners of the show  Coming up like crazy  And like  Hey man  That looks like  The sports curse  Is finally over  Because everyone  It's not even a joke anymore 
[00:50:00]  It's in everyone's brains  Right  Because it's just ridiculous  So I'm like  Yeah  Third period happens  There is  Nine seconds left  In the game  Nine seconds left  In the game  There's just all sorts  Of action in front  Of the Islanders  Net  And the Red Wings score  To tie it  With nine seconds  Nine seconds  Did you just get  Pelted with cups  And beer and whatnot  And french fries  At that point  I wanted to disappear  In my seat  Because now  Now there's some people 
[00:50:30]  In the area  Going oh great  Oh  I'll be  And to stay home  Next time  But it wasn't even joking  They were like  Dead serious at this point  Of course they are  So then I'm like  Well  I'm praying  I'm like oh my god  OT  OT  Just hang in there  Tie is okay  At least I can explain  A tie  I'll get a little abused  Because they tied it up  With nine seconds left  But a tie  Still undefeated  And the Red Wings  Win in overtime  Right  Oh  I had a hide  Yeah  I snuck out as fast  As I could 
[00:51:00]  Did anybody get you  Or say hey  See  No  Honestly everyone  Was so pumped out  Yeah  Just in general  That no  They headed for the exits  A very disappointing  Home opener loss  In overtime  It was still really exciting  Jamie Lynn Sigler  Our friend  Did the national anthem  Or God bless America  Did she?  Whichever one they're singing  These days  And she killed  It sounded great  Absolutely killed  And then she hits the high note  At the end of the song  Yeah  They let a bald eagle  Loose from like  The box seats up top  Yeah  Comes right down  On the guy's 
[00:51:30]  You know  Gloved hand  Uh huh  Place went nuts  Of course  Huge flag at  Center Ice  With the firemen  And the police  Holding it out  It was like a teary eyeball moment  The place went  Freaking nuts  How did Jamie Lynn's ass look?  She looked great  That's what I  It's like the eagle  The flag  How about her ass?  What was she wearing?  Um  Regular clothes  Yeah you gotta be  Kind of respectful  When you're singing that  So she probably wasn't wearing  She should wear  I gotta tell you  What's going on  Yeah  I gotta tell you  What's going on  With the Islanders 
[00:52:00]  I don't know  I mean we're in a lot  Of cities now  If there are other  Hockey teams doing this  You gotta call the show  They got ice sluts now  Ice sluts  Ice sluts  They call them that?  Well that's what we're calling them  Me and Joey  They were like chubby  Britney Spears  Wannabe chicks  Uh huh  That are really good skaters  You know when there's  A break in the action  Uh  And you know  There's a lot of ice shavings  And stuff around the goal  And around where the players  Get on and off  Yeah  That they have to take care of  So in a break in the action  You usually get  Like an old guy 
[00:52:30]  With a shovel and a pail  And he's in his shoes  And he's like  Whoa whoa  And he can't  He can barely get to the spot  And he  You know  He takes the big shovel  And gets rid of the ice chips  Yeah  He's got a hat on  And he's just really awkward out there  Now they got four girls  That come out from opposite ends  And skate  You know  Across the entire rink  Whoa  In these just tight  Hot outfits  Midriff shirts  They got big huge shovels  And the one girl  Bends down like this  Just bends right over  Right over  To get all the ice  You know  Shavings 
[00:53:00]  Ooh  XHL  Right  It's ripping off Vince  In the XFL  We were calling them  Like the ice sluts  With their big shovels  You know  A lot of professional sports  You're going to be picking up  Some of the things  The sex appeal things  That work  But a lot of guys  Were getting that elbow  From their chicks  Yeah  Don't walk  Because oh yeah  The hooting and hollering  Yeah  And you know  They're getting the elbow  To the ribs  Rocks though  The girls bend  All the way over  Great skaters  Yeah  What's wrong  With looking at the skaters  When you're sitting there  With a big fatty 
[00:53:30]  With the spandex  And the socks  Pulled up over the  Outside of the pants  And Reebok sneakers  Ugh  The whip  So  So that happened  And then  Then I watched the  Then I watched the  The Yankees  Win two in a row  The Yankees  My god  I got one more to go though  Yeah yeah  Very important  I  Not one yet  One more to go  No I'm not even  Listening to anything  Opie says  Because he already  Said it on Friday  That was it  I'm not saying a word  That was done  So that's all  I'm basing anything on  Right now 
[00:54:00]  I want tonight's game  See people are begging  At the stadium  Like Steve in D.C.  Please root for Dallas  Tonight  You know  So the Redskins will win  You gotta understand  It's when I get passionate  About my predictions  I could care less  About the Redskins  Or the Cowboys  No offense to our  Our listeners of Washington  Well I don't think  The Washington listeners  Care much about the Redskins  This season  You know  But it's when I had  That passion  Every time  It  It kills me  And Friday  You know  We heard it  We heard about the Yankees 
[00:54:30]  Here it is again  I love how sure you are  Here it is again  This is what I said  Friday  The Yanks are down  Two games to nothing  And they're going to Oakland  Too  And they're going to Oakland  Oakland was undefeated  At home for what  17 games in a row  They had 19  Hold on  You're not even on  They won 19 straight  And the Yanks lost  Their last six games there  Right  It didn't look good  It did not look good  The best part of this clip  From Friday's show  Is Anthony just going  Oh my god  It's a given  I loved it  Andy you're next  To the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:55:00]  Hey what's going on  With this sports curse  Huh  Sports curse is over  My friends  Yankees are losing bad  And the Islanders  If you can believe it  Are 4-0  This can only lead me  To believe  The Yankees will pull  Such a miracle  Rally  And win three in a row  Anthony I'm going to go out  On a limb  And I'm going to tell you  Yankees will be defeated  By the A's  Oh my god  Sports god  You heard that  You heard that 
[00:55:30]  It's a Yankee sweep  Not only are the Islanders  4-0  They're 4-0  On the road  They're not playing  A home game yet  That happens tomorrow  And we're all going down  With your sports curse  What could happen  I see that big scoreboard  At the Nassau Coliseum  Falling on the team  That's the only thing  That could happen  When they have  Their home opener  That was it  Yankees lose to Atlanta  Or to Oakland  Unbelievable  Look it was a tough game  For the Islanders 
[00:56:00]  But just how they lost  At 9 seconds left  In the game  They tie in  And then lose in overtime  I'm sitting there  I was freaking myself out  Where's that guy  From Friday  That was called  Remember him  Hey  Shut up  What happened  And I wasn't being  Cocky or anything  I was just saying  If any team could do it  You got another game  Hopefully  That's what I'm saying  That's what I'm saying  That's why I'm not  Like oh my god  Miracle victory here  It's going to be very tough  You know  We're looking at the same  Line up from game one  That they got spanked in 
[00:56:30]  And you know what  Hopefully though  Now  It's one game  They're at the stadium  Let's just do this  Get it over with  And keep the sports curse  A lot  Steve what's up  Yo guys  Hey Steve  Tim Barr  Out in Winding River  At Phil's  Oh Phil's Sports Bar  Yes  Nice  Your uncle  Tom  Comes there all the time  He loves that place  Yes  He's very real  So I'm working  Whatever is busy  I look  And I see

[01:00:00]  Shirts are never funny  You know  Ever  The guy's not a bad looking guy  He's looking for a broad  And I'm like  Tom it might be your t-shirts  Yeah  Any shirt  Not just anybody  Shirts  Like he has one  I think he has one  With the big arrow  So like  If he's trying to pick up  A girl at a bar  The arrow points to the girl  And it says  I'm with stupid  Ah that's great  That's a funny shirt  Or  Oh they're just the worst  People walk around  And hear some funny thing  On my chest  It's never funny 
[01:00:30]  I'm with stupid  You know when wacky shirts  Are funny  When there's a bullet hole  Tearing through them  People can just hang up  If people want  Opi's predictions  You heard it already  It's there  He's not going to predict  The outcome of tonight's game  You heard the tape from Friday  That we're leaving it at that  And for the new cities  You've got to make it perfectly clear  When was the  Hold on Chuck 
[01:01:00]  When was the last time  I picked a game  Seriously  Maybe a listener  Could help us out  I don't remember  The last time  That I said  So and so was going to win  And they won  I believe it was  Oh that you picked them to win  And they won  Yeah I can't remember  Ice ball  I can't remember  It was the  It was Michael Jordan's last game  Before he retired last time  Was it?  Yeah  Thanks Rick  Jesus  The scariest one though  Was we weren't even thinking  About the  You know the curse  Yeah  And we get  Syndicated to all these cities 
[01:01:30]  And week one of the NFL season  Every  Every city that we're syndicated to  Their team lost  Or didn't cover  The point spread  There was  All of them lost  Except for one  And that was the Niners  But they didn't cover  They didn't cover the spread  So it was just an amazing defeat  Of all the cities  I heard in like 92  You took Buffalo  And 34  We explained the Super Bowl curse  I was in Buffalo  For all four losses  I was in New England  For the  The Pats loss 
[01:02:00]  In the Super Bowl  And I was down here  For the Giants loss  It's very strict  I have a million of them  And then someone  Emailed us about  What happened  After we got  Syndicated back to Boston  The Red Sox  Completely fell apart  Yeah  Someone send those stats again  Because someone did  It's ridiculous  To your credit  They completely fell apart  Starting the day  We got back on the air  In Boston  To your credit  And I must say  You know  I feel bad for Boston  On a lot of occasions  But that's nothing new  Okay 
[01:02:30]  I think they can appreciate  The fact that  That's been happening  For a while  The Red Sox  Yeah  They self-destruct  They're a self-destruct team  They made a good move  This year though  Because when you're  In a playoff race  You always want to  Get rid of the manager  You know  Who needs him around  You had to blame somebody  That was pretty ridiculous  And the Pats  Had a good win  Over Flutie this weekend  So  Alright Ben  Chill out  Hope he used to take  The Christians over  The Lions  In the Coliseum  Back in the old days  Hey Chuck  What's up  Hey  Did you guys see 
[01:03:00]  The Tyson fight  Yeah  Oh my god  What a mess that was  Oh man  That guy  He was fighting  The  What were they calling him  Danish pastry  The Danish pastry  Yeah  The beached whale  He was just a big  Fat  Piece of crap  That I must say  Could take some  Abuse  Because that's all he did  For seven rounds  Tyson  Oh yeah  That first time  Tyson knocked him down  He looked pretty surprised at him  And then he said  Could you understand 
[01:03:30]  One word that guy was saying  No  No not at all  We got the clips of him talking  Well beforehand  I was able to understand  The pre-interview  Little things that they do  And then after  Seven rounds with Tyson  He sounded a little different  And what was  Did you hear Tyson's interview  Like right after the fight  Praise be god  He doesn't say Allah anymore  He was talking to this one guy  And he was like  Asking the guy  He's like  Didn't I do alright  Did I hit him pretty hard  I hit him pretty good  I think  Chuck 
[01:04:00]  No we'll do  We'll take a break  And then we'll play  The Tyson clips  Yeah  I agree  And we might even have  A little visit from Tyson today  I see the bullhorn  So that's definitely impossible  Can you guys do  A Ronald Reagan skit  Sometime soon  Yeah we should  Poor Reagan  But it's not a skit  We just call him  Because he's our pal  Right  Great  Bob Hope is stopping in today  He is  Alright Chuck  Thank you  Alright thanks a lot  Yeah we'll talk about  The Tyson fight next  As we take a break  A couple  I think it's the same guy  But a couple requests  For the Bills dead today  Oh this is classic 
[01:04:30]  We always use this  As an example of  Opie's pure  Almost criminal  Insensitivity to human beings  This is  Unbelievably horrible  I talked to my friend  When I made  Stalker Patty leak herself  I put that in the same  I don't put it  In the same category  Have you ever made  Same impact  Have you ever made  A girl leak herself  Yes  Not for those reasons  That's why I wasn't  Even looking at you  Not out of fear  We're talking about  Out of fear my friend  No but this woman  I mean you didn't 
[01:05:00]  Know her from  Not because she was  Getting 25 bucks  In a line  They want more than that  Yeah that's cheap  That's old  Old school prices  Yeah 25  But you don't get that  You don't get the  Salty love with us  For 25  No it's the yellow shame  Right the yellow shame  Someone remember  The yellow shame  Yeah this  This is a phone call  That came in  To the station  This woman  Was looking for her  Friend Bill  And instead of just  Saying you have the  Wrong number  Opie decided to  Play a fun little 
[01:05:30]  Gag on her  That I think almost  Cost her her life  Really  She's very upset  She called the station  And she was  Ruthless  She was calling her  Friend Bill  But she dialed  Wrong and got us  Instead  Hello  Hi  Hi  Bill  Who's this  Pat  Hi Pat  How are you  Now this is  The wrong  Bill  Well Pat  I have some bad news  What  Bill died today  Yeah kid  Oh my god 
[01:06:00]  Yeah  It's tragic  Who is this  He was in a car  Accident today  Oh no  Who is this  John  John  Yeah  Oh boy  Oh my god  I don't believe it  Yeah  I was just  Talking to him  I know

He can make a mean pastry  And all sorts of French delicacies  Oui  It's like the general of France  But I  I said  I kick it up the nuts  I said he  I said he's a great French chef  But quite frankly  His mic skills stink  So I told him to stay off the microphone today  I did  I said  You said what his skills are in the kitchen  I said his mic skills are the equivalent of  The skills of a short order cook at a Taco Bell 
[01:09:00]  See?  That's an insult  See, you do very well in the kitchen  But  You know  It's nice  I get to sit next to the uncircumcised stalker  Good one  You're awful  Good one  Good one  Is it safe?

There's some of your short order of Taco Bell cooking  Here's something  Here's something  As the American planes bypass France 
[01:10:00]  Why don't you bypass the studio  When you're in Manhattan?  I mean, they're not  They're still not letting us use their airspace?  I don't believe we have to use their airspace  But, I don't know  Maybe from England  I don't know  I don't think so  Where are you?  Ah, the French  They love us  Don't they over there?  Frenchy  When you come in  Why don't you bring some skillets  And then whip us up something?  You know how on Hogan's Heroes  Whenever LeBeau came into the camp  The barracks  He'd always have some strudel or something 
[01:10:30]  That's what you got  You're like LeBeau  The last time I cooked something  I sent off the alarm fire  The fire alarm  Right  When you cook in here  So if you cook again  I'll take a beer  Crunchy, we don't hang out with you  Because you're a sparkling personality  Whip up a pastry for us, will you?

[01:11:30]  And he cooked the rat  We called him Jeffrey Dahmer  Just by the way, he killed the rat  I think he bit its head off  Yeah, he did an Aussie on it  And people that drank some of that  That ate some of that  Were vomiting in the bathroom  Same meat, everything  It was rat meat  What the hell is the well-topped, fermented, speciality?  Yeah, it's another type of Belgian beer  Canadian beer  Oh, it's Canadian?  Really?  French Canada, you know  Ah, the French Canadian  Quebec  Quebec  8.5

[01:15:00]  Guessing a girl's age by her taint  Right  You know  I am four from four  As far as that goes  Can we replay the taint guessing from Friday, Rick?  Is that possible?  Yeah, just give me a few minutes to figure it out  All right, good  Because a lot of people mention it  Matt writes  Opie, being able to tell a woman's age from her taint  Is a fair trade for having a sports curse  Thank you  And Frank, right from the city here, writes  Hey guys, does Opie's uncle have the good old classic t-shirt  Arrow pointing down at your crotch  And it says, home of the Whopper  Boy, that's going to get you somewhere in life 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah  Oh, what the whop  My uncle loves those shirts  You want a really funny shirt  You can't get enough of them  I saw this one  And it's just guys that crack me up  Because it said  I think it was down the shore  Where you find a lot of good ones  It says, I'm not as think as you drunk I am  I pointed and laughed  Very funny  It's just fun for anyone who would  Isn't that great?  You're thinking of talking  Don't talk 
[01:16:00]  He looked like he was winding up for something  Here's what I want to know  He thought he had something witty  He was going to try it out on us  Can you guess the age of a French pastry chef  By driving a fishing knife into his taint?  No, but I'm willing to learn  Joe, what's up?  Hey guys  The interns would kill for any kind of airtime  And this guy brings a Pop-Tart  And he gets the whole break  It wasn't a Pop-Tart, but yes  Pop-Tart  And now he calls in as part of the show  Will you shut up, Frenchy?  What do you think of a Pop-Tart? 
[01:16:30]  That's the problem with this  He's done it  Stupid American pastry  Does he have his own porn in the office yet?  No, he's like a lot of the hangar-ons  There's a reason why they get  You know, involved with our radio show  And then they stop doing that skill  The whole reason Frenchy used to come around  Was because he would cook  Right, like I said, LeBeau  And now he buys pastries from the corner deli  And makes believe he made them up in his kitchen  Do you realize LeBeau did nothing on Hogan's Heroes 
[01:17:00]  Except make nice stuff for the rest of the guys to eat  As they were, you know, going out and sabotaging the ball-bearing plant  Or trying to get an agent back to England or something  Yeah, the black guy even was head of communications  Hogan was banging chicks getting info  You know, and LeBeau would be like  Oh, I brought a strudel  Oh, thanks, LeBeau  Now, you know, they wouldn't let LeBeau hang out  If he wasn't bringing the strudel  And that's the point we're getting at  And Frenchy, where's your chaperone hat?  I don't know how I want to do it  Oh, the chapeau 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, the chapeau  The chapeau  The Italian usually wear those, you know  The pizzaiolo  All right, yeah, yeah, thank you, thank you  Joe  Joe, you done?  Yeah, I think he hung up  All right, let's move on to Chad  Hey, Chad, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Pretty good  I saw Stephen Lynch yesterday in D.C.  I go down to school here  And first of all, they said the show was for all ages  Oh, boy  And there were families there with little kids 
[01:18:00]  And, like, old people  Oh, my God  And he opened up with hermaphrodite  Stop it  No, seriously  And as soon as they got through the middle of the song  You saw, like, five families walk right out  And a bunch of old people walk right out  Good  The only thing I ever saw  Good  Oh, my God  Yeah, he is not an act for kids  Oh, look, it's a guy  Look at the guy  It's a guy with a guitar  This is going to be great  Maybe he'll do Puff the Magic Dragon  Strum a fun number  A fun little ditty 
[01:18:30]  And there he goes  Singing about somebody with both types of private parts  It was just so funny when he came out  Ooh, dump out of that  So people were walking out of the show, huh?  Yeah, it was just so funny when he came out  He's like, oh, my God, kids  Yeah  Like, they're all sitting in the front rows  Yeah  And he's like, I've got to fire my manager  That's classic  Good for Lynch for doing his stuff  Good for him for not bailing out because of stupid families with their dumb kids 
[01:19:00]  He went through the whole thing, though?  Yeah, he played a couple songs  Like, not his most offensive songs, but some of them  He played, like, If I Were Gay  Uh-oh  Hermaphrodite  God, why does a French beer look pretty, like they're pastries?  It looks like some sort of souffle top  Or meringue  The foam on this beer looks like a meringue  Does everything in France have to be pretty and puffy?  He just poured a beer and it looks like you're drinking a hot cocoa with a lot of whipped cream on top 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  You make a little mustache from it and everybody laughs  You dick  That's great  There's no way to be cool if you're French  I would love to hear from Lynch  Well, you were finding we'd want 60 feet on the water, right?  Right  I hope his fight that he had on the water was with a French guy  He's got chops  He's got chops  He's got some radio chops to him  I wish he would have brought them 
[01:20:00]  Pork chops, something  Some kind of chops  Okay, guys, I'm out  I've got to go to class  You keep it up  We might leave you alone for a whole Rocktober day  You can have Rocktober, you know, festivities on your radio show  John, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good  Good  I'm calling from Philly  I wanted to congratulate you on doing as well as you're doing down here  No, the thank you goes out to you guys  Yes  I'm going to see you guys on Wednesday 
[01:20:30]  Cool  Very cool  But a real reason why I wanted to call  I heard the thing you did on Friday with Bubba Ray Dudley  Yeah  And I went to the show in Atlantic City on Saturday night  And lo and behold, there was a sign that said, Bubba, I can see the string  No way  Yeah, someone brought it  Nice  That's so cool  Yeah, we kind of  I was wetting my pants  We want people to abuse Bubba with string signs  He didn't know  We had the girl come in 
[01:21:00]  This is a girl who's an expert on the A-sex  We had her in Friday  Bubba was all doing it  I guessed her age  Yes, Opie guessed her age by just looking at her taint  Four for four, Rick's getting the taint  He's four now  And she, before Opie was going to guess her age  She wanted to have this private conference with Opie  Now, no one's stupid in here  We all knew what she meant  She was going to tell Opie that it was her time  And she might have had something going on that was visual  So everyone's laughing  We all knew, we didn't care  And she started showing Opie the taint anyway 
[01:21:30]  No, we had a whole discussion about crime scene sex  Crime scene sex  When you have your, you earn your red wings, they call it  You have that type of sex  And the bed looks like somebody's been shot in it  For the love of God  And we were all laughing about it  And then five minutes later  She starts showing Opie the area, the taint  So he can guess the age  And Bubba Ray looks up and goes  What's with the string?  Or is that a string there?  And we all go, what?  But Bubba, we were just talking about it  Right  So now we want people at WWF events 
[01:22:00]  To hold up signs abusing Bubba about the string  I'm sure you'll see him tonight on the Raw show  Cool  Oh, cool  All right, John, thank you  All right, take care  All right, bye  And can I state that nothing in life grosses me out  Crime scene sex  Awful  You don't like that?  No  I never do  I can't do it  Wow, that's odd  No, I don't know  From you, I would think  No  Well, the type of woman that you usually have  Doesn't get it yet  No, just the idea of blood, right?  Either doesn't get it yet  Or you don't want to mix yourself with her blood 
[01:22:30]  Because it's probably got some diseases  It's a temperature thing with Norton  Because usually in that state, they're nice and cold  Oh  Lynch  They're bleeding  Lynch  What's up?  What's up?  Where are you, on the wing of an aircraft?  I am, I'm on the tarmac at LaGuardia  Are you really?  No, I just pulled in from D.C. in my stunning performance at the Kennedy Center  Ah, okay  Now people have been calling us and saw you there  And said the audience was a little less than receptive to your type of music 
[01:23:00]  And they started walking out after you sang Hermaphrodite  They left in mass  It was unbelievable  Well, I didn't know, it was a show  It was open to the public  So they know  They obviously didn't know what you were about  And it was free  And so the first three rows were, I'd say, kids under 10  And the first time I mentioned, you know, genitals and pus  Their parents are up there so quickly clasping, you know, hands over ears and whisking them away 
[01:23:30]  It just kind of set a tone for the whole show  It's pretty humiliating  I'm really proud of you, good for you doing your stuff  Get those effing kids out  Take them to a zoo  Stop bringing them to adult places  That was my dilemma, you know  I could have either toned the show down  And done a, you know, watertight three minutes of material  Do some Peter, Paul, and Mary  Yeah, or just do what I did  So I did it  And I don't know, some of the audience liked it  Those people, there were some ONA fans there 
[01:24:00]  And people who drove just to see me  But the rest of the audience was not real happy  Are you in an airplane?  No, now I'm in LaGuardia  Oh, you were in the airplane  Well, you know, people get cell phone calls from airplanes  And it's about, you know, we're charging the hijackers  Tell my family I love them  We got Lynch talking about how kids and old people ran from his gig  Wonderful  Well, I don't know if Rick told you  But I canceled my show at Governor's on Wednesday  So I could go to the Philly show  Now there is your 
[01:24:30]  There's your audience, Lynch  So I really need to make up for yesterday on Wednesday  There might be kids and old people there at that gig  But they're all getting effed after the show  Yeah, exactly  Lynch, it's going to be so much fun at the Electric Factory Wednesday  Yeah, I can't wait  I'm going to have a good time  All right, well, thanks for the update  Yeah, we heard that a bunch of people walked out of the show  Yeah, it was pretty bad  Jeez, that hurts  Isn't that so uncomfortable when you're on the stage?  No, because, you know, like I said 
[01:25:00]  There's probably 300 or 400 people there  About 50 of them actually knew what they were getting into  And they were really enthusiastic  So I kind of just played to those people  Stephen, what did you do when you scanned the crowd  And went like, uh-oh, what the hell?  Did you know people were just going to walk out?  Yeah  Yeah, absolutely  Oh, I knew it was going to happen  And I knew I was going to have to blast them  Immediately  Early  To get the kids out  And set the tone for the rest of the show  Right  So that's what I did 
[01:25:30]  You should write some songs that are fun for the whole family  Because people are bringing their kids out  They want entertainment  They did that  D&D songs are fun for the whole family  See?  See, that would have sucked if you did that  And they were all clapping  And then all of a sudden you hit them with something  Having to do with a big shlop  I remember  I should have roped them right in  And then hit them with FBA or something  I remember you did a cute little song about a bowler once  Right?  I did  That's not really in my repertoire anymore, Opie  We played that song once  Once 
[01:26:00]  All right  Lynch, we'll see you Wednesday in Philly  We can't wait  All right, sounds good  Very cool  Did anyone tell you we're now number one in Philadelphia?  Ah  No  Ah  Congratulations  Ah  Oh  It should be a good show then  The men numbers are very impressive  And boy, they love us over there  Excellent  Thank you, Philly  Excellent  All right, Lynch  Excellent  All right, we'll see you guys Wednesday  You got it  All right  Here's a song that had people walking out in Washington  D.C. from Stephen Lynch  Oh, we got the song 
[01:26:30]  Sure  As we take a break  And when we get back  We'll actually start the radio show  We'll talk about Tyson  We got clips about Tyson  Mm-hmm  We got some Bob Hope stuff  All right  They don't want him to do the USO thing anymore  Gee, I wonder why  Maybe because he's 98  And then some Tom Brokaw stuff as well  So stay there, but here's Lynch  So Stephen Lynch is here  And you got a song for Julie  The transvestite pre-sex-op mess  Mess  Yeah, I dated somebody like that one 
[01:27:00]  Okay  And hermaphrodite is the technical lingo  Oh, thank you  Thank you, Stephen  In case you didn't know  I've seen that in the back of those catalogs  They send me sometimes  Yeah  Hermaphrodite  Well, I had a personal experience with one  You did?  Yeah, I wrote a little song  Okay  She's part girl  She's part boy  She's got parts everyone can enjoy 
[01:27:30]  She's got more  She's got less  She's got her manhood  Tucked in her dress  Yeah  Is she a mister  Or is she a miss  Does she stand up  When she's taking a  She's my little girl  She's my little guy  When I try to please her  I get poked in the eye 
[01:28:00]  Yeah  She wears lace  And she wears flannel  She watches football  And the Lifetime Channel  What's that bulge  Under her nightie  It's just my  Hermaphrodite  Yeah  Hermaphrodite  Some things are white 
[01:28:30]  Some things are black  Some girls wear makeup  Mine shaves her back  She is still beautiful  She is still fine  It's too bad her package is bigger than mine  Yeah  She looks like Cher  But she's built like Sonny  She loves Brad Pitt  And finds the Three Stooges funny  Who's that girl 
[01:29:00]  With the grip so mighty  It's just my  Hermaphrodite  Yeah  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Yeah  You've got to be kidding me  That was great 
[01:29:30]  Steve Lynch, everyone  Don't be an a-hole  Don't be an a-hole  You seem a little drunk, Anthony  Go after yourself, Anthony  P.O.D. Alive  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show  A couple phone numbers in the New York area  877-692-1027  Anywhere else 
[01:30:00]  866-2774  Wow  We want to welcome Steve from foundrymusic.com back to the show  Where has he been?  He had no clue, did he?  Nah, I did  I know where Steve's been  He got his stomach stapled  Everyone's doing it  Whether they need it or not  This is the hot surgery today  Yes  Everyone's getting it done  Do you see the scar on him?  Where's Steve?  Can we get him in real fast? 
[01:30:30]  Let's get Steve in here  Frenchy, you might have to give up your mic for Steve, alright?  Oh  Give up in French goes hand in hand, Opie  Whether it's a seat or a country  The French are always willing to give it up  Look how fast Frenchy gave up his mic  I know  Oh, I still am down  There was a German guy sitting there  He would have fought  Oh, please  That's right  Hey, Steve  He's comedy  Here he comes  He's already lost 15 pounds  Really?  Blitzkrieging his way into  Steve, how are you? 
[01:31:00]  I'm feeling pretty good  Feeling good  Yeah  How did it go?  You know, I got there on Monday  And I sat in a waiting room  Steve, what?  You don't look like a big guy  To start with  Yeah, that's what I was a little puzzled about  Like Ass Man from the Ron and Fez show  Is ridiculously huge  No, that guy sweats cheeseburger grease  I mean, there's a difference  You can be big  And you can be morbidly  Yeah, but I would think  The only time you would go to that extreme  To have that kind of surgery  Is if you are profoundly obese  Yeah, well, you know 
[01:31:30]  That was what it started out as  I think 30 years ago  When they started doing this stuff  Right  But now, it's become so commonplace  There were 15 people  That had the operation  The Monday that I had mine done  Really?  How long did it take?  An hour  Takes an hour  For them to go in  Cut me open  They cut you open  They cordon off part of your stomach  Yeah  And then the food just goes  To that little part of the stomach  And then goes right through you  Yeah, what they do is  They literally bypass the entire stomach 
[01:32:00]  And my stomach is now  Can hold about 2 ounces of material  And it's just  And my lower intestine  Is connected to that little 2 ounce pouch  So have you had any problems  With this  Trying to get used to the fact  That you can't eat as much?  A lot  A lot  What happens when you  You puke your guts out  Does it hurt  Puking after surgery?  Yeah  It does actually  It hurts  It really hurts  Bring Billy Staples in  He's outside the studio  From the Ron and Fez show  Used to be fat guy  From the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:32:30]  I can't believe  Just in this station alone  Between two shows  There are three people  Three people  That have had this done  Billy  Have you guys been talking all day  Like hey how'd it go  And trading cute little stories  No I haven't seen Billy yet  This is the first time I've seen Billy  I didn't even know Steve was back in  It's ironic  I just brought in my pictures  From the surgery  That showed around  Yeah he's got the wow sticker on his  Now Billy  How long ago did you have it done?  September 11th  Believe it or not  A year ago  September 11th  It's been a year already  Yeah  September 11th  Great  What did you lose man?  You look good  Just under 100 pounds  He's lost just under 100 
[01:33:00]  Yeah you were at the point  Where you had trouble walking  Because your knees  Really  Walking  Tying shoes  Going to a movie  Anything  Things you take for granted  Yeah  Same junk  Yeah the picture right there  Is amazing  It looks good man  Yeah it's amazing  And did you have the same surgery  Steve just had  Or was yours different?  Did you have the VBG?  I had VBG  VBG  VBG  What is that?  Very big guy  It's inside lingo  We can't tell you  It's a vertical banded gastroplasty  Is what it means 
[01:33:30]  And it means that  They put a little plastic band  Around the bottom of your esophagus  To prevent the food from going in  As fast as it normally would  Oh okay  So now wait a minute  So if you eat too fast  It's going to back its way up to your throat  That's why you puke  That's why you puke  So you can't chew anything  It's got to be all  You've got to chew everything extremely well  So not only the band  But then they also cut down the stomach  So that when the food finally does go through  It doesn't have as much area to be absorbed in  And it just goes out  They make a pouch 
[01:34:00]  Right  They make a pouch  And when your pouch gets filled  You feel like you're full  You really do  Do you really feel like you're full  You really do  And if you do eat too much  It's bleh  Yeah  I think the one Billy had  Is a little bit different than the one he had  Just the actual band  Like a little band  Like if those two plastic things come off  It wouldn't be that much harder  To get Billy's stomach back to where it was  Uh huh  I actually have to get my stomach put back together  What?  What?  What?  Why is that?  Well there's a gastric banding process  And then there's a vertebral  And then there's a banding with the bypass 
[01:34:30]  So my stomach was cut in half  And made about two ounces of this  And then they put the band around it  How big is it regularly?  If it's two ounces now  What was it before?  It was probably holding about a liter of  Of  How many ounces is that?  I have no idea  Did they take any out?  Or is it all still in there?  It's all still there  The stomach's all still in there  It's all reversible  See like  Fat man had  Fat man  Fat guy  What's his name?  Ass man  Thank you  Ass man  Had to bypass  Which completely now avoids his stomach whatsoever  So he's got to be on nutrients and supplements for the rest of his life  So him 
[01:35:00]  It's like bye bye  Not even see this stuff  The stomach is like we said  Like Asbury Park now  It's become like  Used to be  Used to be a party central  People would go there all the time  Carnivals  Boardwalk  It was the place to be  Now  Just a mere shell of its former self  Empty  Broken down cobwebs  Steve had this a week ago  And he's back at work  Right  Well I'm not as bad off as someone like Ass Man  Show the scar man  Check out this scar  It's practically healed though  Whoa that's big  You know something 
[01:35:30]  I gotta tell you  Wow  It's long  But it doesn't look like it's gonna  Really look like anything once it's healed  They both have the same scar  How cute  It goes from like  The bottom of the breastplate to the belly button  Right  And Steve you know  I have to say  Steve is not a big big  He's like a husky fellow  No  What made you do this?  Because even though I was working out for an hour and a half every morning  I still wasn't dropping weight  And what were you eating?  Probably more than I should have been  I was eating right  I just was eating too much  I mean the thing is  That's the question everyone on the phones is asking 
[01:36:00]  Why not just eat less?  Yeah  Well that's you know  It's forcing you to eat less  Why couldn't you just say to yourself  Hey I'm not gonna eat  Apparently I lacked the mechanism  Was that?  Okay  Alright  I don't have the mechanism that says  Stop eating  You're not  You're full  I just didn't have that  Whatever it was  I'm not blaming it on my parents  Now let me ask you something  You know  At some point  Or at every point  That you are eating  Right  And you go  I'm sure if you went to this extreme  You were conscious 
[01:36:30]  Of some point you're eating  And you would say  I've had enough  It's not like you keep eating  And go  Oh my god  I just ate an entire chicken  During the time you're eating  Didn't you say to yourself  I should stop right now  Um  Yeah but it's not  You know  It's  The point at which you say  I should stop right now  Is way past  The point at which I would say  I should stop right now  Is way past the time  That I should have said  Really  I should stop right now  It's an addiction right  Interesting  Yeah  It's an addiction  It's covering up loneliness  Yes  And a heartache from the past 
[01:37:00]  Rejection  Yeah but see  Then why are you having  Mine come out in other ways  Mine come out in drugs  And alcohol  And sex  And girls came out  It's like telling somebody  Stop smoking  Stop drinking  Right  If I only ate when I was hungry  It wouldn't have been 360 pounds  But Steve is like a big bone type of guy  Big bone  I would never be able to be as fat as you  It's impossible  I'm not fat  You know what it is  I see you  I never saw you as  As a fat guy  A fat guy  Just a big guy  Billy  Billy no offense  You were a fat guy  Ass man  Fat guy  I look at you Steve 
[01:37:30]  And I saw  Oh my god  It's the bouncer guy  You know the guy that you just don't  He looks like  Like a college linebacker  That let himself go  After his playing days  No seriously  You know he's  Still got some muscle tone  And stuff  Billy doesn't have a muscle  On his damn body  And a college linebacker  That let himself go  Would probably wind up  Weighing about  80 pounds more  Than he should weigh  Which is what I was at  And at 27  I was having this much trouble  And my doctor was like  Well look  If you're having this much trouble  At 27  It's only going to get harder  So this is when 
[01:38:00]  Oh okay  Well that's  That's a good point  You know your metabolism  Right  Still a young guy  And stuff so  Now how much have you lost  In a week  In a week I've lost 15 pounds  Already  And what did you eat today  I ate  An M&M  No I had  It was great  I savored it  Last night we grilled  Chicken breasts  And we put one in a blender  And ground it up  To the consistency  Of  Stop  Baby food  Ugh  And I ate that  And a thing of jello  And a little like  The plastic thing of jello  Party time  Exactly  Aren't you getting lightheaded  Yeah 
[01:38:30]  The shakes  Dude  I had to lay down  For a half hour  After I got back  From the gym this morning  So what do you do for that  What have they told you for that  Supplements or  Um  Well technically  Hey you can't take a vitamin  That's half my stomach space  Geez I want to eat  No I've got to take  Multivitamins every morning  Yeah  I've got to take  There's some people  That have to get injections  Every month  That they're  Heroin addicts  Yeah I've heard of them  Dave what about drinking  You love your beers  I will be able to  In a couple months  Just not as much  How much though  I'll get  Like after a shot or two  Of Jager 
[01:39:00]  I'll be on the floor  But naked  And show tunes  I can attest to how quickly  Alcohol affects you  After the operation  I can attest to that  It's going to go to your head  A lot quicker  Yeah but you like  Like sitting down  And drinking bottles of beer  And hanging out  Yeah  You can't do that though now  You can do it just slowly  You don't  You can't pound shots  You have to  You know  Why live  So you're a big guy  You could have a shot  And you'll be completely happy  Not completely hammered  But close to it  You'll have to do that  When he can start drinking  Steve's first shot 
[01:39:30]  Live on the air  Let's go to Liz  Liz what's up  Hey I love you guys  By the way  Thank you  Thank you Liz  Listen I had that operation  On four years ago  And I'm cracking up over here  When he's saying right now  That he can't drink  First of all  I was almost 300 pounds  I got down to 105  And you were almost 400  Almost 300  Oh and you're down to 105 now  Yeah  Nice  I'm five foot two  You lost 200 pounds  Yeah I did  Wow  You were five two and 300 pounds  Yeah  Wow 
[01:40:00]  That's slob  I was really fast  Plastic surgery after this was all done too  I tried that  They won't let me do it  They won't let me do it  Because your skin does get loose  You gotta exercise  Where the hell is that skin  Is that what I want to go  Is it still there  My arms I have a problem with  Because my arms  Were always big  So I like  I don't wear like  Sleeveless shirts  I'm real funny about my arms  If you just jump off the roof  Can you fly to the tree  In the middle of the yard  No it's not that bad Anthony  Like the flying squirrel  They have no propulsion  Or real lift  They just use their  No it's not that bad 
[01:40:30]  I weight lift  I try to get my arms going  It's not as bad  It could be better  Especially the size I'm in now  Work all this time  To get to the size  And I can't wear  You know  A bikini or anything like that  But  It's better than being fat  Oh yeah right  At least your health  Is probably a lot better  Hell yeah  It's 100% better  My self esteem  Everything  But the drinking  Goes away  After a while  You could drink some beer  Like I gained some weight  From drinking the beer back  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  I don't eat much  But I can drink  But there's no room 
[01:41:00]  For the beer to go  There will be  It does stretch out  No that's not true  It stretches out a little bit  It does stretch out  And that's the one  Drawback to this  To this operation  Some people figure out  How to drink high calorie liquids  Like a lot of booze  And a lot of ice cream  And they don't lose any weight  They are  I don't eat  It's the purpose  Yeah wow  The thing is  Fluids go right through  Fluids don't break up  Fluids go right through  So you can drink  And  Billy  Have you stopped  Losing weight  No  I'm actually just  I hit a plateau  For about a month or so there  I was hanging out  Around 270  Now I'm in the low 260s  And it used to be what

[01:59:00]  So Tyson fought  Yes  Tyson fought  This  Danish guy  And  And he was just this big  Fat  Waste  Of a  Life  And he gets out there  And  And pretty much got beaten up by Mike Tyson  For seven rounds or so  No  What I don't understand  Why aren't we throwing Tyson parties nowadays  At least you would get a party in  Well  The  The  The  The guys doing the commentary on the fight  They have Steve Albert  And  What's his name 
[01:59:30]  Was it George Foreman  Bobby Chez  Bobby Chez  Who  I mean  I think he's gonna do a good job this evening  Oh that guy  That guy got the snot knocked down  Of course he did  He could just hear  I think Tyson  Has seen better days  But  He could see a good day  Today  What  What are you saying  Yes  My brother is a pervert  Yes  Steve Albert  No he's a pervert  We know  We know Marv's a perv  So  Yeah I mean this fought 
[02:00:00]  Lasted a while  Yeah it did  We had a nice little party  Mike Tyson went  You know  Just about  I guess  They finished the beginning of the seventh round  The guy just got pummeled  But in the old days  Yeah you would  Get everyone together  You'd pay a lot of money  To get the pay per view  For  30 seconds  To just watch Tyson come out  And beat the crap out of somebody  They're down on the canvas  Somebody's taking a leak  And they missed the fight  There was always somebody  That missed it  I got the classic story  When I was living in Rochester  With Buzzy  You've met 
[02:00:30]  Oh yeah  We have tons of fun  Buzzy stories  Was it fuzzy and spuds  No no  This was pre-spuds day  We threw a Tyson party  Yeah  When he fought Spinks  I believe  And what was  Oh great  Was it 31 seconds  Or something like that  Getting your money's worth  On that one  And we were broke at the time  So we came up with this great idea  We'll have a Tyson fight party  And we'll invite all our friends  And you know  The excuse was  Give us 5, 10 bucks  At the door for the beer  And the pot  And everything else  We had flown in that house 
[02:01:00]  At JC's house  Ah  The house we almost burnt down  Story for another day  And we set up the whole place  On the lawn in the back  We set up a whole living room  Complete with TVs  Lamps  Rugs  Couches  And a crowd that yells  Congratulations  No  And Buzzy's like  He's a whiz of this stuff  We had probably 20 TVs  Throughout the whole house  I mean it was set  For this freaking fight  Yeah  31 seconds 
[02:01:30]  People wanted their money back  How do you want your money back?  You knew what you were getting  Especially at that point  You knew Tyson's just a frigging animal  Comes out of the corner  And just starts swinging  And kills people  No I was just going to say  This fight  He came charging out  About 18, 20 pounds heavier  Than he's ever been for a fight  To go up against this  Just fat  Disgusting  Waste of a fighter  Like Tyson  And the announcers were saying it  They'd been padding  Some of his competitors  He's not fighting the contenders 
[02:02:00]  And he's not going to get  A real title shot  Until he does that  And he put on this extra weight  And he just bludgeoned this guy  For  The guy can take a punch  The guy  I was amazed  He stood up  But  And then Tyson  You know  Just pounded him  Body  Pounded the face  The guy went down once  He head butted him  Cut his eye open  And he said that  He couldn't see anymore  And he couldn't come out  For one of the rounds  Because he couldn't see  Through his left eye 
[02:02:30]  That Tyson just put  His bald head into  And then at one point  He faked  Getting hit by a low blow  Tyson winds up  Hits him low  In the abdomen  But nowhere near his sack  And the guy just goes  Made this sound  Buckles over  Because he needed more time to rest  For some reason  They got some rule  That if you get a low blow  And it's unintentional  You can take five minutes  Between the rounds  So he just took a few breaths  After about three minutes  He went back in  To get beat up some more  Tyson  Not as impressive  As I've seen him  In the past  But 
[02:03:00]  Who am I to say  I'd have been down  Just looking at him  He is one scary individual  Praise be to  God  That's what he says now  After the fight  Praise be to  God  I don't want to say  Allah  People just starting to like Mike  I can't say to Allah  Praise be to  White Jesus  And how do you spell Allah  Mike  Allah  Is that a B  No no no 
[02:03:30]  L  And a sign  For chloride  By the way  People say the Tyson thing  Sounds better  Through the microphone  Yeah  Okay  Oh I forgot  They showed a clip of me  From England  The day I was yelling  At people through the bullhorn  I was talking to someone  This weekend  They said that to me  Like you know  I love the show  Love what you guys are doing  But one slight critique  When Anthony does Tyson  It's much better  When he does it  Through the microphone  Who's Anthony  And what do you mean  Doing Tyson  This was when I was in England 
[02:04:00]  And I said some bad things  And the English peoples  Was protesting  Outside my hotel room  So I addressed the crowd  With the bullhorn  To try to calm them down  And ease their nerves  About having a convicted felon  In their country  Hello people of England  Your queen is a whore  Lady Di would have bled more  If I F'd her in the A  Yeah  But they got mad 
[02:04:30]  I didn't understand  I thought I was bonding  With them  Your old queen  Is a whore  Her boobs are sweat socks  Full of sand  That I could use as a speed bag  While she suck it  But yeah  I had my fight  I fought the big fat guy  Well let's listen to  He was nothing  Let's play some clips  From the other night  Mike  This is the Danish guy  Oh this is the Danish guy 
[02:05:00]  Now this is after the fight  This guy  You know  English isn't his first language  But  I could understand him  A hell of a lot better  Before the fight  Than after  Before he was like  You know  And it's going to be  A little difficult  I think I have things to do  And I will try to stay away  From Tyson  And then  Here is him  After the fight  I defy you to understand him  Are you proud of your performance  You were an awful game fighter  This evening  No I'm not proud  Because  I want to 
[02:05:30]  I want to go to the system  Wow  He sounded like  Superfly  Jimmy Snuka  That sounds funny  That was funny  I saw some  Gray woozy stuff  Coming out his ear  Now I realize  It was his brain  Brain  TQZ  And number 5  Thank you  Alright what's the next one  Another Danish guy  Another from the Danish guy  You wanted the fight  To be stopped  The referee came over  And asked you  And you said  You had enough  No  I don't say that  I stopped the fight  You stopped the fight 
[02:06:00]  You were ready to continue  Yeah  Every time he hit me hard  On the left eyes  I can nothing see  And that's  What you say  Yeah  That's bullshit  Because if he knocked me out  He wanted to never knock me out  I can take everything  I believe that  And I have never been down  And he wanted to never get me down  Oh my god  I could see it  I could see it  Right when the first round started  He looked scared  When he came out  All of a sudden  He looked around  He was looking for that 
[02:06:30]  Australian wildlife guy  To put a dart in me  He had the look of fear  On his face  The last time he saw something  Come at him like that  I think he was behind  A pickup truck  When they were re-releasing  A bear to its natural habitat  Habitat  Habitat  O-C-L  No it's  And one of the signs  On the Zoso cover  Of Led Zeppelin  It starts with an H  What was that little squiggly line  Oh H 
[02:07:00]  Okay  Alright  Thanks for the head start  Alright forget  H  B  Nine  Alright what's the next clip  Another Danish guy  Another Danish guy  Well you went down  You went down in that third round  Yeah  What happened there  No  Yeah I'm out of bed  I said he hit me  Because he hit hard  And not hard knock  To knock me out  He hit hard  The guy says he was off balance  And he hit him  He smashed this guy  In the face  So hard  He went right down  On his ass 
[02:07:30]  And Mike Tyson  Hovered over him  And just looked at him  And the guy looked up  And I swear to god  His glance  Immediately  He had to turn his head  Like he didn't want to look  Sitting on his ass  Up at Mike Tyson  Of course  With you  Most people  That are head level  With my midsection  Have the same look  Of fear  But usually  They are women  The only thing  That surprised me  When a situation  Like that  Is I don't get  Sprayed in the face 
[02:08:00]  With mace  Which did happen  And this time  I built up  An immunity  To mace  Immunity  R-9-9-Chevy-Chevette  No?  No  I can do it next time  Alright  What's the next clip?  More Danish guys  Sound like Corky  A lot of people will say  I mean  You took a tremendous  Tremendous beating  And you managed  To maintain  In fact  Even in the 6th round  When you were  Getting hit  You had somewhat 
[02:08:30]  Of an attitude  Is what Bobby Chess said  Were you  Were you a little defiant?  What?  Yes  Yes  Definitely  English is not  Your first language  And I apologize  Okay  What will you do next?  I hope I get a chance  More that's bullshit  I don't get him  I mean I have my title  So I want to defend that  And I hope  Tyson won him  Fight me again  And next time  I beat him  Nice and fight again  You want that again?  Yeah  Of course I want that  Oh my god  What an idiot 
[02:09:00]  He didn't even know  What defiant meant  What a buffoon  What an ignoramus  LQHF5916  Defiant  Which of course means  Not too fiant  See you're defiant  That means don't be fiant  Fiant  Wait you know 
[02:09:30]  9P  Squiggly line  Dash dot dot  Jerry  Yeah  Hey what's up?  I swear to god  If JFK goes into  Hello this is NFL  Redskins radio  Stop it  Again  I swear to god  Have they yet?

I was the listener  In Jersey for two years  And then I moved  Down to Florida  In the military  And then I came back  Up here  And I was stoked  When you guys  Finally got syndicated  I don't understand 
[02:10:30]  Why we're being  When did they cut out?  They cut out  548  Yeah 548  Defiant  He can't  I'll do it for you  He can't even say  Defiant  That blows  Alright bro  Thanks  Alright guys  That sucks  They should play  For three hours  They should show  That clip of Taylor  Breaking Theismann's leg  And then play  A laugh track  Oh gosh  That really annoys me  The next game  That I'm guys  I don't mind 
[02:11:00]  That you know  People want to hear  The game  But a three hour pregame  For a team that blows  Yeah  Both teams  Well  They both got  Fabulous what  0-4 records  Ah that blows  Man  Eh  We were having fun too  Poor Washington  We still have fun  You did  Yeah Washington stinks  I'm really glad  That the show 
[02:11:30]  Is not being broadcast  Right now  In Washington D.C.  Yeah that's gonna kill us  Why  Alright so  What's this clip  One more Danish  One more Danish guy  The guy that can't talk  What makes you think  You could beat the guy  After what you just went through  What makes you think  You could ever win a fight  Like this  I get another cut  And I never get a cut  And nothing can see  And I  You couldn't see anything  That's  Do that from my eyes  Every time he hit me  It looks like a T-100  And my eyes 
[02:12:00]  I couldn't see  I did not  I did not  I did not  I did not  I did not  We've overlooked  The obvious  Why didn't Tyson  Punch Jim Gray  In that big huge forehead  Of his  After the fight  I like to go out  And celebrate  I find the tallest building  And climb it  With a beautiful blonde  And when they send  The biplanes  It's easy  I swatted them  And then I wait  A couple hit me  I go  Ah  You know  And then I start  Bleeding a little bit 
[02:12:30]  But it's all for the show  And then I fall off  The building  For his beauty  Killed the beef  Alright what's the next one  One more Danish guy  Brian you fought a good fight  I hope that  We've enjoyed our time  Here at Denmark  Congratulations  He said  That's everything for me  He said he  Is that what Mike told you  You took everything for me  I'm a good fighter  And a hard hitter  Indeed you are  Thank you  Thank you Brian  Thank you  He's a hard hitter 
[02:13:00]  With his face on my fist  That's where he was  Hitting hard  I did not like  The people over there  In Denmark  Where the fight was  I did not like  Those people  They booed Mike Tyson  When they came out  And you remember  What happened the last time  The crowd booed me  I snapped my chains  And ran rampant  And bit through subway cars  Unloading the passengers  Into my mouth  Remember  Remember  And that little guy  Came running out  Going  Stop taking the pictures 
[02:13:30]  Don't yell  Don't yell  Don't worry  Those chains are made  Of high pencil steel  Yeah  Bull  Crap  I broke that  In no time  And then I trotted  Through the subway cars  You see the look of horror  On the subway car driver's face  When I popped up  Through the bottom  Of the tracks  That's one of the best scenes  In my home movies  He go  Look it's Mike Tyson's big head  In the middle of the tracks  And I grab it  I peel the top open  And empty the contents  In my mouth  That's what I said 
[02:14:00]  Mouth  M-O-F  I can spell mouth  I'm not stupid  Hey  Terry what's up  Hey  Oh  Hey  Love the show  Man  Hey Opie  I just want to say  I really love  The way you do  Those Tyson imitations  Oh no  Man  I can't wait  For him to come to town  And meet you in person  That's going to be great  This is what I do  For the show  I can figure out  A girl's age  By looking at her taint  And I have a horrible  Sports curse  Anthony  Does the Tyson impression 
[02:14:30]  Anthony  Anthony  I feel bad about them  The disaster that happened too  Because if you remember  When I grabbed Jessica Lange  It was so much easier  Climbing the Twin Towers  When I made that movie  Because I could step  Between the two  And I went up  The only problem is  There wasn't no biplanes  There was fighter planes  And helicopters  And they hurt Mike  A little more  But I was training for that  And I knew it was coming 
[02:15:00]  Alright what do we got next  Are we done with  The Danish guy clips  I want to hear what  Tyson had to say  After the fight  Jeff Bridges is a pussy  You see him  He's buried out  I took his chick away  And he couldn't do  Nothing about it  And Charles Grodin  When he had the hair  What a pussy  Alright what do we got  This is Tyson  After the fight  Tyson after the fight 
[02:15:30]  I've been training in the gym  For a long period of time  Putting a lot around the boxing  And I'm just  All praise be to God  That he made me healthy enough  To perform well  And I like to say  I love all my children  My family  Shawn and Monica  Maida  Everyone  I'm back  And I just look forward  To the fight again  He was a tough guy  It was hard to hit him  But it was good  I got those seven rounds  Alright there he goes  Praise be to  I got to be more politically correct 
[02:16:00]  People don't like when I say  Praise be to Mickey Mouse  Man that's not offensive  Everyone loves Mickey  Praise be to Goofy  Praise be to Bugs Bunny  You used to say praise to all of them  No I didn't  Shut up  I never said that  I don't want people to hate Mike  You know the rape thing is one thing  But terrorism never  What is this one?  This was on Brian Yeltsin's fight  Oh okay  Well he's a big guy  And I wanted to put on more weight  To put more leverage in my punching  And he was successful in doing so 
[02:16:30]  I was laying hard shots  And he was taking  And I was saying  God when he came to the ring  I asked him  You shouldn't have quit  You should have kept fighting man  You was putting on a hell of a fight  I needed more weight  Behind my punches  Because they're not devastating enough  That's great  My arms are like bunker busters  And his belly were a bunker  Yeah it's just  It's always fun to watch that guy fight  I don't care  And the announcers are bashing 
[02:17:00]  Like ah it's not the Mike Tyson of the past  And he's got to fight some better people and stuff  But I swear to God  I just love watching that guy fight  Because he comes out  Just full of all the anger of being him  And unloads on the guy  Great job  A lot of the pay per views  Are no longer  They're on free or TV now  That's probably why you don't have the Tyson parties anymore  Yeah yeah  It was on Showtime  They had the whole thing on Showtime  So yeah  It was cool though  Great to watch  Can't wait for the next one  Hopefully it's not as long  I think he fought a year ago or something 
[02:17:30]  Why is the Frenchie guy raising his hand?  What's up Frenchie?  One day he's going to come in that door over here  And kick your ass?  Not me  Who's doing the oppression?  I will still end there  I believe it's Opie right?  What's an oppression?  An oppression  They're used to that  Being oppressed by the Nazis  Who's doing that Tyson oppression?  Come on, stop with the Nazis, god damn it  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Yeah, the Magido line  You know what I mean?  Frenchie, people are driving all over this country  Just chuckling and laughing at you  I'm sure  You were so funny right there

And you turned around and said  Like I give a ass  And walked away  That's not a fight  It's you being rude  A fight involves two people  Trading barbs or punches  Or whatever it is  You were just being a rude person  To my sister  That's correct  It wasn't a fight  It was you being rude

Bye  Bye  Alright  Calm down there  Calm down there  Okay so here's the first song  From John Valby  That he sent  Where's the song now  We need it  Alright  This is the first one he sent  Now  John actually had an excuse for this song  Usually there's a story behind it  He needed an excuse for it  Because it kind of got ripped apart  By us and the listeners  It was right after September 11th 
[02:30:30]  It was full of patriotism  And wanting revenge  So instead of making a real goof song  He kind of tried making this  Patriotic song  I don't know  It didn't fit the  The John Valby motif  I don't think  Today we were attacked  9-11-2001  And as they cheer in the streets of Palestine  They cry in the streets of New York 
[02:31:00]  But today we stand as Americans  Still proud  Angry  Yeah  But we will not give in  We will not kill innocent people 
[02:31:30]  For our revenge  Oh really?  America  They come into America  Freedom  And justice  My country  Tis of thee  Sweet land of liberty  What's coming to Osama  Today  Today  All you Islamic jihad  Oh  Get saucy there  James  Forever in blue jeans 
[02:32:00]  We're gonna get ya  Well you can run all day  And hide all night  Oh sound been alive  Now we're ready to fight  Gonna get ya  Gonna get ya  Gonna get ya  You can hide in the basement  Hide in the cave  But the game ain't over  So you're in your grave  Gonna get ya  Gonna get ya  When New York smoked  The band got burned  Osama bin Laden  Now it's your turn  Gonna get ya  Don't know if I will 
[02:32:30]  But until I can find it  The innocent died  Because you're hatin'  Osama bin Laden  You're the real Satan  You don't bring me flowers  Anymore  The heart came down on the street today  But freedom still stands in the USA  Disco Valby  I love it  Woo  Towers came down on the street today  But freedom still stands in the USA  And it just fades out  This song should have 
[02:33:00]  Congratulations yelled at the end of it  Alright so he openly admitted that it sucked  And it was a spur of the moment  Spur of the moment type of song  Right  I think he was drunk  Yeah we know  So then he came back  John Valby  And Valby style  Yes  With this little number  I know guys  Name's Osama  But Afghanistan  Is his mama 
[02:33:30]  He's hiding in a cave  In a  Pajama  With the snob  And the crack  Of a crusty old mama  Ain't been a lot  But it ain't been a lot  Oh  We got dead Taliban  Blue  Love on the rocks  They hate the USA  And what we stand for  So the Taliban's declaring  A holy war  When our bombs begin to hit  The only thing they'll be declaring  Is holy  Hey Bin Laden  Hey Bin Laden  Hey Bin Laden 
[02:34:00]  Oh  Oh my god damn Taliban  Hey Osama  George W. Bush  Is a loving guy  And he knows you're lonely  That's the reason why  He's given a national monument  To be your companion  Gonna turn your cave  Into the Grand Canyon  Hey Bin Laden  Hey  Hey Bin Laden  It rhymes 
[02:34:30]  Oh my god damn Taliban  All right, one more  Five times a day  They stop and pray  But soon they'll be bound  To the USA  And all you bastards 
[02:35:00]  That support jihad  Open your mouth  Here comes Uncle Sam's  Hey Bin Laden  Hey Bin Laden  Hey Bin Laden  Bin Laden  Hog  I think it was hog  And that one just fades out  All right  So that was the second one  John Valby sent us  Ouch  A little better than the first, right?  Oh wow, the first one  Yeah, that was a little much  The first one gets you motivated  Oh, it does?  To what?  Turn it off  The second one was better  Oh, well, thank you, Frenchy  Thank you very much 
[02:35:30]  I heard the first one  I just shadowboxed a little  All right  And here's the John Valby poem  All right  And then finally  The brand new one from Valby  Here's to Osama Bin Laden  That towelhead scum  May the U.S. blast his ass  To Kim Jong-un  He's a bagless wonder  That lives in the cave  May Marines 
[02:36:00]  But we're going to get you  On that  Buttweiser on that  Suckers guy  Osama being a chicken  Suckers bag  Lives off camel turds  With a topping of maggots  Osama thinks we don't have the guts  To come and blow off  His Islamic nuts  But now America  Is done with his crap  So let's just  Move the  Suckers off the map  So here's to Osama
