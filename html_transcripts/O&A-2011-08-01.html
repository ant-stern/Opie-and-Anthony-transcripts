<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' signature boisterous introduction and self-deprecating banter, immediately transitioning into a discussion of the D.B. Cooper case, fueled by recently discovered evidence.  An unidentified third person in the studio joined the hosts in wildly speculating about Cooper's motives, the hijacking details, and the significance of the newfound fingerprints and DNA from a tie, all seasoned with copious amounts of vulgar and offensive jokes.

The conversation then abruptly shifted to the debt ceiling debate, with the hosts expressing their frustration and lack of understanding of the complexities of the issue through crude language and cynical humor.  Callers Phil and Grant attempted to offer explanations of fractional reserve banking and additional information from a D.B. Cooper documentary, respectively, both met with mockery from the hosts.  The discussion eventually moved to the Nassau County Coliseum funding vote, prompting Opie to unleash a tirade of highly offensive language against the potential tax increase and Islanders owner Charles Wang.  A contentious phone call with a listener, Donnie, further fueled this debate. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the Coliseum vote, general frustration with politicians and taxes, and cynicism about the sports industry.

The next segment began with a caller's car radio preferences, swiftly transitioning to a discussion about Apple's financial success, including humorous suggestions about making Steve Jobs president. This led to a "FU Line" segment featuring listener-submitted audio clips detailing various life frustrations, including a serious allegation of sexual assault.  A humorous anecdote about a Radio Shack employee's surprisingly effective tech support followed.  The show then promoted Danny McBride's upcoming guest appearance and a *Eastbound & Down* DVD giveaway, sparking a discussion about the difference between "profane" and "profound."  A news story about a Ground Zero worker receiving a zero-dollar settlement check prompted outrage, followed by a personal anecdote about a $1.08 insurance check. Opie confessed to cheating in college by paying someone to write his papers.

The hosts then debated the referee's decision in the Fedor Emelianenko vs. Dan Henderson fight, transitioning into commentary on female MMA fighters and their physical attributes. A tense call with a listener, Tom, ensued, centered on interruptions in conversations. The segment concluded with discussions of a BB gun-shot weather reporter continuing her report and a news crew's physical altercation with a hoarder, leading to comments about the decline of journalistic integrity.  A story about an eight-year-old driving his drunk father's truck ended the segment.

The following segment started with the "hilarious" mugshot of a drunk 28-year-old man.  A scathing critique of Kings of Leon followed, focusing on show cancellations attributed to heat exhaustion (and pigeon droppings), using highly offensive language to describe the band members.  This was interspersed with a sexually suggestive and offensive bit about Uncle Paul, a recurring character, and promotions for Sirius XM programs, including one mocking fishing.  More details about internal Kings of Leon conflicts emerged, fueled by caller input about the lead singer's past painkiller use. The hosts then discussed the authenticity of sports memorabilia before transitioning to Meatloaf's on-stage collapse and Amy Winehouse's posthumous chart success.  One host shared a personal anecdote about a chafed taint, leading to crude jokes.  A heated, homophobic exchange with a Long Island caller followed.

The show then speculated on Kelsey Grammer's possible mayoral run and criticized reality TV shows like "The Real Housewives," "Toddlers & Tiaras," and "Dance Moms," using derogatory terms to describe the participants.  A significant portion focused on mocking a young "Toddlers & Tiaras" contestant, Mackenzie. The segment concluded with more discussion of swim trunks and netting, a return to the argument with the Long Island caller, a brief discussion about a workplace conflict, a musical interlude, and promotion of an Elvis impersonator and "Butt Trek."

The penultimate segment heavily critiqued the trailer for "Crazy Stupid Love," using highly offensive and sexually explicit language to express their distaste for its predictability and Steve Carell's acting.  This led to a broader discussion about body-switching movies and Hollywood's lack of realistic sexual scenarios, punctuated by more vulgar and offensive comments. The hosts discussed other movies and television shows, with a caller mentioning "Bad News Bears," and a comparison between the original and remake.  Discussions of "Hall Pass" and "Pearl Harbor" ensued, along with a caller's kangaroo attack anecdote.  An extended discussion about a woman they observed, using explicit descriptions, was included. The segment concluded with a Steven Singer Jewelers commercial and further discussion, including an airport anecdote.

The final segment began with a discussion of a friend's experience at a "gay conversion" camp, expanding into conversations about family acceptance of gay individuals, particularly within Hispanic culture, including an anecdote about a flamboyant family friend who was a drug dealer.  The conversation returned to the Fedor Emelianenko fight, followed by a demonstration of MMA submission holds by Fedor on Jim Norton, leading to humorous and uncomfortable interactions.  The introduction of conspiracy theorist Troy quickly shifted to a discussion of his active dating life after he showed the hosts a nude photo.  The hosts, Jim Norton, and Eric Nagel engaged in frank and crude discussions about Troy's sexual activity, including a near-miss pregnancy scare and anecdotes related to contraception and female behavior. The show concluded with further discussion of dating strategies and personal relationship experiences.

[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  O.P. and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony show.  Everything's out of control.  What the hell?  What the hell?  O.P. and Anthony show.  Your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened  to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the O.P. and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, O.P. and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  I resent Larry not knowing my name.  I don't believe it.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Now, I know here on a Monday, the big story that we're all obsessing over.  What's that?  Is the fact that there may be a lead in the D.B. Cooper.  Oh, I know.  I read that.  That is all I've been thinking of all weekend. 
[00:04:30]  Absolutely.  Is that D.B. Cooper?  They got some fingerprints, and they're going to match them up with D.B. Cooper's fingerprints?  DNA, too.  Off his tie.  Off his tie.  So what?  They're on to a guy?  And it's somebody that they won't say whether he's living or dead or who he is, but it's  somebody who's never been brought up in connection with this.  He better be alive.  How great would it be to see D.B. Cooper 40 years later?  What is the...  I would think after all this time, though, he wouldn't even...  He would have come forward.  Oh, D.B.?  In this age of reality TV and the fact that you could write books and make all kinds 
[00:05:00]  of money, this motherfucker would have been like, yeah, that was me.  Every once in a while, there's a real man out there who doesn't give a shit about anything.  He's a hero among us and said, fuck all that.  I'll bet you he's related.  I bet you.  I wonder if he's related to one of the pilots or something.  You know, I'm guessing that what if he comes out and says that he was the brother of one  of the pilots or the cousin of one of the pilots, which would explain why he could never  come forward because that would implicate the person on it. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, but they said this person's never been connected with the case before.  I think it was B.T.  Tetley, actually.  Wow.  D.B.  Cooper.  Oh, brother.  D.B.  Cooper.  Oh, brother.  So where are we at with D.B.  Cooper?  What do we find out?  It might take a little while for testing to be done.  They're not saying.  The FBI today revealed that it believes it has America's most elusive.  Wow.  This story is saying they believe they have most elusive fugitive finally in its sights  40 years after famed hijacker D.B.  Cooper disappeared when he jumped out of a plane over Washington. 
[00:06:00]  What a great story, man.  Investors at Gator said they are testing the fingerprints of a new suspect after what they  said is the most promising lead to date in its bid to crack America's only unsolved hijacking.  40 years.  That's the most promising lead to date.  That's the impressive part.  Do the kids today know the D.B.  Cooper story?  Because it is a great one.  It's like a legend.  Yeah.  You would think it's legendary, but I wonder.  I think they kind of know him.  I mean, it shows you how different flying was back then, too. 
[00:06:30]  He gets on a plane.  Yeah.  And he says he has a bomb.  And what does he want to do?  He wants to land in Seattle, release some passengers, and then take off again from Mexico.  Correct.  A flight from Portland to Seattle, yeah.  He said he had a bomb.  And back then, the planes opened from the rear.  Once in a while, I was on a flight recently that had the rear cone open.  Really?  It had the stairs on the back.  It might have been a Delta flight, but you can see where it ends in the back.  So he said you have to fly below 10,000 feet.  And I guess they opened somewhere along the route. 
[00:07:00]  Or maybe he kept it open the whole route.  And then just jumped at one point.  With his parachutes that he demanded.  Parachutes and his $200,000.  At night in the rain.  He demanded four parachutes, though.  Did he use all four parachutes?  No, he wouldn't have.  I don't mean to.  Yeah, he got different types of parachutes.  So I guess he was able to pick and choose.  To figure out which one will work.  Yeah.  Which one's like the best one to use.  Yeah, it was at night in the rain.  And they found $5,000 in that money almost 6,000 years later. 
[00:07:30]  Like nine years later.  Yeah, in the Columbia River.  Yeah, some kids found it.  So they probably just fell out while he was.  But the fact that no body or nothing.  I mean, maybe out there you could get lost.  They said he fucked up because they gave him 20s.  Like he wanted a smaller denomination.  So it was so much money.  It was like a big, heavy bag of money.  Instead of getting it in hundreds.  Which would have been a fraction of the size.  He probably started throwing money out before he took, you know.  Yeah, before he jumped.  Get him off the trail. 
[00:08:00]  He probably realized, you know what?  I can't fucking take all this with me.  I'm going to have a crash landing.  That might be.  You know what?  That might be what the four parachutes were for.  He might have tied the.  Oh, no.  How would you pull the.  Right.  That's true.  Right.  No.  How would you pull.  Maybe he had the whole thing.  Realize he was falling too fast and decide to start throwing money.  Maybe.  Who knows.  But yeah, they might.  They might have a lead on a guy.  That's cool as hell, man.  Yeah.  Because he bought the ticket under Don Cooper.  I guess. 
[00:08:30]  No ID back then.  They didn't search you.  Oh, they're just smoking a cigarette, walking on the plane.  Hey, how you doing?  No TSA.  Yeah.  Oh, God, no.  I got my briefcase.  A briefcase would bomb in it.  Yeah.  There's a ticking briefcase.  Look at your clock.  You forgot your clock.  You know, there was some airline employee, I think on Northwest, who pulled out a gun and  shot because he wanted to commit suicide, but he wanted to kill everybody.  So he was an employee, so he didn't have to go through security, so he popped one of  the pilots with a gun.  Damn.  And the plane went down. 
[00:09:00]  That's years ago, obviously.  Fine.  We'll have to wait and see.  I mean, I don't want him to be caught ever.  I'd like them to find him.  Now, isn't there a statute of limitations on that?  You'd think there would be.  It's not...  Here's the guy, but we can't do anything.  That would be the perfect ending, because you do want to see him, but...  I guess they'd have to put him in jail.  I don't know.  Well, that hit over the weekend, I guess, or yesterday, late yesterday, so...  Maybe, like, skyjacking, there isn't a statute on there.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  And nobody died.  He didn't hurt anybody. 
[00:09:30]  It's not a federal thing.  The incredible lead is somebody whose possible connection to the hijacker is strong.  So some asshole ratted him out.  Connection to the hijacker.  He probably is dead, though.  Maybe a deathbed fucking confession from somebody else.  You know?  Hey, by the way...  My husband...  Oh, yeah.  And here's some of the money.  We have some of the money.  He would only be about...  How old was he at the time?  He was a younger guy, right?  Say he was 31.  I'm going to guess...  He'll be 71.  Yeah.  Yeah.  72 years old.  That's definitely doable. 
[00:10:00]  Absolutely.  I say he's alive.  I say the guy's alive that they're looking at.  Get him on Leno.  Letterman.  Do the whole talk show circuit.  Write a book.  He's famous.  Yeah, I mean...  His book would probably be boring, except for the one chapter called The Flight.  Could you imagine that?  It's just him hanging out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watch TV today.  The whole book is about the airport.  And things...  Like the little shops he went into at the airport.  Duty free.  He loves it.  And the one chapter you care about is really thin. 
[00:10:30]  Really thin.  Just very thin with a lot of pictures.  And he's just a horrible person.  Like you realize, like, wow, this guy's a folk hero?  Yeah.  And he's just talking about like...  So I went into the duty free thing and I saw some horrible yarmulke Jews buying some  things to take back.  And he just starts attacking every race and religion.  But not in a funny way.  He's just an angry, unhappy guy.  He's like, oh man, I can't support this guy anymore.  This guy's a dick.  He's an asshole.  This guy's terrible.  T.P. Coop is a prick. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I saw a really hot baby in a stroller.  I winked at it.  It winked at me.  I got distracted.  You know, just creepy.  And in news, we all saw coming.  They, what, did the debt ceiling thing?  Of course.  That's why I didn't pay attention to that shit.  Panicky Pete bullshit.  Yeah, we'll just keep raising that until the whole fucking thing collapses on itself.  And then we have to get our guns and hunt for our food.  That's right.  But of course they were going to figure some shit out.  Of course.  They're not going to let it fucking lapse. 
[00:11:30]  It was his last minute political wrangling that was going on.  And yeah, they knew there would have been a problem.  I guess the market's going to do good today, huh?  Gibbs, Obama, 2.5 trillion hike in debt limit.  Like, what the fuck?  And I was, we were driving in today and I'm like, everyone's doing their job in this country.  I see a ton of people going to work to fucking pay their taxes.  Yeah.  Why can't the government figure this shit out? 
[00:12:00]  I just, I don't know what it means.  I like talking basics.  Someone would come on and explain it to us, but it's just ridiculous.  You saw people out and about spending money and working and going about their lives.  What the fuck has changed?  Yeah, what's different now?  It doesn't make sense.  I don't understand what the difference in my life is.  I don't know how finance works.  I admit, I obviously don't.  But I mean, like, well, you know, interest rates were lowered, so the debt ceiling went down a little bit.  But, you know, we're in debt. 
[00:12:30]  Who gives a shit if we're, I don't care what we owe.  Yeah, what do we owe?  What does that mean?  Yeah.  I know it means something, but I'm saying what?  I don't know.  I just don't understand it.  It's like, oh, well, we can't send these government checks out.  Why not?  The bank will cash them.  Do you know, I actually, this is what we do.  When they say the balance, the budget is balanced, I only go good because everyone else says it's good.  If people had always said to me, like, I can't believe they're trying to balance the budget, I would have been right there.  Why would they do that? 
[00:13:00]  I don't get it.  But now it's a good thing.  Yeah.  I don't know what that means even.  The fuck knows.  I mean, I'm sweet.  I just don't have the smarts.  Yeah, there's people that know all this shit.  There's formulas that go with it.  Yeah, the formulas are flawed.  Oh, shit.  They're flawed.  But they figured it out.  Of course they were going to figure it out.  Oh, yeah.  It means we're just continue to be in trouble, but.  Giant debt.  I think the Republicans got the better part of the deal as far as what they wanted and 
[00:13:30]  what their people wanted.  Did they?  Yeah.  Like, give a fuck.  Raising the debt ceiling, cutting some money, but not really taxing the shit out of people  like the Democrats wanted on their side.  Isn't there weird things that got declared new taxes?  Like, I forget.  Something like if certain jobs.  Not taxes.  Revenues.  They call them revenues now.  It doesn't sound like you're being taxed.  But there are certain things that are considered new tax and revenue that really aren't. 
[00:14:00]  I wish I had an example.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, no, I don't.  I just said that and had nothing to follow up with.  So basically, I'm like every.  I'll believe you, though.  I'm like every asshole friend at a party.  Like, dude, the fucking, you know, there's some things they say.  This is the type of thing Bob Kelly would say.  You know what, dude?  There's some things, dude, that they say attacks you, but they're not.  Like what?  Come on, dude.  You know.  That stuff, dude.  Whatever, dude.  Don't be shmarmy.  Shmarmy.  Shmarmy. 
[00:14:30]  Let me say out of Mikey in New Orleans.  Mikey.  Good morning, boy.  Morning, Mike.  I've just got on him for a couple years now.  And with the rigs he had to choose from, he took the worst one he could have jumped with.  But he could have made that jump and lived through it.  I really hope he made it.  Why did he pick the worst rig?  It was an older round rig.  It wasn't a square airfoil.  It was an older round rig because it was 40 years ago.  It was probably a modern day rig. 
[00:15:00]  I don't think he had a really old parachute on the plane, you idiot.  40 years ago, it was probably this, it was state-of-the-art.  It still had the tag on it.  Right.  He drove out the back in an ultralight.  What do you think?  It still had that new car smell.  I mean, what are you talking about?  He's gone.  Of course he's gone.  I think he realized how stupid he just was.  Yeah, if you look back now, it looks like an old, horrible rig.  At the time, it's all nice and new.  I mean, if you're a hijacker and they're getting you four parachutes, I think they're going to get you four nice parachutes. 
[00:15:30]  They're not going to fuck around with people's lives, right?  Or that guy is completely right.  I don't know.  I wonder if that's why he got four.  To make the people think, look, I'm taking three people with me.  If you fuck with these chutes, you could kill an innocent person.  Pilots or something.  Because you would think, like, if you ask for a parachute, they'd be like, yeah, make sure you pack that fucking thing with rocks.  Right.  This fucking guy is brilliant.  Oh, God.  Like, everything he did was really, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  You want to see him, but I don't want to see him go to jail.  That's one of those crimes.  He'd be a hero in jail.  He's the type of guy where there's nobody who would fucking treat him bad.  Oh, his first night in, he's raped by a bunch of black guys.  DB who?  DB Pooper.  DB Motherfucker.  Take this shit.  Cooper.  Cooper.  They would think it's D.P. Cooper, and that's how he liked the dick stuck in his old man ass.  D.P. Cooper.  Yeah, double penetration Cooper.  Dick bulge.  Dick bulge Cooper.  Dick bulge Cooper.  They said he might have been killed, though. 
[00:16:30]  Wouldn't the, uh, if you jumped out the back of the plane right there, the fucking rush of the engines, wouldn't that have caused him?  They were flying slow, relatively low for that plane.  Yeah, they knocked the plane down to 10,000 feet for him, right?  Because, uh, yeah, but the whole, uh, at night, in the rain, shit like that, and who knows if he had that kind of experience.  They were thinking he might have been former military or in some way, shape, or form known about, uh, uh, jumping.  Have they reenacted this yet?  Yeah, they've done that.  I've seen some reenactments where people have jumped. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, really?  People have done it?  Yeah, yeah.  Out of that type of plane?  Uh, not that type of plane, no.  But close enough, right?  Yeah, I guess it's, you know, insurance.  You know, they probably have the, our lawyers here.  You can't do that.  Because I'm saying the force of the, uh, those jet engines are still, uh, maybe they don't, maybe they're not right behind you on that kind of plane.  They're not.  It's 7, 727.  Yeah, they're up on the tail, but the stairway drops well below the, uh, the engines.  So, so, I don't think you'd have gotten hit with the jet blast too bad.  Oh, no?  No. 
[00:17:30]  And how long do you fall before you pull the chute?  Probably for a little while.  10,000 feet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's a high jump.  It is high.  But how long do you want to just be falling like that in the dark?  You know, you're just like, meh.  What do you think is you're falling over the fucking, you know what, he could just be in a tree?  Dead?  Yeah, he could just be there dead in a tree.  Just a skeleton.  Might have impaled himself on a tree.  Fucking, uh, eagles have made his skeleton into a nice nest.  Yeah, baby birds are eating at the top of his skull.  Fucking, I think he was calm and he just jumped, can't see shit, and just goes, one, one, hundred. 
[00:18:00]  Two, one, hundred.  Three, one, hundred.  And then fire.  They said he may have jumped as soon as the plane took off at a Portland airport or wherever he was because nobody would expect to find him there.  He may have left really early.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he just walked off the stairs as the thing was on the runway.  Yeah.  He jumped off and landed on the fucking food truck as he was leaving.  Drove home. 
[00:18:30]  Some food.  We got it, Jim.  Phil at Shit Town.  Very old.  He's going to be banned after I read his instant feedback because he insisted on giving it to me 80 times in a row.  Sorry, we don't play that way, sir.  Yeah.  But it is a good feedback, and it's too bad it'll be your last one.  You can never pay the debt back.  Look up fractional reserve banking.  Look it up.  I wrote the article.  You sure did, Jimmy.  You sure did.  Fractional reserve banking simply means that one-tenth of the time that you're going to be doing some banking, the other 90% of the time you're not banking. 
[00:19:00]  You're busy.  And it's not reserved.  No, not at all.  You just walk right in.  Boom.  There you are.  Banking.  I'm doing some banking.  With the current system in place, you can never pay back the debt.  As soon as you create a dollar, you create a dollar more in debt.  Thank you, Phil.  Should we ban him?  I don't know.  I don't know if he's right or not.  He was trying so hard to be informative.  Yeah, he said dollar twice.  Fuck him.  Yeah, fuck him.  All right.  Sorry, Phil.  See you later.  Alan G. 
[00:19:30]  Do you, uh, Greenspan humor?  All right.  It never works.  My bit was working, but now it looks like that guy was right that hung up.  Grant in PA.  What's up, Grant?  Hey, guys.  I just coincidentally watched, like, a Nat Geo documentary on this just last weekend.  Saw it.  They were saying they gave him four shoots.  One was actually dummy.  You can say shit, sir.  This is the satellite.  Go ahead.  Sorry. 
[00:20:00]  The one shoot was, uh, was actually a dummy shoot.  Oh, Kenny's.  And the other shoot was a one that, like, skydivers used, which was more maneuverable, and he picked  the worst of all of them to use an older shoot for that time.  Maybe that's what he was used to, though.  Maybe it was an old military, the round type, and, uh, that's what he was used to because  he had, uh, jumped in, in the big one. 
[00:20:30]  I have no idea.  I'm sure it's like driving a shitty car.  The car still works.  Yeah.  He probably had to be a little more cautious and know what he was doing.  I bet he's, I bet he's dead, and the deathbed confession.  I bet he didn't get away with it.  The deathbed confession is probably from a spouse, and they'll prove who it is by DNA.  Like, it'll be no deathbed by him, because I think he died in the jump.  Maybe someone just, uh, kept D.B. Cooper's toothbrush.  Or anything by him.  They could just get his body.  Just been waiting.  Stole his toothbrush 40 years ago. 
[00:21:00]  DNA.  Ugh.  Never washed it.  They got DNA off the tie, though.  Isn't that fucking amazing?  How the fuck they do that?  And how are they sure it's him, his DNA, and not, like...  Because he left a tie and some cigarette butts.  That they knew.  It had been back then they knew.  Cigarette butts.  That's a plane.  I wonder if they got rid of them or still have them.  They probably got rid of them.  D.B. Cooper's cigarettes.  There was a D.B. Cooper song.  Can you find that, Sam?  I imagine not, but...  Um...  If Danny were here, we'd have it already, but...  It would have been waiting for us?  Is that what you're saying? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We would have opened with it instead of fucking rage.  It would have been the D.B. Cooper song, but...  Now Sam is just beginning to Google.  D, period.  Sam.  He's so nailing you.  A lot of people say he's on an exotic island.  What, with 200 grand from 40 years ago?  Yeah, what?  Doing what?  Eating pebbles?  Maybe open up a little stand.  Selling what?  Like fucking coconuts.  DNA ties.  Tom Snyder.  Says hippie. 
[00:22:00]  47 miles away from where he fell down to his fame.  This guy stinks.  But he told me that the hardest part wasn't really jumping out of that.  Fuck Todd, then.  Todd Snyder.  Don't know how to know.  His floppy hat.  Dope.  He really is a dope.  Less than a minute of free fall for the dude.  That's it?  And they had a place where he was supposedly hiding out and found some of the money.  Just leaving money everywhere. 
[00:22:30]  The money.  Dummy.  Oh.  Ten bucks left when he was finally on the ground walking away.  How great would it be if he actually survived and blew it in Vegas in two days?  Like all these years later we're still wondering.  He's like, no, no, I blew it in blackjack.  I yelled seven, please, and I got a four.  I was 200K in the hole.  I went home.  That's it.  This brings up another question.  How far do you think the news is behind?  Because today it says the FBI is on his trail. 
[00:23:00]  They're going to match up fingerprints.  Now, if I'm D.B. Cooper and I'm reading the news today, I'm like, well, fuck that.  I got to take off again.  Yeah.  Or did they fucking, you know, catch him years ago and maybe he's finally doing the last couple days of his sentencing?  No, he's never, unless it was something else.  But I wonder about this, because why would they release this info if they officially don't have the guy?  That seems really stupid.  Unless he is dead.  Unless he's dead.  The guy they're looking at is dead.  Yeah, but they do this all the time in the news, and I always wonder this.  I forget how.  I think they give us the news a few days behind. 
[00:23:30]  The story got out because somebody, I read something online, a person was interviewing someone in the police about it, about this case.  They're like, well, you know, it's funny you ask, because we actually are looking at somebody new.  You're the first one to hear.  They told the person, you're the first one to hear this, but we're looking at a new suspect.  But, yeah, I wonder if he'd hide out with the money.  Just some old guy now does it tomorrow.  He has his sunglasses on, but a cane.  I'm out of money. 
[00:24:00]  They're on to me.  I got to do this again.  Yeah, but he's not good because he gets fucking, he doesn't know, he brings a Diet Coke on the flight and the TSA won't let him through.  And they pat him down and find he has no bomb.  He's like, I have a bomb!  And they're like, just shut up, old man.  And he sits down.  Doddering old fool.  Exactly.  Take your tie and your DNA and fucking hit the bricks.  And beat it, stupid.  Beat it, stupid.  We're busy.  Put out the cigarette.  Put out the cigarette, sir.  Well, maybe the FBI can fucking help us out and give us more info today.  That would be really nice. 
[00:24:30]  I have a feeling they have, I have a feeling they know, because this is weird for this type of stuff to be coming out with DNA tie-in.  I think they have them.  Imus on the same page as us with this debt thing.  Yeah.  He had Neil Cavuto on.  Cavuto.  Neil Cavuto's one of these dumb talking heads.  He does more of, um.  Is he a Fox guy?  Yeah, he's a Fox guy.  He's not as over-the-top crazy as, like, some of the.  His voice is uncomfortable to listen to.  I never liked listening to Neil Cavuto. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, Imus was on Cavuto.  Imus was on Cavuto?  Imus doesn't go on shows, does he?  Yeah.  Well, that's what the lovely Sam just printed.  What's that about?  I don't know.  Imus doesn't do shit.  He barely does his show at this point.  I just wandered in.  I sat down.  Okay.  So, what do you think of what's going on here?  I mean, this is as cynical as it gets.  I think it makes a good TV show. 
[00:25:30]  Everybody I talk to, on the ranch here, people up from Albuquerque and the crew, nobody's,  the only people following this are people sitting at home wearing their Pinheads and Patriots  t-shirt, mouth breathers, eating up macaroni in the microwave, and waiting for you to tell  them what's going on.  Nobody's, this is a, this is nonsense.  It's a television show.  It's called Budget Brawl.  You're hosting it.  God damn Imus. 
[00:26:00]  He's been around too long to bullshit.  It's true, though, man.  Yeah.  It's exactly what it was.  More drama that ends in a, you know, this, this is a, this was a mini version of Y2K.  Yeah, this wasn't, it's not time for the whole country to completely collapse.  No.  We got a couple more, a couple more years.  Maybe a couple more decades or something.  It's all bullshit.  The whole political game is all fucking bullshit. 
[00:26:30]  Bullshit, man.  Hey, um, the Coliseum thing is today?  Yeah, big vote today.  A lot of fucking people pissed off at me because I took some shots at the Islanders in their  time of need.  And people are like, I can't fucking believe you would do this being a Long Islander and a  long time fan.  And, uh, they've been trying to educate me and they're saying that the taxes don't go  up that much, Ant.  They're saying it's like $13 a person.  I'm just bringing this to the show because I don't fucking know.  You have $400 million.  They're saying it would be 13 bucks a person. 
[00:27:00]  $400 million.  What do you know about this?  How, how many people are in Nassau County?  How many people work and pay taxes in Nassau County?  Is there a million?  How many, a million people in Nassau?  Oh yeah, there has to be.  I just don't know.  Yeah.  There has to be at least a million.  In Nassau County?  I don't know.  There has to be.  So $400 million.  Because I know in the Huntington Township in Suffolk, it's over a million.  And that's one.  Is it $14 million?  It has to be.  Okay, it's $14 million.  Sorry. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, there's, of course.  I must have been looking at the other debt.  $14 million people?  Or $14 million?  No, $14 million.  Okay, New York Islanders have guaranteed that their lease will provide $14 million at minimum.  Nassau County.  Risk $58 per household as originally reported to $13.80 annually.  Oh, so it is $13.  That's what they're saying.  I don't believe anybody, by the way.  If someone tells me it's $13, you've got to think it's going to be way more than that. 
[00:28:00]  And you know what?  I don't buy into any of that shit.  I've got to draw the line somewhere.  Enough people tell me $13.80.  How about fucking 1,000 agencies want $13.80 for me at this point in my life?  I've had it.  Yeah, that's the problem, too.  I've had it.  But, I mean, fair enough, though.  Because people hear their taxes are going to be raised.  They're thinking, oh, shit.  But they're saying it's only $13.80.  This guy's bitching at me on Twitter, this fucking guy.  You're a prick.  Why don't you fucking do this?  Why are you voting against this? 
[00:28:30]  And then his name is one thing.  And you know how you click on someone's name and you see their real name or a different  name on Twitter or whatever the fuck?  And it was something like Uniondale guy.  I'm like, oh, really?  I'm supposed to fucking believe you?  He just doesn't want the fucking people coming up north of Hempstead Turnpike and reclaiming  that area for the wild.  Because we all know what it's south of the fucking Turnpike is like.  Yeah, but if a new arena is put in, doesn't that make that whole area a little better?  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  And then I'll push it back.  So wouldn't you be for that?  It's not near me.  I could give a shit.  Oh, I see.  But this Uniondale guy is probably like, oh, we want to keep them south of the fucking  Turnpike.  I'm like, fuck it.  I once, because traffic was so bad, I was leaving an Islanders game and I took the back roads.  Holy mother of God.  Yeah.  Holy mother of Jesus Christ.  I swear, you think you're fucking in the CPT when you're driving around in a Uniondale.  But then it became fun because what I did was I started counting, and wow, is this going 
[00:29:30]  to sound racist?  And I apologize ahead of time.  Do you want me to say it?  I started counting all the chicken joints and how many different chicken joints.  You had your regulars.  You had the KFC, the Popeyes.  And then it got way off the charts, and I wish I could remember some of them at this  point.  I started laughing.  Every two traffic lights, there was another chicken joint that was different than the  ones you already saw.  Kennedy fried chicken.  I love that.  That was one of them.  Yes, KFC motherfucker. 
[00:30:00]  Kennedy fried chicken.  I definitely saw a Kennedy.  Yeah.  Lincoln fried chicken.  Well, I don't live in Nassau County, so I don't vote.  But I figured over the weekend it was fair enough to at least bring that part of the  equation to the show because I got the shit kicked out of me.  And I don't mind getting the shit kicked out of me, but at least get all the facts out  there.  So I was under the impression that taxes would be ridiculous, and a lot of people are saying  it's going to be $13.80.  So do what you want. 
[00:30:30]  I'm just pissed off at the organization in general.  I don't believe that $13.80 figure.  Sorry.  I don't fucking believe anyone at this point in my life.  I don't believe it.  And I'm sure because, you know, fuck you.  I just pulled out my fucking part of my property taxes are due on the 10th of August.  So I just pulled the thing out because they send you the thing like at the beginning of  the year.  And I was going through some papers and said, oh, fuck.  I remember this.  And I pulled it out.  And it's an unbelievable fucking amount of money. 
[00:31:00]  So fuck you.  Fuck the Islander.  I'm not, you know, nothing personal.  But fuck the Islanders.  Fuck the Coliseum.  Fuck Wang up his fucking ass.  Yeah, the guy's like a...  Pay for it yourself, you rich cock.  The guy's like a billionaire, isn't he?  Yeah.  Foot your own fucking bill.  He doesn't even know what hockey is.  He really doesn't.  Why don't I go to you and borrow some money to fucking fix up my place?  Right.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Kind of with you, even though, you know, secretly I want a new arena for the Islanders.  But it's tough to keep looking at, you know, us for the money. 
[00:31:30]  Well, you pay for it, you fuck.  And then when it starts bringing in revenue, you reap the rewards.  No, it's great, too.  It's all these hardcore hockey fans will actually...  They'll vote yes.  Yeah.  They'll get another tax bill, $1380, whatever.  I bet you it's got to be higher than that.  And then what Wang will do in appreciation is raise all the fucking ticket prices.  Is raise the prices.  That's what he'll do to his fan base, and that will be the big thank you.  We now have to raise ticket prices. 
[00:32:00]  And then I would sit there and go, what, bud?  We were there for you.  Yep.  When you needed us, we all voted yes and took a little, you know, a tiny hit.  And now you're going to fucking raise ticket prices because we did the right thing for you?  How about...  I fucking hate these guys, man.  Let me ask you, when they built the new Giants Jet Stadium in Jersey, I don't know, in Rutherford,  did that have to be voted on, too, the funds for that?  Because now they want to pay that licensing fee?  In general, they look at the taxpayers. 
[00:32:30]  I'm not sure about that situation, but in general, that's what happens.  Yeah, you're right.  They just treat you like garbage.  They look for the money from the taxpayers, and then you go, okay, and then everything  goes through the roof because it's a brand new place.  Everything.  Yeah.  Ticket prices, concessions, the parking lot, everything goes up.  Because they want to start making a profit immediately, as soon as they can, so they  raise everything.  How about this stupid Wang goes, look, you vote yes for the Coliseum, I promise I won't  raise ticket prices for, you know, the first five years. 
[00:33:00]  Do something where you're acknowledging that people are helping you out.  But that only affects the people that are going to see the hockey games.  Like, there are other things like, oh, it's going to bring revenue in, and it's going  to be great for the area and everything.  How about you fucking say, all right, when we start getting some fucking cash, not only  will we not have this tax for you anymore, the increase in taxes, but we'll give you  some money back.  Hey, look at us.  We're going to give back the money after you start making a fuck.  It's such bullshit.  Oh, we're going to take the tolls off once the road's paid for. 
[00:33:30]  Really?  Heard that one before.  Hey, once the bridge is paid for, there's no more tolls on it.  Really?  There's another MTA story today.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They lost a whole shitload of money.  Of course they did.  Mismanagement, right?  Mismanagement or something.  Quickly about the Coliseum, too, which is hilarious.  There's just so many dicks out there.  Obviously, a lot of Ranger fans live on Long Island, and they hate the fucking Islanders  and vice versa.  It's a great rivalry.  It really is.  So a lot of groups are getting together and basically saying, if you're a Rangers fan, 
[00:34:00]  vote no on the Coliseum to fuck the Islanders.  And then the other side had to go, no, you don't understand.  This is an opportunity to see Ranger games at a really nice arena, hockey arena.  Right.  You'd be able to go to a Rangers game at the new Coliseum.  Because every time the Islanders and Rangers play out there on Long Island, a whole shitload  of Ranger fans come.  Yeah.  So they're basically saying, you're fucking yourselves because you're going to have to 
[00:34:30]  watch it in a shitty arena.  Yeah.  But the Ranger fans are like, fuck that, man.  Fuck the Islanders.  Let's fuck them over.  So there's groups getting together.  And they're rallying to get as many people to vote no on the new Coliseum.  But here's what's going to happen also.  It's just like this fucking debt bullshit.  Right.  They're going to vote on this.  If it doesn't pass, they're going to get money from the private sector and build the fucking  thing anyway.  You sure?  Wang's going to have to.  Yeah.  They're not going to let the Islanders go. 
[00:35:00]  You sure?  Positive.  They will get money from the private sector and do it the way they're supposed to fucking  do it as a private venture.  Well, they can move it over the border into Queens, right?  I wouldn't mind that.  Maybe they would do that.  But I think Wang should open up his own fucking bank account.  And it's your goddamn baby.  You fucking pay for it.  I'm tired of it.  Why should people pay for it?  You shouldn't.  Well, here we go.  I vote no.  Well, Donnie's calling me an asshole.  Donnie.  Yeah.  Obi. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, sir.  You are the whiniest bitch right now.  Thank you.  Because you claim to be, you claim to be, and I understand, you claim to be all this.  You guys make a lot of money.  I work 100 hours a week behind an oven.  Here we go.  It's brutal.  You're Auschwitz, you fucking asshole.  What's your point, though?  Well, Donnie, first of all, I can't vote because I don't live in Nassau County.  Second of all, yeah, I'm kind of torn.  I'll be honest with you.  But I think sports fans around the country get fucked over.  I'm tired of people telling me how much fucking money I make and how I should give it away. 
[00:36:00]  Blow me!  Blow me!  Sure.  And you have a problem with me, Donnie.  Ant's the one that's really on his high horse about this.  Oh, you guys make all kinds of money.  I work 100 hours behind an oven.  Yeah, the world needs dick stickers, too, you know!  But Donnie, what's your point?  I know what your point is.  Yeah, Donnie, go ahead.  I don't know what his point is.  You should be supporting.  Why?  Donnie, can I ask you something?  Supporting!  Hold on, hold on.  Let's have a discussion.  Hold on, Donnie. 
[00:36:30]  Let's have a discussion.  So basically you said we should be supportive or I should be.  Fair enough.  Now, doesn't it piss you off and frustrate you when you do the right thing as a fan and  then the organization just fucks you over every chance they get?  Yeah, but I don't lose my team.  But so how is this going to change in the end?  My team.  Charles Wang doesn't own the policy and he doesn't own the property around it.  I can understand why he won't front all the money to do it.  Oh, really?  So we're supposed to, you know what?  I don't own an idiot either. 
[00:37:00]  I don't own it.  And besides, if you lose your team in this day, first of all, you're dumb if you go to  games because you're getting fucked.  You're getting fucked.  You're getting fucked.  And second of all, watch it on TV.  If they move to wherever, buy the package and watch it on television.  Yeah, it's tough to still be a fan if all of a sudden they're the Kansas City Islanders  or something, right?  But you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, it's, I, this, this is a theme on our show that comes up a lot.  We really just feel in general that, you know, sports fans just get fucked over left  and right, man.  My brother, my brother went to a Mets game recently. 
[00:37:30]  I, my brother makes no money and he's got four kids.  He got the tickets for free.  Yeah.  Nice.  You know, it happens here.  You want to go to the Mets game?  Yeah.  He fucking spent two to three hundred bucks easy.  Oh yeah.  He had the tickets for free.  And it's fair to say that three hundred dollars to my brother, you know, that's, that's a,  that's a nice hit because, you know, he had to, he had to give his family some food and  the parking and everything else.  Yeah.  And it's just ridiculous.  It wasn't like they were feasting. 
[00:38:00]  He's like, I got him a hot dog and a soda, soda each.  I don't even care the fact that it's a sports arena and it's the Islanders.  I'm not even looking at it that way.  It could be a new office building.  It could be anything over there.  I don't want to fucking pay for it.  I don't want my taxes to go up another dollar that I'm paying.  And for you to say, oh, you guys get money, you should see my fucking tax bill.  It's retarded.  Cry me a river, Anthony.  Vote yes, everybody. 
[00:38:30]  Cry me a river.  Fuck you, Donnie.  Vote no, everyone.  Anthony, your pal that talks to you every morning says that.  Not Diney.  Donnie the fruit.  Diney.  Diney.  That's right.  He's a hungry.  Look, as long as we got all the info out, that's fair.  I, you know, do what you gotta do.  I'm sick of it.  If I lived in Hadesburg County, I don't know if I would vote.  Would I vote yes?  I'm kind of torn.  God, I just know they would fuck us over in the end again, though. 
[00:39:00]  Of course.  I just know it.  Of course.  Last year, they just raised ticket prices knowing they had a relatively shitty team they were going to put on the ice.  Second half of the season, they did much better, certainly, and showed promise, but still.  You know they're going to raise prices.  And then they raised the parking lot fee, which I know is independently owned.  But if you think Wang or someone could get with the parking lot people and go knock it the fuck off, or at least if you're going to raise the parking fee, why don't you make it look like you made the parking lot a little nicer?  Something.  Look, there's no excuse that that building sat there for this long. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Like, pretty much falling apart.  It's a shithole.  So what the fuck, you know, whose fault is that, that you never modernized throughout time and slowly, you know, retrofitted some shit, improved some stuff, expanded this area?  You let it go to shit, and now you're asking for all kinds of money to make it better?  Fuck you.  I don't care.  I don't know.  I don't give a shit about fucking the Coliseum, the Islanders, or Uniondale at this point. 
[00:40:00]  It could all turn into fucking a shithole.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony, what's up?  Actually, I live in Huntington, and I'll tell you this.  Fuck the $15, because I'm tired of fucking everybody just squeezing your tits.  Close a firehouse.  There's fucking four of them in Huntington that are a mile and a half apart from one another.  But Charlie Wang wanted to...  They're volunteer fire departments.  They're volunteer fire departments out there.  Yeah, well, you go buy those fucking things.  I live in a hail site. 
[00:40:30]  They're fucking...  It's like a movie theater.  I read Monday night during football season.  They do.  Boy, let me tell you, Long Island, the volunteer fire guys, they do have some nice firehouses, man.  I might have a few members of my family that might be firefighters out there.  Oh, it's amazing.  They don't get paid.  It's great.  They have a good time, though.  The bars that they build in these fucking firehouses are stupendous.  They're social clubs.  They enjoy themselves.  Of course they do.  Gets them out of the house.  When the house goes on fire, that's who's going to put it out.  So let them have what they want.  Nothing better than when you see these lunatics with their fucking fire lights. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because they're volunteers.  They got their little blue light and they're racing to a fire.  Yeah.  Nothing scares me worse than the bald Jimmy 4x4 fucking screaming through the rain.  Anyway.  I like Tony.  Go ahead, Tony.  But Charlie Wang wanted to buy this thing and put the money up privately for this thing.  And Nassau County said, no, we can't let some guy have so much power to do this thing.  So it's not even him.  It's fucking Nassau County. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, he wanted to pay for it?  Yes.  He wanted to build it out of his own pocket.  He said, I'm a billionaire.  Here's the money.  And then, you know, and they said, no, you can't do that.  What, the officials had to get involved?  I fucking hate all of them.  People always ask, Democrat, Republican, neither.  Fuck them all.  It's not the $15.  It's the fact that the Plainview Water Department has fucking 30 cars and 22 employees.  These fucking firehouses.  It's all a circle jerk on Long Island.  And I pay $15.6 for a fucking two-bedroom ranch with no garage in taxes. 
[00:42:00]  I'm tired of it.  It is $400 million to build this coliseum.  And by the way, if they tax you on it?  $400 million.  If they make the people pay, they're going to overtax you.  There's going to be no real accounting of the money.  No.  There will be some that falls into the hands of the government that they can keep.  Maybe that's why they want it.  Because they know that they need $400 million.  But who the fuck's going to look so closely and see if they make $500 million or $450 million?  Voters would pay 4% more in property taxes, it says. 
[00:42:30]  That's kind of a thing I'm seeing real quickly there.  4% is a lot.  But let me tell you something.  Yeah, 4% is...  For one thing.  Because especially for me, I've had it.  For one thing.  I'm done being squeezed.  And if I actually get the chance to vote...  First of all, my taxes, I never get a chance to vote on them.  I never get a chance to vote on what I can or what I have to or don't have to pay in fucking taxes.  Never.  This is the first opportunity that I'm going to get to actually vote on something that will not tag another fucking thing on my taxes. 
[00:43:00]  Guys, I'm voting no.  Fuck them.  There was a guy that wanted to educate us on the whole thing and he fucking hung up.  I needed you today, brother.  Hopefully you hit a wall.  I needed you.  An abutment.  Uh...  I don't know.  Uh...  I don't know.  Uh...  $13 per person, so it's like $58 per household.  On average.  Is it?  On average.  Well, I'm not average.  So everybody that's going to only pay that much, vote yes.  Well, your house is going to be $13 and the average Spanish household will be $2,500. 
[00:43:30]  And how do they promise...  Is there a promise there?  Like, this is what we promise?  It's in writing or all of a sudden they go, well, it costs more than we expected, so now  it's $100 a household or whatever.  Exactly.  How do we know it's definitely going to be $13 a person, about $58 a household?  Cost overruns.  The fucking unions get in there and believe me, it just...  The money fucking just goes down the drain into a big hole. 
[00:44:00]  Fuck that.  Man, if I didn't have extended family, I'd find a mountaintop and just fucking rock out  the rest of my years.  Be great.  Not have to deal with anybody.  I know.  There's just assholes out there everywhere.  Like Ted Kaczynski in a shack somewhere.  Why not?  Why not?  Be great.  Why not?  You said my name wrong, Anthony!  Oh, sorry, Ted.  I wrote a man of Fusto!  A man of Fusto!  Let me say hi to Matty.  Matty!  Hello? 
[00:44:30]  What's up, Matty?  How's it going?  Hey, man.  You guys both gotta remember, though, that Nassau County Coliseum is one of their biggest  tax revenues.  You get rid of the Coliseum, you know, you get taxed to get golf, because you're going  to be making up the difference.  I'm not saying get rid of it.  I'm saying someone else pay for the fucking thing.  He's saying nerts to paying for it.  Well, I'm saying I don't want to fucking pay for it.  But it is a good point.  If they don't get a new Coliseum, this fucking team's moving.  So then what does that do to the people out there?  Well, I guess Nassau County collapses, right?  No, I don't know.  But does that mean your taxes get raised? 
[00:45:00]  But, yeah.  Who's going to make up the difference?  If you get rid of the Islanders, that is a big revenue right there.  How about the politicians realize they have plenty of fucking money and they stop mismanaging  our funds?  I agree with you on that one 100%.  It's completely insane.  Magnano's been...  This guy bought this team.  He's been losing $20 million every year.  Someone else is going to invest in a $20 million loss every year.  Yeah.  Someone else has to.  Why the fuck am I going to hate this shit? 
[00:45:30]  And I'd never see the fruits of it.  We're going to wind up investing in it anyway, though.  You know?  You might as well...  If your taxes are going to go up, you might as well have a new Coliseum, something to  show for it.  I mean...  Oh, you'd die in your own arms.  It's just a bigger issue, though.  Enough with taxing the people.  Enough.  You might as well get kissed while you're at it, you know?  Well, we don't need the rape analogy, sir.  That's not the type of humor we go for in this program.  Yes, yes.  Thank you, sir.  Wang said he'd cover any money that went over budget. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, really?  You know what?  This Wang is okay.  You're okay, Wang.  Support your life.  Mangano's been pretty cool, though, with taxes and stuff.  And he has cut a lot of shit.  So I don't think he's...  He's not the type of tax and spend politician.  Right.  Because that was the last fucking asshole that was in there that we threw out and got  Mangano in.  So I honestly think if this doesn't get paid for by the taxpayers, they will figure something 
[00:46:30]  out to pay for it privately.  Wang puts the money up.  Something.  They're not going to let the Islanders fucking leave.  I honestly believe that.  But I'm not going to sit here and be held hostage like, yeah, they're going to go.  Oh, Nassau County's all the revenue.  Oh, boy.  The taxes are all that.  Shut up.  They'll figure it out.  Not on my dime.  I paid my tax bill, too, over the weekend.  Holy shit.  It's craziness.  It's utter craziness.  I think it's the government's goal to make sure every person that is capable works until 
[00:47:00]  they're 65.  Yeah.  Because I started thinking, all right, when can I officially retire where I know I'm  good?  Yeah.  And then I paid that tax bill over the weekend.  I'm like, holy shit.  How am I going to pay that every year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You start thinking like, wait a minute.  I got to pay that every year.  Then I do the math in my head.  I'm like, wow, I'll run out of money fucking fast.  And that's the whole thing.  You could pay your mortgage.  You could own your house.  But then it's like, wait, if I don't pay my taxes, they just take my house that I paid 
[00:47:30]  for.  Who came up with that fucking law?  Who voted?  Yeah.  What public voted for that?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, exactly.  No one voted for that.  All right.  As a populace, we're going to vote for this, where even after you own your house and you  think you're clear, you're clear, you're going to have to pay taxes every year.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I got to vote yes for that.  Oh, wait, wait.  We're not done yet.  By the way, if you'd miss your taxes, even though your house is paid for, we're going to take  your house.  Where can I vote yes? 
[00:48:00]  Where?  Oh, lucky me.  This is perfect.  Where do I pull the lever?  They don't represent us.  Yeah.  That's representing the people.  Stop it.  They represent themselves.  Stop it.  They all want to be rock stars.  I told, I think, Ant before the show a few days ago, Mike, they should make a rule.  If you're a politician, you're actually not allowed to do media.  Not allowed on television.  Not allowed on TV.  Maybe you're allowed on radio, so they don't know what you look like.  Yeah.  But these assholes all want to be rock stars, and they want to be popular, and they don't  want any haters. 
[00:48:30]  They love getting in front of a podium, waving their arms and talking in a loud political  voice.  They love looking like that.  They can't wait to get on Fox News and all this.  Because it's like any other person.  You want to get to that next level.  You want to be the next fucking, you know, you want to, if you're a small man on the  totem pole there, you want to get to the next level.  Yeah.  So you're going to go on TV, make speeches.  Yeah.  Not because it's in the public's best interest, because you want a better gig.  And I would never have an approval rating. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I would say no more approval ratings.  So Obama doesn't even know if the country hates them or loves them.  And the rest of the politicians.  They have no idea, because there's no approval ratings.  And they do things just to get the approval rating up.  Of course they do.  So that's good.  No approval rating.  No approval rating.  You just got to kind of use the force.  And they're not allowed on TV.  Yeah.  They could do like old school, like, AM radio, I'll allow.  Just to get some of their info out there.  Yeah.  Can't hear them in the tunnels.  Right.  And no pictures if they do public appearances. 
[00:49:30]  No?  All cameras taken away.  I like that.  So you don't know what these assholes look like.  I think they're just working behind the scenes for you.  Yes.  Because that's how it used to be.  You never saw your politicians.  This sounds crazy, of course.  But when we started the country, you didn't really know what the guy looked like until  10 years later, when they were finally done with the sketch.  He came to your townie on a whistle stop.  Right.  Train.  You might have saw him once in your lifetime.  Maybe.  Maybe.  They were dicks back then, too.  Of course they were.  They were dicks back then.  All right.  There's a vote today. 
[00:50:00]  Our property wants to vote.  What do we say?  What say ye?  What say ye?  Say ye.  Ye.  They're dumb wigs.  Fuck them and their wigs.  There's a mentality to being that way, though.  To want to do that for a living.  To be able to have the temerity to do that.  You have to be an asshole on some level, I think.  But they want to be popular, too.  They want to be.  They want it.  Everybody wants to be a rock star.  Yeah.  You know, Facebook proves that. 
[00:50:30]  We all want to be rock stars.  Yeah.  We all want our popularity.  I am one.  I want to be a jazz star.  Ooh.  Ooh.  That should have been two boos.  A boo-boo.  Boo-boo.  A boo-boo.  A boo-boo.  All right.  I had to take the Keith's car in because my truck is getting oil change and all kinds  of shit.  Having a fist put in the driver's seat?  Yes.  Exactly.  A fist right there on the seat so I could take a seat on that.  A titanium fist because the other one kept breaking because you kept jumping up and down 
[00:51:00]  yelling, wee, hitting the gas.  Sorry.  Didn't mean to interrupt you with that.  No, it's fine.  That's exactly what's happening.  That's what they're installing.  Uh, but, uh, again, I'm driving, I, I can't really, he's got one of those pioneer XM devices  in there and I've never used it and, and I'm trying to just drive and get through fucking  traffic.  There was a car fire by Queens Boulevard, so it's just backed up, brake, gas, brake, gas,  and then, uh, I, I, the boneyard's on it and, and I couldn't turn it off. 
[00:51:30]  Now, what are you, what are you, queer?  I understand the boneyard is great, but at that hour of the morning to hear cemetery  gates, I'm like, I'm just like, you know what?  I just kind of want to listen to the news.  That was straight and a fell off.  I hit AM and it just went to static and, and I go back to, and I'm just like, and I got  to leave this on.  It's that, it's just fucking zebras.  Who's behind the door came on. 
[00:52:00]  I'm like, what?  I don't like that song, but I, you should leave the boneyard on and fucking man up when  you drive it in.  But it's too early for like, no, it's not.  What's the matter with your heels fucking falling off?  What's the problem?  Did you fucking break a nail on the car and you wanted to try to turn the boneyard off  and your brand new red fingernail falls through?  You're right, it is a little fruity of me.  Exactly.  Trying to get the Broadway channel where you is?  I was joking with someone last week about this, but now there's a, there's a stat coming 
[00:52:30]  in and maybe, maybe this is a viable thing.  I said that Apple should take over the country because they know how to run a fucking business.  Right?  And I said that to people sort of jokingly, but we all have iPhones.  I'm even giving up on everything.  I'm going iPhone in September and October.  And I wanted to be the guy that is different.  I didn't want to follow the fucking sheet, but I've run out of choices.  Yeah.  My fucking, my fucking, uh, Atrix just cannot make a goddamn phone call two blocks from 
[00:53:00]  my house.  It's unbelievable.  But anyway, uh, Seth, who's good for info in Illinois, he writes, Oh, did you see that  Apple computers?  I did not see this.  So I want hopefully, uh, some verification.  Yeah, this is true.  It is true.  Yeah.  Apple computers now has more cash than the U S government.  Yep.  How the fuck does that happen?  Because, uh, Steve jobs and management over at Apple, if they saw 10 people milling about  doing the same job, one person could do, they'd get rid of nine people. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know about that.  You go into an Apple store.  It seems like there's more employees than people, but, but, but, but they, I guess  confuses me at times.  I guess they've figured out they need that.  So why not make still making money?  If, if his stupid pancreas could hold up, why don't we make him president?  They just slid an iPhone in there.  Just cut him open, put an iPhone on his liver.  Pancreas app.  Cause what he would do.  This guy could save the fucking country.  Let's go.  No, he couldn't.  He would just keep milking us and fucking us.  Like he would like, if there was a cure for cancer, he'd help you cure cancer up to the 
[00:54:00]  waist.  And then fucking six months later, he'd get to the lungs and the brain.  That prick.  Fair enough though.  The genius is over there with the pricks, but that's all.  That's some volume on the fucking match, please.  Thank you.  But that's an unbelievable stat.  No.  Yeah.  More cash on hand, more real money.  Um, all right.  Yeah.  We should break and eat and shit.  All righty.  I had some eggs.  They were fluffy and dry and good.  I need some eggs.  I see the piece of it on your lip.  Oh, that's not egg. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, it is not?  I hate greasy egg whites.  You have egg on your face.  Oh, what did I say that wasn't true?  You hear that?  Yeah.  What's wrong with the mic today?  You hear that?  It's like a little staticky thing.  Yeah.  I noticed that before.  Mars.  Something's wrong with the mic.  Want to take a break?  Yeah.  Let's see.  And we'll talk about the fight when we come back.  Ah.  Fade door. 
[00:55:00]  Thank God I didn't fly to Chicago.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that.  Also, I want to say that CokeLogic.  Oh, man.  He's a bum, but he's good.  He animated.  Oh, God.  I did make a request a few weeks ago.  Oh, no.  I haven't seen this yet.  And CokeLogic animated Blueberries, the standalone fruit.  This is going to cause major problems between the two shows.  Oh, no.  But I couldn't help myself.  There's a great animation of Fez doing Blueberries, the standalone fruit on my YouTube. 
[00:55:30]  That's a fucking great Fez animation.  He's great, man.  He is so fucking good.  I'll tweet the fucking link, but CokeLogic did me a favor.  Blueberries, the standalone fruit, is now featured on my stupid YouTube channel.  Oh, Sam is in there.  Sam makes a cameo.  This is great.  The animation of Fez is spot on, man.  Holy shit.  I like the slow push in on him, too.  The dramatic slow push in is great. 
[00:56:00]  He does such good fucking work.  But it's officially up and running, so check it out.  It's great.  He's a good graphics guy.  Yeah.  And to Fez, I mean, come on.  We're all on the same page.  A little less.  This is one of the greatest moments in radio, unfortunately at his expense, but it's just  an amazing moment.  We all have shitty moments on the radio.  Yeah.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[00:56:30]  Stand-alone fruit.  Yeah.  That is spot on, man.  It's amazing.  It really is.  He's a miracle worker.  So check that out.  Also, Jimmy's Rashad Evans choke out is up on the channel, too.  That's great.  The noises you make, dude. 
[00:57:00]  Dude, your fucking head is being mushed my head like a tomato.  Where does it hurt?  In the neck?  It's not even necessarily a hurt.  It's just everything you know in the world.  Keep blinking, stupid.  You heard the sound he made.  It feels like that sound. 
[00:57:30]  That's up there, too.  Doing real well, so.  And then Rashad did the...  Oh, yeah.  Did the gym in prison move.  This one comes here.  Yeah, he's got everything all tied up.  A little tighter, Rashad.  A little tighter, Rashad.  Oh, pause this.  Pause this.  Pause this.  This is why you got to check out the video.  Mars, you're embarrassing.  You're telling a UFC killer, a tighter, tighter, Rashad, like he wasn't doing it right.  Back it up.  Oh, shit.  That's Mars in the background.  He's getting all excited again. 
[00:58:00]  What's my hat for?  Rashad.  Go back further.  All right, right there.  Listen to Mars in the background.  This one comes here.  Yeah, he's got everything all tied up.  A little tighter, Rashad.  A little tighter, Rashad.  I just push my head.  Holy shit.  Why are you telling Rashad Evans that he's not doing it properly, Mars?  Airspace right there.  You think Rashad Evans knows that there's airspace?  Of course he knows.  Between the shin and the back of his knee, so he needed to make that a little tighter. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, so you're saying that Rashad wasn't, he might not have known how to do it to the radio host.  I was watching, it's funny, I know how that felt to have done, and I watched last night  again the Anderson Silva-Chael Sonnen fight where Chael beat the shit out of him for fighting.  He beat him up.  And then Anderson Silva won in the last minute and 30, I think with an amazing triangle.  And I'm just, I watched that, and I thought like he fucking locked him up in a triangle,  and squeeze, and he was also doing that thing where he pulls down, like he said, I'd normally 
[00:59:00]  pull down the head as hard as he could, and he just got on the tap.  But even Chael Sonnen was trying to get out of it, like he, he, like how do you try to  get out of that and not tap immediately?  There's a move to make, you pull your leg over, Rogan described like what he did, which  was the right thing, but he just couldn't get out of it.  But he really fought getting out of that fucking, and I'm like, how do you make any movement  while a guy is squeezing you as hard as he can?  Unbelievable.  I don't know how they do it.  Yeah, they're really, the guys are amazing. 
[00:59:30]  Thank God Mars was there to tell Rashad Evans how to do it properly.  Yeah, yeah.  That's cool.  Tighter, Rashad, because he's never done this before in competition.  Later, Rashad.  A guy whose ponch is growing by the day, by the way.  Oh, Jesus.  Exactly.  He was talking about his pants and shirt.  Tighter, Rashad.  Actually getting tighter.  But thank God you were there to make sure it was done properly.  Rashad later adjusted the processing on all the microphones.  Right.  Yes.  Fantastic.  Just to show you how it is.  They brought in a cake with a picturesque scene on it. 
[01:00:00]  His wife makes nice cakes.  They are good cakes.  Really nice cakes, Mars.  That's why I said a picturesque scene.  Picturesque.  She does a terrific job with those cakes, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's eat.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  Fuck you.  I want to give a big fuck you to Anthony every time he does that.  Shit, I get that crap stuck in my head for days, asshole. 
[01:00:30]  Fuck you.  Hey, this message goes out to the U.S. government.  I'm an army officer.  I created an app.  It says $36,000 fucking dollars to protect the troops.  And when asked for help and funding, the government says there is no funds available.  And God knows there are fucking defense budgets.  $700 billion a year.  So I've done three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I just want to say thank you, government. 
[01:01:00]  Thanks for your help and supporting myself and my fellow comrades.  So fuck you.  Fuck you.  This fuck you is Eric Nagel.  Man, after a performance at the ONA Hard Rock Cafe, you fucking rock.  So fuck you.  Fuck you.  I want to send a big fuck you to work in the night shift.  I'm all by myself and no one's up.  And I have no one to talk to.  And I got to make fucking stock puppets.  And they talk to me. 
[01:01:30]  That's cool.  And I end up jerking off in the bathroom.  That's no fucking fun.  Fuck you, night shift.  Fuck you.  This FU goes out to my stupid boss with her dopey centurion helmet looking hairdo.  And her raspy smoker's voice always yelling at me.  Do you think it's easy to work outside in 110 degrees?  Please, don't tell me that you're the one sweating when I'm the one doing all the fucking work.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I want to say fuck you, Jesus, for raping me and my butt.  Fuck you. 
[01:02:00]  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like, through, you know, the air satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really... 
[01:02:30]  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  Oh.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but, like, I mean, did you get into your router settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here.  Yeah, exactly right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that? 
[01:03:00]  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean, like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet?  Yeah, they call them...  I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just...  Let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay? 
[01:03:30]  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that...  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  Do you want some other tech questions I needed?  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No, if you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine.  I'm up to my limit of friends, 5,000. 
[01:04:00]  I'm not helping you.  I think somebody sent us a fan page.  I'm hanging up.  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  This is the virus, Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, we got Danny McBride coming in tomorrow. 
[01:04:30]  Love Danny McBride.  And I think we got some Eastbound and Down DVDs to give away this week.  We should get him to sign them first and give them away signed.  Why would we do that?  That's a much better idea.  Oh, can we do that, Travis?  We can have him sign them?  Yeah, all right.  So we won't start the giveaway until after tomorrow's appearance. 
[01:05:00]  I was going to give one away now, but, yeah, that's a great idea.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, we can give it away and he'll fucking sign it.  He'll sign it.  Oh, my God.  How stupid am I?  Don't answer that.  Thank you.  When Kenny Powers comes back, he comes back hard on the hilarious and profane.  Profound?  Profane.  Profane?  Profane's right, yeah.  P-R-O-F-A-N-E.  What's the difference between profane and profound?  And profound?  Profound is profound.  Profound is what I think I am.  And what's profane?  Profound is what I think I am.  Profane is what I really am. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, profound is deep.  Like, what a profound thought.  I almost said propane.  Could be propane, too.  All right, so let's do that.  Own the hilarious and propane HBO series, Eastbound and Down.  The complete second season in DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download today.  And experience Kenny Powers deep inside Mexico.  Must be at least 18 years old.  And a listener or subscriber, not open to residents of Alaska, Hawaii, or Canada.  So we'll give one away right now to a random caller.  There you go.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  Nice.  Right?  Cancer-stricken WTC worker.  Cancer.  Gets zero in a settlement check.  I'm a busy guy.  Well, the money went to good places, though.  Cancer-stricken ground zero worker, Edgar Galvis.  I just hate everybody.  People just suck.  No one can do the right thing ever.  Cancer-stricken ground zero worker, Edgar Galvis, has finally received the compensation check.  Very good news.  He's been fighting for this for a long time.  Very good.  The check was for zero dollars.  They actually mailed a check that had a zero dollar amount on it. 
[01:06:30]  For zero dollars?  Yep.  What cunts.  That's the humanity we deal with each other with.  The 51-year-old Queens man who suffered sinus problems and then throat cancer after months  of removing toxic debris from the World Financial Center was relieved to get a check in the  mail for his court settlement with Merrill Lynch, whose offices he had cleaned.  But he was stunned when he saw the amount was zero point zero zero dollars.  Zero point zero.  Some asshole had to put that in a fucking envelope for this guy. 
[01:07:00]  But his award was only ten thousand and five dollars?  Yeah, his award was ten thousand and five dollars, but his lawyers at the firm Werby Groner Edelman  and Napoleon Bern lopped off two thousand and five hundred and seventy nine dollars for  unitemized legal expenses.  Then they took a thirty three point three percent fee of twenty one twenty four.  So this fucking law firm took off forty seven hundred dollars.  Almost half his money went to them.  Yes, they also subtracted three hundred fifty two dollars a fee to the lawyer who referred 
[01:07:30]  him a referral to the lawyer.  And that right there, we've dealt with lawyers for many years now.  That referral thing, that's like, you know, a courtesy thing.  You could you could like say, no, I don't need my fee for grounds that they're all decided  they needed their fee.  The remaining four thousand nine hundred fifty dollars was withheld for unspecified liens.  The letter says Galvis thinks this was repayment of workers compensation for aid.  I've hit rock bottom, said Galvis, who's jobless and thirty thousand dollars in debt. 
[01:08:00]  There you go.  You got a check for zero point zero zero.  If that ever happens to me, I will fucking march down to the office and punch someone in  the face.  Well, you'd have to.  Of course.  It's just everything's fucked.  I got an insurance, my insurance premiums, you know, for one of the policies.  I send the money in every month.  You know, I pay my bills.  And apparently I paid them a little too much. 
[01:08:30]  So they instead of just on the next bill crediting me.  Right.  They sent me a check for one dollar and eight cents.  And I'm looking going, how much did it cost the company to get that check to me instead  of just creditating the next fucking bill?  Like they had to literally send a paper check out to me for one dollar and eight cents.  That's what's fucked about insurance companies and really any company. 
[01:09:00]  Well, yeah, because it's just one check to you.  But I'm sure.  Yeah.  There's thousands and thousands of those checks being made every day.  Really?  Do you have to do that?  Or can you just credit my fucking, the next premium for the next one?  You would think that's one quick way to save a few bucks if you're a company.  Yeah.  Because, you know, they don't, they pass the savings on to us, don't they?  Pass the savings on to you.  Hey, I got to acknowledge Dan G in Connecticut.  Profound and profane.  Is Opie really the only college graduate in the studio?  Oh, Jesus.  Me and Sam Roberts are the only ones that are in the studio anyway. 
[01:09:30]  And I swear to you, I've never heard the word profane until today.  Really?  I don't think so.  You've been profane for years.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I think that's good.  I don't think I've ever heard that word before.  You would be classified as being profane.  Profound is not a word.  Profound is.  Profound is not.  Wait, did you just insult me?  Well, no, because you are profane.  You are profane.  What's profane?  It's obscene.  It's offensive.  Unworthy.  Vulgar.  Oh, I thought that was profound. 
[01:10:00]  No, that's profound.  Obscene.  Obscene.  Yeah.  I would use obscene before profane.  Yeah.  Profane is like obscene.  It's the same ilk.  Fuck, I'm going to do that.  I'm much better in the crossword puzzle world.  To treat something sacred with abuse, irreverence, or contempt.  I'm sorry.  Did you think profane was a fane that used to be amateur?  I stepped on your definition for that shit joke.  Oh, God.  Profane.  That joke was profane, and the idea that it was disguised as a joke. 
[01:10:30]  So, will I appear smarter if I use that word now?  Because I would just say obscene.  It's profane.  It's all context.  Yeah.  Fuck, I'm going with profane.  Yeah.  I'm profane.  Yo, profane!  Motherfucking profane!  Man, where's profane at?  All right.  Fair enough, sir.  I didn't pay attention in college.  I realized that after two years, I could cheat my way through.  That works.  And I did.  Cheated my way through college, but focused on the radio.  Radio.  Because I realized the classroom, for me, I'm only speaking for myself, was a complete 
[01:11:00]  waste of time.  A waste of time.  So, we got a master key and found all the tests in the garbage.  A la Animal House.  Yeah, that's true.  Whatever gets you through.  That's what I say.  That's a true story.  I'll say.  But I didn't cheat when I was doing my college radio show.  I focused all my attention on that.  So, I was like, why would I fucking study Russian history when I could, like, maybe figure  out what this radio thing's about a little more? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, the czars were pretty interesting.  The czars.  The czars.  But I had Coach write a fucking paper for me.  Motherfucker.  He was the guy.  Ah, we've talked about it.  Go-to guy, yeah.  He's dead now.  It sucks.  He used to go to the Idol Hour.  I'll say it real quick for the new listeners.  Geneseo.  This guy would sit in the back kind of corner with a pitcher of beer, just chilling.  Any night of the week, he'd pretty much be found at the Idol Hour.  And you would go up to him like he's a mafia boss.  And he goes, what do you need? 
[01:12:00]  I'm like, Russian history.  He goes, what grade do you want?  I go, oh, man.  I don't need no A.  I'll take a solid B.  Yeah, you want to.  You don't want to.  But an A costs more.  But a C costs a lot less.  So it was like you had to juggle your beer money.  Like, fuck.  That's pretty good.  What are you talking about?  I think my parents would be proud if I got a B in Russian history.  I'll go B, sir.  What would that go for?  I don't remember anymore.  Maybe some guys from back then could call up.  I mean, would it be tens of dollars or hundreds?  Oh, it was definitely.  My memory, if it serves me right, I would say $200 for a B. 
[01:12:30]  Okay.  About there.  Which is a lot of money for a college kid.  Yeah, yeah.  Plus, this is, you know, in the mid-90s.  So, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Mid-90s.  So, you were going to school when we were on.  Shut up.  At AAF?  Turn it off.  And then the guy goes, come back Tuesday or whatever, next week, and I'll have your paper.  I'm like, fucking beautiful.  This was before the internet where now they got all sorts of programs where you hand in  a paper.  Now they fucking check to see if you got it from somewhere else. 
[01:13:00]  Plagiarism programs.  And this is the twist in the story.  I get a call from someone that was in the know and goes, oh, boy, he's in the fucking  hospital.  He had a heart attack or something.  Oh, boy.  So, I was panicking that he wasn't going to be able to write my paper.  I didn't care about his health.  I just wanted to make sure.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was going to be out of the hospital in time to write my paper.  But then it turns out he didn't even really write the papers.  He had a whole fucking filing system.  He'd just pull it out, change a few things.  He'd rotate them around over the years.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Bring out a new box full of fucking tests from another year. 
[01:13:30]  Darren, this guy had a major business going, man.  Wow, that's something.  I'm sure the internet shut him down, obviously, because he was still around when the internet  started hitting.  I think it was a couple hundred bucks per paper.  And, I mean, he was doing...  He was a coach.  I would imagine he was doing a few a week around midterm time.  Yeah.  He wasn't a coach.  They just called him coach.  I don't even know why they called him coach.  We detect plagiarism on another level.  Plagiarismdetect.com.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Now you can't do any of this shit. 
[01:14:00]  You know, you hand in a paper at a college, they're checking this.  They're cross-checking this all over the place.  What's Mencia's picture doing on that?  Come on.  Come on.  Hey, Louis C.K. is doing a Dane Cook thing with the next Louis.  And you're in the episode.  Yes.  What's the episode about?  I don't know.  I didn't read the script.  I literally don't know.  That's what my girl said.  What?  I saw Dane there, so that's why I noticed.  She goes, I bet you Jimmy didn't even read the script, so I bet you if you ask him, 
[01:14:30]  he's going to not know what the episode's about.  No idea.  But I did see Dane there, and we said hello.  Well, the coming attraction shows, like, them sort of making fun of Dane Cook, and then  all of a sudden, Louis, like, you know, is allowed into, you know, Dane Cook's world.  He has to get through the big fucking bouncer mafia type dude, and then sits down with Dane  Cook.  And then Dane gives a look like, all right, let's go.  And that's all they show.  Hmm.  I'll have to see that one.  I got to catch up on my, uh...  Louis C.K.?  Louis C.K., yeah.  Did you see the last episode?  Where it opens up and there's no dialogue for the first, like, five minutes? 
[01:15:00]  No, I haven't seen that one yet.  Fucking brilliant.  Yeah, I heard that was great.  The shot on the violin player.  They just did talk about it in the Daily News today.  Brilliant.  I tweeted, it shows New York perfectly.  Yeah.  Where you could see beauty and just a horrific sight all at the same time.  I got to see that shit.  Homeless guy basically showering on a subway platform with bottles of water, just getting  a nice washing in.  Getting a wash.  And he's washing out his asshole, basically.  Oh, God.  As a beautiful violinist, beautiful meaning his music is just fucking playing perfectly 
[01:15:30]  as Louis is waiting for the subway.  And I'm like, that is New York right there.  Yeah.  It absolutely is New York right there.  Yeah, he's a smart guy.  They're starting to call him kind of like Woody Allen as far as how he depicts  New York.  That's what the article said, right?  Wow.  I didn't read Woody Allen, but it might be a different article.  Yeah, it might have been.  Or I just made it up.  Or I dreamt it.  I don't know.  Maybe you dreamt that Obama said that to you.  Obama.  And then you said something and he took away his invitation. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  I can't breathe when I lay down, when I sleep.  Like, I keep having shortness of breath.  Do you fix it out of the pillow?  Is that what you're doing?  I sleep like an infant with my arms split out.  Your ass in the air?  Yeah.  I got 43 and I'm dying of SIDS.  Have you had your throat looked at?  I need to have my lungs checked.  It's about taking deep breaths.  But it might be panic because when I'm totally relaxed, I have no problem.  But there's a tightening in my chest, right?  Like, I've talked for years about not being able to take that full breath.  It's not my heart.  I check my heart. 
[01:16:30]  But I think it's in my head now.  That's anxiety.  Maybe, yeah.  I don't know if I'm partly asthmatic.  Can you partially?  Because I lived with mold in my old place.  You're partially, yeah.  Mold.  No, I'm not.  Oh, yeah, you are.  Partially?  Partially?  Partially?  No.  Partially?  No, I'd say good half-ly.  Good half-ly.  That black mold will get you every time.  I know.  I know.  Yeah, it figures.  How's Wilford doing?  Jeez, man.  You just made me take a real deep breath.  Yeah, because it feels good.  It felt good right there.  Should I stop?  Fuck Wilford.  It's one fucking joke. 
[01:17:00]  That was an hour show.  What are they doing?  Is it good?  I don't know.  I watched one.  I watched the first three.  I thought they were okay.  It was better than I thought they were.  Well, he's not around.  We don't need to fucking kiss his ass anymore.  Fuck Wilford and that stupid dog.  You know, the fact that the fucking lawyers are taking 33, and I know that's standard.  We're an embarrassing country.  That is.  Like, these are guys that fucking went in and picked bodies out of the rubble.  But lawyers have a whole courtesy thing, and these guys are worse than regular lawyers  because they certainly should have done the right thing and knocked down their fees 
[01:17:30]  and all.  But there's not one ounce of fucking...  The fact that 10 years is going by, like, the building is going up finally, but it's  like, we're an embarrassing, litigious country.  And no shock to me that the rest of the world hates our fucking guts.  All we do is tell everybody else how they should live.  We stick our fucking red, white, and blue fucking nose in everybody else's business, and  then we can't even take care of our own ground zero workers without fucking litigating and  tying up the courts.  Americans, the whole fucking group of us are just embarrassing. 
[01:18:00]  I like to see it.  I like to be alive for when it collapses and then sees, you know, get to see what happens.  Let's see when everybody finally goes like, oh, boy, we sure had it good, I think.  What happened?  What happened to Tom Brokaw?  He looks like grandpa now.  He's aged drastically in the last year or two.  Holy shit.  Well, he must have really...  He's on Morning Joe right now.  Gussied him up for the news.  Well, how long has he been off?  Was that 10 years already?  Maybe not.  I just said 10.  Maybe he was coloring his hair and all that. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, maybe.  He looks healthy.  He just looks a lot older.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's no kid, that guy.  He was here recently.  Oh, I forgot about what you wanted to talk about after the break, Jimmy, but Marco did not  forget.  Marco in Chicago.  What's up, sir?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Did you watch Strikeforce this weekend?  Can I hold it for one more second?  I'm sorry, sir.  Because Ann was talking about the $1.80 thing, and you were wondering how much that costs  the company?  Yeah.  This guy's in the know.  Bob in Iowa, really fast. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Ann.  To cut that check for you cost...  I work for a major insurance company in Des Moines, Iowa, and to cut that check cost  the company $40.  How come that much?  I believe this guy.  I completely believe this guy.  It's all computerized.  Crazy.  I believe this guy.  This is what's the...  Sorry, boys.  Why $40?  Well, it has to...  There's various processing systems, and depending on the policy and things like that, it has  to go through various authorizations to have checks cut and so on. 
[01:19:30]  So if it's a minimum amount, such as below $5, a lot of companies won't cut those checks.  But if it's anything above the $5, the check has to be cut, and it's very manual.  I believe this guy.  This looked very computerized.  My check.  I bet you that they just go over the books, they see what they owe, they just cut the  check, and that's it.  I was saying it just would have been easier, regardless of what the cost is.  It would have been easier for them to just credit my account.  Maybe they're not allowed to do that.  Maybe they're not allowed to take your $1.80 and do what they think you should do with it. 
[01:20:00]  Maybe they legally have to give it back to you.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's change the law.  Then they should change that.  Because in the end, it's costing us.  Well, if you want to leave that insurance company, they've taken your $1.80, which could  be $1,000 or $2,000, and put it into another round of coverage.  Sons of bitches.  By the way, also, the Ground Zero thing, their whole fight is, well, there's no proof that  that caused cancer.  And it just reeks of the cigarette companies that, for years, did the same thing. 
[01:20:30]  It does.  And it's like, stop it.  They were down there.  Who's saying that?  The insurance companies?  Yeah.  Of course.  Breathing in asbestos and fucking granule cement.  Yeah.  What do you think it causes?  Yeah.  You think that in your sinuses and nose and throat and lungs isn't going to fuck you up?  Just please stop.  The insurance companies, now, I would never, ever encourage people to do violence against  other people.  But it just, as a theory, to me, there's no more murderable group of human beings than 
[01:21:00]  the insurance industry.  They're just fucking despicable people.  And I know that there's insurance cheats, and you guys have to fight that, and you  have to make sure that you're not, because people run onto a bus and claim they were hurt.  And I know that insurance companies are also ripe to be fucked, so they have to be very  cautious.  But there comes a part where you're not being cautious, you're being disgusting.  They have such a gimmick going, too.  It's like, yeah, pay us your money.  Keep paying.  Don't you fucking let that lapse.  Keep paying.  And then the second something happens, and you want their services that you have paid 
[01:21:30]  for, it's like pulling fucking teeth.  They will do everything in their power to not give you the services that you have paid  every month for, and they just won't give it to you.  They're just terrible.  Despicable.  Cacksuckers.  Cacksuckers.  Fuck you.  Fuck your money.  Let's go back to Marco in Chicago.  Marco.  Marco.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Sorry about that, by the way.  No, no problem, bro.  Listen, that fight, Strikeforce. 
[01:22:00]  Yes, I did.  I went to Anthony's, actually.  Yes, we watched together on each other's laps.  Kicked all the girls out and just sat there, me and him, in the dark.  Some men touching.  Now, what did you think of that fight, man, against Fedor and Hendo?  Man, I personally thought they should have let that fight go on just a little bit longer.  That's my opinion, too.  I felt that way.  My first fight, my first thought, dude, was that he was out because his arms, Fedor's  arms went limp.  Right.  He stumbled for a second, but then you can see that he, like, turned around, and he was 
[01:22:30]  getting up already, and then, you know, and then Dean Herber, he called it right away.  Herb Dean.  No, no, sir.  He wasn't getting up.  What happened was he had knocked Dan Henderson down, and Henderson, very tough guy.  That was an uppercut.  Yeah, he got behind him and kind of, like, you know.  That was awesome.  Man, holy cow.  Uppercut him.  He got good on that uppercut.  But when he uppercutted him, he fell on his face with his hands splayed out at his  sides.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he got hit in the head a couple of times, so Herb Dean was already running over there 
[01:23:00]  to stop the fight.  Like, we're watching it right now.  Fedor's wailing on him.  Right.  But now he goes, and here's the uppercut.  Boom.  Look, arms out, out.  He got two good shots to the head.  And as he got punched in the head twice, the referee ran in to stop it, because the  referee's not thinking, gee, he might wake up and turn over.  He sees a guy on his face with his arms splayed out getting hit in the head.  I don't know.  And even if he had turned over, Henderson would have finished him, right?  There's no way you get knocked out like... 
[01:23:30]  Maybe he would have, but you know...  He would have, dude.  I like Fedor, too.  Oh, Jesus.  They would have found out.  No, dude, but that couple more seconds could have given him brain damage.  Let me ask...  No, you're right, you're right, but tell me that looks like a great fight.  Let me ask this.  I didn't see the fight.  Was Fedor pissed off that they stopped the fight?  No, he's never pissed off.  He...  When he talked at the end...  Well, he threw it in...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my fucking Lord.  When at the end of the fight, when they went through an interpreter, he said, you know... 
[01:24:00]  Of course not.  He alluded to the fact that...  That he could have kept fighting.  He could have kept fighting.  But he has to say that when you see him turned over, he might have been turned over just putting  his arms up, but when you get fucking wailed on the head twice with your arms splayed out  at your sides like that...  Yeah, but...  He looked out for a half...  Or completely unable to defend himself.  The referee ran right in.  He looks a little dazed as they're doing the aftermath here.  The referee's not going to run in and stop fucking Fedor just from getting punched. 
[01:24:30]  You know what, though?  I don't think that's what MMA...  That's a boxing thing.  I don't think it's an MMA thing.  I think...  Not let the guy pound him in the face while you sit there fucking filing your nails as  a ref.  But, I mean, just give him a little more time.  Well, the difference between this and boxing is...  In boxing, you never get hit after you're out.  Here you can.  And his arms...  Dude, he wasn't even covered.  He got hit in the head a couple times with his arms remained at his side.  He didn't pull...  It was a great fight, though.  It wasn't a great fight. 
[01:25:00]  I mean, it was a great fight for Henderson.  I would have liked to have seen it.  Fedor looked terrible.  And...  Fedor's belly was hanging over his pants.  He weighed 223.  He outweighed Henderson by 16 pounds.  And also, Henderson...  This is not an age thing.  Henderson's fucking 40.  Fedor's 34.  And Henderson went up in weight.  Like, Fedor's used to fighting guys that should...  Fedor's gut.  Yeah.  Dan Henderson is the new Randy Couture, man.  That dude...  He really is an animal.  And he's ever been knocked out.  Yeah.  The fact that he was able to turn him over... 
[01:25:30]  Great fight, bro.  Great fight.  But it wasn't a great fight.  It was a great one-round.  Boom, boom.  I don't know if you can call it a great fight.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It was exciting.  How could you not say that, man?  It was exciting, but I mean, it was just a quick one-round fight.  I mean, it was a nice one-rounder.  But that's all right.  That first second...  I'm just pulling my headphones off.  I can't even deal with this.  I liked the chick fight, to tell you the truth.  I apologize to Jimmy.  I did this on purpose.  I did.  I know.  I liked the chick fight, too.  The chick fight was fucking good, because the one that won, she had a nice ass on her. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And she was doing a lot of things where she was showing a pussy.  A meaty pussy.  Yeah.  She had a meaty one, too, Jimmy.  Forget her name.  She was second.  Is Couture's old lady, ex-old lady still fighting?  I don't know, actually.  She was one of those bruds.  I don't think that's it.  I don't know.  Marco, do you know?  No.  I don't know, actually.  All right.  Take care.  Thanks, brother.  Yeah.  Bye, bro.  Be good, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, she choked the other bitch out. 
[01:26:30]  It was pretty cool.  Yeah, new champion.  Yeah, yeah, and it was for some bitch belt.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  But Fedor is finished, I think.  He would have got killed at UFC.  I mean, I liked the guy a lot, but I think that he wasn't as good as everyone, myself certainly  included, thought he was, because there's no excuse to lose a Dan Henderson fight when  you had the advantage of you're six years younger, you're heavier, you're used to fucking  fighting much heavier guys.  Is this hot?  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  I mean, because when chicks are like cat fighting, that's really fucking hot.  But when they're doing MMA, is it hot?  Yeah.  Chick boxing is not hot.  Not at all.  This is hot, because that girl's got a fucking smoking ass on her.  Yeah, they've got great bodies.  The one on the pink has like...  They're cut, nice.  The other one is just pure man.  The one on the pink has a fat puss.  Yeah, and she was like, look at that, come on, she's wrapping her legs around her waist  and...  Yeah, I didn't get to see this over the weekend.  She looks like fucking Uriah Faber in the face. 
[01:27:30]  I was going to say that, you're right.  She does.  She's probably just as big as him.  Yeah, she's fucking...  They're bantam weight, I don't know what that weight is.  Oh, look at the ass.  It's like a lighter, lighter weight.  Yeah, she got off smoking ass.  Somebody sent me a few pictures of her, like posing in a bikini and shit like that.  Nice shitter.  Gotta give her a shitter.  Someone's mad at you.  Oh, Tom.  Hi, Tom.  Tom, what's the problem, Tom?  Why?  First of all, why are you mad, Tom? 
[01:28:00]  That's so fucking irritating.  Why?  When someone starts to talk over you, and you fuckers talk over every fucking body, especially  It's our show.  We all talk over each other.  It's our show.  And we listen.  That's what we do.  And I listen to people.  It's our show, right, Jimmy?  It's our show.  That's what I do.  I listen to people.  I talk over everybody.  It's a very fucking show, but don't fucking...  You could want to listen to people, but you also got to let people talk, right?  Tom.  That's what I'm saying, Opie.  Tom.  I think the reason that...  Tom. 
[01:28:30]  First of all, we all interrupt each other.  Second of all, Tom, that was very obvious that Marco kind of didn't really know how to handle  a conversation with a human being.  Well.  You hung up on me?  Oh.  You hung up on me?  No.  No, we're actually...  We actually let you talk.  Don't.  We all shut up so we could talk, and he goes, you hung up on me.  You're panicking, Tom.  Oh, God, Tom.  You're out, Tom.  All right, Tom.  It's too late now.  Tom, it was... 
[01:29:00]  You lost us.  Especially Jimmy.  I don't...  Tom, I don't...  I don't care.  I'll tell you why I got irritated.  Because I was going back and forth with the guy.  Like, I just listened to what you said.  And now I'm talking to you.  And if you interrupted right now, that would be what he did.  Over and over again.  I was listening, and then talking, and then listening and talking, but...  And he was a nice guy, but he just kept going.  Like, I would say, like...  And this is right where he would go, yeah, yeah.  It's like, dude, just...  We'll get back to you.  Yeah, but that's just the way you guys do it every time. 
[01:29:30]  But then when you get pissed off, and you get your little pouty bullshit going on, like,  what the fuck is wrong with you guys?  Again, you must be a married guy.  Maybe you're used to being interrupted constantly.  I wouldn't marry one of these bitches for nothing.  But again, you and I just had a conversation.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't particularly like you, but we had a conversation.  So how did you know how to not interrupt, and he didn't?  Because I'm listening to you.  I listen to you every morning, dude.  I listen to you every fucking time when you get pissed off.  Because the man wants to carry a conversation. 
[01:30:00]  I love the show.  I'm not shooting.  But it fucking hurts.  It pulls my balls back, dude.  Well, then you go through life constantly being interrupted and never get annoyed at it.  We all do it, but it was constant.  Well, sure.  But I don't know.  I said, well, why'd you get upset?  Why'd you get upset?  Oh, my God.  It was obvious.  I didn't get that upset.  I didn't yell and scream.  It was just mildly annoying.  And you proved Jimmy's point by saying you haven't interrupted because you know how to listen.  Yeah.  The other guy, apparently then, from what you just said, did not.  He might have been just a little excited to be on the show. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Which is fine.  He was a nice guy.  He seemed like a nice guy.  He just wanted to have his voice.  All right, Tom.  Yeah.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Speaking of L.A., I guess he was calling from L.A.  We'll do a little seg.  We'll hear about the...  Was it a reporter?  Shot?  Shot as he's doing a live...  What was that?  Was it a BB gun?  I didn't hear it, but I'm happy.  A BB gun.  BB gun.  Stop.  That's kind of funny.  We used to shoot each other with BB guns first.  Is that funny?  That's funny, right?  Yeah, that's funny.  Yeah.  When I first heard the story, I thought it was a shot shot. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Like a real gun.  BB gun.  We've all taken a BB or two.  Yeah, everyone's shot someone with a BB gun.  In our ute.  And so it was very loud, and the thunder, and it just came down with a rush.  It was wonderful.  First of all, is this a guy or a girl?  Does anyone know?  I think it's a broad.  A girl is the one who got shot, but that's a pre-taped piece.  And so while the pre-taped piece is playing, she got shot.  And then when they come back to her live, you can hear her saying, look at the blood,  before she goes into her.  Oh.  Continues on with the story. 
[01:31:30]  I thought she got shot live.  Does she say, I just got shot with a BB or no?  No, no, no.  No, why would she?  Why would they just do honest reporting and real life stuff and say that?  Yeah.  Let's trust her.  I hate them.  I hate this story already.  And so it was very loud, and the thunder, and it just came down with a rush.  It was wonderful.  It was nice.  And look at the blood.  And certainly a lot of rain overnight up in Highland.  That was one area.  There you go.  Wait a minute.  That's why they're so hateable. 
[01:32:00]  She continued?  Yeah.  She didn't even say, I got shot with a BB.  Why can't they fucking have a real moment?  Never.  Because they're terrible boars.  That's why.  Like, holy shit, I got shot.  I'm okay.  Here's the blood.  Wow.  Like, someone just shot me with a BB.  I'm in the weather, as Mother Nature still keeps things unsteady out here in the Inland  Empire.  And of course, with that came all of the thunder now to the sky.  And then, of course, taking a hit earlier.  Certainly a lot of rain.  They're full.  It was nice.  And look at the blood.  And certainly a lot of rain overnight up in Highland. 
[01:32:30]  That was one area of really taking a hit earlier.  And she won't say it.  That's why, by the way, when they try to improv, they're terrible.  And then, of course, we had the lots of lightning that lit up the night sky.  She's off.  And of course, with that came all of the thunder.  Now, Gene Blevins of the L.A. Daily News.  Why does she feel like she has to continue?  She was shot by something.  Everything is.  She probably thought a rock hit her.  We certainly have seen those clouds building up in the mountains.  Certainly a concern for the rest of the day.  Keeping a very close eye on the weather.  Keep close eye on the weather. 
[01:33:00]  Still keeps things unsteady out here in the Inland Empire.  You fucking robot.  Shut up.  Is that what she got into broadcasting for, Leanne, to be a fucking long-necked robot?  An unmemorable long-necked robot?  She is basically saying that her weather report is way more important than the fact that she just got shot by something.  And it's the news.  Fucking idiots.  There was another story that made me react the same way.  I was watching a video of it.  It's a gentleman in front of a guy's house. 
[01:33:30]  He's a hoarder, apparently.  And the door is open.  And it was before they were going, right before they were going on.  They were just going live.  And the guy's going, and this gentleman lives in this house.  And the guy's there going, go away.  Get away from my house.  Of course.  And he goes, and inside the stench and smell is coming out.  And neighbors are, and the owner of the house, like, pushes the camera guy.  You could see it.  And the reporter jumps in.  And he's like, don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  And they cut right back to the studio. 
[01:34:00]  And the guy goes, he goes, okay, let's cut away from that.  Let's cut away from that.  Why would you?  That's what I thought.  It's like, first of all, you're invading this guy's privacy.  He was a creep fucking douchebag hoarder.  But it's like, you're doing that to sensationalize shit.  But the second your reporter's involved, let's respect the privacy.  And these fucking, this piece of shit media, because it was, I guarantee it's legal reasons.  Because if it was somebody else getting into a tussle, you can fucking bet they would have filmed it. 
[01:34:30]  But if it's one of their own people, they don't.  They're just the most, I was thinking last night as I was taking a shit, honestly.  When did the media become so fucking absolutely hateable?  Like, years ago, during the Kennedy, when JFK was assassinated, a bunch of reporters said to Ted Kennedy, like, when you're ready to make a statement, we'll be here to hear it.  I can answer that.  Yes.  Inside Edition.  Is that it?  Those things.  Current Affair.  Yeah.  Maybe. 
[01:35:00]  Whichever one came first.  Current Affair before Inside Edition.  I think it was Current Affair.  The tabloid.  Yeah, because then all of a sudden it got blurred, and then regular news decided we got Current Affair so popular, and it's disguised as sort of a news program.  They all decide to do more of that.  I would probably blame Current Affair.  And the fact that cable now, there's 24 hours of news.  And the cable.  They have to.  They've got to fill it up with shit.  And they have to compete.  I think the two, yeah, those two things.  Might be right.  You've got to check this out.  Look how fucking deplorable this is.  So what is this again? 
[01:35:30]  A guy outside a house where there's an animal hoarder, and a hoarder.  And the house stinks, so the report is on scene, but the homeowner's there, too, and he's getting pissed that the news cameras are outside.  And why would they cut away from this?  They're just fucking, they're just the worst.  South Philadelphia, you never know what's behind closed doors, Chris.  Can you do this in process?  No, I can't, sir.  This is my property.  Thomas, we're live outside of what you just said.  Animal, the PSPCA is calling us one of the most bizarre cases of animal hoarding they've ever seen. 
[01:36:00]  Complaints over extreme stench coming out of this building, as well as the owner of this home apparently outside.  Hey, hey, hey, I'm getting, hey, hey, hey.  First of all, Chris, we want to know.  And that's when the guy, they cut out the part on the clip here on Fox where the guy goes, let's cut away from that.  Like there's, hey, hey, hey.  You cut away from it, really?  Wait, so the guy, is the reporter on his property? 
[01:36:30]  No, I think it's a city street.  And the hoarders probably should be executed for being a bum, but yeah.  Douchebag.  But it's just them cutting away and not letting it play out because, you know, they don't want to show the camera guy probably building him in his fucking dumb hoarder face.  And they've allotted a certain amount of seconds for the story because you have to get the weather.  The formula, you at the new shit called themselves, hi, we're formulaic cunts here again for exactly the same shit you heard last night. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  People still getting their news from like local news?  A lot of people aren't.  I pray they're not.  Ugh.  Seems just ridiculous at this point.  They're just a hateable, hateable group of people in the media.  Media lost it after the first Gulf War.  Yeah, maybe that was a part of it too in 1990.  Why?  Because of the constant round-the-clock coverage.  And they...  And cable, I think that's when all the news channels started popping up too in that time. 
[01:37:30]  That was 24-hour news of one story.  Yeah.  Because I think...  I'm not sure, but I think CNN at that point...  Did they have headline news and CNN?  I think it was just one.  Or it was one.  CNN was the biggie, obviously.  But CNN...  It was CNN headline news.  And that was like...  They would just run stories like every half hour they'd rerun the stories, add in some new shit as it happened.  But that's when they went 24-hour news on the Gulf War. 
[01:38:00]  And, yeah, that could have been it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Paul, what's up, buddy?  How much?  What's going on, guys?  Hi.  We're fucking here.  We're fucking here.  Going to work, too.  An eight-year-old boy was caught driving his father's pickup truck.  His father was passed out drunk in Mississippi, I think, in Dallas.  And some people saw erratic driving.  Called the police.  The state trooper pulled him over. 
[01:38:30]  His father's passed out drunk, opened a bottle.  And there's a four-year-old daughter in the back seat and all that.  How much trouble is that guy in?  Yeah.  I heard the kid was doing a pretty good job, though, in general.  I don't know how the hell he could hold on to pedals and all that.  And did you ever have to drive your dad's truck?  I've driven the truck, but never had to because he was too intoxicated.  How old were you when you started driving?  I don't know, like fucking 12, something like that.  Driving cars?  Yeah, yeah.  Doom buggies and pickup trucks all shift. 
[01:39:00]  That's pretty small.  Three on the column.  Yeah, that kid's fucking...  Wow, that's fucked up.  I knew what that guy looked like before he clicked on him.  Of course.  White trash.  That eight-year-old has a beard.  Oh, I see.  That's the father.  Oh, that's the father.  Letting him drive under the train.  No seatbelts.  I don't know if I mean no seatbelts on him.  Four-year-old.  Pickup truck.  To Mississippi.  And the guy was going there.  They were going to Dallas.  28-year-old guy.  What a dumbass.  Yep.  That's hilarious. 
[01:39:30]  What an ass.  Yeah, he is a fool.  His mugshot.  He is so hammered.  Isn't he?  He zooted, man.  I got like that off Zemus one time.  Got zooted?  Yeah, I was totally zooted, fucking spinning in a circle.  I fell.  I love being zooted.  Thank you, Paul.  All right.  Later.  Hey, you guys remember the band that canceled the show because of the pigeons?  Kings of Leon.  Same band?  Yeah.  That's in the...  Oh, my God.  What a baby that lead singer is. 
[01:40:00]  This is the same band.  What a fucking bunch of babies.  All right, there's your tease.  We'll do this next.  Oh, they did something else?  Oh, yeah.  It's even worse.  Really?  The singer has a pussy.  He has a pussy.  What a fruit.  What a fucking pussy.  All right, we'll explain next.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Attention anglers.  Still convinced that fishing is a sport?  Well, renowned sportsman James Norton presents the ultimate cure for your delusion. 
[01:40:30]  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  What a dumb animal the fish is.  Introducing, fishing is not a sport, you douche.  It's not a sport.  It's not a sport.  Go in the water with your fists and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger.  This collection is presented on nine full-length high-fidelity audio cassettes and will thoroughly  convince you that your leisure activity is a colossal waste of time.  You and some other jizz bucket and fucking waders and a big gut standing there in 10-degree 
[01:41:00]  water, drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon, trying to hook some asshole fish.  You're not a sportsman.  You're not out there sporting.  Despite what you may think, fishing is not a battle of wits.  It's not stacked equally between a dumb fucking fish who has been doing the same thing since  dinosaurs were shitting all over Manhattan.  Do you understand?  That fish was no smarter when a Tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th Street and Broadway.  Put down that stupid fishing pole and pick up your copies of Fishing is Not a Sport, 
[01:41:30]  you douche, narrated by James Norton.  I'm just letting you know, you're not a sportsman.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  On today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about his favorite photograph.  Yeah, that's Teddy. 
[01:42:00]  That's Teddy and his little brother.  The one on the other side's the girl.  She's kind of tomboyish.  She likes to play basketball.  Have her socks taken off.  Coochie coo, you tickle him in a tub.  Oh, Uncle Paul, my feet are dirty.  You wash them.  Get them in a tub.  Clean their feet good.  Take your shorts off.  Let me kiss your toes.  Oh yeah, they all had to stay in my bed, cause they all had bed bugs in their cribs. 
[01:42:30]  Come in here, so there's no bed bugs.  And then them goddamn parents are accusing me, saying, how come he ain't walking right?  I don't know.  I didn't do nothing.  Bunch of lies.  Those damn denar tests.  They said my denar was on the boy's hiney.  I don't know what that means.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul. 
[01:43:00]  She was a prom queen, who could have any guy she wanted.  He was a high school outcast looking for love.  Stay away from my girlfriend.  No matter how hard he tried, she would never notice him.  Until...  No, no, it's Bobo.  Bobo Loco.  Action.  Suspense. 
[01:43:30]  Tell me what it's all about.  The thrill ride of a lifetime.  Screaming for blood.  And looking for love.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  A man over the edge of insanity.  Bobo Loco.  I won't stop.  I won't stop.  Series XM.  Series XM. 
[01:44:00]  The opening of the show.  Yeah.  Let's not trip on fire.  I'm sorry.  Oh, this band again. 
[01:44:30]  Kings of Leon.  Fucking blow.  For what they do.  You like this, Ant?  I kind of like their music.  I'm not going to lie to you.  That's a little.  Leet Singer seems like he's a fucking wimp.  Dun, dun, dun.  Yeah.  They canceled one concert.  I don't know how long ago that was.  Maybe last summer or something.  Yeah.  Because what?  Pigeons pooped on them or something? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Into the mouth of what?  The guitarist?  Or...  I'm not really sure.  You have the story there, Sam?  Yeah.  There were pigeons in, like, the roof of this stage area.  Yeah.  Like an outdoor shell or whatever, right?  And one took a dump, and I think it went in his mouth, he said.  So they felt like they had to cancel the show because of that?  Yes.  Yes.  Very, very upset.  And then I guess over the weekend, Kings of Leon did it again.  They vowed to redo the too hot Dallas show.  So the Kings of Leon are promising a redo for their Dallas fans after canceling a show 
[01:45:30]  because their lead singer complained it was too hot to perform, leading other members  to profusely apologize to the audience.  Oh, so the lead singer's just a dick.  Mm-hmm.  How many times have you been at a concert and it's 90, 100 degrees?  Everyone's having a good-ass time.  And everybody is there to see them.  They're in the heat.  They came out.  Right.  They left their houses.  And then this motherfucker decides he's not going to go on. 
[01:46:00]  I don't know the Dallas setup, but in most cases, the people that are really overheated  are the fans because they're out in the sun.  Usually the band is the only ones that are in the shade.  Yeah.  And I don't know if this is the case here, but I'm sure he could fucking get anything  he wanted up there.  Fucking fans.  Let me tell his asshole.  I don't even know his name.  I'll tell you what's too hot.  Leon.  When you're a fucking 15-year-old kid and your job is to be a caddy.  Caddy.  And you're carrying about 60 to 70 pounds around a golf course. 
[01:46:30]  Golf course.  It's 100 degrees out, not a cloud in the sky.  And then to make it worse, they don't want to burn out their fairways, so they turn the  sprinklers on.  You would think that would be nice, but now it causes a sauna to come up from the ground.  Oh, yeah.  That's too fucking hot.  Steam bath.  Or how about the fucking fans that are roof workers?  Yeah, roofers.  And decided, you know what?  I'm going to go see Kings of Leon and forget the fact that I spend my summers on hot roofs.  Asphalt roofs. 
[01:47:00]  Fuck it.  This guy's a douchebag.  Yee.  Roofing sucks.  In a statement, the family rock band, known for hits including the Grammy Award, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, announced plans to return to Dallas on  September 21st to make up for Friday's mid-show cancellation, which drummer Nathan Follow Will  called a fiasco on Twitter.  The Kings of Leon apologized to their fans for the inconvenience this may have caused and  look forward to seeing their fans again in September.  On Friday, lead singer Caleb Follow Will, oh, they're brothers? 
[01:47:30]  There's brothers in this band?  No.  Repeatedly complained that it was too hot and that his voice was suffering because of it.  Get the fuck out of here.  Drink a little fucking tea with honey and suck it up.  Yeah.  My voice is completely 100% gone, he said.  Well, that's your problem, not the heat.  After a few more songs, he announced to the audience, I'm going to go backstage for a second.  I'm going to vomit.  I'm going to drink a beer and I'm going to come back out and play three more songs. 
[01:48:00]  He never did come back out, leaving the rest of the band to announce the abrupt end of the show to a booing audience.  Boo.  Good.  Not so good morning for me today, Nathan Follow Will tweeted.  Ashamed and embarrassed by last night's fiasco.  Can't apologize enough.  Hardly gutted.  A million I'm sorries.  Yeah, I think they're hinting that they're fucking leasing.  Wow, yeah.  Jared Follow Will tweeted.  They're all, oh, that's what they mean by a family band? 
[01:48:30]  It says the family rock band.  So I'm thinking, oh, they're family friendly?  No, it's all brothers.  Jared Follow Will tweeted.  Dallas, I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am.  There are internal sicknesses and problems that have needed to be addressed.  No words.  Oh, boy.  It's an issue.  He added, I love our fans so much.  I know you guys aren't stupid.  There are problems in our band bigger than not drinking enough Gatorade.  So they're hinting that the lead singer is a cunt. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  He probably doesn't get along with his brothers and threw a little hissy fit.  I hate lead singers.  Hate them.  Dude, he canceled the show because it was too hot.  And I'm telling Anthony, when I was a kid, I was a caddy.  That's too hot in the summer.  Or working on a roof is too hot in the summer.  Or working in these attics in the summer is too hot.  Well, he said his voice went and he couldn't see.  He had to puke.  But if he wasn't such a bitch the last time at the bird shit, I would have more like,  well, maybe it happens.  He just sounds like a bitch.  Yeah.  Was he the one that got the bird shit, though?  Or was that Kings of Leon? 
[01:49:30]  I thought it was.  No, it was the same band.  And I'm just wondering if it happened to him and he was the reason they canceled that  show, too.  Or walked off.  A bunch of sissies.  The whole family.  However, the statement released by the band did not address other troubles and said Caleb  suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration.  Caleb!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Caleb was tired!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  They looked like fucking wishy-washy twats. 
[01:50:00]  Causing his vocal cords to see.  So someone's trying to, you know, protect him.  Look at that.  They look like four pretentious, spoiled cunts.  Yeah, but the brothers are hinting that, you know, their brother's an asshole.  Yeah, they're right, but they're assholes, too.  They're hinting.  They're assholes.  Four fruits.  There's real problems in the band.  The Kings of Leon.  Caleb!  It was too hot for Caleb.  Caleb or Caleb.  Whatever it is.  It's because of the C. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, cunt-ib.  And the music is terrible.  Mike, where are you from, brother?  Jersey.  Where are you from, Mike?  Jersey.  Lindhurst?  Yeah, Lindhurst, New Jersey.  Oh, wow.  The lead singer of Kings of Leon, right before this album came out, he admitted that he was  hitting the painkillers pretty hard.  Why?  Because he can't handle the fame?  You're living in a glass box, man.  Man! 
[01:51:00]  You don't even know, man.  You don't understand the struggles.  Yeah, work at a hardware store, you faggot.  Shut up.  His name's Caleb, I guess.  Not Caleb.  Oh, whatever.  Caleb.  I'm a bird in a gilded cage, man.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I'm flying to obscurity, Jeff Bucket.  Go fucking get a job at Bradley's.  What's that, sir?  Are you trying to hold it?  Yeah, I don't know why the music has to be fucking blaring.  Well, Y-Rock, we're trying to have a conversation with the guy, and you have this at fucking  megaphones. 
[01:51:30]  What are you dreaming about, Y-Rock?  Yeah, what are you thinking about besides not this?  What comic book toy are you pretending you're playing with?  What was your tweet about memorabilia over the weekend?  You got on your high horse.  He was saying that he remembered bilia.  It's a lady he knew once.  What was your tweet from the weekend?  Y-Rock radio.  A guy I know was trying to buy some baseball stuff.  Try the music down for yourself, I see.  Selfish.  Yeah, that's nice. 
[01:52:00]  Go ahead.  He was looking at baseball stuff on eBay, and I was telling him that most of this stuff  is bullshit, because all these certificate of authenticities are just shit that these  people print out and fake the signature, but he wouldn't believe me.  Well, if you're going to forge a fucking baseball, you'll forge a certificate of authenticity.  Yes.  What the fuck's that?  Unless you watch the guy sign it, how do you ever believe it?  I mean, I got a Kurt Cobain.  I don't know.  You don't know if it's real.  I wasn't there.  It's not real, the one you have.  I don't know.  Dr. Steve claims it is.  Maybe.  There are certain places you buy from. 
[01:52:30]  Like, Big Kev was showing me, like, one of the places, the Chiller Theaters or whatever.  He goes, there are certain guys that are very reputable, and you just, you learn to trust  them because they have been doing it a long time.  And I've seen some on the walls that you know that they're real, because they're written  in pen, and they're fading.  It's like, to Jerry.  Like, someone wouldn't have done that.  Who would fake that?  They would have gotten a nice Sharpie and made it, try to make it look like they think it  should look.  Like, I would never go to one of those places in the mall that sells signed baseballs. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, that's fucking crap.  Got more info about Kings of Leon.  Thank you, Mike and Linhurst.  Should be called Queens of Leon.  That's right, Jimmy.  That's right.  Caleb, the singer.  What do you got there, Chris?  Oh, yeah.  The show in Dallas is, it was a night show, too.  So it wasn't even like they were out in the sun.  Oh, it was a night show?  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  I live in Houston, so it's even a little bit warmer.  They canceled the next night show here in Houston because he was still fucking tired. 
[01:53:30]  They're hateable when you look at them.  They're like emo fruits.  Yeah.  Look at them.  Yeah, I'm not going back to a different show.  Pain, hurt, pain, get me hurt.  Me, me, no me, notice pain, hurt, sad.  You ain't fucking queer shit.  Pain, hurt, sad.  Fucking dickheads.  I fucking hate this pussy rock.  Me, me.  Oh, my God.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me? 
[01:54:00]  Because I need you to notice me.  Oh, it's me, me, me, me, me, me.  You fucking Peter Pumper.  I remember when I met you, you noticed me, me, me, me, me, hurting me, pain me, sad me,  hug me, talk about me, sing about me.  Fuck yourself.  What's the name of that number, Jimmy? 
[01:54:30]  It's me with three E's.  Me.  Let me say hi to Trevor.  Trevor.  Hey, how's it going?  Love you guys listening to the show all the time.  First time calling.  Hi, Trevor.  Where are you?  Trevor, I'm going to guess you're from Chicago.  I am from Chicago.  All right.  We're talking about these goofballs.  Canceling a show.  Paul McCartney, 69 years old.  Go to the concert at Wrigley last night.  Unbelievable.  Guy played for three hours without a break. 
[01:55:00]  90 degrees, maybe 95, 100% humidity.  The guy didn't stop.  He can make a complaint.  69 years old.  That's why Kings of Leon, they're just a bunch of fucking Marys.  Paul McCartney, let's say it again, 69.  Yeah, it's coming in from Mike Moody as well.  Three-hour show last night in Chicago.  He's saying it was 92 degrees and about 70% humidity.  That's a fucking nightmare for Paul McCartney.  He probably sounded amazing.  Right.  Probably the best concert ever. 
[01:55:30]  He does a pretty good, just when we saw him, too.  Amazing.  He does a great set list.  He pulls out a couple that weren't as big.  He does a few that you wouldn't expect.  He's really fun to watch live.  Yeah.  And he's doing another show tonight, so he has to turn around and do it again.  Was Wrigley Field sold out, sir?  What do you think?  It was packed.  I don't know.  There wasn't a team in the house.  Does he do that kind of numbers?  I don't know what McCartney does.  He's still doing those numbers.  Isn't that amazing?  Fucking Phil Stadiums.  Wait, he's really 69? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, 69 years old.  Punching out, guys.  All right, thanks, man.  Great day.  Love the show.  Holy shit, man.  There you go.  There's no one in music that wouldn't watch him live.  Like, no one who does music could go and watch him live and not be blown away, impressed.  Yeah.  So it sounds like this kid might have a little problem that goes way beyond heat, huh?  Dude, he didn't acknowledge the fucking Keith Richards and...  Oh, yeah.  You're talking about Paul.  I'm talking about the kids.  Who else is in the audience?  Keith Richards and Ron Wood.  Ron Wood.  Ron Wood, yeah.  He just went, oh, non-famous people applaud for the... 
[01:56:30]  Like, that's...  Yeah, that's him.  That's a guy who's just great.  Fucking...  Let's say hi to Denise.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  That's a stupid song.  What's your name?  Oh, hello?  Hello, this is Denise.  Hi, Denise.  Hi, Denise.  Hi, guys.  Hey, how is the feet?  How is...  Oh, how is the what?  No, Denise.  I thought you were going to say, how's the nephew?  That's even funnier.  I was going with Denise.  I've never heard that one before.  Of course.  Oh, you see?  But you never heard defeat, did you? 
[01:57:00]  That's true.  Or how's the thyroid?  All right, go ahead.  Uh-huh.  They're bombing in stereo.  Yeah, you really were.  I saw you two a couple weeks ago in Nashville, and it was a...  Where were we?  Thank you.  Welcome to Pun City.  Mayor McCuntface here.  Sorry.  All right, go ahead, Denise.  I apologize.  Wow.  No, no, that's okay.  All right.  I saw you two a couple weeks ago in Nashville.  Yes.  And it was 101 degrees, open air. 
[01:57:30]  Bono performed the whole night wearing a leather jacket and leather pants.  Exactly.  Good thing he cares about animals.  Ugh.  God.  I was a bum.  I knew what that ass must have smelled like.  Leather.  And money.  Oh, true.  Who cares?  But he didn't stop performing at all.  I mean, completely.  You know, completely.  He never took off his jacket until the end of the show.  But, I mean, it was hot.  And, you know, he performed, put on a great show.  Didn't change anything.  So, that kind of pussy.  It was in the paper today.  That tour is finally over.  Made $750 million, I believe. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  I guess the difference is when you're making that, you do perform no matter what.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Yeah.  Highest grossing concert ever.  Wow.  Or tour or whatever.  It was a three-year tour, wasn't it?  Amazing.  Am I crazy?  You're crazy, but you also might be right.  Close.  People tell me I'm nuttier than a fruitcake.  Meatloaf.  Yeah, what happened to him?  Now, we just had the Kings of Leon story.  Well, a similar thing was going on with Meatloaf.  Meatloaf refuses to quit show after collapsing on stage. 
[01:58:30]  But he's a drama queen.  Yeah, he really is.  He's overly dramatic all the fucking time.  I love him.  He's nuts.  He is as crazy as they come.  I hope he comes back on this show.  We didn't do that interview justice because he's nuts.  He passes out.  Oh, man.  That's the video, huh?  It's on TMZ.  All right. 
[01:59:00]  That's what you want to hear.  We love your meat.  We love your meat.  Is he playing at a Friday's?  Yeah, listen to this.  There's no one there.  Oh, what a chip.  We didn't hear Paradise by the Dashboard Lights before Meat hit the stage.  Meat.  Yeah, what happened? 
[01:59:30]  What happened?  Like twice as many of you,  I f***ing fainted.  I have asthma.  I can't breathe.  Wow.  And then...  Oh, wait.  I forgot.  I got poked by a pin and bled half to death.  And then...  I got slapped in the face.  I got slapped in the face. 
[02:00:00]  And my tooth is loose.  I'm very upset.  My shoes fell off.  I would do anything for love.  And I can't see, God damn it.  And my pin poked me and I bled to death.  Fucking Meatloaf.  But I won't do that.  No, I won't do that.  Fucking Meatloaf. 
[02:00:30]  What a douche.  Thousands of...  They just make Bartlett do these...  He's dressed in full Elvis regalia.  Oh, what an ass.  It's the radio.  We need that up there so we can go to the volume.  Get it on the show.  Why don't we just put it up there?  I can't do it that way.  No, no, not you.  I mean, somebody else.  You've been asking for that for six months.  We have to do it over days.  Hey, just keep whatever channel is on it.  Over days.  Keeps playing that United Healthcare commercial, though, with the surfboard girl.  Yeah.  Don't turn that off.  You like that one, huh?  I can watch that a million fucking times. 
[02:01:00]  I have.  I know, like, MSNBC or something plays it every single commercial break.  God.  Well, you're righty, so it must be on Fox.  No, it isn't.  It's on MSNBC.  You don't watch MSNBC, though.  I watch it right up there.  That's for lefties.  Thousands of terrified fans saw the 63-year-old Bat Out of Hell singer collapse in the middle  of his number one hit, I Would Do Anything for Love.  Oh, it was during that song.  With many at the fearing he had suffered a heart attack. 
[02:01:30]  With many at the fearing?  With many fearing.  Yeah, that's what I would think it would be.  But the veteran singer clearly believed heaven can wait.  As he dusted himself off and finished the show, despite lying unconscious on the floor  for ten minutes, surrounded by AIDS.  AIDS?  Oh.  Wow.  I think I didn't get him.  Surrounded.  He made light of the incident before performing classic...  Notice they say made light.  Made light of the...  Yeah, yeah.  Lightheaded, yeah.  He made light of the incident before performing classic tune... 
[02:02:00]  What?  Someone had a bertation when they were typing this shit up.  Yeah, this is fucked up.  And this came from the AP.  He made light of the incident before performing classic tune, Paradise by the Dashboard Light.  Saying, I fucking fainted.  I have asthma.  I can't breathe.  And then, yeah.  Alright, dude.  Heard the rest.  And then he goes into Paradise by the Dashboard Light.  Oh.  One fan tweeted, kept sucking on his inhaler and singing his ass off.  That's what you want to say.  What the fuck?  A little primatine mist and then start singing to an underage girl on stage with you. 
[02:02:30]  I'll say it again, man.  There was a documentary that MSG fucking had on about a year, year and a half ago.  Meatloaf.  You gotta watch it.  Yeah.  If you're into rock shit.  Just a lunatic.  A lunatic that has many fucking weird little issues.  That's your music news.  Yeah.  That's your music news.  We're your music news headquarters.  Amy Winehouse tops the UK charts in Week After Death.  That's so weird that we all search out music of people that died. 
[02:03:00]  Every fucking time.  I'm guilty of it.  I've been listening to a lot of Amy Winehouse lately.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Why?  Because you think of them more when they're dead.  You're like, oh, yeah.  Because they're not in the forefront of our mind all the time.  And then when someone dies, everyone goes, oh, yeah, that person.  I mean, she obviously was a good person.  I think that's all it is.  And, you know, nothing new is ever going to come out.  Yeah.  True.  Well, unless you're Tupac.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  Or Tupac.  Do you say Tupac or Tupac?  I say Tupac. 
[02:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  I say X-Pac.  Mm-hmm.  Suck it.  Yeah, okay.  Suck it.  My taint hurts.  Why?  Oh.  I think because I was in the pool a lot over the weekend.  And I had, like, my swim trunks on, but I had underwear on under them.  Ooh.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Why?  Why do you do that?  Well, a lot of times, just because that netting.  That netting.  You know the netting in the swim trunks?  I tear mine out immediately. 
[02:04:00]  Head right for the kiddie pool.  It hurts.  It's like a cheese grater on the head of your dick.  I hate the netting.  Stop with the netting.  You're right.  But you need some kind of support, because you don't want your fucking dick dropping through  the side of your fucking shorts.  Yeah, that'd be terrible if your cock fell out.  Of course you do.  That's exactly why you wear swim trunks.  But usually when I'm done, what I do is I would then take the wet stuff off and put on  dry clothing.  But I sat around for a while.  Did you get a diaper rash?  I sat around for a while in the wet fucking undies and swim trunks. 
[02:04:30]  You got a rash.  And I think it's either a rash or maybe as it was drying, the underwear was folded or  something and pinching part of the taint.  How old are you that that happened to you?  What do you mean?  How do you get hurt on your taint?  I never have.  That's a baby's injury.  This is a first.  When I was just walking to take a piss, I was walking like the Duke.  I had to walk like the Duke. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, someone has a chafed taint.  I have a chafed taint.  I'll bring in some of that butt cream I use on my son if you like.  Yeah, maybe you could try it.  Like rub some baby fucking lotion.  Someone's going to have to apply it, though.  I'll apply it.  Of course you will.  My fist.  Of course you will.  With the fucking heel on my fucking shoe.  I'd love to put some Desinex on the heel on my shoe and apply it to Anthony's taint.  Just fucking slam it onto my taint.  No, I would put it on your taint the way you scrape your heel on a curb when there's  dog shit on it.  That's how I would apply fucking Desinex to your balls and taint. 
[02:05:30]  Sharp downward motion.  It didn't help, but the pool was 112 fucking degrees over the...  Holy shit.  Wait, what night did I go over there?  That was Friday night.  It was the most homoerotic thing because the hot tub, the aunt's lights aren't working  because there's some kind of a power outage.  So fucking...  Me and the fruit.  It's just me and Jimmy.  We're going to get in the hot tub together in the dark.  And it was just too hot, so we went into the pool. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, we're just torch lights going because we had all the torches burning in the yard.  But I had turned the jacuzzi on and turned the heat up and left it that way for much too  long.  Yeah.  And then when Jimmy came over, you know, we were just yapping for a while and then it's  like, oh yeah, fucking go in the jacuzzi.  Couldn't even get in.  It was blazing fucking hot.  The pool was actually hot.  Yeah, the pool ended up being fucking hot.  When I saw the dial, it was set to solar flare.  That's why you fucking...  Why don't you make your house like nude only? 
[02:06:30]  It's your house.  And then you won't have the chafing.  Because 90% of the people that are over, I don't want to see nude.  Good point.  I'll give a good 10%.  Good point.  Fuck, that's a good one too.  I ain't no good.  Yeah, she's really terrific.  She was.  I couldn't stop going.  Go, go, go.  The patty version.  Go.  We got to get her in here to do it again. 
[02:07:00]  I can't buy one.  Go, go, go.  Go.  I got to take a leak.  You got to go wee-wees?  Did we talk enough?  How's your taint?  Yeah, you did.  Did we talk enough?  This is a short one then, huh?  We could go short every once in a while.  We do.  Hour and a half sometimes.  Yes, man.  Or you guys continue.  I don't give a fuck.  I need to take a fucking leak.  Go pay.  Go tinkle.  I came back in late because I was pissing.  Take a break.  Give a shit.  We're all scared to leave.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:07:30]  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  Isn't it amazing that every 15 minutes we used to have to take a break?  I remember that.  On terrestrial radio?  The old days.  You had to take a break at 15 minutes.  Yeah.  Kelsey Grammer wants to run for mayor in New York.  Isn't that just, is that really, or is that just to promote a show?  He has a show coming on stage.  Oh, is it?  Who knows?  Oh, yeah, that's all it is.  He's playing, uh.  He's playing, uh.  He's playing stunts.  Shut up.  Is he playing a mayor?  I don't know.  I'm going to guess.  I think he's playing a mayor in a new show called. 
[02:08:00]  The Boss, I think.  Is that what I read today?  That sounds right.  I'm not 100% sure that it sounds right.  Fuck God.  Some of this stuff is just clean.  His personal life is a disaster.  No, I think you're right.  Isn't it?  No, it's not.  He got rid of that bitch.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Like, it's all, he's always got some bitch he's got to get rid of.  You watch the Housewife shows.  I've seen the one with his.  Camille?  Ex on it or whatever it is.  Camille.  She is so fucking hot.  You certainly would put up with her hotness for a few years.  Maybe, maybe when she was younger, she's got so much work. 
[02:08:30]  They all had so much work done.  They look fucking horrific.  You watch Housewives?  I've seen that one.  Probably five episodes ago.  If you want to be annoyed, watch the Housewives.  That's what happens.  I think they're important.  They have so much money, they just hire, like, all these people to try to make them into  something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they have no talent whatsoever.  They're awful.  They get, like, voice coaches and this and that.  And they put out books that no one really fucking buys.  That no one cares about.  And they're all just bitches. 
[02:09:00]  Bitches.  No, I've seen that.  They annoy the piss out of me.  You've got to see New Jersey Housewives, great.  The fucking, what is it, California?  Yeah, Beverly Hills or something.  Beverly Hills.  What do they call it?  Which one?  Orange County?  No, no, no, no.  The Housewives of Beverly Hills, right?  Beverly Hills, I guess.  And then the New York one's really good, too.  Yeah, I've only watched the ones with his wife in it.  Is it a chick show officially?  Am I digging a chick show?  It's on the border because it's annoying enough for guys where if you want to get pissed 
[02:09:30]  off, you could watch it without feeling too faggy.  So it's almost acceptable?  Almost.  Almost acceptable.  As far as reality goes, I was all about toddlers and tiaras this weekend.  They had a marathon going.  And these are just mothers that you want to fucking just smash in the head with shovels.  And there was another show called Dance Moms.  Oh, my God.  And what they do is, it's an excuse. 
[02:10:00]  They bide time by putting the mothers on arguing with each other.  But it's really an excuse to show pre-teen girls in spandex and bikini bottoms and tops.  But then they occasionally go to the mothers and it's like, hey, my daughter's great.  No, mine's better than yours.  Why do you treat her like that?  All right, now roll some more fucking video footage of some future stripper dressed like  a little hua.  Like a little hua. 
[02:10:30]  Just the fact that this is acceptable, it's just so fucking great.  Yeah.  They showed one mom.  Yeah, it is great.  It's entertaining as hell.  They showed one mom as she's talking to her daughter walking out of the room.  She goes, look, if you forget your routine, just shake your ass.  Right.  And the kid had to be 12.  And they go out there and they do these routines where it's like, you could so tell that girl's  going to be on a pole in like fucking six more years.  They soak in every fucking thing, man. 
[02:11:00]  Ah.  These kids.  But that one's funny.  I don't watch that one, Ann.  I'm sorry.  That one's Toddlers and Tiaras is hysterical.  There's this girl, Mackenzie.  Yeah.  And she's been in a couple.  She's going to be the breakout star.  Just a little fucking brat.  The brattiest fucking thing.  Screaming at her mother with a fucking, like one of the, whatever you call them, those pacifier  things.  A whoop-o.  It's like a nook or something.  You got to find a video of her just yelling at something.  Just yelling. 
[02:11:30]  She's so fucking annoying.  Mackenzie, I'm four years old and I am a beaut queen.  I need to be impacted until you take care of some fancy clothes.  How old is she, 90?  I'm not doing what you tell me.  Okay.  I'm not doing what you tell me.  I'm doing whatever I want.  Mom's hot.  She is an only child.  Why are we doing this? 
[02:12:00]  It's not too hot.  Get that out of here.  How old is she?  I don't know.  She's like six now.  Yeah.  They had a comeback for another episode from this season.  So she's a little older, but she's like such a brat.  I'll get it for you.  I'll get it for you.  She's constantly yells.  I love the music.  Yeah.  Dun, dun, dun.  So good.  That goes everywhere with her.  Sounds like home alone music or something.  She calls it her ninny like we call E-Rock. 
[02:12:30]  Our ninny.  That was a good one.  Our ninny.  Ninny.  Ninny.  She's calling Ninny.  She's running around trying to find her ninny.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  Listen to her.  Ninny.  You want to drink this?  Ninny.  And she punches her mother.  Yeah.  Get that.  Ninny is McKenzie's passy.  She really likes the ninny. 
[02:13:00]  Fat neck mother.  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  Too fat for beauty contest, mom.  Is that what it was?  All these mothers, they're too fat, so they live vicariously through their kids.  Fucking fat, vapid cunts.  It's awful.  And then when the kids start falling asleep and getting really tired during the pageants,  they shove pixie sticks down their throat, pure sugar.  One girl, they were just blatantly giving her sugar cubes.  Like here, throwing sugar cubes and having them drink Red Bull and Coke. 
[02:13:30]  Like in the fucking...  And they're six.  The fact that people just will actually go to this is fucking sickening.  Oh, I know.  It's blatant like child abuse.  It's guys who want to jerk off looking at children.  That's what kind of guy would watch...  In the privacy of your own home.  But that's who would fucking...  What type of male is really interested in this shit?  That would go to this?  Yeah, yeah.  If you're a parent and you do it, you're a fucking...  You're a contribute nothing.  Oh, yeah.  Add up to nothing.  Live through your kid.  And if you're an adult who watches this, you're probably a pedophile. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Enough of this kid.  Oh, she stinks.  It was...  But so fucking annoying.  Like, this is fine.  It's just goofy.  Oh, no.  Then when they get them in fucking, you know, lingerie, pretty much.  The fact they put makeup and lingerie on them or whatever is just...  What are you doing?  Well, that's what we call a glitz pageant.  It's glitz.  They got to wear the big hair and the makeup.  My name's Mackenzie. 
[02:14:30]  It rhymes with Lindsay.  I'm like a dolly.  What?  This kid's good.  I'm four years old.  I feel like a superstar.  A superstar.  I'm Anna and my daughter Mackenzie is an unforgettable pageant queen.  And I think she's a reflection of me because I've amounted to nothing.  But I think if she's something, that I'll be something too.  Exactly.  You're driving me nuts.  She's just a force on and off stage.  White gloves?  Yeah, but...  That kid's an asshole.  No! 
[02:15:00]  No way!  Don't push me!  Stay off!  No!  I don't!  This is the shit that cracks me up.  It's unbelievable.  I love when they throw temper tantrums.  He was just saying...  My kid acted like that.  I would just...  No!  ...set him outside.  You didn't smile.  I didn't see your teeth.  But since the Paris pageant, Mackenzie has matured.  She's matured and she's grown as a performer.  It's so fucking funny watching kids take headers off the stage and shit like that.  She's fucking three!  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:15:30]  They have sparkles.  They're putting big fake eyelashes on them.  Just this fucking fat-faced cunt of a mother.  Yeah.  I hope a fucking donkey kicks her in the pussy.  I hope just a brain donkey backkicks her right in her fat white lady pussy.  Knocks her down a flight of stairs.  Why would there be a donkey in her upstairs?  I have no idea.  It's just there.  Perhaps it wandered in carrying coffee.  Just to kick her in the pussy.  It came in. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, hateable.  More importantly...  I'm with Chris.  Yeah.  Why do you have netting in your swim trunks?  They all do.  They have a netting.  No, man.  They have netting.  I wasn't sure, but now that I'm...  Now that we got Chris on the line here...  If you don't know what netting...  No, I think most adults don't have netting in their swim trunks.  Anthony, can I talk before you start hammering me?  Ooh.  Someone knows Anthony.  Someone knows swim trunks.  Wow.  Someone knows Long Island and the faggot that's had netting in his shorts when everybody else 
[02:16:30]  hasn't had it for 20 years.  All right.  Get a pair of board shorts, for Christ's sake.  Look, I have...  Go ahead.  No, you go ahead.  You talk.  I have many different types of swim trunks, shorts, things that are made just for swimming,  some other that are made as shorts that I'll just jump in the pool with them on, like cut-offs.  But the ones I was wearing over the weekend had netting in them.  And I don't know why...  Did Dreamweaver buy them for you? 
[02:17:00]  What?  Did Dreamweaver buy them for you back in 82?  Your fucking phone sucks, dude.  It's a landline.  Don't yell at me.  What did you just say?  You keep crapping out.  Maybe it's our connection.  No, yeah.  I know this game.  It is almost funny when they know.  Yeah, I know.  It's better, I guess.  Anthony, do your trunks come down to like halfway through your thigh and the top of your white  thigh is showing?  Are you fucking really? 
[02:17:30]  You want to see my tan lines, you fucking fruit?  Dude, come on.  What?  What, homo?  Oh, dude.  What's the matter, homo?  Dude, we're Long Island guys.  We gotta stick together.  Just stick together, you South Shore piece of shit.  Whoa, what did he do to you, man?  It just got real all of a sudden.  Dude, you come to Long Beach and suck so much cock.  Where's Long Beach?  Stop talking to your father.  I'm on the phone with you.  No.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  I don't even want to fight you.  I like you too much.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, the guy likes you.  So likable.  It's obvious. 
[02:18:00]  You have like seven listeners left.  Come on.  I'm one of them.  All right.  Your dog's barking.  Spread the peanut butter thin.  All right.  Take it easy, Massapequa.  Had it with you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Suck it.  Get some netted trunks fruit.  Well, stop getting them from nettedtrunks.com.  I know.  All I heard was sexual tension there.  Yeah, it was hot right.  Wow.  Between you and Chris.  A couple people that really want to fuck each other's hiney holes.  There are still shorts that they make with netting in it.  I don't know.  But I don't like it. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't remember the last time I had netting.  And I always like some type of support.  So I would usually wear...  I'm with you.  Some type of tighty-whities underneath the shorts.  Thank you for the support, Jim.  Just walk around cupping my balls and holding them up.  Could you?  I would.  My nickname in high school was Netfingers McGillicuddy.  So I'm sure you'll be happy with my...  That McGillicuddy.  Boy, she gets around.  Sure does.  Yeah, I just...  I like the support. 
[02:19:00]  I hear you.  All right, we should break.  Sam, is today the day you ask for a race?  Oh, shit.  Is Monday the day I always forget?  I don't even know.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, we got you.  What's more strategic, Monday, Wednesday, or Friday to ask for the race?  Friday, no one pays attention to anything.  No, no.  Monday, they're tired from the weekend.  So I'm thinking Tuesday or Wednesday.  Tuesday or Wednesday is when...  Let's make Wednesday the day every week you have to ask for a race.  You agree?  I don't know what you're talking about, and that's not something that I have to do anyway.  What do you think?  This is no fucking... 
[02:19:30]  You can't plead the fifth in this fucking...  Exactly.  ...room.  What is this?  They get a horrible beard.  They got to him.  They got to him.  That's why I brought it up.  They got to him.  They scared him.  There's a few...  Well, I would say all of them don't understand that we like to exaggerate shit on this radio  show.  Yeah, they take everything quite literally.  And they get really, really mad.  They don't understand that Sam just talking about that whole thing and the mental picture  that it conjures up of Sam every week going in like clockwork and having to ask for a 
[02:20:00]  raise is funny.  It's humorous.  But they take it as, hey, don't...  I didn't say every week.  Like, did you hear it on the show?  Then don't fucking take it as 100%, okay?  What's wrong with those people down there?  Nothing.  Do they understand what this is?  Sam's not going to talk.  You know, I've seen fucking burn victims with better beards than you have.  I just...  That fucking beard is horrendous.  It's not like a beard.  No, it's not.  It's spotty hair.  No, Jess is.  Ah! 
[02:20:30]  Beard.  I'm not gay.  Oh, okay.  Beard is terrible.  What's going on there?  Doesn't even grow in on the side.  What happens?  What do you scratch it?  What do you have, eczema on your face?  You scratch it?  Nervous Nelly.  He's still a kid.  That's why.  I wish.  He used to be.  Yeah.  He's past that kid point now.  Oh, he is.  What are you now, 30?  32?  What are you now?  27.  So, will you be asking for a raise this week?  I mean...  I may take it upon myself to raise the question at some point. 
[02:21:00]  He can't shut up.  They got him.  He can't shut up, though.  They got him.  They got him so bad.  It's now his problem that, you know, he wants money.  How do they spin it that way?  That's just amazing to me.  That it becomes your problem that you're asking for more money.  Got him all fucking in a tizzy.  I don't know exactly.  I mean, at some point, I might raise the question with somebody.  Could be this week, but again, it would be my doing. 
[02:21:30]  So, ah, yes.  Indeed.  We'll make this one quick, too.  I know there's someone on the management team that went behind someone's back and talked  to this certain person's boss.  That is so fucking not cool.  For what?  Oh, shit.  And I just want you to know that I know.  What'd they talk to the boss for?  I heard about that.  What happened?  I'm just going to keep it like that.  I heard about that, too.  That is a bullshit maneuver.  Was it for something the person did wrong? 
[02:22:00]  I'm going to keep it vague.  Well, that's vague.  But I just want this person to know that I know.  But should they have talked to that person's boss?  No.  Just another fucking reason why we'll never get along.  Because you don't understand how the radio show goes.  I'm not letting that slide.  No way.  Because what happened that day was great radio.  Too bad it was at your fucking expense.  And then it turned around behind someone's back and talked to their boss about it.  Behind.  That's fucking bullshit.  And I just want you to know that I know. 
[02:22:30]  And that's not going to help relations at all.  Thank you.  I don't know.  Look at E-Rock.  You don't know.  I just see one handout.  You don't know.  All right, E-Rock.  Here he comes.  Please play.  It's going to be close.  Here's the throw.  Here's the play of the plate.  Holy cow.  I think he's going to make it.  Stop right there.  I got to know right now. 
[02:23:00]  Before we go any further, do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  And will you make me your wife?  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  And will you make me your wife?  I gotta know right now. 
[02:23:30]  Before we go any further, do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Let me sleep on it.  Baby, baby, let me sleep on it.  Let me sleep on it.  And I'll give you my answer in the morning.  Let me sleep on it.  Baby, baby, let me sleep on it.  Let me sleep on it.  I'll give you my answer in the morning. 
[02:24:00]  Let me sleep on it.  Baby, baby, let me sleep on it.  Let me sleep on it.  I'll give you my answer in the morning.  I gotta know right now  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy  For the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  Will you make me your wife?  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further

She's wearing a little Smurfette dress  And those giant tits of hers  You think she painted her pussy blue  In honor of the movie?  Now we'd be talking  Yeah  Hey, what is Rotten Tomatoes giving the Smurfs there, Sam?  I think 36  36  I know how much it made  I'm wondering how the reviews are, though  Oh, silly  Yeah, the Smurfs are the number one box office movie thing  20%  20% positive reviews  Is that from the critics, though? 
[02:32:30]  Or the  Because the critics  Of course  It's just a kid's movie, right?  65% of the people like that  65% of the audience, exactly  And that's why these bad movies continue to be made  But is it bad, or is it just a kid's movie?  It just takes a lot for someone to say a movie sucks  Kids movie, yeah  I guess they enjoy being at the movie theater  And taking in the whole experience  It's always  20% positive reviews from the critics  65% positive reviews from the people going  I collected Smurfs when they came out  Because I thought they'd be worth money  I did 
[02:33:00]  Cover your face, Ant  I had a bunch of them  Why?  You don't want to be part of this  No  I don't have them anymore  I get rid of them  You collected them, really?  For briefly, yeah  Cowboys and Aliens  That's a major disappointment  We saw the previews and the trailers  Yeah  Since Super Bowl  Since the Super Bowl  Yeah  Turns out the movie's just okay, right, Ant?  43%  On Rotten Maters  63 by the audience  What did it make?  How do you fuck up a movie called Cowboys and Aliens?  Cowboys and Aliens  I think the name of that just sounds really 
[02:33:30]  I don't know  It just sounds like it's  Cowboys fucking fighting aliens?  It would do nothing for me  I wouldn't say that  Ant  I'll be out here  Definitely  That sounds cool  It just sounds kind of cool  I like the whole idea behind it, too  But, uh  You know  Captain America  Maybe if somebody's, you know  Fucking, uh  Publicist  Allowed somebody to be on this program  Maybe  He wasn't allowed on the program  After you shot guns with him?  You know, publicists are  They're just terrible  Yeah  Captain America is still doing well 
[02:34:00]  Really?  It did another 25 million  Wow  So it's probably over 100 million already  And look, positive reviews  Both sides  I heard it was good  People digging it  78% and then 82% by the, uh  The moviegoer  We lost our music?  What happened?  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 2  I think those movies have made over a billion now  Officially or something like that  Yeah  What was the stat in the paper today?  Wow  It was Lana Turner  96% and 92% by the audience 
[02:34:30]  That's rare that critics like it more  Crazy  It's definitely a good movie  And what's Crazy Stupid Love?  I don't know that one  Crazy Stupid Love  Is it a rom-com?  It's a rom-com  It's a chick flick  Another crazy movie with Steve Carell  I hate Steve Carell  Look out, come on now  Come on, this looks crazy  Is it okay to say you hate Steve Carell?  Yeah  That he plays the same fucking guy  And everything he does  It's absolutely okay  Is it okay?  It's actually mandatory 
[02:35:00]  I loved him on The Daily Show  And I loved him on The Office  The first few seasons  And then, I don't know  Is he overexposed or something?  Even The 40-Year-Old Virgin was funny  I liked him in that  When it first came out  Now, in hindsight, you look  And it just seems like another one of his dumb movies  But, uh  Is this the official trailer for Crazy Stupid Love?  You have nothing to say?  I'll just say it  I slipped with something  I keep pausing this  Automatically  All the trailers should be killed  Let's stop this one a lot 
[02:35:30]  It's all they do is the same formulaic shit  People are writing for cadence  And timing  And not, like, humor or reality  Right  It's like, that's what the laugh track did  The sitcoms  Ba ba ba  Bla laugh  Bu ba ba  Bla laugh  Not realistic at all  Well, I don't think so  Well, that's because you're a  Bla blast  La blast  The trailer  Yeah  Hey, hold on  You know what we should do?  None of us 
[02:36:00]  Make love  Trailer, right?  Well, later, Jimmy  Later  uh let's let's point out what we're about to see here okay shite well yeah but what what  typical trailer garbage about to see right the fuck now obviously the piano at the beginning  then the the voiceover like there's going to be them talking in the car then you get the voice  over guy okay kind of telling you what the story is wait will it stop first dan or no  will it go like ding ding ding ding and then the voiceover guy or when the voiceover guy come in 
[02:36:30]  i'm not sure the order but okay but all these things will be in there there could be a record  scratch before a stop oh god i think it's more what okay fair what kind of like uh dialogue and  bullshit are we about to see here a lot a lot of very sexual stuff very risque i bet you the guy  did something wrong she wins whatever the exchange is she wins it right right it's gonna be some 
[02:37:00]  belittling yeah some belittling will go on and some uh a little confusion drama with uh between the  couple but then it just gets funny it's gonna be fun and it gets funny is it gonna be a twist  uh yes yeah turns out like they think it's gonna be like a fun date but it turns out he's known as  the hammer rapist and what he does is he goes out with girls and then as he's branding them with  the hammer claw he rapes their heinies with a stick why can't we have some crazy stupid love 
[02:37:30]  right there that's because she suspected who he was but and then she went out with him anyway and  that's why it's called crazy stupid love because she was crazy and her friends were all like look i  think it's him he has a hammer in his pocket yeah you're stupid and love because he loves doing it  loves caving in broads heads yeah but only with the claw end in the back  all the fingers are honey with a stick all right let's start it up let's see if uh some of these  elements are in there 25 years of marriage and you have nothing to say i'll just say it i slept with 
[02:38:00]  someone if you keep talking i'm gonna get out of the car i think the fact that i did it it just shows  how broken we are how much how much really oh my god you're getting a divorce yeah amy heard you  crying in the bathroom we all thought it was cancer oh thank god man yeah that's my relationship  oh hi can i buy you a drink let's get out of here want to get out of here what are you doing later  i don't know i do there's lots of beautiful women in this bar but i can't take my eyes off of you 
[02:38:30]  it's time to go home oh it's forward of you but okay should i pull the car around have you been  drinking i'll drive hey ladies man guy any tips of the trade your wife cheated on you because you  lost sight of who you are as a man voiceover guy just take that straw out of your mouth it looks like  you're sucking on it okay should i have that one dick in the trailer i guess you're sitting there  with a supercuts haircut and you're wearing a 44 and you should be wearing a 42 regular credit card  where are your wallets would you sleep with me jeez god yeah probably you would you got to take 
[02:39:00]  control of your manhood pal can you put on some clothes please oh i'm sorry is he bothering you  beautiful  what do you want to do with me i want to show you off to my ex-wife and make her really jealous  oh man marissa tell me and she is a game changer she's your soulmate right go get her back 
[02:39:30]  how old are you i'm in love with her and i don't know what to do about it  oh it's the serious dramatic part where the comedy when you and i stopped being us  you know when i told you that i had to work late i really went to see the new twilight movie by myself  and it was so bad  and they show you the whole movie they get back together at the end they show you the whole movie 
[02:40:00]  i got chills i don't i don't hate this as much as i thought i would it looks awful but they show  her running back to him it's like yeah they're showing you the whole movie trailer people literally  should be lined up and shot through the temple summarily executed yes there are some twists that  they didn't show either you've seen this i saw it okay okay tell us what happens did you go with  jess she yes she made you go yeah yeah no guy has to go to a movie did you sit there like as the 
[02:40:30]  credits are rolling like not not the end credits like at the beginning when it first starts were  you just like oh christ i gotta fucking sit through this yeah but then at the end i appreciated the  happy ending and thought it was sweet shut up you they got together well i'm not going to explain  what happens in the ending the happy ending they both there was a fire and they both got trapped  in it okay did you like the movie sam it's a nice movie i mean i don't think a bunch of dudes are  gonna go see it yeah it's a nice movie though a nice it's a nice movie it's a nice movie and it's 
[02:41:00]  not quite as uh as typical as many of the movies that we've described on this show somewhat typical  sure but not quite as i hate goofy sex like that though like um what do you want to do with me  what shit does that and then she jumps on  why do you have to take the sexuality out of fucking so what do you want to do  nobody does that you're drinking with her you start kissing her neck and you try to get her to 
[02:41:30]  fucking blow you that's what you do you can pound that veal exactly with a really weird and bright  light shining on you i don't get why they have to take the sexuality out of all fucking said that  twice i don't uh i i shan oh no of course it doesn't look as bad as i thought it would though  we got two a-listers coming this week so i gotta go see uh change up today tonight you're going too  jimmy i don't know i'm tired how's that oh fucking roland said you're going so i said if jimmy 
[02:42:00]  goes i'm going i might roland's a good date though yeah we've seen a lot of movies together  where is it where is it you know our hood oh is it up on the uh it's at the thing maybe i would  then let's go 6 30 at the thing that's a weird time though 6 30 it's right before i gotta go do a  spot if it was like one o'clock it'd be easier that i could nap just get a spot remover or something  if i had one my dog just disappeared  it's kind of funny it's not mine though if these assholes don't have sex after they change 
[02:42:30]  roles right i'm done well then just lean over and punch roland i'll be so fucking pissed  what if it's just a good movie though who gives a fuck i'm sick of morality in hollywood i've said  a million fucking times i'm sick of it i'm sick that the comedies have to have a message i'm sick  all the bullshit just fucking entertain me if you're gonna have a married guy now be single  because they there's some hocus pocus that happened that's not believable you're not gonna pee in the 
[02:43:00]  fountain and then change roles with a guy so so you have to believe that but then you then they don't  have sex with the uh you know when they change roles they're significant others because that's  just wrong yeah that's but it's it's a movie who gives a fuck what's wrong yeah they gotta start  having sex with the people you think that'll happen like they're good friends one single one's  married so then the single guy becomes the married guy so as the married guy is he banging the the  wife there and as the married guy who's now the single guy is he getting all the fucking pussy that 
[02:43:30]  the single guy was gonna get well that's what annoyed the shit out of me during those movies like  that lindsey lohan one when she was a kid and switch places with a freaky friday switch plays  with a mother right like she should have been fucking her dad yes and you go yes you're preaching  to the choir imagine the fucking the girl the daughter is in the mother's body and she's got  to take a fucking ass ass fucking from from dear old dad it's hollywood why not because that's 
[02:44:00]  they're they're uh basically saying that's what's happening but they don't they don't really show how  about the wife realizes what's been going on for the past few years in the daughter's bedroom  yeah dad comes in oh hi sweetie she's like wait a minute i'm the wife here in the body you're not  fat like your mother your pussy isn't loose like your mother all they do is bad mouth the mother  name one switcheroo movie that that worked crying game face off great vice versa what what is that one 
[02:44:30]  with uh vice versa fred savage savage yeah and the other guy from fucking beverly hills cop i thought  it was a poem about vice grips so what happens in vice versa the dad and the son switch places  all right so there's the son the gimmick is the son getting mad pussy yes from mom no no but there  there is an awkward date between the dad but the son it's actually the son in the dad's body 
[02:45:00]  and the dad's girlfriend hey big he gets laid he does that he does robert loger rapes him on the  piano he's fucking him on those big big piano keys yeah the uh yeah the the the chick for that he  gets at work gets uh with her he winds up fucking her there you go and he's all i want there you go  he's just kidding the guy's body but he got laid it fucks him up too yeah he comes into work he's all 
[02:45:30]  happy yeah he don't know what's what's so why did they stop doing that obviously hollywood used to  allow the sex thing to happen after the switcheroo yeah same reason they stopped fucking they wouldn't  let walter matt the the uh billy bob hold a beer oh my god oh yes bad news bears the remake they uh  drove me nuts what were they drinking soda or something but that's why i don't go to the movies  they're all bears but kids just hanging around drinking beers and was that was hilarious and  bomb there was fucking all it was great walter matthew's driving in a car no seatbelts drinking 
[02:46:00]  a beer himself and the kids are drinking a beer right kids in the car yeah just drinking he's  drinking and driving at watching that as a kid i was just like this i wasn't like wow look he's  drinking a beer that was like that's my life but we all understand it's wrong we really do in general  that's what the comedy is then they remake the fucking uh movie and they they cut that out  they take all the uh just don't make the fucking things out of it yeah they ruined it they ruined  that franchise because i bet you they wanted to make a bunch oh they probably wanted to do the 
[02:46:30]  whole thing yeah four of them hall pass if if comedy is comfortable and conforms to what people  are comfortable it's kind of silly exactly funny you're 100 right mike in new york mikey  yo guys how you doing hey hall pass what was hall pass again i forget owen wilson owen wilson  the wives give them the chance to go out and have a free week of uh no marriage  all right oh the boys get to go out because the lady said so yeah how fucking awful they're giving 
[02:47:00]  us a pass right but the premise is awesome for hollywood you know the wife says you got a free  pass so why not just show this guy fucking losing his mind well he's got because deep down  he knows he loves his wife oh steve merchant promoted that did he uh did he produce it or direct  it maybe it's funny if he is involved with it oh i think he might be in it and what at the end of  the movie he had a chance and he still said no mike the whole movie he owen wilson is after the hottest 
[02:47:30]  chick ever she basically gets in the bedroom with him takes her top off which was the best part of  the movie and she's ready to fuck him and he just has this moral attitude to it i screamed at my  conundrum thank you for noticing it drives me nuts it really does it's like just fucking do it it's a  it's a stupid movie in the end how about a comedy where the guy's just sticking his dick in we've got  to be likable we think we gotta make him likable how do you make him likable who's gonna like 
[02:48:00]  this person it didn't test well it didn't test well because he's not very likable we like likable  hey uh mikey thank you brother there's another one coming in now we're all over the place but this  is good tj and jersey go ahead sir listen to this one hello if you watch the movie pearl harbor that  that train wreck of a movie that one person smoked a cigarette in the entire movie that's all they 
[02:48:30]  did back then all they did that's all they did the kids were smoking waiting for dad to come home  they killed japs and smoked that's all they did yeah take it easy guys why why are you changing history  oh they love doing that no i know that but why uh let's go to andy in pittsburgh gotta be likable and nice  hey guys bad news bears canter boyle sums up the talent on the team and he says we have two jews  a nigger and a speck and a wop who throws air balls you would never hear that but that but

Why don't you marry it?  Why don't you marry it?  I hate the didgeridoo.  Not a fan.  I don't like aborigines. 
[03:10:00]  They're scary looking.  They all look the same.  It's a frightening thing going on there.  How do you know if you're listening to a good didgeridoo?  Oh, you're tapping your foot like crazy.  Because you can't hear it.  Didgeridoo.  Yeah, how do you know if it's a good didgeridoo player?  He's just going.  I'll tell you how you know.  If you think it's a didgeridoo and then a blast comes out of it and the guy shoots himself.  You're like, wow, I thought that was a didgeridoo.  A didgeridoo with a toe trigger.  Yes, exactly. 
[03:10:30]  But he was killing himself with his didgeridoo.  Shot him.  Yeah, they're crazy, those aborigines.  Fuck yeah, they are.  Man.  Stupid criminal on Judge Judy.  Judge Judy.  Judge Judy.  I say everybody is guilty of not having Grommanier.  You missed the old broad?  That's different, Judy.  No.  You don't miss her?  I know you don't miss her.  I know you don't miss your old life, but those were some fun times of how crazy she was. 
[03:11:00]  It was kind of fun, but it got pretty annoying.  I got to be honest with you.  I remember the good fun parts, but I also do remember that I was most of the time a very unhappy young man going through that.  Young boy.  You were.  It was many years ago.  You were a young boy.  Yeah, I was a young boy.  My 30s.  My favorite Judy story was when she drove us to the airport.  We've told it many times, but we haven't told it in a while. 
[03:11:30]  We just moved to Boston, or the Boston area, so we didn't know the lay of the land, and it took, how long did it take to get to Logan Airport?  Be honest.  From Framingham to Logan, it had to be two hours.  Two hours.  Yeah.  And we're like, fuck, I thought we were close to Boston.  And it wasn't, you know, traffic or anything like that.  No, she was on all these weird back roads and stuff.  We're thinking she knows a shortcut.  Yeah, yeah.  She didn't go down, what was it, Route 9 was the main one?  She didn't go down anything. 
[03:12:00]  She went down, like, side streets the whole fucking way.  She managed to take back roads and side streets.  We were constantly in housing developments and never on a highway.  Farmlands, whatever.  She's like, I don't like going on the highways, and I don't make left-hand tunes, so I always make three rights, because that's the left.  And I can't drive on the highways, because I don't like getting on an on-ramp.  And I'm like, why?  This is a long-ass drive, man. 
[03:12:30]  And then we're up there for a while and realize, holy shit, where we were only 20 minutes from the airport.  Yeah.  Yeah, one day I had to drive myself, like, from Framingham to the airport.  And I got there, and I was like, what the fuck?  Is this the same airport?  What the fuck took her so long?  All right, I'm going to challenge you.  So here's the light.  Okay.  See, I made three.  Oh, right.  All right, here's your car, right?  Yeah.  So you want to make a left.  I've never done the equation.  So three rights. 
[03:13:00]  So this would be one right.  So now you're heading this way.  Yeah.  Right?  This would be your second right.  Right.  Third right.  You would be going left.  You're going left.  I never did the actual equation.  Yeah.  Because I always thought, yeah, you're going left, but you're not going left on the road  you could have just went on if you took the left at the light.  See what you have?  But you're at least going parallel left if you make three rights.  But here's what you have to do.  You've got to go past the left turn you want to make.  You go one street past it, and then you do your right, right, right, and now it's like 
[03:13:30]  you had made a left on the street you wanted to make a left on.  So you've got to go past it one block.  Wait, so.  Go three or light.  Where am I going in this equation?  Go through the light.  No, you can't go through the light.  Go straight through it.  All right.  Then what?  And now make a right.  A right.  And a right.  Right, right, right.  And now you're right there.  Exactly.  Now you're exactly where you're going.  Now you're driving like Judy.  And we did a million of those.  Oh, God. 
[03:14:00]  Damn.  Take it.  Fuck.  I miss the old bag.  Ah, you know, funny old broad.  I must say.  She was all right.  But there were some times.  Wow.  That I want to go home night.  We're just starting to have fun.  Having some beverages.  Hanging out.  I want to go home.  Fuck.  Fuck.  It's 930.  We're in the fucking North End, and I got to drive back to Ashland.  Can't you control your booze?  It's 930. 
[03:14:30]  Come on, pace yourself.  Really?  Jesus.  You bat.  When did you start drinking?  7 in the morning?  It's like, what the fuck?  Turn it off.  That guy's shoes.  Oh, my fucking God.  Oh, did you see his shoes?  Whose shoes?  The guy with the...  They look like the back of one of Dice's jackets.  Really?  Are they bedazzled?  Yes.  He's wearing bedazzled shoes.  I had to piss badly.  Which shoe?  Which guy?  They always say you can't judge a book by its cover.  You can.  Especially if it's two back covers.  Take out the striped wife, Peter.  Two back covers. 
[03:15:00]  Sam, open the door.  I want to just yell, nice shoes.  No, no.  And I can do it.  Why?  Because there's going to be a harassment deal.  How is it a harassment?  It's harassing.  I don't know where you get shoes like that.  It's harassing.  Hubie's making fun of my fucking femininity.  Something.  You know how this place is.  You know how this place works.  If I blow this...  If I want to be involved in a blowing up of this shit,  I want it to be on a grand scale.  Not because some Femi guy has wacky shoes.  Well, you just said more than I did. 
[03:15:30]  I said it.  Now you're in more trouble than me.  He's Femi.  So as soon as your studio's built,  then you're going for the big out?  Yeah, yeah.  Then I'll just, you know...  And you'll do the big out?  As soon as it's built.  I'll come in drunk.  Fucking...  It's built.  More impressive than this place.  It's crazy.  I'm watching the guy right now  bring in all the last light racks for the back.  It's almost more impressive than this studio.  It's crazy.  Because it's not just audio.  That's kind of driving you nuts  when you go home and know what it could be. 
[03:16:00]  I know.  It does.  I was pulling wire all weekend  like an old school,  like I was working.  I had to go to Home Depot  and get some tools that I didn't have.  Wire pullers and fucking,  you know, the cable thing  that you thread through the fucking  holes in the floor  to pull wires out.  But now there's no wires.  You can't see fucking wires.  It's all under the table.  So why can't they fix the lights in here?  I'm not...  It's not my job.  No, I'm just saying why can't they?  They could.  Absolutely could.  They say they can't.  They abso-fucking-lutely could.  Too much work involved. 
[03:16:30]  Too much shit.  Can't you just change out the light bulbs even  and get softer light bulbs?  You could.  Or they do have filters on the front  so I don't know what they're talking about.  See these black snap-on things?  Those are filters.  Those are filters.  Those could be taken out  and different filters can be put in.  But they said,  no, there's nothing that can go in front of here.  It can.  Didn't they even...  Stupid.  Think of just changing the light bulbs?  Yeah, or how about maybe lower wattage?  You know you get that soft lighting in your bathroom.  It's nice.  Why can't they do it in here?  That's all.  Because they're dolts. 
[03:17:00]  They're dolts.  Bad mood.  Oh, how long?  Oh, it's...  Uh-oh.  It's like first and goal bad mood, though.  Well, no, this is...  You gotta...  If you want to save me from a bad mood,  we should end the show now.  And then I won't be in a bad mood.  That was Laszlo doing it.  And that's without the right lighting and everything still.  I can wane into the key.  It's amazing.  If you dump that beer in there.  Maybe we should take a phone call.  Now all of a sudden you find out 
[03:17:30]  to take a television break.  What?  Laszlo.  So they're out there trying to figure out the technology  so that Wayne can do live karaoke.  You gotta tweak it myself a little bit.  You gotta tweak it myself a little bit.  Yeah, I got...  That's worth 200 bucks.  I don't have the lighting up yet.  That's the problem.  I didn't have the rear lighting up.  Is he done?  But I have it all now.  It's going in as we speak.  I just saw the guy bring the...  Dude, looking at my security cameras,  I just saw the guy bring the rack in.  He's talked about getting blown by a prostitute.  Your mics are amazing,  but they need to be tweaked a little bit.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  Everything's gotta be...  That was the first actual broadcast  that was really done over it.  I gotta...  Yeah, I gotta pump up the processing on it.  Maybe a little lower end.  They're a little too tweaky,  a little too high-end.  Or it's just Laszlo's voice.  Maybe Laszlo talks like that.  Yeah.  He's a girl.  Laszlo is?  Yeah.  He's a girl.  He'll be the first to admit it.  He knows.  We had a pisser,  and Wayne doing karaoke was funny.  He became addicted to karaoke.  He did, like, one song, 
[03:18:30]  and then he's like,  I'm just gonna keep doing this.  This is great.  And he stayed for hours singing karaoke.  Do you ever kick anyone out of your house?  No.  I don't.  No, I don't think I've...  Just...  Unless you steal something.  And actually,  I didn't even kick him out.  He fled.  He ran away.  Yeah.  Where are you gonna go?  Where are you gonna go?  I thought we were gonna get out of here  like four minutes early.  Yeah, we should.  Why don't we?  Can I plug Utah?  No. 
[03:19:00]  You can.  I want my shit.  But could you?  You could, but...  August 19th, 20th.  August 19th, 20th where?  Utah Wise Guys Comedy Club.  It's actually...  Meh.  ...selling fairly well.  Yeah.  Uh, so far.  What's that?  I don't know.  I'm doing...  The Kings of Leon thing.  Oh, that's them fucking...  Caleb Followell or whatever.  However you say his last name.  Getting sick.

I hope your comeback is like  complete Mormon.  Yeah.  You just believe in it  with all your passion and...  Or you say turn it off a lot.  Oh.  You don't think you'd rather be with a man.  Turn it off.  I need tickets to that.  Dude, it's fucking great.  We have four of them coming in. 
[03:20:00]  I'll go, Jimmy, how is Utah?  And you'll be like...  If you ever think...  It's the fucking...  Wait, let me see if...  Oh.  Because everybody wants to know  why we do that.  Hold on.  Oh, you got a little tune on there, do you?  Wait.  I don't want to give anything away.  I love your iPhone volume.  It's great.  Oh, don't get us started with that. 
[03:20:30]  Hold on.  And then he'd try and...  Whoa, turn it off.  Like a light switch there, it's gone.  Good for you.  My heterocyte just won.  I'm all better now.  Boys should be with girls.  That's Heavenly Father's plan.  So if you ever feel you'd rather be with a man,  turn it off.  Turn it off.  And he does a little thing across the neck. 
[03:21:00]  It's so fucking great.  This fucking...  This absolute homosexual fighting it.  It's fucking really great.  I gotta see that.  Dude, it sounds great.

Another week's worth of Opie and Anthony shows here on the virus.  I just had to...  I mean, Opie and Anthony are obviously gone.  You know this by now.  They were out the door at 10 o'clock. 
[03:24:00]  There is nobody telling them which way to go this time, though.  So we can only assume that they weren't able to avoid management.  Eric, do you have any idea who's been tipping them off as to which way to walk to avoid management?  No, I sit here usually on the board or I'm in the back cutting up stuff for 10 o'clock.  So I'm never around this area.  Because Roland took credit for the game on Friday of should you go this way or that way?  But he didn't.  But Opie said that there is somebody tipping him off as to which direction they are in so he can walk the opposite. 
[03:24:30]  Wouldn't...  And maybe this is just me being naive.  Wouldn't more get done if they just spoke to management every now and then?  Or is that not right?  Well, after based on something that Opie said earlier, I think he's trying not to talk to them at all.  At all?  Okay.  Or some of them, at least.  That's not fair to say all of them.  But maybe some of them.  I'm trying not to talk to the Ron and Fez interns at all. 
[03:25:00]  Because before we went on the air, I had a 10-minute conversation about who Sandra Bernhardt is with this intern.  He kept trying to explain to me who Sandra Bernhardt was.  And I had to keep explaining.  I know who Sandra Bernhardt is.  I've been around the block once or twice.  She was married to Jesse James, right?  No, that's Sandra Butluck.  Oh, sorry.  No.  And Mars...  Is that Mars' voice I just heard?  Yeah, he just asked if I was serious.  No, Mars.  He's joking. 
[03:25:30]  Mars, though, he is...  Mars is a little gullible.  Because Opie, earlier today, Opie was saying there's something wrong with the mics.  And then he was rubbing his hand on the mic.  And you better believe your bottom dollar that Mars was in here checking mics during the commercial break.  Mars, did you know that he was pulling your leg?  Um, you could hear it because it makes a certain sound like this.  Like that.  Like that.  But I...  I hate the way it feels.  But I wasn't sure, you know, because I, you know, hey, you gotta, you know, take his word for it. 
[03:26:00]  I mean, I know.  And you, if you had just said, oh, he's fucking around again and not checked on it,  and it was actually something wrong, you would have been in a lot of trouble.  Uh, I think so.  And justifiably, so I guess you did the right thing.  There is a lot of people outside the studio right now.  Yeah, there's just some big party going over on an out queue there.  There's a lot of people.  There's a party?  Well, there's a lot of people.  They might as well.  They're very, uh, festively dressed. 
[03:26:30]  What does that mean, Eric?  Very, uh, vibrant colors.  Tight?  Tight.  Studs.  Studs.  Are there studs?  Bizzazz.  What is it?  Bizzazzled.  No, no.  Eric, why would you correct him?  Sorry.  He said, Bizzazzled.  You let, when Mars says something incorrectly, you let him say, he just said, Bizzazzled.  Is this all Young and the Restless people?  Oh, is that what that is? 
[03:27:00]  I, well, that one, there's one girl who we saw go in there from the Young and the Restless,  but, I know, I don't know.  It's just such a big deal being made out of this.  I feel like we should at least be aware, if not invited, to what's going on.  Do you know what I mean?  Eric, do you know anything about the party itself?  Um, I don't know.  There's a lot of people.  I'm making sure, um, our radio feed is off in the hallway.  It should be.  Um, I see the levels, but I'm just making sure.  I'm a Fez intern.  Hang on, and then I'll tell you.  Okay, Mars is going outside. 
[03:27:30]  Hopefully he'll tell me.  Uh, I guess.  Ooh, no, it looked like it was up.  We're waiting.  He's coming.  Why wouldn't he just come in the studio, this Marcelino character?  Go in the studio.  Yeah, I want to know what, what happened.  Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, the door's open.  We can't say anything.  Okay, it's shut.  It was very low.  It was on?  Oh, let me, uh, it was on though?  It was very low.  Why was it on at all?  I don't know.  I saw the levels moving.  I'm not blaming you.  I'm not blaming you, Mars.  You want me to cut that signal off of that? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, because Jim's complained about it a bunch of times.  Okay.  Not today, but like, in the past.  I'll cut it off now.  Yeah, because what good can come of it, really?  Yeah.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  The one guy that went into our queue looked like Hugh Jackman, was 90, still wearing  the Wolverine makeup.  What do you mean?  He looked like Wolverine?  He looked like Wolverine, but very, very aged.  Oh, like an old Wolverine?  Yeah, like an old Wolverine.  I want to see this guy.  With a yellow, pink, and light green shirt under a blazer. 
[03:28:30]  Did he have hair like that, too?  Yeah, sort of.  If you look at him, you can go, yeah, old gay Wolverine.  Oh, you think he's gay?  All right, no, I can't make assumptions.  I'll take that back, but older-looking Wolverine.  Pips the Ron and Fez intern, you saw him?  Because I see you nodding.  Well, I just maybe heard some voice, you know, talking a little bit.  Effeminate?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little effeminate?  Where are you from?  Sheeps Bay, Brooklyn.  Nice.  So you're not afraid to knock a couple heads?  No, not at all.  I love that. 
[03:29:00]  I would have guessed Long Island, but Brooklyn it is.  Eric, a lot of stuff went on on this Monday, Opie and Anthony.  I would love to know why that thing was on in the hallway.  Who could it have possibly been on for?  We didn't have any guests.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, do you have any idea why?  It could have been a Friday thing.  Like it was just left on?  Yeah.  No one removes it.  Yeah, because why would you turn it down if you're not, well, we got to keep an eye  on that, Eric. 
[03:29:30]  Somebody.  I guess we don't have people, and we don't have interns, so they're not in that hallway  that much, but somebody's got to because I was just claiming that that guy in the tank  top was looking at Ant the whole show.  But I strongly believe they weren't listening.  I hope not.  It was down really low, really low.  Like you would have to make a specific effort, put your ear up to it?  That low, yes.  Okay, all right.  By the way, the guy in the tank top with the rolled up denim shorts is the one that  has the bedazzled shoes.  Bizzazzled, you mean? 
[03:30:00]  Bizzazzled shoes.  Yeah, I saw them.  You like his shoes?  Yeah, Mars kept staring at him.  Okay, go ahead.  Mars kept staring at him.  You looked at the shoes, Mars?  Not as colorful as I would like them to be, though.  What is it like them to be?  Go tell him what he's doing wrong.  You talked about, previously on the show, the amount of child touching that goes on in  Hispanic families, correct?  Yes.  You've spoken on that.  What is the Hispanic view of gay children in the family? 
[03:30:30]  Like if a child comes to you and says, Dad, Papi, I'm gay.  Yo soy gay.  You know, something like that.  You know, I don't know.  Do you hang them like a piñata?  They have a lot of gay people in that culture, so they have to be accepting.  But are all those kids, like, disowned by their parents and they have to go out on their  own?  No, I don't think so.  Are the parents okay with it?  I guess, you know, they have a, initially they have a problem, especially with the father 
[03:31:00]  if he wants to be so macho, but they get over that.  I've seen that.  They get over it.  Because I knew of one, I knew of one kid who, a Hispanic kid, who was like the gayest  kid ever.  Because a lot of, I'll tell you this, a lot of Hispanic gay people really take on those  stereotypes.  You think so?  Like they get very flamboyant.  They go overboard just a little bit?  Yes, I've seen it happen.  And this was one of those kids.  This was in high school.  And he was just like, obviously like, even before he came out, like in 10th grade when 
[03:31:30]  he had a girlfriend, everybody made fun of the girl.  Like, what are you doing?  Like, we all know where this is leading.  And so he eventually came out, and he was like the gay kid.  Like, he was the gayest kid ever.  And his family actually sent him away to one of those church, revival, turn you straight  type of camps.  How did that work out?  He came back and he said he was straight.  I mean...  Are you serious?  Yeah.  He said, I mean, he was still the same guy I knew. 
[03:32:00]  Did he act straight?  Like, I kind of, but he's lying, you know?  Like, he's just doing what he was told.  Because, I don't know, his parents must have made him go.  He didn't go voluntarily, that's for sure, because he disappeared.  But that's not a Hispanic thing that's isolated to that family, in your experience.  Yeah, and also, we grew up with them.  I mean, there was one in our family circle called Wonder Woman.  And he was an uncle?  No, he was extended, like, you know, a friend of the family.  Gotcha.  But he was totally accepted. 
[03:32:30]  Wonder Woman?  Wonder Woman.  When Wonder Woman would bitch, we would listen, you know?  We would take care of Wonder Woman as much as we can.  And if somebody's picking out Wonder Woman, you had his back.  Right, but I was too young.  But what I did notice is that the adults were always very cool with Wonder Woman.  And I wondered why.  Well, that's a good lesson for the kids.  Well, a lot of times, the guys that were cool with him were straight guys.  That's good.  So it was like, you know, a little, like, what's going on?  Why are they so friendly with him?  Come to find out after they get older, the motherfucker was dealing drugs. 
[03:33:00]  Okay, well, that makes sense then.  That's why I love Wonder Woman.  That's the way Wonder Woman can survive in the culture.  I guess.  Start dealing drugs.  That's one way to do it.  I'm not saying that's the only way to do it, but that's hilarious.  Wonder Woman was just a gay drug dealer running around town.  But you're right.  They're very flamboyant.  The Hispanics that are, I want to be politically correct.  Sure.  Gay.  That are gay.  But Hispanic people are also very cultural people.  Like, you take your culture and traditions very seriously, I feel like. 
[03:33:30]  So maybe when they say, okay, I'm gay, like, when they realize it and say, I'm out of the  closet, they're going to take on, because they're just such a cultural people, they're  going to take on all that culture, too.  Maybe.  I'm theorizing here.  I guess.  Eric, do you have any ideas on this?  No.  I know you, I mean.  He has a Hispanic in his family, too, right?  You tell me all the time.  You do?  The lawyer. 
[03:34:00]  Or married to the lawyer?  Married to the lawyer.  Down in Florida?  What, you said she was a Hispanic?  Do you have any Hispanic people in your family?  Not at, well, I guess technically, but not really anymore.  Okay.  What is it?  I had an aunt that my aunt.  Through marriage, but divorce?  No.  Through marriage, but my uncle had died.  Jesus.  So she kind of, once he died, she kind of distanced herself from the rest of the family.  Oh, so she was through marriage, but then that marriage connection died, so she was like,  I'm not an angle anymore. 
[03:34:30]  She just kind of went off a little bit.  They kicked her out the fucking house.  Did you?  We don't want you around here anymore.  No.  Let's purify.  But she's Puerto Rican.  I'm trying to think of her.  I don't have any lawyers.  Well, I'm sorry.  I thought you said she was a lawyer.  My bad.  No, I had the doctor, but I have Greek in my family.  I don't have much Hispanic in my family.  Now he's talking about Greek.  I was trying to figure out what Mars was talking about.  He's just trying to let you know that, you know, his family is not, you know, all that 
[03:35:00]  lily-white type.  Oh, what, Greek isn't lily-white?  It's diverse?  Well, you know, they are from Greece.  They're not Americans, right?  Yeah.  So there is a difference.  Greek is married into my family.  Greek is, so the most diverse is that Greek is married.  What are you talking about, Mars?  Mars, were you excited to hear Jim bring up the Fedor fight?  I was a little busy at that time, but I don't know exactly what was heard, but during break, 
[03:35:30]  he did say it was a good stoppage.  Yeah.  At first, I thought he said it wasn't, and that had me going.  I was like, no.  Because you thought it was a good stoppage.  Are you kidding me?  That was a good stoppage.  According to the rules given to Herb Dean, that was-  That's the referee.  Right.  That was the correct stoppage.  And one of the callers called up and said it was a good fight, to which Jim said it wasn't  a good fight.  It was exciting.  It was a good, you know, something happened to talk about, but it wasn't like a good fight.  It was one round.  Right.  Now, a good fight to a regular participant, he just wants to see violence. 
[03:36:00]  Right.  And that's exactly what happened.  Right.  We don't even have a ding, ding bell.  They just say fight.  And he came out, guns a-blazing.  Mm-hmm.  And it was pretty wild.  It was a street brawl.  Right.  That's what it was.  It was, you can't say it was a good fight because it technically, it wasn't a good fight.  It didn't show like-  No skills.  There was no training, there was no skill, there was no strategy.  It was like, I'm going to knock your head off.  And Dan said, oh, no, you won't.  I'm going to knock your head off.  And that's what happened.  Well, we want it in honor. 
[03:36:30]  Do you think Fedor is going to come back or is he done?  Like, not to say he's going to retire, but do you think the Fedor of a couple years ago that was just dominating, is he done?  That Fedor, I think, is done.  Yeah.  But Fedor himself is not done.  He still has a lot of fight in him.  He just, let me say, Dan Henderson is no fucking joke.  You guys want a tough white boy?  There you go.  But isn't this what happened to Chuck Liddell?  Like, he was dominant for a while and then he just started losing fights. 
[03:37:00]  And you just, like, I guess that's what happens to fighters.  Like, what happens is that people start seeing you, they see a vulnerability in you.  Yeah.  And you can get beat.  So that's a little, you know, it's in the game and the head's in the game, too.  So mentally, I could say, no, I could beat you.  There's a possibility that I can beat you.  I've seen it happen.  Now, if he's killing everybody, then it's like, damn, I got to fight him.  Well, I'll tell you this.  I mean, we may say that Fedor is not as dominant.  Fedor Emelianenko is not as dominant as he was in the cage before.  But when he was in here, he was as dominant as anyone ever was. 
[03:37:30]  But then again, that was about two, three years ago.  No, no, no, no, no.  The last time he was in here?  Oh, the very last time.  When he was in this studio.  It was February of this year.  February of this year.  And he came in and he was just the same guy you don't want to fuck with that he was a couple years ago.  Don't get it twisted, man.  Not everybody could take a shot like Dan Henderson took.  This guy got rocked.  Right.  We're going past the point there.  Henderson actually got rocked, put on his back, was getting pummeled. 
[03:38:00]  But he just has that fucking, you know, hard jaw.  He knows he's a fighter and he turned it around.  And he's not afraid of Fedor.  Right.  He wasn't afraid of him.  Trust me.  If that punch would have just skinned me, not hit me, skinned me, the wind alone would have knocked me into a coma.  Yeah.  Any of us would be out.  Our jaws would be shattered.  And it's interesting about Fedor because Jim, when fighters come in, Norton always has them put him in a move like Rashad Evans was just in. 
[03:38:30]  Obi put the video up on Obi Radio, his YouTube channel.  He choked him out.  And every fighter comes in.  The UFC guys, they put him in like very light versions of these moves.  Anderson Silva actually kicked him, which was the first like shot he took.  But every time, very light versions.  And as soon as Jim taps, they release him because it's all in good fun.  He said Fedor was the only guy that just kept it on a little longer.  Just to, just to, oh, no, I, if I left, like, I don't have to let this go and I could really hurt you. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  It's, it goes back to a cultural thing.  I think the Ruskies are a little, little less forgiving than we are.  They're not a, they're not a jovial people.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  They're a little tougher.  So we want to, in honor of, uh, of the fight that just happened over the weekend and everything we talked about on the show today, we figured that we would relive, uh, Jim.  Eric, do you remember what move, or Mars, if you do, what move?  It was two different moves that he did. 
[03:39:30]  Uh, one might be the rear naked choke, and I forgot what the second one is.  Isn't there something to his arm, or am I wrong?  Perhaps, but with all due respect, they're not called moves, they're called submission holds.  They're moves.  So let's, let's keep it as submission holds.  It's a move.  This isn't any fucking wrestling fake shit.  This is for real.  It's a move.  In regular wrestling, it's called a move, isn't it?  So in, in MMA, it's called submission hold.  What if it's not submissions?  No.  Then it's a knockout, or a technical knockout.  What if it's a leg knock?  Or a technique. 
[03:40:00]  What if it's a takedown?  We call it technique.  It's all moves.  Never a move.  What move is that?  Oh, a takedown.  A double leg.  Oh, that's a good move.  No.  Yeah, always moves.  What about suplexes?  You guys do suplexes?  As a matter of fact.  Yeah.  Fedor, uh, he survived one from Kendall Randleman.  A suplex?  Oh my God.  Belly to back?  Belly to back.  That's where the suplex is?  German suplex.  Yes, he, he jumped off his feet, Randleman, jumped off his fucking feet and put him right  on his neck. 
[03:40:30]  Wow.  Fedor turned around and submitted him.  That's incredible.  And that's a move though.  The suplex is a move.  It's a technique.  Anyone get a pile driver?  That would be a technique as well.  Figure four leg law.  That's a submission, O.  Which one?  Figure four leg law.  That's a submission.  What about a gorilla press?  Ultimate warrior style?  What is that?  It's when you pick a guy up over your head and you pump him up and down and then you throw  him.  What's the one that the iron sheep does?  The camel clutch.  Now, isn't that like a Boston crab? 
[03:41:00]  It's like a Boston crab is when a guy is on his stomach and then you go, you're sitting  on his back and you pick his legs up.  So you're stretching his back out.  A camel clutch is reversed.  He's still on his stomach, but you're picking him up by the chin and stretching him back.  I know we could talk about this for hours, especially you telling me all these wrestling  moves, but don't you have a bit to play?  See, he called them moves.  It doesn't work.  Because that's what he calls them.  Yeah, that's what we were calling them.  You can't interrupt my explanation to your question.  If you had had E-Rock ask the question, then your whole bit would have made sense, but 
[03:41:30]  because you asked the question, you set up your own bit.  Play the bit.  Eric, you saw what he did, right?  I saw.  It didn't work at all.  He's panicking.  He set up your own bit.  I'm not panicking.  All right.  In honor of Mars and all of you out there, this is Fedor and Jim.  Doing some moves.  Doing some moves.  Some MMA moves on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  We have fighters come in. 
[03:42:00]  We've had BJ Penn has done it.  Ken Velasquez and Randy Couture.  I have them put me in a move, a hold, nicely, just to see what it feels like to be in these  holds.  So I wanted to ask Fedor what hold he would put me in, but I will tap very quickly and  it's not for full force.  To show the technique and how it's done.  To show the technique.  Like, um, but I'm not a martial artist.  I know I look like one, but I'm not a martial artist. 
[03:42:30]  I love it if she messed up.  He accidentally ripped his head off.  Oh, I want him to.  Yeah, whatever.  I would love him to.  I just don't, uh, I don't know which one.  I'm actually trying to find the video.  Whichever one he would like to, because, uh, what he thinks would be a good one to put  me in, but, but not, how do you say very gentle?  How do you say gentle in Russian?  Mekka.  Mekka?  Okay.  Mekka.  There was not a happy man.  Yeah, some kind of a choke.  Okay, if you need something very gentle, I also can show you the armbar. 
[03:43:00]  Very gentle.  Ah, very gentle.  How do you do the armbar?  The one that BJ did?  Yeah, that's what he did.  Oh, the one that BJ did.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh!  Wow!  No!  Chop, chop!  Chop, chop!  What is chop, chop?  Chop, what does that mean?  He said, chop, chop!  What the fuck is chop, chop?  What the fuck is chop, chop? 
[03:43:30]  But he didn't even, he didn't even.  That didn't look like it was any pressure.  That didn't look like anything.  He didn't put any, like, on my neck or anything.  Jim got so nervous.  He thought he tried to speak Russian.  I meant to say tap, tap.  I didn't know what to say.  But I realized I wasn't tapping.  Hey, chop, chop, chop!  I hate to tell you, I didn't get it on film.  He did it way too fast.  I'm serious.  Oh, my God.  Chop, chop.  Can Fade want to do that again?  How about...  I didn't get it on film.  Well, Sam has a camera. 
[03:44:00]  I think Sam's on it.  Showtime guy.  No, Showtime guy.  I don't think he got it.  What's his favorite hold to put on somebody?  He's a strong guy.  Woof.  So, well, I love different hauls.  I, you know, I like submissions, you know, arm bars, you know, leg bars.  Well, I try to work in all sides, in different sides, in different directions.  There are some hauls, which you cannot use very often. 
[03:44:30]  You just don't have the situation, which is good for this very hold.  And if you manage to do that successfully, you'll feel really very happy.  Um, which I would like him to put me in one.  But I will tap very quickly.  Was this one not enough?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Hummel.  It was.  But Fade was my favorite fighter, so I don't get a chance. 
[03:45:00]  The other guys always had put me in one, but I'm like, there's nobody who would be scarier  for me to fight than Fade was.  So I would want him to put me in another one.  If you could just touch me one more time, please.  You asked for it, Jimmy.  Do it, Fade.  Teach him a lesson.  I'm a very bad boyfriend.  This is penance and punishment for my girlfriend, because I'm a lousy person.  I have no clue. 
[03:45:30]  A good choke, maybe?  A good choke?  Jesus.  What is this, Craigslist?  The look on your face when you're saying that is very disturbing.  It's very disturbing.  Okay.  What's Russian gentle?  Mягко.  Mягко.  Oh, he's a scary guy.  What's Russian for keep going?  Ow.  Is that his neck popping?  Is that his neck popping?  Did you hear that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, good boy.  Don't kill him.  Don't kill him. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, my God.  The other guys was great.  The other guys would, like, talk me and go, here we go.  He just grabbed me.  Ow.  Very strong.  Oh, we can sit back down.  That was lovely.  After ONA.  Live.  You betcha.  That Fedor was an animal.  There's Troy.  Let's bring Troy in here.  Why is he walking that way?  Bring him in here.  Eric, tell Troy to come in here.  Where's he going?  He's coming. 
[03:46:30]  What was he going to do over by you?  He didn't see you.  Oh.  What were you going to do?  I had to pull stuff from Pro Tools.  Oh, in that room?  Yeah.  Is Jim still here, or did he leave his sweatshirt?  I think he left.  He's done.  Oh.  Well, his sweatshirt's still here.  I'll put it aside for him.  Listen, Troy.  Yeah.  I got a...  You're the guy who knows what's going on in the conspiracy theory world.  Yeah.  That's you.  There's no bigger conspiracy over time than D.B. Cooper. 
[03:47:00]  Do you know what's going on with D.B. Cooper?  I don't know.  I really don't know too much about it.  Really?  No.  For a guy who likes conspiracy theories, you know, I've spent a lot of time reading about D.B.  Cooper.  And, you know, Eric, did you watch news radio?  Oh, the old NBC show?  Yeah.  Because I will tell you the first time that I ever heard of D.B. Cooper and I immediately  started researching him was when Jimmy James on news radio announced that he indeed was  D.B. Cooper.  Do you remember that episode? 
[03:47:30]  Not off the top of my head, no.  You gotta do your homework, Eric.  That is a great show.  Oh, the show's great.  I just don't remember that episode.  You don't know D.B. Cooper?  I'm not worried about that right now.  This girl just sent me a nude photo of herself.  What?  Let me see that.  Don't say what's going on.  Okay.  I'm gonna verify.  Oh my gosh.  She's nude.  I won't...  Obviously, there are some descriptives there that we don't want to...  Right.  Um...  You sure it's not from I Like Girls Daily on Twitter?  No.  Okay.  This was sent to you?  Yeah, like a minute ago.  Where did you meet her?  Can I see? 
[03:48:00]  Why are you back here, Mars?  Do you want Mars to see it or no?  Yeah, fuck it.  Go ahead.  Where did you...  Where...  Why is she sending you this picture?  Just to say what's up?  Yeah.  Well, I said...  She said, uh, I'm still in bed.  So, send me a picture.  So, she did.  Yeah, prove it.  I don't believe you, bitch.  Yeah.  Look at that, Mars.  But just don't...  Don't say what's going on.  Explain what's...  You know, the descriptive things.  She's going to get that colored in, right?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't want to do that.  See?  See?  You shouldn't have showed it to her. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, it's not good.  You're not seeing anything else.  What are you doing?  That's it.  You're done.  It could be a million people.  Yeah, you're done.  That's it.  That's it.  You're finished.  You're not cool.  Because I spoke about the coloring book?  Oh, shut the...  Mars, it never works when you try to do stuff.  It's not cool.  It's on.  Anyway, it doesn't work.  What were you saying?  I'm sorry, dude.  I got a little sidetracked.  You're talking about D.B. Cooper.  Oh, okay.  Because they think they may have...  I'm a little sidetracked, too.  Are there any more pictures like that that she sent you?  She sent me a PG one, but it's not as good.  Well, I wouldn't imagine so if it's PG. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, I asked for the...  I asked.  How many girls a week are you seeing right now?  I'm not.  I'm not really seeing any...  I'm seeing...  I don't know.  I've seen multiple nude photos from women on your phone.  Well, those are old.  No, they're not.  They're from their text messages.  Let's take a look at this one.  This is the early one.  Don't show marks.  Okay.  Hey, you know...  Oh, that's not that PG.  That's PG-13, my friend.  Hey, Sam.  I brought up the same thing this morning.  I like this right here.  The leg area?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah.  I brought up the same thing. 
[03:49:30]  You know old boy's getting laid big time.  Yeah, what are we...  What are we talking about?  I'm really not, dude.  Well, that's not true.  You're a single guy living in the city, you know...  Being a DJ at raves.  Yeah, yeah.  You DJ events.  You got all the tattoos.  You got your, you know, your hairstyle and everything.  And, you know, you're looking like you're swinging some cock around to tell you the truth.  Talk to me.  Talk to me, man.  I'm really not.  It's...  How many times per week...  Not by...  It could be by the same girl or different girl. 
[03:50:00]  How many times per week, on an average week, do you have intercourse?  One or less.  I really...  Honestly, I do not...  I do not have that much sex.  Do you believe that, Mars?  Nope.  Not at all.  No.  Why would I lie about that?  And by the way, once a week, that's a lot for a single guy.  Especially who's working a regular job.  I don't...  I just...  I don't have time to fuck around with it, dude.  I really don't.  Not according to your text messages.  I mean, this is just fucking playing around with some broad.  Having some fun.  Yeah, but I would assume there's been some sort of insertion.  Not with her? 
[03:50:30]  No.  No.  There will be.  No, no.  I just...  I literally just met her.  I'm sure there will be.  I don't...  I can't say that.  I don't know.  Probably not.  Probably not.  Why not?  Because you just...  You can't...  You can't have intercourse with everybody.  You just can't do it.  Everybody who sent you naked photos on text messages, I bet you could.  It's just for fun.  It's like, ah, whatever.  It's Monday.  Send me a picture.  You know?  I'm you nude.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean I'm going to have intercourse.  It just means, hey, it's Monday.  What's up?  Eric.  Yeah.  Have you had intercourse with everybody that's ever sent you nude pictures via text message? 
[03:51:00]  I really haven't had that.  Hey, Pips.  Yo.  Run a Fez intern.  This is a guy, you could tell.  Yeah.  Who gets around, okay?  He's a young guy.  Troy's getting nude text messages from women on a regular basis.  Okay.  No, not on a regular basis.  I've seen...  It just happened because...  And then I just happened to walk into the studio.  Well, he's claiming that a lot of times these women who send him naked pictures,  he doesn't penetrate them. 
[03:51:30]  Do you think that could possibly be true?  You know what?  I'm on Troy's side because this happened to me.  Oh, my God.  Girls who I meet...  Who do you know?  They...  It's messed up girls, man.  They send me naked pictures of themselves before anything even happens to entice me.  But some of these girls are a mess.  It's like, I don't want to see that shit, man.  Okay.  So you've already seen...  You're like, well, I'm not...  Yeah, that's gross.  I'm glad you showed that to me before.  Yeah.  Because I might have.  But the one you just showed me, I would recommend intercourse.  I mean, whatever.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  If it happens, it happens.  If it doesn't happen, I don't give a shit.  Is she in town or a different town? 
[03:52:00]  No, a different town.  Okay.  So that's why it wouldn't quite be so easy.  But, you know, you're a traveling guy.  Get your weekends free unless you're DJing.  Right.  In which case, there's other, you know, ladies to be had.  Yeah, it's just...  Honestly, it's a waste of time.  Broads are a waste of time.  What?  Based on what?  Well, I mean, it's...  Well, were you looking more at that guy in the tank top and the bizazzled shoes out there?  No, no, no.  Kind of where you're at?  It's...  I'm going to be horribly brutal here for a second. 
[03:52:30]  Misogynistic, even?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's nice when somebody supplies an orifice.  Go on.  But I don't give a shit either way.  I really don't.  Okay, so, like, you see this lovely woman...  Right.  ...who obviously has an affinity for you.  She's sending you a picture of herself naked for your approval, is why she would send that.  And you respond by saying, well, you're nice because you have a hole that I could put something in. 
[03:53:00]  Look, when you spell it...  Am I...  I mean...  Did I lead into that too much?  I kind of understand what he's saying, though.  I've been through so many girls, it's like they are useless.  How old are you?  25.  I like this dude.  I like this guy.  You guys should hang out.  No, he's cool.  He sounds like a cool dude.  Because I'm looking for a girl that doesn't exist.  I want a girl who I can chill with, who's cool, you know, and actually do things.  But every girl I meet, he's got emotional problems.  Right.  She's crazy.  There's health issues.  I'm going to be honest with you.  Can I break it down to you?  Yeah.  Here we go.  I'm going to break it down to you.  You're 25, okay?  You've got to find a girl that was married at one point and quite possibly was in an abusive 
[03:53:30]  relationship.  And I'm sorry.  I know that's awful.  I know there's going to be a lot of people upset.  Are you talking physically or mentally?  Both.  Either.  Both.  And if you find that, and find a girl that's 28, 29 years old, married, that was in an  abusive relationship, finds you, she's going to be like, oh my God, this guy's fucking  amazing.  But that's the problem I have, is that every girl I meet thinks I'm amazing, but it's  too quickly.  A month in, it's, I love you.  Well, I love you.  Must be tough. 
[03:54:00]  Must be real tough.  They're crazy bitches.  I'm going to break it down to you.  I'm going to break it down to you again.  Oh my God.  You've got to be honest with these girls right up front.  I'm always honest.  Because if you're just fucking them, they're thinking that it's going to...  Listen to you.  I'm trying to get my man a little bit of advice here.  These two morons.  If you break it down from the get-go, be like, look, I'm hanging out with a couple different  broads.  You know what I mean?  I got this going on, this going on.  I don't read it that often.  What?  I'm talking to Mars.  Nothing.  Go on.  Oh, I mean, is this, there's like three conversations going on.  Relax.  It's my show.  I'll dictate.  This is the way ONA show works. 
[03:54:30]  Well, do you want me to break it down to this guy or what?  More than I want my next breath.  Okay.  But that's what I'm saying is you need to just break it down and say, look, this is what's  up.  If you don't like it, cool.  I totally understand.  I do that.  I do that.  Why don't both of you, instead of just, maybe you would stop looking at women as either  crazy people or orifices.  But they turn out that way.  I don't look at them to begin with.  I think, oh, they're too relaxed.  You get to know them.  It's like, holy shit, I was way off on this girl. 
[03:55:00]  She's nuts.  Well, where are you looking for girls?  School, man.  College.  Yeah.  The best place to find girls.  And where do you think like Girls Gone Wild's filmed?  It's at college.  These girls are like looney tunes.  Do you guys, how long do you wait before you're intimate with these women?  It's really up to them in a sense, but it's real quick usually.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, guess what?  Girls are always quick.  I mean, they're there.  There's college.  Well, if a girl is going to go to either of you two jamokes and give her flower to you  that quickly, there's probably something wrong with her. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So maybe you look for the girl who you kind of have to work for a little bit.  I know you guys don't like working for women.  No, no, no.  Absolutely.  People say it's not the thrill of the kill.  It's the thrill of the catch.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  Because once you've achieved the reward, the game's over, isn't it?  Well, it's like when you're sending me pictures like this, it's like, okay, well, cool.  Like, I see it, you know.  Maybe that's a lesson for the girls then.  That maybe, like, if you, but I can't, like, I wouldn't think that any self-respecting 
[03:56:00]  woman would ever, like, want to be in close proximity to either of you two.  But I'm not really about that.  That's not true.  That's not true.  That's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  I'm trying to, we're trying to be honest.  No, and honesty, and honesty is the best policy.  You like that.  I like it a lot.  Okay.  But I'm going to tell you something else.  Girls like bad guys.  They like when guys have an edge.  And women want to control a man.  They think that I'm different than every other girl.  I can control this guy. 
[03:56:30]  I can lock him in.  I've been with my fiance for six years, and she's never, I've never gotten the vibe that  she was trying to control me.  But you know that Jess is a whole different thing.  She's a whole different thing.  She's like a nice, classy gal.  You got lucky, man.  Why don't you guys look for classy gals?  Because Jess, I'll tell you this, Jess has, we'll hang out with Troy.  Troy's come to Westchester, Bestchester, and hung out at the Sam Roberts Palace.  I have.  Okay?  Yeah.  And with Jess, and we'll go out, and we'll fucking hit up Buffalo Wild Wings. 
[03:57:00]  Like, there's no tomorrow.  Yeah.  And he'll be there.  But, Jess, Troy will leave, and Jess will mention one of her friends and say, do you think  she would like Troy, or Troy would like her?  And I look at her, and be, are you fucking crazy?  Yeah.  You would hook your friend?  Jess, are you fucking crazy?  This is your friend.  Yeah.  Why would you hook her up with Troy?  I'm not that big of a scumbag.  I really am not.  I'm not that big.  How many times has she done that so far?  Maybe, after the second time?  She learned a lesson.  She was like, you're right. 
[03:57:30]  Because she always, because I go, are you crazy?  She goes, yeah, you're right.  Why would I do that?  Yeah.  I mean.  No, I agree.  Hey, look.  I'm damaged good.  So, to find a nice, classy gal at this point, with my history, and you know some of the  things that I've done in my history.  More than anyone should know.  Yes.  And I only know the surface.  So, and I'm a very honest person.  That's true.  Because I found out that if you try to sweep those things under the rug, and say, oh,  we're not going to, they're eventually going to come up, and you're going to have to explain  them.  Either that, or they'll just weigh on you, and affect everything that you do. 
[03:58:00]  So, when the girls find out about what's involved, it's a whole ordeal.  And this kid is just trying to knock as many college girls up as he can.  I like this guy.  And there's nothing wrong with that, man.  Clean house.  But I use the honesty like he says, and the girl is always like, oh, well, it's refreshing  to hear, blah, blah.  And then they go, I'm not like those crazy girls.  I don't do the fall in love thing, blah, blah.  Month in, they turn into that girl.  But I got to give this guy a little bit of advice, too.  Make sure you don't knock one of them up, dude.  No, fuck no.  Trust me on that.  Why?  Do you know?  Fuck yeah, I know.  Because let me tell you something, these broads try to lock you in. 
[03:58:30]  They like you.  They're like, oh, go ahead, nut me.  Nut me.  It feels good.  And you're like, yeah, this feels great.  And then all of a sudden, you're like, oh, my fucking God.  Troy, did it feel good?  It felt great.  And then the aftermath, did that feel good?  No, it was a fucking nightmare.  It was a fucking nightmare.  What, going to the abortion clinic?  No, it was no abortion.  She lost it, thank God.  Thank God.  You prayed.  I prayed to Jesus.  Thank you, Jesus.  So, when this girl that you were seeing had a miscarriage, you said to yourself, 
[03:59:00]  I must have a guardian angel that just took that fetus out of the girl's body.  That's what you said to yourself.  Yeah.  Well, she was, I mean, I don't even want to get into it.  Like, my blood pressure is right.  No, I know.  You're starting to, you're feeling honest.  You're feeling comfortable.  Right.  But, yeah.  That don't, don't do it, dude.  Oh, no, I know.  This one girl, man, she was on that ring.  You know, they stick inside.  And now you feel that shit.  It sucks.  But one day, out of nowhere, I'm like, man, I'm fucking like, this feels pretty good. 
[03:59:30]  Holy shit, the ring's not in there.  Yeah.  And I fucking pull out, shoot it on her chest.  She's like, why did you do that?  I'm like, you don't have your ring in.  She's like, yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  She starts looking.  Oh, I can't find it.  How do you lose that?  It's just in your vagina.  You feel that shit.  You lost the ring.  Get the fuck out of here.  Loopy-ass bitches, dude.  These loopy-ass bitches.  I'll offer you some advice, Pips.  Maybe to make sure pregnancy doesn't happen, you take care of the contraception on your end. 
[04:00:00]  And that way, there's no line.  See, I'm going to tell you something, too, man.  There's no line.  With a condom, you can see the load.  Of course.  You see that.  You have that peace of mind.  Where's the potential baby?  Right there in this thing.  In the garbage.  It's going right in the garbage can.  Not you.  Yo, unless that shit rips, which has happened to me.  And that's an old shit.  That's right.  That's right.  That's why you're a very experienced young man.  I like this guy.  You run and get that fucking pill, man.  They take it.  They feel sick.  I don't give a shit.  That shit's gone, though.  The next day after pill.  Oh, my God.  It works.  The morning after pill.  The morning after pill.  Yeah, man.  I like that. 
[04:00:30]  Hell yeah.  Except in Jersey, it sucks.  When I think I was 17, I made this girl get it.  And you had to go see a doctor.  New York, you just go to a freaking Walgreens, and they just give it to you.  Mars, you think these guys are scumbags?  Man, you put me in this kid's shoes.  Do you ever bang two girls at the same time in college?  Still trying.  Still working on it.  Oh, so you got to get them drunk.  How about you?  Well, I mean, come on.  I mean, you were in a band.  You were doing a lot of things.  I've been around the block.  What do you want from me?  I've done the same room where there's a girl next to her, but not together. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, you got to get them in the mix.  Yeah, that's what I'm trying.  She's like, yo, come over and get in the mix.  Is that what you would say?  Girls just watch it, but it's like, oh, come over and get in the mix.  Where do I go?  Nah, I'm just saying.  I'm making shit up for this guy.  No, you're not.  Eric, would you consider yourself?  I would try to consider myself a decent young man, especially in comparison to this type  of activity.  Where do you see yourself on the spectrum?  I did not used to be a decent young man.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Back in the day, of course.  Yeah.  You're talking college?  College up through what age did you put the monster away? 
[04:01:30]  25.  25, 26, somewhere in there.  So when did you start being a, you know, just slinging that monster around?  Wow.  So you had seven good years of Nagel-ing around in you.  One thing that they were saying, too, about the, I don't know why am I saying this, but  it's like, oh, you know, you have the condom, you can see it has peace of mind.  You never leave it there.  You pretend you're throwing it out, but you wrap it up and you take it with you and you  throw it out away from. 
[04:02:00]  Eric, you were with women.  Yeah.  They thought so much of Eric Nagel that they would take a condom out of the trash can and  squeeze the remnants inside of them.  No.  I was with, I was with one girl.  Is that what you said, right?  I was, no, no, no, no, no.  That's crazy.  I was with one girl who said, did you, did you threw the condom out, right?  And I go, yes.  She goes, I can't find it.  And I go, why are you looking for it?  And she goes, well, I was just going through the garbage.  And that just set off in my head that she was maybe looking to do some fucked up shit. 
[04:02:30]  Troy, you've been around the block, like you said.  Pips, you're still young in the game.  Yeah.  He's got a lot of good years ahead of him now.  You think so?  Yeah.  You've been in the game.  Has something like this happened to you?  No.  Kind of in the trash?  No, but you know what, though?  I don't put it past these fucking loopy ass broads.  I really don't.  Yeah.  Because they're fucking nuts, dude.  Pennsylvania's fucked up.  And they think to themselves, like, oh, you're a cool guy.  You got something going on.  I'm fucking hooking up with all these turds.  You know what I mean?  Like, oh, I can lock this dude in if I do something like this. 
[04:03:00]  You know, there are good women out there.  There are.  Yeah.  There are.  Why don't you meet a couple of them?  Because it requires too much work, dude.  You don't like that?  No, no.  I mean, not right now, at least.  For me.  What about you, Pips?  I can't even find them.  Don't you want, like, a girl that could just, you could be your girlfriend?  Of course.  You could have a long-term relationship.  I mean, let's see.  Long-term kind of sucks, though, man.  I'm still young.  You don't like that.  You're still trying to sling it around.  Why make myself miserable?  I see my friends who are married now.  Married.  Have kids.  That's crazy.  I mean, look at this dude.  Why would you want him to go have some fun?  I don't even see my friends anymore. 
[04:03:30]  Their wives don't let him out.  It's like, why don't you want to be that?  I bet you this dude's getting tons of...  I bet you you're fucking hot girls, dude.  I can just...  Are you?  All over the spectrum.  Yeah.  You got any pictures?  I can bring some in.  So some ugly ones, too.  I had you.  After...  Are you sure you're not from Long Island?  No, no, no.  Okay, okay.  There's a point where you're like, holy shit, all these hot girls are great, but then I'm  like, it's not doing anything for me anymore.  I gotta try something else.  Troy, you been there?  I mean, you know.  I like a potpourri, if you will.  Yeah, potpourri's good.  Eric, you're in a position kind of, on this show anyway, where the image that is of you 
[04:04:00]  is of somebody who gets taken advantage of a lot, definitely the inferior in a relationship  setting, somebody who gets mocked out.  Like, Troy, based on Eric on this show, you would think he's got women telling him what  to do.  He's not like...  I mean, this guy that Eric is describing is Mr.  You know...  He sounds like a Master Coxman.  Yeah, Master Coxman, Mr. George Clooney, making sure his rubbers are out of the trash. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, they're like, I need to be, have this gentleman's sperm put in me.  On his way to the next broad's house?  Yeah.  I mean, what happened to this guy, Eric?  He gained 200 pounds.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  You want to talk about ours?  It was funny, though.  It was funny.  I know Mars took a chance, and that one paid off.  Eric?  Yeah, we're in a thousand and works out once in a while.  This was during the, what we'll call the sex bagel period.  Okay, so the sex bagel was a guy who was thin, right? 
[04:05:00]  Mars, and it was just sexing around.  They were...  You like to have a good time.  Yeah.  You like to have a good time.  Hey, you want to know...  You want to know...  Have a good time, maybe run interference for some other people, things like that.  What people?  People, you know, taking one friend away so that the other friend could go and mess around  with one, two, three, four other people.  Anyone that we know?  No, nobody you know.  Oh, okay.  But the sex bagel was just going over like, hey, baby, you want to find out why they call 
[04:05:30]  me the sex bagel?  No, I never used the name.  Tell me this.  And we have to go soon.  I just want to know this.  You're in a loving relationship with your gorgeous wife now.  Very much so.  Never would say anything to disrespect that woman.  She's a saint.  Does she ever get to see the sex bagel every now and then on, you know, a Saturday night?  The sex bagel just comes out to play, gets a little more aggressive.  Just tell me that.  No, because the sex bagel was not a good person.  Yeah, but maybe she likes a little bad boy every now and then.  Just for, just a taste. 
[04:06:00]  Just a taste and then you're back to being all nagel pants.  No, that's not a side idea.  Thanks.  And then the bag.  All right, well, Eric, I want you to do me a favor and let me know if the sex bagel ever  does come out to play again.  That will not happen.  I'd like some of the old stories to come out.  I would too.  We don't have time for him today, but Pips, I appreciate you being so candid with us today.  I'm glad we got to know you a little more.  I like this guy, Troy.  I'm going to hang with this dude.  Always a pleasure.  I'm sure.  Yeah, you two. 
[04:06:30]  Troy's giving him advice.  It's all horrible advice.  No, I like this guy.  This guy's heading down a good path.  Well, I can't wait to see how this relationship goes forward.  Mars, I'm sure you're with me there.  Absolutely.  And we'll see you all.  Opie and Anthony, oh, I will host, I'll be hosting Comedy by Request on Raw Dog tomorrow at noon.
