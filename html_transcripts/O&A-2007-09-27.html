<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-promotional montage highlighting its “shocking” and “offensive” nature, immediately followed by a jarring transition to a discussion about a suicidal listener.  The hosts then launched into crude sexual banter, including references to transvestites and “male camel toe,” setting the tone for the broadcast.  Recurring segments were introduced, including “Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday” (featuring one host's prominent bulge in sweatpants), and “Perv News Thursday,” which this week detailed the arrest of a cheerleading academy owner for child sexual abuse, met with vulgar and dismissive commentary from the hosts.  “Fun Fact Thursday” was haphazardly interwoven with listener calls, many of which were simply greetings (“Phone Call Thursday”). A significant portion of the show delved into the origin of the phrase "perhaps a little bit more than that," stemming from a misunderstanding with someone called Master Poe.  The show then veered into a nonsensical bit about the name "William," before returning to listener calls, including a fun fact about New Jersey's age of consent. Sports topics, including the Yankees/Red Sox rivalry, and a bizarre NFL memo banning cheerleaders from warming up near opposing teams, were discussed, along with Barry Bonds' last home game and the planned asterisk on his record-breaking home run.  A caller shared a fun fact about wakes and verifying death, leading to a discussion of cremation and death's grim realities.  Another caller offered incorrect video game trivia, prompting discussion of Halo 3’s success. A caller also shared anecdotes about their ex-girlfriend, a mortician.  The show touched upon the show *Kid Nation*, its perceived lack of brutality, and the hosts' perceived cuteness. The show concluded with a discussion of one host's habit of sleeping with the television on, sparked by an unexpected same-sex kiss on a soap opera.

The show continued with humorous commentary on a soap opera scene involving a man's hands and kissing, before transitioning to a scathing review of the Democratic presidential debate.  Hillary Clinton was heavily criticized, using offensive language, and described as unlikable and incapable of answering questions.  She was contrasted negatively with Condoleezza Rice and Joe Biden.  A significant focus was on independent candidate Mike Gravel, whose eccentric behavior (including a YouTube video of him throwing a rock into a lake) and contradictory statements during the debate were found highly entertaining. Clips of Gravel's debate answers were played. The hosts then reviewed the reality show “Beauty and the Geek,” playing clips of the “beauties'” uninformed answers in a political debate segment, mocking their lack of knowledge on minimum wage, marijuana legalization, and Alaskan oil drilling.  The political discussion resumed with criticism of George W. Bush's grammatical error ("children's do learn") and the Phil Spector trial mistrial, mentioning Sandy Kane's involvement.  The show returned to Hillary Clinton's debate performance before a caller from West Palm Beach revealed low ratings and the station's intention to replace them.  Upcoming guests Bill Burr and Carrot Top were briefly mentioned.  The show concluded this segment with discussion of the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, focusing on the Yankees' comeback season and Roger Clemens' return, and the New England Patriots' “Spygate” scandal, speculating about the prevalence of rule-bending in professional sports. A clip of Susan Waldman's enthusiastic commentary on Clemens' return was played.

In-studio guests Bill Burr and Vinny Brand (owner of the Stress Factory comedy club) joined the hosts.  The conversation started with sports, including a crude joke about rape, before shifting to Burr's move to Los Angeles and the aging process of actors and the roles they receive.  A significant portion focused on comparing Vinny Brand's voice to Matt Roloff from "Little People, Big World," attempting to find and play a clip proving the resemblance.  This was interspersed with tangents about frustrating air travel experiences and airline delays. The hosts and guests shared numerous anecdotes about flights.  The show played audio clips of newscasters making mistakes, often involving cursing.  A lengthy segment played excerpts from a 1970s “8-track porn” tape with explicit sexual content.  Carrot Top's physique was discussed, and a caller complained about the show's lateness and early departure.  The broadcast ended with discussion about moving to a new studio.


The show began with a listener's story about watching porn as a child with a school projector.  Sexually explicit audio, described as a scene from a story about a "delivery boy," was played.  Carrot Top arrived in studio, and the hosts and others engaged in banter focused heavily on his physique, workout routine, career, and experiences with other comedians.  Numerous comments about his muscular build used crude and humorous language.  A listener's call added to the discussion about Carrot Top's career and success.  Sandy Kane, described as a burlesque dancer and previous guest, entered the studio. The conversation became increasingly vulgar and sexually charged, with crude jokes and comments about Sandy Kane's body.  A running gag involved her body odor, culminating in on-air personalities smelling her genitals and anus and sharing their reactions.  The segment concluded with raunchy humor and promotion of Carrot Top's shows.


The final segment featured Sandy Kane and Carrot Top.  The focus was on Sandy Kane's performance, which included a topless rendition of "Rock Around Dolly Parton's Twat" and an awkward pole dance.  The hosts and Carrot Top made sexually explicit comments about Sandy Kane's appearance and performance.  Sandy Kane's responses were equally crude.  The conversation frequently shifted to Carrot Top's career and the Phil Spector trial, with Sandy Kane claiming to have been threatened by Spector.  The segment ended with Sandy Kane's departure (leaving a mess), and further sexually explicit remarks and banter from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock, Josh, Opie and Anthony.  Shock, Josh, Opie and Anthony.  Shock, Josh, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put a 380 to my chest and a full charger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp.  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp. 
[00:01:00]  They are sick freaks!  So you're kind of like, um, transvestite, or transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst, the worst show I've, this is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Alright, there we are. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  My mouses are all tangled.  Your mice. 
[00:02:00]  I've got mice.  Mises.  I've got three, uh, mises that I work here.  I hate mises to pieces.  And, uh, there we go.  Now my mises are working properly.  Thank goodness.  I love looking at the instant feedback right away in the morning.  Yeah.  Um.  Before we've done anything.  Yeah, well, well, uh, Jack in Jersey, fun fact, I like to make werewolf movies, very good. 
[00:02:30]  Who doesn't?  Uh, Tom, one of many people, for some reason on the instant feedback, just quoting Pink Floyd  lyrics today.  Enough drinking or smoking pot.  Going back to yesterday's show, I guess, we were talking about Pink Floyd a little bit.  Uh, but Tom writes, uh, remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.  All righty.  Yeah.  And Boobie Man from Brooklyn writes, good morning.  I hope someone named Carol calls today. 
[00:03:00]  And then he writes, linger longer.  Yeah.  Linger longer.  Well, good morning to everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thursday.  I don't even, I, I lose track of what's going on on Thursday.  Uh, Thursday is, um, Thursday's light.  Oh, that's kind of good.  I'll tell you why.  We had a lot of really good, uh, themes for Thursday, but they're falling by the wayside 
[00:03:30]  because, well, first of all, I refuse to bring in my sweatpants.  Oh, no, is that male camel toe, extreme male camel toe Thursday?  And it's not even that I refuse.  I, I need to be reminded and, and no one reminds me.  Gee, I wonder why.  It's the sweatpants.  Hey, uh, Opie, could you bring in your sweatpants tomorrow?  Remember to do that.  Hey, at least I'm not looking at gay guys, uh, on, on a soap opera.  Hey, hey, I wasn't watching it.  We'll get into that in a second.  But, uh, these are the sweats that my, my, uh, my girlfriend, my fiancee, uh, she hates 
[00:04:00]  when I leave the apartment wearing.  They, uh.  And I never notice, but it makes me look like I, I got something going on.  Auto, auto pup tent.  It's just, there's just a massive, massive.  Yeah.  Like.  It's just a wreck.  There's, it's impressive.  Because after she pointed out to me, I'm like, you know what?  Yeah, I look, uh, I look pretty impressive in these things.  Sweatpants are very deceiving.  But the problem is, I go to the gym, and then I do my back exercises. 
[00:04:30]  Ugh.  Oh, and then they, ugh.  It's just kind of there.  Looks like I'm, uh, I'm, uh, wearing a cup.  Looks like I'm, like, a catcher.  In the, um, in the major leagues.  Eek.  So, uh, those are the sweats I need to bring in to do Extreme Male Camel Toe.  Yeah.  Because it, because it is Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  One of these themes that hasn't really, uh, taken off.  I thought we'd see some guys on Pal Talk doing it. 
[00:05:00]  Maybe some of the guys around here.  Um, I'm kind of thankful we don't.  So that one is kind of falling, uh, yes, then.  I've actually thought of reminding you on a Wednesday.  And I was like, I'm not sending this email.  I, I, there's no way I can ask my boss to please bring in his most presentable sweats.  Bring in those sweats.  You know, the ones that really accentuate.  Accentuate the area.  Yeah, so that one might be, uh, going away. 
[00:05:30]  Might be gone.  Perv News Thursday.  We've gone over this a few times.  It was supposed to be a fun little bit that we like to do once a week.  And, uh, Danny brings just horrific Perv News stories.  And, and then everyone's, like, just driving their car, staring at their radio, going, what  the F is wrong with these guys?  That's kind of terrible.  Right.  It's hard to come up with a Perv News story that's, um, good.  And, like, funny.  And ends happily for everybody. 
[00:06:00]  Except the perp, maybe.  True.  Well, what's, uh, today's Perv News?  It's, it's something to do with cheerleaders.  Oh.  Uh.  This might be a good one.  Cheerleading Academy.  Owner Arrested in Sex Probe.  Now, that sounds like, like it could be fun.  Why, uh.  Yeah, that does.  And.  It sounds like we could do a little something with that.  Do we have the story?  We're in charge of cheerleaders.  Look, I don't want, I don't want Perv News to go away.  Where's the story?  Let's see if that one's a fun Perv News. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Story.  So far, it's setting up to be.  What did he do?  Something, uh, like drill a hole in the wall.  Let's see if this is fun.  A cheerleading school owner has been arrested for investigation of having sex with an underage  student.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Oh, boy.  Maybe this.  Neil, 28, owner of the Vancouver Cheer Academy, was arrested late Tuesday for investigation  of sexual misconduct with a minor.  Jazz hands.  Operating in leased space in a business park, the academy offers cheerleading classes. 
[00:07:00]  What parent would send their hot little daughter to cheerleading class in a business park?  Yeah, that's, uh...  In a space in a business park that this guy had a rent.  That's a little suspect.  For competitions from the local to the national levels, as well as private lessons.  Hmm.  Tumbling classes.  A gymnasian, a gymnasian open to the public, and a parents' night out for children ages 5  to 18.  According to the affidavit filed by prosecutors, a 17-year-old girl told Cindy Bull, an investigator 
[00:07:30]  from the Child Abuse Intervention Center, that the two had sex at Finger's apartment.  What?  Who's apartment?  His name is Neil Finger.  Neil Finger.  He's single.  Neil Finger.  His name is Neil Finger?  Neil Finger is the star of Perv News today, yeah.  A name like that.  Mm-hmm.  It's gonna be trouble.  Each time he told her not to tell because he would get in trouble.  So she was into it.  She's 17.  Yeah.  He's like in that...  He's 28.  Eh. 
[00:08:00]  Maybe getting a bit on the older side as far as a 17-year-old goes, but it's not like  this is like some 15-year-old...  That's an ethics problem.  That's an ethical problem more than a...  Unless, what, was she into it or...  Yeah, she was totally into it because the last line says it all.  The girl's mother read about the matter in her daughter's diary.  Oh.  So the daughter was fine with everything.  The mom read it in the diary and said, whoa, whoa, hey, I gotta report this guy.  The girl's in your silly diaries just writing about getting it.  Yeah, just stop writing about getting it. 
[00:08:30]  Stop writing about it.  Especially if you're underage.  Just knock off that jotting down what you did the night before.  What a snoopy mother.  Filthy little girl.  Mother's gonna poke around.  Yeah.  Snoop.  I think I got the lock opened.  Yeah.  I read about that.  I'd love to see her face.  She's probably sitting there with the diary in one hand and her hand over her mouth.  Right.  With her mouth kind of open and her eyes all wide.  And the pillow down there.  So she could kind of read it and use the pillow. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, that Neil finger.  Oh, Neil finger.  Good old Neil finger.  And his four brothers when they curl up.  The mom was probably reading the diary hoping to read something nice about herself.  Seeing what the daughter says about her.  Yes.  And instead got that fun.  Glad I didn't send her to the chilling school run by Bill Cox.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  CW.  I do.  CW from Scranton says cheerleading classes with Mr. Finger. 
[00:09:30]  Are these parents idiots?  Yes.  I submit to you yes.  What do you think of your teacher?  He stinks.  Here you go.  Awful me from Wack Bag.  Perv News fun fact.  I'm listening to the show naked.  So there you go.  There's your Perv News.  I think we got through it today.  I mean, there might be other Perv News stories today because it is Perv News Thursday.  That was good.  It's not that bad.  The girl's 17.  It's kind of hot.  The guy's, you know, kind of an idiot.  He's got a stupid name. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I like it.  It wasn't disturbing.  It's titillating.  Didn't end with a body in a swamp.  Didn't end with barbecue tools.  Yeah.  And a newborn in an alley.  Whatever the hell that one was that blew up this whole bit.  Yeah.  And then, of course, it's fun fact Thursday.  We started that a little bit.  And, of course, that's why the phones are ringing.  Awful.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Dan in Wyoming.  Dan, what's up?  Not much, guys.  What's up?  Hey, Anthony. 
[00:10:30]  Yes, sir.  Yeah, I don't have anything for the show, but it's phone call Thursday.  Phone call Thursday.  I thought, wait a minute.  You said fun fact.  I thought he was going to call with a fun fact.  No, no.  He doesn't have to call with a fun fact.  And then it was just stupid phone call Thursday.  Phone call Thursday.  Oh, do I hate phone call Thursday?  It's our most brilliant concept.  It's the dumbest thing.  They called just for the sake of calling.  It's phone call Thursday.  I hate phone call Thursday. 
[00:11:00]  Phone call Thursday.  Thursday.  Phone call Thursday sucks.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn Ace, what's going on, buddy?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi, guys.  I just figured I'd call in and say hello.  See, this bit is the worst.  The worst.  Good bit, Anthony.  I'm not calling for a bit.  No, I'm just calling and saying hello.  I love getting under Anthony's skin with phone call Thursday. 
[00:11:30]  It's not a good bit.  It just.  All right.  Thanks for the call, Brooklyn Ace.  Let's say hi to Jackie in Jersey.  Jackie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to wish you a happy phone call Thursday.  No, you can't do that.  It's been a couple weeks since I've called, so I figured you guys missed me or something,  so I wanted to call.  No, we didn't.  Why would you call to wish us a happy, the fact that you called?  Anthony, but seriously, though, I hear you have a new cat named Jack Jack.  Where'd you get him from? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jack Jack.  Right, right.  I barely bring this up, but Steve from Bayshore.  You know Steve.  Oh, God.  Why are you turning it on me?  Yeah, I got it from him.  In all seriousness, though, where is the expression, perhaps a little bit more than that?  Where is that from?  You know, we were just talking about that the other day that most people have no idea.  It's a mess.  I have no idea where that comes from.  There's probably 10, 12 people don't know where that came from.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony.  For the people that don't linger longer, why don't we let him in on that one? 
[00:12:30]  No.  No?  All right.  Screw him.  Well, sometimes you might not know the right amount of people and someone has to tell you.  Right.  But perhaps means that I'm not sure, but I think.  Well, Master Poe, like, because Master Poe is a character in himself.  It would help out the show.  His name should be Larry Literal.  We were in their car in L.A.  I think, when you guys were doing Lenoir, it was a time before, probably way before that.  No, it was the poker tournament in L.A.  And we're all in this SUV going to the hotel, and we're riding through Beverly Hills where 
[00:13:00]  the mansions are disgusting.  And Jimmy has a funny bit that he does.  He gets a chuckle out of everybody.  He'll underestimate everything because it's ridiculous.  And the more ridiculous it is, the funnier it is.  There's all these, like, probably, you know, how many thousands of square foot mansions  in Beverly Hills along Rodeo or whatever.  Some of these worth probably $100 million.  Yeah.  A house.  $14 million.  $15 million. 
[00:13:30]  Some of those worth $8 million.  Perhaps less than that old.  No, some of those are worth $100 million.  Are you kidding me?  They were, it was just that type of money.  It was like Hollywood money.  And so I'm joking around that I said to everybody in the truck, I bet you some of these places  are worth $100 grand.  And Master Poe was in the truck.  And in all seriousness.  Complete seriousness.  Complete seriousness.  Looks at Jimmy and goes, perhaps more than that, Jim. 
[00:14:00]  And we all just sat there in stunned silence.  We were stupefied.  Yeah.  It was to hear a grown man not understand that I was being sarcastic.  We all silently felt pity and revulsion as we stared straight ahead.  The werewolf retard would have understood that the houses went for more than $100,000.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Movies.  Movies. 
[00:14:30]  I like turtles.  Of course you do, you little kid.  Who doesn't?  You're a kid.  Turtles.  So we've been doing it ever since.  Ever since.  For almost three years.  It's just been going on and on and on.  Dude, you didn't play William.  Yeah, you didn't play William.  Please.  William's sexy.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  Dresses.  My name is Oscar De La Hoya and I like to wear dresses.  My name is Oscar De La Hoya and I like to wear bikinis. 
[00:15:00]  Bikini tops and a tutu.  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  Polish.  My name is Oscar De La Hoya and I like marital aids on my...  What?  My name is William and I like eating lead paint chip.  I love William.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  Dresses.  Dresses.  He was actually the winner of the How Many Ways Can Disappoint Your Father competition.  You want a fun fact? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, please.  All right.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  It is fun fact Thursday.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you know that Neil Finger wouldn't have been arrested in Jersey because  the age of consent is only 16.  Now, that's a fun fact.  There's a person that gets...  That's a fun fact for everyone.  Fun fact Thursday.  Jimmy doesn't look...  No, because people say that, but they forget there has to be a certain age difference between  you.  Yes.  Like, when the age of 16 is the consent age, I believe 22 might be the cap or something 
[00:16:00]  like that.  You can't be 50 and have a 16-year-old.  Well, 18 is consent for everybody, but if you're 16 or even 17 in some places, I think  the guy can only be X amount of years.  Sounds like someone has studied this stuff.  Let's just say, someone may have had reason to.  Let's go to Richard.  Someone from Jersey.  Richard in Missouri.  What's up, Richard?  Missouri.  It's fun call Thursday.  Thank you.  And great, Richard.  What did you call for?  No reason.  Phone call Thursday.  Ah, just for phone call Thursday. 
[00:16:30]  See, this is...  Every line.  Is lit up.  No, who else is frustrated by phone call Thursday is all the regular callers to the radio show.  Yeah, because it ties up the phones.  Lisa in Ohio.  Lisa.  Good morning.  Wanted to wish you a phone call Thursday.  Happy phone call Thursday.  No.  And I also wanted to know who the vote was for for Dancing with the Stars.  Who's everyone voting for?  Wow, I really can't get into that show, to be honest with you.  Dancing with the Stars?  Is that still on?  I saw Marie Osmond the other night. 
[00:17:00]  I was taking a peek.  I saw Jane Seymour.  I don't really care about that show, to be honest with you.  You like it?  We had old...  Well, your friend Mark Cuban's on it this year.  Oh, is he?  What's it called?  Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah, they had pogo stick leg last year.  Why would you want to watch anything else?  How are you going to follow that list?  Yeah.  With two stumps doing the can-can and the headstand.  Two little stumps raising a quarter inch each.  Doing the can't-cant. 
[00:17:30]  Have a good day.  I'm fucking out.  All right, Lisa.  Two stumps.  I hope we're not disappointing Lisa and others that we're not going to be following Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, is that fun?  That could be your line of the day right off the bat.  Ah, well, I hope not.  I want more funny.  More funny on the way.  Let's say hi to...  Wow.  John in New York.  John, what's up?  Dude, phone call Thursday.  Phone call Thursday.  Phone call Thursday.  There you go.  Phone call Thursday. 
[00:18:00]  Love you guys.  I hate you.  Are you a Yankee fan?  No, I follow sports, dude.  All right.  All right, then I love you.  Well, Yankees clinched.  F the Yankees!  They're in the playoffs.  This is 13 years in a row.  Go Sox, go!  Under the leadership of Joe Torrey.  How about that?  How about that?  That's fantastic.  How about that he's a lame duck?  Well...  He wins 90-some-odd games after a horrendous start, and he can't even get a contract from  Mr. Steinbrenner. 
[00:18:30]  Well, if Mr. Steinbrenner wants to see how the postseason plays out, you know...  Oh, Torrey?  Yeah.  Torrey has another 90-plus.  Has he ever been guaranteed a spot until the playoffs and everything was done?  It's always he's hanging on by his fingernails.  Fingernails.  He may not want to do it.  He may be wanting to get out.  Maybe not.  Maybe he wants out.  All right.  That's a good start to the Opie and Anthony show right there.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  It's a quality start. 
[00:19:00]  Phone call Thursday.  And because I know people are still waking up.  Mm-hmm.  Still trying to get themselves together.  Yeah.  To listen to the show today, I think we need a little sing-along from Roland.  Yeah.  Roland's going to wake everyone up today by singing a little Pavarotti.  That's nice.  Some famous Pavarotti.  This would be great if you're laying there and your alarm goes off and it's to this.  Yeah.  Because it's so relaxing and it'll wake you up, but it's not going to jar you awake. 
[00:19:30]  It's Roland singing Ave Maria.  Mm-hmm.  Or Ave Maria.  No, it's Roland.  It's Ava Maria.  Ava.  What the hell?  Here's the haunting sounds of Roland.  Yes.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  Oh, we're Maria. 
[00:20:00]  Ave Maria.  Yeah.  Oh, we're Maria.  Gracias.  Yeah.  Maria.  Yeah.  Maria. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, gratia por nia, ave, ave Dominus, Dominus tecum benita, tu inmoversia, et tu benedicia, et tu fructus ventris, ventris te jesus.  Ave Maria, ave Maria, mata de ora por nobis, prectrobius, ora por nobis, ora, ora pro nobis, prectrobius, 
[00:21:00]  Ave Maria, nux et in hora mortris, et in hora mortris, notoris, ave Maria. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  You think he'll get an 11-minute standing ovation?  Bravo, bravo, bravo, bravo.  El Faxo.  El Faxo.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:22:30]  Tell a friend.  Also, tell a friend, we're going to Boston.  Yep.  Oh, yeah, we're going to Boston.  We'll have details soon, hopefully.  Yeah, we're going to go up there.  So, good morning to everyone listening on WBCN.  Instant feedback coming in.  We got a few.  Jack Jack the Cat from Staten Island.  He writes, hey, Opie, here's a fun fact for Thursday.  What?  He's not from Staten Island. 
[00:23:00]  Jack Jack?  Yeah, he is.  Okay.  Must be a different one.  He stole your cat's name.  Bastard.  His fun fact is the Mets are choking big time.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  The lead is now down to one game.  As if you didn't know.  I know.  How big was their lead?  I think there was seven games up.  Oh, they're in the middle of a huge, a big crash and burn chokage.  They are choking.  Hey, the Boston Yankees, I know we're 14 down at one point.  And, like, where's the Red Sox now?  How far ahead are they? 
[00:23:30]  I think they need, what?  What's their magic number?  Two?  No, I think if the Red Sox win and the Yankees lose, they clinch.  Yeah.  Right?  That's two, I think.  That means a combination of things.  One win.  Yeah.  I think it's two.  Four or two.  Yeah, you're right.  I mean, I think they'll be in.  Considering there's three games left, four games, whatever.  I think they'll do all right.  Also, some quick sports happening right now.  Dominic and PA, did you guys see the report for the ban of NFL cheerleaders from doing stretches? 
[00:24:00]  Have you heard about this story yet?  Stretches?  This is hilarious.  Sounds fantastic.  Should this be in perv news?  Dude, I don't know what's going on with the NFL.  You know, you got that cheating thing with the Pats, but I'm sticking up for the Pats.  I think most NFL teams were doing exactly what Bill Belichick was doing.  They got caught.  But they kind of got caught and blew up everyone else's spot.  So they put the kibosh on the whole thing.  I just have a feeling about that.  And now, the NFL.  Wow.  This Pal Talk's got to be turned off. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  Who's that girl with the nice bosoms?  We got a brand new girl on Pal Talk flashing like crazy.  What's the name?  Oddball.  Oddball.  All right.  Let me take a look.  How about you do that stuff during commercials so we can maybe still broadcast to everybody?  That just stopped me in my tracks.  All right.  Anyway.  NFL blows whistle on sideline passes, orders home cheerleaders to keep away from visiting players.  Listen to this.  The NFL apparently thinks its players are concerned more about sideline scoring than their coach's game plan. 
[00:25:00]  The league reportedly sent a memo to all 32 teams ordering them not to allow their cheerleaders to warm up  or do anything distracting in front of the visiting team's bench.  Supposedly, there were concerns around the league that some teams specifically ordered their cheerleaders to perform in front of visiting teams  in hopes of distracting them from pregame instruction.  Wow. 
[00:25:30]  Brilliant.  What the hell's going on with the NFL this year?  They've also asked them to stop handing out ping pong balls to the cheerleaders.  That trick works in the Philippines, but not in our stadium.  Some players felt they were being a little distracted.  Yeah, I guess.  You've got to imagine there's a running back out there that is a little, you know,  Yoo-hoo!  Running for 300, 400 yards a game, and everyone's like, I don't understand it.  We had the cheerleaders doing all kinds of stretches in front of the bench.  It's like the fact that you said he's a little Yoo-hoo. 
[00:26:00]  Yoo-hoo!  That's like the way a 1950s guy would point you.  Yeah.  How is he?  He's a little, you know, with your hand weight.  Yoo-hoo!  Well, they took the word away.  Of course.  I just love saying because it's just fun to say on the radio.  By the way, uh...  No hate behind the words.  It's just fun to say, but the lawyers have a problem with it.  He's a fruit!  Fruit!  Yeah, we can go with that, I guess.  The other F word.  The Sox already clinched a spot, but it's two games for them to win the division.  Well, that's...  That's what it is.  Well, that's what I was sort of getting at, but we didn't explain the... 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  Well, there you go.  So what do you think of that?  Cheerleaders stretching in front of the...  I think it's brilliant.  I think whoever came up with that is brilliant.  Great.  Just distract them.  Stretching.  Imagine what they were doing.  Oh, those Hewers.  And then another cute little thing, the Bonds ball will have the asterisk.  Remember, we were talking about this the other day.  Echo bought the ball, Mark Echo. 
[00:27:00]  Yep.  You know, the fashion designer.  And then he had a little poll online, and there were a couple choices, or three choices,  and the one that won, they're going to put an asterisk on the Bonds home run ball.  The record-breaking home run ball.  And that way, where does it end up?  I think they're going to give his private collection, or...  I think he's...  Yeah, he's sending it off to the Baseball Hall of Fame after he puts this asterisk on.  Yeah, but they're going to, like, turn it around.  Well, then you've got to put asterisks all over the thing. 
[00:27:30]  Well, there might be a stipulation that he has to show.  He has to show it.  Like, he may say...  Oh, I'll...  I'll give it to you, but you have to display it like this.  And they may even, on some weird level, like it, like what we said to do.  That's interesting.  And Barry Bonds played his last home game for the Giants yesterday.  That's not good.  Whoa!  What was that?  I hope no one's got one of their...  An important package from FedEx on that truck.  What do they do when that happens?  What happens?  We're just looking at the news.  They're showing, like, all the highlights. 
[00:28:00]  A FedEx truck just completely destroyed.  It was split open, and just all of the packages and stuff laying all over the highway.  I guess it absolutely, positively won't be there overnight.  Well, I don't know what you do.  It's just...  It sucks.  And Barry Bonds, I'll say it again because you guys looked at that video, but he played  his last home game for the Giants last night.  That's it.  He's done with the Giants.  Why, though?  Why wouldn't they re-up the guy if he just brought in the home run record?  I think they've had it with him. 
[00:28:30]  Probably, yeah.  I'll be honest with you.  But he's not a...  I guess a steroid.  And he's also 40...  What is he now?  43, 44, somewhere around there?  It's amazing how old you could be in baseball and still play.  Well, but the Giants don't think...  Because he's going to demand a lot of money.  Yeah.  The Giants are like, you're 40...  Whatever.  Four years old.  Well, there's another prospect for the Yankees.  Yeah.  Pick up another old guy he could pitch.  I'm just...  I kind of like...  As much as he did...  You know, Bonds maybe shouldn't have... 
[00:29:00]  Steroids, but everybody's using steroids.  It's like, there's no sluggers not using it.  It's not like he's doing it in the age of Babe Ruth.  Everybody's...  It's like, come on, man.  Yeah.  The guy is one of the greatest sluggers ever.  And they're taking it away.  It really does kind of annoy me.  And he also has the record for the biggest head.  Oh, it's a man to ever play baseball.  Let's...  All right.  We'll skip the phone call Thursday.  We'll save you this break there, Andy.  Uh, Nick in Philly.  What's going on, buddy?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I got a fact for you.  Okay. 
[00:29:30]  The tradition of having a wake before a funeral.  You know why?  Um...  I think I do, actually.  I think I know that.  Jimmy, you know?  You go first.  I'll tell you the truth.  Okay.  I believe it's to make sure the person's dead.  Well, yeah, obviously.  It's why it's called a wake.  No, that's not what I heard, actually.  Oh, okay.  Yes, Jimmy?  It was because if you buried him first, everybody would track dirt through the living room.  I don't know, sir.  The parlor.  What's the answer there, Nick? 
[00:30:00]  I also heard that it was because, like, back then, bowls and plates and cups and things  they would eat out of were made of lead, so they couldn't actually tell if the body was  dead more than it was just unconscious from the heavy metal poisoning.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  They would just lay it out for a few days to see if the body would wake up.  Well, isn't that what I said?  Yes.  Yeah, you got to make sure the person's dead.  Well, yeah, but...  So what?  People were waking up back in the day?  Well, they call it a wake?  I mean, every once in a while, you get the goof story that someone woke up. 
[00:30:30]  But was it such a problem that they had to start this whole thing?  Is it always happening?  That's got to be creepy.  I'll bet you they exhumed a couple of bodies at one point and found claw marks inside the  coffin.  Oh, and fingernails all with the splinters underneath the...  That's not good.  Yeah.  Can you imagine waking up like that?  That's not good.  That would stink.  Well, you know what you got to do?  There's a certain punch you can do from a very short distance, and you got to keep doing  it, doing it, and then dig your way out.  I have to be creepy.  I saw that somewhere. 
[00:31:00]  I have to be creepy.  Kill Bill?  Perhaps.  Huh?  Yes, perhaps.  All right.  Let's...  Just lay there rotting.  Oh, would that be horrible?  Awful.  Pitch black, and then when the air starts getting real thick.  Oh, Jimmy can't breathe.  He doesn't like not being able to breathe stories.  No, my thing, too.  I don't want to be restricted in any way.  I know.  Ugh.  Imagine the bottom of your foot itched.  Ugh.  And you couldn't bend your arm.  That's the least of your problems.  How about you just can't bend your arm to even touch your head? 
[00:31:30]  Like, you're just stuck in a position like that?  Oh, I hate being in a, like, restrictive, can't move.  I want to be, like, cremated and then have my ashes scattered at the cheerleader school  that your old finger started.  The old finger.  The old finger.  Let's go to Buffalo.  Greg, listening on the edge, what do you got today?  Hey, I got a fun fact for you guys.  Okay.  Is it fun?  All right, what is the most sold video game to date?  Halo 3.  Yeah, we were talking about that the other day.  We have to... 
[00:32:00]  You got to assume it's Halo.  Actually, it's not.  It's an older game.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  I'll go with Ms. Pac-Man.  Um, I'm going to go with, uh, Pong.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before you give the answer, though, Pong and Ms. Pac-Man are dumb answers because those  are, you know, in their heyday, it was more arcade games.  Yeah.  Uh, best-selling video game ever.  And you're saying it's not Halo.  It is not.  And it's an older game. 
[00:32:30]  EverQuest.  It's pretty old.  Pretty old.  No.  It's not John Madden.  No.  It's not a sports game, right?  Not a sports game.  Frogger.  Oh, it is a sports game?  No.  Oh, uh, uh, uh, Tetris?  No.  How about, uh...  No, he said it's not a sports.  Donkey Kong.  See, those...  A lot of those are arcade games, so you got to think, like, when you brought video games  into the home.  I can't wait for you to hear it.  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Mario Brothers. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah!  Super Mario Brothers.  Which one?  Super Mario Brothers.  Uh, the original, yeah.  Nope.  I...  Wait, the...  What?  What is this?  I hate this guy.  Mario Brothers...  Come on, that's close enough.  Super Mario 2.  You're on vacation.  Super 3.  What?  It's Super Mario Brothers 3 for the Nintendo.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, I was close.  Super Mario Brothers.  By the way...  Yeah, you win the prize.  Hold on.  Now, Than has, uh, put up a website here, and it says Super Mario Brothers sold 40.23 million, 
[00:33:30]  and, uh, Super Mario Brothers 3, 18 million.  Yay.  What's up with that, douche?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  All right.  We got to do a little more research.  Uh, top-selling video game of all time.  Did any...  Did you guys actually watch the documentary, uh, Donkey Kong?  I got it.  I suggested highly.  I got it at my house.  I got to check it out.  Yeah, it's really cool, man.  Speaking of, uh, video games, our own Than has already beaten Halo 3. 
[00:34:00]  And I know it's more of an online type of game, but why are you sitting around beating  Halo 3 already?  And how long did it take you?  Uh, it took me about 10 hours, I think.  What a creep.  And you just played it straight for 10 hours?  No, it was about 7 to 3.  I want an honest answer.  Where, you, you, you were late the other day because you were up playing Halo.  No, that was, that was the day before. 
[00:34:30]  I had never...  Oh, damn it.  Maybe that was from giddy anticipation.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know you were a huge Halo fan.  Um...  That's one game I've never played.  Oh, it's fantastic.  And the online stuff is great.  I mean, you get the 14-year-old factor, obviously, which ruins everything, but...  Yeah.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I'm gonna have to get it just for the online play.  I'll be spending 10 times that amount of time on the actual online parts, so... 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  My girlfriend's pretty psyched.  How good is Halo 3?  It's really good.  You know, it finishes the story.  You heard it here first.  Halo 3 is really good.  By the way, a little fun fact of my own with Halo 3, Microsoft's making a lot of money  off this thing.  It's grossed more money than the top-grossing movie ever, which is Spider-Man 3.  That grossed more than Titanic?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The sale of that video game has grossed more than any movie.  We're at a point in society where hot video games are outselling really big movies. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  They cost a lot more, too.  Spider-Man 3 did now gross Titanic.  That was the biggest grossest of all time.  No, I think Spider-Man is now the biggest grossing movie or the biggest opening or something.  Yeah, but that's all messed up because, like, the...  I know, dollar value.  The dollar value and the ticket prices.  Gone with the Wind is, like, the biggest.  Well, now that...  It costs 10 cents to get in.  Now that it costs...  For the love of God.  Now that it costs $20 to go see a stupid movie...  Yeah.  ...on a primitive screen, by the way.  When I was watching Into the Wild the other day, I'm like, why haven't they updated movie 
[00:36:00]  theaters?  Most people...  You don't even have to have a lot of money.  Most people have better systems in their homes now.  Yeah.  Than what you see in a stupid movie theater.  And they're going to have to...  What is going on with that?  Because eventually people are just going to not stop going to the theaters and get them  at home.  Like, they'll be shown in home.  Once there's a suicide bombing in a movie theater, which will happen or something...  Oh, Jesus, Jim.  Thanks.  I'm telling you.  Once something like that happens, people are going to find a way to get the movies in  their homes and they're going to watch them at home.  Find a way?  I mean, like, live.  Right. 
[00:36:30]  Legally?  We don't all have Steve C.  Right.  Don't even joke like that.  Don't joke.  I don't need people coming to my house.  Don't need the authorities.  Sorry, they won't know what the website is because we're not allowed to mention it.  Yeah.  I don't want to find you.  There's watermarks on his movies that he puts out.  Stolen by Steve Foundry.  Stolen by Foundry Music.  Jimmy, what was the last movie you went to?  Me.  I mean, when you go to the movies now, it just feels like it's an old experience now.  It just feels old. 
[00:37:00]  What is the old?  The seats still suck for the most part in most theaters.  I mean, you got a few that know how to give you a nice seat to watch a movie.  Yeah.  And the screen is so...  The detail sucks.  And I'll tell you, the last movie was that terrible Richard Gere movie, whatever it was  called, with Terrence Howard, the premiere.  That's it.  The Hunting Party, which was an atrocity film.  It wasn't funny or poignant or sweet.  Yeah.  We'll be hunting for a gerbil. 
[00:37:30]  Love that one.  No Richard Gere story can go without a gerbil reference.  Of course not.  Hey, by the way...  He sneezes, and all of a sudden, there's a tuft of gerbil hair, and they're like, wait  a minute.  He's like litmus from Escape from Alcatraz.  He was hiding it the whole time.  Halo 3 sold 170 million copies?  Or money.  Oh, money.  You scared me.  Halo 3 brought in $170 million in the first day of sales.  The 20 best-selling console games.  We're not going through the 20, obviously, but the number one, according to this list, 
[00:38:00]  is Pokemon Red, Blue, and Green.  Oh, Pokemon.  That's the top-selling console game.  Are they going worldwide?  Yeah.  Because that's Japan, right?  Uh, yeah.  Just stop it.  Those Japanese are into some weird-ass games.  Yeah, you're right, actually.  Just weird.  Japan did about $10 million.  You ever play Tub Girl for PlayStation?  That's a fun one.  I played the home version.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey to Max.  What's up?  Got a couple quick fun facts for you.  I used to date a girl that was a mortician.  And he told me whenever they embalm a person, they have to superglue all the orifices or  you'll just like, uh, stuff will just go spraying all over the place.  Oh, and they fill you up with formaldehyde?  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  And, uh, the other fun fact is, and I don't know how to say this for regular radio, so  we'll say the male deceased person.  Yeah.  Yeah, they gotta, uh, hold on, I gotcha.  They gotta kinda, um, uh, they just gotta pat down the body.  Let's just put it that way.  Exactly.  And, uh, she was telling me that and it just totally skeeved me out.  Pat it down.  Pat it down so nothing, let's just say nothing, uh, happens that would happen when you wake  up in the morning?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  How great would that be at the wake? 
[00:39:30]  Grandma comes over.  Ooh.  Oh, when you embalm a guy, I guess the embalming fluid goes everywhere, including certain chambers  in certain, uh, places that normally, uh, fill up with blood.  And, uh, uh, and, and that then causes, would you stop?  No way.  I want an expert.  Or it might be when you die, because, like, your nails continue to grow, your hair grows.  I think that's a problem.  You do go, you evacuate, uh, sometimes when you die, like, your body voids, I think.  So, I don't know, it could be one of those weird things. 
[00:40:00]  Well, now we gotta find out.  You know, hang out today.  We gotta find out if that's true, if, uh, if the mortician has to pat down the, uh, male  bodies.  Yes.  Like a, like a balloon animal.  You gotta squeeze the balloon.  And it, whoop, it blows up somewhere else.  Yeah, he's gotta squeeze.  All of a sudden, the toes get, like, fatter.  All right, perfect.  Tie him off.  Let's go to Brian in New York.  Brian, what's up?  I like to make werewolf movies.  I am the werewolf. 
[00:40:30]  Yes, you are.  Good boy.  I caught Kid Nation last night, man, it was so hysterical.  I had a couple things I always wanted to tell you.  Yeah.  One part was, uh, uh, they, they were all hungry, they needed food, so they decided that  they were gonna kill chickens.  And the one, uh, the one black fellow stood up and says, I want chicken.  And he was all happy everybody else didn't want chicken.  And, uh, then I remembered a little, a little fat girl. 
[00:41:00]  She says, I don't want to kill any chickens.  It looked like she'd never eaten chicken in her life.  She's about 100 pounds, about eight years old.  I thought it was hysterical.  And then, and then one last one was that little girl, a little skinny girl, so it was like  a little anorexic four-year-old.  She started mouthing off at the lip, and this one boy stood up and says, shut your disrespectful  little mouth.  Yeah, she, I laughed so hard last night, so it was so funny.  That's all I got, boys.  Have a good day.  Well, she's a 10-year-old beauty queen, and she, you can tell she's gonna be a you-know-what 
[00:41:30]  already.  Her personality's already completely set for the rest of her life.  Yeah.  And she's only 10, she's a beauty queen, and she's got an attitude, and she's like, I  don't do dishes.  Yeah.  We're the youngest, so we, we don't have to be able to cook right.  You, you saw Kid Nation last night?  Yes, I finally watched it.  I can't get enough of that dumb show.  I can't open my ass off.  I was just thinking.  Because it's, it's insane, and unfortunately, it's on CBS.  I, I gotta be honest with you.  I, I wish another, like, channel, you know, grabbed it, because they wouldn't have a cute 
[00:42:00]  host.  You, I, I don't mean cute in the, you know, just that, like, I don't, I don't mean it  like that.  You just put your foot so deeply in your mouth.  But, I mean, that just, like, that cutesy host where everything is all cool.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, he's protecting everybody.  Like, I just wish it was on a different channel, because, uh, the killing of the food would  be a little different.  Like, last night they had a, they had a, you know, uh, kill a couple chickens to, to get  protein into these little, little effers mouths so they could survive. 
[00:42:30]  Like, and they just did it in such a, like, kind of almost like a cutesy way.  You know what I mean?  It's, uh, yeah, it's not brutal enough.  It really isn't brutal enough.  They, they're supposed to be kids, and they're on their own, in this frontier-type atmosphere,  this frontier-town atmosphere.  And, uh, yeah, they're, they're giving a little too much.  Right.  Uh, it's not, it's not shocking enough.  That kid, that, that little fat kid that, uh, that guy was talking about was hysterical.  Went into the chicken cage.  Yeah, just to explain.  So the guy had killed the chickens, and she, she just didn't want that to happen. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  So she's, uh, she's standing in the chicken cage.  Kids are stupid, though.  That's, that's all I concluded from that show.  I'm watching, just going, they're really dumb.  They're excited about a water slide.  Right.  Like, if they finish this project with these pipes that they had to put together, leading  from point A to point B, all these various fittings and elbows and pipes to run water from,  uh, a source to a water wheel. 
[00:43:30]  Um, and then they get to win a water slide in the middle of the street in the town.  It's like, ugh, kids are stupid.  How about, but in a kid's-  How about something better than a water slide?  Yeah, but in a kid's world, that's, that's the best thing you could ever, ever have.  That's why I'm like, kids are stupid.  You know?  I'm just saying in general that this show's like too, I don't know.  It's too, it's kind of cutesy.  You know, I was expecting more like, uh, Lord of the Flies type of situation. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  And it's kind of, it's kind of funny.  You watch some of the kids and they're just like, well, we went out and we got to put the pipes together.  And they're little kids.  But then there's these other kids that are kind of, uh, yeah, uh, well, I was, I, I did some plumbing with my father.  That's one kid's talking about how he could put the pipes together because he did plumbing work.  Yeah, he's a day away.  He's like 25 or something.  You're, you're a hundred percent right.  Some of the kids are a day away from puberty.  Literally.  Just, yeah, waking up and having a full beard.  Yeah, one guy, one kid, guy, one kid's like 15 and he's hanging out with eight year old girls. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, it's, it's like, I don't know what's going on with that show.  I haven't figured it out yet, but, uh, I'll keep watching.  Oh God, enough of this crap.  Steven Brooklyn, what's up?  Hey, I'm a little bit, Eli.  Um, I have a fun fact for you specifically.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I went to you.  Go ahead.  Yeah, there are two S's in the word asterisk.  Okay.  And actually the fun is for the rest of us listening to you try to pronounce it correctly or refusing to. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, asterisk.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Are you done?  I'm done.  All right, there you go.  Uh, before we go to break, we got to let you know about cashforgold.com.  Ah, sweet.  Lust for life.  Come on.  Can we just listen to this song for a while?  Royal Caribbean commercial.  Yeah, they wrecked this song.  You're right.  You hear this constantly on the, uh, ship too when you're. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, really?  Royal Caribbean cruise, yeah.  But you're like, you know, you go through the TV and they have the, uh, the closed circuit  cruise channels and this song's playing and you're all psyched.  I'm going to go climb the rock wall.  I'm psyched.  But you end up at the bar instead.  Uh, you know, there's a lot of, a lot of bars in between your room and the rock wall.  You're right.  It's an obstacle course.  Frozen banana drinks.  Half the battle's getting to the rock wall without stopping at a bar, right? 
[00:46:00]  God, that is so true.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Why are monks running around all over the world?  There's like 70,000 of them in the streets of landmark.  Who gives a crap?  What?  There, uh, there's always some government that wants to crack down on the monks.  What's wrong with the monks?  But they're all angry at the monks because they don't, uh, I don't know, they don't conform  to, uh, the government's, uh, rules and regulations.  It was the monks alone.  The monks.  Wouldn't you not mind if monks were crossing the border to get into the United States to 
[00:46:30]  escape oppression?  Of course not.  They're just monks.  Yeah.  They'd brew beer.  It would be a lot quieter in your neighborhood.  It'd be very quiet.  They don't like to speak.  No, they don't talk.  They just sit there.  All right.  And occasionally burn themselves up with gasoline.  Can I get, you know, uh...  Problem?  Problem?  Yes.  Chad in Chicago.  Chad.  Yeah.  Hey, Chad.  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to ask Opie, um, who do you think might not be as cute as, uh, hosts 
[00:47:00]  from Kid Nation that might, you know, not distract you so much?  All right.  Let's just get this over with.  He's pumping that out.  Let's just get this over with.  Throw me in the barrel.  Let's have fun for the next 20 minutes.  I used the wrong word.  I just meant the whole show in general is put together in a cutesy way.  They, uh, whatever.  I can't explain myself.  No, there's no explaining it.  You called the host cute.  Right.  And you got called on it.  Actually.  It happened.  Actually, he's not my type.  I'd rather go with, like, Brad Pitt. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  I saw, like, last night during the show, too, a girl went up and hugged him.  Yeah.  And he kind of, like, like, touched her head and brushed her hair a little bit and then  sent her away.  It's the creep.  That's kind of creepy to me.  Look, I'm F today.  I understand.  I didn't mean cute in that way.  It's just like, it's a cutesy shit.  Ah, forget it.  I can't explain my story.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I think Chris Hansen should host that show, to be honest with you.  Uh, soap opera.  Or you want to do politics. 
[00:48:00]  We got two really good things we got to get to here.  Well, the soap opera thing's pretty quick because I was just, uh, I was, I was napping.  I have to, when I go home, sometimes I have to nap, uh, before I go to the gym because  I'm very tired from waking up so early.  So I'm taking my little nappy, uh, and, uh, I wake up before the alarm goes off.  So I got a little time to lay there and I look at the TV and there's a soap opera on  because the TV's on with the volume off.  Well, something about Anthony, you can't sleep if the TV's off, right? 
[00:48:30]  Well, I just like having the TV on.  But even when you're sleeping for the night, you have to keep the TV on the whole night,  right?  Well, yeah.  Last night I put on, uh, one of the music channels that, uh, you know, the cable system  has.  Do you sleep with like the, with noise in the room?  Yeah.  TV on.  He has to have the TV on.  This is something we've known for years.  I gotta have the TV on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  Are you scared?  I'm very scared of the dark.  No, I'm not scared.  I just, I, I don't like, um, being left to my own thoughts sometimes.  I like kind of distractions.  But doesn't that, like, doesn't that keep you awake here? 
[00:49:00]  No, not at all.  What'll keep me awake is if it's dead silent, I will sit there and think about stuff all  night long.  And I'm not talking about like bad stuff or anything like that.  Just stuff.  I'll think about, what do I want to do?  And then your mind just goes off and, and all of a sudden you're thinking of creative ideas,  things you might want to do for the show, things I might want to videotape.  QTV hosts.  You know, QTV hosts, things like that.  And then I look at the clock and realize I've been there just thinking for hours. 
[00:49:30]  So if I put a stupid show on, that's just, you know, dull or, or even a good movie, something  like that, I'll fall asleep watching that.  But now I put on the music channels.  Like I got done last night watching the war, which is that Ken Burns, uh, documentary on  World War II.  It is fan effing tastic.  Has the guy ever done anything bad?  I didn't like the baseball one cause I don't know.  I didn't like that one.  The civil war one was amazing.  And this one about World War II is unbelievable. 
[00:50:00]  Fantastic.  It's on, uh, your public, uh, television network, uh, wherever you're from.  And it's amazing.  I highly suggest it.  Okay.  Uh, so I was watching that.  It ended at about 1230 and I had to go to sleep.  So I put on the music channel and just went to sleep to that.  See, I used to try doing that, like get the real trippy, like music channels.  Yeah.  And then they always have to play a song in the mix that wakes you up.  Like something that's a little too loud with gongs or something that wakes you up from 
[00:50:30]  your, your sleep.  Oh yeah.  You got to watch out what kind of music you put on.  Well, but they need to have the music all on the same level.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Knowing that some people will use this as background music to take a nap or fall asleep.  I turn it way down too.  So even if something gets loud, it's not going to get too loud.  I turn it way down and, uh, that brought it up.  He goes, that's funny.  You put on the TV so that you won't get ideas for the show.  Yeah.  I don't want to think too much about like the show or stuff like that.  Now I'm trying to go to sleep, but, uh, I had to go to the gym, so I napped and then 
[00:51:00]  I woke up before the alarm.  So I'm laying there and a soap opera is on channel two because the TV was just left on  and then it was on channel two and, uh, I don't know what it was.  Couldn't tell you.  I guess it was before three o'clock.  It was in the two o'clock hour on channel two, whatever soap that is.  So I'm, I'm kind of got one eye open and there are two guys that are kind of like this  OC looking trendy guys, uh, in their early twenties, I guess, uh, in this room and they're 
[00:51:30]  talking in this big soap opera type mansion that everyone seems to have.  And, uh, they're talking about something and I'm just kind of looking and, and then they  start out of nowhere making out.  They just started open mouth kissing on this soap opera.  And I'm like, what the hell am I watching?  And then, uh, the door opens to this room they're in.  Yeah.  And what appears to be, and what I can only guess was one of their fathers walked in the 
[00:52:00]  room and just made this shocked face, this soap opera shock face.  And then it faded to the commercial.  And that was the end of the show for the, for the day.  He didn't do the butthead.  No, he was just, he was shocked and horrified and dude, they went back to the guys who are  just open mouth, like, like passion kissing, deep kissing.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be as you're kissing one to feel his man hands 
[00:52:30]  holding your head like the sweat of a man hand right on the nape of your neck, kind of holding  it and then gently scraping his fingers along the back of your scalp.  Oh my God.  And then, and then noise a man would make when he was kissing you would be, that is  so free smelling that old spice would be worse.  High karate would be worse.  The man kissing you or when he held your face in his hands and gently just licked your lips  in a teasing fashion.  Ah, well, uh, Iraq, it's called all my children. 
[00:53:00]  The soap opera and the one I disowned.  Oh, I thought that was the name of the guy's favorite beverage.  So, uh, the father walks in to see this mess.  Yeah, I gather it's the father.  I don't know.  He made a shocked look.  Yeah.  And then they faded, went to commercial and when they came back, it was the end of the  show.  So they left with a big cliffhanger.  Well, the problem is, so I don't know what, uh, that's how I was left. 
[00:53:30]  That and a little plump.  That was the music they should have played when the father was at the door.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, son, I...  I thought you were supposed to be at football practice, boy.  I...  Oh, my God, you're a...  You like...  And you're...  You...  His... 
[00:54:00]  Didn't you?  Your...  Smells like...  Doesn't it?  Oh, boy.  Uh, well, you could watch the show a year from now and then finally they'll tell you what  that's all about.  I'll find out what...  Stupid soap operas.  I'll find out what happened.  Hey, uh, also, you, uh, watched the Democratic, uh, debate last night?  Yeah, I was, uh, trolling around through the channels and I see the debates on, so I figure  I'll catch a little bit of it.  You don't gotta...  You don't have to watch all the debate. 
[00:54:30]  You gotta watch about 20 minutes of it and then you know everything.  You're better than me because I, uh, was flipping through and I saw that I stopped.  I'm like, all right, I'm gonna watch this a little bit.  After two minutes, I'm like, nothing's gonna get accomplished here.  No one's gonna answer any questions.  It's just a complete waste of time.  It's all the same agenda, the same stuff, the same answers.  They're all kind of afraid to, uh, rock the boat, especially this early on in the whole  thing.  Uh, but it's really, it's the first, uh, foray I've made into watching any of these debates 
[00:55:00]  and kind of seeing what the candidates are about.  I figure it's time, you know, start taking a look.  And, um, the Democrats are screwed.  Screwed.  They had the perfect opportunity to get a candidate in there that, uh, you know, somebody  like Bill Clinton in a way where maybe he comes out of nowhere, got some experience,  uh, some, uh, novel, original ideas, some sincerity, uh, you know, charismatic kind of 
[00:55:30]  a thing.  Yeah, but you never know.  I mean, no one really knew Clinton.  Yeah, but from what I came out of nowhere, from what I saw, one of these guys comes out  of nowhere, but there's no real new guy.  Ah, Mike Gravel.  No, no.  Dude, I didn't even know.  All right.  I didn't even know some of these guys are in there.  There's the old crazy guy and that's him.  Mike Gravel?  Yeah.  He's old crazy guy.  I didn't even know about this guy until you talked about him, uh, this morning.  I can't get enough of Mike Gravel now. 
[00:56:00]  Then there's old guy with a part that looks like he parted it with a, um, a beard, uh,  shaver.  Okay.  He's doing something where he's got a part that's about three inches wide.  Yeah.  Uh, then Joe Biden, uh, he seems all right.  You've seen him around for years, so he kind of knows how to work these, these debates.  Um, he gives some straight answers, which was refreshing to see.  Uh, Obama, uh, from what I saw, his inexperience comes through when he doesn't have a written 
[00:56:30]  speech in front of him when he delivered, um, uh, uh, the keynote speech, I guess he  was amazed, uh, charisma.  Yeah.  He really got the attention.  Very charismatic.  That kind of was his coming out party.  There is debutante ball.  And, um, when he's just standing there answering questions, he's very, it's not the same robotic.  Uh, he doesn't come off as, as sincere as he does when he's got a prepared speech.  Hillary is just the C word.  She's terrible. 
[00:57:00]  She is the C word.  That's all that comes across when she's there.  She doesn't, there's no warmth to her.  There's no personality to her there.  And, and believe me, she could have some of the best ideas ever, but wrapped up in that  package, they don't come across well.  And that pantsuit.  It's horrid.  The only woman I would want, I would feel more comfortable with is Condoleezza Rice.  I don't know why she doesn't annoy me, but she does it.  Like her, I would, I could listen to.  There's something not phony or forced about it when she talks.  Yeah.  She's just like, yeah.  She's very natural when she's. 
[00:57:30]  She's not a phony.  Doing her thing.  Right.  And, um, I guess that Edwards is all right.  He kind of reminds me too much of Elo though.  He does.  I look at him and I just, there's something kind of about the way he looks and his hair  and his mannerisms.  He just reminds me of Elo.  And I can't in good conscience vote for Elo.  Why does John Edwards also sleep on a bar floor?  He was pulling out drinks from under his podium.  Let's get by the third question.  He's like, I don't care who you vote for.  He's trying to hide a straw behind the mic. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, uh, you gotta get to Mike Gravel though.  Uh, Snap Man's, uh, writing.  Guys, did you see the YouTube video with Mike Gravel where he stares at the camera and throws  a rock into a lake?  He's insane.  I think we're the last ones on board the Mike Gravel train here, man.  Well, I don't know.  I had no idea this guy was like out of his mind.  This guy is crazy.  I'm watching last night and two seconds into the first thing he said, I went, oh my God,  this guy's a nut.  Okay.  Oh, here's the, uh, here's Mike Gravel just staring into the camera on YouTube. 
[00:58:30]  Just put Mike Gravel rock into the search and you'll see this.  He's just staring into the camera.  This is the guy, huh?  Yeah.  He's, he's an old codger, uh, much too old to be elected president.  And he, he's just too old.  But he's on the same stage as Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Obama, Biden, Andy Rooney.  He, and he, he's crazy.  Right.  Well, we got a clip of Mike Gravel set this up here.  Uh, they were asking, and this was kind of good. 
[00:59:00]  The, uh, moderator was asking each candidate, potential, uh, presidential, uh, candidate what  the, uh, how they could possibly be president if they had made this mistake.  Okay.  And then they mentioned, uh, a mistake that they had made in their past or some kind of  bad policy they did or, uh, uh, your, the city they were in charge of going bankrupt.  Uh, this guy in his personal life had owned a business that went bankrupt and he, uh, 
[00:59:30]  bilked, um, some companies out of a lot of money by filing for bankruptcy.  And he kind of tries to explain it and it doesn't come off well.  Okay.  He actually gets some laughs.  Why is he throwing that rock in the water?  Because he's crazy.  I don't know.  It's a huge.  That was a kidney stone.  It's a huge rock.  He just throws into the lake, then walks away.  Does he say anything doing this?  And then, and then the graphic is Gravel 2008.  Do they think that this is going to make you think like this guy is different?  He's an ass.  He kept saying that all the other candidates were in fantasy land. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  Because now you're, you're talking fantasy land again.  And everything that came out of his mouth was fantasy land.  He's just one of these candidates that just doesn't have a chance, but it'll be fun to  watch what he says and does from here on in.  You know, the other candidates are just like, oh my God, why do we have to share the stage  with this guy?  He's a kook.  Well, this is what he had to say last night.  Uh, and just did the fine set up there.  I want to ask Senator Gravel, you about running for president of the United States.  In 1980, your condo business went bankrupt. 
[01:00:30]  Correct.  In 2004, you filed for personal bankruptcy.  Correct.  Uh, leaving $85,000 in credit bills unpaid.  How can someone who did not take care of his business, could not manage his own personal  finances, say that he's capable of managing the country?  Well, first off, if you want to make a judgment of who can be the greediest people in the world  when they get to public office, you can just look at the people up here.  Many of them done very, very well in public office.  I left the Senate no better than when I went in. 
[01:01:00]  Now, you say, the condo business, I'll tell you, Donald Trump has been bankrupt a hundred  times.  So I went bankrupt once in business.  And the other, who did I bankrupt?  I stuck the credit card companies with $90,000 worth of bills, and they deserved it because  I used the money.  They deserved it.  And I used the money to finance the empowerment of the American people with a national initiative  so you can make the laws.  Now, Tim, let me just point one thing out.  You're asking about special interest. 
[01:01:30]  You've made your point.  You've made your point.  Well, I wanted to make a better point.  This guy rules.  I wanted to make a better point.  And he's just laughing.  He goes, no, you made your point.  You're crazy.  It's pretty much what he said.  He goes, you made your point.  You're a nut.  Yeah.  I stuck him.  That's right.  They deserved it.  Wow.  That's what you want to hear from that.  He has stuck the credit card companies because they deserved it.  You could be assassinated for saying something like that.  And he's like, I want to make a better point. 
[01:02:00]  I didn't like the one I made.  Let's get to the other clip.  Tim, let me just point one thing out.  You're asking about special interest.  You've made your point.  You've made your point.  Well, I wanted to make a better point.  I won't believe it at that because I've got to give everyone a chance.  Oh, wow.  He's hysterical.  He is on our radar.  Tim Russert sucks.  He's a little teeny, beady, stupid bug eyes.  But this guy rules.  Yeah, this guy is going to be really funny to watch.  I want to make a better point.  He's insane.  Oh, that's terrific. 
[01:02:30]  I want to register Democrat and vote for Mike Gravel.  You just want him?  Gravel.  Gravel, right.  It's Gravel.  Yeah, it is Gravel.  I want to defraud the system and vote for him repeatedly.  I would love to have him as president.  Talk about shaking some stuff up.  Hey, when you hear Mike Gravel or whatever, you got to think Dick Stockton from back in  the day.  Oh, was that him?  Can we get some old Dick Stockton clips?  If I'll tell you something, we might have to start, get our, the Opie and Anthony show's 
[01:03:00]  endorsement, presidential endorsement.  I know it's a little early, but people are starting to endorse some of the candidates.  Perhaps Mike Gravel is going to be our candidate.  We haven't been excited about politics since Paul R. Nelson.  We got right behind Paul R. Nelson.  So now we got a new guy, Mike Gravel.  Mike Gravel.  In 08.  How was Hillary?  Her face.  She just started laughing, right?  She started laughing.  Everyone was laughing at this guy.  And at one point earlier in the debate, Mike Gravel turns to Hillary and starts lambasting 
[01:03:30]  her on some issues.  And she's looking at him with this smirk and this face that you can only imagine she had  on when Bill told her about the affair.  Yes.  Like just you son of a bitch.  And just the sea, the sea face she had on.  She's a very remarkably unlikable person.  Unlikable.  And I don't like when people say, well, she's a powerful woman.  I have no problem with a brilliant power. 
[01:04:00]  And she is brilliant.  But I just don't like her.  And I don't know why.  Maybe because she got into her husband.  Maybe that's why she came up.  I don't like her because you don't know what her husband does.  I don't like her because there's no honesty there.  She's a funny.  That's another thing.  Exactly.  She can't answer a question.  Even when they asked her what her favorite baseball team is, she couldn't even do that  right.  Last night they asked her.  Like Giuliani openly says, I'm a Yankees fan.  And you know what?  But Mets fans in New York respected the fact that he answered the question.  He's like, this is what I'm into.  And with Hillary, what was it? 
[01:04:30]  She liked the Cubs.  But she also liked the Yankees.  Oh, she had a different hat on at any stadium she'd be in.  She put that hat on.  Yeah, it was just like, just freaking answer a question.  Because she thinks that people, she's such a dummy.  And she's so not in touch with the way sports people really are.  Her view is that, well, men are so dumb with their sports.  They'll like me better if they think.  No one cares.  No one cares, frosted mullet, fat neck.  No one cares.  They asked her.  They were doing another fat montage on TV.  They asked her, look, if Israel felt threatened by Iran's nuclear capability, would you support 
[01:05:00]  our ally, Israel, in a preemptive strike against Iran's facilities to build nuclear weapons?  And she wouldn't answer the question.  Of course she would.  She said, I will not go into hypothetical situations.  He goes, no, it's not a hypothetical situation.  I'm saying, would you support Israel if this were to happen? 
[01:05:30]  She would not answer the goddamn question.  She sucks.  And the Democrats are going to wind up nominating her.  Because she's probably, they say she's a great fundraiser.  Like, I'm reading about it a lot.  And they say she's a brilliant fundraiser.  She's going to get the nomination.  And then, she might, I don't know, the more, like, they also asked her about these safe  havens for illegal immigrants.  There are certain cities that are going to be safe havens where the police aren't allowed  to barge in and arrest illegal immigrants. 
[01:06:00]  You're kidding, right?  I'm not kidding.  There has to be some kind of an INS presence.  You can't just say to the, call the police and go, there is a house full of illegal immigrants  and have them go bust them.  They're called safe havens.  And it's completely against the law.  They would be breaking the law, actually harboring these people, the cities themselves.  So, they asked the candidates, would you support these cities being safe havens for immigrants?  And again, she goes on and on to where I'm sitting there going, she's twisting this all 
[01:06:30]  around.  And he's telling her, answer the question.  And she just goes on and on.  And they ask, like, Biden?  And Biden goes, no, I don't support it.  And I was like, oh, wait a minute.  I had to rewind.  I had to rewind.  It's like, wait, someone actually answered the question?  Was that a straight, honest answer?  That's all you want from your politician.  Just give me a goddamn answer.  Ask the effing question.  When they ask him one thing and then they turn, like, they ask about the war and then  they spin it and all of a sudden she's talking about healthcare. 
[01:07:00]  Universal healthcare.  It's like, wait a minute.  What'd you do?  What'd you do?  You were asked the question.  It's phony.  It's not honest.  Right.  And that's why people don't like her.  When we come back, do we have any Hillary audio?  I just have to get a little bit.  Well, actually, we got some, it's not Dick, it's James Stockdale, right?  Or, huh?  James Stockdale.  Admiral James Stockdale.  Admiral.  Oh, it was always Admiral.  That's why.  I never remembered his first name either.  And we'll try to get a Hillary clip.  And if we're going to talk politics, because it is the O.P. and Anthony show, they debated politics 
[01:07:30]  on Beauty and the Geek with these bimbos.  Oh, no, great.  We got some highlights that are really, really, really funny.  And then the biggest bimbo of all, our president, and what he said last night, that was really  good, too.  So we'll continue with politics for a little bit here.  Bill Burr joining the program.  Also, later this morning, we got, oh, Sandy Kane's coming in today.  And Carrot Top.  And Carrot Top will be stopping by to say hi.  But him and Bill Burr can't be in the same room together, or they'll explode like matter  and anti-matter. 
[01:08:00]  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hello.  Hello, hello, hello.  I haven't heard that one in a while.  Hello.  I like that one.  Sometimes listeners do that.  Fall off and say.  Hello.  All right, a little reset here.  PD's like when you're reset. 
[01:08:30]  O.P. and Anthony's show, phone number, 877-212-ONA, instant feedback, you get there through our  website, you got the PalTalk cameras, people are watching us do the radio show.  And we're watching them.  And we're in the middle of kind of talking about politics.  A little bit, a little bit.  Changing gears a little bit.  Who watches Beauty and the Geek?  I have not caught it this season, but I have listened to the sound clips on the O.P. 
[01:09:00]  and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I don't have to watch a lot of these shows.  No, we'll give you the easy version.  Yeah, speaking of resetting, exactly.  This is like, you know, we watch all the shows for you and then we bring the better clips  to your radio dial just to sleep all day and night and then just wake up for this show  and we'll fill you in with everything you need to know and then go back to sleep.  Yeah, one of our jobs is just to be in touch with pop culture and the TV shows and the 
[01:09:30]  movies and the video games and the politics and the top news stories and the sports teams.  F-ing Phillies.  We should live your life for you.  F-ing Phillies, I said it.  Ooh, what happened?  Giving the Mets a bit of a problem.  Wow.  And I was thinking about...  The Mets are a lot...  Oh, I know they're joking.  I was thinking about something.  I just want to state it for everybody out there.  You know how we were talking about Hillary and how she can't answer a stupid question?  Yes. 
[01:10:00]  And that's really frustrating because what the politicians are trying to do, they don't  want to, you know, block anyone from voting for them, right?  Yep.  Because if you're for abortion and your candidate is against it, you're going to be like,  well, I can't vote for that candidate.  Yeah.  And that's well and good if there's one or two topics, but they do it for everything  to the point where it's like, I don't want to vote for this person because they don't  answer anything.  Because they won't answer anything because, yeah, just like you said, they're afraid they're  going to alienate a part of the population.  So they just don't answer it. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  And I guess this started pretty much with the abortion issue, but then it led into what  they think of Israel.  What do they think of illegal immigration?  And they just added so many of these tough questions that these politicians, like, don't answer  them.  So then you as the voter, it's like, why am I even bothering?  Yeah.  You don't know what the candidate stands for because they won't talk about it.  And I appreciate a candidate that just answers the questions and is a bit honest.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:11:00]  They should have a yes and no session where you're forced to answer.  How great would that be?  Yes and no.  All right.  And the questions have to be designed.  They have to, because obviously there's circumstances.  Right.  So they have to kind of be specific questions.  Hillary would go, yo.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Stupid cream pantsuit.  But the point I'm going to make here is we make it very obvious what sports teams  we're into.  Mm-hmm.  A little different.  I understand. 
[01:11:30]  Did the big buildup here.  But, like, Anthony is a huge Yankees fan.  Yeah.  I'm a Mets fan.  Yankees.  But I want the Red Sox over the Yankees.  That is the truth from, I guess, my days in Boston.  See, that's crazy because I'm a Yankee fan.  But I would definitely take the Mets over the Red Sox.  Well, no.  I want the Mets in the long run.  Yeah, I know.  But you would take Boston over the Yankees.  Yeah, because I don't want to.  See, that's stupid.  I hate the Yankees.  I don't like that.  If you're a Mets fan, you hate the Yankees.  I'm a New Yorker to the point. 
[01:12:00]  I would definitely take Mets over the Sox, even though I'm a Yankee fan.  Well, when you do a Cinecate radio show, consultants will tell you, you know, why don't you keep  a little vague what you're into as far as sports teams go and stuff?  Because you don't want to alienate, like, the Boston people that are listening to us  right now.  And I think fans of this radio show appreciate the fact that we're honest about who we like  and we're not trying to, like, make believe we sort of like the Red Sox, but sort of like,  you know, the Cubs, but sort of like the Phillies.  You know what I mean?  Like when we used to take pictures of us in every jersey from every market we were 
[01:12:30]  in and send it to that station?  Yeah, but we even went on the air and said, look.  I know.  You know, Chicago sent us some Bulls jerseys.  We were going to pose them for the website.  We're in Detroit.  Let's say this.  I hope Detroit's having a huge year.  I hope the Tigers bus flips over.  Wow.  Isn't very nice.  I hope so.  Right into an embankment and all the pitchers' arms break.  And the Tigers are having a great year, but we're not going to fake it.  Like, I couldn't talk about the Tigers. 
[01:13:00]  At all.  So, eh, whatever.  But people think that if you're making people laugh, they're not going to care what team  you're rooting for.  Yeah, who cares?  People, they underestimate, they think guys are that stupid that, like, they won't listen  to something that's funny because we don't like the Red Sox.  Don't like my team.  Can't listen.  Yeah.  I like to make a movie.  I am the werewolf.  I like turtles.  Oh, shut up.  About the turtles.  Also on in Florida. 
[01:13:30]  I hope the Marlins, I hope they're having a practice and the stadium door catches on fire  and as they're all escaping, they burn running through us.  And the Delarays are trying to help them and they burn too.  What?  All 10 people that went to the game?  Have you seen the picture?  Awful.  Have you seen that picture?  Yeah.  Awful.  It's great.  Was it the Marlins?  It was the Marlins, right?  They were playing a home game?  The empty stadium?  The Marlins against the Nationals.  There is a picture.  If you haven't seen it yet, maybe we could turn some people on to the picture. 
[01:14:00]  No one gives a crap game.  It's in the middle of the game.  It was so effing hot that there was no one in the stadium.  They all just either didn't go to the game to begin with or left.  We're also on in Washington.  Oh, yes.  We're on in D.C.  And the Nationals.  They're a triple A team.  We all know that.  Of course they are.  They just threw them a bone and let them play in the majors for a few years.  And I hope, I don't know how it would happen, but I hope they're all in the locker room  and there's a building collapse and they have to pull them from the rubble with filthy,  torn uniforms.  Some loving, some living, some not so loving. 
[01:14:30]  And jock straps.  Yes, jock straps and torn uniforms.  And tears.  Like they're dirty, stained faces.  That looks like a picture of a stadium.  Yeah.  Like where you get an empty stadium and take a picture.  That is it.  Right.  And they show, you know, the first few.  You put it up on your wall as art.  That's not the one I saw, by the way.  I saw another one where.  There's less people.  You couldn't count a hundred people in the stadium during a Marlins game.  It was taken from behind home plate, like that angle. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, that's what I think.  I think this is it.  Look at this.  I know it's radio, but we'll turn you on to the picture.  Look.  Look at this.  You can't count a hundred people in that stadium and they swear this was during a Marlins home game.  And I bet if you went to walk up to the front, some creep security guard would still stop you.  No, let me see your ticket.  Yeah, because he wants, you know, he wants a little action in his hand there.  Wow.  I think it was in the Washington Post.  Yeah, the Washington Post printed this picture.  This is an actual picture of a Marlins home game.  And as you look at this picture, you can't count a hundred people in the stadium. 
[01:15:30]  It's a picture from way above looking at the entire stadium.  And listen, we shouldn't alienate the city.  Chicago is the city we're on in.  We love Chicago.  Yep.  I hope the White Sox and the Cubbies all get food poisoning.  Bad food poisoning.  Like, almost like we don't know if they're going to live or not.  Dude, you're going to kill us in these cities.  I don't mean to.  Oh, my God.  Hey, we're on in Philly.  We have big eagles.  Yeah.  Eagles.  Every leg on the team should be broken in one avoidable accident. 
[01:16:00]  Like, one thing that they could have avoided.  Easily avoidable.  But they didn't.  And all of their legs are broken.  But that's what a radio consultant will do.  They'll sit you down and go, look, you know, don't alienate, you know, the city by,  by not acknowledging that you, you, you, you just keep it very, very vague.  You blur it a little bit.  Yeah.  And so they think maybe, maybe they're, they are Eagles fans.  I think that's kind of dishonest.  And nobody cares.  Like, the people don't, it's not 1978 anymore. 
[01:16:30]  The people just don't.  I think it's more fun if we're like, if Anthony's talking about the Yankees.  And then next thing you know, we got a bunch of phone calls from Red Sox fans beating up  Anthony.  Well, let me tell you.  And Anthony's taking on the whole city.  They enjoyed that fact a few years back.  2003.  That's for sure.  2003.  Yeah.  They, they really enjoyed the fact that I was a Yankee fan.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  We weren't on in 2003.  No.  2004.  2004.  2004, probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to forget that year, too.  Yeah.  Believe me.  But sure.  But it makes...  Oh, we got this one in the bag. 
[01:17:00]  Oops.  I think it makes for a good radio.  Yeah.  Just tell it like it is, or at least attempt to.  Beauty and the Geek.  So the beauties had a little political debate, just like we were talking about with Hillary  and the rest of the candidates last night, right?  Mm-hmm.  And you got two beauties debating over minimum wage right here.  Oh, big issue.  Okay.  Yes.  Well, they must have been very intelligent, their answers.  Your topic is, should the federal minimum wage be raised?  I used to make minimum wage working. 
[01:17:30]  At a retail store, actually, and it wasn't fair.  It wasn't cutting my bills, and I was with my parents.  I disagree.  We don't need for the people to have poor money.  The way that they are now should be the way that they should be, and we should definitely  not hire them.  Not hire them?  What?  Who are them? 
[01:18:00]  Oh.  Or live next to them.  How dumb are these broads?  Very.  It's amazing how dumb they are.  By the way, a lot of Washington Nationals fans checking in on instant feedback.  Hey, Opie, that AAA team kicked the S out of your Mets.  Ah.  Coming in from Shaggy.  See?  It's coming in a lot.  Actually, the Nationals did sweep the Mets recently, so.  Of course they did.  They're good with brooms, cleaning queers. 
[01:18:30]  More beauty and the geek debate here.  Here, they debate over marijuana.  Ooh.  Should it be legalized?  You know the deal.  Your topic is, should marijuana be decriminalized?  30 million Americans have smoked marijuana.  And they didn't die or anything, and they're fine.  And so, they should definitely legalize it. 
[01:19:00]  Drug dealers out there make a living selling marijuana.  If we legalize marijuana, these drug dealers no longer have a source of income.  And see, this is the part of the show, by the way, because I'm a little suspicious.  Like, these girls get on the show, and, you know, they're going through the interviewing process.  They got to make sure the producers realize they're really stupid. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  So, I think they overdo the stupidity to get on the show.  But now that they're on the show, it's really important to show how smart you actually are to stay on the show.  And that's what they're doing here?  Yes.  Yes.  Another one debating over the drilling of oil in Alaska.  Oh.  Should the U.S. drill for oil in Anmar?  I stand firmly on drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  We cannot have cars running on canola oil or whatever, you know, hippies think we can run cars on. 
[01:20:00]  Oil is very important, and the Arctic has plenty full.  Plenty full?  But they're adorable.  Adorable dopes.  You've got to love it.  Here's the rebuttal.  Your rebuttal.  No, I do not believe we should be drilling. 
[01:20:30]  One, we don't know how much oil there is.  And along with it gives jobs.  It has very low gas.  Everything is estimated.  And we could have less oil than we actually could go through in just a few years.  Whoa.  My head's spinning.  What do you got there?  Good answer.  Yeah, good answer. 
[01:21:00]  They start reciting half a fact for the other side in the middle of their answer.  She has no idea.  And they're allowed to study the topics beforehand.  They pretty much know what they're going to debate on.  And then at the end of the show, they get to answer questions to stay on the show.  And this one floored me.  How many stars were on the official U.S. flag in January 1984? 
[01:21:30]  Stars?  13?  That is incorrect.  The correct answer is 50.  13.  Wow.  We sure built this nation quickly.  There you go.  Dopes.  I love it.  But they all look really hot.  As long as they're hot.  As they're sounding stupid.  Why should a hot girl have to be smart? 
[01:22:00]  See, I like a girl's mind.  I prefer a girl who's a little heavier, but has something to say.  Yeah, yeah.  One more clip from Beauty and the Geek.  Another dummy.  As yesterday's positive report card shows, children's do learn when standards are high  and results are measured.  What did he...  Can you please play that again?  Play it again.  If I've not heard that clip.  This is the President of the United States of America. 
[01:22:30]  As yesterday's positive report card shows, children's do learn when standards are high  and results are measured.  He sounds like the maid from Gone with the Wind.  Children's do learn.  Can you believe that?  Children's.  He didn't even say children's.  Children's.  Children's.  Children's.  Do learn.  Really?  Do they?  He speaks all the time, though.  He's going to mess up here and there, right?  How about not messing up here and there? 
[01:23:00]  That would be nice.  Not like that.  I can understand messing up here and there.  We all have the occasional verbal flub.  But then again, I'm not running the United States.  I'm a dumb shock jock.  Yeah.  You're not the most powerful man on the planet.  You don't control the button.  If you control the button, you should not pluralize air.  But children's do learn.  Children's do learn.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's great.  Like I said, the Democrats would have just had this wrapped up. 
[01:23:30]  Have they been able to come up with something better than a crazy man, a raging sea, and  a very inexperienced man who will appear to the more diverse?  I tell you, that stupid Hillary face.  You know who she looks like?  She looks like Phil Spector.  She's really starting to annoy me.  Phil Spector, a mistrial.  Yes.  All that.  A mistrial.  A mistrial.  Yeah.  It was 10 to 2.  10 people on the jury wanted him convicted on murder charges, and two just were holding 
[01:24:00]  out and saying, uh-uh.  So they declared it a mistrial.  Well, I was looking in on that on Court TV one day, and man, they really did a number.  That defense was amazing.  They really put the element of doubt out there that this woman may have just killed herself  in his house.  And that was it.  Well, is that to L.A., right?  Yeah.  And once again, the L.A. prosecution, they just suck. 
[01:24:30]  They are horrid when it comes to these high-profile celebrity cases.  It's terrible.  They cannot get the job done.  They can't close the deal.  It's, I think, I don't know if it's so much that they're to blame or that they're high-profile  cases.  These guys just have so much money to pay for these lawyers and stuff.  They get the best lawyers.  You can go in there and argue the case. 
[01:25:00]  It's just amazing.  This guy had blood all over him.  You know, it's a gun.  Guns in his hand.  Gunpowder on his face.  I mean, there's one thing I saw was he walked out.  Yeah.  He had the gun in his hand.  He walks out, and he's talking to a driver that had come to the house.  And he said something like, oh, God, I killed her.  Something to that effect.  And the lawyer was arguing that this guy misunderstood him. 
[01:25:30]  He meant someone's been killed.  He pretty much came out with the gun confessing he killed the girl.  But then they turned it around.  And since it was only him and her in there, his story of her committing suicide and the  prosecutors saying that it was murder, there's not really a...  Why do they think he killed her?  If he killed her, do they know what a motive would be? 
[01:26:00]  No.  That's why there was a mistrial.  They really don't have a motive.  They don't have anything except for the fact that he's kind of kooky.  He's had a violent past with women.  There are some weird blood splatters on his shirt that didn't quite jibe with him shooting  her, which kind of worked to his defense.  It's a weird case.  Yeah.  Right from the start when they arrested him with that hair.  I bet you Sandy Cain blew it when she's like, he raped me.  And the jury went, this couldn't be right. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to be here in minutes, Sandy Cain.  Cain?  Yeah.  Cain.  An old, uh...  She's an old, like, vaudevillian.  I don't know what she is.  She's an old burlesque woman.  Yeah.  She was in Times Square when Times Square was really seedy.  Yeah.  Back in the 70s, and she was a stripper there.  And she was part of the Phil Spector trial.  We'll get into that again after the break.  She was stripping when people just wore loincloth.  Old bag would strip while buffalo were running by. 
[01:27:00]  The guy's got the Hillary clip, by the way, that you were mentioning.  Oh, really?  You want to hear it real fast?  Yeah, let's hear the Hillary laugh.  Well...  Oh, it's not the laugh?  Oh, sorry.  This is her just deflecting the question about Iran and Israel.  Yeah.  Answer the goddamn question.  On September 6th, to the best of our information, Israel attacked Syria because there was suspicion  that perhaps North Korea had put some nuclear materials in Syria.  If Israel concluded that Iran's nuclear capability threatened Israel's security, would Israel be 
[01:27:30]  justified in launching an attack on Iran?  Well, Tim, I think that's one of those hypotheticals.  It's not a hypothetical.  That is better not addressed at this time.  It's real life.  What is real life is what apparently happened in Syria.  So let's take that one step at a time.  But my question...  I know what the question is, but I think it's important to lay out what we know about Syria  because we don't have as much information as I wish we did.  She doesn't care what the question is.  But what we think we know is that with North Korean help, both financial and technical and materiel, 
[01:28:00]  the Syrians apparently were putting together, and perhaps over some period of years, a nuclear facility.  Yeah, he mentioned this.  And the Israelis took it out.  I strongly support that.  We don't have any more information than what I have just described.  It is highly classified.  It is not being shared.  But I don't want to go a step further and talk about what might or might not happen down the road with Iran.  I'm not as awful on her with that question because she completely supported... 
[01:28:30]  She just said, I completely supported the attack on Syria.  Yeah, but she's skirting it so it doesn't bite her in her fat ass.  Probably right, but I mean, at least she supported it.  That one wasn't as bad as what she's done in the past.  Well...  Because she did say, I supported it.  Fuck me.  You want me to say?  It wasn't as bad.  She still didn't really answer the question, but it wasn't as bad.  Well, she said certain things are classified. 
[01:29:00]  That might just be doublespeak.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But it's like maybe it's really stupid to go, yes, I would.  Because that's...  I don't know.  Maybe that provokes Iran.  We could certainly get better examples of her just skirting the answers.  Have any politicians come right out and said we're going to attack?  Like that may be a rookie move or a bad move that Biden said...  Who knows?  Not attack, but just support them doing a preemptive strike, I guess.  It just seems to me like you'd kind of support that. 
[01:29:30]  I would.  I'd probably be the worst politician.  I just don't know the rules.  Maybe I'm just stupid.  I should not even comment.  No, you're...  I would be out there going, yes, bomb them.  And I actually...  I was last night.  Because my girlfriend walks in and she goes, what are you doing?  I said, I'm watching the debate.  And I just sit there and go, these Democrats are talking about like the war and Iran and this.  I go, they just talk about bombs.  They're all talking about diplomacy with mad people. 
[01:30:00]  Just bomb them.  I want bombs.  Bombs.  And as much as Tim Russert is a weasel who left Imus, I like the way he's going after these policies.  He doesn't really let them...  Screw Tim Russert.  Yeah, but he did that well.  I mean, he just jumped in and interrupted her.  And then she finally just...  He had to let it go because she blabbed.  But he did...  Was very firm with it.  He did all right.  Yeah.  I didn't...  Kevin in Florida, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, man.  And Mr. Norton.  Hello.  Hey, listen.  I called up a local radio station down here and I was telling him how much I think the 
[01:30:30]  ONA rules and all this stuff.  And he was telling me that the ratings down here in West Palm Beach absolutely suck.  And I said, I can't believe that because...  Wait, who would...  So you called the station and who would you talk to that said the ratings suck?  I believe he's...  I don't know what his job...  Maybe promotion, something like that.  Yeah, they don't really...  I'll be honest with you.  West Palm Beach really doesn't...  I don't know.  They don't like the show.  They don't really like the show because it's not local or it doesn't fit the rock image. 
[01:31:00]  They've been searching for a new morning show down in West Palm Beach for a really long  time.  That's a fact.  But the company...  I guess the company will allow us to be removed from the radio station when they find a...  We're just a placeholder.  Yeah.  Eventually, they're going to find another show they like and we're going to go to West Palm  Beach.  So what happened...  That's a fact.  I mean, I'm not surprised by your phone call.  You talked to someone at the station that we're on and they said our ratings absolutely 
[01:31:30]  suck.  How about the ratings for the station absolutely suck?  How about that?  How about we start there in West Palm Beach?  Should have got his name, sir.  But they wanted to replace us a really long time ago, but corporate won't allow them to  because the suggestions they have come up with, quite frankly, blow.  Yeah.  So we should call...  I guess Clear...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, go ahead, man.  Okay.  I was saying Clear Channel is going through a lot of changes down here and I guess they're  going to put some like the Lex and Terry and Bob and Tom on and... 
[01:32:00]  So are you guys going to stay where you are or is it...  I've been told that eventually we will not be on in West Palm Beach, Florida.  That eventually has been for about the past...  For a while.  ...like year.  Well, because they don't have their act together down there.  They really want to replace us, but they don't know what to replace us with.  From day one, when we were only on seven terrestrial stations, they kind of sent the  thing goes, no one wants the wow sticker.  So it was a problem kind of from day one and we addressed it on the air and it was just  this friction between the show and the station, unfortunately. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Well, we'll see what happens.  I mean, you know, when you syndicate a radio show, you win some and you lose some.  Some of the stations go away and then others pick you up, so I don't know what to tell  you.  I'd rather be on stations that really support the show and get it and know how to work  it.  So what happens, happens.  Whatever.  Well, it kind of sucks.  It pisses me off.  I just hope you guys stay where you are because I really, really...  I enjoy the show, man.  Well, when we were down there, we had some, you know, some fans showing up and it seemed  like people were doing the show. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, we had a good time.  I don't know.  Thanks.  All right, Kevin.  Yeah, thanks.  I went and saw Jimmy Norton.  He ruled down there.  I had a great time.  I went and saw you guys.  Of course he did.  Oh, thank you very much.  Of course.  Thanks, Kevin.  See you, bud.  I hope you stick around.  Yep.  Bye-bye.  Kevin listening in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Bill Burr next.  Stay there.  Yeah, we're back.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Bill Burr has joined the program.  Stress Factory, Bill?  Yes, I am.  I'm at the Stress Factory in New...  Beautiful downtown New Brunswick.  Yes.  You're there tonight through Saturday?  Yep.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 
[01:33:30]  One of my favorite clubs to go to and the man is in the booth over there, Vinny.  Let me give out the number real quick because it's...  It's terrific.  Yes, Jimmy.  We love it every time.  It's hard to remember, too.  I can't say it without laughing.  Yeah.  Because it's a comedy club.  It's 732-545...  Ha-ha.  You know, H-A-H-A.  Like laughs.  Ha-ha.  I can't believe that number was still available.  Yeah, no kidding.  I thought it would be at Sloan Kettering. 
[01:34:00]  All right, that's a horrible joke.  Boo-hoo-hoo.  Bill Burr came in.  He's a Red Sox guy.  Looks an ant.  And you kind of congratulated Anthony on the Yankees.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  Must be excited.  Well, because Ann had a lot to do with it, Bill.  Yeah, we did.  I love those guys.  We did it.  We did it today.  You see that last night?  We did it.  We're in.  Are we?  Are we?  We're the same losers with different jerseys sitting in the bleachers, eating the same 
[01:34:30]  crap, blocking our arteries.  Yelling at each other.  It is weird when you call up your friend and go, hey, congratulations, Eagles going to  the Super Bowl.  Freaking Joey Paisano.  Hey, congratulations, Eagles going to the Super Bowl there.  Oh, thanks.  And he's taking congratulatory calls all day long.  Yeah, hey, congrats.  What does he do with the fact that the Eagles went to the Super Bowl?  He's calling plays from his living room couch.  But yeah, I was listening to the game, and it's just, and then they win, and you realize,  all right, there's 13 years in a row that they're going to be in the playoffs. 
[01:35:00]  Dude, I honestly think, I'm not saying it's fixed, but it's just-  I love Philly, man.  It's manipulated, man.  How many sporting events can you watch, and you hear them go like, you couldn't write a  script better than this?  After what's like, that's right, you couldn't.  Dude, the number one rivalry that makes them money is the Yankees-Red Sox.  Of course.  The fact that they let us buy all the stars in the league pretty much ensures that we're  going to do it.  And literally, we're 15 games ahead. 
[01:35:30]  I'm bored out of my mind.  It's just like going to the track.  You're like, we're going to win.  We're going to win.  And you see the guy pulling back on the reins as the Yankees do.  They just keep winning.  I don't know what's going on.  And then it's like, remember when the Coyote used to chase the Roadrunner?  Somehow he could catch up with them.  He's running like a 4-1-40, and he would catch right up to him and then couldn't catch him,  but would stay just close enough so you'd watch the rest of the cartoon.  That's what they're doing.  They're going to keep us right to the last day eating hot dogs.  He's on to something. 
[01:36:00]  I think they're coming back.  Yankees had a horrendous start this year.  Yeah, awful.  And the Red Sox were, was it 15 games?  They were 15 games behind the Sox, and just, it was looking so grim.  And then.  Somebody stole home plate off of Andy Pettit.  And I'm sitting there, I'm buying every second.  Dude, they're done.  They're done.  That has never happened in the history of the Yankees.  Well, you know what the catalyst was, don't you?  Goodness gracious.  Yes.  The return of Roger Clemens.  Roger Clemens is here with his injuries. 
[01:36:30]  It's wonderful.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Here he is with George Steinbrenner in his box on his 85th birthday.  Can we get the whole clip?  We haven't played that in a while.  The excitement that she described is just like, you got to really pull over.  It just gets nutty.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  In nothing.  Nothing.  She tried to make this historic moment out of nothing.  You know the Yankees are sitting there like, can you believe this guy? 
[01:37:00]  He's coming.  Guy works part-time and makes $30 million?  Why did I show up in April?  You think it seems like they're all high-fiving?  Yeah.  They're just kind of peering over the dugout.  Oh, God.  Is he still highlighting his hair?  He looks fat in his suit.  That's all they're saying.  Do you think A-Rod's really like, oh, boy?  Oh, boy.  Thank God Roger's back.  You're right.  He's probably like, I'd tag him.  Still as fat as he is.  Dude, ever since I saw when all this stuff came out about the 1998 baseball season, which 
[01:37:30]  I was done with baseball.  And then when they started hitting the home runs, I sat there like a little kid.  Everything other than eating Cracker Jacks watching this.  Yeah.  And then like seven, eight years later, you find out they're on roids.  They juiced up the ball.  They moved the walls in.  And no one was saying anything.  And I just felt like such an idiot.  It's like I bought the whole thing, you know?  And that's what brought everyone back to baseball from the strike.  And, you know, that's why people came back. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, the home run battle.  Pretty smart marketing, if you think about it.  All of a sudden, the guys are hitting 700-foot home runs.  Yeah, what happened there?  That's what I'm saying.  And like any time now, they're cracking down on steroids.  And who do they get?  They get like backup catchers.  Right, right.  Some guy in AAA.  But they're Brad Pitts of the league.  Coming out with like no necks.  No, he's cool.  That one checked him out.  He's good.  He's good.  He passes physical.  This is how you know is whenever they just keep showing somebody's off-season workout program.  It's like that preemptive strike. 
[01:38:30]  Look at me.  I even lift weights in the off-season.  I am.  Sure you do.  I'm sure you do.  Phil, you know, I always want to doubt you and these conspiracies you come up with and these little things that are going on.  But this one, I think you might be on to something.  Dude, it's all.  We all bought into it.  He's so right.  No one's going to.  Anything past a million dollars is fixed.  That's why Phil Spector, he's never going to jail.  Yeah.  Guys are never going.  It's fixed at that point.  They come walking in.  He actually had the nerve to come in there with that mullet perm.  That huge mullet perm. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Like a murder trial.  That's how fixed that thing was.  And the L.A. prosecution gets so much heat for not being able to prosecute these guys.  But they're like, they're going against the superstars.  They're going against these guys that got millions of dollars to pump into lawyers.  Uh-huh.  And they lose all the time.  Hey, before you move too far forward here, we've got to play the Susan Waldman clip.  Susan Waldman!  It's one of our favorite things of all time.  Here it is.  Thank you all. 
[01:39:30]  Well, they came and got me out of Texas.  Uh-oh.  And I can tell you it's a privilege to be back.  I'll be talking to you all soon.  Roger Clemens is in Georgia's box.  And Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box announcing he is back. 
[01:40:00]  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  So, big size, Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention fans, he is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation. 
[01:40:30]  She is such a traitor, by the way, doing that with that heavy Boston accent.  Oh, my gosh.  Roger Clemens.  Just got out of the car.  Goodness gracious.  That's what was going on in the Yankees dugout.  The madness.  Posada had a smile.  A grin.  Petit knew.  No.  You know, you know, just...  Posada smiled.  She's making it sound like it's the end of the natural.  Gene is throwing a ball up and catching it in his glove. 
[01:41:00]  And Rivera's having a water.  It's World War III in the dugout.  And the entire kid just zipped up his own pants.  They're going crazy.  Joe Torre is online trying to get Frank a new prostate.  Oh, wow.  I can't top that one.  Joe Leppertone is doing coke.  She is the best.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, this is not one of the number 1565. 
[01:41:30]  Why did I got that good spot on Christmas Eve in Bloomingdale's?  Dude, she sounds like she's announcing wrestling.  Yeah.  Andre the Giant steps over the top rope into the square circle.  Hulk Hogan's been hit with a chair.  And the ref didn't see it.  Goodness gracious.  Do I love that, man. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, by the way, helping Bill's theory, Yankees were 14 and a half games out back on May 29th.  Yeah.  And then a miracle happened.  They got it all together.  They were able to put it together.  Something happened.  They started hitting.  Still having problems with the pitching.  But they were able to.  All of a sudden, we couldn't win.  And then they caught right up.  But couldn't quite catch up.  Oh, here they come.  Oh, they didn't quite do it.  Oh, right when the coyote lunges.  You're going to watch it right to October 1st. 
[01:42:30]  So they sell out that last game.  Yep.  I want to hear your conspiracy on the whole patch cheating thing.  Got anything on the patch cheating?  What's your take on that whole thing?  Oh, man.  The only thing I can do is I just had to roll with it.  Because being a Patriots fan, like I got trashed on so many radio stations.  Everybody trashing the Patriots.  I'm just like, hey.  I was in Buffalo.  I was like, well, you know, maybe you guys went to Best Buy before one of your four Super Bowls.  You would have a ring, too.  Dude, there's too much money involved.  Yes, they're all cheating. 
[01:43:00]  It's like.  That's what I.  Thank you.  That's what I say.  Were we cheating when we dropped the bomb on Japan?  No.  Because they didn't have one yet?  No.  It's war.  Right.  It's a great way to put it.  The massacre of 70,000 people.  Yeah.  With some defensive coordinator.  Trying to beat the Jets.  I'm telling you, man.  I had to go for big air.  There's nothing I could do.  Yeah.  I like the fact Billy went on the attack, though.  Like, he didn't back off.  No.  He went right on the attack with Buffalo.  Good for you.  No.  There was a day where I was just like, wow.  Then we're just going to have to take this.  Yeah.  We're going to have to take this one.  Like, wow.  And then they got stuff in their home. 
[01:43:30]  But then I talked to a couple of guys.  I talked to this guy who was in Georgia, of all places.  Went to a football game down there.  And he used to play quarterback.  He goes, dude, we used to steal signs all the time.  That's what I hope so.  Yeah.  He said, yeah.  I mean, it helps.  But it's like, it only helps, like, so much.  Like, these idiots going on, like, they should give their rings back.  I mean, come on.  Well, what idiots are those?  I think the league is pissed off at Mangini for blowing up everyone's spot.  I think every team was doing this.  And all of a sudden, the rest of the league is going, what is he doing? 
[01:44:00]  We all know we do this.  We know you do this.  So shut up.  No.  But plus, he was with the Patriots.  He built up his resume doing that.  Right.  Right.  It's almost like you robbed a bank with another guy.  One guy's driving the car.  He just robbed the bank.  It's like, dude, you were driving the car.  I'm right.  No, it was, yeah, he broke some sort of, I mean, obviously, I'm not a coach,  but I think he broke some sort of guy code in coaching.  Yeah, I think so, too.  You don't, what you're supposed to do is do what Chuck Knoll does. 
[01:44:30]  He used to do at the end of the game, if someone was doing something cheesy,  you just came up and you put, like, you know, he had, like, a, I don't know,  titanium finger, and he would just poke it right through your chest.  Ow.  Yeah, he did that to that guy, Jerry Glanville.  That would hurt.  Yeah, he had everybody, like, was doing crackback blocking and blowing out his knees.  He didn't complain to the league.  He just came and just put his index finger right through the guy's chest,  his little satin oiler's jacket.  Yeah.  I'll have jack ham rape your family. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  All right, we'll back off.  Yeah, right.  But I don't know.  I mean, the last two weeks we've, you know, beat the crap out of both teams we played.  Yeah.  I love, like, that guy in San Diego, you know, if the Patriots motto, if you ain't cheating,  you ain't trying.  Really?  Why don't you find another star player on steroids on your team?  You're going to sit there, oh.  Wow, he is really on the attack.  That's how I do it.  I haven't taken any guff.  Dude, you know what it really is, is I got an hour and a half sleep right now,  and I'm going to crash in about six minutes. 
[01:45:30]  So I'm just trying to get as many laughs as I can.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You're just sprinting right now.  Yeah, and I'm just, yeah, it's going to be it.  You're going to be on the sideline, huffing and puffing.  Why were you up so late?  Just on West Coast time, though.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah, you're an L.A. guy, man.  I didn't know Bill moved.  I'm like, Bill, why are you moving?  Dude, I had a little party with paper hats to celebrate my leaving.  I thought for sure that would somehow at least...  I didn't get any invite or anything.  I'd love to...  No.  You had nothing. 
[01:46:00]  Move to L.A. if you're in, like, your 20s.  I guess you have a party.  Like, when you're in your 30s, then people are like,  are you going to limp out there again?  What, are you going to play the dad on a sitcom?  Good luck, loser.  I didn't need that party.  That's got to be rough for, like, when you say that,  play the dad on someone's dad.  Like, when you were playing, like, a kid or some sexy chick,  it's always some, like, younger girl that all of a sudden has grown up  and she's playing the mom. 
[01:46:30]  You know when she's first offered that part.  I don't care how many interviews.  This is just a wonderful, you know, advancement in my career.  And she's such an important character that I'm playing.  It's got to be like, oh, my God, I'm playing a mom now.  That's it.  The little daughter roles, the chick roles are gone.  It's a new challenge.  Yeah, it's a new challenge for me.  And the news person will always say something like that.  Now, we've known you, we've watched you grow up,  and we're used to seeing you playing the daughters.  Now, how is this playing a mother? 
[01:47:00]  It's great.  It's just great.  Everybody gets into this business and rehearses the accepting an Oscar speech,  and then you end up playing, like, the dad on that 70s show.  And you're just like, oh, man.  Screw it.  I had big dreams.  It's a check.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We've got Bill Burr in the studio.  We've got Vinny in the sound booth over there, the owner of the stress factory.  Oh, there he is.  Yes.  And Bill's going to...  By the way, I don't like, excuse me, I don't like the wave Vinny just gave us.  Like, he was in the press box. 
[01:47:30]  Like, he looks at the opposing team's announcer,  and we just camera it up to him and he gave the little wave.  Like, take care of business, boy.  Congratulations to your induction into the Comedy Club Hall of Fame.  Oh, my God.  Of all the dramatic things.  Unbelievable.  He just wave-tossed from the box.  7-3-2-5-4-5.  Ha-ha.  It even sounds like a laugh, ladies and gentlemen.  Ladies and gentlemen, goodness gracious, Vinny Brand's in the box, waving.  You should see the look on Jim Norton's face.  Oh, my God.  No. 
[01:48:00]  If you need someone to sound like a midget...  Oh, yeah.  It's too bad more people don't watch Little People Big World,  because he sounds exactly like Matt Roloff, the star of that show.  The midget.  Yep.  The midget father.  Vinny Brand does?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Vinny, come in here for a second.  It's too a T.  This will make some people out there laugh.  There's probably a small percentage of people that know what we're talking about,  but Vinny Brand sounds exactly like Matt Roloff.  Yeah.  What's up, Vinny?  I sound exactly like him.  Huh?  I do.  I sound exactly like him.  That's it.  That's my voice. 
[01:48:30]  I'm a midget.  He's got a better career than me.  That's really belittling.  And Matt Roloff, they arrested him for DUI recently.  They did?  Oh, yeah.  He had like a beer and a half or something, and now he's in trouble.  That's great.  He blew a 1.9 in the alcohol.  That's when you know you're a real star, though.  You get the DUI, and everyone knows about it.  He did a Jell-O shot, and now he blew a 1.9.  One Jell-O shot.  He is on TV.  Vinny's doing comedy for 20 years.  All that guy had to do was have a mother who drank through pregnancy. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  How does that make you feel, Vinny?  That's great.  I'm really miserable having his voice.  Dude, there's no way that guy's going to get convicted.  I didn't know the first couple times you busted my balls.  I had no idea who you were talking about.  Do we have the Matt Roloff clip?  Oh, poor Iraq.  Thanks, Iraq.  Thanks a lot, Iraq.  You could have really helped us out here.  Thanks of all the dramatic things I've seen in my life.  Oh, my God.  He's shaped like a box.  See, the beauty of radio, there's probably 90% of the people listening right now are like,  I don't know, little people, big world.  Yeah.  But see, if Iraq had the clip, then we play the clip, and then we have Vinny talk, and then 
[01:49:30]  everyone's like, holy crap, he sounds exactly like him.  You can't teach anticipation.  Oh, no.  He's gone to the, he's run to the folder.  Iraq's now pulled out a folder full of 10,000 CDs, and he's going to thumb through them one  by one.  That's right.  Why don't you just listen to all of them in real time?  We'll wait.  Why don't you have a ball over there, son?  There's no timing involved with a bit like this at all.  No, no.  Whenever you can get to it, Iraq, just.  He's lost his edge the last few days, Iraq, I've got to say. 
[01:50:00]  That's right.  He's becoming round.  He's so far.  By the way, Clemens in that booth was horrendous when they, she said that, and Roger Spears.  Oh, I know.  Hey, I'll be talking to y'all real soon.  You got me out of Texas.  Oh, just.  Dude, I basically wanted to say, holy ass, I've got to get on a treadmill now.  That's why the people, I think the Yankees were laughing, is because you know before that  he goes, they're actually going to bring me out in front of the crowd.  Yeah.  Like Hannibal Lecter. 
[01:50:30]  Like, I don't want to do this.  So they were probably laughing how uncomfortable he was.  Yeah.  Hey.  Did you breastfeed Catherine Susan?  What?  What?  Oh, goodness gracious.  Iraq, any luck?  Or should we just go to break?  The midget sounds just like this.  This is what the midget sounds like.  You have to know.  There's the tape.  It sounds like that.  Yeah, there it is.  Just listen to this, and then go at your own YouTube and find it, and it sounds like me.  This extra leisure.  Vinny, are you going to be going on in front of me? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, I'm going to do a phone call right in front of you.  I love it.  No, you're not doing the phone call.  No, I'm not.  Thank you.  I won't do a phone call.  Once you get to a certain level, like Norton killed the phone call, you killed the phone  call.  If you're just some schmo, I do a phone call.  Well, you've got to, it actually never bothered me, because it was kind of like, I-  You've got to explain, though.  Vinny does, he's a great comedian in his own right, and then at the end of his set, he likes  to do a little prank phone call using someone in the audience, you know, you call their  parents or something, and tell them some horrific thing.  Yeah, horrible, horrible stuff. 
[01:51:30]  But, like, Burr's going to do an hour, so I'm not going to do it, because it takes you  to take up a whole hour.  Norton does an hour.  So if a guy's only got 45, I do a phone call.  It doesn't hurt anybody, Bill.  He really does.  Dude, you encourage people to start screaming at the stage.  Yeah, but you know what?  That's all the thing.  It's like everybody's sitting there ready to watch, and the next day, he's yelling at  the stage.  All right, you guys ready for your headliner?  Wait.  It's funny shit has happened.  I mean, we've had-  What?  Vinny, what?  Just-  What?  Funny stuff has happened.  I think that people get arrested. 
[01:52:00]  We've had fun stuff.  Vinny, just admit, you don't want to pay for an opener.  So you're going down there, and you're tap dancing with a payphone in your hand.  Yeah, well, I save a lot of money that way.  It's all about saving-  I'm giving a rough time.  It's actually been funny.  All right.  It's been funny.  We've got to take a quick break.  We're going to find the Matt Roloff clip, so everyone knows what we're talking about  today.  Vinny Brand in studio, Bill Burr, playing Stress Factory this weekend.  The number is something with ha-ha in it.  That's only me or not.  732-545-HA-HA.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:52:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Vinny, you can go back into the class booth.  We can't find the Matt Roloff clip.  Oh, thanks.  I want to say, by the way, that's the only thing I have to offer the show.  Yeah, so far.  Yeah.  And the last time you were here, you told people to come. 
[01:53:00]  I forget what you told me.  Wait, the last time I was here?  When I was here.  I'm here every day.  I know.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  The last time I was here, you told people to come up and say something to me on stage.  Yeah.  I forget what it was, but all they came up to me and said was, talk like the midget.  That's what we told them to say, Vinny.  I don't talk like a midget.  It's just how I talk.  But not do a joke.  Oh, we hear your funny.  No, talk like the midget.  That's my...  That's your claim to fame with the radio show.  That's my only claim.  And we can't even do it today because we can't find the clip.  So hopefully we'll find it before we get out of here.  Uh, Bill Burr was just talking about air travel, everybody. 
[01:53:30]  I know, right?  What's up with that?  Is this crazy?  I'll tell you, if this thing crashes, this whole place is going to be an exit row.  Huh?  You guys ready for your next act?  I'm bringing the funny to the stress factory.  And that's why I do a phone call because I don't want to hear that.  Hey, Bill Burr.  Before you go on stage.  Bill Burr kills for you, Vinny.  Bill Burr destroy you.  That's why I don't make someone do jokes like that right in front of Bill.  That's why I do a phone call. 
[01:54:00]  It's better to have some kid getting arrested for prostitution.  Well, that's kind of funny, though, because the plane would break open.  And I get it.  It's funny.  You brought up a good point, though, during the break, that when you're flying from L.A. to New York  and you see the other planes passing you, in the old days, you're 100% right.  You would see a plane passing you going toward L.A. as you're going toward New York.  And they looked like they were in the distance.  And that kind of scared you.  Yeah.  That seemed a little close.  That's when they had all the UFO sightings. 
[01:54:30]  You thought it was something extraterrestrial.  It had to be a flying saucer.  Yeah.  But that's how far away it was.  Yeah, because like we were talking, you're going 500 miles an hour.  They're going 500 miles an hour at you.  So it's like you're seeing something going 1,000 miles an hour.  So that thing flies by.  You've got to think UFO.  Absolutely.  But you brought up a good point.  Now the planes are passing each other a little too closely.  Dude, it's like they're on the other side of the street.  I was down there.  One went by us.  Two lane roads.  If we weren't going so fast, I could have waved to somebody.  It was terrifying. 
[01:55:00]  And I swear to God.  And then, you know, when you get like the turbulence, look at some cleaner air.  Cleaner air.  Yeah.  And then they drop down.  So because I know, I don't know how it works.  Odds and evens.  Like when you fly across the country.  Like if you're going west, everybody's on even and odds or whatever.  But at some point when I'm dropping down, I'm in the odds.  And we're playing chicken with another plane.  That's all I'm saying.  Well, you've got to pass through the odd to get back to an even as you're going down.  And you've got to hope that the air traffic control knows this and sees that there isn't anybody else there. 
[01:55:30]  It's inevitable.  There's going to be a head-on collision.  There's something going on.  There's so many planes in the air now because they went from back a few years back.  They were big planes.  You'd get like 747.  I remember taking 747s to L.A.  Stuff like that.  You barely ever get a 747 now.  It's all international stuff.  They use those.  Now it's more smaller planes and they just use more of them.  So there's more of those in the sky. 
[01:56:00]  Instead of one 747, you have like three 737s in the sky.  Because of 9-11, they had to add an extra two rows and jam people together more.  And then they can only offer you peanuts because they're supporting the troops.  And somehow they've got to keep taking away benefits because they're all losing money.  Yet every flight you get on, it's always like, okay, this is a very full flight.  Very full.  It's like every one of them is jam-packed.  And every time I fly into Newark, they're always going.  They were always delayed. 
[01:56:30]  And they always say, hey, there's a weather problem.  There's a problem with the weather.  And you land and it's like 78 degrees out.  Some guy sitting in a lawn chair with the orange things like bringing you in.  It's like.  Yeah, not a cloud in the sky.  Yeah, dude, I'm telling you.  Why?  Also, you're right.  I don't remember the last time I was on a plane where you looked around and went, wow, this is an empty flight.  There really aren't many people on this thing.  They always, all right, make sure you take your carry-on and put it in this store and above.  We have a very full flight today. 
[01:57:00]  You can sit on your luggage or an infant.  That would help expedite.  Expedite, right.  Yeah, that's their favorite word.  Love the word expedite.  Then they got the thing.  If they move the jetway, the second they pull that away from the plane, that's considered an on-time departure.  We left on time.  Yeah, the second.  We pulled that little walkie thing away, right?  And then they just pull you off.  They know they're going to stick you in that thing for at least two hours.  Like, enjoy your flight.  These people have no idea.  And then they take you out. 
[01:57:30]  They back you up, dude.  And then they pull you over.  And then they just sit.  And then they become the Gestapo.  Sit down, sir.  Sit down.  Sir, there's no standing.  We're on an active taxiway.  Sit down, sir.  This is a very full flight.  Like, what?  We're having weather problems.  We're going to do a Z pattern into Newark.  And then they go into the holding pattern.  You're looking down.  Is that the Eiffel Tower?  Yeah.  What is going on here?  What the hell is the...  An active runway is the best...  Like, you standing up.  What does that have to do with being on an active runway? 
[01:58:00]  There was a place that they brought the plane one day.  We were ready to leave.  We were on time.  On time departure.  We're rolling out.  And then we turn.  And we're not headed toward the runway anymore.  And he goes, we're going to a place called...  I think they called it the ball...  The bullpen.  The bullpen.  I was going to say the ballpark.  But we're going to have to sit in the bullpen for a while.  And it's just planes lined up in a parking lot for planes.  It's a parking lot for planes. 
[01:58:30]  And you're just like, what is this?  We're going to have to sit in the bullpen for a while until some weather clears.  And, of course, it was beautiful where we were.  But I guess somewhere where we were going, there was weather somewhere in the way.  I was in Denver.  This is what they did, okay?  We get on the plane.  And evidently, they oversold the flight.  I don't know how you do that.  You know how many seats you got.  How many people have?  Hey, you know, 260, 270, whatever.  Whatever.  They're going to start installing straps.  Like the subway. 
[01:59:00]  The old subways.  They're offering, like, coupons to TGI Fridays if you take, like, the next flight.  Right?  So, they end up saying because of the altitude we're at in Denver, they can't put enough gas in there.  I don't know if it expands.  I never took a science class.  So, now we have to go to St. Louis to get more gas so we can go to Newark.  And it was the same thing, dude.  So, they pull us off to the bullpen.  We're sitting there because they didn't know we were going to go to St. Louis.  Then we land in St. Louis.  They know we're coming, but the gas truck, it takes an hour for that guy to get over there. 
[01:59:30]  He fills us up, and then we pull over again.  And then we cut flying in.  Then there was weather problems.  It was like literally a 15-hour flight.  Nothing ever happens fast.  It's never there's an issue or, like, you need the fuel truck, and they make a call and go, hey, drive it over here.  And you could see out the window.  You go, here comes the fuel truck.  They must have just called him.  I just picture them going, yeah, we're going to need some fuel.  And then they just sit for a while and wait.  No one's called anyone. 
[02:00:00]  Just nothing is happening.  I think they make all that up anyway.  Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, as a midget, is every seat like a first-class teacher?  Is everything an exit row for you?  I have plenty of leg room.  I have a lot of room.  We found the Matt Roloff clip, so.  Oh, goody.  Do we have it, Iraq?  This is who Vinny sounds like.  Matt Roloff from Little People, Big World, the father.  For example, a story or talk about what does that value mean to them?  And give us an example of something in your life that highlights the value. 
[02:00:30]  Dude, that's the midget.  Oh, my God.  It was a very interesting exercise.  I would recommend every family to sit down and to do that.  Help pull you together.  It was great.  It was a very enlightening and very productive session.  So, this book was more than, you know, just another project.  It was actually kind of a team building or family building exercise.  And then right after that, I drink and drive.  There you go.  Is that amazing?  Now, Vinny, give the plug for Bill Burr at the Stress Factory.  Bill Burr will be at the Stress Factory this weekend.  It's a very family building thing at the Stress Factory. 
[02:01:00]  Five, four, five.  Ha, ha.  It's a very family building moment with Bill.  How much does that suck?  That's your claim to fame on this radio show.  That's all there is.  We've been waiting years to get on this show.  We finally found an angle that he probably doesn't like.  I have to hope that Matt does something really bizarre and bad.  He did.  DUI, man.  Yeah, but that's not really bad enough.  He has to do something vicious to get him on.  And by the way, back to planes, I think they make all those excuses up.  Like, we need fuel.  We can't put fuel on.  How can you build an airport where you can't put fuel on a plane?  That's ridiculous. 
[02:01:30]  I think when they have a delay or any kind of thing like that they have to do,  they just sit in an office and go, tell them this.  Let's see what they look like.  They make it up.  Yeah.  Yeah, and try to see how ridiculous they can get.  It's like, let's try the one about we can't put the fuel in because we're up so high.  Dude, I was in Denver and they told me the pilot isn't here yet.  He's coming in on another plane.  We waited five and a half hours.  Where is he flying from?  He's going to get on my plane now and fly away.  Oh, and that's the thing, too.  The way they present it, it's all going to be good in 20 minutes. 
[02:02:00]  And they just give you these 20-minute increments.  He should be here by, you know, just past the top of the hour.  They sound like bad DJs.  Stay by the terminal area where there is nothing to do and no comfy seats.  Don't go to the bar.  Don't go to a lounge.  You know what I like when someone snaps?  Yeah.  I like when I watch a passenger just snap on the person.  They just like go nuts.  And then you look at them and go, sir, you're going to be on the do not fly list.  And they got you so much by the balls.  There's nothing you can do.  It's so entertaining for everyone else when someone does snap at that desk by the gate 
[02:02:30]  because they start yelling.  And then you give the other people the look like, hey, dude, look at this guy.  He's the guy that lost it.  You're like mentally trying to hit her.  Hit her.  Come on.  Make it entertaining.  I'm bored out of my mind.  This plane is going to be less full.  Hey, we got to play more Matt Roloff because Vinny had a big segment here.  My name is Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  We're little people.  When you're only four foot tall, you're feeling like you're living in a world that wasn't made for you. 
[02:03:00]  So we're making our own life on our 34-acre farm here in Oregon.  As a child, I spent literally years in a hospital bed dreaming about having the ultimate childhood.  Now I get to make those dreams come true for my kids.  All right.  Talk about planes more, Vinny.  Go ahead.  I dreamt about being four foot five my whole life.  I dreamt in a hospital bed.  Stuck you in carry-on.  Stuck you in the overhead.  I'm sorry.  We're going to have to check this midget. 
[02:03:30]  The carry-on's full.  It is exact.  The accent is slightly off, but besides that, he's got it.  Hey, Jim from Danbury.  Get this.  I went to the Bahamas.  We were sitting on the runway, and the pilot over the speaker says there's a problem with the plane, and they have to fix it.  Then 15 minutes later, he said that the part wasn't needed.  I hate when they do that crap.  There you go.  Because the whole time you're in the air, you're like...  Yeah, but that's what I mean.  They just make it up.  We can make it.  It's all along.  Yeah.  I don't like when they say we've had a mechanical problem or some kind of mechanical issue.  They never say problem.  They make it sound as harmless as possible. 
[02:04:00]  And they don't tell you what it is.  I would like to know if it's something with the...  Is it the clock?  Right.  Is it the clock up front, or is it the turbine?  They always say landing light.  We got a landing light.  The wing's hanging off.  Landing light.  I got a flat tire.  I got.  The plane got a flat tire.  A front flat tire once at the gate.  And they pulled us back a little bit, and we're all sitting there while they fixed it.  And no crap.  I felt the jack actually going, on the plane. 
[02:04:30]  I'm like, this shouldn't be.  You don't watch that.  They shouldn't change a tire on a plane like you do on an old Buick.  You'd be happy they didn't use a can of fix-a-flat.  You'd just see the fix-a-flat roll out onto the runway.  This guy's kicking it real discreetly under a dumpster.  Three more flights out of this tire.  Don't worry about it.  I was on a U.S. air flight one time.  Fix-a-flat.  I was on a U.S. air flight.  I mean, the emergency room, I look on the wing, and there's silver tape.  Like, the duct tape thing.  Oh, I've seen that.  And it's peeling up.  And I call the flight attendant, and I'm like, there's tape on the wing of this plane. 
[02:05:00]  And she's like, well, I'm like, get the pilot.  It's supposed to.  There's tape.  He's like William Shatner.  There's a man on the wing.  A man on the wing.  Duct tape, sir.  They actually had to.  I saw the man on the wing.  They delayed the flight, and the guy had to come and re-put the silver.  It's like this metal tape that he is.  Yeah, it's just like duct tape, only it's got an aluminum top instead of a.  Like, rubberized one.  It's still, they duct tape the wing.  Yeah, yeah.  They put some on the wing.  That's wonderful.  Dude, but they seriously, they have stock lines just like comedians. 
[02:05:30]  Like, hey, I don't kick the broom out of your hand.  I talked to this.  Hey, we got a landing light out.  I talked to this pilot one time when I was in St. Louis, and I was talking about.  Enough about St. Louis.  I just had a.  A little longer.  I just had an aborted landing.  We were flying.  That's a messy one.  Big hangar through the plane.  Big song.  Big sand woman tucked off in an alleyway.  Get rid of this.  Oh, no. 
[02:06:00]  We're landing in a dumpster.  So, we end up.  Hold on.  There's a happy single guy.  Is your flight as a board?  Hey.  So, anyways, long story short, before you guys get back to the fetus jokes.  The guy, we ended up, as we looped around, you know, the guy ended up saying that there  was a vehicle or something like that on the runway.  And I remember when I was telling the pilots the story, they go, what did they say?  And I said, oh, they said that there was a vehicle on the runway. 
[02:06:30]  And all three of them started laughing.  I think I've used that one.  Oh.  Yeah.  And so, I go, well, what does that mean?  He goes, it could have meant anything.  It could have meant that it was actually a vehicle on a runway.  There was another plane coming at you.  That's a vehicle?  Yeah.  A plane is a vehicle.  They tell you what is going to keep you quiet.  If you're sitting on the runway and they tell you, hey, listen, we're not taking off  because we have too many flights and we screwed up, you would be furious.  They tell you, ah, we're missing a part.  People said, well, I better shut up a part.  I'm not going to complain.  Yeah.  I was on a flight.  Better here than in the air. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, right.  I was on a flight one time.  It was cross country.  And I'm like, we were delayed taking off.  And at first they said it was weather.  And they're like, we're going to be delayed because the Jews control the media.  How that fixes it.  That shuts everybody right up.  Everyone just went, yes.  Okay, they do.  Of course.  I understand that.  Well, we'll sit here a while.  Yes.  They use that one in the Midwest and in the South.  Everybody's like, oh, that's understandable.  All right, this side of the show is going to end.  Hey, Vinny, I got your bit. 
[02:07:30]  Go ahead.  Dirty Matt Roloff when the show comes back on the air.  All right, how did it?  Little People, Big World, we'll have you come in and we'll have you record some Dirty Matt  Roloff lines and then we'll splice it into the actual show.  All right, guys.  It'll be terrific for everyone.  There you go.  There's your bit.  We got Carrot Top at 930 on XM.  Just saw him on the CW11 here in New York.  Yeah, he's scary.  A big boy.  He's doing something.  He laid down and then pulled a traffic cone out of his shirt.  And then he did four push-ups.  The big boy.  He's jacked.  Yeah, he's testing positive, I'm sure. 
[02:08:00]  That boy can hit a home run or two.  I know.  You mean a couple of things.  Put him in the lineup.  Do you really need steroids in comedy?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  He looks a little freaky, doesn't he?  He's jacked.  The entire comedy world made fun of his act for 10 years, 15.  He couldn't take it anymore.  He took an ass.  I was on a flight one time and I'm like, why was this flight aborted?  And I looked at it and it had a big tongue and a Pete Rose wig.  I'm like, it should have been.  All right.  Bill Burr at the Stress Factory all weekend long. 
[02:08:30]  Vinnie Brand's club there.  And what's the phone number again, Jimmy, for Bill Burr tickets?  It really is the greatest club, man.  702.  I heard a gentleman stepped up to the plane's hangar and kicked it with a Doc Martin.  You know what it is?  The father of the one plane found out that it was an African airline plane and demanded  that the American airline flight be aborted.  You ain't parking that in my hangar. 
[02:09:00]  732-545-4242.  That was the Stray Club in Philly, of course, a great comment.  Oh, yeah.  We'll sell out.  Bill's going to kill him.  All right.  We're out.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  The O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:09:30]  The O.B. andotti.  We'll be right back. 
[02:10:00]  Satellite radio, some kind of problem in New York, I don't know.  Construction records again.  I think it was a power outage due to some type of construction problem.  At the new studio, and we're going to be in the new studio starting Monday.  We start that old gag Monday where we go from one studio to the other. 
[02:10:30]  But it's a state-of-the-art brand new studio.  We're really excited to see it.  We're going to check it out today.  Hey, we've got to leave a little early today to check out some new equipment.  I can't wait to see the problems we have with brand new equipment.  Oh, it's going to be great.  Yeah, but it'll be all right.  I mean, I saw the place about a month ago.  You guys are going to be amazed.  I mean, it's in a glass box.  They're working on bleachers for the listeners.  It's ridiculous.  It's going to be like 10 or 12 flat screens all over the place with different stations tuned in. 
[02:11:00]  State-of-the-art Paltalk cameras that are way better than the ones we're using now.  I purposefully stayed out of it.  I can't wait.  But this morning, the show had to be in the bullpen for a while.  Yeah.  You're waiting for a part.  Yeah, we're in the bullpen.  We couldn't get it out.  Yeah, we should have just told the listeners that there was a problem with some of the equipment.  Yeah.  And not really gotten specific.  We're waiting for a part.  Yeah, I don't know what the hell was going on.  It's weather.  But we're here.  Weather-related.  Problem with the show.  Especially when it was blow. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  You should be happy listening to nothing while we're getting that worked out.  Sit tight.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Sit tight.  Ladies and gentlemen, the show was on time, but our gate isn't available yet.  We're going to have to sit here for a while, but we'll keep you updated.  Let you know when we're going to be able to get the show.  Yeah, the second I get any information, we'll pass it along to you here on the flight deck.  Go fuck yourself. 
[02:12:00]  I'm as pissed off as you are.  Dude, they probably fly in remote control.  Yeah.  You have some guy.  Oh, would that be amazing?  Some guy up in the tower just making up shit.  That's the whole reason the door has to be closed and locked now.  It had nothing to do with 9-11.  It's they figured out how to just remote pilot every plane, and they have a recording up  there that the pilot just talks to you.  They just have an out-of-work actor come walking out on the end of it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  I landed the plane.  That's like 18.  He's just trying to get somewhere, too. 
[02:12:30]  That's his seat.  Hey, I got to interrupt.  Instant feedback.  Nick H., did you just hear what the fuck we said?  Holy shit, you start half an hour late and leave half an hour early.  You guys are liars and suck cock.  Nick H.  There was a fucking power outage in New York.  We sat around here and fucking jerked off for a half hour.  I'd love to hear a pilot talk like that.  That would be great.  We're sitting on the runway because we can't fucking leave.  That's why.  Because the fucking plane's not ready.  We're out of fucking gas.  Sit down.  It's a full flight, asshole.  Shut up.  These guys got to chill the fuck out. 
[02:13:00]  We just explained exactly what happened.  And then the instant feedback is still coming in.  What the fuck, guys?  Why are you calling it in today?  What an idiot.  If you had a pal talk, Cameron, you would have seen that we were just sitting around waiting,  jerking off, talking about nonsense, waiting for the power outage to be fixed in New York.  And then the first thing we said when we got on was there was a power outage at XM.  That's why we weren't on.  And then the guy writes, dude.  Dude, it's the don't listen type fucking angry guy.  Oh, blow. 
[02:13:30]  Your fucking mother.  Your fucking mother.  Now we leave at 1030.  That was old school.  That's it.  Your mother.  Your fucking mother.  You never even had to say what your mother did or what she did.  Just your fucking mother.  Your mother.  Hey, your mother.  All right.  Listen, bullshit was said on Fox News.  We've been waiting to play this on XM.  This is a great pause.  This is a great clip.  Happened about an hour ago.  You were covered in bees and you didn't want to run inside because you didn't want them 
[02:14:00]  to swarm all over your wife.  Yeah.  He came to the front door and he pounded on it and I opened the door and he was standing  there and he said, don't open the door.  You'll get bees in there.  And I said, bullshit.  Bullshit.  Excuse me.  I'm drugging back in.  Oh, man.  Hey, they all started laughing.  And he said, don't open the door.  You'll get bees in there. 
[02:14:30]  And I said, bullshit.  Excuse me.  I'm drugging back in.  Right.  Well, buddy.  We've got all kinds of language on here.  Right.  Don't we?  Oh, my.  They don't have a delay on that channel?  Yeah.  What the hell?  Are they crazy?  I don't know.  You know, if you see some little old lady, if you've got that button, you're like, ah,  I can finish my breakfast bagel.  There's going to be no problem with this old bat.  Ah, he started rubbing my cunt.  It is ridiculous that. 
[02:15:00]  A bee flew up my asshole.  That's right.  It sat on my clit.  I think it was the queen because they all joined it.  It is ridiculous that they don't allow bullshit and fuck on TV.  Every single person that's watching TV uses the damn word.  Look at how shocked they are.  Everyone's like, oh, my.  Oh.  Ah.  I think they're shocked because it came out of an old broad.  Yeah.  I would love to hear the control booth.  Who the fuck let bullshit go out?  Yeah.  How the fuck did that happen?  What asshole?  You fucking do your fire, you piece of shit scumbag. 
[02:15:30]  Cocksucker.  Someone said shit.  Can't let that shit over the air, you fucking douchebag.  The fuck is this?  You were covered in bees, and you didn't want to run inside because you didn't want them  to swarm all over your wife.  Yeah.  He came to the front door, and he pounded on it, and I opened the door, and he was standing  there, and he said, don't open the door, you'll get bees in there.  And I said, bullshit, excuse me, and drug him back in. 
[02:16:00]  You know what's funny?  You're going to all find the language I had to say.  Right.  Only that kind of story goes with that accent.  Yeah.  And they came up, and there was a badger stuck to his head, and I was like, don't open the  door, he's going to rip your fucking foot off, excuse me.  That's only with that accent.  You never hear that.  That shit just doesn't happen.  Certain accents you don't hear certain things with, like you're never going to hear. 
[02:16:30]  So I saw her, and I said, you know what?  Color doesn't matter.  They're in love.  And then we have another one, even with the same theme.  A newscaster has no script, panics, and starts cursing.  No.  Good.  I love these guys.  Yeah, this one's pretty good.  When that teleprompter goes out, they just wink out.  You should call this moments of honesty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're finally just being their real selves. 
[02:17:00]  They have to be their real selves.  That must horrify a newscaster when that teleprompter goes black or just stops.  Oh, yeah.  And then in the city today, they start drooling.  I like to make werewolf movies.  You got the old one, E-Roc?  You know what that's like?  There's a few that we really like.  Go ahead, Bill.  My mother can play the piano, but only if she has piano music in front of her.  She's like totally tone deaf, but her parents made her go. 
[02:17:30]  So she can play any song you want within reason.  Reasonable difficulty.  But the second you take the music away, she's like...  I don't see Bill's mother playing Swanee River.  You know what's funny?  She probably doesn't have music to that.  Wow, that's good music.  Oh, here it is.  Ah, the news.  Good evening and thank you for joining us.  I'm Chris Van Horn.  The accident happened before 11 o'clock last night on Highway 99 at Avenue 24, about three 
[02:18:00]  miles north of the Kern County line.  The big rig careened through the center median into the northbound lane.  And struck two vehicles head-on.  The first vehicle that struck head-on contained two adult passengers at...  Ah, we need to...  We need to start over then.  I'm sorry, I didn't write that script and I...  Shit, that's not the right one. 
[02:18:30]  It never happened.  It never happened.  It never happened.  Why do you need script to figure out what happened?  Big rig hit a passenger with two people and they are fine, apparently.  They just hobbled away with a scratch.  Until when the script got fucked up, though, a big rig hit a family of eight and they danced  because it was snowing. 
[02:19:00]  I'll be the copy, Error.  Ah, shit.  We're going to have to fucking do...  Oh, fuck.  Shit.  We should stay with this subject.  We've got a couple more examples.  Which one do you want to do?  Just play either one there, E-Rock.  Now in world news, police in Portugal now have a description of a...  Let me find that script here.  A nit. 
[02:19:30]  I apologize.  Here we are.  Police in Portugal now have a description of a man they believe may be involved in the  case of a missing four-year-old British...  Is that guy scrambling?  Oh, wow.  And we got one more?  All right, here's one more.  A local man spots something suspicious and that he decides to spring into action. 
[02:20:00]  He has done something that is very good.  Fort New Jersey police need to know if you have seen anything of the man who exposed himself  to several women and children.  They released this composite sketch.  He turns into Brian Rican.  And it's good-in, is it?  Something good?  It's good-in.  I don't think they're even listening to what they're saying.  They're just reading.  That's what we've always said.  It's just reading.  Yeah.  And the second it winks out, they are gone and lost. 
[02:20:30]  He sprung.  And that was very good.  And that was good.  And boom goes dynamite.  Right.  And the one clip you can hear in the background, the guy say, oh, you're alive.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Just in case you thought they were keeping that.  Yeah.  And then we got the sports anchor farting, of course.  Might as well play all of them today.  Fuck.  Excuse me.  He'll be back.  Last night, round two, I was around two o'clock in the morning, you see, Jay.  Jesus.  I was flipping channel on ESPN2. 
[02:21:00]  He had vintage McDonald's.  All-American high school dunk contest.  He got blessed.  That's great.  That was a loud one.  Yeah.  That'd be really funny if it was Sue Simmons.  She just leans over a little.  Do that cheek up.  It was Diane Sawyer, and she actually turned to open her asshole and let it fire out.  Lit it.  Thank God I didn't shit myself.  See a lighter fart.  People are asking, why is Matt Roloff on your show cursing? 
[02:21:30]  A potty mouth midget.  Dirty.  Dirty midget.  Call them little people.  The primary purpose of the book was to really sit down and try to sort of put into our own words  kind of what makes our family tick and, you know, what we're about, what we believe in.  And the way we sort of organized those thoughts was to go, we actually went on the Internet  and we Googled up values, you know, our family values, and we gave us a list of, you know,  hundreds of different words that describe a value. 
[02:22:00]  And we pat that list around the dinner table, and everybody put a little star by the value  that was important in it.  None of that happened.  Shut up.  No one does that.  The one that we had more than three or four five stars.  That sounds like you as a teenager.  I were the one who said these must be our family values.  Little Vinny.  Yeah.  Little Vinny.  Little Vinny.  We all looked at the word miscarriage and thought, lucky devil.  It is so creepy how exact that was in there. 
[02:22:30]  Sorry, Vinny, but.  I love it.  There you go.  We got another one?  Damn.  All right.  Let's play this one.  Which one?  What?  We have a couple there.  Which one?  Oh.  Just either one, man.  All one.  Tomorrow will be their first game of the new year.  And Casey Walkup tells us their resolution is to toughen up.  Cobra, the Thunder enters 2007 with an 11-14-2 record.  That's 20 games out of place.  Hey, fuck off, guys.  So their new year's resolution is to simply win more games. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, man.  There's someone who thought his mic was off.  Oh, that's great.  Hot mic.  Hot mic.  Wow.  He was pissed at buzz.  Whoever that was.  Who was it?  The director?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the director.  Probably talking in his ear or something.  Yeah.  In his earpiece.  Oh.  Hey, fuck off.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you got to think that would be picked up by another mic in the studio unless  there probably wasn't any studio mics on.  By a different room.  They were like, went, yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, probably went to a tape piece or something?  That was wild.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Oh, that guy is mad.  And finally, one more.  Oh, this is Bob Novak and James Carville?  James Carville.  Yeah.  We just talked to the senator from Oklahoma, Senator Tom Coburn.  Everybody in the establishment was against him.  She might get elected.  Let me finish.  I'm going to say, James, please.  I know you hate to hear me, but you have to see.  He's got to show these right-wingers that he's got the backbone.  You know, that's right.  Dr. Hawking, the editorial page is watching you. 
[02:24:00]  Show them you're tough.  Well, I think that's bullshit, and I hate that.  Just let it go.  Okay.  James, what do you think, though, seriously, about this Senate race, James, that basically  the Catherine Harris and Bill Nelson.  Novak walked off.  What do you think?  Why?  What will that mean?  Because he just said bullshit.  Yeah, he just walked off.  And he's sitting there thinking about it and probably started sweating.  Like, oh, shit.  Is that why somebody just said, just let him go? 
[02:24:30]  Just let it go.  Or let him go.  I don't know.  Or, yeah.  And someone's requesting.  I don't know this one.  The Swedish game show chick puking.  You can't.  It's a video, though.  It doesn't do anything to hear.  It's a video.  Yeah, right?  It does no good to hear it.  I mean, I got it in front of me.  It's not worth playing.  No, because you can't.  Well, you might hear a blah, but it's in Swedish.  Swedish puking.  Meaning that you can't hear the talking.  Like, I don't know how she recovered.  I've watched it, but you can't.  It's auditory. 
[02:25:00]  I mean.  Dan from PA.  You guys have to check out the Swedish game show host chick puking as a caller is talking.  But it's not worth playing on the radio.  Try it.  Give it a shot.  The pukes in the very beginning.  All right.  Phone ring.  Yeah, hello.  Yeah, hello.  Hey, what are you?  Niklas.  Hey, Niklas.  What are you doing?  12.  All right.  I did play that.  All right.  That is pretty good.  Oh, God.  What happens there?  She just puked.  Oh, God.  In the video, you can see her puking.  That's got to be morning sickness, right? 
[02:25:30]  Or something like that.  She was probably fucking hammered or hung over.  That's me in the parking lot.  It's hitting that nice shiny.  Wait, wait.  Hello.  Hey, what are you?  Niklas.  Hey, Niklas.  What have you done with me?  Tull.  Oh, God.  Wow.  She came back. 
[02:26:00]  I just need to talk about something now.  I have ments.  All right.  Yeah, she just continued.  She came right back?  I missed the opening of the clip.  I'm like, where does she puke?  And I had to actually rewatch it.  I'm like, wow.  Okay, she just recovered nicely.  Maybe someone put puke here on the teleprompter.  Puke at the spot.  Okay.  There's a clip on YouTube.  Somebody pukes during a drum solo and keeps going.  Wow.  Just sort of playing the snare and just like Monty Python-esque.  It's the weirdest thing because you want to laugh at him. 
[02:26:30]  But the fact that he continues.  He still plays.  That it becomes like this.  I think that's kind of a rock and roll moment.  Guy rocks.  Yeah.  We got the video.  I bet he's doing heroin.  Got the video playing right now.  I'm waiting for puke.  Tom on Long Island.  Go ahead.  Morning, guys.  How are you doing?  Yeah, that woman, on some of the videos, there were subtitles.  She puked because she explained twice to the crowd that she's having painful menstrual cramps.  Menstrual cramps.  That was because of PMS.  Wow.  How'd you like to marry that woman? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, is he puking right there?  Yeah.  She got game.  She came right back and said it, though.  Yeah.  She definitely came back.  Thanks, Tom.  This guy's rocking.  No, he's playing a great solo.  And then all of a sudden, he just, he looks to the left.  I didn't know it's a great solo.  He's so good, he pukes.  I don't know.  Yeah.  So happy with himself.  I think it's steep watching.  There he goes. 
[02:27:30]  Ho, ho.  The guy goes, ho, ho.  Is this part of the show?  Oh, he's really powerbooting.  That's why they're screaming.  But he never stops.  He doesn't stop.  Holy shit.  Wow.  He comes back again.  Oh, my.  It's like Pat from Munaki on the drum set.  That's amazing.  Oh, my God.  He still plays.  He's puking and playing.  Projectile vomiting.  Now, that's a drum solo. 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  Oh.  And he's back.  Then he goes back.  He's back.  All right.  Now he's back.  A little stage fright.  I don't know what it was.  A little heroin.  Yeah.  He puked at least, what, six to eight times?  Could have been some drinking.  Bad pussy.  Well, to put it in the context of this show, I'd say about a half gallon of eggnog.  Yeah.  Oh, good one.  Steve, anything like that ever happened in Foundry?  When you were recording Pendulum? 
[02:28:30]  Just from the audience.  Yes, exactly.  Thank you, Joe.  Ah, there's always time for a jab.  Yeah, let's say hi to Charles in Delaware.  Charles?  Good morning, guys.  I was wondering if we could hear one of the audio clips from yesterday of Bill's sweet  old grandma trying out for her first acting job.  Oh, boy.  They don't forget, Bill.  What is that?  Well, they never forgot the abuse your grandma took on this radio show.  And yesterday, we were playing eight-track porn. 
[02:29:00]  You ever hear of this?  Well, I was talking about Bill O'Reilly's grandmother, not Bill Burst.  Yes.  Dummy.  No, I know.  Oh, okay, yeah.  But this guy's trying to bring Bill Burst's grandma back into the fold.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember that.  This is, it's called, yeah, audio porn.  Okay.  It was back in, I guess, the 70s.  It was on an eight-track.  And you'd pop this in and, I don't know, jerk off to it.  It's erotic vignettes done on audio tape. 
[02:29:30]  Why are you acting like you didn't have it the second it came out, just like the iPhone?  I would not have had that.  I had an eight-track player.  Danny's working on part three.  We should have it in, I don't know, a half hour here.  The acting is horrendous.  And for some reason, they just seem angry.  They all seem angry with each other.  No matter how good the sex is going, they're just mad.  But it's so 70s.  And it's not from a porn movie. 
[02:30:00]  There was never any film to this.  It's just audio.  Like they were doing a radio show or something.  It's like the old-time radio broadcast.  Well, I'm going to fuck you in your dumper.  Well, we got the Pennsylvania 6, 9,000.  Right after this, we're going to listen to Benny Goodman.  But first, ah, yes, I'm going to fuck your mouth.  Let's play it for Bill.  Just the first clip here. 
[02:30:30]  Hello?  Hello, you fucking whore.  Honey, that's a hell of a way to talk to your best girl buddy.  What the fuck are you bitching about?  You know damn good and well what I'm talking about, you bitch.  You fucked Joe the bartender last night, and he wasn't that shit.  I sucked his joint for 30 minutes, and his prick was like a piece of spaghetti.  To crown it off, the bastard had the nerve to laugh when it wouldn't come up.  Is that the vagina monologue?  It just, doesn't that sound awful? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, that's really, yeah.  Well, this is pre-internet where anything is exciting.  What the hell is going on?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Who the hell is there?  Oh, nobody, you dumb bitch.  I couldn't wait anymore.  I'm climbing the damn walls.  Oh, I told you I had a banana up my cunt.  Oh, God, it's good.  Are these like phone sex auditions? 
[02:31:30]  A lot of food references.  This has nothing to do with anything we're familiar with.  Movies, phone sex.  Oh, you dirty bitch.  With you, anything goes.  I have to admit, when it comes to fucking, you're a genius.  I've always used carrots.  But this is smoother and thick all the way.  She prefers bananas over carrots.  Yeah, we got part three. 
[02:32:00]  Actually, we got the finale of The Delivery Boy.  Oh, good.  I thought it was over, man.  She was licking his sweaty balls when we last left her.  He had instructed her to lick his sweaty balls.  Do you actually have that one here?  No.  I have the sweaty balls.  Well, I do have sweaty balls.  Well, actually, let me just play the whole clip.  Okay.  This is where we left, everybody.  I'll play the whole clip.  And this is where we're going to pick up the story in about 10 or 15 minutes. 
[02:32:30]  But this is where we left you with the 8-track porn.  Oh, when the hell are you going to fuck me?  Don't be so damned impatient.  See?  Carol's right.  You're built like a brick shit house.  Baby, when you're sure you're working on me, I'm going to suck that sweet little cum of yours dry.  Oh, you're sucked me.  That's good.  Suck me.  Work your way down to my stomach.  This is just creepy. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Delivery Boy sounds like he's 62.  Yeah, we did that yesterday, Vinny.  You're right on with us.  It's like a delivery boy.  He's like in his 50s.  Yeah.  I'm the delivery boy.  I think you're my accountant.  See?  23 Skidoo.  Yeah.  Suck my cock or it's curtains for you.  There hasn't been a white delivery boy since 1957, man.  What the fuck? 
[02:33:30]  You know, Bill made a good point, though.  This was pre-internet, obviously.  Yeah.  And anything was exciting.  We are so jaded now by what we can find on the internet.  You just don't remember how hard it was to get really good porno.  I mean, stand-up when this was coming out was, take my mother, please.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woo!  This guy's a genius.  That's great stuff.  But 8-tracks, that's the 70s.  There had to be porn in the 70s.  Yeah, there's porn.  But there weren't many places, especially for like if you're in your teens, you know, you're 
[02:34:00]  in high school or something and you want to watch some porno.  Right.  There wasn't many places to go and get it.  You could get magazines, baby, Playboy and Penthouse or Swank.  How was that done back then?  Something like that.  Did you guys get like a reel-to-reel player?  I would get, I actually got an 8mm movie of porno.  Where did you buy it?  It was a stag reel.  No, I don't know what the fuck it was.  It's great when you're watching and the tape rips right now. 
[02:34:30]  Get the sharp tape quick.  And all my friends knew I had this thing.  I got, I don't even know where I got it from.  I think like an uncle.  I was like, here, check this out.  You got it at the Elks Club.  The Elks Club.  Here, son.  Pass this around.  You boys will like this.  It'll put hair on your chest.  It'll put as much hair on your chest as every woman's pussy in this thing.  You should see all the big, fat, hairy pussies.  And then what is, where did you watch it?  So that was just it.  I didn't have a projector to play this in.  And so I went to my school and asked if I could borrow a projector from one of the AV guys. 
[02:35:00]  And he let me borrow a projector.  And we went to a friend's house that lived like real close to the school and just watched this porno movie.  No sound because it was just, you know.  Yeah, but that must have just been the most amazing thing ever, though.  It was so great.  I was so, like, worked up and heated up.  You're, like, shaking, trying to get the film through the little gears and stuff. 
[02:35:30]  And it's just, oh, here it goes.  And then it's just some, like, it looked like it was done in a warehouse.  A long shot, kind of.  You barely got any real close-ups.  And it was just some hairy hippie guy fucking some hairy hippie chick.  And it got right to fucking.  And it was great, you know.  It was just like, oh, this is the best shit ever.  We watched it, like, 80 times.  You've always been on the cutting edge of technology.  I always had to be.  My friends are very thankful.  Wow.  Let's play the rest of the clip. 
[02:36:00]  This is where we left you guys yesterday.  And then Danny's coming in with the new stuff.  Dick with your fingers.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Now, between my legs and around my balls.  What are you doing?  I'll circle around and tie me a sheep shank.  You dumb bitch.  Now, work your way down from my shoulders.  Anything you say, you cocksucker.  Oh, that's it, baby.  Yeah, yeah.  Now down my back.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's good, baby.  Oh.  You've got a hell of a touch with your tongue. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  You're a natural-born fuck machine.  Was this looped?  What about the cheek in my ass?  This guy doesn't sound like he's actually getting his dick sucked out.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, honey.  Oh, that's great.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  That was the cliffhanger.  That's where we left you yesterday.  When we last left you, will the delivery boy get his sweaty balls licked? 
[02:37:00]  You don't have high blood pressure.  Oh, I got completely matter-of-fact it was.  Okay, now.  Lick my sweaty balls now.  All right.  Whoa, look at the time.  Lick my sweaty balls.  Like the end of Batman, remember?  Yes.  When we last left you.  Will she lick his sweaty balls?  Will he come in her face?  Is she a cocksucker?  Tune in next time.  Find out this and more.  All right.  So Danny's going to bring in the conclusion to the delivery boy. 
[02:37:30]  The thrilling conclusion.  Yeah.  And Carrot Top is here.  So we should take a quick break.  Bring Carrot Top in here and we'll continue.  All right.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Coming back with a little foundry, huh?  Foundry music?  Did you play foundry?  Oh, is that why Steve ran out of here all upset? 
[02:38:00]  You can barely hear it, though.  Crank it up, man.  Let's get to the hook.  This is Steve's fan.  This is Pendulum, right?  Of course it is.  That's his only hit.  This isn't even a hit.  Oh, it's just looped?  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Bill Burr, Stress Factory, all weekend long.  And now we say good morning to Carrot Top in studio.  Yes.  Right over here in the lounging chair.  Yeah, he's sitting on the lounging chair.  This is nice.  Yeah.  Gigantic.  It's a nice setup.  He's just, I'm working on his tricep.  I'm like, he's huge.  If he backhands me, I'm dead. 
[02:38:30]  I want to see Carrot Top.  I want to see Carrot Top comics, you know.  You're carrying crap around all day.  I want to see you just drill your fist right there.  I tell you, I mean.  Benny works out a little bit.  I think you could take it.  Yeah.  I could probably take the shot, but I don't know if I want to.  No, you don't.  Come on, man.  Gigantic.  Carrot Top.  Yeah, right?  What's he going to do to you, right?  How old are you?  42.  42?  Yeah, yeah.  How old are your biceps?  Brand new?  Brand new.  No, this is a lot of work.  This is a lot.  I was always an athlete as a kid, but I mean, yeah, it's every day. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, no shit.  Yeah, it's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work.  People tell me I have a gym body, but I mean, like, when I look at you, I'm like, that's  what a guy is.  Right.  I have to sit up because they're putting a camera on me.  I don't want to look like a guy.  Like, I don't want to look at you, Norton.  There is no, there's nothing you could do.  I know.  To look like you're in any country.  Huge.  You really are.  He's dwarfing you right now, Vinny.  He is a midget.  Vinny Brandy is a fucking midget.  You are a midget.  It's just, he's just fucking, you're jacked up.  When did you start doing that?  The s'more-ish day. 
[02:39:30]  Just, yeah.  It took that quick.  I remember.  I lived in my whole life.  I just think people were taking notice to it because there's always, you know, I just  got smaller shirts.  They come in men's.  Smaller shirts?  Yeah, that's the way.  That's the way.  I remember years ago watching you, though, and not recalling such big arms.  I tried to wear as big a shirt as I do because I knew how to use fucking shit for it.  Right.  And wear a big shirt.  The growth is a little Barry Bonds-like in terms of his...  No, it's so funny, but yeah, nothing.  Nothing?  You've never done the roids?  My dick, no.  No roids?  No, no Bonaduce.  No Bonaduce.  I, I, no.  But I saw him and he was like, how do you keep on doing that? 
[02:40:00]  He's already got the veins pop on his forehead.  He was like, he was actually injecting while he was talking to me.  How the fuck do you get this?  Some guy actually said that, though, at Mandalay Bay Poole.  Hey, it's Bonaduce.  And I was like, fuck.  Damn it.  That's the first time in my life someone's ever said that, so I need to, I need to stop  training or something.  Can you even scratch your back anymore?  I mean...  I'm not back.  It's those three shows Saturday night with all those crunks.  Slip my sweaty balls.  Yeah.  Sweaty balls. 
[02:40:30]  You must be, you must be just sick of it, though.  Like, everybody's got to be like, hey, Carrot Top, you're big.  Yeah, they do.  You ought to just really start punching people that say that.  That would be great.  It's like, don't ask fucking Carrot Top anything about his muscles.  He punches you in the face.  We took a pic together at Tough Crowd when he did Tough Crowd, and you're wearing an open  shirt, and just the definition on your pecs, and I'm just standing there like such a non-man.  Just like a little fat-faced man.  Something a little uncomfortable about you looking at the definition on his pecs.  I was feeling all good about me. 
[02:41:00]  Your arm looks like Carrot Top's cock.  And it was just showing off his bicep there.  Yeah.  It was impressive until he walked in the room.  Fuck, Carrot Top.  That's great, man.  Fuck, man.  That happens.  I'm wearing all my hate mail around, you know.  That must be it.  Yeah.  You've put a lot of shit throughout the years, man, right?  You've put a lot of bullshit.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, you know, what the fuck.  You're going to get a lot of shit during his 40-year career in comedy.  Yeah.  We were talking about that.  You're going to, anyhow, you're not going to please everybody, so. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Well, in a way, we can understand it's, we, being shock jocks, being shock jocks, have  taken some shit in New York, especially with the elite of New York radio.  They, like, don't like what we do.  They consider it a little lowbrow and things like that.  And they're constantly bashing us on message boards and things like that.  And then they, you realize, we've been here, like, fucking 10 years.  Right.  You know?  In New York alone.  So, you know, if we got fired tomorrow, they couldn't say anything. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  But still, it's like, fucking failures.  Yeah.  You know, fucking guys are going to be out of here in a month, I bet.  I get it all the time.  People are like, there'll be a comic in the club.  He'll be playing in the state theater right around the corner from me.  Never comes to say hello.  Doesn't know me.  Doesn't matter.  But there's 1,800 people.  They're lined up everywhere.  And I got some guy with 104 people in my room.  He's like, hey, prop guy.  Yeah, well, why don't you find some props, Jerkoff, because I can't put my kids through  college on your numbers.  You're fucking killing me.  But please write some prop jokes.  Props get a bad, it's like anything else you do in comedy. 
[02:42:30]  It's almost like me and Colin were talking one time about, like, planes.  I'm like, yeah, man, I can't even do this plane joke or McDonald's or whatever.  He goes, why the fuck not?  Like, why would you allow the hacks to hijack every subject like that if you got something  original?  So it's the same with props because so many shitty prop acts.  Right.  It's like a guy that's, like, really good at it.  Yeah, it did get a stigma of just, like, being a hack because so many hacks would come out  and try to do prop acts.  Well, you know, I tell the guys, the elite guys, I'll say, okay, well, write a couple  jokes.  You know, it's so easy to do.  Write some prop jokes for me right now.  Here's some shit. 
[02:43:00]  Write some jokes.  Do what you feel.  How bad is he?  Do it.  Fucking do it.  But he gave literally shit, which is hard to work with.  Well, it pisses people off because I'll be, oh, what, you know.  And they get mad at me because I'm like, listen, if a guy does what he does and he's  good at what he does, leave him the fuck alone.  And the guy's filling a theater and you can't write, he's writing a theater and I'm also  afraid.  That's why I'm saying this shit.  Let me explain before Caratop's on.  He's my spokesperson.  Let me explain before he's sat next to Vinny's room.  This is what Vinny's, he's trying to book him at his club.  Yes, right.  That's exactly what he's trying to do.  He owns a community club. 
[02:43:30]  Thank you.  And I'll tell you, Caratop, someone was trashing you, but I defended you.  You're so funny.  Let me tell you something.  He's filling the state theater.  If he wasn't this fucking big, I'd be trashing him right now.  Oh, you fool.  You didn't want him in the club, you phony cunt.  He can't speak in the club.  Exactly.  If he could be in my club, there's no room.  Vinny, he could be raping children if he fills the state theater.  You'd book him at the club.  You fucking phony.  If you're a good child raper and you're good at it, we could put you in the club.  You'll probably say to that guy with the 104 seats, no, but you know, just keep doing 
[02:44:00]  what you're doing.  No, there's 104 seats.  I never tell them to keep doing what they're doing.  Change what you're doing.  How long was the phone call that night?  So you, dude, you're like, you're selling, you're still selling a lot of tickets, man.  Because you were like, it was known, you were like a fucking over a million dollar a  year college act.  I mean, he was fucking making huge money before he was truly a famous guy.  Well, Vegas.  I'm just there every night now.  I just do the Vegas.  Yeah, Vegas thing now.  Great.  Yeah.  Wow.  You go home.  What is that like, though?  Do you just like totally avoid the casino at this point?  Yeah, for the most part, you do. 
[02:44:30]  I mean, unless you, you know, when I hit the clubs, you know.  Yeah.  But usually I do the show and you go home.  Or the Bunny Ranch.  I've heard.  The Bunny Ranch.  Yeah, it's always fun.  It's a little far from Vegas, but.  You fuck a lot of broads there?  I'm going to pull a train with Carrot Top.  Carrot Top.  I won't be the lead.  I'll just take the fucking, I'll take what he's done with because I don't want to fucking  follow that.  You know, Regis, I was asking the same thing yesterday.  Regis was like.  Yeah, yeah.  How about the Bunny Ranch?  How many girls do you fuck over there?  Tell me, Carrot Top.  Do you pull out the props when you bagger these chicks? 
[02:45:00]  I'm Regis.  I do, yeah.  He's just.  Carrot Top is in the Bunny Ranch and does push-ups.  Where can I warm up?  You should have pulled out on Regis' show a healthy heart.  You're awful.  What the hell is that thing?  There ain't one stitch in that.  You live in Vegas?  Yeah.  Makes it a little easier.  You must have a nice spread out there. 
[02:45:30]  It's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah?  It's all right.  It's all right.  I bet you it's pretty impressive.  You live near anybody?  Michael Jackson.  You live near.  Really?  Not a joke.  Yeah, like two streets over.  I thought he lived in the Middle East.  He lives in.  No, he lives in the north central of Vegas.  So that was all fake footage?  I don't know.  So you just got him out in the sand?  Yeah.  Said he was in Saudi Arabia.  He's actually in Vegas?  That's the word on the street that he's got.  That's his house.  You can see the Ferris wheel and it's kind of weird.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  You're going to be testifying soon. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  What did you see coming out of the house?  A little hairlish Asian boy.  Vietnamese boys.  Explain to us with this toilet bowl with wheels.  Could you just tell us what happened?  No, it would be a stockade with a tear bucket.  That's what Michael uses.  How long ago and what made you just decide, I'm going to put these two things together,  take it on stage?  Yeah, I'm not a good comic like these other comics, the stand-ups, and I knew that right  away.  I was just, I had the visual thing. 
[02:46:30]  Did you try it on stage, like regular straight stand-up comedy?  Yeah, I played stand-up, and I had like one or two props, and it turned out to be what  it worked.  It was like a neighbor, a crime watch sign or something.  And I had, hey, how good is a crime watch?  They're not watching their signs.  You know, it's like a good fucking sign.  That's good.  Jackson, the lady that used to book a club, who now I think manages Larry the Cable  Guy or something, so it's interesting.  Oh, he's making shit money.  Yeah, I'm talking about money.  Yeah, poor guy, we should have a benefit for him.  He's got to make 50, 60 bucks a night.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, a lot of dough.  I don't know, just got to work down is what it was, you know?  I had a billion comics saying, lose the fucking props.  And I'm like, I'm carrying them.  You don't have to worry about them.  Do you still make these things yourself, or do you just design them and have somebody  else build them for you?  Yeah, I have a sweat kit.  There's like this fucking, I just picture the Carrot Top Factory, like you're sitting  there drawing up these blueprints that are all, it started out with you just in the garage.  It's not that exciting, it's just duct tape and glued on and tried.  Yeah.  I used to remember the legendary Wood, who's another prop actor that comedians love, and  he's just a fucking animal. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  He just throws his shit all over the floor.  People want to punch him in the face under the show because he's like aggressive with  the audience.  He's like, he's holding a strainer over his head, and he goes, I'm under a fucking strain.  Yeah.  Just laugh.  Yeah.  I'm under a fucking strain.  You look back on props, acts, jokes that you did at the beginning and think, oh, that  sucked, how did I do that?  Because comics look back and they say, you know, that sucked when I did that.  Why are you explaining to him what comics do you mean?  I'm sorry, you know what I mean?  I don't like to ask straight questions, but I want to know, does he look back and say,  I think he looks back and says, yeah, my writing's gotten better or clever. 
[02:48:00]  I don't know.  It was a serious question.  Hold on.  It was a great question, Vinny.  Yeah, let me ask you another question.  Yeah, great question, Vinny.  We're having a lot of laughs there.  You just decided to turn it in to meet the press?  Why don't you go back in the glass booth for a little while?  Take a time out, will you?  Time out for Vinny.  Time out for Vinny.  It hurts.  Your mic's off.  Goodbye.  Let me ask you another fun Vinny question.  Caratop, did the laughs cover the tears?  I'm sorry.  I'm a comedian.  Oh. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  Just a fucking comment.  I know.  I wanted to know.  Well, you know what?  It's like you became, I mean, just the name alone was such a, it's like, there's  people recognize that name, Caratop.  Everybody knows the name Caratop's a fucking comedian.  I mean, people that don't know comic names recognize that name, even if they don't know  the material, haven't seen the act.  Right.  All right.  That wasn't a question.  No, that really wasn't.  Not only was it a statement.  It was a boring movie.  It was as funny as anything I did.  I think early on in the club, like, you want everyone to like you.  You go to a comic, you go there, you want the comic, you want to get booked. 
[02:49:00]  So there's a lot of clubs that didn't book me because I did props.  I'd kill them.  They'd say, he does props.  He's not going to play this club.  So that kind of stuff.  Earlier on, you're like, this sucks.  And then you move on.  Like you say, you play state theater and fuck you.  You won't book me your club.  I'm going to play the theater.  Like, you don't get enough attention with the hair and the biceps that you paint your  fingernails.  I actually shaved my nuts for this, too.  Did you shave your nuts, too?  No payoff there, but I did.  When?  I have no idea.  You just decided?  I don't care about anything. 
[02:49:30]  You just want to?  I don't care about this.  I don't care about anything.  I don't care about anything.  Isn't it a fucking nut shit for what I do anyhow?  It's like, no one's going to say, oh, and now he paints his nails, too.  No, you could fucking, you could do anything.  If you dress like Oscar De La Hoya, no one would give a flying fuck if you were in a  tutu and a little.  That's the name of his next special.  Those photos of me will surface soon, so.  Are there?  Yeah.  We all have them somewhere, don't we?  If you're a rock star, it's like, wow, this guy's really eccentric and he's really cool,  but if you're a comic, people are like, have you lost your fucking life? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, it's true.  Did, what the fuck?  Oh, yeah, the roast.  That, you did it for.  That's more like your kind of stuff.  That was not, I think that's why they had me there.  Flavor, flavor, flavor.  Flavor, flavor.  Yeah, I mean, the roast in general is like, how many times did you say black?  Black pussy.  Yeah.  Did you want to kill Greg Giraldo?  Did you want to fucking.  I actually, I think he's very funny.  He's one of my favorite, like, roasters.  Yeah.  He's very funny.  But he was giving you some shit.  Well, sure, yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to get shit.  I'll take shit for, like, you work out or something.  And they say, oh, something stupid.  Like, look at his fucking face.  What the fuck is his face? 
[02:50:30]  Look at it.  What the fuck happened to you?  You're like, what the fuck's wrong with my face?  You know, thinking.  Or you can rip my axe, because that's pretty common.  But I guess.  Yeah.  You're looking like I look like.  It went for a new angle.  That's right.  Roasts are fucking, like, brutal.  No, it's brutal.  It was all me for the first.  It's all been edited.  The first hour was just me.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I think we're roasting him.  I think when you get a bunch of comics like that together.  I knew it was going to happen.  And they talk about you when you're not there.  When you're there in a roast atmosphere, it's like you just fucking.  Yeah.  You were there. 
[02:51:00]  No, it's brutal.  Are you talking about this clip?  Yeah.  Walk up.  Oh, great.  Oh, you got a clip?  That's nice.  Oh, fucker.  You are a big, ghoulish woman.  I'm talking to you, Carrot Top.  A ghoulish woman.  Jesus.  What happened to your face?  Jesus.  You look retarded.  How did you do that?  What the fuck?  Right.  It's nice.  You should have punched him.  How did you find a plastic surgeon who could add a chromosome?  He's calling you a retard. 
[02:51:30]  Well, I mean, I will assess that back and say, that was funny.  You appreciate the brutality as a comic.  Everyone got ripped on.  Everyone got ripped on.  Yeah, that roast was unreal.  But if you look at those old roasts that they had when it was Dean Martin and stuff,  dude, it was nothing.  No.  Like they were.  No.  They've gotten back.  It was gentle ribbing.  Well, they...  Right.  But now it's just like, your mother's a cunt.  It's just...  Woo!  Right, right. 
[02:52:00]  True.  It is.  And they would co-sign for each other's stuff back then.  Like, who was the guy who always pretended he was drunk?  Foster Brooks.  Foster Brooks.  They would all laugh and stuff, right?  If today, Patrice would get up, you're not drunk.  You're not drunk.  Yeah, just sell him out in front of everybody.  Just fuck him.  Speaking of that, did you guys see on YouTube that clip of Jamie Foxx just trashing that  guy while the guy was trying to roast somebody?  No.  Oh, my God.  He kills him.  He was... 
[02:52:30]  Jamie Foxx was the host of it, so he had a lapel mic that was on, and this dude came  up.  It was like an Emmett Smith roast, and he starts bombing, and Jamie starts speaking into his  mic.  Oh, shit.  Doing the guy's inner thoughts, like, I just told another joke that didn't work.  Maybe I should just get off.  It was fucking...  It was hilarious, but it was one of the most brutal things I've ever seen.  I gotta see that one.  Here it is.  I want to actually see a YouTube video of Bill Burr watching YouTube videos.  Yeah, that's all I do.  Every fucking video.  You want any...  You know what?  Go for it.  Slap fight or any animal thing. 
[02:53:00]  You know them all.  I watched them all.  Yeah.  Love them.  We'll get that on the radio in a minute or two, because it's really long.  Let's say hi to Greg in California.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, I'm on a carrot top.  I gotta congratulate you on one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen on TV.  Hey, you kissed Gene Simmons on national TV.  That was awesome.  Did you?  Yeah, I did.  On his show?  You did.  I don't know.  They just were doing some stupid...  Family values.  That's when I painted my nails that day.  Oh, okay.  Now it all makes sense.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  No, I don't know.  They kept saying, we're doing these intros, you know, the Gene Simmons thing.  Kiss on lips?  No.  I said, we were doing like little bumpers with the show, and I said, listen, I'll be  upstairs or something.  And they kept doing something stupid.  They said, keep fucking with them.  Keep fucking with them.  I said, what else do I do?  Yeah.  I said, I'll be upstairs.  I wasn't going to come out completely naked, because there was only like 10 people there.  And I was going to come out and say, I'll stay upstairs or something.  And I kissed him on the back of his ear, and he was like, what the fuck?  And he really wasn't happy with it.  No.  No.  He's kind of looking at me like, you don't fucking kiss Gene Simmons. 
[02:54:00]  I'm like, your producer said to do it.  He said, push it furthest I can push it.  So, does that don't blow you?  You're giving the choice.  You're watching A&E.  Let's go to Catherine in Atlanta.  Catherine, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey, I have to tell you, you did the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life at George  Oh, I kissed Gene Simmons.  Back in like 92 or something.  Jesus.  That's when I was funny.  That's it.  That's it, 92. 
[02:54:30]  What was it?  What was it?  He smashed his watermelon.  No, he ordered a pizza from Domino's in Statesboro, Georgia.  And our local pizza guy was like a retarded guy.  And he came up on stage.  Carrot Top made him wear a pair of women's underwear.  And then he played.  I am funny with the retards.  And strobe lights with him.  All right.  I do remember that.  So, you took advantage of a retarded person on stage.  It's the funniest thing you've ever done.  Ever done.  And it was in 92.  Thank you.  What a backhanded compliment that cunt just gave him. 
[02:55:00]  I did 92.  Not since then you've done much, but 92 is really great.  You did the funniest thing.  I walked into your dressing room and the retarded pizza guy was there.  And you were fingering his ass.  And you and your whole crew were laughing at him.  That retarded pizza boy is still in Carrot Top's trailer.  It was 1989.  Get the retarded pizza boy.  We stiffed him on the pizza.  It was a rough night for him.  We told him we paid him and he ate the money.  And he cried and punched himself until his parents came.  Some people don't understand what a compliment is.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Some fucking guy over the weekend.  I forget where it was.  It might have been Riley's when I was over there over the weekend.  Comes up and he's saying some shit like, he goes, man, I loved your show.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  He goes, when you guys were at NEW, that was when you guys were so fucking funny.  I was like, thanks.  He goes, you guys used to be like, so fuck.  All right, shut the fuck up.  You know?  That was five years ago.  Thanks, buddy.  And the guy wouldn't even tell you.  He goes, no, it's like so much shit and stuff that you can't do. 
[02:56:00]  He goes, you guys, man, we're so fucking don't want to hear how funny I was.  God, what a douche.  They say, even in the casino, they go, you know, I hate you.  I've always hated you.  You're annoying.  I don't like you.  But I came because my wife wanted me to come.  And it was really better than I thought it was going to be.  Yeah.  Fuck with that.  It didn't totally suck.  I have to set it up.  I fucking hate you, first of all.  Yeah.  Let's set some standards.  Nothing.  I don't like anything about you. 
[02:56:30]  You're stupid.  You know all that.  Yeah.  But you did have fun.  He goes, all right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it was just okay.  Yeah, thanks.  Hey, Billy wants in here.  Billy in New York.  What's up?  Hey, Carrot Top, I'm a huge fan, dude.  I thought you were great as fucking Rocky Dennis and the Matthew retarded ginger.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, mother fucker.  To make Rocky Dennis jokes is always appropriate.  And then you see how quickly he hung up because he was afraid he would somehow be able to punch  him through the phone. 
[02:57:00]  That's great.  Oh, fuck.  I'll find him.  Yeah, you'll get him.  Track him down.  Has it ever gotten to you really badly?  Like, any bullshit?  Like, where it's like, all right, man, this is fucking hurtful.  Oh, no, not really.  No.  He doesn't care about anything.  He doesn't give a flying fuck anymore.  No, Dennis Miller one time was kind of giving me a lot of, back in the day, was giving me  grief about stuff.  I opened for him, and I was at a college.  And I got there, and it was at Wake Forest or something.  And they said, you got to do, you know, 30 minutes.  And I said, I got 20, maybe. 
[02:57:30]  And 15 was okay.  So I said, I'll do, I'll stretch.  So I get there, and I look in the wings, and he's standing there.  I remember thinking, oh, God damn, it's Dennis Miller.  He's only, he's little.  I remember thinking, oh, fucking little he is.  So I'm doing my thing.  I'm looking over, and he's just pacing, and he's doing like, what the fuck?  And I'm looking, and I said, I've only been up here like nine minutes.  So he's like, come on.  And the guy's like, get off.  So I'm like, leave all my shit here.  He's like, just get off.  So I walked off, and I said, walked by him, and he says, you went too fucking long.  So as he walked by him, he did his set.  He didn't feel good that night. 
[02:58:00]  He kept checking on the Braves game.  He kept saying, where's the Braves and the so-and-so winning?  It was whatever series that was.  Right.  And I came off, and I said, Dennis, it was great.  And he says, first thing you do is buy a fucking watch, and don't go watch your time.  And I said, I was supposed to do 30 minutes.  I did 10.  What a douche.  Now then, but later on, he came back, and he was like, hey, what's up, Topper?  You know how he is?  Yeah.  Hey, thanks.  I never went long, though.  Did he get out on stage?  I wanted to get clear with you that I didn't.  But no, he went on every show for about a year saying, Mike Topper.  The guy took longer than Pederocles took to conquer the Venetia Lufens. 
[02:58:30]  What?  What?  Standing over here like.  The crowd didn't quite get him.  Yeah, because I was holding him.  Hey, look, it's a boot with a kickstand.  It was easy.  It's shiny.  Look.  And they're like, yeah, it's college.  Hit a pinwheel.  Yeah.  10 minutes.  He gets up there.  All smug.  I'm standing there like fucking quick, quick, for Christ's sake.  I feel like it's 1540, and I'm here in the. 
[02:59:00]  What?  We made up.  We made up.  Oh, did you?  Can't pop her with a shitty head shake.  It's just a few.  Fuck him.  You fucking button bottom suit.  Fuck him unless he's on this show.  Absolutely.  That's what we say.  I didn't like the way he didn't defend the O&A thing.  I didn't like the way he didn't defend the show.  Well, it's not like it's the freedom of space.  Shut the fuck up.  That is a great, what, center square, right?  In Hollywood Square, as you just did.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Charles Nelson Miller.  No.  What the fuck?  He's Michael K. Fox, Miller, and Ed. 
[02:59:30]  God.  Hey, how you doing?  I don't have power to fuck you.  I'm an answer.  Oh.  Yeah, he trashed us, too.  Yeah, I know he did.  We were in our latest problem there.  Like it wasn't a real freedom of space.  Hey, E-Rock, really fast.  Sandy Kane's here.  Did you meet Sandy Kane in the green room?  I did not.  Hope not.  She was allegedly raped by Phil Spector back in the day.  She's an old, like, burlesque dancer.  She's been doing our show for years, but...  She's, uh...  Let's bring her in.  She's crazy.  Well, but, uh...  Really.  Literally.  A little observation.  I guess the K-Rock people are going into the green room. 
[03:00:00]  Why?  They heard her coming in, and people from K-Rock have been peeking into the green room.  She's just sitting there staring at the wall.  Eh, eh.  So people have just been peeking their head in to see what she's doing.  She hasn't moved.  You want to bring her in real fast?  Yeah.  She's dead.  Bring in Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  Where are you putting her?  Right for you.  No.  She's not going to hurt you.  No, no, no, no, no.  She goes back by E-Rock.  No, no, no.  Yeah, just sit on Karatot's lap.  I'm not going over there.  Oh, God. 
[03:00:30]  Hey, and what's coming in?  Make sure she's far away from me.  Oh.  Is she going to do a little thing on the stripper pole like she used to?  What mic we used to do?  Years ago.  Bye, Vinny.  Bye, Vinny.  Sorry, Vinny.  Vinny's going to the bullpen.  Why are you taking Vinny's mic?  Vinny, you can move over there to E-Rock's mic.  Yeah, move over to E-Rock's mic.  Just because we're keeping Sandy Kane away from everybody.  Yeah, we want to keep her away.  Is she here or what?  She gets crazy.  Bring her in.  She was in the far away green room.  Oh, okay.  She's sitting there like dilly-bop in the beginning of Sling Blade, just staring out that window. 
[03:01:00]  Dilly-bop.  She used to dance in Times Square when Times Square was really seedy and bottomless and  shit like way back in the 70s.  The good old days.  Yeah, the good old days.  Yeah, the good old days.  Now it's like, here she is.  The world down there.  I know.  I like the fun old days.  Look at her.  Here she is.  Oh, wow.  Now I can see why I raped her.  How have you been?  Okay, I'm still breathing here.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Hi, Cowatop.  How are you?  Wow. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  I brought dildo with me.  You're like cauliflower top.  Cauliflower top.  My titties were sweaty in the green room.  Evil can evil and Dolly Parton fuck.  I didn't hear that.  I said, you look great this morning.  No, he puts things together.  You just put that together.  He's perfect.  Put things together.  That's why I brought dildo with me because I need protection here. 
[03:02:00]  Is that the name of your dog?  I brought dildo with me.  Yeah, we know about dildo.  You always bring dildo with you.  It really is a dildo.  She sounds like a character actor from the 70s.  No, I don't want that.  Don't even try.  Stay there or Steve will.  Can you stand over?  You got to put the mic by your mouth.  You can't talk into a dildo.  No, don't.  The microphone.  The collagen is interfering with the microphone.  Which one's the dick?  Is it a mic or a dick? 
[03:02:30]  Her hat just fell off her head.  I wish her head was in it.  Her hat actually jumped out of the leg.  I think the wig stayed there.  Her hat just keeps moving.  Oh, my God.  Joke.  I know I'm doing this movie about Dolly Parton.  Oh, you are?  Yeah, I wanted to do this song called Rock Around Dolly Parton's Twat.  So I'm wondering if that's possible to do that.  Is that possible?  But we don't believe you're actually doing a Dolly Parton movie.  Yeah, it's set in the 80s. 
[03:03:00]  Dolly, we got to go back to the future.  Hey, you know, she's a big star.  In this one, she gets run over by the DeLorean.  So let me do that song.  We're rocking around Dolly Parton's Twat.  Are you really?  Yeah, we'll let you get to the song.  It's been so long since we've seen you.  I know.  I'm the same.  I'm the same.  Well, not really.  I'm not?  Yeah.  Why not, Opie? 
[03:03:30]  A few more miles on you.  They're all bad miles.  Ah!  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I have that hemorrhoid, and I never let anyone fuck me, my asshole.  Wow.  Okay.  Do you really have a roid?  Jesus.  He doesn't believe you have a roid.  Wait, can you show Carrot Top?  Hey, hey, hey.  Which one?  She has a few hemorrhoids?  Carrot Top.  She's got a...  I got a hemorrhoid, but it really works for me.  It's a genital wart.  I've never let any man fuck me in my asshole. 
[03:04:00]  And even when they raped me, I said, no, please don't.  You know what I mean?  Listen.  You know what?  You look like a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader opened the Ark of the Covenant.  That's why they made the cheerleaders move away from the other team's sidelines.  That's exactly.  Sandy.  Sandy Cain.  Show Carrot Top Twato.  And show Vinny.  Vinny has not seen it.  Just move. 
[03:04:30]  Vinny, man.  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  Badass and Jewish?  Is he Jewish?  Do the name like that?  Are you Jewish?  Vibrating.  Yeah.  Is he serving signs?  Look how she's doing like this.  Enough, dildo.  Look how she's doing this porno humor, and then her jokes are from 1912.  Funny is funny, as Buddy Hackett would say.  Exactly.  All right.  If he wasn't dead, we understand.  Dead.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  Who wants to do my big titties, man? 
[03:05:00]  I want to do your hemorrhoid, do I?  Okay.  Yes.  I brought my big titties.  Sandy!  Hey!  Fuck.  Show Carrot Top Twato.  It's SM, right?  Twat.  Cunt.  Steve, will you control this beast?  I mean, I love words like that.  Show him Twato.  Twato.  Remember Twato?  I forgot how frustrating she could be.  Now she'll just take pictures.  Hey, Jim.  Remember when you were first getting into the clubs in New York?  This is the kind of person you'd run into in like the New York comedy club.  Okay, Jim.  What do you want me to say about you? 
[03:05:30]  Show him.  No, show Twato.  Where's Twato on the front?  You do crack?  Who does crack?  Oh, we do.  Okay.  Play along.  Play along.  Remember Twato in the front?  Let me see Twato.  No, no.  I haven't seen Twato in years.  Show Carrot Top.  I'm not looking.  Come over and look at it.  Not too close.  Right there is good.  Right there.  Jesus.  Right there.  Right there is good.  I can't like to tell my family.  Look at what this is.  Don't freak me out. 
[03:06:00]  It'll freak out.  Okay.  Where is it?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Did I bring it?  Move your hand.  Uh-oh.  It's okay.  Move your hand.  My O.B. and Anthony G-String.  Move your hand.  Show.  I got my O.B. and Anthony G-String.  Ew.  The worst thing in life.  All right.  No.  Pull that aside.  No.  Show.  Show Twato.  Why would you look at that?  No, it's not embarrassing.  That's what I want to know.  Why would anybody look at that?  What is that?  Oh, Jesus.  What is that?  It's a pop.  I thought I was going to die a few years ago when they had the doctor show. 
[03:06:30]  Remember?  Oh, my God.  Wait, I'm still here.  Wait, wait.  Carrot Top has.  The inspector's pistol when you need it.  Right?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Carrot Top.  Comment?  I thought it was going to be a cock you were going to pull out of there.  Oh, yeah.  A cock and then it's like an ear.  No, well.  Did it get bigger?  Did anyone see it?  It's big.  That is seen in the old days?  Yeah, it's pretty big.  Same size?  All right.  Go back by the mic.  Get it back by the mic over there.  No, no, no.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Shut up.  Jimmy, I'll kill you.  I don't even know what that is.  That may be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the weird thing, too.  Jesus, you said I'd make him.  Has it got closer?  It's the whole thing.  The whole thing.  Yeah, the whole package.  The whole thing.  No, the whole thing.  I'm going to ask you to.  Her fucking...  Shut up, Sandy.  Shut up.  Her genital wart looks like something that SETI uses to search for extra intelligence.  One of those giant things that Jodie Foster should stand under.  That'd be kind of hot, though.  Just to be like you're eating around and just kind of suck on that thing.  We had a guy come in and do that. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, I actually did have a guy.  From the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah, Paul O.  Why wouldn't we?  With something available like that, a prop.  It's a prop.  Caratop, can you tape something to that and somehow come up with a closing bit?  We should give Caratop ten minutes in the green room.  Ten minutes and some duct tape.  Yeah, ten minutes.  You got duct tape in that.  Go.  Fucking general.  Is the hair on your dick red like that?  Or what?  It doesn't look anything like yours.  Yeah.  See, I've red blood here.  Oh, God.  She keeps it nice and coiffed. 
[03:08:00]  I know.  It's a little bit like Opie's hair.  She's in great shape for a...  Even if you keep yourself in great...  Oh, you look horrific.  How old are you really?  I'm a woman of the 90s.  93.  Okay.  How old is the general goiter?  Well, I think that...  You know how really I think I got it?  I was shaving.  I was working at this place called the Las Vegas Bar.  It was totally nude.  You couldn't even wear socks or an anklet.  And I was waiting for 40 seconds to eat.  And you woke up and they had it on you? 
[03:08:30]  And I shaved and then all of a sudden that growth came.  Couldn't wear socks.  I'm pretty sure that's how it happened.  I wasn't born with it, man.  Right after shaving, did you fuck a motorcycle gang?  It could also be from all the cock that fucked you.  She looks like she used to weigh 400 pounds and somehow lost it all.  In 20 minutes.  What happened to your pussy hair?  It looks like Fred Mertz's head.  Fred Mertz's head. 
[03:09:00]  No, I don't want to see a hammer.  Oh, my God.  Now, wait a minute.  I can see a hemorrhoid.  Yeah, there's a hemorrhoid.  Why would you not have that removed?  Show me the roid.  I didn't see it.  I don't believe you have one.  It's another general wart.  Show Jimmy the roid.  It's dangling down there pretty good.  Just open your asshole, please.  It's like a cow udder.  You want to smell my ass?  It's really good.  Your carrot top's disgusted.  I have a great smelling ass.  No, shut up.  Stop it.  It couldn't be any worse than your jokes.  Fucking show me your asshole.  Wait.  Hold on.  Should we have Pat Duffy smell her ass? 
[03:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Bring in Pat Duffy.  Bring in Pat Duffy.  Fucking Pat Duffy.  It's fucking Pat Duffy.  Fucking Pat Duffy.  Wow.  Turn that hat around.  You're going into battle.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Pat fucking Duffy.  And his Amish beard.  That's right.  We'll go into battle here.  We want you to smell Sandy's asshole.  Because we really think that's a general war.  We don't want you to get, like, a war on your nose.  Yeah.  I look like a witch.  Just sniff her asshole. 
[03:10:00]  I look like a fucking witch.  Get close.  Get a good sniff.  And let us know.  Steve, control this shit.  Open it up.  Open your ass cheeks, Sandy.  Spread them.  All right.  Get down there.  Pat Duffy will smell Sandy Kane's ass to see if it does indeed smell good.  Get in there.  Open it.  Get in.  All right.  Open your ass.  Bill Burr at the Stress Factory.  Open your ass.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Get in.  Bill Burr at the Stress Factory this weekend, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  5, 4, 5, 4, 2, 4, 2.  All right.  Pat, what's the matter?  I've had shit.  And that was worse. 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  We might have found something that Pat can't handle.  One more whiff, Pat.  One more whiff.  One more whiff.  A good one.  One more whiff.  One show Thursday.  Open it up, Sandy.  Open it.  Open up the ass.  Open it.  Open it.  Open up the ass.  Go ahead, Pat.  Get in there.  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday.  It's like an old attic.  He's cringing, and that's from a man who brushed his teeth with dog shit.  I had a puke in his face.  Yeah.  Wow.  You all right, Pat?  Yeah, I'm fine.  That was just...  Yeah.  What are you doing later, man?  It's like smelling salt. 
[03:11:00]  If you pass out, just get Sandy.  Squat over your nose.  Can you smell her vag, too?  Just smell it.  All right.  Sure.  All right.  Good sport.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Let him smell your vag.  Open it up.  Open up that vag.  Carrot Top, can you believe you ever got shit for being a prop act ever?  I was just going to say, ever?  I was just going to say, I know.  Can you believe it?  Unbelievable.  And then sniff your finger.  No, Sandy.  No, no.  There's going to be no touching of your pussy.  Sniff your finger.  I swear I was going to say that.  Let him just smell it.  He's not going to touch it.  He's not touching your pussy.  Open the lips. 
[03:11:30]  There's not a man in this room that's going to touch your pussy.  It's not that my pussy smells.  It's the G-string.  It's like she lost 100 pounds in a day.  I can't believe she draws lines anywhere.  She doesn't.  Just spread your pussy and let Hal Roach fall out.  All right.  You don't have to.  Open the pussy.  Hey, Jack.  Why?  Wait, wait, wait.  Steve, why are you miking her vag?  The vag doesn't claw.  I'm waiting until his face gets closer. 
[03:12:00]  All of a sudden, he's miking her vag.  Steve the bear blocking everything.  I'm loving him right now.  Yeah, you got a $50.  Put the confederate money back in your fucking garter.  You got to pay with a pelt.  Hallelujah, man.  Jesus, really.  I'm a Christian here, you know.  Steve.  All right.  Steve.  One of the originals.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now you can.  All right.  She's got to pull her pussy open.  Yeah.  Pull it open.  Hey, this.  Open it.  Open.  Pull it aside so you can get a good whiff. 
[03:12:30]  Pull that aside.  Now get in there.  She's not opening her pussy.  Wait, wait, wait.  What does it smell like?  Once again with the attic musty, never been.  It's fucking terrible.  Never been fucked smell.  Never been fucked.  Wow.  Nothing tells me.  It's awful.  Well, you know what?  I don't know.  Can you hear hits from the 60s in there?  Hold on.  The wall of sound.  The wall of sound.  The wall of sound. 
[03:13:00]  The wall of sound.  You just smelled Richard Pryor's 30-year-old cum.  Oh, shit.  Linger and longer.  Oh, God.  You know what, Ope?  I'm not convinced in her asshole.  I think Pat's playing enough.  I think the only way to tell is for someone else to smell her asshole as well.  Step up to the plate, Norton.  I think our own E-Rock should just not touch it, but I think that E-Rock should take a whiff.  E-Rock, what do you think?  I think so.  Yeah, E-Rock, come on.  I think so.  You've been messing up lately.  This will get you back in our good grades. 
[03:13:30]  I'm thinking about Andy Williams right now.  I don't know why.  Make her open it.  Make her open the cheese.  Smelt this smell in a while.  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh, I know who that is.  Turn around.  Look at Phan.  Phan's got the bucket.  Phan's got the bucket.  Phan's got the bucket.  Phan's got the bucket.  Phan's got the bucket.  Phan's got the bucket.  Phan's got the bucket.  That was child's play.  Don't worry about it.  Child's play for Pat Buck and Duffy.  Okay.  We have to go to confession here today.  All right.  Open the asshole.  Pull it down and open it.  Does she ever get tired of bombing?  This is just the worst.  I apologize, Carrotop.  Sandy, open it.  Open up your asshole.  You pull that string aside. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  Hold on to that.  Spread it open.  All right.  We do have a bucket nearby because there's no way E-Rock is surviving this.  There's no way.  I got five bucks.  This will tough it out.  You think?  Five bucks.  All right.  You're on, man.  A good sniff.  Five bucks.  Hang in there, E-Rock.  Okay.  He's going to puke.  Bend over more.  Come on.  Hang in there.  I want to go buy a breakfast croissant.  Oh, he's done.  He's done.  Wait.  That's only the first sniff.  You got it. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, God.  Karen Top, what are you here to promote again?  I'm trying to get a plug-in.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God damn.  Now I'm going to ask.  Karen Top, two shows at the Luxor.  Hold on.  That's only the back end.  He still has to smell the front end.  E-Rock, how was it?  E-Rock, how was it?  E-Rock, what was it smell like? 
[03:15:00]  Like an open coffin.  That is horrible.  You got to smell the front.  Yeah, you got to smell the front and then you're done.  Don't touch it.  Anthony, you sure you understand why Bill Moyers doesn't respect you as a journal?  I can understand now.  Didn't Regis do this, too?  Come on.  Smell her cunt.  I want you to get it.  Get your nose in there, Gilman.  Get your nose in.  All right.  Here we go.  The front end. 
[03:15:30]  Fatty Arbuckle.  He pulled her uterus up with a Coke bottle.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Front end for E-Rock.  Here we go.  He said he didn't do it.  This is horrible.  Thank you, Prince.  We're all over our twat.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  E-Rock is getting ready.  A broken bottle.  Pull that aside, Sandy.  You're cheating.  You're cheating.  Fatty Arbuckle.  Come on.  Charlie Chaplin was quite a ladies' man. 
[03:16:00]  Get in there.  Here we go.  Hold on.  Eat with E-Rock or I'll rip your hat off.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  I know you don't want to, but you have to.  Go ahead.  All right.  Here we go.  E-Rock.  Move it in.  Eat with E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, there he goes.  Wait, he's kind of gagging.  Come on.  That was half a sniff.  All right.  That was not a good one.  Come on.  Be a fucking man.  First of all, get in there.  Get in there.  She grabbed the back of his head.  Come on, Sandy.  E-Rock.  What happened?  Yeah, wait.  Something went wrong.  Wow.  Pull it from the other side, Sandy. 
[03:16:30]  Don't eat out.  I'll tell you that.  Sandy.  No.  Pull it from the other side.  Oh, zippity-doo-da.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, you're doing that, Sandy.  This is it.  From that side.  E-Rock, a good sniff, man.  Come on.  Come on, E-Rock.  Look at that thing.  She is dressed in the good.  Oh, God.  She did a USO gig in the Civil War.  So, how are we doing, everybody? 
[03:17:00]  With all my amputees.  The blue and the gray.  E-Rock, now smell it with the lip.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  His face is a crisis.  Here we go.  He can't take E-Rock.  Going in.  Come on, E-Rock.  Give us a smell.  No touching.  Good sniff.  Big sniff.  You okay?  Oh, no.  Oh, he's spitting his hand.  E-Rock.  What, are you getting ready?  Come on. 
[03:17:30]  What does it smell like?  David Ortiz.  What does it smell like?  Embalming fluid.  You smell like someone died.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I am, too.  Eh.  That is something.  That poor pussy is.  When was the last time you've been laid?  Well, I could have gotten laid, but I said no.  Why?  Because I'm scared.  I'm scared.  Yeah?  A guy who put his big dick in me, man, and then break my fucking heart.  Forget about it.  Break your heart, your neck. 
[03:18:00]  Fucker.  I'm saying he was cute, too, but, you know, I have to, like, you know, I might fall apart.  He was cute?  He was very, and he's in radio, too.  Oh, Jesus.  He's a program director for radio.  Yeah, how you doing?  We're about the same age.  He was very drunk at the time.  Had to meet Joe Franklin.  Joe Franklin comes to us.  I was going to go with Cousin Brucey by fitting people to the punch.  Joe Franklin and I, we had sex in the bathroom at Joe Franklin's comedy club.  I am?  Yeah, very limp. 
[03:18:30]  What year?  No shit, he's fucking you.  I don't think it was Joe's fault.  It comes without saying.  Joe Franklin.  Give him a dick hurt.  He's a tad.  And he smelled my pussy, too, and he was like, he liked it.  He's, you know, yes, he did.  This is what Sandy Cain's saying.  We don't know.  She's lying.  She's crazy.  She just lies.  It was back in 91 when I was funny.  That's when it happened.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And he had to duct tape a tongue depressor to his cock to fuck me.  Sandy, what else you got today?  I don't think Joe Franklin ever fucked anyone, really.  Did you have a song you were going to sing?  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Can I sing it?  What is that?  It's fuck around.  It's rock around Dolly Parton's twat.  All right.  You're just funny the way you word things.  What?  Unfortunately, you got to put headphones on that we're going to have to destroy after you.  Where is it?  Can I do this topless?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, please.  Yeah.  Do it like that.  No, topless.  Without a head.  Where's Tom Chiasano when you need him?  Exactly.  She has like four bros on.  Yeah.  She needs it.  Of course. 
[03:19:30]  She's 80.  She needs it.  Tied into a sailor's knot.  Hold these titties up now.  Because they're real.  They're not implants, Coward Top.  They can't stay up with three bras on them.  This is the new movie, Parton Medali.  What studio is doing this movie?  It's involved with the Rolling Stones' Apco.  Yeah, sure.  I hope it's a snuff film.  Fantasyland film presents.  Would you believe it's really...  Dolly Parton gets killed when she's 90. 
[03:20:00]  That fucking rickety hat is really annoying me.  Wait, wait.  Rickety.  Disgusting.  You know, you're not an American, man.  It's all about the USA.  Is it?  Yes.  Toby Keith's sister is here.  Yeah.  Sing it.  Who's this guy?  Oh, he's Kenny.  This is my pasties, they say Sandy Ken.  Oh, okay.  Oh, good.  You got pasties on.  That's good.  Of course.  See, that'll keep everyone happy.  Oh, my God.  Pasties, they're yarmulkes. 
[03:20:30]  Holy shit.  No nipples, but...  Shriner's caps.  Definitely.  Shriner's caps.  Looks like her tits just graduated from Sloan Kettering.  Yeah, don't spin them around so much.  They don't spin like the old days.  Hey, you want to bust in the mouth? 
[03:21:00]  Oh, fuck.  You know, if you look just at the boobs, ignore the hideous face.  Don't even start saying...  Don't even try.  For someone in what?  You know what?  I gotta go with Buffy.  Thank you.  That's pretty amazing for someone in their 70s.  Just the tits.  The rest of the body, yeah.  You're 76, right?  You look good.  All right, here's your music, so you can sing your dumb song.  Here you go.  You're gonna sing it.  Parts on me, Dolly.  Ready?  Better get to you, Dolly.  World War I.  All right, shut up.  Shut up.  Right here.  This is World War I. 
[03:21:30]  Shut up.  Here we go.  Ready?  Get ready to sing.  Here we go.  Focus.  Give me a second.  Dolly Parton, wherever you are, bitch.  Feel free to sing along.  Take your big dick out and join me, hon.  We're gonna have some fun when your twat strikes one.  We're gonna rock around Dolly's twat.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight. 
[03:22:00]  We're gonna rock around Dolly's part and stwat tonight.  This is great.  When the clock strikes two, three, and four, she'll suck your dick, you yell for more.  We're gonna rock around Dolly's twat.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're gonna rock around Dolly Parton's fucking twat.  You can't throw newspapers at her.  Finish your song.  No, I'm gonna finish.  At least I'm in two sections. 
[03:22:30]  That's the instrumental part.  Here we go.  Rolling up and hit her with it for shitting on the rug.  When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven, two, she'll suck your dick and then she'll screw.  Rock around Dolly's twat.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're gonna rock around Dolly Parton's fucking twat tonight.  She's really, like, selling it.  When eight, nine, ten, eleven, two, she'll suck your dick and then she'll screw.  Rock. 
[03:23:00]  We're gonna rock around Dolly Parton's twat.  Dump the garbage on top of her.  Oh, my God.  Everybody's saying that.  Dump the garbage pill all over her.  And the garbage is friends are laughing at me.  I can't hear the music.  Oh, right.  The music.  Oh, shit.  What other garbage is saying?  He had Sandy thrown under her.  Hang on.  There's another verse.  One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, twat.  It's five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock, twat.  Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, twat. 
[03:23:30]  We're gonna rock around you, twat.  We're gonna rock around Dolly Parton's fucking twat tonight.  It's the biggest merchandise available in the lobby.  Twat.  Twat.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Undeterred through all of it.  Yeah, she kept going.  She's a trooper.  Clean it a mess.  Dolly Parton's fucking twat.  No, fuck.  Hey.  That is something.  Sandy, when was the last time you used a stripper pole? 
[03:24:00]  Ooh, we got one.  I know.  Yeah.  Do you want to do a little dance for us?  You have the music?  Yeah.  Can we play some music?  What kind of music do you like?  Well, I have the other Dolly Parton's song, Here You Come Again.  No, we need a real stripper song.  Yeah, we need like a stripper song.  What was your song during the day?  Was it Benny Goodman?  I love Dick.  I should have put I love Dick with me.  I love Dick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on his dick.  Anything by Scott Joplin.  Just made a wet.  Benny Goodman. 
[03:24:30]  It's just like the piano player that used to play during the silent movies.  Oh.  Here we go.  Yeah, here's your song from the old days.  Flash.  Get on the pole, you haw.  We bring you now to a strip club with Sandy K.  Before we send the guys off to war.  This is our celebration of the invasion in Normandy to free France from the Nazi menace. 
[03:25:00]  And now we take a break with Sandy Kane.  Her vagina caused more damage than the Bombay of the Enola Gay.  This is what you're fighting for, boys.  Remember.  We don't want Tojo getting his hands on this.  This is what we're fighting for.  It kind of makes you want to go back to Iwo Jima. 
[03:25:30]  What the fuck?  A pussy will remind you of the rice and raw fish we'll have to eat if the Japs win.  You thought being a POW was bad.  Hamagander at those.  Damn.  She's rubbing her ass on the pole.  Don't rub your ass on the pole.  She's pulling off her hemorrhoid.  She's scratching a hemorrhoid.  That's what it is.  It's a little hemorrhoid scratch.  It's refreshing.  She's scratching like a chihuahua on the carpet.  Her cunt looks like it's wearing the hat that got thrown into the Apocalypse Now helicopter. 
[03:26:00]  Wow, she's doing a little kick with her legs.  She's wearing big white go-go boots.  Yeah.  And genuine fishnet stockings with...  It smells like the fish is still in them.  Can we get a mic on Sandy K?  Oh, you're putting a dollar under your breast?  That's good.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  She can put a safe under that.  What move is that? 
[03:26:30]  Was that ever popular?  That's the I don't want to break my hip move.  It's called my hips are like graham crackers.  Christopher Reeve wouldn't be jealous of that.  Oh, shit.  She's holding the pole and she was just like waiting on the right foot.  I said dance on the pole, not dance like you have polio. 
[03:27:00]  Dude, who does she look like?  It's driving me nuts from an old movie.  E.T.  She looks like Dee Snider.  The old Alec Baldwin movie.  It does.  With the ghost.  The ghost.  Oh, the one that...  Where she was like the secretary at the...  Help me out, somebody.  I don't know the movie.  Yeah.  Beetlejuice.  Beetlejuice.  The receptionist woman.  Receptionist.  Thank you.  Got smoked out of her slit throat. 
[03:27:30]  Yes.  Mic's not on.  All right, hold on.  We're trying to get the mic on.  She doesn't hear us.  She does this shit.  Is this what you used to do in Times Square?  We can't hear her.  We can't hear her.  Yeah, that's what the dance you used to do in Times Square?  I used to get tips, though.  You get tips.  You don't come back.  Hopefully of bayonets.  Oh, we can't hear you.  I had to do this for free?  She wants to be paid. 
[03:28:00]  You want us to do it for dancing on the pole?  Come on from us.  I've got ten bucks if you put some clothes on.  Hey, if you do the big finale by throwing your arms out and then just crashing through  both of those windows, I'll throw a fiver at your fucking cadaver.  New York.  Just plummets to her death.  All right, get her back on, Mike.  That would be a scream.  Screw the stripper pole.  Who gives a shit?  Jesus Christ.  That is just something to look at. 
[03:28:30]  Caratop, where are you going to be, bro?  Wait for it in Vegas.  We're going to be hooking up later and doing some pole.  Hey, Caratop, you're going to be recovering.  I brought my matches if you want me to light my tits up for you.  Yeah, you want to do that?  Yeah.  What are you promoting today?  Nothing.  Just a Luxor?  Yeah, back to Luxor.  Vegas.  You do it six times a week.  Yeah.  Wow.  I forgot where my matches are.  I did have them.  Six nights.  Do you have any matches?  Have you ever seen anything like this in the lounges out there?  No, not yet. 
[03:29:00]  Not really.  Not even at Circus Circus?  Okay, this is I want to do this.  This is her character.  I'm a big fan of yours.  I have watched you on TV, and you're nicer in person.  And Opie and Auntie, the greatest.  Oh, well.  Abuses.  And Jim.  And Jim Norton.  Okay.  This is to everybody here.  There's no blood left in her nose.  There's no pigment left in her nose.  Yeah, big kitty, carrots out, but I don't have any nipples.  God left me out.  But then again, he gave me to Otto.  Why are they so awfully nipples? 
[03:29:30]  He took her nipples away and gave her to Otto.  I need a good man.  They've been chewed off.  Phil Spector shot them off.  He was using them as a target practice.  She's got innies that she can stay.  Oh, God.  That is disgusting.  You can only imagine the cheese that is built up in there.  Oh, God.  You could squeeze her tit like space food.  It'll just come out.  Toothpaste tube.  I'll tell you, men don't know how to make love to titties, guys. 
[03:30:00]  I mean, really, they go right down to the pussy.  They like big titties, but they don't really know how to excite tits.  I'm having trouble.  Maybe anyone goes right to your pussy.  You have a hell of a memory.  Don't light your friggin' wig on fire.  Anybody having a birthday out here.  She looks like they got Lily erased.  Yeah.  The old burlesque music playing.  There she goes.  She's lighting her magic. 
[03:30:30]  There it is.  I want to see her without the wig.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  There she goes.  Guys, can you do this doused in gasoline?  You're going to set your wig on fire.  Yeah, you're going to set your hair on fire.  Put her out.  Put her out.  There you go.  Hopefully, it's a Michael electrocuter.  Oh, I like it.  I love abuse.  You almost set your hair on fire.  I know.  We've seen it out the wig.  Is that flame retardant? 
[03:31:00]  It's worth it.  It's one of the biggest train wrecks I've seen coming into this show.  It's worth it, guys.  We've seen it out the wig.  Don't be an Anthony.  Without the wig, I want to see you.  Where are you performing?  Oh, come on.  Let me see you out the wig.  You saw it.  I'm doing this movie.  No plug until I see you out the wig.  Yeah, you sold us your rectal abscess.  You can.  I don't care.  Isn't this.  What was the look?  Let me see my hair.  I have it.  Let me see it.  Anthony, you know who she reminds me of?  The old cartoon where the dog pulls off the wig.  Dino was in love with.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, when Dino was in love with that dog that did the commercial. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  It was like a lassie.  And then Dino saw the dog without the makeup.  Yeah.  Went like.  She looks like Buffalo Bill when he was dancing.  Yeah.  Would you?  Hey, I'm going to be at Eastern Cock.  Eastern Cock is a gay club downtown.  Oh, yeah?  Eastern Cock, that's going to be October 3rd.  How appropriate.  I can't imagine any man wanting to fuck a woman ever seeing you.  That's going to reinforce all of their ideology.  Maybe even if there's a few that are on the fence, they'll fall right on a cock. 
[03:32:00]  If she could sell tickets, you'd have her at your club.  Are you open in October?  The Yankees are in the playoffs.  Eastern Cock.  Every cock is on a fucking plane to L.A. right now.  Hey, really fast.  We did find her stripper music.  Very good news.  Okay, great.  This is what Sandy Cain used to dance to in what?  In 1912.  That was the first one.  Here's her stripper music.  Okay.  There it is. 
[03:32:30]  This is nice.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're sorry we couldn't get Mary Pickford.  But here is Sandy Cain.  But here is Mary Pickford.  Instead, you got Mary Pickaxe.  A benefit for all those lost on the Titanic last week.  That's beautiful.  Very good.  Is this what you would dance to?  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  I can dance to anything, man.  Anything.  Remember the Lusitania.  Did you work in one of those clubs where the little door would go up and there was a glass?  Peep shows.  Peep shows?  Yes.  Yeah?  It was great.  I watched all men masturbate for like a long time.  And it was great because I really learned a lot about men.  Yeah?  That men will do it to anything, man.  Sheet.  If they could do it to me, right?  And I worked there a long time.  I bet you've seen more cocks wilt.  I so glad. 
[03:33:30]  Looked like time lapse of flowers.  And then, you know, there's this guy who gave me a lot of money to shit on my face.  Who is that, God?  And why haven't you cleaned off your face yet? 
[03:34:00]  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  It paid the rent, you know?  I mean, really.  The job sunk, but you have to do something in life, right?  Not everyone's as lucky as Carrot Top.  Yeah.  He feels lucky right now.  Yeah.  Hey, Carrot Top, are you going to be on the next Surreal Life?  No.  Oh, all right.  I'm getting the wrong info, though.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't think so. 
[03:34:30]  Okay.  Oh, shit.  That's pisser.  Anything else, Sandy?  Sandy, yeah.  No, and I'm also, you know, I still have my public access show called Sandy Kane's Midnight  Blue.  It's on every Friday night at 12 midnight on Channel 57 and 84 RCN.  And anyway, and I will be taping a live show at Eastern Cox.  Can I shit on your face right now?  That'd be great.  I see Carrot Top shit on Sandy Kane's face.  That'd make YouTube. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, we'll cross promote both their shows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I dare you.  I dare you.  I dare you.  You like that stuff?  I love it, man.  Now, real quick, I want to talk about Phil Spector a little bit.  Okay.  Do you think he killed that actress?  He totally did.  She did not stick a gun into it.  Of course, man.  That's why I came out and said it, because he put a gun to my fucking head, and I said,  anything you want, Phil.  I think she should have done whatever he wanted her to do, and she didn't, and he murdered 
[03:35:30]  her.  So that's what you think?  I know.  Because he made you suck his cock with a gun to your head.  Right.  As he sanded off your nipples.  Phil Spector made you suck his cock with a gun to your head?  Yeah.  In a limo or something.  Who had the gun to his?  I actually dripped in my pants to get that one out.  He came running out of the bathroom with that one.  No, the thing is, in those days, I was the only one with tits. 
[03:36:00]  Years ago, they didn't have implants.  So, you know, you say, I had still-  Would you grow up in a Filipinos boy youth home?  I'm just saying that, no, years ago-  She still has the burnt matches sticking out of her chair.  I know.  It's just awful.  Oh, my God.  No, but I'm just saying, I was pretty hot when I was 22 years old, and I had big titties  when nobody did.  Were your nipples like that, though?  Always.  Honest to God, I might even make fun of you.  I need someone to-  Why don't you suck one out?  Oh, my God.  Your nipples look like assholes. 
[03:36:30]  They look like two assholes.  Bleached assholes.  There are nipples inside if someone would suck them out, but no one wants to.  God really didn't want to finish making you.  No.  I have not met-  No one wants to.  Hey, don't touch my nipple.  Even an infant would pass that out.  It was unbelievable.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't find my nipples.  Suck on my nipple.  All right, hold on.  We got-  She's talking about Mitch Hedberg.  Yeah, we got Casper checking in.  Casper, what's up?  Five dates with Bill Spector, and she's still alive. 
[03:37:00]  Very good.  Still alive, man.  Yeah.  All right.  He definitely killed her.  Do you think he's going to be convicted?  Hung jury is what they say.  He's still-  He's really well hung, huh?  Excuse my mind.  Yeah.  Anything else there, Sandy Cade?  Yeah, but aren't they going further with the trial?  Yeah, they're figuring that out, what they're going to do.  Yeah, but I think-  They got to do a redo.  The judge is leaning towards convicting him, though, right?  Don't you think?  The judge? 
[03:37:30]  The judge?  I think it's a jury system.  Yeah, as long as they can go to court in England.  What does Her Majesty's Court say?  No, but he's leaning-  Because he really did murder the woman, she's not going to kill herself, right?  I don't know.  You should.  Yeah.  Why couldn't-  Let's give Phil a second chance.  I don't know, Sarah, she's literally standing knee-deep in trash and topless.  I know.  Screamers hanging off.  I think the problem with the trial was-  She's disgusting like it's court TV. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, to be honest about-  I'm waiting for a house to hit her and those shoes to curl up underneath.  Phil Spector was fucked up that night.  Oh, yeah.  He was on pills.  He was on everything.  He was incoherent.  He was crazy.  He was a credible witness.  Did she bring her into the courthouse just like that?  Maybe she could give the testimony while she lights her nipples on fire.  Let me tell you something about Phil. 
[03:38:30]  Richard Pryor the same exact way.  He was totally incoherent, unfucked up on every shit there was.  There's no way Pryor fucked you.  Why not?  He was crazy about me.  No, he wasn't.  He never heard of you.  What do you mean he never heard of me?  How do you know?  Because I just know.  We read his autobiography.  There's nothing in there about you.  Exactly.  Yeah, well, you know, he definitely did and he was just very crazy about me.  But he was totally fucked up at all times.  And that night he didn't have cocaine.  So I was about to leave and then he said, 
[03:39:00]  Hey, leave the pussy, bitch.  If he knew you, chapter six of his autobiography would be,  The bitch had no nipples.  He went right down to the pussy.  He was not interested in titties.  He probably thought you fucked that thing on your pussy.  It was an umbrella.  He wanted to sit under it.  He was a really crazy guy.  But I would have fucked him if he had cocaine.  He did not have cocaine.  Wait, he always had cocaine.  Not that night.  You have to have standards and thank God you have standards.  Yeah, right.  He probably had it and didn't want to fuck you. 
[03:39:30]  He probably had it.  Yeah, exactly.  He definitely did.  You know, when you're 22, baby, you know, even you look good then.  You didn't know prior when you were 22?  I want to see pictures of her when she was in her 20s.  Yeah, but she didn't know prior then.  Are there any pictures of you?  Do you have a website or something?  No, but...  Or just webs in your pussy?  No, I have pictures when I was four.  In a covered wagon?  Is it true you were in front of a fire when he set himself on fire?  Four.  Yeah, that's the reason. 
[03:40:00]  No, I really...  Really, really?  How old are you?  Can you keep a secret?  So can I.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we heard that one before.  Well, that's mine.  Take your wig off.  Why would you, when they gave away the punchline, just do another one that's the same?  Yeah.  What kind of comedy instincts are those?  You know what?  I think Jim's asking you...  That's what annoys Jimmy.  Jim's asking a good question.  That's what annoys him.  That's a good question.  Like you just said, can you keep a secret?  Yeah.  And the punchline is, well, so can I.  And then they said, well, so can I.  And instead of just realizing the joke was blown, you went, well, that's mine. 
[03:40:30]  Like we were not going to recognize it was the same thing.  And go, ha ha, you card.  No, the thing is, well, that's mine.  That's a punchline.  That's yours.  But the punchline is, well, that's mine.  You're not listening to Jim.  He's asking a great question.  You have no listening skills.  Okay, you're right.  You're right.  When you're right, you're right.  No, it's good.  What is she doing?  That's an impression.  When you're right, you're wrong.  You're doing impressions?  Yeah, I could do...  Swear it's the real person.  All right, we're finally all calming down. 
[03:41:00]  No, I could do...  Joan Rivers, can we talk?  Can we talk?  Can you do it with Edgar?  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  This is...  I could do...  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I love you, Mr....  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Wow, that's good.  Oh, that's dead on.  Dead on.  Wow.  Dead on.  That's pretty good.  Do some more, Fran Drescher.  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Just does one line. 
[03:41:30]  How about one more impression of her?  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Oh, my gosh.  It sounds...  Wow.  Do the episode where they got lost in the cabin.  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  You're a one-trick pig.  Oh, shit.  One-trick horse fucker.  That's it.  Can we talk?  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Yeah, you're right.  We get it.  We get it.  You think I'll get to Vegas?  What? 
[03:42:00]  You get that thing removed.  Yeah, I get it.  Maybe we can't even get to Jersey.  That's when you got it, right?  You said you got that thing?  You're on your way to Coney Island.  I hope she gets to Vegas like Pesci in Casino.  Just beating in her underpants into a fucking hole by Frank Vincent.  Well, next time I'll come on, I'll wear my real hair, okay?  I want to see your hair.  Don't be shy.  You just showed us your hair.  Fuck, man.  God Almighty.  You're not going to show us your hair?  Let's see your hair.  Nah.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on. 
[03:42:30]  Why don't you show a hemorrhoid and a general word not show your hair?  No, come on.  Is it red?  Yeah, it's like this.  Let me see.  I don't.  Don't.  All right.  Jesus.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's see.  Show us.  I'm not taking my fucking wiggle of shit.  Unless you give me $100.  No, I'm not giving you $100.  We're going to plug your gig for you.  With all your money, Jim?  Five bucks.  You get five bucks.  I said before, don't touch the hair.  We'll plug for you.  We'll plug.  Take over my hair.  We'll plug your gig.  Give me the hundred.  I can't pay my rent with your fucking clothes.  I'll suck your nipple out. 
[03:43:00]  I bought your book.  I read your book.  Look, man, you're making fucking money, man.  Exactly.  I'm not saved.  So, you know, show me the way.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Read your book.  Show me the way.  Yeah.  Sounds like Harvey Keitel in Mean Streets.  Hey.  Yeah, no, I'm just saying, man.  Next time I can do the show, I'll show you my real hair, okay?  All right.  You know, remember my hair, it's down to here, down to my hemorrhoid.  Hey, let's go to the Verrazano Bridge and jump off.  Can I be your opening act? 
[03:43:30]  Kitties, the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it doesn't have to be titties.  It could just be asshole.  Caratop, can you follow that?  It may not, actually.  It's a prop act following a prop act.  All right, we're, uh...  Okay, where's Dildo?  Where's Dildo?  Yeah, fine.  Gather up your stuff.  Put your, um...  Yeah, take Dildo.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Here's the music.  Leave your hemorrhoid.  Here's your camera.  Could someone...  Oh, what disease do I have now that I held this?  Probably roaches crawled all over. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, your apartment has a lot of roaches, right?  Oh, totally.  Yeah, running away from her.  Now I have water bugs, so I'm really, I, you know...  Do you really?  Wow.  Of course.  Well, you know, roaches are big water bugs.  Yeah, no.  I mean, water bugs are big.  You have water bugs?  Oh, definitely.  Where are they?  I loved it.  Why don't we, next time I'll...  Not in her twat.  I'll eat one.  We did a Cribs, right?  We did a Sandy Cane Cribs.  Yeah, we did.  We did that.  We went over our house and videotaped our house.  Man, you gotta see this place.  Roaches?  Holy shit.  Yeah, it was really a little run down.  And what about you?  You had a small little room when they did that with you, right? 
[03:44:30]  Yes.  With you.  And now you have a big place right in Hell's Kitchen, right?  Yeah, well, and you still live in that shithole.  That's terrible.  I live in Hell's Kitchen.  You still live in Hell's Kitchen?  I live in a block away from me.  She's still a block away from me.  Yeah.  She's the reason they call it Hell's Kitchen.  You're cooking in Hell's Kitchen.  Hell's bathroom.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy Cane.  Okay.  Yeah, thank you.  We're exhausted.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Until next time.  No problem.  Yeah, gather up your stuff.  Okay.  And thank you very much. 
[03:45:00]  The garbage too?  Well, you can do that for an intern or something.  Okay.  I'm sure they'll be happy to clean it up.  They smell pussy.  They gotta eat clean up the shit.  Yeah.  All right.  I want Sandy to put on a shirt.  I want Sandy to put on a...  Hold on, Sandy, please.  I want Sandy to put on her bra and hat and run through the K-Rock halls.  I want her to run into Chiasano's office.  Is he still here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I put your...  Still here.  ...life back together.  It'll take a little longer.  Well, Carrot Top, I hope you were pleased with your appearance here. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, we have to catch a flight, Sandy.  Yeah, you and Sandy.  So we got Carrot Top, Luxor, and Las Vegas.  Yeah, Luxor starting again.  We got a lot of fans out that way, so...  Yeah.  Yep.  Awesome.  Six times a week.  In fact, we got a lot of friends of mine that listen.  Oh, cool.  I knew I was going to be on.  Hey, is that the casino you've always been playing at out there?  MGM.  MGM for about 10 years, and then this one just started.  Carrot Top.com.  Yes, sir.  All right.  You ready to get that?  Eric, can you put that monitor on that you wrote before, please? 
[03:46:00]  I just want to point something out.  If it's still on, don't touch...  No, it's probably not.  What you wrote?  Okay.  He wrote Carrot Top is here, and he spelled carrot with one R.  Of course.  If it was Cupcake Top...  Can you fucking believe that Bob's big boy hairdo?  Mayonnaise top.  He doesn't know what a carrot is.  Leave me rock alone.  He smelled air.  Yeah, I know.  Leave me rock alone.  He smelled a lot of it.  He smelled a lot of it today.  A real trooper today. 
[03:46:30]  She's well in her 70s, and he smelled her anus.  Oh, God.  She's just gathering her anus in the background.  All right, I apologize.  I'll leave you rock in that fucking ducky boy hairdo.  Ducky boy.  That fucking end of the wanderer's fight scene hairdo.  Okay, Mr. Shop.  Anthony, turn around.  Turn.  Ah!  What about...  Yeah, go around that way.  Take your pictures.  He likes taking pictures.  I do.  Yeah, well, things are going to fall.  Take one of the carrots.  That's a bitch. 
[03:47:00]  All right, Bill Burr's going to be at the Stress Factory all weekend long, starting tonight, Vinny?  Yeah, starting tonight.  Shows are busy.  Reserve it.  Me, you too.  Don't miss Bill.  Yeah, Bill pretty much sells out every time he's at the Stress Factory.  Thanks to this show, by the way.  Really?  Thank you.  Yeah, thank you.  Go over there.  Because I want to take a...  But go over there.  Look at Sandy.  He's dragging the pal talk camera.  Come back.  Come back.  Come back.  She's a fucking disaster.  What happened?  She knocked the pal talk camera over, and then she's dragging the other one. 
[03:47:30]  She's dragging it on her foot.  I think the garbage is just attracted to her.  Following her out of the studio.  Look at the cable for the cloth.  She's dragging it.  That was great.  She's just walking dragging it.  She's walking out of the bathroom at Radio Shack.  You're a mess.  All right, listen.  Why don't we get the fuck out of here?  Carrot Top, it was a pleasure to meet you.  Well, hanging with you for the first time.  Absolutely, man.  We would love to have you back.  We didn't do one of the...  Yeah, when you're back in New York, feel free. 
[03:48:00]  Awesome.  That's fun.  Line of the day.  I think Anthony had about 15 of them.  Yeah.  Fuck.  There's no way we could pick one or two.  So just to acknowledge we do Line of the Day, and it's brought to you by BodogFantasy.net,  offering you all the tools you need to win this season in fantasy football.  Trash talk with confidence and take home the glory.  Go to BodogFantasy.net, okay?  Do that.  Do that, please.  We got to thank Bill Burr.  Yes.  And we got to thank Sandy and, of course, Carrot Top and Vinny.  Of course, Vinny.  And Vinny Brand. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, everyone got their plugs in, so we're just out now.  Let's take it.  And I think Bill Burr is going to come back tomorrow because we don't get to see him anymore  because he's an L.A. boy.  Yeah, Bill.  Absolutely.  So, Bill, you just come back tomorrow.  Yeah, and get into the hole I'm going to buy a hybrid.  I want you to yell at me.  I want to hear about your hybrid car and everything.  We got to do a little catch-up.  We haven't seen it in a while.  As I get into my Escalade and drive home.  People are voting for line of the day on Pal Talk.  They like the God shit on her face thing.  That was great.  They like your time-lapse flower thing.  That was good. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, there were a lot of them.  I like the Dallas Cowboy.  You're opening the Ark of the Covenant.  And whatever you said coming out of the bathroom, Jesus Christ, there were so many.  There were so many.  Listen to the replay later.  I can't wait to hear the replay.  Pick your own.  What a day.  Oh, God.  I turned around.  The ass is awful.  All right.  But you got to admit, for a 93-year-old, she's kind of hot.  I don't know what it should look like, so I can't base it on anything.  If you just look at the...  Well, the boobs have a problem now, too, because there's no nips.  Right after the Triangle of Shirtwaist fire, I think she was at her hottest. 
[03:49:30]  Wow.  Hey, by the way, I'm hearing Sandy Kane has videos on YouTube for the people that want to know more about this mess.  I just enjoyed the sanded-off her nipples.  Yeah, that's a great, funny one.  Oh, shut up.  Just leave.  God damn.  All right.  We treat our guests nice here, don't we?  All right.  We're out here.  All right, Sandy.  Thank you, Sandy.  Oh, God.  Go back to that failing rodeo. 
[03:50:00]  They bring her out when they need the Bulls to leave the arena.  See you tomorrow.  Yeah, that's fine.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Kane.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Ow, ow.  Oh, thanks.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow. 
[03:50:30]  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow.  Ow, ow. 
[03:51:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane, Mr. James Brown. 
[03:51:30]  I don't play it.  I don't play it.  I don't play it.  I don't play it.  I don't play it.  Hey, hey.  Ow.  Oh, hey, hey.  Ow.  Ow.  Hey.  Thanks.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, ow.  I don't know.  I don't play it. 
[03:52:00]  Drink a six pack.  Turn off the lights.  Oh, no.  Smoke some crack.  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
