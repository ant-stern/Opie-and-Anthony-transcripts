<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion of radio pranks, specifically outrageous April Fool's Day stunts, including a recounted prank involving a female radio host's nude walk around her workplace after losing a bet.  This segued into a sexually explicit discussion of dating and sexual encounters, filled with crude anecdotes and listener calls detailing unattractive partners and unpleasant sexual experiences, including descriptions of body odor and one caller’s experience with a deceased former partner.  The hosts frequently used a numerical scale to rate women's attractiveness, often referencing drug and alcohol use.  The topic of "pigging" (sex with less attractive partners) and the compromises involved were also debated.  A clip of people grilling in a shopping cart, using profane language, was played, followed by further off-color anecdotes.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a cell phone video depicting a panicked drug user, followed by a story about the hosts' experience covering a New Orleans Saints game, highlighting perceived differences in the behavior of white and black tailgaters and the Tonight Show's editing of the footage.  They recounted past escapades, such as cooking London broil on tombstones in abandoned graveyards, and the creation of a "Check out the empties, man" t-shirt.  The hosts then reviewed several failed April Fool's Day pranks from various morning shows, including a *Good Morning America* Twitter helmet, a *Fox and Friends* Ted Cruz Winston Churchill tattoo prank, and a *Today Show* prank that fell flat.  A toothpaste-filled Oreos prank was also discussed, with accusations of racism raised.  A caller suggested inviting more experts, leading to a debate about their own expertise versus that of outside experts. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was heavily criticized, with discussions focusing on increased costs, cancelled policies, and difficulty accessing medication, including a personal anecdote from an intern about increased medication costs.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the fallout from their "Whip Him Out Wednesday" (WOW) promotion in Boston.  The hosts discussed their two-week suspension, the program director's memo forbidding any on-air mention of WOW (which they defiantly read on air), and a negative Boston Globe article criticizing the promotion and alleging harassment.  They detailed their conflict with the station's management, expressing anger and frustration at what they perceived as unjust censorship.  They promoted former intern Brian Broski's YouTube channel and recounted the positive listener reaction to WOW after moving to New York.  The controversy's details, including alleged state police involvement, and their defiance against censorship were discussed.  A humorous anecdote about Jim Norton meeting his girlfriend through a radio segment was also shared.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about playing 90s music, listener requests for "WoW" stickers, and speculation about a mysterious woman near the studio.  The conversation turned to bowel movements, the NutriBullet blender, and a detailed, graphic discussion of bulimia, including demonstrations of self-induced vomiting techniques.  Guest Donnie Wicklin brought cupcakes, leading to a humorous exchange.  Anthony's Xbox gamertag and gaming habits were discussed.  A call from a seemingly mentally unstable man from Toronto was interspersed with more casual conversations about Wrestlemania, John Cena, and Hulk Hogan. Another video showing people cooking food on a stolen shopping cart was shown and discussed, along with Who Kid's travels and social media presence.

Finally, the show touched upon professional wrestling, comparing NASCAR and Formula One to wrestling events.  They recounted humorous anecdotes from a Hulk Hogan press conference and an encounter with John Cena, followed by insulting and derogatory comments about wrestling fans, using racial slurs. The segment seemingly concluded with another radio personality, possibly Sam, taking over. References were made to past radio shows and personalities like “Ozone”.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Morning. Hi, everybody. I was just telling the guys, I'm so glad we didn't do an April Fool's prank. Yeah. It's become so hack. Hack city. Hack city, yes. So hack. We went out with a bang. I don't think we've done one since, huh?  No, there's no way. For the first few years, they wouldn't even let us on April Fool's. They gave us the day off. I forgot about that. And then once we were on our first April Fool's, I think we replayed what had happened with the fire. And then after that, it's like, why would we bother after making the old headlines for the big one? 
[00:00:30]  I was talking to some people that are close to my family in my inner circle, explaining like how crazy radio used to be. Yeah. Because this person was not aware of, you know, the history of the radio show. The insanity of it. So I was talking about what we did in Boston back in the day. And I said, there is a time, man, you just went on the air and said, fuck it. We're going to do this today. And no one really got fired. No, no. We didn't really get fired. 
[00:01:00]  It was really hard to get fired as a radio guy. If you had ratings. Especially if you had ratings. You got fired if you sucked. Yeah. They had no problem firing you for that. But if you had any taste of ratings, they never fired you. I mean, man, Cal, I don't like the guy really. But he shut down the Golden Gate Bridge. Yeah. And got a haircut one day and they didn't fire him for that. That would be so fired. Arrested. You would be fired, arrested, thrown in jail. Right. There would be terrorist charges. Right. Or terrorism charges. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah. Right. Lawsuits from people. Oh, it would be crazy. You just never got fired. That's. No. If you got fired, it wasn't because of what you did. It was because they wanted to fire you anyway. Yeah. And that was a good excuse. Right. That's why we were blindsided. Oh, man. After the Sex for Sam thing. Wait, what? Did I fire us? We got huge ratings. We're number one up and down the entire East Coast. They're not firing us. What? We're fired? 
[00:02:00]  No one really does real pranks anymore. They're just over the top douchey. But is it good, clean, fun? Because that's what's important. But who wants good, clean, fun? Oh. It's good. Well, it's not even good. Right. So it's not good. It's clean. Clean. It is clean. And it's not fun. So they should just call it clean. Bed, clean, not fun. Bed, clean, not fun. Yes. Even our own company with their air guitar. 
[00:02:30]  Oh. Looking for it. I called up customer service. I'm like, I want the air guitar channel. It was good natured. And I noticed it was snickering in the background. It came from a good place. It is? I don't know. I just think at that point you just don't do anything. Yeah. Either really try to get creative and do something that gets people talking. Uh-huh. But if you do that, then someone's going to get pissed off and mad and write their stupid letter and then there's problems. And there's a drama. Or you just don't do anything. Uh-huh. 
[00:03:00]  There was one radio station that did something. It just infuriated me. It was brilliant. Oh, it was horrendous. Were you mad because we didn't think of it? Kind of, yeah. There's a radio station somewhere. I don't even know where. I'm not even prepared to talk about this. But someone sent me the link how douchey this one station was with their April Fool's prank. And I guess the female host of the show lost some kind of bet. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, shit. So she had to walk naked around the radio station. Oh, shit. So it was the big setup and you hear a voice like, I can't believe I'm going to do this. And you see cubicles and you don't have the big reveal yet. And I didn't click on this video thinking for a moment that it was actually going to be what it seemed like it was going to be. Was it a basketball shot when you clicked on the link? Oh, wow. I still see those. Oh, my God. That's really sad. 
[00:04:00]  I don't know how many times. You've clicked on it. People always do that. Like, oh, this looks interesting. Oh, motherfucker. That video has no business having well over 100,000 views. No business. That video should have done 10,000 views.  Anyway, so then the big reveal is she appears and she's walking a dog whose name is Naked. But I guarantee the dog's not even named Naked. 
[00:04:30]  She's walking naked around the field.  But she put a sign under the dog that says Naked.  I'm walking naked.  That's a good one. I didn't see that twist coming. That was like Sixth Sense shit right there.  Oh, Naked Lady walking her dog. That's from 2011. It's a newer one. I should have sent you guys the link.  Holy Toledo.  It just infuriated me, though. And she was just having a good time with it. I can't believe I'm doing this. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, I'm walking naked. I'm walking naked.  Brilliant.  Yeah, if someone has the link, send it so we can play for everybody. It's just a...  It's just a fabulous...  Oh, boy. It's a...  Fascinating.  This is the business we're in.  This is the business we chose.  Yeah.  Well, they thought that would be funny or...  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  So you never saw her naked?  Outrageous.  Well, you saw her naked.  And trust me...  Her dog was naked and you saw naked.  And trust me, you don't want to see her naked in the end, either.  No.  Oh, really?  Nah, she's like a four, maybe.  I'll give you a four.  What the hell?  That's pretty good, right?  Four with booze is a six.  That's true.  So you're almost there.  Don't worry about it.  Throw a little cocaine in.  You're up to a seven.  You're a seven and a half.  You're styling.  That's right.  You might actually show her to your friends.  Unless you want to go pigging. 
[00:06:00]  If you want to go pigging, then, you know, that's good enough.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with a good pigging every once in a while.  Nothing at all.  Got to throw one in there every once in a while to mix it up a bit.  You know what?  If you don't have some bad, you can't appreciate the good.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I've heard over the years.  I love the good pigging every once in a while.  Oh, please.  God, we're just praying no one sees you.  I remember one day at Marist College, Adam Ferraro went there, and he brought back this 
[00:06:30]  fucking girl that was just a disaster.  A monster?  Disaster.  What made her a disaster?  Everything that could be wrong with a girl that you think of, an attractive girl, was the opposite.  I'll go, no boobs.  Yes.  Overweight.  Yeah.  Dashed-up grill.  Dashed-up grill.  Just really...  Boring eyes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Doll's eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Stringy hair.  Yeah.  Annoying.  Annoying.  The whole thing.  Yeah.  The whole package. 
[00:07:00]  And we were all crashed out, like, on the floor of his dorm and shit.  Yeah.  And he was literally like a cartoon, trying to tiptoe her out from around us.  And we were awake, like we were waking up and looking.  Right.  And just started to, like, oh, fuck, all right, take it, he's taking it.  And then when he shut the door and she left, we just started cracking up.  And he's like, all right, fuck you.  We were hammered the night before, so it was okay. 
[00:07:30]  You know, you give your friends the benefit of the doubt.  No.  But you're going to goof on them.  You don't give them the benefit of the doubt.  What's wrong with you?  No, no, I mean, you're going to rag on them.  Right.  You never cast judgment because there but for the grace of God go I.  Sure.  Yeah, but you just hope you don't get caught.  Right.  If he's stupid enough to get caught, that's it.  Then it's his problem.  You've got to be stealthed with that.  Sorry, one of my favorite stories is Patrice getting busted with, there was a girl he used  to fool around with, and he referred to her as the fat bitch from the Wiz.  That was what her name was. 
[00:08:00]  And I never learned what her real name was.  He was like, yeah, I saw the fat bitch from the Wiz, and she worked at the Wiz, and she  was a monster.  And when Will, his roommate, caught him sneaking her out, he said he was so humiliated.  He said Will was so nice about it.  He was standing there with his hands on his hips, and he got caught like tiptoeing her  down the steps.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He wasn't nice about it, because we all know the story.  No, no, but in that moment, when he saw her, he was pleasant when he saw her.  He was like, oh, hello, nice to meet you.  And she's like, oh, you piece of shit.  That's funny. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, it's the worst.  Yeah, Keith caught me once, too.  Keith the cop.  He was over the house one morning, and I was just like, all right, yeah, you could head  out.  I'm not doing anything.  He's like, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I'm like, oh, no.  He knows.  He goes, who's upstairs?  I'm like, nothing, nothing, nothing.  He wouldn't fucking leave.  He won't.  And all of a sudden, I hear some rustling upstairs.  I'm like, oh, no, she's going to come down.  Is she pretty?  No.  How bad?  He used to call her lock washer, because he said it looked like she ate a handful of 
[00:09:00]  lock washers and just started chewing on them.  While her teeth fucked up?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were pretty fucked up.  He's probably listening right now.  No, she's not.  Trust me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because she's dead.  She's dead?  Yeah.  Jesus.  This is years ago.  This is right when I broke up with Melinda.  Like, right after.  This is my rebound.  Oh, wow.  Was she...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Do I know that one?  It might.  Why is she dead?  Drugs, I guess.  Jesus.  Yeah.  A little drug overdose.  Oh, I think I kind of...  Yeah.  Yeah, it happens.  What are you going to do?  It was a...  Well, it was like a...  It wasn't a relationship.  Right.  I was just fucking...  And she didn't, like, die the next day.  It was kind of happened.  Huh?  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  I vaguely remember.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Andrew in Atlanta.  It's an upbreak there.  That's the best ending to a fucking ugly chick story I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, you don't do better than that.  Andrew, what's up?  What's up, dude?  All right.  So you're talking about Pagan, right?  Well, we kind of were.  All right.  Well, my buddy, you know, just, like, got me thinking about it.  He was hanging out with some fat chick, the son chick, and he started, you know, feeling 
[00:10:30]  his fingers in a little slit.  Turned out not to be her vagina.  Turned out to be a little fat slit.  Did you ever run into that, Oak?  A what?  No.  No?  I don't know what he said.  No.  No.  He was playing with a dick, is what you're saying.  You know what I'm talking about? 
[00:11:00]  No, no, but, like, she's, like, the chick's so fat.  I understand what you're trying to say.  A fat slit?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So there's folds of skin down there, and he thought he was diddling her, and he went  into a fat slit, as he called it.  Yeah, but you make it sound like he thought it was a clit.  But it was a small penis or something.  I think he said slit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, boy.  It was a very big, small penis.  Yeah.  I think you'd throw her out for that.  What?  You're talking about a big, sloppy vagina? 
[00:11:30]  The labia had two testicles in it, too.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's just a big, there's just so much, you know, folds, you know, going on there.  Right.  You got to roll her and flower and look for the wet spot, right, guys?  Yeah.  Am I right, guys?  You'll fuck off.  Hand me that shovel.  All right, now I understand, Andrew.  Yeah, but if you're, but if you're, oh, my in-laws are listening.  Oh, boy.  Can't we do these breaks later when they go to work?  Oh, boy. 
[00:12:00]  I can picture their kitchen.  I've been there a million times.  The coffee's brewing, and they're listening to this.  Here's what you say.  There's three simple words.  Right.  It's a show.  No, they're cool, actually.  That's all I say.  It's a show.  And, plus, he's probably thinking about his stories from back in Michigan.  You think he doesn't have any back in high school?  He's calling in.  Exactly.  No, I guess, but.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  No, I'm kind of with you now.  I don't know who's supposed to talk now. 
[00:12:30]  Me, him.  That might be my problem today.  What?  I was talking.  Listen, in your opinion, like, did you ever run into that, though?  You know, he's asking the same dumb question.  I guess the answer is very, okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.  Okay, okay, listen, I get what you're saying now, but when you go pigging, you take some  of those things off the table, if you know what I mean.  Right in.  Yes, you do. 
[00:13:00]  You got a beautiful girl.  Everything's on the table, but.  Beautiful girl.  When that number starts dropping, you take certain things off the table.  Right.  There's no ass licking.  There's no.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's no going down.  You got to take shit off the table.  You might do a little finger popping still, fist popping if they have big giant vaginas.  Yes.  You might not even kiss the girl.  I mean, there's a lot of things that take off that table.  Yeah.  You know, a lot of girls have bad breath.  A lot of girls have bad breath. 
[00:13:30]  Sir, have you ever talked to people before?  Holy shit.  I think it's now him, right?  Shut up.  Okay.  We got you.  Someone else is trying to talk.  You're just babbling.  God damn it.  You really are, sir.  You're yammering.  You're yammering.  I love this guy.  He's the worst.  He's my favorite.  Please call.  Andrew, please call every day.  I want you to be one of my regulars.  Love you.  You're an asshole.  I hate you.  Oh, God.  All right.  What else there, Andrew? 
[00:14:00]  Not for you.  No, no, no.  Like, I don't got no other.  You just were talking about picking, and I had a buddy, you know.  Yeah, we got the story from you, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We heard you.  All right.  We're going to hang up now.  You did very well, though.  All right.  All right.  Good, good, good.  Good, dude.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow, hopefully.  Call tomorrow, please.  Every day.  Love you, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Thank you, dude.  I love you.  I appreciate it.  I don't dislike you.  He loves you.  I was just trying to just go into a thing about Piggins.  Talking about how many braful women are out there, and he just starts yammering. 
[00:14:30]  Talking about women's breath, and he fucking going off.  How do they not know?  There was, uh, Jimmy Knows, Jimmy Knows, this one, uh, one girl, became part of his act  for a little while, but I was, uh, dating for a very short time, literally a supermodel.  Oh.  Not a supermodel like you would know.  So, but someone that was gorgeous.  Yeah.  And, uh, you would know her, too, by the way.  Oh.  And, uh.  Wow.  Problem was, her breath was horrendous.  Really? 
[00:15:00]  And I couldn't get, and I really liked her.  Couldn't get past it?  I couldn't get past it.  Jimmy Knows, too.  It's a word.  I don't know exactly what I mean.  It became a bit in, uh, Jimmy's act, because we, I, I used to talk about it with Jimmy,  and, uh.  She would try to kill it with gum, right?  No good?  She would just chew gum constantly.  Her breath smelled as bad as a dumpster.  What was it?  I don't know.  I think it was tummy problems?  I don't know what it was.  That's gums, man.  I think that's, that's a weird thing.  When people are chewing, especially when they chew that wintergreen, here's the word, 
[00:15:30]  wintergreen makes really bad breath worse.  Right.  Really?  It gives it like a, a, a carrier.  It gives it a place to latch onto and get out.  Sickly, sweet smell.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  She was, she was beautiful.  Yeah.  She did a lot of modeling.  A lot of modeling.  Oh.  And, uh.  Wow.  We might have, uh, met her through the radio show back in the day.  Oh.  And she, uh, she, but her breath was so freaking bad.  That's heartbreaking, isn't it?  Heartbreaking.  And I thought, I mean, we all have bad breath from time to time.  So you figure, all right, she's having a bad day. 
[00:16:00]  Bad day.  All right.  She's having a bad week.  Sure.  When it gets to all right, she's having a bad month.  Consistent.  Yeah.  And you can't say anything.  Wow.  Did she have problems with her teeth?  Did you notice any?  No.  Nothing.  No?  That's the weird part.  No tongue film?  Nothing like that?  I never was able to figure out what the, what the problem was.  What happened?  What did you do?  Maybe she was puking a lot.  I was just going to ask you if she had any idiots.  A model, a fucking bulimic.  Oh, it makes sense.  But she didn't, she didn't, she didn't look like she was a puker, but maybe that's what 
[00:16:30]  it was.  She didn't look that skinny to me, right?  Yeah, no, she was all right.  And maybe it was the bile coming up or something.  Then some of that gets stuck in between the teeth.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, there are some fucking randons.  A little bile.  But I can back up what Jimmy's saying.  That's just a, that's a game changer.  It's like, how do you not know?  Like, if you're going to fuck somebody, or if just to hook up once, how do you not at least  be aware of that?  You know, we all have it sometimes, but I mean, putrid, no gum, it makes me angry. 
[00:17:00]  A good flossing will take care of that, too.  Yeah, sometimes it will.  It will help.  A couple days of flossing, you could take care of your, your flossing.  I hope people around here are listening to that.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Not if it's dry, though.  Sometimes it's a dry.  What is that about?  Dry.  Dry.  It may mean they eat too much sugar.  Some people eat sugar.  It's like, I won't eat a lot of sugar.  It dries my mouth out, so I know I like to eat it.  Certain foods will dry people's mouths out, and they eat it anyway. 
[00:17:30]  Yikes.  Terrible.  Let's go to, oh, Texas is always good for a call.  Matt in Texas.  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Yeah, if you, when you were talking about hogging and how, like, certain things are off  the table, totally disagree, man, including the ugly chicks, too.  You got to go all out, so when you do get that hot piece of ass, it's like, holy shit.  I'm not burying my face.  No, you take things off the table.  Everyone knows that.  No, you're gone.  No, man. 
[00:18:00]  You got to go for the whole disgusting, obviously, of the whole situation.  Yeah, man.  If you're not in a toilet bowl, cuking your fucking face up, and calling up an ex-girlfriend,  and like, hey, you know, we need to get back together.  You're an animal.  You're absolutely an animal.  There's no way.  You accept that you're pinging, but then in your mind, you quickly go through the checklist  of the things you're not going to do.  She's getting the basic model, not the loaded model with all the features.  Well, I mean, you got to do, like, pre-checks. 
[00:18:30]  You know, you got to just split the fingers and, you know, smell the finger real quick,  and, like, that shit smells like last week's cheese.  Oh, come on now.  Even if it smells like this week's cheese, it's not good for a vagina.  Come on, Jimmy.  Even fresh cheese is not good for a vagina.  I don't do well with smells.  No, no, no.  I've been with women over the years where the smell is what – and it's not a bad smell.  The smell's not right, and it just drives me nuts.  Like, it's a complete turn-off for me. 
[00:19:00]  But can a good smell – like, I like weird stuff.  Like, I like the smell of feet or underarms.  Only on the right girl, though.  If the chemistry is right, that smell drives me crazy.  Well, yeah, that's nature.  But if it's bad, I can't be around them.  And it's not like they have B.O. or anything.  It's their smell is not right for you.  Their natural scent can't be sexy or terrible.  Jeez, so animalistic.  You don't like that at all, though?  No, you know, I do.  But as long as it's not, like, a dirty –  Right.  It's going to be dirty.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  All right, let's go to Bob in Louisiana. 
[00:19:30]  Bob has a good story.  I hope this is true.  We hate fake radio stories, by the way.  Oh, Bob.  Don't fool around with that shit with us, please.  What's up, Bob?  Oh, no, no.  This was back in the 90s.  I just broke up with my girlfriend.  So some friends thought, hey, you know, we'll hook you up with this girl we know.  So I was driving, and it was a 94 Saturn.  And it was six shift.  I pull up.  As soon as she walked around the corner, I just – I was like, oh, shit.  She probably topped out at a good 550, 600 pounds. 
[00:20:00]  She got into the car.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So you still said, fuck it, even though you saw that she was 550 to 600 pounds?  I mean, she was there.  I mean, what the fuck?  I'm going to just, you know, peel out and break off.  It's true.  It's a dreamweaver moment.  Yeah, 600 pounds, you peel out.  Someone's with 200 pounds, you deal with it.  600 pounds, you drive away.  What's she going to do, Chase?  You're a drive-by – hold on.  You're a drive-by rookie, by the way.  Yeah.  You always say a different car just in case they're 550 pounds, and then you fly by, and 
[00:20:30]  then you write them back or whatever and say something like, oh, man, you know, something  came up.  Sorry.  We'll try to redo this.  Right.  And if they are all right, you pull up with a car that's not the one, you'd go, oh,  my – you know, I decided to, you know, take this car.  You could even let her in on it because that would be kind of a compliment.  It's like I was going to, you know, just to make sure I bought a different car because,  you know, I wasn't sure. 
[00:21:00]  But, man, oh, you're just the bestest.  You've got to be good with the drive-by.  Yeah.  There's all sorts of rules.  But anyway, so you said –  The problem was that she lived right across – I lived in one apartment complex.  She lived right across the street in another apartment complex.  Oh, Cloverfield standing there in a sundress.  Just keep driving.  How'd you meet her?  Online or something?  No, no, no.  There was some friends who hooked me up as a blind date. 
[00:21:30]  Why did they do that, right?  A bunch of pricks.  Those aren't friends, man.  Yeah, no shit.  But – so anyway, she gets in, and I start taking off down the road.  First gear, second gear, no problem.  Third gear, the car just bogs the fuck down.  I couldn't get the fucker out of third gear.  I was like, what the fuck's going on?  So I sat there.  I was like, you know what?  Fuck this.  I told her, I guess I'm having some car problems.  We circled the block.  I dropped her back off, went back to my house. 
[00:22:00]  I was like, oh, fuck this.  I'm never calling her.  I avoided going past that apartment complex as much as possible.  I'll bet you that she's so used to that, she probably didn't even unplug the iron,  because she knew she'd be back in five minutes.  Left the stove on, water running in the tub.  I'll bet you she threw a three-minute egg in, knowing she'll eat it when she got home.  It's an ostrich egg.  She's a very hungry gal.  A few people saying the hot girl with the bad breath. 
[00:22:30]  That's all bulimia.  It might be.  A couple people are saying that.  We don't have to go to those calls.  Let's say hi to TJ in Colorado.  TJ.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  Just a kid.  Second girl I ever had sex with.  So I'm just happy to be in there.  And we start going.  About halfway through, I start smelling this rancid smell.  Never smelled this stuff before.  In the middle of having sex with this woman, the young girl herself, I say, 
[00:23:00]  Can you smell that?  What is that smell?  Oh, no, you dummy.  I didn't have no fucking clue.  She's like, Just be quiet.  Just be quiet.  The whole time, I'm asking, Do you smell that?  Do you smell that?  Finally, it's finished.  She's getting up.  She got dressed so fast.  I was like, I thought it was me.  You insulted her, sir.  I think it's.  Was it a vagina?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that smelled like brutal, man.  I went to sports and came over right after practice, evidently, and didn't have time to  clean up, per se. 
[00:23:30]  But that's a turn-off for Jimmy.  No, you know, it's funny.  I used to like sweaty girls, I remember.  Sweaty girls I could handle, but there was one I had, let's just say within the last few  years, and it was one of those, it was a really weird, like almost a milky.  Oh, boy.  You know that smell that someone's got, it smells like a yeast infection, like that's.  You're making me giggy.  But I mean, that's the type I can't get past, and I'm pretty good with that stuff.  Yeah.  But that's the kind that's like, whoa.  And it was really, and the girl was very hot, too, and it really bothered me. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, man.  It was horrendous.  And I couldn't, having, when you're having sex, you're like, oh, no.  Oh, no, you actually had a, like.  We've all been through it, yeah.  Yes.  It was terrible.  All right, TJ.  Take it easy, fellas.  I will, I will, for the ladies out there, I will say, I'm sure there's instances where  guys have swamp ass, and their fucking, their fucking balls are just rubbing against their  disgusting, putrid assholes.  Yeah, no treat. 
[00:24:30]  Our balls could get brutal.  And that's got, and a trooper will just go right down there and fucking go to town.  Fucking troopers.  That's the worst.  Oh, man.  It's the worst.  How do you not aware of that?  I like a good scrub-a-dub-dub before I, uh, I'm going out with a young lady.  This was internal.  Yeah.  This was one of the, you don't notice it until things are, you're having sex for a while.  Dang, Angie.  Yeah.  And then it's almost like the friction just, like, releases whatever.  It's amazing. 
[00:25:00]  It's like a scratch and sniff with your dick.  Yeah.  Right.  Scratch and gag.  Terrible.  I was pretty much raped by a fat chick while hammered.  No, you weren't.  What are you talking about?  Can't happen.  I don't believe guys could actually get, uh, raped by, uh, women.  Jimmy in New York.  They wanted it.  Uh, it happened.  And go fuck yourself.  It was awful.  What?  What happened?  Uh, I was a bartender and a bunch of us used to hang out after hours. 
[00:25:30]  And, uh, this chick wanted me for a long time.  She was a fucking animal.  And I'm a big guy myself.  And I, you know, I was always nice.  I would never, uh, you know, shudder or anything.  But, uh, she finally got me one night.  That was it, man.  We left the bar.  It was probably like 5.30, 6 in the morning.  And I left with other bartenders.  It was like a clique of people that I used to hang out with.  This fucking guy was laughing the whole time. 
[00:26:00]  He, like, pretty much carried me up the fucking stairs to this girl's apartment.  And he was with another chick.  The only thing that I got away with, he was with a chick that he should have been banging.  She had a boyfriend that we were friends with.  So he couldn't say dick about me banging this girl.  Because I would have blew up his spot.  But anyway, the next day I wake up.  And, uh, I'm fucking there with her.  And I'm like, fucking shit.  And she had to drive me back to work that day.  She pulls me into the, uh, parking lot in the back of the bar.  And the fucking people see me. 
[00:26:30]  The cooks are seeing me.  The Mexicans, they're all laughing.  This is a story you're telling the shed while you're drinking, like, beers and whiskey with your friends.  Right.  This sounds like every Long Island fucking little hangout I've had in the backyard where someone goes,  Hey, let me tell you what happened.  This fucking chick.  It was so bad.  I got fucking crazy.  All righty.  All right.  Fair enough.  All right.  The other guy I saw like Oscar Lapidus and Sonny La Palada.  I'm out. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  Yeah.  So there I was.  No, no, guys.  Let me tell you this.  This chick, she should come to my house, right?  Just, you're like, oh, fuck.  Give me another beer.  Let's go to Zach in Jersey.  Zach.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Just to carry on what Jimmy was saying about that milky smell.  I used to date this girl and, like, bang her.  Everything was fine.  But then she'd fall asleep with her mouth open and she'd snore and then wake up in the middle 
[00:27:30]  of the night and the room had, like, this yogurt kind of.  Holy shit.  I never knew what it was and then it turns out, so years later, I ended up marrying her friend  and they were all together one night and they're talking about how they used to have sleepovers  and they'd have to leave the room because this girl would do the same thing.  She'd wake up.  She'd wake everybody up in the middle of the night.  She'd wreak the room up with her breath.  Wow.  That's fucking industrial.  You know what it was?  She snored, right? 
[00:28:00]  That means her mouth was probably open because she wasn't breathing.  It would probably dry out and get that dry, awful mouth smell.  Dying bacteria.  Your air just pushes out to the room.  Wow.  Yeah.  Good job, Zach.  That's funny.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Why are we doing this to ourselves?  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Hey, boy.  Hey.  I was right out of high school and met this little Puerto Rican chick at work and she was 
[00:28:30]  a couple of years older than me and got with her one night and I was going down on her,  eating her, and I was like, what the hell?  Nice little cottage cheese discharge in my mouth.  Holy shit.  Exactly.  It's safe to say every pants have a tent in them right now in this room.  Enjoy your eggs, boys.  Enjoy your eggs.  Holy mackerel.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I kind of just dry heaved a little bit. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That one got me.  Jay in Connecticut.  Jay.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, buddy.  Grand.  Nothing, by the way.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, yeah, okay, so I meet this girl, right, and, uh, she was kind of a weirdo to begin  with.  She had, uh, she had some mental issues, but she was hot, so I went for it, you know, like  every guy probably would.  Of course.  But anyway, anyways, I ended up with her at night, we ended up in the sack, and, you  know, we're going at it, and I, I'm smelling this really bad smell. 
[00:29:30]  In a sack.  And I'm like, God, man, what the heck is that?  And, uh, you know, at first I didn't say anything, you know, and kept going at it, and  then I just, you know, the smell just started continuing, and I was like, okay, I gotta say  something.  I said, what is that smell?  Well, obviously, she's been smelling it, too, so she gets up, she runs to the bathroom,  and I'm in suspense of what's going on.  She comes out, and she's holding a tampon in her hand, and she goes, I found it. 
[00:30:00]  Come on.  Come on.  I believe her.  I don't.  I don't think she'd run out and yell, I found it.  I don't.  Then his friend fell out of the closet with the camcorder, and he was puking, and the  camcorder, the tape broke, and he doesn't have it, and everyone started puking and shitting.  Right.  Yeah, that's funny.  And then people in the neighbors started puking.  Oh, shut up.  He was great.  He was terrific.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jay.  I believe you.  I believe you, buddy. 
[00:30:30]  I'm going no on that one.  All right.  Celebrity pigging stories coming in.  Another one, my aunt went into labor while my uncle was eating her out.  Oh, shit.  I have to, I fucked a girl with a pussy that smells so bad I had to stick it in her ass.  By the way, eating out is the worst fucking term for going down on a girl.  It's the worst.  So I'm eating a, it's just, it's a horrible, disgusting term for going down on a girl.  It's terrible.  All right.  I got to go with this one. 
[00:31:00]  There's a lot of good ones, but.  Brian in Kansas City.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Brian.  I couldn't resist calling this one in, but this is about 15 years ago.  This guy's just phoning in this call.  Right.  I was at a party with some friends and met this girl, and she's hot, hot girl.  Perfect body, great tits, everything.  Ooh.  Get her back to my apartment, put her on my bed, you know, spread her legs.  She's got a knee skirt on, spread her legs. 
[00:31:30]  I'm kneeling on the bed, or kneeling on the floor next to the bed, and I pull her panties off, white cotton panties,  and there is the biggest, thickest skid mark in her panties.  It looked like a Hershey bar milk.  And the worst part about it is I went down on her anyway.  I've had the point of no return.  You're there.  I passed it up and went down on her anyway.  It's like combat.  Wow.  Once you're there, you've got to, you know, you're there. 
[00:32:00]  You've got to go in.  That's what all the training's for.  God damn it.  You're training kicks in all those years.  You're training kicks in.  She's got a beautiful vagina, but the smell was rancid.  That's great.  She had to be mortified because she had to have known when she got dressed afterwards.  Yeah.  I know.  It was in there.  Anyway, that's my story.  I mean, that's probably the sickest thing I've ever done.  Stick to it.  Luckily, but couldn't resist calling that one.  Good job, Brian.  All right.  You guys, take it easy.  See, in that situation, here's my training, I would think. 
[00:32:30]  In that situation, I would spill something accidentally on the panties on the floor and stuff.  And they go, oh, here's some pajama pants.  Let me throw this in the wash.  That way, the skid marks are gone.  Everyone gets their clothes clean, and nobody's feelings are hurt.  But it's still on her body.  Well, you know, I understand that.  If you can make a skid mark like that.  You just spill a little on her, too.  Hey, maybe you should take a shower. 
[00:33:00]  And then she breaks up with you because you think she had Parkinson's.  I think at that point, you don't eat the whole ice cream cone.  Right.  You just kind of enjoy the cherry for a little while.  It's good.  It's like one of those mixed chocolate vanilla cones.  You just stick to the vanilla side.  That's even better.  Thank you.  Let's stick to the vanilla side.  See, you took my bit and made it a little better.  I hear you.  That's why it's been 20 years of terrificness.  They start the concept, and you hammer it home.  Perfect. 
[00:33:30]  What's that?  An x-ray of a chainsaw embedded in a worker's neck.  How the fuck does that guy even live?  Well, that's crazy.  You could see why.  It didn't hit anything.  Maybe.  It didn't hit his spine.  Damn.  Wow.  He's lucky, though.  Did the guy attack him, or did he fall on it?  I bet he fell on it.  I think he disconnected it from the motor.  But keeping the blade in his neck, doctors say, is what kept him from bleeding to death.  Wow.  He's doing fine after surgery and is expected to make a complete recovery.  Wow.  30 stitches, an hour of surgery.  It was a quarter inch from his carotid artery. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  That's a big bitch.  Amazing.  I have good.  Only 30 stitches?  30 stitches.  You had a chainsaw in your neck.  Why would they move her back into the chest?  Yeah.  Thank the Lord.  He has a phenomenal tough guy story.  Morning show banter with their little coffee cups in front of them.  You all need their little coffee cups.  I had a chainsaw in my neck.  Good stuff.  Yep.  The only person I know who's had something tougher than that happen to them is probably our meteorologist. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, wow.  Good time.  Hot one.  Pussy.  Like every other show, the hot weather girl.  No.  I can't even imagine something like that happening in your life.  Unbelievable.  Okay.  Storm's going to be moving into the...  I do want to quickly change stuff.  Because what I do want to point out is we are going to be slowly ramp...  Wait until you hear what the morning shows did for April Fool's.  I want to hear that.  We'll do it after a break because we've got food here.  Oh, we sure do.  I want to make sure you didn't miss any good stories. 
[00:35:00]  We've pretty much done these even though there's some more good ones.  Yeah.  How happened, Trav?  That's fine.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  You might as well.  Go, man.  Go.  Just let her rip, Trav.  Go, man.  Go.  It's your show, Travis.  You know what?  We're really mad at you.  We're really mad.  Oh, my God.  Call it all.  Freaks.  We're mad.  You're mad?  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Why would you be mad, Tim?  Poor Travi.  He's incompetent.  Is he ready to go now?  Yeah, I'm ready to go now.  Oh, cool.  I'm ready to go now.  All right.  Can I take one more call?  Sure.  Oh, wow.  Can I try again?  No, no.  No, I'm sorry.  Why would we?  Brian in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  Hello.  Brian, come on.  I see what you want to say.  This is the truth.  I was like 15.  Okay.  My very first time, we were at a party, got with this girl. 
[00:36:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I wouldn't have taken that bite, Ant.  I know.  I wouldn't have taken that bite.  All right.  Go ahead.  Oh, God.  Go ahead, Brian.  Sorry.  All right.  Now, that's all right, boys.  But I got out with this girl.  It was my very first time.  I'm, you know, we're in the bedroom at this, you know, house, whatever.  Right.  And, you know, I'm spanking.  I'm sucking on her nipples.  Right?  Yeah.  And I get this taste in my mouth.  And what it was is where the bra was must have created a big zit and it popped right in my mouth. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Where the bra was rubbing.  She had a big zit.  It's even worse to hear it.  I was eating all the fucking juice out of it.  We understand, sir.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have to.  I believe you.  I believe you.  I don't want to believe you.  It's going to happen to my friend.  All right, boys.  You know what?  I wish it didn't happen to me, but.  Yeah, of course.  That was my first experience, boys.  Well, you know what, sir? 
[00:37:00]  After all these years, I mean, you just have to.  Get over it.  Yeah, well.  Get over it.  Woo.  Well.  All this running and crying.  And sucking a zit.  Oh, no.  I don't know, freaks.  The L.P. and Anthony Show.  We'll be right back.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:37:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. gasm.  That's another one we always have on.  There's always Guns N' Roses news.  That's not.  I rarely play Guns N' Roses.  Oh, no.  Why?  I've heard of it before.  Doug McKagan is reuniting with Guns N' Roses for five shows in South America.  My God.  Is that Guns N' Roses with Axl?  Yeah.  Yes.  So we're getting closer to a full-on reunion.  Is Slash going to be there?  Yeah, it's not going to be there.  Not yet.  Yeah, but they'll get to that point.  Oh, yeah?  Maybe. 
[00:38:00]  Is it reasonable?  I don't even say maybe.  It'll happen.  There's too much money involved.  Once they didn't go into the hall together, I'm like, wow, that's real.  Usually bands can put it down for one day to do the hall, and maybe they can do that.  Now, he's always pretty friendly with us.  Dancing with Mr. Brownstone.  Ain't been knocking.  This is about heroin.  He won't leave me alone.  This could be such an asshole. 
[00:38:30]  He's just an asshole.  He's one of the best front men ever.  Man, were they fucking huge.  I know we've done this break a million times, but I have no problem.  I have no problem with it.  Appetite for destruction from beginning to end.  It's just one big sing-along.  There was one job site I was on during the 90s and stuff, around that time, the early 90s,  that didn't have a fucking big boombox with Guns N' Roses blasting every day. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah, well, you know, that's what you do at the job site.  That's why things don't get done.  Turn that off.  Turn that off.  Kids don't understand.  You're at lunch break.  You want to listen to some Sinatra?  That's between you and, you know, the boss.  Yeah, you put the standards on.  The standards.  Oh, God.  Nice.  By the way, it's podcast day.  The Opie and Anthony podcast.  Every Wednesday, a new episode.  A lot of people are using that instead of, well, maybe I shouldn't say. 
[00:39:30]  They're kind of frustrated with the service, so they're just relying on the podcast.  Probably shouldn't say that.  What's this week's podcast, Sam Roberts?  Well, it's very taxi-themed.  Yeah?  Yes.  Taxi-themed.  I would think.  Let's cab stories.  I would think Amy Schumer.  No.  We didn't go with an Amy Schumer story on the cabbie that dilled her?  Why wouldn't we?  We didn't.  We filled up.  I mean, it was just a quick two bits. 
[00:40:00]  That's some drunk blonde in your cabbie.  Yeah, but I think you've got to put the Amy Schumer story on there.  The show just started.  Yeah.  We will.  Yeah, but this is a good, this is timely.  She's going to be a big star and her show just started.  She's all over the media right now.  Dancing lessons, diddling lessons.  And you squeeze her story in there as well.  I agree.  Uh-oh.  Why, what do you have?  Uh, we put on the, uh, positive cabbie.  Remember that, asshole?  Yeah.  Yes. 
[00:40:30]  Positive cabbie.  You kept sneaking in HIV.  HIV, yes, of course.  Why wouldn't we?  Positive cabbie.  Yeah, I met him.  I met him and I took his cab.  Yeah.  He dragged him in.  He was creepy.  Oh, he was.  Was he the one with the American flag tie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember the show.  Was that on?  Yeah.  That's right.  And then, uh, Anthony and Patrice doing the, uh.  Yeah, the taxi show.  Nigga Nassi.  Nigga Nassi, yeah.  Oh, Nigga Nassi is funny.  Really funny.  That's good.  All right.  Very cool.  Should do very well.  Go get it.  We checking those numbers?  How are they?  Uh, we can do it right now? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, man.  We don't need to.  I should, I think we should tease it for a while.  You just don't give it to the people.  Well, you don't tell them the numbers.  Right.  They don't see it anyway.  They like to hear the numbers.  They like to hear the excitement, though, Sam.  They do, right?  Oh, absolutely.  You don't think so?  No.  Did we tweet the link for the, uh, the podcast so I could retweet the O&A Show Twitter account?  I would hope so.  Oh.  Yes, it's been tweeted.  All right.  Where is that now?  O&A Show on Twitter.  Is that us?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:41:30]  All righty.  I don't see it.  Oh, wait.  Maybe I see it.  Hold on.  Let me do it.  And that account, by the way.  Oh, here we go.  Look at me.  Going to be live tweeting during the big unmask.  Oh.  I'm going to be live tweeting during that.  No, you have to be concentrating on what's going on.  But I like live tweeting events and things.  And where are we at with the cupcakes?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Where are we at with the cupcakes?  That made a piece out of me yesterday.  They did?  Oh, so annoying.  Why?  Because you don't like cupcakes?  Yeah, that's why. 
[00:42:00]  I have no idea what the calls going out to celebrities embarrassing us with such a dumb idea.  That is embarrassing.  I got a text from a celebrity.  Did you?  Yes, sir.  Paul Williams.  What did I say?  Paul Williams?  Rob Bartlett.  Oh, there you go.  From Don Imus' show.  From Don Imus' show.  And a friend of ours.  Somebody from Sirius called me yesterday and asked me if I would come down to Caroline's on the 17th and give you guys a cupcake.  Oh, boy.  Dot, dot, dot.  April.  April.  April Files.  April Files.  April Files.  April Files.  And they did spell it that way, too, yes. 
[00:42:30]  And they wouldn't give Rob Bartlett, if you've ever seen Rob Bartlett, they'd probably hand him six and hope one made it to the stage.  Right.  He's a big boy.  So, all right, I retweeted the link, too.  Go get our podcast.  Every Wednesday.  Don't forget.  Rob's great.  He's going to get a bunch of, like, barbecued ribs, frozen and stuff.  Why?  Just because I was having a party, and he was like, hey, I can't make it but here.  Why didn't he come?  I don't know.  What kind of person is he?  He's busy.  He's invited to all my parties.  He came to one.  He brought a bunch of those Mexican Coca-Colas that are made with sugar instead of the, like, corn syrup, whatever the fuck they use. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  High fructose shit, and it's made with real sugar, and you put that in the Captain Morgan and shit.  Oh, it was great.  It's delicious.  He is a pro at partying.  But it sounded like he did a re-wrap on the ribs.  Sounds like it was something that was sent to him.  A re-gifting?  No, because it was shipped from the actual company.  Oh.  That was like, because it came in the big styrofoam thing with the dry eyes.  That's not nice.  That's needy shit. 
[00:43:30]  Needy?  It's needy.  It was fantastic.  I thank him again.  I'm going to thank him again right now.  Thank you, Rob Barber.  That's going a little too much out of the way.  And you know when we ate him?  It was a bunch of people after a poker game, and it was 7 in the morning, and we had them for breakfast.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  Nice.  With little eggs?  No.  Just the ribs for breakfast.  Throw the little eggs in there.  Eh.  Couldn't be bothered.  Speaking of barbecues.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:44:00]  I know there's a video going around where, you know, people are sending it around because  I'm not stupid, because they hate black people.  And they're like, oh, look at black people being stupid.  But I think it's an amazing idea.  Yeah.  The shopping cart barbecue.  Oh, I saw that.  I think it's an amazing idea.  I went to, I bet you didn't go to the same site I went to to see that.  No, I did not.  Exactly.  Nambla's homepage.  Oh, Jesus.  But they failed trying to recruit me, because I sat there looking at that same video going,  damn, that's pretty smart.  There was a time I had no money. 
[00:44:30]  I would have, I would have loved to do that.  What happened?  What is it?  Look.  They put the wood on the part.  You know where you put, like, your big bag of dog food or your charcoal or something?  Or a case of water.  A case of water.  You put it on the bottom of the cart.  That's where he put the wood.  Right.  And then, hold on, you've got to start over now, because these guys rule.  And then in the actual cart itself, because it's like a grill, on the bottom of the cart,  that's where they put their steaks.  Let's retweet this video, or tweet out this video as well for the people.  That's actually pretty brilliant. 
[00:45:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, you've got to make do.  But they were passing us around, like, look at these, you know.  But why would they, I hope they wash the bottom of that.  All I'm thinking as I'm seeing this is, like, the fire kills all the germs.  Oh, the fire's going to kill all the germs.  I wouldn't wash it.  I don't know.  I probably would have put tinfoil down, though, because I don't know what's melting off the shopping cart.  I bet he didn't wash it.  But I would have put tinfoil.  Oh, yeah, yeah, tinfoil.  Yeah.  Would have helped a little bit.  Where is he going to get tinfoil?  He's barbecuing with a shopping cart.  That's brilliant.  Put a couple of aisles down from where he stole the steaks, perhaps. 
[00:45:30]  All right, play this.  All right, I've got to record this shit, nigga.  What's it called?  What's it called, motherfucking ghetto families to the fullest, nigga?  Really, really?  Hold on, hold on.  Black skates are hilarious.  You know what I mean?  That's how we do this shit.  We're no grill, nigga.  You feel me?  Check the grill out, nigga.  Look.  Look.  Look, nigga.  Hold on.  I love them.  Hold on, nigga.  That's a mobile grill, nigga.  Grill on wheels.  Mobile grill, nigga.  Grill on wheels.  That's how we do things, man.  Where I'm from, nigga?  You got to eat. 
[00:46:00]  You feel me?  You feel me?  You know what I'm saying?  Season war.  Season war.  That's right.  All we miss is onions on these bits.  You feel me?  You feel me?  It's a whole nother one.  It's a whole language.  You need to re-agree.  I love it.  You know what I'm saying?  Was he marinating it?  Nigga from Publix brought us a Kroger goddamn buggy.  You know what I mean?  Buggy.  All right.  All right.  He's got tongs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shout out to the shell, bro.  Shout out to the shell.  Shout out to the shell.  What's happening?  You know what I'm doing?  Baby Drake.  All right.  All right.  We do this shit.  Get up heaven. 
[00:46:30]  This is just like the barbecues at my house.  It is, but with smarter dialogue.  God, the opes are wishing he was this cool and talked like this.  Oh my God.  These guys sound like New Orleans or where is this from?  Yeah, they're somewhere where they say buggy instead of cart.  You talking about the hood?  Nigga, that's some hood shit.  I think it's like L.A.  Is that great?  Oh, is it L.A.?  Wow.  It's way off.  Out West.  Yeah.  Rocks.  It stinks.  There you go.  That is fan-fucking-tastic. 
[00:47:00]  I couldn't have been farther off if I said New Orleans and it was L.A.  It might.  Yeah, it didn't kind of.  It sounded kind of L.A.  I don't know.  That is fucking great.  That is fucking great.  I like that one.  I get on tears where I will watch videos like that for hours on end and just giggle.  It's so fun.  Are you giggling because they're just really good, solid videos?  No, I'm giggling at the speech.  It's just the body language, the whole thing, the little group of guys. 
[00:47:30]  What a group of them having fun.  That's a great cadence, though.  If that's your natural way of speaking, that's kind of a cool way to talk.  Get the buggy, nigga.  Get the son of the name of L.A.  You nigga.  Shout out to Kroger.  Who gives a shout out to Kroger?  Oh, it's fantastic.  All right, good.  Okay, it's on O&A Show Twitter, and I retweet as well, so go look at that.  I watched the video of some big, big black chick, and she was on top of some guy that 
[00:48:00]  kind of looked black slash Hispanic, and she was pinning him down in the street, and she's  like, I'm not letting you up.  I ain't letting you up.  You're going to hit me.  I ain't letting you up.  I called the police, and he was so concerned, he goes, I got drugs on me!  I got drugs on me!  Really?  And the bitch wouldn't let him up.  So let's watch that.  Panicked.  Panicked.  Is it a long video?  It was good, and it's, it's, uh, they were calling it the greatest cinematography in a  hood rat video ever, because the camera goes around, and, like, but it's all real, but 
[00:48:30]  some guy know how to work his iPhone very well.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  What the fuck was her name?  Oh, man.  Pumpkin?  Pumpkin.  It was pretty good, though.  I found that on my other website that I visit sometimes, and I've noticed a couple of,  uh, a couple of my diatribes have been added to, um, the, the strings of, uh, on their  message.  Congratulations.  Very.  I, I did a bit.  It's a good day for you.  N-word mania.  Yeah.  Without N-word, though.  I did the, um, a bit for Leno one time. 
[00:49:00]  It was opening day in New Orleans.  Oh, yeah?  Covering this.  It was, I didn't go to the Saints game, but I just covered the whole barbecuing and how  people do the course.  Yeah, barbecue.  And, uh, it's, you know, you talk to the white area and, uh, and the black area, like  in the, in the, under the bridge where they kind of, uh, what's it called, tailgating?  Uh-huh.  And the black people were so fucking hardcore.  They were just shouting out to Jay Leno.  But they were just, it was really hard to understand.  Yeah.  But it was such, it was really cool, and the Tonight Show didn't show most of it.  It was like, ah, I don't know. 
[00:49:30]  It's a little too ethnic for a Tonight Show.  Yeah, and it's like, it's like, you're not mocking the guy by showing him.  Yeah, yeah.  I think.  Talk like that.  It's just, that's who the guy is.  I think they see it as that, though.  Yeah, they might.  I love that guy.  I'd probably, I'm glad I was there with the camera crew.  It would not have gone as well for me if you weren't.  Camera saved your ass.  I believe so.  What's you doing here, Nickham?  Yeah.  I could have gotten bad fast.  Yeah.  This guy used to London broil on a tombstone in an abandoned graveyard.  Fuck, yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Who's that?  Who would do that?  Only someone, only an extreme chef would do something like that.  Or a mortician.  A grave digger.  Dave, how do you get that done?  We used to hang out in an abandoned graveyard.  Right.  Wide of railroad tracks.  The last person buried in there was like the 1870s.  The tombstones were all ripped out of the ground.  The little bush that somebody planted on a grave now is a tree.  Mm-hmm.  Paint a nice picture, Stephen King.  Yeah, you do.  Was the moon heavy?  Cloudy night? 
[00:50:30]  We were smoking.  Enough time goes by, there won't be a trace that he ever lived.  From meal of the macabre.  Right.  You think they're going to keep up these graveyards 100 years from now?  Yeah.  Hannah.  Oh, Hannah.  They just moved the stones and built the fucking condos on there.  Right.  I understand.  Yeah.  Then the creepy old guy comes up to you.  You left the bodies.  You left the bodies.  Your screen door.  Okay, Dave.  So how do you do this?  You got to get that tombstone nice and hot.  The tombstones were broken off of the bases.  Mm-hmm.  We took the base, and we took three of them, and made like a little flyer pit. 
[00:51:00]  Took the other.  Oh, so it wasn't.  Tombstone and laid it across the top.  Oh, he did.  Go to Bohack, steal a London broil, and a roll of tinfoil.  Get a flyer underneath the tombstone for a couple hours, and spread out the tinfoil, slap  the London broil on top.  The stone gets really hot.  That's a little creepy, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I said, she was dead in 1870, and we were there.  But at some point, that stone was new.  There were people standing around crying, looking at it. 
[00:51:30]  And their best...  Oh, the black morning outfit.  Yeah.  Now you're using it to cook London broils.  Now some fucking drunk is thieving London broils and cooking it on her fucking...  There's no hope for anyone's legacy in the end.  Smoking a bug, plastic bong next to it.  See?  See?  I used to hang out in an old cemetery in Northport.  It was actually the old...  Remember the old cemetery up on the hill off 25A?  It was like an old fucking cemetery. 
[00:52:00]  Went up there...  I think the Satan kids used to hang in the same...  Yes, it was.  There were some Satan kids, but then there were some kids that just kind of liked the  creepy kind of aspect of it.  We used to go up there and smoke some weed up there, and it was all creepy and quiet  and shit.  Yeah.  It's peaceful.  Yeah, but, you know, dumb fucking kids smoking pot drinking and making...  You can feel all the spirits, though.  Yeah, man.  They're there.  Check out all the empties.  I can feel an energy.  Check out the empties, Mom.  Check out the empties, man. 
[00:52:30]  Dude.  I'm telling you.  I can't get enough of that.  And I'm going to do this as a goof, but I'm this close to a t-shirt.  A t-shirt.  I've been going back with some designs.  I'm this close.  It would move.  I'm going to acknowledge...  I'm going to acknowledge I'm doing it as a goof.  It would move.  They would move.  Too many people are saying they would buy one.  Of course they would.  All right.  Who wouldn't want to check out the empties, man, t-shirt?  All right.  Check out the empties.  You really should do something. 
[00:53:00]  Especially with summer coming up.  You've got to put up a few t-shirts.  I've gone back and forth with designs all day yesterday.  Check out the empties, man.  It might be a complete bust.  That's fine, too.  But check out the empties, man.  I should get the graphic design people that listen to our show to really come up with a design.  Nice.  Check out the empties.  This is the one I'm sort of thinking.  Oh, okay.  That's a nice little crushed beer can.  A crushed beer can.  And then under it just says, check out the empties, man.  Man.  Well, we'll see. 
[00:53:30]  We'll see.  Anyway, where were we?  I forget.  Oh, I found that video, Sam.  Go to this guy's Twitter.  I guess he doesn't care.  People want followers.  Go to BobbyK88's Twitter.  We were talking about April Fool's.  We've got a whole April Fool's thing we're going to get into.  Oh, right.  Oh, good.  Because we don't do them anymore.  And everyone else.  It's April 2nd.  Radio shows in general can't do them anymore.  The companies don't allow it. 
[00:54:00]  But the TV stations are all in.  And we've got some really bad ones.  But there was a radio station that did one.  It's called Laura Loses a Bet.  This infuriated me how stupid this was.  Here's the video.  Laura Loses a Bet.  I believe I'm doing this.  I'll get you for this, Gordon.  Oh, God.  Ew.  So, I almost was able to imagine what she'd seem like arguing with her face.  Shut up, you guys.  Shut up.  Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this. 
[00:54:30]  April Fool's.  Walking naked around the office.  Walking naked around the office.  I'm sorry.  Fuck yeah.  You like that, Jeff?  Oh, it's hilarious.  You didn't see it coming?  No.  Good boy.  Ah.  See, it's a dog named Naked.  Hilarious.  Get it?  We're good. 
[00:55:00]  Good boy.  Her voice.  Her voice.  Is it this right?  You don't like her song?  Look at it.  Look at it.  The opening shot is her where it's like her collar bones up and it looks like she might be naked.  But then she's not.  No, she's not indeed.  The dog is named Naked.  I wish the dog's name was Licked Peanut Butter Out of Her Snatch. 
[00:55:30]  So, that leads us to...  That would be interesting.  That leads us to TV morning shows.  All the big ones.  Wow.  We're talking Fox and Friends.  We're talking Today Show.  We're talking GMA.  All did their April Fool's pranks.  Can't wait.  Should we start...  Which one do you want to start with, Sam Roberts?  Oh, maybe GMA.  Go with GMA?  All right.  We don't have to set this up.  It's just fun.  You know?  Good-natured.  We're learning.  It's always good.  We're learning.  You've got to do good-natured stuff. 
[00:56:00]  I like good-natured.  From Twitter this morning, a blog post about a soon-to-be-launched device, the Twitter helmet,  allowing users to tweet with a simple peck of the head.  You heard me right, peck.  We have contact over at Twitter, so I was able to get my hands on this early sketch of the  contraption, and some video of a staff meeting discussing this new gadget and how it will  revolutionize tweeting.  It was actually leaked online.  You'll see this now as they creep around the corner.  And we actually have a very early prototype. 
[00:56:30]  Did you make this?  Possibly an art class.  So you peck like this.  And that takes...  And the final version...  The final version will have the features you actually saw in the picture.  I mean, it's so...  You barely can tell that I'm tweeting right now.  It's very subtle.  She's just going to go straight through this.  I just tweeted at you, George.  140 characters are going to hurt your neck.  What did you just tweet?  It's also making me very thin right now.  But, no, we want to see if you guys would actually wear this. 
[00:57:00]  I, of course, what George mentioned earlier, he thought it was beautiful.  So if you tweet us your thoughts with hashtag GMA Twitter helmet and let us know what you  think.  You're letting us know it now.  You have to have that look on your face when you're doing it.  Oh, my gosh.  Do I have a Twitter face just like my dancing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of like the white man over one.  She's that chick on the left.  Oh, my gosh.  Isn't working for music.  Okay, guys.  I'm just going to say it now.  It's so cool.  This is not the most boring you, but our friend on Twitter helped me out. 
[00:57:30]  And they said I could keep the prototype.  I watched it twice.  You know what sucks about the April Fool's prank slash joke?  Yeah.  They don't give it any time to just like Edgar.  It's like Edgar.  He just says it and then goes, April Fools.  I mean, that's obviously a horrible one, but they don't even let it sit there for maybe  a break or two.  No, no.  They have to say right away that it's their April Fool's joke.  Right.  Horrible.  That's GMA.  Those guys make millions of dollars each.  Some of those guys are making $10, $15 million a year to just hack it up every morning on 
[00:58:00]  TV.  Hack it up.  Horrible.  Although I love, love.  And you can join me every weekend.  Good Morning America.  I watch the weekend version of Good Morning America.  Yeah.  Because these idiots just laugh their asses off at nothing.  It's the weekend.  They're having fun.  And I can't get enough of it.  What time is it?  It starts at 8, and I'm up early, and I swear I search this out every weekend.  The stuff they laugh at is just mind-boggling. 
[00:58:30]  And then they're all in, every single one of them, over the top, out laughing at each  other.  It's horrendous.  So that was Good Morning America's April Fool's prank.  Where do we go next?  Well, we'll go to Fox and Friends because they had a...  Oh, Ted Cruz.  Ted Cruz.  They're a fun bunch anyway.  Right.  Well, especially with Ted Cruz in the mix.  And the other 364 days a year.  This is Anthony's boys.  Oh, yeah.  My boys over there at Fox News.  Yeah, your boy Ted Cruz was on.  This is your boy, right?  I like it. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  It's good so far.  Absolutely great so far.  Sam.  It's not loaded.  It's your computer, uh...  Well, Sam, you're breaking everything.  Didn't we update our computers?  Yeah.  We did?  Well...  How do computers not work anymore in this day and age?  I got shitty laptops at home.  Well, I will say I was broken screens and everything, and I never have any of these issues ever.  They all work.  Go ahead.  Ted Cruz. 
[00:59:30]  Weeks ago, and there was some street art that was a little unusual.  And I got to tell you, it inspired me.  We're looking at it.  I'm proud to stand with Winston Churchill.  My wife was fairly astonished.  You...  Wait a minute.  What is it?  You have a tattoo of Winston Churchill?  I can smell that cigar from here.  Look, I will note, if you look at the calendar, it might suggest something about what you're saying,  but I'll leave that to others.  I thought we had a big story. 
[01:00:00]  He fell off his chair.  He's laughing so hard.  He fucking got me.  I was like, why would he do that?  He got Hasselbeck, though.  He got Hasselbeck.  He did.  Well, she's stupid.  Oh, is that it?  God damn it.  She's as dumb as they call him.  Yeah.  I was like, that's fucking cool.  Winston Churchill tattoo?  Yeah.  That is kind of nice.  That would make a good tat if you're into Winston...  Winnie Churchill.  You know?  It was a joke, though.  They do give it away quickly.  They do.  Do you see him?  He's like, ah, sure.  But if you look at the bank, look at the calendar.  It's April 1st.  Bye, bye, bye. 
[01:00:30]  Look, a car horn.  That's not a car.  April Fools.  There you go.  That is not.  All right.  I always thought if you did an April Fool's prank, which we did over the years, you let  him hang.  Let him sit on it for a while there.  Yeah.  We did a bunch of them over the years.  The big one is the mayor thing, obviously.  But I don't remember ever letting anyone off the hook, because you just assume it's  April Fool's, so you figure this shit out.  Right.  We're not going to tell you.  Right?  But these people, they do their joke, and then run, April Fool's. 
[01:01:00]  Right away.  April Fool's.  Ah.  Because they've got to move on.  And now, what's the last one?  Time is money.  The Today Show one was good, because it just kind of fell apart.  Oh, unlike the other ones, which were amazingly well done.  I guess the crew was not in on it.  Motley?  The hosts.  Right.  Oh, see, I fought.  Matt Lauer didn't spin this shit?  Well, they all kind of...  Isn't he a brilliant broadcaster?  He should have spun this shit.  None of them.  And that's the thing.  It was spontaneity.  What about Al Roker?  There was spontaneity, and so they were all like, what is this? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, really?  And everything just kind of stopped, and everybody was mad that they'd been pranked.  Oh, really?  Let's check this out.  Matt Lauer should have just started throwing n-bombs.  Right.  That would have been hilarious.  Sitting right next to Al Roker.  I know.  And then Al would get all pissed, and they'd start fighting.  And then you'd just say April Fools, and everything's fine.  Ha, ha, ha.  Right?  We'll be right back.  Let's see this fall apart.  Forgetful from time to time.  This one is for you.  There's a new study, and apparently researchers discovered a quick fix to improve short-term 
[01:02:00]  memory.  It is right inside your cupboard.  They found a small serving of sweets can help in memorizing patterns.  That's a good deal.  I know.  Sorry.  Let's give it a try.  Okay.  We've got letters on the screen.  Probably do.  Okay.  Look at them.  And then what's it?  WZQP.  Yeah.  Should they take a bite?  FGT.  It's by the what?  Oh, the cookie.  Okay.  Let's have the sweets.  Okay.  Ready?  Go.  Okay.  What do the numbers say?  Al doesn't know.  WZQPFGT.  WZQPFGT.  I accidentally bit his finger. 
[01:02:30]  It's so minty.  Is there a minty Oreo?  It tastes like mouthwash.  Does it taste like polka or anything?  I think it's probably toothpaste.  Is it?  Oh, my gosh.  Mine's fine.  No, it isn't.  Yeah.  Well, then there's a mistake.  You are the person who needs that.  Oh, wow.  Did this come apart?  It's a normal Oreo.  See, mine has toothpaste.  I can smell it.  Was this your thing?  Well, it's our producer's joke on all of you.  Mine was delicious. 
[01:03:00]  Well, that's a mistake.  This had to be the Don Magic, Tom Maserile.  It's about as lame as it gets.  I'm glad I saw that.  You can't mess with someone's Oreo.  So, wait a minute.  As an April Fool's joke, you tried to get us all to eat toothpaste.  And I ate it.  My bosses asked me to participate.  If your bosses asked you to jump off a bridge, would you?  Yes, you would.  Yeah, would you?  May I go on record?  I saw this coming from a mile away.  I didn't touch my cookie.  I know!  He's a smart guy. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Really smart.  I think this is racist that they're talking about Oreos and the whole set is like Oreos.  There's black on the outside, look.  And then white on the inside.  I see it.  It's Al Roker.  And then the other chick.  You know what would have been a better April Fool's joke?  Oh.  Is if they gave them Oreos, but instead of the cream filling, they had jerked off a dog onto  it.  And then when they all bit into it, the girl goes, this tastes familiar. 
[01:04:00]  You think someone would have gotten fired for that?  Yeah.  But just to watch them try to be good-natured about it.  Yes.  Like, ah, he jerked a dog off.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  They show a clip of them jerking the dog.  And here's where the cream came from.  Oh, no.  Might be time to get rid of April Fool's Day.  It really is just stupid.  Ah.  Let's say hi to Dan in Colorado.  Dan?  The man, I bet.  No, I never go by that. 
[01:04:30]  Aw.  Sorry.  Hey, I just got a suggestion for you guys.  Oh, good.  And I'm sure you can shit all over me if you want.  Love to.  Why don't you guys get more experts to dial into for a lot of your questions that you guys  have?  Huh.  Example?  Hmm.  Experts.  You guys want experts?  Experts?  That's what this show needs.  This show needs experts.  We need talking heads like on CNN and Fox and MSNBC. 
[01:05:00]  We need experts.  Why would this show need an expert about anything?  Aren't we experts?  We are experts.  At doing radio, my good friend.  We know enough.  Exactly.  We know enough.  We might not get it all right, but we know enough.  We know enough.  Right.  Oh, Christ.  I went to Christ.  550 foot Ferris wheel opens in Vegas.  I saw him building that last time I was out there. 
[01:05:30]  Did you?  Pretty fucked up.  Pretty big, huh?  Amazingly big.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  550 foot.  550 foot.  550 foot.  Yeah.  And it's...  Can I see video of this?  The cars are...  Oh, those are the ones where you can have capsules, they look like.  Yeah, you can have dinner in there and stuff, I hear.  Yeah, you can have a bunch of people in there.  And then as it rotates, the capsules kind of keep...  They stay level as it goes around, but they're all big.  The capsules themselves are pretty big.  All right, I heard of this thing.  We drove by it in the cab, but I'm like trying to look and figure out how big those...  How many people can you fit in each one?  Yeah.  That's a massive... 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that looks cool as hell.  It does.  People are going to enjoy that.  Yeah.  Much more.  This is the High Roller, and it is taking over as the world's tallest observation wheel,  located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip's new open-air social club, Belinda.  Does it go that slow?  I think it does.  It's not a traditional first wheel where it goes,  it's not going to be fucking...  It just takes you up really slowly.  ...allows you to roll deep. 
[01:06:30]  In its 28 different cabins, you can fit up to 40 people.  In each cabin?  No way.  That means 1,120 people can roll at the same time.  Holy crap.  It takes 30 minutes to complete one revolution around.  Now, if those stats aren't impressive enough,  listen to these behind-the-scenes stats that made it all possible.  That was scary.  You got 7.3 million pounds of steel.  You've got 28 cabins.  You've got 8 drive units.  You've got a control system that has 60 wireless networks that have to all work together within milliseconds. 
[01:07:00]  So it's an enormously complex task that that team of people was able to accomplish in under three years.  What makes the roller different than other wheels?  The ride itself.  Turns out it's not just a high roller.  It's a smooth operator, too.  When you really float over the Las Vegas skyline, you don't feel any movement at all.  It's a very smooth, graceful float around the Las Vegas skyline.  And the whole time we have eight video monitors that have a great show experience in addition to the great sight lines that you have. 
[01:07:30]  Guests can throw parties on the roller, corporate dinners.  There's already a wedding on the books.  Oh, and you're even allowed to bring on a rolling bar.  So, in other words...  Nice.  You name it, we can really do it on the wheel.  Designers are hoping the high roller will solidify its place as a new icon on the Vegas skyline.  That's pretty cool.  How do you get people on and off, though, quickly?  It's almost like a train station at the bottom.  Right.  It comes into an area. 
[01:08:00]  But that would suck if you're still on your ride, if it's stopping the whole time, to let people off and let new people on.  That's the question I want to answer.  See, we do need an expert.  That guy was right.  It's going so slow.  It's probably going slow enough where, you know...  As it's moving, you just get off.  Get the fuck off.  The top would scare me, though, when the pod is on top of the outside of the rounded area.  It feels like it's just balancing up there.  Yeah, like it's an egg or something.  It would terrify me.  I do have questions, though. 
[01:08:30]  So, if you're throwing a party in there with drinking, your ride is done.  They've got to clean out that capsule to put more people in.  Maybe you could say, like, I want to go around twice.  Well, but eventually you've got to get off, and eventually they've got to clean up your mess.  That's true.  Before they let a whole other crew on.  Yeah.  How do they do that?  I bet they clean up as it's going around.  Yeah, but they don't want to waste a ride.  They get in there, they fucking have a little cart and everything, they load it in, and then  they get the fuck off.  Yeah, but I don't know.  But to clean it there, you have to go all the way around, which is a half hour. 
[01:09:00]  We need an expert.  We do need an expert.  That guy was right.  That guy was so right.  Jesus.  Fuck happened.  Why don't we listen to these people?  Because there's no way they're getting 40 people off this thing as it's still moving.  That could be rough.  I don't know.  Looks cool, though.  It does look cool.  Must say.  You ever do the one at Niagara Falls?  No.  Basic.  Basic one, but it gives you a nice view of the whole thing.  England's got one of those, too, where it's just giant and goes kind of slow. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, it's basic, but it's kind of cool.  Let me say hi to Ryan in the Bronx.  Ryan.  Expert.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  I just touched on that topic.  I know you guys bring up a lot.  I hope you just said they should get rid of April Fool's Day.  Yesterday, I'm watching that.  I saw it twice on TV.  They're not calling it April Fool's Day anymore.  They're calling it April Fun Day.  It's disgraceful, man.  They're not calling it April Fun Day.  I swear, man.  At first, I saw it. 
[01:10:00]  Opie, you're familiar with Sprout, right?  Like the kids' channel?  Yeah, of course.  It's my nickname.  All right.  I saw that there, and I'm thinking, all right, maybe it's for the kids or whatever.  And then I saw it.  Either it was Channel 12 in the Bronx, or it was Channel 11 News, like on the scroll  on the bottom.  It's fool and sensitive.  Is that why?  Probably.  Or is that a joke?  Was that part of the joke that they were changing it?  No, it's not a joke.  No, it was like, submit your April Fun Day prank to somethingsomething.com.  The fool is like, yeah.  I bet the fool is starting to become a problem. 
[01:10:30]  To the fools out there.  Yeah, I guess it's not nice to them.  Because if you make someone look like a fool, you're kind of bullying them, right?  Yeah, you're mocking them.  You're mocking their stupidity for believing it.  That whole thing started with the radio wizard, I think.  He's the one that came up with the fool is offensive.  That's brutal, man.  All right, I'm out of here.  He is poor radio wizard.  He's pleasant now.  Oh, they're all pleasant.  You see them all sometimes in the halls.  They couldn't be happier to be away from us.  Hop, skipping a jump in their step. 
[01:11:00]  The only one that's still listening is Rob.  Yeah.  You don't think Bladder listens to him?  Oh, hell no.  And the radio wizards, he's not listening.  We are.  But he's pleasant now.  Yesterday's news and those guys' lives.  Yeah, we're just nice small talk with the radio wizard.  Oh, I like it, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, good.  How you doing?  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Have a good weekend.  And his hair has grown completely back.  It's amazing.  They call him, you know what they call him around here?  What?  Mop top.  Mop top.  Yeah.  Turns out that was all stress.  All stress-related baldness. 
[01:11:30]  It's amazing.  I laughed no less than ten times to myself yesterday.  What'd I say?  It was...  Oh, shit.  It was...  That we just openly laughed at Scott Greenstein when he was trying to give us a good trashing.  Me and Jimmy walked by him and he goes, nice rant this morning.  Oh.  And our reaction was to just openly laugh as loud as we can.  Maybe he liked it.  No, his body language said very differently. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  He was not happy.  Not happy.  With yesterday's rant.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Nothing.  Right.  What can you do?  That's what I like saying.  After what do you do?  Wait.  What can you do?  Right?  Am I wrong?  Yeah.  What else is going on?  On Earth?  On the planet Earth.  Oh, I guess... 
[01:12:30]  Oh, the healthcare system had 7 million people sign up.  They made their fucking number.  That's strong.  It's amazing.  Good for them.  Very happy about that whole thing.  Oh, that's right.  6 million of those were people that got their policies canceled and then had to sign up.  Oh, was it right?  No.  Yes.  Yes.  6 million people had their policies canceled.  I am one that did.  A lot of people I know had theirs canceled.  So, the 6...  Is that really that?  Yes.  The 7 million number.  Why can't one news organization say that? 
[01:13:00]  It is.  Fox says it.  Fox is saying it?  But all the rest are, you know, cheerleaders for the president.  It's state-run media.  CNN and fucking MSNBC.  Yeah, so...  People are obviously getting health insurance for the first time in their lives because of Obamacare.  But the other side of this, which a lot of people choose to ignore, is a bunch of people  getting hurt.  Yeah, exactly.  More people are being inconvenienced by this than are being inconvenienced.  More than inconvenienced.  They can't figure out how to pay for it.  Can't figure out how to pay for it. 
[01:13:30]  Can't figure out if they have insurance.  Like I said, there are going to be people...  Because the cutoff day was the 31st.  There's going to be a lot of people that just don't know that they're canceled.  And they're going to go to the doctor or hospital if they have a catastrophe.  And they're going to be told, you don't have insurance.  Right.  And the insurance company is not going to want to hear it.  I got a family member that absolutely cannot afford his medication anymore.  Yep.  Because of Obamacare.  I read.  So, this is a real thing that is happening to people.  But you're lying. 
[01:14:00]  He's lying.  I'm lying.  We're all lying because this is a great thing.  And people got mad yesterday because I said that, you know, he should have waited before he rolled this thing out.  Oh, what?  Waited.  People are getting health insurance for the first time in their lives.  Are they?  But a lot of people are getting hurt by this.  Another thing is that these are people that have gone to the sites, the state-run sites or the federal site for health care,  and ran through all the sign-up procedure.  It doesn't mean they're insured. 
[01:14:30]  It doesn't mean they're paying, they've paid, or they're going to pay their premiums.  There's a lot of people on the lower end of the financial spectrum that are kind of known for not paying their bills, let's just say.  A lot of things get cut off.  They get subsidized electricity and shelter and food.  A lot of benefits come in.  These people, to some extent, still have to pay for a certain portion of their health care.  Some will get free health care.  They won't have to pay anything. 
[01:15:00]  They'll be subsidized 100%.  Others will get a percentage of a subsidy.  But they're still going to have to fill out a check or a credit card or, in some way, shape, or form, pay for this new health care they have.  And a lot of people, I don't think, that are signed up are actually going to pay the fucking bill for this.  And the only way this works, to subsidize the poor people, is if people that are considered middle class or wealthy pay into it to subsidize the poor. 
[01:15:30]  They don't want to do that either.  People are saying that we don't challenge you enough on this.  But I'm kind of in agreement with you on this one.  You can challenge me all you want.  I'm for a health care system, by the way, if you need to know.  I just feel like this thing wasn't ready to roll out, period.  Here's what I liked about Obamacare, and I'll say it.  I like the idea of pre-existing conditions are no longer a barrier to getting insurance.  That's good.  If certain people want to keep their kids on their insurance up through their college years and stuff, that seems like a fair enough thing. 
[01:16:00]  I would have loved that.  There are certain things that are really good and should be kept.  But the whole thing, as far as people getting fucked out of their insurance, corporations not hiring people because of the expense, these things hurt the country and people.  That's real stuff going on.  Of course it is.  But the Obama cheerleaders will never fucking criticize him. 
[01:16:30]  He's uncriticizable.  And it's based purely on his skin color.  I've been told, oh, you don't like Obama because he's black.  No, I don't like Obama because I see him as a shitty president for what I think this country is all about.  Well, he's half black, Opie.  He's a nerd.  He's a nerd.  I don't like him because he's a nerd.  But the people that like Obama and will not criticize him on anything like him because he's black. 
[01:17:00]  And that makes them a fuckload more racist than me who comes up with actual reasons why I don't like him.  And they're policy-based, not color-based.  Yeah.  But they're celebrating.  They got $7 million.  Yeah, good luck to you, which is $7 million.  $9 million if you talk to some of the Democrats, and they include in the Medicaid and Medicare numbers,  the people that would have signed up for Medicaid and Medicare anyway.  I'll have an insurance update, I think, next week. 
[01:17:30]  Are you insured?  Well, now I'm going through it myself.  I've got to change some things up.  So I'll let you know how much more I'm paying.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm going to pay a fuckload more.  When I finally figure out what I need, what I have, I have these options that came in on my email.  And I'm looking.  I go, I don't know how to make heads and tails of this.  But I'll say it again.  It's just annoying to us because we're lucky enough to make a very good living.  But there are people in the middle class, especially, that this is a fucking game changer for a bunch of people.  They're getting fucked, and it's costing them a lot of money, and it's a mandatory thing. 
[01:18:00]  But they don't have.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, in the end, we just get more annoyed.  Yeah.  Jay in Chicago.  Hey, since Sam Roberts wasn't in yesterday, Fez has a new banned word.  It is weirdo.  Weirdo is a hurtful word.  Weirdo is hurtful?  Yes.  I did hear that.  What did you hear?  Well, he, uh...  By the way, I took the wrong phone call.  Oh, I was going to like that.  I think we could have went with Obamacare a little longer. 
[01:18:30]  It didn't come out of nowhere.  I kind of fucked up.  But what do you know about this, Sam, now that we have the guy on the line?  He was upset that a girl who...  Christina, who works here, who used to date Bobo, if you remember her from the show.  Yeah.  Uh, she said he was kind of a weirdo because he was very nice off the air, but very combative  or silent on the air.  And then he was mad that she called him a weirdo.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's another bad word?  The W word.  That's right. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Uh, let me get...  This is the one I did want to go to.  Justin.  Oh.  Go ahead, Justin.  D.C.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I listen to you guys.  I'm just tickled.  I listen to you talk about, uh, the Obamacare and how it's obviously not racist, but how much  you hate it.  Uh, you know, uh, they're talking about destroying, you know, corporations.  My wife's health care tripled every year for her corporation until this came out.  There was no cap on anybody's health care and the preexisting conditions and all the 
[01:19:30]  devastating things that were going wrong.  And now that they have a system out, it's fine.  Not successfully.  No question.  I'm an African-American.  You're not going to hear me say, wait, my flag told me how great it was.  But it's a start.  I hear the...  No, a start would have been to take care of the things that were actually a problem,  like the preexisting conditions.  I have no problem with some aspects of, uh, of this Obamacare thing.  But the way they rolled it out, the, the heavy handed government intrusion in this legislation 
[01:20:00]  is just, it's too much.  It's not a start.  It's a fucking finish.  It's too much at one time.  And it's too intrusive on the American people's, uh, rights and, and their, their freedom  to try to do what they feel is best for them and their families.  And I think a lot of people would have accepted some minor bugs.  Right.  These are not minor bugs.  And I agree with you.  And listen, it's, it's so painful for me to agree with you to say that. 
[01:20:30]  I know.  I agree.  You know, because the fact is that they've done a better job, it could have been more  successful, at least, and more patient.  However, there was no easy solution.  There was no gentle solution to this problem.  They had to do something.  I've got Republican buddies.  They're just hate, anger, and vitriol.  And, oh, the black people, they're the only ones going to benefit.  There are any more white folks who are going to benefit from this than black folks.  We, we're not, we don't have a, we don't corner the market on poverty in America. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, if you didn't, anywhere from Mississippi all through the Midwest.  No, no, I'm not, I'm not bringing race into it.  And I understand that there are plenty of poor white people in this country.  I, I believe me, I understand that.  Uh, I'm just saying the way this was rolled out, the heavy handedness of government intrusion  in people's lives, I, I do consider myself very libertarian leaning, uh, on a lot of things.  And, and to have the government just shoving their fucking nose up everyone's assholes like  this with this type of legislation is, uh, it's insulting. 
[01:21:30]  I don't think it's in the true spirit of, uh, America.  And, um, I don't think it, it allows for people to decide on their own what is best for them  and their families.  And, and even on that, like, unfortunately, I tried to call you yesterday when you were  really ranting, cause that's where I really wanted to get in, but we'll go today where  you're more calm and a little more thought provoking.  I think that the, um, the, the problem is the fix had to start somewhere.  It's kind of like Medicaid 60 years ago. 
[01:22:00]  This was the same anger and fury when Medicaid, Medicaid came out 60 years ago.  People were just enraged.  How dare the government.  And now I'm trying to take some of these Medicaid benefits from them.  Oh yeah.  Medicare benefits from them.  I know.  One of those things where it's going to go through, unfortunately, several different  conditions until we get it right.  I understand that, but it seems that at this time, it's kind of a wash.  People are getting healthcare that have never had healthcare before, but other people are  getting hurt on the other side.  Yeah.  The numbers aren't quite working.  Every time we bring up this topic, I mean, we're not just bullshitting. 
[01:22:30]  And Stephen Virginia's on the line.  He says, because of Obamacare, my sister now owes the IRS $3,500.  The next guy, my daughter's in college and on my plan.  She can't work more than 20 hours without going on Obamacare.  They are.  Jesus.  And again, like I said...  Those are two, and there's more that are coming in.  There really are.  But again, I can't...  I don't want to...  It's hard to argue with you, because my wife having to deal with this issue is seeing some  of the ups and downs.  The question was, how do we start? 
[01:23:00]  Where do we go from here?  You know, if you say we wrote it out too early, if they rescind it now, we're back to ground  zero.  Well, this was this sweeping health care reform, which just turned out to be insurance  reform.  I think a lot of people that were agreeing with this legislation thought that this was  health care reform.  I think people thought they were getting free health care from this legislation when it turned  out to be insurance reform and an obligation of people to be insured.  Right. 
[01:23:30]  And that was a very...  Again, if you remember, it started out as health care reform, and I don't mean to throw  party lines out there again, but the Republicans pushed and pushed and pushed until what became  the center line is where we, as the, I guess, the left side party, moved to, which just  was health care reform.  Well, the Republicans' constituency did not want socialized medicine.  That's just the bottom line, and that's what the health care reform was shaping up  to be.  Exactly. 
[01:24:00]  That's what we have.  But the alternative is what?  Is what we have here, this crap.  The alternative is to...  Go ahead.  He had to give it more time.  He didn't have this figured out totally.  I just checked my Twitter.  I'm telling you, this is real shit going on.  I would have liked to have seen, yeah, insurance reform.  Even God is...  I do this in Maryland, and actually I'm a member of the legislature in Maryland, and I agree  with you.  It's just they rush it out.  They kind of close their eyes and do some darts.  Yeah.  But the issue was, the other side was, well, no, let's wait. 
[01:24:30]  And I'm like, yeah, we've been waiting for 25 years.  Hey.  That's the worry is how long do you wait?  I understand.  Justin, I just checked my Twitter.  These are the last three tweets that came in.  Even God is having a problem with his health insurance.  He writes, I now can't afford to pay my child support, maintenance, alimony now because  of Obamacare, and I make a good living, okay?  Hold on, hold on.  My unemployed sis-in-law went from free health care for her and her son to having to pay $300  a month.  That's a lot for someone like that. 
[01:25:00]  The next one.  These are all in a row.  My insurance went up to $210 a week.  I have to work one day a week just to pay for my insurance.  And these deductibles are killing people.  These deductibles are now so fucking high that if somebody does have some type of medical  emergency or even office visits and whatnot, they are responsible for the first, in some  cases, $5,000 of their medical bill before the insurance even kicks in.  And that's an insanely high number for a lot of working people. 
[01:25:30]  The reason this doesn't bother me as much, even though I think it needs to work, is because  I want to see people have insurance.  I want everybody to have some kind of health care, even though I know they can get it.  But we waste so much money in other places, and I know it's a different thing, but  money doesn't care where it goes.  It's all where you put it.  Stop fucking wasting it on other countries and giving other countries billions of dollars.  Fuck Egypt.  Put that money here and insure people.  Sir, do you know where the United States stands as far as spending on its people's health 
[01:26:00]  care as opposed to the rest of the world?  No.  We are numero uno.  We spend more money than any other country on health care.  Yet, there's still a problem.  There's still this...  If you look at the pharmacy, and I'll say this, I went on a cruise with my wife.  I watched a little boy break his shoulder.  It cost him $264 to completely get it cashed.  We were on a cruise, South African doctors. 
[01:26:30]  My point is, you come here in America and do that, what about, what, $15,000, maybe $20,000.  Oh, yeah, easily.  Yeah, yeah.  Also, again, there's huge reform that's also to do with...  And I know you're on an entertainment show, but I'm not going to try to make it real serious.  But, I mean, it also has to do with the pharmaceutical companies.  But, like you said, but we're capitalists, right?  Right.  We want to motivate them to do great things.  You know, we're doing it.  They've got to make great amounts of money.  Same with going to med school.  You go to Germany where the teachers and doctors make about the same.  And they've got a better health care system and a better education system, but it's also a socialist republic. 
[01:27:00]  I was going to say, if we're going to have true health care reform, you've got to look at all those things you just mentioned.  Right.  Those problems across the fucking board.  Right.  The reason we spend more, too, is because we also probably have the highest medical costs.  So that's going to...  That's exactly my point.  Well, everything costs a lot.  But, you know, that's why you'll get those kids with heart problems in other countries, and where the fuck do they fly them?  They fly them here to the United States.  So the most acute problems, we are the place for them. 
[01:27:30]  Exactly.  But there's a cost to that.  There you go.  And that's where it comes from.  Every time somebody doesn't pay when they go to the emergency room, we pay.  My wife's insurance company, for her people, she owns a corporation.  Every year, they multiply it by three to the point where she couldn't afford.  Now she's on the Obamacare, or her people are, because she could not afford to keep up.  We had people on our health care that we had fired, but they let them work maybe one hour a week just because they had a pre-existing condition that would not have allowed them to go somewhere else. 
[01:28:00]  And the thing was, you can't revamp part of it without revamping all of it.  Yeah, I know.  Again, I'm not saying there's a decision like it's a perfect system.  And I appreciate, you know, yesterday's conversation was a little more entertaining because you guys were a lot angrier.  Yeah, we were all a little angry yesterday.  I was all amped, too.  I'm driving to the statehouse.  I was all amped with you.  But at the end of the day, hopefully we'll have several different renditions.  It's always the end of the day.  But this is truly hurting the middle class. 
[01:28:30]  And you've got to keep the middle class healthy for America to work.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's annoying to us.  We're above the middle class almost everyone in this room.  Morally, yes.  And if you're below the middle class, this is great for you probably.  But the middle class is absolutely getting hurt by this.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  Hurt the middle class.  Sick of the middle class.  That's my motto.  They're spoiled hurt the middle class.  All right, Justin.  Thank you for your phone call.  Middle class has been getting away with murder in this country for too long.  I'm tired of this. 
[01:29:00]  Bastards.  We've got an intern here on the Opie and Anthony show that has an Obamacare story.  What?  Who is it?  Which intern?  The boy.  The guy that lives just across the bridge?  Yeah, just over the bridge.  GWB, just across the bridge.  What's his name?  His name's Adrian.  How long is his name?  A week or two?  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  You fuck.  He had to be Adrian.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Now this guy.  Here he is.  I've seen him around.  What do you do here?  There he is.  He's an intern. 
[01:29:30]  He's the guy that wore the Duke shirt when the fucking Duke porn star came in.  More neediness.  Look at me.  I'm like you.  Could you be my girlfriend?  Maybe you'll blow me.  I was hoping.  Yeah.  Who wasn't?  Got to be honest with you.  What's your Obamacare story?  What happened?  Basically, I just know I get a prescription.  Basie?  Yeah, you didn't say Basie.  You said Basie.  I said Basie.  Yeah.  A little nervous?  A little bit.  You can count on that.  I went to get my prescription. 
[01:30:00]  Fucking boo.  I'm going to have my fucking ears replaced.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, sir.  I wanted to pick up my prescription.  And normally, before the whole Obamacare thing kicked in.  Thorazine?  Lithium?  What's up?  No, I'm paying for a sleeping pill.  AZT and Cialis.  Talking about missed messages.  Why are you paying for a sleeping pill?  What's up?  You're too young for a sleeping pill.  What's your problem?  Since I've been a little...  Since I'm going to say around 7th grade, I got a pretty bad couch in playing football.  Apparently he takes a handful before he comes here. 
[01:30:30]  I'm teasing, of course.  Wait, hold on.  A concussion can make you not sleep well.  Yeah, apparently.  That's what the doctors have told me.  I've gotten multiple concussions.  And since then, I've had trouble sleeping.  Were you a big football guy?  Were you good?  I played football.  I was alright.  We played on a pretty good team.  My kids will not be playing football.  No.  That's the only thing I'll say.  Fuck.  I got a couple concussions.  Knock their heads around.  How'd you get it?  All football?  All football.  Once wrestling.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  That's crazy.  So, because of that, you can't sleep well? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Ever since I was, I'm going to say, 11, 12.  What, do you wake up a lot or you just can't do it all?  Wait, you were getting that many concussions as a 12-year-old?  At 12.  No, I only got...  What's wrong with you?  I got my first big one that was serious when I was 12.  And then, throughout high school, I got a ton of them.  Wow.  And was always having...  I would sleep, like, three hours a night.  Yeah.  Tops.  I hear you.  But before Obamacare, I was paying about $20 on a copay whenever I picked it up.  And then, after it kicked in, I went to pick up my prescription.  And they told me I had to pay $170 copay every time I come in until my parents pay $3,500 
[01:31:30]  for some fee.  Yeah.  Into the insurance company.  It's amazing.  People are saying it's affordable health care, but it's like anything else.  If the deductibles or the copays are too high, it defeats any purpose.  But they never talk about the deductibles or copay because they just want to say, look  at this affordable health care.  So, they're just talking the premiums of the insurance.  And then, you got a guy like this.  How old are you?  Where the fuck are you coming up with that money?  I'm not.  I mean, we pay you very well here, but I don't see... 
[01:32:00]  Oh, that's right.  How old are you?  I'm 22.  That's...  22.  That's what I'm talking about.  You're going to be retarded by 30.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That poor fucking brain.  Just knocked your brain around.  Yeah.  Stop for the concussions, okay?  How'd you get it?  Head-on fucking...  Head-to-head.  One time I went off a wrestling mat and hit my head on a gym floor.  Oh.  Fucking mats there.  Jesus.  A few more mats for the floor.  Maybe sports isn't for you.  Jesus.  Yeah, maybe...  You still like the... 
[01:32:30]  Like sports?  Yeah, I still help out.  Coach a little bit of wrestling.  Oh, look at you.  You're like Rudy.  So other kids could have concussions.  That's good.  Yeah, that's good.  That's great.  Share the fucking burden.  You got a heart on all you wrestling?  No, but we had a kid on our team who pretty much every match would have a heart on.  Wow.  Yeah.  Would you do the finger up the ass move?  It was a finger up the ass.  It was right here.  This bone.  Yeah.  Right along the side of your hand before your thumb.  And you do that?  Yeah.  What would that do?  It would?  Yeah, because once you catch that, you're immediately re-responsive like that. 
[01:33:00]  I like scratching right on their tailbone and they go, brr, brr, and their ass comes  up.  I'd rather lose every match than fucking asshole play.  Well, you might as well jam a finger and they have to lose because they ejaculate.  You milk their prostate.  We would add tickle in here, too.  If you dig in the ribcage, that would break somebody down.  That's fucking...  That actually would make me break down.  Digging in real hard like that.  A good tickling?  Jeez, man.  That's all legal, too, huh?  Yeah.  Legal moves.  They just dig into your...  I don't get it.  I never got real wrestling. 
[01:33:30]  Well, if you just...  Even with that tickling...  I like to face shit.  It's always mo.  I think you got to be half queeb.  Half quay.  We are one half queeb, one half quay.  Yeah, slightly quay as well.  Wow.  So you're getting fucked.  All right.  Good quote.  But apparently, you're full of shit and you're lying because that's what every Democrat will say  when you say that you're getting fucked over from Obamacare.  That means absurd.  It's extremely selfish by the administration to roll this out.  It is.  Extremely selfish. 
[01:34:00]  Under the guise of some legacy.  And that fucking Nancy Pelosi...  Oh, she's the worst.  She's a monster.  She's a monster.  She's dumb.  She's just a dummy.  She loves doing Obama's bidding.  She's like Renfield.  Wasn't that guy?  Dracula's fucking little sidekick buddy, Renfield?  Something like that.  Sound it?  I think it was.  That intern is a good kid.  Oh, there you go.  Club Soda Kenny has your back.  There you go.  That intern's a good kid.  I assume he is. 
[01:34:30]  That's the co-signing you want from Kenny.  There he is.  Well, good for you.  That sounds great.  So you're not getting your sleeping pills.  What's up?  No.  Oh, shit.  Are you sleeping?  Well, since I started this, it's a little bit easier for me to fall asleep.  I mean, I'm here.  Of course, just listen to the show.  I really appreciate that.  That's what I want to hear after 20 years.  It's really easy to fall asleep after hanging out with you guys.  Well, I get up around 3.30 and then I'm usually out of here in the afternoon and then  class at night. 
[01:35:00]  What was the sleeping pill of choice?  I believe it was Trezor.  Is that strong?  Sounds like it's a strong one.  Did it work for you?  Because I know someone who takes that.  It did, yeah.  So you're directly being denied your medication due to the cost because of Obamacare.  Yeah, pretty much.  This is a guy.  This isn't 10 degrees of separation.  We heard from a guy that heard from a guy.  This is a guy right here not getting the medicine he needs because of the cost incurred from Obamacare.  I got, like I said, I got one family member who can't afford his medication, period, because 
[01:35:30]  of Obamacare.  It's only my family's not, both my parents work full-time.  Yeah.  Tell them to pay for it.  And they had insurance and it was fine.  Yeah.  It was all fine before that.  You know, I hear tell you could keep your insurance if you're happy with it.  Nice.  And keep your doctors that you've been going to.  Let's say you have a heart disease and you go to a special clinic for it or what have  you and you've been with that same doctor for years.  Um, oh, you might have to change him.  You know what the pain in the ass of the records being changed over a new relationship with 
[01:36:00]  a new doctor?  Like, this is the shit that people are dealing with to ensure one million new people.  And that's the, the, the, the net numbers.  And that all means more, uh, doctor's visits too, by the way.  Of course it does.  Because like you said, your old doctors got all the basics.  Oh yeah.  Oh, you're having that thing again or whatever.  Okay.  But now it's like, I don't even know what that thing is.  So we're going to have to, you know, start from the beginning here.  And again, I'll be accused of being a liar, but these are facts.  These are things that are known. 
[01:36:30]  They're out there.  The news, of course, state run media will not report it.  It's like fucking, uh, the, the, the task news agency of the eighties in Russia.  That's what CNN, MSNBC, uh, all the networks.  That's what they've turned into just a fucking, a loud speaker for the white house.  Yuck.  Disgusting.  I'm pretty much with you on this.  Trazodone is an antidepressant.  Is that true?  Are you sad?  Yeah, it's sleep as a byproduct of that.  Are you sad?  Yeah, at least sleep is a byproduct.  No.  What are you sad about?  What happened?  Let's break this down.  What are you sad about? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, what's that matter?  I'm from sad music.  You said all my life isn't going like I thought it would be this boy.  Baby gonna cry.  Baby gonna cry.  You're a squirt, sports fans.  Oh, the bullying.  We're very understanding.  Terrible.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  No, I was, they gave me a couple of things that weren't, didn't, did nothing for me.  It didn't do it to me. 
[01:37:30]  They won't help me.  It's for help and it won't help me.  I play mommy and daddy.  I'm gonna cut.  Oh, shit.  Where the fuck are we?  That's all right.  You're a good guy.  You're all right.  Things will be good.  So what did they give you for it before it was no good?  I don't really remember.  This was when I was 16, 17 years old.  They were getting all kinds of, you know, through the mill early on. 
[01:38:00]  16 years old.  You're fucking yourself up early.  That's the, no one understands me, man.  Man, I have my own life, man.  I don't need to live by your rules.  Your rules.  Oh, shit.  That is hilarious.  Oh, it is fuckery.  We love it.  The only reason we know this is because we did it.  Yeah.  Way back in the 1800s.  Right, we've been through that.  Well, good luck. 
[01:38:30]  I hope that works out.  They've got to pay $3,500 before that copay drops.  And then I think it only drops to, like, $70 or something like that.  Jesus Christ.  And it was $20.  Yeah, it used to be $20.  Fuck, man.  It's absurd.  I mean, it's crippling.  It is.  We didn't set this up.  We could do this all day.  Well, we did, but there are real people like this.  Yes.  I'll read in the scripture.  Wow.  All right.  What's your name?  Adrian.  Adrian.  Oh, that's right. 
[01:39:00]  They said that.  I am.  I'm going to try to remember your name.  Because Kenny vouches for you.  Yeah.  He's a good kid.  Don't vouch for him.  Big fan of Kenny as well.  Yeah.  Nope.  Why don't you marry him?  Why are you a big fan of Kenny?  Yeah, exactly.  Adrian.  Kenny's very straightforward.  The only guy around who just tells me what to do.  Straightforward is a great word for autistic.  Sway's really late today.  His show starts at 8.  It's 825.  Get in there.  They need you. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, my God.  We got a break.  It's been a long time now.  All right.  Go do your wine and walking.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  All right.  We'll step aside here.  Ah, shut up.  This was an AF song. 
[01:40:00]  Local H?  It was it?  Local H.  Local H, right?  Yeah.  Those douche chill videos are doing very well from the past.  I might have another one.  We might have another one.  And we have that audio from yesterday.  Or Joe.  Speaking of...  Should we do that?  Speaking of AF, the beach tips video is doing very well. 
[01:40:30]  Of course.  How would it not?  It's wonderful.  We're showing you how you pick up a girl at the beach.  It's horrendous.  But during the video, it says currently serving a two-week suspension.  Yeah.  And it got me a thinking.  And I was trying to figure out why we were suspended that time.  We were suspended at least three times in Boston.  Yeah.  For real.  It wasn't fake shit.  Those are for real.  They were just trying to control us.  And then in the end, they obviously couldn't. 
[01:41:00]  We got our asses fired.  Bastards.  So I was trying to figure out what the suspension was.  Because we're pretty happy in the video.  Yeah.  And then our old...  It's because we were off for two weeks paid.  Well, that's what I was going to get at.  Because Brian, our old intern, is now probably pushing 40.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He was 17 at the time or something.  He was a wee little lad.  He's got to be like 35 now.  Oh, I don't know.  He sent me the clip.  He's got a pretty good YouTube channel, by the way. 
[01:41:30]  What's his YouTube channel?  Just his name?  Brian Broski?  Yeah.  He was funny.  B-R-O-S-K-I-E.  Brian Broski.  He's got some good old clips from the radio show and also some other real rock TV clips.  He was the one that came over Rock Hole.  Yeah.  Rock Hole.  So he wrote me.  He goes, you guys got suspended for reading the WOW memo.  Ah.  And it was kind of a power struggle between our program director, Dave Douglas, and us.  And then in the end, Bruce Mittman, our GM, saw it our way. 
[01:42:00]  And he still suspended us because there was some shit going on.  Yeah.  But he goes, look, we'll pay you.  But we can't tell the media we're going to pay you.  Brian, we've got to get you guys off the air because this is a real thing that is happening.  Just to appease outside forces.  But what happened was, and it's Wednesday today, Whip Him Out Wednesday, we started that  up in Boston, but the station never embraced it.  We did it for about seven to eight weeks, solid.  And then it got completely out of control and people were making homemade WOW signs. 
[01:42:30]  We wanted to make it official and get a WOW bumper sticker.  They have no part of it.  They said no.  Yeah.  I mean, all those WOW stickers you see, that was when we moved to New York.  And then BCN embraced it when we were syndicated back to Boston.  But where it started at AF, Dave Douglas just didn't understand any of this edgy shit.  And he wanted to squash it.  And WOW became massively huge when we came to New York.  You couldn't get in a car without seeing a WOW sticker.  There are a lot of those fucking things out there. 
[01:43:00]  So up there, it got out of control quickly.  And Eileen McNamara wrote for the Boston Globe.  I don't know if she still does.  Who knows?  And the Boston Globe is one of those hoity-toity, you know, papers.  Hoity and toity?  And she just killed us.  Yes, she did.  Killed us in the Boston Globe.  But me and Anthony were like, who gives a fuck she killed us?  This is great exposure for us.  We like kink.  Especially when you have nothing.  People still don't really know who you are. 
[01:43:30]  If you get an article like that at the Boston Globe, that's going to get people going, wow,  I've got to listen to these idiots.  That's what gets you over the top.  You actually turn people on, even though it's a negative article.  That's not your target demo.  Anyway, the Boston Globe.  So, we got the clip of us getting suspended.  This is what we did.  We went against Dave Douglas' orders.  So, we actually have the sound of us reading the memo?  Yes.  Oh, nice.  So, I guess the setup, yeah, the Boston Globe article comes out, and then Dave gives us 
[01:44:00]  this little talking to behind the scenes, and then gives us a memo to make it official.  So, this is all the stuff I don't want you doing anymore, or you will get a two-week suspension.  Whoops.  So, me and Anthony said, fuck this, and went on the air and read the memo.  Yeah.  And, of course, it's like, like I said, like, I don't know, 15 years, 16.  Holy shit.  98.  So, 16 years ago.  So, you're going to hear some douche chilliness in here. 
[01:44:30]  A little douchiness?  Of course.  No, we won't.  It's just fine.  Is there some douchiness?  Yeah, we're basically taking on the mad, mad.  Oh, no, we were, huh?  Oh, yeah.  And you aren't going to tell us, man.  No.  One of the lines is, no one's going to censor me, man.  Oh.  No, it's not.  I don't believe it.  That's not one of the lines.  Oh.  But.  Oh, boy.  Looking past the doucheiness, the confidence is ridiculous. 
[01:45:00]  And we didn't know if they were going to fire us over this for real.  And we were making no money.  And it worked.  We kind of had an audience, but I don't know.  Maybe we were taking a chance, a big fucking chance here is what I'm saying.  That's funny.  How many empties are in this video?  Oh.  Check out the empties, man.  Oh, this video?  No, it's just an audio clip from our radio show.  What year are they?  Ninety, probably seven.  So, go ahead. 
[01:45:30]  WAF, the only station that really rocks.  That's Cowboy Mouth.  And Jenny says, it's Opie and Anthony.  What's up, man?  What's up, what's up, what's up?  The censored version of the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't like the way it sounds.  What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?  What's up, what's up, what's up?  I'm like, what's up, man?  Man.  Hey, man.  Oh, are we just too hip for the room?  Wow, a couple of young teenagers just fucking spitballing.  Yes, a couple of kids took over the station.  Hey, you talk like that, people are going to think you're younger than you are. 
[01:46:00]  I'm sticking to that.  Oh, did we just fucking.  What's up, what's up, what's up?  Right out of high school, right into the station, man.  Fuck, that could be a new t-shirt, but it's just, what's up, what's up?  What's up, what's up?  I wish I added a little something at the end.  Like Brother Man.  What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?  Like a gun shop somewhere.  Oh, boy, wow, that's good.  Did you back up?  Because I said it's the uncensored, it's the censored version.  Censored version.  Look out.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, what's up, what's up? 
[01:46:30]  The censored version of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm sure you've heard us talking about that for the last three or four days.  Eh.  I've got a problem with the whole thing.  Yes, I have a major problem with the whole thing as well.  Rocco, on your radio next, we're just about out of here.  Probably for a while, to be totally honest with you, because we've had it.  Obviously, tomorrow is supposed to be Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  We're not allowed to talk about it on the radio anymore, because we've been censored.  We were sat down yesterday, and we were given a memo that we're not allowed to read on the air. 
[01:47:00]  Or refer to.  Or refer to.  The memo reads.  And this is no joke, and I need a lot of you guys to listen and pass the word, because we're only going to have one shot at this.  See, this is the difference.  Like, radio guys did this as a fake shit.  A little fake shit.  That's why it gets frustrating.  But this is the real deal, yeah.  We decide, me and A, we're like, we've got to do this.  And I remember talking to you going, they could fire us over this, but we have to make a stand against this Dave Douglas guy, because he doesn't understand our vision. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, there was a memo.  I get it.  That's right, guys.  Oh, there was a memo.  Your voice, like a fine wine, Opie, over the years.  Like a fine wine, because I don't know who that is.  Yeah, because your voice is definitely similar to that.  Pretty similar, but.  I think, all kidding aside, I think all the screaming I did over the years has really just fucking, yeah, scratched it up.  Like man-leaded up a little.  Or maybe I finally reached puberty. 
[01:48:00]  Some people are like, are you holding your nose?  It's like, hey, how you doing?  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  But I always, this is good.  Why do I do this to myself?  I always had allergies.  I got my allergies.  Don't you remember?  I always had allergies.  I have my allergies.  Because I was allergic to cats, so why not have two cats?  Have two cats, right.  And even if you kept your house perfect, it was always in you.  That was the dumbest thing ever. 
[01:48:30]  Is it in you?  But I fell in love with these cats, and I couldn't just get rid of them.  I wouldn't.  And then, of course, when I split with the ex, she couldn't wait to get rid of them.  One of my cats had to go to a gay couple, and the gay couple didn't like the name.  So after 12 years, they changed the name of Barbara.  My cat.  Why would you name a cat the queer killer?  Oh, wow.  But if you're going to adopt someone else's cat, why would you change their name 12 years into it?  Well.  And at that point, I knew I just couldn't have cats anymore, because the allergies were ridiculous. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  But I just want to admit, I was always a allergic.  I love it.  Talking through my nose in between, sneezing.  There's your cool rock jock.  He's got allergies and a lot of tissues.  A lot of tissues there in front of him.  All right, continue.  One shot only, okay?  This is the memo that me and Anthony were greeted with on Monday when we came to work.  Confidential.  Do not read or refer to any part of this memo on the air. 
[01:49:30]  June 23, 1997, to Opie and Anthony.  From Dave Douglas, our lovely boss, referring Whip-em-Out Wednesdays.  The promotion you have been airing on your program for the past eight weeks, called Whip-em-Out Wednesdays,  Listen to this.  has had generated an enormous reaction from our listeners.  Truly a remarkable promotion.  However, the negative backlash has been realized, as we predicted, and will only continue.  In short, we've had our fun.  Now let's move on.  Because of the serious nature of these complaints, it is necessary to ensure that we end this now. 
[01:50:00]  There is to be no further on-air promotion of Whip-em-Out Wednesday on WAF.  Neither of you or any studio guest or caller may make reference to Whip-em-Out Wednesday effective immediately.  This includes any and all song parodies with references to Whip-em-Out Wednesday.  Wait, wait, wait.  Here we go.  Holy fuck.  I forgot how.  See, as much as it's like old audio, isn't that infuriating?  It's enraging, yeah.  This is what we had to deal with, with this guy.  And we proved him wrong, because when we moved to New York, which is a much bigger market than Boston, 
[01:50:30]  we did WOW with the full support of the company.  Wow stickers.  Wow stops.  Matter of fact, it got to a point, I've got to find the old picture,  there was a WOW billboard in Times Square with our names on it.  I got the picture of that in my bar downstairs.  I had that, uh, Ange had that framed for me and stuff.  Right.  It's great.  It's cool as fuck.  We just knew.  Yeah, I mean, why would you send out a memo and say, don't, it's like having a meeting with the staff and saying,  don't talk about it on the air.  It's like, why would you do that?  It's pathetic.  Yeah, no, to this day, management tries to do that to you. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  They don't understand that, you know, when you say, don't talk about it on the air,  that's the first thing we're going to do.  Yeah, don't mention it.  Because it makes for good radio in the end.  Why is it a secret if our audience knows we're, like, why is that a secret?  I don't know.  It's not NASA?  Yeah, we deal with that to this day.  But back to, can you, can you believe this memo?  Um, yeah.  I mean, it's, that's sickening.  And then it, uh, all right, and then it continues.  I gotta say something, too.  I gotta, I gotta read something.  All right, go ahead. 
[01:51:30]  In addition, there'll be no mention or reference to the article that ran in the Saturday, June 21st edition of the Boston Globe,  titled, Like, Wow, No, Not a Bit by Eileen McNamara.  Any violations of these policies will result in a two-week suspension without pay for both of you,  as will any mention of this memo on air.  So there you go.  That is why we have been, uh, not bringing up the subject.  That's why we've been censored for, uh, the last three or four days.  And obviously, now they gotta suspend us.  But I don't, I don't really care, because I cannot be censored. 
[01:52:00]  Now, you know what my problem is?  I cannot do, I cannot do this radio show and be censored.  Simple as that.  You know what my problem was?  If you remember, a week ago, we, uh, we had a meeting, me and Opie.  Yes.  Because this whole wow thing didn't get out of hand.  And we were trying to...  Opie and I!  You know, young kids.  Young bucks wouldn't talk like that, Jimmy.  Maybe your grandma talks like that.  Not a couple of young up-and-comers.  Yeah, even though it's a guy who can't be censored, I'm more annoyed at the memo than I am even  wanting to goof on that. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, I know.  True.  True.  And we didn't want to be censored by that guy, because we understood the rules of radio.  We understood that guy knew nothing about radio, too.  And we understood exactly what the FCC would fine you for.  That wasn't it.  In our minds, especially back then, we thought that was, that's all we had to worry about.  None of this other side nonsense.  And could you imagine that, the Boston Globe is a big deal, and they're writing about you  and killing you.  I don't, I haven't read the article in years, so I don't know exactly, but I remember it 
[01:53:00]  was bad.  And we can't, we have a forum, and we can't even defend ourselves.  We can't talk about it.  Are you kidding me?  It's pathetic.  Isn't it pathetic?  If we would have listened to Dave, we would have been nowhere.  Of course.  Nowhere.  There are behind-the-scenes radio guys that do know what they're doing, but there are  so many of you behind the scenes that you're, you really, that's why you're behind the  scenes, because you're not creative.  You're not creative.  You don't know.  And this is not all of them.  You don't know what works.  There are some very smart guys, but there are some just non-creative duds.  He had no clue what was supposed to be done in a circumstance like this, and this came 
[01:53:30]  about a lot of times when things would happen, and Dave would be like, oh, we ought to treat  it like this, or we should do this.  He never knew what an on-air personality or staff should do in a circumstance, and this  is a prime example.  Right.  Whip them out Wednesdays, getting attention, negative attention, whatever the fuck it is.  Okay.  It's in the Boston Globe.  You don't say don't talk about it ever again.  Right.  That's the opposite of what you do.  Yeah, or, I mean, if you have to go down that road, try to spin it. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, something.  But you've got to acknowledge it.  Do something not to say that everyone has to stop talking immediately.  What a dope.  I forgot how fucking bad this was.  That was like, don't mention anything about it.  Right.  And what was the other...  Clip songs?  What was the other meeting that is being referenced in this?  I don't know.  Me and you had a meeting.  We always had meetings.  Yeah.  The famous...  Consider me the third member of the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Because he used to get nervous on a daily basis because he had no idea what we were going  to do on that show. 
[01:54:30]  Of course we did some douchey stuff, but we also did some pretty edgy things.  And he wanted to know everything before we did it.  He needed to know everything before we did it because he just...  He didn't know what the fuck we were going to do next.  But knowing us over the years now, you know, people that have listened to the program,  they probably know we really don't know what we're doing detail-wise on a given day.  So how the fuck are we going to tell him?  And why would we?  And why would we?  Exactly right.  So I'll continue with this old clip from 97. 
[01:55:00]  We had a meeting, me and Opie.  Yes.  Because this whole wow thing did get out of hand.  And we were trying to figure out a cool way where everyone, both sides could be happy.  Could be happy.  And we don't look like dicks.  Like pussies, basically.  And we did come up with a way to, you know, calm the whole issue down in a way that made  me and Anne happy and management happy.  Right.  Then they turned around because one article was written about us in the Globe that we're  not even allowed to defend ourselves upon.  Right.  This lady attacked us like a vicious dog and we weren't allowed to retaliate or talk about 
[01:55:30]  it on the radio.  And because of that, now they want, you know, wow, to completely go away.  And those guys are a bunch of pussies.  They couldn't come in here and, you know, get rid of it themselves.  They forced us to do it.  And it wasn't an issue where it went from we were in a meeting one week talking about  wow and how we're going to deal with it to them getting a couple of letters and us automatically  now getting threatened with our jobs.  Yes, exactly.  If we talk about it again, it went from one extreme to the other. 
[01:56:00]  Exactly.  And we don't think that's fair at all.  Not at all.  That's a form of censorship.  I mean, AEF has every right in the world to come in here and stop the wow promotion.  Of course they have every right.  The company that owns AEF has that right as well.  But they don't have the right to force us to stop it.  No.  Not at all.  And threaten us with suspensions and jobs.  That's censorship.  They want to come in and say, hey, people, stop doing wow.  Right.  That's fine.  Whatever.  Basically, Whipin' on Wednesday was a concept where it was a fun little thing that guys 
[01:56:30]  would put the wow on their car and the girls would flash if they want.  All right.  It was a voluntary basis.  It still is a voluntary basis because I'm not going to tell you guys not to do it anymore.  And, you know, personally, I could care less if another girl flashes.  That isn't even the issue anymore.  No, that's not the issue anymore.  Okay.  But no ladies were supposed to be harassed.  We never encouraged harassment of the ladies.  Okay.  It was supposed to be a voluntary thing.  Most ladies, you know, did it because they wanted to. 
[01:57:00]  They wanted to.  Right.  And the guys, you know, laughed, had a good time, and they moved on.  But we got a couple of letters.  We got an article in The Globe by Eileen McNamara, which we were told also we couldn't refer to,  which I thought was weird that we couldn't even refer to any press that we got.  This is making me so angry.  This is a big deal, by the way.  This is a turning moment for the Opie and Anthony show.  Because I think this was the first time we said, fuck you.  We know exactly what we're doing.  And if it means our job, so be it. 
[01:57:30]  If we would have fucking folded to those guys back then, you would not be listening to us today.  There's no way.  I remember.  Because now, I mean, we joke about it, but if we get fired tomorrow, whatever.  We got really good lives.  But back then, I wasn't even paying my bills properly.  I was juggling like anyone else.  I'd have been back in the attics.  I was juggling like anyone else.  We were taking a major chance here.  Look at her, too.  By the way, Eileen McNamara.  I'm looking at her picture.  How pathetic.  What were we going to say, Jimmy? 
[01:58:00]  I'm sorry.  You said it positive.  That's okay.  Just the cowards behind the scene in radio.  Yeah.  Which is why they're not.  Because they probably never had the courage to go out and do what they want to do.  Right.  And this is, again, not all behind.  Some guys like producing or whatever.  But there are so many fucking cowards in this business.  They just lurk behind the, don't talk, don't say that.  Not stuff that you don't even need to say.  Right.  Just don't talk about the, why wouldn't you talk about the Globe article?  This was a huge catalyst for us, man. 
[01:58:30]  I mean, our listeners got behind us big time after this.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it was the, it's that classic thing people like.  You know, the underdog.  Right.  And we're getting bullied by management and by the Boston Globe.  And then, you know, we come out and speak out against it.  Right.  People fucking loved that.  And then we're all in.  And a mere 10 months later, we were gone.  Because this is June of 97.  We were gone.  Obviously, April.  Yeah.  April, I don't know.  We got fired April 8th, I think.  That was a very, a very important few months for us, though, up there. 
[01:59:00]  Because then we just.  Then we said.  What we did here.  Right.  We did for the rest of our fucking time up there.  How much more time did you have after this?  10 months, about.  10 months of bashing heads with these motherfuckers.  Right.  And just building our own brand up and saying fuck you to them.  Yeah.  We had, we had the audience.  The fans were rabid.  Oh, man.  And we said, all right, here we go.  Let's do this.  It worked well.  And then all of a sudden, you know, people around the country started to get to know who 
[01:59:30]  we were.  This is a, this is a big day.  Yeah.  As much as it's kind of douchey to hear the different voice and stuff, but this took fucking  balls, man.  Holy fuck.  What dopes they were to pull you off the air for the marathon.  What dummies.  For everything.  It was just so stupid.  Cowards.  I mean, that one, you know, they never should have, they should not have fired you for  that.  You made sure you got suspended.  They should not have fired you for that.  It would have went away.  They should have tried to hang in there because we were, we were really important to the station 
[02:00:00]  back then.  It always goes away.  It does.  We've learned that over the years, right?  This is almost done.  Let's hear the rest of this.  Oh, there.  Now it's all out.  Now it's all out in the breeze.  Now it's all out in the breeze.  Now you guys know what's been going on the last four days here at AF.  I appreciate if you pass it on to others because we're not going to be able to have  this spiel again for at least three weeks.  Maybe, maybe ever.  We might be out of here for good now.  That's it.  That's it.  Who knows?  Who knows what's going to happen?  We will see.  But that's the form of censorship and I can't accept that. 
[02:00:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's it.  And, and, you know, we're going to be suspended for at least two weeks without pay.  Right.  I don't make a lot of money.  Trust me.  This is serious business.  I can't afford to be off for two weeks.  That got remedied, right?  That's right.  To prove my point that no one should be censored in this damn country.  All right.  And the other thing real fast about WoW.  We didn't break any broadcasting laws.  No.  Now, one law was broken, you know, broadcast law.  No.  I don't think there's any law about telling people to put a word on their car. 
[02:01:00]  Right.  And have the girls voluntary flash them.  But whatever.  So I want you guys to know that.  We didn't break one broadcasting law, but we were censored and I can't, I can't accept  that.  No.  So there you go.  That's it.  We'll see you on the July.  End of July, maybe.  Maybe.  Who knows how this is going to play out, but I totally would appreciate it if you guys  passed the word along for us, because honestly, we will not be here tomorrow.  All right?  It's been real, man.  The music.  And then the music, of course. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, we didn't say the call letters there.  Oh, man.  And I bet you this is how it went down after that.  My memory is not strong as far as this one goes, but I bet you what happened, Dave now  comes in, yells and screams at us.  Oh, yeah.  And suspends us immediately.  And then he probably went to Bruce Mittman like, well, now we got to fire these guys.  Because I think that's what he wanted.  Oh, yeah.  He did not like that.  I think he wanted us fired in the end and wanted to bring in guys he could completely 
[02:02:00]  control.  Dave, what are you, an asshole?  Get out of my fucking office with that.  With that boring, I'm from Lincoln, Nebraska type radio.  And I guarantee Bruce then stepped in and said, hell no.  And Bruce was like, don't worry, boys, we'll pay you.  And then Bruce dragged us into his meeting, into his office for a meeting, closed the door,  and then was a completely different person.  Of course.  And he probably sat us down like, look, you know.  He undermined Dave, or actually overmined him because he was the GM, Dave, all the time 
[02:02:30]  when it came to us.  And he probably said, look, this is a real issue.  We're a little nervous advertising-wise and stuff.  So, of course, we're not going to fire you, but we do have to take you off the air for  a little while.  Go on vacation.  I kind of remember that.  And he goes, and don't you worry, we'll pay you.  Yeah, we'll pay you.  So just take a vacation.  Right.  So in the end, we got two weeks off to do nothing.  Except film two-sheet videos.  Film dumb fucking videos on the beach. 
[02:03:00]  That's fucked up.  That was a big day, man.  If you care about the history of this show, that's a big fucking day.  Because we just honestly had no idea how it was going to turn out.  Because that city was, like, on our ass.  That was the day I invented the flux capacitor.  Right.  Let's say hi to Scott in Chicago.  Scott.  Hey, Elf.  How you doing?  Hey, buddy.  I was listening to the, you know, you guys playing this, and I wondered, this is you 
[02:03:30]  ranting and Anthony reacting.  Right.  When did the shift in your, you know, broadcast career come where Anthony became the ranter  and you kind of reacted to him?  It went both ways.  That was just an example of where, you know, both was going off.  But it was mostly radio rants, because I just knew how this business should be run.  This business has frustrated me since I first turned on a microphone.  No joke.  All the way back in college, I saw the douchebags that ran the college radio station and how they 
[02:04:00]  were just full of themselves and didn't really understand, you know, what this thing could  do.  And I had to change, because I was starting to sound like a broken record with my rants.  They'd be on the air if they were any good.  I can rant today about this place easily, but we did a little bit yesterday.  Now we do it just in smaller doses.  Right.  But I think a lot of the audience was right when they were hearing the same shit over and  over again.  It gets to be enough. 
[02:04:30]  Well, it's really fun to hear a 14-year-old.  You're really...  I know.  I don't know what that is.  I feel like it's the processing or something.  I don't know.  God, did I really sound that young?  That was pretty funny.  In the last clip, Opie was going to say either graciously or gracefully, but then he stopped  himself.  I was like...  I was speaking extremely fast. 
[02:05:00]  I don't know what I was trying to say there.  He wants to know, what were you trying to say there?  I don't know.  It was 17 years ago.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Let me think.  Oh, now I remember.  I was trying to say...  I got a few words wrong in there, but I got my point across.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There was a dude on Modern Marvel's wearing a WOW shirt.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  The WOW sticker was in The Sopranos.  It was in a bunch of Dennis Leary's TV shows.  Yeah, it's popped up.  And this Dave Douglas didn't get what it was.  Oh, and I remember now the article, they were trying to claim that women were being harassed. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  And they just weren't.  Wasn't happening.  Was there one or two that could have possibly been harassed?  Maybe.  Maybe.  But she made it sound like it was this epidemic that women were being followed.  Remember?  I'm starting to remember.  Followed and stalked.  Yeah, they were being followed and stalked.  They were being followed home.  And that just wasn't happening on a...  That's the article, huh?  What does it say in there?  Yeah, it's a long article.  It was a big one.  Like, wow.  No, not a bit.  Read the first couple... 
[02:06:00]  Well, it's 1997.  In Lowell, the financially troubled Prince Pasta Factory is up for sale.  Well, and in Worcester, Wednesdays are in even more trouble than that.  At WAF FM radio, midweek now means wow.  Whip them out Wednesday.  The station that bills itself as radio that really rocks.  Oh, yeah.  In quotes, by the way.  The station encourages men to place wow signs in their car windows, urging women to show 
[02:06:30]  them their breasts.  Thank you.  All that's doing is making guys want to hear the radio show.  Right?  Right.  So why not talk about it?  It worked.  Dumb woman.  Keep going.  Oh, big mention.  This sophomoric stunt is the brainchild of two witless disc jockeys.  Who are they?  Opie and Anthony.  Wait, that's us!  Who spend the evening drive time regaling listeners with memories of such developmental  milestones as their first erections on the school bus. 
[02:07:00]  You gotta write that in the Boston Globe.  What an old lady.  What a fucking old lady.  That's Anthony with the school bus.  I did get boners on the bus.  Because it vibrators from the...  No, it had nothing to do with a feeling of any sort.  It wasn't the vibration.  It wasn't anything.  I would get on the bus, sit there, and get a rod.  Yeah.  And then I'd have to take my books and hide it when I got off the bus.  And then once I got off the bus, it went away.  Why were you getting rods? 
[02:07:30]  I don't know.  It was some kind of thing I never understood.  Psychological thing.  Yeah, because it had nothing to do with a physical...  I always thought it was the school buses.  It was no physical stimulation.  No vibrations going.  It wasn't a physical stimulation.  It wasn't me looking around at a girl that was attractive.  I just got a rod on the bus, and then it went away when I got off the bus.  I don't know what happened.  Let me...  I want to read more of this article, Sam.  It's going well so far.  Let's say hi to Chris in L.A.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hi. 
[02:08:00]  I have a...  You were talking about being censored on The Boston Show, if I'm correct.  This...  Without you...  Without you guys making all this pretty much whipping out windows and everything,  you wouldn't be here where you are.  The thing that they censored is bullshit.  Because the censoring, it's like you can't even do anything.  Like, no one can do anything on the radio nowadays.  Like, how you guys were talking about, we can't make prank calls.  And I've heard some of the stuff that you guys did when you did prank calls, which is the funniest shit I have ever heard in my life. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, they took prank calls away from us.  God, that's got to be almost 10 years ago now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You cannot do a prank call on the radio.  Every single one of those you hear is fake in some way.  They got to fake.  But those I almost understand, because you can get sued if somebody says...  Like, but this other stuff is just reasonless.  We can't really have naked girls on anymore, or we can, but we can't really touch them, or we can't...  There's no...  Jack off on them.  Exactly, while they're crying.  We used to have girls squirt into Big A's face. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, it was great.  You absolutely could not do that on the radio nowadays.  No, Big A would sue.  Exactly.  They took away a lot of our tricks over the years.  And the only thing that I feel would have to be pretty much censored, it's pretty much  the bit you guys did with the April Fool's joke, because that was the worst thing I've  ever heard.  It's like when you guys did a Scott and Todd job over, that was like the agonizing shit  ever, because it's like, come on, finish it.  Just finish it. 
[02:09:30]  I hear him talking.  I don't know what...  I don't know what he's saying.  I don't know.  It's...  All right.  Thank you, sir.  What are you saying?  Thank you, Chris.  I continue with the Boston Globe Bar, I call them.  We were up to the point of erections on the school bus.  Yes.  Their prepubescent...  Oh, no.  Their pubescent preoccupation with bodily functions from the bathroom to the bedroom puts them  in the mainstream of standard FM radio fare.  Oh, boy.  But look, this is just...  She's a hack old lady.  Yes, she is. 
[02:10:00]  She's saying hack old lady things.  Yeah, she's not our audience, obviously.  Like, what's wrong with having a sophomoric sense of humor?  Like, why is that so terrible?  Right.  This is an era, after all, when Howard Stern claims to be the king of all media, and Time  Magazine cites Don Imus as one of the 25 most influential Americans.  Wow.  Okay.  The First Amendment casts a long shadow of necessity.  It protects the lowest common denominator.  And there is much to be said for the argument that women can turn off programs that offend 
[02:10:30]  us.  But women should not have to turn off the highway to elude the leering pursuit of morons in the  adjacent lane.  Leering pursuit.  Right, because that's what makes guys look at women.  A bumper sticker.  A bumper sticker.  It's not...  See, it was the other way around.  It's...  It's...  They put the sticker on, or a sign in the window, and then the woman has to make the  move.  So she would be into it.  The guy just drives.  She's trying to claim like that.  I know, but it never happened.  Yeah, now you're going to, like, pressure her into showing her bros.  Yeah, like, what do you... 
[02:11:00]  Like, it's like getting a girl, like, running around the park for Erin.  Oh.  I like that one.  That was a good one.  I did, too.  I'm saying, but I'm kind of backing her point up.  But you did.  Well, I understand that one might have been a little wrong.  But we had someone that was going to do it.  I know.  I dated her.  Yeah.  We were...  We've got to say it now.  It was a girl, Jimmy, who was dating her.  No.  I met her that because of the show.  Before you were dating her.  Oh, that's why I met her.  Right.  We love this girl, man.  I used to love running into Jimmy and her because she was just fucking nuts. 
[02:11:30]  That's shit crazy.  But it was...  Can you tell one of the old stories from her?  How she would always...  Well, let me say how I met her was I'd run around the park for Erin, which is, you know,  rape, run around the park for Erin.  You're supposed to meet a girl.  Right.  Well, basically, we...  Yeah.  It was called Run Around Park for Erin, and we had this...  Was that her real name or forget it?  No.  It wasn't.  Okay, yeah.  But we needed the girl to be...  Her real name was Mike.  And we were going to set her loose in Central Park. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  Look, I'm not saying that.  Sometimes they're right.  And she was going to have, like, something on her, like, you know, flag football type of  thing.  And she was going to run around Central Park.  And if you found her and grabbed that, you know, that flag off her body, you were going  to win, like, a lot.  Yeah.  Like, we were looking for a huge prize for this.  Yeah, nothing...  You weren't supposed to hurt her.  It was just...  No.  But they figured out what Run Around Park for Erin.  And it was supposed to be some kind of a pseudo-pursuit of a girl in Central Park, and it had all 
[02:12:30]  kinds of nasty, rapey...  Undertones.  Undertones to it, yeah.  We were shut down on that one.  Yeah.  I think I sort of understood that one.  I kind of understood that one.  I was driving around.  I kind of understood that one.  But anyway, because of that, the girl came in who was more than willing to do this, and  then Jimmy ends up dating her.  I was driving around one day, and I hear you guys going, Jim Norton, if you're listening,  come into the radio show.  We have a girl for you.  That was how I met her.  Really?  Yeah, you on the air said, come in today. 
[02:13:00]  Really?  Yeah, this is before I was in...  I was a regular, but I wasn't in every day.  And I came in, and she was into being slapped.  That was her thing.  So you're like, would you slap her on the air?  And I'm like, yeah.  And she was into it, and I fucking slapped her in the face on the radio, and she liked  it.  She was really dirty.  I remember this like it was yesterday, by the way.  And I think we started talking after, and I offered to drive her home.  I was living in Jersey at the time.  So I dropped her off.  She was on the east side.  And I don't know if we fooled around that night, but I think I got her number. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, she wouldn't show me where her apartment really was.  She made me drop her on the corner.  And we stayed in touch.  And she was sexy, and I couldn't believe she went out with me.  I could not believe it.  She was really sexy.  I picked her up, and she had like a fucking...  This time I knew there was a problem.  She had like a water bottle, but it was filled with like fucking Zinfandel or whatever.  She was just drinking wine in my car.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Out of a water bottle.  Yeah.  But we'd be...  She's still a friend of mine.  I haven't talked to her in a while.  Yeah.  But like we would go to restaurants, and she had a fork, but she had to turn them upside 
[02:14:00]  down because she was afraid that the forked tongs were coming at her eyes.  At her eyes.  Didn't we all go to dinner once at some place?  Oh, yeah, man.  We all hung out at her.  A bunch of times.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  I don't remember where it was.  Yeah, I remember that.  She was really good at yoga, too.  She didn't want the forked tongs facing her eyes.  What about the X she had?  Didn't she stick, like, a TV antenna up his ass or something?  Oh, did she?  Maybe she did, yeah.  I think she did toss that one.  I don't remember.  And smashed the guy's really nice TV at the time.  Probably, yeah.  Oh, she was nuts. 
[02:14:30]  That's crazy.  She could tell a good story.  All right.  Continue there, Sam Roberts.  Certainly, even the giant intellects at WAF-FM must know they work at a third-rate station  in a second-rate market, and that not every radio in every car is tuned in to its daily  diet of Jimi Hendrix and ZZ Top.  We never played Jimi Hendrix and ZZ Top back then.  That was classic.  I hear they play that stuff now, but, you know, the times have changed. 
[02:15:00]  But we never played any of that stuff.  Why would we assume that everyone was listening?  Right.  We knew they weren't.  You know what happens when you assume?  Yes.  They come on your shoes.  One woman thought the letters mistakenly had been inverted and should have read Mom.  Aw.  Another speculated that the letters stood for Women of Wisdom.  Ew.  Cock-eyed optimism.  Cock.  She just made those up.  She told her made it up.  She made those up for her article. 
[02:15:30]  No woman thought that.  No one did.  No.  We've heard the mom joke over the years.  Women of Wisdom.  God.  Women offended by or unaware of the meaning of WOW report being cut off in traffic and  nearly driven off the road for failing to comply with the displayed demand.  Failing to comply.  State police responded to complaints this week by ordering the station to stop promoting  WOW, citing the obvious public safety hazard.  It's not a hazard.  No.  No.  And did that happen, what you said in the article? 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  It certainly wasn't happening.  No.  Not in any widespread number that anyone should give a shit.  And the reason the state police got involved, this is just amazing to me.  Yeah, I remember that.  It was because of that asshole of a reporter.  Yeah, the reporter.  That fucked us over, too.  God comes in with an...  We've told these stories, I understand, but...  I don't know.  Going down memory lane today.  But we had...  It was the local Fox guy, I think?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was doing a story on... 
[02:16:30]  Comes in with jeans and a hip shirt and an earring.  Hey, this is great, man.  And he's like, this is the coolest thing ever, man.  And he got us talking.  He was smart.  We weren't media savvy back then.  Not at all.  We're like, oh, I remember going to you like, I think they're going to do a positive article.  Wow, this is great.  And he got us talking, because, you know, he got us...  Video, got us talking, and then the story runs.  Was it a good story?  And there he is.  It's like, where's the guy with the shirt and the earring?  He's in a suit, no earring. 
[02:17:00]  No earring.  Reporter hair.  Over a highway, I think.  The dangers of this promotion are outrageous.  We talked with state police, and there's a cop who's talking to him.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Where's the guy with the earring?  We actually got a girl to give him a lap dance that day.  What happened?  Remember?  He took the lap dance.  Fuck yeah.  Where's the guy with the earring?  Because back then we were still having parties.  Where's the cool guy?  Can you find the wow piece now?  Read the rest of the Boston Globe article, and then maybe we can find the wow report. 
[02:17:30]  But instead of abandoning their adolescent promotion, Opie and Anthony have spent the last few days  polluting the airwaves with attacks on their female critics.  Your airwaves are so polluted.  I can't even get that show, man.  All very thoughtful, of course.  On the order of the caller who boasted that he has placed a new sign alongside wow that reads, 
[02:18:00]  Now sucks.  National Organization of Women.  That's what now represents.  Oh, here comes the Dave Douglas stuff.  Oh, boy.  Oh, goody.  Dave Douglas is the program manager at WAAF.  He says wow began this spring as a lighthearted fun concept that is growing beyond what we expected.  This is why I hate them all in radio.  Lighthearted fun.  Lighthearted fun.  We're all about lighthearted fun here. 
[02:18:30]  Lighthearted fun concept.  Dick.  What a groveling behind-the-scenes worm.  He acknowledges that the campaign has gotten out of hand and offended some people, but that's not what our intention was.  No.  The road to hell, Mr. Douglas.  Oh, shit.  Paid with good intentions?  No, no, no, no.  What happened?  What is it?  I-90.  Oh, okay.  I thought.  Southbound.  Of course.  He attributes the criticism to the puritanical nature of this region. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, there you go.  Rather than to any debasement of women inherent in the wow concept.  Some women, after all, have chosen to bare their breasts, he notes.  Some?  Plenty.  Some?  Especially when this first hit?  You Massachusetts whores were fucking flipping your tits out like crazy.  Dirtiest girls ever are Boston.  Some?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  If a girl's wearing a crucifix from Boston, she'll blow you and then put it in your hiney.  Too late. 
[02:19:30]  The station is concerned.  Yeah?  But will not order Opie and Anthony to stop promoting wow, says Douglas.  That would infringe on the creative control.  Ah, well, that went to the fucking wayside.  See, he-  Of the station's two artists.  You just heard our audio, right?  You see what this guy did?  Yeah.  Liar.  We're not going to tell him to stop, but then he did exactly that.  Exactly that.  With a secret memo we weren't supposed to read on the air. 
[02:20:00]  Probably because he- I'll tell you why.  Because he probably knew it would contradict him in the fucking Boston article.  Uh-huh.  Really?  He said that about two shock jocks who began their program yesterday announcing that once  again it was F.U.  Friday.  That's where F.U.  Friday started all the way back then?  Wow.  The management of W.A.  That's why we're doing F.U.  Friday.  Yeah, people get a chance to advance.  It's the wrong attitude, Al.  It's the wrong attitude.  Everyone has, you know, shit they want to get off their chest after a long week. 
[02:20:30]  The management of W.A.A.F. will reduce the visibility of wow, but Douglas acknowledges  that regardless of what we do, people will continue to do this.  All right.  Doesn't sound that bad there.  W.A.A.F. ought to give some thought to the ages of those people.  One woman reports being shouted at on the Mass Pike by a school bus full of boys no older  than 12 holding handmade wow signs. 
[02:21:00]  I would bet a lot of money that did not happen.  Just stop it.  Go ahead.  Another report seeing two 10-year-olds holding a wow sign on an overpass above I-95.  First of all, who is reporting to her?  Like, why would they go to her with any of these stories?  She's just trying to pump up her story.  Of course she is.  How do you know how old they are?  Who stopped and asked them their ages?  You're just guessing.  Because she made it all up to make her point better.  It's probably one 20-year-old. 
[02:21:30]  She's just cutting half of the story.  Like, she didn't say, hey, I'm doing a wow story.  She didn't write in the paper, hey, I'm doing a wow story.  If you have horrible stories of what happened to you, please let me know.  Like, people just volunteered.  And contacted her?  And contacted her out of nowhere.  It didn't happen.  That's lies.  Bullshit.  But you read that, it sounds pretty bad, right?  It's the foot.  I figured it out.  No way.  Yep.  No.  Look for yourself.  Foot.  No.  Yep.  See?  That might be right. 
[02:22:00]  It's the foot.  No.  Continue.  I'm staying right here.  That was my first guess, but it's the foot.  No.  Why would it go up that high?  Boom.  Boom.  Left.  Foot.  Boom.  All right, continue.  Continue.  Rock and roll, like adolescence, is about rebellion.  Nice.  Right?  Uh-oh.  Oh, here we go.  That's why Opie and Anthony court parody by calling each other dude on the air.  All right, she's on to us.  She's finally right. 
[02:22:30]  She's on to us.  All right, she made one good point.  As if they were 15-year-old boys instead of middle-aged men.  You can't sue her for slender.  Damn, the old broad's on to us.  She's on to us on that one.  All right.  15-year-old boys.  Yeah, one point for you.  Middle-aged, though?  Oh, well.  Please pour the empties.  Go ahead.  Come on.  Check out the empties, man.  But rebellion is one thing. 
[02:23:00]  Misogyny is another.  I love a good misogyny.  The days of Neanderthals, big clubs, are over.  Marianne Winters, the director of the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault, wrote to WAAF this week.  Not so, Mrs. Winters.  You fuck her?  And these days, the Neanderthals are calling themselves artists.  And they have creative control.  Nice.  Look out.  Is that the end of the article?  That's the end. 
[02:23:30]  Touché.  Artist.  And we have creative control.  You sound like a Neanderthal.  I know.  Show me your tits.  Did you find the news report to really wrap this whole thing apart?  No, I was reading the words.  Together, I mean.  Wrap this apart.  I mean, don't we have other people that could be looking for this stuff?  You really think.  Did E-Rock find it?  What is E-Rock doing today?  Eating?  Bikini Girls?  Yeah, he's checking out Bikini Girls.  Is it fan fiction?  WWE fan fiction? 
[02:24:00]  Right in this movie?  Put Wow News or something.  I don't know.  Put it out.  Have you seen it before?  Is it out?  I think I have seen that one before, yeah.  That movie's got to be three years in the making now.  Right?  The E-Rock movie?  E-Rock's fucking period piece of 20, fucking 30, 50 years.  NBC.  Wow.  What's that one?  That's one of my favorite E-Rock moments.  What is this one?  Who is that?  Karen Allen Riddle?  The mayor here was not called until after 10.  However, a spokesperson says they will make an effort to contact the mayor here more quickly 
[02:24:30]  should there be any future incidents.  We are live in Buchanan this evening.  Carol Ann Riddell.  Where's Buchanan?  I don't know.  Our assault on the media was one of the greatest things.  Oh, was that a good one.  Oh, we've got to bring that back.  That was a dandy.  If it happens to come back on its own, so be it.  Right in.  Right?  It's not us.  Who are we to say not to do that?  Don't infringe on our freedom of expression.  We're entertainers. 
[02:25:00]  Talent.  That was great.  If you could find the news report, that would be wonderful.  I forgot what his name was.  That guy got us bad.  Oh, did he get us bad?  We were bamboozled by him.  He was supposed to be a cool guy.  Right.  We were tricked by the earring.  That earring was really tricky.  Probably didn't even have a hole in his ear.  Clip on.  It was probably a clip on.  He's probably used that gag so many times to fuck people over. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, he probably thought, oh, these dopes will fall for this.  Yeah.  Fuck.  And we did.  Remember, he's like, hey, get up on the rock bus.  Remember all that shit?  Get up on top of the rock bus.  With some of the girls, you know?  The girls up there.  That would be a cool shot.  Remember all that crap?  And then he was like, just fucking in a suit and tie, and he was angry.  Over the highway.  With a state trooper right next to him, over the highway.  We're like, what?  I remember seeing that going, when did he film that part?  Where's the cool guy?  Where's all that cool stuff he filmed? 
[02:26:00]  He didn't use any of it.  None of it.  God, I need to see that now.  Yeah.  Could you have Iraq look deep for that?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  Yeah.  It'll be somewhere.  It's the internet.  That's right.  I really did.  Siding somewhere.  I did have quite a bomb.  You did?  Why?  Yeah.  Missed it.  What did you say?  That you were talking about two 10-year-olds.  And I said, maybe it was just one 20-year-old she cut in half of the story.  See, that would be two 10-year-olds.  Yeah, that was a bum, all right. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Righty.  Get into some other stuff.  Righty.  Jimmy, you want to repeat what you said to me?  About what?  Oh, this is a cool song.  This is the song you came out of in that clip.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Good.  What is it? 
[02:27:00]  I don't really remember this.  This is Jenny Says, like, cowboy man.  How old?  How old?  97.  Yeah, I like this one.  Oh, I remember this.  Yeah, of course.  We used to really, really like the music AF played, remember?  We were really into it.  Except BAB, I was playing classic rock, and that's where I met Ant.  And then to be able to play all the new stuff?  Yeah, it was really good. 
[02:27:30]  That was awesome.  I never heard this.  It's a good song.  It's so 90s.  Does it have that feel?  Man, it certainly does.  What's the band?  Jenny Says.  No, that's the song, Cowboy Mouth.  Oh, Cowboy Mouth, sorry.  Cowboy what?  Mouth.  Mouth.  That's a very Seven Mary Three feel.  Seven Mary Three.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How come I never heard of this guy's good? 
[02:28:00]  What is the only good song?  One hit wonder back in the 90s.  Was this a hit?  Yeah, it was barely a hit.  I don't remember this in New York.  This is just kind of a filler song in between the popular songs of the 90s. 
[02:28:30]  But that was the cool thing about it.  We got to play a lot of songs that most of radio was ignoring.  Yeah.  Because it wasn't a huge hit or whatever.  Anyway.  Oh.  Do we have WoW stickers still?  So how do they get them?  Because a lot of people have been asking for them lately.  And now it's just become a way to show that you listen to the show.  Yeah, it's like a show sticker now.  And if it still works, great.  I don't know. 
[02:29:00]  God bless.  People can send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Do we have a lot of them still?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Who's that?  Oh, no.  Fun killer.  Fun killer.  I don't know.  Who are you?  Exactly.  Looks like Miss Hathaway from fucking Beverly Hills.  Foghorn Leghorn's nephew.  What are you going to do?  What does that mean?  She's got creds. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Kenny's laughing over there because he could hear us.  Tell Kenny to come in.  Come in here.  Kenny loves some inter-fucking office gossip.  He loves it.  Kenny, be careful because who is that?  Oh, you're closing the door tight.  Who is that?  I don't know, but she's not happy.  With who?  She's having technical difficulties the last two days with her studio.  Oh, so that had nothing to do with us. 
[02:30:00]  No, no, no.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  That's all we care about.  We were worried that she was like a human resources lady.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  She has that look.  I don't know what she is, but.  I have a word for it.  I can guess what channel she's on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  W-C-N-T.  Right.  Wow.  All right.  What?  For WoW stickers, why don't you guys tweet this out on the O&A show Twitter,  which is O&A show. 
[02:30:30]  So to get a WoW sticker, you do what?  You can mail a self-addressed and stamped envelope to 1221 Avenue of the Americas,  floor 36, New York, New York, 10020,  and make sure it says Opie and Anthony WoW sticker request.  We haven't advertised that in a while.  Maybe we should get a promo.  Yeah.  You know what I love about what just happened?  We just made your job a lot tougher.  You got a stuff envelope.  Come on.  We still get them, you know.  Well, now you're going to get a lot of them.  Good.  You're going to get a lot of them. 
[02:31:00]  You're going to promote the WoW brand, right?  I took a dump before, and it was awful.  How was it?  Awful.  It was like a real force.  I was on the handicap thing, so I'm tippy-toe pushing.  Oh, you had a high boy.  And I couldn't.  I went, but not much.  And it was like one of those endless wipers.  I was eight wipes in, and I realized I haven't even made a dent in this thing.  Oh, God.  Is there anything worse, though?  Oh, it's terrible.  I described that as wearing down a crayon to keep wiping.  Yes.  Right, right.  It's just a crayon. 
[02:31:30]  Fuck, yeah.  What?  Who?  This girl I walked by.  I had a nice one, too.  Yeah.  My smoothies, man.  They help, right?  Oh, very.  They come out like they go in.  Yeah.  Very, right.  Very smooth.  I told you.  They get a little pot-roasty at times, but besides that, they're coming out every day, though.  That's nice.  My drink has been making it hard.  I'm liquefying rice and drinking it.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  And the paper today is calling the NutriBullet kind of hack. 
[02:32:00]  How is that a hack?  How is there a hacky?  Yeah, what's a hack aspect to that?  Exactly.  You only get it with airplane snacks.  The NutriBullet is taking off.  We all know that.  They see it as another infomercial type just gimmick.  How they said it, I'm trying to...  I never know what paper this stuff is in.  Can you give me...  Does it have OxyClean in it?  Can I have your post? 
[02:32:30]  I think it's in the post.  Please.  Grab my post?  Yeah, please.  Please.  Oh, the post.  I need to grab your post.  Here we go.  Jenny says...  I know.  That's stuck in my head now.  I might do some 90s music.  Download that.  As I try to get this pile of shit back in shape.  Pile of shit.  There you go.  This mountain of flesh shit back in shape. 
[02:33:00]  It says fashionable New Yorkers are falling hard for cheesy.  That's what I...  Okay.  Cheesy as seen on TV health gadget.  They're calling the NutriBullet a cheesy as seen on TV health gadget.  That is beyond not fair.  It would imply that it doesn't work.  The NutriBullet is amazing.  Pull that quote.  Well, it pains me to say it because I still haven't got my envelope.  But it's an amazing, an amazing product.  I'm all in with blending shit up now because of the NutriBullet. 
[02:33:30]  Because you don't have to clean the blades like the old days where you had to put your whole hand in there and try to clean out those blades.  Get under the blades.  It's impossible.  The blade is like a lid.  The blade is a lid.  Yeah.  You know, a lid with the blades in the middle of it.  Yeah, and the screw off top on the bottom instead of the top.  So...  And you run the damn blade under the water for maybe 15 seconds.  And I'm telling you, that's it.  That cleanup is done.  And then you take what you...  You take the container that you just blended everything in as your drinking container. 
[02:34:00]  That's...  It's a piece of cake.  The old days you had to take the blender, find something, pour it into that.  So now it's more of a mess.  Oh, my God.  But for them to call it a cheesy, has-seen-on-TV health gadget, that's just wrong.  Why are they calling it that?  What are they saying?  I don't know.  Are they saying anything?  I didn't really read the article.  It says...  That's all I need to know.  Because they say that it blends things up, and it does.  So, what's the fucking problem?  I don't get it. 
[02:34:30]  In the stylus kitchen of Michael Kirschbommer.  Oh.  In his midtown apartment.  People of Kirschbommer hate him.  Let's see.  Okay.  This guy doesn't like it.  He says, personally, it'd be cool if it were more mid-century, more classic-looking.  What?  What are you talking...  What was this written by?  Fucking Dr. Ian Smith?  With his archaic blender?  Eh, whatever. 
[02:35:00]  I was just amazed they called it cheesy, because it's certainly not cheesy.  Yeah, but it's a very long article, like, talking about how great it is, actually.  Oh, it does?  Yeah, like, everybody that they're quoted...  So, why would they start off by calling it the cheesy-ass-seen-on-TV health gadget?  They're confused.  Yeah, I mean, they're not style-conscious New Yorkers like yourself.  Ah, I see.  I have a lot of style.  Maybe that's it.  Yeah, it says, after you realize how easy it is, she says, you definitely don't care  that it's sold on TV.  But they fucked him in the headline. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  It's all about the headline.  We don't write the headline.  Whatever.  Remember those people that used to write stories about us, and we'd be like, what the fuck  is with the headline?  They're like, no, we just write the article.  We don't write the headline.  Who writes the headline?  Oh, there's a staff.  And again, it got all vague.  Yeah, no one submits it.  It's like, the headline's probably the most important part of the story, because that's what  people see.  And they throw it away.  Oh, yeah.  We don't write the headline.  What?  How about you fucking...  They call us opiate dopey.  Do you understand that? 
[02:36:00]  It's crazy.  It's hilarious.  No, it's not.  It is.  It's not hilarious at all.  I'm offended.  I am offended.  My goddamn sleep schedule is so wacky now.  Why?  I don't know.  I get home now, and I just fucking, like...  Wait, you're back rubbed?  Sleep.  Work out.  And then go to sleep for hours.  I woke up yesterday at 11 p.m.  How about you dozed off?  I dozed off at about 4 p.m. 
[02:36:30]  You could take a seven-hour nap?  Dude, I was on the couch just fucking snoozing away.  And then I woke up at 11.  I stayed up until about 2.  Right.  Went back to sleep.  And then fucking woke up for the show.  Oh, wow.  I did nothing.  I know it is.  It feels good.  You're old.  Oh, maybe that's it.  I'm taking naps.  Hey, I'll stay out all goddamn night.  But if I'm home, and, like...  Especially if I'm home with, like, no company over or anything. 
[02:37:00]  It's just me and the little beeve.  I fucking crap right out.  Nothing better than those all-day naps on a couch with some dumb TV movie on.  That's it.  Where you pop your head up, and you just...  You feel like you're in a womb.  Everything is just warm and fuzzy.  Yeah.  Smell of vaginas in the air.  You just keep going back to sleep, and it's a deep, deep sleep, and you wake up a little  bit, and then you go back.  When you fall asleep, when, I think it's AMC or something, is playing, or USA does it, 
[02:37:30]  and they're playing a movie, and then the same movie plays right after the movie, and  then the same movie plays right after that, and you're sleeping for hours on end, you'll  wake up and be like, now it's the middle of the movie, and then you wake up again,  and it's the beginning.  Yeah.  It's so confusing.  And sometimes I'll wake up and go like, I gotta go to work, because it's five in the  afternoon.  Sure.  But I think it's five in the morning, and I'm like, I got, oh, I got back to sleep again. 
[02:38:00]  Very snoozy.  That's Donnie Don Wicklin.  What's in the bag?  What's in the bag?  Are they donuts?  Fuck you.  Did he bring donuts?  Donnie Wicklin, you bring some donuts?  No.  See, this is why we like you.  You can take a good ribbing, unlike the old guys.  You brought cupcakes, did you?  I did.  Oh, nice.  Cupcakes.  What kind of cupcakes?  They look like some of them gourmet cupcakes.  Were you really trying to get celebrities to bring us a cupcake during the unmasked? 
[02:38:30]  I was expecting some Drake's Yankee Doodles.  That's like the stupidest idea ever.  I can't, but thank you.  I would love to, but I can't.  You hate them.  I love cupcakes.  I was kidding.  A magnolia cupcake?  I like cupcakes.  Yeah, sure.  I like cupcakes.  It's your nickname.  What is this?  I don't know.  They all look so delicious.  What's a good flavor?  Magnolia's is...  I'm taking the light one.  Yes.  That's right.  It's a cum flavor.  You took the red velvet.  Oh, come here, Jim.  Splash on my back. 
[02:39:00]  Two game joke follies.  Back and forth that we both secretly mean.  I'm just cutting it over.  You took the red velvet.  I was only cutting this.  They're known for their red velvet over there.  Oh, that is a red velvet.  I cut a little piece off.  I didn't touch it.  No, no, that's what I want.  I cut a little piece off my knife.  This mush will not accept a cupcake right now.  Oh, I'm going to use a knife.  You think this body's going to put itself back together?  But I didn't touch it with my finger.  That's still very edible.  Thank you anyway, Don.  Holy fuck.  That is a tasty cupcake. 
[02:39:30]  They do a very good job.  How do you keep your fucking great body?  I work out like a maniac.  I meant Opie.  Oh.  I do like that.  I'm getting there.  Yeah.  I'm getting it back together.  Just the fact that Ant is eating this like he's the fucking bell of the ball.  He's holding the cupcake.  And he's shaving it off.  Why do you eat cupcakes like that?  What do you use?  Your hands?  Yeah.  Why do you do that?  Exactly.  It's like you're fucking eating an apple.  I, I, because.  Is this a Seinfeld thing? 
[02:40:00]  No.  I hate taking a bite.  That was, though.  Oh.  And getting it all over your hands.  All over your lips and stuff.  Yeah.  I don't like cream all over my lips.  Of course not.  You feel like you're wasting it.  Belongs in your asshole.  Again, here, Jim.  Don, who came up with the cupcake idea?  Come on.  Come on, Don.  Yeah, come on.  It's all right.  We're not going to say anything.  It's about a week ago. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I thought it'd be my, a cool idea to have celebrities maybe walk by, give you a cupcake during the  unmasked.  Is that really your idea?  Or are you just taking the ball for someone?  It's mine.  You're a good man.  However, I'm checking that off the list of things not to do.  We didn't care for the idea, but it is fun that you come on and admit it.  Yeah.  The other guys before you hated us even talking about them. 
[02:41:00]  I didn't care.  Holy fuck.  Isn't it good?  Another?  That's crazy.  Have another one.  Only one.  What flavor are you eating?  I don't know.  I had the cream.  That was red velvet with white, just your standard vanilla icing on top.  I'm telling you.  It was so fucking good.  Magnolia.  They're the best.  I'm literally watching you eat a cupcake and just asking you, like, I'm living through  you.  It's so good.  Wow, that was good.  God, I want one right now.  Just have one.  Work it off.  Today's workout day.  It is.  My trainer's going to be like, what'd you eat today? 
[02:41:30]  Um, nothing.  I have something.  I have a Quest bar coming, which is not as good as a cupcake, but it's actually not  that bad.  I can tolerate that.  I mean, it goes with a cupcake.  No, but I mean, still, for a fucking no sugar bar or a little teeny bit of sugar, it's actually  really good.  That one cupcake would go to my shit gut.  You think that cupcake had a little sugar in it?  A little bit.  Yeah, it definitely did.  A lot of it.  They're good.  I'll just go to the bathroom and vomit. 
[02:42:00]  Bulimic.  Like an opus old chick.  I had a couple bulimia chicks.  The Red Lobster story is a big one, too.  I didn't understand bulimia back then.  And then I had the one that got really...  Did she puke at the Red Lobster?  Yeah, I told that story.  She was thin and I had no money.  I was at Geneseo and I drove her home to Syracuse, where she was from, for one of the breaks.  And decided to go to Red Lobster and spent everything I had, because I liked her at the time.  Uh-huh.  Everything.  I was broke by the end of my meal with her. 
[02:42:30]  And she said, I'll be right back.  We feasted.  We had a good time.  We feasted.  She went into the bathroom and puked.  She came out.  Her eyes were all watery still.  Oh.  Why are you laughing?  George Costanza, too.  He had these stories this morning.  Aren't they great?  I love them.  But the best one...  I love them.  The best one, I was a freshman in college and I brought this girl back to my room after  drinking, thinking we were going to fool around a little bit.  And she insisted on ordering a pizza. 
[02:43:00]  And I was too young to understand any of this stuff.  But I remember thinking it was weird.  Why now?  Like, I think we even ate on the way home probably.  We were going out with E-Rock Ella?  It certainly is.  The unshaven fucking mokes.  He doth lumber.  And she was in good shape.  Nothing was water. 
[02:43:30]  And she ate most of the pizza and then had to eat more stuff.  And long story short, we didn't do anything because we spent the whole time eating.  Wow.  Fast forward, she leaves school.  I didn't know her that well, but a little bit here and there.  She leaves school.  And then homecoming weekend, I'm walking down Main Street, Geneseo, in front of Fat Augie's.  I know exactly where.  And all of a sudden, this beast comes running up to me.  This huge monster.  In a wrestling shirt.  All excited that she's seeing me. 
[02:44:00]  And goes, oh my God, I haven't seen you in whatever, a year.  And gives me a huge, good to see you again, hug.  And my arms don't even reach around her.  I guess she stopped, huh?  She, and yeah, then I learned through people and stuff that she had bulimia and figured it out.  That would have been funny if you said that to her.  Well, you obviously got over your bulimia.  No one ever wants to hear that.  No.  Wow, I can see you stop vomiting.  But the first part of the story, she was eating a lot, but she was making sure she got it out of her system. 
[02:44:30]  Purging.  Purging, yes.  I didn't even recognize her.  She probably, this memory is way old now.  She probably gained easily 50, 60 pounds.  Yeah.  Easily.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  Wow.  Sometimes that bulimia suits a girl.  You know, sometimes you ladies, it's a good choice for you.  You do it.  You said it after drinking, you can do it.  Well.  I can't do that. 
[02:45:00]  Sometimes after a night.  Let's try to make ourselves puke right now.  Oh, that would be great.  Some turkey chili with a red velvet fucking cupcake.  Show me my contract.  How do you do it?  Let's try this.  Well, what I do, sometimes I imbibe a bit too much.  And then it hits me and I realize, I go, uh-oh, this is going to be a problem.  This is going to be a wasted day tomorrow because I'm just going to be so badly hungover, I'm not going to be able to do anything. 
[02:45:30]  So I go to the bathroom and I go, um, take two fingers, you know, your pointer and your middle, and no, no, and I'm not going to do it.  And I hook them down my throat.  Let's do it for the show.  And you got to put the little punching bag thing in your throat right between your two fingers.  And then you got to kind of wiggle your fingers around a little.  And then when you start gagging, don't stop.  That's your fucking time where you go even more.  And then, blah.  Is it hard for you to make yourself continue without the hand on the back? 
[02:46:00]  Couldn't even barely get that one out, could you, Jim?  I'm eating crackers.  Just do it a little bit.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Uh-uh.  Wow.  Wow.  Okay.  How far down did you go?  Holy shit, Obi did my gag.  Wow, my eyes got watery.  Oh, man.  I don't know if I could...  How far down?  It wasn't even that bad.  All the way.  I double dare you.  That's not...  He's getting close. 
[02:46:30]  He's making himself gag.  He's retching.  Holy shit.  Someone else try it.  Oh, no.  That's disgusting.  Come on.  I'm the only one.  Someone else try it.  I can do it when I'm wasted.  Wow.  My eyes are tearing.  Someone else try it.  Come on.  No.  I can't.  People puking rules.  It really does.  It used to be so upsetting.  Yeah.  Now I don't care.  Try it.  Exactly.  The last time I came close was the Lady Di underwear.  Just try it.  Yeah, exactly.  Do what I'm saying.  Put a picture of a vagina. 
[02:47:00]  I always...  He's implying stuff.  I always did it wrong.  I went straight in.  No, you got hooked.  But you got to go...  Yeah, the hook is key.  That's the move.  Go ahead.  Try the hook.  I think I might actually puke, though.  Try the hook.  Go for it.  You better get a fucking pail.  Close the magnolias, Don.  Get a garbage pail.  Don, don, close the goddamn magnolias, Don.  Just enough to gag.  Try the...  My eyes are still watering.  Make them all giggy.  I didn't think it was that easy.  Could you...  Why right next to me?  Well, he needs a mic.  He's a pro.  Come on.  Try it. 
[02:47:30]  Put it by your mic.  Oh, he already...  I have a bad gag reflex.  You got a lot of food in you right now?  Yeah, I had a big one.  Why did Don leave?  Not really.  Don't look.  He's just walking away.  Fucking pussy.  He didn't even say goodbye.  He just left.  Taking his magnolias down.  All the way down.  And then keep just jiggling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you have to go to...  You want some bellybutton to stink?  I hate that feeling.  He's still gagging. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, that's bad.  That was a complete water.  That was a good one.  I'll try it one more time.  Okay.  All right.  Fucking chest hurts.  Yeah, that's bad.  Stop it.  This is disgusting.  One more?  Yeah.  I'll do one more.  Yeah, if you tickle the uvula.  Uvula. 
[02:48:30]  You're not doing it right, though.  Oh, it's so bad.  Yeah, you keep hitting it with your teeth.  Oh, here goes that.  Oh.  It's so disgusting.  Yeah, but you rule, because I never did it that way before.  That's the way.  If you ever have to puke.  No, but I would go, like, straight in.  No, you gotta hook.  I understand what you're saying.  You hook, because then you can get down the throat better.  That's where the magic happens.  Anyone else?  No, I'm not.  I think I'm okay.  I do what I'm saying.  Ask Heather B.  Heather B?  She's right out the side of the door. 
[02:49:00]  I've never puked from eating.  I've never been, like, puked from an illness.  Never puked with you, right, man.  Nope.  We're trying to make ourselves puke today.  You?  No, why?  Not me.  Yeah.  I'm not either.  Opie and Sal.  Well, because it gave me the new technique where, you know.  Well, sometimes I get a little, you know, on the weekends, a little wasted, and I think  to myself, like, I have a moment of clarity and go, oh, man, tomorrow's just going to  be fucked. 
[02:49:30]  By weekend, it means Tuesday.  What is your drink of choice?  I better, you know.  I like a couple of things.  I do like a little bit of wine.  Okay.  But if I'm doing some booze, it'll be, I like a vodka, OJ, and a splash of cranberry.  Sometimes I like some Captain Morgan and Coke, Jack Daniels and Coke, stuff like that.  But if I'm really going, and then I look at the clock, and I realize, oh, God, it's  3 a.m.  I am so fucking wasted.  I'll purge to get that out of there.  Okay, this is not really healthy. 
[02:50:00]  No, it's not.  The thing is, I usually take in a leave before, if I know I'm going for, like, I just had  a seven-hour brunch with my girlfriends on Sunday.  Oh, my God.  So I pop in a leave before I go.  It's not really good to mix pills, you know, obviously.  No, even a leave, yeah.  But I was here bright and early Monday morning.  No problems.  No stress.  That takes care of maybe the headache portion of it.  Yeah.  Was it a leave instead of the headache because there was going to be a bunch of women talking  a lot?  No, we actually don't really talk that much.  We eat. 
[02:50:30]  We have a good time.  Too many glasses up to the mouth to talk.  We don't have really chat.  I mean, talk about what?  Everybody's good.  Everybody's, you know, chilling.  We don't really do that much yapping.  It's just all about ching-ching, ching-ching.  A little drink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cling-cling.  Like fucking Bloody Marys or mimosas?  No.  Vodka.  Oh, okay.  Pineapple juice.  Jeez.  Sangria.  You know.  Because there's a brunch drink.  You can't go like night drinks with brunch.  Mimosas.  Mimosas.  Bloody Marys and Bellinis. 
[02:51:00]  That's the typical.  Yep.  But, I mean, after three bottles of champagne.  Yeah, right.  You kind of got to realize you need a drink.  Drink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I switched over to vodka during brunch.  Nothing better than being all wasted for brunch, walking outside and the sun hits you in the  eyes.  When you get hit by sunlight when you're drunk, it really kind of snaps you back.  Well, that's why with seven hours, we start in day and come out at night.  Oh, okay.  You don't want to go out.  You don't want to go out.  But what kind of wine do you like?  Red or white?  I can bring you guys wine on Friday.  I'm a red wine guy. 
[02:51:30]  Red wine?  Yeah.  Strong red Cabernet.  I like a good Cabernet.  I like a Shiraz.  I like a Chianti.  You like Malbec?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I love a Malbec.  All right.  Red wine for me.  Oh, man.  Wow, Heather B.  That's the deal.  Thank you, Heather.  All right.  No, I didn't know you drank wine.  I thought it was just a tequila bottle.  Oh, no.  I got you.  All right.  I got you.  Thanks, Heather.  There she goes.  A little popcorn, huh?  Yeah, man.  Breakfast.  Breakfast.  She's hilarious, man. 
[02:52:00]  Let's see.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Jersey.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hello.  Listen, when I was in college, we used to make our pledges chug water until they puke,  but we still do it to this day.  That's very dangerous.  Yeah, we lost one.  People die doing that.  Their brain, like, fucking leaks water, and you fucking die.  You can't hold it in.  Yeah.  If you guys are really trying to make yourself throw up, go get a big glass of hot water  or warm water and a big glass of cold water.  Chug the glass of warm water first, and then you pound the second one. 
[02:52:30]  The cold one, and it'll make you projectile vomit.  Is that true?  Yep.  It could kill somebody.  Would E-Rock try that?  I think he can.  I bet it'll kill him.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's see.  See if there's a video online.  There's no water drinking stunting allowed in radio shows anymore because of that guy that  drank the water.  Or the woman, right?  It was the woman.  And then she got, like, her brain fucking drowned.  That was the famous day where we blew up our spot with MSNBC. 
[02:53:00]  They never used us again.  Oh.  But it was so worth it.  That's right.  Got about that.  Is this it?  Is this the hot water, cold water puke?  Yeah.  It's like a bunch of bros about to do it.  Bunch of bros.  Look at these frat boys.  Are they browing down?  All right.  They got the cold and the warm.  Oh, shut up and just do it.  Yeah.  Four guys doing it.  You got hopes to run it right.  Four guys doing it.  You got to do it.  All right.  They're chugging, what, the warm water first, was it? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  They got now ice water.  They're going to get sick.  I don't know how I'm going to do it.  Oh, shut up.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Why does it do that?  I think it's probably just a muscle contraction thing at that point.  The video is shitty, though.  There's puking in shadows in the back.  I think it's like the muscles just, like, cramp up and push the puke out.  No, it can't over here. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, God.  It's definitely temperature-related and not, like, sick-related.  This guy can't do it.  It worked.  It worked.  Just puke all over his place.  Oh, God.  That's just a fraternity house.  You don't give a fuck.  Is there a better one, though?  Yeah, they puked all over the floor.  I don't even know where they were.  Yeah, you have the pledges.  That's not bad.  Clean it up.  Who cares? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, is that what you do?  Oh, yeah.  Have the plebes or whatever they're called?  Yep.  Wow, that was really disgusting.  I guess it works.  Yeah.  Donnie Wicklund ran from this fucking studio.  All right.  We'll take a break and wrap up the show next.  All right.  Jimmy, you got any plugs going on today or where you going to be?  Tampa, April 11th and 12th at the Side Splitters Comedy Club.  Tampon?  Okay.  I hope I get through this next one because I'm a side splitter and I tell jokes. 
[02:55:00]  You're sides and splitter.  Oh, nice.  And then April 24th through 27th here in New York at Caroline's.  It's three weeks away.  I'm going.  Three weeks out already.  Yeah, we're all going.  I hope everyone's getting their tickets.  Oh, yeah.  For Caroline's.  I am, I am, I am.  I want to witness you.  I want to witness you.  I want to witness you.  I want to witness you. 
[02:55:30]  I want to witness you.  I want to witness you.  How's STP with Chester, Chester, what's his last name?  The molester guy.  What's his name again?  Bennington.  Chester Bennington, right?  Oh, Ronnie B.  I want to witness you.  Chesty B.  What?  Oh, that fucking turkey chili made me hot.  Blackheart for you.  Oh, let's hear this.  Chester Bennington. 
[02:56:00]  Okay.  I don't know Blackheart.  What's that?  Is that a new song by those guys?  I don't know.  We can't judge.  We all know.  They hear the fucking classics.  Yeah, we need a classic.  You got something?  Chester.  It's got to be weird to sing someone else's songs, though, don't you think?  No.  Not for me.  Yeah, but someone like Chester, he's done a great job on his own.  What song is this?  Oh, Dead and Blow.  Dead and Blow.  Dead and Blow.  Dead and Blow.  Dead and Blow. 
[02:56:30]  Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr.  I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed.  Not bad.  I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me.  Because I'm...  Oh, you're supposed to sing that part.  I hate when they make the crowd sing.  I pay to see you.  Right. 
[02:57:00]  That's cool.  Oh, wait.  I want to hear a little bit of the actual...  That somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed.  I want to hear when he gets into, like, the actual...  I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me.  Because I'm dead and blowed in.  He sounds like he's...  He's not as strong.  He sounds like he's actually not...  Like he's at his peak when he's hitting some of these notes. 
[02:57:30]  It's like he's straining.  Right.  Like he's just falling flat at some of the notes.  He does a good job, but...  I'd see that.  Not bad.  But, I mean, Scott Weiland was a bit more powerful there, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't fucking like when you see a band live and the singer's just got that power fucking voice.  It's effortless.  It belts it out.  It's effortless.  It sounds just like the fucking record. 
[02:58:00]  Like Eddie Vedder.  Eddie Vedder?  Is he like that?  I don't know.  I've never seen him live.  No, actually, I did see Pearl Jam once.  Pearl Jam Live's amazing.  Before anyone even knew who the fuck they were.  They're amazing.  You gotta go.  Chili Peppers' opening act.  Them and Smashing Pumpkins and the Chili Peppers.  And no one gave a shit about Smashing Pumpkins.  Right.  And then Pearl Jam, people were psyched about, but it was like, oh, who's this new band?  Right.  It was Jeremy. 
[02:58:30]  Jeremy, and that was it?  No, I think it was before that.  Before Jeremy came out?  Yeah, it was like, Jeremy wasn't the song that was a hit at that time.  It was like their first fucking hit.  What was their first hit?  I don't know.  What was it?  The first hit was Jeremy.  No.  Yeah.  What was Pearl Jam's first fucking hit?  Come on, Travis.  You gotta know.  Jeremy.  Was it?  We all know that.  Damn, maybe it was?  Okay.  We're Pearl Jam heads.  I think so, at least.  I don't remember back then.  I am.  I thought it was like, yeah, Evenflo.  I thought Evenflo was a hit before Jeremy. 
[02:59:00]  No.  Sorry.  Geez.  Sorry.  I'm right.  Oh, you might be right, actually.  Motherfuckers.  All right, but it was all in the same album.  Yeah, back then it was all on MTV.  Yeah, but they pushed a song.  They pushed like one song, and that was the hit.  Was Evenflo the first song they pushed?  Alive was.  Alive?  Alive?  Have we done this before?  Oh, yeah, we have.  That's fine. 
[02:59:30]  We got a challenge coming in.  Kevin in Virginia.  Kevin.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey, buddy.  I just wanted to let you know I'm a truck driver.  Oh, good.  Thanks for the call.  Oh, more.  I think that song better than that guy does.  Yeah.  All right, let's hear it.  Are you ready?  Yep.  I am smelling like a rose that somebody gave me of a birthday deathbed.  I am smelling like a rose that somebody gave me. 
[03:00:00]  Because I'm dead and booted.  Not bad.  Well, yeah.  Okay.  It's comparable to what we just heard.  I kind of like it with the southern accent.  That's nice.  It was a little show-tune-y.  A few words were show-tune-y.  Show-tune.  I mean, he tailed off at the last note.  I'm a little nervous.  I like Plush better, though.  No, Plush is a great song.  That's a good.  Another guy saying Scott Weiland or nothing.  I kind of agree with him. 
[03:00:30]  I mean, Scott Weiland.  Like, is that his life ridiculous?  Yeah, he's got a lot of issues.  That would suck.  Yeah.  It's time for the nothing part.  Nothing.  Right.  Oh, by the way, what's Anthony's gamer tag?  I finally got some Xbox going on.  I don't think he's giving it out.  No, I'll give it out.  Oh, you are?  I'll give it out.  I'm playing better these days, so I'm not as embarrassed to play with other people online.  My kill-to-death ratio stinks, and I know it does, but it's because of the first few months 
[03:01:00]  I was playing, I was really, really bad.  I'm not very good, but at least I'm not that bad.  Why don't you start over?  I can't, because it goes with your whole thing that you signed up as.  Oh, okay.  For Xbox.  So it's like, it's a .31, my kill-death ratio.  Is that bad?  It's very bad.  One, if you have a one, it means that you've killed as many people as have killed you.  .3 means I've died so many more times.  So my gamer tag is bummer rat. 
[03:01:30]  I am bummer rat on the Xbox.  I'm also bummer rat on my PlayStation 4.  Right.  Awesome.  I've always wondered about that.  I remember you talking about it a long time ago, and I was like, damn, I don't even have  an Xbox now.  Yeah, I've gotten pretty good.  I play Call of Duty Ghosts.  Don't tell me to fucking play Battlefield.  Don't tell me to play any other game.  I play those.  I do still play them.  Titanfall, I play that.  But when I'm hanging out, drinking a few glasses of wine, playing some fucking games, it's 
[03:02:00]  going to be Call of Duty Ghosts.  And I usually play hardcore Domination.  So.  We usually play Black Ops 2.  And I, you know, I still suck at it too.  We've only had an Xbox for probably about three or four months.  Yeah.  So I still suck at it.  And yeah, it's great when you're drunk.  Yeah, I fucking love it.  And you know what I love about the Xbox One?  And this is the thing that people go, oh, why don't you like the PlayStation 4 as much  as the Xbox One?  You could sit there with any gaming system before Xbox One. 
[03:02:30]  It's not that it's a big pain in the ass, but just to grab the remote, change over to  your gaming system, find the controller, just, you're restarting a new kind of entertainment  thing.  Okay.  Going from TV to the game.  With Xbox, I just sit there and if nothing's on TV, I just go, Xbox, go to Call of Duty  Ghosts.  Boom.  The game is fucking on, ready to play.  So you're not like, you don't have to go like, ah, I got to change over, fuck it.  It makes it that much easier. 
[03:03:00]  And then you don't have to play all night.  It's a few games and then I'll just go, eh, Xbox, watch TV.  And then you're back to TV.  That to me is worth the difference between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.  There's really not much of a difference.  Anthony, did you watch the Call of Duty Championships this weekend?  No, I didn't.  Why would I do that?  How awful is that?  I know, you're watching a game.  I don't want to watch the game, I want to play the game.  Yeah, I was busy, I got caught up in the centipede playoffs. 
[03:03:30]  I was getting my Frogger machine out of the pizza place and into my house.  I love you guys, I've been listening to you for years, thanks a lot.  All right, good job at the singing too, Kevin.  Hope the lopper don't get me.  That was a terrible thing to watch.  Yeah.  Call of Duty Grand Finale, please.  And giving out his gamer tag allows everyone everywhere to know everything about you, is  that true?  Well, they'll know what I watch on TV sometimes and stuff.  Oops.  No, I mean, you know, Netflix, it's harmless, I don't give a shit.  Why would they do that? 
[03:04:00]  I don't know, because it's going through your Xbox, so if I go to Xbox, go to Netflix, it'll  be like, oh, what's Anthony doing?  Oh, Anthony's watching Netflix right now.  But why would they be able to see that?  Yeah, that doesn't...  Can you turn that off?  Because it'll also say like, oh, Anthony's playing Call of Duty Ghost right now, so people  go, oh, let me get in touch with them.  They can't watch TV with you, I understand if it's a game, because they're like, oh,  I can now play with Anthony.  Oh, I'm not saying it's a good thing.  That's stupid.  I don't like it.  It could probably be turned off.  I'm sure it can.  Yeah, go to your settings.  Privacy settings.  But personally, I don't care.  Yes. 
[03:04:30]  Anthony is watching a documentary Gay in America again.  The 40th time.  The Jim Norton story.  The Jim Norton story.  Oh, man.  It's been a battle all morning.  Oh, my God.  I backed into that one with my cheek spread.  Wow.  Wow.  That was a damn good one.  People need to know, was it Evenflo or Alive? 
[03:05:00]  It wasn't Jeremy, but now people say, no, it was Evenflo, and then people say it was Alive.  In terms of the singles from 10 to Wikipedia, Alive was first, Evenflo, Jeremy, then Oceans.  They only promoted four singles off that album.  No, no, no.  That was a good album, I must say.  What else was on there now?  They didn't even really, Oceans wasn't here.  Yeah, Oceans didn't really push at all, to be honest with you.  Black, they didn't push?  No.  Why wouldn't they push Black?  That could be the best song on the whole album.  Back then, they didn't single up everything. 
[03:05:30]  Like, an album was an album.  Oh, shut up.  You know?  That's some dumb 20-year-old hipster trying to tell me about back then.  Yeah, exactly.  Tell us about the album.  Back then.  Back then.  What are you talking about?  You were two.  How old were you?  It was one and a half.  See, if it was August of 91, I was, uh, that would make me 11.  No, 13 months.  13 months.  I just said that.  With a full beard. 
[03:06:00]  So, why are you telling me about back then?  Yeah, actually.  I don't know about recording history.  History is history.  Oh, God.  13 months, his first words were trying to explain how his rattle got in there.  Mama.  You were right around a year old.  That's crazy.  No, I know you know your way around a fucking...  They called him the old two-nooky kid.  I did it for the nooky. 
[03:06:30]  The nooky.  Where's my nook?  Oh.  Oh, God damn.  You were that young.  Holy shit.  That's just fucking crazy.  Well, the album is 23 years old.  20, right?  Yeah, 23.  Wow.  That's sad.  I made my bones while you were banging cheerleaders.  Yep.  You pinnies.  What about this Toronto guy?  Oh, this...  The mayor?  Oh, that crazy guy?  We got a crazy guy on the street. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, this is...  The man goes crazy in Toronto.  Fashion Studio 7's this magazine, and this poor girl's just trying to do a man on the street thing.  Right.  And she had no idea this was coming.  This is...  What's your name?  My name...  Oh, let me tell you my name.  I'm confused because, you know, like we're supposed to believe in the ministry, right?  So is the church and state supposed to be separate? 
[03:07:30]  I'm confused because I never went to school.  Right?  Is a confused person get a resolution?  I don't understand.  You see, when you go like that, right, you have a cross, two sticks, right?  And that's how I felt when I was in Waterloo.  Because when I walked in Waterloo and smiled at people, they treated me like a vampire.  They used the cross. 
[03:08:00]  And they went like this by not smiling at me.  In Toronto...  Hey, hi guys.  You know me.  Steve Spiros.  Easy going.  Those who know me, I'm a nobody.  You understand?  And you can't kill a person with no body.  So, why am I afraid?  I'm not afraid.  I'm afraid of the boogeyman.  Who's the boogeyman?  You figure it out.  I'm getting out of here.  I'm going back to Waterloo where the vampires hang out. 
[03:08:30]  And I'm going to wear my sunglasses that night.  You know why?  Because women show their tits, have short skirts, and then they feel violated when I look at them.  Why?  Because I have sunglasses on and I'm weird.  Uh, I'm from Humberside.  I'm sorry if I made a fool of Humberside, but all those people who called me a sleepwalker, I woke up.  Now I'm going back to sleep because I'm going to be committed in an isolation room because I'm going to go back to the ministry and allow them to perceive me as I am. 
[03:09:00]  A fuck up!  Wow.  Goodbye!  Hey, Toronto the good.  Wait.  Look at this square.  It was a shithole when I worked here.  Now it looks like New York, Manhattan.  New York, Manhattan.  Where are the bums?  There's no bums here.  Toronto doesn't have bums.  But Waterloo, they're creating bums.  They created me.  Why? 
[03:09:30]  I don't know.  Maybe it's the church.  Talk to the Pope.  He knows everything.  I had it.  I'm going to die.  How can you die when you're dead?  What is...  Is he crazy?  I'm going to be crucified, right?  He opened his shirt and showed his chest.  I'm not going to raise my voice.  Because I'm committed to the Lord.  I thought it was fake at first, but...  I love you.  I think he's crazy.  Yeah, but her reaction kind of makes me think that it wasn't fake. 
[03:10:00]  I think he's also, you know, wants the attention.  Oh, hi, Sam.  I'm going to take a couple hours off today, I see.  Sam, are you actually going to do an after show or anything?  Are you going to be lollygagging in the back?  What the hell were you doing for the last hour and a half?  Getting compliments from the bosses?  Just giving Sal some shine.  Some shine.  That's right.  He did try to...  That's what the kids say, right?  Yeah.  That's what they call it.  He did try to puke himself, so...  Yeah, I noticed that five minutes after he was in the studio, he had his fingers down  his throat to try to impress Opie. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Let's get out of here, then.  All right, let's.  And yes, I am doing an after show today.  Oh.  It fits into my schedule.  It does.  It fits today.  No WWE stuff.  Lucky nobody.  Huh?  Oh.  Oh.  What?  That's your new nickname.  How was the press conference?  Fun?  It's fucking awesome.  Yeah.  What'd they say?  We've already picked the winners, and...  Hulk wouldn't like you. 
[03:11:00]  He's giving his body to wrestling.  It's not fake.  You did WrestleMania interviews.  It's on your channel.  That's right.  I talked to John Cena, Hulk Hogan, and Daniel Bryan.  You do very well in the wrestling world.  What is John Cena?  Thanks.  John Cena what?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  No.  Couldn't think of nothing.  Whoa.  What the fuck?  Thank you.  Dennis Falcone?  Oh, a fan.  Oh, no. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, no.  Sealed.  That sucks.  Look for needle marks on the top.  Exactly.  I watched the Columbo once.  He was able to get fucking poison in a bottle of wine.  Huh?  Chubby brother.  Who?  Why does he have creds?  Thank you.  I'm like, Emilio L. Jackson, uh, beautiful.  Mmm.  Not you.  When is he here?  Who kid?  Get out.  Who kid?  Who kid?  You like the Ensign Minis?  Hey, who dat?  How are you, who dat?  What up, son?  Ah, this smells so fucking good.  That's a little classic crumb cake.  Oh, that's a crumb cake.  This kid has no neck. 
[03:12:00]  You know who's at the WrestleMania press conference with me?  Who kid?  Who kid?  I saw the, I saw the pics.  I love.  That is not a thing.  I'm up on the game.  The brothers in wrestling, it's not really a big thing.  Yeah, are you kidding me?  Oh, come on, really?  Black dudes love wrestling.  Do black dudes like, even since the Coco Beware left?  Caribbean people.  Caribbean people.  Maybe, I know Coco Beware was a big, uh, draw for the black man.  Hulk Hogan was kind of swagged out.  He's not wearing, uh, cowboy boots anymore.  He's, he's not, fuck cowboy boots.  Who did?  Jordan's now.  I think, I think he's tamed down his, his shtick a little.

Apparently, you could steal a shopping cart, right?  And then, you know the part of the shopping cart?  You put the dog food in or the fucking bottled water on the bottom of the cart?  Oh, under it.  Yeah, you put the wood there.  Then you put your steaks in the cart on the bottom of the cart.  They're stealing?  And you got a grill.  Look.  No, get the fuck out of here.  Play some.

You think I have to reenact this whole thing right here. 
[03:15:00]  Get some onion on it, nigga.  I love these guys.  I would have whitened it up a little bit and got some nice tinfoil.  Tinfoil?  What you talking?  That's really niggery right there.

Yo, get exclusive on his meat.  Exclusive. 
[03:15:30]  You guys will get a lot of meat and then you squeeze it, tenderize it.  Shop and court.  I do that?  Yeah.  And if the cops show up, you could push your whole barbecue somewhere.  You could just fucking...  It looks black, so you look normal.  You could do that.  You should know about tenderizing meat.  Where do you get them tongs?  Some good shit right there.

The Eiffel Tower.  Oh, the drunk tourism.  How was the Eiffel Tower?  It was cool because I DJ'd till five in the morning.  I got so drunk that I ran out in the streets where there was nobody out there, and I was  doing drunk tourism.  There was no one at the Eiffel Tower.  No one at the Louvre.  The Louvre.  Nobody.  I was like the nigga Da Vinci code.  I was looking at the fucking wall. 
[03:17:00]  I was looking at the bushes and shit.  You fucking roll.  Where's Jesus at?  Trying to figure out the signs.  Trying to get Jesus black.  I don't know what you guys think.  He's trying to decode.  What happened?  I lost my mic for a minute.  Oh, God.  I don't know where it went.  That's back.  Trying to decode that shit.  Fucking A.  That's funny.  You know?  That's funny.  That's funny shit.  But, yeah, anyway, but I'll be out there, uh, rocking parties.  Nice.  Formula One is out there.  The racing thing.  Oh, shit. 
[03:17:30]  You know, like Formula One.  We're Americans.  We're Americans.  We're all about NASCore.  Love, really?  What about the NASCore?  God, fuck, fuck, watch the NASCore.  I don't understand the racing thing.  Like, they, even if you win, who cares?  It's like, they have like a $10 million car, and it's just running around the tracks.  Nobody gives a fuck.  It's like a rich hobby or something.  It is.  It is.  It's like a rich hobby.  Unless it's NASCore.  A lot of white people, uh, in racing.  Is NASCore like that, too?  People just running around with more white people.  NASCore is a party.  Oh, okay.  In the infield.  There's a couple of black people. 
[03:18:00]  Do the billionaires, like, tongue each other and stuff like that in NASCore?  What?  No, there's no billionaires.  NASCore is a lot more good old boy.  Formula One is, uh.  Formula One is like your rich fucking European trash.  Right.  Your Euro trash.  Yeah.  Right now.  What's his name?  I had on my show.  Jimmy Johnson.  He said they'd be trying to kiss him and stuff.  Really?  Uh.  There goes Renault.  Renault McLaren.  I love your rumors.  I know.  Just.  You know Jimmy's my home.  You know what I do right there.  He can't help but make a fool of himself.  Yesterday at the press conference.  It was all press.  Oh, my God. 
[03:18:30]  I hate you.  I hate this fucking guy.  There was no fans there.  Yeah.  So it was like the wrestlers were even commenting on the fact that they were trying to, like,  hype people up.  But we were all just kind of sitting there looking at him.  So he's awkward.  But now, see, you're fucking jaded.  Years ago, you'd have been, like, creaming.  I was cheering.  You could ask who kid.  I was cheering.  Yeah, he was.  He was a fucking group.  But it was like the rest of the people.  There was a Hard Rock Cafe press conference.  There was, like, you know, a couple dozen people there.  Mm-hmm.  But Hulk Hogan goes, what you're going to do?  And then there's one idiot in the middle of the crowd that just starts yelling. 
[03:19:00]  That's me, nigga.  When Hulk Hogan goes, what?  And he's turning around and who kid.  It was who kid?  He's finishing.  But I thought he used to scream.  When I was young in Haiti, I thought he was screaming, I'm coming for you.  But I didn't know that.  No, he didn't.  He kept doing the quote wrong.  Oh, no.  So Hulk Hogan kept trying to get him to start again.  He kept doing it wrong.  Oh, what you going to do?  I'm coming for you.  And everybody was like, yeah.  No, that's not how it went.  Why weren't there any fans there?  They didn't let him in. 
[03:19:30]  They just let press in.  Yeah, but the fans would have really given it a lot of energy, no?  Yeah.  That sucks.  That sucks.  All right.  You guys have fun.  It's your show now, Sam.  Yeah, whatever.  Ain't your show, Elias.  Protect my coffee cake.  You have to like diss me for the old day.  That's cool.  It's like a crossover, like the old radio days.  That's right.  Just do that.  Hey, look.  It's fucking, you know.  Hey, thanks.  Ozone.  Remember that?  Hey, it's Ozone.  We're taking over for...  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Hey, what do you guys do it? 
[03:20:00]  Come on, Sam.  Why are you going to play me like that for these guys?  You look like an idiot.  That's right.  Like yesterday.  Hey, at least he was doing something.  Yeah, man.  You now, you're too fucking big, and you know these guys too well to be all excited anymore.  You know what Hulk Hogan said when I interviewed him yesterday?  Get the fuck away from me.  No, he did not.  He said this.  There's a familiar face.  Oh!  I was going, brother.  I was like, yeah, brother.  Yeah, brother.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was digging it.  I got to say, what's the half's brother to him?  That's exciting.  Brother.  And John Cena was cool, too. 
[03:20:30]  He didn't freestyle, though.  No, but he put his arm around me.  Did you see him touch me?  No, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  He has his arm around me.  E-Rock went, right?  Yeah.  Now, was he excited?  Because he's kind of a little fanboy.  Yeah, but he keeps to himself.  Oh.  He's like a...  He wants to think that he's on the same level as you, where you're like, oh, there's  a familiar face, but he's just still a little fanboy.  Well, he was wearing a WrestleMania sweatshirt.  Oh!  Oh, yeah, he did.  He did.  Oh, what a dead giveaway.  And it was WrestleMania from like two years ago.  That's like the dick that would go to the concert wearing the concert t-shirt. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  You don't want to do that.  No.  I don't understand those fans.  I don't either.  They look like they all shop at Kmart outside.  Yeah.  It's called white people.  Yeah.  They're like dirty clothes.  They're like dirty gear on outside.  Dirty shit.  You're right.  Yeah.  They're a bunch of dirty motherfuckers.  Dirty sneakers.  I don't want wrestling shit.  We don't buy clothes.  No.  All right, kids.  You guys have fun.  You guys have fun. </pre>
