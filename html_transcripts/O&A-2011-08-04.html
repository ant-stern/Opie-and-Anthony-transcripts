<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous intro featuring Larry King, seguing into a discussion about the hosts’ post-show relationships with past guests.  They debated whether their initial negative opinions changed after guests appeared, citing examples like their continued dislike of Jesse Ventura, contrasted with their softening towards Whoopi Goldberg.  Other guests mentioned included Piers Morgan, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Bill Donahue.  A significant portion focused on Steve the Whistler, a recurring bit featuring recordings of his whistling, which the hosts mocked extensively, speculating on his life and attempting (unsuccessfully) to whistle themselves. This was followed by a bizarre anecdote about one host’s friend having a dog ejaculate on him in a motel lobby.  They then speculated humorously about the role of Gary, an absent SiriusXM employee, exaggerating his importance before concluding he was likely a middle manager.  A discussion about Rolling Stone's ranking of Green Day as the greatest punk band sparked a debate about punk credentials and a musical interlude featuring The Clash.

The show continued with further discussion of Rolling Stone's unsatisfactory punk band list, leading to a discussion of GG Allin's shocking stage antics and his purported respect for Johnny Cash.  The conversation shifted to birthdays and their emotional complexities, particularly for single people, prompted by a caller recounting a paranormal experience involving flickering lights potentially linked to the deaths of both the caller’s and a host’s father. This led to a humorous anecdote about one host finding his father’s stash of Marilyn Monroe nudes.  Further attempts to elicit paranormal signs proved unsuccessful.  The conversation then turned to Reverend Al Sharpton, focusing on his perceived exploitation of racial issues, dissecting a disagreement with Pat Buchanan over the use of "boy" in reference to President Obama, and debating the racial implications of various potentially offensive terms.  The death of Bubba Smith was announced, prompting reminiscences and the playing of Miller Lite commercials.  A news story about a Cranston, Rhode Island resident wishing death upon his cancer-stricken neighbor was also discussed.  Upcoming guests were mentioned: the cast of *The Book of Mormon*, Rich Vos, and Otto.  A debate ensued about California's inclusion of gay history in school curriculum, expanding into a broader discussion about the value of different school subjects, featuring various caller anecdotes and the hosts’ personal experiences.  Jennifer Hudson and one host's child's obsession with her Weight Watchers commercial were also mentioned.

The segment featuring Otto, his visibly thinner friend Big A, and a surprise appearance by Don Cheadle covered a wide range of topics.  Otto recounted a Martha's Vineyard trip, including a private plane ride and speculation about John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crash.  Elvis's alleged undeserved accolades were discussed, followed by an anecdote about Opie’s encounter with Nixon’s Secret Service at the Statue of Liberty.  Big A’s weight loss was the subject of jokes, transitioning into a discussion of Boston comedians, with Otto criticizing Jimmy Tingle and playing a ridiculed clip of his stand-up.  Otto shared a positive anecdote about Lenny Clark, who facilitated meetings with high-profile individuals like Bill Belichick.  The conversation touched on bed and breakfasts versus hotels, hotel cleanliness, and personal habits.  A significant portion involved reminiscing about *Fargo*, quoting lines and discussing its dark humor.  Famous Hollywood deaths were discussed, including anecdotes about John Belushi's grave and morbid details about various celebrities' deaths, mentioning Hollywood death tours.  The segment concluded with promotion for Otto’s show and giveaways of *Eastbound and Down* DVDs.

Four members of the *Book of Mormon* cast (Andrew Rannells, Rory O’Malley, Josh Gad, and Nikki M. James) appeared in studio.  The hosts praised the show's humor, profanity, and originality, discussing ticket difficulty, Tony Awards anecdotes (including Josh Gad bringing snacks), audience reactions, and marketing strategies.  They also discussed their favorite reality shows, like *Toddlers & Tiaras* and *Hoarders*.  The segment concluded with plugs for the guests' projects and further discussion of the show’s success, mentioning Otto’s upcoming appearance, Chevy Chase’s previous appearance, and the show's use by Mormon missionaries.

The final segment was dominated by a problematic attempt to play Steve the Whistler’s CD, plagued by technical difficulties and comedic banter involving various cleaning methods (including a helmet).  Other anecdotes included a listener’s story about a friend masturbating a dog onto his arm, a staff birthday involving 50 uneaten chicken biscuits, a tribute to Bubba Smith (including a clip from a previous Black History Month segment), Roland's “steak dump,” Guy Fieri spraying vodka into Eric’s mouth instead of water, and a discussion of the hosts’ and staff’s relationships, specifically Eric and Troy, and Troy’s relationship with a Ron & Fez intern.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  I guess my nipples hogging.  You know what I mean?  Are you out of your mouth?  Not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Yeah, good morning, by the way.  By the way.  By the way.  Can't even say by the way.  By the way.  What's wrong with that guy?  By the way.  We liked him.  Of course.  In the end, we really liked Larry King.  He was entertaining, as they say.  Sometimes you just got to fold, right? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  We couldn't stick to our guns on the Larry King thing.  He came in here and he was really cool.  We can't stick to our guns on anybody that we make fun of once they come in.  We do all right.  Our percentage is pretty low of people that we continue really fucking over and hating after they come in here.  Name one.  Jesse the body, and that was Jimmy.  What are you talking about?  Well, he came in.  Yeah.  We thought he was a douche.  Yeah.  He came in and was a bigger douche than we even anticipated. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  And then what happened?  And then Jimmy laid into him.  Yeah.  We didn't sit there and kiss his ass.  Right.  And Jimmy laid into him, and he left and never came back.  So that's sticking to our guns.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  That's what I'm saying.  But it's so rare.  Oh, no.  I mean, give me an example of someone we didn't stick to our guns with.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you just confused the hell out of me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Like, of course we stuck to our guns with Jesse Ventura.  Whoopi?  Yeah, but that was fun. 
[00:02:00]  We caved in so fucking hard on Whoopi.  We cave in all the time.  That was fun, though.  That was a big setup, man.  Sarah Jessica Parker?  That was fun.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's just fun.  Well, Larry, of course.  Whoopi came in.  Piers Morgan.  Piers Morgan was better than I thought he was going to be.  We never really bashed Piers.  Oh, yeah.  I bashed Piers Morgan.  Really?  Did you?  Really?  Yeah, he came in.  And because of that show, I told him I didn't like the way he did Chips, but I mean, he turned 
[00:02:30]  out to be a cool guy.  And what's that?  Wait, what show?  America's Got Talent?  Yeah.  He didn't like Mr. Cooney.  But he was a fun interviewer.  I had bashed him before, saying he was kind of a prick and pompous and I didn't like him.  Bill Donahue?  Bill Donahue's another one.  I still kind of show it.  You guys have moved on.  I have no dislike for that guy whatsoever.  I haven't moved on from that fucking guy at all.  There are a couple that we each have different feelings about. 
[00:03:00]  Me and Bill Donahue?  Uh-uh.  I know what that guy really is about.  And he would do it again tomorrow.  Well, I think other guests, but I think we do all right.  We sure warmed up to Steve the Whistler.  What?  We should have him back.  Dustin Diamond.  I told you that I saw Steve the Whistler on 72nd Street.  He gave me a look and I'm like, okay, he so knows who I am.  Sometimes I wonder if I get the look when I'm walking around, but in this case, oh yeah. 
[00:03:30]  And then he stopped his whistle and walked really fast away from it.  Steve the Whistler curbs the 2002 international grand champion.  Is that his website now?  Yeah.  Why hasn't he updated his website?  Because he hasn't won in nine years.  He's still sitting on the back of that shitty car with his Whistler license plate.  It's the old license plate.  It's the old Liberty plate, I think. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I guess he has a cool sweater.  That says debut CD.  That CD is now nine years old.  Yeah.  Do we have any Steve the Whistler in the system?  He was inducted into the 2007 Whistler's Hall of Fame.  That's the last thing that's on his website.  Do you think when it's all done that Steve the Whistler will be one of the major moments  from this radio show?  I think so.  I thought you said when it's all said and done, he blows his fucking head off. 
[00:04:30]  Fucking, I can't get enough of Steve the Whistler.  Where's any gigs?  He might be done finally.  Yeah.  I think we've moved on from whistling.  I hate the Percy photo that they have, the action shot.  Every picture of him, he's whistling, so it always looks like he's just going, whoa.  Yeah.  E-Rock's got some Steve the Whistler for us.  E-Rock.  I just want a song.  I don't want us fucking with him.  People have heard that bit enough. 
[00:05:00]  He really can whistle.  I don't have any of his songs in there.  Oh, E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, you got some.  You do?  Unreal player.  Come on.  Come on.  This is so bad.  Son of a bitch can whistle a tune.  But who cares?  Where's the audience for this?  Even America's Got Talent didn't grab his shit. 
[00:05:30]  You are not listening to this in your car.  No.  On your fucking iPhone.  No.  You just, oh.  What's it sound like?  Like shit?  It sounds like oldie time radio being tuned in.  Yeah.  But even if you're a bad whistler, you're an okay whistler.  You know what I mean?  Like, that's a great whistler, but if I start whistling, it's similar now.  Can you whistle?  Of course.  Of course.  And he's running through some kind of processor. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, I'm sure.  Is he?  I can't whistle.  I've never learned how to whistle.  My whole life, I wanted to be one of those guys that could go like, whistle!  Like with the fingers in the mouth.  Oh, yeah.  You ever see those guys that could whistle and fucking blow the windows out of a place?  I don't need the fingers in the mouth.  I could just go like, maybe the tranny penis is just knocked your teeth.  No, that's not what happened.  Knocked your teeth around, but you can't whistle anymore. 
[00:06:30]  No, that would actually help me whistle.  Oh, you could do the two-finger whistle?  No, I can't do any.  Who did that?  Of course.  God.  Yeah, of course he can.  Is he awful?  Oh, is he awful.  Who's whistling still?  Mars.  Wait, Steve the Whistler's still whistling without the music?  Okay, let's listen without the music.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:07:00]  This is so annoying.  What is he trying to accomplish?  It's so fucking annoying.  What is he doing?  You think he bores his family to death around the holidays?  Oh, you guys know.  It's a tradition.  Christmas songs.  Everyone gather around.  In his sweater.  Throwing chestnuts.  I bet you want to bang his front teeth with a hammer. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, that would be great.  I'll just make it so he can't whistle anymore.  I can't do it.  My whistling career.  Just that one chip that fucks up his...  What's that?  Oh, boy.  Fucks up his whistling, and the dentist can't get it back.  I can do that.  Now I got it.  Turn that down a second.  I can't do it.  I think I got it.  Fuck.  Here goes a Christmas song.  Here it is.  Here it is.  There. 
[00:08:00]  Where's my fucking album?  Wow, that's really good.  Where's my fucking album?  Now go right to Steve the Whistler to prove that that's comparable to what Steve's doing  with his crap.  I put some echo on it.  I'm golden.  It's the same shit.  It's gold.  It's gold, Jimmy.  Gold.  What makes him special?  His sweater?  And his license plate. 
[00:08:30]  And his license plate?  And his license plate.  Yeah, you don't have a whistling license plate.  And that big, heavy, dumb sweater.  You don't have to spell it all weird.  And the horrible old man car that he drives.  Can we hear another song?  Sure.  I don't even know what song this is.  Yeah, what song was that?  That was Tura Lura Lura.  How about you play one and we guess what the song is?  That sounds to blast at a dictator's house at three in the morning to get him to come  out.  Get it?  It's annoying. 
[00:09:00]  See?  That's what they did to Noriega.  Holy shit.  We have a neighbor situation in Rhode Island.  We've got to get to it in a second.  What?  Chris, don't go anywhere.  We're going to do another whistling song here.  Oh, Amber Waves of Grains.  Here it is.  Big one. 
[00:09:30]  Is that a mountaintop?  Purple Mountain's Majesty.  Majesty.  It's a fruity plane.  Above the fruity plane.  There's a studio next door.  There you go.  At least the thing was fun as a kid.  Someone would say God shaved his grace.  Oh, nice.  We would all laugh.  All right. 
[00:10:00]  Enough.  Wow.  How many dogs are in the apartments right now with their heads just tilting?  That adorable dog tilting head with their ears straight up, hanging like little triangles 
[00:10:30]  from the side of their head.  When they're curious, they hear something, they're not sure what it is.  Oh, yeah.  And they tilt their head.  And their little pink lipstick dick sticks straight out over the rug.  What's cuter than a curious dog with a hard-on?  With a hard-on with that yellow fucking discharge coming out of his dick?  My friend Jimmy made his dog cum on me.  He had a dog named Fred.  It's true.  A little awful mutton in Fred.  He jerked him off on me. 
[00:11:00]  It's true.  Why, man?  He was just like tugging the dog's penis.  Either that or it was piss.  No, I doubt it was piss.  I don't think he was either.  Where were your parents when all this craziness was going on?  This was in the lobby in North Brunswick of a fucking terrible motel.  You took the dog to the motel?  No, we used to walk through there.  We used to cut through.  I don't remember why.  We would go there.  To jerk the dog off.  How old were you?  Maybe 14 or whatever.  We used to go there. 
[00:11:30]  I used to go drunk and take food off room service trays in the hallway.  Nice.  I'd have been eating.  You know something?  I'd walk through and eat food.  Sometimes I'd eat some rice stuff.  A smorgasbord.  It's a cornucopia of food.  I would do that.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Steve the Whistler, any updates there, Sam, before we move on?  That website's just frozen in time?  Yeah, 2007 Whistling Hall of Fame at that point.  There's a Hall of Fame.  Of course there is.  You have to be 25 years from pussy to be eligible.  What kind of car is that, by the way? 
[00:12:00]  Is that a Buick LeSabre?  A Duttebaker.  I don't know.  That is just an awful vehicle.  Yeah.  And he's all proud of it.  He's in the woods.  Where is he?  He's in the woods with his car.  Yeah.  Look at his boots.  He's got his boots.  He's got his boots.  He's perfectly symmetrical in that shot.  What kind of pussy does whistling get you, you think?  Oh, no.  Hall of Fame pussy.  Hall of Fame pussy.  Girls will fuck you to stop.  What kind of woman would go to a whistling show, you think? 
[00:12:30]  I really want to know more about this whistling shit.  Look at him.  He's in that sweater.  He's making a face that looks like he just buried the corpse of a young girl in those woods behind him.  He probably whistles a happy tune as he's shoveling a shallow grave.  Her little ribbon's being covered.  He's got a P.O. box for contact, but then he's also got his PR company for media requests.  Should we get him back on the show?  Oh, boy. 
[00:13:00]  We want you back on the show.  Want me to put out some feelers and see if...  Ten years later, because I bet you that bit's about ten years old now.  Yeah.  What's the license to roam?  Other links.  Ooh, other links.  For Steve the Whistler.  Here we go.  Oh, it's custom license plates.  Oh, no.  That's...  Why would you have a website for...  Because he got his custom Whistler license plate, I bet.  From this company.  But you could just go to the DMV.  Yeah.  You just go to the DMV.  You know what? 
[00:13:30]  I bet he couldn't get that plate, and it's not legit.  Oh, it's a fake plate.  So he put...  He got this place to get him a Whistler plate, put it on, took the picture, had to take it  off.  Oh, because he doesn't want to be pulled over.  Because it's not his real fucking plate.  Oh, boy.  He's...  In 2011, he's still hilarious.  He just put it on to look cool for the picture.  To look cool.  With that plate between his fucking ridiculous boots.  You think that's what's going on? 
[00:14:00]  He was inducted in 2007 into the Whistler Hall of Fame.  So you mean to tell me that after he was on our show, he was inducted?  Yeah.  Like, he was gunning for that?  I guess.  Five more years in the trenches until he finally got in.  Yeah.  What's that ceremony?  I bet you that the fucking...  The ceremony Pesci went to in Goodfellas was better attended than the Whistler Hall of Fame.  I bet you there's only...  Oh, no.  I bet you there's only 20 Whistlers in the world, and 17 of them get into the Hall of Fame. 
[00:14:30]  And then the recipient of the 2003, 2004, and 2005 International Whistling Entertainer of the Year Award.  Well, who was this competition?  International...  International...  International...  That's worldwide.  I imagine he had to deal with some guy from Sweden.  Yeah.  Some just asshole from Sweden.  Trying to take the throne?  Yeah.  I'm thinking a Russian, too.  And a Russian do one of those Russian...  No.  Oh, Chippy Jim.  I'm thinking one of those Russian guys that do that Russian dance. 
[00:15:00]  No, no Russians.  That wacky Cossack dance or something.  No.  And since the website link for the fake license plates is on his website, it means he brokered  a deal.  And he said, look, if you hook me up with a free plate, I'll give you a link on my...  What do you want?  Whistler.  I want Whistler.  On my dead website.  This is what's called a dead website.  Dead site.  It's just dead.  No updates.  It's nothing.  Box 7044, Aftergast Station, New York, New York.  Available for commercials, movies, soundtracks, television, radio appearances, concert performances, 
[00:15:30]  and private functions.  Concert performances.  How much do you think it would charge for him to just come over to my house and whistle  for a while?  Wouldn't that be great?  Y'all do it.  What do you got?  Oh, you shake a shit.  You make him stand outside the bathroom and whistle for you.  It helps your bowels move.  Hire him for your parents' anniversary, Sam.  I will.  That'd be great.  Just muffled by the door a little...  He's got to stand there. 
[00:16:00]  You open the door when you're done, he gets a waft of your fucking sewer ass, and you pay  him in small bills and he leaves.  Stupid Steve the Whistler.  You hear it through the door.  That's funny.  Yeah, that's true.  How many tapes do you think he sends in to Irish Spring?  Look, I'm good.  Or Old Spice. 
[00:16:30]  He wants to be the new guy, probably.  Yeah.  All right, well...  Good for you, Steve the Whistler.  The muffled sound through the door.  Oh, that's great.  The muffled sound.  And he just...  He's so happy when he hears the... 
[00:17:00]  Of the toilet paper on the roll.  He knows you're done.  Looks at his watch.  Oh, boy.  Or he loves when he hears the grunt and the kerplosh in the water.  It's another job.  Well done.  He doesn't like when he hears plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop.  Those rabbit pellet ones.  You're going to be there a while.  You're not done.  He's got to fucking switch songs.  Well, he hates when he hears the flush before the belt getting pulled up,  because he knows you've got at least a double flusher.  You're going to double flusher. 
[00:17:30]  You'll be wiping a while.  He's still outside.  Wow, you can whistle.  Maybe you should take him on.  I should take him on.  You should take his crown.  How great would that be?  That I take his crown.  The ultimate insult.  Anthony joins the whistling world and takes his fucking international crown.  I'd hate to have to fucking cut off myself from any pussy.  But it's all he's got.  It really is all he has.  How great would it be to take away the one thing he has? 
[00:18:00]  But I think he'd be magnanimous.  He'd be one of those guys that comes up and shakes your hand and goes,  you know what?  Right.  It was a good battle.  You're just, you know, the better whistler won.  Like, shut up.  Punch him in his face.  But then you take the international award and throw it in the garbage on the way out.  Right in front of everybody.  Just smash it on the floor.  Right.  Walk away going, whistling a happy tune.  Can we hear another Steve the Whistler song?  One more little Steve the Whistler. 
[00:18:30]  I would love to.  And by the way, in 2005, it was a guy from the Netherlands that took the title.  I told you.  Ah, the Netherlands.  You could just tell those people would be into whistling.  Uh-oh.  What if he uses the same piano player every time?  Piano player wants to fucking, he's got to booze up before he goes there.  Can't take it.  I can't get that high.  This is the sad part of a Chaplin movie.  Yeah.  Silent movie.  Chaplin's just walking around all depressed. 
[00:19:00]  His pockets are out.  He goes, I got no money.  Yeah, he's looking for Jackie Cougar, the little dick dick.  Yeah, the cop is chasing him, pushing his hat up with his billy club.  Big eyes pointing at him.  He's running now.  He jumps up real quick and then runs.  Yeah, yeah.  He always jump up real quick and then run for some reason in those days.  They're live action cartoon people.  Is that a graph of his bad breath?  Yeah, the little real player psychedelic images.  How awful is real player?  It's like watching a laser light show from the 80s. 
[00:19:30]  Nice.  Real player is horrible.  Oh.  Who uses real player?  Nobody.  He's got a website with .rm files on it.  Steve the Whistler.  I suck.  Yes.  I whistle.  Yes, but not out of my mouth.  No.  Out of my backside.  How long is the Steve the Whistler bit, E-Rock?  It's 32 minutes.  Wow.  Fuck, man.  When was the last time you played it?  We fucked with him for a long time.  We played a lot. 
[00:20:00]  We could play it again.  When was the last time we played it, though?  I think when we did the Cringing Moments special.  Oh, really?  So, I think earlier in the year.  I think we should just, like, during the shit show, you know, the after show.  Oh, okay.  Just do what Sam normally does, where it's like, you know, Steve the Whistler, and you'll  be fucking with him, and Steve will go, whew, whew, whew.  I don't think the, whew, after opiate Anthony.  Well, that was, you know, some shit. 
[00:20:30]  It's like bits just end in the, there's no sense.  That the bit actually naturally ended.  Sometimes we get tired of the bit playing, so I just tell you, right, just throw the  sweeper.  Just throw the sweeper.  After O'Neill, Sam Roberts.  And then he's like, yeah, that was, you know, a little taste, a little taste of it.  I say this.  I laughed so hard when that happened, by the way.  It's one of my favorite parts of the after show.  After O'Neill, it's live.  It just stops.  It just stops anything. 
[00:21:00]  I say this liking, I like the after show, right?  Okay.  Who doesn't?  Do you get any feedback from those guys at all?  Any direction?  Anything?  No, no.  I mean, every now and very rarely, but air check.  Could you see if they air check them?  Yeah.  They kind of do.  As long as you guys are okay with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all right with it.  They just let me do whatever.  We called in yesterday on the way home.  We're all right with it.  Yeah.  You had some celebrity call in yesterday, though.  I love when the Club Soda Candy vehicle calls in, because it's everybody, and everybody's 
[00:21:30]  part, and sometimes Chip shows up.  Oh, yeah.  I heard yesterday.  I heard some Chip.  Yeah.  I had to drive home with Chip.  He was helping out with the text.  The entire fucking time.  Well, he didn't realize his phone was still on, and the whole time he was just saying,  I hate that E-Rock.  And he didn't bring up his phone.  Have you gotten any feedback within the past week or something from Gary or anything?  You mean this week?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gary's-  It's been a great week of O&A Radio, so I would assume that-  We have had an amazing week. 
[00:22:00]  Any feedback from Gary?  He's on vacation.  What?  What?  Yeah.  He's on vacation.  What do you mean?  I thought we talked about this yesterday and the day before.  No.  I don't remember talking about it at all, Sam.  What are you talking about?  Wait a minute.  He's not here?  Gary?  Yeah.  No.  I could have sworn I even saw him yesterday.  Yeah.  I thought I saw him, too.  Like down the hall or something.  No.  Didn't he pick his head in when Guy Fieri was cooking up those steaks?  Yeah.  No, he's not in the state.  He's out on vacation.  Well, how the fuck did we put that whole Guy Fieri thing together if he's on vacation? 
[00:22:30]  Well, I mean, we may do.  We actually have pulled off some amazing shows this week without any assistance from Gary?  Gary's on vacation this week.  But what does he do that makes us go, holy shit, Gary's on vacation.  This hasn't gotten done or we need this and I can't wait till he gets back because then  we can do this.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  No.  I mean, why didn't any of us panic?  Because he was going on vacation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would think there'd be a panic in the air like, oh, God, I don't know if we're going 
[00:23:00]  to be able to do the show.  Exactly.  Who had to step up?  Right.  To fulfill what he normally does so our show can run?  It's actually the guy who does the toilets had to step down.  The guy that's in there mopping sometimes?  No, not him.  The other guy they send in who has to use his fingernails to scrape the bottom of the ridge  of the bowl.  So you mean to tell me that we've had no interruption in any way, shape, or form to 
[00:23:30]  our show because Gary's on vacation?  Well, I'll tell you, it's been a great week of radio.  What had to be put on the back burner for a week because he's not here?  Very good.  Very good.  What was he even working on that we don't know about?  What was he working on that is now postponed for one week because he's been away?  Obviously, he's not working on your raise or getting us interns.  Right, that's true.  That's true.  What does he do?  Well, I don't know.  I'm not his direct superior or anything like that, so I don't know exactly what his response  is. 
[00:24:00]  I will say one thing that has suffered is that tube of head polish has gone untouched  in a week.  I do miss him.  I'm going to go home and watch Powder.  Yes, right now Gary's in a cafeteria somewhere explaining why all the forks are stuck to his  arm.  It must suck to be a not good looking guy and bald.  That's a horrible combination. 
[00:24:30]  At least if you're losing your hair, you can tell your family.  Like, look at my face.  I got a good face.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  Hair doesn't matter if you have a good face.  Wow.  Wait, he's really not here this week?  No, he's not.  It's a joke, right?  I'm not kidding.  I'll tell you, Rob Cross stepped up.  He led the meeting this week, the staff meeting.  Oh, now would Gary normally lead it?  Yeah.  I mean, yes.  But isn't Rob Cross an intern in the management program?  No.  Rob Cross is not an intern.  He actually has power? 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  He oversees some of the programs on this channel.  What does he oversee?  Well, he focuses more on Ron and Fez and special delivery.  Is there a show on vacation then?  No, not Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  No, Rob is here taking care of Ron and Fez.  Gary is the one who's not here.  He's really not here.  I assume because he's not here, Ron and Fez would be like, we got to take off too because  we can't function without him.  Yeah, the whole channel should shut down.  Really, yeah.  If the guy who won't that oversees the thing is on vacation, the whole fucking channel should 
[00:25:30]  shut down.  Yeah, we should power down.  No, Gary just pretty much concentrates on this show.  Yeah?  That's his main responsibility and focus.  Really?  I mean, God, I hope he doesn't tell his family and friends that.  That's what his job is, I think.  You think when he's not here, he actually tells his family and friends?  Yeah, you know, I oversee that whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I'm a very important part of that whole organization.  That's me.  Oh, I know they've been doing it for, I don't know, 20 some odd years at this point.  One of the guys has been in Radio 30.  They've been together about 17 or so, but I'm really the main fucking guy over there. 
[00:26:00]  I'm the guy.  If it wasn't for me, I think that whole show would collapse.  You think he has those conversations?  Oh, yeah.  Either those or, hey, do you know where I can get a gun?  Well, that's my goal.  That's your goal?  Oh, God.  What?  That's a horrible thing to say.  What happened?  He said, either that or get a gun, and you said, that's my goal.  I want to get a gun.  Oh.  Well, who wouldn't?  It's not safe out there, Sam.  What are you talking about?  It is very unsafe out there. 
[00:26:30]  It's my mistake.  Yeah.  My mistake!  So when is he back from vacation?  I think he's just gone for the week, and he'll be back on Monday refreshed.  Honestly, I'll tell you the truth.  Okay.  He knows he's not that important, so that's why he takes his vacation whenever.  Like, if it was really important, he would take his vacation when we take our vacation.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean, he's got other responsibilities here as well.  What are some of his other responsibilities at SiriusXM?  I know he does.  Because maybe he could just do all that.  Besides this show, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Maybe he could do all that full time.  We could give him some extra time.  Because I honestly think at this point, we'd be better off without him.  Oh, my God.  If you want to make it really real.  The show's functioning perfectly without him.  Well, yeah, but I mean, people are stepping up.  Yeah, maybe as time went on.  Who's stepping up?  Well, Rob ran the meeting.  I like Rob.  He's a good guy.  After his internship, I think he could get a low-level job in management.  You're not listening.  I told you he's not an intern.  He's an intern in that program.  He's not an intern. 
[00:27:30]  You can't just become a manager.  They fucking bring you up.  He has a desk.  You start by getting coffee for, like, I don't know, Bladder and Greenstein.  No, eventually they give you a little low-level fucking management job.  I look forward to that day for him.  He has a desk, and he's got office space.  What does Gary do?  Gary, he runs, I'm not sure exactly.  Because I know when I have real issues, I just go right to Bladder.  Okay.  Is this the week he had to go to DeVry to get his diploma?  I think he graduated from a college that wasn't DeVry. 
[00:28:00]  I'm not sure which school.  Oh, okay.  I can't be.  No, he does run a couple music channels.  He's in charge of this show.  He does a whole bunch of music channels.  Come on, in charge of this show.  In charge of the show.  Shut that shit up right away.  Oh, man.  I'm not going to allow that.  He can make believe he kind of oversees this shit.  That's fine.  He's not in charge of me, Anthony, or Jim Norton.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  I've gotten to him when I have problems.  Oh, they call him Spit Shine Gary. 
[00:28:30]  His head looks like fucking mirrors.  You see yourself in him.  Head like fucking mirrors.  Well, that's not a commentary on his managerial style.  All right, so he's on vacation, I guess.  Yes, I guess.  I could swear I at least saw him, but maybe the back of his head.  This is one of those when a tree falls in the woods thing.  Like, I don't know if he's really on vacation, because I wouldn't know on a regular basis when he's here. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  The only time I know he's here is when he's trying to corner me for some nonsense.  Which is, well, whatever.  It's always nonsense.  I know for a fact he's on vacation, and I'm looking forward to him coming back.  Get some more stuff done.  All right.  Fair enough.  He's a behind-the-scenes guy.  You guys are more focused with on the air.  Behind the scenes?  What happens back there?  I want to ask the entire staff.  No, don't ask everybody.  And you can even write it on a piece of paper to keep it very, you know, anonymous. 
[00:29:30]  What was the last thing he did for the show?  I really want to know.  Something that we would know about.  Yes, write it down.  Because if I had to, if I had to, I wouldn't be able to come up with anything.  Let me tell you what I'm seeing right now.  There is somebody, I'm not going to give away any names, who couldn't grab a pen and paper fast enough, could not grab a pen and paper fast enough, and is jotting down furiously.  It's a food order. 
[00:30:00]  Okay, you gave it away.  Well, maybe we're throwing people off, Sam.  You never know.  You never know.  He's right.  He's still writing.  Because I wouldn't be able to answer that question.  Would you be able to answer that question?  Last thing.  He did for the show.  He probably told me something on the way to the elevator, but I don't remember.  He was helpful.  He was a point guy for me when organizing the Comic Con trip.  Oh.  He did do that. 
[00:30:30]  He was a point guy.  Yeah, but you could get a travel agent for that.  I could call a travel agency, and they could do exactly what he did.  You could do it online.  Yourself.  Right.  Just plink away at some keys.  You got a trip.  I did.  He approved.  He approved everything, and that's what I mean.  And I told someone this yesterday.  The mistake Gary made was telling me that we were making progress on interns, so now I'm done with him.  The mistake Gary made was saying, okay, I'll take the job.  Well, that's his mistake.  But when he said we're making progress on interns, and that was at least four to five months ago, I'm like, I'm done with this guy. 
[00:31:00]  It was so long ago.  Maybe he's working on it, and it's out of his control.  Well, then don't tell me you're making progress.  Do we have an answer to the question?  Okay.  This is what he does, as per someone.  Keeps pursuing events you say no to a long time ago, and tells us not to talk about it, because he's handling it. 
[00:31:30]  So shit we've said no to continues to be pursued, and then tells us not to talk about it, because hey, he's on it.  He's on it.  He's on it.  He's on it.  Rip that up.  What are they going to do, handwriting?  No, no, give me that.  You can't check hoof prints.  I don't trust this place at all.  I'll put it in my back pocket and dispose of it properly.  Hilarious.  All right.  Here it is. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, Denver Pest saying, Gary is every middle manager in America.  Thank you.  And that's why we do this.  It's middle management.  We do this because people can relate, and then we get kind of bitched at.  Yeah.  Oh, man, you know.  But this is why we do it.  Everyone deals with this shit.  Middle management sucks a dick.  Gary's going to be like, oh, they started the show.  Oh, listen, Steve the Whistler, they're bashing him.  Good, I'm in the clear.  Did that make a left turn?  Yeah, man, it's shop right. 
[00:32:30]  Left.  If I was him, I would quit with dignity.  How's that?  Just tell the company, look, I'm more suited.  Wait, private pile left the ring.  Yeah, exactly.  And just say I'm more suited for, like, music channels.  They're right.  They don't need me.  I was hoping they did, but they just don't.  Yeah.  That's a shiny head.  He works with the staff more than, you know. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah?  He works more closely with the staff, I guess, than you guys.  Ah.  So, again, aside from pursuing shit that we know about, too, what to, oh, I know, you didn't say that.  What does he do behind the scenes?  Well, like, he's a point guy on big events, like things like Comic-Con,  I don't know when we have to.  Sam, don't talk and hit buttons while you're talking.  I don't have buttons.  Was he at the Hard Rock Cafe? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, he was there.  He was there.  He was banging cocktail wings with two at a time.  I don't know if that's true.  Wow, was that good timing?  I love when a button's just sitting there.  Oh, my God.  Glowing.  Be honest now.  Yeah.  Do you remember seeing him at the Hard Rock Cafe?  Because he was the point man.  No.  Are you being honest?  I'm being honest with you. 
[00:34:00]  I know that there were walkthroughs of the Hard Rock leading up to the event that he went on.  Well, I know the broadcast sounded terrific.  Wow.  Wow.  One of our best remotes ever.  Yeah.  Oh, is that good?  Mm-hmm.  He was at the Hard Rock.  He was banging cocktail wings with two at a time.  Idiot.  You picture that Dunderhead fucking Hard Rock girls?  Yep.  But we walk in here.  Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da. 
[00:34:30]  I'm all green.  That's funny.  I think a lot of companies would do well just getting rid of middle management.  Yeah.  You've got the money you could save.  And then pass the savings on to the workers.  And then you know what you do?  You get rid of middle management.  Mm-hmm.  You do that for like a month.  And then you assess what is getting done and what isn't getting done.  And then you perhaps even rehire a couple for the positions that weren't getting done. 
[00:35:00]  Mm-hmm.  For things that weren't getting done.  But you would never have to rehire them all.  That's for sure.  Oh, fuck no.  It would be a very small percentage.  Fuck no.  Because you'd be like, are things getting done?  Oh, yeah.  Well, really?  You laid them off for a little while?  When is Rob Cross's internship over?  I goddamn told you this.  I goddamn told you this, he says.  He's not an intern.  Are we going to throw him a party?  He runs XMU.  We should take him out after his internship's done.  Because I kind of like the guy. 
[00:35:30]  When's his semester up?  I think it's a summer internship for him.  Oh, it's summer?  No, I told you this.  He's been here since we first got here.  He runs some of the programming on this channel.  What programming?  I love this vague, some of the programming.  Everything's so vague.  He runs some music channels.  It's all, I don't know.  Rob is in charge of XMU, and he does a great job on that.  That's college radio, isn't it?  XMU.  That's XM's version of college radio.  All right, Ant. 
[00:36:00]  It's indie.  Ant.  Hold on.  It's supposed to be college radio.  Hence the U.  I got another question for Anthony.  XMU.  Ready?  Yeah.  And we came from the XM world.  Yes.  I'm going to give you five guesses to try to figure out what channel that is.  And you work for the company.  All right.  This is like a lotto.  It is lotto.  So you're openly admitting you're just going to take a complete stab at this.  XM93.  All right.  93.  What's on 93? 
[00:36:30]  There's three guesses, right?  Five.  Hang on.  No, let's go with three.  Okay.  Three is good enough.  I'm not looking at anything.  XM65.  93, 65.  Okay.  XM.  No, no.  It's out of the 20.  XM.  57.  57.  Because this leads to .2.  And now we'll go.  A lot of these channels can be turned off.  Two more.  Let's just say XM. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  130.  130.  130.  130.  And then we'll go with the last one.  We'll go XM.  You got a lot of high numbers here.  You want to go a little lower?  No, I know the lower ones.  It wouldn't be there.  Okay, fair enough.  All right.  I'm going to go 116.  116.  Okay.  I'll go 117.  Price is right, bitch.  We could turn some of these channels off. 
[00:37:30]  I think it's time that we get a second channel.  And then we throw a lot of our guys on that second channel.  It'll do way the fuck better than a lot of these other dumb things.  What is it?  I don't think there is an XM 93.  That was your first guess.  Okay.  Second guess, XM 65 is old school hip hop backspin.  Ah, that's 65.  I must have, because I was just listening to that.  Backspin is kind of cool.  Is it?  Yeah, it's not bad.  Like the good old days?  Yeah.  Seemed less threatening.  Yeah, when rap was fun. 
[00:38:00]  Rap was fun.  When rap was fun.  Hip hop.  Hip hop.  Hip hop.  Hip hop.  Hip hop.  You don't stop a rockin.  I got my hat and it matches my collar.  It's different than now.  Oh, yeah.  Much less threatening.  XM 57 is the Grateful Dead channel.  Oh.  I should have known that one.  XM 130 is POTUS.  POTUS.  POTUS.  That was Hugh Pinero's idea.  That's POTUS to sleep.  That was Hugh Pinero's only idea that he ever came up with. 
[00:38:30]  And it should have been Gingivitis.  And XM 116 is Kid's Place.  Oh, see?  I should have known.  So you weren't even close.  No.  Kevin from Connecticut, it's 35.  Is it?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  According to you, you knew all the lower ones.  Well, I was thinking like 20s and stuff.  Now, Sam goes, he does a good job programming XM 35.  Yes, he does.  What makes a good job in that case?  The listeners of Sirius XMU are all happy with the way the station sounds. 
[00:39:00]  To my knowledge.  So the listener...  And he gets banned.  The listener of XMU really likes it?  I said listeners.  Oh.  I just heard one.  And he's had people up here.  He's done events with, you know, interviews.  And the Antlers were up here.  Really?  MGMT.  Well, I like MGMT.  That's for sure.  Well.  But they're heard on other channels, right? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  The Antlers aren't.  Who are the Antlers?  They're an indie band.  We're not hip enough to know the Antlers.  That sucks.  They were on Leno.  They were?  What's their song?  Do I know their song?  Probably not.  Do they sing with the Unclas?  No.  It's not good.  Antler.  Antler.  Like an animal.  So he does a good job with that.  All right.  And he focuses more on the Ron and Fez show and special delivery.  He does a great job with special delivery. 
[00:40:00]  I want to make a request to the company right now.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  We want a second channel.  Because a lot of these channels are nonsense.  Let's be honest with each other.  Yeah.  We could just knock that off.  Give us another channel.  We'll move some of our boys in.  And I think you would have a fine fucking channel.  Oh, I think so.  Think podcast.  What are you taking off?  Huh?  What channel are you replacing?  XMU.  XMU is easy.  No.  That's Rob's channel.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  Why don't you?  People like XMU.  Isn't it just college radio?  So tune in 89 point something and you'll get the same music. 
[00:40:30]  It's indie rock.  Huh?  Indie rock.  What's indie rock?  Independent.  Because I like rock and roll.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  No, no.  No, it's some Indianapolis, stupid.  Oh, sorry.  I missed that.  Neither of those two.  I want to congratulate Green Day.  Voted the greatest punk band of all time.  Really?  Punk?  What?  Exactly.  They couldn't be more mainstream.  Who the fuck voted for them?  I think it was Rolling Stone had a huge fucking poll.  Well, Rolling Stone stinks. 
[00:41:00]  But you can't have Green Day as a punk band.  Maybe they sort of started like that.  I don't know.  I remember as soon as Green Day hit, they were mainstream right away.  Yeah.  Right away.  What's a Green Day punk song?  Do they even have punk elements?  Dude, I can't think of one punk vibe I've ever heard from those guys.  No, they're catchy, poppy tunes.  They're extremely catchy.  Yeah.  They know how to write pop music.  The Clash.  Where's the Sex Pistols?  Oh, wait.  Is this the list?  Number four.  All right.  So let me go down the list.  Is this from Rolling Stone? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Oh, Travis wants in on this too.  Good.  Bad Brains should be on the list.  Social Distortion should be on the list.  The Misfits absolutely should be on the list.  Black Flag.  Number seven, Black Flag on the list.  Six, Iggy and the Stooges.  These are punk rock bands.  Six.  Five, Dead Kennedys.  Yes.  Four, Sex Pistols.  Yes.  The Ramones, of course.  At number three, The Clash.  I have...  They wound up getting popular, but they got popular as a punk band. 
[00:42:00]  Were they really?  They were considered punk, but...  Who?  The Clash.  The Clash.  The Clash.  Absolutely.  But they got poppy.  They certainly had a lot of poppy stuff.  Did you play a little Clash, E-Rock?  Oh, my God.  Go with fucking Lost in the Supermarket or...  Well, Trader Bane is popular.  I'm sure he was going to go with...  What were you going to go with, E-Rock?  Lost in the Supermarket.  That's his dream.  Yeah, he was going to go with Rock the Casbah.  No, you can't go with Rock the Casbah.  Actually, I was wrong too.  That's them?  Rock the Casbah?  Is that punk?  Actually, I was wrong too.  You got to go earlier to prove that they're punk. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Because Lost in the Supermarket is just a nice song.  Why did I scream that?  There's no punk elements whatsoever.  Yeah, Rock the Casbah.  You were going to play Rock the Casbah.  No, I was not.  Yeah.  That's what you were going to play Rock the Casbah.  I'm going to play Rock the Casbah.  What about Should I Stay or Should I Go?  Those are all the songs.  It's always Tase, Tase, Tase.  I think it's just the way they sing that make them punk.  That's not a punk song either.  You've got me, as long as you sound like you're Cockney.  Yeah.  No, The Clash and Joe Strummer were definitely... 
[00:43:00]  But where...  I haven't heard of punk...  The ones you're naming, Rock the Casbah, Should I Stay or Should I Go?  Give me a list of The Clash songs and we'll do it for you, Rock.  You're picking all their biggest hits.  We should play one that we haven't named yet to see what he would play.  Yeah.  That's true.  What would you play?  Okay.  And it's really hip to fucking like the Clash.  He's reading the list.  I'll tell you what he's doing right now.  He's reading the list trying to find the title of the song.  That sounds punky.  That sounds punky.  Hey, this is cool.  Boots in the face.  I'll play that.  The one I like isn't in here, so... 
[00:43:30]  What song?  Guns of Brixton?  Yeah.  That's not in here.  That's a good song.  I would go London Calling.  London Calling.  London Calling.  It's a song that people know and it sort of has some punk elements.  Phony Peter Mania has been in the dust.  I would go with this one.  You've got to just sound angry.  This would be the one that keeps everyone interested.  A song you know and it's sort of punky.  This was the intro music to my college radio punk show.  Ah, nice.  So I can confirm that this is punk.  Wow.  What was it called?  The Twink Punk?  Was that your decision or Rob's? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, that was Rob's.  There's no way he was the program director for that.  I don't know what he did.  I just played this on the Boneyard, actually.  It's a great song.  Yeah.  The boys and girls.  The boys and girls.  Now don't look to us.  Phony Peter Mania.  They put these guys in one of the fucking Sex Pistols, though.  Well, I mean, the Sex Pistols had one album.  Okay. 
[00:44:30]  They were more famous for their act than they were for their music.  I liked The Clash.  I really liked The Clash.  Back in the day.  I still like them.  And then Green Day is your number one punk band of all time.  Green Day beats out all those as a punk band.  Now you want to know why?  If I was that midget that sings for them, I would tell everyone, look, I just want to  tell the world, we're not a punk band.  Thank you for considering us one, but we're just not.  We're on fucking Broadway, and we had, well, it used to be on Broadway, and we came up with 
[00:45:00]  a million poppy hit songs.  And had like a ballad that was played at funerals and shit.  I can't listen to that one.  What song is that?  Jesus.  I can't even listen to that one.  That's that ballad.  We went down that road.  What?  Time of your life.  They did a good version, a good cover of Working Class Hero.  Yeah, they did.  Which I heard a Bobby Fischer tribute after he died.  That's how I heard of their...  They have a great cover of this.  I like them a lot, but they're not punk.  Well, then they probably shouldn't have posted the link to vote on their own website. 
[00:45:30]  Of course they shouldn't have.  They should have respect for themselves and tell the community, we're not a punk band.  Is that what happened?  Yeah, this was a reader's poll, and like the biggest Green Day fan site and their official  website both posted about it.  Okay, so that's what happened.  You can't really...  I don't think Iggy and the Stooges are getting a website and I'm putting a link up.  I really wanted to win the contest.  Fucking assholes.  Because Rolling Stone knows what punk rock is. 
[00:46:00]  This is a great song, by the way.  Yeah.  Not that I have to tell anyone.  They hit you at home and they hit you at school.  He almost sounds like one in there, huh?  A little bit.  They hate if you're clever and defy.  I think he's starring in the American Idiot movie that they're doing.  Oh, John Lennon?  No, Billy John.  Billy John Lennon.  Want to go to break with us?  Nah, turn us up.  We'll be back.  I gotta eat.  Working class hero is something to be in. 
[00:46:30]  Working class hero is something to be in.  When they tortured and scared you for 20 odd years.  Then they expect you to pick a career.  When you can't really function, you're so full of fear. 
[00:47:00]  Working class hero is something to be in.  A working class hero is something to be in.  You're a doctor to religion and sex and TV in.  And you think you're so clever and classless and free in. 
[00:47:30]  But you're still a person.  But you're still a person.  But you're still a person.  As far as I can see.  A working class hero is something to be in.  A working class hero is something to be in.  This room at the top, they're telling you still. 
[00:48:00]  A working class hero is something to be in. 
[00:48:30]  If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me. 
[00:49:00]  If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me.  The Opie and Anthony Show, on the virus, Sirius XM. 
[00:49:30]  That gets all surfer guitar sounding.  It's Billy Bob Thornton's birthday today. 
[00:50:00]  That's why.  Wow, good one.  56 years young today.  You gotta play through it.  You gotta play through it.  More birthdays.  Richard Bilzer, 67.  Wow.  Is he really?  Barack Obama, the big 5-0 today.  Yeah, he was joking about it on the TV.  Yeah, I guess the country's fine.  When I see the president making jokes, I say to myself, ah, the country's fine.  You feel better about everything? 
[00:50:30]  Of course.  They were talking about how America was going to collapse a mere week ago,  and now you've got the president on TV making jokes.  Making some jokes.  Everything's fine.  Any movie you see where the president is dealing with turmoil and a horrible situation,  they're never joking.  Yeah.  You know?  Watch Armageddon.  Yeah.  The president's not joking in that, motherfucker.  Roger Clemens, 49 years old.  Oh.  The rocket.  And on a personal note, my dad would have been 81 today. 
[00:51:00]  Oh.  Oh, well, you know.  It's the circle of life, Opie.  The circle.  80 fucking one.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's old.  That's doable, though.  Yes.  Tony Bennett just turned 85.  He's rocking.  Tony Bennett.  81.  Fuck.  And here's one that's going to make a few of you feel very old today. 
[00:51:30]  And now, it's a new bit, by the way.  How old was Travis when blank happened is the new bit.  We just started it today.  Yeah.  Travis was, I got to do the math.  Two years old.  Carrie.  Travis was two years old when this happened.  Two years old.  His mom left with a Jew.  No?  He was older. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  The first time he kicked his underwear onto a ceiling fan.  Nice.  Travis is 30.  So 28 years ago.  So he was two years old when this happened.  All right.  Wait.  What year is it?  This is a much better way to do this bit that we've been doing for a while now.  Yes.  Travis was two.  And he's one of the big fucking producers for this radio show now.  Two.  83, that was.  Wow.  Yeah.  Travis was two.  So he has no memory of this happening.  And we certainly have a vivid memory of this happening. 
[00:52:30]  It's a sports memory.  Oh, wait.  83.  Mm-hmm.  Did the guy kick the goal?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Do you know when your dad's birthday is?  Yeah, December 28th.  Reagan was shot.  28th.  Yeah.  July 29th.  I don't think I ever knew that.  Hmm.  Reagan was shot 28 years ago today?  No, I'm just guessing.  What?  It's a sports, uh, hello.  It's a sports, I'm sorry.  Oh, you just tricked me. 
[00:53:00]  It was a hell of a sport.  Yeah.  Well, for Hinkley, it was.  Caught a bullet with his lung.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, that was actually a good, it was a good rebound one  for him to, if Brady was passed.  Um, the sport thing, 28 years ago.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Uh.  Robin Yount hit a double.  Oh, very good.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Um, Alan Bannister grounded.  By the way, when I was, 1979, the top, it's the only baseball card collection I ever collected 
[00:53:30]  the entire one through just buying packs and got it.  Oh.  And my friend, Neil Grant, I couldn't get Alan Bannister from the Chicago White Sox.  It was the last one in the cunting series.  And then Neil Grant had it and traded me for something.  And he brought it in tinfoil.  And I got my Alan Bannister card.  In tinfoil.  But it was okay.  He was in good shape.  Nice.  Yeah, I just wanted to get a really, really awful story.  I like it.  28 years ago today, Travis was two.  Dave Winfield killed a seagull. 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  That's a while ago.  A seagull.  Winfield killed a seagull.  And Travis's mom fucked one.  A seagull?  Oh, shit.  And 67 years ago today, Anne Frank lost her game of hide and seek.  Okay.  She was arrested by the Nazis. 
[00:54:30]  Ali Ali Oxenfleet.  The Nazis got answers.  Oh, they came out.  Was that three weeks before the end of the war or something they got her?  It was really right before the end of World War II.  Who's the landlord of that building that she was hiding in?  Because now the poor landlord can't fucking change that building ever.  Oh, yeah, right?  Maybe he wants to remodel or something.  Yeah, there's something in the attic.  Put AC up there.  They're making it into a really nice condo with a lot of windows and stuff.  By the way, Anthony.  Yes. 
[00:55:00]  All the punk people are checking in, and I think they're making some really good points.  They are mentioning bands I've never fucking heard of in my life.  Well, those are probably good punk bands.  And we've been in the music world off and on our entire lives, right?  So I think Rolling Stone's list, you pretty much have to get rid of that entire list.  Yeah.  Because those are mainstream punk bands.  Popularity contest.  And you can't really say punk and mainstream at the same time.  So I bet you, if I was Rolling Stone, I would go, okay, this list was nice, but now we're  going to do a real fucking list of punk bands. 
[00:55:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So what is, who are they saying?  Like the Voidoids?  Exactly.  The Voidoids.  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of them coming in that's going to just bore everyone to death.  But those are probably real punk bands that people in the know, you know, understand and like.  What about Gigi Allen?  He just threw shit around.  He was terrible.  No, he was horrid.  The Murder Junkies?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Hey, we're just. 
[00:56:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, duty on you.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We got it.  Crazy.  He was crazy, but.  I like watching Gigi Allen documentaries and stuff.  Yeah.  He didn't.  Pissing on the audience.  Do it.  Shitting.  Well, he was respectful of Johnny Cash.  Was he?  Worshipped Johnny Cash.  And when they met, I don't think he met Johnny Cash, but they went to a Johnny Cash show.  And he was very well behaved.  Really?  And then he met somebody in Cash's family.  Might have been his daughter.  Mm-hmm.  Or whatever.  And he was very gentlemanly.  Hey, uh.  He's got no penis. 
[00:56:30]  Did he ever do a Johnny Cash song, GGL?  I don't know.  How could you know?  Yeah, burn a ring of fire, burn a ring of shit on fire, burn a fire, burn a fire.  That's good.  Attack your own audience with feces.  Terrific.  And wonder why they don't come back.  Exactly.  Why would they?  They were in a warehouse performing.  Right.  Your shows have to be on the QT.  That's great.  My friend Elizabeth was good friends with Merle.  Yeah.  Merle with the backwards Hitler.  Yeah.  He sported.  Oh, yeah.  He did.  He went backwards Hitler. 
[00:57:00]  Gigi's covered in blood and shit and what a disaster.  The buzzcocks.  Ah, the buzzcocks.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Stupid Al Sharpton.  You want to get into this shit or what?  Of course.  Do you have parties for your birthday when you turn a certain age?  Me?  Yeah, I don't.  An actual party?  Yeah, I don't.  No, but it's, you know, it's...  It's depressing, right?  No. 
[00:57:30]  Not anymore.  Oh.  It was depressing when I was in a dead-end relationship with nothing fucking going on in my life.  Yeah, you just kind of get like...  And now that I got stuff going on, it's kind of cool again.  Birthdays?  Yeah.  You're all right, man.  I never had them.  No, I'm not a party guy, like a birthday party guy.  What kind of party do you want?  I'll have a shindig.  But it won't be like your typical fucking happy birthday.  Are you in a relationship now, Jimmy?  No.  I think it makes it tougher when you're a little older and you're not in a relationship  and you have a birthday.  I just realized...  To be completely honest with you. 
[00:58:00]  But my ex and I are still friends and, you know, I don't know where it will go, but  we've been broken for almost four months.  Damn.  I can't fucking believe that.  Wow.  Time does go by.  I can't believe that.  I just realized it last night.  But yeah, I never throw birthday parties because I would never know who to invite.  No, you just maybe get some people together.  Yeah, of course.  Party hats.  Oh, party hats.  I'm waiting for something to happen. 
[00:58:30]  It might not happen, though.  Really?  No.  No?  Okay.  That's all.  I saw Vos last night.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Vos is coming in.  He is.  He brought me a Phil Necro ball signed.  He got it signed.  Did he?  He's a good guy.  How does he know it was Phil Necro?  He probably mispronounced it and had to be corrected, and that's how I remember.  Phil Necro.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Or Philip Necro.  Philip Necro.  My dad does not leave me pennies in the street.  A lot of people are asking. 
[00:59:00]  What?  Oh.  It's a question, Sam.  Oh.  That's...  But my dad did flick the lights.  What day was that?  A couple weeks ago.  Actually, it might have been a combo of me and Ant's dead dad's fucking lights.  The power.  And by the way, the lights haven't flickered since, and Sam witnessed that shit.  That is odd, right?  Right when I was about to mock the dead and how, see, they can't give a sign.  All of a sudden, these lights went fucking dim and back up.  And you said...  I mean, you said...  Yes.  If you're around, if you have this power, make the lights flicker. 
[00:59:30]  Look, it's a big day for my dad in heaven.  He's 81 today, so fucking show me another sign, motherfucker.  Oh, boy.  Another.  Prove to me...  He showed you a sign.  Prove to me that was just one of those things that was a coincidence.  How can you have so little faith?  You need another sign two weeks later?  Why not?  If you can do it once, you can do it a hundred times, right?  We dimmed the light, and then he flicked it back on.  Huh?  We dimmed the light.  Well, no, I don't want to fuck around with what we did last time.  Because maybe if we dim the lights, that's why it happens. 
[01:00:00]  So just do it.  Yeah, now you just gotta say...  Do it!  Do it!  Go ahead.  Do it!  Go ahead.  If you're hanging around...  Go ahead.  Make the lights do anything.  Stop fingering Marilyn Monroe and flick these fucking lights.  Yeah, maybe it's like...  Oh, kid, put these fucking lights again.  Jesus.  I gave him a sign.  I was proud of my dad when I...  I was coming of age, you know, that 13, 14, 15, and you start snooping around a little  bit in the house.  Found a trunk of my dad's, and there was nudes of Marilyn Monroe. 
[01:00:30]  I'm like, my dad jerks off to Marilyn Monroe nudes.  Oh, Jesus.  It was the greatest find ever.  It just meant so much to me.  Because he wasn't a Playboy guy.  I don't think my mom would have allowed him to have a subscription to Playboy.  We're waiting, Sam.  No lights flickering today.  Yeah, I don't see anything.  Yeah, but like you said...  On his birthday, too.  We may be busy.  On his birthday.  They're just having fun.  Yeah.  You think our pops are hanging out? 
[01:01:00]  Who knows?  Is there a bar up there?  Well, my dad's way cooler than me, so I would imagine there's a very good possibility of that,  sir.  As long as...  Yeah.  As long as there's a place to get a beverage.  Yeah.  All right.  We can't wait for the fucking lights to flicker.  Yeah, yeah.  So we're going to move on.  Is that okay with you?  So, yeah, it's okay by me.  Let your dad rest in peace.  Why, man?  It's his birthday.  Fuck it.  Flick these goddamn lights.  Party.  Yeah.  Party.  Who do you invite?  Yeah.  All his friends.  I'm going to wait for something to happen again. 
[01:01:30]  Nothing's going to happen.  Nothing?  I actually don't care.  Should I wait?  Nothing.  I'm waiting for something to happen.  Sometimes you've got to wait and let something develop.  Nothing?  Nothing.  No, because I wouldn't have went anywhere.  I really wouldn't have.  I wouldn't have done my spot and went home.  I don't care if he's a fan of the show.  All right.  Well, dad's not going to flick the lights today for his 81st birthday.  He can make believe he's blowing on candles.  Fucking make these things flick.  See, it was nothing that day, Sam. 
[01:02:00]  It was just a coincidence.  No, he probably gets up to listen to the show.  Oh.  In heaven.  Yeah, but he's got a replay in heaven.  He does?  Yeah, it replaced her at the day.  Nice.  Reverend Al Sharpton's an asshole.  Yeah.  He's playing that damn race card once again.  He loves playing the race card.  No surprise here.  Does he have his own show now?  Yeah.  Like every night? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Every day or whatever?  Is it?  Where's he on?  CNN?  I think it's MSNBC.  I want to see MSNBC.  Of course.  Why wouldn't they put him on?  Wow.  What did MSNBC do wrong that they had to hire Reverend Al?  Because Reverend Al holds people hostage.  Yeah, that's how Reverend Al gets jobs.  He got a gig.  Through an extortion pretty much.  I don't give a fuck anymore so we can finally say it.  Reverend Al was hired by XM because of a problem we had.  Yeah.  And that was the way to calm Reverend Al down because he was rallying the troops against this radio show for a bit we did. 
[01:03:00]  The Homeless Charlie thing.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden they said, well, we want to give you a show, Reverend Al, but you can't really mess with our main guys here.  So they made some backdoor deal.  That's how Reverend Al gets fucking shows.  Of course.  So I wonder if MSNBC had a little problem with Reverend Al and they had to smooth it over by getting his dumb face on TV.  Reverend Al.  So what did he do, Ant?  Well, there was a problem with Pat Buchanan. 
[01:03:30]  He was having a conversation with Pat Buchanan.  And Pat said something about President Obama and said, hey, your boy Obama caved in.  You know, he caved to the Republicans for this debt bullshit thing.  And he goes, what?  And I was like, what?  He goes, my president? 
[01:04:00]  Is that who you're talking about?  My president?  Your president?  He goes, what?  Your boy caved.  So that's what he's now demanding an apology from Pat Buchanan.  Buchanan is saying there's no way he's apologizing.  He shouldn't.  He almost did.  I mean, he did a retraction type of thing.  He didn't quite apologize.  Well, he said, perhaps I could have used better words or something.  He shouldn't have even said that. 
[01:04:30]  He shouldn't have said that.  You could say boy without meaning anything past that.  I think he could.  This is one of those weird things where I don't think you should be penalized at all because  I don't think he meant anything by it.  But it's like one of those things where you go like, eh, sometimes you phrase things and  you go like, eh, I could have phrased that a little better.  And it should end there without a penalty and without a groveling apology.  Well, they want him, uh, fired.  Who does?  Uh, them.  You know.  How does Sharpton ask anybody to change anything they say when he, when he, why, why was that 
[01:05:00]  indicative of Pat Buchanan?  But when fucking Jesse Jackson said nigger on Fox, Sharpton goes, well, that's not the  Jesse I know.  And they should cut his balls off.  Everybody shut their fucking mouths.  He said cut his balls off.  Yeah, why didn't he say that?  That's your, that's your future president.  Was that before or after he was elected?  Um, I think it was after.  So why didn't, why didn't Sharpton say, I don't know if that was before or after, uh, that's  your, uh, that's your president or that's your, uh, president elect.  Yeah.  When he goes, uh, he's talking down to niggers. 
[01:05:30]  He didn't, he didn't call him a nigger.  I'm sorry.  He said that he's talking down to niggers.  Yeah.  We should cut his balls off.  They should cut, someone should cut his balls off or whatever.  Why didn't he say that?  That's your president.  Yeah.  Cause he's black.  Cause they're both black.  That's how that works.  And don't you use the term boy?  Uh, that's my boy.  I've said it before.  Like, ah, I see your boy over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your boy over there.  I've said that a million fucking times and it had nothing to do with color.  Yeah.  But it's so derogatory.  I think we should just call it the B word.  Yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, wow.  It's all over the place.  There's papi cow.  He's got legs.  Oh, fuck this Reverend Al Sharpton enough already.  Look at his scowl.  Oh, are you mad at something?  Al's very angry.  No, why?  Because it's good for business.  Didn't you see Al in first class?  I sat literally right behind him.  First class.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And believe me.  That's how Al travels.  He doesn't even have a job.  That American Airlines flight that I was on.  He doesn't have a real job.  Yeah.  That fucking, I know the network gets a deal, so maybe whoever flew him out there gets a deal.  That's an extremely expensive flight if you're going on regular. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  I imagine the network pays a third of what he would have had to pay.  Here's Pat referring to Obama.  This is how it went down.  And you got your senators fighting for their lives up there trying to raise taxes on everybody that's making more than $200,000 a year.  I'll take that fight any day.  And let me tell you, your boy, Barack Obama, caved in on it in 2010, and he'll cave in on it again. 
[01:07:00]  My what?  My president, Barack Obama, what did you say?  He's your boy in the ring.  No, he's nobody's boy.  He's your president, and he's our president, and that's what y'all are going to get through your head.  And maybe there was, you know, there was a strategy when I was a younger man.  I was never nobody's boy.  But when I was a younger man.  All right, let me say this.  Reverend L. has every right to, you know, correct him, say you're president, but that's where it should end.  Stop making more of an issue of it.  Yeah.  Sharpton is a twat. 
[01:07:30]  I wish it was somebody other than him.  But Buchanan, it's almost like doing one of those things like, again, there should be no penalty for it.  But he knows why that's like one of those things that someone would go, huh?  It's like, you know.  Yeah, but that's where it should just fucking end.  Agreed.  It's like if you're talking, literally.  If you're corrected, Pap, you can.  You say, look, he's your president.  Right.  And all that crap.  He's basically saying, give him a little respect because he is your president.  But, you know, that's where it's, that should have been the end.  Don't use a term that has typically been described as, you know, in a racially derogatory. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Eh.  But it should end there.  But now it should be dropped.  So if you're talking to a bunch of Jews and you say Holocaust, like in a context where you don't have to say it, like, oh, my God, it was, you know, it was a, we killed all the flies.  It was a fly Holocaust.  And the Jews that you sit with would go like, eh.  All right.  Technically, you can say that.  But could you, eh.  You know what I mean?  It's almost like, yeah.  Why?  It was.  It was a Holocaust of flies.  All right. 
[01:08:30]  But you understand why that's irritating.  Well, I'm sure Pat Buchanan would like to weigh in.  Okay.  So then Pat Buchanan, I like that he doesn't back down.  And he went on The Morning Jew to discuss this.  Well, I'm sure Pat Buchanan would like to weigh in.  Pat, good morning.  Morning, Amika.  First, before I weigh in on what Mark said, let me clarify something that happened last night on the Al Sharpton show, a very spirited discussion.  I was asked who was the big losers in these battles and the big winners.  And I said, one of the big losers, using boxing terminology, was your boy. 
[01:09:00]  And I meant the President of the United States.  Reverend Sharpton said, my boy is the President of the United States.  And he's doing a rope-a-dope in the Ali fashion.  And he's going to finish off your crowd.  Now, this was taken.  Some folks took what I said as some kind of slur.  None was meant.  None was intended.  None was delivered for the record.  Now, let me talk to Mark's point very briefly.  Bravo.  That's how you handle it, by the way.  And now, enough.  Just stop.  Yeah, because that sound bite is right there. 
[01:09:30]  Everything you need is in that.  You know what really does it, though?  When you listen to the clip, the way he says boy isn't just boy.  Right.  Boy, he goes, your boy.  Yeah.  He's got the accent.  You know, your boy.  Yeah.  Hey, boy.  I could see where Reverend Al would be bothered by that.  Absolutely.  But, you know, now when Reverend Al will ride this, because it's good for Reverend Al's 
[01:10:00]  business to just keep going with this shit.  It's almost like, as dishonest as it is for Al Sharpton to continue with it, it would be  dishonest to go, why would a black guy mind if you call him boy?  Like, everybody kind of knows why that's one that people would be fucking a little annoyed  with.  Agreed.  And he did say something else that he caught flack for a few months ago.  He said something like, we're going to nail the coonskin to the wall, which I guess is  a, it's kind of a country thing to say. 
[01:10:30]  It's not, again, not a racist thing to say, but.  He's not stupid enough to not know why that would be misinterpreted.  It's almost like, when you were a kid, would you ever try to get away with cursing or say  things that sounded like cursing?  It's almost like a Tourette's syndrome thing.  Like, where I would say, if I wanted to say fuck when I was a kid, I would go, oh, shucks.  Because it sounded like fuck.  It's like, it was really weird.  Like, it was the same thing, but it was slightly different.  So it's fulfilling a, a certain, a pleasurable verbal thing, or I don't know, that's. 
[01:11:00]  Well, another politician called him, called the president a tar baby, which is technically  some sort of a quagmire.  It's something where if you touch it, you can't get out of it.  Right.  It's, it's very sticky situation.  It's, uh, but again, it was used as a derogatory term back in the day.  And everybody knows what tar baby is.  Yeah, but fair enough.  No, I'm not even in back in the day. 
[01:11:30]  People still use that.  Yeah, of course.  The great joke.  Yeah.  You know, the jokes have had tar baby in it.  It's like, everybody knows that that's a racist slam.  Um, but, um, you know, uh, again, you have to, you have to say people that are upset with  somebody will just go to the umpteenth level with it.  I mean, with, with Bush, it was, how many signs did you see of Bush with the Hitler mustache  on and, you know, Hitler, baby killer, all that shit.  Um, you know, when you're going for the throat, you're going to use the worst thing possible. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Um, and, and you really got to watch, at least the worst president ever.  It's, uh, it's Hitler, uh, George W. Bush as Hitler.  Yeah.  And it's funny, Sharpton, I guarantee he criticized Bush, which is fine, but he probably, if somebody  insulted Bush, wouldn't have jumped in and said, you mean you're a president Bush?  Never, never.  Wouldn't be, wouldn't that be worse? 
[01:12:30]  Hitler?  Yeah.  Being compared to Hitler.  I, I think so.  Maybe some racist slur.  And not even a real racist slur, one that's like, you know, marginal at most, at best.  Basically, uh, saying that someone's Hitler, that seems, that's, that's a bad one, man.  Yeah.  I don't think Hitler had any redeeming qualities as, uh, after, um, you know, well, he, he painted  lovely, uh, great speaker, average painter.  And he, he invented some stuff.  Did he?  Well, uh, he, um, he, um, he pretty much is the father of, um, the, uh, highway system. 
[01:13:00]  It's just unbelievable.  Like, like the interstates.  It was pretty much just back roads and shit.  And then they looked at the German engineering of highways and, um, uh, banked turns and,  uh, a lot of lanes, exits, cloverleafs, things like that.  And he invented all that?  Well, his, his people that he put in.  He was good at delegating responsibility.  That's for sure.  Boy, was he.  Jesus.  And, uh, yeah. 
[01:13:30]  And, uh, our, our interstate system, uh, is pretty much based on that.  Hmm.  Well, we got a guy on the line, Ant.  He's very upset.  We lost a great, great actor over, overnight.  Uh, Bob in Jersey.  Bob, what do you got, sir?  Hey, uh, Sergeant Hightower, also known as Bubba Smith, died this morning at 66 years  old.  Natural causes, by the way.  Natural causes.  I am.  We lost Bubba Smith, Ant.  Lost Bubba.  What a great actor. 
[01:14:00]  A thespian, I dare say.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Hightower in the Police Academy movies is a thespian?  Yes, he was.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Good old Bubba Smith.  How was, uh, how was Bubba when he, when he played ball?  Oh, I don't know.  He was good, man.  I think he was a big, uh, he was an animal on the field.  He used to do those Miller Lite commercials, right?  Remember the funny ones?  I think that was Miller Lite with Rodney and all those guys.  I think Bubba was one of those guys.  Can we, uh, hear an old Bubba Smith, uh, commercial there, Sam? 
[01:14:30]  Please.  Big defensive end, I think, right?  This camping trip was a good idea.  Yeah, it sure is relaxing.  Peaceful.  Groovy.  How many people are dead in this?  It's very dark, though.  Man, I'm getting thirsty.  Yeah, let's have another light beer for Miller.  Lights, lights, Philly!  Lights, Philly!  Lights, Philly!  Lights, Philly!  Lights, Philly!  Lights, Philly!  What was that?  That creature.  What creature?  Well, legend has it. 
[01:15:00]  It's a horrible thing, Stalkytee Woods.  Oh, my God!  It comes out when the moon is full.  What does this creature look like?  The rocks are two legs, but it isn't human.  It's got big eyes and bulls, shouting.  Bob Buecher.  Rodney.  Rodney comes through the thing.  Hey, guys!  Hey, guys, where you going?  Hey, guys, we're on the mushrooms.  Light beer from Miller.  They were great commercials, man.  Yeah.  We need one pin, Rodney. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  Fuck, was that a good commercial?  One pin, Rodney.  Bowling.  Can you find that one?  One pin, Rodney?  If that's...  Rodney was great.  Oh, God.  They were funny commercials, man.  Less filling.  Tastes great.  These guys yelling at each other.  Everyone's dead in these commercials.  Yeah.  They're all, like, dead.  That's what happens.  Ugh.  What happened?  I was just watching these.  Eat anymore, but I still pump iron.  So after lifting a few hundred pounds, it's nice to lift one of these. 
[01:16:00]  There's some bodybuilders that we don't know.  Lot beer from Miller.  Lot taste great.  Lot taste great.  Ten and less filling with a third less calories than a regular beer.  They know bodybuilding is hard work.  But having a great body has its advantages.  Sure makes it easy to pick up, guys.  This is Rodney mugging.  Hi, Rodney.  Oh, hi there.  What's going on?  Hey, honey, how about I lift home, huh?  I like beer from Miller.  She lifted Rodney up.  I'm watching those.  Yeah.  Is this the bowling one?  I don't know. 
[01:16:30]  Bubba Smith just knocks all the pins down in all of the alleys.  Come on, three strikes and you're out.  We just went another round of light beer from Miller.  Yeah, light sure tastes great.  Let's build it.  Change great.  Go, go, go, go.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  There it is down there.  It's your time.  Eight balls in the pocket.  Bubba, this ball doesn't have any holes in it.  Bubba puts his fingers through.  I remember that.  The floor is all even. 
[01:17:00]  Flash frame.  Who's up?  Rodney.  Rodney.  You got to be able to say it.  Hey, you kid, this is a piece of cake.  All we need is one pin, Rodney.  Straight down the middle.  Makes a 90 degree turn.  No, it bounced off the fucking, didn't it bounce off the pin?  It bounced off the head pin and went into the gutter.  And none of the pins fell.  Oh, Rodney.  It bounced off the fucking head pin. 
[01:17:30]  Well, that guy, Bubba Smith, who's in a lot of those commercials as well.  Yes.  Fuck.  Died 66 years as well.  He's dead.  He's dead.  Speaking of movies, yes.  What do we got?  We have a black.  Oh, we do?  Yep.  Have you ever played the break or something?  Oh, I don't remember that.  I just want to say that this Planet of the Apes movie is getting fucking rave reviews, man.  You know, you could have picked a better segue.  Why?  Oh.  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  It is, though.  You're right.  Rave reviews.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  What is Rotten Tomatoes giving it?  Because maybe our paper's off.  Rotten bananas.  And does the movie open up on Friday?  Bananas.  Yes.  I believe it does.  88%.  88%.  How many reviews, though?  Two.  One.  One.  One review.  One and a half.  It would have to be two, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  88 and a half.  34 reviews.  Damn.  They said they got the monkeys right, man.  They just look fucking great. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they're CGI, which annoyed some people.  Right.  Why, they were mad they couldn't teach the monkeys to really act?  Yeah.  It takes a little much.  It's a bit much.  But I guess they're getting more of an emotional look on their face anyway, so.  Right.  Can't do that.  That's cool.  Yes.  Boy, when they're all just running rampant.  God, is that a nightmare?  Imagine that.  Yep.  Jesus.  Scary.  Yeah.  What? 
[01:19:00]  I want to see the movie.  Yeah, I know.  It looks very frightening.  Fucking in a store, and they're just fucking running out like that?  Oh, it's crazy.  Oh, here's the guy again, finally.  All right.  Chris in Rhode Island has something that's going on up there.  Chris, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Saw it in the news earlier this morning.  They got a guy out here in Cranston, and apparently he doesn't like his neighbor very much.  And found out his neighbor has cancer. 
[01:19:30]  So he put up a sign in his yard or his window, and it says, glad you have cancer.  Now die, stupid.  And they got people picketing back and forth in front of his house.  Is it on the news?  Cancer.  Yeah.  If you go to turntotend.com, that's turn, T-O, and the number 10.com.  They got a video of it.  You got turntotend.com?  Got another news site.  Yeah, you got it.  You got it?  Go to turntotend.com. 
[01:20:00]  Exactly.  Right.  Is there a video, though?  Yeah.  Angry residents protest neighbor.  He spelled cancer wrong.  Did he really?  How did he spell it?  Maybe he did that on purpose.  He spelled it with an S.  He spelled it with an S?  That's not on purpose.  Play the story.  Log on and become a fan of NBC10 on...  Who's a fan of NBC10?  You should be a fan of news ever.  Be a fan.  Well, the sign put up by the man who lives in this house telling his neighbor with cancer 
[01:20:30]  to die really sent neighbors over the edge, saying they've been putting up with bizarre  behavior for years, prompting the protest now, right?  Talk to the man who's the subject of their ire.  He says while he regrets that sign, he disputes their claims that he's an awful person.  Neighbors protest outside the Cranston home of Edward Jimmis, who posted a sign directed  at his neighbor reading,  Glad you have cancer, so die, stupid.  Bob Gold was the target of the message.  And I had to go over to the fence and look at it several times, walk away, come back. 
[01:21:00]  I said, oh my God, he's really done this.  He has so gone over the line.  Jimmis stayed inside his home during the protest, but spoke to me off camera after.  Commenting on the demonstration outside his door, Jimmis said, let them do whatever they  want to do.  As for the now infamous sign, he told me he put it up because Gold had been pushing  his buttons.  Jimmis tells me, quote, sorry for the sign.  It wasn't called for.  It wasn't me.  I wanted to hit a nerve.  It was directed at him, not everyone who has cancer. 
[01:21:30]  It was very distasteful.  I admit it.  I'm not a vicious person.  I did wrong.  I admit it.  But neighbors claim Jimmis engages in antagonistic behavior on a regular basis.  Lynn Soprano says he gives her the middle finger.  He is so bad.  He is so bad.  Jimmis claims he has arthritis, so the finger sticks up.  That old lady?  She looks like the fuck ass.  He has arthritis, so the finger just sticks up.  He allegedly shines a spotlight in one woman's window, and the neighbors can rattle off the  story.  This guy's an ass.  I've lost a lot of my eyesight. 
[01:22:00]  I can't drive a car or anything.  He'd come out here calling me.  You're blind.  Blah, blah, blah.  And stuff.  I just don't like that.  This guy's just a dick.  He's constantly antagonizing everybody.  When I asked Jimmis why so many neighbors have negative stories about him, he said,  quote, they all get together.  They show him in his doorway.  And his wife told me, quote, they're all troublemakers.  Jimmis told me how each neighbor started the problems with him.  Both sides of the feud say Jimmis does have friends in the neighborhood, but the message  was clear here.  Pack your bags.  Go find another town to live in.  Jimmis says he's willing to end the dispute, and when I asked him about leaving the neighborhood 
[01:22:30]  as people here want him to do, he says, I ain't going nowhere.  This is my house.  They can stay out there for three years.  It's not going to bother me.  I'm Brian Crandall.  It bothered you.  You wouldn't apologize, stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Nobody wants protesters in front of their house.  It's like Brewer with that neighbor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wonder what's going on with that.  All right.  Hey, Chris, thanks.  I'm not going to be a fan of this site, though.  They don't know how to do audio clips. 
[01:23:00]  No, it stinks.  It does stink.  Burn it off.  We got those guys coming in today.  Four of them, yes.  We got the Book of Mormon cast.  We have Rich and Otto, and then we have fucking four, Otto, four members of the Book of Mormon  cast, the leads.  That's very cool.  Josh again, Andrew, Nicky, who's fucking amazing, and the guy who we love, Rory O'Malley, I think  his name is.  With the pink luggage?  Yeah.  He's pink luggage?  I'm all better now.  I'm all better now.  Are you?  You fucking made me laugh, man.  Are you all better now? 
[01:23:30]  Are you?  Speaking of which, you're going to be in Utah there, Jimmy.  Yes, I am.  I just talked about the Book of Mormon in an interview in Utah.  I'm going there on the 19th and 20th of this month.  Nice.  Wow.  Yes.  Looking forward to that.  Yeah.  Um, when we get back, uh, in California, they're teaching, um, gay history in school.  Gay history?  In school.  What's that about?  I don't want, I don't want to send my kid to school.  No?  No.  And I don't want to homeschool him. 
[01:24:00]  What are you going to do?  I don't know, man.  Just give him a computer?  Just maybe wander around New York and show him life.  Learn what you want.  You could Google anything these days.  Why would you go to school?  Have you learned more with Google than you did at school?  Um.  Be honest.  I think I have.  Yeah.  Every day I'm Googling something and learning a little something about something.  Then again, I wouldn't be able to do Google if I hadn't gone to school because I couldn't  read.  All right.  You'd be like, what?  Honestly, of course, the basics.  Yeah.  Reading, writing. 
[01:24:30]  Rhythmatic.  Rhythmatic.  But even, uh, the stupid math crap.  After, after, um, I would say math is a complete waste of time.  Really?  After sixth grade.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Yeah.  So right there, why would I waste my kid's time with dumb math he's never going to use?  I, I, I, trigonometry and all that shit.  I did all that.  I've never had to use it.  What if he wants to be?  I'm not going to be a scientist.  What if he wants to be like a scientist? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Well, you, you, you're going to, you'll know what your kid is going to be at a very early  age.  So if he shows some, some, uh, some talent in that field, then okay, maybe, you know,  some aptitude.  Then you push him toward the math.  I'm not even fucking around.  This is real shit.  School's a waste of time for most kids.  That's a complete waste of time.  What math do you learn in seventh grade?  I was in sequential two math in seventh grade.  Sequential.  What the hell is that?  What?  In my school, they had sequential one, sequential two, and sequential three. 
[01:25:30]  What's that if you're thirsty?  No, I want a regular kid.  What does he learn in seventh grade math?  Do you remember anything you learned in school, Ant?  Ant remembers everything.  But that's why I'm asking him.  Except for the basic shit.  The basic shit is a given that, yes, kids should learn all that.  Yeah, I think, um, I think, like, uh, sentence structure, things like that. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  Grammar, things, nouns and verbs.  All that stuff.  Yes.  Nouns and adjectives.  Very important.  Multiplying and dividing integers.  Oh.  You're never going to use an integer in your life.  What is an integer?  Well, like, I...  We all did it.  I don't remember.  It comes when a juror's outside, and it's outer, and it starts raining.  Keep going, Chip.  Explain an integer.  You have to learn how to divide and multiply and do things with negative numbers. 
[01:26:30]  You would never use that.  You never had minus five oranges?  Right, thank you.  So why the fuck are they teaching this shit?  And then have to divide those non-oranges?  Yes, by six potential apples, and X is a banana.  How about you teach kids in high school how to fucking buy a house?  I'll take dividing.  Because when I finally had to buy a house, I didn't know what the fuck I was doing, because  no one taught me this shit.  See, what's 67 minus 81?  It's minus 14. 
[01:27:00]  But anyone should know that.  Because that's not seventh grade math.  You learned that before seventh grade.  Correct.  Why don't you go below zero for what?  For what?  Unless you get a bunch of degrees.  There's nothing there.  It was 67 degrees.  It dropped to 81.  No, it's minus 14.  Although that's called debt.  All right.  Let me say hi to Jim in Michigan.  Hey, buddy.  Jim?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  I was just going to tell Hopi, one of the things you can learn in school is the difference  between profound and profane.  Oh, that had a hurt. 
[01:27:30]  That really does hurt.  That will sting.  Touché, my friend.  Touché.  Hey, love you guys.  All right.  As you should.  That does hurt.  So maybe I shouldn't be talking about school ever.  You see, you don't even know what you learned.  I don't know.  Just the sentence structure, basic math.  But all that other stuff, like if you want to learn about gay history, you could Google  that.  Yeah.  Any of that social crap that they're teaching now.  Fuck that noise. 
[01:28:00]  My biggest one was Russian history in high school.  I'm like, we don't even have Russia anymore.  So why the fuck do we have to learn that shit?  I did learn some history that I enjoyed.  Which one?  I liked American history.  Yeah, that was fun.  You know, the Louisiana Purchase.  But they're saying, that's all bullshit now, too.  Oh, well, it's revisionist history now.  Because it's the white man's version.  Yeah, you got to make sure that black people are involved in every aspect of history making  in the United States.  Or you're racist and you're a liar and things like that.  Seventh grade is also when you start learning about algebraic expressions. 
[01:28:30]  I hated algebra.  All right.  Like angry?  Algebraic expression is this.  What the fuck is that X for?  That's an algebraic expression.  What are we looking at here?  Well, how would you express the sum of a number and five?  Is it N minus five?  Five N?  N plus five?  Five N equals get into another car on the train.  Or N over five.  My answer would be, who gives a shit?  When am I ever going to use this in real life? 
[01:29:00]  I wish I could have told my teachers this.  Explain to me how I'm going to use this, the sum of a number and five in my everyday life  after I get past this stupid school.  A lot of people do say that and they tell them, you don't know what you're going to be  doing and what you need this schooling for.  Because people will call you stupid if you don't know.  Well, they don't know either.  That's why they tell you that you don't know.  I will take, it's going to take a while, but fuck it.  I will take a thousand phone calls right now and I bet you we can't find one person 
[01:29:30]  that uses the sum of a number and five in their everyday life.  Who wants the bet?  Who wants the bet?  Some kind of actuary, I think, would do that.  Yeah.  What?  What does it even mean?  I know.  Why would a river and an ocean meeting do that?  I think I was being kind.  I bet you don't even need math after the fourth grade.  Really?  Fifth grade math?  Fifth grade probably is my application.  So you're saying fifth grade math is all you need.  My saffers. 
[01:30:00]  You're kind of laughing, but prove me wrong.  Prove me wrong, Ant.  Please do that.  Well, if you're going into accounting, it depends on what you want to do.  Yeah, but you can look at those weirdos.  If you want to be a pilot, you've got to know a lot of math.  And you've also got to be comfortable standing in the oven.  All right, Ant, how about this?  Very good.  How about this?  You want to be a pilot?  You start taking pilot fucking classes where they teach you all this shit. 
[01:30:30]  They teach you all that shit.  Why do you need to know what's going into it if they can reteach that shit?  And you're probably going to have to relearn this shit anyway if you go into any of those fields.  I think you need a basic understanding of it because they're not going to teach you the shit that you should have learned in high school and in college.  This is really advanced shit, and it's being applied to something.  It's not just learning it.  It's that that you've learned and an application of that into the job that you want to get.  So you're saying a basic understanding? 
[01:31:00]  Yes.  They can't just sit there and have a, you know, you want to be a pilot, and the guy starts teaching you sixth grade fucking math up to fucking, you know, how do you fly?  Just take pilot classes.  Is it to give you a little hat with wings on it and make the fly sound?  Well, Ant's right, though.  What's so funny about having a basic understanding?  We already said we hate Elvis guy style of you, asshole.  So you're pro school.  Oh, wait, no, I didn't finish. 
[01:31:30]  I'm pro school if you have a definite goal that you want to attain, and you're able to educate yourself to get yourself to that goal.  Remember how many hours was wasted on doing fucking...  Oh, I was wasted for hours.  Oh, you mean...  Doing homework in your room, and it was all nonsense shit.  I never did homework.  Smelling your own bed farts.  Smelling your own bed farts.  You were that smart, you didn't have to do the homework.  No, that's why, that's another reason I really had a hard time in school with my teachers and getting poor grades. 
[01:32:00]  Well...  Because I never did homework.  I hated the idea that I was home, and I would then have to fucking still do school shit.  Now you, now it's my turn, because we're debating this.  So now you're saying if you want to be a pilot and all that, right?  Yeah.  So why is it that less than 1% of all the kids in high school, let's say, just throwing a number out there, but you know the percentage is very low, or even want to go into that field.  So why do the masses have to go through this just so maybe they might want to be a pilot and need this basic knowledge? 
[01:32:30]  Why?  Because the rest of us don't need the number five end thing that Sam was talking about.  But I think it opens up people to a whole new, like, thinking.  Used to.  And you would be like, okay, I know this, I'm starting to learn it, I like this, you know, this type of math excites me.  And unless it's presented to you, you wouldn't know that you kind of like it.  Maybe it also helps you solve problems when your mind works that way, too. 
[01:33:00]  But I would say used to, because now I'm going back to Google.  Now that we live in this computer age, where else were we getting our knowledge and our info, but we had to get it at school.  And they were teaching the wrong shit in school when I was growing up, absolutely.  But now we're in this computer world, so why are we going to school and wasting time with this crap?  Is that a good thing?  How about a class where they say, okay, you come in with some knowledge that you care about.  But it's exercising your mind, too.  But you force them to exercise their mind through a Google or something. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, but you can't, because, let me tell you something.  That, our phones, everything else.  What was the last phone number you memorized?  You know, we're getting to the point with this shit where you really don't have to think.  I remember torturing myself, thinking for hours on end, who was that actor that was in a certain movie?  And you'd have to just sit there and think until you fucking remembered it.  And that, I think, kind of exercised your mind a little bit.  Now you just, you try to think of it for three seconds, you're like, fuck this, I am DB. 
[01:34:00]  Okay, it was that.  No, I think that this is better, because back then you wasted three hours and you came up with Elliot Gould.  Fucking, it is a waste of time.  That's not an exercise in your mind, trying to fucking remember who starred in a fucking bad movie?  I don't know, I think it, you know, you get some of those synapsa snapping in your head.  Yeah, I think it helps out.  Let me go to Mikey, you're all dummies.  Mikey.  Hey, boy.  Mike, I didn't know it was going to be a hit.  My 16-year-old kid got kicked out of driver's ed because he was failing Spanish. 
[01:34:30]  Whoa.  What?  Why are they connected?  How does that work?  I have no idea.  Driver's ed?  So you make the kid suffer because he's bad at Spanish?  That driving for retards?  Now you've got a shitty driver that doesn't speak Spanish?  Wait, where did your boy go to school?  Let's be Spain.  Or Mexico.  Yeah.  We're talking to you, Mike.  Yes, sir.  Please, Mike, you. 
[01:35:00]  In the upper peninsula of Michigan, Spanish hasn't spoken much around here.  Yeah.  You're looking at a guy that took six years of Spanish and I passed in the end and I couldn't  fucking do a sentence.  Yeah.  Adios mio.  What?  Yeah, but you had like Spanish help growing up, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's different.  You got to learn the dirty Spanish, the real Spanish.  Seventh grade is also when you start measuring and classifying angles.  Why?  Do you know what congruent angles are? 
[01:35:30]  The angle shit used to drive me nuts.  I had trouble with the angles myself.  Congruent?  Yes, I do know what that is.  And in the end, it was a waste of time for me.  I didn't need that stress as a 12, 13-year-old because I don't use angles in my life.  What are congruent angles, Jim?  The right angles that meet in your mother's cunt.  No.  No, I don't know what congruent angles are.  Elementary school.  Everyone's saying elementary school.  It becomes kind of a waste of time.  Oh, that's elementary.  Yes, it is. 
[01:36:00]  Wasn't algebra the name of one of the little rascals?  Bill the Trucker wants to know.  Are congruent angles the opposite of acute?  No, those are ugly.  Those are ugly.  Obtuse.  That's what Eric would be if he was a geometric figure.  Obtuse.  Obtuse.  Because it sounds like obese.  You're being obtuse.  Sorry, Eric.  What?  In the hole?  Obtuse.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Oh, sixth grade math.  Like, this is where it starts to get unnecessary, you said.  It's like learning about volume, mass, length, area, surface area, geometric figures. 
[01:36:30]  You rock.  Geometry is a lot of six.  Excuse me.  Oh, geometry.  So you're learning shapes and measurements.  Line segments.  Line segments.  You don't know what a circle is.  Well, it's more than that.  Yeah.  What is it?  There's a way to measure a circle.  Parallel lines never meet.  Why would you ever have to measure a circle? 
[01:37:00]  What?  How else are you supposed to do a good satanic ritual?  Get pentagrams all uneven?  You're in a fucking box?  The devil won't show up?  Your devil worshiper friends are laughing at you?  Yeah, the devil sends you a fax.  Make a circle, dickhead.  I'm not allowed out of hell.  Excuse my language.  Do you guys know how to find the area of a square?  No.  You just find out where you're standing.  That's easy.  You times the two.  What do you times?  You multiply the length and the width. 
[01:37:30]  Exactly.  Length times width equals area.  How about a cube?  How about the volume of a cube?  Length times width squared minus 40.  That's right.  Divided by the square root of pi.  That's length times width times...  Depth.  Oh, that's very good.  Is that right?  Yes, it is.  I think it is.  That's incredible.  But you're on the radio.  See, you've never had to use that.  No, but I've used it many times.  Length, width, depth.  Yes.  When I meet a girl, I do a...  I call it the pussy test, where I take putty and I fill her vagina and I see how much... 
[01:38:00]  Of your penis you're going to be able to push in there.  Yeah, or how much extra space I'm going to have.  And how much air will be released if you're doing it right.  Pie times the radius squared...  Equals delicious.  ...is the area of a circle.  How far can you go with pie?  I liked it, Jimmy.  What?  How far can you guys go with pie?  It's never ending.  E-Rock?  The whole thing.  Oh, come on.  The poor kid's just in there looking like two people.  Pie never ends, Sam.  But how far can you go? 
[01:38:30]  How far can you go?  I could eat a whole pie.  3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.  I can go 3.14...  3, 3, 3, 3.  ...and I know it's 22, 7.  3.1427.  No.  8, 5, 9.  9, 2, 3, 6, 4.  You guys are wrong.  I know how far I can get.  3.14 is correct.  Yes.  I can go as far...  I can go until I get a vagina in my face, and then I forget that stupid number.  You know what?  I could Google, and I could give you the answer.  3.14159265.  You Googled. 
[01:39:00]  That's how you're looking down.  Proving my point.  That's Jenny's number from that song.  God, am I bombing today?  I like the pie one, though.  I'm just tired.  Hey, let's say hi to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony!  Hey, uh...  I think one of the problems I had with history was that you never got to the end because history  keeps, you know, moving on and moving forward.  So, you spent three weeks on the Articles of Confederation, which spoke shit in the end,  and you never get to World War I or World War II when, you know, maybe you're interested  in what Hitler did or whatever it was. 
[01:39:30]  You're kind of right.  They never really focused on the 1800s and the early 1900s when we were growing up.  They really didn't.  They loved the Revolutionary War.  My God.  Yeah, they really did.  They loved the 1700s.  Yeah.  And then instead of teaching us the 1800s, they decided that we need to learn about, in  my case, Russian history, European history.  Who wanted to get depressed after that whole, you know, 1865 thing?  Jesus.  I'm not missing the point about school. 
[01:40:00]  I feel bad that my kids are going to have to deal with this shit because the school system  can't figure it out and reinvent itself.  Teach the boy chess at a young age.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  It's a very good mind exercise.  I don't think any kid should suffer through fucking homework.  What?  How do you have to?  But they make it a chore.  There's got to be a way to do it where it's fun for everybody.  They have to teach you unpleasant lessons because when you're, let's say you become  a lawyer, you have to do, there are certain lessons you learn which are bigger lessons.  Like, yeah, homework stinks, but the guys that don't do homework are never going to be 
[01:40:30]  willing to do paralegal work for fucking no money for 16 hours a day to become a lawyer.  It's like prep work for really necessary.  Yeah, that's what I think it is.  Why does it have to be so stressful and such a, you know, a bummer?  It does prepare you for that.  I agree you got to do homework and things like that and try to learn something, but I just  feel like they taught us a lot of shit that just doesn't mean anything.  I think school, the work itself, what you're getting is secondary to the experience of  the whole thing.  The taking responsibility, the social interaction, shit like that, I think it's more important 
[01:41:00]  with school than is the actual work itself.  Because homeschooled kids, they end up very smart.  They know a lot of things.  But I think a lot of them I've seen, they're a little socially awkward.  Yeah, that's, I agree with you.  Yeah.  I agree with you.  I just like that.  And that's all I did in school, by the way, was social interaction.  And the work.  It paid off well on the highway, didn't it?  The work, really.  Yeah.  You motherfucker.  All you do is scream at people, and yet you hoard guns. 
[01:41:30]  Boy, it's great lessons you learned in school.  You're just a mean motherfucker.  I really am.  All right, listen, we got Otto standing by, so we should take a break.  Yes, and Voss will be here soon.  And Voss should be here, I guess.  Oh, great.  And we got Book of Mormon guys coming in.  Three guys and a gal.  Which gal's coming in?  Nicky James.  The one that won the Tony?  Yeah.  She's amazing.  No.  Yeah.  Can she sing some shit for us? 
[01:42:00]  I don't know what they do in the morning, because of...  That's got to be rough, man.  They have, what's today, Thursday?  They have one show.  She probably has to rest her voice.  Wednesday, they have matinees.  This broad could sing.  It's tremendous.  Holy crap.  I didn't know she was coming in, too.  She won the Tony.  Yeah.  She's good to look at, too, man.  Yeah, she's very sexy.  I want to see her close up, because she's obviously great.  She's probably banging some handsome dancer.  Anne's not going to think she's sexy.  Banging a dancer?  Yeah, you're right.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Anne's not going to like her. 
[01:42:30]  He might.  I know who she is.  You're not going to like her.  I know who she is.  Just be nice.  I am always nice.  I'm very cordial.  You've got to go see this thing.  You really got to.  I'm telling you.  I asked Roland already.  Oh, you did?  I just got to get a date.  I'll go with you.  Look, she's meeting the fucking president.  What?  What happened?  Jennifer Hudson, just like fucking meeting the president.  Why?  She was just some fucking, because she's singing at one of the, at his birthday or something.  And she was just. 
[01:43:00]  Who's that guy?  That's Tracy Morgan?  She's just some American Idol fucking.  Oh, no.  That's Herbie Hancock.  It's Herbie Hancock.  That video with the kicking feet mannequin thing.  Oh, I thought that was Heather Mills.  You know how I had a crush on Jennifer Hudson until I saw her pancake tits?  Yeah.  So I'm not really into the Jennifer Hudson anymore.  She wore the wrong dress for me, man.  I'm out.  I'm out.  At least you stuck with it.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And last night, my son, no joke, we had to rewind a Jennifer Hudson commercial 30 fucking 
[01:43:30]  times because he was obsessing about it.  What do you mean?  We don't know.  He likes this commercial.  Oh, shit.  The one where she sings about the Weight Watchers shit?  Yeah.  And then the commercial's done, and then he's pointing to the remote, and he wants us to  play it again and again.  So we're sitting there going, why the fuck is he finding this fascinating?  Oh, boy.  I know that's an open question, but that's okay.  Turn this off.  You just read it and totally, that'll come out in therapy, and I didn't want to see  the commercial anymore, and he just wouldn't stop showing it to me. 
[01:44:00]  30 times.  But why?  Why that?  Every once in a while, this kid will pick up on something and get into it.  It's a weird jingle.  It's a sound.  It's not even the full version of the song.  It's the one where she only sings it a little bit, just like the first.  Oh, boy.  You are going to have your hands full there.  Hey.  Hope he's not a chubby chaser.  Here comes Shaniqua to Thanksgiving dinner.  Yeah, but I like the blacks, so.  Oh, that's good.  Maybe he's got a little jungle fever in himself. 
[01:44:30]  I hear you.  I got to pee.  All right.  We got this going into break.  I got it over here.  And then on.  And now, here's 39 seconds of actor and Academy Award nominee Don Cheadle on the Opie and Anthony  show.  It all.  It's not perfect.  What's up?  Hey.  It's a good actor, that guy.  Nothing.  Good actor.  He is.  You talked to him?  He's like, I'm going in here, man.  He's doing his way.  Yeah, he's booked up.  How are you doing, Don Cheadle?  I was on the plane with you yesterday. 
[01:45:00]  How are you doing, man?  Don, we just want to say hi.  That's all.  I know you're busy.  Big fan, man.  We can't take you away from another show.  That's not fair around here, but.  Yeah, look.  Look.  Get him here.  Get him here.  See, look.  All right.  Don Cheadle.  Don Cheadle, ladies and gentlemen.  We can officially say we had Don Cheadle on the show.  Add him to the list of celebrities that have done the Opie and Anthony show.  That was fucking awesome.  That was 39 seconds of actor Don Cheadle on the Opie and Anthony show.  Where's Otto? 
[01:45:30]  Otto's joining the show.  I guess Rich Voss was supposed to join the show, but Roland forgot to call you Rich, if  you're listening.  Or someone could get the word to Rich Voss.  Roland just ran down here and went, oh my God, I forgot to call Rich Voss.  I forgot to call Rich Voss.  So.  What?  I forgot to call Rich Voss.  Someone get the word out to Rich.  You know, there was no problem understanding.  You brought Big A with you?  Whoa.  Big A. 
[01:46:00]  What's up, Otto?  Otto.  What's up, Big A?  Opie, Anthony.  Hello.  Hello, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hello.  Otto.  Sit down, Otto.  Hi, fellas.  How are you doing?  How are you?  Fuckers.  We're trying to fucking mic Big A so we can hear him.  Oh, yeah.  Come on in.  Do you guys hang out now?  No, Otto.  You want a Big A?  So what's going on?  Otto must have needed a ride.  Hanging out?  Did you need a ride?  No, no, no.  Trish is in Greenland.  Oh, okay.  Tell her I said hi.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  I haven't seen her.  A couple years.  Good man. 
[01:46:30]  We're doing good, Otto.  Cold?  We're hanging.  That's good.  Yeah.  I worked up in Cape Cod recently.  I mean, Martha's Vineyard recently with Lenny Clark.  Oh, the vineyard.  Nice.  I was in a private plane.  Wow.  How was that?  I could get used to that.  It was very nice.  Get used to that.  Everybody was rich that I met there.  It was fucking...  Oh, that Yacht Club gig, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  It was with Lenny Clark.  And the guy that flew me in his private plane knew John Kennedy Jr., and I was grilling  him on why he got killed. 
[01:47:00]  He said that he was fighting with his wife and girlfriend right before they got on the  plane, and he probably just said, fuck it, and crashed into the water.  You know, I'll show you.  But seriously, he said that it was just a matter of making a call and saying, I'm lost.  I can't find the coast or whatever.  Yeah, the horizon.  The horizon.  Yeah, yeah.  You know how guys don't stop for directions?  He just, you know, he didn't make the call.  He didn't want to look stupid in front of the girls, you know?  What an idiot.  It would have just been, push a button and say, I'm fucking lost. 
[01:47:30]  Guide me in, you know?  Yeah, help me out here.  Help me out here, Hendry.  Crash my fucking plane here.  I'm trying to bang at you, brood.  I'm trying to bang this, brood.  And his foot was fucked up.  He had a foot in a cast or something.  Yeah, a broken foot, fighting with his girlfriend, and lost at night.  And the haze, yeah, there was a haze, and it was dusk.  He couldn't see the horizon.  And he lost track of which way his plane was actually flying.  Yeah, they said you could actually be going upside down and not even be aware of it.  Yeah, yeah.  You get spatial disorientation if you can't look at it.  And that's when you're supposed to trust your instruments. 
[01:48:00]  You're supposed to look and go, okay, if the artificial horizon says that I'm flying straight and level, I'm flying straight and level.  And sometimes it's the opposite where your instruments show you're flying straight and level, but it feels like you're turning.  It's insane, right?  But you've got to trust the fucking instrument.  Well, he wasn't instrument qualified.  No, but even not instrument qualified, you could look at your instruments and know if you're flying straight and level.  They might have pushed him through because he was a Kennedy. 
[01:48:30]  Of course.  The way Elvis didn't really earn his black belt.  Or his sheriff's badge, his DEA badge.  I'm a DEA agent, I'm going to make a big bust.  We're going to make a big bust today.  A big bust.  We're going to be singing.  He got a lot of perks, didn't he?  Oh, man.  Perks.  It's bad.  And he actually used to, didn't I hear stories where he used to pull people over?  Yeah.  And show his badge and be like, oh, culture speeding over there, won't you slow it down a little bit?  And people are like, fucking Elvis, just pull me over. 
[01:49:00]  He only liked prescription drugs.  He didn't dig pot or anything like that.  That's why Nixon thought he'd get in with the kids better by appointing him a DEA agent.  And it's ridiculous.  And doing laughing.  And then fucking murdering millions of people in Vietnam.  Soccer to me.  Soccer to the Cambodians.  Soccer to the Jews.  Fucking Nixon was a hilarious guy.  I went to the Statue of Liberty. 
[01:49:30]  Nixon was there.  He was the president.  I was about 12 or something.  And I had a Danny O'Day dummy.  And I wanted to get on camera the way people at ball games get on camera by making a sign.  I'll hold my dummy up and I'll be on TV.  And I was wrestled.  They wrestled the dummy out of my hand.  Some Secret Service guy.  I was choked.  And they yanked the knucklehead of Jerry Boney out of my head.  How many audiences have wanted to do that since? 
[01:50:00]  Just throw it in the garbage in front of you.  They tried to make me look like a dummy to that kid.  Go get him.  Wow, that's a great story.  They moved quick, boy.  He's like Kissinger, the Jew.  Nixon hated the Jews.  To make sure you weren't a threat, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Russell and Otto and his puppet to the ground.  Yeah, yeah.  They just wanted to make sure it's something odd sticking up out of the crowd.  I knew that had a scope and everything else, right?  It's like Liddy and Ehrlichman.  Yeah.  Big A! 
[01:50:30]  Big A, Jimmy.  Big A.  What are you doing there, Big A?  Yes.  You here to have your ankles measured?  Jesus.  No.  You do have some big ankles.  Your socks look like those things that you put on the end of a portable air conditioner.  Wait, wait.  What?  I'm trying to...  You know those giant tubes that come off the air conditioner that blow into your window?  Okay.  Like fucking robot from Lost in Space arms.  He looks good, don't he, Jake?  Yeah.  New suit. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  How much have you lost, Big A?  A little over 100.  Over 100.  Damn.  All right.  That's great, man.  Wow, damn.  And what's your goal?  To not die.  Yeah, of course.  I don't know yet.  You're almost there, I would say, right?  You're on a good fighting weight.  He's got to lose some more, but he's doing good.  You're doing great, man. 
[01:51:30]  At least you're in the right track, you know?  Yeah.  The color came back to your face, which is good.  Yeah, it's quite well.  You were looking scary there for a while.  His heart's not wrapped in bacon.  We were all whispering behind his back.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hope he doesn't die while I'm on vacation.  Yeah.  You're rosy cheeks.  No, you look great, though.  Seriously, Big A.  Okay, thank God.  It brings out the exorcist vomit color of your shirt.  We've got to work on your shirt colors next.  Wow.  Now that you've lost the weight.  Did you get that from Kenny's closet?  Yeah.  I think fucking Gary Busey flipped his motorcycle in that shirt. 
[01:52:00]  Terrible.  How's Lenny Clark, Autumn?  Very nice guy.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Very positive, you know?  Love.  I never really cared for the Boston guys too much.  I don't know.  They always had this...  Like, I used to work up there, but I did kind of the B circuit for this guy, Mark Rossi.  And then a couple of times that I met the A-list guys there, they kind of, like, shunned...  They all shut up and stopped talking when we came in the room. 
[01:52:30]  It was very clicky up there, the Boston guys.  Yeah, it was a big fucking click.  I didn't care for that.  Definitely a fraternity.  Yeah, but I've become friends with Nick DiPaolo since then.  Sure.  I mean, you know, I mean, Jay Leno's from Boston.  He's a great comic, but a lot of those guys suck, you know?  I think, you know?  I mean, Stephen Wright's probably the genius of all time up there, you know?  We had Stephen Wright on for the first time, finally.  Yeah, he's funny, right?  He loved it.  He was great.  Yeah, we had a great time.  You know, I couldn't stand fucking Jimmy Tingle. 
[01:53:00]  That political guy?  Yeah.  Stop it.  I know the name.  I don't know.  He's a liberal fucking cunt rag.  Yeah.  And he's up there.  And I had to go because Judy said he was so glorious.  You gotta go, my ex-mother-in-law.  Oh, really?  You gotta go see Jimmy Tingle.  We'll all go together.  First, we'll get some lobster and some drinks, some cocktails, and go see Jimmy Tingle.  And I'm just sitting in the audience like, there are some comedians, believe me, that  could spew out the most liberal shit, and I'm laughing my balls up. 
[01:53:30]  If it's funny, it's funny.  I hate that liberal, built-in audience.  All you gotta do is take a shot at Bush and get his applause break.  Oh, and then it's Greg.  Woo!  Because he needs to be clever.  Woo!  Or Sarah Palin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Do they really think they have any impact on anything, these political humorists?  None.  I hate a humorist.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he is, too.  He's a humorist.  He's not a comedian.  He's a humorist.  Humorous is a guy who wants to be a comedian but can't get belly laughs.  He gets polite chuckles.  Yeah.  So he's considered a humorist. 
[01:54:00]  You mean like the Borger?  Jimmy Tingle, Boston comic and social commentator.  Oh, that guy, the piano guy.  Yeah.  All comics are social commentators.  Let's listen to some Jimmy Tingle.  A little Jimmy Tingle.  Are we going to just try this one right here?  I hate it.  Yeah.  All right.  We just picked a random one.  He's behind it.  Oh, that guy.  The bottled water.  I'm going to have a drink of bottled water.  I drink it all the time.  Poland Springs from deep in the woods of Maine.  First time I saw that, I'm going, yeah, right.  Picture some kid, Eddie Poland.  Oh, I got more. 
[01:54:30]  From Portland, Maine.  Down this cellar with the garden halls.  The garden halls.  Filming things.  Yeah, we'll bring these down to Britain Circus.  They love this stuff.  When I was at 60 Minutes, I pointed this out to my boss.  I said, Jeff, look at the Poland Springs from deep in the woods of Maine.  He goes, bring a camera crew up to Maine.  Go see if there really is a Poland Springs deep in the woods.  And there is a Poland Springs.  And it is deep in the woods.  Well, it's near a gas station. 
[01:55:00]  But it's in Maine.  Social commentary.  Social commentary.  I hope you're not laughing over there.  A lot of them have ingredients shot from the water.  But he's not.  You know, he's fine.  But when he starts getting into his social commentary.  He's just talking about fucking water here.  No sugar.  No carbohydrates.  You're kidding.  Are you wrong with the fuck?  How long is this at?  I know.  You tell me that you have discovered water.  Enough about the water.  Oh, sugar? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fat.  Or carbohydrates.  All right.  That's worth three bucks.  Because if it had sugar, fat, and carbohydrates.  Enough about the water.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you think?  That'll only cost two bucks.  Unless you were at my theater.  Four bucks.  Because I got to make a buck, too.  I got a little more water.  Oh, but the bottled water is every place you go there.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible. 
[01:56:00]  There's a picture of a polar bear on it.  Polar bear.  Okay.  Polar.  All natural spring water.  You figure a polar bear.  North Pole.  It's from Alaska.  Or it's from Canada.  You read it.  Polar beverages.  Bottled in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Now, we've all seen polar bears in Worcester.  They come down every summer from Lowell.  See them floating down the Merrimack.  Pass Lawrence.  Pass Haverhill. 
[01:56:30]  I'm going to watch Rupert Pupkin.  I'm going to stop my own bottled water.  Jimmy Tingle's Boston Harbor.  One percent lead.  Two percent Southeast Expressway.  And then you have a tea party or something.  Yeah, Chip.  The Chip is much better than...  That is the magic that is Jimmy Tingle.  I mean, the opening line with the hose in someone's basement.  Fine.  Then move on.  Tighten it up.  Move on, then. 
[01:57:00]  Throw some of that shit out.  Right.  The first line was all right.  They kept promising me Bill Murray up there in Martha's Minute.  Bill Murray's coming to the show, and I was really excited.  And then they said Larry David might come.  I was like fucking walking on air, you know.  But neither of them came.  But I was like all over town, and I was talking to people.  And this fucking fat fuck at a hot dog stand was like...  I go, I was just in such a good mood.  I go, I'm performing tonight with Lenny Clark.  And he was like...  I go, Bill Murray might come.  And he's like, he's a drunk. 
[01:57:30]  I went...  I go, well, look at you, you fat fuck selling hot dogs in an alleyway.  That's all he is?  Is he a drunk?  That's all Bill Murray is?  Yeah.  You know, how can you just blurt that out like that?  He said, yeah, I'm selling hot dogs.  But during the week, I produced the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, like jealous, fat fuck he was.  That's an Iraq joke.  Is he known as a drunk?  I never heard that before.  No, they say he goes to barbecues on Martha's Vineyard  and just shows up with like two bottles of wine  and just goes, I'm sorry I'm late.  And he just joins like barbecues. 
[01:58:00]  That's awesome.  Yeah, he's like America's guest.  You know, who's going to kick Bill Murray out if he shows up?  Yeah, that's true, yeah.  Isn't that great?  I do like the fact, though, that you were so eager.  You were running around telling people that you were doing a show with Lenny  and that Bill Murray might come.  Yeah, I've never liked that.  I know.  That is bad.  Yeah, he probably went to bed early, but it was still a good show.  Oh, I had dinner with Belichick.  Bill Belichick?  Belichick, the guy from the Patriots.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the owner of the Boston Celtics was there.  Shit.  How close were you, Tim, as he was eating? 
[01:58:30]  Belichick, I was right across the table from him.  Holy shit, how'd you get that done?  It was friends with Lenny Clark.  Lenny knows all these people and stuff.  Oh, Lenny knows all those guys.  I'm a huge Jets fan, but that's still cool to be eating dinner with Belichick.  How was the gig?  He doesn't remember that.  I think it was all right.  It was a very crowded, small nightclub.  It was packed.  How's the Italian food here?  Try the hot dogs.  Best in the alley.  Sorry, Mike.  We got a Jimmy Tingle fan on the phones here. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, boy.  And I got one more question about Marta's Vineyard.  I want to ask you after this call there, Otto.  Cliff in New Hampshire.  This is Marta's Vineyard.  Yeah.  You like the Jimmy Tingle, Cliff?  Yeah, he's all right if you're from here.  You know, he's local.  He's got the local jokes.  Say local again.  It's like every New York City comic's got a bitch about traffic and tourists and prices.  No, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll take this.  We're not.  It's okay.  He went local and he's got local humor.  That's fine.  But, I mean, he went on and on about the stupid water. 
[01:59:30]  There's a million comics doing local humor.  And he's a racist.  And honestly, Steve Sweeney is from Boston, does the local shit, and it's beyond hilarious.  You will fucking hurt your ribs laughing at that guy.  But Jimmy Tingle should know he's been doing this forever.  That maybe cut down the water shit a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, the water's a little wrong.  You're right.  Well, in all fairness, we did pick the clip.  I'm sure there's better clips of him.  It's up on fucking YouTube.  Really?  So he picked it.  Did he put it up there?  Now listen to Steve Sweeney just for a reference point. 
[02:00:00]  I've never seen him perform.  Steve Sweeney?  Wow.  I want that shit.  It makes me fucking up.  Where is he?  A library?  I want to explain something before you say another stupid fucking thing.  Since we're going to be at Derodica here tonight.  I got this cold, okay?  And I haven't had a drink in almost 18 years, but I've been taking the NyQuil.  You ever taken that?  The green champagne?  There is something in that shit, I'm telling you. 
[02:00:30]  You wake up in the same position you fell asleep in.  And I looked in the mirror.  I got all this green shit driving.  In the dreams, I'm dreaming.  I'm the last gumball in the bumblebee.  So, all right.  I didn't even know what was on.  I'm so stoned from that fucking nightclub.  I'm so good. 
[02:01:00]  Got some Robitussin.  But listen, just because I don't drink, I want, you know, this is great.  You guys, drink as much as you can.  Drink as fast as you can.  Get in those cars and gun it.  Got some nice slippery robes.  Have some fun.  Jesus Christ.  I think these Andylo cops work for their money.  Jesus Christ.  We've got a crowd coming out of the wine of Blossom.  Holy shit. 
[02:01:30]  Look at them.  All over the goddamn road.  Yeah, milk, two sugars, and one jelly.  There you go.  A little taste of Sweeney.  He is mud laughing, man.  I love Sweeney, man.  That nightclub shit's funny.  You wake up in the same position you're fucking in.  I love Sweeney.  Oh, you certainly do.  Did you see where Belushi was buried?  That's a good question.  No, it was on the other side of the island, and I was without it.  We parked our car in this airport in Boston and just flew there.  But we stayed in this beautiful bread and breakfast right by the water. 
[02:02:00]  A bed and breakfast.  It's awesome.  You don't stay in a bread and breakfast.  What, are you sleeping in rolls or something?  Yeah.  I remember.  Do you like that bread and breakfast thing?  No.  It was okay.  There was a TV this big, like 30 feet away from me.  See, somebody's house.  I like that shit.  Did Lenny stay in a hotel?  He's got a house there.  So he made you stay in a bed and breakfast while he had an extra room?  I wouldn't want to stay in his house.  You should have gave me an extra room.  I like staying in people's house.  You did stay in someone's house.  You're staying in someone's house.  I don't like staying in people's house. 
[02:02:30]  No, no.  I want a hotel.  I want a fine hotel.  Yeah, exactly.  You can get up in the middle of the night, scratch your balls, walk in, take a shit,  come back out.  It doesn't matter.  You don't have to work.  Like, I know their job is to take care of it like it's a hotel.  Yeah.  But you don't feel like you can just throw towels around and leave them there?  No, exactly.  Like, I don't care about the savages that got to clean the fucking rooms at the hotels.  You missed what Otto said, though.  What happened?  He goes, you like staying in people's houses.  And Jimmy goes, you were staying in someone's house.  Yeah.  A bed and breakfast or a bed and breakfast. 
[02:03:00]  A bed and breakfast is someone's house.  Well, I don't know.  And they're usually swingers.  Those are the only people that run a bed and...  Yes, they're looking for action.  No, this was a house where each room was a hotel room where the maid comes in and there's  a TV.  It's someone's house.  I don't like that shit.  Yeah.  Did you have the owner cooking you breakfast in the morning?  They loved doing that.  Yeah, there was some croissants out and shit.  But when we left at like five in the morning, we had to leave the next day.  Oh, I got a really weird call last night from...  I'm going to be on this thing with Rita Rudner, of all fucking people. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, man.  She's doing a Showtime special called Four Future Ex-Husbands.  And she wants me to be one of the stand-ups.  Oh, okay.  That's awesome.  That's a pretty unlikely call from Rita Rudner, you know?  Yeah.  I'll take it.  That's cool, yeah.  Showtime.  Yeah, they don't pay much.  I've been on Showtime before.  I'm getting the same money I got in 95 when I did Dom Irera, Full Frontal Comedy.  Yeah.  I remember that.  I remember you do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd rather just fucking hotel it. 
[02:04:00]  I leave the place a disaster.  Hotels are great.  And I never...  You're running like Dominique Strauss-Kahn.  Yes.  You're fucking crying African.  He's right for the airport.  Yeah.  Because if I'm going to stay in a hotel for up to like maybe three days, I don't call  for fucking...  Nothing.  ...for them to clean up.  I lock the door, but don't not disturb.  I'm the same.  I just need towels and a lot of coffees and stuff.  That's it.  A lot of creamers.  Oh, the room's a mess.  I can give a shit.  Yeah.  I'm not listening to my house. 
[02:04:30]  I'm going to be gone in another couple of days.  So fuck it.  Yeah.  Does it look like a serial killer's lair after three days?  Yeah.  It really does.  Pretty neat.  It looks pretty bad.  It does.  The first thing I do is take my tongue and I clean out those little buttons on the remote.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the cum buttons.  Because what's the first thing you do after you're fucking...  You got all cum and vag juice on you and everything?  I cover the girl's face with a sheet.  Do you have a thing about flip-flops and showers and condos you never took a shower without flip-flops, right? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Or shit.  Yeah.  I mean, I just like flip-flops.  That's not like germaphobe.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  That's not like, you know, obsessive, right?  Right.  No, no, no.  In a hotel, I'll wear bare feet, of course, but in comedy condos, they were gross.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  There's always that one jar of mayonnaise that somebody spewed in before they left town.  Oh, my God.  Immediately throw the mayo out the first.  Those condos were fucking disgusting.  And you were forced to stay in them, obviously.  As soon as I got a little bit of power of any kind, I immediately said, I'm never staying in a condo, and it's got to be a Holiday Inn or better. 
[02:05:30]  No fucking Super A.  Not that Holiday Inn's are great, but I thought it's good enough for me, you know?  It's usually got a pool.  It's a decent-sized room.  I like hotels where you have to be in a hallway inside to get to your door.  You like that?  I don't like those where you pull your car up.  Oh, yeah, right.  And then the door is right there out to the parking lot.  No, those are, yeah, that's more.  That's a motel.  That's like on the lam. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  When you're on the lam.  Very true.  Okay.  All right, then.  Yeah, yeah.  Mr. Smith.  Mr. Lundergaard.  Okay.  One minute, please.  Ah, yeah.  You're right there.  Go out the back of the window in those Lundergaard.  Shady's trying to get out the window.  Shady and crying.  Screaming and crying.  Okay.  And the funny thing is, they first knocked, and I guess he gave Mr. Smith as his alias.  So they go, Mr. Smith.  And you hear him go, who?  He doesn't even get that right.  You can't remember that he gave a fake name. 
[02:06:30]  It's Lundergaard.  The worst planned crime ever.  Oh, horrid.  Isn't that whole thing a true story?  No.  It says it was true at the beginning, but they just put that in as like a kind of a whole  goof.  A little bit of a thing.  Was the lead investigator a nine-month pregnant woman?  Yeah, I don't think so.  On a fucking quadruple homicide?  She was great in Mississippi Burning, too.  And Gene Hackman gave her a good fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Did he fuck her in that?  Yes, he did.  He just flirted with her.  Oh, no.  He fucked her.  He banged her? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Willem Dafoe says, you aren't partial to sleeping with witnesses.  And then fuck it.  That was not a good Willem Dafoe, but I don't know who it was.  Perfect Pete Allure.  What about when Gene Hackman grabs that hillbilly's testicles?  Yeah, that was fucking Michael Rooker.  Oh, yeah.  That was great.  Yeah.  And then he's holding on, and he gives him a twist.  Yeah.  And then he fucking...  Great.  I gotta see that one again.  He grabs him by the balls.  I love when he beats up Billy Bivett in the fucking...  When he beats him up in the...  In the barbershop?  Oh, it's great.  Yeah, he beats the fuck out of him. 
[02:07:30]  It's great.  I'll cut your fucking head clear off, and I'll give a shit how it reads in the report sheet.  Great movie.  Yeah.  A lot of laughs.  I like that in Fargo.  A lot of laughs.  They're in that fucking shitty place, watching Jose Feliciano.  Hey, Jose Feliciano, you know, you could do a lot worse.  He said, you got no complaints?  Yeah, he said, waiter on vacation?  He said, no complaints.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes, she enjoys him.  That's just later on.  Just the most impatient shithead.  Steve Buscemi's little fingers are not going to be heard across the road. 
[02:08:00]  I got shot in the fucking face.  You should see the other guy.  How do you split a claw with a chainsaw?  You fucking idiot.  Yeah, with the nice socks sticking out of the wood chipper.  Oh, and he's arguing with a psychopath over fucking 10 grand.  Yeah, what was wrong with that guy?  I want pancakes.  Jesus.  Pancake house.  Traveling companion.  We go to pancake house now.  Yeah.  Fucking movie's great.  One of my favorites.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  That's right up there.  One of my favorites, man.  Fuck yeah.  Hysterical.  I haven't seen that in a long...  It's time to see it again, Jimmy.  A long time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those accents.  It was like being in another planet.  I never heard those fucking accents.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love the old guy who was shoveling.  Oh, yeah.  He was good.  Oh, yeah.  And the story.  I said, well, what kind of place do you think this is?  Well, what kind of a fella do you think I am?  He says to him.  Imagine hanging out.  Imagine spending holidays with that guy. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, God.  Terrible fucking stories.  It looks like we got a front coming in.  Yeah.  It has to end with the weather.  They both look up all stiff because their jackets are so heavy and big.  Yeah.  He wants to live there.  That looked so incredibly cold.  Yeah.  Very bleak, right?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Even the Chinese guy had that accent.  It's a Radisson.  It's pretty good.  It's pretty good.  It's a Radisson.  Saul.  You married old Norm, son of a Gunderson.  Son of a Gunderson.  You're such a super lady. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Lots of yucks.  And then he's lying because he's fucking...  The chick they never married.  Yeah, yeah.  He stalked her.  Yeah.  She fought so hard, my G.  She sits next to him.  Yeah.  He sits next to her.  A creepy, unnecessary, like, plot twist that guy was.  That was the weirdest thing to just throw in there.  Had nothing to do with the momentum of the story.  It was good, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like how they just threw that in there.  Freaky Chinaman.  Nothing to do with the story.  Calling her in the middle of the night.  Saul, my G.  All right. 
[02:10:00]  Something.  Shut up.  Big A's been ready to say something.  Yeah.  Oh, Big A?  Yeah, I saw.  I saw you were ready to say something.  He's been gearing up since 8.15.  You've been gearing up since 8.15.  What were we going to say?  You like Fargo?  Big A.  Yeah.  Quickly.  You know any lines from the movie, like these guys?  You want them to do one line from Fargo?  Just one line with your inflatable ref shoes.  You got a line from Fargo for them, Sam?  We're not a bank, Jerry. 
[02:10:30]  Which one do you want them to do?  Do that one?  Andrew doesn't stutter when he sings, we found out.  When he sang Happy Birthday to Jimmy, he didn't stutter at all.  Yeah, in karaoke he doesn't stutter either.  Oh, well, sing something.  It's amazing.  Sing Happy Birthday to me again.  Quickly.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  It's awesome.  Go through your life singing.  Just sing to everyone.  Life is a musical for you.  You know what?  By the way, we have four amazing singers coming in.  Maybe we could arrange for, maybe you could do a little something with the Book of Mormon 
[02:11:00]  cast.  I like that idea.  It's the hottest show in the country.  One line from Fargo.  Or two.  As Bing Crosby as Gunderson.  I want to see old Bill Deal, Northwest Federal.  Bill Deal.  You know Bill Deal's just a fucking prick.  Working at that bank of Deal.  Dick in the mud, Bill Deal is an ass.  Bill Deal never gives a break.  Oh, you couldn't get a dollar from Bill Deal. 
[02:11:30]  The father-in-law was a scumbag.  Oh, what an ass he was.  What's his name, though?  Yeah, he was.  Jerry.  His awful 80 hairs daughter.  Yeah.  That fucking hairdo is terrible.  Just screaming in the carpet.  Watching the gophers?  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Prick.  Shitty TV in their hideout there.  Oh.  Come on, you motherfucker.  We should break, because we've got to give away these Eastbound and Down things. 
[02:12:00]  What?  Fuck.  We've got three of them today, because we forgot to give them away this week.  Here's one.  It's signed by Danny McBride.  Eastbound and Down DVD.  When Kenny Powers comes back, he comes back hard on the hilarious and profane HBO series,  Eastbound and Down, the complete second season of DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download today.  Experience Kenny Powers deep inside Mexico.  Must be at least 18 years older, and a listener or subscriber, not open to residents of Alaska,  Hawaii, or Canada.  We'll give one away to a random caller right now.  Signed by Danny McBride. 
[02:12:30]  Second season of Eastbound and Down.  All right?  Auto.  Let's plug Auto's game.  Yeah, where's Auto going to be?  This Saturday.  This is actually a phenomenal show.  7 p.m., Starland Ballroom.  It's in Saraville, in Jersey.  It's John Valby and Otto.  Oh, man.  That's great.  And Kenny Michaels and Chris Johnson.  Now you go, who's Kenny Michaels?  Who's Kenny Michaels?  You guys have such a narrow specter of comedy.  If it's not Voss or Patrice or me, you know, you never fucking have this.  Yeah, we have no clue.  There's some really good acts out there that just need to fucking break.  Exactly. 
[02:13:00]  And we've just named none of them.  I know.  We're a fucking mafia family.  We're not making it in new people.  We can't open the books just yet.  Sorry.  But even people that do wind up squeaking through it don't treat other members of the family right.  Really?  Yeah.  It's just the way it is.  That's why we have ice picks.  That should be a good show.  How many shows have you done with Valby so far?  But he never shut the fuck up.  A few.  A few.  They're going well?  He's like, he goes, I don't like to go fourth at a gangbang. 
[02:13:30]  I go, well, you know, there's three acts before you and you take it easy.  You don't have to do two hours.  You're playing the piano.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's...  Body, lie, low.  Body, lie, lie.  I do love John Valby.  We love Valby, but he's a little strange.  He's such a lone wolf guy, you know.  I was trying to sell a show in Vegas with the two of us just so we could come off the  road, but he wasn't buying it.  He's just...  What is he doing?  He's still driving around in that shitty van?  And he wouldn't do our traveling virus tour?  Because he didn't want to cancel a gig in Fredonia or something. 
[02:14:00]  That's insane.  What are you doing?  Fredonia.  I'm not even joking.  I know.  That's exactly it.  HBO approached, huh?  He told them to go fuck themselves years ago.  HBO?  I thought it was the song rights.  Did he really tell HBO to fuck off?  Well, it didn't happen.  They wanted him to do a bunch of specials.  Why didn't it happen?  He must have done something fucked up, you know.  I don't know.  Maybe he's just one of those guys.  I think he's really funny, man.  Yeah.  He's completely...  It's a no-brainer.  You and Valby.  It's a great show, man.  It's the greatest show ever. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be really fucking filth-ridden.  Yeah.  So either way.  It's going to be cool.  Chris Johnson.  Chris Johnston.  Did I say it right?  See, you don't even know who he is.  You don't even know who he is, and you want us to know who he is.  No, I do know Chris.  And then Kenny Michaels, awesome guy.  He does a great Paulie Walnuts.  He hates doing it, but I make him do it.  And he does Syl also from the Soprano.  I do both of those guys.  Yeah.  Hey, Skip.  That actually wasn't bad.  I'll do Paulie Walnuts.  Chip could do Paulie Walnuts. 
[02:15:00]  See, I could do Silverstein, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Tony.  Bring me the guns.  Something like that.  You know, I do all of them.  I do Paulie Walnuts.  It's good, though.  Hey, give me the silver paint for my hair, Skip.  He puts the fingers out.  I put my other two.  The pointer finger on the other one, like the scissors.  Oh, you didn't do the, uh...  I could do Tony's Soprano.  Oh, yeah?  Good.  Also, Big A's a big part of my pig roast, which is coming in September.  To an internet near you. 
[02:15:30]  Nice.  I did.  I was interviewed for that show.  I thought it went well.  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah, I did.  Well, that's it.  What am I going to say?  I didn't see the final cut.  You might have cut my jokes.  Oh.  I thought that was my best joke.  It's more than a talk show, though.  You only saw that component of it.  We're doing fucking animations.  You know, fucking...  Let me see that.  Sam, turn that.  I actually look pretty skinny there.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Or no, I don't.  I look pretty sickly, actually.  That is hilarious.  I look like Richard Mole if you had cancer.  You're meant to have your seat that much higher there, Otto? 
[02:16:00]  No, no.  They just gave me that chair.  All talk show guys are higher than the guests.  Oh, I know.  But that's hilarious because you're sitting in a chair.  You're much higher.  You have a TV tray that you would use to eat on in a living room if you're watching TV.  Well, we're obviously not going the Letterman route.  It's supposed to be my apartment.  I live there, and people come and go.  And I have this band called the Abe Ruiz and the Squatters that also live there.  And there's these great-looking girls called the Piglets who dance around like Vegas showgirls. 
[02:16:30]  That's hilarious.  I would watch this.  Yeah.  I would watch this.  Can you grab me a picture for me soon?  Yeah.  I want that picture.  It's Otto with Aces.  Hi.  I didn't know what Otto was talking about.  He was like, well, I would like him to come on and debate me, but he won't.  But he won't.  Now, the hell's he doing?  All right.  Very cool.  Otto and George on Twitter.  I hope you guys will come on once you see it up and running.  It's funny, man.  Yeah, yeah.  When you asked me to go, I had something going on. 
[02:17:00]  I just couldn't get out of it.  Yeah, you had the Museum of Modern Art, and he had to go home and buy hollow-point bullets  from a man.  I had to buy guns.  I did have a legitimate thing.  Gold dot.  No, I know.  Gold dot hollow-points.  No, I was grateful that you guys even considered doing it.  I'd be honored to do it.  No, no.  I absolutely will do this.  I would be honored.  I love that set.  It's fantastic.  We're going to continue with Otto.  Don't forget, Otto and George.  John Valby.  This Saturday, 7 p.m., Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey.  I'm going to be out of town, or I would go to this thing in a fucking second. 
[02:17:30]  Where's Sayreville?  Maybe I can get back.  It's probably Bon Jovi.  It's over by where Club Benet used to be, near the Outer Bridge.  It is Club Benet, isn't it?  Club Benet.  No, it's not the same room.  I know the George Washington Bridge, and I know the Lincoln Tunnel.  Where am I going?  It's, I would say, 25 minutes south of Newark Airport.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I might be able to fucking do this then.  Around where Staten Island meets Jersey, the Outer Bridge, in that area.  All right, right on.  Yeah.  I highly recommend you go see this show.  It's going to be a great one.  More with Otto and George. 
[02:18:00]  And Big A, you're going to be singing I've Got the World on a String by Michael Buble when we get back.  He sings.  Yeah.  He is in style when he sings.  It's amazing.  Acting lessons.  Singing lessons.  So try to find a version of I've Got the World on a String for Big A.  He does that next.  And then the Book of Mormon, guys.  Stay there.  Yes.  I know something about opening windows and doors. 
[02:18:30]  I know how to move quietly to creep across creaky wooden floors.  I know where to find you sleeping.  And I know that I can score. 
[02:19:00]  I'm clipping the clippers.  The clippers through the telephone wire.  Theolpian Anthony Show, on Sirius XM.  The Virus.

[02:21:30]  We were gonna have Big A sing Michael Buble  Then we had the Otto thing  Oh, I asked you about Belushi really quick  Just to get back to that  It wasn't just a throwaway  I went, there's a cemetery in Martha's Vineyard  And you pull up  And you get out of your car  And you almost step on his fuckin' gravesite  He's got shitty placement  In the cemetery, yes  That might be a decoy grave  I heard that  Oh, really?  That he's buried somewhere else  I heard rumor of that  Oh, cause I mean  I remember 
[02:22:00]  It's just a little fuckin' country road  You pull in  And then you get out  Like, where is he?  And then, boom  He's right there  Fuck  Like, really?  I don't know  I mean, going to a grave  With somebody I didn't personally know  Yeah, that's just weird  I'd rather just watch the Blues Brothers again or something, you know  Yeah  I like some of that morbid shit  You do?  Yeah, a little bit  Yeah  Yeah, a little bit  I went on a death tour in LA  I saw the motel where Janis Joplin died  Oh, yeah  The Chateau Marmont where Belushi died  What else did I see?  River Phoenix's dead spot  I like the one where fuckin' Fred Mertz keeled over on the corner 
[02:22:30]  That's a great one  Hey, Rick  Red Mertz  Wow, just fuckin' drops dead  They do it with a sense of humor  It used to be called Grey Line Tours  But the locals kicked them out  So now they're in buses  So you're not really sure which one  They used to go in a hearst  I went in a hearst  My friend Stephen Pearl, who's a comedian, did this for me  And then he was doing a bit  I thought he's not a necklace  He was  Fuck Jim  Jesus  Fuck Jim  He was doing this bit about the last words of dead celebrities 
[02:23:00]  And he had the dates  And the way they died so accurate  Like, one of them was  I'm tired of hanging out with you, you fuckin' loser  Take that enormous tripod and shove it up your ass  Bob Crane  And he would have the exact death date  And he's like a real anal about that  What a crane  What a crane  Tired of hanging out with you, you loser  Take that enormous tripod and shove it up your ass  And then he goes  Gee, those azalea trees are getting awful close 
[02:23:30]  Stevie Ray Vaughan  April  And he's like  Fucking funny  That's a great fucking bit  He had like 50 of them  He had us dying  Stephen Pearl  And you took the tour too  And what made it funny  They had a little  It was cassettes  Yeah  And they would start the music  It'd be all nice  Like they would have the I Love Lucy theme  And all of a sudden they would say  Oh yeah, he dropped dead right there  As he was leaving a premiere  Did Fred Mark drop dead on the sidewalk?  Right on Hollywood Boulevard  Oh wow  What year?  60s?  I don't know  William Frawley 
[02:24:00]  Because he was just a fucking fat drunk  Yeah  The best  I think it was the Roosevelt Hotel  You pull up and they start the  Somewhere  From the Wizard of Oz or whatever  And one of the witches  But her death  It was a good witch  Glenn DeGroge  Oh  Her death was horrific  She finally had it with Life in Hollywood  So she got her best dress on  She did all her own makeup  And then she proceeded to put a bag over her head  And tie it nice and tight  Are you serious?  And that's how she killed her  That's how Glenda the Good Witch died?  In a dread  Yeah  Can you imagine how morbid that would be 
[02:24:30]  That's a very grim death  To suffocate yourself  There's not a lot of air in this bag  Glenda  It used to be the greatest thing to do in LA  But the locals  They would give the hearse the finger  And they would try to run him off the road  He would tell me all the stories  So then they had to go underground  And get just a basic  Who gives a fuck tour bus  Oh okay  But this guy was hilarious  Did you guys hear a ring?  Yeah  Oh thank god  I thought that was in my head  Nobody acknowledged it  Whose phone?  Was it yours Adam? 
[02:25:00]  Oh  Who knows  I don't care  That's why we do that  We don't acknowledge it  What were some of the other ones?  I never do  They did the Bewitched  They would have the nice Bewitched themes  Oh with  For who?  For all of them probably  I think they're all dead now  The witch woman  What was in there?

Yeah  Do they tell the story of her death?  What is this bitch?  She died in Los Angeles of natural causes  Putting a bag over your head is not natural causes  Not breathing is though  Wow  85?  No  85  Of course this guy  Man remembers too man  You sure it wasn't another witch hope?  Maybe 
[02:26:00]  Maybe the bad witch?  She died in Westchester  No the bad witch was fucking  Westchester  Then this guy had it all wrong  No no  Someone help me out  I'm not letting this one go  Yeah yeah  They're all dead  There was an actress in the 30's called Loopy Valdez  Loopy Valdez took a bunch of sleeping pills  And like spread herself out in her favorite gown  Wanted to look beautiful  And she was found with her fucking head in the toilet  Because she was vomiting up these sleeping pills  So she was covered in puke with her head  In there  Disgusting  Your head was in the toilet 
[02:26:30]  Disgusting  That's quite the way she wanted to be  Oh that's classic  She must have felt pretty loopy  Oh shit  I'm just ripping with Otto  Is that a true story Otto?  That's a true one?  Yeah  That's hilarious  Getting info  Belushi buried in California  The grave in Martha's Vineyard  Is just a grave  It's just like a Martha  So he's not buried in Martha  According to this guy  I don't know  I heard it was a decoy  Yeah  I absolutely saw a Belushi gravestone  Sometimes they have memorial markers  Just so you can go there and go 
[02:27:00]  Yeah I remember that guy  He was a nice guy  Yeah  I remember that  Over here  Did they ever steal any famous corpses?  Like didn't Chaplin get stolen or something like that?  So one of those guys got stolen  Was it Charlie Chaplin?  Somebody like that  Stole his fucking corpse  Did someone have someone's skull  And they had it under their bed for  What Sam?  Sam knows?  No this was Auntie Em  That died in that way  Oh  Oh  Really?  She was such a nice lady 
[02:27:30]  Read about her death  Let's see  Her health started to fail throughout the 1950s  Yeah  Auntie Em  Right  So she was in her house in LA  She began rearranging her room  Placing her favorite photos and memorabilia  In prominent places  Yeah  She laid out her resume  And a collection of press clippings  From her lengthy career  She dressed immaculately  In an elegant royal blue dressing gown  Then with her hair properly styled  She took an overdose of sleeping pills  She laid down on the couch

Did they have a William Frawley?  So we could get it back to him  Exactly  See because  Some of these facts  We have a little 
[02:31:00]  He was old in the 40s  When he did  When he was doing I Love Lucy  And look up the Dragnet guy  Because they show you his garage  Because the garage is right off the road  Where he died  William Frawley  I'm not sure if he was killed in his  In his garage  Or maybe the car thing  He might have went with the car thing  On March 6th 1966  Frawley collapsed of a heart attack  While walking down Hollywood Boulevard  After seeing a movie  Inside Daisy Clover  God the movie was that bad  Wow  He was dragged to the nearby 
[02:31:30]  Knickerbocker Hotel  Where he had previously lived  For many years  But his male nurse  A constant companion  Since his prostate cancer operation  He was then rushed to the hospital  Where he's pronounced dead  Wow  Hey what's going on with that  His male nurse  Constant companion  Wow  We got a prostate surgery  Wow  Did he leave behind any kids?

Light comedy with singing, dancing, and patters 
[02:32:30]  And then collapsing of a heart attack  Yeah  He would pinch her nose and fart in her mouth  Oh that vaudeville  An old vaudevillian  Look at his belt up to his nipples  That was hilarious  He'd come in the fucking  Into Desi's  Lucy's apartment there  Ricky and Lucy  Yeah someone did jump off the Hollywood sign  I don't know who that was  Oh yeah?  Look up the drag neck guy 
[02:33:00]  I think his was a good death  Wasn't there a comedian  That splattered himself  Fuck yeah  In front of the  Steve something  Comedy store  Comedy store  During that strike  From the hotel  He jumped off the Hyatt  Yeah  He jumped off the fucking Hyatt  Have you ever seen  The two buildings  He splattered himself  He wanted to land  On the front door  Of the comedy store  Because he was that fucking pissed off  I heard he couldn't get on stage  And then  After the strike  Then during the strike  You know  They would take anybody  And then  The strike was resolved  Like the next day 
[02:33:30]  And he was like  Hated by all the comedians  So he just took his life  Wow  Terrible  Couldn't take it  Yeah  So that was  No not Harry  Harry Morgan  No  He's alive  That was Joe Friday  Harry Morgan  Jack Webb  Jack Webb  Jack Webb  Jack Webb  Jack Webb  How did he die?  I know  They found him in a garage  He died of a heart attack  In 1982 
[02:34:00]  At the age of 62  He's giving a funeral  That's young  Those guys smoked  Five packs of cigarettes  A day  Cigarettes  They would smoke  They would eat those things  Yeah  They'd do the commercials  For him too  Yeah  Yeah sure  I smoked Philip Morris cigarettes  Yeah  And there's just  Nine out of ten doctors surveyed  Right  Say it's got a smooth draw  Yeah doesn't  Smooth around a trot  As the fucking doctor's  Hacking your chest open  Yeah  Damn  They didn't mention the garage 
[02:34:30]  Alright  What happened in the garage  I guess that's where he had the heart attack  Yeah the days of a hearty handshake  In a non-filtered Chesterfield  Yes  You die at 55  You fucking asshole doctor  Yeah  This says that around 3am  On December 23rd  Jack awoke  Complaining of stomach pains  The Surgeon General warning  Didn't even come out  Like  Till like  Sometime in the 60s  Right  Before that  Before that they would warn you  To avoid blacks  Yeah  At first all it said 
[02:35:00]  Was caution  Yeah  Not warning  It said it was caution  Cigarette smoking  Maybe hazardous to your health  Yeah  And then it turned into warning  And now I guess  They're going to start  Putting fucking  This product kills you  Yeah this will kill you  Yeah  Yeah  Oh but they loved  Their cigarettes back then  Yeah  I love Lucy  As a prime example  Every scene  When they're in the house  They're lighting up  Fucking cigarette  It was sponsored by  Philip Morris  Very acceptable  They would actually be like  Philip Morris  Philip Morris  Why would I light up

Right  Okay Rannells  And Rory O'Malley 
[02:37:30]  Josh Gad  And Nicky M. James  Who I'd say you were  Four of the five  Most important people  And uh  Without Michael Potts  I mean  I'd say that  Well you guys have always  Been obsessed with Michael Potts  Yeah I know  When I found out  He was a brother of his own  We got him in  Did you get him?  Oh yeah  He came in after  After you came in  We're like  You know what  After Josh left  We booked him  He said  He told me  He's like  They got me on the guys  That they wanted to talk  A Book of Mormon  But they really only wanted  To talk about the Y  It really was  We were like 
[02:38:00]  Hey Book of Mormon's great  Alright now  To the business of him  But uh  I'm a complete fan  Of uh  All of you  It's amazing  How good  I've never seen a musical before  I don't like musicals  Yours is fucking incredible  Thank you  Maybe they're all incredible  Musicals  If you've never gone before  Maybe you've never  Never thought of that  This is a pretty like  I don't know  Mamma Mia is just like our show  Mamma Mia  Literally  Exactly  Like those Mamma Mia Cats  Book of Mormon  Are the three most 
[02:38:30]  Traditional musicals  Do you know how disappointing  Another musical's gonna be  If I go to see it  And they're just  Fucking using  Proper language  And no one's being  Fucking edgy  Oh it's gonna stink  Only come and see our show then  Nikki you got the Emmy right  That's all he's doing  Tony  I mean the Tony  I'm sorry  She won an Emmy  She won an Emmy  Are they giving those one too  Last night I got congratulated  On winning an Oscar  And I was like  I've never even been in a movie  Thank you  Well congratulations on the Tony  Of course  Thank you  That's amazing  Anybody else get  Won't you all nominated  We were all nominated 
[02:39:00]  But it doesn't count as much  Oh that must be  That must be awkward  Yeah it is  Yeah we were nominated  And what's really awkward  Is she always holds it up  When we walk into the theater  She's living with her right now  Yeah  Carry her around with me  I had them build up  A special pocket in my costume  So I could wear it on screen  Yeah they could all look like  When they're all standing behind you  They can see it  So we don't forget  How did you guys not win  I can't comprehend  And again I don't know  What else is out there  But I can't comprehend  How somebody got more votes  You were great by the way 
[02:39:30]  I don't watch the Tonys  I saw your  I just  I saw your performance  It was fucking  It was brilliant  Oh thank you very much  Thank you  Yeah who knows  Who knows how those things  How annoyed were you  When you didn't win  I mean I love this  I was actually relieved  Because sitting there  You were sitting there  For like three and a half hours  And really hungry  And like hot  And like kind of  And they wouldn't give us  Any water  Josh actually  You could take water to the seat  It was very strange  Josh brought in a plastic bag  With goodies in it  Candy  And we were all like 
[02:40:00]  Oh that's so trashy Josh  And by hour three  I was like  Josh you got any more of that stuff  What you got in that bag  What you got  Give me some of them  Slim Jims  Did you really bring  Slim Jims in a bag  I didn't bring Slim Jims  That would have been amazing  I brought  I brought pretty  Pretty disgusting food  In there  But you know what  It really  It was very smart of me  Because by the end of it  Everybody really was  Paying with sexual favors  For ghosts  And so it was really good  For me it worked out well  Why would there no  How come you can't bring  Water to the seat 
[02:40:30]  At the Tony's  Because then I think  They want people  You know like  When the camera  Sort of pans a crowd  You got a bunch of people  Like drinking  Well I don't know  Who cares if someone's  Drinking water  That's why things  Like the Golden Globes  Are like  You watch this  They're all just like  Liquored up as hell  Yeah they just sit at a table  Drinking booze  And they're all fucked up  Trying to kill them  Stumbling over each other  Well that happened  There was another  The Drama Desk Awards  They tried to do like that  And they were like  They had like  Booze for everybody  And by the time  Our categories came around 
[02:41:00]  I was wasted  Wasted  Like they didn't really  Give you food  But like I think  I drank like  Whatever they would  We did shots  Did we do a shot of tequila  I think we did  Oh my god  And then I was like  And then there was a moment  Where I was like  Oh fuck  If they actually  If my name gets called  Where I'm screwed  Because  Hey  You're gonna have like a  Guns and Roses  MTV Music Awards  Knock it down  Knock it over  That would not be good  Nobody would be surprised though  That's the advantage  Of doing the show you do  Is if you probably curse  Nobody would be surprised  Because the show is definitely  We're supposed to be filthy people 
[02:41:30]  Yeah  We weirdly get called out  For it though  Yeah well Josh is just  I'm just disgusting  It's true  I would think you want work  You know  After this  At some point also  So you can't just be  A complete slob  In real life  Josh has built a career  On that  By the way Rory  We're obsessed  Obsessed on this show  With your moment  In Turn It Off  We do it out of context 
[02:42:00]  We never  No one in the audience  Knows why we do it  But there's nothing  Better to me  Than  Turn it off  Nothing  That makes me happier  Than that little  Hand across the neck  Turn it off  Oh my god  Is that great  After we saw it  We're in a cab  Just doing it over and over  It's all we were doing  With each other in a cab  Not that the rest of you  Weren't great  But  That one moment  That really got us  It was hilarious  We're both idiots  We're gonna take one moment  And just talk about it  That was the moment  She sung her ass off 
[02:42:30]  Holy man  People get kind of  Choked up watching you  Because  The songs are really  Brilliant and funny  And some of the stuff  Is so  I'm not gonna say  Harsh in a nasty way  But language wise  It takes you off guard  Absolutely  And then your stuff  Is just like  Oh  Like it kind of  Yeah oh yeah  That is what's happening  Over there  It is  I mean I get to be  The sweeter side  Right  The other flip  The flip side of the coin  Yeah  Which is fun  Which is great 
[02:43:00]  And fun  And I'm appreciative of it  But I sometimes wish  I got to say  Like some body jokes  And stuff  And really outlandish  It's not that easy  To be the straight  The straight man  When you're working  With like these hilarious  Yes but that's why  You won the Oscar  Isn't it  Yeah it is  The Oscar  And Emmy too  It had nothing to do  With the cleavage  Either  I'm like why does this girl  Have such low cut dresses  She is a sexy villager  She's fantastic  Absolutely  But this is what  A delusional ass I am  When Josh came in 
[02:43:30]  I'm like  Was she single  Like  Even if you were  Like let's be honest  You're around people  Who are in shape  This is not the route  She'd go  Is it  I don't know  I'd have to see  Your wallet too  Right  Oh shit  You're talking my language  An honest girl  She's direct  Oh god I love that  She's really acting up there  When she's playing  That sweetheart  We did an interview  The other day  And the first question  The woman asked me was  So how difficult  Is it to be nice 
[02:44:00]  Or something like that  And I was like  Are you implying  That I'm not nice  Yes  Yes  As a matter of fact  But you are really sweet  In that  You'd come off  As very innocent  And there's a  You know  A very funny moment  Where certain naive  Thoughts are revealed  By others  I can't say enough  About the show  So you don't want  To give away the jokes  That's why we don't  Play the songs  On the show  Because every song  Kind of catches you  Off guard  And the problem is  You can't get a ticket  For this thing  No  What's going on with that  Are you guys going to  Expand me  Tell us how to get one  Because we have trouble too 
[02:44:30]  No it's a problem  Where we sit  Because we're trying  To tell everyone  How great this show is  And then they're trying  To get tickets  And they're having a tough time  That's why I say  It's a problem  It's a great problem  I mean we sold  We were lucky  That we sold for  I don't know  Technically until when  But they do do  Now and forever  They do do some tricky things  Where like every once in a while  Like a new block of tickets  Will be like discovered  And released  If you have like  An American Express card  It's like the Dead Sea Scrolls  Yeah  Oh there you go  Every once in a while 
[02:45:00]  They discover new  That's so corporate  Man  But you know  There are tickets available  For 2013  If you're really interested  It's probably  You know what  You're probably not far off  Because you can't get tickets  The wait line for this  Is I was so happy  To walk past all the scum  Because I had a ticket  You're a privilege  I mean I walked past the theater  On my way here  And there was probably like  Ten people outside  Waiting for tickets for tonight  Really?  Yeah for standing room  Because if you get to the theater early  You can wait for the standing room line  It's first come first serve  Yeah  Wow  And they do a lottery  For the front row 
[02:45:30]  And then there's also  A cancellation line  I mean there's people who  There are ways  And if you can see it by yourself  There's you know  That's the best way  Go online and get a single ticket  Hopefully you don't have friends  I love when a show like that  Just really  Just becomes very popular  And it's pretty much  By word of mouth  Totally  And some of these other shows  That they just  Hype and hype  Bomb  Some of these other shows  Some of these other shows  It's kind of been  The brilliance of the marketing team too 
[02:46:00]  Because as far as I know  It hasn't been done before  That the less is more approach  Where people don't see anything  From our show  They don't see any numbers  They don't hear any music generally  And so there is this  Almost mystery surrounding it  The last show that was like that  Starlight Express  That's right  Skaters  Roller skating  It's a musical about trains  Oh fuck  Are you kidding me?  I remember as a kid  Watching that commercial  Even as a kid  I'm just like  What? 
[02:46:30]  Trains?  Really?  Well what's so great  About our show  Is that people  Who have never come  To see musicals  Are coming to see it  And loving it  And that's  That's not just good  For those people  It's good  It's good for our industry  To say  Hey  If we try to do  Something different  And completely original  Maybe a whole new audience  Will show up  That's to me  What was amazing  Just as a stand up  Watching people  In their 50s  And people that would  Find me repulsive  On stage  And to see what  They had constructed  To get these people  To laugh at  Like if these people  If you said any of those things 
[02:47:00]  Out of context  They would hate you  Yeah  But the fact is  You've almost cornered them  And now they can't do anything  But laugh at it  It's fucking amazing  The things that you guys say  That these people go with  It's pretty crazy  Like it's super confrontational  Actually  And you know  I have the  You know  Of the four people in this room  Who do the show  I have the unique pleasure  Of being part of  Two of the most  You know  Sort of  In your face  Numbers  You know  There's the one  Where it's like  Excellative you  God  Right  And then  The welcome to Uganda  Welcome to you 
[02:47:30]  The welcome to Uganda  Here in Africa  And these are the  And I remember the first night  Doing that in front of an audience  Because we didn't do  An out of town run  We only had done  Invited rehearsals  I remember being  Totally nervous  About how  The audience would react  And you can feel them  Sort of  Like  Fall back in their seats  A little bit  And then look around  At each other  And when they realize  That it's okay  Am I supposed to laugh  And then they go for it  Yeah  And it takes a minute  And they catch up with you  Right  So at first  They're like a little  Shocked 
[02:48:00]  And then by the end  Of the number  They're on board  But it is really  Confrontational  And a lot of those stuff  Is like direct address  So we're looking right at you  And saying like  This is  You know  This is what we're doing  Like either get on this train  Or you're going to be  Pretty disappointed  By the end of the show  That's exactly  You know what  It's almost like  It's so completely  Not apologetic  And it hits you so hard  So fast  It's almost like  Well this is exactly  What it's going to be  So if you don't like it  Fucking leave  Because it's going to get ugly  Because there's a line outside  Waiting for your seat  That's why you do it 
[02:48:30]  We should have a line  For walkouts  I've got two people  Walked out  You two can come in now  Have you guys had any  I'm sure you've had  Like you probably  Don't notice  If one or two people leave  Literally a handful  I mean no more  Than a handful  I think  I mean it is  I mean you know  I think we were all  Geared up for like  It was super shocking  And it wasn't  Although it is nice  Like you know  Even yesterday  We had two women  Sort of like  In the third row  Right in the center 
[02:49:00]  Who could not wait  To get out of the theater  Oh really  They were so pissed  And so  They left while we were bowing  They left while we were bowing  And I was sort of pleased  To see that actually  Because I was like  Well  It turns out it is  Like  People were like  It's not that offensive  It's not that  So we feel like  I think I  Am sort of  But I love that  I love like  The first act  Where the most offensive stuff  Takes place  They're like  This is disgusting  You know  We'll just stay  Through the second act  We'll come back  After intermission  But then we have  To leave  At the very end 
[02:49:30]  What's the point of that  We're going to make  Our statement  In the last  Ten seconds  When they're bowing  That's when we'll get them  That's when we'll go  We'll make our statement  Exit during the standing ovation  Smart  That's what happened  You know what's been  Really uncomfortable  Is lately  There's been like  Children  Little children  In the front  But not only little children  Little children  Who sing every  Fucking lyric  In the show  Along with us  And it's  So disturbing  Because you see  Like a six year old  Mouthing these  Disgusting words  With you 
[02:50:00]  Like god  This is terrible  Speaking of that  Who's obsessed  With toddlers  And tiaras  Oh  Right  Yeah  Yeah  I have not missed  An episode  It's the craziest  Despicable  Moms  And children  That I cannot get  I laugh my ass off  When they start crying  They're amazing  When they take headers  Oh my god  I know when they  Fall off the stage  That's always best  It's hilarious  That one girl  That fell off the chair  She just face planted 
[02:50:30]  Yeah  Like this is great  My favorite is  The mother of the  Fifteen year old  Fifteen month old child  Who's like  She's really gonna have  To step up her game  I'm like  Shit  Doesn't walk  It's a blob  They're just bouncing  In their arms  She can barely control  Her head  With whore makeup on  The whore makeup  Yes  And press on nails  Fifteen months old  Yeah  But what about  The male contestants  This is a glitz pageant  So we're gonna have  To really go all out  You're really a big fan  And get her  The fake eyelashes  Oh please 
[02:51:00]  I'm a huge fan  By the way  I think you guys  Watch it for a lot  Different reasons  Than he does  Thank you Jimmy  I have to be said  Thank you Jimmy  I like when they  Really have to  Shake it up  At the glitz  The glitz portion  But what about  The male contestant  Brock  He was like  He won everything  Because he was the only boy  The only boy there  And the contestant  And actually  His mom  I was like  She's a hero  Because she was like  You know what  This is when he feels  The most happiest  And when he's the most himself  When he's dancing on that stage 
[02:51:30]  When he's on stage  But it's so depressing  I love that  When they pan to that audience  And it's just like  An empty holiday inn ballroom  It really is  Just like full light  And it's a folding chair  There's one creep in the back  There is a creep  Just sitting there  That wanders in  In the bathroom  And it's just a saddest  And you're like  Why  It's not even like a full  No because the only people  In the audience  Are the parents  Of the other contestants  Angry fathers  Where is this  Angry fathers  Angry fathers  And some perv  What is it on  It's on TLC  Yeah TLC  You see the one 
[02:52:00]  With that McKenzie girl  She's hilarious  She's my favorite  I want a crayon  Mom  That's the one  That was crying  Yeah yeah  I hate McKenzie  I need my nini  My nini  She's screaming  My nini is a hard  Working lady  She's hilarious  Yeah she sounds like  She's 90 years old  She's smart  She's not smart  There is something  About that show  That is both horrific  And so entertaining 
[02:52:30]  At the same time  I love all things  Reality TV  Hoarders  We also really enjoy  Hoarders is great  The rat hoarder  Did you see that  Rat hoarder  I'll never  Stop having nightmares  We were a little bummed out  By that episode  Because we were wishing  It was going to be  Like city rats  Not the pet store rats  But besides that  It was a sick episode  I like disgusting  I like disgusting shit  More than just clutter  Yeah  Like I like  When they open up the fridge  And there's a piece of pork  In there from the 70s  What about the woman  Who was storing her urine  In jars  Yeah in jars 
[02:53:00]  That was disgusting enough for me  Or the staircase full of shit  In bags  In adult diapers  Adult diapers  And all I can say  We've had some of the counselors  On the show  Really?  And we say  Why don't you just smack them  In the face  Seriously?  You give them 10 minutes  To grab their shit  And then burn the house down  And they actually  She actually got a reasonable answer  She said  You know what  Everyone in their life  Is telling them  That that's what they want to do  And that's what they should do  She goes  We're just taking another approach 
[02:53:30]  Because that never works  Tough shit  But I would  I'd be like  Alright look  We're going to let the crew set up  Let's go out to  You know lunch  And take them out to lunch  And come back  To just a smoldering pile  Yes  I say you set the place on fire  And make them get out  Crawling over their own shit  It could be a new game show  Our old fat ass  Couldn't make it out  Yeah that's a shame  You guys aren't sympathetic 
[02:54:00]  To those people are you?  You're not sympathetic to them right?  No  To the people who hoard?  Yeah  No I actually  Like  I think being a New Yorker  And when you have such a limited amount of space  You take that space  To be so precious  And to see people have these houses  And just fill it up like a landfill  Giant houses  Ridiculous to me  We're going for plastic spoons  I mean I could  I do feel bad  I'm sorry  I do  Do you?  Yeah  I'm like  I'm like  You know I guess I'm too empathetic 
[02:54:30]  I do  But you know  I'm just like  What happens in her life  That makes her feel like  She needs  You know I get like that  I can't stand when  They're trying to clean the house out  They know that like  Either the kids are being taken away  Or the house is going to be taken away  And they're looking at one little thing  Going  Oh I have to make a decision  And it amounts to  One one billionth of what's in this house  And they're taking  Much too much time to decide on it  The state will take it  Throw it away 
[02:55:00]  Do you watch Obsessed?  The show Obsessed?  Oh yeah yeah  They've only done it  I don't have time to watch all that  I'm really  DBR  DBR  You got DBR everything  Intervention's another one  I love that  Love watching that  Although at this point  It's like  Who the hell is walking into that hotel room  Not knowing what's going on  Exactly  They're making a documentary  About addiction  That doesn't end that way  That's not like  Here's some more drugs  Maybe they're giving them drugs  They must be on some great drugs  Or maybe they just like  Don't pay their cable bill  Obviously they wouldn't have cable 
[02:55:30]  Because they're spending all the money on drugs  You know  Someone's thinking  We're assuming a dope shooter  Is up on all the local programs  Hello finals  Could you come  We just learned something today  We learned why  We did  We did learn  What time do you have to get up  Because I watch you guys  And I'm like  What time do you go to  I'm an insomniac  Like I literally haven't slept  In probably two  I just can't sleep  What time do you go to bed  To get up in the morning  I mean if we don't have  We were just talking about this  If you don't  If we don't have a matinee  Like yesterday we did a matinee 
[02:56:00]  Even if we do have matinee  We'll sleep until  I mean  What were we saying  10  10  11  What time do you guys go to bed  2  2  Yeah  You can't shut down  Especially after you do two shows  You're exhausted in between shows  But then there's like  This sick cosmic joke  Where after the second show  When you should be able to sleep  Yeah yeah  It's like  Alright now I'm ready to start a third show  Like there's no reason for it  That's when we drink  You're all wound up  That's how you wind down  That's  Too soon 
[02:56:30]  Last time you were in  I said  We were talking about Chevy Chase  He sat  I sat right behind him  At one of the shows  Oh yeah  Wow  And so I was  At Comic Con  Doing  This is what a self-centered  Phony ass I am  I was at Comic Con  Interviewing Joel McHale  And the whole cast of  Community was in the room  So Chevy  Walks by  And I grab  And I go  Hey  We interviewed  Josh Gad  From the Book of Mormon  And those guys  Were so happy you were there  And he didn't want to stop  And talk to me  Because he goes  Oh I love that show  And he's talking about 
[02:57:00]  How great it was  He goes  Yeah I went back  And I was like  Oh good  Can I take a picture with you  And he just deflated  Because he realized  The whole discussion  Had been a ruse  To get a photo  So I used your success  To get a photo  With a man  That he absolutely  Did not want to take  Nothing  And you saw it  On his face  He was like  Oh you fuck  I thought this was  A real moment  But you roped me in  Of course I did  Nice  Of course I did  He wanted to throw  His coffee in my face  Well he should have  People  I hear 
[02:57:30]  I've heard tell  That a few Mormon  Missionaries are using us  To get into people's doors  Is that true?  Yes  Wow  Someone  Yeah a cast member  Said a cousin of theirs  Called and said  These boys  Knocked  And rang my doorbell  And said  We're from  You may have heard  We're from the Church  Of Jesus Christ  Latter-day Saints  You may have heard of us  From our musical  On Broadway  The Book of Mormon  Oh my god  It's not very interesting  That the day after  We won the Tony  They launched that  Mormon.org campaign  I was like  Wow  This is good  You're opportunists 
[02:58:00]  That's smart  Have you guys gotten  Flack  Have you got any shit  From the church  Or no  No  They've been like  Kind of vaguely  Supportive  I don't want to say  Supportive  But they've sort of  Given us a pass  I think  They're not gonna  I don't think  They're gonna like  Stage any protests  Or anything  Even though it's  Making fun of a lot  Of stuff  It really does make  At least the Mormons  To me it makes them  Look slightly naive  About certain things  But it makes them  Look compassionate  It doesn't make them  Look like nasty  Or evil people  No we're not  No one was like  Setting out to make  Fun of Mormons  I mean it's not like 
[02:58:30]  It's not like a two  And a half hour  Warm and bashing  But no  I think at best  We make them look  Naive  But still good  Still good people  But your character  Is terrific too  Because you start off  One way  Like this idealistic guy  And then you just  Kind of realize  He's a bit of a  Self-centered ass  He's a bit of a  Guy who's kind of  Wrapped up in doing  Things so he looks  Good  It was just really  I didn't know you  Could do so much  Character development  In a musical  You often times  Cannot  We're very  We're very fortunate  With this one 
[02:59:00]  You guys all have  A lot of experience  In Broadway  I'm taking it  Yeah  Or on Broadway  Yeah  Did I sound like  A guy who doesn't  Know Broadway  When I said  In Broadway  In Broadway  Yeah we've all been  We've all been  Fortunate to be  Like you know  Kind of kicking around  For a while  And this is  You know  Obviously the  Sort of biggest  Opportunity I think  We've all had  Professionally  But yeah  It's nice that  We've all sort of  Been like you know  Working and kind of  You know  We all know  How lucky we are  To be a part  Of something like this  You know  Everyone is so  Grateful to show up  To work every day 
[02:59:30]  And that's  That's great  No matter where you work  But you know  We're really  We're really lucky  Well you guys also  It's like the cast  Member of The Wire  Like they have  The respect of their peers  I did a shoot  With one of the guys  From The Wire  And every other actor  On the set  All they wanted to do  Was talk to this guy  Who had been in The Wire  I mean you know  Ted Danson was there  All these  They wanted nothing  To do with me  They just wanted to  Talk to Dominic  Because he had been  In that  And you guys  Are going to have that  For the rest of your careers  You're going to be  We do a lot of people  Compare us to The Wire  Actually 
[03:00:00]  Except there's a few  More murders in your  Yes  Yeah  This is more violent  We do at least one murder  No it is true  We do get  I think  Our community  You know  The theater  The theater community  In New York  Is both  In awe of  Sort of what we're doing  With this ticket selling  Business is crazy  And that's not something  That happens a lot  And then  That we're doing it  And doing a show  That is both great  And we all  You know  Think is really  Innovative  And new  And we had some leeway 
[03:00:30]  You know  We created these characters  We're really lucky  To have been  Created these characters  From the ground up  And we put our stamp on them  So we're not doing  Anyone else's  You know  Show  In that way  Which is really  A lucky thing  But as a comic  You watch that  And you go  Like it is encouraging  Because you see this stuff  That you don't think  People can get away with  In the mainstream  In the mainstream  And they're getting away  With it on Broadway  And it's fucking murdering  I mean  I've seen the show twice  You know  Not that I would love  Another ticket  Despite my effort 
[03:01:00]  To promote  It's like  It's really encouraging  To see  Like there is a way  To do anything  You want to do  On stage  Any content  You want to get over  There's a way to sell  Well especially  When you're telling a story  You know  They earn  Every single moment  I think  You know  And these characters  Are rich  And you know  Like when you're  Telling that story  And all of a sudden  You get to the end  You know  Which is one of our  Most offensive  Quote unquote songs  The audience knows  Exactly what is being  Said up on that stage  You know  They've gone with us  On that whole journey 
[03:01:30]  So they aren't like  Oh this is  You know  Completely gratuitous  Or anything  They're with us  On that journey  Yeah there's a sarcasm  In some of the stuff too  Like where they're talking  About just the conditions  In Africa  It's about you know  What would you say  Missionaries that go to Africa  I'm one of the missionaries  And you can't deny  The truth  In what's being said  It's like  Oh yeah  It really is  A miserable environment  Yeah  And also I think  It's funny  Because people say  Do you feel offended  As a black actress  Do you feel offended  About the way  You're a black actress  I just thought you played one 
[03:02:00]  I spent a lot of time  In the tanning bed  That would be a funny revelation  That you're actually Irish  And you're just really fucking good  Don't tell anyone  Now we understand  Why you won the Tony  That's amazing  Was that movie from the 80's  Yeah when the guy  Takes the pills  To go to Harvard  Yeah I saw that  That's what  Oh god  Was that the worst  No but people are like  Are you offended  And I said  So offensive  What it really is  Illuminating  Which if you can get there  Is the first world's idea  Of what the third world is like  The sort of arrogance 
[03:02:30]  That we can have  As developed nations  About the ways  In which we can help  These you know  Poor unfortunate  Sort of hungry Africans  And the naivete  Of like what the reality  Of what these people's existence is  And so I think  The joke is actually  Flipped around  On the audience  And I hope they get it  But even if they don't get  That's the thing  That's really great  Even if they don't get  That second layer  They'll still think  It's pretty funny anyway  You don't have to be like  If you don't get  The deeper meaning  Hey this song's catchy 
[03:03:00]  Yeah  What's amazing  Is what you were saying  Also about the fact  That it is  You know  You get away with murder  And you get away  With some of the funniest  Material ever  And Rory talking about  The story  But along the way  Along the four years  Of workshopping this thing  I think some really funny stuff  Was left on the table  Oh yeah  Really funny stuff  Even songs that were  Perfect and hysterical  And it's a testament  To their craft  That they knew  That the story  Was the most important thing 
[03:03:30]  Right  And anything that  Serviced the story  Stayed  And anything that  Didn't went  And at the expense  Of I think  Some pretty hysterical stuff  Along the way  We'll do  Book of Mormon too  Oh yeah  Book of Mormon  Delete attracts  One day after the bow  Is there ever going to be  A heretic  Is there ever going to be  Like a DVD of it  Once it's done  Are you guys  Going to go on the road  With it  Or they'll get  A different cast  On the road  How many questions  Am I going to ask  At once  Jesus Christ  You're an asshole  Yes yes  No and maybe 
[03:04:00]  I mean yes  They've announced a tour  So there will be  A tour next  July  Probably with a different cast  But yes  So I mean  And then  In terms of filming  I don't  That's  You can go to  Lincoln Center  And watch it  Lincoln Center  Records every Broadway show  And they already did ours  So you can just go there  And watch the whole thing  You have to schedule it  You have to schedule it  They make you jump  Through some hoops  So now that you've seen  A Broadway show  You can go there  And watch all the Broadway shows  See what else  None of them are going to 
[03:04:30]  Because you hit  I couldn't  Like I heard  The person I talked to  Right before I went  I already had tickets  I talked to Colin  And you've destroyed  Other musicals  For me  I know you have  I'm not going to enjoy  Other musicals  Well Trey and Matt  We'll just have to write  Another musical  Specifically for you  Because this  It's like  I don't think I could  Have more fun  Watching a Broadway play  Well then you've never  Seen Joseph  And the amazing technical  Beauty and the Beast 
[03:05:00]  You want to go see that  Beauty and the Beast  Me and you  A little Beauty and the Beast  Little Mermaid  What do you want  Why not  I would go just to spend time  I love naming every Disney show  That's closed  None of the ones  I know  None of them are actually open  Just closed ones  Lion King  Okay  Trying to be nice today  Lion King  Yeah  Lion King  You can go see  Bobby Lopez's other show  Avenue Q  That's  I heard that was good  Yeah  That's great  Yeah you'll like that  And I saw the motherfucker  In the hat  That was a non-musical  With Chris Rock  Which I thought was very good  As long as there are curse words  You're in  Exactly  I just like salty language 
[03:05:30]  It makes me feel cool  We'll make you a list  And dangerous  Dangerous  I also love when Rory  When you get up and you go  I'm all better now  It fucking makes me so happy  Because you're obviously  Not all better  Yeah  It's such a great role  And by the way  Me just like singing  One of your lines at you  Is like me  As someone coming up  And doing one of my jokes to me  And if you want to spit in my face  Nobody would fault you for it  Everybody have an asshole  Please  I'm honored  I'm doing everything I hate  As an audience member  I'm a fucking audience member  I hate myself 
[03:06:00]  I'm a fanboy  And so you were all  On the ground floor  Of this  Like you said  Like all of you guys  Kind of were there  From the beginning  Yeah  We joined at different  Sort of levels  In the  Different stages  In the game  Josh and Andrew  Have been doing this show  For as long as  Rory  Josh and Rory  Nice to meet you  Sorry  What's your name again  Which one are you  So many white people  I can't keep them track  Yeah  Josh and I have been  For like four years  When it was  Half a show 
[03:06:30]  It was half a show  It ended with  The first act  It ended with  Man Up  And no chorus  Whatsoever  Supporting me  So it was just  My tepid voice  Going  Man Up  Over and over  And then it ended with  Man Up  It's the end of it  And then like the lights  Came up on the theater  And we were like  Alright well hopefully  This will be a Broadway musical  It's so weird  And then  We found  They found Nikki  For the second workshop  Just on the street  On the street  She was hooking  And then  And they 
[03:07:00]  They determined  You know  We want to get you  Out of this sad existence  And so  She just suddenly  Like changed the game  Completely  Because it became  So honest  And then  Over the next few years  It was really  It started to become  A struggle  They kept recasting  Price  And it just  Never fit  It never worked out  The way I think  That they had imagined it  And everybody was great  But then  Literally  Like right  A year before  We were going to open  They were  They were like 
[03:07:30]  We need to find  The right guy  And they had auditions  And they found  Andrew  I was also hooking  A different time  And  You completed us Andrew  The rest is history  Were you  Anybody else  In any shows  Of note  On Broadway  I was in  Jersey Boys  And you would like that  There's a lot of  Cursing in that  Is there really  Yeah  He's a Joe Pesci character  And  And Hairspray  I did Hairspray  You would probably  Not like that  Probably not  I heard Red was great  Like I never saw that  But that was one 
[03:08:00]  I would have seen  I would see  There's another one out now  I would see  Wicked  No  Jerusalem  Yeah Jerusalem  I heard is good  Phenomenal  I mean Mark Rylance  Who won the Tony  Was he really great though  Oh yeah  He's unbelievable  I haven't seen him  I love to shit all over him  But I can't  Because he's probably good  But I'm kind of in defense  Of you guys  It annoys me  He won in the other category  So it's okay  And then gave away his Tony  Which I love  Did he really  Yeah  You know you're good  When you can give away  Your awards  When you're like 
[03:08:30]  You know what  I don't need this  I'm going to win five  Is that a spur of the moment  Thing though  Like I mean you're on your way  I'm like why the fuck  Did I do that  I'm an idiot  I shouldn't have done that  So I guess  We're showing over  Oh yeah  Oh my god  Let's get the plugs out  For everybody  Otto of course  This is Otto  A brilliant comedian  Who is just enjoying the  Otto and George  Otto  Will be this Saturday  7 o'clock  Starland Ballroom  In Saraville  With the great  John Velby  You can go and  Follow Otto on Twitter  It's Otto and George  Myself ironically

[03:11:30]  It's almost like they don't know  What a great masterpiece they're in  Do you know what I mean  Or that they don't  Like this is the biggest play  In the world right now  Yeah  And they're just you know  Oh yeah we're just doing our job  We're just in the play  Yeah it's like talking to like  Cast members of like  Goodfellas or the Godfather  Before the movie came out  Yeah  Or the exorcist  You know what I mean  Before they realize  They're in something iconic  And you know it is what it is  Because like Josh Gad said  The first time he was in here  All the celebrities  Yeah  That go  This is one of those things  That like even people  Who are in show business 
[03:12:00]  Admit you know  This is the best  It is  And they're all nice people  And they're fun to talk to man  I enjoy them  Did you see it twice or once  Twice  And I'm going to go again  I would absolutely see it a third time  Wow  I mean  Because again  The first time the jokes  Catch you off guard  The second time you know  It's coming  But it doesn't matter  It's still funny  And the music is still good  Travis was looking at the website  And he said that  There are no tickets  To that thing  January is the first available tickets  But again  American Express  Occasionally will open some  That happens sometimes  They buy the tickets 
[03:12:30]  And then release them somehow  You know  I walk by the Book of Mormon theater  Every morning  Because my parking lot  Is passed there  And every single morning  Before 5 o'clock  There are people  Lined up  Sleeping outside that theater  Trying to get the cancellation tickets  They're there at  You know  4 o'clock in the morning  Nikki James is really hot  Like I'm really attracted to her  She's absolutely not  Attracted to you  Not at all  It's not mutual  No  Whatsoever  No  There was  No thank you  Alright guys  I gotta go  Because I have to be  Good luck on your audition 
[03:13:00]  Well Jim  As they say in the business  Break a leg  Well you know  That's my big comeback  It's okay  Your mind is on the audition right now  No it's not  I haven't slept at all  I was up playing chess with friends  Is it a good audition  Or is it a whatever audition  It's a very very  It's a good one  It's for a film so  Oh my goodness  Oh I'll see you guys  All this talk of plays  And movies  It's all so exciting  To be around this  Sam  Yeah Eric  When you're leaving  Do you ever see  It's not even the people  With tickets  That huge crowd  Of people waiting 
[03:13:30]  For anything  That the cops have to  Kind of regulate traffic  On 49th street  Yeah every day  They have barriers up  And the cops are just  Waving cars through  Dude  They start lining up  Before 4am  And then I think  Across the street from that  Is Chicago  Yes  Where there's hardly  Anybody waiting on line  Well Chicago's been there  Forever  And it's like  Every other month  They have a different celebrity  Just trying to  Drum up some kind of interest  Although I will say this  Ever since they moved  The Saturday show  Special delivery  To 8 to 10pm 
[03:14:00]  We get out earlier  So I get out  Of here  The same time on Saturday  That the Broadway plays  Are getting out  Chicago is always packed  Like when they  Let people out  They always crowd  That street  So you can't say  Anything about Chicago  No I'm not saying  That they don't get a crowd  But I'm saying  Earlier in the day  Yeah Book of Mormon  Is ridiculous  Book of Mormon is actually  Blocking traffic  With people waiting  There's no other play  On Broadway  That has people  Lined up  Outside the theater 
[03:14:30]  I almost said movie theater  Outside the theater  At 4 o'clock in the morning  Before  Like they sleep there  Yesterday  I was walking by  And  Now first of all  There's always a couple people  That I see there  Like every day  They're obviously scalpers  But there was one guy  Who obviously didn't exactly  Know how to rough it  Because everybody sits on  Like you know  Whatever  Little fold out chairs  Waiting for the ticket window  To open  And the ticket window  Doesn't open until the afternoon  So they're there  For a long time  One guy actually brought  An air mattress  And had his bed sheets on it 
[03:15:00]  And was like sleeping  On the sidewalk  On his giant air mattress  With bed sheets  And a pillow  And a pillowcase  As if it was his room  How did the police  Not do anything about that  Like I understand  I mean people line up  It's not like a homeless guy  That's bothering people  Or something  But how do they just  Allow you to  Live right there  On the sidewalk  Because as long as  Like people line up  For stuff like that  All the time  Whether it's you know  Gaga doing the  Today show  Or whatever  It's like you know  It happens all the time  It just happens to be  That at Book of Mormon  It happens every day  Here comes Roland 
[03:15:30]  I would like to talk to Roland  Let's see if he's  Are you coming in?  Is he coming in?  I hope he doesn't go around  He's coming in  Roland  What's wrong?  Yeah  The tickets  For your hand  Yeah?  Well since  Some people want them  Yeah  It's going to be  A rough one huh?  Somebody got pushed back  Well  It is what it is  You know  It's happening  What can you do?  Complaint  Are you going to?  I'm just too tired today  Well right now 
[03:16:00]  You would be tired  Yesterday  The A-listers of Hollywood  Ryan Reynolds  Jason Bateman  And Guy Ferry Stakes  And Guy  Well  That's the A-listers of Roland  Today  The A-listers of Broadway  The Book of Mormon  You have  The hottest celebrities  In the country  Stopping by the  Opie and Anthony show  On a regular basis  At this point Roland  Joe McHale's coming up soon  Oh my god  I was about to say  How do you top yourself  But you do it  By bringing the hottest guy 
[03:16:30]  In TV here  And he's doing  No radio  Only the show  And the guys  From the movie  Yesterday  From the change up  They did a little bit  Scattered out  Throughout the rest  Of the platform  But like  The other channels  Got like five minutes  Maybe with them  Yes  What about these  Book of Mormon guys?  They're on their way  To a meeting  And then  They take a nap  Then do a show tonight  So they just did our show?  Did our show  Then  How do you convince  These people  Because  It's not a good idea  For some people  I mean people  Assume  That it's a bad idea 
[03:17:00]  To do this show  It's a very toxic show  I mean the interviews  Are always fine  Yeah  Nothing ever happens  How do you convince them  To do the Opie and Anthony show?  I'm like David Copperfield  They're gonna reveal my tricks  Yeah  I like it  Because you never know  Who's gonna be listening  That's right  So  You can't reveal your tricks  Because then they'd realize  I do the Crissangels  Just look weird  That's just Roland  Bullshitting again  Are you  Are you pleased with yourself  This week?  Was this a  Was this a good Roland week?  Yeah  I forgot to call Rich Ross  I apologize for that  I want to just  Talk to you about that  Well he texted me 
[03:17:30]  He goes  I would even forget  To call myself  Roland came in here  Because Opie and Anthony  Go to break  And they say  Oh coming up next  Otto and George  And Rich Voss  Are gonna be joining the show  And everybody goes  Yay  Hey two great comedians  This is gonna be fantastic  We go to commercial break  And Roland  The Ron and Fez  The Ron and Fez interns  Are setting up  The studio right now  And one of them  Is having a little trouble  With the sign  It's okay  It's a difficult thing  With his pull in  Pull out  There you go  He got it 
[03:18:00]  He got it up  So  Roland comes in  During the commercial break  And he says  Hey guys  So how about that  Fishbowl event yesterday  Hey wasn't Guy Fieri great  And he just starts listing  All of his accomplishments  From yesterday  And we're all looking at him  Like  Yeah  Good job  Roland  And Roland goes  Yeah  Well  Just think about that  Because  I forgot to call Rich  Yeah  He forgot to call Voss  We were supposed to have 
[03:18:30]  Otto and George obviously  And Rich Voss  On the show today  We plugged them  We announced them  We had prep sheets ready  And as it turns out  Roland  30 seconds before Voss  Was supposed to come on the air  Remembered that he hadn't called Voss  I have to say that Voss  Was a classy enough gentleman  To say  Tell them I overslept  So they won't bash on you  Was he  So but now you know that  Now you just announced on the air  That he didn't oversleep  No no  Well I already told them  The truth  What happened 
[03:19:00]  Oh okay  I thought Voss was kind enough  To say hey  If you want to get in trouble  Right I gotcha  Yeah no but he'll be here Monday  Voss will  Voss will be here Monday  Are you going to call him  Or maybe you'll forget  I already talked to him  I said this is it  If I forget again  So  Is it a humiliating feeling  When you realize that  You've forgotten to do that  I mean luckily  Your week was strong enough  That you could afford  To lose a Voss  Oh my gosh  Why is Jim Norton  Still walking around here  Oh he's going out  The other way  Probably J. Boneyard 
[03:19:30]  But I thought he was auditioning  For his big Hollywood movie  I wonder if he's acting  With George Clooney  Probably not  Because Clooney's  Somewhere else  Already filming  Well he's only auditioning  George Clooney doesn't have to go  To the auditions  I don't think  For everybody  What movie is him  He didn't say  What's going on in there Eric  Rob Cross walked in  I didn't know he was in here  He starts talking  Do you leave the mics on  Well we were in the conversation  And I was looking at something 
[03:20:00]  With my mic on  And all of a sudden  I turn around  And he's there  He starts talking  As far as I'm concerned  You should always leave that mic on  It's just funny  And then if somebody comes in  And wants a private conversation  You could just do that  Just turn it off  In the middle of it  Okay  Or if it's not somebody  As important as Rob Cross  Just leave the mic on  The whole time  Don't even tell him  Okay  Sorry Sam  Did Rob just say sorry  Yeah  Sorry Sam  You don't ever have to  Apologize Rob  I didn't know you were  I didn't know Eric  Was part of the conversation  I walked down the hallway  And I missed the part 
[03:20:30]  Where Eric was saying something  Well he's always part  Of the conversation  Rowan  Is this show going to be  Part of Tuesday's meeting  With Gary  You know  Rob  Maybe you should have  Your meeting  Did today's show  Go okay for you  It was fine  We got an XMU plug in  Right  It was awesome  Okay good  That's the way you see it  Any mention is a good mention  I tried to sell the channel  I mentioned some of the bands  And everything  Sell it  You sold channel 35  Better than anyone else  Possibly could  And you didn't  Well  I mean in that context  I should say  You did not make mention 
[03:21:00]  The fact that  Pat Carney from the Black Keys  Would be co-hosting  Afternoons  Every day next week  From 5 to 6 p.m.  Eastern  Or the fact that  Wow  Bjork will be  Soon making a week long  Co-host appearance  On the channel  Bjork  There's a lot of stuff  Going on  Now tell me this  Are there any  On air positions  Available at XMU  I just need to know  When you're not on another channel  And we'll put you in  Okay  I'll actually have to look  At a schedule for that  You can have your conversation  Actually  You know what  Like all shows you do here  It will be without compensation 
[03:21:30]  Well thank  Thank you for  Letting me know that  So I don't have to ask  Any embarrassing questions later  And the  Safe trip for Liam  He's going to Chicago  For Lollapalooza  He is  Yeah  Coldplay  M&M  Coldplay and M&M  Didn't it used to be like  An alternative music festival  But they needed to sell tickets  Oh I see  That's the problem  And since nobody listens to alternative  Like  XMU  Could probably set up a good  Festival  But  It's a niche audience  Yeah you need Coldplay  And M&M  For people to go  Oh I'll go  How come you're not going to 
[03:22:00]  Lollapalooza  I love Coldplay  Because I'm moving  Oh so you got no cash  Dude no  I'll tell you this  I'm glad you're moving  And you want to know why  Why  Because yesterday  You had Guy Fieri's grill here  I did  And you said you can't take it  Because you're moving  That's correct  So I picked that thing up  And carted it up  Three flights of steps  In Westchester, New York  And it's proudly placed  In my kitchen  And Randy got you  A security pass  To get it out of the building  You and Eric  Were a big help 
[03:22:30]  I took Guy Fieri's grill  And I'm going to be  Grilling chicken on it  Spencer came in  The other talent guy  And he goes  What are you going to do with that  Why would you keep  I said you can put chicken  On this thing  And you can grill  Your vegetables too  I like raw vegetables  Really  Yeah  He looked at me like  What  It's grilled vegetables  So delicious  I like  Well I'm not going to  Describe them  Because it could be used  In reference to a penis  What I did want to do though  Was go back to something 
[03:23:00]  That was talked about  Today on the show  They didn't get to play this  I felt like they kind of  Wanted to  But they didn't get to  Because it was long  We shortened it  And I'll tell you why  Because I know  Ant says  That when he's listening  To After Open Anthony Live  Anthony hates  That the bits are so long  He goes  Why are these bits so long Sam  I'm listening in the car  Saying  When does Sam  Come back to talking  So since he's one of the hosts  Of the show  Wait  What  That's what he said 
[03:23:30]  I think so  I mean I was sitting right in  That's what he said  That's what he said  In context yes  In context  Yes  Eric you gotta  Get the cake out of your ears  Yeah I have  All my notes are wrong  He's gotta get the cake  Out of his ears  Get the lard  I love when  Roland makes fat jokes  About E-Rock  It's my favorite  People need to realize  That Roland and E-Rock  Ever since Roland  Like started working here  He shares an office  And they're  They're brothers  Like they just  They laugh  They hang out  And they pick on each other 
[03:24:00]  They're brothers  Like that's  That's accurate  Isn't it  I have a fat brother  Eric you heard  Yeah I heard  Ask him how many people  Walked in on him  Sleeping in the recliner  Yesterday  When were you sleeping  In the recliner  Most of the afternoon  That's  Meat coma  Oh yes  Those assholes  Yes  People knocked on the door  Guys girls  From the programming floor  Coming in  Saying how great  The food was  And Roland's 
[03:24:30]  Just kind of like  Leaning over the side  Of the recliner  Oh that's true  Almost drooling on himself  A bunch of assholes  Talking to me  You're in a meat coma  Plus you'd boozed  Yourself up nicely  So you needed  A little nap  Yeah they're like  Hey so what's it like  To shut up  I'm tired  I'm going to sleep  And then  No well never mind  We won't say that  What won't you say  No  Having an argument  Over a piece of equipment  That was in our office  Oh yeah  No  Why bring that up  Water under the bridge  As far as I'm concerned  Or water  In my kitchen  Now 
[03:25:00]  The beginning of the show today  The very top of it  Replay starts at 3pm eastern  We talked about Steve the Whistler  Steve the Whistler  Is a guy who did the show  Years ago  And this is probably  Our most infamous  Bad guest day  It's my favorite  Bad guest day  And a favorite  Of most of yours  I would hope  We looked at his website  We saw what he's doing  Now Roland  What do you think  The odds are  That we'll be able  To get Steve the Whistler  Back in here  For a 
[03:25:30]  For a  Reunion  Really  Really  Look  Pretty high  You got Ryan Reynolds  You got Book of Mormons  You got Jason Bateman  I bet you this guy's  Going to be a dick to me  That'd be tough  Yeah he's like  Well I don't know  If I can do mornings  I generally don't do that  I mean I don't know  How many  Do you have any ratings  Do you have  This is Steve the Whistler  I'm sure he'll be back soon  Before we break  Oh before the  Little summer break  We're going to have  Can't wait for that  Steve the Whistler  Well  Yeah  Do you want to 
[03:26:00]  Explain where this  Starts off at  You know what Eric  Because that whole thing  Was 32 minutes long  Why don't you  Explain  This starts off  After  Just like back then  Going through his website  Talking about his car  And his license plate  You know the thing  About the O.B. and Anthony show  Is the longer you listen  The less you have to listen  Because eventually  We just start doing  The same breaks  Over and over  And over again  So he's at the website  So he's at the website  We're reviewing the license plate  Talking about his CD 
[03:26:30]  The competitions  Which at this point  Was the first time  They heard that there was  A world whistling competition  So they're discussing that  But this starts  Right when  We're going to play  His instrumental tracks  And he's going to  Perform live for us  In studio  This is the greatest  The guy we talked about  First thing on the show  This morning  I don't even remember  How he came up  Did he play clips?  Steve the Whistler  Yeah I don't know  Just in case there's  Still some bad blood  Or whatever  Only right here  On After O.B. and Anthony Live  After O.A. Live

[03:30:00]  Whistling lessons  I can't believe this  Do you have another copy?  I see you're looking  Do you have another  Well not of that particular one  Damn it  But we can try a different CD  With a different kind of thing  Alright let me  Try this  I want to hear this song  It sounds beautiful  And there seems to be  A problem with the CD player  Steve  It's not all dollars and cents  What's wrong Steve?  No I was saying  You were playing the  The Broadway and Beyond CD before  Weren't you?  I thought I heard  Oh yeah yeah  But it was skipping  It was skipping  Skipping 
[03:30:30]  The first track was skipping  Is it our equipment?  Because then I would really be  Flabbergasted  I'm mortified  Let's try it  Mortified  Let's try it again here  Alright  One more time  That's not going  Stuck  Oh Jesus  Nice tone though right?  Yeah that was  I apologize  Alright 
[03:31:00]  Well Steve I think  We're going to have to  Just take your word for it  Well either that  Or do something  What do you have  Do you have another CD  Of music?

Say goodbye to your T-cells everyone  Steve the Whistler  Alright  Sounds like it's working  He's got a website  SteveTheWhistler.com  Yeah  International Grand Champion 
[03:32:30]  Here comes  Second  Whoops  We got farther that time  Yeah but this CD player  Is just ridiculous  Yes Jim?  I would  Would it be possible  Could you whistle  Singing in the rain  While I'm raping a girl?  After ONA 
[03:33:00]  Live  It's after Opie and Anthony Live  I mean we just give you a taste here  We just give you a little bit of it  We played it recently  The whole thing  On a Worst Of special  And I'm sure  That someone as special  As Steve the Whistler  Will be played again  Roland are you going to try to  Book him back in here?  Yeah  You are?  Yes  I mean if you could pull off  What you pulled off this week  I don't see  I'll try again for next week  Why that should be so difficult  For next week? 
[03:33:30]  Next week  That's pretty good  While that segment was going on  And I don't know if  Roland you caught it  Or Eric caught it  Because it just like  It was kind of just a fleeting moment  And then we went on to something else  I think we ended up talking about  Green Day next  But  Just as we were talking about  Steve the Whistler  And starting to  Get out of that  Norton  Said that when he was a kid  His friend  Jacked his dog off  Onto Norton's arm  And like we didn't have 
[03:34:00]  A big conversation  About this  I don't think they wanted to  Because  What type of situation  Because  I mean it wasn't like  Jacked off the dog  Which means what  You just leave your arm there  Waiting for the dog  To climax  Well it turned into  Then Norton  When he was drunk  Would go to this  Motel  Right  And would just eat food  Off the carts  And trays left outside  But they focused more on that  Than  The dog being 
[03:34:30]  Jerked off on him  This sounds like a script  For 20 days later  I can understand  I can understand  People getting drunk  And eating off room service  Trays  Roland  I'm sure you can relate  I have been  Almost blacked out drunk  And then never crossed my mind  Eating  And back in my mind  Like don't do it  What about  I bought  I spent  $200 at McDonald's  Wasted in Vegas before  Really?  Yeah  How do you spend  $200 at McDonald's?  When you say  Six and ten of this  Ten of that  In your head  Because 
[03:35:00]  It just all sounds so good  I was  I was retarded  That was like  Oh I wish we had it  That was like the time  It was a few years ago  It was when Steve C  Was still the executive producer here  He goes  It was my birthday  And he goes  Sam  What kind of food  Do you want for your birthday?  I remember this  We can finally like  Really tell this story  He goes  Because  He used to get breakfast  For everybody's birthday  But he knew  To make it  Look like he was  Really doing a good job  So that everybody 
[03:35:30]  Would appreciate him  You don't have to take shots  I'm not taking shots  We're just explaining  Well  He knew that  I don't eat eggs  So I don't eat omelets  So it's not like  I don't eat tradition  You know  I eat waffles and pancakes  And stuff  You can always find  Something for me  But  What happened was  He said  Alright Sam  Well where do you want  Breakfast from?  And so I said  I guess we can get  McDonald's breakfast  And of course  Eric and Travis and Danny  Were all  Helping me with this  Saying it was a great idea 
[03:36:00]  So he goes  Okay we can get  McDonald's breakfast  What do you get  At McDonald's?  And I go  For breakfast?  Yeah  Chicken biscuits  I mean you gotta go  For chicken biscuits  And Steve goes  Okay so we'll get  Chicken biscuits  For your birthday tomorrow  I go  Yeah  He goes  Okay  Hold on hold on  Hold on  This just  Goes to show  It's a classic example  Of Steve  Listening but not listening  Steve was  Yeah you're right  Because  He was at times  Not all the time  But many times  Easy to manipulate 
[03:36:30]  Because  He'd know what you said to him  He just took whatever you say  As fact  Like he goes  Okay  Like there's no processing  It's just you tell him something  And then he goes  And does it  Without thinking about it  That was a good point  Because  He goes  Okay so you want  Chicken biscuits  For your birthday  I said yeah  And I go  And you know  Maybe a couple hash browns  And some drinks  For the guys  And he goes  Okay so we'll get like  What  Eight drinks  And I go  Yeah just get like  Eight cokes  And he goes  Okay  And I go  Yeah just get like  Whatever  Just like 
[03:37:00]  One order of hash browns  Per person  And he goes  Okay  And then he goes  How many chicken biscuits  Do you think we should get  And I go  I don't know  Fifty ought to do it  I guess  Never even questioned  What he  What you said  Like wait  What  Fifty  Right  He goes  Okay  Wrote it down  Pulled out a card  Gave it to an intern  And just sent him on his way  He goes  Okay  Fifty chicken biscuits  He goes  No  He goes  Should we call McDonald's  In advance  To make sure they have  The fifty ready  And I  Nah  I just go send the intern 
[03:37:30]  And lo and behold  Well you know  What Steve's main concern was  What  Well make sure I get a receipt  Yeah just make sure I get a receipt  The next morning  An intern  Comes to the studio  With a paper bag  For McDonald's  Containing fifty  Chicken biscuits  Remember that big table  We had  Oh we had two huge  Um  Like picnic  Style tables  In the K-Rock studio  In the far back wall there  Mm-hmm  Whose idea was it  To tell them to come in  And just dump them out of the bag 
[03:38:00]  Onto the table  Well I'm sure that sounds like  Something I would have suggested  Because I wanted Opie and Anthony  To see  My birthday celebration  And the fifty chicken biscuits  Uh  I don't know if  Anybody's around from that era  Danny Travis or whatever  If you wanna  Add on to this story  Feel free  Because  Do you know  Were you  I wasn't there for that one  You weren't  Yeah you were  Was I  It was K-Rock  Yeah you were there with us  You had to  Maybe you just don't remember  Because  We got fifty chicken biscuits  Dumped them all over the table 
[03:38:30]  Do you know how many chicken biscuits  I ate that day  One  Exactly  I had  One chicken biscuit  Some of my coke  And no hash browns  I don't even think  Five were eating  Yeah because  People had the hash browns  And the cokes  But I don't think  Anyone really ate  The chicken biscuits  We dumped out the chicken biscuits  And then people like  Were like  Ah  No I don't really eat  Like  Opie, Anthony, and Jim  You all hear them  They eat healthy stuff  They go  No I don't want any chicken biscuits  Half the staff doesn't want any chicken biscuits 
[03:39:00]  They went down and got regular food  From somewhere else  And Steve was stuck with  Forty-five chicken biscuits  I don't know  Who brought them home  Somebody brought the entire bag home  Probably Steve  Who was interning for us at that time  Do you have any recollection?  Nah  I don't even remember what year that was  Hmm  Had to have been  Two  Probably  Two thousand seven  Two thousand eight  One of those two  It was towards the end of the K-Rock years  I think  But uh  But yeah  So I think an intern  Ended up bringing home  Forty chicken biscuits  In a bag 
[03:39:30]  Because we just  He just would buy  Whatever  Whatever we told him  I mean it was  Yes I am  That was one of the great things  About Steve  Because after  Steve took a brutal beating  On the air  For something that wasn't done  Or a guest that wasn't booked  Or something wasn't planned right  Steve's idea  Was  I'll make it up to the staff  By  Doing something  Be it getting a cake  Getting breakfast  Buying lunch  Buying fifty chicken biscuits  Exactly  But he'd never  Really think it through 
[03:40:00]  Like I did this  Everyone should be happy with me  No Steve  You bought fifty chicken biscuits  That no one's gonna eat  Somewhere  Someone must have a picture  Of the fifty chicken biscuits  I think I might  Look around  I have to  I'll take a look  Cause it would  That'd be great  If we could tweet out  That picture later today  Uh  Because that was  I mean  One of my favorite moments  Of all time  It was for your birthday?  Yeah  It was definitely  September 6th  Of some year  I don't know what year it was  But I mean  It was one of those things  We didn't do much with it 
[03:40:30]  On the air  I mean did we  I think  Obi and Anthony  Might have mentioned it  Maybe  Do you remember  I think they interrupted  Going  Why the fuck  Is there chicken biscuits  That no  And then they would talk about  How they smell great  But nobody would eat this  And how bad  They were for you  You remember when Steve  Booked the palm  I told him  I go  Hey  Slash Bear Cohen  Is requesting the palm  If you can book it  Uh huh  It's just a joke  It was just  But he booked them  That's the expensive steakhouse  Yeah  Remember they  Got the chef of the palm  In  To cook for us  And then  That was just something 
[03:41:00]  You kind of wanted  So you lied  I was hungry  Yeah  Yeah I mean  That was the other point too  That like  I told them  That I needed  50 chicken biscuits  And Steve or me  Nobody ever told  Obi and Anthony  That all these biscuits  Were going to show up  In their studio  So we just poured them out  On the table  In the middle of the show  And they don't know  What's going on  The inmates are running  The asylum now  But  It was a great time  Um  Eric  I wanted to  Play a tribute  While we have time  Um  We lost a 
[03:41:30]  We talked about it  On the show today  Uh huh  We lost a great actor  Yesterday  Great football player  What were you going to say  Wrong one  Bubba Smith  Bubba Smith  Yes  Um  We looked at some of the  Stuff that he's done  Miller Lite commercials  We played on the air today  You want to  Hear that  Check out the replay  But  Uh  What we  Didn't play  Was  How we have  Paid tribute to him  In the past  Uh  He was a part  What year was this 
[03:42:00]  Do you remember Eric  That we  That we did this thing  Uh  This had to have been  2009  It was 2009  In the month  Of February  Black History Month  And we were celebrating  With some of the  Black icons  Of entertainment  And  Hightower  From Police Academy  Was one of those icons  Uh  Of course  Played by the late  Great  Bubba Smith  So I thought it was  Only fitting  That on today's 
[03:42:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live  Even though  Technically  It's no longer  Black History Month  I celebrate that month  All throughout the year  And today  We can too  As we  Remember  Bubba Smith  And this  Our tribute to him  For Black History Month  To celebrate  Black History Month  The Opie and Anthony Show  Is recognizing  Those historic  African Americans  Without whom  This country  Would not be  The melting pot  It is today  Today  We honor  Officer Moses Hightower 
[03:43:00]  From the Police Academy  Film Series  After years spent  Organizing Orchids  Hightower felt  It was time for a change  And left the flower shop  To pursue a career  In criminal justice  I got bored  With my chosen profession  What was that?  I was a florist  A florist?  You know  Flowers and shit  In spite of his  Massive stature  He was a gentle giant  But there was  That one time  Where he posed  As a voodoo-crazed  Serial killer  To tease new recruits  Yum-a-yum-yum-yum-yum  Yum-a-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-y
