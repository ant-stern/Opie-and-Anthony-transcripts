<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-course.  The show opened with in-studio guests Robert Kelly, comedian, Keith (who resides in Anthony's house), and Big A.  Initial banter included Kelly's stand-up experiences (complaining about entitled white women), Anthony's apparent firearm addiction and tactical clothing obsession, and Keith's prolonged stay at Anthony's house, including the implication he does Anthony's laundry.  Anthony vaguely alluded to participating in “missions.”  This was followed by a discussion of an Upper West Side home invasion and a call to action for listeners to submit videos of themselves killing the character representing Steve (a staff member) in Grand Theft Auto 4, with numerous graphic descriptions of these video submissions following.  A shocking video of a 500-year-old Indian baby-dropping ritual was then discussed, leading to a tangent on bizarre Indian and Chinese food practices, including a dish referred to as "cootie pie."  The hosts then revisited Pat Duffy's fight with a construction worker, detailing the altercation with graphic and comedic descriptions of Duffy's rage. The segment concluded with mockery of Hillary Clinton's appearance and the perceived lack of charisma in presidential candidates.

The show continued with a discussion about young Republican presidents, descending into offensive stereotypes and conspiracy theories about various presidents and Henry Kissinger. This was followed by the "FU Line" caller segment featuring angry voicemails.  Afterwards, the hosts discussed *Iron Man*, "Global Shutdown Day," and the multiplayer aspects of *Grand Theft Auto IV*, highlighting its graphic detail and in-game television.  A significant portion involved a phone interview with Dana Beal, promoting the Worldwide Marijuana March. This interview was punctuated by increasingly bizarre and offensive tangents on marijuana legalization, 9/11, and Ibogaine. Beal's age and advocacy were repeatedly mocked.  The segment ended with discussions of technical difficulties, the show's "Afro War," a nephew’s prank on his aunt, promotion of the "Traveling Virus Comedy Tour," and Opie’s upcoming trip to Guatemala, including safety concerns and humorous anecdotes about his preparations.  Offensive language and jokes were prevalent throughout this segment.

A later segment featured Bob Kelly discussing his upcoming trips to Guatemala and Iraq.  The hosts expressed safety concerns about Guatemala, joking about Kelly blending in with outdated clothing and a beard.  A trucker, Dave, called in with a hazardous waste joke.  The conversation shifted to Kelly's Machu Picchu trip, with humorous speculation about orgies and encounters with local women. Kelly's weight loss and its impact on his comedy were also discussed.  A Guatemala travel warning was read, leading to dark humor about organ harvesting and child kidnapping.  Kelly promoted his CD "Just a Tip" and upcoming shows.  The segment then transitioned to Anthony's "Supercar Weekend," with sexually explicit humor about his life, his wife's tolerance, and fantasies involving the event.  Kelly recounted traumatic childhood experiences involving physical and emotional abuse from his stepfather, including graphic details and his stepfather's infidelity.  Caller Dana shared a story about her mother sleeping with her husband, resulting in further sexually explicit and crude discussions.  The segment concluded with more discussion of Kelly’s abuse and promotion of various media and show information.

Another segment featured Dana, who recounted her husband's affair with her mother nine years prior, leading to a graphic and sexually explicit discussion of the event.  The hosts scrutinized Dana's MySpace page, including her mother's profile.  They discussed her apparent apathy towards the situation.  The conversation frequently veered off-topic, covering Kelly's Guatemala trip, his experiences with Brazilian police and prostitutes, a critical listener call, upcoming tour dates, and a bizarre video of a Dutch comedian with a child.  The hosts speculated about the video's nature.  The segment concluded with encouragement for Dana to leave her husband and sexually explicit suggestions.  Bob Kelly and Otto were in-studio guests during parts of this segment.

The final segment discussed Chris Benoit's chilling voicemail messages obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.  The hosts and Bobby Kelly reacted with shock, morbid humor, and discomfort.  The conversation involved vulgar and offensive jokes, graphic sexual descriptions, derogatory comments, and discussions of their personal lives, including Kelly's sex life and Anthony's plans.  Brother Joe called in, promoting his stand-up shows and impending fatherhood. The segment concluded with further off-color jokes, discussions of a listener gathering, promotion of Brother Joe's appearances, numerous mentions of AshleyMadison.com, and Otto's unique perspective, including his description of his radio show’s superiority to a "mongoloid" audience.

[00:21:30]  guy i procrastinate a lot so having people uh that like keith you know he's an in charge guy  uh and his wife stuff like that he can come in and take care of business procrastinating a lot you  you and your former girlfriend ordered a couch that got delivered to your house in september of  2006 yeah until she left what a month and a half ago two months ago yeah it sat covered in plastic in  the corner of the room with the flat panel tv on the floor with a mets beanbag that's what you guys 
[00:22:00]  lived on a mets beanbag are you guys doing meth it looks like a crack house i don't get that why  that's not procrastinating dude that's beyond being lazy you're you're absolutely right that's  problematic yeah you're right he must have a meth lab in his that i've seen the basement man you could  easily hide a meth lab down there it's just that it's huge his his basement is bigger than his house  how do you get that done it's underground underground parts to it that have nothing to do with the house 
[00:22:30]  i think where the bomb shelter goes well i understand you know once the war starts i'm  gonna you're into batting down the hatches jeez he's afraid of bombs they're not dropping bombs  it's uh and then of course the uh pool project there this got me a little uh it's got me a little  p.o'd yeah why i'm telling you i think uh keith's gonna have to start uh cracking some heads  over there what happened well they're permits it's permits for the fence that has to go up before 
[00:23:00]  anything starts and and there's a permit that says a town permit you know and it said a fence  installer and that wasn't good enough because it had to say fence erector what yes yes let me see i  have the email oh yeah it's so so what happens that that means rip up the permit and start all over  again and try to get uh a permit with fence erector on it instead the bureaucracy oh yeah you got it yeah 
[00:23:30]  it says listen to this horse crap you can send the corrected line of fence bond rather than fence  erector license you submitted on the bond to a one-page writer from the insurance company doesn't  even make sense no it doesn't make sense you read it and go what it's something that you read eight  times and go i have no idea what this means can i put my fence up god damn it just put your own  fence up yeah well no that's problems right there oh really yeah because then the fence police come and  gotcha you're not allowed to just put a fence up in here no you don't own your own house you don't 
[00:24:00]  you don't for some reason people in this country think they buy a house and you you own the land  like a uh paw ingles you know you can't you can't do anything on your own property you're not allowed  there's so much uh crap there with with permits and everything that you just gotta you can't you don't  own it you can't even paint it you can't cut trees down you can't do anything on your own property  without having to alert the town and and then get permits and and they can deny you things 
[00:24:30]  it's like what i bought this property god damn i don't see i didn't see them helping with the  mortgage it bring up a good point because i live in a condo and i'm thinking about uh knocking out  my windows in my living room and building a porch on the outside of the building yeah it's just to keep  extending out yeah like a tree fort because when you build a tree fort as a kid it would just start as a  thing and then it would expand all over the place i'm thinking of expanding to that branch up there  because i got terrific views i'm i'm way up there in the sky and i figure i want a porch a little 
[00:25:00]  outdoor space i own the place right so i'm gonna knock out the windows i'm gonna hang a bucket from  my 36th floor and extend it i'm gonna do a little extension uh project why not where do i where do i get  the permits for oh good luck on that one uh big thing sticking off the side of their building  well you're in a condo right yeah i'm in a co-op i don't even own i own the air you own inside of  the apartment yeah no you own shares of a building shares yeah that comes down to yeah well all right 
[00:25:30]  you can't do anything you don't really own your actual you can't do anything no i can't do anything  without them uh without their the whole board agreeing on it isn't that great oh and they are  all on a power trip yeah a couple i actually like i've been to one of the board meetings and let me  tell you dudes i don't believe somebody hasn't made a sitcom about that disaster really just every race  creating colors just going at it and they're out of their minds like and the people that are in there 
[00:26:00]  i don't know how they get in there because it's pretty expensive building to buy a joint you know  a studio is like 400 000 and some of these people are so like they don't have anything to do in their  life anymore and this is what they do oh great they just mess with the board they keep oh really yeah  the board is is just like ope said on power trips to keep people from doing what they want to do  just because they can but they'll argue for weeks uh to change like garbage pickup to wednesday  from a from a tuesday and why like the dumbest stuff hey we gotta take a break we can continue with

[00:27:00]  now you can hit the button i was gonna do something but why don't you take it because  you know what you're doing down the hall and i don't go ahead hey good morning you're checking  out the opian anthony show hola  we're all adjusted um people are starting to send in their videos of themselves killing steve 
[00:27:30]  in grand theft auto 4 were we laughing in the office watching some of these this is probably a  little too inside for most people but it's making us laugh pretty good uh by now a lot of people know  that um a lot of us most of us from this radio show are in uh gta 4 but bobby you're in it right  yeah uh yeah what are you in uh gta 4 some mob guy uh some some mob guy in the later levels  yeah he gave us uh all like you know a little cameos which i think is really really cool and uh 
[00:28:00]  people have found steve and the staff found steve right away and they uh secretly hate his gut so  what they do is um secretly a secret it's blatantly blatantly at this point sure so they  they're certain they searched out steve that was the first thing this game is just amazing  and they needed to find steve that's the that was the only thing they they thought of they found 
[00:28:30]  steve and they started killing him so we decided that uh the listeners need to do the same thing and  if they do a good killing we'll promote their videos that are up on youtube and on on our website  so this one guy sent one in he found steve and he's throwing flamethrowers at him yeah molotov cocktails  right right right sorry and then uh and then steve is on the ground just completely just burning alive  on fire screaming screaming and then the guy pulls out his his gun and starts shooting rounds into steve as  he's as he's on the ground on the ground on fire shooting steve's flaming screaming body 
[00:29:00]  people hate steve in this game it's become it's become the uh obsession here on the open anthony show  you bump into him and he talks yeah he's like get away from me and you bump into him again he goes  stop i know how to use this yeah don't make me yeah and he pulls his gun out and the second he pulls  his gun out the guy lobs a molotov cocktail straight at his face and then screaming flaming steve yeah 
[00:29:30]  runs around and then falls down and he unloads on him and then after he's burnt up and shot he walks  over to the guy to steve and pulls a knife out and starts stabbing his dead burnt body  i don't think anyone's gonna beat this one that's a good one what is this video labeled uh yeah here's  some audio of steve in the game now you're in trouble that's it yeah because you bump into him  and he just comments oh he throws out a bunch of little jacks me no one jacks me he throws out 
[00:30:00]  little comments and he's a pudgy cop it's heaven missing an angel what it's my prius  these are lines as as the cop is it  oh he has another character yeah yeah okay well so look fat hairy fist eat my fat  yeah and that's anthony's commercial that'll get us thrown off the air because it's the uh 
[00:30:30]  unedited version so so people are uh finding steve killing them and putting them up on youtube  the one we just described is labeled gay bear steve i like how his little legs started kicking  when he was on fire oh he's on fire he's just yeah kicking falling down hey we're back with the uh  dropping of the babies what a sensation this video has become screw steve screw gta 4 for now  uh this is the greatest video to come out in i don't know years years and the news people they 
[00:31:00]  just don't know how to handle it uh in indiana is it yeah india they're dropping babies from 50 feet  and they're they're they're bouncing off like a tarp is it india indiana india indiana you think  they allow anything like this to go on in this country they they pull a sheet very tight and then  uh they they drop these little babies little newborns it looks like from 50 feet up off the roof  of a mosque little papooses and they hit this uh uh sheet and bounce and then they you know take 
[00:31:30]  them off yeah back to the parent i guess here's the story all right a 500 year old indian ritual is  causing a stir around the world take a look it's the annual tradition in salipur india tossing a baby  50 feet off a building the infant falls onto bedding stretched tight by people below now the natives say  they do it because they believe it will bring their babies good health they also say no baby has 
[00:32:00]  ever been hurt they say yeah look at that i can't watch either you know i'm getting sick of the indians  i really think they're just making up these rituals because they have so many kooky they do they well the  problem is they have so many gods that they got to have a ritual for every every little thing you  know every little god they got and they're running out of things to do so like i don't know uh drop  babies that'll that'll that'll uh satisfy one of the gods one of the billion gods we have yeah  that'll satisfy the chick with eight hands it's good luck it's not good luck it's good luck until 
[00:32:30]  one of the baby's spinal cords just snap off the impact yeah like you're not supposed to shake babies  excuse me so i hear i'm here to say that they've been doing this for 500 years and they've also said  that not one baby has been injured that's crazy in the ceremony first of all and then somebody in  place for 500 years someone actually said after that well something's bound to happen  something bad is bound to happen but it's been 500 years damn it something is bound to happen 
[00:33:00]  if you eat ice cream i bet yeah i bet they started it last tuesday i bet they were like what do we do  now we don't kill cow we don't kill rat we just throw babies off a building yeah why not you know  they eat that you know what the cootie pie is no what's that no these these creepy people over there  they actually because you know like the chinese and the indians they just get i don't know i think  bored with themselves they just eat whatever yes they got some awful food it's the it's actually a 
[00:33:30]  goat fetus no way but they have to i swear to god it's still in the sack and they have to wait it has  to be not too old not too young because if it's too old it's hairy and if it's too young it's not tender  enough or it's too tender so they have to get it a certain and they actually comes in the the actual  sack from the uh mother and they cut it open and it looks like a little baby goat and they chop it up  and make a cootie pie oh cootie pie let's see pie why don't we get some of that some cootie pie yeah 
[00:34:00]  who's gonna eat it i don't know well pat duffy but i think he's in jail today i don't know i heard  yeah there was some kind of altercation pat f and duffy the uh the star of the baby bird video  the star of the uh homeless homeless underwear mustache mustache yeah uh what happened to pat  duffy yesterday rocky got some communique um pat kind of lost his temper and uh got into a fight  with a construction worker that's insane right there these construction workers in new york are 
[00:34:30]  the real deal man but he lost his temper over something that like what happened pat he's just  should have just walked away oh thanks um i was crossing the street at 40th and 6th and i was  watching a guy a construction worker drink soda from a soda bottle and he was like six feet away from  the garbage can and he threw it at the garbage can and it landed on the ground next to it and it just  really made me angry and i snapped he snapped because someone littered in new york why would he add to 
[00:35:00]  the problem what problem to the problem it's a bit the city's disgusting and he just had to add to it  it just made me really first of all what was it a soda bottle or it was coca-cola okay so it was a  soda bottle you don't think a homeless guy in two seconds is going to pick that up for the nickel  deposit well i didn't didn't think that far i thought when i read this email i thought like the can hit  your leg i thought maybe yeah yeah some of the soda splashed on you mind your own beeswax you kind of 
[00:35:30]  fight with a construction worker because he was littering yeah yeah when did you become green  i've i've always been earthly i just it made me really angry and i just snapped and then what  happened that's captain planet what happened then um well i i i picked up the bottle and just one  motion before i even realized i was doing i threw it at him as hard as i could and you never really  have aim until a situation like that and it hit him in the shoulder and splashed him in the face  and then he came after me of course he did you're an ass i know and how good was the fight 
[00:36:00]  it was well he shoved me all right and then i came immediately back at him and shoved him with  every ounce of strength in my body and he went slammed against the wall and then you guys just  went into one of those little outhouses and made out pretty much yeah that's exactly what happened  they used the bottle you see the look he gave you as he said yeah pretty much that's what happened  we just man kissed real heavy that's really passionate clanging teeth king king so you  pushed him really hard and then what happened yeah then it got sexy and then we rolled around a little 
[00:36:30]  bit yeah and then his hat fell off and then a policeman with a really tight uniform came over  used his nightstick on us it was great that was awesome now what happened and then he like he came  back at me as if we were going to fight and i got it right in his face and i said don't even think  for a second that i'm afraid to effing kill you wow and then he and then he just started to back  off he's like all right man all right and then i just kept walking you're a psychopath there's no  doubt about it we got to start paying this guy he's he's losing it now oh sorry guys yeah i really 
[00:37:00]  lost total control of myself yeah so what's up i'm really stressed out lately that's all yeah what's  up then i'd say that pat duffy is an asset to the show but to say this incident increases his  hirability well i don't want him coming after us yeah he's obviously a bit on edge uh maybe because  he's been working for free for the last 18 months yeah wow yeah it was better to snap there than here  i think god when i read you don't you don't pay this guy no we have we have like 12 guys on staff 
[00:37:30]  this guy they finally said no we got away with murder when we first came back to radio we're gonna  need uh four producers we're gonna need uh we just gave him a list of demands they said okay okay  okay and finally they said all right enough guys you got like 12 people behind this yeah but this guy  let a fat guy puke in his mouth yeah i know that deserves something yeah the internship that he's  currently uh you know that's all we promised him what are you guys vh1 never promised him a rose

[00:58:00]  the top ten but what the heck is up with paul abdul yeah exactly exactly exactly that's what we're  talking about yes and the number one surprising fact about barack obama i have not slept since  october i believe him winzak winzak innocent fun with barack obama how about something about uh 
[00:58:30]  reverend right yeah that would have been funny like what i don't know they could have came up with  something i'm sure they did come up with a few yeah and obama's like absolutely i won't read that  we know a few of the guys over there and i think they probably had a few reverend right lines i won't  read that why don't we i don't know let's see if we'll read it who knows you don't you never know  i i i can't uh both of them barack and hillary i just can't i honestly think uh mccain's a shoe-in now 
[00:59:00]  i really think after these two battle it out and it just becomes republican against democrat and  either one of those two against mccain you'll just see like oh wow they really didn't have much of a  chance in hell but what's probably going to happen is that one's going to ask the other one to be the  vice president and then you're going to have trouble yeah mccain's not going to be able to beat both of  them it one's going to be like look just jump on the ticket and it's going to be the first black and 
[00:59:30]  first woman something and that old relic that that marionette mccain won't be able to beat him  marionette that's the worst thing you could call him oh he is he's on a string well his hand yeah  his arms don't come up very high so it's almost marionette ish yeah i guess you're right i'm sorry  and i hate that every time you make fun of him they're like dude he was a war veteran who cares  so isn't rambo i think a lot of people care bobby yeah i mean there's a lot of  my dad was the guys in the military that liked the show and held captive for six years yeah by 
[01:00:00]  my mom but did he carry a watch a watch he'd give me the watch it was in my ass i kept his watch  oh sorry yeah well what's the end you can't do that you can't say you can't say no no not like that  you can't say in that context oh no yeah oh all right anything um you know anything  in on through day that becomes like you know even resting on like a coaster yeah yeah can't  can't let's go to duncan rhode island you're on the opian anthony show what's up duncan hey good 
[01:00:30]  morning boys how you doing good hey good uh i just got a quick question for anthony oh anthony uh just  wondering yesterday you're getting on hillary's case for uh not knowing about red bull but now  obama and who i'm not necessarily supporting obama's making jokes about american idol and doing a silly  uh top ten and you want to hear serious issues about reverend right what's up do you honestly  think barack obama wrote those no of course not and it's actually i think it's typical of other 
[01:01:00]  celebrity top times i think we're pointing out the the hypocrisy in all of them and and uh what is  one thing what is the hillary not knowing what red bull is have anything to do with obama doing the top  ten it seems it it seems that you're getting on hillary for not knowing pop culture and now obama's  doing some silly pop culture wise and that and you asked why isn't he talking about reverend right  it seems opposite angle oh we're just uh they could have made something funny about reverend right is 
[01:01:30]  what i'm saying and he just uh it's obvious that obama's camp said you know i'll do this top ten but  i'm not doing any lines about reverend right saying he should have gotten up there and you know  started preaching again about uh how bad the guy is oh that's cool that's cool dude punch it out  duncan who are you voting for hillary uh any anybody anybody not republican yeah there you go  so what does that mean is it going to be obama or hillary it'll be either of them i guess  unfortunately i think they all stink frankly you you really haven't decided though well 
[01:02:00]  i haven't i've decided it's going to be democrat why do you got to get stacy one of them abortions  all right i think i just i i mccain is four more years abortion that hasn't been working  yeah i don't know all right duncan thank you four more years of bush huh he's not four more  years of bush i mean he has a little more integrity than bush has bush is just a redneck who owned a  baseball team yeah mccain seems like he does have a little more integrity he has a little more  integrity a little bit a little bit i think what he's getting at is like another old white guy in 
[01:02:30]  office but what's wrong i hear that all the time do we really want another old white guy in office oh yeah  because uh they've really ruined uh the country up until now yeah one is a little more of an a-hole  than the other one and bush has just been a complete douche but uh what's what's why does  old white guy have such a negative uh how about young station to it how about young white guy young 
[01:03:00]  white guy i don't know if he's not experienced he wouldn't qualify either yeah but they don't have  to be experienced actually they're surrounding themselves with a bunch of experienced people  it's not like he's actually making decisions whoever's in there isn't going i think this  that's the way it is he's being told what to say anybody who gets in there even mccain  is being told what to do what the best option is and you should do this well even if he goes i think  we should do this they go no no no do this yeah but they have advisors yeah and they pick their  advisors it's not like this this group comes in like uh bill says the illuminati comes in and starts 
[01:03:30]  uh advising him the president picks his advisors and and he's going to pick advisors that he's  thinks he's going to advise him the way he wants to uh be if i could say it again advised  who's the last uh i was enjoying every every advise who's the last who's the last young  republican president young republican president who would be perceived as ron reagan as young uh 
[01:04:00]  wow i know i'm i'm going back i can't think of one when clinton was young rutherford b hayes for  the democrats kennedy was a young one kenny was yeah but he was a democrat no i know i'm just saying  the democrats had have had a couple of young presidents who was the last young republican  president was he young he wasn't voted in yeah oh gerald ford ford ford wasn't young he wasn't 
[01:04:30]  voted in yeah we didn't want him yeah no one wanted him jesus i'm gonna go with just a couple of crooks  though that were uh i'm gonna go with james k polk you're going with polk actually he was a democrat  it had to be one of the wigs oh the wig party yeah one of the wigs look now we're back in the  paintings wait it's not even pictures anymore we're we start you have to go back to painting  i mean start from not that beginning the other side yeah you know what i mean all the way all  the way all the way down all the way down and now we're gonna go backwards backwards all right you got 
[01:05:00]  bush all right then uh yeah bush's uh father no reagan no uh ford wasn't young richard nixon was  he richard nixon always looked older than he was he was old though let's be honest then you make my  day too eisenhower no jfk uh the worst herbert hoover calvin coolidge we're we're this far back

[01:16:30]  of people that you know are our home like they're home and play at playing because you can have one  guy driving the car then you can have other people that are just online like hooked up and and they get  in the car and they could do drive-bys yeah that is and stuff that's so bizarre to me so you just  throw a mouth of cocktail you can go like a like more than two people can play at once like me you  and three other people can yeah yeah we could all be in the same car really and uh yeah tear it up a 
[01:17:00]  fan yes up to 16 people could play together in one in like in one room yeah and we can all just go  around and smashing steve in the face and light them on fire you could smash other people that are uh  playing live yes yeah so you can i see you play there's also the regular pedestrians as well like the  the city still yeah they're all still in there like the uh the computer generated players right  but then there's other players that you get to kill like call of duty you know online you're still  you're playing against other people if me you and fan and opa plan we can we play as he is it like

Hey, chick name.  It's Jimmy Spit.  Yeah, we were excited to talk to you, but you're like a dude.  Yeah.  So, dude.  Yeah?  So what's this about, man?  Well, we have this marijuana march in about 235 cities. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, man.  Some places it's big, some places it's small.  In New York, it's fairly big.  Dude, what's it like?  What do they do, man?  Well, you know, this is the marijuana arrest capital of the world, D.R.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're proud.  Right on.  So we decided we'd have a protest.  Whoa.  A what?  A protest.  Oh, against the arrests.  Yeah.  But don't you do this every year? 
[01:23:30]  What?  Yeah.  Don't you do this every year?  I can't understand what you're saying, guys.  Oh, do you do this every year?  Well, we've been doing it since 1972.  So I see it's...  Some years it's big, some years it's bigger.  I see it's done a lot of good.  See, because since 1972, there's more people...  Well, a guy came along named Rudy Giuliani. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Who's he?  What did he do, bro?  9-11, 9-11.  9-11, 9-11.  What did he do, though?  9-11, 9-11.  Yeah.  But what was that about?  America's mayor.  Yeah, no, that's cool.  But what did he do about...  It was good until he ran for president.  He crashed and burned.  About, like, pot.  What does that have to do with pot?  Yeah.  What does it have to do with pot?  Yeah.  9-11.  9-11.  Well...  Pot will outlive 9-11. 
[01:24:30]  What?  Yeah, right over there.  Pot will outlive 9-11.  Well, that's...  9-11 is now receding into the past, but pot is coming from the future.  Pot from the future?  Yeah.  Dude, that will get you so effed up.  Mm-hmm.  Future pot.  Imagine, like, if you could get pot from the future.  Yeah, what's that about?  How cool that would be.  What's that all about?  Dude, do you realize we could just be...  Our whole universe can just be a molecule underneath our fingernail? 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  And, like, we can be living in...  Underneath some giant's fingernail.  Oh.  Well, maybe we are.  Then what?  And we could have, like, an entire universe under our fingernail.  How...  Wow.  What?  What?  What?  Are you so high?  What?  Can I buy some pot from you?  What?  No, I'm afraid we can't do that. 
[01:25:30]  No, you don't sell?  So...  We can't do that.  Yeah, it's against the law.  What are you...  What are you trying to do with this march?  Yeah, like, accomplish and stuff.  What do you want to do?  Well, actually, see, we have no...  We have no chance...  No.  No.  You have no what?  No chance to change Rudy or Bush.  But we're making some changes at the UN level.  But Rudy's out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  Bush will be out soon.  Yeah, so they'll be out. 
[01:26:00]  What time is this?  After that, we'll see what happens.  But, like, what do you want?  We want to make it so that pot can never be illegal again.  We want to legalize it and make it so it can never be illegal again.  Forever and ever.  Yeah.  Like part of the Constitution?  Nice.  Like a constitutional amendment?  Yeah.  That would be good.  That says that you can smoke pot.  That's what I was saying.  You know what I would do with the Constitution? 
[01:26:30]  Dude, I would cut off a piece and roll a big fatty with it and smoke.  Imagine smoke and weed.  That's so symbolic, isn't it?  I think a First Amendment would be good.  Yeah.  What?  When is this March?  Well, it starts in Tompkins Park at 11 in the morning.  Isn't that funny that there's a march in May?  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  That is so effed up.  Anyway.  What?  We march out of Tompkins Park at 145 up First Avenue to the United Nations. 
[01:27:00]  At 145?  Yeah.  Wait.  We start at 11?  Go home and watch Gilligan's Island.  That's a little early, bro.  Well, you don't have to get there right on time now.  How about 4 or 5 in the afternoon?  Yeah.  Well, 4 or 5 in the afternoon, they'll still be going on.  I'll be in dog commerce.  We'll park them.  Dude, you know what happens, though?  The cops are there with cameras, and they take pictures of you, and then they keep them  on file.  No, they don't.  And then they look.  No, dude, they do.  They'll make a couple arrests, though.  They do, dude. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  What happens if we get arrested for smoking weed?  If you get arrested for smoking weed, you will probably go to Central Booking over.  No, during the marijuana march.  We could just smoke weed, right?  Not, but...  What?  Well, it's better than it was.  Let's put it that way.  Yeah.  Huh?  It used to be 325 arrests.  It's gone down to two.  Two?  Two what?  Two.  Arrests.  For what?  Pot.  Where?  At the march. 
[01:28:00]  What march, dude?  The marijuana march.  Oh.  Holy mackerel, man.  You're freaking me out.  Are you suggesting that we raise a generation of super kids?  I don't know what would lead to super kids.  Dude, is the...  I think there'll be regular kids.  Is the march going to be going until the clock strikes 420?  It actually goes until 630.  Oh, so then at 420, is there going to be like a big like, yeah, dude, it's 420. 
[01:28:30]  I would rule.  You know what that means, don't you?  Um, well, 420 was Hitler's birthday.  Yeah.  That's high times.  They like to celebrate Hitler's birthday.  With pot?  We do the first Saturday.  Is that where 420 came from?  It just happens to be Hitler's birthday.  But I always thought that's really strange.  I mean, do the potheads want to dance on Hitler's grave?  Dude, now you're freaking me out. 
[01:29:00]  Dude, did you wake and bake?  No.  You don't wake and bake?  No, I take melatonin.  What?  I take melatonin and it's ready to go back to sleep.  Do you smoke weed?  Yeah.  Only at night.  At night?  Yeah.  Why?  To go to sleep?  No, that's when I kick back.  Dude, you don't just party during the day, smoke a little weed.  Well, if you smoke a little weed, you don't really get high.  Maybe you. 
[01:29:30]  You're smoking the bad stuff.  I don't know.  I think it's fairly good.  I got the Carl Spackler Feather Benz.  Benz.  Feather.  Benz.  It's Kentucky Bluegrass and California Centimiga.  You can play 18 holes on it and then get just stoned at a bejesus belt. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know.  I used to be able to smoke pot in the air.  But then they curtailed pot smoking at WBAI.  Oh, BAI was a great station.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that sounds like a lot of fun to go down to the march and maybe get arrested.  It's very unlikely you'll get arrested.  We have more fun now.  Unlikely.  You got our support, dude.  You know that.  Anyway, if you want to come over, meet us in Tompkins Park. 
[01:30:30]  What day?  Saturday.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Saturday.  It's Saturday.  Or 11 in the morning.  All right.  Or noon.  Or 1.  Just get there before the march leaves or you'll miss it.  Sounds good, bro.  All right.  Should I bring my little pocket bong?  Well, don't admit that you have a pocket bong or they're going to get you for public display.  This is the marijuana arrest capital of the world. 
[01:31:00]  You said that already?  I forgot.  You do realize you said that already, right?  It is only relevant if you get arrested.  We get it.  You like pot.  Obi, I don't think he just likes pot.  He loves it.  I prefer it to alcohol.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alcohol gives me a hangover, man.  I like both.  All right, sir.  And heroin.  Pot's just a stepping stone to bigger drugs.  And that drug is crystal meth that we need now to get the show back on track. 
[01:31:30]  You know, everybody knows the ultimate drug is ibogaine.  Oh, shut up.  Ibogaine turns junkies into potheads.  Shut up, please.  Turns junkies into potheads?  Yeah.  We have this drug that turns junkies into potheads.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Reverse gateway effect.  Wow.  Do you have a drug for boredom?  Well, I assure you, if you take ibogaine, you will not be bored.  All right, great.  Wonderful.  I'll take ibibored. 
[01:32:00]  All right, sir.  All right, man.  Good luck with your march, dude.  Be there or be square.  Wow.  Dude, did you come up with that?  No.  That's so cool.  Who came up with that?  Tom Forsad, the guy who founded High Times.  Yeah, he's a good...  Came up with everything.  420?  Yeah.  For his birthday?  No, Steve Hager came up with 420.  Sammy Hagar?  What?  Sammy Hagar?  Well, you know, Steve Bloom claims that he came up with it. 
[01:32:30]  Steve Hager claims that he came up with it.  Steve C?  Yeah.  Steve C did?  From Foundry?  No, Bloom Hager.  There's no C in there.  Bloom Hager.  Oh, Bloom Hager.  Yeah.  Steve Hager, Steve Bloom.  Right on.  They have this big...  I don't know who you're talking about.  420.  You're talking about...  Chuck Yeager?  No.  Steve Hager.  Funny.  SB, thanks.  Chuck Yeager.  Well, can we go now? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Can we leave?  Are we free to leave?  As long as you show me the pot that's in your pocket.  I don't smoke pot, sir.  I'm an adult.  I kind of got past the pot thing a long time ago.  How old are you, Dana?  Oh, I'm old.  I'm much older than you guys.  How old are you?  I'm older than the hills, man.  Give me a ballpark.  Yeah.  Oh, how old are you?  I'm 44.  Flerf.  I'm afraid I got about 15 or 16 years on you. 
[01:33:30]  Okay.  You're like around 60 and you're smoking dope.  Why do you still smoke pot?  All the old people I know smoke pot.  Why?  Like what?  All right.  We were fishing around.  Now we got some.  60 years old.  60 years old.  You're smoking pot.  Jesus, dude.  Do you live in your parents' basement?  No.  What are you doing?  Seriously, Dana.  Well, um.  What are you doing?  And like if you want to smoke pot at 60, I guess that's okay. 
[01:34:00]  But to be like this pot activist guy at 60.  Yeah.  Aren't there better causes?  I mean, if people want to smoke pot, that's fine.  But aren't there better causes?  Actually, I work on the Ibogaine thing.  Ibogaine?  Ibogaine.  What's that?  Rogaine?  The stuff that turns junkies into potheads.  But why would you want to do that?  It's like a zombie drug.  We have a one-dose cure for heroin.  A one-dose cure for heroin?  Right.  You take this drug.  Are you selling something now? 
[01:34:30]  And then.  You're selling something.  You're not on heroin anymore.  The establishment, man.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you, man?  You're part of the problem, not the solution.  Well, it took a long time to get 235 cities together.  I'm sure it did.  It's all the pot you're smoking.  60 in the 60s.  He's smoking pot.  I mean, Toronto has 20,000 people.  Rome has 50,000 people.  That's good.  That's good for you.  Rome?  All right, Dana.  What are you talking about? 
[01:35:00]  What are you talking about?  Dana, thank you so much.  The marijuana march is happening tomorrow, whenever you get there, right?  Yep.  Just show up.  Have a blast.  I mean, it's actually a lot of fun.  Have a blast?  It's Coke, too?  No.  So you get it?  They call it a blast when you do some Coke.  Coke was when I was a lot younger.  I quit that.  Yeah, because that's immature.  I smoke pot now.  Keep smoking, Dana.  Yep.  Keep on smoking. 
[01:35:30]  I hope you guys keep on smoking, too.  Hey, Dana.  Hey, Dana.  What?  Bah.  Bah.  Dude, you said there's a march in May.  I almost fucking lost my shit.  What's wrong with you?  We're still on the air?  We're still on the air.  Yes, we're still on the air.  I haven't been taking a break.  The thing was panicking.  What was you?  Sorry.  Bobby.  He was holding up a break sign like it was like a pro harmer. 
[01:36:00]  You said F-ing.  You said F-ing.  Good thing you didn't drop the N-bomb, too.  What the hell's going on with you?  I thought we were off the air.  And you were complimenting, Anthony, on the march in May.  Ah, march in May.  Let me tell you something, man.  You said, hey, there's a march in May.  That's cool.  I almost lost it.  I'm sorry for swearing.  I thought we were off the air.  I saw F-ing's little break sign going crazy like the star-spangled banner.  And Opie's little giggle was...  I was trying to be really obnoxious and over the top, and a few people did not appreciate 
[01:36:30]  that.  I wasn't trying to be like an accurate pothead.  I was trying to be really obnoxious.  Oh, you guys were definitely obnoxious.  There's a march in May.  Wow.  Wow.  Dude.  Then you turned on him.  You both had a mood swing at the same exact time.  Yeah, because then you realize, like, why is he so into this?  I mean, I know a lot of people that smoke pot, but I...  There was a time I was into pot. 
[01:37:00]  It was cool and stuff, but I don't know.  The guy's, like, pushing 60 if he's not over 60, and he's really obsessed with pot still.  I love stuff.  It's a little weird to me.  Pot's only cool...  Like, when I used to smoke pot, it was a bag of it.  We'd lock ourself in, like, a tool closet for an hour and a half and smoke the whole  thing, and come out and pretend you're airplanes and walk around the street.  Yeah.  The only time pot was cool.  Smoking a little joint to relax.  Shut up.  All right.  You guys are funny, dude.  We did ya.  Did ya? 
[01:37:30]  What?  Just blown up his...  Grow up.  Just blown up his dumb march.  Gives a crap.  Just smoke your dope.  Smoke your pot.  There's a march in bed.  Wow.  Well, he's in trouble.  Coming to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the first annual baby throwing contest.  Stay tuned for details.  Thank God.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I gotta tell you, I'll take you inside the show a little bit. 
[01:38:00]  The phones are extremely slow today.  Like, extremely.  Usually, we get in here at six, and the phones are lit.  Everybody wants to talk about something.  They're slamming.  And lately, that's pretty much been the thing.  I mean, every day, phones lit the whole show.  And today, extremely light.  Like, barely getting phone calls.  Which doesn't make us feel too good about what we're doing.  And then I, Dan actually said, was it you that said maybe people went out late drinking last night? 
[01:38:30]  And they felt like, they didn't feel like calling the show today?  Or they're sleeping in?  And I actually, I'm reaching for straws.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Maybe that's it.  All right.  And then another hour of, like, literally, the phone's not ringing.  Like, every once in a while, one does ring.  So then, Dan, like, checked it.  And the phones aren't working today.  Hey, it's a struggle every day around here, man.  And it doesn't have a computer that's working.  Today, it's the phones.  Danny looks like Michael Corneone's bodyguard in Italy. 
[01:39:00]  That's a good look, yeah.  Fabrizio.  What the hell is happening with Danny?  I'll tell you what happened.  What happened, Danny?  I grew my hair so long that it was making my new era fitted hat very, very tight.  And I needed to go for something, a little more play.  Yeah, we got this Afro war going on.  And, you know, a lot of guys were in it in the beginning. 
[01:39:30]  Than gave up a long time ago.  And he had a huge mountain beard when he finally decided to stop growing his hair.  Because it went from Afro war to just grow everything.  And right now, we only acknowledge, like, Sam and Eastside Dave in the contest.  But Danny is in this thing.  But we don't give him any credit.  We don't give him any air time for this mess.  Look at that.  He looks like all the three stooges.  That's the look.  Like all the three stooges.  At one time, right?  At one time.  Oh, my God, dude. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  That is a look.  Dude, did you just invent something?  What do you mean?  He just looks like a...  Mad scientist.  Look how crazy that look is, man.  Mad scientist.  Can we get a picture of that?  Throw it up on onaradio.com?  Because we are the most visual radio show in America.  That's right, Liz.  I would walk around like that.  All you need is some kooky shades and electricity.  Just electricity in your palm.  Tesla.  A Tesla coil or something.  It's like Tesla.  Wow. 
[01:40:30]  Look at that.  While we have Danny in here and we mock his ridiculous hair, the nephew thing.  What's this story about there, Danny?  I found this on a break this morning.  Apparently, some young 20-something guy was trying to teach his aunt a lesson about locking  her door because I guess she never does.  And he wanted to show her how unsafe this was.  So he hides in a closet with like a Jason mask and a Freddy glove, waits for her to come  home, calls her to get her attention away, and then proceeds to scare the bejesus out. 
[01:41:00]  That song keeps coming to my head while I look at you.  She blinded me with science.  She says, I can't stop singing that song when I look at your face.  And you know what?  I used to have the same do in high school, but it was longer, and I used to dye it wacky  colors back then.  Nice.  So I used to have the same thing, like yellow, blue, red, all sorts of weird things.  They should do like a little patriotic thing for 4th of July this year.  You should have fireworks coming out of it.  We should just have everyone shave their head.  Shave their head.  I was thinking about doing cornrows.  Cornrows?  Cornrows.  So you don't really want to give up on this? 
[01:41:30]  That'll look great.  No, I'm not.  You're ready to give up on this, right?  No.  I'll go as long as Sam goes.  Sam is in for the long haul.  Sam was really bummed and started begging.  Right before we took a vacation, which is easily a month, almost a month and a half ago,  he's like, come on.  You know, when we get back from vacation, I'm like, yeah, all right, no problem.  But now he's in.  He's grown in another month.  This whole Afro war has turned into another Vietnam.  It's like a boondoggle.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  It's not ending.  Sam, you can actually put like pens in.  Yeah.  It has like other uses.  It's pretty calm today.  Like Sam could kind of tease that out.  Yeah, Danny's has that, I combed it with a M80 look.  Yeah.  Yeah, Danny looks like he just got scared.  Wow.  Sam?  Well, my hair is actually an Afro.  Danny's is just awful.  It really is, Danny.  Yeah, I know.  It's amazing.  Well, he's got a little baldness up front. 
[01:42:30]  A lot of it.  Well, all right.  I was going to say a little.  No one was going to acknowledge it.  You don't have to be nice, but.  Yeah, really.  I like, I actually like that look better.  Geez, can you take the headphones off?  Honestly, God.  Can I just say something?  It looks like he's always upside down.  No, that look, you look like the poison spitting dinosaur in Jurassic Park.  You're going to kill Newman.  The guys in the back don't like it when I take my hair out and I put my headphones on.  This I'm just doing so you guys can see how puffy is in the front, but usually I'll.  It's pretty impressive. 
[01:43:00]  I'll use the head, the headphone band to push my hair back.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's always like this.  It looks like you're running real fast.  It looks like 1955 Doc Brown.  That's exactly what I guess it is.  It's Doc Brown.  Turn sideways.  Let me see your head.  You do.  You do.  You look like that flower company logo.  That would have been.  Oh, FTD, the little Mercury man. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  Mercury.  It would have been funny if I thought of FTD or whatever.  Yeah, so now what?  It's all planned out.  Now what?  What happens with the Zafra Wars?  I have no idea.  Yeah, we've got to figure out an ending to this dumb bitch.  I say we introduce colors.  Colors?  Introduce colors?  Oh, wow.  Like the wacky 70s guy at the football game?  How about you pick colors out of the hat.  You've got to dye your hair that color.  Look.  And the person that wears that color the longest wins Zafra Wars.  It should turn into, I don't know if you guys ever saw the pictures, but every year there's like a mustache championship. 
[01:44:00]  Sure.  I think it needs to go in that direction where now we have the raw materials and now we need  to produce something out of them.  This is going to turn into, let's do colors.  So we dye our hair blue and then in two months you say, why is your hair blue?  Right.  And then we decide.  And then we make like little.  Now blue would be an easy color.  Sculptures you're thinking?  Some kind of like Afro sculptures.  Like those ghetto prom pictures with that girl with the helicopter hair.  I want to send them to the hood. 
[01:44:30]  We should send them to the hood and have somebody make some stuff.  Like a barba, like a black barba make something out of like Sam's hair.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  Like we can make the twin towers or something.  Let's have ghetto prom day.  What website is that on?  Those pictures are really funny.  I think if you just Google like ghetto prom pictures, a bunch of websites.  Amazing.  Some of the pictures, some of the things they do with their do.  Yeah.  All right.  Do something with their head.  Look at Sam.  That just wants to be sculpted.  Yeah.  Oh, it doesn't.  Oh, it does.  Like shrubbery.  You know what it is? 
[01:45:00]  It's like a raw marble that just wants to be chipped away.  All right.  All right.  We'll figure something out.  The nephew's scaring the ant, right?  Yeah.  Here's the audio.  That's him calling her on the phone.  Hello?  Hello?  I want to see!  Hey!  Let's see! 
[01:45:30]  Stop!  Stop, don't come home.  It's a mask!  You almost scared me to death, Douglas.  What are you doing?  I'm going to tell your mother on you.  It's a mask, you see, Jason, the movie.  I am never going to see my next birthday.  How would you like me to do this to you?  You're never going to let me see my next birthday.  Oh, your mother's going to know about this. 
[01:46:00]  Those cute little babies grow up to be just nightmares in your life.  Eric's pulling up the video now for you guys,  but you've got to see when she runs outside to the back porch  and tries to throw her leg over the little balcony thing to get away.  It's so sad.  It's so sad.  Because if it was an actual intruder,  if there was a real guy with a knife,  she would have been just cut to pieces.  So dead.  Yeah, just completely stabbed to death.  She had no survival instincts.  Look, she's got one leg over the top. 
[01:46:30]  She's ready to jump.  Oh, how funny would that be?  What a dolt.  How funny would that be?  All right, very good, Danny.  That's funny.  He says it's just a mask.  Yeah, but it's on a guy coming into my house.  Yeah.  How are you supposed to know?  It's just a mask.  You idiot.  It's an intruder with a knife, you dummy.  The camcorder probably gave it away, too.  I mean, if a guy's coming at you with a knife,  like a fake, a phony knife and a camcorder,  I'm going to be tipped off.  Hey, very good, Danny. 
[01:47:00]  Tomorrow, tickets are going on sale for our Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Tickets on sale tomorrow.  Tickets.  I got to tell you something.  Dope.  This is a little weird.  We're going to have a great time.  It's going to be a great show.  I got to tell you what happened, though.  We wanted to take a year off just to kind of rest the whole comedy festival thing.  We had two very successful years, played in a lot of places.  How many shows did we do all together? 
[01:47:30]  Maybe ten or so?  Something like that.  Yeah, a lot.  More than that.  In two years, we did about ten or twelve of these across the country.  And we decided, you know what, we should take a year off  and just kind of regroup, and that's that.  Well, the PNC Arts Center in Jersey, we've done so well for them.  They said, no way, man.  No, you guys can't take a day off.  They pulled us back in.  We want you guys badly, which is very flattering.  So we're psyched, and we're all in,  and we're going to do another show this summer.  I think we're doing Jersey, and now that we've got Jersey booked, 
[01:48:00]  I think we might do Buffalo,  and I think we're trying for Boston to keep it at three.  Keep it to a light summer, we're hoping.  But the big news today, join Opie and Anthony  and all our favorite comedians at the PNC Bank Arts Center  on August 2nd for an evening full of all the comedians and antics  you know and love from the radio show.  Absolutely.  Most of the guys you know that do the radio show with us will be there.  I'm sure Bobby will be there again, and Patrice, and, of course, Norton.  And then I think we're going to try to work in some new guys 
[01:48:30]  like maybe Jim Jeffries and Nick DiPaolo.  We're still working on the lineup.  The lineup is good right now, but we're still tweaking it.  So we should have a lineup for everybody in the very, very near future.  We're going to have DiPaolo.  Yeah, we want DiPaolo this year big time.  He's our big get.  Tickets are on sale tomorrow at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.com.  So I just want to get the word out there for everybody  because I know people are going to want to get the good seats.  All right?  The PNC, you know how much money they lose in beer sales?  Oh, my God.  That's what it is. 
[01:49:00]  They're just like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  We've got to sell beer.  Yeah, they don't care about what's going on on the stage.  They're like, we've never seen this much beer being sold in our lives.  Well, they show up at 10 in the morning with a football game.  Oh, it's great.  The tailgating.  I mean, we'll get into it as we get closer.  But the big news, tickets will go on sale tomorrow through Ticketmaster.com  for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  All right?  Right.  All right.  You know what?  We can do this as we go on a break.  We're paying attention to the top songs in the nation, 
[01:49:30]  and we're doing a little something with that on our show.  And we got today's.  Lovely Steve from down the hall.  The other Steve.  The older Steve.  Yeah.  Helped us out with this.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony's top song of the day.  Sarah Bareilles.  Love song.  I'm not going to write you a love song.  Of course you asked for it.  Of course you need one.  You see.  I'm going to write you a love song. 
[01:50:00]  Of course you tell me it.  Make a break in this.  You're on your way.  I'm going to write you this day.  If all you have is leaving,  going to need a better reason.  To write you a love song today.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony heading toward the weekend. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, Bob Kelly doing a great job filling in for Jim Norton today.  I see you're going to be at Giggles Comedy Club in Seattle, Washington, May 16th and 17th.  Tickets available at gigglescomedyclub.com.  If I make it back from Guatemala, I'm going to be in Giggles.  Yeah, you know what?  We should talk about that.  You saw the movie Apocalypto or Apocalypse.  How do you say that dumb name?  That's it.  You got it.  Apocalypto.  Apocalypto.  Really?  You got something right?  Yeah.  And because of that, you decide you need to go see the Mayan ruins. 
[01:51:00]  Well, there's a friend of mine who's probably the whitest guy you'll ever, ever meet.  He came back one time from a trip.  What?  Sorry.  I haven't been on in like three weeks.  Bobby's cursing all over the place.  All right.  So you got the whitest friend and what happened?  Sorry.  It's okay.  I'll turn down the music.  Now I'm nervous.  We'll take you seriously.  Let's go.  I'm nervous about cursing.  Um, and he, uh, he came back, he handed me this little statue. 
[01:51:30]  It was like 200, 2000 years old before Christ.  And I told you, I asked him where he got it.  And I just, I was like, dude, next, he's like, I was in Guatemala.  I went down there, go down there like three or four times a year to, to, to get relics.  To, he goes to these little, these little places, these Mayan ruins and buys this stuff  for like 20 bucks.  And, uh, I was like, I'm going to go next time.  And he was like, all right.  All right.  First of all.  Yeah.  How did, how does he know it's like older than Christ? 
[01:52:00]  Well, the Mayans are actually.  No, I understand all that, but can't it just be a local going?  We got some relics for you.  I probably did.  You dumb Americans.  Oh yeah.  I probably did a check for made in China on the back of it.  Exactly.  Of course.  It beat it up a little bit.  It looks old.  It's actually Mickey Mouse.  No buttons.  Oh no, you, you've been rickrolled. 
[01:52:30]  Come on Bobby.  So you brought back a whistle or something?  He brought you back a whistle.  I heard.  Well, he didn't know it was a whistle.  You just go to these little villages and they just tell you what it is.  No, no, no.  You buy the stuff.  I swear to God, dude, he gave me this little relic.  He's like, this is probably around 2000 years old before Christ.  And then I turned it over.  There was a little hole in its foot.  Its foot thing.  Foot thing on his foot.  Hit his foot thing on his foot. 
[01:53:00]  And I blew into it.  I mean, it's not like, you know, you could use it as a rape whistle, but I mean, you know,  if you wanted, you know, you wanted to attract some old ladies, maybe you could use it.  Your friend is gullible.  Yeah, that sounds like, this sounds like a, some kind of fence, man.  Dude, listen, well, I got a flight ham.  They will sell anything when you get out of this country.  Dude, you don't.  And how are you, how are you supposed to know if it's real or not?  Dude, you don't understand, man.  The Guatemala and Honduras and South America, dude, they, they still have people, you know, 
[01:53:30]  raising pigs to eat.  I mean, these, these people aren't, you know, they don't have electricity, man.  I actually, I didn't think it was dangerous.  I thought you just go down there, you go to these ruins.  I mean, the pyramids down there, you know, they had pyramids, uh, 2000 years ago.  I mean, watch Apocalypto.  These are a lot of people's heads off and Anthony would have loved it.  You could have just caught people and then shot them.  I don't think they had guns.  As game.  No, but you could have thrown a rock and had a club.  Lopped heads off and roll them down the pyramids.  Yeah, exactly.  So they do.  And they just like a lot people, just throw them off the sides of the pyramids. 
[01:54:00]  Yep.  They used to take them up to the top down the stairs.  They would take their heart out and then they would lop the head off and then throw  it down the stairs.  But the fun part was there was, there was a guy down the bottom with a net and he would  catch it.  Catch it really?  Yeah.  He'd catch it.  So it didn't go into the crowd?  Yeah.  Like a hockey game?  Yeah.  You don't want the puck going into the crowd.  You don't want any lawsuits from the beheading that everyone's watching.  And, uh, yeah, I mean, but it's, if you, I Googled, that's why I love Google. 
[01:54:30]  It's unbelievable.  I Googled, uh, how dangerous is Guatemala and it comes up.  You don't even know.  And you're going there when you don't even know.  I'm going Saturday morning, flying in tomorrow, tomorrow morning, flying in.  You're flying tomorrow to Guatemala tomorrow.  Yep.  We should have had a going away party cause you're not coming back.  Dude.  Yeah.  You're so dead.  Why are you going to Guatemala?  You're going to end up in a pot and a big iron pot with a fire under it.  No, I'm not going to be on the side of the road like a deer in Connecticut. 
[01:55:00]  It's just a fat deer with his butt ripped off.  What's wrong with the Caribbean?  It's close.  It's an easy flight.  It's warm down there.  The water's really blue.  As I said yesterday, I was having a midlife crisis and Patrice corrected me.  He says, you're having a life crisis.  Not mid.  It's just from beginning to end.  One big crisis.  Yeah.  I'm just, dude, I mean, you know.  So you're flying to Guatemala.  Right off the bat, we got to go to Spiro on Long Island.  He's saying, be careful in Guatemala.  Spiro.  Yeah, and it goes along with most of those countries down there. 
[01:55:30]  You just got to be careful not to get shot in the face for your cell phone.  Just for your cell phone?  Oh, yeah.  I've worked with a bunch of those guys that come from there.  And a lot of stories.  You know, life, there's no value to life.  They'll just shoot you right on the spot for something like that.  Bobby's going, yeah, and nodding.  Yeah, this is what I've heard.  But, you know, I'm going tomorrow.  Let me ask you a question.  Are you going with the military?  So should I not wear my Breitling around the street?  No.  Yeah, I would leave that at home. 
[01:56:00]  Just walk around like this?  Yeah.  Just cash out of your pocket.  Well, this is the deal.  American money sticking out of your pockets.  This is what you have to do.  And this is actually on the, I found a website.  And actually, the Department of Defense has all kinds of stuff and tips and stuff like that.  I actually have to get two wallets.  My real one, all my credit cards, a money belt that all my stuff goes in, that goes around my belt.  Then a fake wallet to put, you have to put like five bucks in, in ones, in your back pocket.  Because you will, that's just for them to have. 
[01:56:30]  Okay?  Why would you do it?  You got to pay them off.  I have to have a fake watch.  You know what I mean?  A plastic.  I bought a Casio last night, a fake watch.  Can't wear my wedding ring.  Can't wear my real Breitling.  Is that what you're telling your wife?  Oh, honey.  Ah, yeah.  It's very dangerous.  What can I tell you?  They're telling me I can't wear this.  I'd be in danger, so.  You know.  I'm really going to be in Long Island.  Gotta listen to the government.  Very dangerous.  See you in a week or two.  You could get in touch with me at the Guatemala Club Med. 
[01:57:00]  Making up all the, this guy.  Why is this a Long Island number?  Ah, well.  I don't know.  This guy is buying a fake wallet, a fake watch, just so he can leave his wedding ring at home.  I had to buy all plain clothes.  You can't wear any, I bought khakis.  I've never worn khakis.  Khakis, like you're out on an adventure, like you're an adventurer.  Yeah.  I had khakis.  A pith helmet?  Did you get a pith helmet? 
[01:57:30]  What's a pith helmet?  That's one of those oldie time, you know, those guys that would go into Africa, the khaki-colored pith helmet.  You know what a pith helmet is?  You gotta wear them.  You wear it when you're like hunting buffalo.  No, I don't.  Big game.  You gotta go your pith in it.  All right, stop it.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy's not here.  Swim walk.  Whoa.  I bought a poncho.  I have a poncho.  Okay.  What are some of the other things they're warning you about in Guatemala? 
[01:58:00]  Well, you know what happens is that if you go to the internet, there's a whole website of what to do.  Like, there's certain highways you can't take.  You have to be careful leaving the airport because what most of the times they do is they put a roadblock up right outside the airport and just take your car.  As you're coming out and they rent the car, they'll just take your car.  So just take your car?  Yeah.  I mean, there's videos on YouTube.  They'll stop buses.  They're like, don't take public transportation because if you're American, they know.  They know when you're American, so they're watching you the whole time. 
[01:58:30]  You can't take photos with kids because they had an organ scam down there where they thought all Americans were harvesting little kids for their organs.  So if you take a photo of any of these little kids or look at them weird, the parents, the people get really weirded out.  And they, it sometimes forms a mob and they'll just, they'll just lynch you.  They'll take you and lynch you.  Sounds like a great place to visit.  There's a pith helmet up on the screen.  And you're going there to... 
[01:59:00]  At the top of a pith.  And you're going there to climb up really old stairs.  I'm going, I'm actually going to three, I'm going to two villages.  Uh, and then we're going to stop in Guatemala.  You don't want to go to villages.  Yeah, villages is, you know.  Well, the guy I'm going with actually said to me, he goes, look, when I used to live there, he goes, uh, when I was a kid, we'd have two days off a year where Navy SEALs would come in and train us.  How to get through roadblocks, how to, uh, deal with, you know, uh, kidnappings and how to use a gun and all that. 
[01:59:30]  I mean, Anthony, this was right up your alley.  Sounds it.  I'm there.  Uh, well, uh, Keith, the cop is here.  He's anxious to say something.  I just printed this off the Guatemalan embassy.  Okay.  And what they do is they publish a crime and public safety report.  And, uh, just some of the quick ones.  Two men armed at machetes, stolen Americans backpacking money while I was climbing on the volcano.  Uh, an American tourist was murdered just outside of the central market. 
[02:00:00]  Uh, along six foreign tourists.  Most, including four Americans were assaulted by four men with guns and ski masks.  Huh?  Along with a local driver and two guys.  They were all shot.  Uh, an American was held up at gunpoint at a traffic intersection shortly after arriving at Guatemala City Airport.  Money, a U.S. passport.  Welcome to Guatemala.  This is all recent stuff?  Uh, yeah, this was all, well, June of 2000, yeah, June 2007. 
[02:00:30]  It was the last date on it.  The person who wrote it was probably shot.  But, yeah, pretty much withdrew money.  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.  He's just looking down the list, Bob.  What are you doing, dead, dead, dead?  How bad do you want to look at, like, you know, some old civilizations?  Dude, I didn't, I, look at, when they said Guatemala, I thought it'd be more like Puerto Rico.  I didn't know it was going to be, you know.  Guatemala?  Just no.  Are you going there for a quick weekend?  I'm going Saturday.  Uh-huh. 
[02:01:00]  We go to Guatemala City, uh, Saturday afternoon from the airport.  We go to a little site, uh, archae, archae, how do you say that?  Archaeological?  Thank you.  Uh, site from, uh, the airport.  And then we go to a city, some, some little city.  Oh, I'm sure it's a huge city, just like Manhattan.  Uh, and then we spend the night.  Great, more nooks and crannies for them to drag you into and slit your throat.  Right.  That's pretty much, I would want to be in an open field so you can at least see them coming. 
[02:01:30]  I'm trying to grow my beard so I look like a Guatemalan.  What?  That's, I want to, I actually want to, I just want to go to like a Salvation Army and get  like old sweaters, like a Xanadu sweater because you know that's like in down there?  Yeah, that's like, right.  You know they, they get the, yeah, by the time it trickles down there.  Yeah.  I want to get some chick jeans.  Yeah, that's great.  So you, so you could look like a pedophile as you're in Guatemala.  No, like, you know all the clothes down there, you know, they all have like stuff that  we wore like 15, 20 years ago. 
[02:02:00]  Sure, yeah.  But they, it's like hip now, like at the, the original Patriots logo hat, just wear that  down there.  Unbelievable.  Let's say hi to Dave, the trucker.  Dave, what are you hauling?  What am I, I'm hauling nothing right now.  I'm going to get a load of hazardous waste.  Oh, wonderful.  Hazardous waste.  What lucky town gets that later today?  Jimmy's blood sample.  Not viral hazard.  Just, all right, I gotcha.  What do you got for Bob?  Well, I want to ask Bob if he's going to get inoculated. 
[02:02:30]  Is he going to get his shots or is he going to, you know, go down there and get yellow  fever?  No, I, you know, I didn't do that either.  I figure it's going to be a quick in and out.  So it's either, you know, I hope I don't get bit by a scorpion or a snake and I'll get  that malaria.  Yeah.  You're going to end up with malaria.  You'll be under a mosquito net over the bed, just babbling to yourself.  Well, nice knowing you, Bobby.  Yeah.  Is that what malaria does?  Like, that's what I picked here.  What?  If you have malaria, you have to get in bed and have a net over the bed. 
[02:03:00]  And sweat a lot.  And you got to sweat a lot and just babble.  Yeah.  How would you be out of that?  It sounds like the show.  You don't have malaria.  Yeah.  They just showed it right there.  They just showed the lady going up the pyramids that I'm going to.  Oh, that's great, Bobby.  Oh, and I'm going to Iraq at the end of the month.  Yeah.  Why not?  Pick all the garden spots.  Sure.  You ever hear of Disney World?  It's a lot safer.  That Pleasure Island is terrific.  You wouldn't want to go.  What'd you say?  That Pleasure Island is terrific.  You'd go.  I know.  You're crazy. 
[02:03:30]  I'll tell you, my dream place, and I almost did it when we were off the air, and I just  couldn't figure it out, is Machu Picchu.  What's that?  I want to go to Machu Picchu.  Machu Picchu.  Where is that?  That's the civilization in the clouds, basically.  You got to climb for like-  Cloud City from Star Wars?  You got to-  Pretty much.  Pretty much, Anthony.  Yes.  Get Machu Picchu up there.  Show Bobby.  You have to hike.  Some people do it the lazy way, and I guess they now have a train that goes to the top  of the mountain, but if you do it the right way, I think you hike for close to a week, 
[02:04:00]  maybe five days, something like that, and you're camping along the way, and you're partying,  and then you finally get up to Machu Picchu.  And is there a tribe up there?  No, what is it?  I guess it's-  And you just go down?  Huh?  And you just climb back down?  Yeah, you walk around, it's an old city.  I think it's another, what?  Is it a Mayan city, too?  I don't know.  What kind?  You don't have any pictures of Machu Picchu?  Everyone knows the spot.  They use it in TV commercials.  Do they?  Yeah.  For what?  This thing.  That's it?  What is that?  This thing, Bobby.  This is what you really should be doing. 
[02:04:30]  What the hell is that?  Looks like where Richard Drives went to see the UFOs.  You've never heard of Machu Picchu?  Devil's Tower.  You've never heard of this place?  That's pretty cool.  It looks like Lord of the Rings.  Who used to live there?  It's a city on the top of this mountain.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Mayans?  I'm going there.  Mayans?  Dude, it's the same thing.  I can be raped and mugged in the way too Machu Picchu.  That's the same thing.  The only thing that can get you is wild animals as you're hiking up this mountain.  That's all.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Look at that, though.  Why wouldn't you want to go there?  The city in the clouds.  What's there?  I don't see a Starbucks.  I don't see anything.  No convenience.  There's no hotel.  You walk in and out of these rooms and stuff and check things out.  But they're empty.  Yeah, I know.  There's no people.  Anyone lives there.  So when you get there, what do you do?  It's more about the, uh, it's not about-  Get a bumper sticker.  I went to Machu Picchu and you slap it on your car.  Look, man.  It's not about the destination.  It's about the-  The journey.  The journey.  Yeah, man. 
[02:05:30]  We're going to smoke some weed, man.  Dude, let me tell you, we dropped some acid at Machu Picchu.  It's like the greatest thing ever, dude.  And I get, you know, now that I'm, uh, very, very involved, um, I guess I can't do the trip  anymore because I did a lot of reading on this.  Uh-oh.  And it's very, uh-  What, do they tie the blondes up to a-  No, no, no.  With vines so Kong could come and get her?  You can't take her anywhere down there.  No, when we were off the air, I was going to go solo and, and they talk about how the 
[02:06:00]  day before you get to Machu Picchu because you, you hike for, I don't know, I, I forgot  how many days, but three, four, five days, but the last night-  They have a bunch of women that come down and-  The last night of camp is legendary for being an all-out party orgy.  Really?  With just, yeah.  But with who?  Like the other, like, granola crunch and hairy-  Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.  Sure.  Those, and then the next-  Those women that carry, like, coffee down on their backs with a little, they wear a little,  like, derbies.  Yeah, the hairy shins. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Hairy shins.  A lot of Machu Picchu fans checking in.  It's the Incas.  Thank you to everybody.  Oh, the Incas.  Too many people to give credit.  And also, it's in Peru.  Thank you.  It's in Peru.  Peru.  Yeah.  And I checked into the flight and everything.  I mean, it was, it was going to be a big deal.  How much is it?  Like, what, a hundred bucks to get there?  Around, around trip.  Yeah, something like that.  No, it is.  You fly with goats and stuff.  Yeah.  This whole trip.  On the frigging alive plane.  Yeah.  That's it.  You crash in the Andes and eat each other. 
[02:07:00]  You wouldn't.  God, they'd still be alive if Bobby was on that plane.  You wouldn't do Machu Picchu?  He'd be sitting there, still lost, just going, boy, this guy lasts forever.  That's pretty good.  Sorry, Bobby.  It was good.  I mean, I lost a little bit.  You're losing weight, though, which sucks.  Yeah.  Why is it sucking, you jackass?  Because your whole gimmick is that you're the fat guy that we make fun of.  Why do I have a gimmick?  You're wrecking it.  I'm wrecking it.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  Ruining our fun by getting healthy.  I don't like that you have the ultimate fat guy on the show, and you never make fun of  him.  He's black and fat, but he slides right by you. 
[02:07:30]  Ooh.  Goddamn scared ass.  He carries it well, and he-  He doesn't carry-  You can't carry that fat well.  Dude, I'll tell you the difference.  Okay?  Just because he puts on a hat.  It's not that we're obsessed with fat people.  People that are fat their entire lives, they're just, you know, that's them.  You, the first time I met you, compared to now, I don't even-  It's two different people.  That's where the jokes come from.  I guess you have a point.  I did transform.  Dude, is it safe to-  I did transform from a hot guy into an aunt.  Bobby, you were thinner than me.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  When I met you.  Yeah.  Easily.  Yeah, yeah.  You were like maybe 160.  Yeah.  165 pounds.  Well, you get-  This is the thing, too, is that I forgot.  I always-  I was-  Because you guys are like, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  You never want to hear what happened.  I don't know.  Well, I got two knee surgeries in two years.  Oh, so you couldn't exercise.  Well, I had no ACL for a whole year.  And then another year, I actually was covering from the knee surgery.  Now that my knee's better, I can actually work out.  What's your excuse before the knee surgeries?  No, that was it.  I wasn't fat before the knee surgery, you jackass. 
[02:08:30]  I'm sorry.  Jackass.  Joke, Bobby.  I'm really sorry.  Machu Picchu, yeah.  Oh, you were saying Guatemala.  How much is the round trip?  Dude, it's 300 bucks.  The whole trip's going to cost me, like-  You hear this, Ant?  Yeah.  Literally $500.  Three-  $500.  American.  See-  For American, yeah.  See, yeah.  Because no one is, like, running to their travel agents to go to Guatemala.  That's why-  If it costs more, you'd never-  The tickets are so cheap.  Yeah, you'd never book-  No one would ever book a flight there.  You have to have crisp-  Crisp $1 bills, though, to buy stuff because they- 
[02:09:00]  Hey, I gotta jump in because we're running out of time.  Lonely Planet website.  Travel warning.  This is for Guatemala.  What?  Safety issues for foreigners' travel in Guatemala is generally safe, but a relatively high level  of violent crime is committed against foreigners.  Vehicle jackings are almost an everyday occurrence, especially in Guatemala City, where you said  you were going.  First day.  Intercity travel after sunset should be avoided.  Travelers should exercise extra caution on the roads in rural areas, particularly in 
[02:09:30]  the northern and western regions.  And you did say you're going to some of these villages.  When taking photographs in rural areas, be aware that some locals believe foreigners  come to kidnap children.  Severity, high-level alert.  I thought it was going to be stealing their souls like they're just so primitive.  You don't take my picture.  You've stolen my soul.  Now we have to disembowel you.  Well, there was one jackass that took a little kid, a villager, and just took a little photo  with him, like put his arm around him, and they, a mob formed, thought they were trying 
[02:10:00]  to steal him for his liver, and they just, they hung him.  They think that Americans are going down there to kidnap the kids for organs.  Yeah, they harvest their organs, yeah.  They did.  We were, though.  Why don't we?  That's a great idea.  Just go down and take those little rats.  Just go to Third World Nations.  Take them out of a-  Take their kids.  Take them out of a dirty puddle.  Yeah.  And that's it.  How about you give them like the best week of their lives?  Like you take them to Disney. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  And then they have fun.  Uh-huh.  And then you get their organs.  Because they'd be miserable.  That one week would probably be like a lifetime's worth of fun for them anyway.  And then you just, you know, hey, got a nice, young, vibrant liver.  I just know how much you guys would laugh if I came back here with a nice kidney scar.  You guys would be on the floor.  I came in.  They got you, didn't they?  I just got my fat kidney.  I'm all about adventure, but Guatemala, that's, you got to let us know how that went.  Next week you'll be back? 
[02:11:00]  I'll be back on, hopefully, yeah, hopefully on Monday I come back.  Hopefully.  All right, so it really is a long weekend.  Yeah, it's-  All right, so next week you got to call us and let us know how it went.  Yeah, if you can.  Or just come in.  You should come in and tell us that story.  Call us and tell us what the ransom is.  They kidnap Americans.  It's usually $1,000.  $1,000?  Yeah.  That's pretty cheap.  Not to them, but-  Oh.  Here we go.  We've run out of show.  It's go time.  Bobby, thank you so much for stopping by.  What's the big plug?  You got Just a Tip in stores now, your CD? 
[02:11:30]  It's on iTunes and Amazon and on stores right now.  Just a Tip.  We got a lot of things going on on iTunes as well.  Podcast section, the O&A animations are still doing very, very well.

Um, extreme camel toe.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God, you got a complete camel toe.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:13:30]  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone.  Oh, my God.  It's with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio for a Friday.  We got to hurry up and get this show done with because Anthony's got to start his supercar weekend, everyone. 
[02:14:00]  Supercar weekend.  You gave up way too much information for sitting here getting ready to start the show.  I always open myself up these days.  I go, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  I go, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  He goes, obviously, I'm going through a midlife crisis.  What do you mean, what am I doing?  I already know that.  We established that a while ago.  He said he's been going through it since he was 13.  Since I was 13.  When I turned 13, I didn't want to be 13.  I wanted to stay 12.  And I was like really upset with the fact that I was now in my teens. 
[02:14:30]  And I was going through a midlife crisis at 13.  Can I tell my story again really fast?  Which one?  I've only told this once, but it will be a second time.  Because Bob Kelly's in here and he might actually relate to this.  I remember being a kid.  You blow a guy for a steak in a closet?  No, that's you, you asshole.  And then we'll get back to Supercar Weekend.  But you just reminded me of something.  And I've only told this once.  My family, we're bath people.  We take baths. 
[02:15:00]  And I remember around 12, 13, I started getting like pubic hair.  But I was still into my baseball cards, my little league, my 10-speed bike, all that kid stuff.  So I didn't want to acknowledge that I might be fucking growing out of being a kid.  So I shaved that shit right off.  I was like trying to avoid.  Wow, because you want to avoid being a grown-up?  I didn't know what it meant.  I wasn't ready for it. 
[02:15:30]  So I was like, fuck this.  Get rid of this stuff.  Get rid of it.  I'm not ready for this.  I remember when my pubes started growing in, me and my friend used to show each other our cocks.  But I remember his little retarded brother had more pubes than all of us.  Right.  He came in with his cock.  Yeah.  And it was just huge.  And it had fucking just a bushel of pubes.  And I was so bummed out that this retard fucking had more pubes than me.  Yeah, but you had more, you know.  More brain cells?  Yes.  Than him. 
[02:16:00]  I remember the first time me and my friend, we were circle jerking.  And he was a little older than me, so he busted a nut.  And I remember I had to fake bust a nut.  How'd you do that at a circle jerk?  Because when you spit in your hand, if you keep jerking, it firms like a little cotton candy.  That old gag?  Yeah, yeah.  Like when you do it to your finger, you kind of spit on it and go like this, and it looks like your finger's coming.  It's a fun little joke, kids.  Play it at home. 
[02:16:30]  The first time I actually felt fucked up about pubes was when I got arrested.  I got arrested at 13, and they brought us into a room.  And they bring you in.  They make you shower right when you get there.  And I was with two 18-year-olds, guys.  And they just had fucking fancy cocks.  What is a fancy cock?  Just a fancy cock.  What are you talking about?  It hung nice.  It had a nice bushel of pubes around it.  And I just had this little 13-year-old pud with like no pubes.  Pud.  I just felt so inadequate. 
[02:17:00]  Robert.  Robert, for a straight guy, you've seen a lot of cock.  Yeah.  I know.  You've seen a lot of cock.  Oh, I should be a faggot.  You've got a lot of cock stories.  You like that, don't you, faggot?  I want to introduce Otto and George to the fine radio show here.  Hi.  Good morning.  Otto.  So Anthony is having a supercar weekend.  Yeah, you say drugs, guns.  Supercar weekend.  Yeah.  Probably no drugs.  Women, guns.  Do you do the drugs, Anne?  I don't even know.  No, no.  No, he doesn't do them.  He just runs them.  I don't do the drugs. 
[02:17:30]  I like beers, and I like Shiraz.  What?  I like wine.  It's a red wine from Australia.  Very good stuff.  Is that good?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really good.  That's what I drink.  I think it's better wine myself.  It probably is.  Like, I'm not a wine snob.  I know nothing about wine.  I like Shiraz, so that's all I drink.  What are you, a Vietnam hooker?  I can drink Shiraz, you faggot.  It's good stuff.  Believe me, I drink my fair share of beer.  I like that.  I like beer, too.  He's a beer guy before wine guy. 
[02:18:00]  But you can't be drinking like that on Supercar Weekend.  Sure.  This is Supercar Weekend.  I have the Lamborghini on the way home.  And your life mate, what does he have?  He really is your fucking bitch.  He is not.  Do you guys give each other neck rubs?  The guy, Keith, is very quickly becoming like a personal assistant.  Yeah.  He knows how to conduct business. 
[02:18:30]  He's got a good rap on him, so he can talk.  Do you guys do a bonnet together?  He's not a lazy motherfucker like I am that gets nothing accomplished when I just sit around  on my ass playing video games.  At least your guy has a personality.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, GH, who are you talking about?  Hello, Bob.  You know, it could rain today.  If you get struck by lightning, you'll be dead.  CDs.  Little Jimmy has CDs.  DVDs.  Lucky Louie. 
[02:19:00]  Tickets available now.  Tickets.  Tickets available.  Shut up, you dolt.  Keith picks me up this morning.  Big Frankenstein.  And Keith picks me up this morning, and I had to thank him.  I'm like, dude, thank you.  I've been taking this route for a year now, and you're the first person not to hit every  fucking pothole up the street.  Oh, he's a good one for that, huh?  Keith, he understands.  But I explained it.  Kenny hits every pothole, and I finally figured it out, because he's such a creep and an OCD 
[02:19:30]  freak that he has to drive between the lines.  See, you might have to drive outside the lines to get around some potholes.  So, cuck-cuck, cuck-cuck, cuck-cuck.  And that road, is that filled with potholes or what?  That was horrific.  It's not a little pothole, by the way.  It's like, you're bottoming out.  And I'm like, Kenny, please, for the love of God, figure this out, please.  Cuck-cuck.  I lost the filling.  Oh, what a dummy.  So, anyway, Keith and you, Supercar Weekend.  Yeah, Supercar Weekend.  Where is that? 
[02:20:00]  Well, we kind of just go to the car club.  Like somewhere in Long Island?  It's a classic car club, it's called.  Classic car club.  Manhattan Classic Car Club.  Looks like somebody just got a free car.  Oh, plug.  There you go.  You got to get them somehow.  I didn't pay my membership fee.  I did.  Oh, classiccarclub.com.  Do you guys always have to get, like, a macho, like, Lamborghini?  Do you ever get, like, an Edsel?  No.  I'm just going to put around in an Edsel. 
[02:20:30]  Let him drive you around.  It's Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Porsches.  Right.  We're talking, like, sporty, high-end vehicles.  I like a nice Pinto with a bullseye in the gas tank and put your dental records in the glove compartment.  I'm with Otto.  Otto, you're not a car guy, are you?  No, but I live in Keyport, but I have a summer home.  I mean, Patterson.  It's going to be, like, fast cars.  Yeah.  And fast women. 
[02:21:00]  Maybe some chicks.  Oh, fast women.  Fast cars, chicks, guns.  Slow hips.  Going to go to the range.  Blast off some rounds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then maybe have a nice dinner.  Yeah.  Are you guys going to have movie night?  No, I'm not going to have movie night.  What are you going to do at night?  Are you just going to hang around?  GTA, maybe.  You're going to play some video games?  You're going to play a little GTA.  Order some pizza.  You know, you do need an Xbox upstairs in your room, so then we can network together.  What is this, fucking Silver Spoons?  We can network together. 
[02:21:30]  I have a PlayStation 2.  Are you adopted?  Hold on.  Yeah.  I want to bring this up, too, because during one of the breaks, Keith was actually bitching  in.  He goes, you know, I only have a PlayStation 2 in my room in your house.  And could you turn it off when you leave?  Let me ask you something.  I heard the thing whirring all night.  When Anthony says something funny, do you turn up and go, what you talking about, Ant?  Wait, how close is his room to yours?  No, as I was leaving and going down the stairs, I heard like a whoosh from the room.  Did you give him that maid's quarter? 
[02:22:00]  No, no.  He's on the complete other side of the house.  I'm on the second floor.  I'm not all the way in the back.  Should I come in and wash your dick for you, sir?  He's not in the Opie Dump bathroom room.  That room, I just put biohazard tape around the door and now it's shut.  It's shut like that fucking room in The Shining.  And you don't want to open it.  Anthony has so many bathrooms and he finally, like, you know, gives me the tour a year and  a half after he bought the house.  Thanks.  Happens.  I haven't seen your place yet.  Yeah, true. 
[02:22:30]  Keith runs a bubble bath for him where he wears a top hat.  Oh, you drink your Sherry's, faggot?  Sherry's.  Sherry's.  Whatever it is.  Sherry's.  Bobby, so I take the tour and I find this bathroom.  I'm like, he's checking all these bathrooms, so I left a big mess in that toilet.  And I'm sure a Mexican person that comes in and cleans, they probably had a problem with  it.  How many Mexicans?  Are you like monk?  Do you have like 17?  No, like six come in at one clip. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  And just go over the place like locusts.  I saw it in action.  It's amazing.  And that's it.  It's amazing.  They come in, they got the Buck Rodriguez vacuums on their back.  Why don't you get one of those electric vacuums, little robot vacuums they just turn on while  you're at work.  When you got Mexicans.  Get one and just paint a Mexican flag on it.  Joe R. from New Paltz.  Classic car club equals KKK.  Not at all.  No, him hating Jews equals KKK. 
[02:23:30]  He tried to hit black people on his way back to fucking Long Island means KKK.  Supercar weekend.  It's a nice weekend.  Nice weekend.  Driving.  Supercar weekend.  No, she's coming too.  Driving fast.  She's coming too.  Shooting guns.  Anthony, can I ask you again?  We're going to have some alone time where we're just racing the cars back and forth.  Yeah, you got to, you know, put them up against each other to race a little bit.  And then you got to pick up your wife to ruin supercar weekend. 
[02:24:00]  Anthony, be honest.  Be honest.  Six are no good when you want to have some fun.  Exactly.  Be honest.  Yes.  When he brings his wife, because he has to.  Not that he wants to, but he has to.  Yeah.  Does it, do you kind of go like, fuck, because you can't be, you can't be you, you.  She's actually really cool.  No.  So she, so you get to be, you guys still get to be guys when she's around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen her listen to, I've seen her listen to something.  Hold on.  No, he's going to, he's going to draw on me.  Whoa.  Fucking, what are you crazy?  I've seen her take, take some heat. 
[02:24:30]  What do you mean?  From Keith.  Like, you know, so in all in fun, but you know, she can, she can hang.  What do you mean heat?  Come on.  Just some language.  Yeah.  You know, she's, she's from a civil service family.  Her, her, her brother and her father were firemen.  So, I mean, it's, you know, same stuff.  She's used to the language.  Do you have kids?  Yeah.  So where are they when you guys are doing fucking race?  Supercar weekend.  When you guys are doing speed racer weekend.  In the trunk.  In the trunk.  Put them in the trunk.  Chain them out.  Are you guys really racing each other?  Yeah.  And we'll have to, you know. 
[02:25:00]  These are two great cars to race.  This is like the creme de la creme of the car club.  It's the Lamborghini.  It's the Ferrari.  Gallardo, yeah.  And against the Ferrari F1 430.  Yeah.  What about the new Porsche?  Do they have the new Porsche?  They have the GT3, yeah.  What about that?  What's that F1?  F1 what?  The F1 car.  It's like, it's an F1.  That's all I know.  It's F1.  But it's like one of the fastest cars out there.  It's called the F1.  The Ferrari F1 430 is, is a very fast production car.  That one, I've done 150 in it. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  You don't get scared doing 150.  I do 98 and the car starts shaking and I get nervous.  You're so, you know what it is?  You're so focused on driving.  You know when you drive and you're just driving, you kind of, you mess with the radio, you  kind of look around a little bit.  If there's something going on on the side of the road, you might take a look or a girl  or something like that.  When you're doing like 150, you are fucking focused on driving and nothing else.  You are so like in the moment.  You're looking out the windshield and just looking at the street.  And then what happens? 
[02:26:00]  And then you try to avoid it and roll 800 times as they pry your body out of the records.  James Bond just flipping.  That's the point.  That's the point I'm making.  You're done.  Yeah.  You're certainly focused, but there's no way you're going to avoid anything.  Fate.  It's all laid out there, my friend.  If you run over a cigarette butt at 150, you can flip the fucking thing.  I just got upgraded to first class.  To Guatemala.  Thank God.  They upgraded you to first class for your death. 
[02:26:30]  That's very nice of that.  That's good.  That is really nice.  There's only one way.  Thank God.  I didn't want to fucking sit with the chickens in the back.  You don't have to fly with the chickens.  Yeah.  Those little flat-faced people.  Fucking going home.  Going home to see my...  Shut up.  Yeah.  Fucking boogie-nosed assholes.  That's the F1.  Wow.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's not what we're taking, though.  That's the F1.  That's supposed to be a fucking fat...  It's got wings like a tampon.  It sounds like a...  It sounds like a...  When you turn it on, it has the same sound as a jet engine.  Really?  Yeah.  It goes... 
[02:27:00]  That's pretty cool.  I don't know how to do a jet engine, but...  That definitely looks cool.  That's a good imitation of something.  All right.  A ghost.  I do an imitation.  It actually goes like this.  You know what's going on in Kansas?  My imitation of a Jewish farmer.  Look!  A Tvista!  Sorry.  Cricket.  Cricket.  Cricket.  Cricket.  I don't know.  When you drive a car like that, though, I just think douche.  What?  You think douche?  Really?  You think douche?  Yeah.  Why? 
[02:27:30]  Like the guy's just a douche.  What do you mean?  Why?  I don't know.  I'm not saying like...  Like you guys are like...  Doucheous?  No, you're trying it out.  Not...  I'm talking about the one they showed.  Not the ones you guys are driving.  Like that.  Look at that.  No, that looks cool.  I'm talking about the one we had on the screen.  It's just over the top.  With the gullwing doors.  It's showing off.  It's obstentatious.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  Like you're completely a douche.  You're just showing off.  That's the one I'll be taking...  Something like that's cool.  I can see that.  What's the point of having great wealth if you can't rub people's faces and make them 
[02:28:00]  feel like crap?  I think the best thing I've ever saw down the West Village, a guy pulled up with one  of those Lambos, and you can't...  I mean, literally, the street stops when you see that car.  What do you think of the guy, though, inside?  Well, actually, he pulled over, got out.  Arab dude, of course.  Fucking gas money in his fucking fat family's pocket.  And all of a sudden...  Just rings his beard out into the gas tank.  It just started overheating.  And his steam just started shooting out of the engine.  Everyone loved it, right? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, we were all fucking dying.  He had to have it towed.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  It broke down?  Great.  Yeah, I just kind of got yelled at by Zach for saying that I did 150 in the car.  Oh, yeah.  Condoning.  No, that's just...  Well, nah.  It might have been kilometers per hour.  That's just for radio purposes.  Yeah.  You know, Anthony's not really going crazy.  No.  If you were going to do 150, though, in a car, what road would you do this on?  Like, where could you do this?  Probably wouldn't want to say.  No, not like... 
[02:29:00]  You don't have to say where...  Straight would be good.  Pick a straight, long road.  Without side streets coming onto it.  There's a few of them on Long Island.  They have some roads like that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm getting turned on to a good website right now.  Oh, yeah?  Chuck in Kansas.  Oh, God.  Chuck in Kansas.  Bring it on, brother.  What's up today?  What do you got today, buddy?  It's Vista. 
[02:29:30]  You guys should go to WreckedExotics.com.  WreckedExotics.com.  Oh, boy.  I wonder what's there.  Hopefully not our point.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that had to hurt.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Oh, we're going to have fun with this side.  There seems to be a lot of...  That McLaren is...  Oh, God.  Oh, that's painful.  Oh, somebody didn't make it out of that record.  You can see Anthony's little hat on the curb. 
[02:30:00]  Shut up.  You're going to Guatemala, you fucking dead man.  Oh, God.  Dead man walking here.  We got a dead man walking.  I can't wait to replay this on Monday, and it's true.  Yeah, we have a very sad announcement to make about Robert Kelly.  I hope we both die.  I'm not making that up.  Fuck you.  I hope we both die.  I die in Guatemala, and you die in a fucking high-speed chase with your ass, buddy.  With your ass, buddy.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  You got to go to an NHRA national event and see some really fast cars. 
[02:30:30]  I've been to English Town, my friend.  I have seen Top Fuel dragsters and funny cars, and yeah, it's amazing.  That, that, that, bam, bam, bam, bam sound, and your fucking ears can't even take it.  I used to love that.  When I was a kid, my stepdad used to take me, Billy Manchington, and he made me sit there.  I had a headache all the time because of that.  That's didn't make you, though.  Oh, I told you about the steak. 
[02:31:00]  Listen.  But I remember I was so sick, I wanted to go, and he wouldn't let me go because he wanted  to see the truck, the jet truck, the jet truck, and then I puked on the lady's head  in front of me.  Good for you.  And wrecked his day.  Yeah, he was mad.  He beat the shit out of me.  He was mad.  Oh, that's wonderful.  You little fucking cocksucker.  You still talk to this guy?  No, my mother divorced him.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah, let's find him.  I'm a douche.  Let's find him and beat him up and suck his cock.  How old were you?  It's Bobby.  How old were you? 
[02:31:30]  Teach him a lesson.  Yeah, how do you like he cocksucked now by a 37-year-old chunky bald guy?  Not so cute anymore, huh?  You liked it when I was cute.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I'm kidding.  I didn't blow him.  I was first grade to fifth grade, but he used to beat the shit out of me.  He'd punch you right in the face.  Oh, he'd throw me downstairs and shit.  A stepfather?  Oh, he used to beat the fuck out of me.  Did he have any kids of his own that were like brought along as baggage?  Never had kids, but his dad was like that fucking army dude, and he was a dick too. 
[02:32:00]  And he must have beat the shit out of him.  So, yeah, the last time he ever hit me, I actually chased him around the house with  a hatchet.  Good.  And he didn't think I was going to stab him, and he put his hand there.  He'd go ahead, little punk, and I thought I'd been hesitating.  I just brought the fucking hatchet down.  He moved his hand, and it was the first time I saw like a grown man scared.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Wielding a hatchet.  How old were you at that point?  I was in sixth grade.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's intense.  Lizzy boredom.  I thought it would get a little more. 
[02:32:30]  Lizzy boredom.  It was all right.  I liked it.  All right.  Does this guy know your Robert Kelly?  Nope.  I haven't seen him since.  The last time I saw him, he was on my mom trying to get one last pluck in before they  got divorced.  Oh, shit.  That's the last time you saw him?  For real?  He had money, though.  I remember he had the Monte Carlo with the T-tops.  He made me used to wash the spokes.  Remember spokes?  Get the chrome.  Get the chrome clean.  Oh, it's spokes. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  He had one of those hot cars, and back then it was a really cool car.  And then they were getting divorced, and he didn't want to get divorced, so he actually  bought Atari, but when it first came out, and he kind of, me and my sister are such  spineless assholes.  You know, all the beatings.  You accepted the Atari?  Oh, we were like, oh, she came home.  You're like, fuck the beatings.  This is an Atari.  We were all sitting around like fucking a family, me, my sister, and him.  Like, nothing ever happened for five years.  She came home, you little motherfuckers.  And then that night, I walked in on him, and he was on top of her trying to get one last 
[02:33:30]  pluck in.  And I saw his, he was a 6'4".  Dude, big guy, but he had a little tiny pud.  You saw his pud?  Yeah, I was trying to fucking stick it in my mom, and she was fighting him off.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  Did he ever shove a mustard jar in your eye and sell your rifle for a bulldog?  Nobody shook up a Coke and stuck it in my ass.  No, I'm joking.  Are you?  The president did that.  Man, that's sad, Bobby.  Jesus.  What are you going to do?  That's rough. 
[02:34:00]  I want to beat the guy up.  Huh?  I want to beat him up now.  I haven't seen him.  I saw him one time.  I was working at Grossman's Bargain Outlet, cutting rugs.  Really?  I remember I used to, like during the middle of the day, I'd roll myself up in the carpet  to take a nap.  People would come in and just unroll the carpet to look at it.  And I'd be in there like, hey, can I help you?  And he came in.  I don't understand why people like you, who had an asshole stepfather like that, or people  that were sexually abused, don't just beat the fuck out of the guy. 
[02:34:30]  You don't have to kill him or anything, but just knock on the door.  He was too young, man.  If you guys fucked me in the ass, I would fucking spend the rest of my life trying to find him  and do it again.  He never did anything sexual.  No, he never did anything sexual.  No, no, I'm not talking about that.  Just for being a douchebag, you should punch him in the face.  But like, if people are sexually assaulted, if you're some fucking little kid, and then  you grow up into being a man, you gotta go to the house, knock on the door, and just  punch him in the fucking face.  She's making him blow you.  Why?  Like in front of his family. 
[02:35:00]  Why is everyone blowing everyone?  Yeah, why, Bobby?  How humiliating can that be if he got over that phase of his life, and now he's got a wife  and kids.  He's going over there.  That would kind of be funny, though.  He's just like, but I have a wife and kids.  I'm sorry.  Pushing it in there, one of those fucking choke blow videos.  And then just drop you a seed in his little kid's lunch bag.  Why?  You have to bring the kids into it.  I was thinking down his mouth. 
[02:35:30]  I'm sorry.  Was there a fucking big difference?  I don't know how you brought me into this moment.  Down his mouth.  Swallow that faggot.  Hey, that's the movie.  Hold his nose.  I was trying to remember the name of the movie.  Matt's got it.  Matt on Long Island.  Go ahead.  Yeah, whenever Bobby talks about his childhood, it reminds me of that movie Radio Flyer.  Oh, yeah.  With what do they call him?  The King?  Yeah.  Radio Flyer is such a...  Afraid of the father?  That movie is so goddamn depressing.  Don't rent that one, Bobby.  What was that?  What was it called?  Oh, you'll cry.  Oh, boy.  Radio Flyer. 
[02:36:00]  The kid would get beat with an extension cord, and they hit it on the father, and then he  found it in the oven and beat him with it anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, I remember I came home.  I think I was in fifth grade.  He got...  Something like that happened.  I was going to Catholic school at the time.  They actually kicked me out of Catholic school because of him, because I would come in all  the time.  He punched me right in the face, and I just had a black eye, and I had to go to school.  What?  I just remember standing in a stoop at a drugstore crying, and then I went to school, and the  nun was like, what's wrong?  But that's when I learned, like, crying gets you nowhere. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  So I just would...  Nothing.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  I had a big black eye.  And then that's when I just was like, fuck it.  And then I went after him with a hatchet, and that pussy ran.  12-13, right?  12-13, yeah.  That's why he never beat him up.  He was too young.  Radio Flyer, one of the kids dies in the end, though.  Oh, really?  You ruined it.  I've been great if I die.  Like people running to go get Radio Flyer.  You know what movie you have to get?  Little Elijah Woods in that, isn't he? 
[02:37:00]  Not to switch the subject, you have to...  But the two brothers were going to run away with their Radio Flyer and get away from everything.  I wish I had a brother.  They had big wings on it.  I had a sister that hung out with fags.  That was my only option.  It's called a fag hag.  I remember she brought me over to this guy's house one day, and there was just mattresses  in a room.  And I was like, what the fuck is this?  I was 13, though.  He was like, what's it?  A prize.  Well, we have a party here.  And I was like, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  Party on the mattresses.  That's all I need is to fucking be raped by a fag, punched in the face by my stepdad. 
[02:37:30]  This is great.  What a life.  You really had some upbringing.  I was a fucking alcoholic.  It's a good prerequisite for being a comic, though.  Those horror stories like that, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Any comic with their parents still together in a happy life, I fucking don't trust.  Yeah.  They stole their jokes.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Well, because you need...  Look, to find everything funny in life, you need to have tragedy.  You need to fucking be able to, you know, see it from the other side. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Also, to seek the approval of complete strangers is not a normal calling.  If you have two loving parents that pick you up and give you approval every day, you  don't need it from some fucking stranger in a saloon, you know?  It's not normal.  That's so true.  Look at that.  He's getting very...  Oh, that's so fucking true.  He's got a nerve with Otto, too.  And it's not even...  It's not even just the crowd.  The whole crowd.  Even when I look out and I see one person, like, looking at a lot, having fun, I need  to go, what the fuck's wrong with you? 
[02:38:30]  What the fuck, wife?  What the fuck's wrong with you, Dad?  Yeah.  I mean...  God.  Well, Dan, you ought to be very successful in stand-up comedy, then.  Yeah.  Because you fit that mold perfectly with mother.  Mother.  Mother issues.  I at least have the raw ingredients.  Yes.  You certainly do.  Have you spoken with mother at all?  No.  Oh, we've been emailing, because Mother's Day is coming up.  Oh, and you acknowledge it?  Um...  No, I'm probably going to my chick's mom's house. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah?  You're gonna do that one?  Yeah, I keep trying to sub her in.  It doesn't work, though.  You know what, though?  I gotta jump in here.  I feel bad for Tham, because Travis blew up his mom bit.  I'm sorry.  Travis, yeah, came up with a real fucking great tragic mom story.  Tham basically hates his mother.  Yes.  You hate her?  Yeah, he will openly say he hates her.  Wow.  And we got some good stuff out of Tham, and then Travis one day casually tells us that  his mom walked out seven, eight years ago and said goodbye, and he hasn't seen her since. 
[02:39:30]  And she wasn't even like a mom that you knew was gonna fuck up someday.  She was the typical, just suburban mom.  Oh, really?  And then one day she ran off with a Jew rabbi or something.  What was he?  Jesus.  A Jew lawyer.  A Jew lawyer?  Yeah.  Ran off with a Jew divorce lawyer.  Oh.  Jesus isn't running with scissors.  Out of nowhere.  Running with scissors.  You were all adults at this point?  I was 20.  Yeah.  So my brother was 19.  You developed.  Your mom just walked out.  Oh, yeah.  I haven't seen her since. 
[02:40:00]  My father did that, actually.  Your real father?  My real dad wasn't in my life, came back in my life, and then just, that was, never called  me again.  Ten years ago.  Oh, that's gotta be.  Just gave me a pink slip.  Me and my sister wrote.  Pink sock?  He wrote, he wrote, he wrote my, he wrote my sister a letter like, look, you got, you  know, this is it.  You guys suck as kids.  Yeah, something like that.  I don't fucking want you.  But she needed a kidney transplant, because her kidneys failed.  Yeah.  So she's on dialysis four times a week.  And then he had to go in and get checked out. 
[02:40:30]  That's fucking lost.  You have to go through the whole list of people.  So he went in, found out he had hep C or some shit from Vietnam.  Oh my God.  And then he just said, fuck you guys.  And I haven't talked to him since.  And my, I like my dad.  My dad was cool.  Like he was, he kind of taught, you know, I mean, like we talk about sex.  He'd talk about fucking broads.  He was, he was like a pimp back in the day.  Yeah.  And yeah, he banged my mother when she was 15.  That's fucking smooth.  And he, you know, he fucked her in a bush in a park somewhere.  You know what I mean?  Hello, Hallmark. 
[02:41:00]  Why would he tell you that?  We used to talk, I remember a girl.  Why would a father tell the kid?  Because he's not really a father to Bobby.  They didn't have a father son relationship.  They were just pals.  I remember I was on the phone with him and this, uh, this girl called in and she wanted  me to piss on her.  She was really into me peeing on her for some reason.  And I told him, I was like, dude, this girl wants me to pee on her.  I'm like, would you, he's like, did you?  Are you gonna?  I'm like, would you, would you cool?  Are you cool with that?  Would you pee on somebody?  He's like, I wouldn't drink a gallon of water and muster up a piss. 
[02:41:30]  But if I had to take a piss, yeah, sure.  Right seat, wrong guy.  Yeah, exactly.  Honestly, that's, uh, that's fucked up though, that he would talk about sex with your mom.  Like, that's one thing you don't, as a child, you don't want to hear that.  You don't want to hear him having sex.  You don't want to look at him after sex.  You don't want to do anything.  Just fucking have the kids and then stop having sex.  We could always tell in our household, cause it was the two days a year they'd like kiss 
[02:42:00]  each other in the morning.  Oh, shit.  Somebody fucked last night.  Oh, God.  Parents kissing is worse than fucking.  What, a little peck or a big open mouth fucking?  A tongue, your mom's tongue going in your dad's tongue.  Your dad's just grabbing her box.  Just that sound.  Just fucking dry humping her in the kitchen.  The sound, right?  This is the sound that makes me want.  That coming out of your parents' mouth? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Ah, shit.  And then maybe a, ooh.  Let's say hi to, uh, Dana.  Dana.  Hello.  Hi, Dana.  What's up, Dana?  Hi.  Yes, you're on the air, Missy.  Okay, I couldn't hear you.  Um, yeah, I got a story for you talking about a mom doing stupid things.  Yeah.  Um, about eight or nine years ago when I was pregnant with my second child, um, my mom revealed 
[02:43:00]  to me just recently that she slept with my husband.  Wow.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's a whore.  Wow.  What?  Yeah.  What a betrayal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, talk about being, you talk about being a mess of a mess.  Betrayal.  Talk about being a mess of a mess of a mess.  That's the delivery of that line.  That's the end right there.  So now you're divorcing your husband and telling him.  Uh, yeah, well, it's a long story.  I need to, but I'm not yet.  Why do you need to?  Why don't you just fucking let it go down?  It's a fucking lifetime movie. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you let it go down?  Uh, we got three little girls and it's a difficult situation.  Is your mom hot?  Yeah.  Marky Post is going to play her in the lifetime movie.  You would hope she's hot.  That would make it all right, wouldn't it?  She's not hot.  She's a mom.  She's a selfish fool.  What did you do?  How did you confront the husband?  How did you find out?  Like, what happened?  Uh, well, she told me in the middle of a nervous breakdown what had happened. 
[02:44:00]  And, uh, when I confronted him with it, he just, he lost it.  He went apeshit and categorically, emphatically denied everything.  Yeah, you'd have to.  That means he did.  Yeah.  She, you know, of course, I think that was his...  Do you hate both of them now?  Huh?  Do you hate both of them now?  Yeah.  It's a little difficult to live either way.  Mom moved out.  She's living with my sister now.  And, uh, I'm still with him.  That would have been great if he made her suck his dick after he fucked the mom. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  I didn't mean to hear that thing.  That would have been great.  Or he does ass to mouth, but her ass to your mouth.  Oh, God.  You should take it out on the children.  What the hell's wrong with you?  The aristocrats.  Is that out?  Anthony, what do you mean, though?  Like, I don't understand.  How's it going?  See, like, uh, he is fucking the mother in the ass.  In the asshole.  Yeah.  And then he pulls it out and then goes home.  Right.  And then, uh, makes her suck his dick.  So she's actually getting shit from her mom's ass in her mouth. 
[02:45:00]  This tastes like mom's ass juice.  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah.  It's so gross.  She should definitely take it out on the children.  Breastfeed them with doorknobs.  Where did they have sex?  Apparently, it was at our house on Mother's Day weekend on our couch.  Oh, he fought.  So, Mother's Day weekend, huh?  Wow.  Well, he's just giving her a present.  What are you getting her out of?  An ongoing cycle of abuse and neglect and betrayal.  The gift of jizz.  Oh, the whole deal was because I was pregnant, the doctor had cut us off for a while. 
[02:45:30]  I was having some complications.  I got to ask, what are you going to get?  It's worse.  I got to ask, what are you going to get your mother this Mother's Day?  I mean, how are you going to beat giving your husband's...  Your husband's dick.  Your husband's dick.  It's not her Mother's Day present.  You can't top that one, unfortunately.  Flowers aren't going to feel the same.  Why don't you get her a cake that looks like your husband's cock?  No, he'll be lucky if you get the phone call.  This Mother's Day, get her a cock.  Your husband's.  Now, does your sister have a husband?  Yes, she does.  Do you think she's fucking him? 
[02:46:00]  I hope not, because I hope he has a whole lot more sense than mine did.  Well, it might have not been that...  Honey, you got to really relax a little bit.  I mean, she might have came on to him.  He might have been sleeping on the couch, like watching the TV, like golf or something,  fell asleep.  She just started sucking his cock, and then jumped on top and started fucking his cock.  Why did you say cock?  And then he woke up.  He woke up and, like, threw her off.  Yeah.  You know, and then ran into the room like, this is bullshit.  Why would you do that?  I was sleeping.  Yeah, that hard schlong you would become so familiar with was just fucking deep dick 
[02:46:30]  in your mother.  I was sleeping with one eye open.  Changing channels.  Yeah.  Well, the whole thing about it was, you know, of course, he denied it all.  Just, you know, up and down, backwards, denied it.  But I remember finding his underwear in the living room the next morning.  What'd you do, a DNA search?  How the fuck do you know?  What are you, a CSI?  Well, because underwear...  Just finding the underwear is incriminating enough.  Well, yeah.  I was big and pregnant.  But she knows how her mom smells.  Yeah, I was a little absent-minded anyway, but my mom pointed it out to me, and I was like, 
[02:47:00]  oh, yeah, I remember that.  Okay.  All right, enough.  I had the evidence in my hand.  Climbing on board.  Can you say denial?  Wow.  We don't get it.  Your mom likes cock.  Yeah.  She loves that cock.  Is your mom crazy?  Yeah.  Yeah, what gave her the nervous breakdown?  The size of your husband's cock.  She's been a size queen her whole life.  Finally got one. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, thank God.  Oh, snap.  I need it.  She's just like, oh, my God.  I just fucked my son-in-law.  Oh, my God.  She's lost her mind.  I know.  Wait as long enough to tell me.  Cuckoo.  So you don't talk to...  Are you getting her a present?  No.  No?  No.  Why not?  No.  Why not?  No.  Like I said, she'll be lucky if she gets a phone call.  Oh, you might call her.  You're putting your foot down.  Yeah.  I like this.  She's putting her foot down.  You can tell she's fucking...  That right there tells me that she's hurt.  She'll be lucky if she gets a phone call. 
[02:48:00]  She wants a relationship with the mother.  Watch out for this one.  You're too forgiving.  She's all about revenge.  She'll barely get an e-card out of me.  Yeah.  I'm going to reverse charges.  Yeah.  You shouldn't even give her a phone call.  This is Dr. Phil.  And you don't call her up.  I like how you have to say the name.  It's always a good impression when you have to say who you are.  No, because it was either that or Ross Perot.  Yeah, that's what I thought it was.  Thank you for saying, this is Dr. Phil.  No, I'm not as good as you. 
[02:48:30]  You should have turned around and then turned around.  She'll be lucky to get a phone call.  So let me ask you a question.  Rich Big.  Yeah.  So how long ago did this happen?  Why did Barmy's voice get like that?  My second daughter is eight years old.  So it had been about nine years ago when I was pregnant with her.  Nine years ago.  And now have you fucked your husband since then?  Well, what do you think?  Yeah, come on.  Yes, you have.  Say the cock.  Yeah, but I didn't know about it until last summer. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  So after you found out that he fucked your mom with his cock, have you sucked his cock  since then?  No.  Relations have been a little cool.  But you did because you didn't know you did have sex with him after he had sex with  your mom.  Yeah, because I didn't know it until last summer.  Wow.  Wow.  So you had her fucking innards on your innards.  That's so...  Yeah, right.  That's like almost incestuous.  I knew about it.  You do realize he's been fucking a lot of other women at this point.  Yeah.  Because if you're holding off the pussy, you know, he's going somewhere else. 
[02:49:30]  If you're fucking your wife's mom, you've been through some easier gets.  You know what I mean?  That you're at the bar or something.  That was the whole issue.  It takes some balls.  That ain't your first cheat.  Yeah, you've been getting a $20 head from meth heads for about six years.  Exactly.  He's been fucking doing the loop.  My first cheat.  Let me think.  Yeah.  Mom.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened to Travis, man?  It was all about Travis.  You blew up Travis's spot. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  This lady should be a hilarious stand-up, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, you really got stand-up in your future.  Who, me?  If you didn't have a coop.  I'm a teacher, so.  Oh, you're a teacher?  You have to fuck one of your students?  Yeah, you got to fuck and have your mother eat your asshole.  What's that?  This is just degenerated, hasn't it?  He just takes it right to the end of what we were going to do.  Great.  Stop dancing around.  All right. 
[02:50:30]  Do you have another seriously, though?  What age students do you teach?  Fifth grade.  Hot, right?  Oh, fifth grade.  Yeah.  Any hot students?  You one of those teachers that we're going to see on the news, maybe?  No.  No.  No.  She sounds like a nice lady.  You should dump this fuck and go on, move on with your life while you're still semi-attractive.  I sound pretty hot.  I think you get the word semi right.  Wait, you're pretty hot? 
[02:51:00]  Do you have a MySpace?  I do.  You do?  What is it?  All right, let's see your MySpace.  Wait, dump this fuck in your core mother.  You're going to get some friends today, Missy.  Let's see what your MySpace is about.  Yeah, let's see that MySpace.  Let's go.  We'll be honest with you, too, you know?  Yeah.  What's your MySpace?  What's my MySpace?  Dana Anel.  What?  What?  Dana Anel.  Oh.  Spell it.  D-A-N-A.  A-N-E-L-L.  Anal?  Anel.  You've heard anal all your life, right? 
[02:51:30]  They teased you in school.  And I don't care for it, thanks.  But they teased you in school about that?  What?  Hey, anal.  No.  I would have.  You've never had anal sex?  I'm cruel.  What?  You've never had anal sex.  I'm doing The Godfather by the way.  I'm trying to get her my son.  Hi, I'm The Godfather.  What's up?  You're spilling it.  Dana, how do you spell Dana?  D-A-N-A.  D-A-N-A, okay.  And the last name?  A-N-E-L-L. 
[02:52:00]  That's not my last name.  One word?  What are we doing here?  One word, all together.  All together.  Don't separate it.  By that space.  Just put MySpace.com and put it in Anal.  I have like a million hits from weirdos now.  An anal.  That's all right.  You seem to be a weirdo yourself.  Yeah, go fuck your mother.  Yeah, what other weirdos could your life is fucking full of two weirdos?  Yeah, right.  Invalid friend ID.  Your husband fucked your mom and you're still debating if you're going to call her for Mother's Day. 
[02:52:30]  I mean.  Yeah, that should be a no-brainer.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do you do little quippy jokes with your mom?  Like, hey, what are you doing today?  Fucking somebody's husband?  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Happy Mother's Day.  It's running in the back of my mind.  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  We've got to put you on hold to get your MySpace.  Why?  Just so we can get other search parameters that you might not want to give out on air.  Ah.  This is Iron Man.  Oh.  Yeah, she looks like Robert Downey Jr.  I love that.  A crackhead playing a superhero. 
[02:53:00]  It's like Courtney Love as Wonder Woman.  Swings into the room and pills and syringes go flying.  And I'm here to rescue you.  Doesn't Owen Wilson look like Ellen DeGeneres with a cock on his face?  Oh, shit.  His nose does look like a dick.  He's really got to fix that thing.  Yeah, I know.  Do another stupid movie with Ben Stiller cock-faced. 
[02:53:30]  There is.  That's her?  I don't know.  Let's see.  I took out one of the A's.  Oh, did you?  Is that her?  Where's she from?  All right, let's get her back off.  Yeah, show us those salty fish lips.  Go to the pics.  Go to the pics, yeah.  All right, let's look.  Very cute lady.  She's a teacher, yeah.  There's a thing.  Let's see.  We're all...  Yeah, let's see a picture.  We're still...  We're still in.  Wow.  Oh, that's you in your classroom.  Look at that skirt.  Yeah, what the hell... 
[02:54:00]  Wait, you're very nice.  You're kind of an iceberg, though.  Wow, she's pretty, man.  Yeah.  Oh, the one on the right?  Your husband's a fucking degenerate hillbilly.  Not a baby, you fucking...  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Supercar creep.  I like the one in the blue.  Wow, she's pretty.  Yeah, how old are you?  I'm 39...  38.  Wow, you're pretty, man.  Do you have to paint your eyebrows in?  No.  God, we would love to make fun of you, but you're all right, man.  You're pretty good.  It's all right.  I like the padded shoulder look.  I guess your mom's a little hotter, though? 
[02:54:30]  No.  Is your mom up on your MySpace?  She's one of my friends.  Oh, really?  Which one?  She's on my husband.  Let's go to her friends list.  Go to her friends list.  Let's look at her mom.  Which one is she?  The blonde one?  No, this one probably.  No.  Who's the old...  Does her name start with an A?  I was going to say battle axe.  Yeah.  You fucked her?  Wait a minute.  Your mom is still on your top five?  What is wrong with you?  He fucked that? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  I don't get it on MySpace at all.  Let me ask you a question.  Was your husband wearing red shoes?  Oh, God.  Why red shoes?  Wow.  Your husband fucked a ghost.  Your mother looks like the fucking wicked witch of the West.  Jeez.  What is going on?  Of course, you got to figure this was about, what, nine years ago?  It better have been fucking 30 years ago.  Your mother looks like John Adams.  Yeah.  She belongs on money.  She's got a face for money.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Creepy, rotted out tree behind the old lua.  That's our husband's cock.  Is that before she discovered electricity?  Yeah.  Old bifocals, Mom.  Why is she still in your top five?  She fucked your husband.  I just don't get on MySpace at all.  If we go to her page, is your husband on her top eight?  No, he doesn't get on the computer.  Yeah, right.  You should give her some herbal tea and then punch her in the stomach. 
[02:56:00]  I can't believe you.  You know what?  You're really hot.  Do you know that?  Yeah.  Did she have gray?  Because she's got a full head of gray hair.  Was her hair gray back when your husband fucked her?  No.  Oh, because I'm just imagining him just diving into gray pubes.  No, no, nothing.  Looks like a fucking Brillo pad.  Lovely.  Hey, I know a little bit about Bob Kelly.  He would, if he wasn't married, I think he would fuck you.  No, let me tell you something.  No, I'm not even kidding.  She looks like the wife in any Harrison Ford movie. 
[02:56:30]  No.  You know what I mean?  That type of...  You're pretty...  And let me ask you a question.  Are you with somebody now?  No, I took the day off.  I'm just kind of hanging out.  I'm not saying you're fucking somebody this second.  Not this minute.  Like, in your life.  Oh, in my life?  Yeah, you have any, like, you know, red wine on weekends?  You have that special someone?  No.  No, she still lives with her husband.  No, she doesn't.  Yes.  No, she doesn't.  Yes.  You still live with your husband?  She never dumped him.  Yes.  Bad self-esteem on this one. 
[02:57:00]  Holy mother of fuck.  What's wrong with you?  Don't you watch the talk shows?  Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up old painful things.  Fucking pride.  Get rid of him.  Holy, holy, my mother.  Fuck my husband.  He betrayed the marriage vows.  The fuck.  Yeah, what are you doing?  All right, I got something for you, Dana.  Put his cock in grandmother's twat.  First of all, you got to go to...  Fucking animal.  AshleyMadison.com.  It's a website dedicated to people who want to...  Cheating.  You're perfect for this website.  Yeah.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
[02:57:30]  Your husband and you are still together living in the same house.  Didn't you listen?  Because they got, like, three girls.  She's not even mad.  They're staying together for the kids.  Do you guys sleep in the same room or are you Dick Van Dyke in it?  No, we're...  As far as he's concerned, everything's fine.  Wait, so you're still sleeping in the same bed?  Yeah.  Yeah, and you have sex?  Well, yeah.  That's a betrayal of Shakespearean proportions and she didn't even fucking react to it.  Yeah.  It's a complicated situation.  My kids are... 
[02:58:00]  That's easy.  I can't do that to my kids.  I throw them out.  Let me ask you a question.  And then tell the kids the reason.  Are you at school right...  Are you in, like, a jungle gym smoking a cigarette right now?  How are you talking to us?  No.  Stay off.  Hey, Dana, why don't you go get your vibrator?  We got the perfect cure for this.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  No.  If you don't have a vibrator...  I'm not even at home.  Listen, if you don't have a vibrator, get the vacuum cleaner handle and just put that on  your clitoris.  You're not home?  Where's your husband?  Do you know where your husband is? 
[02:58:30]  Where's your husband?  Is that old folks home feeding pudding?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  It's lunchtime, ladies.  Dan's got something.  I'm going to have to go into MySpace now and delete it, aren't I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She is the nerdiest heroes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Tesla, Edison, and Einstein.  Well, her mom looks like Einstein.  Her mom fucked all of them.  Guys. 
[02:59:00]  Maybe your mom takes it in the ass, and that's why I went there.  I knew that.  I didn't want to think about it.  God, who would want to think about that?  Who's your friend there over there next to the...  Click on her.  It's private.  I already checked.  Ah, fucking bitch.  Who's the young girl?  Who's that?  Who's the blondie?  Uh, well, one's probably my sister, and one is, um...  Oh, she's...  You know, if that's your sister, he's fucked her, too, by the way.  I doubt that.  Absolutely.  Now, what's her name?  No, it's not... 
[02:59:30]  The sister starts with a J.  So she can tell us who it is.  That's her sister.  Look at the face.  The same smile.  Right there.  That's her sister.  Your sister's name starts with a J, right?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's okay.  Yeah, who's the one with the blonde, uh, kind of curly, long blonde hair?  Mandy or something?  That's probably a friend of mine, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you dyking with her?  Yeah.  You guys scissor in bed?  No, she's just a friend.  Pull the old scissor?  I love when dykes do that.  Yeah.  Grab each other's feet and just push it together.  I love that comment. 
[03:00:00]  Wishing someone had a cock.  I wouldn't know anything about that.  The whole realizing only mom does.  The whole time just yearning for a cock.  Just hoping enough of the skin pushes inward.  The scissor looks silly.  I love your mom.  Your mom left a comment on your mice bed and says, tell your husband I said hi.  Yeah, right.  Well, you got a very interesting little story there.  Sure do.  Why don't you cheat on him?  Naughty.  Yeah, you ever cheat on him? 
[03:00:30]  No.  Why?  No, because I don't do that.  Does he have a father?  Are you a Christian?  Yes.  Are you a good Christian?  Why don't you let his father fuck you?  How great would that be?  I love Anthony's Friday attitude.  That would be so cool.  And you videotape it and just send it to him.  And go, this is for nine years ago.  You thought you got away with something.  Yeah.  And just let his father do shit that you never let him do.  What you do is you let his father...  No, that would be just very difficult to do.  Here's what you do. 
[03:01:00]  You let his father come on your face and then you spell his...  I say I love you with cum bubbles.  Ew.  I blah blue.  Cum bubbles.  All right.  Let's let Dan go.  I think we've exhausted our supply of filthy, horribly inappropriate things we can say to you.  Hey, how were you turned on to this show, by the way?  I started listening a couple of years ago, I think, after we got satellite radio.  And I used to have a long commute to work and it just kind of kept me entertained. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, wow.  Right on, man.  Thanks.  Hey, hey, listen, sweetie.  I hope...  Nope.  I hope...  I just spit on the microphone.  I hope you can dump this asshole.  Yeah, get a little self-esteem.  Have some pride.  I'm working on it.  Yeah, why don't you drop the zero and get with the hero.  Wow.  It's the kid thing, man.  She's got three girls.  Thank you.  I'm working on it.  Fuck it.  She's got three girls.  The kids get along fine.  You're not doing them any favors.  Really?  Believe me.  You're not.  Not at all.  And I'll be the first one.  As soon as my mom...  Time out!  What? 
[03:02:00]  There goes kids get along fine after they split up.  And I went, really?  Yeah.  I'm a normal, productive member of society.  With 87 guns, cash around the house.  I'd have to rent fucking exotic cars to get his dick hard on weekends.  Yeah, you're normal.  Doing super car weekend, my friend.  My dick gets very hard.  I know.  I can see it from here.  Fucking huge mule.  All right, Dana.  We gotta let you be.  Thank you.  Hey, Dana. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  You wanna fuck Anthony?  Don't be any fucking.  I'll pass.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm not gonna have sex with her.  Why not?  She's way out of my demo.  My throat.  You got any cute students?  Fifth grade.  Yeah, they're all booger eaters still.  Okay.  I'll paint it green and shove it in their mouth.  Dana, I hope you...  I hope you... 
[03:03:00]  I hope you find somebody.  I hope you find somebody.  You should dump this asshole.  Find somebody else.  I'm working on it.  And get a little freaky with your life.  Stop being so uptight.  Get a little freaky.  Before you look like that gray-haired monster on your fucking MySpace.  Yeah.  You know, then it's too late.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  Fuck one of your kids' fucking husband.  You still got brown pubes.  Go for it.  Yeah.  Go for it.  Get a nice apple and stick it in your mouth and take it in the ass.  All right, Dana.  Thanks.  Have a good weekend. 
[03:03:30]  All right, thanks.  All right, we're gonna take a quick break.  We got Bob Kelly in the studio.  She was fun.  She was awesome.  I like a fun caller.  I love her fucking monotone personality.  Yeah.  Say whatever you want.  Beep.  Still with the guy.  Beep.  How much shit will a woman fucking take out there?  Holy shit.  Out there?  Whatever fucking shithole that she lives in?  A lot.  I guess so.  Otto, where are you playing?  Oh, I got my own show tomorrow night.  Right here.  Ooh.

And Conti over there, who never shuts the fuck up, so he's like a perfect.  It's like I have two people to fill in what you do, which is, you know, you're great at  pontificating and a great voice, man.  Thank you, sir.  So I have two guys that are gonna do both of those functions.  Two of my best friends in comedy over there.  Oh, that's fucking cool, man.  From 9 to midnight tomorrow night. 
[03:04:30]  Otto and George.  Doing the virus show.  Puppies and Sunshine?  Yes.  That's a great name for a show.  Puppies and Sunshine.  Yeah.  That's exactly what you can expect.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a lot of sarcasm.  Yeah.  July 5th, I'll be at the Showboat Casino at the House of Blues in Atlantic City.  Nice.  All right.  We're gonna continue in just a bit.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  This letter comes in from Kathy in Oklahoma.  She writes, Dear Casey, I like getting fucked in my anus and in my cunt. 
[03:05:00]  Could you play anal cunt for my boyfriend?  I also go ass to mouth.  Well, we'll get that right on for you.  Here's anal cunt on American Top Word.  Okay, Nancy.  All right, rock and roll.  We got Robert Kelly in studio.  Bob Kelly, just a tip.  Hello.  Could be his last show ever because he's going to Guatemala.  Guatemala.  For the weekend.  See?  Which is just insane.  For the weekend.  For the weekend. 
[03:05:30]  The fuck?  It's beyond me.  People around here go like upstate for the weekend or out to the Humptons.  You've got a casino or something.  Yeah, casino.  I'm going relic hunting like Indiana Jones to a third world country.  You think it's going to be like the fucking movies, like Indiana Jones.  No, it's going to be me fucking not speaking.  That's what he's going to do just to get out of the airport.  You know what I did in Brazil?  When we went to Brazil, I assimilated. 
[03:06:00]  We got pulled over by the Brazilian police, which is actually worse than getting pulled  over by gangsters.  Oh, I'm sure there's no corruption going on there.  None whatsoever.  I thought we could take care of it right here in Brainerd.  I want to be in compliance.  Well, what happens is if you get a girl from the club to go back to the hotel, you have  to put her into another cab because what they do, if they have these roadblocks, they look 
[03:06:30]  for guys with the hookers.  Okay?  And the only reason they're looking for that is because they want a little money.  They want money.  That's the only reason.  They're not trying to stop that down there.  Nope.  They don't care about that.  They know if you're with her, they can pull you over and they'll mess with you.  And sometimes the girls will have a little drugs and if they have anything, they'll  throw it on you or throw it in the cab and it's yours.  So me and Patrice just got in a huge fight because the cabs are small and they, you know,  it's me. 
[03:07:00]  I think I forget who somebody else.  He hucks this girl in the back.  Okay.  And then jams himself in.  And I'm like, dude, that's against the rules.  He's like, dude, just shut up.  Get in the cab.  She's like, she starts talking and do the bit, whatever the fuck Portuguese.  And we arguing, screaming back and forth at each other.  And that all ended once we saw the fucking cop roadblock and we were just like, fuck.  And they took us out, hands on their triggers, automatic rifles, and they're outside. 
[03:07:30]  And I'm just, I'm shitting my pants.  I'm like, I can see myself in fucking a Brazilian jail.  And I just stopped talking.  I looked down and the guy grabs me aside and he starts patting me down.  And every time he touched me, I just said, see, I went, see, he would touch my pockets  and say some, and I'd be like, see, I said, see, literally probably 60 times.  Heroin in your pocket.  See, I look at Patrice.  They got guns to our heads. 
[03:08:00]  Are you gay?  See, exactly.  He almost, they almost started laughing because he touched me.  Every time he touched me, he would open this bucket up, see.  I mean, what's this, see?  I mean, take off your hat, see.  What's your name, Cy?  See.  Cy.  You have a sister, see.  What's her name?  Sue.  Sue, see.  Are you guys done with your...  So did they shake you down?  Did you have to give them money?  Nah, they didn't take, they didn't do shit. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, what happened in the end?  They let you go on with the hooker?  I had a thousand, I had a thousand, what do they fucking call them?  Reals.  Worthlesses?  Not anymore.  Thanks to Bush, it's equal.  Go to Canada, you get 200 bucks, get your fucking 195 Canadian.  A Canadian quarter is a quarter.  Yeah, that really amazes me that ever would have happened.  I used to love hucking that shitty money out the window.  Big stupid money with a queen on it.  Really, the fucking die-cast metal they make it with. 
[03:09:00]  The same metal that you had a Tonka truck with.  Fucking shitty money.  So what happened?  It's a Hot Wheels quarter.  Yeah.  You had some of these dollars in your...  I had a thousand fucking real, which is basically rent for a year in that shitty country.  Yeah.  I could have got laid 97 times.  They took it all?  They took it out, and I think because they thought I was...  I don't know, man.  I just kept saying C.  He took it out, and he let me have it.  Didn't just let us go.  Wow.  What the fuck is wrong with them? 
[03:09:30]  My heart was pounding.  We got back in the car.  It was dead silent.  All of a sudden, you hear Patrice go, Bobby, motherfucker, if you said C one more time,  I was going to take a bolt in the head.  You motherfucker.  You said C 67 times in a row.  You were in a panic, though.  Come on.  I was panicking.  C, C, C, C.  Are the trips done with you guys?  Oh, it's all done.  Yeah, I'm married, dude.  They just didn't want to dig the holes to bury you, too.  Yeah, dude, those trips. 
[03:10:00]  Last time, we almost got killed, because Patrice goes down there, and he wants to be, fuck,  you know, the queen of England.  Fucking guys adopting babies like fucking Angelina.  I mean, you know, he's got 19 kids around him, because he's, you know, you give him a  dollar, and they're your friend for life, but these are the kids that kill you.  Yeah.  You know, so you show up, and they're, like, all over him.  The patriarchy, patriarchy, patriarchy, patriarchy.  Hey, and he's like, the mayor, here, take that kid.  Get him some soup.  Like, he's fucking Willy Wonka in the chocolate factory. 
[03:10:30]  Fucking, and you're not supposed to talk to the kids.  You're supposed to give them a little money, and then move the fuck on, because they're  watching you for the older kids.  Their job is to watch you when you come out of the hotel, when you go back, how much money  you pull out when you give them money.  Yeah.  You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then they set you up.  So, when they see that you go here every night, and then one night, they'll set you up.  But if they can't get you, because if you're just going back and forth, they'll have the  older kids come up.  Like Oliver Twist with foreskins. 
[03:11:00]  What's the lure of going to a place that dangerous?  I don't know.  Getting your fucking ass lit for 28 bucks.  Yeah.  By a fucking 11.  Jennifer Lopez sucking on her asshole for $11 while your friend jerks off on her cheek.  And then your other friend has a fucking glass dildo china set sticking it in her fucking  twat while she comes on a blanket.  So, the prostitutes are that attractive there?  Dude, let me tell you something.  They're fucking ridiculous. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  I mean, some of the hottest women I've ever seen.  Un-fucking-believable.  And then you just, you know, you write 200 on their palm.  You know, for what we spend at fucking Burger King and the Jersey Turnpike.  They're banging their top women because their men have no money because they fucking work  at Sugarfields.  Fucking savages. 
[03:12:00]  But yeah, and the men hate us too because their women don't like them.  So, you guys almost got killed?  Dude, we're coming back.  This was the last trip?  We're coming back from the club and all of a sudden one of these Brazilian motherfuckers  who are the scariest.  Because these guys all, they live in the favelas.  They all live in those fucking slums.  They're probably not happy that you guys are coming down and fucking their women.  They know what's going on.  No, not at all.  Not at all, dude.  Not at all happy or not at all what?  They're not happy at all, of course.  But these guys are like jiu-jitsu. 
[03:12:30]  I mean, these are badass motherfuckers.  Yeah.  All these guys are badass motherfuckers.  They'll kill you with their hands.  You know what I mean?  They'll put a nice fucking choke hold on you and a fucking arm log, whatever the fuck they  do.  Mission hold.  Flip around like a monkey.  There's no tapping out either.  Nah.  Hey, let me tap out.  Oh, no.  My arm.  Big John isn't going to come in and rescue you.  He rips your arm off and taps out for you.  You're just flipping your hand, watching it from five feet away.  We were walking back and this guy, all of a sudden, one of the little kids, you could 
[03:13:00]  see him, one of the little kids that Patrice was feeding.  Patrique.  Patrique, Patrique.  But he said, he must have said something.  You know, something happened.  I think he maybe got dismissed or something, but not intentionally.  And he went over and told one of the guys, because all the other guys are hanging out  on the cars.  Oh, shit.  And he comes up and he starts, you know when they say America?  It's like, you're Brazil, Americana.  And he's making like big Americana. 
[03:13:30]  And then leave Brazil.  And he's really pissed.  And me and Patrice was like, yo, what's up?  You know, Patrice isn't a pussy, but you know, but it's like, I was like, you know, let's  just walk.  We had one block to go to our hotel.  We just had to make it to a hotel.  It was the longest fucking walk of my life.  No shit.  We had these motherfuckers just yelling Portuguese, America, America, whatever the fuck they were 
[03:14:00]  saying.  Go fuck yourself.  No, no, no, dude.  Not on, no, not at all, dude.  Not at all.  They'll take you in the fucking slums.  You're done.  Sliced.  No, yeah.  The fucking cops are with them.  Everybody's with you.  You're dead.  You're fucking dead.  We made it up to the hotel door.  There's like four security, 24 hours a day, three outside, one inside, 24 hours a day  at the hotel.  So as soon as we walked up, they kind of walked around still yelling.  And I remember getting up to my hotel room and I'm like, is it really worth it? 
[03:14:30]  Is this fucking pussy worth it?  And then I went again.  So I was like, absolutely.  It's definitely worth it.  Well, now you're doing the same thing, but not even for pussy to find fucking relic coins.  Yeah.  I want to get a whistle.  And a whistle.  A foot whistle.  Bobby, you're self-destructive.  No, I'm married now.  What am I going to do?  I can't go get fucking herpes.  So now you're going to go get relics.  Relic.  What's the big get?  Yeah.  What do you?  I want to find a doubloom. 
[03:15:00]  A gold doubloom.  I want to find a Spanish doubloom.  Get a doubloom from when they assassinated that whole culture.  Just shake your head.  Let me, let's.  I hope he finds a doubloom.  Yeah.  Not a doubloon.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Bobby, have you seen that movie Taristas?  Yeah, that movie.  You need to show your old lady that before you go, man, and see if she still wants to  fucking go with you.  I'm not bringing her.  I'm not bringing my fucking wife to a fucking savage third world country. 
[03:15:30]  You go by yourself?  No, I'm going with a friend of mine who actually goes like three or four times a year.  Mules heroin?  Yeah.  I was killed last year on the virus tour, man.  I loved you.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we got tickets for the PNC show August 2nd going on sale tomorrow.  No, we weren't even going to do the tour this summer, Otto, but the jersey begged us, said  no.  Am I on?  I think so.  You haven't gotten the call yet?  Of course you should be on.  Let's say hi to Jim.  Jim, what's up? 
[03:16:00]  Ticketmaster.com for those tickets starting tomorrow at 9 a.m.  PNC's great.  We really want to take a summer off, and they're like, no, we.  You got to do at least one more somewhere.  Well, now we're going to try to get another.  Madison Square Garden.  No, we're going to try to do.  Hold on one second.  Buffalo and I think Boston we're working on.  Yeah.  What's up, Jim?  Yo, I'm right here.  I know.  What's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to.  I think your show is awful, and Howard Stern is much better than you, Clowns.  All right.  All right.  What else? 
[03:16:30]  Anything else?  Yeah, it's that you guys must be proud that you're finally on satellite radio because you  swear like every five seconds.  I mean, is that the moral of your show or what?  The moral of our show?  Yeah, I guess it is.  What?  First of all, try to use the right word.  You got a dictionary, Clown?  First of all, try to use the right word.  You can't be for real, man.  And then.  He punched out.  You can't be for real.  Does he understand also we do three hours where we have to be FCC compliant? 
[03:17:00]  Well, we're a little dirtier than usual today, but whatever.  What a cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd actually call him a dead cunt.  Yeah.  The fucking flapping.  Is that what you do?  Clown.  You're listening, asshole.  Kevin in Texas.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Bob, when you're down in Guatemala, you could pick up some Patriots winning the Super  Bowl shirts since they mailed them all down.  Oh, yeah.  I was trying to say.  That's what I said earlier.  That's where they shipped them all. 
[03:17:30]  Get the frigging Super Bowl champion Patriots.  You're going to be walking around looking for your relics and there's going to be fucking  19 and 0 shirts.  19 and 0 shirts all over the place.  19 and 0.  Ah, shit.  That would be cool.  Absolutely.  Have one of those.  You cunt.  That's funny.  Let's go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Bobby Caley is Incompetence Jones and the Temple of Dude.  The Temple of Dude.  Dude.  All right.  That was funny.  I don't like Incompetence Jones, but Incompetence Jones. 
[03:18:00]  I like the Temple of Dude.  Bill Kay, a regular.  He's like, why aren't you guys coming to Philly?  You guys pretty much sold out the last two years.  Well, yeah.  We sold out long before that.  We got a right with the Indiana Jones music.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  He got mad.  Because we weren't even going to do the tour at all this year.  Yeah, I know.  In Philly, we're not on a regular radio station, so it makes it a little tougher to sell the 
[03:18:30]  ticks.  I think it'll be cool.  I don't know.  We'll figure it all out.  It looks like we're going to be fucking doing an all-out tour again this summer.  You know that's what's going to happen.  No summer for us.  No.  You're not going to have...  Really?  Yeah.  Pretty much, you know, occupies your entire summer.  What is she doing?  Like Buffalo.  Buffalo never got another tour.  Oh, Buffalo's going to rule this year.  Why don't you do something down in Florida, man?  We should do Atlanta.  Yeah, down south somewhere.  Yeah, Atlanta.  Or North Carolina. 
[03:19:00]  Jesus.  Thank you.  You guys just burp into the mic.  Why don't we do Hawaii?  Yeah.  Fuck it all.  Let's just do Hawaii.  That's good.  We sell like 20 tickets, but who cares?  Shit.  Only 20 people could afford the whole trip.  Yeah, we'll get some flat-back Hawaiian women to show up with their ashy fingernails.  Yeah, that's good.  Actually, Pete wants to do the floating...  And there's no satellite signal there, I don't think.  Yeah, there is.  I don't think satellite radio, they get it over there.  They have a line.  I don't think so either.  Who cares?  It's just got a line. 
[03:19:30]  Pete wants to do the floating virus.  What's that?  On a cruise ship.  What's...  That's good.  I don't know.  That would suck.  Literally, where everyone gets the shits.  You all get a virus.  Fucking...  The traveling stomach virus.  Speaking of shit, we got a faux pas from, I think, a weatherman here.  It's just going to be kind of a mostly cloudy and cooler day before system number two takes  aim at us, and we'll see scattered showers and thunderstorms from that system unfolding  first thing on Thursday.  So for tonight, partly...  Did they start laughing at him in the background?  Well, they're laughing in the background. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, okay.  Our audience that's right there.  Yeah.  We're going to see some shit.  I think he said shitstorm.  Let's hear this again.  And it's just going to be kind of a mostly cloudy and cooler day before system number  two takes aim at us, and we'll see shit scattered and showers and thunderstorms from that system  unfolding first thing on Thursday.  We're going to see some serious shit.  Oh, shit scattered.  Right on.  Shit scattered.  Shit scattered.  That's good.  Oh, I'm going to definitely take an umbrella today.  We should bring Sam in here.  We got...  These guys are having too much fun. 
[03:20:30]  We got Chris Benoit calling his family and his kid for the last time.  Ah, that'd really pick...  Jesus.  That's a real picker-upper.  Jesus.  We're going from husband, mom fucking...  I'll be home to kill you soon.  We got about 12 people out there.  You guys want to hear this or what?  It's Morgan.  Yeah.  Sam, what do we got on the Chris Benoit phone calls?  Can you take that little cute yellow hoodie off?  That really looks like someone's little sister's hoodie. 
[03:21:00]  Like someone's little sister's clothes.  You want it like an ice cream cone.  Twink.  You want him to sit on your lap there, Bobby?  Huh?  You want him to sit on your lap?  Yeah, sure.  Come on.  No, why?  Just because it's sitting on my lap.  Come on.  I want to rub the back of your fro.  Yeah.  Get over here.  Otto, professional opinion.  Doesn't he look like a dummy?  Like a puppet?  Yeah, absolutely.  He definitely has that look.  With the moving eyebrows.  Yeah.  With the moving eyebrows.  Come here, Lane.  He's a dummy.  Yeah.  I like his little lion cub mouth. 
[03:21:30]  What?  Look at that.  Lion cub mouth.  Look at that.  Sam, what's wrong?  I've never been more uncomfortable.  This looks like a horrible video on YouTube that's making the rounds with that creepy fucking  guy and the little kid singing.  And he's fucking, he's accosting the poor little child as he's singing.  Did I just tell you, you know what really, what really uncomfortable, and it's not that-  That you're rubbing his back in his ass?  No, don't rub it.  Just, stay right there.  Stay right there.  Okay.  Just stay right there.  This is, this really, tell me if this feels uncomfortable.  Yes.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[03:22:00]  He's rubbing his bare back.  No, you just, you just, no, stop, stop.  Just wait a second.  What are you doing?  Just place your hand.  Don't move it.  Leave it right on the small of somebody's back.  But you're doing it, you're doing it under his shirt, on his bare skin.  Right there, right there.  How's that feel?  Awful.  Tell me when Bobby gets a rod.  He's going to get hard.  Stay right there.  I'm not on his leg.  I'm on his leg.  Feel his cock.  Tell me if it's hard.  Stop moving your asshole muscle in and out, because I can feel it on my head.  Sam, Sam, put your mouth on his dick and tell me if he's hard, because he'd be gay. 
[03:22:30]  Put your hand on my back.  Does that feel weird?  Yes.  Are you sure?  Yes.  Because you know why?  You can't leave it firm.  You've got to relax your hand.  Watch.  Wait.  He's so uncomfortable.  Stop, stop, stop.  Here we go.  Ready?  London Bridge is falling down.  Now he's bouncing him on his knee.  Look, I can feel one of your little testicles pushing it.  This is the worst experience of my life.  Look at you, little peach flies.  Who's shaving?  Who's shaving now?  I want to kiss more guys.  Who's shaving now?  Who's shaving now? 
[03:23:00]  Huh?  How's that feel?  Bad.  The small of your back is sweating.  Feels bad.  Does he have any hair down there?  No, he's got little hips, though, that are swinging in.  I can feel his little hustle.  Put your hand down the back of his pants and feel his ass crack.  What do I like right now?  No!  He actually has.  He's so uncomfortable right now.  His skin is like hot and cold.  It's like meat.  It's clammy.  It's like meat.  It's like rape victim skin is what it is.  Come on, baby doll.  All right.  Go sit back on you. 
[03:23:30]  You like that?  Baby doll.  You little hot ass.  I can feel it on my knee.  Fucking Bobby, man.  Bobby.  You're wrong with you.  You're right.  We forgot to talk about this.  All day we forgot to talk about this.  Is there a...  We've got to get the audio up.  It's broken today.  It's broken today?  Great.  There's a video clip.  It'll be up on opianthony.com.  We don't even know what this is because they're singing in a foreign language, aren't they?  It sounds German-ish.  It's German-ish.  Are they going to be Dutch?  It's the creepiest thing I've ever fucking seen. 
[03:24:00]  And explain this.  As far as pedophilia.  A little kid comes out singing.  It's in front of a live audience.  It looks like some crappy, cheesy, foreign TV show.  10 or 11 tops?  Maybe.  It looks like 9, 10, something like that.  All right.  So he's singing.  He walks out from the audience onto the stage where this big, fat, creepy guy is sitting  who places him immediately on his lap and starts touching him and kissing his cheek  and pulling at his clothes with his teeth. 
[03:24:30]  What a creep.  Look at this fat fucking creep.  Look how into it he is.  Dude, it is the creepiest video.  How many did you find this?  This is great.  We don't even know what it is.  Look at what he starts doing.  Fat sodomite.  He's got him right on his lap and he's cheek to cheek.  And then he just leans in and shuts his eyes and gives him this sensual kiss on the cheek  behind his ear. 
[03:25:00]  Here comes the best part.  Watch, watch, watch.  Did you just bite his ear?  Yeah.  Look, he's biting his clothes.  What?  What the fuck is this video?  And the kid is horrified.  He's now kissing the back of his neck.  He's so uncomfortable.  He's like biting his clothes.  This creepy fucking pedo.  And they stuck the smoke machine.  Yeah.  That's steam coming off his cock.  He just moved him to the front to hide his boner. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Now watch with the leg action.  Yeah.  Look at the legs.  Look at what he does with his legs.  He wraps his legs around the kid.  It's fucking bizarre.  And then his arms.  And he starts rocking back and forth.  You know he's just got an indented penis because he's fat.  And then his rod just popped out like a turkey timeout.  Look at the kid grabbing his cock.  The kid's horrified.  Now he's picking him up and cradling him.  Wow.  And rocking him.  Now he's putting the kid on his face.  He leaned back and is putting the kid on his face. 
[03:26:00]  Oh my god, dude.  This is fucking...  That's really weird.  This is evidence.  Now suck it.  Valuable evidence.  Now they're in a 69 position.  Oh my god.  Now he's holding the kid upside down by the legs as he's standing up.  And the kid's face is right by his cock.  What is this?  We don't know.  What is this?  We don't know.  The kid's still singing.  This has to be like some fucking...  Comedy thing?  No, it's...  It can't be comedy.  That's not funny. 
[03:26:30]  It is.  What I did with fucking Sam was funny.  I'm rubbing the small of his back.  I'm not hanging him upside down making him suck my cock.  Like...  Well, there's no cock sucking going on.  That would be...  Look at the...  And now he grabs him and cradles him again.  Oh my god.  It just goes on and on and on.  And the kissing.  He is a creep.  Anyway...  This has got to be like some boy lover shit.  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  It's got to be a boy lover convention.  How did the audience sit there?  Maybe like an Ambler convention or something?  How did the audience sit there and not have a guy just run out and clock that guy in the head? 
[03:27:00]  If it's all boy lovers, they're all fucking rubbing each other's cocks.  What country is that?  It's apparently Dutch is what we're getting.  It's got to be Dutch.  It's got to be Dutch.  Why?  Are they fucking pedos over there?  Yeah.  No.  Dutch people are just fucking all big fat head fucking sexual creeps.  They all have huge fat melons like that.  And they have no sexual...  They're just like, yeah, fucking suck it.  Fuck it.  Hey, we might have info on the video. 
[03:27:30]  Hold on.  All righty.  Let's go to South Dakota.  That was twisted.  Martin.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  How you doing?  I love you.  Love your show.  Hey, thank you, Martin.  So, what's going on there?  Yeah, not too bad, eh?  Hey, so what are you doing?  What are you calling about, Martin?  Oh, that little video you guys are watching?  Hey, I'm cooperating here.  Oh, the true quote.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm cooperating.  Yeah, that guy is gay, so...

We're not running a bank here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That fucking scum bag.  Love it.  Love that guy.  Yeah.  Give me my daughter.  Who the fuck are you? 
[03:28:30]  Give me my fucking money.  Yeah.  Martin, you have some info on the video?  Yeah.  That guy you guys are watching, that big fat guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He likes the sausage.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Well, other people are saying that he's a Dutch comedian.  He's a well-known Dutch comedian.  Thank you, Stephen S., and many others.  Always Confronting Social Boundaries and Taboos.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Slippy the Liberace, eh?  Yeah.  It's a Radisson, so it's pretty good. 
[03:29:00]  He apparently, the bit was...  I got nothing.  I'm funny.  All right.  Yeah.  Why let Dan explain the bit?  Because we understand he's gay, sir.  We got that a couple of times.  Yeah.  Apparently, he was trying to distract the kid.  Like, it was a little game they were doing.  Oh, a distraction?  Yeah.  That's what it's called, huh?  That's what it says in the wiki.  Maybe you could try to fool Chris Hansen with that one.  Yeah.  I was distracting the child.  Dan's going to have a distraction weekend.  A distraction.  Chris Hansen. 
[03:29:30]  Super cars and distractions.  Super cars.  Super cars.  Super cars.  I don't know how they like it.  It's just like a Hot Wheels car, only full size.  Get in.  Let me get the plug out, because these guys do help the Opie and Anthony show.  It's vidmax.com.  V-I-D-M-A-X.com.  Is it on the front page?  Uh, no.  Just, uh, type, uh, guy loves singing songs with little boys.  And then, and then if you can't find it, sort through the Michael Jackson videos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His whole catalog's up there, and then you'll find a Dutch comedian. 
[03:30:00]  Dutch comedian.  Uh, vidmax.  V-I-D-M-A-X.  These guys are very helpful with this radio show.  So thank you.  You get to call himself a comedian.  Under the guise of just being a pedophile.  Hey, isn't this hysterical?  I'm molesting a child.  Yeah, but Dutch people are fucked with comedy.  I mean, I've been over there a couple times, and, like, they'll have one guy out do sound effects, and it's genius.  Really?  They love it?  Like that stupid guy from fucking, uh, what's his name? 
[03:30:30]  Oh, Winslow.  Winslow.  Michael Winslow, yeah.  Not even sound effects that sound like anything, though.  So, he'll just go, New York City, go, beach, boop, ha, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  It's like, and they're like, they stand over.  He's saying something if you're Dutch.  He's a fucking moron.  Yeah, the Dutch should understand what he's doing.  So, this stuff like this guy would be fucking, they'd love him.  Wow.  Because they only have, like, two channels.  Yeah.  You know, one, I mean, and they have, like, they have good porn, too, out there.  Well, obviously. 
[03:31:00]  That's what we just watched.  You'd be in a hotel room, and a guy would be just fucking getting sucked off in a parking lot.  You know what I mean?  It's like, what the fuck is this?  That's good porn to Bobby.  Good porn to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Sucked off in a parking lot.  Location, location, location.  It's the surveillance camera from outside the hotel.  Let's talk to Sam before he goes to human resources.  Yeah.  So, Sam.  HR's going to get a call today.  Files his lawsuit.  Thank God Bobby doesn't get a paycheck from us, so we're safe.  Uh-huh.  You creep. 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  So, Sam, look how thin he is in that side.  Sam, are you doing a wrestling trivia thing with Ron and Fez later today?  Yeah, it's me versus Fez for the rematch.  And if you lose, Jess gets basically naked, your girl?  Not naked.  Your lovely girl?  The deal is, if I lose, which...  That Club Soda Kenny creeps out?  Oh, in a big way.  Yes.  Who's your girl?  She's very...  Where is she?  She's not here right now.  She's on her way.  And who's this girl?  I don't know.  I didn't bring her.  Oh, I didn't bring her.  Is she from Guatemala?  Is she from Guatemala?  And, uh... 
[03:32:00]  But yes, Club Soda Kenny freaks her out.  Yeah.  But, uh...  Listen to this, though.  If...  Jess is a number, man.  You know that.  If I lose...  We all know she's a number.  Well, all right.  If I lose...  Well, we could talk about it, because, uh...  You know, she's going to be doing something crazy if you lose this thing.  But I won't lose.  I went 10-1 last time.  Yeah, he's pretty good.  I think he's pretty confident if he's willing to put up as a girl.  What if they cheat?  If they cheat, I swear to God, there's any funny business.  I'll choke people out.  Funny business.  Choke people out.  Nice. 
[03:32:30]  Funny business.  Yeah.  No, but she will have to do a fashion show in a dominatrix outfit, a bathing suit, and  a nightie.  Ah.  But when Fez loses...  I thought the third one was, and with a white guy.  Oh.  Is this your girlfriend?  Sorry.  Yeah.  Is she black or white?  She's white.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, Sam's white, too.  Is she as hot as you?  What are you...  I'm kidding.  Look at you get all coy.  Because you drop your voice, you creep. 
[03:33:00]  So when she's sucking, you cock.  So when she's sucking, you cock.  But when Fez loses, he will have to do the fashion show in all of those outfits.  Uh-oh.  And they're all Jeff's size.  And either way, the audience wins.  Yeah.  That's a good win.  Hey, can we get Rachel Steele's cam up?  You know, we've talked about this girl for like a couple days now, and she's on cam as  we speak, and I want to see what it looks like. 
[03:33:30]  The Cleveland broad.  All right.  So that's good.  That's going on in Brana Fez today.  Yes.  All right.  Chris Benoit.  Hmm.  Yeah, I guess.  It's going to be a jolly little tape.  Did you know that...  Did you see the photos of Hulk Hogan rubbing oil on his daughter's ass?  On his daughter's ass.  That was disgusting.  Dude.  What the fuck is that about?  Yeah.  That didn't turn me on.  Like, stuff like that sometimes turns me on.  Like...  But that...  That didn't do anything for me.  That's what I said.  I think just because I remember...  I'm so glad you found your line, by the way. 
[03:34:00]  I just remember he's...  You know, I remember it was his Thunder Lips.  And it just doesn't...  Sure.  His big fucking fat hands on...  Oh, that was just weird, man.  It was in a weird spot.  And she wasn't even, like...  She didn't even, like...  She wasn't even looking back like,  Dad!  Like...  She was just comfortable.  Yeah.  Because she's had that done many times.  Wow, man.  What a fucking creepy thing.  How do you explain that?  You don't.  Can you, though?  I mean, can you...  Hey, look.  It's my daughter.  With these big, meaty fucking paws.  And rubbing oil on her...  Her ass. 
[03:34:30]  Right.  The daughter's ass.  What if your finger...  Give her the shocker?  Your finger actually slips under the fucking bikini.  It probably does.  Oh.  It probably, like...  Gives a little sniff and smells a little shitty smell.  What if your daughter, though?  Touch.  I'm filthy.  What if your daughter and you just feel his, like,  his fat muscle thumb go up your ass crack for a second?  You're like, oh, shit.  What was that?  Just lay there.  Just...  All right, Chris Benoit. 
[03:35:00]  Chris Benoit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I guess they just released some of the voicemails  that the family got, like, that he left.  Why would they release this to the public?  Some news story that I was watching,  like, this reporter was complaining about how it had taken months  for him to get this under the Freedom of Information Act.  Like, it was...  Like, he was in debt.  You know, somebody was in debt to him to give up these voicemails.  But there's one from Benoit.  It's like, before he did anything, he's just saying, I love you.  And the rest are from, like... 
[03:35:30]  These are the last messages, basically, though?  Yeah, I think that's...  That's the last...  All right, Chris calls his wife and kid.  Yeah.  Hi, honey.  Hi, Dan.  Dan.  Sorry, Mr. Alton.  So far.  I'll keep writing.  Mm.  Okay.  Wow.  Chilling.  But then...  Fucking heart-stopping.  Chilling.  And then Chris's son leaves a message.  This is really creepy.  Yeah.  I leaned on the machine with my elbow by accident, and it hit a button. 
[03:36:00]  Dude, there's a fucking line, dude.  Where's the old Anthony?  I don't even know what it hit. 
[03:36:30]  What was that?  I didn't hear it.  Listen to me, dude.  There's a fucking...  You talk about the chick and the fucking husband fucking the mom.  Put Sam on my lap.  Put the fag on.  Fucking with the little kid blowing the guy.  The fat Dutch head.  But that's too far, dude.  You can't make the fucking splat sound.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Okay.  Besides, you went over the audio.  Can we listen to this again?  We'll be back, then.  I'll be back soon, okay?  No, no, no. 
[03:37:00]  We'll just be there, okay?  Okay, so we'll...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We'll just be there.  Jesus.  Guys, this is fun.  I can't even...  Wait, this is stupid. 
[03:37:30]  It's not in good taste.  Problem?  Do you understand?  This is fucking not...  Like, it's a fucking little...  This is not fucking right.  Dude, look at me.  Do you know what karma is, motherfucker?  You're going to be doing 150 on a shitty Long Island road with Keith the Cop, and you're  fucking with karma like this?  Karmas?  What?  Karma.  Karma.  Karma.  Karma.  Yeah.  Fucking karma.  Yeah, he's going to be doing sentences.  An apostrophe or nothing for me.  What's wrong with you?  Sometimes I'm a bad boy. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, this is just fucking...  Dude, that's a little kid.  I know.  It really is tragic, and I have to do that to cover up for how bad I feel about listening  to it.  Yeah.  I have to make fun, because if I listen to it, I'll probably cry.  Yeah?  Fuck no.  You're going to be okay!  I fucking left my emotions somewhere way down the line years ago.  In Mexico?  Every emotion just gone.  You got nothing?  I'm like a fucking Terminator now.  I just don't. 
[03:38:30]  I can't be reasoned to or bargained with.  You melt and form into other people.  That's it.  And Chris's wife's friend leaves a message for her.  Oh, that's it.  Hi Nancy, it's Marnie in Canada.  Just phoning to see if everything's okay.  Her terrible report's on the radio, so just calling to confirm.  So we'll see if we can talk to you soon.  No.  Wait.  She's confirming the deaths?  Yes.  All right.  Wait.  A whole...  Whoa.  What?  There's a whole different thing going on now. 
[03:39:00]  So this chick just read in the paper.  What?  She reads in the paper that he may have killed his entire family.  So this dumb broad calls...  Hi, are you dead?  Calls her.  Yes, she calls her.  She's trying to confirm this.  Hi.  Listen, knowing...  Just trying to find out if you're dead.  She just read...  Do you know how fucking just fucked up on so many levels this is?  She just read the tragedy.  And you're creating a fucking army of detached assholes.  Look at these fucking assholes.  They're just detached from anything fucking civil.  Bobby gets so emotional. 
[03:39:30]  They're really on just a bench like a fucking dirty softball team waiting not to have any  feelings in life.  Fucking Christ.  You all right, Bobby?  You too far?  No.  This is just fucking ridiculous.  Well, it's ridiculous that this lady read or saw it, this tragedy, and then had to call  her friend to confirm if she's still alive. 
[03:40:00]  And that dumb Canadian voice, too.  Hello.  Listen again, really.  Hi, Nancy.  It's Marnie in Canada.  Just phoning to see if everything's okay, because we've heard terrible reports on the  radio, so just calling to confirm.  So hopefully we can talk to you soon.  Bye.  We're just calling to confirm that you're dead.  That you're dead.  She says, hey, hopefully we can talk to you soon.  Hi.  Your reservation for the rented car is Thursday.  We've got some terrible reports here of your death. 
[03:40:30]  You know what I hate about Canadians, too?  If you're dead, please call back.  Canadians always have to say Canada in every sentence.  Yeah.  It's just us from Canada.  No shit.  From Canada.  I can hear your shitty accent.  Fucking.  What if, what's all this death stuff about?  I hear you're all dead in your hoose.  Well, you know, it's wintertime.  We just got a moose.  We're going to send some moose pudding lip down.  Who the fuck does that?  She sounded too cut.  Was like, um, look, I'm very nervous and scared. 
[03:41:00]  We're going to get her.  Please pick up.  Please.  It's like, okay, well, if you're dead, then I won't talk to you, but if you're alive,  please call.  That's Vince McMahon.  He's crazy.  This bit is going a little too far.  Maybe that's it.  Yeah, they probably thought it was a bit.  Maybe they thought it was a fucking, you know, a work, as they say in the business.  A work.  Is that what they call it?  It is what they call it.  Yeah.  Is that what they call it?  Yeah.  I'm watching wrestling to try to find out if it's real or fake.  She had no worry in her voice. 
[03:41:30]  Bobby's got to tell.  What's that?  Speaking of wrestling, you got to tell.  What's the tell?  It's, you lower your voice when you want to fuck, like, Sam and other people.  When I was?  You want to fuck him?  When he's the one.  Yes, he does.  No, B.  Sam knows.  When you get horned up, you're all saying like, Sam.  Yeah, he goes from, first of all.  Yeah, to Sam.  Let me tell you something.  I don't, I had a big fight with my wife about this, too, because she got mad at me that  I don't get horned up anymore.  Nothing gets my dick hot. 
[03:42:00]  I told him, I was like, listen, you don't make my dick.  You don't make my dick hard.  You have to.  Oh, that's.  This is what I said.  Hear me out.  And I know a lot of guys are going to relate to this.  I'm going to go.  I said, my dick doesn't get hard for you.  You have to make it hard.  It doesn't pop up because you come out of the shower.  Oh, my God.  A naked woman.  Fuck that.  It's like an old dog.  You have to come over, rub its belly.  Holy shit.  Oh, you're talking about your dick.  Yeah.  Okay.  You can't just.  Because what happens. 
[03:42:30]  Seriously, honest to God.  Girls get mad that, you know, you're lying in bed and your dick just doesn't fuck.  Oh, my God.  I'm in bed with my wife and my dick isn't.  Oh, my God.  And she's like, I wanted to have sex last night.  Well, then why don't you touch my dick?  That's the only way we're going to fuck is if you grab my dick, suck it, lick it, flap  it, tease it, whatever.  Sammy's talking to you.  Get it hard.  Look at me, Sam.  Look at me.  See how the voice goes?  Yeah, yeah.  Sam, look at me.  Sam, I want you to do me a favor.  Zip that up and put it over your head.  No.  I'm not doing anything to fulfill these little fantasies.  Listen, I want you to get a basket and I want you to put that hood on and I want you 
[03:43:00]  to walk around the forest and sit there and walk around and I'm the big bad wolf.  Yo, little yellow riding hood.  That's what I want.  You never explained.  Remember when we did the Comedy Central pilot?  Yep.  Why'd you kiss me on the mouth?  Because look at that mouth.  You kissed him on the mouth?  You did kiss him on the mouth.  You got no upper lip.  Yeah, but why did you kiss him?  Why?  You look like a little baby lion cub.  You made Sam kiss homeless guys and then you kissed them. 
[03:43:30]  There was no reason for you to kiss me.  It had nothing to do with what we were doing.  You know what sucked about that?  I was kidding.  I was actually, when I did that, I was like fucking around, but you didn't pull away from  me.  You grabbed my skull.  But I didn't grab it with fucking like a clamp.  With two hands.  Well, I'm not a fucking, I didn't hold you there.  You did.  That's what you were doing with your hands.  Well, you didn't have to close your eyes and pick up your leg, faggot.  This isn't happy days.  Look, you're not going to turn this around and say I'm gay because you grabbed my head  and kissed me on the mouth.  Look, I've had a hard life.  Whatever I do isn't gay.  I want to kiss more guys. 
[03:44:00]  You have choices, son.  That's all I'm saying.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm trying to help you make choices in life.  You've had a hard life, Bobby?  Yeah, we've all had a hard life.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  We've all, everybody at this table is a fucking piece of shit that's been tossed around.  What are you going to do?  Refuse.  Oh, we are.  We're just a bunch of fucking.  Why did Otto take his mic screen off?  Oh, it smelled too much like that furniture.  Bad breath?  Febreze shit.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I was getting dizzy.  Yeah.  He's huffing.  What a mess. 
[03:44:30]  Stunk.  That fucking lady called to see if her friend was dead.  Holy shit.  That's amazing.  What a cunt.  Let's do line of the day.  Brought to you by AshleyMadison.com.  If you're looking for a little something.  You know what I'm saying, Bobby?  Yeah.  A little something on the side, right?  If you want to fucking suck your cock, what you do is you fucking take your cock, right?  And then you want to stretch your balls down, make your cock a little bigger. 
[03:45:00]  Do you have to do tricks to make your dick bigger?  Fuck yeah.  I got to fucking get my bush fat and pinch it away.  When you're chunky, you're fucking.  Bush fat?  Your bush fat just fucking surrounds your dick.  Oh, God.  Seriously, every 20 pounds, you get like an inch of bush fat.  You lose like a half an inch of dick or something like that.  Half an inch of dick?  I just got a formula figured out for it.  Oh, my dick is huge if I was just in shape.  Bush fat.  Your body is like fucking eating your dick like a big tree eats the road signs sometimes. 
[03:45:30]  It's ingrown dick.  Steven S. from Bayshore says auto fucking rules.  Yeah, he's funny.  Bayshore.  Absolutely.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  AshleyMadison.com.  Let's get into this.  The first runner-up line of the day.  If you have malaria, you have to get in bed and have a net over the bed.  And sweat a lot.  And you got to sweat a lot and just babble.  Yeah. 
[03:46:00]  Sounds like the show.  That was good.  All right.  A lot of mention there.  Right to the next one.  If you see an Indian crying, does that make you angry?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  That goes back a few years.  Throwing garbage at his feet.  Yeah, sure.  It's not even like they littered.  They threw it right at him.  Like that bag that came flying out of that old car with the fins on the back.  That had nothing to do with littering. 
[03:46:30]  No.  Absolutely.  Nothing more fun than tossing garbage at Indians, I guess, right?  Is that what we learned from that commercial?  Sure.  Dirty Indian.  Get out of my neighborhood.  That's good.  Otto, you got a phone call.  Ring-a-ling-ling.  Ring-a-ding-ding.  That's okay.  Ring-a-ding-ding.  We take all phone calls here.  Let's do another runner-up line of the day.  This tastes like mom's ass juice.  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah.  She should definitely take it out on the children. 
[03:47:00]  Breast-feed them with doorknobs.  That's a good one.  Otto will be doing his first radio show for 202, anyway, tomorrow night.  Yeah.  At 9 o'clock.  It's called Puppies and Sunshine.  Yeah.  Puppies and Sunshine.  Puppies and Sunshine.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  That's Patrice.  That's Patrice's show.  That's actually...  That's Patrice's show.  No eggs, no tits, whatsoever. 
[03:47:30]  Patrice's show, you get Popeye's chicken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And these guys are doing the show with you, behind you?  Yeah.  What are they going to add there, Otto?  You know, fucking bits, comedy, whatever.  Steal from you, basically, for three hours.  There's going to be a couple of guys hanging out.  Yeah.  Doing the hang.  Yeah.  Do you have, like, a purpose to this show, or are you just going to fuck around?  You know, I'm just figuring that, you know, we're like, you know, comedians are like the 
[03:48:00]  guys in Cuckoo's Nest who are at the card game.  Sure.  You know, we're retarded, you know, broken down people, but we can actually play a game  of cards, and then the audience is just the fucking drooling mongoloids that are chained  to the wall, that can't even raise their hand up.  So we're, like, a little better than them.  So we're doing a show, and they're going to fucking listen.  Ha ha ha ha!  Best explanation for a radio show ever.  A little better fucking...  We might have to steal that for our fucking... 
[03:48:30]  Chain to the wall!  Steve, steal that for our open, will you?  Fucking drooling mongoloids.  Yeah, exactly.  Chain to a radiator.  Our audience.  God, dude.  Our audience.  It's not Friday without a plug from Brother Joe.  Joe!  Hey, fellas.  Hey, Joe.  How are you, Brother Joe?  What's going on?  How you doing, Bobby?  Joe, what's up, man?  I'm on my way down to Virginia, and tomorrow night we've got a show in North Carolina,  Pelletier, North Carolina, at the Dive Good Times Cafe. 
[03:49:00]  The Dive Good Times Cafe?  In Pelletier, North Carolina, yes.  Jesus.  Nice.  I'm hitting the big time.  Yeah, you've made it.  Yeah, tonight we're at Ned Devine's in Herndon, Virginia,  and then it's another six hours down to Pelletier.  Unbelievable.  Well, we'll be hooking up with our old friend Steve Carney.  Oh, right, yes.  Another former tin knocker made good.  That's right. 
[03:49:30]  What does he do these days?  He's tin knocking.  Are you shitting me?  No, he owns his own company.  Oh, but he owns the company.  That's a little different than fucking hanging out in attics.  Yeah.  That's good.  Fucking cracking attics.  That's good.  Then he probably knows exactly what bad employees do  because he was one.  Absolutely.  We used to just take afternoons off.  We'd go out to lunch, go to the titty bar,  and take the rest of the afternoon.  God, that's the worst boss you could possibly have.  He knows all the fucking shit. 
[03:50:00]  I know.  He would get to a job and somebody would do something.  He'd be like, don't bullshit me.  I know what you were doing.  This should have been done.  You were sleeping.  Everybody stays on the clock.  You don't punch out for that shit.  Oh, fuck him.  Fuck him and his ass.  Fuck him and his ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, Bobby, try getting it up for a girlfriend  that's nine months pregnant.  Oh, boy.  How's that?  It's a Radisson, so it's pretty good.  So it's pretty good.  You're such a sweet lady. 
[03:50:30]  Dummy.  Do you have to have sex, though?  I mean, is that mandatory?  Yeah.  Is it different?  Is it like, does it turn inside out?  What happens down there?  Dude, when you start seeing feet coming through the belly,  when you're face to face, it's rough, man.  But trust me, she still does it for me.  Really?  So, you married old Norm, son of a Gunderson.  He's just thinking about that fucking movie. 
[03:51:00]  I fucking love it.  He won't stop.  Can't stop with a fucking Fargo close.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Margie, let me fix you some eggs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got Arby's on me.  The prowler needs a jump.  So, the baby's coming out soon, right?  Yeah.  Actually, we got delivery dates like May 21st.  Wow.  The second one was a big feller. 
[03:51:30]  Big feller.  Yeah.  Says he was up by the lake.  He's going crazy up by the lake.  I said, we don't do that kind of thing here.  So, I called it in.  End of story.  End of story.  Jesus Christ.  So, there's all in Cape Pelletier.  It's Cape Pelletier, North Carolina.  And I'll be there tomorrow night.  You get a lot of those.  I get a lot of pests that come out.  And I mean, even, you know, I even had a state gig that we do and shit.  And I just like, you know, hey, Brother Joe, play cunt. 
[03:52:00]  No, I'm doing you two tonight.  I can't play cunt.  Babe, the blue ox.  All right, Joe.  Brother Joe, going to be a father soon.  Unbelievable.  Well, you and Donnie, both going to be parents.  So, go see Joe right there in Brainerd.  And I don't want to confuse the issue.  They're pregnant separately here.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  We got Brother Joe.  He's going to be a father in less than a month.  And Don, what, has two months left?  About two months. 
[03:52:30]  I think so, yeah.  And it's going to be an uncle twice.  And I'm having a girl.  Don's having a boy.  I fucked up.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  Fucking A.  What are you going to do?  Are you just going to kill the family name?  Yeah.  I don't.  What the fuck do I want?  With kids.  Nothing?  It's snot on my couch.  Why don't you adopt a little fucking.  Fucking little handprints all over my television.  Why don't you adopt a little Vietnamese gun runner?  That's what I'll do.  Get a little fucking soldier.  A little Southeast Asian fucking soldier. 
[03:53:00]  You and him.  Six years old.  Knows how to work in AK.  Just slap him in the mouth.  Mau!  Mau!  You and Keith.  Girls Anthony hangs out with them.
