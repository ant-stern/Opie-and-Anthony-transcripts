<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Darryl Strawberry's admission regarding steroid use, followed by crude jokes about Alex Rodriguez's hip cyst.  The hosts then transitioned to a joke about NFL players and dolphins, before tackling a news story about a government employee forwarding racist emails targeting African Americans and President Obama.  Opie and Anthony debated their own media consumption habits, emphasizing their efforts to understand extreme viewpoints from both the far-left and far-right. A substantial portion of the show focused on a boating accident where three of four men perished, with the hosts speculating on the possible circumstances leading to the deaths and questioning the official narrative.  The segment concluded with a brief mention of a listener's bizarre 911 call about Chicken McNuggets and an explanation for Eric's tardiness due to a movie.  No specific guests were mentioned in the provided summaries.

[00:00:30]  good morning anthony it's hump day yeah i know 877-212-018 god bless daryl strawberry really  well he's on the news right now he said hey if steroids were available when i was playing  they had to be available he just uh they were available when i was in high school  there's too much time doing coke yeah like it's like oh i could do steroids but i gotta do some 
[00:01:00]  coke he said if they were available he certainly would have done them yeah there you go there's  an honest guy he did pretty well without him he sure did doing other you know drugs but  i think we're gonna get him on the show in the near future he's got a book out there  in the near future and he's saying hey i would have done the roids sure why not if everyone else  is doing them and it would have helped me i would have done them yeah i like that why not especially  back then when you know nobody was uh even peeking in on you yeah it didn't matter everyone uh was 
[00:01:30]  fine with it now it's taboo and guys a rod has to see a specialist yes he's got a cyst on his hip  yeah who cares sure does it call the uh the little man in the boat he's got one of those  it's just hanging off his hip it's like we found out well they didn't say where on the hip it's  kind of in between his hips along with the rest of his vagina you can get a check in october 
[00:02:00]  true we'll be playing baseball and what is that all about perhaps uh everybody's gonna be going  well you know some of the side effects of uh doing steroids are tumors and yeah they'll link it to  steroids that's for sure stay well and uh they called off the search for those nfl players and some  nobody because that's how the news does it two nfl players and a nobody and some guy you never heard 
[00:02:30]  of time uh you you hear that they're now playing uh for the dolphins is that that's the joke all  around wow too soon see they're now playing with the dolphins yeah playing with the dolphins that's  it oh yeah playing for the dolphins i i thought it like that needs a little work a little bumper  all right i'd fix it up needs a little work but playing with the dolphins that now playing with 
[00:03:00]  the dolphins yes okay yeah i'll admit i actually like that one you like it yeah that is it's one  more person morbid it's cute but it fits in yes one more person sends me that joke please no more  there you go it's out there i acknowledge that you've sent it i only get jokes uh that i can't  forward to anybody of course i would never ever have a career of course like another political uh  guy this guy was he was pretty down on the uh totem pole as far as politics go oh but um don't 
[00:03:30]  know his name doesn't even matter at this point just some some other guy that decided it was a great  idea to forward a joke that he got oh the watermelon guy no no no this is a new guy a new guy chock full  of racist material uh yeah talking about uh equating um african american children with um feces  oh nice and uh i mean this was like hardcore stuff talking about uh things about the president that 
[00:04:00]  the secret service would be very interested in um and then at the end of every panel there was this  picture of obama just looking puzzled like his puzzled face all right and then it would start a new  kind of panel with uh more just hardcore racist jokes and another confused face of obama and he's  had no regrets he just said like hey i get these and i just forwarded them to other people i got  and he had no clue what is he like a dog catcher he's like uh he's like an assistant to an administrator 
[00:04:30]  he's very low level but it was it was high enough where it was like picked up and the naacp wants some  action he works at the dmv is what you're saying could even be that it's just low level but it's  another instance of somebody going like what website did you see that on your website last night uh  arian nation uh dot org or it was a storm front yeah yeah or uh one of those yeah you know you gotta 
[00:05:00]  you gotta keep an eye on what's happening because i uh left and right of the mainstream my friends and  i don't mean just going to cnn or fox.com you gotta go to far left and far right websites in order to  really get an inkling of what the fringe is up to that's how you justify it because i i bet you  whatever i gotta do whatever i gotta say i bet you it's 99 to one percent no most of you look at the  other side for one percent just as just so you can come in here and say that you're you know oh no 
[00:05:30]  looking at all sides i read a lot of uh liberal um articles um drudge prints a lot of them believe  it or not to make them look bad yeah so they uh they pop it up and i look at drudge all the time  and stuff and uh fark but uh this racist cartoon you're talking about i have no idea what i i haven't  seen that i heard on mainstream uh that was on mainstream uh media i'll get more info on it uh as far  as who it was mainstream media like what uh cnn cnn had it up on their page um no they reported it on 
[00:06:00]  headline news they reported it yeah all right yeah another guy in trouble blah blah blah i want  to see what uh that's all about yeah definitely got it it was no it wasn't from my normal um uh  trolling of the websites on oh that's what i'm getting at far right and far far left that's what i was  getting at education official resigns over racist email was it an education official could have been  all right yeah by the way i said it yesterday i want to say it again that that boat thing 
[00:06:30]  yeah they they there was only one spot and that guy got it yeah because how they found him him  sitting on top of that boat that boat went over they all got in life jackets and then they realized  wow we can't hold on to this boat yeah and so you know you you turn into a uh you know like  every man for himself you don't care if you're all friends you're panicking you're 30 to 50 miles  out yeah and all of a sudden you're like wow we're fighting for the one spot now i don't care that we 
[00:07:00]  went to college together and we're best buds and we were just fishing and drinking beer then now we're  fighting for our lives yeah he got that one spike it was kind of a flat spot in front of the motor  right where it wasn't really getting uh water washing over it i did this story has legs because  every time they show that boat i'm like there's nowhere else to hang on yeah maybe hang on to the  motor a little bit maybe three guys are going to hold on around that motor yeah the rest of the  boat you can't hold on to that and it all depends on where you were when it happened because uh it's 
[00:07:30]  not like you could just swim over to it a lot of times those waves that was in some pretty rough water  right but you become an animal i'm thinking at that point you're like i don't care we've been friends  for forever there's one there's one spot that is going to guarantee survival and then we're fighting  for it now yeah because just how the guy was sitting up there all nice almost comfortable  just waiting for them to rescue him he's up there and where were the rest of the guys gone so he's  going to be sitting up there and and the rest of the guys are going to kind of be in the water 
[00:08:00]  doesn't make sense yeah this this story isn't over is what i'm saying unless you think i think  they're going to start questioning i'm like okay you said that all four of you were hanging out to this  boat well where were they hanging on yeah you think the story's getting a little fishy  i think the strongest guy won yeah i hate to say that because i'm sure they were all you know  but really good friends and stuff he he was just the one of the guys you think the nfl guys would  have been the stronger guys not this guy played football too he might just be one of these you 
[00:08:30]  know gym rat animals yeah yeah they're all big dudes because he's look at them just sitting up  there where else were they supposed to hold on that is the only place he's sitting right there  the only place you bottom of the boat in front of the engine holding on to the engine and then  have every have you ever been like fooling around with a boat and it goes like you know upside down  like that but you're in you're in safer waters relatively speaking you can't hold her you can't  hold on to anything no you really can't hold on to that fiberglass bottom like that right a wood 
[00:09:00]  bottom you might have you know something encrusted in barnacles would be easy and all of a sudden  three guys are not going to be holding on to if if they could could have that motor yeah  something doesn't make sense but would a couple guys be able to it looks like a couple guys would  be able to hang on to that even if their bodies were hanging like off the boat into the water in  the water that's actually a little bigger than i thought it was um it looks like a guy jet skiing  unless you know yeah he's just sitting on top i'm very suspicious that's all i i have a feeling 
[00:09:30]  there was some kind of struggle to get you know to get safe the other guys were like oh man and  they floated away i don't think bye bye i don't think they maybe they were holding on for just a  little bit yeah you know but if you're in the water and you're holding on with your fingertips and that  guy's sitting up there nice what are you going to do your survival instinct is going to kick in  you're going to turn into an animal and you're going to want that spot right yeah seriously this is 50 
[00:10:00]  miles out 30 to 50 miles out you can barely see land you're panicking you can't do whatever it  takes to survive yeah but they called off the search yeah they said ah we looked we sent out a  bunch of uh helicopters for uh and they're very confident that they really uh took a nice look  because they figure out what how the tides are working and stuff and how uh you know and they  throw other things in the water to see how far it would uh drift and they they're pretty uh they're  pretty smart they've gotten pretty thorough with being able to check i mean when you look at the 
[00:10:30]  don't they have a heat sensor or something too or or some kind of like uh yeah like the high-tech  stuff like the cops use when they're tracking those cars at night and stuff like that and  yeah it's a really sad story but that guy really hasn't talked yet  well he said that their boat they all none of them had no i read the whole story yeah none of them  had on life no but they when the boat flipped they got them they they they uh dove under the boat and got  the jackets out they just couldn't turn the boat back over they could but they all survived it and 
[00:11:00]  they were all clingy for like eight hours wow and uh that's what i wonder about and also eight hours  i don't know man i think those guys float away right away like ropes or just something they could  have fastened themselves to it a little better instead of just depending on your grip especially  in the water you're gonna get uh that hypothermia your muscles just tell you to go screw yourself  or maybe the guy you know the guys in the water because the hypothermia they you know they got 
[00:11:30]  weak and let go and started floating away too like young jack just slithered between the uh or down  uh underneath the uh icy surface even though you know i guess the water was pretty warm relatively  speaking so it is the gulf although even you know they said this was a hypothermia situation yeah  even even like 75 degree water you're staying there long enough you're gonna die of hypothermia  yeah it was colder than that even yeah it was in the 60s yeah most 60s i do believe i'll bite you in 
[00:12:00]  the ass pretty quick so so that's uh that's uh yeah poor bastards that's the first look at what's  happening out there but they called off that search transgeny oh it sucks no matter what all right  we'll take a quick break and uh and we'll continue 877-212-0&a see what you guys are all about  uh the the chicken mcnuggets 911 call is great yeah i've been listening to that one great heard that 
[00:12:30]  one a couple of times last night got some chuckles it is great i love it's like yeah we'll be right  there for you yeah maybe we'll get a movie review from uh eric oh went saw watchman last night he did  yeah the movie was so good that he decided he needed you know get in here really late this morning  oh does he see a movie that's really good every day yeah no kidding he just doesn't want to listen  no he doesn't it's like 15 minutes before the show and he's walking in with his coat on i'm like
