<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Jimmy Norton's upcoming appearance on Don Imus' show, noting Imus' altered voice.  This transitioned into a meandering conversation about Obamacare, right-wing politics, and a listener-submitted "sock foot" trend.  A listener call about "snot rockets" led to high school basketball anecdotes.  The hosts then heavily criticized a previously played song, sparking a discussion about the color of one host's hat (brown/gold/black), veering into commentary on race and fashion.  Magic Johnson's Dodgers purchase prompted a tasteless joke about HIV.

A call from Joe Ratterman, a Jimmy Norton look-alike, followed. The conversation circled back to Magic Johnson and AIDS, comparing his healthcare access to Freddie Mercury's.  Further discussion covered Imus' show, Shaq's guest appearance, and upcoming appearances by Norton and DJ Pauly D.  A substantial portion focused on Troy Kwan's upcoming nose job, with jokes about his vanity and a self-referential picture.

Jim Norton joined via simulcast from Don Imus' studio.  The conversation covered Norton's career, experiences on other shows (including Jay Leno's), political views (derogatory comments about Santorum and Gingrich), Louis C.K.'s online special, and his preference for Opie and Anthony due to the freedom to use offensive language.  George Carlin anecdotes were also shared.

The show shifted to breaking news about a JetBlue pilot's mid-flight mental breakdown in Amarillo, Texas.  Listeners called in, and the hosts discussed the pilot's erratic behavior, alleged Al-Qaeda mentions, and speculation on the nature of his breakdown, including a therapist's phone call diagnosing a psychotic state with paranoid features.

The focus then moved to financially struggling celebrities: Dennis Rodman's bankruptcy and alcoholism, Allen Iverson's lavish spending, Antoine Walker's financial woes and alleged substance abuse, and a brief mention of Dr. J and other athletes facing similar issues.  Nadia Suleman's topless photoshoot was discussed with commentary on her body and speculated surgeries.  The hosts created a "prick list" anonymously naming disliked colleagues.  Alicia Silverstone's unusual child-feeding methods and veganism were briefly mentioned.

A rambling segment followed, touching on plant movement, a bizarre hypothetical about feeding a child (and a phallic stand-in) chewed food, Madonna's daughter smoking, a debate on "emigrate" vs. "immigrate," and whether plants feel pain.  DJ Pauly D's missed appearance was discussed, along with critiques of 50 Cent's "Cocaine" and Justin Bieber's music, punctuated with crude humor.  Christy Brinkley's contentious divorce (with a clip from the Today Show) was also covered.  The NYC Department of Education's ban on certain words on tests (birthdays, dinosaurs, etc.) was heavily criticized with vulgar and offensive comments.

Another segment began with a discussion of school computer access rules, leading to Opie sharing childhood poverty anecdotes. This sparked a conversation about political correctness, including the renaming of “Easter Bunny” and “Easter eggs,” further fueled by a listener call.  Bloomberg's suggestion regarding the NYC mayor's residence was also discussed. A listener challenged the hosts' content, leading to more discussion of political correctness and a mention of their previous workplace, WBAB.  A pre-recorded segment from “Uncle Paul” featured a profane letter to the FCC about MIA's Super Bowl halftime performance.

DJ Pauly D was announced as a guest, preceded by discussion of his MTV show, "The Pauly D Project," other Jersey Shore cast members (Snooki's pregnancy and the Situation's possible rehab), and Jill Nicolini’s brief interview promoting Jimmy Norton. Norton joined for a short interview promoting his work. Pauly D then arrived for an extensive interview about his show, relationships with other Jersey Shore cast members, views on women and dating, and financial investments. The show concluded with promotion of "The Pauly D Project" and a simulcast of a version of "We Are the World" performed by the Opie and Anthony team, followed by further discussion of the JetBlue incident.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Dude, sell it.  Good morning.  I didn't get one this morning, so I'm going to say good morning.  Well, he wasn't in there.  Oh, he wasn't?  Disappointed.  That's too bad.  Good morning to all of you out there. Hi, everybody.  Hi.  We're ready to simulcast Don Ibis.  Yeah, right from the start of the show.  Why not?  Well, our own Jimmy Norton is going to be on Don Imus. 
[00:00:30]  Or actually, Don Imus.  I don't know what's going on with his voice.  Yeah, we were just listening to a little of his show he's on right now.  Yeah, Jimmy's going to be on in a few minutes.  And, yeah, I've always done the Don Imus impression, you know, like this.  Don Imus, Imus in the morning program.  But it doesn't sound like that anymore.  No.  Jim Norton's going to be coming in soon.  Yes, they are. 
[00:01:00]  And the right wing nuts.  You and Hannity, they're...  You guys are what?  The right wing is against Obamacare.  Of course.  Oh, by Georgie.  What's that?  Magoo.  Magoo.  You've done it again.  Roadhog.  Roadhog.  Jimmy Norton coming on.  Oh, I was in the morning program.  Oh, by Georgie.  Oh.  Did he have a piece of his lung removed or something?  I don't know what the deal is, man.  That's bizarre, though. 
[00:01:30]  Meow, meow, meow.  Oh, he did.  Obamacare.  Talking about repealing it.  Listen, I'm digressing.  You're like a drunk at Maureen Dowd's Christmas party.  We're married now, by the way.  14 hours they are.  I love how he does that.  Just announce the time.  Jim Norton is going to be coming in.  How many days do you think, Bernie?  That's such old school radio.  Where you just throw the time in.  Yeah, man.  Everyone knows the time.  Don't, right? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Even if you don't know the exact time, you just have it in your head now.  Yeah, it's always...  Because you're used to your schedule.  And he's done that for years.  No, I know.  It's so funny.  It's just, you know...  It's an old school thing.  Yeah.  I don't remember the last time we actually said the time.  Oh, God.  I just don't remember.  Imagine just, like, talking about, you know...  Yeah, I was fucking...  Oh, my God, what a dump I had to take last night.  My stomach was hurting 15 past the hour.  And we were hanging out.  I was in the bathroom.  What?  What?  You just throw the time in.  Yeah, yeah, exactly. 
[00:02:30]  By the way, your little bit yesterday backfired.  Uh-oh.  I got a lot of people that are enjoying the sock foot thing, man.  Supporters?  Supporters of the sock foot.  Oh, no.  Have come forward.  It's starting a revolution.  I know you wanted to beat me up a little bit, but I think it backfired.  Are people hashtagging I am sock foot?  I am sock foot.  That's right.  I am...  Well, it's actually piss foot, yeah.  I am piss foot.  I am piss foot.  No, they're keeping it high, brother.  They're calling themselves sock foots.  Everybody else is wearing a yellow sock on their foot in tribute. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  Tribute.  Now I understand why the Golden Toe.  Oh, yeah.  The Golden Toe is a very popular sock brand, and now I understand why.  The Golden Toe.  But people...  Not only did people come forward and say, God damn it, that's what I do too.  I got a few people that tried it for the first time yesterday, too.  Oh, man.  And went, holy cow, I never thought of this before.  Of course no one thought of it.  You just don't do it.  Not no one.  Well...  People certainly thought about it. 
[00:03:30]  Wow.  And did it.  But now we got new people doing it.  I'm sure much to their loved one's chagrin.  Sure.  Yeah.  And then someone asked me if I ever did the snot rocket.  You ever do the snot rocket?  I've probably done it maybe two or three times in my entire life, usually on the construction  job sites, where it's just a normal thing to do.  Right.  And it was...  Well, I just couldn't take any more of the stuffy nose. 
[00:04:00]  There was no tissue around it, and you had to.  But I skeeved doing it.  Yeah, you got to blast one out.  Well, I didn't even know that was something that was possible.  And when I was growing up, I played a lot of basketball.  I was on a lot of basketball teams.  I can't even think about it.  Basketball was my first love.  And then you look at someone like Shaq and realize, what was I even thinking?  Yeah.  Really?  I was going to be in the NBA with a monster like Shaq?  Really?  And Bill Madden.  Bill Madden was a kid I went to high school with who looked like he was 30 when he was 
[00:04:30]  17 years old.  He was that kid.  We all have one or two.  And he used to run up the basketball court.  He would run up the sideline and do snot rockets on his way to play defense or whatever.  Oh, God.  Right up the sideline.  Fucking disgusting.  And these weren't pickup games.  We were playing in front of people.  And that's when I discovered you could do that?  Meaning the snot rocket move.  I find it completely disgusting. 
[00:05:00]  I had to work myself up to do it even.  And there's a whole thing to it.  Some people are really good at it.  Others, you know, it ends up looking like some kind of explosion happened.  And I need a lot of absorption material when I blow my nose in any way, shape, or form.  And when you're snot rocket, there's nothing there but your hand.  Hand not absorbent.  No.  Well, that's why we discussed the, you know, blowing your nose in the shower right into your 
[00:05:30]  hand to see what you get.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What do you see what you're going to get?  It's not gold doubloons coming out of there, you know?  It's going to be snot.  Well, that guy, he called yesterday.  And I was reminded, yeah, I do that every once in a while.  Especially during flu season.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Right into the hands of the shower and go, wow, look what I got.  What is this?  Oh.  Your golden ticket music.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  They got to you guys.  They want more production on the show?  Wait, wait.  I need an explanation here. 
[00:06:00]  I'm not just letting this go by.  Look how brave he got.  He's like, I'm going to hit this.  And then he asked him, and he didn't go, um, he was like, we have a golden ticket.  What is, you're like, please, please help me.  You were saying that he snots into his nose, and you say, what do you think you're getting,  like gold doubloons and treasure and stuff?  No, I said gold doubloons, not treasure and stuff.  So there's.  Wait, I don't care what's going on.  I don't either.  I don't get it.  Epic fail.  That is a huge.  Epic fail.  Huge fail.  They both have the word gold. 
[00:06:30]  You guys don't understand that?  Why don't you play Bad Company, Silver, Blue, and Gold?  I would have went with Golden Earring.  Golden Earring?  Radar Love.  How about Heart of Gold by Neil Young?  Oh, that would have been nice.  That would have been good, and just as relevant as what you played.  Sam just laughs.  I stand behind it.  What?  You stand behind it.  That's crazy.  I didn't stand behind that.  He rocked.  I can't accept that.  That's crazy.  I cannot accept that.  He rocked.  He. 
[00:07:00]  To the world.  To the world.  To the world.  To the world.  To the world.  Why did Sam decide to wear a hat?  Oh, that's very good.  That's creeping us out.  Ecstasy or gold.  You could have played that.  Oh, ecstasy or gold.  Sure.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You ask me that every time I wear a hat now.  You rarely wear a hat.  Oh, that's right.  I started wearing a hat off and on two weeks ago.  Why, though?  Why?  Why don't you just cut the hair?  What up, yo?  You're getting married.  You're cutting your hair for your marriage?  No.  Which is right around the corner now?  No.  Jess is.  And you're a fan of the San Diego Padres, I guess?  I've been a Padres guy for a long time. 
[00:07:30]  See that?  Another sign that you're black.  What?  Only black guys wear hats of different teams that they don't even follow.  Yeah.  White guys, they fucking represent their team, and that's it.  No, this hat was bought based on aesthetics.  The gold and black.  Brown.  What?  This is brown.  It looks like gold and black to me.  Well, there is some gold.  Well, E-Rock should play some fucking songs about it, man. 
[00:08:00]  It is a joyful little chipper song, man.  Very nice.  So you bought the San Diego Padres.  Hold on a minute.  Oh.  They were just showing Jim Norton's favorite songs.  Yeah, because I was his new thing.  Who got in trouble?  Kevin Smith, was it?  For not picking all of his top five songs?  Right.  So now I'm just watching it.  If you're on his show, you've got to pick your top five songs.  And they just showed Jimmy's list, but I didn't catch it. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, I'm in the morning.  Top five songs.  We're going to be talking about it since we're back this morning.  What?  By the way, let the record show that Imus just talked for ten minutes and he's already in  commercials.  Right.  We will not be breaking for at least another half hour.  So blow me.  So blow me.  So why the Padres hat?  Just because it looks good?  Yeah.  It's the proper colors?  Well, I went into the hat store and I was looking for a brown hat.  You've been so influenced by African culture.  Yes. 
[00:09:00]  I just wanted a brown hat.  Well, nah.  And I wanted to, but I didn't want a plain brown hat with some kind of trim.  Yo.  Trims, yo.  Some kind of orange or yellow or gold.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Well, you grew up upper middle class, but you're not black, but you do black things.  He loves.  I'm very confused.  He loves the culture.  You don't care about what colors you wear?  Not enough to wear like a San Diego Padres hat because it looks good on me.  Thank you, by the way.  Did you see that compliment? 
[00:09:30]  Thank you for that.  You know, I'm basically saying what you would have said.  Thank you for noticing.  My problem is I'm a Mets fan and their colors suck.  It is.  I've always hated the Mets colors, but I'll wear and represent it.  Although, you know, I'm not really a Mets fan these days.  No one wears Mets hats because they look cool.  It's fucking rough.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  No one goes like, I'm not a Mets fan, but I wear the hats because they look cool.  The colors are cool.  No.  It doesn't happen.  I would just wash it clean and start over with the Mets.  Stop already. 
[00:10:00]  A lot of tradition there.  They try.  They try to throw a little black in their colors and their hats and stuff.  I like the ones that now try to look like the Yankee hats.  Yeah.  Black hat with the white NY in there.  This looks like a faggy version of the Yankee logo.  Sorry, Mets fans, but it does.  No, you're not wrong.  Next pay period, I'm getting a blue hat.  Huh?  Next pay period, I'm getting a blue hat.  Why?  I hadn't even considered that because I want a blue hat.  So are you going to like...  I think it's going to be Cubs. 
[00:10:30]  The Cubs?  Do you like the Cubs?  I don't know if I've ever seen the Cubs play a game in baseball.  See, I don't understand, man.  Yeah.  Where I come from, you like the team and you got their hat.  Yeah.  And sometimes you got a shirt and sometimes maybe a sweatshirt.  A hat!  That was it.  Yeah.  Speaking of baseball, Magic Johnson, big news today.  Fucking just bought the L.A. Dodgers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And speaking of blue hats.  Yeah, that's true.  Dodgers, you get the blue hat.  And it does go right back to AIDS because someone tweeted me first thing this morning, 
[00:11:00]  Looks like the Dodgers have HIV!  That was his tweet.  Looks like the Dodgers have HIV!  What does that mean?  Magic Johnson buying the Dodgers.  I mean, it doesn't even really...  It sounds like...  Is that how it's transferred?  That makes as much sense as E-Rock playing that gold song.  What do you mean gold song?  I don't understand.  Did he play a gold song?  Oh, there it is.  It's gold, Jerry, gold!  Ha ha ha!  Uh, James might be on.  Uh, nope. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, the beautiful piece of ass.  She is really...  God damn it, she hot.  You know what it is?  It's not this oozing sexual...  She's just a very pretty girl.  What do you mean?  God.  She's dressed for TV, though.  You get her...  That's what I mean.  You get her out on the town.  She's in the tight jeans and the cleavage is showing.  Gussie her up.  Oh, yeah.  You're fingering her under the table while the appetizers arrive.  Did we...  Oops.  Ha ha ha!  A little...  Oops.  Did we ever figure out her name or something?  Is that Jim Norton? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, no.  That's Joe Ratterman.  Joe Ratterman.  Guy looks like Jim Norton with a mustache.  Ratterman.  Not really, actually.  Uh, yeah.  So, really quickly, before Jimmy comes on, Magic and his investors bought the L.A. Dodgers  for $2 billion.  The most ever spent on a fucking sports franchise.  Wow!  And in second place was, uh...  Ah, fuck.  Does anyone know offhand?  It was for $800 million.  Oh.  So there's a big jump between one and two. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  $2 billion to buy the fucking L.A. Dodgers.  $2 billion?  That's just...  I don't know how they make their money back anytime soon.  Yeah, that's like something that generations from now will make their money back.  Right.  How do you...  $2 billion.  The second one was...  Cubs?  No.  The blue hat team?  Looks like what?  Uh, the Dolphins.  The Miami Dolphins.  The Dolphins?  The Dolphins?  I don't know if it was the Dolphins.  The Dolphins.  That's not what I saw on TV this morning.  Sorry, the D-alphins. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, man.  He's...  I don't know where he's from.  He's an alien.  Dolphins.  Dolphins.  Yeah, it's a dolphin.  Dolphin.  A dolphin.  Dolphin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, dolphin.  Yeah, dolphin.  Okay, good.  That's interesting.  You know, there's an interesting point someone just brought up.  Yeah.  The fact that, uh, he goes, Magic Johnson's aides are older than me.  Like, their reveal, that's very funny.  Sure.  Truth. 
[00:13:30]  Truth, Diggins.  Um, yeah, Magic Johnson's aides are older than some people.  And, and, you know, I'm just, okay, Jimmy's still not there.  Um, yeah, it just shows you some people get better health care.  Period.  You think that's it?  I mean, there have been some rich people that have gotten fucking the AIDS and died.  You think Freddie Mercury was broke?  Yeah, but Magic Johnson was bigger than Freddie Mercury.  Yeah.  And, uh, Freddie got a little early in the, in the, in the, in the whole, uh, game. 
[00:14:00]  Well, Fred, didn't, uh, Magic get it pretty early in the AIDS game?  Mm, I, he probably got it, uh, just when they were figuring out some super drugs behind  the scenes, I'm thinking.  Yeah?  I think.  Huh.  And he probably, I don't think Freddie was, um, very, um, Freddie was probably like, ah,  it's just a code.  Right.  It's just a code.  Like, Magic was like, uh-oh, I better have this checked out.  I think I got the AIDS.  Thank you very much, Andy Murphy.  Yeah.  I'm gonna go with.  Rumor has it they might have, I don't know.  Whoa. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah?  Not with each other.  Oh.  They might have went to parties.  Shared something?  I don't know.  There's rumors.  I really don't want to get into it.  I have no idea.  I don't know what Bartlett's doing.  It's Paula Deen.  He does Paula Deen?  Yeah, he does.  He's a man.  Let's just watch fucking Imus.  I know.  Oh, that's what we should do, just watch Don Imus.  Imus, good morning, sir.  We're flying with Paula Deen.  Oh, my God.  Used to be, uh, have that bass in his, uh, in his voice.  Now it's like this.  Oh, boy. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, my man.  How cool was Shaq yesterday?  We're stalling because Jimmy was supposed to be on at 6.15.  I know.  What's going on?  Shaq was very cool.  I loved Shaq.  You think he fakes it or is he that charming to everybody?  That's his job to be charming.  You know, he's a, he's a pitch man now, pretty much.  He's an endorsement guy.  He's got his business dealings.  So he's got to meet a lot of people.  He's got to be a pleasant gentleman.  Yeah.  And he does that.  But I think he's sincere.  I think he's genuinely like, he enjoys, uh, and it's funny because he's like, when he  first sat here, he was like, I'm a real funny guy. 
[00:15:30]  I'm, I'm, I'm hilarious.  I'm funny.  And it's almost like it's a joke.  He's like, really?  I know.  Well, well, when are you going to be funny?  That's what I kept thinking of myself.  His quote was, I have the greatest sense of humor.  I have the greatest sense of humor.  Can we get Troy Kwan to make a montage of all the times he said, I'm a very funny guy?  Because I know he said at least five or six times.  I am Troy Kwan.  We'll get, we'll get Sal to do it because Troy Kwan's getting his nose job this week.  Oh, right.  He didn't even know he was gone.  He has to get that bimp taken off his nose. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  He gets a cosmetic surgery.  It's cosmetic, right?  He wants to say that it's for some breathing thing, but it's to take a bump off his nose.  So he's even, uh, even more sexy and hotter to the chicks when he's spinning.  He just wants to be hotter to himself in the mirror.  Exactly.  Oh, is he caught up in his own self?  He loves him.  He loves him.  He loves himself.  Troy loves Troy.  Troy's in that Kim Kardashian category.  He just loves.  Loves it.  Instagrams himself. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Just loves himself.  Can't get enough of it.  With his hair.  Do you think they're letting him, uh, what does he do?  He's got to get the nose job.  Mm-hmm.  Do you think he does his hair before he even goes in to get a nose job?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  His hair's proper.  All showered up and fresh.  And his hair was perfect.  It's all about being fresh, right?  Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Chris.  I'm saying that because DJ Pauly D's on the show today.  You gotta see it.  Yeah.  That Jersey Shore this year was a bust.  Yeah.  It was boring as all hell.  Just Dina falling down a lot. 
[00:17:00]  Huh?  Just Dina falling down a lot.  She's a pig.  Ripping off Dave McDonald.  That's right.  Dina is a pig.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the only reason they're doing another Jersey Shore is because, you know, the Snooks  got pregnant.  Mm-hmm.  So they know they could squeeze out another fucking season.  Squeeze out.  That's the only reason they're doing it.  Yeah.  I think it was pretty obvious it was time to move on from the Jersey Shore thing or recast  it.  And then the Snooks gets pregnant.  So they're like, fuck.  Yeah.  A pregnant Snooki on the Jersey Shore?  We can fucking work around that. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  But then the sitch goes to rehab.  And then the sitch goes to rehab.  Yeah, but then they say sitch isn't in rehab because we need the sitch to be partying  his ass off with the unit.  Right.  Yes, the unit.  Have you seen this asshole?  Oh, God.  The unit's a douche.  Just when you thought, like, actually, we've had them all on and they turn out, it turns  out they're all cool guys.  But the unit takes it to a whole nother level of douchery.  Of douchery.  Of douchery.  He thinks he's really famous, too.  Coming up shortly, coming up shortly on the morning program, Jim Martin, comedian 
[00:18:00]  in the office, you'll be here with us.  Oh, God damn it.  All right.  So we're almost at Jim Martin time.  Almost there.  By the way, let the record show that Imus is now in his second commercial break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is how good we are at this.  What a piece of cake that would be.  Fuck!  Yeah.  By the way, Troy Kwan, picture of him that Sam just pulled up, looks like he's ready to  sing, no, I want to fall in love.  What is that picture? 
[00:18:30]  That's his old profile picture on Facebook.  No, I want to fall in love with you.  Who did that song again?  Chris Isaac.  Chris Isaac.  Give me some Chris Isaac for Troy Kwan.  He's sitting on what looks like a rock or on the beach.  It's black and white.  He's not looking at the camera.  His hair is done up in that style.  He's wearing sunglasses, a basic t-shirt.  A white tee.  A white tee.  It looks like it could be taken in the 50s.  With some of his tats showing. 
[00:19:00]  That's really funny.  I'm going to get an old job.  I'm going to do my hair.  I'm going to put on shades.  I'm going to fall in love with Troy Kwan.  He is Troy Kwan.  He is.  Why didn't you come up with that sooner?  I don't know.  The picture just looks...  I'm going to do that all day now.  Grab that pic and post it because it is fucking... 
[00:19:30]  And I'll do production for Opie and Anthony.  But I love Troy Kwan.  He's just on the beach with himself.  Falling in love and kissing himself.  It's exactly like the video, only it's him and him.  He's in love with Troy Kwan.  The girl who's all over him is him.  Is him.  He's got bits of sand on his lips and they're kissing. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, I love myself and I want to be able to kiss Troy Kwan.  They're rolling in the surf together.  It's Troy Kwan and Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan and Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  What a dick.  Troy's a dick. 
[00:20:30]  He loves himself.  Loves it.  Oh, God.  That's hilarious.  I wish I could do that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Come on.  He's a fashion plate.  He's a model.  Look at him.  Do you remember in the video, he's slowly running through with himself into the water and then back onto the beach.  That's hilarious.  Oh, I want to fall in love with myself. 
[00:21:00]  There it is.  I want to fall in love with myself.  I want to fall in love.  I already am with Troy Kwan.  I wonder if he would have approved of my shirt today, that fucking asshole.  I used to come in here with sweats and stupid long sleeves and now I have to dress for our radio show because of Troy Kwan. 
[00:21:30]  He likes sharing his...  I'll be honest, because of Troy Kwan.  He loves sharing his fashion knowledge.  He looked at me in disgust one day.  And well, he should.  And I haven't worn sweatpants since.  Except a mirror.  Yeah.  He loves the mirror.  Troy Kwan, what is the greatest invention of humankind?  Well, I love a mirror because I can see myself in it. 
[00:22:00]  Whatever happened to this guy?  Oh, yeah.  He kind of fell off the face of the air.  It's like having a talk show or something.  Yeah, something on Showtime for a while.  Well, I want to welcome my next guest.  He just talks like that to everybody.  Well, I enjoy your movie.  Well, I saw it last night.  Because that's all I know this guy for is going, I don't even know the rest of the song how it goes.  I just know.  Well, I...  Too good, Ant. 
[00:22:30]  Too good.  Hey, someone's calling me out.  Money equals better health care.  Steve Jobs.  Oh.  I think Steve Jobs would have died a lot sooner than he did, sir.  Yeah?  I think he had the pancreatic cancer in a bad way, but somehow they kept him alive for a while there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Or you might be absolutely 100% right.  Maybe they can't figure out the pancreatic cancer thing. 
[00:23:00]  That's one of them that's like, ah.  Hey.  He also didn't get it treated for a long time.  No.  He was very busy.  To appear for a second.  Oh, my God.  When is Jimmy going to be on?  But it's making us wing it.  I like when we just wing it.  Oh, I love that.  I'm fascinated, though, when you really look how little time Imus spends on his show.  This is our future.  It's fascinating.  What are we doing?  Yeah, Imus, good morning.  We've already talked more than Imus will his entire program.  6.35, we're back. 
[00:23:30]  36 minutes past.  There's Jimmy.  How's it going?  From the program, Jim Norton.  Good morning, Mr. Norton.  Thank you, Imus.  How are you?  I'm fine, baby.  How are you?  Good, good, good.  Jim will be on Opie and Anthony this morning.  You're starting when?  7 to 9, because I'm here, so I missed the first hour of Opie and Anthony.  Well, I get along with them well, because I like them.  Yeah, they're good guys.  One, they're funny.  And two, they and you stuck up for me when it wasn't even necessary. 
[00:24:00]  So I appreciate that.  Yeah, that's okay.  I was happy to do it.  It was selfish, though, because I was worried that it would filter down and eventually hurt me.  You know, everything I do is selfishly motivated.  So how long could, I know you're in this building a lot and gut fell and that kind of stuff,  but how long could you, with your peculiar sexual appetite, how long could you work in  this building without just being taken away?  Probably about 45 minutes.  I tried to get a Fox contributorship, and they were like, no, we just can't do it.  And I don't blame them.  I mean, you can't marry yourself to me publicly. 
[00:24:30]  Like, I'm cute to have on, but you can have anybody on as a guest.  But once you put the Fox name next to me, there's going to be problems.  There would be one there.  Yeah, of course there would be.  I mean, the first, you know, holly daddy, the first six foot five woman who came out  with an Adam's apple and said, you know, could describe the inside of my apartment with  the lights are dim.  It was funny watching Rob do his bit this morning, too.  It's like, very accurate.  Yeah, I always like it when guys like you come in or Colin Quinn or somebody, because it  gives them an opportunity to pick up some pointers and so on.  Yeah, it really does. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, Colin's also a dysfunctional.  I think he's the one that set me on the tranny train, because Colin is deceptively  disgusting.  He is?  Yeah, he really is.  Like, you wouldn't think it, because you can hardly understand what he's talking about,  but he is a deceptive perv.  Oh, so?  He just is.  He's the one.  He's like, I'm trying.  It's okay.  He just kind of opened up my mind and go, it's okay.  I'm kidding, of course.  So are you in the T-ball?  I don't know.  No, not at all.  No.  Why would I be?  I mean, I don't know.  I think it was just a PR move by the Jets.  He didn't win anything, and I think they're just kind of doing it to passively, aggressively 
[00:25:30]  give the middle finger to Sanchez.  I don't like football at all, though, but I'm a Cowboy fan.  Well, if you like the Cowboys, you like football.  You like that part of football, right?  Nah, but not even that anymore.  Jerry Jones is just like a nudge.  So, no, I don't watch any sports.  Most athletes I've met I hated, and they didn't like me either.  Jerry Jones looks like the kind of guy who uses the fact that he's the owner of the Cowboys  to try to have sex with the cheerleaders.  He does exactly.  That's exactly what I would do.  I mean, I kind of relate to him on a personal level, because I would do nothing but just impose 
[00:26:00]  my will on the team and try to get laid with it.  But, I mean, you know, I don't own a football team.  It's going to be at Caroline's tomorrow night, right?  Tomorrow through Sunday.  Can we schedule another show?  And then you go on a simulcast.  And then you're on some tour.  I'm shooting an hour special in Cleveland, so I'm kind of just warming up for that April 28th.  The special is for what?  It's going to be on Epix.  It's going to be on Epix, and then in nine months, Comedy Central.  But the first nine months is on Epix.  So, tonight through Sunday, he just said, you'll be at Caroline's. 
[00:26:30]  And then April 12th, you'll be at the Improv in D.C.  Yeah, my first time there.  It should be a real hoot.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm just being sarcastic.  I'm panicked everywhere I'm going to see 40 people in the room.  It's humiliating.  Do you think, what's his name, is funny?  What's his name?  Jay Leno.  I like Leno.  Yeah, I mean, Leno.  I guess you don't have to say anything.  No, no, but I will.  I really do like Jay because there's this impression that he's not edgy as far as a late night guy goes. 
[00:27:00]  But I get away with more on his show than on any other show I've done.  Really?  I'm surprised with the content they let me get away with.  Yeah, I've said some pretty harsh things on Leno.  And I'm like, that's absolutely going to be edited.  And they leave it in.  And he's the only guy that addresses certain racial issues that other guys don't address.  So, yeah, I love Leno.  Okay.  And then you'll be at the Cincinnati Funny Bone in Newport, Kentucky.  Yeah.  It's a fun, fun city.  You know, you just kind of go there just to hang out in the city and get to know the people. 
[00:27:30]  And then at the Playhouse Square in Cleveland, Ohio, where you're doing this hour special?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's when we shoot April 20.  I want to get it shot already.  Like, I just want to get it done.  I think I'm ready to shoot it.  But they didn't have the venue available until the end of April.  You know what I thought was, you know Louis C.K.?  I do, yeah, for years.  Funny guy, isn't he?  He's great.  He's brilliant.  You mind if I, it's like Rob and Tony, they don't like it when I mention another.  It's like you have authors on, and if you mention another, somebody else, like they don't  think anybody else ever wrote a book.  Yeah.  It's just them.  So if you mention other authors, they get all, you know. 
[00:28:00]  Where's he going?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I actually bought his.  The thing he did online?  Oh, he was the first one.  Yeah, yeah.  I bought it.  How was it?  It was good.  Yeah.  That was funny.  It's also great that he's doing that because he's setting a precedent for comics because  we're all such slaves to the networks and their standards and practices.  But guys like Louis can do it.  And Aziz Ansari and Jim Gaffigan, these guys are really blazing a trail for other comedians  that will be able to do it.  I probably won't.  I'd make $30,000 if I did it. 
[00:28:30]  Louis will make a million.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, aren't you pretty popular?  Moderately.  I'm popular.  I'm more popular than I should be considering my level of talent and appearance, but I'm  not as popular as Louis C.K.  Wasn't your book a bestseller, New York Times?  It was, wasn't it?  Both of them were.  I mean, I don't like to correct, but yeah, both were.  Sorry.  I mean, it's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Jim Gaffigan at 17 till they are.  He's going across the street.  Don't they cross the street to Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, they are.  We're neighbors.  They are in the, you're in the Fox building and they're next door in the McGroy Hill building. 
[00:29:00]  He'll be over there at 7 where he can say really icky stuff.  So it's icky stuff.  How is that being on a, where you can drop the AF bomb all?  Phenomenal.  It's as good as you think it is.  I mean, it really is.  It's, and you don't wind up over, excuse me, you don't wind up overusing the language.  It's not about the language.  It's just about the content that would get me in trouble on regular radio.  Like I can do a 15 to 20 minute spot easily, but if you gave me four hours a morning,  it'd be a problem.  It's great to be able to say whatever you want.  And we can.  So are you into politics at all?  Yeah, I don't like any of them.  I mean, Santorum wants to attack porn and heavy metal. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, why doesn't he just pull out a gun and shoot me?  I have nothing else.  I don't like, I basically like none of them.  I find Newt Gingrich to be irritating.  Oh, yeah.  Just a skunk vomit, we call him.  Oh, really?  Okay.  And Santorum's name is Butt Juice.  Although we did, didn't we, somebody opt for Butt Puss, right?  For Santorum burning?  Yes, as I recall.  Yeah, so, but I'm not sure. 
[00:30:00]  But, Carly, do you remember which one, Butt Juice or Butt Puss?  Butt Puss came in the lead.  Yeah, Butt Puss won.  Just the way to get it.  Butt Puss.  Yeah, yeah, she's fantastic.  Butt Puss.  Butt Puss.  He's just a creep.  He looks like a creepy social studies teacher.  He's got that stupid smile and that dopey Potsy Weber hairdo.  I just can't stand him or Gingrich.  I think of all of them, Biden is the only one who I feel kind of relates to regular people.  He's worth like $1,100 I think he's amassed in his entire life.  The rest of them.  It's funny to hear Mitt Romney talking about just the average American and he's worth $200 million. 
[00:30:30]  It's like, come on, guys.  Or do it, but we don't want somebody like you or Larry the Cable Guy to be president, do we?  No, but you picked really bad examples.  You know, I mean, a pervert, a dumbbell.  I mean, there are other examples of average citizens than me and Larry the Cable Guy.  Well, all right.  Now, Joe the Plumber.  Yeah, Joe the Plumber.  It got a little tired of him, too.  Yeah, that schmuck ran for something, right?  He lost, didn't he?  He won the primary.  Yeah, but what happened to him, Bernie?  November. 
[00:31:00]  November.  He won the primary.  He's going to run against Kucinich's opponent in the primaries.  Kucinich's seat is what he's running for.  What does that vote for?  Who do you hate less?  What a terrible couple of options that is.  Well, who's he going to run against?  Kucinich lost to some woman out there in Ohio, and he's going to run against that woman in November.  So George Carlin used to tell me, and other folks used to, who I love George Carlin for a lot of reasons, used to come in with his computer, you know. 
[00:31:30]  Always have his computer with him.  And no matter, I mean, why he would prepare for this show, I have no idea.  But he would, so.  But he used to, whenever there was a tragedy, which I thought was kind of cool, like there's an earthquake someplace, and they say there's 340,000 deaths, you know.  He would root for that figure to go up.  Yeah, he would, heavily.  So I was wondering about the karma of that, but it is funny, so unless you're one of the people who's, whatever. 
[00:32:00]  He lived to be 71.  I mean, that's not bad.  I mean, considering the amount of drugs Carlin did, if life was fair, he probably would have dropped dead at 40.  So he obviously had decent karma, because he lived a long time saying horrible things about everybody.  That's what I am now, 71.  Oh, you look like you're 50.  You look great.  I could go home any time then, couldn't I?  I love you, but if you did right now, how great would that be for my Caroline's appearance?  Everybody would be showing up.  What was it like, his last interview?  Well, you know.  Oh, shit, Jimmy.  It's a quarter to the hour.  A quarter to the hour.  Conan O'Brien, you ever pair with him or you don't like him? 
[00:32:30]  I've never done, no, I have nothing against Conan.  I wouldn't go on now, I guess, because I don't think they'd have me on because of my association with Jay.  But the guy who booked his comedy comedians for years didn't like me, and I didn't like him.  So Conan was never an option for me.  The soccer mom, madam, you into that?  I would love to have known her.  I mean, I know a lot of prostitutes, but the high-end madams are just, you know, I can't blow $2,000.  I can't do it.  I mean, Craigslist, 300.  It's like a massage head with a wink face next to it. 
[00:33:00]  You're like, that's pretty much my speed.  If it's over 350, you know, I want a whole night.  But we're rooting for the black book to be released.  Well, supposedly there's a lot of politicians and a lot of, I love when famous people, when it's like revealed that they love prostitutes.  But not because I want to see them get in trouble.  I just, I feel closer to them and their life feels like more attainable to me.  Like, I never had anything in common with Tiger Woods.  And then it's like, oh, he's, you know, picking off hookers.  I'm like, God, I could be this guy.  So I feel a certain kinship with guys like him and Anthony Wiener. 
[00:33:30]  14 till they are talking with Jim Horton.  I love the time.  Caroline's on Broadway.  Have you ever been asked to be on the Trump Apprentice thing?  No.  Would you?  Of course.  I mean, it's easy to have integrity when nobody's asking me.  Like, I wouldn't sell out, I miss, but believe me, I would do anything.  I'd show up nude in tap dance for 30 seconds before the commercial.  I'm desperate.  You watch Jersey Shore?  I do not, but Pauly D is going to be on Opie and Anthony this morning.  So I've seen moments of it, but no, I don't watch it.  How's that going to go for him with you?  Oh, sure, it'll go terrific.  We've had him on before. 
[00:34:00]  And Opie and Anthony know what he does.  I don't really know.  I took a picture with him.  I want to get it signed today.  I'm just a weasel.  Well, nice to see you.  Say hi to them.  I will.  And thank you for supporting our show.  You don't even have to say hi.  We heard it.  You're more than welcome.  Jim Norton, Opie and Anthony.  And tomorrow night at Caroline's on Broadway.  13 now till Lyon.  Hey, good job, Jimmy.  That Jimmy's so funny.  Good job, Jimmy.  Oh, that Jimmy Norton.  It's funny because Sean and Nancy writes,  I'm his searches for words the way Eric searches for his jogging shoes. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, God.  Sorry, Rock.  Oh, boy.  Another fat joke.  Oh, your Caroline's on Broadway.  That time thing is weird.  It is so, like, distracting.  That's where a laugh should be.  Jimmy's killing it and all of a sudden, 14, 14, 14.  Jim Norton.  Oh, hey, it's 746. 
[00:35:00]  You've done it again, Magoo.  So, they're in their third commercial break, Anthony.  Yeah.  We still have him broke here.  Although we just sat for 10 minutes and watched.  Yeah, we just watched and listened to another radio show.  It was a segment.  It was a segment.  It was Jimmy.  Yeah, but if people are used to us, they hear Jim's voice, they just assume that it's our show.  Exactly.  I like that.  And I think we both shoved wet cotton up our nose and put a bag over our head and gargled with Clorox. 
[00:35:30]  Nice.  I'm in the morning.  So, when is Troy Kwan's nose job?  It was yesterday, I think.  Oh, he's recovering.  And Eric posted.  Oh, I'm recovering.  Well, I'm.  Troy Kwan.  The sex man posted a Troy Kwan gallery on the Opie and Anthony Facebook.  Oh, good.  Yeah, so you know what we're talking about.  Oh, that's perfect.  Yeah, look at that.  Facebook slash Opie and Anthony.  Oh, bravo.  All the good pictures.  Well, I love myself. 
[00:36:00]  Well, I wish I could marry me.  Because I don't find anyone attractive but myself.  Oh, she warning.  Oh, man.  And he is a dolt.  He loves himself.  Oh, my God.  This is hysterical.  What's that?  The Apple TV is going to be good.  All right.  And finally. 
[00:36:30]  I thought someone already put it together.  The Troy Kwan, Chris Isaac video.  Oh, wrong.  That picture is the best.  He is just.  Well, he wants to be a model, obviously.  A model.  He's a hustler.  A male prostitute.  Oh, I love Troy Kwan.  On the beach.  Rolling around with himself.  Making out.  But it's not gay because it's him.  Right? 
[00:37:00]  No, you can't be gay for yourself.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like touching the other Troy's lips with his fingers.  Slowly.  The other Troy's shutting his eyes behind those sunglasses.  They both are dressed exactly the same.  No, it's not gay because it's him.  Yeah, I see.  Why don't we do this?  Jimmy's crossing the street.  We can break here.  Right?  Yeah.  And we got a lot of things to talk about.  Things? 
[00:37:30]  Things.  Do we have things?  We got Christy Brinkley breaking down.  Oh, I think I saw that clip.  That's a divorce thing, man.  Yeah, some prompts.  You can relate to this shit.  Maybe not the breaking down part, but where it just fucking eats away at you inside.  Holy fuck.  And the divorce was in 2008.  So this is still four years later.  She's still dealing with it.  Yeah, they're still working on shit.  It's like screwing a life for you.  That's what she's saying.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  This guy's like really fucking with her.  It's what her side of the story is.  I don't know.  Yeah.  She could be trying nasty, dastardly things with him. 
[00:38:00]  And then we got to talk about Octomom posing nude.  Octomom.  And then we also got to talk about the JetBlue pilot.  Well, Octomom.  I just can't stop doing it now.  Well, Octomom.  She's nude.  People are already leaving comments on his pictures and say,  Oh, really?  And, oh, I want to fall in love with myself.  We should do Chris Isaac News with Anthony Cumia. 
[00:38:30]  A look at the headlines.  JetBlue pilot went nuts.  Would be scared shit.  I got lost his fucking mind.  You know what?  We'll start with that.  We got to do the JetBlue thing next.  It needed the money.  Huh?  The open air to the show.  There comes a time when we hear a sudden call. 
[00:39:00]  When the world must stand together as one.  There are people dying.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  God, he had a great one yesterday, too.  Good morning, sexy.  This one's good, too.  Oh, he is defiant today.  Defiant E-Rock.  Yeah, why don't you just look in and give fingers to the bosses? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, E-Rock.  Oh, thank you.  Put it there.  This is our version of We Are The World.  Yes.  Featuring a lot of people you know and love from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Tinkle fall.  We are the world.  Do you know, I didn't recognize this was this version.  Did you think it was the real one?  I swear to God.  Who was the first one singing?  Mustard.  Yeah, Mustard.  Oh, that's why.  He sold it.  I'll be honest with you.  I thought so, too.  Because I haven't heard the song in a while.  So I might have to apologize to E-Rock. 
[00:40:00]  It has our spin on it.  Is that E-Rock?  7.05 a.m.?  Huh?  That's the virus.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock, thanks for reminding us about the virus.  The virus did that 7.06.  It's 6 after the hour.  Yeah, you got to do 6 after the hour.  He doesn't even do digital.  No.  Why would you do digital?  Oh, Patty.  With her angelic voice.  A demonic body.  You can't let them suffer. 
[00:40:30]  You can't tell them the way to something.  All right, turn this off.  Fuck it.  I don't like this one.  It's great.  Or maybe shoulders.  Nothing but love.  Oh, God.  We are the children.  Oh, wow.  We are the ones.  Oh, wow.  This one's star-studded.  Remember, logistically, to get everyone together?  It is the choice.  Excuse me.  He can't be bothered.  He has his sweater coat on for the taping. 
[00:41:00]  I know.  Fucking ants.  What an asshole.  What a Ronnie rush out.  Big A.  Seems a little bit of hope at all.  Oh.  But if you just believe that there's no way we could fall.  Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Let us realize that a change can only happen.  When we stand together as one, give yourself a meal. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, God.  Listen to this.  We are the children.  We are the ones.  We make proud of the name.  So let's stop.  We can't go.  Let's stop.  Kill them.  There's a choice we're making.  Oh, cunt, cunt.  Piece of shit.  Cunt, bitch.  It's hot, though.  Oh.  We'll make a better day.  Just you and me. 
[00:42:00]  We are the ones.  We are the ones.  We are the ones.  We are the ones.  I'm doing my Bruce scream in the background.  Auto-tune Kenny.  Auto-tune Kenny.  Why don't we do Auto-tune Kenny anymore?  Let's bring that back, too.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  It keeps going.  Wow.  We're never trying to get everybody together.  It was like the real one.  It was so difficult.  It was well done.  Sam took this on with who else?  Troy.  It was me and Troy.  Yeah, man.  You guys did a great job.  Well, I took it on.  Well, I...  Troy wishes he had a Troy Kwan to work with on that one.  So it was Troy and Troy producing it. 
[00:43:00]  Well, I love myself.  Well, I'm getting a nose job.  Well, I'm going to make it just like Chris Isaacs.  Well, I want to make love to myself.  Troy is in love with Troy.  He loves Troy.  Hey, why the We Are the World there, Iraq?  I know, but why don't you tell the listeners there, please?  Well, 26 years ago today, 6,000 radio stations played We Are the World at the same time. 
[00:43:30]  They simulcasted it.  Oh, God.  I bet it was a big thing.  Here we go.  We're less than a minute away from the big playing.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Are we ready?  Turd!  We're going to be playing We Are the World, turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Let's take a phone call first.  Well, I love your show.  Hi, it's Anthony Comey.  I really love your show.  Ah, thank you.  Let me hang up on you, turd. 
[00:44:00]  Turd?  Turd?  Are we ready for the simulcast?  Well, here we go.  We're going to be playing this song, We Are the World.  I'm Jim Norton from the future.  Me are my Georgie.  Me are the world.  It's Jim Norton at 7.05.  He doesn't do the digital, though.  No.  Five after the hour.  It's Mike, but I mean, it's a widget.  Jim Norton back in studio.  And Jimmy, you did a great job over there.  Yeah.  Across the street, as they like to say.  I love Imus.  I was just worried I was going to say something bad.  That's the only thing I worried about was, like, you don't want to slip and say something 
[00:44:30]  that's going to get him in trouble.  I've got to help.  Even Dutch.  I've got to help you plug, because Imus fucked it up a little bit.  You're not at Caroline's tonight.  Oh, no.  Tomorrow.  I probably didn't even catch that.  Yeah.  Thursday through Sunday at Caroline's.  Tickets still available, but not many.  Not Saturday.  Not Saturday.  So.  Seven.  Oh, fuck.  Two, one, two.  Seven, five, seven, forty, one hundred.  Yes.  Seven.  Okay, good.  All right.  Yeah.  What is this Uncle Paul Super Bowl thing, by the way?  Oh, that's a new production piece that we put together.  All right.  We'll play it a little later.  I hope it doesn't highlight Uncle Paul. 
[00:45:00]  Our papers have the best headlines today, man.  Oh, man.  What a story.  There's one.  The Daily News, their front page says, Jet Ready to Die.  Jet Ready to Die.  Instead of Get Ready to Die.  And it's the lowercase J, like Jet Blue does.  And drama of Jet Blue Flight 191.  Say your prayers, crazed pilot screams.  Sprints through cabin, terrifying flyers. 
[00:45:30]  Oh.  And then the post has, this is your captain freaking.  JFK Jet Blue pilot goes nuts in midair.  And they got him in a chair.  They got him in that yellow.  And it looks like handcuffs.  Strap him into that yellow wheelie chair that they just wheel lunatics off of planes in.  Yeah.  He lost his fucking mind.  And he just snapped.  Is there more to this story yet?  Because this hit yesterday.  I mean, was he off his medication?  I don't know.  I don't know if I want my pilot on medication, by the way.  I bet you that it was some kind of a, I bet you so many of these guys take antipsychotics. 
[00:46:00]  I'm just guessing.  Yeah.  But it has to be something like that.  Because he's obviously a smart guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if anybody saw any indication before he got on the plane, they would have said something, I bet.  You know.  Isn't it amazing that not more of these guys have just crashed their planes in crazy moments?  Like, not to freak anybody out, but they're just people and they have these moments.  And look at fucking JetBlue, the flight attendant, and then this guy.  There have been a couple of cases, but thinking with all of the...  Air Egypt, I know.  Yeah.  Air Egypt was a bad one. 
[00:46:30]  That was a horrible one.  What are the details here, Ant?  So...  Well, this guy, they took off.  They're flying around.  New York to Vegas flight?  Yeah.  Okay.  He started acting a little erratically in the cockpit.  Okay.  And the co-pilot somehow got him to leave the cockpit and then shut the door and locked it.  Wow.  They must have known each other for a while.  Don't they usually know each other, the pilot and the co-pilot?  Well, not necessarily celery.  Not necessarily celery.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but...  I like celery. 
[00:47:00]  I know.  It's one of those deals where he started acting a little weird and he threw him out of the cockpit  or got him to leave.  Right.  Locked the door and then the pilot lost his mind, started banging on the door saying,  let me back in.  And then he's going up and down the aisle saying, we're all going to die.  We're going to crash.  Imagine seeing the actual captain of your plane walking up and down the center aisle saying  that you're all going to die.  I'd say, boy, your bedside man is sure needs something to be designed. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, absolutely, Jimmy.  That would suck.  Oh, man.  It's just horrifying.  The anxiety you would feel.  I was saying earlier, you know, when you're flying on a plane, and I'm not a fearful flyer  or anything, but if you hear an odd noise, you're super aware of it.  They got a video of him.  Oh, my God.  Our ship is destroyed.  Oh, my God.  We got Israel.  We got Iraq.  We got Israel.  We got Iraq.  We're going to get down.  Oh, my God.  Iraq.  We got Israel.  We got Iraq. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Can we get that?  I want to play that whole thing, please.  Yeah, he just lost it.  We should have that audio.  Holy fuck.  He lost his fucking mind.  Yeah, you said it like, you know, when you're flying and you feel a little bump or something,  you're not used to, it freaks out, obviously.  You're just super aware of what's going on.  You're, like, you know, hyper aware.  The pilot put in a chokehold restrained by passengers on a trip from New York to Las Vegas.  The pilot, after he suffered an apparent mental breakdown in the middle of a flight,  you can hear him ranting about the Middle East and a bomb and the plane going down.  And a man on the way. 
[00:48:30]  On this video here, that's when a group of passengers, who are on their way, by the way,  to a security conference, jumped into action.  That's so bad.  That's good to have on the plane.  Guys that were on the way to a security conference.  Yeah, no kidding.  Rush right past him and towards the front of the plane.  He started to curse at me.  He cursed me and hit me.  So I said, you know what, I'm going to show you what our act of the plane is.  I'm going to chokehold.  Take a look at these images. 
[00:49:00]  The pilot being wheeled off that plane, restrained in a stretcher before he was taken away in an ambulance.  That is in a crazy chair.  The pilot, quick thinking, somehow got him out of the cockpit, locked the door behind him originally so that he could not get into the cockpit again.  All right, Newt Gingrich.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wee.  That is, uh...  Wow.  That's frightening.  So he's running up and down the aisle, basically.  Yeah, yelling.  Or walking up and down, yelling and screaming about the Middle East bombs and...  Yeah.  And there were a couple of people on board.  They, uh...  Got him down on the ground. 
[00:49:30]  Tied his arms up with some, uh...  Seatbelt extenders.  Right.  For the fat people to use those things.  And then, uh...  They took him off the plane.  They landed the plane.  There was apparently another pilot on the plane, also.  So he went in and helped out the co-pilot with, uh, you know, the landing procedure.  But let's break this down.  The guy leaves the cockpit at first, and he's having this breakdown.  But at first, you don't know it's a breakdown.  All you see is him yelling and screaming that he wants back in the cockpit.  Now you're thinking, fuck, did this...  Somebody got control of the cockpit.  Did someone else get control of this fucking plane? 
[00:50:00]  It would be...  I'm amazed people didn't drop dead of heart attacks on this thing.  It would be horrifying to see that and not know actually what's going on.  Right.  You know, you'd just be like, why is the pilot out here banging on the door saying, let me in.  We're going to crash.  Oh, fucking no.  They landed where?  In, uh, Amarillo, Texas?  I don't understand why they have to land the plane immediately.  If they got him and he's all strapped up nice, how about you get everyone to Vegas?  Yeah, yeah.  How about you get everyone to Vegas and not inconvenience them anymore? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to go to Vegas.  But I guess the FAA regulations is like, land the plane as soon as possible.  Yeah, they had to do that immediately.  You got him in a good position, then fuck it.  Let's get to Vegas.  Yeah, we got a pilot that was just back here.  You know, he could fill in.  And then you get someone on the, you know, the speaker there saying, look, you know, he might scream a little bit, but we got him.  We're going to get you to Vegas.  I don't know.  I tend to believe that when one of the people flying the plane has to be restrained due to mental breakdown, it's a good time for an unscheduled landing.  You'd want to be off that plane immediately, obviously. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, because what if the other guy said nut two?  Yeah.  No, I know you're right.  Like, what if this fucking lunatic freaked out because the pilot, watch it be that this guy was right.  Oh, my God.  And the guy left in the cockpit actually whispered, I'm going to crash this plane a la Akbar.  They're going to cry.  They're going to cry.  I love we live in a world of Twitter because then everyone tweeted.  Oh, they did.  And they got the better ones in the paper right now.  People on the plane, huh?  Our pilot went nuts and we had to land in Amarillo.  I am never flying JetBlue ever again.  What are the odds it's going to happen again? 
[00:51:30]  Saw my life flash before my eyes today.  Unreal.  It was dull.  You stink.  This was the highlight of it.  Yeah.  JetBlue.  You might be able to pick her off.  That's Tiffany Lee at T733.  Oh.  She might be a little vulnerable right now.  Vulnerable?  A little, um, oh, well, yeah.  Then we got this guy, Grant.  He writes, okay, it was our actual pilot.  He started to lose it.  The co-pilot noticed and got him out of the cockpit.  He started going crazy. 
[00:52:00]  Then you got Allison.  How did he get him out of the cockpit?  It's a good question.  He said, go alert the passengers.  Yeah, yeah, he did.  He somehow, I would like to hear how he did that because, uh, it must have been brilliant  to get a lunatic out of the cockpit.  That's fucking scary.  Thank God.  Imagine they're going into fisticuffs in there and the door's locked from the inside.  Oh, my God.  And then the pilot overpowers the co-pilot.  Imagine if it was, like, me and Kenny flying the plane and Kenny was the fucking nut.  Oh, God.  Over.  Fuck.  That could have been a whole other story that we were talking about going, oh, my God, 
[00:52:30]  today, they listened to the flight recorder and, oh, boo.  What about if he knocked out the normal pilot or whatever, the one that wasn't fucking freaking  out, and now you got the guy having a mental breakdown, but he's the only guy that can fly  the plane?  What would he have done, you think?  You think he would have crashed it?  He probably wasn't.  It didn't sound like he was in any condition to fly a plane.  He might have landed it really rough.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, just fucking forgotten that she dropped cabin pressure and just started diving down. 
[00:53:00]  But, I mean, he still knew how to fly a plane, but who know?  Yeah, but he was crazy.  He was just, like, going off, yelling.  Allison tweeted, pilot on my brother's JetBlue flight to Vegas had a panic attack.  Crew had to lock him in bathroom and emergency land in Texas.  Deranged pilot.  What?  Iraq, Al-Qaeda, terrorism, we're all going down.  Deranged pilot.  Wow.  Oh, that's what he said, I guess.  Jesus.  That's what he said.  That's fucked. 
[00:53:30]  According to Witness, that's what he heard.  Okay.  And it's the pilot, so you're like, oh, it's got to be true.  Oh, the pilot.  And then there was a guy, David Gonzalez to Fox News.  The pilot started banging on the door to let him in.  Why did you change the code?  We got to drop this plane to 7,000 feet.  Oh, my God.  Foof.  Why did you change the code?  You would be freaking out if you were in your seat.  Yeah, why didn't you change the code?  Please let us know.  The pilot in command elected to divert due to a medical situation. 
[00:54:00]  Everyone is safely on the ground.  God, that's a bore.  Oh, of course.  That's the JetBlue people.  Yeah.  That's what they tweeted.  The pilot in command elected to divert due to a medical situation.  Everyone is safely on the ground.  Yes, don't worry about it.  There's some PR shit.  Yeah.  There's some spin for you right in your face.  Well, I guess more of the story will come out as to what happened to this gentleman.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  Perhaps it's like that Coney 2012 guy. 
[00:54:30]  You know, just snaps.  And that's it.  Starts taking his clothes off.  That would have been funny.  Yeah, of course.  Take his clothes off and just start running around.  Crazy people love taking their clothes off.  Why is that?  I don't know.  They want to show their dick.  This guy didn't.  Look at my dick.  We got Steve the therapist.  What is he going to add to this?  That was a nervous breakdown.  It must have been.  Even us dummies know that.  This guy is going to speculate having no knowledge whatsoever.  All right.  Let's go with it then.  Steve the therapist in Connecticut. 
[00:55:00]  Hello.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Good morning.  It sounds like this guy was entering a psychotic state with a lot of paranoid features.  I mean, that's a nervous, a so-called nervous breakdown doesn't operate the way he was behaving.  All right.  Fair enough.  What's the difference between the two then?  A nervous breakdown is usually anxiety-driven.  That's true.  What he was doing was his imagination just completely went into turbo overdrive and lost  into reality. 
[00:55:30]  That shit can happen to any of us.  Oh, man.  If you have a psychotic illness, it can.  Well, how do you know you have a psychotic illness?  What are you saying?  I have a psychotic illness?  Exactly.  What are you getting at?  I have psychotic illnesses.  Please tell me what you're getting at, sir.  Who's been saying that?  What are you hearing through these airwaves?  Who's been saying that?  Am I fucked up?  Anthony, you're just a pedophile and an alcoholic.  Me!  My guess is he'd probably stop taking his medication if he's 49.  He probably has had this condition under control for a very long time. 
[00:56:00]  I'd stop taking his meds.  I don't want a pilot that has to take any type of medication.  No.  I want a nice and stable.  Exactly.  He deals with it.  He walks it off if he's got a problem.  Right.  He walks it off because he's a man.  Flew an F4 Phantom in the NOM.  Is he?  That's what I want.  I don't know.  Oh.  Maybe he did.  There are people walking around right now.  If they decide not to take their pills for a couple days, they're complete lunatics on  the fucking street.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  We have to count on them to take their medication.  Oh, boy.  Well, we are in a very medicated society, as they say.  Prescription drug use is so, so way up.  Rampant.  But it's like up from where it used to be.  Increase in the use of, thereof.  Sean, and then see again.  A panic attack?  No.  Troy not having any hair gel?  That's a panic attack.  Well, I need some hair gel. 
[00:57:00]  Well, I want to fall in love with myself.  Well, I'm getting a nose job to look good.  Do you think Troy put himself together nicely today, even though he's recuperating from his  nose job?  Oh, fuck.  His hair has done perfect.  He got all fresh.  He probably put makeup on under his eyes so his black eyes wouldn't show so much.  Yeah.  It's a concealer.  And you know what?  They look good on him. 
[00:57:30]  Two black eyes.  It's going to be a new fashion statement.  Yeah.  Well, he wears those sunglasses a lot, so it doesn't matter.  He's wearing a navy shirt so they match his black eyes.  You think even with the bandage on his nose, he'll do a shot where he's slightly turned  to the right, his chin is in his hand, he's looking up at the camera, and black and white.  I think so, yeah.  I think so.  Look better with my nose and bandages than most people do without. 
[00:58:00]  This only has one view on YouTube, JetBlue captain subdued after erratic behavior?  They're all over now.  I mean, this video has been copied over and over again.  Let's listen to this.  It's not that good.  Like, the best you've heard.  We got it?  Yeah.  All right, fine.  Let's cut our losses then.  That's fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Cut them losses.  Oh, wow.  That's the story of the day right there, huh?  Yeah, motherfucker.  It's not going to get better than that.  Although the octamon posing nude.  I know. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The fuck is that about?  Although they put her gut back together, I noticed.  Did they?  Yeah, man.  What does that got to look like?  I don't know.  They got that tummy tuck figured out, I think.  Oh, God.  No fucking way.  I'm telling you, Chris, look, considering.  There's no way they could fix that.  Considering.  I don't know.  Sometimes she looks really doable, and other times she looks horrendous.  I always get her confused with that Spider-Man villain.  Like, when I hear Octomom, I just think Doc Ock. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, very good.  Yeah.  Oh, there she is.  Look at her.  Oh, come on.  What is with that tit and everything?  She's got to trim down those eyebrows a bit.  They're a little too bushy.  Yeah.  That's my first complaint.  We have to watch a commercial before we get to see her nude.  She had eight fucking kids in there.  Huh?  She had eight fucking kids in there.  Oh, yeah.  Hi, I'm Jessica Bedencheese for E! News Now.  Hi, Jessica.  How are you?  Hello.  Hello.  What's this, Jessica?  Tell us the news.  ...by posing topless three years after giving birth to her octuplets. 
[00:59:30]  Nadia bears almost all in the...  God, all right.  It's not bad, Ant.  No, that's the world of magic going on there.  Fuck a moment.  That's a lot of work done.  You're right.  That's a lot of work.  Look at her ass.  So...  Look at the ass meets thigh right there.  Where did she get the money to put her body back together?  Maybe she should have used that money to feed all those kids.  Because I guess she's broke.  So now she had to go with the nude thing to get a few bucks.  And you know why she's holding her tits like that?  Holy mother of Christ with the hurt that must be on those. 
[01:00:00]  You think there's a bit of a droppage thing happening?  I think there's an issue.  You think?  I think the nips are pointing down like a divining rod.  Let's take a look.  What are the pictures?  Maybe she didn't want to show the boobies.  I think she's holding them in place like mercury.  You think?  It's like holding liquid...  They're ample, though.  She got implants in there.  I don't know.  She must have got the implants.  She's getting the tummy tuck.  She's wearing like some nude colored... 
[01:00:30]  Couldn't even airbrush that out a little bit.  Bottoms.  Look, I would have sex with her.  Just saying.  Just saying.  Yeah, you know what?  In that picture, she looks a little bit like...  She does have an Angelina Jolie vibe to her face.  She's not as pretty.  But I would...  The eyebrows would have to go.  But besides that...  Yeah.  I mean, I'd be interested to see...  Let me see the stomach.  You know they airbrushed a whole lot of...  Oh, my goodness.  She's got almost a V thing happening.  But her ass...  You can tell her ass is right.  Her ass is long and awful.  Long and wrong.  We used to see in the neighborhood. 
[01:01:00]  Looks like a sucked out lima bean.  That's a badass.  It sure is.  I thought the pictures would be a lot worse.  Me too.  So, what are you going to do?  I don't know.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying I wouldn't cram my thing in her shitter.  Your thing?  Yeah.  Call her thing.  Yeah.  You want to listen to a psych nurse about the JetBlue guy or no?  A psych nurse?  She's going with bipolar.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, what's next to...  What next to...  Polar got to do... 
[01:01:30]  Oof.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Chip, Jim.  That really just ruined the flow.  In other celebrity news, Dennis Rodman is reportedly broke and sick and owes nearly one million in child support.  Holy mother of God.  That's who I was hinting at with Shaq yesterday.  Yeah.  But I felt like he didn't want to really go there.  But there are a lot of NBA players that you kind of know and love that are broke now.  Broke and extremely sick. 
[01:02:00]  Dr. J, too, I think, right?  He says...  Dr. J is broke.  Allen Iverson is broke.  No.  Iverson?  Yes.  Iverson is broke.  How is he fucking broke?  He was trying to make a comeback because he needs the money.  Oh, he's not playing anymore?  I'm not sure where he's at right now, Jimmy.  He might be playing somewhere.  I don't know.  Dude, how is he fucking broke?  He made a shitload of money, too.  What did he invest in?  And then there's a guy named Antoine Walker who's playing in the D-League because he needs cash.  And he was like an all-star.  A cold in the D-League?  A Boston Celtic great. 
[01:02:30]  And there's a bunch of them.  Dennis Rodman, by the way, the sickness thing.  Sorry, Antoine.  Oh, please.  I didn't want to acknowledge that.  I should have went with that.  Dennis Rodman, his sickness is acute alcoholism.  It's adorable.  Aw.  That's what you say when you say his alcoholism.  Aw.  And you pinch his little red cheek.  Aw.  He loves his alcohol.  We learned from Dr. Drew.  Yeah.  He's another graduate of the Dr. Drew program.  Oh, great.  Another success story.  Yep.  But Dr. Drew's all over fucking CNN.  He's got all sorts of shows. 
[01:03:00]  And here we sit.  Unbelievable.  His program kills people.  Yeah.  Literally.  And he's allowed on CNN and everything.  Yeah.  As a professional.  Fuck.  He's the go-to guy.  And he's a graduate.  They have a graduation ceremony and everything for these celebrities when they graduate, right?  Yeah.  Sam, you know that show.  Oh, yeah.  You get a silk pillow to use later.  See?  Because they're going to die.  That's funny.  Rodman was defiant to the help.  Like E-Rock.  Defiant today.  But then in the end, he turned his shit around because he graduated the program. 
[01:03:30]  Did he go into Sober House, too, Sam?  I don't know.  I don't think he went into Sober House.  No?  He obviously didn't need it.  He can't come up with a million bucks?  Dennis Rodman?  I know, right?  Well, he...  How the fuck do you spend all that money?  He was living quite the lavish lifestyle.  But he was also getting paid for appearances and all sorts of shit.  Probably cash.  And he'd tax them.  Yeah.  You know.  Wrong people around him?  I bet.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Fell in with a fast crowd.  Mm-hmm.  That's...  Expensive dresses.  So what is he going to do now, Sam?  Rodman?  I mean, I guess he's going to have to...  He's going to have to start signing.  He's going to...  They're talking jail time for Dennis Rodman.  Whoa, for what?  You think Michael Jordan bills him out?  I don't think so.  No way.  Why?  He helped fucking Jordan get some rings.  Why not?  Yeah.  I doubt it.  Who knows if they even like each other?  Who knows?  Who knows if the worm gets along with Michael Jordan?  I love using sports nicknames. 
[01:04:30]  He's going to have to go start signing a lot.  A lot of autograph signings.  Cory in Rockland says, Rodman is so broke, he's actually doing a signing at a wrestling  con this weekend.  See?  What?  For WrestleMania?  Oh, he must be at Wrestle Reunion.  By the way, I'm very happy that the company finally did the right thing.  You know how we always bitch, Ant?  No.  I never noticed.  We gotta.  We gotta.  We gotta fucking acknowledge when they do the right thing.  What happened?  E-Rock and Sam are going to WrestleMania. 
[01:05:00]  No.  Sirius XM's done.  Oh, that's right.  They're not.  No.  And E-Rock's bitching like a motherhugger.  Oh, I bet he is.  I just said motherhugger.  I noticed that.  I thought I was in a time warp.  Yeah.  I'm still trying to get that fucking face going.  Even though that's wheezes.  Put it on a shirt.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  You're a little pissed off, huh?  A little bit.  Why?  All the years that, you know, Sam and I have done WWE-related material and interviews and  whatnot for this show.  At the expense of the listeners, no less. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  And so, you know, WrestleMania's this weekend in Miami and you think, hey, you know, Sam  and E-Rock maybe should go down there, do some interviews, see the events, what have  you.  Did you guys pitch this to the bosses?  We've pitched in the past.  Not this year, though.  They should just know, right?  That you guys are the biggest wrestling guys around here.  And have major connections with the WWE.  Who's going to WrestleMania from the company?  This show called Busted Open.  Busted Open?  It's about girls I fuck. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Bust them open.  No, no, their heads.  There's a bloody paint can next to them.  Oh, shit.  How great would it be to swing a full paint can into somebody's head by the handle?  That would be fun.  The inside of your fingers would hurt from the weight of the fucking metal handle digging  into your fingers.  Oh, you would split their head wide open, though.  I want to hit somebody's skull with a full paint can so hard the back of the can opens  and the paint shoots all the back of the can.  That's good. 
[01:06:30]  That's smacking someone.  Yeah, Rodman is a hardcore gambler as well.  That's coming in.  I have heard that over the years.  That's fucking terrible.  I thought Brutus the Barber Beefcake was dead.  No.  All right, listen to this.  A British Bulldog.  Oh, yeah.  I always confuse those two.  I want someone to back this next story up because I've heard things about Allen Iverson  as well.  Loco Man 075 on Twitter writes, Allen Iverson spent $15,000 every away game on a brand new 
[01:07:00]  wardrobe because he would leave them behind in the hotel room for the maids.  Wow.  Dope.  Is that true?  I'm reading somebody else's telling me that.  I don't fucking spend.  Same thing?  Some guy, the great Guedini, says Allen Iverson is broke because he's a degenerate gambler,  and this is off Twitter, and brought a new wardrobe in every city he went to instead of packing.  First of all, wouldn't that itch so much?  Shit makes you itch.  And that would just be a hassle after a while.  But is that true?  Like, to spend money that crazy?  Well, what does Dice do? 
[01:07:30]  Dice wears socks and underwear all he wants?  Yeah, Dice will go on underwear and sock-buying binges, but Dice is on it.  I mean, that's not as bad, obviously.  No, Jesus.  He's not spending $15,000, and he'll take most of it home.  Oh, I'll fucking wear my socks until those holes appear, man.  Dude, it's fucking awful.  They look like fucking fingerless gloves, my socks.  My toes is just hanging out and shit.  But then you put on a fresh pair of socks, and you go, why am I not wearing new socks all the time?  All the time.  It feels so much better.  Oh, when those socks slip on.  I think it's lazy. 
[01:08:00]  Sinatra wore new socks every day.  Like, he hated re-wearing socks.  That's a little Sinatra fact.  Here, on a new feature on the Opie and Anthony show called Boring Facts by Jim.  I think I love knee socks.  What?  I think I like girls with knee socks.  I do, yes.  I like when their hands are bound with them.  Great look.  Yeah.  They're just twiddling deep.  Jim is in a marlin mood.  No, not hurting them.  Just tickling them.  I like to bind a girl's hands and then just tickle her.  Yeah.  That's a fetish of mine.  I have to tickle her until she shits on the bed.  It's very sexy.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  And then it's the humiliating factor.  She's like, enough, enough, enough.  You just pick up the tootsie, and you take your finger and go,  on the bottom of the tootsie.  I tickle really harshly, and I dig my knuckle into the bottom of the foot,  and I go, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.  I tickle like a psychopath.  Let me say hi to Doug in Boston.  Doug?  Hey.  Did you hear Shaq apologizing to Boston yesterday? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  What?  Kind of half-hearted.  He was kind of bummed.  He was hoping it was going to work out for him in Boston.  They would win a championship, and then he gets to walk away nice from the game.  Oh, nice and shit.  Just trying to talk to you, Doug.  Jesus.  Yeah.  It's called a conversation.  It's called a conversation.  Look into it.  Easy, Dougiekins.  If I did that little conversation, someone else would have something to add to it.  Yeah, right.  I wasn't a big Shaq fan.  I thought it was a bust at the beginning. 
[01:09:30]  You did, huh?  At the beginning?  All right.  Yeah, I didn't think he was going to do anything.  Well, we talked about it when he went like, uh, I'm one of the funniest people you know.  Oh, hello.  You know, but then he turned out to be pretty goddamn funny.  He talks low, but I really believe that's because he stuttered when he was a kid, and  you learn how to just talk without doing that.  Because he is a fucking goofball.  I mean, he just fucks with people.  And a lot of people said they had to turn down their bass because of...  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Did you notice that?  Yeah.  Yeah, he...  You get that bassy voice on there.  Bo, bo, bo.  That's that just resonance that a huge body gets.  He's like a Bose speaker.  And yesterday's complaint, because these assholes have a complaint every day.  Shaq's mic was too low the entire interview.  Well, Shaq was moving...  We tried.  We fucking rode his fucking mic as best we could.  Yeah, he was talking low.  He just talks really low.  And he backs up and goes forward to it.  But there's only so much you can do. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, we do what we can, man.  What do you got on the Iverson, Doug?  He actually turned into a raging alcoholic, and a bunch of teams cut him.  And they were like, he's going to drink himself to death.  And now he's playing in Europe and Romania.  But is he really broke Iverson?  What was his contracts?  Do we know?  Iverson broke millions and millions.  How many years did he play in the States here?  He earned roughly $154 million.  From his salary or everything?  Over his NBA career.  Okay, so that probably includes endorsements, I would assume? 
[01:11:00]  I would assume.  All right, so say after taxes, agency fees...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  $154 million in the NBA, and even more through sponsorship deals.  And the sponsorship deals, I bet you come close to that number after a while.  A lot of these guys make more money endorsing than their salary.  That's crazy.  But Shaq is a fucking smart dude, though.  He went and got his PhD.  He's going for his PhD.  That's what you got to do.  You got to know what you're doing in business, which I don't.  Or just spend wisely. 
[01:11:30]  I don't think Shaq has to make another dollar in his life.  Oh, dude, God.  But he said that he would go when he met with people from money management.  I don't know if he said this on the air or off, but the guy that said,  I can double and triple your money, he ignored.  And the guy that goes, no, oh, yeah, he did say this on the air.  The guy who said, I'm going to put it in annuities or whatever he said, that was the guy.  The jeh.  My jeh is really a fucking bore fest, but I know he's doing the right thing.  That's it.  You got to deal with his dumb jokes and his stupid fucking stories.  Well, it's the morbidness that I can't. 
[01:12:00]  And the morbidness, but in the end, the jeh knows where to put my money.  They're very good with the accounting.  Oh, he stinks.  He just wants to relate and fucking goof around with you.  I'm like, shut up.  Just fucking tell me where my money's going.  All right.  And there you go.  There's the door.  Antoine Walker was on intervention for crack addiction.  No.  Stop it.  No.  Stop it.  I'm calling you out, Chris in Georgia.  Can you prove this? 
[01:12:30]  Hmm.  Yeah.  Chris, you're holding up the entire radio program.  Hello?  Ah!  Stop it.  I'm calling you out, Chris in Georgia.  This is a person just listening to the radio.  Chris.  Chris, you called the show.  I can only hope the car is against the pole. 
[01:13:00]  His face is embedded in the windshield.  And the radio is just playing and playing with his fucking cell phone in his bloody hand.  With the wheel still spinning because it's off the ground.  God.  God.  Big clumps of grass on the fucking bumper.  A boy can dream.  A boy can dream.  We just assume they're just idiots.  But maybe they were in some horrific fucking action.  He's dead.  You got to think over the years.  One person, that's how it ended.  Oh, well.  And then we pick up.  That's right before we pick up. 
[01:13:30]  Or no, because we pick up.  Hello.  What do you got on Antoine Walker?  Intervention.  Crack.  Anything, Sam?  I don't think so.  Was he a zombie or something?  I think we would have known.  That's not funny to call people zombies.  They're going to get sued.  Antoine Walker, I said.  Oh, what's he running to?  Antoine Walker was well on his way of becoming one of the greats, man.  And then I don't know what the fuck happened with his career.  It fell. 
[01:14:00]  Fell.  That's what happens.  But was it an injury or something that started that shit?  No.  It's got to be frightening, too.  I mean, it's frightening enough to be in any bit of the entertainment business, because  the job security is not there.  You know, you hope to make enough in the time you are in that when the end just comes  out of nowhere, that you have enough and you've been smart enough to continue living  a kind of lifestyle you're accustomed to.  But these sports stars, you know, they're like, hey, they're living the life. 
[01:14:30]  They're relatively young.  Right.  And it could just end the next day where it's like, hey, you're making a bunch of money.  You're back and make nothing.  Well, you know what I did, Ant, over the years?  What's that?  I've been spending like this was going to last three years.  My dad always said, you know, spend below your means and you'll be okay in the end.  So I'm like, all right, I think me and Ant got three years in us.  Three years.  We're up to 17 and a half.  I'm good.  Yeah, yeah.  Of this horse shit.  17 and a half. 
[01:15:00]  Something like that.  Local newspaper says Allen Iverson is broke because he owes his jeweler $900,000.  He is.  What?  He does.  No way.  $860,000.  But how is that not payable when you've made $150 million?  Well, the jeweler sued him and then the judge said you have to pay him $860,000.  Wow.  And then that's when they found out he didn't have the money.  God, I hope he owes Steven Singer $860,000.  Did he go to Singer?  A warehouse of broken, like, roses with whatever they're made out of. 
[01:15:30]  Glass.  Yeah, glass roses.  He would just like to step on them.  Be careful.  We're going to be selling those things again, I'm sure, in the near future for Mother's Day.  I have a nice blue one at home.  It needed the money!  Ow!  Everything blue needs the money.  It's like Sam's new hat will be when he gets his blue hat.  He was talking about his blue hat he's going to pick up.  Next pay period.  He's wearing that hat right there just because he likes the colors.  He doesn't know the team.  SD.  Like a black guy.  Sam's a douche.  That's what the SD stands for.  I think it's San Diego. 
[01:16:00]  It's not San Diego.  I think.  Sammy douche.  Sammy douche.  You want to know why Antoine Walker's broke?  Yes.  All right.  Because we remember him from our AAF days.  And we might have, well, maybe we shouldn't talk about that.  We know why he's broke as well.  Well, yeah.  Let's say hi to Mike in Toronto.  Mike.  Mike!  Mike.  Actually, there's an article in the New Sports Illustrated about Antoine Walker.  He's playing in the D League in Boise, Idaho.  What's that next to Girl Z? 
[01:16:30]  If Antoine Walker shimmies, but it's in Boise, is he really shimmying?  Well, in his career, he made $70 million.  He made $70 million.  Wow.  He made $70 million and he's broke.  How does that happen?  I don't understand that.  That's got to.  Is it the black culture?  How do you lose that?  Do white athletes do the same thing?  No.  White athletes, white boxers, white fucking.  White athletes are just as stupid.  But you don't hear as many train wrecks. 
[01:17:00]  That's true.  Because most athletes probably come.  Because most black athletes probably come from poorer situations.  And they bring everyone along with them, right?  And there's less money management.  Probably stressed it when you grow up in the projects.  Yeah.  And it's hard when you, I think a lot of people just trust the wrong people and get mixed up  with bad business managers and get in tax trouble.  You know, it's like Shaq was, when he said, he went with a guy that knew to put it away.  It's like a guy that's honest with you and tells you you're not going to make 10 times  your fucking money.  That's how Madoff got people.  Because anyone who taps into that greed, he was telling them, yeah, you're going to get 
[01:17:30]  11 points on your money.  Right.  It's like, don't you see how crazy that is?  Yeah.  You're not getting 11 points on your money.  Well, I've always heard if it's too good to be true, it probably is.  I heard that too, except for my mother's kugel.  It was to die for.  It was better than it could be true.  Oh.  See, that's different.  It sure is.  She'd make kugel, I'd say it's to die for.  Kugel.  Yeah, I used to love a nice, bland bowl of kugel.  Oh, my God.  Kugel.  You ever eat kugel?  It's like eating wet shoes. 
[01:18:00]  I hate it.  Kugel stinks.  I think that stupid Brooklyn Diner has it, right?  Yeah.  The food's great there, but they try to shove that kugel down your face.  Probably $58 for a noodle.  Yeah, of course.  No, it's not that much.  Oh, stop it.  It is.  I've been there.  Allen Iverson's not actually that broke.  I'm reading that too, Sam.  So how about I get the fucking credit for this?  How about you let the boss say it?  How about I get the credit?  How about I get the credit?  It's not credit.  I mean, it's just in an article.  You can read it.  You're going to trump me.  But if I say it, I look knowledgeable.  I don't think anybody was going to say, boy, you hear Sam with that fact today? 
[01:18:30]  Supposedly, he did get a guy, this Allen Iverson, like Shaq.  And what the guy did, because he knew this Allen Iverson was so irresponsible.  Look, see, Sam?  I don't have to read the article.  I'm having a conversation about it.  It's called a conversation.  Look into it.  The guy put, depending on who you believe, up to, some say up to $50 million in a trust  fund that he can't touch until he's 50.  Ah.  So he's broke now because he can't touch this shit until he's 50. 
[01:19:00]  That's like we...  Well, if you have a structured settlement and you need cash now, call J.G.  Wentworth, 877-CASH-NOW.  Well, how about that Indian thing?  How about that Indian thing?  Is that the same place?  Oh, no.  The, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mmm.  Come to us for heap wampum.  Mmm.  And then we rape them, you, for even more wampum.  Mmm.  Yeah, you get a thousand bucks from those people and you got to pay back a hundred thousand.  Something like that.  It's a crazy amount of money.  So he's not broke.  He's broke now, I guess. 
[01:19:30]  He lives off the interest.  I guess he doesn't have his money with Bank of America.  He'll be getting less than one percent.  He better be pretty interesting as well.  I don't understand that.  That sounds like me.  Don't steal my voice.  That's what I talk like.  Sorry, Charlie.  Don't make me sound bad.  How do the banks get away with giving you less than a one percent interest?  They're such pieces of shit.  Yeah.  We remember the days, unfortunately, we were just youngins being, you know, child of the  80s and what's not.  It was yesterday, I remember.  I remember my parents were getting like 10 percent at the bank, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they were getting crazy interest. 
[01:20:00]  They were getting 10 percent when we were growing up.  There was pretty much, everybody talked about if I had a million dollars, I'd put it in  the bank and I'd live off the interest.  And people were literally able to do that.  Which would have been 100,000 a year.  Yeah.  Who can't live off 100,000 a year?  What?  Five years ago, I had 7 percent interest for seven months.  Really?  Wow.  How do you get that deal?  Oh.  Oh.  My bank, I think it's barely 1 percent.  I think it's less, like Jimmy.  Yeah.  And then they're trying to get you with all sorts of fucking hidden fees and everything 
[01:20:30]  on top of it.  I have a small...  It's almost like you're not making...  You're actually losing money so they could have your money.  Yeah.  Almost.  I have fucking a small business account with Bank of America and there's such pieces...  I'm getting zero interest.  Yeah.  Zero on a checking account.  So I looked into the savings account thing and then that's less than 1 percent.  And I don't have enough to go into a real business account.  I don't make enough money.  Aw.  It's got to be a small business.  Aw.  But there's such fucking...  What kind of small business would you have?  Just, you know, myself being incorporated where I sell... 
[01:21:00]  Oh, but wouldn't you have...  I sell the Jim Norton brand.  I sell Jim Norton wherever I go, Greg.  Ralph Cramden Incorporated.  Then you re-reinvest it.  You re-re-reinvest it.  Let's start small businesses for ourselves.  Hmm.  Real dumb small businesses.  I want to open up a...  I want to open up a little, um...  A pantry.  A pantry.  I don't even know what that is.  I don't know.  My mom used to have a food store.  Pantries suck.  I was going to get an annuity, but I'm like, let's just get the old one. 
[01:21:30]  You know how that works?  Ah!  A lot of chip today.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  We noticed that.  So, Mikey, what do you know about Antoine Walker?  Um, well, he, uh...  He's 34 now.  He doesn't...  He's at 32.  And apparently the ball boys in Boston were saying that he would send him out to McDonald's  for a $4 meal and peel him off a 40-buck tip.  Yeah, but that's easy.  That's not going to, like, make you go broke. 
[01:22:00]  Why did he go broke?  What was his thing?  The other thing was he was raised in Chicago, and when Jordan was making his comeback with  Washington, Jordan asked him to work out with him in Chicago, and after they'd worked  out, they'd go to the casinos, and apparently Jordan was a guy who'd, you know, gamble a  million at a time, you know, and Walker was trying to stay and he was trying to keep up  with him.  Oh, my God.  Why would you do that?  I have heard that.  I have heard that. 
[01:22:30]  Because if you sit down with Jordan, you're going to look like a fucking dummy if you  put your cute little $1,000 chip down.  What's that?  When he's doing...  Oh, why'd I say that?  When you got Jordan doing a million dollars a hand or whatever he was doing.  Kevin Hart told a story about that.  When Kevin was on, he said something about that where you try to keep up and you just  can't...  And he wouldn't loan him money.  Jordan's like, I don't do that.  Wow.  He wouldn't loan him.  Jordan will not gamble with anybody either.  Apparently, you're not allowed to gamble with him.  He's got to sit at his own table.  But I guess Walker was sort of around him, seeing it, and sort of showing off. 
[01:23:00]  At that kind of level, you really don't want anybody with you or anything like that.  In my, relatively speaking, lower bracket of gambling, I will get a reserved table that  just me and some close friends can use.  And then I'll play like that.  And they, of course, if there's a big, pivotal hand coming up that a lot of money is on,  they'll pretty much ask me what I want them to do in that situation. 
[01:23:30]  So, yeah.  Yeah.  It's...  Apparently, sorry, apparently Walker's gained like 40, 50 pounds.  Like, he's a fat fucker now, playing in Boise.  Yeah.  He misses flight.  Enough with Boise.  You win Boise.  Exactly.  You mentioned Boise eight times already.  We get it, Boise, Boise, Boise, Boise, Boise, Boise.  I'm Canadian, and I, I don't know, I'm a shithole.  All right, Mike, thank you.  All right, man.  A lot of Asians in Toronto, Mike. 
[01:24:00]  A lot of Asians.  When Lynn Sadie made it to Toronto, the Asians came out.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I know.  Same with when Ichiro plays against the Jays.  But does anyone know why...  That's really racist, dude.  Just call them Jewish Americans.  Does anyone know why the Asians decided to settle in Toronto?  Because there are a lot of Asians up there, Ed.  Yeah, I noticed when I went into the strip club and they showed pictures of regular American girls.  He just talks over me.  I know.  It's one of those, you think he's on fucking, you think he's on a satellite remote from fucking Tel Aviv? 
[01:24:30]  He's still doing it.  There was a shortage of corner stores here.  I can't do this anymore.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, guys, I'm going to go.  All right, yeah, yeah.  Believe me, not by your choice, you're going to go.  This is the question I want to answer today.  Why did the Asians settle in Toronto?  To cross the street on the other side.  Did they get a good deal?  What's up?  I have no idea.  Is that a place they settled?  They retired there, a lot of them.  Settle down.  Could you ask Jeeves? 
[01:25:00]  Ask Jeeves.  Do people still ask Jeeves?  Jeeves never got anything right.  Jeeves sucks.  Jeeves never knows anything.  Ask Jeeves something and watch it fuck him.  Jeeves is a twat.  Why are there so many?  I wouldn't have said Asians.  I would have went with the word.  What word?  I heard Jeeves might be a little racist.  Okay.  Jeeves.  Oh, because if you don't type it in that way, because then he'll just say, because their  armor is not what it's supposed to be.  I had a conversation with Mad Dog, because he brought in his little son yesterday. 
[01:25:30]  Ah!  To meet Jack, his nine-year-old son, is adorable.  Did he meet Jack?  Oh, yeah.  And I asked him about Linsanity, and he says that Jeremy Lin is not as good as the hype,  which I now agree with.  Mm-hmm.  Pains me to say that.  But he's a good point guard.  But now he's going to be fighting for the starting point guard position with the Knicks.  Oh!  With his Byron Davis guy. 
[01:26:00]  Oh!  I hope they sit him on the bench.  But he's still a good player.  You hope they sit Lin?  I hope they sit him on the bench.  Bench.  We'll show everybody what happens when you get carried away too fast.  Put him on the bench.  Bench.  And his thoughts on Tebow.  He says a horrible move for the Jets.  He says this is a Woody Johnson move.  Woody Johnson, you know, he owns the Jets.  Big ego.  Yeah.  And he fucking is sick over the fact that the Giants won the Super Bowl. 
[01:26:30]  Well, that would be something.  So he wanted to grab the fucking headlines away from the Giants.  And he said, this is how you do it.  You grab the Tebow.  He does not like when he doesn't get the attention as far as football goes in this town.  Well, he got it.  But Eli comes out today and goes,  I just want to remind everyone who the fuck has the ring right now.  Oh, shit.  That's what Eli had to say.  Because I'm serious.  The Giants and Jets do this all the time.  They get pissed off at each other when the other team's getting all the headlines. 
[01:27:00]  So now Eli came out today like, oh, really?  Let's not forget who's got the fucking ring.  Good for him.  That's what he said.  I reckon.  And he said it just like that today, too.  There were a lot of fucks in there.  Good for him.  So, in other celebrity news, we're in our celebrity news segment, Sam.  Oh, good.  We got Alicia Silverstone.  Alicia Silverstone.  Silverstone.  Yes.  I heard she's a big time vegan.  Oh, is she a vegan of the ass?  She's a vegan and all that shit. 
[01:27:30]  She would be so fucking annoying to have to take out to dinner.  But worth it.  I can't eat that.  Yeah, you think so?  But worth it, dude.  She's adorable, yeah.  With her half-stroke mouth?  You like that?  I think she's so pretty, man.  You know what?  In Clueless, she looked really good.  In those Aerosmith videos of yesteryear, she looked very good.  Now she's looking a little haggard.  She's older.  And a little plump.  Let me see what she looks like, Sam.  I know.  Turn it, Sam.  You're not watching TV at home.  Sam, that's not how she looks now.  Let the stars see it.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, she's not bad.  No, she's not bad. 
[01:28:00]  How old is she?  I understand.  She's 82.  I wouldn't mind pumping jizz right into that womb.  Oh.  I would guess she's 30.  Ive.  37.  Ive.  Oh, I ran it to Ira in the bathroom.  I go, hey, Ira.  Oh.  I go, when are you going to do the Opie and Anthony show again?  And I swear to God, he looks at me and goes, never.  You can totally picture him doing that.  Never.  He's a classic.  Never.  He's a classic. 
[01:28:30]  He goes, I'm on the Jay Thomas show.  Show.  They don't let me talk to anyone else.  Jay Thomas, biggest prick that works here.  Yeah.  Biggest prick.  And there are some pricks that fucking walk these halls.  You're crazy to even say that.  Why?  Oh, who's a bigger prick?  Oh, yeah.  I got it.  I got a guy.  Okay.  I would put Alex Bennett on that list.  Let's do this today.  Let's fucking air this shit out.  Oh, look.  They're going into shade, shade.  Alex Bennett is a fucking prick. 
[01:29:00]  Jay Thomas is a prick.  The Al Q guys are fine.  They're all right.  Shady?  Shady's all right.  I just saw a shady guy walk in there with a hoodie on.  They're hooding up today.  Are they?  Yeah.  You notice that?  The fuck, man.  They're hooding up today.  The shady guys are fine.  Morning mashup I don't like at all.  I just think that they're fucking.  Nicole's always running down the halls.  Stanley's always fist bumping.  It's just a dangerous environment.  I don't care for them.  I just get pissed off because I don't know what they do. 
[01:29:30]  They play the hits.  Dude, we've been on the air for an hour.  I've seen them walk by four times.  It really is all they do.  I'm going to start hitting the bell every time they walk by.  What do you guys do there?  Oh, we just make sure the hallways have people in them.  That's funny.  All right, listen.  Everyone's got to put a name on the prick list.  I did, too.  I don't.  Got to put one on.  Prick works in this building.  All right, put me on the list because they're thinking it.  Oh, Jesus.  Just do it.  Let's get it out of the way.  Okay.  A prick.  I would have went with Alex, to be honest with you. 
[01:30:00]  He's a dick.  He's the one I...  He's still, like, passive aggressive.  Yeah.  He fucking won't move if he's near the bathroom and you're trying to get out.  I'm like, really?  You really want to do this?  What I don't like about him is that he attacked us first and then got upset about it.  That's the only thing I don't like about him.  I don't know his show.  I just don't like him because he attacked us unprovoked.  I haven't heard him in years, and I will say this.  I like this show.  I used to get to hear some shows every once in a while.  When he was in San Francisco with the live audience and all that shit, he was all right. 
[01:30:30]  He was all right.  I had no problems with the guy, but you're right, Jimmy.  He went after us, like, day one.  I'm like, I don't even know you.  And then we hit back very hard, and he went to management and complained.  And that's what bothers me.  Not even that he motherfucked us, but it's like, okay, we hit you back.  You attack us unwarranted, and then we attack you back hard, and you go to management.  Like, what the fuck is that?  People don't like when we get back at that.  That's what drives me fucking nuts.  I hate it.  But despair.  So I would put him on my list until he apologizes. 
[01:31:00]  Never.  He looked at me.  I'm like, how did Jay get to you?  Jay got to him.  Oh, that's so fucking funny.  I'm thinking some kind of electrode shit.  They did mind control.  I want to see if he had that scar on his fucking...  Yeah.  Cut out his brain, you bloody baboons.  Never.  I'm like, okay, then.  Antoine Walker had to sell his championship ring to raise money.  That's gotta be...  I hate when the athletes have to do that shit. 
[01:31:30]  That's gotta be a tough moment right there when you gotta do that.  When Dr. J basically admitted he had money problems, that really depressed the shit out of me.  Because he is considered one of the greatest players of all time.  Although he didn't have the contracts.  Like, he had big contracts, but he never got an Iverson contract.  How you're broke if you had a contract after 1989, it's fucking mind-boggling.  If you played in the 70s...  Of course.  I get that, because you probably made, you know, $250,000 a year, $300,000 a year.  But these guys that make...  If you made $150 million and you're broke, you should fucking kick a chair out from underneath you, 
[01:32:00]  because you are a dumb motherfucker.  Take the brook's way out.  Yeah, you really are a dope.  Are we done with the prick list?  I don't know.  Yeah, you know, I just realized I just get along with everybody.  That's good.  That's good.  Here, put this one.  I don't want to get myself in trouble.  Good for you.  Just put this one.  Put him in him.  I see that as a boring way to go through life myself.  But good for you.  Put him in him.  No, not Opie.  Him and him.  Him and him.  Who, Jimmy?  I won't blow up your spot, because it's obvious you don't want to say the actual name. 
[01:32:30]  Can you write down?  I'll just say.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's fucking brave.  Damn.  Him and him.  No.  Him and him.  Him and him.  Him and him.  Why the him?  Wow.  Just not pleasant.  Wow.  Smart, not friendly.  Wow.  Not friendly.  Wow, this is a blind item. 
[01:33:00]  Blind item, everyone.  Blind item, blind item.  Wow.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  That was fun.  Ah.  You just called my shit.  Yeah.  We're so not going to be here in October.  Come on, man.  That one?  See, it's a blind item.  Yeah, yeah.  So it leaves a plausible deniability.  And it gets along with everyone.  Yeah.  Breaking news.  And it loves everybody. 
[01:33:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  Nah, I'm just a funny piece of shit.  Oh.  Yeah.  No, I just, uh.  Not caring about anyone isn't the same as getting along with everyone.  All right.  You bring up a good point.  What's your name?  What is the Silverstone thing about?  Oh, right, right.  She's a vegan.  So she chews her food and spits it in her kid's mouth?  Like a bird.  Yeah.  That is, uh.  So she's chewing up this vegan concoction of fucking horrible shit.  Is she doing this because no one has paid attention to her in years?  Yeah.  Or is this a real thing? 
[01:34:00]  Why'd she have to make a video of it?  Uh, I don't know.  It's online.  Can you put the video on, uh.  And it's in portrait mode.  Our Facebook page.  The kid knows to do this, too.  Open Anthony on Facebook.  Because the kid's opening his mouth.  He knows what she's doing.  She does this all the time.  This isn't a goof.  Why?  The kid's opening up his mouth like a baby bird.  But then.  All right.  That's fucking sick.  Aren't you going to get older and you're going to have visions of fucking French kissing  your mom?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Why would you waste it on food?  She's dumb.  Oh.  So hard to get them to look up like that. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  She's got flax seed in there, I bet.  Plenty of flax seed.  That's just creepy.  It's fucking creepy.  It is.  It's trying to be.  People in Hollywood try so hard to be new age or different.  It's like you think there's something wrong with the way people feed their kids.  Well, check out the next video.  It's her feeding her dog peanut butter.  Vaginally.  Oh.  Whoops.  What?  Nothing.  It was like, yeah, that's it. 
[01:35:00]  I know.  I just want to have her at home.  I just want to hit it out of the park for you.  Fuck this vagary.  Vagary?  Hey, why does she do that?  Because if she's like a hardcore vegan, that food is soft to begin with, isn't it, Ant?  Oh, it's just all shit.  Isn't it?  Tofu?  You went out with a vegan a little bit, right?  No, vegetarian.  Vegetarian's different?  Okay.  Which kind of makes me a vegetarian.  Pulp Fiction.  Fuck, I didn't know that one.  But yeah, it's such a pain in the ass to go out with those fucking people. 
[01:35:30]  Because it's just, oh, I want to go to this restaurant.  It's a nice steak place.  Oh, I don't, oh, did I have some, I don't know.  I'm sure they'll make you some noodles or some fucking cheesy bread dish that you want to fucking have.  And you know, we all try every once in a while, not all I guess, but every once in a while I'll try to like knock down my meat or something, have a little more fish.  Sure.  Maybe a little chicken.  Nothing makes you feel as good as eating a steak. 
[01:36:00]  The next day you feel like a fucking animal.  With all that proteins in you.  It's great.  You feel like a fucking man that could conquer the world.  Nothing, I don't need anything with a face or a family.  Nothing with a face or a family.  What's family?  I don't know.  Do fish have families?  They barely have faces.  Yeah.  They barely have faces.  They barely have faces, let's be honest.  But that's what they say.  That's just their excuse to eat plants.  Yes.  Because fucking plants can't make noise.  You know what?  Take a time lapse fucking video of a flower in the moving sunlight. 
[01:36:30]  The fucking thing looks at the sun the whole time.  First of all, how does it know?  Secondly, what does it move?  It doesn't have muscles.  How the fuck does a plant move?  I'm boggled by that.  And I'm Professor Anthony.  Photosynthesis.  I know the photosynthesis thing with the sun actually feeding the plant.  But how does a plant move without any kind of muscles?  Fucking awful. 
[01:37:00]  It's little fibers.  Good, now I'm going to say it a hundred times.  Please do.  Do its little stem fibers expand and contract to move it around?  Because that fucking thing will track the sun like a satellite dish.  And it knows.  That, to me, is some kind of purpose or some kind of thing that a vegan is...  I guess they don't want to starve.  What bothers me is how we look at the universe is how humans look at the universe, right?  So we just assume a lot of shit.  What if you just went with what the universe thinks, which we'll never get to, obviously. 
[01:37:30]  And maybe the fucking plants are the most important thing.  Most important.  And we just fucking mow them down every day and eat them and don't give a shit?  Yeah.  Who knows?  They could be king of this planet.  We don't know.  So it's pretty pompous to just assume a lot.  The flower uses a...  Senses light.  I know it senses the light and everything.  I want to know how it moves.  I know it senses light.  The plant doesn't bend.  It grows more on one side, so in effect it bends. 
[01:38:00]  That means it's bending.  Wait a minute.  That's pretty fucking cool.  What do you mean?  All right.  All right.  So the sun is hitting it.  And then in order to keep tabs on the sun, it'll grow a little in one direction, so the  whole thing leans over a little.  Is that how a plant moves?  That's bending.  That's fucked up.  That's bending, I think.  By the way, plants, they don't have voices.  Cool.  But do you know what a plant would say if it could talk?  What?  There's bees on my head! 
[01:38:30]  Swat them!  Help!  There's a bee on my head!  All day long, he's just yelling that.  Help!  There's a bee walking on my head!  It's going to sting me!  We just abuse plants, you know what?  Dogs just pee on their heads.  They don't give a fuck.  Well, then the lawnmower starts out.  Oh, my God.  It's like, oh, okay, it is coming!  Well, that's cool.  I learned something.  Silverstone shits in a bucket, too.  Is that true?  I hope so. 
[01:39:00]  What?  And why is she chewing up the food for a kid?  What's her answer?  I guess she feels that flushing the toilet is wasteful.  Oh, it probably is.  She just says that he likes it, and he's liked it ever since he was a baby.  He might be.  And now he's like one year old, and he grabs for her mouth.  Yeah, I like it.  I'm sure if you blew your kid right out of the womb, he would end up liking it, too.  Sure, he does.  I want to go over to her house.  It doesn't mean it's right.  I want to go over to her house, take the kid, and put him in a cabinet, and dress my cock up like the kid.  And just sit there in the high chair and wait for her to feed it. 
[01:39:30]  And you just shove my cock head in her mouth.  I understood it.  But why would you be right behind?  Wouldn't that creep her out that there was somebody right behind her kid?  Because you're behind the cock head.  No, she loves the kid so much, she's just impervious.  She doesn't even...  Dress herself up like a wolf?  Yeah, she doesn't even realize that I'm in the room.  She's just feeding my cock.  That's what...  You wouldn't turn you off, though.  Just vomiting on the fucking dick.  She'd be spitting kale on your dick.  Who wants it?  Kale and flaxseed.  Kale's a little rough.  I've tried. 
[01:40:00]  Kale's navy.  So when is she going to stop doing this with her kid?  No.  Oh, God.  She's a weirdo.  College.  She goes to visit the kid in college and just goes to fucking lunch.  Goes to the cafeteria and just does some vomiting in his mouth.  What a creep.  Jen in Rhode Island says, plants do have feelings.  I saw it on TV.  Oh, is that when they hooked the electrodes up to it?  You don't know if that's feelings.  Why?  They hooked the electrodes up, some kind of electrodes,  and put it through some kind of amplifier and then through a speaker. 
[01:40:30]  And then it screamed when they cut it.  It was like...  But it wasn't the sound of the plant.  It's the sound of whatever machine you have it hooked up to.  And then the reaction, the electronic reaction you're getting from cutting the plant  is something different than pain.  But they always want to say, you know, you're hurting plants.  What are we supposed to eat, motherfuckers?  What the fuck are we supposed to eat?  Each other?  Huh?  Ass?  We got to get ours.  Yeah.  I gots to get mines. 
[01:41:00]  Carnivore got to eat.  Yo.  Omnivore, actually, right?  Aren't we omnivores?  Omnivorous?  Yeah.  We eat both.  My kid's trying to push my nipples into my body.  He doesn't like them?  I don't know.  Whoa.  Do you have big nipples?  I didn't think so, but they do get, like, hard a lot.  Do they get puffy?  No, they don't get puffy, but they get, like...  See, I would be like, stop that!  Knock it off.  I'd yell at the kid, like, stop!  And when you have a kid, you do dumb things where you go, like, where's your boo-boo? 
[01:41:30]  And, you know, he gets a boo-boo and he'll point to it.  So then I'll go, where's daddy's boo-boo?  And he'll point at my gut.  Oh, shit.  That's my boo-boo.  Oh, man.  That's the nicest part of your body.  I so understand parents that hit their kids.  He's just being a little smart-ass.  They're a little too...  No, they're a little too honest.  Yeah.  I spent the other day, like, for five minutes trying to push my nipples back into my body.  I guess he doesn't like how they look.  I can only imagine what my dad would have done if I tried to do that. 
[01:42:00]  Stock it off, you faggot!  What, you faggot?  Yeah, dad.  Faggot.  Did your dad used to ask you, where's your boo-boo?  I don't remember any of that, like, childish, like, oh, where's your boo-boo?  Yeah.  I remember...  Eh, what are you doing?  Walk it off.  Eh, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Be a man.  Be a man.  Meh.  I should have just went gay.  If I went gay, it would have just fucking really pissed him off.  If only I loved the cock as much as, you know...  Life's regrets. 
[01:42:30]  Life's regrets.  Life's regrets.  Yeah.  If only you loved the cock, well, you at least liked it.  So what?  You didn't love it.  You don't love this show, but you do it.  So you might as well, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe you didn't love cock, but you certainly had a passing affection for it.  I never had a penchant for cock.  Like my own.  Well, I love my own cock.  Well, I want to jerk my cock. 
[01:43:00]  Well, I want to squeeze my ball with you.  With Troy Kwan.  Hey, is Troy plus one for your wedding, Sam?  Uh, yeah.  Is he bringing Troy Kwan?  That's what I mean.  Is he a pompous enough to think he's two people for your wedding?  Troy Kwan plus me.  Yeah, he's ordering two meals for himself.  Of course he is. 
[01:43:30]  Let's break.  I think we did great with Celebrity News.  That was a terrific segment.  You guys did really well.  That was a strong Celebrity News segment.  Yeah.  Lady Gaga is 26 today.  Happy birthday.  26?  To that pig.  Oh.  It's her birthday.  Her stupid fucking parents wouldn't let me in a restaurant because we didn't have a reservation  for three, even though the place was half empty.  What the hell is that about?  They didn't want to seat my kid.  So fuck Lady Gaga and fuck her parents.  Oh. 
[01:44:00]  That's a bold statement.  New restaurant in Manhattan.  Really?  Why would you want people to come in?  Especially somebody that might talk it up on the air the next day.  Yeah.  Their pomp isn't too cool for the room restaurant owners.  Do they have Lady Gaga, remember, hanging up?  No.  No?  I heard the Calama.  The Calama.  You could bounce off the walls.  Rubbery?  That's one of the reviews that came in for that joint.  Oh, boy.  See, this is what you do.  So you should treat everyone nice because you never know who you're fucking with.  But what if there was reservations for people and they would have had to bump somebody?  There was no one there. 
[01:44:30]  What if they were all coming?  Sometimes they go, we...  It's a stampede?  We don't take walk-ins if you're three.  Three years old?  Three peeps.  Oh, that's different.  I do.  A bunch of toddlers walking in.  They're all pissed.  That's exactly what they said.  Storming out of the place, cursing.  And I think it might have been Lady Gaga's mom herself that said that.  Mrs. Gaga?  Because she looked a little funny like Lady Gaga does.  Madam Gaga.  Did you get a picture?  Yeah.  Why would I get a picture with that?  Madonna's kid is smoking. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Now, that could be a couple of things.  She's actually doing something that is bad for her health.  Or she's hot.  Or she's very hot.  See?  I think it's...  Because that could be a news story, right?  Oh, why is Madge's kid smoking cigarettes?  But no, she's smoking hot, right?  She's...  She went through a funny, fucked up phase.  And then she's starting to look pretty...  Yeah, that phase right there.  With fucking...  Fucking...  I'll be honest.  ...eybrows.  I'll be honest.  This is more your world, but she's... 
[01:45:30]  More my world.  But she's definitely looking pretty fucking hot for 15 years old.  Let me take a look.  Oh, 15?  Well...  You gotta see the latest one where she has the cigarette and the sunglasses on.  Let's see.  Oh, she is smoking cigarettes.  Yeah, what do you think I said?  I thought smoking hot.  There you go.  Oh, damn.  All right.  Let's see.  That's a pretty hot picture.  Yeah, motherfucker.  If you looked at that, you would definitely say she's older than 15.  Yeah, that's what...  You tell the judge.  Oh, yeah.  Is that acting out, you think?  Or just being a teenager?  She looks like a teen holding the cigarette, though, in the photo to the right. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Kids don't know how to hold cigarettes cool.  Yeah.  You think you look cool.  You look silly.  You gotta learn how to hold it.  That looks...  Oh, that's a pen.  Does she have any talent?  She's a fashion designer.  Let's see that one.  Oh, man.  Yeah, come on.  That ain't bad.  Look at her.  She's got some baby fat on her.  She's kind of cute.  Yeah.  How old is she?  She's young, right?  15.  Wow.  Young girl, get out of my...  What?  That horrible tetaphyl song. 
[01:46:30]  Well, I want to fuck Madonna's order.  Well, I don't want to go to jail.  Well, she's wearing Traquan sunglasses.  Right?  Let me take a break.  I got an answer to the Chinese thing.  Oh?  Chinese immigrants went to Canada.  Thank you, Jen Young, 1989.  Jen Young.  So she might know what she's talking about here.  Oh, Young?  Young.  Young? 
[01:47:00]  That could be anything.  Chinese immigrants went to Canada to help build Transcontinental Railroad in the 1800s.  They did that here, though, too, dummy.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  After the railroad's built, why would you stay in a cold climate?  Dumb.  Yeah.  Dumb culture.  And what did they leave?  Thank you.  What did they leave here?  You know?  I think so.  Maybe they took the train.  Well, they went to San Francisco.  A lot of them settled in San Francisco.  And then after the NAMM...  Do we have a San Francisco song, you know?  Oh.  We built this city.  My dick's all shitting! 
[01:47:30]  My dick's all shitting from your ass.  My dick's all shitting!  This fucking guy sells it!  My dick's all shitting from your ass.  My dick's all shitting!  This was stuck in my head.  Fuck it.  Let's go to break.  Yeah.  Play this out.  Yeah.  Say you won't blow me 
[01:48:00]  Like it in your face  Say you only take the cock  In your dirty face  Now I'm all filthy  There's duty on my dick  It looks just like a black man's  But not quite as thick 
[01:48:30]  Your coolie needs a diaper  Cause I'm in your cold and cold  Got a dirty hand  And my dick's all shitty  My dick's all shitty  From your ass hole  My dick's all shitty  My dick's all shitty  From your ass hole  My dick's all shitty 
[01:49:00]  My dick's all shitty  from your ass hole. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, well, well.  All right, so the Gorilla Bob writes on the Twitter, China allows its citizens to emigrate.  He writes emigrate.  Emigrate, yes.  Emigrate?  Emigrate.  Why is it emigrate?  One's leaving, one's coming.  But wouldn't they be emigrating?  Oh, emigrate, so they're leaving their country.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  One's going one way, one's going the other.  Yeah, I fucking board of patrols in the middle going, what do you want for me? 
[01:50:00]  I can't just be emigrated both ways there.  Immigrate.  Why not?  Hey, emigrate, and emma pretty good.  No?  Why not just call it emigrate for both?  Yeah.  And then it's one less word we have to worry about.  We have to worry about too many words.  A lot of words in this here language.  China allows its citizens to emigrate to very few places.  Montreal is allowed.  And Toronto is allowed.  So a lot of Chinese people go through those two cities, and then they spread out from there. 
[01:50:30]  But a lot of people say, you know what?  Fuck it.  Let's just stay right the fuck here.  Oh, is that it?  I'm thinking that might be the real answer now.  Okay.  Good enough.  I'll buy that for a dollar.  DJ Paulie D will be in the ya-ha-ya-ya-ya.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to be in the ha-ya-ya-ya.  He's got his own show coming up or something?  Wasn't he supposed to spin for us, Sam, or something?  Oh, yeah, he was.  Yeah.  What the fuck is he coming back without his turntables?  He's a big star now.  He's on G-Unit Records.  Hookid was telling everybody that 50 Cent fired him, but Hookid makes up bullshit all the time. 
[01:51:00]  Uh, yeah, he's signed with 50 Cent's label.  Yeah.  You know, I heard a 50 Cent, and I like to say 50, Cent song that I was really into.  What song?  Cocaine.  You know that song?  No, not yet.  Fucking heard it, and I was like, I don't like the cocaine, but I like this song.  Yeah?  Yeah!  Want to hear it?  Sure.  We can do anything on this show.  I like hearing a little bit.  Is this it?  Where'd you get this stuff? 
[01:51:30]  I don't know.  Cocaine War?  Cocaine War?  Oh, uh, do you mind if I do a line?  Yeah, go ahead.  It's just, fuck it, let's all do one.  What are they, doing an 80s video?  Yeah, what the fuck, it's one of the 80s videos.  Hip-hop loves intros.  They love the, uh, dramatic skits on albums.  It started with California Love.  Remember that big fucking name?  California.  Great song.  I mean, I can touch it, but I can't feel it inside.  Oh, you're motherfucking right. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, you're motherfucking right.  He's glorifying drugs and gunfire.  That's right.  I don't appreciate that at all.  Ooh, it makes fun to dance to, though. 
[01:52:30]  Who's rapping?  50.  Oh, boy.  It's all right.  You like your dance?  Yeah.  It's a little chill.  I, I, I don't fucking, this does nothing.  Justin Bieber's new song, he raps it.  Have you heard fucking Boyfriend?  I know.  Oh, oh.  Bieber rap?  Yeah.  Share a little Bieber rap.  And by the way, uh, Mark Zito from Ron and Fez.  Did you say by the way?  By the way.  Boy the way.  Boy the way.  Boy the way.  Boy the way.  Boy the way.  Mark Zito from Ron and Fez has confirmed this a hit.  He likes this. 
[01:53:00]  Well, of course it's going to be a hit.  No, but like.  It doesn't mean you have to like it.  He's saying this is like a good.  So my little haven is Brooklyn.  Advertising.  Everybody is very friendly.  Is this advertising?  Before the babes.  Looking at some hipsters.  Katy Perry.  Is that what I'm saying?  Katy Perry.  Pardon me.  Is this the MTV show or no?  Katy Perry must really hate herself.  You think so?  Yeah, because she uglies herself up all the fucking time.  Can't ugly up those tits.  I know, but she's a hot broad and she throws all sorts of weird shit on her hair and her body. 
[01:53:30]  It's like, just fucking go out there as a hot broad.  If she ever fucks me, you'll know she hates herself.  That's what you should say after she fucks me.  You know how a girl hates her.  Are we really doing this boyfriend thing?  You got to hear some of it.  Oh, yeah.  It's just, it's not good.  This is the Biebs' latest song.  And it does have a weak voice.  I want to hear the rapping.  Well, the Beliebers think it's a hit and they think it's terrific.  He's trying to get to the next, you know, I don't have a child's voice anymore so I can't hit those notes.  Oh, boy.  This is entering my mature phase. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  All right.  Some of those songs when you're a kid are kind of good.  Let's, I mean, I feel like pop shit, I guess.  Catchy shit, right?  This is good.  Oh, boy.  Just things.  If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go.  I could take you places you ain't never been before.  Oh, no, be foe.  I got money in my hands that I really like to blow.  Swat, swat, swat on you.  Telling about a fire.  Fucking embarrassing.  This is good.  I don't know about me, but I know about you.  So say hello to my settle in three, two, three. 
[01:54:30]  You like this, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  I'd like to be everything you want.  Is that how you dance, Sam?  No.  What the fuck?  If I was your boyfriend, never let you go.  Keep me on my own, girl.  This is nice.  I hate it.  Then I have to ask myself, are we getting just too old? 
[01:55:00]  No, I never would have liked it.  Oh, you don't think it's good, Sam?  No.  Because in your world, you would.  Oh, wait, he's rapping again.  I want to fight, yeah, you already know.  I'm going to make you shine bright like you're laying in a snow park.  Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend.  You could be my girlfriend into the upper world.  Yes, I could dance, do a spin in a trailer.  Boy's going crazy on the sweat like a well with swaggy.  I'd like to be everything you want.  The chorus is the only redeeming part of the song.  The chorus is acceptable.  Yeah, why is he rapping so much? 
[01:55:30]  Because he can't sing.  Yeah, he's not good.  He's not a good singer.  He's not good.  The chorus is okay, but he even raps weak.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's trying to sound black.  He's putting in a black, black dialect.  Yeah.  And it's so fucking forced.  It's offensive.  He makes too much money for black people to just laugh at him in the studio, but they  couldn't enjoy this.  They're playing it on Hot 97.  They're going to be playing it everywhere.  But the reason they're playing it on Hot 97 is because he'll call in to the show, and 
[01:56:00]  then they'll pretend they like it.  For the show.  We get fucking Bobo, they get Bieber.  Right.  That's great.  Yeah.  But we don't pretend to like Bobo at all.  That's true.  Or Bieber.  Or Bieber.  What's the shelf life on the Biebs there, Sam?  The clock is ticking.  That's stepping the wrong direction.  He's not a good singer.  But his fan base will ignore all that and just fucking, you know, suck up everything  he does.  But eventually it will become like a joke.  Like it'll be, everybody will be in on the fact that he's not good anymore.  He'll have to do, like he's doing movies and fragrances.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  All that stuff.  He'll have to become a brand.  Like Diddy is a brand now.  Like he'll put out music, but he's beyond that.  But I think a shelf life in that world is even short.  I think he's got to make his money quick.  Oh, dude.  He's set for 50 lifetimes.  No, I know, but I'm saying like 10 years from now, he's not going to be endorsing products.  There's no fucking way.  He could do some movies right now.  He's not going to have the shelf life.  Yeah.  It depends on what right now.  What movies is he going to do?  I don't know if he can act or not.  Did you see him act in that short thing during the Oscars?  He was terrible.  He could do some teen movies, though.  You don't need to be a good actor to be a good actor.  Teen movies? 
[01:57:00]  He's going to become like a joke, though, for that whole thing.  Diddy is actually a good actor.  Like he did fucking A Raisin in the Sun, I think it was.  Yeah, and he did.  Yeah.  He actually has some chops.  Yeah, he can really act.  He's an asshole, but he has some chops.  Oh, I like Puff Diddy.  Get him to the Greek.  Puff Diddy.  I didn't see that.  He was kind of playing himself, but he was playing himself.  He was very funny.  I forgot about that.  That movie was almost good.  I thought it was all right.  Diddy.  It was almost good.  It was one of those almost goods.  Diddy what?  Christy Brinkley, ladies and gentlemen.  We should have added her to our celebrity news segment, because everyone's playing this clip 
[01:57:30]  today.  She had a breakdown on what?  GMA or?  Today Show.  The Today Show.  Did she?  Yeah, man.  She's 58 years old.  She's not 58.  She's 58 years old.  Holy shit.  And looking pretty good.  Fuck yeah, man.  Wow.  She's looking pretty good for 58.  I wouldn't mind.  She's just looking pretty good, I should say.  And what?  She's going through a horrendous divorce.  Yeah.  That's the guy Peter something who banged that hot young chick?  Peter Cook.  Peter Cook.  And he was banging a chick much younger and much hotter. 
[01:58:00]  Cook.  Yeah.  Well, according to Christy Brinkley, this Peter Cook's not letting this thing go.  They've been fighting this shit for four years.  Yeah.  When he was the one that, I guess, started the whole thing by banging the young brood.  Oh, boy.  That must have just slayed her.  A lot of people would say.  Slayed her.  But then again, you don't know what she did.  Of course.  That led him to do what he did.  Yeah.  Right?  Always two sides to a story.  Yeah, you know.  Or is it three sides?  What is it?  Two sides.  Now you go three sometimes. 
[01:58:30]  I just say it's my way or the highway.  Yeah.  It's his, hers, and then the truth.  That's the third story.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on moi.  You guys want to hear this or no?  I don't care.  Sure.  Sure.  I've heard it.  I've heard it already.  Christy Brinkley on the Today Show.  I had my trial like every other woman going through a divorce.  I never thought it would end up in court, but he was determined.  How can the two of you now make this better? 
[01:59:00]  For the sake of the children, for the sake of your private life and Peter's private life,  how can you make it better?  What the experts say is you need to have a no contact rule.  And I put in place my lawyer over two years ago, and I haven't had any contact with him.  But he continues to, you know, contact me.  And that's the problem.  This only makes her hotter, right?  And so I quietly ask the judge, please, make this stop.  Protect my right to peace. 
[01:59:30]  I just want peace for my family.  Justice, no peace.  Sorry.  But I just want peace.  And every time I have any joy or any kind of success in anything, he has to try to destroy it.  And the courts need to learn how to deal with this kind of situation.  I had fully intended to ask you about Chicago. 
[02:00:00]  So why don't we do this?  Since we have now run our course of time on this, why don't you come back at some point?  And we'll talk only about Chicago.  Come back when you're fucking pissy-eyed.  That's what I wanted to talk about today.  Okay?  Oh, boy.  Thank you, frankly.  Christy, thanks for your time.  Get her off the set.  Is that Matt Lauer?  He's good, though, man.  Matt Lauer's a good fucking interviewer.  Yeah?  Yes, he's ballsy.  And he's like, he fucking went, you know, he didn't back off Tom Cruise.  He's a good interviewer.  Right.  You're being glib.  He is a bit glib.  Yeah, he's fucking glib. 
[02:00:30]  I like a glib guy.  How glib are you?  I was voted glibbiest boy in town.  Two years in a row.  Most likely the glib in a pro-rambler.  Poor Christy.  I just want peace.  Is he rocking in front of a kid?  Crying.  The favorite part is that he's too hungry to even say a piece.  I just want peace.  I want peace.  I want peace. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, you rock.  Yeah.  I want to be your boyfriend.  Horrible.  I wish I was a Bieber fan just to enrage people, like, for real.  Oh, really?  Like, I wish I loved him like I love Ozzy, but it wasn't ironic.  Oh, God.  I have two Bieber songs on my iPod.  Which ones?  They were good. 
[02:01:30]  No, they weren't.  Which ones?  Which ones?  It's from when he was a kid.  He's still a kid.  Oh, Chris Rousseau.  Got to be on...  I don't know.  Hi, miss.  Dovable goods rise.  Brian, what do you got, buddy?  If you really want to hear Bieber sound like an affected black kid, watch the West Coast  Customs where they built the car for him.  There's nothing worse than seeing a bunch of grown men who build cars for a living kowtowing  to a little fucking rock star.  Oh, good. 
[02:02:00]  And what do you...  He sounds black in that?  Oh, he's...  He's like, what's up, dog?  Yeah, come see me in my studio.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He is so bad.  Oh, no.  I've seen him on TV shows when he's being interviewed.  Yeah.  Yeah, he does this whole thing where he tries to, you know, wigger it up.  Do we have footage of that, Sam, instead of futzing around?  Yeah, let's get some of that.  Futzing around, Sam.  Get some of that embarrassment.  Let me see.  Thank you, Brian.  I can't see.  You're not watching TV at home.  I've watched this West Coast Customs show. 
[02:02:30]  It's not bad.  It stinks.  These guys are good.  And build Bieber's rise.  They make some fucking cool-ass shit.  But will it hit the right note for the Prince of Pop?  Prince of Pop?  Oh, my goodness.  Ooh!  Are you serious?  That's crazy.  Catch the season finale of Inside West Coast.  It was the promo.  Yo, that's crazy.  That's crazy.  Are you serious, yo?  Hi, Doug.  Ah, man. 
[02:03:00]  What happened to him?  He used to be so genteel.  No.  He sang like a bird.  They lose it all when they get that body hair.  Yeah.  I used to pull it off with tape.  I seen a hair once on the test team.  I blink.  I plucked it out.  Oh, shit.  With my squeezes.  One single hair.  Yeah.  I used my teeth.  Oh, God.  Clink.  He went, ow.  And then he spits it out and says, don't do that no more.  Yeah, he said. 
[02:03:30]  Don't get no more of those.  Don't get no more of these.  I'll tell your parents.  So, I took a little bit of, you know.  Oh, here we go.  Special.  Yeah.  West Coast flavor.  Exactly.  So, um, they took the Cadillac CTS.  No.  And we.  Oh, my goodness.  That is crazy.  Dude, tell me it doesn't look like Batman's car.  Are you serious?  No, this is insane.  The dopest part.  It's a cool car.  Dopest part.  Push that star.  The dopest part is going to be the driver.  No.  Dope. 
[02:04:00]  Are you serious?  Favorite part.  You know, I just got here.  I love the rims, the wheels.  I love, I love the suicide doors on this thing.  This is nuts.  You know, I wanted to be something that I could roll in and be low-key, but still, you know,  be, you know, in a cool car.  Low-key?  In a car like that?  Low-key, right.  Sure.  You look like Batman driving down the freeway.  Suicide doors are stupid.  What is suicide door?  They open the wrong way.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  Why would you want the door to open that way?  No reason.  Can't even bail out.  Huh?  That's crazy.  He should have been on that jet blue plane.  That's crazy.  That pilot's crazy.  I will say one thing for Bieber.  Yeah.  He's a nice kid.  He is a nice kid.  He's not a graceless twat.  Like, he's, uh, he seems like he's a nice, uh, kid.  He seems like a very nice boy. 
[02:05:00]  Let's hear more of this.  Oh, right here.  We gotta hear this.  Mm-hmm.  Where he's talking.  Don't leave, bro.  Yo.  I am in love, man.  Yeah, I was like, yo, I want my car to be able to play good music and be able to just, like,  sound like the studio when I'm in the car.  It's wicked.  I couldn't ask for a better stereo system.  Couldn't ask for a better room if you need some luggage back here.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's all about the music.  Yeah, exactly.  It's all about packing luggage into his own car.  Insane.  I'm so happy. 
[02:05:30]  Pack condoms into the back.  What a pussy he gets.  That was a really good idea, Justin, I gotta say.  Right?  Yeah.  I mean, when you first, yes, yes, it was.  It's, uh, he's not really sounding all that black.  Yeah, fair.  It's fine.  A throw, uh.  He seems like a nice boy.  He could be a lot worse.  Yeah, but, God, I do hate watching him on interviews and stuff.  That's why I tend not to.  He's finding himself.  Is he?  Yeah, he'll get out of that. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  I went through that stage.  Yeah?  Did you find yourself?  Where about you?  Yeah.  We're still trying to find ourselves, aren't we?  Yes, we are.  We're still trying to find our voices.  I found my voice.  You did?  And it's booming.  Hi!  That was jelly.  Hey, uh, Ant, this is a gun story I want to get your opinion on.  80-year-old charged with unlawful use of a weapon for shooting a home intruder.  I read this.  What's the problem with this?  Well, it's in, uh, the fine, uh, city of Chicago.  Chicago, if I am, uh, correct here. 
[02:06:30]  And that's who's in trouble is the 80-year-old.  This fucking dumb city.  Uh, he's in his house.  Uh, guy breaks in.  Um, guy, uh, the 80-year-old guy approaches the guy that broke in.  Uh, he's not backing off.  The guy doesn't leave his house.  The 80-year-old guy shoots him.  I think he hit him in the leg.  Okay.  And, uh, the cops come and arrest both of them.  And arrested the 80-year-old for, um, unlawful use of a firearm.  Was the guy in his house? 
[02:07:00]  Unlawful possession.  Uh, yeah.  Guy was in his house.  Uh, yeah.  See, you're not allowed to have a gun.  You're not allowed to have one in Chicago.  It's like they're, they're still working through this, um, lawsuit that's going on.  So he has an illegal gun?  Yeah.  But he's using it to protect himself?  Protect himself.  Wow.  He could have just been a dead guy.  He could have just been dead 80-year-old guy in his, uh, apartment.  But he defended himself, as you are due in the Constitution.  And, uh, he finds himself, um, now in jail.  Uh, and now he's facing charges, uh, after shooting a burglar. 
[02:07:30]  Uh, I don't think he's gonna see any time.  I think he'll get off on this.  But, he shouldn't have been arrested in the first place.  Well, illegal.  Yeah, but, uh, that's what I mean.  The law's gotta be changed.  You gotta allow, uh, law-abiding citizens to, to defend themselves.  Absolutely.  To be able to, uh, uh, have the same things that the bad guys have.  I mean, it's crazy.  How many, uh, places don't allow you to have a gun?  There are a few cities. 
[02:08:00]  They're working on it, though.  There's a lot of lawsuits pending right now.  Would he have been allowed to have a, uh, shotgun?  Um, I, maybe.  I'm not sure.  I think so, yeah.  I think it's handguns or, uh, verboten.  But, uh, yeah, a lot of cities, though, are so restrictive that you, you know, even though  they say you're, you're able to get one, you can't.  Um, and it's just, it's, it's against, uh, the Constitution.  It's, you know, you could, you could call me an asshole.  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And they, most people do.  Sure.  But.  Gee.  I couldn't wait to say that. 
[02:08:30]  I know.  But you gotta adhere to the laws of the land.  And, uh, the Second Amendment says that, you know, your, your right to bear arms shall  not be infringed upon.  And it is being infringed upon in so many places.  So, I'm sure that I'm really surprising you with this, uh, take on this story.  No, I agree with you, actually.  You're right.  You got someone coming in your fucking home.  You gotta do the right thing and fucking blow his head off.  Exactly.  I'm in the leg. 
[02:09:00]  I don't care if you have a tank in your house.  Whatever you gotta take to defend your house.  Yeah.  Uh, speaking of, uh, tank, his nickname is Tank.  We're talking about Homer Tank Wright.  Homer Tank Wright?  That's right.  Is that the 80-year-old?  That's right.  Wow.  I was joking.  I know.  You don't fuck around with Tank.  Yes, I have a tank left, too.  Tank for the memories.  And, uh, going to the Windy City right now.  Yes.  Tommy in the Windy City. 
[02:09:30]  Tommy.  What's going on, guys?  It's pretty windy.  It's pretty windy.  He's playing along.  All right.  Yeah.  You just did a Pat from Minocchi right there.  Pretty windy.  Couldn't be any windier.  Where's Pat?  Come in and see us, Pat.  The guy, it's not necessarily illegal to own a gun in the city anymore because the lawsuit  got held up.  Yeah.  Because the city originally didn't allow anyone to own a handgun in the city of Chicago. 
[02:10:00]  Yep.  But then they rendered that unconstitutional.  The problem with this guy, not that I agree with it, is that he was a convicted felon from  like 20 years ago or 15 years ago.  Oh.  Which renders him elite, which renders him unable to own a gun.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  So that's the argument for the police, is that he's not supposed to have a gun.  Whoops.  I guess they have to arrest him under those circumstances.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, they have to.  But God, it sucks to be that guy.  He's just minding his own business.  And all of a sudden, his wife is being woken up by a 19-year-old burglar that went through  some plywood, right? 
[02:10:30]  Illinois is the only state that doesn't allow any sort of concealed carry law in the whole  United States.  And it actually got passed last year by 60 to 40 for votes, but it has to get passed  by 71% because the stupid idiots downstate want it to get passed.  Oh, bullshit.  Because it violates home rule.  No, it doesn't.  It's not true.  All right.  What the fuck, dude? 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Punch out.  Yeah, thanks for nothing, asshole.  I'm just kidding.  He's probably 100% right.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy's so mean.  For no reason.  None.  It was a great call.  He made some good points.  I was quiet for a while.  He's like, what is Jimmy being?  Oh, okay.  What did I do?  It's like, what the fuck?  What did I do? 
[02:11:30]  Yay.  I'm so happy that worked out.  Okay.  Listen.  Those are tough ones to get to work.  Listen.  Yesterday, there was a story.  Unfortunately, I don't have it in front of me because I want to know more about this.  New York City bans dinosaurs, Halloween, birthdays, and other things.  Yeah.  And they're SAT questions, right?  From school tests.  Now, what's the reason for this?  What's the problem with dinosaurs?  They offend certain religious people.  Because too many people believe Jesus wrote a dinosaur?  Or they believe that the earth is only 6,000 years old and it was never. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  What was the Ricky Gervais thing yesterday that made me howl about making fun of the people?  Oh, yeah.  Creationists.  Saying, what, the world's either 55,000 years old?  Or 4.5 billion.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he kind of like weighs it with his hands and goes, meh.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Oh, that's right.  Scientists.  Scientists.  What a great lie.  He does get into some brawls on Twitter with the people about that.  Centaur believes in the dinosaur Jesus thing?  He must.  Right?  And he's that close to being president.  But so does Ron Paul.  He's not going to be our president, thank God.  But he's that close. 
[02:12:30]  Ron Paul believes in that?  Yes, that's the weird thing.  Fuck!  Run!  But it doesn't matter.  That's why I like him.  I think that's an asshole view to have.  But I like the fact that he's so liberal and so conservative.  He's so all over the place.  That he's not trying to...  That makes him a complete person.  This earth's been around for so fucking long and I completely believe a shit...  Yeah, 5,000 years.  I believe a shitload of civilizations have come and gone.  Know who else believes that?  Black Earl.  Oh, he doesn't.  Black Earl believes 5,000 years. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, black Earl believes...  That's a stupid asshole.  Believes that people, yeah, people are playing fetch with the velociraptors.  Keep taking your dumb pictures in New York City and leave this shit to us.  You know what?  I do have a certain belief in this too.  But I do believe that cavemen rode on the backs of Brontosaurus and worked in the quarries with them.  And when the whistle would blow to get off of work, they actually, and this is proven, science proved this, would slide down the tail. 
[02:13:30]  And you know how they end curls?  Yeah.  They would get air, like lift, and right into a car that they used their feet to propel and then would drive home that way.  Wow!  Yeah, but you're forgetting something.  When they slid down in the back of the Brontosaurus, because they were all wearing these, like, skirt dresses, how come their little outfit didn't hike up and their balls and assholes scrape against the rough skin of the dinosaur?  That would hurt. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Dinosaur scales rubbing against your ball bag?  That's why when you see pictures of dinosaurs' photos, they all have, like, a little bit of red and brown on the back of their tail.  That wasn't put there by nature.  Oh, I thought it was the natural color.  No, no, that was people's colons and hemorrhoids being ripped apart by their rough, fucking long dinosaur tails.  And they learned once, don't do that on a stegosaurus back.  Oh, right.  You lose your balls.  Wow, yeah.  Right at the end of that ride.  What's the school story there?  Just SAT questions because it pisses off some religions? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  And also other stuff for people.  Where is my kid going to go to school?  Because I'm not going to allow him to learn this.  Send him private.  This bullshit.  Send him private.  I'm not going to allow this bullshit.  So where do parents like me take their kid?  Homeschooling.  Yes.  I'm serious.  Is there a place?  Private school.  I want my kid to be able to celebrate Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, Halloween, all that shit.  Send him to Hogwarts.  Christmas shit, not fucking winter festivals. 
[02:15:00]  Valentine's Day.  Yeah, you're right.  All that.  All that good shit.  All those good white people holidays.  Yeah, man.  Right?  Being a parent has opened up my eyes.  I can't imagine the parents out there having to deal with this crap when their kids come  home with this nonsense.  Yeah.  What's the story, Sam?  I haven't read all of it.  Oh, boy.  Well, how about you, Dave?  What do you got to do?  I don't because it's from yesterday.  That's why I'm stuck here.  Fucking reading challenge to something?  Yeah, I mean, I'm reading to you.  Why don't you go to Sylvan?  No, just the base.  Fucking retard. 
[02:15:30]  Look.  Look.  In an effort to eliminate potential, quote, unpleasant emotions among students, the New  York Department of Education has placed a ban on mentions of birthdays, dinosaurs, Halloween,  and dancing in city-issued tests.  Because it will offend religious people.  Why birthdays?  Because the Jehovah's Witnesses don't celebrate them.  Oh, boy.  That's how crazy this is getting?  Yeah.  It's fucking sickening.  Well, because you can't say, all right, we won't mention dinosaurs, because then the 
[02:16:00]  Jehovah's Witnesses will say, well, if you make an exception for that, you have to make  an exception.  So now you have to ban everything.  But that's, again, sanitized shit.  You know, how about those people, if they don't like it, they go find another school for  their kids instead of, I have to now find a school for my kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, that actually plays a lot.  Because the majority of the parents and the majority of the students don't give a fuck.  No.  So why are we always catering to the minority?  Why?  To one or two people.  Well, I'm very upset my daughter has to be in this school with a birthday party going  on.  Shut up.  It's gotten that crazy. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Yep.  Deal with it.  The majority doesn't give a fuck.  What happened to the majority rules?  Yeah.  What happened to that in this country?  Because they don't fight back.  People just, again, it's the small groups that have the fucking, the groupings and the  emails.  So they write, and there's not five million other people writing back going, if you do this,  we'll spit on you.  So all they're hearing is that fucking, that offended voice.  And we all remember that one kid that couldn't do the Pledge of Allegiance and had to leave  and he looked all awkward and stupid.  Fuck him.  She just hated parents. 
[02:17:00]  That was one person.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it is going off the parents.  They're the ones that fucking do that shit.  Oh my God.  You think the kid doesn't want to be in there during a party?  I remember parties in the classroom.  They don't have those anymore.  Guess what?  What about the kid?  You're not allowed to do that.  What about, well, we, every other day was a party in grammar school, remember?  That was great.  And what about the kids that didn't get to celebrate their birthday during the school year?  We didn't look at those kids differently.  No, that's true too, yeah.  What about those poor saps that had their birthdays in the summer? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's probably why also.  No birthdays, because, you know, some kids have it in the summer and they don't get to have a party in school.  So what?  Luck of the draw, fucker.  And no, it comes down to, once again, lazy parenting.  Yep.  Lazy parenting.  Yeah.  A, you shouldn't allow it, and B, if, unfortunately, your kid falls into one of these categories, as a parent, you fucking talk it out with them.  Everyone's got their shit.  So they're saying dinosaurs could bring up evolution. 
[02:18:00]  Halloween could suggest paganism and birthdays might create animosity for students who are Jehovah's Witnesses.  Because the word poverty is also not allowed, as words that suggest wealth might cause some students to feel excluded.  Who the fuck is overthinking this shit?  Liberal fuck dicks.  Because when we were growing up, we didn't think twice about this shit.  All I knew about Halloween was you put on a wacky costume, got candy.  Put on a wacky costume, got candy.  Thank you.  Yes.  That's all you thought?  You didn't think of the deeper meaning? 
[02:18:30]  Oh my God.  Am I reading this properly?  The department is also banning mentions of divorce and disease in case students have loved ones who are separated or suffering from an illness.  Sure.  Slavery is also flagged, and terrorism is considered too scary.  That's can't be true.  Is this New York City?  Doomed.  Oh yeah.  New York City schools.  Country of little twats.  Doomed.  It's from the Post.  It's in the education section.  New York City schools across the board?  City, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  Doomed.  Yeah.  This is a joke.  No.  It's a fucking joke, isn't it?  Yep.  What was that other one?  There was one in there.  That was it.  Slavery.  Slavery.  Terrorism, divorce, disease.  You can't mention divorce what?  While you're just teaching?  No.  From city, I believe all this is from city-issued tests.  So you can't say, you know, like, Johnny's parents were divorced. 
[02:19:30]  But if his mom sucks ten dicks a day.  But the next step is obviously banning teachers from saying this stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  We're so doomed.  Why are we doing this to ourselves?  Why?  We're dumb.  Why are we doing this?  They think they're making this better society, this perfect society.  I don't even know how I'm going to handle this when my kid goes to school.  I'm going to lose my fucking mind.  I'm going to lose my mind. 
[02:20:00]  This, all this shit should be fair game.  And then you fucking explain this stuff.  That's good.  Yeah, city, evolution is science.  And they don't want to mention dinosaurs.  So what are they going to teach in science class?  Well, they can't teach evolution.  Or can you?  I think what you can do is you can teach evolution.  But you have to preface it with this is a theory as is creationism.  And when I was in college, professors actually had to say we do have to say that some people believe in evolution while others believe in creationism. 
[02:20:30]  We're going to be focusing on those that believe in evolution in this class.  And then they continue to teach.  And the college doesn't have to say that.  No, but they did in Syracuse.  Obviously, that was Syracuse's policy.  Yeah, Syracuse.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Syracuse.  Dinosaurs.  Big and militia.  I'm literally having an anxiety attack right now.  This is, like, unbelievable.  I didn't care before I became a parent to this level.  Dude, don't be upset.  I'll be back tomorrow. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, hi, Jay.  You just got here.  I was only doing 79 today.  I have to go tape Good Day, New York with Jay to the end.  Nicolini.  Jill Nicolini?  No.  What time are you going to be on?  You going to see Jill Nicolini?  I don't know.  Say hi to Jill.  Well, we're going to be simulcasting your appearance on that show, too.  And I'm promoting Caroline's tomorrow, Friday, and Sunday.  So hopefully it will go well.  And then I've got the Huffington Post.  You know, just a big day of press.  You want to see what I'm going to do to get a big laugh? 
[02:21:30]  Watch this.  Hey, where is everybody?  His sunglasses are on Upside Down.  Fucking place is going to go nuts.  Well, I want to wear my sunglasses upside down.  Bye, guys.  Well, I want to put my sunglasses on Upside Down.  So I'll know that it's the other Troy Kwan and not me.  But what does the other Troy Kwan think?  Because he's thinking the same thing.  Because he's in love with me. 
[02:22:00]  Troy.  I can't wait until he gets back here.  I want to see his new schnozzola.  He's not going to realize that we got this whole new bit for him.  Oh, yeah.  He will realize.  Thanks to social media.  Yes, I'm sure I tweeted.  I never knew that Jehovah's Witnesses, Jehovah's Witnesses, right?  Yeah.  Didn't celebrate birthdays.  What's that about?  I had no idea until today.  They don't celebrate shit.  I didn't know that until today. 
[02:22:30]  No.  Why?  What's the reasoning?  I don't know.  They see all this celebration as something that just isn't necessary.  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure it out as I talk.  Wait a minute.  And I realize I just don't fucking know.  I don't understand the people that just refuse to take advantage of everything that is offered  to us on a daily basis.  Yeah.  And just go through their life as boring as possible.  Why would you do that?  Yeah.  Why the fuck would you do that?  There's a couple of fun things out there for the taking. 
[02:23:00]  A lot of fun things.  It's up to you how far you want to go with all the fun things, right?  Yeah.  There are people walking around right now that won't do one fun thing.  I'm not allowed to come to the party.  Hey, you want to come to my birthday party?  I'm not allowed.  Why?  Well, I'm a Jehovah's Witness.  What does that mean?  Well, my parents say I can't come to the party.  And then they spend their time knocking on people's doors and trying to convince them  not to celebrate their birthdays.  Right.  Are you having fun in there with that birthday party?  Yeah.  How about not? 
[02:23:30]  How would it feel to you?  We say you shouldn't.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you like to not be having that fun?  You think it bothers them, though, as they're knocking on your door and you open it up and  there's obviously a kid party going on.  Parties going on.  In the back of the house and they could hear the fun going on.  Christmas.  They don't celebrate Christmas.  Well, I could understand that one.  Why?  It just becomes a hassle after a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I've never thought of Christmas as a religious holiday.  And most people haven't.  No, you just think of it as a tree in the house. 
[02:24:00]  You know it's attached to a religious thing.  But we don't actually go there.  I don't think that's the brunt of everyone's energy on Christmas is to celebrate it as a  religious holiday.  You kind of just celebrate it as Christmas.  It's a whole different thing.  You go to Christmas mass some and that's an hour.  Yeah.  That's it.  One hour maybe you think about it as a religious holiday.  No, we got time.  You certainly don't.  We got Easter coming up.  Never thought of it as a religious holiday.  You just think like Easter eggs, dinner at family's house and stuff.  But it's not like this. 
[02:24:30]  You know, unless you're really religious and even in that case, you'll go to church, right?  You'll celebrate the resurrection.  The one way ticket to the resurrection.  And then it's something that's just not about religion anymore.  It's about hanging out with your family and eating some ham and some turkey and some chocolate  Easter eggs and peeps.  Nice.  Fresh peeps, by the way.  I don't like when they get sales.  Go get me some peeps. 
[02:25:00]  Peeps.  Peeps are good.  I had some two days ago.  They're fucking around with the peeps, too, man.  You had some peeps two days ago?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  They're so good.  You know, when we were growing up as children of the 80s there, Sam?  Yeah, I remember that.  We only had one peep.  One peep.  It was yellow.  We only had the yellow peeps.  Yellow peeps.  And then, like, when we were starting to get out of the 80s, I believe they threw the  pink in there, right?  Yeah.  But now they're out of control.  Go to the peeps' website, please.  I got one of the peep, one of the pink, and one of the stink.  I stick one finger up the chocolate bunny's fucking the hole in the bottom, so my finger 
[02:25:30]  comes out brown.  So I got one of the pink and one of the stink.  I had blue peeps the other day.  Blue, huh?  Blue.  It needed the money!  See?  Sticking with the theme of today.  Sure.  With your blue hat, it started.  Uh-huh.  Sam.  Oh, my God.  Look at all these colors.  Ah, there's green peeps, orange peeps.  There's gold peeps.  Gold peeps.  What?  That's right.  That's crazy.  There's gold peeps.  Why would you...  Oh, there it is.  What?  Hey, this is the Golden Ticket theme song.  It sure is, Ant.  If you don't get it, just listen to the replay at the beginning of the show. 
[02:26:00]  Shut up.  Let me go.  Let's go yellow.  Let's see the colors.  Yellow peeps are the best.  What's that one?  Pink.  That's a pink peep.  All right.  I might be colorblind.  That's a purple peep.  That's purple.  That's a purple peep.  You look great in me.  Purple peep eater is what I've become.  What else?  There's a blue peep.  All right.  That's not blue.  That's aqua.  That is kind of a turquoise.  Aqua.  Turquoise.  I was swimming in that color, peeps.  Yeah.  Over the vacation.  What's the next one?  Where are my peeps at? 
[02:26:30]  Green, yo.  Green peeps.  Within fish.  They say whales.  Poof.  Poof.  Poof.  Poof.  Poof.  That was a bad one.  Right after my bad one.  Oh, no.  Believe it or not.  Mine could possibly be the worst joke ever said on this radio show.  Can you go backwards?  Talking about green peeps.  Yeah.  I would go with the orange peeps.  You would.  Do they taste orangey?  No.  All these peeps taste exactly the same. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, they do.  However.  I like fresh peeps, by the way, because they're very, they almost have that crunchy, sugary thing  to them.  There's so much fucking sugar in there that when you bite it, you just feel.  Chocolate peeps.  You just squeeze your hand into the tightest fist ever after you peeps.  Oh, my God.  It's crazy.  You're just on a sugar rush.  You don't feel right.  Your head's spinning.  You could hear your pancreas pumping.  Just squeezing.  This is your pancreas.  Trying to get that shit together. 
[02:27:30]  You know what I hate about Easter Ant was the hollowed fucking Easter bunnies.  Chocolate Easter bunnies used to drive me nuts.  Yeah.  Especially as a kid, you thought you had a fucking chocolate bar.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  You didn't break it open.  It was like, it was paper thin.  Waffa thin.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Are we replaying that or we don't have to?  You're actually too busy texting.  I didn't say anything.  Do you know what we're asking for? 
[02:28:00]  No.  All right.  Forget it.  They could just listen in the replay.  You're safe.  You're safe.  You're safe.  You're skating.  Safe.  I got the article, by the way, with the PC thing.  There's one more thing to add.  This is unbelievable.  I'm seriously freaking out over this stuff.  Homes with swimming pools and computers and computers.  Computers.  Are also unmentionables here because of economic sensitivities, while computers in the school or in libraries are acceptable. 
[02:28:30]  Holy shit.  So you can mention a computer if it's also mentioned as being part of a library or some kind of place where anyone can go and use it.  Right.  But a home computer is only for the wealthy.  Dude, that just made me, I grew up poor and grew up poor.  I really grew up very fucking poor.  Yeah.  And it just made me fucking work hard and want and work for something.  I would have been fine with all this shit. 
[02:29:00]  Ridiculous.  I went to school and is it handy or hammy?  I always get that one wrong, too.  Hand me.  Hand me downs.  Yeah, because they hand them down.  Hand me downs.  I mean, we only went we only went clothes shopping once a year.  Maybe.  Wow.  We didn't even get haircuts because that was too much money.  So I had to grow my hair.  The Hughes kids just run around, hold ratty.  Oh, my God.  No joke.  My brothers will jump on this in a second.  We got one haircut a year.  Wow.  And my mom was cool enough that school was over, right to the barber, and it was the 
[02:29:30]  barbershop.  So it's like, you can't afford a fucking barbershop haircut?  Seriously?  How poor are you guys?  And then we get shaved completely down.  But she knew we would have freaked out if we had to go to school like that.  Oh, right.  Okay.  So they shave your head.  Completely down, knowing that it's going to take forever to grow in.  So they won't have to give you another one for a year.  Holy shit.  I knew I was poor, and I lived in a town out there in Centiport where people weren't really 
[02:30:00]  poor.  So I saw this every day, kids having everything I wanted.  Yeah.  But it just made me work harder and go, fuck, maybe I could get some of this stuff someday.  Man.  I didn't want someone to coddle me.  I'm poor.  Right.  We'll be poor.  I didn't want anyone to grab my head and fucking suckle me.  Why are we doing this?  Why?  Why?  It really is astounding that they're putting these rules in place to cater to what isn't 
[02:30:30]  the majority of the people.  I don't know.  What a bunch of fucking pansies.  We're raising pansies.  You think it'll ever turn around?  No.  Does this stuff go in stages?  No.  You don't think so?  I don't think so.  I think this is going to be one of those things that just kind of get worse and worse and  worse until the empire crumbles.  Until something else comes up.  Some fucking, you know, superpower.  Yeah.  I mean, we'll never all be the same. 
[02:31:00]  I don't know why we're trying to work toward that.  I don't understand that.  Bloomberg says future mayors should not live at Gracie Mansion.  What, does he want to take that place over to?  Just stay there forever?  No, he doesn't live there.  I know.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  No, he really doesn't.  I think he's one of the first mayors.  He was insulted that they wanted him to live there because his place is way better.  His digs are better.  Way better.  Yeah.  Where's this Gracie Mansion? 
[02:31:30]  I have not fucked up.  I have no clue.  I know it's way uptown.  I know that much.  I think it's on the East River, I think.  Damn.  I think.  Because the NYPD, they took me around the island of Manhattan, something I've always wanted  to do for my birthday a few years ago.  On a boat.  Have you ever done it?  A complete loop?  Not with the cops, but I've done it.  A complete loop?  Yeah.  Yeah, all the way up.  How amazing is that?  Way up there.  To see Manhattan from the water.  Yeah.  You get to see some shit most people never see. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Righteous.  I guess what?  It's too big, and the upkeep on it is a taxpayer upkeep.  Yeah, I guess.  That might be why.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  A radio station we both used to work at.  Oh.  WBAB, the home of rock and roll.  Long Island.  What kind of wackiness is going on there?  Ready for this?  Ed in Stony Brook.  Ed.  Hey, what's up, O?  Hey.  Yeah, I was listening to the radio, and I was switching back to the regular radio. 
[02:32:30]  Wait, what part made you switch to regular radio?  How bad were we?  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  Not that you guys are bad, but it's after you watch the show, and you turn back once in a while just to see how it is.  And this is why you don't go back, because they do things like this.  Instead of calling it the Easter Bunny, they're calling it the Spring Bunny.  Which, I was in shock, actually, when I heard that, but, I mean, no one calls it a Spring Bunny.  The Spring Bunny, because Easter is, you know, not inclusive. 
[02:33:00]  I've heard Easter a million times and never thought religion.  Spring Bunny.  Never thought about it.  Spring Bunny.  All right.  All-American home of rock and roll.  Ah, Jesus.  We're fucked.  Ah, Spring Bunny.  See, I guess the kids coming up, though, they don't know any better, but as a guy and a lot of other parents out there that have lived through it differently, to have your kids come home and go,  Hey, you know, they gave us all Spring Bunnies today.  I would start pulling the remaining hair out of my head. 
[02:33:30]  A hollow Spring Bunny.  All right.  Spring Bunnies, Ant.  Spring Bunnies.  Look at that, boys.  Thank you.  Spring fucking bunnies.  That's bullshit.  I say that's bullshit.  Teacher thinks city is changing testing to level playing field.  What?  That's ridiculous.  You know what Easter eggs are becoming?  What?  Spring spheres.  What? 
[02:34:00]  It's not a joke.  That's from an article.  So why don't they just say spring eggs, at least?  They wanted alliteration.  What?  Alliteration.  What?  Alliteration.  What?  Alliteration.  I got OCD.  I could do this all day.  You really want to do this?  I'll do it for an hour and a half.  Easy.  Let's do it.  Fine by me.  You're never going to win the OCD shit with me.  Ever.  What is it, though?  Alliteration. 
[02:34:30]  Now I'm in a quandary.  Quandary quandary.  Well, I'm in such a quandary with my new nose.  Can't wait to see his new nose.  So psyched.  Randy wants me to homeschool.  Randy in St. Paul, Minnesota.  What's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  No.  You know, if you're that concerned, you can always homeschool.  I mean, it's not unheard of.  And a lot of the religious folks do that.  Yeah, but how do the kids socialize?  Because I remember the homeschool kids.  They were a little weird.  A little fucking off.  A little funny.  Because they didn't get to hang out with people their own age during school hours.  Right.  Well, hanging out during school is one thing.  But remember, when you're in school, you're pretty much, you know, you're doing the, you know,  three hours and experiments and whatnot. 
[02:35:30]  But after you're done school and you're out playing with your friends, right?  To this day, I have to figure out if it's 2, T-O, or T-O-O.  And you want me to homeschool my kids.  I still can't even figure that one out.  And how much work is it?  Is it a second job?  T-O-O is also.  Right.  That's how I usually use it.  Yeah.  But sometimes I'm like, oh, but the also part doesn't fit there.  Well, hey.  And then I'll look it up and it'll still be T-O-O.  Hey, Hope, you're in the perfect position. 
[02:36:00]  I mean, you know, you roll out at 9 o'clock and you can start teaching the kids.  9 o'clock, Sam.  He doesn't roll out at 9 o'clock.  He rolls out at 10 o'clock at the earliest.  Me and Ann have been doing an extra hour for all these years.  We're supposed to roll out at 9.  Let's get out of here.  Fuck, Randy.  Thanks for helping us out with that.  I didn't realize.  I'm gone.  10 o'clock at the earliest.  You're welcome to stay till 11.  Nah, nah.  Blame me because it was the time zone difference.  We're out here in the central time zone.  Oh, are you?  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, is Jimmy going to be on?  Goodbye.  Is Jimmy going to be on this one?  Channel 5 up top?  Yeah, right.  Oh, you think he's going to meet Ivanka Trump?  I hope so.  Look how harsh he looks.  Is he going to get a picture with Ivanka?  No?  What's the matter, Kenny?  Kenny's got some exclusive information on this.  Kenny?  He made the delivery of Jimmy Norton.  He's taping at a remote location.  Oh.  When are they going to Jimmy?  9.20.  Oh, fuck.  Let's take a break.  I want to watch that.  Kenny, why didn't you tell us to take a break before the Jimmy segment? 
[02:37:00]  Because I get chastised for chiming in.  You certainly do.  All right.  I got Uncle Paul at the Super Bowl.  Then when we come back, hopefully Jim Norton on TV again.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now because here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you. 
[02:37:30]  In today's episode, Uncle Paul writes the FCC about MIA's performance during the Super Bowl halftime show.  To whom it may concern, I would like to see the fuck-fine the Willie B. Jeepers out of that wannabe star Mia.  Her little stunt was not cute.  If she wants to challenge authority, then show us some authority, fuck dudes.  The city of Minneapolis did a great job, as did the Newfoundland, Maddener, and the other guests who had class. 
[02:38:00]  But this wannabe star that none of us have ever heard of has the gal to come over our home and enjoy the celebrity of being a star at the Super Bowl just to fly like a bird.  What a disrespectful wrench.  Please show this woman that her cunt was not appreciated.  Either B-A-N or F-I-N-E.  Who's that old guy over there? 
[02:38:30]  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now because here comes Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  Is this us?  Yes, it's us.  Yeah, we got to come back because Jim Norton's on TV.  More TV for Jim Norton.  It's a big TV day for Jimmy. 
[02:39:00]  And he's got gigs.  He's got gigs.  He's got big Carolines this weekend.  Jimmy Norton.  Sounds a little like that, right?  DJ Paul Adi will be in studio.  He seems to be one of the more normal Jersey Shore guys.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  He's got his shit together the most, I think.  I think so.  He's actually got something he's doing.  Vinny's normal and Paul, Pauly there.  Pauly D is normal.  All right.  Yeah, I think so.  More. 
[02:39:30]  The sitch certainly isn't normal.  No, he's insane.  The unit is a fucking whack job.  The unit.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Enough with the unit.  Yeah, I think Pauly D is the one who actually has stuff together and has a real somewhat  of a business outside of the show and all that stuff.  Well, and he's doing the spinoff.  The spinoff?  Is it called a spinoff?  He's spinning off against it.  His show?  Oh, oh, oh.  Not a spinoff like that.  See, we say spinoff.  He thinks, we being child of the 80s, we say spinoff. 
[02:40:00]  Right.  He thinks a DJ competition.  We have a spinoff.  Wow, what's wrong with you?  He's a DJ.  It works.  But a spinoff is a TV show.  You spin it off.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got his own show.  They make a pallet.  We so didn't have to come back when we did, huh?  No, we didn't know.  I told Eric to.  We didn't know.  I heard 920 for James P. Norton.  That's what Kenny said.  Kenny has steered you wrong before as far as breaks go.  Never.  As far as breaks go?  Never. 
[02:40:30]  Once before, maybe?  Never.  Nail on the head every time.  All right.  He knows.  They're calling it Valentine's Day, Friendship Day in my daughter's daycare.  That's Brian J. Gooder-ass, I guess.  Why?  Valentine's doesn't mean anything?  No, man.  You're friends with people, and you want to fuck other things.  What?  You can't.  No, you know what I mean.  I mean, Valentine's Day is love and all that, so you can't say friends.  It's a totally different meaning.  Yeah, Friendship Day should be every day.  Right.  If I may impart a lesson to everybody out there. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Jimmy's going to be on with Jill.  Jill's working at Fox, huh?  Yeah.  She moved over there a while ago.  She does entertainment now for them.  Oh, no more traffic girl.  She's past that weather traffic.  What was she doing traffic?  She was the traffic girl, and then she was kind of delving into entertainment thing over  there at PIX11.  Right.  But I guess they weren't moving fast enough.  Nope. 
[02:41:30]  So we're like, hey, get your ass over here.  Paulie D's spinoff.  He goes to Vegas with his pals.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to it.  He's got a big contract with Hard Rock Cafe, I think.  Was it?  One of the, or the Palms.  The Palms.  Right.  The Palms.  What?  Palms.  And he also was doing some AC shit at Harrah's.  Air conditioning?  Yeah.  On the show, he went on tour with Britney Spears.  Yeah, I know.  He talked about that already.  So the show's way behind.  Yeah, but no.  Last time he was in, he just got off the road with Britney Spears. 
[02:42:00]  You get to watch it.  And now he signed with 50 Cent.  50.  50.  Why not say 50?  It's like saying Ditty.  You don't say Ditty.  You say Ditty.  Ditty.  Ditty.  P. Ditty.  Because there's no T's in Ditty's name.  Well, Fitty should be Fitty.  It's Fitty.  No, it's 50.  I don't know.  I kind of like Fitty.  Yeah, but generally white people say Fitty.  Generally.  Oh, so you're admitting you're not white.  Because you say 50. 
[02:42:30]  No, I think it's kind of standing when white people say Fitty.  Oh, he's on that show with the guy.  What?  Ray Kelly's son there that was in a bit of trouble.  Oh, the rape allegations that never went through.  Yeah, remember that guy.  Let's remember this.  There was no...  What was somebody from the...  I did not.  That's part of the sandwich.  Duke, I already told you.  I don't want to eat the bread.  You don't have to eat the bread, but everything else.  The lettuce is the easy part.  Wait, there's one piece there.  He doesn't eat carbs.  Take all the bread.  Our Friday correspondent, Bo Deedle, is watching as well.  Bo Deedle.  Bo Deedle.  Bo Deedle. 
[02:43:00]  Bo Deedle?  Bo Deedle?  Bo Deedle.  Don't mess with her.  That's how Sam would say it.  You don't mess with her a lot.  No?  Uh-huh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The whole sandwich.  Wow.  The next one's a lot.  Oh, yeah.  What is that?  Roast beef?  Oh, the Jetbo sandwich.  Roast beef, corned beef, patrami, four slice of white bread, American cheese, lettuce,  tomato, and mayonnaise.  Anyways, that's the Jetbo sandwich at the Carnegie Deli.  I just want to lie.  You like your meat bloody?  You like your roast beef bloody? 
[02:43:30]  Let me tell you.  I don't.  I've been getting roast beef that is not just your roast beef.  This is like cut from prime rib shit.  Nice.  Or actually cut from a filet mignon.  It's the best roast beef I've ever had.  You don't want your bloody, do you?  It wouldn't be allowed on New York City school tests.  That's how fucking good it is.  It's delicious.  Yeah, I like it a little rare.  But not bloody, right?  It gets chewy when it's bloody.  No, no.  Not roast beef bloody.  You want that dark shit on the edges. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, calm down.  And you don't put mayonnaise on beef.  I go crazy.  You don't put mayonnaise on beef.  Instead of watching Jimmy, we've got to watch him make a huge sandwich.  You said you can't get your mouth around.  Is that the sandwich they actually give you?  Yes.  You haven't been to the Carnegie Deli?  No, I never got a sandwich like that.  Dude, they think they're doing you a favor.  It's the biggest pain in the ass to eat there.  Why would you get that?  We're going to go to Jill Nicolini because there is a Caroline's Comedy Madness competition  going on tonight.  They're down to the final four.  And Jill Nicolini, we got a little taste of it before. 
[02:44:30]  Look at that.  You got a little taste of the final four.  And again, if you want to come see them, you've got to come down here tonight and check them  out because right now, I got rid of those guys.  They were, okay, I'm going to be honest.  They were just okay.  But right here, I have very experienced, very well-seasoned comedians.  This is Jim Norton.  So Jim's joining us this morning.  What's going on?  Jimmy!  Thanks, Jill.  How horrifying to have to tell jokes to five people in a room.  That's harder than talking to 500.  Yeah, yeah.  That's Bob Kelly.  There's not too many people out there, is there?  No, I'm kidding.  I didn't see the segment, but I heard they were terrific. 
[02:45:00]  You know how humiliating it would be if Caroline fired me and hired one of them for this week?  That's not going to happen, but you actually are going to be here at Caroline starting tomorrow night.  I am, yes, tomorrow through Sunday.  All right, so you're an author, you are a comedian, you're on the Opie and Anthony show,  you're on Jay Leno, you're on Fox News, you're everywhere.  Yes.  What don't you do?  Sell a lot of tickets.  So that's why I'm here.  Self-promotion.  Yeah, the flu is also everywhere, but nobody wants to see that live either.  New York Times bestseller, may I add? 
[02:45:30]  Jim, so tell me, how do you be funny?  How do I learn to be funny?  Oh, boy.  I would say that the thing about a joke is it should catch people off guard.  You're a riot, Jill.  You don't want it to be something that they see coming.  She's funny, right?  So you say something, and then maybe you put a little hook at the end of it.  She takes possessions, puts them in a fire pit, lights them on fire.  Give me a shot.  That's a good joke.  She's a shotgun dad.  I wouldn't say this is my best joke, but...  Give me one.  Give me one for Fox.  I'm in a relationship.  I like the way she said it for Fox to make sure it's not dirty.  I'm in a relationship now, and I think the weirdest part about being in a relationship is after sex, 
[02:46:00]  I just have to keep repeating to myself, do not hand her cash.  Do not hand her cash.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  Let Joe Michelini have a stab at this.  Excuse me.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jim.  Hello, everyone.  Here's my joke.  How do you make a tissue dance?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Put a little boogie in it.  Jim?  I don't know.  Put a little boogie in it.  Sorry to ruin it for everyone.  Yeah, that's my joke.  You spoiler.  Sorry.  It's terrific.  I actually should open with that tonight, but I'm probably going to screw it up.  Do not hand her boogie tissue. 
[02:46:30]  Boo.  Boo.  That was actually very good.  Thank you.  Very clever.  Very elementary.  Yeah, I like the fact that you went right for boogers, too.  I really respect that.  Oh, thanks.  Well, Jim, we can all come out here again tomorrow night through the rest of the weekend.  Come see Jim Norton here at Caroline's Comedy Club in New York City.  Log on to MyFoxNY.com.  Click on the Good Day tab, and, of course, we'll link you up.  And I'm looking forward to seeing you again, because you are the best.  You're awesome.  Thank you, Jill, very much.  Any last words to the station?  I think we look really good together, and I'd love to do this segment weekly.  I'm a desperate man.  Please. 
[02:47:00]  All right, Jim and Jill, thank you so much.  I can see them as a pair when we go on vacation.  What do you think?  Hey, not on this show.  All right, listen.  Don't talk with your mouthful.  Coming up on Good Day New York, new details revealed.  He's a weirdo.  I think she's...  Joe McHale loves playing Greg Kelly clips.  That's his name, right?  Greg Kelly?  She might be, you know.  She might not want to go with a person from this show.  She might be put off a little from anybody from this very program. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Let's go back to break now.  What?  Why not?  Do another short one?  Yeah.  Until we get Paulie here.  Paulie D.  And don't forget, you know, he also had a hit single.  What?  I like that song.  Beat that beat.  It's time to...  Oh.  I like this, actually.  Beat that beat up.  Beat that beat up.  Come on.  There you go.  Beat that beat up.  Oh, God.  Beat that beat up.  Beat that beat up. 
[02:48:00]  It feels that way.  It's time to...  Beat that beat up.  This is so bad.  I just feel like I'm in a crowded club.  By the way...  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  Spy Guy 925.  How do you make a tissue dance?  The correct answer was blow it.  That's a good one.  Very good.  And that has two meanings.  So they might have been able to do that on TV.  Where are we at with the Paulie D. guy? 
[02:48:30]  Is he here?  Is he in the building?  At any moment.  Is he in the building?  Is he here, though?  I don't think he's in the building yet.  He will be at any moment.  So why don't we do the single break thing, then?  Why not?  What?  What? 
[02:49:00]  I want to welcome Paulie D. to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Where is he?  Oh, that's Travis.  Sorry, Travis.  Oh, that's...  Fuck.  Got confused for a moment.  What's going on with this Paulie D., man?  He's not that famous.  What the fuck?  Let's go.  When do we give up on the Paulie D? 
[02:49:30]  Never.  10 o'clock.  We kind of had to leave early today, too.  For some thanks.  Dings?  Still be here in a minute.  People are checking in downstairs.  Yeah, but is he checking in?  I don't know.  Yeah, he just did.  He just did.  You just got a text?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so did I.  Checking in on his way up.  Checking in.  Well, I mean, yeah.  I came for it.  Kind of, technically.  All right.  So he's coming.  All right, we need 30 seconds of filler.  Better not be bullshitting us.  No, I'm not. 
[02:50:00]  I'm rolling.  Checking in on this.  I mean, rolling.  Travis.  When are we going to announce?  I just got a text.  Oh, okay.  Eric just got a text.  When are we going to announce the Cleveland thing?  This is getting stupid.  People are like, what the fuck?  Because people are driving from faraway lawns to join us in Cleveland.  Okay, well, I mean.  And then because of the Twitter social networking thing, I want everyone to organize.  Because it's like, you know, if we get a couple other bars and stuff involved, like fans that  are coming from all over the place can meet each other.  I think that'd be kind of cool.  So say this.  Hard Rock Cafe?  Well, no.  Don't say that. 
[02:50:30]  Why not say the place we're going to be?  Because that's not signed and dotted yet.  Kenny?  Kenny, don't lie to me.  Am I putting you in a bad spot?  Yeah.  No, you're not putting anybody in a bad spot.  Here he comes.  Our guest is here.  All right, Pauly D is entering the studio.  Travis, get out of the goddamn seat.  Pauly's here.  Hey, Pauly D, what's up?  How you doing, man?  Take a seat.  Take my seat.  Oh, yeah.  Right there.  Oh, you're getting the signature thing right out of the way, are you, Kenny? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's smart.  Can you believe we're actually on the air?  We're live right now?  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  We haven't seen Pauly D in a while.  Yes.  Man, are you blowing up.  I'm trying to.  Just trying to make a living.  I was just saying, and I'm going to say it to your face, too.  You're one of the normal ones from the Jersey Shore.  Oh, thank you.  And we've had you all in.  And we like everyone.  We really do.  The only one we haven't met is Ronnie.  Oh, you haven't met Ronnie yet?  No.  And I hear he's really fucking cool, too.  Yeah, he's cool.  Vinny comes on on a regular basis. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, he loves it here.  And he's your boy.  He's my boy, for sure.  Yeah, yeah.  He comes in a lot.  And I think he's obviously very normal, as well.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Except for that, you know, depression thing.  Yeah.  We're going to get him through that, I think.  You know what?  He has self-help books that's been helping him.  Oh, yeah?  I mean, I'm like, you're laughing.  Because Paul is the type of guy, I guarantee you're like, what?  I know.  How could anyone be depressed?  It's summer on the Jersey Shore.  I was like, come on, man.  Right.  Why are you depressed?  Oh, yeah.  We're getting paid, too.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  You're getting paid to go out every night and bring girls home. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I would be depressed, too, I guess.  What's the new show about?  The new show, I'm really excited about it, because everybody knows me.  From Jersey Shore, they just know me partying in Jersey with a bunch of strangers that became  my friends, but now they get to see where I come from, they get to meet my lifelong  friends, and then they get to see what it's like on the road, being a day-to-day, trying  to be a world-famous DJ, and all the struggles that come along with it.  Trying.  I mean, you've got a big contract in Vegas, right?  Yes.  That we're going to see during the show, and also, I think you do a little Harris down 
[02:52:30]  in AC?  Yes.  Is that a contract, too, or is that a one-and-done thing?  No contract.  I've got the residency there, as well.  Right.  So, one in the East Coast, one in West Coast.  And he gets to bring his boys along.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Your buddies.  Now, do they...  Because not everybody is going to be good on camera.  Right.  Like, do they know what the deal is?  They...  I kind of prepped them.  I let them know.  I mean, they've been with me in seeing me do it for so long, so now they're doing it,  so we'll just see how...  They've been doing fine behind the camera.  It comes natural to them. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  I actually saw a long promo for the new show.  Yeah.  And his guys do all right.  Yeah.  You can tell they're characters, and you're going to do all right with that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's cool.  Are you a big partier down there on the Jersey Shore?  Because I do watch, and it doesn't seem like you drink as much as the other guys.  Yeah, no.  I definitely don't drink as much as them.  I like to party, but I don't need to...  That's not saying a lot, though, because they drink a lot.  Yeah.  Some of them drink a lot.  I drink casually.  I don't get too wasted, you know?  It seems like you and Vinny keep it under control more than the others. 
[02:53:30]  I noticed that from day one.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Yeah.  I see.  Look.  You're right.  I know my shit.  Hang.  Did you just sign with 50 Cent?  Yes.  We say 50.  It's all right.  You say 50.  Say 50.  Sam, you dick.  Stupid Sam.  He says we should be saying 50.  And what does that entail?  So I'm going to be doing some producing, and I'm going to come out with an album.  I'm going to be getting with some other producers and some other artists and come out with a compilation. 
[02:54:00]  And then we did a theme song as well for the Polly D project.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  The Closers produced it.  I executive produced it.  And it's got that.  So like when Alice sang the song, the opening for the Alice show?  Exactly like that.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  Yeah, like that.  Because that was great.  So I was just called Gibby Just Like That.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I was just called Night of My Life.  But I feel like every time you hear that song, you'll think of the show and vice versa. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Sort of like the Cheers theme.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll just mention 30-year-old shows.  I was thinking Sopranos-themed songs.  Of course.  Are you feeling some pressure?  Because a lot of people look toward you as the guy that's going to have a career after Jersey Shore.  A legit career.  A bunch of these guys will move on and do okay for a little while.  But people look at you like you have a real shot of longevity.  Oh, yeah.  And that's what I'm striving for.  I mean, it's been a blessing for me, this whole TV stuff.  Because with my DJ career, I was able to DJ all over the world.  And then they give me that shot, and I can prove to them that I can actually DJ. 
[02:55:00]  And that's how you lock down the residency.  So it's really been a blessing for me, and I'm happy.  And now you guys just signed for season six, Jersey Shore.  When's that?  I think we stopped filming in June sometime.  And do you know anything about the rumors that came out today about the situation and Snooki being phased out?  I heard that.  Phased out?  But I don't think it's true.  I think it's just a rumor because I heard that all eight of us are going back.  Regardless of the situation, we're all going back.  Well, Snooki's going to be pregnant down there.  Yeah, so it'll be different. 
[02:55:30]  A little different.  A little, huh?  The best thing about it is it's reality, so in reality, people get knocked up.  But she's not going to live in the house as a pregnant broad, is she?  I don't know.  I imagine she'd have to be some kind of part of it, but I don't know.  Well, yeah, you've got to have Snooki part of a Jersey Shore.  We support her and her.  She's happy, so.  What I like about the new season of the Jersey Shore, you laugh at Gianni.  Oh, my God.  Who wouldn't?  You think he's kind of like a dummy. 
[02:56:00]  Because you've got to think about it.  I mean, he's okay with her doing all this stuff.  Right.  Crazy.  Yeah.  You've got to question, like, what's going on here?  Yeah, yeah, right?  It's like, yeah, there's supposed to be an item.  I mean.  But she goes off on a tear.  I heard some rumors that, like, the drinking during pregnancy, was she doing that?  Oh, I don't think so.  Yeah, yeah.  When I seen her, she was straight as an arrow.  Sober.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, that must be a bitch for her, though.  She was weird.  She sat right where you were, and we asked her flat out if she was pregnant, and she lied to us. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, really?  And we're not going to get over that any time soon.  Oh, wow.  She lied right to our face.  Of course she was going to lie, though.  Right to our faces.  You knew it.  Yeah, boy.  I wonder, I wonder, now, now she's a little fire plug.  Yeah.  You know?  I wonder what, because babies sometimes tear a bitch up, man.  Oh.  You know?  She's little, too.  Ah, she's going to.  Ah.  That's going to not look good.  This is big momadell.  That's going to be tough to put back together.  These big fucking hangers.  These little Snookers, right?  Oh, man.  That's going to be tough to put back together. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, did the situation get a blowjob from Snooki?  I don't know, because he said she did.  You still don't know?  Nope.  The whole season has been hinting at this damn thing, and we don't get closure on this shit.  Well, because he says she did, and she says he didn't.  Right.  And, I mean.  But you know.  I feel like he did.  Okay.  You know?  But I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he's playing it up the whole season.  Yeah.  And is the unit a tool?  Oh, my God.  He comes across like a fucking tool.  Exactly how you come across on TV is exactly how you are. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, that guy.  He is a tool.  Really is, though.  And maybe a little too much with the steroids.  I don't know.  I know.  There's something going on there.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I watch.  I watch the show.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I watch, Paulie.  I'm not going to lie to you.  A lot of people don't know why.  But I'm not in your demo.  So I don't know why I should be watching this.  But I enjoy it.  I think the demo is interesting for the show.  Yeah.  People that I never think would watch it, watch it.  I mean, if I walk into a store or something, there'll be somebody, I don't know, like  an old lady, be like, oh, my God, Paulie D.  I'm like, how the hell are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  You know.  Crazy.  And then it'll be like little kids.  I'm like, are you even old enough to watch my show?  Yeah.  It's amazing, though.  What season is this now?  Come on.  This is coming up on six.  Coming up on six, yeah.  Sixth season.  In only a couple, like three years, I guess, maybe?  It is.  And then after we filmed season one, I didn't even think we were going to do it, too.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  And now here we are already on six.  Right.  Man.  That is something.  Yeah, because you didn't think it was going to go this long.  And have a spin-off show now.  It's been a hell of a ride.  Ronnie can't wait to come in here because he wants to tell Snooki stories.  He told you, right? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  He said that Snooki loved to just kind of hang out in the doorways and watch you guys  bang girls.  Yes, he did.  Oh, my God.  Yes, he did.  What's that all about?  Holy shit.  That kind of rocks.  She likes to watch.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  I remember telling Dina one time, she's like, oh, yeah, you got to bring in a boy home?  All right, good.  I'm going to watch.  I was like, huh?  Wow.  Would she do anything or just watch?  Just watch.  Dina's a train wreck.  She really is, man.  She's actually sweet.  She's actually a nice girl.  She likes to party, though. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, boy, does she.  She falls down a lot.  Jimmy's back.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She falls down a lot.  Hey, Jimmy Norton.  She can't walk.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she falls down a lot.  I've never seen anything like it in my life.  She likes to drink a little bit and then maybe teeter over.  Yeah.  Are you still living with your dad in Rhode Island?  Mm-hmm.  When are you going to move out?  I don't know.  You're going to pull a deep money now.  I'm never there.  I literally just go there to see him, see my mother, and then I fly right back out.  I'm only home for a day or two.  And I have no time to buy a place. 
[02:59:30]  I'm DJing every night of the week.  That's like your base of operations, but you don't really have a home?  Correct.  I live in the airport.  You're living in hotels.  Yeah, hotels.  Is that getting old?  No, because you know what?  When I'm in Vegas, I'm in Vegas a lot.  The hotel they give me is unbelievable.  Killer, man.  There's a pool inside, outside, jacuzzi, like an elevator.  It's crazy.  Wow.  You're making money.  This kid is making money.  Right.  Right.  And I don't have time to spend it.  Right.  I'm going to watch this show.  I'm going to watch the spinoff.  What is it officially called?  It's called The Pauly D Project. 
[03:00:00]  Right.  And it premieres Thursday at 1030.  Yep.  It's going to follow Punk'd, the new season of Punk'd.  I saw Justin Bieber's involved with that.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we're going to get him to tweet about the show, too.  Oh, good.  I might get a couple of followers on Twitter.  Yeah.  He tends to.  Do they?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Did you guys talk about the Britney Spears lap dance?  No.  We did last time, I think, but yeah.  What a rip.  That was the best day of my life.  It was nice.  Because you know how crazy that was for me?  Because being a DJ, I played her music my whole life. 
[03:00:30]  I've always been a fan of her.  So the fact that she knows I exist now is cool.  I DJed her tour is cool.  But she gave me a lap dance.  Like, who can say that?  Yeah, not many people, huh?  Who can say Britney Spears gave them a lap dance?  Was it a good lap dance?  Yeah, it was great.  My head was right there.  Yeah?  Nice.  We would have wanted the 17-year-old version of Britney giving us lap dances.  She look all right still?  She looks good.  Yeah?  She still does.  Yeah, she works out hard, too.  She has a trainer she travels with.  How are the eyes?  Are they a little crazy?  Crazy eyes.  Does she have crazy eyes? 
[03:01:00]  She's attractive.  She looks good.  Would you if you could?  Absolutely.  Oh, good.  She's engaged now with Jason.  Jason's a great guy, but if he wasn't...  Yeah, buddy.  Let's be honest.  Even if he was...  Men always say that.  Like, well, she's in a relationship.  We never really care.  I mean, it's just a matter of...  We know that that's what's stopping the woman from actually doing it.  Jimmy's back.  I have time for my next interview.  I'm not going to just sit in Caroline's front.  Next interview?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're like crazy today.  He's a busy guy.  Jimmy's very busy also. 
[03:01:30]  It's called desperate to sell tickets.  I'll talk to him.  Al Jazeera wanted to interview me right now.  I'd talk to him.  Oh, did the situation go in rehab?  Yes, I heard he did.  But then they announced the new season of Jersey Shore, so then they're like, no, he didn't go  into rehab because they need the situation to drink, don't you think?  Well, I don't know.  I heard the rumor that he did.  I didn't know he had a problem, and I just haven't talked to him.  You didn't know.  Do you watch your own show?  But I'm not familiar with that stuff.  I've never did drugs in my life, so I just thought he was weird.  Really?  Yeah.  You never got high? 
[03:02:00]  No.  Wow.  Yeah, how much did you drink?  A little bit or a lot?  A little bit, casually.  Not as much as the other guys.  We noticed that.  So you like the smart one.  Not that they're dumb, but financially and stuff, you're really making a lot of the smarter  moves than a lot of people, it seems.  Well, I try to.  Try to keep a level head.  Paulie was always the smart one.  Yeah, can we dance at a wedding with me standing on your feet?  We're going to do Tessio references.  Yeah, you've been doing well, like investing, things like that, because, yeah, you know, 
[03:02:30]  sometimes this shit dries up.  No, no, I don't want to be like a football player and bankrupt after three years or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  So we invested a lot.  That's good.  We invested a chunk.  Hair gel?  Hair gel.  Tanning boots.  Yeah, tanning boots.  We got some.  Do you actually have some tanning salons?  No salons yet, but I got a lot of boots.  They send me them.  They send you tanning boots?  Yeah.  You're worried about the skin cancer?  Nah.  By the time you get it, you're so old, you can't do anything anyway.  Exactly. 
[03:03:00]  Exactly.  He knows the deal.  That's it.  Have fun now.  Oh, the other big rumor is that you're going to be DJing in the delivery room for Snooki.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I get asked to do that.  By Snooki?  Yeah, and if I can, I will do it.  I don't know if they allow that, though.  Yeah, really?  You're going to have to find a special hospital.  I think it would be kind of cool.  They don't even allow people to film anymore because of lawsuits.  You're not even allowed to stand there with a camera.  Oh, really?  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's going to be hard to picture you with a disco ball and a DJ sound.  All right, so maybe I'll just do the baby shower or something.  Yeah, yeah, that's a little bit. 
[03:03:30]  Wow, I didn't even think about that.  You can't film because doctors are afraid they're going to get them on video.  Maybe they'll let them from the other room, though, and let the music pipe in to make her feel comfortable.  I mean, maybe they will.  They'll work around it a little bit, probably.  Yeah.  Well, it's got to be distracting, though, if there's a problem or a complication.  You don't want to hear, you know, party people!  Put your hands up!  Get there.  Just have a kid fly out on a beat.  Oh, man.  I'm really glad I said something DJ-ish because I don't know what DJ's saying, but that was pretty good.  That was good.  That was good.  I thought I was like, what the fuck has Jimmy not done?  Pretty damn good. 
[03:04:00]  I think the show's going to do all right, though.  I hope so.  I'm a little nervous because it's the first show coming off Jersey Shore, and it's about only me.  You know what I mean?  Right.  I bring along my friends as well, but...  Any cameos by the guys?  Yeah, Vinny makes a cameo.  Oh, good.  Good for Vinny.  Yeah, because he's like my best friend for real, so he was part of my show.  Right.  How many shows did you get?  How many episodes?  Twelve.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  Half-hour episodes.  Yep.  Wow.  That's a nice season.  Yeah.  What else could you say about the new show?  It's kind of cool because you get to see what it's like behind the scenes for a DJ and what's 
[03:04:30]  involved in that.  Because on TV, you usually see like artists behind the scenes and all that.  You never see what goes on with the DJ.  Right.  Like the sound check and what can go wrong and packing the club and all that stuff.  So you get to see it, and I don't think there's another show on TV like it.  And you bring your best friends along, like we said.  One's a bouncer.  One's your manager.  And the third guy, I forgot.  What does he do?  He manages the club.  Manages the club.  And then another guy managed the clubs in Las Vegas.  We met him out there.  Right.  And now he's like part of my crew because we clicked instantly.  What about chicks?  Chicks, they're there.  You got some chicks on this fucking show? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  See that old guys that are good looking guys like you.  You need a guy.  I'm not trying to sell myself here for TV time.  But you need a guy who just kind of comes along, who's different, that people can lock  into, like the regular guy.  Yeah.  Like I could kind of be the moral compass of the show.  Come on.  Well, you're in a relationship.  Don't do that with me.  Make sure you wear a condom.  Yeah, that's right.  You could break up the party, Jimmy.  Yeah, I could just walk in every time you get laid.  Oh, come on now.  It's time for her to go.  Now, now.  She's been drinking.  Well, with the girls, it's kind of cool because you get to see what that's like, too.  Like being, trying to be a world famous DJ and how to get girls, like how to find 
[03:05:30]  a good girl and how to find the difference between the groupies.  You'll see that on the show.  Right, right.  Okay.  Because it's not easy.  I mean, it looks easy, but.  Yeah, you'd think a lot of the girls probably just, you know, hey, this guy's on TV.  Exactly.  He's the DJ.  And meanwhile, you know, and as far as getting laid, though, who cares, right?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't care what they want.  It's like, don't you want to find a girl, though, that isn't into you because you're on  TV?  I don't give a shit.  No.  Tonight, I don't give a shit.  If a girl's into me for my look, she's got problems. 
[03:06:00]  Jim, it's just your man tits and your stomach fat that I like.  Look, you're an idiot.  Do you hold that against a girl?  Well, because, like, anyone that bangs me on a much lower level than you, they're banging  me for the wrong reasons, always.  I never care.  I'll still be involved with that girl.  Do you like when a girl holds out on you?  Does that, like, turn you on?  Like, wow, okay, she's different?  Or does that mean nothing?  Doesn't mean anything.  Yeah, good.  I hate that shit.  You know what?  Because they only, I don't think they're just trying to prove something.  They're trying to be something that they're not.  You're not holding out. 
[03:06:30]  What are you holding out for?  You didn't have a hold out before in your life.  You're not acting like you're holding out now?  Oh, it's the thrill of the chase, though, that really gets, no.  No, it's not.  I like the meat being thrown into the cage.  I don't want to hunt down the zebra.  I'm a zoo animal.  As soon as you run, I close my door behind you.  Sometimes it is too easy.  Like, I remember on the show, you'll see, I walk into a club, and immediately I see a  girl, she grabs me, she's like, let's go back to the hotel.  I'm like, I just got here.  I want to chill out for a second.  Wow, yeah.  And so I ended up shying her away, and we grabbed somebody else.  That must just suck. 
[03:07:00]  That's when you hit, like, you hit big on a blackjack table when you first sit down.  Right.  And you're like, now I can only go down from here.  I'm going to fucking lose.  Let me translate.  A fat girl grabbed him and said, let's go back to the hotel.  He's like, did you?  Yeah, she was fucking really smoking.  She was dope.  She was hot?  Okay.  Yeah, she was hot.  Do you throw a fatty in there every once in a while?  I mean, fat girls need love, too.  Then he said on the last episode that he likes some chunky girls because a lot of the hot  ones just lay there and do nothing.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  You want a girl who earns it. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  You want a girl who earns it.  Like a girl who knows how to pull it out of you.  Hot ones expect us to lay there and have you, you know, have you want to bang them.  Yeah.  I've heard.  Nothing wrong with a pig every once in a while, right?  A pig?  No, no.  I don't like the fat one, though.  I don't mind one that's ugly, but I can't take a big fatty, but someone can have like  a fucking awful seahorse face or whatever, and I'll still bang them.  She's got a butter face.  Exactly.  But if she's, like, young, then the fat's not as bad.  Yeah.  Baby fat.  Yeah, when she has the youth on her side, then the fat is in his bed. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, I guess he's right.  I like a little, maybe a little bit of baby fat, but after that, like, if she has to ask  for a seatbelt extender, I'm close to that.  I'm close to that.  That's a problem.  That's a problem.  And I don't want a girl that can, like, bench press more than me, either, so she has to  be somewhat petite.  Oh, you don't like the big, strong ones?  No.  I don't mind them, because they have big clits.  Oh, my God.  They do.  Oh, God.  What?  He calls them clits.  They have big clits because of the drugs they're on, the steroids or whatever.  That's a great point, but I don't mind that. 
[03:08:30]  If a girl's smart because she smokes pot, I'm not going to question it.  I don't know.  I think, yeah, I don't like the bodybuilder-type chicks.  They don't look, it's like a guy.  Yeah, no, exactly.  How about a yoga body?  A nice, long yoga chick.  Yoga bodies have amazing bodies.  That's completely different.  They are, right?  They could put their legs behind their head.  Oh, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Interesting.  Oh, yeah.  I never require that, though, because by the time the knees hit the ears, I'm finished.  It never has to go back that far.  Oh, man.  Rollins, Rollins. 
[03:09:00]  We're getting the wrap-up, Paulie D.  Oh.  We're waving.  So the new show, what's the big plug again there?  So it's going to be this Thursday night.  It's called The Paulie D. Project on MTV at 1030 following the brand-new season of Punk'd.  That's it?  Yeah, buddy.  All right, hold on.  Well, good luck, man.  Thank you.  Let me get a picture for the Twitter there.  Oh.  Yeah, why not?  With his giant iPhone.  What is that thing?  This is not a giant iPhone.  No, it's a droid.  I call it the giant.  It's a fucking droid.  He carries a blackboard.  It's a great phone.  It's not a great phone.  I call it the giant iPhone. 
[03:09:30]  It's the Skyrocket.  What?  It's not a good phone.  It's the iPhone killer.  Sam, is it?  Yeah.  He's a shot.  I didn't say it was the iPhone killer.  Oh.  DJ Paulie D. on Twitter.  The Paulie D. Project, like you said a few times here.  Thursday, tomorrow night, 10.30 on MTV.  We'll be watching.  Great.  Thank you.  Come back and see us, brother.  Thanks, guys.  Good luck.  Paulie D., everyone.  Later, Matt.  The Paulie D. and Anthony's show is pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, after ONA Live is next. </pre>
