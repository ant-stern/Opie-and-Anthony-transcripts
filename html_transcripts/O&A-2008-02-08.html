<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly offensive whirlwind of topics, punctuated by frequent interruptions, vulgar language, and bizarre tangents.  The show opened with the hosts declaring their indifference to "niceness" in radio, following a company-wide layoff affecting 400 employees, which resulted in a quieter, less supervised studio environment.  This led to humorous anecdotes about the layoffs, including Opie recounting an embarrassing bowel movement incident and discussing listener emails complaining about unpaid work and job insecurity.  Humorous bits included a discussion of the "Bobs" from *Office Space* and a clip of someone fired for claiming to have "people skills." Opie and Anthony shared their own experiences with firings – Opie’s involved armed security guards, while Anthony’s was a less dramatic dismissal from a bakery job where he frequently slept on the job.  They further discussed the unpleasant realities of various jobs, including those involving animal slaughter.  A listener story about a DJ fired immediately after his last show segued into a discussion of Pedro Martinez and cockfighting, leading to a graphic description of inhumane chicken processing practices, read from a listener's email. The show announced upcoming guests Louis C.K. and Bob Kelly, and played a segment of vulgar and offensive messages from their "FU line." Bob Kelly's distress over the Super Bowl loss was also mentioned.

A subsequent segment began with Opie recounting highlights, including a Larry King rap and a drum performance by Jim Norton.  A Black History Month segment about the Jive Dudes from *Airplane* was followed by crude sexual remarks.  Travis’s wife ("the beard"), Laura Stringfellow, and her two-legged dog, Faith, appeared in studio.  The hosts' reactions to Faith ranged from disgust to morbid fascination.  This segment transitioned to discussion of the upcoming Super Pet Expo featuring Faith and baby tigers. The introduction of "Poop Freeze" led to absurd stunts, resulting in a short circuit and temporary "frostbite" for E-Rock.  The show included political commentary on Mitt Romney’s withdrawal from the presidential race and speculation about John McCain, along with Opie's announcement of his NRA membership.  A lack of station management following the layoffs created a sense of anarchy, further highlighted by a rap battle between Kenny and Roland.  A phone call with Louis C.K. discussed a previous appearance on a Cleveland radio show, where he mistakenly believed he was in Buffalo, and criticized the Cleveland host (“Maxwell”) for a perceived lack of humor and overly restrictive comedic sensibilities.

A heated discussion dominated a later segment, focusing on comedian Maxwell's perceived hypocrisy and "fake radio voice,"  with the hosts replaying audio clips and using highly offensive homophobic and misogynistic slurs. They contrasted Maxwell’s perceived dishonesty with the perceived integrity of Maxwell's co-host, Stansberry. Louis C.K., a guest in studio along with Bob Kelly,  was promoted despite the heated exchange. Bob Kelly was present for a discussion of a Super Bowl play.  The segment concluded with a song from *Team America: World Police*, "Everyone Has AIDS," and further crude language.

Another segment included a nonsensical discussion about a woman drinking at a New Kids on the Block concert, followed by a sound clip of someone being tased.  A significant portion focused on 9/11 conspiracy theories, incorporating a Willie Nelson sound clip and caller submissions.  The discussion included controlled demolition theories, the Pentagon attack, and government involvement.  A "Guess the Singer" segment revealed Crispin Glover, followed by insensitive jokes about Michael J. Fox's Parkinson's disease.  A heated exchange with a Canadian caller, Stuart, providing additional conspiracy theories led to insults and name-calling. The conversation shifted to UFOs, time travel, and alien visitation, concluding with highly insensitive comments about a man with a severe facial tumor shown in a video clip.  The broadcast ended with promotion for Louis C.K. and more irreverent banter.  Throughout this segment, there was pervasive offensive language targeting various groups and individuals.

Finally, a section of the broadcast consisted solely of repeated affirmations of "Yeah," lacking any discernible content.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock job.  Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Imperulus DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock stats, Opie and Anthony.  Shock stats, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  A girl gives you a strip club advice and then you go and see The Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  Your girlfriend did it with you. енная payment is going.  I think if you were touched inappropriately, you would make it like a quick pop song, like the Beatles used to do. 
[00:01:00]  The love, love, me, don't.  Yeah.  You're like, shit, freak!  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed himself.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  On this fine Friday.  Yes, thank God it's Friday.  I like to say that every Friday.  When Black Friday comes.  I just want to make an announcement right off the bat.  I'm officially in charge here in New York City.  What?  This is now my radio station.  Good luck.  Have fun with that one. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Yeah, this radio thing is very, very strange.  It was a bloodbath yesterday.  Yeah, that's what they call it in the corporate world.  A little bit of a bloodbath.  The fine company we work for.  Uh, kind of let a bunch of people go yesterday.  A few cutbacks.  How about 400 people?  Is that what the number was? 
[00:02:30]  400 people nationwide were let go.  And, uh, we came to work this morning wondering who was going to be here.  And, uh, there's not many people here.  Nah, it's sort of, uh, ghost town-ish.  And then, and then the mad scientist, Steve, comes waddling down the hall and pops his head in.  And it was good to see him.  He's been at K-Rock for, I don't know, 40-some-odd years, I think. 
[00:03:00]  100 years.  He's 62.  62, and, oh boy, he looks at today.  He looks at today.  I just want three more years.  Right.  You know, for health insurance, I just...  Oh boy, was he nervous.  We ought to plant stuff in his, like, his bag or something and say he's stolen.  Get him arrested.  Oh my God, no.  We're making jokes, but it was just ugly yesterday.  Everyone's phone was ringing, the emails, the text messages. 
[00:03:30]  Which is, have you heard, have you heard, have you heard phone calls?  And then looking at the list, I'm like, oh my God, I worked with half these people over the years.  Mm-hmm.  So, I don't know, I, you know how we've been saying we have no boss?  We truly, at this point, have no one to answer to.  Yeah.  We could have, like, a bukkake party in here now.  Well, I don't even think you could say that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was one of the words.  Oh, that's one of the words?  It's a fine one, but.  Oh, that's a brilliant line, too. 
[00:04:00]  It is a good one.  And a hot one.  Yeah.  And a damn good idea.  We really can't say that?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Just with the people in the room here.  I was just saying, we could just do some wild things in the studio.  Of course we could.  Like, if we have a problem, I don't even know who we're supposed to, I don't know who we're supposed to call.  Each other.  See, we never, like.  Bounce it off each other.  In our careers, we never really acknowledged PDs.  Mm-hmm.  We kind of worked hand-in-hand with the general managers.  We don't have one of those. 
[00:04:30]  No.  So, I don't know.  Do we go right to corporate?  What do they know?  What do they know?  How to tell people they no longer have jobs, so.  Good point, good point.  You've got to be a little touchy with them.  Good point, good point.  Yeah, but I think they're even nervous at this point.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, even, like, what?  Do you think even the top guy, the head of the company, is nervous because, like, the company itself is just a machine that could fire you?  Well, that's what happened to our boy.  Cyberdyne. 
[00:05:00]  That's what happened to our boy that brought us in.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was pretty much the top of the ladder, and he got the boots.  So, who, like, who are these nameless, faceless people that, like, fire the people that are at the top of the chain?  It's just the machine.  Isn't that scary?  It's the machine.  You would think you get so high up on the corporate pyramid that you're safe.  No.  But then there's somebody, like, higher than you.  Some, like...  But the people that are higher than you aren't out of danger either because they're higher up but somewhere else. 
[00:05:30]  But who are they?  Yeah.  Does it go all the way to the President of the United States?  Backroom people.  Scary.  So, well, we survived this one.  Some of you survive and some of you don't.  Jimmy, you all right?  What happened?  What'd you do?  I just leaned my head back to stretch a little bit, and it hurt.  Were you performing a certain act that usually hurts a guy's neck for hours on end?  Is it the same act that would hurt his father's soul?  No, no. 
[00:06:00]  No.  Dad would be proud.  That one.  That one.  No.  But it usually leaves the back of your neck and your jaw hurting.  I did not.  My girlfriend stayed over last night, and I was very in the mood.  But nature called and said, go sit on the ball for a little while.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, that'll ruin a romantic little moment, won't it?  You know what sucks?  It's funny you say that, because I think it was yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  I took a shower and all that, but before, I did my thing in the bathroom.  And it was a bad one, Jimmy.  It was bad.  And then I took my shower, and then my girl comes into the bathroom.  It was a quick shower, so a mere five minutes after I did my thing, before the shower, she  goes, wow, this bathroom really stinks.  I think we've got to scrub out the shower.  And I'm like, yeah, scrub out the shower, all right.  Did she know?  She's got the smell that lingers long.  Oh, boy, did I. 
[00:07:00]  I don't know.  It was too embarrassing.  I didn't want to ask any more questions.  She thought it was like some kind of mold in the shower.  Mold.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  Hey, stupid Steven S. from Bayshore.  Shut your mouth.  What?  Getting cocky.  He writes, hey, Ope, since you're in charge now, and we are in charge, by the way, how about  K-Rock sends me a check for doing the rundown for the first time since December?  Will you shut up, Steven S.?  You're under the radar, you dope.  They didn't pay him since December? 
[00:07:30]  Under the radar, but he's not getting paid.  That's not being under the radar.  But it's good for him because he's becoming a star with his writing and stuff.  He's got to understand the long-term plan here.  Yeah?  Oh, I wouldn't start bitching about money at this point.  Oh, my God, no.  That's way under the radar.  Yeah, they'd be like, what?  Get rid of him.  It was good to see Kenny in the morning because I wasn't sure if he was going to make it  because I think technically this company pays him a little bit.  Oh, oh, well, he wouldn't care. 
[00:08:00]  He wouldn't care.  No, he wouldn't care because he'd still come pick you up.  Right.  Hi, GH.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing here?  Just taking care of you.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  Hey, guys, do you even still have a dump guy?  Do we have a dump guy?  You know, that's a really good question.  It could be a dangerous move.  I don't think they'd get rid of him.  I say we find out if we have a dump guy.  What?  Let's find out already. 
[00:08:30]  I say we find out we have a dump guy because I really don't know.  Because honestly, we're starting to find out who was fired and who's still here in New  York City.  What was dumped already?  Oh, all right.  So they dumped a word already?  Oh, you guys are lucky because I was going to say fuck.  I was going to say fuck you up.  No.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You get too many back to back and then the problem.  Jesus Christ.  Whoa, Brooklyn Ace.  You didn't have to piggyback mine. 
[00:09:00]  I did the joke.  All right.  So we do have a dump guy.  That's good to know.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You know who they bring in to fire?  You know, the guys at the top of the chain.  They bring in the Bobs from Office Space.  You know, they bring them into a fire room.  The two Bobs.  What are the Bobs, Anthony?  You know, I got to be honest.  Anthony references Office Space a lot on this show and I'm out.  I tried to watch that movie a couple times and I couldn't get through it.  Oh, it's a good one. 
[00:09:30]  I got to try again, obviously, but who are the Bobs?  The Bobs are the consultants that come in and consult the company.  They're insulting.  Thank you.  Yes.  And they let them know, you know, who's doing the job, who maybe has jobs that are redundant  and give suggestions on who should be let go.  They're the people that come in and fire people.  That's pretty much it.  And they sit down and interview with people and they realize during the course of the 
[00:10:00]  interviews, by listening to the guy's answers, it's like, oh my God, he's so fired.  He doesn't even know what he does.  We hate consultants.  I love the two Bobs.  We absolutely hate consultants.  I'm a people person.  Yeah.  I think we got a Bob.  That's one of the answers.  Yeah.  We have a Bob clip.  We find it's always better to fire people on a Friday.  Studies have statistically shown that there's less chance of an incident if you do it at  the end of the week.  That's true, too.  They really do it that way, too.  I'm surprised they did it yesterday because now it makes the papers and makes all the websites. 
[00:10:30]  Usually they do it on Friday because no one really reads the papers as much on a Saturday  or hit the business websites on a Saturday.  They take a little break from all that.  So then it goes under the radar and then Monday comes and you don't even know people were fired.  Naga.  Naga.  Wow.  You have that one?  Oh, the people person.  Naga.  Well, not going to work here no more.  Which one do you have?  People skills.  All right.  Let's hear this. 
[00:11:00]  What would you say you do here?  Well, look, I already told you.  I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to.  I have people skills.  I am good at dealing with people.  Can't you understand that?  What the hell is wrong with you people?  It's a great way to just get fired.  Yeah.  They typically fire people, too.  Like in situations where they don't know, they say never fire them out of your office.  Because people typically, shooters, will come back. 
[00:11:30]  Jeez.  That's what they say, to where they were fired.  A lot of times they turn them to a conference room, which is why a lot of firing is done in conference rooms.  So they don't come to the boss's office and look for him on the rifle.  That way they'll just shoot some poor people that are in there for lunch.  Yeah, exactly.  Somebody eating a tuna salad.  And then they, I think they said before vacation sometimes, too, because then the normalcy of getting up, you don't miss it.  Like you have a whole week where you weren't supposed to get up.  My greatest firing ever was when I was working in Buffalo, and we had no clue. 
[00:12:00]  We heard there was a big meeting on Monday, and it was a long, actually on a Tuesday, because it was one of those long holiday weekends where you had Monday off.  And we come back in Tuesday.  All weekend, we're like, God, what do you think is happening?  You think they're going to pump money into the station or tweak it a little bit or hire a big morning show, right?  So we go into this conference room, and they close the doors, and there's a bunch of guys that we've never seen before.  And they turn out to be the, like you were saying earlier, Ant, the big, big guys.  Yeah, the big guys.  And they didn't even like sugarcoat it. 
[00:12:30]  They're like, we are letting everybody go, and the station is being sold to the competition.  Bye.  And then the shock on everyone's face is we had no clue it was coming.  So then they're like, you guys got, I think they said less than an hour to get out of this building.  I mean, they were like hardcore.  Pack your crap and leave.  And I've told the story many times.  So as just a kid just kind of starting my radio career, I went right for the prize closet because it was changing formats, and the competition was taking it over.  I'm like, screw the competition. 
[00:13:00]  And I loaded up my Honda with just box sets and CDs of everything we were playing.  Nice.  I can't remember everything, but oh, yeah, absolutely.  And then I remember the PD, because I was wandering around as much as you can before you had to be out of this building.  I remember the PD walking into his office and attempting to get stuff from his computer.  There was a guy in there that was armed.  Really?  And tapped his gun and said, I wouldn't do that if I was you. 
[00:13:30]  Like he would shoot him?  Well, they were making a statement, though.  There were armed guards in this building, and the PD had, you know, they were allowing you basically to stay there for an hour just to get your personal belongings.  But as far as this was when radio was way more competitive than it is now, and they didn't want this PD to go into his computer to get all his, like, you know, files and all his research and all this stuff that, you know, helps with the radio station.  And the guy just taps his gun and goes, I wouldn't do that if I was you.  Stupid security troll.  Huh? 
[00:14:00]  The stupid security troll.  What does he think?  He's going to shoot the gun.  I think he better look over his Use of Deadly Physical Force book and see what's allowed.  Yeah, but this guy was just a dopey PD.  We're just dopey jocks.  So obviously just a tap of the gun.  You're not going to be, you know, questioning anything.  You know, and they knew that.  And I don't know if it was just a dopey security guy.  I think it was, like, some retired, you know, police guys and stuff.  Drop the Creedence Clearwater Revival CD. 
[00:14:30]  Drop it!  Why did you shoot him?  He was attempting to log on with C-Prompt.  You have a good firing story, Ann, or?  Oh, my most embarrassing one was I was working at a place, I guess they had since changed  the name.  It was Dan's Bakery out there in Central Islip on Long Island.  As a kid, my uncle got me the job because he was the supervisor over there.  And I was the worst. 
[00:15:00]  I was the worst.  I'd come in.  I was supposed to work Saturday because I was still going to school at the time.  And I was, of course, you know, hungover from Friday night.  And I would just kind of go in the back and sleep.  And he knew that.  And occasionally I would push a broom around to clean up because there's dough and sesame  seeds all over the place.  It's a bread factory.  And after so long of me doing this, my uncle just came up to me one day and woke me up.  I was laying down on the desk and he goes, why don't you just go home? 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And I was like, oh, okay.  I was kind of psyched because I was tired.  Wait, you were sleeping at the desk and he just taps you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was like, Anthony, why don't you just go home?  I was like, oh, okay.  So I left.  How psyched were you?  I was so psyched because I was tired and I wanted to go to bed and everything.  So I went home, went to bed and then my mother comes in after a while and she's like, you  know, you got fired today.  I was like, no, your uncle Tony sent me home. 
[00:16:00]  And it was your uncle.  Yeah.  He knew I was, you know, lazy bastard.  He goes, my mother goes, no, you weren't just sent home for the day.  You were fired because you're too stupid to even realize you got fired.  She goes, what were you doing?  And I go, oh, I guess I was sleeping.  So then it was so hard to like go over family functions and stuff because I had to like  look at my uncle and know he fired me and it was kind of awkward. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, it's cool now.  You know, I love the guy.  He's great.  Which uncle?  Uncle Tony.  Wait.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Why did he fire you though?  He could have given you a warning.  I think he did a few times.  I was just the worst.  I was the worst employee when it came to working, like physical work.  I just didn't like it.  I wanted something better.  But who does like it though?  There are people, when I was working in air conditioning, HVAC as they call it, there 
[00:17:00]  were guys that enjoyed the job.  They'd wake up in the morning like, ah, the brisk air.  It's a nice day of work.  Let's suit up and get up in there.  And I'm like, you kidding me?  You enjoy, you like this crap?  That's very rare though, I would assume.  Yeah.  Unless they would just kind of rationalize it in their own heads, you know, going like,  oh, my life sucks and I'm doing this.  And, you know, not to knock any of the tin knackers out there, but I don't know how many  actually like their job. 
[00:17:30]  I know I hated it.  Let's work in the freezing cold with what amounts to giant razor blades all day long.  This is nice.  Ow, I cut myself again.  Duct tape.  Back to work.  But when it's cold, you know, the blood like kind of freezes up on you.  It did.  So it doesn't have to pour out as much.  And it's nice that the material that you work with 99% of the time is 20 degrees colder  than the outside air, no matter what it is.  You ever try to pick up a piece of metal in freezing cold weather?  No.  And it's like, oh, wear gloves.  Well, you can't because you're trying to, out of your little tool apron, you're trying 
[00:18:00]  to pick out little drill screws, so you can't even wear gloves.  And fingerless gloves do nothing.  I love the fingerless glove thing.  For whoever that works for, God bless you, because what gets cold on me are my fingers.  It's not like my hands, my palms.  Oh, my palms are freezing.  It's always your fingertips that you whack with a hammer in the cold weather.  Oh, I do not miss it.  Do not miss it.  John, I'm Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good, John. 
[00:18:30]  Okay.  Listen, I got a firing story.  When I used to live down in Memphis, okay?  Rick Nees had this record, Disco Duck.  Yeah, of course.  He should have been fired for that, by the way.  He should have been killed for that.  Yeah.  Song stunk.  He was a disc jockey at the time, right?  He made this big promo of going on tour for two months.  Yeah.  Right?  And the day that he signed off to go for the two-month tour, they fired him right after  his show.  Well, that's how it's done, man. 
[00:19:00]  That's what sucks about doing a radio show.  You never know when your last show is.  They never do the right thing and go, guys, you know, today's the day you got to say goodbye.  You just sign off and hope you get to come back the next day.  It's the weirdest business ever.  I still love it, but it's just so stupid.  No, I upset Chris there a little bit.  Which one?  Uh, New York, Chris, down there, yeah.  Hey, Chris. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  I'm on my way into work right now.  I work for Local 30.  I'm a Tim Knocker.  I just want to thank Anthony for crushing my dreams.  See, now, don't get me wrong, Chris.  I understand where you're coming from because I would drive in and I would listen to the radio  and I wanted to do radio.  I didn't want to knock Tim.  And then, um, one day, I guess it was, I guess it was Howard's show.  He said something like, uh, he took a call from a Tim Knocker and the guy was bashing, 
[00:20:00]  uh, Howie about something.  And Howard goes, well, what do you do?  He goes, I'm a Tim Knocker.  He goes, Tim Knocker.  And he just started slamming Tim Knockers.  And I was driving, I was driving my van and I'm a Tim Knocker at the time and I'm just  going like, oh boy, I'm a Tim Knocker and this sucks and I'd rather be doing radio.  And, uh, you know, look at what happened.  See, Chris, it could happen for you too.  And we got Howard back many, many ways, by the way.  Yes.  So, exactly. 
[00:20:30]  So F you, Howard.  I just, I just do it to work from weekend to weekend because I'm a musician also.  So it's funny hearing you tell your stories about how you would just go, you know, from,  you know, from weekend to weekend.  And these guys, you know, they bust my chops all the time, but, you know, I'm just keeping  my head down, just waiting for that loose record contract.  Yeah.  Aren't there old timers working there though, that like enjoy the job?  Some that enjoy the job.  And then there's some that just look at me with that look and they're just like, why  are you doing this? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  To eat.  Like they tell me every day, they're like, go back to school, go back to school, go back  to school.  All right.  All right, Chris.  Thank you, man.  Don't cut yourself.  I'm going to put you in a uterus.  Then you're longer.  And now we got people on the line.  They think they're getting fired today.  We'll have to talk to them after the break.  There were a lot of rumors flying around yesterday that we got fired, by the way.  Yeah.  From some pretty big sources.  They were calling me going, hey, is it true? 
[00:21:30]  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  And it came and I swear I'm not making anything up from the hallways of Sirius Satellite Radio.  They were all excited.  Oh.  Pretty much ready to throw a party over there.  Prematurely.  Yeah.  And this person who contacted a person that I know very well.  He said, look, this guy usually never gets involved with the rumors.  So when he's calling, it's usually pretty good.  Well, it is Friday and they do suggest you fire people on Friday. 
[00:22:00]  So we might not be out of the woods yet.  But he said the hallways, they were celebrating because they really thought that we were done.  Sorry.  That's just wonderful as we attempt to possibly work side-by-side with those guys someday.  Sorry, Chief.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The phone's lit.  But if you want to try to get in a little later this morning, 877-212-ON-A.  Grammys right around the corner.  We've got a Grammy moment, a Grammy minute.  I don't know.  Whatever it's called.  Right here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute. 
[00:22:30]  Song of the Year.  Rehab.  Amy Winehouse.  They try to take a go to rehab.  I said, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black.  But when I come back, you won't know, no, no.  I ain't got the time.  If my daddy thinks I'm fine.  He's trying to take me to go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go. 
[00:23:00]  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  Yo, shove it.  Take this job and shove it.  Take the job and shove it.  I ain't working in no more.  Take the job and shove it.  Yo, shove it.  Take this job and shove it.  Take the job.  Take the job.  Take the job and shove it.  Explain that for everybody that got fired yesterday.  They're out there.  They're listening. 
[00:23:30]  It sucks.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're officially in charge here in New York City.  For now.  Who said that back in the day?  Alexander Haig was it?  Alexander Haig.  Yes.  One of the most.  When Reagan got shot.  And he didn't even consult with anyone.  He just got up in front of the media and said, well, I'm in charge here.  Yeah, they asked, who's in charge of the White House?  And Al Haig went, I am. 
[00:24:00]  I'm the honcho.  And what was he back then?  He was the secretary of the House or no?  No, no.  He was secretary of defense.  Secretary of defense.  Okay.  So he was just like kind of.  Yeah, he didn't consult with anybody.  He just said, look, I'm in charge.  But is it supposed to be president, vice president?  Oh, yeah.  That's what made it so funny.  And the vice president was out.  That was Bush.  Yeah.  So if he could do it.  And man, I mean, that's the White House.  And we're officially telling people we're in charge.  We want to change the call letters.  Let's go with W-O-N-A.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:24:30]  W-O-N-A.  N-A, yes.  Linger longer.  But we truly want to change the call letters right off the bat.  You all right?  What are you doing picking your teeth like that, Jimmy?  I got a piece of apple.  It's hurting me.  Oh.  Sorry.  Apples can be treacherous.  I just put a piece of apple in it.  And whatever it is is in there in my gum.  It's just...  A little piece of the apple skin shoves up between your teeth and hits your gum and just...  And that makes you hate apples.  And I'm such a pal, I have to, like, point it out to everybody.  And I'm trying to discreetly dig in between my teeth.  With a full page of paper, though.  Maybe rip a little piece off, Jimmy. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, really.  Jimmy's got, like, a full page.  He picked up the whole phone book, Jimmy.  I mean, we had to acknowledge it.  See, exaggerated humor.  I'm a big fan.  So, wow.  Lots going on.  I mean, we talked about the situation here in New York.  But, you know, F the Daily News, man.  They pretty much just destroyed the mafia yesterday.  They arrested everybody.  And, boy, that's a real brave picture to put on your cover, knowing that the mafia can't do anything about it. 
[00:25:30]  They got this guy.  He's huge.  And he's got a big butt.  And he's got slacks on.  And it's not a flattering picture.  It's on the front page of the Daily News.  And the guy's chained all the way around his chest.  Yeah.  And they're bringing him in with a lot of other mafia bigwigs.  I like how they chain him.  Where's this guy running off to?  Right.  Well, there's the Daily News.  Real brave.  I like how.  Well, the Daily News isn't all that brave. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Look, they put the photographer's name right there.  Oh, they did?  Robert Sabo.  Right.  Godspeed there, Bobby.  Bobby Sabo.  That's an insulting picture.  It shows a lack of respect.  It's just a picture of this guy's posterior.  Yes.  Yeah.  I don't even want to say fat ass.  Are you crazy?  There's still guys out there.  Jimmy.  That's probably his nickname.  Oh, big sweep on the Gambinos.  I love the nicknames, by the way.  I don't care.  And they all have them. 
[00:26:30]  It's really fun to look at.  Like Jackie D'Amico, 71.  Or John D'Amico.  He's called Jackie Knows.  Hey, where's Jackie Knows?  Jackie Knows got arrested.  Dominico Cefalu, 61.  His nickname is The Grease Ball.  Hey, The Grease Ball.  Joseph Jojo Carrazzo.  Very clever names. 
[00:27:00]  And then one of them is Fats.  And then another one's Skinny.  So I'm not sure who's fat.  The Skinny Guy, they call him Fats?  Because that's kind of funny.  And the Fat Guy, they call him Skinny?  I think Skinny Guy is Fats.  Yeah, they do it that way, like to make it funny.  Or they just do it literal and call the Fat Guy Fats.  Because remember, we met Tiny when we did our Buffalo beach party there.  Tiny was huge.  Tiny was a seven-foot white guy.  Throughout history, always funny.  And he weighed close to 400 pounds and no fat on him. 
[00:27:30]  And they called him Tiny because of that.  Anyway, in other news, then you go to the back of the paper today.  No, it's the Post.  Oh, my God, the Post.  And this Brian, what's his name, McNamee?  Yep.  Ugh, what a creep.  What a weirdo.  The Roger Clemens thing.  I'm not a big Roger Clemens fan, but, man, he got set up eight years ago, right?  Eight years.  This guy's been saving little scraps of Roger's ass-cheek blood. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, people know the story by now.  The whole steroid, human growth hormone thing.  Brian McNamee saved the needles, the gauze, and little plastic baggies.  What a creep.  And the back page of the Post today, it says, Rocket's trainer.  This went there.  And they have a picture of Roger on the mound in his Yankee uniform, kind of bending down.  Bending down for the rosin bag, perhaps.  Or fixing his lace or something.  And then they superimpose another picture of a needle going into his butt. 
[00:28:30]  But it would be about a three-foot-long needle.  Yeah.  They didn't do it to scale.  Yeah.  This is the newspaper, by the way.  Yeah, they love their Photoshop.  Yeah, they're Photoshopping with the newspaper.  They have a lot of fun with their Photoshop.  What do you think of this Brian McNamee, though?  He's a scum.  Bucket?  No.  I know what you want to say.  Why can't you say that?  Well, we can say it.  Just say it.  He's a scum. 
[00:29:00]  Say it.  No, I won't say it.  The guy's a douche.  Losing the show.  He's kind of like a vulture-ish.  Yeah.  That's really creepy.  Yeah.  So now, do they got Roger Lyon officially?  I mean, could Roger Clemens go to jail for this now?  Because I was reading some of this stuff really fast.  They said all Roger has to do is go, look, I didn't know what he was injecting.  I didn't know he was injecting me with steroids.  I thought it was a B12 shot.  That's what he said.  He fessed up to the fact that he did get injected with B12. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  But this guy's saying there were traces of steroid in the syringe and some of his blood,  which through DNA you can check on.  But who's to tell if he didn't put some growth hormone in there, dip it in?  You know, who knows?  This isn't evidence that could really be used in any way.  It's tainted evidence.  I mean, it can't be used to convict somebody.  I think all they could, can they even get him on perjury at this point?  I don't know.  Did he testify?  I don't know.  We got to read a little more on this one. 
[00:30:00]  But Kenny, what do you got?  Just a little fun fact.  You can't save evidence of that type in plastic because of moisture with liquid.  Really?  Yeah.  So it's probably no good after all these years.  But everyone's saying it is good, Kenny.  You can't save evidence.  Because it's the DNA stuff.  Oh, you can't save evidence?  You can't save liquid evidence in plastic because of moisture.  But they're not even worried about the liquid part of it.  They're worried about the DNA actually on the needle.  Right.  Which is there.  Bottom line is, how about if we use DNA technology to free people who are convicted of crimes they 
[00:30:30]  didn't commit?  Yeah, who cares?  Who really does care if Roger Clemens did steroids?  Or anyone else?  They didn't do.  Yeah.  I don't give a crap.  But we love the Roger Clemens thing that we play from time to time.  We'll get one more play out of it.  Yeah.  Roger Clemens admitting the steroid thing.  And I don't know why ESPN is not going with this audio.  Maybe because it's fake?  What?  Oh.  I want to say thanks to this Mitchell report. 
[00:31:00]  I've been getting emails and questions on this subject.  And now the whole world knows the answer is that I use steroids.  Over the last 15 days or so, when I played in Toronto for the Blue Jays, Brian McNamee used  steroids to inject into my body.  And I'm very thankful for those steroids.  And it's been extremely difficult to do this.  I'm almost numb to steroids and human growth hormones.  I'm angry about it, to be honest with you.  It's hurtful to have thousands of people to inject human growth hormone into my body. 
[00:31:30]  My friends inject steroids into my body.  The New York Yankees inject human growth hormone into my body.  My children use drugs and it means a lot to me.  In my family, to inject steroids.  Again, it's amazing to me that I have to even use steroids.  I want to say thanks to Brian McNamee, the New York Yankees.  After Christmas, I'm going to sit down with Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes and I'll inject drugs 
[00:32:00]  into my body.  Right there in front of him and we'll do all this again.  And let me be clear that I'm very thankful for those steroids.  And Mike Wallace used drugs now that that's come out.  My children inject steroids into Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes.  But we're coming upon Christmas now and I have been blessed in my life.  I've been blessed in my career.  And the answer is that I use steroids.  That's my favorite part.  The fact that his children are injecting Mike Wallace.  With steroids.  Everything up until then was feasible. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Let's go to Shane in the Bronx, NYPD.  What's up, Shane?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you, Shane?  Good, good.  Met your sister a few weeks ago at FH Riley's.  Leave her alone.  No, she's a very, very sweet girl.  Yeah.  Any type of serological or biological evidence has to be stored in a paper bag, as Kenny said.  So it's no moisture or anything that's caught on it.  And then if it's put in plastic, it won't be admissible in court because of cross-contamination. 
[00:33:00]  I like storing blood evidence on my knuckles.  I give shampoos.  All right, Shane.  I heard about you, too.  I heard you had a good time at FH.  All right, well.  I didn't want to elaborate.  I feel awkward.  I was trying to sneak a plug in there.  I saw that.  Pedro Martinez, keeping with the sports thing.  And good for him.  He's defending going to a cockfight in the Dominican Republic. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  I think TMZ's got the video.  A lot of places have the video, but they refuse to show the actual cockfighting.  Yeah, they won't show it because it's cruel to the little animals.  And people get disturbed when they see chickens fighting.  The story goes...  I don't see any animals really fight.  I think that's a spectacle of the olden days.  You think?  Yeah, people don't really like seeing animals fight anymore.  I love when a couple... 
[00:34:00]  Not to the point of death, of course, but I love when a couple of people are walking  their dogs and their dogs just go at it with each other.  Doing that whole...  Around the neck and saliva's flying.  Because the owners freak out.  Oh, my God.  They're trying to pull away.  You know what, though?  Great stuff.  It's always one of those little effers.  Those little, tiny, little...  Yappy dogs?  Yep.  Yip-yip dogs.  I like the...  Thinking they got balls of steel.  They're this big.  They're good mid-sized dogs.  A couple of mid-sized, like Labradors or Goldies or something like that going at each 
[00:34:30]  other.  They grab on the neck and swoop in their head around.  It's good stuff.  The yip-yips, though.  Yeah.  They're the ones that think they're tough.  They nip.  Look out.  He nips.  Does he?  It's called biting, and if he does it, he's flying 50 yards.  Yeah.  I was on the elevator in my building, and a guy had a dog who always snaps at people,  but he holds it pretty tight, but he laughs about it.  Like, it's a cute little...  Aw.  Like, it's not a personality trait your dog has. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  You have an awful dog, sir.  Yeah.  If it was bigger, it would have to be put to sleep.  Right.  Dummy.  If it was smaller, I would have hit it.  But it was right there in the middle where it could kind of hurt me, so I was just kind  of like, well, you better be careful, fella.  So, Peter's outraged that Pedro Martinez, it's the off-season, and he's hanging out in the  Dominican Republic, and he went to a cockfight.  And know why he went to a cockfight?  Because it's very, very, very, very, very popular down there.  And very, very, very, very, very legal, by the way, as well.  Yeah.  It's like a national sport.  And he's defending it. 
[00:35:30]  Which, you know, God bless Pedro Martinez for defending it.  Mm-hmm.  Why not?  It's what people do in their own countries.  We're a little pompous to think we could take our little morality and go around the globe.  Like, Mexico's got their bullfighting.  Right.  Occasionally, we try to go down there and tell them to stop.  It is just a horribly cruel thing to do, but who the hell are we to say?  I don't care.  I don't care what they do down there.  You know what they used to do here in New York City and across America back in the day?  According to my fine rat book. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, your rat book.  I'm getting there.  I'm almost done, and I'll stop talking about rats.  Bet on rat races?  No, they had rat fights in pits, in bars.  They would set up these bars, and they would have a pit in the middle of it, I guess.  This is when you still had, like, I guess, dirt floors.  And they got five points?  You could dig holes.  Lower Manhattan, where they first settled here in New York City.  And they would put, I don't know, like 50 to 100 rats in one of these pits, and then  they would put a dog in there.  And then they would bet on how many rats the dog would kill. 
[00:36:30]  Because the dogs, I guess, would just go nuts for the rats, especially because the rats  are now in a major panic.  They had some kind of chute that let the rats in, so they couldn't get back out.  And then all hell would break loose, and the bedding that was going on.  It was a huge, huge thing.  Wait, would the rats ever kill the dog or no?  Uh, I believe so, yeah.  Oh, yeah, dogs would be killed.  Absolutely.  But then the dog would have status because, oh, wow, that's the dog that, you know, killed  50 of them, 60 of them, whatever.  And it was just a great thing to do. 
[00:37:00]  You went to these bars, you drank, you bet, and you watched this crazy thing going on.  And they stopped that.  Rats aren't animals.  They're not?  No, let the rat fighting at least continue.  I would love to see something like that.  There was footage not long ago of a filmmaker who was like, he's Japanese or something,  but he actually filmed this for his movie where a cat ran into a room full of rats, and  they swarmed the cat.  It was really creepy, uncomfortable footage to look at.  The rats are just nasty.  You'll never get rid of them. 
[00:37:30]  But the point we're making today, you know, yeah, Anthony, you know, in this country,  we're all a bunch of goody-two-shoes, and we'd think, oh, God, I can't believe they're  cockfighting.  Do you know what they do to chickens?  We all love our chicken, right?  Yeah.  And just as we were reading this story, by the way, there was a commercial for a very  popular chicken company.  Let's not say it.  It might be a sponsor.  Why not?  Well, it doesn't matter at this point.  And then the guy is just kind of like displaying like a chicken carcass, basically. 
[00:38:00]  A cutlet and a leg.  And he's having fun with it.  Yeah.  He's going off this chicken thing.  And that used to be a thing with a soul, even though they say animals don't have souls,  but they do have souls.  Living little animal.  We justified the fact that we had to eat animals by saying, hey, they have no souls.  Yeah.  Now we can eat them.  Only the simians have the divine spot.  Yeah.  Keep believing that animals don't have souls.  All right.  But this is what we do to chickens here in the... 
[00:38:30]  Tell us, bright eyes.  This is what we do to chickens here in America.  You might want to punch out because this is pretty gross.  Oh, nice.  First time we've said that in a while.  But this is pretty horrific stuff.  But you got to play it because, you know, oh, I can't believe they're doing this in the  Dominican Republic.  Really?  Well, this is what they do at a fine processing plant.  That's what they do here by the millions.  Let's say billions, probably.  The day I started, one worker picked up shackled birds and punched them in the necks. 
[00:39:00]  I guess he was bored or thought it was fun.  The same day, another guy told me how he broke a bird's back with his knee, and then he broke  her legs after shackling her.  I can tell this is going to be a horrific investigation.  At this plant, about 50,000 birds were shackled and slaughtered every day.  Day after day, workers would carelessly grab birds from coops and slam their weak legs  into shackles.  It's a violent process.  The birds are scared and flapping their legs often break.  Live birds often get caught in their coops. 
[00:39:30]  Once when a bird's leg got caught, one worker just ripped it right off of her body.  Oh, by the way, we're not working for Peter.  The point I'm making is you can't start pointing fingers at what they're doing in the  Dominican Republic with the cockfighting.  When this horrific thing is going on around us constantly.  Nothing beats barbecued chicken.  I love my chicken, and whatever they have to do to get it on my plate, I'm all for.  But let's not start pointing fingers going, they're out of control.  Make them smoke little firecracker cigars. 
[00:40:00]  I don't care.  As long as it gets on my table.  Coke Logic animated Jimmy's bit on the chicken factory.  Oh, my God.  If you haven't seen that yet, I think it's still up on onaradio.com.  Maybe Steven S. for Bayshore could add that to the rundown today.  The death assembly line where the chickens just don't understand what's happening.  They just stand there all stupid.  The slaughterhouse.  It continues.  I frequently saw live birds being slammed against the metal bars of the transport trucks  and the coops and even into the concrete walls. 
[00:40:30]  One day, one of the workers swung a bird like a baseball bat into the handrail of the staircase.  The bird's spine was exposed and there was blood everywhere.  This guy just laughed about it.  Workers like to play this sick game where they throw carcasses of dead birds that they're still alive.  These birds were terrified and confused.  One day, a worker was haunting another worker by holding a bird by the legs and jerking her back and forth toward him.  The second guy just grabbed the bird and punched her. 
[00:41:00]  So, the problem isn't really with the process.  It's with who they're hiring to do this crap.  They sound like they just really love shenanigans with these chickens.  They're just brutal people, man.  Yeah, yeah.  They're brutal people.  There's a way to do it humanely.  If you're going to kill somebody, eat it.  There's a way to do it where you can at least make the animal's life a little more comfortable.  They hire a bunch of Percy from Green Mile.  A bunch of little Percys. 
[00:41:30]  There's no reason to swing a chicken by its legs unless you're do-si-do-ing.  Then the chicken understands.  Swing your chicken round and round.  Here's the last clip.  Workers are told never to go underneath the trucks the birds arrive on for any reason at all,  even if live birds fall down there.  We're told that if we hear a loud popping sound, it's just a bird being squished under a tire.  This happens frequently.  Remains of dead birds are scattered around from being run over. 
[00:42:00]  Workers would regularly punch and kick birds.  One guy humped a shackled turkey one day,  and another time another worker was putting his fingers in a...  which is basically her...  while the line was stopped.  The workers at this plant were clearly not trained in animal welfare.  Some workers even bragged about their abuse.  It's got to be, you know...  They've got to get the dregs of society,  just brutal people that enjoy killing things.  These would be serial killers.  Yeah.  They just enjoy killing animals. 
[00:42:30]  That's how it usually starts, you know?  Amazing, right?  On just a huge scale, too.  It's mass, mass murder.  It's murder.  They hung him upside down, Sam.  His little throat got cut.  It was murder.  Gypsy!  Gypsy's here.  He was cluck, cluck, clucking until the very end, Sam. 
[00:43:00]  Do an autopsy on a chicken.  Get me some salt and pepper, Sam.  There's cocaine on the beak.  Bruce in Louisiana, what's up?  Jack Klugman got married, by the way.  Did he?  Yes.  He married his long-time assistant, I think, of 20 years.  And, yeah, they're married now.  Oh.  Yeah.  How much older is he than her?  A lot, from the picture I saw.  Yeah, he's doing all right for himself, I gather. 
[00:43:30]  He was married to, um, oh, what the hell's her name?  From Match Game.  Match Game.  Brett Summers.  And, uh, they separated in, like, 1974, but never got a divorce.  Never got divorced.  And then she just recently died, and he gets married.  Why didn't he just get it?  It seems like he was waiting for her to die before he got remarried.  Who knows?  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana, but...  Would you marry me?  Must have sounded romantic.  Funny, she dumped him in the 70s or whatever, right when the odd couple was a big hit. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Let's move, Brett.  What, did she marry him during the Twilight Zone?  She thought her career was going to take her.  Pip!  Bruce, go ahead.  Yeah, anyway, um, I used to haul chickens, uh, out of Arkansas, and, uh, when you go in  there, they have a bunch of Mexicans, they go in these big holding pens, they just pick  them up there, all the chickens are on the floor, and the Mexicans just go in there and  pick them up by the head and swing them around until their neck breaks, throw them back on  the floor.  And then after all the chickens in the holding pen are dead, then you come in and you pick 
[00:44:30]  them up and you take them over to the processing.  And that's, that's the actual, I would, I would say like, not in this, I guess, legal way  to do it, like the way that they just do it.  Yeah, it's just gotta be absolutely brutal.  It's ridiculous.  It's the, I went and watched, yeah, I'm not really watched, but I was just being nosy.  And it's one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen for just people to walk through  a, a floor literally covered with chickens.  You couldn't even walk and they just reach down and pick them up by the neck, swing them 
[00:45:00]  around three or four times by the neck and throw them back down.  You know, I was watching footage, like people that don't like to watch this stuff.  It's like, like I was watching fur footage from, uh, I think it was China or somewhere  where, where they, uh, they skin the, like they take an animal and they grab by the legs  and they bash its head into the ground and they kind of skin it alive and just throw the  animal into a pile of animals.  And then the, the, the undercover camera zoomed in and it's like, eyes are blinking.  Oh, it's like, ow, ow, this really hurts.  Really awful.  What are they, what are they then sprinkle salt all over the pile? 
[00:45:30]  It's just horrible people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's the vinegar?  Oh, it's coming up.  There's really, um, I guess, is there a, a more, um, it's probably the most economical  way they have of doing this.  Sure.  I can't really see how they could lull them to sleep or, or anything.  They really, it's, they're in the business of killing massive amounts of animals to feed  the country.  So what are they supposed to do? 
[00:46:00]  Is there, I don't know.  Cheaper.  You know what?  It probably costs too much.  A little bit more, but how much more is it going to cost to like, like you get two of  the chickens friends and like Pesci and Goodfellas, you have them walk him into a place and he  goes, ah, but he needs two chicken friends with him.  Yeah.  You gotta have two chicken friends to lead him in there.  Always.  So he's comforted.  All right.  We can continue with this.  Hey, uh, let's, uh, forget, let's not forget that we got live animals coming into the studio  today.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  Yes.  So we're talking about animals.  Oh my God.  We did this last year.  Tiger cubs.  I love little tiger cubs.  From the, uh, super pet expo at seven o'clock.  That's minutes away.  Every time we've had tigers in the studio, which is twice, I think, um, I have been injured.  By the tiger?  Yes.  I remember last year.  Both times.  It swiped your neck, I think?  Yeah.  It got my neck and my, uh, shoulder.  Nice.  And, uh, part of my chest, which kind of really looked cool, even though it was a little,  little tiger.  It was like, I had these cool tiger scratch marks down my, uh, you should have made it 
[00:47:00]  into a tattoo.  Yeah, man.  Oh my.  And then the other time he grabbed my ankle.  What?  What happened, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  You said tattoo.  Someone sent me a picture.  They got my name tattooed on them.  My autograph.  People crazy?  Tattooed.  Sorry.  I just remembered that as you said that.  It was very weird.  Insane.  Uh, yeah.  Remember we had the tiger cubs at NEW?  We got to, uh.  Yeah.  They were cool, but they are ferocious, man.  Even when they're small.  When they're little, they got these huge paws and their claws are very sharp.  All right.  And they love playing. 
[00:47:30]  We'll do about two minutes with the tigers.  No, I want to pet them.  Because, uh, you know, it's going to be boring for everybody.  The tigers.  Also, we got Louis C.K. coming in to promote some stuff.  And I guess that stupid show in Cleveland, like, uh, went after Louis C.K.  Maxwell?  Yeah.  The dope that says, and punt.  And punt.  Just the poser.  And the thing that bothers me about Maxwell, the curse he has is, like, when we would fight  with JV and Elvis for that brief time, you couldn't say that they weren't funny guys  or that they didn't have a show that was entertaining. 
[00:48:00]  But he's just not a funny dude.  No.  He doesn't have the gift of being funny.  He's awful.  He's a fat man with a breathing apparatus.  He's absolutely awful.  We'll get into that a little bit.  That dumb show's on our radar today.  So we'll slap them around and throw them back into obscurity.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's go to the FU line and see what you guys are bitching about today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have seven new voice messages. 
[00:48:30]  First voice message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big FU to my FU boss.  Thanks for only giving me a 50 cent raise after a year and a half.  I hope you go bankrupt.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big FU to a guy I work with.  Alan, you're a f*****.  Everybody knows it.  You're ugly.  You smell funny.  No one can stand you.  Please stop waking up in the morning.  F***** you.  Next message.  I want to send a big FU out to our co-worker, Timmy, for being such a short little bitch. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, Timmy, f***** you.  Next message.  Hey, it's Rob in the guts.  I want to leave a big FU to Sandy, the girl that I picked up at the bar, hung out with her for a couple of weeks.  She liked s**t, gave me great s**t, and then just blows me off.  What's up with that?  FU, Sandy.  Next message.  Hey, this is Mike in Stockton, and I want to give a big f***** you to all the hookers on Craigslist to try to pull the bait and switch.  I'm not going to f***** you if you don't look like you do in your picture. 
[00:49:30]  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big f***** you to my neighbor, who keeps calling the police, and have my car towed.  Hey, man, I can park my f***** car anywhere I want, so f***** you.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a big f***** you to my girlfriend's f***** daughter.  Get the f***** out of the house and get super-aged, you bitch.  Next message.  Yeah, I gotta say f***** you to Jack Daniels, you son of a bitch. 
[00:50:00]  I punched my mother.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  I am so psyched.  I'm not.  Why?  We got Tiger Cubs.  Well, I thought we had Tiger Cubs.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Phone number 877-212-O&A. 
[00:50:30]  Louis C.K.  Coming in studio today.  I think stupid Bob Kelly's coming by, too.  I had a real moment with him on the phone yesterday, and I told him he has to come by.  He was explaining how much this Super Bowl loss is hurting him.  Really?  And it was amazing to listen to him.  Yeah.  He was not joking, and I felt like I can't beat him up for it.  And I said, you really got to come in and retell this on the air.  You can't beat him up for it.  I'll tell you why.  Well, we will, but I want to get that real moment, because he's dead serious how hard 
[00:51:00]  he took this.  And he didn't even see the big play that Manning made and that crazy catch with the helmet.  I was explaining the play to him yesterday on the phone.  I'm like, Bob, this happened, what, five days ago at this point?  He goes, well, what happened?  He's finally willing to hear what happened.  I'm like, I mean, that's how obsessed he is with the Pats.  He's obsessed with the Pats because they were everything he isn't.  They were, like, perfect.  They were driven.  They were his identity.  He was Bob, the Patriots fan. 
[00:51:30]  But you know what, Bob?  You're not the 18-0.  Yeah.  You're two minutes left in the fourth quarter.  That's who you are.  But I definitely want to do something a little different with him because it was really interesting  to listen to him.  I mean, he is dead serious about how he's been affected by this loss.  And then we'll beat him up for 20 minutes.  No problem.  Before we get into what they brought us.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  Come on.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it.  Come on.  Come on. 
[00:52:00]  New York.  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on.  I'm waiting on you.  I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  It's the Larry Tate Show.  You're hanging me out the drive.  I'm going to change the words.  I want to wake up.  It's all I look for every day.  Come on.  Come on.  Help me, you.  We did a lot of fine radio this week.  That's my highlight.  Oh, I love that one. 
[00:52:30]  The Larry King rap.  That's my highlight of the week.  Yes.  I don't do voices, but I will say, I want to wake up and not have a bowel movement in  my sleep.  That was Jim Norton doing very bad, Larry King.  Can we play Jim?  It works.  I know this is going to sound like it's out of left field, but it's okay.  Can we play Jimmy playing the drums?  Oh, my God.  The New York groove thing.  I love that one.  Where's the animal?  We're getting to it.  Oh, good.  We're stalling a little bit because we want to do like five minutes with this dumb thing 
[00:53:00]  and move on.  If we bring him in now, then we're committed to 720 with these guys.  Oh, sorry.  I thought we were still in commercial.  You got that, E-Rock?  Oh, finding it.  My God.  All right.  No, we should squeeze in, though, because people are enjoying this.  Black History Month.  Yes.  As E-Rock finds the New York groove thing with Jimmy.  We got today's honoree.  I don't think we have to explain it like we have been every day.  No.  Let's just do it.  We're honoring.  Black History Month.  Today's honoree.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, 
[00:53:30]  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the  melting pot.  It is today.  Today, we honor Norman Alexander Gibbs and Al White, best known as the Jive Dudes from  the hit film Airplane.  Mack a self-approach.  Slick.  A great amount of back.  Live performance down.  I'd take TC Ben, man.  Hey, you know what they say.  See a broad to get that booty yak-em.  Leg it down and smack them yak-em.  Coe got to be.  Yo. 
[00:54:00]  Our sentiments exactly.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow, that was...  Hey, I like today's...  Hold on.  I'm choking up a little bit there.  That was a nice little tribute.  I like today's honoree.  Hey, we got to get Travis's wife in here, by the way, before we bring in the pet people.  We like to call her the beard.  The beard, yes.  Yeah.  That's right.  But first, Jimmy.  Jimmy. 
[00:54:30]  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jimmy, are you turning red? 
[00:55:00]  I'm actually embarrassed.  I love that.  I actually see red in your face.  Why are you embarrassed?  The beauty of that clip is that's Jimmy playing the drums and the cymbals.  Oh, of course.  But the beauty is it's not my drums.  They were Carmine Appesee from Vanilla Fudge.  Yeah.  Who really is a legendary guy as a drummer.  You're there molesting his drums.  Very famous drum set.  Just brutalizing it.  All right.  We got Travis's wife in the studio. 
[00:55:30]  Young Lisa.  And we're hearing that you might cry.  Yeah.  Why?  A dog with two legs?  We got a dog with two legs.  Pretty much it.  Yeah.  A dog with two legs.  We go from tiger cubs.  Yeah.  To a dog with two back legs or front.  What are they?  Or maybe just two on the side.  That would be a little rough.  I heard the commercial while I was in the bathroom, actually.  It's a dog with two back legs that walks like a human.  Get me out of here.  There's no way I could see that.  I'm going to have goddamn nightmares. 
[00:56:00]  And we're going to get video.  Sam's got the camera.  And we'll throw the video up on onaradio.com.  But you'll see the reaction as Steve opens up the door.  Here is the dog with two legs as part of the Pet Expo.  Why are you hiding your jacket, Anthony?  What are you doing, Anthony?  It's not a thief.  I don't want him getting anything on my jacket.  I'm getting that missing leg juice.  And here we go.  Okay.  All right.  That's creepy.  Why is he dressed in like a Department of Public's works vest?  What's he going to be doing? 
[00:56:30]  Some road work?  We got a dog in studio, and it's walking around like a human being.  Just on its back two legs.  What?  This is Faith.  Hey, Faith.  What's up?  That looks like a big hassle for him.  The dog looks very tired.  And he walked 10 feet.  Faith was left to die by its mother.  It was deformed, and Laura Stringfellow over her and her family rehabilitated it, taught  it to walk like a human.  And the dog's appearing all weekend at the Super Pet Expo in Edison, New Jersey.  Wow.  And it's just a wonderful story, and Laura can tell you more about the dog. 
[00:57:00]  Does the dog get tired?  The dog looks like it gets exhausted walking like that.  Well, actually, she can walk pretty far, just depending on what she's walking on or what  the weather's like, but right now she's being kind of lazy.  Last night she had a big dinner, so.  Yeah.  Do you give it some wheels when it doesn't feel like walking like a human?  Like some kind of wheel apparatus for the front two legs?  No, we actually tried wheels, but she just stood upright, and she didn't like them.  That is weird. 
[00:57:30]  All right, how does the little guy eat?  She can either lay down and eat, or she can bend over and eat.  It just depends on what she's feeling like that day.  Yeah.  Wow, that is...  This dog is a YouTube sensation, been all over YouTube.  We've had a lot of fun with it, and we're bringing it to the Super Pet Expo this weekend  in Edison, and...  You can't just say we've had a lot of fun with it.  What kind of fun?  Oh, my gosh.  I could only imagine.  Yeah, that's right.  Have you ever seen a dog walk like a human before? 
[00:58:00]  No, this is the first for me.  You ever heard of Faith before?  No.  You don't need oven mitts.  Are we allowed to pet the dog, or is she...  Absolutely.  Dogs vary.  Go over and pet it.  Well, actually, she's a little nervous of men.  It's just...  Really?  She's really friendly, but she's just nervous, so she may not let you pet her.  All right.  How will she indicate that?  Will she just bite me?  No.  No, she'll either back away, or she'll just walk away.  She'll totally ignore you.  Oh, my goodness.  And here comes the dog walking around again like a human all over the studio.  Now, what happened to the legs? 
[00:58:30]  She was born this way.  Her mother was old and had an infection, so most of the puppies came out this way.  They didn't make it.  My brother had to save her.  I thought it was smoking or something.  Drinking.  Boo.  Boo.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Lisa, we got Lisa in the studio.  Lisa, what do you think there?  She's adorable, but it's really...  It's sad.  Like, I just want to hug her.  Why is it sad? 
[00:59:00]  I don't know.  Because I think about my own healthy puppy at home and how lucky he is, I guess.  Right.  I always take a meat cleaver to him and play him just like that.  Your puppy's not popular, though.  I mean, no disrespect, but this dog's got, like, everybody looking at it.  My puppy's a Cloverfield monster.  YouTube sensation.  Well, what we got to do with Lisa's dog, we got to remove two of the legs.  Oh, my God.  And then take it on tour.  You'll make a lot of money.  It'll be a nice retirement fund for you and Travis.  She's beautiful. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to attempt to pet her, but I have a feeling that she's going to be skittish.  Oh, my God.  She's not used to it.  All right.  Well, this is great.  Jimmy's over there.  Come here.  All right, she wants you to.  Letting the dog smell his hand.  Jimmy knows how to approach animals.  He usually does with a fistful of cash out of his car window.  Asking for favors.  She's indifferent to me. 
[01:00:00]  Really?  She's not being aggressive.  I'm petting her.  I could just as easily throw myself through the window for all she cares.  She has nothing to do with me.  Just ignoring me like most.  That whole walking thing is really odd.  I like how gravity affects dogs that are standing up.  Like, I see a lot of hanging flesh right by the tail.  And then the dog's got a little belly.  Have you guys seen other dogs walk like this, anybody?  No.  No?  No.  Any other dogs you have in the studio before? 
[01:00:30]  We usually don't have dogs.  I have a real funny joke, but not on the heels of what's happened.  So we have a funny story about Faith.  I bet you do.  Wait, wait, wait.  You got a funny story about Faith?  We got, when she was first on YouTube, we must have gotten over 100 emails in one day  and saying, hey, bring her to the show, bring her to the show.  So we finally tracked down Jude, Laura's mother, and we're grateful that they're coming and 
[01:01:00]  talking about their story, how they rehabbed this dog that was left to die.  It was born with deformities.  And they're going to tell the story tonight when they're appearing at Super Pet Expo.  And the beauty of what Laura's gone through is they took this dog from nothing and made  it into something.  And so it's kind of an inspirational dog.  That's funny.  There it is.  How great would it be if she just, because Steve is trying to pet her, how great would  it be if she just took two of his fingers off?  I would love that.  One act of viciousness. 
[01:01:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  I got to go back, though.  You said there was a funny story.  Well, she was rehabbed.  That's the funny part.  She was brought back to life.  She was left to die.  She was going to be gone.  And that's the funny story.  I don't know.  Well, I think figuratively speaking, not quite literally.  Thanks for covering for me.  I'm trying.  I know last year we were here, we brought you guys a baby tiger.  Yes, the baby tiger.  The baby tiger.  And it's on its way.  And it's about an hour behind us. 
[01:02:00]  And so we're going to try to get it to come by.  Oh, good.  All right.  We can tease that for the 8 o'clock hour.  A baby tiger.  Very cool.  Well, if we can get it back here in a little bit, we'll bring her right over.  I've actually seen this dog on YouTube.  And the dog walks.  It's really weird because you've never seen the dog walking this way.  It looks like the end of the Terminator, the way they animated the robot.  It's a very, very choppy movement.  But, I mean, it is kind of cool to see.  You know, I've never in 40 years seen it.  It's the Super Pet Expo. 
[01:02:30]  Where is this?  I'm sorry.  So people can come see the dog?  I'll plug the show.  Yep.  This weekend, Super Pet Expo, Edison, New Jersey.  SuperPetExpo.com.  We've got all types of animal entertainment.  Tons of shopping.  Cool pet products that you're not going to find at traditional pet stores.  Okay.  We brought a couple samples by from one of our sponsors, Poop Freeze.  Oh.  It works on dog poop, cat poop, human poop.  What is it?  Because I do the same thing, but I have a freezer.  I just pick it up and put it in there. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, for like, you know, when you have people over.  Yeah, I know.  What is this?  I do that with loose stool.  What do you do?  What is this?  It's just spray and pray.  You put a little frost on the poop.  It makes it easy to pick up.  Oh, it kind of freezes it a little bit.  Yep.  Puts a little frosting.  It's great for loose stool.  Nice to freeze.  Wow.  Nice.  We've got the ultimate air dogs this weekend performing.  We've got Elwood, the world's ugliest dog from New Jersey.  That's going to be at the show.  We've got a bird show.  We've got the chicken man. 
[01:03:30]  Not the chicken man.  The chicken man.  Maybe we'll bring him by next year.  The chicken man is making his annual appearance.  What's the chicken man?  He's got trained chickens.  He's got these silky, white silky bantam chickens.  They're trained.  He teaches them to do tricks.  It's a one of a kind.  And you can check out the chicken man with a link to his site at superpetexpo.com.  Let me ask you a question.  Are you guys all PETA members?  Oh, no.  Okay.  Negative.  Not that it's bad.  I'm going to say it's bad.  No.  No, I like to eat meat.  Oh, do you?  It's faiththedog.net as well, by the way. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  All right.  Very cute.  Ladies, gentlemen.  Thank you.  And Tiger later?  Absolutely.  We'll get him by as soon as we can.  Thanks for having us on.  All right, guys.  No problem.  And the Tigers are also appearing at the Pet Expo, right?  Absolutely.  Tigers are here all weekend.  Faith is just there tonight.  Okay.  All right.  Faith's just there tonight.  Previous engagements?  Yeah.  I understand.  You know the feeling.  Yeah.  All right.  Very busy schedule.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you guys very much.  Let's see the Terminator walk. 
[01:04:30]  Are you shocked?  Jimmy's hysterical, the Terminator walk.  But it's because it's...  Thank you.  It's actually a smooth walk.  It's doing it, but it's still odd to...  It's like a certain motion.  It's a little odd.  It looks really tiring.  I got to be honest with you.  Yeah.  But they're saying, yeah, the dog's very happy.  So, thank you.  Wow.  All right.  Bye.  See you later.  I'm such a sucker for animals.  Another thing freaked me out.  I'm sorry.  Did it?  Yeah.  I'm totally freaked me out.  What's wrong with two legs?  I don't...  The thing's not supposed to walk like that. 
[01:05:00]  You're right.  It would be...  It's like a horror movie.  It's like watching The Ring and having that thing come out of the TV.  It would be creepy if there were the two...  Like the left front and the left rear.  He was in the side.  Yeah.  How do you walk like that?  Ah!  Just kind of scrape yourself on...  What are you doing?  The poop freeze?  You're going to freeze your hand.  You're going to get frostbite or something.  Is that bad?  No.  It's probably not frostbite.  What are you talking about?  Frostbite is good.  Freeze your hand.  Do you feel this?  No.  I don't want to feel that open.  Give me your piece of paper.  Piece of paper?  Yeah.  This freezes poop.  Oh, Christ.  I didn't know it was going to come out like that. 
[01:05:30]  I just got Jimmy.  Jesus.  Was it cold?  I don't know.  I hit my shirt, but let's put it...  Give me it.  I'll spray it down here.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  You got my shirt.  Freeze something.  What would you do if you sprayed my hand?  Freeze Pat Duffy's beard and let's crack it off.  Yeah.  Pat Duffy, come here.  I want to freeze your beard.  Give me that straw...  The straw thing.  Yeah.  You need the straw.  I don't know where I'm flying.  So it doesn't go out in a big mist.  Anybody else have a straw?  I want to freeze your beard.  Is that cool?  Yeah.  Let's read the instructions first.  Why?  I don't know.  Because it might freeze his head like that stuff and then you crack it and it falls. 
[01:06:00]  Like the Super Bowl when you were a kid and the guy would come to school and shit.  Yeah.  Liquid nitrogen.  He'd put it in there and then bounce it and it would shatter.  No.  This is too much fun.  How do we do this?  Do it from the side.  Ow.  All right.  Just over here.  Freeze his beard.  I pull the beard because this thing's going to shoot.  You're going to pull the beard.  I don't want to...  Well, then it's going to get his hand.  Yeah.  Just let the beard hang.  Let the beard hang.  All right.  Watch out.  Let the beard hang.  I got good aim. 
[01:06:30]  It's frosting up on him.  Get a little more.  How does it feel?  He got his chin that time.  It's smoking.  He is.  It's smoking.  Maybe we should read the instructions.  Ah, screw it.  Warning.  This product is defined as not flammable.  So that's not a warning.  No.  However, this product can be ignited.  Oh, no.  If done by electronic equipment.  Like microphones.  All right.  Here we go.  The freezing of Pat Duppy's beard.  All right.  Freeze that beard. 
[01:07:00]  Go ahead.  Breathe.  I think we've killed him.  Let me touch it.  Oh.  It's all frozen.  I like the smoke coming off of it.  That's good.  Is that okay?  You don't know?  The lady that gave it to us has no clue.  It doesn't matter.  She's very sexy.  All right.  Who wants to...  What is your name?  Kelly.  Hi, Kelly.  Hi.  Is this stuff really bad for...  This is like the coolest thing we've ever gotten.  We could freeze stuff.  It's the coolest thing ever. 
[01:07:30]  I don't think it's bad.  Go for it.  Really?  How does it freeze the logs?  I mean, is it like...  Would it freeze your hand if you sprayed it or no?  I think you should try it.  All right.  Maybe someone should try freezing a log.  All right.  Oh!  Opie, first of all, he puts it in a bottle of water.  He puts the straw in there, pulls the trigger right over the mixing board.  Perhaps you should pull that away a little bit.  Considering that they fired all the engineers yesterday, maybe that wasn't...  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't screw around with the board at all.  Oh, man.  We're going to go off the air. 
[01:08:00]  There's water everywhere.  Oh, my God.  And there's no engineers.  No engineers.  What a great day to do that.  They've got to fly one in from, like, Washington.  He froze E-Rock's butt.  E-Rock had plumber cracks.  How does that feel?  That's cold.  All right.  Get in there and clean up the board.  Just clean the board.  We don't want to go off the air. 
[01:08:30]  Eric, stop worrying about yourself.  He's got the back of his neck.  It reminds me of when Steve McQueen froze the blob.  Are you all right, E-Rock?  Wow, that went from cold to hot really fast.  Yeah, it probably just burned.  Is that bad?  You can get the little freezer burn.  Let me see.  Oh, dude.  Is it red?  Your neck's effed up.  We probably shouldn't do that.  Steve McQueen froze the blob.  All right.  No one messing me, man. 
[01:09:00]  I got out in a bowling alley.  I got half a can still.  Cool.  Now that segment was worth it.  Oh.  Hi.  I didn't know you were still here.  They're looking in.  No, it was great.  The two-legged dog was terrific.  Like that.  Faiththedog.net.  See?  Get the plug in after I make fun of you.  All right.  Where else can we do this?  Oh, can we do the tongue?  No.  No.  Why?  That could be a problem.  Duffy, what can I freeze on you?  Belly?  Belly.  All right.  Let's go with the belly.  Well, you know, you should freeze on somebody. 
[01:09:30]  What?  Please.  What do you think?  What?  What do you think?  Of course.  Come on.  I don't want to see guys junk, though.  Why?  Who cares?  I must say you should cup it.  Oh, Sam's fro.  Can we do your fro?  Sam's fro.  Let's do Sam's fro.  Ow!  What happened?  He got shocked, standing up.  Good idea.  What the hell is that about?  Probably static charge.  God.  You probably built up a lot of static charge from firing that off. 
[01:10:00]  You think?  Yeah.  Holy shit, that.  I mean.  Hey, it's 7.30.  Ow!  I'm getting shocked, though.  Do you blame me?  What the hell was that?  I'm sure the water on the board didn't help.  Yeah, maybe that didn't help either.  That was the worst shock I've ever had.  Good one, huh?  Good one.  Nice.  Sam's here.  I'm getting off this thing.  No skin.  No skin.  What?  No skin?  We don't have a boss. 
[01:10:30]  We need to be the current boss.  We need to be the current boss.  Oh, we're going to freeze his afro?  All right.  Just get the top.  Oh, God.  Now he looks like he belongs on a plantation in the olden days.  Let me tell you something.  I know.  Oh, my God.  He has hair like Chicken George in the last episode.  Yeah.  That's it.  Is it cold on your fro?  Why would they give this to us? 
[01:11:00]  This is so good.  Yeah, that's very irresponsible.  Because they didn't expect you to spray people with us, I guess.  If I figured we'd spray like a sausage link and we'd all laugh.  All right.  I'm scared of touching anything, man.  We got to take a break and we'll continue.  Oh, wait.  Let's do a Grammy moment here.  Hold on a minute.  We got Kenny with a Grammy minute here.  Grammys are what? 
[01:11:30]  Sunday?  Yes.  Dude, that's shock.  Look, I'm shaking.  Yeah.  That wasn't fun.  I don't know.  Some doctors would probably prescribe that for you.  Little dab will do you.  Send Nurse Ratched a specimen.  We got Louis C.K. coming in, too.  Yes.  At, what, a half hour on Bobby Kelly?  Yes.  Good.  And some Tigers.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy minute.  Song of the year.  Before he cheats, Carrie Underwood. 
[01:12:00]  Glad I took my key into the side.  His pretty little souped up four-wheel drive.  Carved my name into his leather seats.  I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights.  Slashed a hole in all four tires.  Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:12:30]  All right, we're back to normal.  Opie and Anthony.  All hell is breaking loose around here the last couple of days.  We just learned that you're not supposed to shoot that stuff on skin.  Gets his wash immediately.  Oops.  You all right, E-Rock?  How's your butt crack in the back of your neck?  The butt's fine.  The neck's still a little burning, but it's all right.  Stinging a bit?  It would be funny if he sneezed and his head just snapped off. 
[01:13:00]  Hysterical.  All right.  What else?  Mitt Romney dropped out of the race.  No surprise there.  Whatever.  What are we going to do?  20 minutes on that?  He was done.  He was done.  McCain's your guy.  Not my guy.  Well, the guy for the Republicans.  And he's going to be the reason that we have the first black president in these United States of America.  You think so?  Yes, because there's a perfect storm developing, and John McCain is going to say or do something very stupid, 
[01:13:30]  and that's going to be the last thing needed to get Obama into the White House.  Mark my word.  What day is it?  February 2008, I said this.  I don't know.  I think that since he's guaranteed the nomination here, his handlers, his peeps,  are going to keep him from saying anything stupid.  Oh, yeah?  He doesn't have to do anything right now.  He's got to wait until the Democratic nomination's in, and then they start debating each other one-on-one. 
[01:14:00]  He's one of these guys.  Then he might trip up.  He's one of these guys.  I've heard about people like this.  It's called he can't help himself.  Yeah?  Yeah, he can't help himself.  I've heard about people like that.  And he's one of these type of guys.  Guy had a hard time in the nom.  Yeah, but his people could talk.  Like, behind the scenes, all they want.  But he's just one of these guys that can't help himself, and there's going to be a live  mic in front of him, and he's going to say something stupid, and that's going to be  it for your boy.  I kind of like that, though. 
[01:14:30]  What?  A loose cannon thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  It's going to scare some people, though.  I like a cranky person in there.  It's going to scare some people.  I'm telling you, man, it's a perfect storm.  It is developing, and the Obama train is going right to the White House.  You watch.  What is it?  You watch.  You watch, my friend.  Hey, you want to play your rant one last time?  We had a fine week of radio, looking back a little bit.  I finally did something I should have done a long time ago last night.  What was that?  I am a proud member of the National Rifle Association. 
[01:15:00]  From my cold dead hands!  Oh, good Lord.  I should have done it a long time ago.  Oh, great.  I, um...  You're in the NRA?  Yes.  I'm surprised I didn't say you're too radical.  We don't want you.  Psychopath.  It, uh...  Yeah, it was time.  I've, uh...  You know, I've had, uh...  Guns for a while, and, um...  They're the biggest gun lobby...  In the, uh... 
[01:15:30]  Country.  Yeah.  So, uh...  I give them my support.  Yeah.  Great.  I fully give them my support to the National Rifle Association.  And they're supporting Obama in the next election.  Shut up, Mick.  Oh, no.  What did I do?  No, how could...  I would be very surprised.  Obviously, they would go for McCain.  Well, yeah, they would go Republican.  Yes.  Before they ever go Democrat.  Yes, I understand that.  Yeah.  What do you get for joining the NRA? 
[01:16:00]  Um, well, you get a nifty patch.  And, uh...  You just, uh...  You get a voice.  Yeah.  What I like.  You get the, uh...  The voice of a very strong gun lobby.  And I'm now one of them.  I think they're very, uh...  A little too radical.  A little too radical?  Yeah, man.  Oh, you don't...  There's other groups I could have joined that...  You're funny, right?  Yeah, but this is the first step. 
[01:16:30]  You know, it all starts with the first drink.  I mean, it's the NRA and then...  NRA first and then other initials.  Oh, yeah.  You're two years away from a federal building.  Yeah.  And let's just say a U-Haul.  Yeah.  No, I'm not.  I love this grand country of ours.  And people think I'm insane.  Yeah, okay.  I love how we all try to prove that everyone else in this studio is insane.  Yeah, I know.  We really do.  I was just suggesting you need electroshock therapy.  Yeah.  And I'm a maniac. 
[01:17:00]  See, I understand I'm garbage.  You two actually think you have class.  That's the beauty.  It's like watching Oak go, you know, I look at Ant with the guns, and you're going, look  at him with the crazy beard.  You're both garbage.  That's what the problem is.  I've never thought I had class, sir.  Oh, and I know I do.  Hey, hold on, because we have no boss, and Derek ran in here with this because I think  they fired Tim.  I'm not really sure.  I haven't seen him yet today.  Has anyone seen Tim?  No.  Is he one of the firings today?  I hope not, because I like Tim.  This is Derek.  You know how we've been saying we have no boss? 
[01:17:30]  We truly, at this point, have no one to answer to.  No boss.  What's going to happen?  Like, who will come to the window and give us crap?  The biggest city, as far as radio goes, with no boss.  In our careers, we never really acknowledged PDs.  We kind of worked hand-in-hand with the general managers.  We don't have one of those.  No.  So, I don't know.  Do we go right to corporate?  What do they know?  No boss.  What? 
[01:18:00]  This is a fantastic station.  Is it?  With no boss.  No boss.  We've seen it all.  Oh, my God.  We've seen it all.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Nothing.  I thought that was just...  It was just talking with...  Music behind it?  Yeah.  A little odd.  You're going to get steam, man.  I don't care.  I think it's very important that if we play music behind talking, it becomes promotion. 
[01:18:30]  Just put music behind any talking.  It covers up everything.  And I love the production work that young Derek does.  Read the phone book and put a techno mix behind it.  So, yeah, my coffee is called...  What is that?  There was no theme to it.  It was just...  Everyone's talking about bosses.  Yeah, we don't have a boss.  There's firings.  Put a beat behind it. 
[01:19:00]  This is gold.  Steve.  Yeah.  You're getting a little abused.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  Oh, it's 845.  It's time for my daily thrashing.  Oh.  745.  745.  745, whatever.  I don't even know what time it is.  Sorry.  That's right.  You're an hour into the Atlantic Ocean, silly.  That's where I'd rather be at the moment.  How did you not get fired yesterday?  I don't...  You know what?  I was just asking myself.  Grossly incompetent, gay, and stupid.  I can't figure out how I still work here. 
[01:19:30]  I know how.  How?  Because you leave out a lot of adjectives.  Thank you.  They fired 400 people in this company yesterday.  Did they?  Not at all our guys skate.  That's just amazing.  Thanks.  Right now, bigwigs are listening going, oh, God, they thought they skated.  And that's how you executive produce.  Oh, yes.  And that's how you executive produce.  All right.  We got to take care of all the mommies out there.  There's some fear mongering going on.  Danny has brought it to our attention here.  They're at it again. 
[01:20:00]  Plastic baby.  Oh, they're always at it.  Oh, the news.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Plastic baby bottles.  Plastic baby bottles are dangerous now.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  There is troubling news tonight for millions of parents about the plastic bottles they use  to feed their babies.  Some of the country's leading environmental groups released a report today on a chemical  called BPA, which is in a vast majority of those bottles.  The groups say the chemical is released when bottles are heated, and that poses a health 
[01:20:30]  risk.  Over the summer, it was lead paint in toys, then the recall of one million cribs.  Today, it may be baby bottles.  It's just so heartbreaking to have to worry about these things and to feel that you might  be harming your child.  Oh, God.  Do you know how we were brought up?  Oh, please.  How are we going to raise super kids?  We can't raise super kids anymore.  We're trying to raise super kids.  We used to eat lead paint.  We're right off the windowsill.  A little paint chips. 
[01:21:00]  Because mommy was too busy drinking and smoking.  While she was pregnant.  While she was pregnant.  And so you went and got a few chips off the wall to hold you off between meals.  And shot up with some thalidomide.  Sure.  And our toys were ridiculous.  And look at us.  Yeah.  Or maybe not.  We're fine.  Right?  Maybe we shouldn't look it up.  Yeah.  We're some example.  Today's study found that when exposed to heat, baby bottles release the chemical bisphenol  A, or BPA, which researchers say has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and developmental 
[01:21:30]  problems in lab animals.  When bottles are used extensively over time, and when they're heated, higher levels of  this chemical leaches out, exposing young infants to elevated levels of this unnecessary  toxic chemical.  BPA is used to make plastic in 95% of baby bottles now on the market.  Uh-oh.  The association that represents the bottle manufacturers says the environmental groups  are just fear-mongering.  That the level of BPA released is too small to cause harm. 
[01:22:00]  And the FDA so far agrees.  BPA's adverse effects occur in animals only when they're exposed to far higher levels  of the chemical than possible from a baby bottle.  But it is reviewing BPA safety.  So at the end of the whole thing, they say that it's not that harmful, and that they're  just fear-mongering.  Yeah.  But the news itself just fear-mongered the entire broadcast there, the entire segment.  Yeah.  Before at the end, they said that even the FDA says it's okay. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  It was all about getting people to watch the news last night, because everyone has a little  effort.  I go to Liberty for my baby bottles.  That way they don't get the diabetes.  We don't have to play the last clip, do we?  No.  There's BPA-free bottles available.  It's not like the audio was that amazing.  It was just the fact that the news was reporting on it.  Yeah.  They were fear-mongering and saying how, you know...  You're saying that audio wasn't that amazing.  Watch what we do. 
[01:23:00]  Steve, put some techno behind it.  Oh, yeah.  Don't cut it up at all.  BPA.  Okay.  I wanted to replace some with a little techno to make a perfect example.  Well, E-Rock's a little frozen right now.  His brain froze.  You really got to give him a break today for once.  A little walnut.  I froze the back of his neck, and I think it's slowing him down a little bit.  And that brain is exactly what that product was designed to do. 
[01:23:30]  We were hoping to speed it up, but oh, well.  Take your time.  Go through an old playlist.  We'll just relax.  Yeah.  No pressure on us as everyone's just sitting in their cars waiting for something to happen here.  Exactly.  The hatchet is falling on everybody in this company, but we're comfortable.  Contract's expiring.  Take your time.  No reason to rush.  We'll just kind of sit here and, you know, kill time.  Yeah.  You know, somebody's certainly not willing to fire people.  Yeah.  I don't think they're paying close attention to us, you know. 
[01:24:00]  The day you want to have a show, like, really well put together is the day they're walking  through with a medieval mace swinging at sales heads.  Right.  Yeah.  Maybe today we should have maybe actually, like, produced the radio show.  Does that ask him for too much?  Produce one lousy radio show.  And then he found a techno beat.  We're over.  Oh, that's great.  It's done.  Oh, no.  Timing's everything.  Do we have that news clip?  Maybe we can play that with the techno beat and get a whole big bunch of laughs because  we built it up as big as we should have. 
[01:24:30]  Here it is, Jimmy.  All right.  Oh, well, there it goes.  It opened to put it in the thing, but it slipped out of his hand and hit the wall.  At Mach 3.  That thing bounced back nicely.  I want to hit the glass because that's always a nice noise for radio.  All right.  Yes, I do, Sharon.  But no one listens to me.  Sharon and Philly, go ahead.  Sharon.  Yellow.  Oh, Sharon.  Philly.  Sharon. 
[01:25:00]  No one brings up how crazy McCain is.  You?  On the phone?  Listening?  Hello?  What's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Philly.  What's going on?  Philly!  Wake up!  Are the phones working?  Did I freeze the board?  Order.  What is wrong now?  All right.  Well, yeah.  I bring it up all the time.  I think McCain is nuts.  Let's go to Mike in Fort Bragg.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Mike.  Anthony.  Anthony, by far, the best part of your NRA membership is the Armed Citizen article. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, I loved Armed Citizen.  You should do a daily reading every morning.  I really should.  You ever see Armed Citizen, Opie?  What they do is, in the magazine, they give you a little rundown of people.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Did Steve produce this segment?  Yeah, we're going to produce our own production at this point.  All right.  It's a little story.  Hold on there, Mike.  We're with you still.  Okay.  About Armed Citizens and how they fended off criminals.  A lot of times you'll hear a story about an intruder coming into a home and a young lad who picks up his .22 and blasts him full of holes. 
[01:26:00]  Nice.  Or maybe an elderly woman walking down the street and she gets mugged and pulls out her pistol and blows someone's head off.  It's wonderful.  They're great stories for when you're sitting on the bowl.  Do they profile the innocent ones that get shot in the head because they're coming over with some fresh-baked cookies?  How often does that happen?  Because they haven't heard from their son in months.  If you're a responsible gun owner, you don't, that doesn't happen. 
[01:26:30]  You just, I just heard on the news this morning, there's some cop and he, what he did was, he was cleaning his gun.  Really?  And it went off.  Give me a glow stick, will ya?  And it shot through the floor of his apartment and hit a baby in the arms.  What?  And all I can think is, how do you clean your gun while it's still loaded? 
[01:27:00]  I don't know!  It's insanity!  Yeah, you gotta make sure your gun is not loaded.  Especially when you're cleaning it, for God's sake.  Hey, why do you think it's supposed to be all opened up?  You're supposed to see that it's not loaded.  You want to take some E and rub ourselves up against teenage girls?  I need water.  What?  I'm sweating like crazy from all this E I'm taking.  Holy crap!  Or X.  Or whatever.  Oh, my glow sticks. 
[01:27:30]  Look how good I am at spinning them in front of my face.  I see that.  By the way, Jimmy doesn't want any E.  He's straight edge.  Yeah, Jimmy's straight edge.  Straight edge.  Ugh.  Die.  Dope.  Remember that dope that used to intern for us?  I want to huff some of that frozen stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Put it in a paper bag and start huffing.  I'm going to huff.  All right, let's say hi to Sharon in Philly.  Sharon, you there finally?  Yeah.  Sharon?  You dope.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island. 
[01:28:00]  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, ladies.  Hey, make it fast because we're heading toward a break.  We got Louis C.K. and Bob Kelly standing by.  All right, real quick.  Anthony, congratulations on joining the NRA.  Thank you, sir.  Problem being, do you think they're going to endorse McCain?  Well, they've got to endorse a Republican.  No, they don't.  John McCain wants to prohibit gun shows, my friend.  Really?  Yeah, there's your guy.  There's your guy.  Well, what do you think?  They're going to go for Obama or Hillary? 
[01:28:30]  Well, probably not, but you have a third choice that really isn't viable for an NRA member.  He wants to stay in Iraq another hundred years.  I'm not saying that the other two are much better, but McCain is not your Republican.  I don't think McCain said he wants to stay in Iraq for another hundred years.  He said we'll stay as long as it takes to get the mission done, even if that's a hundred years.  Look, man, Rush Limbaugh hates McCain.  We need another hundred years war, don't we?  That should say it all right there.  Yeah, he's not conservative enough.  Yeah, he's not conservative enough for Limbaugh. 
[01:29:00]  But that's Rush Limbaugh.  I like that.  That might be nice that he's a little bit of a moderate and a little nutty.  Actually, if you vote with McCain, you can't have your guns, but you'll have a lot of taxes.  No, believe me.  I don't think he's taking anyone's guns away.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  We've got to take a break, but Pat and Belmore.  What's up, Pat?  Yeah, guys, it sounded like you were shopping for underwear at Abercrombie & Fitch.  All right.  Where's the underwear section over there? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Can I just get some Fruit of the Looms in that plastic bag with the cute little fruit on the front  instead of the other underwear with the real fruit on the front?  I don't want to carry around this bag with a naked man's abs on it.  Do you have a bag that I can take out of here so I don't look like I'm heading down to the mine shaft for a drink?  Do any of these supermodels actually work in this store? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, my God.  Where's the fitting room?  Oh.  Why are there glory holes in the fitting room?  I hate going into stores.  Oh, my God.  You get a headache.  Ready, steady, go.  Oh, yeah.  Ready, steady, go, though.  All right.  Good choice, Y-Rock.  Let's get to a break here.  This is wonderful.  I'll put this over everything. 
[01:30:30]  Not under like music's supposed to be over.  Steve enjoys this music when he's, like, kneeling down in an adult bookshop doing poppers.  What the hell, Jimmy?  In the section men shouldn't be seen in.  I just got lost.  I walk through those, that beaded curtain thing that hangs in the adult bookshop into the other section where all the gentlemen hang outside the booths waiting to greet you.  All right, turn down the music. 
[01:31:00]  I'm getting a headache.  We're going to break with something called Rap Wars.  We had Kenny and Roland.  They kind of went at it, these two.  They kind of did a little rap thing back and forth with each other.  Yeah.  And they did fun of each other.  And when Butch is featured in this prominently, it's a fine little piece of production.  Kenny versus Roland.  Rap Wars.  Up next, Louis C.K. and Bob Kelly.  And now, ladies and gentlemen.  Yo, yo, it's really good. 
[01:31:30]  I got the two baddest shot callers in the hood.  Club soda Kenny on my left.  Rolling on my right.  We're here to find out who got the illest disses in the house.  Come on, we got to get this done so I can drink a 40.  Got my man on the ones and twos.  DJ, fire it off when you're ready.  See what's popping in here, kid.  My style is the best, and so I challenge you.  Kenny, bust some shots.  This is the showdown.  Here we go.  Your s*** sounds like a Kia. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, s***.  You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.  Your mama.  That's a rookie move.  The difference between you and a pizza, a pizza can feed a family of four.  Ken, are you going to let him get at you like that?  Roland, you're just mad because I'm styling on you.  At least I know who my daddy is.  He's a baby daddy.  He throws man s*** around.  Roland, what you got to say about that, Holmes? 
[01:32:30]  At least we don't have to pour a Happy Meals on Layaway.  Oh, yeah.  Your flow's so weak, you can't wipe the sweat off my s***.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everybody put it together for Roland.  Taking home the win, baby.  Rolling out.  Make money, money, make money, money, money.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:33:00]  We're pretty much running the place at this point.  And it feels good.  It's a weird day yesterday, Louie.  Louie C.K. in studio.  They fired pretty much everybody.  There's no one left here.  Jesus, really?  No joke.  Wow.  The company did some cutbacks.  Wow.  A lot of people were affected.  Yeah, over the past couple of weeks, we really have no boss left.  Nobody.  Radio is brutal.  It's really like a two-minute, one-man-leave thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Under dome.  And a lot of fine people got fired, by the way.  A lot of people I've worked with over the years, so I'm not trying to make light of it.  But the fact is, at this point, we're running the place.  Right.  We don't have a program director.  We don't have a general manager.  Oh, my God.  We don't have most of the sales staff.  Their heads were chopped off.  We don't even have a...  What about the woman with the things?  The body?  Yes.  Tracy, she's gone.  Gone.  She's gone?  Yeah.  So I have a shot with her now.  She has knees.  No.  She's probably too depressed.  I mean, I was very attracted to her, too. 
[01:34:00]  No, she was nice.  If a computer goes down, there's no one here to fix it anymore.  I'm spraying water all over the board because I did something stupid.  We don't have an engineer to fix the board if it goes out.  I mean, this place is like...  It's...  I don't know.  Wow.  It's just rudderless now.  Yeah, it's like a ghost town.  But this is like CBS radio, isn't it?  Here?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You would think this is like a college radio station where you have some...  It's the Tiffany Network.  Yeah.  Columbia, whatever that means. 
[01:34:30]  Broadcasting.  Columbia Broadcasting.  Yeah.  College radio is better staffed at this point.  Wow.  You know, you've got the sophomore that's just learning about electronics.  So you're like, all right, yeah, fix the board.  Good luck to you.  Soldering iron.  Really long pause between the introduction of the song.  There's this flaming lips, and then you hear...  Hey, we want to get...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Like, after...  Yeah.  We want to get right into this.  Louis C.K. did some radio up there in Cleveland.  What, you called into a radio show?  I called into Cleveland.  I was doing, like, a few in a row. 
[01:35:00]  Buffalo, and then this one was...  I actually thought it was Buffalo, and I say Buffalo a couple of times.  Oh, good.  Because to you, you don't know, and you don't care.  No, I have no idea.  And the thing is, they didn't even call me on it.  They said nothing about me saying Buffalo.  I realized.  Really?  At the end, they said, anyway, we'll be glad to see you in Cleveland.  I was like, oh, this is Cleveland?  Oh, Cleveland?  Yeah.  I thought this was...  Oops.  Well, you called the Maxwell show.  We've had problems with this show in the past.  Not real problems, because we slap them around, and then we throw them back into obscurity.  Right.  So they kind of get excited every once in a while when we bring up their names, but relax. 
[01:35:30]  You're back to obscurity by Monday.  Yeah.  The show, the last time we talked about them, they claimed that this pothead that's on the  show is funnier than Jim Norton.  So I'm like, all right, this is what we're going to do.  We're talking to a hell of a lot more people than this dumb radio show, right?  Mm-hmm.  We put out the challenge.  We're like, look, send us five minutes of you being funny.  Yeah.  And then we'll let our listeners decide how funny you really are.  And then, of course, he had some weird reason why he couldn't do it and stuff. 
[01:36:00]  You know, I guess he didn't want his great talent to be exposed to, like, a giant audience.  No, no.  Basically, we called him out for the phonies they are, is what it comes down to.  And then he has problems with Louie, who's a great comic.  It's amazing to me.  It's almost like the greatest crime this guy commits is that he's not a funny guy.  Like, I don't care if you want to crap talk us or we'll crap talk you, but the curse of  him is that he's just not a funny dude.  And he tries to be a moralistic guy about what humor is appropriate. 
[01:36:30]  He's just, what he is, he's a big fat slob who has, like, a one place that he feels comfortable  and in charge.  And you, a brilliantly funny dude, calls up.  You have no idea who he is.  You don't even know what city he's in.  Yeah.  Do you understand?  You don't know the city he was in.  Right.  And that showed him, this is who I am.  Yeah.  This is a guy who's at his own show, HBO specials.  He has no idea who I am or where I am.  Yeah.  And besides not being funny, you know, they try to make believe there's some kind of  edgy show, but they're using fake radio voices. 
[01:37:00]  They're like, ha, ha, ha, ha, a lot because they're uncomfortable to be in front of a live  microphone.  He's the fake name, Maxwell.  That's a cool guy, like, hardcore.  Hey, I'm Maxwell.  Are you?  Maxwell what?  Stop.  Yeah, what's your last name?  Can I call you Max?  I use a fake name.  No, you don't.  But yours is not a radio name.  Yours is a name from childhood.  Yours is a nickname.  But that's different, though.  I hate this name.  Nah, you know.  I hate it, I do.  Everyone knows your name.  I got it when I was 12.  Oh, sweetie, don't be honest.  I'm now pushing 30.  I hate this.  Pushing 30.  That's right.  Pushing 12. 
[01:37:30]  80-year-old OB.  That's going to be something.  That's what I'm saying, Lou.  Yeah, that's where you're headed.  It's okay.  So, let's get right to the audio.  Louie couldn't wait to, you know, send this in to us.  And Maxwell looks like a complete dope.  And he's, of course, the guy that invented this brilliant thing.  And punt.  See, he'll make fun of you.  And then he'll.  And punt.  Because he's done.  Punt.  Because he's done, you know.  Because the defense did their job, and now you got to punt.  Oh.  That's his, like, hardcore way of going, end of story.  Almost like the eviscerating is done. 
[01:38:00]  And punt.  Well, when I went on, as soon as they came on, like, I'm just waiting.  You know, somebody comes on.  You're going to be on the air in a minute.  And I'm like, okay.  And then there's, I hear them come back from the air, and he's like, yeah, we got to.  Like one of those guys who just, there's a lot of silence.  And then he's like, all right, we're back here.  When I was talking like that, and I was like, this is odd.  The first thing I say to the guy is, you guys are weird.  Just because he's such a strange.  He's trying to be too cool for the room.  Yeah.  And he doesn't talk in his natural voice.  No.  He talks in a radio guy voice.  We don't respect any radio show that has to, like, do the fake radio voice. 
[01:38:30]  No.  Bob Kelly here, too.  I'm sure you have some experience talking to radio shows across America.  So pipe in when you can, all right?  Yeah.  Here's Louie C.K.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm just trying to move it along, because we're running out of show here.  Yeah.  Louie C.K. on the phone with this Maxwell show up there in Cleveland.  It's kind of frustrating.  Or else you would close the door, get privacy, and meanwhile they go jump out the window like  Eric Clapton's stupid baby.  Oh, now see that right there. 
[01:39:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Now see, Stan's where he thinks that.  I think that's a terrible joke.  Yeah, it happened forever in a day ago.  I don't care.  I really don't care.  You know what I mean?  God gave that guy one really good talent.  He could play the guitar.  He wrote a great song about it.  Made him a million dollars.  I don't care.  A million dollars.  I don't care about any of it.  I don't care about any of it.  He's trying to say how it's a terrible joke as he's laughing the entire time.  He's laughing at the joke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And also to keep in mind is that the setup to this, this is not, I don't do a joke about Eric Clapton.  This guy said that I shouldn't make fun of my kids on stage. 
[01:39:30]  And I said, why?  And he said, well, I have a baby.  So, and I just went after him and I said, oh, that's really sweet.  You got a little baby.  Do you have any idea what you're headed for?  And I just started talking about being a parent.  And this bit is about how you can't crap in private when you have kids.  If you're watching your kids by yourself and it's time to crap, you have to gather them in the bathroom to watch you.  Because otherwise, if you do it with your doors, you're in the bathroom with the door closed.  Meanwhile, they're walking off out the window like Eric Clapton's stupid baby. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I call him stupid.  I don't care.  He's dead.  But that's the point of the bit.  So that's the point of the bit is how much pressure you live with as a father.  He laughed at it.  Of course he laughed at it.  He's only on the air for another five to ten minutes, by the way.  But the bottom line is just the fact that he has a baby he thinks makes him sick.  That makes it important to him to be offended.  An important issue.  Yeah.  And he's just a phony, local jerk.  But he takes part in the joke.  He actually makes a joke about how Eric Clapton made money. 
[01:40:30]  He thinks he made one million dollars.  I think he made a little more than that.  A million dollars.  He's like Dr. Evil.  One million dollars.  It's a lot of money to him.  And then he asked me for marital advice, and I gave it to him, and everyone laughed for  another five to ten minutes after I said that.  And then they hung up, and the instant he hung up, he turned on me.  Yeah.  Well, that's what most of these radio guys do.  Just weirdly phony.  We've had horrific comments.  I would have been happy to feel the comments on there.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  And actually, he says to me there, you shouldn't have made that joke.  What if you're, I don't know if you were going to play that, but he said, the next 
[01:41:00]  thing he said, I said, he said, what if your baby fell out of a window?  Would you laugh at it?  I'm like, no, but I assume other people would.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Louie makes complete sense in this situation.  I mean, I wouldn't laugh at my own baby dying, but.  But others would.  Folks have at it.  And you understand that.  You would.  Enjoy the show.  Nothing worse than chuckle in.  Yeah, Bob, my friend Bob will make fun of my dead baby.  I would be laughing.  But whatever.  Exactly. 
[01:41:30]  Here's another telltale sign of an unfunny guy, is to start dictating what subjects are  appropriate.  Right.  It's like that.  He's got his list.  Yeah.  You know how gamblers have a tell?  Yeah.  The tell of an unfunny person, besides the silence after jokes, is when they try to dictate  morally what's appropriate.  Based on their morality or what they find important, that 10 minute segment.  There are some guys that you go in, you know, they tell you this guy isn't like this.  He's very.  And you're like, OK, I get it.  You know, I'll do my stuff, but I get how he is. 
[01:42:00]  But when you go into these places where they're supposed to be edgy, they're supposed to be  hip and cool, and they kind of suck you in, and then you're kind of doing your thing,  and they're with you.  And then to trash you after is like, it's just ridiculous.  That's a wuss move.  We've had horrific confrontations with people that it's uncomfortable for everyone, but  at least it's a real moment.  It's real.  For the most part, we don't talk bad about you after you leave the studio.  I'm sure somebody will come up with a time maybe we did that. 
[01:42:30]  But in general, man, our track record is pretty damn good.  We've had fistfights on the air.  We've had all sorts of horrific things happen.  I hate this guy.  Someone should hike his baby and then punch.  And as soon as you start deciding what's funny, like because you have a kid, you're  finished as an edgy jock, which you're not.  No.  You're just faking it.  What is the next clip?  Let's go right into it here.  I don't know.  I think it continues.  Now, OK, let me ask you this.  What if your kid jumps out the window?  Are you going to laugh when a comedian makes a joke about your kid jumping out the window? 
[01:43:00]  No, of course not.  But I assume other people will, because what do they care about my stupid kid?  There you go.  Great laugh.  I don't want to laugh about my own kid jumping out a window, but that's my kid.  Not your kid.  I hope you do laugh.  Oh, OK.  Right.  Right.  Right.  I like his approach.  I like it.  All right.  Well, I feel like there's healing happening here.  Now, what a phony voice.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He actually, like, I like his approach.  No, he's totally on my side. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, but that was, that's shmarmy, too, what he's saying.  It's like, I like his approach.  Right.  Like, if it was any, I like the angle he's taking.  It's not the typical angle.  He's not just being a, OK, you're being a little smart.  I approve.  Here's what I like his approach is about.  He tried to call you on something, but not harshly.  Right.  Because basically, he's one of those guys.  He's still being friendly.  Of course he is.  It actually felt to me like he's setting me up.  Like, he's enjoying this.  Yeah.  And he's playing the other guy.  Right, right.  Hey, should you have said that?  And I go, OK, here, I'll knock that out of the park. 
[01:44:00]  Uh-huh.  Let's enjoy that.  But he really was being a douche.  And he's not funny.  He's not a funny dude.  So what happens was, he said something, and you had a very funny, honest answer.  And then being an unfunny radio hack, he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, because he couldn't combat it.  Because he didn't, yeah, exactly.  He couldn't combat it.  Exactly.  That's what you are.  So wait a minute.  Play what happens next.  I don't know how you got these lined up.  No, I think we got it pretty organized, because it gets better and better.  Because as soon as Louie hangs up, then you get this quote, real Maxwell. 
[01:44:30]  Watch out.  Uh-oh.  Had the chance to really go at it with you while you were still on the phone.  Would have been happy.  Yep.  Well, hey, Louie, thank you so much, man.  We appreciate it.  Thank you so much.  You're going to be here in Cleveland February 15th.  And then he plugs you.  Yeah, yeah, well.  And then he plugs you.  You know how many times we've said, you know what, go F yourself, F your show, you know,  and just keep kicking you as you're trying to leave the studio.  Yes.  This guy turns around and gives the plug.  Gave me an infomercial.  Like a good little radio boy.  Yep. 
[01:45:00]  You're a little radio boy.  Good boy, Maxwell.  Good boy.  Good boy.  Good boy.  Just don't want to get in trouble with the local comedy club that's sponsoring it, right?  Good little boy.  Good little boy.  Fat shill.  Well, hey, Louie, thank you so much, man.  We appreciate it.  You're going to be here in Cleveland February 15th.  You can still buy a ticket.  Somebody told me this was Buffalo.  This is Orange.  This is Cleveland?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cleveland.  Good.  I'm actually looking forward to that.  And they laugh. 
[01:45:30]  They laugh.  Hey, thank you.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  But Cleveland is awesome.  I can't wait for that show.  That's going to be awesome.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Now, remember, I appreciate a lot of life.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Great.  Not, hey, Louie, you're not funny.  Yeah.  Not, we're not plugging your gig because you suck like an honest guy would have said.  Plug it.  Give me money in my pocket with your listeners going to my show.  Yeah.  Thank me.  Tell me how much you appreciate it.  And then this.  All right.  Get ready.  Here it comes.  And this is where we expose the little radio boy. 
[01:46:00]  Now, Louie has hung up the phone.  Coward.  Had the chance to really go at it with Louie, which, by the way, would be great radio.  Would have been awesome for his show.  People aren't turning it off.  No, of course not.  They're going to listen to every single word.  By the way, no one brought this to our attention.  You had to tell Sam, which means no one out there that listens.  Nobody's listening.  Nobody even heard it.  Nobody even heard it.  Yeah.  Usually when one of you guys.  No one's listening.  Usually when one of you guys gets in a situation.  Somebody in your world.  Immediately. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  So you hung up and this is what happened.  And this is where I pretty much hate every radio guy.  They had a nice little save there at the end.  Oh, I'm looking forward to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to tell you, man.  Still.  The voice changes.  Right?  I got to tell you.  I got to tell you.  Now it's time for my man cow impression.  Yeah.  I got to tell you.  Let me tell you something.  You know what it is, too?  Because he knows he has to go home and look at his stupid wife and she'll probably go,  why didn't you call him on the baby's show? 
[01:47:00]  I was looking in our baby's eyes when he was saying that awful stuff and it's your show  and you let him.  I was so startled that I threw it out the window.  I got to tell you.  The voice changes no more.  Thank you.  Louis Asia.  I was here.  They have a black guy on the show called Cracker Man.  You know, because white people are crackers.  That's funny.  That's the switcheroo.  That's the old switcheroo.  If you look left, they go right.  These guys are unpredictable.  That's great.  That Maxwell's a funny guy.  In charge.  That's good. 
[01:47:30]  What's the white chick's name?  And punts.  And punts.  And punts.  So listen how the voice changes from, you know, to his man cow impression.  They had a nice little save there at the end.  Oh, I'm looking forward to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meh.  I got to tell you, man.  Still, though, at the end of the day, making fun of Eric Clapton's kid falling to his death  is not funny.  You laughed at it, ass.  Yeah.  I agree.  I agree.  I agree.  Who's the broad? 
[01:48:00]  The hole.  Wait, Dan?  It's just called the hole.  It's just called the hole.  The showstopper.  I agree.  Who's the brakes?  Who's the broad?  Ha ha.  You listen to your stupid PD.  They said, you need a woman to bounce everything out, you dope.  Ew.  The big, the woman on a radio show, which amounts to that big, greasy, sweaty hand on the locomotive  brake handle.  And sparks just fly out of the wheels.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The luggage vaulted towards the front of the car. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's what she is.  Ladies with nice hats go screaming.  Oh.  Ah.  So she added to this by saying, I agree.  Of course she did.  That's terrific.  You're getting paid way too much.  Cha-ching.  Honey.  You skirt.  Yeah.  Of course you agree, you silly, typical broad.  Of course you do.  Make some cookies and serve them to fatso with apnea.  I have a baby.  Do you?  I gotta.  No, I gotta. 
[01:49:00]  I gotta tell you.  I gotta say.  Now that it's safe in here, I gotta really tell you what's going on.  And who is Eric Clapton?  It was just a boy.  Who's Eric Clapton anyways?  Well, here's the thing.  He gets, he gets what's weird.  I don't know if you have the turn on here where he, he says that, because he's kind  of taking it from his own guy, starts saying it wasn't that, uh, wasn't that big a deal.  Oh, good.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  I think it's right here.  I agree.  I mean, come on, Stansberry.  At least give me that.  That's not funny.  Kids falling out of open windows and, and, and, and splattering on the ground is like, 
[01:49:30]  well, I mean, he didn't paint that whole picture for you.  But it's just what Eric fell out of a skyscraper, right?  In New York City, right?  Yeah.  He walked out of the window.  Yeah.  I mean, dude, that's not funny, regardless of whose kid it is.  Well, why did you laugh at him?  Why'd you laugh?  Well, he did it on your show.  The guy with him on the show, actually, I really liked this guy from listening to this  stuff, because the other guy actually totally puts up a fight and says, hey, I, I, maybe  I wouldn't laugh at it, but I don't begrudge somebody else laughing at it. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  And you're making way too big a deal out of it.  Stansfield, the guy he works with, uh, is not as bad.  Like, he's a guy, the first time we went to a fight with this guy, he's like, eh, he's  just kind of siding with, he knows that the Maxwell he's working with is  just his, his, his guy.  He has to side with him.  Right.  So he's not as bad.  Like, he, I don't think.  Well, by the end of this craziness, and you'll see how bad it gets, he actually says he doesn't  think he should be working.  They, like, he almost, they almost, he almost fires him on the air.  He says, the fact that you find this funny means that you're a turd and I'm actually 
[01:50:30]  questioning working with you.  Like, he says that seriously.  He's good.  Well, here we go.  I don't necessarily think he would have to be in this situation.  I think a kid falling to his death is not funny out of a window.  Just like Puddle of AIDS jokes aren't funny.  I don't think, I, listen to me.  Oh, that's Jimmy.  What is that about?  But listen to the rest of that, because there's something really absurd about it.  Listen right for a second.  Puddle of AIDS jokes aren't funny.  I don't think, I, listen to me.  Do you have to have AIDS to know that AIDS jokes aren't funny?  No.  Wait, keep watching.  So what's the difference?  Oh, you know. 
[01:51:00]  Puddle of AIDS, funny.  No, no.  Puddles of AIDS are not funny.  All right, stop there.  Puddles of AIDS don't exist.  They don't exist.  Puddles of AIDS are not funny.  When I'm walking to work and I see Puddles of AIDS, that's not funny to me.  They don't exist, you silly, you silly radio boy.  What an ass.  You silly local car salesman.  They don't exist.  If you understood humor, that's what is funny, where you invented a Puddle of AIDS.  You dope.  Puddle of AIDS does exist if a, you know, a gay couple's baby falls out a window. 
[01:51:30]  See, now I just got to put them both together like that.  Baby falling in Puddles of AIDS.  I love the way.  No, it's too far.  I love the way Puddles of AIDS is immediately associated with everybody.  Everybody knew Jim Norton.  Yes, exactly.  I know.  My line, you're associated with Puddle of AIDS.  He doesn't like me.  The problem is, not only do I not like him, but I don't respect him in a comedic sense at all.  No, of course not.  I, that, the worst, is I don't respect him comedically.  A Puddle of AIDS is a non-existent thing. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Silly boy.  Yeah.  Silly radio boy who doesn't have the courage.  You're taking the, like, the darkest, worst, most sort of vilified disease of our time and  making a Puddle of it.  Yes.  There's nothing funnier than that in the world.  You're taking someone to slip in it.  In the world.  Yes.  Not only say, like, there's a Puddle of AIDS, put a rope around it.  But I hope you have a wacky, a wacky slip of the foot in it.  Yes.  And fall in it.  Yeah.  And go, oh my God, I'm in a Puddle of AIDS.  Yes.  It's a banana peel joke.  And wipe it out of your eyes like a Three Stooges person.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  But you know what, though?  It's almost like if you want, this is why I don't put content restrictions, because the  Three Stooges, who are some of the funniest things ever, when you break it down, I mean,  it's not funny to cave somebody's head in with a brick or to jab somebody.  Is it funny to blind somebody with your fingers?  No.  See, that's what happens.  I'm just explaining to Fat Local Pig in Cleveland.  Yeah.  When you break down humor like that, that's what happens.  Nothing is technically that funny when you break it down like that.  No, it's not.  That's why you're not a funny guy, because you don't understand that.  All right, with that, we got one more clip here. 
[01:53:00]  It's really not the end of the world, man.  But when I asked him about it, his claim was, I would expect other people to make fun of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If it was my kid, it wouldn't be funny.  Well, guess what?  That's not my kid, and I don't think it's funny, because I have a heart.  And maybe there's just some things you don't do for a laugh, dude.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe you just go, you know what?  Which is everything in his book.  Guys, the thing that's really important here, though, I wish you had this clip, but I don't  know where the hell it is.  But he says in one of these segments, because he went on for two hours, this went on for 
[01:53:30]  two hours, that he only talked about how angry this made him, to the point that he's actually  talking about firing the people around him because they're not agreeing.  But he says at one point, he goes, don't get me wrong, the thing he did on the air was  funny.  The thing, the way he used the reference here, I laughed at that.  He says that twice, he says, it's the part, he says on his HBO special, this dude does  a whole bit about Eric Clapton, and I've seen it, and that's what I was offended by.  He made it up.  I've never, the one time in my life I've mentioned Eric Clapton with my face and mouth ever was 
[01:54:00]  on his show.  So he made up that I do a bit about it and said, that's what's offensive.  And he says it like three times, he keeps backing up, he goes, no, no, no, here it was funny.  Yeah, because he laughed.  Yeah, because he laughed.  But in the bit he does on his special, and somebody needs to dig it up, because I'm not  sure which special, that's what he keeps saying, find it on his special.  It doesn't exist.  And then later he says, I think he makes jokes about having sex with his kids, too, and  I don't find that funny either.  Which I don't!  No.  He just made up bits. 
[01:54:30]  Well, that's kind of funny, though.  If you have a radio show, that's what you do.  You just make up stuff, and it's fine, because you can't be proven wrong.  Can we sum this up, too?  Not to finish it, but just to sum it where we are right now.  He has a fake radio voice.  Yes.  He has a fake name, and he has fake indignation.  He fake laughs at your joke, and then he fake spits that you never did.  He makes bits that...  By the end of the...  He's a fake.  Everything about this guy is fraudulent.  By the end of his show, he said, I hope Louie's baby falls out of a window. 
[01:55:00]  He says it seriously with no jokes.  Oh, there you go.  That's nice.  That he hopes...  Well, good.  One of those type of people.  I love those types of people that will say the worst, most horrible things, as they've  just spent a bunch of time trying to say how horrible something you said was.  Which, you know, I'm sure I should be offended, but I don't think God will throw my baby out  a window at the behest of Maxwell.  Some Maxwell.  Some hack in Cleveland doing the radio.  He is a hack.  Let's finish this clip.  Some things you don't do for a laugh, dude. 
[01:55:30]  Maybe that's it.  Maybe you just go, you know what?  I have ethics and morals, and I'm not going to do that for a laugh.  Ew.  Because that ain't cool.  Because two parents had to deal with their kids splattered all over the street.  No.  It doesn't matter whose kid.  Actually, he fell onto a part of a roof.  That's what I would do.  Not to mention a building guy with a mop.  He believes in it.  Well, I hope one of his kids falls out of a window and dies.  Not so funny, then, is it?  What?  No, it wasn't, because you seriously, like, meant it. 
[01:56:00]  And you have no comic.  There was no comic.  There was no comedic angle to what you just said, you jackass.  And just so we, I went right back to the first clip, because that's angry Maxwell.  But when he had the chance to really go at it with you, you got this.  It's kind of frustrating, yeah.  Or else you would close the door, get privacy, and meanwhile they go jump out the window like  Eric Clapton's stupid baby.  Oh, now see that right there.  That's what I'm saying.  Now, see, Stansbury thinks that.  I think that's a terrible joke.  Yeah, it happened forever and a day ago. 
[01:56:30]  I don't care.  I really don't care.  You know what I mean?  God gave that guy one really good talent.  He complained to the guitar.  He wrote a great song about it.  Made him make it out.  I don't care.  I don't care about any of it.  He's laughing.  Higgling.  And he makes a joke about it.  Right, and participating.  You're a phony, man.  And actually, I'm making a joke about being a dad, using the stakes of a famously dead  baby to explain it.  He's actually making fun of the dead baby by saying, he made a million dollars!  Yeah.  A million dollars. 
[01:57:00]  I'll say this, man.  Good for Stansbury.  You know what?  For at least going to bathroom in some way.  I respected him because for the whole hour and a half, he doesn't stop.  He says he refuses to let Maxwell have all the ground.  Maybe he has a real chance in radio.  I think if they got rid of Maxwell, which they should, and gave that guy the show, they'd  have something going on.  It would be all right.  He's in a position where he can't go crazy.  And here's the thing.  When I go on radio all over the country and guys are like, hey, so what do you think about  Britney Spears?  I'm like, I don't have anything about that. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, well, all right, we're out of time.  Those guys, those guys I'm fine with because they're that.  Yeah.  But this guy is a phony, disgusting coward.  Yes.  He's just a, I mean, I've never, there's nothing that grosses me out more than taking part in  a joke, cheering it on, and then when the person's gone, claiming to be better than  that joke that you laughed at.  And then, and also isolating the thing and the joke and just, he says it over and over  again.  And what a sanctimonious, like, like he's going to get the Nobel prize for pointing out that 
[01:58:00]  it's a shame that a baby fell out of a window once.  And you have no morals or scruples or whatever the hell he said because you're in the radio  business.  Yeah, exactly.  You sat there and taken it.  And right now we're on in Cleveland.  So here's the number if you want to call his show.  Oh, that's nice, Jimmy.  1-800-348-1007.  It's 1-800-348-1007.  Now, if you're hearing this anywhere else in the country, we're on in delay in afternoons  in Cleveland.  So if you're in Cleveland, we're on now.  If you're anywhere else in the country, we're not on until 3 to 7 in Cleveland time. 
[01:58:30]  No, we're live right now in Cleveland.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  No, no, no, but I'm saying we're on delay by two minutes.  No, right now we're live.  Yeah, this is afternoon.  Oh, hold on.  And punt.  And punt.  You know, it's just not funny.  And punt.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Not kid fall over the window.  No, it's not funny.  It's not funny.  Look for Stansberry.  Stansberry, good for you, man.  You know what?  Good for you.  At least you knew that it was a funny joke and you're working with a sanctimonious fat 
[01:59:00]  man.  There's nothing worse.  You know what happens later?  Also, they had mentioned that his boss came in the studio in a break and said, you're being  kind of a wimp about this.  Like, what's your problem?  Like, the boss took weirdly, the company guy, took the side that, because the boss sees  the ratings.  The boss said you and Anthony are kicking your ass.  It is the wife.  So he says on the air that the boss said, you're worrying me a little because you're coming  across like a wuss.  You're coming across like a guy who can't take a joke.  It's the wife, dude.  You're right. 
[01:59:30]  It's the wife.  He knew he had to go home.  He knew he had to go home.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy said it.  Yeah.  He knew he had to go home and face his wife.  And it would have been this big thing, like, how could you let him sit?  Look into our baby's eyes.  No, and he told me that he had trouble with his wife, him talking about her on the air  and stuff.  Look, I say horrible things about my kids and my wife, and I go home and I take it  like a man.  Right.  But you know what, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We take a break.  Yeah, we really have to take a break.  But very interesting stuff. 
[02:00:00]  Louis C.K.  Louis, you're promoting what?  What are you promoting?  I'm going to be in Cleveland on February 15th.  Yeah.  The night before, the 14th, I'm in Buffalo at the whatever arts center.  Say hi to Buffalo.  We're on the edge right now, man.  And then I'm at Wilkes Bar in Pennsylvania on March 7th.  All right.  Can I plug my Cleveland?  Kenny, where am I in Cleveland?  Real quick.  Right in front of you.  Don't scream at me and humiliate me.  Just tell me.  Right in front of you.  I don't know where that is.  By the way, the number people are asking for, 1-800-348-1007 for The Maxwell Show. 
[02:00:30]  I'm doing two shows, Friday, February 29th, The House of Blues.  I know.  They're both sold out.  So I wanted to invite Stansberry to one of those shows.  Honest to God, not in some conference.  I don't think he'll come.  Not to be confrontational.  None of that stuff.  But you are welcome to come to the show.  I hope he comes to my show, too.  I really did.  Listening to all the clips on that, I was really impressed by you.  I really respect the guy for that.  This is not a sarcastic invitation, even though I know you won't accept it.  I'm just letting you know that Stansberry, this is a real invitation.  Basically, Maxwell's holding you back. 
[02:01:00]  It's very obvious to all of us.  We're all in Cleveland.  We're not scared of this dumb radio show.  We're kind of looking out for your future.  Well, obviously, his boss, I think that's where it's headed.  His boss will get rid of Maxwell and give this other guy the job.  And it'll actually be a decent show.  All right.  Very good.  It'll be like your sister's show in Buffalo.  We're Cleveland.  We're all in Cleveland.  You idiot.  These little cities don't matter.  You're an idiot.  You all live in places that don't matter to me. 
[02:01:30]  You get lake snow, die.  It's so weird, though, that we're all in Cleveland in February.  Really?  That's right.  We are.  It sure is.  Bob Kelly, where are you going to be in Cleveland?  We're going to be back in just a minute.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Got to go right to the phones on the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Tom in Franklin Square.  We got a report from the front lines.  Tom, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  What's up, man?  I don't know.  I just pulled up the edge that Maxwell works for. 
[02:02:00]  I really don't even know.  To be completely honest.  And we know our competition, but for Cleveland, we don't know because we don't really look at  it as competition.  I'm sorry.  To the Maxwell show.  All right.  Screeners answering the phone.  And he goes, listen, I'm tired of you douchebags following me.  He's not in until last of noon.  Oh, he's on the screen.  His show's at 3 p.m.  Yeah, the screener.  I'm sorry, guys.  I gave the number.  Let me say, if you live in Cleveland and you're hearing this, call 1-800-348-1007. 
[02:02:30]  Anywhere else in the country, he's on 3 to 7 Cleveland time.  Yeah, but that shouldn't stop anyone.  Call now.  Okay.  Just make their freaking day miserable.  It's clearly they've irritated somebody.  Yeah.  We're all about irritating somebody.  We don't care who.  You've got a chance to irritate somebody.  Call 1-800-348-1007.  If you'd like to be part of the group, call you douchebags by that fellow.  And let's see if they go with it today.  But of course they won't because they don't got it in them.  No.  Thank you, Tom. 
[02:03:00]  Thank you, Tom.  All right, real fast.  Ryan in Atlanta, Georgia.  Ryan.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I wanted to say that Maxwell's in fact wrong because as South Park told us, AIDS is funny.  Yeah, freaking South Park has fun with the AIDS thing.  Yeah, is he criticizing?  What was his family?  You have AIDS.  You have AIDS.  Or any of the other shows.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Fat man.  All right.  He proved our point.  We've got Bob Kelly in the studio.  And I took a phone call from Bob Kelly yesterday.  And it was very interesting hearing him talk about this big patch loss. 
[02:03:30]  You are really bummed out.  And then I was on the phone with you explaining the play because you still haven't seen the play.  I haven't seen.  Are you kidding me, baby?  Hang on one second.  All right, Anthony.  You mean the one where he's watching a beheading video?  You know what, though?  It kind of is.  It actually, I haven't seen anything from halfway through the fourth quarter.  I haven't watched any footage.  But your Pats are in the Super Bowl. 
[02:04:00]  I know it's pretty tough to watch your team trying to win a championship.  But isn't that what you're looking forward to the entire season?  Why would you turn off the game in the fourth quarter?  Because I knew they were going to lose.  And I just couldn't take it.  I kept going.  I looked around at my family.  And they were just ridiculous Irish, Italian, Boston people.  Just, what's going on?  Brady, what?  We're out of the room.  He's out.  Oh, just screaming.  I mean, it's just.  Then I understand why you left the room. 
[02:04:30]  I had to leave.  Because you're a bummer family.  I had to watch Dallas lose to Dwight Clark, the catch.  I had to watch Jackie Smith drop that pass in the end zone to Pittsburgh.  And Dallas stays this amazing comeback.  And they would have went ahead if he didn't drop that pass.  And you know how I feel.  Horrendous.  And you know how I feel.  Bob, I'm from Boston.  I'm a huge Pats fan.  And I really enjoyed that game.  It was a great game.  I actually enjoyed watching them get beat that way.  And you actually came to my mind.  Because you're the type of guy, though.  I said, you had a Yankee cap on one day and a Red Sox. 
[02:05:00]  You're like, I don't care.  I just wear a hat.  I like good sports.  I like the story of sports.  But you see, that's when I realized that my family brought me up into a cult.  And I have a triangle head logo on my shirt.  And I am a member of a cult.  And I have no decision making of my own.  And it felt like the only thing I can equate it to, really, is when I got arrested.  And the finality of, hey, I'm arrested.  But there's always that chant.  The cop's talking to you a little nice. 
[02:05:30]  So mean.  And then you go in the car.  And it's like, well, hey, we'll bring you back.  But then when they shut the door and you're there,  you're like, this is real.  I'm not getting away.  It's not changing.  And you still go, please, something's going to happen.  And nothing happens.  Yes, something's going to happen.  All right.  I actually got yesterday.  They found a video where they stopped the clock.  And they weren't supposed to stop the clock.  Right.  And that would have been the end of the game.  Right.  And I actually got hope.  Like, maybe they'll reverse it.  I thought that, too.  I thought that when everybody was jumping around and there was still one second. 
[02:06:00]  I saw that.  I was like, hey, something.  Maybe there's something.  Something could happen.  Bobo, when you watch this play, this is like.  Watch the play for the first time.  It's one of those plays.  This is so weird.  You haven't seen this ridiculous catch yet.  You can't even get mad.  No, that's the thing.  When that happened, I thought, oh, give it to the Giants now.  You can't even get mad.  After it happened, I said, I go, they have to now win this.  You don't make a play like this and then lose the game.  Yeah, there's no way they were going to lose after that.  So, yeah, Bobby, step up there.  Notice.  This is the real deal.  He has not seen this play yet. 
[02:06:30]  Notice the almost.  Because it's not just the pass, the reception.  It's the pass also.  So, notice it's almost a sack.  Yes.  Obviously.  Where is this in the game?  This is like.  Fourth quarter.  It's the end.  This is the final drive.  This is the final drive.  This is the Giants' last touchdown.  This is the play that.  We're winning right now.  Yeah.  We're winning by 14.  And then after this touchdown.  Well, we're not going to show this touchdown.  The famous catch.  No, but this is the play that made it possible.  And then.  Third down?  Yeah, third and five. 
[02:07:00]  It's third.  And this is going to go down as one of the most amazing plays in Super Bowl history.  Play for Bob.  Play for Bobbo.  Watch.  Now watch how he gets in the grasp.  Almost.  He's almost down.  Look at this.  Look at this.  He gets out the pass and on his head.  That's great.  What is that?  At three frames per second?  Yeah, I know.  Is it because you made a slide show?  We just watched a slide show.  Make the screen small.  He can still see it.  Do you understand bandwidth?  All right. 
[02:07:30]  There's the catch.  Look.  On his helmet, one hand as he's falling backwards.  And then he has amazing abs by keeping that ball from touching the ground.  From touching the ground.  All right.  That's all abs work.  He did a sit-up.  That's all crunches.  That's all crunches.  Well, because he has his legs off the ground.  All the things that your awful trainer makes you do.  He keeps his legs off the ground.  That's how you lost the Super Bowl right there, Bobbo.  That was it right there.  There's no way he should have made that catch.  I mean, you...  There's no way he should have made that catch.  God!  It's on top of his helmet.  God!  Look how close it was.  If he had touched the ground, he's dead.  Yeah.  And he went, oh, with his abs. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  And he squeezed, crunched back in.  Did a crunch.  Yeah!  God!  And he saved the game.  That was the...  And there's the Super Bowl.  At that point, it doesn't matter.  That one moment is the difference.  Between the legacy of undefeated...  I'm not even busting your chops, but in that moment, that's where it is.  Yeah, but this is the problem, is that, okay...  Look, here it is again.  And there's somebody there that could have just knocked that right out of his hand.  Just sickening.  And this is what makes me think that sports...  There's got to be something.  I mean... 
[02:08:30]  Look at us.  Look at us.  Look at us.  You know what?  Why the Giants?  Why him?  I'm with you, man.  I'm with you, Bobby.  50...  What, 85?  Who cares about him?  It's a great story.  It's a great story.  It's a great story.  How is it great?  Because it came out of nowhere.  Let me ask what story's better.  No.  What story's better?  Tom Brady, perfect specimen.  Oh, so what?  So what?  Winning four, going out in the Super Bowl, going 18-0.  I mean, 19-0.  Way cooler.  Way cooler.  You know the ball was slapped.  Way cooler that he got that close. 
[02:09:00]  Look at this.  The ball was slapped, too, but he wasn't able to slap it completely out of his hand.  It got on his helmet.  Which means that guy's got ridiculous fingertip strength.  Watch this.  See, this is where he should have collapsed backwards.  And he went...  He's got a hernia now.  He popped something.  He's got a hole in somewhere.  Here's the thing.  For them to go 18-0 to get that close, and then for this guy's, a real quarterback's  little brother to bring a team out of nowhere, to take a team out of nowhere and beat the 
[02:09:30]  unbeatable is really cool.  It just wasn't for that.  And it's a great Boston, New York thing, because I wear a Red Sox cap all over New York, and  guys give me crap all day.  And I take it.  I don't care.  But after we won the World Series, all construction workers, cops, firemen, all the toughest New  York guys would come up to me with really serious and go, congratulations, sir.  They call me sir.  Congratulations.  They just felt like they owed it to me to say congrats to their bitterest rival.  And I really respected that. 
[02:10:00]  And after this game, I took the subway home.  There was all these Giants fans, and I had the cap on, and they all looked at me like,  ah, and I said, congratulations, gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  And they were like, thank you, sir.  It was like, they were out there.  The weird thing is, just to tell Bob, too, there was an interception dropped.  Like, Eli threw an interception here on this drive, I believe, and it was dropped.  The guy had it and dropped it.  And if he caught that ball, this play never would have happened.  Yeah, but this is the point, is that they had you all, if they lost two or three games, 
[02:10:30]  it might be a different story.  It wouldn't probably hurt as bad.  But the fact that they sucked you along all year, and they got you to the end.  That's what makes it great.  And they actually lost this way.  If they got blown out, it would have been different.  But to lose in some fluke fashion.  It's not a fluke.  It's great football.  That catch is a fluke.  If I'm with Bobby, he meant to catch it.  Well, I guess, but that's, come on.  So there is to it.  That's a fluke, dude.  The odds that him, first of all, Eli getting out of that situation, making the throw, 
[02:11:00]  and that 85, son of a gun.  Yeah, you can say son of a bitch.  No, but that's all athletic greatness.  That is not a...  To have the timing with your hands to catch the ball when you can't see it on your head.  Watch Eli get out of the red.  To hold on to it and to know that you need to keep your abs tight to keep the ball from touching the ground.  That guy's name is David Tyree, by the way. 
[02:11:30]  Can I say, David Tyree, first of all, if the guy went to slap it out of his hand,  if he wasn't underneath him and he fell on the ground, guaranteed his ab muscles wouldn't work  and that ball would have flown out of his hand.  No, that's true, and I think they should give the Patriots the win based on what you're saying.  That's what I'm saying.  We should go back and review this.  And it would have been easier if your Pats were, what, like, I don't know, 14-4 for the year or something.  14-4.  Dude, 14-4.  Then it wouldn't have hurt as much, but... 
[02:12:00]  That's the thing, too, is that they've always been the underdog.  They've always been rocky.  It can't be 14-4.  14-5.  They've always been rocky.  Someone's going to call us out on that.  And you know what?  It's almost good because as fans growing up, I've always been a hunk of crap.  I've always, we're going to lose, we're going to lose.  And it almost makes you feel better when you win or when you lose, you can deal with it.  But for the last, from 2000 on...  Yeah, we're winners now.  We've been winners, and this is what Yankee fans must have felt like in 2004. 
[02:12:30]  Yes.  New York beat us.  Which is devastating.  Yes.  By the way, you were never a winner.  No.  They were.  The New England Patriots, you're not a member of the...  You're not actually on the team.  I do want to point that out.  Yeah, but they did congratulate you.  I had the shirt on.  Like, you were on the team.  That's true.  When you were telling your little story.  You were on the team.  I was going to ask you...  I think I could take more credit than Bob.  I was going to ask you what your average was for the World Series in 2004.  Oh, yeah, we've got to play Everyone Has AIDS from Team America because AIDS isn't funny, right? 
[02:13:00]  No.  Yeah, we'll leave with that song.  Plugs.  Louis, Cleveland, Buffalo.  Cleveland on the 15th of February, Buffalo the 14th, and then Wilkes Bar March 7th.  I was talking to the PD in Buffalo at the edge.  They're very excited to have you.  I can't wait.  Extremely.  Make sure you do Shred.  I've never played Buffalo.  Make sure you do Shred and Reagan.  I've done it on the radio.  Those guys are awesome.  They're a real show.  They talk with their real voices, and they'll tell you to go after yourself if they don't  like you in person.  I've got to plug something, too.  Sure.  Both shows tonight at Bananas and Poughkeepsie are sold out.  I mean, tomorrow night are sold out, so there might be some seats available tonight. 
[02:13:30]  Both shows tomorrow are sold.  And noon today, tickets for the second half of my tour go on sale.  That's Seattle, Portland, Detroit, Chicago.  All go on sale at noon today.  Go to my MySpace.com, Jim Norton.  All the information is there.  And I'm really going to try to go to one of the shows this weekend.  You should, man.  You should come.  Will you have seats for me and, like, three other people?  Yes.  I'll make sure there's seats.  All right.  Bobby?  Bobby?  I'm going to be at Cleveland at the end of the month, at the Cleveland Improv. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  Very good.  We're heading over to XM.  I don't know what happens at this station here in New York after we leave.  No clue.  Maybe they're playing music.  Maybe they're starting the country station today.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Stay tuned to find out here in New York City.  We leave you with this for Maxwell, who doesn't know what funny is.  We'll see you guys on Monday.  We'll see you guys on Monday. 
[02:14:30]  We'll see you guys on Monday.  Well, I'm going to march on Washington.  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us. 
[02:15:00]  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS.  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Gays and the straights and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS.  My grandma and my dog go blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The Pope has got AIDS and so do you.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Come on, everybody.  We got quilting to do.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  We're going to break down these barricades, everyone.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:15:30]  Shock jerks.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:00]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:00]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:18:00]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:18:30]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:19:00]  They do.  I have heard it.  It's the one where you must have gotten the date wrong and they had to dub in the proper date. 
[02:19:30]  Well, you just don't know how to promote because the point I'm making is that you tell everyone,  all your fans, to get the brand new Bob Kelly CD at Tower Records.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  And that's where it should be sold.  Well, no.  There is a Tower Records.  I'm talking about this.  It's also available at Woolworths.  Wolco.  It's not the Tower Records you're talking about.  It's the Tower Records with two W's.  It's down in the village.  How about Tower Airlines?  Can you get on there, too? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, shit.  Swim walk.  You take Pan Am.  Next time you fly Pan Am.  Yeah.  There's no Tower Records.  Eastern Airlines.  Well, the wings of men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  You're right, Opie.  I have to agree with you.  I don't know how to really promote records.  I don't know how to really promote records.  But I'm learning.  All right.  Also, another thing coming in.  I love the listeners.  They're a bunch of tattletales.  This guy writes, Mike B. from South Carolina.  Opie, could you please tell Steve C. that when he makes promos, just because he can curse 
[02:20:30]  every other word doesn't mean he should.  That's right.  What promo is he cursing at?  I got to hear this now.  Steve is a bag of shit.  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  Let's hear it, Butcher.  Count the curses.  You too.  If those albums come out.  Not that one.  Not that one.  Just the tip.  It did that bit already.  The one where Steve curses, please.  God damn it, man.  Jimmy was right.  This is the day everyone is paying attention to us.  Mm-hmm.  We got all sorts of things.  We got a lot of hooks in the water right now.  This is the time we need to sound great. 
[02:21:00]  Mm-hmm.  Then we can go back to being lazy.  We'll be back to being lazy in no time.  But the next week or so, we got to be sharp.  On your toes.  Sharp as a tech.  Or we freeze your balls with that poo freezer that we were playing with today.  I watched the dirty talk.  All right.  Butcher, you ready?  Take two.  When's the last time you went to OpieAndAnthony.com?  Holy shit!  It's been that long?  Well, get the fuck over there right now.  We just added a brand new section called Old School Opie and Anthony. 
[02:21:30]  It's going to be old bits.  It could be from our CDs that we released.  I'm scared.  It could be old publicity shots.  All that crap.  Oh, no.  No.  So there's all brand new shit that's going to be highlighted every fucking day on OpieAndAnthony.com.  So go there now.  Not a lot of curses.  You know what?  I'm going to defend you.  Just four curses.  I got a defense team.  Motherfucking cunts.  They were not needed, though.  Oh.  I'll go in there.  I'll fucking...  You'd use the same... 
[02:22:00]  I'll go in there and record a classier one in three seconds.  There's no reason.  OpieAndAnthony.com now has this section called what?  Old School Opie.  You know, I don't like the way he's cursing during the promos.  Who's this faggot from North Carolina who didn't like it?  Who's this fucking...  Unnecessary.  Fucking fell out of his mother's cunt and decided to bother us with this?  Well, we loved, you know, the tattletales, actually.  But that one just fell flat.  Louie, what can I tell you? 
[02:22:30]  I would love to beat up Steve again.  Trust me.  Trust me.  It did sound a little desperate.  Like, oh, we've got to make sure people that like cursing hear my cursing.  But only four.  They let 400 people go at CBS Radio yesterday.  And I'm looking.  I'm like three or four times.  Like, where's Steve's name on this list?  See, what he's trying to get at is I'm awfully incompetent.  Right, I understand.  And then I'm thinking maybe Steve Carlisi is his radio name.  So then I'm looking for other Steves that were fired that could possibly be Steve. 
[02:23:00]  Saying I don't deserve exactly what it is that I'm doing here.  See, Steve thinks he's got this figured out how to get by this abuse.  Right, by running it.  It's never going to work.  It's never going to work.  So whether I give in to it or try to fight it, I'm always a bag of shit.  You can't fucking fight it.  What he's trying to do now is be like in that movie Red October when there's a missile  headed towards the submarine, a torpedo.  So he heads for the torpedo.  Yeah.  Hoping that he'll hit it before it arms.  God damn, that's a good reference.  That's a very good reference.  Commie fag.  There's a lot of. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Commie fag.  Is that what you're calling me?  Let's say hi to Dennis in New Jersey.  Dennis.  Hey, what's up, guys?  By the way, you know how I was talking about how the show's going to be really good and  we can't be lazy?  The listener's got to help, too.  Yeah, fucking chime in when you hear your name.  It can't be lazy.  When you hear your name, it might be your turn to talk.  Right.  You guys got to be sharp and ready to go, too, because you're very important to this radio  show.  Everyone's got to be sharp.  Atta boy, Ope.  Dennis, go. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  I just have a question for Louie.  Yes?  Did you have sex with your wife yet?  What?  Did you have sex with your wife yet?  Well, I have two kids, so clearly, yes.  No, no, no, no, no.  On prior show, you said it was like two or three months you had sex.  No, there's no ticking clock here.  It's a cemented vagina.  There's nothing going in.  I mean, I don't know what.  It's nothing that's any of my business. 
[02:24:30]  I don't know what she keeps up there.  It ain't my dick.  It's got nothing to do with me.  What is that?  What is that thing with tubes?  Are we allowed to talk about that?  I don't know.  It's got nothing to do.  It's like I have less to do with my wife's vagina.  When you walk into a Korean grocery or something, and they're selling DVDs of Korean movies  for Korean people, that's got nothing to do with me.  That's how much, that's my relationship with my wife's vagina is like whatever.  It's just a whole area that I'm like, oh, I guess something's going on in there.  But it ain't you. 
[02:25:00]  It ain't me.  I got another request, too.  Sure.  I'm glad I got the participants in studio today.  Less ass-fucking on the...  It was fun for a while.  I think I'm talking for a lot of listeners right now.  I know.  They're talking.  It was a lot of fun, but they play those things like...  Look, it's not up to us how often they get played.  And it's getting a little creepy now, you guys.  Bob has only fucked me up the ass while I promoted my shows twice.  I only do it.  First of all, I only fuck him in the ass to help him sell tickets. 
[02:25:30]  I asked him to do it.  The first time he did it, he did it.  It was spontaneous.  It's very spontaneous.  The second time I said, listen, I've got to promote my shows.  Will you fuck me up the ass again?  Yeah.  But you guys are the ones that play it a thousand times.  He gets really into it, though, Bobby.  The first time, it was very...  I mean, almost...  It was very...  I mean, he was just doing it.  I was there.  I ripped his pants down.  I just plugged it in.  Almost like Brokeback Mountain.  Yeah, yeah.  Just spitting up on my hand.  Yeah.  And just pushed it in.  And he didn't know what was going on.  He just went with it.  No, it was great.  I think that's really the nature of that kind of thing.  Yeah.  The first time, it was like this kind of sudden, unexpected... 
[02:26:00]  And then any time that happens in your life sexually, and you go back and go,  can we do that again?  The second time, you're always like, well, I got nothing to say now.  It's just a bummer.  How about another concept for you guys?  Try something else.  I think it's time.  It got weird at the last time, because after I fucked him, I go, will you fuck me in the  ass while I do mine?  He goes, no.  No.  And I was like...  It's about my dates, not yours.  Yeah.  You are done.  Exactly.  And it goes on a long time.  I came. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, maybe a quickie would have been...  I got a big tour.  I mean, there's a lot of dates.  And I got a huge car.  It goes on forever.  What's this dumb thing in front of you?  Bob.  Is that yours, Bob?  What is it, a colostomy bag?  That was a great one, Jim.  What is it?  Oh, Jimmy, that was good.  What's this big dumb thing in front of you, Bob?  Good.  I didn't mean that, Bob.  It's actually...  It's right here.  It's so you can have a woman with like a small titties. 
[02:27:00]  You can put this on.  With a small titties?  With a small titties, you 80-year-old negro.  Well, shit, no.  A small titty.  A small titty.  A woman with a small titty.  Curtis Lowe.  A woman who has breast cancer and has one small tit.  You can put this on and pump it up.  How do you get this?  Now, that's not funny.  Breast cancer.  Not funny.  Not funny.  It's not funny.  Not funny.  You know, I got to say something.  I got morals.  I got ethics.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I sell alcohol on my show, and a lot of people drunk, drive, and kill children. 
[02:27:30]  You fucking fat cunts.  You witless fat cunts.  I hope he dies in a bus shooting.  I hope he's on a bus.  A bus shooting.  A fucking disgruntled person gets on and thinks he's Donald Pleasance and shoots him.  Escape from New York.  I hope there's a helicopter hovering when it happens.  Yeah, we...  And people just see the glass kind of...  You can't really put limits on the show.  ...blow out of the red mist.  You can't put limits on...  You can't put limits on comedy, especially when you do a radio show. 
[02:28:00]  There's stuff that we joke about, and it affects me, like, personally, but whatever.  I mean...  It makes me sick, though, and it's so nice.  Who am I to say that you shouldn't laugh at something that might have been horrifying to me?  It's narcissistic to go, like...  Yes.  To spend your whole life not really caring if somebody makes fun of children or something,  and then you have one, and then go, hold on a second.  Now I can't do this anymore.  I have a fucking bag of salt water that you should care about.  It's like Louie's refreshing.  A bag of salt water.  That's all the baby is. 
[02:28:30]  People have kids and turn into these fucking assholes.  No, you didn't have kids before, so why weren't you outraged then?  Because it didn't affect your stupid shit life that nobody cares about.  Right.  Now you have a little faggot that you're raising.  That, by the way, isn't fucking special.  No, it's not.  Well, that's the thing, though, about comedy is that most people think like you,  I hate this little hunk of shit.  Yeah.  What a pain in the ass.  No, and also, when you're in the audience, you have somebody who died of cancer in your life.  Right.  And then I make a cancer joke, somebody else does, and you go, I wish I hadn't heard that. 
[02:29:00]  I understand that.  Right.  But all the other people in the room, every other joke was about something that bummed somebody out.  Yeah.  The whole point of comedy is saying something that was not really polite to say.  That's the entire point of it.  And you'll laugh if it didn't affect you personally.  Fine.  And that's 99% of the people, but that one person, he's going to laugh at the other shit.  If I'm watching a movie or a TV show and they put a child in jeopardy, I change the channel.  I can't watch it.  Really?  I can't.  I can't personally.  Love that shit.  But I totally recognize that that's just my problem because I immediately go to thinking 
[02:29:30]  about my kid being missing or something.  Is that true?  I thought that was only in the movies.  I can't take watching that.  I can't even watch Terms of Endearment when they're at the...  And he's like, I'll put my candy bar back.  I'm like, I got to shut it off.  You're just a crybaby when it comes to that.  Why?  Fucking hilarious movie.  Yeah, there's a lot of comedy in that box.  Exactly.  Can we get someone to wear this weird titty apparatus?  Yeah.  It's so that women can store alcohol in it. 
[02:30:00]  What?  Is it really?  That's why it's called The Wine Rack.  See?  Ew.  It's about booze.  Holy shit.  The Wine Rack.  It's so like they can get into a concert with some wine, basically?  Yeah, I guess.  That's cool.  Somewhere.  Is this a real sponsor?  Sneak it.  Drink it.  That's what it says on there.  It's not really very subtle.  We should fill it with loads.  Sneak it.  That's just not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  Loads on titties. 
[02:30:30]  It's not funny.  We should sneak it into a New Kids in the Block concert with all the little kids and just  have her just guzzle and load in the front row.  Wow.  Jesus, Bob.  I'm really not sure that...  Well, you've adapted to the product to your own use.  Yeah.  Not funny.  It's not funny.  And where's that cunt in the studio to chime in and go, I agree?  I agree.  I agree.  That's all she had.  She had it a lot, by the way.  Of course, that's all she had.  They're not a sponsor, so why fuck with them?  Oh, wait. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, wait.  I think that's your cue.  No, I mean, if it was a sponsor, we'd be all over.  Wine rack.  We just do things a little differently here.  We shit on the sponsors, and they come back for more, which amazes me.  Many pays for those awful plugs we do every morning on the other side.  We know how to sell.  That's right.  I'll sell anything.  That's right.  Honey, they're just joking.  I'll sell the fucking thing.  That's right.  You bring me a fat fuck with breathing apparatus and an unfunny cunt in the studio and a guy  that he's making uncomfortable, I'll sell that, too.  I sell Paul.  We got a couple things I want to get to. 
[02:31:30]  We got guest a singer.  We also have this tasing where the guy sounded like Chewbacca.  It's worth playing one more time today.  Tasing.  It's great.  Listen to this one.  We love tase clips or tasering clips or whatever.  Sure.  But this one is just one of the better ones.  Tasing, tasing, tasing.  That's amazing.  It sounds like every one of Jimmy's punchlines. 
[02:32:00]  That does seem like he's being tased with a load in his throat.  It's weird because...  Tasing, tasing, tasing.  It's weird because it matches the frequency of the taser.  Yeah, of the taser going.  It's like he was tased while he was talking into a fan.  Tased into a fan. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, so could they turn it up and have it go...  They totally could have played him with that taser.  Like a Furman or what I was...  I was terrific.  Furman.  Those...  Yeah, that organ from...  Yeah.  Where you kind of put your hand around a rod.  Yeah.  We got Guess the Singer or Willie Nelson talking about 9-11.  Willie Nelson's a douche.  Does he say anything surprising?  Does he say anything you wouldn't have expected him to say?  Yeah, actually it is a little hot even though I know he smokes a lot of pot.  He's one of those dudes, Louie.  Oh no.  We're learning that he's one of those dudes. 
[02:33:00]  That it was planted, detonation...  Oh.  Fucking Willie Nelson.  We've had him on the show.  One of those.  What's your take on 9-11?  Do you question the official story?  I certainly...  Is this man-cow audio?  No.  No, it's not man-cow.  Who's the guy?  There's a lot of man-cow sounding coaches out there.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  What's your take on 9-11?  Do you question the official story?  I certainly do.  And I saw those towers fall and I've seen an implosion in Las Vegas. 
[02:33:30]  There was too much similarities between the two.  Right.  Buildings fell.  And I saw the building fall.  It didn't get hit by nothing.  So, you know, how naive are we?  You know, what do they think we'll go for?  What, it did get hit by nothing?  Are you saying you started having...  It also takes like six months to prepare that building to fall like that.  It's not like they just go in that day, hook up some dynamite, and then it falls perfectly.  It's the most witnessed crime in the history of existence. 
[02:34:00]  Of existence.  And people are still like...  They're still...  I don't know, though.  I mean...  No, man.  Could have been something.  I was like, look, see?  You see sparks coming out the window as it's...  Yeah, because it's a building falling.  It's made of metal and concrete.  I was talking to see sparks, dummy.  I was talking to Anthony yesterday because this came up and we're finally bringing it on the show.  Right now, I got some douche above me just tapping in nails, and I want to go up there and strangle them.  And I go, I can't even concentrate with a lousy hammer, and they're small nails. 
[02:34:30]  You can tell, but they're nailing everything up there.  And they were supposed to sneak around a fucking building and jack hammers, drilling holes and supporting concrete and steel.  No.  And not going to notice the dust everywhere.  Even if they, quote, did it in the middle of the night when no one was there, they were going to sweep up everything.  There were cables that would come out in a snake that would have to be a foot in diameter.  It's just funny because I remember watching it and thinking, engineering-wise, what was happening made sense to me.  Which is that the top half started wobbling and that that's not supposed to happen to a building. 
[02:35:00]  And that once the top half started to fall upon itself, it's like they dropped the upper part of the World Trade Center on the rest of the World Trade Center.  And it crumbled down.  If gravity dictates it will go in a straight line down.  Yeah, it's straight down.  It's not going to go over for any reason.  There's no force pushing it on the side.  No.  It's pushing down.  A lot of people really thought it was going to just, yeah, just tumble over that way.  It's impossible.  Yeah, it would be great if Al-Qaeda, somebody like Bin Laden, just came on TV to say, no, we totally did do it. 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  Yeah, they must be pissed.  They're like, thank you for the credit.  Motherfucker, we did that.  It was so much work.  Yeah.  You know what we went through?  Maybe if Cloverfield tilted, pushed the tower over.  Yeah, if Cloverfield monster pushes a building, it'll fall over.  But that's what they wanted, too.  The terrorists wanted it to fall over onto other buildings, and they were probably bummed out that it didn't.  Yeah.  A little bit, sure.  Willie Nelson is a fucking dummy.  Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. 
[02:36:00]  Here's Willie Nelson.  He didn't get hit by nothing, so how naive are we?  What do they think we'll go for?  So are you saying you started having questions or that little voice in your head?  I mean, did you have a bad feeling the day it happened?  Is that what you're saying?  The day it happened, I saw one fall, and it was just so symmetrical.  I said, wait a minute, I just saw that last week at the casino over in Las Vegas, and you see these implosions all the time, and the next one fell. 
[02:36:30]  I said, hell, there's another one.  And they're trying to tell me that an airplane did it.  And that's, you know, I can't go along with that.  And then you find out that mainstream news reported, but it never got any attention, that the supposed hijackers were given national security clearance and were trained at U.S. bases,  and the dean of the defense language school, Colonel Butler, goes public and says, we train these people, the government's involved, and they start court-martialing him until he agreed to shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  What?  Who is this asshole?  You know what's funny about who is this asshole?  No. 
[02:37:00]  Sounds just like man-cowl.  Everyone online is, on his feedback, is telling us who this asshole is.  Man-cowl, Bubba the Love Sponge.  Is it Neil Bortz?  No, but they're mentioning that Humphrey dude, Rusty Humphreys, man-cowl.  Like, it's the same voice.  Alex Jones.  That's what these guys are.  They all sound like the same guys.  That's what I'm saying.  They all sound like the same, and everyone thinks they know who this guy is.  We, uh, we, uh, you know, I talk like this when I'm home.  He sounds like he's about to say, Willie, that's not funny.  It's not funny, Willie.  Well, when was that audio from, though? 
[02:37:30]  In fairness to him, was that, like, right after 9-11?  When was it?  Yesterday.  No.  No.  If you came out right after 9-11 and said shit like this, you'd be fucking exiled.  Yeah.  You know what happened to the Chixie Dicks, remember?  They fucking said something?  The Chixie Dicks?  I said that on purpose.  Thank you for noticing.  They fucking, you know, criticized Bush a little too close to 9-11.  They were crucified.  Uh, no, this is all new shit.  Stupid Willie. 
[02:38:00]  Go smoke a fucking joint and not pay your taxes.  I'm sorry I'm not buying it, asshole.  I'm sorry I'm not buying it.  Well, it's a good thing it doesn't matter whether you buy it or not.  Holy shit.  Willie Nelson's on to us.  It's time.  All right.  We're going to make a major announcement this evening on the news.  Here's the stupid part of it.  The thing that the other guy's saying, I can't, I have no idea if any of that's true,  but maybe the government did 9-11, it's possible, but at least admit that they did it by throwing  planes at the buildings.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, why do you need to make it?  The planes are a nice touch. 
[02:38:30]  What are they, stupid?  Why would they do that and then not, you know?  Yeah.  Why don't you just, it's so easy to just say the hijackers were working for the government.  That's all, that's fine.  I'll go, oh, I don't know, maybe that did happen.  Not a controlled explosion.  But we all watched the planes hit the buildings and the buildings come down.  Why do you have to say, no, they actually, some people go like, there was no planes.  There's people that say that.  There were no planes.  Is there really an eyewitness to this?  There never was a World Trade Center.  Did anyone see the planes?  Yes.  Millions of people saw it. 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  Well, they say the one that hit the Pentagon, they actually blew the Pentagon up themselves  because there's no footage of the plane.  Yes, there is.  Actually.  There is.  There is.  I know there is.  Security camera.  They say that it isn't.  So, relax.  All right, Tony, relax.  I told you there was, Bob.  Bob's always arguing that point.  And there's light poles that are sheared off and there's a big fenced in generator that  one of the tail, the tail hit.  They know exactly where it came in, exactly how it hit.  The reason why they're like, because they didn't find pieces of it, like on Lost, that 
[02:39:30]  it didn't happen.  Yeah.  Yep.  You're a gatekeeper.  You remember that jerk off?  Oh, yeah.  Little boy.  Little boy didn't like his point of view not being, not being angry.  Then he got all violent and yelling.  Stop the angry young man thing, sweetie.  Stop.  That's what it is.  It's usually some douchebags.  You know, this is how people argue.  That's why I don't like argue on the internet with people anymore.  Because whatever you tell people, it's like, well, it was on national TV and we all  watch.  You know, it might or not.  I can believe what I want to believe.  All right.  Go ahead. 
[02:40:00]  Go ahead.  Believe it.  Well, doesn't it bother you that?  Believe your parents raised a douche.  No, it doesn't.  Because I've read the explanation for that.  And they didn't find any aircraft parts at the Pentagon.  Yes, they did.  Yes, they did.  What are you going to say to that?  Yes, they did.  Here's the pictures of it.  Here's a firefighter standing next to a turbine that matches this plane.  No.  How do you argue that?  That's exactly what they say.  No.  No.  Years ago.  This is where I really learned about people and how useless they are. 
[02:40:30]  I was in Boston.  Fucking Lloyd.  Years ago.  I was in a bar.  And there's a story on the news on the TV at the bar about the stealth bomber.  Remember the stealth bomber?  Yep.  The invisible bomber.  And this guy at the end of this Boston retard at the end of the bar goes, he goes, it doesn't  work.  I'm like, what?  Stealth bomb doesn't work.  Doesn't work.  Why do you say?  Because the Russians got infrared.  Doesn't work.  Infrared.  This is like a $3 billion airplane. 
[02:41:00]  Infrared.  And they worked on it forever.  And they used some of Hitler's science.  Yeah.  And there's dudes whose brains are bizarrely amazing that made this thing.  And technology from a clicker can find it.  This fucking Irish cunt in Boston.  All they had to do was ask him.  He's sitting at the end of the bar with the real, doesn't work.  Doesn't work.  Oh, it doesn't fucking asshole.  People think they know anything. 
[02:41:30]  Dude, the problem with infrared is that they can use it.  But Bob, what about, don't talk to me, dude.  I rehearsed this alone.  No.  They should have heard me in the car after the Super Bowl.  Alone, right?  Dude.  Dude, it's not, you know what, dude.  Dude, it was destiny.  It was the big picture.  You know, that was ours to lose, dude.  Shut up.  I wish you were false, but you're absolutely right.  Of course I'm right. 
[02:42:00]  You know, fucking dude.  They just, you know.  I'd love to hear you justifying that Patriots loss to yourself.  Dude, I mean, fucking Brady, the fucking guy.  Giselle, dude.  Why do you have to bring you what could have been, except post to what really is?  Perfect season.  Yeah, dude.  What's a better story?  That happening?  Or me being killed while I'm talking to myself?  Dude.  Oh, what a fucking fool you are. 
[02:42:30]  Amazingly good.  Just looks up so there's no interruptions and distractions.  Just like when he's alone in the shower watching this filthy asshole with his fucking eight jets  and his stupid fucking civil rights footage fire hose toilet.  Fuck you.  His bidet, his mechanical automatic fucking R2-D2 shitter.  You think it's not queer because it's water or not a dick?  Think again, fruit.  I actually cut the hose and made the water bigger. 
[02:43:00]  That's right, and you put a little dye in there so it can be like, oh, shit, swimwalk.  No, it's a black guy's water.  Well, at least I didn't make it piss.  You'd reroute yours from the toilet bowl itself.  Bob.  Well, some of them are winners.  Some of them are...  Dude, I was on the show.  I said something funny, and then they didn't do it.  They fucking, you know what, dude?  They won't laugh if it's about them or Norton.  Let's play a guest-a-singer. 
[02:43:30]  Kim Carnes.  I was walking on the ground.  I didn't make a sound, man.  I turned around, and I saw a clown.  Had a frown.  Stood on a mound.  He started barking like a hound. 
[02:44:00]  This is awful.  When I came to it, I found he showed me something that was frown.  So he became great friends, and late in life, he got sick.  I don't want to make a guess.  I just want this to stop.  Yeah?  I remember this.  You remember this?  Yeah.  You know who it is?  That guy from Back to the Future.  What's his name?  Isn't it?  Michael J. Fox?  No.  Because the microphone would have been like this. 
[02:44:30]  The guy who thinks he's weird.  Crispin Glover?  Crispin Glover.  Isn't it Crispin Glover?  Nothing.  Is it Crispin Glover?  Deserves something.  Danny?  Is it Crispin Glover?  Wow.  Wow.  That killed him.  Wow.  Great.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Crispin Glover thinks he's an artist and interesting.  Thank God.  We didn't play this on the other side.  Thank God.  That's my favorite part of the movie.  He comes walking over with that stupid pad.  I'm your density.  That's right.  We got Jimmy's comedy.  So I saw a clip from the reunion of the Family Ties cast yesterday. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  And it is painful to watch poor Michael J. Fox.  Did they use a Steadicam?  He's shaking.  That's not funny.  Not funny.  It's not funny.  We got Parkinson's.  It looks like he would be exhausted.  Like you wake up and ten minutes into your day, you're fucking exhausted.  Yeah.  Because you're just doing aerobics.  Kind of like the two-legged dog.  He's doing cardio from the time he fucking wakes up. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, like the two-legged dog.  He just looks exhausted walking around.  I saw him do an interview trying to raise money and awareness, and the camera guy was  just pissed.  You could see him just trying to focus in on one part that wasn't shaking, then it would  start shaking, then he moved to his full shot.  Well, he does this thing, Michael J. Fox, now where it looks like he's trying to get  comfortable in his chair, and he just looks like he's moving because he's fucking shaking.  He works into a kind of a Rodney Dangerfield with the tie. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, yeah, let me tell you, he's got Parkinson's.  He looks like a marionette.  Hey, Dr. Brock, can you help me out?  He looks like a marionette where the puppeteer has Parkinson's.  Or he looks like somebody naked sitting in a wool chair.  Like, you know, he's just trying to adjust it to get comfy.  Yeah, he's got to adjust it to get comfy.  Exactly.  He's like, oh, this ain't funny, ain't funny, guys.  Ain't funny.  Not funny.  My grandmother had Parkinson's.  Blah, blah, blah.  Did she?  My baby's going to get Parkinson's when it's old. 
[02:46:30]  It's not funny.  Not funny.  It's not funny.  Damien from Akron, Ohio writes, Opie, did Louie just ruin the bit by guessing right?  Yeah, he kind of did, but you know what?  Oh, were we supposed to drag that out and try to figure out who it was?  As soon as I realized it was Crispin Glover, whatever.  It's not like it was Heath Ledger.  Yeah.  I just tried to make the basket and hit your intern in the face.  Oh, good.  Why are you walking into the fucking camera?  The guy's nervous.  He just walked right into the panel. 
[02:47:00]  Which is pretty large and obvious.  It's a giant tripod.  Earthquake camera.  And fucking clumsy bumbles into it.  That was to give you the Michael J. Fox experience if you were watching him.  He's a fucking faker, though, man.  Give him a cup of hot tea.  Now straighten up, bitch.  You're going to have sore wrists.  They should give him the U2 camera so we don't all feel uncomfortable.  The what?  The what?  The U2 camera, it's called.  What's that?  Well, I mean, this isn't a bomb.  It's actually...  I don't know.  It's actually...  I'm only stopping because I'm interested. 
[02:47:30]  Uh-oh.  It's preemptive.  This isn't a bomb.  U2 fans know.  They do...  They've done videos where, like, Bono holds the camera where it's attached to him and then  he spins around so you get the perspective that Bono's not moving.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  No, that's true.  If he were that, he would seem still.  Yeah.  I wasn't going for an over-the-top laugh.  I was going for some kind of accurate...  What is that?  What is that?  I honestly don't know what it means.  It would seem...  In other words, if the camera was strapped to his head, pointed at him, he would be still  as could be.  He would seem still and the world around him would seem to shake.  Yeah.  Shake around. 
[02:48:00]  It's almost like when John Travolta and that chick in Saturday Night Fever were spinning  each other.  There you go.  That's the...  How ridiculous must they have looked spinning with the camera?  The only way I could explain it was it's the U2 camera because they've used it in  videos.  Whatever.  Exactly.  It's just awful.  But they should do that.  It'd be really interesting to seem, you know, just kind of still.  I got to spin with the camera?  Is I supposed to pretend the camera's like a chick or something?  Was that awful girl I was with?  Can I kiss this outside my airplane hanger and have a picture taken? 
[02:48:30]  Oops.  Another gentleman?  Smooch-a-roo.  Smooch-a-roo.  T-sk-t-sk-u.  T-hee-hee.  T-hee-hee-hee.  Can I inject Ron Hubbard's sperm into my wife and make an evil baby?  Hey, Mr. Cotter.  Mr. Cotter.  Hey, let's say hi to Stuart in Canada who just has nonsense.  You got nonsense for the show.  All right, Stuart.  Stuart, you're on.  Go.  Let her rip.  Go.  Right on, buddy.  Yeah, no, I just wanted to phone talk about the 911 thing because I've been looking into 
[02:49:00]  it for a long time.  I tell you, a lot of people are sure down on what they're not up on because if you looked  into all the witnesses that day.  All right, hold on.  Did you just say that people are down on what they're not up on?  Yeah, he's got like a whole rap.  Let him get to his point.  Yeah, go ahead with the lingo.  I like it.  Let's get to the fucking point.  The point is, the planes that hit those buildings weren't even commercial airliners.  They were military aircraft.  Oh, totally.  There were no windows in them.  Right, right, right.  You could totally tell.  I read that, yeah.  Yep, no windows.  And what else? 
[02:49:30]  What else?  The security guards that were working in the building that day, as well as the firemen  that went in there, heard explosions in the basement even before the second plane hit.  Right.  Can I ask one question?  Hold on, hold on.  I have a question for Stuart because a lot of times I'm down on what I'm not up on.  I was watching a special where two parents were talking about the conversation they had  with their son, who was on the second plane.  Your son.  And he said that we're, he was describing what was happening. 
[02:50:00]  They were flying low.  He said to his parents, these two old people, I'm afraid we're going to hit some kind of  building or something like that.  And they said right before he died, as they're watching it on TV, he's going, oh my God,  oh my God, because he saw the building.  Yeah.  So how do you explain that or how do you explain the messages?  It's ridiculous that you need specific corroboration.  But I'm curious as to how he would explain that.  Oh, and you're right.  You know what?  That, that, that's, that's one of the main things that's bothered me is the fact where  did these, if these people weren't on the plane or they were on the plane, either, either 
[02:50:30]  they were taken off the plane before those buildings hit or they were put on that military  plane.  Yeah.  And they were told, yeah, they would take the passengers from some airplane and load  them onto a military plane.  That's what I would do.  I would just walk into a military plane in order to make the cell phone call, even though  that he can't see out of the window, because apparently he didn't have windows.  There weren't any windows.  Yeah.  They wouldn't even know because they'd be, you know, the regular airplane seat on a plane  or sitting in like a net, like a C-130.  That would, that would just be like, oh, this is a different plane.  Well, you know, there were windows.  There were windows.  I'm just telling you, there were windows. 
[02:51:00]  A friend who lived on Barrick Street, which is right there, looked out the window with  his dad, his old Greek father next to him, just to give you a little detail to make it  more authentic.  And they saw the second plane hit.  They watched it like curve and hit, and they saw an airline plane, and he saw what fucking  airline it was.  It's a passenger plane.  The whole thing, yeah.  My question is this.  Why do we have to live in a world with guys like this?  He's in Canada.  I don't mind.  That's true.  And, you know, another thing, you know, I mean, there's so much that they're not telling  you anyways. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, why do you think they're telling you?  What about it?  Flight 93 that never even hit the fucking ground.  Flight 93 was, was, was, uh.  It didn't ever hit the ground.  It's still hovering two inches above the ground.  If you go, they're so low on fuel.  It's actually a tourist site.  Where are those people, Stuart?  And, hey.  Where are those people, Stuart?  I'll tell you where they are.  I'll tell you where they are.  The government uses them in mind control experiments and fucks around with them.  That's what they do.  Totally.  All right.  Our government does that.  Your government does that.  Finally.  Our government does that, but, you know, Canada. 
[02:52:00]  You guys just sit around making.  Yeah, Canada's just bad.  They're all run by the same fucking big wig.  You just up there making round bacon and jacking each other off.  Yeah.  Hold on.  If you guys seen the video footage of the Pentagon.  Let me ask you a question.  The pole that hit the Pentagon wasn't even big enough for a plane to hit.  Oh, yeah.  I love this story, too.  Stuart, can I ask Stuart, though?  Because he might be onto something.  What about the messages that people got?  Like, the messages people got, like, from people on the planes and stuff.  How do you explain?  Was that some kind of a voice control thing? 
[02:52:30]  Well, the messages that they got...  Or people who talked to their kids.  Because they didn't mention.  Like, the odd part, you might be right about being loaded onto a military plane, but he said  we were hijacked by Arabic men or whatever.  Or he didn't...  Like, why wouldn't he mention the loading onto the military plane?  By the way, there was a stopover at a military base.  Yeah.  Like, why wouldn't he mention that to his parents?  Like, why wouldn't he talking to his parents?  You're right.  You know, that's all...  Those are all the questions that I don't have myself.  You know what the answer is?  There's no questions that you don't have answers to. 
[02:53:00]  You have the answer.  What you're saying is bullshit.  And what happened was people didn't like.  I've looked into it.  Fucko.  And what happened was people that didn't like us flew planes into buildings and they collapsed  and killed people.  Your own fucking country doesn't like you.  They're a fucking fascist dictatorship.  Shut up.  You fucking would have been talking Russian motherfuckers if it wasn't for us.  You motherfucking Canadian cocksucker.  You would have been overrun by the commies if it wasn't for the US of A right there to 
[02:53:30]  your south.  You son of a bitch.  Keeping you safe, you pussy country.  What were you going to send over your goddamn Dudley Do-Right force?  To take care of the fucking Soviet menace, you cocksucker.  Go fuck yourself, you canuck.  What I love is that during all that you were looking up at his name on the computer.  I had to.  I was all angry with it.  He went directly.  I had to look at his name.  I just had to look at Canada.  He turned to look at the name.  I actually agree with Stuart as far as Flight 93 goes. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, do you?  I really believe the plane.  Still circling?  Huh?  Still.  Yeah.  No, it got stuck in the suck zone.  The suck zone.  Yeah.  No, really.  Never hit the ground.  Here's the problem with Stuart.  He is like a lot of them are.  Like the whiskey bottle.  He wants so much to be a part of figuring out something.  He wants so badly to stand out.  Dude, we've really looked at a lot of this stuff.  The reason this stuff mainly got brought up on the show is I was interested about the  Pentagon questions.  So I mentioned it and I got the answers from a number of different people and I actually 
[02:54:30]  believe the official story on it.  You're a little boy who doesn't want to believe what mommy and daddy have told him.  And a lot of times that's the right way to be.  Which is weird because it's, again, maybe Bush personally ordered 9-11 to happen.  But why say that he did it in this weird way with switching planes?  This twisted switching of planes.  Why if he's fucked up enough.  Mind experiments on people.  Yeah, if he's fucked up enough to use a military plane, why not pay terrorists that work for  his partner?  Bin Laden and Bush families are partners in a bunch of ventures. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Got his partner to send some terrorists over with the American Airlines plane.  Why not that instead of actually they landed in Virginia.  Put the passengers for some reason just to divert continuity.  Yeah, they said they landed somewhere like in Sweden or something.  Put the passengers on a military plane.  And they painted windows with little heads on the outside.  Waving faces.  As a mural on the side of a military jet.  Yeah.  And they made up the whole, like, the flight, the first flight that hit when she's like, 
[02:55:30]  our first has been stabbed.  All those calls from the flight attendants.  All fake.  All family know.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  With false scripted.  That's what I'm talking about.  Instead of just doing the obvious.  Little children.  Someone has been stabbed on the plane.  Yeah.  Cut.  Like, do they have to get an actor for that?  Is she a government employee that says, we need you to pretend you're on a 9-11 flight,  but don't tell anybody you did this job.  What, can I lift it on IMDB?  No.  No.  And you have to do a dead-on impression of that guy's wife. 
[02:56:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  We have voice technology.  Yeah.  And you have to know everything about her just because a question comes up.  So much work.  What the fuck kind of sci-fi is it?  So much work.  It's the easiest answer, people, which is people didn't like us and flew planes into  our buildings.  That's all.  That's all.  There's no fucking grand conspiracy.  We've tried to give 9-11 conspirators plenty of airtime.  And we do yell at them.  But there's been plenty of times where discussions.  No, the last time we didn't yell at them, you guys were really. 
[02:56:30]  You showed a lot of patience, actually.  I can't be bothered by myself.  Because they're always going to lose.  And you let them talk in circles and just babble.  Well, when they say things like you're the gatekeeper, like you realize this is what I'm  dealing with.  You're just a fucking teenager who wants so bad, man, to disprove what the dummies believe.  You know, you could sit there and believe the official story from the man-man and read  fucking about the JFK assassination, too, stupid. 
[02:57:00]  Black dog man.  In reality, it would have been two feet tall.  Do you understand?  I want to believe in that one, though.  I'm really starting to believe.  I mean, believe me.  I know a lot about the conspiracy.  I'm really starting to believe that it was Oswald.  I want to believe in that one.  It was Oswald.  They actually had a whole thing on HBO.  It was Oswald.  All horrible balls?  It was Oswald.  They have a whole thing on HBO where the forensic guy goes back and he's like, look, it was  one guy, all these shots from one.  Was it the people that were made out of gelatin and they put him in the car? 
[02:57:30]  I saw that one.  That was pretty cool.  It was almost like a myth buster.  It's not two gay guys from San Francisco.  Let's figure this out.  Do you have any gelatin?  Canada wants to defend itself, by the way.  We got Travis in Canada.  Travis.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hello.  Because we do like some of you Canadians.  Just some.  But admit that you would be part of the Soviet Union.  You're saving money on an army because we have one.  Right.  Exactly.  That's the thing.  Leave Travis.  Leave Travis alone.  That's where their free fucking health care comes from. 
[02:58:00]  The fact that they don't have to pump money into a goddamn army.  Because we do.  They got ours.  What, are we going to let a country invade our neighbor to the north?  Travis, it's not that we like you, Canada.  It's national defense.  It's true.  Travis is apologizing, basically, for that Stewart guy.  Fuck Travis.  Travis.  What's up, Travis?  Oh, no.  My shit.  You know, as a fellow, I want to say that that guy's a fucking idiot, man.  I mean, as for our army, I agree.  You know, we got a couple of dories out there with guys sitting in them with .22s, right? 
[02:58:30]  Shooting at the enemy, you know.  It's kind of a joke.  But, you know, I don't get where these people get off saying this kind of shit.  Like, I wish I had more free time to think up all these things about UFOs and all these conspiracies.  Because it really is a joker.  Yes, according to Michio Kaku, UFOs are certainly possible.  And, unfortunately, we can't get him on the show because he's on Good Morning.  UFOs, though.  I mean, all the UFOs. 
[02:59:00]  Some UFO sightings could be real.  Like, the actual account.  All UFO sightings are real.  It's just an unidentified flying object.  But, I mean, like the actual.  You mean flying saucers.  Well, the ones with lights.  The ones with lights.  The ones that have, like, headlights.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, how do you get a light bulb?  The ones that have general electric halogen lamps.  It's like, you can actually fly around without being detected by anything.  But you can't see.  But when you get out.  Dude, turn the lights on.  Hit the switch.  You need the lights that go around the thing. 
[02:59:30]  Isn't it remarkable?  Yeah, like all the weird science fiction movies just nailed it.  They're actually saucers.  They're actually saucers.  No, I believe that there's other.  I'm sure there's life on other planets.  But nobody in Texas or anywhere in America ever saw a fucking flying saucer.  We don't know that.  We don't know that.  If we are on the S end, because according to Dr. Cocker, there are many different universes.  Well, by the way, he's lactose intolerant.  Yes, he is.  Let's not forget.  He's a brilliant man, but he has awful milk farts. 
[03:00:00]  Ew.  He has talked about string theory and how there's many different universes.  Yes.  And how there are probably whirlpools which connect them.  I agree with that, but no fucking idiot in Texas saw a fucking UFO.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Maybe they like to go to Texas because they enjoy the food, Lou.  Sure.  Maybe they enjoy the fribs.  Like a little Tex-Mex.  Like a little barbecue.  That's right.  They don't like black people and they enjoy barbecue.  What better place to go?  The only place you can get barbecue and avoid the Negroes is Texas.  It's all of Texas.  Squeezing my cock right now. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, why?  You're always squeezing your cock.  Why, Jimmy?  He's just pinching the head of it, too, like it's a friend.  Mm-hmm.  Tigers.  Like a little kid.  I can come without touching my dick.  What?  Hold on.  Are you guys message board guys?  Hi.  There's three guys at the end of the bench as if they're making room for a bunch of hot  babes that are going to show up.  Exactly.  There's a bunch of fucking blowjobs on their way.  The one guy in the front looks like he just killed some girl.  Hold on, man.  Tom in New Hampshire brings up a very good point.  Tom.  Hey, Bobby.  I just wanted to ask you if you think that there are any werewolves involved in 9-11. 
[03:01:00]  But, uh, punch it out, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bob, once again, the werewolf thing.  You really creep everybody out.  You've heard this, right, Louie?  No.  Bobby swears when he was in Iraq doing his duty for this country.  Yeah.  Telling dick jokes.  Mm-hmm.  He saw an actual werewolf.  I won't deny the dick joke part.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I don't know if...  Look, let's put it this way.  It wasn't a dog. 
[03:01:30]  It wasn't...  And I...  When you...  I turned to a marine, okay, who didn't smile the whole time we were over there.  Yeah.  Okay, he was just there to protect us.  I go, what was that?  He goes, I don't know.  What, like you saw a person?  A hairy person?  No, it was like a wolf with a man chest.  And like a man torso.  And it was like higher off the ground.  It's like an Arab gentleman.  It was actually...  Don't you understand?  They look like that.  It was just...  Arab gentleman. 
[03:02:00]  Gentleman.  Just a thin, barrel-chested Arab gentleman.  Could it have been something else there, Bob?  Why werewolf?  Well, because a werewolf looks like, you know, it's half man, half wolf.  Could it just be a wolf?  No.  It had the were in it.  It had to have a were.  Are you sure it's not W-H-E-R-E?  Maybe someone was looking for a wolf.  Werewolf.  Jesus.  All right, well.  Maybe it was just a deformed Iraqi baby. 
[03:02:30]  It was something like that.  Probably just some hairy savage.  I mean, what if they did crossbreed some...  It was in the palace, like Uday's palace.  But they had animals.  Didn't they have their own zoo or something?  They had a zoo, yeah.  They probably saw a monkey.  But this is the thing, is that when they, when the Americans got there, as soon as Uday  knew that, you know, they were coming and they were going to take over the palace, he  let all the animals out.  Like, all, everything.  Right.  And they actually told us when we got there, be careful of lions, because there's a few 
[03:03:00]  lions running around the compound.  We haven't caught them yet.  Yeah.  Like, they went around just shooting all the animals, like the ostriches and the giraffes.  They just killed everybody.  Get those ostriches.  They are very dangerous.  I hope there was a neck shot.  They have a...  I know.  I have to go with that.  The thing would just tip over his head.  His neck just bent in half, and he was looking at his own asshole for an hour and a half.  As he bled out.  He just felt silly.  This is embarrassing.  What is this?  Let's go to Rick in the Bronx. 
[03:03:30]  Rick.  Roman, Canadians are a bunch of freeloading.  He doesn't like Canada.  I think he likes Canada.  And, of course, all the people saying they physically saw the plane hit.  Yes.  We don't need your calls today.  We're right there with you.  Of course.  How else do you see it with your fucking mind?  Theoretically saw it?  Fuck you right in the mouth.  Let's go to Jared in New Hampshire.  Jared.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Love you.  Love the show. 
[03:04:00]  Linger longer.  About the UFOs, man.  I think they're not aliens.  Man, I'm thinking that people from the future are coming back to check in on that.  Ah, right.  And wait a minute.  Get the sports book.  Wait a minute.  If they're coming back to the future, maybe they could have planted explosives inside the  World Trade Center.  And maybe they could have taken people and put them on fucking time machines.  Oh, my God.  This is the story of Biff Tannen.  Sir, you mock it. 
[03:04:30]  Einstein did not believe time travel was possible.  However, they've theorized.  I think Einstein did say that if the universe was round, somehow circular, and you could travel  around it, you would come back technically before you had left.  So, time travel is possible.  Yeah, but he was a Jew with messy hair.  Can you do me a favor?  Can I just say something?  Listen to him.  Fucking Jew without a comb.  Shut the fuck up.  If time travel was possible, I'd go back around 10 minutes ago before Norton called me 
[03:05:00]  over to look.  Gave himself an erection?  Yeah, he gave himself an erection and then moved it without touching it.  But he's moving it in his pants without touching it.  It's got the twitch.  Yeah, it's nervous.  It's the Michael J. Hart on.  Is a little leftover cialis in your system there, Jimmy?  A lot of it.  A lot of it?  Oh, boy.  No, I'm just having a good day.  I feel good.  It feels good to be all just...  It feels good just to have what I call a juicy mouthful.  Anybody want a juicy mouthful?  No. 
[03:05:30]  You can see the shape of the helmet through his jeans.  Just shift it to the loose side.  If you look hard enough, I stop looking.  I'm not even hard.  It's even hard.  Yeah, but I'm saying like, watch, watch, watch.  Let me flex it.  Why are you doing that?  It actually has more muscle than his arm.  Oh, God.  I bet your dick can curl more than your arm.  Bob.  Hold on.  Same joke twice Friday.  You know what?  It was very Voss-like, wasn't it?  Arm.  I should have spit when I said it.  Bob, Puddle of AIDS came up with a great idea for us today. 
[03:06:00]  We're trying to show you something.  What?  You can't find the long one right now.  No, that's a shitty one.  A long one.  All right, hold on.  Not that one.  You know the one.  I'm looking.  Let me get the link.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  Keep talking.  Man.  Bing, bong, bing, bong, bing, bong, bing.  I'm making it up.  I'm making it up on.  Oh, no, that one.  It's got to be that one.  It's not talking, Bobby.  Bing, bong, bing, bong, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  Uh, you're going to be on tonight? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I'm on Call of Duty 4.  Oh, yeah.  The new Klan sign is you hold your wrist limply.  Yeah.  And 4 Life.  Hold up the L4 Life.  I have to be honest with you.  Yeah.  I've removed the gay from my noodles name.  But you haven't removed it from your soul.  Or your life.  Or your asshole.  Take it out of your asshole, kid.  I was just getting too pissed off trying to get into games and having people boot me out  because I got gay in front of my name. 
[03:07:00]  It was a very homophobic group of people.  I'd sit there and go, join game, join game.  And it'd be like, oh, gay in the room.  Boom.  And I'm booted out.  Exactly.  That's why you stick with the gays.  You stay with us.  Then I sit there and try to fucking get into a game.  And I spend a half hour trying to fucking get into a game.  Can you change your name after you're in?  No, I've just removed the gay from the beginning of my name.  You should put the gay back in.  Because the fun still is them getting beat by a gay guy.  No, I'd rather just put the N word.  Something like that. 
[03:07:30]  I like gay Anthony.  I think it's hilarious.  And you should go, oh, go on, guys.  And be like over the top of me.  Well, we do.  We take that.  It's fun.  Let me tell you something.  It's fun when you're in the big group.  And we win.  When we have a team and it's just all and every name has gay in front of it.  And you sit there and they team you up with a bunch of other guys.  And you're going, hi, fellas.  Good job.  They get so mad.  They get all mad.  It's like, I'm not playing with a bunch of faggots.  They really are just racist.  And the black guys are the worst. 
[03:08:00]  Yo, motherfucker.  Fuck you, faggots.  And then we beat them.  And then right at the end, we all make sounds like we're sucking cock.  We're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's so weird.  But there's this whole world of fucking conflict going on.  There's a bunch of fucking people sitting in chairs getting all clammy.  What is the most sexist, homophobic, racist environment I've ever been in in my life is playing Call of Duty 4 live online.  It's worse than CB radio. 
[03:08:30]  You will hear fucking just like the N-words being thrown around at every turn.  Yeah.  Little kids.  That's like not even what's wrong with it.  It's just such a huge way.  People are just sitting in chairs.  It's not wasting time.  Oh, it's extremely fun.  Anthony, if you don't want to hear the N-word, just shut your mic off.  Yeah, well, plug your own ears.  Little kids that are on there are just like potty mouth.  Yeah.  Oh, go fuck your mother's cunt, you fucking. 
[03:09:00]  And they're like, it's this little kid voice.  I'm like, does your mother know you're fucking even talking like that?  But then you hear them.  Fuck her.  But then you hear them hacking the universe.  Dude, I went on the line last night and I got into the GSP9 server.  And, you know, those guys are real.  It's like, dude, what the fuck are you talking about?  Little geniuses.  Bob, you're talking about kids.  We got something for Bob.  Where's Sam?  What's that?  Oh, we got it.  Get over.  What is it?  Danny, get over there.  Oh, is this a fucking puking thing? 
[03:09:30]  Are you going to make me puke again?  Jesus Christ.  Jesus, what's wrong with you?  No, it's a scary channel.  Why would we continue doing the same bit over and over again?  I noticed that when Opie was just, you were making a hand signal to him to get the video  camera.  And he did like a movie camera with a crank.  Did you crank?  He cranked.  I went crank.  Oh, my God.  Get that old tin, loosey camera.  How else did you do it?  How else did you do it?  I know.  I know.  I don't know either.  I didn't know what to do.  No, so when you roll down.  I knew someone was going to call me out on that one.  It's like rolling down a window in a car.  You're ready to do the crank. 
[03:10:00]  You can just point to him.  Do we have audio for this guy, too?  Bah.  What happened to show prep?  What happened to show prep?  Do we have that disc where we have the audio?  Happened to.  That's assuming we had it.  Oh, God.  Can you guys come in like an hour early and just find some shit?  We do.  Football is like...  Okay.  Is that it?  What is it?  It's just a guy on Discovery Channel.  Ready?  Yes.  It's just audio or it's video?  No, it's good.  It's just somebody going to puke, right?  No, Bob.  Will you relax?  Is it the guy with the moles on his face? 
[03:10:30]  No, moles.  Moles.  What's wrong with you?  Can we just stop before you play it?  Opie, I want you to go home and...  Shut up, Bob.  You sing your sentences when you lie.  I hate that you got me.  Is that his tell?  Yeah, he goes, Bob, oh, no.  If you're telling me, we got every...  Bob is one of the only people to figure out my tell.  I hate you for that.  It's pretty good.  And I forgot you know that.  I got to face a monster.  Can we please put music behind Opie's lying?  No.  Honey, I didn't cheat on you. 
[03:11:00]  Bob, just check this out.  I never happened.  Bob, check this out.  Really.  It's all right.  Lisbon, Portugal.  So you know it's going to suck.  It's UFOs.  It's not a UFO, you jackass.  Yeah, you'll see.  They don't have Mestraya's waking up.  Oh, my God.  No, no big deal.  Yeah.  This don't...  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, this don't bug me.  That'll help.  That water will help.  So when I wake up, I wash my face.  And then I kill myself.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that don't bug me.  That's a tumor on his face.  Yeah, I can... 
[03:11:30]  I don't have a problem with this shit.  Oh, my God.  Then I cut a piece off of my face and I eat it.  Put it with my eggs.  I wonder if he actually combs his hair.  Because I stopped dribbling.  Why bother?  Did it look like he was cut a piece of his face off?  Look at his legs.  Sometimes the veins start to go.  Look at that lip.  Jose struggles with the simplest of day-to-day arms.  Is he going to rub cheese on it so it smells better?  It looks like a madam from Whelan.  Would you bite that?  Imagine biting that, though.  Jose has close-knit friends and family. 
[03:12:00]  I want to eat.  His sister, Gita, and her daughter, nine-year-old Rafaela.  She subjects her daughter to their food.  He's a normal.  He has a friend.  He's like football.  He's like talk with friends.  I think he's...  He is like a football.  Don't pick it.  Gita juggles running her hairdressers with cooking and cleaning.  I drink after breakfast, too.  Left bottle of wine on the table.  This whole family's got to be skinny.  How do you possibly eat around this? 
[03:12:30]  No way to eat.  It's a great diet.  I have an uncle with fucking diarrhea for a face.  Not a pound overweight, are you?  Diarrhea.  I really drink.  Is his mouth on the left side right there?  He doesn't even know.  I don't know.  He's just shoving it in stuff.  He's going to stick his head out the window and birds are going to land on it and shit on it.  Since he was a teenager, Jose has been losing his face to this life-threatening tumor.  What is it going to be life-threatening? 
[03:13:00]  It's still in the life-threatening stage.  That's amazing.  Get your head out of the window, you fucking selfish asshole.  Really?  There are people out there.  People walk by.  Human beings are outside.  You don't deserve fresh air.  It really does look like a beehive.  In the afternoon, Jose travels into Lisbon to pass time...  To horrify people.  To remind people what an asshole god is.  I get upset because the people, they come here, take a photo, don't say anything, and go. 
[03:13:30]  Is that right?  They think you're a creature.  Nice hat.  Oh, here's the hat.  But he puts the hat out for a dime.  I want to be able to talk to my friends, talk to everyone, and be able to cure my eyes.  I want to travel, to see what I've not seen.  Travel back to your home planet.  Like red lumpy shit in front of your eyes.  That's horrible. 
[03:14:00]  Jose's had enough.  He leaves the square with his nephew, Diogo.  What did he think?  Another victim.  He walks in front of him like they're not together.  I don't understand if you had a large wall on your face, but Jesus, dude.  No, he's a monster in a sweater.  Right.  I like how it bounces, though.  Look at him.  What was he going to hit?  I wouldn't hit anyone if I was you.  Yeah, it's very jiggly.  Don't use your fist. 
[03:14:30]  Use your tumor.  Upset by the day's events, Jose becomes angry and frustrated.  You don't want anyone punching in the face.  That whole thing is going to just explode.  He's trying to prove he's not as invisible.  Squish it with your feet and make wine out if it comes back.  He feels that people see only his condition and not the man behind the face.  Well, then stay home.  Jesus Christ.  Just put a fucking Nixon mask over it.  Don't bother people. 
[03:15:00]  Don't get mad at people for noticing that you're fucking horrid.  Jesus.  Is he holding it?  Oh, he's got to touch it all the time.  Do you think he's got a food pocket?  He's a brain face.  He looks smart.  He's really smart.  Hey, could you calculate some mathematics for me?  His face looks like kid cereal.  Cranberry tumor crunch. 
[03:15:30]  It's like a bag of potatoes that I forgot about for six months.  Potato eye face.  He's got just a piece of cauliflower up top.  Oh, he's awful.  His face looks healthy.  That's his nose.  That's his nose way down there.  You guys see this video.  I think it's a very important consultation.  No face, I think.  Because it can define the rest of his life.  Yeah.  Be great if the doctor walked in with a fucking...  Get a domino doctor to save his life.  And give Jose back his face. 
[03:16:00]  You might have won the game, but you lose in life.  You might have won the dominoes game.  He's playing the dominoes.  That's just fucking brutal.  I won.  Yeah, but look at your face.  But life hates you.  Did you?  Did you really win?  The domino effect is this.  They should push his mother into drinking during pregnancy, and she tumbles into him and the  rest of his life.  That's it.  That's it.  Guys, it's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  Get a brain face.  It's weird.  This kind of thing always happens to some fucking dude in an ugly sweater in Lisbon. 
[03:16:30]  Why doesn't it happen to the president?  Imagine if the president got a mole, and then it just became this fucking shit face.  And he was such a great president, you gotta keep him in there.  Yeah, and you're like, oh, and he's got a...  Oh, man, the president's face is fucking...  He actually has a...  Turning into elephant shit.  A nose holder?  Jesus.  Why don't we take a presidential nose holder?  Yes.  Come here, come here.  Hang on.  Oh, what I was trying to say. 
[03:17:00]  Why don't we take our first break here at XM?  That's right.  We got Louis C.K. playing Cleveland and Buffalo and elsewhere.  I beat it.  Right?  That's right.  February 14th, Buffalo.  That's Valentine's Day, though.  Yeah, that's right.  Cleveland, I don't care.  Special Valentine's Day show?  Yeah, sure, go ahead and say that.  Okay.  That's fine.  It's a special Valentine's Day show where I'll be mentioning everything but Valentine's  Day as a tribute.  And you can call...  February 14th in Buffalo.  Oops, sorry.  You can call...  I'm sorry.  You can call the Maxwell Show in Cleveland, 800-348-1007. 
[03:17:30]  Just don't curse on the air, because that will wreck their show.  Yes, just remind them that I'm going to be there on the 15th.  That's right.  Sure.  At the Playhouse.  And I'll be there on the 29th in the House of Blues.  Both shows are sold out.  Don't say cunt.  You get two shows sold out already.  Of course.  That's great, dude.  It's been sold out.  Good for you.  I'm fucking Cleveland Jimmy.  You're at the improv, Bob?  Ah, yeah.  I'm at the improv.  All right.  We're going to take a break and continue with the show.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What does this mean?  By the way, can I correct Bob real quick?  On your...  That doesn't sound like cock sucking.  No.  No, you got to do it like this.  Like this.  Like this.  Like this.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  You don't...  Make this noise.  And then, so are you going to call me later?  Call you. 
[03:18:30]  Damn it.  This sucks.  I hate that.  Okay.  No more fucking each other.  Well, what about the end?  I told you.  What about the end?  What?  What happens at the end?  Wait, no.  Okay.  Oh, praise.  See, I'm going to hear that next time a woman's blown me in 2048.  Just think of a little baby face with small little lumpy ears.  I'm going to go record a promo.  Come fuck me for it. 
[03:19:00]  Come on.  For real.  We got to figure out what this means, and we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about slut.  Skank hoes.  Skank hoes.  Dirty pussy turkey meatloaf.  Pussy hair and sparkle shit on the tip of her head.  How about a pulpy tampon with some sausage links next to it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. </pre>
