<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a lengthy and highly profane rant focused on a malfunctioning microphone stand for Opie.  The new stand was poorly installed, forcing Opie to lean uncomfortably close to the microphone to be heard.  The hosts, using a tape measure, demonstrated the excessive distance between Opie's mouth and the microphone, leading to a barrage of insults directed at the technical crew, specifically Mars and Jake, for their incompetence in both selecting and installing the substandard equipment.  The conversation was peppered with crude jokes, sexual references, and descriptions of bodily functions, all while criticizing the stand's poor quality and appearance compared to previously considered options.  The hosts also lamented the state of Opie's studio, noting its previous use and subsequent damage by another show, and compared their lack of a video component unfavorably to other radio programs.  The segment concluded with a discussion about obtaining better equipment and the potential alternative of broadcasting from Anthony's basement.  No guests were present in the studio during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I don't know how to do it. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  It's been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what you're talking about.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this. 
[00:04:00]  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day.  Every day.  That's what I say.  Are you guys having a good time or what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make a fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch. 
[00:05:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, everybody.  Morning.  Into the mic.  Morning.  How's everybody?  Good.  I'm good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I can't hear you.  Mic's a little low and distant sounding.  What is that?  Holy shit.  You're sitting like you sit every day.  You haven't changed positions. 
[00:05:30]  Why don't you pull the mic up to your face a little?  Oh.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  I gotta join you guys on the radio show today.  I gotta be...  What?  A foot to 18 inches away from the microphone.  Because of this brilliant company.  Listen, just when we settle in and accept whatever shit has swept over us in the past.  Yeah.  Some new shit.  The tide brings in some brand new shit.  All right.  I will lean all the way over so I can broadcast. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, there you go.  For a second.  Because this is going to hurt my back.  So that's how you're going to have to broadcast all day.  I'm leaning way the fuck over.  I've never seen anything like that.  What?  Incompetence?  Just, it's so short.  It's like Highwaters.  If you had fucking pants, that'd be Highwaters.  I said to Anthony and Jim, I'm like, here we go.  We gotta bitch again.  And I know there's a lot of listeners that fucking, they've had it.  But they make it so easy on a daily basis.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  I'm leaning way the fuck over.  This is the only way I can broadcast, okay?  Like, this is how I usually broadcast.  Yeah, you pull the mic up right to your face.  I can't move my microphone.  So you gotta put now your face up to the mic, instead of pulling the mic to your face, and  you're hunched over the console.  You know how I've talked in the past about how I rest my ball bag on the sink to shave  and brush my teeth?  That's what I'm going to have to do to broadcast today.  Yeah.  Because I'm leaning all the way over.  I'm going to have to actually rest my balls on the console.  Now, a little history here. 
[00:07:00]  We've been looking into getting new mic stands.  I'm going to sit back so I can rest my back if you don't mind, okay?  Just sit back.  We've been looking at new mic stands, because these that we have are pretty intrusive when  we're trying to video or take pictures of stuff.  Right.  They're very tall.  They're all in the way.  They're very lanky, like robot arms all over the console.  So we wanted a lower profile one.  Things that are a little closer down to the console.  So they got one, and Opie is the test guinea pig today for this. 
[00:07:30]  I'm going to lean back into the mic so I can talk for a second.  Oh, okay.  So they came to us and said, somebody's got to try out the new mic stand.  I go, yeah, I'll try it.  Whatever.  Because like you said, we want to make sure if we're videotaping or taking pictures of  the celebrities, you can see their fucking faces.  Right.  If you check my Twitter and anyone else's Twitter around here, you always see the celebrity  with these.  It's intrusive.  There's all sorts of shit in front of their face, so we're trying to avoid that.  Yeah.  So I go, yeah, I'll try the fucking mic stand. 
[00:08:00]  So I come in today, and there's a brand new mic stand.  You can see my face perfectly, but I can't broadcast from where I usually sit, which is  right here.  It's not adjustable forward and back, like towards, or away from, oh, no.  I can't fucking pull it.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  They put it behind the board.  You fucking idiots.  On the other side of the board, instead of drilling a new hole that's closer, you can't 
[00:08:30]  even move closer.  I'm literally, I'm literally, what, 18 inches?  At least.  18.  Did I just lose my mic?  No.  I felt like, oh, somehow my volume went way down.  Well.  You might have dropped the mic on something.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, there we go.  Okay.  I'm 18 inches away from the microphone, and these idiots that work here think this is  acceptable.  It's just amazing.  There's no adjustment for it to go forward, like forward towards Opie.  No.  It's just a pivot, basically.  Yeah, it's a pivot.  And in order for Opie to broadcast the way that he needs to, he has to lean forward and 
[00:09:00]  put his, like, forearm on the console, so, like, he's the most interesting man in the  world.  And we all know I'm not.  Hey, he admitted it.  Oh, shit.  But I, yeah, I'll throw on my back if I broadcast like that.  Oh, God.  I don't always do a radio show.  It's almost, it's also like, remember how Edward R. Murrow used to broadcast? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  He was kind of sideways, leaning on his console, smoking a cigarette.  You'd actually have to cut, you'd have to cut a piece out like fucking Henry VIII.  Yes.  And move a foot and a half closer to that mic to broadcast comfortably.  Yeah.  But, you know, that's exactly it.  This is what people accept around here, because they're, this whole place is run by a bunch  of dummies.  Larry King pose, right.  Exactly.  Now you're getting it.  That's exactly what he has to do.  That's right.  I just got into my studio.  My studio is trashed.  What?  Trashed.  Everything's unplugged. 
[00:10:00]  There's drinks everywhere.  What?  Who was in your studio?  And I just called engineering.  They're like, oh, yeah, they're doing a new show out of there now.  What?  What?  Why are they doing a show out of there?  So I would assume that has something to do with this.  I don't know.  There's a hundred studios around here.  I don't know.  What show are they doing out of the Opie and Anthony production studio?  A production studio?  A sports show now will be done out of there.  No, no, it's not going to be done out of there.  Where's the radio wizard today?  What do they mean?  They don't have any answers for me.  And what is it?  They just trash it and then fucking walk out?  They just left.  Do you have a picture of it?  Let's... 
[00:10:30]  No, I started putting it together.  Oh.  Why are cables out?  I'm going to do the show like this.  I can't hear you.  I know.  No one can really hear you very well, Opie.  What's the matter?  I can hear myself.  What happened?  I can't lean in like this for four hours.  Every time you lean in, I'm sorry, it's hilarious.  It's so ridiculous.  I can't do it.  This is the dumbest thing.  Well, add it to the list of the dumb things that happens all the time.  The lights, the coat rack, all the fun things that have happened in this studio. 
[00:11:00]  The fucking, the banner with our name in it that blocked the view of everything.  Remember all these fun things?  And they wonder, they're like, wow, I don't understand how Liberty Media could just swoop  in and take over this place.  Really strange.  Is it?  With all the incompetence?  So far away.  They're like Bane Capital.  I can't lean in.  They would sell off that mic stand in a second.  You could fit Shaq's shoe in between that mic and your mouth. 
[00:11:30]  It'd actually make better radio in front of his face than that microphone.  That is fucking terrible.  That's not even close.  It's not like it's off by six inches or four inches.  Yeah, where someone could say...  It's a good two feet off.  Dude!  Where someone could say you're a picky Pete or whatever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is like, it's not even close.  Like Ant's console part goes in.  Like I said, the Henry VIII, he's carved on a half moon crest.  So he can move...  You can't even move in over there.  If this was football, you wouldn't bring out the chain.  No, you wouldn't even need the chain. 
[00:12:00]  Not at all.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's fourth and over a yard.  Oh, shit.  God.  Oh, my good gracious.  Is the Radio Wizard aware of this, Sam?  No, not yet.  Radio Wizard.  How about we wake up the Radio Wizard and tell him about the latest stupid problem?  What the fuck is this?  Because you've got to blame the main guy.  He'll blame...  Who will he blame?  I need more ice than this.  That a boy, Anthony.  I need a cup full of ice.  Yes, you do.  Full cup.  Absolutely. 
[00:12:30]  Soak those big juicy balls in.  No, what about Mars, though?  Because he said that he's the one that did it, so they're going to try to kill Mars.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Let's go to...  So the Radio Wizard, who I blame because he supposedly, you know, oversees the channel.  Who will he blame this time?  Yeah, I believe...  Someone upstairs?  Yeah, because...  Will it be some vague thing where he points at the ceiling tiles?  Why wouldn't he supervise this whole thing and make sure it was right?  I believe Mars will indeed take the blame.  Wow.  Not take it, or receive it, I should say. 
[00:13:00]  Now, Mars...  He will be blamed.  You didn't build this mic stand, did you?  No, I did not.  No, you got it, and we're told to install it.  That's correct.  By the way, I've been doing radio since I was 18.  I don't really want to tell everyone how old I am.  This is the worst piece of equipment I've ever seen.  It looks like a piece of shit.  It's shoddy.  When was the last time you saw something with washers?  There's giant washers.  The bolt is the size of Frankenstein's neck bolt.  Kenny, let me compare.  It's horrible. 
[00:13:30]  You're going to hurt your back, G.H.  How cheap is this thing?  It's pretty cheap.  It also looks like it's been repaired because of those washers.  I don't understand why all those washers are there.  There's a giant weld on it.  I would say, I would use a politically incorrect term for what that looks like, but instead I'll  just call it the...  It looks like it's been a presidential solution.  That's what I say.  It's a solution.  It's a solution.  Yes, yes.  So, Mars, why did they order that one? 
[00:14:00]  Why did you recommend that one?  Jimmy, hold up.  Slow your roll.  Slow your roll.  I'm leaning in again for a second.  I did not recommend that one.  Mars, you're going to get in trouble for this.  Am I really?  Oh, yeah, because the stupid radio wizard doesn't take blame for anything.  So he's going to have to blame somebody.  I have proof that I emailed another mic boom that should have been purchased, but they went  with this one instead.  So they can't do basic math? 
[00:14:30]  Mr. Wizard.  I think this mic boom is a lot cheaper than the one that we recommended.  But they can't do basic math?  Like, how far is that away, and how far is this?  That's like basic math.  And with no adjustment.  Like, shouldn't that have an adjustment?  Even if I were to drill a hole and put it on the other side, you still would need it to extend that way.  Get me a tape measure.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah?  Yes.  Yes.  We're going to do some tape measuring here on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to do basic construction. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  That is...  Like, why wouldn't you go...  Why wouldn't you have an adjustment in and out?  It needs that adjustment.  I've tried every time.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my Jesus.  That's very frustrating.  Oh, there you go.  I adjusted a little bit, but then the wires are...  Adjust?  No, you pulled the...  You ripped the whole thing out.  You pulled out the pivot.  Yeah, that's not an adjustment.  That's not adjusted.  It's broken.  Yes.  That's like saying, Jake adjusted Vicky's jaw.  Oswald adjusted Kennedy's hair.  Yeah, he recalmed his hair. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, fuck.  I need a clock today.  Uh-oh.  There we go.  Yeah, we're a professional show.  It's like he rocks Legos.  All right.  Now...  Snapping it together.  Now, look.  Safe to say this is where I sit, right?  Yeah.  Dead center.  And your chair is up pretty high.  Okay, so...  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's see from the pivot point.  Yeah, where this thing would go into the console.  To where I'm sitting.  To where you're really sitting.  I'm going to call it just over three feet.  I think it's further.  You've got to go up to your mouth when you're sitting back. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Oh, you're right.  Oh, shit.  You know this.  And you're leaning forward a little bit now.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I would be about here.  Call it 39 inches.  Okay.  Yes.  That's three feet, three inches.  The, uh...  What is this called?  An arm?  Mic boom.  I don't know.  A mic boom.  That isn't even a mic boom.  No, it's not.  That looks like someone's fucking, like, a goddamn bunch of metal.  Front end suspension out of a fucking beetle.  That's like the arm of that ice cream man.  You know the ice cream man who would come away?  He's had the fucking stub arm.  And that rotten little hand, which was good for waving away flies. 
[00:16:30]  It's as stretched as far as it's going to go.  I guess so.  It looks like a ratchet set.  It's terrible.  With too many knuckles on it.  Too many knuckles.  It's very hard to use.  A lot of knuckles.  30 inches.  We're off by nine...  Wait, 30 inches.  And I said 30...  Yeah, we're...  My cock.  We're off by my cock.  We're off by nine inches.  I think further.  It seems further, though.  Yeah, yeah.  At least nine inches.  Yeah, because you were still leaning forward when you were measuring.  I noticed you weren't in broadcast position. 
[00:17:00]  I said, what do we do?  You've got to lean back where you are, right there.  You normally just sit back and talk.  That's where you are.  You're right there.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Now you've got to bring it right up to your mouth.  And add...  Right there.  And you're measuring it from the top of the thing, not the console.  42.  Yeah, you're right.  Sweetie baby is grabbing it.  Yeah, thank you.  You're further.  Put it down to the bottom, too, on the console.  To be fair, because they're going to...  No, yeah.  All right, 40.  Yeah, you're right.  44 inches.  You're like 44 inches away.  And how far is this again? 
[00:17:30]  33?  33.  Yeah, that makes more sense.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's not good to have that there.  So you ordered a different one, Marge?  You didn't want that one?  Dude, look at this.  They're trying to save money wherever they can.  It's on the computer.  That's the one that I recommended.  But actually, E-Rock sent it to me, and I sent it to my boy.  Oh, that's the one...  That's the one they showed me. 
[00:18:00]  That's the one Marge showed.  Yes, we'll try those.  Yes.  So why did we get to this one?  Look at that thing.  It's the same thing.  Exactly.  Sure.  We're looking at a picture of the ideal mic stands that we were looking for.  Totally different.  And it comes from the bottom and stands up, which means the whole top of your face is better.  This is the no-frills version of that.  Remember growing up?  You couldn't get the Nikes, so you got the, what, the Nikes with two E's or something?  This is CVS Pharmacy brand.  Right.  No-frills.  You could tell you could extend that one.  See? 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  That's a pretty good mic on.  Ah, damn.  So, but why did the Radio Wizard go with these, even though I said yes to those?  That's beyond my knowledge.  Who looked at that and said, go with that?  Who's the one person that said, that'll work?  Anthony, I do not know the answer to that question.  Now, let me ask you.  You're on the air.  It apparently was not Gary.  Gary's not seen that yet.  All right.  So who is the person?  But Gary runs the channel, so why didn't he see this yet? 
[00:19:00]  Gary says he knows that it arrived, but he did not know that it was being installed yesterday,  and he was still waiting to see it before it was installed.  What, he just wrote you?  Yes.  Okay, so Gary hadn't seen it.  No.  So he, and now, two questions.  Is that one on order?  I still blame him.  I do not believe so.  Is that good one on order?  Of course not.  So who approved this one?  Who told you to put it in?  My boss, Jake.  Jake.  Jake.  Okay, so.  So who, but who, who ordered? 
[00:19:30]  Someone had a look at it and say, yep, that's the one.  Order that.  Who is the person?  Yeah, who, well, you're not going to get that answer around here.  Well, Jake, it might have been Jake.  Who looked at that picture of what we want?  Right.  And then saw that and said, yep, go with it.  I want to know who the name, I want to name who made the switch.  It's just basic measuring.  Right.  Obviously this doesn't work.  Not only does it not work.  It doesn't come with like.  It looks like a lump of shit.  Yeah, who made the switch?  Maybe it comes with accessories.  Jimmy, I, I don't know. 
[00:20:00]  You have fucking, a chiropractor.  I have a, I have an idea.  Well, who actually ordered it?  Who put it in the order?  Are you authorized to put through the order?  No, I'm not.  Not.  Okay, so who put it in the order?  I believe Jake Glantz put the order in.  Okay, so Jake made the switch.  Why did Jake make the switch?  Why did Jake go from that mic, which we want, to that piece of shite?  I could only assume he was budgeting, you know, money.  Well, you get what you pay for.  I'll tell you that much.  Yep.  That is true.  I'd rather pay a little more for exactly what I want. 
[00:20:30]  See, I can't fucking outshot you.  I can't outshot you.  Oh, you can, oh, Jesus.  I can't even hear you.  I can't even hear it.  Let's all just lean back like this, away from our mics.  This is literally, in sympathy of Opie, we're all going to just do this show like this.  I'm not going to yell.  I'm just going to talk like I want to.  Let's just over-modulate all the mics.  Just push the pots open.  There you go.  I'm just going to, wow.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, that sounds good.  All right, we got a little room hum.  A little ambiance. 
[00:21:00]  A little room hum going on.  That's good.  Let's all have a lean.  Let's all have a lean.  Now it's just like we're on a podcast now.  Yes.  It's very podcast-y.  You know what, dude?  This is ridiculous.  Yeah.  I feel like a silly goose.  Yeah.  It really is retarded.  When you come back to professional broadcasting, you guys get to.  Yeah, we do.  Well, you can, too.  Yeah.  Can I?  Just lean in.  Lean in.  I hope he needs a masseuse to show.  Like he's been playing cards at the table a long time. 
[00:21:30]  He's one of those casino masseuses to massage his back while he leans over.  Every time you lean in, you look like, every time you talk, you look like you're about  to break the case wide open.  Very important statement coming up.  Oh, fuck.  No surprise, right?  Well, yeah.  But this one may have another person to blame.  This is not Gary.  I mean, this is, really, he always skates.  Well, did he tell Jake, because he's the budget master, did he say? 
[00:22:00]  Did Gary say, go and get the ones that the guy said, yeah, they look good?  I don't know the answer to that.  There's so many people involved in this now.  It's always the way they cover their asses.  That's why we go through this exercise.  Right.  Because, you know, people out there can relate.  I want them to know.  No responsibility ever unless it's the working douchebag like we are.  And I want them to know that they're not pulling one over on us.  They're not pulling one over on us.  That's why we reiterate this and try to find the responsible party.  This thing is horrible. 
[00:22:30]  It's so bad.  That big bolt is annoying me.  Yeah.  Look at the, there's, how many watches are on there?  It's like an Usain bolt or something.  Good one.  When you do life in the compound, I would assume you have something a little nicer in it.  It's so much nicer.  And it didn't, like, break your budget.  No.  You look and go, this is what I needed.  And you get it.  Why are they trying to save $5?  Oh, God.  We should just broadcast from Anthony's basement.  We really should.  Goes for a dip after.  How handy would that commute be?  Bedroom, basement. 
[00:23:00]  I've actually tried out a few different mics at my house and found the ones that work best for television.  That, those aren't them.  We have a green screen.  Wow, that's early on.  How about the, oh, my God.  That's early on.  Now I have good ones.  Ah.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Ah, that was a co-host days.  Ha, ha, co-hostess days.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  By the way, the new one is up on iTunes.  By the way, the one where I cover the Democratic National Convention.  Bill Clinton's speech. 
[00:23:30]  So, please tune in.  It's on iTunes.  Just search out compound.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  It's very funny when Obama talks, I have a bouncing communist flag behind him.  Oh, dear.  That's very funny.  That's great.  And you should see what happens when Bill talks.  So, that's a visual?  Lewinsky comes into the picture.  How fun is that?  That's the video.  Oh, the visual element.  That's great.  Green screen.  It is a lot of fucking fun, man.  That's awesome, man.  It's a lot of fun.  Why is it?  Because Jimmy was texting me over the weekend. 
[00:24:00]  Why does Nick and Artie already have a visual element?  They've been doing radio three months.  Yeah.  We've been at this 18 years.  We can't get a visual element.  They have an amazing studio, man.  Why can't we do that?  We have a visual elephant.  He rocks.  We barely have an audio element today.  That's true.  We're looking for visual element.  No one can hear Opie.  I talked to Bob about this.  I'm like, you know, we can't have every hour of our show broadcast like Nick and Artie do. 
[00:24:30]  Because they're on terrestrial radio.  This is subscription.  It's a different thing.  Well, they're on Sirius XM, too.  Yes, they are.  Proving that you can work all the moving parts.  And Anthony has proven that from doing live from the compound, you can do some fun things.  Yeah.  Dude, that studio is awesome.  Even if you just offered, I don't know, a best of video fucking podcast.  I agree.  We film everything for a week.  Then you put maybe a couple hours up every week.  I agree.  I agree.  They want us to...  Well, it doesn't like when I get into this, but I can't wait. 
[00:25:00]  They just want us to stay here.  It's like, well, you know, how about you do some things and then we'll talk.  Some things.  I walked in and I said, I want my money doubled.  Oh, nice.  No one was in the room.  Scott was out, but I just walked into his office and said, I'd like my money doubled.  I wanted to see what that felt like.  Double money.  Double bucks.  You know, it's a great joke, but I mean, your money should be doubled. 
[00:25:30]  This place is ridiculous.  Everyone's going, where's the picture?  Go to Jim Norton's Twitter.  I Twittered a picture of...  Jim Norton on Twitter.  Opie looking very sad.  Opie, at least it doesn't squeak when you move it.  I'm not squeaking.  You wouldn't hear it anyway.  It's too far away.  I'm not the squeaker anymore.  No.  There, a question has been answered.  I'm squeaky guy.  I haven't been the squeaky guy for a while.  I like squeaky guy. </pre>
