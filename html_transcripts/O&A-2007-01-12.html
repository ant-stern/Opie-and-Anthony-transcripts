<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with crude jokes about pornography, featuring Bobby Kelly filling in for Jim Norton, who was at the AVN Awards.  The hosts recounted Norton's past escapades at the awards, including a rotisserie incident involving Ron Jeremy.  Kelly then detailed his early-morning viewing of an escort channel on Manhattan Cable, leading to a sexually charged discussion about escorts and offensive stereotypes about Asian women.  This transitioned into a story about a poker game in Vegas where a drunk man offended Asian players, further fueling racially charged jokes.  A listener call shifted the conversation to sports, specifically the New England Patriots, and a caller shared a story about his father catching him watching pornography. Frequent caller Big T then reminisced about a suggestive 80s exercise show on Showtime, leading to a discussion about watching scrambled porn channels.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a phone interview with Donald Trump, who used highly offensive language while discussing his feud with Rosie O'Donnell and a legal battle over a large American flag.  The show then returned to discussing David Caruso's acting in *CSI*, specifically a humorous YouTube video montage of his exaggerated lines and exits.

The next segment began with a caller abruptly ending a call, followed by more profane banter and calls from Chuck (describing a bizarre video), Chris (with a knee injury), and Al (repeatedly admonished for cursing).  A lengthy game of finding David Caruso-esque movie lines ensued, leading to discussions about *Cobra* and a profane critique of *Rocky Balboa*.  The show then focused on Bill Burr's viral YouTube video from a Philadelphia show on the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy Tour, highlighting the audience's drunken behavior and Burr's successful comeback from being initially booed.  They also discussed Jimmy Schubert's bombed performance, referencing a Boston Herald article. The conversation continued to “Assault on the Media” by No Filter Paul, and Opie recounted nearly disrupting a live news broadcast.  This transitioned to discussions about their show's YouTube and Pal Talk presence, including an anecdote involving a cleaning crew.  Further listener calls, rumors of their Chicago show being replaced, and calls from Chicago listeners led to a critique of Robert Fetter from the Chicago Sun Times, discussions of ratings, and plans for a memorable Chicago visit, possibly involving a helicopter dropping money. The segment concluded with Frank Vincent joining the show in studio, discussing his career, including specific scenes from *Jungle Fever*, leading to further offensive commentary on Bob Kelly’s dating experiences with women of different races.


The following segment continued with Frank Vincent in studio.  The conversation started with banter about body odor, transitioning to Vincent's book, "A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man," and off-color humor about gangster movies and sex. A caller, Amanda, was subjected to crude jokes about her race and appearance before hanging up.  The discussion then focused on Vincent's experiences on *The Sopranos*, including scenes with homophobic slurs.  Gambling anecdotes followed, before they played and discussed a poorly-acted radio promo featuring Steve C., with Vincent reenacting lines.  The segment concluded with promotion of Vincent's book and website, and Louis C.K.'s HBO special, including a street segment showing Vincent interacting with New Yorkers.

A phone interview with Steve in Las Vegas for the AVN Expo followed, filled with vulgar and sexually explicit conversations about porn stars, specifically "Alias Sneezy" or "Annette Schwartz."  The conversation shifted to MMA fighters, Chuck Liddell and Kimbo Slice, and callers shared injury anecdotes.  Bob Kelly joined in studio, discussing his emotional responses to videos of midgets and his preferences regarding women bodybuilders and midgets.  An audio clip of Kelly’s knee injury and a remixed version were played. The segment concluded with plugs for Kelly's projects and merchandise.

The next segment began with Opie describing his knee injury, followed by a commercial for Louis C.K.'s special. Post-commercial, the hosts discussed a studio encounter with Frank Vincent, engaging in increasingly vulgar jokes, including speculation about a sexual encounter between Kelly and Vincent.  Opie discussed plans to live-stream his commute, promising reckless driving and racist commentary. A listener called about the use of "no homo," followed by a call from Dee Dee, a radio personality who engaged in sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes about her personal life, including details about past relationships, substance abuse, and a health scare.  Dee Dee promoted her show, "Dee Dee's Basement," leading to a challenge to perform a sexually suggestive phrase on air, which she fulfilled.

The final segment focused on the "Line of the Day" sponsored by Bodogfight.com, featuring crude humor and sexually suggestive remarks.  They critiqued a female radio host's show and Anthony played the "DJ Hole."  Opie struggled to play a song from *Luminous 2*, leading to frustration and vulgar exchanges. Listeners eventually identified the song as "Stroll Around the World" by Star Casino.  The segment ended with closing remarks including racial slurs, boasts about success, promotion of Bodog, and Anthony's intention to drive home recording, expressing frustration about his pay.

[00:05:30]  know and this isn't just a bit i don't i don't really check this uh channel out and it's not as  good as nascar for uh and honestly i kind of can carry yourself too i kind of for the old timers well  yeah i uh i kind of you know forget that this channel is even offered yeah in my cable package  so i'm flipping around at 4 15 in the morning and all i hear is uh and then just a graphic that's 
[00:06:00]  all it is saying no one should blank alone and then the phone number of uh someone you could call to  to you know help you along help you out to help you out a little bit in this fine city i'm like  the first night i moved to new york when i was living on 97th and lex i turned that on and they  don't have anything like that like in boston no and then i come here and it's all i watched it i was  like that was unbelievable what do you do do you um it's the moment they send someone over or that's  just uh that's just the old uh you know yeah you need some help over the phone over the phone oh it's 
[00:06:30]  that yeah yeah sex stuff but then i was yeah and i'm mesmerized just watching like uh you know  commercial after commercial for asian escorts and fetishes and i'm like and then you sit there and go  this is on regular cable that you get in manhattan and every once in a while you get a shemale which is  every once in a while you'll wait like an hour and a half to get in the shemale the variety  rotation but it's what they need diversified sex is the craziest thing too because within a 10 
[00:07:00]  minute period i saw the same escort ad probably 10 times and you just kept watching it why turn the  it was new to me every single time why change the channel they're going why am i watching this  just completely mesmerized you just do god there were there were days where they were there was all  kinds of controversy about like condom ads and things right and now it's just that's all the  commercial was was that and we were talking about the uh the girls gone wild uh commercials which is 
[00:07:30]  absolute spank material you know i don't i i found that one morning too the weirdest crap is on  at 4 4 15 in the morning yeah i haven't i haven't found that infomercial in a while no no but every  once in a while i'll come across that as well and anthony's right that's just like it all i know to watch  years ago growing up that would have been porno like they they put the little girls gone wild logo 
[00:08:00]  over some of the more vital areas that aren't allowed to be on tv but everything else is exposed  you're seeing like bare female hip right from ground zero wrapped around right to the the the  the crack in the back so you're seeing that part that you could definitely use especially if you're  young and growing up just getting into the whole thing that thing that you'll do for the rest of your 
[00:08:30]  life but it's that that's like it's porno on television regular tv yeah great stuff they pretty  much show everything you don't need the video i don't know when this channel starts it's like i  don't know it's like uh uh espn 2 during the day or something whatever yeah who knows what channel  i don't know and then all of a sudden around 10 11 o'clock at night i'm guessing this thing turns  into this uh escort channel you just have over and over upon it and then i'm thinking and i don't  want to blow it for blow it up for anyone else i'm like how is this legal why isn't this being shut 
[00:09:00]  down by the authority authority now can you call the obviously call the one the women i was thinking  of calling just for the hell of it just as a goof and then do you set something up do you maybe  are you able to say hey uh you know come on over oh no dude how much they were escort ads like  call this number and they're gonna they'll send someone they're gonna send an asian beauty to  your door and i'm sure it's just like the the girl in the commercial of course the asian girls are 
[00:09:30]  pretty good do they present it well that's what they do white girls are bad anything white black  or puerto rican you finish asian asians you clearly can't go wrong because they don't gain a lot of  weight during their lives and yeah they pretty much stay the same well the immigrants too you know  they come over and they got the the hierarchy where you start off as the escort or maybe in the  uh yankee cranky shops things like that and then you work your way up to the nail the nail place 
[00:10:00]  nails and foot massages and foot massages and then the ultimate you get to be a waitress in a sushi  restaurant yeah we figured this crap out years and if you screw the order up once you get sent right  back to yankee crank yeah they send you right back down the bottom back back up again there's dry  cleaning in this dry cleaning is uh wow that's a good point those are more of the chinese though  like uh i think the escorts are more japanese they're all the same are they yes right yeah  i look depressed who the hell could figure it out let them figure it out they all look like there's 
[00:10:30]  suns in their face i i i was playing  be careful john lew doesn't like any jokes about the asians very angry oh we're watching you john i was in  uh we were in vegas uh a few days ago and i was i was playing poker and uh asian guys they love to  gamble the asians love to gamble the casino's full of them so there were two asian guys at my poker  table and this other drunk guy and he he goes hey are you two brothers and they were so offended

[00:27:00]  sleepovers and wait for the parents to go to bed and then we would we would turn on these uh channels  that yeah got a little uh saucier a little saucy a little spicier after the parents went to bed who  didn't see last tango in paris and watch marlon brando take a few with that butter and the make some  marshmallow with your friends i remember some soft porn that they had on uh what was it back then it  wasn't hbo or showtime cinemax or whatever it was like skinamax skinamax hbo was like the first one 
[00:27:30]  though so yeah they they had and late at night they did the same thing but cinema 100 on long  island was the one that had the the soft porn was uh based around like uh fairy tales like jack and  jill but uh jack and jill were doing something right right it was only some goofy story it wasn't just  it was not the porn of today she didn't go down the hill she went well yeah yeah it was not the porn of  today it was just this weird stories sometimes it was a musical like there'd be singing and then there  would be like a uh massive orgy in a room with a midget looking through the keyhole oh my god i 
[00:28:00]  remember that one i think that was called fairy tales that's the one i'm talking about it was fairy  tales but it was yeah but it was all soft uh soft core porno yeah any fairy any dream sequence that  needs a midget a midget you need a midget and a dream sequence in a porno that's how you know it's a  dream i've told the story a few times but you know um when i was growing up you know my parents were  very strict i had a curfew and all that crap and uh you know so my dad would kind of wait up on the 
[00:28:30]  couch and he would he would be watching tv and when i got home you know i'm i'm drinking and you know  like anyone else trying to get past my dad making you know without him really knowing how drunk i am  and i just want to get upstairs like i made it again without a big hassle with the parents right  so i come home smashed i mean smashed i'm like oh my god i gotta freaking now wake up my dad  who's in the living room and tell him i'm home i'm like this is not good i walk into the living

[00:30:00]  they used to have like artistic films and i stumbled upon it uh and uh they were completely nude it was  like french film it was unbelievable i found heaven but it was allowed to be on tv because it was in  channel 13 artistic thing it was like crazy man they were completely nude and they were french  so you can imagine what they look like downstairs well back uh back in the old days again uh before  cable pre-cable now we're talking jesus christ uh channel 13 which would be uh in new york our 
[00:30:30]  public television public broadcasting would show um shows from england uh where they had no problem  showing topless monty python was a big show that uh you would watch as a kid because you might catch  an occasional boob shot and then they would show yeah artistic films foreign films they're in another  language but all of a sudden there's a bedroom scene and uh you're seeing maybe some uh some my ass  yeah they didn't do that in boston they did there's nothing when i came to new york i was shocked 
[00:31:00]  when i put on pbs all you guys got was zoom yeah we got zoom and we got we got some type of uh  like bruins network on pbs and candle pin bowling yeah yeah exactly and the i hate blacks uh channel  that's the news well some things are still there all right well it's four five and  five and seven four five and seven i hate the blacks tv great stupid they love it actually i love it 
[00:31:30]  they love their diversity in boston just don't let it ever touch they're organized  they're organized he said he says he makes some money buying a house and a car he's like  this is fun being white oh yeah yeah he's he's he's joining the white world he is he's realizing  what it's like i'm not commenting what's on channel 11 why i'm not going to tie it into this conversation  so shut up don't say a word i'm leaving it alone yeah jack horn is on some talk show hosts in boston  got uh suspended or fired for for the comment you're thinking exactly in your head right now 
[00:32:00]  isn't that jack hannah from uh oh and diego zoo it's adorable what is that it's a little it's it's a  furry thing there you go with paws hey uh getting back to like things that would help you along as a  kid yep pause one of one of my favorites was uh gotta say benny hill benny hill was another one that  was busty nurses with three buttons on your running around in fast motion nothing was better  they would they would show some pretty hot girls it used to piss me off though i mean i don't know 
[00:32:30]  if i was a complete like you know psychopath porn guy at the age of like 10 but i used to watch that  and go come on what you wanted more right to the edge and then be like i want more are you one of  these guys that switch to the old man running after him doing the whole thing for them are you one of  these guys that uh well probably not that you want uh something left to the imagination or you  want just completely nude i know i i don't mind i i think anthony's completely nude guy right i like 
[00:33:00]  totally nude women i like it but i like a payoff in a scenario maybe a little under the covers action  i don't mind that but knowing that something's going to happen benny hill really pissed me off  growing up what i want in my porn what some good acting what just some good acting acting i like no i'm with  you know i like a little good scenario they take you away from i want to feel like this uh this this  woman really owns that house and it's it's her pool and that guy really is a pool guy he knows what  he's doing you remember uh i don't want the bright lights where it looks like a set i want a little 
[00:33:30]  skank uh with my porn a little realism remember cheerleaders movie cheerleaders it was on around  the same time as fairy tales it was a huge porno that was on uh softcore porn they got a little  hardcore back uh on cable very early on and uh it was cheerleaders of course and their mission  was to go to the other to the opposing teams of the team they cheered for and just you know 
[00:34:00]  take care of them so they couldn't possibly play the game the next day i remember that i actually do  remember that one now that you say and it's the best part was that these cheerleaders were like  in their 30s they were just yeah hey let's go help out the team smoking luckies  just got a c-section yeah supposed to be like 16 17 uh let's say hi to tommy in jersey  tommy what's going on hey what's up guys hey you guys remember the gorgeous ladies of wrestling 
[00:34:30]  uh yes glow glow the glow girls the glow girls would get the job done yeah that's when uh like  wwf uh had their girls on their wrestling on uh on the squad and uh somebody picked up on the fact  that hey guys kind of like watching girls yeah wrestling so they made an entire thing glow that's  that's a scene from uh i'm distracted because they're showing a scene from cheerleaders there's a scene  uh bobby take a look and there she is taking care of the other team so they can't play so they're a 
[00:35:00]  bit tired this by the way was just the ultimate way when then when uh cinema 100 would play this  all my friends would come over it would be like friday or saturday uh night and my mother would be  out working she used to work at a disco there's a waitress at a disco and all my friends would come  pulling up they'd watch her little honda leave and all my friends cars would come pulling up  it was a party beers pot any everything you can imagine and then we would turn on porno 
[00:35:30]  and uh it was great cheerleaders watch it like five times in a row pigtails to make you look younger  and did you see what she was sporting she could have had another set of pigtails somewhere else  but everybody has tan lines yeah that's what i love about the old days they're natural girls man  look at that look at that she looks like she's wearing a bikini she does she does it's fantastic 
[00:36:00]  what was that oh my god you can get nude on a film but you can't get nude in your backyard you horse  that's great yeah she's look those are my favorite oh my god that makes her look like an alien  you know you're just you're not used to seeing that anymore so you're like wow is that an alien is  that a is that a female from another planet that is she got dr j in a in a headlock  it looks it really does look like a thumb puppet look at that that is unnaturally natural it looks 
[00:36:30]  like kid from kid and play kid and play wow did we find a new species of woman this is like  that how foreign does that look now when you look back and see that i don't think that looks so foreign  i don't think it even i don't even think it comes like that anymore like out of the package yeah no  like i don't think i know how girls take care of themselves these days and make sure they're well 
[00:37:00]  groomed and everything and all nice yeah but i think if they totally let themselves go it doesn't  end up like that no i think genetics has just changed everything where you can't possibly get  the is that an isosceles triangle i don't know what that is saying we've evolved in the last we have  evolved we're another species we're further a little further from the ape than we were back in the  70s because my god that looks like bonzo is uh in her uh they keep talking about how we're but 
[00:37:30]  he's a fraggle she is a fraggle they keep talking about how we're losing a finger slowly but surely  or whatever over time we'll be down to four or something like that well this is going a lot  faster this this uh this action yeah because you can't even do that anymore i don't think thank you  mr skin by the way mr skin.com the cheerleaders from 1972 was that 72 no 19 i was 72 no way wow i was 
[00:38:00]  too good it's got to be later than 72 mike on uh long island did you really get a date on that yeah  mike on long island what's up i would say 76 huh what's up dickos listen you guys forgot the best  workout show ever made yeah body shaping body shaping was that the one with the blonde  and they were always on the beach fantastic show yeah that was a good well one of those girls is  now in uh on uh uh best damn talk show or whatever right right huh and they had songs and no bras and 
[00:38:30]  no it's just amazing show all right who's working out on a beach that's hot yeah i mean like physically  temperature wise who would be too hot let's go to kenneth let's throw mats out and just get  naked and start working out ken yeah man what's up you guys remember uh the series emmanuel i think  it's still running but man that was my first introduction to softball there were so many of 
[00:39:00]  the emmanuel series uh yeah and and those if you saw the name emmanuel you just knew you were watching  it that night i like lady chatterley lady chatterley's lover which one was uh was uh what's  his name from uh home alone buzz oh buzz's father buzz's father was in one of them yeah i think it  was lady chatterley's lover yeah maybe the first one maybe the first one and he was uh the gardener  or something yeah and we had him on the show and talked to him about it and he didn't even want to 
[00:39:30]  discuss it so the next time he came in we had the video and played it for him and he had to watch his  dad getting it on with some chick he's like screaming no stop it getting it i don't want to  see this getting it on with an alien chick an alien oh my god forget about it ruined it for me now  she had a b1 bomber in her lap yeah right on hey we gotta break into this and say how to a big star  donald trump there he is good morning fellas donald trump how are you very good what's new 
[00:40:00]  what's new sir yeah very little haven't seen you in the news lately you really gotta you gotta do  something to get your name back out there it's a very very low-key week it certainly is is it  finally calming down well i hope so it would be nice if it would calm down i've been trying not to  do any interviews i've been trying to keep it low-key but you know when somebody says something i  like you guys i respond and i guess yeah respond in somewhat of an inflammatory way but people say 
[00:40:30]  things and you respond you know what i like someone hits you with a pea shooter you fire a howitzer back  at him you have to do it that's the only way you stay alive in this game when you deal with scum you  have to treat them like scum so it's one of those things did you ever did you ever previously have a  problem with her or was it like right off the bat you saw what she was doing kind of goofing on you  yeah i mean the miss yose thing was really sort of a ruse by her i've known her for a long time  and you know i've i've she knows that i understand her well she knows i know she's not very bright and 
[00:41:00]  i've let her be i'd let it be known also so i mean there's been a little bit of a history didn't  she go to one of your weddings can you believe that one she did right i thought so it wasn't on my  behalf you didn't invite her personally i did it wasn't from me did she insist on ordering the fish  she ate plenty she ate plenty you know you gave them great ratings right i gave them great ratings  but you know what that'll end immediately after we're finished you know uh her ratings tanked with 
[00:41:30]  her first show you know why you can't take her in large doses she'll do fine it's the only way you  can take her donald yeah unfortunately but but what will happen is when i'm finished with this  her ratings will tank like you've never seen before now the whole barber thing uh  we're getting conflicting reports here whether you guys were friends because now she came out in  defense of rosie yet you're saying that behind the scenes she's saying oh my god i can't take  working with this woman it's hard you know i like to believe the donald here but uh how do we know 
[00:42:00]  this is uh what's actually happening she called me i mean she called me from her vacation after rosie  went into a rant and rave and she called me now barbara and i were friends and i understood why  barbara defended rosie because she really had to i fully understood that but yeah business move in  all fairness in all fairness to barbara you know she was just she's being pushed around like a puppet  it's a terrible way to end her career in my opinion she's being pushed around by this animal and  it's it's too bad that she has to end her career that way yeah you you think uh rosie's gonna last 
[00:42:30]  there or she's gonna uh she'll self-destruct she always self-destructs well they're talking that she  might have her own show soon and that won't do well it'll start off good and then it'll fade fast  yeah and you heard of course that madonna is now sticking up for rosie o'donnell  yeah in a very lukewarm way i watched that i thought that was fine i mean they've been friends  over the years what started the whole thing uh was uh you know you gave this girl another shot  and for some reason which by the way i thought was brilliant right because it usually 
[00:43:00]  well because no one ever gets a second chance rosie would have given her a second chance i  guarantee you that oh i'm sure believe me in a different sense yeah but she would have given  her many many chances as many as she could oh man but but i gave her a second chance and you know  rosie went nuts over the second chance but basically rosie rosie understands that i know her and rosie  went more nuts over me than she did over her yeah i like those things it's okay i think uh yeah the 
[00:43:30]  second chance thing was great that girl's beautiful beautiful by the way you talk about  a girl see and you know rosie didn't like the fact that i the people said why is it such a big story  you know it's become the number one story by far on the internet and yeah i said well you have beauty  and you have the beast and rosie went nuts but rosie is a beast you know you look at her people said oh  you shouldn't say that she's this or that i said take a look am i lying and they're going uh what  you know the it's the honesty whether you people agree with you or not no one is as blatantly honest 
[00:44:00]  as you are when it comes to show business everyone keeps their mouth shut they try to be polite and  nice and not burn any bridges or anything that like that so that's why people are so captivated by this  you are coming out and saying things that uh you know a lot of people have thought of and you have  to understand when you deal with scum you know rosie's a liar rosie said i went bankrupt i never went  bankrupt rosie said oh she talks about my hair i'm not allowed to say she looks like a slob and 
[00:44:30]  yet she can talk about my hair so some people said oh donald you've been so personal i said what about  her i mean look at the way she is so you know it's sort of interesting actually i was on the today show  the other day and meredith veera said donald did you call her crude i said no i called her degenerate  yeah i called her a slob yeah crude i called her a you know lots of other things but crude that was too  nicer word i think uh what was brilliant also was during your opening salvo how you threatened uh to  take away her girlfriend yeah no i think it would be very easy honestly if i weren't married i'd have 
[00:45:00]  no trouble but because of the fact that i'm married i have many friends that would be capable of taking  her girlfriend away in my opinion very quickly donald knows how to fight like take it down a street  level which is nice you see a businessman like you usually these things are behind closed doors  they're uh handled by lawyers uh to see you uh a very successful businessman over the years  just take the gloves off it was refreshing and i think that's why it's getting so much uh coverage 
[00:45:30]  well i think it's right because everyone wants to be politically correct you watch these politicians  and you know they they if they see a girl who's 21 years old they call her a woman and because they  they would hate like hell to call her a girl because that would be terrible and they'll be criticized  i mean give me a break so you know you see all these politically correct people and you know what  people are tired of it people want to hear the talk and you know just so you understand i went to  the number one school in the country the wharton school of finance i was a great student and all  that stuff so there's plenty of brain power there but this uh this whole thing with rosie sometimes 
[00:46:00]  you have to when you're dealing in the gutter you have to get in the gutter yeah it's really  refreshing and some advice from us i i hope you don't stop anytime soon now you should say  something bad about madonna and let other people pile on and you should just take on all of  hollywood start punching people in your casinos i know a lot of people you guys all want me to do  that my problem is i'm building buildings all over the place you know it's hard when you're building  buildings right but you know i have to devote a little time to that but because i could be all  day long i mean i've been asked to do interviews by the thousands literally everybody and it's really 
[00:46:30]  funny again i go on the today show and meredith asks me uh about rosie yeah and she asked you  probably saw this it's very famous now and then she goes another rosie question yeah and after two  questions she's this is how she starts the interview i'm just sitting there yeah and then  she goes why do you always talk about rosie i said because you asked me questions you just asked  questions and then she goes of course i'm asking you questions donald's the most popular story in  the whole country maybe the world and she's telling me this but she says why do you talk about rosie  yeah donald i just want to give you a heads up and a little warning there's a rumor going around 
[00:47:00]  that uh rosie is threatening to uh take your beautiful girlfriend uh grab her and climb the trump  tower and swat it by planes well so uh be careful of that one you know let me tell you anything rose  yeah anthony uh just had an awful line and you just didn't even acknowledge it that's okay i mean jesus  i did myself but first of all he's married hey uh donald uh something that was really interesting i  watch regis every once in a while and uh you're on there uh right in the middle of this controversy 
[00:47:30]  right and they didn't talk about it whatsoever what was that about on regis yeah because regis  is one of the nicest human beings in the world and he didn't want to mix it up and that stuff you  know it's not his kind of a show right his show is based on nice right he's not shocking sweet guy  he's a great friend of mine and you're right it was very interesting a number of people have brought  that up because right now everyone's really into it so of course they see that donald trump's going to 
[00:48:00]  be on regis and kelly they're all tuning in to see what you can say there i actually ask people  don't talk about rosie let's talk about other things you know we have the apprentice going on  on sunday night there was another thing she said the apprentice it did badly the apprentice was the  number one show in that time slot in 14 months oh boy and i have to listen to her say oh the  apprentice tanked or something the apprentice after six seasons continues to do well it's amazing and  and you know this is the best season i think we've ever done and everyone's seeing it so  it's on by the way it happens to be on sunday at nine o'clock but now we'll get back to the slob 
[00:48:30]  you know what i like about the new apprentice what's the deal with uh some living in tents and  some living in luxury you wanted that's right i mean we have the losing team lives in a tent and  it's really disgusting after a few nights because it starts to rain and i mean they're living literally  in mud and the winning team lives in this gorgeous mansion and it's it's a really it's you know it gives  you a lot of incentive to win hell yeah well i'd rather live in the mansion and it's uh in uh california  for the first time california that's correct why did you decide to do that well it was a decision 
[00:49:00]  because we've done five from new york and you know it had done really well and continues to do really  well but it was time to make a change and next time we may go to miami or las vegas or someplace else  you know so we're going to move it around a little bit hey donald you have any uh desire to get on the  phone with a listener that thinks your uh comments to rosie are terrible not particularly what it's  mallory though from florida yeah sure we'll get put her on all right uh mallory hi this is very 
[00:49:30]  this is a very special thing we don't allow our listeners to talk to uh mr trump but uh you're on  the phone with donald trump hello donald trump how are you hello hello mallory  how are you make it fast mallory he's a very busy man he's losing money as he uh sits on the phone here  okay i just want to let you know that i just don't like your comments to rosie i just i mean  yeah you know sometimes your comparison to being a fat bobbin and bad hair you know come on come on  come on that's all you got i fully understand what you're saying and there are some people that don't 
[00:50:00]  like the level of my comments but i don't mean to be rude i think you're really when you deal with  garbage you have to deal like garbage sometimes you know it's one of those mincing words and you  know i i think you're a very nice woman and i appreciate it and i appreciate the nice tone of  your question thank you hey donald you've you've been all over the news uh lately there was another  story that i'm loving but uh they're not talking about anymore because of the rosie o'donnell thing  but the the huge flag you're flying down there in um in uh um uh florida that's right i put up a 
[00:50:30]  flag in palm beach florida at my club called the mar-a-lago club and the town of palm beach wants me to  rip down the flag and it's a massive flag and it's too high or something like that but it's the  same size as in front of you know very big buildings in washington dc and and mar-a-lago  is bigger than many of them and so he's showing his patriotism and the town's saying no you got to  take that flag down the american flag it's actually a huge story and it's um you know it's it's become  a very big story it's a very important story and they want me to rip down the american flag and i'm 
[00:51:00]  not doing it and i actually sued them for 25 million with all proceeds going to the returning  iraqi war soldiers very good and they're fining you what uh like 250 a day or something ridiculous  they haven't started that yet but they probably will i think they're making a terrible 250 a day  and what's great is like he's standing up to these people other people most people would just fold and  donald's like screw you i'm not taking it down ever and and they don't know what to do now they're  like but yeah but you gotta take it down well they told me you need permits to put up the american 
[00:51:30]  flag i said you don't need permits to put up the american flag since when oh and it's really  become a very big uh it's really become very big so it's very interesting all right any comments about  madonna no i i think she did come on i'm helping you out let's keep the story going no she was  respectful she she knows rosie and you know between you and i they had their own rift everybody has a  rift with rosie she's a she's an animal but they had their own rift years ago but she likens herself 
[00:52:00]  to a friend of rosie and and she said you know i'm a friend of rosie but she said nothing bad about me  and by the way if she did i would attack her yeah yeah because there's a lot you can attack her on  okay yeah that's well that's true okay fellas all right don't let this story uh die anytime soon  it's a lot of fun it's good to see it's very refreshing fellas everyone says let it die let  it die and then there's 500 calls from you people saying please please please go on we're vultures  you know when it dies when it dies is when people lose interest yeah right but you know people for 
[00:52:30]  whatever reason they're fascinated but i think because basically i've taken down a bully  well yeah uh she's been a bully she she hurt danny devito she hurt kelly ripper she hurt remember  tom sellick tom sellick was blindsided on uh her show regardless of what your belief is in gun  control uh he was brought that was yeah he was brought on as a guest of the show and she proceeded  to just lambast him about his beliefs on the second amendment and uh it's ridiculous he was so blind 
[00:53:00]  so i've never forgotten that it was vicious and she's a vicious person and you have to treat him  that way i mean it's just one of those things we really have no choice do we no all right i like it  i like the way you uh you're standing up for this and uh i like you not backing down yeah give the  big plug for the apprentice donald okay well the apprentice is on on sunday night at nine o'clock  we have a very young smart audience and we do very well and it's really a great show i think it might  be as good as number one and that's saying something because number one became the number 
[00:53:30]  one show on television yep and we had a lot of fun last year getting the guys that were getting  kicked off on our show what's going on with that well if you want we can give them to you again  yeah we'll uh we'll be in touch okay you be in touch with us all right donald thanks fellas great  show uh thank you sir so long donald trump everyone because donald boy he is just wrapped  up in this rosie thing i don't want to say anything because i have the same torso as rosie i oh do you  i look someone actually said that i look exactly like rosie donald now i just want to keep my mouth  shut before he attacked me he wasn't even scheduled to call today out of nowhere i look down it's 
[00:54:00]  donald trump i'm like you got to go to donald trump goto he's vicious i love it oh  man wow they're an animal an animal a beast garbage i just love that he's not being pc because that  you know that's what's been going on for a really long time in media and it's so effing annoying you  know when there's a problem and usually it's through a publicist that says no there's no problem  there was something a word was said but that was a misunderstanding and then you get donald 
[00:54:30]  she's just an animal she's a pig she's this she's a loud mouth a bully uh garbage yeah  that'll steal her girlfriend if i wasn't married you know he you know he wants to say some derogatory  things about her sex you know yeah well i i think he he did a couple of things like he alluded to the  softball catcher the best though you know i forgot to tell him this no one's gonna want to talk to him  anymore though because obviously barbara walters said all that stuff and confidence like she can't 
[00:55:00]  stand rosie and all that obviously well it's obvious to me i wasn't part of the phone call  that you know barbara walters was trashing rosie to donald trump yeah and donald trump decided to use  that card and then uh barbara walters had to make believe she never had that conversation never said  that and then she had to come out on the view and kind of support rosie but from what i hear there  was a big blowout in uh the makeup room yeah between rosie well they talked about that uh  yesterday on the view and yeah they kind of high-fived and said you know all's good in our 
[00:55:30]  world but there was a problem yeah rosie got pissed that during the vacation uh barbara didn't call her  and was on the news keeping this whole thing going and uh not really defending her and they had a big  blowout but rosie makes the view very very interesting barbara walters is a waste yeah she really is  whether you love her or hate her you know rosie's making that show you know watchable yeah so i  don't know yeah she is it's just kind of a lot of fun i like this i just love watching people tear

[01:06:00]  the csi  david caruso's bank  david caruso's school of acting  yeah  wow was that bad  i remember  i remember  with uh  dramatic music  i remember watching that movie  what was that one  cobra  cobra  you can barely understand anything he said  he went for the more subdued  uh  guy  sylvester stallone  uh  one dimensional character  went for the more subdued one  instead of these ramble ones  hey  hey 
[01:06:30]  they drew first blood  they  it was like  yeah  uh  you're the disease  i'm the cure  yeah  i don't deal with psychos  what  what  i'm a psycho and everything but i i still i i got normal hearing  i  i don't deal with psychos  why  you don't  you don't drive a volvo  what  your soul is pure  i don't understand you 
[01:07:00]  before you shoot me  could you articulate what you're saying  because i really need to know  i need to know  don't leave me hanging here  i'm a psycho but i really i need i can't hear you  you're a type of fish  you're a type of fish  what are you saying  i think he said he does photography  oh forget it  shoot me  hilarious  all right listen  i hated cabretti  what a coincidence 
[01:07:30]  what a  what a convenient coincidence  his last name is cabretti and they called him cobra  how cool  all right well  what you want spaghetti  no  i have any rage  you  you're serving  something about spaghetti  what does he want  i  you  you  you  there's fewer  spaghettis than pure  what  that was the worst movie 
[01:08:00]  well danny's gonna find more uh  more scenes that uh  oh please  that work with the david caruso delivery so  that's the funniest thing  it's awful  what what part  that's just  subdued one-dimensional  ass  you want spaghetti  i haven't seen the new rocky  have you  i have yes  is it good  he wins  thanks  he doesn't  who cares  and then he ruins it anyway 
[01:08:30]  no he doesn't win  but he does  nobody does  spiritually  it's i i  i look it was it replaced five for me five was awful  horrid  horrid  you know it was it was rocky i mean you still you got excited when he was running up the steps  yeah you know this time though he was running through philly they'd be throwing stuff at him  of course  you suck dude  hey fatso rocky would you gain weight  and they're not rooting for rocky anymore  nah 
[01:09:00]  i like to tear their heroes down  philly would they attack him  um  yeah he it was a good movie it was good i like sly he's a good actor  you know what i i just i hear like things about it and it just annoys me  did he at one point when they were talking about adrian who's dead now  did he say yes you got the woman cancer  did he say that  yeah he did  oh  he really said that  well yeah how'd it go again  because you know something there there was a point where rocky won 
[01:09:30]  he was just kind of a mook  right  innocent  right  kind of that  and then throughout the rockies he became like this profound guy  and now he's back to being retarded  he can't even understand what disease his wife died of  yeah  breast uterine ovarian something just  she died  of  the woman cancer  the woman cancer  yeah  he's talking like an infant 
[01:10:00]  there was a funny part though where he uh the  can i can i reveal a  kind of funny part of the movie  do i even care  you know the girl that he told he walked home in the first one and she said hey rocky go screw yourself  yeah  yeah  she  is  she's the new adrian  she's the new adrian  kind of  they don't fool around  giving him the inspiration  you can do it rock  no she kind of gives a sacrifice  saying don't  god forbid that rocky decides he needs some pooha now that he's alone again  right well it was kind of dirty because she was like you know 13 when they first met  but uh she 
[01:10:30]  she he walks into the door and then there's a big tall black kid with braids and then this  white kid and she's like that's my son over there he goes oh he's a good looking kid  you know it seems like you know something like that about the white kid she goes no it's not the white kid it's the it's the black and the black kid and there was just this he  rocky looking like oh and then there's silence in the movie theater and then everybody just started dying like  rocky's like the black kid  you slept with a black guy  i can't believe you dated 
[01:11:00]  whoa hey hey  you know i'm  i'm all for you know loving everything in the city of brotherly loving it all but you know to go out with  how did you tell your father  you know it's amazing  you shouldn't be bringing  you're a pretty white girl you find another decent white gentleman out there you didn't have to go for the 
[01:11:30]  don't worry al anthony's a professional  i guess you enjoy the big  because  i'm known to have  what do you like it in  and the  you like big  in here  what is he sticky  what is it in here  you can find a white guy i'm sure he liked it  but if you like 
[01:12:00]  put in there  in here  then i guess you're doing fine  wow  wow  gotta see that now  you gotta see it  it listens pretty good  donald trump made us really late  so we gotta step aside again 
[01:12:30]  damn donald  uh listen we go to break with the david caruso montage  one of the montages we were playing on yesterday's show  montage  come on there iraq  jesus he got one thing to do every morning  he screws it up  he screws it up every time  it's the opian anthony show  listen to this and uh  and we'll return  basically means we gotta drive by  drive by  miami style  i don't think so  you don't spend a thousand dollars on clothes 
[01:13:00]  that you're never gonna wear  a hundred people throwing golf balls at the sight of a death  those odds are very slim aren't they  so the question becomes  alex was the mob sent to draw us to the crime scene  or sent to destroy it  we only had one week before deliberations  no need now  the verdict is in  five minutes  they call it speed dating  one of our victims had 15 days 
[01:13:30]  well you know what they say frank  speed kills  you don't fall three stories  get up and run away  you do  you've got something to hide  where is patrick now  well i don't know  he's missing from the scene  maybe he took off  well maybe  he got taken for a ride  it's the opian anthony show  ah you got that right 
[01:14:00]  the opian anthony show  the o and a virus spreading across america  bob kelly in studio  our phone number  1-866-313-FREE  we're all over the news today by the way  we made the paper in chicago  we made the paper in boston  and we made the paper here in new york city  i guess we start with the boston herald  bill burr is up in boston this weekend at the comedy connection 
[01:14:30]  very funny guy does our show all the time  yeah he was uh he's up there this week  i was just there last week  and how are the crowds  the crowds are uh the crowds are great  last week after new year's it was really good  so uh uh you know he's up there this week  and then uh and  he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna go see bill burr  he's very funny  well uh the boston herald  you know when you guys come to town  they'd like to do a little piece on you  yeah  and the piece on bill burr  and the boston herald today  uh rocky tirade lifts burr to youtube 
[01:15:00]  stardom  oh the  the time he took on the philly crowd  during the uh  o and a traveling virus  he took on 10,000 people  uh he he says in the article that uh  the ideal comedy show is 90 minutes long  and i went on  three hours and 15 minutes into the show  he's basically saying that uh  everyone in philly got completely hammered  by the time they  he got on stage  no one wanted to listen to comedy anymore  so they started booing him  and they had no real right to boo him  well they did because they're  you know it's philly 
[01:15:30]  but it wasn't like he  he was sucking or anything  they just didn't feel like hearing comedy anymore  no matter who you were  philly would boo the pope  right they were done  so uh they talk about the boston herald today  how you know he took on philly  and he turned the crowd around  uh for the most part  and that uh the video  of the tirade uh  appeared on youtube  and has been watched over 160,000 times  that's amazing  actually they they don't got that right  there's one version that uh  has been viewed 160,000 times on youtube 
[01:16:00]  there's another version that's up to like uh  i think 40,000  and there's another version that actually had five hits yet  five  add it in  add that in  so and they talk about the opie and anthony show  and all that  so there you go uh  the boss  boss and herald  talking about us and bill burr today  that had to be one of the  the greatest comic moments i've ever seen  because you know we do comedy  and there's so many  there's so many times  where you bomb  or a crowd turns on you  yep  and you know you get to be there  and see it's not you  you get to see somebody else  just bomb 
[01:16:30]  which to a comic is beautiful  it's just fun to see  yeah your comics  i never understood this  comics love watching other comics  go through  the worst experience possible for a comic  oh because you know he's just going to be yapping about it  the whole car ride home  trying to you know  figure out what happened  and you're going to have to go  dude it happens  that's like a race car driver  just enjoying watching someone plow into the wall  it's the exact  you want to see the car crash  and but that car crash was the ultimate  that was it was 12,000 people 
[01:17:00]  and then they booed Dom Irera  okay so it gets a little nervous  so now everybody's shaking  well they booed uh  jimmy schubert to start the show  oh yeah  schubert first  and schubert's a funny guy  he just blew it  he wouldn't acknowledge the boos  which was the stupidest thing ever  he just plowed through his material  thinking he was going to turn them around  read the audience that night  it was like dude  this is a rare thing that is happening in Philly tonight  you've got to acknowledge this  right  but he went on with his material  and he just got destroyed  he left the stage early 
[01:17:30]  yelling and screaming  all pissed off  because his whole family was in the front row  invite your family to an O&A virus show  with 12,000 people  that's not the show you invite them to  you invite them to the nice little gig  in like you know Cape Cod  we were playing  we were playing scenarios  on the way home from Philly  back to New York  I was driving with Jim Norton  and I'm like  what do you think  Jimmy Schubert's saying to his family right now  at brunch  because you know  it was a homecoming for him  he's from the Philly area 
[01:18:00]  he's playing in front of  about 12,000 people  and he completely bombed  in front of his mom  and dad  and his brothers  but the fact that  Billy saved everybody  because you know  if Billy didn't bomb  then Schubert and M.I. Rambo  would have been on YouTube  them bombing  right  Billy went out  and took a couple hits  and then just lost his mind  and turned it around  I've never seen anything like that  never seen a comic  just take on  12,000 people  he took on  the city of Philadelphia 
[01:18:30]  and every sports team  his  what amazed me  and I've said it before  was just his  knowledge  knowledge  of Philly  in order to have  that type of ammunition  you know  he's hated  he's hated Philly  that whole thing  was already done  in his brain  on the car ride  to Philly  every gig he had  at Helium  three years before that  that was all  just old material  in his head  that's when he  when he saw  anything on the news  about Philly  yeah they threw snowballs  at Santa Claus  that stupid town 
[01:19:00]  and he just started  flipping out  in front of his TV  put it in the back  of his head somewhere  just knew  it would come in useful  someday  waiting for an opportunity  and it happened  over the summer  so the Boston Herald  is talking about this  even though we haven't  talked about this  in I don't know  four or five months now  Rocky Tyrade lifts Burr  to YouTube stardom  there's no such thing  as bad publicity  it's a motto  comedian Bill Burr  has lived by  for the past four months  in September  as part of Shock Jock's  Opie and Anthony's  Traveling Virus Comedy Tour  Burr who plays  the Comedy Connection  this weekend  was booed by  10,000 hard partying 
[01:19:30]  Philadelphians  at the Camden Tweeter Center  not content to stand there  and take it  nor to get off the stage  the Canton native  unloaded a hilarious  obscenity riddled  set  decrying  decreeing  a decree  decreeing  or a decrying  decrying  whatever  dumb writers  stupid writers  why don't you keep it simple  yeah he had to add that in  because I'm a writer  yeah because you went to  journalism school  who gives a crap  a decree  breaking from his 
[01:20:00]  usual material  he hammered  anything that  popped into his head  from the Eagles  to Rocky  to the Liberty Bell  naturally the next day  a video of the tirade  appeared on YouTube  and has been watched  about 160,000 times since  the crowd  has been drinking  for like two hours  before the show  even started  and they booed  the first guy off stage  said Burr  from his New York City home  even the comics  that were doing well  were getting booed  from the back  the ideal comedy show  is 90 minutes long  and I went on  three hours and 15 minutes  into the show  and it goes on from there  but for the new listeners 
[01:20:30]  because we're gaining  new listeners every day  the video's up on YouTube  it is so worth checking out  just pop Opie and Anthony  or actually maybe  pop Bill Burr  into the search engine  Bill Burr and Opie and Anthony  he could dish it out  you'll find it fast  and he could take it  I tell you  let's correct something  though  the other comics  that were doing well  we weren't getting booed  so don't throw us in there Bill  no Bob Kelly  did not get booed  no neither did Jim Norton  and Chris O'Neill  we had a little fun  I love Philly 
[01:21:00]  it was a great time for me  but I want to make it  perfectly clear  they weren't booing his material  it was just  one of those things  can I just say something  the best part about that too  is that he snapped  trashed him  trashed him  got a huge laugh  and then that's where  you walk off  and he goes  and I'm still doing my job  yeah he goes  I'm staying  he goes  you know  he's looking at the timer  and saying no  what do I got  I got five minutes left  you're getting five minutes  I'm not leaving  I'm not leaving the stage  but when his time did run out  and he said goodnight  and he walked off  he got a standing ovation  yeah  well I mean  there were still a few guys 
[01:21:30]  that wanted to strangle  no no no  angry people  because he had pounded  but there was definitely  a lot of people said  you know what  alright you turned us around  this is pretty cool  he took it  you're right  they knew they were seeing  like a moment  like something that just  doesn't happen every day  he took it  yeah  yeah  and everyone has their  favorite part of mine  is when he just  he's looking at the countdown clock  because all the comedians  were kind of timed  so the show wouldn't go all night  yeah  and all of a sudden  he just yells out  one minute left in the period  anyway so  we've also made 
[01:22:00]  the New York Daily News  the New York paper today  the Pest  shout out to the ONA Pest today  you guys got some ink  let's see  in Richard Huff's column  it's really fast  it says  Opie and Anthony's fans  or as the radio duo  call them  Pests  showed up behind  Channel 5's Linda Schmidt  last week  while she did a stand up report  in Hamilton Heights  about subway hero  Wes Autry  they yelled a bit  but didn't interrupt  Schmidt's shot  there you go  so they're reporting  on the latest assault 
[01:22:30]  on the media  that No Filter Paul did  and for the new listeners  the assault on the media thing  is just beyond amazing  taking on a life of its own  and No Filter Paul  I gotta give the guy props  as much as I hate him  he's really doing a lot  for the show lately  as much as I hate him  I just hate the guy  as an individual  but  take it Opie  yeah but  you know what  but he does great things  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  his face  it looks like a face  that just stopped growing  that's what I say  his head is too small  for his body 
[01:23:00]  the back of his head  is like regular man size  and the front is like  a 13 year old boy face  he looks like  he should be a character  from Men in Black  yeah like  he's a punk  what the hell's going on  with his head  go to him for weapons  it looks like he  didn't get enough oxygen  to his head  while he was being born  or something  just decided to stop growing  when he was 8  or something  Beetlejuice head  he is definitely  a fan of the show though  yeah  he jumps right in there man  thank God bless him for that 
[01:23:30]  and what he did  he found all the assault  on the media clips  that we've been doing  for years now  at this point  there's gotta be  20 to 30 of them now  where we just  pretty much beat up  the local news  and make their lives  a living hell  those videos are now  available on YouTube  just throw assault  on the media  into the search engine  you'll laugh for hours  I'm telling you  for hours  you know what happened  the other day  I was out  last weekend  it was Friday  or something  walking around  you know there's 
[01:24:00]  television studios  everywhere in New York City  and a lot of them  now have them  on the ground level  of the buildings  with the glass  so that the  you can see the  passersby  as you're doing  your little news  or whatever it is  you're doing  and there was  I guess there's a  New York sports  network or something  I don't even know  what it is  but there were people  outside a window  and I'm walking by  me and my girlfriend  a couple of our friends  and stuff  we're walking by  and I see this kid  and he's kind of waving  and they're doing a broadcast  from inside 
[01:24:30]  a live sports broadcast  don't tell me  you did a little  look  I stood  I stood right there  I stood right there  and one of  my girlfriend's friends  had drawn a wow  on a sign  and was ready  to hold it up  and the director  looked out the window  saw me  smiled  went on his little mic  to talk  and then two of these  other like  hyper  you know  hyper women  assistant director  things  whatever they are  come running out 
[01:25:00]  and pushed the cameras in  so it was just a tight shot  on the two guys  they thought you were  going to do something  and I was just going to  whip out my  I was going to do  whatever I had to do  to ruin that broadcast  we really got the media  really paranoid  here in New York City  oh they were petrified  especially yeah  and this is a channel  that would have you know  been able to use the publicity  never heard of it before  you got a guy fired  huh  you got a guy fired  dude I was looking at  hey he cursed  the guy's been working  for like 10 years  to get a career 
[01:25:30]  he finally got  potty mouth  look this radio show  is a lot different  than other shows  we call it the ONA experience  there's so much to do  after we get off the air  I highly recommend  you throw a salt  on the media  into the YouTube search  maybe Opie and Anthony  that will help you as well  some of these videos  that these guys  have done over the years  are just out loud  funny man  I watched the one  where they held up  the C word  holy crap  is that one of the  funniest things  you'll ever see  ever  that is a good one 
[01:26:00]  and now they're all  up on YouTube  I was on Pal Talk  last night also  for a while  from the house  because I like  broadcasting from my house  to Pal Talk  when the Mexicans  come over  to vacuum  yeah  I got these Mexicans  they come over  and vacuum  pretty cheap  I like how the Mexicans work  hey would they vacuum  your house  yeah they like  they come over  with those  Buck Rodriguez  backpacks  on  it's like a vacuum  back  backpack  I was saying 
[01:26:30]  if immigration  chills up  it turns into a rocket  and they shoot  through my roof  to get out of the way  but  so  one of them  was in the background  on her hands  and knees  kind of doing something  getting something  off the floor  so I took a pen  and on the Pal Talk  camera  it looked like  I was jamming  the pen  somewhere  this is the type  of stuff we do  and someone was even saying  Jesus Christ  he's acting like a child  that's great  as I'm drinking a beer  and just  you have great pubes 
[01:27:00]  and you  you're playing on a  video cam  sticking a pen  in a Mexican's butt  it was a lot of fun  you don't have kids  but that's part  of the experience  that just goes on  after this show's over  you know  that  today I'm gonna try  if you wanna log on  to Pal Talk  I brought the laptop in  with the air card  and the camera  I'm gonna see  if perhaps  I can have the  commute home cam  so you can see  my road rage  in full action 
[01:27:30]  if you are  offended  by racial epithets  do not tune in  to my drive home  on Pal Talk  because  you  everybody  is  some type of savage  except  me driving  see the show  is just so much  different than any other one  it just continues  even when we're  off the air  let's say hi to Jack  in Chicago  there's rumors  that over the weekend  on WCKG  they were talking  about placing  a financial talk show  in for the 
[01:28:00]  morning drive  that would be  our show  really  there's rumors  they were gonna  replace us  with a financial  talk show  and then  GDI for Chicago  on the instant feedback  he writes  please don't let  that happen  Jack in Chicago  what's up  hey good morning  boys  I want to deliver  my ONA-ism  and David Caruso  but I'll leave  the comedy up  to the professionals  alright  I hope to god  they don't return  on a financial  talk show  no one would know  about that announcement  because nobody  listens to the station  other than when 
[01:28:30]  you're on it  well honestly  we gotta keep it  honest on this show  we're still not  showing much  in the ratings  up there in Chicago  nope  it seems like  we have a little  buzz going on  how long have you  been listening  Jack  I've been listening  on XM  but I also  always listen  in the house  on WCKG  since you've been on  very very good  cool  well tell your  friends about us  absolutely  I tell them all the time  but a lot of times  they get all cringed out  and they can't make it  through the virus part  through the sickness  oh really  and you're saying 
[01:29:00]  that you're starting  to see a lot of  wow stickers in Chicago  I've seen  I've seen two of them  yeah I have  two  alright  so with him  that's three people  I went to you  to make ourselves  feel better  about what's going  on in Chicago  it says on the line  starting to see  wow stickers out here  no you're starting  to see two  there's a big  difference there  Jack  I got all excited  and now  no I can't be excited  never give the number  of stickers  just say you've seen  some  yeah if it's more 
[01:29:30]  than two  that's a lot  then just go  yeah we've seen  some stickers  yeah  I'm seeing some  stickers  alright Jack  thank you  they did a sticker  stop last time  I was there  and we end with this  Chicago  stupid Robert Fetter  from the Sun Times  the Chicago Sun Times  he hates us  he's a Man Cow fan  I believe he went  to Man Cow's wedding  so I don't even know  why this guy  should be allowed  to write about  Chicago radio  he obviously  will never like  the Opie and Anthony  show  no matter what  we do  well you know 
[01:30:00]  he does the ratings  recap  and we have  openly said  look  you know  Robert Fetter  will talk to you  any morning  come on the air  faggot  stop hiding  behind your column  and call the  Opie and Anthony  show  and let's discuss  this  that's a good way  to be mature  that's a good way  to get him in  yeah  that's not too good  can't wait to see  you ride home  oh yeah  that's tame  but you know  Robert Fetter  we have said  just call the show  anytime  and we'll put you 
[01:30:30]  right through  we're not  we're not scared  of what you would  have to say  and let's discuss  this  yep  we think we're  going to be  successful in Chicago  it's too early to tell  so he does the ratings  wrap up for Chicago  sorry we haven't been  there for 12 years  and he's obsessed  with Mancow  which is a little strange  he says  Mancow's not there  he says at Q102  another station  obviously in Chicago  Mancow's replacement  an ensemble cast  of wise guys  and gals  who talk about  the day's news  saw two thirds  of Mancow's  spring share vanish  though billed 
[01:31:00]  as the morning fix  the conceptually  promising radio experiment  could prove to be  anything but a fix  that's what happened  doesn't this jackass  if he writes for radio  he should know  you can't have a show  that's been established  in a city  leave  have a replacement  come in  and just go  business as usual  not lose one point  in the ratings  people grow attached  to shows  and they leave  and then it's the job  of the replacement show  to build an audience again 
[01:31:30]  you don't just get it  automatically  and he knows that  he obviously  of course he does  you guys had to build  back up  he's a huge Mancow fan  and was pretty bummed  when WCK  Q101  decided to get rid of him  because he was a douchebag  that's pretty much it  why'd they decide  to get rid of him  I've heard  because he's impossible  to work with  because he's a douchebag  a complete  douchebag  I've heard things 
[01:32:00]  no one likes him  no one likes working  with this idiot  dare I say  he's a nutbag  Anthony's looking  for something over there  I'm stalling  I don't know  what goes on  I just wanted to  call him a  but he's not  I like when Anthony  holds his tits  I don't have  are you insane  first of all  you can't say that  oh sorry  second of all 
[01:32:30]  I am svelte  oh you're making  Al sweat down the hall  don't worry Al  we know you can't  say that on the radio  it's one of the  big seven words  is it  yes  it all started  with that word  it's the last one  I apologize  is this alum  it's right after  the big MF one  really  yeah  no  so getting to  stupid Robert Fetter  from the Chicago Sun  does he build that way  stupid Robert Fetter  and once again  I encourage the  O&A pass  to give  give Robert Fetter 
[01:33:00]  an email  and ask him  when he's coming  on the O.P. and Anthony  show  and just stop  hiding behind  his stupid column  perhaps you can  send him emails  like you sent  our own boss  why should he  get anything less  than our own boss  over at XM  Eric Logan got  that's right  so give him  a similar email  that's all  that's all we're saying  that's all we're saying  give him the same  respect  with your emails  that you gave 
[01:33:30]  our boss  Eric Logan  and I want  every email  to start off  by saying  hey nutbag  hey douche  I say  we bring it down  to third grade level  there's a lot of times  we ask the O&A pass  to kind of keep it intelligent  keep it high brow  we know we do have  a lot of very intelligent  listeners  but as far as  this assignment goes  let's go down  to third grade level  because there's no  turning this guy around  he's completely  one sided  he'll never like us 
[01:34:00]  this is what he says  about us  and maybe someone  from Chicago  could call and tell us  how long we've been  on WCKG  I believe it's only  been three  maybe four months  I think it's three months  he writes  the only morning show  doing worse  is WCKG's  latest replacement  for Howard Stern  the syndicated duo  of Greg  Opie Hughes  and Anthony Cumia  they're faring  no better than  Shane Rover French  who lasted only  seven months here  another article  in Chicago  said that  we're doing better  than Rover did 
[01:34:30]  in Chicago  but nothing to brag about  there's really  not much going on  in the ratings  no we gotta like  hit that click mark  that little mark  where it goes  dink  and goes up  and then you go  ah okay  now we're working  it takes time  the ongoing calamity  at WCKG  is costing CBS Radio  millions in advertising  revenue  prompting the  inevitable talk  of adjustments  to the station's  lineup  if not a total  overhaul  of its format  calm down  it's too early  Robert  they're gonna give us 
[01:35:00]  a little more time  in Chicago  Jesus  matter of fact  I have enough  confidence in what's  going on in Chicago  I wanna bring the  helicopter to Chicago  yeah  yeah  getting a lot of  email from Chicago  we're getting a lot  of postcards  from Chicago  I wanna fly  the helicopter  in Chicago  and dump the money  you don't wanna fly it  yeah I wanna fly it  fly in it  no I wanna fly it  too  I wanna give it a shot  that would be  exciting to see  I'd like to see  the rotors  hit the ground  hit the top  of a Walmart 
[01:35:30]  see cause I'm like  Robert Fetter  we're not gonna hide  I believe  if we go to Chicago  and I get in a helicopter  and I dump  at least 5,000  but now I'm starting  here it's gonna be  closer to 10,000  at least maybe more  and maybe other things  we could dump out  of the helicopter  anvils and washing  machines  I was gonna go  with bowling balls  okay  anvils  yeah you went  old school  I went old school  cartoon  alright  you make anvils  anymore  nobody has an anvil  where am I gonna  find an anvil  nobody's shoeing  horses  a smithy shop 
[01:36:00]  yeah  even though the  ratings aren't  showing much  of anything  I do believe  we will get  a fine crowd  that's what we do  Robert Fetter  we're not gonna hide  we'll come to  Chicago  we'll fly the  helicopter  and we'll dump  at least  can I say  $10,000  of cold hard cash  out of the  helicopter  out of the  helicopter  you've said it  and I promise you  we will have a nice  crowd that shows up  for this  I guarantee  a really nice 
[01:36:30]  crowd  one lucky guy  it's gonna be  Robert Fetter  there picking up  all the money  $10,000  that bastard  see no one  showed up  and I got  10 grand  out of it  and he does  the old  I told you  I told you  I had no  listeners  that he's  picking up  the cash  I'm starting  to think  we should go  to Chicago  and show  him a thing  or two  yeah  you know  because we  don't hide  let's do that  we don't hide  let's get WCKG  on the phone  and make that  happen 
[01:37:00]  alright  I see that  Dan  yeah we just  kept behind  we're really  behind  so there you go  we're all over  the news today  here and there  and everywhere  Frank Vincent is here  so I hear  we're gonna get him  on the show  maybe we'll talk  about some of the  things happening  in the world  today  maybe we should  talk about  David Beckham  finally we have  a hottie  in the soccer  world here  in the states  can anyone

[01:40:00]  I watch it  like every  Monday afternoon  there's no  flipping around  the channels  having that  on and  then you  pass it  if you  if you have  the remote  in one  hand  and you  pass that  you have  no  male  genitals  there's  certain  movies  you don't  pass  you don't  pass  that one  by  that  good  fellas  right  right  exactly  which is  never on  raging bull  when that's  on you're  like oh  god  that's  the  Scorsese  thing  he's got  so much 
[01:40:30]  in there  and you  have to  watch it  20 times  to see  it all  yeah  because there's  so much  happening  yes  anything  and now  of course  you were  in here  about  how long  ago  would you  say  I don't  know  March  last year  was it  March  almost a  year  yeah  almost a  year  now  some  people  might  find  this  odd  but there  was a  movie  I  hadn't  seen  ever  till  after  your  visit  and it  was  Jungle  Fever  holy  Jesus  Christ  Spike Lee  oh my  god  what a 
[01:41:00]  scene  you  have  so  Spike  says to  me  he brings  me  and he  says  I want  you to  read  this scene  this is  the scene  with  Annabella  and I  have to  beat her  up  oh  beat her  up  because  she's  going  with  a  black  guy  yeah  so  she  walks  in  the  door  and I  crack  her  and I  say  things  to her  very  very  bad  things  and  you know  I can't  say  anyone  on the  radio  but  you know  you marry  her  so  Spike  says  you're  going  to have  a  problem  because  he's  got  all  black  crew  right  so  it's  got 
[01:41:30]  to  be  a  little  uncomfortable  even  though  obviously  you're  acting  yeah  and stuff  but  it's  got  to  be  uncomfortable  to  use  that  type  of  language  so  I  said  Spike  do you  have  a  he's  doing  this  a  little  too  good 
[01:42:00]  that's  no  acting  like  that's  what  I'd  be  afraid  of  it's  like  you know  he's  really  doing  a  good  this  isn't  even  in  the  script  this  guy's  ad  living  if  I  was  in  that  situation  I  right  yeah  and  you  would  just  smack 
[01:42:30]  and  it  was  such  a  scene  where  she  just  she's  got  her  groceries  she opens  the door  it's all  peaceful  at night  right when  that door  opens  bam  you smack  her  oh it's  brutal  you know  Michael  Imperioli  played  my son  yeah  he was  kind of  in the  background  of that  scene  speaking  of the  n-word  really  fast  because  it's  in  the  paper  today  and  god  do  we  hate  saying  speaking  of  the  n-word  but  they  dump  out  on  this  portion  of  the  op  and  anthony  show  a  queen  city  councilman 
[01:43:00]  is on  a mission  to  abolish  the  n-word  abolish  it  yeah  no  I  think  if  it's  being  used  in a  way  that  has  nothing  to do  with  hate  or  anything  especially  in the  comedy  world  like  that  where  you  know  those  kind  of  taboos  should  be  taken  not  like  Michael  Richards  when  he  got  up  on  stage  and  lost  his  mind  but  you  know  that  I  think  you  should  have  free  reign  to  use  that  word  no  really  I  mean  it's  very  hard  to  throw  that  in 
[01:43:30]  the  only  comics  that  could  ever  use  that  word  as  a  black  comic  you  can't  get  no  matter  what  context  you  can  say  it  in  somebody  is  going  to  come  up  to  you  and  give  you  and  have  a  problem  Louis  CK  used  it  brilliantly  the  other  day  it  was  Patrice  O'Neill  was in  here  a black  comic  and  he  was  talking  about  Jews  and  how  the  derogatory  term  for  Jews  kike 
[01:44:00]  got  invented  and  I  don't  know  if  it's  true  or  not  but  he  said  that  at  Ellis  Island  when  the  Jewish  people  came  they  would  use  a  circle  to  represent  a  Jewish  person  which  is  something  called  a  Keuchel  right  this  was  his  explanation  I  don't  know  but  this  was  his  explanation  well  it's  Italians  WAP  yeah  that's  without  papers  really  yeah  that's  where that  came  from  see  yeah  that's  something  though  it all  comes  back  from  Ellis  Island  when  they  came  over  yeah  exactly  so  so 
[01:44:30]  if  you  allow  them  to  say  the  N  word  you  have  to  allow  them  to  say  Irish  you  know  Shanty  Irish  yeah  everything  in  any  context  that's  ridiculous  well  the  point  is  you  know  you  can't  start  banning  words  and this  councilman  should  know  that  you  can't  ban  words  first  amendment  he's  talking  about  just  walking  around  New York  city  you know  not being  able to  use the  word  if you 
[01:45:00]  are  stupid  enough  to  use  the  word  as  you  walk  around  New  York  city  so  be  it  I  think  there's  payment  enough  if you  use  the  N  word  in  but  that's  in  the  news  today  we're  just  talking  about  that  so  I  wanted  to  bring  that  to  the  table  that's  jungle  fever  right  yep  I  actually  dated  the  first  black  girl  I  ever  dated  I  didn't  know  what  to  call  her  African  American  you know  whatever  Negro  colored 
[01:45:30]  I  actually  called  her  I  said  1950  I  didn't  know  I  messed  up  I  called  her  a  colored  girl  Aunt  Jemima  you  called  that  was  the  role  play  I  got  a  little  headband  and  some  syrup  so  what  did  that  get  you  when  you  called  her  a  colored  girl  she  forgave  me  because  I  didn't  know  how  could  you  be  so  ignorant  as  to  that  term  hasn't  been  used  in  50  years  they  switched  because  that's  right  when  they  went  to  this 
[01:46:00]  is  what  you  call  black  people  it  went  from  colored  to  black  people  to  African  American  I  think  African  American  has  been  the  accepted  term  for  years  not  years  she  didn't  think  you  were  black  did  she  no  she  didn't  she  thought  I  was  Puerto  Rican  but  I'm  Hispanic  Irish  Italian  Robert  Patrick  Kelly  that  could  absolutely  be  Hispanic  he's  a  guinea  mick  she  forgave  me  I  never  went  out  with  a  colored  girl  before 
[01:46:30]  and  she  was  like  what  did  you  call  me  I  was  like  oh  but  you  know  my  grandfather  he  still  calls  the  neighbors  he's  like  the  colored  guy  I  without  a fork 
[01:47:00]  or a  knife  she  was  sucking  them  right  out  of  the  ball  that's  the  whole  claim  to  fame  bandana  and  peaches  it was  very sexy  black  girls  are  very  black  she  looked  like  she  could  run  a  marathon  like  her  that  little  small  bum  you know  that  little  small  African  booty  not  the  big  black  American  black  girl  that  little  African  small  it  looks  like  a  little  almost  like  a  12  year  old  boy  booty  you  can  rest  your  beer  on  the  back  of  her  butt  at  the 
[01:47:30]  pool  you  ever  play  slave  girl  did you  ever  get  really  crazy  with  her  what's  the  craziest  thing  you  did  with  her  as far  as  the  racial  difference  I was  talking to  Patrice  about  this  there's  a couple  types  of  black  girls  there's  the  black  girl  with  the  peaches  and  the  bandana  then  there's  the  white  girl  black  girl  which  they  went  to  college  and hung  out  with  fat  white  chicks  they're  psycho  they're 
[01:48:00]  really  nuts  because  they  want to  be  choked  and  they  cry  and  then  they  come  back  and  they  were  fat  but  now  they're  skinny  and  they  have  a  photo  of  it  and  it's  kind  of  nasty  and  you  gotta  be  careful  of  their  hair  because  they  have  the  tracks  and  my  hair  will  fall  out  real  I  he's  from  Boston  you gotta  be  really  careful  so  then  what's  the

[02:05:00]  I would grab two babies  and use them as flotation  I'd get the fattest chick  I could find  and float on her belly  out of there  well you have to get the books  so you know what movies  to watch  what movie  like what movie  well I mean  we have different categories  we have gangster movies  we have  let me see  I think we know  which ones fit in there  a movie to watch  with your girl  that's a man's movie  let me see  let me go here  western flicks  gangster flicks  we have  sports flicks 
[02:05:30]  that's not something  you watch with your girl  no  we have  I'm going here  we have  some of the little  romance  war flicks  there's no  well there's no really  chick chicks  yeah that's what I'm saying  you want to be a man  you don't want to  romance and comedy  we have chick flicks  and we say  I don't think so  oh that's what it is  I don't think so  just one page  chick flicks  but there's a lot of movies  you can watch  with your buds  I think I'm gay  I just asked him  what flick  chick flicks  and he showed you a page  I don't think so  he just showed you  a blank page  I just learned 
[02:06:00]  I just learned that thing  what are you going home  to watch  Bridges in Madison County  no  Fried Green Tomatoes  watch True Romance  oh my favorite movie  of all time  that's a good movie  people say that  that's one of my  favorite movies  that and Lonesome Dove  Lonesome Dove  that's you  I lost your name  Lonesome Dove  what is Lonesome Dove  six hour western epic  true romance  anyone with any Sicilian in him  has to watch that  and just  it's an amazing scene  it's just a great movie 
[02:06:30]  and the end of the movie  but Brad Pitt in the movie  I mean all the cameos  who played Elvis  there was  Val Kilmer  how great was that  you never see his face  and he was a star  at the time  and he took that role  you don't even get to see him  what a cool  and Brad was cool  when he played  sounds like you really  wanted to see him there Bob  easy  you know  Quentin wrote that movie  Quentin Tarantino  but he hates it  why does he hate it  because Tony Scott  Tony made it Hollywood 
[02:07:00]  and kind of shot it  a little different  you know  Quentin would shoot it  a little more  independent film  like  that was great  it was my favorite movie  Pulp Fiction's one of my  you know  Pulp Fiction's a great movie  when a guy gets pulled over  by the cops  and he's with the girl  he's got to blow with him  yeah  oh yeah  hold it  she said  you nuts  hold it  you nuts  look at it  I don't want to ever  hit a woman in my life  I'm sure that's in the book  oh my god  don't hit women  don't hit chicks  but  but  that scene  they knock your coke 
[02:07:30]  out of your hand  when the cops are coming  you smack that whore  he said to the cop  hi  that's one of those scenes  where as it's happening  the first time you watch the movie  you go  there's no way out of this  this guy is so screwed  oh yeah  he's screwed  there's no  wiping it off  there's no  that kid's a good actor  I forgot his name  the kid who played that role  well he  Pinchot  yeah  Pinchot  he was just on  Celebrity  that VH1 reality show  Surreal World 
[02:08:00]  yeah Surreal World  he was  yeah he's crying  he's crying  he got molested  and he came out  on the show  and he was crying  and flipping out  you know what you gotta do  you gotta push all that stuff down  right  like a man  a real man's man  pushes all that emotion down  what page is that  push the molestation down  push any emotion  42  you ever get any  you ever get a little misty  watching a movie or anything  Frank  occasionally  occasionally  occasionally yeah  can you remember the movie  or the scene or anything  no it's usually about  maybe about father son 
[02:08:30]  father daughter stuff  things like that  that stuff could maybe  move me a little  yeah  but I watch movies  in a very different way  I watch them  in terms of what they are  as like an artist  you watch them  I watch them more like  more like what's going on  you know  the making of it  the production of it  yeah  so the entertainment of it  goes away for me a lot  except a movie like this  where it really takes you away  or a godfather 2  that kind of a movie  where it really takes you  and you forget about the scenes  you forget about how he's cutting it 
[02:09:00]  you forget about  what they're doing with the camera  like the Chronicles of Nadia  yeah  Chronicles of Nadia  hey we're running out of show  Sopranos Frank  what can you tell us  what can you tell us  I can tell you that  it's going to premiere  April 8th  yeah  the last nine  last nine shows  this is it  huh  this is definitely it  so far  so far  alright another season  who the hell knows  there's some negotiating  going on  oh I'm sure  do that or they'll go  with the Sopranos movie  they added one more episode 
[02:09:30]  this season  they did  so we're going to do nine  and I don't know  what's going to happen  after that  we just got nominated  for Screen Actors Guild  Ensemble Award  of course you did  it's a great show  and what are they  playing it on  A&E  A&E just premiered  in syndication  now how's that  working out  how's that going to work  with all the language  I saw it  make that face again  yeah  because I just  see the lemon over there  we have to loop  every show  oh my god 
[02:10:00]  even this  whatever we do  you have to go loop  it for  the clean version  that's a great state  you replace  freaking with  right  all the other words  take out all the other words  and my character  does all that  of course  the words are funny though  and you see them  not go  bye bye  oh no  yeah we talk about that  on the show  but who doesn't have HBO  in this day and age  why do you need  the A&E version  a lot of people  a lot of people  don't have HBO  we did Torgasm  yeah  a lot of people  like now that they 
[02:10:30]  have it on DVD  they're like  wow I never got a chance  to see it  it's great  it's like weird  how many people  don't have HBO  Jimmy never watched  Jim Norton  never watched  one episode  of The Sopranos  until like last season  and then he picked up  every single season  and sat there  until blood came out  of his eyes  watching every show  he couldn't stop watching  that's the best way  to do it though  yeah you see it all  you see the whole  continuity  yeah it's the best way  to do it  I like at least watching  I get the box sets  and then at least 
[02:11:00]  watch the season before  when the new season  comes out  so you catch up  a little bit  it's going to be  a good year  you can't give us  anything  a little spoiler  a little something  to get people  chattering  yeah dude  your character  come on  your character  it's got to be  going big  big time  because last season  when he  how great was that  when he was crying  oh my god  and you were like  hey  I thought he was  comforting the guy  and he walks up  he's crying  I was like  oh my god  that was one of  the best scenes  because yeah  I thought  I thought these  two were close  he's crying  it's like maybe  you commiserate  with him 
[02:11:30]  you're just thinking  feeling for the guy  and you just  come out and go  look at this  faggot  he's just  he's crying  like a baby  like a girl  like a girl  if they can make  him cry  they can make  him do anything  right  see  that's the line  that's it  he's thinking  business wise  he just went  old school  like that  yeah  that spun my  head around  oh man  the guy  just went  through all  this crap  and you're  just thinking  hey  I want to  keep my ass  out of jail  I cry  at an extreme  home makeover 
[02:12:00]  I really do  I can't watch  the show  Frank ought to  come over there  and slap your face  I really do  I can't reach  I laugh my ass  off because I  know they're  rebuilding those  houses in the  ghetto and the  film crews and  everyone are  leaving and this  poor family has  to now defend  this fort  this fortress  that should be  a show after  the show  you don't think  the homies are  driving by like  damn look what  they just put  into our  neighborhood  they get three  floors and  everybody around  them has ranches  with bars in the 
[02:12:30]  window and they  get a jacuzzi in  the back  that's why I laugh  because I play it  out in my head  and it's a huge  commercial on TV  what's in the  house with the  flat screens and  you know and the  astronaut chair or  whatever the hell  they throw in it  they do get  ridiculous  it's like  pimp my ride  you know all those  cars are getting  you know carjaxed  them as the crew  leaves  oh my god  oh my god  this is beautiful

[02:21:30]  on XM in just a bit  Colby and Anthony  I don't know  you  Thank you. 
[02:22:00]  Thank you. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you. 
[02:23:00]  Thank you. 
[02:23:30]  Thank you. 
[02:24:00]  Thank you. 
[02:24:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:25:00]  Thank you. 
[02:25:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:26:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:26:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, he doesn't want that.  Okay.  Don't cross the family.  Whatever that means.  There you go.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, whatever that means.  Exactly.  You jackass.  Setting up camp over here.  All right, cool.  The cameras are on.  Yeah, we were talking about Vegas with Frank Vincent.  Because Anthony had a nice run.  I don't think any of that made the air.  I think we were talking about that during the commercial. 
[02:27:00]  Nah, that's a pretty good one.  You had a nice blackjack run.  Last day.  Yeah, I had a good run.  Yeah, blackjack.  Where'd you gamble?  I was at MGM.  Over at the MGM.  Did pretty good.  $25 table, $50 table?  Yeah, stay over there.  That's it.  $25.  You know, you could play for a while.  You get 15 minutes of winning.  You've got to know how to bet for the 15.  If you stay there too much longer, you're going to take the cash.  There goes your pile.  Wait, that's the way you do it?  15 minutes? 
[02:27:30]  Well, that's the way they analyze it.  When you go in a casino, if you're going to spend two or three hours, you're going to  get a good shot, 15 minutes.  So when you know you're in the middle of your good shot, you should stick it in.  Get on the clock, right?  Yeah, and just keep betting it up, betting it up, betting it up, because you're winning  hand, boom, boom, double up, double up.  Because if you win and pull back, win and pull back, you're not going to make any money.  People don't say, yeah, they say, oh, quit when you're ahead.  You quit when you start losing.  When you feel, you'll feel that change.  Right.  And that's when people try to catch up or thing that, you'll feel when the shoe changes 
[02:28:00]  on you.  Isn't that strange that you definitely feel the turn?  Yeah.  And you know it's happy, but you're like, it's a bad shoe.  Nah, come on.  It's going to turn around.  After a couple of bets, if that trend continues, get up and leave.  And the thing is, when you sit down and you don't feel it, you still chase it anyway.  Yep.  Say, well, no, it'll go.  I'll be all right.  I'll just bet.  Give me another turn.  Yeah.  Before you know it, you're like stuck 500.  The worst thing you could say is, now I've lost so many in a row, I'm due. 
[02:28:30]  I'm due.  Yeah, you're due.  You're not due.  Look at Frank.  Yeah, you're due.  You're not due.  You're due for impeding.  You're never due.  I've seen these guys, they walk up to a table, don't even sit down.  Take like a $500 chip, put it down.  Just deal me, deal me, deal me.  Right.  Boom, boom, boom.  They wind up pulling like a 16.  Yeah.  The dealer's showing a jack.  Right.  He hits, he hits a 10, he busts.  It's not playing the game, you know?  No, no.  You got to play it.  You got to be disciplined.  You got to know when to get the hell out of the table, leave. 
[02:29:00]  I only sit on third base.  I only sit next to the dealer.  Yeah.  The only place I'll play.  Because this card determines what he does.  Yeah, right.  If he's got a six and you got a six, I ain't hitting.  No, let him bust.  Let him bust.  But he could beat you, but you ain't never supposed to bust in blackjack.  Yeah.  You ain't never supposed to go over.  Mm-hmm.  So you have to lay back a little bit and take your shot down.  He's going to bust.  He's got to hit.  I've sat at some blackjack tables where when someone new comes and sits down, I'll put the 
[02:29:30]  minimum bet down.  Right.  Right.  Because I want to see what they do.  If the dealer's showing a five and they're showing a three and they hit it, boom, get  it.  I'm up.  I'm out of here.  I'm not going to sit there and lose money because some asshole, you know, I'm playing  my game and some asshole screws it up for everybody.  But no one ever talks about those guys screwing it up in your favor.  Oh, it can happen, but I've seen it happen.  Yeah.  It happens, but you can't depend on it.  You can't depend on it. 
[02:30:00]  And when it doesn't happen, you will see a pissed off table, especially if there's some  big money bets.  The high rollers that bet $5,010, they sit alone at the table.  Right.  They get their own table, them and the dealer.  They might play two hands, but there's nobody there to screw them up.  To screw them up.  It's my game.  I want to play it.  It's going to be what it is.  Like, I made a couple of pretty big-sized bets, and the people at the table were like,  what do you want me to do?  You know?  They were asking me, what do you want me to do? 
[02:30:30]  Which is nice and stuff, and I say, just don't be stupid.  Right.  Don't be stupid.  That's a good advice.  That's all?  That's great advice right there.  That's the same advice my second stepfather gave me.  Don't be stupid.  But stupid and gambling go together, because it's passion.  It's greed.  It's money.  I don't care.  I take my shot.  I'm lucky.  Yeah, you're right.  I can't even play blackjack.  I actually start to tremble when I say, I cannot sit at any table.  I can sit at roulette, and I can do a slot machine.  That's it. 
[02:31:00]  Anytime I sit at a blackjack, my hands start to shake.  Poker used to get me.  The first time I sat at a hold'em table, live, because I play online, you know, play on the  computer.  The first time I sat live at a hold'em table, I was, like, shaking.  It's exciting.  Now you're playing with real people.  It's exciting.  It's exciting.  Yeah, the adrenaline's pumping.  You know, and I'm playing at, like, a one-two table.  I'm playing nothing.  But what a pisser.  And now, you know, I go down there.  I play blackjack when I don't have enough time to play poker. 
[02:31:30]  Because when I play poker, like I said, I sat down at a table.  It was about seven o'clock at night.  Sat down.  We got in.  Sat down at the hold'em table.  I got back up to the room at 8.30 the next morning.  Sure.  So I will play.  I'll play poker.  Yeah.  All fucking night.  You got to spend a lot of time playing poker.  Most of the time, you're folding your hand.  Most of the time.  That's 90% of your game is pushing your cards in. 
[02:32:00]  Are you in a tournament, or are you just sitting at a table?  Cash game.  Just a cash game.  You sit down.  But most of the people are the same people.  They don't leave either.  Yeah.  So, you know, if somebody takes some of your chips, you wait, you get them back, or you  get them back from this guy.  You put enough time in.  You play smart.  You will walk away.  You got to know when to hold them and know when to fold.  That's it.  You ought to write a song about that.  Yeah, you ought to.  Ew.  Anthony was telling me at dinner, though, that he was sitting next to an older guy that was 
[02:32:30]  showing his cards.  He didn't know he was showing his cards.  Oh, yeah.  You got to tell that story.  Yeah, I felt a little guilty, but I'm going to take it.  If it happens, it's going to happen.  I was sitting next to an older gentleman, and he was pulling his cards way up to look  at him, and I was able to see him.  He was sitting next to me.  So I'd pull my cards and make like I was looking at mine, but I'm looking over at his.  So I'm going, all right, all right, ace-10, ace-10.  Little edge.  He's got ace-10.  He's got ace-10.  And I would just keep in my mind what he had. 
[02:33:00]  So if it got to the point where it was just me against him, I'd know what the hell he  had.  So?  But that's legal, though.  It's his responsibility, right?  He's the one that's supposed to keep his cards covered.  It's not morally right.  Well, in Casino, remember the guy was signaling?  Yeah, yeah.  And he broke his hand.  Oh, yeah.  That was a great thing.  You know the second guy that came in?  The second guy said, you want the money or you want...  Yeah.  No, that's Bob.  That's Joe Reedy.  That's the assistant director.  Oh, really?  That's Marty's assistant director.  He did a good job of looking scared shitless.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  They were signaling each other.  He got off easy.  Yeah.  The other is his buddy didn't get off so easy.  Can I ask how much money you actually...  You play from 730 to 830.  Yeah.  That's not where he wins his big money, though.  That's just for fun.  That's pretty much for fun.  You could win a couple of grand playing...  And I was playing the 510.  That's not big money?  Two grand?  Well, not if you're sitting there.  Relatively speaking, no.  He was there 12, 13 hours.  All day.  He went to... 
[02:34:00]  Where were we?  We went out to dinner and we had a half hour before we had to leave the hotel to catch a  red eye back to New York.  Within that time, he sat at the blackjack table and walked away with three grand.  Yeah, that was like...  That's a half hour.  That's money.  And that's what you were talking about.  I'm not saying $2,000 is a lot of money after 13 hours.  But when he's really trying to go for the big bucks fast, he goes blackjack or three  card.  There are times you sit down and you know you can't win.  But there are times you sit there and that's what happened. 
[02:34:30]  This.  I was getting hand after hand.  And that's when you got a strike.  And you double downs.  They're the best bets.  Double down.  And you double down again.  Double down.  Or you split.  And then you get an 11.  You could now double.  You got a stack.  Yeah, yeah.  I used to go to Foxwood with a guy actually from the North.  Do you know the North and Lafamie Georgios?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember Steven Georgios?  Yeah, yeah.  He was a good friend of mine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was a guy from North End, if you know what I'm saying.  Excellent.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah.  You know, whatever.  In Boston.  North End is like. 
[02:35:00]  It's like a little Italy down here.  Yeah.  We know.  So he used to take me to.  He used to call me up and just go, what are you doing?  And if I said nothing, he would just come over and pick me up and make me get in the  car.  And go to Foxwoods.  Like Tessio.  You had no choice.  I had to work.  Didn't anything.  Get in the car.  Come on.  Come on.  Come with me.  Come on.  He would have duct tape in one hand.  He goes, I'm duct taping you and putting you in the trunk.  Oh, you're getting in and sitting in the passenger seat.  You can enjoy it.  So I'd go.  We'd go in.  He'd check in.  He'd be 4,000, 5,000, 15 minutes in at the roulette table. 
[02:35:30]  We were sitting there one night and he asked the dealer for the guy for new dice.  And the guy wouldn't give him new dice.  He's like, no, sir.  We just got.  Crap.  He's like, I want new dice.  He goes, no, sir.  And he took the dice, threw them on the other craps table and yelled, Yahtzee.  Yahtzee.  Did they throw him out?  Yeah, they threw him out.  So he went to the, he had all these points.  So he went to the little store and used all his points on all like Q-tips and like little 
[02:36:00]  tissues.  He just bought them all.  He said, I'm buying all their freaking Q-tips.  Somebody wants Q-tips, they're not getting them.  He showed them.  Yeah.  What was he going to do?  He just lost thousands of dollars.  He bought more duct tape.  Hey, Frank is a very busy man, but we should get him to do some acting before he gets out  of here.  Little acting.  We got to kind of explain this.  We get some big time actors to help us along with this.  I mean, it would be our pleasure if Frank would play along.  Um, Steve did this.  Should we play the whole promo first?  Eh.  The promo, uh, where this comes from?  Oh yeah, this was from a promo. 
[02:36:30]  God, I keep forgetting.  Should we?  Can we find that?  We got it?  Good luck.  All right.  Uh, Steve does production for our show and he does like promos and stuff.  And he, he, he, he wrote a little something that's just god awful on so many levels.  And we weren't even going to play it on the air, but it was so bad that it took on a life  of its own.  So we're going to play it for you.  And then Anthony's got Steve's lines isolated.  All right?  Okay.  But listen to the original first.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony show presents a Wild Bill production. 
[02:37:00]  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Than and Sam show, XM202 is proud  to present a new Opie and Anthony spin-off.  A program that will surely take the radio world by storm.  Announcing Steve C. and his best friend Bill.  Starring Opie and Anthony's own Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the intern.  Who is sensible, articulate, and certainly not crazy.  Hello?  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  Swell, condo. 
[02:37:30]  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, exactly, Frank.  Yeah.  He's making that same face.  What's the reason for this?  Exactly.  Exactly.  What is the reason?  To justify a paycheck, I don't know.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  He handed that in, and we're like, there's no way we can play this on the air.  This stinks.  And then I think it was Jim who said, no, we have to play it.  Because it stinks.  Because it stinks.  And now it just has taken on a life of its own.  We play the clips all the time.  We've isolated Steve's acting clips and really chewed them apart and critiqued this. 
[02:38:30]  Okay.  Now, he's supposed to be sorry that this guy's parents have passed away.  And here's how he emotes that feeling.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It's so nothing, isn't it?  It's just...  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  And then he asks...  How'd your parents die?  And it's the same inflection as just... 
[02:39:00]  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  He's got a good range.  What a range, right?  What a range.  He's got acting range.  You could hold his acting range between your thumb and forefinger.  He says it like, pass the piece.  Can you pass the piece?  Pass the piece.  How'd your parents die?  Pass the piece.  And then here he gets a little dynamic.  What are you doing in my house?  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing in my house?  Hey, house.  And then here's the...  Like, the kind of... 
[02:39:30]  Like, I'll take care of this.  Just...  Here he goes.  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  No.  Yeah, he's good.  You think Scorsese's going to be calling or what?  I don't think so.  Okay, yeah.  His acting gives me douche shivers.  Marvin Scorsese.  Marvin.  So, what do you want to do?  You want to do these?  I would love to get your rendition of some of these lines.  Anthony, you're the director. 
[02:40:00]  Like, set up the scene again.  Who's going to play opposite me?  No, there's no...  I'll just give you that.  It's like, almost like you're looping.  It's just, you know, I'll give you the little...  Can I read them?  Well, you want to just play them and I'll do it.  I think it's easy.  We'll just play them.  Like, this is...  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  But why is he saying that again?  Because...  Set up the scene.  Here we go.  Okay.  This young boy...  Walked in his house.  ...had walked in his house and informed him that his parents are dead.  Okay.  So, you know, the guy's feeling a little badly now that he treated him kind of poorly. 
[02:40:30]  Why don't he play the other guy?  Okay.  I'll do it as a...  Oh, my God.  Joe Pesci.  What the hell are you doing?  What the hell are you doing?  Come in.  So, he says to him, what are you doing in my house?  My parents died.  Oh, see?  That was good.  See?  What are you doing in my house?  Your parents died?  Yeah, they're fucking dead.  Dead.  They said dead.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  Not me?  No, not you.  Your parents died?  Yeah.  That's terrible. 
[02:41:00]  I'm sorry.  Oh, thank you.  You're a nice guy.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Holy shit.  What the fuck kind of people are you?  Well, you just can't bust in my house like this.  The fucking Jesus Christ.  I fucking hit a deer.  My mother's dead.  You fucking...  I don't care if your mother's dead.  This is my house.  You can't walk in my house.  The fuck?  Who put a crease in your fucking sleeve, you cocksucking mother?  Take a fucking hike.  All right, I'm out of here.  Go ahead.  Get out of here.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Here.  Now, now, someone else walks in.  Someone else is walking in, and they want to get involved.  Now, Frank, you got to tell them, no, look, you stay in there. 
[02:41:30]  I'll handle it.  Okay.  So, I'll walk in.  Okay.  So, get the fuck out of my house.  All right.  Relax.  Is there something maybe...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Mind your fucking business, huh?  I'll take care of this.  Yeah, mind your fucking business, you hoopty hoop, you fucker.  Who's this guy?  I don't know.  This cocksucker comes out of nowhere.  Who the fucking is he, huh?  And you're still here.  I'm sorry.  Well, when the fuck you going?  I'm fucking going right now, you cock...  All right.  I'm fine.  Fine.  Fine.  And take your coffee with you.  All right.  You fucking...  What?  You fucking cocksucking fucking...  Corksucking... 
[02:42:00]  See, that's how it's done.  Not like this.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  What are you doing in my house?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  See?  Hey.  The different, the dynamic, the range.  It's the director.  I love when he went...  Hey.  No, oh, whoa.  No, no, no.  Yeah, I know.  Like, whoa, whoa, hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It was almost like, wait a minute.  In real life, I fucked something up.  You can't...  And he's calling me out on it.  You can't write, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, three times. 
[02:42:30]  No, no.  No writer in the world is going to go, say, whoa, whoa, three times.  Oh, hey, a guy's going to see...  He's going to go...  He's going to see, hey, who are you?  And then he's going to go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Are you interrupting me?  Absolutely.  Hey, the guy that did that fun acting is on the phone.  It's Steve C., everybody.  Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Morning, boys.  What's the matter, Steve?  Oh, I was so moving.  Did you get to hear Frank Vincent doing some of your lines?  Yeah, I just heard it. 
[02:43:00]  I just heard it.  It was amazing.  It was like...  Really?  It was like a real person really reacting to a situation as opposed to a mannequin with  some type of recording voice inside of it.  You know, for the longest time, I thought that there was no way that those lines could have  been delivered properly.  And I have been proven wrong.  And that was it.  Who would...  Would you have written, whoa, whoa, whoa?  Of course not.  Steve, my GPS has better acting skills than you. 
[02:43:30]  There ain't left one mile.  Thanks, Bob.  I appreciate it.  So I was telling Frank Vincent earlier that you guys are out there for the Porn Awards,  Steve.  Yeah.  He's in Vegas there, Frank.  Are you still out there?  Yeah.  I'm at the Mandalay Bay right now.  Are you behaving?  Are you behaving?  Are you looking at them grabbing stuff?  You know what?  It's interesting with the Porn Awards.  I mean, like Hot Movies sent us out here.  You know, it was all...  It's all really cool.  And, you know, by the way, Hot Movies has a huge presence out here. 
[02:44:00]  It's not a long story, is it?  So are you grabbing anything?  Come on.  Let's get right to it, son.  He wanted a little dirt, and he starts going to do a huge explanation about...  Well, let me explain to you the backside.  He doesn't want subtext, you ask.  He gave me a ticket, and they gave me a hotel room.  Who gives a fuck?  Are you grabbing anything, kid?  What I did...  I did speak for you. 
[02:44:30]  You're in Vegas, kid.  Grab something.  All right, nice talking to you, Steve.  Been nice.  Just trying to say how great the sponsor Hot Movies.com is.  Oh.  And Frank Vincent's like, yeah, whatever.  I was about to say, we made the first round through the Adult Expo yesterday.  And it's always interesting to see, you know, all the new faces and some of the old, old  haggard faces.  And we talked to...  I talked to a young lady.  At sports.  And she...  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, then what happened?  She loves being slapped in the face, and she snorts cum.  She cum?  What?  She came or she cum?  No, she snorts it?  She snorts it, Frank.  She snorts cum like a pilot.  Oh, that's good.  Snorts cum.  Well, I think my car is here.  Jesus.  Yeah, Frank wants a career after he's leaving the O.P. and Anthony show.  Does the cum have echinacea in it?  Why is she snorting cum?  She's into all this extreme stuff. 
[02:45:30]  And apparently she likes to get her hair pulled and dragged down the steps.  Black white girl.  Yeah, you know what's going on here.  They're just running out of things to do in porn.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What else can we do here?  We've done it all.  We can snort cum.  Holy shit.  That is just fun.  That makes me gag.  Imagine your sinuses after that.  I know.  It's like, fuck, ugh.  Like extra boogers up your nose.  Can they get pregnant from that?  I don't think so.  It's safe sex.  I guess.  I guess.  Doesn't do much for the guy. 
[02:46:00]  I did not have sex with that woman.  Steve.  I've never.  Steve.  So the guy, does he do it on a mirror?  That's what I call a nose job.  All right.  Nice tiger.  Wow.  Shot him?  I did that on purpose.  I ran him over.  All right, good.  Steve, does she do it on a mirror with like a dollar bill?  Yeah.  Apparently, like, she'll take a load to the face.  And then scoop it all off.  Slap it down on a table.  And then snort it.  At least that's through. 
[02:46:30]  That's the best way I think I could explain it after her broken English explanation.  Because she's hardcore.  She's German.  And she should be.  You will come on my face.  I don't want you snorting that shit.  I don't care what you had to do in prison.  Now, I don't want to see you with that shit up your nose.  Please come.  I want you to come on my face.  I want to snort your.  I want to snort your children in my nose.  Drop your load over here.  Drop your load on my face. 
[02:47:00]  That was the creepiest thing.  I just made eye contact with Frank when he said that.  And I was like, okay, whatever.  He really is intimidating.  All right, whatever you want.  Yeah?  All right, man.  Just don't hurt my family.  I'll snort whatever you want me to snort.  Oh, Bobby.  I got to tell you.  Steve, what else is going on out there in Vegas?  Oh, well, there's the wonderful trips to the gay section of the Adult Expo that Jimmy and I do every year.  And we make the first round. 
[02:47:30]  You might want to explain that because we got a man's man in studio here.  You might want to explain that a little further.  I apologize.  Gay porn?  Gay porn?  Yeah, they go into that section.  Boy on boy?  Frank, there's a whole section of this.  Swing both ways, boys and men.  Why'd they send you there, Steve?  Because apparently it's very funny when my cohort, Jim, asks these gay young men what kind of male pornography I would be best suited for. 
[02:48:00]  And you get their reactions on that video.  And it's just, we go up to these guys.  The word you're looking for, accurate?  Yeah, exactly.  He uses apparently a lot.  Yeah.  To give you a visual, Steve's like a bear.  Oh, he is?  Yeah, a big bear guy.  Did I meet him when I was here last night?  You probably did, probably.  He sounds like he's a thin guy.  They type in, if you do a Google search on burly bear.  He'll come up. 
[02:48:30]  Well, yeah, he'll come up.  That's pretty accurate.  He'll come up.  Men just like him, which is hairy bellies.  Why not?  Lying tummy to tummy.  Oh, boy.  Belly to belly.  All right, so then what happened?  Yeah, what happened in the gay section, Steve?  Well, we talked to, the first couple guys we talked to were cross-dressers, and we found  out that I would be best suited for tranny sex porn, so at least by those guys. 
[02:49:00]  You know, we're looking for that one killer line.  I don't know if we've hit upon this year's grr yet.  Yeah.  I don't know if we hit it, but it's just, it's so uncomfortable, because Jimmy's making  these guys pinch me and touch me, and these short little guys in speedos and sandals.  What, midgets?  You sound like you hate it.  I got to tell you, you either really love your job, or you're gay.  Yeah.  Definitely on the suspicion.  That's an awesome observation. 
[02:49:30]  I hope we're really fucking, we're really floating over everything, or we just cut right  to it.  Either you love your job, or you are a homo fag.  I can safely say, I'm not gay, so I must really love what I do for a living.  All right.  Let me ask you a question.  What makes you, like, viable for tranny sex?  Do you, like, shave one little patch on your asshole, like this little, like a little,  like a, like a, like a, like a, like a clearing?  The people that have seen you in person, Steve, would never say that you're made out for tranny 
[02:50:00]  sex.  Yeah.  What makes you, what makes you viable for that?  Bobby, I don't know.  Keep in mind that this, this remark was coming from a six, six and a half foot tall man dressed  in stiletto heels, a big bouffant wig.  You know all the terminology real good.  Did you go home with him?  Yeah.  No, it wasn't.  How do you, how do you know bouffant and stiletto heels?  Just rolls off your tongue.  Bouffant wig.  How do you know a wig is bouffant?  I don't know. 
[02:50:30]  How do you know the word fucking bouffant?  I've never, I can say this as a man, as a guy man.  Yeah.  I've never said bouffant in my life.  Good old bouffant.  I probably would use it wrong too, for all I know.  I'm, I'm, I'm really not sure what that word is.  This kid's under suspicion.  I got no idea.  It's kid's under suspicion.  Kid's under suspicion.  This is a great CD name right there.  Don't give him any secrets.  No.  Don't let him know anything personal.  I think you'll fold up the questioning. 
[02:51:00]  He'll fucking bury you.  He's killing as well.  He's under suspicion.  Holy shit.  Hey, Steve, everyone wants to know the name of the porn star that snorts the cum.  Annette Schwartz.  Annette Schwartz.  Annette Schwartz.  That's a porno name?  Alias Sneezy.  Nice.  We finally found a porn chick that has a non-sexy name.  That is the worst porno name I've ever heard.  AKA Sniffles.  What happened to Mercedes in Savannah? 
[02:51:30]  Schwartz.  That sounds like a CPA's secretary.  So you'll snort a little cum.  What's the difference?  She's from Germany.  Schwartz snorts.  It's wonderful.  Wait till you see Schwartz snorts.  You snort cum.  Schwartz.  Schwartz.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There she is, Annette Schwartz.  Oh, you got her picture?  Don't she look like Jerry Seinfeld?  She's definitely a walker.  She almost looks like, what's her name, Johansson?  Scarlett Johansson from here.  She's a Schwartz.  A little bit.  That's a Schwartz. 
[02:52:00]  That's a Schwartz.  But it's not like she's a beat-up, bruised skank.  Or maybe she isn't wearing a lot of makeup.  But half of these girls, half of them have some kind of weird, horrible child abuse story in their background.  Are you kidding, Steve?  Are you kidding, Steve?  Wow, really?  Holy shit.  I would think they'd be brought up in the best of homes.  Catholic school.  Right.  Two parents.  Never divorced.  Relationship with their parents.  Yeah.  In Connecticut.  Ivy League college.  She was raped when she was young.  Big backyard with dogs. 
[02:52:30]  Father was hitting her with the hammer.  Right.  I didn't think one of these girls had an uncle's beard with whiskey breath rubbing against her cheek at night.  God forbid her mother made her eat her snatch out.  Or we could get right to the point.  We were, you know, we're trying to be subtle and beat around the bush a little.  Beat around the bush.  Speaking about beating around the bush.  Bobby, why don't you just talk about dad and the bush.  And the bush.  Well, someone wants to know if we'll come make your nose bleed. 
[02:53:00]  Steve?  Hey, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Steve, just come make your nose bleed.  Why not?  Why not?  Steve, you sound like you got a cold.  Why not?  Steve, you all right?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Come, it doesn't make your nose bleed.  I mean, no.  Pump some almost glue up your snout.  Holy shit, this is funny.  So, Steve.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  So, Steve.  So, what do you cut into cum to make it last longer, by the way?  Yeah, what do you cut it?  What's the street fucking value of like an ounce of cum?  What's that going on?  What's the street rate?  What's that like?  How do you get more bang for your buck?  What are you cutting it with?  She definitely looked too good to be snorting cum.  Yes, you don't need that.  She didn't have to go there.  No, she's very cute.  And the point I was trying to make was not the obvious one.  Yes, some of these girls are child abuse victims.  But the other half that I talked to were like grad students and decided they could make a ton of money if they did porn for a while. 
[02:54:00]  And so they're doing, you know, gangbang pornography.  For a while.  And they're completely comfortable with it.  And they're healthy.  No psychological problem.  Oh, no, no.  Nothing at all.  They're all going to jump into the real estate biz, right?  As soon as they're done with porn.  And believe me, none of that shit will resurface when they want to go into politics or whatever it is later on.  YouTube and MySpace.  Yeah, with all the outlets that are on the internet now, it'll never show up.  Hard five guys banging her in the ass. 
[02:54:30]  You just had 80,000 people Google snort cum.  I was just working my way through school.  What's the problem?  Sucking dicks.  That's it.  Who hasn't?  I snorted a little load.  Yeah, who hasn't?  Somebody told me that it cures a fucking hangover.  Right.  So I snorted a fucking goober at my nose.  But my nose was bleeding once.  Yeah.  I did a little too much cum last night.  Collects a fucking diploma and just swallows it down to her tongue.  Oh, boy.  Look what I could do. 
[02:55:00]  She swallows it down to her little ribbon.  Steve, anything else from Vegas?  That's it.  We're going in for round two today.  And, you know, Jimmy is a hard one to keep track.  He sounds like his nose is stuck.  He did it before.  He did it when he first started.  I'm telling you.  It sounds like he snorting cum as he speaks to us.  You got a little stuffy.  You got any patting, any shit, man?  Steve, you're under suspicion.  You're holding?  You shouldn't be snoring during the snow call.  You're holding a little corner?  You got a little corner, brother? 
[02:55:30]  He's going to be a little corner.  Steve's selling cum in Jersey on a corner.  He's selling cum in his cul-de-sac like weeds.  Little boxes.  So, Steve.  Weeds is a great show, by the way.  It's a great show.  I just got turned on to that recently.  It was a great show.  So, Steve, you and Jimmy are going to head over there.  And what are you looking for today?  More gay guys.  That was the best.  You said that. 
[02:56:00]  Could you say that any happier?  More gay guys.  You're the best straight lines, this kid.  He's kind of skipping his step today.  He's been bummed out this whole conversation.  You say, what are you doing tomorrow?  More gay guys.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Why bullshit at this point?  Right.  Right, right.  Exactly.  He's not under suspicion no more.  We know.  I like it.  He's an honest man.  Who's the talk of the porn convention?  Who's the talk of the porn convention?  Cum snorter as you snort again.  Jesus.  You're not helping your case here. 
[02:56:30]  Cum snorter was really a diamond in the rough.  The one that I was supposed to talk to you is a diamond in the rough.  He calls her a diamond in the rough.  You'll never say that sentence again in your life.  Bouffant.  Yeah.  Diamond.  No, a diamond in the rough.  Cum snorter was a diamond in the rough.  Wow.  So who's any more talk of the convention there?  What do you got?  There's just a lot more mainstream people.  Like Jenna's here with Tito Ortiz, I think. 
[02:57:00]  Tito Ortiz is at the porn awards.  Yeah, they're dating.  It's an ultimate fighter.  They're dating.  Are they dating?  Yeah, Tito and Jenna.  That's why he lost his last fight.  No shit.  Yeah, Chuck, I think, is single.  Chuck's an animal.  Chuck's dating the chick who snorts cum.  Chuck Liddell.  Oh, yeah.  He pounds cum up a nose with his fist.  That guy is a vicious animal.  He's badass.  Are you wrestlers?  Wrestlers?  UFC.  Ultimate's fighting.  The MMA.  A man's man sport, they're friends.  They go with the girls. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, apparently, they're the only ones that can take a punch.  How the fuck do you get past her history?  That's a...  Wow.  About Jenna?  Yeah.  Jenna James.  Yeah, she's like the biggest star, right?  Yeah.  But she's been like...  She's not even...  I mean, she's...  What?  Yeah, she's fucking taking in the ass.  How many years have to go by before you take 18 cocks in the ass at one shot, before you  go, ah, there's one to take home to mom.  Yeah, how do you...  Yeah, you're right.  How do you deal with that?  How do you deal with her fucking just jamming some dude's cock in the back of her throat? 
[02:58:00]  And then there's one in the ass.  We had a guy in the...  Double penetration.  And the club one time said, shit, I brought over there.  She said, yeah, 20,000 miles of cock, she said, from here to fucking Las Vegas, I'm  back six times.  That's how much cock she's had.  You figure that out.  Wow.  That is a lot of cock.  That's one way to measure cock.  That's the funny plot of it. 
[02:58:30]  That was great.  That was back when cock was cheap per gallon.  Right, right, right.  There's no black cock around fucking it up.  Just one cock.  No rubbers, no rubbers.  No, no rubbers.  Rubbers, what?  I'm a kid.  So, yeah, so he's dating...  I can't believe that either.  How do you get over fucking your chick blowing dudes for money?  How do you leave to go to the gym to train?  You've got to have a lot of trust.  I think you take it and you watch it, do your friends.  Really?  I don't know.  Maybe that's what he's into. 
[02:59:00]  He must be watching the movies.  I've done that before.  Who's going to fuck Tito Ortiz's girl, though?  Yeah, right, right.  Chuck Liddell.  Chuck Liddell, yeah.  That's true.  Chuck Liddell in front of him and hold his hair.  Bash his elbow into his nose a few times and watch Cums shoot out.  That and Kimbo Slice.  You ever see Kimbo Slice?  No.  Google Kimbo Slice.  You want to see the baddest guy on the planet Earth.  If I'm Googling, it's not going to be a guy.  It's not wasting my time.  Wait until he comes to the UFC.  Chuck Liddell.  Kimbo Slice fights guys in parking lots. 
[02:59:30]  He gets out of a car and just beats the shit out of guys.  Oh, that's good.  There's actually a 30 count.  Criminal.  There's not a 10 count.  It's a 30 count.  A 30 count.  And if the guy hit 20 and he tried to pick him up, he goes, no, back off.  21.  22.  23.  And you think this guy can beat up Chuck?  The only guy that's ever beat Kimbo Slice is a white guy from Boston.  A white cop.  One dude.  Was he armed at the time?  Pulled his gun?  I think he'd just take a punch in the face and wore out the fucking black dude.  He has male patent baldness.  He's bald. 
[03:00:00]  But he has the sides like a monk.  And it connects to this big Amish beard.  He's a big, huge black guy from prison.  He gets out of his office is a Cadillac.  He just, as soon as the fight, he just pops out.  How do you find out about this guy?  All right, please.  I'm watching a video on Google.  Oh, are they showing him kicking ass?  Yeah.  He fights one guy that looks like Patrice.  He doesn't look like he's in shape.  Nah, he's out of prison.  He's prison shape.  Ah, he's in prison shape.  Kimbo Slice.  What a great name.  White guy?  No, no, no, no.  Kimbo?  No, no.  Black guy.  Kimbo Prison?  That's like a Mr. T thing happening. 
[03:00:30]  Stupid.  Yeah.  Mr. T.  Without the mohawk.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's a psycho.  Yeah.  He's not.  He'll fight more than one guy.  He'll fight one guy, knock him out, and then just, you, let's go.  These are the guys that fight in the cage?  Yeah.  No, this guy fights in parking lots and like lumber yards.  What is he?  Just like, look, here he is right here.  Yeah.  Is that what he's?  Wow.  This is the fight he lost.  The white guy.  He lost to a white guy.  Man.  Kimbo Slice.  Which one is where?  Where is he?  Why is there a crowd of five guys around these two? 
[03:01:00]  No, because they stopped the fight.  Stop the fight.  Yeah, this is like backyard.  This is underground.  There's some fighting that's going on.  Who are these guys that are getting involved?  Those are black guys.  They're friends of his.  And the white guys are friends of the white guy.  And they're cheering him up.  Oh, look at him.  That's him.  Oh, my God.  He's pummeling that white guy.  Yeah.  Don't they go to jail for that?  The white guy kicks him off.  Yeah.  This is all illegal, man.  Oh, this is just somewhere like, you know.  Yeah.  This is like in like a gym.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's bad.  Like camera work and everything.  Oh, yeah.  It's awful.  This is like real fight club.  They're just bare knuckle.  This is a real fight club. 
[03:01:30]  Exactly.  How long did you find out about this?  That white guy's pretty big, though.  I love the fighting, dude.  That white guy looks like any bar in Boston.  You'd find him in his car in someone's attic.  He's a cop.  He's got in trouble.  He's a cop from Boston.  Southside.  Right.  Yeah.  He's an Irish cop.  Yeah.  Irish cop from Boston.  The only guy to ever beat this guy.  Tough guy.  Southie fucking bleeder.  He's a tough guy.  He does.  He bleeds.  You're right.  He bleeds.  He bleeds all over the black guy.  It doesn't matter.  Departed.  The movie Departed. 
[03:02:00]  They're all Southside cops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy's a badass.  Kimball Slice.  That's what I want to do for a living.  What?  Fight?  Fight.  Beat people up.  Isn't that a great living?  Someone's saying that this guy punched a guy's fucking eye out.  Yeah.  That's the guy's...  Yeah.  Punched it out of his head.  How?  Dude, your eye can be punched out.  I just...  Oh, so you just hit it just right on the side and...  You made me pop your fucking eye out?  With the vice.  Frank goes.  Oh, that was great. 
[03:02:30]  Frank lit up.  He goes, with the vice.  He goes, with the vice.  Yeah, I know.  Addy old days.  That was a good scene.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  That kid's a good kid, that stunt kid.  Steve, unless you got something else, we're going to let you go there.  That's a good kid.  I'm going to put your head on the vice.  All right.  Let's say goodbye to Steve.  He's in Vegas with Jim Norton for the Porn Awards and at the Porn Convention later today  with Gay Guys.  Bye, Buffon.  Steve, keep your...  Your phone call was sponsored by HotMovies.com.  Yep.  Absolutely.  Keep your boots on, Steve.  Take everything else off. 
[03:03:00]  All right, Steve.  Take it easy.  Bring some nose spray with you.  We'll see you on Monday.  All right.  I'll see you on Monday.  Tim on Long Island.  Tim.  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Hey, man.  This guy, Kimbo Slice, is a bad motherfucker, but he beat up a guy on the street, but he  didn't get his ass kicked in UFC.  He's got no fighting skills other than a classic street brawler.  He's like Tank Abbott.  Yeah, you're probably right.  He kind of looks like the old-time boxers.  What would you think about him and Chuck Liddell? 
[03:03:30]  Chuck Liddell would whip his ass.  Chuck Liddell would whip his ass.  Chuck Liddell would go to school.  All right, check it out, though.  This guy, if Chuck Liddell fought him in the streets, this guy would beat the shit out  of Chuck Liddell.  No, he wouldn't.  No, he wouldn't.  You don't have to get mad like you're his manager, his brother.  I'm just saying.  It's an opinion.  Jesus.  Settle down.  Well, I'm telling you to settle down.  I'm relaxed.  All right, you were.  You're getting mad at me over fucking Kimbo Slice.  I don't give a shit.  I like Chuck Liddell better.  I'm with you.  This guy walks up to me on the street.  He kicks my fucking ass.  No doubt.  This guy's a big Kimbo.  Kimbo.  He's a bad motherfucker.  Right. 
[03:04:00]  He walks up to somebody who's a trained fighter.  Right.  This trained fighter is going to kick his ass because there's no rules.  You know, he can choke him.  He can bare knock me.  Maybe you're right.  Maybe you're right.  Maybe you're right.  I think Chuck Liddell, he has long arms, and he's got fucking bowling balls on the end  of him.  He's a bad, I mean, his punches are sick.  I've seen Chuck have guys on the ground.  They're on the mat, and he's punching him in the face, and he could definitely finish  the job.  He stops, backs up, and lets the guy get back up just so he can fucking punch him off. 
[03:04:30]  He doesn't want to roll around.  Chuck doesn't like to be on the ground.  No, no.  He's not a grappler.  He's unbelievable.  He doesn't want to kill him.  Randy Couture is coming back, too, by the way.  He just announced it last night.  He's going after the heavyweight belt.  But they're bringing in these guys now, because there's a lot of money in the UFC, they're  bringing in the guys from Japan now.  So you're going to see these guys that only fight in Japan at the Tokyo Dome in front of  $80,000 for a lot of money.  Now that there's money in the UFC, you're going to see the baddest motherfuckers. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, because now it's getting very popular, so they're getting more money, and it's not  just these guys that are coming in and they're slugging it out.  But what are they?  Now, I noticed a lot of the American guys, and even some of the Brazilian guys, they used  to be very exclusive to what they did.  There was a grappler.  There were the punchers, the kickboxers.  But now they all kind of incorporated it into each other.  What are they doing in Japan?  Are they still kind of...  Well, Japan, they'll fight for two hours.  Like, Gracie had a two and a half hour fight.  He got his ass beat, but there's no three rounds, five rounds. 
[03:05:30]  That's all American shit.  Just monsters.  Back in the day, yeah, they used to fight.  Fight to the end.  K-1, you fight, you win, you fight again.  You win, you go on.  You keep going until the last fight.  You're fighting three times.  Wow.  Three or four times.  So these guys...  Brutal.  These guys, these Japanese guys, there's some guys over there that are just badasses.  They're going to come over and...  Are they Japanese or American?  Some of them are Japanese, but they're American, too.  A lot of Americans fight over there because there's money.  There was no money to fight here.  Now that they're selling out fucking the MGM.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The next time I come, I'll bring my son. 
[03:06:00]  He's a Brazilian fighter.  He's got ten belts.  He's fought already.  Really?  He went to Brazil, came in second.  In Brazil?  And he's a stuntman now.  He works in films.  Did you see Departed?  Yeah.  Did you see the scene where the guy's in the vault and he gets all shot up?  Oh, yeah.  That's him.  That's your son?  That's my...  Yeah.  How cool is that?  Yeah, he's good.  And he knows all about this shit.  I don't know anything about it, but he knows all these guys.  Back in the day, you had a fight.  You fought.  You know, you rolled around somebody, you know, you punched until somebody got a headlock  and then, you know, now it's jiu-jitsu and a leg and an armbar and a rear naked choke. 
[03:06:30]  That's just the beginning, right?  Let's go to Sherry in Vegas.  Sherry.  Hey, it's actually Kerry, but hey.  Oh, all right.  Bob, I got a question for you.  Six and a half inches.  What exactly is a male patent baldness?  Oh, it's patented.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's go.  You don't have to explain.  Ryan in Indiana.  Ryan.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[03:07:00]  Hey.  I was going to say, I had my eye popped out of socket one time in a fight.  Really?  I'll tell you what, man.  It's the weirdest fucking thing to watch your eye.  I was drunk off my ass, New Year's Eve, in the hospital, got hit in the eye so hard,  my eye socket cracked.  And I was in the hospital and I sneezed.  And all the blood was all clotted up in my nose.  Holy shit.  How cute, man.  All the blood was clogged up in my nose.  And my eye just popped right out of socket. 
[03:07:30]  My whole world just went, boom.  Holy shit, you sneezed your eye out.  You had to be there.  Oh, what a night.  Wait, was it still a catch, though, just kind of hanging?  Do what?  Did it pop out exactly at midnight?  His eye hit the floor.  Dick Clark gave the countdown.  Was it hanging?  It can hang out of your eye.  It's got to hang.  It's held on by the optic nerve.  Was it hanging out of your head?  Yeah, it's hanging out of my head, rubbing along my face.  Could you see your cheek? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, could you pick it up and look around like a periscope behind your head?  That's what I would have done.  That would be fun.  Huh?  Everything stretched.  Like, when it happened, everything just elongated.  Oh, wow.  That is freaky.  I have no idea.  So you were looking straight, and then one eye was looking at your feet.  The weirdest, the most fucked up thing, the guy that did it was my best friend.  Of course he was.  Who was going to do it?  A stranger?  A couple Irish guys? 
[03:08:30]  Are we from Vegas?  How's your sight now?  Oh, my sight's fine now.  I get a...  They popped it back in?  Yeah, they popped it in in the hospital, but I got this permanent crack in my eye socket.  So now all my nasal fluids and stuff go underneath my eye and come out my eyelid.  Wait, wait, wait.  If you have a cold, you'll get snot coming out of your eye socket?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  So if you snort cum, it comes out of your eye?  Yeah.  Let's get back to it. 
[03:09:00]  All right, wow.  Did you ever see the magician that does something, but it puts something in his nose and it comes out of his eye?  Yeah, yeah.  That's probably what happens.  Yeah, it's like connected.  It's connected in the sign.  It comes right out of...  He pulls his eye down and the shit comes out of a coin or something.  Some people do that with...  Sometimes they'll drink milk or snort milk and then squirt it out.  Right, right, right.  Let him have him on, I think, or something like that.  Let's go to Jonah in Jersey.  Jonah.  Hey, how you guys doing?  What's up, man?  Just wanted to explain briefly the reason an eye can fall out in a fight. 
[03:09:30]  The round bone in your skull that basically goes around your eye is called your orbit.  If you take a shot hard enough that shatters that orbit, your eye will fall out of your head.  I did security and executive protection for about 10 years, and I've seen it multiple times.  How far can it actually come out of your head?  It basically comes out the length of the optic nerve, so it can come out.  A couple inches.  Wow.  I know they've done eye surgeries, I've heard of, where they take the eye out and kind of put it on your cheek to do some surgery. 
[03:10:00]  You will be able to continue to see out of the eye as it's hanging out.  I got kicked in the face right here.  It doesn't surprise me.  Hey, just real quick, guys.  Huh?  Just real quick, guys.  The other thing I wanted to say, you guys are talking about UFC fighters versus a street brawl.  So I absolutely think like a Chuck Liddell would destroy a normal guy, but what they don't take into account is if you start grappling with a guy on the ground, what happens is his six friends come over and stomp your face in. 
[03:10:30]  Well, that's a street fight.  Yeah, we're talking legitimate like two guys, though.  Not, you know, six guys coming over.  And I've seen some of those guys where they tie you up and you don't know what happens.  You're watching the fight and all of a sudden they go, whoa, I'm out.  He was fine a second ago.  He gets his arm and leg wrapped where this guy is like, okay, I could twitch and snap your arm.  And the guy will tap right out.  That happened in UFC 2, Hoist Gracie.  Yep.  The guy, Hoist was on the back of his neck with his feet in the air. 
[03:11:00]  The guy had him by the gi and was about to just punch him in the face.  The guy went and he just tapped out.  Hello!  Because he got his other arm and he snapped the bone.  And the ref back then didn't know about Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, so they didn't know what was going on.  They didn't know about...  I didn't see him.  Hit him?  The guy's going like this and then he's like...  He's just slamming...  And they're like, all right, knock it off.  Now you see them when they break up a fight, when they're looking for...  They actually tackle the other guy. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got to drag him off of him.  Believe it or not, there's more than one.  Matt in Arizona.  Matt.  Hey, boys.  No.  Growing up, my buddy was a dishwasher.  Got a little crazy in the kitchen.  One of the guys threw a dish at him, hit him in the head, popped his eye out.  They took him to the hospital, back then what they did is they put this rubber sealant  underneath the skin, so for his life now, he has to watch out when he stresses, i.e.  when he takes a shit, he can't get too crazy because his eye will actually have an issue 
[03:12:00]  and pop out.  Imagine you're trying to push one out and your eye fucking pops out, falls in the toilet.  Don't flush.  Don't flush.  You're going to wash your eye off?  You're just looking at a piece of your shit.  What the hell happened?  Looking at it.  Looking at it.  They're looking right at it.  That is fucked up.  What the hell happened?  They shit my eye out.  He's shitting his falls and hits the tip of your dick and plops him in the toilet.  Oh, god damn.  Let's go to Alabama.  Kevin. 
[03:12:30]  Alabama.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, can you know, to the casual listener, Big Bad Bob Kelly sounds like a real man's  man, but all you got to do is put a video of a midget getting engaged and he'll cry like  a fucking baby.  Yeah.  There you go.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thanks for bringing it up.  Frank, Frank, don't let this guy fool you.  He's a pussy.  I did.  I already admitted that I cry at fucking...  Yeah, but this guy is the worst.  I am a pussy.  He watches all his...  We were on TV and cry.  We were watching a show.  Cry midgets.  No, midgets make you cry.  We were watching a show about midgets and there was... 
[03:13:00]  It was a whole show.  This woman was...  She was about two feet tall.  Yeah.  And she had like no bones in her fingers.  No neck.  No neck, but...  I'm sorry for that.  She was the type of midget...  She had a helium voice.  She would really talk like this and it was like she was a teacher and...  And she was just, you know, trying to get somebody I love and she had a boyfriend who  was also a midget.  No, he was normal size.  He was a little...  He was retarded.  He was a little short.  They both needed to school to get the average guy. 
[03:13:30]  Maybe the tears in your eyes made him look taller.  There was a redhead.  This faggot.  Let me tell you what he does.  He goes...  He's watching.  The fiancee comes over and gives this little midget girl a ring.  Very small ring.  An engagement ring.  And she goes...  Her arms were so short, she wanted to put her hands over her mouth and go like...  Couldn't reach.  Oh, it couldn't reach.  So she just kind of flapped her arms near her ears and went...  Oh, because she was so excited.  He broke down.  He starts crying. 
[03:14:00]  I didn't...  Anyway, first of all...  You...  All right, let's just...  Bob, Bob, did you ever do a midget?  No.  Midgets smell different.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm going to tell you.  One thing on my list, bodybuilder and a midget.  I want to fuck a bodybuilder?  You never...  A guy bodybuilder?  A woman?  A woman?  Oh, I want to get that clear.  What's the difference?  Well, I want to get a clear.  What's the difference?  No difference.  Nah, there's one...  They got nothing here.  They got a little...  I want...  There's something about women bodybuilders that I want to fuck one.  That's a very masculine body. 
[03:14:30]  I don't know why you would...  Two spectrums I haven't fucked.  I don't know why you would want to do that.  I want a little midget.  You're getting a little on the suspicious side.  Well, not suspicious.  I want to fuck a midget because I just would love to just...  You can't get it in.  It's going to...  That's got to be...  It's going to bang up against the back.  You need a tube of Vaseline.  A tube of K-1.  How great would that feel to fucking have that feeling that my dick is big again?  Yeah, but it's a little thing.  It's like...  It's a little thing.  In that little stubby hand.  I want that little fucking rump roast ass.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  They really do.  They have a little ham ass. 
[03:15:00]  I want to put netting on it and just fucking baste it.  I want to just grab that little...  Those little fat legs and...  Tie her to your chest.  Yeah.  The only midget that ever looked good enough to fuck was the one from Total Recall.  Yes.  She might be a fuckable midget.  Yeah, her eye socket was actually hanging out.  That chick.  No, not that one.  The little one.  The little midget that...  Not the three-chinned bitch.  She had a fucked up eye, too.  The little midget had a fucked up eye.  The little midget didn't have a fucked up eye.  I guarantee you.  The little girl was a mutant.  She had a fucked up eye.  The other one was a midget. 
[03:15:30]  That was her mutancy.  Do you know that a...  Mutancy?  That is.  Do you know that a crowded elevator smells different to a midget?  He's got his nose in everybody's business.  Boom.  Let's go to Dale in Tennessee.  Dale?  Yeah, man.  Play Frank some of the clips when Porky's ass Bob broke his knee.  How tough guy he was then.  Well...  Yeah, but you fucking idiots are acting like I'm a tough guy.  I'm not a tough guy, you shithead. 
[03:16:00]  I snapped my ACL and I asked another man to hold my hand.  The pain was a little fucking...  Wait, do we have the long clip?  The longer clip or whatever?  Ant's got just a quick one, right?  Yeah, I just got the one where he groans.  I know E-Rock's got it.  Who's this?  We've got to get Frank out of here, but we've got to play this one last thing for you.  Okay.  If we can find it real fast.  Probably E-Rock or somebody's choice.  These guys can't find it fast.  They're really selling me out, aren't they?  Oh, they're searching, just looking for...  These fucking fans are really fucking just...  We really are the worst because we see that there's a relationship developing between  you and Frank Vincent.  We're like, fuck that. 
[03:16:30]  We're blowing this up.  That's all right.  It's fine, man.  He's all right.  He's a funny guy.  Way to go.  I like that whole black girl.  Crack midgets.  That black girl thing was brilliant, actually.  It was brilliant.  Is that part of your act?  No.  You've got to write that one.  No, me and Patrice...  That's ready to go, man.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's ready to go.  You can do that on the stage.  I do, wouldn't you?  I tell you, it's so funny, though.  A white guy talking about black issues.  There was one time, and I'm sitting there in front of the gorilla cage, and I'm watching  the gorillas, and they're amazing, unbelievable. 
[03:17:00]  I'm just sitting there like, wow, oh my God, and the little ones playing with the middle  ones, and they're just walking around like, you know, this black lady in a sundress, she  had to be like 60-something, shuffles up with little flippers on and comes up, holy  shit, motherfucker.  She taps me.  She's like, look at them.  They're like humans.  She goes, I know a motherfucker look just like that.  Oh, fuck.  Hilarious.  True story.  I know a motherfucker.  Fucking dropped to the ground laughing.  I'm dying.  I said it on stage that night, and then I got to fucking ship three black people like, 
[03:17:30]  that's fucking racist.  Oh, right, right, right.  You fuck, that's hilarious.  She said it.  She said it.  I know a motherfucker look just like that.  Mel Brooks in Blazing Saddles.  Yeah.  When they were going cross country, they had the covered wagons.  You saw three or four covered wagons, and you saw one isolated covered wagon with the  big black lady and the little kids, and Mel Brooks is coming up the hill with the Indian  chief and the white horse.  He comes up the hill, he stops, he looks, he goes, Schwarzers. 
[03:18:00]  This is like in the West.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Schwarzers.  He goes, ooh, they darker than us.  That's like the old days.  A little Rodney Allen Rippey.  The clip's three minutes.  Should we go with it or what?  Here's a little.  That's an actual Bob Kelly painful groan.  Snapped my ACL.  Why don't we play the clip for Frank Vincent or at least a part of it?  He broke his knee.  His knee kind of went backwards.  Jumped up for a pass, came down, snapped his name. 
[03:18:30]  I snapped my knee.  My knee snapped in half.  It went sideways and backwards.  MCL, ACL, snapped my leg.  I thought I broke my knee.  I don't know.  You can't break your knee, but.  Oh, that's bad.  Snapped all the ligaments in there.  But there's some great stuff in here.  All the good stuff.  What did you do, make fun of it?  You laughed?  No, these guys actually fucking.  They made fun of it.  Yeah, listen to this.  Listen to this poor bastard.  Audio of him breaking his knee because they were filming it for Torgasm on HBO. 
[03:19:00]  They started a football play, obviously.  Jim.  He's down, you're way down.  He's back.  He's back.  He's moving before he heads up off.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  I snapped my knee, man.  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  Get 911, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  Lay back, lay back.

I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Oh, no.  I heard my knee break, dude.  You made it just popped it.  You're going to be okay.  I broke my knee, man.  I can't bend my knee.  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  Hang on.  Relax, relax. 
[03:20:00]  Fuck.  Hang on, hang on.  Come on.  I broke my knee, dude.  Hang on.  Got some ice?  I broke my leg.  Hang on, hang on.  I broke it.  Can you try to stretch it?  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crack.  Can you try to stretch it?  No, dude.  I go and move.  All right.  Just relax.  Just relax.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't move it.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  Stay, stay.  I'm in so much pain, man.  I'm in so much pain.  I broke my knee, man. 
[03:20:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, poor guy.  Get some ice.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  Just leave.  Just leave.  Can you get him some water?  Hold my hand, man.  You want some water?  I got to squeeze some.  Pull out his pop.  You want to try and turn on your side?  You can act like a man.  I broke that foot today.  What's wrong with you?  I broke it.  You're going to be right.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg, man.  Where does it hurt?  Where does it hurt?  This dick. 
[03:21:00]  Is this guy an asshole?  Where it's broken, idiot.  I just said knee 97 times.  Knee 9 times.  Call 911.  Does it hurt on the outside?  There it is.  You went to shock.  You went to shock, dad.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  You poor motherfucker, man.  I feel bad for you.  What did they do?  Tape it up?  I broke my fucking knee, man.  It is.  All right.  It goes on for like forever. 
[03:21:30]  I snap my knee.  The next day, they get on the phone, and they're like, hey, man.  I'm on Vicodin.  I'm all fucked up.  All right.  They get me on the phone.  I'm talking like, hey, man.  I hope you feel better.  I'm like, thanks, guys.  I really was like, wow.  That's pretty.  And as soon as I get off the phone, they grab the other guy, Dave, and they go, you better  get us that audio by tomorrow.  Immediately.  Immediately.  Immediately.  Why did they have an audio?  Because we were doing a show for HBO, and we were taping it, and I say HBO, like he's  going to bond with me.  Yeah.  I knew that's where you were going.  I'm sorry.  I'm a fucking asshole.  You know, that network that you had that little show on. 
[03:22:00]  It was on HBO.  I just got invited to the Fag Awards.  That's all right.  Yeah.  I got invited to the Fag Awards.  Steve.  We had listeners do remixes.  Oh, my God.  And we got to do the Goodfellas one really fast.  It's a classic.  They took that, and they remixed it into other things.  Yeah.  And this is one of the better ones that came in.  Do you have it, or...  Bill?  Yeah, all right.  I'll play this.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back. 
[03:22:30]  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  What do you want, fucko?  You want some?  Huh?  What are you doing?  Oh, no.  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man!  Fuck!  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead! 
[03:23:00]  Hold my hand, man.  I'm going to squeeze something.  Oh, fuck!  That's good.  That's good.  That's well done.  That's good, yeah.  The spider one's a good one, too.  Joe Pesci.  That's a good one.  We got that one for Frank Vincent.  Yahoo!  You motherfuckers!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  I broke my knee, man!  He's making me believe in me. 
[03:23:30]  Everywhere.  I broke my knee, man!  He's a fucking doctor.  All right, so he got shot.  What is it?  A big fucking knee?  Vito!  Vito, get a towel!  Nice fucking game.  I broke my fucking knee, dude!  I heard it play, dude.  Ben Casey, the little prick.  Look!  Let him crawl there like he crawls for the fucking...  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck!  Don't give me a shit now.  I broke my knee, dude.  I'm going to make a big fucking thing out of it, you little prick.  You're going to make me think what the fuck I did in.  I'm in so much pain, man.  Fuck it. 
[03:24:00]  I got a great hand.  You're a little...  It's an accident.  You hear the comedy in Pesci?  Yeah, it's so great.  It just comes...  Oh, yeah.  It reeks with it.  I mean, everything he does,  even though it's serious.  Yeah.  You know...  That's what made those scenes so great.  When he's at the bar,  and he grabs the guy by the tie  and smashes the bottle over the stories he's telling before that.  Ba-da-bing-boom!  Huh?  I thought I told you to go fuck your mother!  Bang-boom!  And Marty lets you do that if you show that to him.  You know what I mean? 
[03:24:30]  In a rehearsal...  Yeah.  ...that you could do that.  He's just...  Okay, that's good.  We'll do that.  Because Joe captured that.  That character lives.  That character that Joe...  Oh, yeah.  He's in...  He's in...  It's upstate.  And he's really a guy that we knew very, very well.  Whoa.  And he had that kind of an edge.  And two seconds turned on you.  Wow.  But the guy's real?  He's real.  He lives.  He's a real guy.  He lives.  He breathes.  I was in a restaurant.  He listens to the next time.  And I'm sitting, having dinner.  And he's at the other table.  And as I came in the restaurant...  Hey, how are you?  I knew him.  I'm going to mention his name. 
[03:25:00]  How are you?  Good.  He said, who are you with?  I said, some people.  Meanwhile...  I said, you don't know them.  Some people.  Meanwhile, he knows one of the people.  So we sat down.  And now he's carrying on at this table where he's...  And he says something about Hollywood.  I said, yeah, Hollywood.  He says, come on.  Come over here.  What?  Yeah.  He says, I'll fucking leave you right where you're sitting.  He says, what's the matter?  You tell me you're not a number of nobody?  I know there's fucking people over here.  Who do you think you are?  Come over here.  And he has your fucking...  He's serious. 
[03:25:30]  He's dead fucking serious.  Holy shit.  I will leave you right where you're fucking standing, you motherfucker.  Don't you ever talk to me like that.  Just because he wanted the attention.  Right.  Wow.  Well, you have them in Boston.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, they turn and like Joe says, I make you laugh.  How do I make you laugh?  Yeah, yeah.  And that's the word this guy would do.  The guy who used to own the restaurant, he was the nicest guy in the world.  Come in.  Hey, how are you?  Smile.  Woo, hey, good to see you.  Two seconds.  Two seconds later, he's chasing the cook around with a butcher knife.  Throwing plates at his face. 
[03:26:00]  Wow.  And the cook was like a tough Italian kid.  I remember he did a big meeting.  They'd have these meetings.  Yeah.  And he'd start fucking...  It was hilarious.  They'd literally be like, you fucking listen to me.  You fucking...  It's all Italian waitresses.  Me.  Right?  Me and my friend Al.  He's like, let me tell you something.  These busboys, these Spanish fucking busboys, you boss them around.  All right?  They're not...  Let me tell you something.  They're Spanish.  They're not niggas.  Oh, shit.  And we're like, oh my God.  I'm like, you can't...  And everybody... 
[03:26:30]  You're right.  He's right.  They're not niggas.  Oh, God.  All the waitresses are nodding.  Like, he's absolutely right.  We treat him...  I'm sorry.  Yeah, right.  I'm like, did you just say what the fuck you just said?  I'm in the room.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  You can't say that?  Just trying to make a few bucks, man.  You're trying to...  I'm like, give me a break.  That's the way they are.  That's the way those guys are.  You can't...  You can't...  And two seconds.  He would come in.  I'd always say, hey, how are you?  And when he was...  This is the scariest part, when they're nice to you.  Oh, yeah.  When they're nice to you.  That's when you're scared the most.  Hey, how are you?  How are you? 
[03:27:00]  Hey, how are you?  I'll tell you something, you motherfucker.  That's it.  Just do a switch that quick.  There was a guy that used to have to...  How are you?  He got out of federal prison.  He had to work over in his parking lot that he owned.  Right?  I used to have to bring him his food every day from the restaurant.  I'd have to bring him like six bags of whatever to this little box.  And you go in, he's got fucking, you know, thousand dollar suits on, but he's parking cars.  But he's not doing it.  He's got this old guy that does all the shit.  Yeah.  So he's just fucking eating.  He's just eating in his box all day. 
[03:27:30]  But he has to have a job.  And he, and I used to get scared every fucking time I go down there.  I'd hear anybody, hey, come here for a second.  I got a phone call one night from, I got a phone call on my phone.  He called, he's like, hey, don't, it's Richie.  I'm like, you're kidding me.  Why?  He's calling me.  I got my number.  I got my number.  I don't know how.  He goes, come on over.  He invites me over.  I'm like, okay, I got to go to his house.  Yeah, no good.  He knows my friend, his cousin.  I'm over there for three hours.  I thought I'm going to get killed.  And then he goes, listen, come over for Thanksgiving. 
[03:28:00]  I like you, kid.  I'm like, well, I got my family.  He's like, you come over.  Bring them.  Yeah.  Bring everybody.  Yeah, you do it.  You come here.  Thanksgiving, you're here.  And then he just leaves.  So I got to, around like five o'clock, I got to go.  I got to go.  My whole family's like, where are you going?  I have to go.  I got to go.  I got to go to the mob guy's house.  So I'm sitting there like this.  Like, hey, I'm sitting at his house.  And everybody's just freaking out.  He's like, hey, come on in.  The nicest guy ever.  Then tomorrow he's going to call you and say, yes, I need a favor. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was so scared.  Remember, you came over my house.  Remember, we broke bread.  It was nice.  You know, you got to know, we'll kill this guy for me.  Yeah, yeah.  Give him a good beating.  Make sure he knows where he came from.  I tell you, the guy gave me, my friend, one of these guys gave me a knife as a gift.  Right?  So he picks me up.  He goes, come on, let's go.  Give me a ride around the block.  I go, okay.  I give him a ride.  He goes, give me that knife you got.  Drop me off right here.  He drops me.  I drop him off.  He comes back in the car around the corner.  I go, where's my knife?  He goes, don't worry.  I'll get you another one. 
[03:29:00]  Every time I went to his house, every time I went to this guy's house, he would make  me take my socks off and put brand new socks on.  Why?  I think he got a bunch of.  He just had socks in a closet.  You know, they get these, they get something.  Yeah.  Fell off the truck, a few boxes.  He didn't like that I had, like, my socks, my white socks might be a little gray or dirty  old.  He'd go, take your shoes off.  Put these socks on.  He probably wanted to see if you had a battery for a wire in your sock.  I tell you the funniest thing ever is that when one time he goes, listen, go in that closet, 
[03:29:30]  you tell me, you find the secret compartment.  So I went into his closet.  It was like 20 minutes.  I'm trying to pull nothing.  Then he goes like this.  He goes in, he hits this, knocks this, boom, boom.  He had around 18 little hidden things.  Machine guns.  Yeah.  With all kinds of shit that you'd never find.  He had it built like Japanese wood makers came in and if you push this and knock that  and tap on this twice, it just opens up and there's this shit everywhere. 
[03:30:00]  They're weird guys.  Oh, they never use their stoves either.  Never.  No.  No, it was just shit like newspapers and papers in the stove.  If it's a single Italian guy and they don't use the stove, they eat out every night.  I understand that much, but I have a stove at all though.  They put stuff inside the stove.  Yeah, in the closet.  Oven.  Yeah, in the oven.  Don't turn the oven on.  It's like a file cabinet.  Yeah, exactly.  What is it?  They just hide shit in the stove. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, that's fantastic.  Oh, man.  That's amazing.  I actually did a movie in Boston, an independent film called Last Night at Eddie's, where it  was a mob movie, half hour.  Billy Burr was in it.  He killed me in the end.  It was like me and his first movie ever.  An independent film over there and they hired a mob guy, but the guy, he booked it was great,  but then when we started rehearsals, he was a gay guy.  He was a gay actor.  So he would be like, his line was like, where's my fucking money?  I want my money.  I'm supposed to flip out.  I'd come in and he'd be like, so where's my money? 
[03:31:00]  And this guy was like, dude, no, you got to do it the way you did it.  He's like, well, it's organic.  And trust me, by the time we shoot, it will be there, but I have to let it grow.  This guy was like, you got to be shitting me.  So he comes over to me.  He's like, what do I fucking do?  I'm shooting in seven days.  I don't have money to fuck with this guy.  I brought him down to the North End, to the restaurant, and I introduced him to this guy.  So he goes over.  He's in a suit, gazelle glasses, diamonds, jumpsuit. 
[03:31:30]  And he's like, I'll be right with you.  He goes and talks to two guys.  Then he goes, one more second, goes and talks to three other guys.  Then he goes, one more.  He walks over to another group.  Then he walks up.  He goes, how are you guys fucking doing?  I'm in more huddles than a fucking NFL quarterback.  And then he goes to the kid, I'll do your movie, but not for you, for fucking Bobby.  The kid didn't even ask him yet, but he's doing the movie.  So the kid, he really had no choice.  And we went in to rehearse that scene.  And he's supposed to flip out and go, where's the money?  Right?  So I walk in.  He flips out.  He goes, where's the fucking money?  I'll fucking kill you dead, kid. 
[03:32:00]  Grabs me, starts smashing my head off the table.  Really?  Cut.  He's not acting.  He throws me across the fucking room, all the chairs.  The kid's like, that's it.  I'm like, no, that's not it.  He fucking really beat the shit out of me, dude.  This is an actor?  He's not an actor.  He's a fucking guy.  He's a thug.  That's right.  Man.  He catered every day of the movie, so how great was that?  That was good.  That was good.  That's a win-win.  We went from pizza to fucking chicken bono for tuna. 
[03:32:30]  We've been talking for an hour and a half straight.  We've got to get Frank out of here.  He was supposed to stop by for 15 minutes.  What a pleasure.  What are we plugging there?  We've got Sopranos on A&E.  Sopranos on A&E.  New season on HBO in what?  April 8th.  April 8th.  April 8th.  Premiers.  Website, frankvinson.com.  Go home and get your Shine Bucks.  T-shirts.  Early bets.  And we now have Phil Leotardo.  Picked Shine T-shirts.  We have, what do you call them?  Pads? 
[03:33:00]  Pads.  Mouse pads.  Mouse pads, okay.  Mouse pads.  We've got a lot of stuff.  You've got a lot of stuff.  And what's the recording message thing?  What is that?  What's that?  You record a message on your thing.  You leave a message for me.  I read the message and we either put it on or we don't put it on.  Oh, cool.  So it's good.  And let's not forget about the book and paperback.  Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man just came out.  It's in all the stores.  Appreciate it.  We've got a cigar coming out.  We've got a Subway commercial coming.  Look at this.  He's an entrepreneur.  He's an entrepreneur.  He's an entrepreneur. 
[03:33:30]  Keeps working.  It's really a pleasure to be here on O&A.  Hey.  You almost forgot our names, didn't you, Frank?  No, I hope you didn't have it.  He forgot my name.  He just shook my hand.  I just shook my hand.  Fucking Bobby.  And then he shook my hand.  And this guy.  Bobby from Boston.  Goddamn fucking Bobby.  Bobby.  Yeah, cocksucker.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  You're a funny guy and I appreciate you.  You're human, man.  Nice to meet you.  Bob Kelly is a hilarious guy.  Invite me back and we'll do it.  Absolutely.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We're going to go to break with the Bob Kelly remix of I Broke My Knee, Man. 
[03:34:00]  This was done by one of the fine listeners.  Check it out.  Down.  You're way down.  Keep down.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!

[03:34:30]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I'm going to squeeze something on the side.  I broke my knee, man.  It bent back.  Is it hyperextend?  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, my God.  It bent back. 
[03:35:00]  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Water can, man.  I'm going to squeeze something.  Anybody have some, like, Advil? 
[03:35:30]  Oh, motherfucker.  Oh my god, I don't believe it.  Ah, it's fucked up.  You mother.  Ah, what the fuck?  I got to squeeze it.  Can I go on more? 
[03:36:00]  I got to squeeze it.  I got to squeeze it.  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg.  I broke it.  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crash.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude. 
[03:36:30]  I'm in so much pain, dude.  I'm in so much pain. 
[03:37:00]  On Saturday, January 13th at 10 p.m., make sure you catch our old pal Louis C.K.'s newest stand-up special on HBO, Louis C.K. Shameless.  This is his third solo stand-up special for HBO, and if you heard him on our show, then you already know he absolutely kills.  But if you're new to this world and don't know who Louis C.K. is, then here's the deal.  He's funny. He's a friend of the show. He wrote and directed Pootie Tang. He won an Emmy for The Chris Rock Show. 
[03:37:30]  He's also written for The Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and Saturday Night Live.  And last summer, as you all should know, Louis C.K. created and starred in HBO's Lucky Louis with her own little Jimmy Norton.  So don't miss out. Watch Louis C.K.'s latest stand-up special on HBO.  Louis C.K. Shameless premiering Saturday, January 13th, 10 p.m. Eastern, only on HBO.  That's Louis C.K. Shameless on Saturday, January 13th at 10 p.m. Eastern, only on HBO. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, God. Bob Kelly's been making me laugh all day, and Anthony, of course, as well.  And, uh, God.  I just, we just laughed so fucking hard during the, uh, the commercial break or whatever the break is called over here at XM.  And I guess the pal talkers heard it because those mics were on.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, holy shit.  Frank Vincent laughed, and we were commenting that, uh, you know, you and Frank were getting along very well. 
[03:38:30]  We were swimmingly.  Swimmingly.  Swimmingly.  Yeah.  And then, uh, I ruined it.  And then you ruined it.  Well, I commented that I saw something going on.  I shook hands with Frank.  I said, thank you for showing up.  It's a pleasure as always.  Yeah.  And then, uh, he, uh, complimented Bobby, said, you're a very funny guy and everything.  Right.  And, uh, there was some kind of information exchange.  I think he wants to catch a show. 
[03:39:00]  He wants to come to a show sometime.  Or something like that.  That's pretty flattering, right?  So I saw, I saw, like, some writing going on, and I was like, oh, that's kind of cool.  Like, Bobby, Frank Vincent, that's kind of a cool friend to have to show up to the show.  And Bobby has to completely fucking ruin the image of a friend having a big show business friend.  And by, how did you put it?  Big mafia actor in Hollywood.  You're a ballsy comic.  And then, yeah, you ruined it.  I'd love to say it, but how did you put it, the scenario?  He said that you guys really made a connection. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  And I was like, yeah.  I would suck if we were doing, like, an Opie and Anthony gig, and he showed up, and you guys catch me sucking him off in a hotel room.  Just unexpectedly walk in.  It's like The Shining when you walk in.  You're fucking blowing Frank Vincent.  The only way I can get off is if I suck a fucking old dude's conks.  And then I said, it wouldn't ruin it for me, because I would expect it.  Like, ah, Bobby.  Ah, Bobby.  He's not even gay. 
[03:40:00]  It's just something he has to do to get rid of the memories for the foster home.  Guys, I got to do this.  Back up.  Oh, guys.  That's not my want to do.  I got to do this.  It's not gay if you've been abused by foster parents.  You know, the funniest part is I've never talked about that on the show, where you just somehow assume it, and you're right on the money.  Like, when you've been abused by some dude in Lynn.  We don't understand.  We're like, ah, he's got to do that. 
[03:40:30]  You know.  It's not like he's blowing a gay guy.  Hey, Matt.  Hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Back up.  Shut the fucking door.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Oh, did he act?  Oh, he's a good actor.  He had that acting thing going on.  Yeah.  I think he'll go places.  You think?  God damn, is that funny?  I have a good career.  Fucking holy shit.  Could you see it?  And it wasn't even one of us that brought it up.  Right.  You know, like, it would be bad enough if we went, you know, hey, Bobby, why don't you fucking suck his cock or something? 
[03:41:00]  It means I was actually thinking about it.  Yeah, it's like Bobby just goes, could you imagine if you guys walked in on me sucking Frank Vincent's cock?  And we weren't even fucking anywhere near the vicinity of that planet when you came up with that one.  I tell you, because I always get, you know, when I make friends with another man, when you make a connection, I always get messed up.  I'm like, you know, what do you want?  Where's this going?  Well, I always get weird.  You know, I'm like, I don't know.  I'm socially awkward.  Is that what it's called? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, well, I guess.  Fucking sickly perverse.  What are you socially awkward?  Fucking sucking a cock.  Good life experiences.  Makes good talk for radio.  What are you doing?  Different black chicks.  You don't ask.  I'm loading up my bed.  Just let them be.  Yeah, but it's like, you're a radio guy, and I'm like, I'm looking at you, you're doing, and you go over there, and he's actually, he looks like he's fucking selling insurance on the side.  Did I not completely carry on that conversation during when I was fussing with stuff?  No one knows what he does. 
[03:42:00]  You got a fucking, you got a, you got a briefcase.  I think he just launched a missile or something.  Yeah, I don't know.  What the fuck are you doing?  I'm playing video games.  I just assume it's important.  I don't know.  There's all sorts of computer equipment he's opening, and, well, and installing.  You're the type of guy that keeps those little twisty ties that come with your computer cords?  It's the only way the cords stay organized.  No, actually, it's going to be, hold on, and before we move on, because we'll probably stay on that for about ten minutes, Jeremy in Cleveland, go ahead. 
[03:42:30]  Hey, Bobby, I just wanted to ask, man, did you call no homo in between that conversation?  Oh, sorry.  No, there was no homo.  No, there was no no homo said during that fucking conversation.  So homo.  Yeah, so homo.  I called so homo.  He's got to do what he's got to do.  He doesn't know his real parents.  His real parents didn't really want him, so, you know.  Cut the guy some slack.  Yeah, cut the guy slack.  He's got to suck old guy cut.  I had to blow a guy in a closet for a steak when I was young. 
[03:43:00]  What?  Hey, got to eat.  What the hell happened?  Hey, what happened?  What did we do?  Why are you guys looking at me like that?  It was a sunny day on a porch.  What's happening?  Hot, but not that hot.  What is it?  It smells like feet?  What?  Oh, my God.  Spongy?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  Fucking awful.  What are you fucking...  Are you going to another day job?  What are you doing?  You're on the fucking radio. 
[03:43:30]  Dude, we don't have...  You're going to pay thousands of dollars to be your fucking number...  Millions.  Sorry.  Let's put things together.  You fucking son of a bitch.  And you...  You're absolutely right.  Stop it.  Now it's just garbage that I'm cleaning up my area.  Yeah, but...  There we go.  What did you just do?  Yeah, what is that?  We really don't know.  Well, it's a laptop.  You know, I have an air card now.  Wonderful.  Get on the internet anywhere.  You don't need your Wi-Fi connection.  Verizon.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's the greatest thing.  You're waiting for the flight to take off, and you're surfing the internet real fast. 
[03:44:00]  It's like 80 bucks, right?  It's amazing.  I don't know.  Company pays for...  Company takes care of that, too.  I found out also, because you...  Now I'm going to go on another tangent, because of you bringing up the airport.  Yeah.  Opie is the guy that has to be yelled at by the fucking flight attendant to shut the shit off.  Because nothing's going to happen.  I've never noticed this.  I noticed it a couple times.  I thought it was a fluke, like you were in the middle of something.  You're the fucking guy...  We've traveled way too much together.  That will not...  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  That will...  He'll be with the fucking PSP.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da.  The PSP's going to take down the fucking airplane.  The fucking plane's rolling down the runway.  That would fucking be hilarious if every time he turned it on and the plane started crashing,  then he turned it off, it was fine.  He hits one button.  Like the fire button.  Every time he hits the fire button, we lose the fucking elevator control on the plane.  That shit is bullshit.  It is bullshit.  And you know why it is?  If something was really going to happen...  Yeah.  Something was really going to happen, you're going to trust somebody with a cell phone 
[03:45:00]  on the plane?  They'd be collecting those fucking things at the door.  Thank you.  I'll tell you why.  Thank you.  They just want you to pay attention when they do all the stuff at the beginning.  Right.  And you can't get cell service in the air anyways because it trips the satellite satellite...  You're flying and it just can't catch a beam.  It's not going to catch a cell signal.  Yeah, it's not going to catch anything.  It's too close to the earth.  The fucking...  You drive a few miles away from it, you're not going to get it.  It's all bullshit, yeah.  But people have made phone calls from...  I left my...  Yeah, you could get a signal.  But if not, if they're like 35,000 feet, it's a little rough. 
[03:45:30]  But the thing is, those are the rules.  And when they say, please turn off all devices that have an on-off switch right now, OAP is  there.  And then the stewardess will come by and say something and still...  I want to be that guy now.  And then the stewardess had to go, excuse me.  You can't stop in the middle of a game of Luminous 2.  Oh, fuck.  More buttery beats.  Actually, the music isn't buttery.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be on the taxiway here for another 10 minutes because OAP is 
[03:46:00]  playing Luminous.  Can't quite take off yet.  Feel free to punch him in the face.  Yeah.  There's a great song on...  It's all really cool music.  Buttery beats.  It's not buttery beats this time.  It's rocking stuff.  But then they have music videos in the background as you're trying to do this thing.  For the people that don't know, Luminous and Luminous 2, it's kind of like Tetris.  Like Tetris.  But it's all squares that are broken up into quadrants. 
[03:46:30]  And then there's like, you know, two of the same color.  Sometimes it's the same color.  Sometimes it's one color.  And then...  They drop?  And then three blocks are the other color.  Yeah.  And you got to kind of spin them around and put them in the position.  You got to make complete...  A la Tetris.  Complete blocks of the same color.  It's like Tetris on steroids.  On crystal meth.  Yeah, crystal meth.  I mean, it's like these...  It's music videos just popping at you as you're trying to play.  Right.  Wow, that sounds annoying.  It's really annoying, but it's...  It's really annoying. 
[03:47:00]  It's really addicting.  And then there's a song that I'm really into that's on there.  You like one of the songs on the video game?  Yeah, it's a lot cooler than the buttery beats that I...  I openly admitted that I like.  This must be really cool.  It's called All Around the World or something like that, if we can find it.  It's a really cool song.  But anyway, what were we talking...  Oh, yeah.  So I don't turn the PSP off.  Yeah.  Until they tell me two or three times.  I wish I had the...  I don't...  You know what?  I was raised with that fear.  You know, that Catholic feel.  You have to do what you're told, like cattle.  I want to...  I'd love... 
[03:47:30]  I see guys like him, and I get mad at him, but then I get jealous because I'm like,  this guy doesn't give a shit.  I get pissed.  He's going to be told two or three times to shut it off.  Because I know it's bullshit, what they're telling me.  Good for you.  A lot of times, like, if I was probably too distracted, a lot of times I'll play the PSP.  I know she's coming to tell me to turn it off, so I'll turn it upside down and make believe  I'm not playing.  She goes past me, and I go right back.  Oh, my God.  That bugs me.  That bugs me.  That makes me mad.  If something does happen...  I've had asses tell me to turn my shit off because they truly believe that it's going  to take down the aircraft. 
[03:48:00]  And you tell them it's not...  I'm like, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, that would bug the shit out of me.  When I see guys yapping still on their phone, and the door's shut, and we're pulling away,  and they're like...  Loud guys, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're taking off.  We should be arriving at...  Shut the fuck up.  You can talk...  You can talk like this.  But why don't you ever say, shut the fuck up?  Why can't I say, hey, shut your fucking mouth?  Because then you're making a scene.  Oh.  No scene making.  No scene making.  He's making a scene.  I'll say, shut up.  If a baby's crying, I'll just go, shut up. 
[03:48:30]  Shut up.  I won't yell at the kid.  I'll just kind of put my head up so the shut up spreads about the cabin.  Yeah.  And then the parent knows that the shut up came from somewhere, and to just pull a fucking  mash.  Speaking of planes.  The last episode of MASH, where you choke the child, and then make believe it's a chicken  in your head.  Speaking of planes, breaking news.  Body fell, found in the...  Wheel well of a plane.  Someone trying to come to America. 
[03:49:00]  Another idiot trying to get here, not realizing it's fucking the top of Mount Everest inside  a fucking airplane, unless you're in the cabin that's heated and pressurized.  While you're all nice and warm, a mere seven, eight feet above you.  Right.  Watching some cool, like, movie.  Yeah.  Enjoying a beverage.  You're freezing to death.  Playing a video game.  There's a guy.  You're turning into an ice cube.  I swear.  It is.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  You've seen the guys climbing Mount Everest, getting to the summit.  You see how they're dressed, and what they've been through, and how they're getting... 
[03:49:30]  You're getting that type of weather a mere few inches away.  Yeah.  And there's a guy thinking he's going to fucking hold onto a wheel, thinking this thing gets  10 feet off the ground, and that's how it's going to fly the whole fucking way.  You ever think that shit when you have your head against a window, you're like a mere...  That's it.  ...like inch or whatever it would be, is it's...  It's 80 below zero with a 500 mile an hour wind.  I wonder what the wind chill is on that motherfucker.  And you've got this dumb piece of glass that is protecting you from death. 
[03:50:00]  But the glass is good.  Right.  Someone said it was good, so it's got to be good.  Glass.  Hey, here's an observation.  Bob in North Carolina.  Bob?  Yeah, I'm here.  Hi, Bob.  All right, cool.  Yeah.  I love you guys, man.  The show is great.  And I just want to say, aren't you closer to the satellite when you're in the air, Anthony?  I know you know everything.  Cell phones don't run on satellites, my friend.  What do they run, on the towers?  They run on cell towers that you see on buildings and other towers that are put up. 
[03:50:30]  Electric towers, even.  But they only have a limited range.  That's why in the older days, you lost your cell signal a lot more.  But there are more cells now, so you get better reception.  I think there is a satellite, though, Anthony.  I think there are satellites.  It's not satellite phones.  There are satellite phones.  I own one.  Why?  It's a wonderful device.  Why?  Because I got lost in the fucking woods one day and had no fucking cell reception.  This is exactly why I own one. 
[03:51:00]  How about this?  Don't go to the fucking woods anymore.  I won't.  But why do you need a satellite phone?  Just in case.  In Long Island?  And I take cruises a lot.  Cruises?  I take cruises to faraway lands, and you don't get any cell signal.  And I'm the guy that's on the beach going, yeah, yeah, Bob, how's that deal going?  That was me.  Bob's confused because Anthony said cruises.  He's talking about the Caribbean, not rest areas, Bob.  No, I didn't go cruising.  Listen, I'm not Al Pacino. 
[03:51:30]  I know what the fuck you mean.  Yeah, I'm sucking a cock through a hole in a fucking toilet stall.  Good.  Old man, cock.  If you need to know.  Hang on.  Let me move this antenna away from his nuts.  You'll never guess.  You want to talk to Frank Vincent?  Hold on.  I'm just saying.  You don't need a fucking Jurassic Park phone on a fucking boat.  No, it's...  All right?  You do, though.  For what?  You do.  Your cell phone doesn't work.  You're supposed to get away.  No.  You can get a...  You can't get away.  Listen, you can get a fucking cell phone that works on a boat. 
[03:52:00]  There's got to be a phone.  There's a phone.  How do you think they call?  There is a phone.  It costs you $8 billion a call, and you've got to be in your room and stuff.  And you can't just kind of hang out.  Like, I was hanging out on the deck drinking a little banana daiquiri, and then my brother  couldn't make it on the cruise.  So I give him a little call, and he's hearing, you know, the steel drums and everything,  and all annoyed that I was on the cruise.  And on the islands that you go to, there's no cell fucking service on the beach. 
[03:52:30]  I think there's cell service on...  There's nothing.  Yeah.  So you need the satellite phone.  What island are you going to?  Lost?  It's...  Jackass.  It's 2007.  They have phones.  I have a phone that I used in Aruba.  Well, I'm very proud of you.  Singular, you can use in Aruba.  You can use it in every island there is.  There are some...  You can use it in Brazil.  You can use it in fucking Guam.  That's new stuff, though.  There are some places.  Now, in April...  I only just started.  Let me tell you about the cruise we're going on in April. 
[03:53:00]  Do tell.  It goes from Miami...  Yes.  ...through the Panama Canal...  There's cell service.  ...up to L.A.  That's...  And then we fly back.  Do you think those savages, the entire way...  You mean one of the most fucking incredible things that ever was built?  The fucking Panama Canal?  I'm not talking about the canal.  I'm talking about the in-between.  Oh, you mean the jungle?  The fucking nothingness.  What are you getting out?  The hunt shit?  I mean, do you know something? 
[03:53:30]  I would love to fucking be with you sometime when something happened and you went,  I wish you had that fucking satellite phone.  But you told me not to bring it.  Oh, I don't have it.  No, I didn't bring it, Bobby.  I didn't want you to laugh at me.  I'm just saying...  By the way, so did you explain what you built during the break?  I wasn't building.  He really did build a fucking spaceship.  All I was doing was merely removing stuff from the impenetrable packaging that happens  these days.  I replaced my motherboard while I were on the break. 
[03:54:00]  You fucking nothing.  So I got the air card now.  So I got my laptop with me and a camera, a small little clip-on camera for PalTalk.  So now this is going to be a little test run.  You're on PalTalk in the live room right now.  They're here.  Hi, PalTalk live room.  I am going to broadcast my commute home because I drive like a fucking maniac and I am the  most racist piece of shit on the road. 
[03:54:30]  And I think that should be shared with the listeners.  But it has to be live.  It can't be a video.  No, no.  It's live.  It has to be live.  It's got to be live.  It's got to be live.  It's a videotape, but it's silly.  And then play it later?  Right.  Why would you do that?  Are you going to start broadcasting right after the show?  Like just walking?  So right after the – no, no.  I got to set it up in the truck.  I got to set it up in the truck.  So I'll go across the street, set it up in the truck, get it all clipped up, working  right.  And I'm thinking what view would be better?  Out the windshield so people could hear me and see what I'm dealing with or me? 
[03:55:00]  No, they want to see what you're seeing.  What I'm dealing with.  No, I think they should see out the windshield, but they'd be able to hear my fucking rantings  of the savage cab drivers and fucking animals that don't know how to drive.  Don't overact.  I'm not acting at all.  All right, good.  There will be no – look.  This is so weird.  You, my eight.  What the fuck did you just say?  You're an acting teacher.  Don't overact when you're dressed.  Let me tell you something also.  I'm not putting anything on.  If you see me drive on the sidewalks, it will not be for the cameras. 
[03:55:30]  Believe me.  I do this.  I've done this.  I've been there.  When there has not been a camera around.  Let me tell you something.  Probably you're insane.  And Jimmy – the little Norton's insane too.  Yeah, yeah.  I was actually in the car with him.  He was fucking – you know, he gets in fucking – and he's honking the horn.  I want to bite his fucking face.  He's so mad he's honking the horn, but he honked it so hard that it broke so he couldn't  use his horn anymore, but he was still in traffic and enraged. 
[03:56:00]  I can't tell you the satisfaction I got when he kept hitting it.  Fucking horn.  You fucking –  I'm all pissed off.  Because when you don't have a horn and you're angry and you're raised and you can't –  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's like building inside of you.  Well, this sounds like it's going to be fun.  So, you know, it could just be you're going to see a boring drive home.  Right.  But for the most part, usually, especially from here till I get to the expressway.  Right.  It's like fucking annoying motherfuckers in the way constantly. 
[03:56:30]  And which PalTalk room can they be in?  That will be the live room that we use here on a daily basis.  I can't say it as much, but I want to make it obvious there.  DeeDee, she's doing a show for us this weekend on 202.  DeeDee.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  What's up, DeeDee?  Thank you so much for letting me do this.  Do what?  Did we have a show?  Do the show.  You just bugged us.  Because I've been on you for how long?  All right.  All right.  Exactly.  You're doing a show?  Yes, I am. 
[03:57:00]  9 to 11 tomorrow night.  What channel?  202, your channel.  And who the fuck approved this?  And what's the show going to be about?  You did, Opie.  What?  Well, that was Anthony.  Twat.  Oh, Jesus.  She sounds like one of the kids I play on the video game.  Dude, change the map, dude.  Thank you.  She used to be the voice of the kids channel on XM until she did our show once.  And they fire her?  And they talk dirty.  Oh, that's her.  She has a great voice.  Dude, she's like a mess.  You would love her.  She woke up in Vegas married once. 
[03:57:30]  Married to some English counterfeiter.  No, but now she was in an alcoholic blackout.  No shit.  She was in an alcohol blackout.  Woke up in a, what, a gas station bathroom?  In New Orleans.  In New Orleans.  In New Orleans.  I had no idea how I got there.  I don't remember being on the flight from Philly to New Orleans.  She started following a trail of sucked cocks.  I found out where you came from.  Jesus.  A gas station bathroom in New Orleans.  Swear she has no clue how she got from Philly to this location. 
[03:58:00]  She got, what the fuck?  Seriously.  And then married some dude that was like money laundering.  An English counterfeiter, right?  A counterfeiter from England.  Yeah.  Did you ever wake up with your panties off?  Rolled up in a ball with a load of shit in them in the corner?  And she, and she, uh, uh, fucked her FedEx guy or her UPS.  You fucked a brown guy?  The UPS guy.  Yeah, her UPS guy.  He would come over in between deliveries and just have some.  Yeah, he'd let it hold you.  She was ordering shit just to get him over the house. 
[03:58:30]  FT, FTD.  Yeah.  There's just like shit.  Yeah, I needed a fucking pipe wrench.  Put it over there and pull your pants down.  Let me get that new strainer.  Well, hey, it worked.  Apparently so.  Wow.  Uh, have you been dating?  Is she hot?  Um, well, I, yeah.  You have?  Yeah.  What did you say, Bob?  Is she hot?  So, you've been dating?  Yes.  And, uh, who is this gentleman? 
[03:59:00]  He's an elder guy.  An older gentleman?  Is she hot?  How old is, um, how old is the guy?  Fifties.  He's in his fifties?  Yeah.  How old a girl are you?  Ballpark.  In my thirties.  Is she in your thirties?  Yeah.  And he's in his fifties?  Yeah.  How'd you meet him?  Um, through a friend.  Through a friend?  Mm-hmm.  I'm not going to say who it is. 
[03:59:30]  Is she a good looking girl?  All right.  I'm just saying, if you met through a friend, and he's in his fifties, did she work at some,  uh, uh, uh, like, place where they treat the elderly?  Oh, stop it.  No.  Well, he's not that old.  Is it mid-fifties?  Late?  It's good for a 50-year-old.  I'm shocked.  Wait, wait, wait.  He has a lot of energy.  Hold on.  Is it, is it early fifties, mid, or late?  Fifty-three.  That's not that bad.  Fifty-three.  Okay.  Well, see, my mom is sixty-three. 
[04:00:00]  I just think of the age between him and my mom.  It's kind of sick.  You think maybe someday he might try to have sex with your mom?  No, no, no, no.  It's just weird because I'm like, oh, my mom is only so many years older than him, and  I'm so many years younger.  Yeah.  It's just, that kind of messes with my head sometimes.  Yeah, you don't have to tell us.  It does.  It's a little weird.  Is she a big girl?  Are you a big girl?  Shut up.  I'm ignoring you.  Oh, Bobby.  No, I'm asking if she's a big girl. 
[04:00:30]  Are you in shape, honey?  I'm getting there because I have this thyroid condition called Hashimoto's.  Hashimoto.  He's coming over to do extreme fighting, by the way, Hashimoto, and he kicks ass.  You have Hashimoto's?  What the fuck is Hashimoto's?  Who told you you had Hashimoto's?  Too much sushi.  Too shit.  I ain't sushi.  Stop watching Grey's Anatomy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking Hashimoto's.  Grey's Anatomy.  It sounds like something from House.  It's called fucking ding-dong.  Speaking of house.  Stop stuffing them down your throat. 
[04:01:00]  I'm fat, too, so I'm telling you.  I gained a little weight, honey.  I'm with you.  You know what?  Come on now.  You can let them know.  I do have Hashimoto's.  Right, guys?  What?  Hashimoto's?  What is Hashimoto's?  It's a thyroid condition.  How the fuck are we going to back that up?  You told us.  Because we talked about it before, and you started playing Mr. Roboto when I told you last.  That sounds a little insensitive, but we might have.  Yeah, well.  What is Hashimoto's?  I remember, I have like a.  The only cure is to swallow egg rolls nonstop.  Or snot cum.  If I cared about you as a person, I would have remembered that, I guess. 
[04:01:30]  Hashimoto's disease.  Hey, Hashimoto's.  But I'm doing a lot better, and I'm losing weight.  Yes, I am.  Jesus Christ.  Are you?  Yes, I am.  It's probably the AIDS from fucking your blackout, your alcoholic blackout.  You know what?  I got tested.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Because actually, the guy that I've seen, the older guy, had a little bit of a scare,  and I had to get tested.  A little bit of a scare?  What does that mean?  You know what?  I'll save that for later.  No.  I just kind of, I got to know. 
[04:02:00]  What type of symptom scare did he have that led you to believe you needed to be tested?  I did a really stupid thing.  Uh-huh.  What was that?  I'm usually safe.  I usually, I'm good.  I usually wrap that, Willie, you know, before we get silly.  Oh, God.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah?  One time I didn't, and that's the one time I got a scare.  Oh, you-  It ended up that he had jockage.  What the fuck? 
[04:02:30]  Did she yell?  It ended up that he had what?  Jockage.  Wait, he had what?  He had jockage, but that was-  He had jockage, but you thought it was some kind of communicable disease?  I don't care what the fuck it was.  I was stupid for not, you know.  What was it?  It was jockage.  Obviously, you're in no position.  But that scared me, and I said I need every single test in the book done, and I was a  good girl.  I got it done, and I'm not letting that happen again.  How does a man get jock itch?  Isn't that like a fucking fungus on your cock?  Yeah, he works out. 
[04:03:00]  I guess he has to work out.  No, dude, he worked out.  It's like kind of like, you know, an athlete's foot.  You get that from not showering.  That's what it is.  Yes, he told me he got it at the gym, probably.  Yeah, you get it from not showering, or having another man rub his asshole on your nuts.  Anal sex with other men.  That's the only way you can get it from another man rubbing his ass juice on the side of your  nuts.  Or from a fucking yeast infection.  Yeah.  Does your vagina have a doughy substance coming out of it?  No, it wasn't on my end.  It was on his end.  Ah.  Yeah, well.  Your vagina... 
[04:03:30]  I'm fine, because I got every...  Oh, my God.  That freaked me out.  Your vag doesn't look like space food.  Vanilla pudding serving.  What is this?  Yeah, you don't have fucking ice cream from the future coming out of your pussy, do you?  No.  I told you.  I was...  I went to the doctor.  I was so afraid.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And she's like, well, you learned a lesson, didn't you?  I'm like, yeah.  The jockage scared me, and I'm not going to let that ever happen again.  At one time, you know, in how many years that I do that, and then that happens. 
[04:04:00]  I think the lesson was don't fuck old, dirty, fucking smelly guys.  Yeah, that don't shower.  And rub their cocks on men's assholes.  He's 53, and how old are you, sweetie?  30-something.  30-something.  Yeah, 39.  39?  No, I'm not 39.  You're 37.  She's 35.  I'm in that rank.  She's 37.  36.  Hey, listen, after 30, you might as well just tell us.  Yeah, really.  Nobody gives a shit.  What are you hiding?  You're in a serious relationship. 
[04:04:30]  Except a bunt.  How long?  No, I wouldn't call it serious.  Uh-oh, you're fucking other guys.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not fucking other guys.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  DeeDee, what's the...  I don't do...  That's one thing I don't...  Oh, all right.  What's this show going to be about Saturday?  Yeah, what is this?  Well, I did...  It's called Dee Dee's Basement.  I already did the show somewhere else, and I got it.  You know, a lot of your listeners liked it, so I'm going to do it again.  Dee Dee's Basement?  Yes.  What does that mean?  Yeah, what is that?  It's just the name of the show.  We just said, hey, let's just call it that. 
[04:05:00]  It's a lot simpler than Two Chicks and a Dick, yeah?  What?  Remember the other show was going to be Two Chicks and a Dick, and you gave me a big hassle  about that, so we just...  Two Chicks and a Dick, and their whole criteria for getting a guy on the show is that his name  had to be Dick so that it could fit the fucking name of the show.  There's a fucking pun?  Yeah.  Two Chicks and a Dick.  Oh, God.  She asked if we remembered.  Do you...  As soon as you hang up, I forget.  Well, that's why we didn't ask you about all this stuff, so you remind us what's going 
[04:05:30]  on in your life.  Right.  So I changed...  I worked...  I did what you told, because the last time I saw you guys...  How about a fat chick with a bag of chips?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you just eat on the air for two hours?  Why is it your basement?  I don't know.  We just called it that, and it worked.  Oh.  Did you ever wake up with crumbs on your chest?  No.  Oh, come on.  Because that's where a fat girl can live.  Yeah, exactly.  In the basement.  With cheese-it crumbs on your chest.  No.  Old orange-stained Doritos fingers.  Oh. 
[04:06:00]  And what do you talk about?  Like, what's the gist of the show?  Do you have anybody else with you, or is it you alone in the basement?  Yeah, I'll have somebody else with me.  I'll have a guy with me.  James Gumm, I hope.  And you're in his basement.  What type of guy?  He's a nice guy.  His name is Dion.  Oh, boy.  He's gay.  He's black.  Black or gay?  He is black.  Black and gay.  Because white people don't name their fucking kids' dumb names. 
[04:06:30]  Dion.  Dion, neon, fucking...  It would just be Don.  And we'd like to thank the black community for continuing to do that so we can throw away  resumes.  Oh, that's not nice.  And not nice, but...  True.  Tyrone, Dion can go right into the trash.  I read studies on this, man.  It comes out every so often in the paper.  You're killing your fucking kids' chances when a Kenesha is thrown into a fucking pile of 
[04:07:00]  resumes with like a Christine or something.  Lisa.  They throw those away.  That was Kenesha.  It was Christine and Lisa.  Kenesha gets fucking thrown in the shit can.  Yeah, D.D., give me some topics.  Because we want to wrap up here.  I think I should save that for tomorrow night and let it be a surprise.  Yeah, but just a topic is good.  No, you don't want to do that.  You want to tell everything right up front.  You got to have at least some...  You have to...  Why the fuck would they listen to your stupid show?  You're not that famous. 
[04:07:30]  No one gives a shit about you and your dumb basement show.  So what you do as a radio personality is you give them something.  They go, wow, you know what?  I'm slightly interested.  I'm going to listen tomorrow.  I hope he's moving.  Well, you know, it's an adulterated sex talk show.  If you leave it at a surprise...  I hope you're not surprised when no one fucking listens.  Opie's end of the fucking day mood swing.  Shit.  Opie just said it and you were yelling. 
[04:08:00]  See, D.D., what Opie was trying to say is maybe a little radio tease.  The reality is no one gives a shit about you and your show.  So you got to like kind of like, you know, hook them.  You got to give them a hook.  You got to give them something like, you know what?  I don't give a shit about this fat pig.  But I'm going to listen to her show to see what it's about because she piqued my interest.  You know...  Hey.  That isn't nice at all.  Whoa, D.D.  That's not nice.  D.D., put down the fucking devil dog. 
[04:08:30]  D.D., put down the fucking devil dog.  Fuck, man.  You know what?  And I have been doing radio for 12 years and people don't give a shit.  You got to give them something every day.  You got to tease stuff.  You got to go, hey, man, we got a girl that's going to be snorting cum tomorrow.  Please fucking listen to our show.  Now, everybody's going to be like, fuck, where is she coming in?  Even we at this point don't just go, oh, listen tomorrow.  It's going to be a surprise.  It's true.  Okay, no, obviously because of, you know, how I've talked with you guys before. 
[04:09:00]  And what I did on my show, when I did the audition on the other station, it's a sex talk show.  What was that?  She snorts when she laughs.  Not all the time.  It's adorable.  I got to be honest.  When she snorts, it's adorable.  Who said that?  Elpy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I like to snort.  And I like how you mispronounce stuff.  Oh, my God.  It's the Italian guy.  Sorry.  Tell Bob, see, I do remember a little bit about D.D.  Tell Bob how you say, you know, what you wear in the wintertime to keep warm. 
[04:09:30]  What I wear in the wintertime to keep warm?  On your hands, on your hands, on your hands.  I'm sorry.  My gloves?  What?  No, it's not gloves.  We've done this bit five times.  You can't play along?  It's gloves without the fingers.  It's called a fucking setup.  So you say mittens.  Oh, mittens.  I forgot.  Mittens.  Mittens.  Mittens.  That's how she says.  Well, I say gloves, too, but mittens.  Yeah.  She just fucking, she went gloves. 
[04:10:00]  Gloves.  And I was like, you fucking mittens.  Well, because we've done this bit a hundred fucking times.  I'm sorry.  Well, I don't remember everything either.  So you're going to do some sex talk, right?  And we'll talk about, you know, there's a lot of football going on here.  Might as well talk about it because you're not having any.  A lot of football.  You're fat.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There is no reason for that.  There's just, you know.  Oh, fuck.  What the fuck is that?  Jesus Christ, Opie.  That's just fucking. 
[04:10:30]  There's no reason.  Didi.  Didi, on behalf of this program, I would like to apologize.  Didi, on behalf of, I would like to apologize on everybody else's behalf.  Yeah.  Can I see a picture of her, though?  Is she fat?  Ah, the computer is busted.  I've seen bigger girls.  You have?  Where?  Yeah.  You know what?  They haven't seen me for how long?  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Benefit of the doubt.  Really?  How much have you lost since we've seen you last? 
[04:11:00]  30.  Jesus Christ.  30?  And you're still fat?  Only 150 to go.  Shut up.  No, it's not that bad.  He's exaggerating.  You lost 30 pounds and you still have to lose weight?  Yeah, because I had a thyroid condition.  It was serious.  I almost died.  Why?  No.  No.  A couple years ago before I started, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You almost died from being fat?  No.  It messes with your other organs.  It can mess with your heart. 
[04:11:30]  The thyroid, if your thyroid isn't functioning, your whole body is out of whack.  It certainly doesn't mess with your mouth.  Your whole body is out of whack.  Jesus.  Me and my throat.  Jesus Christ.  No, it really can kill you.  I mean, it's scary to see.  You are a disgusting fat body, private file.  Oh, my God.  Who fucks with every body part except your mouth?  Your ass looks like about 150 pounds of tooth bubblegum pile.  You know that?  I know you took.  But let me.  Shit.  Did she piss me off?  Didi.  Didi.  Didi.  Sorry. 
[04:12:00]  Didi.  Didi.  What?  Did you have?  I mean, you had a thyroid.  What was the fucking thing you had?  Negamaki disease.  Negamaki.  Yeah.  You had a, so you had that.  Kobayashi Maru.  You had a cookie boot check disease.  Whatever.  So, but were you fat?  Were you eating too out of depression?  Were you fat?  No, no, no.  And no.  That's the whole thing.  So you were fat because of this whole disease?  Yes.  You weren't just jamming pizzas and fucking chips? 
[04:12:30]  No, because if you see pictures before I got sick with a thyroid condition, you're like,  wow, that was you?  Like, yeah.  That, I mean, and then my, one day it just started, like, over a year, I'm like, what  the hell is wrong with me?  And the doctors were, like, putting me through all these tests and then they found out what  was wrong.  So they fixed your thyroid?  Yes.  Now I'm on the medication.  Okay.  So.  So, but do you eat a lot or are you?  No, no.  That's the thing.  You don't eat a lot, but your body's not functioning right because when your, your thyroid's not working,  it's full of sound, your whole process of metabolism. 
[04:13:00]  Thank you.  All right.  So we got a sex talk show.  And I'll talk about the Hashimoto's too.  I don't know.  What kind of sex talk?  What kind of sex talk?  100 uses for cum spicy.  Give me something.  Sex.  How to get the blood from underneath your fingernails.  Ew.  That's just wrong.  Well, you wake up in blackouts.  You know you're fucking scratching whoever's raping you.  No, no, no.  It's more because I am 14 years sober, so I don't wake up in blackouts anymore.  Oh, God. 
[04:13:30]  All right.  You know what?  It was, you didn't get to hear the demo, did you?  Uh, no.  Oh.  Well, yeah.  I guess our name is on this channel.  Maybe we should have listened to the demo.  Yeah.  You guys are just letting people get on their own shows.  Yeah, we don't even listen.  My uncle's doing a show.  Okay, we're next Wednesday.  We don't listen.  Ah, wow.  It's going to be, you know, how I talk with you guys, but it's just in a show form.  Are you done size 14?  Is this going to be... 
[04:14:00]  What?  Are you done size 14?  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket!  See, I take the abuse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...  Yeah.  Because you need us.  What did you say?  She said, good luck with the program.  No, but I really, really, I'm grateful that you guys are letting me do this tomorrow night.  Thank you.  People can call me anything they want, as long as they don't call me late for supper. 
[04:14:30]  Stop!  Come on, now.  Ah.  All right.  Well, sex talk.  Wow.  And more.  And more.  That's the name right there.  Sex talk and more.  Yeah, thank you.  You're welcome, you fat cunt.  Maybe I'll change it.  But what the hell do you know about sex?  I know a lot about sex.  All right.  Well, remember the dominant shit that happened the last time when you guys were here?  Oh, yeah.  She likes to stick dildos up guys' asses, I think. 
[04:15:00]  What the hell is that?  Dildos up guys' asses, right?  What?  Oh.  You stick dildos up guys' asses?  No, no, no.  I've never done that.  No?  But there's always a yet.  Did you stick a finger up a guy's ass?  Maybe.  Let me ask you a question.  Would you lick my ass if I like that?  No, I don't like that.  I did that once.  I don't like that.  Why do you fuck?  You shoot words out like a fucking cannonball.  You gotta stop that.  Because that's gross.  Because I'm like, ah, shut the fuck up. 
[04:15:30]  It wouldn't be gross if he poured some sugar on it first.  Now, what is it?  What about some quick?  If I mix some quick in my asshole, how's that?  And when you get down there, you fucking elephant.  Listen.  Listen.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Yoo-hoo.  Yoo-hoo, chef.  Nice ass.  She doesn't lick ass.  It's the only thing she doesn't lick.  No, that's really... 
[04:16:00]  She poured, bud.  She would lick on an ice cube.  Oh, no, well...  Well, listen.  Yeah, I crashed.  Okay.  Oh, good Lord.  You're gonna try, like, ice block or something.  Listen.  Food!  All right!  She was very bad, he raped, you see?  God.  Try the wine.  This is inconceivable.  Are you a good girl?  Do you go ass to mouth? 
[04:16:30]  Jesus.  I'm a good girl.  And I could be a bad girl.  It just depends on my mood.  Ass to mouth is great.  Ass to mouth.  That's just fucking great.  Ass to mouth.  Oh, that should be a t-shirt.  That should be a t-shirt.  I go ass to mouth.  Hey.  Did you ever lick an ass?  Oh, my God.  Just answer the question.  I told you.  Look, I'm gonna be like a caller, and you have to fucking be on top of it.  Yeah.  I told you.  If you listened to me before, when you asked me that before, I said yes one time, and that's 
[04:17:00]  why I don't do it anymore.  What did it taste like?  Did you get a kidney bean skin on your tongue?  I didn't like it.  Oh.  Because I went, ah.  Hey, do you save one lousy banana for your vag?  Or do you have to eat all of them?  Oh, God.  One lousy.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This is just mean.  That's just mean.  That's mean.  Oh, you know what?  That's, yeah.  You know what?  That's not fair.  No code 3169 was the ass to mouth guy. 
[04:17:30]  I was gonna give you credit, and the fucking screen went by way too fast on Pal Talk.  Hey, did you ever, if, now, if I had, like, if I, if I wanted you to lick my ass, but  I had, like, a bushel of grapes down there.  No, I would not do that.  That I won't do.  No?  No.  Like, like, like a little hemorrhoid, and it was flapping a little bit.  Ew, no.  Just like a little bushel of hemorrhoid grapes.  Would you fucking, would you lick them?  What would it take to lick Bob's ass?  Yeah, would you lick the itch off of my roid? 
[04:18:00]  How about this?  You either lick Bob's ass, or you're one and done with 202.  Boom.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Baby, this is what I'll do for you, too.  I'm going to shave it, I'm going to shave it down.  Bob, would you allow Dee Dee to lick your ass and get another show on 202?  Yeah, I'm not going to do that.  Well, then have fun with your one and done.  Aww.  That's the name of your new show, one and done.  I hope you tape the thing so you can play it 20 years from now.  I would not do that, no. 
[04:18:30]  I can't do that.  But I won't do that.  She's like me, love.  And I'm not talking about the song or singing or anything.  If you call Dee Dee tomorrow night, make sure you go,  hello, hello, am I calling the one and done show?  One and done.  She's like meat and breadcrumbs.  Oh, Dee Dee.  It was so fun to fuck with her.  I'm used to the abuse.  No.  That should be the name of your show right there, used to the abuse.  Used to the abuse. 
[04:19:00]  How's that?  And then people can just call you up and do fat jokes.  You're going to do traffic?  No.  No, no traffic.  No traffic.  Can you do a fat joke segment?  No, I'm not going to do fat jokes.  Why?  Because.  What's your favorite?  You've got to be able to make fun of yourself.  Yeah, you've got to.  We make fun of ourselves all the time.  I made fun of me all day.  Yeah.  Bob admitted he sucks old man cock.  Well, I really was not.  I don't know if we get that far.  Did we admit that?  Wow.  No, I don't think we did. 
[04:19:30]  I think I'll be fucking threw that out there.  I think I was thinking about it and it came out.  I can read faces.  All right?  No, I don't know if it's faces.  Your eyes were a little shifty when you were talking about it.  Apparently, I'm reading old man cock.  That's my forte.  I must say, even thinking about it's a little too much.  Yeah.  Fucking great.  But speaking of traffic, I do have to go soon and do a traffic report.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  For what city?  I do Chicago, Minnie, and Pittsburgh.  Can you say? 
[04:20:00]  For Minnie?  Minnie.  When you do Chicago, when you do Chicago, can't you just throw in a plug for the Opie  and Anthony show on, where are we in Chicago?  W-C-K-G.  W-C-K-G.  I know it's against everything that XM Satellites Radio stands for, but we could use the help  in Chicago.  Let me clear that through with my program director.  Oh, right.  I'm sure that'll work fine.  Hey, can you do something sexy before you leave us? 
[04:20:30]  No.  What do you want me to do?  What do you want me to say?  What do you want me to do?  She sounds like a beaten woman.  Oh, no.  I want you to say.  She likes having her ass smacked, though, with a whip.  Does she really?  Jimmy did it.  With a whip?  The right person does it, yeah.  Why are you going to ruin it?  I know.  Just say you like it.  Don't fucking say it has to be the perfect guy and you have to be comfortable with it.  We get that.  Just say you like it.  You will be molested.  I like it.  Say you like it a lot. 
[04:21:00]  I like it a lot.  Say I like getting my ass slapped.  Just say, ugh.  Fucking ruin every...  I wasn't expecting you to say that.  Oh, my God.  You fucking ruin it with your shitty sinuses.  That is awful.  Sorry.  All right, now go back.  Okay, what did you want me to say?  I wanted you to say, I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it like that.  Repeat after me.  I like it.  I like it like that.  Smack my ass.  Daddy.  Repeat after me.  What?  I want to snort your cum. 
[04:21:30]  Ew.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  It's a beautiful thing.  Say it.  You want to say, I want to snort your cum?  You say it.  It's sweeping the nation.  It's sweeping the nation.  T-shirts are being made by my brother as we speak.  All the kids are doing it.  Yeah.  I want to snort your cum.  But at the end of it, say, I want you to say it like that, but at the end, say, Daddy.  Daddy?  Ugh.  Did you say Daddy or Daddy?  Don't say it like you just fucking came off from school.  Daddy.  Give us a snort, and then we'll go, what was that?  And you go, I'm snorting your cum. 
[04:22:00]  Daddy.  Okay.  All right, give us a snort.  Hey, what's that?  I'm snorting your cum.  Daddy.  You know, at the pause, you could drive a truck through.  What did you learn at X, Steve?  You stink.  It's got to go a little quicker than that, honey.  You got to snort.  Okay, we got to do it fast, because I got to go in deep traffic.  Go, go, go, go, go, go.  What? 
[04:22:30]  I hope you died.  You're supposed to ask me what was...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, you're supposed to snort.  Say, I want to snort your cum, Daddy.  I did snort.  I was waiting for you.  And then say, I snort your cum, Daddy.  Say it.  I'd strangle you with me with my fucking girlfriend.  I'd choke you out.  All right, hurry up.  All right, hurry.  Hurry up.  I just snorted.  Oh, what was that?  Okay, snort.  What was that?  I just snorted your cum, Daddy.  Was that supposed to be sexy?  Okay.  Well, have a good time.  All right, hold on.  Greg on Long Island has something.  Greg. 
[04:23:00]  Yeah.  Dee Dee, one for your new boyfriend.  Fuck me, harder, nigger.  Fuck me, harder, nigger.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  What movie was that from?  I don't know.  Some of the...  What?  Storytelling.  Oh, all right.  Line of the day, so we get out of here.  And then can I play my new song from Luminous 2?  I thought it was Nemo.  Every once in a while, we like to turn you on to a song that we're digging.  Can I play my song today?  Sure.  All right, line of the day.  Three runners-ups? 
[04:23:30]  Yeah.  They're going to all be teeny shit, I guarantee it.  Bodogfight.com sponsors line of the day.  They're doing something over there.  I don't really know what.  It's Bodogfight.com.  What?  All right, well...  Oh, wow.  Who fucked it up?  Who fucked it up?  By the way, we want to give the Pest some air time on this channel.  They just haven't come up with a really good idea yet.  No, can you believe that?  They want to just throw, like, no-filter Paul, Big A, and, like, Denise in studio, 
[04:24:00]  and that's it.  You've got to come up with something, and we'll give you time on this channel.  You know, something different, something unique.  Eat fucking potato chips for an hour.  I don't care.  Just something that's much different than what you usually hear.  And don't call in and say, I'll eat potato chips.  Right.  That was just a really, really, really bad example.  It's called an example.  But you know what I mean.  Like, Dee Dee's show is going to just flat-out stink tomorrow.  Oh, boy.  You think she...  I know the listeners have it in.  You think she got that message?  They're creative. 
[04:24:30]  Yeah, they can come up with something very different that we'd be like, wow, we've got  to listen to this.  All right, here's the first runner-up line of the day.  The reality is no one gives a shit about you and your show.  So you've got to, like, kind of, like, you know, hook them.  You've got to give them a hook.  You've got to give them something like, you know what?  I don't give a shit about this fat pig, but I'm going to listen to her show to see  what it's about because she piqued my interest.  That, you know...  That's funny.  You like how I play the part of the hole?  Yeah, hey.  During that. 
[04:25:00]  Now, now.  I go, oh, now.  I am the hole of the show.  Yeah.  Used to be called Good Cop, Bad Cop.  Now it's DJ Hole.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Oh, now.  Opie, now.  Here's the next runner-up line of the day.  Like, I think the escorts are more Japanese.  They're all the same.  Are they?  Yes.  Right.  They all look depressed.  Who the hell could figure it out?  Let them figure it out. 
[04:25:30]  They all look like there's suns in their face.  I was playing.  Bobkellylive.com?  Robertkellylive.com, yeah.  Robertkellylive.com.  And Robert Kelly Live on MySpace.  All right.  One more runner-up line of the day.  Thanks to bodogfight.com.  I guess you enjoy the big...  Because...  I'm known to have...  What do you like it in... 
[04:26:00]  And the...  You like big...  In your...  What is it sticky?  What is it in your...  You can find a white guy.  I'm sure you'd like it.  But if you like...  Put it in there...  In your...  Then I guess you're doing fine.  That's funny, man.  That bit was beyond brilliant, by the way.  Man. 
[04:26:30]  You haven't heard that yet.  Make sure you listen to the replay today.  That was really good, Ant.  All right.  Here.  And that wasn't line of the day?  No.  That's funny.  That's really funny.  That's all right.  Thanks to bodogfight.com.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here...  Comes...  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day. 
[04:27:00]  My daughters still think that way.  My daughters.  Really?  Maybe you're in the mob.  I'm an actor, honey.  Well...  You know, they're not bringing anything home that you're...  Oh, no.  You're not a great way.  They're not bringing anything that smells different.  Yeah.  Hey, there you go.  Yeah.  I'm getting to the line of the day.  Too long to explain.  You've got to listen to the replay.  If you have no idea what we're talking about.  Holy cow.  Oh, jeez. 
[04:27:30]  We want to go, but Anne-Marie from Cleveland has something.  Anne-Marie.  Hi.  I was wondering...  My boyfriend always fucks me in the ass, and when he does, I end up with hemorrhoids  after a while.  I was wondering if that's what happened to you before, that you wanted him to lick it  off?  Or her to lick it off?  Oh, yeah.  Bob?  Oh, is it?  Do I have hemorrhoids because I got fucked in the ass?  Is that what you're asking?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I never got fucked in the ass.  I have hemorrhoids because I developed a system when I watch TV.  Sometimes my asshole itches, so I itch my asshole and I smell my finger. 
[04:28:00]  And over the years, I think I've developed a hemorrhoid from that.  So hemorrhoids itch a lot, but I've actually kind of...  Sleep better at night, Bob.  I like the itch.  Yeah, the itch.  And then the smell.  I'm kind of addicted to that little fucking musky smell I get from an asshole.  And then I like washing the underneath of that one index finger.  Yeah.  I'm addicted to washing that, like cleaning.  So that's it.  So I never got fucked in the ass, but that's my explanation.  Did that answer your question?  Yeah.  Okay.  By the way, can I plug our site really quick? 
[04:28:30]  A what site?  Nostrn.com.  It's a message board.  No, we're not in competition with anybody.  A what site?  Nostrn.  They are now.  That's how these message boards work.  Wait, I don't even know where to that.  I didn't even get the name, but...  Yeah, you...  Nostrn.com.  N-O-S-T-E-R-N.com.  Oh, there's a panda on the TV, and it's adorable.  Look at it.  Anthony does have a soft side.  I want to scratch it behind the ears and go... 
[04:29:00]  Behind the ears.  Get them every time, Bob.  Every time.  Look.  Look at his little face.  Oh, he can't climb over the log.  It would be great if you should have wrapped it.  Who's this cunt?  Jesus.  You're showing a cute little bear.  Who's this cunt?  Damn it.  Stupid news.  A lot of people want to know if you're going to be going all the way to your house as you're  on the...  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to let you map your way from the studio in Midtown Manhattan directly to my front 
[04:29:30]  door so every one of you psychopaths know exactly where I live.  I'm not going to shut the computer off before I even reach an exit of my house on the expressway.  How bad it didn't suck yesterday when we were in the elevator.  Huge fan of the show.  Some chick with the first iPod that ever came out.  Oh, we didn't talk about the iPhone today.  I know.  The iPhone shit.  Yeah, we got that to be in the news until June anyway.  This girl, the iPod when they first came out, this thing is giant, and she still uses the  first iPod that came out.  And anyway, she's a huge fan, but she's listening to her fucking iPod, so I don't know how that's 
[04:30:00]  possible.  And then basically told Anthony exactly where he lives.  She goes, oh, you live by, and I was like, well, she goes, your house is the one with  the, and I'm like, yeah.  And Anthony, Anthony's all nervous, like, no, no, that's not going to live.  It could be.  Yeah, you got me.  Everyone's saying how great you did today, Bob Kelly.  Oh, yeah.  It was good to be back.  Fun house.  It's fun house.  I'm reading.  Going to go all the way to the house.  Fun show.  I live in a show.  Hey.  We're going to put on another house on Monday. 
[04:30:30]  We'll be here.  Hey, Ron and Fez are up next.  The fact that you're driving home with a camera on you.  I just, I'm experimenting.  I like doing little experiments.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  I know, but you're a fucking grown man.  You have a radio show.  I know.  Just go home.  That's what they tell me.  You have to hook up a satellite, fucking feed, fucking a bunch of dudes.  Everything's all self-contained.  Working the midnight shift, get to watch you go home and swear at a couple black people. 
[04:31:00]  A couple?  All right.  Listen, I want to turn some people on to some music.  If you hate it, go somewhere else before Ron and Fez get on, all right?  But I'm playing this dumb Luminous 2 for the PSP.  The first one had buttery beats.  This one, I think the music's a little better.  And there's a song called Around the World, or All Around the World.  Who sings this?  I don't even know who sings this.  It's just labeled buttery beats and special music, and I was told this was the one you wanted.  Oh, what?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh. 
[04:31:30]  Fan's going to throw something.  Fan's going to throw something, and then he's going to hit Bill in the head.  He's going to do this.  Fan is leaving the studio.  It's just labeled buttery beats, and it's what the U.S.  No, no.  Because this is not a buttery beat.  This has a little, like, Sex Pistols punk to it.  Poor Bill.  The old school punk.  Look at poor Bill.  Wrapped with some of the new sounds of today.  Now he's typing away, looking at the screen.  Just trying to figure it out.  Fucking find it.  Oh, he's trying.  It's like in the Wrath of Khan when they were trying to get the shield back up, and it's 
[04:32:00]  just too late.  I want to know what song he was going to play, because he read my mind.  He just assumed he knew what song I was talking about.  I think he was going to play Shining, the one from the last game.  Oh.  That is a buttery beat.  It's called All Around the World or something like that.  You got it?  Yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[04:32:30]  Opie likes this?  Jesus Christ.  No.  Jesus.  You want to take your shirt off?  This is the fucking song they said he was going to play.  Bill's calling you gay.  Do you take your shirt off when you play Luminous?  Fuck you.  Spin it around your head.  Listen, man.  I'm not sucking old man cock.  Do you like this when you play?  Yeah.  Do you turn this fucking off?  Jesus.  Wow.  Turn it off, because he's getting turned on.  Yeah.  He's filling up.  I got the little, uh, adultery thing.  Damn it. 
[04:33:00]  We don't have it?  Take, try again, Bill.  There's no other Luminous songs, I think, in the system.  Oh, my God.  It's not going to be called Luminous.  That's the name of the fucking video game.  He looks like one of those after-school special actors from, like, the early 80s.  Does it, Bill?  He does.  He does.  He looks like he...  How?  The band's not called Luminous?  Luminous.  Now he doesn't know what to look for, either. 
[04:33:30]  He's just...  I think the title of the song is called All Around the World.  I'm not sure.  Maybe we got a gamer on the line that's playing this Luminous, too, and they can help me out.  Oh, he's sweating so bad.  He's panicking.  He's panicked.  He's looking at the screen.  He just threw his hand up.  Ah, shit.  He's fucked.  All right, just play it.  It's Eric's, uh...  That's probably it.  What?  Now he's trying to blame it on...  Yeah, that's gotta be it, right?  This boat's gonna carry happiness.  This is it.  This is the one Opie would like. 
[04:34:00]  Happiness.  This boat's gonna carry happiness all the way around the world.  Opie, what is it about this that you like?  Yeah.  I don't, um...  This must keep you going, like, when you're almost gonna lose, but then you hear this part?  Yeah.  It's, like, positive.  And it's like, wow, this boat is gonna carry harmony all the way around the world if I  can get this little cube.  Don't forget about happiness.  It's gonna have happiness.  All the way.  Right.  It's gonna fly with the sails under the world. 
[04:34:30]  Wow.  Every boy in the world.  Scott Peterson's song.  This boat's gonna carry my wife and her dead kid.  That sucks.  The baby's still in the belly.  The baby's still in the belly.  This boat's gonna carry Lacey.  Lacey and Connor.  All right.  You know what?  Who's this?  Uh, Crow from Milwaukee.  Oh, oh, it's Stroll Around the World by Star Casino.  Thank you, Jason, from Rye. 
[04:35:00]  Who is this?  Uh, try Stroll, S-T-R-O-L-L, Around the World by Star Casino.  Do we have that at XM?  If, if we don't have this at XM, then they don't know.  Shit.  They don't have it.  Really?  Wow.  Fuck.  Hmm.  Do we have it online somehow?  Or why don't we just go?  Let's go to iTunes.  Why don't we, why don't you just go, go play the game?  Yeah.  Play it, you know what?  Call the show. 
[04:35:30]  Play the game through your phone.  I can play live on the air until I get to that point.  Just play.  Right, I can do that.  Let's just play a game on the air until the song starts.  Brilliant.  It's not fucking Japanese game background music bullshit.  You ass.  Abel from Harlem?  Abel.  Abel.  It might be a bell.  I just panicked.  Are you so panicking?  This boat's gonna carry that fucking song now.  Stuck in your head, right? 
[04:36:00]  Jammed in there.  Jammed in there.  Like Frank Vincent's cock in your mouth.  It is jammed.  Right?  Bob knows.  Jesus.  Bob knows.  Jesus.  Can't wait to fucking see people gonna send me MySpace fucking.  Yeah.  I don't, I don't think anyone's gonna Photoshop pictures of you sucking Frank Vincent's cock.  If you really.  I couldn't picture it.  If the people don't have the talent on Wackbag, the Photoshop thread, there's not enough talent  there for people to actually Photoshop that.  I might have to do it myself. 
[04:36:30]  Why not?  If you really want to piss off Bob, send him pictures of naked girls.  Yeah.  That pisses me off.  Send me photos of your girls' hemorrhoids.  That pisses me off.  Mike Pop can't do it.  Cage.  There's no way he could do it.  No, these people aren't good enough.  They're not talented enough.  No.  The talent isn't there.  I'm sorry.  They don't have the skills.  No.  The skills.  Fuck.  All right.  Wow.  I was really looking forward to this song.  That's not that great.  Now they're thinking about his house. 
[04:37:00]  Fuck you.  This boat's going to carry on happiness.  Happiness.  Happiness.  This boat's going to carry on.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bobby.  Hockey.
