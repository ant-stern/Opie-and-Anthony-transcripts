<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a Shatner-esque intro, followed by the hosts recounting their radio history, including their firing from a Boston station 13.5 years prior and a humorous Opie story about strep throat coinciding with the DC sniper attacks.  They then discussed the dismal performance of the Colts, contrasting it with the Jets' relatively better season, even mentioning a football player who shot himself in the leg and still played well.  The Colts' 62-7 loss to the Saints was heavily ridiculed, followed by a brief mention of Albert Pujols' World Series success.  Opie shared childhood Little League memories, which transitioned into a serious discussion about Travis’s difficult relationship with his mother, who abandoned him and his family. This led to a broader conversation about familial conflicts, even touching upon those of celebrities like Madonna and Mariah Carey. The segment concluded with a BoboCop audio clip.

The next segment started with a fake Taylor Swift interview by Primetime Sam Roberts, highlighting the difficulty of booking A-list guests.  This was followed by speculation on Bill Wyman’s life after the Rolling Stones and his relationships with much younger women. A discussion about a George Harrison documentary led to criticism of Eric Clapton’s personality and a debate about his guitar skills.  This transitioned into a discussion of music preferences, encompassing Regina Spektor, Leonard Cohen, and Joan Baez.  A significant portion focused on Sherwin Sleeves, a musician whose music video "Shepherd of Leaves" was played and analyzed at length, provoking varied reactions from the hosts. Sleeves' background as a public radio worker and stay-at-home father was revealed.  The segment ended with further discussion of Sleeves and previews of upcoming show topics: Occupy Wall Street and a paranormal experience of one of the hosts.

The following segment opened with technical difficulties and humorous frustration from the hosts. A highly offensive trailer for a fictional film, "Livewire," was played.  Jim Brewer shared an anecdote about Lars destroying a knapsack.  The "F.U. Line" segment followed, featuring vulgar listener messages. A major portion was devoted to a scathing critique of the Wisconsin radio show "Rick and Len," from their Jocktober segment, playing audio clips and dissecting their website and Facebook page, which contained numerous offensive and bizarre user-generated content, including references to Chris Benoit's murder-suicide. The hosts launched into extensive, vulgar commentary on the physical appearance of "Rick and Len" and other individuals, including their "news honey," comparing her to Joe Clecko.  This criticism was interspersed with comments about Sam's mother's absent baking, with Paul's mother declared the "key lime pie champion."  The segment ended with a preview of "Rick and Len's" "marquee bit" and a reading from "The Book of Ted."

The next segment continued the "Rick and Len" discussion, highlighting their self-proclaimed title ("the only radio station") and the resulting backlash on their Facebook page, which was flooded with vulgar and offensive comments and photos. The hosts read numerous sexually explicit, homophobic, and racist comments. A phone-in game about differentiating rock bands, racehorses, and porn films was played concurrently.  The conversation veered into tangents about penis size (mentioning Artie Fuqua and Kevin Hart), the decline of radio quality, and Wisconsin cheese culture, prompting calls from Wisconsin residents detailing the state's cheese obsession, including a cheese-filled castle.  A lengthy, poorly performed song parody by Rick and Len about cheese was played.  The hosts continued reading increasingly crude comments from the Facebook page, ultimately leading to the station shutting down its Facebook page.

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment started with Sam Roberts discussing a recurring bit about Mars, their engineer, whose pronunciation difficulties were initially attributed to a language barrier (leading to a discussion about potential racism).  Mars, present in the studio, revealed he has dyslexia. His mispronunciations, including "Sons of Arnicky" and "Chickafill," were highlighted, along with his catchphrase, "Damn, that's a good [blank]". The segment also discussed the listeners' successful targeting of the "Rick and Len" show's pages, showcasing their listener base's power.  The possibility of Mars getting a Twitter account was considered.  Upcoming guests were announced: Brett Ratner, Jim Florentine, and a mystery caller who had never been on the show in studio. A significant portion revisited Travis's strained relationship with his mother, who left the family to be with a Jewish man, with the hosts and Travis engaging in extensive, often crude and offensive, humor about the situation, covering the timeline of events, impact on Travis and his siblings, and his current feelings. A future Thanksgiving special focusing on the mothers of those associated with the show, prominently featuring Travis's story, was mentioned.

[00:03:30]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P. in Sirius 206.  O.P. And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What?  Where did we listen?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's a dang open, Andy, don't listen to the dang open.  Stop with that shit.  And now, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning. 
[00:04:30]  So weird.  Just to say morning to imaginary people.  Yeah, it's like...  You feel like a crazy person after a while.  Yeah.  Who the hell did I just say morning to?  There's somebody out there going, me.  That guy.  Me, you.  That guy.  Right there, you.  Yep, that's the one.  Hi.  Good morning.  Well, they teach you at broadcasting school to imagine your listener.  And talk to that one individual.  Right.  That's so stupid.  We got serial killers and fucking Wall Street executives listening to this crap. 
[00:05:00]  So how the hell are we supposed to imagine one of these made-up people?  One of these fakeries.  It's still one of my favorite things we had to deal with, though, with Dave Douglas.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  And it was a quiz, too.  Post a picture.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  What is the age of the listener you're talking to?  Twenty-four?  Good, good, good.  Meanwhile, we're like, please, with the music you're playing and shit, it's probably 15. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  I think that's what we said at first.  Yeah.  And he's like, no, no, I think if Q's a little older than...  I would go a 16-year-old pimple-faced kid.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  That's not the answer.  All right.  That's not good.  But we're working here.  Okay.  Okay.  They don't buy products.  And that's what it's all about.  And you wonder why he's not in the business.  Yeah.  We try to warn you, Dave.  We really did.  Radio business.  We've been doing it another what?  How many years since that joint? 
[00:06:00]  Wow.  Long time, yeah.  Twelve-ish.  Been a while.  Thirteen-ish years since we got fired from there.  Fuck.  You know what got me?  This morning I saw on the news, it was, I guess, ten years ago that they captured those  DC snipers.  No.  Ten fucking years ago.  That's impossible.  Is it like October 2000?  Oh, maybe nine years.  Really?  Yeah.  But, I mean, it was 2002, I think.  You know how I remember that?  I was, I went to Geneseo Homecoming, and I had so much fun that I came down with a horrendous 
[00:06:30]  strep throat.  Horrendous.  And I was so sick, I stayed in a hotel for a week, I couldn't move.  Oh, really?  And our agent was shipping illegal narcotics.  Oh.  So I could get better.  Now, we were, I believe we were off.  Yes, we were.  Yeah, because I was in, I think I was in Disney World at the time. 
[00:07:00]  When all that happened?  Yeah.  I remember watching some shit.  I remember I needed, I got to explain, because Bob is going to now freak out, but I needed  a Z-Pak desperately.  Yeah.  Because it's the only thing that got rid of the old strep throat.  Yeah.  And maybe someone might have told me he had one laying around, and I said, well, you better  ship that shit pronto, because I'm stuck in this fucking hotel, and I can't even get  out of bed to even go to a doctor, it was so bad.  God, do you have me?  But anyway, what made it great was the whole sniper thing was happening.  Yeah, you were able to just watch it, see what the fuck was going on. 
[00:07:30]  If there's a cool news event going on, you don't give a fuck if you're sick in bed, because  you got something really good to watch, right?  We were fired from Boston 13 and a half years ago.  Wow.  13 and a half years ago.  Sniper caught nine years ago.  Nine years ago.  But it started 10 years ago, right?  And yeah, I guess so.  And we were fired for that, too.  We were fired for the sniper thing?  Yeah, I think we were off, weren't we, in 2002?  Oh, I thought we made some dumb jokes that got us fired for that, too. 
[00:08:00]  No, no, that was the...  I've lost track of the reasons why we've been fired over the years.  Sex for Sam.  No, I know.  I know.  It was just a dumb little...  Yeah.  Those guys were pretty brilliant with the fucking, the trunk and the hole.  Oh, I know, right?  Holy shit, man.  The trunk with the hole, the car, no backseat thing came out.  Holy shit, they had it figured out.  It's like, how do you catch those?  They wanted to snipe some people.  How'd they eventually get caught?  I think Muhammad's ex-wife called?  Yeah, somebody.  John Muhammad's wife, I think, knew it was him.  Yeah.  Somebody called and the jig was up. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, it really was.  Stupid.  End person.  What?  So that's nine years ago they were caught?  Today?  Or right around now?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was actually, yeah.  Did you guys enjoy all the fine football games yesterday?  I just catch the highlights.  I know you're a big football fan, Ant.  I don't know.  I know you're a big Jets fan.  Oh, huge.  Huge Jets fan.  Huge.  Every time they win, I get bigger and bigger of a fan.  Would you become a fair-weather Jets fan if they have a good year? 
[00:09:00]  Please, that bandwagon.  Right.  Hey, please stop here.  I want to get on.  Right now they're kind of just hanging in there.  I think they're, what, 4-3 now?  Something like that?  Yeah, it's a very pivotal time.  You know?  You know?  A couple of wins and they're looking really good.  A couple of losses.  Yeah, but they beat the Chargers.  Chargers are a good fucking team this year, man.  And a little fourth quarter comeback.  Yep.  And Burris finally came to play three touchdowns for that gun-toting receiver. 
[00:09:30]  How do you shoot yourself, like, in the leg?  And you're a football player and you're fine.  And he could still jump 18 feet in the air to catch a ball.  I don't get that.  People get shot in the leg and they're limping the rest of their lives.  Right.  It's like done.  You can't even work at a grocery store.  And this motherfucker shoots himself in the leg.  And he's just like, yeah, yeah.  I'm telling you, he could.  I'm great.  He could jump 18 feet.  I don't get it.  I don't either, man.  It makes no sense whatsoever. 
[00:10:00]  You know where he shot himself?  Obviously in the leg.  But what did he hit?  I don't know.  Obviously he didn't hit any tendons.  Anything.  Because you need those fucking tendons.  That bad.  He was shoving it into his waistband.  So he's lucky he didn't shoot his dick off.  But I'm guessing probably the meaty part of the thigh, not the femoral artery or the bone.  It probably passed right through.  Sam, find out where he shot himself.  Because this kid.  At a nightclub.  The right thigh.  Right thigh.  We know that.  But what did it damage?  Did it just go into some of that meat? 
[00:10:30]  Like I'm saying?  Put it in his pants.  Could have went through like that.  Some meat.  Yeah, no.  He was released from the hospital the next afternoon.  So I think it was just in the meaty part of the thigh.  He might have just nicked himself.  Yeah.  All right.  But Burris had three touchdowns.  And Sanchez only threw for 173 yards.  And most Jets fans are kind of scared that he might not be able to get the job done.  But besides that, the Jets are looking really good.  Yeah.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  And they got a bye week.  So they could kind of chill out and go on vacation or whatever the fuck they do during their bye weeks. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  But my favorite game of the weekend was certainly the Colts because I can't get enough of how bad the Colts are this year and how sad it is to be a fan of that team.  It's bad, huh?  Oh, my God.  And who's a big fan?  What do you mean?  Of the Colts?  I don't know.  Is Travis?  Nah, Travis.  Travis is not a Colts fan.  He wouldn't care about the Colts.  Oh.  You know, you lose Manning.  That's the start of the season off rough, obviously. 
[00:11:30]  Well, yesterday they lost 62-7.  And that's with...  62-7?  62-7.  Wow.  Did he play defense too for them?  Yeah, right?  What the fuck?  That's what someone tweeted last night.  Yeah.  Can't blame Peyton Manning for your fucking defense.  You can blame it for not getting the offense rolling.  But 62-7 and the Saints took out Breeze in the fourth quarter.  What'd they do?  Just took him out?  Let him hang?  Yeah, I think they threw in like the kicker to throw or something for a while. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, something like that.  It's always funny when they do that.  It's pretty degrading to the other team.  Colts had Curtis Painter.  He threw for 67 yards.  Big running game, was it?  Oh my God.  I guess not.  The Colts are as bad as you can be in the NFL.  They're what?  0-7 at this point?  Yeah.  0-7.  They lost 62-7.  Whoops.  So, it's great to watch. 
[00:12:30]  Not if you're a fan, I guess.  You think they'll go winless?  That'd be good.  When was the last time a team went winless?  Has it ever happened?  I don't know.  Wasn't there somebody that, I guess a team was going winless and then they finally won one.  And it's like, why bother?  Just lose all of them so you could be the team that lost the entire season.  Travis might have the info.  He's coming down the hall.  I'm saying the Lions?  Either that or he has a big announcement about his health.  Dolphins did it?  Huh?  Did the Dolphins do it and the Lions?  No, they went undefeated.  I don't know. 
[00:13:00]  We're not that good.  We're not that good at sports talk.  Yeah.  We just give you the basics.  Don't worry about it.  It says here, in 2008, the Lions went 0-16.  Oh, wow.  And then in 82, the Colts went 0-8.  With one tie.  Yeah, one tie.  A tie.  What is 0-8?  That was a strike short.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Oh, see, that's silly.  Yeah, that's dumb.  Yeah, the Lions just a couple years ago didn't win anything.  Huh?  The Lions just a few years ago.  Yeah, that was three years ago. 
[00:13:30]  Okay.  Did you watch football yesterday, Travis?  Of course I did.  What was your game?  My game's tonight.  No, I know, but what game did you have to watch because your team was playing?  I had to watch the Jets and the Chargers because I don't get Red Zone on.  Nice, right?  Jets looking good, right?  Why don't you get Red Zone?  I don't have Time Warner.  I have Time Warner.  Oh, you got that Time Warner cable.  I moved to a building that didn't have Fios.  I got Time Warner.  And I could have Fios.  You should so go.  You're insane.  I have Time Warner in the city apartment.  I have your mind.  In the city apartment.  I get so fucking pissed with that remote and that dumb guide. 
[00:14:00]  The guide is the most basic, unintuitive piece of shit.  The DVR.  And then you're going, you're going, you're going, and the thing freezes.  What?  And then it flips 15 channels because you were pressing the button.  What?  What's wrong with you guys?  I love Time Warner.  You just like to punish yourself.  You have Time Warner.  You refuse to get an iPhone.  My fucking droid rules.  There's more droids out there than fucking iPhones.  You talked about that the first day you bought it.  And you haven't.  I love it.  I love my droid.  I can tell you hate it.  I love my droid.  You hate it.  I love it. 
[00:14:30]  Look at this fucking thing.  Yeah?  You like that thing?  Look, it's nice.  Hey, at least the fucking droid store carries them.  Shitheads at Apple.  I tried to go last night.  I'm going to order it at 9 p.m. and come back tomorrow.  And I order it fucking unavailable in New York.  Why would you have Apple iPhones available in the biggest city in the world?  Why would you?  Yeah, they don't need to.  Do you think they do that on purpose?  They don't make enough to keep the demand up?  I know they do it on purpose.  And it drives me nuts.  It's part of their business plan.  You would think it would drive people to buy other phones. 
[00:15:00]  I'm sure it doesn't, Tom.  Like that.  I hope he holds up his whatever that is.  A droid.  Remember, I introduced a pebble to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's not forget, people.  The pebble that really did nothing.  It looked great, though.  It looked smooth and sleek.  And then you open it and realize, I don't even think there was display on it.  I think just the number came up.  It was like a Jitterbug phone that the old people have.  I need my Jitterbug.  You were jealous for a week or two.  And then you popped up that fucking phone of yours where you could watch live TV. 
[00:15:30]  I was watching live TV.  What phone was that?  Back in the old days.  It was a little Motorola fucking.  Back in the old days.  Phones used to have styluses.  Yes, I hated the stylus.  Oh, yeah.  I had a trio once.  I was always a flip phone guy because I didn't like the idea of ass dialing anybody.  And that was notorious back in the old key days where you'd just speed dial somebody.  I missed the flip phone because you can't hang up angrily with an iPhone. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You could just snap, snap the phone in the back of your car.  Bam!  You can't do that with the iPhone.  That pebble you could throw like a rock.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  You know what was the best thing about that Motorola that I used to be able to watch like Fox News and television shows?  It was the long walk from the old XM building to the parking garage with a master po.  And I used to be able to just flip on the news and put my earbuds in to listen and not have to hear a word he said. 
[00:16:30]  Do you have live TV on your iPhone?  I could get it.  I could have it through Verizon.  So that was pretty special because that was about 2005 maybe?  It was fucking crazy early for live television.  Yeah.  I think it is or was or whatever.  It was very cool if you're like in a stupid like a waiting room somewhere where you're just like sitting around instead of grabbing a dumb magazine or at the dentist.  You could just pop up the fucking one inch square.  Exactly.  You know, it did.  I think it destroyed my peepers, but hey, Charles, what else you got on the Colts game? 
[00:17:00]  62-7.  Curtis Painter threw only for 67 yards.  Yeah, Curtis Painter didn't do a good job.  Saints made it hurt, man.  Yeah.  They were up like 28-0 in the first quarter.  Jeez.  The Colts fumbled the ball like twice in the first quarter.  Oh, my God.  Manning's not coming back this year.  There's no reason to.  I don't think so.  They won't say that he is.  Why would you sacrifice, you know, him getting hurt on a throwaway season?  Cowboys, the thing that happened there, Emmitt Smith doesn't have the record for most yards in the game anymore. 
[00:17:30]  DeMarco Murray ran for a franchise record 253 yards, including a 91-yard touchdown.  I didn't see that.  Fuck.  He was a rookie, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you like, Tebow?  I hate Tebow.  Tebow's going to be an NFL quarterback.  He sucks.  Obviously, he is an NFL quarterback, but I'm telling you, he's going to be respected in this fucking league.  Nobody respects him.  I want respect!  He had a great comeback.  He played for five minutes yesterday. 
[00:18:00]  I'm saying that because Travis was mad.  He's like, he sucked for the whole game in the last five minutes.  Because for 55 minutes, the fucking guy throws for 40 yards, and he was sacked seven times.  All right.  That sucks.  And then he orchestrates, like, you know, two touchdowns in the last three minutes of the game.  And everybody's like, oh, Tebow led his team to victory.  Why do people hate Tebow so much?  I became a fan of his because my nephew went to, you know, he was a Gators fan.  So I'm like, all right, if you're a Gators fan, I'll be a Gators fan for a while.  Yeah, I think, I mean, a lot of people don't like them. 
[00:18:30]  A lot of people don't like how religious he is.  That whole thing.  Yeah.  I mean, that's always going to get you haters when you wear it on your sleeve.  You've got your good boy quarterback and your naughty boy quarterback.  And he's just overrated.  He's not enough of a quarterback.  Who's the naughty boy quarterback, you think?  Because Tebow is obviously the good boy one.  Is there a...  Ben Roethlisberger?  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Oh, come on.  That makes him the good boy.  Goofus and Gallant. 
[00:19:00]  You see Gallant saying a prayer and Goofus has a fucking hammer claw.  I think if you're drowning dogs, it makes you kind of a bad guy.  Might have to give it to Vic there.  So Tebow fucking did it, though.  I mean, over the Dolphins, though.  They're having a rough year, too.  They haven't even won a game yet.  They're having a bit of a rough year, huh?  Dolphins are 0-6.  Dolphins are 0-6.  Colts are 0-7.  Colts are 0-7.  Is that it?  For winless teams?  Or is there a third one?  St. Louis is 0-6.  No, St. Louis is in the World Series. 
[00:19:30]  They're doing good.  No, see, you're thinking of it.  They're doing really good.  They're doing good.  Oh.  What happened?  My ass itched.  I'm just the cheek, not the hole, but it's fucking marvelous.  What?  What?  Stench?  No, no, no.  I just scratched my ass.  Getting a good itch in is nice.  How good is that sometimes?  What, the hole or like the tailbone area?  I felt like the, between, it was in the middle of the ass and the hole, it felt like it was  in the hole, but like when I scratched the cheek, pulling the skin, kind of pulled enough  of the skin back and it did it for me. 
[00:20:00]  There's the many, many ways to scratch your ass.  You want to kind of look in the hole a little bit.  Yeah?  You don't want to go digging like you're looking for fucking Qaddafi.  You don't want to go deep.  In his little rat hole.  You don't want to go deep, but a little itching on the rim isn't bad.  Nick DiPaolo has a great joke about how he wants to get his fucking asshole checked to  the doctor.  Yeah.  And he goes, and he had his finger in there like he was looking for a quarter in a phone  booth.  That's perfect.  I'm paraphrasing and butchering a good joke, but it was very funny.  We're laughing hard.  Such a great description. 
[00:20:30]  That's perfect.  Fucking Nick.  So we did the Cowboys.  We did the Tebow, who Travis is a big fan of.  The Tim Tebow.  Tebow.  You want to say Tebow every time, right?  Yeah.  Or T-bones.  Lions.  Coco.  Yeah.  I guess the only other thing to mention, well, the Bears played in Wembley.  Wembley.  If I call Wembley like a Hulkster in heaven.  Where are you going?  I did this for you.  She worn the shit out of that. 
[00:21:00]  Packers undefeated still.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Goal.  Goal.  Goal.  Goal.  Goal.  Goal.  Goal.  They're the only undefeated team at this point?  That's it.  7-0?  Yep.  God damn.  They look good.  I was watching some of that games during that game, too.  At the gym.  Who do they have at the helm?  Rodgers.  Aaron Rodgers.  Yeah.  Rodgers is making them forget all about that dumb Brett Favre.  Really?  Brett Favre?  If you're Brett Favre, you've got to be like, what the fuck?  Just look like an idiot at this point.  He's hoping this guy breaks his neck.  Oh, man.  Because Rodgers is just making that whole city forget about Brett. 
[00:21:30]  He's won, right?  He's won a Super Bowl at Rodgers.  Yeah.  He gave his MVP, right?  Last year.  Oh, well.  He's a rock star, man.  You going to buy some Packers shares?  Can you?  Yeah, they're putting them back up for sale in December.  Is that good or bad?  Well, they just need to make money.  They're privately owned.  No, but is it a good investment is what I mean.  Well, they never appreciate in value, but you can say that you own.  They never appreciate in value.  But stupid sports fans will do that.  Yeah, I own a team, motherfucker.  I own a team.  I own a team.  It's the only professional sports team where you can buy a share. 
[00:22:00]  So that's kind of cool.  But why don't they?  How much is a share?  $200.  $200 a share?  And you buy one share?  You can buy as many as you want.  Oh, you can?  Yeah.  But what if you buy a majority share?  No, you can't do that.  You own the fucking team.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you start putting in guys like Roger Staubach.  Or you change the name to the Fudge Packers.  Goddamn.  What was I going to say?  Oh, and none of us are really watching the World Series? 
[00:22:30]  What's his score?  Pujol had an amazing game.  That's not how you say his name.  Pujol.  He had a three-homer game like fucking Reggie, right?  Fuck him.  Pujol.  He's very good.  How do you say his name?  Pujols.  Oh, Pujols.  Like Pujols.  Yeah, not Pujols.  Pujols.  But Reggie's welcoming him to the three-home-run club.  Is he?  That's bullshit because Reggie's an asshole.  He doesn't want anyone else in that fucking club.  Oh, no, no.  Reggie.  Especially the guy that's still alive because there's only three guys, right? 
[00:23:00]  Ruth, Reggie, and that Pujols guy.  Pujols.  Wow.  Reggie's were more important, but it's still impressive.  It was the Yankee and the fucking Reggie's.  Well, and it was in the game winning.  It was in game seven.  No, was it, was it?  No, no, no.  It was game six.  Game six, sorry.  I mean, Albert hit him in a, what, 16 to seven win?  Yeah, yeah.  Who gives a turkey?  Who gives a care?  Man, you're a baseball guy, though.  Are you watching or what? 
[00:23:30]  No, I check in every so often, but it's like just seeing guys, I don't know their names  or anything.  I don't have any, you know.  They wear them on the back.  Yeah, yeah.  See, the Yankees don't do that.  If I've never visited the cities, I can't get into it.  The Yankees, baby!  If it was like the Red Sox in it or the Phillies.  Yeah.  Or, I don't know, Washington.  Washington.  I just, you know, I appreciate some of the good plays and stuff.  You know what I'm noticing of late? 
[00:24:00]  They really make some amazing double plays now.  Sure.  You know, it's not just your typical fucking, whoa, look, it's, and they're not very rare.  Like, a game can have a lot of fucking double plays and really good ones.  Those are exciting.  And a triple play, forget about it.  You ever see a ball grounded hard to third or short, and you know it's a double play?  And it's amazing to me, when I played infield as a kid, it's really hard to feel the ground.  Hold on.  What?  It was spinning. 
[00:24:30]  No, that was in the outfield.  Oh, right, right.  They brought you in for a game?  I played in Camp Mason.  When I went to Camp Mason, I played third base, and I was very good.  I was making, like, Greg Nettles, like, diving plays.  I was really a good third baseman.  The problem I had was when a ball was hit hard, a ground ball, just to get in front of it,  that's a hard thing to do.  Like, they make it look like it's such an automatic thing, but if anyone's played the infield knows,  when someone drills a fucking ground ball, and you have to squat and pick it up, ugh,  I'll just move and let it go. 
[00:25:00]  I was always afraid it would hit my face.  It would take, like, a bad hop.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Something like that.  How fast does a ground ball...  It can go over 100 miles an hour.  Really?  Sure, yeah.  For a major league infield.  And those guys, man...  Can you imagine?  Fuck that.  But it's automatic, double play.  It's literally...  It's a back to the right throw, or it's automatic for these guys.  I saw a double play in this series.  Yep.  Guy had...  Guy almost had a tough time getting it around the runner.  You know?  So he really wings it, but he was kind of throwing down. 
[00:25:30]  It took a bounce, like, right in front of the first baseman's glove, where he had his  glove up, and then in a second he had to know to go down and catch it on the hop like that.  That thing would have been in my ball bag if I was even near where it was supposed to  be thrown.  Yeah, but the problem is that the fields are all smooth.  Nice.  That nice dirt.  There's no...  Still.  They should throw...  On a hop like that, and it was a low hop.  It, like, barely hit the ground.  They should throw just a few pebbles in the infield.  Do you think make it a little crazy?  That's how we had to play. 
[00:26:00]  We all were playing Little League.  We were playing Major League Baseball.  We would be fielding a lot more grounders if you were guaranteed it wasn't going to hit  some fucking pebble or something.  Take a weird hop right into your chin.  Oh, damn it.  Crank.  You just smash your jaw together.  No, it is...  Yeah, that sucks.  Obviously, it's amazing, but...  Would you stand in front of a ground ball going 100 miles an hour?  Can you imagine what that looks like?  And then you've got to lay the glove down, put your hand over the top, and hope for the  best, and then it just misses.  You ever do that and have it go to the right or the left of the glove because your aim was 
[00:26:30]  so off?  It's so embarrassing.  But do they not put their hand over the glove like with fucking Jeter or one of those guys?  No, no.  Of course not.  Like it's nothing.  Yeah, they...  But you forget.  The damn ball's going, like you said, close to 100 miles an hour at times, and they make  it look effortless.  That's fucked up.  That's when you can so appreciate what these motherfuckers do, when you realize how bad  the average person is at even just catching a fly ball.  To be able to put yourself under a fly ball and like, all right, I'm set, and the guy 
[00:27:00]  doesn't even move after that.  It's just, here it comes, doink, instead of, whoa, whoa, it's like, come back, whoa, whoa,  whoa, you're all over the fucking place.  Remember it.  It's like, oh, the edge of your glove.  If you even caught it, it's like, hang on, you got the ice cream cone fucking catch.  You've had 20 seconds to get under it, basically. 
[00:27:30]  And at the last second, you're making some weird dive to the right.  It's like, what happened?  I don't know.  I was right on target.  By the way, William in St. Louis brings up a very good point, because Travis doesn't  like the Tebow.  No.  And he writes, Travis's hate for Tebow is misplaced anger for God, you know, because  of mother.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus wasn't good enough to hold your mom's interest.  Nope.  She had to go over to Judea.  That is true.  She did.  She did worship the Christ. 
[00:28:00]  Yes.  Until she got a hunk of rabbi dick.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  Sorry, Travis.  I was so guilty teasing Travis about that.  He always immediately apologized.  I was so bad.  You know what?  It's been 10 years.  But the fucked up thing is, it's like, I was able to goof on Travis early on, before  I really knew him.  Now that I know Travis a lot better, it's like, it's very hard to goof on him about that.  See, I don't know.  It's just the opposite.  It's sweeter now to hurt him.  Is it sweeter?  Why?  I like him the more it feels good to him.  Why?  Because you know it really hurts him? 
[00:28:30]  No.  Does it hurt you at all?  Do you give a fuck?  Yeah, I care.  Because it's so personal.  Very seldomly.  I just realized, like, I sort of patched up shit with my mom, like, barely, like, we're  hanging on by a thread.  And I haven't talked to her in three or four months, so I guess there's a new problem that  I don't know about.  Oh, okay.  Hey, congrats.  Thanks.  Did you do something you didn't know about?  I don't know what I did this time.  I've never done anything wrong, to be honest with you.  She makes up shit in her head.  I don't know what it is.  And I don't give a fuck.  How do you know it's a problem? 
[00:29:00]  Because I haven't heard from her in three or four months.  That you normally would hear?  Yeah, here and there.  Got to call or something?  Especially because, you know, you got a grandkid.  Jesus.  Call for him, at least.  What the fuck?  Yeah, that's usually the thing they do.  I got strangers that fall in love with my son and my own mom.  They're usually on a list.  And my own mom doesn't give a fuck.  Jesus.  It's such a bizarre world to live in.  Damn.  Not to bring everyone down.  My point was, Travis, it doesn't bother you at all? 
[00:29:30]  Sometimes.  Sure.  Yeah, it must.  When?  Holidays?  No, no.  Not even.  Just like random times, I'll be, you know, just thinking.  But it goes away fast, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's sort of where I'm at.  I'm angry for Travis.  Whenever I hear that.  Whenever I think about that, it makes me so fucking angry just for him.  It's more of a...  What about angry for me?  I got some shit going down, too.  At least she tells you why she's, you know...  And let's be honest.  Your mama has issues that you talk about, at least.  Yeah, but at least if she left for some rabbi, like Travis's mom, I would understand. 
[00:30:00]  But you know why your mom is the way she is.  He doesn't know.  Yeah, I mean, the only reason I would want to reestablish contact would be to get answers  from, you know...  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Yeah, exactly.  Like, I don't want her to...  She doesn't deserve...  No.  She doesn't deserve to lay eyes on that lovely little fri...  And you know what sucks is that she can easily Google my name and find out everything that  she needs to know about me because of this show.  Yeah.  Where, like, you know... 
[00:30:30]  Sucks.  Bad producer.  Yeah, exactly.  Almost fired.  Nut kicker.  Apparently, my son went...  Nut kicker.  Apparently, my son has been traveling to a place called Competence because they're always  saying he's in there.  See?  Long way to go.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Travis.  It always goes this way.  But she doesn't deserve to know any of that.  Yeah.  We were having a discussion this weekend because we saw Kramer versus Kramer again.  Can you imagine...  Call himself a nigger? 
[00:31:00]  In, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in person.  The new Kramer versus Kramer.  That ruined him.  Didn't they?  A quick question for Travis.  Now, you're a father, obviously.  Can you imagine just like...  No, I can't.  Thank you.  That's, that's what...  Thank you.  That's what I just don't understand.  That's so fucked up.  I can't imagine one day I'm going, you know, I'm done with this parenting thing.  See you later.  I don't want to deal with this anymore.  I don't get it.  But can you look back...  Especially because you weren't a, like, a problem child.  No.  I can almost see if you were... 
[00:31:30]  We had a great...  A teenager or in your early 20s and you're like, your parents are like, fuck this.  I can't handle the, you know, the issues anymore.  But if you're just a regular, normal type of person, why would you ever leave your kid?  Yeah.  That's fucking...  That's fucked up.  My wife went, went up with, with my daughter to Montreal last week for the entire week.  And I can't, you know, a week is a long time.  I can't imagine just like, you know...  Saying, see you later.  Yeah.  Can you look back and see where your mom might have been nutty though?  Like if you look back as an adult, you can't even see it.  There's no nuttiness in her? 
[00:32:00]  No, you know what?  If, if, if you have to pinpoint it, it's probably around when her parents both, both died.  And then I, she had like a midlife thing, you know, where, where she never dyed her hair  and she started to dye her hair.  How did your parents die?  Yeah, but why can't she have all that and still have...  I don't know.  I'm just, if, if there had to be a switch, like that was probably it.  That was probably it.  That could have put her on the road to being like a hoarder or...  I think Jimmy's right though.  That is more...  Sorry, sorry. 
[00:32:30]  No, that's more fucked up than my situation.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's just confusing.  You don't know, you know, you at least can go, well, you know what?  She's like, your mom is like that with everybody.  It's like, you know what I mean?  If someone's consistent because of whatever they had, they got...  Well, she was consistent with this.  She hasn't talked to her brother or, you know, anybody.  Just fucking dropped out.  That makes me hate that religion too even more.  Like I'm, I'm so anti-religion lately, but that's that orthodox shit in any religion.  Like whether you're a Jew or Catholic or Muslim, you're orthodox.  She didn't go regular Jew either, right?  No.  No, hardcore.  Hardcore Jew. 
[00:33:00]  So what about that guy?  I don't know.  He thinks this is acceptable too, I guess.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure he does.  Yeah.  You gotta convert.  Oh, fucking assholes people are.  Unbelievable.  Do you know where she lives?  Yeah.  Close to you?  Did you just write her a nasty letter?  No.  No.  Oh, no.  No.  Just fucking.  But a couple months ago, I, I looked up.  Send her a picture of your, of your, uh.  Oh, God, no.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't let her see my daughter.  No.  But only to, to really dig at her.  Like, look what you, look at how awful you are.  No, she doesn't deserve to, to see that. 
[00:33:30]  Absolutely not.  Yeah, right on.  Okay.  Or send a picture with the face blacked out and go, this is your granddaughter.  Creep.  You fucking creep.  Sorry, Matt, it's your mom.  I really, I don't, I don't get it.  You don't want to apologize at all.  No, I, I know what state she lives in.  And she blew off everybody.  Mm-hmm.  Everybody.  I'm slowly blowing off everybody.  Are you?  Yeah, slowly.  It's like family?  I got a big family, though, so it's gonna take a while.  Slowly.  It's gonna take a while.  It's gonna take a while.  Just blow off everyone.  Are you doing it one at a time?  Or everyone at the same time, but really slow? 
[00:34:00]  No, just kind of fading out here and there.  Phasing out.  Yeah.  A person here, a person there.  Yeah.  I hear ya.  And if they're homeless under a fucking bridge, don't call me.  Mm-hmm.  Like Madonna's brother.  Although Madonna's brother's saying he doesn't want the help.  Mm-hmm.  Really?  You heard that story over the last night.  That's embarrassing for her, though.  It is embarrassing.  There's only so much you could do for family members.  They gotta help themselves.  It still is, though.  It's just like we're doing Madonna.  I'm not a big Madonna fan, but I get it.  There's only so much you could do. 
[00:34:30]  Only so much money you could throw at siblings, where they have to figure it out for themselves.  They just become an enabler.  Right.  The Mariah Carey sister's like that, too, I think.  Well...  Is she?  She's from the hood.  Oh, she?  From the Harborfields area.  And...  I don't know where she's at these days, but Mariah's sister is a train wreck.  Oh, she was the one...  Didn't she have AIDS or something?  She had all that shit.  Did she?  I don't know where she's at now.  Yeah, I think she's dead.  I have no idea, but...  Maybe... 
[00:35:00]  Maybe she's dead.  I have no clue.  Glad I came in to talk about football.  I know, right?  Are you depressed now?  No.  That's good radio, though.  People can relate to this shit.  That's fucked up.  Look, if I ever talk to her, you guys will be the first ones to know.  Oh, yeah.  My thing is, like, there's a new problem that I don't know about.  But the old days, I would chase and go, oh, what's the...  See, like that...  Okay, what...  Now it's like, whatever.  That, to me, is even weirder than, like, my mom's situation.  Because, like you said, like, she knows that she has, you know, a grandson. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Like I said, people fall in love with this kid as I walk around the neighborhood, and  my own mom's, like...  Yeah, that's a little weird.  Is, like, whatever.  That's the impression I get from that whole thing.  You gotta just cut people off, man.  It sounds terrible.  Like, I mean, not you, just in general.  I used to chase this shit when this would go down.  God, just cut him off.  And call her and enable her and, like, fucking coddle her.  What's the problem?  Oh, and then I would have to take blame for some imaginary fucked up thing that never  happened.  Jesus.  Not anymore. 
[00:36:00]  Ugh.  It's been a couple years now.  Fuck that shit.  Yeah.  Who needs that kind of fucking shit?  So where are we at with the World Series?  2-2.  Yeah.  Yep.  Game five tonight.  We're still Texas, or did they go...  They're in Texas, yeah.  Bush got a standing ovation yesterday, throwing like a girl.  Did he?  I don't know.  Bush doesn't really throw like a girl.  He's pretty bad, too, man.  He's one of the better ones, though, because he owned the fucking team.  Show me the pitch.  Did you see Jim Jeffries throwing the pitch out?  Oh, no. 
[00:36:30]  No way.  Is it online?  Yeah.  No way.  Let me see that one.  It's not good.  Really?  Yeah.  Jim Jeffries gets heckled after awful first pitch at Wrigley.  Wow.  How long ago is this?  A couple months?  Yeah, just a few months ago.  He's reporting tonight at the Park West.  This is where we post-present TV is just for the last year.  Wow.  The festival.  Oh, man.  Please love the Australian comedian, Jim Jeffries.  Jim Jeffries. 
[00:37:00]  No one gives a shit.  Oh.  Oh, this is so great.  Oh, no.  All right.  He's on the mound.  He's trying to set the zilch.  Oh.  Nice one.  Good arm.  Good arm, Aussie.  Oh, my God.  He can't throw a baseball.  It was way over his head.  That's the way he's trying to set his arm to the real pitch.  It's like, all right, all right.  One.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got this. 
[00:37:30]  He's probably got the fucking DTs.  Oh, my God.  What did he do wrong?  He probably drank until five minutes before that.  It was probably half.  I think he released it before his arm started going forward and then was able.  Yes.  Is that what happened?  Like some stupid cricket game.  He released it when his arm was still above his head.  Way up and to the, uh, to the whole alley.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that an awful, awful pitch?  Is he gay? 
[00:38:00]  He just throws like it.  What about, uh, George W?  Now, let's look at George W. Bush's.  Well, you know, you gotta look at a bad one and then look at one that's.  Jim Jeffries, that could be the worst first pitch ever.  That's a bad one.  Della Bate had a pretty fucking bad one.  That was really bad.  True, but I think Jeffries might have beat that one out right there.  That, yeah.  Jeffries had a really bad one there.  Uh, George Bush.  We got a, we got somebody on the line.  My wife's mom fucked her boyfriend when she was 17. 
[00:38:30]  Hey.  This is when?  Wow.  Game 4?  Oh, this is.  Goddamn.  George W.  George W's in shape.  Ah, it's a little weak.  You know, it makes it right there.  The form's okay.  It makes it there.  He's not gonna throw his arm out.  He's not a kid.  Who'd he throw it to?  Nolan Ryan.  Nolan Ryan.  Oh, the president.  Who's just looking worse and worse as the years go by.  Well, I mean, age will do that, but he isn't starting to look fucking bloated or something.  Oh, boy.  That means his arteries are starting to shut down. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, fluid retention.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Yump and yiminy.  Well, there's a lot of fucking.  That wasn't that bad, Ant.  A lot of energy around an ex-president.  A lot of.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of movement.  A lot of movement.  A lot of movement.  Let's take this one phone call, and then we'll move on.  Who's this?  Justin.  All right, you got a quick story, buddy?  Yeah, fucking my wife, when she was 17 years old, her dad had just barely got home from work, 
[00:39:30]  and fucking phone rang.  He picked up the phone, and the parents of her boyfriend at the time had called and said,  you need to come over here and get your wife, and he didn't know that the daughter was downstairs,  and he says, well, is she there to get my daughter?  She says, no.  We walked downstairs, and she was down.  I'm going to hang up on her.  Cut the losses, right?  I was feeling that loss cut, too.  I was.  I couldn't keep up. 
[00:40:00]  Well, apparently what happened was, as he was dating somebody, the girlfriend's parents  called his house, and his dad picked up.  His mother apparently was fucking the daughter's boyfriend.  The daughter's boyfriend.  This guy's married.  His wife's mother fucked her boyfriend.  Yeah, but why didn't he say it like...  Because he was walking through what happened.  He was going, he was just rambling on about details that were unnecessary.  There was too much character development.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:40:30]  I was scared.  Didn't need that.  Didn't need that.  That's an action movie.  We don't need a lot of character development.  It was too much like Airport 75, where the first hour is everybody getting to know each other.  The first hour is, oh, there's the comic relief.  There's the old person.  There's the macho guy and the pilot that's fucking the sexy stew.  The relationship problems.  Right, right, right.  The problem the guy has at the airport.  We get it.  You have a family.  And George Kennedy.  We get it.  George Kennedy had to wait until like Airport 25 to work his way up to pilot.  Those disaster movies were ridiculous. 
[00:41:00]  Irwin Allen's formula.  Because the actual disaster was only five men, so he needed all this time to waste.  So it was always character development.  What was the one with Robert Reed?  He played a pilot that wouldn't go down, which is ironic, of course.  That is ironic.  But the plane wouldn't go down.  It was stuck in...  Call them old Jetway ass.  I always wanted to see it, but there was something on a plane where the ascent, it couldn't stop ascending.  Oh, okay. 
[00:41:30]  You got me on this one, Jim.  And he was the pilot.  I do remember that one.  And I want to know what it was.  Was that an airport movie, or was that like some other airline disaster?  I always wanted to see that, because that's my greatest fear, was just to be in an air balloon or something and continually going up.  And it just keeps going and going.  Until you see black, and then you run out of air.  Robert Reed.  Oh, I had another...  Fuck, I didn't write it down.  I wrote it a little bit down, but I had another awful dream.  It's called International Airport, by the way.  Could you save it for after the break?  Yeah, I don't remember much of it.  Oh, break.  But you might remember during the break. 
[00:42:00]  No, it was a few days ago.  And his name's really Poo Holes?  Yeah.  Poo Holes.  That's funny.  That's like a bunghole.  Well, I try to, like, kind of...  I don't think he wants to be known as Poo Holes.  He's the best player in the game.  Poo Holes.  Poo Holes.  Poo Holes.  No, Holes.  Poo Holes.  There's no way that's his name.  He has a cousin. 
[00:42:30]  And his name is Harry.  Harry Holes?  Yes.  Harry Holes, Opie.  Harry Holes?  No.  Well, how would you say it?  Harry Poo Holes.  Harry Poo Holes.  Harry Poo Holes.  Yeah.  Sally Kramer?  Yeah.  I know, we should play that to break, but instead we're going to do Brian Regan in Little  League, I guess.  Hey, let's do that.  That's a good one.  Oh, my parents didn't know what to do with me.  They got me in Little League baseball.  I played out in right field because I stunk. 
[00:43:00]  But you don't know.  You just show up, you know.  I got my glove.  You any good?  I don't know.  My mom told me to come out here.  We'll get out in right field.  Okay.  Turn around, you moron.  Oh, okay.  Not the whole way.  Oh, only some.  Some way.  I never knew what was going on out in right field.  All I knew is at the end of the game, I'd get a free snow cone.  That's all I knew. 
[00:43:30]  Be out there.  Oh, free snow cone.  Free snow cone.  Brian, what's the score?  Free snow cone.  Free snow cone at the end of the game.  If you play, they're going to give you a free snow cone.  Even if you play half game, you get the whole.  You don't get a half snow cone.  You get a whole snow cone for half the game.  The people that play whole game get a whole snow cone.  And the people that play half game get a whole snow cone. 
[00:44:00]  So it's always whole.  Always whole snow cone.  So I'd rather play half game.  I'd rather play half game.  Still get the whole snow cone.  How many outs, Brian?  Grape.  You're going to get grape or cherry.  They're both favorites.  So either one is good.  If they have both, I'll get grape, though, because that's a little more favorite.  But if they don't have grape, it's like, oh, that's fine, because cherry's favorite anyway. 
[00:44:30]  It's like another favorite, but not as much.  Not as much favorite.  But they're both good.  They're both good.  All right, Brian, you just have fun out there.  Okay.  The second baseman would give me signals to get me involved in the game.  You know, he'd like, you know, put his outside fingers up.  Okay, Brian, got two away.  Two away, Brian.  I don't know who he's talking about. 
[00:45:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Brian, two away.  You two.  And our coach would yell from the dugout every now and then, you know.  Hey, guys, let's hear some chatter out there.  Let's hear some chatter.  What are we, rabbits?  What are we, rabbits? 
[00:45:30]  Might as well have been, you know.  Chattering is saying, hey, batter, batter, over and over again.  I don't think I ever felt like more of an idiot in my whole life.  Out in the field going, hey, batter, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey.  Hey, batter, batter, batter.  Hey.  Hey, coach, is there a point to this?  What is that for the batter's benefit?  Hey, batter, batter.  Hey, fielder, fielder. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, batter, batter, batter.  Hey, fielder, fielder, fielder.  They're communicating.  And as the ball got to them, we're all supposed to lean in and go, hey, batter, batter.  Swing.  Like, he couldn't get a hit when he yelled that.  Oh.  It's like swinging up.  Did you hear what they yelled, coach?  If that's fair, they should do that in all adult sports, you know.  I'd like to see that out in the golf course.  You know, hey, golfer, golfer.  Golfer. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, golfer, golfer, golfer.  Putt.  Putt, golfer.  It's right there.  Putt.  What the hell's the matter with you, Ralph?  I'm just trying to make it fun.  Why do you learn that?  Are you supposed to apply that later in life?  Hey, lawyer, lawyer.  Hey, lawyer.  Lawyer, lawyer.  Hey, lawyer.  Sue.  Sue, lawyer.  Bus driver, bus driver.  Drive, drive.  Shift, bus driver.  What the hell's the matter with you?  I learned that as a kid. 
[00:47:00]  He's just applying it.  The only compliment I ever got in Little League Baseball was, good eye, Brian.  Good eye, Brian.  Yeah, hell, thank you.  Good torso.  So, I noticed you during the trunk rotation.  Good eye, they would say that when you're too scared to even consider swinging the bat.  The ball would graze your head at about 100 miles an hour. 
[00:47:30]  Ah!  Good eye, Brian.  Oh, thank you.  What did I do?  You moved your head of the way of the fastball.  Oh, good, good.  I'm glad I did that.  I almost didn't, but then I did.  Go, team.  Go, team.  Go.  I used to get scared getting up to bat.  And what made it worse was the kids out on the field on the other team.  I don't even know these kids.  And they're all out there yelling, easy out, easy out.  Everybody move in.  Easy out. 
[00:48:00]  How do you handle that when you're nine years old?  Hey, they're walking towards me.  The outfielders are playing in on the clay.  The infielders are going through my pockets.  Easy out.  Easy out.  I'm like going, hey, that's my gum.  I played softball this last year. 
[00:48:30]  I struck out in slow-pitched softball.  Let me tell you something.  It's not a whole lot more humbling in life than striking out in slow-pitch.  Walk back to the dugout.  You know, your teammates are older than Little League.  They try not to laugh, but it's kind of hard not to.  You know, you sit next to them, they're going.  What can they say?  Wow, he throws a wicked 12-foot arc.  It's hard to hit in only three tries. 
[00:49:00]  It should be a bigger ball.  It should be a kickball.  We should play 10-strike kickball.  You know, that's what it is.  They call it softball.  It makes it sound like it's harmless, you know.  You ever take a line shot to the face with a softball?  You don't go, hey, that's downy soft.  That was like a big ball of cotton.  Hey, don't worry about that.  That's blood light.  We're playing softball.  We're all going to float around like angels.  What we have here is the best of both worlds. 
[00:49:30]  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer, onboard memory, and 30 years of human  experience and interaction.  BoboCop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law, and to jerk off in a toilet,  all right?  Part man, part robot. 
[00:50:00]  Complete imbecile.  Alive or dead?  Dead or alive?  You're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid.  Eat a bowl of dick.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area. 
[00:50:30]  K9 units, please respond.  We have a 16-3 in progress.  All right, let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  BoboCop.  Who is he?  What is he?  I suck.

[00:51:00]  BoboCop.  The O.P. Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get.  Big-time music star,  pop and country music sensation, 
[00:51:30]  Taylor Swift.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Taylor Swift.  Taylor, do you like grapes?  Absolutely.  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get  on the O.P. Anthony Show.  Series M.  This is the O.P. Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  It's all right.  Is this one of E-Rock's themed rejoiners? 
[00:52:00]  Is it an E-Rock themed rejoiner?  Sponsored by...  They're going to sponsor this, I bet.  Holy shit.  E-Rock's themed rejoiners.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Brought to you by LARN.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  What happened?  Now, Bill Wyman is 75 today?  Yeah.  Holy shit, man.  My dad, if he was alive, would be 81  and I consider, when my dad died,  I considered him an old guy. 
[00:52:30]  75?  Bill Wyman's an old guy?  That's an old guy.  Why did he leave the Stones?  Because he was an old guy?  No, no, when?  It was the 80s?  Oh, when?  I'm sorry.  85?  Fuck, dude.  Was it during the Steel Wheels tour?  Bill Wyman made it into the 90s.  Oh, absolutely.  Steel Wheels want you to buy him something, right?  You know what I'm saying?  Exactly, Chip.  Oh, exactly.  He was too busy getting very young pussy.  He didn't want to deal with mixed bullshit anymore  when he had young pussy waiting for him at home.  Pussy.  Pussy.  He left in 92. 
[00:53:00]  Wow, really?  For 20 years he retired.  Think he's set for life?  I imagine.  What do you think?  Could have a couple of dollars.  You think so?  A couple of shekels.  He left with 64 to say 63.  You think he's set for life?  If he's 75, his life is, you could have 20 bucks and be set for life.  He might have 10 good years left.  That's it.  Yeah, I guess he got bored.  Well, what are you going to do after a while, right?  Yeah, I mean, maybe he just wanted to relax and get blown.  He married or had that very young girlfriend, and then his son went out with the mom or something? 
[00:53:30]  With the mother, yeah.  What the hell's going on over there?  They're bored.  They've done nothing but fuck whoever they want, so now it's just fun to pick up positions.  Find some weird shit.  Yeah, you fuck the quarterback, I'll have the quarterback eat my ass.  It's not even about the people anymore.  What do you think Ravi thinks?  I don't think Ravi would like that very much.  Ravi.  Ravi.  So I asked Ravi.  Took me out of the fucking movie. 
[00:54:00]  When I was talking to Ravi.  No, no.  Ravi.  There it is, there it is.  Ravioli.  Just how he said Ravi.  I still didn't watch the last half hour of that.  Ah, that documentary was good, but it bothered me.  I want to know about his son.  All of a sudden, George Harrison's son pops up in the documentary.  Like, is he a musician?  Ah, fuck his son.  Yay.  I couldn't agree more.  Does anyone know anything about George Harrison's son?  I mean, they did his interviewing in front of a bunch of guitars, so obviously the guy's a musician. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  So, um, how hateable was Clapton?  Someone tweeted that yesterday, like how much they hated Clapton and that.  We have talked about how much.  He really didn't come across one.  What a fucking dude.  I, by the way, congratulations me, because I've been slamming that prick for fucking years.  Clapton?  Little pat on the back.  Can't stand him.  Yeah, he's a dick.  What a douche.  And I don't even think he realizes that he came across as a dick in the documentary.  No, of course he doesn't.  Clapton is God.  He tried to explain how he stole Harrison's wife, like it was no big deal, because it was 
[00:55:00]  the summer of love.  Free love.  Free love and...  What?  Frick.  I think it kind of hurt.  Yeah.  Think you'd mind if I did that to his wife now?  Exactly.  I'm sure she'd mind, but you think he wouldn't?  Yeah, she'd have a problem.  Sure, sure.  Who isn't afraid of a pistol?  But Layla is still an amazing song.  Jimmy doesn't like the Layla.  It's okay?  I like the Layla.  It's okay.  I just think he's very remarkably overrated.  No, you can't say that.  Remarkably overrated.  You can say he's a dick.  Yes.  As a person, but I don't think he's overrated. 
[00:55:30]  I think he's remarkably overrated.  Look at that.  That's a very good guitarist.  A great guitarist.  Could be the greatest riff of all time right here.  No, it's not.  Exactly.  It's like a Santana riff.  You can't just say that.  Fucking bunch of Zs.  You give me a fucking Into the Void, I'll take Iommi over him any day of the week.  When you hear that riff, you don't get all pumped up, all juiced up. 
[00:56:00]  Not at all.  Maybe get a couple goose bumps on your arms like, fuck, turn this off.  And the end of the song in Goodfellas.  Yeah, it was.  You got to like the Layla.  You have to like the Layla.  It's okay.  Just okay.  You like any Clapton songs?  It's too long.  I'll give you that.  The song's too fucking long.  No, but it's the era, man.  Do I like any Clapton songs?  Well, we had Tears in Heaven, I like.  Yeah.  Those were the days when you didn't have a smartphone, so you could sit through a seven-minute song. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  The attention spans a little short these days.  I'll tell you what I've been enjoying for the last 20 hours, because I'm not caught up with Boardwalk Empire.  I just finished episode three.  And I love when shows use a cool song at the end, and they fucking, Regina Spector did a cover of My Man from like 1920s, and they used that at the end of Boardwalk, this, Boardwalk Empire this week.  Or last week.  It was fucking great.  I like when you pick songs.  Can we play that?  My Man, it's a cover.  Barbara Streisand did it in Funny Girl, which I didn't like her version. 
[00:57:00]  You fruit.  Fucking.  Billie Holiday did it.  First of all, who is Regina Spector?  She did that song.  I can't remember the fucking.  My Heart, whatever the fuck it is.  Okay.  It's a pretty big song.  Wait, can we play the single for the people?  The riff?  No, the other one that Jimmy's talking about.  The one that.  Yeah, My Heart.  Into My Heart.  I think it's called some shit.  Yeah.  I don't remember the name of it.  That's all I remember is that dumb stutter lyric. 
[00:57:30]  Dwayne Allman wrote that riff for Clapton.  Well, Dwayne Allman was a fucking animal.  Well, he's dead.  So he's not hearing you right now.  Did he really?  I heard Dwayne Allman was just a fucking, the shit.  Helped everybody out.  He was that damn good.  What are you doing, Sam?  Yeah, what's happening?  Just find my man.  I didn't know he did the Clapton riff, though.  So he did isolate that.  I want to hear the single.  You got it, E-Rock?  This is Sirius XM.  We must have it.  Yeah, I was spelling her name with a C. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, it's S-P-E-K-T-O-R.  What's the song called again?  I don't remember the first one.  The new one is My Man, but it's on the Boardwalk Empire.  It was her big hit.  Her big hit, Regina Spector.  Okay, that helps.  Oh, boy.  How about Regina Spector hit?  I think there's a lot of Regina Spector in here.  Fair enough.  That's what I'm trying to find.  You got it?  I mean, this must be it.  Oh, sure.  This is the one with six, whatever, million views.  Just turn it up.  That might be it.  Well, it's commercial, I guess.  Good golly.  It's called Fidelity.  Well, this isn't the song. 
[00:58:30]  Dan Central 2.  Ooh.  Dan Central 2.  That sounds horrible.  Who wants to go to Dan Central?  Fuck no.  Oh, fucking boo.  This better be it.  This is it.  I just talked about the end of the song.  Fidelity.  Oh, okay.  Fucking love that voice.  Yeah, she's good, man.  A lot of the broads have that voice.  Airy.  I don't know if she looks like that.  Yeah, I love it.  And by protecting my heart, truly, I got lost in the sounds I hear in my mind. 
[00:59:00]  All of these voices I hear in my mind.  Not too hot, huh?  Where is she from?  She's a little rough looking.  I hear in my mind.  Really?  It's so weird.  She's funny, too.  Yeah.  And it breaks my heart.  And it breaks my heart.  If you listen to this, Jimmy.  This is the only song by her.  I like this one song by her.  And it's because an ex-girlfriend of mine turned me on to it. 
[00:59:30]  This one song only.  What does it like?  The cover she did at the end of Boy Walk Empire.  Not this.  I don't mind this.  It's okay.  What is an ex-ex-girlfriend?  Not my most recent ex-girlfriend.  My ex-once-removed.  Ah, that's a good way to put it.  Okay.  I thought it might be something really bad that happened.  No.  You want to stress how ex it is.  Oh, no.  Ex-ex-ex-ex.  No, it was just one or two removed.  She's a triple ex-girlfriend.  So the new one she covered.  And I listened to the original.  Fanny Bryce did the original.  Fanny Bryce. 
[01:00:00]  But it was too slow, the original, from the 20s.  I liked her version better.  This was at the end of...  Boy Walk Empire.  Yeah, they play some cool shit.  Check it out.  Or at least a little bit of it.  Yeah.  So far, I like it.  Yeah, it's not happening, Sam.  My man, don't treat me right.  Don't kiss me sweet goodnight.  Is this it?  Don't buy me flowers to smell why he's a rotten boy from hell.  My man, don't treat me good.  Maybe she reworked it. 
[01:00:30]  That's not the song?  It says my man right there.  Yeah, but the Boardwalk Empire version is a little different.  Try this one.  There's music in it.  Yeah, I think so.  Sounds boardwalking.  Yeah.  Sounds old school, right?  It's cost me a lot, but there's one thing that I've got.  It's my man.  I'm just looking at Ant.  I start staring at you. 
[01:01:00]  I'm like, I don't think Ant's going to dig this one.  No, probably not.  No, I like that.  I kind of like it.  I like the oldie time music.  I picked up some weird likes at the end of shows like this.  Sopranos is good for that shit.  They turned you on to some good songs, right?  I still like the captain, although Ant wanted to fucking kick me in the larynx for enjoying  that one.  He isn't true. 
[01:01:30]  He beats me too.  Nice.  What can I do?  Ah.  Oh, my man.  The good old days.  I love him so he'll never know.  They do.  All my life is just despair, but I don't care.  Is he a foreigner?  I don't know.  When he takes me in his arms, the world is bright.  You know another song I liked that was?  It was at the end of fucking, what was the Robert Redford movie about the assassination 
[01:02:00]  of Lincoln?  It was kind of boring, actually.  It wasn't that great.  Jesus, dude.  No problem.  It was recently.  The Conspirator.  The Conspirator or something.  The Conspirator, yeah.  And there's somebody named, do you know who, I never would know who he was, Ray, oh, you  could call him Ray.  He doesn't have to call him.  Ray Monta, and that's not Montague, is it, someone's screaming at the radio right now.  Ray. 
[01:02:30]  Usually the name pops up, somebody.  Somebody.  Montane?  Yeah.  I kind of dug him a little bit.  Yeah.  Into that movie.  I like a good soundtrack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like a good soundtrack.  By the way, can I, I never knew Leonard Cohen sang the Sopranos theme.  Oh, really?  Never knew that.  No?  Never fucking knew that till last night.  Why?  Just didn't.  Why last night, though?  I was, I saw, I was looking at something on, you know, you fucking digress on iTunes and  you go all, and I saw the song, I didn't realize Leonard Cohen, I saw online, he sang 
[01:03:00]  it.  I love everything he sings, but I don't have any Leonard Cohen in my house.  But for some reason, I love everything he fucking sings.  I like the two from Natural Born Killers are the ones I have.  I thought this was him.  Fuck yeah, man.  I like this song more now.  What was the song of Natural Born Killers again?  I haven't thought about it in a while.  It's a great song.  The main one.  I like the last one better.  It's the, Waiting on a Miracle is the opening. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  And the last one is fucking, it is murder.  Yeah.  I can't remember that one.  That one.  That's when the credits are rolling, right?  Yeah.  There's a longer version of that than the movie has.  Like, his version is longer.  I think that was the one when the credits were rolling.  You're like, holy fuck.  Nah, nah, nah.  I can hear a, uh.  Give me some Cohen, man.  From Natural Born Killers.  Yeah, the last one.  Not a big Cohen.  La Montaigne is his name.  Why don't you like Leonard Cohen, man?  What is that?  What is that?  I like it because it's, you know, it's kind of hearing it every week for years. 
[01:04:00]  You kind of go like, all right.  It's not poppy enough for you?  No, I don't get it.  I don't get listening to some guy.  You like your music, I've noticed over the years.  I do like uppy music.  Although you like Alice in Chains, and that's some dark shit.  That's like dark.  But the harmonies help that out.  Yeah.  And I like oldie music and shit.  I was watching Paper Moon over the weekend.  I watched Paper Moon.  And, um.  Yes?  How do you deliver the moon like it's a newspaper?  Paper Moon. 
[01:04:30]  No, not that.  It's.  Oh, God.  Sure.  And they got like oldie time music, and that is the soundtrack.  It's pretty good.  Right.  That movie's great.  I never saw it.  Tatum O'Neill?  The directing.  Yeah.  Paper Moon?  Paper Moon's a great.  It's a really well.  Peter Bogdanovich directed it.  It looks fucking amazing, that movie.  It's black and white.  And, um.  It was Tatum O'Neill's first movie, I guess.  Why is it good?  I don't think I've ever seen it.  Because there's like a, there's a great, uh, dynamic between her and her real father,  you know, in the movie. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, right.  It was her first role.  Uh, and she's fucking great.  Like, you can tell.  Yeah.  She won an Oscar for it.  You can tell.  You're watching it.  It's just going, how the fuck do they get a kid to act like this?  And, um.  I guess it was the last thing I ever saw him that, that was, he was good in.  And it just had a great feel to it.  The way it was directed and shit.  It really looked like, uh, Depression-era kind of, uh.  Uh, uh, Prohibition-era shit.  I'm going to have to check it out.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  It's an old fucking movie, but.  By the way, Regina Spektor from Russia. 
[01:05:30]  Thank you, my friend.  Oh, she is a Russian?  Yes.  And the future is the song we're talking about.  I dance for you on this.  From National Board of Killers?  Yeah.  Someone is saying it's not Leonard Cohen.  The band is A3.  Oh, maybe it is.  Okay.  What, from The Sopranos?  It's Leonard Cohen.  I'm very confused now.  Leonard Cohen?  No.  Oh.  Alabama 3 wrote and sang The Sopranos.  Oh, boy.  What?  It has nothing to do with Leonard Cohen.  Then why did I see him online with his, uh, the credit?  Oh, maybe there's a version of him doing it?  He may have covered it, but it's not him.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  And some people say that his song Democracy sounds a lot like it, so it might have been 
[01:06:00]  influenced by that, but he definitely did not sing.  I was just with Jimmy on that one.  I just assumed it was Leonard Cohen.  Yeah.  It's a good impression of Leonard Cohen, no?  Sure.  All right, turn this up.  This is great.  Give me a crack in your sex.  Take the only tree that's left.  Stub it up the hole in your culture.  That's a great line.  Is it?  Yeah.  It gives a shit. 
[01:06:30]  Listen to this crap.  How's it going, man?  That's a genius.  It's coming out with a new album next year.  I see it.  Really?  It is.  Yeah, first album.  How did anyone hear this and go like, yeah, that's the sound.  It's his voice.  It's great.  His voice stinks.  I love the voice.  It sounds like somebody with laryngitis and fucking emphysema.  I love the voice.  But I don't like a lot of his stuff.  I like the two from Natural Born Killers and not the Sopranos theme song.  Have you heard Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen? 
[01:07:00]  I don't think I can hear a little bit.  Oh, the fuck is that good?  I don't think I like him as much as these two.  I like this.  He's an amazing Canadian singer.  Fuck off.  I like it.  Cohen is a very interesting individual.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  What has he done?  That's interesting.  He went away for a bunch of years and trusted his money to someone who he probably shouldn't  have and came back and it was all a gun.  Oh, boy, was a gun.  So he's an asshole.  Yeah, he's a dummy.  All right.  That's good.  That's why he had to tour two years ago.  Yeah.  As he was falling down on stage. 
[01:07:30]  Well, he's not lightheaded anymore.  He's going to have an album next year.  He's good.  He's good now.  He's good.  The fourth, the fifth, the minor, fall, the major, lift, the baffled.  You're tapping out?  This is terrible.  Just terrible.  It's still building.  No.  Give it a chance to build.  Here we go.  What is this?  Fucking church?  You don't like some of that gospel shit?  This is horrible. 
[01:08:00]  Are you a fan of the Saints Come Marching In?  I would not be able to turn this off fast enough.  All right.  How about this?  Do you like fucking a great song?  Who is that lady?  The great Sophie Tucker.  No, wait.  What the fuck's her name?  Bob Dylan used to fuck.  Oh, Joan Baez did a great version of Amazing Grace.  Oh, you don't like that version?  I hate Joan Baez.  That fucking folk singing.  I've always hated Joan Baez for some reason.  No, but her version of Amazing Grace is great. 
[01:08:30]  I'll have an open mind.  Give me the Joan Baez.  She sings.  This is Jimmy's Music Hour.  Yes.  But this is just obscure weird or weird things I like.  That's fine, though.  But since it was gospel.  We always do our Music Hour.  Let's do Jimmy's Music Hour.  This is Amazing Grace by Joan Baez.  Well, Joan Baez might not like her music, but boy, what a looker.  Yeesh.  I don't know this version.  Push your eyebrows and Sam in that picture.  Yeah.  I don't know this version.  But do you know the push that's probably on that lap?  Wait, we want to go studio?  No.  It was a live version.  I just don't know if this is it.  All right.  Maybe it is. 
[01:09:00]  This is your Woodstock, and it's long overdue.  Yeah.  Maybe you should zip through a little bit.  No.  Some of her babble.  No, no.  You've got to hear her inane babble.  Oh.  The money out of your pockets will go to food to feed hungry children.  Boo.  She always has a cause.  She always had a cause.  Yeah, this is not the version I've heard.  I never was a fan of Joan Baez.  I don't know why. 
[01:09:30]  What?  What happened there?  She used to be a lot of people sing along.  The album version is very good.  I've never heard this.  Why do I keep saying that?  You like a wretch.  You heard me.  She is a wretch.  You like Joan Baez?  Yeah.  Why are you going to save a wretch?  Why not just put it in a thing?  That's a wretch, Chip.  Save a screwdriver or something.  What's the other one you like about the diamonds?  Diamonds and Rust is great.  Priest Cues, Priest covered it.  That's Joan Baez's.  Yeah, it's fucking great.  That's the older Joan Baez.  That's a good tune, though.  I don't know why I never liked her.  Dylan must have fucked her well. 
[01:10:00]  For her to write a song about him, he must have really fucked her brains out.  Imagine what he had to deal with.  Imagine the bush he had to deal with.  That thing was probably crazy.  The tubes were awful.  She had that, ah, ah, in her voice.  Yeah, I don't like that either.  Is it called vibrato or something?  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, some vibrato, some tremolo.  Yeah, Elvis.  In the ghetto.  Sounded good.  Yeah.  What is this?  This is Diamonds and Rust.  This is Nights in White Satin.  Yeah, I have some really fruity tastes sometimes. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I think we all do, but.  You just never write to Joan Baez.  Just driving.  The soundtrack of your life.  Jimmy's all dramatic in his car.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  I kind of like this.  Mood lighting's coming through the windshield.  Yeah, wearing glasses.  Oh.  See a skirt with a bulge in it and a reflection.  All the streets are wet and reflecting the stoplights and everything.  Yeah.  Good shot.  But I'm doing non-dramatic things.  Like, I think it's dramatic, but it's really not.  Like, when you had to call, you see me putting the phone next to my head, but it's an iPhone, 
[01:11:00]  so it obviously can't be that old.  I get everything wrong.  And a very good point coming in on the Twitter.  Did you say Jim's a faggot?  That's a great point.  Beastie 333.  Yes.  Beastie with the IE at the end, so maybe get some followers out of this.  Sure.  It says, weird that Ant hates Leonard Cohen, but he loves sleeves.  How can you love sleeves and not like Leonard Cohen?  I was distracted for two seconds.  I was going to say that.  I was going to say, Leonard Cohen is like fucking sleeves to me. 
[01:11:30]  Did you see Sleeves' latest video about the leaves?  Why would I?  Did you see it?  Why would I?  Why?  I really want to now.  Sleeves about the leaves?  He's a true artist.  You just don't get it, man.  He's so avant-garde.  Get the Sleeves video with the leaves.  I don't know.  Someone tweeted.  I like Mighty Horse.  I clicked on it.  It's the only one I like.  The Mighty Horse.  No, I don't even know if this is.  And the Christmas song.  No.  I hate the fucking Christmas.  I don't even know if it's a song. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, man.  It's almost done.  We're getting towards it.  Not yet, yet.  Iraq, turn it off.  Fuck it, Ace.  We're not ready for that yet.  Soon.  Yeah.  Soon.  Where's his Leaves video?  You gotta see the Leaves video.  Go to his website.  Oh, my God.  Which is, um...  What is it?  Radio Ghost?  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  Wait till you see the Leaves video.  I can't.  I liked how it was filmed. 
[01:12:30]  But I know it'll drive you nuts.  Is it about Leaves?  Well, you know, it's fall.  Is it about everybody going somewhere?  Well, the Leaves are going away.  Are they?  They're going downstream.  Yeah, like they do every year.  Going downstream.  And that's...  We can't find it?  Fuck.  Where's Sleeves singing Leaves?  Oh, wait.  Look at that one.  I hear this.  Wait.  Can you go up for a second?  I want to read what it says.  A walk...  Wait, go one more up.  The Shepherd of Leaves?  Right here.  A walk to the faraway river.  That's a different one.  I know, but I'm telling you, this guy's on to something. 
[01:13:00]  And regular walk of Sherwin's is documented here, past the helicopter barn, wooden bear, towards the real deer and real bear, to the faraway river, where Sherwin herds leaves downstream.  Sherwin's a douche.  I want to...  You don't want to herd leaves?  I want to live the life of Sherwin.  It looks very peaceful and simple.  You don't even need dogs to herd leaves. 
[01:13:30]  They just lay there like faggots.  These are the worst.  Here's the Shepherd of Leaves video.  Yeah.  He's the Shepherd of Leaves.  He's the Shepherd of Leaves.  They just crinkle.  Fucking assholes.  I don't need your help.  Sherwin.  Six minutes.  Six fucking minutes.  Look, there he's walking upstream.  He's got a cane, huh?  Yeah.  It's very artistic.  I think I know how this goes.  Radio Ghost presents the Shepherd of Leaves.  From a bench in the town.  To a bench in the trees.  Under fallen old snow, over fallen old leaves. 
[01:14:00]  Like a leaky old boat on an empty old sea.  An empty sea?  How is your boat leaking?  The sea's empty, you dummy.  Maybe all the water's in the boat.  Oh, okay.  There's a whole ocean of water in it, too.  That's a big boat.  A leaky old boat in an empty old sea.  He's just fucking saying things.  I want to hear the words.  He's just saying, you want to hear the words? 
[01:14:30]  Put your back up.  He yelled over the words.  Maybe the empty sea, he doesn't mean water-wise.  Maybe empty, meaning it's just vast and there's nothing there.  I take like a literal, you know, translation there.  Oh, empty sea.  Like he's alone in a leaky boat on an empty sea.  Or maybe he's talking about women on the radio.  A bunch of empty seas.  This video, I don't mind this song, but the video, he's like, don't just set up a camera  and then pace back and forth.  That's what he's doing.  This is fucking depressing.  This is making me have to shit. 
[01:15:00]  Blow my head off.  Jesus.  It's the setup shot.  Relax.  It gets better.  I hope so.  Did Sherwin raking?  Sherwin Sleeds needs a bigger audience for his music, I'm telling you.  Yeah, well.  This guy knows how to fucking sing.  I bet I know they're in a picture.  I bet the next video there's a fucking Mexican with one of those air blowers.  He's blowing all the leaves.  Sha-la-la-la-la.  Got one in my eye.  Fa-la-la-la-la.  Now I'm blind with leaf juice.  Fa-la-la-la-la.  The fucking Mexicans put them in my pool.  They don't understand you don't blow it toward the fucking pool. 
[01:15:30]  I ran over a kid who was hiding in them.  La-la-la.  It's hard to rape someone when you're crinkling up on leaves.  La-la.  Because they can hear you feed a crunch.  La-la-la.  Can you guys give us a chance?  All right.  He's the shepherd of leaves, Ed.  Yeah, I want to hear what the shepherd of leaves is doing.  He's not.  It's so easy to be the shepherd of leaves.  I'm the shepherd of trees.  Ah!  Yeah.  They don't move.  That's great.  How about you shepherd fucking an animal that's running away?  That's a challenge. 
[01:16:00]  Who wants to shepherd leaves?  They lay there.  They lay there.  Can I set this up?  Let's catch up, Patience.  He's the shepherd of leaves because leaves don't want to just lay there.  He's the one that helps them along on their journey and places them in the little stream.  All right.  You're fucking crazy.  They don't want to go?  What?  The leaves don't care.  They're killing themselves.  They're jumping off the trees.  They hate it.  Look, man.  The paragraph before this says that this video is meant for instruction purposes only.  Right.  Instruction?  Yes.  You've got to help.  Instruction for what?  The practice of shepherding leaves. 
[01:16:30]  The leaves don't want to just sit there, man.  This guy's a lunatic.  Meanwhile, he's walking through them.  That's what they want.  Yeah, he's stepping on them.  Your dirty dog shit shoes all over them.  They're minding their business in the woods, enjoying the breeze, and he's trampling them with  his fucking tripod.  Trotting upon them.  Yeah.  Depressing them with that fucking voice and horrible piano.  That awful still fucking water that's not moving.  What?  He kicked the leaves into the murk?  Yeah, that's all stagnant fucking death water.  It's the set up.  Look at it.  That's a place where leaves don't want to be.  He's going to get the leaves where they want to be. 
[01:17:00]  Maybe him and Tom Bosley can put them in a glad bag.  Fucking leaves are creeps.  I fucking hate leaves.  How much time we got in the Shepard of Leaves song?  Approximately five.  Just about five and a half, five and forty.  We've only been through 30 seconds.  Let's try to get through another 30 seconds.  Please.  Please.  Please.  I beg you.  All right.  It's fall.  This is perfect.  All right.  Hit it.  You leak till you're empty.  When empty, you're free. 
[01:17:30]  What?  Okay, here's the water.  I'd like to climb like a golden flower.  Sunlight red.  I'm telling my power in a ballroom dream.  Ballroom dream?  Pause.  Pause.  This fucking guy is a fraud.  He's a fucking fraud.  Why?  Because he's just putting words together that mean nothing. 
[01:18:00]  You think he's trying to be poetic?  Yes.  You were quiet there for a while.  They mean, but the walk.  He got three lines in there.  Only a minute in.  That made no sense.  By Sherman's Leaves.  A ballroom dream.  A fucking gold flower.  Yes.  A ballroom dream.  Maybe he's dreaming that he fucking, that Mr. Jeeves spilled some fucking avocado all over  his jacket.  Maybe he's dreaming about the goose and duck soiree.  Soiree.  Yes.  Kill my wife with an axe for la la la la.  He's a fraud. 
[01:18:30]  Blow me in a bunny suit for la la la la.  He's setting up the whole video in the song.  Have some patience.  Look, now we got a nice shot of a stream that's moving quite quickly.  She looked good in the tub.  She looked shitty in the tub.  She looked good in the tub.  Her back was all rotten.  Fa la la la la la.  Her back smelled like my asshole.  Fa la la la.  And Sean in Illinois is calling you a dope, and he should.  He says, empty sea as in no other boats, you dope.  Ah, right.  He's the only boat on the sea. 
[01:19:00]  I get it.  Too bad he wasn't by Somalia.  Yeah.  And his leaky boat.  Exactly.  Which it just went under.  You're here gurgling, and that's the end of the song.  All right.  Let's come on.  All right.  Let's try to get through the shepherd of leaves.  How do you not mind it?  Try to be quiet, Anne.  All right?  All right.  I'll try.  All right.  I dance with the old river queen.  River queen.  You should sing me a song in my dreams.  I got to piss.  Hiller is everything that I see. 
[01:19:30]  You don't put water in your song.  Pause that.  He should make the water louder.  Jesus Christ.  I know.  Who's running the sound effects?  E-Rock?  It's a little loud in the mix, wouldn't you say?  A little loud.  Co-sung with water.  Who doesn't enjoy some water in their songs?  I hate water in my songs, always.  Is that water in the song?  Not a fan of water in your songs?  Never.  It will ruin any song.  You put a splash in a fucking Sabbath song, and I wouldn't listen to it.  What's some of those water songs out there?  Love, Rain, War, Me.  Oh, yeah.  They got some water?  I don't like Rain, War, Me.  Yeah.  I can't just say over, please. 
[01:20:00]  I know.  O-R-R-R.  Rain, War, Me.  Is it O apostrophe E-R or something?  Yeah, something like that.  Just say over.  It's over.  Because that's how we sing it anyway.  I know.  We don't go, what is it?  Fucking limey.  Love, Rain, War, Me.  Any other water songs?  You got the main one, I think.  Someone's saying Champagne Supernova?  Yeah, they got a little...  Yeah.  Yep.  In the sky. 
[01:20:30]  Is that it for water songs?  The Beatles' Yellow Submarine has that sloshy...  Oh, right.  Splashy.  And then The Beatles' Rain.  What song was that you were talking about?  The first one?  The Yellow Submarine.  Why?  You didn't say it right.  You didn't say it right.  Yellow Submarine.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich. 
[01:21:00]  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  I love it.  Fucking terrible.  Now there's water in the song.  You don't like this?  No.  You got to interpret this song, man.  Interpret.  I don't want to interpret a song.  How much time are we left in the song?  There's still another five minutes.  Holy shit.  Man, if you be quiet, we can get through this.  All right.  Let's try.  All right.  The water's a little loud, you're saying.  I won't nitpick.  Here's what I do. 
[01:21:30]  I won't nitpick.  I'll just comment on the shit that really gets to me.  All right.  Let's go.  What the fuck is this, Blair Witch?  He's going to leave to get in line.  Then you will proceed right down here.  There you go.  All right, Philip.  Good work.  Johnny, nice to see you.  All right, stop.  All right.  I can't.  What's the problem? 
[01:22:00]  He's talking to the leaves.  This is a joke.  He's talking to the leaves.  He's the shepherd of leaves.  They're going down a stream, and he's looking at them and saying, there you go.  There you go.  There you go, Johnny.  Oh, I wish he'd just fall face first into that puddle and drown in two inches of water.  You didn't like the camera thing he did there, where all of a sudden he lifted up the camera and got all shaky for a moment?  That was nice.  What the fuck kind of mic did he have on that thing?  Oh, you know.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Leaves.  Leaves. 
[01:22:30]  Just every year.  Josh.  Josh.  Josh.  I should have come out here.  He's showing that the leaves have a personality.  No, they don't.  They do, though.  You think he'll talk to Ted the leaf?  I fell off the trees, leaves.  Could you please help a fellow?  Shepherd me.  I've lost my chlorophyll.  I was turning colors.  Now I'm all crinkly.  I like to be moist and colorful. 
[01:23:00]  I'm dry and people are stepping on me.  I don't want to be in your scrapbook of leaves.  Shepherd me.  Shepherd.  And shepherd you down the river.  In the fall, it's very easy to break their little brittle bones.  I know.  I look like an osteoporosis person, helping my back's brittle like an old lady.  Guns N' Roses, November Rain.  Ah, yeah.  There you go.  More water songs coming in.  More water.  And Jimmy, I don't know, but someone's saying Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath starts with  Rain.  Oh, yes, it does. 
[01:23:30]  That's the opening.  Thank you, Mikey.  How did I forget that?  Thank you, Mikey.  I take back what I said.  All right.  Are we getting through the song?  We're doing good now.  Right, Sam?  Now he's done with the song part and he's fucking...  Well...  Oh, God.  This is terrible.  Helping the leaves.  Let's go.  Shepherd of Leaves by Sherwin Sleeves.  Bob.  He's done it last year.  I've done it.  I've saved it.  Emily.  Beautiful.  Rain.  He's...  Chip.  What are you doing or something? 
[01:24:00]  What are you doing there, Sleeves?  How come you put an S in front of my name?  Yo, I'm Leaves, your Sleeves.  Maybe I should be Leaves.  Yes, sir.  There goes Chip.  In the river.  What does this mean?  Where does this guy come from?  Fucking...  What is he?  He's very artistic.  Artistic?  Yes, he is, sir.  It's like he came from the fucking, like, 1500s.  Well, that's what's the...  Is that what he's trying to do?  That's the beauty of it.  Is he a renaissance man?  He likes to live more of a simple life.  I still think his sledding video with his son is terrific. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, let's not forget Riders on the Storm, people.  Oh.  I hate the doors.  I hate the doors.  You don't like People are Strange?  No.  You know why?  The doors are so fucking played out.  Just, like, any song that's on.  It's...  What about waiting?  Waiting?  No.  I kind of like this is the end.  The end is good because of Apocalypse.  Apocalypse.  It's, like, cool.  Yeah.  By the way, Wonderful Tonight, is that...  That's a Clapton song?  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Extremely overrated.  Really?  Wow.  Wonderful.  You know how many fucking lame weddings probably had that as the fucking wedding song?  True.  No.  Two fucking idiots and mullets dancing.  Wonderful.  Oh, I get it.  Because your mediocre bride looks wonderful tonight, you deluded asshole.  You should be playing, you look average tonight.  You're mediocre.  You look fuckable tonight.  Ugh.  Wonderful.  Wonderful. 
[01:25:30]  Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  Ugh.  You don't like that little riff?  No, I don't.  Meow.  Oh, his guitar is wailing with emotion.  What do you mean?  Fucking boo.  What do you mean the mediocre bride, though?  Because you know during the wedding ceremony when they're dancing, Mr. and Mrs. Schlepp-Schlepperson.  Yes.  Let's bring out the brand new Mr. and Mrs. Schlepp-Schlepperson.  Yeah.  And then they're dancing.  And they smile.  And then they whisper something to each other and start laughing. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh, then the punching starts.  Then he whispers, you look beautiful.  And she smiles with her dumb face.  And he realizes she has a spittle in the corner of her mouth.  And she's insane.  And her breath stinks.  She has fucking sour dry mouth.  He's like, what's your mouth?  Nothing worse than a tight wedding dress on a fat girl.  Oh, no.  Terrible.  It's really.  In fact.  You are wonderful tonight.  Oh, here's it. 
[01:26:30]  Chocolate Rain.  Water songs.  Let's go.  Chocolate Rain.  I'm still playing.  Who'll Stop the Rain is a great one.  Oh, oh.  My credence.  But is there water in it?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm just naming songs with water.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we're all doing.  Smoke on the water.  Yeah, but is there water in it?  Yes.  I don't think Smoke on the Water actually has water in the song.  Yes.  Like, stomp, stomp, stomp.  Trickle, trickle, trickle.  Oh, there is some trickles.  It's got to put off a fire in the sky.  Are we giving up on the Shepard?  No, I got to hear Shepard some leaves more.  I want to see where this goes next.  All right, let's go.  Barbara. 
[01:27:00]  Douglas.  Douglas Leaf.  Watch out, Douglas.  Charles.  Always going under the water.  His wife, Mary.  Oh, Mary.  Charles.  Mary, you're stuck here.  He's naming every leaf as it goes by in the water.  Like a mental patient.  Sorry.  Oh, strangers. 
[01:27:30]  How long?  All in line.  Thank you.  Right through here.  How many are in the air?  And down.  That's the way to do it.  He's walking in the water.  The other way.  Dead end.  It's not good up that way.  We just stop.  If anyone wants to stop, needs a break.  We go up this way.  He's telling the leaves where to go.  Chris Crumcoding.  Chris Crumcoding, yeah.  Right.  My problem with this, I do have a critique.  His camera work sucks.  You can't see the fucking leaves going by. 
[01:28:00]  Of course it does.  Who wants to watch a bunch of leaves?  It was interesting for one leaf.  Well, if the whole concept is the shepherd of leaves and you see him going faster in the stream and then his camera work sucks.  Cool.  Check out mine.  The shepherd of ants.  The shepherd of bees.  I'm the shepherd of SUVs.  I stand on the bridge and I film them.  I name them.  You're the shepherd of farts.  There goes Bob.  Bill.  Bill.  You've got to get those farts out, Jimmy.  It doesn't go anywhere.  Yes, it's going somewhere.  Where does this go?  I hope he jumps up and down on them and kills them. 
[01:28:30]  Abort the leaves.  They're dead.  The little hanger.  Open their leaf vaginas and kill the leaf babies.  We're almost done with the shepherd of leaves.  Well, not all.  The white leaves running from the dark leaves.  A ball.  And so you'll probably just end up there for the rest of your life.  If you want to keep moving, this way here.  Down here.  There you go.  I don't know any of these.  I don't know where they are. 
[01:29:00]  Again, he's just watching leaves.  He's a joke.  He's joking.  Is he?  Mortar right up there.  Mortar.  Yeah.  Mortar.  Why is it a joke?  A joke has to kind of be funny.  This is not a joke.  Mortar.  Mortar, man.  He's deep, man.  Mortar, man.  Mortar, man.  Can you hear me?  Imagine my piss stream coming up from the other side.  There's Mortar.  Drink this.  He's done this before.  All right.  We'll see you. 
[01:29:30]  Ah, the leaf got stuck.  Keep going, Mortar.  He always picks the trickiest ticket.  But he makes the idea.  How does he know?  I've never seen that leaf in an hour.  Because he's a shepherd of leaves.  He knows this shit, eh?  No.  Yes, he does.  He's a blithering idiot, and I think he's insane.  He should shepherd a shotgun bullet through his head.  Something of a cop in there.  A cop?  Not a real cop.  What?  The wood is boned out.  It's an excellent place for bear soup. 
[01:30:00]  Look at that.  What is he saying?  He's walking upstream a little bit.  You might think the beaver had done this, but it's the natural beavering of the world.  Through all these sticks here where the river was running so high.  Natural beavering.  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  What did he just...  He just had some time on his hands and a camera. 
[01:30:30]  That giant appendage field.  I'm kind of scared of two thumbs, and then the fingers of the hand gone, but the palm  open to catch perhaps a meteor.  To catch a meteor.  Perhaps.  It's a goof.  No.  Someone will later.  He's insane.  No, it's a goof.  I'm saying he's insane.  I think it's a goof.  It's not a goof.  Has to be.  He's a funny guy, though.  It's all about the simple, simple stuff.  This is a very simple existence.  Who cares about these dumb fucking trees?  We don't need to be narrated. 
[01:31:00]  He sounds like the guy at Attenborough.  So, it's not a goof, because then where's the big ta-da?  They don't need a big ta-da.  No, you don't.  Yeah, you do.  Mm-mm.  But a lot of these things are just kind of...  Sherman Sleeves is not a goof.  He's very artistic and very deep.  He's just fucking a knot hole in a tree.  Yeah.  Now, that'd be funny.  Yeah.  Maybe get Woody Woodpecker in here or something to stop poking holes in the whole damn town  or something.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's keep it going.  Thank you, Bear Soup.  Bear Soup.  We're almost done. 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  I'm making some in my pants looking at this gentleman.  You see all your leaves down at the leaf pile?  All right.  Just keep going, you'll make it.  Try to stay away from the science.  Science is very dangerous.  You know that, Bear.  You don't need reminder, do you?  Do you?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  The leaves spend such a good time, a good deal of their time, sleeping. 
[01:32:00]  It's like you're walking on, like, broken glass?  I don't know how many people know this, but the leaves also.  You see a little child's shoe in the foreground?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Leaves are good for covering over shallow graves of young children.  You missed the part.  They whistle.  They whistle.  The leaves whistle.  The leaves whistle.  No, they don't.  Yeah, they do.  You don't have to go back, Sam.  We've got to get through this.  God damn no.  We've just got to get to the end of this thing at this point.  We're going to get here a train whistle.  These are tracks, yes. 
[01:32:30]  I do have a question, though.  Are you wishing that some big corporation comes in and takes away his little stream?  Oh, fuck.  That'd be great.  Or some just horrific.  Nice giant caterpillar fucking bulldozers just plowing over his dumb trees and his leaves  and his dumb river.  I hope that stream is behind an Exxon fucking facility.  Yeah.  It's a poison.  Love canal.  You want to see a sewage pipe so badly, don't you?  Oh, yes.  What have they done to my beautiful leaves?  They've taken them and plowed them asunder to build some type of monolithic corporate headquarters 
[01:33:00]  of...  Shut up!  Shut up!  The Shepherd of Leaves, the finale, please.  You whistle.  You know how to get there.  No.  I'm just not good at it.  And that's it.  No one enjoys this.  Now he's limping away with his cane.  He did his job. 
[01:33:30]  No, he didn't.  Yeah, he did.  Fucking talk to a few shitty leaves.  Yeah.  There he goes.  Dressed like he's from when it...  From the...  Hans Christian and Anderson.  Yeah, he's definitely from the Renaissance period or something.  That was Leaves.  He was talking to a badger cum on them.  They're getting fucked on by a couple of wild animals.  Fucking terrible.  I'll tell you this much.  It's not a goof.  No, I think he's quite insane.  Where does he live?  In the woods.  Does he?  Somewhere. 
[01:34:00]  Lived it in his own heart.  I saw that again, too.  Feeling pretty good.  No, well...  No, I'm just thinking what that means, living in his own heart.  Sling blade.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  That boy lived in his own heart.  What?  I don't know what that means, either.  He was just eating french fried potatoes.  This guy had potty meat.  This guy has his fans, man.  You better be careful.  No one enjoys that leaf video.  No one.  No one.  It's terrible.  No one enjoyed watching him name leaves.  Let's look at nature.  As they went by.  He's deep in the woods. 
[01:34:30]  What other stuff does he have on his website?  We don't have to do them now.  I bet he goes out there and jerks off in the woods.  Of course he does.  You see a little leaf with cum on it?  He's got four likes on his video, man.  Chip, four likes.  This is like Jocktober.  The comments include, move on with the fucking show already.  The next is Chip saying this guy should make a tree and leave.  Another Chip saying, does this guy wear long-sleeved shirts or something?  The Chip lines. 
[01:35:00]  At least he's getting comments.  He's got 136 views.  Massive.  Mike in Pittsburgh writes, that dick wouldn't be talking about leaves if he had to rake them.  That's true.  When you have to rake that shit, you don't look at it in a romantical way.  Oh, no.  Those sleeves.  Those long-sleeved shirts.  Yeah, I've had it with the...  That was terrible.  Oh, boy.  Bobby Bigrigger has a spoiler.  Are you all right with a spoiler today? 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  Bobby Bigrigger, go ahead.  Hey, what do you say, guys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, brother.  I hate to tell you guys, but the leaves, they were already dead.  They were dead the whole time?  Oh, dead the whole video.  Fuck.  Fuck.  What does sleeves do?  He's a radio ghost.  He's the radio ghost.  Oh, what does the radio ghost mean?  He's doing what you're doing.  He's doing some news streaming.  Well, I don't think it's what I'm doing.  You're not making videos of the leaves.  What's he get on there and fucking...  What does he talk about? 
[01:36:00]  Give me...  God, I bet...  Oh, my God.  I can only imagine what his podcast is like.  Oh, boy.  He has a...  I need a job section.  I need a job.  That's never good.  I need a job.  For the past two years, I've been doing radio work for National Public Radio and New Hampshire Public Radio.  My radio pieces have aired on Day Today, Weekend America, Voice of America, and on various stations throughout the country.  I've won awards for both my fictional Sherwin Sleeves radio pieces as well as my non-fictional work.  And last year, an hour-long documentary profile of me and my alter ego aired on Chicago Public Radio. 
[01:36:30]  Chicago Public Radio.  Chicago Public Radio is pretty big.  That's huge.  That's a big step from New Hampshire Public Radio.  For the last 10 years through 2008, I was fully employed, working from home as a copywriter for Sheppin's Retina Associates in Boston.  What the fuck is that?  They closed down in 2008, you see.  How about his podcast was named Best Podcast in New Hampshire?  Oh, so he's like in the woods of New Hampshire, I'm assuming. 
[01:37:00]  He's also been a stay-at-home father since 2005.  My son Sam is now four and a half.  His real name is Sean Hurley.  Great name.  Is it Sean Hurley?  Hi.  Hi.  There you go.  That's it with Sherwin Sleeves.  That's his alter ego.  Did a whole documentary on it.  It's got to be fascinating.  It is, man.  Jesus Christ.  I thought I would bring that to your attention today. 
[01:37:30]  Thanks.  I was enjoying the song, too.  I wish he would have just sang the song about leaves.  Then he had to, you know, usher it down.  Well, he realized he couldn't do much with leaves, so.  Sure he can.  It had to be a quick song.  Fucking go through it and tell them they're hanging in the trees and then they fucking turn colors and shit.  Oh, that's a good point.  Tim Holtz from PA writes,  Sleeves dumped a little girl's body downstream and he's sending the leaves down to hide the body.  Let's cover her up.  La, la, la, la.  Let's cover her up.  Yeah, they break so easy. 
[01:38:00]  We should break.  Like little necks.  I was petting her in the barn like Lenny.  And she had Curly's wife.  Broken neck.  Oh, well.  Just wanted to tend the rabbits.  Sure win.  All right.  All right.  We're going to break.  We're going to do some Kadavi.  Or Kadavi.  Yeah.  It's looking great over there.  Rah, rah, democracy.  What?  Yeah.  Until fucking an Ayatollah's in charge. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  And then we'll talk about Occupy Wall Street.  Where are we at five weeks later?  Oh, it's amazing what's going on over there.  The funniest shit.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's all coming.  We might talk paranormal because Sam.  All those chickens are coming home to roost.  Sam went and had an experience.  So we'll talk about that.  Oh, yeah?  I was.  By Curious.  What do you think?  Yes, Jimmy.  I was in a comedy club and Al Pacino is there watching the show and then the next thing 
[01:39:00]  you know, I'm walking with Rudy Giuliani talking about New York and I realized I forgot to  get a picture with Al Pacino.  Oh, no.  Is this really a dream you had?  Oh, yeah.  It's the same fucking dream.  Stop with the picture.  That's my dream.  It's ruining your life.  I was in Pittsburgh.  I had that dream.  The pictures are ruining your life at this point.  I fucking forgot to get the picture with Pacino, but he liked me.  We were talking comedy.  Yeah.  So I went back.  What would happen?  Yeah.  What would happen if all your pictures were piled up on a table and were like lit in flames? 
[01:39:30]  I would just put, I would just go to my heart.  No, everything's gone.  I would just go online.  All your pictures went down a river.  Look, there goes Jimmy.  And J.J. Walker.  Jimmy Walker.  I don't know.  I'd be very bummed because they're fun.  I like having them.  Yeah.  I don't know what they mean.  Probably not.  No, that's very.  The older you get, you realize that stuff just sucks.  It doesn't mean shit.  Like everything?  Just stuff.  Like the stuff you collect. 
[01:40:00]  You know what I mean?  What?  Like you start thinking of your own mortality and think of what's this going to be?  Like about Schmidt?  Well, when you were a kid.  Is that in a dumpster?  A dumb baseball card collection or something meant the world to you.  Like Jimmy's pictures mean the world to him.  But then.  I don't know.  Is it that important the older you get?  I think you just get new things.  Yeah.  New fun things to collect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  La la la.  Radio Ghost.  La la la.  Chasing some leaves.  La la la. 
[01:40:30]  Making up words.  Hey, let it be known.  You guys wanted the whole thing.  I just wanted to take a little peek at the show.  I wanted to see where it was going.  And it's like so many movies.  You watch it till the end.  And they go, fuck, what a waste of time.  Credits start rolling.  You're like, what did I just watch?  What the fudge?  You just don't get it, man.  We should get someone that understands Sherwin's sleeves to explain them someday.  Someday.  We don't have to do it.  Funded institution.  That's fucking someone rocking in their own feces right now.  Hey, something came to our attention last week. 
[01:41:00]  And Danny reminded me that we did play this.  But for some reason, it made the rounds again last week on Twitter.  Oh.  Does spelling be N-word thing?  Oh, yeah.  And even though we have done this in the past, it's certainly worth playing again.  Jimmy.  So we'll do this to break here, okay?  All right.  If I could get this thing to work.  Oh, shit.  These fucking CD players are starting to look really old.  These are the same ones we had at AF.  They are.  Oh, boy.  This one's so old that I can't open the drawer anymore. 
[01:41:30]  Why do they still have these?  I don't know.  These Denons were like state-of-the-art when we first started in Boston.  Yeah.  I don't think it's reading the CD.  Well, it's not like electronics really get better after a couple of years.  Usually just the same shit.  Oh, I don't know if it's going to work in it.  I don't think it's going to work.  It's not booting up, eh?  I think it's malformed.  Oh, shit.  I think we've got it malformed.  Here, Sam. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, corrupt.  Corrupt files.  Maybe we could do another copy of that and see if it works for the next break.  All right.  You better have some.  Oh, you rock.  Better have plan B.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  In a world where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land.  Fuck you and your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  A much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is.  We're going to fight.  Livewire.  I'm not afraid of your information. 
[01:42:30]  Engineer or no engineer.  Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality and you're an asshole.  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now.  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with Livewire.  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago.  That's exactly my point, you stupid fuck.  Little dick motherfucker.  Couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this. 
[01:43:00]  Strap in, folks.  This is where it gets really exciting.  Because I'm the truth-sayer.  Livewire.  Coming soon to a theater near you.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that.  99, maybe.  And he goes, um...  Dude, what are you doing tonight? 
[01:43:30]  I said, I'm playing down the village.  Let's fucking hang out.  I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it.  And some kid from NYU left his knapsack.  With all his books and notebooks.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is it?  A guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass.  From the minute I get it.  From the minute I get it, he's like,  Dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  Give me the fuck. 
[01:44:00]  It's ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with this fucking knapsack.  So, I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  I said, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street.  Hits some chick in the leg.  And it opens up.  And the bags go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh? 
[01:44:30]  Are we hanging?  Fuck the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting in my face.  Are we hanging on a wall?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  To the guy who said he had a chick with double D tits and dick sucking lips, she's a fatty! 
[01:45:00]  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you out to my fucking balls.  I decided to get the flu.  Fucking, my balls are like saltwater caffeine.  And they're sticking to everything.  And they're fucking annoying.  Hey, fuck you, balls.  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to my ex-girlfriend.  You leave me for a short guy that is married?

That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:47:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I think we're going to move into Jocktober, huh?  Well, people seem to be digging Jocktober this year more than usual for some reason.  It's sort of gotten interactive a little bit.  And, you know, there's never a shortage of shitty shows to feature.  And, you know, we're looking at, what's today's date? 
[01:47:30]  I mean, it's the 24th?  Wow, we're almost done with Jocktober?  Yeah, Jocktober.  That is the quickest month.  It just really whizzes by with Jocktober.  I think Sam's been lazy then.  Yeah.  We've only featured like three or four shows.  What are you talking about?  We've had a show every day.  Oh, boy.  Three or four shows.  We missed one.  More than three or four.  He came in.  That was a little joke.  Mother doesn't joke.  Mother never jokes about it.  But you see how he stares at you?  He really does get all flustered.  What the fuck, dude?  I'm not flustered.  Let's go.  Of course you'd feature more shit. 
[01:48:00]  Holy shit.  He gets very defensive.  Can we put a wall up over there?  I'm ready.  Is Mother okay with us and how we handled her last time?  No.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No.  She's okay, but she's, you know, I mean.  I notice I still don't have my fucking key lime pie in front of me or our peanut butter cookies  that fall apart.  Yeah.  She didn't take it like in stride like she usually does.  She was.  She's not sort of as motivated to do it as she used to be. 
[01:48:30]  I bet she cursed up a storm.  She probably said, fuck those cocksuckers.  I'm not cooking them shit.  Yeah.  Let's bake their own cookies.  So she's willing to accept that Paul's mom is the key lime pie champion.  I don't think she's willing to accept that.  She's willing to accept that.  Yeah, she is.  She doesn't care.  She, meaning Paul's mom, is the current champion.  You know that.  Sam, you know that in your heart.  No, I don't.  I don't.  I mean, there's nothing.  What?  Because she put schlop on some store-bought crust?  Doesn't matter, man.  It was good.  She's the champion.  It wasn't good.  Schlop. 
[01:49:00]  Schlop.  It was delicious, actually.  Your mom was a no-show.  That means Paul's mom is the official key lime pie champion.  My mom waits until key limes are in season.  Well, that's the mistake she made now, right?  Whatever shit she can throw together.  Oh, damn.  It sounds like an excuse to me.  Yep.  Yep.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  It's an excuse.  Who is the key lime pie current champion?  Well, the only person.  I didn't ask you, Sam.  You're right.  I would say the only person with an entry.  Yeah.  It's a baking championship, by the way. 
[01:49:30]  Key lime pie is an event, not a championship.  Stuttering idiot.  Yes, it is.  There's no championship.  Paul's mom is going to have something new.  When?  Soon.  That's right.  That bitch can cook.  He's coming in.  That bitch can cook.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that bitch makes some pie.  We will get into Jacktober in a few minutes here.  Maybe she'll bring in cupcakes next, frosting in the middle, and they'll be hostess.  Then she'll be the cupcake champion as well.  Rash individually.  Yankee doodle.  Right.  Exactly.  Yankee doodle.  She makes sponge cake. 
[01:50:00]  Twinkies.  Paul's mom is the Michael Phelps of baking, Sam.  That's right.  I said it.  I said it.  It's because she's awkward looking.  Yeah.  She smokes pot.  Whoa.  That's right.  She fucks Jim Jeffery's current girlfriend.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  Let me see who's banging Michael Phelps' side.  Go ahead, Paul.  Oh, no.  I was just telling Eric.  My mom's down in Key West right now, bringing her.  Key Lime's back up.  Fresh from her own tree in her backyard.  So, one trick pony is going to be back in action with some store-bought pie crust. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, shit talking.  Did your mom even show up the other day?  Whoa.  That is true.  She wasn't even showing up in the competition, Sam.  Whatever.  She didn't bring any.  She didn't bring anything.  She was on the air the other day.  Are we going to?  And she was asked about her pubic hairstyle and the size of her son's penis.  So, no.  She didn't get around to baking for a bunch of people who would do well.  She turned on.  Sam, we are all horned up.  We do appreciate your mom's baking, but unfortunately, she's not the current champion. 
[01:51:00]  Paul's mom is.  And is your mom going back to the Key Lime pie or something different, Paul?  I'm sorry.  Well, fresh Key Lime is a new fresh batch of Key Lime pies.  Same shit, different day is the answer.  She offered cookies a couple of weeks ago, but I told her to not keep you.  Peanut butter cookies that fall apart.  Please.  Yeah.  That's what I'm looking for.  I don't mind a gooey peanut butter cookie.  It's got to be gooey.  Okay.  She probably is.  I thought she could take that film, too.  Well, no.  She's in Florida, so she's not good.  Does she like her baking?  We're in Florida.  Yeah.  She's just, you know, she's kind of retired and bored, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you partake in a lot of the baked goods? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  I don't cook myself, so she just needs me.  No one's commented on the fact that he's bulked up a bit since we first met.  Another one that started out skinny.  Another skinny, yeah.  Guy that started as a skinny intern and then, oh, well.  Yeah, well, this place kind of beats down your soul.  It really does.  You're right.  But he looks like, what's the bit we did where, like, in shape, out of shape?  Paul's in shape, out of shape guy.  He got that.  Oh, from the 50s or whatever?  Yeah.  They got the Long Island gut. 
[01:52:00]  You know what I mean?  Where it's like, you kind of, whatever up here, and it just kind of bulges out.  And it's like, ah.  Oh, no, I'm sucking it in right now, so you don't want to do it.  Oh, the gut doesn't get, uh.  It's all about the beers.  Well, Paul's mom officially the champion, Sam.  That's all I can tell you.  My mom hasn't confirmed this, so I can't speak for her.  But I feel like she may be dropping the baking, the baking championship and going more towards  the fuck you guys championship.  I'm not sure, though.  She's probably going to do very well at that.  I can't confirm.  That was a little much, Sam.  I mean, I'm all for playing along. 
[01:52:30]  But to make fun of my pussy, and your cock.  That's not what she said.  Who she mad at that?  Um, I mean.  What comic?  Come on.  Yes, you know.  No, I think Opie.  What got her?  Opie ends up taking the brunt of things, because Jim.  Why?  Because I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  I was nice to her.  Well, no, because you start the whole thing always.  And because Jim is a disgrace, and he's never, he's, that's just who he is.  Like, he's, what are you doing, Sam? 
[01:53:00]  He's a disgrace.  And, and, I mean.  Did your mom Sam a disgrace?  Well, she used words along those lines.  You're a disgrace.  Jim's a disgrace.  And, Ant, like, if Ant called my mom and asked what her vagina hairstyle was.  Yeah.  It's not like she would be surprised at this coming from Anthony, after all.  Oh, okay.  Whereas Opie.  I kept it nice, Sam.  He tries to be the nice guy.  I kept it between the lines.  He claims he's the nice guy.  And you know her.  She knows that we don't know her.  Right.  He goes to the house.  I might have hung out with her socially.  That's why I keep it nice when I'm on the phone. 
[01:53:30]  But that's, but I think that's why we don't, is because we don't know her as a real person.  Right.  It's a character.  Right.  It's the Sam's mom character.  It's an entity.  Yeah.  Right.  She's somebody that we, like, whack off to in theory.  Am I still cool with your dad, at least?  Whereas, yeah, my dad, my dad was all for it.  Yeah.  He thought it was funny.  He laughed.  He laughed at it.  Yeah.  He read all the Twitter comments to my mom.  He reads them to your mom.  Which is great, because now people are just tweeting me comments that say, hey, Sam's dad.  Hi, Sam's mom. 
[01:54:00]  They're tweeting to my parents through me.  That's great.  Why don't your parents get a little Twitter account there?  I've instructed them not to.  Not to?  Not to.  Facebook?  Stop controlling your mom, man.  She wants to be free, Sam.  No, she doesn't want to be free.  She wants to be free.  She wants to get rid of that dumb club she's part of.  I don't know.  She wants to tell her to join the women's club.  And she wants to let her hair down a little bit.  Tell her to bring up her hair again.  Just her regular hair.  Regular.  Well, it turned ugly last time.  And obsessed with the other hair.  I'm just talking about the regular hair.  All right.  So that's fine. 
[01:54:30]  Paul's mom.  The baking champion.  And the official baker of the Opie and Anthony show.  Tell your mom that.  I'm sure that won't bother at all.  That Paul's mom is the official baker of the Opie and Anthony show.  Now, here's the difference.  Thank you, Sam.  Time for John Culber.  She can be the official candle chip maker.  Oh.  It's John Culber.  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of crap-tastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  Come on, come on, you guys.  Thank you.  So turn up this turntacular radio. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Yes!  John Culber.  John Culber.  Ahem.  Hi, Sam.  Now, here's the difference.  Where have you been all morning?  Here's the difference.  Uh-oh.  From what?  We're talking about John Culber.  We're talking about John Culber now, Sam.  Here's the difference.  What's the sleeper?  Whereas, uh, Jim and Ant just kind of do their shocking jokes.  Don't get my tell away.  You specifically say things that you think will bother her.  Yes.  Like, they didn't go in.  Because I need her back as the official baker of the opening at the show. 
[01:55:30]  Officially, though, she's not right now.  But this is why you...  That's all I'm saying.  Get the big...  Man, is that all I'm saying?  That's all I'm hearing.  All I know is Paul's mom is the official baking fucking sponsor of the show.  You didn't say...  Champion and the official baker.  You didn't say, Sam's mom, you know, you're just really great at this and we'd really like  you to come...  No, you tried to hurt her soul and guilt her into coming back, which she's smart enough  to realize, which is why you would get the biggest of the fuck you's of the fuck you  championship.  Sam's mom would be worth the baking champion. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, she would humble Paul's mom.  She would fuck Paul's mom's pie in the ass.  Well, we're not going to know that now, are we?  I guess not.  Oh, well.  Because of that attitude.  I can fully accept Paul's mom as being the official baker of the opening at the show.  Well, you're the one that's going to do without.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll still enjoy the baked goods.  Paul's mom's bringing in more key lime pie that we enjoyed the first time around.  And now there's rumors of a peanut butter cookie that's mushy that falls apart.  So enjoy second best when the champion doesn't want to compete for you guys anymore. 
[01:56:30]  I want to know what second best is.  Yeah, but your mom reminds me of Bobby Fisher, who I think was afraid to compete because she  was afraid of losing.  Like, after he won, he went crazy because I think the idea is he had so much to lose and  nothing to gain by winning again.  And I think that's what your mother sees it as.  Right now, Anthony is the only one left that's going to get any baked goods.  Yeah.  Well, I don't trust her baked goods.  She probably puts like sialis in them to keep all of our delicious cocks hard.  You know what, Sam?  That's where her mission is.  You know what, Sam?  You tell your mom we don't need her baked goods anymore. 
[01:57:00]  I will.  Unless we've got Paul's mom.  I don't know if I'll be able to because my mouth will be full of cookies that are better  than anything you'll eat on this show.  I'll never know.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I loved the apple pie.  I did, too.  I know you guys did.  It was great.  It was all right.  It was delicious.  Oh, it was really good.  It was okay.  So far, Ant's the only one who's not in the doghouse.  Yeah.  Everybody else in the doghouse.  I like that.  I think she might have used Macintosh, which is not the best for apple pie.  All right.  That's good. 
[01:57:30]  Granny Smith.  Apple pie.  Granny Smith.  Hope he's in a naughty chair.  At least I have my soul intact, Sam.  Jacktober time?  You betcha.  Jacktober.  Yeah.  Who are we featuring today?  Can't wait.  Okay.  I always like looking at the web page first.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we got two guys.  We're going to Wisconsin, huh?  That's right.  Wisconsin's rock station.  Now, there may be other rock stations in Wisconsin, but this one is Wisconsin's rock station. 
[01:58:00]  So there's no other rock station in Wisconsin?  No, there probably are some, but this one happens to be the one Wisconsin really possesses  as its own.  Oh, really?  Possessive.  According to who?  The station.  Oh, okay.  The station themselves.  All right.  I thought maybe the people of Wisconsin voted.  No, there was no vote.  Oh, all right.  So they appointed themselves Wisconsin's rock station.  Isn't that the best thing about radio?  It's always the best.  You can appoint yourself the only station that really rock.  Yeah, yeah.  The home of rock and roll.  You can just decide, we're the home of rock.  We're the home.  Right. 
[01:58:30]  There's no voting involved.  Yeah.  This is W-A-P-L.  Oh, Rick and Glenn.  It's the Apple, everybody.  I see a Steven Tyler picture on the front of the webpage, so I guess that's the type of  music they're playing.  Steven Tyler doesn't even know they exist.  Yeah.  They've played Dude Looks Like a Lady in songs like that.  Oh, yeah.  That's one of the songs they've played.  All right.  They're a rock station.  Wisconsin's rock station.  Well, how come the morning show then is featuring a couple of guys that look like old woodshop  teachers?  Oh, my God. 
[01:59:00]  Rick and Len, huh?  Oh, God.  What names.  Look at these two.  Rick and Len.  Oh, boy.  Are they lovers?  W-A-P-L.  No, they're not lovers.  Well, you think me and Ann are going to be facing each other if we ever do another promo  shot together?  Oh, man.  Like that.  That's a cool shot.  I think that was photoshopped.  I think they chopped that together.  They look cool, though.  They're chests are together.  Oh, man.  Real cool.  That's good.  How about some fucking, at least try some Rogaine?  Yeah.  I was going to say.  You're going to have the goatee like that.  What do they have more of? 
[01:59:30]  Listeners or hair followers?  Yeah, I don't think it's hair.  No?  Look, also, the guy on the left.  That's horseshoe-y.  It's okay if you lose your hair a little bit, but horseshoe-y is something you never want.  The one guy looks like the creepy teacher that Keanu Reeves was defending in Devil's  Advocate.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Against that fucking girl from Welcome to the Dollhouse.  He's rubbing under the fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  So, two fairly older gentlemen at a rock station.  Oh, what?  What happened?  What happened?  A little Rick and Len show.  A little Rick and Len post, and under that post, somebody has written, Chip Rules.  Oh, no.  All right.  It always starts off a little soft.  It's a little slow.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Let's get something in.  Yeah, let's hear a little of this.  Well, yeah, the first post is...  Actually, it's almost poetic.  It just simply says, Morning, boys.  Have fun.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy. 
[02:00:30]  And they're off.  Cock and balls was the next one.  Yeah.  Today's Jocktober.  Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin.  Rick and Len.  Wisconsin's rock station.  You think they talk about the Packers a lot?  Oh, my God.  Their whole logo looks...  It's that football-type lettering, that font.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Taking advantage of the fact their team is undefeated?  I would think.  Who's Rick Wrangler?  Is that a...  Is that like a Special Olympics photo?  No.  What? 
[02:01:00]  I think that's really just the guy.  That's Rick from the show.  Are you serious?  They spelled rump wrong.  What do you mean a Special Olympics photo?  Well, just how the lady's hands are on his shoulder in the photo and you don't see her head.  It looks like she's kind of holding him lovingly.  And like he might be in a wheelchair or something?  I don't know.  And a smile's a little goofy, too.  Goofy.  All right, listen.  Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin. 
[02:01:30]  A Rick and Len promo.  What's the big deal about a Rick and Len promo?  Well, I thought we would start with a promo and get a feel for what the show's about.  That's precisely it.  Are they two guys?  They come across as two guys.  We're running out of John and Jeff time.  Yeah, that's true.  You don't worry about time.  The big finale or something like that.  No, you got the big finale if you bring it in.  Yeah, you got to bring it in.  Oh, no one fucking texted me to say put my car keys on it.  Kenny could do that, John.  I need constant.  Kenny!  I need constant. 
[02:02:00]  Watch how this is done properly.  But it's got to be done at the right time.  Kenny.  It can't be done now.  Yes.  When you wake up Ant, you have to tell him to bring the disc in.  Okay.  You're a child.  Bring the disc in.  You know you're a child of the 80s if.  Okay.  There's a bit we did at AF that we'll fucking.  Jimmy will probably quit the show after.  Yeah.  There's this one.  Is it not a good bit?  Oh, oh, oh.  You know you're a child of the 80s if and you guys probably list funny things.  Oh, hilarious things.  And then we get the listeners involved through taped phone calls. 
[02:02:30]  How much excitement do I have in my voice?  Do you overly laugh at me to suggest it?  I would assume you are.  Yeah, I guess we do that.  I would assume I do.  You're excited.  I'm excited.  It's just so excited.  We're both excited at least?  We're both so excited.  All right, good.  How long was the bit?  Too long.  We did it all day.  All day.  It was a running theme through the entire show.  Yeah, yeah.  Perfect.  Is that their studio?  Or is that a remote?  Maybe.  I think they're on a remote.  Yeah.  I don't think their studio is quite that large.  Big dumpy arms. 
[02:03:00]  This whole WAPL thing, as I was listening, just really reminded me of Rock 105, The Dog,  where Scorch hosted.  I'm sure.  Oh, wow.  It's just a broom closet.  It used to be an engineering room that they turned into a rock station.  Allison in New York City wants something.  Allison, go.  I just thought you guys should take a look at their biographies on their website.  Oh, I love a good bio.  Ooh, let's look at the bio.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for that.  Who would you guys like to start with?  Rick or Len?  Allison, what do you notice by reading the bios? 
[02:03:30]  I'm on Rick's biography.  If you guys are curious about how old he is, his birthday is September 12th, in the year  before the earth cooled and the dinosaurs roamed the earth.  Oh, is that what he wrote?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  There it is.  That's old.  Oh, boy.  Nothing wrong with a little self-deprecation.  All right, let's see.  I don't think he could ever write a good bio.  No. 
[02:04:00]  It always comes across douchey.  If you're going to say that you're old through a funny reference, where does it say it now?  Where does it say?  September 12th.  September 12th, in the year before the earth cooled.  Now, the earth cooled and the dinosaurs...  Literally, he's saying, I'm four billion.  Yes.  And it's like, why wouldn't you just say 150?  Yeah, there's no way that would.  When you go with a...  Ten minutes after Lincoln was shot.  Yes.  Or a Betty White joke, or a Cloris Leachman.  Yeah.  The dinosaurs...  The earth cooled billions...  Like, who believes that you're in the billions? 
[02:04:30]  That's just stupid.  I would never believe it.  I would love to talk to someone in the billions.  But if it's the year before the earth cooled and dinosaurs roamed the earth, like...  Yeah.  They didn't...  The earth cooled a lot longer than there were dinosaurs.  And who was fucking his mother when the earth was all hot?  Yes.  And there were no humans before dinosaurs.  No.  It doesn't make any sense.  Were our ancestors goop?  Yeah.  Goop.  Yeah.  Like, in certain parts of the world, they still are.  Oh, goop.  Meaningless protoplasm.  Well, like, if you... 
[02:05:00]  Too bad we can't do this shit, but if you have a tracer...  Lineage.  Your group.  Like, when does it go from humans to some weird shit?  Something else?  The missing link.  And then missing link and bring it...  And then what?  Yep.  Is there...  Could you, like, trace it all the way back to some kind of fucking...  Oh, thank you.  A little puddle with a lizard that has gills and lungs.  Right.  And then you look at that and go, well, that's a Hughes.  That was me.  Yeah, yeah.  That's my family.  I don't think they can go back that far. 
[02:05:30]  No, I know we can't, but obviously...  Obviously, that's what it's all about.  Probably because there's eventually going to be a link or maybe one or two common bottlenecks  where Hughes, Kumi, and Norton, you won't be able to trace them back to protoplasm because  it hadn't split yet.  Like, it's probably everyone...  The bottleneck, everyone is from the same thing.  I mean, the key is to find out where it splits.  I got you.  And then you know where the Hughes and the fucking Roberts and...  Fuck, this is pot talk shit.  I like this.  Oh, man.  But protoplasm is probably all of us. 
[02:06:00]  Protoplasm.  All right.  Why did I get into radio?  Yeah.  Only job I could find that required no skills, talent, or heavy lifting.  Ho-ho!  And he is actually right.  He has no skill.  No skill, no talent.  Yeah, that's right.  I guess he doesn't lift things.  Anything else worth pointing out?  Other jobs?  I guess teacher's assistant, writing commercials, and mowing the lawn in a cemetery.  Look at his hobbies.  Hobbies collect hard rock cafe pins.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Floaty pins and dust. 
[02:06:30]  Collects dust.  Obsession.  I may be beyond the point of caring enough, sorry, about anything to be truly obsessed.  So, he's got no passion for anything.  Strange phobias.  Oh, this is good.  Not only success.  Being licked by an insurance salesman.  I believe it's called geico-lingual.  Linguophobia. 
[02:07:00]  Geico-linguophobia.  Get it?  And it says, don't ask.  I won't.  You don't get it.  Oh, God.  Oh, my goodness.  If he wanted to do a Geico joke, he should have said something like, for fears, I'm afraid  of a gecko putting on, like, sharp shoes and climbing into my asshole.  Wouldn't have been funny, either.  You know how fucking awful that was to walk that far to get what I deserve, which is nothing?  Lou and Philly, wait till you get to the death row meal part of the bio. 
[02:07:30]  It's huge.  This bio is endless.  This whole thing is the death row meal.  Yeah.  Why the fuck would he read that?  It's enormous.  We can't read all that.  Why would you read all that?  I know.  It's just eat.  Why would you write all that?  All right.  Let's start, Jack Talbert.  Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin.  Here's one of their promos.  Rick and Len.  It occurred in the Hatchet Creek Wildlife Area in Florida.  Okay.  One of the fish and game officers pulls the guy over.  He says, what are you doing out here? 
[02:08:00]  He says, I'm hunting.  He says, well, can I see your hunting license?  Well, it turns out he didn't actually have.  He did have a hunting license?  Hunting license.  Well, the game warden checks him, and what he did find, no license, but he did find he  had cocaine, marijuana, vodka, a pair of women's thong panties, and a jar of Vaseline.  What the hell was this guy hunting?  Well, from the sounds of it, he was trying to lay a trap for Charlie Sheen. 
[02:08:30]  The setup could have been a little longer.  I would have liked the setup to have been longer.  Sex Bagel was just fuming in there about all the bad edits.  Yeah, they really were bad fucking edits.  We all know from Friday how riled up Eric gets when he's on.  Yeah, we want to keep him in college today.  We allowed him in the big boy seat, Jimmy, and he did not disappoint.  We got word that he was very angry about the Jacktober show we were featuring on Friday,  so we allowed him in here, and boy, he did not disappoint.  He went off.  He went off, man. 
[02:09:00]  You want to go off again today, E-Rock?  No, I'm good.  He didn't really go off.  He didn't go off at all.  No, he just sat there.  He was lackluster.  He was lackluster.  He was just kind of in here, kind of chiming in every now and then, but he had no emotions.  Lackluster is a great word.  Lackluster.  Well, it was a bit of a letdown.  It was.  The setup was, E-Rock was going to really give it to him. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  He was teasing it all day, saying, we're going to bring you in here.  Yeah.  He's going to kick ass and take names.  Yo.  He's like, I'm so pissed.  I hate this show.  You wait.  You wait until I go off.  It's my turn to shine.  And then he just came in and pointed out that the host eats donuts.  Yeah.  And that was kind of it.  It's like, whoa, watch out.  Was it a bust?  Well, I mean, the segment wasn't a bust.  It was a bust.  That was his performance.  It was so bad, it was a bust-a-roo.  Oh, wow.  That's bad.  Remember, there's a hyphen in there.  Rick and Len, APL, Wisconsin. 
[02:10:00]  Rick brings up a story about a greyhound tracking Wisconsin.  Track in.  There should be a space right.  Oh, okay.  Rick brings up a story about a greyhound track in Wisconsin, which just lights the chemistry  between the two.  You could tell by the dead air.  Hence all the bad edits, I guess, right, E-Rock?  You heard the bad edits in the promo.  Yes, very, very bad.  Anyone else hear that?  Yeah, I did.  Do you have to have a trained ear?  No, I heard that, too.  Or the listeners could pick up on that?  It's like, and it's not even so much words.  It's almost like a breath that's cut off that you could hear these little, you just know 
[02:10:30]  that something's being chopped out of it.  Yes.  They were squishing it together.  Yes.  Like that.  Like, that's how it sounded.  We're talking.  Yeah.  I know.  Okay.  My turn.  Picture of a...  Make it shorter.  ...of a guy fucking an inflatable sheep on their face.  Why would Rick and Len have that on their face?  I know.  That doesn't make any sense.  One of their fans left it there.  What else are their fans saying?  Hope these douches wrap their lips around a shotgun with a toe trigger. 
[02:11:00]  This show is very lackluster.  Lackluster.  Oh, wow.  Somebody tried out a penis pump with a couple of his friends.  Oh, my God.  Also male.  Why would they have that on their Facebook page?  Oh, yes.  So one of their fans...  How's this going to bring in listeners?  ...is chiming in saying, nice voices, queer holes.  Uh, take your station and make it cider or something.  It's W-A-P-L, of course.  Oh, apple.  Oh, God.  General warts on a vagina. 
[02:11:30]  No, that's the blue waffle.  Come on.  Get it right.  Uh, picture of Black Earl.  Black Earl, of course.  Okay.  There's Chris Benoit.  Chris Benoit.  And we got to see, where's baby Hitler?  I'm sure baby Hitler will see.  The caption is, uh, picture Chris Benoit in his house, and the caption says, guess what  I'm doing tonight?  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  What would that be referencing?  I'm sure he was going to, uh...  I'm confused by that picture.  Kill his wife and eight-year-old child with his bare hands, I think. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  And then hang himself with his own weights.  Hang himself in his weight machine, yeah.  And Sam was telling me over the weekend that the WWE, at this point, you wouldn't even  know this guy ever was part of the organization.  They don't acknowledge him whatsoever.  At all.  Like, even, even when they're airing old shows from years ago that he was on, not only do  they cut his matches out, but they cut out the commentary that says, Chris Benoit  is going to be taking on so-and-so.  Oh, wow.  Any mention of his name is cut out.  Wow.  Like, when they bring up Randy Orton, and he was the youngest world champion ever, they 
[02:12:30]  don't mention who he won the belt from, which was Chris Benoit.  None of it.  Wow.  And that's important stuff to the wrestling community, obviously.  He was huge.  To know all those, uh, facts.  It's still real to me.  I wonder why.  Yeah, I guess because it's just a barbaric nature.  Yeah, they don't want to be at all associated with that.  Of course.  Magic Johnson wishes, uh, these guys AIDS, apparently, to one of the Rick and Lance.  That's nice.  What's that pig doing in that picture?  Taking a shit?  Yeah, it looks like the pig is taking a shit over his massive testicles.  Oh, God.  Can you imagine the smell of pig shit over a pig bowl? 
[02:13:00]  I didn't mean it like that.  It went hot.  Would you smell that area?  That'd be rough.  The Facebook, uh, the person's name is Jim Norton.  Oh, look at that.  I believe there's a, are people that are, they have lots of different names on Facebook, but  they keep using the same picture.  Yeah.  Because there's this one picture of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho looking at himself  in the mirror.  It was where he was pointing at the mirror, yeah, like, yeah.  But he's got like 50 different names with that same picture on this Facebook page.  Why could you handle animal shit for the most part? 
[02:13:30]  I'm saying handle it.  But when you smell human shit, it just fucking sets you off.  Well, what do you think of this picture for human shit?  Yeah, I, I, I, but seriously, what's the answer to that?  When you walk to a farm or something and you smell a whole bunch of different shit, pig  and all that, you, you know, it's a bit, maybe.  I'll tell you why.  Probably because the food they're eating is hay and much more organic things.  We're eating fucking processed food.  I'm guessing. 
[02:14:00]  When you smell human shit, though.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's definitely something about the, just the way we digest shit.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  The processed shit we eat?  Yeah, like, hay is a weird thing when they eat, like.  The horses.  Yeah.  Sam?  This is this picture.  I can't remember this porn star's name.  He's in everything.  That's, uh, something, is, I want to say it's Evan, uh, something.  Evan Stone?  Evan Stone.  And above it, it says, I'm going to fuck you.  Uh, picture.  Why would they have this on their Facebook page?  I don't know.  Some fan left him a picture of Bobo and Howard Stern, which, you know. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, they're good pals now.  Yeah, uh, David Lee Roth showing off his physique.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the, that's such a coincidence.  Oh, there it is.  It's the girl.  The scene that we just referenced on this show from Devil's Advocate, there's actually  a, a screen grab from that.  Right.  On their Facebook page.  Welcome to the dollhouse girl on the stand.  Uh, this show is the message, and there's a picture of a steaming pile of shit with  pitch under it.  Yeah.  Uh, let's, uh, get the Greyhound story out of the way. 
[02:15:00]  Uh, I guess we're going to learn about their chemistry here, Sam.  It's a picture of Scott and Todd.  Yes.  Yes, this is, this is a good example of the chemistry, because we looked at the chemistry  between Scott and Todd.  Yes.  This is the Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin chemistry.  Great chemistry.  Yeah.  Uh, remember, what was it?  I don't know, 15, 18 years ago now that, uh, we had the, uh, the Greyhound track.  Yeah.  Fox Valley, uh, Greyhound Park there in Kekana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was, that was a fun couple of months, wasn't it?  That was about it. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Well, the state used to have a bunch of them too, and now there are, what, none, or is  there still one left on there?  I don't know if there's any left.  Is that one of Kenosha still operating?  I'm not sure.  Could be.  I don't know.  But, uh, the fact is, I don't know why I bring this up, since obviously nobody around  here is really interested in Greyhound racing.  But I, I did find this to be an interesting item I ran across today.  Uh, a, uh, a dog, a Greyhound, racing Greyhound, named Jack Spratt from, uh, Wimbledon in England.  Uh, lost every single race he was in. 
[02:16:00]  They said that the dog in, uh, in practice seemed to be really, really fast, and yet lost  every single race.  Stand-alone dog?  Oh, shit.  Is he, yeah, yeah, it's a, Greyhound's usually a, stand-alone, huh?  Lost every race.  Race.  Lost every race.  Wow, that was uncomfortable. 
[02:16:30]  Well, that's all in the-  Oh, God, a prolapse anus.  There's a, is that a real picture?  That's how rosy red your asshole could get.  I don't know.  If it pops out.  Would you suck on that?  Ah!  Jesus.  Ah.  Live from the compound plugs.  Nice.  Bald, fat fucks.  There's a picture that says bald, fat fucks.  There's a picture of the guy from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  Yeah.  A picture of Homer from the Simpsons, and then Rick, and then Len.  Ah, yeah, they're right in there.  They are.  Oh, a big, shitty diaper blowout. 
[02:17:00]  This is the second part of the Greyhound story, Anthony.  It's going to get better.  Yeah, this is where the jokes come in.  Yes, of course.  That was the setup, right?  That was the setup.  Did it have some kind of, uh, I don't know, psychological issue?  Wouldn't chase the rabbit or something?  Well, it wasn't psychological.  Turns out he didn't see the rabbit.  Turns out after losing an entire season of races, they came to realize the dog was blind.  They didn't know the dog was blind.  They didn't realize the dog was blind.  So it's a blind Greyhound, yet they were entering it in parimutual races. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  Wow.  So, that would be the dog I would be betting on, you know?  Did it stay on the track?  I guess so.  You know, you probably follow the scent of the other dogs or whatever.  Something, yeah.  Yeah, follow that scent of the dog butt ahead of you.  And the key is for this dog, it was following, not leading.  Right, right, right.  They say that the dog was really fast, and the real problem was, is that he was slowed  down by his seeing-eye human. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, and then they just bam right out of it, right?  Well, we taught a lot of the folks out there.  You have to end on a big one.  You've got to go to commercials with a big one, a big laugh.  I actually experienced what you've experienced on this show, the butt head face.  Yeah, yeah.  When I was listening to this.  Well, the guy had no confidence because he did the, well, the, well, listen to the end.  And you've got to listen to the end again.  And you can tell right before he hits the sweeper that his partner will not laugh at that joke. 
[02:18:30]  No.  No.  He will give him nothing.  He had no confidence in it.  Listen to the end of this.  The dog was really fast, and the real problem was, is that he was, he was slowed down by  his seeing-eye human.  This is Rocky Everwood.  You can hear him hit the button.  You can hear him.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  There's a picture of me on there.  Should have heard him hitting the fucking plunger.  Why would their fans have a picture of me on there?  I meant on an explosive site. 
[02:19:00]  There he is.  There's a picture of a guy who puts his hand in shit.  A picture of Jim Norton wearing a t-shirt that says, bitches don't know about my monster  reign.  Oh, nice cum shot.  Come done.  Fez has made another site from the homeless shopping spree.  He's good how dogs can't stand alone.  They really need a picture of E-Rog with stained underwear.  They really need a music bed, those guys.  Yes.  Is that the guy blowing himself?  The luckiest man in the world. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, this guy's blowing himself.  Pretty damn impressive.  Jesus.  He's only sucking the head, though.  How long, how long do you think, oh, fool.  All right, well, that one was a little.  How long do you think before they, how long do you think before they shut the site down?  I don't know.  There's some really bad stuff on here.  You know, people have to look and go like, what the fuck happened?  We never, this never happens on Facebook.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  This should be flying for a crime. 
[02:20:00]  That erases him now.  Someone's going to lose their Facebook page today.  Someone's going to lose their Facebook page today.  That's horrible.  You can't do that.  That's horrible.  Someone's losing their Facebook page.  Shit, that's a good one.  I hope it was worth it, sir.  That's horrible.  You got us laughing pretty hard, but you're going to lose that page today.  Jesus.  Let me see that again.  Fuck, that is funny, man. 
[02:20:30]  TV's officially on the floor.  Oh, wowie.  They're all fucked up.  That's great.  All right, listen.  It's Jacktober with Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin.  It's time for the news, honey.  Baby Hitler.  News honey time.  Yeah?  Gene Anthony stops by and does a story on Michael Jackson.  Len adds a lot. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, Len adds a lot, which I usually, judging by what Sam does, means nothing.  Well, it doesn't add a lot.  And you should take notice that because this is an edgy rock, I'm trying to reload the page  so I don't look at a prolapsed dog anus.  Yeah.  Yes, you're correct.  This is an edgy station.  Yeah.  It's the news honey, not just some news lady.  What does she look like?  Is there a picture of the news honey on the website?  There is not, which is a bad sign.  Please go back to those pictures.  It's a very bad sign they don't have a picture of the news honey on their website. 
[02:21:30]  Not a good sign.  There's too many pictures.  Loads of shit in the toilet.  And people just posting the same.  The teeth in my feet.  That is great.  Oh, people are awful.  It's the Rick and Len show on Facebook.  You should know that by now.  He's here again.  That woman.  Yeah.  Well, hi there.  Nice to see you.  News honey, Jeannie Anthony with the headlines.  What's up? 
[02:22:00]  Prosecutors in Los Angeles are trying to show that Michael Jackson's doctor delayed calling  authorities and hid his alleged giving the pop star a dangerous and powerful drug.  The first bodyguard to reach Jackson's room will testify about that today.  Conrad Murray is accused of involuntary manslaughter.  It's kind of weird.  One of the guards at Michael's ranch said that Murray asked him not to call 911.  And then he says Murray was in Jackson's bedroom trying to revive him and asking if anyone knew CPR. 
[02:22:30]  The doctor.  Dr. Murray asking if anyone knew CPR.  Nice.  That's a good sign, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a, yeah.  I'll give you $150,000 a month to be my personal physician.  What?  You don't know CPR?  I want my money back.  Yeah, I remember back when the Jackson story first broke.  You made an excellent point about personal physicians.  I'm sure I did.  Yeah.  Wow.  How long have these two been working together?  Like a month? 
[02:23:00]  Well, no.  There is no rapport and no, like, communication skills.  They've both been in radio for a long time, and they did different roles before.  So I think the one guy is just fed up with the other guy.  Oh, is that what it is?  He doesn't want to give him shit.  He's not giving him anything.  Probably because management put him together or something.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  But so.  That's silence.  So that last story was about the personal physician, right?  Yeah.  So Jeannie, the news honey, gets into her next story. 
[02:23:30]  But Rick doesn't want to let that go, because he's thought of some good humor based on it.  Oh, he finally got some humor out of the last one.  Oh, right.  So he's going to go back to the last story.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  And here's your happy story.  Oh, a happy story?  It doesn't have animals in it.  A Frank Lloyd Wright house has been put on the market in Milwaukee.  The three-bedroom house is listed at just under $200,000.  It was built around 1916.  So if you want a Frank Lloyd Wright, you have an opportunity.  There's another unsold house on the market in Wisconsin.  That's the happy story?  I'm trying to give this a twist. 
[02:24:00]  You know, here's the thing about Frank Lloyd Wright houses.  I mean, they're awfully cool looking.  I love the design, you know, the mission stuff and everything that Frank Lloyd Wright does.  But the problem with the Frank Lloyd Wright houses, I mean, yeah, he was a great architect  and everything, but he couldn't make a roof that doesn't leak.  Well, that's going to help him sell the house now.  Thanks a lot.  I'm just saying.  So, yeah, personal physicians.  You know what I'd like to have?  I'd like to have a personal musician.  Really?  Yeah, if at any, you know, at some point you're walking down the street, oh, you know what 
[02:24:30]  would be cool?  Yeah.  Play me this one.  You know?  What?  You understand?  Instead of personal physician, personal musician.  Musician.  You understand.  Somebody that would play music for you.  There's a fucking hilarious picture that somebody put up for all of us.  This is so funny.  Somebody made a Photoshop for Jocktober that they left on Rick and Len's Facebook page  that's Photoshopped everybody on the show into gay positions. 
[02:25:00]  With jockstraps on.  Wearing jockstraps.  There's a big fat guy in a jockstrap.  Of course, E-Rock's head has been put on that.  Roland's up there in his Bruce T-shirt and a thong.  Big fat black guy facing the other way.  He says, where are you going, Patrice?  There's a picture of actually Jim on all fours and me, looks like, getting ready to  eat his assholes.  Eat Jim's ass.  And of course...  Is that Opie sniffing the jock?  That's Opie sniffing his own jock.  And Ant, while his penis is far too big. 
[02:25:30]  It says, mine doesn't fit.  For the jockstrap.  And the cup from the jock is just dangling on the end of my dick.  And of course...  There's dopey Club Soda Kenny with a jockstrap on his head.  Yeah, the cartoon.  Holy shit.  That's funny, man.  People are fucking...  Not as funny as the bit we just heard.  Yeah.  He wants a personal...  A personal musician.  So when you're walking down the street, you go, hey, personal musician, I want to hear  this right now.  It's like a personal physician, but musician.  It's a great concept, Sam. 
[02:26:00]  By the way...  Uh-oh.  This is Jeannie.  Oh, boy.  That's the news, honey?  Yep.  News, honey.  What?  Let me make it a little bigger for you.  What?  That's right.  I think she's big enough.  What?  Oh, wow.  She looks like Joe Clecko.  I was hoping that would work, because Joe hasn't been around in a while.  Yeah, but we all remember Joe Clecko.  Gene Anthony, the news, honey, looks like Joe Clecko in a red wig. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  No?  Gene Anthony.  Yes.  Wasn't he part of the New York SAC exchange?  Give me a side-by-side with Joe Clecko.  Wow, the news, honey.  Brutal looking.  Wow.  That is a manly, manly woman.  Wow.  I wonder if anybody's going to be commenting about Joe Clecko.  Oh, well.  Oh, no.  Let's take a look at Joe Clecko.  She does. 
[02:27:00]  Look at the fucking...  You got to get a little younger of her.  I just hope they don't put, like, embarrassing photoshops.  I know.  Oh, my God.  What a fucking...  What the hell is that?  Oh, my God.  That's insane.  Oh, God.  It really does look similar.  Joe Clecko.  Boy, they foggied up that picture of her, too, didn't they?  You take that hair away, you would swear you're looking at a guy.  Yeah, that's a guy face.  She got a guy face.  She got a guy face.  The news, honey.  The news, honey.  If you're going to be in radio and call yourself the news, honey, and shit like that, and portray yourself 
[02:27:30]  like that...  Right.  No pics.  No pictures.  Let's see the...  Or pics behind the tree.  We've talked about this.  Yeah, with sunglasses on.  Sunglasses.  Just peering out.  One eye peering.  I think it was.  One eye.  I think it was one sunglassed eye.  There's Joe Clecko.  It's already on their Facebook.  I believe from one of the...  I thought there was some kind of delay on this.  How could it be that quick on their Facebook page?  Joe Clecko.  Let's see that line.  I think Joe Clecko was in one of those movies, like Hal Needham and Burr Reynolds movies  or some shit.  Yeah, he made some appearances.  Joe Clecko, by the way, looks completely retarded. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, she's not good.  Nah, nah.  That's MySpace voodoo she's doing there.  Yeah, she's looking up at her eyes.  Got that camera up high.  Yeah, that's not good, man.  She's a pig.  Rick and Len, more like Dick and Phlegm.  Oh, Joe.  Oh.  Why don't we break...  Shaving is...  Why don't we break, because we're going into the big marquee bit that they do, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  So we'll do part two of Jocktober with Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin. 
[02:28:30]  Oh.  You thought they wouldn't come back from the personal musician bit.  Oh, no.  That was a good bit.  That's what I mean.  Good concept.  That was great, but...  I'm sure they did an hour of phones on that.  Yeah, personal.  Musician.  Marquee.  Can I tease the marquee bit?  No.  After the break, Ant, as we look at Rick and Len for Jocktober, they're going to do their  marquee bit, which is rock band, racehorse, or porn film.  Ah, I bet I know what this is all about. 
[02:29:00]  This is the O.P.A. Anthony Channel.  Doi bu qi, wo mii le lu, qiing ni bong mao.  On Sirius XM.  And now a reading from the book of Ted.  When the wine was gone, Ted had his disciples fill the drugs with water, and then a miracle  occurred.  And Ted said,  I took water, and I turned it into crystal light.  The wine was now crystal light.  When the food was gone, Ted's disciples gathered, and the Lord Ted proclaimed, 
[02:29:30]  I took a bunch of fishes, and turned it into more fishes, by cutting them in half.  I have 30 fishes, and I should present E with 60 half-fishes.  It was the second miracle Ted had performed, and Ted then divided the fish among them.  I'm working miracles!  The king was not impressed, and ordered Ted to be arrested.  Oh no!  They misunderstood me!  Ted shouted, as he tried to explain himself.  I had an erection!  It was tenting out of my robe, beautifully!  But the guards just ignored him, and Ted was taken away. 
[02:30:00]  The Lord Ted was to be crucified.  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting!  Ted shouted, as the nails were driven into his flesh.  As the crowd looked on, Ted looked to the people and announced,  I have it!  I have it not!  You go with spores!  Whatever that means.  This has been a reading from the book of Ted.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opinetry Show!  In the middle of Jack-tober, we're featuring Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin. 
[02:30:30]  Oh yeah, they're good.  What's their show called again, Sam?  It's just Rick and Len in the morning.  No, no, I mean, I meant to say the radio station.  WAPL, Wisconsin's rock station.  And they gave themselves that title. 
[02:31:00]  Oh yes, yes, yes.  I love that.  That takes balls.  Oh, there's somebody that just shit their pants, is that what that is?  Yeah, they're trying to delete things off their Facebook page,  but the fans are just coming in too strong and too fast.  Too fast.  Too strong right now?  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If I ran a radio station, I would just call it the only radio station.  You might as well, right?  It's like, well, wait a minute, there are other stations.  Ah, we're the only radio stations.  See, radio can't think out of the box, but I would actually do that 
[02:31:30]  and get everyone talking to town.  Like, how dare they call themselves the only radio station?  We're the only radio station.  Why does it have to be the only radio station that does something?  Right, just call it the only radio station.  None other.  All right.  Marquee bit time.  I hate.  Oh my God.  Yeah, that's funny.  But he didn't actually have that sign, right?  That's what I hear.  No, it had something else.  It had something else.  I hate your sign.  That was super, that was put in in post.  I wish I could say the word as easy as you. 
[02:32:00]  Why don't you?  You're reading something off of.  I don't know.  I just can't.  I'm not saying, you know, I just can't.  If it's not used in a, you know, derogatory way.  It's like any other, here's the thing.  If you're actually quoting something.  I'm not saying it's wrong, by the way.  No, no, no.  I just, I just, I like, I kind of skate around it a little bit still.  Yeah, I have no issue with it.  I wouldn't say it to be a dick, or if there was a black guy here, I wouldn't try to squeeze  it in.  But if I'm quoting the name of a prior album, it's called Bicentennial Nigger.  I'm not going to pretend it's not. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  Yeah, not saying Bicentennial N-word.  Yeah, I'm comfortable saying it, because I know my motives for saying it.  Gotcha.  But what's the story with the Bruce Willis song?  I heard that was, the sign said something else, and they put that in at the end.  I don't know exactly what they put in.  I mean, what it said when they, I think because Artie Fuqua, who's a buddy of mine, he's a comic,  he hosts at the Cellar all the time, was in that scene, or he was there for that scene.  I believe Artie just wanted to tell me that, yeah.  Really?  Yes.  I love Artie.  Yeah, he's a Greek funny dick.  Has he knocked anyone out lately?  No, but he has a giant penis.  That's legendary. 
[02:33:00]  Artie Fuqua.  Well, those people tend to have big ones.  Yeah, but Artie is a big dick, even for a black guy.  Him and Kevin Hart.  Kevin Hart is a big one?  Fucking.  Did you see it?  No, but everyone who's seen it has told me.  It's fucking massive.  Keith Robinson pulled a train with him years ago.  God damn it, your dick is too big.  God damn it.  Add some dick.  According to Keith.  Keith said that, I don't know if he really pulled a train with him, but he said that.  Who knows?  Maybe Keith just saw his penis and he was embarrassed.  I would assume Keith has a big one. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, he does.  And because Florentine has pulled trains with Keith.  He said Keith is so abusive when he fucks girls, and his dick always curves to the left.  But Keith will actually just talk to waitresses and say, you're going to get the big boy.  So then I start chiming in, telling him how my friend is going to give you the big boy.  I love talking about Keith and the big boy.  You back him up.  Yeah, of course.  Big boy.  Some people are posting on Rick and Len's show Facebook page about what a snazzy dresser  Troy Kwan is.  Troy Kwan is a fancy dresser.  Just ask him.  I'm hoping he's appreciating. 
[02:34:00]  I went with a layer look today.  I hope Troy appreciates it.  I went with a t-shirt underneath my shirt.  And a jacket on top of it.  Not Troy Kwan approved, I'd say.  It's all about layering.  I'm learning.  Got to layer your clothes.  I don't know.  I don't think Troy would like that.  Marquee bit time, man.  It's rock band, racehorse, or porn film.  I guess they play something.  With an unenthusiastic listener.  Oh, God.  The listeners don't even want to fucking get up for the show.  No.  I threw the disc away. 
[02:34:30]  Could someone look around?  You threw the disc away?  It's on the floor.  Oh, boy.  Sorry.  I threw the disc away.  Sorry.  For the segment we're doing.  You have to take care of your things a little better than that.  I thought we were done.  I really did.  How could we be done?  We went to commercial.  How could we be done?  We went to commercials.  I thought we were done.  All right.  Marquee bit time.  Rick and Lange.  October.  APL in Wisconsin.  WAPL. 
[02:35:00]  Rock band, racehorse.  Racehorse or porn film.  105.  7 WAPL is the Rick and Lange show.  A couple minutes before 7 o'clock.  50 degrees.  Who gets to play a rock band, racehorse or porn film today?  Well, I'll be darned.  It's Paul Van Boxtel.  Hello, Paul.  Good morning.  Paul, do you know how this works?  Unfortunately, yes.  Oh, wow.  Unfortunately, yes.  Unfortunately, yes.  It fucking sucks.  Dumb show.  Dumb game.  Anthony Bryan wants to know if, what did Opie say on BAB? 
[02:35:30]  The only rock station that really rocks.  No, that's when me and Ant were doing AAF in Boston.  We were the only station that really rocks.  BAB was the home of rock and roll, you dunce.  And I've worked at three homes of rock and roll in three different cities.  And I worked at an animal station, the Fox.  The Fox.  Did everything have to be Fox-themed?  Oh, yeah.  The Fox-trot.  Yeah, that would be like...  I don't remember the Fox themes, but yeah, they were all over the fucking place.  That would absolutely be if they were going to do a marathon for charity. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Make sure you join the Fox-trot.  We're going to be doing...  I really don't remember the Fox themes anymore, but I do vaguely remember we had a lot of them.  When did radio just start to fucking stink?  Well, no.  No?  No, I would have never got into this horseshit business if that was the case.  I mean, just starting.  When radio...  Do you really want the answer?  Yeah, sure.  It's going to bore the shit out of people.  But it was probably around 88, 89 when the radio industry itself and the government accepted LMAs. 
[02:36:30]  They were called LMAs, and I don't remember what they stand for anymore.  But basically, it meant you could own more than one FM in a city.  But technically, you didn't own them.  You were kind of renting the other station.  There was like a little loophole in the fucking rules.  So it's basically when the big corporation started to have more than one...  Yes.  Okay.  Then it didn't matter as much.  Good man.  Then it didn't matter as much. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  You owned all the rock stations.  So who gives a fuck?  No one was really competing anymore and beating the shit out of each other.  That's when it really started.  That's what I think.  That was when it jumped the shark.  Oh, that's terrible.  When they allowed LMAs.  And I think it was 89, I want to guess.  So here we go.  Back to the marquee bit from Rick and Len.  Yes.  Unfortunately, it may help you win.  You know, Paul, if you really don't want to play, you don't have to.  All right.  Yes, I do.  All right.  Here we go.  Seven names and titles.  Each of them is either a rock band or racehorse or a porn film. 
[02:37:30]  You need to get four of seven correct to win tickets to the Rock and Apple Clash at the Creek.  If you go seven for seven, you win that $26 cash bonus.  Here we go.  Okay.  Number one.  Sticky Kitty.  Sticky Kitty.  Rock band.  Racehorse.  Huh?  Or porn film.  Uh-oh.  No, not Kitty.  Porn film.  Kitty.  Not Kitty.  See, that's different.  It's a porno movie.  Sticky Kitty.  I thought it was Sticky Kitty.  Oh, my God.  I didn't even pick up on that one.  Sure.  Jesus.  They're trying to delete comments as they go. 
[02:38:00]  How's that working out for them?  Not well.  I mean, they've just...  We're just following their lead.  We went to their Facebook page and saw a couple of little edgy things, so that's all.  Yeah.  Because as...  We're just adding to their edge.  They can't get down to the bottom of where the comments are, because every time they delete  a group of comments, just as many pop up again.  Yeah.  On the Rick and Len Show Facebook page.  At least they have more positive comments, though.  They do work on...  Let's see.  Wisconsin's rock station.  Oh, God.  Bottom line, you guys suck.  You guys are good at radio. 
[02:38:30]  This is going great.  Happy birthday to Jim.  Happy birthday to Jimmy or something.  Picture two men sleeping on each other.  Gay old men.  Mike check.  Did you block us yet?  And these are from like 17 minutes ago.  Yeah.  So they wiped out like 10 minutes worth of comments, but they can't keep up.  They so don't want to shut it down.  No.  Rick and Len eat ass.  Rick and Len love a good pink sock. 
[02:39:00]  And this picture has been posted a dozen times.  They keep deleting it, and it keeps getting posted again.  I want to play turkey foot with Rick and Len.  It's very cute.  You love the dumb little things they pick up on.  This page is disgusting.  I am Uncle Paul'd.  As opposed to a Paul'd.  Well, we figured that out, so...  We're not as dumb as we look.  I don't think you're dumb.  Thanks, sir.  What's with the pics, guys?  I would report them to Ted Sheckler at the FCC. 
[02:39:30]  I love the updated Rick and Len.  Really edgy stuff, guys.  Rick and Len eat ass.  Hacks.  More Rick and Len love a good pink sock photos.  I mean, the hits keep coming.  Put on a lot of good pinks.  Queers, writes one fan.  It's going to be a long day.  You need to go to Ted Sheckler's anti-Facebook bomb Emporium or something.  That's a twofer right there of characters. 
[02:40:00]  A lot.  A homo.  This show is Jocktober approved staple.  I keep fingering my ass to your awesomeness.  Great show today, guys.  Any more material from these two?  Yeah.  We just had the benchmark.  It doesn't sound like a stop.  I'll stop whenever you tell me to.  All right.  Can you stop now?  You got it.  All right.  Because we've got to find out what Sticky Kitty's all about.  That's right.  What do you guys think?  Rock band, racehorse, or who gives a flying fuck? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Who gives a shit?  I know what I think.  Oh.  Okay.  We're not going to wait for you to use your computer here, Paul.  Just make a guess.  I'm pulled off on the side of the road.  So, rock band.  Ah, good job.  Good deliberation on your part, I guess.  Wow.  They really just, no one seemed into that.  I've seen a lot of vile photos.  I think that one really is bothersome.  That's real bad.  That one is bothersome. 
[02:41:00]  That looks like two fucking old truck drivers.  It's just a big, fat, old guy, and another guy who's just going to start, I guess, giving  him a blowjob.  He's got a little one, too.  He's got a, well, the fat is puffed up around his dick, so he's almost jerking him off with  just a thumb and forefinger.  I'm bothered by that guy's stance.  He's very confident.  He's leaning on one arm, and he's got the other arm on his hip as his pants are down 
[02:41:30]  to his knees.  His face looks like he should be saying, good evening.  It's like an Alfred Little Cock.  What happened there?  Did we get the answer?  Yeah, it turned out it was a rock band.  Oh, that's terrific.  Game continues, Ann, unfortunately.  Number two, Meat Monsters.  How about Meat Monsters?  Meat Monsters.  That's a porno.  Great horse.  No, that's a porn film.  Number three. 
[02:42:00]  Lady Gaga loves that movie.  Number three, Panty Pops.  Excuse me?  Panty Pops.  That's a porno.  That's a rock band.  If that was a rock band, I'd go see it.  It's a rock band.  But it's a movie.  It's a porn film.  I'm patting a thousand of you.  It's like making cum-sicles.  It's like you enjoy this game.  Yeah.  It's great.  It's fun.  It's good, clean fun.  Are you going to make a man-cow call to them and play along?  I should.  You would do very well.  I know.  I think I'd be a good caller. 
[02:42:30]  What's that, young Sam?  The 105.7 WAPL Facebook page is now also under attack.  Oh, boy.  Oh, their Facebook page, too.  That's not good.  Bill Tetley would like to have you as guests on the Bill Tetley Variety Hour.  Nice.  Uh, I love listening to Rick finger-bang Lenny.  Reminds me of Rick finger-banging Lenny.  Uh, let's see.  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Hmm. 
[02:43:00]  Uh, there's a picture of a horse taking a shit.  Wow.  Uh, the Wizard of Oz, except every character's face has been replaced with Gary Busey.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah.  I haven't seen that one before.  It's just all Gary Busey.  Uh, guy fully decked out in a rainbow outfit that says, you are this gay.  Uh, of course, the Hail Kumia flag is flying.  Uh, what the fuck is this shit, one person wants to know.  More, uh, Gary Busey and horses shitting. 
[02:43:30]  Love you guys love the show.  Well, of course, Hulk Hogan causing the World Trade Center to come crashing down.  With my favorite picture, where are you going?  I did this for you.  Uh, they should, like, ask him if it's a movie or a song or something.  Um, uh, kiddie pictures.  People are arguing when radio got destroyed.  1996 ruined radio telecommunications act.  I'm, I'm saying where it began.  I go to the roots of the problem.  Yes.  Yeah.  We still sort of, uh, survived, uh, from 88 on, but that was the start of the fall of 
[02:44:00]  really good, solid radio.  Yeah.  I guess by 96, it was really out of control.  So I guess you're right, Jim.  I think we're both right in that one.  Oh, look at that one, you and your little Hitler.  It's not a doll.  It's an action figure.  I'm sorry.  Kurt Love lost his Facebook page as a casualty to Jocktober.  Oh, boy.  But some guy named Kurt Love's Pests is, uh, yeah, Kurt Love, his IP address was banned  from Facebook.  Why?  Oh, wow.  Because of inappropriate comments on multiple pages. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, no.  Can I bring that up for a second?  I got people mad at me on Twitter, like, oh, I lost my Facebook page.  I'm like, I didn't, you gotta figure out.  We're not telling you to do that.  You gotta figure out the risk here.  This, this, you could lose your Facebook page over some of this.  There's some personal responsibility.  Thank you, Sam.  Block your IP address and he can do it.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, I wouldn't want anybody to lose that page.  There are some real disgusting fucking pictures.  Oh!  What happened?  Okay, we've gotten, we've gotten past phase one. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Where now public posting is banned, so now only they can post, but you all can comment  on their posts.  You can comment on their posts still?  Oh, yeah.  This is phase two.  I eat a dick sandwich.  Which then goes into phase three, which is them shutting down the whole thing.  Wait, is this, uh, the Rick and Len, uh, Facebook page?  This is the Rick and Len show Facebook page.  We're at phase two.  We're at phase two.  Uh, they did a news story about the Packers.  Uh, comments include, my bottle sack smells like Framunda cheese.  Uh, the Packers are a bunch of green and yellow queers. 
[02:45:30]  Uh, the Packers are so good they can only be limited by their imaginations.  Hi, Rick.  Last night was amazing.  I can't believe you took all nine inches.  Wow.  Call you later, honey.  I'm a kind of fan.  That makes you laugh.  Quick hit the sweeper.  Uh,  Fuck Ron Bennington.  Fuck Ron Bennington.  Roofs that don't leak.  Ha.  Classic.  Ted Jefferson said that.  Maybe you guys ought to get some hair or something. 
[02:46:00]  What kind of cheese goes good on a cock meat sandwich?  You guys stink like where the poopy comes out.  These guys are fucked up.  Blueberries are a standalone fruit.  Chip for president or something.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Twatto leakage.  Sit Ubu.  Uh, ah, this show is like seminal fluids seeping.  Seepage.  Flowing like a river ghost.  Oh, that's a...  Ah, this show is like seminal fluids seepage. 
[02:46:30]  Flowing like a river.  Lemon party.  Tis, AIDS, Tis.  Jim Norton rules.  Chip, what's that, does too.  Uh, AIDS.  Amazing.  Yeah, look at that.  We're deep into phase two.  Deep into phase two.  All right.  Let's, uh, continue, Ant, because the game continues.  Oh, thank God.  Just don't bother them on Twitter, because you've got to give them some of these.  Uh, number four.  Box maker.  Box maker.  That's a horse.  Race horse.  There you go.  You've got two correct.  You need two more to win.  I'm fucking...  Uh, let's see.  I got a moral so far. 
[02:47:00]  Number five, fun in a bun.  Fun in a bun.  Rock band.  Race horse or porn film?  Fun in a bun is race horse.  Rock band.  Ah!  No, it's a porn film.  Goddamn my first time.  Why do you got to get the last two here to win?  You can do it.  Ergasmic.  Air-gasmic.  Rock band.  Race horse or porn film?  Come on.  That's a rock band.  Race horse.  Oh.  That's a porn film.  Yeah.  I'll try the last one just to see if I can get at least three correct.  Choke me again.  Choke me again.  A rock band, race horse, or porn film? 
[02:47:30]  Rock band.  No, that's a race horse.  Well, only two correct.  I'll tell you what.  We'll get you consolation prize.  How about we send you to McDonald's for lunch or dinner?  That sounds good.  McDonald's.  I'm loving it.  Thanks, Paul.  Hang on.  Oh.  Somebody posted the mulleted picture of Club Soda Kenny on the WAPL page.  And I'm getting word.  Why would you just go through the motions like that?  Then blow off the bit.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you just blow off the bit at that point?  Yeah.  It's useless.  No one cares. 
[02:48:00]  Listeners aren't into it, and the fucking hosts certainly aren't into it.  Brett Favre has a tiny dick tip.  Anthony sucks at this game.  Ramone, give me a radio show.  I could suck a dick.  Your mom's box.  Don't try and fight it, shit dicks.  I'm not going to read everyone, Bill Chipperson.  Bill Chipperson sure is putting a lot up there.  Is he writing a lot of stuff?  Yeah.  Sam hates.  I'm not going to read.  I'm not going to blindly read.  Mighty Horse rocks a fat ass.  I'm eating cantaloupe, but I'm gay, so I can't elope. 
[02:48:30]  This is...  Oh, Chip.  Okay, you guys let us alone, you big New York bad guys.  I'm assuming that's one of ours.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Lots of AIDS.  Quack, quack, tits in the ass, cuntour.  Now they just fucking start writing cuntour.  I shit my pants. 
[02:49:00]  It's too bad we're done, Sam.  I wouldn't be so sure of that.  What?  I think that's unfair of you to declare to the listeners.  Rick and Len talk about a billboard and tease a bit.  What's this about?  Hello, Bill.  Well, there's a billboard insulting cheese in Wisconsin.  What?  That's right.  How dare they?  That's right.  And Rick and Len wanted to talk about the billboard and then they tease a bit that I don't want you to read what the next track is because I'd rather you hear them tease it.  Oh, cool. 
[02:49:30]  That's right.  Let me go to Dan in Appleton.  There's a lot of Appleton calls coming.  Where's Appleton?  Wisconsin, I guess.  WAPL.  Oh, they're in Appleton County or something?  Dan, what do you got?  I live in the city of Appleton, actually a couple of blocks away from the radio station.  These guys have been on the air in Wisconsin.  They're legendary out here.  They've been on the air together for like 25 years.  The WAPL is probably the only radio station anybody listens to.  I can't stand it.  They've been playing the same eight songs for 30 years. 
[02:50:00]  But I just called them and I was on the phone with Len and he said at least the five people that subscribe to Satellite Radio are listening to you guys right now.  Yeah.  All right.  That's proof by the Facebook page getting completely destroyed.  The five people listening to Satellite Radio just shut down this station's Facebook page.  Not the show's Facebook page.  The entire station's Facebook page has been taken off Facebook.  Congratulations.  And I try to downplay this by obviously the way I dress and other things. 
[02:50:30]  But I will give Len a call right now and let's look at each other's bank accounts in the last seven years.  Just the last seven years.  Just the last seven.  Me and you can make that call too.  Last seven years.  Where we've talked to five subscribers for the last seven years.  So obviously he's had to make a boatload of money on regular radio.  Living there though because it was probably a lot cheaper.  Yeah.  We can't.  You can't take.  They have to say something. 
[02:51:00]  I mean they have to respond somehow.  Yeah.  You're right.  We are pieces of shit.  No.  I think they should just take it.  I think they should just take it.  Joe Mike Baker leaves a comment on their Facebook.  By the way the show's Facebook page is still open.  You have to comment on their posts.  That says Paul's mom makes a killer key lime pie.  Well Sam.  I don't like that.  Why'd you bring that up?  You know who the champion is.  Who did it say you hated?  Well I'm not going to tell you.  You read it.  And Sam.  Started with an N though. 
[02:51:30]  You can't deny that Paul's mom is the fucking champion.  Of what?  Of the key lime pie competition.  I guess.  And soon to be the champion of the peanut butter cookies.  I don't know anything about that.  Your mom's a no-show so far.  My mom's a no-show.  It's not my problem.  My mom's a show.  I'll say.  Let's learn about this billboard.  Rick and Len.  We've been hearing about this billboard in just near Lambeau and De Pere.  Man the controversy started even before the billboard was up.  Yeah.  Because the group that put up the anti-cheese billboard. 
[02:52:00]  The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine actually sent out a press release about it and kind of got the juices flowing well in advance when the billboard went up on Tuesday on Creamery Road.  Visible from Highway 41 there.  It's a Creamery Road.  Creamery Road.  Creamery Road.  They fucking love their cheese.  I know.  Enough with the lactose out there, you fucking horrible Wisconsin farts.  Enough already.  Someone's got to explain the whole cheese thing in Wisconsin.  How bad does it really get? 
[02:52:30]  Do they make it out there?  You think they have cheese on just everything?  It is just the cheesiest thing.  Well, we don't know.  None of us have ever been there.  No.  How bad is it?  I think it's pretty bad.  Do they have like cheese bars and shit?  Like San Francisco has a lot of wine bars because, you know, you've got wine country close by.  You've got to loosen up with some wine.  The bottle goes in fucking big in first.  Facebook comments.  Greetings from the five satellite subscribers, you fat boars.  Look at the five subscribers shutting down your Facebook pages, cunts. 
[02:53:00]  Yay, I'm number six.  Hope you drown in a, of course, puddle of AIDS.  Yes.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  We fucking hang it or what?  Wait, is it a knapsack joke?  Yeah.  That's a fucking brewer metallic.  Because we just played this thing.  Oh, we played it?  Yeah.  We fucking hang it or what?  We fucking hang it or what?  So the subscribers are chiming in.  All right, cheese billboard.  Visible from Highway 41 there.  It says cheese will sack your health. 
[02:53:30]  Fat, cholesterol, sodium.  And then it has their little logo on the bottom.  And up on the left side, it's got the Grim Reaper.  Originally, it was going to have the foam cheese head hat on until the folks who make those,  Foamation, started talking about, hey, we're going to have our attorneys contact you guys.  And so they kind of took the overt foam cheese head off.  You can still sort of see it.  Yeah, they kind of airbrushed it out.  It's like a silhouette of the foam cheese head.  You can't tell it's an actual Foamation brand cheese head.  But, yeah, a lot of people taking numbers. 
[02:54:00]  The Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board hates it.  Mayor Jim Schmidt of Green Bay hates it.  Well, we're not going to stand for it.  No.  We have our musical response to their billboard, and that's coming up next.  I actually sing on it, but don't let that keep you from tuning in.  Did they just set up a song parody?  You know it.  I don't think I've ever heard a radio station set up a song parody.  It was a tease for a song parody. 
[02:54:30]  Well, I should say a tease.  Right.  You could set up a song parody, but to actually tease it through a break, wow, it must be good.  When they said they were going to take it on, like they weren't going to stand for it,  I thought maybe bra bombing was going to go down.  Oh, no.  Well, it's always a possibility.  You never know with these wacky DJs.  You never know.  By the way, the word AIDS is just said actually now hundreds of times.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Over and over in their Facebook comments.  I think they're copy and pasting.  I think so.  One other says five listeners, like you're on a can in a string telephone. 
[02:55:00]  Got him.  Good one.  So got him.  All right, here we go.  People want, I got to know about the cheese.  Blake in Wisconsin.  Blake.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, there's a castle when you first drive into Wisconsin.  It's like the size of like an acre large full of cheese inside.  It's shaped like a Renaissance Fair Castle, and the state paid for the damn thing.  And it's made out of cheese?  No, the castle itself is made out of stone, but it's filled with cheese. 
[02:55:30]  Filled with cheese.  Why is it filled with cheese?  I guess people from Illinois want to come up and buy cheese from us.  The other day we were up at the racetrack, and I saw one of those Sargento trucks driving  by, and my dad pokes me, and he goes, you know those always travel in twos.  I have no idea what that means.  Sargento trucks all the time.  I enjoy a little cheese.  Absolutely.  It seems like you guys might have gone hog wild with your cheese up there.  How do you not, like, throw in a little Swiss on your ham sandwich?  Sammich.  But, yeah.  I want to know more about the obnoxious cheese culture up there. 
[02:56:00]  Anthony?  Oh, well, yes.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, will you unblock me on Twitter?  No.  What's your name on Twitter?  The Fire Builds.  We've had this discussion before.  I don't remember.  What did you do?  Oh, yeah, man.  You were supposed to give this guy another shot.  What did you say that Anthony didn't like?  You must remember.  I got involved in one of these other a-holes.  I think I got blocked in a big sweep of jerks.  I never unblocked them.  Who are you friends with?  I don't do any...  You might be friends with some bad people.  Yeah, people that like your show.  What do you think? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, but they're bad people.  There's bad Americans, aren't there?  No reprieves.  I won't name names.  No reprieves, no pardons, no nothing.  No.  Because if I block somebody, it's absolutely because they deserved it for a reason.  You know what?  I'm going to unblock some people today.  Wow.  How do you know who you've blocked?  Is there a block list?  I don't know.  I think you can't look at a list of everyone you have blocked.  You have to get like a third-party software for that, though.  Yes.  Who doesn't like a party?  Hmm? 
[02:57:00]  What?  Falling for that?  I like it, Jimmy.  He goes, hmm?  Please say it again.  This is the funny thing to say.  Who doesn't like a party?  What do you mean?  Let's go to Nick Wisconsin.  That's his last name.  Wisconsin.  Hey, it's Nick Wisconsin.  Nick Wisconsin.  What's up?  How are you doing today, guys?  Good.  Yeah, I'm a transplant from New Jersey, but when I moved there...  Is that a plant with a breast and a penis? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, that's exactly.  I had a breast put in the place of my penis.  All right.  You know, when I was up there, my wife was like, you've got to try cheese curds.  Cheese curds.  Oh, didn't Saddam Hussein cheese bomb them?  Cheese curds.  Oh, that's...  Wow.  Wow.  That was a laugh out loud, man.  I like that one.  They're everywhere.  They're like impulse items.  They're little lumps of cheese that don't go through the full processing to be shaped square. 
[02:58:00]  It's like a cheese miscarriage.  Everywhere, dude.  And as far as that cheese castle goes, that cheese castle, it costs millions of dollars.  And they built it because people travel from Chicago, from Minnesota, they travel from  all over just to go to that cheese castle and buy cheese.  Why?  You could get in a supermarket.  I'd go in there just to smell the cheese.  Can you sample the cheese?  I don't like Wisconsin cheese, so cheese, you know, that's... 
[02:58:30]  Why?  We got a nice market called Fairway in our neighborhood, and they have a great cheese section.  Why would you have to go to a castle?  I love Fairway.  In Wisconsin.  In Wisconsin.  Why would you drive, you know, that far just to go to a cheese castle?  How much cheese do you need?  I don't know, man.  Are you tired of your shit coming out nice and easy?  You want to block it?  Nice big block of cheese to cut your shit right in half?  They must pay the janitor a lot at the cheese fucking castle.  Yeah, he's probably bumping his broom into the cheese. 
[02:59:00]  He's always unclogging toilets.  All the guys constantly fucking plunging giant cheese shit.  The fucking richest guy in the neighborhood is the guy that owns the plunger stand across the street.  And nobody knew why he opened it, but when that castle got built, there's fucking Pete's Plungers standing out there with mittens in the winter.  How many, what are they called, Wisconsinites?  Yeah.  How many, is it really?  No.  Oh, I don't know.  How many people from Wisconsin have pink socks since we've discussed how much cheese they eat? 
[02:59:30]  Just fucking inverting their anus.  You think they're just fucking pink sock and left to right because they're trying to push cheese out?  I bet you people in Wisconsin, their shits are so long and thick that they actually have to stand up and they walk away from the toilet and they have to drag the shit out of the water and onto the floor like a tail while a loved one cuts it with scissors.  Have you ever had to cut one off?  No.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  They actually, I bet you they always have to go to work with a half a log.  Like they can never get rid of all of it because it's thick and laced with cheese. 
[03:00:00]  So their idea of like a clean asshole is to only have a quarter inch of shit sticking out of it as they prepare for work.  That's not very clean.  No, it's not.  No.  Every post on their Facebook page is getting attacked.  Well, do you guys want to learn about the story behind our cheese?  Yes.  And this guy, Matt, in all fairness.  Yep.  Just laying there.  He says, it's boring, but I'll tell you. 
[03:00:30]  So it's up to us.  Okay.  Yeah, let's hear it.  And then the screener says, oh, yeah, it's boring.  Let's hear it.  You want to go down this road?  We can always just punch out.  All right.  Let's get some knowledge today, guys.  Matt in Greenvale.  Yeah.  For a long time, let's have a first time bomber.  Wah, wah.  Just wanted to let you know that the cheese story, I swear to God, we had a drought years  ago back in the 1800s.  They farmed wheat up there.  And someone came around with cows and said, let's make some cheese out of it.  And now we make cheese, sausage, broth, and beer. 
[03:01:00]  And that's why we have the best toilets in the world, too.  It made Kohler.  Oh, wow.  That was quick.  That was pretty quick.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Keep fucking that chicken.  What kind of health issues can you have from eating too much cheese?  High cholesterol, fucking clogged arteries, heart attack, stroke, whatever would clog your  arteries.  That's the basic stuff.  But is there other shit?  Oh, you mean like short-term, like fucking upset tummy?  Diarrhea?  Farts?  Here's the disorder. 
[03:01:30]  Nothing worse than a cheese fart.  Dude, when I fucking eat cheese, my farts are like 300 degrees.  I get the fucking hot old cheese farts.  There's nothing worse than a fucking, a rotten hot cheese fart.  Why are some farts hotter than others?  I don't know.  Because my system is just, because my system doesn't even cool them.  It just gets it out.  It wants it out now.  Here's how it is with me when I eat cheese.  Out!  Their Twitter's getting killed too, by the way. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, that's so nice.  What's their Twitter?  Rick and Len.  Amanda?  Hi.  You're right.  Of course.  You're just right.  Hi, Amanda.  Amanda's just right.  Can we hang up?  Good morning.  No, don't hang up.  But you are right.  I noticed that recently too, and I'll stop.  Okay.  All right.  I just, I love you guys.  I listen to your show all the time.  I'm from Huntington, and I think it's great that you want to hide your great wealth and  dress down and be low-keyed, but then, perhaps, you should stop talking about your big 
[03:02:30]  Well, lately, I've been talking about it.  I don't know why.  Maybe some insecurities are coming into my soul.  But you're right, though.  I'm going to stop immediately because of your phone call.  No, I'm sure you won't, but I'm just sure.  No, I will.  I adjust all the time.  You're right.  Shut up, poor person!  That's Anthony.  And show a little class, and just not talk about all your money.  I just said you're right. 
[03:03:00]  Class schmats!  Only time will tell you.  Watch what I do now after your phone call.  I can't wait.  All right.  You're right, Amanda.  Go to FH Riley's, though.  Please.  I do.  I love it.  It's great.  Yeah, make them more money.  Ooh, what do you, what is your meal of choice at FH Riley's in the heart of Huntington  Village, 400 New York Avenue?  Go.  There's a few of them.  Click.  Anthony, cheese actually has traces of morphine in it. 
[03:03:30]  Not enough.  Oh, no.  State law that if you serve margarine, you have to serve butter.  Wouldn't it be the other way around if it's a law?  I think.  Never heard of that.  Well, they're trying to make it a little healthier, so if your restaurant serves butter, wouldn't  the state law mean you have to have a healthier alternative?  No, they just want to make sure that you're not actually making somebody healthy in Wisconsin.  Maybe Rick and Len will touch on this.  Yeah.  What's the average age of a male in Wisconsin?  Oh, my God. 
[03:04:00]  32?  Yeah.  Jesus.  They got a lot of lactate there.  They take in the lactate.  No, they probably banned it.  You want to learn about their stupid shoes?  I didn't even know Wisconsin had a stupid shoe thing.  What is it?  Like wooden shoes?  Let's find out.  Michelle?  Holland?  Michelle, let's go.  Hey.  Hi.  Stupid shoes.  That's what it says.  Stupid cheese.  Oh, stupid cheese. 
[03:04:30]  Who's screening this?  Who's screening you, Rick?  That would be Paul.  Whose mom is the baking champion.  That's true.  He's forgiven.  Yeah, well, unless he...  Can't yell at the guy whose mom is the baking champion.  Unless you want baked goods on one of the days that he doesn't work.  That's fine.  I don't care.  Whenever Paul's mom's ready to, like, you know,  give us more baked goods, we're good.  More goods.  She's the official baker of the Opie and Anthony show.  Your mom could have had that title, Sam.  Well, you guys like subpar baked goods.  That's cool. 
[03:05:00]  Michelle?  Yeah.  You're going to stand for that, Ann?  What, subpar baked goods?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  I'm saying subpar baked goods are the number one baked goods  when there's no other baked goods in here.  Thank you.  So you just admit, by the way,  that statement does admit that Paul's mom's baked goods  subpar.  I know you're good at wrestling angles and stuff,  but it's not going to work here when it comes to fucking goodness.  I'm not the one going for angles.  Sorry.  You're going for an angle.  You're the one saying baked goods champion.  She's the baking champion. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Which you and obviously your mom can't take.  Well, I know who's a better baker.  Well, we know too.  Paul's mom.  Michelle.  For your father.  For your father.  For your son.  For his foreskin.  Michelle, stupid cheese.  Go.  Don't eat the stupid fried mozzarella.  I did that and I had to lube my ass to take a shit.  Don't make that mistake.  Jesus.  What an enchantress. 
[03:06:00]  It was stuck and I couldn't get it out.  Enchantress.  Don't do that one.  My ribs hurt.  She has to lube her ass.  Why can't we have the classy ladies listening?  Nah.  Exactly.  She had to lube up her asshole to get the cheese shit out.  What'd you use?  Yeah.  What'd you use?  Oh, just the regular ass lube my husband fucked me with.  But this was way big.  That's great.  Motor oil.  Turkey.  It's probably turkey fat. 
[03:06:30]  Would you bring this one home to meet mom there, Jimmy?  Oh, fuck no.  She is a joy.  She really is.  She thinks she'd be a problem at Thanksgiving dinner.  She's blurred something stupid out.  The cheese is like 25 years old and then they want 100 bucks for it and then they want  you to eat it.  Through that crap.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Fuck me.  That's funny.  It's just the best word ever. 
[03:07:00]  All right, Michelle.  So they like their cheese.  They do.  They have 100 different varieties and they put everything in it.  They put cranberries in it, beer, wine, everything that they can think of.  They got pumpkin cheese for heaven's sake.  They got it all.  That sounds terrible.  By the way, Ant, because it's about cheese, obviously.  Sure.  Kurt Love says the mac and cheese at FH.  That's what's amazing.  Ah, look at that.  Nice plug.  Nice little plug.  He knew he'd get it in.  Thank you, sir.  All right, Michelle. 
[03:07:30]  Thank you.  This guy owns a bar and all they serve is cheese.  You want to talk to him?  I'd love to.  I can't get enough cheese.  Yeah.  The fucking, I bet you once a week, one of the chairs runs away.  They have to always go and corral the chairs because they make a break for all those fat  ass jeans, Wisconsin cheese farts.  What's worse than hearing about Packer babble while some drunk farts on you?  Those poor seats.  That's a cheese fart.  Oh, they'd fly notch at 200 miles an hour.  All they have to hear about is the running game and the defense. 
[03:08:00]  What?  What?  Fucking drinking awful old Milwaukee beer.  Rotten cheese farts.  Just hot.  Oh, how horrendous.  And Liam is very mad we haven't mentioned the sausage.  They like their sausage.  Yeah.  Sausage.  They don't have it.  Do they have a problem with Jimmy Dean's sausage?  So, Andy, cheese bar guy, go.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  I own a bar here in Janesville, Wisconsin.  That's all we have here is cheese. 
[03:08:30]  Cheese with pretzels, pretzels and cheese.  We got cheese bread, cheese pizza.  I love cheese bread, by the way.  Yeah?  My grandmother used to make it or get it from the store.  Oh, my God.  The cheese bread she used to make.  No, she would just buy a cheese bread.  It was a special treat.  With all that cheese, their pizza must be amazing in Wisconsin.  Oh, it's great, actually.  It comes from a little town about 20 miles away.  Actually, I went to bar right on the gates of where a General Motors plant was about three  years ago.  Fascinating. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, wait.  So I was trying to tell a moving story.  My grandmother would bring home a cheese bread, and I would smell it being toasted, and she  would say, is that cheese bread?  And she would say, yes, and she'd be jerking me off on the couch.  That's what she would do while it was heating up, right?  Sweet memory.  Right.  What a sweet memory.  Yeah.  I would pretend I wasn't feeling it, but I kept hearing the ching-a-ling-a-ling of the  charm bracelet.  Representing each grandkid.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  With five faces frowning. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, fuck.  What?  Sorry, buddy.  Hey, but anyways, this factory, there was a GM plant there, right?  And all we did was sell cheese curds at lunchtime when they came over.  That's all we had to serve was cheese curds.  Jesus.  And they ate the shit out of them.  And they were made locally, too.  Oh, imagine that.  Then back on the assembly line, just farting on a nice, hot, fucking GM assembly line.  Someone's working on the interior, putting seats in.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:10:00]  Testing them out.  None of them had the new car smell.  They just all smell like farts.  I don't know if Jimmy wants to play today, but I'll give it a try.  Do you think they, I don't know, like their cheese in Wisconsin, Jimmy?  They like their cheese so much, they should vary it.  That's a good one.  That was a softball up.  Steve in Chicago.  Hey, guys.  Good morning, Facts.  How are you?  All right. 
[03:10:30]  They love it!  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  It's one of those SNL things, you know.  They love catchphrases out there.  Go ahead, Steve.  A couple of years ago, my ex-girlfriend moved outside of fucking Madison, and I was going  to go to a Green Bay game, and I went up to visit her on my way there.  She gained like 100 fucking pounds, and they do ranch dressing shots when they do their  fucking tailgating.  Instead of doing shots of licking, they drink ranch fucking dressing.  Why?  That's just people being wacky. 
[03:11:00]  It has to be.  Was that a fart, or him blowing his wine?  I know.  Sounded like a cheese fart.  That could be a new game.  So she got all fat.  Fart or horn?  Chicks like eating that cheese, getting a little weight.  Yeah, keep eating that cheese.  You want to hear the song parody, They Teased?  I didn't forget.  Yes, oh, that's right.  Rick and Len on WAPL in Wisconsin.  Since October, they teased a song parody before break.  I judge all song parodies on length. 
[03:11:30]  Shoehorning?  Length.  It's the most important thing to any song parody.  Oh, no, is it not?  I would quick.  Well, how long do you think a radio song parody should be for the air?  Tops a minute 15.  A minute, yeah.  Okay.  Tops.  Well, I actually put in bold on the track listing that I gave you the length of this track,  and I want you to know that the entire time listed there is the track.  Ant, you're going to be begging for the shepherd of leaves. 
[03:12:00]  Really?  Is it that bad?  It's three minutes and 49 seconds.  It's a four-minute song parody, yes.  It's an epic.  About a cheese billboard.  About a cheese billboard.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  How much can you say about a cheese billboard?  I thought we wasted time in our show.  Damn.  Oh, no.  So, with the help of Mark Goldie of Rock Garden Studios, here you go.  Your musical response to the cheese billboard on 105.7 WAPL.  It's the Rick and Len Show. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  The rocket.  Oh, no.  Signs.  Billboard.  I get it.  Yep.  And the sign says we're all going to die from eating cheese.  They put it up near Lambeau Field.  Won't you take it down now, please?  A group of the physicians come in deep.  Oh.  Was that shoehorning?  Oh, that was a real shoehorn.  Was that shoehorning?  Slight.  Yeah, that was a real shoehorn.  Ant brought up the shoehorning for everybody.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:13:00]  That was a shoehorn?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to fit the words in like they're supposed to fit in.  That kind of makes a good song parody, you know?  Well.  Oh, and his vocals are terrible.  Yeah.  Get someone that could sing.  Yeah, an extra syllable or two that he needed to fit into that part of the song.  He's wavering on the key.  You hear him like, oh, he's flat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's terrible.  Dear Lambeau Field, won't you take it down now, please?  A group of the physicians come in deep for responsible medicine. 
[03:13:30]  Responsible.  Wands that cheese can sack your health.  Huh, I don't think it can.  Sack, sack, everywhere inside.  He's blocking up my arteries.  Wait.  It can't be arteries.  Arteries.  Now I get it.  The sign doesn't block up your arteries.  No, it's arteries.  Arteries.  Arteries.  Arteries.  Responsibility.  Yeah.  It's like you can't put the accent on the wrong syllable.  Right. 
[03:14:00]  You're right.  Yes.  That's really bad.  And why is he now saying blocking up your arteries?  That's what I guess the sign says.  Cheese blocks up your arteries.  Oh, the billboard is anti-cheese.  I thought he was getting anti-cheese.  They want to keep the people healthy.  But that's all they have up there.  Let them eat their cheese.  Yeah.  I just want to point out, only one minute has gone by so far. 
[03:14:30]  They did the entire song, is what they did.  Yeah.  That would have been good enough.  That would have been like sweeper time.  That's the only station in the world.  It's amazing.  Fucking A.  Check it out.  Right.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go anywhere.  You know how many tweets I got over the weekend from people that said that I got this 
[03:15:00]  song stuck in their head all weekend because it was on the worst song.  How fucking awful is this?  Who these bitches?  I love when Jimmy does that, but you can't see behind you right now.  Who these bitches?  Who these that bitch?  Who these that bitch?  Making Jimmy do all his catchphrases today.  I'm sorry.  I don't know who that bitch is. 
[03:15:30]  There was a lot of them, though, Jimmy.  I kill her.  There was a lot of bitches gaggle.  I kill that motherfucker.  I smacked my pussy in my fist.  Yeah, what happened?  We're getting to phase three on their Rick and Len Show Facebook page.  What did they do?  Their last post that they did had well over 300 comments.  Yeah.  And so they've now deleted their last post.  Oh, boy.  Which is a feeble attempt because now everybody's just going to attack whatever the top post is.  Yeah.  They're fighting.  I give this Rick and Len a lot of props today. 
[03:16:00]  A lot of props today.  They're hanging in there.  Nobody's made it to phase three.  They're hanging in there without canceling their Facebook.  A complete shutdown.  Yeah.  And that's where they're hanging in there.  They're hanging in there.  They're hanging in there.  The pest will work around this, though.  I know they will.  Right.  Oh, another one.  Yes.  Deleted.  Another post.  Deleted.  Okay.  And these are their own posts.  These are their own posts.  They're deleting.  But they've had to sacrifice them to get rid of all the comments.  It's just making the pests hungrier, for instance, Helen Bergeron, who just wrote, Helen Bergeron signing off. 
[03:16:30]  I don't even remember what she sounded like.  You know, Brian in Philly says they didn't even have to shoehorn that.  I heard that, too.  Yeah, yeah.  If you know the song, they didn't have to shoehorn that.  But I think they're so used to adding syllables that it just felt right.  Let's hear the rest.  And the sign says cheese has a whole lot of fat and gobs of cholesterol. 
[03:17:00]  It's loaded with a bunch of sodium.  Well, I say, is that all?  Because we eat brats and we drink beer and we know that we're not getting thinner.  But if God will hear you, tell it to your face.  Cheese, it's what's for dinner.  Oh, boy.  Blocking up my arteries.  It's arteries.  You can do it there.  I don't need that.  Fuck. 
[03:17:30]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Now, hey, Grim Reaper, listen here.  You and your PCRM freaks.  You can't tell Packer fans what to eat.  You ain't supposed to eat.  And then they just throw in a part of the chorus that just is in the real song.  Well, I just want to stop to let you know that we're halfway through the song.  Oh, great.  Half.  Halfway through.  This is on terrestrial radio, too. 
[03:18:00]  Half.  We're halfway through.  Jeff himself, that's very good.  He goes, damn, that's a good song parody.  I've been eating cheese all my life.  Look at me.  I'm doing fine.  Huh.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  You don't like that? 
[03:18:30]  It sounded nothing like the song.  You know what?  I closed my eyes, and all I saw was you and your brother, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Musical chemistry, man.  Oh, I hear you.  Advice coming in on Facebook.  Don't fight it, shit dicks.  Right there.  Don't fight it.  Yeah, because they don't know.  Like, we leave in a few minutes.  This will continue.  Because there are new people here in the afternoon.  Yeah, they'll get all pumped up.  This will just continue for days.  They're all going to want me to talk about it on the after show, so they're going to go crazy with it.  Oh, yeah.  And I will talk about it.  If you guys are doing your part, I'll do mine. 
[03:19:00]  And please talk about the current baking champion, please.  I'll bring it up.  It's your duty.  It really is your duty.  Can I hear that one part again?  Really?  I didn't get douched out enough when he goes into the little talking part they do.  That means we're going all the way back to only the song halfway over, though.  Oh, that's okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  I've been eating cheese all my life.  Look at me.  I'm doing fine. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Look at me.  I'm doing fine.  Look, we see your picture.  You're not.  Yeah.  Damn cheese is blocking the hair follicle.  Yeah.  And they leave the whole lead in.  Of course they do.  They got it.  All of you people.  All of you people.  All of you people. 
[03:20:00]  They finish.  Now our signs say that everybody's welcome to the town where the green and gold play.  But when you come in here and cut our cheese, we're going to have something to say.  We love our cheese with extra cheese, no matter your little sign.  So you can take your billboard and put it well.  You know the sun don't shine.  Oh, man. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, my God.  Cheese.  We get it.  Nothing about the cheese.  Stupid cheese sign.  Stupid cheese sign.  Oh, yeah.  Stupid cheese sign.  Oh, side, side.  Stupid cheese sign.  Oh, things go better with cheddar. 
[03:21:00]  Once you've had Colby Jack, you'll never go back.  My cholesterol's about 410.  And climbing.  I'm proud to eat me some American.  Slice me out some of that Wisconsin cheese.  I love it.  We can win in the morning.  You're key stringling in. 
[03:21:30]  November 3, 4, and 5, Stress Factory, New Brunswick.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5. 
[03:22:00]  Ha, ha.  Cheese.  Cheese.  November 11 and 12.  Oh, he's gone.  Brokerage Comedy Club, Belmore, Long Island.  November 18 and 19, Harrisburg at the Comedy Zone.  November 25, 26, Poconuts in the Poconaut Brewing Company.  Cheese.  And Jim's, let me.  Well, I mean, their Facebook is still active. 
[03:22:30]  You know, I get, you rock, why don't you just hit the sweeper?  You sure?  Yeah.  Okay.  Series XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, indeed.  Another day, another Jocktober.  That one actually chased Opie and Anthony out of the room.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:23:00]  I'm Sam Roberts.  Mars was just in here.  Our engineer, Mars, getting tape or something.  A lot of people really enjoyed the Mars bit over the weekend on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  By the way, After Opie and Anthony Live is brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan is, of course, as you know, America's number one most trusted condom company.  Get out.  That's right.  Number one, Eric, there is no more trusted condom company in these United States than Trojan, and for good reason. 
[03:23:30]  But, yeah, I got a lot of messages from people saying they really enjoyed Mars' inability to translate.  Because forever, our engineer, Mars, we learned this on Friday on the air, forever he would come in here and not be able to pronounce things in English.  The fast food chicken restaurant was, of course, Chickafilla.  Chickafilla.  His favorite show on FX was The Sons of Arneki. 
[03:24:00]  So everybody took for granted, and maybe it was a little racist on the part of everybody, but everybody took for granted that there was a language barrier.  And I think maybe, Mars, you're walking in here.  Obviously, you heard what I was saying.  Maybe it was a little racist for people to assume that the reason that you couldn't pronounce these English words was a language barrier.  And obviously, they only guessed that because of the color of your skin.  That's why the color of my skin?  I mean, you know, because of your heritage. 
[03:24:30]  Okay.  Like, I would assume that that's why people thought you couldn't, like, you mispronounced English words, and people thought the reason for that was a language barrier.  Right.  When you don't even speak the other language.  Oh, actually, I do.  It's actually interpreting the other language at a higher level, you know, newscast.  A higher level.  Yeah.  Maybe speak, like, you know, mano a mano, man to man, you know.  Mano y mano.  That's Spanish.  Ask for a beer, you know, get myself out of trouble. 
[03:25:00]  Maybe.  Maybe.  Yeah.  But not legal jargon or just.  Legal jargon.  Maybe things are done differently in, like, Chile and Mexico and Puerto Rico.  But in America, I wouldn't consider American news to be the upper echelon of communication.  That this is really complicated dialect on the news.  They use big words.  You find that.  They use big words.  They're complicated for you.  Now, since people realized, listening on Friday and over the weekend, and I got a lot of people, 
[03:25:30]  you got, we have to give full credit to Danny for the introduction of, damn, that's a good fill in the blank here that came up during your fight.  Because that's what you said when you were showing him Apple TV.  You, this whole altercation between you and Danny claims to have started, and I don't believe it for a second, but claims to have started with you insisting that the Apple TV feed that we have in the studio is an HD feed.  And Danny's saying, that's not HD, and you, setting the feed up there, going, damn, that's a good picture. 
[03:26:00]  And Danny's impression of you was so to die for that it's become a show thing now.  You have your own little catchphrase on the show.  And people were tweeting me all weekend, listening to the countdown.  Damn, that's a good blank.  Or, you know, they were at home doing the Mars impression.  Is it exciting for you that people are at home with their wives and their children doing this Mars impression?  This is you, and they're doing an impression of you. 
[03:26:30]  Like, now when fans see you on the street, if they recognize you, they could go, damn, that's a good, and then whatever.  Like, if you're getting into your car, damn, Mars, that's a nice car.  Is this exciting?  You have your own catchphrase.  I don't know.  I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.  I mean, it is, at its root, mocking you mercilessly.  Right.  So, in that context, bad thing, but...  For the show, it's great.  For the show, it's great, and for the attention of you.  How do you explain the fact that you can't speak English or Spanish? 
[03:27:00]  Actually, I couldn't speak Spanish.  Couldn't.  Not as well...  I couldn't speak Spanish.  Not as well.  Actually, I couldn't speak Spanish.  Not as well as...  You know, the shame of it all is that nowadays, I can't talk to my mom as much as I would like, because the Spanish is so horrible.  It's getting worse.  Your mom tries to talk to you.  Oh, poor lady.  You're like, look, look, mom, I love you very much.  I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about right now. 
[03:27:30]  It sounds like, I don't know, maybe you're getting to a certain age, or I'm just a stupid person.  But I don't know the words that you're telling me right now.  I don't know what they mean.  It's constant correcting me on pronunciation of certain words and stuff, and I get caught up in trying to figure out what the hell I'm trying to say.  So then why can't you speak English?  I can speak English.  All right, so what's the...  Can you say the show that you watch now on FX?  You've practiced it so many times.  Sons of Arnicky.  You can't speak English. 
[03:28:00]  You just said it wrong.  Did I?  Sons of Arnicky.  Okay.  Okay.  You said it wrong again.  How about you prove you can speak English.  What is the chicken restaurant I referenced when you were walking in here?  I thought it was Chickafill.  Chickafill.  What's the thing you have, the condition you have when you read backwards?  Dyslexia.  Yeah.  Have you been tested for that? 
[03:28:30]  Yes.  And what are the results?  I'm good to go, man.  Oh, I figured, yes, you are dyslexic.  Well, then again, that was years ago when I was a kid.  God knows.  So you may have developed adult dyslexia.  Yes.  Is that a condition?  Yes, it is.  Adult dyslexia?  Yeah, absolutely.  Mars definitely has it.  Or he's just, like, very stupid.  Eric, what was it to you?  By the way, I love doing Mars segments because without fail, anytime, like on Friday or now  with this, because Mars keeps the channel obviously on in the engineer room. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  All the engineers share a room here at Sirius.  So, like, random engineers that work for different channels and for all over, all day they're  going to be coming up to me.  Loved your stuff on the after show today.  Loved your stuff.  Oh, really?  All the Mars stuff.  Yeah, I get it all the time from the engineers.  They love it.  It was good stuff, man.  They love it.  Eric, what was the other one you were...  What was that country in Central America next to Honduras?  It starts with an N.  That's because I say it in Spanish.  Nicaragua.  Yeah, okay.  That's gotten better. 
[03:29:30]  Right, because you pronounce...  You don't pronounce the strong G because it's the Spanish pronunciation.  Yeah, that works.  What doesn't work is...  Yeah, Tuesday nights, 10 p.m. on FX is Sons of Anarchy.  You got it!  Mars, you did it!  Are your engineer people calling you?  Do you need to do something with them?  No, no, not at all.  They're actually telling me to...  What?  One guy.  He's kind of silly. 
[03:30:00]  Telling you to what?  Fuck Sam up.  Fuck me up.  For what?  That's why I didn't want to repeat it.  I'm just asking you, you know...  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  How has life changed?  They don't understand the relationship we've got here.  I see.  And that's like when you first started.  You didn't get it either.  I'm sorry?  People in the corner looking for you.  Okay, thanks.  I'll be right there.  He doesn't believe...  You don't believe it, do you?  Roland's a liar.  Roland, did you like, for once, somebody...  Because for years, it's been your...  Making fun of the way you speak. 
[03:30:30]  Making fun...  Was it nice to see Mars get thrown out of the bus for those reasons?  Mars cannot speak worth...  You know what, man?  I was looking for you for help, and you didn't come in here rushing to help a guy out.  Because I speak properly.  Oh, do you really?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Si, senor.  Hey, hombre.  You hear those R's, Ro?  I did.  All right.  I would like to see Roland's interpretation of Spanish.  Well, I don't know if we want to go through that.  No, not now, but sometime in the future.  Can you speak Spanish?  What happened?  Si, senor, Sam.  I can.  Did you just reload the Facebook page? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Okay, do a search on Facebook for, uh, Len, Rick and Len.  Okay, this could be big news.  One, uh, two, uh, three words.  All separate words.  Yeah.  Uh, this could be big, folks.  Well, um, Paul's struggling because, like, his mom's key lime pie struggles in flavor.  Uh, mom's key lime pie is delicious.  Ladies and gentlemen, it would appear that after earlier in the day taking down the entire 
[03:31:30]  WAPL station page that finally at, call it, 10, 15 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, of course,  the Rick and Len show Facebook page has been taken down.  It's off of Facebook.  You did it again.  You did it again out there.  Uh, I don't know why we even question you.  Uh, as a matter of fact, we'll go, Pete in, in Fairfax, both Facebook pages have been  shut down?  Yes, it has.  I typed in, uh, Rick and Len and WAPL, and it went back to, uh, my Facebook page. 
[03:32:00]  So, there's nowhere on Facebook.  Nowhere.  Rick and Len or WAPL.  So, well done, other four listeners of the show.  Were you one of the five?  Uh, I guess I was.  I wasn't typing anything, but I was, uh, just observing what the, uh, wonderful ONA listeners  have, uh, have said with, uh, about Rick and Len.  What was your favorite?  What was some of your favorites?  Uh, just the word AIDS over and over and over again.  Uh, Len or Rick shoves their shit dick in the other guy's ass. 
[03:32:30]  Well, I mean, there's just so much to do and so much celebrating to do.  Well, you guys, uh, you, all, all you listeners can celebrate together.  Thank you, Pete.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  Thanks, buddy.  I mean, it's amazing the power that these listeners have.  And you know what it is, too?  Because back in the day, like in the KROQ days, uh, we would, the pests, quote unquote, like,  we haven't even been calling them pests lately.  But the pests would go out on missions constantly, whether it was a certain news show or, or, or, or, or anything. 
[03:33:00]  We'd send the pests out to do this, send the pests out to do that.  If a caller called up, send the, we don't do it anymore.  So now it's like, they've been sitting kind of dormant.  They've been hibernating for so long that when we finally brought them out for this Jocktober, my God, do you, are you still out there?  Because they have attacked, like no army has attacked it.  It's, it's really amazing.  Um, Mars, people are actually, uh, requesting that you set up a Twitter account.  Would you ever consider, uh, venturing into the, it's right here on, you know, I'm not. 
[03:33:30]  I hear you.  Okay.  Would you think about venturing into the world of social media?  Yes, I will think about it.  But you won't do it.  I don't know about that.  Why don't you just like pose little thoughts for Mars?  Hey, have you ever noticed?  And then we don't make fun of your misspellings and, you know, your dumb observations.  Uh, I don't know.  I mean, look, Mars, here's your problem.  You're becoming a star in front of our eyes.  This is a problem.  What's like, you have to grow with the star so it doesn't flame out. 
[03:34:00]  And one of those things is maybe.  Twitter?  Tweet.  Twitter?  One of those things is Twitter.  Roland's on Twitter.  And, you know, because the fans had a demand for Roland on Twitter.  He's on there.  Uh, you know, obviously me and Eric and all the guys, we're all on Twitter.  Mars, maybe it's time.  What was your, as you said so elegantly or eloquently both, what would your Twitter name be?  P.R. Mars. 
[03:34:30]  I would have to think about it.  I don't know.  Uncreative racism.  What would you lean towards?  Something like, something jujitsu related?  Like BJJ Mars?  No, not at all.  Or just Mars gives BJs or something?  Mars gives BJs?  I don't know what it would be.  That's news to me.  I don't know.  Since when do I do that?  I don't know what it would be.  It's rumors.  It's just rumors.  It's rumors.  The engineering department tells me all kinds of weird stuff.  The other Poe.  The other Poe?  No, that's an insult.  No, he's being offensive.  He's being, to you.  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  You take offense to that.  The other Poe.  Yeah.  The other Poe.  He's in Florida.  Is he?  I have no idea.  He's probably molesting people right now.  But, uh, I mean, that's, I guess Roland has more information than the rest of us, but  he is on top of things.  He's in Oklahoma now.  He's in Oklahoma now.  Oh, is he for real?  I don't know.  Roland just makes shit up.  But it really is amazing, uh, what's happened with Jocktober.  Uh, Rick and Len went down today.  And I, I think, I can't imagine Rick and Len just sitting there doing their show.  And I mean, the thing about it is, I listen to these shows, and Rick and Len don't do anything. 
[03:35:30]  They don't.  You had a dick in the ass this morning.  They woke up.  Yeah.  They were doing a great show on Monday.  They don't make an effort.  They don't, you can tell in their show that they don't go home and think, what can I do  to make the show better tomorrow?  They don't think, oh, what can I, oh, this would be good for the show.  This, they don't even read a news article and think, what's the angle to take on this?  Nothing.  They just read the news.  Hey, here's a wacky story. 
[03:36:00]  And then they read the wacky story.  And then one of them, whichever one does the, did the Greyhound story, comes up with something  is so stupid that you have to hit a sweeper because there's no way anybody would laugh at it.  Did you know you can, uh, leave comments for Rick and Len on their live blog?  No, on their live blog.  Live blog.  I just tried to see if it would work and, you know, commented on the story that they  have.  W-A-P-L dot com?  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  It is going to be a long day for them.  And that's what all the, all you Jocktober fans always say. 
[03:36:30]  Watch out because it's going to be a long day.  I mean, usually, and, and actually, Paul, first of all, sign out on my Facebook before  something dangerous happens.  Absolutely.  Um, and also see on that computer, just like Google news, Opie and Anthony or Jocktober  or something, and see if you can find that article that came out at the end of last week  about Jocktober.  Because, uh, Rick and Alana, I think it was, I don't, do you, Eric, do you remember what  city Rick and Alana were in?  Uh, Rick and Alana.  No.  No.  I think, were they the one in St. Cloud, Minnesota?  They were in Minnesota, I think. 
[03:37:00]  Could be, couldn't be, but probably St. Cloud, Minnesota.  Uh, Detroit was Blaine and Allison, but yeah, Rick and Alana were in, uh, no, Idaho, because  it was from the Idaho press.  Yeah, they were from Idaho and they came up with this article that was in the local newspaper  about how hard it was for Rick and Alana to get through this Jocktober attack.  Uh, and I remember specifically, the reason I bring this up is because they talked about  that we mercilessly, uh, attacked them for an hour. 
[03:37:30]  However, we went after Rick and Alana for two hours today.  I mean, we spent two hours on that show today and, and it was just relentless, but, all right,  so it's at the Idaho Statesman.com.  What's that?  Michael Deeds?  Is that his name?  Yep.  Read this article and tell me that Michael Deeds is not an Opie and Anthony fan.  Like, he knows way too many details about it.  He's using words like, like Anthony commented on the words he was using in the article, like  eviscerated, and, and what are some of the other words that he uses in there? 
[03:38:00]  Um, he uses wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's the name of the country, station.  He uses periods too.  When he described the, um, the pointless morning show fake laugh, it sounded just like a description  that came from the show.  Right?  Like, they call themselves pests.  He knows about that.  Oh, yeah.  Um, he uses eviscerated, which Anthony said, this is not a word that comes up in news articles  very often, but let me tell you something.  Jim, Anthony, those guys use the word eviscerated all the time. 
[03:38:30]  Um, radio guffaw.  These are, a lot of these keywords and a lot of the details that he knows.  Like the C word?  Yeah, the C word.  There's no way that this guy, Michael Deeds, who wrote this article in the Idaho Statesman,  is not an Opie and Anthony fan.  I mean, he probably knew writing this that it was only going to make it worse for them.  Man, he's probably, he's probably leaving comments on their Facebook page.  He was probably the one who was leaving that one with the, with the shit and the hand masturbating 
[03:39:00]  the penis with the shit all over it.  Wait, the author of this article?  I think so.  Okay.  I'm predicting, and I don't know this for a fact, but my prediction here is the guy  who kept going to Facebook pages and leaving the, the picture of the hand on the erect  penis with the jizz and the shit around the hand and the penis was indeed Michael Deeds.  I believe it was.  I mean, I don't, you know, I don't know how I can prove it, but I believe Michael Deeds  was the guy.  Uh, Scott in Syracuse, you wanted to ask something. 
[03:39:30]  Hey, I wanted to know if, uh, there's any way you'd show, uh, ONA, one of their old shows  in Jacktober.  Listen, uh, Scott, it's, it's a great question because traditionally, uh, I don't think it's  happened every year, but some years it has, and I, I, my plan is for Jacktober 31st to  feature the Opie and Anthony show.  Now, Ant says that he has this tape in his house, uh, uh, a tape, it's a CD, but you know,  we call it a tape because we're used to saying that this tape in his house of Opie and Anthony 
[03:40:00]  from back in the day doing this long form bit of, you know, you were a child of the eighties  because if it might actually be a tape, it could be a tape, I guess I may have to convert  it, but I have to, I'm going to get that tape.  I mean, Kenny's going to be calling him, trying to tell him to bring it in.  If I have to drive to Long Island myself and show up at the compound, I may get shot, but  I will try.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess I can't make any demands.  I'll probably ring the bell and then politely ask if I could please have the CD. 
[03:40:30]  That's about as much as I could do.  You have to do that Jocktober early because Jimmy's guest is coming that day.  Well, we'll do, I mean, I don't control when Jocktober happens.  I mean, you have to do it early.  Who's, who's coming in on Jocktober 31st?  Tonya Omi.  Whoa, a member of Black Sabbath comes in here.  I'm pretty sure that I won't have to enforce that anything gets done at a certain time.  When a member of Black Sabbath is in here, I'm pretty sure Jim will take the reins on the  show without a problem.  What time is he coming in on Jocktober 31st? 
[03:41:00]  Uh, 9.30.  Oh, so, I mean, we're not going to do it at 9.30.  Um, and what about Roland?  Speaking of guests.  And yeah, so if you're, if you're looking up this article, read the article again and  read it in the context of this guy's definitely an Opie and Anthony fan because he is.  And on that level, even though the article is about the show making these DJs cry and  what terrible people we are and even going so far, so far as to call us cyber bullies 
[03:41:30]  of all the things, uh, he's obviously a fan and, and he knew that writing this article  would end up on the air.  He probably just wanted his name right on the air.  Unfortunately for him, uh, the comments on the article, I was reading them over the weekend  have not been kind.  Uh, he may have closed them.  Um, or deleted them.  Oh, is that them?  No.  No.  Looks like he deleted.  Oh, no, no, no.  There they are.  Okay.  There's plenty of them.  So he probably should have closed comments off on that article.  But Roland, we were just talking about guests that are coming in. 
[03:42:00]  Can we talk about, do we have a guest coming in tomorrow that we can talk about?  Yeah, Brett Ratner.  Brett Ratner is coming in tomorrow.  Well, that's a pretty big one.  And he's in, he's, he directed Tower Heist and he's producing the Oscars this year.  Yep.  Correct?  Correct.  And we do.  Wasn't there another guest coming in tomorrow?  Tomorrow?  No.  Jim Florentine.  This week though?  Yeah.  A big one.  Yeah.  Are we mentioning that or no?  Not yet, just in case.  Okay. 
[03:42:30]  Well, keep in mind, Brett Ratner, look, Brett Ratner is a huge guest.  Brett Ratner is A-list.  I mean.  Yeah, well, his movie made billions of dollars.  He's directing Tower Heist.  It's like, regardless of what you think it looks like, Tower Heist got.  Eddie Murphy was hilarious.  Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, Ferris Bueller, all of them.  I saw Saturday morning.  Precious.  And you liked it?  Alan Alda.  Yeah.  Alan Alda.  Precious just has a bad Jamaican accent though.  You don't like her accent?  No, but Eddie Murphy was hilarious.  Was he?  Yeah, he's really, really. 
[03:43:00]  He's trying to mount a comeback now, right?  He's doing a good job in this one.  Oh.  Alan Alda was good.  He played like a Bernie Madoff-ish type.  Oh, right, because that's the theme of the whole thing.  Well, hopefully it works out.  But what I was saying was, Brett Ratner's coming in here.  And Brett Ratner is a major guest.  Like, most weeks, if Brett Ratner's coming in, this is the guest of the week because he's A-list.  Even with Brett Ratner being here tomorrow, there is a major star probably coming in this week. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, he is coming in.  He is, but you just don't want to announce because, okay.  He is.  You heard it from the man himself.  You heard it from Roland.  It wasn't that easy to understand, but you heard it from him.  He said, he is.  It's locked.  And this guest will, I think, surprise a lot of people that he came in.  Can we, any hints?  Can I say whether or not he's been on the show before, whether or not he's called in before?  Can I say that?  Yeah.  He has called in before.  Yeah.  Yes.  Multiple times.  Multiple times. 
[03:44:00]  This guest has called in.  Never been in.  Never been in studio.  So all you Edward Norton conspiracy theorists, sorry he's been in here.  Has he?  Oh, yeah.  He was in here once.  Once.  Maybe he'll be in a second time sometime.  Yeah, he will be.  Yeah.  December, I think.  He's a fan of the show.  He doesn't like doing press, but he likes doing our show.  Same thing with Dana White.  Dana White loves this show for some reason.  It's just, it's an easy hang, and hopefully, mystery guest number nine.  It's the elevator.  So if the guys want to announce it, they could announce it. 
[03:44:30]  Gotcha.  Okay.  Because that's a, yeah.  Gotcha.  Okay.  Well, that could be a big one, and I, for one, am excited about it.  Actually, I wanted to play.  Eric, do we have a little snippet of that bit I was talking to you about?  Oh, yeah.  It's about six minutes.  Okay, good.  And maybe Travis could talk about it a little bit,  because, or maybe he doesn't want to talk about it.  I don't know.  But earlier on in the show, in the first hour,  before we spent the last 120 minutes of this show destroying Rick and Len. 
[03:45:00]  That's their names, right?  This is, this is how little these jock-to...  I go through a show a day for jock-tober,  and, like, everybody, for the victim of jock-tober,  it's their whole world.  For me, it happened 30 minutes ago, and I don't remember the name.  I have to keep looking down at the paper.  You keep forgetting after you just said it.  I just said it, and that's because I'm already trying to think of what show's going to be tomorrow.  I have to keep this ball rolling.  It's got momentum.  And I was talking about it last week.  I feel confident now that it's going to keep going. 
[03:45:30]  But, anyway, before we did all that jock-tober,  we were talking about the saga of Travis's mom.  I know a lot of you weren't on board,  so I wanted to bring you up to date.  I'm going to bring them up to date on the saga of your mom that we talked about earlier today  when you first told the story on the air.  But we're just going to make a six-minute version,  because what happened was...  It went on for a while.  Travis told the story, and then...  Is this the first time I told the story?  It is, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then it went on for the next 40 minutes of them just mercilessly mocking you. 
[03:46:00]  So we'll play a little bit of this,  and then we'll come back and talk about it a little bit,  as long as Mr. Travis is okay.  We don't want to cross any.  Mr. Travis.  Mr. Travis.  Poe will never stop being referenced.  How long does this guy...  Everybody who's been gone for that long,  we've totally forgotten they existed.  You know?  And, I mean, Steve C. is almost to the point where he'll never be mentioned again.  I doubt that.  You think so?  Yeah.  Poe and Steve C. are in that infamous corner. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, like, there's plenty of people who I don't even remember.  Right.  For instance...  Fee-fi-fo-fo-poe.  For instance, intern Paul.  Who?  Who?  Oh!  I'm in the room, guys.  Totally forgot.  And maybe we'll talk about the baking goods, too.  After this, this is Travis's mom's story,  so everybody can be brought on board here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Travis, mommy issue?  So what's the mommy issue?  She left seven years ago. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, boy.  I haven't spoken to her since.  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  Why'd she leave?  In my opinion, I think she just had, like, a midlife.  She had a homosexual son.  She saw the cat picture.  Don't talk about my brother.  Wait, how old, Travis, are you now?  I'm 27.  So she was 20.  You were a grown man.  Do you have any younger siblings?  Yeah.  How old?  He's a year younger than me.  Okay, so you're both grown up.  And you haven't talked to your own mom in seven years?  No.  Why?  Do you know where she is?  No.  You don't even know where she is?  No. 
[03:47:30]  Why'd she leave?  It can't be just a midlife crisis.  She never wanted you in the first place.  Oh, Jesus.  Has she tried to contact you?  Oh, no.  I was, when she left originally, I was the one keeping contact with her.  Oh, okay.  So she left, and then you were still kind of keeping contact.  But she cut off contact with everyone.  Oh, okay.  Like, me, my brother, her brother.  Wow.  Everyone.  Did she start up a new family?  Yeah.  Well, what happened was she married a Jewish guy. 
[03:48:00]  The Jew?  Who I think his, like, level of faith is to cut off your previous life.  Make my day, Jew.  When you convert.  Did she convert?  Yeah.  And when you convert, I think you cut off that part of your life.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Fuck it.  Whoa.  That is something.  I haven't spoken to her in seven years.  That doesn't sound very Christian.  Oh.  It isn't.  He obviously has a huge cock.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:48:30]  Jesus.  He's fucking, oh.  Yeah, that's what Jewish guys are known for.  I know.  That's what makes it even more amazing.  He's knocking that fucking goyim pussy into the fucking mess with.  They're all high-fiving him behind his scenes.  Oh, yeah.  This guy must be a stud in bed that she's given up everything for.  She fucking, she pretty much.  She loves the cock, Travis.  I guess so.  She changed gods.  Yeah.  She changed gods.  Denounced Christ.  Denounced Christ.  Got rid of her previous family all for the cock. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, renounced.  Yeah.  What is that?  Renounced, denounced.  Never looked at it that way.  She fucking gave up.  I feel like denounced.  How about pronounce?  Yeah.  How about pounce?  Like she did on that fucking Jewish fucking clipped piece of meat.  That fucking, I bet his cock is so fat it has a yarmulke.  Fucking sweaty cock head he has.  A little yarmulke.  His pubes are curled like payas around his balls.  That's right.  He fucking puts a little briefcase with money.  He fucking handcuffs it to his cock shaft. 
[03:49:30]  He's fucking, I don't mean to be disrespectful to your mother.  For seven years, she has been taking fucking kosher seed on the fucking, on the face and  in the hair.  Sorry, man.  I became a little child.  So I said, oh, it's his mom.  Oh, he hasn't seen her in seven years.  You know what it is?  He's only fucking religious women for.  So when he got, he got a hold of her and the way she, like, he never had a finger in  his asshole before.  But fucking boy, when, when that fucking, when that, when that fucking Christian hand  reached around. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  He's like, why are you putting your finger in your mouth?  And she went, hold on a second.  Keep your hat on and I'll show you.  She's wetting her finger.  She's the first one to ever pull the sheet down and expose her big tits.  They want you to come on these, Morris.  Oh my God.  Morris.  Oh.  He's never had that before. 
[03:50:30]  Ever.  Well, let's ask Travis.  Travis, does your mom have big tits?  No.  Oh, damn.  I'll bet if she got implants, I'll bet you Morris likes big tits and she had them blown  up.  Fuck.  She's like fucking Colonel Kurtz.  Yeah.  Fuck the kids.  Fuck that cat.  My faggot son.  I got Jew dick.  Anything for you, Morris.  Whatever you want, Morris.  Jew dick.  Sell the husband.  Sell the kids.  I'm never coming back.  Are you a rabbi, Willard? 
[03:51:00]  I'm a cuckoo.  She likes that, huh?  Wow.  Yeah.  Jimmy's basically saying your mom's loose.  No, I'm saying the truth to that.  No, she was so taken.  I don't know.  Maybe.  She was so taken.  Yeah.  Like, so, like, you know what I mean?  It's like a lot of times you're a mom and you fucking, you know, you get through that crisis.  She's probably never had it like that.  I bet you if you read her diary, the first entrance was, oh, oh, my God.  Oh, my former God.  Oh, my you-know-who. 
[03:51:30]  Florida Steve from Washington, D.C. writes, she screams, I want to taste my ass.  I never had anyone who asked him out before.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, no.  Seven years, you got married, and she didn't see you get married, huh?  No.  Does that bother you?  No.  Come on, a little bit's gotta hurt.  So, you must have not had a great relationship growing up with your mom, then?  No, that's the thing, is that we had a great relationship.  Oh, no! 
[03:52:00]  No, she was like the mom, you know, like, that you want to have.  Yeah, I think my brother is more affected than I am.  What did daddy do to your mom?  Nothing.  Did you ever call her and say, what the fuck happened to you?  Did they get a divorce, obviously?  Mm-hmm.  At what age?  I was 20.  Wait, divorce, and then gone?  Yeah.  So, she, like, disowned you guys before she, you know, hooked up with this guy, unless she  was seeing this guy.  We don't know.  Oh, you say you don't know.  But it was all very quick.  I'm sure it was sneaky. 
[03:52:30]  Did she was pregnant?  No.  I don't believe that you're not hurt, though.  That's a very devastating thing, because all of a sudden, she's gone.  No, I dealt with it a long time ago.  Did you ever call her and just go, what the fuck did you mean?  Painting swastikas on synagogues?  How did you deal with it?  When she left, yeah, all the time.  Nothing.  But I mean, now, like, seven years later.  That's all right.  No.  Like, how could you fucking reject your children?  No, I will probably get in touch with her one day.  Right now, my house.  Oh, no, you will?  Well, I figure I will one day, but not right now.  What was her answer when you said, where'd you go?  Oh, that it's none of my business.  What an out that was. 
[03:53:00]  It's none of his business.  Yeah, it's after Opie Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You should know that by now.  And, I mean, that's an unbelievable story that Travis told on the air.  That was a couple years ago at this point.  But since then, he still hasn't spoken to his mom whatsoever.  And that she just ran off out of nowhere.  Because he always said she was such, like, a loving and caring mom.  Like, she sounds not too dissimilar from the way my mom was when we were kids. 
[03:53:30]  Like, very sort of loving your mom.  Yeah.  Like, when you were growing up, like, she was there, and she was your mom.  She worked at my elementary school.  Like, yeah.  She's the student, like, whatever.  The mother who comes in and helps out.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And makes cupcakes on your birthday.  And then all of a sudden, I was wondering, when you were talking earlier on the show today,  you said that she kind of seemed to get a little loopy, maybe, when her parents died.  Yeah, I mean, things just...  In hindsight.  Yeah, things just started to change.  Like, she was always very... 
[03:54:00]  She wasn't ashamed of getting old, I want to say.  You know, like, she never dyed her hair.  She was always proud that, you know, oh, I got gray hair, blah, blah, blah.  And then one day, she dyed her gray.  So, you know, like, just little things like that.  How soon after her parents died, did she run off with this guy?  Oh, a while.  Oh, okay, so it wasn't such a...  No, it wasn't, like, an immediate thing.  But I would say that that probably had something to do with it.  And to your knowledge...  I mean, when we're kids, we don't know for sure.  But to your knowledge, your parents never... 
[03:54:30]  Like, they weren't at each other's throats or something?  Oh, never, never.  No, no, no, no.  That's insane.  Was she older when she left?  You know, like...  Well, no, she's older now.  Well, I know that.  But you know what I mean?  Like, was she...  She was...  This was 10 years ago.  She was in her mid-40s.  And you don't have anger?  Or you do have some anger?  No, no, not anymore.  Because it doesn't...  Kind of...  It was 10 years ago.  You get over these things.  And you have a kid now. 
[03:55:00]  Mm-hmm.  But you said on the show that makes this whole thing even stranger to you.  It's even more mind-boggling.  And I think, like, any parent would agree that it's just...  I can't fathom saying my job with you is done.  I'm finished now.  I'm going to go do some...  I'm done now.  Now, what if you were...  Especially when you were such a loving parent.  Yeah.  You know, if you were, like, a neglectful parent that, like, didn't really care, didn't really  want kids, then sure, I can see that.  Like, tons of people, you know, don't want anything to do with their kids.  But not...  Just, like, switch. 
[03:55:30]  That's almost like bipolar.  It really is.  And when you don't have symptoms of bipolar disorder before, it comes...  It's like, what?  Yeah.  Now, what if a very attractive Jewish man said, Travis, come with me and leave your  daughter behind with your wife?  Would that make it a little more...  I'd have to rethink maybe this is the genetic thing.  Right.  Because you're like, he's very attractive, and my mom seemed happy, so it's like, which  way do I go?  And you did take quite a beating on the air that day.  It's funny.  You understand.  Eric, is that going to be part of... 
[03:56:00]  Because we're doing a...  I think it came to...  We actually brainstormed this on the After Show, probably a couple months ago at this  point, after Jim Brewer called his mother live on the air when his mother was going  through this shit with his dad, which we don't even have time to get into that whole  thing, but we're going to do, for Thanksgiving, a special just on mothers of people related  to this show, and I would think, Eric, you know, you're kind of putting the clips together. 
[03:56:30]  Travis's mother saga would be prominently featured.  Yes.  What do you think of...  Does it occur to you that you don't want to give her as much attention as she's given  on the air?  On this show?  Well, no.  No, that doesn't bother me at all.  Because it's negative attention.  Yeah, it's negative attention.  In no way am I making her look like a good person right now.  Yeah.  For once, this is the only time ever when every fan is on your side.  Well, I...  Like, there's no, like, ah, you deserved it. 
[03:57:00]  Everybody thinks she's a horrible person.  No, I have no problem with this.  You said that you found...  Will you be able to listen back to it?  You don't care.  When?  Just now?  No, no, no.  When we replay the whole thing on Thanksgiving.  Sure.  Yeah.  You won't care because it's all jokes.  Yeah, it's funny.  But you said you know what state she's in now.  Yeah.  There's no part of you that's kind of tempted to just have that one conversation?  Yeah, well, yes, but I'm not going to let myself be the one that reaches out to her. 
[03:57:30]  Right.  Because when my parents were going through the divorce and she was starting to contact  myself and my brother and my uncle less and less and less, I was always that person that  was, you know, contacting her and keeping the relationship going.  And the last time I spoke to her, I said, look, if you want this relationship to continue,  you need to make, you know, some sort of effort to show me that you want that and to contact  me.  And she never did.  And I don't want to.  Yeah.  You don't want to go back to that thing where you're calling every three or four days because 
[03:58:00]  you realize that the only reason I would want to talk to her is, like I said, just to get  answers as to as to why she ended up being like that was the divorce and then her running  away one movement.  Uh, yeah, I mean, it was or did she did she like move out to a close place and then end  up she she she left and she stayed in the state.  And then once the divorce was finalized, I think she's moved around a few times since 
[03:58:30]  then.  Wow.  But so I know that she's moved at least twice because, you know, my dad had to send, you  know, checks because that's that's the fair thing to do.  Yeah.  I'm going to leave you with that.  What does she need checks for?  Yeah.  With especially you guys were adults and she remarried, didn't you?  Mm hmm.  And she left you.  Mm hmm.  Wow.  So how is your dad with the whole thing at this point?  At this point. 
[03:59:00]  I'm sure then he was like this is like just mind blowing and furious at this point and hurt.  You know, he yeah.  Um, but but he's remarried.  He's been married for five, four years.  Mm hmm.  So, you know, obviously, you know, bad things happen for, you know, a reason.  And he's in a better spot now.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  She comes back.  Yeah, that's yes.  That will happen.  I'm here to claim my 30 year old children to the house we no longer live at.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:59:30]  What do you mean you moved away?  It's only been nine years.  Um, but do you know if she has a family?  No.  Oh, I have no idea.  So you don't know any.  No, I just did you ever meet the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At a at at an event that I didn't.  It was like one of my friends parties and she was there and she showed up with him.  Yeah.  Which was like right during the whole thing, which is I was like, you're out of your mind.  Yeah.  You're a crazy person.  But no, I looked her up on a thing that.  Right. 
[04:00:00]  The thing where we look up people in the newspaper when they're on.  Oh, and that's how you found her.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  And she's still with that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did you think?  Can you I guess at the time, obviously you would have hated him regardless, but because  of the divorce and everything.  What do you think of that guy?  He's a piece of shit.  He is.  Yes.  And when you and you knew this.  Yeah.  When when they were originally going to get divorced, they they they sat down and they  said, we don't want to get lawyers involved.  We don't want to do any of that.  Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[04:00:30]  Because they had such an amicable relationship.  Everything she wanted to leave.  She didn't want to, you know, hurt us financially.  Her new husband was from what I've heard, a divorce lawyer.  So he gets into her head and, you know, you really should.  I mean, this is just what you deserve after all this time.  As far as I'm concerned, he's a piece of shit.  And my my opinion on that will never change.  It's amazing that you can have a good relationship, raise kids that you love, and then somehow 
[04:01:00]  feel like you deserve something like that was the good.  You just got the good stuff.  You you you got what people don't get.  And now, well, I mean, it's insane.  It's really it's like it's movie type stuff.  Did you when it was first happening, were you like, how is this reality?  Like, yeah, I mean, this is what's mind boggling.  Like people get left and stuff.  But what's mind boggling is how long was the process from she is, you know, Susie Homemaker, 
[04:01:30]  my mommy to I don't know who this person is anymore.  When was that?  When was the benchmark for for it was like this is this is my mom.  When when was the wrestling?  Oh, this is a funny story, Travis.  And I bring it up.  And this is the cruelty that Travis has to deal with on a daily basis, because Travis  a couple of years ago told me that when WWE and WCW merged, the last episode of Monday 
[04:02:00]  Nitro, which is the WCW show, was a big deal because the WWE guys were going to be on it.  So everyone who was a wrestling fan at this time and even not was watching.  This was the biggest thing.  The biggest wrestling show of all time.  And Travis's parents, Travis came home.  This is Travis.  He's walking home.  I ran home.  And he's all excited because it's like, say, 10 to 8.  And the show comes on at 8. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  Right.  And he's running home.  And he's like, oh, this is going to be the fucking shit.  Yeah.  It's the last episode of Nitro.  I'm going to grab a snack.  I'm going to go down to the basement.  What was the snack going to be?  Probably, you know, like chips or something.  The kind of chips and a soft drink.  I'm not doing any homework.  This is going to be awesome.  And he walks in the house.  And right before he can get to the TV, he's got his hand right by the remote.  His parents say, Travis, we need to talk to you about something.  And instead of watching the last episode of Monday Nitro, that's when Travis finds out 
[04:03:00]  that his parents are getting divorced.  So from that time, the time he told me that forward, probably at least once every two weeks,  give or take, if you're lucky, I'll say, Travis, what did you think of the last episode of  Monday Nitro?  And he'll have to tell me I missed it.  And I'll say why.  And he'll say.  And I wasn't going to record it because I was going to watch it live.  Right.  And you're not really.  After your parents, who have brought you up so lovingly after all these years, tell 
[04:03:30]  you they're getting divorced, programming a VCR isn't at the tip top of the brain.  No, no, no.  So when was that?  That was March 26, 2001.  2001.  Okay.  So you got.  Okay.  So from March, the last time I talked to her was November.  So what?  Six months?  Wow.  Seven months.  So you didn't see it coming, the divorce at all?  No, no, no, no, no.  So it was like the day, the day of the day you found out, it was still like, everything's  happy.  Sure.  And then that one moment, and then over the course of the next six months, she just 
[04:04:00]  became this random person that you'd never met before.  Yeah.  I would probably, I would, it was probably like four months because then, you know, we, we  maintained a relationship for, for a couple months.  Yeah.  So yeah.  Like four months.  It's just so strange.  Like when people get divorced to change on that level, to that level.  It was a major change.  That wasn't like, Hey, we're getting divorced.  I don't love your dad anymore.  I'm still going to see you around.  Cause you know, I'm still a normal person.  Wow.  Yeah.  Because like, like Jess's parents are divorced and you know, it was shaky at first as any 
[04:04:30]  divorces, but they hang out all the time.  Now, Jess sees both her parents and her parents see each other and they laugh together.  And it's like a normal, a divorce is a divorce.  Like, you know, people fall out of love.  Like, what are you going to do?  Like, I'm not, I'm not mad.  It happens.  Yeah.  I was never mad at her for, for not wanting to be with my dad anymore.  Like that shit happens.  And it's honestly probably worse for kids when parents stay together, even though they  should, for the kids, even though they should be divorcing.  Cause kids pick up on that stuff. 
[04:05:00]  Mars, Paul, Eric, Eric, your parents aren't divorced.  Did your parents get divorced?  No, my parents are still together.  Mars?  My parents are divorced.  Your parents are divorced.  Yeah.  And how old were you when they got divorced?  Oh, I was in the twenties, I believe.  So around when Travis was more or less.  Yeah.  It was my father.  He left and he's gone.  He's gone for good.  Yeah.  Did he, how was, did that surprise you or was that kind of, was he always kind of a little  bit absentee?  No, it surprised me.  Cause again, he was a man that used to, you know, take care of the family, come home,  you know, do well and take care.  And he's gone, gone now. 
[04:05:30]  And he's gone, gone.  He just like got a new family and it's fucked up, right?  Like people think that like, oh, well I'm divorcing.  So this whole part of my life and all these people, I'm divorcing them all.  I don't have to deal with them at all anymore.  Look, I understand that my daughter is going to grow up and become a person and you know,  I'm not going to like, you know, have that, that child anymore, but I still don't  understand like how you would never want to talk to, to your kid again.  And I could understand me, but my little sister, she's not a little, four years younger, but  she had such closeness to him and he's gone. 
[04:06:00]  And she would have been like a late teenager at that point when you left.  It's like, wow, what's wrong with people?  Yeah.  It's like you raise a kid and obviously he raised you, you raise this kid and you don't,  you don't, Roland just opened the door and he keeled over pointing and laughing at Travis.  Oh, Travis.  Yes.  Yes.  Roland just came in to laugh at Travis, but I don't understand how parents can't have  that thing where they want to see this person become an adult, you know, like you think 
[04:06:30]  like that's where the parent, I would think in my mind, maybe I don't know what I'm talking  about and I guess I don't, but I would think as a parent, you want to be like, okay, now  I get to sit back and the cool part is watching this person become an adult that I raised.  And I see that in a lot of people and I think in the era of our parents, they think that  just up to 18, that's it.  The job is done.  It's like it's a job.  The obligation is done.  That's it.  But it's not true, man.  It's not a job.  It's life.  But if you're a messy kid, you live with your parents until you're 42.  Really? 
[04:07:00]  I don't even know if that's a stereotype or not.  But you know, like Travis has a kid, you know, I mean, this woman should be around, you  know, that it's.  Yeah, but you know what?  She's not, so that sucks for her.  It's her loss.  I mean, yeah, you have a happy family now, obviously.  Listen, I've seen the Instagram pictures.  You have a very happy family.  Yeah, we're doing just fine.  My father hasn't seen, he doesn't even know that I have three kids.  Yeah, you have three kids.  You have a happy family.  He doesn't deserve it.  Yeah, he doesn't need it.  And you know that like the people who leave, like when people leave you, it becomes possible 
[04:07:30]  to let it go because you're not doing anything like you just keep doing yourself.  But when you leave people like that negativity has to stay with you because your mom has to  physically she left you.  She is not talking to you like you're open to whatever, like whatever happens, happens.  But like I can't see how she could possibly be OK with it deep down inside.  Yeah, exactly.  Like that has to stay.  And same thing with your dad.  Like at some level, no matter how much you want to put over it, no matter how much machismo  or how much, you know, Jewish sperm as it was, you want to cover this whole thing up with 
[04:08:00]  somewhere it's down there.  My hope is that when she's old and her husband dies before her, she sits back and realizes  what she did.  Was her husband older?  Their new husband?  I'm not sure.  They're probably a couple of years.  But fingers crossed he'll be dead first.  Fingers crossed.  Like way first.  Like hopefully some kind of accident.  Like she's still very capable mentally of processing what happened.  Hopefully today.  Yeah.  That's me saying that. 
[04:08:30]  And it's just like an accident.  Not like something like, but maybe like a car wreck or whatever it is.  Like.  Bear attack.  A bear attack.  Like he's just hiking or something.  And all of a sudden the bear rips his head off.  Something.  I don't know what it is.  But that way it would all work out.  Well, thanks for sharing Mars, Travis.  No problem.  Roland, you didn't really share much, but that's part for the course, I guess.  More on the Thanksgiving special.  Yeah.  And this was all one big plug for the big Thanksgiving special that we're only focusing  on mothers.  That way we can rerun it on Mother's Day. 
[04:09:00]  You see what I mean?  We don't have a name for it yet because we're not clever people, but that'll be on Thanksgiving.  Before Thanksgiving is tomorrow.  And that's when Opie and Anthony will be back live.  This after show and, you know, all these families, all this drama wouldn't have happened  if it were only for Trojan bearskin condoms.  Trojan America's number one most trusted condom.  None of this would have happened.  But even Paul's mom's back.  He'll probably wouldn't have happened.  Yeah.  I guess.  I guess that's the case, too.  You should have said fantastic kill empire. 
[04:09:30]  That's what you meant, Roland.  No, I know I meant.  And Roland tasted it.  He would know.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I shall.  Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony live continue tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
