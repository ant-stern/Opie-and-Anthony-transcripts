<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing workplace annoyances, specifically one host's frustration over colleagues constantly bumping his chair.  This transitioned into a conversation about their upcoming move to a new building and their ongoing discontent with XM's corporate restrictions, using the example of limitations placed on a planned "bowling" segment.  

Anthony then recounted his recent appearance on Sean Hannity's show, providing a detailed description of his experience,  including humorous comparisons of his appearance to various celebrities. He also discussed his interactions with other guests, particularly Dana Perino, offering observations on her appearance and demeanor.  The discussion significantly shifted to Anthony's segment on the Somali pirate situation, featuring their outspoken and often profane opinions on the topic.  They revisited Anthony’s Hannity appearance, analyzing his performance, particularly his comments on the pirates.

The show then moved to a discussion of the Jamie Foxx controversy surrounding his comments about Miley Cyrus.  A clip of the segment was played, followed by an extensive debate on the appropriateness of Foxx’s remarks and the public reaction.  They briefly touched upon a past radio incident involving a fatal water-drinking contest, and reminisced about an awkward interview with Allison Stewart of MSNBC.  Hulk Hogan and Bruce Springsteen were also mentioned throughout this section.

The broadcast continued with a discussion focused on identifying a woman from a music video, initially believed to be associated with Lynyrd Skynyrd or a related band.  After some speculation, they concluded she was in a 38 Special video, with comments on her appearance, referring to her as a "red-headed bitch," and her 80s hairstyle. The conversation then veered towards a rumor about Bruce Springsteen's alleged relationship with a 40-something-year-old nurse from a Jersey gym.  The hosts also mentioned plans to discuss this rumor and a Hulk Hogan story later in the show. The segment concluded with the hosts preparing for their bowling outing, commenting on the surprisingly long bowling alley.  No guests appeared in studio during the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I've been dealing with a twisted testicle. 
[00:04:00]  She wrote out a prescription that basically said, warm baths, they would look like alligator  eyes popping out of the water.  What's the best show on TV?  I think it's called Three Sheets.  I don't know where Anthony is in relation to the wind when he's driving.  I have a red light in my bathroom.  Wow.  We're showering with a chick.  We have a red light.  You're always thinking of how you can look a little better. 
[00:04:30]  Exactly.  So I have a blindfolded.  I have a blindfolded.  I had a girl.  She comes in.  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Everything working?  Yes.  Seems to be.  Day two from the serious, let's be honest, the serious building.  I know.  XM.  It's not a...  Serious!  XM.  Yeah, that's pretty much the deal. 
[00:05:00]  Where do we begin?  Let me push my seat out a little more.  We should begin with that because...  Wow.  Now I'm in panic mode.  It is...  It's just getting worse by the day.  Yeah.  My chair is very close to a wall.  The back of my chair is very close to a wall, which wouldn't be a problem if everyone  didn't have to squeak by there to get to Opie before the show.  Not even just me, though.  No, no, no.  Because there's like a nerve center back here. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, that's what I mean.  And they have to get under this console.  It's a very high traffic area because before the show, there's a lot of hustle and bustle  with getting used stuff, the engineers setting stuff up and everything.  And so no less than, I would guess, 30 times someone has to walk behind my chair while  I'm trying to read the paper and eat and go through websites and things like that.  I think everybody...  Let me name off the people that didn't hit my chair. 
[00:06:00]  Opie and even Sam clipped it with his big clumsy foot, but not that bad.  And Travis did tap it, but not by much.  Not by much.  Everyone else, though...  Wait a minute.  That says a lot about me.  Oh, I know.  So let's stop and enjoy that for a second.  Let's, oh, do we have to enjoy it?  Let's enjoy it.  Let's enjoy that.  Because you said I was the only one that didn't tap your chair, and I'm the one that 
[00:06:30]  has walked back and forth the most.  Yeah, yes.  Thank you.  That is true.  A very caring soul right here.  Nary a tap on my chair from Opie.  Did you enjoy that moment?  I enjoyed the moment.  All right, good.  We were meant to enjoy it.  Everybody else hit the chair.  And here's the problem.  And Opie pointed this out, too.  He goes, people look like...  And I go, oh, my God, you just hit my chair.  And they're like, oh, sorry.  Like, it's no big deal.  I just hit your chair. 
[00:07:00]  I won't do it again.  But they're the 10th person, the 11th person, the 12th person that hit my chair.  Well, they think they're doing good because they only hit you once.  Yeah.  Because they've walked behind you a few times, so they figure, well, if I'm walking behind  them five times, I hit them once.  That's good.  No, but it's not because everyone else is me kicking my chair.  And I'm just looking.  It's getting to the point now where people walk by me, and you notice this. 
[00:07:30]  I tense up.  My shoulders go up.  Yeah.  And I tense up just anticipating the bwap on the chair.  It's driving me crazy.  Yeah.  We got to shave down the huge table that we're broadcasting on.  The unnecessarily giant console.  Was that on the air? 
[00:08:00]  Really?  Was that on the air?  I hope that's on the air.  Yes, it is.  No.  I think it was just in my headphones.  And now Mars goes, no, that's not on the air.  But Mars, we can all hear you, Mars.  Right.  He's like.  In the middle of us talking, I just hear Mars talking in my headphones.  Did instant feedback.  Did anybody hear that out there?  No.  But the best part.  I got your mic on.  I don't know.  Oh, they don't have it.  Wait, try that one.  The best part is that he's saying, now no one else can hear you.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  No one else can hear you but me.  This means nothing because it was in our headphones.  But right in the middle of our little discussion, Mars was saying something in the headphones.  Oh, someone's got a good idea here.  I should just, the second my phone, my chair gets tapped, just push myself from the console against them and check them into the wall.  Chair check them.  They'll learn.  They'll learn.  I'll learn them.  Well, then they hung a tapestry, an Opie and Anthony Sirius XM satellite radio tapestry behind it. 
[00:09:00]  And because the air conditioning blows all our bits and everything else around the studio, it comes away from the wall, which makes people go, oh, I got to avoid that.  So now they're getting even closer.  Yes, closer to the back of your chair.  I pulled the armrests all the way down, and I'm now under the seat.  I see that.  That's the feeling.  Jimmy just did it.  And it's like the same feeling.  Yeah.  It's fun, actually.  Is it?  It feels good.  Because now it's going to become a thing where people just do it for fun just to get me. 
[00:09:30]  Well, set up like a little thing to your right.  I should put like a highway cone here or something.  Yes.  Yes.  Put a highway cone.  I see we got our bowling balls.  Yes.  And our bowling pins.  Yeah, we're going to do a little bowling today.  We're going to be bowling down the long hallway.  And because the one thing we're going to try to do now that we're in this new building is bring fun back to radio.  Fun!  Did you get the email yesterday?  There was a discussion going back and forth all afternoon. 
[00:10:00]  About the bowling.  About the dumb bowling bit we want to do for like 15 minutes.  We have this really long hallway, and we want to do some bowling.  I want to see if Jimmy can do some bowling, and Ant and I, and then maybe some of the employees here.  We'll bond with the people over here.  Yeah.  There were discussions.  Steve's like, well, it still hasn't been approved.  This was like 3 in the afternoon.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  It's a dumb bowling bit.  It's just bowling.  And then they finally approved it.  As long as we're using soft, soft bowling balls, plastic pins, and then they're like, and we want the whole bit wrapped up by 8.15. 
[00:10:30]  8.15 people come in, and God forbid they see something that's out of the ordinary and might get a chuckle.  Right.  Now we know that's when we have to start it.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, now we know start time.  We know it has to be retard safe physically.  We're just going to keep pointing out what's wrong with radio.  Right there.  That's something that is wrong with radio.  Why would you wrap up a fun bit at 8.15?  It's supposed to be fun. 
[00:11:00]  You ever see the documentary on Pixar?  How the people were going through the hallways on little scooters, and they hang up things, and it looks like a fun place to work.  Yeah, it's an environment for creativity.  Yeah.  This place is not an environment for creativity.  I'm sorry, it's not.  It's like where they raise veal, this place.  Yeah.  They put living things in small spaces and want them to stay there and don't cohabitate with each other. 
[00:11:30]  And then they've got the glass offices, so everyone's paranoid.  They've got to make believe they're working.  And then I hear from Steve, it's like, in Paris, they thought you'd do anything they'd tell you not to do.  There's cameras everywhere.  Oh, and they like checking their cameras.  Oh, there are cameras everywhere.  Are there really?  Oh, man.  See that little thing up on the ceiling right there?  That's a camera.  There's another one over there.  That's a clock with no 12.  Yeah.  I was just counting my money.  A little money laundering.  Changing dollar bills. 
[00:12:00]  What?  When I left my BlackBerry in the...  You see that?  It looked like clock, you dummy.  When I left my BlackBerry in the bathroom about two months ago, and then someone took it,  these guys are on the security cameras like that.  Like, they do this on a regular basis.  Oh, yeah.  And they had three or four suspects.  And then they got rooms in this joint, by the way.  Oh, believe me.  I know.  It's like the Tangiers.  They got rooms that they smash your hand with a hammer.  They got back rooms in this place.  Absolutely. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  And guess what?  That BlackBerry showed up.  Yeah, see?  People get scared.  There's cameras.  I'm scared, and next thing you know, I get a phone call.  Oh, they found your BlackBerry.  Camera scanners.  I go, where did they find it?  Right where you left it.  Yeah.  Okay, sure.  Someone returned it.  Yeah, okay.  Could you check the camera and see who returned it?  Well, that's what I was getting at.  They checked the cameras, and they saw who was coming and going out of that bathroom.  And they had it down to three or four guys.  Because then they see me coming back into the bathroom to retrieve my phone that I left behind. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  So then they're like, okay, between him leaving the bathroom and him going back in the bathroom,  there's three guys that we have to question.  The producer watches the show staff.  The executive producer watches the producer.  The boss watches the executive producer.  The supervisor.  Nice.  All right.  We're going to go to John on Long Island.  Let's see if the phones work today.  John, what's going on?  Hey there, Jan.  Welcome aboard.  Hello, boys.  Anthony, I just want to congratulate you on your new show, Hannity and Kumia. 
[00:13:30]  You hit it out of the park, my friend.  Thank you, my friend.  My good friend.  I couldn't believe it.  I said you answered everything perfectly.  You added just the right amount of humor.  Barissimo.  Ah, thank you.  Yes.  I did look like a ghoul.  But my hair had moose cum in it.  And by moose, he means a blonde boy from the Archies. 
[00:14:00]  You're perfect for that show.  And Hannity kept looking to his right like, I know I got Anthony on my side today.  I was fun.  I got Anthony.  And then they set you up like it was your show.  He's dead center on the TV.  You got papers like you're a newsman.  I was busy.  Why were you the only one that had papers?  I had the important breaking news about the pirates going after the second American ship.  Right.  So I had the breaking news sheet in front of me.  You look like a silent film star or something. 
[00:14:30]  Yes, I know.  Look at me.  You could go through the Twitters.  There are 50 to 100 comments about who and what I look like.  Oh, yeah.  And everything.  There were a lot of Raul.  I thought Raul Julia was dead.  Gomez Adams.  A lot of Gomez Adams.  A lot of Gomez Adams.  Uncle Paul.  Oh, my God.  That's exactly who you are.  Uncle Paul popped up a few times. 
[00:15:00]  A lot of people goofing on the follicles.  You just have a very different look when you take that hat off.  Oh, I know.  Well, that's it.  You know what it is?  When you get used to somebody wearing anything for the length of time that I've been wearing a hat,  it's just different when you take it off.  So I took it off, and then the makeup girl and then the hair girl comes in and moosed my hair up  because I guess it was very humid and I was getting a little frizzy,  and moosed it down where if you remember what Archie Bunker looked like during his gun editorial on that episode 
[00:15:30]  where we were talking about the hijacking and how they should give guns to everybody.  But that's how my hair was slicked down.  But I didn't care.  All ready for TV.  I just don't even...  Anyone do the John Waters on you?  Yes.  Someone said a mix between John Waters and Steve Buscemi.  Wow.  Yes.  So Steve Buscemi, it kept going and going.  They wouldn't stop, but it was very funny. 
[00:16:00]  You had some power hitters on there, too.  Oh, yes.  And you hung right in there.  What's her name?  The old press secretary.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dana.  She bugged me.  She's a piece of ass, though, man.  She was a very pretty girl.  Yeah, but she bugged me when she was like...  Because Jamie Foxx made fun of Miley Cyrus, who gives a shit.  And then she was like, well, no one cares if someone's making fun of a woman.  Shut up.  A woman?  Yeah.  Quiet.  That's why I kind of went like, meh.  Not broad.  But she was filling out some kind of application in the green room. 
[00:16:30]  It was pretty funny, because she's just like, former job.  She goes, yeah.  She said, you'd think I'd have enough clearance already.  Right.  And she goes, address, 1600 Pennsylvania.  Reason for leaving, last job, bomb threats.  Actually, it said reason for leaving, last job.  And she goes, election.  Really?  Yeah.  You know, it was one of those deals where it's like, she's just filling out an application. 
[00:17:00]  It's just amazing.  You think she's past that now.  Yeah.  Now that she worked at the White House.  But no.  She's just like everybody else.  No.  It was cool, though, man.  You know?  Hannity's great.  We had a lot of fun.  We were talking after the show.  And they love Jimmy over there.  Oh, my God.  They love Jimmy like a little pet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's like, Jimmy's great on the show.  Sean was saying this.  He goes, I always talk to him before the show.  And I'm like, Jimmy, you get me thrown off of here. 
[00:17:30]  How can I kill you?  Well, Sean, he's got a little twist in his personality.  We all know it.  There's a dark side there.  Oh, absolutely.  He said him and his wife were watching your special on HBO and just laughing their asses  off.  He goes, but oh, my God.  Wow.  I was like, yeah, that's our little boy.  He's a fresh mouth.  Yes, he certainly is a naughty lad.  What did he mean by wow?  He got a hard on watching Jimmy?  No.  He enjoyed it.  Wow.  That kid's got gams. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Then he was goofing on Opie for the fact that he wants you to get on there and give your  ultra, for some reason, your ultra left liberal side.  All of a sudden, I've become this heavy liberal.  Compared to him and Ant you are, but compared to most people, you're very sad.  I'm more in the middle, I think.  He's just talking about taxes and whatnot and the fact that we both have the same hand  in our back pocket, but I seem to care more about it. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  It's one of those things.  He really digs the show and things like that.  He listens when he can.  I have no desire to go on that show.  No?  No.  I hate politics.  I faked it for so long.  Talk about something else.  That's the beauty.  I can't be bothered by politics.  It is kind of good.  If something pops up, you're just...  Dude, you should go on and just make the most ridiculous points on purpose.  Wow, would that be funny?  Yeah, like...  Just to not make any sense.  Praise the Iranian president and his excellent wardrobe. 
[00:19:00]  What a snappy dresser he is.  No matter what Sean says, just be so liberal that it's obviously a goof.  I think I got an angle now.  Let's say hi to Jordan as in...  Oh, wow.  Michael Jordan checking in.  Michael.  Hey, how's it going, boy?  You sound so...  You sound a little short on radio.  Hey, Anthony, you killed last night, man.  That was pretty good.  And about the Pirates, you know, if they'd just send some frickin' Jets out there and  bomb us, you know, all that would come to a stop. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, they...  You know, you get the liberal kind of Democrat.  Yeah.  You know, they don't want to hear about bombings without this long-winded preface and then this  other...  I was just saying that the Somalis, they do have a base that they work from off of the  coast.  They're not very organized.  They're pretty good out at sea.  But most of them are very young and stupid.  They just are well-armed for the ocean, considering these ships that they're taking over don't have 
[00:20:00]  any arms on them.  And they go out and take over these boats.  But they're based on the land somewhere.  They're not fish.  So bomb the crap out of them.  Well, do you want the liberal point of view?  Sure.  Blow them to...  Blow them out of the water.  I was trying to say smithereens.  It's very hard to get them in the water because it's a lot of area to cover.  But the land bases that they have are very close to the beach. 
[00:20:30]  They have to load these things, these boats and weapons, onto these big boats, take them  out to sea, and then let those Zodiacs out.  So bomb the bases.  Let these ships have weapons.  That's another thing.  End of the problem.  Yeah, for some reason, merchant ships are banned from having weapons.  Right, right.  Why?  You blow a few of these guys out of the water, it's done.  Have a security team.  Make it so they have to even...  If you don't want to just arm the captain or anything, make it so each one of these 
[00:21:00]  things can hire a security team that are well-trained.  Hire some of those Navy SEALs.  Yeah, get some Navy SEALs.  Or Club Soda Kenny.  I see you both.  Do you?  I'm still in...  We're in New York Harbor, idiot.  He storms like a passenger ship by...  Staten Island Ferry.  I made a little bit of good joke if I didn't say he storms a passenger ship by something.  By George.  By gum.  Those Navy SEALs, though.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, wow, wow. 
[00:21:30]  Awesome.  They showed a picture of that lifeboat that they were in, and you just see bullet holes  through the windows.  So they not only were on topsy-turvy seas and zoomed in on these guys' heads with their  scopes, but they shot through the windows.  That's amazing.  And nailed them.  Imagine those dummies just sitting there, that last second, just, whoa, what just happened?  I know what you wanted to do there.  Yeah, well, of course.  Little clicks and a few clacks. 
[00:22:00]  Anthony on Hannity.  My mic sounds awful, doesn't it?  No.  Sounds fine.  Really?  Honestly, yeah.  Sounds all right.  Maybe your headphones are up loud.  I notice you've got to tune the headphones down a little more than the last place.  Yeah.  All right.  Or it gets a little tinny in there.  In my head, it sounds like a Mr. Microphone.  Ah.  Yeah.  Here's Ant getting introduced on Hannity's show last night.  Oh.  He is the co-host of the ever-infamous Opie and the Anthony Show, which broadcasts on  Sirius XM satellite radio.  Anthony, cool me, is with us. 
[00:22:30]  How are you?  I just call you Opie, and that's...  Yeah, I know.  What is wrong with him?  He doesn't want to show up because he's a big liberal?  Yeah.  I think he's getting a little scared to come on your show now because, yeah, he's leaning  more liberal these days.  And I don't understand it with, you know, we both have the same government hand in our  pocket.  I don't enjoy it.  I can't see how he does.  Oh, 40, 50 percent.  We're going to get into that in a minute.  We're going to get into that in a minute.  I'm just very angry.  It moves quickly there.  Yes, he does.  And you know, like, when you...  Well, because he's just nervous all the time that you're going to say something stupid. 
[00:23:00]  Well, he's good.  He wants to get everybody involved.  And it's like, you're chomping at the bit because you see the topic coming up.  You're like, oh, pirates.  And then he'll go, now, David.  And you're like, fuck, I'm not David.  Talk about pirates.  I got a pirate line I got to get out.  Don't go to him.  I've done it with that guy before.  The black guy.  He was...  He's a nice dude.  He's a nice dude.  But he is a bore.  Yeah, he's very...  He's a very liberal...  A very liberal fella.  Yeah.  And yeah, he is a boring black guy, which is so rare.  You don't find many...  You don't find many dull black guys, but he's one of them.  Yeah, he was...  He's very soft-spoken. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Very...  If he disagrees with Hannity, he'll just be like, yeah, no, I don't think that's the way it  is.  He took you on the elevator, and he grabs you by the throat, and he grabbed me, and he  goes, keep your mouth quiet, white boy.  I'm like, I'm sorry, sir.  Someone removed someone's hat.  He kind of has a little of that in his eyes.  In his eyes.  It's so weird...  When he's out with his friends, it's a little different, I bet you.  Yeah.  He dresses different.  No more suit and tie.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't play the part when he's out and about.  Does Dana have a nice ass? 
[00:24:00]  She's a very pretty girl.  She must...  I bet you she's even hotter in person.  She was.  She has very nice eyes.  Yeah.  She just looked very nice.  She's very well put together.  Nice cans?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Big ones?  Not really.  For her size, they were appropriate.  Very good.  There was an intern over there, though.  A girl intern was really ample.  Yeah.  And they liked to just wear t-shirts and let the heaviness show. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  God bless you.  They were very weighty.  God bless you.  And apparently, she was saying her boyfriend's a fan, so hi.  Your girlfriend's got great tits.  Yeah, that was...  Ed talks about the Somalian pirates on Hannity last night.  What was so extraordinary?  What president wouldn't have allowed, you know, the firing to save a hostage?  Can you name one?  I'm saying he did the right thing, but he should be commended, because if he hadn't  done that, you'd be saying that he should have.  That's not it! 
[00:25:00]  Commended that that's one thing that he did right.  Okay.  Yeah, exactly.  I just don't like the word pirate.  It's too romanticized.  You expect Johnny Depp to swashbuckle over and cause shenanigans.  And these guys are bugs.  They're criminals.  Terrorists.  Terrorists.  They should be treated that way.  And I think, you know, obviously, I hate the idea of us being world police all the time,  but something's got to be done.  It's very hard to find these guys on the open sea.  I do think their bases, wherever they're located, should be taken out. 
[00:25:30]  These guys are a menace.  Nice.  A menace.  They're a menace!  And the former press secretary agreed with you.  Yes!  That's kind of neat.  Just wipe them out.  And that's what I was trying to say, but I don't think the gentleman understood what I was trying to say.  I'm not like, just go in and bomb them.  You know, we do know where they are.  I'm saying, bomb them without going through all this bullshit, like the UN, or having to clean up later. 
[00:26:00]  Every time we bomb something, we feel like we owe them to go back later and clean up the mess.  Just get rid of them, pirates my ass.  If they were doing stuff like this close to the U.S. shore, we would...  Oh, forget about it.  Yeah.  It's amazing that it seems like a very easy thing to take care of, and they're not taking care of it.  I know.  How are you allowing these guys to get on your stupid, huge, massive ship? 
[00:26:30]  That's what I don't understand either.  This is an easy one.  Just don't let them on.  And apparently an American ship, again, was attacked last night, or yesterday afternoon.  Didn't get on board, though?  Got a little damage from some RPGs and gunfire, but they didn't get on board, yeah.  Were they able to step on their fingertips as they were climbing over the top?  I know.  That's another thing.  Just grind your heel down as they're climbing up.  That's their only weapon, to give them a good kick.  Are they swinging over with a knife in their teeth?  Right.  The arr! 
[00:27:00]  Ann argues with the rest of the panel.  I like this.  I thought this was going to get ugly about the pirates.  The world economy is also playing a factor in other parts of the world, like in Africa.  And these folks are just criminals that are getting on boats and going to hijack ships.  There's no camp you can go to to take them out.  There are shoreline, organized shoreline departure points.  They're not taking these little Zodiac boats out 30 miles out to sea.  There are what are called mother ships.  There are bases that they leave from. 
[00:27:30]  Bomb these areas.  Bomb them and kill these people.  I can't go that far.  Because they're not all organized like that.  A lot of them are copycats.  They have boats and they just go off and hijack other boats.  Still criminals.  So we just blow up people just to blow them up.  I think you're getting a little far.  I'm not going a little far.  I'm not just saying going.  Of course, some reconnaissance, intelligence.  We know.  Look at where they're coming from.  And eliminate the problem from the base.  I just think that we eliminate with targeted strikes terrorists in other areas. 
[00:28:00]  I think that you could do it here.  But it is a sticky wicket.  I mean, if you get into this, Somalia is, I'm not going to say it's a failed state because  I'm not an expert in that area.  But Somalia is just a country that has very little hope and it needs a lot of help.  But these people have to be.  Yeah, we tried that one.  Tough way.  Yeah.  The boat that was coming in was with humanitarian aid.  Ant, fucking great.  Hanging right in there with the big guys.  Why I.  He was kind of passive aggressive, too. 
[00:28:30]  He's like, oh, what, are you just going to kill everybody?  Yes.  They're criminals.  Yeah, why not?  You eliminate the problem.  It's a problem to be eliminated.  And it doesn't mean that we got to go in and help the country out.  Eliminate the problem.  And if the problem comes back again, you eliminate it again.  What are you going to do?  And she's like, I don't know if I'd call it a failed state.  Really?  What?  Could you think of a better example of a failed state?  None better example.  People are starving and they've resorted to pirate-ism.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Pirate-ism.  It's a failed state.  There's no government there.  There hasn't been in decades.  And yeah, it's a completely criminal run country.  These people, the entire economic structure is based on crime.  It's a failed state.  How bad do you want to...  We can't go in there like we did when we were trying to help them out during, you know,  when Blackhawk down, when that situation happened.  You know, we tried helping.  We tried humanitarian aid. 
[00:29:30]  And we got our asses handed to us.  So, fuck them.  I want to visit.  You want to visit Mogadishu or something?  Go down there.  How cool would that be?  Let's do our show from...  Everyone likes going to...  You know, Jimmy, everyone likes going to Iraq and the Green Zone and...  Ooh, how dangerous.  We're doing our show from Mogadishu.  Or let's just get a ship right off the coast of Somalia and do our show from there.  Do some pirate radio.  Pirate radio as we get attacked by pirates.  We'll be the first. 
[00:30:00]  I think that's the one place Jonathan said, my manager said, that he'd be scared to go  to.  That's completely lawless.  He does have a touch of sense in that head of his then.  Did you hear the statement?  He would be scared to go to.  Meaning he would still consider going there.  How do you go there?  And it talks about Jamie Foxx talking about Miley Cyrus.  I didn't even know this was going down until I was watching Hannity last night.  Yes, this was breaking news.  But Jamie Foxx from Sirius started going after Miley Cyrus.  Yeah.  Oh boy, I had to dance my way around this one, didn't I? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I saw.  You didn't know which side it'd be on.  Well, you know what it is.  I was thinking in a couple of different directions.  I was like, let me see how he handles this.  I was thinking in a couple of different directions.  One of which is, and I explain it in the clip, where I can't just outwardly say anybody  should be fired for what they say on the radio without coming off as a complete hypocrite.  And I don't believe he should be fired for anything he says on the radio, especially unregulated  satellite radio.  But another thing I'm thinking is, oh, they're going to get on my shit because I'm bashing 
[00:31:00]  or I would be bashing another person that's on the platform.  Oh, who cares?  On television.  I know.  That didn't really come into it.  As long as you don't bash, you know, the Messiah.  Of course.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Anyway.  I don't, to be honest with you, it's like the point you made was right.  It's like, should he get in trouble?  No.  No.  But it is interesting just to notice how like black activists don't get pissed off if 
[00:31:30]  a black, that's all.  But what he said wasn't bad.  It was funny.  And fuck Miley Cyrus.  She's a, she's a public figure.  Right.  She's two years away from being able to go to the electric chair.  She's make fun of all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what it is too?  Uh, people, uh, and even Hannity was saying just wonderful things about her.  They see her as this wonderful girl and everything.  When other girls, uh, like Lindsay Lohan before she was 18, uh, was getting bashed upon in  the media and no one really came to her defense because she was, you know, the parent of the 
[00:32:00]  Paris Hilton school of let me show my gash.  Uh, so no one really cared about that.  Well, let's see how it went down on Hannity.  I didn't think it was a big deal with Jamie Foxx said.  No, it's just because it was on Drudge.  And I, and I think that a lot of the shows, cause you know, Drudge is so big.  They go down Drudge.  They find interesting stories.  Cause they don't have five nights a week of topics.  Right.  So you got to have shit to talk about.  All right.  Now you, here you, they get fired and then they come back.  So they take a vacation.  Then they come back.  You don't have the greatest track.  I got to tell you, it's, it's really nice to be on.  Oh, we don't have the, uh, the actual Jamie Foxx clip. 
[00:32:30]  Ooh.  We're probably not allowed to play it.  I want to hear it on center.  It's a news story.  It's a goddamn news story.  Is it part of this clip though?  I don't think so.  No, cause they beep it anyway.  I'd love to hear it on center.  Do we have that?  I didn't.  Yeah, they did beep it.  Cause this doesn't really make sense unless we got the original Jamie Foxx clip.  Cause that's what Ann's reacting to.  And we'll, we'll pause here.  We'll go back to Ann on Hannity in a few minutes.  But I did mention one thing, uh, that it was kind of nice to be on this side of a radio  controversy. 
[00:33:00]  Cause we've watched it so many times, uh, from TV with other talking heads and jackasses  commenting on our fuck ups.  And we just don't really care about TV cause we could have been the go-to guys.  Oh yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Remember we blew up our spot.  Remember the, uh, the water incident.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  And they got both of us on the phone and we just completely fucked up the interview on  purpose.  Yeah.  We just figured we'd have fun and fuck around.  Could E-Rock find that?  And that's the reason why they don't call us every time a jog messes up. 
[00:33:30]  We thought it was hilarious at the time, but that was the last time they actually called  us to be the experts on, on a radio story.  I forgot what we were doing.  It was, it was really condescending and, and, and stupid.  Yeah.  And it was Allison who was a friend of ours.  Right, right.  Allison Stewart.  Allison Stewart.  Sure.  It's, uh, fuck it, man.  I forgot what I was going to say about Jamie Fox, um, getting in trouble. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  God damn it.  I had a thought, you don't have a thought, just leave in mid, in mid mouth.  I don't even think he's in trouble.  He's getting, he's getting some nice, he's getting some nice headlines and that'll be  it.  That'll be it on this.  Yeah.  He might have to, if someone pushes, he might have to, uh, comment on this.  The thing is, and the point, one point I didn't get to was, uh, the fact that he,  we are looked at as dopey shock jocks.  And when we say something stupid, oh, look at what they did again.  They said something stupid.  We, we still get in trouble for it.  Mind you.  Right.  Right.  But he's an Oscar winning actor who is saying this shit. 
[00:34:30]  Uh, so I think he's going to catch a little more flack than we would.  What did he say?  It's expected of it.  Uh, just talking about Miley Cyrus and, and how apparently she wanted to get backstage to  see Radiohead and, uh, they wouldn't meet with her.  And she got angry.  She got angry about that.  Radiohead's like that.  Gush bags.  Whatever.  And, uh, so they were talking about that.  Yeah.  And they were like, you know, screw her. 
[00:35:00]  Wait, can I, uh, Miley Cyrus, who is she anyway?  She, she, she, she's the one with the big gums.  And then they talked about that.  And I believe somebody did say, uh, uh, little white bitch.  I respect Radiohead for going, who gives a shit?  We don't want Miley Cyrus backstage.  I mean, Cyrus.  Just because she's Miley Cyrus.  Yeah.  I have, I have, I have respect for that.  They're just being douchebag.  Like, you know what I mean?  It's like, she's a fellow artist.  She wants to say hello, leave her alone.  What's the problem?  They're too cool for her.  That's, that's what annoys me.  That, that, that too cool for the room shit.  Um, but you know what's funny? 
[00:35:30]  Jamie Foxx, if he had played a guy raping her in a movie, there would be no issues about  it.  Because there's still this, of course not, you'd be jerking off.  I wish they had a worse rating.  The, uh, but it's this fucking, once again, it's this phony morality around comedy and  jokes.  If he played a guy raping her, they'd be like that.  Jamie Foxx, what a performance.  And Miley Cyrus.  She was, but because it's comedy, people want to throw in their outrage and it's phony.  What he said was fine.  It was a hundred percent fine. 
[00:36:00]  Public figure.  Yes.  He went off on it.  She's an innocent girl.  Who gives a shit?  It was funny.  Innocent girl.  The picture that was just up on the internet there that Danny had up was, oof.  She's not innocent.  She's got a sexy side to her.  And she acts way older than she is.  Yeah.  And her father allows it.  Yep.  Because, you know, they're raking in the dough.  They're connected at the hip, those two, too.  It's a little creepy.  They're making money on both ends.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Her as a young girl and her as an older girl. 
[00:36:30]  Look at her.  She's pulling her shirt up with her teeth just below her breast.  A little chubby for a 16, 17-year-old.  That's baby chub, dude.  A little baby chub.  Baby chub.  Nothing wrong with that.  It either goes away or it gets bigger.  You've got to watch that.  Okay, here.  This is worth playing.  We haven't played this in a long time.  Watch my cherry rock.  You're getting the Jamie Foxx clip?  Yeah.  Look at her on her little pink sheets.  Where?  You're missing the...  What a creep.  You're missing the pics, Jim.  Oh, look. 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  That's outrageous.  That's good.  She's got little Hello Kitty sheets.  Mmm.  Look at that.  I see Nip.  Do I see Nip?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Through the shirt?  No, you don't.  Yeah.  Through the shirt?  Oh, yeah.  See?  And they're going off talking about her?  Look.  She might be all innocent and everything in her little movies that everyone loves taking  their kids to, but you wait.  She hits that 18 mark.  There's going to be problems for...  She's still not 18.  Billy Ray.  She's 16. 
[00:37:30]  That's insane.  Yeah.  She hosted an awards show.  You'd do that, right?  I'm just saying.  So, anyway.  Of course.  She's in the shower in that one.  She's showering in a long t-shirt.  Who did...  Holy mother of Christ.  Who took that picture?  Billy Ray Cyrus?  Probably.  Who took that picture?  He's a sick fuck.  There's a weird relationship going on there.  Who did she send those pictures to?  Jimmy Norton?  I think it was one of the Jonas Brothers or something. 
[00:38:00]  Really?  Yeah, she was dating one of those guys for a while.  Get out of here.  I'm so jealous.  Yeah, those guys are hot.  I know.  She got bored with those guys because, you know, they got the promise rings.  Promise ring.  There's another ring that Jimmy totes around with him that I think she wanted a little more.  I got to play this.  So, remember the radio show that killed the broad with the water drinking contest?  Water drinking contest until the woman dies contest.  So, because we've been in trouble over the years, you know, they're always searching us out to be the experts. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  That's us.  And they got Ant and I on MSNBC, and this was the last time we were called.  The last time.  I don't even remember what we said or did.  Because we just blew it up.  We decided to be complete a-holes.  You know what it was?  We actually had a talk about this, too, before we went on.  We're like, should we be?  I go, do you really want to be the guys?  When every guy we've watched that has been in radio has commented on our situation, we always look at the TV and go, fuck this asshole. 
[00:39:00]  Who are you to, you know, talk about our situation, pontificate, holier-than-thou attitude kind of a thing.  It's like, screw you.  So, before we made the call, we were like, let's just totally douche this interview.  And be idiots and ruin it.  And this is how it went down.  And that's what we did.  Oh, yeah.  Haven't been called since.  Openie and Anthony are nationally syndicated radio hosts, also on XM Satellite Radio, two of the best known in the business. 
[00:39:30]  They're joining us now on the phone.  Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.  Thanks for having us, Allison.  Hey, Opie, so as two people who do provocative radio for a living,  what did you think when you first heard this story about this woman dying from drinking that much water during this stunt?  Well, obviously, I feel bad for Jennifer and her family.  But I also feel bad for the show because they're just kind of a wacky morning show.  They're not really shock jocks or edgy.  They were just kind of having a little fun. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, kind of fun.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I feel bad.  Anthony, what did you think when you first heard this?  It was awful.  You know, these poor kids of the mother are going to be asked for the rest of their life, you know,  how would your parents die, you know, or your parents die,  and they're going to have to come up with this ridiculous story of, you know, a radio stunt.  I forgot.  Ed decided to do Steve lines.  Yes.  Now I remember.  I was trying to get in as many Steve lines as possible. 
[00:40:30]  That's when we were playing Steve lines.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How did your parents' parents die?  I forgot that's what I was – that's the tack I was taking was trying to get in as many Steve lines.  I think there's a clip where panic sets in.  Allison's like, oh, my God, what are these guys doing to me?  Yeah, I was listening to you guys this morning, and one of the – you played a clip from this show,  and one of the guys was like, hey, she signed a release.  Does that – she signed a release excuse hold, in your opinion? 
[00:41:00]  No, I think legally it might hold, but – so they don't get arrested.  But I think civil – a civil case will be brought up.  And it reminds me – it was a case years ago, back in 83, a couple of disc jockeys.  I think it was Ramon and Frankis in the morning.  They had a staff member shove marshmallows in his mouth, and he choked wearing a bunny suit.  It was awful tragic.  The Nagel family's never recovered from that.  And, you know, I remember they were taken right off the air. 
[00:41:30]  What an asshole.  It was so obvious that you had all these facts.  Ramon and Frankis, and you knew it was the Nagel family.  You knew the outfit.  And it's back in the 80s.  Yeah, in the 80s, 83.  The Nagel family.  It was very funny.  This was all based on stuff we were doing on the show, obviously, at the time.  At the time, yeah.  Oh, man.  Eric was doing the chubby bunny in the bunny suit.  We are tools.  And then finally.  So, Opie, do you think this is going to bring any industry-wide changes, or is this just going to be one of these – 
[00:42:00]  I got to, like, defend myself here because you're going to hear me just be like,  because I can't believe Anthony's doing what he's doing.  And I'm laughing in my head so effing hard.  I heard you.  And I was caught off guard.  I didn't even – this is what happened.  I was laughing so hard in my head, and I was covering my cell phone that I didn't know what she asked me.  And I knew I had to say something.  I heard you going, like, a couple of times while I was doing it. 
[00:42:30]  I heard you laughing.  And then I realized, yeah, I'm going to be like, oh, my God, Opie doesn't know what he was just asking.  So you're about to hear me just start talking because I knew I had to say something.  Or is this just going to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines eventually?  No, I think the boss is going to, you know, kind of pretty much wreck it for everybody else.  I mean, the bosses in radio in general are beyond scared as it is.  And now that we officially have killed the listener out there, yeah, I think you're going to hear a lot of really, really boring radio. 
[00:43:00]  No one's going to really try to go to the edge or do anything edgy.  Well, Anthony, didn't management maybe say, hey, did you talk to a doctor about this or something and maybe get some confirmation if this is dangerous or not?  So, Anthony, you're throwing it up the food chain a little bit, that management maybe should get involved and maybe should be held accountable.  Yeah, maybe you say, you know, did you talk to a doctor about this or something, you know. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe management should have looked into this and seen if it was a little more dangerous than they thought.  Opie and Anthony, we really thank you for taking the time to be with us today.  A couple of assholes.  Thank you, Allison.  Thank you.  Allison.  That's funny.  Oh, what a douche.  You made a good recovery, though.  You started stammering, but then your point was fine with the radio.  Yeah, well, because I was like, yeah, whatever.  She used to be a friend of ours.  We haven't heard from her since.  That was an old Psycho Mark reference there. 
[00:44:00]  Did you talk to your doctor?  Oh, Allison.  I think I know her at Fox, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's friends with Mike.  She used to work at MTV.  Yeah.  What's her last name?  Stuart.  I might know her.  She might be friends with my friend, Elizabeth.  I think I've actually been to her apartment, if it's the one I'm thinking of.  Whoa.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, not for that type of stuff.  Oh.  A cafe latte?  Yes.  Yes.  She has a little mocha.  She's a cafe latte.  Oh, is she black?  Pretty girl.  There she is.  Yeah.  No, she's kind of...  She's...  Oh, no, that's not her. 
[00:44:30]  I'm sorry.  That's not her.  That's not her?  No.  Different Alice.  You weren't in that...  You weren't in her apartment.  No, no.  It was...  Testifying that you were not in her apartment.  I was not in her apartment.  Pictures?  No.  We have a hair.  Fiber sample.  Alice.  All right.  We got the Jamie Foxx clip.  Oh, finally.  Yes.  So this is what Jamie Foxx said on his show, and then Hannity was doing a little something  on this last night.  A little something.  Did y'all hear what that bitch said?  Not to call the little girl a bitch.  Let me slow down. 
[00:45:00]  Who?  Hey, it's Foxx.  Do you?  Do you?  It's Foxx.  Oh, we don't give a shit.  We're all going to hell.  Who's a bitch?  Yeah.  She had the nerve to fucking put the...  Put down Radiohead because they didn't want to meet her punk ass at the Grammys.  Who we talking about?  Who we talking about?  Miley Cyrus.  Who is Miley Cyrus?  Hello, white bitch.  You watch.  Can I ask you a question?  Who's...  Which one is Jamie Foxx?  Is he on the phone?  No.  No.  Is he phoning in his own show?  I think he's the one with the loudest mic.  Oh, okay.  Can you rewind that a little bit?  Because I have no problem with it. 
[00:45:30]  The guy even caught himself.  I don't want to call the little girl a bitch.  It's like, yeah, who cares?  Punk ass at the Grammys.  Who we talking about?  Who we talking about?  Miley Cyrus.  Who is Miley Cyrus?  Hello, white bitch.  You watch.  The one with all the gums?  Yeah, the hand on the table.  She got to get a gum transplant.  She's my boy.  She's light on...  Bubble yum gum.  Light on teeth, heavy on the gums.  Shit.  Let me get an order of mouth, light on teeth, heavy on the gums.  So she said she didn't want a what now? 
[00:46:00]  She wanted to meet Radiohead before their performance at the Grammys and they told her to fuck off because they're real musicians and they got to do their shit.  So she said she was going to ruin their career.  She's going to ruin Radiohead's career?  The same Radiohead that gets paid a million dollars just to sample their song?  Yes.  That Radiohead?  Is Miley Cyrus a million?  Is she Hannah Montana?  Miley Cyrus?  Yeah, she's a Hannah Montana, girl.  Oh, come on, bitch.  Don't make a sex tape.  Yeah, make a sex tape and grow up.  Get like Britney Spears and do some heroin. 
[00:46:30]  That way I'll do like Lindsay Lohan and start seeing a lesbian and get some crack in your pipe.  So we can start respecting you as an artist.  Catch chlamydia on a bicycle seat.  That's what I want.  Oh, we back, baby.  I'm back.  And bring that back to Disney.  Shut up, Priya.  It's another episode of Smell My Finger.  I'm back.  Wow.  But I miss, I got no problem with that, but I miss saying nappy-headed hoes was outrageous.  I know, exactly.  It's almost like they should say what they said because it's a comedy show. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  But how come no one is saying to that girl, why did you call her, if I said that little  white bitch, that little black bitch, oh wow, that kid from the Cosby Show, who is that  little black bitch?  What's her name?  People would be fucking angry.  I would be like, what?  Why would you say little black bitch?  Why would you say that?  That's a race.  You're using race to identify her.  Oh my God.  I'm calling her a bitch.  But I wish I had addressed that point on Hannity.  Yeah.  See, the problem is not, well I will when I'm on in June if you're still talking about it.  Or on Red Eye tonight when I'm on.  Oh!  See, the problem is not the radio show. 
[00:47:30]  It's not Jamie Foxx.  It's not the woman who said that because they're being funny.  They should say what they said.  It's just simply the phony outrage of people on the outside.  They're the problem.  Not the radio show.  If you forget anything on Red Eye, I'll take care of it next week when I'm on.  They're actually cancelling your appearance.  Shut up!  In order to get me tonight, because Ann Coulter wanted to do it, and I said I'll do it.  But as long as Kumi is not on within three weeks.  Because he's just going to repeat what I said, even if it's not the right topic.  We just start dicking each other with these Fox shows.  Well, that wouldn't last very long.  Believe me, I think I'd be getting dicked everywhere. 
[00:48:00]  No!  Anthony's coming.  You stay home.  Jimmy is a charm to have on those programs.  The word they use is delight, but if you want to use charm.  Let's go to Hannity and talk about that clip we just heard.  All right.  Now, you hear you.  They get fired, and then they come back.  So they take a vacation, and then they come back.  You don't have the greatest track record here.  I've got to tell you, it's really nice to be on this side of the story.  What do you think?  But, yeah, I'd be a hypocrite if I sat here and said that he should be fired.  I absolutely don't think he should be. 
[00:48:30]  It's a comedy show.  He's on there.  He's going off about somebody with a bunch of friends in the studio.  You're running off with your mouth off the cuff.  You're going to say things that are going to upset people.  The only problem I had with it was the fact that if Don Imus can get fired for saying what he said,  then what protects Jamie Foxx from using a racial epithet in what he said?  But it's so weird.  The way they beep it, you think he said it, but she said it.  But you know what? 
[00:49:00]  We've learned it doesn't matter who's in the fucking room.  We had a homeless guy.  We literally had a homeless man dragged him in off the street because he was hysterically funny because he's just out of his mind.  And he went off on a rant about the Secretary of State, about the Queen of England, and about the First Lady.  We didn't say a word about it.  And we got suspended.  From satellite.  From satellite radio.  It was a black guy saying things about white people, and yet they still took the racial angle because you're a white guy and you were commenting on Condoleezza Rice. 
[00:49:30]  Condoleezza Rice.  That was the big problem.  And they suspended us.  30 days.  The idiots at XM, who I think everybody involved in that suspension, is fired and gone now anyway.  Ha ha!  We win again!  That fucking homeless Charlie guy.  We want him back.  He's a scream.  What a boot!  That guy is a funny dude, man. 
[00:50:00]  I don't care.  He's one of those guys.  He just sat down and was just...  And people, of course, you couldn't see it on radio, but he was smiling because he knows he's making people laugh.  He was smooth.  He's like, ah, shit.  Who cares?  What he's saying is hysterically funny.  And what about that Bush bitch?  He made me fucking laugh.  He was a funny dude, and he had good comedy instincts, and that was such garbage.  You know he's never been seen since?  Oh.  You think a black van pulled up and threw a man and screamed away in the night?  We haven't seen him since.  He is homeless. 
[00:50:30]  And finally, this from Hannity.  If they want to sit around in their living room and have a chat and they think it's really funny,  and I'm just horrified that there's women in the background laughing about it.  Why?  Especially on content that isn't federally regulated like satellite radio.  You can get away with saying things like that.  The part is the double standard in...  When I'm on the air, I don't worry about cursing or saying things like that because it's satellite.  I walk on eggshells about racial issues, though.  Because even on satellite, that's going to get me in trouble. 
[00:51:00]  But the thing is, is Al Sharpton going to do the same thing to Jamie Foxx?  Yeah.  No.  Right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Is Al Sharpton that he did to Don Imus?  He'd be smart, too.  He's not going to do shit.  No one's going to say anything.  I'm sorry, Ann.  Who is she White House press secretary for?  Bush.  Okay, so it's an interesting point.  This is, again, how phony, and this is why people should shut the fuck up.  I can't believe there are women laughing.  Really?  Well, there's a lot of women that can't believe you're press secretary for a guy who's against  abortion or against abortion.  Right, right.  So it's like, shut up.  It's whatever it is, right? 
[00:51:30]  It's fucking annoying.  Ugh.  Sorry.  No, no.  It's my language, I mean.  Oh, okay.  And there you go.  Our first hour in the books.  Ooh.  We'll take a quick break.  All righty.  We've got to get into the Hulk Hogan thing.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Shit.  Wow.  Hulk is angry.  Oh, boy.  We'll explain next.  This ain't no work.  He's really angry.  And the Bruce Springsteen might have had an affair story has some legs, huh?  Bruce might have had an affair. 
[00:52:00]  We've got a Springsteen station here at Sirius.  Are they covering this?  Yeah, right.  Well, they said they mentioned it, but they just don't know.  They're not going to bash the guy, but they don't know details.  Because her mother's denying him some shit.  He does have a past history of shenanigans, let's say.  He's a rock star.  I would hope so.  Shenanigans.  He should put his dick everywhere.  Yeah.  Guy's been fucking doing up and putting out hits since, what, 74?  Stick it anywhere, Bruce.  Who cares?  If you're married to Bruce Springsteen, wherever his dick goes, you go. 
[00:52:30]  If it's fucking in somebody else, you wipe it off when he comes home.  Hey, this is from Born in the USA, and the residuals are still rolling in off that album.  The rule should be for every hit, he gets a new girl.  Yes.  Simple as that.  Or at least a new hole.  Right.  He wants the mouth, he gets the mouth.  He wants the hiney, he gets the hiney.  He has to call it hiney, because it's not vulgar.  Hiney.  The alleged girl is a younger version of his wife, too.  She looks like a younger version of Bruce's wife.  Dude, that is what has been happening with him over the years.  He kind of gets other versions of, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Remember the one he used to be with?  The original.  She was so effing hot.  There was some redhead he was with.  He blew her off for his wife.  There was some redhead he was with that was in like a Bad Company video or something.  No, no.  She was in a, what was one of the spinoffs of Rossington Collins or the other one?  The one that had more hits.  Oh, I don't know.  To be honest with you.  Oh, oh, oh.  Da-da-da-da.  Now I'll just look down at this until someone answers me. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, if you're thinking.  Off of Skinner?  Yeah.  Skinner had Rossington Collins, and then they had...  Wow, I don't know.  The other one that had more hits.  Ronnie Van Zandt?  What are you talking about?  I don't know if there was another spinoff from that band.  You sure?  Well, there was 38 Special.  38 Special!  They didn't really...  That's not a spinoff.  I thought they were.  No, there's another brother.  Well, kick me in the patootie.  There's a Van Zandt in 38 Special. 
[00:54:00]  There is?  Yeah.  And is he a brother of somebody?  Oh, okay.  That must have been where I aired.  Ted Van Zandt?  Ted Van Zandt?  Why?  Hang on loosely if you so choose.  Oh, hold on loosely.  And I think that was the song.  She was in the video.  All right, we got to find that.  The red-headed bitch.  Yep, there she is.  And then he was with her for a very short period of time, and then he took off with his backup  singer.  Bruce?  Yeah.  And married her.  Atta boy.  Yeah.  That's the one I'm thinking of.  Julianna Phillips. 
[00:54:30]  That's the one, yeah.  She was really hot.  Yeah.  She's got that 80s look.  She's got the weird 80s hair.  Yeah, she's definitely 80s'd out.  So take that out of the equation.  Isn't this woman like a 40-something-year-old nurse?  Who?  The one who he's supposedly banging out from the gym in Jersey?  Isn't that the one?  I didn't read it yet.  Well, from the gym in Jersey.  Yeah, we'll read the article next.  Hulk Hogan and the Bruce Springsteen story next.  And some bowling before 8.15.  Come on.  Yeah, oh my goodness.  We got to get the bowling in.  Oh, the pins are set up.  Wow, that's really far. 
[00:55:00]  That is longer than any bowling alley I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Come on.  Like they make bowling alleys of different lengths.  Isn't it a standard length?  That's longer than any bowling alley I've ever seen.  I've been in a lot.  How many of you have been in maybe, what, seven?  Yes.  In your life?  And I've never seen it that long.  All right, we're going to do some bowling next.  We're going to get the mic set outside the studio.  Where's the pitch hips?  Stay there.  Stay there. </pre>
