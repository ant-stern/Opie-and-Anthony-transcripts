<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a Trim Spa sponsor read featuring race car driver Joe McCarthy.  The majority of the show was dominated by the fallout from an on-air incident involving a regular caller, "Stalker Patty," where Opie forcefully removed her wig.  Listeners reacted with extreme outrage and profanity, both condemning and defending the hosts' actions in numerous phone calls and emails.  The show also featured a gleeful discussion of a televised car chase ending in the suspect's fatal crash, further fueling listener anger.  Throughout this segment, music, including a song about a missing wig, was played, and the hosts previewed a future airing of the "Stalker Patty" segment.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of their recent softball game, with New York City radio personality Scott Perel in studio providing a highly vulgar and detailed account of listener behavior, including excessive drinking and crude incidents.  Perel also discussed his career frustrations.  This was followed by a phone conversation with Pat Croce, former Philadelphia 76ers executive, about the Lakers-Nets NBA finals.  The segment continued with a lengthy, offensive impersonation of Mike Tyson, filled with homophobic slurs and sexually explicit language, focusing on Tyson's recent hug with a gay rights activist.  Numerous commercials aired throughout this portion, including for Tweeter, Ultra Carb, the New Jersey Lottery, adult entertainment stores, Hotwire, Sam Ash, American Same Day Service, Budweiser, Captain Morgan, Priceline.com, LendingTree.com, Venom energy drink, Consolidated Credit Counseling Services, Stackers fat burner, CBSMarketWatch.com, and Old Bridge Township Raceway Park.

Mike Tyson then appeared as a guest in studio, engaging in sexually explicit and vulgar jokes, boasting about his penis, and graphically describing his sexual encounters. He also promoted a fictional "Mike Tyson gay man's sex line." After Tyson's departure, the hosts previewed and then played an audio recording of their "brutal" and "messy" confrontation with Stalker Patty.  This involved aggressive berating, insults regarding her appearance, and culminated in her tearful dismissal from the show and building.  The hosts framed this as a business decision based on ratings.  This segment was interspersed with "F.U." messages from listeners, and commercials for concert tickets, Rolling Rock Town Fair, Venom energy drink, Robin's Diamonds, the Lewis vs. Tyson fight, the SeeClearly method, American Same Day Service, and Sam Ash, as well as a television show called *Boston 24-7*.

The following segment consisted of numerous commercials for Venom energy drink, Dr. Pepper, Guinness, Snap-on Tools drag races, the MTV Movie Awards, Tweeter electronics, Payroll Data, Mercedes-Benz, Worldwide Stereo, a charity basketball game featuring the Philadelphia Eagles, Stacker 2, Barnaby's, and the Red Cross.  The non-commercial portions focused on listener reaction to the Stalker Patty incident, with callers expressing varying degrees of outrage, amusement, and regret. The hosts addressed the controversy with a defiant and humorous tone, discussing the "cringe" factor and the risks of their radio style.  The conversation also touched upon the show's ratings and the potential loss of listeners, as well as past controversial segments and a listener's claim that another person slept with Anthony's wife; another caller made sexually suggestive comments towards the hosts; one host claimed he was only "brutal" for 20 seconds during the Patty incident, a statement disputed by his co-host.

Finally, the show concluded with a rapid-fire sequence of commercials for The Inn of the Dove, Consolidated Credit Counseling Services, Dial-a-Mattress, the DeWalt Million Dollar Challenge, and the Lewis vs. Tyson pay-per-view boxing, followed by the "What Did We Learn?" segment. This segment featured listener calls recounting cringe-worthy past experiences with show guests, strippers, a dominatrix, and observations about Gary Coleman, Mike Tyson's perceived Ebonics, and a supposed use of Mike Tyson's genitals as an engine part.  The segment also included listener anecdotes about wigs, bullying, and various absurd and shocking events. The broadcast ended with station promotion and more advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Nigel Huffington reminding you to drink responsibly.  Hey, what's up? Once again, it's Cabby, and you're not going to believe who I have on the phone.  Don't know who you are, Joe.  Hey, Cabby, it's Joe McCarthy. I drive the 41 Busch Car for the Busch North Series and the Trim Spa Racing Team.  This guy's a race car driver, and you're taking Trim Spa, right, Joe?  Yeah, I've been taking Trim Spa for a month now, and I needed something to get me in shape for the upcoming season,  and I've got to tell you, it makes me feel awesome, and it's just all around improving our race team.  It's a high-speed diet pill for a high-speed, fast car driver.  I tell you what, if we can get around the racetrack as quick as we burn fat, we'll have a real good season. 
[00:00:30]  Man, I'll tell you what. Now, you had a race this past weekend, and you finished, what, eighth?  Yeah, we finished eighth position out of 30 cars, and it's a great way to start the season off.  See, people? 1-800-TRIM-SPA, or go to the website, www.trimspot.com,  and you can lose weight, just like Joe and the thousands of millions of trillions of other people  who go to the website, www.trimspot.com, or they call them up.

[00:02:00]  I'm used to the crazy people. 
[00:02:30]  Psycho.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mental?  No, it's our show!  I'm a mad man!  I'm getting pissed!  You sound like a stalk-raving mad person.  No!  I'm getting pissed!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  The O.B. and Anthony Show.

Why the f*** do you have to do that to Stalker Patty, man?  So what if she's poor?  And f*** you too, Ben, you mother f***er.  You know you want to kick her out of the show?  Kick her off, but you don't have to f***ing take her wig off.  What the f*** wrong with you, dickhead?  Come on, man.  That's really pissed me off.  You guys are a bunch of f***ing douchebags.

This is a big F.U. up to O.B. and Anthony for the f***ing stunt that you guys played today with Stalker Patty.

Next message.  This F.U. goes on to O.B. Anthony and Rick from Christian and Buffalo. 
[00:04:30]  I can't get this dirty feeling out of me when you ripped that wig off of Stalker Patty's head.  I was hiding behind the goddamn couch.  I was so ashamed.  I couldn't even go and turn the channel.  Thank you, guys.  Now I can't sleep at night because I keep hearing that scream in my head.  Go after yourself, you devils.  You're all burning in hell.  End of messages.  Hey, what's new?  Wow. 
[00:05:00]  Wow.  Hi, everyone.  Yumpin' Yemeni.  What the hell is that sound?  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027. 
[00:05:30]  If you're calling from outside of New York, including...  Hell.  866-2774-WOW.  That's 866-2774-WOW.  The phones have exploded, Anthony.  Yes, they have.  Look at Eddie on line 7.  He wants to know if we saw the car chase on Fox.  Oh!  Hey, there you go.  That's a good one to go to.  All right, let's go to that one. 
[00:06:00]  Eddie.  Eddie!  Eddie.  What's going on, fellas?  Was that one of the greatest Fox car chases ever?  Dude, mad kudos to Fox, because they finally showed the jellified body of a dumb mutt who decided to steal a car in Texas.  This guy stole a pickup truck.  He's driving around, and this guy was dangerous right off the top, man.  He was hooking U-turns on, like, major three-lane highways and just going into oncoming traffic, cutting across dirt fields, back onto the highway, off, zigzagging in and out of cars, doing about... 
[00:06:30]  Judging by the speed of the other cars, which he'd be probably doing, if they're in Texas, about 70, this guy was doing at least 90, 95 miles an hour.  He then loses it somehow and steers right into those huge, round cement columns that hold up the overpasses.  All live on fire.  The big highway interchange overpasses.  I was sitting in a room full of cops watching that happen live, and the cheer that erected when this guy hit that friggin' column, it sounded better than when the Giants won the Super Bowl. 
[00:07:00]  Well, I hate it when these things end with them pulling over and pulling the guy out, waiting and waiting and waiting, when they finally get out, and then they cuff him and lead him off.  When this guy hit that thing, our office just went, oh, yeah, yeah, we were applauding.  And then they head on into the pylon going about 90, 95 miles an hour.  Completely accordion the truck.  You're not going to have to worry about going to court for that one.  That one's taken care of.  And then they pull his body out of the truck and cuff him, and he's just laying there. 
[00:07:30]  They cuff his lifeless body.  They cuff his lifeless body.  And then they showed him picking up the guy's body.  And Ken Stevens was in our office at the time.  He goes, I don't think a leg is supposed to do that.  It's supposed to bend like that.  His leg was bent at the shin.  He had an extra knee on.  I think it was his left leg.  And his arms were just kind of hanging, even though they were cuffed.  And they drop him behind the cop car, and he did that dead guy jiggle.  Right. 
[00:08:00]  And that was it.  Game over.  But now they're trying to claim that the guy was okay when they put him in the ambulance.  Oh, stop it.  You're right.  Dead.  There's no way this guy's alive.  Dead.  Dead.  Guy dies on Fox Live today.  Sweet.  All right, Bray, you guys ruin it.  Bye, Mike.  Suck.  Take care.  All right.  I heard he was kicked off of a radio show the day before, and someone pulled his wig  off, and that's what sent him on that little jaunt through Texas.  I'll tell you this much. 
[00:08:30]  Dallas cops, they rock.  They put the L.A. cops to shame.  Yeah, the L.A. cops are a bunch of pussies when it comes to these chases.  I've got to say one thing, though.  At least the L.A. cops chase the cars.  A lot of the states, they've just completely written off giving car chases.  They let the guys go.  I noticed the L.A. police there, though.  Their move is to try to bump the back end of the car sometimes.  Kind of, you know, throw them off course a little bit.  Sometimes.  Dallas.  Yeah.  The Dallas cops go right at them.  They're going.  They open up all barrels of their cars. 
[00:09:00]  They're pulling in front of the car.  It was pretty good.  Very good chase.  Beginning to end.  I give it a nine.  A nine?  I think you have to give it a ten how that ended.  A ten?  You know what?  No.  You're saving the ten for the.  I'm saving the ten for the one.  You don't crash with the minivan with the mom and the kids in the car.  You know what?  You sick F.  You should not be able to do a radio show.  A ten.  Coming from you, that's a compliment.  A ten has to be reserved for when innocent bystanders are also killed.  You heartless.  The guy only took. 
[00:09:30]  The heartless bastard.  He only took himself out.  You're a heartless bastard.  You don't have any humanity in your body.  The T-bone.  The T-bone on the retard short bus is a ten.  Why the hell would you ever want to see that on live TV, you heartless bastard?  Yes, yes.  You tell me.  You tell me.  You have no humanity in your bones.  You disgust me.  As Obie's yelling at the cops on the TV, pull him out!  Pull him out! 
[00:10:00]  I did not do that.  No?  Well, maybe I have you confused with some other horrific thing I was witness to.  Well, I got to tell you.  The email has just been wonderful.  Yeah, it's been great.  Let's go to a couple calls here.  Lou, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Satan?  How are you today?  I just wanted to find out if you'd be physically abusing any retarded children on the show today.  You're the sickest. 
[00:10:30]  I had to bathe after that.  Yeah, I was sick.  That was disgusting.  You're maniacs.  Totally out of control.  Stop being hypocrites.  Scott, what's going on?  Nothing much, guys.  How are you doing?  All right.  I just had to say that was great yesterday.  I've been waiting forever for you guys to do that to her.  Forever.  Oh, to stalk her pattern?  Oh, my God.  She is so annoying.  All these people calling him bitching and moaning.  Oh, I hope she's gone forever.  I've been reading a couple of emails.  Thank you, Scott.  Thank you.  And Jimmy Norton, all of a sudden, it's St. Jim. 
[00:11:00]  St. Jim is what the listeners are saying about Jimmy Norton.  St. Jim.  I don't even know what people are talking about today.  People have pretty much taken me at just, they don't care.  It's, some say I suck, some say, the brunt of the abuse is being focused on you, my friend.  Yeah, Jim.  No, you.  Oh, me. 
[00:11:30]  I'm a sweetie.  You're a fake sweetie, though.  No, I'm not.  I'm a gentleman.  I was not sure if you were carrying in a phone book or yesterday's emails.  What was that heavy, bound?  I carry my awfulness right on my sleeve.  You hide.  No, I have my awful moments.  What were you saying, Ann?  I'm sorry.  I was saying that it looked like you were carrying a phone book, but I do believe that was just the email from yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  Well, yeah, it seems like there's a lot of people that are very, very pissed off.  A little angry.  How the show ended yesterday, and I have at least, what would you say, about a hundred of them here.  Well, I'm just going to say, I don't think everybody knows the whole story.  That's what I'm going to say right now.  We could get into that as the show goes on.  Are we going to try to clear some things up today?  I believe a lot of the people that add things to their emails like wishing cancer on people and wishing horrible death are hypocrites that don't know the entire story. 
[00:12:30]  of Patty and this station and this program.  Well, why don't I just read a couple emails?  Ben is the true scumbag here.  Ben enjoyed that way too much.  I did not enjoy doing that at all.  Cheering on the rape.  Ben was cheering on the rape.  I knew it had to be done, but I wasn't enjoying it.  Ben was partying and celebrating all night. 
[00:13:00]  Fast Freddy, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  That was beautiful.  Good times yesterday, although, you know, you've got nothing to explain.  Hey, Ed, there you go.  I'm not explaining.  Two people thought we did the right thing.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, man.  You know, nothing, man.  She deserved it.  Time to get all the life.  There's no explanation here.  Cut the fat.  I'm just saying, anybody that emailed that said, because of yesterday's show, they're no longer listening, F off.  Well, Keith wants to ask you something, Anthony.  Yes, Keith? 
[00:13:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Just wondering, Anthony, are you still going to be saying none on us when Patty throws herself underneath the magnifying glass?  None on us.  Hey, one last thing.  I could have sworn in the background, I heard someone yelling, Patty, put your goddamn wig back on.  All right, I'm punching that.  I'll tell you this much.  I guess people thought the wig thing was going a little too far.  It seems like most of our listeners were okay with everything.  Yeah.  Most of them. 
[00:14:00]  I'm not kidding.  Oh, of course.  Until the wig thing.  And that's what put it over the top, or just thousands of our listeners.  Thousands.  I wish Louis Black was here to see the look on your face when he was screaming out, grab the wig!  It was take the wig.  Take the wig!  I don't know.  I wasn't listening.  If you remember, I punched out halfway through it.  Anyway, let's see.  This is a guy named S. 
[00:14:30]  Subject.  What the hell?  Today's show was so wrong, I cannot believe it.  After today, I'm not sure I could listen again.  Meaning yesterday, of course.  What the hell?  I don't get how anyone can be so utterly cruel for someone who is that pathetic, that hopeless.  I was actually happy at first when you said this was it for Patty.  I thought she was annoying and kind of groaned any time she came on the show.  But that just went beyond anything that was necessary, to cut the ties like that.  I can understand the escorting out of the building, the restraining order, all necessary to get the point across that this was it for her. 
[00:15:00]  But to take her wig!  Yeah.  Oh my God, to hear her scream and cry like that, it was awful.  The woman has nothing, and you managed to strip her of the one thing that maybe she had, a shred of her dignity, her wig.  Opie, that was so wrong.  Jesus, what kind of a person can do that?  What kind of sadistic, dark soul are you?  I love listening to the show.  I set my alarm so I can listen in the afternoon.  I find much of what you do pretty effing hilarious.  But this?  You really did this? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  This wasn't just talk.  You really did this to this woman.  Opie, get some help.  S.  He sets his alarm to get up at three, and what's he do for a living?  I don't know.  Now you get the hell out of here!  Wow, that was harsh, Opie.  Hey, can you get me out of this one?  Like old times' sake?  Sorry, Opie.  Can't do it.  My father assured him that either his signature or his wig would be on the contract. 
[00:16:00]  And I hope your first wig is a masculine wig.  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, it was the best wig I ever had, and I've had them all over the world.  They took that wig to make me look ridiculous.  Anthony.  All right.  Big F you to all the bastard, unloyal fans of ONA.  Number one, almost every time Patty would come on, they'd come on bitching about how they hoped that she died and that she wished that she was never on the show. 
[00:16:30]  And now they start bitching to Opie about how they miss her.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  I don't know if your call is going to help me today, but thank you.  What are you going to do?  Walk up to her, grab a wig, pull it off her head, bada-bing!  What does he want?  Bada-beep, bada-boop, bada-beep, bada-boop.  He wants the wig back.  Hey, open up my vest.  There's a wig.  Who's the sick bastard now? 
[00:17:00]  Chris, what's up?  The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world his name was Opie.  Nice.  Thank you, Chris.  Bye, guys.  He's wearing wigs two at a time.  Slap my brother's wig off.  Kevin.  Yo.  What's up?  I just want to say, getting rid of Stucker Patty was like taking old Yeller out back and 
[00:17:30]  shooting him, except no one cared.  All right.  Thank you.  People are, I guess they're okay with what happened yesterday, Anthony.  Ed, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  It was just wrong, Opie.  I mean, I'm a fan.  I listen to every show every day.  I'm in my car every day.  You know, I understand he wanted to get rid of it.  It seemed like he came out of nowhere.  Yeah.  And then Anthony was just going along, and Norton was totally uncomfortable.  You know, that did come out of nowhere.  It really did.  It seemed that way.  Of course it did. 
[00:18:00]  But just everything was fine.  I mean, he wanted to get rid of her and all.  It was kind of funny and all, but she got really upset and grabbing the wig, man.  That was just, I have, you know, I argue with my wife and stuff about you guys.  I love the show, and I'm arguing with my wife and other women about, you know, defending  you guys.  I can't defend that.  You know, I just didn't think she was going to react like that.  Well, come on.  You know her.  I mean, she's stupid enough to get her stuff in this situation.  There's a part on the tape we were listening to in the back office.  I thought she was laughing.  It sounded that way, yeah, but I don't think so. 
[00:18:30]  I think she's just a maniac.  It did sound like laughter, didn't it?  Yeah, it did.  I think she's just insane.  All right, Ed.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Steve just handed me this.  I don't even know what this is.  All right.  New from O&A Films, the story of a mentally ill vagabond dog without a home.  Daddy!  I want to be your friends.  I don't want to lose contact with anybody.  We're not your friends.  We're going to have to cut your loose panties. 
[00:19:00]  Forced to sleep in hallways and closets.  Her life was one major disappointment after another.  I mean, how many times can we shave your head?  I don't want to lose anybody.  You don't have anybody.  Desperate for attention, she wouldn't go away.  Patty was living here, didn't ask anyone's permission.  No matter how harsh the abuse.  Take the wig!  Please, please.  Take the wig!  Don't do it, please.  I don't want anyone to see me.  I can't go to work like this.  You'll laugh.  You'll cry. 
[00:19:30]  You'll want to strangle this annoying derelict.  Patty!  We have no use for you anymore.  Bye-bye.  Oh, Jesus.  What the hell, man?  Jeez, Steve.  It's a little harsh.  Thanks, Steve.  That'll help our cause today.  Corey writes, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just some of the email coming in today.  That was, at the same time, the highest and lowest this show has ever gone.  I was laughing like a bastard and cringing for the whole 20 minutes. 
[00:20:00]  Holy mother of God, you're both going to hell, and I'm going to be there with you for laughing at it.  Opie, you're a cold bastard, but I want you to know that you did the right thing.  That obnoxious broad was dragging down the whole show.  Now you just need to drag the retard Laverne and Shirley around Manhattan behind a truck.  Crinkle, Crinkle, you guys suck.  Corey.  Wow.  You want to read one of these, Ann?  Read this.  Oh, let me read.  Just pick one at random.  All right.  Let me give a little read here.  We'll never get to all of them. 
[00:20:30]  There's hundreds.  Ladies?  Calling us ladies?  Well, because it was a...  Brian.  It wasn't a manly thing that we did.  Oh.  After hearing today's show, I felt compelled to write to you.  No one enjoyed hearing that Patty would no longer be welcome on the show more than me.  She has been a bore since the first time I heard her after your show began airing in Philly last year.  I thought you might have been a little rough since she seemed really hurt by two individuals that she considered to be her friends, 
[00:21:00]  whether you consider her a friend or not.  But I still wanted her gone.  And then, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, the wig.  After she began crying on the streets of New York City, I began feeling sorry for her.  Then when you persisted in trampling on her poor misguided mind by ripping the wig off her head, I realized that you had gone way too far.  Not being human.  Not being human.  Now, you may not know this, but if you know the way a person feels when they see an innocent dog get killed in a movie by some maniac 
[00:21:30]  and then hope that maniac will be punished twice as badly as the hurt dog, you know the way I feel about the two of you.  If you both were struck down by a bus on the way to work, you, uh, what?  On the way to work, be forced to live out your remaining years of lies in a wheelchair with no use of your arms and legs.  I think that might be punishment enough for the treating of a human being the way you treated Patty.  Thank you, Brian. 
[00:22:00]  Can't tell if he's pulling or against it.  That's a little much.  That's a little harsh.  What type of talk is that?  And if you remember, I punched out.  I tapped out of the bit.  I tapped out.  I said I reached my limit.  Replay the bit.  Opie, after I tapped out, said to Rick...  I got the tape in front of me.  It's 29 minutes long.  Take the wig!  You tapped out at like 27 minutes.  Look, I tapped out before it went to the level it did. 
[00:22:30]  I don't say I don't agree with what you did, Opie.  The horrible thing you did on the show yesterday.  But I...  When does my bell ring?  I think it's before.  Take the wig!  I don't know.  You did tap out a little late.  I think the wig was in studio and everyone was eating potato salad out of it when you probably  should have had enough.  Come on.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Opie? 
[00:23:00]  I got to side with you on this one.  You did the right damn thing with her.  If a little more people were like you, what you did to her, we wouldn't have these freaks  running around, sucking up our time and money.  It's ridiculous.  You did the right thing.  She's got two choices.  Either run off and put herself in front of a train track or make a better life for herself.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  I'm going to take a nap.  When I come out, if there's a wig on the table, I'll know I have a partner.  If not, I'll know I don't. 
[00:23:30]  I'm not feeling too good about myself today.  That's so funny.  You're not?  It was a tough thing yesterday, you know?  We were going down the tough love route, you know?  I think people need a little more of a background of Patty and this program and the station.  The girl, it's affecting her life.  And we have tried kindly in the past. 
[00:24:00]  Does everyone realize that she started off as our stalker, right?  The first time we ever met her, she was trying to get our home addresses.  Yeah.  From Ben.  Right, Ben?  Yes.  Yeah.  And, you know, we've tried in the past to guide her away from this program a little bit and  get on with her own life.  But she won't do it.  I know.  It has cost her jobs.  Homes.  Homes.  Homes. 
[00:24:30]  I know for a fact.  The brown Audi.  And maybe some of these people will call in today, Anthony.  There's a black wig in my parking spot.  I want to tow it away immediately.  I know for a fact, and hopefully some of these people will call us today.  Listeners of this show that have put her up in hotel rooms.  Yeah.  Nice thing to do.  Listeners of this show that have just handed her money because they feel really sorry for  her because of what they've heard on this show.  Listeners of this show that have offered space in their own homes.  Mm-hmm.  That Patty has said no to because these places were too far from the show and the radio station. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Places in New Jersey.  I know listeners of this radio show that have offered her pretty good paying jobs.  Yes.  It's not great, but better than working part-time at McDonald's because it's right down the  block and it's close to the station.  Yeah.  But these jobs also in the New Jersey area, too far from you and I and the radio station.  So we're the victims here?  And then it gets to the point where she has decided she's going to live at the radio station 
[00:25:30]  and no one sees where this is not okay.  She was living under our stairs.  Where does pulling the wig off her head come in?  Hey, man.  Just go with it.  I'm trying.  That goddamn wig really makes me laugh.  Travis from South Jersey, Opie, saying that the clip of her yesterday sounded like that  poor little man fly caught in the web at the end of the original movie, The Fly.  Help me. 
[00:26:00]  Help me.  Get my wig off.  He'd throw the rock on her head.  Hey, everybody play on the house.  The dancers will kick your wig off.  Draw wigs for everybody.  You guys are sick.  Look at you making light of a very serious situation.  I just love the Godfather.  You guys are awful.  The Godfather, the wig father references.  See, something snapped in my head yesterday.  I realize that now, today, I've had a whole night to think about it.  I know it's wrong. 
[00:26:30]  You guys are taking it to the next level.  You sick bastards.  But you had to straighten your wig first.  Stop.  Stop.  Godfather.  I need that wig.  Stop.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Man, it seems to be 50-50.  I at least am trying to work my way out of this.  Yeah.  Kathleen writes, Dear Opie and Anthony,  Come on, guys.  What you did to Stalker Patty was beyond cruel. 
[00:27:00]  If you want to break her loose, fine.  But did you have to do it on the day before her birthday?  Oh, that's right.  We had no idea.  Oh, that's right.  It's Patty's birthday today.  It's her birthday.  Tough love, fine.  Maybe she does need to concentrate on her life more.  But you shave her head at the game, then dump her?  You guys had this all planned.  You disgust me.  But the absolute cruelest thing you did was have her wig snatched off her head.  See? 
[00:27:30]  People were almost okay with it.  I know.  Guys, that was horrible.  My heart aches for her.  How could you devastate her in total disregard for her feelings, her dignity?  Hasn't she been through enough garbage in her life?  Self-imposed or not, you are the cruelest, the meanest, the most abusive scumbag a-holes.  How would you feel if Patty ended up committing suicide?  That is a real possibility, you know.  You guys and all the people on your show and all the others at the station were the only family she has ever known.  You should be ashamed of yourselves, to put it mildly.  You should be fired for demanding that your flunky rip that wig right off Patty's head. 
[00:28:00]  If Boston thought you were bad for the April Fool's prank and fired your sorry asses,  New York should fire you and hang you by your yam bags.  Make it right, Opie and Anthony, or you have lost me and a whole bunch of my friends and co-workers as listeners.  If I could contact Patty, I would, and I'd buy her the best wig she could ever want.  The biggest, bestest wig.  She needs more than a great wig.  Could you buy her a lobotomy?  Leave the wig.  Take the cannolis.  We got her new feet. 
[00:28:30]  Right!  We got the woman new feet.  Johnny Fontaine never gets that wig.  It's perfect for her.  Just think of all the things we've done for her.  You were right about one thing.  She'll be better off without you bunch of pathetic losers who get their kicks out of abusing the less fortunate.  Disgusted with you, Kathleen.  Shut up.  Get a hold of yourself, would you, Kathleen?  Shut up.  Here, Jim, read this one.  Oh, Kate from Jersey is calling you Adolph Hughes. 
[00:29:00]  I'll read an email.  Just don't, you know, read out the curses.  Opie and Anthony, I recently began listening to your show about a month ago.  Ooh, good sign.  And I admit that I have found much of your show hilarious.  Since the ratings and what is good for the show seems to be your main concern,  I just wanted to let you know that I will not be listening to your show any longer.  Oh, no.  Nor will I ever listen to any program on WNEW or frequent any of the sponsors affiliated with your program or the station. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, boy.  Now we did it.  If you don't want Paddy to be a part of your program, that is your prerogative.  But to publicly humiliate another human being for your entertainment is effing sick.  Your behavior is sociopathic.  This time you went too far.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't entertaining.  It wasn't good radio.  F you and your miserable, pathetic, impotent lives,  and you need to humiliate others to feel good about yourselves.  Sophia.  And then P.S.  Who the hell knew that Norton would be the only one with an effing conscience?  See, Norton comes out of this thing looking like a saint. 
[00:30:00]  I am a sweetie.  What can I say?  Stop it.  I'm what you'd call a little doll.  You are not.  I do think that this person really needs to get a hold of themselves, though.  I will never pass over WNEW again.  I will never say the letters W.  All right.  I know.  I'll never buy a product.  Ah, so we made a mistake.  Oh.  What does we know?  What is that?  We might have made a mistake.  I don't know.  It happens when you do this type of thing.  Right, Ann?  Sometimes.  I don't even know if we made a mistake. 
[00:30:30]  Uh-oh.  Well, you sound like you're a backpedaler.  I don't know what to say today.  Gene, what's up?  Yeah, I'm not going to cut that shock open and watch that Kipner kid's wig spill out all  over the dock.  Hey, one more thing.  Yes, Gene.  Hey, Charlie.  Charlie, they took my wig.  Norton.  That was nice, sir.  That was nice.  Go ahead, baby.  What's that wig?  Oh, boy.  Amy, are you going to yell at us, too?  Absolutely not.  All right. 
[00:31:00]  What's up, Amy?  You have not made a mistake.  People need to realize that Patty was a stalker.  She still is a stalker.  She is one step above the shopping cart pushing aluminum can collecting mentally ill community,  which is wrong.  Everything is wrong with this city.  She needs psychological help.  She doesn't need to hang out at a radio station all day.  She's sucking the life out of the community.  All right.  Sucking the life out of the community.  Thank you, Amy.  Sucking the life.  Hey, I found a positive email. 
[00:31:30]  You did?  Yes, I found one.  Bravo.  Let's see what this guy has to say.  All righty.  Oh, my.  Opie and Anthony, you effers are cold.  That was the meanest, nastiest, rudest thing I've ever heard on the radio.  As an act of purest optimism, I have put up with a lot of garbage while listening to various  shows in the hopes that one day I would hear something that effing funny.  The dumb bitch had to go.  I only wish I could have seen that in person so I could bounce Lugers off her bald ass head.  What the hell did she expect? 
[00:32:00]  How long are you supposed to let her sleep on the damn couch?  She got her money and she was shown the door.  Damn, that is good radio.  From this point on, I shall go forth into the world seeking every radio that I could find.  I will set them to tune in our local D.C. area O&A station and rip off the damn knobs.  You are now my heroes.  Wow.  And then he writes, today you finally edged out that wacko who swiped the tank and proceeded  to drive over everything he could in California.  And if she ever comes back, nail her feet to her forehead and roll her the F on down the road. 
[00:32:30]  Asmo.  Nice.  Michael, we're bigger than U.S. wigs.  Well, that was positive.  That was a good one, right?  That's a nice one.  Here, I want you, here's one for you.  A positive?  Ah, no, that was the only positive.  Oh, damn it.  And he sounded a little deranged himself.  All right.  Why don't you read that one there?  All righty, here we go.  If you wanted ratings, why didn't you just beat the S out of the poor homeless woman and take her purse? 
[00:33:00]  It would have received better ratings than publicly humiliating her.  Former Opie and Anthony fan.  Uh-oh.  Who would know this would be the one?  This would be the one that turns all of our listeners against us.  This was the one.  Luca.  Godfathers, on this, the day of Patty's de-wigging, may her new wig be a masculine wig.  Hey, listen, guys.  I've seen these de-wiggings all the time. 
[00:33:30]  And Johnny Oli used to take this.  Take care, guys.  Have a great day.  Johnny Oli.  I've got to tell you, I think the listeners are very torn right now, Anthony.  Of course.  They're very torn.  I didn't know they were going to snatch your wig, Mike.  They're very torn.  What to do?  What to do?  Dan, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Whoop.  Whoop.  She sucked, man. 
[00:34:00]  She lived underneath your stairs.  Give me a break.  And I think it was the greatest thing.  With the de-wigging and everything.  The de-wigging.  Oh, making.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  No problem.  Bye.  That's a handsome wig, Mr. Gass.  Norton, why don't you read this one?  All righty.  Norton, read that one.  I was passing around the room today.  This is from Daisy.  I still love you guys, but really, you should have just let her keep the wig. 
[00:34:30]  I will hear her shrieking, hysterical cries in my nightmares tonight.  Daisy from Sacramento.  So I would say that is pro.  Yeah, that is pretty bad.  That's a good one, yes.  Yeah, the wig thing was the thing.  You know what it reminded me of, too?  I was just watching this the other night.  Oh, God damn.  You know, we would have never pulled the wig off.  We just weren't getting the reaction we needed yesterday.  I was watching Silence of the Lambs.  And when the girl's in the pit and she starts screaming.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  And the guy up at the top is like,  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I felt like I wanted to do that when Patty was screaming.  Ah!  Yeah, it was pretty uncomfortable.  Oh!  It was uncomfortable for everyone.  Ah!  He's just trying to be her.  He's trying to learn how to be her.  Yeah, he made little boobs with his hands on his shirt.  You effed me hard.  Jane, gum.  You want to eff me?  I want to eff me.  John, what's up?  She's a great big fan person. 
[00:35:30]  I have to agree with the masses.  I think it was a little cruel what you did to Patty.  Yeah.  What you should have done was just taken her to the diner and left her at a counter like  her mother did.  Yeah, this all happened outside a diner last night.  I forgot about that.  All right.  So she had flashbacks.  It's partially her fault.  If she would have gotten a Maury wig, Maury wigs never come off at the wrong time.  You jump in the pool with it.  It takes the wig off its head.  It does this whenever it's told. 
[00:36:00]  Did the rancher make you perform play show?  Did he de-wig you?  Did he de-wig you or de-same?  Hey, Opie, you sea-sucking faggot.  Oh, wow.  You suck, a-hole.  I used to be a fan, but after Monday I threw my wow sticker out and will never, ever listen  to your show ever again.  Treating people like that, you should be beaten with a bag of oranges.  Let's hope you get paralyzed soon, you sea-sucker.  I can smell your wig. 
[00:36:30]  Why don't you throw your wow sticker out and deprive yourself of being flack?  That's cutting off your nose to spike your face.  That's what my dad used to say.  Matt, what's up?  You guys acted appropriately.  You needed something that severe to get her the hell out of your lives.  But if you think she's gone, you're nuts.  She's going to come back.  But I did think it was harsh enough.  I think if Rick had rubbed his yam bag on top of her bald head, maybe she should have gotten 
[00:37:00]  the picture.  It's time for someone else to take care of her.  Right.  Exactly.  You needed something that severe to get.  Otherwise, she would have come back to return the wig.  And two weeks from now, just as another excuse to come by the station.  Do you guys understand that she is living at the station?  Yeah.  She sleeps here.  She bathes here.  Because she will not do things that take her away from the, what, two block radius of  this station.  If she gets a good job offer, she won't take it. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  Because it'll interfere with her time she can spend here.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, I don't think everybody, you know, really understands.  Maybe we need to play the bit again before 520.  Funny you should say that today, Mike.  Wow.  Coming up at 5 o'clock on the Opie and Anthony show today, just in case you missed it yesterday,  Starker Patty's tough love segment.  Excellent.  All right, Mike.  All right.  5 o'clock today. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  You can decide for yourself.  It's a sad old day just picking up the wig and tussling it.  Give it a little tussle.  Well, it's, it's really, um, well, the instant feedback is just awful, Opie.  I know it is.  Look at how many.  It's just awful.  There's got to be, I don't know, hundreds of them already that Ben has printed out.  They're just, like, coming in like crazy.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Um, I don't know.  Uh, dear Opie and Anthony, I'm an occasional listener of your show and one who is not easily 
[00:38:30]  offended, but you have done a terrible injustice to an innocent and pathetic individual.  I wouldn't be surprised if this woman commits suicide as a result of your treatment.  I hope for your sakes that this was a prefabricated effort, a la Andy Kaufman versus The Wrestler,  because if not, you have shown utter contempt for the feelings and psyche of a weak and vulnerable  person.  Your actions in this, quote, bit were offensive in a way that your other material is not.  This woman is not your typical call-in listener or a guest whom you could mess with. 
[00:39:00]  Those people all have enough sense of self-worth to take a joke and roll with the punches.  This is a naive, depressed person who obviously has little in her life and is reliant on your  ongoing relationship with her.  One that you initiated yourselves, which is so true.  I hope I'm wrong, but you may have single-handedly, uh, led her to disaster.  Single-handedly.  How about that?  There's one for you. 
[00:39:30]  I can read this one.  They just keep coming in.  Oh!  Guys, I've been a listener for a little over three years and never felt the need to give  an opinion.  That was too harsh with Patty.  Getting rid of her would have been fine.  I agree she has worn out her welcome, but taking back the wig was too much.  See, Opie?  The wig.  It all comes down to the wig.  We didn't know.  I've never felt so awful about enjoying something so evil.  Hope you guys left her with something off the air, like the dignity she found in wearing 
[00:40:00]  old lady snatch hair on her misshapen head.  That tough love line Opie kept giving was complete bull-ass.  He loves being a brick.  Norton was brilliant as usual.  I usually J it every Monday night, but I'm just not in the mood.  Thanks for ruining my evening's activities.  Andrew from Belmore.  Open answer.  That was effing fab what you did to Patty yesterday, and he did right fab. 
[00:40:30]  The sheer genius of Opie making them take the wig off Patty and sending her on her way.  Un-effing real.  Best radio ever.  You sick bastards rule.  Not even Darth Vader can match the evil that lives in Opie.  Darth Vader?  Come on.  John, what's going on?  John?  Yeah.  What's up, John?  I just wanted to give you guys a hip-hip-a-ray, hip-hip-a-ray, hip-hip-a-ray.  Thank God that C is gone. 
[00:41:00]  You guys better stick to your guns and not let her back.  You guys are very divided today.  Here's Wendy from Dallas, Anthony.  You make me sick.  Y'all shouldn't have done Patty like that.  I mean, it's all right to let her go and tell her bye, but she, did you get it off on it?  My opinion, you're ridiculous and sad, but all you care about is your ratings.  I do.  But anyways, just wanted to let you all know y'all are some a-holes, especially Norton.  Well, how did I get lumped in as especially stupid? 
[00:41:30]  Y'all had such a good show about the goddamn softball game, then you had to do Patty like that.  Y'all are some crude mother effers.  Wendy.  Mmm.  Yeah.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  Give me back my wick 
[00:42:00]  Honey, now let your head go, boy  Give me back my way  Honey, now let your head go, boy  It'll have nothing  Honey, fine, you know where you're going  Taking me downtown 
[00:42:30]  It's going for the night  When I get down there, I go  Honey, now, now you're dead  Give me back my way  Honey, now let your head go, boy  Well  It'll have nothing  Honey, fine, you know where you're going  Then my mama told me  And your good friend, too 
[00:43:00]  When you get that wig out the wig  You just wanna do your job  Give me back my way  Give me back my way  Honey, now let your head go, boy  It'll have nothing  Honey, fine, you know where you're going �� oneself  Save us  Save us  Let's see 
[00:43:30]  Save us  against them  Program  We're going to definitely  Save you  If you have any  If you are to let yourself  Or leave them  Save you  Save us  Save us  Save us  Save us  Save us  Save us  Save you  Save us  Save us  Nice jam.  Who found this? 
[00:44:00]  Earl.  This is Hound Dog Taylor.  Give me back my wig.  Earl with the assist of the day.  One more time.  Goodbye, little one.  All I've got to say.  Give me back my wig.  Oh, I know every way you did.  Give me back my wig.  Honey, now let your head go on. 
[00:44:30]  Woo!  Well, have no been.  Honey, bye, you know where you're going.  Ah!  There you go. 
[00:45:00]  Ah, that's pretty good.  That is a great song, Earl.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Patty, what's the matter with you?  Never let anyone outside the family see you without your wig again.  You rule, Mort.  Thanks.  Later.  Think about Patty.  She's got lifeless eyes. 
[00:45:30]  Black eyes like a doll's eyes.  When she comes at you, she doesn't even seem to be living.  Until you pull her wig off.  I suck.  God, I...  Pugger wig off.  You were so there, too.  Ah.  You were so there.  Don't you have to pug a wig off?  Shut up.  You were so there.  Can it go on, eh, wig?  So excited I had it.  Louis.  I don't know what's funnier.  Or Opie feigning regret for what he did when we all know he's smiling and laughing his ass off. 
[00:46:00]  Or having that loser walk out of the studio and having to relinquish that rat on top of her head.  Well, we like to push buttons here.  We like to challenge you guys to see where your own personal line is.  Dudes, I've been listening since almost day one, and nothing you do shocks me.  See?  We like to see what makes you cringe.  Yeah, well, the only thing that makes you...  How far would you take it?  The only thing that makes me cringe is that annoying, stalker voice every damn day.  All right, Louis.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye, Angel. 
[00:46:30]  Bye.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  We have a dolphin that's raping scuba divers.  Yeah, it was actually on CNN, wasn't it?  CNN.com.  How about that?  It's got to be real.  Sure.  And Mike Tyson with that hug thing.  We've still got to get to that today, Anthony.  He's homo-friendly.  And more of your hate email.  Lots of it coming in today.  And maybe we can scrape together that clip.  What clip?  Of Patty.  Oh, that's right at 5 o'clock.  Oh, is that a... 
[00:47:00]  I'm not even going to sugarcoat that today.  In all its ugliness, you'll hear it for yourself at 5 o'clock.  Yeah.  Beth, I thought I was having a bad day until I tuned into your show.  I know Patty needs help, but could you at least have had a hat or something for her  to wear after you took her wig?  A hat!  Beth, go down to the police at Crown Zero.  They'll give you a hat.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, look what I do now.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, you want the wig?  I gots the cheddar.  I can pay to rank.  For a great deal.  All right.  He's a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.  Hope you like crap.  Extreme.  Extreme.  The 94 WISP Extreme Team.

[01:00:30]  Right.  It's a piece of ugly radio, that's for sure, right?  It certainly is.  But right now in the studio, our buddy, our pal, he does mornings here in New York City.  Take it in.  Take it in.  He helped us out with our O&A softball game on Saturday.  The rally.  Oh, yeah.  He was the star of the show, without a doubt, Saturday.  What a blast.  It's Scott Perel, man.  Hey, man.  How you doing, man?  Boys, that was, I said it today, I know no one gets up in the morning that likes to drink  and smoke, but for the people that didn't hear it, I swear to God, on my mother's grave, 
[01:01:00]  God rest her piano playing ass, that that was the greatest day in 19 years of radio I've  ever had around anybody.  I think your softball rally was the greatest day for me.  I have never felt, I said it before, and I'll say it again, to be cheesy, that was the coolest  I've ever felt about myself, about my life, about my audience, your audience, didn't matter.  I've never felt warmer, I've never felt, I was stunned, I sat in a limo afterwards with 
[01:01:30]  people, this hot chick and a couple other people I know, and I was all just like going,  that blew me away.  I've never, I've never felt better about my life than I, leaving, honestly, I just don't  care that much about radio to give a crap about anybody or any show, and I said it today  on the air, that you guys have the coolest following I've ever seen, and it was so neat  the way they treated me, that that's what it made me whip, did you see the guy hitting  the head with a, I broke his nose with a beer can? 
[01:02:00]  And he was totally cool with it.  And he was cool, he goes, Lawrence Farrell did it, and that's what, that's what epitome  of what I'm talking about.  You pretty much knocked his nose off his face.  I was acting like an idiot, and I felt good about it, I was grabbing my package out at  first base, I had umpires kicking dirt on me, as I called them, dildo lips.  You made the show, bro.  Dude, it was so easy.  You made the game, by calling and doing the play-by-play for everybody, because there  was lots of lulls in the action, and you kept it interesting for everybody.  Hell yeah.  I filmed a movie afterwards in a parking lot, I smoked like a thousand joints, and filmed 
[01:02:30]  the movie, and it was just the greatest.  The audience that you have is a sick, demented, twisted, torqued, foul, disgusting, repulsive,  I love them, I want to make love to them.  In fact, when somebody said that you were considering doing it somewhere else, like in  statin cancer, or in somewhere, I said that I want to be there, for sure.  We want to do another one before the end of the summer.  Yeah.  My goal is to be there, at the very least, I've heard a lot of people talk about doing 
[01:03:00]  things, but if you do it, I want to be there next year, for sure, and that would mean I'd  have to keep my job.  Yeah, we want you to keep the job, bro.  Well, Monday, I decided not to come to work, based on negotiations.  You know, I negotiate every day with myself at 4.59, whether or not to come in, and I  decided not to come in, and I said, no, today, in the name of O&A, I will sleep, and I will  rest my voice, because it was thrashed.  Believe it or not, we're pulling for you.  Dude, I want to do well, and it's real simple, man.  You guys have made the difference for me, and I mean that. 
[01:03:30]  You guys have made the difference, because I don't, look, they don't spend a nickel on  me, and that's all there is to it, and they don't do anything for me, except give me  the job, and give me the opportunity and the chance.  I don't have billboards and buses like all these other guys on radio.  Christ, I saw one for Hannity so big on the New Jersey freeway, I told my limo driver to  wreck just for the sake of wrecking for the size of the billboard.  They spend so much money on these dildos, and I told them the other day, I said, don't  ever spend a nickel on me, ever, because I'm going to do it with O&A and word of mouth. 
[01:04:00]  Like you had to tell them.  These people are going to hate me.  Believe me.  I said to them one day, I said, in July, if you don't renegotiate with me, I'm going  to do you, and I said, in October, if I get to October and you haven't done it, I'm going  to do you from behind.  I said, in December, I'm going to leave.  And you know what the guy said to me?  Shut up.  You got a foul mouth.  I said, you're fat and ugly.  I don't care what you think of me.  Dude, I came here.  I'm a vagabond.  I live in a hotel.  You used to live in a hotel. 
[01:04:30]  I see your office.  It's filled with all your stuff.  Yeah, I know.  I think you're living in your office.  Patty was living under the stairs.  Patty is the train to Auschwitz, dude.  You guys just did her.  That harsh haircut you left the other day with like a little horse rain on the back.  Yeah, we left her a little.  What's wrong with her, man?  She's really wonka.  Can you imagine her showing up for that chocolate job looking like a freak?  I mean, she looks like a razor nightmare.  Somebody did her.  She's addicted to this station.  She has an addiction to this radio station and the people that work here. 
[01:05:00]  How about those two fat whores that were falling down in the pool?  Oh, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Hey, listen.  That was the most fat whore.  Winging around in the urine pool.  And then Tracy Morgan.  How'd you like the urine pool, Tracy?  How about when he was out in a second?  I go, show your crevasse.  And he did.  Yeah, he was showing.  And he was just covered in urine.  Walking into the dugout.  I mean, the best part of the day was when you whipped the mic and I go, they landed in  the urine. 
[01:05:30]  How about the McCarty chick?  How about the mush ball, racked, pale, I'm from Ohio looking skank that she was.  Remember the blonde that was this pale?  With the big, huge rack, right?  She had the biggest, she had like freaking watermelon-sized hogs.  Yeah, yeah.  And she was jiggling them.  And I kept yelling, you're a skank, you Ohio living whore, you.  And then that, do you remember?  Oh, my God, they score.  You're a smash.  I love that, dude.  You're so smashed, man.  You're terrific. 
[01:06:00]  I just found out he comes here for happy hour.  Happy hour.  I have, I just, I've had one beer.  Now listen, this is me normal.  I come in every day for happy hour.  I have a couple of buds out of your cooler.  I don't bug anybody.  I say hi to my boy Rossi.  But how about the teabag stories today on the air?  Have you seen the pictures?  We have pictures of the teabag and up on foundrymusic.com.  That guy told me he'd be unsquirreled.  It made me laugh so hard this morning.  I swear to God, I had a flap fart, you know, when you're talking and you get a little burner.  And I also had a snot shift.  From like 98, I felt like a wall of my nose go, snot shift. 
[01:06:30]  I was laughing so hard.  I've had so much fun.  Did you see the picture, though?  No.  Oh, dude.  I've had so much fun with your softball rally that, honest to God, that I'm now going to go see Norton.  I want to laugh more.  See, I don't laugh.  I'm a prick.  I get into arguments.  I am mean.  I'm the guy in line that says, you know, Pharrell, you, you bitch.  I'm the dude that just hates everybody.  You've got to have more fun, man.  You guys make me laugh so hard.  Your show is so disgusting. 
[01:07:00]  And I swear to God, I'm coming to see you.  I'm going to sit alone and I'm going to drink scotch and I'm just going to make noise.  Dude, slow down.  I honestly...  You're making us all nervous.  Slow down.  I am.  Take a breath.  The teabag picture is on Foundry Music.  It's a guy.  He's passed out, right?  He's got his hat on backwards.  The guy is resting his mule on the brim of the hat.  And his yam bag is hitting the back of the guy's neck.  He's just resting his sack on the guy's neck. 
[01:07:30]  Now listen...  Hold on, hold on.  And they're putting up new pictures all the time from the softball game up on foundrymusic.com.  And the first batch of videos are now up.  Is that your own private website, the Foundry Music thing?  Yeah.  What is Foundry?  We get to put all the dirty stuff there.  Oh, yeah.  I see it.  The R-rated stuff.  Now, our website blows, but it's changing now.  I heard it's finally getting better.  They changed, like, the colors or something.  No, they changed the look, but you still can't put the cans on there.  Now listen, I wanted to...  Before I forget, because I have Pharrell Alzheimer's.  It's where I just...  One minute I'm about to say something, and I'm like, ah, I don't remember. 
[01:08:00]  It was foul.  I didn't want to say it.  I'm going to Cleveland.  Oh, you are?  I'm going to Cleveland, so we've got to just plan ahead that you can send me in there to  get killed by your audience, because you know I've done them before.  I'm going to that stink hole of a foulness for July 12th through the 14th.  I'm going.  I'm staying at the Embassy Suites in downtown Cleveland.  I'm going with the Yankees to the Indians on another great road trip.  I'm going to party.  I'm going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I'm going to have a Pharrell barbecue at the Jake, and I'm just going to drink and stink  and think, and I'm having two happy hour, two hour open bar bashes. 
[01:08:30]  I want to invite everybody in Cleveland on July 12th, 13th, and 14th, particularly Friday  and Saturday night, to come get just lacquered, just hammered with me to just hate me.  I want to have a Pharrell hate party.  You are going to have a few people, man.  I've never been on in Cleveland, so I want them to just despise my girth.  Well, call our show when it gets closer.  Really fast, what do you think, Nets or Lakers?  Dude, you know I'm a Laker fan.  I lived in Lipstick City forever, and you cannot stop the diesel. 
[01:09:00]  I took the Lakers and the over on this game Sunday, hit both.  That'll pay the rent this week.  But I'm rooting for the Nets.  I think they win game one because the Lakers got a little king fetish going.  It's like having a two-day Ria, and they've got to get rid of that Ria, and then they'll  go back to work.  I think they're going to get the hangover buzz and lose game one.  Nets win game one, and I think the Red Wings are going to beat the Hurricanes.  Hey, you know, I heard that they're going to race the Indy 500 again, and they still  won't be done with hockey.  That's like a year from now. 
[01:09:30]  How about playing hockey in July?  What's wrong with the NHL?  We're heading toward that.  Hold on a sec.  Pat Croce, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Anthony, everybody.  You've got Scott Farrell in here, too.  Hey, Anthony, I could hear Scott.  I'd love to see that movie that he filmed in the parking lot with all those J's.  What happened was he was driving home, and there was about 1,000 of our listeners  walking out of the stadium after this crazy softball game we did Saturday.  He jumped out of his car and started just blazing.  He's the only guy that could do what he does besides me on NBC.  Dude, when I saw you the other day before one of those games doing a live shot, I think 
[01:10:00]  he was in, I don't know where you were.  I was in Boston.  I was in Boston for game three, and I saw those fans turn cars up and down that 30.6  game that I saw.  I was sitting in a luxury box.  I have never seen anybody have so much fun doing the NBA as you, and I envisioned me.  I said to somebody, I was in a bar.  I said, that's the only guy that could act as twisted and pharrelled as me, and I want  that job.  I want that guy's job.  I want to kill him.  I wanted to kill you because you were having so much fun. 
[01:10:30]  Croce, you're the only real person in the league.  If everybody looked like David Stern, they'd all be in law classes.  You're a badass.  You're sick in the hat.  I love you.  I used to be in Philadelphia.  You got a bunch of pussies there.  They couldn't handle me, but God bless you.  You're a bitch.  Wow.  I take that as a compliment, Scott, man.  Wow.  I mean it, dude.  You're good.  You got the life.  You know what?  You have so much energy, dude.  You're what life's all about.  You're the coolest dude.  You should have never given up that team.  Now, Pat, you're talking to a lot of Net fans right now.  What do you think?  I would like to see Jason Kidd and the boys do it, but I don't think so.  Oh, boy. 
[01:11:00]  You know, you got to tell the truth.  I mean, as Scott said, this Jack Diesel, he's unstoppable.  I love Todd McCullough.  You kidding me?  Todd McCullough is my buddy.  I would love to see Todd do well, but I don't see anyone stopping that dominating force in the paint.  No one.  He scored 76 points and 30 rebounds in the last two games himself.  That's how you win.  And did you see McCullough do the Humane Society with a little – he's got a – did anyone see my dog, dark green, about six inches tall with a strawberry blonde fall?  There's a picture of Todd McCullough with a little dog of the Humane Society. 
[01:11:30]  Nobody in New York even knows who it is.  They're like, it's some gay guy with red hair.  He's got a dog.  And I love it.  A guy that –  Hey, Scott, you would love that guy.  The guy wakeboards, he bungee jumps, he repels.  You know, you're rowdy.  You know how I get around town, Pat?  I get around Manhattan.  I consider cabs, waves, and I ride Opie's scooter up and down 8th Avenue.  I'm a whore for the – I'm a surfer.  I'm a skateboarder.  And I love breaking my elbows and ankles.  I love injuries.  I love workman's comp. 
[01:12:00]  I love you.  All right, all right.  I'm out of here, guys.  Good to see you.  All right, there you go.  Thank you, man.  Check him out.  He does the morning show here in New York for us.  Billy's the bag.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  We love Scott Farrell.  There he goes.  He's doing a great job for us.  Razor rollerboards for us.  For the station, I should say.  And, of course, we love the Ron and Fez as well.  Now, O&A, did he come in after happy hour, or is that normal?  He comes here for happy hour.  Wow, man.  He's juiced up.  Hey, Pat, he's just getting started.  The guy's the real deal. 
[01:12:30]  He's got some great energy.  I noticed another hand truck full of beer that made it to our office.  And the whole pre-show that we do before the show in our office when we're supposed to be prepping,  it was spent with one of the interns just clanging beer bottles to fill up the fridge.  All we heard all day.  Clang, clang, clang.  That's our show for us.  That's your theme song.  And then Farrell comes in and pilfers some of our beer.  Yeah, Pat, we have a crazy, crazy working atmosphere around here. 
[01:13:00]  I see when you're on the road.  That atmosphere that follows you is more like a circus.  Yeah, we're bringing the show to Boston this weekend, so.  Good for you.  They need some smiling faces.  I was so disappointed in the Kings.  I thought they had it.  They gave it away.  They missed 14 free throws, oh?  I know.  They ran out.  They gave it away.  It looked like Doug Christie had money on the game.  Yeah, he threw up pretty much that air ball at the end there.  I want to ask Anthony.  Did you see any of that game?  Oh, good question.  Pat, I was. 
[01:13:30]  Hold on, Anthony.  What could you tell us about the Lakers-King series?  Yeah, tell us anything you saw in the seven games.  Oh, they played seven?  Well, you know, I was really getting in shape for the softball game, so I wasn't able to  watch much.  Okay, but you saw something, right?  So you got elbow tendonitis then.  What I saw was, well, Pat, nothing.  I did not see even a highlight on TV, on the news. 
[01:14:00]  I didn't see anything.  What do you think of Mike Bibby's performance, Anthony?  The guy can perform, is what I think.  Bibby?  Yeah.  Yeah, Mike Bibby.  Mike, oh, yeah.  Oh, Mike Bibby.  Henry's son.  Oh.  Henry Bibby's son.  I was just going to say that, but what team did Henry Bibby play for?  Oh, my God.  Henry Bibby.  You know, we all remember him from, you know.  All the family.  The ABA.  It was amazing, him and that team. 
[01:14:30]  He was a Nick.  He was a Nick for a while.  Yeah, well, of course.  I thought when I, I'm in New York right now, so when I said that team, I meant, you know,  the home team.  That's what I mean.  And I'll try to make it sound like I don't know.  Who's going to win it all?  Nets or Lakers, eh?  They're playing, right?  And why?  And why?  What?  I think the Lakers, because you've got to go with the big guy.  The big guy?  Okay.  That's as good as mine.  That's good.  If the NBC can hire you next now.  There we go.  I'm in. 
[01:15:00]  What do I know?  I don't know.  Pat, you're doing a great job.  Thanks, though.  You bring a lot of energy to the telecast.  I only got one more weekend.  I'll be doing it this Sunday for the pregame show, because out in L.A. they don't have a pregame  show, so I'm maxed.  But this is it.  This is all we wrote, and so hopefully it's a great sha-la-la.  Hey, that's why I was calling you out to see if you wanted to go.  Oh.  Yeah, you promised that you would fly me to L.A. for the finals.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'll cross you across the bridge. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, to Jersey?  Hey, a pair of tickets to the finals is a pair of tickets.  That's true.  I can do that on my own.  Oh.  I'm thinking you had the pull to get me to L.A.  Well, you know, if you can get out to L.A., I'll make a call for you.  I love it.  I know.  All kidding aside, I would love to go to the finals in New Jersey.  Would love.  You want to go this Sunday?  Sunday we can, because we're going to Boston for the River Raiders.  Oh, look at you now, picking and choosing.  Okay, let me know.  Let me just play the game until you're back.  Let me know off the air, then what game you want to go to. 
[01:16:00]  I'll make the call for you.  All right, cool.  Mr. Croce?  Yo.  What do you think?  Why is Shaquille shooting a free throw so much better now?  Is that my man?  Jim Norton.  Yo, old man.  How are you, sir?  I'm doing great.  Why is Shaq finally making free throws?  What's he doing better?  He smells the jewelry.  Yeah.  The jewelry's right around the corner.  That bling-bling is the only one that you cannot buy.  You got to earn, and he's got to earn at the free throw line, so he's right in it.  How about that?  How about him making that?  You can't even do hack a Shaq anymore, because he's going to score.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:16:30]  Thanks, Jim.  Well, I wanted to know.  He's making his free throws.  That's a big story.  He is?  Yeah, Mr. Croce and I wanted to discuss it, and I told you.  And you guys did.  It was nice.  Yeah.  So you're telling me you had Scott Froehler and the Wildman in the same studio at the  same time?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Ooh.  We're crazy.  Ooh.  Jimmy, I didn't even hear you talk.  I was just...  You guys were talking.  I try not to interrupt.  I don't think Jimmy's a big sports fan there, Pat.  I am a sports fan.  I just, you know, I'm talking about Pat Croce and Pharrell.  What am I going to add?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm worse than Ed. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  No, you're not, because you actually say things.  Hey, Pat, help me out.  The NBA logo, right?  Right.  Jerry West, right?  Right.  There you go.  Someone said it was Havelcheck.  No, it's Jerry West.  Yeah.  I told you.  Shut up, Jim.  All right, Pat.  We'll see you soon, okay?  Okay.  Anthony, Jimmy, take care, buddy.  Take it easy, Pat.  There he goes.  Pat Croce.  All right.  What a good guy.  Nicest guy on earth.  He just seemed like a nice guy.  You know what a savage beating he could give someone?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Guy's like a karate man.  Yeah.  It would just be awful.  Kick ass.  He's all svelte and karateed out.  He would really give you a savage.  Those guys, I could see him maybe in a bar.  He's smiling, having fun.  Fans coming up, talking to them.  That one jackass that's got to get in his face and stop mouthing off.  He'll, you know, smile and blow it up just as long as it takes, and then when push comes  to shove, just put his heel up the guy's nostril.  The guy touches him like three o'clock high. 
[01:18:00]  I remember that.  Touches his shoulder.  Philly's getting very pissed at us because Henry Bibby also played for the Sixers, Anthony.  I was going to say that before you interrupted me.  Kathleen, what's up?  What do I know?  Kathleen?  All right.  Hello.  Okay, Anthony, if people are just tuning in, we're going to replay the Stalker Patty thing  from yesterday.  Oh, great.  Great.  In 45 minutes from right now.  You tell me when you hear it if it doesn't sound like she's laughing at some point in 
[01:18:30]  between her horrific screams and cries.  I thought I heard chuckling.  It was a little bit.  Was there some chuckling?  She was kind of like into the vibe of it.  Yeah.  Like, you silly geese.  Well, we'll do it at five o'clock.  It's a brutal radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really brutal.  All right.  And when we come back, you wanted to finally talk about Tyson?

A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-2774.  Wow.  That's 866-2774.  Wow.  Right around 5 o'clock, Anthony.  Yeah.  The audio from yesterday's show. 
[01:34:30]  Late in the show, we invited Stalker Patty into the studio.  And, uh, it wasn't planned, but we went with it and decided to, uh, kick her out the door.  It was really ugly.  We know that by now.  Yeah.  We were trying to do a tough love thing, an intervention.  You don't think it worked well?  I don't know.  Trying to push her into the real world to get, uh, a life.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:35:00]  And now people just completely hate, uh, us.  Mostly me and hate you a little.  Well, and think Norton is just a sweetheart.  Yeah, Norton's the best.  Everyone loves Jimmy.  Because he wasn't, uh, he was just moaning the whole time.  I'm a little angel.  I can't help it.  When Patty's talking, Norton's just going, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And he didn't say anything.  So at 5 o'clock, we'll replay it in case you missed it.  Quick, somebody pinch my little cheruby cheeks. 
[01:35:30]  Cherub.  Give him a little pinch.  Mike Tyson in the news again.  Oh, God, this guy.  Big fight coming up, as we all know by now.  And what a, uh, what a scumbag Don King is.  No news there.  I mean, no big revelation on that one.  Oh, yeah.  He's in the paper today calling, uh, Tyson, uh, Tyson, what, um, uh, poster boy for the  KKK.  For the KKK.  I guess he feels that what, uh, Mike does in public, uh, hurts the black man. 
[01:36:00]  Because it's kind of, you know, a stereotypical behavior.  Things like that.  As opposed to Don King, who, you know, killed somebody.  If I, he should talk.  And he's living quite large off of all the money he made off of money.  Yeah, the only reason he's saying these things now is because he's done using, uh, Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson doesn't work for him anymore.  If I wasn't such a big faggot, I would punch him in the face.  But I've, I've come out of the closet.  Tyson, you're a faggot now? 
[01:36:30]  I don't think that's exactly what I said.  And I sure ain't gonna say it in this forum.  But I think I'm more lenient towards the homos.  I think I'm a little more accepting to the faggot.  I think they want to be called homosexuals.  Butt pirates.  Because I'm more accepting and open to the gay lifestyle.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm getting tired of women.  Their high pitch screams hurt my ears.  So I figure a manly yell might not be as bad when I'm plowing them in the keister. 
[01:37:00]  So you're going gay?  Well, no, all I said was, I'm not homophobic.  So Anthony, who's doing the voice of Mike Tyson right now.  No, I'm not.  I'm just looking on.  He wants everyone to know that Mike Tyson is now going gay.  No, no, no, no.  I'll set the record straight here.  Pick up that megaphone of yours and tell everybody in Tyson's voice.  I don't see a megaphone. 
[01:37:30]  I'll read the story.  Yeah, you'll read it.  I'm just gonna sit here next to Anthony.  So Mike, you're thinking of going gay?  I don't know.  It's a lifestyle I might want to check out.  I think I handled it like the army.  Don't ask, don't tell.  Don't ask what I'm doing to your ass and don't tell the police.  Tyson hugs off accusation.  First, Mike Piazza says he's not gay. 
[01:38:00]  Now, Mike Tyson professes that he wouldn't hate him if he was.  So you like Mike Piazza if he was gay?  He's got a cute butt.  I like his buns.  I'm just talking like if I was a faggot.  But I'm not homophobic.  Homophobic.  R-O-L-A-I-D-S.  Homophobic.  I spell good.  It starts with an H, Mike.  H-O-L-A-I-D-S. 
[01:38:30]  Homophobic.  All right.  To prove it, Tyson got out of his SUV and hugged a demonstrator here yesterday who shouted,  stop homophobia at him.  Tyson's in town to fight heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.  They don't talk about how I got out of the SUV.  How'd you get out of the SUV?  Well, they opened up the tailgate and pulled the big cage out and then set me free in an area that I won't disturb like the dumps.  It's called the Mike Tyson Relocation Program.  They put the collar on me and you should see them all scurry away when they open that door. 
[01:39:00]  But, yeah, I got out of my SUV.  I thought they hit you with the tranquilizer and just waited for it to wear off.  That's what they do first.  But then they put a tattoo on the inside of my lip.  Yeah.  They attach a collar with a radio transmitter around my neck.  And they put a clip thing in my ear.  And I'm all, like, drowsy and they measure how long I am and my cloth, my hands. 
[01:39:30]  And then they put me in there and relocate me so I don't eat the garbage out of the dump and eat little children's.  Lennox Lewis' children's.  I will eat his children's.  Children's.  It's like a lojack they put on me so they can find out where I am if people start dying and getting butt-effed.  What?  They found a pattern.  Look at the pins on the map.  We have 50 people got butt-t over here in this area.  Some children got eaten over here. 
[01:40:00]  And there's some ladies with their esophaguses hanging out their mouths.  Oh, Mike.  I do some damage.  Yes, you do.  We all know that.  Can I finish this little story there, Mike?  Do what the f*** you want.  It's about you, though.  Okay.  When Tyson pulled up to a fitness center, he was greeted by gay rights activists angry at his use of gay slurs.  You've used a lot of gay slurs in the past there, Mike.  Don't use gay.  That's a derogant.  That's a bad word to use for them. 
[01:40:30]  How do you spell bad?  Bad?  Yeah.  P-R-Q.  That's so stupid.  I did not even use a vowel.  Okay.  I'll try again.  R-L-C.  R-L-C?  L is a vowel.  That's the sometimes vowel.  No?  No?  What do I know?  Finish the f***ing story.  Okay. 
[01:41:00]  Here's the gay activists talking now.  I was shouting stop homophobia and holding up my sign, and then he just came up and hugged me and said he wasn't homophobic, said Jim Maynard, vice chairman of Equality Tennessee.  I was totally shocked.  I didn't know he was saying that.  I couldn't understand it with my c*** in his mouth.  Mouth.  M-O-F.  Oh, that was good.  I got that one.  Oh, you were close.  I love the f***s.  They put up a tad more fight than the b***hs do. 
[01:41:30]  They could take a punch better than Robin Givens, and I hit her harder than, oh, man, I punched her f***ing face in.  It was beautiful.  That was the best punch I ever threw.  F-R-E-U.  No, it's not.  I'm getting better at this.  No, you're not.  Homos like to be punching the testicles.  They enjoy it like my tiger.  You're using slurs again, Mike.  Oh, I don't want to use the gun, because I'm not homophobic.  Right, you're not.  I was inoculated against that.  How did I even get inoculated out? 
[01:42:00]  Stop it.  That's ridiculous.  How do you spell inoculated?  Don't make Mike's head explode.  It's very thick.  And what does that mean?  Oh, it's like a shot they give you to keep from being something, and I didn't want to be homophobic.  I am a member of the gay community.  Where do they give you that shot?  In the keister?  They give it to you in the can, and I give it to everybody else by proxy. 
[01:42:30]  Proxy.  I give it to every, oh, sorry.  I give it to everybody else by epoxy.  Epoxy.  Comes in a pump dispenser, and you better pump it, you f***ing f***.  Hey, that's another slur.  Calm down over there.  They know I love them, the homos.  You know what I, you know what's embarrassing about gay love, though?  Because, you know, I've been involved now with the homo community.  You ever, you know, you do it the gay way.  You know what I'm talking about. 
[01:43:00]  And when you take out your mule.  What's the gay way?  You know, the back way.  And then you pull your mule out, and there's something left on it.  You're like a pancreas.  You thought I was going to say, f***, right?  Yes, I did.  See, pancreas is funny.  And that's a funny organ.  Oh, my favorite song.  I like bending over the gay men during this little tune and f***ing them hard. 
[01:43:30]  Pankreas, p***ing, I forget it.  You can dance, you can dance, f***ing them in the behind.  Oh, see that f***.  F*** his f***.  Stick it in his f***. 
[01:44:00]  You might like this song.  I'm going to see Mamma Mia on Broadway.  F*** that bitch is so fun.  Sticking right in between their barn.  F*** that bitch.  Make them suck my f***.  Give him Abba.  All right.  I like Fernando.  That was a good song. 
[01:44:30]  Which one's this?  Oh, I love this one.  Woo, look at me dancing with my big paws in the air.  I mean, hands.  Woo, I'm f***ing man.  Hallelujah, I'm f***ing man.  In the f*** hole, I'm f***ing man.  Ha, ha, we're your weather girl. 
[01:45:00]  Ha, ha.  And shut up, b***h.  The gay community, since I come out of the closet and figure I'm going to be f***ing a lot of men,  they have dubbed me even more harmful to them than AIDS.  Well, because I'm so big.  Right, that one didn't work.  Ha, ha, ha.  Body, body, body.  I'm checking out Mike's body.  Body, baby.  Such a trail, my body.  Thrill, my body. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Gonna f*** you with my body.  Baby.  Gonna f*** you with my body.  Body, body.  Yeah.  Every man wants to be like Mike Tyson.  F***ing everybody.  Thrill, my body.  All right, enough of this song.  All right.  I'm tired of the gay songs.  But yeah, I accept the homos now.  Can I finish here?  I'll finish on you.  No, that's okay.  We're here.  We're queer.  I'll f*** you and bite your ear. 
[01:46:00]  I didn't find nothing that rhymed with that too quickly.  I understand.  The befuddled activist added.  Befuddled?  Do you know what befuddled means?  It means you're a sucker.  Because he's a f***ing faggot.  That's another slur, Mike.  But I'm being nice.  I told him I hugged him.  You've turned the corner.  You don't do the slurs anymore.  I hugged him and I whispered sweet nothings in his ear.  And I said, I'm going to f*** you until you love me. 
[01:46:30]  Can I finish?  This activist didn't know what to do when you hugged him, Mike.  Of course he didn't.  He felt my member and thought it was the guy that was standing next to me.  It was so big.  And then he looked and no one's there.  He goes, who is that?  I said, it's my f***.  I swear to God, it's like a piston off a P-51 Mustang.  Big, fat, and long. 
[01:47:00]  I'm making move just as fast, too.  The P-51 Mustang was an escort fighter for the bombers in World War II, really turning the war around for our air battle over Berlin, letting the bombers have more air cover while leaving England for longer periods of time, decimating the German Luftwaffe.  How do you know all this?  I don't know.  I watched the Discovery Channel and... 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  Thus changing the course of the war.  War.  R.  Wow.  See?  Why do all my words start with R?  It's called a crutch.  I f*** you f***.  So, more from the activist.  So, I just posed with him and smiled for the cameras.  It's a step in the right direction, he says.  As he drove off later, he rolled down the window and explained, I told them I'm not homophobic. 
[01:48:00]  So, if I use a homophobic term, I'm not homophobic.  Isn't that a coincidence?  Because I'm also not a homo sapien.  I'm somewhere down the chart between the little...  You ever see the chart with the little hairy monkey guy?  And he's got the long arms.  Yeah.  And then there's the guy who's, like, walking with a briefcase.  And in between somewhere, I'd say about two-thirds the way up the chart, and Mike Tyson. 
[01:48:30]  Listen, I'm the missing link.  That's attractive to the gay community.  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass up.  Grab your sport on Mr. Day.  Though it may not be anyone's birthday.  And it's not near the 4th of July.  I love all your gay guests on this program.  I love Mario Cantone. 
[01:49:00]  I love Gay Marco.  I love Jay Moore.  Well, Jay's not gay.  Boy, you know.  That's the unseen episode of Moore Sports.  It was how much more of Mike Tyson could Jay take up his...  And let me tell you, it was everything.  You thought his face is red before.  You should have seen it now.  Well, it's good to see you're more open-minded, Mike.  Yeah.  I figure you've got to be in this day and age. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  You know, just because I look like this, I don't live in the Stone Age.  I understand that, you know, it's the 20th century.  21st century.  21st.  Well, I wasn't going to correct you there, Mike.  Don't correct me.  No.  All right.  You can bend over and I'll f*** you, but don't correct me.  It's okay.  I'll give you the donkey punch.  Imagine looking around, giving a fisheye and seeing my big smiling face. 
[01:50:00]  You know what I look like?  If I'm plowing your a** and you turn around and look at me, remember when King Kong smiled at Fay Wray through the window?  Remember that look?  Yes, we do.  That's the look you see before you black out from blood loss.  There ain't no need for people's intestines to be straightened out for that amount of space.  See, because they wind around in your lower abdomen. 
[01:50:30]  And they ain't supposed to be straight for a good foot or two.  Not like that.  I like a nice sphincter muscle.  All right, Mike.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So I'm accepting the gays.  Well, yeah.  And you can find that out on my 900 number.  Mike Tyson's gay man's sex line.  Hi.  This is Mike Tyson.  You've reached the hottest man's sex line ever.  Do you like big s**t in your s**t? 
[01:51:00]  I bet you do.  Hold on, Mike.  We got something.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Come on.  You a hot gay Mike Tyson sex.  Well, you could try it without Mike Tyson.  I'll give you the Mike Tyson s**t sex simulator.  Lay on the ground in front of a construction site on your belly. 
[01:51:30]  Pulls your pants down.  Wait for the roofer to drop a roll of tar paper.  If it hits correctly and goes in your s**t hole,  that's exactly what sex with Mike Tyson would be like.  Well, only if a big thing of cement falls on top of it, too.  I could push hard.  Most girls complain about a little pain in that area  after the s**t sex with me. 
[01:52:00]  Not me.  The girls complain about sinus trouble.  That's how far up that m*****er goes.  I swear to you.  That when I s**t, when I shoot s**t, you know what it looked like?  What?  You ever see that Play-Doh fun factor where you push the top  and it squeezes out the little guy's ears and nose?  That's always fun with the Play-Doh.  You ever play that?  You put it in, you push his head down, 
[01:52:30]  and it comes out the ears and nose?  I saw a chick do that once.  And I said, don't go to the cops, you s**t.  I almost popped the b*****er's head right off.  It flew right off.  It was the funniest thing.  So I'm into the gay, man.  All right.  I'm into the gay community.  You know what was funny?  It reminded me of a romantic movie I saw.  I figured I laid down on my back and let the guy get on top.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  And run it that way.  And then it reminded me of the movie Alien 
[01:53:00]  because my member burst right out of his chest.  Come on.  He couldn't take it.  F***ing p***y.  Thank you, Mike.  So I'm very much more accepting.  A little more open-minded.  Good luck with the big fight.  I suffocated the girl, giving her the Roman war helmet once.  My yam bag.  She was like a plastic bag over a child's head.  She couldn't breathe.  Breathe.  Breathe.  R.  There's my stupid R again. 
[01:53:30]  X-L-I-S-O-C-P-Q.  I'll see you at the fight.  When am I fighting?  When am I fighting?  On Saturday.  Saturday.  It's on.  It's on.  Louis Tyson is on.  I'll see you at the fight, guys.  Okay.  Thank you, Mike.  My boyfriend's in the corner.  We'll talk to you after the fight, okay?  Thank you.  We'll talk to you on Monday.  Oh, wow.  T.J.  Plastic bag over a child's head. 
[01:54:00]  What's happening, fellas?  You guys rule.  Thank you, my friend.  After yesterday's episode, I was really feeling bad for Stalker Patty.  I was really considering, you know, you guys were just really brutal.  I was thinking, I can't listen to these guys.  Yeah.  That's the one I just heard, though.  I'll never know.  Oh, look at that.  Mike brings them right back.  You guys.  You guys are rocking.  Isn't that great?  All right, T.J.  Thank you.  We'll see you later.  Bring them right back.  All right, there.  He's not fighting in New York anywhere anytime soon. 
[01:54:30]  Jersey or anything.  He's in Tennessee, and we're not syndicated to Tennessee, so you're safe for now.  All right.  Anthony, when we get back, we'll play the mess that was Stalker Patty yesterday.  Yes.  It just turned out to be just a mess.  We didn't expect it to go the way it did.  I'm not trying to make any excuses, but who knew she would react like she did when we  tried to grab the wig and stuff?  Everyone.  Oh, really? 
[01:55:00]  So we'll play that next, okay?  Right.  So stay there.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I just got to give an F.U. out to these two f***ing fat soccer moms who are standing  in front of me at the Pick and Master line getting Neil Diamond tickets.  Yeah, you have to have every Pick and Master charge explained to them, you stupid f***ing  hippos.  Pick and Master has more surcharges than you have skinfold.  What, have you been living in a donut for 20 years, you dumb twat? 
[01:55:30]  Get on with it.  No one wants to see Neil Diamond anyway, or your fat asses.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to whatever genius thought it would be cool to put a doorbell  on a commercial.  Thanks for driving my dog effing crazy, you jackass.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Brian from Jersey.  I want to give a big F.U. to the idiot who thought it would be a novel idea to stage the  Special Olympics torch run during my rush hour morning traffic commute.  F***ing idiot F.U. 
[01:56:00]  Next message.  Yo, this is a big f***ing F.U. to the assholes who were sitting in front of us as they saw  all the section 111 row S. All they did was stand the whole time.  Couldn't be a goddamn thing.  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big f***ing F.U. to the f*** in the tan Eson f***ing wagon that just  cut me off at Washington Boulevard in Philly.  F*** you.  I hope you're f***ing far rampant to a tree and you boil up in flames, you f***ing f***.  You f***ing b***h.

Once upon a time, there was a group of trusting, happy people on a game show.  And on that game show, everyone smiled and played nice together.  Sorry.  Wrong answer.  Thank you for playing.  Oh, hello, Kennedy.  Host of the new game show, Friend or Foe.  On this game show, people start out as friends.  But sometimes, they betray their new pals and take all that beautiful money for themselves. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, well, I am.  See, the fun part is trying to figure out whether people will stay friends.  Or will turn foe and sell their partner down the river.  But not everyone lives happily ever after.  Get real, buddy.  When big money is involved, people show their true colors.  Would you choose trust or betrayal?  Why, trust, of course.  Trust makes me happy.  Just like...  Can it, sunshine.  And see what money will do to a person when you watch Friend or Foe.  Okay, I will.  Are you my friend, Kennedy?  Let's not push it.  Okay, Mr. Announcer Man? 
[01:59:00]  Kennedy hosts Friend or Foe weeknights at 10.30 only on Game Show Network.  Check out Game Show Network on Comcast Cable.

[02:00:00]  Guys, if you're thinking about getting engaged, you're probably feeling the pressure.  Especially when it comes to buying her engagement ring.  You may be having a hard time seeing why a little rock has such a high price tag.  That's okay.  Most women don't see the value in titanium golf clubs or graphite fishing rods.  But the fact is, nothing you'll ever buy will last as long or mean so much to her.  And it's not about how big the diamond is or how much it costs.  Her engagement ring has to be right.

[02:06:00]  This is the Open Entry Show. 
[02:06:30]  P.O.D.  Playing the River Rave in Boston this weekend.  Yes.  We're all going.  We're bringing the party to Boston.  We'll be messing around.  Having a lot of fun.  Then we're broadcasting live from WBCN on Monday.  Because we're going to be too tired to drive back to New York.  Much too sad.  Public Enemy has been added to the lineup. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be a great time.  It is every year.  I think this is like the fourth one we've been at, right?  Yeah.  Well, the first one we were incognito, I think.  Still on bumpy ground.  So, we'll see you guys up there in Boston.  All right, Anthony.  Stark and Patty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got the audio.  By the way, has anyone heard hiding her hair from her? 
[02:07:30]  No.  It's her birthday today.  It's her birthday.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Anyway.  How do we set this up, Anthony?  Well, Patty was in the studio yesterday.  Well, I mean, there's another way to set it up, too.  I mean, I think you and I, we have this atmosphere with our radio show.  We like to push buttons.  We like to take things to the limit.  We like to use the word cringe a lot. 
[02:08:00]  Cringe is always entertaining.  Sometimes not funny.  And because of the atmosphere.  But entertaining.  We have developed here.  You know, sometimes we go too far.  What's this wee crap, white man?  Yeah.  I'm hanging you out on this one.  You could have bailed out and started playing show tunes.  Well, I did bail out at some point.  I rang my little bell and said I'd had enough. 
[02:08:30]  I was just sitting over here being sensitive to old Jimmy.  Right.  You were making me sick being so sensitive.  It's very rare.  We might have went too far.  Uh-huh.  But when you're that out of control radio show, ho-ho!  Jesus.  We don't really know where the line is.  Sometimes you drive over the line, right?  And then what surprises me, all these people that are surprised that we went too far.  Did you ever go too far on your show? 
[02:09:00]  Bill O'Reilly.  None on us.  Is this the type of radio I was talking about where you go too far?  Yes, you dick.  Well, it's a little far.  We show you all the scabs with this radio show.  Radio gone too far.  We're not polished.  We're not perfect.  The corruption of the American low life.  Sometimes it gets really ugly.  Sometimes, just like that car crash we saw just before the show on Fox, you drive right  into a damn, uh, uh, uh, piling. 
[02:09:30]  A cement bridge piling.  Sometimes it ends with the guy getting out of the car.  It's an exciting, long chase, nice, and the guy just gets out and gives up.  Sometimes the show doesn't end nice.  Sometimes the show hits.  Where the car just slows down to like five miles an hour.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's head first into a wall.  Sometimes it ends with a homeless, wigless retard crying in the middle of the street.  I think you, uh, I think you have accepted that by becoming a listener to the Opie and 
[02:10:00]  Anthony show.  Exactly.  You'd be hypocritical.  You're not always going to get that Hollywood ending here.  Yeah.  Sometimes it just ends awful.  Mm-hmm.  Does it make us proud?  No.  It's just how it is sometimes.  What can I tell you?  Not a happy ending.  It was a bad ending.  But goddamn compelling to listen to. 
[02:10:30]  I'll tell you that.  Did you have a Turk 182 reference?  Hmm?  No.  Did I?  Which one?  I loved that movie.  Rob.  Rob.  Hey.  Rob.  Yeah.  What's up, boys?  Anthony had a Turk 182 reference?  Absolutely.  When the guy's coming down off the bridge at the end of the movie and he says, what are  we going to do?  When he comes down here and he looks at him and he says, we?  What's this we at, white man?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Well, that's just an old saying.  Yeah, you're reaching, buddy.  You're reaching.  I'm out. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  We'll approach you by taking Patty's wig.  Spazzini.  So, this is how it went down yesterday, Anthony.  Yes.  In all its ugliness.  Let's give a listen.  This is really, really, really brutal.  It's reality programming.  It is brutal.  You are not going to hear a Hollywood ending at the end of this bit. 
[02:11:30]  People aren't going to be running out saying, surprise, it was all a gag.  Hey!  Some movies don't have happy endings.  No.  Name one.  Look at Night of the Living Dead.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo.  The guy gets shot at the end of the guy.  He makes it through the zombies the whole night.  And he comes out of the house when the day breaks and the cop shoots him right between  the eyes. 
[02:12:00]  And he wasn't a zombie.  Right.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  JFK.  JFK.  White Chicks Incorporated.  New York damn movies.  See?  They don't all end happy.  And we didn't even know it was going to go this way.  It's one of those.  It just did.  You know those movies where all of a sudden you're watching and it's just been something  horrific and the screen goes black and the credits start rolling and you're like,  oh my God, was that depressing.  Oof.  So here's your pals, Opie and Anthony, showing their awfulness. 
[02:12:30]  XFL game day.  It's a horrific ending.  Liam Neeson should be crying in the street.  I could have just saved a wig.  I could have just saved the wig.  All right.  Yeah.  We might have to stop the tape from time to time.  Oh.  Just to make some comments, maybe.  All right.  Well, let's listen in.  All right.  We came back from break with this.  A couple of phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-2774. 
[02:13:00]  Wow.  Where do you want to go now, Ann?  We've got Stalker Patty outside with an awful hairdo.  I wouldn't mind finding out where the hell my $200 went.  Awful pale thighs.  She's just a mess.  Let's get her in here real fast.  Yeah.  Come on.  In and out.  You know what I was thinking this weekend?  What?  It's time to cut her loose.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Her time is coming, guys.  Patty?  Yes?  We're going to cut you loose soon.  I think we're just going to cut you loose from the show.  You know what I mean? 
[02:13:30]  There's not much else we could do with you.  Yeah.  You know?  Would you let us behead you?  Patty, what else would you let us do to you?  Because we're really thinking of cutting you loose, finally.  We've explored you as much as we can.  Yeah.  We've gotten rid of your nip hair.  We've fixed your feet.  Your feet.  We've shaved your head.  We've got you felt up for the first time.  You're welcome.  And down.  And down by Ron Jeremy.  Ron Jeremy.  The first time your patch was ever touched.  We've shaved your head twice now. 
[02:14:00]  What else can we do to you?  Yeah.  Unless you're willing to lose your virginity or something, I think we're going to cut you loose.  Yeah.  You want to maybe do that?  I want to be a friend of the show.  Well, some people can't be anymore.  I think you wear out your welcome a little.  But I love you all.  No, you don't.  You're infatuated.  You're, you know, it's exciting to be here.  It's exciting to walk out in front of thousands and thousands of people and have them cheering and know who you are and stuff. 
[02:14:30]  But you're starting to think that we're really your friends.  And I got to tell you.  Yeah.  We're just not.  We're just using you.  This isn't anything about friendship.  It's just using you for good radio.  Yeah.  But I think we've run our course.  And, you know, you might have a limited time with Ron and Fez.  But after that, you know, it's pretty much over, Patty.  There was a time we had to cut Dan from Hoboken loose.  And, you know, he moved on to the Ron and Fez show.  I think we're going to cut you loose soon.  We're going to have to cut you loose, Patty. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Unless you can come up with something else we can do.  But I'm very loyal to the station and I'm very loyal to the show.  Well, the station's one thing.  The show is just the show.  It's nothing about loyalty.  It's just about, I don't think there's anything else we can do with you.  Yeah.  When it comes down to it, Ant and I are big businessmen now.  And we have no use for you anymore.  See, it's not about friendship.  Let's just put it this way.  You're like a cassette player.  And Ant and I are now looking for, like, an iPod. 
[02:15:30]  Can you pull off your wig so it makes it even more uncomfortable?  Yeah, Patty, pull your wig off.  Keep it off.  Put it on the console for a little while while we just rag you.  So, Patty, we really don't see anything else you can do for this program.  We'll make sure, you know, you're compensated for what you did.  And that's it.  I think it's over.  Tim, what's wrong?  This is really bugging me.  Hey, look, how about if she just promises not to pull her pants up like William Frawley anymore? 
[02:16:00]  Hey, Rick.  Patty, your pants are all the way up to your...  What the hell is that?  Just stop with the Fred Merck's pants.  Just, you know...  Hey, hey.  You can't boot her, man.  Patty, what else can we do to you?  Got any ideas?  It's all about ratings.  We're feeling like we're not getting the big ratings with you anymore.  Yeah.  Not really working out.  You know?  You gave us some good times and some lofts.  We lofted.  Yeah.  But I don't think there's much left for you here. 
[02:16:30]  And I think it's time you moved on.  And we all moved on.  I think, you know, you've got to leave on top.  And having your head shaved in front of, I don't know, over 7,000 people on Saturday is a good way to end your career with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a retiring event right there that you can then retire on.  It's okay.  I see your lip quivering.  It's okay to cry.  It's, you know, it's a lot of big sports figures do that when they retire and they know they're going to be out of the public eye. 
[02:17:00]  You want to leave on an up note?  Willie May should have never played with the Mets.  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  I think he was like 48 years old.  Tom Seaver's comeback was a disgrace.  Maybe we could just put Patty in a little train car and Liam Neeson could shoot water on her with a hose.  I can't see keeping her around anymore.  So, Patty?  I don't want to lose contact with anybody. 
[02:17:30]  I want to stay friendly with them.  You never were friendly or had contact with us.  This is just, it's business.  It's all about just getting big ratings.  It has nothing to do with the personal and enjoying one's company.  Did we ever go out to dinner with you?  Did we ever invite you over our house?  Did we ever share a drink with you?  Did we ever get you a card?  When all of us went to happy hour after a show or something, were you invited?  Did you go to any after parties for any of these events you show up at? 
[02:18:00]  No.  No, see, it's, we're not your friends, Patty.  We're just people that were doing a show.  Were you ever invited to Paisanos with the rest of the gang?  No, I've never gone with anyone.  See, there's a reason for that, Patty.  You've got to understand, it's because we're not your friends.  We're, when everyone else.  We're a show.  When everyone else was being limoed around from gig to gig and you had to take the bus.  Yeah.  I didn't mind that at all.  Well, it just shows you that we are a show and you are, you know, a limited commodity for that program for a limited time. 
[02:18:30]  And now, you know, it's, it's over.  Your expiration date has been met.  And I mean, how many times can we shave your head?  Yeah.  Two is enough.  We did it twice.  So, I don't, I don't see this going any further, Patty.  I think you're done with this program.  I think you're done with the station in general.  With the station.  I think we're going to have to say something that.  We're going to have to pass this along to Rana Fez.  Yeah.  And I.  Don't do that.  No. 
[02:19:00]  Don't.  What are you doing?  Don't give her any more money.  Are you putting out money to give her?  He wasn't giving her money.  He was just saying how he can't pay his goddamn rent and credit card.  No, he feels guilty and he's going to give her money.  Why are you giving her money?  I'm giving her nothing.  You are going to give her money.  I'm not giving her money.  What is bothering you about this?  I don't like it.  But no, I will not give Patty money.  Oh, look at it.  He doesn't like it.  Why?  He's getting a little, he's getting a little, little shaky about this whole thing.  Because they look like twins now.  That's why.  So, Patty, would you have a problem with us instructing Ken Stevens and everybody else 
[02:19:30]  that you're no longer.  I didn't.  I want to be your friends.  I don't want to lose contact with anybody.  We're not your friends.  I didn't.  You didn't what?  Look, she sounds like Cheswick when McMurphy was leaving.  I've always been very loyal.  Doesn't matter.  That's a good thing.  But, you know, time has come and it's time, I think it's time you moved on.  I think the show and the station is affecting your life. 
[02:20:00]  I think it would be better for you in the long run.  You'll look back and say, you know, that was probably the best move I could have made  is being cut loose from the program.  Now I could find a job that I don't have to worry about listening to a show.  You know?  You've got to agree deep down, right, Patty?  Behind your tears.  Behind the tears.  Her legs are clear.  You'll move on.  But I don't want to lose anybody.  You don't have anybody.  You'll realize you're not losing much when you turn around and walk away. 
[02:20:30]  You'll make real friends.  People that really care about you.  Not people that just use you.  But I had such a good time.  Had.  Very, very important that you said had.  But I still want to have a good time.  Well, Lana.  Isn't it true you can't have a job because you can't stop listening to the radio?  That's true, isn't it?  You are a loser.  I have a job.  You cannot have a job between 3 and 11.  I do have a job.  Because you listen to us and Ron and Fest.  Oh, she also listens to Pharrell.  She drives the morning show crazy in the morning.  They all complain about what a pain in the ass she is. 
[02:21:00]  Do you do that?  Ben's been waiting for this day for a long time.  Go ahead, Ben.  Say everything you have been saying in the back office.  Go ahead.  I've been saying it all.  Right to her face.  Right there.  Look her in the eye.  Her lip is quivering.  You are a complete loser, Patty.  You drive everyone around here crazy.  You're driving the morning show guys.  All they do is complain when we get in the morning about you washing your hair when you  used to have your hair in the disgusting bathroom over there.  What's wrong, Norton?  Norton doesn't like this.  He's really upset.  What's the problem? 
[02:21:30]  Are you okay, Jimmy?  I'm fine, yes.  Yes.  It's not bad.  You've been doing karaoke and stuff on Ron and Fez, right?  Yeah, but...  So that was good, but...  But she can't even do that anymore.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we're saying.  We're pretty much...  I think it's better for you that you know...  A lot of people are very pissed off on the phone lines, Anthony.  This is called tough love.  It's tough love, right.  We've got to push her out the door so she can get a life.  So you know the security guys downstairs, Patty?  We're going to have to...  Well, they've been instructed not to let you go anymore. 
[02:22:00]  And we're changing the codes.  They're going to have to tell you that they've been instructed that...  And if you've noticed, we've got a couple moving guys that are removing the couch you've  been sleeping on under the stairs.  Yeah.  How about one round of Bukkake before Patty leaves?  But I don't...  Good luck.  Patty, would you be up for a round of Bukkake?  I don't know what that is.  No, you know, she looks like the glasses.  Private Joker!  Show me your Warface!  With a crew cut in the glass.  Could you just say, that's a negative rafter, man? 
[02:22:30]  Sir, I said it, sir!  Patty, at least you have the memories, right?  Right.  You have good memories, right?  That's all you need.  Just think of us as a loved one that passed on.  You have the good memories, but you know that you'll never, ever, ever see them again.  Right?  But I didn't...  Patty?  What did I do?  Patty?  You have two minutes to say goodbye to your fans.  There you go.  I don't want to say...  Go ahead.  Start in.  Here it is.  Now.  Two minutes.  Regardless of what you say, this is your final two minutes on WNEW. 
[02:23:00]  Why are you doing this?  And all the other stations we broadcast to.  Say goodbye to your fans, Patty.  I don't know.  Shut up, Jimmy, with your fake effing morality.  I...  No, I believe me.  I normally...  Look, just because she looks like Tim Robbins in Jacob's Ladder, I don't think this should  be voted.  A Jacob's Ladder reference.  Nice.  Yeah.  Louis Black was in the movie.  I know.  I was just thinking of Louis.  Can I start the music again?  Patty, you really have two minutes.  Say hi to Sigourney Weaver on that penal colony from Alien 4. 
[02:23:30]  Can we give Patty her two minutes?  I don't want...  All right, here's your two minutes.  I don't...  Starting...  Hold on.  Starting now, you've got two minutes to say goodbye to everybody.  Say goodbye to everyone.  I don't want to say goodbye to anybody.  Just because she has a body and head like a two-day-old sparrow, that's no reason to  believe it.  I didn't do anything so wrong.  Jim, hold on, Patty.  Patty, it's nothing about what you don't want to happen.  This is happening.  Now, just use this two minutes to say goodbye to the audience.  Anthony and I, we have to make tough decisions from time to time.  It's called tough love. 
[02:24:00]  And we truly believe that...  Your time has come and gone.  This is better for you and your life.  So, two minutes.  Don't complain.  Don't do anything.  Say goodbye to your fans.  Here it is.  Well, she can do whatever she wants with the two minutes.  All right.  This will be the last two minutes of radio that Stalker Patty does.  Here it is.  I didn't...  I didn't...  I don't want to...  I didn't do anything.  I don't...  I mean...  I don't understand where you're coming from.  I didn't say...  I didn't talk in the dugout or maybe say two words. 
[02:24:30]  I'm a quiet person.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't...  I don't...  I don't understand.  Look, just because she has toes like macadamia nuts, there's no reason to toss her off the radio.  Jim.  Look, I don't think that Dudley Moore feet should be thrown out.  Jim.  Please.  We want Stalker Patty to say goodbye.  Patty, just say goodbye to your fans. 
[02:25:00]  Did you enjoy your 15 minutes of fame?  It lasted a while.  You had a good run.  It's over, though.  Dean from D.C. wants to know.  You had a longer radio career than Mason and Kalinsky.  Right.  In New York.  So that's something to be proud of.  Yep.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Come on, Patty.  You lasted longer in New York City radio than Tom Likas.  Yeah.  Put the wig on.  At least have a little bit of dignity through this whole procedure.  No, we like with the wig off. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Patty, I'm sorry that Jim Norton keeps interrupting you.  You've got two minutes to say goodbye.  To everybody in this room and to your fans.  Last time you're going to be here.  I don't...  I don't want to say goodbye.  We never all want to say goodbye.  I didn't do anything.  I don't understand.  She's shaking like she's starring in on Golden Pond.  This is not right.  Jim. 
[02:26:00]  Jim.  We just want to get through this.  We're trying.  It's very uncomfortable for everybody.  We don't feel good about this.  We just know it's good for the show that we get rid of Stalker Patty.  Patty, you keep saying you didn't do anything.  It's not about doing anything.  It's what we've done.  We can't...  There's nothing more you can do.  I mean...  That's what it is.  It's over.  We can't think of anything else to do with you after getting your head shaved in front  of 7,000 people on Saturday.  So get over it and use this time now.  Two minutes.  Anthony and I are marketing geniuses and we know when to say goodbye to them. 
[02:26:30]  We know.  We know.  Okay, so...  We feel it and it's done.  So please, you've got two minutes to say goodbye to everybody.  This will be the last time you see all our faces.  And two minutes to say goodbye to the listeners that support you.  All right?  And if Jimmy will shut up, your two minutes begins now.  I love everybody.  I don't want to say goodbye to anybody.  I love everyone.  I like to keep friendships.  All right, listen, Lou Gehrig.  There's no reason to be making this speech. 
[02:27:00]  You know, I...  I'm the luckiest gimp, gimp, gimp on the face of the earth.  Jim.  I don't even know where you're coming.  Patty, I'm sorry.  This is only prolonging her agony, Jim.  We want her to leave with dignity.  We just want her to get her two minutes.  Her two minutes is to say all her goodbyes.  Turn her back.  And Patty, when the time does come, when you do finally get this two minutes,  as long as Jim shuts up, you will turn around.  You will walk out that door.  Walk to the elevators.  Take it down.  Don't look back. 
[02:27:30]  And never, ever come up to this floor or in this building, actually, again, Patty.  And please end with your mom's box, okay?  Hold on, hold on.  Here's your two minutes to say what you need to say.  You know, tomorrow was my birthday, and I had...  And it still is your birthday.  Yeah, and I was going to come up to Ron and Fez, and this is for my birthday. 
[02:28:00]  Wow.  No, we have made a deal with Ron and Fez and Scott Farrell.  We all believe this is the right thing to do.  We all sat in a meeting.  You will notice this radio station here in New York is moving forward.  We're getting rid of some dead weight.  Out with the old, in with the new is the motto around here, Patty.  And we talked with Farrell.  We talked with Ron and Fez.  And we thought it would be best for you, also, if, you know, you were just banned from coming up here 
[02:28:30]  and you could get on with your life.  Because this station is becoming like a drug for you that you're addicted to,  and you need to quit it cold turkey.  So we're trying tough love, and we're banning you from the building here.  And you have two minutes now to say goodbye.  And this is it.  Just say goodbye.  Right.  And please say something nice about Aunt and I, because I think we've done a lot of nice things for you.  Okay?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Two minutes. 
[02:29:00]  I loved the show since August of 1998.  Can you separate your teeth a little when you talk?  Jim.  Jim.  I've been, uh...  Hold on.  Sorry.  What?  Jim, you're just prolonging her agony.  She's very upset about this, and we can all see it.  She's quivering.  Her lip is moving, and there's tears welling up in her eyes.  And she understands that this is the last time she's going to say anything on these microphones.  The last time she's going to be in here on any show. 
[02:29:30]  And she's going to go back to obscurity, what her life was before,  and just try to get along now with her own life without this station being a part of it.  And, Patty, could you do it topless for us, please?  No.  Wrong with you.  How about if she promises to do something just so she doesn't have the facial structure of Richard Widmark?  Jim, it's her 47th birthday tomorrow, so let's hear her out, okay?  Oh, happy birthday.  All right.  Patty, two minutes to say goodbye.  There's a lot of people you should thank, okay?  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:30:00]  I've been a big fan since August 98.  I met you Thanksgiving of 98 when I worked for a charity that did an event up here.  And I got to know you through the last three years.  I don't want it to be goodbye.  I want to be able to come to a road show and say hello to you all and be like a friend, you know. 
[02:30:30]  I've done nothing but support everybody.  I haven't been a pest or anything.  I'm not obnoxious.  I'm a very quiet, low-key kind of a person.  I don't know what this is all about, you know.  Even if I could just remain a friend of the show, you know, without, you know, you doing anything to me, it would be, you know, nice, you know. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, I didn't do anything wrong to anybody.  I've never wronged anyone.  Patty, one minute to go.  Start the thank yous.  Tell everyone how great Ant and I are.  Anthony and Opie and Anthony are really great.  You know, they're one among the finest talents on the radio.  And Jim Norton, he's okay, right?  Jim Norton's great, too.  He's a great comedian.  Forty seconds ago. 
[02:31:30]  This is it.  Your last 40 seconds on the air.  I do want to come up and hang tomorrow night with Ron and Opie for my birthday.  Ain't going to happen.  This is the last time you're going to be in here.  That's it.  Doors open.  How much time left, Opie?  We'll give her like 30 more seconds because we interrupted a little bit.  Yes, Patty?  I don't want anyone to hate me.  I want you to be friendly to me.  Oh, Rick's grabbing her arm. 
[02:32:00]  This is it, Patty.  There you go.  Time is up.  Is that it, Patty?  Yeah.  Turn around.  Don't look back.  Here it is.  The last time you're going to see this station.  Oh, wait.  Patty?  Slam the door, please.  There.  Good riddance.  There it is.  The end of Stalker Patty.  Oh, we've got to be tough.  Got to be tough.  Oh, it's the right thing to do.  Of course it is.  Opie, by the way, Jerry West is the NBA logo. 
[02:32:30]  It's been confirmed.  Oh, look at that.  Getting back to more important things.  Anthony, Rick is on the phone as we get her removed from the building.  Rick?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I just got the call from security.  They're aware of it, and we're bringing her down now so they can take a look at her and  make sure that they've got all her info before they keep her out of the building.  Can we put Stalker Patty back on the air, please?  Sure.  All right.  Come on, Patty.  Stand up.  Grab your cane.  Patty? 
[02:33:00]  Hello?  Patty.  It's open, Anthony, and we just want to make sure you realize this is for your own  good, okay?  But I don't...  It's for your own good.  This is it, Patty.  It's for your own good, and you're never to come back up here again.  Why do you hate me?  For any...  It's not hatred.  This is a...  We're helping you.  It's all about ratings, my dear.  We've got to move on to the next freak, and then you get your life in order.  There's many freaks in the big city.  Your time is come and gone.  I'm not a criminal or anything. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  If we had some kind of a friendship that we developed over these years, then, you know,  you'd still be around, but it's obvious that we were just using you for good radio,  and that good radio is now over.  So, all right.  Bye-bye, Patty.  Rick, what's going on?  Okay, we just...  We got downstairs to the lobby area.  Okay.  I'm going to take her to the front so the security guys know that this is the one.  All right, put her back on.  All right, hold on.  Hello?  Hey, Patty.  Yes?  This is the last time you'll be seeing the lobby. 
[02:34:00]  I don't understand.  Well, there's not much to really understand.  That's all.  Out with the old, in with the new is what we like to say.  And your time here is done, Patty.  So, bye-bye.  You all right with this, Patty?  Not really, because I don't fully understand.  Well, you're simple-minded.  You don't really need to understand.  Yeah.  Just face it.  Now you can move on with your life.  All right, yeah.  Come on.  Are you out the door yet?  Walking out the door now. 
[02:34:30]  How many people are around you, Patty?  A few.  Could you have less pizzazz on the phone?  I don't understand it.  No need to understand.  It's bye-bye time.  Are you outside the building now, Patty?  Yeah, outside the building.  You do understand now that you are not...  You are in the courtyard.  You can't stay here.  You are not to come back in the building, right?  You're not even allowed to hang out in the courtyard anymore like you used to before we invite  you up here for the first time.  But you're acting like I'm a very dangerous person.  No, it's just time to move on, Patty. 
[02:35:00]  Bye-bye.  You understand?  Bye-bye.  Okay?  What?  It's over.  Here, I don't want to talk anymore.  Oh, she doesn't talk anymore.  Why doesn't she want to talk anymore?  What's the matter?  Why don't you want to talk anymore, Patty?  It's just not right.  She says it's not right.  Oh, it's right.  Sure it is.  I've been a very good fan of the show.  I've been very loyal.  I always support you. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, get a hold of yourself.  What's...  Rick?  Hello?  What?  What's going on?  Well, we've got it to the corner of 57th and 7th, and that's, I guess, the legal distance.  It's about 100 yards from our front door.  All right.  So that's where they told us to leave her.  All right.  Maybe some final thoughts from Patty.  One final thought.  Patty, do you have a final thought before we walk away? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Can I still keep in touch?  No.  No.  No.  No.  It's over.  Can I call in and say hello?  Nope.  Your call will not be accepted.  I don't want to lose any friendship.  I don't want to lose anybody.  You have no friendship.  You have no friends here.  It's over.  And Patty, just to make sure you understand, there will be a restraining order that will  be presented to you.  Why?  It's just the right thing to do, to make sure you know we're serious about this one.  Why are you doing this to me? 
[02:36:30]  Because it's over.  Is it because I came back to get the rest of the money or something?  It's over, Patty.  No, it's just over.  It's just over.  You have nothing more to add for us.  All right?  Oh.  Any last word for everybody?  I had a good time.  I don't understand why it ends, but I had a good time.  Had.  That's good that you said that.  I've been a very good fan of the show.  Yeah, but you've got to move on.  I mean, people aren't watching MASH anymore. 
[02:37:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, see?  There's new things.  There's new things to check out.  Okay?  There was a time we all loved Beavis and Butthead.  It's just not on TV anymore.  Patty?  Yeah, but you just don't throw people away.  I didn't do anything wrong.  Bye, Patty.  Rick, why don't you take the phone away from Patty?  Bye-bye, Patty.  No.  All right, Rick, tell her to turn and walk away.  All right.  Patty, since we can't escort you any further, you need to turn around and just walk away. 
[02:37:30]  That way, please.  Keep going.  That way.  Is she limping along with her cane?  Yep.  Go.  That way.  There it goes.  Oh, Rick?  Yeah.  Tell her that that's not her wig.  That's property.  Oh, Patty, by the way.  That's property of the radio station.  Please tell me.  The radio station actually owns that wig.  They've asked me to take it from you.  Pull it off her head.  Oh.  Yeah, I need to take it from you.  I can't.  I have a job and everything, and I have to see people.  It's the only thing I can find them. 
[02:38:00]  No, they're asking me to take it because it's property of the station.  Pull it off her head, Rick.  Pull it off her head.  Please.  Pull it off her head.  Please don't do this to me.  Take the wig.  Please.  I don't want anyone to see me like that.  I don't want anyone to see me.  I have a job and everything.  Please.  I don't want to see you saying, please.  Did she wet herself yet?  Please.  Rick.  Yeah.  Take the wig.  I can't.  Take the wig. 
[02:38:30]  All right, Patty.  All right, Patty, now we have to take the wig.  So if you can just.  If you don't.  I don't know what I look like without it.  But if you don't hand it to me, I'll be forced to take it off your head.  No.  Don't do it, please.  I don't want anyone to see me.  I can't go to work like this.  I don't have anything to like this.  Take the wig.  Please.  Take the wig.  All right, I've reached my limit.  Take the wig. 
[02:39:00]  I've reached my limit.  Get Steve on the phone.  He has the balls to take it.  All right, Patty, Patty, Patty.  Relax, relax, relax.  I've reached my limit.  Relax.  Patty, Patty.  I don't want to see Steve.  Don't worry.  Just relax.  I'm out.  Take the wig.  Don't worry.  Just relax.  What happened to your finger, by the way?  Hey, Rick.  What is that?  Hey, Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  Make sure she put...  He can't take you to walk.  Get her all relaxed.  She'll put her hands down to her side, and then you grab it and run, okay?  Boom.  Okay.  So you're fine. 
[02:39:30]  Okay?  Here it comes.  You can relax.  Oh, no.  You can relax.  Well, just remember you have to walk in that direction, okay?  All right, Rick.  Is that okay, guys?  Yes.  All right.  Is she still holding on to the jake?  We're going to let her walk this way.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:40:00]  Everybody's looking at me.  That's what they do, Ken.  Thank you.  All right, now turn and walk away.  All right.  Why did you do that?  All right, buddy.  Walk away.  All right.  Walk.  I can't take this.  Oh, my God.  I can't take this.  All right.  Rick, you got the wig?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going out.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  Oh, my God.  I know where my line is now. 
[02:40:30]  I know where my limit is.  I can't take the crying old virgin woman crying about her hair.  That's awful.  Oh, my God.  That was horrid.  Guys, it's tough love.  Oh, God.  It's tough love.  Oh, but you have some issues, man.  We knew it wasn't going to be easy.  You got some goddamn issues.  We knew it wasn't going to be easy, guys.  We had to do it.  You know that.  If you could bring in a puppy tomorrow, we could stab and torture. 
[02:41:00]  That was like when they pulled the bag off the elephant man's head.  They're staring at me.  Oh, my.  She should be wearing a burlap hat with an eye cut out of the middle.  Hey, man.  I don't feel good about it.  You guys don't.  But it's something we had to do.  You do feel good about it.  You understand that.  Wow.  You guys understand that much, right?  Ben, you all right with the decision?  It's the greatest thing we've ever done.  Can we play Cool in the Gang celebration?  Ben looks like Boston fans after the Patriots won the Super Bowl.  You just heard that little scuffle? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  I wish he's probably her thin little fingers trying to grip at the wig and Rick's hands.  Look, I...  It's staring at me.  We would love to go to the phones, but trust me, guys, we had to do this today.  I know you want to yell and scream, but it's the right thing.  Very angry people.  Very angry people.  Okay.

The 94 WISP Extreme Team.  Maybe you wake up this morning and go,  Oh, how am I going to get through today?  Oh, I'm so tired.  You should have went to your refrigerator and popped open some Venom,  the perfect energy drink for when you need an energy hit, like in the morning, 
[02:43:00]  or after work.  Maybe you've got a party to go to, or a meeting, or whatever,  and you're beat, pop a Venom, and it tastes good, too.  Yeah.  High-potency energy drink when your body needs a lift.  It's powerful energy ingredients.  It includes a unique formulation of ingredients.  Yeah, cooling effect you feel when you drink it.  Then it delivers this instant bite and an immediate energy hit.  You feel it.  Venom's energy ingredients at higher levels than a lot of the other energy drinks out there  when your body needs a boost.  Venom's invigorating flavors serves up as an excellent mixer, 
[02:43:30]  so you take it to the party with you.  Mix it with some vodka.  Sold in convenience stores.  Comes in an eight-ounce can.  Perfect for a quick energy hit when you're out on the go.  Venom, a high-potency energy drink with the instant bite.  But it hardly sang to Peggy Sue and his legend grew.  Just like Dr. Pepper, originality lives forever.  Let's raise a Dr. Pepper.

Well, that's my soul.  Let's raise a Dr. Pepper.  The taste of originality.  Salutes individuality. 
[02:44:30]  And gives life a personality.  Be you.  Do what you do.  Be you.  Nothing's better than Dr. Pepper.  Things I am disgusted with by Nigel Huffington.  Number one, mahogany.  Two, the pelican.  Three, mixed doubles.  Four, Elaine Shepard, 11 Wedgworth Way, Coventry.  Five, chutney.  Six, violas. 
[02:45:00]  Seven, the number six.  And finally, I am disgusted with the rocket widget.  Not only for its silly name, but also for the audacity of the people at Guinness.  For thinking that such a device inside a bottle could simulate the creamy, rich brew of a draft-poured Guinness.  Point of note, I would like to change my last entry by removing the glorious rocket widget from the list of things I am disgusted with, and replacing it with myself, Nigel Huffington.  As I am disgusted with myself for ever doubting the ingenuity and genius of the people at Guinness. 
[02:45:30]  I shall now leave to thrash myself thoroughly and with great vigor.  Guinness Draft is imported by Guinness Bass Import Company, Stanford, Connecticut.

They're expecting some kind of Hollywood ending, and you're just not going to get it this time around.  No, that's about it.  Know what kind of ending you're getting today?  The ending of, like, the movie Seven.  Seven, a movie without a happy ending.  But instead of...  Absolutely not.  Instead of the head in the box, it's the wig.  The wig in the box.  What's in the box?  What's in the box? 
[02:56:00]  What's in the bigs?  Well, Anthony, we thought it was appropriate maybe to bring us all back together here that we would do something special for Patty and remember her in song today.

[03:04:30]  and dude do you absolutely think i care at all and what's the well that's why he was so bummed  that because you didn't care perhaps if nicky had had an exploding schlong i would have been  concerned and loved to have heard how it turned out or if my nephew nicky did it because he ate  or if little nicky did it the only thing sadder than listening yesterday is listening to voss trying  to be smart we're going to have a Starbucks i gotta say this yeah yeah the more boss ignorance  because our job is going to Starbucks i'm like i like an iced coffee and boss is like i want one 
[03:05:00]  of those sclones a sclone what it's a scone well i didn't know it was a scone how many people would  know what a scone anyone over the age of seven 45 year old asian man i want sclone that's what i  thought it was called a sclone okay what you did and our team one you could say our team one  no you can't our it's our oh like you are an idiot our team one you know what's weird anthony 
[03:05:30]  yeah voss doesn't even realize he's next oh i'm next oh my god stop it oh jacy morgan's been  calling i know okay you can't take voss's john to tour a wig i'll tell you the most brutal part  of that is when when you said we're all in the limos and you're taking the bus you know i got  to clear that up for everybody we don't take limos yeah i was just i was just working i'm just i was  just putting the whole thing over the top anthony bails out with one minute to go wow i know one 
[03:06:00]  minute to go hey look that's like when they were beating pesci with the bats in casino after the tent  hit all right i'm done oh oh wow because it was all that was the way a rough road really started  now now we're gonna have a flare up here because i'll tell you one thing you were brutal for 27  minutes of that bit i was brutal for maybe uh 20 seconds you listen no you listen to that brutal  through the whole thing everything i said dude you know this is radio so you're like we see you over  there uh with your lip uh twitching and your and your tears and your and your legs shaking you said that 
[03:06:30]  just to make sure the listeners realize how how uncomfortable it was i was sticking how much he was  suffering i was sticking with the premise that we needed to remove her from the show and i was  giving her every bit of fact as to why she would not be welcome back on this program i when the crying  started and when the the take her wig take her wig started that's when i was like all right  check please i fully admit sometimes something just snaps in my head i don't know and you were 
[03:07:00]  brutal for 20 seconds the whole time oh we're not your friends we're never your friends right we just  use you for good radio yeah you said that who said that you weren't brutal for 20 i was saying  it's business yeah there's nothing left for you here times i'm gonna do shot 40 oh i'm out now  that's it one no it's not i bowed out before the shooting yeah what i might have taunted with the n-word  but then i i didn't uh start firing so you're using the wrong thing you make it sound like i bailed out 
[03:07:30]  in the middle of the worst part i bailed out right when the bad stuff started happening started  started yes we had her kicked out of the building we had her that wasn't what got everybody it's the  wig look it you were the middle act you were still part of the show okay so are you part of the show  are you trying to say if we didn't do the wig thing hey you touch my sister's wig again i'll kill  you okay son of a bitch are you trying of a bitch are you trying to say that if we didn't do the wig 
[03:08:00]  thing more people would uh would understand today how are we i believe the wig thing put it over the  the ultimate degradation no let me tell you something anthony there's uh it is split right  down the middle does this mean i still i don't have to pay it 100 i promised no don't worry about  that all right uh sarah what's up hey oh hey um one problem with the listeners here is uh they're  listening to you they can actually uh say that they're they didn't turn off they didn't turn off 
[03:08:30]  the radio today you get it you know you didn't lose listeners it's bs they're saying oh i'm never  going to listen to you again because they're calling you hey yeah you know something i think  you're right you're right it is a bunch of bunk and on top of that yeah yeah this is a tough love  like you explained it she doesn't love if you didn't take her wig she would not realize the fact  that she doesn't need to be there you're right it's better for her that you did this and  and the harshness that said you said you never wanted her back she won't turn her butt back  around there she knows that she has not wanted she'll try have you guys ever been through an 
[03:09:00]  intervention it's not pretty exactly you know you get you get the whole family together and friends  and you're not feeding the the the kid cocaine as you tell him how awful he is and what's the worst  if she kills herself obi gets drunk goes into central park gets beat up and robin williams helps  them no and she killed herself okay ridden hold on hold on hold on sarah what what it was a king  fisher oh that was great it was okay that wasn't good it was okay wow all right uh sarah back to you 
[03:09:30]  so that's just clones a good actor dope no but i mean you're you're not gonna lose listeners  because you goddamn jews are really dumb and sometimes it's gonna get ugly with this program  we know that come on no just remember all the hilarity we gave you exactly for every hundred  hilarities we give you one awfulness just relax it hopefully evens out somehow exactly you have 
[03:10:00]  six demented listeners listening to you because of who you are this is probably the twistest thing  you could have done and to be darn skippy i'm listening to you today just to hear it again i  heard ron and fest they're gonna play it i think you're hilarious and it's the best thing you could  have done for there you go it's cringe radio what do you what do you think that means  cringe to go like god i can't do right that's it deal with it happen it's part of uh radio history 
[03:10:30]  what you know what we want to do we want to get um like the top 10  cringiest moments of the on a show gee i wonder where that rates  i think that would be about three three yeah i don't think that it's a guarantee that's the  the number one cringe did i miss when we killed someone's child what what is 
[03:11:00]  do you remember she sounded like edith bunker during the rape oh the rape of edith bunker remember  when all the family just went to hell remember when all the family went to hell and it wasn't funny  anymore and every episode was a special episode and edith was home alone and the guy came in to rape her  like ripping her blouse off she's like oh watchy oh norris starts doing his act 
[03:11:30]  hey that's right eat it there you're getting raped hey have so many weeks there that'll prevent a rape  our house  we'll have anthony we'll have the listeners decide  in the six o'clock are  in the midnight are

[03:26:00]  it's been 24 hours and people still want to vent anthony yes people very angry very very angry  and now you're starting to get pissed off over there a little bit huh well some of these people uh the  listeners um i thought they understood this program i thought they knew what this show was about 
[03:26:30]  uh perhaps it really uh isn't for them then i don't know they don't seem to understand that  the way we do our show it opens up the possibility for things just like this  there's always a chance when you listen to the show that there's going to be just  a disaster unfolding in front of your eyes watching uh automobile race  you know they're doing a good clip a couple hundred miles an hour around that track 
[03:27:00]  and then when they crash you go oh what why so much damage  well because the whole thing with the race is to go very fast  and there's no guarantee you don't end up on the wall  we go very fast with this radio show  and patty had ended up into the wall  the hindenburg  the hindenburg  all those spectators they they thought they were going to see a nice soft landing  ah they're going to bring the hindenburg and all this  oh oh oh it's like what the f is this  oh get out of the way oh this is a horrible day this is the worst disaster i've ever seen  well that's what happens when you fill a balloon full of hydrogen 
[03:27:30]  in dallas all they want to do is wave at jfk  who saw that wave  but the nature of the beast you know you go through the streets like that with the convertible they warned him  but that's what he wanted to do and he opened himself up to his head opening up  see i remember the time i i was watching monday night football  uh-oh  right in front of my eyes joe theisman  i didn't want to see that 
[03:28:00]  but it happens  well when lt is jumping on people  there's a chance that that leg might snap  go ahead jim here's the awful  yes jim yeah jim  i don't have one actually  oh no  i was just thinking about  yeah  you reminded me of platoon yesterday  when the guy got shot he's going  take the wig  take the wig  take the wig  bag this piece of  that was definitely over the top  but i'm okay now  well 
[03:28:30]  i'm all right  you're okay  yeah  you haven't lost it like that in a while  i'm all right  sometimes kids in houston just want to go in and take a bath  laurie  yes  go ahead laurie  you know number one i want to tell you guys you always plug how you guys go through a bunch of cities in the u.s  you are not countrywide you're nationwide now i'm calling from toronto  wow  you guys rock  oh thank you  we get a lot of calls from toronto  what is perturbing let me tell you is that the reception sucks winds 
[03:29:00]  how are the bernardos  what's that  how are the bernardos  well the reception sucks up in toronto because we're uh on a station in buffalo  yes i know i understand the concept i would just like you to fix it because i love your show  oh  fix it  no i would like to address a couple of things here  hey first of all  hey hey could you goddamn canadians keep terrorists from flying into your country please  we border you we've been nice we haven't attacked you 
[03:29:30]  no i've been listening to crap all over that your president knew about it beforehand so let's not go there  well you know screw the past let's look ahead to the future and think hey canada could you goddamn watch who you're letting into your country have you heard about this  are you trying to learn me as a listener  there's all kinds of people i it's not you i'm not saying you i hear you have a baby to watch don't worry about the borders but i'm saying these canadians jesus christ  i throw us a bone  we could go up there at any time and take that whole tundra  from you 
[03:30:00]  no no hey hey  and mexico  i have no qualms with admitting that our military  united states of hemisphere  that's what it would be  our military is the equivalent of the boy scouts  i'm very well  i understand that  well just keep an eye on that okay laura  and you  talk to your freaking president apparently he knew about this crap right  well who didn't  be nice to her man they got great strip clubs  that's not what i was calling for  i was calling for good things so let's not go there okay  you're like the gook  i was calling to say  a lot of asian dancers up there  i like the false advertising opie where they show the american girls or the canadian girls dancing on the posters out in front of the club 
[03:30:30]  you go in it looks like the ho chi minh trail  i hate that  laurie what are you what  well first of all i want to say opie you stop feeling bad right now  can i tell you something i could easily get myself out of this a little bit  and i could act like i feel bad i don't feel bad  i'm glad  that's what it is  you're starting to sound like a radio station  there you go  thank you canada  that's all the purpose  well who else listens to you come on  it's the macabre sense of humor that we're going for 
[03:31:00]  so  number one i missed it last night  and typically i stay in my van drive around for an extra half hour just to listen to your show  because i can't get it in the house  so i missed you guys  laurie what  yes  damn  laurie  laurie  you there  can you hear her joe  i can hear you  laurie  who's who's what  did she have  yeah i think laurie hung up  yeah  no i'm here i'm here i'm here can you hear me 
[03:31:30]  anyway anthony  yeah so you were saying you could actually get out of that if you wanted to but you know  she really cut me off  was she the first canadian call we've ever had we could have got her down here we could have flown her down  yeah  it's so weird we're on in toronto but that girl man she was a twat  she was awful  well they get the uh they get the station from what buffalo  uh yeah wbuf  yeah  they're all right some of them that we listen to  they're saying she's still on the line laurie  i'm still on the line  hello  hello  i'm on the line 
[03:32:00]  and who needs to hear her for the next 10 minutes  i want that and you know if you're gonna call from somebody uh somewhere don't have a your baby  whining in the background  she didn't even get my bernardo's reference  probably some ugly little flaphead kid  who needs that  anyway  the uh  oh  she just hung up  oh my god  ah that's funny gag  it's reverse silent treatment  dopey canuck  oh we love laurie  of course  look  see laurie now you're one of these 
[03:32:30]  ah let me give her the old fist on the chin  the old you're a good egg chin tap  we got you  we got you  you little canadian goose  give her a tussle and say thanks for being a good sport  here's a little tussle  and i'll do it on top of your head too  give her a quick spank on the ass and tell her to move on  everything's okay  everything's okie dokie  tussle along toots  carl is out of the relationship and paul's in jail  let's hear you say montreal  montreal  we love you quebec  quebec 
[03:33:00]  we're not on in quebec  i know that  i say that they kept them from seceding  yeah there you go  pay attention to canadian news  have a little geopolitical conversation here right now  i was hoping  jimmy  maybe mike tyson could get involved  hey  greg what's going on  how you guys doing tonight  hey  hey i wanted to vote for the grossest moment in the history of cringe radio  it had to be sandy kane when you guys brought the doctor in  and he looked at her genital warts that was growing around on the other side 
[03:33:30]  dude dude  you see you're going to start a whole snowball rolling that we don't want to do  it's not the grossest moment and that wasn't cringe  you've got to understand what cringe is  dude i almost yanked man  you know what  cringe is  is uh the time paulo from the run of fez show came in and made out with twatto  yeah that was a cringe moment  that's cringy  right  oh my god  but not because it was disgusting  it was just a very uncomfortable and  cringe is  you don't want to listen 
[03:34:00]  you feel like you have to for some reason  cringe is  cringe is when you're listening to the show and  you make that movement toward your dial about ten times  like i gotta turn this off  but you  you stop yourself at the last second  and like oh god  and then you turn it down  but it's still loud enough that you can kind of hear  that's  that's  that's cringe  yeah  for me cringe is like  during  like even though the gross stuff doesn't do it for me  it's  but i'll look across the console  and hope  and think  what is it about him  that makes me want to be his friend  why do i like this guy

Because this wasn't  on our show  Ron and Fez's show  When Opie told  the stripper  she looked like  Joey Ramone  and she left here  crying  Well, I think  Ron and Fez  would lend us  the tape  That was a horrific 
[03:50:00]  moment  She wasn't even  a stripper  She was a dominatrix  Yeah, I made  a dominatrix cry  I didn't know  Someone who can  dish it out  and can't take it  Opie  Who, me?

[03:51:30]  click of a camera  and just completely  lost it  It ruined the show  It really did  and then we had  to destroy the chip  that came out  of the camera  because Jay was  so scared  and pissed off  I guess he got  over that after a while  because all I know  is I saw stuff  through this very  window behind me  Oh my god  Velvet  Velvet  That black  stripper woman  that we had  in here named Velvet  Yeah, the kid's  got to be two by now  Joey Fats
