<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between segments.  It began with a discussion of offensive World War II-era anti-Japanese propaganda songs, such as "Remember Pearl Harbor" and "Gonna Have to Slap the Dirty Little Jap," prompting commentary on the contrast between then and now regarding acceptable levels of racism and jingoism in media.  This led into a broader discussion of political correctness in media coverage of war and terrorism, specifically mentioning Fox News's use of "homicide bomber," and airport security.  Listener-submitted audio, including old, racially charged cigarette commercials, further fueled this discussion.  Two callers, John and Al,  phoned in to discuss their humorous musical parody of *Silence of the Lambs*. A public service announcement about the dangers of acid was mentioned but not played in full.

Anthony then launched into a rambling story about a bad acid trip in San Francisco, vividly recounting a hallucination where he mistook a hot dog for his friend Terry's penis, which then appeared to have a face and screamed when Anthony attempted to eat it. This bizarre anecdote segued into a discussion of other drug experiences, including Anthony's mescaline trip while seeing Van Halen.  This was followed by a pre-recorded phone call with William Shatner.  The hosts initially pretended to be unfamiliar with Shatner before playing clips of his spoken-word recordings of songs like "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and "Mr. Tambourine Man." The conversation covered Shatner's musical career, his album "Has Been," and his role in *Boston Legal*, with much playful antagonism between the hosts and Shatner.  "Sex Bagel" Eric conducted a street interview with a Tony Danza fan, who agreed to perform a favor for Danza in exchange for a backstage pass. Jim Norton was present throughout this portion and participated in the discussions.

A significant portion of the show revolved around a prank involving a fake interview with a "Tony Danza show" audience member. Anthony, impersonating Danza, conducted a phone interview with a woman, while Eric was sent to conduct an in-person interview with the same woman. The prank was discovered by the Tony Danza show's head of security, who physically prevented Eric from making further calls, confiscating his phone. This resulted in a chaotic sequence of events, with Eric attempting to flee, the hosts providing commentary and instructions, and much speculation about the security guard's actions and possible legal ramifications.  Crude jokes and comments were made throughout this segment. Eric eventually returned to the studio, recounting his altercation. A caller, "Corinne" or "Donkey Sausage," called in to discuss past interactions with Opie and Anthony. Jim Norton also read excerpts from a book titled "Rent Boys" as punishment for an intern who had brought the wrong brand of coffee.

Further segments included Jim Norton recounting embarrassing childhood bowel control issues, potentially linking them to possible, though un-remembered, childhood sexual abuse. This transitioned into a segment about Frankie Blue, their former station's program director at WNEW.  Audio clips were played of an intoxicated Frankie Blue broadcasting a radio show, slurring his words, mispronouncing the station's call letters, and making inappropriate comments, followed by a discussion of his subsequent firing.  The show concluded with a discussion of a successful publicity stunt involving large signs shown during a Good Morning America broadcast.  The hosts were in different locations (Jim Norton in Los Angeles, Anthony on a cruise, and Opie's location unspecified) but connected via MiFi.  The audio of Frankie Blue's on-air meltdown was a substantial part of the broadcast, interspersed with song snippets, including Donna Summer's "Last Dance."  The show also included a phone call from a concerned mother about her son quitting prostitution and suggesting he take up exercise instead, followed by a comedic bit featuring a caller impersonating Ronald Reagan making sexually suggestive comments while calling a gift shop to inquire about Nancy Reagan.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  You can fucking bet April 29, 30, because April 26 is when I film HBO in New York.  Oh.  And we're going to get all kinds of contact and ticket information, so hopefully you can make it.  Yeah, they'll make it.  I'll be there.  In the meantime, it's WW2 Propaganda Audio, including the song, Gonna Have to Slap the Dirty Little Jap.  Remember that, eh?  Of course.  It's the worst.  That won't be an Anthony.  Anthony, we've got some propaganda audio.  So, yes.  This was the stuff to rally the troops, rally the nation. 
[00:03:30]  Back in the olden days.  It was heard on regular radio.  Back when they smoked luckies.  That was a really funny bit.  So, the first song we're going to hear is Remember Pearl Harbor, better known as Wipe the Jap from the Mat.  Can you imagine if we did this today?  The outrage that would be out there?  Why can't we put out an Iraqi song where we sing about how we've got to, you know, kill the towel heads?  Because these were popular songs. 
[00:04:00]  These weren't just niche things that were recorded that people were like, oh, that's awful.  This rallied the nation.  There's one from the Andrews sisters.  See?  Very popular.  Didn't get much bigger than that back in the day.  And they have a song called You're a Sap, Mr. Jap.  So many things rhymed with Jap back then.  So easy to write a song.  You're a Sap, Mr. Jap.  All right.  Let's listen to just a piece of Remember Pearl Harbor.  Wipe the Jap from the Mat. 
[00:04:30]  Remember Pearl Harbor  When you psyched down the bale of your gun.  Remember Pearl Harbor  Never stopped till you dropped every one.  Give them bom for bom.  Give them shell for shell. 
[00:05:00]  Fill a hundred laps for every boy that fell.  Remember Pearl Harbor  Wipe the Jap from the Mat.  Give them hell.  Brush, brush, brush your teeth.  Brush, oh, sorry.  Sounded like that.  Down in the sun in the morning  Down on the wide blue sea  Hawaii  Isle of sunshine  Lay so peacefully 
[00:05:30]  Then from the sky without warning  The vultures swarmed to attack  Hiding behind their peace talk  They stabbed our boys in the back  Remember Pearl Harbor  Every hour, every day that we live  Remember Pearl Harbor  And the crime we can never forgive 
[00:06:00]  Through the sweat and fall  Through the blood and tears  Keep this battle cry  Ringing in our ears  Remember Pearl Harbor  Let the song keep us strong  Through the years  All right, enough of that.  Remember Hiroshima  Yeah, I think we won in the end.  I think I know how that turns out.  I think we persevere and remember Pearl Harbor 
[00:06:30]  and barbecue a couple hundred thousand of them.  A little more than that.  Yeah, a little more than that.  So, it's just amazing.  I mean, if you had these type of songs today  All the outrage.  I know.  You should do that.  All right, the next one.  Stupid insurgents.  What rhymes with insurgents?  Maybe that's why there's no songs.  Give the enemy stupid names now.  You can't, how the hell are you going to do that?  The next one, just a piece.  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap? 
[00:07:00]  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  Of course he is.  Written by Bob Miller.  Performed by Carson Robinson.  By Carson Rob...  Typo, hopefully.  Who wrote Slap the Little Jap?  Ed Norton?  They were good.  I remember they opened...  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah!  We'll skin that streak of yellow from the sneaky little fella.  And he'll think the cyclone struck him when we're through it.  We'll take that double crosser to the old woodshed.  We'll start right on his bottom and we'll go to his head.  When we get done with him, he'll wish that he was dead.  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap.  Uncle Sam's a man who's given a helping hand to many a foreign land.  Don't forget it. 
[00:08:00]  But when somebody goes to tromping on his toes, they'd better guard their nose or they'll regret it.  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  The Japs and all their hooey will be changed into chop suey.  And the rising sun will set when we get through it.  Their alibi for fighting is to save their face.  For ancestors waiting in celestial space.  We'll kick their precious face down to the other place. 
[00:08:30]  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap.  Goddamn Japs.  You want to go out and get them now?  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  Yes, sir.  I wouldn't fool you, mister.  He can raise an awful blister.  And somebody's pants will burn before we're through it.  We'll reach across the ocean and grab that yellow Jap.  And turn him upside down right on democracy's lap. 
[00:09:00]  We'll blister his axis and do it with a snap.  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap.  Uncle Sam is mild, as peaceful as a child.  But never get him wild or you will rue it.  So now they want to fight.  Well, they've bit off quite a bite.  And Uncle Sam is going to make them chew it.  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  All right, you get the idea there. 
[00:09:30]  It goes on forever.  Of course it does.  I smell bit, Anthony.  I smell bit.  Yeah?  I think the listeners are talented enough to come up with some current propaganda songs.  Ah, a little few titles for Iraq?  Yeah.  We're going to have to cracky the dirty little Iraqi?  But you have to have it sung in this fun-loving way, like they did back in the day.  Back then, they could dance to that.  Lovely.  I just, I don't know.  I just loved it when we were all just openly racist. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Because we weren't even trying to hide it back then.  Who are you kidding?  We're all racist.  Every single person that listens to this program has racism in their blood.  And I don't care if you're a black guy listening, a white guy, a trucker, a mom, a dirty little Jap, or even a dirty little Jap.  We are all racist.  The problem is that we just make believe we're not nowadays.  Back then, it was open.  People didn't care.  Man, I used to hang out at the Legion with my dad when he was alive. 
[00:10:30]  And, man, these guys would just trash each other.  Of course.  There was a Jewish guy there, a black guy there, a Polish guy, an Irish guy, an Italian.  And these guys would just go at each other's throats.  They all walked into a bar.  Yeah, they had the best racist jokes that they just would pound each other with.  Yep.  Pound each other.  And my dad explained, this is just how it was when he was growing up.  Yeah.  The good old days when the Klan just hated colors.  Remember that?  They expanded.  I remember, uh, what?  See, that's, but that's the problem. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  The bell is the problem?  But back then, no one hid behind political correctness.  Everyone was just openly racist.  Even in war now, you can't be racist, which is hysterical.  You're over there, you're killing people, which is good, but you should at least, you know,  be allowed to write little ditties like this.  Yeah.  They did it back then.  You know, the Japs came over and bombed Pearl Harbor, and they wrote some songs about it.  And, uh, you know, it wasn't like, that nice little Asian gentleman needs a talking to. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  No, it was, you know, gotta slap the dirty little Japs.  Well, we have to be careful with the coverage.  We were talking about this, uh, a while ago, but it was brought up on TV the other day,  another suicide bomber.  Yes.  They had a big story about another suicide bomber, and, no, it's called a...  Yeah.  Homicide bomber is what Fox News calls them.  No.  Are you serious?  Because they don't want to put the focus on the bomber.  They want to put the focus on the people that were killed.  So instead of calling it a suicide bomber, they call it a homicide bomber. 
[00:12:00]  But meanwhile, any bombing that kills someone is a homicide bombing, whether the guy plants  the bomb and runs away or straps it to his body and dies.  The thing that separates it is the fact that the suicide bomber is blowing himself up.  So a homicide bombing means nothing.  A roadside bombing is a homicide bombing if it kills somebody.  Fox News, trying to be politically correct, trying to alter your viewpoint a little bit.  They don't call, they don't call, uh, Marine snipers snipers on Fox News. 
[00:12:30]  They're called sharpshooters.  Yeah.  Because sniper, uh, has bad, uh, uh, stigma to it.  And they don't call them terrorists, they call them freedom fighters or something.  Well, some of them do, uh, but maybe Al Jazeera.  Who calls them freedom fighters?  I don't know.  They call, they don't call them terrorists, they call them, uh, something.  I, uh, I'll get back to you on that.  I'll get back to you on that one.  Uh, ugh.  Well, you know, you go in the airport, you get checked by, by Arabs are checking me.  Really? 
[00:13:00]  You know, you've never seen at the airport?  Oh, I've seen that, yeah.  You know, they're checking me to see if they have it, you know, what they're going to do.  So, yeah, it's, it's, it's, uh, we were in L.A. in the airport, they had a sign in American,  and then they had a sign under it in Arabic.  Why?  I'm not lying, a big, you know, whatever, don't do this, do that, in Arabic, an American.  That was good.  Anyone that reads it, you can see who's looking at it and sweep them right up.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Take them to the back and work them over with a phone book.  Yeah, whose eyes are going from left to right?  Yeah.  See whose eyes are going from right to left. 
[00:13:30]  Or how do they read?  Reading that drivel.  Well, ugh, how do you read that?  It's backwards, right?  Oh, they're all backwards.  It's right to left, starting from the bottom, working their way up.  I don't know.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And then we'll get back to more of these songs.  We've got a few others.  We've got You're a Sap, Mr. Jap.  I like that sap thing.  And, uh, and Goodbye Mama, I'm Off to Yokohama.  You could use that one.  Goodbye Mama, I'm Hunting Osama.  There you go.  Something like that. 
[00:14:00]  I'm feeling a bit, though.  I'm smelling it.  I'm smelling the bit.  What is Patty doing here?  Brand new propaganda songs.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Wouldn't ya?  Wouldn't ya?  Wouldn't ya?  Wouldn't ya?  I love this.  Silence of the Lambs.  The musical.  Two guys, geniuses, in my mind.  I see these guys as geniuses.  Decided to take Silence of the Lambs and make a musical about it.  You'd think that wouldn't work, wouldn't ya?  Wouldn't ya?  Wouldn't ya?  Wouldn't ya?  But, uh, it does.  Very talented.  And a lot of people have emailed me about this bit. 
[00:14:30]  I think you get the CD, Silence of the Lambs, the musical, on foundrymusic.com.  Ooh.  Huh?  Oh?  Huh?  But this was the day we debuted the whole damn thing.  The worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Hey, who's this?  This is John and Al.  John and Al?  Yeah, we're both here.  Hi, guys.  You guys are calling from California?  Yep.  So it's like 6.40.  Sorry to wake you. 
[00:15:00]  Whatever you guys are doing there, man.  But, uh, this Silence of the Lambs, the musical, is freaking hilarious.  You gotta tell us a little bit about it.  All right.  Um, we wrote it about.  Hey, I can recognize the voice.  Yeah, you did Buffalo Bill, didn't you?  You did Buffalo Bill.  Hey, guess a little Buffalo Bill.  Would you have me?  God, I feel like I'm talking to a big-time celebrity now.  That's right.  Dude, we're all humming your songs.  In the truck.  How about, was she a great big fat person?  Was she a great big fat person? 
[00:15:30]  Very cool.  So why did you guys decide to make this?  Well, obviously, I mean, it's a hit, but.  We just did it for fun, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, we know that.  Basically, uh, we saw that there was a song in Singing in the Rain called Would You, and  that's one of our favorite Buffalo Bill lines.  Would you?  Like, for years, we'd go, would you?  So we had, like, an idea for, like, five or six songs within a minute, and then we just  did it.  What kind of musical background you got?  Uh, we have composition degrees from USC. 
[00:16:00]  Really?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Where'd you get the, you made all the music and everything?  Yeah, we did it all in our apartment.  All in your apartment?  Just you guys, or did you have, like, uh, orchestras?  No.  It sounds really good.  It's all us, and we had a woman sing on the chorus, but that's it.  It's great.  It's really great.  We can't get enough of this thing.  Are you selling this, or?  Uh, until they shut you down?  We had it online, like, for, like, a year and a half for free, and, like, lost a lot 
[00:16:30]  of money with people just downloading it, but that's basically what we wanted.  Yeah.  And now we sell it just to try and make some of the money back.  Basically, we're breaking even, because we still have it online, and it costs, like,  80 bucks a month.  Where can they get the, uh, where can they get it online?  Uh, silencethemusical.com.  Was it one of your favorite movies?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What's your favorite song off this day?  That's a good one.  Uh, the Lotion Song.  Yeah, obviously.  Yeah, that's the hit, man.  That one is just too goddamn funny.  That's your Welcome to the Jungle. 
[00:17:00]  Fantastic.  Well, we also like Are You About a Size 14?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one, too.  Sure.  And, uh, well, If I Could Smell Her Sea is pretty good.  We played that one, because we're on satellite radio.  Oh, yeah.  Any, uh, any other movies that you thought about doing this to?  Uh, Robocop.  That would be funny.  And Spartacus, but...  We shall see.  Cool.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, we just want to say hi to you guys, because we've been having a lot of fun with this, uh,  song in the last week or so.  And we're going to link you guys to our website, so. 
[00:17:30]  Would you?  It's fucking hard.  Hey, what was that song?  I'm crying over you, crying...  You know the song in the background that he's tucking his dick between his legs and dancing to?  Oh, yeah.  The real song in the movie.  Crying over you.  Yeah, it's really a hot number.  I don't know what the name of that song is.  A hot number?  Yeah.  Dirty mechanic fingernails, tweaking his own nipples.  Fuck me hard.  I love it. 
[00:18:00]  Great job, guys.  Silence the musical dot com.  What?  Yeah, these guys are half asleep.  I mean, let's be honest here.  Your website is silence the musical dot com.  People can purchase this.  Maybe a few of our listeners should purchase it, please.  I know our fans are, you know, internet savvy, but someone throw some money at these guys.  I'll just tape it off the fucking radio.  Fuck these guys.  I hope that they go for all...  Put the fucking money in the PayPal. 
[00:18:30]  All right, if you guys got anything else you want us to play on the radio, just contact Steve, okay?  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  You guys rock.  Thanks, guys.  See you later.  There they go, John and Al.  Very funny.  Very funny.  A couple of artistes.  A couple of artistes.  They're just hanging out there in California.  How long ago did they do that?  Like what?  About a year and a half ago.  About a year and a half ago?  Are they still in school?  No, they're both...  They're working at some place that has to do with film composition. 
[00:19:00]  What are they together so early in the morning for?  They're brothers.  Doing goofs on musical.  Oh, they're brothers.  They're brothers.  Okay, I was thinking maybe there was a lava thing going on there.  He's my lava.  Put your fucking dick in my asshole.  Put your fucking cock in my funky treasure.  The virus is now free.  I'm an ass.  Because nobody would pay for a virus.  You better recognize this is the worst of O&A. 
[00:19:30]  Opie and Anthony in the XM food chain are somewhere between the CEO and the lady who cleans the urinals.  Opie and Anthony are finally free on XM 202 High Voltage.  Thank you.  Satellite Radio. 
[00:20:00]  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another Opie and Anthony in Rockland.  Opie and Anthony.  A lot of fans have followed you from Stinky FM to XM.  And how have they reacted to the entire XM platform?  Well, they haven't checked out any of the other stations yet.  They're so loyal to us.  They just listen to us 24 hours a day.  So I guess we should tell them there are other fine channels on this thing they call XM.  Yeah, they could switch over.  Hear some music maybe. 
[00:20:30]  Maybe some other comedy that isn't us.  Sure.  Have fun with it.  They've been pretty cool.  I think they got a big kick out of the language, you know, the freedom you get to say certain words or just content and stuff.  So they were pretty happy with that.  I don't think it's that big a change, though, as far as the show goes on the whole.  You get pretty familiar with it.  Nothing really big.  Not that big a change.  Did you just go for a serious answer to a question?  No.  That was a very serious answer.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to.  It's a valid point.  We don't really care what our listeners think. 
[00:21:00]  That's true.  You don't even care what anyone thinks in this room.  It's all about you.  I just care about how late that clock is ticking.  We've actually lost a lot of listeners to the 80s channel and Bob Edwards.  Dr. Laura and Art Noss are going to do a little cross-promotion.  Have you seen Bob Edwards?  We're going to vomit.  Have you seen Bob Edwards?  Tell me he doesn't have something in his closet waiting to pop out.  Yeah.  And they talk about us.  He does.  Bob Edwards Gacy.  I'll tell you what he's got.  He's got a clown outfit in his closet. 
[00:21:30]  He walks around that Washington facility like a ghoul.  But I'm not on the air.  I like to paint.  He's like a late night horror show host.  That's right.  Someone go to his house immediately and dig up his backyard.  He does a one hour show because it's hard to get radio equipment into a crawl space.  Yeah, how does he get the deal?  He's on one hour day.  I found that out today.  One hour day with nine producers.  Yeah, nine producers.  And he goes home.  And coming up later tonight, creature from the Black Lagoon. 
[00:22:00]  Tune in to the Bob Edwards horror show.  Boom.  Opie and Anthony are finally free.  That's the strength of our country.  Yay!  Now, back to the roast of Opie and Anthony.  Ah, yes.  We go to the well a second time, right, Anthony?  Of course we do.  This is Anthony doing Tony Danza.  The well.  As a listener, stands online waiting to get into the Tony Danza show. 
[00:22:30]  It's the worst.  Anthony.  Well, Anthony, we got Sex Bagel on the line.  We don't want to say where he is because it could ruin what we're about to do.  What's his name?  It's not up there.  Sex Bagel.  He works for us.  Who?  Eric.  He works on the show.  Oh, Eric?  Yeah.  You know Eric.  I didn't know.  It's not up on the board.  Eric?  Yeah, I'm here.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I have a lady right here.  Not only is she a huge Tony Danza fan, she was telling me that she used to be on the 
[00:23:00]  Family Feud back in when?  1993.  1993.  Did you score big?  We did talk shows and we won over $18,000.  They won over $18,000 on the Family Feud.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  One minute.  Did you tell her that we're thinking about putting her on the Tony Danza show today?  Yes, I did.  And they're all excited.  Her and her family is right here.  They're just waiting to speak to Tony.  All right.  And where is she from?  I'm sorry.  Where are you from?  We are from New Jersey.  Surgeonsville.  They're from Surgeonsville, New Jersey. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  And what's her name?  Her name is Joan.  I'm going to give her the phone right now.  Just get Tony ready.  Hey, let me get into my Tony character.  All right.  Let's get Joan on the phone here.  Okay.  Here's Joan.  Yeah, he's right on the phone.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, Joan.  How are you doing?  I'm doing fine.  We can't wait to come inside and see you in person.  Well, I can't wait to have you on the show.  Thank you.  I mean, we watch it every day.  We love it.  I especially like the food in particular. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, you like the cooking segments.  I do.  I like the food segments.  Well, you know, I love to cook.  Being Italian, you know, I cook a lot at home.  Uh-huh.  And my kids, they get involved.  And I think it's something a lot of people like, you know?  Oh, you know what?  I have a great recipe for spaghetti and clams, the white sauce.  Spaghetti and clams.  That's my favorite.  Well, you know, I'll send you the recipe.  You got a fantastic recipe for that. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, I'll send it to you.  You know something?  Hey, one day I would love to have you maybe come on the show as, you know, a listener cooking  segment or a viewer cooking segment.  Oops.  Oh, I'd love to.  I'd love to.  And we could have you cook your special.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Actually, you know, if you ever come over to New Jersey, you can come out to Surgeonsville.  We live way out in the country.  And it's a beautiful area close to the Delaware River. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, you have a nice place out there?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, we'll cook your spaghetti and clams first.  You might as well taste it before it's aired.  Yeah, I should taste it first.  I like taking a little taste before I dip in.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how long have you been a fan?  You remember me from taxi?  I'm sorry, Tandy.  I couldn't understand that.  Hey, you remember me from my old days in taxi?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We've been following your career. 
[00:25:30]  You know, I know that you do shows in Atlantic City.  We're about two hours away from Atlantic City.  Oh, two hours.  So, you go there a lot?  Say that again?  So, you go to Atlantic City a lot?  Oh, yes.  Oh, I love going there.  The gambling.  Oh, yeah.  Wars, yeah.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  You all get on the big loser bus and take that down there?  Yeah, yeah.  Fantastic.  It's great.  Are you going to be in Atlantic City soon? 
[00:26:00]  Well, yeah.  You know, I got my album, so I like to sing.  And I go down there to Tropicana.  And I get up there and, you know, I whine and the robes give me money.  It's fantastic.  Oh, wonderful.  Wonderful.  Well, I have a cousin who happens to own a condo right on the boardwalk at the end of  the casino.  And it is just fabulous to go and visit him.  That sounds fantastic.  Yes.  You know something? 
[00:26:30]  What?  You sound like a big Tony Danza fan.  I am the biggest Tony Danza fan.  So, I want to do something a little special for you.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Here it comes, kids.  Hold on to your hats.  Okay.  I need a little relaxation before the show.  You know, it's a stressful situation being out there.  I'm kind of new to the talk show thing.  You understand?  Yes.  So, I'm thinking I could use a little company in the dressing room.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:27:00]  How would you like to come backstage and hang out with me while I get ready for the show?  I would love it.  I would love it.  Do I bring my family?  Me.  Excuse me?  Just me or do I bring the three people I came with?  Well, who do you have with you?  My husband is here and my two friends, Karen and Phyllis.  Your husband's there?  Yes.  Well, that's fantastic.  Yeah.  Can you see where this is going?  I can. 
[00:27:30]  Now, I'd like you.  You know something?  Bring the whole family with you.  Oh, thank you.  Backstage to hang out with me before the show because I need to relax a little bit.  Okay.  Great.  That's great.  Well, you are just so special to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I love being special.  And you know what relaxes me?  What's that?  I love to relax with you.  Strap in, kids.  You know what relaxes me backstage?  Excuse me? 
[00:28:00]  You know what relaxes me backstage in my dressing room?  Sure.  A nice fucking blowjob.  Oh, my.  I'm sorry.  I missed that on the phone.  No, you didn't.  Should I?  Tony likes having his hogs sucked before I got to placate to the rubes out there.  I would never use a word like placate.  What am I, insane?  Before I entertain all the rubes out there in my audience.  Oh, okay. 
[00:28:30]  I like blowing a load on someone's face.  And you seem like that person.  Okay.  Should I give this phone to Eric so he knows what's going on?  You better give it to him so he can run as fast as he can away from your husband  when you tell him the news that you'll be backstage sucking Tony Danes' cock.  Okay.  Fantastic.  I heard what you said.  I'm going backstage, Eric. 
[00:29:00]  Okay.  Okay, here.  I'm going to give you to Eric so you can tell him what's going on.  Fantastic.  Okay.  See you soon, Tony, and thank you so much.  You certainly will.  All right.  I will come back right out.  Hey, run, Eric.  Run.  All right.  You got it?  Yeah, you can come home.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe.  Is she telling her husband right now?  That line?  I'm sorry?  Is she telling her husband right now?  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:30]  They're jumping up and down.  I think she was so starstruck she had no clue that what I was saying.  All right.  Ask her if she understands what's going on.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me move back.  They're moving the line.  Hold on.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, you're going to kill me.  John, she just wanted me to ask you.  Do you guys understand what's going on and everything, right, about what he said?  About the backstage and all that?  Just be there.  Just be there?  Yes.  Yes, she understands.  Okay.  Does she understand what she has to do to Tony, though?  You understand what you have to do for Tony, right? 
[00:30:00]  She doesn't...  I was having trouble hearing you.  She was having trouble hearing.  She just said to tell her if she can't what.  You want me to tell you?  Yes.  All right.  What does Tony want her to do?  I think that Tony should tell her.  Maybe Tony should tell her.  Yeah, Tony should tell her.  Tony wants to tell her?  Okay.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Tony loves you.  You can't get enough of him.  Okay.  I'm going to try to hear out here.  All right, Joan.  You listening?  Yeah, I'm listening.  Look, I need you to come backstage before the show and give Tony Danza, myself, some oral 
[00:30:30]  favors.  Some oral favors?  Is that what you said?  What did you say?  You heard me right, honey.  Party favors?  No, not party favors.  I need oral treats before the show to get me loosened up, and I pick a broad online  every day.  Eric finds a broad that can give me oral favors. 
[00:31:00]  Eric is telling me I have to blow out those party favor things.  No, he's saying a blow job.  Yeah.  I know what you're talking about.  I understand what you're saying.  Do you get it now?  I get it now.  Joan Jones, suck on my bone.  And you're not going to get this on television saying that?  No, no, no.  The Tony Danza on TV's got to be all nice. 
[00:31:30]  The one backstage makes you choke.  She can't hear me right now.  She can't hear me right now.  Get her to run up on stage during the show.  All righty.  All right.  There's two Tony Danzas.  Also, I'm going to introduce you during the show.  Okay, that's good.  So, actually, I can't say your name.  That's all right.  But right after I say extravadanza, I want you to run up on stage and join me. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Absolutely.  I need a big hug from you.  Okay.  Right after I say extravadanza in the audience, everyone yells it out for the big prize money.  Yes.  And I'm going to present you with $10,000 for helping me out.  Oh, you're kidding.  So, all you've got to do right after extravadanza.  I run up just as though, I mean, no one introduces me, so I just look like.  No, you're going to look like a crazed fan, but I'm going to put my arms around you.  I'm going to introduce you to the crowd. 
[00:32:30]  Okay.  And, you know, it's for, you know, Disney, the Visa, and extravadanza.  Oh, I can do that.  And don't, you know, you can tell your family and stuff, but we want to keep it secret from  the audience.  Okay.  Okay, that's it.  All right, Joan.  I will not be shy.  And I'll see you right after the show.  Okay.  Thank you, Toby.  Take care.  Thank you, Joan.  It's my pleasure.  No, my pleasure.  Okay, I'm going to give it to Eric. 
[00:33:00]  Give the phone to Eric.  Okay.  All right, Eric, here's the deal.  You've got to, like, convince her.  So, tell her, you know what you have to do.  When Tony says extravaganza.  Extravaganza, I'm sorry.  Extravaganza.  Extravaganza.  She has to run from the crowd and run on stage and hug Tony.  And if she does that, she gets $10,000, but she can't tell anyone it's happening.  She's got to wait five seconds for the graphics to show.  She's got to wait five seconds.  Well, no, by the time she gets up there.  Oh, they'll go right back.  Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah, it'll be crazy.  Okay. 
[00:33:30]  Eric, try to sell that, all right?  And then get out of there.  All right.  Be as serious as possible.  And no one is supposed to know.  Tell her.  Okay.  That's a new bit.  But don't make it, like, too much of a secret where she's going to be on to it.  Just reinforce what I said.  All right.  All right.  And Tony approved this, right?  Of course Tony did.  Yeah.  Of course.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  They're just reiterating to me, you know what to do during the extravaganza when the graphic  comes up?  Because he loves giving away other people's money.  You know that, right?  So when he does extravaganza, the graphics go up, and she's up there doing the Plinko thing. 
[00:34:00]  You know what to do, right?  You go up there and give them...  And Tony's cool with it?  Mm-hmm.  And she's all excited.  All right.  Great.  Okay?  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  You go inside, you warm up, and you have a good time with the show, and we're going to  get you backstage, all right?  Okay.  We're good.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  We'll see you in a little while.  Bye.  Holy ass.  Oh, if I'm watching that later and this broad does this, I'm going to crap myself.  That's just too easy.  I will crap myself.  They just are so thrilled to death that they are talking with Tony Danza that he could say anything 
[00:34:30]  to these people.  Anything.  All right.  Oh, that was so funny.  Oh, please, God.  Let that work.  Greg from Bloomfield.  Oh, man.  You jerk-offs are going to force me to watch that fucking Tony Danza show now.  Well, I hope it works.  It's an experiment.  We'll see.  It will eventually.  Eventually, it will work.  Absolutely.  If we have to send the intern out with a Tony Danza shirt, we have to have a Tony Danza  shirt made.  Who doesn't want one? 
[00:35:00]  Well, you know, I'd like one, too.  One with him in a Spider-Man suit with that luscious hog.  That was great.  All right.  Well, it's wrapping.  That was great, dude.  Here it comes.  That was really good.  Another successful Tony Danza phone call.  Can't lose.  They love Tony.  The worst of O and A.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet.  Complete with XM interloculars.  And they ain't body parts.  XM's high voltage 202. 
[00:35:30]  The virus is now free.  Yeah, sure.  I know the Opie and Anthony theme song.  One, two, three.  Opie.  Anthony.  The guy, Jim.  Opie.  Anthony.  Guy, Jim.  Opie. 
[00:36:00]  Anthony.  What's the problem?  It's better than Green Acres.  This looks like Taz's desk.  I'm out of home already.  Celebrating the first free week of O and A.  I've heard worse.  Something tells me it's not true.  Opie and Anthony interlocular.  Oh!  The legendary Black Earl from the O and A virus.  He's not only Black Earl because he's black, but because he... 
[00:36:30]  I wear all black.  All the time.  Why's that?  I like the color.  No other reason.  I like the color.  Let me see your underwear.  Here it is.  See?  Okay.  Yeah.  Black Earl is black all the way around.  Black Earl, what originally drew you to Opie and Anthony?  Funny.  Just plain funny.  And they were different and they were new guys and we always welcomed new guys.  And it was just something different.  It was just such a vibe thing.  It was like these guys are...  They're going to bring something to the table that we've never seen before and probably will 
[00:37:00]  never see again.  Especially if they get fired again.  Yeah.  Especially if they get fired again.  You're the sales guy for Opie and Anthony.  You need to sell the rest of the XM Nation on the O and A virus.  Everybody who's never heard of them or haven't heard them yet on XM, go ahead.  If you want unfiltered, uncensored, brilliant comedy, brilliant commentary, debauchery, this  is the show.  And again, unfiltered and to paraphrase another show, no spin, no nonsense. 
[00:37:30]  It's just...  It's what it is.  And it's the truth.  O and A is the truth.  For everyone who has XM and has not listened to Opie and Anthony, this is a unique and wonderful  opportunity to hear a fabulous show.  It's different.  It's edgy.  It's informative.  It's funny.  It'll probably make you barf on one occasion.  But it's just something special. 
[00:38:00]  And XM listeners are going to be in for something that's truly amazing.  Oh.  We got it all on tape, big guy.  Yay!  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Audio newsreels.  I'm going to make so much money off these assholes.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Highly underpaid.  Thank you. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, guys.  Hope you're enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're going to be back live, I think, April 11th.  Live from Boston at Bill's Bar for opening day.  Sox, Yankees.  We're doing the show from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East Coast, I believe.  I think so.  It's going to be a crazy time at Bill's Bar.  We're hoping to see a lot of you guys out there.  Maybe some old faces from our Boston days and a lot of new faces.  Wheelchair Fred.  Wheelchair Fred's going to make an appearance.  But in the meantime, you're stuck listening to the worst of. 
[00:39:00]  But I think there's some really good stuff that we've been playing the last few days.  Certainly.  This is one of my favorite bits since coming to XM Satellite Radio, I've got to tell you.  It's when Anthony went off on the whole cigarette ad thing.  Oh, right.  I remember that like it was yesterday.  I think Steve found some old cigarette ads, some old cigarette radio commercials.  And Ant just went off on a tangent.  You know, that's the beauty of doing the show with Anthony.  Sometimes you just don't know where he's going to go.  And this is one of the standout bits we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:39:30]  A brilliant improv.  Check it out.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  So, Anthony, we got the Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  Yeah.  We mentioned this earlier.  A little earlier.  The Times, they did a change.  You used to be able to have cigarette ads on television.  And even cartoon characters.  Which now, you can't have a cartoon character hawking anything now.  Or else they say you're exploiting the children, harming the children.  But back in the old days, cigarettes. 
[00:40:00]  Who was this?  Winston, I think.  Winston.  Fred and Barney.  They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back where we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack. 
[00:40:30]  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially  processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chug.  Oh, man.  The Flintstones have been brought to you by Winston. 
[00:41:00]  A Monica's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette.  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chug.  What?  Wilma, Wilma, I've got to get to the rock quarry.  Laurie, they took my throat out.  I got throat cancer from Winston cigarettes.  Barney, Barney, could you pedal the car with your feet today? 
[00:41:30]  I'm weak from the chemo.  That cartoon's hawking butts.  They show Betty, in one episode, having to fill one side of the bra with tissue because she smoked for a long time.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  I'm Betty.  Why, I'm Betty.  Oh, we're going into silly zone again.  All right.  Well, there you go. 
[00:42:00]  The Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  That's a little strange.  The voices were a little off, though, right?  Yeah, it almost sounded like fake Fred.  It sounded like...  Hey, Barney.  Yeah, it sounded like Jackie Gleason.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, that cartoon was based on the Honeymoon.  Based on the Honeymoon.  Stolen from.  I hated the Flintstones.  Stolen?  Did you?  I loved it growing up.  I hated it.  The Jetsons, too.  Hated it.  I hated the Jetsons.  Loved the Flintstones, though.  God.  I don't like Bugs Bunny because there was a viciousness to it.  Bugs was great.  Probably the best cartoons ever made were the old Warner Brothers cartoons.  But now they cut out all the violence when you see... 
[00:42:30]  Of course.  When you see Bugs Bunny now.  All those cartoons were all about the violence.  It's all about smashing people on the heads with frying pans and shooting them in the  face with shotguns.  And then they cut it to pieces now.  Nice to Bunny.  Hooray.  Smashing his face on the ground.  Oh.  I loved it.  I loved those cartoons.  Growing up, watched them all the time.  I can't believe you didn't like the whole nastiness.  Never liked them.  Bugs was just a nasty thing. 
[00:43:00]  I loved Bugs Bunny.  Oh, you did?  No, I loved them.  I thought you said you didn't like Bugs Bunny.  No, I hate the Flintstones.  I like Bugs Bunny.  I'm so confused.  No, no, Bugs Bunny was great, man.  That's the best cartoon.  It is.  Uh-oh.  F-ing idiots.  Peter from WhackBag.com.  What cigarette did Opie smoke?  Chesterfields?  No, he kicked that habit.  Right in the liver.  A lot of rumors flying around as far as this show goes.  I don't know why. 
[00:43:30]  What are you giving me, Eric?  People love Lost in Space.  Oh, okay.  I see.  All right.  Thank you.  What did you give Opie?  Just cartoon theme songs.  Oh, what is it?  What are you drinking, Ben?  A little water?  Can we get more coffee?  I'm fading.  Go on.  Get in turn.  Opie wants coffee.  Let's go.  Coffee.  All right.  Well, we have the Winston commercials, too.  You want to try a couple of these?  Yeah.  Let's hear some of these olden day commercials.  Oh, no.  This is for Newport.  Newport. 
[00:44:00]  Yo, B.  I loves the Newport.  Hey.  Hey.  Groovy.  Just give me a coffee.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  I like that, right?  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  This is just conjure up images of walking into the Copa, smoking cigarettes and drinking. 
[00:44:30]  Than any other menthol cigarette.  Walking through the back of the Copa.  Walk through the back.  I think that's about it.  Up front.  I think that's about it.  It's just a jingle.  That one's boring.  That music's great, ain't it?  And then this one's for Lucky Strike, old cigarette ads.  Lucky Strike, first again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men.  What?  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco. 
[00:45:00]  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  So round, so firm, so fully packed, so free and easy on the draw. 
[00:45:30]  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco, Lucky Strike.  And remember, collards, use your own water fountain.  Don't these just all sound?  Yes, Lucky Strike.  Smoke them without Negroes around. 
[00:46:00]  After you've run the fire hose on black people, enjoy the draw of a nice Lucky Strike.  Yes, Lucky Cigarettes.  To be enjoyed without the pain and agony of having black people around.  You could walk into a diner that doesn't serve Negroes and light up a Lucky Strike.  So after you go home and beat your wife, draw on a nice Lucky Strike. 
[00:46:30]  You'll be lucky there are no Negroes in your neighborhood.  Because you're white and live in America.  And you're free not to live near black people.  And smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Ah, the good old days.  That's wonderful.  What do you call a black guy that's smoking a cigarette?  See, you laughed.  I wanted to tell you the answer there. 
[00:47:00]  What was the answer?  I'm not saying that.  You're wrecking the timing of the bit.  You call him nicotine.  What?  That's what's in the cigarette.  Nicotine.  Oh, nicotine.  That's what I said.  Nicotine.  Nicotine.  Okay.  Enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  And enjoy your whiteness.  And the whiteness of your neighborhood.  Your family.  Your workplace.  The water fountain.  The buses.  Every place in America. 
[00:47:30]  Lucky Strike.  The official cigarette of the Send Them Back to Africa campaign.  Feel that draw.  The pleasure of smoking and living in a white country.  After you sick the German shepherds on some Negroes, enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  They're wonderful like white people.  They just all sound like that. 
[00:48:00]  You can tell it's old.  Right.  There's something about the sound you can tell.  There's just that sound of rampant racism in it.  Let's try a cigarette spot for Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair cigarettes.  Now, a cigarette that's low in tar and nicotine, high in menthol flavor.  New Montclair.  Just enough in every puff makes every puff a pleasure. 
[00:48:30]  How much is just enough?  Just enough menthol to please your taste.  Montclair's new charcoal menthol filter does it.  Charcoal granules that are both activated and mentholated release just enough menthol to freshen every puff.  So every puff tastes as good as the first puff.  What's so modern about Montclair?  Modern.  The answer is in Montclair's modern menthol flavor.  Yet Montclair is surprisingly low in tar and nicotine. 
[00:49:00]  But the flavor's still there when you smoke Montclair just enough in every puff makes every puff a pleasure.  Smoke Montclair.  New from the American Tobacco Company.  Mmm.  That sounds good.  More mellow.  Yeah, that's a mellow one.  You want another lucky strike?  We'll try one more lucky strike.  Lucky.  Places all.  All joint hand circle lift.  Now circle right and listen to me. 
[00:49:30]  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Elementary corner's like swinging on a gate.  A right to your honey with a right to your left eight.  Grand right to your left around you go.  Lucky strike means find a back goal.  Meet your honey and give her a whirl.  All swing around with your little girls.  Smoke them, smoke them.  Then you'll see.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Promenade and don't you fall.  Promenade around the hall.  Lucky strike is first again. 
[00:50:00]  First again with tobacco men.  Promenade straight down the pike.  It's time right now for a lucky strike.  Yes, first smoking that you're bound to like.  You just can't beat a lucky strike.  Yes, sir.  They're playing that chicken picking music.  I hope whoever wrote that never smoked and still got cancer.  Swing your partner to and fro.  Look around.  No black sambo. 
[00:50:30]  Ah, yes.  Lucky strike.  The wonderful flavor.  Taste the draw of lucky strike as you drop your children off at an all-white school.  No negroes here.  The only place you want charcoal is in your filter.  The charcoal filter of lucky strike.  Wonderful.  That's also the only place you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  Not walking the streets of your all-white neighborhood. 
[00:51:00]  Lucky strike.  What a wonderful cigarette.  Good for dining, dancing, or lynching.  Light up a lucky strike.  You can light it off your zippo lighter, a match, or a burning truss on a negro's lawn.  Whatever it takes, light up that lucky strike.  You know why lucky strike cigarettes are so good?  Look at them.  They're white.  That's right.  When have you ever saw a black cigarette? 
[00:51:30]  Never.  Because it couldn't possibly be good.  Lucky strike with their wonderful white paper.  Smoke luckies.  Because we don't like negroes.  There it is.  What a time.  What a time we lived in.  I think we have one more for lucky strike.  Lucky again?  I mean, no, let's try a Newport.  Another Newport ad.  These were boring, though, right? 
[00:52:00]  We didn't like the first one.  I don't know.  It's kind of jazzy.  Scooby-Doo-Wawa.  Smooth and fresh is the Newport taste.  Never harsh, never rough.  The smoothest tasting menthol cigarette.  Wah-wah.  King size and new deluxe 100s. 
[00:52:30]  Little tune written for a cigarette ad, 1936.  You think she had to kill the cigarette because it was talking to her?  That voice.  Do you notice that the menthol ads all have a cool, mellow thing?  Like that was the message that was like, you hang back and have a menthol ad.  Right.  Right.  But the other cigarettes, lucky.  Smoking lucky.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  Of course, Jersey again.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:53:00]  What's up, bitches?  Hi, John.  I don't appreciate that type of language.  I just want to tell you guys, when Anthony said he was going to stick to German Shepherds,  I almost drove into a ditch.  You guys rock.  This is the part of the program where we allow you to compliment the bit.  Oh, thank you.  I'm tearing down the third wall for everyone, Anthony.  So we could feel a little better about ourselves.  What's that?  What is that, Eric?  I have no idea.  Eric, what are you doing?  A pack of Marlboros.  You ever heard that theory that the Marlboros box was designed like the KKK thing, the hoods? 
[00:53:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's been around for years, that theory.  Yeah.  There are all kinds of rumors like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I don't think Marlboros and the hoods with the Klan.  This is the new and improved Opie and Anthony show, so we don't beat things into the ground.  We'll try not to.  We're going to say cut right there.  All right.  And end the bit.  End the bit.  Bravo to Anthony.  Bit is over.  Coming up with that on the fly.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for the musical accompaniment in there.  Derek.  The only time you want tar baby is in your cigarette. 
[00:54:00]  That was great.  Richard, Jenny, coming up.  No, I didn't live in those times.  I was saying those were some...  The guy's like, how old are you?  No, I wasn't around during those.  Yeah.  That's right.  Sure.  It's called a bit, silly.  All right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, me, Burt Lancaster. 
[00:54:30]  We would go out and smoke.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Whoa, I thought the voiceover guy was in the room with us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, look, man, I want to eat lunch.  Thank you.  This is the dropping acid PSA.  Next.  Well, you know what, though?  This is a...  I love this piece of audio, though.  It's something like hippy, trippy chick from San Francisco that was dropping acid for the  first time or something like that?  Yeah, it tells her bad experience with dropping acid, and it was supposed to teach the kids 
[00:55:00]  so they didn't do it.  This made me want to do acid.  Really?  You wanted to see a...  Oh, yeah, especially when the hot dog comes to life.  Yeah.  Don't ruin it.  Oh.  You spoiler of things.  I'm kind of feeling bad about myself now.  No, now.  They probably heard it anyway.  Yeah, that's true.  Unless you're one of these new shitheads that's just tuning in because we're off the premium  channel.  Thanks, cheapo.  Shintzy fuckers.  That's what you deserve.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  You know what, it's really early, and I think it would be very effective if we played that 
[00:55:30]  drop acid PSA right away.  Oh, yeah.  I like this one.  Well, every day we're finding stuff that we used to play on the old show.  We forgot about a lot of things because we were off the air for two years, and we weren't  able to take any of our stuff with us, so slowly but surely we're rebuilding the show.  Yeah.  And it's been kind of fun to rediscover things, you know?  I know we hadn't heard them in quite a while, didn't have them, and now they're just turning  up.  What, do people send these in, or is Eric finding them? 
[00:56:00]  Well, Eric is amazing.  Sex Bagel does a great job for the radio show.  And then the listeners are just taking it upon themselves, going, God, I can't believe  they don't have this clip and they're not playing it yet.  And they're sending in stuff all the time.  You know, we've said over the years that the Opie and Anthony show is truly the people's  radio program.  Yes.  You know, when we start sucking, you know, that's when the listeners need to do their  part.  Oh, I thought you were going to blame them.  Yeah.  Well, in a way I am.  When they start sucking, it's your fault for not sending us stuff. 
[00:56:30]  Well, they participate in the show, and, you know, sometimes we need them a little  more than usual, right?  Right.  You know, maybe today we just tell the listeners, hey, this is your show today.  What do you want to hear?  Ooh.  What do you want to do with this program today?  That's really giving them a lot of responsibility.  A lot of responsibility.  What would they ask for?  I know what these sick fucks would ask for.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of sex.  A lot of girls playing with themselves.  Which is just fine by me.  Yeah, so we got the drop acid PSA. 
[00:57:00]  I hadn't heard this in quite some time.  This was something that came out, I guess, in the early 70s, maybe?  Yeah, when they were putting out a lot of PSAs about drugs, drug use.  Can't have your kid doing drugs.  So they figured that if a young person was telling people what it was like to do drugs  and how bad it was, that maybe your kid wouldn't do drugs.  Right.  I think the scenario is this lady is kind of hanging out in San Francisco.  San Francisco.  Is Market Street in San Francisco? 
[00:57:30]  I don't even know.  Yeah, I think so, right?  Yeah?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Yeah.  Anyone?  Anyone?  My brother's giving a thumbs up, so I guess so.  So this is an example of why you shouldn't drop acid.  Right.  Because drop acid was all the rage back in the early 70s.  Dropping acid.  But they also kind of hint that marijuana might be a stepping stone.  Yeah, it starts with marijuana and ends with acid.  Acid.  So this thing made us, I don't know, laugh pretty hard this morning as we were preparing  for the show, and I think it's something you should play real early while people are still 
[00:58:00]  kind of waking up and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's kind of creepy, too, you know, the sound effects and stuff.  The bad 60s and early 70s sound effects.  Right.  Check this out.  Synthesizer.  I first dropped acid when I was 18.  I was over at these people's house one night.  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was 
[00:58:30]  curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it.  I don't know what I was waiting for, a flash or a rush or whatever, but I kept sitting there  waiting and waiting and nothing was happening.  So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green and  brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  So we tripped down to Market Street, and I decided to buy a hot dog.  She decides to buy a hot dog. 
[00:59:00]  Hippie chicken or pink capris, a little top.  Bad damn hippies.  With a little hairy armpit.  Oh, you know, she's just a mess.  Going out for a hot dog.  And she's a stringy-haired, greasy, hippie mess back then.  And she leaves the house, and she's probably not tripping that much yet.  Yeah.  Probably thinking, hey, this is not that bad after all.  It's not bad.  It's just a little stronger than marijuana, but I think I can handle myself.  I'm going to hit the streets of San Francisco and get myself a hot dog. 
[00:59:30]  My 70s Earth Mama Muff was pushing out my capris.  Right.  Big friggin' yellow pads.  Looked like I was smuggling a yo-yo in my capris.  All right, so she's stepping out to get her hot dog.  Okay.  So far, so good, right?  No problem.  She probably has the munchies from all the drug abuse.  From the pot.  There you go.  And I decided to buy a hot dog.  It's like a saucer came down. 
[01:00:00]  It was a...  Yeah, it sounds like Ed Wood.  Yeah.  Cut.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  I was very hungry.  And I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual.  And I put the hot dog up to my mouth, and somebody started screaming.  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said, did you hear 
[01:00:30]  that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said, no.  He said, don't be a bummer.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder.  That's the sound effect of a scream back in the early 70s or something?  I know.  What the hell is that?  The Moog synthesizer.  I think it would have been much more effective if it was an actual scream, the hot dog screaming  at her.  But instead, they go with the sound effects.  I backed up a little bit.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder. 
[01:01:00]  And it hit me.  No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog, and there was a face on him.  Uh-oh.  What kind of face do you think was on the hot dog?  On the hot dog.  A little smiley wiener face.  What kind of, what was it?  Then I realized it wasn't a hot dog at all.  It was my friend Terry's cock. 
[01:01:30]  I put it up to my mouth, and it spit at me.  You know Terry's having a good time, right?  He's in San Francisco.  Yeah, Terry's a professional.  Summer of love.  He's like, hey, he found a new bra.  Right.  He's thinking, hey, she can handle the acid like me.  Free love.  We'll do a little acid.  We'll go back to my pad and bang.  Yeah, we're going to eat some hot dogs, and she's going to eat my hot dog.  Right, yeah.  Under the black lights with the lava lamps rocking.  This hippie bitch is ready to screw it all up.  Jefferson Airplane playing in the background. 
[01:02:00]  White rabbit.  Right, of course it is.  This guy's like, yeah, baby.  Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, man.  But this broad is a buzz kill.  She's a bummer.  She's a real bummer.  She's seen faces in a hot dog.  In a hot dog.  The summer of love.  Come on.  She's supposed to have a good time at San Francisco in the 60s, man.  Right.  Who sees faces in a hot dog?  Except this bitch.  Von and Terry out.  Eyes, nose, a mouth. 
[01:02:30]  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  Redhead.  Right about now, Terry's like, oh, great.  Oh, boy.  Now I'm going to have to babysit this acid head.  Right.  She's having a bad trip.  I'm going to go to Haight-Asbury and see if there's any other broads that I can pick up.  Nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him.  And he had a wife and seven kids at home to support. 
[01:03:00]  And I stood there with this hot dog and asked Terry, do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  What kind of answer is that?  Hot dog's talking to me?  Nah.  Let's get out of here.  Let's screw.  Right.  Let's ball.  That's why I said, nah, let's get out of here.  He's thinking in his head.  All right, she's ready for some action.  He knows she's just going to ruin everything.  The guy gave her the acid.  So he's like, he had the acid.  Probably used to it. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Knows how to do it and have a good goddamn time doing it.  And she is just wrecking.  You know he looked over and she said the hot dog's talking and he's, oh, it's a babysitting session now.  But that's why he wants to get out of there.  He thinks he can get one in before she really cracks.  Yeah, quick, let's go back to my place.  We'll ball, man.  And then, you know, everything will be groovy.  Don't worry about it.  And then we'll crash.  Yeah.  And the hot dog admits he has a wife and seven kids.  I wonder if he spoke in a Mexican accent. 
[01:04:00]  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  He thought I was just faking.  And I told him, look at the thing.  He's got a face.  And he's screaming.  And the guy finally looked over and he got on the same trip that I was on.  Thanks.  And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog.  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating, so I put it in my mouth and bit down. 
[01:04:30]  It turns into a horror movie.  You know something?  Listen, perhaps if you're on acid and your hot dog is talking to you, even if you realize you're hallucinating and, like, you kind of talk yourself down a little bit, perhaps you should just write off eating the hot dog.  You know what I mean?  Like, you kind of reach the point where you're like, look, I'm hallucinating.  The hot dog isn't really talking to me.  Perhaps I should put the hot dog down, though, and walk away. 
[01:05:00]  Not bite it.  You will let me know if that hot dog stops screaming.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, my goodness.  I've got to hear the scream.  So it screamed.  Listen to this again.  So I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town.  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it. 
[01:05:30]  That wasn't a hot dog.  That was Terry's cock.  That was Terry screaming.  Terry screaming.  You weren't standing on Market Street.  You were back in the room.  And the hot dog only had one eye, you ass.  And you only thought it was sauerkraut because he hasn't washed his pubes in a few weeks.  Hippie dirtbag.  Relish and sauerkraut.  So I put it in my mouth and bit down.  Yeah.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town. 
[01:06:00]  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  It was about this time I realized that I forgot about the turkey in the oven at the house I was babysitting the baby at.  When I opened the oven, I was horrified.  I went back up to the crib and there was a turkey in the crib.  Where was the baby?  That old gag.  Oh, man. 
[01:06:30]  I wish I lived during the acid years.  Doesn't that sound like fun?  Sounds like a great time.  Talking hot dog.  Right.  She bit my hot dog.  Terry punched me in the face and poured hot coffee on my tits.  I realized that I had murdered it.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  And I took off screaming down the street.  Scared.  Must have been so funny to watch.  So, this chick, like, dude, you should have seen what I saw today on Market Street.  This chick, like, she was kind of hot, hippie chick, but she looked pretty fucked up.  And she's like, gets a hot dog and starts eating it.  And then, dude, she's talking to it.  She's just talking to it.  And then all of a sudden she starts jumping up and down on it, screaming and running away. 
[01:07:30]  It was great.  You should have seen it.  She freaked out.  Acid sounds great.  Yeah, it sure does.  And that's how it ends.  Her just running down the street.  Running down Market Street, screaming with hot dog on her shoe.  And I guess it's, then the PSA just said, don't do acid.  Don't do acid.  Or something like that.  Is that it?  I don't know.  They have a clever slogan?  Who knows?  I know.  I did mescaline.  That's about the only kind of acid type stuff I did.  Shrooms, bro.  Come on.  Shrooms?  Never did the shrooms.  I was a mescaline guy back, I guess when... 
[01:08:00]  Back in California?  No, no, no.  It was when Van Halen...  I forgot what Van Halen album it was.  But it was definitely David Lee Roth.  And I went to the Nassau Coliseum.  And I took some mescaline with my friends.  And we were going to watch Van Halen.  And everyone was peeking, dude.  Everyone was peeking, except me.  I'm just sitting through the concert, you know, having a good time and stuff.  And then all of a sudden, David Lee Roth started screaming.  So I went...  I was the designated driver. 
[01:08:30]  Because I wasn't...  You're the designated driver and you're on mescaline.  But I wasn't feeling anything.  Everyone else is laughing their asses up.  Because mescaline just makes you laugh at everything.  It's very funny.  And I figured, you know, I'd drive.  You know, because I drove there.  And I...  Who am I saying designated driver?  I drove there.  I was driving back regardless of how fucked up I was.  We all get to the car.  And hop in.  And it's raining.  So we start driving out of the parking lot.  And I notice the windshield wipers are starting to really get loud. 
[01:09:00]  And I'm really noticing them.  Oh, you're completely focused on them?  Oh, man.  And I couldn't stop thinking about the windshield wipers.  Was it going in slow motion, too?  It started.  Then the taillights of all the cars...  Because, you know, it was just getting out of a concert.  All you see are taillights everywhere.  And the way they were kind of...  The light of the taillight was being diffused on the drops on my windshield.  And the windshield wipers going back and forth. 
[01:09:30]  And they were kind of going in slow motion.  And now the red taillights in the wipers were making these streamer kind of stretched out red colors.  And the sound was just really getting...  With the red lights going.  And I'm sitting there.  And all of a sudden, I just started going...  And the guys in the car are like, dude, you all right?  I'm like, yeah.  Fine, man.  They're like, oh, Anthony's fucked up, man. 
[01:10:00]  Don't worry about it.  And I drove home.  It all of a sudden turns into a Cheech and John movie for you.  I was driving down the parkway.  Yeah.  And laughing.  Didn't know if I was doing 80 or 8 miles an hour.  No clue.  Had no clue.  And that was my mescaline time at Van Halen.  But, you know, that kind of stuff, if you don't let it run away on you, it's kind of fun.  It is fun until you see faces in the hot dog.  Yeah, once you start getting hot dogs telling you to have families and then biting it and it's screaming, that would freak you out a little bit. 
[01:10:30]  I know I ate glowing French fries when we went back down to the pizza place we all worked at.  And there were French fries underneath the heat lamp in the kitchen area.  And we all came back from the concert, went to the restaurant we worked at because we'd get free food.  And we went into the kitchen.  And the French fries, I started eating them off the rack up top.  It was under the heat light.  And they were glowing like Marcellus Wallace's suitcase when John Travolta opened it up. 
[01:11:00]  It glowed like that.  And I kept eating them.  And that kind of freaked me out a little bit because I thought I was going to have some kind of radiation in my stomach.  But no talking hot dog.  Just glowing French fries.  With a face and seven kids.  Seven kids.  That's hilarious.  I wasn't screaming down Jericho Turnpike with French fry on my shoe.  Well, there you have it.  The drop acid PSA.  Yeah.  You forgot all about that.  Nice.  That thing.  Groovy.  Yeah.  That was a trippy time back then, huh? 
[01:11:30]  Have some acid, baby.  Yeah.  John in New York wants in.  Hey, John.  What's up?  Yeah.  You guys are talking about this.  I'm driving in the rain with the rain blowing on my windshield.  I'm starting to go into an acid flashback.  Ah.  Do people really have flashbacks, though?  Who knows?  I don't know anyone who's ever had an acid flashback.  She probably did.  Yeah, let's go to...  Every time she eats a hot dog.  Oh, let's go to Montgomery, Alabama.  Alabama.  Robert, what's up?  Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener. 
[01:12:00]  That's what I'd really like to be.  That's what I was singing.  I love you.  All right.  There you go.  Singing right before she bit its head off with the red ketchup-y hair.  Yeah, how does ketchup turn into hair?  What does a hot dog with seven kids say?  Don't eat me.  That's what I was saying.  Freaking her out.  I'm just making my coffee.  Oh, you're almost done with your oatmeal.  I know.  Did it have a little conversation with her? 
[01:12:30]  It said, don't eat me.  I stink.  I'm a gluey mess.  I look like placenta.  Throw me out.  The replacement for nose picking.  Opie and Anthony.  Now free on the satellite.  Behave accordingly.  I'm going to break that kid's legs.  O and A.  Opie and Anthony interlocular.  Wow.  So, okay.  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another Opie and Anthony interlocular. 
[01:13:00]  The worst of O and A.  Jim, you've been on the show for the whole ride, up, down, all around.  Well, since the NAW, not the entire time, but yeah.  Since here, yeah.  What's the difference in coming from a stage and having to adjust to FM and then coming  back with total freedom of XM?  The language freedom is great.  You know, and there's less time to eat.  That wraps it up.  What's the difference in O and A 2000, O and A 2005? 
[01:13:30]  Wow.  What's the difference?  That's easier to do the show.  I know what to do.  Oh, God.  It's just, it's a little easier to touch on certain subject matter.  You know, we still do a lot of the same, you know, we have a lot of the same conversations,  stuff that guys like to talk about, but it's easier, you know?  You don't have to sit there beating around the bush for 20 minutes hoping some morons  understand what you're talking about because you've got to talk in code 20 times removed  from what you're actually talking about so you don't get in trouble.  Now we can just get on and blah, blah, blah. 
[01:14:00]  And we don't have to worry about the bosses?  Yeah.  You know, after every show that we did in 2000, we would be called into some office  or the phone would be ringing.  Boys, boys, that break was a little too long.  Well, no, not really because we were a talk show.  It was more like, I don't know.  We like that our listeners can't hear us over the phone.  That's a big difference and we're very happy with it.  They can't hear a word we're saying because it's so much better to talk and then have the  listener talk right over what you're saying.  Fantastic.  That's a big difference.  Yeah, we're on vacation right now, but when we get back, guys, our faithful 
[01:14:30]  listeners, every phone call, because they're going to spend about, I think, about a million  dollars fixed in our studio in New York City.  So when we get back live, we want all of you, when you get on the program, to say, guys,  I still can't hear you.  I still can't hear you.  It'll drive them nuts in Washington.  We're going to have like nuclear futuristic phones in this studio.  They're going to take two weeks and totally fix the studio.  Nothing should be broken.  Yeah.  So make believe you still can't hear us.  It'll drive them nothing.  I'd say the main difference between Opie and Anthony 2000 and 2005 is the equipment 
[01:15:00]  here is now behaving like they predicted it would at Y2K.  Look at Jim all proud of himself.  Just proud that he got it out.  I know.  Let him say YK2.  LOL.  It's been a long time since I've used that reference.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM202 High Voltage.  Remember the time William Shatner called in? 
[01:15:30]  My buddy Bill Shatner, as I like to call him, because his close friends call him Bill.  William is so, uh, it's too formal.  It's what rolls in the credits.  But when you're his pal, you could call him Bill Shatner, and that's what I called him.  And remember Jimmy and I tried to throw you under the bus?  How could you, my hero, on the phone, how could you try to throw me under the bus?  Well, Jimmy and I both knew that you're a huge fan of Shatner and Star Trek and stuff,  so we decided, you know what, let's make believe that, uh, Anthony just doesn't really get the  whole William Shatner thing. 
[01:16:00]  I remember that.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thanks for, thanks for helping.  Man, I can't see why it's not called Norton and Friends with that brilliant comment.  That was a good one.  I just, I, I confirmed what you said, and I did it quickly and concisely.  All right, William Shatner called in the show.  This is how it sounded.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I thought William Shatner was calling today.  Hey, what time?  Between 9.15 and 9.30.  Really?  Does he have a CD out or something? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, he does.  Do we have any songs for it?  Yeah, we have, actually, it's a pretty good song.  Yes.  Let me go get it.  William Shatner, Has Been.  Give me that bag.  Produced and arranged by Ben Folds.  How about that?  Actually, the song is pretty good.  Rock Radio is playing it.  Has Been?  Mm-hmm.  That's the album.  It's about him?  Or is it like a sarcastic statement about, I wouldn't call him a has-been.  He's still a very, very famous guy.  He's all over.  Every time you see him.  Boston Legal is incredibly funny. 
[01:17:00]  Just saw him on, uh, what, VH1 did a, did a whole 2004 thing?  Or was it Comedy Central?  I can never tell.  Yeah.  He's like, you can't call someone like that a has-been.  The guy is like Americana as far as who he is.  You can't be a has-been.  Well, usually he does like the Goop songs, Anthony, you know?  Yeah.  Like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Do we have any of that stuff?  That was years and years and years ago.  He did that, like, spoken word stuff, and he was serious when he did it.  Like, now it's pretty funny.  Now he makes me believe he wasn't serious.  Yeah.  And it's funny to have William Shatner talk on these songs. 
[01:17:30]  But back then, that was all him.  Like, really thinking this spoken word thing is going to be huge.  What's this called?  Which one is this?  Lucy in the Sky.  Oh, yeah.  Go into his studio and have the singers do all this, and then Shatner.  So he didn't do this as a goof originally?  I thought he did.  No, he was dead serious.  Oh, because now he plays it off like he was a goof the whole time.  No, this is all serious.  All right, listen to William Shatner's sing.  Very dramatic. 
[01:18:00]  Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies.  Somebody calls you.  You answer quite slowly.  A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  From Rigel 7.  Cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering over your head.  Like the gamesters of Traskelia. 
[01:18:30]  A girl with a sun in her eyes.  And she's gone.  Oh, bad echo.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  We got to play Mr. Tambourine Man.  That's the one where he's really going up.  Mr. Tambourine Man.  Mr. Tambourine Man.  More of William Shatner singing.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Bill Shatner is his friend's call.  I'm calling Bill Shatner.  If he calls in, I'm going to call him Bill Shatner like I'm his pal.  He ain't calling in.  Chuck Heston calling in too?  Chuck Heston?  Bobby De Niro, Jimmy?  We'll add him to the list of people that didn't call in.  Didn't call in?  Yeah.  Oh, Bob De Niro did SNL this week.  Yeah?  My friend got a picture with him.  Oh.  Dean.  There he goes.  Tambourine Man.  Tambourine Man.  Listen, listen.  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.  Hey. 
[01:19:30]  Tambourine Man.  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.  Play a song.  I just want to smoke hot when you get this.  Take LSD out of the village.  Sleepy.  And there is no place I'm going to. 
[01:20:00]  What is that?  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.  Play a song for me.  Hey.  In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you.  Take me on a trip.  On your magic swirling ship. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  My senses have been stripped.  My hands can't feel the grip.  My toes.  Too numb to step.  Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering.  Wandering.  Yes.  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.  I guess you get the idea, right?  Yeah.  Gaston's Law.  Okay.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard.  Yeah, and he did it not as a goof. 
[01:21:00]  It's not even funny.  It's not even interesting if it's done to be ironic.  Even then, it's not interesting.  He did that as a dramatic reading of these popular songs of the day and thought it was  going to take off, I guess.  Someone approaches him going, Bill, we love your acting style.  Why don't you do a spoken word to these songs?  And he did it.  You know, he has that delivery that's very slow and stick out.  Christopher Walken would be interesting to hear, or Nicholson seriously reading a song. 
[01:21:30]  You think?  I would like to hear that.  Walken is not funny.  It would be pretty much just like what we just heard, I think.  My Tambourine Man fire phasers.  My Tambourine Man photon torpedoes.  Anyone else notice that Big Kev is running around panicking and sweating?  Big Kev set up the William Shatner interview.  Oh, he's on the phone.  He's on the phone.  Yeah, look, guys.  They're talking about it on the radio.  Is Mr. Shatner awake yet?  Right.  I need Mr. Shatner on the phone now. 
[01:22:00]  Tell him it's someone who looks like Bert Lahr.  No, I'll accept they sound alike at this point.  Just get me someone that sounds like Bert Lahr.  I need Shatner on the phone.  Warp drive.  Come on.  We're not stupid.  Can he beam him into the studio?  He's in a panic.  He's trying to talk in a calm voice.  It's hello.  I had an interview with William Shatner.  Yes.  Yeah, you and the rest of the world.  Get in line.  His non-working nose is just flailing.  Mr. Shatner was scheduled to do an interview with Opie and Anthony.  Let's see what he says.  I'm wondering if... 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, what does he say?  With his tussleable hair.  What time?  What is he saying, Big Kev?  Is he out of the galaxy?  Why don't you admit that...  Uh-oh.  What does that mean you're working on?  Who did you just call?  I'm working on it.  Who did you call?  I'm working on it.  He called Lieutenant Uhura, who is trying to locate Captain Kirk in his quarter.  Big Kev, what seems to be the problem?  You know he's not calling.  I hope to God you have a nice bib for all the crow that's going to spill out of your mouth  when he calls in.  I'll get him.  I'll get him.  Hold on. 
[01:23:00]  Anthony to Captain Kirk.  Anthony to Captain Kirk.  Please come to the studio.  No?  That didn't get him?  Maybe he's on the planet.  Hold on.  Energize.  Is he beaming in?  No?  Damn.  I'm trying everything I know to get him.  Open a hailing frequency.  Big Kev, you look a little uncomfortable and nervous.  Is it going to happen or what?  I'm afraid I'm going to be fired.  Fired from working for free. 
[01:23:30]  I understand the joke.  But is he calling or not?  No.  Is it 9.30 yet?  It's 9.25 and a half.  9.31 and then start breaking my balls.  All right.  All right.  Well, William Shatner off his Has Been CD.  This is actually a good sounding song that, quote, regular rock radio is playing.  I'm not sleepy and there's a station I ain't going to called XM.  Let's take a listen to this, okay?  All right.  Brand new William Shatner on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:24:00]  She came from Greece.  She had a thirst for knowledge.  She studied sculpture at St. Martin's College.  That's where I caught her eye.  She told me that her dad was loaded.  I said, in that case, I'll have a rum and Coca-Cola.  She said, fine.  And in 30 seconds time, she said,  I want to live like common people.  I want to do whatever common people do. 
[01:24:30]  I want to sleep with common people.  I want to sleep with common people like you.  Well, what else could I do?  I said, I'll see what I can do.  I took her to a supermarket.  I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere.  So it started there.  I said, pretend you've got no money. 
[01:25:00]  She just laughed and said, oh, you're so funny.  I said, yeah.  Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here.  Are you sure?  You want to live like common people?  You want to see whatever common people see?  Do we have to break into the song, Anthony?  We do.  Is this really William Shatner?  She didn't understand.  Hello?  Bill?  Hold on.  Is this really William Shatner? 
[01:25:30]  Don't break into the song.  We'll just play it again.  Let's go back.  No, we'll just play it again.  We'll play it again after we speak to him.  That's crazy.  You've got to play that whole thing.  People have to know how good that record is.  We love it.  Mr. Shatner, I was telling everyone how great that song was.  We really were.  You know, the Mr. Tambourine and the Lucy in the Sky.  I'm not really sure what to think of that.  I know you recorded it a long time ago.  But this common people thing, it's a cool song.  Well, that's good. 
[01:26:00]  The Tambourine Man stuff was part of another record called Transform Man, which they're re-releasing.  But it was all part of the Transform Man was something that had to be listened to in its entirety.  If you lift a song like Tambourine Man out of it, people have got to wonder, what in heaven's name is he doing?  And I think for the time it came out, didn't it take a little maybe, you know, a little pot or something to really get the full gist of it? 
[01:26:30]  Well, that or a single malt.  But yes and no.  I have mixed feelings about the Transform Man.  I haven't heard it in some time, so I don't know how good or bad it is.  It's pretty bad, Bill.  It's pretty bad?  Yeah, I think it's just become quite humorous.  Like, people play it, and they're not, like, really trying to get into it.  I think it's really kind of a laugh.  I disagree.  I like it.  Wait a minute.  Let me argue that point. 
[01:27:00]  Sure.  Let me argue that point.  No problem.  Have you heard the whole record?  No, I never heard the whole record.  See, that's what I mean.  You're speaking from ignorance.  Yep.  I usually do.  Yeah, and it's a strident voice having no knowledge.  You know what this is?  It's like I am a race that is so below you that I am like a mere bug in intelligence.  And maybe in years and years to come, I will be intelligent enough to be able to communicate with you. 
[01:27:30]  Not if you don't do your research when you have all these millions of people that are listening to you and hanging on your every word.  I understand, Bill.  Wait a minute.  I've got to tell you, it's one of my favorite CDs.  I play it a lot.  Anthony just doesn't get it.  Mr. Shatner, this is Jim Norton, and I'm a big fan, and I happen to enjoy it, too.  And Anthony just refuses to listen to the whole thing, and I'm like, dude, you're not going to get it.  Tell me, just between us, what's the matter with Anthony?  I don't know.  I just, I found it funny, but I guess I've got to listen to the whole thing.  I told you that. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, we were trying to tell him for like 20 minutes, Mr. Shatner.  Better than that, listen to one.  Bill, if I will.  Listen to one cut.  But one whole cut, because it's a six-minute cut, rather than a three-minute cut.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a six-minute?  Well, it starts with literature and music underneath the literature, and segues into a song.  My whole idea was trying to relate the literature of the past with the literature of the present,  and using music as a bridge.  Now, whether that works or not is something else, but not to play the whole thing is to do me a disservice. 
[01:28:30]  And it's ignorant of him to, like, judge it only on that.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Judge it by having some knowledge.  I understand now completely.  Told you.  And I will listen to the entire cut.  And as we move forward, William, Bill, if I will.  Moving forward.  All right, let's move forward.  What's the whole Has Been album about?  I've only heard common people so far.  The Has Been album, first of all, it would be a great gift in this late Christmas rush 
[01:29:00]  to somebody who wanted to hear music about love and laughter and life and a piece of my heart.  Yes.  And there is a musical genius called Ben Folds who does some extraordinary work there.  And the notices on the album of Has Been have been unlike anything I've ever been associated with.  Did Ben Sparks do? 
[01:29:30]  Ben Folds.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ben Folds.  Why the name Has Been?  Why is that title?  Well, I wrote the song Has Been because I saw it attached.  I saw the words attached to my name on my way to Nashville to record the album.  How is that attached to your name?  Uh, they called me Has Been.  Now, who would do that?  You're still a pretty popular guy.  Still a, no, no, take the word pretty out.  I'm no longer pretty.  You're a popular guy. 
[01:30:00]  You're Americana.  You're a very popular guy.  Well, I, maybe.  You don't think you're still attractive to the females out there?  I'm sure you've got girls all over you all the time.  Yes, but they're over 65, and I don't think that counts.  That, that, remember that poster of you with the, uh, when you were covered in triples?  Chicks still feel like cream over that one.  I know, but, but, but we're talking about the past.  Yeah, I know.  You know, it happens.  Doesn't time just suck? 
[01:30:30]  Yes, Bill?  You've got to understand, you're going to get old, too.  No, I believe me, I know.  No, we're not making fun of that.  I understand.  We think time is a major drag.  I just think that, uh, you, you're, uh, you know, you're downplaying yourself, because  I'm sure a lot of girls are still very interested in Bill Shannon.  Maybe, but, uh, if that's the judge of popularity, I suppose it is.  Uh, the point being, I wrote a song called Has Been, and I thought it would be interesting,  maybe amusing, to, uh, to name the album that. 
[01:31:00]  I think it works.  Yeah, I mean, you have to ask me why Has Been, and that's, that's, uh, good marketing.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I, I had to ask, because I, I didn't like the idea of you painting yourself in that  light, because you're not a has-been.  Well, if I weren't, then I'm not.  Right.  And if I am, then you wouldn't ask.  Now, how about your return to television, Bill?  Uh, on, uh, on Sunday nights at, uh, Boston Legal. 
[01:31:30]  You're, uh.  On ABC at 7 at 10 o'clock.  I see a Shatner resurgence.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Now, this is your first, like, full-time TV gig since when?  What was the last one you did?  Um, probably Rescue 911.  Ooh.  Oh, we like the Rescue 911.  And T.J. Hooker?  And T.J. Hooker.  Yeah, I love that one, too.  Did you watch the, did you watch the show last night?  I don't think so.  No, we have to go to bed real early.  I know, we do stupid morning radio, so it's, uh, it's a pain in the ass to watch stuff. 
[01:32:00]  I gotta TiVo it, though.  But I, I, I.  Did you?  No, I did not watch the last night's show.  So, Bill, he doesn't, he doesn't watch Boston Legal.  In actual fact, you, you guys have never seen Boston Legal.  Yeah, but, yeah, and it's just faking it for the interview.  He's never seen Boston Legal in his life.  And I don't, I don't really appreciate him trying to kiss your ass by making believe that  he listens to Boston Legal.  I gotta say something here.  I don't want to get off on the wrong foot.  I think I'm getting off on the wrong foot with Bill Shatner here, because he's one of  my, like, I, I love this guy. 
[01:32:30]  And now these people are painting me as if I'm not, uh, quite the, the Bill Shatner fan.  As though you're an ignoramus.  Yeah.  Well, you, you don't like his music?  You don't watch him on TV?  I watch him all the time, and I, I, I, and, and say I'm pretty.  Popular.  I watch, I.  Yeah, you're the one who said he's pretty popular.  Not popular.  But, uh, the girls love him.  Yeah, but you know what I'm saying.  You did throw in that he was fairly and slightly popular.  No, I say he's huge.  And I, and I'm having a resurgence from where?  Yeah.  Well, no, I mean. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, he never went away.  Where did he say he went?  I meant on television.  I'm beginning to wonder whether this whole thing really isn't an insult.  No.  Yeah.  Anthony?  No, Bill, I'm a huge fan.  This is how you treat your heroes?  I bought, I bought every single Star Trek on DVD when, when it was put out in that  goddamn set, uh, that you had to buy, like, two episodes per disc.  Really?  It was a pain in the ass, but I bought every one because I'm a huge Bill Shatner fan.  I bought all the movies.  You've been very disrespected.  Why don't you just tell him you loved him when he hosted In Search Of, you've been extremely  rude since he called in. 
[01:33:30]  No, that was Leonard Nimoy.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the way you're treating him.  You see Leonard around a lot?  He's a good friend of mine.  Yeah.  He's a great guy, too.  I see you in those Priceline commercials, and it's hysterical.  How do you know, how do you know he's a great guy?  Yeah, exactly.  You know why?  Because it looks like you two really have a good relationship on those Priceline commercials.  And I'm just taking what I see from that.  Have you guys got a good relationship, or are you somewhat antagonistic?  We have a good relationship. 
[01:34:00]  Do you see each other outside?  No, we used to, but you know how it is.  No, how is it?  Do you really show up at his house nowadays?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Do you go to Leonard's house?  Do you go to Leonard's house for cocktails or a birthday party?  You don't, right?  Cocktails.  Actually, we do.  He does.  Yeah?  I'm hopeful he's coming to my house for Monday Night Football.  And you talk about how bad the episode of Spock's Brain was?  No, we only tell each other how good we are. 
[01:34:30]  Because that episode wasn't too good.  Spock's Brain.  Yeah, Spock's Brain.  Whenever that one comes on, I'm like, oh, that's Spock's Brain.  You see, it's that kind of detail I don't have in my fingertips.  Therefore, I don't talk about it.  You know what I mean, Anthony?  I hear you, Bill.  I know.  You've moved on.  I know.  But you've got to admit, a lot of people are still very into Star Trek.  I guess they are.  And I think it's something you should be very proud of.  Well, I am.  I'm not...  I am proud of it.  What's the opposite of proud? 
[01:35:00]  Ashamed.  I'm not ashamed.  Yeah?  For a moment there, my brain didn't work.  Any truths to the rumors of a return to Star Trek?  Yes, there's a great deal of truth.  Really?  Exactly which rumor are you...  A return to Star Trek.  And who told you this rumor?  No, no.  It's something I read on the Internet.  Yes, well...  Are you a Star Trek geek?  I wouldn't believe everything you read on the Internet.  No?  He's a Star Trek geek, William.  Are you going to maybe be on an episode of Enterprise? 
[01:35:30]  Well, not this year.  But maybe they'll ask me next year.  They had asked me to be on.  And I had suggested a price for my fee.  And they suggested maybe I shouldn't be on.  Wow.  Bill Shatner demanding the big bucks.  As well as he should.  Of course he should.  Because he's a legend.  You know what I saw the other day?  I saw that Twilight Zone episode.  Not the one everyone thinks of the man on the wing.  But the one where you're in that little diner.  And you're pulling out the little answer cards from the devil machine. 
[01:36:00]  Can you tell me why?  Yes.  They keep playing that.  Can you tell me why they do that?  I don't understand it.  Because that stuff holds up, those old Star Trek episodes.  Why?  Because you're fantastic in it.  No, no.  There's got to be something that appeals to people.  Some fear or some ability or something that appeals to people.  I think those are just great stories, all those old Twilight Zones. 
[01:36:30]  And your hair looks fantastic in it.  Say that again.  Who is that?  Sulu?  No, the guy.  I'm going to do a satellite radio network right now.  And I called you guys first to say thank you for playing the has-been and supporting the record.  Are you trying to say you have to leave?  What town are you in?  No, no, no.  Oh, all right.  I don't.  But somebody just came up to me.  I'm going to give you a little insight as to where I am. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  I'm outside a parking structure in a car on a cell phone.  Oh.  And somebody came up to me and I thought, oh, Lord, he's going to ask me to move.  And I'm talking to you and I'm on the air.  Whereas he turned out to be the guy connected with the radio satellite tour that I'm going to do.  You're not doing them all from inside the car, are you?  Of what?  You're not doing all of the interviews from inside your car, are you?  No.  Of course not.  Only the better ones. 
[01:37:30]  Now, that was an insult.  No, not really.  I cannot convey to you what a big fan I am.  Have you played any other songs from has-been on the air?  Well, I think we should start with playing Common People.  All right.  Common People has done a lot.  There's some good love songs there.  There's a terrific...  Brad Paisley sings a wonderful Western country song. 
[01:38:00]  Okay.  Why don't you try that one?  What song is it?  It's called Real.  Real.  I think it's the last song.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Real.  The last song on the album.  Bill, I saw you on the Comedy Central special.  How'd that go?  You were singing and dancing at the beginning and it was fantastic.  With seven.  Count them, seven.  Seven girls.  And you totally held your own with the...  Are you patronizing him now?  I am not.  I thought he did a fantastic job.  I am probably the biggest Bill Shatner fan ever. 
[01:38:30]  And I'm honored to be on the phone with you.  Singing and dancing with pretty girls swirling around is where the whole showbiz thing is at.  You understand that.  I totally understand.  Everybody aspires to dancing on the stage with seven beautiful girls.  Yes.  I think that's the ultimate end of all showbiz.  I think you're right, Bill.  Singing and dancing with these long-legged beautiful girls all tap dancing and kicking their heels is really where it's at. 
[01:39:00]  You are absolutely right.  I'm a huge fan.  I didn't want to get off on the wrong foot by Bill thinking, you know, I wasn't.  Well, I told you...  It's not that you're off on the wrong foot.  It's just that you're limping a little.  You're limping a little.  I like that he calls you Bill.  It's okay.  I'll answer to that.  Well, you know, Mr. Shatner, I had told him many times that he had to listen to...  Bill is okay.  All right, Bill.  Bill is okay.  He had to listen to the whole album, and he just kind of refused, and he judged it very quickly.  And that just kind of bothered me that he wasn't given the original respect that he should have. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, he really should.  And the Transform Man is the parent of a has-been.  Yes.  If I hadn't made Transform Man, I wouldn't have made a has-been.  And no insult at all, Bill, but you do understand that people have looked at Transform Man, and over time it has now become something that's more humorous.  No.  They've looked at that one or two songs and mocked that, but they haven't mocked the album. 
[01:40:00]  The album is used in schools to teach.  People have played the whole album.  Ben Folds, who we all agree is a musical genius, would not have made a has-been if it wasn't for the Transform Man, which he had heard years ago.  Joe Jackson, who sings Common People with me, heard the Transform Man years ago, wanted to be on this record.  Henry Rollins, same way.  Mm-hmm.  Matt Chamberlain, who plays drums, genius percussionist, same thing. 
[01:40:30]  So you're not taking that that Transform Man is a bit of a humorous thing?  No.  Because taking...  I didn't mean it to be humorous.  I meant it...  Well, humorous, yes.  Fun.  Entertaining.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, but, uh, I didn't mean it to be, uh, for Anthony to poke fun at it.  Yeah, because it is about literature and how it was and how it is in modern day times.  Yeah.  I'm not poking fun.  I'm just saying that that's kind of how it's looked at, I guess, when it's taken out of context. 
[01:41:00]  Anthony, we get it.  You don't like the album.  Yeah, so I told you you have to listen to the whole thing, and you're like, no, I just want to listen.  You can't just judge it by, like, a little piece of the song.  Right.  How about his live performance of Rocket Man on, was it Mike Douglas or Merv?  Oh, jeez.  That goes on.  I mean, jeez.  Yeah.  That goes on.  That goes back so many years.  Why don't we talk about what he's doing today?  I am, but I'm just bringing it up that that was kind of taken out of context, because it was one song, and that's what people saw.  Exactly. 
[01:41:30]  They asked me to sing a song, so for a gag, I sang a song like I thought Frank Sinatra would sing the song.  With the cigarette and everything?  I'm a Rocket Man.  Yeah.  I loved that.  It was supposed to be amusing at the time, not 30 years later for people to...  You've got to give it credit.  It's still amusing 30 years later.  As long as I can bring a small, sad smile to your face.  Yeah.  All right.  A small, little, small smile, and a thought, what in heaven's name is he doing? 
[01:42:00]  Thank you, Bill.  And actually, I ask the same question myself about twice a day.  What in heaven's name am I doing?  Oh, you rock.  You rock, Mr. Shatner.  Yes.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling today.  We're going to play Common People from Has Been.  All right.  And then play real Brad Paisley, who is one of the number one Western country music singers. 
[01:42:30]  You know what?  We'll give it a taste.  There's no problem with that.  And Joe Jackson is singing this song with you on Has Been Common People, right?  Exactly.  All right.  Bill, thanks for calling in.  You have been and always will be my friend.  That's your sentiment, not mine.  Take it easy, Bill.  Thank you.  Great talking to you, bud.  Right on.  There he goes, William Shatner.  I got dissed by Bill Shatner.  I apologize for piling on. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, you threw me under the bus with my hero.  Oh, how great.  Good.  And Bill Shatner.  And Big Kev, thank you.  Yes, Kev.  Big Kev.  I told you he would do it.  Bravo.  Big Kev came through.  Good job.  I really did sell you.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  I'm like, I told you, listen to the whole thing.  Left me out there hanging like a red shirt security guy, beamed down to a planet.  It was just so great when you're like, you meant that to be funny, and then the, uh, well, as soon as that semicolon after well came, I'm like, uh-huh.  You know, bastards. 
[01:43:30]  All kidding aside, listen to common people.  It's a really cool sounding song.  Yeah, it is.  It really is.  Hey, Bruce Vader.  He's going up to the big leagues.  The Boston Red Sox.  O&A return next week for a live broadcast from Boston.  It's still tough.  Come on.  Catch the virus at Bill's Bar before the socks opener.  Oh, and make sure you remove your eyes.  O&A.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony were overpaid, but, you know, then again, so it was, they are really lucky to have a job. 
[01:44:00]  The worst of O&A.  Hi, Bob Kelly.  He's one of the Opie and Anthony virus freaks, and they're coming to get him right now.  Ha ha, what's happening, man?  How do you feel O&A now on XM, and totally uncensored, totally free, you're a stand-up comedian.  How does that let you loose here on O&A?  It's fantastic.  I'm so glad they're free.  Now, I just want to know, do I get my two bucks back for the last eight months?  But, yeah, it's fantastic.  It should be free.  More people get to listen to these two gentlemen, Opie and Anthony, get more fans, and then they can take over the world. 
[01:44:30]  I think that's their plan, and be number one in the universe.  Why do you like being a part of the O&A show?  Because they have, they're the best fans in the world.  They have the best fans.  No, I'm just kidding.  They don't.  Their fans are evil, atrocious creeps, but that's why I love them.  O&A, because they're the best.  They're the best.  You get to say what you want.  They're the funniest thing on the radio.  The absolute truth.  You get to say what you want about fucking a sink.  Where else could I tell people that I fucked a sink when I was in Juvie Hall? 
[01:45:00]  Which show will I be able to tell that on?  The Today Show?  No.  The FCC and censorship on the radio.  I think that satellite radio is the new cable, you know, like cable television, man.  You finally get to hear what people really think, and creeps like me get to get on the radio, finally.  There are many terrestrial radio shows I've done and had to talk about how my mother used to hit me as a kid.  I actually told one time, I told this story when I was in Juvie Hall, I used to fuck a sink.  I get a lot of emails now about people, and they got it all wrong. 
[01:45:30]  They think I actually fucked the whole sink, or actually fucked the drain of the sink, which is physically impossible.  I actually just lied on top of the sink, put my hand on the edge of the sink, well lubricated, and then I pushed my mule inside of my hand.  And the sink, all it was, was leverage.  It was just leverage.  It was a place that I could put my hand, where it would be sturdy enough, I could just pump it.  Me pumping the hand instead of the hand pumping me. 
[01:46:00]  So it's actually like you're having sex.  They're in fucking the sink.  So please do it right.  I don't want people getting hurt trying to fuck the drain of a sink.  30 seconds, tell me about Opie and Anthony.  These two guys are actually breaking ground, making new radio, making history, along with Jim Norton.  They're actually saying how they feel about things, instead of saying what other people think they should say about stuff.  They're truth tellers.  They're prophets.  They're actually close to Jesus Christ of modern day age.  They give men what they want. 
[01:46:30]  Boobs on the highway every Wednesday.  God bless them.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  Bob Scott, you're great.  Bob Scott, you motherfucker.  It's Bob Kelly.  I'd stab you right in the neck with my fucking pencil right now.  Bob Scott, you stink.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony, on XM202.  I've got the job.  Jim Burns.  No surprise that we like to run bits into the ground on the Opie and Anthony program.  I believe this is another Tony Danzig call in. 
[01:47:00]  Yes, it is.  But this is the one where it goes horribly wrong for our own Eric.  And I think this ended the bit.  Or did it?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's awful.  Why can't I do the scary laugh?  I just run out of hair.  Because you're making it one long sound and you're going,  and you sound like a fucking wildebeest. 
[01:47:30]  It rubs lotion on its skin.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, a little surprise for everybody.  Haven't done this in a while.  Right?  No, we haven't.  And we can't tell you what it is because we want to get it done before anyone gets in trouble, right?  We've done it in the past.  So let's go to Sex Bagel out on the streets of New York City.  Sex Bagel!  Hey, guys.  I'm out here in the cold, pouring rain with a bunch of Tony Danzig fans here. 
[01:48:00]  We have Tina from Philadelphia who is a massive Tony Danzig fan.  She would love nothing more to speak to Tony.  Oh, that's wonderful.  All right.  I think Tony Danzig is ready here.  Hello?  Hello?  I think we're ready for Tina. 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  Hang on one second.  Okay.  Here we go.  Hello?  Tina.  Hi, Tony.  How are you?  Hey, how you doing, Tina?  Good.  We love you so much.  There's eight of us.  We came all the way from Philadelphia to see you.  Philadelphia.  Hey.  Hey, you know, I'm doing very well in Philadelphia.  That's great.  The show, taking off.  Getting married.  I am so very excited.  I wanted to hear your CD.  I wanted to purchase one.  Oh, you like that?  Yes.  Yeah, well, I've loved singing for so many years. 
[01:49:00]  And, you know, God bless.  I've been able to pursue that now and put out a CD.  Oh, that's great.  I was a big fan of Who's the Boss?  Oh, Who's the Boss?  And, of course, that other show I was on.  But I still love you.  You're so haughty.  Oh, does that mean Tony might get lucky?  Yeah.  It's great to meet you.  Oh, you can't wait to come into the show.  Right. 
[01:49:30]  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  Huh?  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  Oh, you're doing good.  You're doing great.  Yeah, I don't look like a complete buffoon up there.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  You know, because I'm pretty stupid.  No, you're not.  But you're funny.  You're funny.  It's a great show.  Hey, you watch the reruns of Taxi?  Huh?  You watch the reruns of Taxi?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  When I was a young guy, you know, my mule was all hard. 
[01:50:00]  Definitely.  And that little guy, the little guy, the little guy on Taxi.  The little guy on the Taxi.  It was, um, the little guy on Taxi.  The little guy on Taxi.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Good friend of mine, Danny DeVito.  Yeah, he used to make us laugh so much. 
[01:50:30]  He'd come in, and after a night out banging horse, he'd go, smell my finger.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, a little too risque, I understand.  And then, you know, the guy that would fix the cars?  Fix the cars.  The guy would fix the cars.  The guy.  The guy.  Latka.  Latka. 
[01:51:00]  Latka.  Latka.  Yeah, you know, I kind of forget.  I'm getting old in my old age.  Latka, yes.  Latka.  Yeah, he would come in after banging bros and say, smell my mule.  Yeah, that's great though.  I'm so excited to see you.  You know, it's like Dr. Phil says.  You know, when you give something up, you've got to replace it with something else.  Right.  You know, you understand that, right?  Oh, I completely understand it.  Yeah, huh?  So how long before they let you in? 
[01:51:30]  I don't know.  We're still waiting.  Hey, do you know who's on the show today?  No.  Uh-oh.  I was hoping you'd tell me, because they don't tell me until the last minute.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we don't know who's on the show today.  Hey, how big of a Tony Danza fan are you?  I'm a big fan.  A big, big fan?  I'm a huge fan.  We're all huge fans.  We have eight people.  Yeah.  Um, let's get your CD. 
[01:52:00]  Excuse me?  Could you give me a CD?  I will personally give you a CD after the show.  As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, if you, uh, let my, uh, my person on the scene  there, Eric, know, uh, where you're sitting, uh, how would, how would you like to come backstage  after the show and, uh, hang out with Tony?  I would love it.  I have, I have eight people with me.  Can they come too?  They could all come backstage.  That would be awesome.  But, you know, there's a little trade-off here. 
[01:52:30]  Okay.  You know, a little trade-off.  I do for you.  You do for Tony Danza.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, do you understand?  I completely understand.  We love him.  Hello?  Here we go again.  Hello?  Do you, do you know the kind of favor Tony needs?  You know, it's, it's pretty, uh, a lot of high pressure, uh, doing a show, uh, every  day like this.  You, you understand?  Oh, I completely understand. 
[01:53:00]  And, uh, I need to relax a little bit.  You know, I need to relax.  I used to have to relax on a set of taxi and who's the boss.  And, uh, there were people that would help, uh, me relax.  Maybe you could help me relax a little bit is what I'm saying.  I'll, I'll help you relax.  You know, maybe a little back rub?  Definitely.  Would you like to give me a back rub?  I sure will.  Hey, maybe a little front rub.  Oh, my God.  Are you married?  Yeah, I'm getting married in March. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, well, I'll try to put a stop to that, huh?  Hey, you keep your husband happy, huh?  Yes.  Definitely.  Hey, you want to do me a favor?  Sure.  When I'm doing my, uh, my monologue at the beginning of the show, would you come up on stage and  give me a kiss?  Oh, I sure will.  I would love it.  You know, I'm starting a new segment on the program and I like having a lovely young lady 
[01:54:00]  come out on stage and give me a little peck on the cheek.  I would be honored to.  I would definitely be honored to.  Now, uh, we, we need a good, a good time, uh, for you to come out.  Okay.  And give me that little kiss on the cheek.  Okay, definitely.  Now, as soon as I walk out.  Okay.  I'll walk out on the stage.  Okay.  And I want you to, you know, the audience is applauding because I'm Tony Danza. 
[01:54:30]  Uh-huh.  And you, uh, you come out and, uh, I'll be like, oh, here's someone from the crowd.  And just, uh, say, I love you, Tony, and give me a kiss on the cheek.  Oh, that'd be awesome.  And then you go back to your seat and I'll give you a CD and you come back and give me  a massage.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  I'm so excited.  And so am I.  Thank you.  I won't ruin it by saying anything else.  All right.  I look forward to seeing you on stage at the beginning of the show. 
[01:55:00]  I sure will.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you very much.  God bless.  Thank you very much.  God bless you, too.  Bye-bye.  Hey, guys.  Eric.  Hey, um, we have the head of security here.  He's right next to me.  He wants to confirm that, uh, we're, this isn't the Opie and Anthony show, that it's really  Z100.  Um, yeah, sure.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  All right.  Uh, we have somebody from the company who wants to, if you want to confirm it. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, you didn't have him there.  Uh-oh.  Well.  Their problem?  Sounds like somebody's onto this shenanigan.  I knew it.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Someone from the show knows the deal now.  That stinks.  Oh.  Well, I'm still going to have to watch today, and hopefully they won't talk to that woman.  Yeah, they'll talk right to her.  Do you think?  Yeah.  This is how the will get it done.  I don't know.  Maybe Eric, uh, kept her away from, uh, the girl I was talking to. 
[01:56:00]  Who knows?  I don't know.  Boy, they always think it's Tony.  They're so happy to talk to that big, dumb bastard.  Your impression's phenomenal, though.  I think it's Tony, and I'm looking at you.  Big dumbass.  Eric's all nervous.  He's down there in his fake Tony Danza t-shirt.  Is he wearing a fake Tony Danza t-shirt?  Yeah.  Yeah, he went down there with it.  We actually had t-shirts made up.  Let's say Tony Danza show staff.  Yeah.  We got, like, Tony Danza staff t-shirt, a jacket, a hat. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know, we go all out for our bits.  We do it enough.  One of these days, it's going to happen.  They're probably making an announcement before the show.  If Tony spoke with you on the phone, don't come running out on the stage, okay?  You fucking roon.  Come out and give me a kiss on my cock.  Duh.  Oh, wow. 
[01:57:00]  She was very happy to, uh, spoke with Tony.  You may have to just be vicious from now on, then.  If it's never going to get on stage, you may just have to keep smashing them with filth.  I know.  You know what's really funny?  She doesn't...  I'm talking to her, and I bring up that Dr. Phil said, you know, if you give something  up, you've got to replace it with something.  You understand?  And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, she's just so thrilled to talk with this idiot that she doesn't care what he's  saying.  She's just agreeing with it.  She's agreeing with anything. 
[01:57:30]  We're trying to get Eric back on the line, but...  Hey, where'd he go?  Oh, Ben's laughing.  Ben, you can come back in.  The boss thing's over.  Jesus.  Why is Ben cackling?  I don't know, but he's got something to say.  He's in an outbreak suit, Ben.  He's just afraid.  He's being, uh, they're threatening to arrest him.  What?  Disorderly conduct.  How is that disorderly conduct?  He's the most orderly guy ever.  Then they grabbed his phone or something.  They grabbed his phone.  Grabbed his phone.  Oh, my God.  What?  Is this going to be the first person arrested on the new Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:58:00]  Eric.  Why can't I fucking do it?  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  Yeah, they're not letting me leave.  They're threatening to arrest me here for disordering me, contact, and ruining their show.  Eric, run away.  They're not cops.  Leave right now.  Run.  Hello?  Oh, they got it again.  Just run away.  He's got to just run.  They don't understand.  People don't understand.  If they're not cops, you can flee.  Yeah.  Run away.  Oh, Eric's going to get arrested now.  Eric's going to get arrested because he's not running away. 
[01:58:30]  Like stupid Mercurio.  Run away.  Run.  Run.  Run.  They're not cops.  You can run from Danza security.  They're not going to put an APB.  Hey, call in all cars.  Call in all cars.  Look for a cute little juggy boy with frosted hair.  Car 54, where are you?  Oh, it's the Danza police.  The Danza police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:59:00]  I thought we were pretty sneaky today.  They've been just waiting for us, huh?  Pull over.  Who's the boss?  I'm the boss.  Don't make a move.  Drop the cell phone.  Well, someone has to get down there.  Oh, he's got to run.  I'll give Ben all the numbers for the record label guy.  So I'll go down there.  Well, uh.  Disturb.  What is it?  Disorderly conduct?  That was the most orderly call ever.  Danny's good.  Danny, go run down there with a cell phone.  Don't get caught and tell us what the hell's going on.  Because they took us. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, wait.  Is he back?  Who's this?  Hey, it's Eric.  All right, what's going on?  The guy keeps smacking the phone out of my hand and closing it.  He's like, I don't give a fuck who you're talking to.  He's like, if you get it.  And he's sitting here trying to take a picture and everything.  Just walk away, stupid.  I've been trying to, but the guy won't let me fucking get me, girl.  What, is he holding on to you?  Yeah.  He's not allowed to hold you.  That's assault.  Punch him in the face.  Punch him in the frigging nuts.  I said, no, I just took a cab here. 
[02:00:00]  And he said, well, how would you want to bet if I go through you, you got a while?  I said, you can't go through me.  I don't know who the fuck you are.  You're not a cop.  He's not a cop.  Run away.  I'm trying to.  Break loose and run.  Break loose.  Break loose.  He was one of those.  Unbelievable.  He was a master pose.  Data security can't tell him not to be on the floor.  Of course they can.  And you can talk to anybody on line.  Is our guy going to get arrested with a face, Tony Bannon?  You can talk to anybody on line with a phone. 
[02:00:30]  You don't want to be at the tombs with a Tony Danza show t-shirt on.  All right.  Well, hey, my thoughts and prayers are with Eric.  Danny can handle this because we need you for the next segment.  Can Danny handle this, though, or should Steve go?  No, Danny can handle this.  He's good.  Just tell Danny to run there with the phone.  All right.  All right.  I got Steve's strategy.  Steve will go there.  They'll be upset.  Pull the fire alarms because they'll see a blade.  And he'll be able to make good at his escape.  Yeah.  You weren't in Chicago overnight, were you?  No.  No.  Sorry.  Saw some of your clothes flying out a window. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Doing a little office work at night.  Were you?  How can this head of security smack his phone?  Who the fuck is this guy?  He's a Tony Danza security.  He's a bully.  That's all he is.  He's intimidating.  He's probably huge.  I bet he's a huge black guy that just thinks he can intimidate the shit out of Eric.  And Eric's scared.  Wow.  Send me after Poe.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  We really should.  We should send Poe down there.  Send Poe down there.  Oh.  Spin kick the sun.  Go in and just kick ass on the Danza set.  No, but you know what?  If Eric is going to be hassled physically, you can't have that.  It can't happen to him. 
[02:01:30]  No.  The guy could be arrested for assault right there.  You're just holding him.  Yeah, you can't grab him.  You can't be knocking the cell phone out of his...  Absolutely not.  You don't bother to go online and interview or talk to anybody you want.  There's no security guy on a sidewalk.  Well, can better somebody get Billy Mac or one of those guys on the phone?  Billy Mac.  Get Billy Mac.  Master Poe.  What's wrong?  Eric's in trouble?  Yeah, one of our guys is in trouble.  Yeah, he has no bullshit.  He's online.  He's probably getting into things.  He's getting arrested.  The head of security won't...  He's just on the phone. 
[02:02:00]  He wasn't doing anything.  And the head of security is like...  Every time he tries to call the show, the head of security won't let him go.  And he keeps smacking his phone.  What exactly did he do?  On the phone.  Just with the phone.  Interviewing somebody on the line.  Okay.  This just in.  He got away?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, good.  Of course.  Is he running?  Yeah, he's running.  I just told him I'm running in the middle of traffic.  Just running.  You could lose him.  What did they do to him?  Oh, I don't know.  Nothing.  They knocked a cell phone out of his hand.  Right.  We'll get the phone report.  Or when Eric gets back here.  We're getting in contact with Keith.  You can't do that. 
[02:02:30]  Bodily holding him.  No, you can't do that.  That's against the law.  You can't smack anything out of anyone.  When Sex Bagel gets back, we'll find out exactly what happened.  I really think that if he smacked the phone out of his hand, Eric should file a report.  Exactly.  He should.  There's nothing illegal about interviewing somebody on a line.  Of course not.  Why do we have to deal with cops again?  Twice already?  It's not against the law.  No.  Eric's not a disorderly guy.  It's not against the law.  Maybe he can get free tickets for Tony.  And he's a nice guy.  He did nothing.  Oh, my God.  Master Poe's going to lose his mind. 
[02:03:00]  Look at him.  Breathe.  He's taking the legal road.  Breathe.  Thoughts and praise, Poe.  Breathe.  We've got to get some boards in here that you can break when you just get pissed off.  We should contact Keith because, honestly...  Well, we'll find out as soon as Eric gets here.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  I hope he's ditching the Tony Danza t-shirt where Master Poe ditched the bloody gee.  The bloody gee in a dumpster.  That'd work.  Ditch the evidence.  Eric, if you're listening to us, ditch the evidence.  How is he listening to you?  He doesn't have...  Maybe he hasn't lost his ear.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, we'll find out what happens when he gets here, okay? 
[02:03:30]  Okay.  All right, Poe.  Breathe.  Breathe for us, okay?  Poe's very pissed off.  Eric running down the street.  Your mom's fine!  All right.  He got the word in.  Great.  Man, they've been waiting for us.  We've been wondering.  We were being set up.  We were being lulled into a false sense of security.  You heard how sneaky we were.  We didn't tell anyone.  We just went to it real fast.  Because they're with the dopey shirt on.  You know that pissed them off.  Too bad.  It's not illegal.  You can wear whatever the hell you want.  This is the Tony Danza shirt.  But why they ask if you were the other radio station? 
[02:04:00]  I guess it's okay if Z100 does it, but not us.  Because Z100 isn't going to say things like Tony needs his cock sucked.  I think it might have been what I was gathering there.  They think Eric was saying he was with the Opie and Anthony show, but he was really with  Z100, so they wanted to know who was really at the bottom of this so they could get them  in trouble.  So they were trying to get Z100 in trouble, thinking it was Z100.  That's what I think.  There you go.  I don't think they have a relationship with the Z100. 
[02:04:30]  I think they thought Eric was lying and saying it was Opie and Anthony.  I think Eric panicked and said, I'm with Z100.  Oh, you think Eric did that?  Of course he did.  Or a misrepresentation of himself?  Would you say you were with Opie and Anthony on the line?  He probably just went, who are you here with?  You know, some douchebag security guy.  Yeah, he does do that to get out of trouble sometimes.  Oh, yeah, and he figures out what's the faggiest radio station, so maybe they'll have some  sympathy for me.  Hey, man, this is Tommy Chong, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:05:00]  Boy, how bad can it get?  All right, so Anthony, wow.  Eric is on his way back to the station.  Yeah.  He had a call up twice for us to tell him to run, though, which gets me...  And then I have a briefing with some of these people, Opie, because the prime rule for anyone  out and about that is involved with this show on the street ever, ever, ever...  Is to make sure you get arrested so we get the publicity?  Well, yeah, that's the real thing.  But we can't really say that.  The official line we tell them is to run. 
[02:05:30]  Or just walk away fast.  They can't grab you for something like that.  No.  But apparently the security guard at the Tony Danza show grabbed Eric.  They were on to us.  And was holding him, saying that the cops had been called, and that he was holding him  there, bodily.  And they would grab his cell phone or smack his cell phone out of his hand.  And this constitutes assault, Opie.  Now, here's the problem.  If the cops were called, then the cops will be here.  Because now they have to get to the bottom of it.  Good.  Let them.  Eric can call whoever he wants. 
[02:06:00]  Do you think New York's finest is going to take the time out to come down here after  they talk to a Danza security guard and find out that nothing was happening?  Danny.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Danny.  I just got to the line.  There's no sign of Eric.  But there is a big beefy security guard I could probably talk to.  All right.  Yeah.  Ask him where Eric went.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait.  We can't get our internet.  Wait.  Wait.  Danny.  Yeah.  Should we do that?  He just wants to ask him.  But maybe we should hear from Eric first. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you just ask the security guard what happened to the Eric guy?  The guy from G100.  The guy from...  Hey.  Was there a guy here named Eric?  No.  Because I'm looking for him.  I don't see him.  I was just wondering if you might know where he's.  He was interviewing the Tony Danza audience member.  He has no idea where Eric might be.  All right.  I wonder if that's the same guy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It could be a different guy.  Okay.  I'm peeking into the windows looking for him inside. 
[02:07:00]  No.  Danny.  Eric ran away.  He did run away?  Yeah.  He ran away.  He made like a banana and split.  Yes.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Thank you.  He ran like Bobby De Niro from a Norton photo op.  Oh, God.  That one hurts.  Thank you.  Hey, she from New York.  Did he say that?  Yes.  I'm not going to say that.  Call her, Eric.  I want to see where he is.  We want to.  Ben Ope wants Eric on the phone.  Get all the details.  So, we've been doing this Tony Danza thing off and on for.  Well, I guess that's only the third time, right? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  That's only the third.  Is my mic lower again?  I don't know.  Eric ran, man.  Somebody held Steve C's hat under his ass.  There we go.  Yeah.  From time to time, we go out to the Tony Danza line as they're filing in to see that stupid  show.  And Anthony does a great Tony Danza impression.  And we have a little fun with it.  And we have fun with the rubes that are waiting to see Tony Danza.  Because they're all rubes on that line.  And they buy it every single time.  Every single time.  We're all happy to talk to Tony.  We haven't been tripped up once.  Do we have, like, the other one all queued up? 
[02:08:00]  Maybe we can play this.  And by the time this ends, Eric will be in studio.  How does that sound?  This was the dirty one.  This is the dirty version?  Yeah.  This is pretty funny, though.  So, you know, finally today they were on to us.  And they caught us.  And I don't know what's going to happen.  Because they were trying to hold Eric there, the security guard.  And supposedly the cops were called.  I bet they had a big meeting about this a while back.  And they were all psyched that it was happening today.  Probably on the walkie-talkies.  Yeah, it's going down.  It's going down on the line.  He's out there.  He's out there.  Code blue.  Code blue. 
[02:08:30]  He's on the line.  Big meeting.  All right, if it happens again, I want some fucking heads busted.  Yeah, you know how he...  Like Dan's in there with a baseball bat.  I guarantee that's how he talks when he's not on his show.  These fucking pricks fuck with my show again.  I want some blood on that fucking sidewalk.  You hear me?  I ain't the nice fucking Danza here today, pal.  It's just all nasty.  Like when they take the guy back at the casino and he's been cheating. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, in The Cooler?  What was that?  No, no.  I think...  What movie was that?  Casino.  Casino.  And they take the guys that were cheating.  Oh, my God.  In the back.  You could have the money or your hand.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was also in The Cooler.  Yeah, they had a scene like that.  It was.  Yeah, but your casino's bigger.  Deeply disturbing.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, why don't you come back here, huh?  You don't fuck with Danza.  I'll give you the fucking Danza.  No thoughts and prayers to this scum bag.  Thoughts and prayers to your face.  So, Eric, what happened? 
[02:09:30]  We were convinced we were going to get away with it again.  Yeah.  Well, you did to an extent, but as soon as she handed the phone back to me, I turn around  and there's this guy right there.  And he starts going, who are you?  Who are you working for?  I didn't give him a name or who I was working for, right?  So, as I said on the phone, I'm like, this guy wants proof that I'm with, and I said another  company.  Of course.  All right?  And he said...  And then he takes the phone out of my hand and he closes the phone like this.  Just slaps it down.  It gets in my face.  Then he pulls me by my left shoulder here. 
[02:10:00]  So, he did put his hands on you and...  He pulled my shoulder, pulled me just...  I mean, it wasn't like vicious.  That's all you need.  But it was about a foot away from where the line is, where everybody is.  It's assault.  And he gets right in my face and he goes, I can have you arrested for disorderly contact,  disrupting the show.  And he's going through all this other stuff.  I said, I'm on a public sidewalk with a cell phone talking to another person.  So, he's just getting right in my face and these two other guys come out from the  building, look like cops but not really cops kind of thing.  Dan's a security. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  So, they come out there and they're standing there and they've got a list.  They've had some paper in their hand and they're going over the thing and I gave them  a fake name and they're just shaking their heads because that name's not on the list.  I guess they researched the show.  They have a list of everyone involved with this program.  He was trying to get me to say I was with Opie and Anthony.  Right.  He was trying.  And I was saying, I'm not with them.  I said, they're another company.  What was in the book?  I couldn't see them.  They wouldn't show it to me.  But they had it.  They're going down this list here.  I saw a white piece of paper.  It's probably a list with all our faces and our names and all that. 
[02:11:00]  Great.  Saying, we've had nothing but problems from this show.  We don't want these people out there.  We've been instructed to get rid of these people or do whatever's necessary to get rid of these people.  Whatever's necessary.  Well, that's Tony Danza.  Assaulting our staff on a public sidewalk.  What happened with the phone?  You kept calling in.  The phone kept calling.  The guy kept shutting the phone.  How could he do that without touching you?  All right.  At this point, when he pulls me aside and he's telling me, no, you cannot do that, right?  The first time, he closes the phone.  And he's yelling at me, Ben calls. 
[02:11:30]  So I open the phone again.  I'm talking to Ben for maybe.  And he pulled it onto you at this point?  No, he let me go.  He just pulled me one quick second away from the line and then let me go.  He wasn't still holding me.  Was he pulling you on your Tony Danza t-shirt?  No, I hit that real quick.  Oh, you hit.  I had the jacket right up there buttoned.  I was like, he's not seeing that shirt.  You pussy.  Hey, we're all on the same team.  We all work for Tony.  So I'm standing on the sidewalk there, right?  Ben calls. 
[02:12:00]  I talk to Ben maybe three to five seconds.  All of a sudden, out of my hand again.  Click.  He's got my phone now.  He took my phone.  He took the phone out of your hand.  Opened my phone and starts hitting buttons trying to see what's in the phone.  Like he's trying to find out where my phone book is on the phone, trying to find who I just dialed and all that.  Hey, Columbo, knock it off.  How much?  This guy wants so bad to be some type of cop.  A cop.  Yep.  He's a lot of him.  Now this is his big chance with his book with our names in it and grabbing the phone and trying to get numbers out of your phone. 
[02:12:30]  That's invasion of privacy.  So as soon as he's doing that, I take the phone back and I close it, right?  I said, what are you doing?  And he said, let me see some ID.  I said, I don't have ID.  I took a cab here.  And I don't have to show you.  He goes, how much you want to bet if I go through your pockets right now, I find a wallet.  And he's pointing to my left side here, which is my keys and my other phone.  Big lump.  And I said, those are keys.  And I said, and you're not searching me.  Now this time I realized I'm standing at the edge of the curb, so I walk into the street. 
[02:13:00]  Now I'm in the street.  He comes right to the edge, but he won't walk into the street.  And he's still yelling at me, the two other guys.  It doesn't matter.  The sidewalk or the street, it's not Ben's job.  I know, but Ben just goes, run into traffic.  So I'm trying to get into traffic.  You're going to be a fine parent, Ben.  Yes.  So I'm trying to get into traffic.  There's cars coming, so I'm stuck between that little gap of the street and the actual traffic.  And those other guys are blocking me, so I can't move anywhere.  And then I'm trying to get on the phone again, and the phone just, the last time it crapped out. 
[02:13:30]  There you go.  There you go.  Running across the street.  Just run into traffic.  What's all that racket outside?  I'm trying to do a show.  I've got to be honest.  I don't think there's anything illegal about you being out there talking to people.  There isn't.  No.  And I think that a public sidewalk, we might have to call and say, look, this guy grabbed  you.  He's shutting your phone.  That can't happen. 
[02:14:00]  He grabbed you.  I don't care if he just pulled me a foot.  That's assault.  He kept taking your phone and shutting it.  You can't touch somebody else's shit.  And he started going through the phone.  Property is also another charge.  So what was going on with the lady that you talked to?  She was cool.  There was like a party of eight from Philadelphia.  It was like grandmothers, granddaughters, and regular daughters.  There was a whole big family affair because one of them was getting married next week.  So they came up to go to the Tony Danza show.  And they were all excited.  They were having a blast talking on the phone. 
[02:14:30]  They were all sitting there.  Danny DeVito.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were all cheering.  And they were trying to come up with the names of the people that Tony couldn't remember.  And one of the older ladies is tapping on him.  He's like, he's got a CD.  Get a CD.  And she goes, oh, yeah.  Can we get a CD?  And of course Tony said yes.  Of course.  A good egg.  What a good guy.  Oh, one of the other things he told me, too, when he goes, I guess you said give Tony a kiss on the cheek.  That's how you get in favor with Tony.  And he starts listing these other things, which were never said.  But I didn't hear the phone call, so I don't know. 
[02:15:00]  So I was like, I said, dude, I was standing right next to you.  I did not hear that phone call.  Were they listening?  They might have an XM there.  They have an XM in there.  I guess they like the Open Anthony show.  And the security probably.  It's probably their job, when that line is out there, to listen to this program.  Well, I did a contest with those guys, too, for a free XM.  Go home.  Just go home.  Jesus.  Just go home.  Can you give me a coffee while you're out there looking for a rope?  Yeah.  Please go home.  Just go.  Walk away.  Play the Hulk music.  Do something.  Get him out of here. 
[02:15:30]  They can't ask you for ID or anything.  You're not running into the building causing it.  You're on a phone.  Yeah.  I didn't give him a thing.  Didn't tell him my name.  Didn't tell him who I worked for.  You took your pinch like a man.  You didn't write.  That's right.  Ah, De Niro again.  We can't tell him anymore.  Well, Master Poe is pacing like a mother hen.  He's freaking out.  He was human.  He's positioning me outside.  Now, how did he come at you?  What angle?  How did he come at you?  That's the real deal.  Master Poe, share the mic with Eric.  Yeah, okay, that was assault, and we should call the cops right now. 
[02:16:00]  That is assault.  Right now.  You were assaulted on a public sidewalk by some stupid security guard.  Well, Master Poe, that's your call, obviously.  You know, Master Poe is very pissed off because he looks so close.  He protects us.  He's like a mother hen.  One of these ducklings.  If that guy grabs you like that, you would have taken that as an assault.  You would have taken and reacted as an assault.  Well, by law, you're not supposed to grab someone, and if someone is attacking you or  if someone is actually trying to grab you, immediately you can defend yourself, so it's 
[02:16:30]  self-defense.  And in his case, I don't know what the guy looks like or what skills he has.  It doesn't matter.  He's supposed to be a professional.  You can't put your hands on anybody.  It doesn't even matter how it is.  If you put your hand on someone's back, like you want to ask him a question, and you put  your hand on his back, once the hand touches somebody, you can be charged with assault  if that person wants to charge.  Like an umpire, like Earl Weaver, you should turn his hat around, because if you're a hat  touching the umpire, you are thrown out of the game.  Right.  Any type of contact.  Right.  Plus, I believe it's also a robbery, because he grabbed the phone out of his hands. 
[02:17:00]  There's something else there.  Absolutely.  I'm not a police officer.  Let's get all the police officers out there to call.  No 911.  I don't want to tie up emergency lines with that, but we should call a precinct and do something  about that.  You haven't talked to.  I think they need a talking to.  We've got an expert on the line.  Perhaps a bit more.  Keith the cop.  What's up?  Good morning.  I just got a call from Clubby.  He needs to be corrected.  Everything okay?  Hey, Ben.  Our boy Sex Bagel was roughed up a little bit outside the Tony Danza show. 
[02:17:30]  He was assaulted by a Tony Danza security guard.  What do we have here?  What are the facts?  The facts are Eric was on the sidewalk while the line was going into the Tony Danza show.  He gave a woman that was online the telephone, and she got to speak with Tony Danza.  And Eric might have been impersonating a worker from the Tony Danza show.  Right.  An employee.  Yeah.  So after the phone call is done, Eric takes the phone back. 
[02:18:00]  Eric, a security guard for the Danza show, I believe, comes up to Eric and grabbed him by his shoulder and pulled him over to him.  And started telling him how he wasn't allowed to do that, how it was disorderly conduct, disruption of the show, all kinds of stuff that could get him, he thought could get him in trouble.  But the fact of the matter is, the only person that did anything wrong was the security guard by touching Eric.  And he kept taking his phone.  Eric's trying to call the show.  The guy keeps snatching his phone. 
[02:18:30]  And the guy snatched the phone out of Eric's hand and started going through his phone book trying to find numbers in there.  And after that, Eric just finally got away from the guy and ran back to the studio.  Okay.  All right.  So now we want to, you know, maybe somebody could go over there and speak with the security guard because I think Eric feels that charges should be filed for assault.  Well, I wouldn't say it's an assault.  I'm going to have to say it's more of a harassment.  Yes.  But this is the angle I'm going to work on this whole thing. 
[02:19:00]  And it might work for us.  If we can get Tony Danza to staple his ball bag to his leg, I think we can get Tony Danza about a million and a half in bail.  You ass.  Why isn't that assault?  Because in the statutes of the law of harassment, it's push, shove, kick, punch.  It really doesn't go further than that.  We're kind of sounding faggy is what you're saying, huh?  Well, no, but harassment is still good, though. 
[02:19:30]  It's still something.  That's a good one.  It is something.  He can't just do that.  He can't just snatch his phone and go through it on a public sidewalk.  We want to teach these talk show line security people that they can't get away with this kind of stuff.  Brown shirts.  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, he was talking to Tony.  The lady was talking to Tony.  I don't know what this guy's problem is.  I know.  She was very happy.  We're making people on the line happy.  Yeah.  That's kind of, you know, out of line.  But, yeah, harassment.  Maybe I could work something with snatching the phone out of his hand. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  I don't know how happy they would be over at the precinct.  But, you know, listen, this is a violation of his rights and it's not.  We just want to know if we could violate someone with a billy club.  That's all we need to know, Keith.  Can we drag someone down to the precinct and give them the business in the men's bathroom?  We might be able to work something along those lines.  If you can't find anyone, I'll play the part of the prisoner.  Did Ovi say mother hen and baby ducklings?  You guys let me slide on that one.  Not the audience.  I know.  Killer Kittens like mother hen and baby duckling.  Ovi, why not just say elephant with a baby cub, jackass? 
[02:20:30]  That was another time where I started sweating going, oh, please.  They didn't hear that, did they?  The audience catches everything.  Oh, you ratting me out, Killer Kittens.  Thanks.  Now, what do we do?  We want this guy brought up.  I think after the show.  We're going to just go for street justice.  Well, if we don't go for the street justice, how about after the show I'll talk to Eric  and we'll see what we can come up with.  Let's do that.  I'll make a couple phone calls.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:21:00]  A lot of people are calling us a bunch of faggots on the Instant Feedback.  Why?  They're like, shut up, Sol.  They want to know if Sex Bagel was very injured.  Eric was very injured.  He grabbed me and I was hurt.  Were you physically hurt?  Well, my feelings were very hurt and I felt ashamed.  I was standing on the sidewalk and he pushed me and took my phone.  He went through my phone book and realized I have no friends and pointed that out to me. 
[02:21:30]  I was very embarrassed.  He was hurtful.  I just think that if I did get the call and I showed up and Eric told me that he was working the line to see if any ladies wanted to lick Tony's mule and then the security guy pushed me, it's a little hard to write up in the report.  You know, but I'm going to try and work an angle.  All right.  It's a radio show doing an on-the-street interview. 
[02:22:00]  That's right.  That's pretty much what it was.  Can't touch him.  No.  I have one question.  Yes, Master Poe.  Hey, Keith.  Isn't there a progression when it comes to...  This is for the listeners out there because they're saying that, you know, Eric is a wimp, the way he responded or the way that we're responding.  I think Poe's saying that, Eric.  No, no, no.  No, no, I'm not.  Actually, there's a progression.  If someone is coming at you verbally, that's step number one.  Then they're going to come at you physically.  In this case, he grabbed him.  All right.  So after that, he's going to throw a punch and hit him in the face.  Yes.  Come on.  You have to draw the line somewhere. 
[02:22:30]  What country are we living in?  Russia.  I mean, where are we?  Where are we?  Canada.  Freedom.  No, I personally think that it was wrong for him to do that, and that wasn't professional.  It's just that, you know, how wrong was it?  I mean, you know, in the eyes of the law.  Gotcha.  I don't think it's a felony, but I do think that maybe the security guard needs a talking to because this way, there's nothing wrong with one of our guys talking to somebody on the phone there. 
[02:23:00]  That's not illegal and it's allowed.  Too bad they're lining up for your show.  Stop using a public sidewalk then, assholes.  Make them line up in the studio.  Oh, we'll be back.  Oh, we'll be back.  Eric is a very willful young boy.  Rather naughty.  Rather naughty.  We're going to be back.  All right, Keith.  Thanks.  All right.  I'll catch up.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside radio show into this situation.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Bye, Keith.  Yeah.  There goes the party pooper.  You mentioned Oral.  You said it's a back rub.  Of course I did. 
[02:23:30]  Did you?  Not that that makes any difference, but.  And I do believe that ends the Tony Danza saga for today.  There you go.  Yeah.  Danza's a bully.  Danza's brown shirts.  Yeah.  Nazis.  The three strikes law gets tested next week.  Elo's listening right now.  I don't care.  O&A go live before the Boston home opener.  It's baseball.  It's life.  It's.  I got nothing. 
[02:24:00]  O&A.  Now, for those who find humor in sadism, then, to some strange odd group of people, I guess  it's funny.  Quite frankly, I would love to be teabagged by Donkey Sausage on the O.B. and Anthony show.  Well, she's a girl.  She can't teabag me.  But you never know with these guys.  Oh, yes.  The virus is now free. 
[02:24:30]  O.B. and Anthony are finally free on XM202.  Oh, high voltage.  Oh, my God.  They just won't leave that stuff alone.  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another O.B. and Anthony interlocular.  Hold on a sec.  Hold on.  This could be.  This is horrible.  Hello, Ms. Sausage or Donkey or?  Actually, my real name is Corinne.  So, where did Donkey Sausage come from?  Well, the origin of Donkey Sausage was the day I happened to call. 
[02:25:00]  They were late on the female callers.  And I was calling because I wanted to play What's in Your Pants.  So, if you don't know what that is, you'll have to go to ONA.com to find that out or foundrymusic.com.  But anyway, this gentleman before that called before myself asked for a strange request.  He said, why don't you get some dumb whore or some dumb whore bitch to run around the room, wait, no, wait, to shit on a plate, microwave it, throw it all over her chest, and run around the room screaming Donkey Sausage.  So, after he had called, I was like the next caller. 
[02:25:30]  And actually, I went under an alias.  My name was Raquel when I called in because I was at work and I didn't want to get in trouble for it.  And actually, I quit because of the whole thing anyway.  But needless to say, Opie asked me if I would kindly run around my store screaming Donkey Sausage.  I said, sure, I can do that.  And Anthony was like, oh, make sure you say it all silly, real silly.  So, I was like, Donkey Sausage, Donkey Sausage.  And I'm running around the radio shack screaming Donkey Sausage. 
[02:26:00]  And Jimmy was like, oh, that's kind of hot.  They were like, there's something oddly arousing by that.  Well, that doesn't have to do with swallowing Big Giant.  Oh, well, I mean, I do that, but I do that privately.  I mean, there's appointments involved.  There's all kinds of stuff that goes behind the scenes on that.  I mean, I've got many different aliases and we don't have to talk about those, you know.  There are plenty of members of the XM Nation who have no idea who O and A are, much less have heard them.  You are selling O and A.  Oh, absolutely.  What do you say?  What the hell are you waiting for? 
[02:26:30]  Turn on Opie and Anthony every day, 7 to 11.  And if you don't, I'm going to come to your job screaming Donkey Sausage until you get fired.  How about that?  How about them apples?  That's right.  Yeah, and ladies, do the wowing.  Do the wowing.  It's good times.  Tell me about wowing.  Wowing?  Wowing is whip them out Wednesday or whip them out whenever.  If you see somebody with a wow sticker on their car, ladies are supposed to do their duties and show them the breasts or the boozies, I call them. 
[02:27:00]  We do our part.  What does your significant other think about your membership in the O and A virus?  Well, right now I don't have a significant other because of certain activities I partake in.  So, you know, certain things that aren't allowed in relationships and I, you know, go over every boundary that could possibly be put on the ground.  And I've actually had to get written, you know, have to get rid of some bodies when I get back home today.  Do you have a website? 
[02:27:30]  It's in works.  It's in the works right now.  But you can go to eatabullet.com and check out that website.  If you want to know more about donkey sausage, go to eatabullet.com.  That's a little too cute.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, God.  This star of the Diva series, I believe, Anthony.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony worst of thing here.  And I just slurred Opie, my own name.  But fuck it.  Just keep rolling tape.  I don't care.  We're on vacation.  You'll never hear this. 
[02:28:00]  Coffee Diva, Anthony.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  That's it?  Well, what happened was, I believe it was either intern number one or intern number three went to get me, well, fetch coffee for me.  And they know that I like a certain type of a beverage.  And they believe he brought me back the incorrect brand.  And the wrath of Jimmy ensued.  Yeah, you had to punish the intern. 
[02:28:30]  In a way, I've never seen an intern punished.  In a sexy way.  Oh, was this the intro of that bit?  Oh, yeah.  Well, the only day we did that bit, that's when we have to bring back, by the way.  Ah, no, that's okay.  It was a fine punishment.  I know.  This gets a little saucy.  That actually is what happened to Pat O'Brien.  He was just doing this bit into the telephone.  And locking his hands.  Coffee Diva.  Say, Jim, what's real?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  What is this?  If someone farts or... 
[02:29:00]  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into this bit with a reading?  What is this?  What's the problem, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Kill him!  I don't know.  But...  Oh, boy.  Derek, why is your face turning red?  Warm up your vocal cords.  You might be reading.  You might have to warm up that...  Where do we get our coffee every day? 
[02:29:30]  All right, what's going on?  No one knows what's going on.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  Exactly.  But if it said Starbucks, you'd know that immediately.  Oh, yeah.  Ben, don't explain what's happening on the air because people hate your voice.  Stop ruining things, Ben.  You're ruining the show, Ben.  I don't like...  This is why...  Two reasons I don't like this coffee.  It doesn't taste good, and I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  Yeah, I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  Yup. 
[02:30:00]  You betcha.  But at least they're not funding terrorism.  I will not support the savages.  How much money from one cup of coffee, from like a dollar cup of coffee, do you think goes to Al-Qaeda?  I'm not saying necessarily Al-Qaeda, but...  I would say probably 15 cents out of every buck.  You might be right.  Yeah.  And even if it doesn't go to Al-Qaeda, it just goes to a guy who will watch a video of the detergents.  They go, well, I see their point.  And I just don't want him to have my 15 cents.  You don't want to support that, my friend.  Absolutely not.  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  I won't support it.  I will not.  Did you get that cup of coffee from a raghead? 
[02:30:30]  No, I got it downstairs.  Exactly.  The ones that won't let me in.  Sometimes I come in at 5 to 6 or whatever.  Oh, we're closed.  I'm like, can I buy coffee?  No.  That's a normal, like, joint, though.  That's not one of those corner delis.  It's not whatever it is.  I don't like it.  I like Starbucks.  I like the big company that mushes the mom and pop awful companies.  Only because their coffee is always stale.  So did you tell him to go to Starbucks and he didn't?  You want to taste this?  You want to taste this and see how enjoyable this is?  Why don't you throw it against the wall, you diva?  I'm not a diva. 
[02:31:00]  I'm not a diva.  Why don't you want Starbucks coffee?  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  Why are you picking up your Rent Boys book?  I don't know.  We all, look, I like him.  He's a good kid.  He's got a great smile.  But we all, we all know the rules.  Oh, God.  The show's going to turn gay again.  It's not going to turn gay.  I just pray there's a couple out there that wants to be, try to become the sexiest state  in America.  When you ask, when you ask the intern for coffee and they know where you like your coffee from 
[02:31:30]  and they come back.  Yeah, why did you go downstairs?  First of all, he didn't say anything about Starbucks and I haven't been on a coffee run  in like three weeks.  Oh, really?  Three or four weeks.  Really?  Well, I haven't saluted the flag in a little while, but I still know to do it when it's  in front of me.  Oh, God.  Was that valid?  No.  Either way, as your punishment, because you're a fine young man and you work very hard, but  this was inexcusable, there will have to be another coffee run for Starbucks and you're  going to have to read, young man.  It's a very short paragraph from there to there and I want you to read with dignity and  I want you to read proudly. 
[02:32:00]  No laughing.  Hold on.  Anthony, I want to explain because there's a lot of new listeners.  This is the only bit that Jim Norton has officially.  He's officially brought to the O&A show.  Ever.  He contributes very nicely on a daily basis, but as far as bringing bits to the table,  he usually doesn't, but he decided to bring this one to the table.  Brought in a lovely book entitled Rent Boys.  Don't fold it back.  You're bending the cover.  I like that picture.  Rent Boys on the cover is a nude man, young man covering his sensitives with his hand 
[02:32:30]  and another hand tweaking his nipple on the cover.  And it's filled with stories of gay sex.  And Jim hands out these punishments to people around here when they do something wrong.  And the punishment is to read from the book.  You have to read seriously.  You can't laugh it off like, you know, make a joke about it because then it just comes  off like a joke.  And what happens if he laughs during it?  Do you want him to pull his pants down and you can paddle him? 
[02:33:00]  No.  But if he laughs, believe me, I'll have him reading so much that his lips will be too  tired to laugh.  If he thinks Kaufman did some reading of The Great Gatsby, he will certainly be doing  some...  Love Andy Kaufman references.  Hey, hey.  She gets a mood in here.  It's like a Mark Perino show with an intern saying things like this.  Great, huh?  You need a PlayStation young fella.  Dave from Jersey, he says, look, I never went for coffee there, but I know Norton loves  Starbucks.  Yeah.  That's right.  Dave from Jersey.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  And I like the fact that Starbucks is always fresh.  I'm not whoring for Starbucks.  I just like the...  It tastes the same every time.  I would rather be like a hippocool guy and a hippocool.  That's what you like.  I'd rather support a smaller...  Hey, I don't go with the big ones, man.  But the coffee always stinks in these places.  I'm sorry.  Stinks.  It's different every different place you go.  Every place.  So you're safe at Starbucks.  I like the flavor.  There you go.  Don't read ahead, young man.  Just be surprised as it happens.  All right.  Let her rip.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  All right.  He withdraws slowly, gently.  He stands up.  I reach over and peel the rubber away, letting it drop to the floor. 
[02:34:00]  I hug him to me and place a now semi-flaccid cock in my mouth.  It no longer smells scrub.  I lick it.  I roll over on my back and hang my head over the edge of the bed.  I begin stroking my cock, intent now on my own orgasm.  He bends his hard prick so that it slides easily into my mouth and down my throat.  As he begins to fuck my face, I close my eyes and breathe in the marvelous musky scent of his sweaty, heavy ball sack. 
[02:34:30]  Turn it off.  I begin to cum.  He cannot stop me now.  My pleasure is so intense, I begin to choke on his flesh deep inside my throat.  Smells like...  Oh, he tastes delicious.  Victory.  I will be generous with this boy.  Very generous.  Good job.  Thanks, fella.  Get some coffee medium with skim milk. 
[02:35:00]  It's going to smell like his musty, heavy sack.  Look, that was harder for us than it was for you.  That was difficult.  I don't like to meet out the punishments.  That was a bad one.  You could tell that was really, really bad.  Dude, I don't like...  Do you think I like handing these out?  I think you do.  It helps people.  Young Eric had a misstep the other day and did some reading, and might I say, he has  been in tip-top shape ever since.  What is this? 
[02:35:30]  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  What is this? 
[02:36:00]  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not that.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  You're checking out the worst of Opiate Anthony.  We're both on vacation, but we're here kind of introing some of the worst of bits.  And who doesn't like a good Doody story? 
[02:36:30]  Doody.  This is Lil Jimmy having a little problem in kindergarten, I believe.  Was it kindergarten?  It was kindergarten.  Kindergarten.  He had a little problem with Doody.  Yeah.  Who knew?  You were a stinky little kid, weren't you?  Yeah.  I was a little pants pooper and a real creep.  But I've seen pictures.  You were a very cute little kid.  I was the absolute, the yin and the yang.  I was so molestable, and yet my ass was caked with fecal matter. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  So there you have a cute little kid that just stinks like shit.  Oh, what a horror show.  That was your protection.  Yeah.  Like a skunk.  He's like a skunk.  Like if an old man came up and tried to tussle his hair, he'd raise up his butt and just stink him out.  Yeah.  I'm sure a few snuck in there and tussled my cowlick head and put little Jimmy's face in a pillow,  and then all of a sudden I learned a natural defense.  You can walk it at you with a lollipop, get too close, and run away. 
[02:37:30]  That's hilarious.  Doody.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Are we all going to go to the bathroom?  Because I've got to go.  Let's all go to the bathroom.  The show started and no one was here.  I'll go to the bathroom.  I'm going to.  All right.  Come on.  Let's all go.  Three men walking, talking.  Where's Ben?  We need an open window in there.  It's only eight degrees out.  Oh, he really...  I'm telling you, somebody scarred him as a child.  You know what it is?  Ben, in his little kindergarten class, went in there and his little fat midget legs were hanging off the ball, 
[02:38:00]  not hitting the floor, and he dropped an atomic log.  And it probably reeked and stunk up the whole classroom.  That's why he opens that thing, because little Ben's duties smelled up the classroom.  Right.  Open the door.  And you know those bathrooms when you're in kindergarten?  They're right in the room.  Yep.  You don't go down the hallway.  Yep.  It's in the room.  So you get done.  You hear the...  The door opens up, and now the smell wafts into the kindergarten class. 
[02:38:30]  And the little children all giggled, chuckled, and pointed at Big Doody Ben.  Well, I'll bet you the girl he had a crush on back then had to go right after,  and her and her little leather shoes went in right after old tsunami colon wrecked the little kindergarten bathroom.  And she came out and started pointing at Stinky Doody Ben and his messy kindergarten hair.  Gravy dripping down his leg onto his hush puppies.  Did you guys have the girl?  Did you guys have the girl in grammar school that peed her pants, 
[02:39:00]  and the teacher had to have the spare panties that she had to give her?  I never heard of the spare panties.  Oh, it's hilarious, man.  The janitor would come in with the sawdust.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And put it under her chair.  Oh, and it was just like the...  What is up with that?  It's a puddle of, yeah, pee, right?  Dude, there was a girl, and we were all sitting in class, and it was very quiet,  and, you know, all you hear are the pencils on paper in the classroom,  and we just heard, like, the running water, water running off of a seat. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  And we looked around.  Everyone, like, starts looking around, and there she is, the girl,  just sitting there with this yellow stream pooled up in her seat in her little elementary school plastic chair  and dripping onto the floor.  And everyone just starts, oh.  We had one of those, too.  She was just talking.  Her name was Rosemary.  Rosemary?  I won't give away her last name because I don't remember it.  I would love to call her out.  The teacher's got to come over now and, okay, students, back to work, back to work.  Right, right, try to calm the situation.  Okay, come here. 
[02:40:00]  And then she's crying.  Rosemary's crying, and then the teacher walks her out with these little pair of panties  because now she's soiled herself.  Oh.  And Rosemary was known as the girl that peed in, like, second and third grade  and also was known as the girl that struck out in kickball.  Oof.  How do you strike out in kickball?  Oh.  And then you see her at, like, my high school reunion, right?  She's a hot piece of ass.  Oh, boy.  But she will always be known in this circle as the girl that peed her pants in class 
[02:40:30]  and struck out in kickball.  That's what happens.  There were guys that would throw up in class or girls that throw up,  and you're the puke guy, you know, for the rest of eternity.  My first attempt at sarcasm, I was a little boy.  I had a crush on little Kelly Howell.  Remember her name?  Oh.  Oh, little Kelly.  I had a crush on her.  And I had a horrible habit of only being able to go to the bathroom at home.  I could never go in school.  And I would always dump in my pants.  Always.  I told you one time I was walking.  Dude, I mean, nightmare proportions. 
[02:41:00]  Wait, how old were you when you were dumping in your pants?  Second or third grade.  Third grader, you're dumping in your pants.  Constantly.  But I remember.  You have to sit knowing those logs are in there until you go home.  On a side note, before I get back to the Kelly Howell one time,  it just smelled like rust.  I'd have been sitting there for hours.  It was like after you do it and you sit and you can feel it cool.  It's cool against your cheeks.  Oh, God.  And she was standing behind me and I was, like, really nervous because she was there.  And she's like, did you go poops in your pants? 
[02:41:30]  And I was like, yeah, sure.  I tried to be sarcastic, although I was honest.  One time I was in sixth grade.  You should never have one story, let alone two.  Dude, I have 50.  Me and my friend Billy D'Angelo used to walk to school together and I stopped by Bill's house.  And I had one coming on.  And, again, I could never use anyone else's bathroom.  I don't know where all this shame about my sister comes from.  So I tried to break it off and stop, but a piece broke off.  And it rolled down my pant leg and I kicked it out and Bill saw it and left. 
[02:42:00]  What a guy.  He laughed.  Yeah, I was like a rocket.  Duty diva.  You're like, that was a defense mechanism for you.  It actually went 40 yards, so too bad I wasn't playing football this weekend.  Yeah, for the Jets.  The O.B. and Anthony Schell.  Oh, my God.  There's a part two to the Norton Duty story?  Of course.  I thought that was going to be it.  There were so many unanswered questions in part one.  And I'm looking forward to part two.  Well, it was kind of like a cliffhanger.  Yeah.  Well, all right, the log is half out. 
[02:42:30]  What happens next?  What happens?  Will it fall on our Caped Crusader's face?  I hope this is better than Caddyshack 2.  So, it's Duty Stories 2.  Yeah, this is more of that.  I'll just shut up and play the tape.  You're right.  Because you're talking during the tape.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, you are.  Okay.  I'm listening.  Shh.  Shh.  Quiet.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Are you breathing?  Learning way too much about Jim Norton during the break. 
[02:43:00]  That was a fun little bathroom trip.  We really just got to bring audio equipment to the bathroom,  because that's when Jimmy really starts confessing.  I'm confessing.  Did he say he has vivid memories of making it in his pants 60 to 70 times?  Yeah.  I don't have 70 memories, but I can remember.  It got so bad.  And I was probably in 6th or 7th grade.  And it was all dumps in your pants?  Wait, 6th or 7th grade now?  Yeah, what I would do is, I hated using public restrooms.  Wait, wait, you were still dumping in your pants in 6th grade?  Not like I just didn't know what was happening, but I would try to hold it, 
[02:43:30]  and sometimes a little piece would come out.  Oh, man.  But I can remember standing under my sink.  My mother's like, I'm not doing it anymore.  And I had the water running and soap in the water, and I was scrubbing it,  cleaning my own white, tighty-whities like I lived on Little House in the Prairie.  This is 1979.  Going down to the river and beating it on a rock.  I really am an ass.  With a stick.  Oh, that's awful.  Maybe some therapist can call in.  Because I used to hate going to the bathroom.  I would kind of, like, just kneel by my bed, and when I would have to, 
[02:44:00]  I would hold it for as long as I could, just kneeling in my bed.  Even in your house?  Oh, yeah.  I would, like, just kneel by my bed, and, like, I'd be kneeling like I was praying,  but I wasn't praying.  I was kind of reading on the bed, and I would just kind of, like, zone out and hold it.  Don't ask me what that means.  I don't know.  You can't just, you couldn't just walk into the bathroom in your own house?  No.  No, no, it wasn't a fear of that.  I just, I don't know.  There was something cool about holding it.  Oh, okay.  Now it's something completely different.  Yeah, yeah, that was a totally different scenario.  That was just, it was...  Something cool about holding it. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, it's like the way, it was like, it was a weird zone out going to.  Why didn't Helen help you out with this?  I don't know.  Maybe Jimmy's cape one time got a log on it, and Helen got mad.  But I, uh, now, it hasn't translated into now.  What happened to you as a kid?  I need to know.  There's a stranger walking around right now with, with, you know,  because I was a little blonde boy.  I'll bring you in baby pictures.  I was a little, believe me, if you like kids,  I wanted to molest myself when I saw baby pictures.  How could anybody not touch me?  Little stomach I had at Avalon when I was a boy. 
[02:45:00]  That's, I need to know what happened.  And I wouldn't even blame whoever did it.  I deserved it.  You did.  Running around with my blonde locks, adorable face, begging for it.  You have pictures of, of young Jimmy on, uh, your website.  Eatabullet.com.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's, I got a plug.  It's automatic.  Eatabullet.com has, uh, little pictures.  Little Jimmy grows up.  So you can see little Jimmy's pictures, uh, on that website.  It truly is an unsolved mystery, though.  And as you look at his cute little pictures,  just think there was probably a steaming hot load of crap in his pants. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  As I force a smile because it's almost over.  Unsolved mystery.  What's in Jimmy's pants?  Who touched Jimmy as a kid?  Who touched little Jimmy Norton?  We need your help.  Please go to the website and look at his picture.  If it looks familiar, call us.  Let us know if you're the reason he dumped in his pants for so many years. 
[02:46:00]  Unsolved mysteries.  Why did Jimmy find it so traumatic to use a bathroom,  but now he likes being used as a bathroom?  These mysteries and more must be solved with the help of our viewers.  Cute little Jimmy.  He'll be the cute little blonde boy with a little lump in the back of his pants. 
[02:46:30]  Not to be confused with the messy-haired kid with a big lump in the front of his pants.  It certainly is a mystery.  It all started with a touch somewhere.  Believe me, I'm not...  You really don't know?  No, I'll tell you.  Please.  I suspect that, too, just because I show all the signs.  But I really do have no memories of it.  So it's like, I could have been...  Freaky pervert is what you are.  I was a little dirty boy.  I told you I used to act out sexually.  So I'm wondering if it's just one of those things where I was experimenting at that age, 
[02:47:00]  and I'm an addict, so anything that was weird or whatever, I was hooked on immediately.  Yeah.  I had a sexual addiction from the time I was a kid.  Wow.  It may not have been brought on by an adult.  It may have just been me and some little dumbbell exploring.  I told you, I still remember Julie, her ass...  I'm an ass freak.  And I tried to get her to sit on my little second-grade lap, and she didn't want to.  So I'm like, all right, well, here are some sticker bushes.  You could sit on my lap, or you could sit on the sticker bushes, and she sat in the sticker bushes.  And that set a pattern for old Jim Norton and his relationship with women. 
[02:47:30]  I lost out to sticker bushes, and I wonder why my self-esteem is awful.  Ah.  Yeah.  Janice, I remember Janice putting her hiding in my face in the woods.  Devil's Creek and Edison.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Help!  If everybody had a porch across the USA,  Then everybody'd be playing  The game of Monster Rain  You'd see them dropping their trousers  You know we can't abstain 
[02:48:00]  A bushy, bushy young scrotum  Playing Monster Rain  You'll catch me sucking off Jimmy  We're sucking all damn day  But just because we like blowing  That doesn't make us gay  All over my t-shirt  And oozing down the drain  Everybody is playing  Playing Monster Rain 
[02:48:30]  We're taking off our tighty-whities  Here in the pouring rain  We're waxing down our members  And f***ing out our brains  All under the front porch  We're gonna leave a stain  Tell the teacher we're playing  Playing Monster Rain  Imagine Jim going to his mom  Mom going outside to play Monster Rain  Monster Rain  Okay, Jimmy, have fun 
[02:49:00]  So Monster Rain, if the rain hit you, something bad would happen  So you'd have to get out of the rain, right?  Drink out of this  It's an antidote for Monster Rain  Help!  I'm here  The doctor's here  Wow  What a sick, twisted little  Classic  Little boy  Playing Monster Rain  The three strikes law gets tested next week  Elo's listening right now  I don't care  O&A go live before the Boston home opener 
[02:49:30]  It's baseball  It's life  It's  I got nothing  XM Satellite Radio  Celebrating the first free week of O&A  Whoops  Sorry  Yeah  Opie and Anthony are overpaid  But then again  So is Bob Edwards  The XM  PR  Ghoul  Ha ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Oh yes  The virus is now free 
[02:50:00]  Opie and Anthony  Do you ever think about when you were on the air  And you guys were syndicated nationally before  But that you're truly covering every inch of the United States  And Canada  And Mexico  Plus you are now worldwide on XM Radio dot com on the web  Yeah I just wish we could block out Alabama  Yeah  Judging from their phone calls  Jesus Christ  We thought it was a good thing until we took that first call from Alabama  We don't know if that guy was retarded or if that's how they speak down there 
[02:50:30]  A whole new country down there  Does anyone speak Alabama in this room?  Alabaman  Alabamian  Yeah  You know I don't think you sit here and think about it  Kind of cool  But I don't think you crack the mic and go  Oh my god  Get me a map  A geographical survey map of where we're broadcasting to  You know you see it on the phone  So all of a sudden it'll pop up  And you'll get a weird place that comes up on the phone  So yeah it's cool to be national  Yeah  It sunk in for me when I was out in LA  I had my MiFi  And I was listening to you know the show in Hollywood  I was like oh okay  I guess we are doing something cool now 
[02:51:00]  Yeah  The potential is there  It's just going to get bigger  I mean every market is going to grow in  And it's nice to not have to grovel for those Viacom jizz buckets  And beg for a new market  When they have just awful programming already on them  But they're too afraid that this show is going to explode  And cause a problem  So it's just nice to see that you know  You're on every market already  All you've got to do is just be good  And you'll build up  Yeah  End of quote  It sure clears things up doesn't it  The worst  The worst of Opie and Anthony 
[02:51:30]  It's just sad  Oh my god Frankie Blue Anthony  Frankie Blue  Oh yeah  Time for the Frankie Blue audio  Radio legend Frankie Blue  Yeah he was in charge of WNEW  Our old station in New York  For a little while  Had a couple of months there  And he pretty much blew his career there  With this little move  Getting drunk and going on the air  And being hilarious  After a Christmas party  Yeah  And the best part about this  He was supposed to be the responsible one 
[02:52:00]  Right  He's the boss  Getting hammered  And just saying silly things on the air  Here's part one  One  Part one of the Frankie Blue audio  It's the worst  So you think this is funny  The Frankie Blue thing  I do  I love it  Anytime you can  It's very voyeuristic  Even though it's going out  To a bunch of people on the radio  I think this is very voyeuristic  It's an uncomfortable situation  It's somebody put in a position  They shouldn't have been in  Well I guess what happened 
[02:52:30]  Our old radio station  WNEW  Yeah  There's a curse with our old station  Ever since we left  Absolutely  Ever since we left  It's just been in the toilet  They can't figure out what to do  With the station  And it's just failing miserably  Ratings are always in the toilet  They have tried  How many different formats?  They've tried three or four  Since we left  Yep  And the one that did the best  Was the three months  That they played Christmas music  Last year  They started like at Halloween  And played it through New Year 
[02:53:00]  And it did better than any format  They put on there  Well our old company  They hired this dope John Sykes  Who was supposed to help the radio division  And the radio division has been a disaster  Ever since he took the helm  And now they're just kind of paying him  And he's like in a little office  And no one bothers him  Because he's under contract  And they're going to fire him real soon  But he had no business  Trying to run the radio division of Viacom  Got to bump Joel Hollander up into that position  He's the genius  Joel Hollander is an amazing radio guy  And he will right the ship 
[02:53:30]  But this guy John Sykes  Which is just a waste of space  An asshole  A two faced fuck  You know he told Anthony and I  When we did the Sex with Sam thing  That crazy haired dick  That we were going to be okay  He said we were going to be okay  And then all of a sudden  He just blew us off  Never talked to us again  And then just hid behind lawyers  And you know  And his secretary and stuff  Never could get him on the phone again  And we find out how he didn't like the show  Didn't like what we were doing  That's the type of executive you want  Running your radio division  A guy that doesn't have balls 
[02:54:00]  And will tell you to your face  What's going on you know  Oh didn't he think it was bad for kids  The show  Yeah  Yeah  So you know  He thought he knew what he was doing  And we get fired  And the station has been  A complete disaster ever since  And the radio division  Quite frankly  Has been a complete disaster ever since  They lost millions upon millions of dollars  And in the end  It was John Sykes' fault  Simple as that  Joel Hollander wasn't running the radio division back then  He just  No he wasn't  And anyway  It's unheard of in radio history  To have a station 
[02:54:30]  That has been floundering for as long as any W  It just doesn't happen  When that happens at a station  They fix it  They fix the problem  Right  Especially in New York  Right  It's the number one mark in the country  Right  You can't have a radio property  Just sitting there  With a  One rating  And a history like any W has  Yeah  It's in last place  There are radio stations  That don't even  Have a signal  A strong signal  In Manhattan  That are beating  Our old station  Easy listening music stations  From Long Island  Beat it out  Right  It's ridiculous 
[02:55:00]  So getting back to the  Frankie Blue thing  In our old radio station  That has just been in the toilet  Ever since we left  Falling apart  Because they really thought  They knew what they were doing  By firing us  And moving on  Oh yeah  They figured they would compete  With other stations  That are doing very well  Around New York  Because boy  There's a win situation  Go head to head  Against stations  That are just  Entrenched in the market  Have great ratings  Doing what they're doing  Because people will just  Change their habits  Like that  For the same thing  They could get  In the place that they've been 
[02:55:30]  For years and years and years  Now RuPaul is what  Their morning person now  Weren't there  Was RuPaul  Person  That's good  Oh whatever  Yeah  Morning guy  It's a guy  Morning parental disappointment  When I  It's RuPaul the drag queen  Does mornings over there  When I sit there  And you have to listen  To some people go  RuPaul she is so pretty  It's got a cock  It's a guy  Boy you're a buzz kill  So then  Big smooth back  So then the old company 
[02:56:00]  Gets the bright idea  To hire this Frankie Blue guy  Because he was  He was really good  At KTU I guess  What was KTU  Kind of like a  Dance mix station  Yeah kind of like  Commercial dance music  Like dance music  So they're like  Well we'll hire the guy  That made KTU great  Uh huh  And we'll  We'll put him on  N.E.W.  And he'll have the same  Success over here  Right  Well so far  He hasn't done anything  Except get drunk  At Christmas gatherings  Oh  And Earl was there too 
[02:56:30]  Yeah our old pal  Earl was here  Earl  Was there I should say  And Earl did not  Give us his tape  I want to get on  I want to go on the record  And tell you  He did not  Have anything to do  With the tape  We're about to play  Right  He didn't  Okay  So Frankie Blue  Was at the  Christmas luncheon  A couple days ago  A Christmas luncheon  They did a Christmas luncheon  And I guess  Everyone got  Completely hammered  I would too  If I was working over there  As a matter of fact  I did  Many times  Yeah  He got destroyed  Everyone else  And with the ratings  That just came out 
[02:57:00]  I think he had  A few extra shots  Because he's probably  Thinking oh my god  I'm a fraud  At this point  Oh boy  So then he goes back  To the station  And he gets into  Some kind of argument  With the DJ  That was supposed to  Go on the air  Now if he was  A little tipsy  At the time  I'm thinking  It probably wasn't  One of those  Good legitimate arguments  Where you have a point  I've been in arguments  With drunk people  They don't usually  Make good points  During arguments  You ever notice that?  What is that?  Why you gotta wear  That fucking shirt?  Oh there's a good  Good argument  This one will last 
[02:57:30]  About 18 hours straight  Yeah  So that's what he does  He goes over there  Gets in a little tiff  And it's the DJ  That's supposed to  Go on the air  She pretty much  Runs out of the station  Crying or something  I don't know  I wasn't there  Oh boy  But something  Happened and she  Just ran out  So now  Someone has to do  The radio show  So who do they  Get to do the show?  Well Frankie Blue  Is the boss over there  He decides  Oh fuck her  I'll just do it  He's gonna take the mic  Oh he's not a DJ?  He's not on air? 
[02:58:00]  He's the program guy  He's a legendary  Quote programmer  Here in New York  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary  He is in a minute here  And then he goes  Oh fuck I don't need her  I'll just do her shift  And I'll do probably  A better job  Now he's doing it  For WNEW  During this  He's talking about  KTU  Which is their  Arch rival in competition  He's just  He's just  He's using the  KTU call letters  He makes a mistake  And actually says  You know  On  1027WKTU 
[02:58:30]  KTU  And it's N.E.W.  Yeah that's the station  They're trying to beat  Yeah  Oops  Oh they must have been  Loving this at KTU  I bet they play this  And just laugh their balls  So Ben  Has been playing this  All morning in the office  Just laughing like  Like an idiot  Like Ben  I think it's hilarious  Yeah  Yeah  And Earl's there  You know  Earl jumps on the air  Earl was the  Earl was the producer  Board op  Yeah  He's the board op guy  The girl that does the show  Is supposed to do that  And Earl hits the buttons  When she goes to commercials  And stuff like that  He operates the board  Yeah  So he had to board op 
[02:59:00]  For Frankie  Who's all hammered  Right  And who's his boss  And who's his boss  So Earl  I guess you hear him  Chime in a couple of times  I guess just out of nervousness  And you know  He must have been  Sitting there going  Oh my god  This guy's hammered  He can't even talk  He's stammering  He's forgetting words  He hiccups in one word  And it makes the word  Two words  Yeah  And Earl's just like  You can tell  He's really nervous  And then you gotta  Understand too  This is one of those  Radio stations  Where you talk really  Quickly between the music 
[02:59:30]  The music's the most important thing  If you're talking  More than 30 seconds  You're not doing your job  He's talking for about  Four minutes here  Oh I know  We cut it down  But we'll play about  Two and a half minutes  Of this  But he's just babbling  About nothing  Saying the wrong call letters  This is the boss of the radio station  That was supposed to put  WNEW back on the map  Here you go  In New York radio  The boss  So here  You know  I gotta be honest  If they got Frankie Blue  Drunk every day  To do a radio show  Oh yeah  The ratings would go  Through the roof  I'd listen every day  Absolutely 
[03:00:00]  And I hate that type of music  But that's the type of thing  They should do  Just get drunks on the air  Drunk DJs  Drunk DJs  Uh huh  I love this  This is the fucking boss  He's fucking hammered  And don't think for a second  That this is some kind of  Relaxed laid back delivery  Yeah this is not radio  From the 70s  No  All the DJs were encouraged  To talk like this  This guy's hammered  This is the type of station  Where you know  Your voice has to be  Way up there  Like WKTU

[03:06:00]  Is screwing up those calls  And especially when you screw them up  By replacing them  With the competition's call letters  Right  He's supposed to  For people all over the country  Say WNEW  Right  But it says KTU  Which is their arch rival  Pick the two stations in your city  That battle it out between each other  And picture one of the jocks  Being drunk  And making the mistake  Of using the other station's call  So here's the boss  At our old station  I'd drink too  If I was the boss  Over at that shithole  Completely hammered  Ratings are in the toilet 
[03:06:30]  He has to go on the air  He thought he could handle it  And this is some more of him  Doing his little show  Mix 1027  The new Mix 1027  This is Frankie Blue  And I am so excited  For tomorrow  Like all the old Foster Brooks  I'm so excited  For tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  A drunken hiccup 
[03:07:00]  Comes out of him  In mid-word  Nice buzz, man  Wow  That must have been  A great Christmas luncheon  Must have been  Luncheon  What time was this going on?  I guess  Luncheon  He's on the air  At the 7 to 12 shift  At night  So the luncheon  Was probably  You know what  Noon, 1  Noon to 3, 4 maybe  Love the nooners, man  Pounding them  During the nooners  Here we go  This is Frankie Blue  And I am so excited  For tomorrow  I got Ricky and Rue 
[03:07:30]  Coming in in the morning  Putting a hand  In the big old barrel  Picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo  Oh, there it is  Winner of the KTU Mix 102  Oh, where the hell do I work? 
[03:08:00]  Is he going to start singing Janis Joplin tunes?  Wow  Oh my god  This doesn't sound like just alcohol  By the way  That's my opinion  Dude, this sounds like you're fired  Yeah  This is a firing offense  Yeah, because this is the guy  This is the boss  This isn't some stupid DJ  That has a coke problem  She should be  That you're trying to  You know, take care of  What?  She should be fired  For walking off the shift  What kind of the boss?  Dude, they told her to leave  Or did she just leave? 
[03:08:30]  It just shows you that the old place  Is still a fucking train wreck  Yeah, it is  It's a dump  Yeah, smart move  Getting rid of Opie and Anthony  The only thing that was happening over there  Even when you were there  It stunk  Except for Ron and Fez  Those guys did okay  Well, us and Ron and Fez  You know, we kept the ship going  Yep  They were making a lot of money  Off our show and Ron and Fez  They should have  They should have backed us  Instead, they got this mess  Two years later  They still  Two and a half years later  They still have nothing  Some of the most entertaining programming  I've ever heard  Out of that station  Right here  I would put this guy on the air 
[03:09:00]  Every day drunk  Every day drunk  I would listen every freaking day  And he's, quote, a legend  In New York radio  Wow  A fiery wreck  Today on our wreck cam  Boy, that's a bad one  That is a bad one today  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning  If he's up yet  Oh my God  When you wake up sober  And you'll hear it  All hungover  Shaking  Feeling a little nauseous  Your head is pounding  And your phone's ringing  Frankie  Yeah, Frankie, pick up 
[03:09:30]  Pick up  Yeah, I heard your  I heard your air shift  What are you stupid  You fucking drunk  You get a call from Infinity yet  You will  Yeah, you will  Take a couple of aspirin  And get your ass out of bed  Because I'm sure you'll be in a meeting today  Can you say fired?  Fired  Yeah, call up  I'll be an Anthony  They'll give you some pointers  On what to do  During your time off  You idiot 
[03:10:00]  And it's not like nobody's heard this clip  This clip just hasn't been circulating through the radio circles all morning  You know  It's like  Dude, I emailed it to everybody this morning  Hi, Frankie  Frankie, it's your mom  Hi  How you doing?  Dr. Phil said  When you give something up  To replace it with something else  So  It was good to see you giving up the NEW call letters  And replacing it with the KTU call letters  You stupid fuck  I'm your mother so I can say that  Come on over  We'll do shots  I love you  Oh, isn't that great? 
[03:10:30]  There's just a little more here  I hear this  I gotta hear the KTU thing again  I hear there's a third clip  No, no  This is it  No, this is the  Rumor has it there's a third clip  Well, I think this  At this point is when he was removed  After this break  He was removed from the station  Who removed him?  The general manager  Oh  Oh, that is not good  The GM came in and took him off the air  He's the Mac Daddy  At every radio station  Holy shit  Doesn't go much higher than the GM  Who finished the shift?  I would assume they probably just played music 
[03:11:00]  Probably just played music  And Earl pushed the button  That's good  When your big boss has to  Come into the studio  And you're supposed to be in charge  Of all your DJs  And tell you to get the fuck off  Yeah  Get off  You had it  You are so fired  Go home  Fired  Come out like the manager  Going to the mound  Just get out  Get out  Do you got the KTU line in there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I gotta hear him screw up on the calls again  Yeah  He's supposed to say WNEW once again  As winner  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest 
[03:11:30]  Oh  And also you win a Toyota Scion  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull  They're going to put their hand in the barrel  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  And that winner will be rewarded with everything  I open my heart  Mix 102 7  He's stepping all over  He's supposed to be done by the time those lyrics kick in  That is like the most important thing in that type of radio 
[03:12:00]  That type of radio?  Man, you gotta hit the post  Yeah, like the...  It's called hit the post  Right, exactly  What did he say?  We're going to fuck the winner?  That sounded like it  Oh, is that where they thought he cursed?  Yeah  I didn't even notice that until we just listened to it  Toyota Scion  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull  They're going to put their hand in the barrel  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  Fight?  What?  What was that? 
[03:12:30]  I think he said fuck  They're going to fuck that winner  I think he was going to say fuck and was able to stop just in time  Fight that winner  Wait, that's not a word  They're going to put their hand in the barrel  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  Fight  And that winner will be rewarded with everything  Mix 1067, Frankie Blue, what's happening?

[03:14:00]  Fired  How long has he been there?  Not too long, man  He was supposed to be the big hire  That was going to turn around that  Crap hole  That was it  He was going to be the guy  At the turnpike, that big fire  Jersey turnpike  You know what that's got to be doing to traffic  Oh, boy  Oh, boy  We have audio  Ridgefield  General manager coming in  To Frankie Blue  You're fired  Do you have the audio of Frankie Blue  After he was fired?

[03:16:00]  That's right, baby  O.P. Anthony Dance Party Weekend  Wait, wait, wait, wait  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah  The O.P. and Anthony Show  Comedy Gone Too Far  If you're listening right now  I think you just heard the first part of the Frankie Blue audio, right?  So it would be very obvious at this point to just play part two of Frankie Blue  And why would we have to, you know, explain it again? 
[03:16:30]  Because you should have been listening a little while ago, right?  Yeah, yeah  So just listen to part two of the Frankie Blue audio  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony  That's terrific  That's terrific  That's terrific  Okay, terrific  That's terrific  Okay, terrific  Okay, terrific 
[03:17:00]  I'm being honest, I don't know anything  Okay, terrific  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  All right  Got a few updates  Wow  Because this show is a soap opera  We know that  Yeah  The saga that is Frankie Blue  Is over, Anthony  Oh, yes  Is over  Hopefully we replayed the Frankie Blue stuff  In some of the worst of  In the past few days 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah, we did  We did?  Thursday  Oh, good  So a lot of people know what we're talking about here then  Because we got a lot of new listeners through the holiday  Frankie Blue  Frankie Blue, baby  Frankie blew up his spot there at N.E.W.  Blue, you're my boy  You're my boy, Blue  Thanks for all the great radio  Sorry you got fired  You're my boy, Blue  You're my boy, Blue  Oh  You're my boy  I don't have one today  Oh, hold on  Well, because I'm using your thing for this 
[03:18:00]  For the porno  Hold on  Now you're back  You're fired  Blue, you're my boy  You're fired  You're my boy, Blue  So you want to explain Frankie Blue really fast, Anthony?  Yeah, Frankie Blue was the program director  You know, the boss  Over there at the station we used to work at  W.N.E.W. in New York  And they do like  What would you call that music? 
[03:18:30]  Music  That gay guys play when they're having sex  Yeah, you could call it that  I don't know what it is  It's like that dance type music  Like music that dopey chicks put on in their car all the time  Just that crap  What's a good example, like a song that they would play?  I don't know  I'm just trying to like  So people get the grasp of the type of station it is  To know that it's not like this  Where you could come on drunk  People have 
[03:19:00]  You know  And get away with it  It's not that type of thing  It's very fast delivery  That the jocks give  And Frankie Blue was at a Christmas party  Got a little tanked, it seemed  Went back to his station  And got in a little argument  With the girl that was supposed to be coming on the air  And that's what they're saying he got fired for  Right  It's just for the argument  But he figures now  She's gone  He threw her out of there that day  Now he was going to take to the airwaves  And show the talent that is Frankie Blue 
[03:19:30]  All hammered from the Christmas party  He gets on just slurring and stumbling through the show  That he was doing  And then I think  And the worst thing I think that he did  He called WNEW WKTU  Which is the competitor  Of the station  So it kind of  It really looked bad  You're not supposed to be the boss doing that  And at the time  We got a hold of this tape  And exploited it to the max  Of course we did  And now there's radio guys all over the country 
[03:20:00]  That have copies of this  And they're playing it for each other  They think it's one of the greatest things ever  I've talked to more radio guys  That said  Oh my god  I'm sending this to everybody  And all the guys in radio  Were playing it  And listening to it  Like it was the funniest thing ever  Because we love when people screw up  Especially when it has something to do with our old station  Yep  Another program director losing his job at our old station  Yeah  They've been through a lot of them since we left  It's been an abomination since they unjustly booted you guys  That is correct sir 
[03:20:30]  An abomination in the biggest radio market in the country  Yeah  And that station has been an abomination for the last two and a half years  You wouldn't see  An embarrassment  You wouldn't see a station this screwed up in a 200 market  You wouldn't see it  And this is the number one market in the country  And it has been just a mess for you  A disaster  A legendary station  After the music went down  They put you guys on  And you're the only thing on the station 
[03:21:00]  And then Ron and Fez start to do very well  Of course there's no morning show  Because they don't want to compete with Howard in New York  So they put nothing on in the morning  It's just an embarrassment man  It has been  And the revolving door of program directors that have gone through there  If you take that gig  You're insane  Because you're not going to be the one that straightens it out  There is no quick fix for that place  And they're not in it for the long haul  So you're just done  There's no quick fix  But they don't want to wait for a longer solution to take place 
[03:21:30]  So they just keep firing the people that can't fix it quick enough  Or they get drunk on the air  At least that was an original firing  The past bosses of program directors that have been through there  Have been fired because it just hasn't worked out  They can't get the station going  And now they've got some new guy  I thought Steve had gotten a new job over at NEW when I read this  It says Martini returns to NEW as PD  It's Rick Martini I guess  I thought they meant Martini Steve 
[03:22:00]  Yeah Rick Martini  A 25 year radio veteran  Did a lot with his career obviously  You know what's wrong with 25 year radio veterans  He's going to bring nothing new to NEW  Nothing new  A 25 year veteran uses all the stuff he's learned over 25 years  Which is the same old crap  That no one wants to listen to  It's not new  It's not cutting edge  It's not something people are going to tune into 
[03:22:30]  And go wow this is something  I've got to hear this  Because they'll hear it elsewhere  No one's going to switch  If you could go to KTU  Which is the other station that plays this kind of crap  Do we have one of those songs?  Do we actually have one?  They play this?  Are you kidding me?  Isn't this Donna Summer?  Donna Summer  Last Dance  Hey baby  It's Frankie Blue  It's Don  Don Summer  And we're going to  And we're going to 
[03:23:00]  We're going to listen to this last dance  Last dance Earl  Dance with me Earl  You're working my board for me today  It's Frankie Blue baby  Let me tell you something  We're here at WKY  WKY  Right  KTU  Where are we?  Any double dip  Or double shit  W  WLSD  Oh no that's right  I took before I came in  W  Give me another drink here  Merry Christmas everyone  W  E  E  E  Oh no that's something else I took before I came in today 
[03:23:30]  I'm sorry  Frankie Blue baby  You know this is a Christmas party I won't forget very soon  The Christmas party that got me fired  And I didn't even copy my sack and asshole in the copy machine  And I still got in trouble for a Christmas party  Frankie Blue  Why?  Well I needed the money  Oh that's terrific  Frankie Blue  Frankie Blue his job up  Welcome to WHIV  Wait wait  That's just people that enjoy this music  Come on 
[03:24:00]  Let's dance baby  Let's dance  Hey I just said that  I'd like to take Donna Summer  And fuck  Donna Summer  Donna Summer  Yeah here on KZU  We got our big contest going  We're going to win at Sky On  What are we winning?  I don't know  Tune in to Frankie Blue  For the next five minutes  Because that's all I'll be here  Before they throw my drunk ass out  RuPaul's going to take his big manly hands  And  Reads into Donna Summer's box 
[03:24:30]  I mean  What a mess you was that day  I'm going to do a little riff  You know  Because I'm Frankie Blue  And  You know  We got RuPaul in here  I was in the bathroom  What a huge horse cock  On that black guy  Let me tell you  What a huge horse cock  What?  Are we on the arrow?  Uh oh  And you know the station  The on air talent  Did not address it honestly  You know they didn't goof on it  Once it happened  Just don't talk about it  Just pretend it didn't happen  Make believe it didn't happen 
[03:25:00]  Until we fire you  That's pretty much what radio does  Well because we said it earlier  I mean  They've taken the fun out of radio  Everyone has taken this whole thing  So seriously  No spontaneity  It's just radio  It's the stupidest job in America  Yeah  And no one has a sense of humor anymore  If this happens on your radio station  You gotta go with it  I agree with you baby  Frankie Blue agrees with you  Corporate people  Are talentless  Humorless  Faggots  And they ruin  Everything they touch  That is creative  Yeah  Every time corporations  Get involved with creativity 
[03:25:30]  You ruin it  Shut up  Oh sorry  Try to soak everybody  Louder  Flashback  I'm sorry  Yeah baby  On the new KTU  How long has this station been around  Why do we still call it new  Yeah  Frankie Blue here  Get me another god damn drink  Woo blue  You're my boy  Oh that's me  You're not funny  You're not interesting  And that's why when things like this happen  You don't know what to do with it  You just clam up  And pretend it didn't happen  Fire it  96 
[03:26:00]  Was when they were the new KTU  Alright  They still call themselves the new  So there's the Frankie Blue update  He got fired for the audio we're about to play  So he yells and screams at the poor girl that was supposed to be on the air  Whatever her name is  She's some legend too I guess  Whatever  She still got a job there?  I guess  Yeah  I thought maybe they'd just eliminate the entire problem  You know sometimes just flush it out  Make like it never happened  We don't have to look at her  We don't have to think about him  You know they kind of do that sometimes 
[03:26:30]  But I'm sure she would sue  Oh yeah  And probably rightfully so  Someone says he manhandled her  I don't know if he did or not  He shoved her out  I have some respect for him now  I would too  I'm going to show her who's boss  Yeah  Something he used to be  He thought he was big enough  Show her who used to be boss  He thought he was big enough to go on the air  And do a radio shift  And we got our hands on the audio  Yeah baby  Here's Frankie Blue  Blowing up his career baby  Here it is  End of the  I love this  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw
