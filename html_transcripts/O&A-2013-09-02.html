<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an improvised scene featuring the hosts and in-studio guests Paul, Henry, Andrew, and Frenchie.  Their skit, based on a mis-transcribed movie scene (possibly from *The Oklahoma Kid* or *Shane*), devolved into a comedic recreation of *Jaws*, with roles assigned to themselves and additional guests Big A and Pat from Anaki.  The recurring theme of misinterpreted movie dialogue fueled much of the humor.

This was followed by a highly offensive segment about a band fronted by a man with Down syndrome.  The hosts and callers made numerous disparaging jokes about the band’s music and the singer’s appearance and abilities, interspersing audio clips of their music and interviews with crude commentary and listener-submitted jokes.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of MySpace, focusing on the pressures of maintaining a popular profile, the "top eight" friend system, and the absurdity of online friendships.  Jim Norton joined the conversation, expressing frustration at not being in Anthony Cumia's top eight, leading to a humorous exchange about online social hierarchies.  Norton added friends live on air, commenting on their profiles, while callers shared their opinions, some expressing dislike for the platform. Bill Burr called in, resulting in a humorous exchange hinting at a conflict involving Anthony's chef.  A caller described Anthony's MySpace profile.  The discussion concluded with a brief mention of a guest's short film discovered through MySpace.

A significant portion of the broadcast then covered the paranormal, specifically focusing on Bobby Mackey's Music World in Kentucky.  Callers shared ghost stories, and a purportedly genuine ghost encounter was played, with hosts and callers debating its authenticity. A caller identifying himself as "ghost hunter" Ted contributed humorous anecdotes. The hosts and callers engaged in comedic speculation about how "scratching" sounds on the recording might have been faked.

The show veered into a discussion about the disproportionate impact of natural disasters on poor white communities, using highly offensive and racially charged language.  The hosts speculated on the reasons, attributing it to poor settlement choices rather than racism in urban planning, using inflammatory stereotypes throughout the conversation.  They contrasted this with poor Black communities, further employing offensive language.  The conversation included a historical analysis of American settlement patterns, claiming poor white people repeated the mistakes of earlier settlers while ignoring the ancestral knowledge that had led to safer locations, and even touched on the displacement of Native Americans.  The discussion expanded to include the historical context of slavery and its lasting effects, with continued use of offensive language and stereotypes.

This was followed by a “radio war” segment against the Ron and Fez show, stemming from a stunt involving Cream Pie Jones (an O&A intern, Jared), who was allegedly mistreated by Master Poe (from Ron and Fez).  Audio of a confrontation between Cream Pie Jones and Eastside Dave (from Ron and Fez) was played, culminating in Eastside Dave stripping his shirt, urinating on a picture of Cream Pie Jones, eating it, and defecating.  Pat Duffy, a previous O&A intern known for a previous stunt involving projectile vomiting, was introduced as a new contender, countering with a stunt involving dog feces and stapling paper to his scrotum.  E-Rock's participation involved a toothbrush and an unpleasant-smelling substance.  The hosts declared Pat Duffy the victor.  Commercial breaks were interspersed throughout.

A significant segment featured excerpts from the 1961 film "My Baby is Black," showcasing the racist attitudes and language of the era.  The hosts reacted to the dialogue, focusing on the parents' hateful reactions to their daughter's relationship with a Black man.  A caller, Dave, shared his experience with interracial marriage, and another caller discussed the film's depiction of racism.  The hosts shared childhood anecdotes.

Finally, a "best of" segment from the Ron and Fez show covered the controversy surrounding the million-dollar bounty for Chris Dorner, a rogue former police officer. The discussion centered on the fairness of prioritizing a police officer's life over a civilian's, delving into conspiracy theories and speculation about Dorner's whereabouts.  A San Diego police officer called in.  Numerous commercials, including those featuring Chuck Woolery and Joe Montana, were aired throughout this segment.  The segment concluded with a repetitive echoing of "I see where you're coming from."  Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous commercial breaks for various products and services were included.

[00:03:00]  What?  Where's my fucking drink?  I'll ask you for a drink.  You wanted a drink?  I just asked you for a fucking drink.  I thought you said you were my spider.  No, no, no.  What, you got me on the fucking pain on my list, kid?  No, because I thought I heard someone say something.  Spider.  Spider.  I thought it was Henry. 
[00:03:30]  Spider, spider.  You know you're a fucking mumbling, stirring little fuck.  You know that?  No, I thought you said I was all right, spider.  No, you ain't all right, spider.  You've got a lot of fucking problems.  No, I thought you said you were all right, spider.  That's too good.  I am all right.  You ain't all right, you little fucking prick.  That's what?  I thought that what you said.

[00:05:00]  Don't make a big fang out of it, spider.  You little prick.  You're going to make me think.  What'd I do here?  It was an accident.  Great job by Andrew, paying attention.  Both of those bones are shattered.  Yeah, very nice.  How about this next time we just get scripts and actually read off the scripts?  Yes.  That's a good idea because the transcription stinks.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Which one did he get wrong in here, too?  Oh, he did something here that made me just want to fucking smash his fingers.  Hey, do we have any scripts with women? 
[00:05:30]  Why don't we bring the women in?  Oh, right.  We have Pulp Fiction.  We have Jaws.  We didn't think of that.  We have Reservoir Dogs.  Who didn't think of that?  Back to schools.  Nah, we want more popular scenes, I think, right?  We could use them for Reservoir Dogs.  King of Comedy has two females.  King of Comedy.  I'd rather hear like the Jaws or Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, right?  Yeah.  The ladies might be out.  We'll have to redo it with the ladies. 
[00:06:00]  Which one do you want to go to next, Ant?  Pulp Fiction.  Well, Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies.  Reservoir Dogs or Jaws.  Hooper and Brody talking.  Yeah, that's pretty good, too.  Yeah, that's another good one.  Which movie is this?  Say what again?  Oh, Sino.  All right, Jaws.  Want to go Jaws?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What was that?  Holy shit.  Can we use a girl on a man's part?  No.  You have to hook her.  I like the authenticity.  Yeah.  Let's see. 
[00:06:30]  Well, I think we know who's going to be Quint.  Who?  Andrew?  Of course.  Okay, Andrew, you're Quint.  Ah, look at the huge dialogue, the huge chunk he's got.  That's going to be great.  This will probably end a bit, the Jaws scene.  Then we got, who wants to be Hooper?  Hooper.  Well, we got to give Pat some lines for once.  Yeah.  All right, Pat, you'll be Hooper.  You'll be Hooper.  Who wants to be Brody? 
[00:07:00]  Chief.  Who wants to be Brody?  Frenchy.  Frenchy's Brody.  Yeah.  And Mayor Vaughn.  Mayor Vaughn.  And who else?  Martin?  Martin.  How about Paul can be the mayor?  Oh, we're doing two.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Oh, there's two scenes from the movie.  Oh, all right.  It's a lot easier.  Which scene you want, Anthony?  I'm sorry.  Oh, well, scene two is great because it has Quint's whole dialogue about the sub, but 
[00:07:30]  scene one is fun because it's got Mayor Vaughn talking about the Kittner kid.  I think we got to go with Quint, though.  How about we do both scenes?  We end with the Jaws thing here.  We got enough time?  Yeah, let's end with the Jaws thing.  We'll start with scene two?  We'll start with, no, we'll have time.  Start with scene one, because then that'll be the grand finale when he has to do the whole  Quint speech.  Okay, so who's Hooper?  Yeah, now we just need Hooper and Brody and Mayor Vaughn.  Who would be the best mayor, you think?  Mayor Vaughn in this scene would have to be Big A. 
[00:08:00]  Big A?  Yeah.  All right, Big A is the star of this bit today.  All right, Big A, you're going to be the mayor.  All right, then we got Hooper.  Who's Hooper?  Hooper is...  Pat, we need more lines for Pat, right?  Pat from Monaki.  All right, Pat from Monaki.  And then Frenchie, maybe?  Yeah.  Frenchie is Brody?  Yeah.  All right, here's the original scene.  Martin, there are all kinds of sharks in the water.  You know?  Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.  And the chances that these bozos got the exact shark...  Oh, now there's no other sharks like this in these waters. 
[00:08:30]  Martin, Martin, it's 100 to 1.  100 to 1.  Now, I'm not saying that this is not the shark.  It probably is, Martin.  It probably is.  It's a man-eater.  It's extremely rare for these waters.  But the fact is that the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim.  I just...  I want to be sure.  You want to be sure.  We all want to be sure, okay?  And what I want to do is very simple.  The digestive system of this animal is very, very slow.  Let's cut it open.  Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be in there. 
[00:09:00]  And then we'll be sure.  Maybe the only way to confirm us, huh?  Look, fellas, let's be reasonable, huh?  This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.  And I am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open  and see that little Ketner voice spill out all over the dock.  And there you have it. 
[00:09:30]  Very famous scene from Jaws.  Yes, sir.  First of all, Dummy called it Ketner Boy.  Isn't it Ketner Boy?  Yeah.  And he also spells proform.  Proform, not perform.  And then eaten, he fucking puts an apostrophe after it like it's a slang.  Fucking dope.  Yeah, we'll have to make fun of him on his...  What did he fucking write this with, his fat toes?  All right.  Well, we're running out of time, so we'll have to make do here.  You guys ready to know what parts you're playing? 
[00:10:00]  Let's start with Hooper, which is Pat from Menachie.  Here we go.  Martin, there are all kinds of sharks in the waters, you know?  Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.  And the chance is that these bozos got the exact shark.  Oh, no, there's no shark like this in the water.  Martin, Martin, it's 100 to 1.  100 to 1.  Now, I'm not saying that this is not the shark.  It probably is.  Martin, oh, I skipped a line.  For these waters. 
[00:10:30]  But the fact is that the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim.  I just, I want to be sure.  You want to be sure.  We all want to be sure, okay?  Now, what I want to do is very simple.  The digestive system of this animal is very, very slow.  Let's cut it open.  Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be in there.  And then we'll be sure.  Maybe the only way to confirm it, huh?  Look, fellas, let's be reasonable, huh? 
[00:11:00]  This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish.  But I'm not going to stand here and see that thing cut open and see that little kid and the boy spill out all over the dock. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  You actually hold your breath.  I know.  You end up holding your breath.  Yeah, you hold your breath with him.  Oh, wow.  Bravo.  And Frenchie, no laughing during other people's dialogue, goddammit.  Yeah.  No, you're cackling.  We're trying to hear Big A do his lines.  Now, the next scene, we can't play the whole thing in the original form because we're running out of show.  No, it's long.  Just to give you a little taste, another scene from Jaws. 
[00:12:00]  This one.  What's that one?  What?  That one there on your arm.  Oh, man.  It's a tattoo.  I got that removed.  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  Mother.  What is that?  Tohupa, that's the USS Indianapolis. 
[00:12:30]  You won the Indianapolis?  What happened?  Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief.  Chief.  It was coming back from the island of Tinian to Lady and just delivered the bomb, the Hiroshima bomb.  All right.  And then, obviously, the very famous Quint.  God, is that great.  Yeah.  Monologue, basically, right?  Yeah.  And they're on the boat getting drunk, looking at their scars and their tattoos. 
[00:13:00]  Everyone remembers the scene.  Oh, my God.  This is going to take forever.  I know.  That's why we've got to get right into it.  We've got to get right into it.  So, who's playing Martin in this scene?  I am.  All right.  So, Frenchie's Martin.  Quint is obviously Andrew.  Yes.  It's all about Andrew today.  Hooper.  Paul can be Hooper.  He hasn't had many lines.  Yeah, let's get Paul as Hooper.  Sorry.  All right.  Sorry, Pat.  And there you have it.  So, let's get this Jaws scene going here. 
[00:13:30]  What's that one?  Wait, what?  By the way, Frenchie is the worst.  The worst.  The pause in between.  He's cackling.  He put the apostrophe of the commas in the wrong place.  In the last scene, he was supposed to interrupt, and there was like a three-second pause, and  then he...  Yeah, there's no interruption.  It was awful.  He's dumb.  All right, let's start over.  What's that one?  What?  Wait, he needs a mic.  Nathaniel.  Hold on.  Now we've got to start over again.  You guys have got to work the mics better. 
[00:14:00]  All right, one more time.  Here we go.  Running out of show.  Let's go.  Frenchie.  What's that one?  What?  That one there on your arm.  Uh, well, it's a test.  It's a test, too.  I just, I got that removed.  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  Mother.  What is it?  Hold on.  Did you listen to the clip yet?  There's a big laugh.  But there's a big laugh there.  That's why it says laugh in Peruvian mother.  Mother.  Mother.  All right, back up one line. 
[00:14:30]  Back to Quint.  Don't tell me.  Mom.  Back to Quint.  Mums.  Mr. Hooper.  That's the USS Indianapolis.  That's fine.  Go ahead.  You were only in Indianapolis?  What happened?  Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, chief.  It was coming back from the island of Tinian, the lady.  And just delivered the bomb. 
[00:15:00]  The Hiroshima bomb.  1100 men went into the water.  The vessel went down in 12 minutes.  Didn't see the first shark for about half an hour, tiger.  13-footer.  13-footer.  You know?  You know that when you're in the water, chief?  You tell by looking from the dorsal to the tail. 
[00:15:30]  Well, we didn't know.  Because our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress single had been sent.  Huh?  Huh?  They didn't even list us overdue for a week.  Very light, chief.  The sharks came cruising.  So we formed ourselves into tight groups. 
[00:16:00]  You know, it's kind of like old swears.  A battle, like a, you see, a calendar.  Like the Battle of Waterloo.  And the idea was the shark, the nearest man.  And then he'd start pounding and hollering and screaming.  And sometimes the shark would go away.  Sometimes he wouldn't go away. 
[00:16:30]  Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you.  Right into your eyes.  You know the thing about a shark?  Oh, my God.  He's got lifeless eyes.  Black eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.

Smart Mouth gets at the cause of bad breath without the burn.  And you get clean breath for about 12 hours.  Other mouthwashes only prevent bad breath for about an hour.  Gum and mints, well, they just cover it up.  Use Smart Mouth in the morning for great breath all day.  Rinse in the evening for clean, kissable breath all night.  You can even wake up without morning breath.  Smart Mouth, for 12 hours of real clean breath, look for the green box at your favorite store. 
[00:21:30]  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM.  We got a retard as a front man for a band.  Oh, right.  We never got to this.  We were supposed to get to this on Friday, but we had so much fun with Sandy Kane, we never got to it.  Yes.  I said that last time.  A retard as a front man for a band.  Yes, hello.  It's a foundry.  What do you got, Danny?  No means yes.  I'm just going to bring up this band's MySpace for you guys.  Oh, okay, cool. 
[00:22:00]  What do you know about this guy?  Well, it's a legitimate band.  I mean, it's a disabled gentleman and his brother.  The brother plays music, and he claims he's not exploiting his brother because the brother has a good time,  and he's on stage, and he's performing, and he likes it.  Of course he does.  He's so exploiting his own brother.  I'm sure he likes his fucking dingle lick, too.  Yeah, no kidding.  He likes exploiting him.  Yeah.  And what, this was a documentary or something somewhere?  No, no, this was, I think, a local Philly station got on board very late last week. 
[00:22:30]  So the Philly station also exploiting the retard.  Sure.  And I bet you they, do they play it up like it's so special?  It's so nice and all.  Nice.  Steve has already weighed in saying it's fake, so it must be real.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the singer.  And the drum is down.  Oh, my God.  As soon as she started down that road, I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:23:00]  Holy shit.  Wow.  Oh, God.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking.  And the family photograph is spoiled.  Let's see.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the...  And the hair is Pete Rose's.  Damn it.  Oh, what did you have? 
[00:23:30]  And the Pete Rose wig is missing.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Pete Rose.  You didn't tell me you knew Pete Rose.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and...  And the tongue is fat.  Oh, shit.  All right.  People are guessing, well, Kevin from Connecticut, is the band called System of a Downscape?  Let's try this again, all right? 
[00:24:00]  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the...  The metal is not really a representation of athletic ability.  Oh.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the...  And the cock is monstrous.  Okay.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and... 
[00:24:30]  And the new baby brother is smothered in the crib.  Fuck, David.  Jesus.  They do that sometimes.  I understand.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, okay.  All right, let's get through this, okay?  All right.  Got a few clips.  It's a band with a...  Well, it says right here, a retard is front man for a band.  Okay.  I'm sure that's how the news had the graphic, too.  So...  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking... 
[00:25:00]  And the stomach is stapled.  No, the band's not called Dexie's Midnight Dummies.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the singer is like no one you've ever seen lead a band.  Oh, my God. 
[00:25:30]  Throw your hands in the air and wave them like you don't know where you are.  The band is called Bill.  Bill.  Because that's his name.  And more than that, it's the only word Bill can clearly write.  Throw your hands in the air and wave them like there's a fire and you don't know what to do.  Holy shit.  He looks like Stephen King. 
[00:26:00]  Like an angry Stephen King.  Oh, he really does.  Big retard head.  How appropriate.  It.  And when he showed up, his parents had misery.  Oh, shit.  Kevin from Connecticut is on fire today.  He writes, their number one hit is called...  He kind of just punched his keyboard for the name of the song.  All right. 
[00:26:30]  You're back on the charts with Rolled Over on My Puppy.  It's not a rap band.  Dave.  Dave in Massachusetts.  Is the band's name LL Jewel J?  I want to be...  It's kind of funny, though.  I want to be...  I want to be...  I want to be...  I want to be...  I put...  I put...  He holds the mic out and they all go, my finger in the socket. 
[00:27:00]  For an encore, he just eats pennies.  Old Copper Stomach.  Oh, wow.  From their debut album, Lead Paint Chips are Yummy.  Brian in St. Louis, it's a Led Zeppelin cover band called Lead Eatin'.  Oh, God. 
[00:27:30]  Well, you want to try to get through this clip?  All right.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill.  And you are...  Stupid!  Holy shit!  Tim H. from Columbus, Ohio.  Does that retard realize that isn't a guitar he's holding? 
[00:28:00]  It's a dead squirrel.  Or it's not plugged in.  They just let him flub with it.  Yeah, moron, enjoy it.  The name of their album is called American Idiot.  All right, come on.  Let's see what...  Let me go all the way back, because...  There's something there.  There's something there.  There's a number of members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are... 
[00:28:30]  A disappointment!  All right, we shouldn't do that.  That's right.  Let's just play the clip.  Yeah?  All right.  Let me back it up a little bit here.  Hold on a minute.  Okay.  All right.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are...  Not Pete Rose. 
[00:29:00]  Let's hear the real clip.  This is just not Rose.  Yeah, it's silly.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are...  A problem Doc Martin should have solved. 
[00:29:30]  John in Virginia writes, instead of lighters, everyone holds up hangers.  Come on, let's get to the clip.  That's just not right.  Yeah, we've got to get through it, I guess, huh?  Ah, Dan in New York City, the Eagles are smarter than me.  All right, let's play this clip.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are...  Now detectable through a sonogram. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, my God, Eric Shaw writes, and you are...  Not on the album cover.  All right, let's play this, please.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are... 
[00:30:30]  Typical fodder for this predictable radio show.  Oh, fuck.  Denny from Philly writes, their mom wanted to change the name of the band to Kill Bill.  Holy shit.  All right, you want to hear the clip?  Yes, I'm on the part.  You guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are... 
[00:31:00]  Bill.  You're Bill!  I am.  Bill, you're a singer.  The band Bill named after Bill Gates, not just because that's his first name, but because  it's one of the few words he can write clearly, and that certainly comes in handy when he's  signing up.  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill,  Bill, they just play the music and he sings like, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, 
[00:31:30]  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, it's my new song, I just wrote  it.  Bill's a fucking lunkhead.  They hold up their lighters for Freebird, and he screams and hides behind the amplifiers.  Bill lunkhead.  Yeah, he sees the lighters and thinks the pitchforks are coming next.  Stupid Bill.  Oh, Bill's a lunkhead.  Bill really is.  Gotta set up one more here.  What a bull. 
[00:32:00]  Fucking lunkhead.  Hey, we're doing it.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are...  I like to make werewolf movies.  Uh, see, they're fucking...  They're switched.  It should've been this one.  I am the werewolf!  Yeah, we gotta redo that.  Just wreck the whole bit.  Give me a pen.  All right, we'll go to track two.  Have a pen, seriously.  It's labeled the wrong one.  Uh, no.  It just wrecked the bit.  Oh. 
[00:32:30]  No.  Oh, you want me to go back there?  Uh, I was just like...  I was just looking for something.  You don't have it?  I don't think it's there.  Here, just switch those two.  Those two are wrong.  Just white it out.  All right, you want the next track here?  Band plays clubs and has put out some CDs.  Let's find out about this.  Oh, my God.  I am a singer, yeah.  You are a singer.  Did you always love to sing? 
[00:33:00]  I am a singer.  Bill has Down Syndrome.  Really?  Yeah, audience.  Does he?  Jesus fucking Christ, you idiot.  Boy, aren't you the sharp one.  Oh, my God.  He does.  No, really?  Look at that picture of him.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Let me see that picture.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He looks like a trout.  What?  With glasses.  Why do you need glasses, really?  Hey, Doc Ock is fucking singing in a band. 
[00:33:30]  Fucking Bill has that one.  What else are you going to tell him?  Bill is not a math professor.  Really?  We thought he was on a six-month bender.  Holy shit.  Of course he has Downs, you idiot.  Maybe Bill is a math professor.  One handful of pennies plus one mouth equals stomach aching.  By the way, they're just doing a South Park bit.  This is Timmy.  Yeah.  They're just doing South Park.  Bill's a fool. 
[00:34:00]  Okay.  Bill?  Bill is the quintessential Claude.  Claude.  Holy shit.  And he has glasses, too.  Jesus Christ.  The head doesn't work, and neither do the eyes.  Did God give this kid anything?  Probably has orthopedic shoes.  Fucking a little dick.  A little dick.  Yeah.  We get it, God.  You don't like Bill.  Oh, fuck.  He fucked Bill over. 
[00:34:30]  Jesus Christ.  God didn't even give him lips.  Who are Bill's parents?  Is he in a cape?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's in a cape.  Oh, my God.  He's probably in a fine restaurant.  Stupid man.  He put the tablecloth on.  Trying to fly through Tavern in the Green.  Excuse me.  You're going to have to put your thing back in the chair.  Bill has Down syndrome.  The audience doesn't really seem to know quite what to make of it all.  Big Brother John has always been in bed.  Spider brain. 
[00:35:00]  He's got a little cape.  He's a superhero.  Oh.  Spider brain.  Spider brain.  Spider brain.  Look.  Thinks whatever.  Spider cane.  Look.  Able to debate with a rock or tree stump.  It's stupid man. 
[00:35:30]  Spider man.  Spider man.  Does whatever the spider man.  Yes, Bill.  Spins a web.  Anytime.  All right.  Here we go.  Big Brother John has always been in bands.  Music was always around the house.  And that love for music rubbed off on Bill at an early age.  We'd always hear crazy stuff coming out of it.  Holy shit.  That picture makes him look like Tom Likus.  Oh, my God.  Tom Likus is the lead singer.  Tom Likus is the mongoloid.  He's the lead singer of Bill.  They put masks on the other members of the band. 
[00:36:00]  Of course they do.  But no mask required for Bill.  He's got his own built-in mask.  Yes.  God-given mask.  He's actually wearing one.  He's the lead character from Dumbbell.  It's just the costume box just said quad on it.  I love that word.  Oh, he really is a buffoon.  Fucking blithering idiot.  A numbskull. 
[00:36:30]  A tremendous numbskull.  Oh, fuck.  He'd always hear crazy stuff coming out of his room.  He'd be putting on little skits and playing records and singing along.  The band plays out at clubs all over New England.  Now they're on YouTube, MySpace.  They've released a couple of CDs.  After a show, when we get back in the car, he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking.  Shut up.  Nothing.  Nothing worse than a babbling pee break. 
[00:37:00]  Here we go.  First thing he usually says.  There it comes.  Hold on.  Back up.  First thing he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking.  And the first thing he usually says is...  Anyone need a spare chromosome?  Get back in the car.  The first thing he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking.  And the first thing he usually says is...  Did mom drink during pregnancy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, wow.  Get back in the car.  The first thing he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking.  And the first thing he usually says is...  I want to do that again.  Why is that funny?  Really?  The first thing he says after he shits his pants, too.  Or eats a donut.  Fucking kicks a small animal. 
[00:38:00]  Rapes the neighbor.  I want to do that again.  I want to do that again.  But there's no doubt for people with children who have Down syndrome, Bill is a total inspiration.  And they just think it's awesome.  His dream was to join a band and be a rockhead. 
[00:38:30]  That's been really wonderful.  That has been...  That's actually probably been my favorite response of all.  They just say this really just gives me hope that...  That we, too, can get our thing out of the house.  When my son grows up, when my daughter grows up, that she might...  You know, if she has something that she really loves to do, that she might have the chance to actually do it, too.  Uh-huh.  You know, in a big way.  I do know why you get my thing. 
[00:39:00]  There's no pretension at all.  He just connects directly with the audience.  He's right with them.  Yeah.  And they...  Spitting on them.  What, are they all on heroin or something?  Jeez.  What the fuck?  Oh, I don't mean to be so harsh.  We're just kidding.  You know what, though?  We're absolutely exploiting the little fella.  But the news is acting like this is a real good thing.  Stop.  They're exploiting the hell out of the guy.  And they really sense that.  They really get it.  You know, he grabs...  His head is a drum. 
[00:39:30]  He doesn't want to let go.  Beat him up the head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Bill.  You're my new favorite.  Oh, shut up.  He's not.  He is not.  Lucy in the sky with Tommy.  He's not going to fucking...  Yeah, she's not going to listen to his CDs.  Right.  You're my new favorite.  Really?  Really.  You're going to fucking fill your iPod with his fucking...  Droning? 
[00:40:00]  Droning banality?  She's going to have an iPod filled with Coldplay and Bill.  Sure.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Bill.  You're my new favorite.  Thank you.  That was awesome.  Awesome.  Good job.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You were great.  That was awesome.  As he just grabs her tit like a chimp.  He doesn't know it's wrong.  Oh, he's got a fucking cowboy hat on like Lemmy and big glasses. 
[00:40:30]  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  He's a rock star, Jimmy.  Come on.  Yeah.  Look at him go.  Look at him walking down the stairs very careful.  Yeah.  Well, you want to hear My Heart and All My Life by a fan Bill?  More than I want to breathe.  I want to hear that.  Here we go.  Some Bill.  Here is Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  That sound should have been the abortion machine.  I hear some gentle scraping on a womb wall. 
[00:41:00]  I hear the mother going, make sure you get it all.  I don't want one scrap of dummy left.  Now it's just awful.  Now it's just horrible.  Oh, fuck.  This is going to be right.  This is so not fucking right.  Oh, my God. 
[00:41:30]  We got a GWAR reference today.  Holy shit.  Mike in Jersey.  What's up?  Yo, man.  What's up, fellas?  Yo, this dude could be on GWAR and not wear a costume, man.  Very nice.  That's all I got.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tony in New York.  Tony.  Hey, morning, guys.  Morning.  He's a real rock star.  His tour bus is a short bus.  He's hooked on Ritalin and Jelly Beans, and his groupies consist of stuffed animals and  girls who wear hockey helmets at a normal amount of time. 
[00:42:00]  Bravo.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Here we go.  Bill.  Bill.  That's not very good.  I love it.  Don't sign my life.  Like my name. 
[00:42:30]  American I-dolt.  That would scare him if he heard that.  Oh.  What the hell is he singing about? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, Lord.  Yes, you stupid.  What's that?  What's that?  What is he there? 
[00:43:30]  What is he there?  That is...  That is awful.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Stop it! Stop it!  Quiet. Stop whining. 
[00:44:30]  This sucks.  This sucks.  Wow.  That was really bad.  I had higher hopes for him. 
[00:45:00]  There you go. Wonderful.  We're gonna take our first break.  God, do we pound those into the ground, don't we?  How can you not, though?  It's such an easy target.

You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show, Sirius XM. 
[00:49:30]  I haven't been playing video games in the past couple of days.  Why, Anthony?  Because I kind of got roped in.  You hear all our comic friends, Opie.  All our comic friends come on this program, and what do they plug nowadays?  Remember when everyone used to plug their gigs and their personal websites?  Yeah, Jimmy Norton would eat a bullet, and then they'd plug their gigs and everything. 
[00:50:00]  Now, Opie, they come on and go, oh, got to go to my MySpace site.  MySpace.  MySpace.  Everyone's with MySpace.  So, Bill Burr, you know, you go to MySpace slash Bill Burr, and you get to Bill Burr's MySpace.  I wasn't too hip on MySpace.  Didn't know what the fuck it was.  I was playing a lot of games.  Until I go on Wackbag, and I read, Anthony has a MySpace account. 
[00:50:30]  Ooh.  And I'm like, ooh, I do?  So, I go to it, and it's some guy using my screen name.  So, it's not my name.  It's not Anthony Cumia.  And he's got the picture of me with my rapier looking completely ridiculous, which, you know, that's what the picture's for.  And his bio is kind of similar to something I would write, except in the heroes section.  You had Adolf Hitler and things like that. 
[00:51:00]  And, you know, I wouldn't put that in public.  Not like that.  And so, I decided, okay, I got to now make a MySpace with my name so that someone can steal it.  You know, and put stuff on there that isn't me.  So, I did that.  A little simple thing.  It's very easy to do.  Boom.  I had a MySpace account.  And I start looking at other people's MySpace accounts.  And notice, they have friends. 
[00:51:30]  They have graphics, pictures.  Mine just looked like it had my name and a picture.  And a brief bio where, you know, I wrote down a couple of things.  It was pretty much saying, this is Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  Anyone else that says they're Anthony is full of shit.  I made this MySpace so no one can steal my name.  So, I'm looking around going, all right, well, how do you do that?  I want to do that.  And it's a lot of, it's the most user unfriendly thing you can ever get involved with. 
[00:52:00]  Because it's all, remember, HTML programming?  Oh, boy, do I.  Back in the ye olden days?  It's all code.  So, you have to know code, either cut and paste from someone else, alter a few things  in order to insert in pictures and links and stuff.  So, I just spent, like, the past couple of days popping links on.  I got links to my brother's 2U site and things like that.  Of course, XM, our Opie and Anthony thing.  MySpace, Jim Norton.  Jim Norton is one of my pals. 
[00:52:30]  Now, here's another thing.  Your friend list.  Here's now where the pressure's on.  You start going, he has more friends than me.  Jimmy Norton is up to, how many friends do you have?  Not as many as I'd like.  I have, like, 2,300, which I need a lot more.  2,300 friends.  Do you accept everybody?  Um, yes.  You accept all of your friends? 
[00:53:00]  Yes, that's the real Jim Norton.  How do you not accept somebody?  Like, they have to convince you?  You can deny.  Deny.  Deny!  What if I want to be one of Jim Norton's friends on MySpace?  Good luck.  It would come up that Opie wants to be your friend.  By the way, there's a guy named Opie.  Yeah, he's holding it.  And he said he's holding the spot for you.  Yeah, thank you.  If you ever want to do that.  Jim Norton was taken and the guy, I wrote him something, was very cool, let me have it.  I love it.  Very nice.  Very cool. 
[00:53:30]  So Jimmy, of course, in big bold letters, just has his upcoming gigs.  Right.  And then...  Just to go back really fast, so I want to be a friend.  Do I have to, like, explain why I want to be a friend?  No.  So then that person decides if they accept you or not?  No.  No explanation.  So it's just like, hey, I'm Joe Schmo from Albany.  Friend request.  Friend request comes on, but...  You should have to, like, try to, you know...  Here's what you do.  Explain yourself a little bit.  You click on the link next to it before you accept, and then you look at his MySpace.  Now you see, because I've denied a couple of people that obviously were brand new, just 
[00:54:00]  wanted to be my friend.  They had no other friends.  Brand new account, no bio, no nothing, not even a friend.  And I made a rule.  I am not going to be someone's first friend.  Good boy.  I'm not going to be, when you scroll down to friends, one picture of me standing there  as this guy's friend.  You know what?  I'm going to start my MySpace account today.  Are you doing it?  And I'm going to deny every single person except two.  You want two friends? 
[00:54:30]  Just two.  And who are they going to be?  All day, I'm going to just be, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Yes.  That's not in the spirit of MySpace.  I'm going to have two friends.  That's it.  And MySpace, by the way...  And it's not you, and it's not you.  Taking off, there are so many fucking people now on MySpace, it's ridiculous.  Like, everyone has a MySpace site.  Jimmy Norton has 2,327 friends right now. 
[00:55:00]  That's very impressive, Jimmy.  Now, here's the tricky part.  You can only display what they call your top eight.  Out of all your friends, you have to pick eight of your friends that are displayed on your page.  The rest, you have to hit view all Jim Norton's friends link.  And then scroll through hundreds of pages.  So where's the pressure?  You're still a friend.  No, the pressure is who do you make your top eight now?  Top eight friends.  Top eight.  Voss yelled at me. 
[00:55:30]  I got an email from Voss going,  Why aren't I on your top eight?  And I had to put him...  Then I had to throw someone off who got pissed at me for...  I was in the top eight, why'd you throw me off?  The pressure.  So Jimmy, Jimmy's solution is to have Ozzy as one of his friends.  Yup.  But he's not your friend.  He is my friend.  Just look at the MySpace and you tell me.  He's not your friend.  He is.  Have you ever done anything with him as friends?  I've interviewed him.  We sat and talked. 
[00:56:00]  Anthony and I interviewed him.  I sat and talked with Ozzy.  You barely talked to him.  We took a couple of pictures.  You were shitting in your shoes that day.  You didn't interview Ozzy.  I asked him to sign something.  Let's be honest here.  You were a scaredy cat.  You were petrified.  You asked a couple of cute questions at the end.  He's my friend.  We did the heavy lifting that day.  Ozzy should be our friend.  No, Ozzy is my friend.  You haven't done shit with Ozzy.  Ozzy is, according to MySpace, Ozzy is Jimmy's friend.  One of my eight friends.  Along with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss. 
[00:56:30]  Where did you hang out with Ace Frehley?  He didn't hang out yet, but he means to.  The thing about MySpace, Opie, you don't have to meet anybody.  You have to prove that you've done some friend thing.  No, not with MySpace.  I hate MySpace.  They are just MySpace friends.  I have over 450 friends now.  I don't know any of them.  You don't even have a friend in real life.  In real life, I have no friends.  Anthony doesn't have a friend in real life, but now he's this social animal online.  I have friends, friends, friends. 
[00:57:00]  Ace Frehley, Peter Criss.  Boy, they're going to be disappointed.  Yes.  And Ozzy.  Yes.  Those are three.  And now the rest of Jimmy's friends, the top eight, all trannies.  He has picked trannies as his top eight.  Top five.  They will be the top eight sooner or later.  I have to work them in.  They're all just going to be trannies.  And then Jimmy's got things, because you can give general information about your interests,  musical tastes, which he has music. 
[00:57:30]  The Robert Reed robe pocket full of tissues commemorative Christmas album.  And anything by Marvin Gaye after 1984.  Holy crap, dude.  Jesus.  Some of Jim's favorite movies.  The mystery of Jane Mansfield and the Empty Hat.  It's one of my favorites.  You are something. 
[00:58:00]  And the Who...  Let's see.  DVDs.  The Who Shit in My Socks installment of the Sherlock Holmes series.  Jimmy is a card when it comes to...  Hold on, Anthony.  To MySpace.  I found one of your friends.  Anthony and Glen Cove.  In Glen Cove.  What's up, Anthony? 
[00:58:30]  What's up, guys?  What are you doing?  Hey.  You're friends with Anthony on MySpace?  Yeah, he's got the greatest page on MySpace, by the way.  He's got a great Half-Life 2 background.  I did do a lot of work.  What?  The photos he has up there are the best, with his shotgun and his submachine gun.  I'd laugh my ass off all day looking at them.  And there's also some of them at the shooting range.  But why did Anthony accept you as a friend?  Because I was drunk, Elo, at the Christmas party, and he saw my photos on MySpace,  and then he realized I was a fan of the show, and he put me on there. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  See, that's a reason to be a friend.  That's great.  Here is my MySpace site.  Wow, that's pretty impressive, actually.  I've been working very diligently on it.  You can see my pictures.  I'm holding my shotgun and my AR-15, which really makes me look insane.  I have plugs to, I have links to the opiananthony.com, XM satellite radio prominently displayed on it. 
[00:59:30]  Figured I'd do a little plugging.  And then my friends, my top eight right now, this is how desperate I am.  Links to Radio's Anthony, 2U, my Uncle Joe's guitar site, where he builds guitars, and then my pals.  First, foremost, Jimmy Norton.  Ooh!  Coming in second in my top eight, Rich Voss for whining so much that he wasn't in my friends list. 
[01:00:00]  Number three, Robert Kelly, my good friend Bob Kelly.  Joe Rogan is number four.  Number five, actually, Pat from Munaki is in my top eight.  He will soon get kicked out as soon as Bill Burr or any other famous comedian.  Anybody with a family.  Anybody with a family that they can go to Christmas with.  Keith the Cop, good friend.  Our own Than is in my top eight.  Nathaniel has a MySpace account. 
[01:00:30]  And if we click on Than's site, you'll see him sitting there reading a book in his picture from the set of a movie.  Did you know he was doing a film at this time?  No, I did not.  Yes, we didn't until I went to his MySpace.  What film is he doing?  What film is he?  Where is Than?  Get him in here.  What independent is this?  Nathaniel, I read all about your short film that you made.  Thank you.  And it sounded very funny. 
[01:01:00]  It has potential.  We shot it last month over a weekend, and I'm not sure when they're going to be done with it.  Thanks.  He's reading the Kirk Douglas book sitting on a couch in his picture.  Very important, your MySpace picture.  Yeah.  Because that really is your first impression with MySpace.  If someone wants to be your friend, the first thing you do is look at the picture.  I am at a lack of whores is what I'm saying.  Jimmy's whores galore. 
[01:01:30]  I've been through your friend stack.  Man, there are just sluts and whores and half-naked women.  I have in my MySpace, I swear to you, one hot chick out of the 400 and some odd people I now have as friends, one hot chick.  By the way, I get it.  You don't like me.  Why?  I didn't make it.  What happened?  You don't have a MySpace account.  You don't have an account.  Ozzy didn't have a MySpace account. 
[01:02:00]  Yes, he does.  He does.  Oh, he does?  Yeah.  That's how he's my friend.  You have to be.  He's like, I'm like, you silly goose.  So there's still a chance that Anthony likes me?  Yes.  Of course.  If you got, you would be in my top eight.  Would I be number one?  Number one.  Let me think.  Who's number one?  Jimmy?  You'd have to be.  Yeah.  You would have to be number one.  I don't want to have to be.  Because it's the Opie and Anthony show.  But I don't want to have to be.  I want to be.  I'd accept.  You would be.  I don't mind being nudged out.  I don't want to. 
[01:02:30]  Jimmy would have to then go to number two.  Jimmy doesn't mind.  There's a have to.  I want to be.  You know something?  I don't want no hierarchy crap.  I just want to be.  Would I be number one in your top eight?  Absolutely not.  Then I would have to correspond.  There would be a war going on as to where your position is.  I would have to look.  By the way, the first person that is getting dropped from this is Pat from Unaki.  This is not fun, by the way. 
[01:03:00]  It is very, the pressure.  Now I understand the pressure.  A lot of pressure.  Because I was sitting there all wanting and hoping and I didn't make the top eight.  Why do you guys put pressure on yourselves?  Just do what I do and put fucking rock stars and hot chicks.  And Trent, what about real friends, my friend?  My real friends know who they are, I think.  And by the way, I emailed, I clicked on Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  Yeah.  And requested that I be his friend.  He has not gotten back to me and has not clicked to acknowledge me as a friend. 
[01:03:30]  That a boy, Bill.  And I am very upset with that.  Bill really thinks who the fuck he is now.  Bill, by the way, goes through every single one and looks through their profile.  I think he does background checks on people before he makes them their friend.  I told you there's tension there.  I need more friends and so do Opie and Anthony.  We all need friends.  Please spread the word.  Look at all the new friend requests that are coming in right now from me.  I can't get to my computer, Ant.  I'd like some friends. 
[01:04:00]  I just have, right now, I have 14 pages of people requesting to be my friend.  Ha ha.  He's going to have more friends than Jimmy.  No, guys.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  I'd like some more friends, please.  Myspace slash Jim Norton.  Oh, guys.  Let's look at this girl, finally.  Okay, we have a girl that wants to be my friend.  Her name is Amy.  Okay.  She is third down on the list.  I thought you were going to say she's in third grade.  Jesus.  Let's look at her.  Yeah.  All right, this girl looks, oh, that's her cute little sister. 
[01:04:30]  Ooh.  That's me and her sister.  Her sister's kind of got a goth look to her, but she seems fine.  I will accept her as a friend.  There we go.  I'm making friends, Opie, on the computer.  The place where I like keeping friends because I don't have to touch them.  Ha ha.  Let's go to Joe in O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, guys.  What's up, Joe?  Nothing. 
[01:05:00]  I wanted to have Anthony at me as a friend.  I just sent them a request.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I'm Joe El Gigante.  I'm Joe the Giant.  Joe the Giant?  How big are you?  It's in Spanish, though.  How big are you?  6'4".  Hey, look, you lumbering ass.  Why don't you send me a friend request?  Dude, I'm already your friend, man.  Oh, go fuck yourself.  Oh, look at this girl.  Danielle.  She wants to be my friend now.  Ooh.  Very nice.  See?  Can I see the picture at least?  Maybe I can help you with this process. 
[01:05:30]  Look, there are pictures of Danielle.  Oh, she's very hot.  See?  She'll be your friend.  She will be my friend.  All my friends now look like it's all a bunch of guys with beer guts that I see hanging  out with ONA shirts and hats on.  So it's nice to get a little diversity in my friend portfolio.  Oh, I'm going to have to sort through a lot of people.  And there are some gay gentlemen that I will deny right here. 
[01:06:00]  But you're not touching the gay gentlemen.  You just said you're not touching these people.  You don't want them popping up in your friend party.  Yeah.  Mingling around.  You never know what attachment you might open.  All right.  And names, you know, you get some names like Cute Lil Puggle wants to be your friend.  Connor I've made my friend.  Scott Peterson's a friend.  Little Connor.  Scott Peterson definitely wants to be my friend.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you got to, you're not a real person, Opie, these days, unless you have a MySpace account. 
[01:06:30]  That does seem to be what's going on in this day and age on the computer.  I need more friends.  Hmm.  MySpace.  You have 2,000, over 2,000 friends.  I'd like more.  I send personal notes to every friend.  You do not.  I do.  I write a handwritten letter.  You send plugs.  If you're appearing at, please show up.  I don't.  I don't send plugs at all because I'm ready to get it.  No, you print it in the largest text size possible in red.  Well, in MySpace world, we call it font, punk.  Font.  Jim's all about more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more. 
[01:07:00]  It never ends with you.  Opie, I want more friends.  More, more, more, more.  Never happy, never happy.  More, more, more, more, more, more.  I have not.  You haven't hooked up on that?  I have not.  That's not what it's for.  However, ladies, I'm always willing to correspond and be a friend.  I want a girlfriend.  I don't want to just get laid anymore.  I want a nice girl.  Yeah, that worked out good yesterday.  Yeah.  Kirby in Oklahoma.  All right.  Hey, MySpace is fucking hearted.  I understand the format of the show, and I know you guys just talk about whatever, but 
[01:07:30]  you guys can come up with something a little bit more serious than the East scene  and making internet friends, because MySpace is for emo fags and lonely people.  No one else.  What is your MySpace name, sir?  I don't have one.  Why?  It's fucking hearted.  You sound like a lonely person who breathes heavily.  Then how do you know it's retarded, sir?  We talk about it all the time, and the people who plug it, and you go check any random account,  any girls, they're like, oh, check out my picture, and they use stupid fucking things 
[01:08:00]  like, oh, thanks for that.  Hey, listen, I've got to be honest.  I don't see the point of MySpace.  It makes friends open.  It's a popularity contest to make you feel good about yourself.  Absolutely.  People like to see how many friends you're up to.  It's stupid.  You know what it is, really?  I think it's a good example.  It shows how easy AIDS could be spread.  Because you have you, and then you make a couple of friends, and then you look at them,  and they've got a bunch of friends who have a bunch of friends, and you realize if you 
[01:08:30]  had sex with that person, and they had sex with those people, it's all over.  It's all over.  Next thing you know, you're all on Fire Island walking a friend's dog.  Let's go to Johnny-O in East Iceland.  Johnny-O.  What's going on, gentlemen?  Wasn't it already done?  Hey there, Judy.  Wasn't it already done?  Wasn't it already done on Seinfeld?  Who's number one on speed dial?  Who's number one on speed dial?  Well, the speed dial, yeah.  Because it's similar, sure.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  I never really watched Seinfeld, but I'm sure it was.  Who-hoo.  Who-hoo.  Who-hoo, indeed. 
[01:09:00]  Who-hoo.  All right, thank you.  Why don't we take a break?  From now on, my name, by the way, is not Jim Norton.  It's Anthony's best friend.  Oh.  Fuck.  You are number one.  Fuck.  I'm number one.  Fuck.  Yes, I am.  Oh, you just got my pictures up there?  Ooh.  You see me from the poker tournament?  There you are.  And I have pictures with me and my guns.  I'm number one.  I'm number one.  But right next to it, it says, I'm a people person.  Yeah, you sure are. 
[01:09:30]  Do you realize, without me, this would read, Anthony has 447 friends.  Yes.  Exactly.  And it wouldn't be the same.  It wouldn't.  All right, we should break, right?  Let us break so Opie can get himself an account.  I'm not getting an account.  You're going to be number two.  You are going to get yourself an account.  I will not get a MySpace account.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm Anthony's best friend.  Go fuck yourself.  Now, enough of this palaver.  Let's get back to MySpace. 
[01:10:00]  Steve just actually threw his arms up in the air when you said that.  Yeah.  He goes, I have more material.  Let's go to Westchester.  KC, what do you have for the show?  What's up, guys?  You know, there's a shitload of fucking groups on that thing that are just twisted.  They have groups Jimmy would like for like water sports and freak shows like that and everything.  Yeah.  They have groups for like people like shooting people and everything like that.  It's called Anthony Cumia. 
[01:10:30]  They got a bunch of Opie and Anthony groups and all.  Yeah.  The site is so friggin' addictive it's not even funny.  Why is it?  I don't get why it's addicting.  That's because you have a ten that you enjoy spending time with.  For those of us that don't, we like to go out and meet people.  It's just a, it's a form of technology and you start working on it and it becomes some  kind of a thing you do.  But you're building a list of fake friends and then what?  They're real.  Then what happens?  Then what happens? 
[01:11:00]  Then you put links to important things that are important to you.  Like for me, it's show related stuff.  And then what happens?  They go to those links and it kind of does help out the show a bit.  And then what happens?  You meet all of them.  Nothing.  I don't need an end game here.  Then they send you gold doubloons, Opie.  Is that what you want to hear?  It's...  You meet them.  That sounds stupid.  Advertising.  I send a handwritten note to every friend I have.  It says, thanks for being my friend.  I pen it with a...  You do, not a quill. 
[01:11:30]  I quill.  You quill it?  Dip and I quill it.  How many people in that room have a MySpace account?  Alright.  One, two, three, four.  Andy Gore.  Andy Gore, of course.  Bill Burr's on the line.  Mr. Burr?  Yes.  Bill?  Hello.  Hey, Bill.  How you doing?  We're good.  Hey.  Is that Anthony saying hey?  Yes.  How you doing, man?  I heard you were talking shit about me, man.  What's your problem?  I sent in a request to be your friend on MySpace and I never got anything back. 
[01:12:00]  A confirmation.  You know why that is?  Why?  Our relationship has hit a snag until you come clean about your relationship with that fucking  whore bitch chef of yours.  I don't have a relationship with my wonderful chef.  Anthony.  Look at you.  You're emaciated.  That bitch is not feeding you. 
[01:12:30]  There's only one thing that you could be doing with her.  You're fucking her, Anthony.  I am a perfect way...  No, I am not.  Give me a request and just say, okay, Bill, I'm fucking that poor bitch chef and I'll accept  you as a friend.  I would never.  Then we will have...  Until there is honesty in this relationship, you just can't go any further.  Then we will have to remain not MySpace friends, my friend.  Fine.  I'm happy to be a co-worker with you.  I won't even look at you. 
[01:13:00]  And now that's as far as it's going to go.  Because I am not banging my chef.  She is a wonderful cook, a wonderful woman.  No, she isn't.  But I am in a relationship, a very happy relationship.  I am very much in love, my friend.  Anthony.  And his name is Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  BFFL, pal.  Anthony, you're 82 years old.  You have 0% body fat.  She's not feeding you.  I am the perfect weight for my height. 
[01:13:30]  All right, Bill.  Jim's a friend of mine on MySpace.  Yes, we are.  I saw that.  Jim's an honest man.  What did he have to fess up to?  God only knows.  What a nightmare of horror he had to fess up to.  I don't know.  You see my top eight?  Yeah.  All right, Bill.  All right, man.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye, sweetie.  Later, man.  Bye.  Bye.  The link to Anthony's MySpace account is now on opianthony.com. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wait, I'd like a link, guys.  You've had one, too.  Thank you.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy has one, too?  Yeah, we're friends.  We don't compete.  No, we don't.  We'll see what the total is tomorrow, okay?  No, we don't.  Why don't we just combine our friends?  We should.  Anthony Norton or Jim Cormia, however you slice them.

I couldn't go to sleep last night either. 
[01:19:00]  I was watching this haunted, this fucked up shit about Bobby Mackey's place in Kentucky.  Have you heard about this?  I can't watch that haunted house shit before bed.  This guy got scratched.  Scratched.  Like, you know, the guys like, my back hurts.  They picked up his shirt and there was just three scratch marks on his back.  He got scratched by a demon.  Probably a fucking spring coming through the bed when he was sleeping.  There's no bed.  They're in a basement.  Where was he sleeping?  Dude, this Bob Mackey place is one of the hauntedest places in the...  One of the hauntedest. 
[01:19:30]  Who's Bob Mackey?  Not most haunted, just hauntedest.  Hauntedest, this, this.  Bobby, who's Bob Mackey?  Bob Mackey.  Who is he?  Bob Mackey's a country singer from Kentucky, but he bought this place that used to be  a slaughterhouse back in the 1800s.  For what?  Slaughtering cows and shit.  So the cows are haunting him now?  Hang on.  No, no.  Someone's mowing.  The milk is always spilled.  But they wound up closing down and these satanic cults took it over and they actually  decapitated this girl.  There was a big, one of the biggest murder things in Kentucky and they found this girl's 
[01:20:00]  head in a well and all that.  Then, over the years, it was taken over by casinos, illegal gambling, prohibition.  Casino business.  A lot of people, murders there, a lot of deaths, a lot of people, some girl killed her father  and then committed suicide in the basement.  Nice place.  It actually has a sign in the front.  It's a country western bar, okay?  And it has a sign in the front that says, if you are attacked by any paranormal activity,  we are not responsible.  Well, they say that to get you in. 
[01:20:30]  How the hell?  Of course.  It's a selling point.  Yeah.  It actually killed his business.  But you can't sue him?  No, it killed him.  How would that be in court?  Hey, it was a ghost.  Yes.  They killed him.  It's on the internet.  A lady tried to sue.  It's on the internet.  It's got to be true.  They have the document.  The actual court document.  She tried to sue because she was attacked by a ghost.  That's going to be true.  They had this shit on last night.  These guys were in the basement.  But it's not those ghost shows where they have all the people and the camera guys that talk.  Ghost, we're here to help.  This guy's like this tough guy, muscle guy. 
[01:21:00]  But he screams like a little girl?  No, but he's screaming.  He talks to the ghost.  He's like, come on.  Attack me right now.  Scratch me, you son of a bitch.  He's like taunting the demon.  He's a tough guy with ghosts.  Yeah.  With Chief Brody.  The ghost scratches him and he's like, look, I got to get out of here.  Hold on.  Let me ask most gullible man alive.  So what exactly?  Watch it.  Watch it.  Wait, so the tough guy got scratched?  He got scratched.  How though?  Did they ever explain that?  No.  He's screaming at them.  They have video of him getting scratched with nothing around him to do it? 
[01:21:30]  This is a video they had last night.  They actually, he's sitting there screaming.  What they do, like these other people, they get locked in.  They say padlock us into this haunted place.  We're not getting out until the morning.  So they're stuck in there, no matter what happens.  And it's just three guys.  That's a good concept.  There's just three guys.  What was that show?  Scare Tactics?  Not Scare Tactics.  What was the other one where they kind of did this?  It was on MTV or something.  The Partridge Family?  I forgot the name.  It was hot for like a few weeks.  They would go to old prisons and stuff. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  It sounds like the same show.  They just repackaged it.  Go ahead.  Well, these three guys go in there by themselves.  They lock him in, into Bob Mackie's place, and they lock him in the basement.  Nothing about Bob Mackie.  They actually show, they have the video camera shit up.  They show these shadows walking in the background.  You can see all this crazy shit.  And then this guy's screaming at the demons, attack me, attack me.  It's called the gateway to hell, this well where they found the lady's head, and all the  Satan worshipers used to conduct business. 
[01:22:30]  And then he's like, dude, my back is on fire right now.  And they're like, what's wrong?  And he picked up his shirt, and then you can see these three scratches on his back.  When did they stop the camera so they could scratch the sky?  They did.  Yeah.  Well, if you guys, you know what?  Uh-uh.  Did you look for cuts?  You guys.  Cuts in the action, like, okay, wait, now that could have been a camera.  Okay.  So you're saying, this is absolute proof, so there is life after death.  There is some kind of spirit world.  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:23:00]  So no one has to worry, because when you die, you'll be a spirit.  You could haunt a place and scratch people's backs.  No, no, no, no.  Demons are different than ghosts.  What?  Demons are different than ghosts.  What?  Ghosts are human.  Yeah.  Demons aren't human.  Well, how did he know it was a demon?  Because it scratched them.  Ghosts can't scratch?  The sign of the Trinity, which is three.  Yes.  Wow.  Most colorful.  I don't know about-  But, dude, he's got a legal disclaimer, dude. 
[01:23:30]  It's like it was on the internet.  I said, well, it's on the internet.  It's gotta be true.  No, the document was on the internet.  Oh.  You can't just-  Give me a document.  I'll put it in Photoshop for five minutes and make it look completely different.  This is where Bob made me want to spit in his face.  You can make Star Wars over in your house, you fucking nerd.  Bob said they got the actual court-  You have a green screen, you fucking asshole.  He said they got the actual court documents.  Sorry to interrupt your fucking smash on me.  The actual court documents.  Yeah, like what a-  No, dude, they got the actual documents.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't realize that. 
[01:24:00]  Danny, if you're work yourself, you'll get that document.  Bobby D and Brock did it.  The show was called Fear.  Sounds like the-  No.  No, the old show, Fear.  Yeah, yeah.  Did a lot of the same stuff.  And I was into it for a while.  What'd it be called Bunko?  Dude, let me tell you something.  I'll fucking-  I want to see the clip, because I bet you we could pick it apart-  You can't.  It's on the internet.  You can't.  The camera stopped and they scratched his back.  Yeah.  Do we get to see his back before this happened?  No, of course you don't.  Yeah.  So maybe the scratch were already there.  I didn't know-  I didn't know it was going to be scratched, so why did they show it beforehand?  Yeah, why are you shirtless? 
[01:24:30]  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Listen, I saw this on one of the-  But you understand they can scratch his back and then, all right, time to make believe  that scratch just happened.  I saw-  Lift up your shirt, make believe you're in pain.  Ghosts are real.  I saw-  Roll credits.  I saw-  I saw-  I saw-  I saw-  Go ahead.  I saw-  On one of these ghost things, the guy actually got scratched on camera.  There was a demon attacking this guy.  No, there wasn't.  I swear to God.  I swear to fucking God.  I saw it.  I wasn't.  I swear to God. 
[01:25:00]  That would be on every news channel.  Okay, look.  That would be the biggest story ever.  Oh my God, there are ghosts.  It's real.  I think he did it to himself.  Dude, YouTube real ghosts, they have a little girl sitting in a chair and it's just bouncing off  the ground.  She's having fun.  And all those videos are made up.  How is that made up?  I don't know.  It's a white trash family.  I don't know all the trickery.  The money to buy a huge magnet to stick under their floor?  Maybe.  A magnet?  What kind of cartoons are you watching?  Maybe they just have wires.  No wires.  Have you ever seen a magic show?  It's hard to see the wires. 
[01:25:30]  Special effects.  This show actually brings it to physicists.  Physicists.  Is there any video of that, Danny?  No?  Of course not.  Why wouldn't it be on YouTube?  Why would it be on YouTube?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  What's that?  Why?  Why would it be on YouTube?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  It wouldn't be, here's cute Jesus walking around with holes in his palms. 
[01:26:00]  Let me tell you something.  I went to use my phone.  Okay?  I went to make a phone call.  This is scary.  What happened?  Okay.  I pick up my brand new iPhone.  Modern technology.  G3.  Can I see your iPhone?  I don't know where it is right now.  But I'd never let you touch anything.  What happened?  We're going to go on the phone.  I went to call the number.  And this, now, I just watched this.  Let's all talk softly like Bobby.  I just watched this.  So you got your new iPhone.  I'm captivated.  I'm very, I'm very scared.  My friend's a ghost hunter.  I'm a pussy when it comes to this stuff.  I'm scared.  I feel, you know when you can feel something else in the room? 
[01:26:30]  That's what I felt.  Yes, like douche chills right now.  And I dialed the phone and this is what I heard.  Yeah, man.  Skullsky.  No.  Hang on.  I'm not done.  That's scary.  Don't do that.  You're scaring me.  Somebody was rewinding a tape. 
[01:27:00]  I swear to God, my fucking cell phone did that.  And I was talking to it.  On an iPhone, you had bad reception.  Oh my God.  Yeah, that's all that is.  Every other word.  Every time, every time I would go, what the fuck, I can't, I don't know, I could hear a  voice.  Go to the new, do it.  Just move.  Check recents.  Then breathing.  Check recents and see who made the call.  I made the call.  I made the call.  I made the call.  See where it went to.  I made the call.  What?  Who did you call?  The devil?  The demon?  The demon?  No, I was calling a friend.  Who?  None of your business.  But did that friend, did you talk to that friend and go, I tried to call you and got 
[01:27:30]  a demon?  Or they say, no, I remember your phone came up.  I couldn't hear you.  Sorry, my friend, Dev, had the phone.  He had the head.  Hi, how are you?  Then he realized he was just hearing himself eating.  Just move closer to the window.  Exactly.  Like everyone else.  How many bars did you have?  There's not a ghost in the phone.  It's just bad reception.  There's got to be people out there who had ghost experiences.  Oh, you want to go to the phones? 
[01:28:00]  Ghost experience.  Why don't we start with Bob is such a fucking douchebag.  He must have downloaded an apparition.  Hang on.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  Tom from, you said, Tom and Stony Brook.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  I just want to point out, man, the first show and the first episode, the guy, the main  character, spoke about how tough he is and he's not the head.  He goes halfway through the first night, they jump out of the fire escape from the second  floor to get shitless, and they ran off the show.  Yeah, dude.  This guy, I mean, this show, because that makes good TV. 
[01:28:30]  You're not going to sit there and be like, wow, another haunted house with nothing around.  So, we'll just hand this in to the network and hope for the best.  Wait, what are you guys stupid?  Did you, now when you watched that show, dude, was that some freaky shit or what?  It definitely was.  But, well, when the guy got scratched, Bob's leaving this part out.  When the guy got scratched, he had a shirt on and he got scratched underneath the shirt.  It's not like they just showed his back and the scratches.  But, how do we know his back was not scratched before he took the shirt off?  You don't know. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  So, yes, we do.  It was scratched before he took his shirt off.  Right.  That's what I'm guessing.  It's a bunch of malarkey, sir.  It's a bunch of words.  Excuse my language.  There's no wizardry happening here.  Some wizardry.  My friend Ted was a ghost hunter.  Ted the ghost hunter?  No way.  Yes, he was.  Did he tell you any stories?  No.  He just was.  That's right.  Everyone's saying, so the guy's back couldn't be scratched before?  You guys.  That would be an easy one.  There's no person. 
[01:29:30]  I investigate the paranormal.  Oh, Ted.  Yes.  I investigate ghosts and goblins.  Oh, scary, Ted.  Are you hearing that music or is it just me again?  What music?  Oh, good.  I hear that music often, Gregory.  I investigate ghosts.  You've seen a lot of ghosts?  I've seen many.  Boo.  Ah.  And I leave the premises immediately.  That's not much of a ghost hunter.  I don't.  I just say I was a ghost catcher. 
[01:30:00]  I just find them and leave quickly.  You're scared.  Yes, I am very afraid of ghosts.  So why are you in this business?  Because I want to know where the ghosts are.  So I avoid those places.  Ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  You don't like ghosts?  No.  Ghosts scare me tremendously, Robert.  How many ghosts have you seen?  4,275.  That's a lot of ghosts.  It certainly is, Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, they're terrible.  They come and they go, boo.  And I go, ah.  You run away.  I run as quickly as I can.  Have you ever had a ghost attack, Ted?  Yes, I have.  One knocked my macaroni on the floor.  Mother had made me some macaroni, and there were two ghosts, and they were quarreling, and  they spilled my macaroni.  I used to have a ghost come into my bedroom when I was a boy, and he would do things to  my hiney. 
[01:31:00]  That's terrible.  Yes, he smelled of liquor and cigarettes.  What did he look like?  He looked like my uncle.  He looked cut on the floor of my uncle, and he would put ghostly things in my backside.  That sounds frightening.  It was very scary.  I would yell, and then I would feel this ghostly cigarette-smelling hands around my face.  Why didn't you run away from that?  Because I was small, Anthony.  I couldn't go anywhere.  My feety pajamas were on. 
[01:31:30]  Did he open up the little trap door in the back?  The ghost would rip them down.  He'd go, be quiet, Ted.  Poor young Ted.  I was very upset, Anthony.  I said, oh, boy, I'm going to hunt ghosts for the rest of my life and avoid them.  And avoid them.  Ted is an awful ghost hunter.  I don't like ghosts.  I carry a fan so I can fan them away from me.  They just blow away? 
[01:32:00]  They're wispy apparitions.  That's all we need to do?  Yes, just fan them away.  Ghost shoes.  So keep a fan around.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Mr. Motherfucker.  Mr. Motherfucker, how are you today?  I had a question for Bob.  Okay.  You're leaving everything on TV.  Have you lost land and real estate from Eric Estrada? 
[01:32:30]  What did you say?  Oh, yeah.  Are you buying land from Eric Estrada?  Because it sounds like a good deal.  It really does, though.  Bob is actually right.  There was a ghost, and I saw the actual court document.  Oh, you did.  I certainly did.  And there's a disclaimer.  If you're hurt by ghosts, you're not allowed to sue the proprietor of this establishment.  I've tried suing one time.  I slipped on the icy pavement and hurt my elbow.  And I claimed that ghosts pushed me to the ground angrily. 
[01:33:00]  You seem to have a hard time with that word.  No, I don't.  Angrily.  No.  Ghost.  Oh, ghosts.  Plural of ghosts.  Yes, that's ghosts.  Ghosts.  When was the last time you had a ghost experience?  I see ghosts a couple of times a day.  Have you seen one today?  Yes, I was in a Caldor trying to buy a sweatshirt, and there was a ghost in the sweatshirt rack. 
[01:33:30]  And he went, boo, and I ran away screaming.  At Caldor?  Yes.  I went shopping today in 1987.  Hey, we got Matt who ran away from a ghost once.  Ted, stay close.  We're going to need your expertise here.  Matt, what's up?  Good evening, boys.  Hello, Matthew.  Hey, guys, this story really makes you sound like a fat ass, but a couple years back, we're at some Civil War battlefield, and we're walking down the path, and we hear what to us is a loud scream. 
[01:34:00]  Yes.  Well, we turn away to run, I trip over my fat friend, I turn back to look at what we're just running from, and I run into a fucking sign breaking three ribs.  My friends come over to me, pick me up, they look behind us, there is a fucking ball of light chasing after us.  See, that's proof, this man's sound proof, there are ghosts, and they're chasing us all over reenactment scenes. 
[01:34:30]  Sir, sir, I believe you completely.  My God Almighty, there's ghosts among us.  Ted says so.  Yes, I do.  I was sleeping the other night, I heard a thud, and I knew it was the demons had come to drag me away.  So I sat up and masturbated until the sun came up.  Well, that's a great way to keep the ghosts away.  The ghosts don't come near you when you're doing that for some reason.  No, no.  Is that better than the fan?  What's that?  I heard you. 
[01:35:00]  Ted's a smart ass.  Yeah, Ted's got a little bit.  We are reminded that Bob Kelly also told us he saw a werewolf in Iraq.  Yeah, that is true.  Oh, my God, that's right.  Consider the source.  Wait until it comes out.  And, dude, it was a werewolf in the middle of the road, was it?  Or never.  Ooh, spooky.  Dude, dude. 
[01:35:30]  Well, Ted requested this coming back from break.  Dude, dude.  Yeah.  Hey, we got a guy that actually stayed at this Bob Mackie place.  Want to talk to him?  Yes.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Ooh, I'm debating.  Bob Kelly.  Bobby, I apologize ahead of time.  This line is real.  This line is very good, though.  Brad in West Virginia.  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[01:36:00]  Thank you, Brad.  What's up?  Oh, wrong guy.  Hey, guys.  Actually, I know why Bob Kelly's afraid of ghosts.  Yeah.  Every time he does a stand-up back, all he hears is, boo.  That's hilarious.  That was actually a really good line.  Yeah.  And he delivered it perfectly.  He didn't get over-anxious.  That was a good one.  Good for you.  Where can I buy a ghost?  Oh, this question's coming in for Ted, but Ted's mouth is still full, so we're going to  hold on for one second. 
[01:36:30]  Let's get this real story from Mike in Kentucky.  Mikey?  Mike?  You stayed at the Mackey Place, Mike?  Yeah, I'm from Newport, Kentucky, down there, and I don't know if that was just an urban  myth or what, but man, when I was a kid, I used to hear that all the time.  What?  I was just like, I was just sitting going, I used to hear that all the time, and then  waiting, and then nothing.  What did you hear, sir?  Yeah.  I'm sorry?  I forgot.  Yeah, I heard something in the background.  It was like a voice.  Maybe someone else from Kentucky could help us out. 
[01:37:00]  Jay from Florida, from Wackbag.  Do you guys owe Huey Lewis three bucks now?  Lee, Lee.  All right, let's go to John in Virginia.  We've got a question for Ted.  Stunt with that.  Thought.  I don't see Ted.  I still see Jimmy, but hopefully Ted will be here in time to answer this question.  John in Virginia?  Good morning, boys.  Hello.  Hi.  Yeah, I've got a question for Ted.  I'm experiencing a little paranormal activity around my house.  Where can I pick up some ghost-finding products or anything like that?  You know how it's funny you should ask? 
[01:37:30]  He turned around and came back and said that.  There are plenty of ghost-finding products, and you can get them at Ted's ghost-finding products  from Porium.  I've got everything from fans to other things that make the wind move.  Ted owns so many emporiums.  Excuse me.  My eyes are just acting up.  I get very nervous when speaking of ghosts. 
[01:38:00]  It's a good question, though, sir.  Sometimes what I do is I recommend a hammer, and if a ghost-f is in the area, you just begin  hammering him at whatever chair he's sitting on or table he's next to.  I thought it would go right through a ghost.  It does tend to do that, Anthony.  It's a good point.  I've gotten scolded quite a few times.  Theodore, those are my dishes.  Can you use a vacuum? 
[01:38:30]  A vacuum?  You certainly can if you want to clean up carpet.  But as far as ghost-hunting, no.  Why not?  I don't know.  I never thought of that.  I use a vacuum once to masturbate myself.  I make cubsies inside the vacuum.  My mother said, Theodore, remove your genitals from inside that vacuum hose.  I said, shut up, bitch.  And I fucked from the mouth.  I'm all kidding.  I'm just being racy.  I don't like language like that. 
[01:39:00]  Are there, like, ghosts?  Like black ghosts?  White ghosts?  Puerto Rican ghosts?  Are they all just regular ghosts?  I think they're all just...  I would love to feed into your tomfoolery, Robert.  But I think they're all apparitions.  And they're not based on race or gender or sexual preference.  So there's no women ghosts?  I don't know if there's any woman ghosts.  I never tried to figure the vagina of an apparition.  I tend to fan them away quickly.  He gets very scared.  Yes, I do.  Boo!  Ah! 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  I think a vacuum would work, though, because it would suck him in and then blow him out.  Yes, but then what are you going to do?  You'll have a bag full of ghosts?  Who needs a vacuum bag full of ghosts?  I certainly don't.  Couldn't you take him then and throw them out?  I'm not carrying a bag of ghosts to the dumbwaiter.  The dumbwaiter.  You gotta...  Are you supposed to leave a bag of ghosts?  And then as soon as they go to the garbage truck, it'll go... 
[01:40:00]  It'll burst the bag of ghosts.  We'll become free yet again.  But maybe they'll be down the road and go to somebody else's house.  That's a good point, but I don't want to push my ghost problem off on another, Anthony.  That's very considerate.  Yes, plus I don't think it'll work.  I think he'll come back and haunt me mercilessly.  We need our...  Moo!  We have another question for Ted, the ghost hunter.  He's so scared and runs away.  Yeah, we got Brian in Philly. 
[01:40:30]  Another question?  Yes, good morning.  Good morning.  Ted, we...  Yes, Brian, good luck to the Philadelphia Phillies.  Well, thank you, sir.  Ted, when you...  You're welcome.  When you see ghosts, are they naked or are they wearing clothes?  I see them as smoky apparitions.  I don't see them as faces.  Sometimes like a sheet.  Like Casper often.  Oh.  Yes.  Floating by.  Boo!  Ah!  I one time ran through a patio window because ghosts were trying to pinch my fanny. 
[01:41:00]  It sounds harrowing.  It certainly was harrowing, Anthony.  It's an excellent word for it.  Ted, are you a big fan of the ghost movies?  I don't go for scary movies, Gregory.  I like Disney films.  Yeah.  And films that put a smile on my face.  I don't like horror films.  They frighten me.  Yeah.  Yes, they do. 
[01:41:30]  What was the scariest movie you ever saw?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't make it to the first...  I saw The Exorcist.  Yeah.  That was very frightening.  That is scary.  It certainly is.  I threw the DVD out.  I was very nervous.  Yeah, Little Reagan, her name was.  Oh, I wouldn't know.  I didn't get that far.  The opening music frightened me.  So I removed the DVD and I put in something...  Ah!  Oh, you scared of the music.  She makes pee-pee on the floor.  Yes, I heard that.  That's why I got it.  I thought that would be fun. 
[01:42:00]  I thought it was pornography.  Oh, Lord, I'm tingles, don't you?  Well, this ought to be interesting.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I do something is happening.

[01:46:30]  Tornado Thing.  From the Tornado Thing.  Very tragic.  911 call?  Uh, yes.  Let's, uh, go to it, see what this is about.  In southern Indiana, residents of a mobile home park destroyed in Sunday's deadly tornado  will be allowed home today.  They are being given a couple of hours to search the records for personal belongings.  Meanwhile, we are now hearing frantic 911 calls that victims made in the wake of that storm.  That's on 911.  Oh, my God, there are cars on the side. 
[01:47:00]  Damn you, I need to go see if there are people in these houses.  There are no houses, sir.  There's nothing.  There are no houses.  They're nothing around us.  My brother's bleeding and so is my son.  We've got people trapped in these trains out here.  We have got everybody coming as quickly as they can.  Okay.  Okay.  I hear people screaming everywhere.  22 people died in the storm.  Dozens are still in the hospital.  That's just nuts.  Are there people in those houses?  No, there's no trailer left over here. 
[01:47:30]  There's no trailer park.  Is this God's thing?  Is this God's will again?  Of course it is.  The finger of God.  Yeah, man.  Just goes down there flicking fucking towns.  Poof.  That shit is insanity, man.  I was thinking about these national disasters the last couple days.  And, you know, some people are like, yeah, I see.  It's, you know, it's just attacking the poor people and, you know, the people that we don't  really need on this earth.  And, you know, New Orleans, look who they took out. 
[01:48:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I was thinking about that.  Like, yeah, that's pretty interesting, right?  Yeah, but rich people, they deal with different disasters.  Well, no, what it comes down to, though, with these natural disasters, a long, long time  ago, our ancestors figured this shit out for us.  It was trial and error.  They figured this shit out.  I bet you there was a time they tried to build a city in Tornado Alley and said, you know  what, this shit ain't going to work.  This ain't going to work out.  This ain't working, so we're going to move to a place that's a lot safer than this.  Then they tried down in New Orleans, and all of a sudden they get a flood from a hurricane. 
[01:48:30]  And they said, fuck this.  That ain't going to work.  That ain't going to work.  We've got to stay away.  Maybe we'll move a little further up the coast.  We've educated people with the money.  Well, South Florida, let's face it, South Florida's not a whole bunch of poor people,  you know what I'm saying?  No, but they get the hurricanes.  Yeah, the hurricanes are serious business.  But see, the whole Florida thing is a new phenomenon, I mean, with the old people moving  down there.  What, 30 years?  Not much more than that, but I'm talking about this other shit. 
[01:49:00]  Our ancestors, people that we have no idea what their names are in our own families,  figuring this stuff out.  Fires, man.  Fires always are burning up some rich people.  And mudslides is always, there's rich people dealing with mudslides.  Mudslides.  That's California.  California with the earthquakes and the mudslides, there's really nowhere else you can go.  You might as well abandon the state.  Yeah, but then that comes down to people just saying, you know, I know the rest, but  man, look at the view.  Fuck it.  It's beautiful.  I'm going to go for this.  I'm talking about as a whole society.  You know, they decided not to build New York City in the middle of Tornado Alley. 
[01:49:30]  They knew it just would never work.  Yeah, but New York City has a day after tomorrow coming very soon.  What?  One of those gigantic tidal waves is on the way here.  Little Ice Age tidal wave thing.  Oh, shut up.  As soon as the Canary Islands fall in the ocean.  Yeah, exactly.  I watched that shit.  It's on the way here, man.  The butterfly flaps his wings over Africa.  And the side of the Canary Mountains, the Canary Islands, the Canary Islands are going to  fall in the ocean.  Make a tsunami. 
[01:50:00]  And it's going to be a giant tsunami.  We even figured out all the risks a long time ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, that may happen, but come on.  Stop.  And we're on a fault line.  New York City's on a fault line.  Yeah, but the 113th and...  Yeah, yeah.  Between 113th and 46th is a fault line.  When was the last time you felt a shake, rattle, and roll?  An earthquake in New York.  Every once in a while you wake up and say, hey, we had an earthquake last night.  Really?  Did you feel it?  No.  Some dopey broad in the middle of some suburb felt it.  We got something natural to something coming. 
[01:50:30]  18 feet of snow.  Something delicious is going to happen.  We get unnatural shit.  Yeah, but we figured it all out.  We figured out the odds.  We don't live where it snows like a mother and all that.  And I'm happy about that.  A long time ago, we started paying attention and going, all right, well, I wanted a little  warmer.  We get fucking 767s.  That's what we get.  But the weather was a lot different, man.  There's a lot of things happening.  Industry causes a lot of bad weather, man.  Yeah.  There's been 26 Categories 12s since, like, August. 
[01:51:00]  There's only been one Category 5 ever before the 6 this year.  Can't it happen?  It just happened.  Can't it just happen?  The world is getting pissed off, man.  Back in the 30s and 40s, this country was pumping out more goddamn coal.  There was, like, a constant layer of smoke over the country.  We've actually cleaned our shit up. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  We really did.  Yeah.  Back in the old days.  And we just notice more now because of the smokestacks.  When was the last time you drove around and just saw black smoke billowing out of smokestacks  and, like, Chang, Chang, as Model T's are flying out of a factory.  Chang, Chang, Chang.  That makes a good point.  We have cleaned up our shit pretty good.  We're getting there.  We're fucking clean.  We haven't cleaned it up.  Please clean that shit up.  It's this around-the-clock news and stuff where you're just paying more attention.  Anthony brought up a good point a few weeks back saying, hey, there was a time hurricanes 
[01:52:00]  and tornadoes and all this shit happened.  You didn't have a warning, and you never even read about it.  You were sitting on the beach in fucking the Gulf, and all of a sudden, such a nice day,  but here's some clouds are rolling in, and there's just swirling death a few miles off  there.  You think we should leave?  Hey, over here.  I would just get a little rain.  I think it'll get a little rain.  The ocean just sucked away for six miles.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'm going to go shell collecting.  I bet we get some good shells six miles out.  Oh, there's some fish laying right there. 
[01:52:30]  Bass.  Let's get some.  We're going to eat good tonight.  Listen, I want to go back in time and live where all this horrific shit was happening  and you don't even have a clue.  There must have been a time in the land we're sitting on right now, just living our lives  and on the other side of the world, just millions of people are dying, and you would  go through your entire life and have no fucking clue.  I don't know that there are people that, no one, it's not that people, there's people  still living on the side of Mount Vesuvius. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  There's still people living in Pompeii or whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  No one moved.  Yeah, but that was the first thing we figured out.  Obviously, all right, we're not going to build a city here.  You know, it's trial and error.  It's trial and error.  That's why a lot of these national disasters happen in the poor areas.  Because they're the people that moved in.  In the fucking poor areas.  Because they're the people that moved in.  I'm telling you.  Mother Nature's like a Republican.  Why build a nice house in Tornado Alley when it's going to get destroyed, when you can 
[01:53:30]  just wheel your trailer home in.  How about the fires every week where rich people live?  Where's that?  Someone in the back of Colorado Woods, the big fires that burned down all those rich  white people's homes.  Yeah, yeah.  He got a point.  No, he doesn't have a point.  That's Mother Nature?  Yeah, but then there's also people that are just stubborn in general.  I'm talking about as a group, we figure this shit out.  There'll always be the stubborn people going, fuck that.  I'm building my multi-million dollar house in the middle of Tornado Alley. 
[01:54:00]  When was the last time you saw a major city consumed by a forest fire?  See, that's what I'm saying.  You know, that shit don't happen because they say, we're not going to build it there because  that's where the fires happen.  But you'll get like, I'm going to build my mansion right here on this hill.  Okay, so what made the people build New Orleans where they built it?  Black people didn't build New Orleans, but you know.  It was a great port city.  So wherever the port cities were, that's where cities would pop up.  But to not just make it a port city and then build around it, live there, people should 
[01:54:30]  have stayed fucking back.  Stay back.  Let the railroads go in.  Pick up your goods and take them to where the water doesn't come up every so long.  Those Ohio floods that happened twice a goddamn year, those aren't a bunch of poor people.  I don't think they're just...  I'm just...  My point is...  It's Ohio.  It's Mother Nature.  It makes decisions.  This town is...  This city has got something coming.  No, but you...  You think it does?  You look at the...  Look, they got...  75 feet of snow.  They got the map of America right there. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  You know where the shit is most likely to happen.  And our ancestors figured that out a lot.  They've been saying...  Moved out of those areas to rich and the...  They've been saying the big one is coming forever.  More fortunate.  California.  In California.  Yeah, the big one.  They keep warning us.  It's like, hey, we don't know when, but the big one is coming.  And there's an asteroid with our name on it somewhere.  Well, asteroid, we're all fucked.  Then we're all doomed.  When it happens, it happens.  Because this planet gets bombarded every day with something from outer space.  It's just a big block of cheese is about to hit. 
[01:55:30]  Small enough, it burns up.  We have our protection.  But the big one, you just got to hope the Earth's turned a certain way.  It's not on your house.  It happens to be poor people.  On the other side of the Earth.  I feel bad.  It's just a thought I had.  But poor people, and you know...  I just thought the ancestors figured out the good areas to live.  Poor white people.  And moved out of these straight areas.  Poor white people.  Poor white people.  Poor white people get the tornadoes.  You never fucking see black people going, everything was just taken away in one second.  All that. 
[01:56:00]  New Orleans.  When's the last time you could think of it?  I'm not a history goddamn major, but when's the last time you heard a bunch of black people  really...  We deal with violence most of the time.  Poor black people.  But when's the last time you heard a poor black folks, besides New Orleans, dealing  with some goddamn wind or some water?  You're right.  Or big snow or...  Never!  You are absolutely right.  This is a poor white people problem.  Because they live in the urban areas.  And like we were saying, it's been figured out where to put urban areas. 
[01:56:30]  Why wouldn't they put...  If it's racism like that, why wouldn't they put...  Why wouldn't they make the biggest projects in Tornado Alley?  See?  Let them niggas deal with that wind.  Because we need to get our drugs, man.  We don't want to travel too far.  Not only that, by the time we figured that shit out, you guys were already on to us.  And we go, I'm not moving there.  Oh, you huggies.  There you go.  Trying to put us in the middle of...  Gosh, Ricky, cracker wins.  There you go.  Doing what you do.  Let me tell you, this is a paradise, Tyrone. 
[01:57:00]  You're going to move into this place.  It's going to be wonderful.  Where is it?  Kansas.  It's in Kansas.  It's this luxury fucking apartment building.  What is it?  Kansas.  Kansas.  Kentucky.  Built a couple of them.  That's where them Jayhawks are, right?  Oh, beautiful Jayhawks.  Yeah, you're going to love it.  You're going to love it.  Tyrone.  In Kansas.  That shit is...  It's amazing, man.  Wind kills white people. 
[01:57:30]  Mother Nature.  That's the arrogance, right?  Right there.  The arrogance.  That's why people get their assholes eaten out, is because they don't...  They just...  There's nowhere you can go to stop God's wrath.  No, no.  No way you can go.  There's no fix in it.  There's no...  Eventually, you're probably right.  Eventually, New York will have some huge natural disaster.  Something nasty got to happen.  I think we're much more in danger of ourselves, technology, terrorism, things like that.  We're an Oceanside City or something.  Whatever the water... 
[01:58:00]  We're on the Atlantic, aren't we, somewhere?  Yeah, but nothing happens here.  There ain't...  There isn't this big fucking fault line running that's going to make a tsunami.  The water isn't crazy.  It's not...  And we got a bumper called Long Island.  Long Island, a little buffer there.  A little buffer.  That's nice.  It's keeping everything.  Long Island.  You know.  What's really going to happen?  It's just a stupid theory I'm working on.  You keep working on that one.  Just poor people dealing with this situation. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  I'm thinking the ancestors...  We had all of America.  We're like, all right, hmm.  Covered wagons.  Settled down.  Built a little village.  And you're trying shit out.  Going, all right, let's build a town here.  Ah, fuck.  There's too many tornadoes.  So we'll move it a little further this way.  A little further that way.  Like, why Chicago?  Because Chicago's in the Midwest with all that...  Yeah, but there's...  The horseshit.  It's another port city, though.  Chicago.  Chicago?  Right on the lake.  What?  Right on the lake.  A lot of commerce comes into Chicago on the lake.  On the lake?  A great lake.  There's a great lake.  But is that... 
[01:59:00]  There's no outlets.  Is there an outlet for that lake?  There you go.  You could get up into Canada.  You could get out.  Didn't Lewis and Clark find a way?  Or that other two guys?  I don't know.  The lakes are...  They're massive, man.  And there were a lot of cities...  Henry Hudson.  There were a lot of cities on the lake, and now they're not rebuilding those areas anymore.  Because they don't want to live there.  Where's that?  Like, Buffalo.  Oh.  Has its problems.  We'll see.  That's a stupid city.  That's the dumbest city in the United States.  They had a lot of industry up and down... 
[01:59:30]  I'll say it.  Buffalo.  Up and down the coast to the right.  That lake there.  That is somewhere that...  Why is Buffalo from Dublin City?  Years ago, when Opie was talking about when we were trial and error, you set up a little  village.  If it lasts, it builds.  It gets bigger and bigger.  If it gets blown away or frozen over or something, you move on.  You go somewhere else.  Buffalo, for some reason, decided, hey, this place is a fucking freezer.  But, yeah, let's stay here.  And every year, they get snowed in to where...  What?  You walk down the sidewalks and the snow is over your head, right? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I spent like three winters there.  There's no reason to have a major city in that kind of cold.  But, God bless them.  Sit there watching their...  They just knew where to build them.  Like, they built them there and they said, oh, shit, this is...  This is a lot of wet right here.  Let's get out of here.  How many towns...  How many of these, like, booming fucking honky-tonk piano-playing saloon places just blew  away?  Yeah.  But then, who was alive to go, maybe we should...  Listen to me. 
[02:00:30]  It would take too many years for trial and error to go...  A couple of hundred.  You know what?  That's where the Doppler comes in.  And that's where you go...  People move now.  They didn't move then.  They stayed.  No.  I think their town blew away and they said, fuck this.  And the architect died.  Pack up the wagon.  We're going.  Yeah.  We're going to...  And then they'd hook up somewhere else.  We're going to move to higher ground or what have you.  They'd talk to some people and go, did your town ever blow away here?  And they'd go, no.  All right.  We'll build.  Then they'd lick their index finger and go, okay, this feels okay here.  All right. 
[02:01:00]  Let's just build it here.  The finger 5,000.  The finger 5,000.  This took hundreds of years and I think we're still trying to figure that out.  Still trying to figure it out.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Now we get hit by those 100, 200-year storm things that happen and go, uh-oh.  See, we didn't know because...  Arizona.  Arizona's becoming the new rage for the old people, right?  Maybe...  Because of no pollen and...  Yeah, but 12 degrees.  All the old people said...  It's right.  All the old people said, fuck, we could get around America a lot faster.  Let's move south and live in Florida.  Right?  But now maybe they're starting to figure out it wasn't the greatest idea after all. 
[02:01:30]  And now they're trying out Arizona.  It's happening as we speak.  It's 10,000 degrees.  People, you can't escape it.  It's happening as we speak.  But in general, I think we, uh, our ancestors figured this shit out a long time ago.  I like dealing with the snow.  I'll take the snow.  I feel comfortable that even if there's some evil snowstorm, that we could still make it through.  It's L.A.  They don't have a lot of large buildings.  Well, because of the earthquakes, man.  Yeah.  Well, there was a time they were building large buildings.  True, true.  And they kept being knocked out saying, what the fuck are we doing? 
[02:02:00]  True.  San Francisco had to be knocked down a few times before they realized you can't just sit in the building.  But why didn't they realize, get out of there?  See, that's going to your thing.  Okay.  I think.  Why not?  Let's get the hell out of here.  It was later on and they started looking at it and going, we can, this is a great place.  We can beat this shit.  Yeah.  Now, let's start putting shock absorbers in the building.  Because we are pompous.  And stuff.  We can beat this shit.  We can beat this shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we'll just build shorter buildings.  Shorter buildings.  And that's our problem.  We can beat this.  You might as well just live as best you can, man. 
[02:02:30]  But everyone jokes about Tornado Alley and, you know, why don't they leave.  It's just poor people.  They're just.  They can't just go.  Where else are they going to move?  That's what they got.  That's it for them.  You just can't just get up and go when you're poor.  And if you don't have a big extended family somewhere, where are you going to go?  So I'm just, you know what?  I think I'm going to go on to New York.  Let's rustle up the horses and ride out of.  Jed, Jed, pack up the car.  We're going to New York.  What businessman that owns a big company is going to take the chance to build, like, 
[02:03:00]  a huge Walmart in the middle of Tornado Alley?  Seriously.  Well, there are a few of those.  Well, you think, okay, let's take it.  When they finish building the new World Trade Center, right?  Yeah.  Are business people going to still rent office space in there?  Yeah, because just like San Francisco thought they had the earthquakes figured out and fixed  it, we can fix it.  Yeah.  Now we've got defenses in place.  You know, odds are it's going to be very hard for them to get a hold of a few fucking 
[02:03:30]  passenger jet airlines these days.  Very hard for them to pull that off again.  That's a one-time deal.  Let's say hi to Jim in Colorado.  Jim?  Oh, hey.  How's it going there?  I was just calling to say that most of our cities and stuff like Boston and Chicago were  Indian villages.  Yeah, the Indians had a few.  And they'd been here for quite some time.  They had a few hundred years themselves to figure out where to live.  Yeah.  That's right.  And then we killed them with...  Killed those motherfuckers. 
[02:04:00]  I'm glad he said that.  That's funny.  We murdered them all and took their land because they said, damn, these Indians are living pretty  damn good.  They did all the work for us and then we swept in and said, yeah, this is a good place to live.  Don't build here.  Winter, no buffalo come.  No build them here.  Big wind sent down to destroy planes.  We live...  Oh, so you're saying here's cool?  Yes.  Here, good place.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know something?  That's actually genius, man.  Anything that makes sense, makes sense to me, man. 
[02:04:30]  That makes a lot of sense.  The Indians came.  They were here.  How long have you been here?  Mm.  Two.  Many moons.  Many moons.  Many, many moons.  And it's like, all right, nice talking to you.  Here's some liquor and some corn.  Anything bad happen here?  No.  But last village, big spinning wind god comes.  Take village away.  Spinning wind god.  Okay, we don't live where spinning wind god is.  Right, right.  I gave my daughter last month.  Me give daughter last month.  Still, spinning wind god. 
[02:05:00]  Spinning wind god.  Then we move.  We move further, so more warmth.  And we go to water.  But then big spinning water god comes.  And take village away.  Oh, we're spinning water god.  I don't like the sound of him.  Where else are you going?  I don't like the sound of him.  Built, went west, further toward where sun set him.  And then big shaky god, shake our village down.  I'm glad you're seeing it my way, finally.  There's some logic in this. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  There's some logic in this.  I go with that because at least it gives the Indians the...  I like a story that makes white people the villain.  The bad guy.  Like, Obie's story, white people was like, hey, man, we came here and we would build.  And that's what we did.  But it's like, okay, the Indian thing I can go with.  I said, like, answer.  I mean, a long time ago.  I mean, Tornado Alley is not all of a sudden going to be the East Coast.  Big spinning wind god.  Big spinning windum god.  We absolutely, as white people, we're not the bad guys in that either. 
[02:06:00]  I got to defend Whitey when it comes to the Indians and the United States of America.  Patrice is looking at me like I'm insane.  How?  You know what?  That's so outrageous.  Please defend slavery first.  First.  Because that's so outrageous that you would say we're not the bad guys in this?  I have to explain why.  That's why they own these casinos now because of your goddamn guilt for what you did to them. 
[02:06:30]  That's not guilt.  That's them finally coming around and saying let's assimilate and find out how to make some money off of these white people.  No, that's like because they said, okay, listen, we fucked you over so bad, we're going to give you this land, and our government has nothing to do with what you do.  So they got smart and built fucking casinos, and they can't tax them, they can't do all of that shit.  It was classic we're sorry for what we did.  Right, because we'd have absolutely been able to say we're going to tax you, we're going to do this, and go fuck yourself. 
[02:07:00]  What are you going to do about it?  Right, man, it's guilt.  But in the beginning here, I'm talking when we first came over as a race of explorers and conquerors.  Criminals!  Well, no.  You know what?  It's a different time now.  Let me ask you something.  It sure is.  You ever play Monopoly?  You ever play Monopoly?  Yes.  Doesn't your strategy change from the beginning of the game to the middle to the end of the game? 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  The beginning of the game of what I call civilization on Earth.  Okay.  I call it the beginning of imperialism myself.  It was different.  You went somewhere.  If you were stronger than who was there, you took their shit.  If someone else was stronger than you, they took your shit.  Up until a certain point when we started figuring out, maybe this isn't right now because of the times we're living in.  But at the beginning, it was all a matter of coming over, kicking ass, and taking the property.  Conquering.  The beginning of Monopoly.  What do you do? 
[02:08:00]  Click, click, click.  Move your dog.  Move your thimble.  Buy.  Buy it.  I'm buying.  I'm buying this.  I'll buy that.  Everything you land on, you buy, buy, buy.  Then once you have the shit, now you start negotiating.  I'll trade you Park Place for all the yellows.  But how do you trade what you took?  Look, it's the beginning of the game.  You're a conqueror.  That's right.  You're leaving your nation, going to some unknown land.  Is that the defense of those weak, weak engines?  That was the time. 
[02:08:30]  If they can't hold their shit.  The criminals came from England with muskets.  Criminals.  And pelletballed these poor people who all they had to do was relax.  They didn't eat their turkey.  They could have come here, and there could have been 50-foot giants with laser beam eyes  and kicked their fucking ass.  The balls, they had to come over here, not knowing who was over here.  You motherfuckers.  It was their luck that there was some fucking scrawvoid dragon, not invented the wheel yet, 
[02:09:00]  motherfuckers.  You know what, Anthony?  Master Johnson was an adventurer.  I just realized that.  It was a stroke of luck that there were people that hadn't even invented the wheel yet  that were sitting here hunting, living off the land, that we could come here and kick  their ass and take their shit.  But that's not a defense.  It is absolutely.  That is what was happening in the world back then.  It was the norm.  That is absolutely. 
[02:09:30]  It was accepted behavior in this world.  So now it's not accepted behavior.  Right.  The game changed.  But we still embrace what you're saying, how we got it, that this country knows it was  wrong, but you still embrace what you did.  You realize the ideology is wrong, but you still embrace what you did.  I do.  A lot of people don't.  It's not a common, it's not a popular ideology to have.  I embrace it.  Give it back to the Indians.  I look at it like...  It wasn't wrong for the time. 
[02:10:00]  No.  You hopped on ships.  That's all the rage, conquering.  It wasn't conquering.  That's what people did back then.  What are you doing?  I'm an explorer.  I'm a conqueror.  Yeah.  That was pretty much it.  When you look back now, it looks a little ugly.  Sure.  But at the time, it wasn't wrong.  Do you remember the set of balls you had to have to hop on a wooden ship?  That's right.  Why?  Take a couple of months to cross an ocean.  Why?  When you was relaxing in Spain.  Because you needed more land.  To send your people where?  To kick some ass to be the top dog.  But there was never immigration until 1900. 
[02:10:30]  The criminals.  Let me tell you.  How could you be a criminal when there was no one had a say on who owned what?  Because England threw the stinking pilgrims out.  That's what Australia is.  Australia is a prison colony.  A bunch of criminals that England got rid of.  They were criminals.  This country was founded by criminals.  There's no explorers.  No.  Australia's different.  Criminals were sent over there.  And so they were sent here.  The pilgrims were fucking criminals from England.  Right.  They were having problems with the English government.  They were adventurers. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yes, they were.  You know, they were the get the fuck out of our countryers.  Right.  That's what they were.  They weren't like explorers.  Okay.  I'll give you that they were get the fuck out of our country.  But they were explorers.  They didn't know what was in there.  They didn't know what was over here.  They were thrown out.  If I throw you out the house.  Okay.  Here's what they call homeless people now.  Homeless people should be called explorers.  Because you throw a motherfucker out.  It's like he's an explorer now.  Because he lived in a box 80 blocks away.  Hey, this motherfucker just explored 12th Avenue. 
[02:11:30]  I invented 12th Avenue.  You know I found it.  I found it.  They weren't explorers.  They were sent over.  Columbus was sent over as an explorer to explore the new world.  He was a conqueror.  I give you him.  And he didn't even conquer everybody.  But he was a conqueror.  That guy was a conqueror.  England was conquerors.  How about the tribes in Africa?  You don't think they were doing the same shit?  They're still doing that shit.  Those motherfuckers are still cutting each other up. 
[02:12:00]  You don't think the tribes in Africa are looking for better places to live?  Can I be honest with you?  I'm going to be honest with you too, white gentlemen.  I'm going to tell you something.  Yeah.  About my history.  Yeah.  One thing that I never grasped.  And I have to grasp.  Somebody has to teach me this.  Yeah.  Is how.  Because that's the first thing white people say when it comes to slavery.  You sold yourself.  Right, right.  I don't understand what that means.  I don't understand how black people had to do with slavery.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  It's like the village head muckety-muck guy who would make a deal with the Europeans that 
[02:12:30]  would come over with the boats and sell his people or another tribe that they would capture  to the whitey.  So roots was a lie.  That white people just came in with a couple of things and tied around their neck and stole  some black people?  I think it would be difficult for a bunch of Europeans to circumnavigate the jungles  to go finding you guys and bringing them into a boat.  Go find you guys.  I think it's easier to get a muckety-muck that knows the lay of the land.  Go find you guys. 
[02:13:00]  Who needs their ass eating?  Who needs their ass eating?  You put a middle man in there.  He knows where the good spots are.  You go risk getting your ass eaten.  You think I can stay on the shore here close to the boat?  Motherfucker come right out of the jungle.  They eat an asshole!  Don't go in there!  Motherfucker's fast.  Fuck that.  Don't come back, tiger.  Make a deal.  Make a deal with somebody that knows the lay of the land.  Y'all just accept that shit.  White people always think a way to absolve themselves from guilt is like, hey, that's what they 
[02:13:30]  was doing back there, conquering.  Hey, y'all, we made deals.  Once we figured out you guys actually were human beings, then that's when the problem  started, and it had to be remedied, and slavery had to be abolished.  But at first...  I don't believe slavery...  I don't believe slavery...  You gotta give a...  I don't think it was personal at first.  Right.  It's business.  Because now, I just don't think that black people aren't slaves because anybody became 
[02:14:00]  good people.  I just think, what you gonna do?  Have a nigga fax something, you know, fax this nigga, or, hey, you know...  We gotta educate.  You gotta give us a break, man.  You know, we're gonna process this shit, motherfucker.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I think that it became...  It just reached a point where slavery wasn't a viable thing anymore?  It wasn't viable.  Because I don't think that we're not slaves because it's such a wonderful place now.  It's just, it is what it is. 
[02:14:30]  It's just no place for it.  When the cotton gin came around, and they don't...  They didn't...  Yeah.  It could pick thousands more, whatever, pounds of cotton an hour than a black guy.  It was like, hey, who needs slavery?  Nice talking to you.  Now, I'm not saying, oh, it wasn't racist, but because that was one of the things implemented  to keep us in control, you know what I'm saying?  It was also Lincoln's idea of fucking the South.  Right.  The South ran on slaves, ran on slaves, and you take that away, and now you're fighting 
[02:15:00]  a war with the South.  All of a sudden, you take away what does their work.  That's why Lincoln...  Lincoln wasn't this, you know, I love black people.  Right.  No.  This is morally reprehensible, and we...  That's like the selling point, but the truth of the matter was, I want to break the South's  spine.  That's what we're going to do.  I think that this country is, like you said, poor people, it's a thing for poor people.  It's very sensible to put a poor white man, the best weapon you can use against a poor 
[02:15:30]  white man, is convince him that this country's yours.  And really, it's not yours.  It's to convince him, like, hey, man, you know what?  There's a nigga living better than you.  Some rich white guy going, a nigga's down the street living better than you.  Go get him, white man.  This is the white man's country.  Go get him.  Go get him.  Because it's a dream, you're selling that entitlement shit where you go, how the hell can I be broke?  How can I watch... 
[02:16:00]  This is why white people hate T.O.  How can I watch this nigga who's making this much millions of dollars, and I should be doing  that, and this is my goddamn country?  Do you think that thinking is still going on widespread?  Motherfucker, people from Poland...  Entitlement?  People from Poland are in the Klan saying, get out of my country.  Polish descendants are saying, go back to Africa or whatever you're going to do.  And I'm like, you just got here last week.  Your people just got here, you Polack.  How can you be racist? 
[02:16:30]  It's not the fault of the people that we're this way when it comes to racism.  We need racism to keep it going.  I don't think it's racism, though.  I don't think it's race.  I think it's just economics.  I think any poor guy looks and goes, I'm entitled, white, black, or anything.  Black guys will walk around all the time and go, I am working at McDonald's, motherfucker.  I see this guy at IBM making money.  I ain't fucking...  And it's like, how about you start there and work yourself up?  It's a TV show.  It was on last night.  I ain't working at no motherfucking McDonald's. 
[02:17:00]  No, it's just...  People seem entitled.  Yeah, they look at other more successful people, black or white, and go, you know, what the fuck?  Why is this guy living better than me?  It's more divide and conquer.  Because most of the McDonald's is nothing but young black kids.  But that's another fuel for these goofy Africans and Haitians that come over, and they go, you disgust...  They do what you did, because there's a Haitian doing an impression of a black kid going, I ain't going to work at no motherfucking McDonald's.  So they go, how can they do this when they handle the ting with the ting in McDonald's? 
[02:17:30]  I work so hard to make not just one cent.  One cent.  One cent.  They pay you $5 an hour just to flip a burger.  Well, here's a question I got.  Get on, man.  Here's a question I got.  Why are you guys still holding a grudge?  We have to.  Why?  I'm going to tell you why.  We turned you on to America.  You know what?  Let me tell you.  This is a great place. 
[02:18:00]  Let me tell you why.  You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for us.  Ready?  Jesus.  Ready?  Here is the problem.  All right.  And we had nothing to do with this shit.  But you take white.  You take whiteness.  Whiteness and blackness.  This is another thing.  We have that color thing that black people took black.  Like I said, I'm half Asian.  Like I'm really not from slavery.  For real.  For real.  Like my family, it doesn't go back that far.  But I take slavery.  You take whiteness. 
[02:18:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  When you have a personal history, you're not a colonial white guy who owned a slave.  You're Irish, right?  No.  What are you?  I'm a mutt.  You're not.  I'm a little bit of a colonial.  Here's the problem that black people have.  Ready?  Here's the fucking problem.  Mm-hmm.  The reason why it seems that Jews, right, have moved on from the Holocaust.  Meaning the Holocaust is a separate entity from their existence.  They go, this is a part of our history.  But they done moved on.  Never to be forgotten.  Never to be forgotten.  But they will still do business with a smile with Mercedes Benz. 
[02:19:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  But what happened with black folks?  Here's the problem.  We, I said this years ago.  We do not have a Hitler.  We do not have a group that we can go.  Like, white people are our Hitler.  We have a color that we just don't like white people because that's the mustache y'all got.  The white skin is the Hitler mustache.  We don't.  There's no finality for us.  It's just like, okay, you free, nigga.  Can we have, like, you know, this guy, John Skippenbrook, who started slavery? 
[02:19:30]  We don't even have a, we don't have the originator of slavery.  We have a picture of the motherfucker.  No closure.  No closure.  You need the guy.  We need something to go, hey, America is great.  But you got to still be.  You need a guy that can be put up on a dartboard.  That we can go, okay, white person, I don't have to dislike you.  Just because you're white, I can dislike Hitler face over here. 
[02:20:00]  Right, right.  You need a symbol.  Jews have Hitler.  And about eight other motherfuckers you can name by name.  Himmler, Heimlich, Mingler.  They got a bunch of.  Watch that Heimlich maneuver.  That's when they sweep around the outside.  Is it Heidrich?  Not Heimlich.  Heidrich.  Whatever.  Heidrich.  Where would your people be if it wasn't for slavery?  Would you have come over to America?  Would you have come over to America under your term?  We would be in Africa not comparing our existence to anything.  We would be like, we'd be in Africa living how we live. 
[02:20:30]  But there would be no, damn, I wish I was over there with them white people and Indians.  We would just be living how we live.  Who the hell knows how we'd be living?  There would probably also be immigration.  People coming over here, being successful.  We would probably went to England.  Which is what they're doing now.  England is dealing with Africans now.  That's why there's racism in Ireland now.  Yeah.  Because there wasn't because there was no blacks there.  Now, there's blacks there.  They're like, what the, who are you motherfuckers?  But they need blacks to come over and work. 
[02:21:00]  They're growing like that.  Yeah.  So I'm saying that's what our anger is.  Our anger is we just, we just free and now we just live with you.  Like, hey, how you doing?  We don't even, we don't bother with you guys anymore.  It's all about the Arabs.  But at least Jews, they don't look, Jews have a way to not, Arabs are the new niggas.  That's why I'm so happy that they're how they are right now.  Now we got somebody else.  Somebody else that a black person can know what it's like to be a racist.  White and black alike can just not stand somebody. 
[02:21:30]  Can not like Arabs together.  This might help us all out.  Come on, let's hold hands.  Thank you, Terrence.  Hold hands.  Kumbaya.  Let's go.  Come on.  Let's sing We Shall Overcome.  Thank you, Terrence, so much.  Because I know how to be racist.  They united.  Now it's all about the, I saw your HBO special.  Dibble, dabble, dabble.  Yeah.  Now it's all about them.  Dibble, dabble, dabble, dabble, dabble.  It's all about them now, right?  That's for them doctors, man.  They're goddamn doctors.  Dibble, dabble, fat.  Dibble, dabble, pills.  Just coming over here arrogant. 
[02:22:00]  Because they come over and they become doctors and they think that I ain't shit because I ain't a doctor.  You had the opportunity to be a double, dabble, dabble, dabble.  Dibble, dabble, dabble, dabble.  Dibble, dabble, dabble, dabble.  Dibble, dabble, dabble, dabble.  There are a lot of, like, Indian doctors.  Because they think you ain't shit when you come over here and you don't take advantage of what this country has to offer.  Fuck you, you foreigners.  Asians, 15 of them living in one room.  They're working like 80 hours a day.  And, you know, people respect that work ethic.  Ugh. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  I hate that they're behind the cashiers.  I work hard to be lazy.  I love being lazy.  I hate the fact that they're behind the cashiers.  No personality whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  I feel sorry for your mother.  What'd you say?  What?  What?  Who the?  I love that scene, man.  He keeps playing the tape for his friends.  What'd you say?  I feel sorry for your mother.  For your mother.  Go get the tape, bitch.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.

[02:27:30]  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole!  You guys suck!  Serious XM.  Then you got Jason from Cal Class.  Have it on this one.  I'm streaming XM from my iPhone so I can listen to you in class.  There isn't much this thing can't do.  Yes, except fucking...  There's a lot of things that can't do.  I'll tell you what it can't do.  Get online in under 45 minutes so I can fucking go to check my AOL mail or something else I  want to check.  Well, you being on AOL is fucking sad.  I'm a cunt, too.  It's just sad.  I'm not saying I'm not. 
[02:28:00]  But how about put a little bit more fucking hard drive space on it?  He could have done that.  He didn't want to.  There's no hard drive in it.  That's what I remember.  Well, before it came out, we were here saying that it's just...  It's a really good iPod, even if we don't use it as a phone.  Yeah.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  It's got a 10th of space.  Regular iPods have 80 gigabytes.  Yeah.  This has eight gigabytes.  I put my shows...  I record every show I do, and I put them on my iPod to listen to.  I can fit three hour-long shows, and it's fucking full.  It's a piece of shit. 
[02:28:30]  Fucking faggots.  Well, I brought up...  If you have an iPhone, whoever's listening in class, you're a faggot in your class listening  and your faggot iPhone, fucking shove it up your ass and cum out of your dick into your  own face.  Well, I brought up the whole iPhone thing to lead to a clip from 1967.  1967?  They're talking about the future.  The future?  The future.  What was going to happen in the future?  1967, film called 1999 A.D. 
[02:29:00]  Wow, that was the future.  Which is now, what, eight years ago?  Yep.  Wow.  Which predicts online shopping, banking, and email.  No way.  1967, talking about the future.  Fingertip shopping will be one of the many homemakers' conveniences.  This video console will be channeled into the store of her choice.  There, a camera will scan a display of wares, which she will select by push button. 
[02:29:30]  She won't have to deal with Negroes.  That's true, though.  I knew what you said.  Another part of this console is a household monitor screen, which maintains a watch on  critical areas in the house, swimming pool, or yard.  I don't like that.  That's what everybody had a swimming pool.  What the wife selects on her console will be paid for by the husband at his counterpart 
[02:30:00]  console.  All bills and transactions will be carried out.  I can't trust her.  No.  She'll buy her feminine products and things to make black eyes go away.  Wow, man.  And the husband will pay first.  We'll pay.  Yeah.  Don't let her go crazy.  See what happened?  They even knew back then.  So part of the integrated system was that there's a whole separate console for the husband  So that's like the pilot's seat.  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:30]  And she's just in the co-pilot's seat.  Oh, my God.  I want to hear the last part again.  I don't want her to, you know, have say over what she can buy.  Hold on.  ...areas in the house, swimming pool, or yard.  What the wife selects on her console will be paid for by the husband at his counterpart  console.  Oh, my God.  All bills and transactions will be carried out electronically.  Wow.  Electronically.  Electronically.  That's funny.  She can pick out her shit, and then the husband goes, no, no, no.  All right, I'll let you have this.  Fuck you. 
[02:31:00]  Fuck you.  Her console is like the little fake steering wheel that the kid pretends to drive the car.  Not even hooked up.  Exactly, with a little fake rubber horn in the middle.  Give her a choice.  You can either get breath mints or tampons.  Oh, damn, that's good.  Isn't that amazing?  There's a little more.  I can't believe it's 1967.  67.  The future.  1967.  Sounds like it's from the 50s.  Yes.  Well, this is like the 50s or the...  This is the 40s. 
[02:31:30]  40s, sure.  What the hell is this?  Apparently, music is not going to change at all.  Yes.  It'll stay exactly the same.  Benny Goodman will still be a hit in the future.  Benny Goodman with his hit, Umbrella, Ella, Ella, Ella.  This will be fantastic in the future.  You can be at the office and look in at your wife at home and we'll have a boxing glove on  an accordion.  And if you want to punch her in the face for not working, just press a button at work. 
[02:32:00]  There she...  Down she goes.  See her stagger to her feet.  Now she's learned a lesson.  Rich from Manhattan, is this part of the Carousel of Time in Disney?  Please update that effing ride.  Yeah.  What's the Carousel of Time?  I don't remember the Carousel of Time.  That's at Disneyland.  Spaceship Earth is the best.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Communication.  It started with papyrus. 
[02:32:30]  You know, and they show all this stuff.  And their, like, present day one is 20 years old.  A typewriter.  Exactly.  They show all this fiber optic stuff and these blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, spacey noises.  Everything will be buttons of different colors that flash and don't...  They're not even labeled.  It's wonderful.  It has flashing lights, fiber optic, and tapes that go back and forth and back and forth  for no apparent reason. 
[02:33:00]  Why is it still the 40s?  Could at least put on some Jimi Hendrix.  It was the 60s.  This is the go-to music, though.  Yes, right you are for this voice.  And look around the neighborhood.  You won't see any of them.  They're staying in the past.  Yes.  We're going to leave them here.  The future will be wonderful.  Look around your neighborhood.  Yes, your daughter Betsy can walk around in safety. 
[02:33:30]  You have the iPhone.  They had the rotary phone.  This is in the future.  Great.  The future.  We have more audio from 1967.  A central bank computer will debit the family's account the amount of purchases and credit  the department store.  They were talking about online fucking banking in 1967?  Pretty much it.  Wow.  They just thought it was video.  That's all.  They thought it was like video cameras pointing.  Yeah, you'd have to actually look at something live. 
[02:34:00]  They thought it was all video surveillance being integrated.  They couldn't figure out that you could do it a lot easier with just pictures.  Just capture a digital picture.  GIFs.  They didn't know about that.  Who's going to be working all that?  Who's going to be working all these cameras?  GIF is a great peanut butter.  Yeah.  That's all I know.  Make a picture of it?  You're talking silly.  Uh-oh, what happened?  I'll be.  That's true.  Come on, I wanted to hear the rest of that.  ...purchases and credit the department store, for example. 
[02:34:30]  Ah, for example.  ...informing the family's home computer at the same time.  Father, at the touch of a button, receives an instantaneous printed copy of his budget,  the amount of taxes he owes, the payments left on the car, and so forth.  And what that pesky cunt spent on clothes.  ...  ...  ...  I love the fact that just Dumbbell does some shopping while the man figures out the client. 
[02:35:00]  The guy's got to figure everything out while stupid's just pressing buttons because the  pretty dresses were pretty colors.  My wife has an old magazine, a really old magazine, and it's, there's an ad for some  kind of silk sheets, like some designer sheets.  Yeah.  And the ad is a cartoon of a woman sitting in bed, a really fancily, and the point of  the ad is, how are you going to explain to your husband that you bought this, so he  won't be mad?  And they show a guy walking in the bedroom with a briefcase, and he looks really mad. 
[02:35:30]  He looks pissed.  And she has this sheepish smile, and they give her points, like bullet points.  How about a blowjob?  Here's the things to say to him so he won't beat you, basically.  He's like, these are cheaper than other brands, these will last a long time.  If you can get it out of your mouth before he cracks you in it.  Yeah, exactly, that's what it looks like.  Like, darker-skinned men will slide off it, as opposed to being able to violate me.  And you know his breath just smells like fucking whiskey and martinis. 
[02:36:00]  A cigarette.  He's all drunk.  Fifteen drinks on the fucking Metro line train.  A little observation, though.  We're trying to find that, and so far we got how to turn a person in bed.  We'll be doing that.  All right.  Car, and so forth.  All documents and household records are available on the video screen for immediate reference.  Wow.  Also at his disposal is an electronic correspondence machine, or home post office. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, email.  Which allows for instant written communication between individuals anywhere in the world.  That'll never happen.  Wow.  To maintain these and hundreds of complex electronic circuits, a monitor checks all circuits every  few seconds, inserts a backup circuit if and when trouble develops, and alerts the communal  service agency for replacement.  The music gets scary there.  Yeah, the server was like fucking up.  My mother's a computer programmer, and they installed a new machine called a Sun machine, 
[02:37:00]  like this really huge machine that they had to put their software on.  So they put it in their office and plugged it in.  And then two days later, there was a guy from UPS saying he had a part for the machine,  and nobody ordered it.  Oh, shit.  And it turns out the machine ran a self-diagnosis.  Oh, my God.  Found a faulty part, got into their system, and ordered it through UPS.  Cyberdyne.  It summoned peace to itself, paid for it out of their accounts. 
[02:37:30]  It's becoming aware.  It's becoming aware.  Fucking crazy.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  They unplugged it, and they're like, we're not.  It's fucking machines ordering shit.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  That's too fucked up.  Fucking whatever.  There's like a everybody loves Raymond Bach set.  Yeah.  It starts ordering shit.  They're like, no, I needed it.  Pizzas.  You know.  It's coming to the door.  That's pretty cool.  All right, listen.  You know what?  I wanted to say that the computer ordered, but I just didn't have the guts. 
[02:38:00]  What?  A freshener for your mother's chair, because they're trying to stay.  But you didn't have the guts.  For my mother's chair.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  But you didn't have the guts, though.  It's the first thing it ordered.  It's the first thing it ordered.  I don't have a sense of smell, but that woman's cunt is disgusting.  That does not compute.  Too bad you weren't brave enough to say it, though.  No, I would never disperse it.  Next day delivery.  I can't take another day of this. 
[02:38:30]  Goddamn, Jim.  I just see him giggling over there, and I wonder what he's got in his head, and it's that.  Couldn't fire it out fast enough.  This is the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.

All right, now we can really get into this.  We're in the middle of duty wars.  I don't know how it happened. 
[02:43:00]  Duty wars.  But we got some duty wars happening now.  Duty wars.  Look, man, I don't know, but we have to go with it, you know.  Started with Big Boy Made a Duty.  Big Boy Made a Duty.  And then the follow-up video, which was Duty Hat.  Duty Hat.  Oh, boy, a duty hat.  And this is where the listeners, some of you, some, some, very small, small some, don't really understand the creative process. 
[02:43:30]  No.  Because I had to hear and read how, oh, the setup for the Big Boy Made a Duty, oh, it just wasn't worth it.  And the duty had follow-up just now.  Oh, the setup hours, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Op.  It got us to this point.  That's why you got to understand the creative process of a radio show a little more than you do.  We didn't know at the time, when we were pulling our duty shenanigans over here.  Right.  That across a few blocks down, Eastside Dave was doing his own thing. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  And now these two worlds are colliding.  Big time.  And it all started because of the crappy Big Boy Made a Duty video.  Big Boy Made a Duty video.  I don't know.  I think our guys were feeling their oats.  Feeling pretty good.  Feeling pretty undefeatable.  Unbeknownst to us.  I think our guys thought that they couldn't be beat, as far as a stunt went, especially with eating, when eating is involved. 
[02:44:30]  Now, we got...  Can I say unbeknownst, though?  Unbeknownst to us.  Unbeknownst to us.  Unbeknownst.  I like benounced.  Benounced.  Eastside Dave was paying close attention.  Yes.  And took these duty wars to the next level.  He ate duty yesterday on the Ron and Fez show.  Oh. 
[02:45:00]  It horrified everybody.  Master Poe is puking.  By the way, I see the allegiance Master Poe has.  I'm not stupid.  I listened to every single second of the Ron and Fez show yesterday.  People don't think I listen, but I do.  And Master Poe is beating up our guy, Cream Pie Jones, and then treating him like shit yesterday.  Throwing him out of the studio.  What was that about?  Yeah.  Here's a little bit more allegiance to Ron and Fez.  He said, that was very obvious to me yesterday, by the way.  Yeah.  That didn't go unnoticed by the Opster. 
[02:45:30]  No.  Chocolate Red.  Cream Pie Jones.  Got defeated yesterday.  Monster Rain.  He had done his duty hat gag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And got his hair full of shit.  And we got cocky.  And thought, cocky.  And we thought this guy would do anything.  He could beat anybody as far as stunting went. 
[02:46:00]  Especially with eating or drinking something.  Well, Eastside Dave just lost his fucking mind yesterday when Cream Douche showed up at the studio over there.  By the way, we didn't set that up.  For some reason, Cream Pie Jones and the boys decided to go over to XM.  I guess they actually had work to do.  They do some work over there.  Or was that the deal then?  Because we're setting up the bits.  We've got to play this stuff from Ron and Fez yesterday.  And then we're going to bring it to the next level.  Yes, then.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Because we have to mill around the office to wrap up certain tasks in Cream.  Mill around.  Yes.  Basically, you've got to make believe that you're working.  I'm with you.  Because I do the same thing.  And does the same thing.  I understand you have to be over at XM, even though there's no studio being built.  And no one else works down in Washington.  But you guys have to at least make it look good.  I get it.  If I leave with the talent, some eyebrows get raised.  Yeah, I understand.  I just want to acknowledge that.  So you went over there to make believe you were still working. 
[02:47:00]  And Jared apparently was also making believe.  And Cream Pie Jones.  Sorry, I forgot his.  Ran into Eastside Dave.  Yeah.  And we got the audio.  Oh, Dave just lost his mind.  Well, here's Ron and Fez.  They start their show yesterday talking about Cream Pie Jones.  That would be you, Iraq.  And, yes, ladies and gentlemen, the radio war has started.  This has been a long time coming.  And, finally, today, they just went too far. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, and I bragging about this.  New Johnny come lately.  Nothing happened in Ham and Egg are hanging out at their show.  The great Cream Pie Jones.  Who?  Cream Pie Jones.  He gets a little carried away today.  Starts bad-mouthing our boy Eastside Dave.  And, like the Beach Boys said, Fezzy, Dave had to shut him up and then shut him down.  David, come on in here.  First of all, way to represent. 
[02:48:00]  Very, very proud of you today.  Thank you, Mr. B.  Yeah.  Who is this kid?  Who is this guy?  Yeah, who's Cream Pie Jones?  If I had to describe him in one word, it would be chump.  Good way.  Hold on.  Let people get the laughter out of the way.  Okay.  Hey, hey, hey.  Don't laugh at Ronnie.  God damn, Ronnie.  Don't laugh at Ronnie today.  We're in the middle of duty wars.  You don't laugh.  I know.  Don't laugh.  Hold it in.  You've got to respect your adversary sometimes.  No, no, no.  Just.  That's funny.  No, no, no.  Stop laughing. 
[02:48:30]  This is serious business, these duty wars.  Basically what they were referring to, who knew it was going to go way further than it  did.  But Ronnie was complimenting Eastside Day because he kind of like pooped in on a plate and then  might have taken a taste.  Just a little, little taste.  A little, little taste.  A little taste yesterday.  And we thought that was the end of it.  How can I?  So Dave goes crazy when he learns that Cream Pie Jones is right outside the studio. 
[02:49:00]  Here it is.  You know what?  I do believe that is ONA's intern.  That's Cream Pie Jones.  Cream Pie Jones is hanging around outside or is he?  Yep.  He's right outside the door.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah, there he is right there.  Are you fucking kidding me?  There he is.  Come on.  There he is.  The blog.  Is that him?  In my fucking house.  In your house.  In my fucking house.  You're going to be in here in my fucking house.  Do you understand who you're fucking dealing with? 
[02:49:30]  I will fucking deal with your heart.  You're going to have to die.  You're going to have to die.  You are going to get fucking shit on.  I can fucking shit in your ass.  This is not a fucking joke, fucker.  This is not a real thing.  Dave.  This is not a fucking bitch.  Dave.  Dave, take his shirt.  Take his fucking shirt off him.  Take his shirt off him.  Take his shirt off him.  Take his.  There it is.  Okay. 
[02:50:00]  Dave, take your own shirt off.  All right.  Who's got Dave?  A bit gay.  Don't ever come into my house again.  Dave's shirtless.  Don't ever come into my house again.  All right.  This isn't our studio.  Don't ever come into fucking Frank's place again.  All right.  Stop laughing.  Hey, hey.  Don't laugh.  Don't let him help it.  I can't help it.  That fucking Ron Bennington.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  So Dave.  It is very funny.  Dave there confronts.  Frank's place.  Confronts Cream Pie Jones. 
[02:50:30]  And, uh, well.  Well, it gets a little ugly.  Yeah, it certainly does.  And all of a sudden, like, Eastside Dave, uh, kind of, kind of shows Cream Pie Jones what  he's made of.  Yep.  In this next clip.  Literally.  Literally.  Hold on.  You know what?  Where's the picture?  Where's the stunt that you were ready to do?  Where's this picture?  There's the picture.  Take it front and center.  I got a picture here of Cream Pie Jones.  From his mice place?  I'd like to show you what I do with that picture. 
[02:51:00]  If I could use your assistance, mister.  Thank you, sir.  Wait.  Hold on.  We have a floor here that, you know, we need.  Where is the shit pan?  Oh, he's getting his shit pan right now.  I didn't know we had an official shit pan.  Wait.  Is that?  What is it?  This is a picture of Cream Pie Jones.  Unclench those fists, Cream Pie.  Unclench those fists.  Here you go.  And you know what?  Take your time.  Grab something here, because I want ONA to have to see this. 
[02:51:30]  I want ONA to have to see the way that you're handling this right now.  Take it.  And it's taking place right in front of Cream Pie.  Here you go, Cream Pie.  I'm going to put it right on your eye.  Oh, God.  He just pissed on Cream Pie's picture.  He just pissed.  Cream Pie, come on over here.  Is that something that.  Get that fucking picture away from me, because you know what I do with the Cream Pie picture?  Oh.  What happened?  In my fucking mouth. 
[02:52:00]  In my fucking mouth.  Dave just ate the pissed on Cream Pie Jones picture.  He's drinking.  And he's drinking the leftover piss out of his chin.  He drank the leftover piss out of the pimp pan after eating.  Poe, how are you feeling?  Tough guy.  We found out what Poe is afraid of.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Dave.  Get the fuck away from my piss.  This is my shit, baby.  All right.  Get your own gimmick.  Oh, man. 
[02:52:30]  That.  Yeah, I heard that yesterday.  Yeah.  And all I could think of was, we are so beaten.  We are so beaten because there's nothing that this guy, Eastside Dave, will not do.  Well, I was thinking the same thing.  But, you know, we got Pat Duffy now.  We'll explain it in a second.  Exactly.  Pat Duffy.  We got to break out the heavy.  The Great White Hope.  Yeah, absolutely.  We realized, and we have no problem admitting it, that Eastside Dave took our guy down within 
[02:53:00]  five minutes.  Oh, it was a pummeling.  It was like an early Mike Tyson fight.  Right there, Dave won.  Right.  But he decided to go even further.  Oh, yeah.  Even further to just show where he's willing to go.  And this is what happened.  All right.  Hold on.  Dave's sitting in the corner.  Dave is shitting in the corner. 
[02:53:30]  Dave is shitting in the corner.  It's hard to keep up with all this.  Get him a fresh picture, would you please?  No picture, God damn it.  Another picture of Cream Pie Jones, please.  In case you're just tuning in, Eastside Dave had a picture printed out of Cream Pie Jones,  his nemesis from the O&A show.  He pissed on it, shoved it in his mouth, and drank the leftover piss from his piss pan. 
[02:54:00]  His piss pan.  He wanted a challenge, Dave.  He wanted a goddamn war, right?  Well, am I right?  He wanted a war.  I know he did, Dave, but I don't like the shit-eating.  Well, let's go away for that.  It really is.  I'd love a glass of water.  I like, I can't watch, I can't be part of this.  It seems like the only fair thing to get him is a glass of water.  I don't think this is healthy.  I don't think it's healthy. 
[02:54:30]  I think he's having trouble keeping his piss in.  You ready to look at your Dream Maker?  Are you ready to look at your Dream Maker?  Say you're ready!  I'm ready!  Dave just chewed up a big piece of shit.  Nice size nugget.  I threw it!  I was puking!  And he's chewing it.  I threw it up a little bit.  I think I need seconds! 
[02:55:00]  Now he's licking...  I was puking away!  Dave chewed up his own shit nugget,  and then he's licking the leftover shit off of his fingers  while Poe pukes his guts out.  See, that...  There's just a few highlights.  And then, of course,  Z-Side Dave had to kind of clean out his mouth,  and then he did a shot of palm olive,  which is basically poison if you ingest it,  so then he was in the hospital,  and he got out very late last night.  That brings us to today, 
[02:55:30]  where they hijacked our radio show.  Yes, they came busting in.  Dave on a chain,  being held by Fez Watley,  and he's just here.  He's here for a challenge.  Yeah.  He is here to show that he kicked ass yesterday,  and we look silly.  So we have bid a fond farewell to Cream Dick.  Well, no.  His name is Jared. 
[02:56:00]  He's back to just Jared,  and he did what he's supposed to be doing.  He just handed me my next cup of coffee.  He's getting coffee because he failed miserably.  And we're admitting that.  We had to go to the bullpen after just a trouncing  and pick up our own Pat Duffy.  Now, you might remember Pat Duffy.  He was the one during the eggnog drinking contest,  when Pat from Munaki emerged victorious. 
[02:56:30]  He laid down, and in order to become an intern,  he laid his head over a garbage pail,  like it was a sink at a hair salon to get your hair washed.  He was sitting in a chair,  leaning his head over a garbage pail,  and Pat from Munaki projectile vomited all over his face.  Gallons.  It can't be described.  It's on, I believe, Break.com.  Go to Break.com and throw in Baby Bird.  Baby Bird.  And you will see just volley after volley of vomit, 
[02:57:00]  like it's coming out of a fire hose,  splashing into your face.  I was stunned watching this.  And now you're going to have to do something that beats Dave?  Yes.  This, to me, I got to say.  Have some faith, Anthony.  Have some faith.  I have faith, but I lack confidence.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're talking to Pat Duffy here.  My voice is getting high. 
[02:57:30]  I know, I know.  We got Pat Duffy from the bullpen.  But I saw what Dave is capable of.  The man does not have a line.  He doesn't have boundaries.  He will do whatever it takes for his team.  Oh, boy.  See?  Playing his music and everything.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  What happened to the dog collar and leash?  You guys are out of character.  We're here to gloat.  We're here to gloat. 
[02:58:00]  We're on top of the world after yesterday.  Yeah.  Don't mess with Frank's place, huh?  You know, I heard you setting up, you know, some of the audio from the Ron and Fez show  yesterday.  Yes.  Very accurate.  Very accurate, except for one thing.  There's no such thing as a little taste of duty.  No such thing as just a little taste.  You know, I think he's got a valid point there.  It was in my teeth.  Oh, God.  In my teeth. 
[02:58:30]  And may still be there.  Did you have to floss out duty?  See, that's all I need to know.  If you're on 76th Street at one point, in broad daylight at 2.30 afternoon, throwing  up your own feces while a fucking bus of tourists look at you and take photographs, life has  gone wrong.  They're bringing back some memories to wherever they're from.  That's nice.  And here's what happened in New York.  I saw someone throwing up his own feces.  Well, I like to think of it as they got snapshots of the Hardcore King. 
[02:59:00]  That's what I like.  Hardcore King.  That puts us on top of producer stunts.  You're pissing off Pat Duffy.  Did they have a picture of me, Dave?  They just had this blank stare.  Oh.  He said, did they have a picture of me?  What?  His eyes had this blank stare.  Look at our guy.  He's got a blank stare.  And a weird beard, too.  He does have a weird beard.  You've got to give him the weird beard.  It's an Amish.  Now, come on.  Even you guys got to give him the weird beard.  It's an Amish slash Abraham Lincoln beard.  If our guy could grow a beard, it would be pretty odd.  Trust me. 
[02:59:30]  That's right.  I don't think that's a good thing.  But that's right.  Speaking of beards.  Yes.  Yeah.  You want me to call my sister?  Let's not bring personal relationships into this, man.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  It just makes it that much harder.  It's like the Civil War.  Brother against brother.  You guys are getting Patrick Duffy very, very angry.  Look at that.  We can tell.  He's eyeballing Eastside Dave.  Now, he's practically awake in here. 
[03:00:00]  Patrick has something.  This is now.  Yes.  And you are promising that this will shut down Dave.  I really don't think he'll do it.  This is something you don't think Dave will do.  But you'll do it.  You're talking to a man that ate his own shit yesterday.  True.  And by the way, we don't allow Eastside Dave to do stunts on our show.  You sit there and just watch.  Oh, man.  Wow.  It's in the rules.  Ah?  He's an eager beaver, isn't he? 
[03:00:30]  You know, Anthony, say it again, how our guy ate his own shit.  It sounds like poetry coming out of you.  You know why?  I'm not saying that to compliment your guy.  What?  I am saying it to get our guy pumped up.  Dude, he ate his own shit.  Right.  I have something better.  Fuck him.  This is our house.  Wow.  You're in my house.  This is our house.  All right.  Yeah.  Our house.  Love what you've done with the place.  Our house.  I remember this house.  Yeah.  You're a guest here.  This is our house. 
[03:01:00]  We got everyone evicted.  Sorry.  Jesus Christ.  I'm really sorry about that one.  We're going to go there, are we?  Well, you know, John Manil is convinced of it, so what the hell.  Now, you were told yesterday, or asked, to come up with something for today.  Jared called me later in the day saying, I don't know what to do.  I can't top Dave.  You have to help me.  Jared's just...  Is that the same Jared from Subway?  Yes, he should be, anyway. 
[03:01:30]  I thought he was.  It's not about Jared.  We already admitted defeat with Jared.  Jared was just...  That was a fluke.  We saw him coming up in the minors, thought he had something.  Once he got in front of the major leaguer here, it was all over very quickly.  He kind of pulled a Mark Fidrich on us.  Eastside Dave, you can understand that, right?  I love the bird.  Yeah, the bird was wonderful.  Thank you, Mr. Opie.  But he flamed out fast, didn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of happened to Cream Pie Jones yesterday.  The embarrassment of Cream Pie will just go down in history on this show. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  But, Patrick Duffy.  Yes.  I am ready.  All right.  But he's red.  I'm so curious.  Opie, do you know what he's going to do?  Oh, yeah.  And you have confidence.  Oh, yeah.  Chuck it red.  Wow.  All right.  Now, we were going to do the diarrhea of super soaker.  Right.  We were going to take a super soaker, fill it with diarrhea, and then, like how you use  turpentine, we use piss to really thin it out a little bit. 
[03:02:30]  Right.  And then just squirt him in the face, mouth, just so he's taking a bath, a bath in his own  feces.  But honestly...  That would be pretty good.  Honestly, after what we heard yesterday, we kind of have realized that's kind of hack  if you're doing duty wars.  We got to relinquish that.  Yeah.  It was a bit hack.  Wouldn't the real stunt be getting the diarrhea into the super soaker?  Not being hit with it?  That's kind of rough.  I think he'd have to do that himself, load it up. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I don't know what he's going to do.  All right, Pat.  I don't know.  People are calling you the Roger Clemens.  Wow.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things, just watching Patrick Duffy in the studio.  Goodness gracious.  Pat, what do you got for Eastside Day?  All right, so I described this idea to my brother yesterday, and he almost threw up in his mouth  just me describing it.  Just the description. 
[03:03:30]  Just the description.  He couldn't do it.  Just the description.  I understand.  All right, Dave.  All right.  He's been with his brother.  This right here is a piece of genuine golden retriever dog shit.  Okay?  Okay.  It's in a little baggie.  It's in a little baggie.  It looks like it has some grass clippings in it.  It's been in the grass for about a day.  Give it to Fezzi.  Fezzi, you know, I'll examine.  Fezzi, we want to keep this fair.  We want you to acknowledge that that's what you're looking at.  Yes.  Golden retriever.  We got to keep this fair. 
[03:04:00]  That is dog duty.  All right.  Very good.  It does look like it's been in the yard for a while.  All right.  Genuine golden retriever dog shit.  Looks delicious.  Courtesy of Bub.  Courtesy of Bub.  By the way, you're not going to see our guy go into the hospital.  Oh.  I don't have gold insurance.  All right.  There it is.  See, our guy doesn't even have health insurance.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Oh, there.  He treats himself, man. 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  This is a toothbrush.  And combine these two, and I will brush my teeth with dog shit.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Game on.  That's pretty good.  Game on.  That's pretty good.  Game on.  It's in my stomach.  That's it?  Oh, hey, hey.  I sense he's punking out.  Absolutely.  He's bringing back what he did.  We're talking a whole new ballgame.  This is the World Series. 
[03:05:00]  You might have won game one.  We're at game two now.  Oh, my goodness.  And it's easy to eat your own shit.  It's my glass comic standing, too.  Oh, oh, oh.  He's got to stick up for his man.  Oh, oh.  You know something?  This could be made even more disgusting.  How so?  I was just informed.  Uh-oh.  What?  E-Rock brought his own toothbrush.  Ah!  Now we all know.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  There are problems that E-Rock has in his mouth. 
[03:05:30]  Look, the team's working together now, man.  You guys are fucked.  That I used this morning before the show.  Ah.  It's still...  The halitosis kid?  Yeah, yeah.  You will admit, Fezzy, right?  Want to keep it fair above the table that he has really awful breath.  Oh, God, yeah.  You would think he has two asses.  His breath is hardcore.  Now, what is going to happen when you start brushing and most people spit out the toothpaste?  Will there be any swallowing?  Of course. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, wow.  We lost somebody.  This will end up...  We lost somebody over there in the darkness.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Duty wars are on, my friend.  Duty wars continue.  Duty wars continue.  Can we liquefy the duty a little bit?  Maybe with a little...  Just a little water.  Maybe you put water in the bag and swish it around a little bit.  Go in the bathroom.  Just a little.  Why water?  Why not something that comes out of a human to maybe...  My original idea was to brush my teeth with shit and rinse my mouth out with piss. 
[03:06:30]  Wow, wow.  I got some dignity.  What were your parents' original ideas?  My dad's listening right now.  Wow.  I told my mom.  Yeah, listen.  A little water...  Make like a paste out of it.  Just paste, though.  Like a...  Yeah.  Not a soup.  We want paste.  Yeah, sure.  If you need to dilute your poop, huh, Dave?  No, no, no.  That's easy.  Purely so it adheres to the brush better.  Look, this is purely for...  And smears on his teeth.  This is purely for the video.  It's like a reactivator.  Unlike you guys, we know how to make videos so people can see this and enjoy it over and 
[03:07:00]  over again.  What the hell's a video?  What the hell's a video?  Video?  Okay, it's a cup.  The duty is going to go in a cup with a little bit of water.  Just the water.  All right.  Fez, you want to like a super party?  Very little bit.  Very little bit of water.  That's it.  All right.  It's just got to make a little paste out of it.  All right.  I'm going to push it down.  Just enough water to loosen it up.  There goes the golden retriever.  Oh, cool. 
[03:07:30]  That had a thud.  Oh, God.  Into the cup.  Oh, now mush it up into a nice pasty consistency.  Does it stink really bad, Iraq?  Yeah.  Wait, let me see.  Maybe we ought to keep it in the bathroom.  It's very sour.  Don't bring that towards me.  I swear I'll kill you.  Whoa.  You're going to have to do that.  Patrick Duffy.  Patrick Duffy.  Don't move any further, Patrick Duffy.  I smelled it.  Fezzy.  Got to keep it fair.  You got to smell it.  Do it over by Iraq.  I'll give it a whiff.  Fezzy's got to smell, too.  We got to keep it fair.  Got to make sure. 
[03:08:00]  Use Iraq's mic.  We want to make sure everyone understand.  There's no trickery today.  Oh.  Does your retriever have cancer?  Oh, boy.  Dave, would you like to maybe smell that?  No, no, no.  I'd love to.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Why?  What's wrong?  He's not sabotaging us today.  I understand this man more than you think.  Oh, he'll probably grab it and drink the whole thing down and go, yeah, I just. 
[03:08:30]  And by the way, this has.  What are you going to do?  Were you planning on that?  Yes.  Oh, motherfucker.  And by the way, this has nothing to do with the surprise I have for you personally.  Okay.  Wow.  It should be a check, Dave.  I want you living in fear.  Birthday card?  A large check.  Thank you.  I will finally acknowledge that you're married.  How's that?  Oh.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's.  What do we got going?  Where is the lovely.  There she is.  All right.  What do we got there?  The lovely.  You ready to go?  Let me see it again. 
[03:09:00]  It's my apartment, too, Mr. Anthony.  Look how pretty.  Oh, it looks like chocolate rain.  Oh, just look from here.  No.  Look.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, Richard's puking.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, fuck.  It stinks.  Okay.  All right.  Get a garbage pill.  Get a garbage pill.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:09:30]  That stinks real bad.  Should we do this in the bathroom or what?  Or do it right here?  Do it in front of Anthony.  Fuck you.  Get away from me.  I don't like shit wars.  It's collateral.  That's when.  I'm a refugee in a shit war.  I don't know where to go.  Oh, here it is.  All right.  Well.  I'm not doing this good.  All right.  E-Rock is now handing over his smell.  Can I smell your toothbrush?  Oh, God damn it.  You're a glutton for punishment.  Well, I want to. 
[03:10:00]  Bessie, if you will.  Sure.  Trying to keep it fair.  Want me to put it behind my bad ear?  Oh, fuck.  I can put some bad ear.  Good guy.  Do it.  Does E-Rock have cancer?  That is brutal.  Wait, wait, wait.  Eastside, we got something.  You've never smelled what's behind, what's your name?  Rich Voss.  Oh, Rich Voss.  Rich Voss's ear?  No, I have never smelled that.  Hold on.  He has a cyst, and it kind of leaks this goo.  It kind of smells like grape jelly if you kind of let it rot. 
[03:10:30]  And this smell has taken men down.  Oh, here you go.  People have passed out smelling this.  People have puked because of this.  That's a good one.  Oh!  Holy fucking shit!  I think Voss should be in this competition.  At least it's here.  Fuck Pat Duffy.  Oh, yeah!  He's like saying he just took a couple jabs to the face. 
[03:11:00]  What did it smell like?  I'm still standing.  It smelled like fucking demon shit.  You took a couple jabs right to the noggin, my friend.  That was a good one, huh?  Don't mess with us.  I've seen many people puke doing exactly what you did, and I've seen people hit the ground.  Yep.  Is it still smelling?  Yeah, I can put it on the toothbrush if you want.  No, have Pat Duffy smell it.  Pat, just smell it.  That's not so bad.  Oh.  I think it's got a very quick half-life.  Don't get the fuck away from me.  Get the fuck away from me. 
[03:11:30]  I don't play that shit.  What is that exactly?  That's ear wax?  No, it's from behind.  It's the ear oil.  He has a cyst behind his ear, and it leaks this goopy, pussy shit.  Like the Valdez.  You still got more on there?  I know, right?  Yeah, there's still enough to put on a toothbrush.  No, no, dig more.  I kind of like the Eastside Dave reaction.  I don't know if I had that much left.  It's running out.  All right, let's...  It's almost running out.  Okay, hold on. 
[03:12:00]  Let me...  Give me that finger.  I don't suck your fucking finger.  He literally...  I just fucking suck your fucking finger.  Yes, he did.  Let me go down on your finger.  Oh, yes, he did.  Give me your fucking finger.  Let me go down on it like a man.  Oh, God.  He sucked the finger that he...  What the hell?  Oh, God.  He's going to puke.  Oh, he's puking, though.  He's puking.  Look, watch it. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, God.  Damn.  Oh, you're not as cocky now, huh, sir?  Keep it together, Mad Dog.  Oh, my God.  That is fucking sick.  Were you doing a little rope-a-dope there?  He grabbed Voss's finger and sucked it.  That is the disgusting ear finger.  Will I ever have clean breath again?  Thank you, B4.  Shit, piss, Voss's finger.  All right.  How does the beautiful Casey kiss you like that? 
[03:13:00]  There wasn't any last night.  No, huh?  No kissing?  No.  Sorry to hear that.  Pat Duffy's girlfriend is in studio now, too, so...  I'm about to brush my teeth with dog shit.  Do you want to make out?  All right.  All right.  Do you want to make out or...?  Yeah, tongue and everything.  Oh.  Yeah.  With dog shit.  Here's the toothbrush.  All right.  Here we go.  And...  Voss rubbed this behind his ear or what?  No, there's nothing left.  Nothing left.  Nothing left.  Fuck balls. 
[03:13:30]  Now he's scooping up a nice big heap and helping.  Did you practice this at all?  Hey, Sam, get this on camera.  No.  Did you practice this at all?  Oh, boy, God.  Shit.  All right.  No.  Is that actually on the...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wait, what are we looking at?  It's very straight.  It's like...  It's dog shit that's been out in the yard with a couple grass clippings in it.  Perhaps a dung beetle or two.  There's no way he's doing this.  Oh, shit.  No way.  He licked the hands already over at Garment Trail.  Ready? 
[03:14:00]  Well, look right at each side, Dave.  Fuck you, Dave.  Bring it.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, he's brushing his teeth with dog shit.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God damn, though.  Get the moles.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Get the brushing on, Mike.  Get the brushing on, Mike. 
[03:14:30]  What do you think, Rich?  Why are you over there, man?  I'm puking from here.  Oh, God.  How's that taste?  Anything?  You want me to brush my teeth?  No.  You can do whatever you want on your show.  Okay.  Wow.  He just brushed his teeth with dog shit from the yard.  Oh, my God. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, man.  How did we get to this point?  The escalation.  The escalation this war is taking.  No one wins the duty war.  No.  Only on radio.  Duty.  It feels like sand in my mouth.  Next week on Two and a Half Men.  Yeah.  Duty wars.  Oh.  He's the real deal, Dave.  I'll give Pat Duffy a minimum amount of credit for at least putting the duty in his mouth  and trying to make his teeth hygienic with it.  But in the end, duty on the teeth or duty in the stomach? 
[03:15:30]  Nah, you swallow it and it's gone.  He, he, he, you ate that duty?  This is the gift that keeps on giving.  He's somewhat at my level now.  But.  Somewhat.  You heard that.  You heard that.  You heard that.  Somewhat.  You want to do the staple thing just as a goof?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You got to be impressed, Fezzy.  Let's not lie here.  I think I won.  Won?  Won!  Yes!  I said, hey, duty for duty, this guy ate shit. 
[03:16:00]  We have a new leader.  Let me tell you something else, too.  I mean, yes, Patrick Duffy now has a winning smile.  But it, it was your own shit, Dave.  I think that makes it more, human shit is about 30 times more disease than dog shit.  But it's your shit.  Yeah, Dave.  This is a dog.  You got a number two in you?  It's an animal shit.  Yeah.  I don't have, I don't think I have a number two in me.  Yeah.  In years.  Yeah, Dave.  This is a dog's shit.  That's right. 
[03:16:30]  You know, you ate whatever it was.  It was your body chemicals that broke it down to the point that it was shit, but it was  your shit.  It came out of your asshole.  Right.  This came out of a dog.  Dogs are so small and delightful.  I can eat dog shit and snacks.  Delightful.  We all acknowledge how gross that piece of shit was, though.  That was from a Great Dane, too.  Yeah.  Golden Retriever.  Oh, whatever.  Golden Retriever.  You want to staple your nutsack to your leg?  Sure.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  I got it all over here already. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  And this is just him kind of warming up.  I read on FBA last night that Duffy is ONA's only hope against Seaside, Dave.  It really is.  It really is.  You made people forget about Cream Pie Jones today.  That's all I know.  Wow.  Yeah, who?  And by not allowing Dave to do anything on our show, we're the winners for the next  couple hours.  For a while, maybe.  Oh, boy.  Makes us feel good.  But I doubt it.  Oh, boy. 
[03:17:30]  So now you're going to staple your nutsack.  Sure.  To your leg.  Well, Dave has no tolerance for pain, so I know he won't do that.  That is true.  You are a screamer.  I like to scream to symbolize the pain that I'm going through.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Sure.  Yeah, but a simple whack on your ass, and you're screaming like a girl.  Mick Foley screams when he falls off through the hell of a cell.  Remember?  What?  When he was in the studio getting spanked was by me.  That's true.  That's true.  Yes, you and the big man spanking the naked guy's ass.  Yes. 
[03:18:00]  Hurrah.  I'm emotional.  I'm expressive.  Is that it?  That's all I'm doing.  I'm emoting things.  We're at a good place right now.  I'm feeling good.  I'm feeling a lot better than I did.  I'm feeling good with our guy.  Thank God we went to the bullpen today.  I am feeling so much better.  Yes.  He's shooting dope somewhere going, I was somebody a day ago.  He got us coffee.  By the way, we have done a lot of things for the PalTalk audience in the past. 
[03:18:30]  We have 600 people in the room.  That's it?  Watching this.  Should be more.  Well, you know something?  PalTalk community, very limited.  They're an elite group.  Yeah.  Day-to-day basis, you're pretty good with 200, 250 people.  600 people in here.  600 people.  Watching shit.  No.  Watching someone brush their teeth.  Watching our guy.  Right.  Our guy.  Right.  All right.  There goes Duffy washing it down a little bit. 
[03:19:00]  What does it taste like?  Shit.  What does shit taste like?  Chicken.  A little tangy.  Gritty.  Gritty.  It tastes like it smells.  If that makes any sense.  But Ants, that's a brilliant question.  Because you always say, what does it taste like?  Shit.  But none of us really know what shit tastes like.  Dave, would you like to maybe...  More in this room, though.  Right.  What does your shit taste like?  I would say cupcakes...  ...and broken dreams from the anus of a retarded person. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  That's a good way to put it, I guess.  That's the way I see it anyway, Mr. Anthony.  Look at Casey.  Dave, stay strong.  I have faith.  She does.  Dave is strong.  Dave ingested crap yesterday.  Not just rubbing around his mouth.  At this point, that's a distant memory.  Shit.  Piss.  Paper.  And soap.  Don't forget the paper.  When your wife got the call that you were in the hospital, she goes, did he eat shit again? 
[03:20:00]  Again.  All right.  I like this.  Yeah.  We're in a good place.  Game on.  Game on.  All right.  How do you follow?  Stapler?  There he goes.  Well, this is how you follow it.  Oh, Christ.  Here he goes.  Good thing I wore clean underwear.  We're not just a unit, I hope.  I have no idea how he's going to do this.  Can I hold my clothes?  What's that?  No.  Oh, he's getting his girlfriend over there.  That's his lovely girlfriend.  I would have to say X.  Yeah.  Wait, could you guys kiss really fast? 
[03:20:30]  Oh, Christ.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  All right.  That's pretty fucking good.  On her part.  Yeah.  She's not in this fucking competition.  That was a team effort.  That was the halftime show.  You relax.  That was one.  All right, Pat.  Here's my balls and stuff.  My balls and stuff.  Holy fuck.  He's not circumcised. 
[03:21:00]  It's very cold in here.  Oh, come on.  That is disgusting.  Oh!  Oh, fuck.  He just stapled.  No, he's pissed off because he can't get it stuck to his leg.  What, you got a steel scrotum?  I'm telling you, man.  I was using a little piece of paper.  We got to stabilize it.  We found our man.  Oh, what's wrong with him? 
[03:21:30]  Jesus.  Right now, some woman in the secretarial pool is going, where's my stapler?  Oh, God damn.  Jesus.  I don't know.  It says, E-side Dave sucks at life.  Yeah.  It has now stapled that paper to his yam bag.  He's stapled his balls to his leg.  Pat Iron Nuts Duffy, they're calling him now. 
[03:22:00]  A lot of new names coming out.  Oh, Duffy is.  There's a lot of Duffy chants on pal talk right now.  Is your balls bleeding?  Does it start to bleed from now?  It's starting to sting a little.  Duffy don't puke.  Oh, I don't puke.  Well played.  He's trying to pull out the staples.  Does he?  Old leather sack.  Should we get him a staple remover?  You're impressed, aren't you?  Oh.  A little bit, right?  A little bit.  Wow, look at it.  The kid's got gumption. 
[03:22:30]  He's an up-and-comer.  He's no E-side Dave.  I find the uncircumcised cock more disgusting.  Are you more of a clipped man yourself?  I absolutely am.  That looked like a terrorist.  His cock looked...  Mohammed Atta cock.  It's on the no-fly list.  Looked like an anteater.  Looking for some ants there.  All right.  Well, uh...  I think I won.  I...  I...  Yeah.  The slow clap.  Oh.  Keep it slower. 
[03:23:00]  I think he, uh...  Showed his worthiness and his dedication to the Opie and Anthony show.  Stop me!  In challenging Eastside Dave.  Brushing his teeth with dog shit.  Stapling his, uh...  Ball bag.  Just a wonderful day for sport.  That's right.  This battle has taken on a whole new life.  To be continued.  We finally have a brave warrior in our midst.  I don't want to do so long. 
[03:23:30]  Patrick Duffy.  And, uh, Duffy?  Yes?  You are working on other stunts, right?  Don't underestimate this kid.  Yeah.  Don't underestimate him.  Always remember that he has no fear.  That's right.  Eastside Dave has no fear.  But you, my friend...  I have no fear as well.  I know you...  You can...  You can battle him.  You can battle him.  The war has just begun!  Oh, jeez, Dave.  That's why this kid here, Eastside Dave, is on the top of his game. 
[03:24:00]  Does he not?  He doesn't have a stop button.  Not the same energy as he had on the Ron and Fez show.  He doesn't have...  Just begun!  No.  Just begun!  He doesn't have a stop button.  Just ask the fine folks at Palmolive.  At this point, I have one thing to say.  What is he doing?  He's taking his shoe off.  Oh, he's beating himself over the head with his own shoe.  Just begun!  Yeah, that's impressive.  Easy, mad dog!  Holy Jesus, he's crazy. 
[03:24:30]  Eastside Dave will answer each and every challenge as it comes along.  Oh, boy, chewing the shoe, yeah.  Oh, he's eating his own shoe.  He is crazy.  Yeah, you're crazy.  You gotta give him that.  We'll give you that.  What was that?  You wouldn't let him near the poop paste.  What was that?  Look at that.  Oh!  Now he's just stapling his head.  Eastside Dave is stapling paper to his face.  And it says Eastside Dave loves the cock.  Loves the cock.  And he has stapled it to his face.  Yeah, so...  Oh!  And, you know... 
[03:25:00]  Wow, okay.  These guys are just out for blood now.  Yeah.  Pat Duffy, by the way.  By the way, I have just one other thing to say.  Get out of our house!  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Get the fuck out of our house!  The real stunts happen in Frank's place.  Goodbye!  We all know that.  Go back to your closet.  Bye-bye!  We all know it. 
[03:25:30]  The champ leaves victorious.  Yeah, yeah, sure you do.  Goodbye!  Get out!  Well, there goes Eastside Dave.  Let me just say one thing.  Yeah.  This interview is over.  Oh, shit!  That's it.  There they go.  Hit our music!  Leaving and...  Hit our music!  Leaving in defeat, mind you.  Get out!  In defeat!  With more resolve than ever!  Oh!  You better go before your music ends. 
[03:26:00]  You'll look pretty silly standing there in silence.  Good point!  Goodbye, Fez.  There they go.  Goodbye!  Fez Watley and Eastside Dave.  They came to look at a true champion, a true warrior in Patrick Duffy.  I didn't think he had it in him.  And now he does.  Dog shit.  He should be like Caesar now.  Duffy.  Brushing his teeth with dog shit!  And swallowing it.  Beat that!  Beat that!  And then stapling papers to his ball bag and face.  Oh, by the way, there was some swallowing. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  You said there would be swallowing involved.  He swallowed the dog shit.  Kind of like, I think that trumps Eastside Dave swallowing.  Yeah.  Because it's dog shit.  It's dog shit.  I just swallowed the shit of another species.  His girlfriend's standing there going, what a catch.  There's only one other thing to do.  Chocolate rain!  Chocolate rain!  Reh!  Reh!  Reh!  Oh, chocolate rain!  All right.  Do you want to have a bad breath contest?  Ha ha ha!  Hey, come on.  You got a little win under your belt there, Duffy. 
[03:27:00]  Don't go for a loss right now.  And are you working on some other things?  Sure.  Because I know this isn't over.  No, it's far from over.  We can't get cocky.  We can't get cocky at this point.  Cocky.  We can't get cocky.  Doody.  This is the worst of the Opie Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Yeah, this is Jim Norton.  Doody, doody.  Most of the time, he doesn't give a shit about you and your stupid problems.  Keep calling up paychecks.  Most of the time.  But for one hour every week, Jim Norton cares. 
[03:27:30]  When we have a third, you just smell her back.  Well, why don't you offer to take a shower with him, and then maybe she'll get the hint  when you spend 55 minutes, you know, soaping out her vagina.  If you've got problems on a phone, listen to the Jim Norton Show, Wednesday at 10 a.m.  Eastern, 7 Pacific, on the Opie Anthony channel.

Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story  never before told on the screen.  That's right.  My baby is black from 1961.  We don't know much about this film.  Some kind of, uh, exploitation film, I guess. 
[03:32:30]  I think, but then I think they take it the other way.  I'm not sure.  It's, uh, it's back in the days where, uh, you know, I think, uh, racial insensitivity  was running rampant.  Right, right.  So, yeah, it could be one of those, uh, little exploitation movies.  Teaching people, um, what?  Not to hook up with people of other, uh, backgrounds.  Teaching people about...  Stay with your own kind.  And also teaching people about blacks in general.  Yeah.  For example, this next clip, uh, class watching an educational film. 
[03:33:00]  Social workers talk about, uh, uh, uh,  civilizing black kids.  All right.  We're gonna play the new clips for the, the hardcore listeners  that have heard the first few here.  But we gotta get everyone up to speed.  So hang in there.  Hello there.  Hello, Bon Bon.  They're like puppies.  You train them with candy.  Yeah.  What can you do?  Well, more polite to strangers than to us.  And we do everything for them.  Quite discouraging.  How long have you been in social work? 
[03:33:30]  Not long enough to understand them.  Not even a smile from Rouge Mall.  Not a bit of gratitude.  You try to help civilize them.  You give them decent houses so they can live like people, not animals.  Oh.  Give them real houses and they make pig sties out of them.  They live with their lice and their dirt.  No.  Believe me, mister, I know them well.  I've tried everything.  Threats and kindness.  Nothing works against their stubbornness, their laziness.  Besides, they're sneaky and liars. 
[03:34:00]  Miserable.  They should be isolated and disinfected, too.  Believe me, sir.  Discipline is important.  A strong hand would do them much good.  I heard that conversation over my fence just yesterday.  Wow.  You have to disinfect them, too.  You give them houses.  Where the hell, wouldn't they just pull one out of the jungle somewhere?  And a strong hand does a lot of good? 
[03:34:30]  That's right.  Smack them around a little bit.  They had the greatest racist white lady voices in those days.  Oh, yeah.  Who is that woman?  I want to know.  Oh.  She was just despicable with that voice of hers.  She could have easily been on Leave it to Beaver.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Just change her dialogue around.  It's the same lady.  It's almost like when she's talking, she's speaking from the essence of the way blacks  were treated.  That's how all white people talk back then, it seems.  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  People just talk in very clipped tones.  And you just knew if you had melanin, you were finished.  Oh, well, let me tell you.  I believe that they should be kept in one area and not mingle with the rest of the white  people.  Yeah.  They kind of, they had no idea how to talk on film or tape or anything.  I'm sure they talk normally.  Did they just talk like this?  Kind of just, hey, how you doing?  In real life.  And then a microphone gets a problem.  All right.  In three, two, one.  We're rolling.  I don't believe they should ever have children with white people. 
[03:35:30]  Have a lucky strike cigarette, won't you?  They're wonderful.  Smooth and cool on the throat.  Cut.  Very good.  How was that?  Good?  Yeah, that was good.  Well, we should try it again.  No, let's try one more.  No, I got a black chick I got to go out with.  All right.  Next clip.  Professor discusses film during talk about color lecture.  Talk about color.  Unfortunate.  But that's the way most people think today.  Sounds like Plan 9 from Outer Space. 
[03:36:00]  The Negro.  Oh, yeah.  This is the.  African.  The Negro.  I forgot about this.  The Negro.  African.  So I guess the professor, I guess they were playing that film that you heard with the  lady doing the weird voice.  And then the professor comes on to discuss what they just saw.  How ridiculous it is.  I think they were trying to get a little racial sensitivity here.  So the professor explained how ridiculous this was.  This woman has maybe a couple of issues that need to be addressed. 
[03:36:30]  You know what?  It's that old gag, though.  Get the professor to show how ridiculous it is.  Yeah.  So you could actually show this exploitation to people.  Yeah.  It's kind of like the modern day talk show.  Like Maury.  It's like it's still a freak show, but you get the expert on to make it all good.  And it's legit.  Legit.  Right.  Right.  Unfortunate.  But that's the way most people think today.  For them, the African, the Negro, can never be anything but inferior. 
[03:37:00]  It is useless to tell these people otherwise.  Is this the philosophy lecture?  No.  It's to talk about color.  We have just seen a story on the Arab, who is a white man. 
[03:37:30]  Comprehend me.  Practically speaking, we could equally well have used any racial minority as victims.  The yellow race, for example.  The yellow peril.  Unfortunately, racism is a leper, gaining more ground every day, and as such, should be dealt  with seriously and intelligently.  Is any one race on Earth superior?  This guy is really full of doom and gloom.  He really is.  It's growing as a leper. 
[03:38:00]  Growing every day.  Oof.  He is a creep.  What a ghoul.  How about putting a positive spin on it, fella?  Yeah.  Times they are a-changing.  Jesus.  This is the 60s, man.  Chill out.  Come on.  Some good things are about to happen.  What a killjoy.  No kidding.  The yellow peril.  Probably goes home and talks to his kids like that, about their homework.  It's like holding a 20-year grudge. 
[03:38:30]  The yellow peril.  The yellow peril.  The Asians.  The Japs.  And he likes the Arabs.  Yeah.  They're white people.  Are they?  They wait.  Wait a few years, they're pally.  Wait till you see what they turn into.  The new Negroes.  The Arab.  The new Negroes.  A savage who will strap dynamite to his body and blow up innocent people. 
[03:39:00]  We have time for one more before the break here.  Oh, if we only do one, we'll never get back to it.  No, I promise.  We have to do it today.  The yellow peril.  They put MSG in your food and you wind up sitting so long, you get up, there's that ring on the back of your legs.  Oh, yeah, this is the other one that we've played and then we'll get to all the new clips after the break.  White friend asked black man about shaving.  Oh, right. 
[03:39:30]  Why, a black man shaves differently than a white man?  Apparently they get to something called razor bumps.  Yes, girl.  I'll tell you.  Oh, good morning.  Good morning.  I wonder why you shave like that.  You don't have any more.  I wonder why you shave like that.  Why do you shave like that?  It's once again, the camera turns on.  Yeah.  Why do you shave like that?  I wonder.  I am Rock Quarry.  That's right.  We thought this guy sounded like Rock Quarry from the Flintstones. 
[03:40:00]  You might remember me from the gunfight at the OK Rock Corral.  Pow, pow, pow.  I am Rock Quarry.  Ah.  That is from my movie, Dr. Jekyll's Hyde.  Ah.  I'll just be Gus Schultz, gas station attendant.  Hmm.  I miss Holly Rock.  My fans, the adulation.  That's the same voice.  Why do you shave like that? 
[03:40:30]  You're a Negro.  Ah, good morning.  Good morning.  I wonder why you shave like that.  You don't have any more beard than a hen's egg.  Right.  It's a stupid habit.  Why do you say that?  Because, anyway, I prefer looking like this to looking like, to looking like the good Negro.  Which one is that?  Well, the one who shines shoes.  The one who is always so polite.  The one who always says thank you whenever he gets his tips. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, boy.  This, this one's a bit, uh...  He's, um, a little, uh, advanced.  He's a little, you know...  This one might have to be...  It's 1961, for God's sake.  He certainly has some advanced thinking, doesn't he?  Harumph, harumph.  I don't want to be like the good Negro.  All right. 
[03:41:30]  On the way.  They all talk like Master Poe.  Gentlemen, why do you shave like that?  Let's get back to my baby is black.  Yeah, right back into it.  Where, where did we leave, uh, the folks at?  Uh, we left off with the shaving.  Okay.  And, um, the black guy wanted to shave.  Well, he didn't want to look like, uh, like a shoeshine black.  Yeah, yeah.  He wanted to look like a businessman black.  Upwardly mobile.  And he, uh, he understands that people make opinions real fast just on the, because of the color of his skin. 
[03:42:00]  So he figured he could help, help that along a little bit if he kept clean-shaven at all times.  He didn't want an Uncle Remus beard.  Right, right, right.  Well, I can't wait to hear the rest.  Interracial love has to overcome barriers.  That's what I want to hear.  From 1961, this is My Baby is Black.  Do you still love me?  I love you very much, Francis.  But we must consider the facts.  We must not forget that wherever we may go, people will stare and point their fingers at you. 
[03:42:30]  Perhaps your good friends will desert you.  And they may also...  Perhaps.  She's got to be the white one, right?  Yeah, she's the white woman.  She's got to be the white one.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Is that a black boyfriend talking to her?  Trouble brewing.  It might be.  What?  He's not, like, shucking and jiving or nothing.  Who's that talking to?  Is that her black boyfriend or is that her father?  I'm assuming the guy's black.  She's white.  He's saying that your friends may leave you.  Yeah.  Eric saw it.  Eric?  Mike? 
[03:43:00]  Yes.  White girlfriend, black boyfriend.  Okay, he's talking to her.  And that's the black guy talking to her?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, just telling her what to expect.  What to expect.  It's going to be a treat.  All right.  Do you still love me?  I love you very much, Francis.  But we must consider the facts.  We must not forget that wherever we may go, people will stare and point their fingers at you.  Perhaps your good friends will desert you, and they may also smirk and hide behind their masks when they see you coming. 
[03:43:30]  I don't want to think of that.  Only our love.  I love you very much.  But I must not forget it.  It is my responsibility.  If you love me as you are constantly telling me, you must think of it.  How it will affect your future and your whole life.  You must conquer your parents and many, many other prejudices and my skin.  And catch the thrilling sequel, My Daughter is a F***ing Lover. 
[03:44:00]  In movies soon.  See this f***ing ravage a white girl.  In Technicolored.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That guy painted a bleak little picture, didn't he?  No kidding.  A mere, what, 46 years later, we might vote for a black president.  It's going to be awful. 
[03:44:30]  People will point and stare.  Your family and friends will abandon you.  It's going to be horrible.  They'll turn their backs on you.  But you're going to get some of the biggest f*** you've ever gotten in your life.  Oh, it's not much of a sacrifice.  I love you.  Do ya?  Could anybody act back then?  Yes.  No.  It's like an awful soap opera.  Isn't it just horrid?  Thank God for Brando, or they don't still be talking like this. 
[03:45:00]  Like that.  Rachel.  Rachel.  You've married a s***.  My string of peloponies.  My s***.  Oh, God.  Is that funny?  All right.  Mr. Faber-Sham, my daughter will not go out with a s***.  Will not go out with a s***.  No, this is an audio of All the Way May. 
[03:45:30]  Ah!  Rick in Canada.  Hope he's a great aunt.  All the Way May.  All right.  Enough about All the Way May.  No, there's never enough.  Never.  Here we go.  Well, this fine couple, they go on a date to a jazz club.  Oh, okay.  So, he took her to the black place.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:46:00]  Well, it is the early 60s.  It's a little safer.  And, well, black musicians are human beings, is what we learn in this clip.  Oh.  From My Baby is Black, 1961.  Of course.  Isn't it strange?  I've never noticed it about the musicians.  What's that?  The black musicians.  I've never thought of them as being people.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  What the hell did she think?  Oh, my God.  She must really like the, you know what, man. 
[03:46:30]  I never thought of them as people.  As people?  Just like flute playing animals or saxophone playing creatures?  Wax figures?  What are they?  They're not people.  And she's dating one.  She thought she was going to walk into the Star Wars bar.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police. 
[03:47:00]  Being people with a past, future problems as human beings.  That's right.  You see them as machines turn out pleasure to make you dance and laugh and sing, to give  you a merry time.  You know, when people go home, they forget all about them, the Negroes.  Not one person thinks about how a Negro lives or dies. 
[03:47:30]  Sorry, honey.  We have to turn around.  I think I forgot to shut off the...  Dear, did you leave the...  on?  A machine.  What the hell is...  They think of us as machines.  I've got to take my...  down to the shop.  I think he's broken.  He's leaking oil. 
[03:48:00]  Make your own oil jokes, people, please.  I mean...  We'll leave it at that.  When there's music playing, don't jump up and down, or the...  skip.  Wow.  My goodness, is that a 1959...  That's wonderful.  I own a 48, and it runs like... 
[03:48:30]  I put it in first, and it's lazy and shiftless.  I can't shift into second.  See, it's shiftless, because it's a...  It's...  Machines.  Machines.  Damn you, machines.  Take your filthy claws off me, you damn dirty machine.  Machines.  Machines. 
[03:49:00]  I swear, I've never heard that one before.  Ever.  Is there a time in American history where we just thought of the black man as a machine?  Well, okay.  Maybe during the slave days.  No, they were replaced by the contingent.  Thank you, Eli Whitney.  Wow, this is...  More, more.  I need more.  All right.  Well, of course, they went on a date to the jazz club. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Next step.  She's pregnant.  Oh, boy.  The white girl is pregnant.  One night at the jazz club.  By the Negro.  Right.  This is trouble.  What have we done for God to inflict such punishment on us?  That's the parents?  That's the parents?  Yeah, the parents freak out discovering daughter's pregnancy.  Should have set up the clip a little better here.  Here's Papa.  What have we done for God to inflict such punishment on us?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God in heaven.  My daughter pregnant by an... 
[03:50:00]  What will people think?  Whoa, what...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That wasn't Anthony's beep.  That wasn't even my beep.  Wow, did she really say it?  Yeah, we had to beep it out.  She said the word?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  She didn't say Negro.  Negro.  Oh, God.  I want to hear the...  We got to play that.  I want to hear the June Allison saying that.  Yeah.  After our discussion yesterday, we're allowed to play it.  Yeah.  It's a historic piece of footage.  It is historic. 
[03:50:30]  All right, hold on.  I'm going to try it.  Give it a whirl.  Let's see what Al does with this.  It's fine.  What do you think, Al?  I think it is.  Oh, you're not doing this.  It's historical footage from a motion picture that shows how horrible this was back then.  How racist they were back in 1960.  And actually, this is a movie that is showing how bad it is.  It's not like showing this as being good in a good light.  Showing this is bad. 
[03:51:00]  This is where we test what this radio show could do.  See what this could do.  See if we got anything accomplished yesterday with the lawyers.  Here we go.  That same clip unedited.  What have we done for God to inflict such punishment on us?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God in heaven.  My daughter pregnant by a nigger.  What will people think?  We must get rid of it.  Father, how can you think about a thing like that?  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut. 
[03:51:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I like Mom.  She's got spunk.  Oh, wow.  Mom's a firecracker.  Wow.  Look out for Mom.  Dirty, dirty, low-down slut.  Low-down slut.  She's the greatest.  Wow.  And Al didn't dump, right?  No.  I want her to be my mom.  All right, we did get something accomplished yesterday.  Say thank you.  All right, I changed my job.  I want to thank the station.  Yeah.  And the powers that be. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  See?  See, the world didn't blow up.  Yeah.  Let's all count down.  This is, uh...  Wow, this is fascinating.  Oh, I got to hear her again.  I backed it up a little bit.  Father, how can you think about a thing like that?  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  That's a sin.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  The child that a nigger put in you is a stain.  There is no religion when one lives with niggers.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus. 
[03:52:30]  The family is not taking it well.  No.  Wow.  You could absolutely say this family is a tad intolerant as to this girl's plight.  Wow.  That could be the greatest clip we've played in the last eight months.  That is unbelievable.  Oh, my God.  A stain.  I doubt the mother's going to be holding the baby shower. 
[03:53:00]  Wow.  I don't think that's going to be happening.  They have the same cadence in Rosemary's baby when they were talking to her.  Satan is his father.  It's just horrid acting and...  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I want to see this video.  Wash away that terrible stain.  Oof.  It's better than I thought it would be.  Yeah.  All the way...  Was the waiting worth it? 
[03:53:30]  See?  I say yes.  I say yes, too.  The big tease for a week, you bastard.  All right.  Let's go to the next clip here.  It's going to get a little ugly from here on in.  What?  What has it been so far?  The Rainbow Coalition?  Yeah.  The Hoover.  Jesus.  That mom.  That mom.  Oh, wow.  She must be great at the Mahjong sessions.  Let me tell you a little bit about my daughter, the slut. 
[03:54:00]  The dirty, low-down slut.  It's interesting to see where their line was back then.  Because you'd think of moms just as, like, bakers.  That's all she did.  And wearing dresses all the time in the house.  She said that with an apple pie in one hand.  Right, right, right, right.  And, like, an egg-stirring whisk in the other.  Right.  A black eye from what she said to her husband the day before.  All we know is they had to wear dresses, bake a lot, and get the cocktail ready for their man when he got home from work. 
[03:54:30]  But, man, you push her.  You push her.  Dad's wearing a suit.  Dad always wore a suit in those days, and Mom had the perfect bouffant hairdo.  Yeah, the bouffant hair.  Gee, beef.  Eddie Haskell's mom's a little mad that, well, daughter's going out with a...  That's what I picture.  Just June Cleaver.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do we have time for the next clip, or should we take a break here?  Oh, boy. 
[03:55:00]  We're going to have to break?  Yeah, we're running a little late.  All right.  We really are running a little late.  Let's say hi to John in Queens.  John, what's up?  Running a little late, just like the...  John, what's up?  Is your Negro running?  Well, you better go catch it.  No, it's a refrigerator joke, you idiot.  You know, they're not machines.  They play jazz, and jazz music makes you pregnant.  Remember, stay away from the clarinet. 
[03:55:30]  It's the music.  It's big, long, and black.  It's the music of the devil.  All right, Dave in Texas.  Oh, boy.  Nothing good could come out of Texas.  Oh, no.  As we discussed this.  Oh, no.  I think the parents are being too liberal.  I want to say hi to Dallas this morning.  What's up, Dallas?  All right, Dave.  What's up, boy?  Why the welcome with open arms from the mother?  What do you got?  You're running.  That's hilarious.  Hey, I'm married to a white woman.  I've been married to her for five years.  Yeah.  And I notice every time I come around the corner, I mean, I'll come home early from work, 
[03:56:00]  and she'll jump like just somebody broke into an apartment.  Phil, and you're married to a white woman?  You're married five years?  And her mom is staying with us this week, and she does the exact same thing.  Are you immune to mace?  It just builds up an immunity, gets it sprayed in its face every night.  You know what you ought to do?  You ought to whistle when you walk in the door so they kind of hear it, and they're prepared.  Maybe it's just the shock of seeing a person.  Or do you come around, like, hands first?  Yeah, that's hilarious.  You racist.  Hey, I love you, boys.  Hey, Dave, what about her parents? 
[03:56:30]  They're cool with you, or what?  When I first was ready to propose, her dad just, he liked me as a friend,  but not as a black guy going to be banging his little princess.  Oh, yeah.  So he had a talk with me.  He's a real country redneck from Albuquerque.  I hope she's not listening this morning.  Hey, wow.  He said, you know, I go to Denny's, and I see a white man with his white family  and a black people with their black family.  I mean, it's nice.  You know, that's how it ought to be, you know?  Wow.  Nice little sit down. 
[03:57:00]  All the wedding photos are cropped.  It's just her?  Just a black hand on her waist?  What happened?  Who is that?  You are a genius.  Did they lay down the law to you?  Oh, yeah.  Her mom said, you know, Sammy is a little bit prejudiced.  Oh, sweet Jesus.  Don't be listening.  Sammy is a little bit prejudiced, so he is not going to be happy with this.  And I was just like, oh, that's fantastic.  Oh, that's wonderful.  How about your parents, dude?  How are your parents about it?  Oh, no, they're cool.  I mean, my dad is a racist, but he's schizo. 
[03:57:30]  You know, he's kind of schizo with it.  Is he an old school black racist?  Yeah, you know, he was in the era when him and my mom were pregnant, and they were denied  the end, just like Jesus was.  And they're like, no, you can't sleep here.  Find somewhere else, you little nigger.  Wow.  So he'll say racist things to me, and I'm just kind of holding my tongue, because, you  know, of course, he's my dad.  So it's all good.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  I guess who's coming to dinner with P.B.A. and Sammy.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  That was a good movie.  A little campy, but it was very good.  I saw that recently, yeah.  It was like, yeah, because it all kind of works out in the end or something like that. 
[03:58:00]  But there were some real tense moments where it was like, oh, this father just can't  stand him.  You want to talk about embarrassing?  He uses Sidney Poitier.  His father was a mailman, and he uses this speech on him.  And I got drunk one time, and I gave the same speech to my dad, but I tried to force the  conversation in the same way.  Oh, Jimmy, don't tell us stuff like that.  You got a line or two you can tell us on the speech?  I, um, the father said to the son, uh, you owe me. 
[03:58:30]  And Poitier yells, uh, uh, no, you brought me into this world.  I don't care if you carried that bag 40,000 miles.  You, you did what you were supposed to do because you owed me.  It was something along those lines.  I haven't seen it in a long time.  Oh, and you, yeah.  Yeah, but I, but I made it go in that direction because I was drunk.  So you forced the conversation just so you could use it.  They were just ignoring me because I was drunk and arguing with them.  And they were watching television like, just shut up, little man.  And I made it go that way.  Oh, I did that with my dad, uh, about schoolwork.  I wasn't doing my schoolwork and I forced him into me saying stuff like, you can't stay 
[03:59:00]  down with three barrels in them.  Not with three, like completely out of context.  Hey, I want to thank Boston for the Intel.  We're getting some Intel.  This is the Opie and Anthony show, by the way, we're in the middle of playing.  My baby is black from 1961.  And we're hearing, we're hearing things.  Yeah.  They dumped out in Boston, Boston.  They dumped out in Boston of all places.  They just didn't like the idea that a white and a black had bedded together. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, at all.  Not language.  It wasn't the language.  I'm hearing, I'm hearing they dumped out in Boston and possibly in Detroit.  Now I understand about Detroit.  Why?  But Boston.  You would think Boston would love to broadcast this all over the place.  Maybe they didn't get the word from the lawyers.  It only happened yesterday.  Look, man.  That's true.  It happened yesterday.  There's new rules in place for the Opie and Anthony show.  So a little message to Dave, who fully supports this show, by the way. 
[04:00:00]  You're going to have to have a conversation with Al and the lawyers and possibly Tom Chiasano.  See, here's somebody saying, no, I heard it on BCN on the ride and they didn't dump.  There you go.  See, some people, who said they dumped?  This, you know what?  Some people are retarded.  They hear me do this sometimes.  They hear me do this.  See, this is a beep that I have on a sound machine, people.  And I usually say, you know, if it came into my house, there'd be trouble. 
[04:00:30]  You know, but it's not beeping out the words.  I could talk right over it.  See, that's what I'm doing.  I'm talking over it.  It's a beep that is on a machine.  They probably heard that.  So they're confused.  And the dumb ass thinks that we're beeping out of things or they're dumping out.  When they dump, you don't hear a beep, idiot.  You just hear a nothingness.  It goes to another part of the show a little later on.  It jumps to the future.  You know, though, but they're saying that they dumped out of the line the woman said. 
[04:01:00]  So now I'm suspicious.  We'll get to the bottom of it.  But just in case, we'll play a family-friendly version for Boston and for the other stations  that may have dumped out of it just to get everyone up to speed.  It's quick.  We're in the middle.  My baby is black.  Parents freak out, discovering daughter's pregnancy.  We played the unedited clip before the break.  Just in case your city did dump out, that's a shame because there's new rules in place 
[04:01:30]  for the Opie and Anthony show.  We're pushing the lawyers.  We have to push the lawyers.  We've got to push back.  We're pushing back.  We're taking some ground back.  That's right.  Just a little bit, a little bit.  So just in case they did dump out, here's the same line, you know, cleaned up a little  bit.  What have we done for God to inflict such punishment on us?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God in heaven.  My daughter pregnant by a...  What will people think?  We must get rid of it.  Father, how can you think about a thing like that? 
[04:02:00]  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  That's a sin.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  The child that a... put in you is a stain.  There is no religion when one lives with...  No religion?  No religion.  Now, what's interesting about that clip, too, it sounds like Dr. Smith, the father.  Oh, dear.  The father had a little lost-in-space Dr. Smith in him.  Young Penny, you shouldn't bed down with a... 
[04:02:30]  Oops.  Whoa!  Oh, dear.  Help me.  Now, Penny, what you have inside you is a stain.  Whoa!  Get a nice white boy like William.  That's how I like him.  Ooh.  Are you Chris Hansen from Bateline NBC?  Oh, no, dear.  I wasn't doing anything.  I was bringing the young boy licorice and Zima. 
[04:03:00]  Whoa!  Oh, no, Penny.  We've landed on the planet of the...  What will we do?  I'm lost.  Warning!  Warning, Penny Robinson.  I detect a...  In the vicinity.  Do not listen to jazz music.  It will make you pregnant.  Warning!  Warning!  And Will, run.  Run for your life. 
[04:03:30]  He's a pedophile.  Who doesn't know this?  Is that the voice of the Negro?  The Negro!  Because...  Warning!  Warning!  Warning!  Because we learned that they could be machines.  I am a machine.  I, in fact, am a...  Why do I sound like Rock Quarry?  How does that happen?  I have to work this out at home.  I have homework to do in voice school.  That would mean doing show prep.  Show prep?  What is that?  Warning! 
[04:04:00]  Warning!  Warning!  Show preps for the newbies in this business.  Oh, I thought you were going to say it was for the...  Well, hey, let's say hi to Josh in Detroit.  Josh, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Josh.  Hey, just wanted to say they did dump out in Detroit.  Aw, come on.  Well, the word's got to get out, I guess.  There's new rules in place.  So what, we got to play, like, each version of the clip now?  No, one version and then get the word out.  That's it.  They have to get the word out.  We just had this conversation yesterday, so maybe other markets can know that we kind of, 
[04:04:30]  you know, this is...  It's history.  It's a little taste of history.  Yeah.  Of course, we're throwing a little comedy in there to keep it light, but it's nothing  that shouldn't be aired.  Well, it's...  It's what people's ideology was back then.  This gets really interesting, by the way.  So, the white girl's pregnant by the black guy.  Parents have freaked out, okay? 
[04:05:00]  The next clip...  Have they?  The next clip...  Yeah.  The girl doesn't know where her boyfriend is.  Oh, no!  The black neighbor has to inform her that he has been arrested.  So I guess...  What?  I guess he didn't come by the house, so she went looking for him in the neighborhood,  and one of the black neighbors said, yes, your boyfriend has been arrested.  No good could come of that.  This will be the unedited clip.  But nothing from this 1961 should be unplayable in 2007. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, I know.  Nothing should be unplayable.  Jeez.  This many years later.  There we go.  Yes, your nigger is gone.  The police got him a while ago.  Shame on you.  With your beauty, you could have a better man.  Oh, my God!  It's a Stepford wife!  Wow.  She is brutal.  Mom's not a big slack giver, is she?  You know what?  I'm going to start by playing the friendly clip. 
[04:06:00]  I want everyone on board.  And then we'll play the unedited.  They're two quick clips, so it's worth it here.  Yes, your nigger is gone.  The police got him a while ago.  Shame on you.  With your beauty, you could have a better man.  You fool.  Wasting your time with a black.  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  I don't like the cadence of her voice, though.  We've arrested him on two counts of being a ****. 
[04:06:30]  One count of ****ness, and one count of being ****ly.  Shame on you.  With your beauty.  Carrying melanin without a license.  Can you please play where she goes, huh?  Yeah.  That awful huff.  She huffed.  Well, here's for the cool cities.  For the cool cities, here's the unedited version.  Yes, your nigger is gone.  The police got him a while ago. 
[04:07:00]  Shame on you.  With your beauty.  You could have a better man.  You fool.  Wasting your time with a black.  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  Wow.  Huh.  She sounds like a delight.  Mom.  Mom rules.  With an iron fist.  With a pure white iron fist.  With your beauty. 
[04:07:30]  My loving family.  All right.  There's no religion with a stain.  All right, Dad.  Thanks.  They're just tossing away all the Uncle Ben's rice out of the cabinets.  Anything that reminds them.  Aunt Jemima's syrup's going in the garbage.  They probably kept it separate from the other products anyway.  In the back of the house.  In the back of the cupboards.  Black boyfriend in jail for hitting a butcher, torturing a black kid. 
[04:08:00]  Hmm.  Okay.  So I guess the butcher was torturing a black kid.  So the black guy who got this white girl pregnant helped out the black kid, right?  Yeah.  And you know how that turns out.  He hit Sam.  Sam the butcher.  He should have hit Mike Brady for what he did to the black kid.  Hey, we got a great suggestion for the show.  Someone wants a pal talk camera in Al's office.  Al.  Oh, wow.  That would be good. 
[04:08:30]  Just watch him dump.  Uh, this is very funny.  Pay attention to what the butcher did to the kid.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Did he, uh...  No?  You know, did he, uh...  No?  You know.  All right, we'll find out.  Covered him with...  Oh, no, no, no.  What?  Just play it.  Just play it.  Boy, you just now admitted you asked the butcher for three slices of fresh ham from his refrigerator. 
[04:09:00]  Then what?  Wait, he's in, uh, court at this point?  Oh, he's at the police station.  That kind of doesn't sound like a, uh, police officer from the 60s.  Or an actor.  No.  No.  Sounds more like John or Jeff.  It is horrible.  We're two guys who believe that blacks shouldn't shop at the butcher shop.  All right.  Boy, you just now admitted you asked the butcher for three slices of fresh ham from his refrigerator. 
[04:09:30]  Then what?  What happened?  Come on.  Speak up.  Tell us.  He gave me a very funny look.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe because I'm black.  Okay.  Then what happened?  He smeared my head with lard and then pushed me into his big refrigerator.  I was only joking.  I'll do it.  It's a little joke.  I was only joking. 
[04:10:00]  Greatest movie ever.  Oh.  I was only joking.  And the kid.  Put lard in the poor kid's hair.  He's the kid's the best actor so far.  He sounds like the daughter.  Yeah.  It's the same person.  Same.  Imagine.  Oh, well, in that case, you're free to go.  You're free to go.  I didn't know you were just joking.  Hey, we didn't know it was a joke.  Sure.  I'm only joking.  Come on.  Hey, then what happened?  He smeared my head with lard and then pushed me into his big refrigerator. 
[04:10:30]  I was only joking.  Of course.  Go on and tell the whole story.  I was afraid.  It was very dark.  Then I cried and screamed.  That didn't last long, did it?  No.  A man opened the door for me and then I got out.  It was him.  Then, after that you were free, he hit the butcher, didn't he?  And beat him, kicked him, stomped him.  No, he didn't kick.  He hit him real hard in the stomach.  It was great.  Actually, you're pressing charges. 
[04:11:00]  Of course.  See what that did to my face?  Do you have a doctor's certificate?  I sure do.  This is it.  It's properly signed.  Very well.  Oh.  It's Sam the Butcher.  That's exactly who that is.  Sam the Butcher.  So what happened here?  Sam the Butcher's white.  Black kid comes in.  He covers him in lard.  Yeah.  Put his head in lard.  And threw him in the refrigerator.  But he was only joking.  Yeah, he was only joking.  And then the other black guy, that's the father of the baby, opened up the door, got him out, 
[04:11:30]  and then punched the butcher.  In the belly.  In the belly.  But he's hit in the face.  Because he's got a doctor's certificate.  You've got to find more clips from this movie.  That's it.  This is pretty much all we got?  Is this the entire movie?  Pretty much.  That's it.  A lot of it is just long instrumentals where you just see them walking around and thinking.  Thinking.  Yeah.  Art piece.  All right.  We've got a final clip.  Dream sequence.  Uh-oh. 
[04:12:00]  Deciding to have the baby or not.  Mixing races is not good.  Well, my dear.  And if he were white, it would be different.  Will you be able to love me enough?  To forget?  She should be ashamed.  Yes, I know.  F***s are nice.  But it is a stain.  That's Angela. 
[04:12:30]  Was she like tossing and turning?  She's laying there sleeping and you see these fade ins and out of people that she knows giving her advice.  Great advice.  It's 1961.  And they show the butcher doing questionable things with sausage links.  It's a joke.  I'm just kidding.  Come on.  I'm kidding.  I was kidding.  You want to hear that clip unedited?  You know, I can't even put lard in her hair, man.  My freezer is so polluted. 
[04:13:00]  Mixing races is not good.  Well, my dear.  A nigger.  If he were white, it would be different.  Will you be able to love me enough?  To forget?  She should be ashamed.  Yes, I know.  A nigger's a knife, but it is a stain. 
[04:13:30]  She said they were nice.  But.  But.  There's always a but.  There's a big but here.  Mom drops that N-bomb a lot, doesn't she?  Yeah.  Wow.  Sounds like my mom.  The obvious question, did she have the baby or not?  At the beginning of the movie, she has the baby.  Then it cuts back to how it led up to the baby.  Ah, so apparently, it's like Memento.  Yeah, the ending is her and the guy walking in a park pushing the baby.  Thanks for giving it away.  You just ruined the end. 
[04:14:00]  Thanks.  That kid's 46 right now?  Yeah.  How about that?  You know, that child was me.  Yes.  61.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Someone has a great observation about the butcher from My Baby is Black.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Tommy from Bayside.  What's up?  What's up, boys?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  Is it just me, or does this butcher sound like Kenny? 
[04:14:30]  The butcher sounds like Club Soda Kenny.  Except more tolerant.  I busted him right in the old soup coolers.  Yo, guys, great radio, man.  This is excellent.  Yeah, we're getting there.  Thanks, sir.  Thank you, man.  Later, guys.  There's Tommy from Bayside.  I don't want to be the one to tell you this, but he's got lard in his hair.  I want to hear the butcher now.  Uh, let's see. 
[04:15:00]  Before we go to break, I got to...  Got the doctor's note.  Boy, you just now admitted you asked the butcher for three slices of fresh ham from his refrigerator.  Then what?  What happened?  Come on.  Speak up.  Tell us.  He gave me a very funny look.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe because I'm black.  Okay.  Then what happened?  He smeared my head with lard and then pushed me into his big refrigerator. 
[04:15:30]  I was only joking.  Of course.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  It was a little Kenny-esque.  That's the exact conversation he had to have, too, with a lawyer about a year ago.  You ought to take your own advice as the butcher and spread lard in your hair.  Dry head.  That tumbleweed that he's got on his...  Oh, my God.  Oh, the lard would just dry up on contact. 
[04:16:00]  Instantly.  Fall off in hard clumps.  Are you joking?  Of course.  Go on and tell the whole story.  I was afraid.  It was very dark.  Then I cried and screamed.  That didn't last long, did it?  No.  A man opened the door for me, and then I got out.  It was him.  Then, after that you were free, he hit the butcher, didn't he?  Beat him.  Kicked him.  Stomped him.  No, he didn't kick.  He hit him real hard in the stomach. 
[04:16:30]  It was great.  Actually, you're pressing charges.  Of course.  See what that did to my face?  Do you have a doctor's certificate?  I sure do.  This is it.  It's properly signed.  Very well.  You have to have the right certificate.  It's freaking club soda, Kenny.  Doesn't work.  What did he do to your face?  He punched my mustache off.  It's signed properly.  It says, hit me in the face. 
[04:17:00]  But, G8, your math is wrong.  It adds up to 122%.  That might be my new favorite part of my baby is black.  Club soda, Kenny lines.  Yeah, as the butcher.  Great.  And club soda, Kenny, as the butcher.  How would Kenny deliver that line?  What's the line?  I was only joking. 
[04:17:30]  I was only joking.  See, it's very similar.  Thank you, Kenny.  Great for pointing that out.  I'm glad we finally got through that.  That was great.  Way better than I thought it would be.  Well worth the week wait.  We finally did it.  One week we got to wait for that.  Thank you.  See, we get to things.  Eventually.  Hey, hey, hey.

[04:22:00]  Just kind of had to keep it close to the vest.  Not a lot of knowledge as far as...  No, I just played my basketball every day.  So I matured a little later than most.  And when I found out about the whole sex thing in Washington Drive School in 5th or 6th grade, 
[04:22:30]  I was horrified, and I ran home, and I ran up into an apple tree, and I stayed there all afternoon long.  Climbed an apple tree.  How all-American and perfect.  I know, that really is.  Norman Rockwell painting.  Well, what horrified me, I know we've told the story a bunch on the air, but it's worth bringing up again today.  You know, you're just a little kid playing soccer and wiffle ball and basketball and doing your little art projects,  and not much heavy lifting going on, especially in grammar school. 
[04:23:00]  It's pretty easy, right?  Yeah.  And then you go to school one day, and your whole freaking life and world changes.  All of a sudden, they're like, oh, we're going to do something a little different today.  And all of a sudden, they separate the boys and the girls.  I'm saying something that a million people understand.  And then you march into the gym in single file.  You know, guys on the right, women, girls on the left.  There's a door in between you.  The big accordion door is shut.  And they show you the film.  We need the music.  The film.  The film. 
[04:23:30]  Dana!  Yes, you know what that film is.  Well, actually, a lot of people don't until they start it rolling.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, what is this?  We're going to watch cartoons.  Well, you're suspicious, though, because you're like, all right, why is it just guys?  And why are the girls on the other side of the door?  All right.  So far, we know we're seeing a film.  What could possibly, what could this film possibly be?  Yeah.  That the girls aren't allowed to watch it?  Oh, well, let me watch it. 
[04:24:00]  Oh, no.  This is, this is the movie.  Oh, no.  I heard about this from the older kids.  And then these cool bastards, they tell you about stuff that you're not even going to  be allowed to do for another six years in general.  Yeah.  Unless you're a lucky little fella.  You're going to have to remember all this info for when it actually comes about.  Yeah.  You're like 11 or 12 and they're telling you about this new world out there, but you can't 
[04:24:30]  touch this new world for another five or six years if you're a good Catholic.  And there were always the kids with the creepy families who are pointing out what's wrong  with the movie.  Yeah, right.  No, this is crap right here, what you're saying.  I'll tell you how to deal with this situation.  Well, those were the hippie families that, you know, walked around their houses nude and  stuff.  Oh, I've seen this crap already.  You'll start to notice hair growing on certain parts of your body.  And girls, you'll notice you'll start growing breasts. 
[04:25:00]  And then you show some little fella trying to shave for the first time.  Yeah.  This is where hygiene becomes very important.  Explaining what whiskers really are.  You're going to have to wash every day.  Your body is changing.  Wash your arms.  Yeah.  Under your arms.  Your body is changing.  You'll notice hair growing on places that didn't have hair before.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It's, oh, it is.  This is embarrassing.  And if I'm not mistaken, back in the day, because we're a little older, we got to see  a little nudity with our film.  Yeah, it was like cartoon nudity. 
[04:25:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't see any real nudity.  We used to have to...  Cartoon nudity was the bomb, though.  Invade the library to try to find, like, real nudity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes they'd have those.  Nowadays, I guess they really kind of weed that out.  But books in my library and, like, even elementary school, if you were clever enough and kind  of took enough time to really look, you could find naked girls in there.  I used to find naked stuff in dictionaries.  Biology books.  Dictionaries.  Dictionaries?  Yeah, little sketches.  The little sketch?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Would you look up, like, V, A. 
[04:26:00]  No, just like...  You wouldn't?  Well, I'm sure...  And then there'd be, like, a picture of it?  No, I'm sure I did.  I'm trying to remember what would get you to the naked sketches in the dictionary.  Maybe something about pregnancy or something, so then you have a sketch of a pregnant woman.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  Encyclopedias are good also.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they used to have the entire encyclopedia set in the library, and you'd just break  out one of those, make like you're studying something, you know.  Make like you're studying, I don't know, Virginia. 
[04:26:30]  Yeah.  And then you'd pull out the old V.  Change a letter or two.  Yeah.  Come here.  Where's the C volume in the encyclopedia?  So then they...  Grammar...  What birthday is this?  Grammar school.  Grammar school.  Oh, nice.  It's like you're the little rascals.  Wow.  Well, people usually say grade school or just...  Grammar school, I would say.  Grammar school? 
[04:27:00]  Didn't we just say...  I never called it grammar school.  I think we used to say grammar school growing up.  I called it elementary school.  Elementary school?  It was elementary school for me.  Yeah.  And then, you know, middle school, junior high, high school.  Whatever you call it.  Anyway...  That's the...  I picture the single school house, the little house on the prairie kids going.  So then the film is over, and then the gym teacher or whoever the hell showed us the  damn film in grade school said, well, we instructed your parents, you know, to ask you about the 
[04:27:30]  film and to help you along and help answer some of the questions you might have after seeing  this film.  And that's when I...  And then they gave us the rest of the day off because this was heavy lifting for an  11 or 12 year old.  You can't wrap your mind around it.  You can't go, you know, to gym class after that and throw the huge ball around.  No.  Or climb the ropes or anything.  This was a serious day, so it was a half a day for everybody.  And I ran home because my house was close to Washington Drive School out there in Centerport. 
[04:28:00]  And I proceeded because I knew, my parents knew that I saw the film, that I had to run  up into the apple tree and I stayed there for the rest of the afternoon and my dad was  at the bottom of the tree, I'll never forget it, trying to coerce me down.  Talk you down, man.  Saying, it's not going to be that bad.  We'll keep it quick.  Because I guess they were supposed to talk to you.  Every single...  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, man, I don't want to deal with this.  I just want to play my basketball.  I'm not ready for this, man.  I had a similar experience because I went home and asked my dad, I said, Dad, I have 
[04:28:30]  a question.  And he goes, yeah, your mom is a c***.  I was like, oh, no, that's not what I...  Yeah, your son just came in here and he's asking me questions.  But why don't you shut up, you ex-fave?  Oh, give me a break, you...  Yeah, you bitch.  Where's my whiskey?  Oh, I saw a movie in school and I need help.  This is because of you, Ro.  This is why he c*** and cries all the time.  It's your fault, Ro. 
[04:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Joe, he's sensitive because you're yelling all the time.  Go c*** yourself.  What do you want to know?  Yeah, I threw my c*** into her c*** and you came out.  That's all you need to know.  Stop your crying.  You're like a goddamn c***.  Get...  That was my question and answer period with Dad.  Then I think he threw some food against the wall.  And went out to... 
[04:29:30]  I used to think that's how you served food.  Just...  It was the first time I actually liked a girl and cooked for her.  I lobbed it against the wall.  Yeah.  To show my love.  A little uncomfortable there, right?  Yeah.  What, are you on the same cycle as your mother, you fruit?  Daddy, I have a question.  Where do babies come from?  Why do you have to ask?  You're one.  You're crying like one.  You're a grown man.  You're seven. 
[04:30:00]  Get a job.  But I'm only seven.  Have a shot, you puss.  Where do we go to the ball game, Dad?  Can we go to the Met game?  They're playing at Shea.  No.  I'm busy.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  I gotta go to the bar.  I'm going to see my gumar.  Just trying to get some strange.  Babies, they come from your mom's b***h.  Hey, all you need to know. 
[04:30:30]  Run into my room.  Slam the door.  Cry.  Don't make me come in there.  I'm crying already.  Why would you hit me?  Why hit me, Daddy?  Daddy.  And he used to hit me with his belt.  Yeah.  And he'd have to say things as he hit me.  Like, don't you ever do that again, because...  I understand the concept of the syllables, Dad. 
[04:31:00]  You don't have to beat it into me with your belt.  And you don't have to add more syllables.  Yeah.  Because you were very bad today.  And I don't think that was the proper thing for you to have done.  Ow!  Dad, you're a little wordy.  Dad, yeah.  This is quite a wordy beating.  Ow!  You used to be angelic.  Angelic?  Angelic.  Now you're just a f*** get. 
[04:31:30]  Can you give me the cliff notes beating, Dad?  Yeah.  Yeah, please.  Could you edit this down?  I'm really hurting.  Give me an editor.  My hiney's hurting from your belt.  It's not a puppet, Roe.  It's a doll.  Oh, that one I had to deal with.  What?  Oh.  I was making a puppet when I was a kid.  I wanted to make a puppet.  A marionette-type puppet.  So I took, like, some paper towels and masking tape, and I made a puppet, but I hadn't had 
[04:32:00]  the string and the wood to make it a marionette yet.  Right.  I was a kid!  Anthony, a little something about Anthony, he's obviously highly intelligent.  Thank you, O.K.  And he never graduated high school, probably because of his family life.  I had to smoke a lot of pot.  Over the years, he would tell me about his science experiments he used to do as a kid  and how he would take things apart to see how they worked.  Like, he was very, very...  Alone. 
[04:32:30]  Alone.  You were very adventurous, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I would build things and take things apart and chemistry sets.  You probably could have been something really, really big.  Yeah, I could have been.  Instead, I'm here.  You should have been the little girl from Sixth Sense.  So you were making a puppet.  I was making a marionette puppet, and I didn't have the string, but I kind of made it, and  I was kind of proud of it, and it was fun to, like, play with, and I wanted to take it 
[04:33:00]  because we were all going to the store, so I took it with me into the car.  We all hopped in the car, and I took it out of the car once we got to the supermarket.  My father goes, what are you doing with that?  I go, it's a puppet.  I'm taking it inside.  He goes, it's not a puppet.  It's a doll.  You leave it in the car.  I'm not going to have my son play with a doll.  And then told your mom it was a doll.  And my mother's just like, Joey, it's a puppet.  Ro, it's a f***ing doll.  You want him to be a f***ing kid? 
[04:33:30]  It's a doll, Ro.  And I'm like, it's a puppet.  I just need the string.  Yeah, you need a string?  Do I have to beep that?  Of course not.  They come with strings.  A tampon.  I'll beep string.  You wanted the puppet to kind of have that imaginary world around you.  Yeah, it was me and my puppet.  Well, the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.  Little boy blue and the man in the moon. 
[04:34:00]  When you're coming home, son, I don't know when.  But we'll get together then.  Dad.  No, we won't.  You cry, baby.  Oh, was I always weeping.  And then we'll have.  And then you'll have a drink together.  My father yelled at me so bad when the car overheated and flushing once.  It was pouring rain.  The car overheated.  It stalled.  And I was crying my eyes out.  And he's aggravated because it's pouring rain.  He's under the hood.  And I'm just.  And he's like, what's wrong? 
[04:34:30]  Would you shut him up?  He's just upset, Joey.  What upset?  He's a f***ing fruit.  He should have used your tears to throw into the.  Yeah, let me hold him over the radiator and just squeeze the tears out of him.  At least we can use these tears for something useful.  Oh, I got a cramp in my leg once.  And it was so bad.  And I was a kid.  And I just screamed bloody murder. 
[04:35:00]  It was the first time it ever happened.  And it felt like I was stabbed in my leg.  And I screamed.  I was like.  And he goes, what's the matter with you?  I got a pain in my leg.  He goes, it's a cramp.  He goes, if you ever make a f***ing sound like that again, you better have an arrow in you.  What a baby.  No, no, no.  Just a baby.  I'm waving off that pitch.  That is really funny.  No, my father didn't rip the puppet up. 
[04:35:30]  But I think I did take it inside with me.  And my mom's like laughing at my father.  For me, it was just a matter of, oh, I get to take my puppet with me.  But between my parents, it was my mother going, I won this one, ass.  I won this one, Joey.  And I know your mom pretty well.  She's an awesome lady.  She's changed like light years from back then, too.  I'm sure behind closed doors, she kind of gave you your puppet bag and said, it's okay, Anthony.  It's okay.  It's a puppet.  Here's your puppet.  You do whatever you want.  It's a doll, Rosemary. 
[04:36:00]  Doll, it's a puppet.  I should have just turned gay just to really screw him up.  You should have turned.  I guess he didn't have an open mind as far as that stuff goes, huh?  Nah, not really.  My father was so old school.  It was just ridiculous.  Talk about lack of tolerance.  I heard words that, by God, I still use.  I mean, I heard...

The best of Ron and Fez starts now. 
[04:45:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  It's the best of Ron and Fez.  I'm Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley, producer for the Ron and Fez show.  We're off today. 
[04:46:00]  Happy Labor Day.  I hope it's Labor Day and not Memorial Day because I get those two mixed up.  I'm pretty sure it's Labor Day.  Well, we'll be back live tomorrow.  But this Labor Day, best of, let's jump right into it.  Coming up for the first segment of the show, we're going to go all the way back to when that Chris Dorner controversy was happening.  Chris Dorner was a cop who went rogue, killed a few people, and went on the run. 
[04:46:30]  Some people thought it was a conspiracy that would eventually happen to him.  He was killed in a cabin out west.  Some people thought he was just a crazy psychopath.  But this segment coming up concerns the million-dollar bounty that was placed on his head.  That brought up the conversation of, is a cop's life worth more than a civilian's?  That's coming up next on the best of Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez. 
[04:47:00]  Fez tried to put up this story last night about Grammy having extra security because of the rogue cop and cop killer.  And I'm like, fuck it, they're such pussies.  No.  The fact that their ego is so gigantic that they think this guy is going to come back and shoot them, he's not.  The fucking guy is gone. 
[04:47:30]  There's a million-dollar bounty on his fucking head.  He's in the mountain somewhere.  Or maybe he just burned that truck and this shit is some tradecraft type shit.  Zero Dark Thirty fucking spy game.  All he has to do is have some chick that nobody knows about.  It's that simple.  If there's some girl that he just bangs on the fucking outside and is like, let's keep this from me and you, he could be in her attic right now.  And no one's ever going to know about it.  I'm starting to think.  There's all these conspiracy theories out about the guy. 
[04:48:00]  By conspiracy theories, do you mean online fan clubs?  That's also strange.  They're calling him Black Rambo.  I think of him as Legend of Billie Jean.  Fair is fair.  Um, you honestly start to believe something in conspiracies?  I hate conspiracy theories.  I hate them.  But this is so weird in that he's been able to actually get away from the cops and that he's fucking just gone now.  And this is like the biggest bounty in fucking Los Angeles history. 
[04:48:30]  Well, it's a giant manhunt.  Biggest manhunt in Los Angeles history.  Biggest bounty in like Southern California or whatever ever.  Now, I'm going to tell you this.  When I heard about the bounty, the million-dollar bounty, and I guess the city's putting this up, right?  Yeah.  I haven't felt offended.  You know, we have a lot of regular people who get murdered every day, and there's no bounty.  No.  I mean, you're now saying, okay, cop's life more important than a housewife's life. 
[04:49:00]  Here in New York, they have the cop killer reward or whatever.  This is $25,000 leading to the arrest of someone involved in a cop.  A cop getting shot.  That's all over the place.  Well, who puts that up?  Private people?  I think that's the cops.  Yeah.  See, that I don't mind because private people can put up whatever they want.  But when the city says, we are mad about this, we're putting up a million dollars, right?  Why aren't you mad anytime anyone gets fucking murdered?  Maybe we should be constantly throwing up a million dollars. 
[04:49:30]  Because the media ran with this one.  Because the media ran with it because the cops went on this massive manhunt that we've never seen before.  They actually accidentally shooting people.  Jesus.  I mean, and that plays into the conspiracy thing.  Like, wait, what are you doing now?  How?  Why is it so important?  Like, if this was a movie, you'd be like, why this guy?  Why so important?  And they shot up that car that barely resembled his and with two women in it. 
[04:50:00]  It's a lot of weird shit going on here.  And apparently, they're saying that this guy was high up.  His security clearance or whatever in the Navy was really high up so he might know shit.  And they think they're just trying to assassinate the guy at this point.  Now it's like this is being like a Jamie Foxx movie, a Will Smith movie.  You know, like, do you think Hollywood helps us get into these conspiracy heads? 
[04:50:30]  All right, 866-RON-ZERO-FEZ, 866-RON-ZERO-FEZ.  But I knew you guys answered me back.  Are you offended that this guy's capture is more important than any other capture?  Yeah, because the reason for it is they're embarrassed.  They can't get the guy.  He's one of their own.  I think...  Well, he's not one of their own.  He's fired.  So he's definitely not one of their own.  As a matter of fact, it's almost the exact opposite of one of their own.  Because apparently, he was a fucking squealer. 
[04:51:00]  But I think that gets around the thing of, why aren't you embarrassed every time there's an unsolved murder?  Why aren't you embarrassed every time?  I mean, we actually could put up a lot of money  every time something like this comes up.  Here's Dennis.  Dennis, you're on the RON-A-Fest show.  Good morning, Ronnie B.  The idea is not so much that a cop's life is worth more than somebody else's. 
[04:51:30]  But it's the idea that somebody that would kill a cop or specifically target cops,  since they represent and protect society, is that you're targeting society as a whole.  So if somebody's specifically targeting the protector of society,  what can they possibly do to the rest of everybody else?  And yet, we're not hearing about that happen.  You understand?  Like, a cop killer isn't necessarily somebody who's normally on a cop rampage.  Son of Sam targeted society. 
[04:52:00]  Obviously, any psycho killer, any mass murderer, anybody who goes out there killing women,  the hillside strangler was against society.  Your point being that there's something about the law enforcement part of society  that is more important to society than college girls.  Well, they're calling him a domestic terrorist that you don't get with other everyday murders. 
[04:52:30]  How do you not say that if a guy is going around choking college girls until he dies?  The sniper was a domestic terrorist.  I didn't see the million dollars go up for him.  I'm just saying, when you put the million dollar up for a cop killer,  it's almost like the government's saying,  you don't understand, this is about us now.  Not you fucking people.  Not your kids. 
[04:53:00]  This is about us.  I think it would look better if they just treated it like they would anyone else.  Rich, you're on the Ren and Fed show.  Hey, Billion and a Half, Ronnie.  Yeah.  A great interview, by the way, with Jane Lynch.  I loved her in that movie, Role Model.  I thought that's like...  She was fucking hysterical.  Huh?  You doing blow?  Is that it?  You're sucking dick for cock?  It was so fucking funny. 
[04:53:30]  And I've been in that meeting before.  I've had those discussions.  Yeah, it was great.  I loved that movie.  Well, I think maybe we might look at it as a Mark Wahlberg, the shooter movie,  where he might be being framed.  See, this is what Hicks is saying.  I'm buying into it.  And this giant manhunt...  He's a drunken pill popper.  Yeah.  I don't believe anything...  You're a dick from Virginia.  But it is true.  You are a drunken pill popper.  But let's get back to this.  The reason why there's conspiracy theories is because he's being treated differently than anyone else. 
[04:54:00]  And that makes people go, well, why?  What does he possibly know?  Because now they're acting like just killing somebody isn't enough.  Even killing a cop isn't enough.  Because we don't normally act this way.  Let's go over to AJ.  You're on the Run of Fez show. 
[04:54:30]  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead, AJ.  Oh, it's AJ.  But, yeah, I personally think that that guy's going to turn up dead.  The way they're just shooting randomly without verifying who's in each vehicle first  and filling it with 50 bullets lets you know that this guy knows something  that they really don't want to get out and they're going to kill him real quickly  and make it pained like it was a shootout or he would reach for something  and he's going to turn up dead.  Well, that is what Chris Stanley now also believes. 
[04:55:00]  Yeah, there's something fishy going on.  They have drones after this guy.  They're fucking just laying out everything they possibly can in this gigantic manhunt.  See, I think it would look better if they acted like this every time there was a murder.  Like, we have to solve this.  This is absolutely important.  No, they're used to just regular people getting murdered.  It's complacency or something or just it happens every day so they're just fucking burnt out  or so many murders happen that they're just... 
[04:55:30]  I just think it's one of those things that, you know,  when people are saying that the regular people don't respect government  or don't respect authority, this is one of the reasons  because you're acting like if something happens to one of you guys,  it's more important than what happens to regular people on the street.  Joe Oxycontin, if you will. 
[04:56:00]  Here's Ann.  Ann, you're on the Renafest Show.  Yeah, they're shooting him differently because he didn't just kill a cop.  He was trying to kill the daughter of a cop.  And he killed a cop accidentally when he was trying to kill her.  Why would he want to kill the daughter of a cop?  That's so weird.  Because this cop apparently pissed him off.  So he was going after his daughter.  So fucking crazy.  Now, again, I get it,  but if you're going after anyone's daughter,  why is it that a million dollars?  You know, if you're going after Chris, 
[04:56:30]  if Chris Stanley finds out someone's targeting his daughter,  why wouldn't that just be as important  as someone targeting a cop's daughter or a politician's daughter?  I'm going to keep Stanley Etta very safe.  Stanley Etta?  Sure.  You're fucking like George Foreman.  Here's Dan.  Dan, you're on the Renafest Show.  Hey, guys.  Just wanted to say that, you know,  these cops, they're charged with protecting and serving,  but, you know, now they've got to protect and serve 
[04:57:00]  constantly looking over their shoulder.  I'd be doing that anyway if I was an L.A. cop.  Yeah, that's true, but this guy,  this guy is specifically targeting them,  you know, not just any Tom, Dick, or Harry on the street.  That's my thought on it.  I'm not sure about it.  I get what you're saying,  but the whole thing of Tom, Dick, and Harry,  as if the rest of society is interchangeable  and people with badges or political people  because it's just treating something differently. 
[04:57:30]  In other words, let's suppose there was a disease out there, right,  that was only targeting hetero people, Fez, right?  Hetero sex.  And suddenly everyone acted like this is the most important disease in history,  then you would be a little turned off.  That's my point to this.  It would come across better from a society standpoint 
[04:58:00]  if we stopped acting like people who kill cops  are even worse than people who kill college girls.  That's the problem with this.  Let's go over to Alex.  You're on the Run of Fez show.  Hey, guys, I think what's different here,  what might be different is,  since this guy's got a manifesto and it's in public  and there's like a hit list of people he wants to kill,  I think that's what sets a level of urgency in this case 
[04:58:30]  versus other people.  I did not see that in the manifesto.  In the manifesto I saw,  it's performers that he really thought did some good work.  Oh, Shark Week.  Charlie Sheen.  Patrice O'Neal.  Louis C.K.  He's a big fan of all those people.  I think if you were Louis C.K.,  you'd be like, really?  You had to bring up my name with this?  After that whole Peeping Tom thing,  fucking California's getting a little weird.  Yeah, they're getting a little weird? 
[04:59:00]  Just now.  I call them the land of fruits and nuts,  and then I start laughing.  All right, here's Brian.  He's a police officer in San Diego.  Go ahead, Brian.  All right, yeah, I think some of the reasons,  I get what you're saying about the bounty,  how maybe it looks bad since the cop killer,  but we've got to remember that he killed two people  before he shot at the cops,  and he brutally beat up that 81-year-old boat owner  down here in San Diego trying to steal his boat.  So I think it's a combination of the whole rampage 
[04:59:30]  and the fact that he's so out of it  and so unpredictable that's led to the bounty  more than just that he killed the cop in Riverside.  Now, so you were saying that it's because  even if there wasn't a cop in this,  the million-dollar bounty would have went up.  I'd like to say that.  I see where you're coming from,  where it might not have,  but I think they're able to put that out there  with...  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from. 
[05:00:00]  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from.  I see where you're coming from. </pre>
