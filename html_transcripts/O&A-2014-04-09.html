<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, heavily focused on the recent death of Ultimate Warrior.  Calls debated the controversial exclusion of listeners "Lady Di" and "Bobo" from the upcoming "Unmasked" event, with audio clips playing their previous pleas and angry reactions.  The Iron Sheik's previous day's appearance was extensively discussed, featuring clips of his insults directed at Hulk Hogan, Rob Ford, and Justin Bieber.  E-Rock's Cronut shop antics and a local news appearance were highlighted.  Other news items touched upon included the missing Malaysian plane and Reverend Al Sharpton’s comments.  The pre-show concluded by mentioning the upcoming show's guests: Danny Trejo and Bob Saget (Brandon Steiner was uninvited), and lamenting Sam Roberts' missed opportunity to interview the Warrior, playing a clip of the Sheik calling him a "male prostitute."

The main show opened with a discussion of Ultimate Warrior's death, analyzing his final appearance and playing a “creepy” and “fucked up” self-eulogizing clip.  Merchandising opportunities were discussed, transitioning into graphic jokes about Sean Penn's daughter's nude photos.  The conversation shifted to listener Roland’s subway high-five quest and his picture with the Warrior.  Reverend Al Sharpton was then derisively referred to as a "fucking rat," with discussion of his alleged FBI informant status and accusations of  "pussy"-like behavior.  A listener called in with unsubstantiated claims of an upcoming Al Sharpton sex tape, followed by graphic descriptions and jokes about a topless woman causing a disturbance at a McDonald's.  The show then discussed a racially charged incident involving a white man beaten into a coma, criticizing the incomplete reporting.  The segment concluded mentioning the upcoming guests, Bob Saget and Danny Trejo.

The show continued with a mockery of Bruce Hornsby's "The Way It Is," comparing it favorably to a Tupac version.  A caller, Richie from Long Island, shared a humorous airport anecdote and criticized his experiences with Orthodox Jewish families, leading to a discussion about Al Sharpton and the ironic coincidence of a journalist named Pistone writing about him.  The majority of this segment focused on a heated exchange with Bobo, who was banned from "Unmasked," with multiple calls from Bobo, Lady Di, and Marion debating the ban.  Bobo's attempts to reverse the ban were unsuccessful.  Danny Trejo then joined the show in-studio, discussing his life, prison experiences, acting career, and various film roles.

The following segment featured a discussion of boxing, focusing on Joe Frazier, Bernard Hopkins, Floyd Mayweather Jr., and Don King.  A former boxer, a studio guest alongside Danny Trejo, shared anecdotes about San Quentin, his boxing career, and acting.  A phone call from Anthony's brother, Joe, another actor, was also included.  Trejo discussed his film *Badass* and upcoming roles.  This transitioned to a discussion of Bob Saget's new book, *Dirty Daddy*, with Saget joining the show, discussing his book, family life (including his mother's recent death), and career, engaging in humorous and vulgar banter with the hosts.  A brief fire drill interrupted the show.

A later segment revolved around memories of Rodney Dangerfield, his generosity, and his later years.  The upcoming Sam Kinison movie, Josh Gad's involvement, and Jay Roach's potential direction were discussed.  Bob Saget reminisced about his early stand-up career, promoting his book, "Dirty Daddy," and discussing his therapy.  The conversation included tangents on the speaker's air conditioning work, animal anecdotes, and viral videos.  The segment concluded with Saget promoting his book and other media appearances.  Several other individuals were mentioned: Andrew Dice Clay, Harry Basil, Bob Schimmel, Mitzi Shore, Kevin Hart, Mark Price, and Danny Trejo.

The show included a segment consisting entirely of a rapid-fire series of commercial advertisements for various products and services, emphasizing ease of use, human interaction, and cost savings.

[00:01:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  With Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.  Welcome to the pre-show.  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number to call.  866-969-1969.  To be a part of the pre-show as we count down the minutes before Opie and Anthony take the airwaves for another legendary show. 
[00:01:30]  Can you imagine being in a position in broadcasting where every single show that you do is legendary?  That's where Opie and Anthony are.  So let's celebrate that with this here pre-show.  Call up now.  We'll talk about everything that may be going down today.  Everything that went down yesterday.  A lot to get into on the pre-show today.  No doubt.  I kind of have a feeling I know what everybody wants to talk about. 
[00:02:00]  The phone lines are already going a little nuts.  We'll start with Larry in Rhode Island.  What's up, Larry?  Well, good morning, Sam Roberts.  You professional broadcaster, you?  No, well, good morning, Larry.  I was really struck.  Thank you.  I'm doing well.  I hope you're doing well, Sammy.  I really do.  I am.  I was listening to the last replay this morning and listening to the interview with the Iron  Sheik and your post-show interview, and I've heard The Rock use the term jabroni. 
[00:02:30]  In the vernacular, what is a jabroni?  That's a great question.  Of course, the Iron Sheik uses that word very freely.  Jabroni.  It's just that it means it's a loser.  It doesn't mean much more than that.  It's a guy who loses all the time.  It's just a guy who sucks.  It's a word that some wrestlers use to just describe a loser.  That's what the Iron Sheik was using quite a bit yesterday. 
[00:03:00]  Superfan Eric.  Only one way to follow a Larry call, and that's what the Superfan Eric call at 6.02 in the morning.  You've got that right, Sam.  I'm the Superfan Eric.  It's hump day.  It's the day of celebration because my players made the playoffs last night, but Sam, I feel  your pain, my brother.  I want to extend my condolences on the Ultimate Warrior.  I loved him as a kid, growing up, watching him in the Hulkster battle, but that's okay.  Now you got me, Sam.  I'm still here for you, buddy.  I'm a Superfan.  You know what I'm doing right now? 
[00:03:30]  I'm on the Great Road at 95, and my place of business is Philadelphia.  I'm going to make hoagies for the city today.  I love my job.  I love hoagies.  I love my man, St. Roberts.  Larry can go up himself.  Let's go, Flyers.  Sam, sorry about the Ultimate Warrior, but you got me, baby.  The Superfan!  Thank you so much, Superfan Eric.  Oh my God, he's fired up.  Of course, that's a big breaking story that the Ultimate Warrior died last night.  Very strange timing with the whole thing. 
[00:04:00]  It was sort of, I mean, it couldn't have been more sudden.  He was, for the first time in like, I don't know how many years, he was back on WWE TV.  He was at the Hall of Fame over the weekend.  He was at WrestleMania.  He was at Raw on Monday, and then Tuesday night, that's it.  It's scary, and it's sad.  He had his family with him at the Hall of Fame.  He kept talking about how much he loved being a dad, so very, very sad. 
[00:04:30]  But I'm sure that we'll get into everything Ultimate Warrior on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Right now, I want to talk to Marion.  Marion.  Hey, Sam.  Hi.  I want to ask you something.  Is this about the Ultimate Warrior?  Yeah.  No, no.  It's not about the Ultimate Warrior.  It's about this get-together next Thursday.  Look, I can't go, and I don't really, you know, I'm talking to you.  It's because Diane called me up crying, saying that...  Wait, was she crying about the Warrior?  No, no. 
[00:05:00]  You guys don't want her next Thursday at Caroline's.  Right.  Now, I can't go, and I'd tell the...  Quite frankly, I think we'd rather have the Warrior there.  But the thing is, though, why are you saying you guys don't want me there?  Well, I think that Opie and Anthony yesterday, we'll get into the clips, Opie and Anthony decided  to create a... I think they're calling it the Bobo Rule, and kind of taking the people that  kind of make a scene at show events and asking them not to go, stay on the line. 
[00:05:30]  I understand about Diana and her drinking and everything like that, but me, I can't  go anyway.  But if I wanted to go, I'd go, because I don't make a scene.  Right.  Stay on the line.  Let me bring everybody up to speed on what we're talking about.  You stay there, Marion.  Yeah, because she's only a blast.  I think she was half in the bag, and she's crying and crying.  That doesn't sound like her.  Yeah, it does sound like her.  Oh.  No, really, Sam.  And in order that she is very upset that she can't go. 
[00:06:00]  You guys don't want her there.  All right.  Well, let's hear how the lady die call went yesterday, Sal.  Let's...  Okay.  I don't really know, because I was at work.  No.  No, I know.  I was actually going to play the clip for you so you could hear it.  Right.  How's that sound?  All right.  Do that.  I have my radio, and I'm home.  No, you just listen to the phone.  You just...  You'll hear it.  You'll be on the phone, and you'll hear it.  And I don't understand, like, why.  Of course not.  Well, all right.  I'm going to play the clip.  You stay on the phone, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Here's track 16. 
[00:06:30]  You called yesterday during the show, and then you asked where Sam is, because you wanted  to call the after show and ask Sam and beg for tickets.  Yeah.  When we told you Sam wasn't here, you called anyway.  You called fucking...  Right.  ...Denny and E-Rock and begged for tickets.  And when they wouldn't outright say, oh, we'll get you tickets, you were like, I don't  know, maybe I can get some tickets?  You were a grub.  And then they asked you...  No, I wanted to go to the show.  You're not going.  Exactly.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  After all that I just said, she goes, no, I wanted to go to the show.  What?  How come you don't want me to be there?  Because you're going to interrupt everything.  Because your seat's good for three fans that would show up anyway.  I don't want...  Here's the list.  Yeah.  I don't want Bobo there.  What?  I don't want Lady Di there.  I don't want Mary in there.  Wait a minute.  Bobo already has his ticket.  How does he got it?  How did he get a ticket?  I'm being...  He told me.  He told me he has a ticket. 
[00:07:30]  Bobo does not have a ticket.  Nobody has a ticket yet.  No one has a ticket yet.  Those guys have got to stay out.  They can join us afterwards.  I think we're going to try to get something else going.  I could join you afterwards.  Oh, thank the Lord.  Thank Jesus Christ on the cross for that one.  And I want fans there that rarely get the opportunity to hang out.  And fans that aren't going to interrupt and talk over us.  Right.  Like this.  Exactly.  This is what we're going to get.  Imagine Ronnie being...  So, you guys, 20 years...  20 years... 
[00:08:00]  Who's that?  Who's talking?  You're not going.  I'm sorry.  No.  Persona non grata.  So, Marion, you're brought up to speed a little bit.  This is Lady Di's best friend, Marion.  Why me, though?  Why wouldn't I be able to get in if I wanted to go?  I feel...  I think that you were probably categorized under the column of people who have a tendency  to interrupt and maybe aren't the quickest on picking up the vibe of the room.  You know what I mean?  I am a lot of fun to be around. 
[00:08:30]  I was just thinking that.  And I'm not a drunk.  And I don't embarrass myself, okay?  Right.  I go out and I have a little bit of fun.  And you know something?  If I can get there, I would go anyway.  I don't know.  Maybe people are offended about that N-word thing when you said it on the video.  I don't know for sure.  I don't care what they're offended of.  But let me tell you.  I say it like it is.  I tell it like it is.  Right.  And I'm going to tell you something.  I'm not that upset because I do have other things I have to take care of next Thursday.  Well, of course.  And the thing is, with Diana, she's crying and crying and crying. 
[00:09:00]  She would love to go.  We were part of the show for 20 years.  Back in the day, it was fun.  Before Diana became a full-fledged alcoholic, that was a lot of fun before that.  All right.  Well, let me...  But now it gets out of hand.  Right.  When she did the internship, she had a good time, even though I understand what happened  with the crapping and growing up and all that stuff.  Yeah, she made a mess of the bathroom and was banned from using the bathroom.  We had to take her on walks.  You guys are trying to help her get into rehab, but I'm telling you... 
[00:09:30]  A woman in her 50s.  It ain't happening, okay?  It ain't...  Or not happening.  Not with that attitude.  Let me...  Maybe this will clear things up for you.  Bobo called in after we talked to Lady Di.  Marion, you stay on the phone, and this might clear up a couple things as to how the decision-making...  How come Patty gets to go to all of these things?  She keeps her mouth shut.  Yeah, well, she doesn't talk too much.  That's why.  Oh, well, that's a good counterpoint. 
[00:10:00]  That's a very good counterpoint.  I mean, she does not talk too much.  She does not have a good time.  So why don't we hear when Bobo called in yesterday.  We'll listen together, Marion, and then maybe it'll help bring us up to speed.  What's wrong with Bobo?  I can't hear you.  Okay, let's find out.  Let's play track 17.  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, this is Bobo.  Boy, this program loves to run in circles, don't we?  Hi, Bobo.  Hi, Lady Di.  It called me a million times. 
[00:10:30]  Lady Di.  Yes.  Shut up while we talk to Bobo, okay?  Sure.  All right.  Bobo.  Hey, Bobo.  Bobo, we got something called the Bobo Rule for this unmask.  Is that cool?  It's the Bobo Rule.  We're naming it after you.  Is that cool?  It's like Megan's Law.  Right.  Something.  It's Bobo's Rule.  It's unconstitutional.  What?  The Bobo Rule is simple.  We really appreciate you guys.  It says that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays, or breaks.  Your toes are still tapping.  We support, you know, the support you guys have given us and the great radio over the 
[00:11:00]  years is terrific.  But we just feel like this event is not for you or Lady Di or Marion.  Is there anybody else in there?  Oh, come on.  Come on.  I really want a ticket to this.  Is he crying?  Bobo, are you crying?  No, but I really want a ticket to this.  Why did you tell Lady Di you already had a ticket?  Yes.  Why?  Well, I didn't know what to do.  Right?  Why'd you lie? 
[00:11:30]  How come you don't want us here?  Oh, my God.  Because you're a babbling idiot.  I wouldn't babble if you're on stage.  It's not about you.  That's true.  She behaves.  A very important...  You'd never behave at anything.  Yeah, she'd be on.  I think she'd be on.  You've never behaved at anything.  You'd be good, right, Di?  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Okay.  Jimmy said I never behaved at anything?  No, Anthony said that.  Yeah, he said that.  After all these years, you don't know the voices?  Holy fuck.  See, Marion, my only problem with... 
[00:12:00]  You're still there, right?  Yeah, I am.  My only problem with that clip is that since you're on the list of people not invited to  the Unmasked event...  Yeah, well, why me?  It makes it sound like Opie is describing you as well as a babbling idiot.  I'm not a babbling idiot, why?  Because I talk.  Right, that's...  And I like to have fun.  Uh-huh.  And the idiot thing, too.  I'm not going to stand at all these events that me and Diane went to in the past.  Right.  We had a good time.  We talked to people.  Now, I wasn't at some of these events. 
[00:12:30]  Were you a babbling idiot at the events?  I'm not a babbling idiot, but I do talk a lot.  Right.  But what am I going to do?  Stand there and not talk to people who want to come and talk to me?  Right.  I understand.  I understand.  And I don't get loaded, I don't get drunk, and I don't make a fool out of myself.  No, I've never seen you make a fool out of yourself.  But I'm going to tell you, I wish I can go, but I can't go.  But on the other hand, I'm calling for Diane, too.  Maybe you guys could call her and...  If you were planning an event, would you invite Lady Di?  No, not the way she is now. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Well, then you get our point.  Would you invite you?  Yes, I would.  That's weird.  Let me...  You know why?  Because I don't drink, okay, like she does, and I have a good time, and I talk...  I don't stand there and, like, stare into space.  Right.  It's just, you know, you talk, you hang out, you talk a lot, you're a bit of an idiot,  and so it's like, well...  A lot of blooming idiots.  Right.  You are a blooming idiot.  Okay, good point.  And you know what?  Let me tell you something.  It would be a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  People ask...  People might even ask about me and Diane.  There is a good chance that the fans are going to wonder, where is Marion? 
[00:13:30]  Actually, let's go to Snowy in Michigan.  There might be, because...  Snowy, you're on the phone on the pre-show here with myself, Sam Roberts, and Marion.  Thank you, Samuel.  It isn't about whether you guys are fun or not, or that Bobo is the fans like...  It's about Opie and Anthony.  They said she could go to the after show.  I know it's about Opie and Anthony, idiot.  But let me tell you something right now.  If Patty could be there, and Patty will just stand around and stare at people, and she won't 
[00:14:00]  even hardly talk.  So if you're at it...  I love that she's taking shots at Patty.  Talk to people.  What else do you want, Marion?  You said yourself.  You wouldn't interrupt her.  You wouldn't...  How do you...  You wouldn't take her to an event yourself.  Yeah, I've been to plenty of events in the past.  Plenty.  Plenty of events.  All right, Snowy.  Uh, Marion, Bart in Pennsylvania actually wants to talk to you.  What's up, Bart?  Hey.  Good morning, Marion.  How are you?  Good morning.  I'm good.  How are you? 
[00:14:30]  It doesn't matter how you are.  You wonder why you're not invited, because you won't shut the fuck up.  That's why.  Well, because I like to talk, and I like to have fun.  That's what it is.  That's it.  If you know something, I am not a boring person.  I don't need to get drunk to have a good time.  My question is, do Opie and Anthony even want this event to be fun at all?  They might.  Why wouldn't they?  It's 20 years.  Yeah.  And a lot.  They did a lot in 20 years.  And you've kind of been there since the beginning, huh?  Uh, well, just about, maybe. 
[00:15:00]  I'm going to tell you something, Marion.  You look great for your age.  You're still rocking that little body on you.  Yeah, well, I would love, like I said, I would love to go.  And if I can get to New York, if I can have another appointment, I would go anyway.  Yeah.  I'm sure if I went by myself, you guys would let me in.  But you know something?  I'm not going to go.  Those curves are holding up.  But I'm going to tell you something right now.  Diane is very upset.  I'm not.  But she is.  And thoughts on the passing of the Ultimate Warrior?  I don't know anything about that. 
[00:15:30]  But he, are you serious?  He did die?  He passed away last night, yes.  Holy shit, from what?  Probably from steroids?  I don't know for sure.  I don't know.  He apparently collapsed outside of his hotel in Arizona.  Holy shit.  Probably from drugs and doing too much or whatever the hell he was doing.  I got to go, Sam.  Hey, look.  Take care.  And I hope to see you soon.  I hope so, too.  But like I said.  Hey, maybe Caroline's.  You know, she's very upset.  Really.  All right.  Well.  So much with the internship two weeks ago. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  All right.  Goodbye, Marion.  We should also, I mean, if you want an example of Lady Di being upset, listen to the hang  up from yesterday's show when Opie and Anthony were finally done with Lady Di and Bobo.  You're not pleading your case as to why you should be allowed to go.  I guess we should just hang up on them.  They're not pleading their case.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Don't hang up.  I want to go.  I want to go.  I want to go.  Guys.  You know, I don't.  I'm just not feeling.  I want to go is not. 
[00:16:30]  I want to go isn't a reason.  Why don't we just hang up on these guys?  Because I'm not feeling.  Don't hang up.  No, don't hang up.  I really want to go through this.  I did not know what to say.  I have to deal with all her calls the whole time during this whole thing with Lady Di.  I have to deal with so much Lady Di drama.  I got to be honest.  I'm starting to think that maybe we should invite Lady Di.  Yeah, it's hard.  Don't do that to me.  Don't do that to me.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Both of us go together. 
[00:17:00]  No, you know what?  Now I'm not thinking Lady Di.  No.  Well, come on, man.  I'm thinking maybe Bobo should be allowed.  But he's not really pleading his case.  No, he's not doing a good job.  I am pleading my case.  I really want to go.  I've been a part of the show.  I've done so much.  I don't know why.  Now I'm going to start to cry.  You both talk through everything.  Yes.  You make it all about yourself.  You don't listen.  You babble.  I've done so much for you guys, all right?  I bet you're about to talk during this.  Sounds like a threat.  I think he's threatening us. 
[00:17:30]  I think we've got to go.  I think we've really got to go.  We've got to get ready for our Iron Sheik interview.  No, wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I think we've got to go, guys.  Yeah, I think we've got to go.  What about the ticket to the unmasked?  What about the ticket to the unmasked?  What would be the best situation?  Jimmy, it's just an utter lack of dignity.  Oh, what happened?  What happened?  The phone hung up.  Holy shit.  Oh, that was sad. 
[00:18:00]  We got lunatics.  Crazy people.  I love that they ended the call that way.  But what about the unmasked?  Like, Bobo, I think we cleared up.  Apparently, Bobo and Lady Di are not invited to the unmasked.  Marion's not either, but she said she can't go anyway, and if she could go, she would.  So, I don't think they realized that this is not going to be the type of event that you can just walk up to the door and go in.  It's kind of a hot ticket.  There's not a lot of tickets available.  Of course, if you want to be a part of it, you can enter the sweepstakes at SiriusXM.com slash unmasked. 
[00:18:30]  It's going to be an amazing, amazing show, so I would recommend that you go and enter the sweepstakes ASAP.  And then you can brag to Lady Di and Bobo that you got invited.  Let's go to Bill in Buffalo.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, it's Dale.  Hey, good morning, Sam.  Good morning.  People don't seem to realize that it's an interview unmasked.  It's not even supposed to be a party. 
[00:19:00]  It's an interview in their last 20 years, and they're letting people come to sit and sit through with it.  The enterprise should be fun, but Bobo and Lady Di just don't get it, do they?  No, and that's a good point.  It's just an interview with Opie and Anthony.  It's about them and celebrating their careers together as a radio duo.  Bobo and Lady Di are both self-obsessed people that think that this is about them, that somehow they're involved in the whole thing, and they're not. 
[00:19:30]  Larry on Rhode Island.  Hi, Sam.  Thanks for putting me on again.  You the man, buddy.  You got it.  Jim Norton tells a story about he is working before Dice, and Lady Di and Marion in the front row, and Dice is in his act, and Jimmy wants to watch Dice work, so he's just offstage watching Dice.  Well, Lady Di and Marion see Jimmy start yelling at him and waving, and he has to leave before they disrupt Dice's act.  How can he beat the unmasked?  You're right.  You're right.  You're right, Larry.  They have no concept of what these events mean and how one should behave. 
[00:20:00]  As of now, they are not invited.  We'll see how that develops.  I'm sure we'll get into it more today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Speaking of the Ultimate Warrior and wrestling, the Iron Sheik was on the show yesterday.  As if Bobo and Lady Di weren't enough, the Iron Sheik made his return to the show.  Let's hear his thoughts on Hulk Hogan.  That's track 10. 
[00:20:30]  Well, we know the Hulk, though.  Hulk Hogan has certainly shown support.  He's a jabroni.  Right.  Absolutely.  Exactly.  Because people know, without Iron Sheik, no Hulkamania.  No Hulkamania.  Exactly.  Without Sheik.  And that was that big city, never asleep, Madison Square Garden.  Madison Square Garden.  The most famous arena in the world.  Number one.  Give me hell yeah!  Hell yeah!  Oh, you all right there, Sheik?  Oh, you're okay. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  Don't get it.  Don't call me on moment here.  Stop your spilling it.  Right.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  That was good.  It's like four people in the room, and the Iron Sheik still has to steal Stone Cold's gimmick.  Give me a hell yeah!  It's not like it's a boisterous crowd.  It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, he did not disappoint yesterday. 
[00:21:30]  It's amazing what's happened with the Iron Sheik.  The first time he came on, he was totally out of his mind, drunk.  The next time he came on, he actually ended up walking out because he didn't want to do anything.  I guess he was detoxing.  Now he seems to be in a place where he's mellowed somewhat, but he's aware of what's going on around him,  and he's aware that Hulk Hogan is indeed a jabroni, because you heard him.  Anthony brought it up, and Iron Sheik said it.  Exactly! 
[00:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Let's get into it.  He's also tackling pop culture now.  Rob Ford was a topic on his mind yesterday.  Let's go to track 11.  Ian from Toronto, what do you guys think of Rob Ford?  What do I think of what the Sheik thinks?  Oh, does the Sheik have an opinion on Rob Ford?  Well, the jabroni is supposed to be the role model for the whole young generation,  but what can a fucking man just smoke crack and smoke marijuana,  and I'll go eat that jabroni hamburger. 
[00:22:30]  So, he's not really a good role model for the Toronto city.  But, to be clear, we've reached out to Rob Ford, who's going to be coming to his movie premiere in Toronto.  Oh, wow.  Of course he will.  At Hot Dogs.  We're at a headlining film in the number one film festival for documentaries.  Oh, nice.  So, at Hot Dogs, April 26th, Rob Ford and the Sheik have his...  Hot Dogs.  Oh.  They say Hot Dogs.  Hot Dogs.  I thought it was Hot Dogs, too.  Hot Dogs.  Hot Dogs. 
[00:23:00]  I thought it was just some cool restaurant or something.  It's not just hoose and a boot.  I understand.  It's a bunch of words.  We have put the invitation out, and we will be voting for Rob Ford if he does this.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  And the Sheik will give him his blessing.  And his Twitter.  He'll tweet him out.  We want the Sheik and Rob Ford on, not the red carpet, on the Persian carpet of the premiere  to come into the room on camels.  Wow.  That's the goal.  That is pretty good.  Rob Ford, we're calling you out, brother.  You need a stout camel for Rob Ford. 
[00:23:30]  He's a big fat fuck.  You're going to need him.  Exactly.  Exactly, indeed.  The Iron Sheik, right on the money.  And he's right.  And that's something that the news has never brought up in all the Rob Ford coverage.  He was, indeed, eating a jabroni hamburger.  There's no doubt about that.  That hamburger was a complete jabroni hamburger.  One more.  Of course, the Iron Sheik's thoughts on Justin Bieber.  What about Justin Bieber?  Oh, Justin Bieber, I know he's over, he has a lot of friends around the world, but still 
[00:24:00]  that young kids get a little bit too excited.  Sometimes I think he needs somebody like Iron Sheik, put him in the camel clutch, make him  humble.  Well, he's another young punk, but he did okay compared to a lot of people his age.  He has no respect.  No respect.  No respect.  No, no, no.  He needs a little discipline.  She was raised on respect.  Of course.  DNA.  Respect.  Exactly.  Amen, indeed. 
[00:24:30]  Amen, indeed.  This Lady Diane Bobo thing has the people fired up.  Let's go to Jeremy in Maryland.  Hey, man.  Yesterday I was listening to the replay, dude, and Bobo is not a scary person, but that fucker  had me scared, man.  I was like, oh my God, these thieves are laughing so fucking hard, they don't even hear you as  creepy ass on the line.  And that's what people, people, you know, they talk about Bobo and the things that have  happened to him on the show as if it's abusive.  You know, as if Opie and Anthony aren't treating him well. 
[00:25:00]  The minute that they say, Bobo, there's a show we're doing and maybe you sit this one  out, do you hear the way he sounds like his whole world is crumbling?  It's so strange.  Brandon.  Brandon in North Carolina, you're on the pre-show.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  I'm sorry to hear about the Ultimate Warrior, man.  He's a legend.  Yeah, it's awful.  But I wanted to bring it up real quick.  Bobo went behind ONA's back yesterday. 
[00:25:30]  First ten minutes of Ron and Fez, he started begging for tickets pretty much, talking about  how he did so much for the show and all this.  I just thought the guy should know that.  Didn't he pull the clip or something?  I'm glad that you called him, Brandon.  We're going to get into that today.  I'll make sure that the guys have the Bobo on Ron and Fez clip because it's like, I mean,  the whole thing, it's his whole life.  There's nothing going on outside of this thing.  Jason.  Jason in Texas, you're on the pre-show.  Hey, Sam. 
[00:26:00]  What's up?  How you doing?  All right.  Here's my suggestion.  Let Lady Di and Bobo go and give them both shock collars.  That way they start talking, you shock the shit out of them.  Maybe we'll give them shock collars and as a special gift, everybody in the audience gets  a remote.  So everybody gets the control, just shocking them all night long.  That'd be awesome.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  That's the thing, though.  We don't want a situation.  This is not like a live, wacky broadcast.  We do not want a situation where weirdos have to get electrocuted. 
[00:26:30]  We want a situation where Ron Bennington can do an in-depth, unmasked interview celebrating  the careers of Opie and Anthony.  I mean, I don't think it's too much to ask.  Speaking of celebrating, our own sex bagel was celebrating yesterday.  A big day for him.  Of course, we talked about it on the pre-show a little bit yesterday.  The other thing, before we completely move on from Lady Di, remember we were talking  about on the pre-show yesterday how difficult it is to not pick up the phone when Lady Di 
[00:27:00]  was there?  Well, because stuff like that happens.  You pick it up and you have no idea what type of disaster you're going to walk into.  But it's always entertaining on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yesterday, E-Rock was an MVP of this show.  So, the Cronut store reopened.  We talked about it with Roland a little bit on the pre-show and then again on the main  show.  But we sent E-Rock down because it became such a big media frenzy. 
[00:27:30]  All the news trucks were there, radio was there, television, everything.  And so we wanted to make sure the Opie and Anthony show was properly represented.  E-Rock used to do a lot more of these.  And one day in, I think it was probably 2004 or 2005, he ran behind a live news cast, flapping  his arms like a bird.  And at that point, for the next three years or so, Jim called him Hawk.  We wanted the return of the Hawk yesterday. 
[00:28:00]  And this is what we got.  Let's go to track two.  Dominic Ansell Bakery.  You can see it's wrapped all the way down to Thompson Street.  He was on the news reading the text. 
[00:28:30]  What a bumbling idiot.  It's so great.  As I mentioned, it's a special edition of Rocky.  Oh, let's see.  Where is he?  Just push it.  Push it.  Earlier, we talked to some people in line.  E-Rock.  We'll just grab it needed.  We'll get their hands on one of these.  Take a listen.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  Chitty boy.  That was hilarious.  There he is on 11.  On 11.  On 11.  Back to you guys.  I don't know how much excitement on this.  Oh, boy. 
[00:29:00]  Aren't they excited?  All right.  But then he ran out of shit to say.  They come as to help adults lose weight and live their bodies of harmful, toxins bust.  Our juice finds his help.  Yeah, how about he had the radio show name in there?  Oh, it really was funny.  The video of that, it's a screen grab video thing.  Obi put it up on his YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  So if you haven't seen it yet, you've got to see the visual that goes along with that broadcast.  The reason we were screaming is that he started, Fox 5 here in New York, did like a three-minute live piece from the Cronut store. 
[00:29:30]  And E-Rock was just completely oblivious to what was going on.  So he was on camera just wandering around.  And then what happened was the other station, WPIX 11, is the one that E-Rock found and shouted,  Woo, Cronut's mind.  The return of the Hawk.  The return of the Iron Sheik.  And the breakdown of Lady Di and Marion. 
[00:30:00]  It was a great Opie and Anthony show yesterday.  It's going to be an even better one today.  They're saying more new signals are coming from this Malaysian plane.  They may have found it.  But at this point, who knows what is radiating signals from the bottom of the ocean.  Of course, the UConn women's team won.  Then we'll get into the ultimate warrior and the untimely surprise passing of him.  And Reverend Al was on TV. 
[00:30:30]  We talked about him a little bit yesterday.  Justifying and explaining why he was a mob informant.  A rat, as they say.  And he's very against the no-snitching movement.  All that and a lot more when the Opie and Anthony show begins.  Which is right now.  Yeah.  And he's a temas.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Thank you. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you. 
[00:36:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You guys are all cute.  You guys are all cute.  It's hard work.  You know, we put a lot into our podcast, do you?  We've done eight podcasts already this week.  Eight.  We have.  Just this week. 
[00:36:30]  That would be two months of podcast.  That would be two months of podcast for the regular podcaster.  That would be two months of podcast for the regular podcaster.  There it is.  Upload it.  Oh, boy, are we having fun today before the show started.  We've got to get that energy right on the radio.  There's a lot of people.  There's a lot of people.  Just beating the shit out of everybody.  We really are little fucking washed women.  We just told Roland that we're saying no to all guests.  All guests.  So he's like power eating in the back right now. 
[00:37:00]  He's a little upset about that.  Oh, boy, is he?  Oh, because when you submit people to be guests on the show, he goes, oh, because just put  an automatic no in my column.  You know, sometimes the guests are great.  And sometimes it's fun to meet a big star.  But in general, sometimes it's what they call a chore.  Yeah.  Not today, though, right?  Oh, not today.  Come on.  Danny Trejo in studio.  Danny Trejo. 
[00:37:30]  And Bob Saget.  Bob Saget, friend of the show for many years.  We told Brandon Steiner to beat it.  We had too many guests today.  Did we tell him to scram?  We sure did.  Until next time.  Hit the bricks.  Take your junk and go somewhere else.  Your junk.  Does he have some Jeter stuff, being that this is his final season?  Because I need a Jeter ball because I was stupid.  Yeah.  Remember those Jeter balls that Eric Logan got for us?  Oh, yeah.  Did you ever save yours?  No.  Mine was signed to Opie Derek Jeter. 
[00:38:00]  On a baseball.  That's huge.  Mine is displayed in my house prominently.  Good for you because mine was laying around on my desk.  This stuff drives Jimmy nuts.  Oh, no.  To the point the sun completely faded out the autograph.  Oh, no.  No joke.  It is gone.  You can't even tell that he signed this ball anymore.  You know who liked mine?  Huh?  Little Beavis.  He batted it around the house.  It's adorable.  I don't.  I just, you know.  Yeah.  A few pictures of some of the guys I liked growing up. 
[00:38:30]  That's great.  Uh-huh.  She used your glass for that.  Nah.  That's all right.  It's fine.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  It's all right.  I'm sure he'll have some Jeter stuff, right?  Actually, all my stuff that I get signed, I just push on other people.  Yeah.  Because they appreciate it way more than I.  Your re-gift?  Well, it's a cool re-gift, though, right?  It is a cool re-gift.  Although, I saved my Dr. J basketball that he signed.  Oh, yeah.  Even though it's not an official ball, but that's cool.  It's one of those little basketballs. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, because that's one of the guys I watched growing up.  My God.  Dr. J was amazing.  I've got to thank the Borgata for sending me my fourth Mac Air book for fucking my birthday.  Jesus.  When's your birthday?  I should know this by now.  Is it today?  Get it.  Happy birthday.  No, it's nuts.  When's your birthday?  I know.  It's the 26th.  Happy birthday.  Thanks.  I was going to say 22nd.  I'm going to go to Caroline's on my birthday. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, boy.  To see Jimmy Norton.  Nice.  Yeah.  Well, you couldn't pick a bigger bust of a fucking birthday gift for your son.  Jesus.  That's awesome, though.  I don't know.  It's one of those things where the Borgata is very nice for doing it.  Yeah.  But it's like, how many Mac Air books do I really need?  So why don't you call those fuckers up and say, hey, change up the gifts.  Like you send me something, Windows.  Something.  Send me one of those fancy watches.  A fancy watch.  That do all that shit.  Give it a watch. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're nice.  So we got Bob Saget.  Yeah.  Did you know that on TV he was like a family sitcom guy?  Yeah.  But in his real life he's kind of dirty?  I didn't know that.  Perhaps we can chit-chat about that.  Did you know that?  I didn't know that.  I was actually.  Unlike you guys, I was aware of that.  Because I saw him as this squeaky clean guy.  I was a bit surprised to find out that in his real life he was dirty. 
[00:40:30]  Wow.  Because he was so clean for TV.  You know, I bet people go there thinking they're going to see the clean guy from the TV show.  And then they're shocked maybe.  Right.  You know, this may be an angle that you guys want to take with the interview today.  I hope that's in our prep.  I'm thinking that we should do that for the fifth time.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Please don't be listening. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, boy.  We love Bob Saget.  You know that.  Of course we do.  That's obvious.  And the name of his book is called Dirty Daddy.  Oh.  How nice is that?  We better be in this book.  I'm telling you right now.  Oh, what?  I'll check the thank you.  I'm searching for our names right now.  There's no thank you section.  Oh, really?  No, no thank you section.  So he covertly hides it within the text of the book.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, you know, and boy, did this guy help me.  And then we're just pieces of shit again. 
[00:41:30]  Who knows?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I love that.  I'm a big fan of you guys.  And then they go and thank everyone else in their book.  Thank you.  Whatever.  I'm not saying Bob Saget did that.  Thank you.  He truly is the king of all men.  Oh, we get it.  Thanks.  Thanks for the thank you.  Is he really?  We get nothing.  When people put their little dumb thank yous.  Is he really?  Can't take a little ribbing from Jeff Van Gundy?  What happened there?  I think the king of all media should be able to take a little ribbing from Jeff Van Dundy. 
[00:42:00]  The king of all paranoids.  Right.  Poor Jeff Van Gundy is holding on to the last piece of hair on his head.  And you're going after him because he ribbed you a little bit for leaving a Knicks game early.  So why don't you just send him to your wig place?  Right.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Call him a midget and all this stuff.  Really?  Can't take it?  Come on.  The king of dishing it out can't take a little ribbing from a guy that doesn't even have  a hint of a muscle on his body. 
[00:42:30]  Fuck.  Really?  What else is going on?  Did you hear my text?  I texted you last night.  Oh, dude.  I meant to write you back.  Yeah.  I was in a restaurant in Phil Jackson.  Dick pics?  What was that?  No.  That's obvious.  He's seen enough of those.  Damn.  Nice.  He was in a...  Jimmy, I don't know what happened because I honestly got very excited by that text and  I meant to write you back.  For real.  Sitting right behind me.  What restaurant?  I'll tell you off the air because he might go there a lot.  Phil Jackson.  Oh, Phil Jackson.  I'm a huge Phil Jackson fan. 
[00:43:00]  Huge.  Yes.  Even when he was with the Lakers, I had to kind of push for him a little bit because  of, you know, the Knicks angle.  Sure.  He's a big man.  Yeah.  And he's square.  Yeah.  You notice that?  Broad fucking shoulders.  Really square looking.  Oh, I thought you meant he was just uncool.  No.  The shape.  His shoulders, like Jimmy said, it's ridiculous how wide he is.  Like a cartoon version of a man.  Yeah.  I looked at...  I didn't stare at him.  I just saw him briefly in the mirror and I was like, that's the guy that coached Jordan 
[00:43:30]  and Shaquille and Colby.  Like, man, he really is a great fucking coach.  But I'm the one...  I think of it this way.  He's the guy that played with Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusher.  Dave DeBusher.  Willis Reed.  I remember being a kid and my dad was a huge Knicks fan and I would hear the game as I  was going to bed and I thought Dave DeBusher was a butcher.  Dave the Butcher, yes.  I always thought for so long, why is a butcher playing basketball?  I thought it was Dave the Butcher, too. 
[00:44:00]  I was just that tiny, tiny little nobody.  Oh.  Child of the 80s.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I figured it out.  Yeah.  But Phil Jackson, man, that left-handed, awkward-looking fella was able to play the game as well.  People don't know that.  He was good, man.  He was in the starting lineup for the Knicks.  I don't know him as a player at all.  I just...  I remember he was here one day with...  Before the other Knicks, they were doing some fishbowl thing.  Right.  You got that picture, too, right?  Yeah, five of them.  And they all signed a ball. 
[00:44:30]  That's awesome.  Yeah.  I remember you got that picture.  See, something like that...  You know, I'm not unreasonable.  A picture like that I would love and I would frame.  Yeah.  But most of the stuff, who cares?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Mars.  Mars.  Mars.  What happened?  New to broadcast?  Drug deal going down.  Drug deal going down.  That's when he's supposed to wake up.  Oh, you got to meet someone in the bathroom for a little drug deal.  Oh, exactly.  Making some side money.  He's got a pager in 2014. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, boy.  This is a story out of...  Maybe I shouldn't say.  Oh.  What's it about?  I better not say.  Oh.  Because I don't know if it hit the papers yet.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at the man fucking in the news.  Some drug dealing going on in a hospital in the Philly area.  Oh, yeah?  That's why I just said exactly what I said.  It's based on something.  I hear a lot of drugs going on in the hospitals.  Supposedly there's some dealing going on in the bathroom.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  A whole system...  A whole system of meet me in the bathroom. 
[00:45:30]  I got a little something-something for it.  Ah.  Anyway.  Nice.  More of that will come out soon, I'm sure.  By the way, Mickey Rooney was worth $18,000.  I saw that.  That's it?  And he said...  That poor fuck.  He gave a big fuck you to his eight kids.  He took all his kids...  But whatever.  What are you going to give?  18 grand?  He took all his kids out of his will very recently.  Because he knew he was on his last leg and said, you know what?  This is what I'm going to do.  He had nothing.  And he gave the $18,000 to his stepson that was kind of taking care of him at the end there. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, boy.  $18,000.  And it was another stepson that fucked up his fortune.  Yeah, that's the one...  I think he filed elder abuse against that guy.  Yeah.  Right.  And the same guy?  I'm guessing it was.  I don't know.  He was always bitching about the fact that he never made money.  Oh.  All the movies that he made.  He said...  You know, it was back in the day where they never paid those guys.  Right.  You know?  They made the movies.  They made a flat rate.  And that was it.  And it wasn't that much money. 
[00:46:30]  You would think Mickey Rooney was worth at least a mil.  Right.  Yeah.  Come on.  18 G's.  Wow.  18 G's.  How was he living?  That's chump change.  Was he living on someone's couch?  You know, it's a lot of money and a lot of people.  All right.  Wow.  He disinherited his estranged wife of 35 years.  That fucking photo-blocking, clover-filled monster.  Oh, my God.  Some of those pictures that people redid were great.  My favorite was the one with just a brick wall. 
[00:47:00]  Someone just put an awkward brick wall in.  Yeah, right on, man.  Wow.  Yeah, those guys got so screwed back in those days.  Not just the athletes.  They really got screwed up.  Right.  You know when he made it up in?  Pussy.  That short little fuck would have never gotten laid.  That's true.  And he fucked some quality Hollywood fucking quiff.  What was the quality?  Name names.  Ava Gardner.  Ava, that's quality. 
[00:47:30]  Ava Gardner right there.  Back in the day, that was some quality.  Quality pussy.  Wasn't that Merv's beard?  Was it?  I think Sinatra fucked Ava Gardner, too.  Really?  Right?  Oh, I was thinking Gabor.  Wasn't there an Ava Gabor or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gabor was the one that Merv walked around with.  But he got Hollywood starlet pussy that he never would have gotten.  So, you know.  Yeah.  You gotta take it where you can get it.  Maybe not in green cash, but in the old pink gash.  Oh! 
[00:48:00]  But he was only worth $18,000.  It's said that there was some kind of a settlement he got that millions were owed to him, but  they probably said he probably never would have collected.  That's what you gotta do, though.  He wins.  He's Mickey Rooney.  He has this long life where, you know, he probably didn't want for anything in his life.  Right.  And then he dies with barely any money.  That's the goal, right?  Yeah, of course.  Especially if you don't want to give your heirs any money.  You went through your money.  You used it all.  Unless you want people who love you at the end.  Yeah, fuck them. 
[00:48:30]  Maybe that one he missed on.  Fuck them in the ass.  Maybe he was just a horrible person, though.  He comes across like he was a real prick on wheels.  I'm saying maybe.  You know, on paper it sounds awful, but maybe he was just a dick.  You don't go through eight wives being terrific.  As much as we like Larry King, there's seven people who will say he's a cunt.  Right.  Right.  Did you know that Bob Saget's a dirty daddy?  You know what?  I just saw that on his book cover, and perhaps we should take that angle.  It says the chronicles of a family man turned filthy comedian. 
[00:49:00]  That's an angle we've got to take today, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good idea.  We'll get to the bottom of some stuff finally.  Right.  Sam, who makes believe he's in the know, doesn't even understand that the ultimate warrior is  going to die soon.  He doesn't get the last interview.  You blew it, sir.  Yes, you did.  I didn't have that option.  Weren't you down there with the wrestlers just a mere two days ago?  Yeah, with the warrior.  How close were you to the warrior?  I mean, I never, I wasn't any closer than seeing him on the stage. 
[00:49:30]  Oh.  How did he look?  He looked great.  Oh, boy.  And I'll tell you this.  I see he was a nice man.  I saw him in August.  I heard he was a jabroni, though.  I disagree with the Iron Sheik's assessment.  Didn't he say that just yesterday, that he was a jabroni?  And then on that post-show.  Why does that work out that way with us on this show?  On the post-show, Iron Sheik said the ultimate warrior was a male prostitute.  Well, obviously the warrior couldn't take that news.  Right. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  Yeah.  But I saw, I talked to him last in August, and you know what he said to me when he saw  me?  What?  He went like this.  Sam, what's the haps?  All right.  The ultimate warrior said that?  Yes, it was one of the coolest things that's ever happened.  No shit.  Probably the last thing he said before he died.  Oh.  He just yelled, Sam, what's the haps?  What's the haps?  Grabbed his chest and fell on the floor.  Poor guy.  Yeah, that's going to turn out to be a heart blowing out.  Yeah.  That's got to be a heart blowing out.  I bet he did a lot of steroids in his day.  Right?  I mean, that was the steroid era. 
[00:50:30]  That's not him, is it?  That's him.  And what was this clip from?  It doesn't look like him.  This was from two days ago.  This was from Monday.  Holy shit.  He was in the ring on Monday?  He cut a promo on Monday.  Oh, wow.  So let's listen to this.  This was the first time he was on Raw in well over ten years.  I mean, wow.  So he was getting his, they were going to give him a little taste.  Yeah, he said he signed like an ambassador's deal, which means he gets new merchandising  and they sent him on autograph signings. 
[00:51:00]  Didn't he bash them relentlessly or no?  He bashed them, but they also bashed him.  It's one of those things.  Let's hear this.  Oh, wait.  First, the clip from yesterday.  Iron Sheik talking about The Ultimate Warrior.  I didn't shake.  This is the after show clip.  How long is it?  It's two minutes.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Can we play 20 seconds?  You can bow out at any time.  Okay.  Let's get to the meat of it.  Yeah, please.  You take a lot of pride in the fact that you're a Hall of Fame member, correct?  Right.  How did you feel over the weekend watching The Ultimate Warrior become a member of the 
[00:51:30]  Hall of Fame?  Because that kind of means the Iron Sheik and The Ultimate Warrior, same level.  Well, not really same level.  Iron Sheik class is higher because, like I said, I'm already All-American AAU champion.  Right.  And that jabroni never had in my class.  And I'm the real WWE champion. 
[00:52:00]  Hulk Hogan, I mean, The Ultimate Warrior, gave a lot of bad names because it was embarrassing  for Bruno Sammartino, Hulk Hogan, or myself to be.  They found out that guy is a sell himself for the sex, for the money.  Yeah.  He was a kind of male prostitute.  Was he a male prostitute?  Exactly.  He was a male prostitute.  Male prostitute.  That was embarrassing for the WWE company and all the top wrestlers. 
[00:52:30]  So after that, he lost his respect next to me.  I didn't care about him.  So you don't think he should be in the Hall of Fame?  Well, I have.  But the president said they don't care about the gay people.  Oh, shit.  Gays are allowed into the WWE Hall of Fame.  Is that an Obama thing?  Obama says, yeah, gays can get married and Vince McMahon.  Is there any evidence that The Ultimate Warrior is actually a male prostitute? 
[00:53:00]  Well, that was in the Enquirer magazine.  Oh.  That's why I read in the Enquirer.  If it's in the Enquirer, you know, it's 100% true.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, it would seem that way.  Yeah, I didn't mix that story.  There wasn't that mixing.  Enquirer magazine, not just I know.  Everybody in America did the body.  So to be clear, it's the sheik's, it's his rules and what the Enquirer says is what he lives by.  Right.  I understand that. 
[00:53:30]  Fair enough, I think.  I think so, too.  He's old enough where he can just say whatever he wants.  He don't care.  He's got a free pass.  Those guys didn't jump in enough.  Yeah.  The Intelligent Jews.  I cut them out of our group picture.  Did you?  I left one eye just to make it really hurt.  Good man.  Good man.  Yeah, but you did it subtly.  You didn't mention in the caption that you cut them out, did you?  What did I write?  I forget already.  I think you wrote something to the effect of, I cut out the two jabronis that came with the iron cheese.  Yeah.  The jabronis.  Look, though. 
[00:54:00]  You can see his one eye.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just to make it really hurt.  Good.  And the picture's off-centered.  Off-centered because of that.  So they're saying the Ultimate Warrior was walking outside a hotel in Arizona.  Why Arizona?  That's where he's from, I guess?  Yeah.  And walking outside with his wife when he collapsed.  That's not good.  That means a heart blew out.  His heart blew out.  Yeah, he was at the Hall of Fame on Saturday. 
[00:54:30]  He was at WrestleMania on Sunday.  And then he cut a for real in-ring promo.  Can we hear it?  On Monday.  Were people happy to see him in the ring?  They were.  And he put the duster on and everything.  People are not happy with the wrestling talk on our show.  No, they're not.  I read some tweets.  They don't like it, huh?  Too much.  They tune right out is what I hear.  A little more than usual because of the WrestleMania thing.  And the return of the Iron Sheik.  Right.  We'll go back to not giving a fuck soon. 
[00:55:00]  Relax.  But now we have to play this clip because the guy just died.  He died.  A day later after cutting this.  How long is this, though?  Two minutes.  Jesus.  Enough of the two minutes.  Well, he's not going to come out on Raw and do 15 seconds.  Yeah.  Well, couldn't we just cut up this?  I mean, because we cut off it and then you'd say, well, what about the rest of it?  And then I'd find the video anyway.  Not when it comes to wrestling clubs.  We'd just hear the beginning.  Just to hear his voice.  Yeah.  You'll talk over it.  It'll be fine.  You'll be all right. 
[00:55:30]  That's true.  Oh.  I actually loved this guy when he was wrestling.  He was great.  Warrior says.  Yeah.  Where's his makeup?  As I thought about what I was going to say this evening, it's been hard for me.  Could you pause?  He looks a little pasty.  He looks like he's ready to die.  He doesn't look good. 
[00:56:00]  I mean, he seems to say that now, but he doesn't look good.  He's got horrible flop sweat.  His skin is pasty.  He did not run.  He's sweaty.  You know what I mean?  He's hard.  He's catching a breath.  Right.  Yeah.  I remember watching this and thinking, this guy's not looking too good.  Right.  Oh, boy.  He looks all right, but when it's a video, you can tell that there's some issues there.  Plus, once somebody died $12 later, you can look back at videos and go, yeah, he'll look  right there.  Right.  But look at the sweat.  Yeah.  That's a lot of sweat.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  He also has a big duster on over a three-piece suit.  Why is he doing that?  Because the Ultimate Warrior wore a duster.  Did he?  What's a duster?  It's like that jacket with the paint on it.  I just remember wearing the makeup and then the crazy outfits.  With the big muscles.  Oh, yeah.  Remember when trench coats were popular?  The long fucking leather trench.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A girl I dated years ago wanted a leather trench for Christmas.  Really?  Yeah.  Wait, she wanted one?  Yeah.  Huh.  A lot of people saying he couldn't breathe. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  I mean, yeah, he was definitely blown up.  When he went into the ring, he couldn't breathe.  Yeah, but he was always blown up.  That was the thing.  He could never breathe.  I've never seen a promo where the Ultimate Warrior is not out of breath.  He was 54 only.  Yes.  Although that's like old age for wrestlers.  Oh, man.  Well, I think if you make it to 50 as a wrestler, that's old age.  Reset the clock, huh?  Yeah.  How old was he?  He made it over the hump.  He's how old?  72.  Is he really?  Wow.  Yeah.  43. 
[00:57:30]  Huh?  He's only kidding.  Oh, right.  Oh.  Think of what Warrior does here.  Poor Warrior.  What did he pull out of his pocket?  His old mask.  Nitroglycerin.  Oh, God.  He's got an Ultimate Warrior face paint mask that they started selling, by the way.  They just started selling.  Yeah, there he goes.  There you go.  There's the Warrior.  Put the mask on.  Oh.  Well, then.  You shut up, Warrior, and let me do the talking. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, you shut up, Warrior, but he is the Warrior.  His real name is Warrior.  Yes.  He changed his name legally.  Oh, boy.  So that his first and last, it's just Warrior.  Why would he say, you shut up, Warrior, I'm going to do the talking?  Because that's the ultimate Warrior.  He's the ultimate Warrior, so he's telling Warrior, who's just the guy.  You don't know that.  I don't know.  I mean, I would, but I'm a little deep inside, I think.  Yeah, you certainly are.  But wouldn't it have been a better bit if he used his old real name? 
[00:58:30]  No, his name is...  What is it again?  James or something?  Jim Helwig.  So why...  He should have said...  Because that's not his name.  James, you shut up.  I'm going to talk now.  Right, right.  His name is not James, and he got offended when people called him James.  He was referred to only as Warrior.  All right, continue.  He sounds like Edgar.  Yeah, a little bit.  No WWE talent becomes a legend on their own. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, boy.  Every man's heart one day beats.  It's final beat.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  And what that man did in his life makes the blood pulse through the body of others.  It makes them bleed deeper in something than larger than life.  This makes you yearn for Mr. T's speech.  Jesus.  You don't think this is good?  He's got his mother's bladder. 
[00:59:30]  He's eulogizing himself.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he knew.  And make the running the man did live forever.  You, you, you, you, you, you, you are the legend makers of Ultimate Warrior.  Oh.  He's eulogizing himself right there.  Yeah.  Kind of creepy.  That's fucked up.  In hindsight, maybe you shouldn't have worn the fucking mask. 
[01:00:00]  Take some of them with warrior spirits and you will do the same for them.  You will decide if they lived with a passion and intensity.  So much so that you will tell your stories and you will make them much as well.  Mask is creeping up on his face.  His eyes look a little crazy.  I am Ultimate Warrior.  Oh, he's huffing and puffing. 
[01:00:30]  Here.  Jesus.  There it is.  A little eulogy for himself.  Very nice.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  We could cut that part out so it's less than two minutes.  Yeah.  Wow.  We're in the Hall of Fame.  You know who he's fighting with today?  Who?  The Undertaker.  You know, get it?  Get it?  That's the way.  Fuck. 
[01:01:00]  Poor guy.  That's terrible.  That broke overnight.  Ultimate Warrior.  Dead at 54.  Yeah.  That's just crazy.  Yeah, they just filmed, like, a whole bunch of interviews with him over the weekend for  new projects and stuff that they were going to do.  Yeah.  I'm sure they'll still put out a DVD and all that.  Why not?  Vince is jerking off somewhere.  I don't know about that.  The Warrior merch is going to sell really well now because of this.  Just send those masks back to the printer to have two X's put over the eyes. 
[01:01:30]  And then you put that on and it's like X's on the eyes, right?  Like a cartoon.  Right?  Unnecessary.  Who's unforgivable, do you think, in wrestling?  Because he seems to take anybody back.  He's terrible.  Who's impossible to take back?  A prick on wheels.  I guess Macho Man because he died before they forgave him.  But I don't think there's anybody.  At the end of the day, there's money to be made, so.  Look at that.  That was just a day or two ago.  I am. 
[01:02:00]  Vince McMahon and the Ultimate Warrior embracing.  Look at the Ultimate Warrior's face.  It's a shade of purple I've never seen.  Wow.  Yeah.  Nice set of choppers, though.  That's horrible.  Good full head of hair, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, poor fucker.  Probably had rage issues.  I bet he did.  He had a nice family.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Loved his daughters.  A couple daughters, right?  Young.  Like, uh, probably pre-teen-ish.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  What?  His daughters? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Push them up.  What do you see?  See some pictures.  No.  I couldn't be more disrespectful.  I'm here to help.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You see Sean Penn's daughter in the paper today?  Wow.  I've seen his daughter.  Oh, my God.  But she's naked in the paper today.  What?  Yeah.  Punch that up.  Stat.  Dylan Francis Penn.  Sean Penn's daughter is naked.  She's going into the business.  Come on.  Stop.  What?  It's right in your paper.  I don't have the time.  It's right next to me. 
[01:03:00]  I was hoping to get the color picture from the fucking, uh, intertubes.  What is it?  Post or Dylan?  I don't say post.  Post is the dirtier of the two.  Whoa!  There you go.  Man.  There you go.  All right.  Wow.  She's quite lovely.  She's showing some skin.  And that's with, uh, who?  Robin Wright Penn?  Yep.  She looks like Scarlett Johansson on her face.  It's a little bit.  She's beautiful.  Wow.  Is she pretty?  I bet she's got a fiery red bush.  It looks a little fiery. 
[01:03:30]  Does it?  I love that fiery bush.  I love a good fiery red bush.  I don't know why.  Let me see that.  Because it's an anomaly, I think.  I think because it's so rare.  Yeah.  You don't see them at all.  Yeah.  Even girls with red hair sometimes, it's like, ah, the bush is brown.  What happened?  That girl on Game of Thrones is a redhead.  She's really hot.  Oh, I bet that's a fiery red bush.  Yeah.  If you shave your bush, if you have red hair, you're just, you're, you're, you're cheating  men out of the wonderfulness of seeing that. 
[01:04:00]  You know, the little pubis over, it's all freckled, freckled.  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  I like that.  I don't need that.  Roland's, um, getting with, Roland's getting with the times.  He just posted his picture with the ultimate warrior.  Oh, God.  Roland always has to be right there.  Mr. High five on the subway.  Yeah.  He's right on it.  I'm surprised he didn't wear his ultimate warrior t-shirt for a day or two.  Yeah.  It's, he's probably on order.  He'll probably come in here with the mask tomorrow.  The mask.  What is his deal? 
[01:04:30]  He does this so he can talk to people on the subway?  Yeah.  He likes, no, he likes to, he doesn't even need to talk to people.  He just likes high fives on the subway.  Right.  So he'll, he'll, whatever, whatever's hot in pop culture or sports.  Yeah, he was a part of Lynn's sanity.  He was part of Lynn's sanity, even though he didn't watch one game.  No, he had the Jets Tim Tebow t-shirt.  Right.  But for way before Tebow was actually on the field.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just about getting onto a subway and getting a nice high five for himself.  I see.  I see. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that, that's all there is.  He has no loyalty to anything.  No.  Except for, he's loyal to the high five.  Yeah.  That's it.  He's a fan of the high five.  He loves it.  Good for him.  That's cool.  He didn't even watch wrestling.  Why has he got a photo with the Ultimate Warrior for?  I don't know.  Well, because it's hot right now.  It's hot.  And that's the other, that's the other evilness about him.  The only reason he even has the photo with the Ultimate Warrior is because when we met him  the first time, E-Rock was not with us.  Right.  And so he wanted to be able to text Eric a photo with a wrestler that Eric didn't have. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, that's what it is.  Just evil.  Yeah, Roland.  All right, we got food.  Why don't we take a break?  Ooh.  We got to talk about Reverend Al after the break.  He's a fucking rat.  Whole family rat.  Got to talk about the naked bra at McDonald's.  I love that video.  I just love the commentary.  I love her giant fat tits.  Can we cut?  Nah.  We'll play the whole thing.  Screw it.  We might as well.  And there was something else.  Oh, the old age home thing. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  With the 85, 86-year-old lady that got a lap dance.  Yeah.  Her son's very angry.  Extremely angry.  Yeah.  But he brought this upon himself.  He certainly did.  In a way.  Yes, I agree.  We'll explain next.  Hopi and Anthony will be right back.  You got me right where you want to be.  On a Sirius XM.  If you'll be in the New York City area.

Kinda knows how to play a guitar.  What do you think?  The words.  Look back.  Not in this version.  I hate these fucking rejoiners.  What?  Regular radio shit.  He's rejoiners with no words to them.  It's all right.  I like you both.  I think the song doesn't have any words.  Yeah, it does.  It's a great song.

[01:18:30]  Hey, listen, guys.  Oh.  Yep.  I'm punching out.  Yeah.  Now that's a punch out, see?  That was good.  That's when the guy says, I'm punching out, and it makes sense.  Right.  Because your craft is going in.  Your plane is crashing.  Right.  He understood it.  You've got to punch out.  Before we're searching for the pinks.  Right.  The pinks.  If she was taking care of you, Sonny, would you need Leon?  Would you need a man?  We're going to answer when the mother's pleading with him. 
[01:19:00]  He's standing out in front of the bank talking to his mother.  There's 500 cops, and there's hostages in the bank, and his mother goes, run.  He's like, Bob, where am I going to run to?  Run.  I love that.  That's such a mother desperation moment.  What a great movie, too.  I've got to put that on my list.  Yeah, man.  I haven't seen that one in a while.  That's a damn good movie.  Yep.  Bob Saget is coming in.  Yes.  This book is called Dirty Dad.  He's finally letting the world know, Anthony, that not only is he a family man, he's also 
[01:19:30]  a filthy comedian.  I did not know this.  So we're going to take that angle today with our friend.  These are the uncorrected proofs, by the way.  What do you mean?  I am.  These are not the actual books.  They are, but I was going to say, it's kind of a, you know, the paper's a little cheap.  Yeah.  Uncorrected proof.  It says it right on.  Right on the cover.  Not for sale.  Cool.  Which means I'm going to get Bob to sign it, and I sell it.  That's right.  Uncorrected.  It could be worth something.  A picture with Rodney Dangerfield in here.  Yeah.  I like a good uncorrected proof.  A picture with Don Rickles. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's got a picture with Louie, too.  He knows some guys, huh?  Yeah.  Let's see.  A picture with, oh, a picture with Stamos.  Oh, is Reverend Al trying to fucking backpedal?  Is he?  Is he trying to save his ass?  Well, when you've seen every bill, and now...  Oh, shut up.  Oh, is he...  Why is he on...  Who likes this guy?  MSNBC.  Especially for TV.  Yeah.  He might like what he does for the community or whatever, but he's not likable as far as 
[01:20:30]  watching him on TV.  And the way they take him seriously and listen to him, ugh.  That he's able to get an audience with the President of the United States is an embarrassment.  It's an embarrassment.  Mr. Kuma, I completely agree with you.  Thank you, Mr. Hughes.  I absolutely agree with you on that.  Yes.  I think that's pretty pathetic.  It is embarrassing.  Do you think George W. would have given him the time of day?  Even William Jefferson Clinton, I don't believe, gave Reverend Al the time of day. 
[01:21:00]  But, of course, Barack Hussein Obama gives him...  What are they saying today with the Reverend Al?  Reverend Al's saying what?  He's a fucking rat.  But Reverend Al says he's a cat.  Oh, wow.  That's clever.  Yeah.  He's not a rat.  He's a cat.  Black leaders like to rhyme.  That's what I've noticed.  So, I'm not a rat.  I'm a cat.  And then the Post says...  You can figure...  You know.  The Post has that quote, I'm not a rat, I'm a cat.  And then right under it, it says, Big Pussy. 
[01:21:30]  Big Pussy.  You know what that means.  Yes.  You know what a pussy means, right?  Yeah.  And also, Big Pussy, who is a rat for the Sopranos.  Oh!  You think they might have been going for that?  Yeah.  Well, that's why they felt like they could get away with it.  Because they're basically calling him a pussy.  Yeah.  Which is a bad word in our new society.  Al all full of himself over mob takedown.  But it all is also Big Pussy is like cat.  That ties in beautifully.  Of course.  They were able to say...  But they're saying he's a pussy.  Yeah.  And they're right. 
[01:22:00]  What is he saying, though, Ant?  He's saying the story was blown way out of proportion.  He was being threatened by somebody in the mob and decided to work with the FBI to get this guy off his back.  But other people in the FBI and whatnot are saying that, no.  So, he was up on some type of drug charge.  Really?  And in order to get out of that, he cooperated with the FBI and used a recording device. 
[01:22:30]  And that's the reason he was a rat.  So, what the real story is at this point, who the fuck knows?  But I'm willing to believe that Reverend Al would do anything to keep his stature in the community and get himself out of a jam.  The full quote was, I was not and am not a rat because I wasn't with the rats, he said.  I'm a cat.  I chase rats.  I don't believe it.  I think he was in a little Dutch and decided to work with the FBI. 
[01:23:00]  Because you don't just work with the FBI.  If you're being threatened by someone in the mob, you go through the proper channels to, I guess, resolve that problem.  You don't start working with the FBI to, no one starts working with the FBI unless they're jammed up and need to get out of trouble.  Unless the FBI has something.  Right.  Absolutely.  No one just decides to work, decides out of the fucking blue to work with the FBI. 
[01:23:30]  De Blasio, the mayor of New York City.  De Blasio, that's what I call him.  He's blousy.  It's kind of in there.  A little bit.  He says, doesn't change the relationship one bit.  I'm very proud to be his friend.  You're an idiot.  I think he has done a lot of good for the city of New York and this country.  God, I hate De Blasio.  That fucking douchebag De Blasio.  His approval ratings are horrendous already. 
[01:24:00]  He's talking up, Reverend Al.  There is nothing a black person can do that De Blasio won't just fucking fawn over and adore.  And adore.  Oh, God.  You don't have to like every black person.  Reverend Al has been a scumbag in his life.  He's a scumbag.  Fuck.  Well, De Blasio continues.  What's obvious from what he said this very morning is that he was asked by the FBI to support their efforts,  and he agreed to help.  And that's what a citizen should do, De Blasio said. 
[01:24:30]  I have his picture.  That's crazy.  That's a stretch.  I'm going to my commission.  Now I've been on fire.  Look, they're all chuckling with a...  Remember that picture, Al?  Thank you, Reverend.  Happy birthday.  When you were accusing police officers of rape?  Remember that?  When you were fucking inciting riots against Jews?  Remember that?  He was just chasing rats, man.  Oh, Christ almighty.  He's a cat chasing the rats.  That guy's a fucking rat. 
[01:25:00]  Let's see.  Support.  He agreed to help, and that's what citizens should do, De Blasio said.  The smoking gun reported, as other news organizations have in the past,  that Sharpton became an informant after he was caught on a video nodding along as a drug kingpin discussed cocaine deals.  His cooperation allegedly prevented the possibility that he would be charged.  Exactly.  So...  What a piece of shit.  Uh, you got, uh, this, uh, Bistone. 
[01:25:30]  He's the author of the smoking gun story.  Bistone says the idea that he made the recordings because this guy supposedly threatened him, it's just totally crazy.  Exactly.  He may not like, uh, he may not like considering himself a confidential informant, but that's what he was.  He wasn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart.  Of course not.  Joe Bistone, that's the guy from, um, Donnie Brusco.  Donnie Brusco.  William Bistone.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  From the smoking gun.  Oh.  Oh.  Ah, of course.  Sharpton cast a new attention on his work with the feds as anyone? 
[01:26:00]  Um, he's outraged.  What?  Uh.  Sharpton cast a new attention on his work with the feds as...  Littering and...  Littering and...  Littering and...  Racism.  Racist.  Ah!  He said that while blacks who have helped law enforcement are called snitches, we make  heroes in other communities who fight crime.  Is that it? 
[01:26:30]  First of all, black people never snitch.  It's one of the biggest problems in the community.  Cops come in.  They say, do you see anything?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I ain't seen nothing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I saw a video the other day of two women brawling...  Oh, actually four women brawling in a fast food place.  It's great.  You know, world stars fucking...  These guys are just yelling, world star, world star, world star.  And the guy looks at a pocketbook on the floor and he just says, who bag? 
[01:27:00]  Who bag?  Who bag?  Like he wanted to convey, whose bag is this?  That's what he wanted to convey.  Whose bag is this?  Whose bag?  Who belongs to this bag?  And he just goes, who bag?  Who bag?  Now, does that...  I don't know why that's accepted.  Does that infuriate you or make you laugh?  It just makes me laugh.  It does make me laugh.  Who bag makes me laugh.  It does make me laugh a lot.  Tell who kid we got his new name.  Who bag?  Who bag? 
[01:27:30]  Who bag?  Who bag?  That's where the goo comes from.  Who bag?  Who bag?  Who bag?  That's where the moisture comes from.  Yeah, that's what he uses to take care of the moisture.  Greatest Instagram account ever.  Who kid from around the world.  I don't know why that's accepted as some form of English.  I don't want to lose this guy.  A lot of times this shit is bullshit.  But let's see.  Let's just see today.  Gary in Georgia.  Go ahead, Gary.  Hey there, fellas.  Anyway, I got a neighbor down here. 
[01:28:00]  She's kind of a scumbag.  I'm a scumbag, but anyway, she's got some info, she says, coming out about Al Sharpen this week.  And the thing she's told me before, check out where she was with the James Brown camp here in Georgia.  And, of course, to go backwards in the story, she claims that there was a rape involved with James Brown and things like that.  You can check some of her story out on the internet.  Yeah.  But, anyways, the story she says she has coming out is a certain type of videotape that features Mr. Sharpen as a star. 
[01:28:30]  Oh.  Sex tape?  The same type of, what's that, I'm sorry?  Sex tape?  That's what she says.  That's what she's saying.  Like I said, a lot of times this is BS.  That's crap.  But we'll see.  Now, she showed another neighbor of mine.  My other neighbor said, that's true.  Now, I didn't see the tape, so I can't tell.  Why wouldn't she show you the tape?  Yeah, exactly.  All this vagueness always.  I heard someone had the tape, but they fell out of the closet and threw up on it, and then the tape broke. 
[01:29:00]  That's what I heard.  Tucker Max.  That's exactly.  Shut up.  I will never get over that liar.  Never.  In my humble opinion, that liar.  Pants on fire.  Ugh.  I'm a douche.  Book publishers bought into his bullshit.  Please.  Yeah, I don't care.  No.  Book publishers don't give a shit.  Good point.  All right, Gary, we'll see.  We'll see if you're right.  I don't know.  When is this all happening?  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Watch, it's vague.  Well, it's going to be Friday.  Then Friday comes.  Well, you know.  Exactly.  She had to get on a plane for business, and now it's going to be Monday.  Yellen.  Yeah, I don't doubt that that's the fact at all.  It's the fact, Jack.  It comes across that way.  But she says the other star in the film is none other than James Brown's former, you know, his wife at the time.  Oh, so Reverend Al is supposedly banging James Brown's wife? 
[01:30:00]  In this video?  Was.  This was back in the 80s.  So why would this be any kind of a scandal for Reverend Al?  Was he married at the time?  I don't know.  Who cares?  I just lost interest.  I just immediately lost interest.  I got to tell you, I think it's all bullshit.  Yeah.  I think it could be, and I feel like a dickhead.  No, that's all right.  Well, you should.  You can be a hero in a few days if this actually pops.  Hey, if it is, I can put you, if it's true, I can put you in touch with the lady who is there.  How about you put us in touch with her now?  Yeah, what do you wait for? 
[01:30:30]  Put us in touch with her now.  This is what I'm talking about.  Everything's always vague and might happen in the future.  Sometime.  Sometime.  Hold on.  He said he'll give us a number.  He'll give us a number off air?  Yeah, I'll give it to you.  She gave it to me.  In fact, I told her, I was like, look, I know these guys who would probably love it.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  You don't know these guys, but I know of these guys who would like you.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  You know a version of me.  I know of you.  All right. 
[01:31:00]  Fair enough.  Aversion.  Yeah, hold on.  It's a version of me.  It's a cat.  You think I act like this all day long?  It'd be exhausting.  Totally exhausting to be like this all day.  Holy shit.  All I want to do when I get home is shut up.  Right.  I don't fucking.  I really don't even want to fucking talk.  Yeah.  People around me get frustrated.  The rest of the day, I don't talk.  Yeah.  Imagine you sit down on the couch at home to relax and you just start talking about the  news and making jokes about people and fucking.  Oh, God.  That would be exhausting.  You're right. 
[01:31:30]  Why?  Why waste one of these amazing one liners on a few people?  Exactly.  When I could save it for the tens of thousands that listen to us.  Oh, Bob Saget is on Fox News.  And it says true colors.  I guess he's going to talk about how his true colors are really that he's a dirty guy.  You sure?  And not the clean image that he portrayed in Full House.  Gary, hold on a minute, all right?  We're going to get that number from you.  Yeah.  Let me talk about little tweaks.  All right.  Thank you.  Because we.  Oh, it's Bob Saget next.  After the commercial. 
[01:32:00]  Oh.  They do that dramatic walking onto the set.  We're going to have to listen.  They go to commercials.  To see if they mention the fact that, hey, you know what?  He's not as clean cut as.  It's about time he tells the world this.  Uh-huh.  Because we've known for many years.  Oh, have we ever?  But we kept his secret.  We did.  The only thing you can't do with him, I've learned over the years, is make fun of those Olsen twins.  He knows.  Try it today.  They're very powerful, those Olsen twins. 
[01:32:30]  Try it today.  And what's the other Olsen?  The one that ain't a twin.  Jimmy?  Jimmy Olsen.  Jimmy Olsen.  Cub reporter.  Photographer.  Cubby boy.  What, uh, what's that other Olsen?  Elizabeth?  Elizabeth.  What's some of the other Olsons we got?  Elizabeth Olsen.  What's she doing?  Mrs. Olsen with the coffee.  She's a big actress right now.  No, she's not.  What is she in?  Is she reasonable?  Is she in Godzilla?  I believe she, uh.  Is that the one that, uh.  Yeah, she's in Godzilla.  Roland was pitching? 
[01:33:00]  Captain America.  Roland's pitching her?  Captain America.  Yeah.  What has she been in that we know of?  That's her.  Or is she a midget like their, their sisters?  Fucking midget.  Little alien midget.  No, she's more like, uh.  What's she going out with?  Normal size.  Who's that guy?  Oh, I don't know if they're dating.  Well, he's holding her pretty tight.  He sure is.  I would.  And he's got a little penis action happening in the front of his trousers.  How so?  Why'd you notice?  That's where you, you gotta, you gotta take a look. 
[01:33:30]  I was just looking at her.  You just gotta take a look.  Um.  What movies was she in that we know of?  Um.  Not the ones that are coming out.  Well, I mean, the new Captain America is out.  Yeah, but that, that's, that's a movie no one's really checking out yet.  It's the biggest movie in the country.  Oh, stop it.  Who's playing Captain America?  They say about every movie.  The same guy is.  Yeah.  Frozen.  If I haven't seen the movie, it's not a big movie yet.  Right.  Um.  I'm still on Frozen.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Yeah, I don't know what you would know her from. 
[01:34:00]  But she's gonna be in the next Avengers movie.  And the next, and the Godzilla movie.  And she was just an old boy.  That movie didn't do very well.  Oh, man.  Was she the daughter?  I think so.  That old boy movie's sick.  The Jap one was better.  I liked that version.  You saw the American version?  No, I saw the Japanese version.  So why do you know it was better?  Because the American version, they have to fucking.  Oh, I know why.  They have to make it not as shocking and crazy that the guy was fucking his daughter.  I know why you didn't like it.  Why? 
[01:34:30]  Isn't Spike Lee involved in it?  Is he involved in it?  I think he's involved in it.  Then I don't.  Old boy didn't do well, huh?  No, it didn't.  He's the director.  I knew it.  Spike Lee directed that?  Directed old boy.  Spike Lee.  Goodbye.  He's a good director.  Goodbye.  He is.  Oh, I love that fucking floating in midair.  Yeah, I was about to say.  I like that as well.  Oh, that's so cool.  He doesn't.  He doesn't stop.  He's trying to get some, like, the Spielberg fucking push shot or the Hitchcock shot or  fucking the Scorsese fucking shot where you look at it and go, oh, that's that director. 
[01:35:00]  It's ham-handed.  You don't like Malcolm X?  It's a floating thing.  I don't like floating people.  I don't think that he did it for that reason.  Because he started doing that.  I think, I want to say in, uh, either She's Gotta Have It or Do the Right, or, uh, School  Days.  I mean, way back, like, when he was still, you know.  Jungle Fever, he does it.  Yeah, but I mean, he's been doing that, I think, his entire career, so I think it's just  the way he does walking.  That's stupid.  I don't like it.  Why not just walk? 
[01:35:30]  I don't know.  Just fucking have the people walking.  He puts them on a little platform and rolls them.  There's something weird about it, but I do like it.  I don't like it at all.  It's very distracting.  I think it symbolizes the way the world is going on around these characters.  I bet it's racism.  What?  I bet he's doing it as some form of showing people how racist white he is.  That's true.  White people float.  Yes.  Their white privilege makes them float.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:36:00]  coming in later but uh i tried to get him for something else he's no oh you have supported 
[01:36:30]  kiss and paul stanley forever even when we were giving him a good trashing and then in the end  they don't even know who you are friends and countrymen lend me a right ear see because he  doesn't have a right ear paul stanley should be doing something with jim norton period period  he's gonna be on ron at fez though right i get why he's doing that because you know that's a  great interviewer so i i certainly get that and he's doing out cue those are the two things he's  doing on the platform out cue oh that's a little um well it's totally fucking typical you may have 
[01:37:00]  a lot of gay fans i mean you know i think he does yeah i mean it's it's smart to promote there but  is he gay he might be doing something with larry flick and larry flick used to do  i think he's got a lot of yeah they probably know each other and it's a smart place  i don't think he's gay i don't know i mean there's been the rumors but who knows i bet he got a lot  of fucking pussy yeah he's married to a hot chick yeah except maybe piece of pussy 
[01:37:30]  that's great i was talking about this the second i fucking saw these drones uh the the things that  they could be used for and now they're saying that there was a terror plot that was thwarted yeah  where was that some guy wanted to fly a drone loaded with explosives into a school and a government  building and they uh arrested i don't know how much explosives you could get on there i mean  it would do some damage it would do some damage depending on what type of explosives but i think 
[01:38:00]  the the higher tech the explosive is whereas you need a little bit to make a big explosion right  it's harder to get unnoticed like you can make explosives but the damage that they'll do  isn't as isn't as good as as something that would put the feds onto you you know well that's you  know like a way you're gonna get a brick of c4 into this country to just put on a drone and fly it into 
[01:38:30]  a building they're gonna fuck up your drones yeah but i think this is gonna be your last summer of the  drone before some crazy laws are enacted they're using them for a lot of things there was one over  um i think i think a concert that was going on recently some guy posted a picture of a drone  flying over the crowd right and they were taking pictures a lot of um a lot of news stories like  uh accidents that happen and stuff uh people just launch these things and start taking pictures and  sell them to the media so i don't know if you're gonna be able to stop it they might regulate it 
[01:39:00]  you're gonna have to try to control it a little bit yeah how'd this guy get caught who tells people  they're doing something with a drone it's just you well he i think he had an fbi guy that um he was  confiding in to try to get the explosives that's where they usually get these guys it's it's not when  they try to do something it's when they try to get the fucking shit it's a lie what do you guys think  i can't tell you want my answer yeah we want your answer until you play c c i you're correct

[01:44:30]  and uh  now you got some employees  finally looking at the security footage  the next day  and they're kind of commenting on it  they're commenting on it  and uh  she's just losing her mind  can you hear it  oh yeah  and i just want to point out  there's a guy that keeps going to the counter  and i'm wondering if  he's just eating at mcdonald's  and trying to like  get napkins or something  should have gone on his knees  and just shoved his face  right in there  anywhere  right in her ass  no he doesn't do that  it would be funny though  but he can't be bothered by the fact 
[01:45:00]  this  this no  topless woman is  destroying the place  if you're hungry  would you walk up to look at her tits you think  i  i don't know you tell me who it is  or maybe it's a manager  i don't know who this guy is  but he comes up a couple times  and he's not phased by the whole thing  that's going  and where's the staff  uh  there's the two guys in the background  but they don't do anything  because the  the commentators say  oh that's  i forgot the name  because they didn't want to touch her  maybe  running away from titty woman  they're scared  yeah  let's play a little of this  it is very viral this thing

[01:49:00]  and very slowly hit a child  that was crossing the street  the kid was completely at fault  the guy does what he's supposed to do  gets out of the vehicle  to help the child  that he just hit with his car  and a group of black people  come over  and beat him into a coma  where he's got you know  brain damage  and he's on death's door  and it's just looked at like 
[01:49:30]  whatever  that's what they do  that's pretty much it  they're mulling hate charges  oh yeah sure they will  but even fox  they fucking  and as they're doing it  because they're so outraged  that what happened  they go into his truck  and steal his phone  and other stuff in the truck  and then take his wallet  out of his pocket  while they're stomping on his head  is there video of it?  no there's no video of it  but it's just fucking  but even fox that doesn't report that 
[01:50:00]  none of that  no no no  fox is just as bad with that shit  as every network  you can't report honestly about race  it's um  it's ridiculous  whatever  whatever  we're doomed as a nation  sorry  it's just the way it is  it's just the way it is  thank you  you can play a little Bruce Hornsby  some things have never changed  you can't go with the others  the way it is  wow  let's play that a little bit  it's nice  oh but don't you believe  I hate that fucking song  of course you do

[02:10:00]  it why not he didn't pull it so he just told so how are we gonna get this where is he he's he's in  the office if you want to what's he doing i asked him to pull it two hours ago oh no you asked him  to pull it yeah and he said he would or he said no way he said okay don't find your way dude not  doing that now that he's the star of the woo cronuts video he feels like he doesn't have to do  anything today he's trying to parlay that into a career right yeah the fuck there was an eric sign 
[02:10:30]  on wrestling last night so i'm sure that's giving him a big head it said eric comment or something  yeah which is which is technically an anthony sign anyway right yeah whatever are we going old  school we're going to start getting signs on uh wrestling shows and there was a we're going to  start assaulting the media again even though it's not an assault uh-huh we had raw in brooklyn  there was a stephanie mcmahon was walking out and there was a big sign behind her that just said  the todd show stinks i love it uh i think we fool around with some live tv again yeah we should 
[02:11:00]  i think it's time to start fooling around with some live to bring that back i think the hawk is the  guy to get it done we were the kings of that shit yeah everyone knows it too he is good right yeah  what do you say should we start fooling around with that again yes all right don't don't uh don't  touch anybody please no touching but touching just watch the hawk watch how the hawk gets it done  well he got it done for uh 10 out of the 11 seconds on video the last second is him with 
[02:11:30]  his tiny fist trying to figure out what to do next that fist move is classic that's on our facebook  page probably all right go there if you want to see uh woo cronuts we have that starring the hawk  that marion clip if you want yeah that's why i was just babbling i was just waiting for you guys to  find it this is how dumb people are on twitter by the way you do realize the guy had issues you act  like he's all there first of all stupid i know he has issues but i talk to him like he's a regular  person i i understand there's issues there but the self-centeredness is mind-bending and i can't 
[02:12:00]  take it no he's not he's not a blithering retarded person who doesn't know right from wrong you know  i think we should talk to dennis falcon about this issue because uh jesus please no no you sure  well uh marion police here's from the pre-show i want to talk to marion marion hey sam hi i want  to ask you something is this about the ultimate warrior yeah no no it's not ultimate warrior it's  about this uh get together next thursday together i can't go and i'm not i don't really you know i'm 
[02:12:30]  talking to you it's because diane called me up crying saying that wait was she crying about the  warrior no no you guys don't want her next thursday at caroline right now i can't go and i  quite frankly i think we'd rather have the warrior there but the thing is though why are you saying  you guys don't want me there oh my god yesterday we're getting oh my god this is we got where she

[02:15:00]  outright say oh we'll get you tickets you're like i don't know maybe maybe i can get some tickets  you you you you you you you're a grub a grub and then they asked you i wanted to go to the show  you're not going exactly oh my god and for all that i just said she goes no i wanted to go to the  show what how come you don't want me to be there because you're gonna interrupt everything because  your seat's good for three fans i don't want to show up in any way i don't want here's the list 
[02:15:30]  yeah i don't want bobo there what i don't want lady die there i don't want marion there  how does he got it how did he get a ticket i'm being he told me he told me he has a ticket  bobo does not have a ticket nobody has no one has a ticket yet those guys have got to stay out  they can join us afterwards i think we're going to try to write with something else going party but  i could join you afterwards oh thank the lord thank jesus christ on the cross for that one 
[02:16:00]  i want fans there that rarely get the opportunity to hang out and fans that aren't going to interrupt  and talk over us like this exactly this is what we're going to be so you guys 20 years  who's that who's talking you're not going i'm sorry no persona non grata  so marion you're brought up to speed a little bit this lady dies  why why me though why  i need it if i wanted to go 
[02:16:30]  i feel i think that you were probably categorized under the column of people who have a tendency to  interrupt and maybe aren't uh aren't aren't the quickest on picking up the vibe of the room you  know what i mean i am a lot of fun to be around i was just thinking that i'm not a drunk and i don't  and i don't embarrass myself okay i go out and i have a little bit of fun and you know something  if i if i can get there i would go anyway i don't know maybe maybe people are offended about that n-word 
[02:17:00]  thing when you said it on the video i don't know for sure i don't care what they're offended of but  let me tell you i say it like it is i tell it like it is right and i'm going to tell you something  i'm not that upset because i do have other things i have to take care of next thursday well of course  who cares with diana she's crying and crying and crying she would love to go we were part of the  show for 20 years back in the day before diana became a full-fledged alcoholic that was a lot of  fun before before that all right well let me now but now it gets out of hand right when she did the 
[02:17:30]  internship she had a good time even though i understand what happened what the crap listen to  this who gives a shit she made a mess of the bathroom and was banned from using the bathroom we  had to take her on walks you guys are trying to help like a dog i know you guys are trying to help  her no we're not trying to help her but i'm telling you woman in her 50s it ain't happening  okay it ain't are not happening not with that attitude let me but maybe this will clear things  up for you bobo called in uh after we talked to uh lady die marion you stay on the phone and this 
[02:18:00]  might clear up a couple things as to how the decision making how come patty gets to go over these  things she keeps her mouth shut yeah what she doesn't look the self-centered oh well that's a  good counterpoint that's a very good counterpoint not talk too much this is infuriating this is  infuriating why don't we hear when bobo called in yesterday we'll listen together marion and then  maybe it'll help bring us up to speak now what's wrong with bobo i can't hear go okay let's find out 
[02:18:30]  let's play track 17 hi who's this yeah this is the running circles don't we hi lady die  lady die yes shut up while we talk to bobo okay sure all right bobo bobo we got something called  the bobo rule for this unmasked is that it's the bobo we're naming it after you is that cool  it's like megan's law right something it's bobo's unconstitutional 
[02:19:00]  the bobo rule is simple we really appreciate you guys you don't care if she comes  stays with her toes are still tapping we support you know the support you guys have given us and  the great radio over the years is terrific but we just feel like this event is not for you  or lady die or marion is there anybody else in there oh come on come on i really want to get  to this is he crying bobo are you crying no but i really want to take it to this why did you tell 
[02:19:30]  lady die you already had a ticket yes why oh i didn't know what to do right why'd you lie how come  you don't want to oh my god you're a babbling idiot it's not about you that's true she behaved a very  important you'd never behave at anything i think you've never behaved at anything you'd be good 
[02:20:00]  right die wait wait hold on hold on a second uh jimmy said i never behaved at anything no anthony  jimmy said that after all these years you don't know the voices holy fuck see marion my only problem  you're still there right yeah i am my only problem with that clip is that since you're on the list of  people not invited to the unmasked event why me it makes it sound like opie is describing you  as well as a babbling idiot i'm not a babbling idiot why because i talk right and i like to have fun 
[02:20:30]  uh-huh and the idiot thing too i always events that me and diane went to in the past right we had  a good time we talked to people now i wasn't at some of these events were you a babbling idiot at  the events i'm a babbling idiot but i do talk a lot right but what am i going to do stand there and  people want to come and talk to me right during a show i don't get loaded i don't get drunk i don't  make a fool out of myself shut up no i've never seen you make a fool out of yourself but i'm going to 
[02:21:00]  tell you i wish i can go but i can't go but on the other hand i love the fact that she's she can't  even go when she's arguing and she's arguing why she should be able to even though she's not yeah  unmasked uh a week from thursday there is a bobo list bobo lady die and marion are on that list they  will not be there but if you want to be there go to siriusxm.com slash unmasked right all right  by the way as far as not talking when i did the beacon with dice last year yeah i come off stage

[02:22:00]  it's that's great though they're all just self-centered battling about going to the unmasked  we're a big get yeah i like that uh we got danny trejo he's he's a bit early so why don't we get him  right in yeah that's pretty much yeah danny trejo is outside the studio and a little later today bob  saget i might have to go to the bathroom though really yeah i have to go to the bathroom i thought we  break before danny trejo word danny welcome to the show take a seat over there loving it nice

[02:25:00]  you did ten ten i did five the last time but total of ten yeah yeah wow that's some uh what what a  what a comeback though wow that is yeah yeah how did you survive in jail were you like was it  personality did you have to fight a lot or what kind of got you through it uh deciding every morning  you're gonna be a predator instead of praise wow huh whatever you gotta do well can i read  something from the huffington post your story's amazing are you gonna write a book they want me 
[02:25:30]  to oh my god you gotta smoking his first joint at the age of eight hurling at 12 and that's after  his first arrest at the age of 10 for assault and battery after grade school he was robbing liquor  stores with live grenades and become a hardcore gangbanger with shootouts from car to car in his hometown  out there in uh los angeles yeah you started early yeah well i had an uncle that was my mentor you  know i mean my uncle gilbert he was he was just awesome and he just gave me everything that i was 
[02:26:00]  going to need right to survive anywhere in the world right tough neighborhood obviously yeah  pretty tough and you rob people with grenades well no if you walk into a liquor store and you're holding a  a hand grenade and you pull the kid and say look give me some money they're gonna give you some  money they're gonna give the money i would gather that's uh that's a good ploy right there were they  live grenades or was it a bluff no library when i went to prison i buried a couple of machine guns a 
[02:26:30]  shotgun 38 and a grenade in my mom's backyard and then i remember her writing me in prison saying  we're gonna put a sprinkler system and i'm he said don't get near the backyard  so you did five years and uh the last time the last sale and loot of narcotics i sold a  federal agent four ounces of sugar whoops what year was that bunco sales 1965 65 yeah because 
[02:27:00]  they say uh you hit uh rock bottom in 68 yeah so you pretty much that was in solid air yeah you were in  solitary confinement yeah yeah we went to the hole me ray bacheco and henry kihala were involved in  the prison riot and wow he sent us to the hole how often did you fight in jail uh oh boxing every  month oh you're boxing yeah yeah you don't fight in prison everybody thinks you have these you don't  fight it's easier to get away with the stabbing and yeah fight i mean if i sock you you're gonna sock me 
[02:27:30]  back you know we're gonna grab we're gonna wrestle and we're both gonna get arrested if i sneak up  behind you and hit you in the back four times with a knife i can walk away you know while you're like  coughing and spitting and oh man so i'm so basically it's just easier to get away right with the  stabbing than it is a fight what would you use to stab somebody anything yeah well it is make  now they're making knives out of five plastic spoons they just melt them all together that would be 
[02:28:00]  pretty yeah pretty stout you if you do that sharpen it up wow and then 1968 you turned it around  obviously yes now how did you how did you get uh get yourself together and actually pull out of that  well me and ray bacheco and henry kihala went to the hole for inciting a riot cinco de mayo 1968 and uh  everybody thinks cinco de mayo means uh fifth of may but for a real mexican it means you better get bail 
[02:28:30]  money you know because we're gonna do something wrong so we were in prison and we you know we ray  socked this free guy that was playing baseball you know he came in from the outside team and ended up  sucking him and i ended up throwing a rock and the rock uh ended up hitting a lieutenant was gibbons and 
[02:29:00]  henry kihala ruptured the coach kicked him strong iron anyway we all went to the hole and basically  those are gas chamber offenses you know they'll give kidney for them you know anything you get a free  person and go to the gas chamber hit a guard you go to the guys so wow wow so uh  uh i made a deal with god i said if you let me die with dignity i know i couldn't get out of it  you know i mean so i just said because i remember seeing this movie i can't remember the name of it 
[02:29:30]  castle on the hudson or something where where uh the hero of the neighborhood goes to the electric  chair and and he ends up going like a little bitch you know screaming and crying and uh-huh  himself so oh shit i thought i was going to the gas chamber so i remember just asking god let me die  with some dignity and i will say your name every day i'm alive and i will do whatever i can for my  fellow man and that was my deal and i thought it was only going to be like four or five years 
[02:30:00]  and then i was thinking the gas chamber you know god said well screw you  so you're saying god every day you know i in the in the report lieutenant gibbons wrote one of the  three individuals through a rock well first year law student you know that's out you know he didn't  mention any names so uh-huh and then uh the free person that ray hit wouldn't come to court and then  the coach straw meyer was in europe or something i don't know but so dj reject so kind of lucked out 
[02:30:30]  yeah yeah by the grace of god you know i've been saying his name every day and doing whatever i can  for my fellow man and i gotta say that it's paid off because everything good that has happened to me  in my life since i've gotten out of prison has happened as a direct result of help with someone  else really i got into the movie business by helping someone else really yeah because i was going to ask  you about that you get out of prison now a lot of people when they get out of prison kind of go back  into the same world you know uh same habits yes same things how did you same friends how were you 
[02:31:00]  able to step away first of all it's like i started going to 12 step programs a and a and and it's  kind of like pulled me out of the environment of of of drug addiction and people that wanted to stay  clean i mean it's like if you're trying to stay clean and you're around people that are using you're  you're dead you're not gonna do it so so i was around nothing people that want to stay clean i was i was  uh going to meetings and uh it just kept i just kept staying out longer and longer and i just 
[02:31:30]  started working in drug abuse you're helping people and that you know when you go into a house  and you're gonna like pick somebody up for detox and you see the living conditions you see the kids  it's like i don't want to go back to that yeah yeah you know so it's a constant reminder so so it's like  like it was like like uh for the 17 years that i was out you know to 1985 i was just helping people 
[02:32:00]  and then i i was helping this one kid and at night i remember i was getting ready to watch johnny carson  because it was about 11 o'clock at night he came on at 11 30 and this kid calls me up and says hey  there's a lot of blow down here in my job 1985 he said can you come down and just hang out with me  yeah so i went down to hang out with him i thought he worked in a warehouse because it was in the  warehouse district of la so i thought we were going to sit in the parking lot smoke cigarettes drink 
[02:32:30]  coffee you know and then and then he was going to go back in at break and everybody's gonna think  we're gay you know two guys sitting out of the car yeah and uh and it wasn't it was the movie set of  a movie called runaway train with john voight and eric oh yeah i remember that one sure and i walked  onto it and this this guy is funny because this guy says hey do you want to be in this movie and i  says uh what do i got to do he says do you want to be an extra and i said extra what and he said can you 
[02:33:00]  act like a convict i think i got that down right i've been in every prison in the state of california  you know i'll give it a shot yeah took off my shirt and i have that big tattoo on my chest you  know this guy comes over and says hey you're danny trejo and i go yeah and he goes i saw you win the  lightweight and the welterweight title up in san quentin i go yeah you're eddie bunker i knew this guy oh  wow what are you doing he says danny i adapted the screenplay because he was a writer you know he used 
[02:33:30]  to write he got real famous in the joint writing ritz because ritz have to be grammatically correct and and  and and they have to be like you know according to law and he got famous doing that because he knew  how to do it and he could spell you know because if you have one word spelt wrong in a writ they can  kick it out right right right so um he says hey are you still boxing and i says i'm not trained you  know and he says we need somebody to train one of the actors how to box wow and i said what's it pay 
[02:34:00]  and he says 320 a day and i said how bad you want this guy beat up i wasn't making that a week  and he said no you got to be careful this actor's really high strung danny he might sock you  i said eddie for 320 dollars give him a stick  i started training eric roberts out of box no kidding movie runaway train  and andre kodzolowski the director saw me and i guess he did you know eric was a movie star 
[02:34:30]  yeah so he saw that eric would kind of do what i told him to do and and uh he came over and said  you be in movie you fight eric in movie russian right you fight eric in movie i'll never get you  and i go okay all right and then and then he kissed me like and he walked away you know  both cheeks and i told eddie look eddie i'm gonna train this kid for 320 but if i'm gonna be kissing 
[02:35:00]  that guy i want some more money no no he's european i don't give a shit i've never kissed a man in my  life and so you're like but me and andre just kept kissing and they're like cool i just went to russia  on for his 75th birthday you know wow he called me and his dime took me to rest so he's really good  friends man he's a brilliant brilliant director runaway train was one of the best movies that uh 
[02:35:30]  the who's the two brothers ever did man i can't remember i remember that movie yeah  wow that's uh and that's how it started because then it's amazing so you get in you get your foot  in the door there and then what other roles just i got tapped heart beat i got all that right  the first time i'd ever been on a movie set and and uh i didn't even know what it was i didn't even  know i had a trailer i dressed in my car for two days  i remember my first i was my kid was about four years old and i used to go to craft services and 
[02:36:00]  make these big sandwiches and take them out the car and stash them and then as a single parent i'd take  them you know what do we got daddy i have all this candy and uh and uh this one girl caught me  making these sandwiches she's daddy you know you have a meal penalty and i says oh no no this isn't  all mine i'm gonna make some for the crew you know i thought i thought she was busting me for eating too  much right right i said no no no we didn't feed you within six hours so you have a meal penalty she's 
[02:36:30]  who's that for us i was mainly for my kid here so she gave me a case of coke and we just  you know so it was whatever happened to your friends the guys who went to the  he's still clean these were he's not the guys from the in jail that would oh no the riding guys  oh yeah the two guys he just passed away passed away a few years ago and uh you know he was what  god 80 he's about 80 and passed away and the guys you you were rioting with is that who they were  they were the guys they're all dead they are dead yeah you know ray butchard henry yeah they're gone 
[02:37:00]  and you you probably killed in a robbery really he was committing it or he was robbed no he was  committing it yeah and you think you know obviously if you stayed in that life you probably would have  been in the same boat right yeah oh yeah she is buried well the parole board when the parole board  let me out they said danny bring us back a life sentence don't you know don't even don't  don't fuck around anymore right with this petty bullshit wow we just want to tuck you away and  leave you there you ever go back into that world at all just oh yeah no no i go back all the time 
[02:37:30]  i talk and no i meant did you ever you you stayed completely oh yeah no i've been completely clean  yeah yeah there's no way there's no way to stay out of jail using drugs there's no way right  especially if you've touched it before uh-huh wow you gotta write the book danny that's an amazing  story it's an amazing and you're open about it a lot of people maybe would you know kind of  downplay it or not give the details well a lot of people are are are uh 
[02:38:00]  you know if you played with it you don't want to talk about it but if you owned it then it's like  it's there right i mean and it's like you know it's like people i've i know a guy that's got a  got a tattoo of of uh the gun tower in san quentin right here right neck and i said oh you've been in  acquitted no okay okay why don't you do that wow you know like you know so you want to identify  with that you know now when did you when did you get the tat uh on your chest that was 1965. 65

[02:39:00]  make machines they make their homes but in the 60s they used to have the needles and thread and tap tap  down wow that's yeah it was old school pretty painful no shit that's why anytime i walk into a uh  a tattoo parlor everybody knows right oh my god please it's kind of like it's famous you know you're  an old buick you know it's uh yeah it's made the rounds in movies too and that's for sure  the first five years of my career i was basically inmate number one you know i mean i never even had a 
[02:39:30]  name you know it was i thought i thought i was doing great you know yeah i kept movie after movie  as inmate number one badass number one yeah right right and uh and then i remember the first time i  was going to be interviewed this little girl fresh out of college was just so worried about being  stereotyped and she said daddy aren't you afraid of being stereotyped and i said that's what and she 
[02:40:00]  she's well you're always playing the mean chicano dude with tattoos i said i am the me  somebody got it right you know and he's so funny he's like in in badass you know badass yeah yeah  danny glover is like i'm i'm this this badass vietnam vet man what a blessing to be able to  play one of them guys it's like what an honor you know i mean so yeah yeah yeah that's the uh the 
[02:40:30]  movie obviously uh badass too when's that coming out that's on blu-ray now right oh it's in blu-ray  on blu-ray yeah yeah what was the first what was the first movie you did that it had was more than  just being the uh the inmate number one what it was uh let's check this out it was a movie called  death wish four with charles bronson i got to play with charlie and i met him and we became buddies  it's like you know he likes my style i loved you know he's my hero forever but i get to like like  like even talks like you grab him and go hey don't i know you you know and we talked he ends up 
[02:41:00]  blowing us up with a wine bottle oh man i got to talk to charles bronson paul kersey were you obviously  one of the bad guys that he had to uh yeah do away with oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and he's so considered  because he's supposed to throw water in my face right and so so we're sitting up like this right and  i'm just sitting like this and then he goes hey hold it hold it wait because they just said rolling  holy says uh come here and uh get the ice out of this uh out of this glass and so because there was 
[02:41:30]  ice in the glass right i didn't i didn't even know and so i'm wondering what the hell's going on so he  made him take the ice out it wouldn't hit you in the face yeah oh you know so you wouldn't you know  the ice yeah and i thought wow i would have taken the ice from charles bronson you're kidding yeah  so but but he was considerate to not wanting to throw the ice in my face you know so right so  then he's so sharp he says okay danny look look uh what we'll do is uh write that count to three one 
[02:42:00]  two three and then i'll throw the ice okay so you know and uh so he's like okay ready okay ready one  two two and whoa like because it's a surprise everybody thought great acting that was really  surprising yeah yeah wow that's pretty cool but he was also smart enough to take the ice out that  wasn't being considered because you did five years in prison that was really considerate i didn't even 
[02:42:30]  i didn't even think about it yeah yeah but that was just really and he was that kind of guy yeah  he's just a sweetheart you you you've always been uh like oh that guy from the movie when  when did it change where people started knowing your name because there's so many character actors  that you look at that's true i've seen that guy i know that guy that guy i've been that it's so  funny it was for a long time yeah oh god man cornejo from venice is a friend of mine uh uh ricky

[02:43:30]  it's fine i hate it no i don't and i gotta sit there there's a flight so so this is uh uh uh no  no it's okay well here will you sign me yeah i signed one verse who else was in the article i'm  gonna guess jt walsh was here oh yes yes he's a guy he always knew his face yes always knows and uh  uh uh jt i loved it yeah there's a whole bunch of a whole bunch i don't remember when did you start  being known as danny trejo god man what movie was it like tarantino throwing a movie in blood 
[02:44:00]  out that i did all right and it was uh-huh it really became really really popular cult movie  you know and uh taylor hackford's amazing director and yeah and he did it and i loved it because it  wasn't it was about three different chicano kids that grew up the same but ended up different in other  words you know uh i think another actor did one at the same time but it was basically you're here  they're all bad and we're all killers you know and so this one in in taylor's he did he was a one was 
[02:44:30]  a cop one was a artist and one was the leader was blanco one of the guys his name is that the movie  i'm thinking of where he had a blonde hair no that was a uh miklo miklo was one of the guys and it was  uh a movie called bloody and blood out and uh and uh the gang was la onda which was you know referred  to right and who's the guy that's in all of those movies he's a short uh latin guy he was uh y'all uh  he was in uh colors too he played like the oh no no he passed away i know you're talking about that 
[02:45:00]  was one of dennis hopper's friends oh god hey home yeah yeah yeah his shirt buttoned up top the top  button yeah he was good god what was his name there was no two one two one yeah it was not a  gang movie that he wasn't in from like 1950 to 1998. yeah google that in fact dennis me and dennis  talked about him when he was doing colors dennis is a good friend of mine and uh in fact i was  dennis's sponsor but oh wow yeah but when he got clean and and uh we talked about it and that's who 
[02:45:30]  we picked was him oh wow his name is great died in a car crash oh shit wow oh trying to find his name  yeah yeah wow what a freaking career holy what do the movies get wrong about like when we talk about  a guy who's a tough guy or or prison what did movies typically get wrong well well you know movies have  got to be fun okay first of all they got to be so it's like in prison i think i was in prison 
[02:46:00]  i think maybe i saw two fights two actual boxing matches you have all the time but yeah yeah but  fights i don't care i don't care who you are you know you would rather stab me than fight me uh-huh  because you're gonna get caught in a fight right and i'm gonna hit you your eyes gonna be black  if i'm dead and your eyes black you're going to the gas tank uh-huh you understand if somebody  gets stabbed and i got a i i got a drop of blood on me i'm it's mine you understand so so it's so 
[02:46:30]  much easier to get away with a killing than it is a fight jesus i mean that's i would assume also  in movies it's all very exciting uh in in prison uh scenes and whatnot but it's probably very mundane  on a day-to-day basis well you prison you have to create your own excitement whether it's in your  own head or right whatever you know but do you play chess uh yeah i know how to play chess but i 
[02:47:00]  wasn't like a real chess player a lot of those guys get really good because they got time yeah  play chess all the way around the world did you ever run into any of the wardens or any of those  guys that yeah actually i did after you were famous i mean i ran into uh god captain rogers  once up in lake elsinore and he was there with his family i'd been out and i was clean and i  left the otea i'd been out about five years and he was on one side of the aisle i was on the other  side i remember going captain rogers and he looked at me like oh and but he was you know he was he 
[02:47:30]  wasn't afraid he was just right family was shocked he was tough man he would not know why did you know  him though what was what was the story with captain rogers he's the one who sent us to the hole when  we had that riot oh wow he's saying quite captain yeah yeah he was a captain solid and now you're  famous and and you run into him well you know i run into something they go god trail man says we  knew you had something we don't know right that's cool i was a leader i was kind of yeah i was kind of 
[02:48:00]  a i guess somewhat of a leader in prison yeah but you you gotta you know you just gotta it's weird  it's like you know prison basically is a cesspool of society that's what we're and so you know what  do you want to do you want to be on the top of a cesspool or the bottom yeah child molesters really  can we always hear how rapists and child molesters get have problems in jail but i don't i don't hear  about them getting it off enough they really do have a hard time in jail they they pc up they get 
[02:48:30]  protective customers oh they don't yeah otherwise they just get killed because you'd like some of  that prison justice on some people well you know it's it's uh you got kids you know you you got  kids man and your kids so they have they have a big big stigma right yeah i'd do well in jail if  they were going to fight me and i just said i'll report this immediately  would not be frowned on it oh boy yeah i don't think that would don't worry i'll protect you  yeah he's putting his hand on my right shoulder and immediately i'm sinking and accepting the 
[02:49:00]  protection we got uh that's gonna cost you yeah the fuel was that a protection uh protection  angle yeah so we got a huge fan online they want him bad jason and bayside  you don't have to put him on but just put him close to your ears would work i guess jason what do you  got i just want to say mr trail my favorite scene is with you in heat and robert de niro oh he yeah  into my eye on that last scene where he uh gives you the mercy shot yeah uh that's you you really are 
[02:49:30]  a good actor and uh thank you that's all i have to say thank you thank you oh that's uh god working  with him he's the king everyone has um yeah everybody has such a you had such like memorable  scenes and lines i i i one of my favorite is uh dust till dawn of course with welcome to the titty  twister this bar is for bikers and tuckers only i've heard that every club every home 
[02:50:00]  deep boy that was like um stuff that was like cluny's first real real movie man we just kind of  nice yeah jokester forever man don't don't even try to out joke cluny okay yeah yeah and i'm a jokester  i can you know threaten or whatever he is the best yeah and uh and the nicest guy in the world yeah 
[02:50:30]  yeah yeah tarantino has been uh pretty good to you you know as well uh and rodriguez robert  was oh he's been awesome yeah yeah i've done 11 movies with robert 11 yeah we had him in just  recently fantastic we love talking yeah yeah i think robert rodriguez has done more for the  independent film community sure than anybody has in the last 50 years yeah you know he just he showed  my son gilbert who right now is actually co-producing and and oh i interviewed your son 
[02:51:00]  at comic-con we interviewed your son when we were doing uh something he was really nice  right that's what that name is for me yeah yeah okay and and they just did snapshot and they're  finishing it up and he had asked robert can i can i shadow you you know and sure so robert on machete  just took just taught him how to make a movie and literally he brought movie making out into the  general public uh-huh yeah and he's got the new rodriguez has that new uh what's the network 
[02:51:30]  what's yeah el ray yeah el ray are you part of that yeah yeah you're part of el robert i better be  my dog right there and he's a he he's got the new from dust to dawn yeah i will be on next season  and uh and uh yeah so right now we're doing that right now i'm doing uh uh saint george with uh  george lopez on fx and that's what's that about that's a comedy oh god i love doing comedy with  i mean george lopez is one of the funniest guys in the world yeah and he's actually from my 
[02:52:00]  neighborhood he's actually from san fernando right there and uh i'm from bucoima which is right down  the street you know but was he a fighter too or did he just joke his way out of problems no i think i  think he was more of a joker you know i think but we knew about each other for years you know what i  mean and uh uh i got all the respect in the world for him because he grew up in pretty you know pretty  that's not a that's not a uh a lightweight neighborhood and he uh through comedy he was  able to you know work his way out you know the actors must love working with you because you're 
[02:52:30]  one of those guys that has a more interesting story than they do like you know like actors we  always want to ask them questions like there's nothing you're going to ask an actor that's going  to be more interesting than boxing in san quentin almost getting the gas chamber it's so funny  because i like it when like actors start trying to impress me with yeah i grew up on the streets  and i go oh yeah okay well broadway two shows  it's okay i don't i don't care i mean it could be a tough life for all i know yeah 
[02:53:00]  have they tried to do that impress you yeah sometimes you know while they grew up okay  how many times you go to san quentin yeah exactly are there any other actors that have done time like  that there are i'm sure i'm trying to oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i know boxers  why did you come out but and uh why didn't you pursue fighting we well i i i came out of the  penitentiary in 1969 i i uh i tried to get a boxing license but i had uh too much violence and they 
[02:53:30]  wouldn't give me a license that's that's what boxing does yeah they put me they put me on probation for  two years so i fought club fights with a manager named howie steinler that i used to send me on  bucks just in the club kind of like uh smokers right you know and and uh made a little bit of  money but a lot of gambling in those places yeah yeah it made a little bit of money but but basically  there's in the 60s and the 70s it was kind of a really outlaw so you know you're fighting 
[02:54:00]  lightweight 137 pounds the guys are fighting 160 or something you know so wow so you had to be pretty  good and you did well i'm not sorry i i did real good until you start talking funny yeah yeah you  knew it was time to move on oh oh oh oh really you know so yeah find something else here yeah we had  joe frazier in yeah oh right yeah smoking joe god i loved him yeah he was he was a lot of fun yeah he  was kind of in and out like there was he was really it was fun to talk to him and then he just started 
[02:54:30]  kind of singing mustang sally whatever you want to do joe you're joe frazier if you want to sing  mustang sally we're gonna shut up i'll do backup all right but you see these guys that get fight for  a long time and they come out of it and they're all messed up it's always nice to see uh you know  and then there's guys that go through it all like bernard hopkins who's been fighting for all these  years that's it bernard is cool and you know what it's like he's right i gotta say it and i hate saying  it but one of the greatest fighters ever lived is uh is mayweather right now he's unbelievable 
[02:55:00]  yeah he's unbelievable and it's like i i watched him i watched him with the last uh uh canelo fight  and i was there with george lopez right at the fights and i was telling george uh what what uh um  uh god man mayweather was gonna do and he said how do you know i said i said he's telling you he knows  what canelo's gonna do before canelo's doing the difference between mayweather and any other 
[02:55:30]  fighter right now is that everybody is playing checkers and he's playing chess he's playing  chess is that you watch him he's two steps ahead of everybody i mean here's a guy that's been fighting  he's never been cut so it's like wait a minute never caught yeah did we know that wow and he's  he's he's just you know god just touched him and said okay you are gonna be one of the greatest all 
[02:56:00]  that other bullshit i'm the great all that shit all that bullshit but he is basically you watch him  you watch him fight and if you're a real fight fan you love watching him if if you like brawls you  because he's boring mm-hmm you understand what i'm saying yeah it's because it's like okay oh  oh right right and it's like you know if you're a real real fight fan he's he's he's wonderful but 
[02:56:30]  if you're not yeah yeah he's boring who's your uh top five boxers of all time we throw this around  uh uh you know what but then but the biggest problem with that is that first of all mayweather  is number one and of all time yeah yeah yeah you watch him you watch him and uh you put him here okay  now now that's just fighter now uh personality the guys i love uh roberto duran loved him right 
[02:57:00]  uh uh joe frazier unbelievable i just god i used to love smoking joe man and uh uh uh  bernard bernard hopkins i love him he's gonna be 50 right yeah yeah he's gonna fight crazy  motherfucker bernard i love you he's gonna keep it up for the old guys he's gonna fight at 50 yeah yeah  i don't hear muhammad ali on that last day well uh muhammad ali to me was was the absolute 
[02:57:30]  best uh mental fighter you know mental fighter he would get into your head and that's the way he'd  beat you but as far as like like smoking joe not you know bones smoking joe was a fighter right and  and i think i think joe  when joe beat him they were still friends you know they they were still friends and a lot of people  disagree but then after that in order to beat joe muhammad ali had to make him mad and so he started 
[02:58:00]  talking really bad about it he started saying stuff about joe that me and you couldn't say yeah yeah  yeah oh you understand we get sued so now all of a sudden joe is furious and he's angry and once you  get angry took him out of his game you're fighting two people right fighting yourself and you're  fighting your opponent so muhammad ali was the best uh psychological fighter ever and what about tyson 
[02:58:30]  to finish this up mike tyson's he was great he's become a friend of ours he comes on a lot  tyson was absolutely mike tyson could still be fighting if he didn't get involved with don king  yeah that's him right now he could still be fighting king i don't know that i don't but i just know  from what i heard from the people around boxing what what mike was doing with don right i mean so  until he says no we weren't doing that then you know all i know is that mike tyson could still be 
[02:59:00]  fighting he wrote a book you know the tyson's book is amazing it's one of the best uh autobiographies  i've ever read in my life and you didn't realize that he was deep into the cocaine during his oh yeah  his whole career well when he was with cuss he was he was doing pretty good yeah yeah and then and  then uh uh uh i think i think he mentions that cuss tiamato told him never get involved with don king  i'm not sure i think so yes do you know and not that don king's a bad guy don king just looks out 
[02:59:30]  for don king like he's supposed to he's a bad guy he's a bad guy but he's a lot of fun to be  around we've had him on a couple times he's the most charismatic guy you let it's like you know this  guy has been horrendous to the greatest fighters of all time and he's basically a shitty human being  and he comes in and you want to just hug him and hand him some cash right it's amazing he has that  ability he really does uh anthony's brother wants in badly uh brother joe on the line we got danny uh  uh trejo in studio what's up joe joe hey what's going on guys i'm a huge fan huge fan of your work 
[03:00:00]  always have been i um in fact i just wanted to say that you're one of the guys that uh as you know  early in your career as a character actor um i would see you on screen and that you know  uh recognize you immediately but i actually know your name now that's a huge thing for you know  for an actor especially someone who's done as many roles as you have um i i just have a question about 
[03:00:30]  a movie called badass that you did yeah um i just saw that i just saw that on netflix and um i i know  it was based on the incident that uh that happened in uh in la it was the um guy on a bus yeah uh you  know took on a tough a tough guy and i got kind of popular doing that how much more of that movie  was actually based in fact because i never read anything about it i never actually uh  it got into like one of you one of your best buds from you know from the army being being killed well 
[03:01:00]  i think i think it i think it basically took the idea and that's after that after that craig moss  brilliant director and great writer he uh he uh and my buddy he um i think he he took the liberties  of making that a movie otherwise it would have just been a you know that was a guy kicking some  guy's ass on the bus yeah it was entertaining though i loved it and now we got badass too on blu-ray  oh yeah there you go see available now badass too yes yeah nice way to get that plug in 
[03:01:30]  bad asses and you'll be a daddy glover and you'll also be in the new muppets movie oh man it's all right  yeah yeah he's great he's great it's weird seeing you singing and dancing with ray liota oh my god  hilarious your ability is amazing man yeah really is thank you thank you awesome i'm a huge huge fan  and you sound like uh if anthony would anthony probably agree you sound like uh a guy we used  to call tio mondo out in uh out in southern california oh god um yeah yeah hey george lopez i play tio

[03:22:30]  two weeks ago no it was it was eight weeks ago and she was alive when i buried her  what did she die of we don't know she watched full house and she went to arrest she had cancer  she ended up with pancreatic cancer oh wow that's that's a fast one they're all bad but that's a  brutal it is it's like the israel of the body the whole thing just goes how old was she wow 
[03:23:00]  we don't know no she was 89 still hurts though it does it doesn't matter how old the person is if  they're if you love them and i didn't even know she said to me one day you didn't even know you  love me this much did you and i said i said who told you i was in a moment of vulnerability  i shouldn't have said that how uh how long did you guys know because like you said that's a really  fast movie it was fast it was less than four months or something yeah she would you got to get a  colonoscopy and she didn't want them and i was trying to give them to her all the time oh i'd 
[03:23:30]  come after her with a rolling pin gloves because i wanted to use a rolling pin she used to make uh  holly with yeah holla bread and holla bread roll that dough wow but she uh didn't want to get it  checked and then it just then she had one in there so they didn't even do surgery on her why is that  such an evil one they can't cure that for the most part no it's weird it's one of those filters they  say they can take out the gallbladder you can do anything with it right come butterfly it you 
[03:24:00]  can saute it it's nice they're frying it's tasty you basically don't need a gallbladder now that's  what they say my dad had his taken out i don't even know if anything changed in his life right  without the gallbladder yeah it's a tiny little thing it's like plankton or something from i heard  that i didn't hear it i'm gonna listen to the reply we got some gall what did i miss gall yeah it  was a call joke i said call are your parents alive uh oh yeah well not one my mom my dad though uh 
[03:24:30]  back in what 94 something like that yeah but at least he got to see anthony become famous at a radio  star no just missed by about four months okay wow he saw none of it that was a good one not even  eternity thinking i'm still a fucking tin knocker right what were you doing uh air conditioning and  heating installation you know just like making millions on the on the air so you have the same  exact career you had no filter good night yeah yeah that was it no filter nobody's nobody would  ever say that to you or why would you even put that in your brain yeah what are you gonna do what 
[03:25:00]  are you gonna do jimmy's parents are still going strong my parents are still alive and uh and pretty  healthy and married and disappointed each other yes they are are they disappointed with you  how could they not be i i would be proud of you or my son if you know if my daughter was a porn star  right yeah that's my my mother doesn't understand most of my tweets she's like why does jimmy always  talk about transmissions my father's like all right well we need to get you through the night  mother do they see it yeah they see you stuff oh yeah it's really they're oddly non-prudish you 
[03:25:30]  know how you look at your parents a certain way and you think i can't because they're you know they're gone  oh yeah when i looked and that hurts yeah yeah i try to avoid eye contact yeah but they uh no they  were surprisingly non-prudish uh like with my act and my twitter and this radio show they listen to  and none of it shocks them they never once like hey you shouldn't uh which is nice right so they  supported you through the whole comedy through the whole thing they've been lucky supportive yes  a lot of people don't get that are they in the arts so they did they know they just knew that i was on 
[03:26:00]  a bad road and the fact that i started cleaning up at a very young age they were just happy for me  they're just really nice people it's nice to have parents that are supportive yeah you made a good  point there a lot of parents aren't no because they want their kid to do a safe thing yeah how  about your parents uh my mom's still hanging there sort of was she is she supportive oh yeah she was  supportive she was crazy as all hell though right could i ever sell oh yeah my we got to mention really  fast because it's breaking everywhere there was a mass stabbing at a pittsburgh area high school 
[03:26:30]  we need some knife control 20 20 victims how do you stab 20 people that's an i don't know it's  like how is that possible online for something like west side story yeah  four students in critical condition 20 injured in pa school stabbing uh near pittsburgh i bet it's  one of those assholes from call of duty that just goes around knifing people and noise them man  so they brought in their own knives was it like knife day for the kids because maybe it was knife day 
[03:27:00]  right so they frown on that now it wasn't from the cafeteria no no the plastic ones this is not  good they still yeah that's gonna be an odd thing to do yeah couldn't get his hand on a gun i guess i  don't know and in similar news dirty daddy yes dirty daddy it's about time to tell the world that you're  a bit dirty you know people are still surprised fox and friends was shocked i heard that dope but it was  funny i was sitting next to matt lower yesterday and he's like and we were on a bus yeah oh wait a 
[03:27:30]  minute but i wait but you weren't because bob they actually shoot the today show on a bus now because  they want everybody to see it uh he uh every yeah he's got a brain so he's like you know it's amazing  that you've that you know it's not shocking you've always had a and he didn't go you're dirty i'm not  really that dirty right i mean you guys know really dirty people sure oh yeah you're a little  shocked i guess shocking i'm gonna say a bunch but i don't yeah go gynecological i've seen your  i've seen your stand up you just said you chased your mother with a rolling pin what are you talking 
[03:28:00]  about right but that colonoscopy i'm trying to do medical help on her right you're right yeah who  talked about their mother with a rolling pin i didn't got uh jim that is not about my mother  other than simply just put instead of a colonoscopy okay fair enough i didn't mean it's all medical  hell see that proves bob's point he gets dirty but not that he's misunderstood so denial acceptance  has nothing to do with this i just used to love going to see you and and the people that would walk  out not because you weren't funny i want to make that perfectly clear there were plenty of those 
[03:28:30]  right your parents walked out on my show but that's not our jimmy but they couldn't believe that  you were actually edgy and dirty in your standout yeah it's so strange and is that still happening  to this day not really kind of the veil's kind of off yeah the book's not completely shocking but  this is funny that they wanted the byline which is the chronicles of a family man turned filthy  comedian so it's kind of like okay it's kind of obvious didn't really need it but it kind of helps  because it's kind of funny to hear someone very officious on the news read that but yeah i was on 
[03:29:00]  bloomberg yesterday and he goes dirty daddy the chronicles of a family man turned filthy but you didn't  turn filthy you were always kind of well let's just call it edgy as a standout bluish yeah and  bluish and then you got the whole uh family thing because they have to brand you with something right  otherwise yeah that came after yeah i'm really proud of the thing it's very hard jim you've done this  right written the books how many books have you written get them got it by who got to get a book 
[03:29:30]  written yourself it's hard as hell yeah i um i did too and none of the uh the editors didn't  fuck with any of it which i could which was nice right so i was happy with how they came out what  are their titles happy endings and uh i hate your guts i want to do another one but i never did one  like this just totally autobiographical maybe you should yeah maybe i'm i think in a writing one  that's uh well like you know if i ever get off all the sex stuff i would love to emotionally vomit  all that stuff on paper oh yeah this is a combo plot that you're so good at so maybe that would be 
[03:30:00]  i would love it i mean it was what you do on here naturally yeah but there's a lot of stuff i've never  talked about on here but uh i don't name names but you would name names you know i would never i've  never in my even in my never outed people as far as hey this girl never i've never spoiled names i  won't do it like it's to me it's a dirty thing it's all about me that's smart i didn't do that i  didn't name my kids in here or uh or my ex-wife and uh there's some stuff there's like to set up to 
[03:30:30]  the aristocrats in here and how that came about which is a pretty foul story yes and uh i didn't i  named you know i'm a name dropper um you know like uh richard pryer ronnie dangerfield and that  kind of thing and people that mentored me but i don't uh name there's a chapter called relationships  i'd rather not talk about as my mom was dying uh she was i gave her the manuscript to read i wanted  her to read it and she starts reading it and then she's and with this pancreatic thing you got like 
[03:31:00]  weeks once you get diagnosed so she was on uh no food no water and no iv and she decided to do  this thing and i'm like she was really cool so she got her name was dolly we started calling her  dolly lama because she was so interesting and then i never had that much clarity so she read 111 pages  i'm going to read your book bobby and she starts reading it and then her eyes started to fail because  you know she was starting to just go and it's really weird that i give my mother my dying mother 
[03:31:30]  dirty daddy to read it's like before you die all right i'm going to read this you know 50 shades of  gray mama oh man and she's reading it and then i come in the next day so sweet she goes i could  only get to 112 and i said okay you don't have to read it and uh it was about to be the chapter  things i shouldn't have done and a lot of it was about i did like try to set my grandmother on fire  and you know bad bad right and uh is that a real story yeah because i never know when you're kidding 
[03:32:00]  with some of these things you actually try to set your growth i didn't really try to but kids just  do dumb shit so i took a band-aid box and i put like gasoline in it and i was up well i don't know  i wasn't i didn't have a gun that's a good thing that's a good thing yeah and then so i put my mother  was walking by and i lit it on fire and my grandmother i put it under the bed but she was  sleeping in it she was taking a nap so it started to smoke and it was getting the bottom of the box spring  started to turn like black from it and then my i blew it out real quick and my grandmother woke up 
[03:32:30]  that's it's fucked up i know fucking malcolm x had a better grandson  speaking of your mom this was a this was just pure luck i just opened up your book  she gave birth to twins two years before you were born yeah and they didn't make it no i never knew  this about you yeah it's uh have you ever told that story before no not until this book wow uh 
[03:33:00]  she had two full-term maybe i did somewhere but you know i don't think it didn't get out anywhere  she had two full-term uh babies seven and eight days old and the hospital had dysentery and i didn't  know what that was for years but that's you know diarrhea and you die yeah and uh seven other babies  died too and the hospital closed after that i wonder why so how far ahead of you were they how old  exactly two years older they were born by the same exact day as me two years before may 17th and  the boy was robert and the girl was faith did your did your mother always like like remember their 
[03:33:30]  birthdays and stuff i mean seven eight days that's they're actually kids their birthday was my birthday  so she they she didn't even she got over it they they buried them but then i was this amazing thing that  got born and you know i had you know i wasn't normal i had a vagina and a unicorn head but she i don't  know what that is but but then uh i was the baby and then my two older sisters one died of scleroderma 
[03:34:00]  and the other died of uh i always say in the book hold your laughs to the end of this chapter wow  and the other one was uh brain aneurysm so it was 34 and 47 they both died so my mother i was it  she was in a hospital we were in a uh beautiful hospital uh catholic christian hospital in uh  la and there's uh mary and jesus statue beautiful one and i was wheeling her by it in a wheelchair  and i said look mom they made a statue of us because you know she thought i was better than jesus she

[03:35:00]  you know i started asshole and then ended p-hole right i don't know that's how i that's how i work  yeah yeah a man yeah but um but then uh he died and then his brothers died all his childhood it was  weird a lot of fucked up shit so that's where my fucked up stuff comes with the shit what was the  first death you remember like the first uh really jarring one i guess it was my uncle manny i was like  six or something he had a double heart attack he was smoking tons of cigarettes his wife's in the

[03:44:00]  kids right not even not even as friends come on i haven't been with the guys in a while fair  question it's just us right yeah i'm asking jim i haven't seen jim in a while the guy wrote i want  you to jerk me off that's sorry i thought you were chick no but i think i told the story about awful  club soda kenny one time when i was opening for dice in the late 90s vegas was the family weekend  where the dice and kenny would bring their families so kenny said to me one time before the trip you 
[03:44:30]  would never hurt a child would you holy shit what do you think you were i literally almost that would  have changed i almost quit the tour i almost quit working one time wow that's maybe it's your look i  know you know how it was to not yell yes into a bullhorn no i'm not attracted to children i can't stand them  i'm sorry i asked you that that's a great question i'm gonna actually put that on my  sampler i'm gonna get put that in my car as an audio answers that any other way but exactly i think 
[03:45:00]  the tent in my pants is the engine you're looking for who told you is the other one so back to that  story right so uh all the kids that were on the show were very young then you know young young and uh  they were up in their school room or in the trailer and uh i was there with just the crew it was  mostly guys a couple of ladies but i had the rubber doll i'm in the bedroom i have to do it  did you know anthony the oh there's the morality play of the show the little speech the sizer music 
[03:45:30]  comes in you start talking and so there wasn't at that moment but that was the scene so i'm in her  room and i'm going honey you know i'm holding the doll i'm looking into a rubber doll's head  now i'm you know i was always a comedian since i was 17 so i said i can't do this can we just read  it do i have to do this or no we need it for blocking cameras need to see it and you see it  so i'm like talking to you know you can't do this you can't do that and then i just grabbed it you  know and i just threw it on the bed and i just started pretending you know that i was right so 
[03:46:00]  the crew's watching this and they're laughing their asses up but i did it kind of slow i didn't  do it you know i took my time i didn't want to do anything to offend anybody at first i was like  dancing with it and then i was like you know laying in the bed talking to it well foreplay sure yeah exactly  and then um and it was very lifelike wow what come on that's crazy you can cut this out right  so one of the moms is a punchline so one of the moms comes down and this is all true and she goes uh 
[03:46:30]  you got to stop us right now this is on the monitor so kids can see this in the classroom the kids are  watching and i'm literally just i'm just going you know like lenny and mice and men it's not a good  thing when i'm doing wow and she hits a good reference to it just gets worse i'm doing it  is something wrong with me and then and then she said the kids are watching this turn i said well  turn off the monitors i'm working right and that was my my excuse was that i'm working that i consider  that you're working instead of work and instead of stopping i did stop telling them to turn off the 
[03:47:00]  monitors what class what classrooms uh they would have the kids on a sitcom or oh they're getting uh  learning yeah i thought i was doing book learning i wasn't sure some weird close circuit thing with  public schools or something that would have been awesome right amazing some educational channel  bob is famous too man if you walk around bob saget oh yeah it is unbelievable how uh recognizable you  are to everybody and it's gotten more because i'm older and because it just happened and the show is  new audiences like a three-year-old 16 year old the entire family demo yeah so the dying grandmother 
[03:47:30]  will have different things that they know me from and then the father will say something like i  like your entourage yeah yeah that's what i'm saying don't fuck my daughters and and he says  guys have said that to me don't fuck my daughter and their daughters next to them jesus and they're  young and i'm like a dude because then i turned them oh wow i bet your father said that's you  he said it uh earlier in my life not later would not have worked does that a lot of tragedy 
[03:48:00]  i want to i want a real answer does that ever get bothersome i mean you can't you just can't walk  around i i've gotten kind of good at it yeah it was funny because stamos and it's cool 45 minutes  i'm in a program to not drop his name so it's been it's a long time for me not to mention him because  it is fun to be recognized obviously to a point it's nice and but it's not even people go they want  to be a celebrity or something that's just like stupid i mean what what do you want you want to be 
[03:48:30]  famous and rich which is what a lot of people want right instead of maybe be funny or be talented  or do something you don't need any talent now to be famous no you don't you just go on something  and give somebody a rose or kim kardashian yeah what does she i don't know what she does still  she got a porn tape she took ray j's is that ray j right she took a big penis right she earned  her fame it's almost like being in the thanksgiving day parade it's like a balloon coming down  me earning it but her in paris earned it but she's a uh she does uh i guess she's a fashion 
[03:49:00]  no she's not i don't know everyone else does that stuff for her i've known her since she's a kid  because i was at the uh oh really i hosted the uh winter olympics remember i tracy did it one time  do you remember this there were like different comedians that came in i hosted the first four  nights of the winter olympics right after 9 11 so it was like at the end salt lake so she was there  with her whole family she was a kid you know but i have the video what i did to her  because nobody cares my my jewish wiener didn't mean nothing they wouldn't even put that on the web 
[03:49:30]  they don't even care if they got a sex tape out of me my penis is already blurred yeah yeah just  naturally yeah you take it out it's like scrambled eggs flurry we had a uh somebody called earlier  with a uh a sighting all right yeah i wish that guy would call you with jfk uh and um yes in the  knoll yeah and he he came up to you and said did you ever think of fucking those olsen twins i don't 
[03:50:00]  like that one as a verb with them well yeah oh we warn people that's that's the one thing you can't  joke i get the bob about i know we it's because i actually know they're actually smart and yeah nice  so there's more to it and then he said you turned around and said everybody why don't you go  fuck your dog i did not that's what he said it's impossible yes yeah yeah he swears by it it's a lie  i would never say why don't you go fuck your dog he's a blind guy 
[03:50:30]  that's so funny well now i don't think i said that no i don't think i don't come back with that i  usually say something like especially in public i go i i can't i can't go there sorry yeah what  would you do right i don't even want to get caustic with people because then they get all creepy and  weird and upset i don't want that that's true live the dream that i'm just a nice person that's one of  the few things that's off limits with you right yeah some twins what else is on that short list well  i don't really like cruelty and stuff i don't like do racial stuff right it's funny don rickles is a 
[03:51:00]  friend of mine and his whole thing is like hey the chinese guy look at the chinese and you look at the  audience and there's no chinese guy there so you realize he's just spotting the person when i say  that i mean the actor spotting not right and he just picks on a guy and he goes oh my shirts will  be back and the guy's not there no chinese guy so fucking funny rickles is amazing he's so funny  did you see him when he was here i have not i've never seen rickles no he's coming back i think he 
[03:51:30]  wants to be obviously but i'll set you up with all that is he still doing that at least i can do  for not putting you in the book you might be in the book i'm not i don't remember i swear to god  the virus might be in there i don't oh i think i had it yeah the editor cosby jeff ross okay okay  please don't read the book i saw i did see rickles i love you guys dolly sagin makes the book that's my  mom though oh man you know what everybody that dies right here right here listen everyone that dies is in 
[03:52:00]  the book you guys have never died you've got every day we do hot milly aunt milly building's on fire  by the way yeah yeah the building's burning and we're talking about hot aunt milly but but he's uh  he's uh i'll uh you gotta see rickles if you can i saw him once where'd you see him in vegas we were  doing me and jim florentine working with dice there's three of us doing the stardust and we saw uh one  one time we were the late what's that you heard of the crap i used the crap stable yeah no we were doing 
[03:52:30]  the uh i'm just gonna ask that literally no we were doing the at one point it was corman harvey  corman and tim conway doing the earlier show we were doing the late show wow and then one time it  was rickles doing the earlier show so me and florentine went in and uh we watched some of the  show and it was so funny when the black guy who works i guess works for him came out or whatever  and he's just you probably the bags and it was just oh yeah fucking funny but he took a photo with us  backstage and he was really nice he's he's an unusual guy is he one of those guys that hasn't 
[03:53:00]  really has been working the same act for like 50 years yeah he adds to it he's got songs in it that  he does but he adds just tiny little changes and then he says stuff to the audience that no one else  can get away with it or i wouldn't want anybody else to he calls a guy for some reason he goes all right  shut up you fag werewolf and i'm like and i'm sitting with stammers we're like what what does  that mean and then we talked to him after and he's like yeah people are laughing at that they 
[03:53:30]  like that one fag werewolf what does it mean it means it's the guy gets like with with uh hair  like wolfman jack or something it's a werewolf but he's a homosexual right okay and that's the  only way to insult the world it makes sense i think i think that's what he said werewolves are  notoriously homophobic right you know you call a werewolf a jew it doesn't matter to them if you  call him a fag immediately are you saying there's no gay werewolves well you know kind of like akhmand  dinajan said about iran we know that they're existing but werewolves deny that right right 
[03:54:00]  no homosexuals and then there's uh but the book has the rodney stories in it you know all those  fucked up things he was good to you right yeah you're really good uh it was if you got too close  to them then it would get kind of weird because you because he would you know he smoked  a lot of dope and he was and he was a friend of mine and we would talk about real stuff if he  would if he felt insecure and stuff but then he would uh i don't know he wanted you to do well  but then he had you know he was competitive in some ways as much as he was also kind of like a 
[03:54:30]  godfather of taking care of young comics he really loved young comics wanted to help jim carrey he had  jim carrey open for him once and jim was just trying to experiment and not do his impressions not do  is all of his rubber body stuff and uh and he said he said you know i'm just going to try some  new stuff man and he and he he went up and just bombed before him and it was a big show somewhere  big and jim did like 20 minutes and just bombed and rodney was like that's okay man because rodney 
[03:55:00]  didn't really care he was happy when you bombed he slayed afterwards he just  destroyed he was like the funniest thing he would do in his set when rodney was having a good set which  was a lot because the jokes are so fast and he he would take a couple things about it he was  self-aware i got a lot of fucking jokes all right that was one and the other one he would go i'm  fucking funny all right and then he'd say that to the audience that people would just cheer yeah yeah  he just knew he was just knocking every ball out of the park dice said he got weird with him though 
[03:55:30]  because you know he helped andrew so much yeah he wanted him to to do something with him in the  arenas work together and rodney's like what do you think i need you to help me know and i said no  i want to just do it yeah that was that kind of thing but he was like he kind of got like well i  don't need you wow we did it we did a thing once and i i didn't have a gig or anything i was just  trying to get somewhere and it was me harry basil who did a lot of stuff and bob schimmel and um bobby 
[03:56:00]  wow yeah he was funny he was really funny so we're standing out and rodney had us play long beach  rodney hosted the show so it was kind of like a replication of his young comedian show  and there were four of us we're trying to think who the fourth was it was a funny person um might  have been slayton but i don't know but schimmel and i and rodney are talking rodney brought all  we want to do is bring a hot dog cart with the hot dogs with the skins and serve them to us before  the show so we had the prerequisite was you had to eat two hot dogs with chili he had the person that 
[03:56:30]  was his way of treating us they're gonna be good man they're gonna have you know chili and that was he's  excited and then and schimmel and i were talking and with rodney and and we were just talking about  going on rodney was like why am i fucking doing this i'm hosting the show and he's and these guys  think they have stars so he was kind of putting us down while we were eating hot dogs jesus and he  worked he did it like he was doing some live television shows in long beach for like a thousand  people and he was killing himself he was he was sweating out hot dogs he'd eat a couple hot dogs 
[03:57:00]  he got on stage he said oh this next guy's really great man and then schimmel goes up he goes what  the fuck did i do this for i feel sick funny guy very funny guy yeah we met him i mean they interviewed  him and i was rather new on his show yeah yeah i said nothing during the interview there's no time  i ever met him i wish i would have known him kennison i wish i would have known too i was i actually met sam  before uh anybody in la had i i met him in houston so i actually helped tee up his first uh spot at 
[03:57:30]  the comedy store i told him sat next to mitzi and said you gotta watch this guy he's really good i mean  he didn't need me to do that but uh but right he he got the spot though no it was it was he was so  fucking funny when i met him he had just been in the houston chronicle because he chained himself to  a telephone pole and a diaper and a crown of thorns and he was on the front of the entertainment section  that said he'd been persecuted like christ by the club owner it was the comedy works in houston 
[03:58:00]  and he was like he literally was he did the whole thing where his eyes were rolled back and he had  blood coming down his head from a comedy club but what did the county club do to him they wouldn't put  him on they got mad at him because that's it so it wasn't his material it was it was yeah that's why  he wouldn't put him on they were censoring his actual act they just felt like it was too edgy for the  he was saying it was so weird because when he started you know he was a you know the whole  story about him he was a you know did gospel tent things he had fake healings and shit you know 
[03:58:30]  he and his brother yeah is there any footage of that anywhere i don't think so i'd love to see that  yeah it would be vhs if i don't even know if it'd be vhs it'd probably be like what the  fuck would it be beta yeah is bill still around for real bill's around they're supposed to be doing a  movie about it right yeah who'd they get they got uh was it josh josh gad oh yeah he talked about  that yes that's what i heard yeah josh gad okay he was in here telling us yeah he's taking that  and i heard jay roach was directing and i think that's what i heard but i don't know oh he did 
[03:59:00]  the bar movies yeah i loved uh kinnison growing up man i hope they do a good job with that it was  unbelievable i was on that first young comedian special yeah and i i had like a 12 minute killer set  but sam had a a 15 minute killer set and it ended up being 12 minutes that ended up being three  minutes oh shit and so that was kind of interesting and i went right before him so that was kind of the  way the show it started to like escalate and then sam just took the show and in post i remember and  and in the room i'm not he just fucking slayed the whole room because you live in the desert that was 
[03:59:30]  that whole it was one of those things too the next day we all were just quoting kinnison's act from that  night he became an overnight since not just a star he was out of just huge no one had ever seen  that and it was like a prophet because he had taken all that ministry stuff and this was the resin  of it this was the shit that came out of all those years of having to go if you believe in the lord  and then he turned that into the hypocrisy of the whole thing the cameraman can give him a sandwich 
[04:00:00]  right you know all that shit go to where the food is right i'm sure anyone else have a better night  than him going from almost like nobody or whatever it's huge i had a fucking lit it up a big night  too a lot of guys probably freddie prince right right man dain cook kind of happened he worked  really hard for a long time but then it kind of happened fast but i mean one night where all  sudden everyone the next day is talking about you and uh you can't have that nowadays because it's all  on demand and this and that yeah we come from a time you all watch the same fucking show at the exact 
[04:00:30]  same time yeah you can't i mean uh kevin hart was like this long process to become i mean that guy  sells movie concerts he's great he really is one of the genuine articles that exist he well kevin i was  just thinking about him too he did the shack roast and that made him big like that helped him with he  had big black crowds and then he started crossing over with the films it was like a but it was a slower  bill like kevin wasn't one event and done you know he was just a bunch of accumulative yeah it's just  hard to do now there's too many channels and people are watching whenever they want it makes 
[04:01:00]  it harder and there's no sitcom person that comes out because nobody really gives a shit mark price  i hate sitcoms i can't i hate it skippy skippy yes i have his cell number in my phone and i  sometimes i just don't take things out of my iphone that i had on my mac plus  and it's just still cross pollinates from things my palm pilot old contact yeah please call me and  then i would write mark price skippy underneath it yeah under company right you gotta do it that way 
[04:01:30]  and something else oh yeah we saw rodney at the end of his life doing stand-up there was rumors his  wife was feeding him lines and stuff so really and he was still pulling it off yeah she was helping  him do stuff but i don't know why he was doing it he was still writing stuff too why wouldn't he  just retire people don't do that plus he didn't make it till his 50s in 59 he did caddyshack that's  what's kind of is that how old he was it's in the book i was like a poignant thing to me because i'm 
[04:02:00]  gonna be 58 he was 59 wow that's a long fucking career that's jack jack uh jacob cohen and then jack  roy and then rodney dangerfield wow he was three guys and he did aluminum siding yeah yeah yeah i didn't  mean to put that in the air conditioning that's the same well you're just fucking with metal did  you ever go to radio shack yeah uh no it was always granger had to go to granger and pick up some  shit get some copper tubing get some fucking tar and get up on the roof and fucking they're gonna 
[04:02:30]  leak under the unit and oh did you like doing it like i was a deli club you hated it you didn't even  pause hated it i always knew i had to do something else how long how old were you when you started  getting it was like a dad's business no i just needed a job you know i was in my 20s and uh my  brother was doing it so i no not yet not at that point so i just went in and you know started started  doing fucking air conditioning and then you just get stuck in there and you see the guys unloading 
[04:03:00]  the trucks and they're fucking in their 50s and you're just like oh god no and it's like no country  for old men right you're climbing in an air vent yeah and you can fall through the roof right yeah  yeah you're all you're in constant uh danger of of dying or getting a severe injury uh all the time  you're you're working with in essence or giant razor blades all day long and chemicals and shit yeah  chemicals and then and then because you're putting in the heating and air conditioning system there's 
[04:03:30]  no heat or air conditioning where you're working so it's just either fucking blazing hot or freezing  cold all the time so it's the holocaust it's terrible yes it was it was worse than the  holocaust i'm going on record as saying that did anybody ever accidentally turn it on while you were  in there uh no i don't think so i uh bob's hoping i've had people fall through the ceilings though  when you're up in the attic you got to stay on the beams yeah up there the joists and uh if you 
[04:04:00]  hit the sheetrock in the middle your foot just goes right through and so if a guy has girth to  him and yeah and some of these guys are big uh-huh they they're like they can just fucking fall through  the right through right through that's terrible terrible it was an awful job awful how long did  you do it oh god from my early 20s until my uh i guess mid 30s so a good i guess you know almost 15 years  that long yeah it was just i i went from one company to another company and then you'd go to 
[04:04:30]  the next company and you'd talk yourself up to make some more money make it sound like you know a  lot more than you do i did i did as little work as i needed to do is it all freon you just add freon  yes it needs a little freon and your compressor it's always a compressor yeah there's a compressor  problem it's your line set has a leak your your condensate pump your coil there's a copper  coil that goes out yes the coil is always the problem sounds like some gynecologist your coil's 
[04:05:00]  frozen it's frozen your your your your fan your squirrel cage isn't running in the attic  they do get up there they get in your systems of squirrels well they call a squirrel cage the fan  in the blower unit in the attic so it's like when that breaks the coil freezes up okay and you can  blow your compressor out because it overheats have squirrels i thought i had a squirrel  fucking with my thing and trying to eat through it yeah they're on the roof can they do that to 
[04:05:30]  the uh yeah they can they could ruin things i'm gonna ask you a lot of questions i had the same  thing but it wasn't a squirrel on my roof it was a gerbil through the toilet paper tube i was holding  can a gerbil get into it yeah because they can get in your asshole so they can definitely get  in a little bit what you do is you smear a little breeches on the inside of the tube of the  toilet paper and you're shoving your asshole and those rascals run right in the worst thing were  bees because you go up in the attic and they were just like there'd be a bees nest and it means they're 
[04:06:00]  getting older the the homeowner doesn't want to hear like there's bees up there i can't do this  you know they just want the job done so you just go in and get attacked by bees and you'd have to go up  with a can of raid and spray the bees and work in between them trying to sting you and in the the  reek of insecticide it was terrible where would you see the bees the most were they inside the attic  or outside yeah inside how would you know you'd get up there just start to hear yes and they fly 
[04:06:30]  around you hornets too yes and it's all sticky it's like a little stalactite of rock or something  right horrible yeah did you ever get stung yeah you did yeah it was awful i wouldn't have done it  i would have said i'm not working with bees yeah get rid of the bees oh i had i had a guy that skunk  removed that was his job at my house i smelled like dead skunks he goes up and he finds them he's a  tracker he knows where it is coyotes had ripped open two skunks in my house oh my god and this guy 
[04:07:00]  comes in with the hazmat bags and comes in and i said you're gonna go up there he says yeah it's  what i do bob and he goes up and he just takes the dead skunks and puts them in the thing and then  goes home i said how do you get rid of the smell this is really doesn't ever come out wow so that's  never that's a up guy you know who i'd love to interview the two coyotes that made that mistake  i have to sit down with them for a half hour right what happened i told him they don't look right he said 
[04:07:30]  they did i'll never eat that shit again right maybe they like it no they don't no no it's the  most abhorrent smell in nature it's a it teaches no animal fucks at the skunk twice oh that or a  porcupine yes you see him with the quills in their nose and they're trying to get him out there should  be a combo of those two animals you can't you can't feel bad fuck it or be around it i didn't mean  there's an animal you can fuck yeah yeah oh yes it's not an animal you can't you can hold that little  rascal sign quarters yeah it's rat fucking that's where the term yeah now uh what is it pigeonholing

[04:21:00]  though and yeah and so you go back every once while but every once while i check in but yeah  because after a while you're just like what i'm gonna make up a story why i didn't get a bike at 10  and right and why this is an issue now i had a fight with somebody yesterday right you really  run out of the things right the important things that you really do need to talk about and then  you just start like i don't even mean what i'm saying to you i just am filling up time yeah you're  following the script it's like an improv exercise but she was like you're ready i was able to flush  out a lot of stuff finally i leave early sometimes though if i go yeah my therapy is 45 minutes now and 
[04:21:30]  i'll sometimes i'll do 40 whether it's 45 sometimes i'll do 20 minutes the arm tire i'm gonna go  do a good 20. sometimes i'm so tired by that time it's like i'm exhausted i just want to get  the fuck out of like stand up you're doing a good 20 for her type 20 i'll type 20. finish it up nice  it is nice to close well when you're leaving if you leave and you're like have that look of  you're yeah just lost that's just sad we usually just make out you know that's that's cool yeah  we end our therapy by making it out you know so it's because i think so it's all foreplay all of it 
[04:22:00]  yeah i have a thing for older women so we try up a little bit on the couch and then we do  do you like older women i don't mind sure so it's any woman any age yes of any and jim you  like older women no you like them like over 60 70 no i like women i mean look there's women in the  30s i'm very attracted to there's women in the four but i like women in their mid-20s i don't want  them young like a child but i like them 25 28 maybe 30 i have a uh issue with that too i'm almost trying  to get into double digits now with women but it's it's i don't know they because i get it because 
[04:22:30]  i'm as old as i am right that they always know do you want to get married again and i'm just and i'm  like i'm just and it's in the book actually i'm just can we just finish our beet salads you know it's  like the first time i met them beat salad well that was the what would you have with them yeah i mean  that salad you put them in a smoothie oh well that's what i can't drink them yeah but that gives  me uh diarrhea sometimes if i have a smoothie with all the beets in it that's the best part of it oh 
[04:23:00]  dude the best part of a vegetable juice is stiff legging down your hallway because you're going to  shit down at both your thighs but explosive if you're in this building and you got it out in there  the whole place just smells like a fucking beauty of it clears you out the old uh the old woman the  old lady thing though when you're younger uh yeah i was into it to a point not crazy ages but  then you get older and then you start doing the math and you're like i can't have that fetish  anymore because now they're like they gotta be 60 or 70. what about like raquel welcher somebody 
[04:23:30]  had a crush on as a kid who's like 75 it's still hot yeah jane fond i'd fuck either one of them  sure she looks good though man for a woman that old i never liked her tits i mean i didn't even  like her in her barbarella days no i was never a fan of hers i was a fan of his include when she  was a hooker yes i like her in vietnam there's a time i needed big boobies yeah so raquel i needed  that raquel welch was my go-to uh the one million bc thing yeah i'm just glad i didn't hit it from my 
[04:24:00]  bed and then it was on the wall but that's another thing you wake up one day and you're like what are  you doing you don't need big boobies all the time that's true too you gotta have yeah i know ridiculous  i know but you wanted the what was in the magazines right right i smuggled playboys in my house when  i was a kid what girl would you say you've jerked off most to in your life like what celebrity or  whatever um was there a porn i think there's a couple in porn that i might be my on my all-time  great list it was like a long time ago like old school porn i am i can't i can't even remember 
[04:24:30]  which big big big tits though it's okay to say tits on the air yeah of course no  hold on let me hold on let me read the cover of your book dirty daddy the chronicles of a  family man turned filthy comedian yes you can say okay yeah there's a guy in the line kevin in houston  actually i i have to do this to you go ahead kevin we got bob sagin in studio for a few more minutes  hey hey bob how you doing i wanted to ask you if you knew about the phenomenon now with kids 
[04:25:00]  watching full house reruns i have two little girls nine and six yeah i keep you everyone in  their age group watches full house it's i mean it is the the show to watch now i know it's crazy  it's on two networks right now it's like and and as the kids are discovering at two three years old  i think it's because it's on videotape so it's brighter it's not uh you know the digital stuff and  it's also got a three-year-old gone on nuts you know it's like a characters that talk like they talk 
[04:25:30]  which is almost kid show stuff i mean it is kid show god it's nice though it's a it's a high  compliment i don't remember doing almost any of it you really don't well i do i mean you want to  block it out if you're dancing you know running around like a geek and stuff but i know that i had  a lot of fun i had a lot of fun with the day-to-day filming of that show yeah a little bit there's  a story in the book where i made uh dave and john do uh nitrous oxide off the whipped cream cans and  so we that was michelle didn't have any whipped cream on her birthday cake right for the prop 
[04:26:00]  thing really sweet fucked it up but it is it is a it is a wonderful show and on the flip side of that  it was a wonderful it's a wonderful show for kids to watch because it's you can let them watch that  you ever do the show high or anything like that no just that one that one incident no no no booze or  nothing and the truth of it is uh there were kids around so it's right as much as my couple stories  are sensationalized i was going nuts i was manic i was going through divorce and stuff and i was  kind of crazy but and i had a i would go to stand up at night and had a sister dying during it and all 
[04:26:30]  that kind of crazy stuff but i i i actually love doing it i'm close with everybody that was on it  so i think that's the other thing kids see that they see that we all like each other they can tell that  right they don't know about dramas of actors and what they act like but that's really nice sir to  tell me that oh you hung up oh what was that i i what was the years the show ran uh 87 to 94 i thought  it was earlier okay four i think yeah and then you had the video show as well yeah that started like 
[04:27:00]  a year later that was i was i was in buffalo just being a nobody on the radio and we we'd all get  together to watch that show it was a sunday night thing it was a sunday night thing it was uh it was  chris shire remember she was the morning girl and she would have us over almost regularly on sundays  and cook a huge meal because most of us were we're from out of town trying to make it a radio  and we'd always put that show on it we wanted we approached i mean it's a blooper show but we  approached it like we were doing some variety show and i was going this is the right you know why world 
[04:27:30]  of disney right hour that's when i grew up so at seven o'clock we were doing really expensive bits  that nobody would dare do how many people were watching this prime oh god i know that it was like  25 million yeah no one touches these numbers anymore it was number one it was uh 25 million  every sunday in the beginning it was gigantic yeah 25 million it was it was there wasn't that much  television there wasn't that much cable there was hbo and i was like you know in the mid 90s 
[04:28:00]  that was enough that that was just wasn't in 90s it was early 90s it was 87 oh you mean a year after  full house that started no a video show also started i think it was 87 wait which had the 25 million full  house or uh video show the video video show was number one for a while so that's you know it's  exciting but you know that that officially is your number one show you ever did as far as numbers but  not but in more people i mean full house is around the world a lot and then tom bergeron's had a big  success and he's leaving the video show now busy so we're going to dinner to talk about what it's like 
[04:28:30]  at night to try to not have people get hit the nuts in your mind guys get hit and i wanted to leave  the show and it was just old people falling on cement they made they made a reel of just old  people like falling head first on the cement and they would cut right when the impact happened and  they cut to someone in the audience with their head flying back laughing yeah that is because that's  what they would do they would not show the impact so you're therefore we're not watching faces of death  you know you gotta redo that show beheading videos oh no i don't think he wants to cut a piece of 
[04:29:00]  cheese those gutted seniors they never showed that they would never show the actual impact oh  my sometimes they did with a younger person you know but it's an old person you know you know a hip  got broken or something it's terrible did you see the video of the old lady that they're spinning  around uh-uh i get upset at stuff like that it's so funny i talk like this and i do the kind of stuff  i can't look at it i ask because it's one of those videos that you're supposed to be really upset by it 
[04:29:30]  but there's something how she's spinning around i guess you got to be twisting i don't know of her  coat they don't hurt her they don't hurt who does it to her some we don't know i i feel like they  know this lady and they're just messing with her knowing that she'll be oh so it was a hazing  i don't know though could you show that video it's gonna bother my did they swing her around yeah by  her clit so it just kept growing and growing you know basically every day it was a camel through her  every day there's a viral video but it all started on on the video show with you yeah it 
[04:30:00]  did but they didn't swing all the women around i i want your manian i want your honest opinion on  this this is all right there's not two girls in a cup right no no no that's that's you know you made  me watch that yeah yeah that was a nice morning of my life then you called joe francis in prison it  was a good time oh you were there for that i was there i almost feel like we should uh film him  watching this uh hold on just in case oh my grandmother really and i want to i want your  real reaction this is this is what happens right i don't know back old memories for me it was me 
[04:30:30]  and jiv ross sitting there i feel like you might laugh at this there's no but nobody shits in a cup  right uh no hold on all right hold on wait where am i okay hold on hold on all right these this is  one of the bad cat guys yes it's a bad person i would say so yeah check this out  right oh my oh it's felt cooked 
[04:31:00]  she's just a crazy old lady running away wasn't she on benny hill  oh christ  they told they they chase her down  not good like a lord of the rings creature  what do you think bob well i don't think it should be done to people  i don't think people should do that of course what i'm impressed by to be honest with you  is her coat her orange coat is tufted and it seems she's like the mission she's uh she's 
[04:31:30]  she apparently she's ready to go i mean she like it's like a video game i look like the old zelda or  something you just swing around for a little bit you set her down you go get her again  you better you swing around a little and she runs for a while and then you pick her up it looked  like it wasn't even real no i i'm not saying it's funny they didn't hurt her they didn't  her she doesn't look hurt no and the screaming's lovely do you like the soothing voice i really i

[04:48:00]  look i have four minutes on this post show today i don't have time to wait around for alex let's  play line of the day here comes the line of the day line of the day  i remember i was getting ready to watch johnny carson this is about 11 o'clock at night he came 
[04:48:30]  on at 11 30 and this kid calls me up and says hey there's a lot of blow down here in my job 1985  he's can you come down and just hang out with me yeah so i went down to hang out with him i thought  he worked in a warehouse because it was in the warehouse district of la so i thought we were  going to sit in the parking lot smoke cigarettes drink coffee you know and then and then he was  going to go back in at break and everybody's going to think we're gay you know 
[04:49:00]  danny trejo was a great guest today which is funny because they started and this happens every time  and and roland doesn't even realize it now because roland gets stressed out by the whole thing but  every time they start the show talking about not wanting guests they have a great time with the  guests they don't want any guests until they actually have them in studio they very rarely opie and  anthony have bad have bad experiences with guests but they never remember that they had good experience 
[04:49:30]  with guests no of course not uh let's go to kevin in toronto kevin welcome to the post show  kevin hello kevin hello yeah what oh i'm sorry uh my name's cameron well look cameron we don't have  time to play the name game okay i just wanted to say i don't want lady die or bobo to be on the after  the show today it's a listener request listener requests coming in listener requests coming in the  first listener request is no bobo or lady die so if i get a call from them that's no go yeah tell

[04:50:30]  wrestling from the dwe for like 15 years i think it was 10 years yep i think you're right it was 10 plus  years correct and he comes back finally he does one weekend he does the hall of fame he does wrestlemania  not to wrestle just to stand up on stage and then he does raw not to wrestle just to do an interview  in the ring and the next day he's he croaks it's it's um you know he he looked he didn't look i 
[04:51:00]  remember the interview you did with him on youtube yeah uh right before the video game i remember what  what time was that you remember like what when was that what month year uh that was i mean it was just  last year last year he looked he looked great in that interview but then when he gave his speech i  could tell you know when he gave his hall of fame speech um i could tell he just didn't look good and  when he was on raw he really he really didn't look good i mean granted he is you know 54 and there could 
[04:51:30]  be a lot of things going on there but uh i just it's just a shock and i feel sad for his family and  and i i hope uh i hope uh i i think it was good that uh wwe you know did what it's yeah it's good  that they buried the hatchet but it is sad that i mean he that dude loved his daughters yeah but also  do you think he looked bad before he died because oh when i said it earlier some people are looking  back and said look he looked like he was dying he looked like he was sick but you're looking back on  the fact that he did now die and now you're saying it i think hindsight has a lot to do with it i mean 
[04:52:00]  in like in hindsight now as i think about it i'm thinking to myself maybe he didn't look as good  this weekend as he did last year when i spoke to him right but that's also hindsight like i wasn't  when he was cutting the promo and he was go to shake the ropes and he would just it's just like he was  tapping in that and then stop he wasn't doing the full warrior but i don't think anybody thought  this guy is going to be dead within a day right i mean that shit is nuts uh that interview we're just  talking about is up on youtube you can search it out if you want to find it i'm posting a whole bunch of
