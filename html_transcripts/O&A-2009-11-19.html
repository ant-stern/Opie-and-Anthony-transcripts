<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in crude sexual banter before transitioning to a discussion about their sleep problems and eye strain from excessive screen time.  A caller, a licensed optician and truck driver, discussed eye dryness from screen use, suggesting a market for specialized gamer eyedrops.  The hosts then discussed the challenges older relatives face with technology like DVD players and cell phones, and another caller described convergence insufficiency and its treatment.  The conversation touched on the new Star Trek movie, Sacha Baron Cohen's films, and Anthony's new home security system, prompted by a local crime spree involving landscapers using loud mowers to mask burglaries.  They showed comedic YouTube and Twitter videos, including a failed Risky Business reenactment.  Multiple callers phoned in, most notably a “fugitive” who claimed to have stolen $10,000 and issued a bizarre ransom demand involving humiliating or harming Sam Roberts. The hosts attempted to identify the fugitive, while also discussing upcoming guest appearances by Patrice O’Neal and Ken Jeong, and engaging in further tangents, including disparaging comments about women from Buffalo.  A clip of Norton from his Jay Leno appearance was played.

The next segment featured a discussion, with guest Sam Roberts, about a staged Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair fight in Australia, presented as real by the Australian news media.  The hosts and Roberts dissected the staged "blood," mocked the news report's credulity, and discussed the financial struggles of Hogan and Flair, along with the current situations of other wrestlers like Brian Knobbs, Val Venis, and Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart.  Justin Credible's post-wrestling job at Olive Garden was also mentioned, as was Vince McMahon's control over name rights and its impact on wrestlers' finances.  The segment included further tangents: a disastrous interview with a publicist, Opie’s reaction to watching World War II footage in HD (leading to a morbid discussion about Japanese casualties),  movies, stand-up comedy, celebrity anecdotes, and a discussion about strip clubs.  Jimmy also appeared as a guest.  The segment concluded with mention of Patrice O'Neal's upcoming appearance.

A heavily vulgar segment followed, focusing on *The Wire*, a graphic video of a pregnant woman engaging in sexual acts, and a clip from Robert Pattinson's *Twilight* press tour, criticizing the publicist's intervention to prevent questions about his relationship with Kristen Stewart.  The hosts showed humorous videos of people injuring themselves, particularly women falling.  The fugitive called in repeatedly, making increasingly bizarre demands, including one involving E-Rock eating a cup of semen.  Patrice O'Neal appeared as a guest, bringing a shock collar which the hosts and guests (including "the Virus," a crew member) used as comedic punishment.  Numerous vulgar jokes and comments were made throughout this segment.

A segment focused on "the Virus," repeatedly shocked with the dog collar unless he delivered punchlines to prompts such as Walmart clothes, “Pajon,” Bert Nerny, and a Michael Jackson movie.  The hosts discussed E-Rock's failure to create a requested DVD.  The possibility of shocking E-Rock was debated, but ultimately dismissed due to past near-medical emergencies.  The conversation shifted to Thanksgiving, cooking methods for turkey, and a heated exchange with a caller about deep-fried turkey, culminating in a "Mean Jimmy" moment and a public service announcement about deep-frying dangers.

The show then discussed a rape joke on *The View*, followed by the Mythbusters' hot oil/water experiment.  Comedian Ken Jeong joined as a guest, and the hosts bantered with him about *Role Models*, *The Hangover* (including a nude scene), *Community*, and his career.  They discussed his experiences with Judd Apatow and other actors, including his work in *Knocked Up*, *Pineapple Express*, *Step Brothers*, and *Furry Vengeance*, and his strained relationship with T.J. Miller. Jeong revealed he had Brooke Shields' phone number.  The interview concluded with plugs for Jeong's shows and Patrice O’Neal’s stand-up.

A final segment featuring Ken Jeong started with a caller (possibly staged) recounting a wrestling injury.  The conversation focused on Jeong’s career, including his roles in *Knocked Up*, *Pineapple Express*, and *Step Brothers*, his stand-up described as a "BET comic as a Dr. Asian guy,"  his strained relationship with T.J. Miller over *Cloverfield*,  and his experiences working with Judd Apatow.  Jeong expressed a preference for working with friends and disliked the professional atmosphere of some film sets. The interview ended with plugs for his show *Community* and Patrice O’Neal’s stand-up.  Profanity and sexually suggestive humor were frequent throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, greediness.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of characters.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the Opie and Anthony Virus, and I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  It is time to broadcast.  Hello.  Good morning.  I'm having a...  I'm sorry.  No, I like those.  I'm having a hard time waking up this morning.  Yeah?  When I sleep, then it's harder to wake up.  Does that make sense?  Wow, that's kind of weird that when you sleep, it's harder to wake up than when you're not sleeping. 
[00:01:30]  Like when I get a really good sleep on.  Yeah.  I got my sleep on.  I woke up about an hour ago, but I still feel like I'm sleeping.  Yeah.  But then those nights where I'm just tossing and turning, tossing and turning, it's real  easy to get up, and then I don't feel like I'm tired when I'm in here.  Hmm.  Bizarre.  Yeah.  This sleep thing that we've talked about so many times, but it's just one of those things  when you keep these hours, it's impossible.  Yeah.  I went to sleep at 10.30 last night, and I'm exhausted, and I never go to sleep that early, 
[00:02:00]  but got in a little Call of Duty, a little bit.  That's why my eyes feel like someone's dumped sand in them.  That is just an eye wrecker.  You're staring at a screen, and you're making a billion slight little eye movements the whole  time, and like that guy said, I realized I hadn't blinked, because you're looking for  something.  You're looking for movement.  You're looking at it, and you realize, I'm not blinking. 
[00:02:30]  My eyes are drying up like fucking dates, like prunes.  It's great we have this awesome technology and all that, but are the eye doctors on this  to help us out a little bit?  Maybe come up with a nice eyedrop or something that we can pop in our gaming eyes?  I swear, I am digging into my eyes with my fingers, and just scratching, and then they  get runny.  I'm like a bulldog. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I've had a twitch in my left eye.  For real, underneath it?  I hate those.  Oh, yeah, just like, just constantly?  Yeah.  Because I'm just staring at my BlackBerry way too much, and I got a dumb Kindle, so  I'm reading books again off the Kindle, so everything is a screen.  Everything is a screen.  You're just looking at a screen.  And remember your parents telling you, don't sit so close to the television, you'll ruin  your eyes?  Oh, God.  I wish we were back to those days.  That was easy.  Now, in essence, what you're doing is holding a television inches from your face every ding-dong 
[00:03:30]  day.  I would love to know how many hours a day you're looking at a screen.  It's ridiculous.  The average person.  I mean, with our phones, our gaming, just regular computer shit.  It's my entire waking hours is spent looking at some type of screen.  Yeah.  When you think about it, even when you're driving, at some point you're looking at your  nav screen, you're looking at things.  No, I'm fucking texting.  Texting is another thing?  I'm a texting maniac when I drive. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my God.  What, Mars, you're the guy that doesn't text when he drives?  You're that guy.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  No texting.  Why?  You put the fucking, you put the phone with two hands through the steering wheel.  Oh, that's good.  I'm serious.  So when you go through the windshield.  Hell fucking no.  So you got your two hands through the steering wheel, and the phone is right in front of you,  pretty much on the dashboard.  Well, you're on a highway, so you don't really have to do much turning.  And then you're kind of looking at the road and fucking emailing and texting at the same  time.  It's like a heads-up display in a fighter, only you can't see through it. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, you're a wimp, Mars.  Get into the fucking texting thing on the road.  It rocks.  Although the iPhone does have that feature where you can turn your camera on, and that's  the background as you're texting.  So you hold it up, and you're seeing a video of the road.  Well, I got the cheap version of that.  You text that.  I got the cheap version of that.  You have to have your arms completely straight.  So that every officer can see you texting and give you a ticket.  Oh, well, if you really want to know the truth, I put it down below near the speedometer. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, damn.  So you can't see it at all.  So you can see how fast you're going when you hit something.  But at that point, you've got to kind of look up a lot.  Yeah.  But if I know there's no cops around, then it's right on the dashboard.  On the dash?  Oh, 80 miles an hour, and getting a lot of tweets done.  Well, that's...  Stop tweeting me, you assholes.  I'm going to be in an accident.  I'm guilty of it, too.  Everyone is.  I'm guilty of it.  I'm texting a lot of...  I do it one finger, though, like my thumb, and I'll be driving, look, and then occasionally 
[00:05:30]  glance down to my right, get a couple of letters in, and keep looking up.  You can't do that.  That's dumb.  To look all the way down to your right, that's where it gets dumb.  No, because then I'm still in my peripheral vision.  I can see the road.  That's what you should have.  Peripheral vision as you're fucking looking at the street.  You want eyeball info?  Eyeball info.  I'm scared to learn about the eyeballs today.  Dan in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:06:00]  I'm actually a licensed optician.  I'm a truck driver, as you know, already, but probably, but actually, you naturally blink  every, what, 8 to 12 seconds, but when you're focused on a monitor or something like that,  you could go up to 20 to 25 seconds without blinking, and your eye dries out, so you actually  have to make yourself blink if you're on a computer a lot.  I would think that there's a market for some kind of eyedrop for the gamers and the people  that really spend a lot of time just staring at their phones. 
[00:06:30]  I think better than an eyedrop, just a graphic that pops up on the game that says blink.  Yeah, blink.  That's a good question.  I think there might be an actual eyedrop that's a little thicker, more viscosity to it.  Cold cum.  Well, you might get actually, you know, you could actually use it, and I can't give you  that kind of, like, recommendation, because that's actually me diagnosing.  Well, you know what?  I got a home remedy, though. 
[00:07:00]  When I'm really doing a lot of gaming or freaking texting and whatnot, I get the Wesson  oil.  That's thick.  That's nice.  Dude, one drop of Wesson oil on each eye?  Smear it on your eyeball.  Oh, you're lubed up nice.  Please don't try this at home.  You're lubed up nice.  That's pretty good.  Professional comedian on a closed course.  Do not try this at home.  All right, Dan.  Yeah, ask somebody.  Yeah, there could be an eyedrop that has a little more thickness to it where it coats  your eye a little bit longer where it wouldn't dry out.  All right, thank you, sir. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you.  There's got to be an eyedrop, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to CVS and see.  There's got to be some kind of special eyedrop.  There has to be at this point.  I've seen eyedrops that have a prescription for chronic dry eye.  Yeah.  I have it, too.  Joe Balloonot makes a good point.  Joe Balloonot?  Yeah, the Joe Balloonot.  Wow.  Technology evolution is way ahead of human evolution.  I believe that.  Yeah, we're fucking ourselves up.  So basically, Joe's saying our eyes and our brains are going to explode.  Yeah, we're giving ourselves the tumors with the phone. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  If you actually make phone calls anymore.  But you probably give yourself like thumb tumors now from texting.  My phone rang yesterday, and I actually screamed.  I don't like, because mine makes the same sound as when a text comes in.  Yeah.  But it makes it once.  Like, well, it's a ding.  But the other thing, a voicemail, it'll make the same sound.  Yeah.  And then if it keeps going, it means it's ringing.  Uh-huh.  So when it keeps going, I'm just like, who the fuck?  I actually say like, who the fuck is calling me? 
[00:08:30]  And know why you say that with that anger?  Yeah.  Because the only people that call you are people that don't.  Don't text.  Well, no, they're not close enough to you.  Everyone that's close enough to me, we communicate through the BBM on the BlackBerry and the texting.  Yeah.  In general.  Yeah.  So when the phone rings, it's obviously a telemarketer, someone looking for a check, a doctor's appointment, that type of shit. 
[00:09:00]  Or older relatives.  I was going to say, or my mom.  Yeah.  Right.  That don't know what texting is all about.  They don't want to do it.  I don't know.  I don't understand that thing.  Yeah.  My mother, too.  Same thing.  Yeah.  And Sal.  Like, it could be done so easily, just think, think, think, think, a little text.  But it's got to be this protracted conversation.  My mom's place is filled with technology that she, it might as well be like, I don't know, artwork or something.  Refuse to use.  That's. 
[00:09:30]  We tried, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She has a whole bunch of stuff.  A cell phone that's never been turned on, a DVD player that's never been used.  Yeah.  All this stuff.  They just get, like, their cell phone is like the jitterbug.  It's just that big phone with the giant.  Oh, right.  With the buttons.  The giant readout and the big fucking display.  It doesn't do anything but call, like, 911.  But see, the cell phone industry is smart.  They figured out there is a market for, you know, old people having just a very basic phone. 
[00:10:00]  So, we talked about the DVD player.  Yeah.  Because of the menu and all that, like, older people don't understand that.  Yeah.  They understand, you know, a VHS player, you just push play and your movie starts.  Yeah.  There it is.  There should be a feature like that for the DVD players.  Yeah.  Just a quick push play.  I don't want options, menus, nothing.  Yeah.  I just want to watch this movie.  That's why they're still throwing VCR tapes in.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Because when my mom, we threw in one of our movies and all of a sudden the menu popped up. 
[00:10:30]  She was like, what is that?  I, I, I don't.  Is this now a computer?  I.  Yeah.  Especially those high-tech menus.  That's what I'm saying.  Where things are sliding out.  That's what I'm saying.  Sub-menus and shit like that.  They don't, how do I watch the movie?  I want to watch the picture, the program.  Yeah.  So, let's say hi to Joe in Albany.  Joe.  Hello, Joe.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, you guys are talking about the eyes. 
[00:11:00]  I got a thing I developed called chronic dry eye and convergence insufficiency.  And the fixed dry eye, you just use refreshed tears.  But the convergence insufficiency, you actually have to do push-ups with a pencil just to bring  the strength and the muscles to bring the eyes together.  What do you mean push-ups with a pencil?  You got to take a pencil and you stare at the eraser part of it.  Right.  You got to put it way up front of you and draw it in and force your eyes to come in.  Just from staring at monitors.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Going to get all, like, wall-eyed or something? 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  I've never heard of that before.  Yeah, it sucks, man.  You get a bug on your windshield when you drive it.  Your eyes focus on it.  It screws you all up.  I didn't know that.  Later, boys.  Thank you, Joe.  So, yeah, I'm hoping the twitching goes away eventually.  The twitch stops?  Jesus.  I just got to stop looking at all these screens for a while.  I grabbed a, I was telling you before, I just grabbed a bottle of wine last night, went  into the theater, and popped in that fucking Blu-ray Star Trek. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Looked great.  But again, I'm staring at a giant screen, so my eyes were just like, you're right, we  are just constantly looking at screens.  Yeah.  I haven't seen the Star Trek yet, because I'm not a Trekkie, but Abrams himself, when  he came in, said, you can watch this movie if you're not a fan.  It stands alone.  It's fun.  Great effects.  Yeah, I'm going to.  You know, if you are a Trek fan, it's funny.  Yeah.  You know, and shit like that. 
[00:12:30]  They got like little inside jokes from the episodes and the movies and stuff like that.  And it just, it looks amazing in Blu-ray on the big screen like that.  Fuck.  It's great.  Very cool.  Sitting there like a jackass.  Alone.  Watching my movies.  I was trying to find a movie last night, and it was Bruno.  Yeah.  And it was right there in demand.  I haven't seen it yet.  And then I'm like, nah.  I don't have a desire to see Bruno. 
[00:13:00]  No.  I actually got to get the Ali G tapes, because I'd never seen the show.  Yeah, the character.  Yeah, I'd rather see the Ali G, you know, before it got all, you know, cleaned up.  Yeah.  Because I think after all the problems he had with Borat, I mean, I read all the articles.  You know, they weren't doing, they weren't taking as many chances with his Bruno.  Yeah.  I haven't seen it yet either.  Really?  No.  I was kind of like, you know, I like the Borat character.  Yeah.  I don't want to fuck Bruno.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Gay people scare us.  We're frightened.  We're frightened.  The Easy Play DVD player is made by Fisher-Price.  Ah.  So you've got to get a kid's toy.  Wait, I've got to hear what Chuck has to say.  Chuck.  It all comes around.  My four-year-old's got one.  Huh?  My four-year-old's got one.  Yeah.  It's a little portable DVD player that's made by Fisher-Price.  Just push play or stop.  But what about the menus on these DVDs? 
[00:14:00]  They just know not to pop that up on the screen?  Yep.  See that?  Because that's...  Huh.  It's simple for kids, you know.  And it's just a little portable one.  They can drop it and everything like that, kick it around, or they see how it does and  skip or nothing.  Just like old people.  So, yeah, but imagine you give your mom a Fisher-Price DVD player for Christmas.  Wouldn't even know.  Oh, really?  They wouldn't even realize, oh, thanks, what's this?  Really?  Yeah.  Well, that way she can sit there and hold it up closer to her, too, you know?  Yeah.  True.  I didn't know they made that. 
[00:14:30]  Thank you, Chuck.  Hey, Anthony was telling me about a scam just before the show, too.  Ooh.  And the brilliance of this is just amazing.  It's something that the people out there should look out for, probably.  In suburbia.  Another element of crime in suburbia.  What's going on?  Well, I have my alarm, my alarm guys have been at the house making it a virtual locked  down facility compound.  Yes, yes.  It is like Scarface's house now. 
[00:15:00]  I'm talking cameras, all kinds of shit where I could just pop online and see what's happening  at my house.  Do you sit around and just check out the cameras while you're home?  I sit in the office sometimes and I just scroll through my different cameras.  All right.  We'll look at that.  We'll look at this.  This camera.  That one.  What was the movie about the security guy in the building in Manhattan?  That was a sick fucking thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he's just in his room looking at all the, you know, the security cameras of all the 
[00:15:30]  apartments.  What the hell was the name of that movie?  I remember that one.  Wasn't one of the Baldwins in it, right?  Was it Stephen Baldwin?  No, it wasn't Stephen.  Billy, maybe?  Maybe Billy Baldwin?  Someone will pop it up, I'm sure.  I'm just thinking that's you in a dark room.  Do you have a wall of screens?  Sliver, right?  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you, Random Listener.  Random Listener, thank you.  It's the name, Random Listener.  Oh, really?  That's funny.  Yeah, it says Random Listener.  He knows his place.  I like that. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, and...  Do you have a wall of screens?  Not yet.  You should get a wall of screens.  Wall of screens.  That would be cool.  No, I got the monitor, so I pop them up and I just, I look around.  And now before I, you know, before I leave the house, I can check outside, make sure there's  no fucking shenanigans going on.  Sure.  Which is good, so I do that.  And it's great, but the alarm guys have been outside the house for a while now, because  they're up there on ladders and shit against the house, popping up cameras with the little 
[00:16:30]  smoked glass domes.  Oh, sweet.  They're all over the place.  It looks sick.  Right.  Don't fuck with me.  Don't fuck with me.  Scanners.  And Nassau County cop, a couple of days in a row, pulls up and asks them, yeah, there they  are, asks them what they're doing.  Because there's been a lot of break-ins in the area.  In your area?  Yes.  Really.  Which gets me like, aha, see, I told you so.  Well, before you continue your story, Joe, Blue Knot writes, you're more paranoid than 
[00:17:00]  the entire nation of Israel.  Kind of like that line.  Well, I pretty much am living in Israel, so it's my neighbors.  Mini Israel.  Mini Israel.  So, a lot of break-ins in the neighborhood.  Yeah, they said there's been some break-ins in the area.  And they questioned the alarm guy, you know, because he's got a van and a ladder, and you  could just have a van painted something on the side and ladders, and you're fucking around.  And then they tell them what the scam is that's going on. 
[00:17:30]  There's landscapers in all these suburban neighborhoods.  You see them all the time.  It's just a truck with a trailer with some fucking mowers in the back.  And you don't know, because everybody's got, like, different landscapers, you don't know  whose landscaper it is, or even if it's yours.  I couldn't tell one landscaper from the next if he's hopping on a lawnmower and zipping  around my house.  So, what they've been doing is taking a lawnmower, and then they go into someone's house, or  around someone's house, where obviously they're not home, and crank up a very loud lawnmower 
[00:18:00]  so they can bust windows and sliding glass door glass without anyone hearing it, because  the lawnmower's so loud.  And then he's zipping around the house like the lookout, mowing the lawn, as someone's  ransacking the fucking house.  That's a perfect scam.  It really is.  Holy shit.  Yeah, because no one's going to hear.  If you hear, like, shattering a huge sliding glass door busting open, a neighbor might go, 
[00:18:30]  like, what the fuck is that, and take a look over the fence, or whatever.  Of course, of course.  But if you hear a lawnmower, you're constantly hearing lawnmowers in the neighborhood.  And some of those lawnmowers you could hear, like, a half mile away.  Yeah, they're very loud.  It's unbelievable.  That's like a hell of a scam.  That's a great scam.  Yeah.  Are the cops onto it a little bit?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How are they going to figure that one out?  Well, they drive around, and that's what they're doing.  They're questioning any vans or any, you know, landscape trucks, maintenance vehicles,  box trucks that are parked outside of houses. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  And they ask them what they're doing.  They ask them for some kind of ID and shit like that, and then they're on their way,  which is nice.  I like that.  And I like the fact that they did it two days in a row with the alarm guys.  Oh, they're looking for somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  They're looking for somebody.  That's what I'm thinking.  Something's going on.  But I could just sit there, and I could even pull up the house on the iPhone now.  That's cool.  I could pull up all my little cameras and flip through them.  The Paranoid app?  I'm like, yeah, it's called the Paranoid Anthony app, and you could just fiddle through them. 
[00:19:30]  That's cool.  See, who's at my front door?  Who's at my front door?  I could run my alarm system off my iPhone.  Very good.  From remote locations.  Lock down my panic room.  It's Paranoid.  You're good to go.  That's great.  Yeah, that's true.  Let's be honest here.  It was a freak.  Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  You know, the problem is with all security and all that guns, Danny's just going to walk  up behind you and knife you anyway. 
[00:20:00]  God damn it.  You know it's going to be an inside job eventually.  Inside job.  Danny or Keith or somebody.  It's just going to be an inside job.  This is all a waste.  With a knife, like you fucking call it duty.  Ken in New Hampshire.  Ken.  Yeah, one time when I was younger, basically, there was a wealthier house in the neighborhood  and got one day during the day, broad daylight, and just pulled a bunch of guys, pulled a  moving truck up outside of the guy's house, unloaded the guy's entire house, and just pulled 
[00:20:30]  away.  Nobody thought a thing of it.  God damn, that's some scary stuff.  Yeah.  I guess we all need the alarm systems now, huh?  And the guy was wealthy, so we didn't think anything of it.  Like, I actually saw the moving truck, but you don't think anything of it, because you're  like, oh, it must be moving.  You know, if you're that guy and you come home from work, though, you've got to respect the  fact that you're walking into your empty house.  You've got to respect that.  Like, wow. 
[00:21:00]  Wow, they've got a lot done in eight hours.  Yeah, like, wow, that would have taken me forever to move.  Is this modern warfare getting boring yet?  No, I was playing last night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The graphics are good.  This is in-game right here that I'm looking at?  Oh, yeah.  Why the fuck does Tiger Woods Golf have shitty graphics?  Why can't we have graphics like this?  It's so sick.  What is this guy doing?  This video is on YouTube.  It's called Modern War Fail.  Yeah.  And it's just people, like, just noobs getting owned. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, that's great.  Owned.  Yeah.  There's a fucking video for everything now.  This guy's just been running around planting C4 next to people camping out.  He just plants C4 and blows them up.  Did you see the Risky Business?  That's fantastic.  Jesus.  Oh, you dumb son of a bitch.  Noob.  Just noobs getting wrecked.  There you go.  Did you guys see the Risky Business Fail video? 
[00:22:00]  Yes, I have.  Colin Cain, a pretty funny comedian.  Got to get him on the show.  We got to figure out how to get Colin Cain on here.  Yeah.  I like the guy.  He's a young comedian.  I see him at Caroline's all the time.  He tweeted the Risky Business video.  I mean, it's making the rounds, but that's where I found it.  Check this out.  It's on my Twitter, Opie Radio, if you want to watch it yourself.  They're reenacting.  Oh, shit. 
[00:22:30]  Reenacting Risky Business.  She slides into the room, and then her friend slides into the room.  Right on her head on the wood floor.  I've watched this a few times, and where they make their mistake is that they're not wearing socks.  They're just sliding across the floor.  They greased the floor.  It's obvious they greased the floor to get a really nice slide going.  What are they, stupid?  Yeah, because the...  Yeah.  Now, the one girl falls and just slams her head onto the wood floor.  They're young.  Dude, they're so hot.  Yeah, well... 
[00:23:00]  Someone's got to take this video and do the fall over and over again to a beat.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Is she, is she, uh, or is she's tending to her?  Yeah, now the one girl's bending over.  Oh.  She just has panties on and the Risky Business, like, fucking, uh, shirt on.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  This is the hottest fucking thing I've ever seen.  Yeah, now she's getting up to try to help her friends.  She's got her panties on.  The back of her shirt pulled up.  Now she lays a blanket on the ground because the floor is so slippery. 
[00:23:30]  She goes, lay on that.  Oh, shit.  And then she tries to run to get help or whatever, and she's almost falling because, like Danny  said, they greased up the floor.  And now the really hot teenager runs to the camera and turns it off.  That video.  That's hysterical.  She slides in nice.  Second one.  Oh, fuck.  The more you watch it, the funnier it gets. 
[00:24:00]  You like that?  Yeah, but.  Oh, does she go on her ass?  But someone has to fucking react to this thing.  Her mic goes.  Oh, Danny has pretty much react to this thing.  Keep going, Danny.  Keep going.  That is so loud, man. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, she slams her head.  She hits the deck, man.  Yeah, it's classic.  And then Colin Cain, he goes, if you don't find this funny, I don't want to be friends  with you.  I'm like, great line, brother.  It's funny and hot.  It really is hot.  At the same time.  Because what?  They're like, look at that scene.  How old do you think they are?  Because the one girl's tall, so it's deceiving.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They got to be, what, 16?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  High school. 
[00:25:00]  In their panties and long white dress shirts.  But the one girl runs out of the scene, and now she's a cartoon character with the feet  going, whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  She's trying to run, but she can't get traction.  Right.  And her face just.  Yeah, she's in a panic, like, I don't know what to do.  Where's mommy to help me?  Oh, does she go down?  You like that one?  That's fantastic.  The other one I retweeted last night was, ah, you guys aren't hockey fans, but it might  be worth checking out. 
[00:25:30]  A hockey fail.  Guy scores an amazing goal, and then watch how he celebrates the goal.  Just got to get to my Twitter.  I think it's right.  Tweety.  Yeah, it's right there.  All right.  This is quick.  If you go to OP Radio on Twitter, you'll see these videos.  The guy makes an amazing goal.  Ain't got no cash.  Ain't got no style.  Ain't got no gas.  Sick goal.  They show it three or four times.  The other guy's trying to celebrate.  Watch what happens. 
[00:26:00]  He jumps up in the air.  He wants to, like, kind of jump onto the glass, and the glass gives out, and he goes falling  through it.  Yeah, he wants to kind of bounce off of the fucking wall.  Yeah.  Like, jump up, bounce off the wall, and keep skating, and he went right through the fucking  glass.  Right through it.  After an amazing goal.  What an ass.  Those are the two videos I enjoyed last night.  Those are good ones.  Psychotic.  Is that how you say it? 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  They want to know if that video is live from the compound.  The two girls.  Oh, yes.  The two girls.  Grease the floor.  Actually, yes.  Similar things have happened with socks and the tile floor.  Oh, that's true.  Ron in Oregon.  Ron?  Hey, I was going to ask Anthony why he's wasted all that money on the video system.  He could have got Keith one camera, and he would have videotaped him stealing all his  stuff. 
[00:27:00]  Good point.  Did Keith ever give you an explanation?  No.  Why would he?  Are you still confused by that?  Very confused.  Okay, good.  As to why he would tape that.  Good.  You're still sane.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Edward in Texas.  Edward.  Anthony, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that blacks aren't really trying to rob  you.  It could be any race of people, sir.  Don't just pick a race. 
[00:27:30]  I understand criminals come in every package.  Let's say hi to Dean.  What's up, Dean?  Hey, Anthony.  In Pennsylvania today, they're voting on their version of the Castle Doctrine.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's going to extend past the person's home, into their car, and basically on their  body to protect them or their family with the use of deadly force without fear of civil, 
[00:28:00]  you know, getting sued by the perp.  This should absolutely be in every state.  It's ridiculous, the thought that you can't protect yourself without the threat looming  over your head that you're going to be sued by the family or the person that gets injured  or something when they're trying to perpetrate a crime against you.  Yeah, what is going on?  I was telling you before the show, I'm just so frustrated that the system is broke.  Yeah, it really is.  I don't understand half this shit anymore.  Really, really.  I obviously didn't understand most of this shit to begin with, but someone breaks in your 
[00:28:30]  home and you should just be able to fucking kill them.  Yeah, and it's your property.  If you do, they do a...  There shouldn't be any question whatsoever.  I don't care if the guy goes, holy shit, I made a mistake, I don't want to do this anymore.  Well, you should have thought of that before you broke the window into my house.  Yep.  That's part of what they're writing in, that the act of someone breaking into your house  is enough to fear for your life.  It should be.  Absolutely.  Somebody breaking into your house. 
[00:29:00]  You don't know what their intent is, so you definitely would have the thought that  perhaps he's there to do bodily harm to you or your loved ones.  Yeah.  So you don't have to sit there and wonder and then wait until, what, he shoots first or  stabs somebody in your family before you can do something?  Fuck that.  See, I go completely the other way, man.  The guy breaks in, right, does all sorts of shit, and now he's leaving your house and  he's running away.  You should be able to shoot him in the back. 
[00:29:30]  You should be able to shoot him in the back after he's off your property.  You should be able to shoot him in the back as he's trying to get into his car.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Yep.  It's insane.  How do you get in trouble for protecting yourself because someone breaks into your house?  Makes no sense.  It doesn't, right?  No.  So as a gun owner, you have to figure out, if I take a shot at this guy, I've got to  make sure he's still facing me?  Yeah, you've got to make sure that you felt that your life was being threatened. 
[00:30:00]  Well, don't you feel that as soon as the window breaks while you're watching a movie with  your family or whatever you're doing?  You would think so, but what are you going to do?  So if you shoot someone in the back, you're fucked, right?  For the most part.  Unless you saw, there could be a case where if you shoot him in the back because you see  he's drawing for a weapon and starting to turn, like maybe you saw his arm come out  with a weapon in it and he's starting to turn toward you, so you blast him in the back. 
[00:30:30]  So you've got to get a CSI team to figure it out for you.  Yeah, blood spatter fucking investigation.  They'll figure it out for you that whether you were a threat or not, how the body fell  and where the fucking blood sprayed.  Where his gun is laying.  Oh, great.  Where the shell cases are.  All that happy horse shit comes into play as to whether you'll be indicted or not.  Right.  Or have to go to civil court and lose everything because you're protecting yourself. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Jimmy's landing.  What?  He did Leno last night.  We'll give people a taste going into break here.  Also, I posted a pretty good behind the scenes video of Anthony and one of these.  Oh.  I called them the cleavage broads.  I haven't seen that one yet.  From the Tony Clifton appearance.  Yes.  Where the one girl realized she forgot her pocketbook.  This was after the show or after their segment.  And Anthony returned the pocketbook and fun ensued. 
[00:31:30]  We returned the pocketbook after we had to find out whose it was.  Yeah.  And you were very excited when you found out it was the one girl's pocketbook that you  kind of thought was perfect for you.  And you have to find out whose it is by maybe opening it up and taking a peek inside.  Yeah.  And the fans are analyzing the video.  Oh, you should have seen what was in there.  Oh, you looked?  What was in there?  Well, there might have been some prescription drugs in there. 
[00:32:00]  How many?  Is that a bad one?  I don't know.  Well, unless you're taking it and enjoying it, then it's a good one.  What is that for?  Did you write it down?  For feeling good.  No, I understand that.  But what was the fake reason?  You didn't look at the reason or anything like that.  I mean, why would you take that particular drug?  All right.  It is for...  You don't have to say it if that's like... 
[00:32:30]  Synthetic opiate.  It's an opiate.  Yeah.  I knew she was fucked up.  I knew she was fucked up.  Derived from...  Commonly available in tablets, capsules, syrup.  What is it?  A particulate.  Yeah, what is...  Commonly used as an intermediate strength, centrally acting analgesic.  What does it do, though?  It's a painkiller.  It's just...  It's a painkiller?  Yeah, it's like a super heavy-duty painkiller.  She's too young to be in any pain.  No, no, it's...  See, she's trying to cure mental pain, is what I think. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, well...  That's fantastic.  But Anthony returning the pocketbook.  It's a pretty good video on OP Radio on YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  She fit the bill perfectly.  But this is what I wanted to tell you.  So I've been reading the comments, and one guy said, and I agree with him, that at the  end of the video, she kind of pauses.  I think she was waiting for you to make some kind of move.  Yeah, I...  For real.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:33:30]  Because you, like...  There was a whole thing that happened, and then, like, it was time to go back and do  the show.  And instead of her turning around and walking back toward Tony Clifton, she was almost  like, help me.  Get me away from him.  Oh, yeah.  I, you know...  I kind of...  I had to get back to the show.  I had a read to do that I missed.  That was an accurate comment, whoever wrote it.  I was like, yeah, I think she was sort of waiting for the big move.  Well...  Like, you know, what's your number?  What are you doing?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing at 11 when I get off the air? 
[00:34:00]  I'm just thinking, you know, she hangs out with Tony Clifton.  It's kind of like...  God, dude, please.  It's part of the act.  He rents those whores.  But he's...  Like, where does...  Would she live somewhere, you know?  Oh, my God.  She's probably not even in town.  Dude, she's in town for the day.  Well, I know.  That'd be nice, but...  What are you talking about?  You don't want a girlfriend, you said.  No, no.  I don't want that.  That was perfect.  It'd be nice to make a visit.  Visit the house.  Yeah, get a hotel room and... 
[00:34:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, but the house is good.  Do the right thing.  The house...  The house makes me more attractive.  See?  I need...  I need the house.  You understand?  So when you're in your house, you're like a 10?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, not a 10, but, you know, I get brought up a few levels just from the house.  What are you just walking around the streets?  Oh, God, I don't know.  I'm fucking foot three.  You know, walking around the street. 
[00:35:00]  But the house makes you more like an eight.  Yeah, the house puts me in eight territory.  Believe me.  And then once they go to the bar and have a few drinks, start looking through beer goggles.  Yeah.  And then they'd look around at that house and go, this is fucking nice.  I've said it a few times, man.  Don't ever go to Miami Beach.  Yeah.  That one fucking street, I forgot.  I think it has Ocean in its name.  You walk that street and you realize you're a genetic disaster.  Yeah.  There's perfection down there.  The people are so good looking down there that you just get instantly depressed walking that street in Miami. 
[00:35:30]  It's Miami Beach.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Ocean Drive, huh?  And what's a city we could all move to where we would all be like just fucking tens?  I would think somewhere.  Like we need up in Maine.  Maine?  Yeah.  Somewhere up in Maine where there's like loggers.  Like we need to be around a bunch of loggers.  I don't know.  Because they'll all be in shape from carrying logs all day.  You think?  And the logging look would be in. 
[00:36:00]  See, you've got to find a city that's just kind of a city that doesn't have an industry.  Like I'm sure the women love the logging look in those areas.  We need like a Des Moines.  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  We've been to Cleveland.  There's no one there.  Cleveland has sort of a hip area.  That's a problem.  You need an area like, I'm starting to think Des Moines.  Des Moines.  You want to go to Des Moines?  It's just kind of there.  Yeah.  The industry isn't like, holy shit, we've got to go to Des Moines.  Like Danny enjoys a trip to Austin, Texas every once in a while, right? 
[00:36:30]  Austin is happening.  Des Moines is just kind of there.  You don't hate it.  You don't love it.  Pop up a picture of the Des Moines skyline.  Let me see if this is enough.  We would be fucking, we would be models in Des Moines.  All right, let me see.  That's their skyline?  Yeah.  See, it's just.  Oh, shit.  There's nothing there, dude.  We would rule.  We would rule Des Moines.  That's like fucking.  Let's move this.  If you live on Long Island, that's Melville. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  It's the mall.  It's the mall.  Yeah, the skyline's a mall.  Yeah, I know.  I said pocketbook.  I didn't know what the fuck that bag thing should be.  It was a purse, a pocketbook, a fucking bag.  What do they call it?  Let's call it a bag.  We should just move the whole show to Des Moines, Iowa.  We would be like the Beatles, man.  We would be rock stars.  We would rule in Des Moines.  If we were willing to just pick up and go.  And believe me, I bet money goes pretty fucking far in Des Moines. 
[00:37:30]  Shit.  When you're used to shelling out New York bucks.  I would buy a public school if I went to Des Moines, Iowa.  Just buy a school?  And kick all the kids out.  As a farm system?  No, just kick.  Well, you would keep the kids in it.  I would kick all those little fuckers out of there and then redesign into just an amazing  facility.  I'd buy a school.  Have my own gym.  Like a farm system.  Walk through.  You see a fat or an ugly girl.  You just snap their neck and throw them out back like with chickens.  It's like this one's not healthy.  I would love to buy a school. 
[00:38:00]  You'd have your own fucking gym where they put the plays on.  There's your home theater.  You think you have a good home theater.  So you buy a school and live in it.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Your cafeteria would be your kitchen.  Yeah.  Think about it.  Huge.  Think about it.  Think about it.  This is the Harrington house.  Oh, Des Moines all gay.  All right.  We got to stay away from Des Moines.  Des Moines all gay?  Well, that means more girls for us, though.  See? 
[00:38:30]  That is a good...  Well, maybe they're lesbies.  Oh.  And the age of consent is 16, Ann.  All right.  Is it really?  Book it.  Book it.  We're going to Des Moines.  Des Moines, Iowa.  We are going to Des Moines.  But you can't be more than four years older.  Oh.  Until when?  18?  Until 18, I guess.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  That's that four-year-older law.  What's the youngest age of consent state?  Come on.  16.  Where is it? 
[00:39:00]  It can't go lower than 16.  It's got to be.  It's all 16.  It's all 16.  Yeah, what sixth state would go lower than 16?  The greatest state ever.  Ever.  Chris in Memphis writes, come to Memphis, you'll be rock stars.  No, Memphis is happening?  Yeah.  Isn't Memphis happening?  Memphis, yeah.  A rock scene?  Memphis has like a music scene.  And a country music scene.  Yeah, yeah.  And an Elvis scene.  You're going to look like Elvis to be in Memphis.  Yeah.  Oh, if we move to Arkansas, we'll be a 10. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, Arkansas?  Yeah.  That could be.  Yeah.  It was one of those real southern kind of, you know, spooky states where it gets a little  creepy.  Yeah.  And then you can move to certain areas, like the whole state itself, there could be a cool  part of the state, but you just go to the uncool part.  Yeah.  Like, you know, West Virginia has some places, I guess, that are nice.  But if you go, like, into the boonies of West Virginia, you are fucking styling. 
[00:40:00]  Well, Sarah from Buffalo, I almost agree with her.  Buffalo?  Oh, how do I get over there?  Sarah from Buffalo writes, uh, where the fuck is she there?  Sarah, where the fuck you go?  Sarah!  Oh, my God, the feedback.  Okay.  Sorry, oh, Buffalo.  You can easily rule in Buffalo.  I was in Buffalo, and I did well in Buffalo.  You ruled?  But with...  But the problem is, you do well with, uh, women that we nicknamed Buffalo Bettys. 
[00:40:30]  Buffalo Bettys, yeah.  There weren't a lot of good-looking women.  Holy shit.  I'm sorry.  What happened?  There is...  They're showing, like, I guess, the Jets cheerleaders or something.  They're practicing?  Dude, there is a blonde on here that is so fucking hot.  Right there, right?  Oh, God.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  They're called the Jets Flight Crew?  The Flight Crew?  The Jets Flight Crew?  Ew.  They're really fucking smoking, though, some of these chicks.  Oh, whore. 
[00:41:00]  Look at these whores.  What are they practicing?  Yeah, stop.  All they have to do is twirl and show their kids.  Just jump around.  What are they practicing?  I don't know.  What are they doing?  The Jets Flight Crew?  Oh, my God.  That's hot.  Yeah, they're Buffalo Bettys in Buffalo.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a lot of good-looking women.  So...  But you can bang a lot of Buffalo Bettys up there.  But it becomes... 
[00:41:30]  Like the ratio gets fucked up.  You might be better in Buffalo.  You might be like, you know, an eight in Buffalo.  But the Buffalo Bettys bring the average down because there's only so many good-looking chicks.  Yeah.  And they're looking for the tens.  I can't tell you how many oversized Bills sweatshirts I had to pull off Buffalo Bettys.  Oh, God.  Do you mind if I stretch out one of your shirts?  Yeah, take one.  It's in the closet.  But, you know, sometimes there was a nice surprise underneath. 
[00:42:00]  They weren't as big as they looked in their big oversized Buffalo sweatshirts.  Oh, really?  Smack that ass.  Buffalo Bill.  Smack that fat ass.  Why don't we take a break?  Norton's going to join the show.  I think everybody's joining the show today.  We got...  Oh, no.  Okay.  We...  All right.  I know what we did.  That's good.  Patrice O'Neill's going to be here today.  And Ken Jeong from Role Models, from The Hangover, from that new show, Community.  He was the king in Role Models, right? 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  Really cool dude.  The king at the LARPing thing.  And when you meet him, there you go.  There's a Buffalo Betty.  That's a Buffalo Betty right there.  Yeah, because you've got to dress warm.  After a few beers, you'd do it.  Sure.  There were some nice surprises, because fucking Buffalo's so cold, everyone has to dress in...  Layers.  Yeah, layers.  And you take some of those layers off, and it's a nice surprise.  You just hope that fucking...  Go up...  Yeah, let me see the...  Yeah, let me see her in the corner.  Is she just a slob? 
[00:43:00]  No, she's chubby, but...  That's chubby hot.  And it's like dominatrix shit.  Chubby.  There's something called chubby hot.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to be proportioned, is what it is.  Is that what it comes down to, you think?  Yeah, proportionality.  Go back one, because I think there was something else.  Yeah, what's that chick laying down?  Is she a fatty?  On the bottom?  With her legs spread open?  Yeah.  What a mess.  That's all right.  Yeah, she's a mess, though. 
[00:43:30]  That's all right, because that's young chub.  Young chub's okay.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah, you'd jump on that.  So we got Patrice, we got Ken Jeong coming in, so we got a busy show.  We're going to go to break with Norton on Leno last night.  A little taste of Norton doing his thing for Jay Leno last night.  Yeah.  We'll continue.  O.P. and Anthony.  Do you want to pick a topic?  Carrie Prejean or Prejean, or however you say her name.  Carrie Prejean recently dropped a lawsuit against the Miss California Panjent after a solo sex tape she made was introduced.  When Larry King asked Prejean about the settlement, she chastised him. 
[00:44:00]  Take a look.  In mediation, it was discussed why you were mediating.  Larry, it's completely confidential.  And you're being inappropriate.  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Inappropriate King Live continues.  Yes.  But who was being inappropriate?  Since then, seven more sex tapes and 30 nude photos have surfaced.  Prejean attended a Christian university, I believe, when these tapes were being made.  Now a porn company has a copy of the tape and wants to release them with or without her permission. 
[00:44:30]  Is she a hypocrite or misguided?  And would you watch the tape?  Yes, I would watch it.  I'd watch the tape until I had tennis elbow.  Megan?  Um, no disrespect to Larry King, but it's not exactly like Mike Wallace was hounding her.  I mean, that's why you walk off the set?  I know.  He's so lame.  He's asking about a lawsuit.  And she's like, I'm going to leave.  And I was like, girl, there are going to be a lot harder questions going to answer when those 30 nude photos and 12 sex tapes come out afterward. 
[00:45:00]  Diablo?  I feel like we're attacking this girl for the wrong reason.  Like, we should attack her because she's, like, an entitled, smug brat, not because she showed her no-no on tape.  Adam, you got something, uh...  Nothing for her but my fantasy.  Like, if I was in the Make-A-Wish Foundation, my fantasy would be to grab Larry King's suspender, draw it back like a bow, let it go, and just see him turn into a pile of dust.  Well, that's it.  We got to go, folks. 
[00:45:30]  That's all the time we have.  Anthony, we got someone very mysterious on the phone lines.  Uh-oh.  They're not giving their name.  They're very mysterious.  Oh, what time is it?  Hello, sir.  You're going to have a call.  I have stolen $10,000 from Mel Crisis, Dan.  You stole $10,000 from where?  Mel Carcistan. 
[00:46:00]  From Mel Carcistan.  Mel Carcistan?  Who's Mel Carcistan?  I'm in charge of the company.  I have stolen the money.  If you want it back, I'm going to have to humiliate Sam Roberts, light his hair on fire.  Wow.  Wait, you're going to light Sam's hair on fire if we don't do what?  Oh, you guys have to do it if you want the money back.  Is this the fugitive?  Oh, no.  It's the fugitive, Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  If we want the money back, we got to set Sam Roberts' hair on fire.  That sounds a little dangerous.  Yeah, fugitive.  That's scary.  Or dump peanut butter on it.  And gum.  Why would we?  You can't dump peanut butter on somebody, fugitive.  That's very hard to do.  You could put gum on it.  Gum.  Gum in Sam Roberts' hair and then we get the money back fugitive?  Yeah.  Well, you know how this works when they do it at other stations. 
[00:47:00]  You need to give us a clue.  Of who you are.  Yeah, of who you are so we can find the fugitive.  So give us a clue.  I was born in what is now known as New York Hospital, Queens.  Back then it was called Booth Memorial Hospital.  Boy, I don't know who the fugitive is.  Do you it?  No.  Wow. 
[00:47:30]  Could we ask for another clue, fugitive?  Yeah, one more clue.  I graduated Hillcrest Play School.  Hillcrest Play School.  Where is that?  Yeah, where is that?  I'm in Jamaica, Queens.  Everything is Queens.  He's never left Queens.  Uh, fugitive, can I ask you, um, what, what borough of New York do you live in now? 
[00:48:00]  Uh, I live in Queens.  What's happening, fugitive?  Yeah, what happened, fugitive?  No, nothing, nothing.  I actually, the dog had just walked a little bit too, the dog walked a little bit too.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[00:48:30]  other channels at SiriusXM, because we're done.  We can't beat that.  Fugitive, what happened?  Oh, never mind.  A dog just walked ahead of me right before I was about to start crossing. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, okay.  Wow, we just learned something new.  Scared shitless of dogs.  Oh, the dog was scared.  The dog was scared of the fugitive?  No, the dog was scared.  Something just scared the dog that passed by.  Okay, fugitive.  Well, I'm getting some intel here about the fugitive, Anthony.  Someone is saying that the fugitive's brother may have anally raped him. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, my God, fugitive.  Is that true?  No, it never happened.  Really?  No, it never happened.  A lot of people have said that that happened, that the fugitive got raped.  By his brother.  And fugitive, where are you right now?  I'm in the Queen's.  I'm in the Queen's. 
[00:50:00]  He's in Queens.  Of course.  Yes, yes.  I think the fugitive's lying.  I don't think he's in Queens.  Yeah.  I'm not lying.  God damn.  All right, so fugitive, what do we have to do to get our money back?  The 202 fugitive wants you to put gum in Sam Roberts here in front of right by one of the Rockefeller Center trees. 
[00:50:30]  By the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.  I don't think the tree's up yet, is it?  Well, yeah.  Oh, they put it up?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, wow, fugitive.  Where do you work?  I do moving in stores part-time.  Where, though?  In Connecticut. 
[00:51:00]  In Connecticut for my sister's father.  Oh, in Connecticut for your sister's father.  Sister's father?  Wouldn't that be your father?  Oh, he needs the same father.  More clues as to who the fugitive is.  More clues.  I like that.  But I can't figure it out.  No, can you?  This is so hard to figure out who the fugitive is.  Me and my sister only share one parent.  Oh, really?  Hmm.  They only share one parent. 
[00:51:30]  Fugitive.  Let me ask you a question.  I'm trying to hone in on who this is.  Um, uh, how many dick surgeries have you had?  Very good question.  I've had 48.  48 dick surgeries.  Wow.  Wow, who could this be?  I don't know, man.  I'm confused.  This is tough.  We've got a lot of fugitives calling.  Yeah.  All right, fugitives.  So, are you going to call back with another, like, clue? 
[00:52:00]  I'm going to call back.  It ain't 30.  Why?  What?  I'm going to call back at 830.  Oh, you're going to call back at 830.  Okay.  And, uh, by the way, we have officially put gum in Sam Roberts' hair.  Yes.  So, I guess you just got to come and give us our money back now.  Oh, I'm going to call you back at 830.  All right, there goes the fugitive. 
[00:52:30]  I have to.  Is there any way you can fucking get that piece?  Yeah, we got to replay that.  We got to hear when he completely lost the voice.  All right, let's hear it, Travis.  Uh, fugitive.  Can I ask you, um, what borough of New York do you live in now?  Uh, I live in Queens.  What's happening, fugitive? 
[00:53:00]  What happened, fugitive?  No, no, no, nothing.  Nothing.  I actually, the dog had just walked a little bit too.  The dog walked a little bit too.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  He's brilliant.  That motherfucker is brilliantly stupid.  The dog walked into it.  That dog walked into it.  Oh, I love it.  God damn. 
[00:53:30]  I know Sam is, uh, getting the gum out of his hair, but could he come in here?  Because we got a wrestling thing.  Yes.  Oh, my goodness.  I don't believe that this is, uh, true.  But Sam is saying it is.  Well, we got the audio.  Has to do with wrestling.  Well.  My God, Sam will know.  Well, I guess Ric Flair.  We talked about this on the show.  Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan are doing a big thing in Australia.  I guess they're fighting wrestling matches all over Australia.  It's a big thing.  I am.  For the, for the people down under.  Right?  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  What are they doing?  10 or 12 wrestling shows around the country or something?  Yeah.  Uh, Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair both happen to have, uh, divorce financial issues.  Uh-huh.  So around that same time, they announced the Hulkamania tour.  Right.  Where they're going to go around Australia wrestling.  And try to make some money.  Try to make some of that money.  Try to make some of their money back.  Divorce money, uh, yeah.  Right.  Divorce money tour.  And I guess they had a press conference.  Yes.  Like they do.  And there was a fake fight, right?  Well, there was, I was watching the news this time. 
[00:54:30]  You always say, well, why don't you watch the real news?  Yeah.  And this, it was a real fight.  I mean, the news said it was, the Australian press said it was real.  I know.  That's right.  So, a fight at a wrestling press conference.  Sam, I love your take on things.  Uh-huh.  But, uh, I need, I need the actor that plays.  Okay.  Well, uh, because, because, are you trying to tell me that, you know wrestling? 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  It was definitely a fake fight.  Yeah.  The Australian news covered it as if they had gotten the news from primetime Sam Roberts himself.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  So, the fight itself at the press conference was fake.  Of course it was fake.  To get a little talk going, right?  Yes.  And the news down in Australia really believed that it was a real fight.  Yeah.  That's the key to this clip you're about to hear.  And I really thought it was real, and it wasn't.  Because, Ric Flair hit Hogan with an open hand smack.  Yeah.  And when, and Hogan went down and had his hands over his face. 
[00:55:30]  Uh-huh.  When he got back up, he was bleeding.  Yeah, but it was, it was an open, yeah, but that's that whole fucking, you know, blood  pack, fucking cut yourself with a tiny little razor blade.  That's what it is.  Whatever.  And, and I think, even on TMZ, Harvey Levin goes, well, that blood looks real.  It must have been real.  And his stabbers were going, Harvey, they, they have razor blades.  They cut themselves.  Yeah, they cut themselves.  It is real blood.  It is real blood.  Why do they always bleed from the same spot about an inch above their eyebrows? 
[00:56:00]  And all the old school wrestlers have horrible scarring on their forehead.  I saw that one.  What's his name?  McFarley?  No, um, God damn.  What was that?  One of the, uh.  The Sheik demolition.  Oh, the Bushraker.  Oh, the Bushraker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of the fucking scar marks on his forehead.  Oh, my God.  And he had just shredded.  And did Ric Flair hit him in the forehead?  No, right?  No.  It was across the face?  No, he smacked him in the cheek.  So why is he bleeding from above his eyebrows?  Because of how hard he hit him. 
[00:56:30]  Aye, nigh.  Unbelievable.  So.  Ric Flair.  Ric Flair hit Al Qaigen.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Now he's bleeding.  Aye, nigh.  All over the place.  He's bleeding.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  This is real.  It's real news.  Aye, nigh.  Ric Flair.  He hit Al Qaigen.  Aye, nigh.  Look at him.  He's bleeding all over the place like a stuck pig, aye?  There's your music. 
[00:57:00]  Here it is.  Look at the replay.  You can see he's bleeding.  He smacked him in the face, but he's bleeding from the head.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  I'm a fucking asshole.  What a wanker.  And the way the news checked their sources was they contacted Hulk Hogan's camp to find  out if it was real.  Oh, yeah.  So Hulk Hogan's camp said, oh, yes.  Yes, it was.  So they go, well, confirmed.  Yes.  In a related story, the head of the WWE, Vince McMahon, was blown up in a limousine. 
[00:57:30]  Blown up.  And then miraculously came back to life when there was a real tragedy.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, it was a bit silly.  I mean, even like once the Australian news said they thought it was real, all the goofy  wrestling fans who went to the press conference started sending to all the wrestling message  boards.  I mean, I know these are usually, it looked like it was planned to be like a fight, but 
[00:58:00]  it got out of control.  Yeah.  Come on.  It got out of control because Hulk's bleeding.  Well, you see, Ric Flair, who's been wrestling for 40 years, could not handle himself because  he was so upset with Hulk Hogan that they had to fight each other at the press conference  is what happened.  Wow.  It's smart on their part to get a little real blood going.  Now people are going to, look at the way he's bleeding. 
[00:58:30]  Like he was shot in the head.  He looks like he was shot in the head.  And I'm going to show Sam I know a little something something about wrestling.  That's the blue meanie.  No.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  Unfortunately, it looks like him.  I look like an asshole.  No, you don't.  It does look like the blue meanie, but.  Who is that then?  That's Brian Knobs of the Nasty Boys.  What?  That's him?  Yeah.  Oh, from the Nasty Boys.  The problem with the Nasty.  Does the blue meanie look like that?  He does.  He does.  But the problem with the Nasty Boys now is Brian Knobs.  I got douche chills. 
[00:59:00]  Fucked up.  Brian Knobs gained a ton of weight and his partner Jerry Sags lost a ton of weight.  Oh, no.  They don't look very brotherly.  No, they look awful.  But Brian Knobs is Hulk Hogan's best friend.  So that's why he's still working.  Look at the fucking gut on Ric Flair.  Like, is this guy?  What are they doing?  Look who's behind him.  The big Valbowski.  Val Venus.  Wow.  Val Venus?  He's going to be on the tour.  Mr. Kennedy's on the tour.  Which one's Val Venus?  He's the ball guy.  That's Val Venus? 
[00:59:30]  He was starting to thin a little bit, so he did the old shave the head.  Can I see an original picture of Val Venus?  Yeah, where's Val Venus?  I remember Val Venus.  I remember Val Venus, too.  He's falling on hard times.  Let's just say.  Oh, has he?  The steroids make your hair fall out?  I did play-by-play for Val Venus' last match in a high school gym.  Oh, look at Val Venus.  That's Val Venus?  Remember Val Venus?  We're looking at a picture of him in his heyday with the long hair.  He's got the girls.  Yeah.  And now he's bald and thin?  He's bald. 
[01:00:00]  Well, he's not super thin.  He's not in the shape he was in.  Oh, my God.  He is wrestling in Jersey City gymnasiums.  Oh, shit.  You know, this Vince McMahon.  What the fuck, dude?  Take care of your wrestlers.  Well, you know, he's a billionaire.  Easy come, easy go.  They're independent contractors, and they can do what they want with their money.  If they choose not to invest wisely, they get a gig at Jersey All-Pro Wrestling, and then  they go on the Hulkamania tour.  That's why that wrestling movie, The Wrestler, was so good, because it was so fucking real. 
[01:00:30]  That movie was dead on.  Oh, my God, right?  Yeah, because Sam lives in that world, not just in the WWE world, but he goes to those  really small wrestling shows, Ant, and he says the big stars are there, and the gym is  like fucking 50 people.  Yeah, and these are guys that were in WrestleMania and whatnot, and the locker rooms are just  like that, guys who will never make it.  Yeah, yeah.  With the all-stars, and you know, it's really unbelievable. 
[01:01:00]  Did a great job out there.  Yeah, did I?  So sad.  Yeah.  So here's the audio, the Australian TV reporter.  Nye, nye.  Reporting this Ric Flair-Hulk Hogan fight is real.  Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan has been left for bloodied as the launch of his upcoming tour  appeared to get out of hand.  After Hogan and rival Ric Flair traded insults over women, the Hulk tried to end the media  conference. 
[01:01:30]  Flair then tried to end Hogan.  This press conference is far as this thing's going right now.  Well, professional wrestling has made an art form out of hammering, hamming things up,  and hammering things as well.  This robbery looked very real. 
[01:02:00]  The reporters and photographers also forced to duck for cover as Flair ran amok, while  Hogan awaited medical attention.  Wow, they are stupid down there.  And they're all-  Because they even say, well, you know, they're known for hamming it up.  Yeah.  But that looked really real.  It looked real.  Did they hear the acting?  What are you doing, Ric?  Ric?  Hey!  Eric Bischoff trying to-  Eric Bischoff is involved too?  Yeah, control things.  What are you doing, Ric?  I just picture all these motherfuckers sitting on a goddamn 20-hour Qantas flight in coach. 
[01:02:30]  These big bruisers just sitting in coach.  Hogan up in first class and everybody else in coach.  Everyone else is in coach.  All the cronies.  Yeah, I'm the big Valbowski.  Yeah.  The big Valbowski is sitting in coach with his legs fucking, his knees in his mouth.  With the fat Brian Nobbs of the next year.  That's so fake.  And all the print articles are all reporting it as, like, real.  Oh my God, they are just dumb.  And that's making all the wrestling fans go, well, this one was for real this time. 
[01:03:00]  Jersey All-Pro Wrestling.  Who are some of the big stars now that are, oh, it says superstars.  Let's see.  All right.  Who would I know?  Well, out of all these, I don't know any of these guys.  I don't know anybody.  This Saturday night, the New Age Outlaws, Mr. Ass.  Wait, wait.  Mr. Ass is going to be there?  He'll be making his third.  Jersey All-Pro.  His third appearance? 
[01:03:30]  Yes.  Yeah!  Oh, yeah.  He can't play this, though, right?  Well, I mean, they're kind of banking on the fact that there's nobody from U.S.  So they do slip it in when he comes out?  Yeah, I mean, they won't put Mr. Ass on the flyers, but, I mean, once you get to the show.  You kind of know.  Yeah.  And then the music plays, and Mr. Ass looks around like, oh, please, God, nobody be here.  And Road Dog does the whole ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls routine that he used to do. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, my God.  I just picture them looking around like fucking, like that movie that Stephen King put out, Cat's Eye.  Yeah.  And they look around like James Woods when he had to quit smoking.  And he's smoking a cigarette.  They're just looking like, I'm playing the ass, man.  And then someone from WWE just looks at him, smiles and nods.  I got you, motherfucker.  And they're all scared of Vince.  Oh, yeah.  Are you playing the ass, man, song? 
[01:04:30]  Vince, give up a few of your bucks.  You're playing the ass, man, so I own your ass.  I own that ass.  You're not the ass, man.  And now you can kiss my ass if you think you're playing that song.  Jersey Opera.  You're hysterical.  You're fired.  I'll buy the old Jersey All Pro Wrestling and fire you. 
[01:05:00]  These poor bastards don't own anything.  Let's go to Adam in Pennsylvania.  Adam.  Hey, can I do, and that's how you executive produce an Australian accent for us.  And that's how you executive produce.  Yeah, the news is dumb down there.  Let's go to Steve and P.A.  Steve.  Nah, it's him.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  I swear.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, I'm working out here in Roselle, New Jersey, and there's flyers up in all the stores  that Jim D'Anvil Neidhart is going to be the leading wrestler at the wrestling match 
[01:05:30]  out here in the gymnasium.  Oh.  That's a big one, right?  D'Anvil is on the circuit.  He is back in the wrestling scene.  Part of the Hart Foundation, was he?  Yes, he was.  Yes, I remember that.  I went to a convention with the Hart Foundation reunion.  Yeah.  And there were, like, kids there, and they were doing a Q&A.  And it was Bret Hart, Jimmy Hart, and Jim D'Anvil Neidhart.  And Bret Hart was doing the whole thing, because as you were watching, Jim D'Anvil Neidhart was  passing out while he was sitting at the table. 
[01:06:00]  His eyes started shutting.  Then this kid raises his hand and asks Jim D'Anvil Neidhart a question.  And D'Anvil starts, like, slurring words, and he forgets the question halfway through.  And at first, the kids start laughing like he's doing a character.  Oh, no.  And then everyone went, everyone went, oh, no.  And then you just hear a low, grumbling, oh, oh, he's fucked up.  And eventually he just put his sunglasses on and you just saw his head go bopping up in town. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, it's fucking tragic.  It's rough.  It's unbelievable.  God damn, is that tragic?  Mr. Kennedy, who got fired not too long ago from D.W.E., he's on this Hulkamania tour.  But he's not Mr. Kennedy.  Of course, he can't be Mr. Kennedy.  He's Mr. Ken Anderson.  That's his real name.  That's close.  God, what is Vince doing?  He's collecting them checks.  Yeah.  Because he still can sell the Mr. Kennedy videotapes and stuff. 
[01:07:00]  The problem is Vince McMahon is a brilliant businessman.  He's a billionaire.  Yeah.  And then he's sitting across the table from these wrestlers just fucking taking advantage of them.  These wrestlers can't really get a good lawyer or agent for the most part.  You know, the top tier guy, sure.  But these other guys, no.  They're like, oh, great, yeah.  A couple hundred dollars cash, sure, I'll take that.  I'll do it.  I'm in.  Then they go through that money and now they're desperate.  And they can't get a real job because then they become stories. 
[01:07:30]  He's like, Justin Credible, the former ECW world champion, works at an olive garden in Connecticut.  And that's true.  That's not true.  It is true.  It's 100% accurate.  And he was the champion?  He was the world champion of ECW.  And now he works at Olive Garden.  Is he working at a supermarket cutting fucking cold cuts?  Here you go.  Here you go.  But that's why that movie is perfect.  Oh, bro.  That sucks.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, guys. 
[01:08:00]  Jimmy just got in from L.A.  Yay.  All right, Sam.  So Australia is taking that as a real fight when it's so obvious it was not.  Maybe I was wrong.  Maybe it was a real fight.  Is it possible he got hurt?  I heard about that.  Did he get hurt by accident?  No.  I mean.  No.  They have.  That's what I thought.  It wasn't an accident.  If you saw the video, you would understand, Jimmy.  Hulk Hogan cut himself to make it look real.  Ric Flair.  First of all, if Ric Flair is going to be mad,  he's not going to open fist slap the guy.  Yeah.  And that wouldn't be enough to knock Hogan down, by the way. 
[01:08:30]  It'll work.  And then he gets up, and now he's bleeding from the forehead.  And if he really got hurt, then there would be a major, major issue,  because he's supposed to be doing these matches with Ric Flair,  and they've invested a ton of money.  Right.  And, you know, collected all the ticket money.  Hey, good for them that they were able to get the press to believe it,  but it's so stupid that they would believe this.  And the acting was horrendous.  Oh, Rick, hey, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Rick.  Do we have the audio of the fight online?  Because someone else said they sound like the Muppet characters in the balcony. 
[01:09:00]  In the balcony.  Yeah.  Something like that, right?  That's pretty sad.  Do we have the actual fight, Danny?  That is the clip.  Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan has been left bloodied  as the launch of his upcoming tour appeared to get out of hand  after Hogan and rival Ric Flair traded insults over them.  Face to face.  They're talking.  Hulk tried to end the media conference.  Flair then tried to end Hogan.  You guys get a picture of her. 
[01:09:30]  She met me before her.  She'd be riding the space mountain of Sheridan Park Hotel.  This press conference, this one, this one's over right now.  He hit him on the side of the head, actually.  Yeah.  But he, that was not, that was not a big enough hit to knock Hulk Hogan out.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You're real there!  What are you doing, Rick? 
[01:10:00]  Who believes this?  And the look from that slap.  And the look from that slap.  Hamming things up and hammering things as well.  This frog break.  Oh, look from the slap.  From the slap.  He's bleeding in the middle of the forehead.  That's so weird.  That's the same place.  And also on the...  And also on the...  He's bleeding from when Sergeant Slaughter got him.  Same place he's bleeding from is when Sergeant Slaughter hit him.  And when Earthquake hit him.  They're believing that is a real fucking thing.  Oh, they're dummies down there.  Unbelievable, right? 
[01:10:30]  Because Ric Flair hits him on the left side of the head.  He's bleeding over the right eyebrow in the middle of the forehead.  Well, it's probably just when he fell down.  And then there's the fake holding Ric Flair back, but they're not even doing a good job.  Come on, Ric!  And Ric's making believe he's being held back harder than he is.  What do you do, Ric?  He takes his jacket off, Ric.  He had time to take his coat off like a gentleman.  And you can tell he really got hurt, because if there's one thing wrestlers do, when a  wrestler really gets hurt legitimately, he'll go over and keep attacking him.  You can see Ric Flair went and kept punching him. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So if Hulk Hogan were legitimately hurt, Ric Flair would say, now is my chance.  I'll really get him.  Yeah.  He wouldn't be like, oh, geez, we've gone too far.  Let's break this up.  We have to make money on the matches.  All it takes is to slap Hulk Hogan on the side of the face, and he'll fall down?  He will.  Well, it's Ric Flair's slap, and Ric Flair's very strong.  Yeah.  He hits you, and actually, the skin moves, so the cut appears somewhere else.  Yeah, somewhere else on the body.  That's a very powerful guy.  Yeah.  Very powerful.  Stupid media.  How old is Ric Flair now? 
[01:11:30]  Ric Flair, I believe he is approaching, if not at 60.  I would say he's got to be 60.  Is he over our prank?  No.  No.  Ric Flair is...  Ric Flair...  He shouldn't be doing any interviews with our program.  And the Ringside Fest people are extremely, still very upset, even though it was a year  ago.  Yeah.  They're very upset.  It's a year ago?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was for last year's convention.  That you and E-Rock played Opie and Anthony for the big Ric Flair interview? 
[01:12:00]  I really...  I mean, it wasn't my proudest moment.  It was a good one.  I didn't want to prank Ric Flair.  We forced you to do that.  All right.  Hogan actually fell off the stage, and that's what injured him?  Come on, guys.  If Hogan...  Look...  Hold on.  Mike, Mike, Mike, you don't believe that, do you?  Well, that's what they interviewed him on Inside Edition last night.  Oh.  He hit him...  Hogan said it.  Look.  Yeah, Hogan said it.  Actually, he hit him off the stage.  He didn't mean to fall off the stage, but that's what actually happened. 
[01:12:30]  Guys, sometimes you just got to keep it very basic.  Like, Ric Flair hit him in the side of the head, and he's bleeding from the other side  and in the middle of the floor.  It's a work.  That's the side he fell on.  Oh, that's...  He fell off the stage and cut himself.  Mike, come on.  You don't believe that, do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's wrestling.  Isn't that right, Sam?  Oh, now he's pretending that he's always...  What do you think you are, Mike?  Who do you think you are, primetime Sam Roberts?  Here's the inside.  Yeah.  If Hogan hurt himself when he fell off the stage, he would know immediately, because 
[01:13:00]  wrestlers know when they're hurt, at which point he would immediately tell Flair, I'm  hurt.  Yes.  At which point, Flair would see many dollar symbols fading away in his head, and he would  leave him alone.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ric Flair doesn't have a nest egg where he could just beat the shit out of Hogan.  Oh, look, I don't care if this never happens.  He needs to make that.  He lives in Australia for a reason.  They need money.  He's baroque.  He had, unarguably, the greatest retirement in wrestling history, and he's coming back  to do a tour of Australia against Hulk Hogan. 
[01:13:30]  He needs the money.  Mick Foley came in here when he retired.  He goes, I am so done.  He's won the championship, I think, three times since then.  Yes.  He's been TNA world champion and legends champion.  I like this announcing, I'm done with the ring thing.  Now he's what?  They're champions.  He's fought cage matches.  He's fought Kurt Angle's sting.  I blame Vince.  Mick Foley made you a lot of money, Vince.  Mick Foley should not have to be wrestling anymore.  I believe Vince would tell you that. 
[01:14:00]  I don't think Mick Foley's the type of guy that would be just spending like crazy.  I think he would be responsible with his money.  I understand some of these guys aren't.  I think he just sincerely enjoys it.  I don't know.  How broke could he be?  He's got books.  He's shit.  He's doing okay.  I saw Mick Foley do the stand-up comedy thing that he was promoting, and he really struck  me as a guy who wants out of the wrestling business.  Oh, really?  He does not want people to think of him as a pro wrestler.  How was his act? 
[01:14:30]  I mean, there were a lot of wrestling stories, you know?  He was...  Did people enjoy it?  Yeah, because they were...  I mean, they were all wrestling fans, so people did enjoy it.  Foley's a funny guy.  He is a funny guy.  But stand-up's different, obviously.  Would non-wrestling fans have enjoyed it?  I mean, they might not have gotten everything.  They might not have enjoyed it as much as wrestling fans would.  But maybe he's developing.  Like, you fast-forward six months, he's, like, at a comedy club somewhere, and, like,  you know, just with regular people.  You know, and that's when the mercenary hat-wearer came over.  And they're like, what?  Oh. 
[01:15:00]  Who's that?  I don't think Al Snow jokes would go over on a comedy crowd.  Al Snow.  Al Snow used to do our show.  I liked Al Snow.  He was the best.  I found a picture of me and it with Al Snow.  Who did he come in with?  Taz.  Probably Taz and Al Snow.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, Taz and Al Snow did the franchise O&A.  Last time I saw Taz, I was leaving, and he walked up to my window.  He's like, what's going on?  I'm like, ah, just leaving the show, you know? 
[01:15:30]  I'm going to stop up again.  He goes, yeah, I'm trying to get a show on there.  Taz is another guy.  He's trying to get a show on that show.  Just does not want to fucking deal with wrestling anymore.  Taz does not want to be a pro wrestler.  Taz does a good radio show.  He really does.  Yeah.  The problem is the business is so fucked up.  You can't make money at it right now.  Yeah.  But he does a really good show.  He did a little action at K-Rock.  Because they're pushed as sports entertainers, and when they get to a point, they want to be entertainers. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  But the entertainment world, unfortunately, does not take wrestlers.  Well, me and Opie were just talking about...  You have to say this on the air.  We were just talking about The Rock.  Well, The Rock isn't...  Who isn't even called The Rock anymore.  No.  They used to say Dwayne The Rock Johnson.  Now, it's just Dwayne Johnson, and he's in a voice in an animated movie.  Now, this guy's pulling in like 15 mil a picture.  Hold on in.  I think that he went by The Rock at first, but I think Vince McMahon owned that name. 
[01:16:30]  So, I think he...  I would bet that Dwayne was paying Vince a little money so he could promote himself as The Rock.  As The Rock.  And then, all of a sudden, he's like, I don't need to say The Rock anymore.  Money well spent, though, at first.  Right.  That's my guess.  For the first...  Because Vince owns all their names.  Yes.  Yes.  For the first handful...  He refuses to hire you unless he owns your name.  Yeah.  For the first handful of movies that The Rock was in, Vince McMahon was credited as an executive producer.  All right.  So, he got a piece of the action.  That deal's officially over. 
[01:17:00]  So, now he's Dwayne Johnson because he probably can't use The Rock, but it doesn't matter anymore  because he's being known...  He's now known in the movie world as Dwayne Johnson.  Yeah, he doesn't want to use The Rock in the movies.  He's Dwayne, fuck you, Vince Johnson now.  That's what he's calling himself.  You know, we can have a little theme on the show today because I know what you're about  to say.  Oh, what?  The Rock is one of the biggest douche chill moments on the Opie and Anthony show.  Not for the famous incident with the racism and the racist shit.  Yeah.  But when we had our problems with The Rock, we made up with him, but he stopped calling  our show, I don't know, five movies ago. 
[01:17:30]  He's doing kids' movies.  Yeah.  Big money.  In the middle of us going at it with The Rock, I said that, well, I said, I would love  to hear this.  This goes back about 10 years.  I actually said to The Rock, Jimmy, beat it or something like that, I said, me and Ant  will have a much bigger and better career than you ever will.  Yeah.  No, you didn't.  You know The Rock?  The guy that's in like every movie?  That's coming out.  Making just tons of money and that's the type of thing someone says to his parents when 
[01:18:00]  he's running away from home.  Now, why couldn't we have said that to Val Venus?  Yeah.  Then it would have been accurate.  I'll have a bigger house and I'll make more money.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was in the heat of a big...  Did Rupert Pumpkin do that?  I'll be more popular.  All right, Jerry.  I see now.  I thank you.  You're inspiring me and I'll have a bigger house.  And be twice as famous as you. 
[01:18:30]  Good.  Then you'll have twice the nut jobs chasing you around.  Oh, yeah.  You give him a Rupert Pumpkin fucking...  Do we have that?  I would love it.  I still don't believe you actually said it.  I think you're joking.  I'm paraphrasing, but that was pretty much it.  In the heat of the battle.  I'm like, well, yeah.  Well, me and Ant are going to have a much bigger and better career than you ever will.  Bigger career than you.  Yeah.  10 years later, we're still fucking doing this.  Whoopsie.  And he's in fucking...  The voice in an animated movie, which, by the way, is just fucking money in the bank 
[01:19:00]  right there.  I don't think they pay much for those.  Oh, no.  Carl in Boston.  Carl.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, Carl.  Hey.  I just wanted to remind you to play that New Moon piece with the douche publicist for  Little Yimmy.  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  Wait till you hear.  Yes.  We got some audio for Jimmy after the break.  Infuriating.  And you know what?  From this show?  No.  It's from another show.  Punch it out, boys.  It's publicist.  Publicist janking somebody off Ryan Seacrest's show for asking the wrong question. 
[01:19:30]  How bad of a question go Ryan Seacrest ask?  Stop it.  Ant, someone tweeted me, and there might be another little angle on that whole thing.  Oh, yeah?  I'll explain after the break, yeah.  Oh, look at you.  And there's something else we want to play for Jimmy today.  You don't know about the fugitive.  Spend the bottle?  Do you know about the fugitive?  Were you here for the fugitive?  No.  No, because he left.  Oh, my God.  Oh, by the way, Levy left me a voicemail.  Thank you, everybody.  He loved being here.  He had a fucking great time, so I guess you guys hung with him after, right?  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  We had a great time with Levy.  Good.  He did the last hour with us when you went to the airport to go to L.A.  We did the fugitive audio with Levy, and we gave him more promotion for his radio show  than Howard Stern has in six months.  It's a fact.  And he really appreciated that.  Good.  That was good.  That's all.  Good.  We like helping others out.  Levy's a great dude.  On the Rob Schneider audio.  Is that worth replaying?  That means we're just going to redo yesterday's show.  Well, no.  I think we're just going to redo yesterday's show, and Jimmy can chime in.  Jimmy, we had a hell of a show yesterday.  You wanted to play the Seacrest for Jimmy. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, that we've got to play, because Jimmy hates when the publicists stick their nose  into them.  I have very little respect for publishers.  All right.  We'll play that next.  We'll figure it out.  Jimmy's here.  Yay.  And that's good news.  Ding, no, it's back.  Patrice O'Neill's going to be here in about a half hour.  And, oh, you don't know Ken Jeong is coming by now.  Yeah, no, I was up on the emails.  That's good.  How cool is he?  We met him that day.  Very cool.  You're going to love him, man.  Who?  Ken Jeong.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're going to love him.  Oh, my God.  Well, speaking of Asians, I've been watching... 
[01:21:00]  Is this a tease?  No, no, I've been watching that where I just got...  It's a quick comment.  Yeah.  I've been watching World War II in HD.  It's color movies taken during World War II of the European theater and the Pacific theater.  I don't like when they call it theater.  I despise when they call it theater.  Theater of operations.  Theater is supposed to be, you know, a good time.  Fun.  All right.  It's a good time for the people that made it.  I understand. 
[01:21:30]  This special broadcast, it's like five days, I guess.  For me, it's narrated by Gary Sinise.  It's now called Let's Just Watch Dead Japanese People with Flies on Them.  I have never seen so many dead Japanese people ever.  And it's color, so it's disturbing.  Like black and white, I was saying this yesterday, it kind of sets you apart from the action. 
[01:22:00]  Look at the poor little Japanese kid shaking.  Jesus.  And when you see it in color, doesn't that like, it's more like it's real.  Like that shit gives you more a sense of, oh my God, this shit happened than when you watch it in black and white.  And that's not colorized, right?  No, this is real color movies from World War II.  They were showing where they had dropped a fuckload of bombs on a shitload of Japanese that were coming after, I guess, 800 U.S. soldiers.  It was something like 3,000 Japanese coming after 800 U.S. soldiers. 
[01:22:30]  Wow.  I think it was on either Guadalcanal or Iwo Jima.  And they bombed the shit out of these Japanese to the point that they had to retreat.  And the dead that were left on top of this mountain, unbelievable.  They showed them.  Burnt.  Just burnt and contorted like all with their mouths open and flies like buzzing in and out.  And the narrated guy is just going, I remember the smell of death and burning flesh. 
[01:23:00]  And you just see like naked, dead people.  And it's so fucking sick, this thing.  It's great.  Can I tell you why I love Anthony?  Because you said we have Ken Jeong coming in.  And he goes, oh, dead Asians.  Dead Asians.  I've never seen so many dead Asians in one war.  That reminded you.  How do you not love Anthony?  Hey, we got Patrice coming in.  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:30]  1452.  We went over there.  We just took them.  You really are the worst.  It reminded me.  It's never a happy association.  You know, I saw this Japanese girl.  She was low.  It's never.  It always reminds me of some dead ethnic cleansing.  Horrific.  2,000 burnt to a crisp Japanese.  I'm glad I didn't mention my Jewish friend that was stopping in.  And then they, oh, my God.  The Japanese soldiers told the civilians that the Americans were brutal. 
[01:24:00]  If they caught you, you were going to be raped and tortured and murdered.  So, I believe in Saipan, they were being overrun.  And the civilians went to a cliff and were just jumping off onto the rocks below, throwing their children off, slitting their children's throats, and jumping with them.  What?  And just leaving piles of dead people.  They have footage of this?  Oh, hells yeah.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I can see that.  At the bottom of this big ravine.  Because they were afraid of being killed.  They were afraid of being captured. 
[01:24:30]  So, then they got this Japanese guy that they captured to get on a loudspeaker and go, look, I'm being fed, I'm being clothed, and they're taking care of us.  Don't do this.  And they just still showed a film of people just jumping off of these cliffs.  Like, fuck you.  But you're right.  It does look more real when you see it in color.  When you see it in white, it's weird.  World War II has always been like a black and white thing for us.  We just watch it, and it's like, all right, that's kind of interesting, but it sets you further apart.  You don't get that real it happened thing.  It's almost like you're watching a movie, or it's too old to be like, to mean anything. 
[01:25:00]  You know?  And watching it in color, and watching their faces in color, and the equipment, and just...  Not just color, it's high def.  I mean, the quality's amazing as we look at this on YouTube.  What do they call it?  You know, when they fix the film?  That's it.  They fix the film.  They fix the film.  Digitally remastered.  Remastered.  It's like when you watch The Honeymooners, right?  It's like people who would go to see that show taped would see these black and white characters in color. 
[01:25:30]  It must have been so weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Because everyone watched everything in black and white.  And then you go there, and you see, oh, it's a blue.  Oh, that's red.  That must have been so fucking creepy.  That would be cool.  I would have killed myself.  Yes.  I would have loved to have gone to a Honeymooners tape.  Are you kidding me?  And a bit of black and white movie trivia from Alfred Hitchcock and the movie Psycho.  The blood going down the drain, actually Hershey's syrup.  Because blood just didn't look good. 
[01:26:00]  Like red didn't look good on black and white.  As good as brown looked like.  I guess it just didn't look good.  Looked gray?  It probably looked like, yeah.  It didn't look like blood.  It's only two answers.  Black or gray.  So they used Hershey's syrup.  Oh, that's pretty interesting.  Look at that shit, man.  A guy in a Hellcat.  This is fucking great footage, man.  Dude, it's such a great documentary.  How many hours is this?  It's an hour a day for, I think it's a five-day thing.  And they have stories from, I think, a dozen or so soldiers, is it? 
[01:26:30]  There's a lot of people.  And they're narrated by celebrities and stuff.  But they go through their experiences.  And some of them they show them how they are now.  And others you don't know.  And it's like that letter got sent to the parents along with the telegram of his death.  And then the telegram, like you always get the telegram that says, oh, he was a hero and everything.  Some of these guys got telegrams that just said, your son gave his life for the war effort. 
[01:27:00]  No trace.  They didn't know where or how he died or anything like that.  It sucks.  It's just, that's it.  He's dead.  Just make them all heroes.  Well, that's pretty much what they, you know, are.  Well, I guess that's not fair either, right?  Well, they kind of are.  I don't know what the right thing is.  Oh, yeah.  Just write like, you know, hey, he saved like 10 people.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's something.  Yeah.  Patrice walking down the hall.  Jimmy's here.  Why don't we take a break?  And I got to thank you, Rock, before we do.  Oh, my God.  For burning me a CD when I had asked for a DVD.  Thanks.  Oh, no.  So I handed it in to Leno's people so they could watch material for my next uninvited guest. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, no.  And I had to listen to it like it's fucking 1985.  Oh, shit.  What a dunce.  Let's get you, Rock, in here so you can beat him up a little bit.  Stay there, Opie and Anthony.  Burn dinner.  And Jim Norton and Patrice O'Neill.  All right.  We're back.  Patrice O'Neill in the studio playing the Stress Factory.  Oh, tonight.  Wow.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Vinny's Club in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the Stress Factory. 
[01:28:00]  Go see Patrice O'Neill.  Jimmy's back from L.A.  We're talking about Thanksgiving.  We're talking about vegetables we hate.  We're talking about the shock collar that Patrice brought in.  I don't know where to go.  Where do you want to start?  I want to hear the publicist audio.  Okay, we got that.  I want to hear that just to wrap that up because I heard about it.  I haven't heard it.  You want to start with that?  All right, let's do this.  Is it interesting?  Yeah, because it's something we can relate to.  When you're having a good interview and the dumb publicist that's sitting outside the studio 
[01:28:30]  doesn't crack a smile.  She's just looking at her fucking watch.  She's got a big, huge handbag, whatever the hell they're called.  The business has to...  She's got her coat on.  She doesn't even want to take her coat off.  The business asks for that because they don't hit back at publicists.  Like a guy like Owen Wilson, I'm using him as a completely random example.  Any celebrity.  The bottom line is if the publicist is behaving like a twat, what you have to do is every  show has to go, we're not helping Owen Wilson promote this movie until he dumps her.  The bottom line is they need to promote more than the talk shows need them on because there's 
[01:29:00]  enough fucking famous people to do talk shows.  And then eventually these shitty, cunty publicists will smarten up and stop it.  There's no reason the business needs to be slaved to these fucking wannabes.  And some of them are great.  Some of them protect their people.  They keep you from making an asshole out of yourself.  I mean, they do serve a purpose, but they overextend all the time.  Because a lot of actors are fucking boars and they're dummies.  And so they're protected by somebody who's a little smart.  I don't know what purpose they serve when their people are going on talk shows. 
[01:29:30]  I really don't.  Because, you know, it's all about promotion and being able to handle yourself.  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  The business has to hit back.  Yeah, of course they do.  Of course they do.  We say no to a lot of pretty famous people because we know they're going to be just boars  on the air because they're in that world where you know you can't ask them much of anything.  Don't ask them about this, this, this.  And it's all the shit that, since we're having them on anyway, wouldn't you want to ask them that?  That's also the fault of the fucking pansy pussy artist.  I've had enough of these fucking artists and what they don't want to talk about. 
[01:30:00]  That's why I like comics.  We fucking talk about everything.  I bet it's the publicist more so than the artist.  They tell them, look, don't talk about that because it'll fuck this up or that.  Sometimes, but I think a lot of times the artist gets off the hook, too, because they hide behind the publicist, too.  A lot of fucking actors and musicians hide behind the publicist, too.  Yeah.  Robert Pattinson.  Who's that?  And you're not supposed to know who Robert Pattinson is, so that's very good that you just said that.  Okay, good.  And Kristen Stewart, they're the stars of that Twilight movie. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, okay.  Did you see the first Twilight, Patrice?  It was a phenomenon from what I understand, but I...  And you watch all movies.  Patrice watches more movies than anyone I know.  It just looked like something from CW.  But you've seen the Harry Potter movies, right?  No.  Whoa.  That blows up my argument.  Harry Potter movies aren't bad.  I've never seen them either.  They're not bad.  You know how there's some movies you're just anti?  Right, I understand that.  Like, I'm not going to see Precious, ever.  Why? 
[01:31:00]  That's...  Come on, he's expressing his opinion.  No, unless...  What did I do to you, man?  You're a good asshole?  It's the holidays.  I want to get a version of Precious in the theaters with a laugh track.  Just a big, over-the-top laugh track.  That movie looks brutal.  About the face with a frying pan.  Ronnie B said it's a...  What did he say?  I don't want to wreck the line.  It's a...  Oh, fuck. 
[01:31:30]  Help me out, Ant.  Isn't it the Black Rudy?  No, no.  Black something.  Exactly.  I've never seen Rudy.  What did he say?  A bigger...  Overrated.  A bigger, blacker Juno?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What was his line about that?  I think that was it.  Nah, it was better than that.  If it's not that, but it's funny.  A bigger, blacker Juno.  A fatter, blacker Juno.  A fatter, blacker Juno.  I've never seen Juno.  Like, it's just something...  You know how some movies you're just not going to go see?  Is Juno good?  I heard it's great.  It's just the hood of the pants.  It's like...  Traveling pants.  Like the TV goes off.  An American quilt.  I saw Juno.  How'd it make an American quilt? 
[01:32:00]  You're on the Oscar for it.  I like Juno.  Lorenzo's oil.  Like, anything...  Lorenzo's oil.  Anything, really?  Your special oil for your kid?  Is this a real story?  It is.  I'm not ever going to see that.  As soon as I see suffering for the whole movie, it's just like...  I don't mind that.  Powder?  Bye.  What is Lorenzo's oil?  I don't mind suffering unless it's cheesy suffering.  Lorenzo's oil is this kid has some shitty disease, and only...  Is that what it's about?  I think only olive oil worked on his muscles or something.  Isn't that the one where the parents, like, found a cure or something? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, oil.  Like, uh...  Vegetable oil or something for the kid.  Is it sensitive, Nick Nolte, or the Nick Nolte I like from Q&A?  I love my son.  Oh, yuck.  I love my son.  Jimmy, you gotta go see Precious.  I'll see that.  The trailer is...  I like a miserable movie.  I like a depressing crime movie.  Well, then you're gonna love Precious.  Nah.  But if it misses, it misses badly.  Precious 2.  With Monique.  Newark Airport.  With Monique.  She works at Newark Airport.  You gotta...  Can you please take all your things out the bag and your shoes off, please? 
[01:33:00]  Get your laptops out.  Can you please?  Monique looks brutal in that movie.  Doesn't she hit Precious with fucking a frying pan or something?  Yeah.  Throws her down the stairs?  It's supposed to be...  They're pushing it, and Oprah supposedly has no money involved, but she's pushing it like  she does.  Like, she put a name on it just so people see it.  Yeah.  I just...  It's a movie...  I think Oprah said it's a movie that must be seen.  Like, why?  Right.  Exactly.  Fucking why?  So it's Clockwork Orange, fat lady.  Shut up.  In any movie that I see when there's a bunch of black chicks doing, like, dancing in a living 
[01:33:30]  room with some wine...  Do they have scenes like that?  I saw a scene like that, yeah.  Well, that's just...  That's like...  What's the pizza movie?  Like, Mystic Pizza or...  So it's Stella, get her groove back or some shit.  Fried green tomatoes, anything.  Yeah.  Where it's just a bunch of horse shit.  Do you know, I keep Anthony in a room full of black women drinking wine.  Literally, there's not one thing you could say that they wouldn't hate you for.  Unless it was I'm leaving.  That's true.  I'm leaving. 
[01:34:00]  They would end up loving...  And Anthony, this is what...  Black women have a beautiful way.  They would just tickle ant until you like black people.  Yeah.  They would just kiss you on the cheek.  Is that what that'd be?  And they'll call you baby until you start crying.  They're like, what's wrong, baby?  Well, I don't like when...  I don't like black strippers.  Like, when they come up to me and want to lap dance, you know, give me lap dance and  shit like that.  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  I know.  But I don't like white strippers.  I don't know.  I don't mind.  What's wrong with you?  I think white strippers are corn balls.  I don't like the black strippers.  That's true.  That's true.  That's true.  That's true.  That's true.  That's true.  You know.  They're too good at dancers. 
[01:34:30]  I don't like anybody.  That's what bothers me about black strippers.  There's not enough desperation.  It's like, this fucking chick is really good at what she does.  It annoys me.  I like a girl who shakes like her stiff hips because you know she's got a kid at home.  She needs money.  White strippers are just cunts.  Like, they just like...  They treat you like you're there paying to see their pussy.  And I go, yeah, I am.  I like Jimmy's point, though.  You want them to look like they're doing it for the drugs.  A little desperate.  A little rent.  I've never seen a white stripper that looks desperate, though.  Like, that looks like she's... 
[01:35:00]  Really?  Yeah, there's a bunch of Russian broads and Ukrainian chicks.  That doesn't look like your white strippers now.  And they hate men.  You rarely get...  Yeah.  They're kidnapped.  Great.  I was...  He came from Ukraine.  Just like...  Never thought I'd do the dance.  But I have to make the money.  No.  And you're like, shut up and fucking shake your ass.  Patrice has got to go down in the minor leagues.  You're going to the nice places.  Go to the minor leagues.  Well, if I go to the minor leagues, I go to see black people and Latinos.  The minor leagues strip clubs is where you're going to see some good stuff.  Yeah, but I don't...  You're going to see the gunshot wounds and the cesarean scars. 
[01:35:30]  I don't want to see, Paul.  I went to an illegal one in Manhattan.  It was on top of a Dunkin' Donuts.  Really?  And the girls...  Was it Uptown?  It was around 40-something.  That's not Uptown.  I would fill up just thinking about that place.  And she...  It was just...  It just smelled like...  You know, it had a dirty mop smell.  Yeah.  And it just was horrible.  And the girl stuck her whole hand in her asshole.  Oh, nice.  Is it still open?  I don't know.  How'd you get in?  My bachelor party.  How'd you get in there?  You know.  Where do you get married? 
[01:36:00]  The code word is crullers.  Jimmy said bachelor party.  You thinking about getting married, Jim?  No, I was just kidding.  I couldn't think of a worse place to go before you fucking tell someone you love them forever.  It's a club over at Dunkin' Donuts where a girl has a fist in her asshole.  Go to church the next day.  But it's illegal?  How do you find out about it?  Well, you need a...  I think you need a license to just do certain things.  I think one is that women in a room sticking hands in their ass and...  You can't do that. 
[01:36:30]  And selling liquor.  Yeah.  Where you're not supposed to be selling liquor.  Probably a health code violation.  Oh, it's just awful.  Having her hand up her ass and then maybe, you know, touching you.  Sticky floors.  But that shit is just...  The rules are dumb.  Just because a girl can shove her fist up her ass and you can't sell liquor?  What's that about?  Well, you know, you can't touch them.  Some places you can't touch them if they serve liquor.  Can you touch that place?  In that place?  Oh, you could...  I could have joined it.  You could have just stick it in.  Yeah.  I put a little Congo butter on my hand.  As long as you're buying some donuts when you leave. 
[01:37:00]  That's the only obligation.  You gotta buy a fucking dozen donuts.  Dozen stale donuts.  On the way out.  All right.  Listen.  So we got the Twilight movie.  All right.  So it's the guy and the girl who are in the movie.  Well, just a little back story.  The whole entertainment world.  That fake phony fucking Hollywood fucking thing.  They're all trying to figure out if these two are dating.  And they're kind of fooling around with the rumor.  They probably are dating, but they don't want the public or their fans to know, because 
[01:37:30]  I guess that would be bad, because everybody that goes to see this movie wants to bang  either the chick or the guy.  You know what I mean?  It's kind of like a Beatles thing.  You know, the Beatles weren't supposed to...  And this is big time, right?  You want to act like you're single.  You want to act like you're single and available, even though all the Beatles had fucking girlfriends  and kids and pregnant women at home.  It was a mess for the Beatles.  That's the fans.  It's the number one bestseller of all those books.  Twilight.  Oh, it's a book thing.  Oh, okay.  And they became a movie.  They're massive teenage books.  Somebody on Twitter told me, fuck Dexter. 
[01:38:00]  Go read the Dexter books.  I heard.  Yeah, I heard that.  Is that crazy?  That's crazy to read a book when you just watch the show.  I like reading a book before I see the movie.  No, because then you lose.  I know.  You go the other way.  You see the movie and then read the book.  Then you learn more.  I hate people that fucking read the book.  I see the movie.  Why?  I hate people that read Joel's.  I did read Joel's.  Did you know that in the book, fucking Hooper dies and he fucks Brody's wife in the book?  In the book, yeah.  But you read the book after.  And the shark just dies. 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  From having so much shit done to it during that course of the hunt and everything.  Yes.  There's no big blow up scene.  There's no big.  He just fucking.  He just floats belly up like a regular fish.  He just goes, you know, I had enough.  You got me.  Peter Benchley's an idiot.  You got me.  Peter Benchley's an idiot.  In the book, the shark actually electrocutes himself plugging in a fax machine.  It was really a weird ending.  He did invent the fax machine.  Instead of remaking these great movies like Jaws, I'm sure they'll remake Jaws eventually.  Why not just remake Jaws, but follow the book pretty much. 
[01:39:00]  They did that with The Shining.  They did.  And it stunk on ice.  Oh, so that wrecked it for everybody?  I didn't know that.  And I heard The Road.  That movie, The Road, a friend of mine said.  I read The Road.  It's the worst.  It's like the most.  It's the worst book they've ever seen.  Like, not worse in sucks, but worse.  Like, it's depressing.  It's the most depressing.  I read The Road.  The Road.  The Road.  It's an apocalyptic fucking aftermath.  But I hear it's just a horrible experience.  Just walking on the road trying to figure out how, you know, what is what.  There's no punctuation.  There's no character names. 
[01:39:30]  There's just...  It's...  It's...  I read the book because it was on so many lists as one of the best books of the last  ten years.  And I read it.  I was like...  It was all right.  I read it in like two or three days.  That kind of sounds cool, though.  I like that post-apocalyptic shit.  Yeah.  I think it could be a good movie.  Well, it is a movie.  It's coming out.  Yeah, I know.  I think the movie's going to do well.  Vigo.  I think the book is...  Vigo's in it.  Vigo.  Yeah.  Vigo.  And the dude from The Wire.  Is it...  Fucking...  Michael Williams?  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, cool.  I think he's in that.  Who?  Michael K. Williams.  Omar.  Omar.  Oh, Omar's in it.  What up, bird?  Yo, what up, bird?  It's the best fucking line  in the entire series.  Oh, gay gangsta.  Oh, my.  Yeah, he says hello  to the guy in court  as he's lying  to get thrown in jail  for the rest of his life.  Because he was lying.  The guy didn't commit that murder.  What up, bird?  Yo, what up, bird?  Bird was not happy.  We were tweeting  our favorite lines  from The Wire  for a couple days later.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah, it was all right.  Do you watch your Wire watching?  What happened?  Do you watch The Wire?  Fuck, man. 
[01:40:30]  Because of Jimmy.  Every episode.  The best character is Snoop  without challenge.  The best being gangster.  She's the best fucking...  Omar, by far.  I agree.  Snoop is right there.  In the first...  Omar just rules.  And then Snoop is a close...  I would say a close second.  The most complete character  was fucking Avon Barksdale,  I think.  Because that...  He's only in one.  No, no, no.  He's in the first three.  Yeah, he made it a...  He's a great fucking actor,  but he had a really weird,  slow delivery.  Like, he was a fucking  really underrated, man. 
[01:41:00]  How'd that guy  never won an Emmy  for that fucking...  He watched season one.  I watched season one  and it fell off.  It was great, though.  You didn't like it?  I know, I liked it.  The second season  is a little rough.  Season two  messed you up a little bit.  It had nothing to do  with me not liking it.  I loved it.  I thought it was great,  but I don't know why  I just never took  that next season  and started popping it in.  Just start over season...  I'm telling you,  just start over season two.  You're only a couple episodes in.  Yeah.  You get caught up in the docks.  There's so much more  with the fucking drug dealers.  There's so much more 
[01:41:30]  with Barksdale  and fucking D'Angelo.  There's so much more.  And then I'm telling you,  season fucking two grabs you.  Now it's like...  And Ziggy was in it.  We just start season two.  You'll remember everybody.  You know what, though?  Now it's all about  Call of Duty.  Not Call of Duty.  People had to wait a year  to watch these shows anyway.  There was always a year  they had to come out.  What about Bubbles?  Oh, Bubbles.  Of course.  He was also Andre fucking Royal.  He might be the best actor.  Or is his name Michael  now on 90210.  Who?  The guy who played  fucking Tristan? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Good for him.  He's not one 90210.  And the cop who made  drugs legal  was one of my favorites.  Bunny.  Bunny.  Oh, right, right.  Bunny rules.  It's a good show.  Yeah, man.  I'm going to watch it again.  It's about time.  Well...  Oh, that thing.  We've got so much going on.  We'll get...  We'll get...  Get the audio.  And look at her feet.  Hey.  The guy's married to a basketball.  I was going to say  he married to beach ball. 
[01:42:30]  He married to beach ball  with arms.  I know.  Just arms, not legs.  I know.  And they go with  Victoria's Secret model.  It's that edition show.  Oh, are they vultures?  They should be blown up.  They should have a show  where you just film people, right?  Like a hidden camera film  where you film people  watching something  before they are told  what to think about it.  Right, right.  So they just show that thing  just sitting there pregnant  and just have people watch...  Their first reaction is 
[01:43:00]  oof.  Until they watch fucking CW  and somebody goes,  oh my God.  Even things can fuck.  That's fucking...  Even things can fuck.  That God damn...  That is just disturbing.  Yeah.  Like what the fuck  was he thinking  as he's fucking that?  He eats it too.  You know he puts it  on his face and eats it.  Ah, stop.  You a motherfucker, man.  She's got them little feet  that we're poking out  like wah.  You know what she should come with?  She should come with a... 
[01:43:30]  With a...  Oh, what the fuck?  A tall wife too?  Wait a minute.  What's the fucking movie  where the guy  was on the shoulders?  Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome?  The thing that was sitting on...  Masterplast.  Masterplast.  She should go around  like Masterplaster.  The big retard  had the fucking  little midget guy.  Oh, Quato.  Quato.  He should just superglue her  to suicide.  Just...  And feed it. 
[01:44:00]  Are you fucking serious?  They're gonna make me watch her?  Yeah, yeah.  She's pregnant  and she's gonna be  having a kid.  She had a kid already, right?  I guess so.  She's got a couple kids.  The guys will get  the audio down the hall.  It's Twitter.  Yeah.  Can we have one  thing on TV  where someone goes,  ugh?  Yeah, because that's  why it's on TV  for us to go, ugh.  But they try to make it  like it's a real thing  that you really need  to know about  and learn about.  No, you want to look  and stare and laugh.  Steve from Bajor says 
[01:44:30]  she should have been  birthed into a tiny  little casket.  Jesus.  The doctor's just going  push to the mother,  push.  Slam the leg shut.  Poor little feller.  What are you doing  saving every photograph  you take for the next  20 years?  Trust me.  You're gonna thank me.  Steve.  Just what the fuck, man?  I don't know.  We got to get the audio.  You know what?  We got to show these guys  the risky business video. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  Is that fucking hysterical?  All right, don't say anything.  I love it.  When Danny comes back  in studio, we got a video  for you.  Let's get the Twilight  thing out of the way.  So we're talking about  movies, Twilight,  the two stars,  are they dating,  are they not?  Everyone needs to know  and that's what  Ryan Seacrest decided  he was gonna ask.  Ryan Seacrest also  is the demo of these  people that are  interested in this.  Sure.  So him asking a question  about a relationship  is, I mean,  that's what all these  fucking little tweens  and shit want to know  about.  Who is he going out 
[01:45:30]  with?  What's his...  So we asked the question  that his audience  wants to know  and this happens.  And he's not a button  pushing.  I was a little bit  more nervous about  this one than any  of the others  because it's kind  of the finale  of the press tour  and everything  and you kind of,  you have to sort of  please everybody.  What do you say  to your fans  who are desperate  to know about you  and your co-star,  Kristen?  What can you tell them?  What can you tell  them about it?  I can tell them  to watch the movie.  You can't ask that question?  You can't ask 
[01:46:00]  that question to the guy?  It's his co-star.  It's a fair question.  Thank you very much.  I was just cut off  for the first time ever.  The thing I can say  to them is  watch New Moon.  It's amazing.  Hey, thank you.  Did you hear her?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's go.  Let's go.  She sucks.  But so does  that fucking fruity star.  If you're a fucking...  If you're talent  and you let that  fucking bitch  pull you off  a show of that side...  Excuse me.  No.  Yeah.  I would never  have let my fucking  publicist pull me out. 
[01:46:30]  Hold on.  And you say,  I'd rather just not  talk about my personal  life.  I'm here for that.  But you know,  I understand you want  to know.  Nope.  There's ways to do it  diplomatically where  the publicist doesn't  have to be a cunt  and you don't have to  come off looking  like an asshole.  I don't think  you did though.  I think that kid...  First of all,  you know,  you're a man  and I never had  a publicist.  You know what I mean?  I think I had one  for a month  and I said,  this is not me.  Yeah,  leave.  You know,  to go somewhere  and just take a picture  because you're there 
[01:47:00]  and it's just pathetic.  But if you're 20 years old  and this is...  You're a part of a machine  and that's what you are  and your publicist,  let's go.  I don't know  if he's old enough,  you know what I mean?  To go...  Maybe not.  Get out of here,  bitch.  Get out of here.  Like sometimes  your management...  It took years  for me to realize  that sometimes  management agents,  they make you feel  like you work for them.  Yeah, yeah.  Like they tell you things  and they say things to you  and you go,  wait a minute,  motherfucker.  Yeah, wait,  you're working for me. 
[01:47:30]  You don't write my checks.  I'm paying you.  Yeah, I pay you.  Don't have checks  go to your office  and you pay me, bitch.  I owe you money.  I owe my agent money  as I should.  Not he owes me money,  motherfucker.  So the thing is,  this kid seemed like  he wasn't to be fair to him.  He didn't seem like  he was a dick.  He seemed like  he was going,  fucking Ryan,  I'm sorry.  And Ryan's like  kind of like  not a,  he's a Hollywood dude  so he didn't even trip out. 
[01:48:00]  She was being a cunt  but if that happened here,  he needed to be  on a show like this  because that would have,  that we,  this show would have  forced him to  go,  dude,  wait,  wait,  whoa,  like for real,  are you upset about this?  No, let's count.  You would have cursed her out.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Because he's a young guy.  That's what I'm saying.  He's a young guy.  Yeah.  Nope.  Just listen in the background  because if you miss it,  you really got to listen  in the background  and it's hard  because of the conversation  going on in the foreground  but just listen, 
[01:48:30]  listen to her.  Just listen to the publicist  in the background.  Just listen to that  fucking voice  that we've heard  a thousand times.  That's why I was  a little bit more nervous  about this one  than any of the others  because it's kind of  the finale  of the press tour  and everything  and you kind of,  you have to sort of  please everybody.  What do you say  to your fans  who are desperate  to know  about you  and your co-star Kristen?  What can you tell them?  What can you tell them  about it?  I can tell them  to watch New Moon  because it's our  fantastic movie.  You can't ask that question  to the guy? 
[01:49:00]  It's his co-star.  It's a fair question.  Thank you very much.  I was just cut off  for the first time ever.  The thing I can say  to them is  watch New Moon  is amazing.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Shut up, Brian.  That's what I said yesterday.  Fucking thank you.  You don't thank them  unless it was sarcasm.  He's one of those guys.  No, it wasn't sarcasm.  He's in that world.  He's that guy.  It wasn't sarcasm.  The second time  I did Letterman  it was  the regular producer  was there,  this woman. 
[01:49:30]  And, you know,  I'm me  but I go,  I do the show  and I'm having a good time  and when I left  she goes  and it gave me,  you know how you do things  that give you those  oh, fuck,  that deuce chills  myself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She said,  look back and wave  and smile and goodbye  and say goodbye to the audience.  And I just,  at the moment  I just go,  bye.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I should have said,  let's go eat my balls,  motherfucker.  But at the moment, dude,  it's like a split second  where you go, 
[01:50:00]  dignity,  it's just like,  oh shit,  wait,  dignity or fucking just,  bye.  It's like,  that dude was just,  let's go,  go.  And he's just like,  he already said,  I have to please people  and I'm trying to make  everyone happy.  So there's a publicist  going,  do you want to be a star  or not,  you cocksucker?  Yes, yes.  And you know,  that's,  it just,  it takes a lot  to be a fucking man.  It takes till you're  fucking 40.  The studio or whoever  is,  she should be fucking  fired.  I agree.  Because if that was 
[01:50:30]  my film and she was on,  especially a guy like  Seacrest.  Seacrest, right.  That bitch should be,  who is she?  You should find out  who she is.  Listen,  and on top of that,  that question is being  asked everywhere.  That's not an out of  the blue question.  So the publicist,  the only way she's  going to deal with that  is to yank the guy  out of the interview.  It's ridiculous.  At this point,  if you're a publicist,  you sit the guy down  and go,  look,  obviously this question  is being asked  everywhere.  We've got to figure  out a way to answer  that properly.  Here's how you divert.  Even though I wouldn't  want to hear that  they're doing that,  but at least that's  better than yanking  talent off radio shows 
[01:51:00]  and TV shows.  We're asking the  question that  everyone's asking.  That's embarrassing.  That's just  embarrassing.  Do they show the  publicist in the video,  Dan?  I don't know.  On air with Ryan  Seacrest from the  world premiere of  The Twilight Saga,  New Moon,  is brought to you  by Bing,  the decision engine.  Go to bing.com  and check out  commercials.  All right,  enough.  Commercials.  These commercials  are getting longer  and longer before  the videos,  man.  I didn't mind.  Oh,  this was in line  somewhere?  Oh,  no. 
[01:51:30]  Okay,  we can see the  video of this.  And you guys,  we'll tell you  where the video is.  The last time I  talked to you,  take a break there,  I know you're  rushing,  but you can relax  here for a second.  When I talked to you  when you were in the  studio with us,  you said this whole  acting thing,  you weren't quite sure  what you were doing.  You sort of stumble  into every role.  I think you've locked  into a rhythm now,  what'd you say?  Can you pause that?  Stumbling.  No,  no.  Just want to point out  something we've seen  a million times  that I did describe it  perfectly about 20 minutes ago.  Yeah.  You see the publicist 
[01:52:00]  standing in the corner.  Yes.  Arms pretty much folded.  Ugly, fucking ugly.  Not reacting to anything.  She's like a robot  as this guy's doing  an interview with  Ryan Seacrest.  You already see her  kind of ruining  the vibe of the room.  It's his personal life  and that fucking bitch  yanked him out?  Right.  Ah, I hate them.  Go ahead.  Figuring it out.  I hope so.  I hope so.  I do feel a little bit  more confident in everything.  Now that you see people  screaming exactly the same  way as they did last year. 
[01:52:30]  Talk about that.  I mean, I just saw you  walk up to a couple  fans here in Westwood.  What's that moment like  for you when you realize  what an impact  this character's had  on people?  Oh, God, the publicist.  You see her?  Yeah, yeah.  We've seen that look  a million fucking times.  Get that bitch  out of the studio.  Oh, shit.  I just hope I don't  sort of miss anyone.  Like, the little things  you can do.  Oh, he just doesn't  know he's gay yet.  I've waited outside  for five days.  The bar is raised  with something like  this phenomenon, isn't it?  Yeah, and you do feel  like...  Don't answer that.  And that planned  messy hair.  This whole world sucks. 
[01:53:00]  The planned messy hair.  Fucking on-purpose mess.  What's the difference  between that  and just messy hair?  What do you say  to your fans?  Because everything else  is...  Oh, wait, here it is.  We've got to all shut up.  Go back, Dan.  What can you tell me?  The ugly fucking skinny  one is...  Because Ryan goes,  what do you say  to your fans?  And she starts making  the cut.  The cut.  That's a woman  who wanted to be powerful.  That's a fucking nobody,  no talent,  who wanted to be powerful  just doing something 
[01:53:30]  powerful.  And before you turn  back on,  she's a...  Don't forget, man.  Shit rolls down  fucking hill.  If this is not her...  She's a PR person  for a company  who has...  Oh, it goes way above her.  A foot right in her pussy  for all day.  A foot in her pussy.  So if she had  any confidence,  she would be like...  But that's where  Jimmy is correct.  The show's got to  start fighting back.  You know what, though?  We've had enough  of these publicists  and they take it  upon themselves.  She's just jumping in 
[01:54:00]  because she...  Maybe that question  shouldn't have been asked  or wasn't supposed  to be asked,  but that bitch,  the way she yanked him  out of an interview  of this size,  what he should do  is go,  nobody from that  stupid movie  is getting on my radio show  and then Leno should do it  and Letterman should do it  and Conan should do it  and then that bitch  would never show  her stupid face  backstage again.  Go further.  Ryan Seacrest  this is on American Idol.  I'm sure the same publicist  has people that would love  to be on American Idol.  You've got to fight back.  We had a problem  with Brooke Hogan,  not her personally. 
[01:54:30]  We had an interview  with Brooke Hogan  and it went great  and then they were giving us  the wrap-up sign  but it was obvious  she was having a good time  and there was a couple  things going on  that we couldn't really wrap up  so we went long  with the interview.  Because we went long  with that interview,  Brooke Hogan had not  a problem with us.  That publicist  is giving us hell  behind the scenes.  Hell.  What could have happened?  Hell.  And then we couldn't  get Hulk in  was that the company  could have said  well if you're going  to hold that against him  and not give him Hulk  then Hulk's not doing  anything on the serious platform.  So they would not  of course not do that. 
[01:55:00]  Why would they?  I mean Stern  they can't control  but any other show  on the platform  they could.  That would mean  And people are  dumb opiate  and this is the thing  it's like okay  you would think  because we just talk  the way we do  and just that's  what we practice doing.  This guy  it's like someone  did something research  that said  okay if people know  one  you might be gay  or two  you're sleeping  with the girl  so that fucks up  the fantasy  of everything.  But I'm just  saying I watched  something where  Thomas Dewey  lost  this is how stupid 
[01:55:30]  people are I'm saying  Thomas Dewey  didn't win the presidency  because he had a mustache  like that kind of shit  people are that fucking  stupid where  that could really  fuck up the movie  so this little prick  is just trying  to be a star.  And I gotta say something  because remember I said  that I might have  another take on this  a few people are going  what if Ryan Seacrest  was in on this  because  you know  everyone wants to know  the answer to this question  so he's playing along  and I was going  oh that's very interesting  until I saw this video  and the publicist 
[01:56:00]  you can't act cunt  you just are cunt  yes  that woman is  a cunt  she's not acting that  you can feel cunt  you can fucking  you can't act cunt  you just are  it just springs down  to that monitor  yes she's a  she's a unforgiving  like she just  in anything she does  if you go I'm sorry  I did what I did  it's just  you're gonna get  alright let's play it out  she's not been slapped down  by the business  cause now this is the part  where it all goes bad  yeah  oh we need sound  I fucked up 
[01:56:30]  oh B  I'm sorry  the finale of the press tour  and everything  and you kind of  you have to sort of  please everybody  yes  what do you say  to your fans  who are desperate  to know  about you and your  co-star Kristen  what can you tell them  what can you tell them  about it  I can tell them  to watch you  you can't ask that question  you can't ask that question  to the guy  it's his co-star  it's a fair question  thank you very much  I was just cut off 
[01:57:00]  for the first time ever  the thing I can say  to them is  watch new moon  it's amazing  hey thank you  unless  here's the only thing  that gives me an indication  that they might be in on it  he says  what can you say  to your fans  and she starts  giving the cut sign  he hadn't indicated  at all  him  yeah but it's so  out there  and obvious though  Jimmy  I mean  they're doing  half hour shows on this  are they dating  or are they not  talking about how  they got into  separate vehicles 
[01:57:30]  from an airport  it's everything  on those Hollywood shows  here's the fucking  other phoniness  why not lie  like why not  just say no  what is this  fucking  teasy shit  because they like  to chatter  that is causing  chatter  people are  chattering  chatter  you want to see  another video  I almost fired  Pete my agent  because he said  he wanted me to do  something to create  chatter  I had to hang up  on him  because if I heard  another word  out of his mouth  he was going  to be fired  Jimmy  if you fire him 
[01:58:00]  can you put me  on speaker phone  with you  I would love  to hear his reaction  he should create  chatter  I would love  to hear his reaction  when you fire him  he would have no idea  and I love people  it would be a lot of fun  let's just fire him  for the hell of it  terrible outfits  the risky business  risky business  I can't see that enough  these guys haven't seen  seen that video yet  it's funnier  the more you  you watch it  yeah absolutely  have you seen  the black girls  sitting on the toilet  oh jeez  sitting on the toilet

Nothing.  I actually...  The dog had just walked a little bit, too.  The dog walked a little bit, too.  That voice sounds familiar.  The fugitive has called before, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think the fugitive has called before.  He's probably pranked us before.  Yeah, I think so. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, that's for sure.  All right, we've got a break.  Patrice is going to be at the Stress Factory tonight, tomorrow, on Saturday in New Brunswick,  New Jersey.  Vinny's Fine Comedy Club.  We've got the inside edition, Tiniest Mom.  Oh, good.  Got a little audio on that.  That fucking freak.  We've got a rape joke that was on The View.  What?  Oh, yeah.  And Patrice brought in a shock collar today.  Cool.  And he wants to explain next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Ah, some good white boy music right here. 
[02:10:00]  Neil Young, Patrice?  I saw a special.  Yeah?  And I feel bad.  What?  What happened?  I lost the rage fist.  Oh.  Patrice?  I saw a PBS special on Neil Young, and I have to apologize to white folks.  He is an iconic person.  Ah, damn.  Real artist.  You didn't know?  Real fucking mean motherfucker who does things against the grain. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's not as famous as he should have been, but he's a legend to his peers.  Yes.  His peers love him.  Yes.  They respect him.  More made a lot more money than him, but no one has more respect than fucking Neil Young.  He's a goddamn trooper.  And I didn't, in black world, he's a fucking nobody.  He's nobody, yeah.  And then in white world, I've just watched it, just like something else I discovered. 
[02:11:00]  In the black world, who would he be?  He, in black world, oh, that's what he's...  Petty Ledbetter.  In black world, if you said, say Drake.  Wow.  No idea.  I have no fucking idea.  He's very famous.  Drake is very famous.  Only for the fucking delicious treats he makes.  Yeah.  I love a good devil dog.  I mean, he's not, he doesn't have, I mean, people have taken this completely literal, but  it's like, in black world, Drake is known. 
[02:11:30]  And Neil Young is, from what I saw in this fucking PBS special, it was, it was, he's  somebody that should be fucking up there.  He's known in the white world, too, by the way.  He was a boxer.  He was.  Yeah?  Drake LaMotta.  I'm sorry. 
[02:12:00]  I don't know why I said that fucking name, but it's just like, but Drake, all right.  Yeah, there's no, there's no black counterpart to fucking Neil Young.  Um, I ate his fucking delicious treat, it was bigger than yours.  What's Marvin Gaye to white people?  Dead.  I was going to say something else.  So was I, but he only asked for a one-word answer.  Yeah, white people know Marvin Gaye. 
[02:12:30]  But I'm saying, what is, what is he to white people?  We only know, like, two songs, you probably can name a million, but.  What is he to people?  Like, what is he to white people?  I don't know, I don't know.  Motown, famous Motown guy.  But it's not like, he's not more as special as Neil Young is, right?  Now it's different genres and all sorts of shit.  He's as known.  Yeah, let's move on.  All right.  What's up with the collar you brought in?  Oh.  This is, it looks fucking dangerous.  Look it, I only brought it in to say this.  I, I, you know, I have this little dog. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Is it retarded, by the way?  Did we ever get the answer to that?  No, he's not retarded.  He's turning into quite a decent, uh, dog.  He, he shits like, uh.  When it's supposed to?  When he humps his back.  It's just, he humps his back constantly.  He's taking shits.  And he's a little dog, but he's taking adult shits.  That hunches back shit.  We're just trying, as soon as I see him hunches back, I want to kick him through a window.  But he's fucking.  That's just squeezing.  I'm trying to find the right food combination.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, me and my girl are just trying to figure out the right, uh, ingredient, like, the right 
[02:13:30]  food combinations to get his shit, like, perfectly, perfectly pick up, uh, uh, consistency.  Oh, consistency, yeah.  So, to not mush it or not too hard so he's straining.  But, we, we're close.  But anyway, he'll shit with you.  What the fuck?  That is brilliant.  Why don't dog owners do that more often?  What do you mean?  Where you figure out what kind of food to give them so, so the, the cleanup isn't a hassle.  I, I don't want to.  It's not a runny fucking mess.  I don't want it to sound like a coin when it hits the fucking. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, you don't want it to just bounce off the floor.  But you also don't want it to just be just fucking.  Oh, fucking pudding.  Watery.  I want to feed it.  I want to feed it twine so I can just pull it out.  Yeah, feed it glad baggies too so it shits in a bag.  That's pretty fucking good.  So, it's a pain in the ass but, but, you know, he's a, he's a Westie so he's real rough.  And I'm reading about him on the back end.  I bought him because he was already spaded and, you know, and, and he was at the, he was on sale and all kind of shit. 
[02:14:30]  And at the end of the day, these dogs are horrible dogs.  Like, this is like Jack Russell's or they just, they just, they warn you that these dogs stink.  Like, and this dog, he, he, he sucks.  He's, he's exactly what he's supposed to be.  What kind of dog is he?  A Westie.  West Highland, tell me.  And he's just an asshole.  But at the end of the day, um, I, I'm not the dog whisperer.  I don't know how to snap.  I don't know how to these fucking, these things when I grew up.  If a dog shit, you fucking boot it in his ass and strangle it. 
[02:15:00]  You still loved it, but you beat the dog.  You beat the, punch that motherfucker wherever his kidneys are.  You just fucking hit it.  It was put his nose in it.  You, you shove his nose and shit.  No, no, no.  And then you smack him.  You roll up a Bible and you fucking hit that motherfucker on his eye.  You roll a Bible up.  And so he was just frustrating me.  Just frustrating me with this, with this, I can't hit him shit.  Gotcha.  So I went to PetSmart.  Okay.  And purchased, um, this is PetSmart now. 
[02:15:30]  Reputable company.  Yes.  It's not, mind you, it's not fucking, uh, Vic.com or, or fuckthesedogs.com.  It's PetSmart, where they have wonderful things, food and everything for your dog.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a case and it's locked up.  You gotta have somebody unlock it.  Oh.  It's just a bunch of training collars.  And I, I bought one thinking, okay, let me just buy this and, you know, it'll just help me out if he's doing things.  And I don't, I just, you know.  And I bought this collar and I, I, I tried it on myself and it has 10 settings. 
[02:16:00]  I tried it on six.  I put it on my knee and my knee stuck, my leg poked straight out.  And I didn't have a shit on the rug since.  But this fucking thing.  When you said earlier that you tried it once on yourself, you'll never try it again.  I've never said, I, I, it hurts.  It fucking hurts.  So I put it on my dog once.  Like, I just put it on just to see what happened.  I, I, I pushed it.  I put it on five.  You didn't push it just to push it.  Did you wait for the dog to at least do something wrong? 
[02:16:30]  No, no, no, I just, I tested it and that fuck was on my lap.  He jumped up in the air and landed and started looking around to go, what the fuck just happened?  Like the look on his face, I, I, I threw the collar off of him and hugged him.  Like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.  Like, cause the way he looked, the look was like, just like an abusive parent.  You beat him up and then hugged him.  That's great.  Like you didn't, like the way the fucking dog looked, it, it, it, it made the only look that it could make. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  That, that made me feel bad, which is what just happened.  What was that?  Not that you did something to me, but it was just like, oh my God, that hurt.  Oh, daddy, protect me from that.  Yes.  And I, I just fucking held him for 30 seconds to like maybe two minutes.  I'm just like, I'm so sorry.  And I, I kept it.  It's like 120 bucks.  I kept it just to, just to have it, just to say, this is so fucking wrong.  It's just so wrong.  This fucking thing.  Put it on some bitches. 
[02:17:30]  Can we put it on your bitches?  I, that's why I didn't, you know, no, we should do.  I, I see what Danny's doing.  I think we're on the same page.  Yeah, we are.  The virus should wear it and be punished if he doesn't come up with a fucking punchline.  Right, Danny?  Okay.  Put it around his like cap.  Yeah.  Not his next five.  Oh, God.  Put it around his leg.  And then when he, when he says something, when he doesn't come up with a punchline, you  hit the button.  And then the number, the number goes up by one each time. 
[02:18:00]  Can someone set up the microphone?  Start on number one.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  You got a call for him.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Where is he?  We're all looking down the long hallway.  You put it on two.  Two?  Jimmy, would you try two?  Yes.  All right.  Jimmy, we'll try two.  Where are you going to try?  Don't put it any higher, though.  Yeah.  Okay.  He doesn't trust him.  He goes, let me see.  And one is a sound.  This is, the training technique is supposed to be, yeah, put it to the, put it to the 
[02:18:30]  mic.  It's supposed to be sound.  That's fine.  To say, to warn them.  So one is no shock, it's just the sound.  No, no, it's two buttons.  You go, it's like, if it's doing something wrong, you go, you beep, here comes next.  You know what comes next.  You know.  All right, Jimmy's putting it around his wrist for two?  For two.  This is two.  You don't feel it?  I'm sure I will on three.  Three.  Ah.  That's three?  And he just goes, ah, ah. 
[02:19:00]  What does it feel like, Jimmy?  It feels like you're being, it feels like you're being pinched.  A pinch?  Hold on.  Yeah, they use this in domination and shit, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Go to four.  Go to four.  It's unpleasant.  Go to five.  Oh, that hurts.  I see the muscles in your arm just started flexing.  Is that actually shocking you?  That's really weird.  It fucking hurts.  Here's what it feels like.  It feels like the two pieces of metal are going into your skin and twisting, like, not 
[02:19:30]  like you're being stabbed, but like someone has a screwdriver and just twisting, it feels  like your skin is wrapping around metal.  Ah.  Jeez, that doesn't sound like that.  If Patrice did six on his knee, I'll do six on my arm, even though it does hurt.  All right.  Jimmy's six.  No, go to seven.  Go to seven?  No, he went to seven.  Sneaky.  Try to hurt the white man.  Good.  Is that going to six?  Yeah, that's a poke.  I'm going to seven.  I can see the muscles in his arms are contracting, which is funny.  Yeah, it's unpleasant.  Wow.  It's fucking...  Go to eight. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  Go to eight.  I'll see what it does like.  Yeah, that one you really feel.  That's like a whoa.  Ah, that's probably for a bigger dog.  I don't know what it's for.  What would your dog be doing to preserve that?  Fucking your chick in the face?  If your dog is holding your grandmother down and fucking her face, you hit him on eight.  You put him on...  That's what I said.  This thing is...  This thing is not a training tool.  It's fucking cruel.  Does it at least come with instructions?  Yeah.  Go to nine. 
[02:20:30]  Fuck it.  I'll try nine.  Go to nine.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy on nine.  I got to do nine right here.  It's a dog shot collar.  On his arm.  It goes up to ten.  Go ten, Jimmy.  No, go ten.  Ten?  No, nine, nine.  Do nine for that.  Nine.  Oh, fuck, man.  That hurts.  Yeah, I'm not doing ten.  You feel that.  Jimmy's going to put it on his nipple.  That's too strong, but you definitely feel it, man.  It's...  It's...  Wow.  Look at my skin.  What's the matter?  You got marks?  No, just little ones.  Nothing major. 
[02:21:00]  Imagine...  I think in Domination, they would use that, and they wouldn't tell you when they're going  to shock you.  I know shock collar is at you.  Oh, my God.  The anticipation.  That much hurts, dude.  I put it on seven on my leg, and I'm like...  That does...  You feel it.  Kenny, you want it?  Come on.  Steve?  I'll try it.  All right.  Yeah, of course you will.  Watch out.  I came on my leg.  Yes.  Put it against my testicles.  No.  Steve's going to try the shock collar on his arm.  I'm not pressing the button.  Huh?  I'm not pressing that button.  I ain't pushing no fucking button.  You ain't pushing no fucking button. 
[02:21:30]  You're setting me up to kill Steve.  No.  I just...  Listen, I've done these before.  I've had...  Myself.  Yeah.  Okay.  I've done this before.  I fucking...  Why?  Because I've had dogs, and I didn't want to do it to my dog without doing it to myself.  Okay.  And then did you still do it to the dog?  Uh, yeah, but it's a fucking heartstring puller.  Fucking...  I don't like the way this feels.  But does it work?  Yeah.  The dog stopped fucking around?  I would do...  If you told me not to do something, and you had that, I wouldn't do it.  Yeah.  I wouldn't fucking...  But you still use it on the dog.  I wouldn't shit on the rug if you did this to me. 
[02:22:00]  So...  Yeah, but we don't do it on the rug.  I didn't put it...  I didn't do it on the dog.  What level?  What number do you want, Steve?  Would...  Jimmy, what'd you start with?  I started with, uh...  I started with two.  Yeah, he just went from the beginning to the...  Go right to the top there, Steve.  No.  Start with a five.  You start with a five.  Start with a five.  Did you do it?  Oh.  Okay, there you go.  Yeah, Steve might have a thicker consistency.  That big, leban-y skin...  Oh!  Sorry.  I turned it off.  Oh, my.  God.  Oh, Steve got cocky. 
[02:22:30]  Put it on nine.  Yeah.  He goes to the fucking...  I really got cocky.  Hold on a second.  I'll start.  I'll go five back.  Put it back.  Go on five?  Yeah, wait.  Let me make sure.  Oh, it's...  The warning's working.  The warning.  All right.  Jesus.  And...  It's a tingle.  Okay.  What number we're up to?  Don't...  What the fuck did you just put it on?  Seven.  Okay.  Ah, yeah.  I felt that one.  What number now?  Eight.  Nine.  I'll go nine.  That's what I did. 
[02:23:00]  I'll go nine with Steve.  Dog shot.  Whoa, motherfucker.  You can go ten.  Go ten.  Try again.  Oh, shit.  Steve's going ten.  Go ten.  That's a lot worse than nine, isn't it?  Wow.  You feel your skin tightening, like Jimmy said, exactly around the electrodes, and that is  fucking unpleasant.  And this goes around the poor puppy's neck.  Look at Steve's arm.  Where the throat is.  Holy shit, dude.  That's still freaking spasming.  That is because there's imprints in your arm.  Did you push it in that hard?  No.  Not really.  I'm glad I didn't go to ten. 
[02:23:30]  That's the skin contracting around the...  There's a big difference between nine and ten.  Mother.  Fucker, you are not kidding.  I just...  I said I couldn't...  It was so sad.  Where's the virus?  Get the virus in here.  The virus has that...  I've had to do a joke.  Strapped to his calf.  No.  Right to his leg.  You want the virus?  Yeah, I think that would be hilarious.  Where's the virus?  But he gets it out.  If he comes up with a punchline, you can't...  You can't hit him.  What?  Is he not coming in, apparently?  Yes, he is.  Why isn't the virus coming in?  Hey, virus. 
[02:24:00]  Get the virus in here.  If he doesn't want to do it, he can say that, but he has to come in and say that.  There's no saying no.  Where's the virus?  There's no saying no around here.  Let me go to Aaron in Texas while we wait for the virus.  Aaron.  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  My girl name.  Dude.  Hey.  I love that one.  That's crazy.  I don't get my ass kicked by 10-year-olds in the online gaming community.  Right you are.  He told you. 
[02:24:30]  I can't deny that.  Hey, what are the chances if we put this thing on Big A?  He comes out the perfect linguist.  Zero.  He would just go, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He would yell, ow, longer.  And we know he can't yell stop, so.  He has to yell stop.  This is an idea, guys.  This is an idea.  I like it.  Punch it out.  All right, brother.  Why is he not coming down?  Because he doesn't want to be shocked.  He can say no. 
[02:25:00]  He can say no.  And I really don't want us to have to go, ow, no.  Why, no.  I, this thing, uh, Sam told me to shut the fuck up and Eric said go away.  Here comes Eric.  Here he comes.  There comes Eric.  All right.  Iraq is waddling his way down the hallway.  Thank you, creepy voice.  Really?  What a ghoul.  He gets no respect.  He called him a ghoul?  He gets no respect.  He's so excited.  He gets no respect.  He gets no respect.  Thank you, like, public.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:25:30]  All right, we got Tits McGillicuddy.  He's coming in the studio.  Come on, Virus.  Get in here.  Well, you got to call for him.  Hey, Virus.  Virus.  Here he is.  Here's the Virus.  Hi, Virus.  How you doing, Virus?  What's going on, Virus?  What's up?  How you doing today?  I hear you're not happy.  No, not really.  That doesn't sound like the virus.  No, not really.  Why aren't you happy, Virus?  Not looking forward to getting shocked by a dog collar. 
[02:26:00]  Ah, well, if you have a punchline for a joke, you won't get shocked.  Yeah, that's fair, right, Virus?  We throw a subject out that's, uh, you know, topical, something newsworthy.  I know how this dick goes.  All right.  For the listeners out there.  Uh, and then you come up with some kind of witty little, uh, anecdote about the situation.  Right.  No, put it on your calf.  Calf.  All right.  So the Virus is putting the dog shock collar.  On his, uh, calf.  On his calf. 
[02:26:30]  And, you know, it's fair, Anthony.  If the virus comes up with a punchline, we don't shock him.  Right.  On the back of the meaty part.  How many seconds do we give him before we shock him?  One.  No, I give him a couple.  You give him the warning, the buzzer.  We'll give him 30 seconds.  That's more than fair.  Yeah.  30 seconds is plenty of time for the virus to come up with a punchline on a current topic.  There he is.  And in 30 seconds, if he doesn't, Patrice hits him with what?  A seven?  No, I'm going to start with a one.  Fuck the one.  No, you work your way up.  Fuck the one. 
[02:27:00]  I think you've got to start with four.  I say start with two and work your way up.  All right.  What are you doing?  Adjusting the, um...  He's making sure it's on?  Oh, it's on?  Make sure it's on his leg, too.  Yeah, he'll cheat and put it on his fucking ankle bone.  It's like falling off.  What that's all about.  The virus.  The virus.  This is great.  Love the virus.  I'm going to get to videotape this.  This has to be taped.  Patrice has got their cameras off. 
[02:27:30]  Patrice is trying to put this around the poor dumb animal.  All right.  That's good.  That's on.  Oh, shit.  What's wrong with your leg?  Pull it up high.  Like above the...  Exactly.  This price slipping on the mayo.  A little mayo joke.  Hold on.  Let me see if it's on.  Virus, move a little closer to everybody.  Right between Jimmy and Patrice.  The thing is, um...  Put your leg...  So I can hear the, um... 
[02:28:00]  The warning buzzer.  Put your cuff your pants up there.  All right.  The buzzer's on.  Here on.  Cuff your pants so we can see that beautiful gam.  There he goes.  That's the virus.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  This is so funny.  All right.  Are we ready?  Yeah, I think we are.  Are you really going to start with what?  What do you want me to start with?  Yeah, we've got to start high.  At least five.  Okay.  Yeah, we've got to start high.  It's got to be...  You can't lull him into it.  Well, should we start with three just to know it's on?  Yeah, I think so.  Sure.  Hit him with a three right now. 
[02:28:30]  You felt it?  Yeah, but not enough for it to be a punishment.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  You've got to go five.  Crank it up.  Okay.  All right.  Here's the virus.  He's got the dogshot collar around his leg.  He's got 30 seconds to come up with a punchline on a current topic.  If he doesn't, Patrice hits him with the voltage.  Right?  Yeah.  What if it's still...  What if he just does like with sometimes quarterbacks being rushed and they just throw  the ball down to the ground?  I know.  What if he just pops something at his mouth?  We'll make the intentional grounding film. 
[02:29:00]  Honestly, Patrice is the executioner.  If you don't think it's a...  Oh, no!  No!  If you don't think...  If you don't think it's a legitimate punchline, then you hit him.  Hit him.  This is a fucking...  This is...  You know what kind of execution this is?  This fucking is a firing squad.  Eight people got a fucking blank.  I agree.  And one person has the bullet.  All right.  That's fair.  I am not going to judge this if this is a fucking room judge.  But it has to be a legitimate punchline.  Okay.  Even if it's not good, it's okay.  How about...  Let's give a subject.  What do you think?  Yeah, Jimmy was just on Leno, so you know all the current topics you guys were messing 
[02:29:30]  with, Jimmy.  Carrie Prejean.  Carrie Prejean.  Miss USA.  Miss USA.  She's got some sex tapes.  Sex tapes.  And...  Very insulted on Larry King, and now it turns out she's got a lot of sex tapes and a lot of  pictures out there.  All right.  What do you got on that, Virus?  Go.  Go.  There.  I'm looking at the clock.  30 seconds.  There's five seconds ticking by.  Sex tapes.  Would you watch them?  Yeah, yeah.  Got 30 seconds.  30. 
[02:30:00]  Which is already half over.  Someone says, hey, I got the Carrie Prejean sex tape.  You want to watch it?  Yep.  Would you watch it?  Here we go.  Yes, I would.  All right.  He's got 10 seconds to come up with a punchline.  10 seconds.  Wow.  30 seconds goes fast.  It's five now.  He's got five seconds.  Three.  Two.  And what does the virus has?  No punchline.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  One.  The virus has learned a valuable lesson. 
[02:30:30]  Well, what sucks now, you've got to move it up to six.  How about, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  New rule.  New rule.  New rule.  We vote on the level of strength that he should be able to come up with a joke for this one.  For instance, Cary Brejean should have been a four.  Uh-huh.  Because that's, that's, so.  Yeah, but no one wants to see him shocked with a four.  We want to see him shocked with a 10.  Let's be honest with each other.  But let's give him, the easier the joke should be, or to come up with. 
[02:31:00]  The higher the fucking set.  Let's say if it was Lorena Bobbitt time, Lorena Bobbitt is a fucking 10.  Oh, man, I think, I think you just move it up one more.  No, because.  We can't give him hard.  I thought she was easy because she just happened.  That was easy.  How about this one?  This is a subject we did in the round.  No, they're all easy.  So just fucking put it up one more and give them another easy one.  Here's what we did on this round table last night.  It was R. Bert and Ernie Gay.  Because there's groups that have been asking R. Bert and Ernie Gay.  Okay.  From Sesame Street.  Because these groups were saying that they're both men.  So a bunch of jokes were written for that. 
[02:31:30]  So R. Bert and Ernie Gay should be the one.  Go.  R. Bert and Ernie Gay.  Virus.  You got a punchline on that.  It's the virus.  People are talking about Bert and Ernie.  What do you got?  In Sesame Street.  Virus is a funny guy.  What do you got?  He's got 30 seconds to come up with a punchline or he gets shocked.  Yes, he does.  Actually, he's got about 10 seconds right now.  Come on, Virus.  Go.  Joke.  Bert and Ernie.  One punchline from the virus.  That's all you need.  It's just to be able to say something.  You know who they are?  Three, two, one, zero. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, well.  Oh!  What happened there, Virus?  Virus.  All you have to do is come up with one punchline.  That's it.  And you don't get shocked.  One more.  I think you can only handle one more, Jimmy.  One more topic for the virus or he gets shocked.  Hey, can you put the...  Here's what I'll do.  It's the same thing as dogs.  Yeah.  I'll put the thing... 
[02:32:30]  And I'll...  In 10 seconds left, we'll...  We'll just...  Oh, 10 seconds.  That's a warning buzzer.  That's a warning buzzer.  But he has to have a mic by his mouth, though, in case he needs it.  Oh, shit.  Crank it up.  Yeah, just hold the mic.  E-Rock.  That's unbelievable.  Now, crank it up another notch.  Yeah, one more notch.  This is it.  This is the final one.  That's fair.  Yeah, so he might as well go up a couple of notches.  What are you up to, Patrice?  That was on seven.  All right, he's got to go eight. 
[02:33:00]  But you come up with a punchline, you don't get the eight.  All right, Jimmy, give him the last subject.  It's on eight now.  Eight out of ten.  What else did we do last night?  The dog shot collar.  It was...  Hold on.  We did Walmart clothes.  We did...  Pajon.  Bert Nerny.  Bert Nerny.  Pajon.  And it's just a finger.  You don't want to hear that sound.  Um, how about... 
[02:33:30]  Something easy.  I'm trying to think of something easy.  It's so wrong.  I don't even have a fucking hot topic.  Are you all right, Eric?  No, man.  I mean, um...  He's not happy.  Fucking, what's his name?  The virus.  The virus, I'm sorry.  V, yo, V, you okay?  Michael Jackson's movie.  Fucking Steve making sure his face doesn't drop dead.  How about Michael Jackson's movie?  Michael Jackson's movie.  All right, let's set this up.  The virus, the Michael Jackson movie.  You got 30 seconds to come up with any type of punchline about Michael Jackson.  If you don't do it in 30 seconds, you get shocked with an 8 out of 10 on the dog shot collar. 
[02:34:00]  And go!  Time's a ticking.  Michael Jackson's movie.  One punchline about Michael Jackson or Michael Jackson's movie.  Come on.  Don't dare yell out some hack Michael Jackson.  Come on.  15 seconds to go for one punchline from the virus.  Come on, virus.  You think you got one, virus?  There he goes.  Got one punchline about Michael Jackson or Michael Jackson's movie.  Oh, no.  Four, three, two, one. 
[02:34:30]  Hit him again.  I can't.  You okay?  Virus, you okay?  Virus, you all right?  What happened?  That hurt.  Virus, you okay?  Who would do this to their dog?  Virus ain't talking.  We just did. 
[02:35:00]  Virus, you all right?  You all right, virus?  Yeah.  What's the matter?  What's going on?  That hurt?  Feels like you just got stabbed.  He's filling the virus character.  Yeah, I like that.  Thank you.  All right, let's thank the virus.  Yeah, thank you, virus.  I guess we shouldn't give him one more for good measure.  No, we take it off.  Just keep shocking him until he takes the collar off.  Take it off, virus.  Yeah, take it off.  Virus, take it off.  Take it off, quick.  Take off the virus, quick.  Quick, quick.  Because he's going to get you. 
[02:35:30]  Please, no, I can't.  You can't do it.  You got a couple of holes in your leg.  Oh, jeez.  Fucking virus.  Oh, no.  Hi, nigh.  Hi, nigh.  Let it be known, by the way.  I'm stepping on a character.  E-Rock has never said no to us.  He has done everything we've ever asked.  That's a great copy.  Until he asked him to fucking make us a DVD for a lot of people and he gave us a CD.  Oh, that's right.  E-Rock, what happened with that?  What?  I wanted you to make a DVD last week. 
[02:36:00]  You made a CD, audio.  Remember I asked you to burn it?  Yeah, to cut up the footage.  Shock him, he's got a puzzle.  No, see, I don't know.  The fucking DVD I gave you, the video.  I cut that up and I handed it to you.  Yeah, but you made it a CD.  If this was an EW, would you put it on his neck, Ovi?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to put it on his neck today.  I haven't learned any lessons.  I haven't learned any lessons.  These guys keep in the show saying.  All right.  I'll do one on the neck, but it can't be at eight.  All right, nine. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, you were saying the other way.  All right.  Wait, is this an encore?  Steve is outside on the ground doing the curly from the three students behind it.  What?  Fucking the...  It's up to you, man.  You can say no.  Are you stopping this bit, Steve?  No, I'm not stopping you.  Here, move the mic.  We're getting crazy feedback.  Get rid of one of those mics.  Why would you do it on your neck?  Because he wants to be a hero.  The back or the front?  Why didn't he plug?  There's a match.  Dude, how are we going to get this collar around that big neck of yours?  It'll go, but this is not Patrice O'Neal's call. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, I'm visiting.  I'm just promoting the stress factor.  I don't know.  Move the mic away.  What's that, Yorick?  Just dump it.  What are you saying, Yorick?  He was shocked pretty good on his leg, I think.  Yeah, I think we...  You know, this is where we always fuck up.  You know what?  Yeah, it's not bullshit.  This is where we always fuck up.  We got a good reaction.  We got...  Everyone got good video.  You know, you're right.  We want to take it to that next step.  You're right.  And the next step is usually right out the fucking door.  We just learned.  So let's just...  You're so right. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, yes.  Just leave it.  Yorick.  The thought of...  Yes, Yorick did a good job.  He fucking did a great job.  Here's what we just did.  We reached the crossroad right there in that decision.  One was right here where we are.  The other crossroad, the one we didn't take, is us going, oh my God, waiting for an ambulance  to revive a dead E-Rock on the floor.  On his neck.  And us going, oh my God, we did it again. 
[02:38:00]  The calls were Bob, that, we need an investigation, we're fired, shock jocks, shocking shock their  fucking employees.  It was a whole big thing.  But you would be heroes.  No, we would be Peter.  Alternate universe.  Anthony.  We just went to an alternate universe.  Dr. Steve texted me, no neck.  Okay.  While he was on the floor, though.  I was just talking about E-Rock, calling him no neck.  Wait a minute, but they made it for fucking dogs.  Dogs, right.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  It's not like their fucking makeup is any...  They have voice boxes.  It kind of is, and like, if the dog dies when you fucking hit it, it's not that big a deal.  Wait, wait, it can't sue.  You bury dogs in your yard.  I was going to say that exact fucking thing.  The difference, you could just bury it in the backyard, you don't know the difference.  The cops aren't going to show up with forensics and figure out what happened to the dog.  Right.  There were two unusual marks in the dog's neck.  Like, we didn't know what it was.  All right.  DNA was found on the tips of the electrodes that matched a fucking hippopotamus. 
[02:39:00]  He took an eight.  He took an eight.  I wouldn't go past a seven.  No, no.  He took a fucking eight.  And I was scared because I'm going to have high blood pressure.  And that's why I was like, nah, this shit's probably...  This has to be as much as one of those things they say, clear.  I think...  Yeah, it's...  What is it?  High voltage, low amperage.  What's that mean?  What the fuck are you talking about, a mingler?  So that means you'll get the shock out of it, but it's not the amperage level's very low,  so it doesn't kill you.  Is that what kills the amperage?  That's what stun guns are. 
[02:39:30]  They're like, you know, 10,000 volts, but the amperage is very, very low.  But if you get...  Tell that to that fucking Russian dude in Canada.  Well, occasionally things do get fucked up.  Don't tase me, bro.  Don't tase me, bro.  Fuck all that, man.  That shit is...  Fuck that.  I can't believe you did it.  I'm sitting there going...  I don't think a fucking person unless you...  Like, if you did it to an old person.  Yeah.  But like I said, my dog is eight months or some shit like that.  And he's a pretty...  Young, vibrant dog.  He's one of those...  And he's what they call a hardy dog. 
[02:40:00]  Like, he's a fucking...  You could throw him against a wall, and he'd just try to chew through.  It's just one of those dogs just made to keep going.  A little Tasmanian devil.  Yeah.  And if I...  The face he made, he's never made that face like of...  Oh, jeez.  So, you know it hurts, man.  Yeah.  So he took an eight.  Fucking God bless him.  And he has big, juicy, meaty thighs.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break. 
[02:40:30]  Find them eating that fish alive.  You want to see Barbaric?  Yeah, we'll do that after the break.  We got Patrice O'Neill at the Stress Factory starting tonight.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Thank you.  In New Brunswick, New Jersey.  And...  Hold on, before you go, I got to plug one.  Yeah, go ahead.  We only got today and tomorrow.  I'm at the Stress Factory next Wednesday.  Early show has six seats available.  Late show has some seats available.  It's the night before Thanksgiving.  You're promoting a show that...  No, no.  Late show has seats available.  Early show has only six.  Late show.  Yeah, it sounds like a show you don't need to promote.  It looks like it's going to be a nice sellout.  He's fucking savage. 
[02:41:00]  Let's do it after the break so we can spend some time on the fish thing, all right?  We go backstage.  Yesterday, we had Tony Clifton in with a couple cleavage broads.  And Ant was trying to make some time with one of the broads.  He made a nice little effort.  I was a little smitten.  Yeah, and Sam...  One of the hose bags.  Sam went backstage to get the scoop from Anthony.  Oh.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  Legendary singer, comedian, and entertainer, Tony Clifton stopped by the Opie and Anthony 
[02:41:30]  Show, along with a young, drunk woman who he claimed to be his adopted daughter.  Anthony took quite a fancy to the young lady, so we caught up with Tony Clifton after his  appearance to get his opinion.  So, Tony, how do you think your appearance on the Opie and Anthony Show went today?  I think it went very well.  I think we're all pros.  We're all sitting there pros.  Did you see exchanging jokes back and forth?  These guys, they stumped me a few times, and I think I stumped them a few times. 
[02:42:00]  So, this is good.  This is like, you know, this is like brothers in comedy.  Anthony was making some inappropriate comments about your adopted daughter.  I know.  Did you see me stop that?  I'm for real.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm telling you, if he would have gone just that much, I was going to, you  know, because she's my, you know, she's a hot piece of ass, but she's still my daughter.  You should treat her with a little bit of respect.  Absolutely.  I'm trying to make a nice lead at her, trying to teach her to keep herself clean down there,  the hygiene to do it right.  I don't want to stink it up for the guys or anything like that, you know?  But I think I'd like to, he's got to be making some money, right? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's got a nice mansion, a pool.  Yeah, he's very single.  I'm telling you, he should, I'll give him the number.  You call me, you call the publicist, and we'll set that up.  Because I'm trying, I mean, she's hot now, right?  And she's a young girl, a very young girl.  You know, she's put together great, I'm telling you, it's a great fucking piece of ass.  You know.  Well, I guess she's under 80, so I've got to watch my slate.  Yeah, but I'm telling you, you know, but she's going to be 18 soon.  You could take her out on a birthday right at the strike of midnight.  Fuck her.  It'd be great.  Yeah, I think it'd make a nice son-in-law.  While we were talking to the great Tony Clifton, 
[02:43:00]  Anthony was trying to kick his game to the young lady in question.  We managed to get a moment with Anthony after the show to find out what happened.  So, Ant, you made a new friend today.  How did things go with Tony Clifton's adopted daughter?  Well, I wouldn't say made a new friend.  I wished I'd gotten to know her a little more, had a little more time.  I thought she was very cute.  She was very much my type of girl.  Young and drunk. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  But there was no exchange of, like, telephone number or email communication?  No, I returned her a pocketbook, or her purse, if you will.  And I was hoping something, there would be some kind of connection there,  but I just didn't feel I could make that step and ask for a number or some shit like that.  So, it's one of those things that just kind of, it's gone.  Maybe in the future at some point we'll run into each other and I'll be able to go,  oh, hey, remember that time, oh, yeah, and then continue. 
[02:44:00]  And then it's time like Donkey Kong.  Oh, hells, yeah, yeah.  If she is underage, is that an issue?  Never has been.  Why would it be now?  I am willing to run what a lot of guys don't.  A farm team.  See, I like, like, the minor leagues.  Yeah.  And then when you're ready, you bring them up.  All right, well, great.  Have a wonderful rest of your day.  I'm at the elevator.  This interview is done.  Sorry, Anthony.  Better luck next time.  But remember, there are plenty of very young fish in the sea.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with O&A. 
[02:44:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony radio program.  Happy holidays, everybody.  Happy holidays.  Yeah.  Chris O'Neill is in the studio along with Daniel.  And his suit is here.  It's cream colored.  Happy Thanksgiving to everybody.  Oh, wow.  Happy Thanksgiving to you, O.  Happy Thanksgiving, Jimmy.  Yeah, whatever. 
[02:45:00]  Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Absolutely.  I fucking hate candied fucking vegetables.  Candy yams.  And no one candies broccoli or spinach.  There's no such thing as candy.  Do they candy, uh, what's those things?  Candy carrots?  Yes.  They're fucking horrendous.  No, they're not.  I'd rather drink out of a bedpan.  Fucking candy.  Yes, I certainly would.  Soft candy.  Just despicable.  First of all, you're not a cook.  No, I'm an eater.  That's exactly it.  I know what I like.  Candy is just a process. 
[02:45:30]  A little sugar, butter.  And you just cook it until it's just tasty and delicious.  It's not delicious.  You enjoy it, right, my friend?  Yeah, I'd eat some candy carrots.  I enjoy a candied Snickers bar.  I'd love it.  You eat candied yams.  You would eat candied fucking carrots?  Yeah, why not?  They suck, dick.  Just you cook them in butter and a little sugar until they're soft and tenderoni.  It's fucking horrible.  It's like eating fucking entrails.  This is what I don't like.  At that point, you should eat candy.  I don't like garlic mashed potatoes.  I love them.  I like regular mashed potatoes. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, regular mashed potatoes.  Very good.  But I practiced a grub, but I got a free from Pathmark.  If you buy $300 worth of food, you get a free turkey.  I got me a little free 10-pound turkey and brined it 24 hours.  You brined it?  Brined my turkey.  How do you brine it?  What's that?  You just soak your turkey for 25 hours.  How bad is turkey, though?  They're giving it away for free.  You don't see them giving away the fucking nice steaks or anything. 
[02:46:30]  Because people eat steak 365 times.  365 days a year, steak is bought.  Turkey, you don't see turkey.  You see turkey like you see eggnog.  Or you see, it's very seasonal.  Very fucking seasonal.  What's that?  People are terrible.  Every night on Thanksgiving, why are we eating it all year long?  Because it's annoying to cook.  When is your wife going to cook a dinner where the bird takes six hours?  Someone said $300 worth of food was Patrice Biden. 
[02:47:00]  Trying some snacks.  Come on, folks.  Oh, damn.  So, now, the fucking grilled turkey is fantastic.  Now, how the fuck do you grill a turkey?  You fucking brine it.  You brine it, so now it's about 25 hours.  Salt water and some different concoctions.  And some vinegar.  You, God damn it, you get your charcoal and your smoke chips.  I had mesquite available already. 
[02:47:30]  Sounds fucking good.  Don't overdo it, though.  No.  I think I overdid the smoke flavor.  You oversmoked it.  So, I'm going to lessen it for Thanksgiving.  Now, how long does it take to grill a fucking turkey?  Four hours.  So, the heat's got to be pretty low.  No, it's 350 degrees.  350?  400 degrees.  You get it nice and hot.  You put it over to the side.  Uh-huh.  And you, when that shit's 350 to 400 degrees, that fucker, you open it up, it's pretty.  And then you cook that bitch. 
[02:48:00]  So, wait.  How many, you have to keep turning the turkey?  Look at his little legs up in the air.  He hates that.  Poor little fella.  No.  You don't keep turning it?  He wants his stomach scratched.  Shooka, shooka, shooka.  You fucking just cook it.  You just leave it there.  It's like you got a good fisting.  It sure does.  You got a fucking ass cake.  I bet that skin is fucking great.  Crispy like turkey skin.  Turkey skin sucks.  Oh, barbecue like that?  I fucking hate turkey skin.  I love turkey skin.  I'll go chicken skin any time.  No way.  Chicken skin's fatty.  Turkey skin owns. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, turkey skin's not fatty.  No, it's delicious.  Well, it's delicious and fatty.  I actually fucking, I make turkey skin visors and I hand them out.  Everybody plays cards.  No, you don't.  I certainly do.  Hey, we got Keith in San Francisco.  Keith?  Hey, you guys.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Yeah, right.  I just want to say, Anthony, have a barbecued turkey and you'll never go back to  oven brine turkey.  It's the best.  Why is it the best?  Really?  Do you know what?  Just because it locks in all the juices and you get the flavors from the barbecue and 
[02:49:00]  you can throw some wood chips on there and smoke it a little bit.  You've had a deep fried turkey?  I mean, obviously you don't want to smoke too much.  You've had a deep fried turkey?  I've had a deep fried turkey.  That's awesome, too.  Yeah.  Somebody said that's the best.  I don't like the way it looks and the idea of deep frying a turkey makes me sick to think  about it, but I've never been told that it's not, if not the best thing they've ever eaten,  the second best turkey they've ever eaten.  It was ridiculously good and juicy and tender.  Yeah, people really enjoy some weird, just some weird food. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, why don't we go to Brendan and, uh, wait, let me, uh, yeah, Rob on Long Island.  I want to, uh, let me see who I want to go to here.  Uh, let me, yeah, let's say hi to Brendan in San Diego.  Brendan!  Yeah, I'll be, um, appearing this, what?  Yeah, deep fried turkey is the best way to do it.  Dude, your phone is shit.  Dude, your phone is shit.  No.  I can't hear you. 
[02:50:00]  How's this?  It's fine.  All right.  Deep frying turkey is the best turkey, boys.  It's not the best turkey I've eaten, you fucking idiot.  No, it is, Jimmy.  You gotta do it right if you ever do it.  Dude, I fucking eat, I had to eat right, stupid.  I open my mouth and I chew.  It's not good.  You gotta cook it right.  I don't fucking cook, I eat, dummy.  I've had the fucking deep fried turkey and it's not good.  Your phone is shit, you're not hearing right.  It's the best turkey.  It's not the best turkey, you redundant asshole. 
[02:50:30]  It's not.  It's the best.  Fucking hang up.  It's not the best.  Good.  Sit there, stupid.  Listen.  Listen.  I love mean Jimmy. 
[02:51:00]  Mean Jimmy rules.  Fucking mean Jimmy.  That was a mean Jimmy.  That was a good mean Jimmy.  Just say that.  Just say that.  Don't explain too much.  I love it.  People out there, they're getting good.  I've actually had that kind of turkey.  It sounds delicious.  It is.  It really is good.  It sounds good.  You gotta watch.  It's not frozen though.  The turkey's gotta be completely thawed out.  Because you put frozen fucking turkey into hot oil.  That fucking thing explodes.  Oh, it has to be.  It literally explodes. 
[02:51:30]  It can't have one drop of water on it.  Water on it, yeah.  It's just.  Really?  I've seen it.  I've looked.  People say it's the best tasting turkey they've ever had.  Wait, if you deep fry with water on it, what happens?  Fucking water and oil is like, you know.  I've heard that and I would have never known.  Go to YouTube and see all the disasters with people trying to fucking deep fry their turkeys.  Wait a minute.  It's great.  How do you get water off the turkey?  You have to.  It's a process.  It's a fucking process.  I would have had no idea.  I would have thrown a frozen turkey in there and burned down the entire apartment. 
[02:52:00]  You would kill yourself.  The apartment.  No, you gotta do this outside.  You can't do it inside.  And he's dead serious, too.  Sometimes you never know it, Jimmy, but he's dead serious.  You don't fucking fry.  That has to be out in the park.  You can only fry a turkey on the park.  Oh, turn the volume up.  Yeah, sure.  This is a deep fried turkey going.  In the apartment, huh, Jim?  All right, what do you do?  So now what do we got?  Your turkey is burnt. 
[02:52:30]  Your fry is ruined.  And maybe you set your house on fire.  Get the point?  Don't do this.  This is a PSA.  Fuck the PSA.  Barber.  Barber.  Completely.  Before frying.  And never put too much oil in your fryer.  Always fry outdoors and away from anything that might catch on fire.  Be sure to keep children and pets away from your fryer.  What if your pet was your turkey?  And finally, always read your owner's manual for proper setup and safety.  And here's something else you have to do.  I'm back on fire.  Here's something else you have to do.  What you do is you have to put water. 
[02:53:00]  This is a fucking process.  Yeah, it is.  You have to put water in it first.  And you have to try to match the amount of water that would be oiled to figure out how much.  So you have to put your bird in the water first to see how much.  It's going to displace the fucking oil.  As soon as it starts spilling over the top, that's what causes these crazy fires.  Then you pour that water out and then you got to dry that out for an hour and then dry the bird off.  What's that?  Go to a restaurant.  I started going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving.  God, it's the best ever. 
[02:53:30]  They do everything for you.  All right.  Well, that's not the point.  I know it's not the point.  Why don't you fucking have Walmart deliver your kids Christmas presents right at the door?  I don't have kids.  You know, fucking, it's the holidays.  I understand that.  The holidays are made for another family member to do all that.  That a boy.  I just enjoy a nice cooking.  Are we going to do turkey recipes or are we going to move on?  I say we move on.  Are we doing traffic and weather together and turkey recipes or you want to move on? 
[02:54:00]  You want to hear about the rape joke on The View?  Yes.  That's interesting.  Huh?  I want to hear about that.  Let's see what this is about.  Sophie from, okay, ABC's Modern Family making a rape joke on The View.  Let's see how it went down.  I think Sophie, you're a single mom of a teenage son who's 18.  Girl, you look so good.  I cannot lie about my age because they count and they, you know.  Yeah, you can't.  Yeah, I count.  What happened when you were 12?  Yeah, 13.  13.  I was raped. 
[02:54:30]  What?  She's a goddamn liar.  Damn.  There's commotion over that?  Whatever.  Very badly raped, you see.  Oh, here's Mythbusters putting water.  We've got a thermistor to check how hot it's getting.  We've got eight ounces of water to dump on it once we catch it on fire.  And we've got a gauge to tell us if the fireball we get is, in fact, 30 feet tall.  Two quarts of canola oil and some water. 
[02:55:00]  30 feet fireball.  No.  I don't think so.  This is it.  I think that was just the trailer for the episode.  I watched it.  Dude, they get, like, 30 feet.  30 feet of fire?  Just from a few ounces of water and some boiling hot oil.  Oil and water don't go together.  I don't know why I didn't realize that.  They don't mix.  Because what happens is when you pour the water into the, because the oil is so hot that the  water instantly turns to steam and starts rising, but it's bringing oil with it, so  it kind of atomizes the oil and it catches fire at the same time. 
[02:55:30]  What a team.  Oh, shit, yo.  So it's basically just, like, flaming steam, and it just gets over everything.  Flaming Steve?  Oh, steam.  I think it's in flaming clothing.  I like flames on my boots.  Don't throw water on me.  I'll explode.  You know, different proportions of oil and water will create different flames, but in  an ideal situation, you could get a 30-foot fireball on your kitchen.  So do people usually fry on the inside, or no?  Only little things.  Yeah, little stuff.  Potato chips.  Chicken. 
[02:56:00]  You're not going to burn yourself up doing that, will you?  No, but you'll burn yourself up a little bit.  You can't.  You can't.  Spill some water in there.  The worst thing people do with an oil fire, grease fire, on their stovetop is take water  and throw it on it.  What are you supposed to do?  You're supposed to use baking soda, if you don't have that, or salt.  A lot of salt.  Who has salt?  Something dry, you know?  Oh, you should have an extinguisher around.  Yeah, yeah.  Like anybody that has a kitchen.  What about a blanket?  I guess I should get one.  You don't have a fire extinguisher?  You don't have a fire extinguisher in your house? 
[02:56:30]  No, I think I should have one.  You should have a little fire extinguisher.  I've got a few of them strategically placed around the house.  God damn it, that's a good idea.  Are they easy to use?  What's that?  Fire extinguisher.  Yes!  What do you do?  I just unplug the whole pin, squeeze handle.  There's different types with different fires, though.  You've got to get the good ones.  You've got to just get an all-purpose one.  You don't have time to figure out which fucking fire extinguisher to use.  I never thought of that.  If your house is burning down.  Well, yeah, you've got to get an all-purpose one, but it's not water.  You don't want water.  Water sucks.  I have a little fire hose near my garage door. 
[02:57:00]  It's like a whole fire station at the house.  It's like a little thing, and the cabinet opens up.  There's a fire hose in there.  What a dork.  And a fire extinguisher.  We're all just getting angry at your fire station.  You're a fucking nerd.  You have a little red hat you put on.  If your car is fucking on fire in your garage or something, it's right by the garage door.  You've got a big hose.  You just hit it, and fucking high-pressure water. 
[02:57:30]  The one thing about fire extinguishers, though, make sure you definitely want to use it.  Make sure you need to use it.  Because I had a bat in my kitchen, and I decided the best way to get rid of the bat was with my fire extinguisher.  Just fucking pick it up and put it with the glove and wall.  I literally completely destroyed my kitchen with all that dust.  But you used the chemical.  Yeah, it did.  There was powder everywhere.  I never got rid of all the material.  I used one of those yellow powder fire extinguishers once.  I didn't know it was going to come out like powder.  I had a bat.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to push the bat toward the open door with this fire extinguisher. 
[02:58:00]  I figured I'd push it out.  In the dryer.  Like something got caught in the dryer, so the motor was spinning, but the drum wasn't going.  Oh, shit.  So I knew where the fire extinguisher was.  I was very calm and relaxed.  And I put the fire up, but that yellow powder chemical shit, this was in the basement.  It went everywhere.  Throughout the entire house, basically.  Everywhere.  Like all over the basement, all over the first floor.  If you just took your finger and wiped it on any surface, you were going to have all that yellow chemical powder shit.  I had a motherfucking bat circling over my head all night long when I was sleeping on the couch back in the day. 
[02:58:30]  And I thought I was dreaming that there was a bat, but sure enough, in the morning, that fucking bat was just hanging out in the corner sleeping.  I'm like, I wasn't dreaming that.  This thing was just circling all night over my head.  And I took care of it.  And then it ended up in the kitchen.  I said, you know what?  I'm taking a fire extinguisher to this motherfucker.  By the way, I threw out a monumental bomb.  Oh, damn it.  That nobody...  I can't believe...  Well, they'll catch it on the replay.  Do we have it? 
[02:59:00]  I can't believe no one has it.  Oh, Travis has it right now?  Was that Travis getting it?  Because he saw...  Oh, boy, did I.  Oh, shit.  Hang on.  Let's see.  I just got to find it.  Hang on.  It was a...  It was a monumental...  Oh, damn it.  I would have gotten the same reaction as how you were talking.  I just rolled a grape on the table.  All right.  I got it if you want to hear it.  Okay.  Well, here it is.  Because I had a bat in my kitchen, and I decided the best way to get rid of the bat was with my fire extinguisher.  Just fucking pick it up and put it with your glove and ball.  And I completely, completely destroyed my ball. 
[02:59:30]  Wait.  Just do what?  Pick it up and put it with your glove and ball.  You said that?  I know.  I'm embarrassed I even thought it.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  What's that?  That is horrible.  That didn't bomb as much as it was just ignored.  I know.  Totally.  I thought maybe I just...  I know.  I dreamt that I said it.  Wow.  All right.  I love a dumb Louise clip.  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[03:00:00]  But if you get a fire extinguisher, don't get the wrong one.  I'll get one, man.  Fucking dust or whatever.  Should I get a foam?  The white foam?  No, no foam.  What do you get?  Which one are they supposed to get?  You get either CO2 or there's another one with like...  What's just the one that's easy cleanup?  They don't use Halon anymore, but there's a type that's like Halon.  It's like colorless gas that you just...  It kind of comes out a little white.  It looks like white, but it's just the pressure thing.  And it just puts the fucking fire out.  What one would put out the grease fire?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  It gets rid of the oxygen.  Yeah.  Fires out and now what's the cleanup like besides what the fire did? 
[03:00:30]  There's nothing.  Oh, see, that's the one you're watching.  How about the cleanup is you're still alive?  Yeah.  Like, fuck the white dust.  But if you have a choice on fire extinguishers, you don't get the one that sprays powder.  First of all, when you spray the bag once, didn't you realize it was powder and then you go,  well, let me stop that and get something else?  At that point, it didn't matter.  Ask Danny.  You hit that fire extinguisher once, it don't matter.  You might as well just unload the whole fucking thing at that point.  This shit goes everywhere.  Because it's meant to do that.  Right off the bat.  It's meant to do that.  You know, it's meant to go airborne and extinguish anything that could potentially be on fire. 
[03:01:00]  It's unbelievable.  It does its job, but it's a bitch.  And that fucking bat was like white and still flying.  It wasn't even affected.  Finally, I think I finally threw a towel over or something, if I remember correctly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a black chicken.  Remember that?  What's that from?  You ever said?  Yeah.  It's a black chicken.  It's a black chicken.  What's that from?  What is that from?  Love and First Bite.  Yeah, it was the fucking Warren Hutton movie or whatever. 
[03:01:30]  Leslie Nielsen and shit.  Leslie Nielsen.  It's a black chicken.  What do you want to do next?  Wait, what should I get that gas?  I got to get a fire extinguisher now.  Yeah.  Get the one I asked her.  Why don't you get a fire extinguisher?  If you got a choice, get the one I asked her.  Get a fire extinguisher.  Will that put out the fucking grease fire?  It'll put out anything.  Yeah.  It totally removes the oxygen from around.  Why are you fucking talking about grease fire?  I don't know.  I never saw that before.  Now I'm frightened.  Jimmy's never used his kitchen, but now he's going to get a fire extinguisher.  I do.  I use my kitchen.  What do you cook in your kitchen?  How big is the kitchen over there? 
[03:02:00]  It's a good-sized place.  Kitchen's a good-sized place.  You got a few fire extinguisher.  You have a gourmet kitchen?  I got a shitty kitchen.  I'm going to redo my kitchen, I decide.  What's it called?  The one you said, the gas?  I have a great kitchen for New York.  I don't know if they still sell Hal on extinguishers.  What are we doing?  I'm not sure.  Hey, man, you fucking guys.  You guys have mess here.  He only got a few minutes.  Ken Jeong is here.  Get him the fuck in here.  Bring him in.  I think he's cutting some liners.  If you want, you can take a break or something.  Why is he cutting liners?  No, no, he only got a few minutes.  Why are they cutting liners first? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, fuck the liners.  Get him in.  Ken Jeong.  Dr. Ken.  Fucking from Role Models.  Used to be Dr. Ken.  A movie I really loved.  Hangover, which I liked.  He wasn't in it as much, though, but he was the nude Asian with no penis, so let's make  sure we bring that up.  No penis on this Ken Jeong.  Yeah.  You've never seen Hangover?  No, I haven't.  Comes out of the trunk of the car with no penis.  No penis?  Yeah.  He has no penis.  Look at that.  You saw the movie, right?  I did not.  So the stereotype.  Who the fuck saw the movie besides me?  You didn't see Hangover either?  You don't watch movies.  I saw Role Model. 
[03:03:00]  You liked it?  It made me laugh.  It gets funnier the more it was.  I was like, yeah, it made me laugh.  Yeah, it made me laugh.  Who brought him in there, and why are they not bringing him in here when we know we have  a limited time with somebody?  Why the hell are we not bringing him in here?  Who gives a shit if someone goes, hi, I'm Ken Jeong.  It's amazing.  And this is opening anything.  I don't give a shit about that stuff.  The guy who likes them at like 10, 15, because he has other press.  What are they doing?  He's got a lot of stuff.  Where's Ken Jeong?  Ken Jeong.  Hi, Ken.  Hey, guys.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Good to see you.  Hello, man.  What's up?  Keep going. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Over there.  How are you doing?  Oh, you don't have to come all the way over here, Ken.  All right.  Here we go.  Why are you all dressed up nice, Ken?  I just did today's shows.  I just came from the today show.  Oh.  Look how nice he is in person.  In Roll Miles, you were such a dick.  But in person, he's just a nice guy.  Ken Jeong's coming in fucking all Asian-y.  Like, what the fuck?  We're like, hello.  I do that.  How are you?  I do that.  That's the thing.  What's the matter with you, man?  I was born in the United States.  I still, like, fucking bow.  You can see the push. 
[03:04:00]  It's so bad.  You can see the push.  You can see the Ken Jeong push.  Yeah.  And somebody told him to get rid of the doctor.  I know you fucking did the doctor.  Oh, you got me a doctor.  You can't.  I don't care about that.  No, but you don't do that anymore, like, on stage and shit.  Oh, no.  No, I don't do that anymore on stage, yeah.  Yeah.  I used to play guitar.  But everyone, yeah, everyone says, should I call?  I was like, I don't, I don't, I don't know.  I don't care.  No, I wouldn't do.  Yeah, don't call.  Wait, Ken, you're in that show with, is that with, uh, Michael, Anthony Michael Hall  and, uh, oh, God.  Joe McHale.  Oh, Joe McHale, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Community, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Community is a, I haven't seen enough, but everyone is talking about community. 
[03:04:30]  And what I've seen, I do love it.  And I, I said yesterday, I gotta make some time to DVR the show and watch it.  Right, right.  Thanks, man.  It's really fucking good.  And Chevy Chase, someone that most of us want to hate, is good in this, is good in this show.  No, he brings it, man.  It's just really cool.  He definitely, he definitely, like, uh, you know, working with him has been great.  He brings his aid in.  Pricked to work with, though, right.  He's been fine with me.  I'll be honest, you know, you know, you hear about it, but it's just like, you know, it's  just, I don't know if he's at a, you know, he's just at a point in his 
[03:05:00]  life.  I remember saying something when I met him, I was like, you know, I'm just a huge fan.  And he was like, you know what?  I'm just old enough to appreciate that.  You know?  That was really cool.  Like, it was like.  Yeah, he kind of got a reputation over the years of being a little difficult.  Yeah, we've all heard of it, but I find him great.  His wife is like, I think, I think he was saying, like, we've been over to his house, and he  had that cast over to his house before the show began.  And, like, he was really nice to my wife and my kid.  I had two baby girls, and, like, Janie would go out of her way to make sure my girls had  stuff to play with.  Why a girl kid? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, they're two.  Yeah, we adopted.  In reverse.  No, no, no.  You have an Asian wife over there.  Oh, no, no, I have an Asian wife over there.  Really?  Congratulations.  Wait, he's not truly Hollywood.  He didn't leave his own kind of shit.  No, I haven't gone Hollywood yet.  No, no, I haven't.  Wait, did you really adopt?  No, no, I didn't.  Oh, that would be hilarious.  It's too competitive to keep up.  I was trying to keep up.  That's all.  Hey, what's the show about?  Because I heard it's good, and I've never seen it.  Community College.  It's about Community College.  Joel McHale plays, he's a lawyer who basically found out that the law board found out that 
[03:06:00]  he did not graduate from college in the United States.  So he gets disbarred, and now he's forced to complete his college degree.  He goes to a community college, and that's where it starts.  So the pilot started from him at the college, like pissed off, not in a good, you know, just  kind of in a bad place.  So then he meets all these Motley Crue characters, and then I played a Spanish teacher, upon which  the pilot was based on.  Who does Anthony Michael Hall play?  Anthony Michael Hall is going to appear, I think, in the Christmas episode, where he plays  a...  He's actually...  Oh, he's not in the cast?  No, he's not in the regular. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, he has a guest star, but he's great.  He's wicked funny.  I mean, he's really funny, and he brings it.  It's really funny.  Hey, was that your penis in Hangover?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What are you doing?  I'm sorry.  It was the last...  What are you doing?  I know.  It was literally a last-second decision, and I just...  It was my idea.  I pitched it to Todd Phillips, the director, and I said, would it be okay if I do...  I just felt like it was...  I was supposed to come out of the trunk with my pants on, or my slacks on, and I said,  I think it'd be funny if I could try it naked, and not thinking he would... 
[03:07:00]  But I was serious about the idea, but I didn't think he would bite...  He would go for it.  He was like...  He literally said, you don't have to ask me twice, and he was just like, do it, and  then we did it, and then he was just like...  And he made me sign a nudity waiver within half an hour.  What, you have to sign a nudity waiver?  Yeah, I had to sign a nudity clause saying I agree to be...  Fucking lawyers.  Yeah.  Damn, fucking lawyers.  It is now nudity waivers?  Yeah.  I mean, it's more important for... 
[03:07:30]  Oh, don't give this place an idea.  Right.  Somebody must have sued, though.  Somebody probably sued.  Right.  Yeah, what's that based on?  For actresses, really primarily for women in film.  You know, you don't want to be showing their breasts or their cooch on any DVD, or there's  laws about that, or how to rebroadcast nudity or something.  So, for guys that, you know, especially for comedy nerd guys, nobody cares.  Just show their dick, who cares?  I didn't see that scene. 
[03:08:00]  I didn't see the movie.  It's a good movie, man.  It's a really good comedy.  I know where it's so stupid.  He goes, I didn't see the scene.  I didn't see the movie.  I didn't see the scene.  He wisely left during the scene.  I don't see the scene.  I didn't see that scene.  Or the entire film.  No, I didn't see the film.  For the people that haven't seen the film, Ken Jeong is packing maybe an inch.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  That a boy.  Is it a grower?  It's a grower, not a shower, that kind of thing.  It at least gets up to some kind of respectability.  Yeah.  I got, the way I looked at it, at least I had.  Then he had the big, hairy fucking bush on top of it. 
[03:08:30]  I had the merkin.  Yeah.  Everyone thought it was fake.  And it was just like, yeah.  Did you grow that just for the scene?  No, I just didn't.  I've never shaved.  I've never done anything.  You're a mess.  You're a mess.  Yeah.  It was just kind of, I'm a mess.  I mean, like, I figured, you know, I have two kids.  I have nothing else to prove.  So, I figured, just.  Do you understand?  You shave it down.  It's going to look a little bigger.  Yeah.  Dude, I had emails after the movie came out.  Like, many guys have emailed me and said, like, if you shave it, you shave more visible.  Shave it around the base a little bit.  Shave it around the base.  You can see the push for Kim, man.  You should not be thinking that. 
[03:09:00]  You will fucking have it.  I know you roll with the, like, that crew.  Like, you're in all the fucking funny white boy movies now.  Yep.  And so, you're thought of.  And, you know, it's going to be, you're going to have a test.  I don't think one of them young white bitches is going to want to put that fucking, that  little, that little nugget.  That little, that little nub.  Yeah.  I'll be tempted with, yeah.  It's going to happen. 
[03:09:30]  It's going to happen.  It's a plug into a bank account, as far as the girl is concerned.  Is your wife Asian, Asian, or is she American?  She's Vietnamese.  Like, I'm crazy.  But if she grew up in the United States, yeah, she's very, we're both Americanized.  She's Americanized.  Yeah, we're both white and pink, essentially.  Where do you get your Vietnamese food in New York City?  I need a place.  In L.A., well, we live in L.A., we go to Little Saigon, Orange County, about an hour away.  That's where all the best Vietnamese food.  I need a place in the city.  There's a place called Mama San's up in Rochester.  That's the best Vietnamese food ever.  I want to bring her down here. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  I want to franchise her.  Oh, there we go.  For cheap.  What's Vietnamese food?  I've never eaten it.  You work very hard and they pay her nothing.  It's like Chinese food.  No, but what is it?  Vietnamese food is the best Asian food.  Yeah, it's like pho, that's like their signature dish, like a noodle soup.  It's like pho.  Pho?  I love your face.  What's it called?  Pho, like I think P-H-O.  P-H-O, pho.  Oh, they don't pronounce it pho?  No, it's like Vietnamese, they say pho.  Pho noodles.  Way tastier than Chinese.  Way tastier.  It's a little sweeter than Chinese food, yeah.  I love Vietnamese food. 
[03:10:30]  It's cleaner, it's fresher.  Yeah, it's less heavy.  It's less heavy, yeah.  You're not shitting 20 minutes later?  Yeah.  And they have, like, instead of cooking, like a nice pho.  No, no, let me tell you, their steamed spring rolls are to die for.  Yeah, that's good.  I love them.  Vietnamese food is good.  That's my favorite Vietnamese dish of this.  Just a simple spring rolls, man.  And they put a little cilantro on that.  It's like a little, yeah, it's just cool.  What do you think of role models, man?  When that movie first came out, people, not much of a buzz, to be honest with you, but  it's in the DVR, DVD world, it's really blowing up. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I think it's on cable right now.  It's on cable.  Yeah, that was $90 million worldwide.  Fucking $90 million, man.  It's a funny movie.  But that was a slow build for that movie, I'm telling you.  Right.  We had Sean William Scott in.  He does the show from time to time.  Oh, cool, yeah.  And he was in here promoting Mr. Woodcock.  And he openly goes, dude, this movie sucks.  He rules for saying this, and he goes, if you want to see me in a good movie, it was  role models. 
[03:11:30]  It was either the next movie that came out or whatever, I don't remember now, but basically  he was pushing role models, even though he was supposed to push Woodcock that day.  Are you kidding me?  That's great.  Oh, he's a great fucking guy.  I love Sean.  He's nuts.  Yeah.  I remember seeing him on the red carpet.  He's like, dude, this is the funniest movie since American Pie.  And he was just so hyped for the movie.  And yeah, it was like one of my favorite movies I've been a part of.  He played the king.  The king, yeah.  It's so funny.  That was my favorite acting.  He's so serious as being the king. 
[03:12:00]  It's ridiculously funny.  Yeah.  That was the first role I did a lot of, kind of actually worked on, like worked on as an  actor.  I don't mean to sound all actor-y and pretentious.  It was like, but I just, I was doing like, I didn't know any of that world like Dungeons  and Dragons.  So I actually like went to those events and like live events in Malibu.  And I was like, you know.  LARPing.  LARPing.  Yeah.  Live action role play.  I saw documentaries and write books on it.  It's an intense look.  It's an intense.  Yeah.  So I was like, no one's going to fuck with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And by the way, staying on the Asian thing, Margaret Cho, when she did her show, and I 
[03:12:30]  knew this for a fact.  All American Girl.  Because I listened to white people talk all the time.  Yes.  We weren't paying attention to this.  Margaret Cho, her show, it fucked up work for Asians for a long time.  Really?  Yeah.  Where they wouldn't give them parts and no shows, nothing.  And right now, a lot of motherfuckers, the kid that plays Sulu in Star Trek.  Yeah.  John Cho.  Working.  Yeah.  Ken's working. 
[03:13:00]  Fucking Bobby Lee's working.  Yeah.  Why'd she mess up?  Hold on a minute about Bobby Lee.  Bobby Lee doesn't like Ken Jeong.  Of course he won.  He mentioned on our show.  It's like two Africans that's working.  It's like we're both from Nigeria and we both go to work.  You know, you know, Damon, you know, Damon Johnson doesn't like the motherfucker that  played Ada B.C. from Oz.  You know what I'm saying?  So, it doesn't matter.  Bobby Lee is nuts.  I don't know if we can get the clip.  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  I think he's a little jealous that you're getting a lot of big, big Hollywood movies 
[03:13:30]  right now.  Well, I have him to thank for because one of the first guest stories I had was on  Mad TV.  He put me on.  So, and we did the Kim's of Comedy.  Do y'all get along?  Oh, I love him.  He's a character.  He's surprised.  No, I mean, you know, but I don't, it doesn't surprise me because he's crazy.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's like what day, you know, like sometimes it's hot, cold with that guy.  You know, it just is.  He's a weird dude.  Every time I see Bobby Lee in the comedy store in LA, he walks like he's just about to go  do something important.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Like he's like, hey, hey, hey.  And he walks by you and then he just goes and stands 10 feet away and waits to go on.  He's like, where are you rushing to?  But that's Hollywood.  But that's Hollywood.  But you can hear Ken, Ken is, you can hear it.  He is trying to stay humble away from Hollywood.  Yeah.  But you are going to, you're getting big.  I'm going to crack?  No, you're not going to crack.  But you're going to meet that thing that goes, Mr. Ken, are you ready?  I don't think it'll ever happen. 
[03:14:30]  But the good thing with him, he doesn't get recognized on the streets whatsoever.  Yes, he does.  He's Asian.  No, I'm Asian.  I feel it real well.  Oh, God.  I never hear.  Who was in the Kims of Comedy?  That was who?  But that was Bobby Lee.  That was Steve Byrne and Kevin Shea.  I thought I saw a hundred Ken genres.  Steve Byrne.  Was it who?  I know Steve.  Steve's also a psychopath.  Steve is nuts, too.  We're all crazy.  What's the other guy?  Kevin Shea.  Kevin Shea.  I know Kevin, too.  Yeah, he's funny.  They're all fucking funny guys.  Yoshi couldn't get on that.  He was too dirty.  Hey, you know Yoshi?  I know Yoshi.  He can get it.  He is dirty.  We got to go back to The Hangover, because this is unbelievable if this is true. 
[03:15:00]  Fred in Florida.  Fred.  Atlanta a couple weeks ago and was going through the movies and saw The Hangover, and my wife  and I went to see it in the theater, and it was just, we just about wet ourselves.  But long story short, I was like, God, I wonder if they're going to put it.  It was on the little headrest screen, not like down the aisle.  And they did not, well, first of all, when it came to the pictures during the credits, 
[03:15:30]  they took out the elevator blowjob picture.  Yeah.  And more importantly, when Kim Jong-il or whoever jumped out of the smoke.  Kim Jong-il!  Hold on a second.  The guy doesn't even know that.  He's just...  Dude, he's...  Hold on!  We don't give a shit what you have to say right at this second.  You called him Kim Jong-il!  Kim Jong-il!  Hold on a second, Fred.  Hold on, hold on.  No!  We'll get to you in a second, guys.  We want to enjoy that you just said Kim Jong-il.  Kim Jong-il came out of that car. 
[03:16:00]  He's fucking money.  He's butter.  Hold on, we're talking.  Hold on.  And now he's just talking.  No, a Korean dictator came out of his fucking body.  It was fucking awesome.  A fucking gun came out there and was fucking laughing.  My fucking gun was a cock-sucker.  Oh, my God.  Fred, back to you.  Now what?  That was awesome.  Now what?  They had tighty-whitey jockey shorts CG'd on him when he jumped out of the throat.  They took away your car.  Because it's a plane, sir.  Yeah.  They don't show nudity on planes.  Why didn't they show that one in stock?  That's what I got to know.  They didn't show the fake North Korean dictator's one in stock. 
[03:16:30]  And I want my money back on the flight.  Is that the scene where the guy goes, that guy was crazy?  Or that guy was wild or something?  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  Yeah, we shot a scene in my briefs for the airplane and for TV.  Yeah, it wasn't CGI'd.  It was just, yeah, we shot another take.  That's surprising.  He edited it on a plane.  You should see Caligula on a plane.  It's eight minutes.  No way.  Exactly.  Is that the scene where you're running?  You run away?  Yeah, I run away.  Yeah, and I did one take in my underwear. 
[03:17:00]  All right, let's say hi to John in Red Bay.  John.  Hey, I can.  I was surprised that you and Devin did that wrestling show.  Oh, yeah.  It looked like you guys went all in on that, especially Devin.  He seems kind of intense, and you seem to hide your head a little bit.  Are you all right, man?  Oh, yeah.  I was fine.  What happened, Kyle?  I sold.  John Cena threw me over the top rope, and I landed on this plastic thing on top of the  padding and top of the cement, and it had like a big crack, like a thud, and it really 
[03:17:30]  looked painful, and it wasn't.  I kind of, I was selling it, because I remember Carlito, one of the wrestlers, like, because  they were all catching me, all four wrestlers were catching me, and he was like, dude,  are you okay?  I was like, shut the fuck up.  I'm selling.  I was trying to speak wrestling talk.  I'm selling.  I'm selling the entry, dude.  Don't ruin my flow.  I really was doing it.  And Piven comes up, are you okay, dude?  I'm selling.  I'm selling.  Just fucking, just don't worry.  Just trust me.  So I really was just like trying to sell it, you know.  I bought it.  Yeah, it was great.  It was great.  The boys in the back, they were all applauding, and like Vince and Triple H were hugging me, 
[03:18:00]  so they were great.  I love those guys.  Did John pick you up over his head?  Yeah.  You know what would be great, as he was about to throw you, if you had your mouth by his  ear, if he just went, I want to suck your cock.  I would totally do that.  You know what?  He's such a good sport.  I would totally do that.  I would totally do that.  He's such a good, he's like a cool guy.  I would totally, yeah.  Have you had him on the show?  Oh, yeah.  John rules.  He rules.  A lot of those guys rule.  Those guys, yeah.  They're like, just about all of them.  The wrestlers are always cool.  We've never had any of them were dicks.  No.  Steven Milwaukee.  Ken Jeong in studio from Community.  Hey, back to Kim.  Yeah. 
[03:18:30]  Back to Kim.  What's going on?  Hey, I was just curious about your dance and then the What's It Gonna Be video.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks for seeing the video.  It's just my hack Michael Jackson moves.  I only have like, I'm like Nirvana.  It's like I have three moves, but I do them really well.  So, if you see every, in this video, I'd like kind of dance a little Michael Jackson-y.  But, if you look at all my appearances, it's like about the same thing.  Nah, you're a star of that video.  Oh, thanks, man.  By the way, when he was Dr. Ken, he fucking killed.  Fucking killed.  And did black audiences. 
[03:19:00]  And no one would want to follow him after he followed him.  No one is a dick guy, no.  Nobody wanted to follow him after him.  Who was Dr. Ken?  I was just never really, I was really always nervous when I did stand-up, even though I  was...  You don't do stand-up anymore?  Barely, like hardly.  I do a little bit.  We're allowed to see you do this.  We're allowed to make the money now, man.  You kidding me?  Well, I'd fucking, you know, work door deals and stuff.  You make a shill out of money.  Yeah.  How about you do stand-up for us right now, huh?  What was Dr. Ken?  Like, what would you, I don't...  It was just like kind of a, it was really like a, like a BET comic as a Dr. Asian guy.  It was just really like, it was really like a lot of Asian jokes and it's kind of similar 
[03:19:30]  to that Randy character that Aziz Ansari did in Funny People.  Like, he had kind of this Randy, it was just kind of like a, it was a parody on that  a little bit.  I don't see it.  Yeah, it was just kind of, it's like fun, faux hip-hop.  I don't know.  It's not even hip-hop, but it's just trying to...  You're explaining motherfuckers, your character.  Look at me like Patrice.  I know.  I'm just saying.  I knew, I met him as Dr. Ken.  Yeah, I know.  And he would fucking kill as Dr. Ken.  Like, he would destroy as Dr. Ken. 
[03:20:00]  He would have a guitar and fucking kill.  And he'd be in front of black crowds, like, just...  I'm going to YouTube that shit later.  I'll check it out.  Garth in Indiana.  Garth.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Garth.  Hey, Garth.  Hey, Ken.  I really liked your role in Knocked Up, man.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  You was in Knocked Up, too?  Dude, Knocked Up, Pineapple Express, Step Brothers.  This is Judd Apatow's fucking mafia.  What did this happen, motherfucker?  Why'd you do that?  I just auditioned for Knocked Up, it was like three years ago. 
[03:20:30]  And that was it?  That was really it.  Judd gave me a career.  I saw the...  I saw...  You hang out with Seth and them?  I haven't seen them in a while, but yeah, I was hanging out.  I mean, I see them from time to time.  And that fucking meathead that hates me from...  Who hates you?  Fucking...  He hated me since the show.  Who?  What is Porkchop Head that filmed that...  Help us out.  What's the movie?  Which movie?  The monster movie.  The monster movie.  What are you talking about?  Mask.  That monster movie where he holds the...  He hated me from doing this show. 
[03:21:00]  He holds the camera the whole time.  Cloverfield.  Oh, Cloverfield.  Oh, T.J. Miller?  Oh, T.J. Miller.  He don't like you.  He's a good guy.  Oh, fucking...  Really?  He acts like we used to go together.  He doesn't speak to me that hard.  Really?  Yeah, I've seen him in the last fact.  He's all right.  T.J.'s all right.  I got to tell you, T.J.  Fucking turn his head.  How come he doesn't like you?  I don't know.  I think I said I fucking didn't like Cloverfield and I enjoyed his giant head falling down at  the end of the...  But it took it personal.  It's like I watch it as a fucking...  As a guy who watched a movie.  Patrice beat the shit out of Cloverfield. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, he hated the shit out of Cloverfield?  I actually liked it.  I liked it.  I liked it.  It was...  I got fucking seasick myself.  For real.  I couldn't deal with that.  It didn't move around a lot.  Yeah.  Even though Abrams came back real hard with Star Trek.  Oh, man.  That was great.  I enjoyed it.  I fucking loved Star Trek.  Oh, that was my favorite movie, dude.  Fucking movie.  Also in Step Brothers.  That's a movie...  Are you in Step Brothers?  I was in it for just a second.  Just like a half a second.  And you were in fucking Furry Vengeance.  Yeah, that's right.  You guys are in it.  That's right. 
[03:22:00]  Don't fucking point at me.  I'm suing to get out of it.  I'm suing to get out of it.  I told you you guys in the movie together.  They said you were very funny.  Yeah, he left by the time we got there.  Right, right, right.  So when is that coming out, Furry Vengeance?  I think it's coming out in April.  All right.  Yeah.  Wasn't Brooke Shields nice?  Brooke Shields surprisingly nice.  She's so nice and cool.  Well, her husband is Chris Henchey, who runs Will Ferrell's production company, Gary Sanchez  Productions.  If she wasn't married, would you stick it in her fanny?  Oh, I told her many times.  Who's that, Brooke Shields?  I told her many times.  Who wouldn't?  Yeah.  She is married.  She is a fucking funny goddamn broad man. 
[03:22:30]  She is great.  Good sport.  Funny.  I heard she was a good sport.  Yeah.  Jimmy came back with a story saying she was really cool.  Yeah, she was really nice.  Really cool.  We email each other all the time just talking shit.  We didn't get that far with her.  We've changed no personal information.  You got a number?  No, I do not.  Well, maybe I do.  I think I do, actually.  I'm going to call her until I use Latice.  Okay, Latice.  Her fucking eyelash shit for growing eyelash is Brooke Shields. 
[03:23:00]  Is that a product she endorses?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll email her.  I'll email her.  I like Ken's answer, though, because he knew it.  No one says, do you have Brooke Shields' number?  You have to think about it.  You know immediately.  He's like, do I want to tell these guys because they're going to expect me to call?  See, that's what I'm saying, Ken.  Or do I really have to process it right now because you know I know it.  Those are the seeds of Hollywood where you have to think about everything you do or it 
[03:23:30]  can just come crashing on.  But this is how the mind works.  It's not even offensively.  Ask me if I have...  I'm you.  Say, do you have Brooke Shields' number?  Do you have Brooke Shields' number?  Yes!  But it's more sincere and honest.  I am fucking finished.  I'm watching Ken and I realize how finished I am.  He's just...  He's blowing up.  He's very...  He's blowing up.  He's very pleasant.  He's pleasantly...  You know, he's not a fucking dick, but he's very pleasant.  You can see it's not going to stop. 
[03:24:00]  I'm going to do something that's going to make the momentum stop.  No, he's one hit...  You're going to try.  He's one more hit away from being a complete dick.  I'm one more hit away, bro.  You can tell.  You can tell.  He's about to change.  Let me ask you this, though.  Let me ask you this.  We have to think about these things Hollywood style.  I'll start a public queue specifically with you.  We have to think about the reality of life.  Yeah.  And you could be the first, but Hollywood doesn't let Asians become superstars.  Jackie Chan.  Except for Bruce Lee.  Jackie Chan.  Mega star.  Mega star. 
[03:24:30]  He's karate, though.  That doesn't count.  I'm talking about...  How's your karate kick?  You got one?  Hey, how's your sidekick, big guy?  Lisa Lou?  Who is it?  Lisa Lou?  Lucy Lou.  Lucy Lou is the biggest?  Maybe Sandra Oh, maybe?  He fucking is in China.  He went back to China probably because the integrity of these movies was shitty.  I mean, he's used to doing new films.  Hollywood's strange, man.  Hollywood's very fucking strategic with certain things.  Man, I'm just...  Honestly, dude, I'm just happy getting work.  I'm just happy working.  That's all I have is.  Happy working and providing my front family. 
[03:25:00]  That's all I ever care about.  What about George Takei?  That's a good impression.  Yeah.  Well, they live the same lifestyle, so...  Wait a minute.  See, that's the answer I have to practice.  Do that one more time.  Like, hey, man, so fuck.  What are you...  I told you I'm happy, but it's not...  Well, I practice on my wife.  I say, man, I'm just happy.  I'm getting paid.  Do we have...  Do you have enough for the mortgage for this month?  I mean, you know, I mean, that's...  Why can't I fucking... 
[03:25:30]  That's all I care about.  Just...  Do that.  Just do that.  Be that.  You can't help it.  Do that.  Why the fuck...  All right, ask me.  Just...  Okay.  Ask me how I'm doing.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Fine, man.  I'm happy to just...  Cool.  That cucksucking mother...  You can't hear it.  You can't help it.  You can't fucking say it.  I'm just miserable.  But you've got to be a place for somebody to be miserable.  There is a loan in your apartment.  You found it. 
[03:26:00]  I've got to give you props, man.  You're great.  The Office is like one of my favorite shows ever.  And you're like on that for the first season.  He should have been continually on that.  You should have been one of the guys in the warehouse.  But it's...  Yeah.  That's my...  That's his...  I had to look at BJ Novak's face for more than half an hour a day and it just bugged me.  That giant head walking around.  So it was BJ Novak's face that repelled you from...  Yeah, just...  Just I wasn't...  I realized something.  I need to...  And this is probably childish and it's probably not professional, but I really... 
[03:26:30]  Sure it is.  I enjoy coming here.  Yeah.  Because I like...  It would have disrupted that.  I like...  No.  No, no, no.  I like the people that...  I like Jimmy.  I like Anthony.  I like...  I like everybody.  I like coming here because it feels like fucking friends.  So I don't...  I don't really enjoy being funny around people that I'm not friends with.  I'm not that funny.  That's why I love tough crowds so much.  But just to be professional.  Like when you hear things and you go, people don't like each other and they...  But they do it, but they fucking hate each other. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I can't do it.  And that's childish.  But I really...  But if you look at Judd Apatow, it looks like he surrounded himself.  And same thing with Sandler.  He just surrounded himself with a bunch of people he enjoys.  He's a fucking friend.  Absolutely.  Look at Rob Schneider, dude.  Rob Schneider is as close to as mediocre as you can get.  He personifies mediocre.  Oh, yeah.  But it's like he has a friend to cuff him and make it happy.  I would have loved just being on Tough Crowd forever and not be the star. 
[03:27:30]  Just be under fucking Collins' wing because I enjoyed the crew.  So when I did The Office, man, Steve Carell's a nice fucking guy.  Yeah, he is.  Everybody's nice.  I just...  It's just 16 hours a day of not your friends or not your thing.  Yeah.  You just get it.  No, no, no.  You're not feeling it.  You're not feeling it.  It's just...  I just couldn't...  Ken has to leave in like two minutes, right?  Or a minute?  Oh, I don't do it.  No, no, no.  They have a little press run.  Oh, it doesn't?  But I do remember...  Hey, Patrice, I do remember...  You did have one line I still remember from the show. 
[03:28:00]  And he said,  Damn it, Michael!  He said that.  He got a big fucking laugh.  You should have seen the stuff that I didn't do.  And that's what they kept.  Yeah.  18 hours to have that.  My diabetes, my feet swell up.  Someone didn't.  Listen, here's the important question.  Yeah.  Ken's promoting community.  It's Thursdays at 8 o'clock on NBC with Joel McHale.  And Anthony Michael Hall, I thought, was regular, but he's not.  And the important thing is,  how much influence do you have over who Judd puts in his next film? 
[03:28:30]  First of all, you stuttering cocksucker.  Oh, really?  None.  You never know.  They have meetings.  You know who's perfect for this?  If they need a stand-in for a cartoon turtle,  I'm sure there's a place for you.  Listen, we've got to get him out of here.  He's got a real busy day.  Ken Jeong is all.  What are you doing, dude?  We're really fucking funny.  I'd love to hang out.  You know, I'll be honest, man.  I'm a big fan of the show.  Next time in New York, do a big, long fucking day with us.  I would love to, seriously.  You guys are some shit with you, Ken. 
[03:29:00]  I'm so happy I'm doing this.  Thanks for having me.  Where are you going, Ken?  Where are you going now?  I don't have to go.  Is somebody a PR person out there?  Yeah, they have.  For real.  I mean, it's his job to say he doesn't have to go,  but for real, he does have to go.  Again, this is another L.A. thing.  I say, you know.  Ask him about who he's dating.  Are you dating the co-star from him?  Ken Jeong, like Jimmy said,  Community is a great show.  It's on tonight at 8 p.m. on NBC.  Thanks, man.  Start DVRing it.  No, no, I appreciate you guys having me on, dude.  Good to see you, buddy.  Ken Jeong, everyone.  Take care, guys.  I think we're done, too. 
[03:29:30]  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I have luggage with me.  I want to go home.  Jimmy just flew in from L.A.  His arms are killing him.  Look at him.  He's giving us all handshakes.  Put your bat and ball and fucking...  Yeah.  Put your ball and glove.  There he goes.  Why don't we get the fuck out of here?  Ill-fitting suit.  Fucking dressed like he owns a store.  What a prick you are.  This is what I hate, 
[03:30:00]  is that we have to compete with other serious interviews.  Oh, is that why you had to leave?  Yeah.  What fucking interview is he doing now?  I think Hits 1.  Hits 1.  We're way bigger than Hits 1.  Hits 1?  The mashup.  Oh, that mashup.  Oh, that little show.  It's probably better for him to do different stuff.  Actually, we're friends now.  Yeah, let him go.  Let's get out of here.  Patrice, Stress Factory starting tonight?  Yeah, I'm there tonight through the weekend, man.  Thank you, beautiful, for having me on.  Hey, fellas, I just appreciate being here, man.  I appreciate you guys having me.  I appreciate having you. 
[03:30:30]  Thank you.  Patrice is always very good here.  And it's like you said, you know, you fit in.  I do appreciate being around.  There are some people that come in here and it's like, eh, well.  Why do you appreciate us, though?  For real.  I hope he's got to hear it.  For real.  Look at the house.  What an asshole.  How could a guy from Boston, how could a guy from Boston, not Chickapie the night after  Thanksgiving, or Boston two nights after Thanksgiving where I'll be performing, not Chickapie or Boston. 
[03:31:00]  Right.  I'm surprised you fell for that.  Oh, damn.  It's still off.  I wouldn't think not to.  Your mic's not going back up.  He doesn't need it.  Happy Thanksgiving, fuckface.  All right, with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  We got all the plugs in, right?  I think so, yeah.  Big Mama prods on Twitter for the big Patrice O'Neal as well.  Yes.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow.  And we talked about... </pre>
