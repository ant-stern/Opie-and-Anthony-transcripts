<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically boisterous introductions, Anthony particularly bragging about his lifestyle.  The show quickly transitioned into a discussion of daily annoyances, ranging from a potentially problematic intern in the lobby to the aggressive driving of delivery and garbage trucks, and difficulties with building security and cabs.  This segued into a complaint about a Jewish restaurant allegedly discriminating against them, followed by a humorous anecdote about a celebrity encounter at another restaurant.  A *Always Sunny in Philadelphia* clip sparked a discussion about boardwalk antics and experiences beneath it,  leading into discussion of Anthony's successful comedy show and a less-than-successful performance of "Sweet Caroline" at Eastside Dave's birthday party.  This prompted a scathing critique of SiriusXM's handling of Eastside Dave's departure and their refusal to allow an employee, Roland, a photo with Bruce Springsteen, ranking both among their top five grievances with the company.

The conversation shifted to NFL football, focusing on the Jets, Cowboys, and Tim Tebow’s surprising success.  A studio chair breaking under a staff member, Travis, provided a comedic interlude.  The upcoming guests, Larry King and Chaz Bono, were mentioned, followed by a discussion contrasting the box office success of an Adam Sandler film and Michael Moore’s large house with the Occupy Wall Street movement and its eventual decline, highlighting internal issues and the selling of Occupy merchandise. A Detroit listener called in discussing the Occupy movement's presence in Anchorage, Alaska.  The segment concluded with previews of upcoming UFC and Penn State segments, and a brief, explicit rap song about guns and sex.  Jim Norton was also previewed as an upcoming guest.

A call with Mike Francesa followed, offering unsolicited, often offensively worded, advice on improving the show, including promoting conflict with callers and distancing themselves from staff.  Francesa heavily promoted his Twitter account (@racistfrancesa) using racially charged language and made offensive jokes about Tim Tebow and his own death.

The show then moved to video games, specifically *Modern Warfare* and *Battlefield 3*, with Anthony detailing his frustrations with a new PC and *Battlefield 3*. A lengthy technical discussion on video games, keyboard/mouse versus controllers, ensued.  Multiple callers attempted to explain binary code, including a truck driver and an electrical engineer. A hacker called in, recounting his experiences creating cheat codes for *Battlefield 2* and the subsequent consequences.  The segment featured music from Yanni, Kataro, and Tangerine Dream, a discussion about Pete Townshend’s “Rough Boys,” and Def Leppard, interspersed with listener calls and debate over the songs' lyrical interpretations.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the death of a musician.

The next segment began with a discussion of the death of musician Jesse Morris,  followed by a caller, Dan from Jersey, sharing a humorous misinterpretation of Extreme's "No Women Allowed" cassette introduction.  This transitioned into a lengthy, profane discussion of the movie *The Omen*, focusing on the child actor and punctuated by failed attempts to find specific clips online.  Promotional announcements for Opie's stand-up, a Billy the Bassman CD, and an Andrew Dice Clay Silverstein infomercial were interspersed.  The hosts then discussed their "Thanks for Nothing" show at the Hard Rock Cafe, the upcoming autograph signing (mentioning a pee-stained photo with the Iron Sheik), and the Jerry Sandusky scandal at Penn State, incorporating several caller opinions and details on the legal proceedings.  The segment ended with a discussion of the Velasquez/dos Santos UFC fight and a heated, misogynistic exchange with a caller, Suzanne, who disliked UFC.

A female caller criticized MMA, leading to a highly offensive exchange with the hosts, escalating into personal insults.  The caller, a clinical psychologist, revealed details of her personal life before hanging up.  The hosts then engaged in similarly offensive conversations with another caller, Sarah, who shared sexually explicit anecdotes, and other callers, Abby and Susan, continuing the pattern of vulgar insults and name-calling.

The final segment focused on promoting their Hard Rock Cafe broadcast, including listener karaoke, a mashed potato eating contest, and potential punishments for their intern, Matt, ranging from a stockade to a catapult.  Steven Singer jewelry was heavily advertised.  Other guests, including Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, and Pat Duffy, were mentioned.  The show concluded with final plugs and a conversation with Sam Roberts about his Twitter use, culminating in a story about his son throwing feces at him.  A final discussion involved Matt's sick day and his admitted attendance at a party, followed by a mention of upcoming guests (Jason Segel, Larry King, Chaz Bono, CM Punk, Brian Regan) and future broadcast plans.

[00:00:00]  and now the moment you've all been patiently waiting for it's the opian anthony show 
[00:00:30]  so 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beam from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony... 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy...  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  He's the dang open hand.  He's the dang open hand.  He's the dang open hand.  Stop it.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, fuck.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody. 
[00:04:30]  Is it really Monday?  Hello, everybody.  Hi, Kenny.  Hi.  Everything all right?  How are things down there?  Everything's good.  Yeah, huh?  We've had a couple situations this morning.  That's funny.  A couple situations.  How do you have situations this early in the morning?  A situation.  I had a rambling fool in the lobby.  He's on Twitter, by the way, and he apologized.  I have his resume. 
[00:05:00]  You have his resume?  All right.  Oh, look at that.  I don't know what happened.  The guy was coming through the lobby, and there's a babbling kid.  Well, he obviously got star-struck.  Oh, yeah, okay.  He's a young go-getter.  Look at him.  Making his way in life.  Coming here where he's got to be, giving the proper resumes and everything, and then  he babbles like an idiot and can't spit out the two words.  And then we just kept saying, what do you want?  What do you want?  What do you want?  And he couldn't tell us what he wanted.  Apparently, he wants to be an intern. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So.  Who doesn't?  He's good.  You got his resume?  Yes.  I snapped a photo of him also.  Well, he just apologized on Twitter.  I said, don't worry about it, man.  Just fucking get a hold of E-Rock if you want to be an intern here.  Get a hold of yourself.  That's what I say.  Yeah.  But then you and the guy downstairs got into it a little bit.  It was just a misunderstanding.  Because if you forget your ID, which I think happened to Jimmy today.  Yeah.  All hell breaks loose, but you get a babbling fool that pretty much could have went up the 
[00:06:00]  elevator banks with us today.  And he's allowed to just walk around the lobby of this building.  Yes.  I would assume they would have told him, you know, hey, what's your business here?  Oh, nothing.  I come to talk.  All right.  You got to go outside.  Yeah.  Go outside and go through the proper channels, right?  Yes.  How was it to get in there, Jimmy?  It was actually easier today than normal.  It's funny.  Yeah.  And usually the computer's slow.  Yeah.  And I couldn't get a cab. 
[00:06:30]  I had to take one of the livery guys.  They always have a, it's always an interesting trip.  Yeah.  But today was actually pretty fast.  Usually it's like they're fumbling with it.  They're like, the system's slow.  It's always slow.  There's nobody here.  What could be happening with the system?  The system is slow.  Their job at 5.30 in the morning, 5.30 to 6, whatever, is to let 10 people in.  Yeah.  That's it.  No one else is going to work this early.  A few of the Howard people and us.  That's it.  Yeah.  How tough is that? 
[00:07:00]  It's to make sure the stars get in.  Yes.  That's his job.  Make sure the people that are better than you can get in.  That's right, sir.  I would imagine that the rush hour for this building is around 8 to 9 o'clock where it's  just turnstile, turnstile, turnstile.  Oh, that's got to be crazy.  ID's going through.  This whole building's getting filled up.  Yeah.  But at this time, there's nothing going on.  Nothing.  They're restocking the food in the restaurant.  Yeah.  It's like trucks outside with food.  Well, the Daily News trucks.  To feed these fat fucks in here. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  It's funny you say delivery trucks or whatever, food trucks, because it just reminded me of  the guy making ridiculous U-turns in front of us today.  The Daily News trucks, and they did an expose on this.  The newspaper for New York City, obviously, right?  Yeah.  One of them.  Those guys are allowed to break whatever fucking law they want because they've got to deliver  their papers.  Yeah.  So they're out there just slamming the piles of newspaper on the sidewalk.  They break laws because they want to do their job as quickly as possible, and the cops leave  them the fuck alone. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Well, we had one today that just swung all the way around, threw a red light right in  front of us.  The side doors are open because they're just throwing papers as they go.  It's old school.  You've got to watch out for those fuckers.  Yeah, man.  And garbage trucks.  And garbage trucks, too.  Get amnesty.  Yeah.  They just have impunity.  They can go from the left lane all the way out of five lanes of traffic to the right  lane.  And if you're in front of them, you better stop.  Why do they never get tickets for running lights or any of that stuff?  It's a little deal that they've made. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  It's a little deal.  It's just been that way.  There's some deals that go on with the administration.  And if you want your garbage picked up.  Yeah.  And cops are very busy at that hour.  Yeah, of course.  They've got work to do.  Yes.  If they pulled over a garbage truck, are you kidding me?  What?  Right.  Are you kidding me?  You serious?  They'll take their fucking time picking up the garbage.  That's why.  So you give those guys a pass.  And you give the Daily News trucks a pass, I guess.  Garbage.  The precinct wouldn't get picked up. 
[00:09:00]  Exactly.  Be like, oh, we missed it today.  Exactly.  Big stinky fucking fly strewn mess.  How's the livery cab?  Because those guys are nightmares, too.  He was okay.  There was just a Hasidic guy in front of me waiting.  Yeah.  And he had first dibs on it.  Oh.  And he just kept saying, I don't have any small bills.  Of course.  I don't have any.  I only have hundreds.  He was saying that.  No.  Why would he say that?  Because he probably wanted the yellow, but he didn't want to tell the guy to go fuck himself.  Because I flagged the guy down.  But I'm like, I got to give this guy priority. 
[00:09:30]  And I hopped in.  I told the guy, I got plenty of small bills.  And what was the Hasidic guy saying?  I only have hundreds.  Why is Yogi Bear trying to get a cab?  It was really, I don't know, but that's what he sounded like.  I only have hundreds, boo-boo-boo-boo.  I laid in bed not breathing again wide awake.  Oh, no.  Will you start breathing?  I'm trying.  Believe me.  Do you tilt your head way back on the pillow to open up everything?  Sometimes I have to do that.  Not on your back, but on your side, but you kind of like stretch that neck out a little bit. 
[00:10:00]  No, I have to prop up my right side to breathe whenever I think about it.  It's all in my head, I think.  Aw.  But it freaks me out.  So what happened to the Hasidic Jew?  I think he had a yellow.  I was so annoyed.  As soon as I hopped in, my livery guy, the fucking yellow, pulled up for him.  We got some of those in the neighborhood, though?  In my building.  He's there every morning, though.  Is he?  But he's always sitting in the lobby.  I don't know what he's doing.  I wonder if he's praying or something.  He's always sitting there.  Yeah?  And then he leaves at a certain point.  Yeah, it's weird.  You ever go to that Jewish restaurant in our neighborhood?  They don't like our kind in there.  Where is it? 
[00:10:30]  I don't even know what it's called.  I don't even want to say the name on air, just in case I'm full of shit.  Okay.  But the last time we were in there, we like going there every once in a while, and it  caters to the Jew.  And the last time we were in there, they slowed down our service drastically to the  point to make their point.  Yeah.  They just want to...  And then I was suspicious.  Then I'm a little paranoid, right?  We walked by yesterday, and the place was...  It's a glass box, so you could see right in.  It was all jazz. 
[00:11:00]  So I'm thinking they don't want my kind in there, man.  Wow.  I don't know where it is.  In this day and age.  I don't know if I like Jewish...  It's on 72nd.  I like Jewish delis, but I don't like Jewish cuisine, because they don't like dairy, a  lot of them.  They don't have cheese.  There's always been stuff I wanted in Jewish delis I couldn't get.  Right.  It was frustrating.  Whatever I order, can I have this?  We don't sell that.  Why not?  But do you think that's happening in this day and age?  I don't know.  I think so.  I went to a Jewish-Italian place.  That's impossible. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  It's Roman Jews opened it up.  They're Italian, but they're Jewish, and then they opened up this fucking restaurant.  It was fantastic.  Was it spaghetti and matzo balls?  Ah!  That would be horrible.  Yeah.  No.  It was just really good.  It was good.  That was the place I went to where everyone from Saturday Night Live came in.  When?  And then Lorne Michaels walked in.  When did you do this?  It was like a week and a half ago.  Oh, was it fun?  Yeah.  It was really good food, and apparently a lot of other people think so. 
[00:12:00]  And then the guy from...  What the fuck is that show?  Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Oh, Charlie?  Yeah.  Was Charlie in there?  It was the little wormy guy.  Charlie Day.  Yeah.  He's a rock star.  He came in with his...  One of my favorite guys in the world.  With his pregnant chick.  Really?  Yeah.  It was star-studded, that fucking place.  It was star-studded.  And then Lorne walks in, and there's a table of other people that looked like somebody.  And they sit there, and they start talking with Lorne Michaels.  Right. 
[00:12:30]  They're just like...  And they knew him, and he's like, okay, I'm going to the back now.  Well, I think Charlie was hosting SNL, right?  Oh, that was the whole deal.  I got that on fucking DVR, too.  I'm way behind.  I got a big thing.  That's probably the big restaurant they were going to.  Yeah.  Tied in.  That's probably the place where Lorne...  Jewish-Italian.  Lorne brings everybody.  It was good.  Jewish-Italian.  That's kind of weird, man.  It sounds weird, but it's fucking, like, really goddamn good.  What do they have?  Just what kind of food?  Is it a combo? 
[00:13:00]  It was like everything.  Meat, fish, fucking pasta dishes.  I don't eat with the Italian.  I don't eat with the Jew.  But if you put them together, I'll eat.  Yeah, then I'll have something.  But they had an appetizer, artichokes, to die for.  That was very good.  You like artichokes?  I love artichokes.  Why?  Because they're tasty.  You take it with your teeth and scrape it out?  Yeah, you go, ah, boy, with the stuffing with the breadcrumbs and the garlic and the butter.  A little zuccotti.  Awesome.  You put the zuccotti sauce on there. 
[00:13:30]  A little zuccotti lung to go with that.  Zuccotti lung.  Yeah, but if you put the breadcrumbs on it, then you're not really having artichokes.  Well, some of the artichokes.  And then you're just doing that to get to the goodness of the heart of the artichoke.  Yeah.  And then you peel off that little fucking furry shit.  And when you cut that up, oh.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  Very nice.  It's so good.  Hey, you know, speaking of Charlie Day, someone tweeted a clip from Always Sunny. 
[00:14:00]  It's fucking, can you find it possibly?  It's, uh, it says, uh, it's, uh, Under the Boardwalk, yeah, I saw that.  Oh, you saw it?  Yeah, yeah.  Were you laughing your ass off?  No, but I enjoyed it.  Like, I was like, oh, it's pretty cool.  You don't like Always Sunny?  I've never seen it.  You gotta check out Always Sunny.  Yeah, I hear it's very good.  I thought it was hilarious.  They were talking about, they were walking down the boardwalk in, you know, one of these  Jersey fucking shore places.  And then said all, all the romances under the boardwalk.  It was an opportunity to win stuffed toys. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, man, the boardwalk is a blast, man.  But it is under the boardwalk where the action really happens.  Trust me, pal.  Yeah.  Oh, what's down there?  Oh, Charlie, come on.  Under the boardwalk where it's at.  Oh, yeah.  This is gonna knock your socks off.  You never know who you're gonna run into, what they're gonna be doing.  You love the bridge.  Yeah.  This is a lot like being under the bridge, I would say.  Oh, it's way better than that.  The under the boardwalk is a magical place, man.  I have a special place in my heart because I had my first kiss down here.  Did you?  Oh, dude, all kinds of romantic shit happens. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Two homeless guys fucking each other in the ass.  Oh, no.  What was that?  Two homeless guys banging each other.  I saw, but why?  That's not magical.  It's not romantic.  That's your idea of romantic?  No.  There are other kinds of romances that happen under here.  I don't want to see anything else like that.  You know what?  I'm out of here.  You guys are gonna go.  You get out of here.  Yeah, you get out of here.  You get out of here, Charlie.  Son of a bitch.  I liked it.  Oof.  You got two fucking scraggly homeless men. 
[00:15:30]  Just fucking banging under the boardwalk.  Anyway.  Fuck.  I saw Jimmy.  I saw Jimmy on Saturday.  Under the boardwalk.  Under the boardwalk.  It was great.  At the brokerage.  How was that place?  That was great.  Dude, it was great.  They took care of me like royalty.  Nice.  It was great.  It's a small club.  It's like 200 seats, which is perfect.  It's like, the fucking energy is great. 
[00:16:00]  I haven't been there in so many years, because I didn't want to work for the old guy who was  there, but I love the guy that owns it now.  Yeah, new guy.  Oh, new guy came in.  Yeah, he's got that.  He's got governors.  He's got McGuire's.  He's got all the comedy clubs.  Yeah.  It was fucking great.  It was great.  What a nice crowd.  Yeah.  Fucking a bunch of Long Island huge fans and shit.  Fucking animals.  Yeah, they are.  Chip killed.  Oh, yeah.  Chip did a little bit on stage.  That's what hardcore fans are.  Yeah, yeah.  Chip destroyed.  Chip destroyed.  Pulled out the chip.  You have to when they ask for it. 
[00:16:30]  How was the later show?  Great.  All four were sold out.  All four were great.  I mean, that's fucking great, man.  It's nice to do a gig like that where you just like fucking everybody's there to see  and it's like, yeah, I'm in Harrisburg this week, so let's hope it's good.  I don't know.  Hope so.  Not said hi.  Why?  I don't know.  It can't be as good as this one was.  Harrisburg's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was actually great.  Harrisburg I was there a few years ago.  It's a hot pocket of activity.  They love you.  I hope so.  They love you.  And we hung out, what, Friday at Eastside Dave's birthday party. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  Birthday party.  What a blast.  That Dave is just a shit.  He is great.  He knows how to have fun.  He certainly does.  There's a bunch of people, too.  Picture him.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, a bunch of people were there.  He really pulls in a crowd, doesn't he?  He absolutely does.  Yeah.  Oh, well, of course.  Eastside Dave made me take the stage.  Everybody has to do this. 
[00:17:30]  Eastside Dave.  Oh, it made me sing Sweet Caroline.  Oh, it sounds great.  Much lower than I'm used to.  You know, you used to be singing the drums like that?  What?  It's just lower.  All it is, like, a piano and a drum.  Yeah.  It was getting crowded.  Yeah, it wasn't too bad.  Another rousing rendition of this.  I don't think you've ever done this song. 
[00:18:00]  No, no.  Oh, no, he has.  See, it's very low.  And Dave.  Dave's just drinking next to me.  Rocking back and forth.  There were some real drunks there, I'll tell you.  Wow.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Repping the crowd up.  They're ready to sing.  They're ready to go.  Touching you.  Touching you.  See you.  I'm a girl.  What are they saying?  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl. 
[00:19:00]  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  What are they saying?  Oh, oh, oh.  They're doing their part.  Yeah.  They've had a few at this point.  Now it just repeats itself.  All right.  A bunch of drunks.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  It was good times.  Good times.  How old is Dave?  I think he's 40.  What?  34.  Oh, he's 34.  Wow.  It's a rough 34 year.  It's a rough 34. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  Wow.  I know.  He definitely has the body of a fucking 60-year-old.  Wow.  He's only 34?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you know, he's having a good time.  He certainly is.  If you're having a good time, whatever.  Every time I see him, though, all I can think about is how the fuck did this place let him go?  It's just beyond me.  Really?  Really?  It's fucking beyond.  Really stupid.  How they take talent like fucking Dave and just goodbye. 
[00:20:00]  We don't want to give you a pittance more so you can commute.  Yeah.  He wasn't even asking for a lot of money.  No.  That's terrible.  It's disgusting.  It really does just.  It bugs me.  It's on my top five things that drive me nuts about this place.  Because it's just, you know, on the outside, it's just like, all right, Eastside Dave, we love him.  He's funny.  He should have the job there.  That's just the outside.  If you look deeper, it's a whole fucking testament on this company. 
[00:20:30]  And what they take seriously, how they prioritize things.  If you can't tell that Eastside Dave was a huge commodity to this fucking platform, you're an idiot.  He should have been doing his own show by now.  Yeah.  The problem with SiriusXM, they're not really counting on the future.  I assume they'll just try to sell this to somebody else and have the new people try to figure it out.  Yeah, yeah.  They're all about paying Howard everything, and they don't give a fuck about anyone else. 
[00:21:00]  There's so many really good, talented people that have left this company, and Eastside Dave's a great example of that.  And all he wanted was, what, enough money to be able to commute from South Jersey.  That's all he wanted.  A little bump up.  And they wouldn't give it to him.  That's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  It's sad.  They should just fucking have kept him on and paid him a little more to get to work.  He was here every day, fucking, just the life of the party. 
[00:21:30]  And they just look at that like, oh, yeah, but he's not a celebrity.  We can't fucking give him money.  You gotta be a celebrity, yeah.  Howard Stern and celebrities get taken care of at this place big time.  Everyone else is shit.  But it's too bad.  That's their business model, you know?  Who am I?  Yeah.  I'm just a cog.  But they're not building for any future.  We're all just cogs in the machine.  And then the cog comes out.  The machine don't run as well, but they don't care. 
[00:22:00]  It's still running.  Do you think Scott Greenstein even has any awareness of an Eastside Dave?  Because he's the main guy.  I don't think so.  He's the main guy in programming.  I don't think so.  Programming.  Of course not.  It's a name or a number.  Because he's too busy trying to sign the next dumb celebrity.  To a dumb contract that no one's going to give a fuck about.  Does it get to him?  I don't think so.  Does it get up to him when Dave leaves?  Or does it never even get that far?  Well, yeah.  I don't think it does.  You hope and wish it would.  Because the guys that are in between us and Mr. Greenstein are useless. 
[00:22:30]  What are those guys going to do for Eastside Dave?  Nothing.  No.  Fell through the cracks.  But you're right, Ant.  You know, you see him at his birthday party.  You see his videos at his website.  The guy has a lot of fucking talent.  Well, that's what I'm happy about with Dave.  Is the fact that he pretty much got the boot from here.  Because he wouldn't work for nothing.  They were paying him terrible money.  Yeah.  Paying him nothing.  And then it's good, though, to see him still having fun. 
[00:23:00]  He's still doing a show.  He's got videos going up where he yells and falls down.  I just describe it as the yell and fall down videos of Eastside Dave.  But they're hilarious every time.  And you see the potential there.  Of course.  And he fucks things.  I like fuck things guy.  Fucking stuff.  Fucking stuff.  Hey, he just gets on things around the city and just starts fucking them. 
[00:23:30]  It's hilarious.  But they also know that his kid is sick, right?  It's like, you know, he could have done the right thing.  They're assholes.  I don't even think he wanted more than like $10,000.  Yeah.  It was nothing.  A day, though.  Yeah.  It was really unreasonable.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, Dave, 300 days a year times $10,000.  That's a lot of money.  I just can't do the math.  We're talking around it, but basically, Eastside Dave was a huge part of Ron and Fez, and he  couldn't afford to commute anymore, so he went to the bosses, quote bosses, and asked 
[00:24:00]  for a bump up just so he could afford to come in and do the Ron and Fez show.  That was it.  It was costing him money to come here.  And they said no to that.  They said no to that.  Wow.  Jesus.  Jack Jesus.  It's just amazing to me.  Well, it's what this company is.  That's what they are.  It's my top five things that drive me nuts.  The other one is the Bruce Springsteen Roland picture, believe it or not.  Oh, really? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, that's on my top five.  That's driving you nuts?  That's on my top five.  Yeah.  The fact that Roland was a mere 10 feet away from his fucking hero, and the company would  not allow him to get a picture.  Now, why is that?  They'll tell you all sorts of weird things, but in the end, you're the company.  All you had to do was go, Roland, get online with the listeners, and here it is.  Finally, you get your picture with your hero, Bruce Springsteen.  Bruce.  Bruce.  And we're doing this because we really just like you and appreciate what you're doing 
[00:25:00]  for Sirius XM.  Really?  And they would not allow him to do that.  That's beyond me.  And it's not a throwaway thing for Roland.  That's like...  That is beyond me.  That's all Roland wants before he dies, is a picture with Bruce Springsteen.  That's all he wants.  And he was that fucking close, and the company said no.  That's the other thing that drives me nuts on a regular basis, that that never happened.  So Dave and Roland, top two.  Yeah, the others I'd have to think about.  I'll give you the other three in the coming weeks. 
[00:25:30]  No problem.  No problem.  Jimmy?  Yes?  Congratulations to your Cowboys.  Yeah.  Because I know eventually you're going to be a Cowboys fan again.  If they start doing good, I'll root for them in the playoffs.  I'm not believing that you're not a Cowboys fan anymore.  I don't hate the Cowboys.  I could never dislike them.  I'm just so tired of Romo, as far as I'm concerned, being a bum.  Like, I don't care that he was a 44-7 or a Buffalo.  So what?  He stinks in the playoffs.  Oh, okay.  He stinks when it counts.  Well, the so what? 
[00:26:00]  I mean, the Bills, you know, everyone's thinking they have a pretty good team this year,  and the Cowboys dismantled them.  People are saying Romo was healthy for the first time in a while.  He threw for 270 yards.  That's cool.  He threw for the TDs.  Apparently, he's never healthy in the postseason.  He's never healthy during big games.  And now your Cowboys have the same record as my Jets, 5-4.  How about, who's the number, NFC East, who's, how's the Giants and Redskins in Philly?  I haven't paid attention.  The Giants lost to the, um. 
[00:26:30]  Niners, right?  Yeah, the Niners.  Niners are looking fucking good.  I saw some of that when I was stepping up on the Stairmaster.  Ooh.  Getting these buns in shape.  Buns.  I want to be able to grip your finger and rip it off.  No, the 49ers are for real this year.  Absolutely for fucking real this year, man.  And what's the Giants record, Sam?  If you could stop looking at photos of the men in their uniforms.  Giants are 6-3, Jimmy. 
[00:27:00]  Okay.  And they lost to the Niners 27-20.  And how about the, uh...  And the Giants are just one game ahead of the Cowboys at this point, so...  What are the Skins, 5-4-2?  Skins?  I don't know.  Now we're going at the territory that I don't know.  Travis, you've waltzed in.  Skins are 3-6.  They're in last place.  Okay.  Ooh.  We call them the Skins, right?  I usually would call them the Red Skins, but I just said Skins because I'm too tired.  Call them the Savage Engines.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about the Gulls? 
[00:27:30]  The Gulls?  Eagles.  Yeah, I know.  The Gulls.  Kind of shorten it up, make it cool.  Yeah, yeah.  How about the Oys?  They're 3-6 as well.  I think that's going to take off.  I think so.  The Gulls.  Yeah, I think people are going to say, hey, did you see the Gulls game?  Yeah.  How about the Ours?  Oh, they beat the Ants.  No.  It's cool.  It's how cool guys talk.  Yeah.  Is it?  It's a new thing.  I missed that.  Yeah.  Eagles are not happening this year.  3-6.  Terrible.  No, the Phil Gulls are not doing good.  You've got to put the city first. 
[00:28:00]  Phil Gulls.  I'll tell you who's happening.  The Minvikes?  What the hell?  There you go.  There you go.  What happened?  I've got to hear that again.  He broke the tire.  Wait, did he fall backwards?  No, he fell straight down.  How is that possible?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  I wish Larry King or Chaz Bono was in that chair.  Oh, shit.  Oh, is that happening today?  No, it's tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God. 
[00:28:30]  We're all on stools, basically.  We're pretty high off the ground, and Travis just fell straight to earth.  I wish there was a video of that.  I know.  That's hilarious.  Can we hear that again?  How did that break without falling over backwards or sideways?  Nice job, fatso.  Yeah, this is going to give me a complex.  Wow.  If that happened, I would fucking sue this company.  No problem.  The only way I'm getting more money.  Did it break?  The chair in that room must be ready to pan-take.  Sorry. 
[00:29:00]  Do we have that?  Yes.  Okay.  Got to hear this.  I'll tell you who's happening.  The Minvikes?  You yelled, oh, no.  You went, oh, no.  Did you really?  Yeah, listen to it.  Play it again.  Listen, you'll hear him go.  I didn't hear the oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's way in the background.  I'll tell you who's happening. 
[00:29:30]  The Minvikes?  oh no oh no what the fuck that's fucking hilarious oh god it was just and that's the  celebrity seat man oh yeah that could have been like jimmy said chas bono's gonna be in  maybe no no that's yeah oh he is let's stop at the he i'll say uh chas it's nice to meet you  i'm not fucking saying he or she or any of that yeah yeah tomorrow after uh after larry larry 
[00:30:00]  let's go we get larry king in again huh yeah yeah get my seat that uh doesn't break though that guy  that guy's bones would have shattered oh my god larry's head was in that seat like mr glass  he would have just fucking he would have thought we were making fun of him or chas would have thought  it was a goof that we set up oh my god larry wouldn't have got back up i don't think no not  looks a bit brittle these days yeah that would imagine that happens and then like a week later  larry died and they blame it on the fall oh oh exactly we're getting like awards oh no no the 
[00:30:30]  guy that's happening this year is tim tebow oh boy people just is he great oh my god he sucks  but what is he three and one as a starter win he's three and one he's three and one as a starter  two passes yesterday and he's three and one two passes you gotta focus on tim tebow and i know  you're not the biggest football fan but it's driving the entire league fucking nuts gotta be you know 
[00:31:00]  you had two completions you talk all the time about like here's proof that god doesn't exist here's  proof that god does exist right because he sucks and he's a huge you know god guy and he keeps finding  this his first year with the with the denkos  i hate your team the denkos  they beat uh the kansas city chiefs oh man i just saw tebow throw for a touchdown though  yeah yeah and that was it that was his second pass no that was two of two he was two well no he was 
[00:31:30]  two for eight no that's impossible in the nfl yeah he was two for eight they completely understand  how crazy that is yeah it's crazy he was two for eight so so he was making believe he's back at  college yeah apparently i mean he he ran in for a touchdown and he tossed you know i think it was  like a 54 yard touchdown in the fourth quarter right but you can't win a super bowl that way i don't 
[00:32:00]  think they're looking to win a super bowl i think they're just looking to finish the year and figure  out what to do next what's their record now uh they're they're actually they're tebow's three  and one as a starter that's just crazy uh denver is uh denkos yeah four and five he threw two he  completed two passes for 69 total yards and and they won yeah that's just nuts he didn't complete a  pass until the third quarter they barely even try i don't know if denver's out of their mind or if 
[00:32:30]  they're brilliant because they're they're basically admitting like we don't have a passing game so  let's just run until they can't stop it anymore but teams are going to catch on to that yeah but  you're gonna you're gonna wear them down eventually yeah you got a good line you never know good running  game and uh but all right but you got to put the ball in the air at some point yeah i just like  saying things you're right you're not wrong yeah look what happens you're not wrong i'm not gonna  disagree that's a big sports talk thing yeah well you know you're not disagreeing no i'm not gonna 
[00:33:00]  say you're 100 wrong they just they won't they like to have as many words as possible they won't  just go you're right well i'm not gonna say you're wrong i'm not gonna disagree what do you agree or not  yeah what the fuck i didn't ask you what you're not gonna do you're also not gonna go to the moon  in a rocket ship asshole a million things you're not gonna do how do you feel about this  they're gonna break tebow though yeah if he runs that much well i mean he's not the only guy that's 
[00:33:30]  running he's he's running he ran he ran for a touchdown he's running i mean good for him i guess  he's winning games who'd they beat kansas city chiefs uh 17 10 and then uh i've been avoiding  no it's the chiefs because there's a can't see chiefs  and the stupid jets lost to the uh the pats that was the biggest game the nats beat the nets 
[00:34:00]  that was the biggest game of the weekend oh yeah well like i was saying uh uh what are the odds  the patriots are gonna drop three like that i guess hey i'm not gonna disagree  i mean look they left it all on the field yeah yeah they destroyed him 37 16 what was the jets  record in the beginning of the year were they four and oh in the beginning of the year they were oh no  no no i mean i should that's a that's a that's an excellent distinction you just made after the  chair just fucking was split by your big fat asshole oh no what uh hey chair breaker that's something 
[00:34:30]  you would have called them if we were both five hey chair breaker what is uh what were they were  they four at one point or three and three no no they uh or no well then they lost the three in a  row weren't they really good at one point like they well i mean they're always you know i'm trying  to figure this out now i forget because they lost um they lost three in a row now they've well now  they lost to the pats but then you know we'd have to go back in time now they're still in it they're 
[00:35:00]  always in it yeah they started disagree they start off well then they lost three in a row  then they won a couple in a row and now they won their first two and then something like that  right three in a row yeah yeah so fucking sanchez drives us nuts couldn't get it done fuck he can't  get it done he was i couldn't close the deal no he couldn't no no well the jets brag about their  defense and and well when you have 37 16 and then on top of that sanchez gets sacked five times

[00:38:30]  who goes to this fucking movie 26 mil is that is that uh it's decent yeah is that good it's number  two i mean immortals beat it but immortals was like a big epic you know thing does it do i see  three percent on rotten tomato three well that's up from zero so it's actually who's the asshole that  had to give it a positive review to be different the adam s right exactly look you can't even find it  you can't even find the tomato there's the tomato okay i bet that could be the bad review it could 
[00:39:00]  be the only uh positive review for this movie uh it's from media mics and it's written by mike  michael a smith oh he's good michael smith is pretty big what does it say the premise gets annoying  after a while but that is when pacino shows up to make things interesting oh stop he gets great  laugh spoof spoofing his serious side while on stage and when his oscar is accidentally damaged  zings the academy awards is that a positive review yeah yeah it doesn't sound very positive and it has 
[00:39:30]  151 comments attached to it so you can tell that people aren't really enjoying his positive review  yeah that's the single positive review jesus a lot of people went and saw it though man they thought  that trail that trailer looked good oh my god i gotta see this fucking thing the people  the audience give it a 54 percent liked it rating dude the audience just because you pay for something 
[00:40:00]  you don't you shouldn't you feel obligated to say it was good well why don't you go see it before  judging it 54 look at that 54 percent of the people thought it was a good movie yeah yeah they  polled the the people as they leave the theater right no well i cannot believe more than half of  the people average rating good but anyone going to see that likes what adam sandler does like they're  fans so they're gonna be more so if you want to be if you want to be part of the one percent you got 
[00:40:30]  to start by being honest and realizing that that adam sandler movie sucks a fucking dick and you should  tell the world yeah start there awfulness right yes michael moore has a nice mansion huh oh that's  great hilarious he's got a big old two million dollar mansion in michigan on a lake in michigan  beautiful on a lake and he and and he's he all he's been doing this weekend is hawking his wares 
[00:41:00]  his book and his fucking website and everything else as the the occupy movement just crumbles it's  an exclusive lake in michigan and he's got one of the mansions uh with like big time celebrities  and movie stars and and he's got a spread on that lake man wow we oh yeah and good for him hey but  but if you're gonna show up at these occupies you know look at that house you you should be donating  a shitload of money to the cause at the very least that's a big fucking house man look at that  fuck that looks nice how much that cost two million that's it that's it that's in michigan 
[00:41:30]  that's why we gotta leave i gotta get the fuck out of here i could have i could have literally have  a castle let's go find castles i want a castle in england i'm gonna go to england and buy a castle  old castle yeah that'd be cool yeah my god two million bucks for that wait how is occupy falling  apart well you got sexual assault in philly right uh portland they're shutting it down 
[00:42:00]  because of drug overdoses um yeah yeah yeah they uh they need to move on to the next level whatever  it is whatever it is are they actually shutting them down or just breaking them up in portland  they certainly shut it down they said fuck this we're done with it yeah was there riots no a couple  drug overdoses drug ods people dying no but i mean after that like when they were shutting it down  with the riots or no not in portland no no i just read the headline a couple of cops were assaulted 
[00:42:30]  too in uh san francisco yeah some some bitch fucking leaned over uh with a razor and cut one of the  cops on the hand right and then another guy uh went to grab one of the cops radio and flung him on the  ground by his uniform and shit yeah did they get the razor chick no she ran off yeah she was in a  crowd she just stuck her arm out went cut the cop across his hand with a razor and they have no video  of her i know this movement's in trouble they got to figure out what's not a movement well they got 
[00:43:00]  to figure out what's next if there is something that's next they got to move on to that stage  i think what they uh want to do is figure out how to organize for the spring but here's the deal  if they break this up during the winter any city that allows us to get another foothold in spring  will be fucking retarded right i agree with you cannot fucking let this the group get another  foothold if if you're able to you know crush this crush the rebellion because it's uh it's now just a 
[00:43:30]  filth fest dirty fleas they got fucking zuccotti lung zuccotti lung and fleas yeah there's some  fleas jumping around down there disgusting fucking but michael moore's got that nice mansion on the  water yeah why don't you invite a few people there occupy michael moore's house i don't know i think  i think you're if you're supporting the occupy movement you gotta do more than just show up 
[00:44:00]  that's all he talking on a bullhorn opie he's bringing recognition to it and that's all he  needs to do yeah right yeah right yeah um yeah we've been we've been i guess lucky for the warm  weather we've had here but unlucky as far as these idiots go because i really want to see  what a whole week of that bitter cold fucking windy shit will bring it's gonna be 65 degrees today  you know so it's a party over there well the type of people i'll say it again that i've seen 
[00:44:30]  at zuccotti park they'll hang for the winter not a lot of them the numbers are gonna dwindle but  there's enough that they'll be able to keep that park i think you're gonna get the professional  homeless that just you know are in that weather anyway if there's some fucking dopey kid in their  freezing their balls off or their tits off a lot of the dopey kids have left yeah that's what i mean  you know so it's what is it homeless people that's all that's left you got hardened looking

[00:46:30]  at this point so now they're like hey we better you know go somewhere where the cops can look like  fucking fascists because they realize that they're functioning but they're not stopping anything no  everything business they're occupying a park but yeah it's annoying but nobody gives a fuck because  business as usual is continuing yeah it's like you're not stopping anything well there's a counter  protest as well today by the business owners oh yeah they're a little pissed off they're pissed off  they have absolutely lost business down there i guess i yeah i didn't think so when i went down

[00:55:30]  go johnny go go go  go johnny go go  go johnny go go  go johnny go go go  johnny go go  he used to carry his guitar  getting topical  hold up  wait a minute  with the sex man  wow  topical with the sex man  i don't know what's going on today  oh i know what this one is 
[00:56:00]  you do  but of course it's the sex man segment  so yeah i uh  i leave it to the sex man  good morning  well michael j fox performed johnny be good at his annual parkinson's charity fundraiser  oh  and he  well  did he play the guitar  yes he did  there's video of it  he played the guitar  that's good i'd hate to see johnny when he'd be bad  yeah  there's video of this  oh i would like to see that 
[00:56:30]  tell you the truth  he played the same type of guitar  there he is  video  come on where's the video  here we go  if he doesn't turn this a little bit  i'm going to kiss his lips  turn that up  oh he's not singing 
[00:57:00]  who's holding the camera michael j fox  fox  you can keep it together when he's playing the guitar  his head is  i guess it helps  down to the left like  like he  yeah it looks very  i feel bad for him  but he always used to do that with his head right  nah  it's a thing he's doing since parkinson's  he's doing it more but  he always was weird with his head when he was acting  i love the fact that he's uh 
[00:57:30]  been really public  and he's not ashamed  he's just so fucking terrible for him  curb your enthusiasm  he  he  uh  did an episode where he made fun of himself  did he  oh fuck yeah man  curb was great this year  i loved it  you see all the episodes in  no  i saw two and i liked them both  i have not  you saw a few of them  i saw a few  not all of them though  you bailed  yeah  eh  i'm kind of a taker to leave it on that show  you know  i am too  yeah  some of them are funny 
[00:58:00]  some of them a little  weirdly over the top  kind of thing going on  what i didn't like about it  it's it's like the writing is brilliant  but there was a couple times where it seems like they were doing scenes  just to get a certain monologue out there  like like let's do a scene where we could talk about  why you shouldn't eat strawberry ice cream on a jewish holiday  i'm making that up  but like  but again i guess  that's kind of nitpicking  because some of the stuff is so fucking funny  that palestinian chickens episode  oh that was great  and i'm not a fan of the show was brilliant  that was great  he's fucking  he's a funny dude man 
[00:58:30]  problem is like  who would hang out with larry david after a while  so it takes me out of the show  like it's not believable anymore  he's an awful dude  no one would hang out with this guy  there's nothing endearing about him  but what  it's amazing like  the guy can  writing is hard  to structure an episode  yeah  is fucking hard man  and for him to  for year after year  year after year  all through seinfeld  and through these  to be able to  brilliantly fucking structure  these uh  these b stories 
[00:59:00]  and these like  the the main story  yeah  it's  that's a talent  what a fucking talent that is man  i just stole your word  but to get them to tie in so well  is  i'm speechless  i could never do that  yeah  all right  you want to hear from dice francesa today  what  oh jeez  sure  this new guy  what  and the other guy  i see he's tweeting  i saw that too  but is that the guy  i think  someone might be stealing his thunder 
[00:59:30]  no i think it's the guy  i saw the tweets  if it's the guy  i don't want him pigeonholing himself  into being the racist guy  no he's funny  he's just a sports guy  he could throw a little racism in there  that's fine  we don't mind that  but don't make it a racist francesa  yeah  because the impression  the impression is too good  yeah  there's other way  to pigeonhole that show  uh  dice francesa  what's up  from the studios  of serious xm satellite radio  simulcast nowhere  it's the open anthony program  pardon me  i have a donut stuck in my throat here

[01:05:00]  with what  for my awful joke  because i said you'd hate to see him when he be bad  and some guy goes  you'd hate to see johnny when he be bad  you should have your skull caved in with a magic eight ball  that'd do it  there's a retweet  he's right  uh  sal  isolated  travis fallen  oh  right right because uh  we uh you heard all the microphones  i've never seen this before but uh 
[01:05:30]  travis's  chair fell to the fucking earth  straight down  straight down he fell on the floor  and uh that's the seat that larry king would be in tomorrow  oh boy  imagine if that happened to larry  oh boy  holy shit  his foot would roll off  this is how it sounded with the isolated mic  oh no  oh no  oh no  oh no  oh no  you put a girl thing to yell  a bunch of people on twitter pointed out that we didn't even ask travis if he was okay 
[01:06:00]  i didn't even think  no we just started laughing  and said let's hear that again  he could have spinal injuries we don't care  yeah  just want to hear it again  i uh  i went to uh  i went to uh the old best buy yesterday  yeah  i gotta tell you  what a collection of fucking idiots  why  over there at the best buy  that's all we got left  is the best buy  and apparently they know that  because it's just uh  what were you looking for  it's always  i wanted to get a uh a small uh windows computer to play uh games on computer games 
[01:06:30]  because uh i do have the xbox which is wonderful i've been playing uh modern warfare on it  do you like it  yes i like it  yes i like it  i i got the uh the zim 3  it's xim 3  if you hate the uh console controllers and want to use mouse and keyboard  get the zim 3  it's amazing  you like the key  wait wait let me ask you i don't  mouse and keyboard  when you use mouse and keyboard is that like you you just  oh  you go like this you're going 
[01:07:00]  well why are you hitting like  over the side over the side over this way  you move your guy with with this with these  you move your guy you can move your guy with your left finger on the keyboard  yeah and then you spin them around and aim with your mouse  how the fuck is that easier than a key  it's so easy it just becomes second nature  it's just what you're used to i think ant  no you know what it is too  you gotta have both sides of your brain working  your left hand and your right hand  it's good but you got it on the controller also  if you think about it  but the thing is  you can get so much more detailed control with a mouse 
[01:07:30]  if you looked up  and i've said this before  if you look up an xbox controller to your computer  and try to get the mouse icon onto a  onto a link to click  you'd be sitting there trying to line it up  but a mouse you just instantly  you're right on it you click  that's how it is with targeting with a mouse  it's just easier with a mouse and keyboard  what does zim allow you to do  play these with the keyboard and mouse  yeah you could plug a keyboard and mouse into your xbox  and adjust it  you could program all the keys 
[01:08:00]  you could adjust the sensitivity of the mouse  and reallocate the keys to what you want them to do  it's just  it's everything  that a pc gamer would want  if they're playing on xbox  there's no delay  everyone's like  oh those things suck  because it skips  and there's no  there's a delay  there's no delay  it works just as good as a fucking pc  and your gaming got much better  since you switched over  yeah yeah  i'm still getting used to the game itself  so you know  even though i'm moving well  i can move well right in front of somebody with a shotgun 
[01:08:30]  how are the graphics  and they plow my face in  good  really good  is it an upgrade for the last game  it's about the same  about the same  about the same  it's different maps  a couple of different weapons  yeah  yeah and it's just  that's just amazing  that's in game right  yeah  where's modern warfare  can we see the one ant's playing  yeah i think that was  that was it  modern warfare is great  but uh i i decided  uh a lot of people said  anthony  why are you playing that child's game  modern warfare  on the xbox 
[01:09:00]  you're a little pussy  uh why don't you get  battlefield 3  now i was uh looking at battlefield 3  i've been a fan of all the battlefield games  i like battlefield uh 1942  it was great  it was like a old world war 2 thing  you get to fly uh  some of the planes  you grab the joystick  and just  fucking  tear it  well i i pick it up  but you know i need a computer  i need the whole thing  i pretty much bought  a computer dedicated to video games  and battlefield's not on xbox i'm assuming 
[01:09:30]  it is  it is  but i i was hearing from my uh pc gamers  it's like no you could play it on this  if you're gonna play it you wanna play it on a pc  play pc  it's great  and and and i'm thinking you know  i don't wanna try to fly some of the aircraft in the game  using that dumb fucking controller  and the zim i can't use a joystick with it yet  so i figured i'd get the pc game  so i go to best buy  i pick up a pc  i pick up the game  i pick up keyboards  and fucking whatever i need  to play the game  and uh 
[01:10:00]  i get home  and the computer doesn't even start  doesn't even work  why  and i don't know  the the back by the fan  it had a distinct smell of a power unit  that kind of took a shit  the one you just bought  yeah yeah  so uh  so i'm going back to um  to best buy with it  i go back  i go to the customer service thing  i hand him the receipt  i'm like okay  he goes oh you're gonna get another one  i was like yeah  i'll pick out a whole nother computer  one that's a little more expensive  and shit like that  so he goes okay  just come back here when you're done  i go okay  sounds easy 
[01:10:30]  yeah i did it  i picked one out  there's always a problem though  i'm i'm yeah  i'm waiting for the problem  i go back  now the guy that told me that  he's not there anymore  how would he be  he's not there anymore  now there's some other guy there  he goes okay  just stand on line here  i went and i look at the line  is now fucking huge  and it's customer service line  this isn't just ringing shit up  these are people with problems  you know how slowly that fucking line goes  and i go i waited on line already  i go i i was told to bring this up here  and i exchange it  i already did my waiting on line time 
[01:11:00]  no you gotta wait on the line  right on the line  so i'm just standing there  eyeball fucking this guy  i'm just fucking looking  i'm like you prick  and everybody that walked up to customer service to have something done  there was a problem  and i would i was i was this guy  oh  oh  oh  oh look that  yeah that's good  what are you paying in drachma  what what happened  would you bring that back after 10 years  it's just people  you actually got in the line  are so annoying 
[01:11:30]  yeah but i kept looking at it  and then the guy original guy came back  did he notice you  yeah he's like  alright come here  so you were right the whole fucking time  yes  jesus  but douchebaggy new guy  right  like thought i was fucking trying to  power trip guy  pull the wool over his eyes as they say  and uh  completed that transaction  went home  hooked everything up  and uh  i start playing the game  battlefield 3  sucks  asshole  i went through all the trouble  because i i'm hearing everybody  uh  say how great it is 
[01:12:00]  uh  modern warfare it is  it's not  it's buggy as fuck  first thing i do  i get on  and nothing works  i'm hitting the thing  my gun won't fire  so uh  so i i i kind of fixed that  how'd you fix that  i threw a new mouse on it  wasn't identifying some shit  and then  it wouldn't stop firing  ugh  like right when i would spawn  my my fucking gun just does going  grrrr  i'm just shooting at nothing  that's helpful  yeah real helpful  and that's a bug 
[01:12:30]  in the system  so i had a  i had to weed that out by  by  taking all the settings off of the joystick  it just was a pain in the ass  like i just wanna  when i play a game  i just wanna play a game  it took literally  an hour and a half to load the game  oh fuck that  and they use some kind of an interface  called uh  what is it  oasis or  i don't i'm not even sure what it is  it's it sucks so bad  to go to a multiplayer board  what is an interface  origin that's it  i'm sorry origin 
[01:13:00]  it's like if you if i want to play multiplayer  you hit multiplayer on the game  and it takes you to a lobby area  where you can choose what  what game you want to play  and uh  it puts you on a team  and shit like that  this is web based  it's like a browser comes up in the game  i don't want a browser to come up  browser to come up  i want gamey shit to come up  and then uh  you click on it  you get put in some game  it's it's  there's really no  why are they so behind  sounds like that's some shit 
[01:13:30]  they should have figured out  this origin interface  is supposed to be like steam was  for another gaming system  and and it doesn't work well  the games buggy  uh the the levels are huge  and you wind up wandering around  doing nothing  until you get killed  uh it was fun driving a tank  but you know  but you're back to modern warfare already  yeah i i i i got a bell  battlefield uh  three at least for the um  for the pc it sucks 
[01:14:00]  and i can't see it being good for the xbox  because how are you going to fly those planes  with a controller  you need a legitimate joystick  with the throttle  with the uh  where you're able to spin the the joystick  left and right for rudders and shit  like it's just easier to to be good with a plane when you have a joystick  this is pretty cool by the way  oh this game is  i'm watching the modern warfare on youtube  this is pretty fucking cool stuff  modern warfare is great man  they're just going to all these like places  yeah  just going to all these places  could you just hang out in there if you wanted to 
[01:14:30]  oh someone will get you eventually  i love how jimmy just explains video games  someone will get you eventually  you get to go in all these little places  but if you like open that door  yeah  and went under there and just fucking relaxed  you could do that  you could do that  let's say you had to shit  anthony had to shit  could you just put your guy behind a fucking  the gun depot here or something  i've done that before  and uh  and uh  i've come back and the guy's been fine  i've come back and you know  the guy was dead  how would they find the man there  if he just fucking hanging out  turn the lights off  just wandering around  people  who's wandering down there 
[01:15:00]  people also look down there  what made you go down there  that makes the other people go down there  alright what do you  you think you're special  then they'll just see you sitting there  not even pointing the gun at him  and be like oh  then you could really kill him well  you're just frozen in the game  take the shotgun right to the back of his head  have you ever seen one like that  oh yeah  i've come up on people that must have been taking a piss or something  and their character is just kind of standing there  and you walk up and just put the gun right next to his face  and BOOM  this should be a fucking thing where like you have a five minute like shit button 
[01:15:30]  shit button  but while  it has to humiliate your character  like while you're gone your character has to stand there  and just sing mini the moocher  that's really embarrassing  shit break time  yeah  oh he's taking a shit  how do you know  i don't know his character is going  cha cha cha  cha cha  cha cha  but i was getting much better at aiming  and at killing and having kill streaks 
[01:16:00]  what's that blood streak mean on the thing  that means the guy is getting hit somewhere  that means the character that's uh your character is taking some damage  it faded away though he's good  yeah now he's good to go  that's fucking good  he's running a mini gun there  could you go to those mountains back there if you wanted to or no  i think uh i think that's uh you probably hit a barrier at some point  oh you did  just down that helicopter  that was a good one  what happens if you hit a barrier  uh you can't go past it  but i mean like is it like a physical barrier  or you just keep walking  yeah yeah you just can't move  it's uh you know like a roadblock and or boulders are in the road 
[01:16:30]  they they do some pretty interesting things to keep you in the game  oh that guy's chewing up people with his mini gun  although it's so easy to just fucking get hit in that game  in modern  yeah it just happens all the time  if if and if i'm fucking if i'm sitting somewhere  camping a doorway  waiting for somebody to come in  i will always get shot in the back  i'll always be facing the wrong direction  and if i'm camping on a doorway  waiting for someone to come in 
[01:17:00]  i will always  move to look behind me for a second  right and the second i do that  that's when someone comes in the door and shoots me  can't you have just a little mirror on your gun  so you can  that'd be nice  see what's behind you  yeah like when you're biking  you got a little fucking mirror  yeah  why not  some behind me shit  hey is there anyone in those helicopters are shooting down  yeah  oh there is  yeah  so there's some other guy playing that  going like oh fuck  yeah  where do you see the helicopter view  they have them uh  if you  if you get a helicopter 
[01:17:30]  you're able to uh target the ground  and launch  you can get predator drones  and launch missiles into a group of people  and take out like a shitload of uh  the opposition  could we see on youtube what it looks like from the helicopter  oh  that's when you get enough kills  if you get like a bunch of kills in a row  you can get a helicopter  you can get um  predator drones  you can get bombers  a plane  yeah yeah  and but the but it's not like we  it turns into a flight simulator or anything 
[01:18:00]  you're just in charge of what the plane's doing  oh  and you can kind of  just drop a shitload of bombs on it  well that's why i was liking battlefield 3  the idea of it  because i i used to like battlefield 1942  uh  two you'd fly the plane around  and be able to uh  go on bombing runs  and and fly upside down  and do loops  and fucking  nothing was better than  than turning with your wingtips  scraping on the ground  as you're just strafing people  look at that they're in the helicopter  what what if you uh  what if you  yeah see now it takes off  what's a really good 
[01:18:30]  that's fucking pretty cool man  and now  he's just driving it  fly it asshole  yeah you could  he's keeping pretty low  yeah it's not a saturn  how the fuck did they figure this shit out  dude it's all ones and zeros  i don't know  in the end it's ones and zeros right  i don't know what that means  jesus  i don't know what ones and zeros means  that's just on or off  things are on or off  what do you mean  whether it's a color  whether whether it's a movement  whether it's  something you do  that makes something go on and off  it's just on and off  what is a one or a zero  i don't know what that means 
[01:19:00]  everything's one or zero  and i don't know how to start  and a combination of the ones and the zeros  but like what is a one  one means on  means  the circuit is closed  the transistor  on that little circuit board  with millions and millions of transistors on it  is now closed  and current can  go through that  that circuit  and that current going through that circuit  tells something what to do  like one pixel  turns red  and then another one tells that pixel to move over 
[01:19:30]  some one spot  and then  a zero  tells it to go away  it's just fucked up  it's amazing  ones and zero  okay but they're all little circuits  and what are they letting light through  no electricity  and it  and it  and it informs the computer  um  what to  to put out  it's it's  it's very hard to explain  i'm not doing a good job at all  i wish somebody knew  because i'm i i  it's the most basic 
[01:20:00]  thing and i i don't get it  you might  might have to go back to school  they teach that shit  yeah  you want to take a course maybe  i should have a funny sitcom  the older guy that goes back to school  none of the kids understand me  i started grammar school  anthony uh  it's an ea game that battlefield earth huh  yes  yeah  uh i agree with maddie  he says they've been known for not giving a shit with their games  yep  i'll go back to battlefield 1942  because i got my joystick  i had a pisser with that game  yeah  flying a fucking corsair old world war ii corsair 
[01:20:30]  and just uh coming into a japanese village  and then you just fucking  nail him  drop some bombs  pull out  and then dog fighting  and and shit like that  like you'll  you'll you'll start seeing shots wing past your canopy  and you're like whoa  heavy turn  or you come up and pull a fucking  rad immelman move or something  and then but  before you know it you're behind the guy chewing him up  right  you get really good  i got so good with those planes it was so much fun  and i was expecting that with battlefield 3  and it sucked ass 
[01:21:00]  yes  larry's gonna explain uh the ones and zeros to jimmy  oh  i want to hear this  larry in oklahoma  oklahoma  hi boys  hi larry  uh jim  yes sir  uh is  jim are you familiar with base 10 numbering  oh my god  i have no idea  i just threw them off  what does that mean  base 10 is the numbering system that you are familiar with  you have 10 separate distinct digits 0 through 9  yes ok  ok 
[01:21:30]  the ones and zeros is base 2 numbering you have two digits a 1 and a 0  ok  the 0 is 0 the 1 is 1  to represent the actual number 2 the number in base 2 numbering is 1 0  and 3 is 1 1  so you only use two digits because an electronic state through a gate is either on or it's off in the electronics business  right  so that's why it's all ones and zeros and you represent the numbers two digits 1 and 0 
[01:22:00]  but what was let me ask you ok  what was the number 3  like why would you put a number 3 somewhere like a 1 and a 0 for a 2 or a 1 1 1 for a 3 whoever it is  why would you do that what would that tell the computer  well it would tell the computer you're trying to represent an analog number 3 because in base 10 when you get to the number for 10 you have to restart restart  reusing your 10 discrete digits so 10 is represented with a 1 and a 0  so in base 2 when you get to the actual number what we think of is 2 you have to start reusing your digits so the base 10 equivalent in digit in base 2 numbering 
[01:22:30]  and then 1 is 0 and then 3 is 1 1  listen to this guy  he sounds like he's explaining it perfectly  of course he is to people that know  he's dumbing it down but my brain exploded about 30 seconds  but how does it like if there's a bunch of ones and a couple zeros how does the computer know if that should be a fucking 
[01:23:00]  if i'm starting a picture of a tit or if i need red because i'm making a sign how does it know  well that's a part of the function of the software the software interprets the ones and zeros  i mean all the software is is just a single two digits a one and zero because the gate can be on or it's off  and then you represent everything in the computer based on what how the software interprets the the electronic states whether it's a one or a zero  because it's really simple in a computer because zero is no voltage and one is whatever if it's a 3 volt supply that the semiconductors are now down 
[01:23:30]  and now down instead of the the old old days of ttl the 5 volt it's down  yeah right  two volts so it's so two volts is a one and zero is no volts  because the gate is on or it's off and you represent it all it with base 2 numbering  i mean i didn't even start getting into octal early computers weren't octal and i use computers that use binary coded x a decimal  this guy  are you a computer 
[01:24:00]  are you a computer programmer  no sir i'm a truck driver  but you just uh...  i don't mean to laugh  why aren't you in the business  because i make more money driving a truck than i do when i was an intelligent analyst the linguist uh... computer programmer computer repair  i could fix radios computers there's no money in it  wow that's a shame man  do hackers the hackers understand the one zero stuff right  you think  well yeah like anthony having so much trouble with the game he doesn't realize as soon as those kids get the game 
[01:24:30]  they deconstructed and create cheat codes that's why you can't kill them  you can't kill a guy  i mean for i would say it's literally as soon as the game is at their house they're constructing cheat codes to make their guys invincible  to make sure no matter what he points in the direction  you know the reticle immediately starts glomming on the objects to get hit every time  yeah that's uh... i've noticed some people i've shot them three times square in the chest with a barrett 50 cal  and they just uh... open fire on me 
[01:25:00]  but can i ask you something you bring the xbox game home  how do you uh... develop the cheat codes and add it to your game i never understood that  well you have a separate pc with uh... you they deconstructed an xbox so that they've interfaced their xbox with their pc and then they download the game  but how do you connect the two  you gotta dumb this down for me but how do you connect the two you got the xbox gaming system you got your computer  you're working on the cheat codes and now how do you combine the two  well the xbox is a computer itself 
[01:25:30]  agreed  and all you have to do is construct an interface between your pc with a keyboard and a screen  or they've altered their xbox into a computer with a keyboard so they can actually get inside the codes of the xbox to understand how the xbox works  now i i personally don't know what microprocessor the xbox uses  but i gotta assume it's a microsoft it's windows based so  so that if anybody with a windows computer if they can get into the xbox and the hackers do that  as soon as they come home they plug it in they get into the 
[01:26:00]  you know they they download the cartridge or the dvd or whatever it is  because it's probably not cartridge i'm dating myself  but uh... you know they just download the dvd and start deconstructing the code  how do they know... let me ask you something  and this is a basic hacker question  how do they know when they download it  like when you look at code it's a bunch of numbers and shit  how do they know all right that one makes the left leg go  i just don't get how do you fucking look at that and make sense of it  well there's guys that do understand the ones and zeros  that's how i wrote software i wrote in ones and zeros 
[01:26:30]  but i was very familiar with the computer  i there wasn't anything about that computer i didn't know i understood the hardware i understood the software  there wasn't anything i didn't know and i wrote everything in ones and zeros  because i understand how the computer actually function  how the kit like like the guys that write the operating systems have an intimate understanding of how the computer works  ones and zeros is normal to them  most guys they just look through an interpreter  i mean it all is done in some kind of a language  whether they're using c or they're using c plus plus or whether in the windows system 
[01:27:00]  they're not actually looking at the ones and zeros  they're looking at the ones and zeros  representing it  but the guys that write the operating systems they understand the ones and zeros  and uh... actually are into are intimately familiar with how the computer work  intimate  well you have to because you have to manipulate the stack yourself  you don't have an operating system to take care of all that for you the pointers  this guy is like a super nerd  i don't know what that means to manipulate the stack  well the stack is where the computer stores things 
[01:27:30]  it stores things on the stacks  you have to know where the pointer is  wait is that like my boot record?  yeah  that's all i know is my boot record  well the computer  well if you're going back to a DOS based system  which is what you're talking about  if you're talking about a boot record  uh... the computer uses a  the as an architecture  the microprocessor itself  the architect  the actual computer has an architecture  and you understand the architecture  what happens  who is the one? 
[01:28:00]  the operating system takes care of  neo  can hackers  let me ask you  can hackers when they steal software  can they make it so the software doesn't report them?  yes of course  because the software reports you and tells on you right?  it tells on you  yeah but what you do is  you either clone a legal user  or you  you tell the computer  you tell the software not to report  because if you download it  and then immediately sever your connection online  then there's no place for it to report 
[01:28:30]  of course  the whopper  the whopper finds out though  hey we got another egghead that wants in on this  oh hello sir  Dan in Cleveland you're on with Larry the truck driver  Dan's very mad because he thinks he could explain it better to you  oh okay hi Dan  but Larry's still on the line to defend himself  so here we go  Dan go ahead  hey boys  there's a reason this guy's a truck driver  I'm actually an electro engineer and do make money at it  Jimmy ones and zeros is all representational mathematics  everything has a number associated with it 
[01:29:00]  that then represents something else  it's all think of it as just regular languages  somebody knows how to speak Indian  translates it to somebody knows how to speak English  that's all that it is  okay  so there's got to be  some sort of translation tables or something  that converts a one and a zero  into something that a computer needs to know  that's all that it is  really  but why does everything have to have a number?  what else are you going to represent it with?  I don't know  you better represent  you better represent  that's all computers understand 
[01:29:30]  ones and zeros  Larry  does that make sense Larry?  yeah it makes perfect sense  that's a representation of the actual electric state in the computer  the computer's not looking at a one or a zero  the computer's looking at no volts or whatever the value is of the logic  the actual circuitry  it's looking at a zero or a certain voltage level  I just  you guys are explaining it  and I know you're really dumbing it down as much as you can  and maybe if someone showed me in front of my  I just can't wrap my head around it 
[01:30:00]  it's like Plinko  it's like Plinko  see  you got a piece of information  I don't know what Plinko is  and it goes  you ever see the game  this is the sound my logs make  when I don't drink enough water  Plinko  just a little piece comes out  Plinko  see if you have a piece of information  that's got to go through  a processor  which is  just a bunch of transistors  miniaturized  it's going to go  okay  this one's off  I can't go through that one  this one's on  alright I go through this one  it's just 
[01:30:30]  taking forks in the road constantly  until it gets where it has to be  how fast does that happen though  it's so fast  for everything to come through  you know how quick that's going  it's a  it's either on or off  billions of times per second  billions of times per second  billions of times per second  that's just silly  per second  is that moving  is that moving at light speed or no  yes it's electricity  it is  yeah  that's light speed  speed of light  electricity  alright  thanks  light fucking moves man  thank you guys very much  for a second 
[01:31:00]  more importantly  incest wants to help you out  with cheat codes and stuff  no he wants to explain how he  fucks up  multiplayers  incest  what's up  incest  what's going on brothers  how you doing  alright man  your best  okay  I'm a  my bachelor's  is in  computer programming  my major  is in  engineering  and  we  in Battlefield 2  we  completely broke it down  and  basically 
[01:31:30]  to dumb it down  we made it so that  bullets coming at you  were going to  three inches to the left  three inches to the right  up down  left right  and bullets that were going at you  were  we were making it so that they could go  straight through armor  straight through  and that they would  pretty much home in  on the target  and  we  got kicked off of xbox  we  got 
[01:32:00]  we got completely fucked  we got fined  uh  but  it's easy to do  it's not hard to do  a simple  two classes  in computer engineering  will  teach you the tools  that you need to open  the golden gates  of fucking people  over  it's like an infomercial this guy  but how did they  throw you off  like a great hacker  or like one of those guys  who's like an anonymous  like one of those fucking  like the one of those  hardcore guys  have fixed it so xbox  couldn't have thrown them  off or couldn't know 
[01:32:30]  what they're doing  here's what happens a lot of  times the guy shut up  shut up shut up  here's what happens a lot  of times  they'll be playing  and cheating  and other people in  multiplayer that they're  playing with goes  what the fuck  and reports them  and says i think they're  cheating and then microsoft  looks into it  and they have their own guys  yeah  who are just as smart  who can  they're like  hacker level guys  themselves  they can tell when  somebody's been using  a fucking  jacked unit  yeah because  that's no fun right 
[01:33:00]  no  we didn't get  thousands of players  not doing that  we had a pink sock  that was on our team  that decided that he was  gonna be a fucking  big guy and  go and tell everybody  about  what we were doing  and  that's how it  got around  and  ended up  uh  fifteen grand  in the hole  and  almost served  the L10 for it  but  so i'm banned  from all  fucking microsoft systems  i can't get back 
[01:33:30]  on any of them  but  it's easy to do  it's binary  it's all  yeah  well  i wish  i wish i was back  and i could hook you up  and you would just  and i would get thrown off  too that's great  yeah great  fucking thrown off  all right  you microsoft criminal  let's go to mitch in  montreal mitch  i'm going down to  mitch in montreal  i'm gonna get your ass  fucking fired  sorry that was a really  bad alec baldwin  go ahead mitch  hi jimmy love ya  hi mitch thank you 
[01:34:00]  uh  all i gotta tell you jimmy  is  play your piano  that's how computers work  that's all you have to know  oh okay  so computers basically work  like white black white black  you mean that were key key  no a player piano  you know where you put the roll in  and it's got the holes in it  and it goes  oh i thought he said  play your piano  no you're saying  player piano  i swear to god at first i thought  you were insulting me  play your piano  like get your shine box  get your shine box  i don't know what a player piano 
[01:34:30]  looks like  jimmy it has a roll  and there's lines  each line represents a key  and if there's a  if there's no hole  in the roll  it's a zero  the second there's a hole  it's a one  when there's a one  the little pin goes in  it plays a key  that's all it is  a computer is a player piano roll  okay  all computers are based upon  mechanical items  mechanisms that were invented  before it  hmm  there you go  that's it  i just i just wish 
[01:35:00]  that i had the kind of mind  that could like a mathematical mind  like these guys have  i cannot comprehend it  i can't grasp it  like i get it  and i know they're explaining it  i can hear them  but my mind doesn't  ah  just can't do it man  yeah  i stink at math  it's crazy stuff  it's very hard to wrap your mind around  it really is  it's just  like when they try to explain like physics  or whatever we listen to  whether it's caco  or even dr steve  and i want to understand it  because i love it so much  and i just can't 
[01:35:30]  yeah i really feel like a chimp  ant remembers a time  and they decided to do away with this  where you had to program your own video games  remember  oh yeah  you had your computer  basic  and then if you wanted to play  i don't even remember the games anymore  you had to like program it yourself  put in fucking thousands of lines of fucking code  right  and that's why people were learning computer languages  and all that  and then someone got the bright idea like that's crazy  this will never catch on  you'd be like if a equals 3  right  then go to line 65 
[01:36:00]  and then you go down to 65  and then line 65  if a equals z plus a b  then go to  it was like this constant  if something happened  then send it to this line  if something happens there  then send it to this  how long would it take?  forever  if you wanted to play a certain game  that's how you  you actually had to program your own computer  wow  a long long time 
[01:36:30]  that before C  because i remember my mother got the gateway for the house  she thought  you know my mom had more foresight than me  and my dumb dad did  because we didn't  we were like fuck computers  i was a teenager going fuck computers  computers  why do i need that?  my mom knew  she's like we should have one in the house  she had no idea that i would one day download  a golden shower picture onto it  oh yeah  but uh  remember the C prompt  you had to like sign on  yeah that's  it was a whole fucking thing  yeah yeah  yep  that was uh  before like real good operating systems  all right 
[01:37:00]  i love that shit though  oh boy  are we done with the ones and the zeros?  yeah cause i'm not gonna  i appreciate people trying to help me  but i i just can't  syntax error  error  line 15  001  and then you had to figure out what was wrong with line 15  remember that shit?  what happened to it?  i was running the game  then you would have to go all the way back to see why line 15 was wrong  yeah you gotta go backwards  i did a bunch of this shit growing up  i just i tried  i did very poorly in high school  in in in dos prompt 
[01:37:30]  that's what we were being  like dos i think is the language  that we were being taught  yeah  i just bought dos for dummies  my behind  and those those uh  i'm kind of i've been kind of interested in those guys who do or  you can kind of belong to anonymous when you say you do  cause they don't have like  they have a spokesman now though i think  i don't know if he's official or if he's  hell of an anonymous  elected himself  he's writing a book or something  but they were going after the fucking uh  i don't know if he's a member or not  i don't know what his deal is  but they were going after the mexican cartel  and they said that somebody had been kidnapped 
[01:38:00]  and fucking  if you don't release this guy  we're gonna  like out all your connections  and then they said the cartel did release the person  the zetas  huh  but then people said it was a hoax  i don't know  oh  what balls to fuck with the cartels  oh man jesus christ  you don't screw with them  oh  cause they have their own hackers  yeah  chop heads off  yeah i mean like that but  they have like they get computer information  they could just go to whoever like has the server  and go tell us  yeah yeah  it will kill you  you tell us tony 
[01:38:30]  i'm fucking amazed with that whole world  these are people who live in a world that i can't  fathom  i can't fathom being that smart on a computer  right yeah  with that crazy to fuck with the zetas  and i can't fathom being that fucking crazy that  you you could just cut somebody's head off  if they fuck with you  i can't i can't live in  either one of those worlds  yeah  it's lunacy  let's uh  let's take a break  so if anybody knows more  i would love to know more  if that thing was a hoax or not  because i'm fascinated by it 
[01:39:00]  fucking phone's lit  they all want to talk about the ones and the zeros  there's so many people out there that are just smarter than me  it's really hurtful  i was hoping nobody would call  like that would be the question everybody wanted the answer to  no man they  but they all have an answer  they all want in  all right maybe we'll do more phone calls in this  or maybe not  we'll make love  or we could do that too jimmy  you're listening to the  you're listening to the  you're listening to the  the opian anthony channel  on sirius xm  where are you 
[01:39:30]  why are you with me  cause i need you to notice me  me me me me me  where are you  why are you with me  cause i need you to notice me  me me me me me  i remember when i met you  you'll notice me me me me me me  Me, hurting me, pain me, say, say about me. 
[01:40:00]  Where were you?  Where were you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  Where were you?  Where were you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  Pain, hurt, pain, get me hurt.  Me, me, no, me, no, me, no, me, me.  Pain, hurt, say, talk about me, sing about me. 
[01:40:30]  Where were you?  Where were you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  Where were you?  Where were you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  Where were you?

[01:42:00]  This piece is my recital  I think it's very vital  To rock a rhyme  That's right, on time  It's tricky, it's okay  Here we go  It's tricky to rock a rhyme  To rock a rhyme  That's right, on time  It's tricky  It's tricky, tricky, tricky  It's tricky to rock a rhyme  To rock a rhyme  That's right, on time  It's tricky  To, to, to, to  Tricky, tricky  I met  Reverend Run  Reverend Run, I mean  47 years old today 
[01:42:30]  Damn  This is old school  Who's birthday is today?  Mine  Yanni's  What?  Yanni in the house  Give me some Yanni  How old's Yanni?  57  Where did Yanni go?  Yanni was big for a little while  During that new age shit  There's 8,000 people on that stage  What's Yanni even doing? 
[01:43:00]  It's like magician music  Magician would be gone  We're watching a video  That has 7.5 million views though  It's doing something right  Yeah  And 7.4 million dislikes  Is that an instrument?  Playing a cock  Yeah  Is that really an instrument though?  It's a didgeridoo  No, I know  But is it an instrument? 
[01:43:30]  It seems like anyone could do that  I know  You just gotta go  Wabba, wabba, wabba, wabba, wabba  He's got six keyboards  This is not terrible though  I'll throw myself under the bus  I went to a Yanni show at Jones Beach  Oh, yes you did  And fully enjoyed it  Was it crowded?  Yeah, it was packed  Wow  It's not for everyone  Oh, let me see  Let's hear it playtime 
[01:44:00]  Exactly, right?  I  Pull my shirt  It hurts, right?  Fucking  20 violin players  Yeah  Women singing  Sounds like I want to dance  In Midnight Cowboy to this  Oh  It's like the party song  Yeah  Yeah  Hansel's in love with himself  Do you get excited like 
[01:44:30]  Oh, I've been waiting all night  For this one?  Yeah  How would you know?  Oh, this is my favorite  Does anyone sing?  Yeah, they do that  Make that  That garbage  Stuff like that  Who enjoys this shit?  I told you  Look at that one  I told you, look at that one  But what can you do with this concert?  I'm not searching them out  But I went once  Does he talk?  And I went and saw that  Kataro once too  At Carnegie Hall 
[01:45:00]  What about Robby?  Robby would have liked it  Did you see Robby?  Robby would have liked this shit  He would have been a fan of this shit  Yeah  What about Kataro?  This is garbage  You like the Kataro?  You think it stinks at it?  Yeah, this is terrible  Jimmy, what about Kataro?  I don't know what that is  Self-indulgent shit  Kataro's even more different than this  Yeah?  Oh yeah, more like spiritual  I just see this as 
[01:45:30]  Give me some Kataro for the boys  Physicians that just want to show off  Oh yeah, they know their instruments  Uh-oh, what happened?  What happened there, Sam?  God  How is fucking he the one that stands out?  Who?  Because his name  In that whole thing  Yanni?  Yeah, how is Yanni the one that's the Yanni?  I don't know  Yanni's just like one of 50 people on that stage 
[01:46:00]  Oh, well, maybe he wrote it all  I don't know  Yeah, it's probably his band  Oh, is it?  Yeah  And I think the ladies love his mustache  And his long hair  And his Greek background  The guys get shirts  Is he Greek?  I think he's Greek  Yeah  Yanni  No Kataro  How do you spell it?  K-I-T-A-R-O  Oh, Jesus  I thought it was Kataro  That's what he was spelling  Kataro  There you go  Kataro looks like the guy from Tora, Tora, Tora  Rumor has he might have been part of the Japanese mafia 
[01:46:30]  Something you don't want to fuck with  Awaken this sleeping tiger  Ready for this?  You're going to hate this  Oh, boy  Yeah, this is Kataro  All right  Chick looks good  Did you go check this out at Carnegie Hall  If they were doing it?  No  No  Ah  It's like fucking renaissance fair music 
[01:47:00]  Sounds like the music that fucking doves should be flying to in a John Woo movie  Yeah, yeah  Like any minute now  Fucking Chow Yun-Fat should be shooting 48 people  Wow  This all of a sudden gets  Sam Fear  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play 
[01:47:30]  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  I'm going to play  Jesus.  Look at me 
[01:48:00]  I'm toodly-doo-ro  Gotta get this out of the way  Go ahead, Mikey  Go ahead, Mikey  Mikey  Hey, Hope, did you say you went to see Yanni and Concert, man?  Yeah, go ahead  Faggot  He just yells out, faggot 
[01:48:30]  I went with a girl, alright?  I went with a girl  So did she  Bob in Jersey, Bob  Hey there, Bap  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  If you really want to get into this kind of music  Tangerine Dream is the band  Remember in Risky Business when Tom Cruise was banging Rebecca DeMornay  Oh, in the train  Well, more than that, Tangerine Dream was used throughout the entire movie, sir 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, that is true  Yes  Vangelis is another one  Tangerine Dream is extremely trippy  Yes, Blade Runner, very good  What?  Vangelis  Oh, Vangelis, right  Vangelis  Why Vangelis?  Van find out you drive other Van?  That would make him jealous 
[01:49:30]  Oh, God, Jimmy  My face is hot  Terrible  Do you want to hear some Tangerine Dream?  Yeah, let's hear a little of this, man  Really?  Love on a real train  This is massage music  This is fucking music  My dick is jumping right now  Is it twitching?  I'm actually moving my asshole back unconsciously  You're backing into something? 
[01:50:00]  I'm hoping for the bag sweep with the old fingernail  The bag sweep  It's got names for it  Is that a move?  Great  In the massage business?  Yeah  The bag sweep?  Yeah  It's like when you're trying to slide around the catcher at home plate  Yeah  And you fucking zip around them  And your pinky just swipes the fucking home plate  Yeah, that's what the bag sweep is  It's when they're trying to fucking  They rub in the back of your thighs  And they just give the old  Across your scrotum 
[01:50:30]  That's what it sounds like with a fingernail  Mosey's over there  Does that mean they're open to the possibilities?  Sometimes  This sucks  Just does this the whole time?  Yeah, pretty much  It's terrible  Well, this is for the movie  Yeah, I know  Is that a movie?  Well, without the scene  It just kind of sits there  Is what you're saying?  Yeah  You need the visual element, too?  Yeah  Alright, well, Yanni is 57 today  Revin' Run is 47  Whatever 
[01:51:00]  And Pete Townsend admitted his bisexuality 21 years ago  What?  Yeah  I thought he fucking  I'm absolutely crying over here  I thought he admitted it when he wrote Rough Boys  He wants to bite and kiss you  What?  Oh, really?  Is that  I don't know  But if you've got a song called Rough Boys  And you're talking about biting and kissing  Actual lyrics to that song?  Yeah, it's a little much  And the band just went with it

[01:56:00]  Behind the wise  Wise is bad  Sounds good  Yeah  No one knows what it's like  It doesn't even sound like him  To be hated  Julie Taylor in Baltimore  Wants us to check out  Bent Cold Sidewalk  By Tangerine Dream  He says it ain't bad  I don't want to fucking listen to any more  Tangerine Dream  One more  One more  It's giving me orange nightmares  Oh  Ready for this?  You hear what I said?  Yes  Bill Taylor says it's a great song  Or ain't bad 
[01:56:30]  Is this off of hysteria?  This is like Def Leppard  They are  Pour some sugar on me  Not a fan  Love bites  Love please  They are  That's what this is  Terrible  Bring me to my knees  I like Def Leppard 
[01:57:00]  Oh they're horrendous  This is  And you like Def Leppard?

Stunk  That's how  I liked one song  Bring it on the heartache  Everything after that I despised  Bring it on the heartache  Yeah that was a good one  You're actually singing?  Is this Dream Theater? 
[01:57:30]  Tangerine Dream  Is this?  Oh this is only part one of two  Oh my god  The first part is how long?  Eight minutes  Eight minutes  Get out of here  Get out of here  Tangerine Dream  Blow me  That's stupid  Part one of two  Just how about you make one?  You know make it a new song  No one will notice  Just make it a 15 minute song  It's okay  What?  This ends and then you gotta find part two on YouTube?  Yeah  To continue your experience?

Being disabled  Oh  Oh  See  Somebody's scared  Someone's scared  Oh well  Wow  Who else was checking out that Johnny Cash guy over the weekend?  A lot of people on the Twitter were saying  I couldn't get enough of the fucking guy  They felt all bad that he was dead  He did a great  Jesse Morris by the way 
[01:58:30]  Jesse Morris  He did a great  Jesse Dixon  What was the song he was doing?  It was a Henry Rollins  A Black Flag song  Which was cool man  You liked that?  Yeah  I saw you tweeted that  Yeah  I watched a bunch of his stuff  It was so  This is just a guy standing in a subway  By a fucking escalator  Hey Mr. Fucking Motivation  Get out there and do something  Well one of the articles I read  He definitely hung himself  Yeah  He attempted that back in September  Failed  And then they said  Well he didn't fail this time 
[01:59:00]  Hung himself?  Just turned 28  28 years old  Jesse Morris  Who seems like he had a lot of fucking talent  But some demons  We could have had him on the show  I would have just fucking had him play Johnny Cash songs for me  I had to squeeze that in again  Well I know it'll be okay  When I get that big flag in me  Thank you  My girlfriend asked me which one I like better  I hope the answer wouldn't have said her 
[01:59:30]  I was born with a bottle in my mouth  I've got six and I'll never run out  Well I know it'll be okay  Must up that tattoo on his neck I bet  But I get that big flag in me  And he got a little  Chafed  Got $35 and a six pack to my name  Who gets a tattoo on their throat?  Dude he sounds exactly like Johnny Cash  There's no one that could ever do a better cash than this  Damn 
[02:00:00]  And then nothing  Just like Johnny Cash  He just played to no applause when he was done 
[02:00:30]  That's the amazing part  It's like one guy or two guys just walking by  Yeah  He was a staple  They knew him too in that area  Ah fuck  Dan in Jersey  We might be onto something with some music here  Dan go ahead sir  Hey what's going on  Hi Danigans  Hey uh  You know  There's another subliminal fucking gay thing that I  When you guys are talking about  I just remind myself of  That band Extreme that sang More Than Words  I don't know what the name of the album was  But I'm fucking 
[02:01:00]  The beginning of the cassette that I had  What year was it Danny Byrds?  What year?  Ah dude it's early 90s or late 80s  Whatever the fuck it was  But it starts off  No women allowed  Like no chicks allowed  Oh wow  As a kid I'm like  Yeah man that's fucking cool  You don't want chicks anywhere  I'm like that is fucking gay  What straight  You know  Yeah cause those guys were past the  You know  The chicks thing  Not being cool  You know what I mean?  Yeah yeah  I think we all go through that stage 
[02:01:30]  Where hey man  Let's keep the chicks away from us  Some guys stay on that  But yes  I'm still in it  Yes my feet run fire  But Extreme was already in their 20s  They should have known better  I hated Extreme  I don't know who they are  We always had a  Oh you know Extreme  We always had a cater to Nuno  Who was a nice guy  But I never  Nuno Bettencourt  I never dug his scene man  You didn't like Wholehearted  Or More Than Words  Nah it was alright  Or the other one  Wholehearted  Or then More Than Words  This song was alright 
[02:02:00]  Big 12 string sound  Oh yeah I've heard this  Sure  This one I don't mind  More Than Words  Oh  You know how it goes?  Yeah  Just like it  Oh yeah  Yeah  20 million views?  Fuck yeah dude  This was a massive song  I just didn't like anything else they did  What year is this? 
[02:02:30]  I couldn't even name another song they did  Okay  What is this 90?  This song's 20 years old?  Yeah  I'm pretty sure  Nah we're not going to play this shit  If it's anything else  It's 91  90 or 91  That's what I'm thinking  But that Jesse Morris  Fucking  So depressing  It was a bummer all weekend  Fucking people  Just don't forget  What happened?  Hey Ant  Didn't George Burns sing an extreme song?  Oh my god  Did he?  You asshole  What song?  I don't know 
[02:03:00]  If you don't like what you see here  Get the funk out  Alright  I should know that song  I remember  It's like when you look back at your awfulness on radio  The first time I was ever on the radio  Yesterday  Friday  Yes and what's coming up this week  My friend Frank Del Pizzo  Is a comedian I used to open for  He kind of like mentored me a lot  When I was  Oh Del Pizzo  My mother  And he brought  He used to do this local radio show  He would go on and make appearances  In South Jersey 
[02:03:30]  To plug Rascals  And he was very popular  On a Tuesday  He'd bring in 250 people  I mean they loved Frank  So he would just go on the fucking radio  And he brought me on one time  And I was just standing at the mic  Like I didn't know what to say  And he goes  He goes  He goes  Say hi Jim  And I went  Hi Jim  No  Oh no  An old vaudevillian fucking joke  Did it work?  It worked right?  No  No? 
[02:04:00]  Hi Jim  It didn't break the ice?  No  I should have  I should have broken my neck  Should have broke the ice like in The Omen  That's The Omen 2  That's why I didn't laugh at that  Oh right  Okay  I thought it was  You didn't say that  I would have said Omen 2  I'm sorry Chip  You would have  Yeah I would have said  I would have said  What are you skating or something?  What a horrible way to go  Oh  Especially when they were all looking at him  And he's just waving at them  I don't think he was waving was he? 
[02:04:30]  Oh that's right  He's pounding on the ice  Oops  What a great scene that is  When fucking Damien is begging Mark  To like  Or wants him to  Like really wants him to stay  Yeah  Don't make me beg you Mark  Yeah  That little creep  He was great that fucking guy man  Little ghoul  I'll ask you once more  And you knew Mark was fucked  Yeah  Then he got the old ring in the ears  Yeah that's right  Just fell down  Damon's fucking little devil ears 
[02:05:00]  Fucking perfect bowl hairdo  Hey devil head  He was an adorable little evil thing  You think the devil would tattoo the inside of the asshole  Where no one would see it  Stupid devil  Right on the head  Puts it on the scalp  Why don't you just put one on each eyelid  So when he blinks everyone knows  Devil boy  Devil boy  Fucking Satan's a douche  That's some good logic right there  Yeah why would he do that  Up his asshole  Why don't you put 360  Why don't you put one under the fingernail  One in the asshole  And one under the foot  Don't clump them all together 
[02:05:30]  You lazy dev  Dev's all lazy  Where should I tattoo the boy  I'm late for work  Quick give me his head  Six six six  Good  People will think it's nines  I'm Ted the Antichrist  They'll think they're nines  Trust me  Or zeros with tails  Nobody will know  There's three sixes  On the boy's head  How did nobody notice that  When he was an infant  I know right  Before he has any hair  On his head  How did the first fucking barber  That he was  That was cutting his hair 
[02:06:00]  And I dropped the scissors  Run into a church  Yeah  Not for nothing  But your boy  Has the number of the beast  On his head  He's the devil incarnate  Yeah  Imagine the shaky hands  On the fucking  Watch his ear  Yeah  Bold devil ears  Hearing everything  From hell  Hades  Hades  Hades  Some people call it hell  I call it Hades  Jesse Dixon  How scary was it  When the guy goes to the train car  And fucking sees 
[02:06:30]  Damien's picture  On that fucking  Ancient wall  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That was a creepy ass movie  Fucking  Fuck yeah it was  Creepy  Yeah  And the uh  What was the guy's  The guy's name  Fuck I can't remember the name  But that was a  Oh this is the 1976  The trailer  Ah the trailer  The original  20th century Fox presents  The Thorns have been a family  Of tremendous wealth  Position and power  The perfect marriage 
[02:07:00]  Of Ambassador Robert Thorne  And his wife Catherine  Was fulfilled  By the birth of their son  Damien  Oh  Oh boy  And then  A little fat  When the child  Was five years old  Something terrible  Happened  Creepy looking kid  Gregory Peck  Yeah  Damn  What a bad devil boy  Yeah  Pulling mother's hair  It happened again  Oh yeah  He made like the baboons  Go crazy  At that zoo thing 
[02:07:30]  Oh right  Was it an accident  Was it murder  Murder  Was it a coincidence  Or was it  An omen  Look at me Damien  That was great  It's all for you  Oh my  Hangs herself  That was crazy  In front of all the kids  It was a film  Of psychological suspense  About an occurrence  Of birth chicken  At the birthday party  Yeah  Lee Remick  Lee Remick  The omen  Imagine being that clown  I was at the hospital  Mr. Thorne  And I took  And you realize 
[02:08:00]  You get hired  To do the devil's birthday party  Whose kid is it  Satan's  Satan's kid  There was a clown there  You're on right after  The hanging  And Rich Voss  The hanging  Then Rich Voss  And then you  Sends mother  Over the fucking rail  Why wouldn't you just kill him  Well that's kind of hard to do  He always saw things coming 
[02:08:30]  Yeah but Dev had people  Working for him  Yeah yeah  There are those  Who will kill for him  Oh them dogs  Who is he  What does he want  Where did he come from  Where'd that kid end up  I don't know  What's he doing these days  He's all grown up  Like yeah I'm Damien  He probably still wears that hat  When he's out  So people recognize him  I wouldn't do that  Do you remember me  40 years ago  No we don't  Cause you were a boy then  You were just a creepy man  See where he is  That was 76  He was like 5 years old  In 76  35 years ago 
[02:09:00]  So he's about 40  41  42  He's probably still waiting  To get called to do more  Omen movies  Yeah  He just doesn't realize  It's not happening  Let's see  Harvey Stevens  What else has he done  Let's look at his acting work  It's not good  It's not good really  Oh yeah  He had a bit role  In the 2006  Omen remake  As tabloid reporter number 3  Tabloid reporter number 3  Yeah  So he made a movie  The Omen  In 1976  Then he did  A TV movie 
[02:09:30]  In 1980  Yeah  And then he was in  The Omen remake  In 2006  And then his credit  Is the Howard Stern show  Howard Stern on demand  Oh  He did a couple of those  I guess he did a couple of those  And that's it  This guy never really  Worked in Hollywood again  Wow  Poor kid  It's like  Young little Danny  From The Shining  Never did anything either  And that's what he looks like  That's him now  He looks  He looks like a  He looks like a problem  No those eyes though  Fuck  Yeah  Don't look anything like the kid 
[02:10:00]  You see it in the eyes  He's all old and stuff  No way  You don't see it in the eyes  I want to see him in a hat  Yeah  I want to see him in a hat  Put him in a hat  By a fucking lady  In a fishbowl  Falling off a banister  Yeah  That was creepy  Damien  This is all for you  For you  Which jumps up and hangs himself  Kids party  Does he do like comic cons and stuff  I've not seen him in any of the ones I've been to  And I've been to a lot  I bet he'd do pretty well right  I would think so  Damien  So what does he do for money  He's probably got a job  They probably sell his hats  What's his job  Go to Wikipedia or something  I want to know what this guy does 
[02:10:30]  Because that's a hell of a start to your career  And then it goes nowhere  And then you get nothing  His parents suck  I know  Born in London  He's Agent Robert Eatman  Oh shit  I also want to know who's in part two  Because that kid was great too  Yeah  He was more recognizable  Because he was like 12 or 13  Right  He was working on a film in 2008  And said he had started appearing  At autograph signings  With his tricycle  Oh no 
[02:11:00]  Does he have to sit on the bike?

[02:22:00]  And wants us to do one of these a month now  Get the fuck out of here  Like a period  That ain't happening  No  We like being out and about  But let's relax  I'd rather do it on my time  That's right  Thanks for nothing  An Opie and Anthony holiday event this Thursday  Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square  If you show up, you're getting in, right?  At this point?  Yeah  Okay, good  8 to 10 a.m. is when we're broadcasting live  And then you got the shit show after that  That's right  I think we might take up a little of your time  That's fair  Why?  But you guys are going to be signing after too  I'm going to take up your time driving home 
[02:22:30]  Exactly  Wait  Who said we're signing?  Well, you gotta sign  I ain't signing shit  You gotta sign for the people  The people are there  You'll be signing  To see the same faces and go  How many of these do you need?  Bobo needs another 8 by 10  That's so true  No, I'm not even, I mean, come on  That's hilarious  Because it's like, really?  How many of these do you have?  And then  Well, guess what  And then in the same event  They'll go to the back of the line again  Yeah  Guess what?  You guys were the ones that said  You wanted new pictures  So when else  That is true, Sam  No  When else are they going to be able to get the signed 
[02:23:00]  Iron Sheik photo?  That's true  They said, and I said  If we're going to do it, they'll get a new picture  Well, guess what?  If you want the signed Iron Sheik photo by Opie and Anthony  You've got to go to the Hard Rock event  You've got to meet your radio heroes  Opie and Anthony and Jim  They'll sign the picture  You'll see the pee stain  It'll be great  That's true  Plus, Dan, if you go to a convention after that  Imagine getting the Iron Sheik to sign it  Holy shit  That is like fucking an amazing picture  I got the Sheik to sign mine  Yeah?  I got it blown up  And it's big, bigger than 8 by 10

Well, I don't know who you're talking about  But yes  What is their logic behind that?  By the way, every event  We should do a different picture  Yeah, of course  What's the logic behind this? 
[02:24:00]  It's fun  It gets you guys out in front of people  Alright, so we do that  Makes us think of more ideas  It's Thanksgiving  We're giving thanks  That's right  So thanks  They're hoping we do a Christmas one now, too?  I'd love to do a Christmas one  Well, I don't think  I sure hope not  We could do a Christmas Jubilee  Well, it's more Hanukkah  I would love to do these  Jubilee, yes, of course  I would love to do these  If we could do it our way  We used to do the eggnog drinking contest  Remember?  Well  With not one problem  But then the lawyers found problems  Out of nowhere  But this is viewed as like automatic publicity 
[02:24:30]  You get the show's name out there  All the people are hopping  New York City is abuzz  With Opie and Anthony's name  On the marquee  Who are those fellas back in town?

You go ahead  See, we should have  A limited edition  Kenny knows  Why Kenny?  Rubber stamp  Just rubber stamp it  That'd be nice  I'll take the stamp  Here you go  I like how you put  Your finger up  So you got  Lootman7 on the Twitter 
[02:26:00]  He writes  Touching  Penn State takes  A moment of silence  After 10 years of silence  That's funny  That's a great line  Motherfucker  Lootman7  Touching  Well, they played  Their first football game, right?  Since this all went down  Was it for the victims?  Yeah, and they had  A moment of silence  They didn't have  A moment of silence  They were writing  For the coach  Fucking dickheads  They're saying  Dunski  Everyone wore blue  They wore blue  I thought they were  Supposed to wear white  No, they changed it to blue  Because I guess blue  Is the international  Kid-touching color 
[02:26:30]  Oh, is it?  Yeah, I think it's like  Against child abuse and stuff  And they sold shirts  For charity and stuff  So instead of a whiteout  It was a blueout  Blue, ants wearing blue  But I'm in support of  Child abuse  I mistook the message  They turned their  Whole website blue  That's great  That's what Sandusky's  Balls were  When he was watching  All those youngsters  Run around  Until he got them  All lathered up  In the shower  You tell them, Jimmy  That Sandusky's balls  Were blue  Got them in the shower  Pinned them against the wall  Big heavy coordinator balls 
[02:27:00]  Here's Sandusky  Through Second Mile  The charity he founded  Oh, yeah  Sandusky's maintained  His innocence  Oh, Sandusky, right  Sandusky's  The road to his home  Is blocked off  And private property  Signs on his lawn  Why does he get  Protection like that?  Police say a cinder block  Was thrown through a window  Oops  Nearby neighbors  Question why he's out on bail  It baffles my mind  I think presumption of innocence  We all like to believe in that  And we do  In this country  But I think there's a level  Of protection  That a neighborhood 
[02:27:30]  And a community  Is entitled to  Melissa and Carl Anderson  Have two little boys  Carl was such a fan  Of Sandusky's  At one time  He had an autographed  Limited edition copy  Of Sandusky's book  Touched  For me at least  It alternates between  Anger and sadness  Really  I mean it really is  A loss of  Kind of community  Wholesale community  Innocence  Have you seen more police  Here in the last week?  Yes  The Andersons for one  Who cares about them?  Who the fuck the Andersons? 
[02:28:00]  Mr. Anderson  Oh yeah, listen to this  The judge's law firm  Listed her as a volunteer  For second mile  Right  CNN's legal analyst  Jeffrey Toobin  The judge certainly  Should have raised the issue  Disclosed her connection  To second mile  So that the parties  In the case  Decide whether they  Wanted to ask her  To recuse  Recuse yourself  And it's unclear  Whether the judge  Has any current  Affiliation 
[02:28:30]  With second mile  CNN  Has tried to contact her  But so far  We haven't gotten  A response  Yeah, I bet  Alright, Mary Snow  Will follow it  Thanks Mary  And just after  The bottom of the hour  We're gonna look at  Mary Snow  What a bunch of shit  That is  The fucking judge  That gives him  An unsecured bail  So he can be out  Without paying anything  Is connected with him  And his organization  The prosecution  Wanted like  500 grand  And an ankle bracelet  The guy is  A fucking  A child rapist 
[02:29:00]  For the love of fuck  He just  He should not  That's not safe  They don't get better  He's in that house  Just thinking  Of dicking a kid  That's what he's doing  In that house  Real Phil Hendry  I love following him  On Twitter  He's a great broadcaster  He says that  Sandusky  Is still getting  A pension too  Penn State  The thing is  He's getting about  5,000  5,000 dollars  A  Would that be a month 
[02:29:30]  I don't know  Sorry Jimmy  Go ahead  No but shouldn't  He probably should get it  Until he's found guilty  Because literally  He's still innocent  I mean  It seems like  He's a real piece of shit  And it looks guilty  But you should probably  Get that until you get  No I understand that  But I guess my point  Is that a lot of people  Say hey  He wasn't with  The college anymore  He's getting about  60 grand  60 grand  So 5,000 a month  And that's why  I bring that up  He was still  Very much connected  With Penn State 
[02:30:00]  And the college  Absolutely doesn't  Have to adhere  To the due process  They can do  Whatever the fuck  They want  You know  Nah with a pension  I don't know about that  I think  That they have to  Adhere to that  Can't just yank  Somebody's pension  Until he's proven guilty  Why not  Let him sue  I agree  But  You know  You can't do it  Until he's found guilty  Charge him for all those  Tiny little assholes  He got at the school  How much does that go for 
[02:30:30]  That would be a lot  Rich in New Hampshire  You guys have to play  The audio from the  Today show  Sandusky talks about  How he loves kids  Creepy stuff  Oh really  Would they have an old  Interview huh  Probably  Probably not a new interview  That would be awkward  I love kids  How do I love the kids  Penn State lost by the way  Last home game  12 to what  12 to  17 or some shit  17 to 14  12 to  Don't embarrass us  12 to 8 I think it was  Sorry Jim  I don't know  But Joe Paterno's son  Is the quarterback coach 
[02:31:00]  I think  Yeah  Quarterback coach  For Penn State  And he got emotional  After the game  What did you have to  Manage yourself  In trying to coach  Through this football game  Well once we got here  And the juices  Started to flow  I was focused  And you know what  That's the way  We've been trained  Joe has always taught us  About the blue line  Of practice  When you cross the blue line  The only thing you can control  Is what you're doing  Right there  So we just had to imagine  There was a blue line  Coming into the stadium  And once we were here  We were folks  In the task at hand  And just a little short 
[02:31:30]  I know you visited  With your dad  Earlier today  Your dad and Sue  And you wrote him a letter  To try to  Deliver your message  To them  Essentially  What were you trying  To share with them  Just how proud of them  I am  And dad  I wish you were here  We love you  Through your tears  Yeah he lost  Through your tears  Yeah I wish you were here  Dad but  You were too busy  Not going to the authorities  When you heard a 10 year old  Was being fucked in the shitter  Yeah  Absolutely crying over here  The 10 year old ass 
[02:32:00]  The photogs  The photogs  The stupid photogs  The photogs  I was down by the photogs  And I took a picture  Of Sandusky fucking  A 10 year old  Can you play that please  The photogs  When you  Yes we're live  Bruce where were you buddy  I was right up under  The photogs  You know it's amazing  Watching Pete Townsend  And Roger Daltrey  Perform these songs  After all these years  And still have the  The full spirit  Of what they do 
[02:32:30]  Under control  I mean you know  Townsend just continues  To be an amazing guitar player  I'm sorry  I'm absolutely crying  I can't help it  I really can't  This is no fake  You know the whole moment  Just kind of  Kind of got to me  With that video  Yeah the video  Was very powerful  Yeah yeah that was  This is very awkward  I'm sorry  But  It was just  I mean you know  It's just the who  You know I can't help  But be a 14 year old kid  Out there with the who  Oh  I'm saying 
[02:33:00]  That's 10 year old  That's it  I'm sorry  You were seeing them live  I guess that was in color  Yeah  Yeah they were live on stage  But the black and white  Was happening on the big screens too  So  Through your tears  So there's  Through your tears  The black and white video  She's great with the  Through your tears  I love that line  Through your tears  You fucking wanker  Is that in your top five  Oh yeah  Top five clips  You play a lot  Top five clips ever  Ever  What else is in there  Mike Schmidt is  About 18 years ago  I left Dayton, Ohio

[02:34:00]  We used to do the wrestling one  But not so much these days  Yeah  That's a great one  That's the worst one of them all  Really  Where he's just yelling  That it's still real to me  Fucking terrible  Do you have it still real to me, Iraq?

Do you think they laughed at the guy  When they like  Walked away from this whole thing?  They're like  Did you see that fucking lunatic?  Utterly humiliated for him  He's trying to move  Still real to me  Dammit shirts  And stuff like that  Oh, really?

Through your tears  Another one that's on  Everyone's top five list  Thank you  Yeah  Oh, yeah 
[02:35:30]  Hold on a minute  Goodness gracious  Of all the dramatic things  I've ever seen  You should see what's going on  In the Yankee dugout  Passat is retiring  Fucking wet mouth  Oh, it's horrible  That horrible woman  Boston accent thing  The water cooler's bubbling  Oh, God  We're talking about ones  We do on our show a lot  Because people are saying  The intervention  Best cry ever  Oh, that was a good one  That's a great clip  But we haven't hammered 
[02:36:00]  That one home  Like these other ones  We're talking about  No, but  Oh, God  Here he is  Well, what makes this clip  Is the pause  Can you start over?  I fucked up  Yes  The pause is what makes it  Because I know  Somewhere deep down  In my heart  Guy's still cool  I still love you  I'm rubbing that 
[02:36:30]  Ashtray on his face  Shut up  He has like old  Junkie hands  Yeah, he does  But that pause  Is what makes it  28 million fucking views  On this clip  And there's a million  Versions of this clip 
[02:37:00]  It's the greatest  Fucking  Oh, fuck yeah  That clip's been cloned  So many times online  Auto-tuned  Turn it up  Oh, near the auto-tune  Take this down  Back  That was great  How's he doing? 
[02:37:30]  That's got 10 million views  10 million views  That's the greatest  Turns out he can't  Touch pensions  I'm learning  Even OJ still gets  His pensions  Yeah  That's true  That's a tough one  I guess  Oh, that guy was the worst  He just looks at the guy  Steven S. from Basher 
[02:38:00]  Of course  That guy's mouth  Went off like an air raid siren  This Newt Gingrich, man  Holy fuck  What are you thinking, Ant?  That's your side of the fucking table  My side of the table  What do you think?  I don't know  Is he going to give  Mitt a run for his money  Or what?  I still say there's  Too much time left  I love how he's no-nonsense guy  I'm loving that about him  He is no-nonsense guy  But he's still a fucking year  Before the election  A fucking year 
[02:38:30]  There's plenty of shit  That could go down  But Newt's moving up in the polls  Yeah, well  They're all gonna do that  The second people get tired of one guy  They're gonna gravitate to another guy  He's a douche  Romney looks like he's just holding on for dear life  You know what I mean?  He's  I don't know  Like you said, though  It's a year  So why are we even discussing this?  It's a year out  It's just crazy  I just love how Newt's getting in everyone's faces  In these debates  Oh yeah, he's a no-nonsense guy  He's been in the fucking 
[02:39:00]  Hates the media  Been in the biz for quite a while  Fucking hates the media  The media hung him out to dry back in the day  Right  So, yeah  He's not giving them any favors  Yeah  I don't know  I don't think so, Rick  We were gonna talk about this  So let's start with Rick's phone call  Go ahead, Rick  Hey, Rick  Rick  No  It's probably not Rick  The guy that wants to talk about Dana White  No 
[02:39:30]  We can hear you, brother  Oh, God  What's your name?  Craig  All right, Craig  Let me ask you  A very basic question  And I just still don't understand this  You're on the phone, right?  Yeah, I can hear you guys loud and clear  But we have your name wrong  So why are you waiting for us to figure out what your name is?  Didn't you hear us talking to you through the phone?  And in all fairness  Like, you know, we've called into radio shows  I know when they picked my particular lineup 
[02:40:00]  Didn't you hear the phone go like  Pfft  I've never called before  So I have no  All right  I don't mean to beat you up  First time  It just confuses me sometimes  First time, long time  So what's your name, Craig?  Yeah, Craig  All right, go ahead, Craig  Sorry  I got a question of why  They showed the undercards of the Fox stuff  The UFC online  But they didn't show the actual fight  And what they did show live  It seemed like Dana White was pretty pissed  I didn't know if anybody talked to them  But they were looking for that fight to go a lot longer  Well, I'm a little out of this one  Because I went and saw 
[02:40:30]  That was Louis C.K. night, I guess  So I was out and about  But I  Go ahead, sir  There's a new heavyweight champion  It only took a minute and 14 seconds  He knocked Kane out  Yeah, no, it was 64 seconds  It was Dos Santos over Cain Velasquez  Yeah, I just didn't know  And the fight only lasted 64  And you could  I actually did see this  I just didn't see the whole broadcast  Is what I'm saying  And Dana White certainly looked really fucking frustrated  During the post-interview portion of the Fox broadcast 
[02:41:00]  I think he was frustrated with the criticism  And it's like  I mean, look  I wish it would have went longer, too  But again, it's one of those things where in a fight  It happens  Look at all Mike Tyson's fights  Mike Tyson would charge $50 pay-per-views  And his fights were over in a minute and 30 seconds  So it's not exactly unheard of  For fights to be over quickly  And Kane is probably the better fighter of the two  Like, overall  But Dos Santos hits like a fucking dump truck  And he caught him 
[02:41:30]  Can I ask you something?  Were there preliminary fights on Fox?  Yeah, I don't know if they were on Fox  No, just this one  It went from cops to that  But my question is  Fox was only scheduled from like  Like 9 to 10  And they spent a half an hour talking about it  Which is what I don't understand  They probably should have had another fight in there  Maybe  But that's easy to say now  I think they did that because  They wanted to be over before the Pacquiao fight  There was a reason for that  It had something to do with the Pacquiao fight  I don't think they wanted to compete with it 
[02:42:00]  But they wanted to  They knew they would drain some of their numbers  And yeah, it was over quickly  But a lot of people liked it  Just because, you know, it was fucking  It was very quick action  Yeah  I mean, it happens in fighting though  Dana looked frustrated  I mean, if it was up to Dana  He would have loved for the fight to go a little longer  Sure  But he's not going to fix fights or any of that crap  No, you can't  And again, Tyson's the example I would use  All of his fights  There might have been 10 of his championship fights  That fucking went literally under two minutes  And that started to become a problem for the industry 
[02:42:30]  People didn't want to spend the money, yeah  They didn't want to spend the money for a short Tyson fight  He won the title for Michael Spinks  And I want to say it was a minute and 18 seconds  I could be off, I'm just remembering  But it was a very short period of time  Yeah  And instead of people going, oh my god  This Mike Tyson is awesome  But that's what they should be saying about Dos Santos  Because Velasquez has a head like a fucking Neanderthal  There were people that just would not go to the bathroom  When the fight started  You kind of knew  Like when the fight starts 
[02:43:00]  Be looking at your television  The way Tyson came at you to start the fight  Yeah, yeah  It was just unbelievable  Are you playing at Sam?  Look at the arms on Dos Santos  He is a fucking brute  I want to see the brawl here  Kane is usually kicking him  Hold on a second, bro  Hold on  We're just watching the fight a little bit  Again  He just tagged Kane  And Kane is using his legs  He's kicking  Which Dos Santos is not doing  Oh, there he goes  Are you trying to get him down?  Yeah  Kane was absolutely trying to get him down  Yeah  And with Dos Santos 
[02:43:30]  Look at his fucking arms, man  Yeah, he's already hit him with a couple good shots  His arms are meaty  Yeah, he's a big dude, man  Oh, boy  Geek  Just  Oh, good night  Oh, man  Now he's just getting his head handed down  Yeah, he's on  That's it  That  Wow, he clocked him  Did you hear that sound? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah  Look at the arms on him  He's a heavyweight  You heard it go  Yeah  He's a fucking strong guy, man  That shot  He hit him like on the top of the head almost  You think Dana was watching that  And right then he just went  You've got to be shitting me  Yeah  But I mean  In a perfect world  That should have lasted longer for him  Two or three rounds  But look at the shot  He hits him  It's a really weird place  It's an overhand right 
[02:44:30]  Oh, God  Right to the ear  Behind the ear  Behind the ear  What a fucking  Good night  That would kill one of us  Yeah  Six million  I love you guys  Thanks  Thank you, brother  But I don't think Dana was frustrated with the length  There's a lot worse ways it could have ended  It could have been an Anderson Silva debacle  Like where he does some weird shit  Or it could have been a disqualification on some cheap  You know, whatever happens in a fight  Or it could have gone a little longer and had a nice ending  That would have been better for Fox  But they're at Fox  They're not going anywhere  Yeah  He seemed like he was bothered  I don't know 
[02:45:00]  You know, we've seen Dana enough  I think the Twitter stuff bothered him  I didn't see this  I'm only going by what I heard  There were six million people that watched  And he's going to be very successful on Fox  There will be a million fights on Fox  Yeah  Yeah, it will absolutely fucking  It's not going to hurt UFC at all  No, no  It's why I'm going  Let me say hi to Josh in Virginia  Josh  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy  I was calling in regards to the guy  I was all angry about it being a short fight 
[02:45:30]  This has been advertised as a teaser of it  Technically, UFC isn't on Fox until next year  Oh  The whole time, they're trying to build up the situation  And, you know, make it a teaser  They're trying to talk for the first 30 minutes  For the idiots that don't know what UFC is  They're trying to get them, you know, used to it  And when this happens next year  It's going to be a full car to fight  Yeah, that will rule  Yeah, no worries  Yeah  And they also changed  Sorry to interrupt  They also changed one  All main events are going to be five minute, five rounds 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, they did that a little while ago  Yeah  So that's going to make it more exciting  Hey, man  I mean, as a UFC fan, I loved it  Yeah, yeah  But I think Dane is trying to turn new people on to it  So he's probably thinking  Oh, fuck, I wish this lasted a little while  Or fudge  Hopefully he's not seen it  Yeah  I don't know  I could be wrong  Yeah, yeah  It stinks  But that was a crazy fucking fight  Oh, man  Well, thanks anyways, guys  Have a good one  All right  Thank you  I wanted Kane  Because we met him  Yeah  That's the only reason  Junior 
[02:46:30]  I watched the junior season with Brock  When they were both coaching  And then Brock had to drop out  Because of the surgery  And he seems like a really nice guy  Like, I've never met Dos Santos  But just watching that season  He was very nurturing to the fighters  They lost  He was like, ah, don't worry  It's okay  You did your best  Like, he seems like just a really decent guy  This guy works for Fox  Gary in Vegas  Gary  Hey, guys  What's going on?  Hey, buddy  Hey  Half the problem really is that  You know, there was so much hype  Leading up to this  Fox ran promos like there was no tomorrow 
[02:47:00]  You know, he had 40 minutes of talking beforehand  And I think Dana's more pissed off  Than anything else  Than people that are bitching about it  It was for free  You got to see a heavyweight championship fight for free  Right  5.7 million people watched that  The same amount of people that watched Game 5  Of the American League Championship Series  Damn  I think Dana knows what he's doing  And when the contract kicks in officially  Foxes air in four fights all next year  I think January, May, September, and December  Gary, I think you're talking to the UFC fan 
[02:47:30]  I think we all get that  And I think most UFC fans are like  Fuck a championship fight on free TV  This is awesome  But I think in Dana's mind  He's like  This is an opportunity to turn more people on to my sport  And I think in that regard  He wanted the thing to maybe last a little longer  That's all  Oh, I agree a thousand percent  You know, that fight going to the distance  Would have been perfect for him  You would have been, you know  Grilling like a kid on Christmas morning  Right  I don't think any UFC fan was complaining  They're like  They understand the sport 
[02:48:00]  And went  Fuck, that's a fucking great knockdown  Knockout or whatever  I bet you people tuning in  You know what  Everybody likes a knockout  And even people who aren't fans  Who might not have enjoyed the grappling as much  They saw a fucking  Didn't see grappling  They saw a guy with fucking meat fists  Right  Knock a Neanderthal out  Right  They saw a guy with a big tough head  Get knocked the fuck out  Quickly  So maybe they were like  That should last longer  But you can't say it's boring  No  It had a title change too  Yeah, it was a title change 
[02:48:30]  Heavyweight title change  Yeah, it was  Alright, Gary  Thank you, brother  Thanks  No WWE there, Sam  But  WWE doesn't have  A silver fight would have been a nice one  To start with  Well, guys  Suzanne doesn't like the UFC  Oh, well, Suzanne, what's up?  Let's hear your opinion  I'm sorry  I'm a boxing fan  I've always been a boxing fan  To me  This is just  Why don't you go suck Bob Arum's dick  Oh  What did you say, Suzanne?  You're a boxing fan  What?  I'm a boxing fan  This stuff is a joke  It is a total joke  I realize I'm not like kickboxing 
[02:49:00]  I like the other stuff  But this whole thing  Is just  I mean  Just sit there and pay for it  And get these guys  Let me ask you a question  You don't like it  Okay, fine  You don't like the sport  But how can you say it's a joke  When the times that boxers  Have squared off with UFC people  Boxers have been destroyed  Like, how can you say it's a joke  Like, Bernard  Hold on, hold on  Bernard Hopkins  I get that  I get that  They don't have anybody coming up  And besides  They're so corrupt  And we all know that  Boxers, yes  I mean, completely corrupt 
[02:49:30]  And so the ones that are around  Are  Only the ones that are around  That don't have head injuries  That have really good  You know, support  Are the ones doing well  The rest of them are like  Mayweather  They're little puns  But how could you  Suzanne, how could you say though  But how could you say it's a joke  When it really is boxing  And kickboxing  And it's like  There's no standing eight count  Like, when Cain Velasquez went down  If that was a boxing match  He would have been stood up  And given eight seconds  And to collect himself  He had this other guy  Jump on him  And just hit him on the fucking 
[02:50:00]  How could you say it's a joke?  It's a joke  The whole thing  You can't then say  It's just a joke  He's asking you why it's a joke  Why is it a joke?  Oh, it's in the Olympics  What?  Is it in the Olympics?  No, but that doesn't mean anything  It's a newer sport  Neither is fucking  And that's pretty good  Yeah, neither is chess  It's in the Olympics  So that's  Wait, hold on  That's your qualifications  I'm asking you personally  What you don't like  I don't know my qualifications  I'm just saying  I think it's a really  I wouldn't be surprised  If this was part of the Olympics soon  What don't you like about 
[02:50:30]  Isn't it  It's exciting  Isn't it exciting though?  Not really  I mean, I'm not into it  You like when boxers clinch  And stand there  And fucking  Hug each other  Hug each other  And the ref's gotta break them up  Every two seconds  Or do you like  Fast-paced action  Like a UFC  You know that  We've had boxers in here  That say that the UFC's not a joke  And that they appreciate it  Bernard Hopkins thought it was  And he used to badmouth it  He said that  Like a bunch of homos  Rolling around  And then he started training  Shane Mosley to punch  And I was behind him 
[02:51:00]  At the fight  And let me tell you something  The way those  Him and his trainers  The way boxers watch this  The stand-up stuff  They don't care about  Because that's what they do  But it was when the guys  Went to the ground  And were getting fucking  Pounded on the ground  That's when you would see  These guys all lean forward  Like what the fuck  Because there's no break  Yeah  But there's no break  It's like  I mean if you want to play  Gladiator  Play Gladiator  There's no difference  In that than the  20 year ago show  Where they all  Oh god  Now you're crazy 
[02:51:30]  You're just a dummy  Like if you don't like it  You don't like it  Are you kidding me  No you're a dope  Crazy  You're dumb  How about we call you up  And talk about making coffee  Right  For the men  What's that  Is that all you can say  I just said you're dumb  Because I asked why  I disagree with your opinion  But you're a dummy  Yes you're a dummy  Because you said  It's like gladiators  You're a dummy  And your pussy probably stinks  Yeah and you said  It's like gladiator stuff  And it's not in the Olympics  That's what I mean  You're a dumb broad  But look  Make me a cake broad 
[02:52:00]  She's comparing it to this  Why don't you bake  Why don't you clean the toilet broad  Get the plunger out  What do you know  Don't you have dishes to do  Yeah  Don't talk about a man's sport  Don't go do the dishes  Yeah  Why don't you pump out some babies  While the husband owns his keep  Why don't you do the wash  And then get in the kitchen  And start rattling some pots and pans  That's right  Why don't you put your hair in curlers broad  And get me a pie

[02:53:00]  You're making that up  Here's a stat  You suck 100% of the time  There you go  Here's a stat  You're always an annoying broad  There's a 0% chance  That you won't be an annoying dame  What do you think of them apples  Suzanne is greater than nothing  Yeah  Hold on we got Marcos from Yonkers who wants in  Shut your mouth broad  Suzanne is less than  And then just put any male  Right  Marcos go ahead  You're on with Suzanne

And Thursday is hard rock  Yay  Thursday is hard rock  Do we have any guests on Wednesday?  No because  Tuesday is a busy day  Tuesday is a hugely busy day  So  Wednesday we take it easy  We coast a little  Thursday we got the big event at the hard rock  So Friday is busy  So that means Friday we take off 
[03:18:00]  No no no no no  Friday more guests  No we get a free day off  If we do a live broadcast  Or if you take a day off  You get an extra day  As to take off any time you want  I don't even know what you just said  What sense  What are you talking about?  Take a day off because of the live gig  It's tradition  No it's not  When we do a live remote  We take the next day off  It's tradition  No  Because you're doing the live remote  The same hour as you'd be doing a show  What?  You're not doing an extra show  It's the same hour  As a matter of fact  You do less show  Because you get to walk  From here to hard rock 
[03:18:30]  No we do more show  No?  Yeah  How do you figure?  Because there's more to it  Well I mean  You might  There might be more content  In the show  But the hours spent  Doing the show  Are not  Made bigger  There's not more hours done  Because of this live gig  But Friday's CM Punk  Friday's CM Punk  From the WWE  Brian Regan  Brian Regan  And isn't some chick coming in too?  Oh yeah  I saw Shreshenger  I don't know who that is 
[03:19:00]  But  Brian Regan and CM Punk  On the same day  People have been asking  Opie  If we're going to get CM Punk  On the show anytime soon  No one's been asking  They've been asking that for months  They light up my Twitter  Somebody just asked me  This weekend  Because they know  Survivor Series is in town  You know  Coming up on Sunday  And they said  Are you going to get CM Punk  To come in on the after show  We're going to do you one better  On Friday  He'll be here  On the main show  The Opie and Anthony show  Live in studio  Opie  Opie

[03:21:00]  And the movie's awesome  You've seen it already  Yeah I loved it  Yeah  Jason Segel captures a classic  Field of Muppets  It's awesome  Do you like  Practice speaking  In movie poster text?  I do not  Like just in little quotations  That they can add in  At the bottom  Roland says  Your after hours  Is fantastic Sam  Thank you so much  It's not called after hours  So over the weekend  My 18 month old son  Indirectly  Told me  That  I tweet too much  How is that? 
[03:21:30]  That's the tease  That's a tease?  That's not a good tease  It's a great tease  I don't feel like giving you an exclusive  It's not an exclusive  It's just for talking  No it's an exclusive  Well I'm pretty sure  That your son is probably accurate  You should be paying more attention  To life instead of Twitter  There's life outside  The information super highway  There's actual highways  There's sunlight  I'll give you an exclusive  Just because I have a few minutes  Good  So  Will you  Hank Williams  Hank Williams  The third is in town this week 
[03:22:00]  Roland  I'd have him on the show  Someone's asking me questions on this  Phone thing  We're free on Wednesday  Bill in Boston  Oh I got another text  Hold on  Oh my shit  This is incredulous  Dude I didn't want to be here  You chose to engage me  So what are you saying  I mean you're staying here  You trapped me in the corner  Knowing that  You were going to turn on your mic  Well you stayed in the corner  You know what time this show comes on  Thank you Kenny  Listen  Thank you  The Hard Rock event by the way  It's this Thursday  Six days away  If you say you too 
[03:22:30]  Is it T-O or T-O-O?  It's T-U-2  U-2 is T-O-O  T-O-O  It's like three days away  I just started learning the difference between T-O and T-O-O  See that's what  Remember when you said  It's a fun tool to have  When you understand how to use it properly  Remember when you said  Kids didn't really need school  That's where you learn  You pick up little tidbits like that  No you don't  Let's see  You know there's a T-W-O as well  O-B radio on Twitter  Hard Rock Cafe  This Thursday 
[03:23:00]  Sam here's your exclusive  Really quick  Starts at 8am  Cause maybe Aunt Jimmy wouldn't care  Or maybe they'll bring it up tomorrow  Or maybe we'll bring it up together  So  I'll bring it up  I'm giving my son a bath  Thank God  And he loves to hang out in the bathtub  And it's  You know you gotta watch him like a hawk  So I sit next to the bathtub  And I kind of play with him a little bit  But then I get bored  And I either bring my laptop  Or my phone into the bathroom  So I can do some tweeting  While he's taking a bath  And I'll look at my mentions and stuff 
[03:23:30]  Can't you just be like  Experience fatherhood  If it's a 40 minute  Hold on  If it's a 40 minute  40 minute bath  You can experience fatherhood  For about 20 to 25 of those minutes  But you're never gonna have these baths again  He's gonna get to an age  Where it's inappropriate for you to be bathing him  And then you're gonna miss it  But you're gonna think back  What was it like when I bathed my kid  And you're gonna think  Oh  Kurt Love was tweeting me that day  Like you're gonna have these  I'm experiencing  Well it's too much  You're not a parent  You don't get this shit  I have a cat  It's kind of  You can experience fatherhood 
[03:24:00]  To a point  And then you get bored shitless  And you gotta like  Pass the time  Any way you could  You know  Find for yourself  So I'm  So I'm tweeting  And looking at mentions  And just kind of like  Killing time on my phone  While he's splashing around  In the bathtub  But I'm  I'm right up against the tub  In case anything happens  Sure  And all of a sudden  And this is  The God's honest truth  And I hate when comedians say this  Cause you're like  Oh that means it's not true  True story  It really is a true story  So I'm looking down  And I'm either tweeting  Or looking at mentions  And I  I  I 
[03:24:30]  I realized that my son  Threw something  And it hit me in the leg  So I'm thinking  Son of a bitch  The kid has met him on Twitter  Yeah  So he picked up  One of his bath toys  And he threw it at me  To get my attention  Well good  This is what people need to do  He can't speak  And say  Yeah he's  He's not talking yet  Is he  Here's the punchline  It wasn't one of his bath toys  It was a golf ball sized piece of poo  He threw his shit at you  I swear to God  So he's sitting there in the bathtub  And I should have taken a picture  Or a quick little video of it 
[03:25:00]  You see what I mean  No you shouldn't have  To prove that it happened  You shouldn't have taken a picture  Or video of it  Cause then he would have thrown more shit at you  And said  Dad  Right  Be in the moment with me here  I'm a baby  Or he's on the Discovery Channel  So somewhere along the way  As I was tweeting  Or looking at my phone  He made a little poo  In the bathtub  And it was  You know  Rock solid  And about the size of  Like a ping pong ball  Slash golf ball  That's impressive for a baby  But a little like push 
[03:25:30]  So he could get it out  It wasn't like perfectly round  So he was squeezing one out  Specifically for the purpose  Of chucking it  And as I'm looking at my phone  I feel this thing hit  I think it was kind of like  My calf slash foot area  Cause I was kind of  You know  Sitting on the floor  And I went  Son of a bitch  He just threw a toy at me  Well you shouldn't be looking  And it was a piece of shit  He was probably sitting there  Like your son is just sitting there  Shitting all over the bathtub  And you don't even realize  Cause you're tweeting up a storm  It was one piece of poo  That was it  How was the arm?  I'm a little concerned  Cause I think he might be  A southpaw 
[03:26:00]  And that sucks for sports  Wow  In general  I mean you never know  He could be the exception  John Abbott  You know  Jim Abbott  He was missing a hand  John Abbott  I knew a kid named John Abbott  In high school  So I always get the name  Jim Abbott  Was the one  He had no hand  So you know  He managed  You know  I think you need to teach your son  To overcome obstacles  But in order to do that  You gotta get off this Twitter  Well we're gonna  We're gonna tie down his left hand  And make him use his right  Tie it to his back  And just everything  Cause he's at that age 
[03:26:30]  Where he'll never know  That we did that  You make him ambidextrous  And then he becomes  And then he becomes  A right handed pitcher  No you make him ambidextrous  And then he's a real  Then he's a threat  Nah not real  If you are excellent  Both ways  Who else can do that  That's you should be  Raising a child  Who's better than everybody  Name one brilliant  Switch hitter  I can't name one  Switch hitter  So I couldn't even  Start to name a brilliant  Switch hitter  You started this  So you should have knowledge  On what you're talking about  Having this  How about  Okay your son  That's the one  He's not playing baseball yet 
[03:27:00]  Well make him play baseball  Right now all he's doing  Is throwing shit at his father  For tweeting too much  But it's a great start  And I think more people  Should throw shit at you  For tweeting too much  I mean he's sitting there like  I am having  A developmental moment  Where I'm starting  The transition into manhood  And my father is sitting there  Arguing with Justin Bieber fans  I'm trying to you know  Experience being raised  In the real world  And he's sitting there  Writing hashtag Selena Gomez 
[03:27:30]  Where am I  Is what your kid is saying  Oh here's what I'll do  I'll just  Shit out a nice log  And chuck it at him  And he deserves it  I did deserve it  And he deserves it  And it made me laugh  To be honest with you  I'm like yeah  This is my son  He really  I was about to say  This is my son  You really are raising him  In your image  Oh fuck  Well next time  That is a true story  It wasn't a bath toy  It was a piece of his  His fecal  Fecal material  Yes  Next time a guest  Comes in here 
[03:28:00]  That you don't like  Remember that  Really?  Yeah and just throw shit at him  Yeah like CM Punk  Yeah maybe I could do that Friday  See now look  Your phone's lit  Because people can relate  To that story I just told  The phone's are lit  Why don't you talk to  Some parents today Sam  Do something a little different  Maybe learn about  This parenting thing  I gotta  I mean I know what it's like  You might be heading down  This road soon  I've had the cat  For a couple years  So it's like  Oh I gotta make sure  It's okay  Take some calls from parents  They're gonna have  Shit stories for you now  I'm telling you right now  Look at this shit  I did shit stories 
[03:28:30]  With Roland on Friday  What do I need shit stories  From parents for?  Plus  Wait what is that one?  When he's old enough  To golf  And you got a  A shitty lie  You can borrow his club  See there you go  I don't like  I don't like golf  I don't know anything  About kids  I'd never take that call  That was a golf joke  You have to have knowledge  Of golf to understand  What that guy was getting at  Well guess what  On After Open Anthony Live  We don't do golf stuff  Golf  Golf  Golf  We don't even bring it up  So it doesn't matter  How you pronounce the word  It never comes up  In conversation  Golf  This is not a show 
[03:29:00]  That is golf centric  Why didn't I tell that story  On my show  It worked  Because  Why didn't I do it  On my show  It worked  This  Because you feel  Comfortable here  I had a nice punchline  Yeah but Paul  It was a perfect story  Paul's gonna laugh  At whatever you say  The beauty of that story  Was  The beauty of the story  You were laughing  Because you're like  Oh that's funny  That a dumb  My son's not dumb  An 18 month old kid  Is throwing toys  Because I'm on Twitter  And that's funny  And it's alright  And then it turns out 
[03:29:30]  To be a piece of shit  Which brings it into  A whole nother level  It's great  Because you think  You've hit the punchline  And then you really  Hit the punchline  Jared in Massachusetts  You're on  After Open Anthony Live  Yeah thanks Tim  Hey Ope  You actually want  A left handed pitcher  They tend to be more valued  And there are some  Decent switch hitters  One of them was named  Mickey Mantle  The Mick  Of course  But I  Oh  You okay  Yeah I thought  I was gonna  Have a conversation  With the guy  Well you can still  Respond to his statement  We keep the callers 
[03:30:00]  Quick here on  After Open Anthony Live  We don't have time  For the bullshit  I don't want my son  To play baseball  Why not  It's boring  He's not Dominican  No it's just boring  I want him to be a golfer  Golf is the most boring thing  Anybody can do  Yeah but some of the courses  They play are awesome  No they're not  No there is no  And then I'll be some old dude  Like following my son around  As he's on the PGA  That's a great life  There has never been  That is a great life  Has never been an awesome golf course  Unless it's a mini golf course  Every actual golf course 
[03:30:30]  Is the opposite of awesome  It's just a field with holes in it  Sam why don't you name one golf course  The Masters  That's not a golf course  Augusta  There you go Augusta  They're all just  Which is a beautiful course  Yeah except they're all just  Fields  It's a beautiful course  With inconvenient ponds  No that's what you see  Because you don't understand the sport  No you're supposed to shoot  Over the ponds  And into the holes  Sam  That's how golf works  Yeah  Nobody said anything about that  Are there ponds on the field  Yes  Are there holes on the field 
[03:31:00]  Yes  Then what part of my statement  Needed correcting  The whole thing  It's not a field  It's a course  It's a field  It's just grass  With holes and sand  And what is wrestling  Amazing  What is wrestling  Excuse me  I didn't come on here  What is wrestling  There are some  Amazing wrestling rings  What is wrestling  There is wrestling  Sports entertainment  Right  What part is entertaining  The part that people watch  I mean it's  What part of it is entertaining  Every part of it  And what part is the sport  The athletic part 
[03:31:30]  Although you're all talk now  CM Punk's going to be  Sitting in that chair  And you're going to be  Opie with his mouth shut  You're going to be  Back to tweeting  And CM Punk's going to  Throw his shit at you  What's wrong with that  Well you can't  You can't disrespect  You interview  Sports entertainment  CM Punk  Can I  Yes  I would love to  No problem  I don't think you'll  Get an argument  From Anthony  You guys will just  Take off  And let me  Take over  Just make sure  The interview's  At what time  What time's the interview

[03:32:30]  Before then  Alright boys  Have fun at the Muppets  I will  And really  Lay off the Twitter  Go Twitter dark  For a little while  Less is more sometimes  Your kid is telling you now  He threw shit at me Sam  He threw a lump  Of baby shit at you  He said wear this  As a mustache  Jerk  You should get off  Twitter for a second  And realize  I'm becoming  A human being  Over here  Look at my little  Toesies  They're growing  Every day  Can't find that  In a twit pic  Why are you avoiding  The poop stories 
[03:33:00]  What poop stories  I do poop stories  Every other day  On this show  People have poop stories  There is a lot of shit  During the episode  Yeah we talk about it  All the time  I never avoid shit  Stories  Stop avoiding the poop stories  And stop avoiding  The parents out there  Everybody's talking about  This is your parents  Segment  Everybody's talking about  Pitching and Hank Williams III  Nobody wants to talk  About shit with you  Ah because someone's  Blowing off the calls  As they come in  Well I'm not the phone screener  I see how you  I'm the host  I don't have time  To screen the calls  Talk to the parents  And their poop stories  I don't want to talk  To the parents  Or hear their poop stories 
[03:33:30]  I make the rules  That's LP  I mean if you parents  Want to  You can  Um  Everybody's talking  About pitching  Nobody's talking  About shitting  Yeah well  Whoever's screening  The phones  Is an asshole  Who's screening  The phones  Who do you think  It would be Mac  Because he's sitting there  Smiling without the headphones on  You knew in advance  Yes  And so you said that purposely  I didn't even have to look  In there to know  Oh because I thought  Maybe you knew already  That Matt was screening  The calls  So you said the phone screener 
[03:34:00]  Was an asshole  Knowing who it was  Well  By the way  A little from column A  A little from column B  I should  Yeah last week  Roland was a little bit  Of the sick day police  Okay  He ratted out  E-Rock first  For going to Conan  On his sick day  Then he went on Twitter  And on Troy's sick day  Troy was tweeting  Pictures of Central Park  Oh the concert he was at  No no no no  That was the night before  On Troy's sick day  I get  But Troy said  How do you know  Maybe I had old pictures  On my phone 
[03:34:30]  Which is fine  But he was tweeting  Some pictures of Central Park  And Roland called him out  On Twitter  And they got into  This little Twitter war  So it was like  Anytime somebody  Was doing something  That proved they might  Not be sick on a sick day  It was Roland  Who was coming to  To reveal  To you know  The powers that be  And the authorities  I need to make sure  That justice happens  Okay  Well Eric  I'm going to need  To take the role  Of that today  Because  You're the 
[03:35:00]  Eric are you the  Intern boss  Yes I am  You're the guy  Who kind of  Controls the interns  These are your guys  Uh yeah  Yeah  This Sal  Matt  Those are your interns  Sal is yes  Eric  You can't pick favorites here  I'm not picking favorites  So how is Matt  Not your intern  Matt's just here  Why is he just here  Because I've disowned him  Well you can't disown him  Then you would have to  Send him home  Oh that's true  Can we send him home  Eric don't do  Don't be cute here  Matt's your intern  Correct  I guess so  That's what I thought  Matt took a sick day 
[03:35:30]  On Friday  I remember  Because I was here  Yes  Correct  He emailed me  After the show started  Because um  He said he had a new phone  And didn't have my number  And I asked him  Well what's your new number  His phone did get robbed  Oh me sleeping in the office  He said he had a new phone  And a new number  And that uh  You know  He couldn't call me  So uh  He responded to the email  That I sent him  I said okay  What's your new number  And he gave me the number  That he had originally 
[03:36:00]  From his other phone  Well you could have a new phone  With the same number  That's fine  Well I said  What's your new number  And that's what he gave me  Do you have a new number  Or is it the same phone  Same number  It's the same number  Same number  New phone  Right  So he says it's not  Accepting calls  Right  Okay  Now here's the problem  There's just a quick question  You don't have to be  Standing by the mic  Here's the problem  Eric  Yeah  We talked about it  On the air  At the top of the show today  Yes  Eastside Dave  Former producer  For Ron and Fez  Yeah  Saturday night radio  Extraordinaire  On this channel  Davey Mack sports program

[03:38:00]  Eric you showed up  At Dave's party  Yeah but it was after  You were already there  Before I was  Right  I showed up  I came later in the night  Um  You saw Matt there  I'm assuming  Um  Not so much saw him  As  It was  As soon as I walked in  Everybody pointed to me  That Matt was over there  Yeah  Um  Why would you go to  A show related party  On a day where you  Had called out sick 
[03:38:30]  That morning  Well cause I was  Feeling better  And  You know  Davey Max  The shit  And I had to go support  His number one party  So you had to go support  The number one party  But you didn't have to support  The O.B. and Anthony show  Your number one internship  Right  Well I mean  The reason for you being here  In New York  The reason for you knowing  Any of the people there  Well don't make him feel bad guys  I mean that's true  But I  I didn't mean to be  Sick on Friday  But it happened 
[03:39:00]  But you know  I figured just because  You know  I happened to be sick  During the day  Didn't mean that  I couldn't go and support  You weren't sick  Eastside Dave  You weren't sick  You weren't sick  You were just fucking lazy  You didn't  You  What time did you wake up  On Friday  Friday  Friday  At uh  4.40  What time did you really  Wake up on Friday  5.50  5.50  Right  And then you said 
[03:39:30]  Well fuck it  I could  Be late  Right  Or  I could make up an excuse  And pretend  I woke up on time  And then I'm  Sick with diarrhea  Right  Correct  Did you go out  Last Thursday night  No  I  I reffed a hockey game  And then  I went to sleep  I got like  Two hours of sleep  I woke up  On time  To like  4.10  He didn't  No no no  He didn't have diarrhea  No not at all  That's fine  He just admitted  He wasn't sick  He woke up late 
[03:40:00]  That's why  I mean I  Don't think we need to do  Any more investigating  As to whether or not  He was actually sick  Your bowels were fine  Yeah I mean  They weren't great last week  But it's just that  You can't prove diarrhea  Right  So that's the one  We go with  Right  Right  Okay that's what I thought  And so anything else  To say about  About the matter  Then I guess  Now we know  Eric  Well  I mean I thought  You know  I was kind of afraid  Of  Eric's wrath 
[03:40:30]  You know  He's kissing Eric's ass  I don't like  No no no  He's being facetious  No no  I'm  Really I don't like  When he yells at me  And you know  He's kissing Eric's ass  He's going to yell at me a lot  And maybe fire me  So  When is  He's lying again  I'm not  Eric  Eric where are you  Where did Eric go  He's in there a minute ago  Oh no he's there  Screening calls  Oh okay no problem  Eric  What do you  What do you say  Well  Here's what 
[03:41:00]  Here's my big problem  Is that  I had emailed him  Because his phone  Kept saying  Is not accepting calls  Right now  So one  Why is your phone  Not accepting phone calls  I turn my phone off  Because you're asleep  Because  Once I  I emailed you  And said that I was sick  I figured I had to  Stick with that story  And if you call me  You might ask questions  And  You didn't have those answers  Right  I might admit something  Like I just did now  You knew your lies 
[03:41:30]  Would crumble in half a second  I mean  So you emailed  And then turned the phone off  Eric  The investigation  We're done with  I think  Matt  Would you  We're done with  The investigation part  I mean  You're a pretty  Decent investigator  We're there  Eric  Do you need to talk to him  Privately  About  Because you know  The second time  He no showed  And then he shows up  To the party  Trying to bang listeners  And wasn't the review  Last week  Yeah  Don't worry about the review  Don't worry about that  Yeah  Matt's gonna get talking too  Sorry about that Matt 
[03:42:00]  Yeah  That's alright  At least you had a good time  At the party  It was a great party  Did you get  Did you get to bang  One of the chicks  I know  You're working on  A few of them  I noticed  I  They were very aware  Of it too  I fingered one  In the bathroom  Is that a lie  No  Yes  You think it's a lie  Absolutely  I don't think  This kid's ever been  Late in his life  Do we know  Who this person is  Yes  Don't say their name  No names  Here write it  Write it on this  Give that to him  Is this gonna be 
[03:42:30]  Like the last story  Yeah  Write that name down  What is that  Let me see that  I don't know  Who this person is  Let me see it  Show it  Show it  Okay  You got another name  I don't know  If I believe  That you did that  I don't think so  No  Not buying it  Look  People  I understand  I'm reading the feedback now  And again  They're not fond of Matt  But we're just trying  To get to the bottom  Of this  I guess I'll have to 
[03:43:00]  Look up who she is  Oh  You were talking to her  And I said something  Yeah  Okay  I know who that is  Wow  At least you had a good  Friday then  I did  Well why don't you  Hit the bricks  And talk to Iraq  About what needs  To be done now  I mean  I didn't mean to  Start trouble here  But I did want to  Make sure  We were all on  The same page  Well you're a good  Investigator  Thank you very much  I mean it really  Didn't take a lot  He kind of  Buckled very quickly 
[03:43:30]  Because you saw that  Under that line of questioning  You had nothing to  That's interesting  That he's saying this  Because if you remember  We were at that table  And he brought this girl over  And introducing it to  Introducing her to everybody  Like this was his girlfriend  I  He was  He was hitting on  Most of the girls there  And he also  I noticed  You know how we make a joke  About Matt  Starving for mic time  Dave was singing  This was at  Eastside Dave's party  Dave was singing  And he had the whole band 
[03:44:00]  Set up at the end of the bar  And Matt  When Dave stopped singing  Actually went over  To that microphone  And tried to get on  And sing songs on it  It doesn't matter  Where the mic is  He's going to try  To get on it  Matt reminded me  Of when they were  Talking this morning  Opie and Anthony  They got up here  And there was  A psychopath  Down in the lobby  Opie said  And I guess  I mean I don't know  If they're actually  A psychopath  I'm assuming  I didn't get to 
[03:44:30]  Interact with them at all  But some weirdo  Was down in the lobby  Asking  I guess he wants  An internship  Yeah  And so he decided  That the best route  Would be to show up  At the building  And ask for one  Now it's always puzzled me  That people do this  I mean this guy  Showing up at the building  If you guys remember  A few years ago  We had an intern  Named Pat Duffy  Who showed up  To an event we did  And said  He would allow 
[03:45:00]  Pat from Munaki  To vomit eggnog  All over his face  And mouth  If in return  He received an internship  See that's a little  Different though  No but I mean  It's people who think  That they need to  Go out of their way  And create this  Like  Okay well  If you'll give me  This prize  I'll do something  As crazy as this  Or  I really want  This internship  I'm gonna need  To do something  As arrestable  As showing up  At Opie and Anthony's  Place of work 
[03:45:30]  Drunk  Yeah  Showing up out of the dark  As they're trying  To walk into the building  Look  If you  Apply to be  An Opie and Anthony  Intern  Listen  To the interns  That we've had  On the air  In the past  Does it really seem  Like we're that picky  I mean  Matt made it on  Love Buzz  Was an intern  Oh man  You know  Cream Pie Jones  Was here  These are not people  Oscar  Oscar  These are not people  That you listen to  Evan

[03:52:00]  Intern Matt  Do something at the Hard Rock  Do we have to  Do  I don't know  Because he's a risk  We're really not supposed  To be  Kind of making fun  Of our interns  So much on the air  I think with intern Matt  You could listen  And realize  That nobody's really  Drawing at straws here  It's just  There's so much there  That he's actually  Throwing himself to us  You've heard me  Before  Tell him get out of the studio 
[03:52:30]  I can't talk to you today  Lingers and stares at you  Because he wants to  Have this negative attention  You told him to stop  Breathing once I think  I didn't want him to  Not breathing  Breathing on mic  Very quietly in a corner  Would be fine  But I just didn't want  To hear it through my headphones  And I didn't want  My audience to hear it  Gotcha  Here on After  Hoping Anthony live  We've isolated his breathing  By the way  It's just creepy  Well I don't want to hear it  I mean this is part of it  I don't want to hear that  I don't want  Nothing about that  I've burned you  A 40 minute CD  Well you can burn it  In a fireplace then  Because I will never 
[03:53:00]  Listen to it  But you know  We're not really  They don't like it  When we give our interns  Such negative attention  Because it makes  The whole program look bad  I want you to know  Sal the intern  Fantastic  It's one of the greatest  Interns anybody could have  You've heard this stuff  When Travis fell off  The chair today  Like adult  Sal was the one  Who was able to grab  The audio real quick  Sal is scurrying around  All over the place  If you want  To work  And do work  In a real radio environment  And learn stuff  You can be a good intern here 
[03:53:30]  We have good ones too  It's just  The way the show works  Is negative attention  Pops out more often  I don't control it  It's just what happens  But I don't know  Just because  He's become such  An ongoing part of the show  Eric you as the intern boss  Do you think  You'll use him  The Hard Rock  Is going to be this  Thursday  It's November 17th  So it's like  Three days away  Or whatever  And 8am to 10am  And we're going to do  This show by the way  After Opie Nathan Live  Is going to be also 
[03:54:00]  Live from the Hard Rock  So technically  There will be live stuff  Going on from 8am  Until 11am  Are we doing a walkover?  No not live  Because it's too far away  The technology doesn't work  We'll have a little  Best of walkover thing  Going on in the meantime  But 8am to 10am  Is the show  The RSVP list is full  But we just opened up  Like a small RSVP thing  We have lots of room  So everybody needs to show up  On this Thursday  Thanks for nothing 
[03:54:30]  An Opie and Anthony  Holiday event  It's this Thursday  8am to 10am  Start showing up early  So they know  That Opie and Anthony  Means business  It'd be nice if we had a presence  And after the last live event  Was such a success  There's no reason we shouldn't  So Eric  When we do the  Hard Rock event  This Thursday  Yeah  Intern Matt  Will he be a part of it  In terms of  On the stage  Of entertaining  Yes  I think if we find something  That fits  I don't see why not  Have you thought of anything  Cause  I mean 
[03:55:00]  Public execution  I wasn't planning on  Including it  But I can come up  With something  Can we get one of those  Like  What are they called  They chop the heads off  Guillotine  Guillotine  I have one in my house  I can get it  You have a guillotine  Yeah  Is the blade sharp  Of course  Then if you could bring that in  It's fully functional  That would be great  Either that  What about a catapult  And a brick wall  Can we do that  I can get those  Okay  We'd want  Part of the big  We also need tarp  Assembling the brick wall though  The tarp would be right under it  To pick up  I guess  How humiliated  You don't want to scuff the stage  To make Matt build the brick wall 
[03:55:30]  And then fling him into it  Fling him directly into it  And by the way  There will be  Approximately  Four inches of distance  Between the catapult  And the brick wall  So it will  Literally  Just  We bring it back  And then  Just right in  Yeah we have to remember  He's not going to fly  Across the stage folks  We have to remember  Mikey is crucial  He's going to be smashed  Directly  Into that brick wall  And if it doesn't kill him  We could always just try again  I don't know  Yeah I mean  We got two hours there  Plus we'll do it  You know  And after opening Anthony Live  But um  Yeah or even 
[03:56:00]  You know what we should do  We should get one of those things  That they did back in the day  Where  It's the wooden planks  On the two by fours  That have a hole  For your head  And your hands  And you just kind of have  Oh the old  Stocks  The stocks  Yeah  Stocks  Where you have to stand there  Bent over with your neck  And your wrists  And the whole  Well they don't have to  Necessarily throw anything  For like for criminals  And those that they thought  Were possessed by the devil  Exactly  So just  Just as punishment  For  Because I think  The people would like to see it 
[03:56:30]  And uh  The audience has grown  To hate him so much  I feel like  They would enjoy  If the entire time  We were at the show  Matt was just in a stockade  And just  He just  I could  He just stayed there  I could probably get  One  Why do you have all these things  I just know weird people  Yeah you go to a lot of  Renaissance fairs  I've been to a couple  I would figure that  But now that's not  Where I know them from  Would he be facing the audience  Or do we  Put him up front  But turn him towards the back  So he can't see anything  No no no  He could face the audience  Because they'd like to see  That dumb face of his  Okay 
[03:57:00]  Let's see  Where's Travis  He's back in the office  I think  I don't know  We gotta plan some events  For this  Now I think  With the after show  I'm gonna try  Because Obi and Anthony  Our guests are gonna be signing  Yeah  So I'm gonna try to take the show  All the way up to that  And we'll see  We'll see what the  Wireless mic coverage is  But I'm gonna be  All over  That hard rock  We have a skit  I think that we're gonna be doing  I know nothing about this  A first day of Thanksgiving  A first Thanksgiving  Type of skit  Oh okay  You know how  Like a play  Exactly 
[03:57:30]  Like little kids get together  Like a pageant  A Thanksgiving pageant  Like kids get together  Originally  Okay when we were  Planning this pageant  It was just gonna be  The weirdos  Like it was gonna be  Your bobos  Your stalker patties  And stuff like that  And then we told  Obi, Anthony, and Jim  And all them about it  And Jim starts going  I wanna be in it  And Hank goes  I wanna be in it too  So we're now in the  Rewriting phase  Because we need to make it  So that we have room  For your bobos  And for your Anthony's  I think we have our  Narrator picked out 
[03:58:00]  Well we have parts  Picked out for a few people  Travis  Where are you?  I'm confused as to  What all is going on  Um  What else is going on?  I  Because we had all  These events planned  But then everything  Started changing  There's an eating contest  There is an eating  Oh that's right  There's a $500 prize  What?  That's right Paul  I'm hungry  This is what people  Don't realize  This is why  You have to go  To this event  Alright  It's on Thursday  At 8am  At the Hard Rock  Here in Times Square 
[03:58:30]  Uh  And there's gonna be  We're opening it up  We RSVP'd for a few people  Like a couple hundred  But we're gonna have like  A few hundred  Seats available  On the morning of  So you're gonna get in  Just show up  Uh  And show up early  Yeah is that chair?  Is that okay?  It's the first time  I'm sitting down  In one of these chairs  Since this morning  Uh  Travis broke a chair  Uh Eric  What a natural reaction  I gave  Oh no  Do you have Travis  Breaking a chair this morning?  Um I have the  On air  You have the isolated  Over there I believe 
[03:59:00]  It's pretty much the same  Yeah  Yeah just play  Just play the on air  I'll tell you who's happening  The minvikes  We have these chairs  That are up on swivels  Like they're tall chairs  And literally  It looked like it broke  In half pretty much  The seat part of the chair  Came off  The swivel part  So from about  I'd say  Two and a half feet  In the air  Travis  Just tumbled backwards  And said  Oh no  While he's trying 
[03:59:30]  To talk about football  When we were trying  To pull the ISO  All we heard  Was you  You hear that?  ISO  ISO  ISO  Why don't you relate  To the audience  A little bit  Nobody knows ISO  Would you just learn  That term?  Do they teach you  That term?  Two days ago  I've been using it  Every day  Do they teach you  That term when they're fishing?  You know who taught  Them that term?  Probably Sal the intern  Exactly  So what do you need  Paul?  You need me to pull the ISO?  What do you mean Sal?  I just know about  Like fishing and stuff  Yeah  That's right  So Travis  Tell me about this contest 
[04:00:00]  Which one?  There's  Oh Danny and I  Just thought of a great contest  By the way  Do you think we're  At the hard rock?  Not a chance  Yeah  No  Okay it won't happen  You guys were talking  About those things  The stockade?  Yeah  What do you think?  We thought it might be  A funny idea  To get Bobo and intern Matt  Into one of them  Like well  You know  Side by side  Side by side  Facing each other  And my idea  Which I know  This company would never approve  Would be  To have a spitting endurance contest  Just to watch them spit at each other  Where they're just both  Spitting in each other's faces 
[04:00:30]  Until one of them gives up  See that's hilarious  But I think  I do think that saliva  Might count as a bodily fluid  Like how long would you last  If Bobo's spitting in your face  I bet Matt would win that one  Because I don't think  Bobo's smart enough  To like really  Hock a loogie up  He'd just be going like  Pfft  Pfft  Pfft  Whereas Matt would be like  Really hocking loogies up  And just launching him  Into Bobo's eyeballs  I want to get this contest done  I mean I think it would be  A great thing  But do you think 
[04:01:00]  We'll be able to at least  Lock Matt up in a stockade?  I don't see why not  For all the audience  Just to see  Nobody's throwing anything at him  Nobody's  He's not  We won't even put a mic  In front of him  Would he stay there  For the entire three hours?  For the duration  Yes  That's pretty funny  I mean  Just leave him there  And no mic  No nothing  You know  I don't see why we couldn't do it  I don't have a problem with it  But I'm sure  And we could build a stockade  Can we?  I could  In three days?  I could  Yeah  Okay  Paul's on stockade duty  Just make sure he can't  Slide out of it  You understand  Yeah I'll take measurements  Of his arms 
[04:01:30]  Okay good  Let me uh  Running upstairs  Running up the flagpole  Yeah is that what they say?  Yeah  We want to lock our intern up  In a stockade  And put him on stage  What do you guys think?  You know I'll pad it for him  Just so he's not old  With what?  Uh  Sandpaper?  Yeah exactly  Fire  We'll be well-oiled  What's this  But what's actually happening  At the Hard Rock  Is definitely  The first Thanksgiving play  Yeah  Which as I was saying  Originally it was just a goof  But now Anthony and Jim  Want to be involved  Yeah now it's a big thing 
[04:02:00]  We got Anthony and Jim  And maybe some other people  Doing some other stuff  That could be good  And Eric reminded me  There's a chance  For the people  Correct who show up  At the Hard Rock  To win money  Yeah  In fact we've got  Two things going on  You don't register  Ahead of time  You just show up  And we pick audience members  Yeah we're going to pick them  You know completely on the spot  Kurt Love is looking  At his chops right now  Who the fuck is that?  He's a big fan  He's Bobo's best friend  He dated Bobo for a while  I don't know if they're  Still dating or not 
[04:02:30]  But yeah  He's just another guy  That was dating Bobo  For a little bit  So what are the two  Contests?  Well we've got two things  We're going to do  Listener karaoke  Oh we are?  Yes  We're bringing back  We haven't done karaoke  On this show in a long time  No it's been a long time  We're doing some  Listener karaoke  There might be a twist  There might not  Which you brought up  Oh okay  I haven't figured out  If we can do that yet  Technically  Not legally  Sure  So we're going to do that  There's a chance  To win some money there  Do you know how much? 
[04:03:00]  And it's in the hundreds  That's pretty good  Yeah  I mean you just  Think about it this way folks  It's a free show  You get to watch  The Opie and Anthony show  For free  The staff comedy thing  Everybody had  The greatest time  In the world  Then you go  And you meet  Opie and Anthony  Afterwards  Now  We're throwing in a chance  For you to win  A couple hundred bucks  Yeah  And you get to perform  On stage  In front of all these people  And if you don't want to sing  We've got another contest  What?  That's right  Wow  You really are good at acting  Thank you  Thank you very much  What's the second contest 
[04:03:30]  We in the spirit of Thanksgiving  Are doing a mashed potato eating contest  Bringing back the food contests  Believe it or not  This got approved  And it's definitely happening  It's not  Definitely happening  Okay  Everything is set to go  The Hard Rock is making  Mashed potatoes  We're going to be looking  For three contestants  Will  Will Pat Fumunaki be in attendance?  You know what?  I don't think he's coming  Holy shit  Oh really?  You just opened up  For a lot of people  Yeah  Bobo  Keep that belly empty 
[04:04:00]  So we're going to pick  Three people at the Hard Rock  We're looking for  Three people at the Hard Rock  When probably right around  The time we start broadcasting  You're going to come up on stage  We've got a table for you  Each contestant is going to get  Ten pounds of mashed potatoes  Okay  That seems like enough  Wow  Well we didn't want to do  Five pounds  And then watch some guy  Finish it off in an hour  Exactly  And he's still kind of hungry  Yeah  Oh so this is not like a  It's not a speed thing  Okay  So you got the entire broadcast  From eight to ten 
[04:04:30]  So it sounds like the idea is  That we're not expecting  Any of the three  To actually finish the ten pounds  It's more like  At the end of the show  At the end of the  Not the after show  At ten o'clock  Ten o'clock  We weigh  We weigh all three plates  And see who's  Who ate the most potatoes  See who ate the most potatoes  Now I mean maybe  Maybe we are  Completely underestimating our audience  And maybe ten pounds  Is doable  Well how much  But ten pounds of mashed potatoes  Is a lot  How much is  That's a lot of potatoes  And dairy  Mashed potatoes are kind of dense though 
[04:05:00]  A typical  A typical side of mashed potatoes  How much would you say that weighs  At least four pounds  You think so  I think your measurements  Might be a bit off  Eric you're an expert  How much  Would you say  A typical side of mashed potatoes weighs  Without the gravy  And the butter  Well I know we get greedy sometimes  No butter no  Just a lot of gravy  It's tough to tell  Like I thought five pounds  Was going to be alright  And then I googled  Five pounds of mashed potatoes  And it doesn't  You'd think  Alright  After a potato is mashed  It would weigh the same amount 
[04:05:30]  As before it's mashed  Right  No  It weighs more after you mash it  Well yeah  Because you don't just  Mash potatoes  And then hand them off  There's ingredients  Well like what  You just mash it  It's a potato  No  What's in mashed potatoes  Like butter  Yeah  Well we're not trying to  Hold it together  Delicious  No no no  This is  No even in general  Mashed potatoes  Really  You can't just mush up  A mashed potato  It'd be like a  Like a pile of fucking  It would be like dry play-doh  Yeah  Yeah  Thank you  Oh  So you need something  For the moisture  Yeah 
[04:06:00]  So we're going to be doing that  We're going to  Three contestants  If you want to try and win  And I've got a prize amount  For the mashed potato contest  Five hundred dollars  What  You get five hundred bucks  For eating as most  Mashed potatoes as you can  You don't even have to  Finish the mashed potatoes  You just got to eat the most  You just got to eat more  Than the guy next to you  One catch  What  You puke you're out  Ooh  That's a good catch  Because people will like  If I remember  We were talking about  You know  What Pat  Pat Duffy did  Instead of just  Applying online 
[04:06:30]  I'll tell you  He  He's going to be there  He is  Pat Duffy  Oh boy  He's experienced  In these eating contests  We don't have anything  Planned for him  But he's going to be there  Wow  He hasn't been on the show  In years  No  It's been a long time  He got in touch with me  That's good  But he would  Regurgitate on purpose  In these eating contests  Sure  Like in the eggnog contest  You know  Put the finger in the mouth  And then keep going  You're saying to me now  No regurgitation is allowed  You're out of the context  Everyone's going to have a bucket  Everyone's going to have 
[04:07:00]  A pitcher of water  Okay  Something to wash it down  Yeah  But I mean that's something  You got to be careful of  Because if you fill up on water  Yeah  Where are you going to put the potatoes  You puke you're out  You drop some mashed potatoes  In your bucket  Thinking no one's looking  You're out  You're out  No cheating  We are going to have people  Checking the buckets  Yeah  Okay  Yeah  I mean  You know  We're talking about 500 bucks here  Yeah  As a matter of fact  Maybe  Are you going to be there Paul?  Yeah  I believe I will be  Maybe since  You don't have a whole lot of uses  When we're in studio  I mean I'm just assuming  You won't have anything going on 
[04:07:30]  At the Hard Rock  Maybe what you'll do  Is just sit for the entire show  And watch those contestants  Not put potatoes  In their pictures  I wish I had known  Paul would have been doing that  Because I would have ordered him  A potato suit  Just something to wear  Yeah  Well I mean  Maybe it's not too late  Maybe we can make some kind of  Paper mache  It's totally too late  He could be a baked potato  Maybe some kind of  Paper mache something  It's way too late  I mean I gotta build  The stockade for him  Well we can take care  Of your costume 
[04:08:00]  It's not gonna be enough time  Or it could be like  When Ralph dressed up as Idaho  Sure  I got Eric laughing  Eric was up all night  Making Simpsons references  On Twitter  Midnight before a Monday show  You're making Simpsons references  With one of the Stangles  What's the matter with you  I had to go potty  Eric had to take a midnight shit  So he changed Twitter  What am I gonna do  While I'm shitting  Oh I got Twitter  Oh good line  Good place for a Simpsons reference  I'm just glad Sam got that one  I did  I was laughing this morning  When I woke up 
[04:08:30]  So listen  You're gonna wanna check out  The Hard Rock  This Thursday  November 17th  Get there before 8am  So you can get in  And maybe we'll pick you  To win 500 bucks  To eat some potatoes  Or do some karaoke  We're gonna have a whole bunch  Of stuff going on  Bob Kelly and Rich Voss  We'll talk about it more  Bob Kelly and Rich Voss  We'll both be there  So we'll be here all week  Talking about it of course  Trying to get you  We're talking you  Into the building people  That's what we're attempting to do  Stay tuned  Oh by the way  The after show  After Open Anthony Live  Was brought to you by
