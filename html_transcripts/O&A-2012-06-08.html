<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of sports betting and the hostsâ€™ unsuccessful predictions for the Celtics/Heat NBA playoffs and the Devils/Kings Stanley Cup playoffs.  Opie expressed irritation with listeners blaming him for their losses.  This segment also featured significant discussion of LeBron James's receding hairline, fueled by its trending status on Twitter.  The hosts speculated about LeBron's feelings and explored hair restoration options.

The show then shifted to a detailed recounting of Sam Roberts' wedding.  Jamie Hector, guest from the previous day, was mentioned, with Anthony sharing a humorous story of repeatedly calling him "Marlo," his character from *The Wire*, despite their personal connection.  A clip of Mayor Thomas Menino's seemingly uninformed Celtics commentary was played, reigniting the hosts' longstanding feud with the Mayor.  

Anthony detailed his jury duty experience, including a bizarre orientation film showcasing archaic justice methods.  He was ultimately excused, possibly due to perceived bias.  The conversation returned to Sam Roberts' honeymoon in Bermuda, with humorous commentary on the weather, the lack of bugs, and Sam's "bagless week" after the wedding.  Kenny Johnson was criticized for his behavior at the wedding, including complaints about seating and refusing to dance with the bride.  The hosts teased Sam about various aspects of the wedding, including the music ("God Only Knows" by The Beach Boys), vows, and overall atmosphere.

The discussion of Sam Roberts' wedding continued, detailing Kenny's running commentary (including announcing a guest's death and commenting on a nervous best man's speech), the excessively cold air conditioning, the lack of dancing amongst white guests, and the presence of several perceived celebrities (e.g., Samuel L. Jackson, David Letterman, Charlie Watts).  Anthony's bathroom breaks were mentioned, along with commentary on the food quality and humorous observations about the guests.  Opie and Anthony's competitive "check war" wedding gift was a major focus, culminating in the reveal that Opie gave the larger gift.  Other gifts were discussed, including a creatively presented $1.17 from "Chippa".  Numerous tangents emerged, including anecdotes about Sam's mother and uncle, Anthony's interactions with a bartender, a bird dropping on East Side Dave's shoe, Opie borrowing a tie, and a running joke about an intern's clumsy drink delivery.  Upcoming events and various personalities were also mentioned.  A local news story about a 97-year-old woman graduating high school concluded this segment.

The broadcast then transitioned to a discussion of the aforementioned 97-year-old high school graduate, marked by crude and sexually explicit comments from the hosts regarding her appearance and age.  Anthony's lack of a high school diploma was also addressed, prompting jokes and a caller questioning his jealousy.  The conversation then pivoted to Bob Welsh, a deceased Fleetwood Mac singer who died by suicide, with the hosts playing his music and comparing it to Steve Miller's.  A caller, Kevin, who collects air checks, initiated a tangent on Wolfman Jack, a suicide attempt, and the absurdity of air check collecting.  The latter half of this segment featured Andy Samberg as a guest promoting "That's My Boy," discussing his time on Saturday Night Live, his departure, impressions, and anecdotes from SNL.  They also discussed the movie's politically incorrect humor and nudity.  The show concluded with promotional information for upcoming Opie and Anthony live shows and Samberg's film.

[00:03:00]  come on they're an old they're an old beat-up team the black celtics so it's not that much of a  surprise that uh lebron james finally decided to play this is he put his fucking team on his back  and uh single-handedly won that game last night yeah literally yeah he was carrying the team on  his back i was still able to play how many points did he end up having because it was a blowout in  the end six he had 30 in the first half that's crazy uh 98 79 heat over the celtics we go game  seven in miami so now it's gonna be really tough for the celtics but i'm still uh pushing for the 
[00:03:30]  three three now right three fucking three that was their shot seven that was their shot celtics  at home with a three two advantage that was their shot boffston in boffston in boffston our old pal  there the mayor was literally trending i think around the world at one point it was huge and i don't know  why uh boston people don't have hondo shirts on yet the whole hondo thing hondo rondo thing you know i i  tweeted uh last night um but i think i went way too uh back in time too much yeah i tweeted just a 
[00:04:00]  picture i retweeted somebody talking about the hondo thing that uh menino did and i tweeted a  picture of hondo from the original swat see you remember the guy was hondo no you're the only one  remembers that no explanation you're the only one and i don't think anybody remembers that he was hondo  no one watched as much tv as you know i barely remember the show you remember the characters  because they always was like let's roll hondo yeah that's crazy but yeah i do want to point out one 
[00:04:30]  moment in the um celtics heat game that we were just talking about off air there was a point in the  game lebron james lost his headband yeah and all the way here in new york city as i'm watching on tv i could  feel the energy completely leave the arena up there in boston because everyone stopped applauding  cheering and they went oh my god he's really bald did he have the double headband well it's not 
[00:05:00]  officially a double headband but it's a thick headband double headband all the way and then he  had to awkwardly pick up his uh headband and put it back on his head but you could see that this guy  that's not even 30 is really losing his hair bad he should go to bosley um but like jimmy said he's  lebron fucking james so who cares but the fact you know he cares lebron james everyone cares no one  likes going bald i don't thank you i don't know there's if there's a guy out there that doesn't 
[00:05:30]  give a fuck if he starts losing his hair or goes bald and he shaved apparently he shaved his head  which is uh he shaved it down it's the comb over of the new millennium by the way he's got to just  take it off shaved head bald he's got to go completely bald because even the shave down is not  really working but it was it it was a classic moment because you're like oh my god because the  the headband thing really covers it up and it's a black headband so it almost makes it look like  it's part of his hair yeah oh and then he picked it up and you know he was like oh god everyone's 
[00:06:00]  looking at me right now and it was so bad that uh hairline was trending on twitter last night man  above all the other shit that was going on this game he was having an amazing game but what was  trending for lebron james hairline was hairline is michael jordan bald because he shaved his head  yeah he but he had some issues he's so like but but he shaved so early on that no one really was  like oh michael jordan's bald he just shaved his head there's guys man you shave it off and you just  look good dude you know how sensitive he must be about that oh it's right when your hairline is 
[00:06:30]  trending and you're 28 do you know how sensitive he must be he was having an amazing game he had 30  points in the first half so lebron 30 i believe was trending for a while but that was lower than hairline  uh and there was a couple other lebron trends that were started but hairline was the number one  you could have everything which he has he has everything he needs yeah but if that hair is  fucking falling out especially at 28 uh you're going to be very angry about it can we see his 
[00:07:00]  at mention sam on twitter is there any way to see the at mentions i'm curious just put hairline in  twitter hashtag hairline and and uh the latest ones will come up from last night that's all you have to do  and the worst part is at 28 it's very hard to do something that's going to last so he can get a  temporary fix but the rest of his hair is going to fall out even if he gets like a transplant yeah  even what did jim rome say right there uh lebron has the greatest who are you my name is sam oh hi 
[00:07:30]  sam oh you just wait patiently we'll get to you in your wedding hi mrs robert we'll get to you  in a little bit here lebron has the greatest first half of the most important game of his career  and hashtag hairline is trending above this is lebron and lbj oh that was jim rome jim rome noticed  too he hates this is there a video of him awkwardly picking up his headband it was the greatest sports  moment i've seen in months all the poor i'm not gonna say in years in months though oh the poor 
[00:08:00]  bastard yeah that's terrible so everything he could possibly want in life money fame nice house  the broads whatever he wants and uh he just doesn't want to be bald and i don't know i mean  that plug thing that you got uh they were individual follicles put in artistically in the direction your  hair grows yeah that thing not plugs plugs are so 1970s it doesn't seem to work as well with black 
[00:08:30]  guys is that true or false well i've seen some of the bosley testimonials with black guys and um  i guess if you're just thinning it's okay but uh i think if you're going completely bald with  anything i mean uh the whole bosley thing the follicles it's fine if you're thinning but if  you're completely bald you're gonna have some trouble and if you're young you could have the  follicles put in but then if the rest of your hair falls out by 30 you're just gonna have like 
[00:09:00]  you know where the transplant was put in but then the rest of your hair is gonna be gone you're gonna  look silly that'll be stupid silly you'll have a moat around yeah yeah a moat a moat around hair  moat around the fucking castle of your head or whatever yeah the castle the castle castle baldness  yeah not a good thing paul pierce has the same hairline as lebron jimmy james is saying yeah  well guess what paul pierce is about 48 years old yeah see that's different actually he started  when we were leaving boston he's been in the league 14 years so yeah whatever he's upper 30s probably if 
[00:09:30]  you start losing your hair in your upper 30s or 40s that's what's supposed to happen and it starts  thinning yeah that's what's supposed to happen i tell myself it's not that big an issue but i remember  going to high school with guys that were going completely horseshoe bald right in high school right  that's gotta suck that's not good it's like oh great i'm gonna fucking graduate and by 23  i'm gonna look like i'm 50 i swear to god and i i wish i could come up with his name so people 
[00:10:00]  could look him up i had a guy in my high school he looked like he was 32 years old at 18 really and  he pretty much had a horseshoe i mean it was thin yeah but you knew it was just a matter of time he  was gonna have a complete lower horseshoe even not not the high horseshoe low horse way low where they  lose hair in areas where you're like that i think that's impossible to lose hair down there do you  know how that affects their lives of course like that's you don't you don't just look in the mirror 
[00:10:30]  every morning when you're brushing your teeth and go yeah this is great it's great look and when we  were going to high school the you didn't have the option to shave no somehow that option came to  play but when we were growing up if you comb over if you yeah if you were going bald you either did  the comb over you had to walk around with the horrible horseshoe or just the horseshoe horrible  horseshoe oh man so uh there you go fucking game seven the heat and the celtics still pushing for  the celtics yeah yeah and rondo uh whatever hondo not rondo hondo and we're calling him hondo now

[00:19:30]  right in there when it's yours yeah i was uh of course yesterday i was called away uh from this  fine program this very pogrom uh to go to jury duty because kenny petrified me with the fact that  i would be pretty much headed for prison it was going to be like locked up abroad oh boy um if i  didn't go and report to jury duty uh i was going to be hauled away thrown in the hole fucked in the  ass and it was going to be terrible punished and then really where's the punishment after that 
[00:20:00]  goodness uh yeah then there would be problems so i i left it like i guess a quarter after seven or so  to get there by 8 30 which i did uh i don't know what's going on this was my first experience  at my age believe it or not my first experience with jury duty never went in my life uh the first  experience i sit down at the nassau county um supreme court building uh it's a giant room big  room with a bunch of uh pews i guess you'd call them like the benches and you'd see in a church 
[00:20:30]  uh big screen at the front of the uh room and they lower it down and they start the overhead projector  and go through this um uh uh little i guess orientation on jury duty but it's not orientation  it's a fucking movie you would see in in school really in like junior high was it fun at least  no it was stupid was it from the late 50s it was no it was pretty much from i guess the 80s 90s it 
[00:21:00]  looked like oh really it was the cast of 60 minutes for the time and um all dead now all dead and they  not only did they have to tell you about what it's like to be on jury duty but they went back to the  whole judicial process to the point where they literally showed actors tossing someone tied up  into a lake because when they sink they're innocent and if they float they're guilty so they have  actors doing this whole thing and i'm sitting here watching this going why am i watching this what year 
[00:21:30]  was that uh back in like the 16s yeah were you allowed to eat whatever you want before they did  the test uh well you'd get a cramp and you would i would have went for something that would make me  bloaty if you float you're innocent yes so if if they if they know if you sink you're innocent  if you float they can't even give me the fucking if i float i'm innocent they tied you up and bound  you and threw you in a lake and if you sink to the bottom you're innocent if you float on top  you're you're guilty how do they get you out of there exactly did they or no at some point that was 
[00:22:00]  up to you at some point they had the um the guys that were to determine if you were guilty or  innocent standing there and they like if you were at the bottom long enough and didn't float they  would nod and be like okay he's innocent and the family would run in like ah and try to pull the  person out because they were innocent and a bunch and sometimes they were dead this is our country  yeah this is like 1600s like which trials it was pre-country um yeah yeah let's call it pre-country 
[00:22:30]  oh before the constitution yeah we got our own problem since we made america but i think they  did it in england also i'm sure it's like the same thing so it was kind of passed over uh over to here  same group of people probably a little religious you think just a tad oh a lot of religion going  into uh that whole thing uh so that happened and then i'm sitting there and then how long was it  that movie it was uh it was probably 15 minutes uh and then like ed bradley was in it and he shows up 
[00:23:00]  and he's talking about the judicial system no one's there just because they were passing by and  said hey let me stop in for some jury duty yeah let me help it's the law you had to show up no one's  there because they want to be they threaten throwing you in jail in jail that's not that's not thank you  for your service right don't make it sound like you wanted to be there for your civic duty duty it's  too bad they can't figure out how to make it kind of where you almost want to do it the red tape  and bureaucracy that goes along with it is what makes it horrible because i knew when i sat down 
[00:23:30]  that it was going to be a long time of just sitting there because there's too much shit that goes on  there's too many people that need to be paid and justify their job uh for you to just get in and out  so you you run through a bunch of fucking channels uh with this whole thing it sucked how about you  sit in the big room and nothing happens for the first hour that's what happens you just sit in the  big room it's like okay i'm here you got me can we make this please make this easy for me i'm doing 
[00:24:00]  you a favor technically so why are you treating me like shit so right yeah and then maybe you get  into the small room where some of the action happens something happens and then that takes  forever as the lawyers are discussing shit in the hallway i've been through this i went through it  once and i said to myself i will never do this never do it again i am gonna fucking i'm gonna i'm  gonna call in a lot of favors yep yeah i i sat down and i then the guy comes in and starts talking 
[00:24:30]  he's like all right take the form and rip it down the perforations and take this part now turn it over  now fill out the questionnaire on the back and i'm like i had a flashback of fucking school because  anthony never had a pen and again i just didn't have a pen only idiots carry around pens i have a pen  every you figure it out every time you don't need your own pen so i make the mistake of looking at  the guy next to me who had a pen right and say excuse me uh sir uh when you're finished can i use 
[00:25:00]  your pen okay it was like a fucking uh an iq test this guy was taking forever and it's like maybe  eight to ten questions on the back that you just go no no yes no no sign and you're done he was  looking at everyone and pondering each question pondering a little tip you're right angrily 
[00:25:30]  yes yes they can pick up on that i was like press down really hard so i'm sitting and the guy is  still filling shit out when the guy at the front of the room is going all right we're gonna come by  now and collect the forms i'm like i haven't even fucking written anything on mine so uh i i turned  my head to see if somebody else had a pen and the woman behind me knew she must have been because what  else are you going to do there you just got to look at the drama that's happening around you of course  fucking nothing drama so she must have seen that i needed a pen and this guy was fuck taking forever 
[00:26:00]  so i looked at her and she kind of nodded at me like and and just held the pen out like all right  we see this guy's a fucking retard so and then two seconds no no yes no no sign and then the guy  comes around and uh i i give my my foreman and and then i hear uh i hear this which was great over  the loudspeaker uh will the following people please report to room four bloody bloody blah 
[00:26:30]  bloody bloody blah anthony colmia blah blah blah and i'm like oh shit i'm to report to room four  did they even have your name at that point no i just well that's why my shit i know how this story  ends but i was helping along there yeah that's key to the story that they you didn't give your name  to anyone yet no no uh and i go into room four and um apparently uh after a very quick interview 
[00:27:00]  um it was determined that i probably should not uh be on on jury duty what'd they do just bring  you into a room full of black people who booed you and then they sent you home  all you really have to do is punch up my twitter and realize it's like could you just look at my  twitter please realize i am not suited uh to make a rational i knew there was a reason you tweeted  all that decision so you worked in your favor on a guilt or or innocence or anything like that  yeah um yeah so uh i was uh i was excused from said jury duty uh the excuse for greatness for being 
[00:27:30]  a celebrity why were you excused i think i was excused because i'm a horrid person uh i am i'm racially  biased and uh i probably should not sit and judge people um because my my background with dealing  with so many of these news stories does put a bias on me i honestly and honestly i'll be honest i don't 
[00:28:00]  think i could rationally and and um on um without bias uh uh judge somebody i don't know i think that  you'd be a fair juror because you're uh you you weigh you're too analytical and i'll bet you if  you were stuck there and you had to be there and you actually saw the guy sitting there you probably  are right you you would hear that and he may be guilty you may find him guilty but i think that  you would because i think it would be like kind of not fun but interesting to weigh the evidence and 
[00:28:30]  and do it without my my horrid fucking personality so jimmy if if anthony would be a fair juror i would  be too right i would be right yeah what do you think what do you think would you be a fair juror  yeah i think you would be i wouldn't act on my emotions or anything like that no no i think that  you would try to make a good impression and uh you would do good and oh oh look at this i'm getting 
[00:29:00]  gold stars today well you try to do good there would be some major flub but i think it would be  something terrible but it would start off good right yeah with good intentions i think you'd be  a fair juror nice kenny wouldn't so basically what you're saying and you were recognized and they  said get the fuck out of here well uh the one one of the court officers were very nice uh right when  i walked in um i was like uh so it's very still it still strikes me as odd to walk up to uh somebody 
[00:29:30]  of authority in in a courtroom or an officer of the law or something and go yeah yeah i checked my  handgun i gotta check my gun because you know guns got pretty much a bad rap uh these days you brought  the gun with you well i had no choice because i was running out of time i was out of time so i had to go  and and they they have you know things for that you know it's it's it's known that you're not allowed  to carry a gun in a court building in new york state you cannot go into court that's a gun um yeah 
[00:30:00]  so uh the guy that took me back to the room the little room with all the little fucking lockers and  stuff uh he was a fan of the show big fan from as he said the old days so he remembers like any w and  stuff uh and as i was checking my my weapon um i didn't even ask him i didn't say could you get me  out of this because you know something uh but i guess he he may have taken it upon himself to 
[00:30:30]  maybe talk to some people in my uh stead and um yeah so you know i talked to people but it was it was  all legit like i i obviously was not suited for for this jury duty i i think um i'm much too cynical  these days uh to do something you know so they they were very cool though so you're good for a few  years six years apparently six years yeah uh you don't have to go to a jury duty so they end up getting 
[00:31:00]  shitty jurors in general i know i'm talking about a few people that have been on cases but i think in  general when i looked at the pool of jurors the people that are more than willing to go through  the entire process and not try to figure out a way out yeah i question those people when i looked at  that fucking jury pool it was just an abomination it's like this would you want to be judged by them  no i bet you if we got some more i never want to get into those uh shenanigans where you have to 
[00:31:30]  be judged by these people after the oj trial which was so many months that just scared everybody  like you don't have usually eight month trials yeah it's fucking scary oh my god if i had the oj  trial i would do that in a second that would be fun in hindsight for eight months i i would deal with  that hindsight then i would write a nice little book all that terrible dna evidence oh you think it  was a snore fest fucking snore fest just a snoozy stew oh my god oh my well all right well there you 
[00:32:00]  go yeah it was fun though i mean uh you know to meet some people a lot of things have been fun  recently oh oh jimmy's got something going on as such you've been just waiting to talk what do you  got you got something that was it no a lot of things have been fun lately oh hi sam sam's back

[00:34:30]  you're driving a little boat no i wasn't but i was watching the local tv or whatever and you have to  be aware of cloud formations if you don't have that technology in your boat like you start seeing  them and like ah there's gonna be trouble i gotta go back because all of a sudden the ocean gets  completely choppy and it starts downpouring and then five minutes later it's bright and sunny again  is that because of the triangle down there i don't know i didn't i didn't get sucked in by the triangle  you sure did you fly over the triangle i would think so yeah you did well the triangle might not even 
[00:35:00]  be bermuda it might just be a piece of bermuda and two other pieces they just named it after  bermuda three pieces yeah i mean it might be just a tip of the triangle but there's a shipwreck tour  what's that like you can go diving ship why didn't you go diving i didn't we didn't do anything  we're just chilling yeah i did chilling like a villain i know what sam did oh my god  what are you so excited about fucking sam went in he had a bagless week oh man bagless week we all 
[00:35:30]  know that sam uh was using uh rubbers condoms right up until he got married that that's what  happened that's right and uh now i guess i i gotta say this before we continue hot loper you're right  what kind of cunt comes back to work on a friday it's a nice you're too needy i think i'm not needy at  all it's a nice ease back into things so it's only one day and then another weekend then you get a  weekend why not just like chill you got back from bermuda i believe yesterday you just take the day 
[00:36:00]  off you just fucking hang because then i gotta wake up put up some wedding cards maybe write some thank  you notes and then start fresh on monday i gotta get used to the schedule again on monday it's easier  to just ease back into it for a day and just did you miss work at all do you i i miss it sometimes  man if i'm not here for a week i fucking i miss it i did at points but it was also like it was  amazing to just turn off my phone yeah because i didn't have any internet or phone at all do you  get itchy though uh you start itching like fuck where's my phone how do i get this phone turned 
[00:36:30]  back on a little bit at first but then i just threw the phone somewhere in the room and just left it  there i try to put my phone down but it's like uh what was that magic movie with anthony hopkins  where yeah magic magic where it's like i bet you can't go what is it a minute two minutes  without talking without talking or picking up the dummy yeah that's how i feel on my fucking phone  i'm like no i'm gonna do this you gotta do it i'm gonna do this thing just start going out and  leaving it at home oh yeah that's gonna happen you should that's gonna happen in the year 2012  because there's nothing going on like i for you but i mean i got a very full life busy important 
[00:37:00]  people you don't miss anything celebrities hey jim those times when you're away from your phone for a  while you're right you don't miss a thing what am i doing i'm just wasting time on this dumb thing  uh bermuda uh but yeah bermuda is cloud formations yeah so you flew down the day after the wedding  wait but i want to know more morning what kind of storms come in that you can't handle big rain 
[00:37:30]  storms in the ocean because it's right there on the ocean and the ocean gets really choppy but it's  cool because when you're on the island especially when you're at like the hotels by the beach you can  go and find spots where like the reefs and stuff are right there and you can just watch the waves  slamming into them it's very violent but how long of a flight it's only an hour and a half from here  yeah oh yeah it's close that's it a lot of people go to bermuda because it's great it's an hour and a  nice though it's really nice it's nicer than the bahamas really yeah and like it's not like 
[00:38:00]  you know it's it's it's clean and and it's not poor and it's not you know i gotta go to bermuda i  think i would like it's i don't know why no one goes there no one talks about bermuda right it used  to be an old school place when we were growing up like our parents would go to bermuda like if you  don't worry about the bermuda triangle if you don't want to do anything it's a good place i'm going to  turks and caicos i wonder if uh i haven't been to turks and caicos yeah no i i think bermuda is kind of  like not quite the bahamas yeah what color is the sand down there white what color is the water 
[00:38:30]  turquoise no it's not beautiful is it yeah was it warm uh no that's no that's no how cold is the  water the water was warm enough i mean once you're in the water it's how cold though it's like ocean  warm when i'm on vacation but the hotel bath water i thought i was at the chateau cumia how hot they  keep their pool was heated to you sir a toasty like 82 degrees at all times beautiful so uh so  the pool water was a lot warmer than the ocean significantly that's not good no that's not 
[00:39:00]  good the ocean should be right behind the pool water but the ocean was nice it was very refreshing  it was cold let's be honest how cold once you're i mean once you're in i don't want to hear once  you're cold enough that you're like whoo but then once you step in you're like that's nice i want the  type of water when you like you know decide you're going for a swim you don't have to like  do that whole fucking i'm i'm going in the water swim i know i hate that what you're like i'm gonna  go in slow which is the dumbest thing you should just get it over with it's not hawaii yeah it's 
[00:39:30]  not like the pacific last time you've been to hawaii when i was in sixth grade oh so you've been  there sorry fuck you showed me did you need a passport for vermina yes oh you did okay you need a  passport to go to fucking florida at this point one of the british isles yeah and they all the  accents are crazy like they're all like jess described it they all seem like they're doing  a bad british accent oh wow oh really yeah because they all have like just like a tinge of british  accent are they black uh brits down there yeah black people black brits uh those are weird 
[00:40:00]  yeah the black brits but they're not but it's not a british accent it's just like some of the words  are british because you expect them to expect them to talk ghetto yeah yeah and gets surprised  every time what yeah they don't they don't speak ebonics so you had a great uh great time down there  yeah it was really great in bermuda um we're uh we're we're guys like scoping out your your chick  they're probably looking nobody approached you wear a bikini oh yes god what color a small honeymoon 
[00:40:30]  bikini she had a teabag would she have a teabag dude it's a teabag my wife was sporting a teabag  and i gotta say something yeah to you because i know you you read uh what the the kids call the  twitter i do um a lot of people you know we made some jokes uh before your marriage about uh your  lovely wife sure uh and the compound and and all that stuff you know and it's a joke 
[00:41:00]  some people really don't know how to take the joke and like elaborate on it they just get mean  and nasty yeah well i mean they also literally read shit that was like anthony did you fuck sam's  wife yeah after the wedding no sam did by marrying her  it's very uncomfortable uh reading that and i did block some people that were uh very uh rude and  blatant yeah people people don't really understand that like and they actually thought that east side 
[00:41:30]  dave was going to literally torch my wedding light the place on fire where the fire department  would be called bodies would be brought out yeah he came and had a great time and they'd be like  dude did you hear people died at sam's wedding because uh east side dave lit the place on fire  great what's gonna happen i i i got a tweet i can't wait to see how east side dave destroys this  wedding it's not going to no and it's not a smiley face or anything like this person really  believes this is going to go down they really wanted that to happen ah whatever and you weren't 
[00:42:00]  going to have sex with my wife at my wedding how long after the wedding did you finally get to have  sex without the bag oh oh it was very soon it was after this way between the wedding and picture  taking yeah yeah after it happened you still have to say goodbye to some people at the wedding yeah  it's the other side of the bar no it was you know after the wedding and everything been that you know  not long after wedding sex because i've been there and it's been there but maybe it doesn't have the 
[00:42:30]  no that was a little different as i did that was a little after after when i got fucked but it wasn't  sex i don't know why but after wedding sex is beyond ridiculous if you actually like the person  you're it's terrific you married i guess i don't have any clue what there's some weird there's some  weird emotional thing that happened it is ridiculous yeah how good it is yes god you mean the first time  it's high um no i mean it's still good but i mean something about you just got married and have sex for 
[00:43:00]  the first time i can't even explain it why didn't i do what did day weddings pop into my head just then  and just think like some heavy ass i don't know because that's because gay weddings when they're  fucking afterwards because the one guy is fucking and he's going we won we won because they're finally  allowed to get married there's a bit more of a social celebration yeah that's true it's a little  social it's like changing the world i don't know if you guys want to hear this but it's like there's 
[00:43:30]  such a happiness to it and such a like everyone was there for you and everybody had a good time  everyone had a good time it was ridiculous how good it is those are all things that would wreck the  sex for me if there was like a lot of shame and everybody was against it and uh things didn't work  out fucking rod city i wasn't i wasn't i wasn't prepared how how unbelievable that moment was did you  cry no no nothing like that yeah but it was amazing no just pure happiness and just joy yeah the 
[00:44:00]  engagement was like that too but you're right post-marriage is when i didn't get now post-marriage  some coitus let's have some coitus i'll tell you the greatest day of my life besides like the birth  of my son because that's you got to put down its cat is its category was when i got engaged way better  than my wedding day because the wedding day is like there's so much going on you got to make sure  everyone's having a good time and you're just over the top not stressed but it's just uh intense we were 
[00:44:30]  watching uh young sam and he was having a very good time i was dancing i would not allow anyone  to not allow me to have you were dancing like a black person you think so no no no no the same  eagerness but not he was he was a white guy dancing like he wished he was black exactly exactly good  thing i didn't say thank you yes you know that wedding was good man thank you it was a great  i know it's our job to fucking beat the shit out of you and make jokes but that was a good 
[00:45:00]  fucking wedding i gotta tell you and i told you personally i said it's one of my favorite weddings  i've ever been to yeah because it wasn't in a wedding hall yeah it was in this barn it's in a barn  people thought it was the set from footloose they were like oh we got married uh in the footloose set  and i didn't feel like uh when you go to weddings like one family hangs out over here the other  family hangs out over there like it was a good group of people some great people to make fun of  yeah you gotta have that you didn't hear the show on monday did you oh no but i heard don't listen 
[00:45:30]  i i i was and we held back i was at the airport and i was just looking at tweets before i got on the  plane and i think the last tweet i read was haha sam is a beach boys faggot oh yeah and i was like okay  maybe i just turn off maybe i'll start vacation now and let them have their fun well we talked  about it it doesn't have the same emotional value just just walked to the altar to this 
[00:46:00]  song oh it was uh which was a huge surprise for you i guess yeah yeah it was always a surprise to  you by far the biggest surprise you're a very big fan of this song apparently this means something to  you and uh your lovely i've never known sam to get emotional about music about anything that would  happen thank you about anything his eyes no but what what because jess i have to say looked stunning  she really was phenomenally beautiful it's just proved how out of his league she is yeah it really 
[00:46:30]  was it was like watching a guy with one leg bat for the yankees and hit a triple  it was so irritating yes but we were all outside waiting for the wedding to start it was an outdoor  thing yeah and uh it was threatening rain but it didn't and then sand was up there it rained all  day literally and and it cleared up just in time for this outdoor ceremony it had rained all day and  at two o'clock just called me and i hadn't heard from her or talked to her at all and she called me and  she was in tears saying i don't know what to do she really wanted to get married outside and then 
[00:47:00]  her and then it started to stop raining and then her mom had this idea to do it in the parking lot  because you're supposed to get married on the grass oh boy and and the venue had never done it in the  parking lot before so we didn't know if that would work out and everything but then yeah everything  just kind of came together at the last minute so now you're standing there up at the altar your dad  is there your groomsmen and she walks out to this song yeah i didn't know that this song had any  significance i know some type of meaning what's all what's all this is uh god only knows by the beach 
[00:47:30]  boys from what year uh it was off pet sounds oh really 70s 60s 70s i don't know when pet sounds  came out when did you first hear the song i mean when i first really listened to it yeah not until  i was in college okay so why do you like it so much i don't know it's just like it's a good song man  if you can listen it's like songs have certain meanings or whatever yeah yeah that's true if you 
[00:48:00]  can listen to this song like alone and just not with nothing else going on and actually listen to  it i'll have many opportunities to do that it's incredible you do that yes i do that i have done  it here's what sam is saying if you listen to the words i'm not going to use that quote  okay so she came out that listen to the words thing goes way back listen to when i was trying 
[00:48:30]  to turn jimmy onto nirvana unplugged yeah and uh we're on our way to boston and there was a song  and i go to jimmy listen to the words man but i had said that but i had said that before all right  people of course we all said that and just didn't know if the song was going to work or not because  like she said a year ago she decided to do it and then like maybe three or four weeks ago  randomly i told her that there was when i broke up with my long-term girlfriend a few years before 
[00:49:00]  jess i was totally devastated and heartbroken and i used to listen to that song and she was like in  her head she goes oh no but she couldn't tell me that that was the plan right and so she was like  that was like a last minute call she asked her mom she asked all her friends but her using it  just completely worked and kind of redefined the whole song so now you're standing up there you're  both going to do your own vows your dad was very good he was very thank you i'd love to tease him  but he was he did a great he's an entertainer he was he loves speaking in public but he was good at 
[00:49:30]  it he was comfortable and he didn't over talk and he was very he was very good man um so then you  walk uh i mean you're up there and she comes up and you do your own vows which i thought can be  cheesy but uh it wasn't uh and she obviously was terrific hers were ridiculous they really were  great and heartfelt you guys are both great but she definitely uh destroyed my i couldn't believe  how good her vows were yeah oh my god what happened it was fucking amazing yeah vows they were 
[00:50:00]  fuck it you having to follow that it's like a little retarded child she goes my dad when we  were playing out my dad was like all right well who's gonna do the vows first and she was like  well i have to i mean i'm not gonna sam you know he's he broadcasts he speaks for a living i'm not  gonna follow sam and i go okay yeah yeah my little vows together and then i heard her vows and i was  like what the why would you do that to me and she and she had that little scrolly piece of ticker tape 
[00:50:30]  paper presentation it's slowly like like uh uh cascaded down and that was a surprise dress and  everything it looked amazing she she delivered it uh flawlessly yeah and then you're standing there  with a piece of paper like a loose leaf paper like you're giving an oral report in school your dad  handed you your vows he said he was gonna hand us both our vows and then at the last minute just 
[00:51:00]  pulled him aside and was like i have another plan don't hand me my vows but why didn't just like  show you what she figured out so then you have the same wanted the whole thing to be a scroll she  didn't tell me about the song she obviously didn't read her vows to me in advance she didn't  tell me she had a scroll ticker tape yeah it was all uh yeah all you were good jess your kindness has  made me smell smile smell you have pretty eyes too it was like billy bibbitt complimenting candy on the 
[00:51:30]  boat you got pretty hair too but no sam was very good she was uh just awesome and you want your chick  if you had to pick who who who the home run hitter was you always wanted to be your chick  yeah you don't want because that's more of a day for the woman yeah so if you had to go like her  who's yeah you wanted to be her i was much happier with people telling saying how great she was phenomenal  yeah um and but you seem like you i was like sam is gonna cry you look like you were very close to 
[00:52:00]  crying well i didn't think i was going to oh and then i saw her mom because i thought we were  leaving earlier than we did that's why he was i was just so happy that you guys had even showed up  and i saw the tears i saw the tears through your tears through your tears i started crying at the  hotel it was so funny because i was in my full suit yes and uh leaving for the venue yeah and  aunt and jim just showed up to the hotel and jim was in his black sabbath t-shirt yeah we'll see you 
[00:52:30]  over there running to their room we'll see you over there we had to go to jimmy's room yeah i had  to blow each other and then yeah real quick couple of men um saying one day there'll be us up there  but no we i changed real quick and we got there before the second bus yeah yeah ceremony earlier  than the second bus um in our limousine yeah yeah that was the other thing we had to show everybody  up i felt kind of bad that like here's you know i walk out of the hotel because we had a limo coming  for the guys and i saw this giant white limo outside the hotel must be yours and i go oh it's time 
[00:53:00]  i go guys that's i guess that's our limo and kenny goes no that's aunt's limo  a black limo that is literally half the size of yours pulls out from behind the white limo  and i go we had to get the super stretch the white limo was hiding your limo yeah  the point you want to make to everybody it had just enough room it had four seats in it for the four of  eyes oh no we should have traded limos uh you're right i could have traded limos just for the trip 
[00:53:30]  there sure hindsight's uh it's 2020 no but when i saw like jess's mom walked down the aisle crying  yes and then it just of course you would be  who's the heaven  she was crying that made you sad and i was like well it didn't make me sad it made me  emotional yeah and then uh emotional it's different it is and then yeah as the process  started it was sort of it was it was very real and emotional and i got i did i didn't cry you two 
[00:54:00]  you teared up i got a little water how long have you two been together it will be seven years seven  years the way they looked at each other when they were standing up there uh at the uh the altar uh  they were looking into each other's eyes and and giggling and laughing like they had met uh  a couple of months ago well that's how you're supposed to do it we like each other yeah see  i don't know i don't comprehend i was looking with contempt disdain and vindictiveness uh at my 
[00:54:30]  wedding speaking of but you're not supposed to go well i'm 30 i guess i'm supposed to be married  yes that's kind of what you're absolutely right you didn't have any of that did you get emotional  at your wedding oh i certainly did with regret i i had tears of regret in my eyes this was the wrong  thing it was the wrong move i knew it was just a matter of time before it would ruin my life yeah  did it yes god the only there was the only thing that was even somewhat negative about the entire 
[00:55:00]  wedding experience no club soda caddy oh oh did you hear so did you hear some things i heard a few  things oh yes he was very boisterous troy told me it started at the ceremony which you guys are  describing yeah 
[00:55:30]  he really was dressed like very good uh troy told me that as this ceremony is going on where as you're  describing me as an emotional ice block i'm getting watery eyed and you're all saying how  nice it is one voice is complaining that there weren't enough seats oh my plenty of seats because  he had to stand because he was i had a seat next to me sitting with me because my girl was in the  wedding party so i'm like kenny there's an empty seat he refused to sit down then he's entertaining the 
[00:56:00]  table instead of being present in the moment then on two occasions the bride came up to him and asked  to dance and both times he declined you wouldn't dance with the bride he said no twice oh my goodness  i'm not dancing with any broad that's not fucking me oh man what type of attitude is it to go in  with such a nice it was a nice night and when everyone was giving their speeches kenny might have had a 
[00:56:30]  a few things i heard what he said that might have been a little loud that a few tables heard  i didn't hear from my table which made me feel better because i was next to you guys but i  definitely know that there was a little rambunctious o and a corner yeah yeah you could tell that kenny  was playing but you could tell there was something going on there that table was to be watched and  troy troy filled me in on some of his remarks which i was happy that troy did by the way why  wouldn't you dance with jess he's so hot wait wait where's troy why didn't jess ask me to dance 
[00:57:00]  that's insulting yeah well i didn't get it i didn't get an invite for probably so many remarks  about you wearing white spin and pushing your bulge into people well that's too i would have been  very respectful i know i know you would have where's troy but a lot of people can't you know  differentiate troy what were some of the comments that you told sam that uh kenny had at the wedding  kenny was kenny was great i mean he he provided so much but if jess had asked you to dance you  well of course oh yeah you know yeah you gotta yeah you have to like there's there's a mix of 
[00:57:30]  like you know you you make funny comments and say funny things but then you also do some a nice  gesture yeah but troy was king of the dance floor he looked great he really was out there dancing the  chicks got wet watching him dance whoa what does that have to do with anything language what did kenny  say kenny kenny stole the show i mean you guys were great but there kenny's kenny's commentary  got me through the what were some of the comments well it started because we got there we were on the  second bus and we get there and um the late bus but we the late bus and he comes up to me he's like 
[00:58:00]  everybody had rsvp why are there people standing why is there not enough chairs and then he comes he  does a head count he goes oh my god he's counting he goes it's not what it's about like he doesn't  understand it's not about him it's not his job he could be sitting in a tree for all i care it  doesn't matter a lot of people chose to standing over one right if you had a wedding planner everybody  would have been seated we had a wedding planner not 18 people standing wow i had an empty seat next 
[00:58:30]  to me though kenny yeah there were empty seats there and there are fairness to you there were a couple  scattered singles and as i just said we moved the location of the wedding at the last possible moment  but why would you knew how many people are svp'd he did have a good point leaving less room for  chairs yeah but why would you guess what extra chairs just in case it wasn't a matter of the  number of chairs it was the location but we all we all had to stand i would like to have been  comfortable it was where the chairs would have been placed we like them there weren't enough room for 
[00:59:00]  the chairs and it was a very i'll say this it was a short ceremony yeah so even standing how long  was it 15 minutes and we weren't going to move the location to someplace that jess and i like less  to make sure that kenny can sit down for 20 minutes kenny was not even that kenny could sit  down that kenny was upset that other people couldn't sit down that 18 people that's 17 of  which didn't care i'm a very selfless person selfish no how many how many empty seats were there 
[00:59:30]  there were a few scattered singles well how about you don't have a number to provide you always have  numbers how many yeah a few oh mr exact numbers doesn't know yeah maybe it was 11. troy what else did  he do well just the commentary and then you know uh sam and jess both got choked up  and he kenny goes why are they sniffling were they doing coke  wait you forgot one what jerk remember when the maid of honor was walking too fast and i told her to 
[01:00:00]  slow down what's wrong with you and he goes he goes he goes their vows are written down they must not be  sincere that's right they went from the heart they wrote them down okay well luckily luckily there was  so much good stuff going on kenny made zero impact on the on the ceremony on the way and troy were i  know the dj's a big show of the fan but he sucked a big show of the fan yeah yeah he sucked he's a big  show of the big show of the show of the fan yeah yeah me and troy were commenting big show of the 
[01:00:30]  fan wait wait wait wait wait wait wait troy the fan salesman does troy the king of the dance floor  that means he was on the dance floor a lot because the music was good didn't like the dj i i gotta  say i thought the dj was good he was great except for the happy birthday little jimmy music from dead  people were singing no he was very good i thought he was good he was a good he did a back-to-back dead  person uh thing yeah i brought that to sam's attention donna summer i told kenny to sit down  because somebody requested it yeah oh really every time they played a song from a dead person kenny would 
[01:01:00]  come running over and go this person's dead and i'd be like okay well thanks way to bring yeah thanks  yeah bring down the uh one of the fun of the fan i don't know if you mentioned i apologize if you  mentioned this but when sam's brother was you know saying a speech or whatever oh boy and he's going  through the he's he's he's reading off a piece of paper and he pauses for a second and kenny goes  he lost his place he lost his place and our table just loses it your poor brother i felt bad for 
[01:01:30]  him because i didn't even notice from where i was sitting so i don't think my brother oh kenny was  yeah yeah yeah was your brother a little nervous hey he doesn't public speak no and he only had  notes he didn't have like you written down yeah you're on the radio and what was with the air  conditioning oh shit why are you yelling it's a microphone it was very very cold did you notice  now you were uh uh commenting i was gonna say complaining but you're commenting about the  air conditioning because it was very cold oh no he ended up complaining yes well you know why 
[01:02:00]  because people usually don't go to a wedding and just sit on their asses especially when people are  asking them to dance that is true ruined my party that is true you you asked people what an asset i was  to that party you weren't you would entertain a couple of people you entertained less less people  than were had to stand did you realize did you realize there was a solution they they open up a  door a wooden door that blocked the grill from blowing down on us the whole time but they only did it 
[01:02:30]  like two hours after we initially said that it was getting a bit chilly at the table yeah because  there's people there's a solution the people in the barn is dummy shit oh shit what happened and  sam i'm sorry i didn't get in a dance war with stanley t oh man was stanley t stanley  dan was dancing let me tell you there were probably three black people at the wedding i think that's  about right every chick was trying to dance with the black guys it was they're trying to be 
[01:03:00]  white guys were terrible at dancing you think that's how they get naughty yeah yeah who's who was  samuel l jackson that was that was uh jess's family friend who we've he signed the uh uh photo booth  book is mace windu like this yeah dude the guy looks like samuel jackson he really does right  the spitting image as they say i didn't take a photo booth picture you should have there were so  many celebrities there david letterman was there did you see him i saw david which one was david  letterman short letterman kind of old guy he looked like he looked like david letterman there were a 
[01:03:30]  couple of celebrities there charlie watts was there charlie charlie oh my god from the calves  monthly yeah i heard about that one that roaring 20s dress yeah yeah damn that's okay i but i found  an alternative bathroom in the next room i took a shit at your wedding did you oh i dropped an eight  pounder and then jimmy had to tell everybody i couldn't i was so happy with myself about the  shit he just talked wow was that good i was fucking turtling at the wedding i had to sneak 
[01:04:00]  into the other room and take a dog he was turtling i'll say this to the food once we got inside was  tremendous oh my god yeah good wedding chicken fingers fun food man i eat like a fucking pig it was  great yeah yep yeah who's the old guy with the really old guy with the walker oh probably jess's  grandfather okay why you're gonna make fun of him no no no no oh yeah well no no no no we were  standing out there and ken and he was walking because you know there was a little bit of a lip 
[01:04:30]  going down from one room to the other yeah and he was trying to get over it with his walker oh i  did see that he goes careful careful careful that's nice that's nice that that's kenny that's nice  thank you and then people were at the bar getting drinks during during the uh you know when people  were dancing and kenny just goes shh everybody's quiet careful that's kind of funny that was good  it was a good time kenny needs more joy in his life obviously no kenny's some joy some joy more 
[01:05:00]  an ounce of it yeah i think um the moment of the wedding was when jess gave you her gift  after the wedding yeah well i just don't after unprotected sex no no this was way this is way  better way better yeah he's not even wearing it he should have wore it today there's stanley t right  now stanley t right now all the mashups had a good time yeah oh wait didn't nicole just get married  wow nicole is a saturday nicole is a drunk she was yeah and i assume she's like that every 
[01:05:30]  weekend i just assume she was beyond fucking drunk i don't think she was only drinking  what do you know what else sugar high what do you mean what else would she have been i didn't think  she had come to party what does that mean what do you mean i can't he can't officially say i mean  he can officially say things about people's grandparents i don't understand why he's talking  about her why he's talking about nicole she likes she likes to party she was there to party she was 
[01:06:00]  there to have a good time i was there to have a good time too she told me to have a good time  in the same way that she did no i mean a little bit how do you know you didn't what what kind of  good time did she have which you can make that relative comparison the vagaries are just driving  me nuts well she's a party girl i'll tell you me and troy got fucked up whoa so wait what what was  the best what what was the best thing the gift oh yeah yeah yeah well it's up to sam to say man well  i mean i put it oh yeah you tweeted last night what is it exactly well i opened up uh 
[01:06:30]  i opened up this big box oh man that's not all right anthony what an asshole i am no you're not  it's perfect first there was a picture of when i was uh like 12 dressed up as gold dust the wrestler  oh and it was from halloween and then under the picture there was some paper and then i moved the  paper and jess had gotten me gold dust the wrestler's actual outfit oh like that's the 
[01:07:00]  suit that he actually wrestled in he was so excited well it's amazing why is that amazing  how do you know it's really his because that you can tell i mean first of all i know the outfit  how'd she get it from him i don't know i think i probably wait she never told you the story she  probably bought it on on ebay it's not even his it's probably just a halloween outfit why wouldn't  she tell you this is very gullible why wouldn't she tell you the story i don't think there is a  story i think she just bought it on when you have that conversation like holy shit how did you get 
[01:07:30]  this yeah she said she just said i got it i think she got it online but i can tell it's real how can  you tell it looks fake it looks fake because there's an instagram filter over it that's a mock-up  he stopped breathing when he opened up this box supposedly she bought it over a year ago and it was  in your mom's house for a while yeah oh speaking of that his mother was coming on to me why don't  you clear your throat oh wow your mom was coming on to me wow my mom bobby bobby was coming on to  you yeah this is another little kenny joke probably not sam isn't it true to say that your mother 
[01:08:00]  wanted to meet me yeah the same way exactly the same way my uncle wanted to meet jim it wasn't  sexual well i'm sorry to say that jim i know you're you didn't hear the entire conversation  oh okay so uh i met sam's mother i didn't realize i had never met her before i thought  i met your mom i convinced myself i had met her she's a very nice lady she's a lovely lady yeah  very nice she's very happy you all were there she was so happy i mean she didn't care about  can she was being wonderful the food was really good did you have the salmon i did i had the salmon 
[01:08:30]  and i had a piece of wedding cake and i had some treats what kind of wedding cake did you have  because they were different um red velvet oh i like to sing it like the song blue velvet except  they put in red i saw that yeah that's great overall uh all in all a lovely affair yes well  thank you there wasn't even the ice cream to go with the cake that is true oh  oh shit because he probably sam probably want to smell lactose farts from everybody bashing your 
[01:09:00]  wedding why would you have i there no there's no ice cream there's cake bring troy in troy oh  you got a look like out there is what you talk about ice cream there's not troy and kenny if i  found out you wanted ice cream i specifically wouldn't have had it just because of that  on my rsvp i wrote in hamburgers and hot dogs i remember what how are the wedding gifts by the  the way that you received i will tell you this oh everybody associated with the show was 
[01:09:30]  extraordinarily generous very generous all right we got you know we have to do this  you i don't i mean that's not what it's about well you are all very generous we we talked about this  even travis who wasn't at the wedding yeah i went to just his mom's house last night and there was a  nice gift from travis very nice very generous very nice eric was generous troy was generous  kenny was generous eric was dressed like a mafioso okay does that mean fat 
[01:10:00]  yes he he had that old mafia outfit the old apple in the mouth  i'm just kidding you rock you look terrific why is kenny so excited with his observations  i don't know it's creeping me out yeah so okay what was there um just that everybody was very  very generous you all chipped in oh no oh and and and by the way there was also a card yes uh we were 
[01:10:30]  opening cards and there was one card with coffee stains on it that was instead of sealed was sealed  with packaging tape and in black sharpie and by then when you shook it you could hear changing  it in black sharpie it said uh from chippa on the front of it from chippa that's right  and inside was a card the chip had signed and uh a dollar 17 in cash was in it yeah  fucking buy something what the fuck why a dollar 17 i had that's i had to budget my 
[01:11:00]  mother always told me budget stuff budget i had a dollar 17 in the wedding budget budget  she would always say that when i ate i would only eat apple sauce all right so uh although there was  a gift also from jim norton which is very generous yes um we were talking about the gifts yeah and uh  the envelopes yeah that that are given during the weddings um and me and opie were trying to 
[01:11:30]  trying to figure it out a little bit uh at the wedding oh yeah we did realize that it was a  four-digit gift okay from both of us okay oh wow really we each gave a four-digit gift okay uh but  we couldn't quite figure out so did i was you put the decimal mine was five or you're not counting the  decimal points uh i don't know 
[01:12:00]  i mean what is he getting at i don't know well we were trying to figure who was going to give  sam more i think he wants to know who won in the opie versus anthony check wars that we talked  about yes we were talking i was joking when i talked about that yeah sam put us in a tough  spot he really did i did i will only give you the results if both parties agreed to it if not  that's very rude of me i won't do that oh my god if that's something you both want to know i will 
[01:12:30]  tell you but if i don't want to know numbers no i won't give you no i just want to know why not  was one a little more than the other was one more than the other how about we answer the question  after the break oh but but before the break  that's all that's about was one more than the other ob are you comfortable with me saying whether  one was more than the other no i'm a very private guy you won't even let me say whether i mean was 
[01:13:00]  whether or not they were equal i'm extreme i'm not private was one more than the other the amounts  were not equal oh wow oh here's a fair question oh oh what was the difference i'm not going to tell  you the difference oh you're not saying who gave more or what one was no because i feel like the  difference i'm not going to tell you the difference why it's it will it becomes too big of a uh hint what is 
[01:13:30]  the difference more than what my gift was to you oh it was yes that's wow that's all but what was  your gift i don't know check but what was yours can you say sure if you don't care i don't give a  if i don't care if you say your gift oh okay i gave sam six hundred dollars cheap i mean that's  a good good wedding that is a good that is very generous that's very good we were very excited when 
[01:14:00]  we opened that envelope um sam told me to give him 700. why are you yelling and not clearing his  throat yeah that's what he told me sam told me to give him seven  or if sam should be struck by a bolt of lightning  then i'm going to blame my dry hair  sam was drinking champagne champagne cocktails hop in the sierra mountains did did anybody comment on 
[01:14:30]  that sparkling ring sam's wearing from steven singer jeweler looks very good that's enough  fucking publicity we'll mention it not for steven singer now so it does look really good okay so um  so the difference was more than that wow that's all the details i will give until both parties  both parties can say i would like to know who who is the victor now as a i'm very uncomfortable  with this i'm a very private person yeah but here it is yes i tried to read like what opie would have 
[01:15:00]  given you really thought about this i was joking why would you just give because we had talked about  i didn't talk about it at all we did all we did it was a bidding war i started the bidding war  i was joking i didn't think that anybody actually took all i'll say is i i had my number in mind  way before stupid sam trying to make this a competition and knowing that though i kind of  i think we were on the same page like i knew so i jacked mine up you did by another 500 oh wow so it 
[01:15:30]  worked sam i think i think i was probably 500 over great yeah plus all the money he'd cost you for  a limousine for the day holy shit it fucking cost me a fortune you could have he could have probably  driven himself if you want it stayed at that dump it wasn't it i don't think i'll stay at that  there was no minibar i went to jim's room and that was a suite by the way and it was no minibar 
[01:16:00]  yeah not only that i waited an hour and couldn't get lunch in that restaurant that's right yes which  kenny told everybody yeah why don't you go i tell everybody i knew on the way up via text yeah it's  terrible before he ordered i hope i don't have to wait an hour literally me and my date had to drink  water in the room there's literally uh terrible let me ask you a dozen restaurants in the area was  the difference more than oh yeah what let me see that don't don't show them i cannot betray the 
[01:16:30]  trust of sam roberts whoa wait a minute i just thought i fucking was over but i might have been  under i don't know and you know i don't know party favor oh my god did he did he go over me i'm not  going to say oh my god parties are comfortable i'm very uncomfortable oh i will say this yes to both  parties technically you have a year to give a gift so maybe that wasn't the whole gift  right troy you do have a year wow one year wow you know what the party favor was what a bottle of 
[01:17:00]  water and a cookie the cookie was good the cookie was did your mommy make those no i don't know why  i asked her about that she goes you think i'm gonna cook uh uh bake 200 fresh cookies yes the day  before a wedding actually yes and i said you should have because i didn't think the cookie  was up to par oh shit as far as bobby's right i got you good cookie not bobby's cookie oh she likes  that yeah yeah so um okay so it was okay yeah we don't need to do this yeah that's fine we don't 
[01:17:30]  have to do it oh we don't need to do this but people want to know yeah donna wants to know  dada wants to do i want to know i know you probably only cost them 24.95 a plate  per person at that wedding is just we were just talking about the food being good a minute so  annoyed he's not annoyed about anything he's just talking loudly so he doesn't fall asleep in the 
[01:18:00]  hallway these aren't real complaints he's trying to prolong this bit so he can stay on a mic because if  he goes out into the hallway he'll be asleep and he's worried about they're biting again  now this is getting personal forget about the money thing what do i gotta stay on the mic to plug my  facebook club soda kenny on facebook oh come on dude that's that's not one goes there anymore  jesus facebook i know really tickets on sale 10 o'clock today for anti-social 
[01:18:30]  no but it's not about the august 11th show right outside of chicago on sale this morning at 10 that's  not what we're talking about it's about the wedding gift so the whole staff was generous  everybody was generous yeah nobody was uh i i offered him two free tickets to foxwoods  tomorrow night as a wedding gift i didn't want to go eight o'clock show fox was mgm grant theater  was anti-social was kenny generous kenny was generous yes yes to a fault yeah i know how to spread it 
[01:19:00]  around makes me look good i know how to spread it around you are so 1950s i love it kenny was very  nice i could shake a leg out there on the dance floor he said it was great i asked kenny if he was  going to dance and he goes i saved my dancing for between the sheets he's all talk too oh he's doing 
[01:19:30]  anything all should we go to break or we have something to resolve we got he's dying to know  yeah it's driving a little bit crazy too well it was just i know we had talked about it but on the air  it was a competitive thing all i'll say is i had my number in mind did way before the wedding and way  before the i guess too jess was funny because i jacked it we were opening the cards i jacked it  we were opening the cards and everybody had a nice card and everything and then there was one  bent office envelope that obviously just had a check in it no card no nothing and she's like 
[01:20:00]  and it just said sam plus jess yeah yeah and i said and she goes what is this and i said i believe  this is ants that's pay dirt and if i know ant generally he just throws enough money at it that  it doesn't need any of it doesn't need anything i supersede the card and the sentiment with pure  cash i said generally he just throws enough money at it that you don't need any of the fancy stuff  you're not you're not annoyed that's kind of how you run your life just throw money at it it'll go 
[01:20:30]  away by the way and we open the envelope and indeed yeah everything was forgotten who cares about a card  the bartender this i i don't think we went there was a really it was a you know you had to wait in  line a little bit and the fucking guy was a dick to ant one of the bartenders really yeah and it's  i want him killed i wanted i almost felt bad for the guy i wanted to go do you know that you just  blew off the biggest tipper in the room yeah dumb motherfucker whenever i'm good for a hundred 
[01:21:00]  dollars right whenever i'm at a wedding or any like event i will go up to the bartender first  thing hand them a hundred look right into their eyes and be like i'm a racist i will say i'll be  like dude i'll be coming back a lot i just want you to you know remember me and hook me up when i come  back so a lot of times you're addicted i can be third wow that's an addiction no it's an addiction 
[01:21:30]  that's not wanting to wait online like i could be three people deep behind the bar and they'll see  you coming i get on my toes and i look at the guy and give the little point and and the eyes i go  like uh you get your eyes up and then they put the hose under the alcohol and and they point right  at me go gotcha and they will drop whatever the fuck they're doing make your goddamn drink it makes  the evening a little more pleasurable and it helps him out and likes to live the life of a 
[01:22:00]  gentleman he likes the life of riley the life of riley he doesn't want to wait in line he wants  to just be i understand like travis is my dad i live the life of riley get it i do actually it's  cute the type of guy who shows up to a limo uh to a wedding in a bigger limo than the groom  it really well i i am sorry about that i didn't know they were sending a super  you know i thought it was funny a white super it was like we were going to prom yeah you know  there's another side of that too because jess came into our room and it turned out our suite was  bigger than your suite oh her suite and she had to tell me i'm like i don't know 
[01:22:30]  they gave me biggest suite in the hotel please no we didn't ask for that i know she's like your  room is way bigger than mine oh no all right we can break yes sam just told you you had a suite oh  no oh sam lied about a suite that's what it was oh she's like why does opi's have two rooms  ours is a special suite it's the one room suite it's bigger it's better by the way the envelope that i  gave you got crumpled because it was in my it was in my suit jacket pocket right yeah along with my 
[01:23:00]  phone which i had neglected to shut off the ringer during the ceremony i heard one ringer go off so  that was yours oh it was me it rings every time there's a post on a certain mania website  updates google alerts a little m'dickin was happening and i had to do you get n-word google  alerts yes i do and the uh it started ringing but i i know what to do with an iphone in your  pocket when it rings all you got to do is like grab it and squeeze the fucking top and bottom and 
[01:23:30]  it will stop ringing so i had to do that but the the the envelope with the check was in the same  pocket again and i just crumpled it those wrinkles couldn't have bothered us last once it was open  they couldn't have mattered less you didn't mind not a bit were you mad that there was no card no  i forgot that was existing oh really yes that's a good check i didn't even write anything in the  memo section where it's like happy win matter anything it was just i might as well have been 
[01:24:00]  my lilco bill i checked the right hand side and made sure it was signed yes you're all good that's  all it needs is the signature and the amount the other moment during the uh ceremony when uh my dad  asked if anybody had any uh oh my objections or whatever he said to that to that i made eye  contact with a smiling jim did you hear did you hear so badly i didn't i didn't hear him but i was 
[01:24:30]  sure he made a sound and i just saw him smiling he did make a sound you could tell and a bird  shit on east side dave's uh shoe right they told me screaming at the top of his lungs that only there  was a bird shit only on his shoe yeah nobody else he thought it was a raindrop and it was a big  bird shit on his shoe yeah yeah all right let's go let's see all right hold on jimmy oh jimmy yes  jimmy we had um the satisfying part for me was just knowing that sam in that moment was aware had to 
[01:25:00]  think of me that was all i wanted yes in that fucking sensitive in this amazing moment yeah for  a half a second he had to part him go i know he wouldn't do it but yeah but at times will there  be a voice standing up and claiming jess is of lower stock excuse me i think we need to sit down and  like what what a beautiful bride uh just made she was phenomenal the dress was amazing she was 
[01:25:30]  just beautiful and uh and you uh 10 years from now i was saying uh when i was sitting down you will  regret that you did not uh cut your hair because you'll look at the pictures and be like i've really  fucked these pictures up yeah but i'll be like that's what i look like then no my suit was nice  wasn't it it was it was nice yes forgotten shirt even though your rent yeah exactly middle of the 
[01:26:00]  night uh day before the wedding when you should be just chilling having a good time he uh he has to  get your ass eating he jumps in a car with his boys and uh has to go all the way back to his  apartment to get his shirt and he probably stopped at every fucking rest area and did a last minute glory  whole check and then i drove from westchester back to connecticut in the sheeting rain all night  and what three three three thirty in the morning yeah we got back at like three thirty oh man did  you at least like my card i liked your card very much did it have something nice written in it 
[01:26:30]  yeah because hard i was that that's true i gave a card it was nice card  did you write anything personal yes there was some sentiment attached as well there was in mine too  sentiment digits motherfucker yeah sentiment oh i thought what sense i lost it so what what what  did you write something that you could say what you wrote it couldn't have been that i'm sure it  wasn't lovey i don't remember word for word what it was but it was nice it was nice there you go see 
[01:27:00]  it's about the card i was waiting to hear supportive in your vows i said it he did i know yeah  and i was waiting yeah and i chuckled i did chuckle but if they defended you you opened up  ants card you were like oh what the fuck there's no card and it's wrinkled i picked up the envelope  and jess is literally she was like what is like because we already opened the chip asshole the chippa  joke card yeah it was real she was like chippy even sent a card yeah she was like what is this and 
[01:27:30]  i was like wait i think this is ants because i remember you telling me it was spent and i was  like and i told her before we opened i was like you know what down don't even worry  i think he's made up for it oh i feel bad now no you do i have a year to get you get you a card  you don't have to and when you opened it up what did you say he made up for it what did she say when  she saw it oh i was like i looked at the check oh and i mean i went wide-eyed oh and then i turned  it around and said jess it's and told her the amount oh and we were both very surprised and touched 
[01:28:00]  did you like and worked well did you at least like my card oh you liked your card very very  much it was a bonus i put a stop on the check by the way that would be great especially if they  spent it like oh my god and treated themselves to new couples chickens before they had to bring them 
[01:28:30]  back how much how much uh cash did you haul in quite a bit must have been quite a bit family did  to do justice yep everybody was very generous we did uh we did a little better than we thought  really young couple just starting out you need some you need a nest egg yeah yeah that's what it's  gonna yeah it's all going into the bag i think i know the what well yeah i'm guessing oh boy  all right well i'm a very private person i know you are opie i'm not i know you aren't 
[01:29:00]  if this needs to be done for listeners then so be it but oh no i'm a very private i will not give  amounts so i will give no more information in terms of numbers than your question well i said  don't say the second number on the air oh no no second what's the one you wrote down  right i wouldn't yeah yeah oh i know what that number is yeah it was greater than that or equal  to that oh it's greater than that number oh wow it was yeah what number i could have pulled back i 
[01:29:30]  think i'm not gonna tell you i got a little overzealous with my pen yeah uh you're a young  couple just starting out yeah right anthony we get it yeah no all right so why is i wasn't i wasn't  competing with anyone i know you weren't you were just i really wasn't and it was more about the card  for you anyway yes yeah sam's kind of like family to me right yeah what's the difference whereas 
[01:30:00]  ants aren't more as a competition yeah yeah i had my number in mind asshole i am i really just have  my number in mind loving uncle and uh and i'm trying to buy friends care for you and look out for you and  aunt is like pablo escobar building a soccer stadium the uncle guides you and loves you and truly cares  for you escobar will throw money at you while destroying your neighborhood and if you cross 
[01:30:30]  him he won't stop you from being decapitated that's perfect yes can we get this over so we go to the  bathroom please do you want me to say who wins let me get we obviously should have went to break a  half hour ago yeah we're stuck in this quandary yeah go ahead and troy is still standing here  trying to figure out what the results are what does troy think who do you think won the contest  it was i guess it's a wedding gift i i definitely think it's anthony oh yeah okay well just because 
[01:31:00]  of the last minute he wanted to because you probably took a guess right i mean you sort of had a  and i a rough idea it wasn't last but i was at home i didn't do it in the in the  he was like louis trying to work out jim's father for it remember that twenty one thousand dollars  no it'll be too high if i go to 29 he'll think dirty i'll never pay it  you definitely weren't at the card store when you were trying to figure it out  no i wasn't at the card the card's very important i think it adds the sentiment the money will be 
[01:31:30]  spent but that card will always be there it's offset yes the card offset all right i do like the  you'll you'll add you'll add way more money than a card is actually worth just so you don't have to  go to the trouble of buying i didn't want to go to the card store is the difference more than  it's more than that holy shit damn it i didn't say it right no i did huh the b wow damn it the  difference is more than that oh um what kind of numbers is give me a percentage of the how is the 
[01:32:00]  difference i won't give you no no no no me this he doesn't like numbers is the difference at this  point i don't care twice is the difference twice as much as that or one and a half times as much of  that but i just showed you it's more than that more than what i think i know what the difference  is it's you're too dumb to do the math here's what okay oh now he knows you want me to tell you who won  opie yeah it's not really a competition this is a wedding gift i feel for a young couple just starting 
[01:32:30]  more people jesus christ i really fucked up that is if you won people know that is very private  you're very private you need to do this to get the break because i'm gonna pee my pants all right  sam who is it opie i need direct consent from you oh my god look at him  just give the name just i'm just gonna give the name will it will it get us to break so i can eat my  my blueberries i know my fucking cold sandwich me over so bad i gotta pee it will get us to break 
[01:33:00]  uh fine the winner was you're listening to opie anthony  sirius xm  the opie anthony  uh what donna summer's been dead for two weeks is this what this is about no  what song is this good morning sexy i don't feel like playing your sweeper today i hope okay uh 
[01:33:30]  by the way uh everyone's like pointing at me that i fucking did the cliffhanger i didn't do no  fucking cliffhanger i think i know why eric's playing this song oh why what's the name of the  song mo money mo problem by notorious vig oh so why are we playing this the anniversary of your weight  game  why are we playing this well we kind of left the audience with a cliffhanger here we don't really 
[01:34:00]  know i had nothing to do with the cliffhanger it's what you said go to break you made your good  room it was a sam erock thing i think that was erock it was all erock was it all you erock you  thought you'd be clever there for once yes it worked i think so it worked you want the results for real  look jimmy needs the results then whatever but i'm i'm a very private person i know you're very  people don't even know where i live they sure know where i live but they don't know what my house 
[01:34:30]  looks like no one knows who my friends are people assume i don't have friends you know  very private i'm probably wrong but i have what are we talking about for the new audience by the  way well we still gotta do radio you know i my wedding was over the weekend oh yeah i forgot about  that yeah no it was a great wedding but i forgot that i had mentioned during the week that we should  do check wars and find out who gives more money because sam sam wanted versus anthony sam wanted 
[01:35:00]  a bidding war yeah it's in your best interest oh absolutely but i didn't realize you guys were  going to take it seriously of course you did you're the smartest guy in the room i apparently you did i  did because uh uh anthony asked this morning who indeed won because he said he specifically raised his  value because he was competing i pulled the prices right yeah yeah i didn't ask and uh and my number  was my number going into this thing you're comfortable yeah i didn't feel like i had to 
[01:35:30]  compete or anything it is what it is it is what it is and let's also with a nice card let's not  nice card yeah now did you copy my defense i was not competing with anthony or anyone else did you did  you copy what you wrote on my card from another card i might have yeah okay i might i thought you might  have done that well um then i'll say pure guess i have what would you oh okay you want to you want  to guess before or after i already wrote my guess down okay you can't guess after that's just that's 
[01:36:00]  just repeating silly no i mean honestly do you want to announce your guess before or after after just to  see if i'm right eric do you have a guess no i don't have a guess why don't you have a guess  that's no fun troy had a guess with the money the envelopes what if somebody takes it no one's  gonna steal that here no one's gonna take it yeah troy guessed anthony eric your guess  i think anthony you think anthony oh wow oh boy anthony yeah we don't have to do this 
[01:36:30]  oh are you sure ob you don't want to do it a drum roll i'm not playing a drum roll i'm just sitting  here that's hilarious sitting here like a schmuck oh what am i a schmuck on wheels right i'm glad  opie doesn't care too much about it because he's the winner obi won wow he won holy yeah yeah yeah  yeah i know crazy i know yeah and you asked look this i wouldn't have said this is bringing too much 
[01:37:00]  attention on oh i know you don't like it i'm very uncomfortable with attention but here is my  guess obi-wan boy and i'm i'm embarrassed let's see that is my guess i know exactly what happened  that is my guess he doubled me he doubled me yeah how right am i you're right yeah really what happened  no one has told me yes wait who do you think won i got no no he guessed he guessed the amounts 
[01:37:30]  correctly wow i know what it was yes yes and you know obviously know what it was yeah i know what  it was son of a bitch right no i i guessed the amounts correctly what a lunatic my that was my  number going into it before it was before the cop yeah sam's like family man people can't figure that  out and and and stupid and to be fair obi's wife was a bridesmaid oh oh shit i never factored that  in that's not factored in oh the dog well i guess the amounts and and i'll be winning what you correct 
[01:38:00]  oh yeah okay wait you guess that i uh yeah sam didn't clarify that yes you have faith in me i i guess  he guessed the amounts per person correctly all the information is correct and that was a hundred  i didn't ask anthony i didn't ask opie i did not ask him that is correct i guessed it well done jim  thank you yes i know these guys but i'll tell you this i know that anthony's extraordinarily generous 
[01:38:30]  both extraordinarily yeah and opie that's i know extraordinarily no no no but i but i also know  that opie is nuts and he knows that this is going to come up and fucking he is not gonna i know that  it wasn't about that that was my number but let me just enjoy myself okay it was still yeah but for real  man both though we're way over the top that's unbelievable generous like unexpectedly and and  oh so i mean what happened just you guys being there was a present in and of itself yeah i can't 
[01:39:00]  believe nobody will fucking applaud me not only guess no no no no not only guessing the winner but  guessing the amounts you did that's very good you nailed the amount yes nailed it by the way to  anybody else listening i will not uh entertain requests of whether their guesses were right too  that's the end of guessing amounts oh let's keep it respect we all know what it is by the way i hope  i hope my check doesn't bounce oh boy that would probably be the greatest ending to a story ever 
[01:39:30]  which check did i use oh and i got a few accounts which one did i take it from i forget now jess just  texted me yeah oh she forgot her veil at the hotel and hero boy obie hughes went back to the hotel and  got the veil i literally just but he didn't give it to her he wore it the whole time no but that was so he 
[01:40:00]  was a hero oh you know make sure roddy b knows that i'm a hero as well you were absolutely hero  because you all said how beautiful jess looked and it wouldn't have been the same without the only uh  the only reason i'm a hero is because i'm last minute guy and i think i was literally the last  guy at the hotel well so i think i don't know i think i was the only option where did you get the  tie you were wearing from the dj all right hope he borrowed the dj's tie i have a i do have a really  nice suit yeah i forget that i throw my ties away too after i wear why do you throw stuff 
[01:40:30]  because i don't because it throws out ties what are you doing because i don't wear suits i don't  like suits but i have a nice suit i have nice shoes well the shoes i threw a dress  i don't like suits i don't wear suits i was making it better for the radio but i did have a tie and i  thought i packed my tie and i don't know where this tie is tie tie tie tie so then i finally uh get  a dress for your wedding last minute and i'm like all right all i need is the tie and i'm gonna  look pretty good i couldn't find the fucking tie so i was in a major panic so i asked the dj he goes 
[01:41:00]  i got ties yeah he had 25 of the cheesiest ties i've ever seen in my life and i picked the what i  thought was the best one out of the lot yeah and i wore it for literally an hour and then my girl's  like you don't need a tie yeah you didn't need a tie thank god because i didn't want to i didn't  want to wear it well i wanted to like look official for the ceremony and then i you know  rip off oh i gotcha right so well thank you for all the kind words and the gent and the guy goes  you can keep the time like no you can have it i don't know what i'm gonna do with your tie 
[01:41:30]  he really wanted you to keep it yeah i said put it on ebay you could get maybe seven bucks for it  because it worked which implies that the time could you keep my tie in your closet just keep  it in your closet jerry it was a shitty tie it was so well thank you all again you're very welcome  it was a great fun wedding good except for the fucking dick bag bartender well yeah uh he did you 
[01:42:00]  find another one or was it just him yeah i just went i continue i just went to the other guy yeah  here's what happened that pissed me off i know you can only get two drinks at a time sure and but  i only have two hands so that's okay that didn't bother me much so i got two drinks and then uh mr  james norton uh came up to the side of the bar and he goes anthony could you get me a diet coke 
[01:42:30]  and i'm like of course mr james norton and i said to the bartender i was like oh oh one more thing  could i have a diet coke he ignored me not he didn't hear me he heard me because i said it again  and he did this thing where he looked right over my head past me and it was like next online come on  up like to get me out of the way and get the next person online instead of pouring a fucking diet  coke for the gentleman jimmy norton that was right over at the side of the bar so he didn't have to wait 
[01:43:00]  on the long line i was standing right there he was right there and the guy was a dick bag and he was  very fucking dick baggish who the fuck are you coming in here like this wow you're just scared  i'm gonna come in here and give it to him whoa now he's talking about this wait wait wait holy  shit he's just guys he told you to come in here wow iraq straighten your fucking walk straight  your shit out i'm like who told you to come in here god damn um sal but he's during the air

[01:45:00]  bag right because i was trying to get out but they're in the middle of having a conversation oh  my god so you just drop the bag on there and it goes like that while in the middle of talking so it  throws the whole rhythm off oh my god okay so you separate the bag you gently put it in front of  them so it's nice and quiet and then you sneak out of the room not drawing any attention to yourself  and you didn't even get jim's drink  how would you not have a drink he's just going to eat it and just sit there with a 
[01:45:30]  fucking dry mouth you say jim is a notoriously thirsty person jim jim's beverage consumption  is legendary legendary how big his beverage consumption is he's dry in a moment's notice  like his women  but not like frozen frozen but just cold enough for him 
[01:46:00]  and a bottle of water and bring it back here and wait by the door say jim likes his diet cokes at  40 degrees 40 degrees check the temperature on it  oh no  sorry tell him tell him oh is he still there no he just ran off do you want to talk to him or  he's walking by let him simmer let him look at him he doesn't know what to do he's all dejected  walking down the hall this is great i love torturing these little fuckers are they gonna 
[01:46:30]  are they gonna hear the show down the hall oh yeah don't probably yeah you tell them not to say  anything to them oh well you guys can hear off the show yeah travis danny turn the show off make  him get a diet coke yeah oh at 40 degrees 40 degrees we should get the jimmy thermometer where he's got  to actually check the temperature of every beverage that goes to jimmy and it's got to be plus or minus  one degree you know each side of 40 and you got to yell at him if he checks the temperature of the  can itself because no it's the liquid it's the liquid but don't contaminate the liquid when you 
[01:47:00]  take the time you pour a little bit of smidge out pour a smidge out and then check the temperature  i've heard jim gets dry in a moment's notice  and a moment's notice since one of those women which really hurts oh jimmy  that was funny very good that's not true oh yeah they do  coming back oh is that fucking hilarious he really thought i was yelling he really thought i was yelling 
[01:47:30]  get the fuck out my my laugh i thought he heard yeah me too have him come in and and even if he places  it down really lightly just lose your shit again that it was too loud yeah again with this shit yeah  again with this shit all right so what are we talking about oh we were what yeah yeah we need  a break um what are we talking about the bartender oh the bartender bartender he was such an ass he  wouldn't give jimmy the diet coke unbelievable he's coming back and we know how he's coming about his  legendary consumption yeah but there's no reason for that when i was standing right there you were 
[01:48:00]  standing right there i know the two drink thing and it's two alcoholic beverages which you know i had in  uh each mitt but uh the third drink would have just been a diet coke and i wouldn't even have had  to have held it it's not even any sugar in it it would have been uh jimmy norton's drink so it  wasn't like i was asking for a fucking shot of jaeger with the two beverages i had by the way the  special beverage yeah was your i guess yours and uh jess's but i was special uh beverage jesus this 
[01:48:30]  fucking shit again what the fuck was that why did the door slam so loud door slams and he thuds the  fucking soda down in the middle of a goddamn break and he's smiling like passive-aggressively like  here's your soda princess do you why are you smiling what are you laughing at i have no idea do you  understand this is a fucking radio show no one told you about the door that was really loud  i mean really loud here open the door again fucking interns open the door again right are

[01:53:00]  at 40 degrees he said 40 degrees again he said 40 degrees is very important right  eight back motherfucker eight back i think go back over there and think about it again  think about it again eric's gonna be a good father oh yeah yeah you rock uh just turn around and go  it seems like you just are not into this internship are you into this what are you looking at  it's like you're not even into this internship or you're not even taking it seriously

[02:25:30]  kind of smart though because it's kind of smart because if you're going to survive it at least you  still got your face that's true nothing more awkward than the guy that walks around after  attempted suicide has half his face gone i you know i have a very positive outlook on life  this taught me a lesson i you know i wanted to kill myself but now this  it taught me that people really do care i don't have a new positive outlook oh you faceless creep you

[02:34:30]  who uh just me me and her no there was a guy that left with her or no that day yeah what was  there was the controversy jason uh yes sedakis sedakis has not announced but they don't know  why do we think he left because everyone's saying there's a rumor yeah that the three of us were all  leaving but i don't know where it came from oh okay yeah and then they were trying to read  his body language with that final show like yeah yeah yeah look at him he looks pissed off in the  background because they're not giving him any attention i'm sure he was just sad because of 
[02:35:00]  wig yeah of course yeah do you uh did you did you get a picture with mick jagger i didn't it's  amazing these guys don't do it do you get pictures with any of the guys i'm such a picture whore it's  all i would do i don't generally jimmy's crazy picture because for me i'm like i can always just  ask like the stills department at snl be like hey remember that sketch i was in with mick jagger can  i just oh okay ah see jimmy no but what if you're not in a sketch with them and so you're not like  who have you wanted to meet that you that was on the show there had to be somebody you're really  excited about um i mean the first time steve martin hosted i freaked out right for sure where i was 
[02:35:30]  like you're in the jerk great movie yeah yeah yeah i said that when i met bernadette peters oh i'm  kidding i was like i like bernadette peters i do too i was trying to figure out did you get the still  from uh the sketch with mick jagger or um you know it would be from the californians i think that  sketch we did where he's a crazy habit uh i'm sure there's a still of me i just wouldn't need that 
[02:36:00]  yeah i get them dude it was cool for me like that that farewell sketch to wig i got to sit behind  arcade fire and mick jagger yeah i was pretending to play piano back there oh you were yeah everyone's  like why are you back there i'm like i don't know maybe because i don't know did you talk to steve  martin when you first met him yeah he was very nice oh yeah yeah do you tell me you're a big fan or  do you try not to say that i was trying not to but then he was so nice he was like so what do you  did stand up right here and i was like oh yeah yeah yeah i was like just so you know i think you're the  crazy you know it's once somebody opens the door you're you come back at the floodgates 
[02:36:30]  it's hard not to when you meet people i mean i don't like daryl always said daryl hammond  somebody get a photo of somebody one time and he goes he goes aren't you in show business  i'm like first of all not on the level you are and yeah i am but it's like he's just not a picture  guy daryl doesn't care about that dude my favorite this is on topic but my favorite joke of yours is  that larry flint thing oh that thing is so funny oh yeah it's a true story too he's  fucking uh that's one of the biggest wind-ups oh my god thank you you know who's a who's a fan 
[02:37:00]  of yours uh is uh you know who carly folks is the t-mobile girl oh wow she's a big fan of yours  that's awesome i know i would be like from her twitter oh okay i i begged her into following me  uh-huh because i'm kind of like obsessed with her uh-huh and uh so now i i see all of her uh  tweets and uh she was bitching that uh so many people are leaving snl you know whoever's leaving 
[02:37:30]  and then she was like oh my god i hope you know andy sandberg doesn't leave yeah it's a big fan of  okay she's pretty pretty hot just like when you think about it technically a female yeah yeah  i don't like that new commercial though they put a helmet on her wait why you have a  fucking cute girl like that and you shove a goddamn motorcycle helmet on her face and have  her flip the fucking mask down might as well have goddamn uh uh ernest borgnine are you getting  anywhere with her that's what this is about no it's trying to i'm trying i like thinking about 
[02:38:00]  the t-mobile pr rep whose idea that was crying at home right now yeah yeah i thought the helmet was  pink dress for a while we thought we'd move on to something else and cover her adorable face  with a fucking helmet we were going to run it during sports  how come you're getting flack by the way for your you did i don't know what the sketch is but i've  read about it the uh the cannibal sketch and people going like i read some someone who really he mocked 
[02:38:30]  this that's like did i cast flack for that i didn't know oh yeah it was on some blog nothing major  on a blog okay oh they're always trying to find something that was like uh i was doing kimmel and they  shot me like a couple ideas and one of them was that and i and i was like can we add rolling gift  from find young cannibals to it and they were like yes what was the sketch i didn't see the sketch it  was like a psa saying don't eat people oh it's hilarious it's kind of seems seems kind of obvious  but apparently these days yeah yeah yeah it's a hot topic right now yeah obviously i wouldn't i 
[02:39:00]  wouldn't want it to like you know be making fun of horrible things that happen to those people but  it's crazy how many stories have come out in the last couple weeks about it yeah well the media i think  i think this shit just happens all the time but the media picks up on it because of the whole zombie  angle they want to make it seem like there's a real like people are going to go oh there are  zombies this is great i wonder if because there's so much zombie stuff if it's becoming more popular  oh maybe there's so much zombie stuff the last five years yeah what the hell let's give this a try 
[02:39:30]  i heard the cdc actually released a little memo talking about zombies they had to say that there  is no zombie invasion happening uh even though people have been eating other people they had to  put out a no a memo yes they did i know everything jimmy all right fair enough uh do you know there's  uh ammunition for guns that are zombie ammo and it's got this little green uh tip in the hollow  point uh ammo but they're selling it like hey this is great ammunition for killing zombies just in case  yeah just in case have it uh you have it for zombies like regular bullets won't work how hard 
[02:40:00]  is it on snl like uh no i'm right out of it it's like wonderful i always do that like i have a  question i want to ask him before i forget it i just shoot it out and trample everything like a  fucking amateur uh because i always hear about the creative environment it's very difficult there  because it's like you got to read in front of everybody you're sketching if it's fucking tanks  it's brutal yeah it is right yeah yeah although i've heard like horror stories about generations 
[02:40:30]  before the time that i spent there where it was way more competitive like when i showed up the the  sort of elder statesmen were like seth and polar and they're so nice it like it's a little bit corny  but i feel like my generation there was very like muppety like everyone was kind of like hey how's it  going no you're sketching so funny like there's a lot of support of each other there during my time  you know there's definitely weeks where you're like how do they not fucking do my thing you're  like throwing shit in your office but it's like once every 10 shows what's the last what's the 
[02:41:00]  last like the closest you've been canceled like or something you did was was dropped before the show  um oh dude it happens all the time where you're in like full costume oh man that close yeah ready  to go dressed like you know like an angel with a dildo on your forehead and you're like parents are  there and you're like i'm gonna get my sketch on uh five to one and then they're like cut and you're  like no that's why you see people in wacky costumes a lot of good nights because they're  like the end just about to go out in their sketch and then it gets cut it's a timing issue they just 
[02:41:30]  run out of time sometimes it's live for realsies yeah but isn't it hard as a stand-up too like i'm  always like when you're in a sketch you're trapped like you're in the fucking sketch and what do you  do i mean it sounds stupid but as comics we know how to get out of bombing you address it or you do  what you do but what do you do in a sketch when it's just it's dying like how do you yeah what is the  thoughts you're having that everyone always talks about um in the cast we always talk about  our favorite reaction to that is what will ferrell used to do which is when he'd be in a sketch that  was eating it he would just go like 10 times harder and sometimes it would actually revive 
[02:42:00]  the sketch we're like wow this is bombing and this dude is going nuts over the top yeah but you know  oftentimes it just makes it worse and you're right though i mean you're on cards it's not like you can  start like riffing or like wink at the audience and be like so this sucks shit like are you just thinking  about the audience in the studio or do you start thinking about the people watching at home all  those people when you're you're tanking i've i rarely think about the audience yeah yeah i would  perform it i feel like if you start going in that direction it freaks you out yeah yeah it probably 
[02:42:30]  would right yeah whereas like you know having done a little stand-up and i think everyone who gets in  the cast has done some sort of performance in front of live like yeah if you just focus on the like  300 people in the room that's pretty manageable yeah yeah and you feel good about it if they left  thinking hey there's millions of people watching me right now it is crazy to think about six million  people watching something crazy right yeah that's a lot of people we did one thing on the snl stage  the colin quinn show back in 2002 yeah uh there was three episodes we had it was the precursor i guess  the tough crowd it was like the town hall and it went out live from the snl stage and uh we had planned 
[02:43:00]  bits we were doing but it was me nick de paulo and uh and patrice and i remember that as we're doing our i do  mine and patrice was sitting next to me and he's in the middle of it and i just watched him  fucking drain and forget what he was oh man it was great because i i was so happy  and he just fucking forgot what he was gonna say on live television it's like man that that is 
[02:43:30]  frightening that's a lot of pressure every now and again like you'll be out there it'll be like you  know a super dense political jim downey speech you know sketch or something and like the cue card  guy will just like tilt the card a little bit oh man the light will hit it and there's glare and you  can't see the words like that's happened to me like three times where i'm like what do you like  like pretending to be rick santorum or something and being like and uh  sweater vest like you can't you can't be like card hey 
[02:44:00]  asshole wouldn't you hook up a signal like look pay attention if i do if i do that that means lift  the card up a little bit yeah i mean every now and again if you're in a tight enough shot maybe  but a lot like definitely everyone who works there at one point has to like riff a card oh wow  and amy poehler is an amazing improver i watched ucb and great improv man she's  fucking she's insanely good yeah oh god do i stink at it i go right to the dick  so what's your job i'm a fart counter i stink at that it's really hard to do 
[02:44:30]  i'm with you i've never been good at improv stuff and like their whole rules and stuff  where it's like yes and like always you know propel the thing every time i've done it someone  will be like well it's a great fine day here at the farm and i'm like that seems implausible  a farm on jupiter oh you're wrecked it i don't know we probably seems flimsy oh yeah we probably  should mention the movie i mean we have a lot to talk uh tandy about but that's my boy in theaters 
[02:45:00]  next friday right yeah big adam sandler movie it is it's a filthy filthy movie too i think you guys  will really like i was surprised that the language in the trailer yeah it's not like a typical  trailer yeah it uh it's it reminds me of like his old albums a little bit i don't know if you ever  oh yeah i absolutely did yeah he uh it's it's kind of like the the old albums and like kind of  like happy gilmore sandler but meets like a slicker more wedding crashers-y kind of a movie right i 
[02:45:30]  don't know it's been crushing in the screenings i've been to it's been really exciting that is  pretty goddamn cool he's filthy yeah it is like it's fun watching him cut loose like that because  you know the whole premise is pretty politically incorrect you know yeah child rape pretty much  like in an okay funny way right yeah well in a funny way aren't they all i mean what's what's uh  the movie about where she get the basics out there uh sandler is a in in excuse me in high school and 
[02:46:00]  has an affair with his teacher and she gets pregnant and goes to jail so he has to raise the son as a  teen and he's a terrible dad uh and then it cuts to present day and i'm the son and i've moved away  and told everyone my parents are dead because i'm like ashamed of him and it's my wedding week and he  shows up looking for money and it's chaos basically we were uh we were asking the question because we  obviously haven't seen the movie if you each learn a little something about yourself 
[02:46:30]  by the end of the film i think that might happen i'm not gonna lie to you there's a little little  slice of heart like he's he's fun spontaneous crazy guy yeah might rub off on you a little  and how about a little responsibility for dad you know what it seems like two guys moving in opposite  directions never hurt anyone that's beautiful yeah uh yeah but i will say go go see it for the last  it's insane nudity yes there is nudity oh i like that's coming back yeah are we starting to get 
[02:47:00]  the topless shots back there's boobies we went about 10 years in these comedies with no topless yeah  you uh you almost see you almost see will forte's wang oh very close to seeing his wang yeah um  so that's the kind of thing you're into sexy norton i'm not saying i want to see it you heard the  rumors too huh who am i not to look yeah we heard the rumors i started them i would hope everyone's  how do you not look at a cock if it's there i'm not gay or anything for pete's sake i'm not rude 
[02:47:30]  i don't love i don't love every movie i see but you bring up a good point yeah so i don't want to be  rude yeah i'm a good guy fucking ken which is named ken jiang right is that how you say his name  the uh oh my god yeah john oh yeah he fucking shows his dick in every movie all the time  and he just loves that's him trying to own it like you know what it's horrible  his dick just tiny single tear just ran out of his dick yeah how do you do that if you don't  have a dick i i it's unbelievable that but that's a way of owning something he's literally packing a 
[02:48:00]  half at half an inch i think yeah that's camera busting apart those stereotypes you think it's  camera tricks no no okay that's what he told people if he was like a grower but it grew to like  three feet yeah and you'd be like oh my god or or if it went from a half inch to a half and an  eighth like if it only grew like an eighth of an inch like well i'm a grower not a shower  what else is in this movie james conn i think and uh tony orlando right tony orlando james conn 
[02:48:30]  vanilla ice has all vanilla ice that's right yeah uh susan sarandon's in it uh she's still looking  all right she's looking proper y'all yeah yeah i ain't going to lie to you yeah what's the james con  james conn's pretty cool to work i have a fucking great legend fight scene with james conn  wow oh man he hit me in the face so many times jesus christ how cool is that it was the best  dude he was in free being the bean  guy who wants to be different and avoids the godfather 
[02:49:00]  that's like fucking you're like carlo then you know getting beat up by uh james conn  he uh yeah i mean i can't necessarily blame him but he kept catching me on the tip of my long  nose oh he did yeah is he one of those guys that you know could probably really fight oh dude he's  a scrapper there's a there's a scene that ended up getting cut out where we're all at a strip club  and he like wanders on stage and everyone tries to pull him off because he's he plays a father and  like a priest and uh he like went method on everybody and like they couldn't get him off the 
[02:49:30]  stage and he like everyone after the take was like fuck i'm all bruised up like he's  it does seem like one of those old bruisers we get it yeah we get into a fight in in the movie and  he starts like taking off his his shirt and stuff and like just him taking his shirt off gets a huge  laugh because he's so jacked really you're like oh my god he's gonna kill me how old is he now  he's gotta be 40. oh terrible guest guy and don't question guy don't question guy here terrible guest 
[02:50:00]  guy i would say 70 though he's gotta be 70 he's gotta be but watch what you say he'll put it on his  show ugh the worst those people so i'm starting to think so watch what you talk about he's gonna put  it on your radio show don't talk about me on stage believe me i won't you fucking dullard  yeah why would i dude i'm sorry this might just be the snl me but i genuinely enjoy terrible guest  guy i would like to see more of him yeah that is funny but he's not he's not doing it to be 
[02:50:30]  ironic he just yeah he really is really stay terrible guest honest and eager but a douche  i'm starting to think this might be an edgy comedy guys yeah  james khan you get to fight james fucking khan man that's 72 because i know people out there need  to know the answer wait who else james khan susan sarandon james khan and uh vanilla  tony orlando tony you know i've been on a fucking tony orlando kick uh really why because candia how

[02:51:30]  great man you just made me feel really happy it's like anything you want to do you're gonna have it  i got a great mustache and i'm handsome yeah you're just like all right he's an old school  entertainer man yeah tony orlando fuck yeah yeah 68 he's one of the we're doing ages today actually  when he was older you meet him and he literally starts stories me and sinatra hanging out you're  like all right forget it anything you say i want to listen to yeah dude he was a big he still works i  want to say it's the the orleans in in uh vegas or was at one point i would love to see him live he's 
[02:52:00]  one of those guys yeah every song he sings you recognize yeah he's killer i mean i didn't mention  tie yellow ribbon because that's like pack susan sarandon 66 oh really that's wow 66 what do you do  her uh what oh my god this is the second time i've worked with her and both times she's played my  mom because she was in the mother lover who was the first time rocky horror  bad guess bad guesser guy oh yeah uh what was the first time you worked with her uh on mother 
[02:52:30]  lover with timberlake on the show yeah she played my mom and he was getting all sexy with her yeah  mother lover yeah there's a there's a lot of mom sex themes in my life in my work no i kind of like  that though it's fucking i like the fact that you do ballsy stuff i mean anytime you do a sketch  about cannibalism right after while the guy while the guy is still fucking being stitched he's still  digesting yeah well he's dead yeah did the guy die the guy who got picked up no the guy's all right 
[02:53:00]  no the guy that was eating his face uh died how about the guy who got bitten up how bad is he he's  pretty fucked up he's alive the more you talk about this the less i want your endorsement yeah  that is a good point i'm endorsing and going into graphic details how many dreams were shattered that  maybe i should have thought before i did it but do you uh on a show like snl man um do you ever get  like do you ever get like annoyed like if something you want to do doesn't get on you start looking at  stuff that gets on and going like what because comics are competitive to a certain degree i know 
[02:53:30]  you said yours your era was different but doesn't that annoy you on some level if you sometimes for  sure sometimes can you bring it back in another fucking rehearsal like yeah can it bomb and you  rework it and bring it back yeah that happens a lot actually in fact like cowbell went to dress  and got cut once wow is what i'm told wow legendary but exactly so you're like well it was meant to be  with uh with walking you know yeah sometimes it's host contingent sometimes it goes well  right host is like i don't like that one i don't like what i'm doing in it or something and that's 
[02:54:00]  what gets that's gotta be frustrating because you know you probably know this gets really good but  this guy decided dude yeah like every everyone who's worked there has had something kill at the  table and then not get picked because of the host because the host or whoever is making the  decision you know where is that how it works the host like says i i for every sketch you're just the  ones that are in the loren and and whoever's head writer which is seth now and then you know like  steve higgins and the producers they go in there and they talk about it and then they bring the  host in and the host influences the decisions seth at the uh at the fucking white house correspondence 
[02:54:30]  dinner i never watched those sets yeah it was you couldn't have been funnier he killed oh my  fucking god was he great it was awesome that's what you want to just survive when you do it and have  a decent set he murdered like it was a fucking improv that would be a tough spot yeah that's a tough  spot for most comics i would assume it's every political ideology and the president and it's  like he can't be laughing at stuff that's off like wanda was great but she did uh she did like rush  limbaugh hijacker jokes which is awkward for the yeah president to have to you know did you go to that 
[02:55:00]  i was there oh you were yeah it's a clusterfuck that thing is it really there's so many people  there it's such a weird like celebrity thing now too yeah weird where you're like oh the kardashians  are here why like yeah like i shouldn't be there at all i was just there because that's my friend  but i even me walking and i was like i don't understand or know anything about politics i'm  just like gonna laugh at my buddy's jokes then you look at kardashian and realize like wow you're way  ahead of way ahead of her did you meet obama no i didn't have you met him at all no but i've met 
[02:55:30]  rahm emmanuel oh there you go right yeah yeah well yeah i kind of look at obama as a bridge to  rahm anyway i think most people do we all talk about obama but rahm is the ultimate yeah he's  trying to get to rahm yeah the rahm holder photo together is the impossible get that's that's better  than bush and obama we've asked a lot of people though have you uh met people that you do impressions  of on the uh on the show uh quite a few at this point yeah i mean i met zuckerberg and i'm friendly 
[02:56:00]  with him right the best ever was this season getting to meet nick cage oh yeah yeah i do  yeah nick cage on update i do a segment or did a segment called in the cage with nick in the cage  he came on and did it with me and it was like i saw that yeah definitely like my high point live  on that's pretty cool i was so psyched and he liked the impression yeah he was he was i think a thought  it was funny and b was excited to like come on and show that he was cool about it because right  there's so many stories about nick cage nowadays especially with the internet where everyone's 
[02:56:30]  like you know he's some crazy lunatic which is like how i play it right because that's funny but  that's what everyone thinks i think he was like to come on and sort of like ham it up and be like  and i am a normal person that understands why this is yeah we we had him on he was here and  we didn't know what to expect at first because we thought crazy nick cage is coming in you're not  going to be able to have a genuine conversation with the guy but it turned out to be really uh cool  i wish i was here that day all i would have talked about is valley girl nothing you were you lived 
[02:57:00]  and died for me with deborah forman and valley girl i want nothing else yeah but he was crazy  because he told the story of the opera thing he was at an opera i think the night before by himself  like i think he said it was like a four-hour opera yeah crying he admitted openly i was just sitting  there for four straight hours by myself crying at this opera thing he's a lover of the arts oh man  is he yeah there it is man that's why i would be crying why are you crying because i'm not the  fucking opera alone i could be doing anything but this that sounds hideous he fucking loved it 
[02:57:30]  for me i'm always just like raising arizona forget it like it's one of the best ever he's so funny in  it that is a good one i'm a huge believer in like you can't take that away kind of attitude about  people like yeah yeah like no one can ever touch that movie no matter what else he does is yeah he was  in that with uh were they play prostitutes on that was that uh uh phoenix uh what not uh river  phoenix something about a dress no what was the river phoenix movie with nick cage was that raising 
[02:58:00]  arizona uh let's say um i'm kind of confused uh we got away for i'm probably putting two things  together actually in the process totally destroying the flow of conversation self-centered need to know  something we could talk about that's my boy again as we try to get the answer yeah you guys i'm gonna  guarantee laughs yeah you're not laughing in the first five minutes it sounds like we'll give you 
[02:58:30]  your money back sailor it sounds like sandler's going back to some old school uh sandler movies  vibe you know what i mean yeah i mean a little edgier it is it is that it's i don't know man i  i watched it and laughed and was super happy that's all i can say was that my own private idaho  oh that's keanu reeves though isn't it oh is that who i'm thinking of okay i mixed up you got the  answer thank you i just kind of canary is in a cage i can i can see it though is that nick cage or  river phoenix oh we'll talk later it'll be a teaser for monday i think it's river phoenix and 
[02:59:00]  keanu reeves is that possible there you go you're probably right i want to name my kid river but  everyone said river phoenix i'm like fuck because i like that name well there's only been one  yeah but they're like why are you gonna name a kid after a dead guy yeah they still it's like  it happened yesterday that's the first that'll be the first second person named river unless you  count deep and mountain high oh wow Henry Hudson's dead yeah but he lived a long nice life he didn't  like shake to death outside the viper room rock at 20 something years old he's dead i guess yeah but 
[02:59:30]  those guys lived a life is the the point my relatives tell me oh okay yeah rock Hudson sure did live the  life oh boy did he ever all right i don't know why we're talking about he knew how to keep a  secret why not yeah you guys let's talk more about rock Hudson yeah exactly that's what we're trying to  do with hey man you got us on a friday with a half hour left of the show yeah it was a break 85  age that's what we're talking about he went to my 25 you should get you should catch us on a 
[03:00:00]  tuesday we're great yeah it's great on tuesday mcmillan and beard was yeah yeah mcmillan and beard  gave him quite a quite a beating at one point yes he certainly did by the way what made you  want to leave i'm sure you've been asked that a million times is it like is it just exhausting  what's that that's that's too busy talking to hear the joke i'm sorry a lot of characters  what uh what made you want to to go uh it was kind of like you sign up and it's seven season 
[03:00:30]  contract and i finished seven seasons i did so many digital shorts which are you know when you  do a short usually you're starting on thursday so you've already had the crazy monday tuesday  wednesday so weeks for me were very very heavy um and the guys i did them with primarily the lonely  island guys akiba and yorma have both moved on and they were nice enough to come back and help me  out with some of the shorts this year but i kind of just felt like i don't know i could i think i  could have done another year and had a great time but for whatever reason just internally inside i 
[03:01:00]  felt like it was time i can't really explain it uh but most guys sign up for seven years they you  sign a contract for seven years before you are allowed to audition for the show then if you get  it you will years yeah you're there for seven but wow the truth is if you get on there and you hate it  lauren's not going to like sue you if you write right gotcha and if and if they don't like you they  just fire you right so it's not like a binding seven-year thing what was the audition process  like did you want to go out for did they request to see you or oh i was dying to do it oh you want 
[03:01:30]  it was like my dream job since i was eight it's crazy and what happened what do they do at snl do  they do like okay they're having the auditions in october once a year it's usually over the summer so  usually like uh july august times yeah and you went in and got a call back and yeah me and my buddies  kevin yorm we were writing on the mtv movie awards when fallon hosted and he brought a bunch of snl  writers and producers with them to help out and we kind of hit it off with them and uh we had just  done a pilot for fox that had gotten passed on but we put it online and i had just done a premium blend 
[03:02:00]  for the first time and so they had stuff to kind of look at for us but jimmy and and those guys were  like we really like these guys maybe take a look so i got the call being like hey you know do you  want to audition for snl and i was like that's a pretty good call yeah but i also had like no sketch  experience other than stuff we had pre-taped and put on our website like we were always kind of like  video guys um so i had to like kind of in a week throw together an audition so i just i did a lot 
[03:02:30]  of stand-up and then like sort of patched together some weird characters and impressions but it it was  more about the jokes i made in between the stuff i did i think than the other stuff that got me what  impression did you do for the audition for lauren i did fallon um i did jimmy fallon at a funeral  oh i was still pretty happy um and i still pretty yeah it's so sad it's so sad 
[03:03:00]  how's it going man oh  which i finally got to do it on the show when he hosted oh man that's great but yeah and it was it  was also like he got me the audition so it was kind of like a yeah it was cool a wink wink or whatever  but uh i did a one word alan rickman impression which was just uh mcclain  and they're like yeah this guy's got the goods  i'm trying to think what else did you cage no i hadn't i didn't know i could do it yet i did billy 
[03:03:30]  bob thornton which was just a lot of talking about kangles kangles or kangos kangal hats oh kangal  yeah a lot of one word impressions like i tried to like get in and get out and be like that i seem  fun yeah that was good but yeah i wonder if you could do more words with those guys yeah you want  to leave them wanting more always yeah a second syllable he does the best because he sounds just 
[03:04:00]  like that guy's saying because roland's panicking behind you why oh well he's got a lot of press  today around here busy man around here all right roland he's doing a bunch of channels we're getting  the out of here anyway what time is it does he have to go wrong because you're making a lot of  gestures rolling calm down is the interview not going well it's not going well what did we do wrong  what happened oh yeah what other stuff yeah where else am i going yeah what other show is  he going even andy's asking what's so important yeah what's so important that i'm gonna act like
