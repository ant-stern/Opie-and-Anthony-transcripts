<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Muhammad Ali telling offensive jokes, which the hosts imitated and followed with their own ethnic and racial humor.  This segued into a conversation about increased FCC fines and their impact on radio content.  They recounted various outrageous radio stunts, including "Toys for Ta-Tas," the proposed (but unapproved) "Feels for Meals," and other contests involving helicopters and breast implants, comparing their own approach to other shock jocks, using derogatory terms to describe them.  They discussed how increased fines were forcing stations to tone down their programming, prompting further reminiscing about their own controversial stunts and their view of the radio industryâ€™s evolution. A listener then called in to criticize their previous discussion about a transsexual person, leading to further offensive jokes and comments on the subject. The segment concluded with a humorous, yet crude, skit about Tom Brokaw in Yellowstone National Park and a discussion of a deaf reporter specializing in disability news.

The show continued with a call from "Passive One," a pre-operative transsexual individual, who engaged in sexually suggestive and offensive banter with the hosts, culminating in Passive One showing their genitalia on camera, followed by showing self-inflicted scars from a suicide attempt. The conversation shifted to porn addiction, focusing on a man named Lance and his wife's struggles.  The hosts and callers offered frank and often crude commentary, focusing on the perceived sexual inadequacy of Lance's wife.  Discussions included taping sex, with various callers sharing personal anecdotes, including finding a parent's condoms as a child and a child interrupting a sex tape.  The "fatty pig" contest was also mentioned, with an upcoming winner announcement.

The final segment heavily focused on the "Fatty Pig" contest, offering $10 per pound to the heaviest female entrant.  The hosts discussed a Yahoo group for overweight women, using graphic and derogatory language to describe overweight individuals.  A plus-size model, Velvet, criticized the contest.  A call from Marge, who ran an animal shelter, provided a contrasting story about a dog, Bob Hope, overcoming rectal cancer. The discussion returned to the "Fatty Pig" contest, with the hosts defending it and continuing to use offensive language to describe overweight women.  Caller Kelly expressed disapproval, followed by further offensive remarks about overweight people from the hosts.

[00:03:30]  KROQ.  KROQ.  KROQ.  KROQ.  KROQ.  KROQ.  Some people don't like you to mention certain things. 
[00:04:00]  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen.  Some people are really stupid.  You're listening to the worst, not the best, the absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  Hi, Anthony.  This story hit the day we went on vacation.  So it might sound a little old for some people, but, man, we have to talk about it a little bit here. 
[00:04:30]  Parkinson's disease may have reduced his bellow to a whisper.  And what?  But Muhammad Ali's mouth can still get him in trouble.  The 59-year-old former heavyweight champ stunned a gathering in Washington when he let loose with jokes guaranteed to offend just about everybody.  Oh, equal opportunity offender.  This was an actual joke that Ali said to a crowded room.  This guy, you know, do it as Ali because I won't be able to do it.  Well, the funniest part is he can get away with anything. 
[00:05:00]  He's so pathetic now.  They had the premiere for his big movie there, Ali, with who's playing him?  Will Smith.  Will Smith.  And there's Muhammad Ali walking into the movie there, and they're all like, Ali, Ali, paparazzi, give us a pose.  I saw a guy turn around and start laughing his ass off like he looked at Ali and then had to turn around because he was laughing.  Because Ali's trying to make it look like a boxer, still holding his hands up in his ass. 
[00:05:30]  I can't.  Eek.  Oh, I guess you could say I float like a high beam.  I sting like a cotton ball.  And he's got his arms.  He can't even hold them steady.  And this guy, this little munchkin guy walking him around, it's sad because the guy used to be, I'll go, oh, I'll go get you, Joe Frazier.  I'll get you, Joe Frazier.  And now, Joe who?  You know his brain is still there, though.  Oh, is it? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  He just can't communicate what he's thinking.  I still believe it's from the decon fog on pesticide.  So he's in a crowded room in Washington, and he decides to tell a couple jokes.  Here's his first joke.  This is the God's honest truth.  Go ahead.  As Ali.  What's the difference between a Jew and a canoe?  A canoe tips.  One of the, probably one of the more classic of the anti-Semitical jokes. 
[00:06:30]  So he says this in a crowded room.  The crowd, which included a number of Jewish people, including Ali actor Ron Silver, laughed nervously.  Nervously.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But Ali wasn't through.  Here was his next joke.  A black, a Puerto Rican, and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?  The police.  And it says blacks and Hispanics in the crowd also paid Ali the courtesy of laughing. 
[00:07:00]  The courtesy.  The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove, who was at the party, reports that Ali's fourth wife, Lonnie,  tried to head off his routine as he took the mic, pleading, no, no, no, don't.  No!  Ali's rep admitted his humor was politically incorrect, but argued, these are not new jokes.  Oh.  Mohammed tells him.  I know, I understand the struggle.  Mohammed.  Old jokes.  Tells them all the time because he likes to make people laugh. 
[00:07:30]  I know, Ali.  And he shocks people to make a point.  He always manages to diffuse any situation that seems overly reverential.  Reverential.  R.  Okay.  Following the film, everybody was paying tribute to him, and he was in a good mood.  By the way, the premiere was a fundraiser for blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You want to buy a dryer, a door?  I owe my daughter money, and I'm dodging her. 
[00:08:00]  I know the struggle.  Well, the politically incorrect jokes.  I don't know.  He's a guy that could get away with it, though.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the grease man, he didn't really tell a joke, but, you know, a little off-color  remark there, and now that's it.  Yeah, well, Ali.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did some other...  Let me take the stage again.  Well, you were going to do some more jokes, but they yanked you off the stage.  What?  And we have a national radio show here.  Would you like to try some of your other jokes out on the people? 
[00:08:30]  A black guy walked into a bar with a parrot on his head.  And the bartender asked, where'd you get that?  The Paris said, Africa, they're everywhere.  I am the gravest.  Oh, God.  What do you call crime fighting in Harlem?  Uh, what?  Abortions.  What?  Abortions. 
[00:09:00]  Hey.  Ali, how's your Mercedes ride?  It's brand new.  It's only got 100,000 miles on it.  Yeah.  You notice there are no black people in the distance?  The future looks bright.  The future looks bright.  I didn't even understand the setup, Ali.  Huh?  Well, how do you fix a woman's watch? 
[00:09:30]  How?  You don't.  There's a clock on the oven.  Why?  Why is Stevie Wonder smiling all the time?  Why?  He doesn't know he's black.  Why? 
[00:10:00]  Wow, they really liked that one, Ali.  What do you call a pimple on an Italian?  Uh, what?  A grease fitting.  A lot of black people have flat noses.  Oh, wait, we heard that one.  Yeah, we heard that earlier.  Earlier.  Yeah.  Why don't Italians have freckles?  Why?  They all slide off. 
[00:10:30]  How did the Polish mother teach her son which way to put on his underwear?  How?  Yeah.  Yellow in the front, brown in the back.  Hey, what do you get when you're crossing an Italian and a Polak? 
[00:11:00]  Huh?  You got to make you an offer he can't understand.  Hey.  What does a black man get for Christmas?  What does a black man get for Christmas?  Your bicycle.  The big yellow one's the sun.  No, that's Brian Regan's bit.  The big yellow one. 
[00:11:30]  That's Brian Regan's bit, uh, Muhammad.  What, did you, did you hear about the new black French restaurant?  No, I did not.  It's called Shea what?  What, what did Lincoln say after a five, five day drunk?  I freed the who?  What, what's the, what's the definition of black foreplay? 
[00:12:00]  Huh, what?  Don't scream or I'll kill you.  How does an Italian girl shave their legs?  What, what?  I didn't, how does, what, no, I didn't understand that.  How does an Italian girl shave their legs?  Oh, shave.  They lay down outside and have someone mow them.  I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  That's right.  There's Deacon Fog on.  How do you stop a black baby from crying?  Oh, this old gang.  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's hang out Muhammad off the stage.  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  No, no, no, no, no.  Well, Pope said, Pope wrote C words.  No, that's Otto and George's joke.  Get in the coffin.  No, that's Otto and George. 
[00:13:00]  What did the two Jews say to each other?  Huh.  If we walk two more miles, we have all the oil.  What do you call a black man with no arms?  Uh, what?  Trustworthy.  What?  Well, these all, you know, but I am the gravest. 
[00:13:30]  Where's Smolder and Joe Frazier?  What do you say to a black man wearing a suit?  About what?  Will the defendant please rise?  Thank God you're black, Muhammad.  Boy, I notice an inordinate amount of black jokes.  How do you get a one-armed Polak out of a tree? 
[00:14:00]  Oh.  You wave at him.  All right, well, look at that.  Thank you, Muhammad.  Thank you.  Depends on how sliced, then you slice them.  Oh, my God.  No, don't just start doing the punchlines, man.  What's the difference between Batman and a black man? 
[00:14:30]  What?  Batman can go to the store without Robin.  They have to pick cotton to get to him.  No, no, Muhammad.  What?  What?  Because they're Negroes.  No.  What's that?  So birds don't crap on their lips. 
[00:15:00]  No, no, Muhammad.  What's that?  Thank you, Muhammad.  Eventually, the crap turns white and stops stinking.  No, thank you.  What's the problem?  Thank you.  I forgot some of the beginning.  Thank you.  Nothing.  You already told her twice.  All right, thank you.  Two in the front, two in the back, six million in the ashtray. 
[00:15:30]  Tell Mexican kids they're the pinata.  No, man.  They'll stick black Velcro to the ceiling.  You're awful, man.  Crime prevention.  No, no.  From, from the pepper spray.  No.  Behind the eyepiece of your rifle. 
[00:16:00]  Father's Day.  A tycoon.  So they don't bite their fingers when eating Tootsie Rolls.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:16:30]  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  This is John C.  This is Brian Regan.  This is Charlie Murphy.  This is Lois Griffin.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  All right, the Columbus Dispatch.  Clean Air Acts.  There's something big happened in Washington, and we're not nervous about it whatsoever. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  But there are being articles written about this all over the place.  I think the Washington Post had one that we're going to be part of.  They had one that came out a couple days ago, but then there's another one that's going to come out featuring us.  Basically, the fines have gone up drastically for radio broadcasters.  From $35,000 to $350,000.  It's important, though, because that's what you're worried about.  That gay marriage and video games is what the government should be concentrating on now.  It's a really sad day because it's ridiculous, and a lot of people go, well, the pendulum will swing in the other direction eventually. 
[00:17:30]  No, no one's going to take away these big fines, and that's why this is really, really sad for radio in general.  Not for us because we could adapt, and we'll still do edgy radio, and we still have the I don't give a F attitude, and eventually we'll get fired again.  And then you'll have some other dopey radio guy.  Slappy and Wappy, we always said.  They're getting closer to having a Slappy and Wappy show with some of the names that are out there. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  Oh, there's some other.  The Grego Show.  Grego.  Yeah, at this point, I've got to remind people that I'm not called Opie for the radio.  I've been stuck with his dumb name since I was 12.  I'm not happy that I'm now in my late 20s, and I'm still called Opie.  I just called that.  All right, I'll admit to early 30s at this point.  It was funny the day when you said, well, yeah, I'd show up, and you're like, who's this college student?  What?  Where are you showing up at the? 
[00:18:30]  At the progeria meeting?  Hey, that's funny.  I think that was pretty funny.  The beautiful part is it's funny to insightfully see how people view themselves, because they're very immature, and that's how you see yourself.  All right.  You're childlike.  So we're not reading this article because we're taking this FCC thing seriously.  We think there's some really funny stuff in this article.  This first, second paragraph.  It gives me the deuce chill.  The Columbus Dispatch.  Ohio's greatest online newspaper.  Oh, it's an online newspaper? 
[00:19:00]  We don't need to read this.  I thought people were actually reading this.  Is it really?  It's only online?  I don't know.  The Internet's pretty popular.  Clean Air Acts.  Threat of hefty FCC fines has shock jocks on best behavior.  Shock jocks.  Shocking.  Uh, well, this is going to just thin the herd, because there's a lot of hacks doing radio, and they're just known for just being shocking, and those guys will go away.  If you do the shocking stuff as attention getters, and then you give the people a show that they enjoy for the most part, then they'll stick around. 
[00:19:30]  If all you were able to do is just shock radio, you're done.  You're done.  Man cow!  Oh, you tried, didn't you, man cow?  Aw.  How did that work out for you?  No one wanted to listen to him.  No one wanted to listen to you as a political talk show host.  Sorry, you got Hannity.  Those people want to listen to Sean Hannity.  I'm listening to Hannity.  Ah, the t-shirts weren't wet, and the people giving away promotions weren't naked.  So when WVQ, WLVQ, sorry, WLVQ recently hosted a Wags and Elliot drive-by flagging, the promotion seemed downright innocent. 
[00:20:00]  Uh, what?  I think that's misspelled.  It's a drive-by fagging, because that's who you have to be to enjoy that show.  Fags and Elliot?  Yeah.  What are you giving away?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I shouldn't say that, because they probably hear that as much as we hear it, like Dopey and Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  It's a good point.  Fags and Elliot.  You wouldn't even attempt to do a Wags and Elliot drive-by flagging.  As they say, you can't out-Wags and Elliot, Wags and Elliot.  Here's the contest.  Did I say that?  Here's the contest.  Giving away food, shirts, and American flags.  After all, it's a long way from Toys for Ta-Tas, the morning show's notorious annual stunt in which strippers flash people who donated toys for poor children.  They're calling it the morning show's notorious annual stunt.  Unfortunately, that was the morning show's notorious annual stunt for about 200 morning shows across America. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  Everyone did the Toys for Ta-Tas.  I think we even did it back in the day, to be completely honest with you.  We were trying to do Feels for Meals.  Right.  But we could never get it passed by the lawyers.  Because they're calling it prostitution.  Yeah.  I still say we'll be able to do it on XM this year.  To benefit the homeless, we want to take a big refrigerator box, put a nude girl in there, and cut out holes strategically placed by her upper end. 
[00:21:30]  And the guys can reach in and grab whatever they want, you know?  And then they have to leave either food or some money for the homeless, and it's Feels for Meals.  Isn't that wonderful?  But people don't want us to help the homeless.  They call it prostitution.  Wait a minute.  I've got to read this next paragraph, which is not highlighted, but it's...  No, we're reading the whole...  Oh, you're okay.  No, go ahead, Jimmy.  Read the next paragraph.  Some of the...  This is after the donated Toys for Poor Children.  Some of the Breakfast Club contestants have been scaled down... 
[00:22:00]  Contests, contest.  I'm sorry.  Contests have been scaled down, at least on the air.  WLVQ Morning Show producer Dan Orr said recently,  When we're at Buckeye Lake, we have a tan line contest.  If we do it at all anymore, it's off the air, and we won't be talking about it on the air.  A tan line contest you can't do on the air anymore?  Why?  Wow, they really backed off.  Who's entering that?  Nuns?  Why would you have that, you f***? 
[00:22:30]  You could still do a tan line contest.  Of course.  Look at the tan lines on her back after this.  Unless the tan line starts halfway up the...  You've seen that.  Yeah.  I want to see the tan lines on Dr. Boom.  Tattered clothing pieces, patchwork tan.  Boy, Dan Orr, we won't be talking about it on the air anymore.  I didn't like the very beginning.  The Breakfast Club.  I just ignored that.  Some of the Breakfast Club contests.  Do they have a breakfast...  Is that what they call the morning show or something? 
[00:23:00]  I guess.  Because there are plenty of those around the country, too.  We want to be a franchise morning show where they have one in each city.  I want to be the Breakfast Club here.  I want to be the zoo crew.  I want to be the morning zoo.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's rough.  Madhouse.  Things are crazy going on.  Boy, that Buckeye Lake, though, sounds like a wild place.  They have tan line contests.  Here we go, guys.  Say so long to the era of outrageous radio stunts.  The article continues.  The toned-down offerings have emerged since June 15th. 
[00:23:30]  Unless it's on Lacey Peterson and Connor.  Why do you only tan line contests?  When President Bush signed into law regulations that increased tenfold to $325,000 each incident,  the maximum federal fine for indecency.  Stations have since ditched the trashy stunts.  Right.  And cautiously trotted out promotions more fitting for Sunday school groups.  Really?  Sunday school? 
[00:24:00]  For example, for example, the Grego show on WBZX.  Stop right there.  If I ever refer to myself as Grego, aren't you happy that that guy that came to you,  was at a PD early in your career and said, when you were going by the name Greg Opie Hughes,  he said, look, you got to pick something.  Yeah, that would have been Stan Mayne.  Do you think if he would have said, it could be Greg, it could be Greg Hughes, it could be Opie,  it could be Stan, or if he suggested Grego, do you think you would have mulled over Grego as a name? 
[00:24:30]  Never.  Sure you would have.  You would have done commercials, hey Grego, let go of my eggo, and you'd all laugh at it,  elbow each other's ribs.  I'd be in a hot attic right now installing air conditioning because I could never work with a Grego,  no matter how lucrative the position is.  Hello, everybody, this is Grego.  Don't forget I'll be at the gas station this weekend pumping gas for $1.02.  $1.02.  Got to get there early.  Grego.  Kill me.  Grego. 
[00:25:00]  So, the Grego show on WBZX.  Is this a hacky contest?  Because this does sound really funny and interesting if they did it.  You think the production does that?  Let go, my Grego.  Grego in the morning.  Shoes.  Shoes.  Shoes.  Legos.  WBZX.  Let go, my Grego.  The Grego show.  How many Eggos can you fit in a shoe?  Callback, anyone? 
[00:25:30]  The Grego show on WBZX won't be repeating the contest in which the winning listener has sex in a helicopter  while flying over the house of a former spouse.  I'm sure that was real.  Well, a lot of these hacky morning shows do the helicopter contest.  Another big one that morning shows do all over the country is throw your boss out of a helicopter.  Oh, yeah?  You hate your boss.  Because everyone hates their boss.  You hate your boss.  Because I said so.  Or actually, probably out of a plane, actually. 
[00:26:00]  You throw your boss out of a plane, and obviously it's a parachuting thing.  But you're so mad at the boss, and you get to...  I'm mad at him.  They do the broadcast.  He's throwing his boss out of a helicopter.  They pre-promoted...  This is crazy.  What does your boss do?  They pre-promote it for a couple of weeks, and then there's the boss with his parachute on,  and you get to push him out of the plane.  But you don't really get to push him out of the plane, because then if something did happen,  there would be an official lawsuit.  Yeah.  But you do make believe that you're pushing the boss.  He jumps? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  He jumps, and they make believe you actually pushed him out.  You hope the static line wraps around his neck?  Yeah.  Nor will WBZX return to Holiday Hooters.  Holiday Hooters.  In which the morning crew gave away breast jobs for Christmas.  Why is that bad, to give away breast jobs?  What's wrong with breast jobs?  It's because it's a hacky bit to begin with.  All right.  Do you know something?  Maybe that's just...  Maybe there's finally the hacky police, and they said, look, man, stop giving away breast  implants, please.  Thank God for the FCC's increased fines. 
[00:27:00]  That's all I can say.  Can I say this?  This is called, by the way, the Grego and Mo Show.  No, it's not.  Oh, yeah.  No, I will punch you in the face.  Uh-oh.  You cannot tell me that it is the Grego and Mo Show.  Hey, Mad Magazine feet, show the boss.  Mo gets a little...  It's a black guy and a white guy?  Yeah.  The white guy looks like James Hetfield, but bald.  Right, shaved head. 
[00:27:30]  And he's got the big Pantera guy beard on.  Yes.  What do you call a black shock jock?  Okay.  You know we can't use that word here on this.  The Grego and Mo Show.  That old gag.  What do you call a black president?  Just say...  All right.  Why wasn't Mo in the Flintstones?  I get it.  All right.  Why isn't Mo in the Jetsons?  How do you babysit Mo?  How many Mo's does it take to shingle a ring? 
[00:28:00]  What do you call a black doctor that found the cure for cancer?  Ugh, shut up.  We know that gag.  Anyway, so they're not going to do Holiday Hooters, in which the Morning Crew give away breast jobs for Christmas.  They're more likely now to focus on a community issue.  Hey, it's the Grego and Mo Show.  Hey, Mo.  A community issue.  Yes, that's just as much fun as giving away, like, stripper breasts. 
[00:28:30]  Why I...  Hey, Mo, when did you turn into an...  Holy s***, Mo's a s***.  Why I ought to...  Hey, Mo just stole my car.  It must be because now he's a s***.  Yes, I'm putting my own beeps in. 
[00:29:00]  See?  See, I can talk right over him, you...  Yes.  The beeps make it funny.  Do we have to explain this to you?  Oh, wow.  Is that good?  Look at the size of Mo's s***.  Must be because he's a s***.  Hey, Mo, you certainly do have a big, fat s***. 
[00:29:30]  S***.  Grego and Mo.  Grego.  And this is coming from me.  I'm called Opie.  Your name is ridiculous.  Oh, what bad...  Yes, Opie is saying it.  All right, continuing.  This article is just a gem.  We could do an hour on this, no problem.  Disc jockeys have become so careful that even family-oriented stations feel the heat. 
[00:30:00]  Woody Johnson, host of the WCOL morning show, Woody and the Wake Up Call,  recently said he was thinking about taking out a $500,000 insurance policy in case of an FCC fine.  Why doesn't Woody take out a gun and shoot himself?  That's why we're going to beat the crap out of every morning show in America.  Because they're all scaredy cats.  Easy with the language, Opie.  Scaredy cats.  You know what Woody should take?  We have no fear here, Woody. 
[00:30:30]  Woody should take something out of a bag in the R. Bud Dwyer tradition.  Give himself a nice braining.  Nice big 357.  Even though WCOL airs country music and Johnson is popular partly because of his wholesomeness.  Oh, boy.  He still has to worry about the unexpected, said John Crenshaw.  Like what?  That he'll say something funny or interesting?  Program director.  Program director and fellow program host? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, that's got to be a treat.  Can you imagine doing a radio show with the program director?  That would be a treat.  Hey, can we give away oatmeal?  I don't know.  The part that I find slightly scary as an on-air performer, Crenshaw said, is if I'm broadcasting live from a concert, for example,  someone in the crowd is picking up using language that would not be appropriate,  and my control room operator doesn't get to the dump button fast enough.  Well, why don't you relax? 
[00:31:30]  Sporting events are not going to exist anymore because there's audiences there, you coward?  Such a situation occurred the day after the FCC fine increase became law.  It involved the poster boys for radio stunts of questionable taste, Opie and Anthony.  See, but they get this all screwed up.  Of course they do.  As the duo did a live broadcast from the streets of New York, a Howard Stern fan shouted insults at the broadcasters.  What?  What the F did that happen?  I didn't curse.  And it wasn't on broadcast radio. 
[00:32:00]  Is he talking about the TV thing we did?  No, I think he's talking about...  When Howard had his farewell show?  Oh, live broadcast from the streets.  No, I think he's talking about when...  Wait, the live broadcast from the streets?  Insults at the broadcasters.  I think he's talking about the situation that happened recently.  Oh, with the Howard fan?  Yeah.  And by the way...  This situation.  This 93, Woody and the wake-up call, it's one guy, another guy, and a hole. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, God.  This is awful.  They all have to have a hole.  Oh, let me see.  Oh, look at it.  Oh, oh!  I'd rather get a wake-up call as a teabagging from John Merrick.  If your favorite morning show has a hole, just stop listening now.  Oh, now, Woody.  They add nothing.  Cut your losses.  Now, Woody.  Add nothing but...  Oh, stop.  Cut your losses.  Guys, now.  You know what my favorite morning show is? 
[00:33:00]  Woody and the Asian Teenager.  We'll finish the article after the break.  Woody and the Angry Ex-Wife.  Why do the pictures of...  Get it?  Yes.  Why do the pictures of radio people have to be...  Do they have to be, like, all like they're a family or married or lovers or something?  Look at this Woody and the wake-up call.  They're all laying together.  One guy has his hand on the whole shoulder. 
[00:33:30]  Like he's comforting her.  Yeah.  They're there.  Yeah, like...  And you can't see where both her arms are because the picture gets dark, so they put  the logo there.  But look at where they look like her arms are going.  I know.  Looks like it's double the pleasure, double the fun over at the Woody and the wake-up call.  Hopefully, they're on the wheels of her chair.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got to take a break.  It gets into us in this article, and that's what we're getting at here.  So, we'll continue with the article from the Columbus Dispatch after these messages. 
[00:34:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  K-Rock.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Times Square, for the people that don't know, is a really lovely place nowadays.  But the outskirts of Times Square, not so good.  Oh, yeah.  You want to explain the Port Authority to the out-of-towners there, Anthony?  Oh, it's a wonderful place where you could catch a bus.  But mostly, it's a place for the homeless to hang out and urinate.  O.B. and Anthony. 
[00:34:30]  Weekday mornings, 6 to 9.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's your...  WXRK.  New York.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  This is Stuart Copeland, and you're listening to Your Radio, the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  We got to go right to the phones.  It's Mike in Boston. 
[00:35:00]  Mike, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey there, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  Hey, I just want to say, you guys are killing me with that Larry Fine stuff.  I almost just drove off the side of the road.  You guys are killing me.  The Greggo and Mo Show.  Of course Boston would love that.  Of course.  Of course he'd love that.  You guys ruled.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mike.  By the way...  Hey, Mo killed my pregnant wife and threw her off the bridge.  Boston.  Sorry, West Palm Beach.  We're not going to explain that one. 
[00:35:30]  That was a national story.  A few years back.  All right.  By the way, I have to say, the Woody and Wake Up Call, they did a contest.  What was it?  They were giving a car away with bingo.  What?  Why don't you get on mic?  What?  Why don't you get on mic before I slap you?  They were giving a car away by doing a bingo contest.  That's what we've come down to in radio.  What kind of bingo contest?  At a used car dealership, you get to play a car to bingo, and whoever got bingo won the car. 
[00:36:00]  You're kidding, right?  Like, if you like this show, here's the word.  Can I tell you what the old bit is?  What?  Because I'm a historian, as far as radio goes.  Are you?  The bit used to be where you invite everyone to a car dealership, okay?  And there's, let's say, a hundred numbers down.  Got to touch the car and last one to take their hands off it?  Well, that one.  Okay.  No, not that one.  I was part of one of those as well.  No, this happened when the Bear Man did this in Buffalo when I was working up there.  So you got a hundred, let's call it a hundred numbers in a fenced-off area. 
[00:36:30]  And you give numbers away to all the listeners that came down.  Like, oh, I got number 12, blah, blah, blah, okay?  Corresponding key, you go in and try to start it, and the right key starts the car, you win?  Did that at WCMF many, many times.  I thought I had it.  You want to guess?  No.  One more guess?  If it's a minivan, you back it up onto a dock, and you wave goodbye as it goes a glub, a glub, a glub.  I mean, you blame Mo for it. 
[00:37:00]  So everyone has the numbers, okay?  Hey, why are they pepper spraying Mo?  Oh, it must be because he's a...  He's a what?  He's a...  What, what, what, what?  See, Tom, we know how to get around the rules.  Stupid rules.  Hey, Mo's car jacking the prize.  Holy...  Stupid rules and regs. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  So now you got the listeners there.  They all got a number.  Now you got to pick a number, and that number's going to win the car, right?  Uh-huh.  Bring in the cow.  Not cow bingo.  Bring in the cow.  What's cow bingo?  All right.  But then they bring the cow in.  Now I know.  All the numbers are laid out flat.  Right.  Right.  I said that.  And the cow walks around.  And does what it has to do.  And whatever it lands on, that number wins the car. 
[00:38:00]  And what the cow pie bingo, it's called, yeah.  When the cow pie lands on a number, the corresponding number.  I was such a nobody in this business, I had to do the research for that promotion, and I  had to figure out how long it takes a cow to do what it has to do.  From eating to full digestion.  And it turns out they are pretty much doing what they have to do pretty much every minute.  That's all day long.  That's why we slaughter them. 
[00:38:30]  That's what sucked about.  Take tasty burgers out of them.  That's what sucked about the contest, because then you got a handler that walks the cow around.  Mm-hmm.  But the cow did what it had to do right away.  Contest's over.  Everyone goes home after promoting the thing for two weeks.  Kind of wrecks it.  Oh, yeah.  Within seconds, contest was over.  And that Woody, by the way, that Woody and Wake Up Call audience, they make our listeners  look like Ford models.  You've never seen a worse-looking group of human beings.  Bingo. 
[00:39:00]  Let's see.  You have a U, an N, a T, one letter left.  Do you?  Let's go ahead.  An F, an A, two spaces, O, T.  Hey, I got an N, an I.  Hey, Mo, what is this spell?  Oh!  Yeah, someone was reminding us about letting the lobster loose.  Yeah, that was another one they do.  Where?  In Buffalo. 
[00:39:30]  Buffalo.  They promote that.  They're going to let the lobster loose.  And I guess that's the start of the weekend in Buffalo?  Yeah.  And all it is, after they promote it all week and then Friday morning, all Friday morning  long, like, coming up, we're going to let the lobster loose.  And then they play some sound clip from some movie.  From a movie with Steve Martin.  Is it a Steve Martin clip?  And that's all it is.  That's all it is.  Yeah, and then that's their big thing.  Booby Man from Brooklyn.  Wow, Opie, for being in your 20s, you sure know a lot about radio history.  Oh, wow, that's true. 
[00:40:00]  He did say late 20s, early 30s.  Yeah, I'll admit to early 30s at this point.  Shannon in Columbus, what's up?  Hey, gentlemen, what's going on?  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, the Woody and the wake-up call, their key, like, go-to bit, what they're known for,  whatever, is doing that hacky, call it, like, prank phone calls, basically.  But it's always this Woody guy who's calling in and doing these different voices and calling  people at work and making them think that, you know, their car's broken down or their... 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, the set-up prank phone call.  It's horrifying.  Where are they?  They're in Columbus.  I can't remember what station they're on.  Oh.  But they're in Columbus.  We would love to listen in.  We'll do that on XM.  We'll listen to some of these dumb morning shows in Columbus.  All right, thank you.  Thank you, Shannon.  And also, the Columbus Dispatch is an actual newspaper, too.  Oh, it is.  I figured it was.  All right.  All right, then they talk about us, how we wrecked it for everybody.  It wasn't the first time listeners perked up their ears to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  The two were fired from their radio show in 2002 after a stunt in which a couple allegedly  had sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Wow, really?  Opie and Anthony found work two years later on satellite radio and a few months ago added  an over-the-air syndicated show on CBS radio, the company that had fired them four years ago.  Uh-uh.  Locally, the Opie and Anthony show airs on The Big Wazoo from 3 to 6 p.m., hours after  the show is produced live in the morning.  So the delay makes any accidents irrelevant for our markets, said Valerie Brooks, the 
[00:41:30]  station's market manager.  We have double safeguards in place.  Double secret safeguards.  And then it just goes on and on and says the content on Oprah is something that would  get most radio stations fined, which is true, by the way.  They get away with a lot more on TV.  Uh, we went through a tough time after that Opie and Anthony incident in the church.  The fallout was incredible.  Even adult contemporary stations, which don't get into that at all, got caught up in the 
[00:42:00]  fallout.  Those stunts are typically rock radio bass, but we all got the memos.  Mm.  And then we, uh, talk about later in the article how, uh, uh, we think we took the whole stunt  thing as far as you can.  Hugh said.  I don't remember this quote from me.  Uh, Anthony said, uh, I think they were getting tacky anyway.  I think they were getting tacky anyway.  You would never say that.  I don't use the word tacky.  Not at all.  That's tacky.  Uh, so many jocks just trying, trying a shock.  It really bores people quickly. 
[00:42:30]  And then, uh, they end the article with, uh, the radio stunts that, uh, may be a thing  of the past.  Yeah.  Let's go through this really fast.  Where is this?  I don't have that.  No, this is great too.  You don't have this?  Uh, radio stunts such as these might be a thing of the past.  Breast implant giveaways.  Yep.  Those were, those were big.  You know, those are big.  And Howard used to brag about this.  Every radio station in America did it.  And Howard did not do it.  I invented it.  He did not do it first. 
[00:43:00]  Invented it, Robin.  Uh, breast implant giveaways known under various names.  The contest have served as a Christmas highlight for WBZ, uh, X screw over your X.  Another WBZX offering in which the winning listener has sex in a helicopter while flying  over the house of a former spouse.  Sounds like a great bit.  You know, you gotta be honest, right?  Sounds like a great bit, but I'm sure...  Anything that involves a helicopter.  I'm sure they did it in a hacky way.  Yeah.  What did they do?  Oh my God!  Look at that helicopter! 
[00:43:30]  And then they got one of their stupid, like, street guys in front of the house, probably  with a microphone, trying to get in touch with the, uh, X.  Uh, sex for Sam.  Uh-oh.  Which one was that?  Like, this was happening all over the place.  Yeah.  I think we were the only idiots doing this one.  Right.  You gotta give us that.  We were the only morons doing one of these.  We stood alone once again.  Yep.  We stand alone a lot.  In the, in this yearly contest named after Sam Adams beer, couples competed to have sex 
[00:44:00]  in notable public places.  Shock, shock!  Soapy and Anthony were fired for an incident in which a couple allegedly had sex in the  same patchwork.  Yeah.  Say hello to tamer gimmicks such as gasoline giveaways.  There you go.  WTVN bought $10,000 worth of gas, then announced where the gas would be given away minutes before  the pumps opened.  Wow.  These are stuff that are replacing the shocking.  Cutting edge. 
[00:44:30]  Radiothons!  The marathon fundraisers for charity have become a staple of local stations such as WSNY  and WWCD.  We've just all been castrated.  Dude, let's have a radiothon.  Not all.  Not all.  Let's have a radiothon.  I mean as an industry.  Oh yeah, the industry is, is screwed.  Let's have a radiothon, but do it for rapists.  That might be controversial.  I want to do it with...  Hey, Moe seems to be into it. 
[00:45:00]  I want to do the cow bingo thing.  You want to do cow bingo?  Yes, but I want to do it in our own style somehow.  Instead of numbers, you have our interns laying with their mouths open.  And we get a fat chick.  In a cow suit.  Hey, we could do it that way.  What?  You get a fat girl with cow ears.  You make her wear like a cow, just a cow mask.  The little horns.  Yeah.  Call her Bessie.  How about we...  When she's got to go.  How about we lay the contestants down.  We get a fat chick. 
[00:45:30]  Okay.  That may or may not make it to nine months.  Well, that could be a long contest.  But what a payoff.  Yeah.  But what a payoff.  Those episodes tend to be a bit spontaneous.  I don't think you could really plan that out.  We have a bunch of listeners with softballs.  Like a dunking booth.  You're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America, where we love to make fun of 
[00:46:00]  everything.  Hey, this is Colin Quinn.  You listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and the best is Lady Di and Marion, so you  can imagine the worst.  All right.  Why don't we get into this?  It's a slow news day, so we're kind of cleaning up some of the stuff around us today.  Karen Meyer is a...  Drunk whore?  Oh, no.  She's deaf, Anthony.  She's a deaf reporter.  I thought you were going to say something different.  She's a deaf reporter, and she works for ABC...  She can't hear it. 
[00:46:30]  She works for ABC 7 in Chicago.  Yeah.  And she only reports on disability issues.  Yeah, they do that in every big city.  It has, like, the disabled person that does the disabled stories.  Well, that's not stereotyping.  If you said we don't want a disabled person to do the disabled stories, they'd be screaming  and yelling and causing a ruckus and marching those that can.  Well, usually the Asian reporter does the Asian stories. 
[00:47:00]  They have the black reporter doing the black stories.  What are the Asian stories?  The Asian...  Whenever there's a story here in New York, in Chinatown, there's always, like, you know,  Lee Wang goes over there and does his story.  Absolutely.  Anytime there's something about genital resizing, they're right on it.  And they send the black reporter to Harlem.  Yeah.  And we've seen...  The Puerto Rican reporter does the Puerto Rican stories.  It's always very racially separatist when they do those things.  And then the handicapped reporter they had was here in New York, was a guy in a wheelchair. 
[00:47:30]  And he would do the handicapped stories.  But he would do the same dramatic...  You know when they go to the camera shot of the reporter and the reporter's maybe on  a sidewalk in a neighborhood doing the story.  And he slowly starts walking toward the camera.  They walk into the shot.  Before they go to the tape piece.  Yeah.  He would, I swear to you, be sitting there and then roll toward the camera.  Yeah.  Like, same choreography or whatever you want to call it.  Struggling.  Same thing.  And he's like, yeah, I've got to get up to speed.  Why don't you sit still, you daffy bastard? 
[00:48:00]  No, here's what they ought to do.  They ought to start the shot with a camera pointed at nothing.  And then you hear, like, the ruffle of the camera and then it aims down at him.  You see him just sitting there like a dope...  Like, hello, I'm here.  I'm down here.  I'm ready for my report.  Down here, hey, hey.  You hear him talking, you just see the top of his head.  That's how it should be.  So she's a deaf...  I see drunk people.  Thank you, Ray Moore from Pittsburgh.  Please, can we hear this deaf audio? 
[00:48:30]  I have to...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we're running out of show.  When are you drunk, Haley?  All the time.  I see drunk people.  Some of them don't even know they're alcoholics.  He was swerving out of the way because there were dead people on the road.  Right.  You can understand that, right?  All right, so Karen Meyer, deaf reporter, ABC7 Chicago, only reports on the disability  issues of Chicago.  Here we go.  It's estimated that every school in America is likely to have at least one child with  Tourette's Syndrome. 
[00:49:00]  And these children are often misunderstood.  ABC7's Karen Meyer.  And unfunny.  Let's play a little game.  Let's play a little game.  Yes, sir.  Guess when the deaf reporter speaks.  All right.  All right.  That sounds like a fun game.  All right.  Let me listen closely.  All right.  Because the first two, obviously, well, maybe one of them were deaf.  I don't know.  I couldn't tell.  Let's start again here.  It's a report on Tourette's Syndrome.  It's Karen Meyer.  She'll be in this piece eventually.  And just guess when she starts talking.  It's estimated that every school in America is likely to have at least one child with Tourette's 
[00:49:30]  Syndrome.  And these children are often misunderstood.  ABC7's Karen Meyer joins us with more about that.  Karen.  And then Sophia.  Tourette's Syndrome.  Yeah!  I don't know.  You're right back.  You've got to kill me.  What is she saying?  We beat it.  Ah!  Oh, I think I'm on a Monday.  Oh, oh, girl.  Come on.  Why is that?  Come on.  Why is that on the news? 
[00:50:00]  What?  What?  The only way I'd accept that is if she did the nightly news and did all the stories.  Stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me!  You stop laughing at me!  And that's my channel!  Stop laughing at me!  You're stupid! 
[00:50:30]  Hey, can we hear more of old Tar ears?  Hello, Grand Rapids!  hello hello this thing on hello please hear more of her please let me hear her i know we must hear

[00:54:30]  so i'm a bit lovin  tom brokaw mbc nightly news live from yellowstone  is yogi bear the picnic basket culprit we will learn tonight or is it just a plot a ploy  by ranger smith to try to make an arrest in these crimes that have been going on playing in the park for  many years could it be ricochet rabbit  i haven't seen ricochet rabbit a few times when he runs away after his bing bing bing yeah all i see is a 
[00:55:00]  cloud of smoke and a streak who knows what he's doing in the interim he could be the picnic basket  thief you know this crime has gone unsolved for many years and ranger smith very desperate to find  a perp as he likes to put it we even talked with a deputy dog deputy dog yeah he just seemed to laugh 
[00:55:30]  and not say much and act very stupid  and i spoke earlier with a huckleberry hound  who couldn't speak to me long and then hopped in a funny looking car and drove away  but tom brokaw getting to the bottom of the picnic basket  for debacle  from ill son 
[00:56:00]  the what  debacle  oh debacle okay  i don't think this crime has been handled right  right  from the start  there should have been more investigation  very important stuff  why are they pegging this on yogi  he seems like a jolly fellow  there are signs all over don't feed the bear  and why would boo boo hang out with him  well  i'll be investigating tonight  tom brokaw  mbc nightly news  well thank you tom for stopping by today 
[00:56:30]  uh all right there he goes  tom brokenjoy everyone  the opian anthony show  92.3 k-rock  92.3 k-rock  it's the opian anthony show  it's the worst opian anthony  we got passive one on the uh  here's passive one  on the line here passive one  talking about uh missiles and now we're talking about one getting cut off  passive one  thank you 
[00:57:00]  there you are  hi passive one  how are you  i'm fine thanks  how are you  very good  now um  you didn't like our little discussion we had  it was a uh a guy that was married to a woman  he was paying her alimony after a divorce  she decides to get a sex change operation to become a man  and he still has to pay alimony  even though she has changed her gender  we discussed that  we had a little fun at the expense of transsexuals  you then uh started iming me off a pal talk 
[00:57:30]  that you were very uh upset by this  and did not like our handling of it  because it uh spreads hatred and misunderstanding  of transsexuality  really  i was only i was only really mad  because you  referred transsexuality to freaks  it is a bit freakish though  it's not  it's not of the norm  which makes it freakish  it it is a bit of a freak show  to want to um  cut off a part of your body 
[00:58:00]  or have it you know  altered like that  well what about women who get breast implants  that's freakish too  now the difference  but it's a good freakish  the difference is though  you're not basically in denial of who you are  uh having a body part modified  come on you know there's a difference between that  and changing your gender  and your complete identity  the identity you had at birth  you know there's a big difference  between those two things  having breast augmentation  and changing your gender  are completely different worlds 
[00:58:30]  you can't compare  sex change operation  to breast implants  or getting a tattoo  or something like that  well not necessarily  because  you're actually altering your body  so  it doesn't matter whether  you're taking something off  or you're putting something on  your voice is half man  and half woman  Jesus  well that doesn't matter  well did  now you've been taking the hormones  for how long 
[00:59:00]  12 years  12 years you've been on the hormones  so did you grow breasts  or did you have implants put in  nope  just  just the hormones  they just grew  now how old were you  when you  well do you like this show by the way  do you like this show at all  or do you find the whole show repulsive  sorry what was that  do you like this radio show  or do you find it repulsive  I'm actually rather new to it  there's some subjects  that are actually very disturbing  but 
[00:59:30]  yeah  see that's what we do though  see we can  we can  we can like wrap this whole thing up  just by  like that's  that's our show  right  it's never going to get to the point  where we actually  are  very sympathetic  toward anything  or  you know  like if something  has a little bit of humor in it  we can joke about it  we're going to do it  it's  and it's going to upset people  and  we touch  on something  that  that  you want to have  removed  don't forget to tell her that  we go after easy targets 
[01:00:00]  yes  easy targets  are always our favorites  yeah  why do you think  they get the most laughs  why  the only problem is  you probably have millions of listeners  yes  and there's a lot of weak minded people  that don't really  understand it  right  I understand what you're going to say  you're going to say like  because of what we say  that it increases their prejudice  and  instills hatred  and instills hatred  I don't believe that  I believe people  are whatever they are  and  if they hate 
[01:00:30]  transsexuals  or homosexuals  or blacks  or Jews  they hate it  because of  upbringing  sometimes it's just  that's how they are  I don't think  an entertainment show  is really  swaying anyone's opinion  tell you the truth  by the way  Passive One  this is Jim  do you know how much money  I've dumped into your community  if you only knew  I'm the Golden Palace kid  you know how many penises  he's paid for  I wouldn't put it like that  removal maybe  removal 
[01:01:00]  remove right  I'm sorry  damn it  that almost worked  yeah  you're not afraid  of that operation  context  you're not scared  of that operation  no not at all  they do a little  snip job on you  and then drop out  the old  what is it  the old ping pong ball  you're gonna go  from male to female  let me ask you  when you  when you were a kid  or now  do you like  just look at your  genitals  and think like  yuck 
[01:01:30]  this is wrong  how does that feel  like what do you  I don't get it  well  see when I was a kid  I never really  looked at him  that much  I never really  concentrated  on my looks  why would you  not look at him  well  because I wasn't  really sexually active  until  at a later stage  in life  right  were you then  gay  or  actually back then  I was denial  I  see  I would hang out 
[01:02:00]  with my friends  but I wasn't  sexually active  because you didn't  want to have  sex with girls  I was  I would look at  I would look at  boys going after  girls and girls  going after boys  and I felt  really different  I  it's hard  but did you have  any  any  want for either  one  boys or girls  like what was  your preference  I  well back then  yeah 
[01:02:30]  yeah  nothing  and now  what about now  I wasn't  right now  I'm more  for men  of course  you're more  for men  yeah  so you become  a woman  and then  you're gonna  like get into  a relationship  with a guy  so you're gonna  turn into  an ugly broad  why would  anyone want to  turn into  an ugly broad  because it  never looks  good  ever  well  one time  I think  that bond  girl  right  the bond  girl  everyone brings  her up  Richard Keel  Tula  yeah 
[01:03:00]  Tula was a  man  and then  turned into  a bond  girl  what was  your birth  name  my birth  name was  Charlie  and what's  gonna be  your chick  name  let me guess  Charlene  well  actually  you're right  of course  you guys are  right  it's always  let me just  give my  wow  Anthony  wow  I didn't even  know that  hold on  let me talk  to closet  Trenny  Hunter  wow  because  there's always  something  it's something  ingrained in  transsexuals  minds  where  they  want 
[01:03:30]  to  keep  some  form  of  the  old  person  so  that  Charlie  will  become  Charlene  they'll  always  kind of  keep  a  similar  female  name  to their  male name  maybe  it's for  their  family's  sake  too  so  there's  some  yeah  there's  always  some  kind  of  connection  that  has  to  be  kept  even  though  they  hate  you know  what  they  are  at  that  I'm  sorry  how does  your dad  feel  like  did  you  tell  your  mother  your 
[01:04:00]  father  he's  quiet  about  it  and  my  mom  she  passed  away  this  last  year  oh  your  dad  is  quiet  about  it  do  you mean  quiet  sobs  loudly  into  pillow  yeah  that's  gotta  be  a  and  my  brother  he's  homophobic  but  I  still  respect  my  brother  and  stuff  but  but  we  don't  socialize  that  much  I  don't  think  so  let's  come up 
[01:04:30]  with  tranny  names  for us  because  someone  on  pal  talk  saying  my  tranny  name  would  be  I  mean  if  I  was  doing  the  sex  change  I  would  go  from  opie  to  Ophelia  Ophelia  Anthony  be  Anthony  hard  Antoinette  Antoinette  but I  want  a  sexy  name  I  I'd  be  Tony  Tony  with  an  I  Jimmy  Jamie  Jamie  yeah  you'd  be  Jamie  what  Ginny 
[01:05:00]  Ginny  no  Kenny  would  be  Jenny  no  Kenny  would  be  Kenya  or  some  kind  of  an  exotic  name  or  Kendra  Kendra  Kendra  Kendra  yeah  Kendra  fan  would  be  fan  I  wonder  what  Travis  was  before  it  was  Travis  alright  so  you  found  why  did  you  find  our  discussion  offensive  we  kind  of  make  fun  of  everything  you know  yeah  you  got to  kind 
[01:05:30]  of  understand  that  you know  lighten  up  it's  rough  a lot  of  times  it's  rough  some  people  call  up  and  get  upset  because  you  know  it  hits  close  to  home  but  everything  we  talk  about  is  going  to  hit  someone  close  to  home  so  you  got  to  either  kind  of  deal  with  it  or  you  know  not  listen  unfortunately  but that's  pretty much  the only two  choices  you'll keep  the thing is  yeah  the thing is  between my legs  and I want to  comment like that  it doesn't really  help society  like myself  you know  something  it might not  help it 
[01:06:00]  but it  doesn't hurt  it as much  as you guys  think  it hurts  it  it's just  humor  here  if we were  another show  like  and of course  there are going  to be people  that call  in  that really  are  seriously  intolerant  and want  to kill  transsexuals  and homosexuals  that's called  the world  that's called  the world  and just the way  things are  we are not  making it  any better  or worse  could we  make it  better  I don't  know  I don't  want to  I got my  own  friggin  problems  to deal 
[01:06:30]  with  I come  in here  on a  daily  basis  we try  to have  fun  we goof  on  everything  we goof  on  people  it's  just  the way  it is  we goof  on  everybody  else  to make  ourselves  feel  better  get a  radio show  and goof  on people  with schlongs  that want  to keep  them  that's  right  yeah  but it's  just like  the racism  back in  the 50s  you know  I guess  I like to  call it  the good  old days  that's  right  what do  you mean  we were  the school  shooters  of the  70s  but school  shooting  wasn't  popular  back then  that's  right  so we 
[01:07:00]  turned  and got  our own  radio  show  what's  wrong  with the  racism  in the  50s  what's  your  problem  there  well  it wasn't  right  well  of course  but it was  what was  happening  at that  time  that was  it  you know  that was  what  happened  people  changed it  but it  certainly  wasn't  a radio  comedy  talk show  right  we're  just  we're  a  reflection  miss  sir  miss  sir  of what's 
[01:07:30]  going on  we're an  exaggeration  people look  people back  in the 50s  made it  illegal to  have like  segregation  I call  them meddlers  those meddlers  went in and  spoiled  but in skis  but in skis  all right  listen  this has been  exciting radio  passive one  charlene  don't surf  the transsexual's  name is  charlene  sir  pilot  a pilot  all right  we got  all right  passive one  good luck

[01:15:00]  very sensitive  matter  it isn't a  removal  as much as  it is a  turning inside  out  so they're able  to create  something that  a woman has  uh by turning  inside out  something that  a man has  that's how  the operation  is done  uh so if  you don't  really have  much to  work with  they turn  it inside  out  all of a  sudden  you're you  know  take a  i think  it's a  skin graft  yeah  a skin graft  and where  are they going  to take that  from  yeah 
[01:15:30]  well i guess  from all  where  and she has  many to choose  from  as long as  it's living  tissue  as long as  it's living  tissue  yeah  have them  take it  from the  butt  so the guys  feel comfy  with you  uh a couple  observations  they did a  very good job  on the boobs  oh well  actually that's  those are your  boobs no uh  enhancement  those are just  from hormones  yep  all right  very interesting  there  what's up with  the massive scar  across your gut  what happened  there

[01:20:00]  shiklis you're  listening to the  worst of opium  anthony  let's go to  kate in jersey  kate what's up  hey  hey  i'm calling about  the porn addiction  okay  it's the real deal  man my ex was a  full-on porn addict  and what was better  he was an attorney  so he'd be watching  porn at work  and doing whatever  he was doing  and then billing  the clients for the  hours  wow  the clients would  get billed for him  doing what he's  doing  perusing pornography 
[01:20:30]  yeah why would you  say he was a  porn addict  um  does six hours a  day qualify  yep how do you  know six hours a  day you got him  on the clock  well when he came  clean to me about  that and everything  else he was doing  uh i found out  about the details  what uh what  what else was he  doing  let's just say he and  jimmy would have had a  lot to talk about  oh okay uh he liked  getting uh ladies  yes he did like getting  ladies and with my  money  and  with your money 
[01:21:00]  how do you not love  this guy no offense  and let's just say he  liked ladies that  perhaps uh would drink a  lot of water  um well no not  okay  all right okay i thought  maybe when you said him  and jimmy had something  just ladies in general  were the clients always  wondering why their uh  why their legal paperwork  was laminated  oh yeah he uh he left  that job one step ahead  of uh of an investigation  oh wow all right 
[01:21:30]  well thank you kate  oh you're so welcome  we can get a million of  those calls the weird  thing is cnn uh talked  to someone named lance  i don't think this guy has  a problem  lance i haven't heard the  audio yet but it says  lance  never gonna get through  this  uh that lance looked at  porn three to four times  a day  i think the average  adult male  looks at porn three to  four times a day  yeah definitely  easily right  if he has access to it  yeah absolutely  definitely  so that's uh barry pepper 
[01:22:00]  look like your average  american family  nice house  beautiful son  happy life  but getting to this point  was a lot harder than  you can ever imagine  i haven't looked at porn  or anything for three  years now  lance tracy is a porn addict  and it almost destroyed  his marriage  well when i was first  married you know i was  looking at porn  on a good day  or a good week  maybe once or twice a  week  bad week would be  three four times a day  for lance  the deception began 
[01:22:30]  almost  it really is nothing  that's  that's  what is that  that's like saying i'm an  alcoholic  i had a near beer on  tuesday and then a  meister brow on friday  afternoon  god almighty  what a rookie lance is  that's nothing  three to four times a day  when uh when the  when the internet  especially when the  internet first really  popped with porno  there wasn't a guy  in this country  that wouldn't have been  considered a porn addict  you spent  hours  on end 
[01:23:00]  looking at pornography  that you couldn't get  in magazines  or any of the places  you used to get it  and it was available  now at your fingertips  you were right there  you were of everyone  in the country  every man was a porn  addict  that had a computer  you couldn't even  get the magazines  i mean most guys  couldn't just go out  and get a porn magazine  because they were  married or whatever  yeah but this was  easier  it was better  it was more accessible  more material  you're saying  you know that  what you couldn't  find in magazines  i'm saying  a lot of guys  just couldn't even 
[01:23:30]  buy the magazines  themselves  but now it's  right there  on your computer  you take a quick  peek while you know  the wife is in the  kitchen you know  cooking up supper  you don't have to  change your schedule  at all to see it  right  and uh yeah  it's very addicting  but three to four  times a day  oh this guy  Lance is a creep  I'm talking about  I'm late for the  cellar sometimes  because I can't  pick myself out  of my computer chair  literally my back  hurts  I understand  what addiction  I'm like  alright well  if I keep going  I'll just take  a very fast shower  I can't stop 
[01:24:00]  I can't  I'm out of control  Lance is a little  girl  they look at him  three times a day  tee hee  oh a little  peek in the breast  oh whoopsie daisy  and they've got that  running through the meadow  acoustic music  running behind him  yeah yeah  like oh this  and then you know  when the music changes  everything goes  everything will be  uh  and he says  up to three to four  times a day  which means  unless those  unless those  sessions lasted  four hours a piece  you know who told him  he was a porn addict 
[01:24:30]  ah  that dumbbell he's married  his wife  his stupid wife  told him  that he was addicted  to porn  he got busted  he got busted  and she's like  I'm gonna leave you  he goes  but I'm an addict  I gotta  I need help  he's sitting there  going  oh jeez  I just looked  at a few nude  pictures  enough  give me a break  times a day  for Lance  the deception  began almost immediately  deception  during their entire  courtship  and for the first  two years  of their marriage  he kept his addiction  a secret  from Amy  there's a lot 
[01:25:00]  of guilt and shame  and so  you know  on my own part  because I feel  morally  it's not right  I hate Lance  see  it's this morality  that comes into it  guilt  shame  there's no shame  in it  get on there  and then like  for the first two years  while I do the courtship  he kept it a secret  well he kind of has to  what is he  what is he gonna say  sorry I was late  to pick you up  but I couldn't finish  fast enough  I couldn't get that  video downloaded  quick enough  I just had to see  what happened  when the horse  walked into the frame 
[01:25:30]  sorry sweetie  what kind of vernacular  is that courtship  like he comes in  court  exactly  come in court  I go right back  to the three to four  times a day though  that's nothing  she was gonna serenade  her outside her window  when she let her hair down  that's ridiculous  what a douche  Lance was so ashamed  that he privately  sought help  through a support group  turns out  his addiction  isn't uncommon  there are men  that I work with  who will spend  four to six hours  a day online  it's easier than ever 
[01:26:00]  to access porn  and as a result  porn addiction  is on the rise  Rob Weiss  the director  of the sexual  recovery institute  has seen it  time and time again  they'll get up  in the middle of the night  when they're sure  their wife's asleep  and they'll go on  to look at pornography  for Lance  his wife eventually  found out  and his secret addiction  became the focal point  of their marriage  I was really  really hurt  I mean  I was shocked  and hurt  and felt betrayed  and probably angry 
[01:26:30]  he immediately  got professional  counseling  but his addiction  caused a deep  rift in their  relationship  I felt like  I wasn't  attractive to him  because  these stupid women  don't get it  they don't get it  you have to be a slut  every once in a while  yeah you goody gumdrops  stop being a goody gumdrop  stop making eye contact  you have to be a slut  every once in a while  that's the secret  to James Norton  that you hit that  right on the head  she caught him  and he all of a sudden 
[01:27:00]  ended up in counseling  because she was upset  about the whole thing  he does love the old nag  he doesn't want to  end the relationship  but I hate to tell you  Cookie  in the sack  you're a dud  you know what you are  you're vanilla ice cream  you're melted vanilla ice cream  and he wanted to  bury his face  in some Twix ice cream  and maybe have a little  Twix bar on his chest  some peanut butter  it's simple  you gotta be a slut  every once in a while  it comes down to that 
[01:27:30]  comes down to that  the reality is  we all want to  F like animals  from time to time  she's a goody two shoes  I don't want to do that  it hurts  oh don't pull my hair  it'll be all messed up  I have to take the kids to work  and there's nothing wrong  with perusing pornography  pornography on the net  what the hell's wrong with it  he's probably on some  filthy sites too  I don't think so  it doesn't sound like he was  it sounds like he was  looking at some nudie pictures  sounds like he was just 
[01:28:00]  doing some basic porn  this doesn't sound like  somebody whose job  is being jeopardized  by going online  this is his wife  was hurt  like he was cheating  with the computer  or he got caught  in a dirty instant message  that she'd found  or something  and he had to tie it in  with his addiction  I don't think  that he was doing  it doesn't sound that bad  that's just it  when they had sex  and she was lying back  he would prop the laptop  up on her chest  by her face  and just type  and look up  better faces  and hotter things 
[01:28:30]  hotterfaces.com  and her chest  was all sore  because the laptop  is hot  and burning her chest  how great would that be  he's put it right  on her dumb face  don't tell your head  stupid  I'm watching something  I just want to feel loved  shut up  let's go to Bill in Jersey  Bill says it all here  Bill go ahead  hi man what's up  I just heard about that  you know that she's  complaining that  you know guys are  getting up in the middle  of the night  looking at porn  just like you guys  said if they were  getting it at home  they wouldn't have  to look it up  if you're getting it 
[01:29:00]  enough you don't  look at porn as much  if your wife is some  crazy you know  some crazy freak  and you know what  like then  they're not going  to have to go  and I'm generalizing  I'm sure there's  people out there  with legitimate problems  where they just  can't get enough  but in general  a guy will not  look at porn as much  or look at the  hot pieces of asses  walking down the  sidewalk  if they're getting  enough at home  or how about this  stupid wives  why don't you watch  it with him  or do something  for him while  he's watching it  why don't you  throw a curveball  once in a while 
[01:29:30]  instead of being  the kvetching nag  that you always are  and turn that off  that's terrible  go over there  when you catch him  go what are you  looking at  you filthy guy  what are you  looking at  oh you like  dirty stuff like  that do you  and then just like  smack him or  something  that's right  stop being a  mommy and be a  slut every once in a while  big bunt mom jeans on  when she came into  that room  and went  oh my god  wearing sensible sneakers  oh she looks up at 
[01:30:00]  the wedding picture  of both of them  with their arms  around each other  and then looks at  the screen  and there's just  disgusting donkey  and a spanish woman  dirtycowgirls.com  how could you  oh Lance  you took a vow  shut up  you know what an  awful lay she must be  an awful lay  she only wants it  one way  where she has to  put her hands  on his shoulders  and look in his eyes  and he has to  try to focus  with his eyes  wide open  pretending she's anyone  but the stupid 
[01:30:30]  mullet wife  that she is  his eyes are open  so wide  he's trying to  fantasize his  contacts fall  in her mouth  gotta throw a little  lust in the relationship  it's not all about  love ladies  pull his sweatpants  down the next time  you catch him  watching porn  stop being such  a buzz kill  spank his hiney  yeah tell him  he's bad  he's bad  you're naughty boy  for watching that  aren't you  and make him  put on a pair  of your pants  you wanna do that  you know what  don't be dirty  for real  and don't try 
[01:31:00]  that fun wife  naughtiness  that you and your  dumb girlfriends  talk about  like you know  oh maybe I'll give  him a swat  on the fanny  that's not sexy  to a porn addict  a swat on the fanny  turns no one on  swat on the fanny  you know like one of those  oh you're naughty  and then they giggle  after and spoil  the illusion  stop laughing  you whore  I've been bad  I'd love to hear  the counseling session  too  yeah I admit it  I like pictures  of girls  yeah  yeah  oh Lance  alright let's continue  here the audio  is great 
[01:31:30]  I've given to him  because he wasn't  initiating the same  way and I think  he was getting a lot  of his needs met  over the internet  yes  and so I started  wondering what's  wrong with me  well what's wrong  with you is you  didn't get the hint  the 20 million times  when he said  hello  oh look  when he said  things like  excuse me  that's not corn  on the cob  you're eating  lighten up 
[01:32:00]  they just looked  the other way  and he gave her  all the signs  right there  and it was probably  normal you know  stuff that he wanted  I'm a busy mother  do you have a picture  of her  that'd be good  fan do you have a picture  of her  well here we go  let's see what she looks like  here we go  listen to this clip  even as Lance  struggled to regain  control of his life  as with any addiction  there were times  he fell off the  wagon  while I was trying  to get better  and go into these  different little programs  and what not  I was still looking  at it off and on  that was you know 
[01:32:30]  a good sign  that I was definitely  addicted  it was a failure  to stop  even though I was  trying to stop  we have a saying  that internet pornography  is the crack cocaine  of sex addiction  and what we've been  able to tell  in the last few years  is that  on MRIs  when you see  a sex addict's brain  light up around  sexual stimulation  it looks like  a cocaine addict  that's actually the truth  but the crack addiction  is awful  because you don't  pipe people over the head  to get money  to join a website  you don't shoot cops  over porn addictions  on websites 
[01:33:00]  it's kind of a dumb thing  well good news guys  the story ends nicely here  the music  let me guess how it ends nicely  let me guess how it ends nicely  he finally begins to conquer  his porn addiction  and then she jumps for joy  and paralyzes herself  and now he watches it  with her in the bed  next to him  and there's nothing  she can do  but blow in her tube  she blows in the tube  and the NO  lights up on her screen  she was just about to jump 
[01:33:30]  and yell  whoopee  and her stupid mom foot  hit the top step  and she tumbled down  clumsily  like a sack of potatoes  now she tries to yell at him  through a straw  oh parrot lungs  what's that you're trying to say dear  as he's just got his hands full  it wasn't easy  but with determination 
[01:34:00]  spirituality  and the love of his wife  Lance is getting better  I've been sober for three years  sober  wait wait wait wait  did he say sober  could you stop using those same words  exactly  it's  say it  I've been boring for three years  yeah  I've been horny for three years  why do they use that  it really  takes away from 
[01:34:30]  alcoholism  drug addiction  when people say this  when's the last time  you use it like this  beat your wife and kids  and didn't remember it  due to a porn addiction  it's the same addiction  it really is  but I mean  don't over dramatize it  I'm almost to the date  and now  to celebrate  all that they've gone  through  Lance and Amy  have decided to renew  their vows  on their fifth wedding anniversary  fifth wedding  he's whipped already  to start over  and put the past behind us  and  behind  instead of trading in 
[01:35:00]  new partners  we just  moved away from the past  and renewed our vows  oh it's over Johnny  she's fire  we've made it through  and  you know  and we are  better for it now  yeah you really sound  convincing  very convincing  Lance  yeah  he's got to take her  to Patrice's  swinger club  yeah  take her to  La Chapeze  ew  did Patrice  go to a swingers club  oh yeah  La Chapeze  yeah  Patrice had some  stellar stories  yesterday  what did he do  with the swingers club  besides make every other 
[01:35:30]  couple uncomfortable  when he wandered  into the room  with a hot chicken  like what is he  can he just leave  we'll take her  can he stand guard  at the door  like one of those  bouncers in a strip club  when you get in a lap dance  we got everyone  that wants to pipe in  on this porn addiction thing  we got a counselor  Luanna  hey how are y'all today  alright  hi Luanna  let's go  well I just wanted to say  you realize  he's not just looking  at the porn  three and four times a day  yeah  you know that right  right  yeah he's taking care  of business  exactly 
[01:36:00]  yeah  so then he has  nothing for his wife  so that does  put a strain on the relationship  he has nothing  for his wife  because she hasn't  given him anything  Luanna she sounds  like a dud  yeah she sounds  like a dud  she sounds like  she just lays  on her back  and can't wait  for it to be over  so she can check  on the kids  and go back  to being a mom  she likes being  a mommy  the whole thing  about him being  or her being  horrified  when she saw it  oh my god  yeah like why 
[01:36:30]  didn't she jump in  and help out  and have a good time  with it  well not a lot  of women have  that freedom  to do that  it's been sexually  repressed for a long time  yeah but that's  I understand that  but there's no victims  only volunteers  you can't keep saying  things like  as a woman  I expect to be  treated equally  I expect this  I expect that  I demand this  I demand that  and you're right  to demand that stuff  but then when it comes  to the sexual views  you still play the victim  well we're taught  we're not supposed  to do that  well you're also  at one point  taught you're not  supposed to make  as much as a man  or you're not  as smart as a man  or you're not 
[01:37:00]  as dominating  in the workplace  as a man  and yet you override  those things  so what about  the sexual stuff  you're right  I don't disagree  with you  Jimmy you're 100%  correct  but it's still  it's an addiction  it's very serious  it's very scary  yeah it is  and it does ruin lives  but this guy  didn't sound addicted  this guy sounded whipped  this guy  and let me tell you  something also  if this happened  after five years  like this was  just five years  they're renewing  their vows  then it probably  started  pretty early 
[01:37:30]  in their marriage  so if they got  to do that  and then you know  she talked him  into the renewing  the vows  to make everything  all better  it's over  John  I also blame him  because he probably  wanted more from  a wife and a relationship  and just kind of  looked past all that  he probably realized  early on  that she was a dud in bed  like oh boy  this ain't gonna be good  right  he was probably  doing that long  before they got married  and a lot of times  sex addicts  will get married  thinking  well this is gonna  stop it  this is gonna help  right right  but she should  you know that  right right 
[01:38:00]  no I'm sorry  go ahead  it's gonna make them  you know  if I have a wife  I'll straighten up  I won't do it anymore  but as a guy  look I mean  I love porn  I think I'm probably  addicted to it  to the concept of it  to all of it  and I behave  like an addict  with it  so I understand that  and a lot of times  a woman will do  what you want  and you'll still  choose the porn  which is where  it becomes really  unhealthy and destructive  but just listening  to her and the way  she reacted  you know  you could just tell  that she's like  one of these hens  who is probably  just horrid  and lightly experimental  and boring in the sack 
[01:38:30]  and this guy  through addiction  wants more  you understand what I mean  it's like a woman  who comes from  a really rich family  dating a broke guy  she's gonna be miserable  and feel like it's lacking  that's the way  it is when a sex addict  marries a goody gumdrops  you're just missing  I agree  so women  get with the porn  a little bit  time to maybe  have her take a little  gander at the pillow  during some of their  sex play  you know what  maybe she needs to be taught  that blood and tears  can at times  be beneficial  and the smell 
[01:39:00]  will come out  of the sheets  all right Luanna  exactly  thank you  take care y'all  we could easily  keep going  but we have to  take a break  it's the ONA virus  spreading across America  hey this is  Geraldo Rivera  and you are listening  to the worst  of Opie and Anthony  now and have you  ever taped yourself  no  I do  I would never  tape myself  having sex  the thing is  especially when  camcorders  first became  available  to the general 
[01:39:30]  population  there's something  you can do  and it's ridiculous  when you finally  like do it  you could set up  a camera  and just have it  monitored  on a TV screen  without taping it  to see kind of  what it looks  and it just  it looks silly  and completely ridiculous  no but isn't the point  of taping yourself  to watch it afterwards  you're too busy  doing the thing  and you're going  to be self conscious  of what you look like  why would you  why would you  want to look over 
[01:40:00]  and see what's going  on on the screen  no because here's  the misconception  you would  you would tape  something thinking  alright when we're  done  we can then  watch it  and see how  hot the  smutty action was  truth of the matter  is  once  once you  pop as they say  what are you  going to do  throw it in  now you feel  ridiculous and silly  you know how  all worked up  yeah we'll tape  ourselves  this is going  to be great  we're going to  make our own 
[01:40:30]  porno  I'm going to  tape it  look at that  look I'm  taping this  right now  look how  that slide  I am just  pounding you  yeah you did  let me pull  your hair back  you bitch  and then  you get done  you want  some water  I was going to  say you want  to go out  and get a burger  or something  what do you want  watch TV  because the  last thing I  think I want  to watch  is the  videotape  I was  effing  because it's  not  a lot of  things seem 
[01:41:00]  very hot  and exciting  in the midst  of all that  passion  or beforehand  and then once  you're done  you're going to  pop it in  and go  look at my  yam bag  smacking  oh I didn't  know  oh Jesus  Christ  I didn't  know my  ass looked  like that  right  you know  look at my  face  it's like  a world  of hurt  depending on  where the hell  the camera's  positioned  and then you  got to play  director  because you know  you're monitoring  it as you're  doing it  because you've  seen the homemade  tapes  it's always  oh oh oh  and then look  and you can tell 
[01:41:30]  they're not looking  at the camera  they're looking  at the monitor  wait  lift your leg  go  no do  the  no it's  backwards  do this  and then you're  watching the tape  with a pointer  and going  hey man  you should get  that right there  checked out  that looks  that looks  malignant  sir  perhaps you  should have  that taken  care of  and no one  looks good  the porno  industry  they know  things about  shooting the  stuff  lighting  getting actors  and actresses  on there  that aren't  slobs  they're good  with angles 
[01:42:00]  yeah  and makeup  and this is  just  body doubles  and this is  the least  important part  of why you  shouldn't  videotape  yourself  fluffers  yeah you  want to see  yourself not  able to  perform on  tape  imagine your  your ex  or something  get a hold  of that  one  hey look  at limpy  over here  he couldn't  even get  it going  but again  this is just  one part  of it  that might  be bad  the worst  part of it  is now  it's documented  it's on  videotape  for what 
[01:42:30]  so in time  it can fall  into the wrong  hands  and by the wrong  hands I mean  anyone else  but yours  right  and it's on  the shelf  with the rest  of your videos  and you're  convinced like  you'll always  know where it  is  oh yeah  I'll keep  track of  that one  it's the  one  I'll just  put a  ripped piece  of masking  tape on  there  no label  but I  know  ripped  masking  tape  means  porno  and then  before you  know it  where's  where's  ripped  masking  tape  oh my  god  I lent  that to 
[01:43:00]  my  sister  you pop  in ripped  masking  tape  and it's  your prom  right  and  the one  labeled  your prom  uh oh  because you  know how many  videotapes  you've gone  through in  your life  I used to  videotape  everything  tv shows  I had a  camcorder  so any  event  band stuff  I probably  have  one percent  of all the  videos I've  shot  in any way  shape or  form  where are the  rest  you know something  I don't know  I don't know  are they destroyed 
[01:43:30]  probably not  they're probably  sitting in a  closet somewhere  in a box  over a friend's  house  perhaps they got  returned inadvertently  to blockbuster  video which is  always that good  one too  when the guy  dropped  remember the  sheriff's  uh it was a  sheriff  had sex with  his wife  videotaped it  and um  and put it in  a blockbuster  box  yeah he  accidentally put  it in the  blockbuster  box  dropped it off  in the  depository  right  and they  made copies  of it  it really  happened  because they  had copies  of this  thing  and they  circulated 
[01:44:00]  it around  the town  here's the  sheriff  and his  wife having  sex  and the  sheriff  noticed  when he  looked at  what he  thought was  his porno  movie  and it  was a  movie  that should  have been  returned  to blockbuster  so it's  always  it might  always end  up in  the wrong  hands  well chris  is gonna  videotape  his girlfriend  tonight i think  chris what's up  do it  stop you're  killing it for  me man i  just talked  her into it  and she  listens to  you guys  what what did  you talk her  into it for  why why not  i'm gonna do  that  because it's  fun  but why  yeah why do 
[01:44:30]  you want to  film yourself  having sex  i don't i  don't get that  turn on i get  a lot of turn  ons but not  that one  yeah what's  the deal  with that  because it's  something that  i've never  done i'm  it's like  captain crook  you know  we'll be  going when  no one's  gone before  it's something  i haven't  done  so when  are you  gonna watch  this tape  yeah  oh i don't  know when  i have my  buddies over  all drunk  oh that's  the worst  that is  absolutely the  worst thing  you could  possibly do  would you really  show it to  your buds  uh  well i know  she's listening  so i'm gonna  say no  oh 
[01:45:00]  rather than that  i'm ruthless  all right thanks  chris  yeah i think  you guys  i would never  be able to  show my  pals me  having sex  hey here i  am  hey guys  check me  out  dude honestly  how nice  is my seat  right  you know  what are you  gonna say  your buds  i learned  this moving  nom  check it  out  guys just  does your  left one  hang lower  like mine  does  do you  got one  that looks  like that  i hope so  if you notice  i shave  what yours  doesn't lean  way to the

[01:49:00]  time ago my  dad found a  videotape that i  made with my  ex-girlfriend and  actually brought it  to my house to  see if i actually  wanted it back  did he watch  it he told me  he did of course  he did that's  my boy yeah  there's my boy  were you good in  the tape you know  i did watch it  myself again before  i destroyed it and  uh they look too  bad well uh how  was your performance  on a scale of one  to ten a little  longer all right  thanks bro all 
[01:49:30]  right man bye  my uh my father  when i was out in  california living my  father i was about  12 another father's  story i know  they're all just  the sickest things  oh god but he  was um he was  with this uh girl  cory he was with  her and uh  apparently friends  with buzz yeah  they were all  friends all friends  together i think he  lived in a hippie  uh commune oh  actually it was very  equestrian cowboy  like yeah whatever  hopey whatever he  wants to call it  and um cory had 
[01:50:00]  uh taken uh these  black and white uh  artsy uh nudes of  herself had them  taken or something  this was before she  met my father i  guess and they were  in uh the the night  table drawer next to  their bed you know as  i was snooping around  one day looking you  know because you do  that you ever do that  you snoop around i  used to snoop all over  the place when i was a  kid always always just  snooping around and  then you find some  really like stuff that  just might disgust you  and you know what i  learned about my dad he 
[01:50:30]  never had porno  magazines around never  because when i was in  like junior high i had  a friend uh john i  don't even know what  ever happened to this  guy and like his  father had the playboys  right next to the bed  yeah and and we go  over his house seventh  grade or something he  goes let me show you  something and he would  show me where his  father's stash was  like oh it's right  here so i'm thinking  well if john's father  has a porno stash my  dad certainly has to  have one too  the search is underway  and i searched up and 
[01:51:00]  down never found  anything  ripping down walls  without it i i searched  everywhere ransack  because i'm thinking  you know  maybe i don't have to  go to john's house to  see the porno my dad's  got to have a stash  never found it  found his condoms  though  oh that is so wrong  when you're snooping  as a kid  ah  that was the worst  thing i ever found  though  yeah i i imagine  other people found  worse  good  i used to snoop  everywhere though like  friends houses and  you'd snoop it in their

[02:04:30]  bandana on  what a buzz kill  you're trying to scratch his little  chin  oh  coughing  all right sorry getting back to  where are we in this uh we were  talking about fatty pig fatty and  there's a blog that this a fat girl  has um  and she doesn't like the contest very  much  okay uh velvet who is this um  plus size model posted on this and  she called it a despicable in every  sense of the word the contest i agree  says um do we have a name for her 
[02:05:00]  yet  i don't think so  yeah  why not  sue ann  okay so sue ann she says i agree  but what i find even more despicable  something more than that it and she  says imagine that being said by  sylvester the cat  does anybody remember laughter  wait i'm trying to think what else  sylvester could say but fat c he can  say without  without slashing  no  uh what she finds even more despicable 
[02:05:30]  is that women are actually showing up for  this contest  that's right because they have a sense  of humor  uh they need the money  oh yeah  there are two hard truths at work here  there will always be morons like opi and  anthony can't be helped  the stupid and ignorant will always be  with us  and there will always be people who  will do anything for money case in  point fear factor 
[02:06:00]  you should say there's three points  uh there's always going to be morons  people will do anything for money  and i'm a fat pig with no power  point three  people and i use that term loosely like  opi and anthony  and unlike her own pants which have not  been loose since she was in fourth grade  right uh your arm fat and i use the term  loosely  you pig people at least we're shaped like  humans  you fat go to jupiter where you fit in  you slob you're a slovenly slob woman 
[02:06:30]  people and i use the term loosely like opi  and anthony  we are people we're people who actually  have the nerve and the uh the the guts  to speak honestly about monsters like  yourself you're a freak of nature a  monster you want this earth being  looked at like a monster the freak that  you are you fat slob  oh that's human she uses the term loosely 
[02:07:00]  we have a forum opi yeah and jimmy of  course because people give them one  if people boycotted their show and  didn't encourage their immature and  hurtful antics maybe it would stop  how about you boycott food you freak  how about doing that instead of  dedicating all this energy to boycotting  us how about you eliminate uh fat people 
[02:07:30]  and that way we couldn't have a contest  like this  eliminate carbs  you shut your mouth for a second and  stop shoving food in there and then  perhaps we couldn't do this contest and  we'd have to concentrate on the  anorexics  like we want to on our next contest  wait i forget oh i forget what i had a  name for it too oh no  so sue ann's go away and heathers  come on board for our uh bulimic and  anorexia contest  the puke you silly goose contest 
[02:08:00]  we are thinking of doing it  all right where are we  bitch okay uh but instead their moronic  behavior is revered and celebrated it's a  simple fact ignore the class bully and  he will stop fear or applaud him and he  will continue  she raises a good point she raises her  weight that's all she raises slob it's  also known fact that a very large woman  are often at the at near the bottom of  the economic chain 
[02:08:30]  well it's a weight issue yeah they were  on top the economic chain to be crushed  here's yeah here's um here's why  fatty because people don't want to hire  for the most part fat women fat women's  job options are less than thin women  because bosses don't like having fat  women around the places they work they  want hot pieces of ass right because  they think they might bang them  eventually they want cuter women because 
[02:09:00]  either they bring in more business yeah  or like opie said maybe there's an  opportunity to bang them and then  added to fatties uh they know that  maybe their lunch breaks aren't going  to last two hours there's plenty of  reasons to hire a skinny girl they're  looking for eye candy yeah you want to  pinch someone's ass they walk by that's  what a secretary is when she walks by  you take your your pointer finger and  your thumb and you go pinch you pinch  and maybe go while you're doing it  pinch and then she turns around looks  you wink that's right and then she  goes and gets you that cup of coffee 
[02:09:30]  light and sweet honey and that's how i  take it on when you pinch her fanny her  arm should be splayed out and her leg  should kick up behind her in the tea he  move what is known as the tea he move  uh yeah you're at the bottom of the  economic chain because uh it's harder to  get uh high-paying jobs if you're fat if  you lose weight you'd get some and 50% of  your income perhaps more goes to food  and you're always late because you get  this bad gas mileage right in your car  they're getting the gas mileage of a 
[02:10:00]  tank and bad gas too this easy money  would be tempting for anyone i admit the  first thing i did was calculate how much  money i would win and that's none of  your beeswax that's what she says i  think she has to go somewhere where  there's honey nearby see right say even  she was tempted by this contest yeah even  she did the math and her big fat head  and who hasn't done the math as you  walk around town but for every  supersized woman who showed up for this  despicable contest there are thousands 
[02:10:30]  who didn't but supersized and here that  she was very large yeah how about just  an honest language fat you're fat it's  it's not even i'm not even saying that  now and to be angry or hurtful you are  fat so don't try to soften what you're  saying supersized women what does that  mean what does it even mean it means  fat thousands of plus size women plus  size women just trying to make their 
[02:11:00]  lives work in this crazy world just like  everyone else no not just like everyone  else like like a monster you're a monster  go out tonight on halloween don't wear  anything but what you wear every day  there you're in costume as a beast  machine it's a blue whale she doesn't  have a costume on and women like velvet  strutting their stuff with glamour and 
[02:11:30]  pride no people look at fat women that  come out on the runway with glamour and  pride as freaks you look and go where  are the skinny models you look at them  it's like a freak show it's a gag it's a  goof your first thought is man if she  lost 50 pounds yes really might look good  that's your first thought always like  the girl in our uh tv commercial right  she's beautiful pretty but the first  thing i thought was man if she lost 50  pounds man and let me tell you this girl  would be a knockout that girl's  overweight but she's well kept she's a 
[02:12:00]  pretty she takes care of herself 99% of  these fatties can't even do that they  stink because they can't wash their fat  they don't take care of themselves  because they've given up that's what  we're talking about monster and women  like velvet strutting their stuff with  glamour and pride these are the women i  applaud can you applaud can you touch 
[02:12:30]  your hands in front of your body she  has to slap each hand on her leg yeah on  that thigh my advice to all women tempted  to enter the opium anthony contest just  say no just say no my advice to all who  want to follow the contest and or this  despicable show just say no trust me the  world would be a better place no you  know the world would be a better place  without the likes of you she just says  no a lot except when it counts yeah for 
[02:13:00]  her own cholesterol when it comes to  dessert menu how about just say no that's  right hey you want that big frappuccino  how about you just say no to that what's  her name  suann suann suann a fat girl name a big  fat girl name we got kelly from syracuse  on the line kelly  hey i really think that this whole  contest is horrible and if you guys have  any heart at all any soul that you guys  would feel for these fat chicks a little  bit 
[02:13:30]  why feel for a monster that is bashing our  contest and our show you mean the ones  that come in it might not it might not be  their fault there could be a thyroid  oh crap i've heard that what one person  i'll give one percent the benefit of the  doubt one percent of those fatties the  benefit of the doubt of for some kind of  medical reason the rest of them are big  pig face stuffing monsters with no self  control that want us to cater to them  miss i'm not going to be an enabler for a 
[02:14:00]  pig we all know fat people in our own  lives and if you just take uh just a  moment to look at what they're eating  you're like oh come on i mean you can  help yourself a bit you can help  yourself a bit here how many faulty  thyroids are out there  kelly how fat are you big girl  ramon give me a twinkie  the opi and anthony show  92.3 k rock </pre>
