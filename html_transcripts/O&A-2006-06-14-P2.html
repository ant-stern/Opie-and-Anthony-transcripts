<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Homeless Radio" segment featuring two homeless guests, "Blue" and "Tippy Tom."  The conversation was highly erratic and jumped between a wide range of topics. Tom frequently mentioned his mother, describing their relationship as "powerful" and hinting at possible mob connections. The Iraq War was discussed, touching on bombing campaigns and the morality of nuclear weapons.  The impending hurricane season, its potential impact on New York City, and the broader issue of global warming were also brought up.  The segment further delved into the problems of homelessness, offering various (unspecified) proposed solutions.  The Iranian leader's possible World Cup attendance and his controversial Holocaust denial were mentioned. The discussion included tangents on gay marriage, the Blu-ray vs. HD DVD debate, the immigration debate and border wall, a lawsuit against Kentucky Fried Chicken for its high fat content, and the death of Al-Zarqawi.

Notable moments included a caller playfully calling Tom "Golden Buns," Blue identifying as both heterosexual and bisexual, and Tom's vehement opposition to "cat chicken" (a misunderstanding of "fat chicken").  The hosts frequently interrupted the guests' often rambling and nonsensical contributions.  The segment concluded with emotional, albeit rambling, goodbyes from Blue and Tippy Tom.

[00:03:30]  I have a beer here.  That was funny.  Tom, do you think we should drop bombs or shouldn't?  I know.  No.  No bombs at all.  Unless they know us first.  If they bomb us first, but the thing is, the United States is the most powerful country in the world. 
[00:04:00]  You got that?  Think about it.  All right.  It's bigger than the Roman Empire.  If you go back to history, it's bigger than that.  Rome took over a lot of territory.  But America is the biggest, the baddest, biggest, and freedom. 
[00:04:30]  And you got everything to go with it.  All right, Tom.  That's a good point.  Let's go to the phones.  Peter from Massachusetts.  You got a question for Blue and Tom on Homeless Radio.  Hey, guys.  I have a question.  It's actually two parts.  Number one, do you think we're going to have a bad hurricane season?  And do you think a hurricane will hit New York City?  Are you talking about a hurricane or tippy? 
[00:05:00]  Tom, go first on this one.  What do you think about it?  Well, a hurricane?  Yeah, right over here.  Well, I really feel sorry about that.  I have no control over the weather.  And the thing is, if you had a hurricane, that's nature.  And so you pray to God to please pray to God.  All right?  Believe in God.  That's what I do.  The thing is, if a hurricane come over and blew your house over, I have no control over that. 
[00:05:30]  I'm not all that powerful.  I wish I could.  I would stop it.  But a hurricane is a hurricane.  And you got to deal with it.  But my friend, where you live at?  This Big Blue talking.  I'm Big Blue.  I'm from Jersey.  He's from Massachusetts, Blue.  What do you think about the hurricane season coming up? 
[00:06:00]  Massachusetts, I've been there.  I've passed through.  I think it'll pass through.  But just like what Tippy Tom was saying,  just got to look up in the sky and pray to God.  Of course I do.  All right.  Does that answer your question, Peter?  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Uh, yes.  Tippy Tom, Believe in God.  All right.  Uh, Dan from Rhode Island, you got a question for Tippy Tom and Blue.  Yeah, I got a question for old Golden Buns. 
[00:06:30]  Um, hey, Tom, what do you think about global warming?  Golden Buns.  Ha, ha, ha.  What do you think about the global warming issue and how should we solve it?  Well, I, I believe in heat.  I like warm.  So global warming is good.  Yeah, if you sleep outside.  Blue, your thoughts, global warming?  I'm going to warm it.  Yeah.  I want more heat. 
[00:07:00]  I, I get cold.  Fucking bums.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thanks.  Who called me a bum?  Uh, Jeff.  Call me a bum?  Jeff from New York.  Go ahead and ask a question.  Jeff, you call me a bum?  Will you tell that son of a bitch?  Go ahead, Jeff.  Try again, Jeff.  Try to get in there.  I'll tell his grandmother that he called me a bum. 
[00:07:30]  I know his connections.  I swear to God, I'll have him in trouble.  That's right.  All right.  Hold on, Tom.  I'm just going to go to lunch with me.  All right.  Tom.  Go ahead, buddy.  How would you solve the homeless problem if you were president of the United States?  That's a good question.  You talking to Timmy Tom or Blue?  Uh, Tom.  Timmy Tom.  No, the homeless problem, what I would do is take all that taxpayers' money and I'd build 
[00:08:00]  more fucking housing so these people will have to live outside.  Okay?  In a ring.  I'm a homeless man, and it's not that expensive.  They spend billions of dollars on military weapons.  Why can't they spend a billion dollars?  For the homeless.  Yes.  Thank you.  Get rid of the military. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  We need a strong military.  I'm all for that.  But the thing is this, is that we got people that need a place to live, and it's not that  much.  And all they want is a place to sleep and a comfortable, safe place.  And we want no people to, um, like purple.  It's not that much.  We got abandoned, excuse me, we got abandoned buildings in New York that, you know, so people 
[00:09:00]  don't have to be like that.  So they have a home.  So build more homes.  Uh, in New York we got plenty of space.  The thing is this, yeah, of course, I'm a homeless man.  But myself, I know homeless people all over New York, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and all over 
[00:09:30]  Queens.  You got the shirt on, Brooklyn.  I'm from Brooklyn.  I'm tippy-ton.  This big blue.  Well, I go to Brooklyn.  The thing is that I think we need to, um, um, you know, it's not much money to help people.  All right, uh, let's move on to another subject.  Don't you want to be comfortable?  Yes.  Don't you want to feel comfortable? 
[00:10:00]  All right, Tom.  And have a place to live and...  Point taken.  Point taken.  All right, let's get to another caller.  Allison from Pennsylvania.  Go ahead.  You got a question for Tippy Tom and Blue on Homeless Radio.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I wanted to find out what their opinion was on the Iranian leader possibly going to the  World Cup.  Well, go ahead.  What, what, what, what, what?  You might have answered.  Well, if you need...  I didn't get that right.  If you need any help...  Speak slower. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, God.  Stop trickling down his beard.  Um, the, uh, I think the question is because, uh, the Iranian president has made some comments  that the Holocaust never existed.  Should he be able to go to Germany and see the World Cup where it's actually illegal to  make such comments?  Okay, burp.  Nothing.  Uh...  Are you out of your mind?  Hold on.  Thanks, Allison.  How am I going to answer that question?  You got to explain it differently. 
[00:11:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm a little slow.  It's no problem.  What about, uh, the World Cup in general?  You like soccer?  Excited?  Oh!  My cousin is a good soccer player.  Yeah.  Of course.  I don't know who's up.  I ain't kept up with it.  But if you were to have a favorite team, who do you, who do you think it would be?  The soccer teams?  Who's your favorite World Cup team?  Well, many of them, um, uh, got me to say, I'm not a real soccer player. 
[00:11:30]  I'm more baseball.  Okay.  What about the U.S. team?  You like them?  Yankees, man.  Yankees?  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, let's hit another controversy.  Yankees ain't baseball.  You're totally right.  Uh, let's hit another topic here.  Jim from Arizona.  Come on.  Give me something.  Give Tom and Blue something to talk about. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Go ahead, Jim.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, Tiffy Tom.  I'll keep it easy on you.  What do you feel about gay marriage and the president on that?  The president of who?  What do you think about gay marriage, Tom?  Should be allowed?  Who?  Do you think, uh, men should be able to marry other men legally?  Yes.  I'm off for it.  I, if you want to fall in love with somebody, that's fair with me. 
[00:12:30]  I don't care.  It's your business.  If you fall in love with a man, go right ahead.  If you fall in love with a woman, two women, it's okay with two women?  All right.  Well, two men, if you fall in love with somebody, why not?  All right.  Blue, you kind of laughed there.  What do you think about men marrying other men? 
[00:13:00]  Well, I'm going to tell you like this.  This is big blue.  I'm a heterosexual and bisexual.  All right?  Just like what Tiffy Tom said, if you have a lover, if you fall in love with him, go with it.  Doesn't matter what gender.  Gender.  All right.  That's beautiful.  That's my buddy, Blue.  You guys are friends.  Let's go.  Well, Tiffy Tom ain't my lover, okay? 
[00:13:30]  That's fine.  I wasn't insinuating that.  Got a technology question from Jasper in Massachusetts.  Go ahead with your question, buddy.  Jasper, go ahead.  Hey, man.  Hey, great show.  Hey, listen.  I'm upgrading my home stereo, I mean my home theater, and I don't know if I should go  Blu-ray or HD DVD.  All right.  I'll try to pass that on to him.  You guys have any thoughts on the new DVD formats coming out? 
[00:14:00]  What DVDs?  What the fuck are they?  They play movies on them.  Can I jerk off?  I mean, if I can't jerk ass and jerk off, what the fuck I want that goddamn thing for?  I don't have to beat my meat when I'm fucking drunk.  I do the right thing.  Yeah, you can say whatever you want.  Satellite Radio. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  You're a radio show?  All right.  Don't tell them who I am.  Okay.  My name is Blu.  I'm going to fuck you up.  All right.  Now, wait a second now.  What the fuck?  What the question was about?  I don't remember.  We're going to move on to Brian from Dallas.  Dallas.  Tick.  Brian, you got a question for Tippi Tom and Blu? 
[00:15:00]  Go ahead.  From Dallas?  Guys, I wanted to ask you what you think about this section of the immigration bill that says we have to ask Mexico if we can build a wall along the border.  We've got to get their permission.  I think that's wrong.  I personally, no wall.  I'm tired of the wall.  We pulled out a wall in Germany and break up Germany.  And, no, we don't need no more walls. 
[00:15:30]  That's all I have to say.  Let it go.  All right.  Blu, your thoughts?  How do we solve the immigration problem?  I don't know.  I'm not in Dallas.  I'm not all right there.  I'm in New York.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I be trying to take care of New York.  All right.  You're a very immediate person.  All right.  Well, some other stuff we've got going on in the news.  The Kentucky Fried Chicken is getting sued for being too fat. 
[00:16:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, why, why?  KFC came sued for what?  People are saying there's too much trans fat in their foods, and that kills too many people with the fat in the foods.  Well, we got to put some less than a shortening in it and all in it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He said put too much cat in the chicken? 
[00:16:30]  Too much fat, Tom.  Too much cat?  That's a bring me up then.  I'm getting sick of this.  I mean cat?  No.  Well, I mean chicken?  No, but please.  You my brother?  Who do you think is responsible, though, the consumer or the company for selling, you know, the dangerous product?  The consumer. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Tom, do you think the company should stop selling fat chicken or people should stop buying fat chicken?  What do you think?  The company should stop fucking selling cat chicken, and I'm sick of it.  All right.  Tom, no one ever said you didn't commit to a bit.  I've eaten it.  No more cat chicken.  I am sick of it.  I want some something different.  Put some turkey in that chicken. 
[00:17:30]  No more cat in the chicken.  All right.  And your people are telling us we've got to wrap this up.  So we've got one more topic.  The recent death of Al-Zarqawi.  Did you hear about that?  No.  The head, one of the head terrorists in Iraq got killed.  The U.S. bombed him and killed him. 
[00:18:00]  What do you think about that?  What did he do wrong, number one?  He beheaded some people.  He killed people.  Yeah.  Cut off their heads and also...  What's the U.S. doing over there?  Um, bombing him.  Why?  We're going to go around in circles, aren't we?  Why?  Because he was a bad person that was blowing up Americans and other people.  He was doing that?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know this. 
[00:18:30]  If he was doing that, he got to get his ass beat.  The thing is this.  I don't know.  That's true to be told.  Okay.  No.  Now, are you sure about this?  It's pretty well documented.  So this guy was bombing who?  Us.  Civilians, Americans.  I had all bombings here in America?  No.  They were in Iraq because we have got troops over there.  He would attack them.  Oh, I see what you're saying. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  All right.  So in other words, there were bombing people, American troops.  What are Americans doing in Iraq in the first place?  To get the fuck out of there and come home.  All right.  Blue?  All right.  Yes.  Your thoughts?  My thoughts?  I mean, on the terrorism, all that bombing, all that, on my mama grave.  God bless you, ma.  Let's kill it, man.  Let's kill it there. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  And for your final thoughts, we're going to wrap up the show.  Tom, what do you need to say before we sign off?  Well, I just want to say I love you.  And be well.  Look at all of y'all guys.  What was that, Tom?  Sorry, Blue was talking.  I just say I love you and be well.  Be well.  And I'll hold you if you need me.  And just...  I got to go now.  Just...  Wait, wait.  Not yet, Blue.  Just...  Just be you. 
[00:20:00]  And be the best you you can be.  And be strong.  And don't take no shit from nobody.  And blah.  That's what I say.  All right.  Not blah, but I love you.  Okay?  How's that?  That's awesome.  Blue.  Yes.  Final thoughts.  Final thoughts.  About what?  We're wrapping up the show.  What do you want to say to America before we finish?  America, this is Big Blue, as my name is Odell. 
[00:20:30]  America, just be safe.  Travel safe.  Be safe.  Holla back.  That's it.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  That was Homeless Radio.  That'll work.  That'll work. </pre>
