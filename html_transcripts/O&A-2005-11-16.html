<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with raucous banter and insults directed at crew member Steve, swiftly transitioning to a discussion about the upcoming appearance of Miss FHM 2005, Lauren Harris.  The hosts recount a chaotic photo shoot for FHM, detailing Anthony's refusal to wear the provided clothing and his subsequent plans to return unwanted items.  A significant portion of the early show is dedicated to a furious rant about a limousine driver's incessant demands for a credit card imprint despite pre-arranged payment, culminating in Anthony's infamous, "Shut the fuck up and close the partition. I don't want to see your fucking face."  The hosts also discuss Bill Burr's HBO special, the Container Store, and their general disdain for limousine services. Bill Burr joins them in studio.

Lauren Harris then arrives, and the conversation shifts to her Miss FHM win, the photo shoot, and future appearances.  The hosts pepper their interactions with her with sexual innuendo and crude jokes. The limo incident is revisited, along with listener feedback criticizing the show's content.  The hosts promote their recurring segments, "Whip Them Out Wednesday" and "Hummer Tuesday."

The show continues with a discussion on the perceived compromise of their show's integrity in exchange for publicity from the photo shoot, labeling it a "trade-off" for listener engagement. This segues into a mocking critique of a proposed "Celebrity Navigation System Audio," deemed unrealistic and poorly conceived.  They then speculate (correctly) about Lauren's emotional and increasingly absurd interview on Fox and Friends, even predicting her escalation to claims of Al-Qaeda involvement and knowledge of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts.  This leads to a discussion of Bruce Willis's reward offer for bin Laden.

The conversation then jumps to Paris Hilton's exotic pets, her perceived lack of talent, and her public image as a "slutty heiress," criticizing the continued success of *The Simple Life* despite the known animosity between Hilton and Nicole Richie. The hosts share vulgar and graphic anecdotes about their past blue-collar jobs, including tales of heavy drinking, drug use, workplace injuries, and fights.  Opie contrasts his experiences with those of his co-hosts, highlighting the more physically demanding nature of their past employment.  The celebrity GPS idea resurfaces, transitioning to a discussion on the practice of buying named stars. Callers share their experiences, with an astronomer confirming the practice's meaninglessness.

The next segment focuses on the dubious practices of selling named stars and lunar land.  A recurring joke about Howard Stern's purported invention of various concepts, including MTV Unplugged and reality television, is heavily featured, with callers contributing invented examples and the hosts offering counterarguments and evidence.  Several callers contribute to this, alongside discussions about celebrity-voiced GPS navigation systems (Mr. T, Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds), their use in NYC taxis, and the new capabilities of DirecTV and its DVR function. Numerous callers participate, including Cody (Minnesota), Kirby (Oklahoma), Jason (Virginia), Corey (Georgia), Josh (D.C.), Fred (New Jersey), Rich (Georgia), Chris (PA), Plastic Man (Columbus, Ohio), Josh (D.C.), Brad (Michigan), Black Earl (former WNEW colleague), Scott Ferrall (sports commentator), and Linda (listener with an anecdote about "The International Silver String Submarine Band"). The segment is awkwardly interrupted by an unsolicited music submission, "Chemistry."

The show shifts gears again, discussing a dog seen on television, then a 19-year-old college student's 30,000-calorie sandwich, comparing it to a similar segment on Good Morning America.  They play a bizarre Norton Furniture commercial and discuss a New Jersey bear hunt. A large portion focuses on comparing Vanessa Minnillo and Tyra Banks's nearly identical segments on Entertainment Tonight featuring fat suits, mocking their emotional reactions and perceived hypocrisy.  The show concludes with the regular "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment. Bill Burr recounts a drunk driving arrest and its consequences.

The final segment focuses on drunk driving, sparked by a listener's suggestion of a "drunk driver's license." Callers share humorous anecdotes about their own experiences with drunk driving.  Bill Burr, still in studio, contributes his own stories.  The hosts wrap up the show, promoting Burr's upcoming gig.

[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you're stinky.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The show.  If you have any poo, let's get the show on the road.  Oh, I see the awful, I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[00:04:30]  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Please, please stop pulling me.  Please stop pulling me.  Please stop pulling me.  Please stop pulling me.  Please stop pulling me.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You keep your hands off of my mule. 
[00:05:00]  You're just a tool.  Does that bring back memories, Bill Burr?  The funniest fucking guy ever.  Oh, that guy was the best. 
[00:05:30]  What up, Rick?  That's going to be really obnoxious this early in the morning.  Who's the young go-getter outside the studio?  Yeah, who is that?  That Alex P. Keaton-like gentleman walking around.  Oh, it's the FHM publicist.  Oh, it is.  Oh, hey.  Very nice.  Shoot.  We got a photographer outside the studio, the FHM publicist.  Boo-whet!  They're announcing Miss FHM today. 
[00:06:00]  Ooh.  Good old Lauren Harris will be in studio today.  Nice.  As they announce her as the FHM, um, cooler.  No, don't say that.  We have a great relationship with FHM.  Oh.  She's Miss FHM.  Wow-wee.  Are you kidding me?  They made a fine, fine choice.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  What does the pouring the champagne on the girl's chest symbolize? 
[00:06:30]  What is that?  Um, that's...  What does that symbolize when champagne, like, the cork pops and bubbly, creamy foam just  goes all over the face and chest?  I don't know what that symbolizes.  I like that.  I don't know what that symbolizes, but the, uh, the tongue piercing, I know what that symbolizes.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  She likes a certain activity.  Jesus.  What, does it say that in her likes and dislikes?  You know, we gotta calm down, man.  I gotta tell you right now.  We gotta calm the fuck down.  You don't really need to say anything after you make a move like that. 
[00:07:00]  No.  We really got to calm down, though, because we're starting to get a nice relationship with FHM.  Don't screw it up.  Opie and Anthony, we might be doing some things with FHM, so why don't we calm the fuck down?  Things.  She's just a nice young lady.  Can I see that?  Like they did in the old days.  She's a piece of ass, though, I'll tell you that much.  And we got a young, young go-getter outside the studio to make sure everything goes well.  I want to welcome Mark Richards to the program today. 
[00:07:30]  Mark Richards?  Mark Richards from Fort Worth, Texas.  Let me read his instant feedback.  All right.  Haven't heard you guys since you went off the air.  I guess he's talking about three years ago.  But now I hear you on my DirecTV satellite today here in Dallas.  Good to hear you again.  It's been a long time.  I just wish I could figure out what time you guys are on.  Hmm.  Well, we're live on the East Coast from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.  Yes.  And then repeat throughout the day here and there.  Yep.  All right.  And as far as the DirecTV goes, I guess we're at the top of the dial, basically. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  We're as far as you can go.  And then you turn into Channel 2.  Channel 2.  So all you have to do is go to Channel 2 and just tune down on one or two.  I love the fact that somebody could be on Channel 2 and then go to hit the remote, hit the  wrong direction, and land on us in the middle of some kind of conversation.  Some kind of rant where there's a lot of cursing going on.  Perhaps they're watching their morning news programs.  Uh-huh.  And they're watching Katie Couric. 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  And they think they're going up Channel 3, 4, 5.  And boom, they hit the wrong direction.  And hear like us talking.  Just chatting about something.  Just chatting.  Yeah.  This DirecTV deal is just huge for our show.  And we can be happier.  It certainly is.  All right.  We've got to get into some things today.  Things.  We've got to talk about the steroid thing.  We've got to talk about the bear hunting thing.  Yes.  We've got to talk about stupid Paris Hilton and her thing. 
[00:09:00]  More publicity for her.  Things.  But we do have to start with our fine photo shoot that went on yesterday.  We had a photo shoot yesterday.  In a fancy, fancy place.  It was very fancy.  Very professional.  Down in the meatpacking district.  Wow.  See Paris staggering out from behind a dumpster.  Spitting out a load.  Nice to meet you.  I did see the container store. 
[00:09:30]  I was stunned that there is actually a container.  Can we ask you one question?  What's that?  Container store.  Is it on 19th Street?  Yeah.  And it was right near Bed Bath & Beyond.  Yeah, down there on 6th Avenue.  If you saw Bill Burr on his HBO comedy special.  Which is hysterical.  It aired last night, by the way.  Did it?  Again?  Yes, it did.  That is very cool.  You didn't feel the ripple in the entertainment world?  Well, everyone's called to congratulate you on the repeat. 
[00:10:00]  But more importantly, it's on demand.  So the fine folks out there can watch it when they want.  That's what I do.  I have a comic-like festival.  I'll just put them all on demand.  Watch them one after another.  That guy sucks.  Funny sucks.  Sucks funny sucks.  I've got to see Jim's.  Jim's was very good.  Tremendous.  Excellent.  But we're driving to the photo shoot yesterday, and we passed the container store, and we  all start just laughing openly.  It's the container store.  We all kind of thought...  You want to go to the container store? 
[00:10:30]  Get some containers for your patients.  One whole wall of the place, like, you know, the windows, we're passing by, and one whole  side of the building was nothing but hangers.  Plastic hangers.  A block long.  Just red and blue and white and different goals, just filling the window.  So you just organize everything in your apartment to the point it makes you want to kill yourself.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to put the pants on the red hangers. 
[00:11:00]  The blue hangers are your hangers, and the big ones are my hangers.  Why don't you hang a flannel shirt on a blue hangers?  Just fucking sitting there, kill me.  Can you take that hanger and fucking dig one of my eyes out with it, please?  I don't know whose idea it was to make the container store, but I guess they do a business over  there.  You nailed that one, though, Bill, because if you're in a relationship, you end up doing  things maybe you don't want to do.  It's just that give and take that happens if you want to be in a real relationship. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  But you took it to a whole new level with that bit with the container store.  We didn't even think a container store existed.  I never know.  We thought you were just kind of exaggerating the whole give and take thing in a relationship.  But then when we passed the container store yesterday, forget it, man.  We lost it.  Any normal guy uses, I guess, what would be Bed Bath & Beyond.  You use that as the kind of thing where you don't want to go.  That's the hacky one.  Right.  That's the hacky one.  Right.  That's the exact same joke, but you just switch it up. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  The hacky one.  I say McDonald's, you go Jack in the Box.  I'm an artist.  Because you could have done it with Bed Bath & Beyond, but container store is so much funnier.  Container store.  I don't go with the obvious.  Right.  The obvious food chain or whatever.  I take it down another level.  It was great.  It was absolutely great.  I don't say Macy's.  I say J.C. Penney.  Right.  There you go.  Well, we had our photo shoot yesterday.  Yes, we did. 
[00:12:30]  For what?  Do we even know what it was for?  Oh, the stand-ups that are going to be in all the Best Buys, I guess?  Oh, is that it?  Our life-size stand-ups?  All the markets that we're really hot in on commercial radio, we're going to have stand-ups  and Best Buys.  Is it going to at least be in color?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Black and white.  Color, life-size stand-ups.  Yes, and then they're going to use them for any other occasion where they might need  pictures of us, they said.  Right.  Yeah.  Good pictures.  When we do something stupid and the press is looking for a photo. 
[00:13:00]  They won't use those.  No.  So you wore your slacks, Anthony?  I wore slacks.  And yes, dress shirt.  Button down.  By the way.  I wore the fine clothes we bought on our shopping spree.  Out of all the clothes that they bought for us on Monday?  Yeah.  I only wore the shirt.  Yeah, you didn't wear the pants or the shoes that you had bought.  No.  Thousands of dollars in merchandise wasted.  Because I already knew what I was going to wear.  Yeah.  But I'm not stupid.  If they want me to shop on their dime, I'm shopping on their dime. 
[00:13:30]  So he comes in and he's wearing the pants that are ripped up.  He's got rips in his pants.  And he's like, I think these look good.  Doesn't even change into the new clothes.  And, of course, they agreed with me.  And I knew the whole time I had the right pants for the right look.  Yeah.  For the look they were going for.  Yeah, the late 80s rock star.  Right.  Like that least thing.  Shredded with razor blades the whole way down.  Yeah, the guy from Def Leppard wore those things.  Acid wash.  Right.  Acid wash.  It's all coming back, Bill.  It's all coming back.  Yeah.  Front row. 
[00:14:00]  Hmm.  And, yeah.  So I didn't need their dumb clothes.  Yeah.  They were getting, you know, my pants tailored and everything.  Yeah, they had those pants tailored.  I didn't use any of them.  No, I didn't need to use any of that stuff.  I wasn't going to use the cufflinks.  You didn't use the cufflinks?  Fuck no.  I'm returning the damn cufflinks.  Are you going to get the money?  Of course I am.  No, I'm not going to get the money.  I'll pick out something I want.  Oh, I want.  Kind of exchange it.  Something that they weren't going to buy at the time. 
[00:14:30]  How much were the cufflinks?  Like 50 bucks.  50 bucks for the cufflinks.  They're going back.  And the really faggy, French-caught black shirt.  You don't like that one?  Absolutely not.  What was that, 80 bucks?  110.  110?  So I got at least $160 coming my way.  So I'm going to go there and get something that I want.  Get something nice.  Yeah.  Well, our shopping or our photo shoot didn't start out very well.  No.  I got to acknowledge that Anthony is just absolutely awesome. 
[00:15:00]  Thank you, O.  Because everyone expects it from me.  You know, we talk about this from time to time.  But Anthony lost his shit yesterday.  I lost my mind.  And I was the calm one, sort of.  Mm-hmm.  Basically, XM hired a limo.  Yeah.  To pick us up and bring us down to the photo shoot in the meatpacking district.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  I told you he was buff.  Is that Carrot Top?  Bill Byrne was just leafing through, what, FHM? 
[00:15:30]  Yes.  The latest issue of FHM.  And as Anthony and I are doing our little banter here, and he came upon a page where  it shows Carrot Top without a shirt on, lifting, doing some curls.  With a little bit of his pubes hanging out.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  Yeah, and a V and all that shit.  And it says, buff Carrot Top.  He's on roids.  This is what you have to do to compensate for the fact that you use props.  Right.  He could just write some jokes.  There's no need for all of this. 
[00:16:00]  Do his pants have to be, like, hanging off?  That's like Carrot Top's fucking...  Yeah.  You don't want to see his pubes.  It's a horrific shot.  Ugh.  It's a horrific shot.  Like, the guy's in shape, but why did he have to pull his pants down?  All the way down to his pubes.  And Bill Byr just, in disgust, throws the magazine toward me so I can see the picture.  Thanks, Bill.  Appreciate it.  How in shape do you have to be?  I'm going to give you a nice glass of sour milk after the break, so you can feel like 
[00:16:30]  I feel right now.  Jesus.  Anyway, where were we?  Talking about the limo that they hired.  Now, it might sound on the outside here like, you know, a limo, it's a big deal.  Limos used to be a big deal.  Yeah.  In the old days.  I want to tell you something.  You know, I'm sure there's people that own limo companies listening to us now.  I'm sure there are people that ride in limos from time to time that are listening to us 
[00:17:00]  right now.  I've got to go on record.  I fucking hate limos.  Yeah.  There's only one seat that's good.  They're big carsick machines.  There's only one seat that's good.  It's the one facing, you know, forward.  All the other seats make me absolutely sick to my stomach.  On a long drive somewhere, good idea.  If you're in the city, stop and go traffic.  He's got to make the big wide turns on the streets and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Horrid to drive in.  They really are. 
[00:17:30]  I'd rather not just jump in a cab.  And you know what?  And the limo driver's just not nice.  No.  The ones I've had in recent years.  No.  It's just not nice.  Years ago, Opie, when I used to go to the Oscars with Groucho Marx, the limo would come  and pick us up.  Now, years ago.  Did you ride in the rumble seat?  Yeah, they would pop up the rumble seat in the back if the weather wasn't too inclement.  It was a special thing, a limo ride.  Now, like, I would say a majority of the people out there have ridden in limos. 
[00:18:00]  It's not that big a deal.  Puke stains from prom nights.  Yeah.  It's proms.  It's bachelor parties, things like that.  I love when people, you can tell it's their first time they ever rode in a limo and they're  hanging out and waving to you like you actually believe that they're rich.  And they own the...  This is their car.  They own it.  I would like when they're all, like, standing up like...  Like, you always see, like, there'll be, like, five girls, like, standing up under the sun.  Through the sunroof.  Right.  I always want to just see them, like, rear-end the car in front of them just to watch everybody  just bend in half and crack their spines. 
[00:18:30]  Limos.  Limos still good for proms.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  You got a lot of people going to the airport.  People take a limo.  Somebody turns 21.  You're all going to drink.  Yeah, you drink.  You don't want to drive.  Or maybe you got great tickets for the Billy Joel show.  You take a limo to the...  Yeah.  A bunch of your friends, you all want to pile into a limo because you got that big concert  ticket.  Yeah.  That big concert you're all going to that you've been excited about for six months.  It's not...  Maybe you rent a limo.  There are lots of limos out there and the prices have gone down for them. 
[00:19:00]  It's not like years ago where only celebrities, sports figures, things like that got limos.  That's what I'm saying.  And there was a time when you rented a limo or had a limo sent for you.  You felt like somebody.  You felt like a star.  The driver treated you.  Yeah.  Like somebody who deserved to be in his car.  The driver doesn't want to be there.  The man had a cap.  He thinks he's better than you.  The limo cap and the little suit.  You wouldn't make eye contact. 
[00:19:30]  Like Bitterman from Arthur.  Bitterman, take me around the park.  That guy had the nice hat.  Right.  The jacket.  Right.  Opens the door for you.  Right.  Now, the limo companies also own the black cars.  Just the town cars and things like that.  And these drivers are all...  They're not exclusive to the limo.  It's probably a cabbie that on his time off drives the limo and the town cars.  So there's nothing special going on there.  Which, again, is fine by me.  I could give a shit if the guy says two words to me. 
[00:20:00]  Just get point A to point B as comfortable as possible.  The guy that was driving the limo yesterday, one of the most nasty, obnoxious drivers I've  ever had, ever, ever, in a cab, town car, limo, anywhere.  Right.  Even a few assorted drunk friends growing up.  More obnoxious than that.  I got your quote, but before we get there, I saved it on the BlackBerry here.  So he picks me up first. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  At my fine abode.  Mm-hmm.  And I walk out.  Lindsay and I walk out of the apartment.  Oh, you got on the prep sheet.  Cool.  And he jumps out of the car without even saying anything else.  He goes, you got a credit card?  Yeah.  You got a credit card?  First words out of his mouth.  I'm like, what?  You got a credit card?  We need an imprint of a credit card.  I'm like, well, nice to meet you, too.  That's the first thing he says to me.  Yeah.  I'm like, no, I don't have a credit card.  Credit card.  Credit card.  He goes, well, I'm supposed to get an imprint of a credit card right away. 
[00:21:00]  I'm like, I'm not giving you my credit card.  Sorry.  This was set up through XM, and when we get to this photo shoot down in the meatpacking district,  they'll take care of you.  Don Wicklin will come down, and you can imprint his card.  So were you guys a little put off that he didn't recognize your celebrity?  No, I don't give a shit.  Exactly.  We've never given a shit about that.  He should have came down with your headphones still on.  Yeah.  He realized that you wouldn't read it.  Honestly, I don't think this guy would give a shit anyway.  So then he's all huffy-puffy, and he barely opens the door. 
[00:21:30]  I don't even need the guy opening the door, but he's attempting.  I'm like, ugh, and I just get into the limo, right?  And right there, I'm like, why didn't I take a cab?  Why didn't I take a cab?  Why didn't I take a cab?  Over and over again in my head.  It just threw me in a horrendous mood.  And we had a very important thing we had to do yesterday, right?  And as far as a cab, I could have just shot right down to the meatpacking district.  I would have been there in 10 minutes, no joke.  But I was in that limo for an hour, for a fucking hour, because now we have to pick  up Anthony at the Park Meridian, which is right across the street here, right? 
[00:22:00]  But unfortunately, picking up Anthony means going all the way down to the East River to  turn back around to get to the west side of Manhattan to get down to the meatpacking district.  Yeah.  Kind of out of the way.  Is it a stretch?  Yeah.  Well, what the guy should have done, whatever.  If the guy knew what the fuck he was doing, there was another way to get to the hotel.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  It's not Anthony's fault.  Right.  So then we get to the Park Meridian, and Anthony's waiting there. 
[00:22:30]  And he jumps in.  And then what happens?  Well, again, he goes, I need credit card.  I need credit card.  Because now he thought that he was going to get the imprint at the Park Meridian.  Yeah, when they picked me up.  And I said, no.  No, when we get to the place we're going, Don Wicklin is there, and he will give you the  credit card.  I cannot go anywhere without the credit card.  I get it.  Dude, just go, and you'll get it.  Don't worry. 
[00:23:00]  You'll get it when we get there.  And now he's raising his voice.  He wants a fucking credit card.  Now, the point is, you're picking up passengers to take them somewhere in a limo.  You'll be taken care of.  We're not going to get to where we're going, all get out and go, ah, ah, and point at them  at laughing and run away.  You know?  We're not that tough.  We're not fucking on a prom here.  We're like, does this guy honestly think we're going to just ditch him as soon as he drops  us off at our final destination?  What's the big deal?  And everything was taken care of through XM. 
[00:23:30]  It was already paid for.  Credit cards.  All right.  But this guy just couldn't understand anything else but credit card.  Credit card.  So, see, people are killing us on the phone.  Fuck them.  They're killing us on the phones already.  Fuck them.  Trevor in Atlanta.  Trevor.  Hey, buddy.  How are you guys doing today?  All right, Trevor.  Go ahead.  Hey, I was just wanting to call and say, you know, I just started a limo company about  two months ago.  Yeah.  And it's going off to a very slow start.  Yeah.  And, you know, you guys are just scaring the hell out of me. 
[00:24:00]  You're talking about how bad the limo service companies are.  Just get good drivers and you'll be fine.  That's right.  Well, no, I'm the only driver, so, I mean, we do professional service and everything, so  I'm just trying to say that, you know, not everybody's like that.  They need to, you know.  All right.  What's the name of your company, sir?  It's Gold Coast Limousine Service in Atlanta.  Gold Coast in Atlanta.  You sound like a nice guy.  Good luck to you, Trevor.  We've got to move on to Nate in Brooklyn.  Hey, Nate.  Good morning, guys.  What's up?  Mr. Kumi and Mr. Hughes, I'm feeling real sympathy for you guys. 
[00:24:30]  You asshole.  The champagne wasn't bubbly enough, too.  Hoo-hoo.  Well, it's, yeah, I understand.  Is there anything else we can get you this morning?  Look, I don't like, but I don't like limos.  No, I know what I like.  Club Soda Kenny drive me around, because he gives us a special treatment.  He really does.  This is something that, yeah.  We're going to be treated, if we want to be treated right, we know how to do that for ourselves.  So as soon as you get a third party involved and stuff, it's just always a disaster.  I really should have just jumped in the cab.  It would have been no big deal. 
[00:25:00]  So then the guy.  This is something, though.  I know people are going to be calling up and bashing us, which is fine.  That's part of the program.  But this is something that has nothing to do with who we are, what we do for a living, what we make.  This is anyone that could have just been out a night with their fucking family in a limo.  This is the exact same thing.  Picture your...  Are you trying to relate to the common man?  Yes, I'm relating to the common man.  Because not all of these son of a bitches are homeless fucks that just stand there on the side of the road with snot coming out of their nose trying to squeegee a windshield for a buck. 
[00:25:30]  That's right.  I know a few of you actually do go out.  A couple, maybe two or three, have gotten a limo with their family and gone out for a night.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  I'm not saying this is like a nightly thing when me and Opie catch our limo home every night and we get an obnoxious driver.  Actually, this is a very rare thing for us.  It is.  It's a very rare thing.  This guy was fucking obnoxious.  Just like you.  A complete ass. 
[00:26:00]  So now we're out front of the hotel and he's yelling for the imprint of the credit card again.  Okay?  He won't leave.  Now he's like, I can't go.  I won't leave.  Now Opie's threatening to get out and get a cab.  I grab my bag.  I'm like, I'm fucking out of here.  I'm going to go get a cab.  I'm out of here.  And I start leaving.  Now I have to just snap into the voice of reason for a second and go, Opie, to get a cab now is going to take you so long that this is ridiculous.  I'll give the guy my card. 
[00:26:30]  He can imprint it, whatever the hell he's doing.  And then when we get back over there, Don Wickey can come out and take care of this.  And I had best not be charged, but, you know, we'll just at least get on our way.  Don Wickey, listen to me, Don Wickey.  Scooter Libby.  So I give him the card.  He does whatever he's got to do.  I probably got 18,000 calls to Bangladesh on the thing now.  Who knows?  And he gives me back the card.  Very rudely, by the way. 
[00:27:00]  Very rudely.  He's rude the entire time, like loud and just not.  How do you rudely give back a credit card?  Fling it.  And then he flings it at Opie.  And then he goes, now, where are we going?  Where are you going?  Now, where are we going?  I want to make sure we're on the same page.  He's got not even, he didn't even say that at first.  He just goes, where are we going?  And Opie goes, you have it on a sheet of paper.  It's right there in front of you.  He goes, and he holds up the paper.  He goes, I know.  I just want to make sure we're on the same page.  It's like, I'm like, I'm out of here. 
[00:27:30]  And I'm going for the door again.  And Anthony's like, just no.  Because now we'll never make the photo shoot.  And now we have to be there for only a certain amount of time.  I just lost my mind.  That was the snapping point right there.  Anthony said he was the rudest guy he's ever.  I go, sir, you're one of the rudest motherfucker drivers I've ever had in my life.  I go, just drive to where the address says on the paper.  Just drive.  And can I quote you now?  What quote? 
[00:28:00]  Well, after you did your quick rant where you're really blasting him, then you ended  it with, shut the fuck up and close the partition.  I don't want to see your fucking face.  That's an exact quote from Anthony Cumia.  I might have said that.  Shut the fuck up and close the partition.  I don't want to see your fucking face.  Which immediately got me to laugh hysterically right in the guy's face.  That is an exact quote.  What did he do?  Now I'm in a great mood again. 
[00:28:30]  He shut the fucking partition and he shut his fucking face.  I wish I had a mic in the front of that.  Yeah, I know.  Fucking infidels.  Oh, I'm sure he was just...  Oh, I should have brought my belt with the explosives.  He was fuming.  He had black in him.  Why do you keep doing that voice?  Because he had some kind of thing going.  It was a...  I don't know.  He was either Dominican, Haitian, Egyptian.  I couldn't tell.  I couldn't tell.  Jesus Christ.  He weren't no white guy.  Let's say hi to the hat. 
[00:29:00]  Can you use the right accent so I can get the correct racist picture in my head?  Yeah, it's just something.  Let's say hi to Rich.  It's something other than normal.  We've got to hurry this along because the FHM people got to go.  But let's say hi to Rich real fast.  Rich?  Yeah, that's me.  A limo.  What?  Oh, yeah, you know, you can't blame the limo driver.  You'd be surprised how many times limos get ripped off in the city by people just jumping  out of cars.  Dude, it was paid for.  It was already paid for.  It's not like we hailed the guy. 
[00:29:30]  The thing was paid for.  The credit card was XM's credit card.  It was already used and paid for.  Yeah, but if the guy was asking for your card, then obviously the dispatcher didn't give  him all that information.  It's mostly...  Oh, so that's my problem.  So I'll call the fucking dispatcher next time.  I think this guy's making a good point.  The guy's an obnoxious son of a bitch.  We told him.  We said, look, the credit card is on the other end.  We had Don on the phone.  He could have given him the fucking numbers.  Don was on the phone, and the guy goes, it won't help me.  I don't talk to anybody.  Most companies, they will not roll unless they get the card. 
[00:30:00]  Well...  No, not most companies.  Come on, this guy knows the lingo.  Not most companies.  They won't roll.  We do a credit card job.  We don't get the card.  We will not roll.  Yeah, well, you know something?  I have never seen that in my life.  Have fun then, man, because I'm done with this stupid limo.  What's the name of your place, dude?  Huh?  Not a brother, I'd say.  Exactly.  Yeah, of course.  Exactly.  You're a very smart man, because I don't bash it.  You don't have pests calling you all day.  The deal is, XM was trying to do the right thing and treat us real nice yesterday, and 
[00:30:30]  it was just a fucking nightmare, man.  You know, if you step into a limo, you should be treated nice, and everything should be set  up all nice for you.  Nicey nice.  That's all I'm saying, you know?  I'm not trying to cop an attitude here.  People know me on this show.  I don't jump in limos and stuff.  But I'm like, ah, it's a nice thing.  Let's do this.  But as soon as I left my apartment and the guy's right in my face looking for a fucking  credit card and an imprint, that's bullshit and bad business.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  It's just bad business.  You know? 
[00:31:00]  You want to relax and enjoy yourself.  That's not relaxing and enjoying yourself.  I think it's karma.  When my pal Anthony has to say, shut the fuck up and close the partition, I don't want to  see your fucking face, you know there's a problem.  I think it was karma.  Karma?  Yeah.  All right, listen.  Do you gouge the XM system?  Oh, we gouge the system for our clothing.  Clothing, yeah.  Yeah.  Indicative of the corruption at the CEO level of this country right now.  Hey, do we have pictures from the photo shoot up anywhere?  I think you guys got any of them you deserved.  I don't know. 
[00:31:30]  We're getting them.  We're getting them?  All right, that's fine.  Let's get the FHM people in here.  They only have until 745.  This is pretty huge, man.  They're announcing Miss FHM on our show.  And it's Lauren.  Lauren Harris.  Hi, Lauren.  How are you?  Hi, good.  How are you?  We're much better now.  You smell very, very nice.  Better than the carrot top picture.  Yeah, you see the carrot top picture in there?  No.  In the same magazine you're featured in?  No, I did not.  It's a carrot top buff.  He's a workout fiend.  He's being known more these days for his muscles than he is for his act. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, he carries the trunks out now.  Puts them on one of his freckled shoulders.  One on each shoulder.  Two big, heavy trunks.  We're trying to find it for her, but I'm trying to find it.  You've got a big day ahead of you, right?  Yes, I do.  She was just announced Miss FHM, Anthony.  And the pictures they got of you in the magazine are just...  There you go.  Does that do anything for you?  Oh, there you go.  Oh, wow.  I think carrot top is going to...  His act is going to be...  He's going to grow one of those handlebar mustaches and lift one of those big weights up with the big balls on either end. 
[00:32:30]  Say 100 pounds.  In one of those oldie-style bathing suits.  Shave his head.  Yeah.  What do you think of the tattoos of steamships?  He's going to perform down Coney Island.  What do you think of the carrot top?  He's big.  Yeah.  I don't remember him being that big in the commercials or anything.  No, no.  Of course not.  We think he's on the roids.  Is he going to hook up with him?  No.  What if he came up to you with his jeans all low-slung like that? 
[00:33:00]  Hinting at his pubic line?  I know.  The pants could really be pulled up a little bit.  They could be pulled up at least a foot.  He tried to say the reason why they're down that far is because he has no ass.  He's like, dude, you have a belt.  Yeah.  That's not what happened to belts.  Now, how were you chosen?  Well, it was a contest.  Oh, look at her.  I see.  I know it's obvious.  I don't even need to see who you're up against.  You should have won.  There were 64 girls, and it was broken down like the college basketball grid. 
[00:33:30]  And then it went girl against girl.  Yeah.  And then the winner would advance to the next level.  And then they chose four girls.  So, it was the final four, and they just chose me.  Did you get to do an argument with anybody?  No.  We all got along.  You all like each other?  Yeah.  It's not like, you know, nothing like that going on.  Was it just based on your shots, or did you have a talent competition or anything?  No, it was just pictures.  Because I see you have a tongue ring, so. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  I got it pierced a while ago.  I forget I even have it.  Yeah.  Sounds like you've had it a while.  I like the girls that just get them.  Yeah.  She's so sexy.  I did it because I knew it would be very sexy.  Yeah.  You could kind of talk around it.  Doing a good job.  Thanks.  What, uh, what, are you a single girl?  Yes, I am.  Oh, how about that? 
[00:34:30]  Bill.  Why are you going to Bill with that?  I don't know.  Are you going to go to Hawke?  Because I don't have a little horse chef on the side.  Is that what it is?  I didn't, I don't either.  Anthony hasn't.  This man is like in a committed relationship and he has a chef that he bangs on the side.  I do not.  When he gets, gets up to, you know, to get his midnight snack.  It's not a living.  What is it?  Ann B. Davis in my house?  It's not a living.  A chef is a guy.  It's a woman that comes in.  No, a chef is a man and he's, he wears clogs and he's balding. 
[00:35:00]  That's a chef.  Like that Wolfgang Puck guy.  All right?  You got some broad in your house making your sandwiches.  You're banging her.  She's not making it.  She cooks for the week.  And then I don't have to worry.  That's how it works.  Oh, yeah.  She cooks for the week.  She cooks.  Let me tell you something.  So now what happens now that the, while these guys argue, I'll try to talk to the.  How many piercings does she have?  I'll try to talk to.  No.  To Lauren.  So now what happens?  Now that you've been picked Miss FHM, what are your duties?  Well, I'm going to be making appearances at parties and events. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, those things are good.  Yeah.  What does that entail exactly when you make your appearance?  She just has to look hot, right?  Yeah.  Just greet everyone.  Be friendly.  Meet any creeps.  I guess.  I don't know.  Take pictures with.  Take pictures with people.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  Say hi.  You know.  Appear in the magazine a couple more times.  Is it exhausting?  No.  So I love it.  It's fun.  Yeah.  This guy trying to like fuck with you at all? 
[00:36:00]  No.  Not at all.  He's a young go-getter.  Young go-getter.  He really seems like he's totally in control.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're working your way up the corporate ladder, aren't you?  Nodding.  I'm the background guy.  All right, man?  Leave me alone.  We've never seen a suit this early in the morning, so you freaked everyone out around  here.  You know that, right?  Huh?  You thought there was a problem or something.  He's like dressed perfectly.  Dude, loosen up a little bit.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  I thought a lawyer was in the office for something we had done. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, there's a picture of you in the magazine where you're pouring champagne on your chest.  Yes.  We're trying to figure out what that means.  What that symbolizes.  It's a celebration.  A celebration?  Because I won.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Wow, good one.  Rather than sipping the champagne.  Yeah.  You just pour it on your chest.  It's just you having fun?  Yeah.  All right, because we're just trying to figure it out.  See, I was drinking there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, you're not.  You're fake drinking, and it's falling all over your fine body.  Yes. 
[00:37:00]  You're wasting good champagne.  Spilling down about your chest and stomach area?  Always got to ask.  Sometimes this gets a little awkward, but first, do you have parents?  Yes.  Have they seen this?  Yes.  Are they happy with it?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  They've got to be very happy.  Sometimes it gets a little awkward.  This isn't Playboy.  No, they're very, very supportive.  I know it's not Playboy, but, you know.  What do you do, Playboy?  It's a little phallic.  No.  No?  No?  No.  What if they offered you $1 million? 
[00:37:30]  I mean, come on.  I don't think about it.  No.  She's in there.  I mean, you're half naked in this.  Yeah.  That's why I think her parents have no problem.  She's still dressed in these pictures.  No.  She's half nude.  In these pictures.  What?  A dad?  A dad?  Huh?  A dad.  How does that work?  Like, you know, when you do the shot where, like, okay, me in the magazine, I can't see  your breasts, but it's clear that you're not wearing a bra.  How do they work that out with, like, the camera guys?  Do you kind of shuffle in with your back towards them?  Yes.  Or do they actually get a free little peek?  No.  We go around it. 
[00:38:00]  I had a top on right before that, and then when they were about to take the shot, I took  it off.  Not the answer I was looking for.  Wow.  Yeah, some girls, I guess, aren't shy, but you're a little shy, are you?  Yeah.  How many guys were on the little shoot there?  Not to belittle the magazine shoot.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, I bet.  Nice.  Nine of which had no reason to be there.  The guy with the camera, everyone else is just there for the show.  There's like six guys holding the boom mic.  And it's photographs. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  What do you need a mic for?  I really am a moron.  No, you're not.  So, you're doing a lot of publicity today?  You're going on Fox and Friends, right?  Yes, I am.  We know those guys over there.  Oh, yeah.  They're friends of the show.  Yeah, they'll like you.  They'll treat you very nice over there.  Have you ever done TV or any of that?  No.  Any radio?  Yes.  What show?  Well, I'm from Jersey.  So, I was on The Jersey Guys before.  Ah, right. 
[00:39:00]  The Jersey Guys.  Yeah.  We know them.  We know them.  We used to work with one of the guys when he was just doing sports and he was very boring.  And then he learned a lot from the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, really?  And now he does a show that's very similar to ours.  And he's making believe it's all about him.  It's a lot of fun.  But we won't.  Thank you, man.  Oh, I thought you were trying to.  Oh, Bill pulled it away from you.  I thought he was reaching over trying to get the magazine.  Bill pulled it away from him.  That's great.  Yeah, you're obsessed with the champagne. 
[00:39:30]  Look at that.  Somehow it just keeps messing your mouth.  It's not suggesting anything.  It's not suggestive whatsoever.  You've got to work on that.  A drinking thing.  It's like an airplane.  I have a drinking problem.  How did you get all that champagne off you?  That's where the 10-man camera crew came to play.  Scrub brushes.  Wow.  I had a towel.  Did you do modeling before this?  A little bit.  Not really that much. 
[00:40:00]  What did you do?  Just different like hair shows and promotions and stuff like that.  Ever like, you know, real job kind of thing?  I know.  This is very rough.  We say the same thing.  We're like, yeah, radio.  Very tough to do.  Not really.  FHM is the first big nationwide magazine I've ever been in.  Yeah?  So, yeah.  No work at a diner or anything?  Hostess at an Applebee's.  I was a waitress.  Yeah?  Waitress?  Mm-hmm.  That stunk, right?  Yeah.  Awful.  Food service business. 
[00:40:30]  Can't just take a break anytime you want.  It's like shit coming in and out.  You just stop every so often and go, fuck it, I'm going to be a model.  That's what you've got to do.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm glad it worked out for you.  Thank you.  I know you guys got to get off to Fox and Friends.  Yes.  It's Lauren Harris, Miss FHM 2005.  And the champagne bottle.  Declared hottest girl next door?  Mm-hmm.  To what?  Yeah, to what is exactly right? 
[00:41:00]  She got the girl next door look.  I hate that whole the hottest girl next door thing.  The girl next door look.  There's girls like her and I living next to me.  And I've lived in at least 15 different locations over the years because of the stupid radio show.  That's why she's special.  It's usually an old lady in a house coat.  Did you ever have neighbors?  You know what?  That's true.  And the same thing you get on a plane.  Did I ever have neighbors?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  She lived next door to somebody.  Oh, that's a lucky guy.  Yeah, but you get on a plane.  Yeah.  A person comes to sit next to you. 
[00:41:30]  They're never good looking.  No.  Did you ever have a hot neighbor?  A hot neighbor?  No.  Actually, I'm part of the problem.  I wasn't even thinking that.  The person sitting next to me is disappointed, too.  But that whole girl next door.  Yeah.  The hottest girl next door.  Well, that's why it's special.  You have girls next door.  You ever lived next door to a girl?  Yes.  All right.  That's the girl next door part.  They've all been horrific.  Now they've got to be hot.  They've been horrific.  That's why it's special. 
[00:42:00]  There's horrible things wrong with that.  If everyone that played Lotto won, you'd win your money back.  I guess.  Do people live next door to you?  Do you ever catch them looking out their windows?  No.  Trying to look into yours?  No.  No peeping toms or anything?  No.  I don't have any of them.  Did anything crazy happen?  No.  Give us something.  There was no fighting at the beauty pageant.  No, we all got along.  Sunbathing at the pool, maybe, and the neighbor's eyeball looking through a knothole in the fence. 
[00:42:30]  Not that I know of, but sure.  Restraining orders.  Yeah.  Any restraining orders in your life?  No.  Gotta be.  Not yet.  Wow.  Any jealous ex-boyfriend who didn't want you to go this career and wanted you to stay in  the diner?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, because of an ex-boyfriend, I'm here today.  So, that's how it all got started.  Why?  What did he do?  He took your picture and sent it in?  No.  Did you?  There's a part in the magazine called It's Yours.  It's Your Ex-Girlfriend.  Yeah.  And my best friend and I, we dated the same guy in high school. 
[00:43:00]  Unbeknownst to each other?  No, well, we didn't like each other in high school.  So, after high school, we became, like, best friends.  So, we thought it'd be funny to just, like, send in our picture, not really thinking anything.  And we got a call immediately.  And next thing I know, we were in New York for the photo shoot.  Now, when you sent the picture, were you pouring, like, probably Kool-Aid because  the budget was a little lower?  No, no, no.  No.  It was just a photo of us in our bikinis laying out by the pool. 
[00:43:30]  On top of one another?  Good.  No, just next to each other.  And what about your friend's picture?  Just the girls next door.  Just hanging out.  No, we were both together at my pool.  Now, were your bikini bottoms as low as Carrot Top's pants in that picture?  I don't think so.  His are pretty low.  All right, we got to wrap up.  Oh, they got to go.  That's the cut sign, because you got to get to Fox and Friends.  All righty.  Tell them we said hi.  They love us.  Okay.  It's Lauren Harris, Miss FHM 2005. 
[00:44:00]  Thanks for stopping by.  All right, thank you, guys.  Thank you.  There she goes, Lauren.  And we'll take our first break and continue with the Opie and Anthony Show in just a bit.  Tell me that I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip him out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip him out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Anthony Famous.  Get infected.  Weets.  You know the soup Nazi from Seinfeld? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He has a soup place here in the city.  Just opened up.  And what's the headline?  Soupy sales.  Yes, Jimmy.  Soupy soup dash Y.  Soupy sales.  But that's not enough for the story.  Forty minute wait as Nazi does a bisque business. 
[00:45:00]  Broth brown shirts couldn't be nicer.  Look at that.  That's cute.  That's cute.  Didn't they slaughter six million people a few years ago?  But now it's soup Nazi.  No, it's just cute.  It's very cute.  Not just a lion waiting for soup.  No dignity for you.  You know, and then they take your clothes and fillings.  Yeah, this whole thing.  Why?  Where is the outrage?  It's just a bunch of people waiting online for the soup Nazi. 
[00:45:30]  Soup Nazi.  Has anyone ever?  And one big line.  Seinfeld got away with everything.  Well, that's not even bad that he called.  They call him the soup Nazi.  Because Nazis become this word being you're a ball buster.  You're an irritant.  But the paper to do.  Here it says broth brown shirts.  Brown shirts.  Couldn't be nicer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, now that's really bringing it in beyond just the term that Nazi has taken.  Like Jimmy said, it could be a ball buster.  This guy's a real fucking Nazi to work for.  But bringing, like brown shirts.  Yeah.  That's bringing it in, you know, to the traditional term Nazi. 
[00:46:00]  How about people, quote, showered, unquote, with good soup?  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  You can't crystal knock this soup.  Anyway.  And they're trying to keep the holocaust of it down.  Why?  Is that any different than what they're doing?  No.  Oh, it's okay.  That's just it, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio on this fine Whip 
[00:46:30]  Them Out Wednesday.  Oh, it is Wednesday. 
[00:47:00]  A lot of new listeners joining the program.  Thanks to DirecTV.  Yep.  That deal went into effect yesterday.  We're being heard in, well, potentially, I don't know, we're being exposed to something  like 15 million homes.  Brand new listeners.  We'll get a little piece of that pie.  We've got to start all over with them now.  And this audience will grow that much more.  Whip Them Out Wednesday is a great, great concept.  It's brilliant, I must say.  Yes, it is.  Because we're still talking about it eight years later.  Eight? 
[00:47:30]  Maybe nine.  I think nine.  When did we start?  Like 96, 95?  Maybe 96.  23 years ago it was.  I remember.  And the concept is so easy, man.  There's ladies out there, man.  They are sluts.  They will show you their boobs.  Oh, jeez.  We discovered this one day.  It's an amazing little thing.  They're just not shy.  Just average girls.  Soccer moms.  The girl going to her business job there in the business suit. 
[00:48:00]  The junior high bus.  Huh?  The junior high school bus.  I think the regular girls show their boobs more than like strippers.  Strippers going to work, I don't think they're showing their boobs.  That's their...  Waitresses, soccer moms.  They're showing their boobs, guys.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Don't ask how we figured this out, but we figured it out many years ago.  Yeah, they just like doing it.  That's right.  And so what you have to do, because, you know, they want to make sure that you're going to  be appreciative.  They're looking for the cars out there that have wow on them.  Yep.  That's all it is.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:48:30]  Wow.  You got the official sanctioned sticker, or do you just write it in the dirt in the  back of your truck?  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  It's just got to be there.  And some guys, they just make homemade wow signs.  Those are good, too.  Mm-hmm.  And there's ladies out there that want to be wowed, too.  That's called lesbianism.  Yeah, not wowed by guys.  Don't start that.  Take out your bulls.  Well, that has been known to happen.  We just don't sanction that one, okay?  But that has been known to happen.  How do you drive? 
[00:49:00]  I don't know.  Put your nutsack hanging out.  How do you have that?  Pull out your sack Tuesday night?  No.  No.  Oh.  We have another thing.  Flapping in the wind as you're trying to, like, get your dick up to the window as you're  steering.  There was another thing we started, and I think we should bring it back because stupid  commercial radio took it away from us, if you remember correctly, Anthony.  What was it?  Hummer Tuesday.  Oh, that's right.  Hummer Tuesday was just starting to take off, and then the dumb lawyers got us behind a closed  door and said, uh-uh. 
[00:49:30]  Uh-uh.  We could have the women and the guys call us up, and the girls could give their man a  little hummer.  We're just trying to help the couples along out there.  So we dedicated a day to hummers.  Hummer Tuesday.  But we're talking about Whip Him Out Wednesday today.  Yes.  The official WOW stickers, you can get them by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope  to us here in New York City.  The address is 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  And we send off the WOW stickers immediately, okay? 
[00:50:00]  Right.  And that address is up on opianthony.com.  It works like a charm.  You slap the WOW on the back of your ride, and there are ladies out there that will flash  you as you're driving to and fro work.  Right.  And these things work even better when you're going to a sporting event, something festive.  It seems to work.  A concert.  Yeah, a concert when you're stuck in traffic.  It seems to work even better in those situations.  Well, you're getting the group of people that are more likely to flash.  Yeah, they're more in a party mode.  But it does work.  We hear from people all the time. 
[00:50:30]  We have a WOW line.  Maybe we'll see what's going on with that a little later today.  But it's great.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  We don't spend a lot of time with it on the air these days because we have so much else  to do.  But trust us.  It works.  Just get your WOW stickers and join the party, okay?  Right.  All right.  Bill Burr in studio helping us out once again today.  The FHM thing.  We understand.  We understand.  That was riveting.  Dude, man.  But these assholes with the instant feedback.  We know when the show sucks.  Stop.  Boring. 
[00:51:00]  Boring.  We get it.  She didn't have much to give and we only had like 10 minutes with her.  There's just no controversy.  She's a hot piece of ass.  Yeah, you need controversy or something.  She wasn't going to give up much info.  She's Miss FHM 2005.  She's going to be on TV all day today.  I've seen pictures with people.  Does that ever get boring?  No.  Yeah.  We were fishing around for something, you know.  Sometimes it just doesn't work.  You can't hook anything.  We were throwing out a bait out there.  Hey, any restraining order? 
[00:51:30]  Any, you know, neighbors peeking at you?  It's just something.  Right.  Yeah, you know.  We got nothing.  She's a cute girl.  Takes pictures.  There you go.  Well, where are you going to run with that?  But see, we know when we suck.  You don't have to remind us.  You don't have to remind us.  We get it.  It was boring.  Well, we're starting a relationship with FHM.  I saw that instant feedback.  There was a bunch of them.  No, I saw the one all in capital letters.  Oh.  The boring one.  Okay.  And that guy.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, now you're going to be fine.  Now another guy just did it. 
[00:52:00]  Banned.  I'm banning him right now.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  Caps equal banning.  That's right.  And did you have to spell yawn with 20 A's?  I mean, we get it.  We get it, Lucky.  Yeah, but you know, it's funny.  He kept listening.  We get it.  Asshead.  There are times that you just know you should go to Ethel for a little while.  Just go to Ethel or what else are the fine folks listening to? 
[00:52:30]  Maybe go to Top Tracks.  Ah, the guys, they're not going to get anything out of this broad.  I'm going to go listen to his Zeppelin song and I'll check him out later.  They're hoping.  We're fine with that.  They're hoping we do something, you know.  Well, you never know.  Beat her over the head.  Some of the greatest moments on this show start as a complete boar fest.  Today, not much of a payoff.  You just never know, though.  Pay off.  That's why they stick there.  But it's a payoff for the boys.  Yeah.  We're now going to be in a magazine.  See, we get pictures and exposure in a national magazine. 
[00:53:00]  See, it's a trade-off.  See, we sacrifice 10 minutes of our show.  We hoard ourselves out.  I was going to say, yeah, sold out a little bit.  We hoard the integrity of this program.  10 minutes of this program.  Hoard.  That's right.  The integrity of it.  I was wondering why I was on the spearhead of the, let's attack this girl.  Yeah.  You guys didn't go with it.  No.  Why would we attack someone that's going to give us a little...  See, this is how O&A make their own publicity.  That's right.  You've got to do things.  You've got to pay.  It's a trade-off. 
[00:53:30]  If our show, minute by minute, had a cash value, we just paid to be in a magazine.  That's right.  And you listeners paid along with us.  Arms for hostages.  At the expense of the listeners.  Yes, arms for hostages.  At the expense of the listeners.  They were bored to death, but our status just grew that much more.  We will never give money or give in to terrorism or arms for years.  And that was us just fucking paying. 
[00:54:00]  It's been a great show so far.  You guys started off complaining about your limo ride on the way to your photo shoot.  Then you're nice to this woman so you can get your pictures in a magazine.  Yeah.  What happened to this show in the last 24 hours?  We didn't sell out.  We bought in.  That's right.  We bought in.  That's it.  We bought into the system.  Bought in, son.  That's what we do now.  All right.  Celebrity Navigation System Audio.  We were having a lot of fun with this.  We were chuckling along in the office to some of these. 
[00:54:30]  Well, this is another one of these ideas that, I don't know, sounded great to a couple  of guys hanging out at a bar, maybe a few too many drinks at dinner, and decided, hey,  let's get some celebrities to do the voice of the navigation systems in the vehicles.  Yeah.  Because that's...  Because the regular, average, everyday Joe, who can't take a limo, would enjoy something  like this.  He would enjoy something like this, but doesn't even have a navigation system.  But there's...  Please.  There's these ideas that...  Hey, by the way...  Can he download it into his iPod? 
[00:55:00]  By the way...  Yes?  Fox and Friends will have Lauren on, the same girl we just had on, in minutes.  Let's see if they get anything out of her.  Now you set us up for some real failure.  Why?  You think they're going to get something good?  Fast forward, middle of the interview, she's crying in a fetal position.  Admitting everything.  Admissions of guilt and involvement with Al-Qaeda.  And she knows where Osama bin Laden is.  Texts with Bush.  All he had to do was ask me. 
[00:55:30]  I know.  I thought to do that.  He is.  We're going to get bin Laden soon, though.  You think?  Bruce Willis put up a million bucks.  Well, problem solved.  Problem solved.  The country itself is offering, like, what, 15 million?  Yeah, I think they pushed it up to, like, 100 or 75 or something.  Was it...  How much?  How much is the country?  I don't know.  It's a lot of money that we're offering.  Many more millions than Bruce Willis' one million.  But you think there's some just guy in Afghanistan that...  One million.  Bruce Willis?  You know, I... 
[00:56:00]  I always wanted to meet him.  He's guest-starring on that 70s show.  Yeah.  And he needed a little extra hype.  Needed a little boost.  Needed some hype.  Well, these publicists are coming out with all sorts of new ways to get their people in the press.  You kiss starving children in Africa.  That's the new thing to do.  Right.  You get a picture in all the hot magazines.  But you sacrifice 10 minutes of your program.  Oh, yeah.  Jessica Simpson.  Oh, yeah.  I guess we're guilty of the same thing.  But that's what...  Yeah, when are you guys going to do that?  Like, Angelina Jolie?  They're going to fly you over there?  Adopt some little black... 
[00:56:30]  Baby, bring him back over.  Shut jocks.  They care, too.  I'm going to be photographed with my new pet badger.  You're getting a badger?  I'm going to start a new trend.  Badgers.  I don't think that'll take off.  Why?  Parris Hilton's walking around with a stupid monkey now.  It's not even a monkey.  What is it?  It's from the raccoon family.  God, we're all over the place.  But trust me, we'll bring it all around.  This is our celebrity break.  It's cute but vicious.  The thing on Parris Hilton's shoulder. 
[00:57:00]  That is Baby Love, the Kinkachoo.  That's hot.  A Kinkachoo.  A five-pound rainforest mammal.  That's hot.  That's hot.  Shut up.  Fucking celebrities are walking around with rainforest mammals now.  That's hot.  It hangs out with the airhead heiress in Hollywood.  That's hot.  Airhead heiress.  The Kinkachoo is a nocturnal rainforest mammal found in Central and South America.  In the daytime, it crawls up her pussy.  It weighs five pounds to six pounds.  Plenty of room in there. 
[00:57:30]  It is related to the raccoon family.  That's hot.  The creature is a carnivore and has sharp teeth.  That's hot.  It is generally docile.  That's hot.  But can bite and scratch.  That's hot.  Also known as the honey bear.  It costs between $1,000 and $3,500.  Could you buy these?  And because the post has to be wacky, it's difficult to train, just like Parris.  Oh, I get it. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, boy.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  So, that's the latest trend, because Parris starts all the latest trends.  She started the little dog.  Yeah, what happened to the little dog?  The little wiener dog.  She gave away Tinkerbell.  Tinkerbell was the name of the little dog?  It was her little chihuahua.  Yeah.  Mini chihuahua thing.  And then it got too big, and she just tossed it aside, like, you know, a purse or shoe.  Or some other fashion accessory.  Probably was just some regular family. 
[00:58:30]  It's gone from flying in a private jet.  It's, like, in that luggage compartment on a Greyhound bus now.  Trying to keep its balance in there.  Little unsure legs.  Claws slipping on the plastic bottom when it makes a turn.  Yeah, because, you know, people see this shit in the magazines.  The celebrities walking around with the little dogs and stuff.  Britney had a dog, right?  Yeah.  But they don't think it's real.  But what happens to all these little dogs when these celebrities decide there's a new  trend out there?  When all of a sudden you're taking pictures as the paparazzi, and you notice the dog isn't 
[00:59:00]  there anymore.  Where's the dog?  Where's the dog?  Where's the dog?  Where is the dog?  Now where's the kanker-chew?  Well, the kanker-chew is...  It's got...  You know the thing just jacks off and throws its shit.  Because that is what all those things do.  That's hot.  That's hot.  I'm still trying to figure out why she's famous.  Because she's an heiress.  That's the only reason?  Yeah.  She's worked there.  She's worked being a rich, like, heiress. 
[00:59:30]  But there's a million of these heiresses out there.  Why is she famous?  I don't know.  Why is she famous?  How did this start?  Because she's willing to show a lot of skin.  And don't say The Simple Life, because it was way before The Simple Life that she was  famous.  She's an heiress slut.  You don't find many of those, I don't think.  Public slut.  Privately, they're probably banging a lot of those heiresses.  So she's famous for being an heiress slut.  Right.  In public.  Because there were times, like, we would be at places and there were rumors, the Hilton  sisters are going to be here.  They're showing up.  They're showing up.  I'm like, who the hell are the Hilton? 
[01:00:00]  I didn't know.  No.  But they're famous just for being hot sluts.  Hot, slutty heiresses.  It's kind of, you know, it's outside of what they're supposed to be.  They're supposed to be like, you know, the debutantes and, you know, taking over the  family fortune.  But those rich people are always the biggest freaks anyway.  Yeah.  But they follow...  Did you ever see Eyes Wide Shut?  Yes, I did.  Look what they were doing in that fictitious story.  But they follow her around 24 hours a day and she really doesn't have much to say. 
[01:00:30]  Much?  So then she has...  So then she comes up with these dumb gimmicks to keep the press and the paparazzi interest  in her.  She'll bang a car every once in a while.  She'll crash.  She'll crash a motorcycle every once in a while.  She'll get a weird animal to throw on her shoulder.  Her whole life is just doing things to get into the news.  To keep getting in the news.  But there's no reason for her to be in the news because she hasn't really done anything  newsworthy.  She's like Madonna without albums. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  She can't sing.  Doesn't have any talent whatsoever.  She just tries to get into the news and does a good job, I guess.  And they're so obsessed with her that there's going to be a Simple Life 4.  Bill and I were talking about this in the back office.  They had Nicole Richie on the Conan O'Brien show, right?  And they're talking about Simple Life 4 and they asked Nicole Richie, you don't like Paris  and you guys don't talk.  And Nicole Richie openly admitted, yeah, we don't talk.  I don't even want to see her.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  But that's not stopping the Simple Life from being on TV for another season.  Simple Life 4.  Yeah, but it's still going to suck because now that they don't get along, they should  have them interacting and you get to watch them hating each other, but they're just going  to be like separate.  How great would that be?  Is it true Nicole Richie said, shut the fuck up and close the partition.  I don't want to see your fucking face.  You're in a limo one day.  I think that's what set off the argument.  I believe it was something like that.  So they're going to film this show without the two hosts even talking to each other. 
[01:02:00]  That's how obsessed they are with Paris Hilton.  How is that going to work?  They're going to be like, you know, Nicole Richie's going to do her thing and then like  an announcer or something is going to come on and go, meanwhile, Paris Hilton, meanwhile,  later, at the Hall of Justice.  While this was going on, Paris had this going on.  So.  Why can't the director just step up and be like, can you two untalented whores who bring  nothing to the world just fucking talk to each other? 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Do you realize, yeah, where you're at here in life, what you actually do, what talent  you have and where you are and how lucky you are?  How about you just fucking talk to each other?  Yeah.  Cash a paycheck.  All right.  So getting back to the Mr. T thing, we're starting with Mr. T.  Oh, that's where we were.  Well, celebrity, just talking about the celebrities here today.  This is, I don't know, how many people out there have navigation systems in their car?  I know they're putting them in a lot of newer cars, even the economy models, getting the 
[01:03:00]  nav systems.  They talk to you.  You got a little map on the TV screen.  Are we keeping you up, Bill?  It tells you.  Sorry, man.  Geez, we all yawn.  We try to do it off mic.  Oh, did I yawn right here?  I see it all day yawning.  I'm like, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.  We started off with that boring story about the limo that regular guys like myself couldn't  relate to.  Regular guy.  We try to keep the illusion that we're wide awake.  I come in here with my lunch pail.  You know, I punch the little time card. 
[01:03:30]  You punch the clock.  Yeah.  To get that XM check that's coming any day now.  I punch the thing I've seen in movies that I've never seen in real life.  Fuck you.  I worked in a warehouse.  I know exactly what it looks like.  You worked in a warehouse.  Where?  House.  Up in Massachusetts.  Massachusetts.  What was in this warehouse?  Software.  Housing.  Software.  Software?  What did you do?  Drive the forklifts?  I unloaded the trucks and we didn't have a, we didn't have, back in my day, we didn't  have forklifts.  We had something known as a pallet jack. 
[01:04:00]  The pallet jack.  The pallet jack.  I hated the pallet jack.  The truck would back up and it would always be like an uphill thing and you'd be pulling  out your lower back.  It's like, it's one step above just pulling the pallets out with your bare hands.  Oh yeah.  You'd slide this thing.  It, it's kind of, they want you to think it's like a forklift.  It's got two forks on it and wheels and a handle.  And you, you have to run like as fast as you can just to get the forks into the pallet  because the wheels get caught on the wood and it's got to be set at the exact proper  height. 
[01:04:30]  It's like no power, it's like going from power steering to no power steering.  Yeah, no power steering.  You just like, you run full blast, bam, you hit it.  And then you got to jack the thing up with some kind of little pump handle.  And once it's off the ground, now it still weighs, there's no, no little pulley system  or any type of, it still weighs exactly what it weighed before you picked it up with this  thing.  But now it kind of has some wheels to it and you got to pull it out of this truck.  Any incline?  Yeah.  You ain't getting that.  No, huh?  It's not working.  What a thankless job. 
[01:05:00]  It's a fucking great job.  Oh, it's stunk.  Shut up.  I loved it.  You hated it.  No, it was great.  It was all the wise asses who fucked off in high school.  Fun to hang out with those people and stuff.  But those, did you work itself?  No career goals, so there was like no competition.  Just getting drunk every night.  Yeah.  No one had like, any of those jobs I had, no one had anywhere else they wanted to be.  No.  There was the old guy.  There was always the old guy on the job that you assumed had a dream sometime, but he's 
[01:05:30]  like 55, pushing 60, and he's like still doing this shit.  Oh, yeah.  And he's happy.  You know, he jokes around with the guys.  I worked with one of the old guys.  He was a Vietnam vet.  And he used to be one of those guys who would like literally during the course of the day  drink a case of beer and would completely be fine.  Had the same guy, used to drive the fucking truck with the sheet metal in it and drink  Schlitz Tallboys that he would like sneak into the truck.  And the whole way, I'm talking like maybe a 30, 40 mile drive with the sheet metal in 
[01:06:00]  the back.  And he's just drinking Schlitz.  Oh, yeah.  And you'd never notice.  I went out drinking him with like one time and it was like one of those deals.  The only time you're on the same beer is the first beer.  And then the rest of the time you had like literally have like a line of beers and you're  like just trying to suck this shit down.  And this dude is just like, you guys ready for another one?  This guy worked in like the, like the, in Vietnam.  He was like in the DMZ, you know?  Yeah.  He had one of those anti-aircraft guns that he had, he had pointed like horizontally and 
[01:06:30]  would just shoot into the fucking tree line.  We'd get him real hammered and get him to try to talk about those things.  Some Vietnam stories.  Hey, Frank, how many people do you think he killed?  And I don't like talking about that shit.  And we just fucking killed.  It had to be 80 gooks.  Yeah.  A few beers later.  80 gooks.  We called it air.  Yeah.  Air support.  Naped them.  All of them.  But none of these guys ever had like anywhere else they wanted to be.  Oh, yeah.  They were happy to be there.  They were looking toward like, like, hey, you think we're getting the raise?  You know, this, uh, they're negotiating the raises for the guys and supposed to be 
[01:07:00]  like, uh, 3% the first year and then, uh, 4% the second year.  And I'm looking at what my pay is and thinking what 3% of that is.  And it's like, we're fighting for, for scraps.  Oh, that's great.  You wouldn't miss any sporting event?  No.  You either went to it or you watched it?  Yeah.  You didn't have work to do in the next morning.  You unload trucks.  Yeah.  I got it.  I was mentally prepared for this job in third grade.  I can do it out till all hours getting smashed and just show up hungover. 
[01:07:30]  You know, it's funny.  I had absolutely no expenses.  I was making like, I think like 260 bucks a week.  I had absolutely, by Tuesday every week, I was just totally fucking broken.  Broke.  Absolutely nothing to show for.  Never went to the bank.  There was no bank in my life.  I took the money that I had.  I couldn't even, I had to go to the company's bank to cash my check because I didn't have  a bank to go to where it's like, and you learn that by going to some bank with your  check and go, I'd like to cash this.  Do you have an account here?  No.  Well, you can't cash it here. 
[01:08:00]  Well, how am I?  And then you get an attitude.  How am I supposed to fucking cash it or make an account?  I need the money now.  You can't use that language.  We're going to have to ask you.  I need the money now.  It's good.  Call the number on the check.  It's good.  And you're just like a dirt bag.  And I'd have to go to the company that I worked for, their bank, to cash the check,  and it would just end up this wad of cash in my pocket, and that's where it would stay.  And I'd go to the bar, and boom, you're buying shots, you buy your cigarettes, you buy whatever 
[01:08:30]  you need, and buy, yeah, Tuesday, Wednesday.  You'd play for the canteen truck to show up.  You'd eat that shit food.  You still somehow had a flat stomach because you're so fucking young.  You keep working out every day.  You played basketball during the break in your fucking tight 80s jeans.  Come back in dripping sweat.  Did you have credit with the coffee truck guy?  I didn't.  Other guys did.  I had credit with him, and it was like there was some weeks I'd have to hide and not eat  because the coffee truck guy would pull up, and I'd be well into him for quite a few bucks. 
[01:09:00]  But I had blown my money.  So now I can't get anything to eat because I have no money.  I can't get credit from the truck because I'm exhausted with my credit there.  And I'm hiding behind equipment, peeking out, waiting for him to leave as he's like with  his change thing on his belt, not making eye contact with anybody he's doing business  with, just looking around for me.  His head is spinning.  He's kind of looking.  And he's off, and then I'd see him.  Oh, you know, I was out on a job, and I'd pay him finally, and then I'd be broke. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, where's your friend Anthony?  He's cutting up boxes.  Yeah, he's around.  I don't know.  I saw him earlier.  Tell him I want to see him.  And then I'd get paid and have to pay the coffee truck guy, and then I'd be broke like  on payday.  That was the worst where you had some big debt, and then payday, and it's gone.  And now it's Friday afternoon, and you're broke.  You know, it's funny, too, you could actually, I had like two or three times there was like  physical fights amongst different employees, but because it's a warehouse, no one gets  fired.  You just go back to work, and guys, like all sweaty with their hair sticking up, fucking 
[01:10:00]  asshole.  Yeah, it's not like a real place of business.  Oh, yeah, there was this one guy.  Fucking prison yard.  This one guy worked who was just a raging, raging alcoholic, and he came in one time.  I swear to God, it was like 11.30 in the morning.  You're supposed to be there by 8.  And he comes in, his hair is soaking wet from a shower, and he tries to pull, oh, yeah,  the traffic was breaking.  It's like one highway.  We all came up there.  It's like, dude, you went out boozing.  And he's like, dude, shut the fuck up. 
[01:10:30]  Let's do one of those, right?  So we were making a run to Dunkin' Donuts, and they call him, hey, Paul, you want anything?  He's like, nah, I'm all set.  And my buddy goes, how about a rum cake?  And that was it.  Fucking on the mat, just going at it.  Hey, hey, hey, dunk it on, dunk it on.  Fucking change all over the floor.  And then you just went back to work.  We would have to check in every morning, and I'd get in my truck, and I was habitually  late, like every fucking day.  I could not get there on time, late every day. 
[01:11:00]  And you'd have to check in the second you got in your truck and you were driving in.  So I'd be still putting my shirt on and just grabbing at the mic.  Uh, 16 to base?  Yeah.  Base to 16, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm right around the corner, but I'm going to have to stop and get some gas.  Uh, yeah, truck needs gas.  All right, we'll see you when you'll get here.  Meanwhile, I have like no gas, but now I can't get gas.  I have to drive there, hope no one looks and notices I don't have any gas, because I didn't 
[01:11:30]  stop for gas.  Then I have to start this whole story with the fucking guy, with the gas, you know, he  pops the hood, looks for the old fucking oil.  I needed oil.  I'm like, dude, I got to get to work.  He's there with the tire pressure gauge.  Dude, wow, you got booze on your breath.  Oh, and it was every morning, like every morning.  Like I thought they were retarded.  Every morning there's a problem.  The traffic, I would use the traffic, or I would call in, uh, I'd be like, yeah, how 
[01:12:00]  are you doing?  No, no, I've been up for hours.  I've been up for hours.  Fine.  I got gravelly, hungover, drunk guy voice, obviously.  Oops.  I remember at any given moment, somebody had lost their license for drinking and driving,  and of course you would still drive, so you'd park your car behind the dumpster.  All this fucking hilarious.  I remember, I had this one job in this warehouse, first day I get there, like I thought the  last one was crazy.  Like this one was like, everyone there, like the first one was just like alcoholics, and 
[01:12:30]  I went to the next one, everyone was like cokeheads.  And I walked in there, what the fuck was this guy's name?  He was one of these guys like six foot seven, weighed like 111 pounds.  And he had like, you know the electronic pallet jack?  Yeah.  And he kept driving right to the edge going, I'm going to drive it off the dock!  And everyone was just kind of nervously laughing, and I'm sitting there, what the fuck is with  that guy?  We used to use some pretty like hardcore machinery in the sheet metal shop, big cutters, where 
[01:13:00]  you were taking sheets that were 10 feet by 5 feet long.  Oh, you worked in like the Bruce Springsteen fucking warehouse.  Oh, dude, it was just, it was, you're making the shit.  I'm going to cut up some steel.  Well, I'm cutting up some steel.  I'm hoping, Wendy, I'll get a big record deal.  It was just, it was one of those awful fucking Allentown bell, just horrid places to work.  And you're putting these big sheets of steel, these, what amounts to giant razor blades into 
[01:13:30]  machines and cutting them up into smaller pieces to be bent up into duct work, to be loaded  onto a truck, to be driven to a job, to be installed.  And that's what the fuck, what the job was all about.  And the machines we were working around, there was something called a brake.  You ever see ducts?  They're square.  How do you think you get that 90 degree bend in the sheet metal so nice and tight?  It's something called a brake.  I've often wondered that.  I'm sure you have.  You take a piece of flat sheet metal, put it in a brake, and it's a big wedge on this 
[01:14:00]  big V-shaped thing, and it hits the metal and, boom, bends it into a 90 degree angle.  And you do that a few times, and you have a square.  And we were running these machines drunk off our asses, just drunk and stoned.  Everyone in the shop.  There wasn't one person that at 12 o'clock rolled around, we didn't go to the bar and  OTB that was right next door, and just slam shots, bet a few horses, and go back and run 
[01:14:30]  this machinery.  You just did everything that's going to keep you in that job.  Yeah, exactly.  Right, right.  Exactly.  Nobody's buying a self-help book.  No!  How to get your money to work for you.  Nobody's doing that.  Fuck it!  You're betting horses with money you don't have, buying booze, and going back and working  with some of the most dangerous machinery.  There were things called clinch collars.  They're these round things that you'd have to put in the duct to then extend pipes off 
[01:15:00]  of that would go to the vents in the houses.  And they were stapled together.  Now, you've got to staple through sheet metal.  So, there are these giant Bosch staplers that are foot-activated.  And your fingers are like millimeters away from the actual mechanism.  Cha-coom, cha-coom, cha-coom, cha-coom.  And you're just stapling.  And every so often, bam, someone's thumb would get caught in there.  Finger.  And you'd laugh at them.  You'd just laugh.  Yeah, you're fucking stapled, you figure, asshole. 
[01:15:30]  It's a whole nother world.  A whole nother mentality.  Hey, we've got to go to the phones.  They've exploded.  A lot of people are relating today.  Carl in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Anthony, you're such a fancy man now that if you met yourself then, you'd be scared of  yourself.  You'd be scared of you.  I would be petrified of myself.  I would chase me away.  Corporate fuck.  Get away.  It's amazing how much Anthony has changed in the last 11 years.  Get away from me, you bum. 
[01:16:00]  Someone's just drinking Perrier sparkling water.  Yeah, I see that.  With a fancy shirt.  Like he just stepped off a fucking yacht.  I was at the hotel.  All right.  He's got a fancy shirt on and everything.  I am horrible.  They've got to photoshop the old Anthony with the new Anthony.  I have abandoned anything of the old me.  I've just abandoned it.  He is a chef.  It was, let me tell you about the hatred I had for that job.  Like I had a good time.  Like I understand what you're saying completely.  There were some people, some of the funniest motherfuckers I ever met, ever, were on job sites. 
[01:16:30]  They were hysterical.  Fucking laughed my balls off.  The job was thankless.  The work was just that you'd be on a rooftop and it's 100 degrees out.  The black tar roof is 120 degrees.  And you're with a sawzall, some guy telling you, cut a 10 foot by 10 foot hole in this roof because we landed a unit on there this afternoon.  And you're sitting there cutting through tar and gravel and sheet metal and precariously perched ladders that could kill you at any minute. 
[01:17:00]  It's just no safety, no nothing.  And you're constantly like sweating and working hard.  And it just sucked.  And then winter rolls around.  And now all the sheet metal is covered in ice.  And you've still got to put it in.  It was horrible.  I knew this was coming.  I don't look back fondly at the work itself.  Chris in D.C. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I just wanted to note here that it's quite obvious as if we all didn't know that, Opie, you haven't worked one honest fucking day in your entire life.  This 20-minute rant that Bill and Anthony are going on here.  And you're just sitting back quietly.  That's hilarious.  I've got a fucking thing to say.  You know, there are times when there's some nice conversation going on.  I want to be part of it.  And I'll try to get in and say something.  Or maybe direct the conversation.  I have no fucking clue.  Why don't you tell people how you caddied at the Crescent Club? 
[01:18:00]  I caddied at the Huntington Crescent Club.  That was Opie's regular job.  I caddied from when I was 12 years old to 26, maybe?  Sit down, Opie.  I was a caddie for 14 straight years.  I worked in a video store where I watched pornos with my friends.  And I got fired from that because I refused to turn the pornos off when other people were coming in to rent regular movies with their kids.  And I was a temp to hire for Xerox up in Rochester. 
[01:18:30]  Those were the only jobs I had.  And then I went into radio.  That's it.  That's it.  No warehouse or sheet metal.  No Bruce Springsteen jobs for you.  No, I was the guy.  I was in shipping for Xerox.  Yeah, but not shipping where you're loading trucks.  No, I had a lot.  You were the guy, the paperwork guy.  I was the paperwork guy.  Yeah, like a uniform.  No, no.  Fill something out, hand it to one of the men, and he will go and load this truck with the equipment. 
[01:19:00]  What was it called?  A dispatcher?  Oh, something.  I don't know.  Well, you're right.  Chris, you're right.  What can I tell you?  I wandered around America trying to get into radio while these guys were working their  asses off.  Good stuff.  Hey, have a good day.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, I never had a real job.  Let's say hi to Joker in California.  Joker.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Joker.  Hey, Anthony.  We used to work out there at a sheet metal in California.  I used to get up every morning, get high before we'd go to work. 
[01:19:30]  And I had a little axe to cut my ear off.  Your ear?  My left ear.  How did you cut your fucking ear off?  Maybe lifting a piece of metal?  That's exactly what it was.  Yeah.  The money of mine was supposed to be carrying the other end.  Oh, fuck.  I flipped around and dropped it, which meant my hand would go up and slice my ear off.  Oh, wow.  That rocks.  That is rough.  The worst day working there was when the sheet metal truck would come for deliveries, 
[01:20:00]  and they'd drop off a new load of sheet metal, and it had to be taken off one sheet at  a time.  So, you got me and my brother, or me and some other guy, poor son who's working there, some  other alcoholic.  You put on your gloves, these big heavy gloves, and take one sheet off at a time and hope that  every time you're not going to just cut your limb off.  You drop a piece of that metal, and it hits your leg or your shin or something like that.  Your leg will be sliced through like a razor blade, and that's what you're working with  on a daily basis. 
[01:20:30]  Razor blade.  Razor blade.  And any other kind of cuts you'd get every day, you'd cut yourself some way, shape, or  form.  You'd just hope it wouldn't be that serious that day.  I was making these L brackets to hang something off of once, and I hold on to one end of it,  and I'm drilling the other side, not realizing that when the drill screw catches, it's just  going to turn this thing into a handheld saw, because it's a little bracket that I made  out of sheet metal.  And I'm holding one end, and I'm drilling the other, and it caught and spun in my hand 
[01:21:00]  and just, still got it right there, wham, ripped through the palm of my hand.  And you know what you do?  You put some duct tape on it and finish what you're doing, and then maybe go to the hospital  and have them stitch it up.  See, I can't imagine that this is the same guy that would be doing all this.  Yeah.  That was it.  You know, this is a funny thing, is people are standing around asking if he's okay, people  are actually holding back, laughing.  Laughing.  You would laugh at the guys, and they'd hurt themselves.  Dude, you okay?  There were guys with the fucking nail guns. 
[01:21:30]  Because every day on the job, some idiot would slam one of those fucking nails through  a finger or his hand or something, and it's just, hey, Jesus, the nice fucking work.  He's got a nail through the palm of his hand.  You don't come here, we'll get the pliers.  You can pull it out.  No sympathy whatsoever.  None.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  What's up, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Billy.  I used to work as a electrician before I became a paramedic, so I actually had to work  for a living.  And on Fridays, we'd go to the bar, which is right next door to the electrical shop, 
[01:22:00]  and just get loaded up from like 4.30 to 7.30.  7.30 to about 9.30 was Fight Club.  We just, it started out just, you know, each of us getting into a fight with each other  over something stupid during the week, and it became a game.  The boss actually would referee the fight in the yard next door.  We'd go back to the yard and beat the shit out of each other.  I mean, hitting each other with like bales of wire and stuff, and it was the best job  I ever had, only for the fact that we did Fight Club. 
[01:22:30]  That did Fight Club on the job.  Healthy work atmosphere.  I had a guy, I had this guy, 6'6".  I was giving him shit, and I swear to God, he was like further away than you are, and  I turned my back and he hit me with a jab.  It was unbelievable.  I couldn't believe he caught me.  I thought I was like safe away.  Far enough away.  Oh, dude, he tagged me.  Sounded like the white lights for half a second.  I so respect what you guys did, because there's no human resources and all that bullshit.  If you had a problem with a fellow employer, you would take it. 
[01:23:00]  No, you duked it out.  You duked it out.  You made his life a living hell for a day or two.  It was how hockey used to be.  You couldn't run for human resources.  No.  We have to deal with that on radio all the time.  We say the wrong thing to someone, and they go running off to human resources.  The next thing you know, you're in meetings and all that bullshit.  No.  Not these guys that I do the radio show with.  You could keep your job just based on certain little talents that you had.  You didn't even have to really be good at it.  Like, I know I had a job because my license was clean. 
[01:23:30]  There were guys that couldn't drive.  They were great workers, but they couldn't drive to the jobs.  So, like, all right, go with Anthony.  We'll, you know, send you out to this job here today.  You know, I was one of the guys with a clean license, and I could make anything out of  eight-inch round pipe if I needed to.  I could just bend it flat and cut it with the snips.  And, like, you ever see those IQ tests where it's like, what would this folded up look  like?  You know, like a box.  Oh, I would have failed that miserably.  That was what my job was. 
[01:24:00]  I'd go to, like, Manhattan.  I'd come in here, and they'd send me into a brownstone where it was some custom job.  They didn't know what it was.  They'd send me in with metal and just go, we don't know what this lady needs.  Just make something.  And you'd have to look and measure and draw it out on a piece of sheet metal and then  cut it, bend it up, screw it together, and install it.  Yeah.  And that was, like, my talent.  I could do that.  You actually had a skill job.  Mine wasn't.  That was it.  No, it was cool.  Unloading boxes and putting the right stuff in.  That was years after the shop and the warehouse.  No, it was cool about Anthony when him and I started working together, and then we got 
[01:24:30]  to move, you know, back to New York to do radio.  We got to do a lot of cool things on commercial radio.  Oh, yeah.  And we would be driving around this fine city of Manhattan, and Anthony would be pointing  out all the buildings he worked in.  Oh, yeah.  You see that air conditioner on the top of that huge building?  I put that there.  I helped install that.  I think it's the size of a freight train car.  And we would be on the way to maybe a photo shoot or some crazy thing, and he would just  point out, you know, stuff he did in his other life. 
[01:25:00]  It's another life.  Every strip mall on Long Island, every one of those Rexon, friggin' Rexon office buildings  in Huntington and Melville, all those crawled around in every ceiling, every space between  the hung ceiling and the metal floor above it, I was in there crawling like an animal.  I did construction for like a week and a half is how long I lasted.  First of all, I sucked at it, and it was just, oh, it was brutal.  It is a rough work.  Plus, it was some dude, I swear to God, like every day, he'd be wearing, he had these jeans, 
[01:25:30]  and he had this, I don't know, I told this story before, he had this big hole in his pants  just to, I think, the right of his package.  And every day, I'm fucking standing there cutting something, and he comes walking by and  steps over something, and the hole goes right over his hole.  His whole fucking unit was hanging out.  Oh, that's great.  That's what you want.  Kevin in Connecticut, what's up, Kevin?  Hi, guys.  Anthony, how long has it been since you shit in a bucket? 
[01:26:00]  Since I shit in a spackle bucket.  Wow, that's probably 11 years.  Does it turn your stomach now?  Since I've shit in a spackle bucket.  There are times when I've got to take a dump where I wish I had a spackle bucket around.  Yeah, that's what you had to do.  You know, you'd go down into the basement, we'd be on these track jobs where they're  building 800 of the same house, so it would get pretty boring.  You'd get it down to the point where you could finish a whole house in a couple of hours installing  the ductwork in there. 
[01:26:30]  And you'd be on the job, you've got to take a dump, and there's no fucking portable toilet,  it's such a mess.  You just grab a spackle bucket, go down into the basement of one of these places, find a  corner to lean in.  And everybody upstairs is yelling down at you.  Shit in the spackle bucket.  And that's why you never opened a closed spackle bucket.  If you needed a spackle bucket, you could carry your tools in or grab some water for some  concrete mix or whatever the hell you need it for.  You would never grab one that's capped, because you know if you open it up, what you're going 
[01:27:00]  to see in there.  But at least we did that.  The animal Portuguese cement workers would just shit in bathtubs, like people install  a bathtub, and you'd walk into the bathroom, and there's just shit in the bathtub.  Or if the toilet was installed, but the water hasn't been hooked up yet, there's just dried  shit in the bottom of the toilet.  People would just shit and piss everywhere.  If you buy a new house, it has been shit and pissed in every corner of the house.  Yeah, that ground floor. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  It's horrible.  You know what?  I don't think I needed to know that.  I didn't know about that aspect.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Best job I ever had.  I worked at a lumberyard with a bunch of derelicts when I was like 18.  These guys would come in all banged up from the night before.  One guy, basically, he made a fort out of the plywood shelf where he could sleep all day.  And then the boss would go around and find him.  He had a suite set up with a sleeping bag and a pillow and shit like that. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  There were definitely sleeping days, man.  The other thing that was funny, too, was the nail gun fights where you just start shooting  each other with nail guns.  You find your weapon of choice.  We'd have these staplers that we'd just have fights with.  You're absolutely right.  Duct tape was the magic band-aid.  It didn't matter what it was.  Yeah, you deal with it when you're done.  Yep.  All right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Wade in Toronto again. 
[01:28:30]  Wade.  Morning, boys.  What's up, Wade?  Hey, Wade.  I was just thinking, Opie.  You think manual labor is the president of Mexico, eh?  Yeah.  That's a funny joke in Canada.  Oh, that was it?  Okay.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Mississippi.  What up, Jeff?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  We're just, uh, I'm doing construction down here trying to clean up after Katrina, and  one of our favorite things to do to new guys is when they're up on an eight-foot ladder, 
[01:29:00]  we run a finish nailer through the sole of their shoes, nail them to the ladder.  We did that to a new guy last week, and when he was trying to take off boots, he lost his  balance.  He fell ass first into a big mud bucket.  And he got stuck there.  He's a little Guatemala guy.  He just got his ass stuck in there, and that was it.  We watched him roll around like a turtle for about ten minutes.  That's right it, boys.  That's right now.  That's a good story. 
[01:29:30]  There was this short little guy on the job, and a couple of the guys that I worked with  picked him up.  They used to just tease him all the time, because he was like almost midget size, but he was  just above midget.  They lifted him up about two feet, put him against a post, and just duct taped his ankles  to the post.  So he's standing there, and like, whoa, trying to keep from just toppling over one way or  the other, because they duct taped his hands in front of him, and his feet, two feet off 
[01:30:00]  the ground.  It just left him there laughing at him, throw like shit at him.  That's great.  It's like prison.  It's like prison.  There's a hierarchy.  There's gags.  There's people getting shanked.  All right, we'll continue with this subject in a little bit, but we've got to take a  little break, huh?  All righty, take a leak.  Whoa, whoa. 
[01:30:30]  Whip them out.  Tip come out.  Come on, come on, come on.  Come on, lady.  Now, come on, lady.  Come on and open your blouse.  Open your blouse.  Flash your boobies, that girl.  Blast your boobies at girls  Show your melons to guys  Show your melons to guys  If you're not hanged below the dashboard  Below the dashboard  We'll lift those babies up high  Lift those babies up high  Wow 
[01:31:00]  Wow  Wow  Wow  Take them out baby now  Take them out baby  And flap them around  Flap them around  Come on come on come on come on lady now  Come on lady  Go past what wow is about  What wow is about  You've got to lose that shirt  Lose that shirt  And let those fun back bounce  Fun back bounce 
[01:31:30]  Be those small firm or saggy  Firm or saggy  Just let those jugs come out  Let those jugs come out  Wow  Wow  Wow  Wow  Wow  XM202  XM202  There's too many men, too many people, making too many problems, and there's not much love to go around, can't you see this is a land of confusion, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, this is the world we live in, and these are the hands of heaven, why didn't we think of that? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, let's go ahead, try it, because this could be something good for you.  This is the chick we had on this morning, she's now on Clocks and Friends, and she's about to do the weather. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  They found an angle for this girl.  Philly's not on the map.  Philly's not even on there.  Thank you.  D.C.  Yeah.  Over there.  68 degrees, down in Charleston, oh, where'd it go?  It's gone, it's still there.  We have no idea.  56.  Okay, go ahead.  Okay, St. Louis.  Yeah.  49.  Okay.  Let's see, San Antonio, 62.  Yeah.  And up here in Rapid City, 27.  That's true.  She's a natural. 
[01:33:00]  How about the West Coast, Lauren?  Okay.  Stand back.  Okay.  San Diego, looks like 77.  Uh-huh.  Good.  Up here in Sacramento, 76.  Up in Portland, 54.  And Colorado Springs, 24.  Ladies and gentlemen, around the floor.  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Wow.  Are they doing a better job with Lauren, Miss FHM 2005?  Well, the viewers are able to see her.  And you are from New Jersey.  So, right there, they're doing a better job.  And FHM Magazine had a nationwide search for the cover girl or the magazine mascot? 
[01:33:30]  For Miss 2005 FHM.  He doesn't even know what she is.  Thank you.  When did you find out you were there?  At least we did our research.  That's great energy.  Congratulations.  I'd love to stick it in your ass.  It's amazing.  I'm still kind of in shock.  I don't believe it myself until I actually see the magazine.  Oh, that was a problem.  She was in shock.  Which comes out in December.  I should have just wrapped her in a blanket and kept her still.  It's right here.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, there you go.  So, how fast did Playboy call and say, we want you to take your clothes off? 
[01:34:00]  Hey, we asked that.  Hard question.  Would you?  Would you?  No, I don't think I would ever do Playboy.  Good girl.  What is your voicemail?  Let's see if they left a message.  I'm just curious.  Now, Lauren, you think you right now are single, right?  You're living at home.  Don't you feel as though now it's going to be...  Brian, you are not.  I know.  Okay, so I know where this is going.  I'm thinking about our audience.  We're now in Norway and Sweden and Denmark for the Danes.  It's going to be harder to get a date if I'm thinking like you because people are going 
[01:34:30]  to be intimidated.  I can't ask out Ms. FHM.  I'm still the same old person now.  Of course.  They have pixelated out her butt, but she's wearing like panties.  Full panties.  She's got full panties on.  They're showing her laying down.  You barely see anything, but they've pixelated the back of her panties.  They're really, really supportive.  They're excited.  People are so scared shitless of the FCC.  Yeah, he's not really...  Because it's his job to take care of that.  Well, there you go. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  Same interview that we did.  They're not going to get anything out of it.  Everybody's excited.  Everybody's happy.  Yes.  So why don't you guys get some feedback, Fox and Friends.  They're doing a horrendous job, too.  Yawn.  What do you want to do in the long term?  After Ms. FHM, and that's enough for anybody's lifestyle.  Sure.  Do you want to be an actress, a singer, a dancer?  You took a long time.  I do all those things.  And none of them.  No.  I've always been interested in modeling and acting, so hopefully this will open up a couple doors  for me down the road.  But this is just wonderful.  Well, your obligations now. 
[01:35:30]  What do we say?  We asked her that.  She has to make a marriage.  Bastards.  We did the exact same interview.  We say.  Their interview's better because they got some really hot pictures of her that you can look  at as she's given the boring answer.  Yeah.  She's got diner's cloth.  She's got a Sears card.  I have Greta-like questions, and you're jealous.  All right.  Lauren Harris, Ms. FHM 2005.  The magazine comes out very shortly.  And they went with...  How easy...  I mean, I guess she's got to starve herself, so she stays in shape. 
[01:36:00]  But I mean, you just show up and smile.  I'm hot.  You don't have to know anything.  Or have any controversy.  Wow.  They went with the short interview, too.  That was quick.  Say we did short, they did short.  They bailed.  Say we're not the only ones.  All right.  Getting back to the celebrity thing, the GPS, Anthony.  Was that where we were?  Oh, my God.  We went off on an hour tangent.  But, yes, talking about celebrities today.  And this GPS, another idea that a bunch of guys sitting around came up with.  I don't know.  I don't know if this one's going to take off. 
[01:36:30]  Put some celebrity voices.  It's kind of like in that same genre as, I don't know, buying a star for your loved one.  Or having a celebrity wish you a happy birthday.  Who's the brilliant guy that came up with that star thing?  How do you even get the right star?  By a star in your name.  Right.  And it's going to be named in the National Astronomy Registry.  And it will be your name.  Which one is it?  Is it that one right up there?  No, no. 
[01:37:00]  Two more to the left.  Oh!  You won't get popular stars that you could actually see.  Yeah.  It's ones that are so far away, only like the Hubble can see them.  They have to run out of stars, right?  And all it takes is one fire.  And that document's going to be burned out.  The registry is gone.  And we'll just sell them again.  Is there any proof?  I want to talk to people that bought a star.  Can you claim it?  What do you get?  If some miraculous thing happened where tomorrow, travel to other places, other stars, it's instantaneous. 
[01:37:30]  Would it still be legally yours?  Scientists are looking up into the sky and they're actually somewhere formulating the Big Bang Theory.  And they're actually naming, like, saying your name with that star.  It's not happening.  I don't know.  The Beth Jenkins is looking like it's going into the white dwarf phase.  But the Bradley Smith is still a red giant.  What?  Travis, you got a star named after you?  No, my ex-girlfriend bought me a star for Valentine's Day, like, two years ago. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, that's adorable.  You get this huge, huge, like, certificate that says where it is and it gives you your  In the sky.  Can I see, can you recreate the phony, excited look that you had on your face?  Like, oh, honey, you should know.  Oh, baby.  And, you know, you can go online and try and find where your star is.  Try.  Is it visible to the naked eye?  Probably not.  I have no idea.  You didn't check?  No, I really cared.  So what was going through your head when you were given this gift? 
[01:38:30]  So it was very sweet.  We have a star now.  Oh, my God.  It was their star.  This is our star.  Did you take out an acoustic guitar after that and play the song you wrote for her?  Twinkle, twinkle, our star.  Oh, that's adorable.  Travis has a star.  So the Travis star.  You haven't found it yet, though.  No.  Maybe it doesn't exist.  The Travis Connor star. 
[01:39:00]  And how do you find it?  This is the dawning.  The age of Travis.  Age of Travis.  Yeah, I think they can do that.  When the moon is in the seventh house, and Jupiter aligns with Travis.  That's what they do when you get the star.  Some out-of-work musical actors. 
[01:39:30]  Act that out on your front porch.  Fantastic.  I can bring it in.  Yeah, let's go over that and try to find it.  All right.  A lot of people are, oh, this guy bought a star, too.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, you bought a star, huh?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  I bought a star from my parents for Valentine's Day a bunch of years ago.  Oh, great.  Fucking awful.  Now you're ranking on me, and I feel like you're such an idiot for doing it.  Because I saw this on TV.  I'm like, who would buy one of these things? 
[01:40:00]  How did you get the rights for it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  They send you, like, a parchment of, like, ownership of the stars.  I look like this big, giant parchment, you know?  Parchment.  You have to find it.  Like, hear ye, hear ye.  You unroll some parchment.  I want to start a new company where you buy midgets.  You can't buy a midget.  Why?  Because they're people, regardless of what a lot of people think.  You put a GPS system in them, so then you can track your midget on the internet.  Like, hey, I bought that midget, and he's...  Like his game. 
[01:40:30]  His little video game.  Right.  Right now, I got my little so-and-so's running around the computer.  Yeah.  Only it's a real midget.  Well, did your dad like the star thing, Jeff?  No.  He just kind of looked at it and walked away.  It was all about my mom.  Of course, a dad is going to be like, great.  Ah, he's a bum.  Still framed it on the wall, though, boys.  Name a star for any occasion.  Custom, deluxe, and ultimate package.  Beautiful 16x12 full-color parchment certificate personalized with the star's name, date, and 
[01:41:00]  coordinates.  There's still stars left?  Apparently so.  Deluxe is a 20x16 package.  Package includes complimentary personalized wallet card imprinted with the star name and  coordinates, so you can have it in your wallet, so you can just pull that out.  See, if Travis had that, he could have just shown us right there his little wallet card.  Yeah.  Along with the International Star Registry parchment up on his wall. 
[01:41:30]  You know, we're provoking aliens by doing this.  You don't think they're already listening in?  Are that son of a bitch renaming our star?  Yeah.  You think somewhere...  This is how it starts, man.  Right.  They're claiming our star.  You think there's some aliens somewhere else, like, and they've already sold us off?  Like, our son is, you know, like, fucking...  Right.  That's our son's name.  I'm an alien with a name you can't pronounce.  Owens. 
[01:42:00]  This fine rock that we're rolling on.  All right, let's say...  And Bush goes on TV.  These guys, they've been renaming our son.  Renaming our son.  We can't allow that to happen, because next thing they're going to try to take is our freedom.  All right, here we go.  Bat Wing Ball Bag.  That's a great name.  Hello, Loppy.  Hi, guys.  That's a great name, by the way.  I like that one.  Well, hey, you gave it to me.  Thank you very much.  Very nice.  All right.  What do you got?  Hey, you actually don't own the star.  No?  What?  You actually just own a copyright.  It's like a book. 
[01:42:30]  Somebody's putting this in a book, and you own the copyright.  Huh?  Yeah.  What?  The name of it actually is written in a book, and it's the copyright.  The copyright to it.  Is it the copyright?  You know what?  You know what?  They can't even commit to this.  This is what you do.  Obviously, space travel isn't going to advance to the point where you're going to be able  to visit your star.  So, you sell these stars to the average Joe and say, you actually own this star for the  length of your life.  No.  And then at that point, it goes back to God's territory or whatever. 
[01:43:00]  Well, here is an astronomer, Loppy.  This is an astronomer, Peter Ensern.  He's in Australia.  I don't know what his name is.  But he answers questions here.  Can I buy or name a star?  No, is the answer to that.  But I have heard there were organizations that will do this.  Isn't it true?  Answer.  There are organizations that will take your money and send you a certificate.  But these documents have no validity and are not recognized by anyone else. 
[01:43:30]  There are at least a half dozen companies or individuals who claim the ability to name  stars.  However, no private company has ever been granted the authority to name stars by any government,  professional, astronomical organization, or international treaty.  Fuck that.  So it's all bullshit.  How about we just all start owning stars on our own?  Who's telling us that we can and can't do this?  If the company says these stars are officially registered or copyrighted, doesn't that make  them legitimate or official?  America?  With the Library of Congress or the U.S. Patent Office. 
[01:44:00]  Official registered can simply mean registered with the star naming company.  That does not mean anyone outside the company will accept this list of stars or their names  as valid.  Let's say the astronomers in Japan.  Are they accepting what we have decided here in the United States?  No.  There could be five different companies, let's say, that each sell the same star with a different  name.  Like, your star could be Travis's star if two different companies have sold the same star. 
[01:44:30]  I don't want a fucking star.  You have one now.  What's a great scam?  I've given you one by proxy, just using this as an example.  You've got to appreciate a good scam, though.  It is a good scam.  Selling stars.  Stop it.  Look at this guy or girl.  Cody, the guy.  Cody, Minnesota?  Hey.  What's up?  You bought a fucking star, it says.  Yep.  It's a piece of shit.  It's called the International Star Registry.  Right.  That's the big one.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Basically, they only sell it to you if you're in Minnesota.  Not in Minnesota.  In the United States. 
[01:45:00]  Who did you buy it for?  My ex-girlfriend's fucking cunt.  Your ex-girlfriend.  Yeah.  $250, yeah.  $200.  I'd like it back.  And what did she say when you gave it to her?  Usual bullshit.  Oh, it's so cute.  Oh, God.  Shut up and suck my cunt.  This is so sweet.  Let's go outside and look for it. 
[01:45:30]  Where is it?  Oh.  You don't even know.  You're like, right up.  Do you see right up there?  That one.  Just point it like something real bright, like Venus.  Right.  That's yours, baby.  It's the brightest one in the sky.  Isn't that the North Star?  No.  No, no.  That's your star.  That's your star.  I paid an extra $250 for it.  Yeah.  I got that whole pattern there that looks like a spoon.  That's yours now.  What a crock of shit.  Who's falling for this?  They call it the Big Rebecca now. 
[01:46:00]  Cody.  Cody.  What's up?  Why?  Why did you fall for this?  Last minute.  Pussy Whip?  I've seen these commercials on TV.  I'm like, no one's buying into this, are they?  Registered with the star registry.  I bought into it.  I'm a retard.  Yeah.  All right.  That's stupid.  Is it true you could also own pieces of the moon?  That's what Kirby's saying in Oklahoma.  That's ridiculous.  Hey, guys.  I got a friend of mine who bought for his wife an acre of land on the moon. 
[01:46:30]  Come on.  He is fucking convinced that one day it's going to be worth a million to be held onto it when  we move up there.  Yeah.  In his great, great, great, great grandson's life.  Yeah.  When we all move to the moon.  Yeah.  That won't happen until the year 1990.  When we establish moon bases.  What happened?  You know, we do have to find some of those old clips.  Yeah.  Is there a way to do that?  I love the old 50s movies when it's supposed to be the future, but obviously the movies 
[01:47:00]  were made in the 50s.  Right.  And they go through decade by decade.  By 1970, we had established bases on Mars and Venus.  By 1990, we had left the solar system.  And then you're watching and going, God, we really were aiming high, weren't we?  All right.  This is going to be our new bit.  I don't know how we're going to make this happen.  It's like your New Year's resolutions you make every year.  I'm going to drop 20 pounds.  Yeah.  It doesn't work.  I'm going to get a six pack.  That's how they read some classics.  And you really thought it was going to read some classics. 
[01:47:30]  You thought it was going to go that way.  Yeah.  I absolutely thought growing up that by 1990, by the year 2000, by much, I'll read for whom  the bells toll.  You thought it was going to be something going on.  Why don't we try to figure this out, though?  Eric, do you think you could do it?  Or maybe we'd get the listeners involved?  Yeah.  Get those old movies and those old news clips where they're telling us what's going to  happen in the future.  Star Trek has a few.  I know Star Trek has, like, by 1980, your third world war that happened in 1975.  It would be very interesting to get some of these clips from the old movies and the old 
[01:48:00]  news programs and stuff and see how accurate they actually were.  Mm-hmm.  There's some comic used to do, I don't even know who it was, but used to do a funny bit  about Star Trek, which is kind of a hacky comic subject.  But there's always the three-person rule in Star Trek, two of which had to be Earthlings,  and then they had to have the alien guy.  So it's like, you know, you're Julius Caesar, you're Abraham Lincoln, and Vulcan's Amaco  Choco Hose. 
[01:48:30]  You know, he has to throw that alien guy in from Rigel 7.  Uh, Star Trek is completely fake.  Yeah, stop.  This is how Indians lost America.  That's why we're selling off land.  Can we, uh, oh, this guy has a very good question in Virginia.  Uh-huh.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Uh, Ant, uh, you'd be the expert on this, but, uh, do you think you could buy a black  hole and name it Robin?  Pooh.  Pooh.  Pooh.  Uh, Fred, uh, got me a black hole and ended up Robin. 
[01:49:00]  Pooh.  Pooh.  Pooh.  Pooh.  Now she's in a dunking booth doing the news.  Ugh.  They ripped me off.  Uh.  It's my start.  Pooh.  Pooh.  Pooh.  All right, we'll do one more of these, and then we've got to get to the celebrity thing,  because now there's a new thing.  Look at us.  Because we were talking about how celebrities could call you on your birthday, well, now they're  doing it with the GPS, right?  Birthday.  Let's say hi to Corey in Georgia.  Hey.  That would be your cue, Corey.  You're on.  Corey.  Corey.  Georgia.  Maury.  Wife, Maury. 
[01:49:30]  Maury a star.  You're from Georgia?  Yeah, you.  What's your name?  Corey.  What?  Corey.  That's who we were saying.  What were you listening to, my friend?  I was listening to you.  I just couldn't get through.  I was saying, hello?  Hello?  Your pants are on fire.  I just got done taking a great big Howard down here in Georgia.  Big Howard in the toilet.  We get it.  He says it twice.  We get it, dude.  We're trying to help you, man.  Did you buy your wife a star, sir?  No, my wife bought me a star. 
[01:50:00]  It was also the best blowjob I got that night, man.  I said, baby, you're the only star I need.  Ugh.  The best.  Oh, she just went to knock.  Wow.  Damn.  Holy shit.  Don't do that while I'm driving.  I'll have a real crash.  Still not impressed with the phone calls we get from Georgia, I got to tell you.  What's that?  I'm not impressed with the calls we get from Georgia.  Georgia, usually, yeah.  A little shaky.  Really bad calls.  A little shaky.  I don't think they understand the program yet. 
[01:50:30]  Anthony, so now we got celebrities doing the GPS thing, and we found a Mr. T one.  Yeah, there's a couple over there.  Mr. T.  Now, this is what you need.  A normal GPS has a generic female voice.  She's really hot sounding.  It's just, you know, left turn.  Next left.  Continue on this highway, you know, and then it's not distracting.  It's nice, pleasant.  That's it.  Subtly aroused.  Yes. 
[01:51:00]  The last thing you need is Mr. T yelling at you when you're driving.  Because everyone's a little on edge when they're driving.  Especially if you're driving somewhere new where you need a navigation system.  It's obviously somewhere you haven't been before.  That's why they were smart when they invented the GPS to get a very soft voice.  Yes.  To help you along on your commute.  Next left.  Right.  Very soft.  Like that.  You're still losing your mind, though.  Fuck you.  Fuck.  Make a mistake and it has you turning around.  Do you ever start talking back to her like, I know. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  The miles thing is always off, too.  They'll be like, make a left in .03 miles.  And so now you're looking at your odometer.  You're not missing the turn.  It's always like at least three quarters of a mile.  My God, I've gone three tenths of a mile.  Maybe in the old GPS.  What are you looking at your odometer?  I'm looking at the one on the . . .  On the GPS?  No, whatever.  Budget rent a car.  I don't have a car.  Oof.  Budget.  What was it, like stuck to the dashboard with a . . .  Sticky?  They're on my . . . 
[01:52:00]  Excuse me, guys.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Excuse me.  Sorry, we don't all have a fucking Escalade just tearing into the atmosphere.  Breaking news.  Excuse me.  Breaking news.  Howard has admitted he has invented something else today.  Caveman, New Jersey.  What's happening, shit dicks?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Fucking Howard just claimed that he invented MTV's Unplugged.  I swear to God.  No, you're joking.  Now it's a joke and you're just kidding, right?  Dude, I swear to Christ. 
[01:52:30]  We like to break into the show when we find out the latest thing Howard has invented.  And today it's Howard has invented or invented MTV Unplugged.  How is he pulling this one off there, Caveman?  He is the George Washington Carver of everything.  Huh?  Well, he said what he did was he had a group come on his show with an acoustic guitar.  And then a week later MTV did it.  And then every radio station did it.  He did not say this.  No.  He did not.  He invented. 
[01:53:00]  At this point, he's a joke.  He stinks.  He's a joke of his former self.  Look, whether you...  I can't even keep track of all the inventions.  Whether you like them or not, it's beyond that.  Was it last week he said that he invented best ofs?  Best ofs.  Any type of best of that you hear.  Even though television had been calling it reruns for years.  Right.  Best of...  Well, whatever.  He invented jaywalking.  He invented that.  That Jay does.  Right.  I'm trying to remember all the ones. 
[01:53:30]  Dude, you'll not...  Wow, Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  He invented WoW.  Invented that.  He invented the Osbournes.  He invented the Osbournes.  That was a big one.  The Osbournes.  Reality television he invented.  He invented reality...  Reality television.  Reality television.  Reading.  Syndication.  Reality TV.  Syndication.  MTV Unplugged.  Got to get all these down.  Polio vaccine.  Polio vaccine.  What else? 
[01:54:00]  That was Jonas Stern.  Oh, he invented breathing.  That's right.  Forgot about that.  Breathing.  Breathing.  Walking upright.  Walking upright.  Tell him, Fred.  What else, Anthony?  Walking upright.  There were so many.  Porn.  He invented porn?  Yeah, why not?  He invented everything else.  I doubt it.  He did not say he invented MTV Unplugged.  MTV Unplugged.  Acoustic acts.  What did they do before electric guitars? 
[01:54:30]  Everything was acoustic.  Everything was on Dylan in a fucking little club in the village.  Was Dylan Unplugged.  Right.  Dylan was the one that decided, you know what, I'm going to plug in.  Yeah.  You idiot.  Oh, my God.  Enough already.  Let's say hi to Josh in D.C.  Josh.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Josh.  Happy birthday, Bill Burr.  He's now justifying the fact that he had Unplugged first by playing all these acoustic songs. 
[01:55:00]  All these acts that have come on the show already.  Oh, my God.  People.  He feels the need that he has to prove himself to all the listeners to prove that he's, you know,  the man that invented everything.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Do you guys call him up when he starts down this road?  Yeah, doesn't anyone call him out on this shit and say, look, Howard, you're full of shit.  You're delusional.  You're losing your fucking mind.  I think he busies out his life because you can't get through.  You can't be the...  Our listeners get through all the time and drive him nuts.  Every time he claims he invents something, you try to dial in and it's just busy, busy, busy. 
[01:55:30]  Well, this guy makes a great point.  Fred from Jersey.  Howard actually copied Best of Carson.  Carson's reruns used to be called that way back.  Remember when Johnny would take a day off and there wasn't a guest host?  It would be the Best of Carson.  And it was clips of the best parts of his show.  Trying to claim that he invented Best of's is just ridiculous.  Ooh.  Ridiculous.  It was reruns.  Never occurred.  Wow.  All right.  Well, keep us informed.  We like to keep a list of all the things Howard invented, supposedly. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, one more thing.  Rich in Georgia.  Go ahead.  Hey, trying to vindicate Georgia here, man, but you guys forgot a real important one.  Yeah.  He invented calling in shows.  He invented what?  Calling in shows, man.  He's been calling them in for years.  I'm actually from New York.  He means phoning it in.  Yeah, phoning it in.  Well, thank you, Georgia.  Punch it out.  Oh, that's right.  He also claimed that he invented...  Go ahead, Chris.  I'll let you say it.  Chris from PA. 
[01:56:30]  Everyone hates Chris show, that Chris Rock show.  No, he says that that was his idea, because Howard started in the high school years.  Yeah, that's right.  He says that they stole that idea from him also.  That's right.  Holy shit.  Stop it.  I thought they stole it from the Wonder Years and Everybody Loves Raymond.  Yeah.  Isn't it the Wonder Years?  Now he's claiming Chris Rock stole his life.  Stole his idea.  And now he says he's got his ideas on the air.  People don't have time to listen to Howard.  Howard is so paranoid.  He thinks all these creative people are sitting back listening to Howard every morning so they  could get their next idea. 
[01:57:00]  People don't have time.  And Chris stole his childhood.  Yeah.  If it wasn't for him, it wouldn't be a world, it seems like.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I forgot about that one.  I've got to add that to the list.  The new Chris Rock show he invented.  New Chris Rock show.  I am stunned.  All right.  So, getting back to this.  Oh, you got the audio?  Yeah, let's listen in on this.  Bands never, ever took an acoustic guitar, brought it in, and played on the radio. 
[01:57:30]  Led Zeppelin 3.  And we started doing it all the way back to NBC days.  Could you stop this?  DC 101.  DC 101.  I have at home Zeppelin playing on radio on the BBC.  Dude.  Stop.  Back, Alan Freed would have people come in and go, do up, do up, do up, do up, do up.  And the only reason these big acts would come in, especially in the early days, you know,  and play acoustically is because they couldn't get all that equipment into a radio station. 
[01:58:00]  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  He's losing his fucking mind.  He's really going crazy, and I don't want to start feeling sorry for him.  It's getting close.  It's getting very close.  It's getting close.  When I start feeling bad for somebody, wow, he's losing his fucking mind.  Let's listen a little more, and we'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  Go ahead.  To NBC days.  DC 101.  And DC 101 as well.  And all of a sudden, you saw a burst of sudden genius, like on MTV. 
[01:58:30]  They started having artists in to do it, and then all the other radio stations started doing it.  Today it is...  MTV built a whole series.  Shut up, you fucking hole!  It's so commonplace now to hear a guy come in with a guitar and play a stripped-down acoustic version.  I'm telling you the truth.  When I was on in Washington, D.C., it was never heard of.  And I remember I used to receive such accolades because it occurred to me that people could come in with just a guitar.  He's officially a crazy old fuck. 
[01:59:00]  He is a crazy bastard.  How do you go on and claim this?  How do you claim that?  It's like buying a star.  It's just like buying a star.  I have a certificate of authenticity on Unplugged Acts, Robin.  Tell him, Fred.  I invented buying stars.  Back in...  From the NBC days.  DC 101.  DC 101 days.  Back when I was in Roosevelt.  Woo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Fred ain't saying shit. 
[01:59:30]  He even knows your delusions.  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  Well, he's losing his mind.  All right.  He understands.  Invented Unplugged now.  There is a lot of pressure.  I can't keep up with all his inventions.  With him going over to satellite, a lot of pressure.  Howard Einstein.  There's going to be a huge decrease in his audience size, and he's a little freaked out about it.  And he's...  Right now, this is a man trying to justify his career.  He's trying to justify his life and his career and give it some validation in his waning days. 
[02:00:00]  That's what he's doing.  And now, he's claiming ownership of MTV Unplugged and any Unplugged.  Well, good luck, Howie.  Don't make his luck over there.  Let's find examples of other performers playing Unplugged before you got into radio.  I mean, this one's way too easy.  All of the radio rips me off. 
[02:00:30]  Of course.  Of course, Howie.  Of course.  All right, Anthony.  The GPS and the celebrities.  Mm-hmm.  So, instead of the hot voice...  No one was thinking about celebrities doing GPS, Robin.  Until me.  I was actually in someone's car giving them directions.  I said, turn right here.  And somebody said, that's a great idea.  Could you just be in my car all the time and talk and give me directions?  I said, I'll tape it for you.  A lot of people are very pissed off at me right now, and I don't blame them, but I get a little excited. 
[02:01:00]  Uh, Plastic Man from Columbus, Ohio says it all.  Thanks a lot, Opie.  I just lost my fucking hearing.  I just lose my mind when Robin talks on that show, because she has absolutely nothing to add whatsoever.  You have to do your yelling way back here.  Yeah, I know.  You have to go like this and yeah.  I know.  I know.  Yeah, that'll work.  But she drives me nuts, because she has nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  She's the luckiest lady in broadcasting. 
[02:01:30]  And she should just shut up.  How many times does Scotzo have people on?  Well, you know what?  And play acoustically.  Why don't we get Black Earl on the phone?  Black Earl will know.  Maybe we'll bore the shit out of people with this, but we were lucky enough to work for a radio station called WNEW.  WNEW, one of the first rock stations in America, they had an archive.  Remember the archive?  It was a vault.  It was like a museum.  Remember, the temperature had to be just right in there. 
[02:02:00]  It was a vault.  There were tapes, reel-to-reel tapes in there.  Reel-to-reel tapes going back to the 70s.  Yep.  Of bands performing for WNEW.  Yeah, acoustically and plugged in.  And guess what?  There wasn't just a few.  No.  There were thousands of these.  There was a library.  At this point, they're trying to figure out what to do with all these tapes because it's just a gold mine.  They don't know what to do with these tapes.  It's in this weird room at WNEW.  It's like a vault.  It's like a bank vault.  There's only like one or two keys.  The temperature has to be just perfect in there. 
[02:02:30]  Earl.  Yo.  At WNEW, right?  Yeah.  That room that has all the archives of the bands coming in?  Yeah.  How many reel-to-reel tapes would you say are in that room?  Thousands.  Thousands.  Okay.  Thousands.  And how far back does it go?  I think as far back as 71, maybe?  71.  1971.  And is it true, Earl, that these bands would perform for WNEW? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, all the time.  It was everywhere.  Would they perform electrically?  It would be...  It depended.  The tech setup usually was acoustic.  It was easier to set up.  There you go.  And Scotzo would talk with the artists, John Lennon and such, members of the Who, and maybe  they would perform acoustically in the studio.  Yeah.  They would play songs live in the studio.  No, just a simple setup.  Wasn't there something called the WNEW Magic Ballroom or whatever it was called? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  The Imaginary Ballroom?  The Imaginary Ballroom.  What happened during the WNEW Imaginary Ballroom?  The bands would play a lot.  And this would be what year, Earl?  Wow.  I mean, it's old as radio itself, practically.  Let's just...  Is it fair to say before 1980?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  See, we back up our shit with fair to say around the times of Bob Hope. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, and if you go back to WNEW AM...  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we're just gonna...  In the older days...  Well, we'll be fair.  We know for a fact from, say, 1971 to at least 1980...  Yeah.  There were a lot of bands coming through WNEW playing live.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Well, you also gotta remember in the days of AM, band...  That was how the radio shows were done.  The bands would play in the studio.  Yeah, they would come in the studio and play live. 
[02:04:30]  That's how it was done.  There's a bunch of frauds that work around Howard, too.  They're all too scared to, like, bring it to a shit.  Yeah, Howard.  Yeah.  Shit.  What does he say now?  They all just sit there and kiss his ass and lick his asshole.  Earl, he just said, just moments ago, that he invented MTV Unplugged.  Because before him, no one was playing acoustically on his show.  Yeah, no one had an artist come on a radio show with an acoustic guitar and just play and 
[02:05:00]  sing on the radio like that.  And after he did it, MTV ripped that off and started the MTV Unplugged.  Like 80% of Led Zeppelin's third album was acoustic.  Acoustic.  Now he's just talking crazy.  He is.  Well, we know that.  He has lost his name.  That's why we like to back it up with facts.  Yeah, but the acoustic...  Do you have an example of some of the artists that played on WNEW?  Um, you know, uh, Greg Lake, uh...  Greg Lake from ELP. 
[02:05:30]  Greg Lake from ELP.  Uh-huh.  Patty Smith.  Uh-huh.  Uh, Roger Daltrey.  Yeah.  Wait, Roger Daltrey actually played live at WNEW?  Yeah, he played...  They did an acoustic setup in the studio.  That's great.  Hey, can I play that clip again of Howard?  Because we do back up our shit.  Yeah, listen to this, Earl.  Um, bands never, ever took an acoustic guitar, brought it in...  Never, ever.  ...and played on the radio. 
[02:06:00]  And, uh, we started doing it all the way back to NBC days.  DC 101.  And DC 101 as well.  Oh, that was Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  And all of a sudden you saw a burst of sudden genius, like on MTV, they started having artists  in to do it, and then all the other radio stations started doing it.  Today it is...  MTV built a whole series on plugs around it.  Yep, it is so commonplace now to hear a guy come in with a guitar and play a stripped  down acoustic version.  I'm telling you the truth.  When I was on in Washington, D.C., it was never heard of. 
[02:06:30]  And I remember I used to receive such accolades because it occurred to me that people could  come in with just a guitar.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  He just lies openly to his listeners.  And the people sitting around him know it's not true, but they're pussies.  A bunch of fucking pussies.  Wow.  And that hole, what does she add there?  Nothing.  Nothing!  Again!  And guys, other stations, other FM rock stations were doing this across the country as well. 
[02:07:00]  I mean, K-Rock LA must have tons of tapes.  Yeah, but K-Rock LA, we're being fair since Howard started broadcasting.  Yeah.  K-Rock LA was after Howard started broadcasting, right?  Uh, probably, yeah.  So, I mean, we have a good example, WNAW.  We all worked there.  We saw the vault.  It's sick how unbelievable this thing is.  They got all sorts of very, very rare recordings.  They should do something with that.  They still don't know what to do.  They should just hand it over to a record company and let them figure it out.  And all these bands were coming through, WNAW, and playing acoustically, including Roger Daltrey. 
[02:07:30]  I mean...  Yeah, hey guys, remember the BBC sessions, too, going back to at least 1960.  If Memory Serves didn't let Zeppelin release an entire album of stuff they did live on the BBC.  I got that.  Fucking incredible.  I got that.  And then we got Ben in the studio.  WBCN was doing the exact same thing back in the day.  They had Aerosmith doing that stuff in, like, 1973 when their first album came out.  73, Aerosmith, BCN, Acoustic. 
[02:08:00]  Bruce Springsteen at BCN when they were on the top of the crew and Born to Run was out, like, 1975.  I mean, BCN was always back from...  They started in 68, like, N-E-W.  No, no.  No one...  You heard him.  No one ever, no one ever, never took an acoustic guitar.  Ever.  Ever.  He's the biggest fraud in radio, and people have to start figuring that out and realizing  that.  They just kept making acoustic instruments for some reason, but no one was using them.  Another one, Boston's, 1976, their first album came out. 
[02:08:30]  They did a thing with BCN when I remember that, with, like, Hitch Your Ride was acoustic back  then.  And BCN has all those old tapes, too.  But he realized that a guy could just come in with an acoustic...  He realized that he could just come in with an acoustic guitar.  Look, he's lost his mind.  He's lost his mind.  All right.  What do you think they have a tambourine for?  Huh?  Well, that's for the drummer when they come in.  Right, right, right.  And shit's going to be too loud.  Earl? 
[02:09:00]  Yes?  Thank you, sir.  You just proved our point, which is making Bloodfart very, very annoyed today.  Bloodfart.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  How are you?  Uh, okay.  I'm actually a huge, absolutely a huge fan of the show.  Yeah, but Bloodfart, you're not being honest, because I know what you're going to say.  You're going to say, why bring Stern up every day?  Do we bring up Stern every day?  Well, for the most part...  Do we bring up Stern every day?  You're preaching the choir, Earl.  I know, but we don't bring...  But you guys exaggerate with your shit, and it's getting annoying.  First of all, it's not every day. 
[02:09:30]  First of all, we don't bring up Stern every day.  And secondly...  The other issue some of the fans on Wackbag had was we're spending too much time talking  about the assault on the media.  That's not true either.  So keep it between the lines.  We don't bring them up every day.  It's not every day.  It's whenever something like this comes up, some bit of hypocrisy that no one seems to  want to point out that this jackass is going on the air and just bullshitting on a daily  basis.  And we want to take the opportunity, when it does happen, to point it out, to show people 
[02:10:00]  that the guy's a fucking fraud.  What's the problem with that?  Yeah, Bloodfart, he's been getting away with murder, and there's a lot at stake here as  he moves to satellite radio.  To who?  Yeah.  To who?  Maybe to the brand new audience on DirecTV that has no clue who we are and was just going  past the channels and went, hmm, who are these guys?  Okay.  Maybe it's not always about you, Bloodfart.  It is all about you, boys.  I love you.  Later.  All right.  Thank you.  He's on the message board?  Attack. 
[02:10:30]  No, no.  Let's hack Bloodfart.  You know what, by the way?  I like some of his posting.  I'm banning him.  No, I like Bloodfart.  I really do.  And I like him.  No, stop.  Next time, he is banned.  All right, good.  That's the way to handle that, I think.  Bill, any problem with what was just done there?  No.  I think you handled that perfectly, okay?  It's just that we have to point this stuff out.  You know, Howard tried to beat us up when we first came to New York.  It never happened.  It never will happen.  And as we move forward, now that we don't work for the same fucking company, where he could 
[02:11:00]  strong-arm us with the big bosses behind the scenes, now this is what we do.  Now we point it out every single day if we have to.  That's how it works.  And if you don't like it, listen to something else.  Elton John released an entire album in 1970 that was recorded from a session on the old  station in New York City with Dave Herman hosting.  It was all acoustic.  In 1956, Buddy Holly went into a radio station throughout the Midwest and performed his songs  on acoustic guitar.  Yeah, there's so many examples.  And if you know anything about, I guess it would be called semantics officially, Howard 
[02:11:30]  is lying so bad that he has to point out that I am telling the truth.  As soon as you have to tell someone you're telling the truth, you don't even feel good  about what you're saying.  I'm telling the truth.  Because he knows...  How come Bill isn't saying shit?  Is he afraid of not having a spot on Howie Show after you guys self-destruct?  Comics never like bad-mouthing anybody with a show.  Yeah, I never got into a battle with him.  Even Jimmy Norton. 
[02:12:00]  That's like when Rogan came in and he trashed...  Mencia.  Carlos.  Yeah, I don't know Carlos.  We understand.  We see you sitting there just like Jimmy Norton did.  We have a lot of anger that built up for many years because of this fucking prick.  He's a fraud.  He's a fraud.  He's been getting away with murder for many, many years, so we will point this out every  chance we get now.  No problem.  Fucking with us behind the scenes in corporate, so screw him.  Jackass really just called me out there.  Certainly did.  Thought I could just sit here and let you guys froth at the mouth.  It's alright.  As I do every other day.  And make sure you call Howard and remind him that he did not invent this. 
[02:12:30]  It'll drive him nuts.  Everyone knows.  It'll drive him nuts again.  David Lee Roth is the future anyway of radio, so...  Of course.  We're all scared of David Lee Roth.  He'll be the next one we're scared of.  Ouch.  Alright, why don't we take a break?  Aren't we going to do something about Mr. T and navigation systems?  Oh no.  Wow, man.  Is he still on hold?  We stink.  We fucking stink.  And we wrap up every Howard Stern rant with his fine reading of the XM Satellite Radio commercial. 
[02:13:00]  Quickly, though, Linda had a great point on there, on line four.  Linda?  Yes.  Hi.  You'd like to bring up another radio live event?  Yeah, actually, this has been pretty enlightening, because I didn't realize, when the Little Rascals were performing live on the radio,  Darla and Alfalfa were actually at DC 101 with Howard.  It was the International Silver String Submarine Band, and I believe they performed live. 
[02:13:30]  That was an acoustic act.  Oh, very good.  Finally, they used, what are those things called?  Kazoos.  Kazoos.  And they did the daring young man on the flying trapeze, and every so often, they would hit a symbol.  And you were in the audience.  Yes.  They would hit a symbol, and my hat would pop off, and my hair flew up in the engineering room.  Exactly.  Who knew?  Who knew Howard was involved with that also?  Yep.  It was way back.  Thank you so much.  All right.  Bye-bye.  We'll go to break with Howard Stern talking, finally, about XM Satellite Radio.

[02:15:00]  I gotta speak up.  We can't go to break.  Oh, and they are just losing their minds in the room.  I have to speak up.  What the fuck was that?  That wasn't just the commercial.  There's music playing over it.  What was that?  That was a submission we got from Chemistry.  Chemistry?  And just off the cuff, off the fly, out of the fucking blue?  You decide to play that one?  I thought it was something different, but...  Holy shit, Hawk.  Oh, well.  Holy shit. 
[02:15:30]  Good call.  You just decide to play some fucking faggot music over something you kind of wanted to hear.  You couldn't hear what Howie was saying.  The music's too loud in the mix.  I don't know what that music is.  Made me want to start having butt sex.  What the fuck?  Why not just play the one?  Excuse me?  It was very gay music is what I was trying to convey there with the butt sex.  It was definitely, but it wasn't enough to convince me to go to the other side.  It was very gay.  I think it's going to take a little more than that. 
[02:16:00]  Jesus.  Hawke, excuse?  No.  All right, delete it right now.  Right in front of us.  Please delete that.  Let me watch you delete it.  Of course.  Wow.  It's frozen.  It's gone.  There you go.  Here's Howard Stern talking about XM Satellite Radio.  This is the one we wanted to play.  Howard Stern loves XM Satellite Radio.  Loves it, loves it, loves it.  He has it in his Escalade, and he loves talking about it.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, 
[02:16:30]  it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop, unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news, sports, talk, and comedy.  All in digital quality sound.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard. 
[02:17:00]  XM.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM is XM Satellite Radio.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  How can I honestly say anybody rips me off?  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what? 
[02:17:30]  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right, well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know you...  I know I...  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay, whatever.  I got to go.  Please, I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that 
[02:18:00]  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  They don't have to grab it.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  The car is all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  It's like, beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude. 
[02:18:30]  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  I've been down.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I've done it all.  I did already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  Killed themselves.  I've done it all.  I was the first one to do anything.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier. 
[02:19:00]  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Ooh, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw, like, something?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car? 
[02:19:30]  Is that what, it wasn't even flat.  Yeah, girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Ooh, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care. 
[02:20:00]  I don't care.  I invented that.  The bandana was me.  Kirby and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  I like this instant feedback from James in Georgia.  Big comeback for Georgia today.  Hey, fellas, just had a thought.  I can now TiVo your show and listen to it whenever the hell I want.  Thank you, DirecTV.  That's right.  That's a great, great feature.  You got a TiVo or does DirecTV have the DVR kind of thing yet? 
[02:20:30]  I don't know.  I'm sure they will in no time.  That's the one problem with the MiFi.  You can't really rewind or fast forward.  Yep.  So like our show, for example, is saved in chunks.  So if we go an hour.  Without a break.  That's one chunk.  And you can't like fast forward or rewind within that chunk.  You know what I mean?  And we've been working on it.  We're trying to figure out something where maybe the display changes throughout the show  so then it's broken into lesser chunks.  Can't you fast forward but it's like you have to go through that whole chunk? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, it goes from chunk to chunk, basically.  Yeah.  Like you record a channel, let's say, on your MiFi.  And when I'm in the car, it's all about Ethel, let's say.  And then all of a sudden I got a bunch of songs on there and I could either skip forward or backwards  depending on what song I want to listen to.  Right.  But you can't fast forward within the song or rewind within the song.  They should invent something.  Yeah.  I think it's on the way.  But the point I'm making with this whole DirecTV thing, now that problem is solved 
[02:21:30]  because you TiVo the show and then you know when we're boring.  You know when that segment is just not going anywhere.  I'm going to fast forward 10 minutes and see if they got better.  See what they did.  See what they do now.  So just love the DirecTV deal.  It's awesome for us.  Absolutely.  All right.  You want to get to the GPS audio?  We were headed there somewhere.  Oh, no.  Scott Perrell.  I got DirecTV. 
[02:22:00]  It rocks.  I got all the games going.  I got porno.  I got you now.  It's ridiculous.  Where are you working these days?  Well, I'm still doing the Fox Sports Radio thing and, you know, I'm having a huge bash  in Miami on 142.  You know, it'll be on all weekend.  I'm going to be going to the last NASCAR race at Homestead and I'm going to crown Tony  Stewart the champion on Sunday.  Saturday, Bush race, I'm hitting the Miami Canes, Georgia Tech football game at the Orange  Bowl with all the Cuban hotties. 
[02:22:30]  Woo!  Hey, we have your pal Bill Burr in studio today.  That's cool, man.  I guess both the Yankees and Red Sox blow, huh?  Yeah, but A-Rod is the MVP.  Yeah, he blows too.  What a pussy.  Oh, you don't like A-Rod?  He's got no rings and he talks a lot.  He stood there and held the bat for five days in October.  It was torture for me.  I was drinking shots of Goose.  Well, I almost had a heart attack watching him lose.  Jesus, it was awful.  I mean, just what the White Sox did to everybody was unbelievable. 
[02:23:00]  They're killing everybody.  Hey, look at the Giants.  All their owners are dying off and then that game last week sucked against the Vikings.  God, I'm just, I'm glad I'm going to South Beach.  I need to look at all those titties down there and get some sun.  Yeah, the Giants looked awful last week.  It always ends with pussy.  Yeah, I know.  Pussy or booze.  And their co-owner died last night, I guess, huh?  Yeah, the Tick family lost their father.  Bob, she was 79, he had brain cancer.  Of course, Mara had passed, I don't know, a month ago. 
[02:23:30]  I mean, it was just a bummer.  I was at that game and it was just torture.  They had a, Sharper had a 90-yard pick for a touchdown, a punt return for a touchdown they  had in the game, a kickoff return for a touchdown.  Manning threw four picks and still tied the game when they went for two late in the game  and then they lose on the field goal.  It was crazy.  The beer ended up giving me a hangover just losing that way.  I've never seen a team lose that.  He wraps it up.  He wraps it up with beer or pussy.  With beer or pussy.  I love it.  It's the only way it's going to go. 
[02:24:00]  You fucking rock, Pharrell.  Honest to God, I'm going to the, I'm hitting, I called all my boys down in Miami, I'm hitting  Scarlet's, the Versace room.  I'm taking down a bunch of raw spenders from New York to just blow money and look at hotties  and get food, put soap, poured all over us naked in a hot strip club on set.  Now we're going to Joe's Stone Crab.  We're going to eat crabs and claws and everything else until we're blue in the face.  We're going to just be busting off rounds.  Anybody that wants to party with us, go to Homestead Speedway on Sunday. 
[02:24:30]  I'm doing shows there Saturday morning, Sunday morning.  They'll both be hangover shows.  Count on it.  And I hope Fez will be right.  What do you think about the Iraqi war?  How's Fez, man?  Is he cool?  Fez, he's all right, man.  Well, send him my love.  And I was really sorry to hear about that.  You guys have it, I have it your way.  You're kicking ass on TV now, too.  I'm digging it.  I got to run and I'll see you freaks in Miami.  You bitches better come and party with me.  Uh, no. 
[02:25:00]  You guys are soft.  All right, Scott.  You guys, that'd be cool.  All right, there you go.  Scott Pirelli, I just wanted to say hi.  All right.  Damn, Bill fucking finds that.  Yeah, we've been talking to him for years.  I've never noticed.  He just wraps everything up with booze or pussy.  What are you talking about?  No, I can't wait for him to call back.  I don't know.  We didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.  I mean, I'm sitting here with my cock in my hand.  We need some sort of exit strategy.  I've got to have a drink. 
[02:25:30]  Can't wait to hear him now.  I heard that Mr. T's doing the navigation system on some of the vehicles.  He's going to be screaming directions out at you.  Left turn, right turn.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be pretty annoying when I listen to it after about a quarter fucking Jameson.  And a chick sitting in the passenger seat with her muff showing.  Anyways, the Giants had a rough game.  He knows his sports, booze, and pussy.  Yeah, another one of the owners of the Giants just died. 
[02:26:00]  I'm dying for some pussy over here.  All right, GPS with Mr. T.  Yes.  Company decided.  Oh, my God.  Let's just do it.  Deja vu.  Let's just do it.  That celebrities should be doing some of these and make it a little more entertaining  than the generic female voice in the GPS systems.  So you could pretty much get Mr. T to do it.  Mr. T.  Now, I'm not sure.  Is this going to be like you punch in the directions and they run through all the directions? 
[02:26:30]  Or is it just going to be a little incentive while you're driving?  Like every so often in between the left turn, right turn is, you know,  hey, make sure you keep your eyes open.  You know, don't fall asleep at the wheel, fool.  Something like that.  Or is it, are they going to sit them in a studio and go, lift, turn right, go straight,  one mile, two mile, three mile, quarter mile, and then have somebody cut it all up and then  put it together like they do.  You know, it's not like Mr. T has to drive around with a tape recorder over every road in 
[02:27:00]  the country.  Boy, this is going to take a long time.  All right.  We got to cover every single highway.  We're in Nebraska now.  Make a right turn.  Way to get to the car for you.  Mr. T, you don't have anything else to do.  I think you can handle this one.  I didn't know we had to do this in real time.  This really sucks.  In a hundred miles, you're going to be getting on a bridge or some shit.  And Mr. T going to be with you.  Well, we got an example of his fine work.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, this is Mr. T. Pay attention to what I'm saying.  You heard me.  This is Mr. T. Not one of the mother of two-bit actors that could be doing a lot of stuff  or whatnot.  They might sound funny and whatnot.  That's all.  It's just funny.  They jokes.  But when you ride with Mr. T, Mr. T going to get you there in one piece.  He's going to get you there in fun.  Your kid's going to act right.  And you're going to get the direction.  You're going to be there safely or else.  That would make me drive into a pole.  Of course.  Just to make it stop.  But he's not giving you direction.  So what is this about?  I don't know.  That's the intro as you're lost. 
[02:28:00]  Losing your shit.  Does that just pop up in between?  Yeah, you're lost.  And that's what you need.  Come on.  You're going to get there safe.  There could be other people doing this, but they have jobs.  Miss T need work.  Stay in drugs.  Get the kids out of school.  Stay team.  All right.  A quarter mile up, you're going to hit a ramp hidden by a log and flip the Jeep over.  And then when you make a right turn, pull out your machine guns and fire widely, but make sure no one gets killed because it's A team and we never killed nobody. 
[02:28:30]  All that lead be slinging and no one ever died on the show.  What a bunch of faggots.  We got a second example.  Hey, this is Mr. T.  You know this is me.  I'm in this little box.  All right.  Two things really make me mad.  If you ever watch the A team, you know I don't like to fly.  Now you got me in this little box.  It's hot nearly.  Cut the air conditioner a little higher.  Cool me off, brother.  I don't like to be hot in the summertime.  Not like this here.  All right.  Keep the air on me.  If necessary, fan me. 
[02:29:00]  Because if I don't get fanned, I'll get you the wrong direction.  You'll wind up in the wrong area.  You don't want that to happen, do you fool?  Ha ha ha.  Oh, my God.  You can tell he's just completely winging that.  He actually flubs a couple of words in the middle.  And they leave it in.  And then one part isn't funny.  Then he just go.  Then he regroups.  He's like, all right.  Ha ha ha.  All right.  Something else.  You know.  Throw in a catchphrase.  Ba, ba, ba, ba.  Boom.  It's hot in winter.  Summer.  He almost said winter when he meant to say summer is what his gaff was.  How do you cut the air conditioner on? 
[02:29:30]  Do you cut it off?  Cut it on and, you know, when Hannibal, you're trying to make me fly, they'd have to drug me.  Don't drive on the drugs.  Boo.  Ha ha ha.  Ah.  That's horrible.  Let's go to Brad in Michigan.  Brad.  Yeah.  These GPS guys want to do this right.  They should get the voice for the kit car from Knight Rider.  I'm sure somebody would love that.

[02:31:00]  the Sicilian.  What are you?  Hi.  Well, we have  Burt Reynolds, too.  Hi, this is  Burt Reynolds.  You see this  navigational system  that cost you  probably $25,000?  Well, no,  it really does.  It looks like  it costs that much.  I suggest  you eat it 
[02:31:30]  and then  put it out  and sell it  for a dollar.  Uh.  Oh, my God.  Burt Reynolds  had nothing.  Uh.  Burt Reynolds  had nothing.  Uh.  They put him  in that room  and he had  nothing.  He didn't even  give the  ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, where  where was his  wacky laugh?  Uh.  Hi, this is 
[02:32:00]  Burt Reynolds.  You see this  navigational system  that cost you  probably $25,000?  Well, no,  it really does.  It looks like  it costs that much.  Bombing.  I suggest  you eat it  and then  put it out  and sell it  for a dollar.  What we're  dealing with  here  is a  complete  lack of  respect  for the  law.  That's  an attention  getter.  No, it's not.  What we have 
[02:32:30]  here is  failure  to communicate.  To say  anything funny.  You could feel  the flop sweat  coming off him  through the  sound clip.  take it  and  what are we  going to  I don't know.  Norm Macdonald  did the best  stupid  Burt Reynolds  impression.  Yeah, of course.  God damn,  it was right on  the money.  The guy  has nothing.  Let's go to  Ken.  Ken?  Hey.  Hey.  Didn't they do  the same thing  in New York City  cab for quite a  while with the  celebrities?  The celebrities  telling you to 
[02:33:00]  buckle up  and remember  to get a receipt  and take your  belongings.  Yeah, we all  said it was  annoying and  they got rid of  it.  That's all I  got.  I'm punching  out.  We should  have some  people from  the show  do it.  Yeah, more  than Burt  Reynolds had.  Why don't we  have show  people do it  from our  show.  Big A.  When  a mile  make a  You're missing  your turn.  Yeah, there  it was.  Make a  Huey  at the 
[02:33:30]  light  All right.  I'll show  you another  way.  Now, eat  it.  Wait, where  are you going?  I'm at my  destination, ass.  Thanks for the  help.  Can I come  in?  Why do we  have a  Is that  Bruce? 
[02:34:00]  In a suit?  My  God, man.  My  God, man.  Taxi.  Yes.  All right.  Anthony,  wacky big  sandwich  bit.  What?  We have a  wacky big  sandwich  bit?  Yeah, where's  Nathaniel?  Well, we're  entertaining  America.  Nathaniel is  surfing the  TV and  finding stuff  for us to  goof on.  Wacky alert.  Wacky alert.  And when he  finds something  for us to  goof on, he  gets it ready  and runs it 
[02:34:30]  into the  show.  It's a  puggle.  It's a  puggle on  Regis and  Cassidy.  Or whatever  her name is.  Kelly.  Kelly, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is that the  cutest little  thing?  Is there  anything  cuter than a  puggle?  I challenge  you.  And the answer,  no.  No, it  doesn't look like  a boxer.  It looks like a  puggle and it  looks like about  the cutest little  thing ever.  It's adorable.  You know what's  cuter than a 
[02:35:00]  puggle?  What?  A kinkachu.  No, kinkachos are  ugly.  I like the  kinkachos.  Puggles, look at  the face of the  puggle.  That looks like a  boxer.  It's a puggle.  I know what it  is.  It's half pug,  half beagle.  It looks like a  boxer.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, it does.  It does not.  Anthony, don't tell  me what I think.  Puggles are merely  adorable.  Looks like a  fucking boxer.  Anthony, can you do  your imitation of  the puggle, you  know, blinking his  eyes?  Blink, blink,  blink, blink.  The big puggle  eyes with their  long lashes. 
[02:35:30]  And he looks up  at you and goes  mm, mm, mm.  See, now you don't  know that was a  puggle.  It was a puggle.  There was no  graphic up there  that started there.  I know a puggle  because the cuteness  was pouring out of  the television.  I got 20 bucks  that that was a  boxer.  It was adorable.  20 bucks.  I'll bet you 20  bucks that that was  a puggle.  It's a boxer.  Nothing cuter.  All right, here we  go.  So, Nathaniel, that's  what he does while  we're in here trying  to entertain everybody.  And I guess Good  Morning America was 
[02:36:00]  doing the big wacky  sandwich bit.  Yeah, some guy went  for the Guinness  record of calories in  a sandwich.  Calories?  That's the record he  went for?  Yeah.  How many calories?  I don't want to ruin  it.  Yeah, come on.  That's what I do.  Otherwise, this might  not be entertaining.  The big sandwich  fit.  I ruined shit.  All right, so here  we go.  This is a great little  intriguing thing because  we love sandwiches  around here.  Oh, right?  I laughed at the 
[02:36:30]  way he said it.  We heard about a  young man named  Josh Matts, a 19-year-old  freshman, University of  Iowa, who had an  assignment about a  how-to project.  And something intrigued  him about the record  being the biggest  caloric intake for a  sandwich, 8,000  calories.  So he says, I can  beat that.  So he fried some  bacon in butter.  He assembled Swiss  trees, corn dogs,  ground beef, onion  rings, provolone,  cheddar, ham, turkey,  pastrami, sliced roast  beef, bratwurst,  Braunschweiger.  Oh, good stuff for my  Wisconsin peeps there. 
[02:37:00]  Liverwurst, wheat  bread, feta cheese,  Italian salad dressing,  oregano, parmesan, and  he fried it all in  canola oil.  That's where a lot of  calories came from.  Oh, 30,000 calories.  Wow.  18,000 with the  canola oil.  Right there.  Oh, you can't do that.  The onion rings,  1140 calories.  Here's what I love  about this sandwich,  though.  All that fried stuff,  30,000 calories.  But he took the  effort to make it  wheat bread.  He used the white  bread.  Yeah, wheat bread.  Oh, that's that 
[02:37:30]  whole joke we were  doing yesterday with  the Diet Coke.  He said, open for  Ben Sparks.  Right.  Because you are a  disgusting fat body,  private pile.  They do hit that  exact same joke  coming up soon,  too.  Oh, no.  With the Diet Coke?  Stop it.  The exact same joke.  Yep.  Can we bring Ben in  here so he can realize  what a hacky idea that  was?  I really like Nathaniel  because he writes for  the next track.  Diane Sawyer takes a  bite.  Hilarity ensues.  Did some of the  Swiss trees get stuck  in her teeth? 
[02:38:00]  Swiss trees.  Hey, man, he's live.  It happens.  I can understand that.  Oh, stop.  Diane, you're always  our little guinea pig.  Diane, you will be  my...  Diane, like back in  college.  Diane, Diane, Diane,  Diane, Diane, Diane.  Don't smudge the  lipstick.  There she goes.  We'll sing out.  Tasty, huh?  How is that?  Oh, that's good, isn't it?  Good eating.  Yummy, yummy.  A fun day. 
[02:38:30]  How is it?  I wish they had, you  know, eat one, get one,  freeze.  Right.  All right.  That bite was 800  calories.  Tasty?  Can we get a diet soda?  No, it's a porndog  sandwich.  Can we get a diet soda?  Because she just, you  know, I ate a big fat  sandwich.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there was  hilarity and it did  ensue.  Things in the TV room 
[02:39:00]  are going well.  Ben actually used that  joke yesterday.  Yep.  Actually used it.  Seriously.  Wrote it down like it  was going to be huge.  Yeah.  Might have made a  promo.  Who knows?  Oh, really?  Very good.  Make a left out.  Get out of Pat's.  All right.  What else do we have  here?  Everywhere you punch in  takes you to Foxborough.  No?  Anything?  I almost said Foxwood.  Crash night's out there.  It's somewhere northeast. 
[02:39:30]  Norton's at a furniture  store, Ed, in Cleveland?  That's a Steve thing.  Would you like me to get  him for you?  Oh!  Oh!  Nathaniel is the king  of passing the buck  and not taking responsibility  for anything that isn't  his directly.  That's his way of politely  saying it stinks.  Yeah.  And I don't want any  part of this.  No, I just believe in  honesty.  And I wouldn't be able to  What's wrong with her?  I don't.  You don't know?  Okay.  You know.  What about the 37-year-old  woman marrying a 15-year-old 
[02:40:00]  boy?  What's that about?  I heard that.  Is that real?  The latest in that whole  line of older women  and teen boys.  Is that legal?  Yes, it is, actually.  Where?  What state?  I forget.  It's got to be somewhere  down there, right?  Alabama?  One of those states.  Alabama?  There, Steve.  Steve, Norton  Furniture Spot?  Oh, it was a Cleveland  furniture chain doing a  wacky furniture commercial.  Some listener from  Cleveland taped it  with his camcorder  and sent in the audio.  What, it just held  his camcorder up to  them?  Yeah.  This is a disgusting  trend the listeners 
[02:40:30]  have picked up on.  Apparently, they don't  understand that the  TiVos or VCRs have  audio outs on them.  Yeah.  And they're just  holding up a shaky  camcorder and saying,  I got great audio.  Is this worth playing?  What is the Norton tie-in?  If you were doing a  furniture commercial bit  a la Bernie and Phil  kind of thing, it would  be worth playing, but  Standing By Itself, it's  hissy audio and a  shitty commercial.  But what's the Norton  tie-in?  That's the name of the  furniture store.  Oh, Norton's  Furniture.  Norton Furniture in  Cleveland. 
[02:41:00]  Good news for people  that have greater  problems.  What?  Norton Furniture is  here for you.  Now, seriously, if you  can't get credit in my  store, you can't get  credit anywhere.  Master.  Master, is that  true?  Yes, Grasshopper.  My name is Mark.  They were going for a  kung fu thing? 
[02:41:30]  How is this going to  make you want to buy  an end table?  It's not.  I thought he was  like a psychopath.  Yeah.  I didn't understand  they were actually  doing a kung fu bit.  It's just people  see, but it's the  only element of a set  would be the  furniture showroom.  Yeah.  It's not like a  kung fu set.  It's always just the  furniture showroom.  Every city has their  wacky furniture guy.  For some reason, the  furniture guys got  this.  Them in the car  guys.  Yeah.  They don't have to be  credible at all in 
[02:42:00]  what they sell.  They could just go on  and be so wacky and  zany that it doesn't  matter.  More importantly,  Ant, I want to make  sure Steve is safe  this hunting season.  Oh.  I kind of hoped I  could get out of the  studio before this  segment started.  Has there been a  problem?  Well, they got a bear  problem in New Jersey  and Steve happens to  live in New Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  I live in Jersey.  That's right.  That's in Jersey.  Every once in a while,  they allow the hunters  to just start shooting  bears in the fine state 
[02:42:30]  of New Jersey.  Doesn't matter where  that bear may be.  It could be in your  backyard.  They don't give a fuck  as long as they thin  the herd a little bit.  You're right, Bill.  Well, the bears in  Jersey do wander in  the backyard.  They do.  When a lot of bears  are found in people's  pools.  Happening on the  Sopranos.  Right.  Coming in the backyard  and swimming in the  pool.  So they want to thin  the herd a little bit.  They want to take  about 400 bears out,  I think, something  like that.  The animal rights  people come up and  they get all pissed  off.  They don't want people  killing the bears.  And then the hunters  want to hunt bears  because it's fun for  them. 
[02:43:00]  And then the people  that live in areas  that have bears want  them hunted because  you don't want your  little puggle to get  eaten at night when  you put the little  cute guy out back.  It's a boxer.  Well, yeah.  It's one thing to  want the actual,  you know, to not  want to hurt the  bears.  But it's another  thing when a 500,  600 pound bear is  staring you down in  your backyard because  it just happened to  wander in there.  Is that going to  happen in your  neighborhood, though?  It happens in  neighborhoods where  people want to be  in the woods by  themselves and then  they're annoyed because  they're actually living  with wildlife.  There's too many  people anyway. 
[02:43:30]  Well, it happens in  the suburbs in Jersey.  I mean, not  necessarily where I live  because that's pretty close.  Suburbs when they  started building, my  friend.  It was bear territory  and urban sprawl.  It was bear territory.  Urban sprawl.  And I think it's time  the bears took their  fucking land back.  Right.  Apparently that's what  they're doing.  Good.  They, they, I like how  he says they, Steve.  They're taking all our  jobs.  They want to take the  grizzly bear off the  endangered species list,  too.  The grizzly?  The grizzly bear. 
[02:44:00]  That's on there?  Yeah, because in like  the Yellowstone National  Park area alone, there  was like, in 1976, they  were down to like 300  bears.  And now it's up to over  600, so they feel like  it, they've made a huge  comeback and they don't  need to be on the  endangered species list.  They've only increased  by like, something like  that.  It was on, uh, 100%.  It was on Yahoo, if you  could find the story  there.  And that's enough?  That's enough.  That's enough bears for,  yeah.  That's enough bears for  the one square foot of  forest we still have left  in the century.  That doesn't seem like  enough bears for a 
[02:44:30]  Yellowstone.  Ramon.  We as humans, we are  so pompous.  There's billions of us.  But the grizzly bears in  that area, that's up to  600.  Good enough.  Occasionally the animals  try to cull our herd.  Yeah.  Makes entertaining news.  That's hilarious.  If some aliens came down  and took over, what herd  do you think they'd be  thinning first?  Oh, please.  They could be us.  They'd be gone.  At least the Chinese  would go first, because  there's so many of them  that they would, the  aliens would be like,  these types.  Yeah, they're like  mosquitoes.  You got it. 
[02:45:00]  Aliens trying to shoo the  Chinese away.  They'd be dead like  really quickly.  They'd just, you know,  hunting season open up.  Big mosquito truck.  They just spray that shit  out.  We really do need some  type of alien invasion  to kind of unite us and  get rid of some of us  all at the same time.  So whoever's left, like  the real strong ones,  real good ones, and the  ones that will be united  in fighting the aliens.  Yeah, it was.  The Aryans. 
[02:45:30]  I didn't have the  perfect race.  We'll be left.  We'll have a weaker,  weaker.  No, I think you really  ought to trim that  goatee a little more.  Yeah, no shit.  A little long on the  side.  A little wide.  A little long on the  side.  Here's the story.  Once again, New Jersey  has declared open season  on black bears.  The state has announced  its second bear hunt  in 35 years.  The six-day hunt in  northern New Jersey will  begin on December 5th.  It's designed to control  the growing bear  population.  Opponents of the hunt 
[02:46:00]  say there are better  ways to control the  number of bears without  killing them.  Yes, of course.  That's a fight they have  every couple of years  in Jersey.  So, do we have audio  of the hunters going  out and shooting at  the bears?  Oh, I don't want to  hear that.  Someone sent me a  video clip.  It might have actually  been a buffalo  pawl of a bear that  got itself up in a  tree in Jersey, and  what they did was they  put a trampoline  underneath the tree that  the bear had crawled up  and then shot it with  tranquilizers until the  bear fell out of the  tree and bounced off the 
[02:46:30]  trampoline.  Oh, I see.  They were helping them.  They were trying to be  nice.  Helping the little guy  relocate them.  Oh!  This is the audio of  the bear hunt?  This is the bear hunt. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, I think they'll get the  guy.  This sounds harrowing.  Must have been very  nerve-wracking.  Is this all in fast motion?  You can't take that,  hunting.  Oh, foul. 
[02:47:30]  What's Poe doing there?  Oh, I think I'll call you  the bear hunt.  Wow.  The chase was on.  It certainly was.  Glad to see you're okay.  They missed a bulletproof glass  on my hybride.  That's so stupid, but it's  funny.  is the fat suit audio good uh it's it's just entertainment tonight thinking they came up 
[02:48:00]  with this really cool bit of putting a attractive woman in a fat suit hey wasn't yeah didn't i just  wasn't they better check with howard howard might have invented walking around in a fat suit i don't  know we gotta check i can't chime in on that i understand bill i understand bill has had no 
[02:48:30]  comment all right uh et's vanessa manilio manilo wears a fat suit too yeah tara uh tyra tyra just  did this yeah so why is et doing this i don't know i don't know it's a little strange yeah i actually  saw this last night and her fat suit looked awful even worse than tyra's fat suit yeah and but they  put her in a super tight sweatsuit too just to really try to hammer it home that's all i got 
[02:49:00]  reverend uh reverend riot from uh cincinnati has a little thing he goes nice scenario space hitler  so i guess we're talking about the aliens before i never quite uh put it as space hitler  no i i think it's funny i know it's kind of past it's you know moment but sorry wow for interrupting  i guess that'll be on uh but they're loves and bombs are also traps uh they're also uh selling it 
[02:49:30]  as this sort of newsmaker thing space hitler yeah i'm sorry what were you saying space hitler  space hitler um but they're selling this thing as a newsmaker the fact that they put somebody in a  fat suit and it's them making the news about it like the follow-up is how they have a story on the  fat suit lady so it's really just not a wow so they did it and then treated it like it was news that  anyone cared about but they were the ones that were doing exactly all right good oldie  mary as someone in the public eye i've dealt with my fair share of people staring at me 
[02:50:00]  this is what tyra said the same thing exactly tyra banks said tyra banks are they hoping no one  notices that tyra banks invented this she did wow you're going out on a limb where's the tyra audio  do we still have that laying around almost i'll gradually get sucked in coming close to never  being booked on a program mary as someone in the public eye i've dealt with my fair share of people  staring at me but for the first time in my life i found out what it's like to have people turn away 
[02:50:30]  avoid eye contact and in fact do everything in their power to steer clear isn't this like  verbatim as they say it well it's far isn't this like really insulting though yeah you know well yeah  i'm gorgeous people usually like me now i'm ugly like some of these fat chicks and i can't believe  the response i'm getting this is unbelievable i'm i'm repulsive i know what it's like to be an ugly  fat fuck now and i really have sympathy for these people it is insulting yeah absolutely well this 
[02:51:00]  is how it's the same shit like these these uh jessica simpson going over there to africa yeah i  slept in a hut oh my god it was terrible i'm gonna get my private jet now and the exhaust will knock  over this whole village as she takes off the starving children and caught in the jet blast i'm glad we did  that their life does suck really makes me count my blessings for what i have  proddle up all right here's tyra starting her fat suit show let's see have you ever stared at an 
[02:51:30]  overweight person or size somebody up just because they were different i like tyra she most of us have  been guilty of judging somebody because they didn't dress like you act like you mostly because  they didn't look like you i've judged she's just like us i get thousands of heartbreaking emails and  letters for every day from overweight women who are the target of the last accepted form of discrimination 
[02:52:00]  they actually dread going out in public because of the laughs the stares and the humiliation  i know you are but what am i you may have been a victim of this and if you haven't i want you to  imagine what it must be like to be that person today i'm not just imagining it i decided to be that woman  and to go undercover by becoming 350 pounds okay to experience firsthand how we as a society 
[02:52:30]  treat people who do not necessarily fit in and what i learned has changed my life no it didn't i mean  that it has completely changed my life i'm going to share my experiences with you so that's how tyra  started her fat suit thing and now this chick from et said this last night and did the same exact bit  mary as someone in the public eye i've dealt with my fair share of people staring at me but for the first 
[02:53:00]  time in my life i found out what it's like to have people turn away avoid eye contact and in fact  do everything in their power to steer clear not only was it shocking but it was hurtful and i'm revealing  every frame i really didn't how is she getting away with this this is such a complete rip off tell him  fred for once fred say something holy crap does the exact same thing and this girl kind of looks like 
[02:53:30]  tyra too i mean similar complexion really yeah really not that sweet the weird thing is like  tyra only did this a week ago you would think all right hey i like that idea let's uh throw this in  a file and uh look at it to in march and we'll do the same thing hopefully people will forget a week  later oh i really didn't know how i would react when faced with my new reality but once i got out there  on the streets of manhattan it didn't take long to see that being overweight like this really changes the 
[02:54:00]  way people react to you this subway isn't exactly the kind of place that makes anyone feel comfortable  but it's a pretty awful place for an overweight person to be it was almost as if people thought  i couldn't possibly have anywhere important to go it's very difficult to get through the turnstile  obviously thank god i was surrounded by friends who were helping me because if not i would have  probably been completely utterly shunned embarrassed and abused well on the way out this guy was so 
[02:54:30]  quick to literally shove me out the way what amazes me is how quick people are to run in front of me  so they don't think that they can get stuck behind me as if i'm gonna take forever no because you are  because fat people do because they were thinking space hitler space hitler on the next chilling episode  of space hitler fat people how we can get rid of them all didn't have time for her stupid games  they're like look at this psycho broad in a fat suit i'm late to work yeah that's what that was about 
[02:55:00]  and turnstiles like she's pissed at the turnstile like in the turnstile was so narrow thank god i had  friends with me or that evil turnstile would have kept me from it's built for what are called a human  beings plus people you take the subway even if you're in shape if you're trying to run your metro  card like six times yeah yeah yeah it's generally around you a place where people are in a hurry  you don't see people laid back in chairs reading the paper go down in the subway station catch the 
[02:55:30]  next one people yeah i'll catch the next one fuck you go and people have places to be that's why  they're down there pushing and shoving in the subway all right right and if you can't out battle a  turnstile this living thing might just not be for you they were in a rush to get past me to maybe take  a seat yeah so so this vanessa from et she did it and she was on a subway tyra last week did  it and she was stepping off a bus i wanted to get out on the street in an area that i know is very 
[02:56:00]  prejudiced against people that are 20 pounds overweight and i was like you know what i want  to go out 200 pounds heavier and see how people react to me because i'm the same person underneath  same personality same everything oh it doesn't change the way that people outright treated me  the looks the stairs the laughing the flinting i was shocked she was shocked so that i couldn't  remember when i used tyra and now back to vanessa who did the same exact same bit last night on et 
[02:56:30]  once i got back on the streets i thought i'd check out some shopping but even before i got to a store  i couldn't catch a break i asked for directions to sax fifth avenue the guy said i have no idea what  you're talking about wouldn't you at least say well let's figure out where fifth avenue is  because i said i'm not from here nope you're in just because i was an overweight woman didn't mean i  couldn't shop like the rest of america but when i wait wait wait wait wait she asked for directions  to sax fifth avenue someone says i don't know and walks away and she assumes that it's because 
[02:57:00]  she's in a fat suit it's called living in new york it's right exactly also how come how come they  don't have video of that yeah where's the video yeah i want to see the guy whole camera crew right  there right do they have the camera crew no is it hidden camera yeah they have a lot of those  hidden camera stuff the fat suit dude it has nothing to do you could ask anybody you've asked  directions and gotten the same response skinny fat whatever if it's some guy who doesn't know where 
[02:57:30]  it is he's going to say i don't know not going to sit there and go well how are you today no i'm so  sorry fifth avenue though is that way you don't you don't answer you go no sorry and you keep walking  because again it's manhattan people are working and they're in hurries well hurries  hurries several hurries they're in several hurries at one time i've been in hurries it's a herd of  hurries i think her uh her angle is tomorrow she's going to go out in as her hot self and ask for  directions and then be like oh look people what a surprise yeah she's going to go up to a guy 
[02:58:00]  and uh stick that's just how it works yeah tough shit that's life that's the bird that's the bird  going up to the bird with the nicer plumage that's right and making the nest that's how it  works in nature let's stop trying to go against nature wouldn't have a job right good looking  untalented whore yeah how about her job that she's holding very good point exactly the job she has if  she was in the fat suit and applying for that job do you think she'd get it no so go crucify your bosses 
[02:58:30]  she won't do that i'm sure up like the rest of america but when i went into a ritzy store  i was completely ignored not one salesperson would come to my aid and i had the same color money as  everyone else i got the same treatment at store after store they could smell it they could smell  if you're uncomfortable and they completely disrespect you but as hurtful as all this was  as the day wore on i started to see that there seemed to be a connection between the way others treat 
[02:59:00]  you and the way you feel about yourself throughout the day i started out by not looking at people but  the more that i look people in the eye and i say hi hello sir when vanessa came out they treated me  like vanessa because you didn't look like a freak in a fake fat suit fake fat suit lady there is nobody  that is going going to walk up to me in a fat suit that i am going to look at and think wow that's  a fat person i would absolutely know you would look and go why is this person in a fat suit i think 
[02:59:30]  she's also blaming fat people for like getting treated badly she's saying it's because they have  a bad attitude that attitude yeah i noticed that she goes when she started acting like herself  she was treated better and looking people in the eye and talking to them and saying hello  so hey fatties get a little more assertive the fat suit is like the body toupee it's like everybody  notices notices but you're not going to say hey you're in a fat suit i don't know maybe it's just 
[03:00:00]  it's just too awkward yeah then they leave like dude they look so fake i don't want to deal with it  i know we played this like a week or two ago but we got to play a few more clips from the tire  fat suit special vanessa didn't do a good job last night on et um someone here on instant feedback  suggesting if she wanted uh directions to sacks fifth avenue just follow opian anthony's limo that's  right i would have taken you right there and uh a little known fact yes and i were in fat suits 
[03:00:30]  and that's why the limo driver treated us yes yes i was up to a 160 pounds were you here for the  tyra banks audio no oh my god all right we'll get a whole different angle on this there's like three  tracks we have to replay so tyra did the same bit that this vanessa girl did right and now she's back  in this in this studio with her studio audience looking hot again and now she's trying to get  sympathy from the her fat guests and the fat audience i'm used to people noticing me since i was 
[03:01:00]  like 18 years old so um i tuned that out but i couldn't tune this out this was a whole different  type of stare this was like a rude stare and this was a like i wasn't a real person stare  how many people were staring after so many hours of living this experiment it was taking a toll on  me but i knew that at the end of the day i could take this suit off others can't the makeup artist  todd earlier in that day told me that i looked beautiful even with all of the extra layers of 
[03:01:30]  flesh on my face i honestly felt great when he told me this i wish he could tell millions of women  in america the same thing i walked back to the bus to prepare for the last part of the experiment  and i was mentally exhausted oh the drama and she was honestly happy that someone said that she looked  good as a fat girl liar she looked like that star wars character the big mon calamari mon calamari 
[03:02:00]  with the big bug eyes so that video played and now they go back live to her in studio and she's crying  right she's crying listen to this  i was so hurt you guys and i know you guys you guys oh my god you guys it was so awful i saw you  some people giving me some people giving me some and everything being easy i had to get my own ice 
[03:02:30]  cream and they didn't ask me if i wanted a jimmy or do you call them sprinkles i don't even know  you guys you guys you guys the second you say you guys it was so hard being fat and ugly for six  hours i can't imagine what it's like for you really fat and ugly people to be like this all the time  six hours of it made me cry how have you not killed yourself you guys are so brave you guys 
[03:03:00]  the second she says you guys it takes any credibility of her emotional breakdown away  it turns into like a slumber party yeah you know you guys i love you guys it's so phony listen again  i love her whimpering  i was so hurt you guys and i know it's probably strange for you to comfort me but i was so hurt 
[03:03:30]  when i walked down a street robertson boulevard here in los angeles that i have walked down a million  times and the first i stepped off that bus and i saw three people turn around stare at me start  pointing and start laughing in my face look at the fat suit and the thing that hurt me even more  and i could say this to you was that they were black people yeah and i was like we're black  sometimes your own people treat you the worst the worst shut up and i don't get that 
[03:04:00]  you know what the problem is she doesn't know the rule of being that fat you have to be jolly  that's how you get through it jolly you can't walk around being this morose  fucking supermodel supermodel attitude and fatso body yeah doesn't work exactly you got to be  cracking jokes completely calling to attention hey let me move this so you can see me yeah  you gotta be the lights and i'd explode you gotta dance every once in a while right wacky maybe rerun 
[03:04:30]  dance and what's happening you thought that clip was good bill you guys so now she's looking for  sympathy right and she has fat guests right next to her on the stage now one of the fat guests has  comfort yeah there's tired ladies hotter than she's ever looked in her life and there's a fatty  with a sweater trying to actually trying to cover up a world of hurt and and she has to take what  is she gonna i'm out of her miserable life herself next to make oh my god you guys i was so hungry and 
[03:05:00]  then some bony ethiopian is holding her yeah she's crying listen to this i hate to interrupt you but  the first thing i want to say to tyra is i was very skeptical about coming on the show i didn't know  what food you'd have available you would do a story like this i thought she can take her suit off you  know why would i want to go talk to a supermodel about my fat i'm sorry it's but the fact that i came 
[03:05:30]  here and saw you and saw your true compassion and the fact that you were hurt when you got put in a  situation like this really hurt me that you had to go through that day and i just wish that everybody  could understand and just back off a little because an overweight person beats themself  up enough we don't need you to beat us up too it's a daily thing yeah 
[03:06:00]  you hear that tyra yeah all emotion thank you thank you so much thank you thank you  me and opie are gonna go out in those uh those uh sumo wrestler suits that were all the craze a few  years back let's just walk around and go try to get into the subway bang bellies right belly to  belly it's a jolly move everybody laughs people are into you fat guys at a bar something their team  gets a touchdown what do they do boom bang belly how gullible was that fat chick who was on there 
[03:06:30]  she should have gone with her first instinct this is bullshit yeah she got there she saw the camera  she saw the lights and said oh my god i get to talk to tyra why should i  bullshit tyra is exploiting my fat why should i be on your show when you're just a supermodel who's  going to strap this on for a few hours she probably buys shit off a late night tv yeah i bet that will  slice the onion a little quicker jersey john yeah you guys go ahead jersey hey these schwats didn't 
[03:07:00]  seem to mind that they've been discriminated against positively for being hot their whole life and built  a whole career on it yeah tyra banks doesn't have a talk show because she uh is a good talk show host  for all the bad that the fat people get out there all the bad that they get that she's exposing tyra  banks gets good there are there are regular people average weight average height average looks that  go around on a daily basis that aren't weighted on hand and foot like tyra banks is that's you know  does hair and makeup done yeah does she see what she's doing is bad because the average human 
[03:07:30]  that is walking this planet isn't getting all the perks that she's getting it's no worse for a fat  person i think the scale from fat person to average person is the same from average person to tyra banks  you know it's all relative i think you make a good point space hitler would know what to do  you know ben makes a good point oh who's telling fred oh travis makes a good point tyra's last show  was the supermodel show where she judged people by their looks she would sit there with a panel of 
[03:08:00]  judges and say what's wrong with these hot chicks like really beating them up there's no consistency  in her emotions line four is a great point all right let's go to brian in tennessee brian yeah hey brian  hey yeah um i know my ex-girlfriend she used to love to watch this show america's next top model  right tabra banks were bringing these rookie young 18 and 19 year olds who were 90 pounds and judge  them on their looks yeah and photos and all that shit you know you make a great point it's a 
[03:08:30]  completely different tyra she's telling uh these chicks they're too fat to model they don't have  the right look they don't have the right hair they don't have this they don't have that they don't  have a good smile their face is too long their nose is too long she just tells him just tells it  like it is beats them up on uh on tv pat from unaki saying uh do you think she said to the staff  just watch i'll get a fatso to console me ha ha ha ha like when opi gets people to apologize to  him she's probably sitting back there going watch i bet you i bet you a thousand bucks i get one 
[03:09:00]  of these fat bitches to console me looking all hot yeah thank me for being hot thank me for being  hot they'll be consoling me right let's see if this clip makes sense society in general expects women  to fit inside this box this package is supposed to be defined and what a woman is supposed to look  like and when you don't fit inside that box people treat you differently they treat you poorly because  you're not what they expect a woman to be i mean especially human to be in southern california a  lot of men see a plus size woman as being easy and the reason behind that is is because they figure 
[03:09:30]  because we're bigger we're going to have low self-esteem and we're just going to be grateful  for whatever attention a man might give us and so we're just going to take whatever it might be which  is usually the scraps so they think you're easy like you're just going to give it up  we should appreciate the fact that they're even taking the time to give us no matter what he looks like  or whatever right just there's just a little something coming our way so we should take it  and be happy yep yeah and they do wow like tyra you haven't well you know hot girls do that  shit all the time we're not paying for a drink tonight they can put on their little horseshoes 
[03:10:00]  and short dresses yup and go out there and they don't absolutely it goes both ways look if you're  look like that you got to understand that you were not dealt the supermodel hand so stop trying to  play it you got to go with what you got you got to be fucking jolly or you got to get on a diet  those are your two options jolly i just got to communicate from elo elo tyra is alive and well

[03:19:00]  We'll be an Anthony program.  Just shoot darts all night and drink.  I know.  Just reminiscing about the good old days when you could booze and not get a gut.  Or you could get up the next morning.  Oh, yeah.  Two hours sleep.  Didn't matter.  Get back in the warehouse driving the forklift. 
[03:19:30]  Just drinking.  Those were the good old days.  We had a stupid photo shoot and we're exhausted today.  Sit at the bar all night.  Just drink all night and then come into work.  No problem.  I used to be on like dart leagues where I played for an off-Broadway pub in Greenlawn.  And then you'd have your home games and your away games.  So you'd have to go to other bars in the general area, you know, the north shore of Long Island.  That's like one of those sports that's an excuse to hide your alcoholism. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, absolutely.  And you could graph how good your darts were by how much you drank.  At first, before you really had any, you were a little shaky.  You got in a zone after a few beers.  You could do no wrong throwing darts.  And then the curve would just fall off a cliff.  That's a bell curve.  You'd hit a point where you're doing shots or something and you just suck.  That's it.  You're done.  You're done.  Oh, yeah.  You can't do the shots.  You've got to stick with the straight-ahead booze.  But the whole idea of a dart league is ridiculous. 
[03:20:30]  You're in a bar.  You're drinking.  Of course you're going to get too drunk to throw a sharp object at a wall.  You're talking about the big fucking goblet.  Yeah.  Big friggin'.  The mug itself weighed like three pounds.  Heavy frozen mug of beer.  And you just pounded them all night long.  Two, three in the morning.  You're getting home.  You've got to work.  It's fucking Wednesday, you know.  Did you ever get pulled over?  Yeah.  I've been pulled over, hammered a few times.  Did you get convicted?  Let me tell you one thing.  You did, Bill? 
[03:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was a rite of passage.  I'm from Boston.  I was the best at being hammered drunk and not having anyone know it.  Anyone.  Even cops.  Even fucking cops.  I'd look them right in the face.  Carry on conversations.  Not slur a word.  And be hammered.  I had a restricted license one night.  I had one because I hadn't made a ticket and my license was suspended.  I had a restricted work license.  I'm driving my work van.  It was, I guess, 4th of July and I'm hammered and I got pulled over and I'm handing this cop paper. 
[03:21:30]  Now I'm drunk and I don't have all my shit together.  I'm handing him paperwork of my license that I'm only supposed to drive while I'm working.  And it's 2 in the morning on the 4th of July night.  But I convinced him that I was on a service call.  Celebrating freedom.  Just hammered.  I drank and drove since I had a license and never, ever got a Dewey.  Never got a Dewey.  And drove hammered. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, I had a good 4-year run.  Oh, 4 years?  It all came crumbling down.  I was always a beer drinker and I was at this party at BC.  A buddy of mine was going to school there.  Was this the first one?  And I was doing...  The only one.  My only one.  And I was doing my usual, you know, 12-pack I could have, no problem.  Like it's nothing.  Yeah, just sucking them down.  And then somebody took out Southern Comfort.  You know, peer pressure.  You know, whenever somebody starts chanting your name, you're doing something stupid, right?  So I suck. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, it's never like, you know, yeah, you invent that thing.  Or you cure this disease.  Or everyone's running, you go, go, go, go.  That's never...  That's something that you shouldn't be doing.  Because they're overriding the thought in your head that's saying, don't do this.  This is stupid.  Go, go, go.  So I did like three shots of that.  And I had season tickets to the Patriots.  It was like 1989.  I think it was like 5-11.  I was like one of the only guys who would hit every home game.  And we were playing the Rams.  It was the last...  It was the eve before Christmas Eve is the night I got busted. 
[03:23:00]  And I was like...  And I remember leaving.  People were like, you know,  Berman!  You got to stick around, man!  I'm like, nah, I got my 83 Ford Ranger.  Just started driving home, right?  With my waist-length leather.  The 87.  My jeans cuffed.  Just barely making it to the top of my white high-top Nikes.  And I drove home.  Whoop!  Whoop!  No, I don't even know what happened. 
[03:23:30]  Evidently, this guy...  Like, I flew by him somewhere in, like, Newton.  He was going the other way.  He did, like, the Adam-12 Huey.  Yeah.  To go catch up with me.  And according to him in the police report,  he chased me through a number of towns.  Oh, my God.  And he finally...  I had no idea.  Oh, man!  You were gone!  Yeah, I got a 128.  He set up...  They upped it up.  They said I was doing, like, 90 miles an hour,  which is bullshit.  My truck was such a hunk of crap.  He could probably do 80.  So, he pulled me over,  and I remember I was so drunk,  I was absolutely, like... 
[03:24:00]  I was, like, fucking relieved  to, like, just be not having to think  and just kind of, okay,  someone else is going to be driving now.  Someone else is going to, like,  be responsible for me for the rest of the night.  And he came up to my car,  and I was so...  I couldn't even pretend to get my shit together.  No.  And he came up to the car,  and he goes...  And he said,  blah, blah, blah,  where are you coming from?  And I go,  ah, fucking Boston.  I still remember that.  And then he just goes,  fucking Boston, huh?  You want to get out of the car? 
[03:24:30]  I'm like, yeah!  Fucking Boston!  So, I go to get out of the car.  This is another thing.  I don't remember.  It's all like a slideshow,  because I was, like,  going in and out,  blacking out.  He said I had a beer between my legs,  and I got out,  and it fell into the road.  Which I think I would have remembered that.  Holy shit!  Next thing I remember,  I'm at the back...  There's a lot of things already  you don't remember, by the way.  Yeah, I'm at the back of my...  the truck,  and I'm doing the alphabet.  And he said I missed, like,  L or something like that.  I did pretty good on that. 
[03:25:00]  But then he did the thing,  you know,  stand on one leg,  have your hands out,  and then you had to put your head back.  I couldn't even do that sober.  And then touch the finger,  so you notice...  I did fine right up to about 12 o'clock,  and the second gravity took over,  you know,  like when your arm's asleep,  and it's like somebody else,  I just, like,  whack myself in the face.  Then he goes,  all right.  He just made up some shit,  so he could cuff me easily.  He goes,  okay,  turn around,  stick your arms out,  and...  Now put him...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like you thought it was another part of the test.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:25:30]  You don't get rambunctious.  So now I'm still not really giving a fuck.  I'm so drunk, right?  And I was in the back of his car,  and I was saying all this dumb shit,  like,  you know,  I'm not mad at you,  just doing your job.  And they had all this in the police report.  So by the time they drove back to the town  where he initially started chasing me,  I'm starting to sober up,  and I'm realizing what the fuck is going on.  The seriousness of the situation.  And I'm like,  wow, man.  I'm really going down here.  So I come up with this quick plan,  like I go in and take the breathalyzer.  And the only option I had 
[03:26:00]  was when he told me to blow into it.  I was just pretending to blow into it.  I would just...  Oh, yeah.  They've never seen that one before.  I would just puff up my cheeks.  He'd go...  There's two cuffs.  All right.  Blow into the thing.  Blow into the thing.  I'd just stick my cheeks out.  Like, come on.  Blow a little hard.  Then finally,  a little rap to the back.  Come on.  Blow into it.  And I was so tired.  I was like,  fuck it.  And just...  And the needle's just like...  Yeah, I blew a one nine.  Wow.  Nice.  That's a party.  Didn't quite get the two. 
[03:26:30]  And then I...  And my dad came down  and bailed me out.  And he was cool.  He was just like,  yeah, all right.  And I'm like,  yeah, he...  My dad was always cool  when you fucked up.  He knows you fucked up.  My mother was brutal.  So then I end up...  I go down like the next day  and I had to get arraigned  and all that shit.  And they're right...  And they just like...  Everything I fucking did,  everything I said  was like in the report.  Wow.  Just standing there  and like the judge  was looking,  you know,  looking at the paper  and occasionally  would just be like  glancing up at me.  Oh, glance up at you  from the paper. 
[03:27:00]  And the guy's like really...  We asked him  where he was coming from.  He said fucking Boston.  And everybody in there...  There's like people  in there  and like breaking  and entering  waiting to get like  arraigned  and they're laughing.  Laughing.  And they're sitting there like...  I'm fucking going down.  Oh, shit.  Well, you gotta tell us  what you got.  What I ended up getting...  Oh, well, then I...  My dad's like, you know,  jumping in  and he's like,  this is what you gotta do.  He goes,  you need to get a lawyer. 
[03:27:30]  I'm like that.  I'm just...  They got me.  I'm done.  I'm just gonna plead guilty  and let me just get over that.  My dad,  you need counsel!  Right?  They do know people  that can kind of...  He hooks me up  with his lawyer.  Okay?  The guy turned out  he was like  a fucking tax attorney.  It's like having  a proctologist  for like, you know,  I don't know,  like a foot problem, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So we go down there  and I remember  he's reading the report  and he's laughing  reading the report.  You remember saying this?  Like, it's funny.  Oh, man.  And my dad,  who's a dentist,  actually met this guy  because this lawyer guy,  he got shit-faced 
[03:28:00]  at a party  and fell down some stairs  and knocked his teeth out.  That's how he met this guy.  So he's this Irish guy  and this is hilarious  to him, right?  So we go into the court  and he goes,  all right,  this shouldn't be  that difficult.  Just sit here.  I'll handle this.  And I go,  dude,  am I gonna have to  take the stand?  He's like,  no, no, no.  Don't worry about it.  The second the thing starts,  Mr. Burr,  would you please  come up and take the stand?  I'm looking at him  like,  what the fuck?  What are you here for?  He's pretending  to like shuffle papers  and I'm sitting there  up on the stand  and the guy's going, 
[03:28:30]  so you'd agree  under the penal code  or the 769 something?  I don't know  what you're talking about.  And I'm looking at him,  he's not reacting,  my lawyer,  and I'm just going,  look,  I'm just saying  that I was drinking  and driving.  If that's what that was.  Oh, no.  And then the guy's like,  so you admit  to the penal code  of 7609 blah blah blah blah  that you were,  you know,  so that I finally  ended up getting it.  They ended up getting me,  I got it right before  it was like the crime  of the month,  like you don't want  to get arrested for that,  you know,  they're going to show  like how tough they are.  I got like,  what do I get? 
[03:29:00]  I only got like 45 days  and I got like 80 hours  or 90 hours  of like community service.  45 days what?  Like no driver's license.  I didn't go to jail  or anything like that.  Okay, 45 days  that they took your license.  That's it?  Yeah, but they didn't count  like the two weeks,  there was two weeks  before my trial  or whatever  and they didn't count  those days.  Not time served  kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  So I had to go  to like drunk school.  Drunk school?  What was the community service?  What did you have to do?  Oh, I had to,  and did you complete 
[03:29:30]  all 90 hours?  Yeah, I did.  I worked at  Mount Sinai Hospital.  I used to bring people down  who had actually been,  like some of them  had been like hit  by drunk guys.  Oh, of course.  They got to tie it in.  Oh, dude,  it was fucking brutal.  And one of the  funnier things though  was in the drunk class  you had to go to like,  you had to go  to a couple of  AA meetings.  You had to go  to this drunk class  every Saturday, right?  All these fucking  drunk losers  getting dropped off.  What an AA meeting?  It's not like you have  a fucking problem.  You were out drinking.  It's like,  I never understood that.  How they got to tie it 
[03:30:00]  into the AA thing.  You know what?  I was 21 when it happened,  but I mean,  if you're like 45  and you're on your  fucking third DUI,  you know.  Oh, well,  then there's a problem.  Yeah, you look like  Ted Kennedy.  Yeah, yeah.  You might want to go  to a meeting.  So one of the  funny ones  was you had to go  to a mad meeting.  Mothers Against Drinking  and Driving.  And I'm terrified.  I'm thinking it's going  to be me  and like seven mothers.  You motherfucker,  I lost my voice.  Because the assholes  like you,  that's what I think.  I show up, right?  It's like 200 drunks 
[03:30:30]  sitting there  and one mother  who lost her son.  Oh, no.  And she's up there  trying to tell her story  as these drunks  are bitching  about their cases to her.  She's standing up there  and she's like,  Timmy was coming home  from band practice  and he got a flat  and then somebody's like going,  you know,  I drive for a living.  I only blew a .06.  How am I supposed  to bring a paycheck home?  Yeah,  you ought to be able  to drive.  And somebody goes like,  yeah,  I think they got a clause 
[03:31:00]  like the grandfather clause.  The guy's like,  I call it  the walking man's clause.  And then the lady's like,  anyways,  he was trying to change a tire  on the side of the road  and I was just,  he was such a good boy.  Dude,  that's when I was just like,  that's one of those things  where you just kind of look  at the demographic  that you've fallen into.  Like,  you know,  I really need to get  my shit together.  Yeah,  maybe drinking and driving.  I've always been  an advocate of,  I've known people  that one beer,  they are so fucked up,  they can't walk. 
[03:31:30]  Never mind,  get behind the wheel.  Other people,  fine.  I've always driven  better drunk  than I have sober.  I'm much more attentive  to what's going on  because I don't want  to get fucking caught.  I will stop  for every light.  I'm not talking  smash drunk.  That isn't true though.  It is true.  It isn't true.  I saw a program on this.  I've seen it too.  And every breaking distance,  things like that.  Fine.  Driving through the cones.  I'm not going to go  through the fucking  police road course 
[03:32:00]  when I'm having a few beers.  But at two in the morning,  driving home from the bar  with a buzz,  not hammered drunk,  but legally drunk,  I will drive safer  than I will driving  without a fucking drink in me  where I use sidewalks.  What a horrible,  irresponsible message  to put out to your listeners.  But here's what I want to do.  Here's my solution  to the problem.  He's got a great solution.  A drunk driver's license.  Here is a license  where you take a test.  Now the tax money  that would come in. 
[03:32:30]  He's getting serious, Bill.  You take a special road test  and you slowly get  your alcohol level up  and take a very hard test,  a driven test,  and you will be rated.  I don't like the tones.  Your license.  A very hard test.  Very hard.  Not just this fucking  parallel parking.  You're fine.  I'm talking cones involved.  And eggs.  Are children going to run out  in front of your car  during this test?  Yes, things like that.  A very specialized course  where you then have a license  that has an alcohol.  Why don't you just call a cab?  No.  I want to drive home. 
[03:33:00]  I want to go to the bar.  I want to drive home.  Oh, you're one of those guys?  Well, in the suburbs  or in the back  to get your keys?  No.  I want to drive home.  Suburbs.  There's no cabs.  You start talking about yourself  in the third person.  Anthony will be driving home tonight.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  On your license,  you would have something like  .9.  That's when you know you're hammered.  That is a classic line.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Don't worry about it.  When you've had to practice  how to say I'm fine  in the mirror.  I'm fine. 
[03:33:30]  Dude, I was so bad.  I swear to God,  I used to practice  the alphabet backwards  because that was one of the answers  on the test.  That never works  when you're drunk, though.  I literally used to do it.  I saw all my friends,  the biggest drunks ever,  all get pulled over  and they all passed it.  Wow.  Oh, I had a buddy  he got pulled over one time.  He's one of those guys  who just looks up in the air  when he talks  completely uncoordinated anyways.  So we're like,  dude, there's no way.  He was fucking hammered.  There's no way  he's getting out of this.  I remember he was  standing behind the car 
[03:34:00]  and they had the cop light,  like that blinding white light.  Oh, yeah.  He's standing and  you just see his silhouette.  It was like a Prince video.  As he's standing back there  and doing all the moves,  I don't know how he got out of it.  And he got in the car  and we're like,  dude, you've got to be  fucking kidding me.  Yeah, sometimes it is surprising.  They're like,  they're letting you go.  I'm ready to rat you out,  you drunk fuck.  Oh, dude,  just brutal,  brutal, stupid night.  I remember one night  driving and  I'm in the passenger seat  and I feel like  I'm sleeping  and I feel the car  like starting to bounce  and I look over  and my buddy  is like asleep 
[03:34:30]  on his arm.  He probably fell asleep  on me literally  for like three seconds.  Yeah, but you woke up at that.  I'm like,  dude, dude,  what the fuck?  He's like,  dude, I can't drive.  You need to drive.  You better drive.  It comes over me  who was passed out.  Now I'm driving.  Yeah.  Like I somehow feel more safe.  You're better.  Yeah, that's,  I think you should be able  to take the test though  and have an alcohol amount  on your license  and if you're under that amount,  it's fine.  Even if,  if you can fucking drive  with a .13 
[03:35:00]  and you ran through your test  and then you blow a .9,  cop lets you go  because I'm rated  for a .13.  That is the dumbest idea  I've ever heard of my life.  It is a brilliant idea.  You should call a cab.  You should never drive drunk.  It's a stupid thing to do.  Bill Burr says,  let's say hi to Zach in Arkansas.  Zach.  Good morning, boys.  What's up, Zach?  Anthony Cuomo  was pro drunk riding.  Great peewee story.  All mine gets one.  You didn't know my last name.  Billy Burr.  What's that?  Yes, sir. 
[03:35:30]  A buddy of mine  has got the greatest DWI stories.  Him and another buddy  are out of the baseball game.  They snuck in a pint of rum.  They're drinking rum.  They pick up these two sluts.  It's late in May.  They take him out to the lake  to get on my buddy's boat  called beverage time,  if you can imagine that.  So they get on the boat.  They're fucking around  trying to get with these girls.  One of the guys says,  man, I've got to take a piss.  So we're standing  on the back of the boat.  One of the chicks thinks  it would be real funny  to goose the throttle 
[03:36:00]  a little bit.  Oh, shit.  Keep in mind,  it's May.  It's probably maybe  75 degrees outside  making the water temperature  fucking cold.  So he's drunk ass,  goes rolling off  the back of the boat.  Basically,  when he hits the water,  his body just seizes up.  They've got to drag him  back onto the boat  like a fucking tuna.  They get him back on the boat.  He's so fucking pissed  he can't stand it.  Take me back to the shore.  Take me back.  So they take him  back to the shore.  He's leaving. 
[03:36:30]  He's pissed.  So he strips off  every piece of clothing  he's wearing  because he doesn't want  to fuck up his leather seats.  Puts it in the trunk  and drives away.  Roughly five minutes later,  the two girls  and the guy on the boat,  all they hear is sirens.  My buddy's passed out  and hit a fucking tree.  He gets woken up  fully naked by the...  That's a good one, man.  Arrested.  He gets taken to the hospital  and he's in the wreck.  But the best part about it is  after he gets out of the hospital, 
[03:37:00]  bailed out of jail,  he's delivering pizzas  for Papa John's  merely hours later.  Wow.  That's a great story, Zach.  Love you guys.  Be good.  All right.  Thank you, Zach.  All right.  There you go.  Zach from Arkansas.  Jordan in New York.  What's up, Jordan?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  First of all,  that license thing  has to be like Howard Spendley.  That was my idea a while ago,  but I like the idea.  And believe it,  I'm getting instant feedback.  Dude, what are you, stupid?  They never do that  for drunk people.  Oh, really?  I was going to present it  to the politicians  and really push this one 
[03:37:30]  as my agenda.  That's the best fucking idea ever.  Of course it is.  It'll never be adopted.  Anyway, I was 16 years old,  left the buddy's house  completely wasted.  We were driving to Burger King  and it was pouring rain.  And I didn't realize  right before Burger King,  a cop had his flashes on.  I pull over and Burger King,  he goes,  you know,  you're swerving.  What's wrong?  And I go,  you know,  I really couldn't see  in front of me  the guy was swerving also,  so I was just following him.  He goes,  let me see your license.  And I didn't realize  my window was halfway down  and it's fucking pouring. 
[03:38:00]  I went through  handling my license.  I slam my knuckles  on the window.  My license flies out  the window,  hit him in the chest.  I go,  oh shit,  my bad.  At the same time,  he's going to bend down  to get my license.  I open my door,  knock the guy in his head.  That's not good.  And then he said,  I couldn't find my registration  because I was so fucked up.  And my buddy in the front  gave me a PBA card  and the officer goes,  what's that?  And I go,  I don't know,  my friend's father's officer. 
[03:38:30]  And he's like,  well,  where's the registration?  I really couldn't find it  and the guy was sick  of standing there in the rain.  He goes,  all right,  stop drinking and driving  and let me go.  Let you go?  Wow.  Yeah,  somebody will get lucky.  I got lucky once  when I told that story  on the expressway.  I was drinking.  And he had me blow  into the breathalyzer,  but it wasn't enough  to bring me in.  And he told me,  I could have you sit here  a while longer,  but I'll let you go.  And I had a case of beer.  It was a case of beer  in the sea  because I was going  down to the boat.  Yeah.  And there were like  four of them  out of the case.  It's not like I said, 
[03:39:00]  give me a case less four  at the 7-Eleven,  you know,  and put that in my car.  He has to know  I drank those four beers.  A buddy of mine  had the best  like arraignment story  as far as like  the guy reading the story  in front of the judge.  They go,  you know,  repeatedly telling  the defendant  to stay in the car.  The defendant  got out of the car,  threw his keys  at my feet  and repeatedly stated,  lock me up,  I'm fucked up.  I swear to God,  I swear to God,  it's a true story. 
[03:39:30]  Let's go to Dan  in Oklahoma.  He has a great idea.  Dan?  Hey,  you need to get drunk  before you get  your driver's license  renewed so you'll be  drunk on the picture  and then they can compare  your drunk picture  to your drunk self  and I'll think  that's how you look wrong.  That way you don't  look so different  when you're hammered.  Exactly.  Thanks, Dan.  Punch it out.  That was a fun show.  Very good.  See, that's what we do.  End it with a man.  That's what we do.  Make up shit  and we get to 11 o'clock.  That's it. 
[03:40:00]  All right,  Ron and Fez are up next.  Yes, they are.  Have we heard from Fez yet?  He's fine,  but I haven't heard him  on the show.  That's what I mean.  Is today the day  he calls in?  I don't know.  Stay tuned.  Ron's flying solo  for a little bit.  Stay tuned  until they figure all that out.  But Fezzy's doing great,  right?  Yes.  All right,  it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Keep that going for us, guys.  If you need a wow sticker,  send a self-addressed  stamped envelope to us  and we'll send off  a wow sticker to you  immediately  so you too  can get wowed.

Something like that.  How many now?  12.  Bill Burr.  Is that possible?  Because it was actually  four to eight now.  Well, now it's six.  Bill Burr, thank you.  Thank you.  We'll plug your Thanksgiving gig  tomorrow because you'll be  in tomorrow again, okay?  See you tomorrow.  Bill Burr.  That's it.  Party is over.
