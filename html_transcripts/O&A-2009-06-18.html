<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a discussion of Mel Hall, a former New York Yankee sentenced to 45 years for raping a 12-year-old girl and other offenses involving underage girls. Opie recounts a past encounter with Hall.  Ed joins the discussion, adding commentary on Hall's crimes and prison life.  Listener calls follow, with one caller recounting a friend's 99-year sentence for similar crimes, and another discussing Bernie Williams' relationship with Hall.  The conversation shifts to the Red Wings' Stanley Cup loss and the newly launched Sirius XM iPhone app.  The hosts express extreme frustration that the app's description uses the term "The Virus" to refer to their show, omitting "Opie and Anthony,"  and lament the lack of proper promotion despite their contributions. They discuss the app's poor placement and visibility,  contemplate retaliatory actions like removing app promotion from social media and sending Sirius XM a bill for consulting services.  This frustration continues throughout the show.

A later segment focuses intensely on the app's inadequate promotion, contrasting their treatment with that of other SiriusXM personalities. They repeatedly criticize the omission of their names and the use of just "The Virus."  They mention a less-than-ideal placement in a USA Today article.  This segment also includes discussions about the hosts' illnesses (jokingly attributed to a guest),  a humorous anecdote about a movie premiere, a listener's unique show promotion in truck stop restrooms, and a demonstration of the "Say Now" app. Greg Hughes is mentioned in a tax evasion joke, and Bill Burr is announced as a future guest.

The show moves to a discussion about excellent (though balcony) seats at a Kevin Smith event, followed by Jimmy's Florida gigs and the poor performance of their radio replacement. A humorous anecdote about manipulating studio equipment to appear on-air is shared.  The conversation shifts to Curtis Sliwa's apparent court fear, Bill Burr's recent Conan appearance and subsequent online criticism, and dealing with online hate mail. Bill Burr, now in studio, discusses a cancer scare and graphic side effects of treatment.  The conversation turns to Muscle Milk, and Joe Rogan joins the show, discussing his comedy special, "Talking Monkeys in Space," sensory deprivation tanks, and marijuana legalization. They also discuss riptides, tiger attacks, and a gruesome shark attack/boat capsizing incident involving NFL players.  Finally, they discuss the UFC, mentioning Forrest Griffin, Fedor Emelianenko, a Ray Mercer vs. Tim Sylvia knockout, and a potential Shaq vs. Hongman Choi fight.

A segment focuses on boxing and MMA, comparing the strengths of athletes in different disciplines and the relative excitement of boxing vs MMA.  Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali are discussed, along with anecdotes about shaking hands with George Foreman and Joe Frazier.  The hosts mention various boxers (George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, Tommy Hearns, Manny Pacquiao),  discuss the brutality of MMA (Cain Velasquez vs. Czech Kongo), head trauma in combat sports, and share their own experiences with being knocked unconscious. They also have a lengthy discussion about the use of racial and homophobic slurs, including a story where one host was knocked out for using a racial slur.  Joe Rogan calls in, discussing his stand-up, combat sports experiences, fatherhood, and head trauma. The conversation touches on PETA’s reaction to President Obama swatting a fly, Tiger Woods' golf game, and an infomercial for a toilet paper aid, "Comfort Wipe."


A later segment discusses a "Biggest Loser" contestant's uninterviewed weight loss, sparking speculation about surgery.  They then cover the story of Thomas Parkin, a 49-year-old who impersonated his deceased mother to collect $117,000, and his accomplice Milton Romolo.  A bit follows with Primetime Sam Roberts and a new intern, Mike, whose attempt to interview Steve C. about his stylus use ends in his dismissal.  Listener calls from Dave in Chicago and Bobo (throwing used "handy wipes" at homeless people and Philly fans) ensue.  Bill Burr is in studio, reacting to discussions about the humane treatment of lobsters (including humorous, potentially graphic lobster-killing methods), a video of a man electrocuting himself on a train, and Burr’s new pit bull, Cleo.  The conversation then focuses on pit bulls, dog ownership, and humorous, potentially graphic, dog-related anecdotes. The show concludes with a brief mention of upcoming comedy shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  100% rain today.  Wow, they ain't messing around.  I gotta fly today, too. That's great.  That's always what you see when you're on a plane, just black clouds.  Black clouds ahead.  Good morning, it's Opie and Jimmy.  And Ant on his way in.  He'll be here shortly.  He'll be here shortly.  Mel Hall. Jimmy is obsessed with Mel Hall. 
[00:00:30]  Being an old Yankee fan, right?  Yeah, man. He was, I believe, a center fielder.  Mel Hall was kind of like a utility player, wasn't he?  I thought he played full-time, but that was in the 80s.  I was doing bad things back then, I don't remember.  Or 90s, maybe.  Maybe he played a few years full-time.  Then it seemed like he was kind of more of a utility player.  Played in the 80s for the Yankees, you're saying?  I think so, Danny.  Maybe late 70s, possibly?  Maybe you could check. I don't know exact dates.  Well, he's in a bit of trouble.  Mel Hall is in Dutch.  Oh, boy, is he. 
[00:01:00]  What did he get, 45 years yesterday?  Fucking ex-majorly player Mel Hall sentenced 45 years for raping a girl.  12 years old.  Oh, yeah, 12 years, right.  And I guess five girls testified at his trial.  Oh, is he in trouble.  And we met Mel Hall when I was, we were off the air.  No, we didn't.  I didn't say we file traded with him.  I didn't exchange emails with Mel Hall.  We were off the radio.  I'm trying to remember.  Did we really?  I know, I did.  I got a photo with him.  I remember it.  We were in Dallas. 
[00:01:30]  I was doing the improv years ago down there, probably 2003.  And we went to a Pugs and Kelly event.  They're friends of ours.  And Mel Hall was there.  And I remember being like, fuck, Mel Hall.  He played for the Yankees.  I took a photo with him, which I will be Twittering later if I can find it.  Of course you will.  That's a good tweet right there.  He'll be out when he's 93.  That's all right.  He's got to do, dude, he's got to do.  They had a bunch of, these weren't violent races.  He's, I guess, a pedo.  But I guess what happened, he was coaching a basketball team? 
[00:02:00]  But like an elite women's basketball team, I guess.  And somehow he got in trouble with the 12-year-old.  Yeah, there's all young girls.  There's a bunch of girls that testified that he was, like, inappropriate with them.  And there's a couple of them that are, like, a little weird testimony.  One girl said he just grabbed me, and I thought it was inappropriate, said a woman who's now 19.  So I don't know exactly what he did, but I know that he's got to do 22 and a half years before he's eligible for parole. 
[00:02:30]  Wow.  You know, look, I enjoy him as a player, but if you fuck around with a 12-year-old, I guess that's what you deserve.  You've got to go away.  In Texas, he was in Fort Worth, Texas.  They don't play games.  No, of course not.  Texas does not fuck around with anything.  He's lucky they don't execute him down there.  22 years.  He's 45.  You think he's, like, trying to keep his chin up, going, look, you know, 67 years old.  It's not that old in this day and age.  Yeah, right.  I don't think you'd do that at all.  I think you'd hang yourself in jail after a couple years.  Speaking of Mel Hall, welcome back, Ed. 
[00:03:00]  Hi.  Hack, hack.  Ah.  I'd have made it if it wasn't the fucking rain.  Good old rain outside.  I know it.  It was such a hacky thing.  I just said, I said, welcome back.  Like, I was just talking about Mel Hall.  Do you know Mel Hall?  You didn't hear about it?  Mel Hall's going to jail for 45 years.  For 45 years.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  He was a, you know, how do they wear 12-year-old?  Oh, yeah.  Well.  And he's got to do at least 22.  22 and a half years before he's eligible for parole.  So he's got to do 22 and a half for really good years. 
[00:03:30]  Don't cut anybody in line.  Don't fight because you're a pedo.  Don't yell.  Nothing.  No talking in the hallways.  Nothing.  People putting boogers in your food at the table.  There's no way they're going to treat him well.  Stealing your crumb cake.  We always do that.  You imagine someone putting a booger in your crumb cake and you just got to take it?  Take it.  What are you going to do?  You got to take everything they dish out.  Eat around it, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, poor Mel Hall.  He's an old Major League Baseball player.  I think a few people out there know who Mel Hall is.  I'm sure a lot of the Yankee fans know who he is.  I guarantee it because I remember. 
[00:04:00]  Wait, how old is he?  45.  He's 40.  Well, they're saying he's going away for 45.  He's got to be older than 45.  He's 48.  All right, he's 48.  So he'll be, like I said, 93 when he gets out.  A dirty birdie?  Yeah, man.  I don't know how old the kids were.  12 years old and the other ones they didn't say.  No.  He's gone away for a while.  I don't know if he raped all of them.  I think he raped a 12-year-old and the other ones testified.  I guess it's a statutory thing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he's in deep shit.  He is in trouble. 
[00:04:30]  So that's one of the big...  God damn, they said as the verdict was read, he looked skyward and swayed back and forth.  That's just like...  That's pondering.  No, it's not.  This is how it's going to look when I hang myself.  Yeah.  You know what?  That's exactly what that is.  Yeah.  Oh, he's...  Yeah.  What are you thinking when that happens?  Like, it's like...  Obviously, you fucked up.  You should go to jail for that shit.  Yeah.  But just as like the selfish...  You're selfish, obviously, if you do that shit.  That's not even a fuck-up. 
[00:05:00]  That's like...  I just need to get young pussy.  Like, he...  I gotta go to jail.  Yeah, he's willing to risk it all.  That's not a fuck-up.  That is like, I will do this and hope for the best and hope that I never get caught.  Or what is it like to do anything, say?  Like, with this one, it's like a shitty crime.  But anything to have the jury read 45 years.  And you just sit there like...  I think your life just stops.  I'm not saying it doesn't deserve to either, but what happens...  Let's say it's armed robbery or whatever.  Yeah.  What the fuck do you do besides go to jail? 
[00:05:30]  You go to jail.  Yeah.  You start figuring out what you could sneak in with your hiney.  And then they...  They usually spend all their time, though, like, I don't know, figuring out how to get out.  Not escaping or anything, but, you know, legal wrangling and reading their law documents.  And then some people just, you know, getting raped in the shower and taking it.  It becomes your life.  Yeah.  I believe it just becomes your life.  I think the day in court when they tell you you got 45 years, it's... 
[00:06:00]  That's a biggie.  You can't even imagine the feeling you're having.  But then about...  I would bet...  I would guess...  Yeah, how far?  Less than a month.  It just is your life.  And you're like, all right, this is my life now.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Because every time they talk to some of these guys that have been away a while, you could  see it in their eyes.  Yeah, this is just my life.  Yeah.  It's different than yours, but I get to watch, you know, HBO and, you know, I socialize.  And I think it just becomes what it is.  But there are guys who, like, and I don't know what Mel Hall's life was like without 
[00:06:30]  baseball, but there are guys that go in and out of jail, the tough guys, whatever.  For them, maybe, because they've been there since they were 18, 20.  They're used to going back.  They know the system.  They're tough dudes.  You know, they're not going to get their ass fucked.  But a guy like him, let's just say, I don't think he's ever been in jail before.  Let's say a guy like him, who was a Yankee, who had a great life, he probably makes a  nice living, all of a sudden just acts across your life.  A guy who's not used to being in jail.  Here's where the new life starts.  Yeah.  Not as good as the old life. 
[00:07:00]  I'd love to, maybe one of the listeners has been in jail.  How long does it take to, like, adjust?  I think it does, though.  What I'm saying is right.  You got to sit there and think, all right, well, that's kind of it.  Yeah.  You have your rituals for every day, and, you know, looking in from the outside, it  looks horrible.  It would be horrible.  I would never want to go there.  Jesus Christ.  But, you know, yeah, oh, today I get up, I go to the yard for a while, get my lunch,  I'll do this, you know, read. 
[00:07:30]  I think, I was going to say, if I could have access to books, I'd be fine in jail.  I'm not saying I'd be like, yes!  Rip the hard covers off and tape them over your butt.  Read them.  But if I was able to get books, that's all you need.  Let your imagination go wild.  And then when you dream, you know, when you dream, you're just not in jail anymore.  Wouldn't that suck if every dream you have, you're in jail?  It's like, could I just get out in my dream for a minute?  So let's think about it.  I mean, if you go to jail eight to ten hours a day, you're not in jail. 
[00:08:00]  You're not in jail?  You're in a field.  You know, if you get a fine sex dream, you're banging something.  You know, next thing you know, you're playing in the NBA one night.  So then you wake up and go, oh, fuck, I'm in jail.  Then you read a little book, get a little food, maybe get a little air.  And then you go back to dreaming and you're out of jail again.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Joe in Albany.  Joe, I love how we could simplify things on this show.  Dreaming helps the jail time go by fast. 
[00:08:30]  Joe, what do you got?  When Mel Hall was with the Yankees, he would pick on Bernie Williams mercilessly,  and they ended up releasing him because Bernie Williams was more important to the team then.  And he used to put his batting gloves in his back pocket so that after he hit home runs,  he could wave bye to the players on the other team.  Oh, because the glove would kind of like go up and down as he's running?  Yeah.  What an ass. 
[00:09:00]  He deserves all 45 years.  Maybe he could put them gloves in some assless chaps.  One of the girls who testified said she was 15, and Hall was in his first season with the Yankees,  which was in 1989, and this is just like ones that are going back to them.  Mel Hall's first year with the Yankees was 89?  89, yes.  Oh, we got that one wrong.  I thought he was in the late 70s, early 80s.  He played from 80s.  At the same time as Luis Polonio was with the team, and he got convicted for it. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, he did.  Luis Polonio, I think, got in some trouble, too.  Yeah, 83 to 96 was Mel Hall.  Rafael Septian from the Cowboys was their field goal kicker for years.  I think he had something with a 12-year-old, too.  So, I believe, I don't want to just say that without being 100% sure.  Field goal kicker for the Yankees?  For the Cowboys.  Yeah, okay.  Rafael Septian, yeah, number one.  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I want to know how good Mel Hall's attorney is in Texas. 
[00:10:00]  He only got 45 years.  I've got a friend from high school who six years ago was convicted of one count of inappropriate  sexual contact with a minor by a person in a position of trust, and he has 99 years, and  he has to do a minimum of 50.  I don't know how.  They actually say within a position of trust, too.  I like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like it puts an extra fucking penalty on you for being a teacher or someone who  pump up that charge.  He was, he volunteered in his church group, and he and his wife had adopted this girl 
[00:10:30]  and her mother, like, to help them get better in life, and it was, I sat through his trial,  and it was like a Lolita-type situation.  Yeah.  And, yeah, he had 99 years, and he has to do a minimum of 50, and the girl actually was  begging the court to give him leniency in his sentence, because she felt bad for what  she did to get him in trouble.  Oh, she kind of let him on a little bit, maybe? 
[00:11:00]  Maybe that young little...  Yeah, I'm sure Uncle Paul would have liked that.  How did he get caught?  A little Lolita.  Yes.  How did he get caught, sir?  The girl's mother kind of suspected something strange had happened.  The two had been alone.  She was walking like John Wayne, and Mom said, what's the problem?  You're either the quiet man, or someone's been creepy.  You know, there's a...  And the thing is, they had never had sex.  It was just...  Right. 
[00:11:30]  It was inappropriate, non-sexual contact by a person who just shut up.  He was diddling or something, though.  Come on.  You think about that, and you're sitting in jail going, I should have just went all the  way.  Jesus Christ.  You're trying to tell me he got 99 years for a hard-on hug?  Yeah.  He did something, my friend.  You know what?  You're right.  Mel was creepy.  This is, uh, this one, uh, they said he was impressed with the 12-year-old girl's talent  and wanted to start a basketball team, and there was a woman, I guess, who trusted Mel  and led him around her kids.  She testified that Hall exposed himself to, uh, her and her younger brother while their 
[00:12:00]  parents were away.  It's like, he took his dick out in front of her and her little brother, and then he  taught the girl how to perform oral sex.  It's like, he was...  He was creepy.  That's creepy shit, man.  And he didn't get...  His lawyer isn't that great.  I mean, his life's over.  Mel Hall goes to jail for the rest of his life.  Yeah.  If you get community service, you have a great lawyer.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You're picking up crap on the side of the road going, this rules.  You think Bernie Williams right now is strumming his little guitar playing a song about  Mel Hall? 
[00:12:30]  You shouldn't have talked shit, you kid toucher.  Strum, strum.  Strum, strum, strum, strum.  It's my whole song, though.  Make it sound like jazz, blah, blah, blah.  Strum, strum.  Rob in Jersey.  Good evening.  Hey, Rob.  Yeah, I was just wondering, what do you guys think Patty from David Leonard  in a rally yesterday would have said about this?  Oh, she would love the word rape.  Yeah, rape.  Rape.  Rape.  He should have went to jail because he was raped.  So he did rape and he went to jail.  Rape, rape.  Rape, rape.  Rape, rape.  Rape.  It would be funny if Letterman just started defending Mel Hall endlessly and all he did 
[00:13:00]  was wear Mel Hall jerseys and free Mel.  Oh, my God.  How much trouble he'd get in if he only wore a Mel Hall Yankee shirt?  Punch it out.  That's all it would take.  That would be great.  How angry people would be.  What's he doing?  I heard Letterman had fun with the protesters again last night.  Oh, did he?  The haters, yeah.  He's having a good time over there.  It really is overshadowing Conan, too, which I don't know if that's bad or good for Conan  because Conan had so much under a microscope.  Is this kind of taking pressure off him just to do his show and settle in, or is it bad 
[00:13:30]  because it's taking the...  Conan's now running around with no clothes on in elementary schools.  Yeah.  Just trying to get recognized.  Getting some heat.  As I heard Conan sent a photo of his penis to Hillary Clinton.  I think the ratings come out today.  Okay.  Last ratings for Conan.  I think they know there's going to be a drop off.  It's got a hard build, man.  A drop off.  That's got to be tough.  I mean, let's be fair.  It looks like it was a free fall.  Oh, was it really?  And hopefully he could start climbing back up.  Who's this?  This is Robin in Detroit. 
[00:14:00]  Hi, Robin.  Is it cold in the day?  I want to hear Anthony enacting the first thing that's going to happen when he wakes up in jail  and the birds are tweeting it off and he realizes, oh, my God, I'm in jail.  That's what it would be.  Mm-hmm.  I'd hear like...  To-to.  To-to-to-to-to-to.  I'd be asleep, dreaming.  This is good.  And I was like, oh, my God, I was having an awful nightmare that I was in prison.  And I was like, oh, oh, this is... 
[00:14:30]  Mm.  This mattress doesn't feel as good as the one I should.  I was just waking up.  I'm in prison!  Holy shit!  Oh, my God!  Good one, Anthony.  Now, Robin, I want to...  Horrid.  I want to ask you something.  What's that?  Oh.  Red Wings.  Well, you know what?  Yeah.  They played so shitty that game, they deserved to lose. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Nice game seven, though.  It was, but not...  I mean, they played like they were up three games to nothing in a series, and they needed  to take a nap, for Christ's sake.  I feel like when you have to rationalize that your team was shitty, and that gets you through.  Like, you wanted them to win anyway, but then you go, ah, they played like shit!  Yeah.  Anyway.  But they lost.  I think the Penguins just wanted it a little more.  A little more.  Oh, they won by two goals that last game, right?  I think I watched it a couple minutes before the end of it.  It was a good game seven, Robin. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, it was good, but...  Went to game seven is what she's probably thinking.  Don't worry.  Within three or four months, people will forget that the Red Wings were even in the Stanley  Cup Finals.  Oh, come on.  That's just a low blow.  Well, like I said, it's a better team on that day one, so what the hell are you going  to do?  Phillies won the World Series against who?  I know.  Yeah.  Oh, you do know?  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, I don't know.  You know. 
[00:16:00]  Ask me the question again.  Phillies won the World Series against who?  Oh, Christ.  I don't remember.  See?  Oh, my God.  No one remembers.  That's what happens.  I don't remember who played against the Steelers in the damn Super Bowl.  And you know what?  I have to be completely honest.  I don't know who the Phillies beat in the World Series as I sit here.  You forget so fast.  Yeah, you really do.  Yeah, we did. 
[00:16:30]  Once it's over, a second place doesn't mean shit as much as a last place.  And I think, Robin, you're a sports fan.  I could kind of tell, but you don't know.  God, that is really something.  It happens all the time, though.  Steelers win the Super Bowl against who?  Against who?  For real.  What's funny is the Lions win 0-16, and they don't look any better now than the second  place did.  Yeah, right.  But is there a person in the room without looking at the computer that could tell me who was  in the Super Bowl with the Steelers?  This is a little exercise.  Oh, there's people out there, hardcore sports fans going, whoa. 
[00:17:00]  But the average person, kind of like us.  Yeah.  Probably the Steelers fans and all, but we sure don't.  See?  Not one person knows.  I wouldn't know.  Thank you.  There goes Robin.  It's terrible.  We don't need the answer.  I don't really care.  Second place rocks.  Hey, big news in the tech world.  I'll tell you some third world fucking country little kids know.  Yeah.  They're wearing them championship shirts with their names on them.  Absolutely.  Big news in the tech world.  Sirius XM Radio is looking to attract some new subscribers through the launch of a new 
[00:17:30]  iPhone application.  Subscribers through the radio service can receive the station's programming on Apple  Apple's iPhone starting today, so if you do subscribe to the internet option, you'll  receive the new service at no cost, while others will have to pay about $3 a month.

[00:20:30]  Dodgy  And then my network just disappeared  It just disappeared  I could not  It wasn't identifying my home network  Or any other network  And then it just started working  Out of nowhere  But I kind of like the features  The little landscape mode typing  And stuff like that  Right, right, right  For that  There are a lot of good things on there  But once I get the new phone  See, look  I just downloaded that app, by the way  While we were talking  Get us on your iPhone  That's all I care about right now  I am a serious subscriber  I am an XM subscriber 
[00:21:00]  All right, I am a serious subscriber  Username, password  That could be a problem  Oh, that's right  You don't know your username?  Who does?  Do you know yours?  For here?  I know mine  For listening to Sirius at home  If you need to put it  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do  For real?  Yeah, yeah  Keith  Text me my password  So now we can't get us on the iPhone  Dude, I don't know how to do  I don't know the online stuff  I'm sure I have a  Because I have it in my truck  I have XM  And I have the best of Sirius  I mean Sirius is the best of XM  I don't know how to do 
[00:21:30]  It's confusing  Online  I got radios  I'm very frightened  I have radios that get XM  But don't get the best of Sirius  I got Sirius radios  That get the best of XM  I got just radios that have Sirius  It's very confusing  Fucking people around here  Sure can't keep a secret  Like I've heard rumors about this shit  And then nothing concrete  And then it's here  Yeah, yeah  Bastards have been helping us out  I have Sirius on my Sonos system at home  So I know I have it  What?  What?  It's different?  Yeah, everything is different  But I also have it on my Mustang  Doesn't matter  There we go 
[00:22:00]  You need  If you want to listen on the iPhone  It's  I have to pay more  It's additional  But it says  But you don't have premium  You have regular  But I want premium  So do I  It's all very confusing  But what happened?  We got to make it just one thing  One very easy thing  They used to give subs away like candy  Oh, I know  To everybody we wanted  No kidding  I had like third generation's cousins  Eighth removed  That were like  Hey, thanks 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, we got to now pay  We got to now pay for radio  So that's wonderful  I got to pay to hear myself on my iPhone?  Yes, of course you do  It's cool  You can get Opie and Anthony on this  But you wouldn't know that from reading the  Oh, no  Description  Oh, no  When you go to applications  It says SiriusXM now playing on your iPhone touch  This is the app description  Yeah  So you can listen to programming you love on SiriusXM  On your new iPhone, iPod touch  Hear exclusive music  All 100% commercial free  If Bob Edwards is on there  I'm going down the hall  And I'm punching someone 
[00:23:00]  No, no, no  There's some good comedy listings though  Only SiriusXM brings you  Bruce Springsteen's E Street Radio  Eminem's Shade 45  And the Grateful Dead channel  Four hours a year Eminem, by the way  Yeah  As well as  Advertising a guy that does four hours a year  Four hours a year  As your fucking workhorses are here every day  But, um  Fuck  Hold on, let me feel you through  I wonder why we're fucking frustrated  And the Grateful Dead channel  As well as shows from artists  Bob Dylan, Tom Pei  That's all music  Sports fan  Switch over to any of our 24-7 sports talk channels  NFL, MLB, Home Plate, ESPN Radio 
[00:23:30]  Alright, Need a Laugh  Should be in here  Don't we make people laugh?  Occasionally  Occasionally  Scroll down to our comedy channels  Including The Fox Hole  Produced by Jamie Fox  Or Raw Dog Comedy with Jim Brewer  Just want to talk?  Tune in to one of our many talk and entertainment channels  With radios big  Including Oprah Winfrey and Martha Stewart  Talk shows on POTUS  Health on Doctor Radio  Bah, bah, bah  You'll find it  No mention whatsoever  Whoever's in marketing here  Here's what it is 
[00:24:00]  They honestly don't think  That we have one ounce of ability to sell units  No  It's gotta be  If they did think that  We would be in the  They don't think this show  Has one ounce of ability to sell  Unless there's something I'm completely missing  Where's this going out to?  This is not going out anywhere  This is when you go to your  If you go to the app feature on your iPhone  And it takes you to the app store  And you put in Sirius  And you find the Sirius application  Every app that you want to get  Has a pretty good description of what it's about 
[00:24:30]  Is this the right one?  It just says Sirius XM Premium, right?  Yeah  Okay  So someone from the company had to write that up  Without a doubt  Am I correct?  Can I?  You know what?  Basic accounts restricted  To subscribe to Premium Online  Oh I guess you gotta subscribe  How do you do that?  So who is responsible for writing that up  And sending it off?  I want to ask Scott Greenstein  Why aren't we mentioned in this?  Why?  And then he wonders why  We don't want to be down that side of the hall 
[00:25:00]  And when 11 o'clock comes  We can't get out of here faster  These are all serious  We have a race to the elevator every day  It's the race  A race to the fucking elevator  These are all  And Scott Greenstein sits there  How's everything going?  How's everything going?  These are all serious  Artists  Except for baseball  So  Why aren't we mentioned?  Is there another one that is  XM  An XM app  It's the only one  I wonder why we're frustrated  And pissed 
[00:25:30]  Because we're treated like  Bastard children  Enough  I write you foxhole  God  Oh oh oh oh  What's that mean?  They show virus  Where's this?  It says it  That's on XMRadio.com  They show the iPhone  They show virus  But virus means nothing  We've been wanting the name change  To Opinette for a long time  We've been trying  We gave up on that  The bottom line is  They just don't think  There's not one ounce  Of recognizable marketing  In the show  That's all it is  I would love to know  Scott Greenstein's explanation  For this one  He has an explanation 
[00:26:00]  For everything  I want to hear this one  I got it  He's got a great explanation  For everything  I think it's just  I think it's that simple  They don't think  He thinks we just sit there  And listen  And go  Oh okay Scott  All right  All right  Well okay  They think that that's  Once again  I guess we've got to  See it your way  Right?  Yeah  A race to the elevator  Every day  And you wonder why  You can't even give us  A little love  With this fucking app  Coming out  When you can't even get  You know  Howard's not even on it  So it's a perfect opportunity  To promote us  A perfect opportunity 
[00:26:30]  And I've heard the numbers  That we're bringing in  Are quite impressive  Especially online  So what the fuck  You're waiting for?  They just don't  There's some kind of  A weird thing going on  They just don't think  There's one ounce  Of recognizable  Or recognition factor  With the show  That's got to be it  I'm signing up  By the way  For premium  As we speak  Oh of course  Where's Opie and Anthony?  Oh they're  They're on their way  Home already  Oh that's weird  No it's not weird  11 o'clock  Race to the elevator 
[00:27:00]  Every fucking day  Christ  Oh my god  Oh my god  Underpaid  And underappreciated  And we're your workhorses  Thanks  Your workhorses  Guess who will be here tomorrow  We will  Not me  We will  This show will be here  Every Friday  For you  Chance to give us  A little love  And you can't do it  What the fuck  There's no way  That that's not  Let's promote a guy  That is contracted  To do four hours a year  What the fuck 
[00:27:30]  Someone had to write that up  And had to approve it  And if he's in charge  Of all the programming  Then I  I would love to know  His explanation  Why wouldn't you put that in  Why wouldn't you put in  An Opie and Anthony  My question is  Because it's all serious artists  Except for  I believe baseball  Is the only one  That's not  A serious  Thing  Yeah  So it's obviously  Somebody that works  For serious  Who just  I don't know  If they're aware  Of who the  XM people are  It's a marketing department  Writes it up 
[00:28:00]  But then someone  Has to approve it  Before they send it out  Right  I know exactly  Who has to approve it  I'm noticing  With the iPhone  Not as many mistakes  With the typing  I think they  They did something  I like the upgrades  They put on it  Yeah  Copy and paste  You can select  You know  I mean  It's a little bit better  It seems  Yeah  And someone's like  Since the merger occurred  Sirius can't afford  To promote you guys  Well there's not a lot  Of money rolling around  But there are free opportunities 
[00:28:30]  Like the one today  Right right  Everyone is getting  Their Sirius XM app  And the definition  Of what this is  Doesn't mention us  Not  Yeah we're not talking  About a massive  Five million dollar  Marketing campaign  We're talking about  Where you can throw  The picture in  We're talking three  Words  Opie  And Anthony  Yes  That's all we're asking for  For your workhorses  The guys that are  Working every day hard  And bringing in  New subscribers  Are they gonna try 
[00:29:00]  To put this  Not these joke contracts  Where these people  Have to work  You know  Every once in a while  And they're put  Front and center  It's amazing  They're not gonna  Try to put this  On some best of  Package  Which is why  It wouldn't be mentioned  I'm guessing  Is there anything else  They didn't mention  They mentioned Oprah  They mentioned Martha Stewart  I wonder if there's  Anybody else  They didn't mention  All right  Name on card  I gotta sign up  For Sirius 
[00:29:30]  I'm signing up  For Sirius  But don't you  Already have it  You're Anthony  Of Opie and Anthony  Yeah but I don't  Have the premium  So get it  Have them get it to you  No I  You know what  I'll just  I'll submit this  I'll eat it  I know I'm eating this  I'm eating this  Why don't you pay  For all our subscriptions  I'll do that  Subscriptions run the house  Subscriptions run the house  Marketing you'll kick your ego out  Jesus  Kick your ego out  Should have been a nice 
[00:30:00]  Nice day for the show  You know  Especially because  Howard's not on the app  Perfect opportunity  To promote something else  For once  It's a very  Do we talk to marketing  At all  Do we know them  I don't talk to any  Of these guys  11 o'clock  The race to the elevator  I say I win today  Trust me  I'm first in the elevator today  Hey when they don't  Put the numbers in  For what the expiration date  Is under your card  On an online thing  They just put the month  And then you gotta count 
[00:30:30]  One two three  Four  Like I would always  Fuck up with say  September  I could never do that  Off the top of my head  No  It's nine  I know that now  And July is seven  Because that's my birthday  Right  Let's see how this works  Sign it up  Are you  Spending some money  You're a good soldier  I'm fucking  Yeah look at me  Look at me go  Here's what I do now  Oh what happened  Please take a look  At the information below  Something was wrong 
[00:31:00]  My phone number  What  Phone number  What's that  I don't think I put dashes  That's nice  Wait what's that  What's that  We saw this  When we first  Came over to this building  It's been buried  Under a pile of  Boxes and newspapers  They never use this  And when I asked  To get one of these things  They told me  Oh no we're using them  For promotions  These things have not moved  In three months  Prop up table legs  They've been laying  In the hallway  It says the biggest 
[00:31:30]  Sonic boom in history  And it's  It's got a picture of Martha  Martha Howard  Oprah  And you guys  And me and it  That's a great  But this was never  Put out anywhere  No  Yeah because  The one person  Had a problem  It's  Yeah  This says  It says here  Just keep the one person  Happy and calm  And we all get to eat shit  It says Howard Stern  Oprah and friends  Good Morning America  And Opie and Anthony  Are all in one place  More channels  More music  That's smart 
[00:32:00]  Because people will buy  To listen to Opie  And I'm believing  I'm not just fucking  Being a whore for Opie and Anthony  It's the reality  They  I saw this  The first week we were here  Yeah  But they were buried  Under a bunch of things  And they've not moved since  Honestly  There's weird stuff  That goes on  It was probably  You know  Made to humor us  Knowing they were  Never going to use it  Because they  They do some of that stuff  Around here too  Look it's all set  And ready to go  Look at all the marketing  Ready to go for you guys  Here we go  I've asked every week  For one of these things 
[00:32:30]  Just to have in the office  And there's always been  Some ordeal as to why  We were not allowed  To have these  Here's what I think  My guess  That's a fake mock up  And I'll tell you why  I know  That's just  Because they would never  Use those two pictures  Of me and it  Yeah  We have publicity photos  That is a  A basic shot  That was probably  Taken by you and Rob  I just signed up  Invalid login  Try again  You mother  Either that  Or certain people  Who have  You know  Let's be honest  Smart contracts 
[00:33:00]  Get approval  On all marketing  Involving them  And wouldn't approve  Any marketing  That's fine  I'm saying that could be  I don't need to be  On a poster with him  Trust me  That's a complete guess  Trust me  Give me  Give me a picture  Maybe it's Oprah  Watch Oprah be the one  I don't drink the Kool-Aid  Like a bunch of other  Shock jocks  Donies  Now I have an internet  Now I have an internet account  I hope it's an AT&T problem  You throw your phone  No  I have an internet account  But my app  I click on that 
[00:33:30]  And it doesn't work  Let's see if this works  I'll try the internet account  You have to have a premium  Online account  I don't know if I do or not  But I just signed up for that  Why would the app have that  To sign up for  Don't be scared  I'm so frightened  Enter the text that you see  In the box  I hate those too  They're mushing those letters  And numbers around  Where everyone is invalid  What's a weird thing  You can do now too  On your text messaging  With the iPhone  The new upgrade  Is you can edit text messages  Like if you save all your text  Yes 
[00:34:00]  You can now edit  You hit edit  And a bunch of little  Clear circles comes up  And you can delete the lines  You don't want  Clear stuff comes out  So that kind of invalidates  Any text you show people  Like look what he said  Because you can delete  You can delete a lot of stuff  Yes  I do like that  Yeah  I like some of the new features  Yeah it's fine  I just want to get the new phone  Let me say hi to Brian  In Rhode Island  Brian  Hey guys  Hello Brian  Hey I was wondering  When XM was doing that promotion  With Howard Stern  Where you get them 
[00:34:30]  You know  The channel free for a week  Or whatever  If you guys had the numbers  On how many subscribers  That pulled  To the serious side  Because of that  Oh they said  It wasn't going to  Affect us at all  Which you know  We had to take that  And make believe  We believed them  Are we into comedy  Talk entertainment  Or obscurity  Which  Probably obscurity  Alright I'll hit obscurity  Probably obscurity  Alright well  That's all I got  Jesus Christ  It's not an accident  They keep saying  Oh no it's not 
[00:35:00]  It's just that they don't know  You guys  You don't have to know people  I just want them  To know down the hall  I can't find me  I'm so on to you  I smile  Because you know  I have to  But at 11 o'clock  The race to the elevator  Begins  Marcos  What's going on  I can't find me  Of course you can't  How easy is it  That I can't even find  Where we are  Are we under comedy  No  Talk entertainment  No we're not funny  Go to talk  So I know we talk  Yes Marcos 
[00:35:30]  I don't see us there  Hi Marcos  I'm sorry to cut you guys off  I just wanted to make a point  This really pisses me off man  Not for nothing  The only reason why  I got extreme  Is because of you guys  If it wasn't for you guys  I wouldn't even buy  This piece of shit  Fucking unit  That I have to listen to  Every day when I'm going to work  So  It really really aggravates me  The way you get treated  And I'm sure there's  Fucking thousands of listeners  Subscribers  That feel the same way  So I want to say this 
[00:36:00]  If they keep telling you guys  Like me  I swear to god  I wish you guys  Would  Thank you for the sentiment  Unfortunately he's got an iPhone  Obviously  He's probably calling from  On top of the AT&T building  Just can't hear him anymore  How do I take back a tweet?

[00:44:00]  Shitty virus thing  It's going to be a virus  It won't even mention  If it doesn't mention  Open Anthony  I say we just  Drink our water  Guaranteed  Categories  Again I got to  Figure out where we are  Where were we  Talk  Another day  Comedy  Where they let us down  Danny you know  Where we are  Talk  Comedy  Comedy now  Yeah  We're in comedy  It's not talk  And entertainment  It's comedy  Alright here  Virus  Alright good  It says virus  Virus  Sirius XM app  O  And

[00:45:00]  The show is mentioned  In the press release  But it's  You know  Virus  And there's the  There's the screen  There it is  That's what you get  What's it say  Virus  It says virus  Nothing about Opie and Anthony  Fire your marketing department  It's fucking horrendous  Horrendous  Fire your marketing department  First of all  For real  Because the virus means nothing  We've been  Trying to explain that  To these idiots 
[00:45:30]  For forever  It means nothing  Did you put  Because when we first  Came to satellite radio  They named our channel  For us  High voltage  Because we're shocking  You know  And we finally said  Fuck that  And then we wanted  Opie and Anthony  They wouldn't give us that  So we came up  With the virus  But that means nothing  Should just say  Opie and Anthony  Favorites  There  Now I just added it  To a favorite  What dummy I am  On the press release  We're  You know  We're mentioned  Oh are we  Yeah part of a laundry list 
[00:46:00]  Of everything else  So that's okay  But how does it not say  It on the fucking  iPhone itself  When the channel is on  You would think  On the app  How does it not say  That in the app  When we hit our channel  You would think  Holy shit  And they don't  They don't understand  That we get  Upset about this  And it's not a fucking  It's not some fucking  Prima donna  We want exposure thing  We want  It's just basic  Common sense  That if people  The next person  I run into  That says 
[00:46:30]  Oh where are you guys  Oh you're on something  Where'd you go  When you left  Fucking K-Rock  Where'd you get  Yeah that would have  Been a great time  To you know  Tell people where we went  But  We've been at this  Five years  Okay first of all  Once again  The virus means nothing  Especially to new subscribers  It has to say  Opie and Anthony  Okay  And secondly  You know  They buried us  On 202  Years ago  Because they were  Scared shitless of us  Because they weren't sure  How the public  Was going to handle us  Coming back to radio  Right  So a long time ago 
[00:47:00]  They should have  Moved us down  To a better position  On the damn thing  As well  We're buried in  Traffic channels  You're not going to  Just come upon us  Like I find  I find some cool  Music channels  Because I'm just  Flipping around  That area  There's an area  You flip a little  Too far to the right  Here you find  Something cool  You go a little  To the left  You find something cool  No one is flipping around  Finding Opie and Anthony  We're buried  On the dial as well  Change the name  Of the channel  And move us down  They're not going to do that  Of course they're not  And I just threw them money 
[00:47:30]  You just heard me  Because it's easier  Pay them money  Because it's easier  Than going through that  I got family  And you know  Some very close friends  That they want  They want you know  They want some units  Yeah  I'm like oh boy  Units  Sorry I you know  It's tough  God they used to  Give those things away  Like they're like  They're like doing nothing  Remember that  Because that's promotion too  You take care of your workers  If a worker wants  20 units  Then you give them  20 units  Because guess what  Those 20 units  Will be out there  And somebody's  Going to be turned  On to satellite 
[00:48:00]  Through that  The units used to  Be the product  But now the talent  And content  Is the product  That kind of change  It changes over time  So you're supposed  To just throw  Those things at people  But what do we know  We're just stupid  Shock jokes  So we're in the  Press release  Just to keep it fair  Mentioned in a long  Laundry list of things  You can get with satellite  Yeah I see that  But the SiriusXM app  Description  We're not mentioned  Jimmy  We aren't mentioned  In that  No 
[00:48:30]  In the whole app  The whole process  Of getting from  From subscribing  To listening  To this channel  You never once  See Opian Anthem  That is abysmal  Embarrassing marketing  That's terrible  And to tell you the truth  Ron and Fez  Are on the channel too  Of course  You don't see their name either  That's fucking  Terrible marketing  You don't see  So if I sat down  With marketing  I would love to ask him  So how does that make sense  What does the virus mean  Because that's front and center  You know when you market something  Whatever's front and center  Explains it all 
[00:49:00]  Yeah  What is the virus  What does that mean  To new subscribers  What does that mean  Really  If it says  The Grateful Dead channel  Well  It means you're gonna hear  The Grateful Dead  What does the virus mean  Do you think  If Martha Stewart  From a marketing standpoint  When Martha Stewart  Signed on  Or Oprah  They went to them  And said  You know something  We're calling your channel  The Microbe  And  There won't be any mention  Of you  Your name or anything  It's just gonna be called  The Microbe  And  Do you think she'd go  What the fuck are you  What 
[00:49:30]  What  Why  Right  Well  I have no idea why  Oh by the way  What I just did  Was consulting  I will be charging you  A consulting fee  Send him a bill  I certainly will  Send him a bill  Cause my brilliance  Now comes with a price tag  I'm sorry  But it does  No more freebies  A buck fifty  You want my brilliance  You want me consulting  You're gonna pay  No more free brilliance  None  No more free brilliance  None  From now on on television  I only plug my fucking books 
[00:50:00]  For my gigs  No more mention of the platform  Fuck this shit  Really  I'm like a fucking cuckold  You're putting a dick in my mouth  And in a lot of ways  And you know how you're doing it  And I'm going  Okay  Hey  Guess where you  Why would I do that  God am I fucking stupid  Let's say  Hannity has two million viewers  Why  Why would I do that  Let's  Let's do this  God am I stupid  If you want my brilliance  You're gonna have to pay for it  If you want Jimmy to plug  SiriusXM  I want nothing  I want nothing  On national TV  You're gonna have to sit down  And work out a little contract 
[00:50:30]  I want nothing  No no  I don't even want that  I want  You pay me to come and do radio  I'll come and do radio  That's it  I do my job  I'm good at my job  And I'm not gonna fuck around  At my job  And that's our arrangement  What a dumb motherfucker I am  I will guarantee that  I will do the best I can every day  From 6 to 11  And then 11 o'clock  The race to the elevator begins  And if you want me to stay here  Past 11  For anything  Pay me  Pay me  Everything now comes with a price tag  Everything  That's good 
[00:51:00]  We're in between  I'm the new consultant for SiriusXM  Pay me  For my brilliance  I like the fact you just named yourself a new title  Oh  Yeah  Because I have to  Yeah  It has to be on a letterhead  Because a bill is coming their way  You watch  Oh and they'll laugh  And then I'll go  No I'm really serious  I gave you some really good advice  On the  On the platform today  I wish my Mel Hall picture was here  God damn the thought of me  Damn you  I will be tweeting the picture of me  With duct tape over my mouth  You want to see a picture of me in panties? 
[00:51:30]  OP Radio on Twitter  What?  That's a picture of me in  Yeah  Why are you in there?  Why?  And they look like underoos  Who's panties?  They're just  Who's panties?  I don't know  She's in a ditch somewhere  Yeah exactly  I don't know what her name was  This is called a souvenir  In the industry we call them souvenirs  I cut her thumb off  I still have her license  I'll check  She's hitchhiking  I'll lock it  You know  We could spend another hour on this  But just  Because these guys have been waiting a long time  John in Jersey 
[00:52:00]  Has everything set up  And says your subscription is expired  Gene in PA  Bought a new truck  Took two days to get O&A on it  Elizabeth from New Hampshire  The Weekend Replays  Turn subscribers off of you guys  Why?  Why is that?  Let's find this out  Elizabeth  Hey guys  Hey  I really like your show  And I think that  E-Rock and Sam do a great job  But what I was saying  Is that it's just repetitive content  Because whereas  Like you know  I work all week  So I look forward to  Catching up with you guys  On the weekend  And we used to like 
[00:52:30]  You know  Kind of organize  Like what we were doing  Like to listen to your show  And because we could hear  All of them  You'd replay each day's show  And now that  As much as I like  What they're doing  E-Rock and Sam  It's like the same content  And then they just replay  That one program  Over and over again  Coupled with the ads  To go listen to Howard  You know  To me it seems like  It feels like  They're just trying  To divert your listeners  They're not still running ads  To go listen to Howard  Are they?  You know I think  Are they?  Last weekend  Honestly  Honestly on the weekends  I try to get away 
[00:53:00]  From the whole radio thing  And just get my head together  So I don't really listen  To the channel on the weekends  Please tell me  They're not still promoting that  You know they're not  Doing it as much  But they are still  Advertising his program  And it's  Alright  Advertise us on his channel  That's all we ask  That's it  Oh that's going to cost you  That was some consulting  Right there  Pay me  You know where that  Always goes  Pay me  So my consulting service  How much should  How much should I charge  An hour at?  Wow you could charge  Like lawyer fees  Like how big  They charge an hour 
[00:53:30]  How much?  So I'm a lawyer  And a lawyer with  Like the kind of experience  200  A half hour  200 a half hour  What kind of lawyer are you?  And what?  They round up too right?  Oh of course  Sirius XM owes me  $200 so far  Pay me  If it goes 31 minutes  It's $400  Nice  I think you're low balling  Yeah yeah  So in New York  You could probably command  Closer to like  $460 to $635 an hour  Alright scratch that  And you're going to bill  Alright so I'll be nice  $225 a half hour  Bless you and this 
[00:54:00]  Fucking tuberculosis ward  That we're in  Because of Iraq  Thanks Iraq  You motherfucker  I am sick  I have a cold  I have a sore throat  And it's guaranteed  From fucking when  E shit came in here  With his fucking  What?  H5 of USA Today  Rabies  Oh this is good news  Opie and Anthony  Made USA Today  Oh did we?  Where's that?  Cool so if I stay  At a hotel I'll know  Well you know something  Look  We gotta give a little here  Dude if they put you 
[00:54:30]  If we're on here  Let me see  It's  I mean look  We're mentioned as  A laundry list of things  But our biggest concern  Is if you  If you're downloading  The iPhone app today  We're not mentioned  And that's where  Most of the people  Are gonna be exposed today  Exactly  Okay okay look  I'm happy  I'm happy with that  I'm happy with that  That's good  We're in there  With everything else  All comedy all the time  First one up there  Right there  Is the Opie and Anthony show  I like that  Thank you  I can identify  When something is good 
[00:55:00]  And that is appreciated  And if you'll see  No one on the show  Is going  It should be bigger  That's fine  That's fine  Because everybody else's name  Is the same size  It's there  It shows the giant iPhone  Which is the  You know  The thing  It shows the app in there  And then  There it is  So I got no problem with that  We're just as big as  In the text  As East Street Radio  And  What do you have a problem with  Because trust me  All hell will break loose now  No I have no problem  With this  What part do we have a problem with 
[00:55:30]  I have a problem with the fact  That the app itself  Makes no mention of  Our show  It just says the virus  Which again  From a marketing standpoint  Not from a personal  Ego standpoint  From a marketing standpoint  Means nothing  The virus  Extreme talk  Say our name  How long have we been saying that  Yeah  Put the virus in the  Us in parentheses  Parentheses  I don't give a shit  Parentheses 
[00:56:00]  But the virus means nothing  Yeah  You know what  The virus  We came up with a name  When we were spreading  Across America  In syndication  Guess what  That went away  Yeah  So it means nothing now  It was like a  A fad  Right  Means nothing  Go to the hula hoop  And pet rock channel  And you'll find us  You'll probably find  Like a fucking  Jump rope  On the jump rope channel  Right  Yeah you guys are buried  In the college  Listen on 
[00:56:30]  Mood Ring 202  Miles  We're on Cabbage Bash  101  Miles in Minnesota  You guys are buried  In the college football channels  That's another one of my issues  But no one wants to listen to that  I like listening to that  The channel placement  Sucks  We're not gonna have  The beauty of like  Radio in general  Which we all  Know and love  Or you wouldn't be listening  To this program  Is stumbling across something  All of a sudden you're just  Flipping around your dial  Like what the  What is this  If your station  On FM radio  Is on like 
[00:57:00]  The 80s  Right  You never got down there  No one gets down there  That's like college radio  Or way up  At the top of the dial  We're way in the weird zone  Yeah  And I've been arguing  That point for a long time too  They had a perfect opportunity  When the merger happened  To you know  Move us down  Move the fucking channels down  Yeah  On both platforms  I don't get it  Ah  Now Anthony is one of  Howard's listeners  Since he subscribed to Sirius  Yeah yeah  Congratulations  They'll put that on  Something that won't have 
[00:57:30]  Anything to do with us  I'm sure  I wasn't asked why  I subscribed  Just then  You should have been asked  Let me say hi to  Jeremy in Maryland  Jeremy  Hey what's up boys  Hey  I have three different  XM units man  And none of your names  Show up on any of  Them damn things  I had to  I was down in my basement  The other day  So I can't get reception  Down there  I go on the internet  They cut me off  They cut me off  The damn internet  I had to call back  And read up everything  And verify all my shit  So it would work  Well that shit happens  Yeah there's gonna be problems 
[00:58:00]  I mean yeah  It happened with XM  With that  They were always trying  You had to re  Recall  They're idiots man  All they're doing is  Plug in their two other people  I mean they plug the  Playboy channel  I'm not gonna jerk off  While I'm driving to work  With my three year old  In the back  Maybe not you  I mean come on  Well maybe one  Make the kid drive  You sit in the back  Want a carpool  Well we'll now get in trouble  For bitching and complaining  Because we're part of  Some of the press stuff  But the fact is  The main attention today  Is gonna be everybody  With their iPhones  And you know 
[00:58:30]  And the description  We're not mentioned  There's no in trouble  The bottom line is  When you click on that  Virus thing  It just says virus  And there's no mention  Of the show  Extreme talk  It's the virus  Who wrote that  That's just not smart  Here's something else  I'm too old  To be in trouble  Said Mel Hall  Isn't that true though  You're like  I'm too old  To be in trouble  I know we joke about 
[00:59:00]  You know  Our ages and stuff  But guess what  I have to finally say it  I'm too old  To be in trouble  Yeah  And I have been in trouble  Off and on  For the last 15  Fucking years  And I'm too old  To be in trouble  Enough being sat down  With someone older than me  Sitting there yelling at me  Right  I'm too fucking old for that  And soon as you start yelling  I walk  Yeah  You know  Now I state my thoughts  And my opinions  I'll give you a little back 
[00:59:30]  Because I saw our names  In some of the press releases  Yeah  But I'm still fucking pissed off  Okay  Let me tell you something  Though  I gotta be honest now  Here  Regardless of  Take us out of the mix  Right now  Take our complaints  Out of the mix  Right now  And everything  This is kind of cool  It is a cool thing  That's  Like I'm looking at  Everything that's available now  Yeah  Like I can just  Pop my headphones on  And listen to this  Right  That's fucking very cool  That right there  Is a fucking  Excellent way to compete  With regular radio 
[01:00:00]  Yes  Because the iPhone  You put in the car  And you can get  You don't have to go  And buy the fucking unit  You put the iPhone  In the car  You can plug it  Into the system  And now  Your shit's coming out  But  That is very cool  That's why  I woke up this morning  I'm telling you  My first  Wine glass in your hand  Whose wine  What wine  Oh  Peter Frampton  Very good  Give yourself a bale  I like pills  No  Let it be known  5.30 this morning 
[01:00:30]  And when I tweet too early  You know  Trust me  The followers get  Fucking pissed off  Why are you fucking  Tweeting me this early  Now I'm awake  But I thought it was  Worth tweeting early  That the Sirius XM app  Came out  I was very excited  Hopi is virtually  Going from house to house  Virtually  Right  In the internet world  Shaking people  Going  Hey  It's Hopi  You up  Yeah  Yeah  We're on  We're on  I learned the hard way  Because I was tweeting  Too early  I'm like  Alright  I'll wait a little bit  But  I was very excited  Because I'm like  This is a very  Christmas morning  It was kind of like 
[01:01:00]  A Christmas morning  Today  It's great for the company  Like you said  Absolutely  This technology is amazing  Absolutely  That's good  APP  And then I'm like  Wow  Finally  We're going to get  Finally we're going to get  Some recognition  Because  You know  The big guy  He's not part of this  So my perfect opportunity  For the company  To push us forward  For once  It's not that conflict  Of interest  For the same company  Which I don't see  And that's where the frustration  Comes in today  That's all  Yeah  That's all  I'm summarizing now 
[01:01:30]  Technology itself  Amazing  It's going to really help  You know  Destroy regular radio further  But  Come on man  Yeah  Do the right thing  For once  Give us a little  You know  Something  Something here  How about  How about  So people  That have the app  That listen  To FM radio  That listen  To the Opie and Anthony show  Where big fans  Got this app  They're looking around  And then they go  Oh  Hey O&A  Opie and Anthony are here  Holy shit  Instead of going virus  Once we click  Click  Just  But this is how you  Counterbalance 
[01:02:00]  Because a lot of times  Portable units  People just don't want  To carry extra shit  And this is a brilliant  Portable phone  This is a brilliant way  To counteract that thinking  It's like  Alright you don't want  To carry a portable unit  You get it on your  Fucking dumb phone  And you can listen  To the entire platform  On the phone  It's like  I mean  It's fucking brilliant  Marketing is very simple  Name recognition  Yep  That's all it is  That ain't it  Ant's holding up his iPhone  Perfect opportunity  To push her names out there  A little name recognition  For us  And instead  Ant just showed me his iPhone 
[01:02:30]  And the virus logo  Looks terrific  But it means  Nothing  If you want to put  Virus on the top  And then put  Opie and Anthony  Right  Ron and Fez  Well we gotta get to  Know marketing  We should know them  Because they don't know  The show  No  How about you educate  Them on the show  And that's their job  How about you show them  The numbers that I've seen  We're doing our jobs  Yep  We're doing our jobs  Marketing 101  Name recognition  That's all you do  Is put the name  Of your product out there  As much as possible  What do you think 
[01:03:00]  Soda and what do you think  Coke  Pepsi  No  This  I think virus  But you're not gonna say  RC Cola right  No  Why do people say  Pepsi or Coke  Or Coke  Because they did a great job  With name recognition  Yep  I don't even know  If Coke is good  It's like a Xerox  Yeah  Copy  See  Name recognition  Most people never even  Use a Xerox  When they copy things  God damn it  My consulting fee 
[01:03:30]  Holy shit  I'm making a fucking fortune  You're way up now  You're way up there now  I'm charging for two half hours  And at $4.50  Yep  You do think  I'll give a little discount  Because I fucked up  A little bit in the rant  So they owe me $400  Nice  Yes  And I want cash  You do  By the way  In the opening  So I can hide it  From the government  What  In the opening line  Of uh  That was Greg Hughes  Who said that  Jim Morton hides  Nothing from the government  Because I had something to hide  It says here  iPhone, iPod, touch  Users can gang 
[01:04:00]  Oprah radio  MLB home plate  Martha Stewart  Sirius NFL radio  Opian Anthony  Jamie Foxx  Blue Cop  That's good  That's good  What?  And I'm saying  Where the mentioning  In the part of the press release  In the top  Is actually a good  It's a good placement  So to be fair  Alright so who fucked up  With the app?  Now we're down to  We're working this out  Live on the show  So who fucked up  With the definition  Of the app?  Whoever it is  It just shouldn't happen  That's a biggie  By the way  That is terrible  Everyone is going 
[01:04:30]  To check this out today  Yeah  That's into tech  There's gonna be  A million articles about it  They're gonna go there  They're gonna  They're gonna like  Fool around with it  A little bit  You know how many  Opportunities for name recognition  We're missing out on today  Because someone fucked up  With the definition  And the description  Of this thing  That everyone's gonna be  Reading online today  Because the one thing  That you get on satellite  Even though the music  Is great  You can't  The one thing  You cannot get  From your iPod  Or whatever  Or your music collection  Is fucking live  Talk content  That's the one thing 
[01:05:00]  That you have  That no one else has  Here's this one  Under entertainment  It says  Serious XM stars  And it says  Wine expert  Richard Torrey  And Judith Regan  Where's that?  It's laughable  Entertainment  It's Serious XM stars  Alright so we're on there  Right?  Somewhere?  Out Q  Gay Radio  XL  Morning Jolt  With Larry Flick  Okay 
[01:05:30]  Their names are on  The fucking app  Sure  Martha Stewart  Has that  Her big Martha name  Is up there  XM Book Radio  Sophia Kinsella  Can you keep a secret  Part 6  Road Dog  Trucking  Dave Nemo  Playboy Morning Show  Oprah Radio  Oprah  Everything is there  I'm looking  Every channel 
[01:06:00]  Is showing  A name  Glenn and Bernie  Beaver Brothers  For Kids Place Live  Comedy  Who the fuck  Is Glenn and Bernie?  Blue Collar Radio  They got names  Under there  Raw Dog  They got a name there  They got  Foxhole of course  Jamie Fox  And then the virus  Okay what does it say  To the virus?  It says the virus  XL  Sirius XM app  And then it says 
[01:06:30]  O and A  Slash  As if it's one word  O and A  Slash  866  969  969  1969  Just fucking  And I would believe  That's the number  It doesn't have  When you're pushing out  Name recognition  You gotta go with the basics  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  No one knows  I would love to think  The world knows the show  Trust me  We're all like that  That's why we do this shit  In the end  But the fact is  There's still a hell of a lot  Of people out there  In the radio world  That don't know  What O and A means  Why then 
[01:07:00]  And they don't know  What Opie and Anthony means  But at least you're pushing  The main name out there  Bloomberg Radio  If it said Bloomberg Radio  K and T  And then a phone number  Would you know  It's Ken Pruitt  And Tom Keen  Oh fucking  No  I would know that  Their names are on here  That's how I know  That their names are on there  It  XM Public Radio  Arthur Lawrence  The Bob Edwards Show  It's right there  Look at that  XM Public Radio  The Bob Edwards Show 
[01:07:30]  Prominently displayed  On the app  Where you can then see  That is  Why isn't our name there  So that again  Not for fucking beauty contests  Not for Prima Donna O and A  To be what  Where's our name  But for people  Especially the people  That listened on  Terrestrial radio  Regular radio  That said  Where the fuck  Did Opie and Anthony go  You don't think  A couple of them  A few of them  Might come across this  And go  Opie and Anthony  Holy shit  It's beyond 
[01:08:00]  Just getting to know  Somebody in marketing  It's not an accident  And somebody  Couldn't be that incompetent  That they don't  Understand that  I don't believe that  It's ridiculous  Because every other  Every other one of these  Has names under them  Every other one of these  That I'm looking at  Has a name  Not an initial  Not an and  It's just O and A  One word right  Yeah yeah  O and A  And then slash  Phone number  It looks like a web address  Or something  And that's where  All the attention  Is going to be today  Let me see it  And guess what  Fixing it for tomorrow 
[01:08:30]  Is too late  Everything else has a name  Fix it tomorrow  Name  Bill Bennett  That  And then when you go to us  I know it  You know it  We all know it  I'm fucking insane  When you go to us  I'll go to favorites  Jesus  There it is  O and A  Slash 866  Terrible  There's no  There's no name recognition  There's one Opie in radio  Yeah yeah  Opie Anthony  That's the recognizable part of the name  It's Opie and Anthony  But there is limited space  Yeah but you can put Opie Anthony 
[01:09:00]  Is that  That could be changed right now  Yeah I think actually  We did change it just now  But the point is  Is that  There's three lines  That are available  One is always the channel  So it's always going to say  The virus  Then we have two  Lines to work with  As far as pad data goes  So  Usually it's  O and A  The phone number  And then the topic  So we could  We could change that  To just say Opie and Anthony  But then we  We're leaving out 
[01:09:30]  The phone number  So people online  So what they need to do  Is change  Changing the name  The name of the channel  Right  Is key  Exactly  That's why  Yeah  Because then it just says it all the time  I'm not seeing it change though  It should  It's on a  Which we  You know  We want to  We want  The  The virus means nothing  It should be on the front page  Of the app  When I look at this  It shouldn't just say  The virus  No  It means nothing  It's a cool logo  But I don't know what it means  It is cool  No one even cares about logos 
[01:10:00]  It meant something  When we first got back to radio  It doesn't mean the same thing  A band would love that  Yeah  Well this is good news though  We got Bob the trucker  Bob  Hey there  Hey what's going on here guys  Hey  Hi Bob  Sorry I missed your birthday yesterday Jimmy  Sorry bud  Thank you  Hey listen  We're starting up the promotion again here  It's a truck stop  Bathroom journal  Shitters  You name it  I just wanted to get a little  Yeah Bob is  Promoting the hell out of the show  It's really  Really exciting  He goes into the 
[01:10:30]  The rest area  Bathrooms  Yeah  And he writes our names on the wall  Isn't that great  With little Jimmy Norton's phone number  By the way  Which is just terrific  For Jimmy  And he puts it at like face height  So if you get your dick through a glory hole  You can read the  The fucking show name  I ran out of steam on that one  Bob's a kidder  He makes it so small  And it's right next to the glory hole  Where you have to  Get really close to the glory hole  To read it  And then you get a cock  That hits you in the forehead  Okay  I want to apologize for one thing  Alright  Half of your rant's on the air

[01:19:30]  Beware  This is radio like  You've never heard before  Is pretty much the slug line  And it is  It's actually  For us  Shows you've never heard before  Because we're not listed  On Yahoo  No  We could have been on Yahoo today  What's listed?  Oh my god  It says virus  Oh god  On Yahoo  Right  That could have been us  Scott Greenstein  That could have been us  Why doesn't it say  It said  That could have been us  This is radio like  You've never heard  Why doesn't it say  Opie and Anthony  They're not going to be doing 
[01:20:00]  Another story on this tomorrow  It's too late  And you can't push this off on  Somebody at the app place  Just didn't know  Oh my god  Look at this  It could have been us  It could have been  All over every website  Especially because  You can't use Howard  On this thing  What are you guys doing?  Fucking horrendous  What are you thinking?  These are those opportunities  And it's like  It should just be  With all the bitching  We've done about this  In that office  You'd think  You'd think they'd go like  Yeah we should  You know  Put their name on the app 
[01:20:30]  This thing is going to be  Everywhere today  And  Ugh  Look  Ugh  You  But  That could have been us  Yeah  It said it's  Virus  Whatever  I don't even know  What the virus means  I don't either  It was because like  The show is kind of like  One of these word of mouth things  That you enjoy  And then you try to  Virus is spreading  Then you try to turn  Someone else on to it  By word of mouth  So the virus made sense  But now we're big  We're big radio stars  Yeah of course  Now we just got our audience  Now we're big 
[01:21:00]  Wow  That was a joke  Yeah  Some people don't know  When we're joking  Sargast  Who named your channel?  Well we did  Because they wouldn't  Accept Opie and Anthony  So at the time  At the time it was high voltage  Which we never wanted  Because we're like  Shock  Shocking  We're more than  Shock jocks  That is dumb  And then I remember  It was Rebecca  I got to call her out  She was a nice lady  But she goes  Well it's too late  All the artwork went out  We can't change it now  I remember hearing that 
[01:21:30]  Can't change it now  So we're stuck with  High voltage  And then  We're like look  If you're not going to  Name it Opie and Anthony  Then let's name it  Something that makes sense  And the virus at the time  Made sense  But now that doesn't make sense  And for at least a year  Maybe a year and a half  We've been trying to get  It changed to just Opie and Anthony  But to have it  Where it's like  Okay it's the virus  We're stuck with it  Whatever the fuck  But just to make it  The virus  With O and A  Like Opie and Anthony  It should be  Wherever you see the virus  You should see our names  So that way you kind of 
[01:22:00]  Equate the two  And after a while  People then will know  That the virus means  The Opie and Anthony show  But it's never  Never seen the same place twice  It's Bruce Wayne and Batman  The virus is seen somewhere  Opie and Anthony is  Well they're seen nowhere  So it's  Oh I got an advertising bill  Now too  Aw hell  So Sirius XM owes me  At least $400  For my consulting fee  Damn  And because I'm promoting  The Sirius XM app  On my Twitter  Because I got enough followers  Yeah  I'm charging for that too  Oh smart  $600 
[01:22:30]  I'll do the same thing  $600  $1,000  They owe me today  $1,000  How fucking weird would it be  If a check showed up  In a week  It will  Now shut up  They'll send a check  And tell us to shut the fuck up  $1,000  Hey  This is kind of on the subject  Kind of not  What?  But I don't know why  You guys don't do this  You know I did that stupid  Phone number thing  That say now thing  There's an application  For that now  Where all I do is hit a button  And if you call my phone number  You can talk to me on my phone  And I did it yesterday

[01:31:00]  Now here and there  And the owners  Of these places  Write me  And then call me personally  The excitement  In their voices  Like I can't believe  You chose us  To do whatever  I don't even  It's a general  Conversation I'm having  Right now  The excitement  And I think to myself  Why can't we feel  That same excitement  From the company  We actually worked for  Yeah  Why  We don't feel that  From down the hall  Why  But these guys  Can't wait to get us  On the phone  Oh my god  Anything you need

[01:32:30]  Agree with that  And you know  You gotta work on your  Gotta diversify  A little bit  Well you gotta work  On your farm system  You know  Cause someday  You're gonna need  Your farm system  In the big leagues  So you know  The opportunity is now  To get name recognition  Out there  God it's so obvious  I'm going into marketing  Next  Soldier Boy mentions  Say Now in his songs  And gives the number out  Wow  Yeah he's got three points  The Jonas Brothers  Got his shit load  But what happens is 
[01:33:00]  When you go live  And they just tied in  With Twitter like  Two weeks ago  And they can call  Your phone  Whatever your main phone  Is for your updates  When you call  I just call and leave  Voicemails  E-Rox played them  They're silly  Whatever you're doing  If you feel like  Leaving a voicemail  People can get it  And I can send a text  That goes to all their phones  Which you can't do on Twitter  People have to log in  This is a text  That goes to their phones  And a picture  That goes to their phones  Dude how great is that  But it's like  When they go live  They can just  They say when the Jonas Brothers  Went live for a few minutes  They get 100,000 phone calls

[01:35:30]  That's crazy  That's a little late  I mean I can handle it  But I can't  11 o'clock for me  And then get home  And then wind down  It would be after midnight  I wouldn't be able to do that  But props to Kevin Smith  Wow  First time I saw one of his  What is it called?  It's like a  It's almost like a town hall meeting  Yeah  Yeah  It really is  It's not stand up  Although  It's an evening with  Evening with  Yeah  It's not stand up  But he does get  A ton of fucking laughs  Throughout the whole thing  Kevin's a funny dude 
[01:36:00]  But he's not  He's not a  He's not the kind of guy  Who like you feel  Is trying to be funny  He's just a funny dude  And here you go  Thanks Justin  Hoboken  Hey Ope  How brilliant was his  Closing line last night  I just told you  I left early  That's probably why  He said that  Oh you think?  Yeah  I'm hoping  Sounds like a dick thing to say  Is he getting me?  You know what I was thinking though?  Like  I was thinking that  Kevin was going to  You know  Mention us 
[01:36:30]  During the Carnegie Hall thing  And I was so paranoid  Because it  And I'm not speaking  Out of turn here  Like you know  When we help  Help promote something  We get a little love back  Yeah  And I don't think he did  Which is fine  I'm not  I'm not saying that  But I'm like  I gotta leave early  And if all of a sudden  Kevin does the big  I want to thank  Oprah and Anthony  It points to where  We're supposed to be sitting  Empty seats  Oof  Mew  Were you  Oh boy  Let me ask you  Oh were you embarrassed  When you went to that movie premiere  To see the movie  And you waved 
[01:37:00]  Because you thought  That's one of my favorite stories  It just makes me laugh  It was so humbling  Because you're just honest about  How embarrassed  Oh anyone else  Just about every other  Guy in radio  Would never admit that  But it was the  Semi pro  Semi pro  Fucking  What was it  Screening  It was a  Times Square theater  Ant and I were forced to do it  By that  That dopey  Station we used to work for  And 
[01:37:30]  We show up  Late  Because we want to make  A little rock star entrance  And all of a sudden  We walk in  Everyone is standing  With their arms in the air  And I literally gave them the  Hey what's up  Like  Thanks for acknowledging us  What are you doing there  This is my greeting  Well I'm in the middle of telling the  Fucking semi pro story  So I had to record a greeting  We could do that during the break  Yeah I'm good  And 
[01:38:00]  The only reason I'm messing  Is because Jimmy brought it up  So  Ant and I walk in  And there seems to be a frenzy  Because we have arrived  I waved  To acknowledge the frenzy  And then I realized  They were all up standing  Because  They were  Getting free stuff  That was thrown at them  And that is a true story  But what I love about it  And  And there was probably  Two people there to see us  I have no problem admitting that  That's just  It was all black people  That looked like they were homeless  I'm signing up for a say now 
[01:38:30]  It's fun  There  Twitter integration  I'm done  You can block people  This rules  You don't care what I have to say  I was listening  I understand  By the way  On my phone  I have  My girlfriend's favorite story  Yeah  Is  Remember I told you  That Open Florentine  Showed me that guy  That we were at  The Comedy Central thing  And they're like  That's the  Because I was getting  I got a picture 
[01:39:00]  With Kiefer Sutherland  That night  Whoa whoa whoa  Whoa  That was my bit  Florentine was in my world  That day  Oh okay  And you pointed  And we saw this black guy  Me and Florentine  Worked together  I  It was my idea  Florentine pulled it off  Flawlessly my friend  Oh because  Get his picture  I'm like who is that  He says that's an actor  He's like  He's a new big action star  So this guy was talking  To two chicks  And I interrupted him  I'm like can I get a picture  With you  And he's like uh  Okay  And I hand open  The camera  And I'm standing  With the guy  And as  We look 
[01:39:30]  I realize  Him and Florentine  Are howling  And I realize  This is a fucking  A nobody  This is the guy  This is the picture  And you can see me laughing  Because I realize  I have just been  Fucking humiliated  Look at that black dude  I gotta figure out a way  To block this guy's face  And send out the picture  Because he might just  Be a civilian  You can just put some  Pixels over his eyeballs  And he'll be fine  A lot of credit goes  To Florentine  Because I started the bit  And Jimmy was like  Looking back and forth  To the guy and us 
[01:40:00]  And we're like no really  It's that show  And Florentine's looking at me  I'm like yeah  What the fuck  That show  It's big  I can't think of the name  It's like some kind of  Crime drama show  And Jimmy's like CSI  I'm like no not CSI  Something like that though  And oh I forgot  But trust me  He is on his way  He's the hot new guy  And something we said  Convinced Jimmy  And he ran over there  And then he's just  Tugging on the guy  Tugging  Tugging  Sir can I have a picture  Oh that is embarrassing  Dude I cock blocked him  He was talking to two chicks  And I cock blocked him  That is so embarrassing

[01:41:00]  And then pointed to his wife  And that's the pussy  I go to  Oh that's a great line  I hope he didn't bring them up there  And have them  And actually show the vaginas  That'd make Kevin my hero  If it was my mom  I'd have to say  That's the pussy  I slid out of  Because she was too drugged up  To take the pain  Then I had to crawl up  To her lifeless boo  Because she was still passed out  Oh no  To suck a little  To get some nourishment  Love me  Love me  Love me  Did you want nourishment?

Weed in everything  Everything Joe has is weed in it  I got a bottle of pot soda in front of me right now  I don't doubt it  Oh it's for real  It's not  You can get breath drips  Yeah pharmaceutical pot places sell everything with pot in it  It's not just weed  You can buy fucking soda cookies  It's so crazy  There's 500 medical marijuana dispensaries in Southern California alone right now 
[02:01:00]  Yeah see  It's insane  You drive down the street  You see neon weed signs  You would think it's a scene in a movie  You would think there's no way this could be real  Well Joe you know what they're doing  They're setting up to legalize this stuff  Yeah they are  They're realizing that  You know what  For the longest time  They could keep studies away from people  And people  You know  Oh I heard it does this to you  But now that you have the internet  Everybody has the facts in front of them  And slowly but slowly  The internet's full of facts  Wake up and go  If it doesn't get legalized with us 
[02:01:30]  What the fuck  I mean who is it going to get legalized with?  Yeah true  They're just trying it out right now  They're like alright let's see what this does  It's going to make them enough money  That it's not going to  You know like the situation that they're at right now  They're getting a lot of money  From pharmaceutical companies  And alcohol and tobacco companies  To keep making these commercials  These partnership for drug free America commercials  Yeah  That's who finances that stuff  You know these medical  They want to just make people think it's bad  These medical marijuana shops  I'm looking at a couple of pictures of them  Online over here  They're not quite your Rexall 
[02:02:00]  Or CVS pharmacy looking place  They're fucking head shops  Exactly  It looks like the red light district  It looks like you can get a Yankee Cranky in there too  That's not where you go to pick up like fucking Crestor  Or something  One of them that I went to  They have the cop that used to come there  Or rather the doctor that used to come there  You know like once or twice a month  And do prescriptions  Just basically go in and tell them I have a headache  When do you get headaches?  Whenever I think about the fact that POT's illegal 
[02:02:30]  Literally that's it  Alright here you go  I have lower back pain  Yeah  Looking at me like for sure I'm a cop  Like you know he's going to  Like they're very careful  Like you can tell they're worried about  Like DEA agents infiltrating them  Like the feds  How easy it is to get a prescription  Very easy  Yeah who do we have in?  Doug Benson was saying how easy it is right?  Oh yeah  Yeah he did that documentary  Super High Me  Yeah yeah right  And it's incredibly easy  Yeah I got a prescription for that  And it's not like you just go  People are like that's bad 
[02:03:00]  That's bad  But if you look at it on paper  It's way safer than alcohol  Way safer than tobacco  You want to watch  That's the best piece of evidence ever  That politicians are whores  Right  The fact that no one ever comes out  And says let's get rid of tobacco  It kills 400,000 people a year  If you're going to make something illegal  That I mean that's a bad thing  To profit on  But you never hear a peep out of them  That's because these tobacco companies  Sponsor these politicians  Joe I got to tell you something else  I've driven stoned  I've driven drunk 
[02:03:30]  And you know what is worse than both of those  And I mean fucking really bad  Driving exhausted tired  Tired right  You can't fucking do anything about it  I was driving home a few times  Where I'm like  I am falling asleep  And physically  There's nothing I can do about it  If you're drunk  And you have like  You're over the legal limit  But I'm not talking fucking  You know  You'll be blown off the scale over there  But  Hey there goes my V8  But  It's like 
[02:04:00]  If you're  You're legally drunk  And you're driving  You could actually  Put yourself in a mindset  Where you're like  I'm going to drive slow  I'm staying in the right lane  I'm using my blinkers  I'm doing everything I need to do  If you're stoned  You're just fucking  You're silly  But  You have your senses  About you  Yeah  Tired  You are in and out of lanes  You're  You're fixated  On a  A blank stare  At a retaining wall  That you're heading toward  Yeah  There's nothing you can do about that  The best thing 
[02:04:30]  If you  If anybody  This is the best advice  Anybody ever gave me  Because I used to do a lot of  Late night gigs  And I'd be working during the day  And I'd do gigs at night  I was always driving tired  A friend of mine told me  To bring cold water  In a bottle  In a  In a  In a washcloth  Wet the washcloth  In cold water  And just  Splash it all over your face  It wakes you up  It's the best move  I used to slap myself  I was just going to say that  I smacked myself in the face  Real fucking hard  And yelled  Yeah  Wake the fuck up  But that's only good  For like a couple minutes  Just 
[02:05:00]  If that  If that  I used to stick my head  Out the window  Like a  Like a great dame  Yeah  Like a dog  Yeah  Yeah  That's one of the things  That people  People really don't  Admit to enough  Yeah  You're absolutely right  Yeah  I bet a lot more people  Fucking get into  Fatal accidents  Do it  Some kids I went to high school with did  Yeah  Kids I went to high school with  Kid fell asleep at the wheel  Ran right into an embankment  And that was it  Bye bye  That was it  Yep  Everybody died  Hey Joe  You've been on for 10 minutes  We definitely want to make sure people know about Talking Monkeys in Space 
[02:05:30]  Good to know that you're still doing your drugs my friend  Premieres this Saturday at midnight on Spike TV  What's that about?  It's a comedy special  Stand up comedy special  The first one that Spike's done  And hopefully if this one goes well they're going to do some more  So you know it's perfect for guys like Bill or Jim or anybody  Spike is you know  Well they want to be the all guys network  Right  So and they also  They're owned by Comedy Central  So you know  The same company owns both of them  So my show is going to air on Spike 
[02:06:00]  And it's also going to air on Comedy Central  So it's a nice little cross promotion thing  I got the DVD yesterday  And I went to see Kevin Smith last night  But I wanted to pop the freaking DVD in  Before you got on the air today  I can't wait to check it out  Well thank you man  It's my favorite thing that I've ever done so far  And Joe  Let me get away with a lot  I'm very close to floating  Are you really?  What do you mean close?  Do it  Well I call this one place in New York  And they won't get back to me  You don't got money 
[02:06:30]  You should get one made  I ain't getting one made until I check it out  And then make sure it's for me  Just fucking do it  Trust me  Just do it man  Just hire someone to do it  Dude the same thing happened to me  I read Joe's whole thing when he was giving his  In his first tank away  And I was like  You know what I'm going to try this shit  And I called up the lady  And she didn't end up getting back to me  Then by the time she did  I didn't care anymore  But after I read Joe's blog  I was totally into it  Is that what it is?  What?  Sensory deprivation?  Yeah  Well it has a ton of salt in it 
[02:07:00]  So you just float there  Oh okay  And then they put the cover down  And you got a little music if you want  Or some laser lights if you want  Or just nothing  I'm going to go with nothingness  When I was in the show  Yeah yeah  Back to the womb  Right back in the womb  I'll tell you what I have done  I went into a sleep machine  When I go to Huntington  I go into a sleep machine  For like 15-20 minutes  It's amazing  What is it?  Is that the meeting we went into yesterday  With our bosses?  He's right there  Fucking A  Sleep machine  There he is  Coming up the hall  Perfect timing Anthony 
[02:07:30]  Insert foot in mouth  Oops  What is the sleep machine?  How does that work?  Sleep machine  You do a little of that new age music  They warm it up nice for you  A little fan on your face  And a light show  Huh  And the light show  Like puts you out  For about 15 or 20 minutes  Like a power nap or something?  It's a power nap  And you feel relaxed  I don't know if I actually slept  But it definitely  Got something in sync  A caller just fucking hung up  That said he was falling asleep  Riding his motorcycle  Oh my god  That has got to be 
[02:08:00]  Fucking hard to do man  Wow  Oh my god  Oh wow  Isn't that a weird thing  That we just get hypnotized  By the road  Cause that's the only time  When I  If I was like working  Like if you're out  Digging ditches  You know  Until the wee hours  Of the morning  You don't think about  Falling asleep  No you're not falling asleep  Doing that right  The road hypnotizes you somehow  Yeah  It's just weird  It's the whole thing  The hum of the wheels  The fucking  The warm air in your face  Yeah that motion  That's just kind of  Whizzing past you  Your peripheral vision  Like everything contributes 
[02:08:30]  To you just  Falling the fucking sleep  And sometimes  Nobody talks about it  Sometimes it's a time machine  I mean my favorite is  Holy shit  How the fuck  Did I get here  I have no recollection  Of that past 10 miles  I was  I was  I was  Text messaging my girl  For the last half hour  Now I'm home  And I'm at my desk  How did I get here  And you were driving  Autopilot  Oh I love that  That is fucked up man  There's a  There's a floating machine  That's a floating machine  Come on Bill  Me and you  Not in the same tank  Yeah in the same tank  Yeah well hold hands 
[02:09:00]  Make sure you have  A gentleman's agreement  That nobody pees  I looked up a place in New York  And I called them  A couple times  They must be out of business  Because they won't call back  Well they're probably  Run by hippies  You know  They're probably people  That are really bad  At getting back to you  It's an amazing experience  That looks gross  It's one of those things  Where they should be  Teaching people in school  They should be doing it in college  Like showing them  How to float  And how to get deeper  Into your head naturally  There's a lot of people  That are worried  About taking drugs  Like they would like  To try mushrooms  But it's scary  And for good reason 
[02:09:30]  You know  You don't even know  Who the fuck grew it  Where  And what is it going to do to me  How long is it going to last  The beauty of the isolation tank  Is you have a naturally occurring  Psychedelic experience  And anytime you want to end it  You just step out of the tank  So you don't have to worry about  Coming down  You own one of these  Yeah he does  Yeah he talks about this  On the show  Yeah I have a special one  That's made  It's designed  Joe the way you just explained that  It sounded the same way  Like when you get pulled under  By like a riptide  Oh just figure which way it's going 
[02:10:00]  And then just sort of  Gently just swim sideways  Yeah you're supposed to swim sideways  Like nobody freaks out  In those tanks  You know what  Open it up  Is that what you do  At a riptide  You swim sideways  Dude I gotta jump in again  Bill is absolutely right  You hear about riptides  Your entire life  I consider myself  A pretty good swimmer  I was in the Outer Banks  Two summers ago  I got in a riptide  And I was close to  Like losing control  I was trying to stay alive  For as long as I could  I see the people on the beach  Just having a good old time 
[02:10:30]  They got the music cranked  They're drinking Coronas  And I'm like  This is how I'm going to die  They don't even know  That I'm in deep trouble here  You guys know Greg Fitzsimmons?  Yes  He just saved someone  Really?  He saved someone  He was on vacation  He was on vacation  I can't remember where  Oh Costa Rica  And someone got caught in a tide  And pulled out  This girl was screaming  She was going under  Greg went out there  Like a superhero  Dove in the water  Swam out to this chick  Got her in a fireman's carrier  I guess  Or whatever you do  You put them on their back  And he swam with this lady to shore 
[02:11:00]  In the tide  Wow  Risked his own life  With his family there watching  Well that's  Yeah  Well because they tell you  Like Bill said  You're supposed to go out  With the tide  And then it calms down  But now you're way over your head  And you're way out there  And then you  Then you swim  Parallel to the beach  And then swim back in  Yeah  But all that knowledge  Goes out of your head  And you're just swimming  For dear life  That's this thing  You're supposed to just  Sort of relax  And be like  Alright I'm getting  Yanked this way  Reality is you're like  I'll end up in the middle of the ocean  It's like  Sucking in ocean water 
[02:11:30]  Like if you ever like  Start working out again  When you haven't worked out  In a long time  And your first workout  Is really hard  Like you're on a treadmill  And you're like  Man I just want to quit right now  Imagine that horrible feeling  When you are  300 yards from shore  Yeah oh my god  I can't  I can't do it anymore  And you're like  You've got to give up  I've got to just give up now  Oh that's scary  Oh man  No I don't  That's why  I don't fuck with the ocean  At all  Don't fuck with the ocean  I was in one man  Monsters in there 
[02:12:00]  Wow  That's my point  You and I have  The exact same opinion  On that  I heard you talking  And you actually said  Something that I say  On stage all the time  About tigers  You were talking about crocodiles  They're monsters  They are real  Real live monsters  The only reason  They're not considered  Monsters and stuff like that  Is because they're around  Yeah what I say  About tigers  Is that if tigers  Landed here  On a spaceship  From another planet  We'd want to kill them all  Yeah that's right  Nobody would tolerate  This new thing  That comes along  That loves to kill people  Exactly  That's great 
[02:12:30]  There's a place in India  Called the Sundarbans  And over the last  200 years  Tigers have killed  300,000 people there  Come on  There used to be  A lot of fucking tigers  I had to pause the TV  I had to rewind it  Play it back  And then immediately  Go to Google  It's true  Over the last  200 years  They have at least  300,000 deaths  Yeah  I wouldn't doubt it  That's a little over  1,000 a year ago  The problem is  These people  They live in these  Huts and villages  And the monsoons come  And a lot of them drown  They get taken away 
[02:13:00]  By the river  So like sometimes  When a bad monsoon  There'll be like  A bunch of bodies  In the water  Well the tigers  Developed a taste  For human flesh  So they like to eat people  Yeah  And then  God that's sick  And then they search out  The fresh ones  It's a terrifying situation  I tell a joke in my act  A story about this  One tiger that killed  Three guys on a boat  Swam out to the fucking boat  Oh shit  Killed the guy  Swam with his body  Back to the shore  Dropped it off at the shore  Hopped back in the water 
[02:13:30]  They swim faster than  Five guys can row  A fucking boat  Think about that  Oh my god  Think about how horrifying  That is  That's some scary shit  How do you allow it  To get on the boat though  You'd be kicking  The shit out of it  Dude those things  Weigh like 600 pounds  They're ridiculous big  Yeah  Do you know  If there were  Tyrannosaurus Rexes  Walking around now  There would be people like  We have to save the T-Rex  They're endangered  And they would be  They're monsters 
[02:14:00]  Exactly  But if they were  Walking around  They're part of nature  They wouldn't be  Walking around Manhattan  Or something  But they'd be in Africa  Somewhere  They're part of nature  Yeah  There's mountain lions  In my neighborhood  Yeah  A woman who lives  Down the block from me  Last year  Her dog got eaten  By a mountain lion  Jesus  And the people that  We live in the neighborhood  They go  Well you have to think  They were here first  Like what if  What the fuck  Are you talking about  What if it was a goblin  If a goblin  Hopped over this lady's fence  And killed the dog  Wouldn't we have a 
[02:14:30]  Fucking search party  For that thing  Wouldn't there be people  With torches and guns  I like how the  They were here first  Thing works for mountain lions  But American Indians  We just go  Fuck you  I don't look at it that way  I look at it more like  As far as like  The world population  That that mountain lion  Did a very green thing  Yeah he's calling  The fucking  Yeah  Human race  Too many humans  Too many humans  It needs to be culled  He's sitting in Times Square  So speaking of monsters  In the water  Do you scuba dive  No no no no 
[02:15:00]  I don't fuck with it  I don't fuck with the ocean  That guy in San Diego  I don't even get  In the water anymore  Ever since that swimmer  The guy  An old guy  Swimming  He practices triathlons  He got cut in half  By a 16 foot great white  Oh  Wow  Yeah  Yeah a bunch of people  Watching too  Swallowed him whole  One of the  One of the beach boys  Drowned  Yeah  You know the fucking  Beach boys  They even die  I'm not engaging  In anything  Where  I can't even remember  Like bring food with me  When I go somewhere  I'm not engaging  In any activity  Where I have to bring  My own air 
[02:15:30]  Diving  Like I gotta  Hey  Did you bring your air  You got your air  No air  Like I could go  Without water  Or food for a little while  Air  Now you're pretty fucked  Within like  A minute  I'm surprised  Rogan's not into it  With all the floating  And all that other stuff  You do  Diving  I don't wanna fuck  With that world  I can't live in that world  Dude it's in a whole  Another world  I got  Two planet earths here  No I gotta defend  The divers out there  Diving is amazing  I would do that  Every vacation if I could  Yeah muff  Wow  And if you're lucky enough 
[02:16:00]  To see a shark  Cause most diving  Lucky  Yeah most people are like  You know the diving instructors  Like hopefully we'll see a shark  We saw one this morning  When we brought people out here  He's just bragging  Trying to sound cool  I've never seen a shark  I'm not gonna play that game  But they say  When you see a shark  They fucking freak out  And they're gone man  They don't want anything  To do with you  It might be all that weird shit  People always try that  It's true though  I used to do a bit my act  I used to do a bit my act  With someone who was going  Trying to make me feel better  About scuba diving  Going you know what  Actually 90% of shark attacks  Actually happen in shallow water 
[02:16:30]  And the joke was like  Yeah no shit  That's where the people are  That's where people are  It's called the beach  Yeah  It's like there's people  Fucking swimming to Europe  90% of the people  Are in shallow water  Yeah  At the beach  So of course  Of course  But that little meal  That's out in the middle of the ocean  With a scuba tank on  That's a treat for a shark  Hey look at what just  All those people that talk about  How it's oh  It's very unlikely  That you're going to get bitten  It's impossible to get bitten  On the shore  Right  That's all I know  I have never seen a shark attack 
[02:17:00]  With somebody just hanging out  In like Oklahoma  Here's another  More dangerous on the shore  My friends  More dangerous on the shore  It might be more dangerous  You know they've had  Water  Like what's it called  Bull shark attacks  In fresh water  Like up to 100 miles  From the ocean  Jeez  Yeah they've had  They've spotted bull sharks  Which are like  Really aggressive ones  They're responsible  For killing a bunch of people  In New Jersey  There's a famous story  That they talked about  In Jaws  You remember 
[02:17:30]  There's a story  And it was a river  In Jersey  Oh right  Yeah  In the 1900s  Fresh water  These two people  Got killed by sharks  Yeah swim up  Like a couple of days  Swim up the river  Like Joe said  About 100 miles  And yeah  Ended up killing some people  Dude what about those  Those like three NFL players  Or whatever  They go out on that  Let's go fishing  Oh yeah  Next thing you know  The thing capsizes  And three of them  Drift off  I have what happened  They came up so fast  I don't get the CNN interview  They were fighting  For that one spot  On the top of the boat  It's obvious  The one guy that was rescued 
[02:18:00]  It was one spot for him  And that was it  That thing went over  Everyone was like  Fuck I'm in trouble  I can't survive out here  And they fought for that spot  I'm telling you  Wow you think so  I have no doubt  Out of my mind  Oh my god  That's terrifying  There was one  They were all friends  But they were out there  Knowing they're in deep trouble  They know that the water  Is too cold to survive  They had to get on top  Of that boat  And they fought for that spot  And I can't believe  Oh my god  No one has  Has taken that theory  And ran with it  Oh my god 
[02:18:30]  I think you might be right  That's terrifying  And they were all friends  Can you imagine  Fighting your friend  Yeah  Fighting your friend  For the best spot  Because when they found him  He's sitting up there  All nice  Right  And there was no other spots  Available up there  That's like Kirk and Spock  Going out on Vulcan  When I'm up time  How creepy would it be  If he wrote a book  Thank you  Because if you've ever been  In the ocean  And jump overboard  You're pretty much  Floating with the boat  At first  So it wasn't  Far-fetched to say  That these guys  Were around the boat  For the most part 
[02:19:00]  Wow  Okay  And if the boat's  Drifting away from you  You're certainly going to  Start swimming toward the boat  And now you're in a panic  And like holy fuck  I gotta get up on top  I'm telling you  There's other things  There's also  Were you drinking  Yeah  You know  Maybe that's a  Little bit of a  Dude that's when  You're really hating it  You suck down  All those natural lights  Well also  These are football players  Right  Football players  Are big guys  And one of the things  You have to realize  About big guys  Is it takes a lot more blood  To pump oxygen  Through all that muscle 
[02:19:30]  Right  Those guys get tired  Way easier  One of the things  We had  When we had on  Fear Factor  We had a contest  Where you were  Hanging from something  Like grabbing it  By your hand  And see  You know  Like you  Against a woman  See who could  Hang on the longest  Women almost always won  Hmm  You would think  Hand strength  That guys  But no  You're supporting  Your whole body  And your body  Ways more  And it takes up  More oxygen  Yeah  Damn  Yeah  Joe knows a little bit  About everything  What do you think  Of that fucking  UFC Undisputed game 
[02:20:00]  It's pretty bad  Isn't that thing  Fucking great  I love it  Even Ant likes it  Career mode  And I was never  Into fighting games  Or anything  But god damn  That one just looks  And the gameplay  Is great  I have a real hard  Time with video games  I'm actually scared  Of them  The way people  Are scared of drugs  I'm scared of them  I get badly addicted  Where I lose my whole day  I'll play like 8-10 hours  In a day  Every day  And I'll be obsessed  It's the ones  Where you have to  Do repetitive things  To level up  That gets addicting  Because you sit there  And even Travis 
[02:20:30]  Was talking about this  The other day  I guess with Tiger Woods  Golf or something  You get to one level  And you go  Okay  I'm gonna finish this one  And you look at the clock  And you're like  Alright  I gotta get to bed  And then you finish that level  And you leveled up  A little more  And you're like  Well now I wanna see  How good I am  That I got a little better  So I'll start another one  And then you finish that  And video game time  Is a whole different time  Than like work time  Oh yeah  Work time takes forever  Video game time  Is close to sex time 
[02:21:00]  Where it's like  Wow  Fuck  That time is flying by  Yeah  It's pretty crazy  I used to play  Quake online  Oh shit  Yeah  I got addicted  I was playing  I was playing so much  That I had a T1 line  Installed in my house  I couldn't get anything  Other than ISDN  And my ping times  Weren't low enough  Right  So I had a T1 line  Installed in my house  Just so I could play quick  I play 8-10 hours a day  Oh it was crazy  I was on the same way  With that faggy  Fucking EverQuest game  When it first came out 
[02:21:30]  Oh that'll kill you  And yeah  The leveling up  It's the whole thing  With leveling  I gotta get another level  I need more experience  Wow I gotta do this  I gotta  And then before you know it  Like you said  10-12 hours goes by  You're sitting in your own  Fucking filth  Hemorrhoids are fucking  In your hemorrhoid chair  I have a friend  Who used to be the manager  For the comedy store  And he was  He had a real problem  With it  And to put to the point  Where the guy  Never left his house  He would play  12 hours a day  Went broke  Lost his job  And I was talking about it 
[02:22:00]  And he goes  It's so weird  He goes  I'm so good  At making money  In the fake world  I'm so bad  At making it  In the real world  Yeah  Fake virtual world  Yeah  He was a bad motherfucker  He didn't want to leave  That world  Ben Stein's  He was a wizard  Ben Stein's son  Was addicted  He actually took him  To rehab  Yep  Because the kid  Would not stop playing  He'd wake up  In the middle of the night  And there was this kid  Just going out  On the computer  And playing  He goes  You know  You've got a problem  My brother's roommate 
[02:22:30]  Gave up on the regular world  And he lives  In the virtual world  I forgot what game  The last I checked in  He was doing Tribes  There's a lot of people  Out there doing that  But you know what  I don't see anything wrong  With it  Because the virtual world  Seems to be  A much cooler place  To live sometimes  It's better than the real world  Sometimes  It's a lot more fun  I'm serious  Like you're  You're like a bum  Going nowhere in life  That was hilarious  That sounded like  Some Hollywood movie  I just didn't like  The real world  I feel safer here 
[02:23:00]  I don't really see  A problem working  In the Matrix  Yeah  The Matrix  Right  I think you're right  You could do some cool shit  In the virtual world  You certainly can  We don't care about people  That hate their fucking jobs  And work in something  That sucks all day  And get home  And just take a break  Rest up  And then go back  And do it again  You know  These people all need  To fucking grow up  But when you go  When you're playing  I'm playing Pac-Man at 50  What the fuck is wrong  With you  That's fun  What's wrong with you  My brother's  My brother's roommate  Does  At least  You're a weapon crafter 
[02:23:30]  In EverQuest  You're the king shit  You're not working  No dude  I got brick breaker  On my phone  Love the brick breaker  I can't keep my phone charged  Anytime I got two seconds  I'm driving a rental car  I'm playing it  We are so distracted  That's my elevator game  I do a quick level  As I go up  To my apartment  In the elevator  But my brother's roommate  12 hours a day  Easy  Actually probably more than that  Has a job  And then if he does  Leave the house on weekends  He unplugs his computer  And does the land parties 
[02:24:00]  Land parties  Oh my god  Wow  He does nothing  But work to pay bills  And play his game  That is it  I'm really lucky  That they weren't around  When I was in high school  I would have had  A real problem with them  But back when I was in high school  The games were terrible  It was like Pong  You know  It was just horrible  We were talking about  That Atari basketball game  Where it was like  Dunka dunka dunka  Yeah  Exactly  Scored every time  With like the horrible graphics  It was just this big ring  On a stick 
[02:24:30]  Yeah  Not even a ring  Look at the old graphics  I went looking at the old graphics  It's a half a tee  Five pixels make up the guy  Half a cross  One giant pixel is the ball  That just goes  Blum blum blum blum  Crazy huh  I used to love that game  I thought it was the bomb  It was the bomb back then  But the stuff they have now  Is just too powerful  Yeah  Really good shit man  The video games  The graphics are fucking insane  I know  I'm so into them  They're so good  It's just unbelievable  Yeah  That's what I was saying  Every time the guys kick  I mean it almost looks like 
[02:25:00]  For a second  Like they're really fighting  Like it's really them  Yeah they really went to town  On that game  And made it look  So realistic  These guys  The moves they do  When they fall down  They get knocked the fuck out  It's fantastic man  Yeah we did  We did a lot of time  Doing the commentary  On that thing too  To make it like  It was like real fights  That's awesome  Yeah  You know  Speaking of UFC  Who did we have in recently  Who was amazing  He was an amazing guest  Oh shit  Oh Forrest  Yeah Forrest  Of course  Oh Forrest Griffin's awesome 
[02:25:30]  He's out of his fucking mind  We love him  Dude I thought  He's a character man  Yeah  He's like right out of a novel  I thought Chuck Liddell  And the rest of them  Were out of their mind  But I think he's the one that  I mean I wouldn't fuck  With any of them obviously  Right right right  But he looks like  He's a problem  He is a problem  Right  Yeah and he's quite a character  Yeah yeah  He's a guy who really enjoys it  We love him  You try to talk to some of these guys  About style and technique  And everything  And he goes  I just go in there and fight  Yeah  He goes that's all I did  I grew up  I was getting into fights  I figured I'd do this  And just fucking fight  We loved the guy 
[02:26:00]  Oh okay  He was great  He's just a fucking problem  Yeah he's got a big tough  A big tough fight coming up  He's fighting Anderson Silva  In August  Wow yeah  That's a biggie  Anderson is an assassin  That guy's like  My friend always says  He's like a real live Matrix guy  Yeah  He really does  He moves like he's in the Matrix  Like everybody's in a different dimension  He's running on the side of the ring  Yeah  It's just  He's incredible  And then we finally  We finally had Fedor in  Oh wow  And with his Russian translator  Yeah I 
[02:26:30]  That guy's  A very special athlete man  You know  It really sucks  That we can't get him  Into the UFC  Yeah I'm sure  Dane is always trying  Yeah I know  They're always trying  But apparently  You know  They can't work out  The business end of it  Ridiculous  But you know  That's how it goes right  Too bad  Because he's  He's pretty spectacular  Yeah  Did you guys see the video  Of Ray Mercer  Knocking out Tim Sylvia  In 10 seconds  Hell no  Oh fuck  You haven't seen that  Oh my god  Tim Sylvia  Former UFC heavyweight champion  Took a boxing match  With Ray Mercer  And it turned into 
[02:27:00]  An MMA match  They couldn't get  Sanctions as a boxing match  Ray Mercer  Knocked him out  With one punch  In like 9 or 10 seconds  Wow  It's on the internet  I mean out cold  Damn  Can you go to show you man  Even though he's 48 years old  They say the power  Is the last thing  That leaves you  And the hand skills  Of a professional boxer  Are so much better  Than the hand skills  Of the average  Mixed martial artist  You can't get as good  With your hands  As they have  Because they're doing  Just that  They're only training that  And they're doing it  From the time they're young 
[02:27:30]  And now you know  You're just jumping in  After a couple of years  You think you're going to  Be able to hang with them  Like there's no way  You might hang with them  In an MMA fight  Because you could take them  Down and strangle them  But a guy like Ray Mercer  You can't mess with a dude  Like that  Even though he's 48 years old  He'll knock you the fuck out  And that's what he did  With Tim Sylvia  One punch  Yeah  Yeah we're looking it up  For now  Now we gotta check it out  Oh it's fucking crazy  Wait till you watch it  And it was supposed to be  A boxing match  And like I said  With two days notice  They turned into an MMA match  And Tim Sylvia kicked 
[02:28:00]  Ray Mercer in the leg  And you could tell  Ray Mercer was like  What the fuck  He don't play  We're taking it out here  Here's the second Joe  Oh my god  God damn  God damn  Did he fucking go down  And that was it  One punch  Wow  Leveled up  Because boxing gloves  Are you know  8 and 10 ounces  Those little gloves  In MMA are only 4  Wow  They're tiny little gloves  A guy like Ray Mercer 
[02:28:30]  Hits you with that  You got fucking problems  He was fucking  Out on his feet  Knocked the fuck out  On his feet  People are starting to realize  That the type of striking  That you use in MMA  Is different  Because of those little gloves  Yeah  You know  You can do much more damage  When you really see it  Is like when a guy like Mercer  Who's a real great boxer  Right right  It's not those big padded  Fucking gloves  That had to hurt  Yeah  He hit him right on the chin  Oh damn  Did he go down  You got fucking problems 
[02:29:00]  No kidding  Hey  Did you read about Shaq yesterday?  Yeah he wants to fight  Hongman Choi  Is that real  Or is he just fucking around?  I don't know man  Jose Canseco just fought him  Yeah well  Maybe Shaq  He could beat him  I can't  Let me tell you something  I met that dude  A bunch of times  He goes to the UFC  All the time  Apparently he trains  Like crazy  He loves jiu jitsu  And kickboxing  And he's fucking huge  Yeah  Yeah  But he's huge  In a different way  Than Hongman Choi is  Hongman Choi is  Gigantitis 
[02:29:30]  Like or whatever  The disease is  Where he had a tumor  On his pituitary gland  And that's why  I mean he's a  Literally  He's a guy  That had a problem  Shaquille O'Neal  Is just a fucking  Giant human  He's in proportion  Is what  Yeah  Because some of these  Really tall guys  They're not in proportion  I saw Shaq  I was on vacation  At a place  And Shaq was staying  At the same place  It's amazing  How big that guy is  You don't really  Appreciate it  Because when you  Watch an NBA game  Most of the guys  Are way bigger 
[02:30:00]  Than normal  So you don't really  See the comparison  Next to a regular  Human being  It's unbelievable  And he's big  Compared to those guys  Oh yeah  Of course  A giant super athlete  Canseco running  Around that ring  Getting beat up  How weird was that  It was so  It's like  Oh my god  He's running away  How am I missing  All this stuff  When did  Jose Canseco fought  And he fought  For K-1  Yep  Or was it Dream  Maybe it was Dream  It was one of the  Jazz organizations  But he's  How sad is it  To see a guy  Who was at the top 
[02:30:30]  Of the heap  In the sports world  Yeah  He was a superstar  He was like  You know like  People talk about  A-Rod today  That's how they used  To talk about  Jose Canseco  Yep  And there he was  Just kind of getting hit  And going like  Uh oh  I don't want to get hit no more  Let me just kind of  Well that guy  Back off from this guy  That guy  That giant guy  I can't pronounce his name  Like Joe can  But he's like  Seven what  Six  Yeah  Something along those lines  Hongman Choi  Hongman Choi  And Shaq wants to fight him  For real  You know what  I'm telling you  Shaq is so big 
[02:31:00]  And so powerful  And so fast  Hongman Choi  Is just getting by  Basically on the fact  That he's a giant dude  Nothing he does  Looks spectacular  But Shaquille O'Neal  Is a super actor  Yeah just  Giant monster  If he was really  Training hard  At kickboxing  And jiu jitsu  I think he would  Probably fuck up  A lot of people  Wow  I would love to see that  There's a lot of guys  Like where you see them  They just joined the gym  Like in jiu jitsu  They'll  You know  They'll have been  Like track and field  Athletes or something  Their whole life  And they just joined the gym 
[02:31:30]  And like within  Like a couple of months  You can't tap them out anymore  Just because they're so big  And powerful  You know  There's guys  That are just so explosive  You get a hold of them  And it's like  They're just  They're like a different thing  Than you are  They throw you off  No shit man  It's like  They're super athletes  Like you know  People that think  They're strong  Like you think you're strong  Until you roll  Like do jiu jitsu  With a guy  Who's really strong  And then you go  Oh my god  I'm like a little bitch  It's like  It's like strong  For strong guys  You know 
[02:32:00]  And a lot of these  Jiu jitsu guys  Are like that  Is George Brett  Fighting anybody  Coming up  Yeah  Jose's the first one  To fall  I wonder how many  Other guys  Are going to do  Stuff like that  They were supposed  To be doing  A mixed martial arts  Reality show  I think Mark Burnett  Was doing it  I think  That's what I heard  They were going to do  Jose Canseco  Versus  What's his name  Football player  That had the  Problems with  Split personality disorder  Oh fucking  Herschel  Herschel Walker 
[02:32:30]  Yeah  And he was supposed  To fight Canseco  But I don't know  If they're still  Going to do that  Now  Oh Herschel  Would kill him  I don't know  Herschel  He has trauma  Related mental  Problems  Even better  I saw him on  The Celebrity Apprentice  Yeah he's not right  Well with football  Injuries  You know  Like people don't  Think about it  But they're very  Similar to boxing  Or MMA injuries  Like you get brain  Damage  Yeah  Too many times  Yeah  Noggin gets hit  Yeah your brain  Starts bouncing around  Inside there  Speaking of brain  Damage we had  Joe Frazier in studio 
[02:33:00]  I was listening man  I was sad  Smoking Joe  I texted Jimmy  After it was over  I was like wow  That was hard to listen to  Well but he  He's happy  Because he  He sounds better  Than Ali  And he's obsessed  With just making  The world  Making the world  Know that he's  Better off than Ali  Could you imagine  A fucking feud  That burns  Inside your guts  For that long  Yeah  That can't be healthy  Oh my god  That's incredible  Like Ali's gonna die  And he's gonna start laughing  Yeah he'll piss on his grave  You gotta pick up 
[02:33:30]  He probably will piss on his grave  And he'll probably put it on YouTube  Oh yeah  You gotta pick up  Thrilla in Manila  It was a pretty good documentary  In the whole thing  Yeah I'm a huge boxing fan  So I watched that  That trilogy of fights  It was real interesting  Because Ali could beat Foreman  But  And Frazier could beat Ali  But there's no way  Anybody could  No way Frazier could ever  Fuck with Foreman  Foreman was just too big  He was an animal  He was one of those guys  That required technique to beat  Yep  If you just stood in front of him  And tried to bang it  You would lose every time  And on that day 
[02:34:00]  He came in  He took a guy like Ali  Came in and we shook his hand  Fucking Foreman's hands  Oh my god  It's not even real  It's like a fake movie prop  That he had on the end of his arm  Yeah  Giant fucking mitt  Like the thing from Fantastic Four  No it was cool  I shook Joe Frazier's hand  And I squeezed really hard  And I actually got him to go  Ow  Wow  Because his hands are  You know  That was probably  Arthritis  There's arthritis  So I was able to  Get an owl  When he fought Frazier 
[02:34:30]  He just  He punched him one time  And Frazier literally went up in the air  And landed on one knee  Like a cartoon  Yeah  He like genuflected  After he hit him  Yeah  He was a crazy power puncher man  And he won the title  At 46 years old  That's what people don't realize  When he made that big comeback  Yeah that's crazy  When he hadn't fought in 10 years  That's like a great American sports story  36 years old  The guy was rotund  He was so fucking fat  When he came back  No one gave him any chance  Yeah  And then slowly 
[02:35:00]  He starts trimming away his body  And he gets in fights  With tougher and tougher guys  And he knocks them  Fucking senseless  Like the second half of his career  Is one of the most  Spectacular sports stories ever  46 years old  Getting his ass kicked  By Michael Moore  Lands one right hand  And Moore is asleep  He had a great defense too  Do you remember that  He would just come out  And just cross his arms  In front of his body  Archie Moore style  He learned that from Archie Moore  Archie Moore was a very famous guy  Back in like  I think like the 50s 
[02:35:30]  I think is when he fought  Somebody could correct me  But I think it might have even  Been earlier than that  It might have been the 40s  Gentleman Jim Corbett  Was fighting  He was  Ali fought him  When Ali was really young  So I guess it was the 60s  And Archie Moore  Was famous for having  This weird style  We would cross his arms  In front of him  How'd he get a punch going  Unique  Well he would just swarm on you  And he was real good  At rolling with punches  He was a very crafty guy  Yeah  You know  Archie Moore was like  One of those guys  That fought like 200 times  So you had to like  Really learn how to protect yourself 
[02:36:00]  In order to fight like that  You know you couldn't just go  In there guns blazing  Ricky Hatton style  You'd never make it  200 fights  I miss the old school boxing  Remember like  A fight would happen  And the whole world would watch  Yeah  I remember I went to see  Hagler vs. Leonard  In a movie theater  Wow  Oh shit  Yeah  They used to show those  When they used to do that  Yeah  That was crazy  You'd buy tickets to a fight  And go to like  Nassau Coliseum  And the fight was in California  And they'd show it on those  Horrible screens  Yeah but what a great way  To see a fight  With everybody else  Oh it was amazing  You feel the energy 
[02:36:30]  Way better than watching it at home  If you watch it at home  That's pretty cool  But watching a fight  On the pay-per-view  At a movie theater  Where you get to hear  The commentary  And on top of that  You're around 15,000 other people  Yep  That's fucking awesome man  Yeah the times have changed  Those old days man  The Sugar Ray Leonard days  Yeah  Yeah  Roberto Duran  Tommy Hearns  You know  Roberto Duran  Yeah there's really no  Standout boxers  That are  Well UFC's  I think Manny Pacquiao  Manny Pacquiao stands out  You know  I think that guy's got 
[02:37:00]  The real potential  To be the next  After De La Hoya  Type superstar  It just doesn't have  That vibe though  Where people are like  Holy shit I gotta get this  On pay-per-view  You know  Well you know what  Like the old Tyson days  Where  I think inherently  It's just been eclipsed  By a crazier sport  Yeah absolutely  It has  That's really what it is  Yep  I love boxing still  I'm still a huge boxing fan  But the bottom line  Is MMA's more exciting  If I had to choose  Between watching a boxing match  Or an MMA match  I'm always gonna watch the MMA  Even watching  When you're watching boxing  You used to 
[02:37:30]  I remember watching  And I used to say  God that would be great  If you could just kick him  In the face  Wouldn't that be fantastic  And then someone said  Yeah let's do that  Let's make it so they can box  But this guy could kick him  In the face anytime  Or if he gets him on the ground  He could just put his elbow  Into his fucking nose  But that's what's great  About MMA  It's like  It has all the aspects  Of what could happen  In a real fight  Short of weapons  And somebody actually  Gouging your eye out  But yeah  You stand it up  And next thing you know  Your back's on the sidewalk  Then what do you do  I'm fucked  And now the guy's like  Over me  Just pummeling me  Those UFC guys 
[02:38:00]  Is like  They're just taking forearms  To the fucking head  And they look over  And see 30 seconds left  And they ride it out  How many elbows  To the head  Could you take  I take one  And I'm just like  Alright  Enough  Here's the keys to my car  Take my girlfriend  I'm done  Those guys ride it out  And then come back  And win the next round  There was a fight  This past weekend  Is Cain Velasquez  Versus Czech Kongo  Cain Velasquez  Is a badass wrestler  Took Czech Kongo down  Czech Kongo's  This gigantic kickboxer fellow 
[02:38:30]  He's another badass dude  Great great fight  Cain Velasquez  Takes this guy down  And in the last round  He punched him in the head  Over 110 times  Jesus  What the fuck  Just think about that  110 fucking punches  To the head  By a professional  Heavyweight  Mixed martial arts fighter  Who's sitting with his  Dick on your chest  Jesus  He's sitting like  Dick in your face  Punching you in the face  110 times  What the fuck  That's exactly  What the fuck 
[02:39:00]  You know how tough  You have to be  To ride that out  Not tap out  No I don't actually  Can't get the guy off him  He's trapped  Cannot get this guy off him  And he won't give up  And this guy's just  Punching him in the fucking face  How do you condition your head  That's what I  You can do like set ups  You know what I'm saying  The guy probably painted  Eyeballs on his eyelids  And he was knocked the fuck out  But it just looked like  He was staring at the guy  Hey Joe  This is something  I always was wondering  How come every time  Somebody gets knocked out  Right 
[02:39:30]  Their legs always end up  Getting crossed  You ever notice that  They always look like  They're just laying on the couch  Like wide receivers  Whenever a wide receiver  Gets lit up  They always land on their back  Their arms are like  They're stuck in the air  But their legs are always crossed  Like they're in a hammock  Well you know  If you just shut your body off  That's what would happen  So it's the weirdest feeling  In the world  To get your body shut off  I've never been knocked unconscious  But I've been dropped  I got dropped in a kickboxing match  This guy hit me with a left hook 
[02:40:00]  And literally my legs shut off  They just gave out  And all of a sudden I fell  Like they weren't under me anymore  And then when I tried to get back up  They were just like  They were made out of spaghetti  Wow  That is fucked up  Because that thing  He didn't punch you in the legs  That's what's fucked up about that  He punched me on the jaw  I shut my nervous system off  He punched you in the head  And fucked up your legs  Yeah  Fucked up everything  My whole nervous system  Yeah  I didn't know what was going on  I knew I was in a fight  God damn  I knew I couldn't walk  I couldn't stand up  I was like holy shit  I gotta get back to my feet 
[02:40:30]  He hit you in the part of the head  That controls your legs  Yeah  And you know what  I'm so retarded  I got up at the count of eight  And he beat on me some more  And then they stopped the fight  But the second one  It was more like  I just  My body just gave out  And I just collapsed  And he just punched me  Before that happened  But the big one  Was the one that dropped me  The first time  And I swear to god  It's the weirdest feeling  In the world  It's like  Somebody just hits a switch  In your back  And your legs don't work  You're a robot  Joe  Do you like getting hit?  No  No I don't do kickboxing anymore  For that very reason 
[02:41:00]  When I do jujitsu  You don't get hit  It's all grappling  When did you not like getting hit?  Because I remember being younger  And you know  You're in college  And drinking  And getting in fights  All the time  It was alright though  And then you get a little older  And you get hit in the face  And you're like  Wow that really fucking sucks  Well you know  The way I always looked at it  I never had a problem with it  Until when I was kickboxing  I started getting headaches  And I would get headaches  Where I would lie in bed at night  At the end of the night  And my head hurt  And I was like  My head's broken  Like I hurt my head today 
[02:41:30]  Right  Like it's bruised inside my head  Like it's not fucking good man  And I was really terrified  Because I knew a bunch of guys  Who had boxing careers  You know  Who were like low level  Professional boxers  And some of them  Had fucking brain damage  Like real serious brain damage  No shit yeah  You could tell they were  Struggling to try to talk  So I don't fuck with  Striking sports anymore  You know  If you're going to fight  For a living  I think it's mandatory  That you do it  But I don't  I take it very seriously  Getting hit in the head  It's not good for you  There was a time though 
[02:42:00]  You didn't really mind it  I mean no one  No one wants to get hit in the face  But you kind of just go  With like yeah whatever  And then one day  You get a shot  And you're like  Never again  Fuck that  I'm avoiding this  At all costs now  You can see  What happens in them  They get changed  As a lot of them do  When they get knocked out  Yeah you can see  Like they realize  Like how vulnerable they are  They realize that's possible  Some guys never recover from it  God bless you guys  I've got knocked out  Three times in my life  Really?  And it's always  A blow to the head  And you just see like 
[02:42:30]  You literally see stars  It just  It goes black  You just see this white  And your teeth  Always smash together  You hear that?  And then you're just  You're just on the ground  That high pitched  Fucking whine  Whee  I got knocked the fuck out once  I  Actually I  I was  On my ass  Sitting on the sidewalk  Not knowing what happened  And some guy was just  Laughing at me  And I'm bleeding  Out of my fucking eyebrow  Just fucking bleeding  Like a motherfucker  Going  Wow  I just got fucking  Sucker punched  So bad 
[02:43:00]  He was laughing?  He was laughing  It was this guy  Like we  It was during  I think I was in high school  Or junior high  Or some shit  And there was this guy  I was living out in California  This Mexican kid  And he used to hate me  And I didn't like him  But it was kind of a  We never really  It was an unspoken  Hatred thing  And he's like  Hey  Come here  Let's fucking  Slapbox a little here  And we were in front of  Like the thrifty  Drug and discount store there  And I was gonna get  A triple scoop cone  And um  Seagulls drinking out of puddles  Yeah  So he's like fucking 
[02:43:30]  So we start slapboxing a little  And he went in with a slap  And I kind of went back  And then when I came back forward  He had a fist waiting for me  Bam!  Bam!  Right in the fucking eye  And I went right down on my ass  Which hurt even more  Because like you said  My teeth just went  Crank  Oh yeah  Felt my spine  I think I got shorter  It was just  Wham!  Right on my ass  And I'm bleeding  And as I opened the one good eye  That was left  And it started like  The tunnel vision  Started stopping a little  I just were like  Motherfucker 
[02:44:00]  I wanted him dead for years  That's a mean fucking dude  Yeah he was a real prick  Big fat Mexican  That's a dude that knocks a guy out  And isn't scared afterwards  Like oh my god  What did I do?  No he loved seeing the blood  And seeing me on my ass  I know right  It's not like  Am I going to get sued?  Am I going to jail?  He didn't give a shit  That was the days when  You didn't worry about lawsuits  That's not good  It's not good  You got knocked out by  Jack Nicholson in the departed  He felt funny  Yeah  There was a time  You didn't worry about lawsuits  And all that crap  Yeah  Back in the good old days 
[02:44:30]  I just got knocked out  Over dumb shit  I remember it was a blizzard of 78  And we got snowed in  At the Blue Hill Regional School  So we were sleeping in the gym  And they had these ropes  Hanging from the ceiling  So me and my brother  Started swinging on them  And we're both facing each other  As we're going by  Like laughing  As we get closer and closer  Then that was that one  Faithful time  We both had a look of panic  We passed each other  Dude just like  Like two bells  And like the back of our heads  Just bam  Right off the ropes  Under those little  AMF pads 
[02:45:00]  Yeah  And then like  Assholes  I swear to god  Not even an hour later  We get back on them again  Oh my god  Same thing again  Of course  Both times  You got knocked out twice  I got knocked out three times  In my life  And twice  Within the same hour  That's real dangerous man  That's real dangerous  You did it again  You got knocked out  More than once in a day  Yeah really  My best knockout  Was because I called  My good friend  The n-word  Oh well  Really  Apparently not that good friend 
[02:45:30]  As you thought  No Joe  You called him  You called him a nigger  And he punched you in the head  And knocked you out  Yeah but see  That sounds really bad  So let me explain  Like I was part of the basketball culture  Growing up  And I had a lot of black friends  And I was playing a little pickup game  And Gary was on my team  And he sunk a fine three-pointer  And I pointed to him  And I said  Nice shot  No way  But you said  You were like nigger  No I went ER  But because ER was  The ER was way in back then  But Joe  I mean to defend myself 
[02:46:00]  They were using it among each other  So I figured I'm part of the black culture  So I could use it too  Listen  It's just a fucking word  What's important is intent  The problem is  You've given people  The ability  They use it this word  Like it's a magic ticket  To be able to punch you in the face  Anytime you want  I was complimenting my friend  And that's the truth  Of course  All you had to say was  My  And use the A  And have A  But you just  I gotta  You can't get away with even that  No I'm joking  I'm just joking  I got a chip tooth to this day  And I don't even think 
[02:46:30]  I got the full word out  Before I was out cold  On the basketball court  Wow  And what did he say  When he woke you up  We never talked again  What  He didn't apologize  Nothing  Hell fucking no  Oh my god  That's how I remember it  I don't think we ever talked again  That was obviously  The end of the game for me  Because I was like  You know  In la la land  It's alright  Because you're still white  How do you guys feel  About the word faggot  Because I keep hearing  This is the latest  That I keep hearing  That's the new N word  That's like  The same as saying nigger  It's like  For gay people 
[02:47:00]  Gay people can call themselves that  But you're not allowed to use that  I'm like  That's nonsense  We already have one  Fucked up word like that  Yeah  We don't need another  Fucked up crazy word  I think intent on that one  And context is all important  Because I've used the word  Faggot my whole life  As far as  Saying to friends  You know  You want to come out  What are you doing  Don't be a faggot  Grab your mitt  We're going to  Fucking play some ball  Or something  It had nothing to do with gay  Nothing to do with being gay  We're going to lose  I fight this  I fight this all the time  I'm like  This is silly  I got in a big argument  With a gay comic  About it in Boston 
[02:47:30]  I'm like  This is silly  It's intent  Is what's important  You can't have  Fucking another magic word  We've been saying  That our whole lives  Well we lost the N word  We lost  We're losing the F word  I'm not giving up retard  I'm not giving up  Fucking you're retarded  You can't give it up  No  You're not saying  You have a disease  You have down syndrome  Right  You're fucking retarded  You're just being a fucking retard  Is what you're doing  Joe you got to continue  Fighting the good fight  Because we're pretty much  Losing faggot  And fast forward two years  The list will be ridiculous  Of words we're not allowed to say 
[02:48:00]  That's how I feel  About the fanny pack as well  I'm bringing back fanny packs  And I'm bringing back faggot  And I don't understand  I mean  I don't understand  Where you're not allowed  To say a word  That other people  Are allowed to say  Yeah exactly  That's what this gay guy  Was saying  That's what  That makes sense  You know what it's like  It doesn't make sense  This is what it's like  There's consequences  If you use the word  No I'll tell you what  That's like  You can't kick the shit  Out of my little brother  But I can  Yeah  That's it  It's nuts  It's not nuts 
[02:48:30]  It's a magic word  I think it's nuts man  If a group of people  Are allowed to use the word  Why am I not allowed to use it  I mean if I'm going to use it  There's consequences  I could get the shit kicked out of me  Well why would you want to  I can't believe that  I just want  I just  For saying it as a friend  Bill to be honest  I probably wouldn't use the word  I just want  I want to be able to  Yeah well I do  A joke about how I use it  Only on stage  When I'm explaining  Like that it's  You know talking about the word 
[02:49:00]  That's the only time  I use it either on stage  Or when I know for sure  There's no black people around  Right  I only use it in my car  With the windows rolled up  After I've been  After I've been cut off  Look I don't think  You know that like  You know saying like  Faggot  You can't compare  You weren't like enslaved  And dragged here  From another country  There wasn't like that  Whole kind of thing  They don't show importance  To the word  Gays  Gays don't show importance  To the word  I think they're trying  To piggyback  On to  Sexy  Well they want to have  Their own special word 
[02:49:30]  Discriminated  Forget it  I love that Bill  I try  You know what  I got an hour and a half  Sleep last night  I give up  I give up  Brandon saying that  Two minutes ago  I said I was never  Knocked out  I think Joe Rogan  Was saying he was  Never knocked out  Yeah I said  I've never been  Unconscious  But I've been dropped  And if I said  I was never knocked out  That's a lie  Gary knocked  The fuck out of me  That's so fucked up  That that guy  Would think that  It's okay to do that  Just because you said  A word  Even though clearly 
[02:50:00]  Your intent wasn't  To insult him  Dude he's standing  Out there  There's other black guys  In the court  And he has to come off  Like he gave him  The permission  To call him that  I hate to  You're lucky  You didn't stomp  Your head after it  How ridiculous is that  Bill is absolutely right  He had to  He had to  I'm not happy about it  But now looking back  I'm like he had to  Yeah he had to  He had to save face  With his boys  But I thought  I thought I was in  Another time  I got knocked out  Another time  Another time  I got knocked out  I got run over  By a jeep 
[02:50:30]  Really  I was racing  My brother home  And he could always  Beat me  From a dead stop  So I was like  I know  I'll cross the street  As we're racing  And I swear to god  I thought I looked  And I drove right out  In front of this guy  And I got hit  Next thing I was  Upside down  Last thing I remember  Seeing was the bumper  And one of the front tires  Wow  I wish I had video  To see how I didn't  Get run over  Because I woke up  And I was laying  Right on the double  Yellow line  Like I was  I was knocked out  For like literally  Like whatever 
[02:51:00]  The amount of time  It took the guy  To pull over  Because I stood up  And ran to the sidewalk  And the biggest dude  You ever saw  Get out of this jeep  Crying like a baby  Because I was like  In second grade  And he was just like  Oh my god  I hit him  Oh yeah  I'll buy you a new bike  You know  That's your worst nightmare  Oh my god  If you're driving a car  Hitting a kid  Oh damn  That's your worst nightmare  It would be horrible  Horrible  You ever sprint  Across the street  Without looking  Yeah  What a great feeling  I almost had here once  When I was 20  What a great feeling 
[02:51:30]  Main street  25A  Ant knows where  I used to live  A very busy street  The ball would go  Across the street  The basketball mostly  And every once in a while  You would sprint  Without looking  I guess because you know  That you were running so fast  That the odds  That you would actually  Get hit  That's insanity  Fuck that  Holy shit  I remember as a kid  I did that a few times  For real  And what a great feeling  Oh man  When you get to the other side  Hey Bill  Let me ask you this  Bill 
[02:52:00]  When you were knocked out  You said you were knocked  Unconscious three times  Yeah  Did you feel different  After like the third time  Do you ever feel like  Like maybe you lost a step  No  I'm not saying you're retarded  No because it was literally like  They all happened like  Second grade  And then twice  In like the fifth grade  So your brain just recovers then  I think  But you are saying  That your memory's gone  A little bit  No no no  I'm just wondering  You know  Because I know  The question in MMA  Has always been  How many times  Can you get knocked out 
[02:52:30]  Where you can still  Safely compete  Alright well  I basically smashed heads  With my brother  Who was in first grade  Which you know  Is obviously not the same  As getting punched by  Chuck Lydell  Well it is for a first grader  Banging heads  Decent point  It's the worst feeling  Decent point  Heads banging together  Man it's scary  That clunking sound  That class  You know  What about the head  Dunk  On the asphalt  Yeah yeah  And when you play  With the Nerf football  And somebody go up  And you hear that  Classic coconut  Boom  Oh man  So bad  That makes people puke 
[02:53:00]  Not the person that falls  Like  What  If you guys are boxing fans  Nigel Benn fought  Gerald McClellan  And they clashed heads  This is like  In the 90's  Gerald McClellan  Was the  I think he was the  Super middleweight champion  At the time  Or maybe light heavyweight  They clashed heads  And Gerald McClellan  Started bleeding  Inside of his brain  Holy shit  Yeah  He sat down in his corner  TKO  He gave up  He went down to one knee  Sat down in his corner  And immediately blacked out  And they took him to the hospital  The guy had bleeding  In his fucking brain  He's never been the same sense 
[02:53:30]  And that was from a headbutt  Wow  God damn  They were both trying to  Hit each other  And they came in  And clashed heads  And one guy had a harder  Fucking head  Yeah apparently  Wow  It was a long  Drawn out boxing match  And the guy had lost  A lot of weight  So that makes you even  More vulnerable  When you see guys  Like cut weight  It makes you very vulnerable  To head trauma  Oh have you ever seen that  Looking to watch like  Boxing somebody  The crown of their head  Will hit somebody  Right in the orbital  Of the eye  It's just like  Ugh  Yeah  Yeah it's  That's serious shit man 
[02:54:00]  How about fucking rugby  Yeah that's a wild sport  Those guys are fucking  Let's do that  With no safety equipment  My brother was a  My brother was a  Hardcore rugby guy  And nothing but props to him  I mean that sport  That sport is insane  Yeah that sport doesn't get  Nearly as much props  I'm really kind of surprised  That it never caught on  In America  You know  It's almost like  It's so rugged  It beats you up so bad  That like football players  Are like listen  Let's just  Say no to that  He played Ferroniana 
[02:54:30]  And I like to think  I'm tough  I like to think  I'm tough  And then I saw him  Play rugby  I'm like fuck no  Oh yeah  Like compound fractures  I don't fucking know  And they're always  Doing shit like  Digging their fingers  In each other's asses  And shit  That's grump  You know  They fuck each other up  Yeah  They do nasty shit  To each other  Unfortunately  One of my brother's friends  I wasn't aware of that  Unfortunately  One of my brother's friends  Got paralyzed playing rugby  And guess what  They continue playing  Oh my god  Next year 
[02:55:00]  They're out there playing  Never stopped them  Holy shit  Yeah  Someone close to them  Wow  Yep  And yeah  There's not even  Any money in rugby  It's not like  You're doing it  For a million dollars  They just signed  A twenty million dollar  Rugby contract  You never hear that one  It takes a special person  Man these guys  Loved it  The A-Rod of rugby  They loved it  How popular it is  In other countries  But just not here  And now my brother's  Waiting for his third kid  And stays away  From all that  Yeah once you have kids  Man that  That turns you  Into a giant pussy 
[02:55:30]  I had a daughter  A year ago  I'm a dad now  I'm a huge pussy now  Oh really  What has changed Joe  Besides the obvious  The obvious stuff  You want to nerf  The fucking world  You know  Oh really  Yeah you're like  Why's everybody  Going so fast  What the fuck  Slow down  Easy I got the baby  Rounded corners  With padding  And everything  Yeah  Your instincts  Your protective instincts  You know what  I wanted to stop  The show for a second  The brilliance of Joe Rogan  I want to nerf the world  Nerf the world  That's brilliant  My brother brings over 
[02:56:00]  His daughter  And she's one  She's one  And brings her over  To my house  From his house  Which he put down  Like fucking padding  In his living room  He had hardwood floors  You go in there now  And it's this interlocked  Like puzzle  Pieces of colorful padding  So again I go  I go  This is your fucking house now  I go Joe  This is your house  We fucking  We snorted coke  Like fucking mad men  We smoked fucking free base  And here it is 
[02:56:30]  With colorful puzzle piece things  So he comes over my house  And I might as well have  Yeah this is my end table  Made of like samurai swords  It's wonderful  This here is a glass table  Made of shards  That were glued together  And every time  The baby goes by  I find myself  Like taking my hand  And like cupping  Whatever is sharp  Around the baby's head  Yeah definitely  And everything is sharp  But imagine if it was  Your baby  It would be an even  More intense feeling 
[02:57:00]  Because literally  You're  It's like you  It's a part of you  It's a very innocent  Love  I mean it's better than you  You actually would  Probably die  To save the baby  That sounds like bullshit  That sounds like  Something in a movie  You're right  They do  They get like that  My brother fucking  I call it sleeping  Next to the bean pod  Like in Invasion  Of the Body Snatchers  Because the one thing  You're doing is  I don't want to be  One of these  I don't  I gotta stay awake  I gotta fucking do this  I can't do this  You fall asleep  You're like  Dude this is the  Greatest thing  It's not bad  Have a baby 
[02:57:30]  You fell asleep  Next to the pod  Well it's because  Your brain produces  A ton of oxytocin  Oxytocin is a chemical  And I talk about it  On stage  I say  It's to keep you  From eating them  When you get really hungry  But that's really  What it is  It's like this  Incredible love drug  That your brain produces  Wow  And if you think  It's cute  I got that during  A blowjob  Your baby  You can't believe  How much you love them  I was talking to  Jim Brewer  About being a parent  And he told me  You understand  Murder  When you become 
[02:58:00]  A father  And you understand  And you also realize  That you are capable  Of killing  Another human being  When you become  A father  Just if like  Someone is fucking  With your kid  Or something  You understand  That you could  Actually kill somebody  Yeah  I thought that was  Really interesting  He's like  Yeah  I understand  What murder is  Jim was like  The nicest guy  Yeah I know  He's like  No you understand  That you could  Actually kill somebody  You dead hammer  Cause soon as you see  I love Jim  Yeah he said  As soon as you see 
[02:58:30]  Your kid crying  And someone caused that  All bets are off  You understand that  You could kill  There was a story  In the news today  I was driving in  This creep  Out on Long Island  I think it was  He had a camera  Rigged up  Oh what a great story  For a 16  And some 16 year old girl  Was in the bathroom  And that's who he was  But the camera  Was in another house  Right  Yeah it was in another  Like he really rigged  It wasn't like a tenant  Or nothing  He actually somehow  Got into this  This room  Of the neighbor's house  And set up cameras  And they talked 
[02:59:00]  To the father  Of the girl  And he was like  He goes  I know this probably  Isn't the right thing  To say  He goes  But I want to  Kill this guy  Yeah  He goes  I want this guy  Dead  Yeah  Whoa  And you know  He meant it  Oh yeah  Oh for sure  That's like that guy  Remember a long time ago  His kid was  Taking those  Karate classes  And he got molested  By the teacher  Oh yeah  And they're bringing  The guy out  They're bringing him  Through  By the phone booth  The guy turns around  He blew the guy's brains out  They were standing  By the pay phones  Yeah he was standing  Right by the pay phones  The cops were leading  This guy out  It was like a fucking

[03:09:00]  Get out of here  That's the most persistent fly  I've ever seen  Nice  His first kill  Now  Where were we?  That was very impressive  Wasn't it?  I got it  I got the second  What do you think Gibbs?  That is very good  It's on  It's right there  It's right there  You wanna film that?  There it is  I like how they can't 
[03:09:30]  Just smoothly get back  Into the interview  They're gonna keep talking  Very good Mr. President  Very good  You killed the fly  Killed that fly  Very good  It was a nice shot  Wasn't it?  Well yes it was  Well  That's where it should end  Little fly family  Is gonna get a  Why can't we just  We regret to inform you  That your son the fly  Was killed in action today  By the president  Of the United States  That's where it should end  But here it is  PETA wishes  I just heard  He didn't call the fly  A sucker 
[03:10:00]  Right  PETA wishes Obama  Hadn't swatted that fly  Why?  What is their reasoning?  Every life is sacred?  I hope they all get malaria  Even though you get it  From a mosquito  Whatever  Same thing  Hate  This first line  Is gonna kill you  Listen to this  The group  People for the Ethical  Treatment of Animals  Wants to fly swatter  In chief  To try  Taking a more  Humane attitude  The next time 
[03:10:30]  He's bedeviled  By a fly  Trap it  And let it go  In it's own fucking  In a big pile of shit  How are you supposed to  What are you supposed to do  When a fly is bugging you?  Because that's what they do  In your ear  Landing on you  You kill it  What do they want you to do?  Well PETA is sending  President Obama  A catch-a-bug  Humane bug catcher  A device that allows users  To trap a house fly  And then release it outside  Catch and release 
[03:11:00]  A fucking fly  Right  You know what's funny?  I love animals  When I can't stand PETA  Yeah  They just  I don't know  The way they do it  Is just  I mean first of all  You're talking about  Insects here  I mean  Yes  Let's stop  Yeah fly  You know  Draw the line somewhere  What can we kill?  What would PETA not do?  He grabbed it by the wings  And started pulling its legs off  Yeah  Burning it with a magnifying glass  On the news  Like we used to do  Of course  It's fun  You do it one time  And then you're like  Is that the catch and release? 
[03:11:30]  How does that work Danny?  I'm trying to figure it out  I'm not quite sure  Does the fly fly through the tube  And go inside?  That looks like too much work  No that's like  And it looks ugly  If you're trying to keep up  A nice apartment or house  It looks like the thing  You wipe your ass with  That we were talking about  The other day  The comfort stick  Comfort stick  Did you buy a comfort stick there Bill?  I was just watching  That black guy breakdance  When he realized  He wasn't the baby's daddy  Come on  I'm sorry  What is a comfort stick?  Alright  Let's get through this 
[03:12:00]  And then  You're a fan of that  Late night TV  You like the infomercial  Oh yeah  I buy stuff  Set it and forget it  You bought the fucking  Sham wow  You turned us on  To the sham wow  I bought the little onion  Yeah and look what it did  A couple months later  That's right  He bites a hooker  Yeah  It's all good  Alright so  The catch a bug  Humane bug catcher  A device that allows users  To trap a housefly  And then release it outside  We support compassion  Even for the most curious  Smallest and least sympathetic animals 
[03:12:30]  PETA spokesman  Blah blah blah said  We believe that people  Where they can be compassionate  Should be for all animals  It's not an animal  It's a bug  Is this the onion?  Yeah what is this?  This is the onion  Is it the onion for real?  Is this a real story?  I don't want to be tricked  No come on  Really?  Doesn't matter  Even a fly  During the interview  Well then they explain  And blah blah blah  Still swatting a fly on TV  Indicates he's not perfect  This guy's from  PETA said  And we're happy to say 
[03:13:00]  That we wish he had it  If it was  You know  If it was  Like say  George Bush  That did that  I think they'd take  A little more of a hard line  They seem like  They're like  Well we really wish  He wouldn't have done that  They'd have been like  Protest  They're smart  PETA's smart  They know they would get  Headlines today  PETA on President's Fly  He isn't Buddha  He's a human being  And human beings  Have a long way to go  Boy kid gloves man 
[03:13:30]  Even PETA  They would have been  All over a Republican  All over  Fucking Iran  Still rocking it  Yeah they certainly are  Come on Iran  There's some trouble  Going on over there  I think it's more  Because he's a black guy  If he was a black Republican  Even then they would have to  Tone it down a little  Yeah I think you're right  But you never see  A black Republican  As a president  Don't you guys have a couple  Just to  You paid them off  To come out  And be like  Nah they're good white guys  Just to zoom in  With the camera  They zoom in on them  At the conventions and stuff 
[03:14:00]  Dude it's all a crock of shit  Anyways  Thank you Bill  That's my new take  I don't give a shit  Who's in there anymore  Yeah  I really don't  What did Obama say  We're gonna get you out of Iraq  He left that whole part  Yeah and then we're gonna  Send him to Afghanistan  Dude have you ever watched  Like one of those things  On like the Navy SEALs  Oh yeah  On like the Army Rangers  The Special Forces  You could send a dozen  Of them in there  And they'd come back  With Asama's head  In like eight days  Oh  Yeah  You don't need to send  All these aircraft carriers 
[03:14:30]  And crap in there  To get in  Send a few squads in there  Know what they're doing  Yeah  God damn  Yeah  Are they golfing  Yeah  You guys  In the rain  You guys finish the show  I gotta watch golf  They're golfing in the rain  Dude it is pouring  At Bethpage Black  And Tiger Woods is  Juicing  Wow  He's hitting in the woods  He's not having a good  First round at all  Look at the weather  It sucks  How do you play golf in that  What a nightmare  Stop it  Tiger Woods is huge  He's on the juice man

[03:15:30]  I'm trying to think  What the racial joke was there  I know  I'm trying to figure out  What it was  God forbid after listening to you  For years  That I would assume that  Tiger can't play in the rain  I'm like wait a minute  Where's the racial  Where's my racism there  Well it's raining so hard  All right  All right  Did he have to  Swim and he couldn't  Did he go back to a swimming joke  I thought you were going  For a swimming joke  Oh okay  I really did  That would really be raining  Huh  That would really be raining  Well it is raining like that  It's raining cats and dogs  Oh  Oh come on 
[03:16:00]  That was inappropriate  After the PETA story  Comfort stick for Bill  Please  You must be busy  You're not watching  Late night TV  This is all the rage  Can we play the commercial  For Bill  Yeah this is  We did an hour on this  The other day  We gotta get your take  On this one  Okay  Just  Some people said  It was the best hour  We've done in years  I thought it was a parody  I thought it was a parody  For over 100 years  We've been scrunching  And folding toilet paper  They make it so hard  To use toilet paper  Comfort Wife  The sanitary paper extension

[03:17:00]  Being a big guy  Certainly has its advantages  And its disadvantages  This is a great product  It's embarrassing  To have someone help you  With your personal matters  Jesus Christ  The comfort wipe  Allows you to maintain  Your dignity  While you maintain  Your personal hygiene  Hygiene  Comfort wipe  The sanitary paper extension  Arm and holder  The first improvement  To toilet paper  As we know it  Since the 1880s  What happened to the 1880s  It extends your reach  A full 18 inches  While it follows the contours  Of your body  And comfortably cleans  So if you or someone

[03:18:30]  Like tight enough  Where you can  Wipe your ass  How many times  Does the guy  Come back with that  And the toilet paper  Is gone  And there's just shit  All over the end  Of the car  Shit on the end  Of your fucking thing  Now you gotta wash it  Oh yeah  Being a big guy  Has its advantages  Yeah  What  And its disadvantages  You get to feel  What a heart attack  Feels like before  All your friends  Just on a daily basis  You can hide things  In your double chin  And then that woman  Having people help her

[03:20:30]  Like last season  Finally  You're finally out  My girl always watches it  Oh and they start crying  It's just the funniest thing ever  This might be too inside  But the last season  Of Biggest Loser  An old guy  He was in his 60s  Pretty much  Had like a heart attack scare  The first workout  Fell on the treadmills  His glasses went askew  My glasses  They had to rush him off  He gets voted off  Like the first or second week  Okay  Now the season's over  Four months later  They bring everyone back  For the live finale  To determine who 
[03:21:00]  Was the biggest loser  And they bring this guy out  He lost 150 pounds  He's thinner than me  And they don't even like  Ask the guy  How he did it at home  Wow  He just  He kept falling off the treadmill  And he'd be passed out  For three days  Without eating  The guy was old  And in horrendous shape  Kicked off the show  Comes back  And an amazing  Weight loss story  And they don't even mention  I'm thinking maybe  He had his like  Stomach staples  Or something  I'll assume before  Somebody seriously dies 
[03:21:30]  On that show  And then it'll be it  With that lady  Screaming at him  Oh yeah  It'll happen  Man impersonates  Dead mother  To get social security  Benefits  Anyone  Anyone  You know  I think a guy  Somebody who does  Some shit like this  They ought to  They should have  A lenient sentence  Just for the creativity  Yeah he really  Didn't go all out  Yeah he did  That's not just  You know  He's shown a lot  Of initiative  But we give this guy  A legal job  With his stick-to-tiveness  And his array of wigs  Authorities say  49 year old  Thomas Parkin  Is an accomplished 
[03:22:00]  Impersonator  So good in fact  That he collected  $117,000  In social security  Checks and rent subsidies  By impersonating  His mother  Irene Prusik  She died in 2003  But authorities say  Parkin impersonated her  For years  Going as far as  Donning sunglasses  A wig  And a dress  To conduct  Her personal business  This comes out  Number one  This guy's not stupid  This guy's very smart  And you know  I think  His schemes  Were absolutely brilliant  Authorities say 
[03:22:30]  The man on the right  In the surveillance video  Milton Romolo  Was posing as  The woman's nephew  Wow  He has also been  Charged in the case  Do you have anything  You want to say sir  Investigators say  Parkin falsified  His mother's death certificate  And lived in his  Mother's townhouse  Collecting rent subsidies  And falsely claiming  That he had a disability  And that his mother  Was still alive  And was his landlord  And then he dressed up  Like his mother  Oh man  And he even had  A scoffer on his  Maybe they explain  The next clip  A scoffer on his neck  To hide the Adam's apple 
[03:23:00]  But you know  What made it funny  Was he went down there  With the buddy of his  So you know  They had to have been  Laughing in the car  Yeah  Dude look at his  Fucking check  Rocks  But the home  Had been sold  In foreclosure  After Prusik died  And a dispute arose  Between Parkin  And the new owner  And authorities  Got wind of the  Alleged scam  As they investigated  Parkin dressed up  As his mother  And tried to keep  The ruse alive  He wore a scarf  Around his neck  So that it would  Prevent us from  Seeing the Adam's apple  He had large sunglasses 
[03:23:30]  Even inside the house  When we went to see him  And he had  An oxygen mask  On his face  As well  He and Romolo  Are charged with  Grand larceny  Criminal impersonation  And other charges  And they're both  Being held on  One million dollars bail  A million dollars for that?  A million bucks  Is like  Are you kidding?  That's like murder  You get less money  For murdering someone  Or less bail  But you fucked  With the Illuminati there  Ah  You're fucking  You're trying to get  You're trying to get  Off the wheel 
[03:24:00]  They don't let you do that  Off the wheel?  I like how he dressed  Like Nancy Reagan  Yeah  I know  Look at her  The big fucking glasses  The red  Got the red word  Look at her sign  In that thing  Where do I sign  Sonny?  It's their money  Anthony  Yep  It's theirs  They give it to you  And your job  Is to get into debt  And if you don't  They take it away from you  That's how it works  You're not supposed  To dress up like dead people  And get free shit  So that's why  A million dollar bail  Yeah  A million dollar bail  They put them 
[03:24:30]  In the bottom of the prison  With all the sodomites  He fucking makes sense  Sometimes Bill Burr  I wasn't listening though  How did they catch him?  How did they get suspicious?  Standing up  Because obviously  The mother did die  And the house  That he was trying  To hold on to  Was sold  How did it happen?  And I guess  Obviously he wanted  To live in the house  So he just  He just  Dressed up like her  And a dispute arose  Between the guy  That bought this  This house  And the son  Okay  So that's how it got 
[03:25:00]  Brought to the authority's  Attention  That's terrible  That's terrible  I'm sorry  How did your mother die?

[03:38:00]  kill the lobster before you cook it that's like they got to get him in the sweet spot that's how  they got maury in the fucking car in goodfellas with the fucking ice pick wow i just didn't think  he'd ever shut the fuck up you know what it is the reality is i'm just too spoiled is that i can  just go to the grocery store and get food right so i'm not hungry enough you know you get past a  certain level of hunger oh yeah i choke out my dog i told you i got a dog right i choke him out you  got a dog yeah i did check this fucking thing you got a pit bull right i got a blue nose pit bull 
[03:38:30]  look at that motherfucker fuck look at the mouth on that thing it's great it's got dude i'm telling you  shovel there's such the shit that people say about these dogs i'm sure it's true but when it's your  dog they love you and dude you walk down the street i've been doing this joke in my act i said  it's like having a gun you can pet you just walk down the street people just get the fuck out of  the way it's awesome it's awesome it's the best does it ever show anger in front of you no it's  really no no no no no it's it's been dude you know what it is any dog has the potential to bite

[03:39:30]  him but eventually i know there's going to be a lawsuit just going to bite the head off of one of those  fucking little and i won't get sued i already looked at it if my dog's on a leash and yours  isn't and you come running up and you're talking shit you're already looking at what the fuck can  get you in trouble with this dog aren't you no my girl got it when i was on the road right she  that's always a nice thing for girls to do this is what she does she goes uh she goes okay i did  something this is the message i did something it involves both of us but don't worry i think you're  gonna like it and i find out and she goes okay uh i agreed to foster this dog for a week 
[03:40:00]  like what does that mean she goes i'm watching a friend's dog for a week so i'm like all right  that's cool it's a week it's great the next time i call her and she goes okay yeah so the dog's here  it's awesome um and at the end of the week if we want to keep it we can and if not they take it to  the shelter and they're probably going to put it down and i'm like what the fuck then i find out it's  a fucking pitbull right and then this is i'm coming back on a monday she spent two days with the dog  she thinks she's going to go to work and i'm just going to meet the dog in the apartment yeah and i'm 
[03:40:30]  like the fuck i am you're taking that hellhound to work with you i'm going home and i'm sitting  in my apartment when you come home you call me and i'll go downstairs and i'll meet you and the dog  in the driveway and we'll all walk in together which we did and the dog was kind of looking at  me like dude what's up with you and then i just pointed to a picture of me on the mantle i'm like  i'm the guy paying the fucking bills yeah and it's been cool ever since and i was i was all ready to  get rid of it but dude after two days i fell in love with it i was just like did it wreck anything  um it had it took one swipe at a door and then that was it it had a little bit of separation
