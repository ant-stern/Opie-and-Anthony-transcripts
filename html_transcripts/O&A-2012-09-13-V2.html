<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts engaging in their characteristically vulgar and crude banter, focusing on bodily functions and sex.  They announce the show using offensive nicknames and discuss Mel Carverson's impending departure and the uncertainty surrounding Liberty Media's acquisition. Anthony then recounts a lengthy, graphic story about his son vomiting extensively in his car in Manhattan, detailing the chaotic cleanup.  The conversation shifts to the new iPhone, its design, features, and manufacturing in China, leading to a debate on labor unions and manufacturing costs. A rambling phone call from Frederico in Alberta, Canada, about a government conspiracy involving microchips follows, to which the hosts react.

The show continues with more rambling conversation before addressing a caller concerned about a perceived societal "divide." This caller then compliments the show before hanging up.  The hosts then launch into a comedic dissection of the movie *Cobra*, mocking its plot and dialogue with impressions and invented catchphrases.  A listener calls to discuss the Los Angeles bank robbery where robbers threw money from their car, prompting a discussion of the absurdity of the situation and the unlikelihood of the money being returned. The conversation then turns to the Benghazi attack, with the hosts debating the lack of security, political implications, and news coverage.  Multiple callers offer conflicting accounts and perspectives, leading to speculation on the attack's motives and criticisms of Obama and Romney's responses.

The show's next segment features a rapid-fire mix of topics. It starts with a brief, expletive-laden political discussion, followed by the announcement of "Big Ange" as a guest. Bob Kelly, another guest, enters, feigning illness before promoting his stand-up shows.  A Comic-Con attendee, Chip Chipperson (dressed as Toad), is interviewed, detailing drug use and dating struggles.  A lengthy, contentious discussion ensues about Bob Kelly's inflatable Sea Eagle fly fishing boat, involving anecdotes about Jim Norton breaking it. Opie reveals his wife's impending childbirth, previously teased on his website.  Further conversation includes discussion of Opie's website, a childhood photo, Sam Kinison, Bob Kelly's vocal problems, an FX pilot, a spicy Chipotle experience, a critique of RuPaul's appearance, and racist jokes.  Impersonations of Forrest Gump, more promotion for Bob Kelly's shows, and continued arguments about the Sea Eagle boat, culminating in a personal and emotional exchange between Opie and Kelly about their friendship, follow.  The segment ends with the introduction of Billy the Bassman and a "F.U." call segment filled with vulgar insults.  Bob Kelly promotes his show again, listing other performers.

The show moves to a segment focused on storytelling. The hosts struggle to find a suitable video, accidentally searching for wrestling clips before settling on a video of Bob Reiser, whose story of a one-inch boy with demons leads to speculation about pedophilia.  A pre-recorded segment with various storytellers, including Judy Piken, follows, with the hosts mocking the stories and storytellers' appearances.  The segment includes crude jokes and insults.  The hosts then promote upcoming appearances and play trailers for "Valley Gym," "American War Stories," and "Livewire."  A graphic video of a person with maggots in their nose and throat is shown, leading to more crude jokes and disgusted reactions.

Big Ang, author of “Bigger is Better,” finally arrives.  The hosts and Big Ang discuss her life, appearances on "Mob Wives," family, career, cosmetic surgeries, and arrest for drug dealing, all punctuated by vulgar humor and discussions of her relationships with mobsters. She promotes her book.  A subsequent segment continues the conversation with Big Ang, filled with vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments about her appearance and husband.  A running joke about "gravy" versus "sauce" emerges. Jimmy makes a brief appearance before leaving.  The hosts and guests engage in ethnic jokes and personal anecdotes.  Bobby Kelly and Brian Posehn join.  Posehn discusses his career, including his work on sitcoms, Marvel comics (specifically *Deadpool*), and Comic-Con experiences.  A discussion of a graphic scene from *Sons of Anarchy* ensues, with callers weighing in on its appropriateness, especially regarding violence against children.  The segment concludes with vulgar jokes and banter before transitioning to "After Opie and Anthony Live." Neil Murphy, a very large man, is briefly introduced.

Finally, a segment featuring Brian Posehn focuses on his experiences with female fans, his long-term relationship, and his stand-up comedy, including self-deprecating bits. He discusses performing for celebrities like Scott Ian and in areas with strong metal music scenes.  The segment concludes with promotional information for his upcoming shows at Caroline's.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What or before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like romance?  I'm about to get a second.  With Opie, the destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Ha, ha.  Voices.  Hey, everybody.  Hello.  Morning.  I think I was just here, right?  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  I think I just stepped out for a few minutes and then came back in.  Well, we're back.  Yes.  It's gonna be back.  Aye.  For now.  Uh.  Wah, wah.  What is everyone sending me?  I guess our boss is leaving and everyone's tweeting articles about it.  Uh, in the paper?  The paper, the paper?  Well, it was a big article today that Mel Carverson's leaving us.  Any, uh, date on that?  We've known Mel for many, many years.  Many, many years.  Mel.  Although I haven't had a conversation with him in probably years. 
[00:02:30]  Many, many years.  Two years.  In a while.  Not even a conversation with the guy.  Yeah, I saw him recently.  We'll see what happens.  He didn't say hi.  Like, I mean, I'm not saying he hates me, but I don't think he likes me too much.  I probably hate you.  You might be right.  I saw him at the, um.  Last time I saw him was at the, uh, McCartney show, I think.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And he nodded at you?  I had a couple words.  He's good at nodding at you.  But words?  Oh, I had a conversation with him recently.  He was getting in the elevator and he goes, hey, you still work here? 
[00:03:00]  Like, real funny.  That's hilarious.  Maybe you should be asking that about Howard.  Oh, boy.  Not us.  The guys that are actually coming here every day.  Yump in Yemeni.  But I guess Liberty Media is about to take over this joint.  Liberty.  Hope they like us.  For your diabetes supplies.  Believe me, dude.  I want to get my name on something quickly.  I know.  Who knows?  They could be like CBS.  We love open hand, but.  Yeah.  We don't know about the other guy. 
[00:03:30]  He's too dirty.  Oh, oh.  Oh, God.  I hope that happens.  I mean, I mean, I mean.  Oh, man.  We got a new, we got a new suitor.  Like my ex.  Yes, we do.  We got a new suitor.  A suitor.  We might have a new girlfriend soon.  Could there be a romance in the air?  Or maybe not.  Or maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe we're not, uh, we're not her type.  This shit is going down soon, man.  Yeah.  And we'll see.  That usually means a bunch of changes.  Yeah.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[00:04:00]  Wait, do you remember that from the comeback?  Did you see the comeback?  Oh, yeah.  When she's in the house and the stepdaughter comes in and asks her advice on something and  she goes, whoa.  Ch-ch-ch-changes.  It's the most uncomfortable one.  Oh, it's so douchey.  The comeback rules.  Yeah, that was a douchey shit.  Oh, yeah.  Ch-ch-ch-changes.  That's fucking funny.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  South Jersey Rich goes, yeah, Farid is coming.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:30]  Farid.  I might have wrote Farid recently.  No.  Oh, yeah.  How could you even talk to him?  I might have wrote Farid recently.  What a fucking piece of shit.  I wrote, I've talked to Elo.  I wrote Farid.  He wrote me back.  Did he?  Has he got some stock tips?  I'm looking at my options.  Stock tips?  We're all looking at our options.  Jesus Christ.  Hi, Farid.  What's going on with you?  Oh, God.  Dude, it was the worst thing.  She was just trying to express her joy that her stepdaughter had asked her something. 
[00:05:00]  She had on those awful sweatpants that are windy sweatpants.  Hammer time, sweatpants.  I think it was the plastic ones, if I remember.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Change.  Are you a big fan of the girls that walk around the streets in their pajama pants?  I like that.  It's becoming a thing.  Oh, my God.  I like that a lot.  You get to see their loose hineys.  It's comfy.  They're loose hineys.  Loose, but taut.  Yeah, it's good. 
[00:05:30]  Taunt or taut?  Taut.  I like that, though.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It moves around, but it moves around in a solid mass.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  It's not like a mudslide happening back there.  A mudslide.  You want to hear a cute little story about a kid puking?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Projectile?  Oh, my God.  The first time a kid puked in my fucking car.  Would that drive you nuts?  You would throw the car away, right?  I have to.  You would have to throw your car away.  And the kid.  I'd torch it.  And the kid.  And the kid. 
[00:06:00]  If my kid wasn't so cool, we would have had a problem yesterday.  Oh, man.  I understand some things.  I understand some things parents do.  Oh, no.  No.  What happened?  Well, I was getting my car serviced.  And I told the guy.  I said, look, I need the car before rush hour because I got to get the fuck out of town.  I got some shit to do.  Living in the limelight.  I got to get my lunatic sister out of my fucking house and pass her on to somebody else. 
[00:06:30]  So get the fucking car done before rush hour, please.  My sister is up from Florida.  My half-sister.  Although, I mean, she's my sister.  But for discussion purposes, she's from my dad's first marriage.  The one that went horribly bad.  Thus, then, marrying my crazy mom.  And what I mean by going bad, meaning dying at a very, very early age.  I think she was, like, 26 or something.  That's the only reason I'm here. 
[00:07:00]  This is my dad's first true love.  His high school sweetheart died.  But anyway, that's his kid and my sister from his first marriage.  And, man, she was telling me some fucking horror fucking stories about my mom.  And I don't want...  I just, like, look, I want to just fucking live my life.  I don't want to go back there anymore.  Yeah.  So it was time to get rid of my sister and move her on to somebody else.  But the fucking guy didn't get my car done in time.  And so I had to leave the city in rush hour to go north Jersey for the locals. 
[00:07:30]  I had to go over to GWB at 5.30.  Yeah.  I could hear it right now.  I could hear it in their voices.  Like, oh, fuck, seriously?  I'm like, yeah.  Because I'm not a 9 to 5-er, so I luck out.  I don't have to fucking drive in that shit.  Yeah.  It's one of the things we're lucky about.  It's terrible.  So I decide to go Broadway up to the GWB.  Have you ever done Broadway up to the GWB?  That means staying in Manhattan.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  So I got my kid in the back because I want him to have to, you know,  go say hi to his cousins up there.  So I'm fucking making moves.  I'm doing some Anthony Cumia shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm making some moves.  Not for the delicate little stomachs.  Well, that's what I learned, unfortunately.  Oh, no.  My first mistake was I didn't put his movie on.  What I've learned from a very early stage in this whole thing,  you put a movie on for your fucking kid if you're in a car.  You got it.  Because that's what we got nowadays. 
[00:08:30]  We're lucky.  I forgot to put his movie on.  Because what happens is his dumb little eyes,  and I mean dumb in the sweetest, nicest way, by the way,  because I love my kid to death,  and I would fucking kill someone over him.  When they focus on the fucking screen,  they don't notice the motion of the car.  The moves, right.  So that was my first mistake.  Oh, no.  And then I'm making the Anthony Cumia moves  where I'm fucking stop, go, stop, go,  fucking moving to this lane.  Now I got to cut over here.  I'm going through this fucking red light.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he starts asking for his mom. 
[00:09:00]  Like when I left mom home because she's very pregnant.  Oh, no.  And when we go separate, the kid's usually cool.  He understands, like, oh, I don't need mommy and daddy.  I got daddy.  I'm cool.  But he starts whining for mommy.  And I'm like, that's a little weird, too.  That was sign number two.  Sign number two that was just not acknowledged.  And then he starts whimpering.  And I'm like, that's weird.  But we've both been sick.  I'm like, all right, he's still dealing with shit.  And then I looked at his eyes and they were a little fucked up. 
[00:09:30]  Parents know this.  You can look at your kid's eyes and realize they're a little fucked up.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, ah.  So make a long story short, right around Spanish Harlem,  way up there in the 130s, 140s,  he fucking power boots at a red light.  I mean, everywhere.  Everywhere.  I mean, everywhere.  What the little guy have to eat. 
[00:10:00]  There was a hunk of cheese in there that made me almost puke.  There was a hunk of cheese that came out.  That's what got me.  It was brown.  It was brownish in nature.  Look at that.  Just because baby vomit goes everywhere.  Oh, man.  It just power boots.  He's in the back seat and he's in a car baby seat.  Right in the middle of the back seat.  Right.  Facing forward or back facing forward?  Oh.  Just, I mean, all for the intricate fucking seatbelts of the baby seat. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All those little harnesses.  And crannies.  And little buckles.  His little polo shirt is completely soaked in puke.  He gets motion sick.  Yeah.  He's got it.  Oh, man.  And I go to my sister.  I go, look, I can't pull over.  This is the worst part of Manhattan.  Oh, man.  I mean, I was at one red light and I could get my sister on the phone to back me up.  There were gangs yelling at each other from across the street.  Right.  And then I'm looking around like a horrified white guy and then there's guys in the median, 
[00:11:00]  you know, in between the lanes laughing at me.  They're like, yep, this shit is going down and you're sitting here right now at a red light.  Oh, shit.  It's basically what they told me with their eyes.  And I'm like, oh, fuck.  So I go, I can't.  I can't fucking stop.  And from that point to the GWB, I can't stop.  So at every light, we're both turning around with wipes and just wiping up just mucusy puke.  Was he trying?  No, because at that point he was cool.  Now he's like, hey, I want to watch my fucking movie. 
[00:11:30]  Feel good now.  Kids don't understand messes.  They don't give a fuck.  You care about the mess.  So every light turning around, every light just soaking it up and putting it in a plastic bag.  And my sister's now dry heaving because she can't take puke.  Now you've got to soak that up.  Those big pieces of brain and skull, you've got to get that up.  Yeah, I need the wolf.  I needed the wolf.  I needed the wolf.  Where's the fucking wolf? 
[00:12:00]  And then we're going over the GWB, just cleaning up puke all the way to my brother's house in Jersey.  Let's not start sucking each other's dicks just yet, gentlemen.  Right.  And it still smells like puke, by the way.  Oh, man.  Well, that's the problem with living in the city.  You can't just pull over somewhere and hose it down.  There's nowhere to pull over.  There's literally nowhere to pull over in Manhattan.  So how long did you drive with that smell?  A half hour.  I decided to go for it.  Because at that point, my sister did an amazing job cleaning it up. 
[00:12:30]  So now he was just kind of soaked.  Yeah.  So.  In the worst part of Manhattan.  So what happened when you took the car seat out?  You hosed everything off?  No, I did not.  I wanted to socialize.  Oh.  No, I didn't want to waste my time.  Lick it all crusty.  Because remember I said I had to go in rush hour?  So I got there at 7.  I mean, I have to be in bed by 9.30.  I only had a couple hours.  Oh, my God.  To be with my brother and his kids.  Whew.  We put them.  We got new clothes on them and stuff. 
[00:13:00]  You know, I gave them like a washcloth bath.  Clean them up, yeah.  Does the car smell now?  Yeah, when I pulled back into my building, it still smelled.  I asked for some Febreze.  I just sprayed it down.  I said, look, I'll just fucking deal with this.  I got to go.  But it still smells.  That's going to be horrific by today.  I'd have to go.  You would throw the whole car away, right?  I'd have to.  You can get it out, though, because I talked to Ruby, who drives me a lot, and he said that,  you know, it happens.  He thinks sometimes a dog will puke in the car or a kid.  He goes, it comes out.  If you get the car detailed, it'll come out. 
[00:13:30]  Ruby didn't say it happens like when Ope's kid is in my car?  No, he said that's how the conversation started.  You know about that?  This is the first time my kid has puked in my actual car, but he has puked twice in Ruby's  car.  Oh, man.  And Ruby is an OCD freak about his cars.  He has a, what is it, a Mercedes?  He picks me up.  Or BMW.  He has a bunch.  I get the older Mercedes.  It's 10 years old.  It looks like he just bought it.  That's what I'm getting at.  He has a Mercedes that's 10 years old.  I swear to you, if you didn't know, I don't know cars. 
[00:14:00]  I would have sworn it was a brand new fucking car.  I did think it was new.  I had no idea that it was 10 years old.  My kid puked in that car on the way home from the airport after our big trip to Turks  and Caicos.  Oh, boy.  One mile from the house.  I think I told the story in the air.  Almost made it.  Yeah.  And he's like, don't worry about it.  And I'm like, I'm kind of like you.  I'm like, how much to make this go away?  And I'm just peeling off money.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to give him a good gratitude.  Clean up my kid's puke, but I'll make it worth your while.  Good gratuity must be given in that circumstance.  And then we rented a van when my wife graduated from college. 
[00:14:30]  It was a big deal.  We had to go up to Fordham's, but I needed a big, huge, fucking nice vehicle to get everyone  up there for the graduation ceremonies.  He puked in that, too.  So he's puked in two of Ruby's cars.  That's a good suggestion from a fish man here.  You need a dog, Opie, to clean the kid off after it pukes.  Dogs love vomit.  They really do.  It's nice and warm.  It's probably like a Friendly's Fribble to them.  Oh, God, no. 
[00:15:00]  He'd be there.  Yeah, my dog Fresca, rest his soul.  He would lap up puke when we were growing up.  He would lap it up like it was nothing.  That's pretty disgusting.  Like a rock star, he would lap that shit up.  Yeah.  And you know what those stupid tongs that would get in the nooks and crannies?  Oh, every nook and cranny.  Dogs are great like that.  Of the intricate seat belt.  That's why women love that peanut butter trick.  They get right in there.  Oh, yeah.  Hit the clit and the folds behind the labia.  Everything.  Right.  Places guys won't even go. 
[00:15:30]  Yep.  Yeah, dogs are like maggots on a fucking wound when they eat pussy.  That's when you know you're a lovey kid, though.  I didn't even give a fuck.  I mean, if you were in the car, you'd be out of your mind.  Oh, of course.  I'm not stupid, but when it's yours, you don't fucking care, man.  Yeah.  That's how that shit works.  I just don't care.  Nature blocks that stuff out.  It's weird.  So you can take care of...  Yeah.  It does a certain amount of that.  I was bothered slightly, I would be, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  The radio wizard bothers me way more just walking past the studio than what happened yesterday. 
[00:16:00]  Huh?  He's puked in your car?  Oh, if he puked in my car, I would throw him off the GWB.  I would stop the car, and I would actually throw him over the side.  Something tells me if he was in your car on the GWB, you'd throw him off the side.  Oh, absolutely.  Something tells me he would get out before the bridge.  He would know better.  He walked past me yesterday and knew not to say a word.  He just was defeated again.  Yeah.  The poor radio wizard.  Maybe Mel could take him with him. 
[00:16:30]  But that...  I don't know where the story goes, but that's what happened to me.  That's all you really need.  It was, I guess, the highlight puking in the worst part of Manhattan.  I think it's Spanish Harlem, isn't it?  Broadway way up there?  I don't even know.  Is that West?  No, I don't think it's Spanish.  It's past Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard, which is nice, because that's the heart of Harlem.  I actually ride my bike down Martin Luther King Boulevard now.  East is Harlem.  Spanish Harlem.  So what's on the west side?  Just Harlem.  It's bad.  Goes up into Inwood or Washington Heights. 
[00:17:00]  It gets weird and bad up there.  And you see a lot of...  I'll just say you see a lot of colors.  What street?  A lot of colors.  Not colored.  Right, right.  Because you do see colored going old school, but you see a lot of colors, if you know what  I mean.  And I don't even want to say which colors, because I don't want to piss off the other  colors.  Oh, they're all kinds.  Oh, gagging me.  Yeah, yeah.  Wonderful, colorful.  But you see them.  They're like, yeah, that's right.  This is what we are.  Yeah.  And there's more than one color.  Yeah.  There's groups of colors, I should say. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  And there's colors I've never seen.  Yellow?  Well, there might have been some yellow.  Yeah.  You know yellow.  Or gold, whatever the one is.  Do I think the Latin Kings are gold?  Yeah, that's Latin Kings.  That's why I'm not mentioning which colors.  There might have been that color up there.  Reds and blues, everyone knows.  But usually you see maybe one guy with one color.  You know you're in a bad area when you see colors.  Two guys.  Yeah.  Colors.  You were at Broadway and what?  It was past Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know where that's...  If you go on a map, it starts to...  That's the part of Manhattan where it starts getting narrow.  Yeah.  Is that...  Between Martin Luther King Boulevard and the GWB, it gets a bit shady.  Yeah.  Way more...  That's Martin Luther King.  Way crazier.  Do they spell it T-I-N or do they spell it properly?  M-A-R-T-H-A.  M-A-R-T-H...  What?  Oh, Mayor Menino.  Oh, Martin Luther King Boulevard.  As we travel to Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[00:18:30]  Is that the GWB?  Yeah.  I don't know what area it is.  Someone help us out.  I have no idea.  You might have been beyond Harlem.  No, no, no, no, no.  Beyond Harlem.  Go to...  Where's Martin Luther King Boulevard?  It's way before that there, Sam.  Way...  Keep going down.  Is it 120...  134th?  Yeah, it's somewhere...  Might be 134th.  It's somewhere...  Yeah, see, Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.  Martin Luther King Boulevard.  That's 125th. 
[00:19:00]  4th.  I actually ride my bike and I do...  I hang out in that part of Harlem because there's a lot of culture and a lot of shit to  see.  And during the day, especially, I don't feel like I'm in danger.  Is that where the Apollo is?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Right on Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.  I'm telling you, it's kind of cool to check out if you're ever in New York.  Because people ask me all the time, don't go to Times Square.  Fucking go up to Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.  And I'm not joking.  And walk around during the day.  I wouldn't suggest that at night because I don't know that fucking... 
[00:19:30]  But it's cool up there.  I think it's busy enough at night.  It's like I Am Legend.  No, you can walk around during the day, but then at night, you know, you got to go back  to your house, pour bleach on the stairs, and lock the doors.  I don't know if it's a problem at night.  I'm not sure.  The film used to be the culture center of the world.  Ah.  So there's some cool shit to check out up there.  I wouldn't go wandering off Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard too much, but I would definitely  take that stroll during the day.  Google Maps ought to have, like, you know how they get the satellite view and the traffic  view.  They ought to have an overlay for white people where it just, like, shows just red borders 
[00:20:00]  and boundaries.  But my point, 125, that's fine.  But I was way higher.  And it gets, it gets...  Oh, that looks nice.  There's...  Yeah, it's fine.  It's fine.  A little Subway, a little Lincoln fried chicken.  Lincoln fried chicken?  I'll bet you it's really good.  I bet.  Wait, are you at the start of Martin Luther King Boulevard, Sam?  Let's Google, let's take a ride down Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard on Google Maps.  And this is your assignment, Sam, if you don't mind. 
[00:20:30]  I want to know how many chicken joints.  And I want to know the names of them too.  I like Lincoln fried chicken.  That's a good one.  We start with Lincoln fried chicken.  They use the name of Abraham Lincoln.  But you get higher, like 25 to 30 blocks higher, and you will not see English on any  of the storefronts.  Yeah.  It's...  Wow.  Wow.  Pretty crazy.  Wow, yeah.  Oh, well, we're on street view.  Apple came out with an iPhone announcement yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  And?  Looked pretty good.  You know, it's a little longer.  They kept the same width, so you could still use one hand and a thumb to do your little  texting.  Your old docks can you use?  No.  Give me your brand new dock.  The lightning, is it called?  Wait, brand new dock, so you have to change all your shit?  I hate when cell phones do that.  There's an adapter or just a brand new cord.  Yeah, but the adapter will cost you too, right?  Well, of course, yeah.  To adapt to your old cords? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  It's a faster connection.  I hate when companies do that.  It's smaller.  And it fits both ways.  So, you know, it's not just a one.  Well, there's always a reason why they do it, but they want that extra, they want the  accessory money.  I don't think it's that as much as, the new phone is thinner.  There's a lot more shit in it, electronics wise.  So, they had to make the connector smaller to fit all the goodies in there and stuff.  So, that's what they say.  But I don't think it's exclusively like, hey, let's make some money on an adapter.  Well, my experience when I was in the BlackBerry world, which I'm way out of, I fucking hate 
[00:22:00]  BlackBerry.  I'm done with them.  You're not alone.  We'll never go back.  But I hung in there way longer than I should have.  They had the phone charger where they just changed it just because they wanted to fucking  make you buy, you know, that, you know, the car adapter and everything else that goes  with it.  It went from just being sort of, well, everyone knows, and then they just made it just slightly  skinnier.  Yeah.  There was no reason to do that except, look, this is another way we can make money. 
[00:22:30]  And probably why they're just a shitty company.  They blew it.  They had such a fucking lead in the smartphone world.  Yeah.  And they blew it.  There's a reason, you know, so they say, for this one, for this change.  But they also know that, you know, extra money will roll in.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Let me see your, put this up against the Samsung Galaxy 3.  The standard iPhone now?  That's just the way it is now.  Well, no, but you're saying that it's not wider?  Yeah, it's going to be. 
[00:23:00]  So.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, it's not going to be any wider than that.  Than this?  Yeah.  But it's going to be another half inch taller.  Look how much bigger my fucking Galaxy 3 is.  Will the screen be the same length or no?  The screen's going to be another half inch longer.  It's longer.  Longer.  But, and no more, no wider?  No wider.  Why?  It's a little, it's more, it's like fucking letterbox.  It's kind of weird, isn't it?  I like the size of Ops phone.  The Galaxy S3 that, because people are like, you got to get it.  I was, whatever. 
[00:23:30]  I was going to go off on something.  It doesn't matter to anybody.  But the S3, I don't feel like I have a huge phone in my pocket.  I really don't.  Yeah.  They felt like they wanted to keep it where it's very handy in one hand.  Like, I text with my thumb all the time.  I just, one thumb, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Look what I do.  Yeah, but you know what?  Look what I do.  But you're a guy, you know, you get a chick with small hand.  Dude.  All of a sudden she, you know, like Voss.  Look how sad these hands are.  They're pathetic. 
[00:24:00]  It's, uh, they just decided they were going to keep it like this, width-wise.  Hmm.  Very interesting.  I'd like to, I'd like to wider, a little wider.  Sure.  Dude, I, I, the, the wideness of this phone, it just makes, it seems.  Not.  No, I know it's not, but it just looks like it in this fucking picture.  One hand, a big fat hand on the left, and a thinner hand.  Wait, put yours, put yours up in the air again. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  No, man, that's going to look weird to be a little longer.  A little longer.  And why are they making it a little longer then?  Uh, to, uh, the display as far as fitting a few more things on your screen.  A few more apps and shit?  Um, yeah.  And, and for the video.  Yeah, but for the video, I, I, I, I think you're going to.  I think you need wider before longer.  Do you watch, I don't watch video on my phone unless it's a quick, uh, Twitter.  I watch a lot of video on my phone.  Never.  I watch a lot on my phone.  Because I don't like.  A lot.  It's so, like, I see people on planes sometimes.  I'll see them, it's amazing how uncomfortable people are willing to be. 
[00:25:00]  They'll sit there and they'll hold it sideways and watch a movie.  Oh.  What the fuck do you do?  First of all, why are you holding it?  Yeah.  It's so small.  I wouldn't do that.  Watch a movie.  It's like looking through a Viewmaster.  Yeah.  An iPad or something.  I saw the, uh, the Galaxy, what is it called?  Samsung Note.  Wow.  What is it?  I think the businessmen love that fucking thing.  Oh, the iPad?  It's big.  It's like my phone, but it goes out to about here.  Let the record show.  About an inch and a half wider, probably. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  But, and I was talking to a kid in the cell phone store, this kid, Greg.  Greg?  Greg!  And, yeah, he's just one of these fucking Manhattan fucking hip dudes.  He's 16 and already knows everything about the world.  And, uh, he was showing me.  He put it in his back pocket.  He's like, look, I don't notice at all, man.  But it's big.  And you gotta sit on it.  But, basically what they're saying is...  Sit on it, Potsy.  You don't need your stupid iPad.  It's big enough where pretty much everything you're doing on the iPad, you can get away  with on the note. 
[00:26:00]  Are new iPads the same size or are they smaller?  Um, iPad's the same size.  What?  Oh, the new ones are coming out the...  Same size?  Oh, later.  Okay.  But, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I could...  I like the iPad, though.  Like, if I go home and, uh, I don't want to...  Like, like, watching something on the iPhone's too small, uh, but I don't feel like,  you know, having the computer open and running, uh, the iPad's great for that.  And I like the size of it.  But, I don't think they should make it smaller.  I agree.  Like, like, cause you...  It's not a thing that I carry around with me.  Uh, but I do like having it, you know, up in the bedroom, you just... 
[00:26:30]  It's amazing.  You've got it in your hand.  It's amazing.  I'm watching HBO Go on it.  I have it set up.  For some reason, I can't log in on my laptop like a fucking asshole.  Oh!  I don't know what the...  Don't get...  But, uh, it's fucking awesome.  Except the volume on the iPads, but...  What?  When Bob Kelly told me about the iPad a few years ago, he goes, dude, you know, you're  gonna touch it.  Boom.  It's gonna be like a touch screen.  I'm like, yeah, it just didn't make sense to me.  We laughed.  Right.  I remember this show laughed at.  Yeah, it was recently.  Wouldn't you just have a laptop?  We laugh at Bobby a lot with his technology. 
[00:27:00]  And then he's...  Usually right.  Then he's right.  Fucking asshole.  But even after Bobby was, you know, came and went, we're like, this iPad thing is the  dumbest idea.  Why would you do that?  It was too much of a hybrid thing.  And now we totally...  Between the phone and the laptop.  Yeah.  We all get it.  What is that stylus?  What the fuck is that stylus?  A stylus.  Of a galaxy.  Who uses a stylus?  You don't have to use the stylus.  Why don't they stop with that?  You know what?  I think that fucked up the marketing of this thing.  Because the stylus, everyone's like, why would you go backwards and use a stylus?  That looks terrible. 
[00:27:30]  They should...  The stylus is just an option.  Right.  But I don't think they made that clear when they were trying to market this note.  Is it a smart stylus?  They should put it down and then the guy could use his finger and show either way.  That's terrible.  Because the stylus could be convenient, to be honest with you, but you don't have to  use it if you want to use the galaxy note.  It's just sticking the stylus up his ass and then using his finger.  A cuke.  But the note is made for the business guys where he could leave his fucking iPad at home  and has his phone and a screen big enough to get all his shit done and watch shit as well. 
[00:28:00]  Do you remember styluses, how advanced they looked on smartphones and stuff?  With the little slot for it.  And everyone lost their stylus.  Everyone did.  That was the problem.  It was nothing you could fucking hang on to.  I didn't know what to do with my hair.  I lost my stylus.  Then you didn't know where to get a new one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, they still have to figure that out.  Writing down, like actually handwriting on a smart glass is not perfected yet.  It just looks shitty.  It looks shitty, but usually now they convert it to regular text. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, okay.  Let's get there.  Siri's getting better, too, I noticed.  Maybe I'm just talking clearly.  There's a new option, too.  Well, there's new additions to Siri on the new iPhone also where it includes sports scores and whatnot.  So you could just say, Siri, what's the score of the Yankee game?  And it'll give you the score during the game and shit like that.  What else are you getting with the iPhone 5?  You get a longer display.  Yeah.  Longer display.  New chipset.  What's that?  Wow, that was cool. 
[00:29:00]  What they just did on the note and the video.  They're actually using the finger now.  There was video on top of the screen, and the guy took his finger and dragged the video to the bottom of the screen.  That was pretty fucking cool.  The note is, for someone like you, Jimmy, that travels, you might want to look into it as just a little, maybe a second phone or something.  Oh, no.  If you've got two phones, I mean.  Well, I do.  I mean, instead of having two iPhones, you might want to look into that just to see.  I have a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  Oh, naughty boy phone and a good boy phone. 
[00:29:30]  I like the...  What else about this?  They have like a passbook feature where you store...  Could you go to the Apple thingy?  Are people blown away by this announcement?  It's just time for a new phone from Apple.  It's time for a new phone.  Are they blown away with what they were told yesterday?  No.  You know what?  I think it's become such commonplace now.  It's very hard to blow people away.  Like, the initial announcement of the iPhone was unbelievable.  A couple of the other improvements.  But now it's like, all right, it's just a new iPhone. 
[00:30:00]  What's the headline here?  Just a longer screen?  Yeah, yeah.  The change in the design.  That seems weird to me.  I would have went slightly wider before longer.  They do have some features that were taken directly from the Samsung thing.  The Pano.  Rip it off Samsung?  It's pretty good.  Those motherfuckers.  I like that.  The face recognition.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Things like coupons and...  Coupons?  And airline boarding passes and whatnot.  You store in your passbook and just scan things that way. 
[00:30:30]  Which is...  I kind of like where that's headed.  I kind of like having some of your shit on your phone where you can pay for things and  get those, whatever, discount if that's what you're doing.  Other countries have been doing that for a while.  Scan things.  Like, if you...  Like, let's say...  Starbucks has is one of the only ones, right?  Movie theaters.  Like, if you buy a ticket online, I like the idea that you just have your phone.  You walk in.  You don't have to fucking look or talk to anybody.  You just pass by something and it scans it and you know it's paid for and that's that. 
[00:31:00]  Like, I like that idea.  I like taking fucking the human equation out of things.  I love it.  That's what we're doing.  Yes.  You can board your plane.  And this is the weird part.  This happened after 9-11.  Yeah.  You can board your plane with not talking to anybody until you get the security with  carry-on or you don't have to talk to any gate agents or anything.  Yeah, yeah.  You self-check out.  I don't like that.  What do you mean?  I self-check out.  I do too at CVS.  It rules.  Oh, oh.  What?  At CVS?  Yeah.  CVS has it too. 
[00:31:30]  I haven't seen that.  I usually still go up to the fucking Spanish girl behind the counter.  CVS has self-check out.  Next.  But then they have a dummy just standing there at self-check out.  So then I'm thinking, well, why don't you get your ass behind a fucking cash register?  Yeah.  It seems like a waste.  They're always just trotting around with one person behind the counter.  I like that self-check out.  Yeah.  What else do we got there, Samuel, on the iPhone, the big announcement yesterday?  I was pissed because I couldn't find the actual video feed of the keynote. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know if they do it.  Do they broadcast it?  They do it late.  Is there it?  Because I saw, like, everybody covering it.  I saw a bunch of, like, podcasts of people covering it, but there was no actual video.  That was kind of annoying.  Is the iPhone still made in China?  Of course.  Well, you don't have to show the keynote.  What do you mean, of course?  Just show, like, the features.  Why couldn't Apple figure out how to make that shit in America?  Because of that.  I understand possible that.  I'm going to blame the unions.  I'll blame the unions. 
[00:32:30]  Wow, man.  We got union guys listening right now.  I know we do.  What the fuck?  They also know that.  What the fuck?  Why the fuck would Apple go, yeah, you know, I have some national pride and I want it made  in the United States, but this guy makes $57 an hour when I could have some cute little  Asian kid soldering it together for $3.  Oh, these are all made in China?  Yeah.  That would be a big fucking, you know, what, pump. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  A big, let's say, influx of work into the economy.  An economic boost.  Thank you.  An economic boost for America.  You know, there's a mid-ground between management and labor that it's just, when you get a labor  union, it's so that way that a manufacturer is going to lose money by making things in  the United States.  Or have to charge.  Like, you're paying $400 or $500 for an iPhone.  And they'll go, okay, we'll make it here, but it's going to be $1,000 for the iPhone. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  People aren't going to buy it.  Exactly.  The same people that are bitching about jobs leaving the country won't buy it because it's  too expensive.  But the truth of the matter is, the unions were good years ago when labor was fucking  completely taking advantage, when management was completely taking advantage of the labor  force.  I understand that.  But it's gone so far the other way with unions that a lot of companies can't afford to have  American labor anymore making things. 
[00:34:00]  It's too expensive.  That's why we don't make anything.  We're a consuming country.  We don't make anything anymore.  We should be making the iPhone and all Apple products here.  Oh my God, Apple.  Parts are made in the U.S., but the majority of it just stuck together in China.  Apple seems like one of those companies where they try to do the right thing to a point.  And then they're like, look, we can't.  We got to go to China.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, America.  The front-facing cam is also, the one that faces you, is also now a 780p. 
[00:34:30]  You could do FaceTime over your cellular connection.  Wait, cellular?  You mean with a 3G or 4G?  Yeah, they also have the LTE now, which is a lot faster.  What's that?  It's part of the data exchange on your cellular provider.  If you get good service, it can be faster than Wi-Fi.  Faster than Wi-Fi for your data over cellular.  So when can you use LTE?  Whenever you're in LTE service. 
[00:35:00]  I think AT&T Verizon has it, so you don't have to worry.  You'll have LTE.  Have you used the self-checkout on the phone itself, like in the Apple Store?  Yes, once.  You have to download the app real quick.  What do you mean?  You self-checkout on Apple.  Like you download the Apple Store app on the phone.  You do everything yourself and just walk out of the store.  Yeah, you scan.  Without talking to anybody.  You take the product off the shelf.  You scan it.  Well, it takes your credit card from iTunes that it already has.  You click pay, and then you just hold it, and you can either ask someone for a bag or just walk out. 
[00:35:30]  How do you know they have that service?  You don't know about that service?  They told me when I was checking out.  All Apple Stores have it.  Oh, all Apple Stores.  Okay, I thought you were just somewhere, anywhere.  You're just going, I'd just start scanning things and walk out with my merchandise.  It's cool because you really feel like you're stealing, which is kind of fun for everyone.  That is fucking great because I don't like waiting on those lines.  You feel like you're going to get pulled down to the ground, even though it's all on the up and up. 
[00:36:00]  You're like, there's something about this not right.  What if you just make it look like you're doing it, and you walk out of the store?  I'm sure an alarm goes off.  Yeah, there's got to be something in the back that tallies things up and stuff like that.  You think they haven't figured that out?  I know.  Of course they have.  Yeah, they got something.  But all stores will have that.  You won't be asking for help.  You'll just be checking your shit out and walking.  It's going to be like the future is just going to be these empty stores with people walking by.  Boop.  Boop.  Boop.  That's the checkout sound. 
[00:36:30]  And it won't be a phone.  It'll be a...  It will cost...  Oh, go ahead, Jim.  I'll say a you-know-what in your finger.  Yeah.  Like, what, the movies and stuff like that?  Oh, that's just going to come off the little fucking chip with that in your finger or your eye.  A retina scan will take care of everything.  Is this on air or is this a commercial for the iPhone?  Hey, fucko.  It was just announced yesterday.  It's called news.  It's called what's happening in the world, you fucking idiot. 
[00:37:00]  That's right.  Shut up.  Block Bill G.  I...  I get it.  If I see your name fucking pop up, I'm bouncing you.  That's right.  I don't even humor idiots anymore.  I'm long gone as far as humoring idiots.  I used to try to reason with them and talk to them.  It's like, all right, I get it.  You need to just go away.  Look at you.  Goodbye.  Ah, you fucking hillbilly.  Shut up.  It would cost $62 more to make it in America. 
[00:37:30]  The iPhone, supposedly.  Wow.  Per unit?  How much?  62?  62.  It's got to be more than that.  No, 62 more.  To make it.  Oh, yeah.  If they didn't go to China.  China.  That's a lot of money.  That shows me there's a problem there.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Our first problem is, like, treating every human being as equals.  That's right.  Yeah.  China got that shit down.  Cast system.  They realize, look, man, not everyone is, you know, a full human being. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That whole capitalism slash communism thing they've worked out there is really odd.  Talk about an upper echelon and a fucking scum of the earth.  Talk about an economic divide in China.  It's quite amazing.  Which is amazing, considering, see, I want to say something that would really work, but  I got scared.  Oh, why?  The Chinese?  Well, they all, you know.  Oh, boy. 
[00:38:30]  Hold on.  Let me put my finger on the dump button.  It's hollow.  All right.  It's going to write down something here.  That's right.  It's V-H-I.  Considering they all...  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's...  It's so weird that they actually look and go, no.  No, not you.  We see that, no, we're not all...  But you...  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's strange to me.  Well, it can be at times, let's just say.  It's like with both iPhones.  Yeah.  Like, when you look at one iPhone, it's kind of hard to tell it apart from another iPhone. 
[00:39:00]  Which one's my AT&T one, and which one is my Verizon?  Very difficult to tell.  There is a difference.  One is better than the other.  Yes.  Very hard to tell apart.  Yes.  Right.  Oh, but...  Very hard.  The new one, though, will be easier to tell.  Oh, yeah.  Are you going to get it?  You know, of course.  I'm that guy.  It's got the new iOS on it.  iOS 6.  Oh, it does?  Do you save your old iPhones?  Do you get rid of them?  Oh, God, Jimmy.  What are you doing? 
[00:39:30]  That drives me nuts.  I have them in boxes.  Oh.  Why?  Yay.  Oh.  Because I'm sweet.  Because I'm sweet.  It's collector's items.  They're going to be collector's items.  Someday, yeah.  Yeah.  There's only been 30 million of them sold.  You're going to pawn it or sell it.  You know how freeing it would be to just throw that box away?  You'll never turn those old phones on again.  I want to skip it on a lake.  I keep thinking I want to use them as storage devices.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  You're right at this.  Why?  You could buy a fucking...  I know.  It's a hard drive with a terabyte on it.  It's nothing.  I don't want a scary bite. 
[00:40:00]  Ah, I see.  Take us out, you farm animal.  No, we just got here.  You got to deal with union guys, and I'm sorry.  No, I understand.  I'm sorry.  But, you know, the union guys obviously are going to be pro-union.  Well, let's get Anthony on the line here.  Anthony.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hi, sir.  What's happening?  Listen, I think that management takes a pay cut instead of us getting beat up on the labor  end of it.  It'd be a little bit of a way to keep the cost down on making these phones here in the United  States.  That's true.  Management's not really taking big pay cuts, it seems. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I hear you.  I hear you, but, I mean, some of these jobs, these union jobs, I don't know, seems like  a lot of money for something that overseas people are obviously going to get for cheaper.  Crazy.  I agree.  I mean, you can't compete with union labor, though.  Oh, really?  Should I look for the union label when I am buying?  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, I talk to you on my Chinese cell phone.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:41:00]  I drive my Chinese car.  At least the car's American.  Oh, good.  The phone is cell phone.  God bless America.  All righty.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, Mr. You.  All right, so it doesn't sound like the iPhone 5 was an amazing fucking reveal yesterday.  No, they do.  Not a bad reveal, don't get me wrong, but I guess it can't be this wow moment every single  time they announce a new product.  Yeah, that's just it.  It's become something where it's like, all right, you know, when they announced the initial 
[00:41:30]  iPhone, there wasn't one person watching that didn't go, holy motherfuck, this is changing  the entire phone industry.  They still had buttons.  Remember?  Phones with fucking buttons.  And then the iPhone came out.  Everybody was freaked out.  But now, as it goes along, I mean, we're on the fifth incarnation here.  I finally found a phone I'm really happy with.  This Samsung I love.  The S3 I love.  I love it.  Yeah, a lot of people are digging on the Galaxy.  Fucking love it.  I will not be buying an iPhone 5. 
[00:42:00]  As far as phones go, I mean, anything that came out before the Galaxy 3 like that was  just kind of like, all right, I see, it's an iPhone ripoff and stuff.  But that actually, they figured it out.  And it's a bigger phone, but I don't feel like, you know, it's cumbersome at all.  Are the apps, do they work as well as they do on the iPhone?  I don't know.  Because, I mean, my wife's got a, she's got a iPhone.  So, I play with it a little bit.  I like this just the same.  I'm sure, I'm sure the iPhone has more apps. 
[00:42:30]  I like the convenience of going to the app store and on the phone and just being able  to fucking download shit like that.  I've been able to download whatever I wanted.  Yeah, I understand.  As far as apps go.  But I'm not an app guy like you guys.  I hate learning a new OS.  I got apps, but not as much as you guys.  OS, yeah.  I hate learning a new operating system on a phone.  It's like, oh, God.  You're not learning anything.  You're just tapping.  Yeah.  Hey, your toes are still tapping.  You guys do Flipboard yet?  Huh, what?  No. 
[00:43:00]  Flipboard rules.  What the fuck is that?  Just flip through your shit.  Oh, look.  Oh, yeah.  You set up what you want to flip through.  Like, in my case, I got the Facebook, the Twitter.  I got the Flipboard pics, photography, sports, news, pop culture.  And then you go, all right, I want to go popular video.  Let me see what's popular today.  And then you flip through like this until you see something you like.  And then you click and either view it or read about it.  Oh.  Interesting.  Does, uh, iPhone has an app for Flipboard, right? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I'm sure.  I don't know what they have.  I don't know what they got.  Native Flipboard thing.  I like the Flipboard.  I like the maps now.  The 3D maps.  They killed all the native Google apps.  Yeah.  So even YouTube app is not native anymore.  I mean, there is.  What do you mean by native?  I'm not sure what you mean.  Like how, uh, it used to come with Google Maps and YouTube built in like when you bought it.  Yeah.  Now they changed it so Maps is their own app.  They designed it themselves and it's not.  Yeah, it's not Google Maps at all.  And YouTube doesn't come with the phone anymore. 
[00:44:00]  You have to go into the app store and get the new YouTube app.  So what's their version of their YouTube app?  They don't have one.  What's.  Well, you know they're probably going to figure something out, right?  Well, you just go to the app store and download it.  Oh, yeah.  So why is that?  So they want a little.  Because they don't want to be working with Google, obviously.  Okay.  It's Google.  Yeah, they're kind of.  That's the Android operating system.  You're starting to see this encroachment of corporate war going on in this electronic  medium.  Of course.  They won't say it, but.  Yeah, but that's exactly why they're doing it.  Wait, so.  They don't want to promote Google in any way. 
[00:44:30]  So iPhone doesn't have Google Maps?  They have their own version?  Yes.  And what is it called?  Maps.  It's Maps.  And it's a 3D kind of a thing.  Turn by turn.  Turn by turn.  Directions.  Yeah, it's pretty much a navigation system.  It's cool.  On your phone, which is pretty good.  Apple wants to take over the world, and so does Google.  Right.  Yeah.  Who wins?  Apple, I think.  Is this like a Betamax versus VHS shit thing?  Yeah.  Who wins?  Apple's going to work a lot prettier.  Or do they work together eventually?  A lot of fucking money. 
[00:45:00]  But I don't think it's Beta versus VHS.  I think it's more Exxon versus Mobile.  Two of kind of very similar things that are fighting.  And one is not going to completely wipe out the other because it will become obsolete.  But one is just going to be more like higher on the ladder.  That's all.  I like that.  How it lays down.  It's like Getty versus Sunoco.  The map kind of lays down and gets 3D.  Exxon versus BP.  It's pretty cool looking.  I got it, Jimmy.  That's it, huh?  I was thinking more Coke versus Pepsi. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, Coke versus Pepsi.  Go zoom in on that, Sam.  I want to see that.  That looks kind of cartoonish from here.  Yeah, but it's real.  Go to me and Jimmy's houses.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not...  That's not just a screenshot.  See if you can look in the window.  He doesn't have it.  Check out my juicy cock.  It's just a screenshot.  Not the phone.  Well, why don't you zoom in on it, you fucking creep?  Not the phone.  Oh, because you can't use it yet.  It's not out yet?  This is not the phone.  Why can we pre-order it?  Tomorrow.  Oh, good.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow, you can pre-order it.  Good.  Yeah.  And then it comes out on the, what, 21st. 
[00:46:00]  Something like that?  Yeah.  That is pretty good.  Somewhere now.  Wow, that's actually really good.  We got a guy.  Oh, no.  That needs to talk to us, right?  Oh, cool.  Let's get him on.  Frederico.  That's a nice guy.  Hello, Mr. Bimmel.  I'm on the show.  Frederico, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show starring little Jimmy Norton.  Dude, you know what?  You guys are the best.  Listen, I've been listening to you guys for like over five years.  Two times a second, man. 
[00:46:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  And what's up, my friend?  My friend, like, seriously, like, I am holy lit.  I can't believe it, man.  Like, I'm just, like, astonished.  I'm sorry.  I'm just such a douchebag.  But anyways, I just wanted to tell you that, yeah.  Listen, by the way, this frickin', we're all being apt.  We're all being, like, 666.  Everything is being, like, underground. 
[00:47:00]  Like, seriously.  Oh.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Yeah?  Well, we're just being chipped.  What's that?  We're all being fully.  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean by apt, though?  Like, how does it affect you?  Well, we're going to be, like, underground.  Holy shit.  I can't believe.  Like, we're being, yeah, we're going to be, like, like, the government, everything, man.  Like, everything is going to be chipped.  I agree with him. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  The conspiracy terrorist.  Holy crap.  That's good.  That was good.  This guy's zoned it.  Douchebag.  No, you're not a douchebag.  I like what you have to say today.  Yeah, you're making sense, dude.  I think it needs to be said.  What part of Canada, sir?  Alberta.  Oh.  Where's that?  Cali.  Yeah, like.  Is it way up there?  Yeah, like.  And that douchebag, yeah.  I love it.  It's called Sunoka.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  But the thing is.  Yeah.  Like, seriously, like.  Wow. 
[00:48:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Seriously, boys.  Yeah.  We got to be, you know.  You guys are very commercial.  I think we got to be diligent, don't you think?  Rodrigo.  Diligence, yeah.  We need diligence, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before that.  Dillinger.  All right.  Yeah.  Before it happens.  Double guns.  Yeah.  Made out of soap.  You're fucking nutty on a fruitcake.  What do you think?  You know what?  We have to. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You're right.  Yeah.  I think you're right about that.  Good point.  Good point, sir.  You made that point.  We're just reiterating the point you made, because I think you're onto something.  He is.  Go with it, sir.  What else about that?  Well, I just think that we need to be, just be very careful.  Uh-huh.  About the.  I don't know why you're laughing.  You're not wrong.  I think this is a conversation that needs to be said.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like the idea. 
[00:49:00]  Sure.  Or had.  Okay.  If I was talking properly.  No, I don't want to create the negative energy, but I think that we need to understand  that there is definitely a.  A divide?  Going on.  Yep.  Pardon me?  A divide.  Oh, boy.  Why is that a good one?  A divide?  I don't.  It's hilarious.  I don't see the humor in that.  That's funny.  There's an absolute divide happening.  It's funny.  I love it.  All right.  I can't believe I'm on the show. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  We can't believe it either.  You're from the listeners.  Obviously calling it in today.  Okay.  The last thing I can say is that you guys are awesome.  You guys.  I love you guys, man.  You're the best, man.  Thanks for going on.  Thank you.  Frederico, you've been listening for five years.  Yes.  Can I ask you what, because I'm a little confused, what you like about the Opie and Anthony  show?  Oh, what do I like? 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  I love Patrice.  That's a Patrice plug.  Was it Patrice?  I think so.  I'm a little slow on the switch.  You know, that's fine.  Patrice would understand.  Of course he would.  Yeah.  All right.  Time to eat my sandwich.  I want to get a Honey Boo Boo update.  Ugh.  Is Roland here yet?  Pig.  So worry about it.  Pig.  People enjoyed the Honey Boo Boo interview yesterday.  What movie was that?  What?  Remember that guy? 
[00:50:30]  What are you going to do?  Pig.  Remember that guy?  I don't know, but it sounds like Ted Levine, unless it's just, uh...  I don't know who it was, but he was, like, spitting, and it was one of those cop things,  almost like, um, almost like a Dirty Harry kind of a thing.  Pig.  It's just this fucking...  Was it Cobra?  Cobra?  Was it Cobra?  Cobretty?  Yeah.  It's Cobra's coming in.  Pig.  Pig.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  Cobretty.  Oh, Cobra.  Marion Cobretty.  That's terrible.  With the sunglasses and the fucking toothpick.  You're the disease.  I'm the cure.  If the disease is good dialogue, you are the cure for that.  What a cheesedick.  Oh, that was a horrible movie.  Cobretty, get in here!  What has he done this time?  Oh, it's crazy. 
[00:51:30]  Look out.  Look out.  I'll have your badge!  Why would he be allowed to be on the force if he's always fucking up?  Because he always gets it done.  But he gets it done his way!  Yes.  Now I understand.  Hey, well, you know, I'm just doing it my way.  Yes.  Was that Ted Levine?  Do you like when a cop goes rogue?  Watch that.  No.  Oh, a cop goes rogue.  You're not a fan of when the cop goes rogue?  He's a rogue cop.  Doing it his way. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, God.  I don't play by the rules.  He don't play by the rules, but he gets the job done.  And it's always because of something that happened to him in the past.  Yeah.  Man, where he was following the rules and it went bad.  But his wife was murdered.  Yeah, a loved one got killed and he turned rogue.  And now he's taking it out on society.  Oh, God.  I'm rogue.  That's Kenny.  May I comment?  Sure.  The ends must justify the means. 
[00:52:30]  Completely ruining the energy of the bet.  What the fuck?  Completely ruining the energy.  He's saying that in his world.  We had a rhythm going.  No, this is what Kenny...  No, no.  What you just saw there is what he says in the mirror every night before...  This is how he sleeps with himself.  If people want to know how does Kenny live the way he lives, that's at the end of the  night.  Yeah.  Yes, I did this wrong thing to people and that wrong thing, but the end justifies the  means.  The end justifies the means.  Because he was going to hurt somebody.  No, it wasn't Ted Levine in Cobretty. 
[00:53:00]  Was he in Cobretty?  No.  Cobra?  Marion Cobretty.  What a terrible fucking...  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cobretty.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Of course he's a lieutenant.  Oh, yeah.  Because he just, you know, even though he shirks all the rules and he skirts them, he gets  the job done.  Done.  Done.  You want a bad guy taken down, you send in Cobra.  He doesn't sweat.  He just walks around with his shades and he knows where to go and a point. 
[00:53:30]  What else does the road cop do?  I don't negotiate with...  What was it?  Scum or some dumb corn...  Dirt balls.  He said something.  It was terrible.  Cobra?  I don't negotiate with...  What else does the road cop do?  Well, the road cop will actually get his badge taken away.  He only gets it back at the end, begrudgingly.  Here you go, Cobra.  He always has a conflict when it comes to relationships.  He can't settle down.  And you know what?  Don't look for him in a fucking cop car.  Right.  He has his cool personal car that he uses... 
[00:54:00]  Is that the road?  Yeah, look out.  Look out.  Can we watch the trailer for this awful movie?  It's also a new kind of cop.  A new kind of cop.  Cobra.  He does the job nobody wants.  Does it his way.  Sunglasses are on.  Inside.  During a gunfight.  Takes a sip of the beer.  A sip of beer.  Right.  Of course, by the way. 
[00:54:30]  To use unnecessary deadly force.  I used everything I had.  Do you know you have an attitude problem?  Yeah, but it's just a little one.  Oh!  Watch out!  I don't think you'd recognize me if you saw him again.  The tall one?  Yeah.  The one who wants to kill you.  Do what you have to do to get a lead on this maniac.  Oh!  And if I find him, do what you do best.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, God!  Shoot Stella.  Oh, God!  That'd be terrible!  Do what you do best. 
[00:55:00]  He's just throwing bombs into traffic.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  He's firing willy-nilly into crowds.  I hate the match in his mouth.  He's got the match set.  Stallone is...  Cobra.  Cobra.  The strong arm of the law.  Ah!  Oh!  This is humiliating.  Oh, God!  This is terrible!  How embarrassing!  Ooh!  I like it.  He's rogue.  Oh, how terrible.  And then do what you do best.  All right, I'll put on gloves and fight for the 40th time. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, overact.  Poorly.  Say stupid things.  Huh.  Uh, you're the disease.  I'm the gear.  Do what you do best.  Write cheesy dialogue.  He doesn't have a holster.  He just shoves the gun down the front of his pants.  Why?  Because he's the strong arm of the law.  Of course.  Cops always take a sip of the beer.  Yeah.  That's the way it works.  A beer with sunglasses on inside a supermarket as you're having a gunfight with a bad guy. 
[00:56:00]  And he shoots accurately.  I mean, that is the way it happens.  Well, he did have time to have a beer, too.  Do you know how much damage you did out there, Colp Reddy?  As much as...  God damn it, Colp Reddy!  Yeah.  As much as needed to be done.  Yeah.  As much as I needed.  Hey, I got those people out of there!  Hey, I'm hiding a hair lip!  We know.  We know.  God bless.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Good luck to you.  Colp Reddy likes women who shit on tabletops made of glass that he's sitting under. 
[00:56:30]  I like that.  Yeah, I like that a lot.  It's a fetish, but it keeps me relaxed in my topsy-turvy world.  Colp Reddy likes a nice, firm shit.  You're the log and I'm the toilet.  Great.  Just trying to have catchphrases.  They don't work.  Just do do what you do best.  Just do what you do best. 
[00:57:00]  Consume it.  He just turned into shit-eating again.  Of course.  It all goes back to...  Shit-eating.  I like the concept of the rogue cop, though.  Watch out.  Yeah, look out.  Watch out.  He's a rogue cop, all right.  He finds that lady, that special lady, by the end.  Based on the novel Fair Game?  Oh, man.  That must have been a good one.  Based on a novel.  I wonder if it was as bad as Fair Game.  I wonder if in the thing he takes a swig of the beer and he might have cheese-dicked it up. 
[00:57:30]  I bet he cheese-dicked it up.  They made it for Stallone.  Cobra.  Cobra.  Lieutenant Cabretti.  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cabretti is out on the streets.  The irony.  Turning up the scum.  The irony of giving him the name like Marion is amazing.  That's the irony of it, because he's such a man.  You've got to have a man's name.  Yeah, that was the irony of it.  It's like, what's your name?  Wasn't that a whole thing in the movie?  It's like, what's your real name?  And it finally came out Marion, and they all start laughing at him. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, right, but I got a name like a faggot, but I sure as fuck do kick some ass.  Yeah, Cobra.  I love how we could goof on a 30-year-old movie.  Hey, look.  How old is that movie, really?  Oh, man.  This is early 80s, right?  What the fuck year was that?  It's 96.  96.  I actually thought it was.  What year was that movie?  Come on now.  Bridget Nielsen looked good in that movie.  Brigitte.  Oh, 86.  I'm sorry.  86.  Bridget Nielsen looked really good.  Brigitte. 
[00:58:30]  Yes.  I think it was before she did the dikey haircut.  She did look good in that movie.  Fuck yeah.  Her hair was a little longer, I believe.  She, uh...  It's so hard to look at a hot chick back then when you know she looks like shit now, because  you always kind of now see what turned to shit.  Yeah, look, though.  Dude, she was fucking...  It was fucking pretty hot.  Yeah.  Look at those bedroom eyes.  That dumb hat.  Red Sonja.  Yeah, but then she had to...  You know, with the fucking curly locks of the 80s.  But she had to cut it all off and look kind of...  Big hair.  Yeah.  Intimidating. 
[00:59:00]  You know, uh, Cobra, I never thanked you for saving my life.  Hey, shut up there, you legless, nothing worthless fucking shrimp boater.  Hey, Cobra, this is my fat wife, Susan.  Did you drink some beer and shoot her in the face?  Obesity's the disease.  Diet's the cure.  You know, Cobra, I never thanked you for doing such good catchphrases.  This is my friend, stupid, and his wife, Aidsie.  Aidsie's the disease.  There is no cure. 
[00:59:30]  Aidsie's the disease.  There is no cure.  A robe is...  A puppy is a cure.  Aidsie.  Cobretty.  Could you shoot his Aidsie wife and we'll bury her under a tree, Cobra?  Could you do that?  Aidsie.  Aidsie.  That's so an Aidsie variety show. 
[01:00:00]  That's fucking A.  Let's eat.  Let's fucking eat.  We got Big Ann's coming in today.  Really?  She's coming in?  Your old Big Ann.  That's that one from that show.  I don't watch the show, to be honest with you.  I don't either.  Mob-wise?  I guess we'll all learn about it.  Well, it started as Mob-wise, but now she's just...  She's her own thing.  She's got her own show.  Spin-off Big Ann.  They will spin off a fucking reality show these days in a second.  Yeah.  Lickety split, Ant.  It's amazing.  Lickety shit.  And Bob Kelly coming in to say hi today.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, when's Bob in?  Where's Bobby?  So we'll go eat now.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Wasn't that written somewhere in some whore's book?  Yeah, we interviewed the whores from that book, and they claim, according to their book,  that Rocky was into watching girls crap on a glass table while he was under it.  But you know what's better than maybe laying underneath the table, you know?  And like watching the sphincter open up and just dump it out of me. 
[01:01:00]  Oh my God, I'm out of your face!  I'm out of my face, Big Ann!  Oh!  Come on, baby.  Why don't you, you know, open it up and give me one over the glass table.  Oh, yeah, baby.  That's how I like it.  Sloppy.  I didn't start this.  You started this.  Yeah, give me some. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, look at that.  There's some corn in there.  What's that I see?  Oh, look.  I see some peanuts.  Mickey!  She ate peanuts, Mickey!  Mickey!  You know, when a girl squats over your table like that,  you're hoping, you know, it's a nice sloppy dump.  You know, you don't want anything to do.  That's a good one.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, that's a little driver.  You know, I don't know where Adrian went. 
[01:02:00]  Adrian must have left the building.  But, hey, Pauly.  Pauly, get over here and squat on the table, Pauly.  Pauly, squat on the table!  Oh, Pauly!  Give it to me, Pauly!  Ah!  Oh, Pauly! 
[01:02:30]  Big fat ass, Pauly!  Ah!  Ah!  Hey, Pauly, where are you going?  Now who's going to squat over the table?  Hell yeah.  Hey, Mickey!  Hey, Mickey, come on over here.  Squat on the table, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey!  Oh, no, look, it's first blood! 
[01:03:00]  Mickey, you threw first blood!  Not me!  I didn't start this!  You started it!  Ah!  Ah!  Mickey!  Mickey, grab my table, Mickey!  Ah!  Rocky's full of crab now!  Oh, great.  Okay, where's my check? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, whatever.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah!  Okay, terrific.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The O.P.  The Anthony Show.  Out of the bell, fresh out of jail, California dreaming.  Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochie screaming.  Fiending for money and alcohol, for life of a Westside player.  With cows die in a strong ball.  Only in Cali will we riot, not rally to live and die.  In L.A. we wear chucks, not bally.  Yeah, that's right.  Dressed in loaves and khaki suits and ride is what we do.  Flossing but have caution.  We collide with other troops. 
[01:04:30]  Famous because we throw rams.  Worldwide.  Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rose Brams.  Bumping and grinding like a slow jam.  It's Westside, so you know to roll a bell.  I'm a no man.  See what you say?  But give me that bomb beat from Drake.  Let me serenade the streets of L.A.  From Oakland to Sacktown.  In the Bay Area of L.A.  In person.  Right.  California!  I fucking love this song.  Even if you don't like rap, you gotta like this song.  Tupac, 16 years ago. 
[01:05:00]  Wow.  He's only 25.  He would be, he'd only be 41.  He'd been gone a long time, man.  Some say he's not gone.  He would be an OG.  And he's had a better career than most people since dying.  Oh man, still puts out that bad.  How much shit have they put out since he died?  Probably more than before.  Wow, amazing.  Did you guys see the car chase yesterday?  Yeah.  Greatest car chase ever?  Some are saying.  That was a good one. 
[01:05:30]  It was anticlimactic as far as the takedown.  I didn't like the ending.  But in general, it was a good fucking car chase.  You know who has great car chases?  Cobra.  Cobra.  But this car chase, bank robbers, four of them in the car.  And they know they're in trouble.  So they start throwing the money out the car.  They were trying to...  They were trying to get, like, people to just, like, run into the street to get the money.  And then that would fuck up the cops.  The cops that are in hot pursuit. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  The whole gimmick was they were driving around the same neighborhood.  Because they weren't just being nice guys.  They're like, okay, what can we do?  We're fucked here.  Yeah, we're being chased.  Wait, we got this money.  We throw it out the window.  These people will run in the street to get the money.  And then the cops have to fucking stop.  Because they're not going to run over civilians.  They were driving around the same neighborhood.  And more and more people were collecting.  And I think that was their plan.  Right.  Was to throw money out, get a bunch of people congregating in one area, and then you keep  throwing more money out, and they start going into the streets. 
[01:06:30]  The problem with the car chase is that pesky helicopter.  Oh, dude.  How do you outrun the helicopter?  You can't.  You don't.  This other shit, you know, you might be able to figure out something.  But then even when you leave the car, you still got to worry about the dumb helicopter in the air.  Where can you go to avoid the helicopter?  A mall parking lot, like, underground, and then run into the mall?  Oh, a parking garage.  Yeah.  I would think a parking garage would be pretty good.  I don't know.  That's a tough one.  But at some point, you got to leave. 
[01:07:00]  Helicopters just chilling out.  How scared are those guys?  Up in the air.  You just ditch the car in there and then go into the mall.  Yeah.  See, look.  They're just fucking making it rain.  Look at these guys running into the street.  The funniest thing I heard.  It's not a bad plan.  Funniest thing I heard, though, was...  Can you go back to where they threw that money?  I want to hear it.  Yeah.  The news was saying, look, it's illegal to use that money.  So if you did pick some up, you need to go and return that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And they're in the middle of fucking pretty much South L.A. 
[01:07:30]  It's really not the best of neighborhoods.  No.  And you think those motherfuckers are going to be like, uh, yeah, I'd like to return this money.  Yeah, I got like a few thousand dollars.  I want to return it because it's illegal.  And they can't prove that these people knew it was stolen.  Right.  These people did nothing illegal because as far as they're concerned, someone just threw  money out the window.  Do you know what?  There is supposed to be, uh, you don't expect to find that much money on the street.  So you're supposed to assume that there's something illegal about it and return it. 
[01:08:00]  But if they, if they're caught passing those bills, uh, they will be talked to.  But people throwing it out the window.  So the guy threw it out the window.  I thought he was being generous.  And no one's going to check the serial numbers as you're paying for shit.  They'll check to see if the dollar's real.  Yeah.  Not the dollar, but if it's like a higher denomination.  That's a good car chase though.  Went down yesterday.  What?  In the L.A. area?  Yeah.  Uh, down there in, uh, South L.A.  And then a dump truck got him in the end. 
[01:08:30]  Mm.  They got behind a truck.  Yeah, they got behind a truck and he made, he swerved.  Out the windows.  And they have thrown this out.  I kind of root for the, the bank robber in these, uh, situations.  Because it's so fucking cool.  Look at these guys.  You want one to get away.  They're just grabbing cash.  Right.  And you can see that these kids are running out to the car now.  They know where it is.  It's on every television station in Los Angeles.  And now you get kids running out of their house in downtown looking for a little cash.  Man, what a.  Now we're back live.  They just have been throwing the money out there. 
[01:09:00]  That's great.  Back in that area of downtown.  And people know where they are.  And now on top of the bank robbery, we have confirmed that there is a handgun involved in this.  So we know, as the police officers say, they are armed, they are reckless, they are dangerous,  and they have led police up to a dozen cruisers on this high-speed chase at times of 110 miles per hour  for almost one solid hour.  Look at the people on the side looking for the money.  This is great.  The police tell us, Megan, that every time they throw cash out, 
[01:09:30]  they actually have GPS indicators inside the police car and they push a button.  Every time they push money out, they push a button.  And that is location of another crime scene.  Oh, it's marking.  So every place they put money out, they go back and try to get the cash.  Good luck trying to gather up all that cash because a lot of it's down.  You see them throwing something else out back there?  We know there's two people in the car, Megan.  It looks to me like there could be three.  I mean, we know three people.  Look at this shit. 
[01:10:00]  Look at the people running.  And these guys are like, come on, throw it in.  Throw it in.  Throw it in, motherfucker.  Make it rain.  This is downtown Los Angeles, a very impoverished area.  And when you've got people throwing money out, you've got some people that badly want that money.  Look, the helicopter.  You haven't lost the helicopter at all.  And again, we have all reiterated this.  They ain't losing that.  They've gone over and they've run the license plate.  So if this car's not stolen, they know who they're dealing with.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  They will try to contact this guy.  He has a cell phone.  They'll try and contact his cell phone. 
[01:10:30]  Some of them pick up.  Some of them don't.  This is cool.  All of them are desperate.  This is what TV was made for.  Live shit.  Which means that they're going away for a very long time when they're caught.  These guys are being pursued very aggressively because they pose a very big danger.  Why aren't they just blocking a street?  Yeah, it is weird.  The cops didn't even have to put a spike strip down or bump him.  The guy in the silver truck blocked him off.  There was another car over there.  That was the...  Yeah, that's the end of it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, the streets were a little narrow because a lot of these cars were pulled over. 
[01:11:00]  And then, yeah, he just pulled right in there.  Who's that guy?  Stop them.  Is that a guy trying to help out the cops?  Might be.  And when they got out, all the folks were clapping their hands.  And we weren't sure whether they were clapping because the police were apprehending the bad guys or because...  No, that's not why they were clapping.  No, of course not.  You dumb bitch.  In downtown LA.  Look where you are.  You dummy.  South Central, they're applauding the police efforts.  Yeah, the police.  Yeah, of course they are.  Yeah, good job.  Arrest those motherfuckers that were throwing money out the window.  Oh, shut up, lady.  Aren't they just dumb? 
[01:11:30]  They're just dumb.  Oh, God.  We all know what they're applauding.  Of course.  It's obvious what they're applauding.  Oh.  These guys made it rain for the locals before they got caught.  I guess that's a do-gooder that pulled in front of the bank robbers.  It doesn't look like a do-gooder.  That's a fucking big, like, souped-up truck.  Might have been an off-duty guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  Might have been Cobretti.  Cobretti, sure.  Yeah, Cobretti is his own vehicle, so he don't drive no cop car.  Yeah.  I'll block it for you.  I'll unblock it.  I'll go back and get the money. 
[01:12:00]  Wow, there's a lot.  Oh, they came out.  That could have been a situation, man.  Look at that.  There's hundreds of people as arresting these guys.  They had to secure that vehicle really quickly because a crowd of people started getting around it.  And you saw some people looking in the window because they got to assume that there's still a shitload of money in the vehicle.  Well, so they started like zombies walking over to the vehicle.  And after about five minutes, a lot of cops in riot gear came out and started blocking off certain streets and trying to move the crowd along. 
[01:12:30]  That's a good car chase.  One of the better ones.  I would like to know something, though.  Yeah.  That was, what, 11-something L.A. time?  Yeah.  Why were all those people able to just walk out on the streets at that hour?  Shouldn't there maybe be work?  Well, it may have been lunch hour.  No, it wasn't.  May have been.  Those are people that don't work.  They were the burdens on society. 
[01:13:00]  I think it was 10 o'clock our time, though.  Wasn't it?  No, it was like 1-something.  I felt like people were tweeting me early right after the show yesterday.  It was early.  It was in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy.  Wow.  I don't know if he wants to admit this.  Maybe he's already done the fucking time.  Fuck it.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey, I had a boy who, when I was living in Florida.  Lucky you.  Yo, no.  These dummies tried robbing, like, a teller, you know, through the drive-thru of a bank when 
[01:13:30]  they were being chased, pursued by the police.  And my man, like, made it out to, like, the Everglade area, you know, tried doing, like,  the Predator.  That was, like, covering himself in mud because the helicopter, you know, had that infrared  on it.  Oh, yeah.  That ain't gonna work.  Yeah.  No, it kind of did work.  No.  Because it lost one.  But his fat ass got found by a dog.  Wait.  So you know a guy, a friend of yours?  Yeah, yeah.  The big Mexican dude.  He was, like, almost 300 pounds.  They tried.  They were, like, fucked up. 
[01:14:00]  Hold on, hold on.  I'm slowing you down.  So he robs a bank?  No, no, not a bank.  These dummies were trying to break into, like, the ATM in the drive-thru.  Okay, gotcha.  At night time.  So then they had the helicopter on the guy.  He made it to the Everglades in a car?  Yeah, they were close by, like, the Everglades.  They got out running.  And the helicopter was above them.  And this dummy, like, you know, jumped on the side of, like, the bank of the canal and  was covering himself with, like, all the mud.  And apparently it must have started working because the helicopter was, like, off in the  distance. 
[01:14:30]  He thought he got away, but the canine found his ass.  It was, like, biting him up and shit.  That's pretty smart, actually.  Yeah, I know.  It's tough to fucking get away from those helicopters.  Yeah, that's at least a smart solution.  Yeah, I don't even know what you would do in that situation.  He almost did it.  I mean, you know, they said that, according to him, he was, like, not, they didn't find  him for, like, 25 minutes, you know, almost a half hour before, like, the dog got his  ass.  Not bad.  Got his ass.  That'd be a cool reality show.  Dog got his ass.  Trying to get away from the helicopter.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  That's pretty good, but they didn't get nothing either.  They were all just doped up and thought they were going to get some quick money.  Yeah.  That's a crime I understand, though.  Like, guys breaking into an ATM, that makes sense.  Yeah.  Of course I know why you'd do it.  It's where the money is.  Yeah.  It's where the money is.  It's not hurting anybody.  It was actually an off-duty cop that was driving by in the road, in, like, Lake Worth  Road, and, like, happened to see them all around it and called it in.  So I waited for the backup, and by then the helicopter showed up beforehand. 
[01:15:30]  You know, they got about, like, two blocks away by a shopping center before they knew  they weren't going to get nowhere in the car.  So they just all bailed out and just...  All right.  That's just bad luck.  Yeah.  But him being 300 and side pounds is like, you know, everyone else was out.  He was...  That's why they were focusing on him.  Big fat ass.  Pretty amazing.  Getting eaten by the police.  Good story, sir.  Thank you.  All right?  Thank you!  Mikey in Jersey.  So, uh, what? 
[01:16:00]  We're going to spank Libya pretty good?  Uh, I don't know what's going on.  Uh, there's a few warships headed that way.  Yeah, they're going to fucking spank him pretty good, I think.  This is a weird situation, man.  I was reading the paper, they're like, let's spank him, and then get the fuck out of there.  Let's fucking make our point and get the fuck out of there.  But now, but the thing is, like, all right, who did it?  Libyan government didn't have anything to do with it.  There is no government there.  Um, was it just a roving band of thugs? 
[01:16:30]  Or was it a, uh, a well-organized terrorist strike on November, uh, September 11th, uh, the 11th anniversary?  It happened in fucking Egypt, too.  Yeah, yeah, Egypt, too.  They did the same thing, and now, I guess, riots are spreading to Yemen, Egypt, and Tunisia.  Um, what are we doing over there?  Why do we help these shitty countries?  We're giving them billions of dollars, too.  Billions of dollars.  In their rebellion, I mean, I don't think, this is why I'm glad we didn't help in Syria. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  I want no U.S. intervention in Syria.  Like, I don't give a fuck what he does to the, and I know that they're supporters of terrorism,  and he's a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Like, this is what happens when you just, we don't interfere, and you let him just slaughter  his people.  In Egypt, they pulled it off.  We backed him up in Libya like dummies.  Right.  Um, and I guess Gaddafi was kind of a cocksucker for Pan Am.  We had to kill him, but.  Yeah, Gaddafi, but I mean.  Well, they did.  As far as Mubarak goes, like, who gave a shit if he was in there fucking, uh, destroying 
[01:17:30]  his people?  And then they have this Arab Spring.  Everybody's like, finally, democracy's gonna come to Egypt, and it's gonna be great because  there's no more dictator, like Mubarak is out.  And then it just turns into this fucking Islamic fundamentalist government that hates us, hates  America, wants us dead, and is proving it.  They're proving how much they had us.  As we shovel just billions of dollars. 
[01:18:00]  We deserve what we get over there.  Yes.  We don't belong there.  Fucking stop giving them money.  Yeah.  If Israel has a problem with them, Israel is perfectly capable of handling anybody themselves.  We do not belong.  Get our fucking troops and bases out.  Leave.  I don't want to be there.  I don't care if they're being, if they're flourishing.  Good.  Yeah.  If they're being slaughtered by their own fuck.  Good.  It's not my business.  Not our problem.  Four Americans killed, um, in the embassy. 
[01:18:30]  Now, this also is a little odd.  What, how do you have an American embassy in Libya, which is not known as the most stable  of fucking places, even after Gaddafi's gone?  I mean, there's really no working government there.  No.  How do you have an embassy with American personnel in there, and really no American guards?  They were being guarded by these Libyans.  Yep.  Uh, how, how did that happen? 
[01:19:00]  How do you not have some Marines there, uh, guarding that embassy?  I don't get it.  It seems to me like, uh, like they, they left those poor guys with their asses hanging out.  I guess it worked for many, many years.  No, you know what it is?  A lot of times, people don't want to offend.  We can't have our Marines there.  Right.  And, uh, why?  Because it's Islamic?  I am so sick of Islam. 
[01:19:30]  I think everybody is fed up with it.  I'm very fucking tired.  I was having quite the Twitter argument last night with people.  When you look at the amount, I'm not saying all Muslims are terrorists, but I am saying  most terrorists are Muslim.  And, and there, there seems to be a problem there that isn't being addressed.  I'm so tired of these motherfuckers that we are supporting, uh, uh, ripping up the American  flag, which, you know, gives a shit about a piece of material, but the symbolism behind 
[01:20:00]  it, they hate us.  Just stop giving them money.  Stop giving shitty, uh, countries money.  Let them do what they want to do.  If they want to elect the Muslim Brotherhood, let them.  If, if, if the people of Afghanistan do not want to rise up themselves and wipe out the  Taliban, too bad.  Whatever.  Let them be, let their women be de-clitted in the street.  It's not my fucking problem.  We, we give a lot of money to Egypt so they leave, uh, Israel alone, right?  Is that the whole thing over there?  I don't know exactly.  I know we were giving money to, I want to say Lebanon or, or Pakistan to help fund their 
[01:20:30]  children's morning shows.  I guess so the Western ideology is put in there.  But I don't want Western ideology put in there.  Let them live however they want to live.  All embassies are protected by Marines, are guarded by Marines.  Well, apparently not that one.  Uh, I didn't hear.  You know that for sure?  I didn't hear anything.  There wasn't an inkling in the story about any Marines, uh, being at that embassy or engaging,  um, any of the people.  They had private security. 
[01:21:00]  Who accepts that gig?  I mean, like, as a, as an ambassador or a guy working for him?  Yeah.  So, hoping you're going to France or Italy?  Like, no, no.  Libya.  Libya.  So, Mike, the Marine, I know you would know, but, uh, who, I mean, where, where were the  Marines?  Where were they?  Huh?  Huh?  Tell me.  Mike, call the show, please.  Yeah.  Uh, so what happens?  We're going to spank Libya?  What are we going to do? 
[01:21:30]  Uh.  He's sending warships with Predator drones.  Predator drones are flying over.  Obama's got to do something.  He's got to look.  He will.  He's got to look strong.  Yeah.  Got an election coming up.  People want something.  Yeah, yeah.  People want something.  People want something done.  And then, uh, boy, I was switching between Fox and MSNBC last night, and, uh, you would  swear that it was two completely different stories going on with this, uh, embassy  attack.  Um, Fox had it, uh, pretty much concentrating on the fact that, um, there was this, they 
[01:22:00]  wanted to call it an apology, but even I am saying it wasn't an apology by Obama.  It was an acknowledgement that the United States does not stand for people's, uh, the  denigration of people's religious beliefs.  Right.  Uh, that was the first part of his statement.  And then he talked about, uh, there's no excuse for this killing and people with justice  will be served.  Uh, but prefacing it with the fact that we will not stand for the denigration of a religion. 
[01:22:30]  If, if the, what's supposed to have caused this is this trailer for a movie that, uh, is,  is not very flattering to Islam.  Uh, they, they go off, they have a history of fucking killing people that have spoken  ill about, uh, Islam.  Um, uh, that seems to be what at least the diversion was because the saying now it was  a calculated attack.  Right.  And this whole movie thing was just a diversion to bask that it was a real attack.  But what Obama then addressed was, um, that, that they won't stand for the denigration of, 
[01:23:00]  of, uh, a religion, but that's freedom of speech.  What he should have, what he should have concentrated on was freedom of speech.  Right.  But again, when dealing with that savage mentality.  Yes.  Again, when people are going to put the fire out and any group that will throw rocks at  their own women, you have to speak to a certain way.  If you throw rocks at your own daughter, we got a certain way.  Good job.  Yes. 
[01:23:30]  Here's a bigger rock.  But it's like the, the people are killing Romney too.  They're saying he should have just kept his mouth shut.  Right.  Now that's the part that I saw on MSNBC.  You turn over there.  They weren't talking about anything, but Romney speaking, uh, as they said, out of, out of  turn, out of place, um, uh, a little premature.  He might've, uh, started yapping, but they were talking about that.  That would be the huge story on all the papers today would be, um, the fact that Romney spoke 
[01:24:00]  up and I, no, sorry, I don't see it.  Uh, what I did see was both sides of the story being covered on CNN and Fox MSNBC.  I saw Reverend Al and all he was doing was taking the opportunity to lambast Romney, uh,  doing exactly what he said Romney was doing, politicizing it.  And all Reverend Al was doing was politicizing it the other way. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  So, uh, they're just, I gotta say they are scumbags over at MSNBC.  They're terrible.  I understand Fox is, as a conservative, uh, right wing, uh, Republican bias.  Yes, I know.  And CNN, uh, liberal and NBC liberal, CBS liberal.  Uh, but MSNBC is so fucking far to the left.  It's embarrassing.  They're terrible.  It's fucking embarrassing when I watch Hannity or, um, uh, any of the, the afternoon news 
[01:25:00]  shows, I see a pretty good mix of, uh, liberal ideology and conservative.  A lot of the debates that you see on Megyn Kelly show, she has, all right, here's two guys.  Here's a former fucking Clinton, uh, speech writer.  And here's a former Bush advisor and they'll go at each other.  I've never seen a conservative go on MSNBC and be treated, uh, like, like a human being.  That's if you see him at all.  Right.  It's a horribly slanted, tilted fucking network that deserves their no ratings. 
[01:25:30]  I even, like, I'll say that about Romney piping up.  He, I, I have more faith in Obama in this situation than I would in Romney.  I absolutely, I'm not saying Romney wouldn't have good advisors, but I have more faith  because he's proven himself that he's, he doesn't tolerate a lot of fucking bullshit.  Uh, he's much tougher than I thought he'd be over there, so let's see what he does.  Why the fuck were these guys left with their asses hanging out in the first place? 
[01:26:00]  Hold on, we got, why the fuck?  And we got, we got Mike the Marine.  All right.  Who's saying that Marines were there.  Mike!  You told him to call.  Mikey, what happened?  Well, all right, I just wanted to, you know, basically, you know, not say that you're wrong,  but yeah, Marines guard the embassies.  It's actually a unit, it's called MSG, Marine Security Guard.  It's, I've got all my Chinese food.  It makes me bloat, it bloats me.  It gives me headaches.  That's a great place for concerts.  Ah!  Hey!  Oh, shit.  So, where were the Marines at this Libyan embassy?  Where were, I don't know where exactly they were. 
[01:26:30]  Now, when Marines guard the, secure guard the embassies, it's not like a battalion-sized  Right.  group of Marines.  It's a small contingent.  Dude, I, I, I know about this.  That's why I'm wondering why haven't we heard anything about Marines, and we absolutely  would have heard, if Marines had to engage people, we would have heard about that.  These seem to be, uh, four, um, international workers that, uh, our embassy staff that were,  that were killed.  I didn't hear anything about Marines. 
[01:27:00]  Well, let's put it this way.  If I was riding in a car with Jimmy, and we got into a car accident, and we both died, would  I make the front page?  Yeah, the, believe me, if they're being, if they're being, if they're being, uh, is under  siege by RPGs and, and, uh, small arms fire, and there were Marines in that building, you  would abso-fucking-lutely hear that Marines were engaged in some type of, uh, uh, shootout. 
[01:27:30]  You would hear that.  I have not heard anything about Marines being involved in any way, shape, or form at this  embassy.  Why the fuck weren't there, uh, armed personnel at this embassy?  That I don't know.  They should have been.  There should have been.  That's what I'm saying.  Maybe for whatever reason they felt like, like they just didn't need that at that particular  embassy.  That's just it.  No, I'm just asking.  The other side of this.  But bingo.  That's what I'm saying.  That's a bad fucking call right there.  Well, obviously it turns out to be a bad call.  Why the fuck were these guys left like that?  Yeah.  But are, are the embassies, are the other embassies like this? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know, but I bet they fucking buck up security now.  It's on TV right now.  Hold on a second.  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff go to Israel and then tell the world, well, we told  them not to attack Iran.  What we need is Israel and the United States to be totally interlocked to present the United  Front.  Yeah, that's about the, uh, Israel, Israeli situation.  Obama doesn't really want to talk to him.  Um, yeah, but it seems to me, look, I'm not saying blame Obama, blame Obama here.  Who, I'm saying, who is the person that was supposed to have guarded these people? 
[01:28:30]  Why haven't, why weren't people in place to guard?  That's, uh, supposedly sovereign American soil on these embassies that was attacked with  impunity.  That, well, I say, I'll say this, that that's a, that's probably much more of a military,  that's a much more of a military decision than, uh, he probably, he probably even, really?  Oh, you mean like killing Osama bin Laden?  Much more of a military, uh, I think.  Guarding an, guarding an embassy. 
[01:29:00]  There's, there's, there's less emphasis.  There's, a president is less likely to be involved with guarding an individual embassy.  We have embassies in what, a hundred countries.  Yeah, but there's a policy.  There should be a policy in place that says every embassy, especially in these unstable  places, our personnel need to be protected.  Well, maybe there is.  Someone dropped the fucking ball on this.  Yes, yes.  And now sending him warships, that's great.  But how about you do something, uh, beforehand?  Right.  Protect these poor motherfuckers. 
[01:29:30]  These guys were fucked.  You know how fucking petrified they must have been?  Yeah.  A group of savages out in front.  Just an awful country.  But again, and people got mad at me when I Twittered about how there's something to  be said for a dictator.  These guys, you know what?  Exactly.  Assad knows how to deal with the mentality in Syria.  Oh, yeah.  He knows how to deal with it.  Pete knows a little more about this, too.  Oh, thank God.  Hi, Pete.  And Brooklyn, stay on the line.  Mike the Marine. 
[01:30:00]  Pete, what do you got?  Let's go.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  There's been an article in the Daily News.  I know it's not the greatest source in the world, but, uh, they were saying, uh, out  of the four people killed, two of them were Marines.  Ant, comment.  I haven't heard that.  I have not heard that.  Dr. Steve is saying maybe it's the fact that it was a consulate, not an embassy, but still  in Libya, for God's sake, you'd think there'd be security.  No, I didn't hear anything about Marines being killed.  And I think we would have heard, if Marines were, if military, American military personnel, 
[01:30:30]  not any better or worse than American civilians being killed, but it's, okay, scroll down.  Despite, scroll down, I'll leave it right there, Sam.  Despite threats, no Marines guarded U.S. consulate in Libya.  That's what the headline is that I'm reading right here.  Hold on, we got another guy, Paul in Connecticut.  Paul, what do you know?  What do you know, Paul?  I work on a security desk, and basically the information we got yesterday was, number  one, the Libyans were out, there was a first line of Libyan defense force. 
[01:31:00]  They had no weapons, and they ran.  Libyans!  The second line of defense was private security that the State Department hires, plus Marines  were in a five-hour gun battle with these guys.  The four people died of smoke inhalation from the fire that was started.  So no one breached the walls, and that's why they're saying it's an organized terrorist attack,  because they had RPGs and they had automatic weapons.  It was a running gun battle for a long time, and really, all these guys died was because  of smoke.  But I didn't hear that. 
[01:31:30]  I did not fucking hear that.  A lot of people say the two Marines died in this assault.  I work at a commodities desk, and we have oil companies there.  This information came from our guys, because that's where now it's about money.  It's not about anybody's life.  It's just about money.  So, but they said the guy, the diplomat, was suffocated, and they have his body.  So how do they not breach the wall if they have his body?  They don't have his body at all.  The body was taken from the embassy to a Libyan hospital to be resuscitated.  Oh, I thought that, you know, I'm sorry. 
[01:32:00]  It's my fault.  I thought that was a mob scene.  They don't show faces.  No, he was transported by ambulance to be resuscitated.  There was no, you know, and then if you go on to the BBC, you can talk to the, uh, one  of the attending physicians is there, and he talks about there was no marks on his body.  There was no other trauma.  It was strictly suffocation.  We call it smoke inhalation.  They call it suffocation.  Yeah, they're calling it that for, to me, to make the story seem...  They were trapped in a fucking room.  Yeah, I'm not saying that it's a good death, but smoke inhalation sounds like a less menacing 
[01:32:30]  death than suffocation.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So thank you for clearing that up.  Mussolini, the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And the information we're getting, too, is that he was in there.  He really didn't have to be there.  He was in there, and there's questions about whether he was destroying documents, why he  was there, because he came from the outside in.  He was not on campus.  He came back in when the protesters showed up.  Sure.  Now, where were they in the...  What kind of room were they in that the smoke was so bad? 
[01:33:00]  I don't have a way out of the thing, but they were inside the building.  The building went up like a match.  If you look at those pictures, everything burned.  So these guys came in RPGs, and I don't know what the interior was like, but I don't know  if it was a building that they took over, or we built it.  That's the other question.  Who built the building?  Because this thing, if you look at the pictures today, this thing is gutted.  Okay, but they never breached the wall.  They never got inside.  They did.  Okay.  I didn't hear anything about Marines. 
[01:33:30]  I'm still not fucking buying the Marine angle, sir.  A few people saying two were killed.  Marines guard embassies, man.  I'm not...  Every Marine contingent.  There's Marines in every embassy you want.  Until I see the names of the people and their fucking... what they are, I'm still holding... I'm holding back what I am willing to believe here.  I want to know who died in this embassy.  I heard four people.  I did not hear anything about Marines. 
[01:34:00]  They're all State Department employees, but the... you're not going to get... the spin right now is Libyan's bad, American's good.  They're not going to sit there and say, oh, the Marines killed 15 before... that part of the story is not going to come out for a while.  I didn't hear anything about any of the protesters being killed either, sir.  I didn't hear anything about that.  No fucking way.  Well, we look at MSNBC is concentrating on...  Exactly.  It's not surprising you didn't hear it, or Fox and them are concentrating on their nonsense.  All right.  You can run BBC in the background.  You'll get some more information on BBC.  Thank you, buddy. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  Very much.  Shot to death.  All right.  CBS is reporting... let me see.  This is from Adam in London.  London.  That Ambassador Stevens suffocated to death while two Marines and an embassy staffer were shot to death?  Is that what...  Is that it?  I mean, it's just Adam texting it, but...  Do you have something there, Sam?  Young Sam?  I got a link to a CBS article saying two Marines were killed.  Yeah, I've read security personnel.  Security personnel? 
[01:35:00]  Hey, uh...  Wow.  That's fucked.  Maybe Marines guard it, but maybe the U.S. doesn't make it a public...  Maybe they don't state it publicly, but it's just...  That's the security they're talking about.  Who knows?  Man.  Why don't we go to Tom?  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Tom.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes?  How can you defend Obama's foreign policy when the first thing he was doing was apologizing for Bush? 
[01:35:30]  And now, look what's going on in the world.  I'm not saying he's...  Hold on.  I'm not saying he's handled...  They've burned effigies of him.  They've always...  They did that with Bush.  They did it with Reagan.  They do it with every Western...  It's what they do.  They burn effigies.  I understand that, but he was supposed to be, you know...  Well, can I answer your question?  He was supposed to bring everybody together, and has he?  You said, how do I defend Obama's foreign policy? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  The part of it that I like is that he has been harsher on the Middle East than I expected him to be.  He's been harsher on Israel.  He's been harsher on the Middle East.  Yeah, he has been harsher on Israel, but he's been harsher on Islamic terrorism than I thought he would be.  And you know what?  When I'm dealing with this country, I'm tired of every other country being lumped in.  Israel can...  I'm very supportive of Israel.  They can handle themselves.  I don't expect our... 
[01:36:30]  Hold on.  Our foreign policy doesn't have to be dictated, because Israel is having problems.  They don't need us.  They don't need our permission, and we don't need to tell them what to do.  Right now, we're dictating Israeli policy, to tell you the truth, because they absolutely want to do something to Iran.  They want to do something about their nuclear capability.  And we're pretty much the ones telling them, no, you've got to hold off.  They want to do it, like, yesterday.  But I think...  Well, is it so much that they want us to dictate it, or do they want somebody to have their back? 
[01:37:00]  Maybe.  They don't want to be left in the wind.  Well, yeah.  Maybe, but they have to make that decision.  But you would hope your allies are going to be there if you're going to pull a huge military move, like maybe bombing some of these nuclear sites.  And do you think Obama's going to have Netanyahu's back?  No.  No, and I don't know if I want him to.  As much as I...  I want him to.  No.  I'm tired of being mixed up in that fucking mess over there.  I'm tired of the U.S. being mixed up in that mess.  I'm sick of it. 
[01:37:30]  It's not our fucking business.  All we do is put our dumb red, white, and blue fucking noses in everybody's ass.  Enough.  Can we just mind our fucking business?  What happens the next time they slide a plane into our building?  You don't do anything?  No, but that's our business, dummy.  If it's our building, it's our business.  Where do you...  Where are these people coming from?  They're coming from...  Saudi Arabia, most of them.  So...  So what do you do? 
[01:38:00]  Cut ties with Saudi Arabia.  Drill in Alaska, cut ties...  And work on alternative...  I agree with you with that.  Work on alternative energy and cut ties with fucking Saudi Arabia.  Fuck the house of Saud.  Let them fall.  Let fucking Kuwait fall.  It's not our problem.  That's not an easy fix, though.  That would take years.  It would.  To separate from those guys.  But I'm tired of everything...  We are well connected to them.  I'm just tired of it.  I'm sick of us being mixed up in that shit.  We're in a tough spot, because you can't just say goodbye to Saudi Arabia anytime soon. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, I know, but it would take years.  Yeah.  But I'm just sitting there.  It would be self-sufficient from that situation.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Ah, yeah, Tom.  Thank you.  There you go.  So, warships on the way.  Something will be done.  Warships on the way.  Yeah, something just going on.  Lob some shit and get out of there, maybe?  Where do you lob it?  I don't know.  It's just it.  These are weird mob-like things, and again, if Al-Qaeda was involved in some way, shape, 
[01:39:00]  or form, and it was more of a calculated attack, what do you do?  You lob fucking shit in on who?  That's why a lot of this shit happens, and there's just nobody to really concentrate your  anger and aggression on.  Well, Obama's got to handle this one properly.  We'll see what he ends up doing.  This is a very big test for him, especially so close to an election.  How he handles this, and believe me, just as Romney was politicizing it, both sides are 
[01:39:30]  absolutely looking at this situation, and whether they do the best thing for the country  and the situation, or the best thing to help their chance at being elected, and I'm talking  about both sides here, that'll show who more of the true patriot is here, because if you  don't think President Obama is basing his decisions on what is going to help him in  November, you're a fucking idiot. 
[01:40:00]  If you think he's just such an American that he will only do what is best for the country  and not what might make him look a little better for re-election, you've got to be a  moron.  Yeah, I think most people know that.  No, I don't think so.  I think most people that listen to our show know that, I guess.  Well, maybe.  Yeah.  I think there's a lot of people that absolutely think, no, he'd put that aside, put that aside  on like his Vegas fundraiser?  Oh, that's right.  He went to Vegas.  There's not a president alive that would put that shit aside. 
[01:40:30]  No, of course not.  They would politicize it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So is Romney guilty of this too, and you're still electing him?  He's guilty of politicizing it.  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  But no more than the other side is.  So shut the fuck up.  There, I'm admitting it.  Wow, look at me.  Good for you.  What are you admitting?  And Romney isn't the president. 
[01:41:00]  So there you go.  All right.  We'll break here.  We got the big Ange coming in at 9.30.  Oh, boy.  And the big ass coming in at 8.  And the big ass is up next, Bob Kelly.  How's he doing?  We'll find out, I guess, right?  He's sick.  What do you mean?  I just wanted to stop the show.  He's fine.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:41:30]  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  What's that?  Can we interview you for Chippa TV?  It's talking to people at Comic-Cons.  What's your hat supposed to be?  Supposed to be the mushroom head for Toad.  The mushroom?  Uh-oh.  Like magic mushrooms?  Like you're going to get zooted or something?  Yeah, or magic brodies, right?  I got so fucked up one time.  I was smoking reefers and doing Mary Janes and whatnot.  And my friend's like, you want to do mushrooms? 
[01:42:00]  I'm like, fuck that shit.  No, it's just at that point, you're just like, no.  Maybe later.  Yeah, I get too zooted.  I just get fucking crazy, you know?  Fucking throw shit at the cops and whatnot.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Makes sense, yeah.  So, how's your Comic-Con?  So far, so good.  I'm trying to meet girls, make friends.  Where's your boyfriend?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Oh, that's nice.  You want to go out for some pea soup or something?  I got to go meet up with my cousin.  She's an artist.  What the fuck?  She's an artist here.  Damn it. 
[01:42:30]  Where are you from?  I live in France.  Oh, what brings you here from France?  Oh my God, look at that guy's bulge.  That's the biggest pecker I've ever seen.  I like you.  Where's your boyfriend?  He's walking around here somewhere.  Shit.  I got to go before he gets mad.  I thought I was going to get that, too.  God damn it.  I can't get no puss here.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  Fucking home run, Chipperson. 
[01:43:00]  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to say hi to Bob Kelly.  I haven't seen him in a while.  What's up?  Last couple times you were in here, I wasn't around.  Bobby.  Yeah.  What's that?  Bob is here promoting the Irvine Improv tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Bob is here strictly to promote my game.  No, no, no.  Ouch.  Thank you, Bob.  I'm here to promote Levity Live this Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
[01:43:30]  That means tonight.  Brand new club.  Yeah, I went there for a brewer's show.  Was it good?  It's a cool place.  Is it?  Nice.  Nice.  All brand new and the seats.  Kind of, I don't know, like almost a theater feel.  No shit.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  Everyone has a good view.  Really?  Yes.  How big is it?  I don't know.  Like 50 people?  7,000.  Between 50 and 7,000 people.  Yeah, between 50 and 7,000 people. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, man, why aren't we going fucking fly fishing?  Let's get that out on the table.  October.  Are you going?  October.  Which is a dumb little boat.  Did you see my boat?  I saw your boat.  Dingy.  It's called the Sea Eagle, by the way.  The Sea Eagle.  You got a Sea Eagle?  It's the Sea Eagle, the...  You got a fly fishing boat, or is it for all types of fishing?  You can do all types of fishing.  It's...  Let me look at the Sea Eagle.  Sea Eagle pontoon.  Oh, that's what it's...  That's the...  You got a fly boat.  Wait.  That's it.  Get the exact boat. 
[01:44:30]  You got one of those?  That's it, right there.  Right there, yeah.  I don't see a seat for me, Bob Kelly.  That's a one-seater.  It's a one-seater.  But you get your own.  They're very cheap.  Oh, you play bumper boats.  And you...  That'd be fun.  But I like when we're on this.  Look at that.  You can stand up.  Oh, man.  He looks like he's ready to fall.  You can see that he's ready to fall.  That's because he's got a 10-pounder on the line.  Look at that.  Dude, no way.  He's using all his balance to make sure he doesn't fall in the river.  He was really trying not to fall.  That was a bad commercial for the Sea Eagle.  Oh, I like this.  The Sea Eagle is unbelievable.  You bring your kid out, you go fishing. 
[01:45:00]  It's a Cadillac of fly fishing boats.  Cadillacs of fly fishing boats.  You've got to blow it up.  You blow it up.  Honest to God, two and a half minutes.  With a pump.  You blow it up.  Oh, it's an air mattress for the water.  That's great.  The whole thing.  You don't blow it up with your mouth.  I have the swivel seat that Norton broke the first day I got it.  What?  I didn't mean to.  No, I didn't.  What, did you swivel?  Snapped off.  There's a little...  It folds up.  You can take everything...  This sounds like a horrible boat.  It's the best boat ever.  If Jim Norton is breaking it on day one...  I didn't mean to.  He handed me something.  I didn't know how to carry it.  Sorry, I don't have a fucking Sea Eagle pontoon boat. 
[01:45:30]  I love you get angry like your parents are yelling at you.  I didn't mean to.  That boat looks horrible.  It's the best thing.  It really does look horrible.  It is the best way to fish.  I know.  Ever.  It's the number one boat out there for fly fishing.  First of all, I don't see a seat for myself.  First of all, I got you your own, lad.  How are we going to socialize with a one-seater?  I got you your own.  I'm going to have to yell, hey, how you doing over there?  You don't yell what we're flying for.  You know better.  He says it's the best birthday present I ever got.  That's what I say, too. 
[01:46:00]  Look at his dimple.  Wait, how did Jimmy break the boat?  It was in your house?  Yeah, what happened?  Everything comes off.  That's horrible.  And you got to assemble it when you're there.  I hate your smile.  Dude, doesn't it get all fucking...  No, but it is.  I'm not even like...  It just sounds horrible for real.  I know what you're trying to go for.  When you sing your sentences, Ope, I know you're lying.  But it does.  But I'm not lying in this case.  It's horrible.  I swear to you, I'm not.  This is the best sounds horrible.  The best boat ever.  Where do you store it?  Doesn't it get all seawater, like lakey-smelling and dirty?  No.  Lakey-smelling.  Could we slow down a little bit? 
[01:46:30]  Why did Jimmy break your boat?  Where was it?  Take that fucking hand off there, Sam.  Move the mouse.  I hate the hand.  I hate it, right?  But I want to know why you broke his boat.  The day I got it, we were putting it in the car because it all folds up in a bag.  At Gnome's house.  And it all folds up into like a backpack, so you can just take it to the river, throw  it in your trunk.  Yeah, boom.  And that seat folds up, and there's a leather thing that goes across.  It keeps it shut with a button.  Okay.  And you're not supposed to hold.  It keeps the seat shut.  Not a button, like a button. 
[01:47:00]  It's like a button on your shirt, but it buttons to keep it shut.  Snap.  Snap.  Horrible.  And Jimmy, I said, Jimmy, he goes, can I help?  I go, take this to the car.  And he grabs it by the hand.  He made a handle out of it.  Oh.  And he ripped off.  It should have been rugged enough.  I agree.  Yeah, it's for the outdoors.  It should be rugged.  It's a fucking boat.  It's not a handle, Jimmy.  How do you break a boat by carrying it?  It's not a handle.  I didn't know that.  It was a seat closer.  I didn't know that.  You know what?  I don't like this boat at all.  I hate it.  It's the best boat ever.  Have you used it?  I've used it.  Look at him trying to row. 
[01:47:30]  It stinks.  He looks like he's going to tip over at any moment.  The Sea Eagle pontoon is the Cadillac of fly fishing boats.  Exactly.  Have you used it?  Cadillac wood.  What?  I love that boat, Jimmy.  Have I used it?  Yeah.  And you should end up like they did good times in the Cadillac.  Or like Fredo in the Godfather 2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I say Hail Marys.  I hope I pull a pizza out.  I'm right with the fucking fat jokes.  I'm trying.  Oh, Bobby.  I'm trying to talk right out of the gate.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm trying to avoid all that today. 
[01:48:00]  I'm going to do something different today.  Listen, it's the best boat out there.  You used it in New Hampshire when you were up there?  Five times by myself.  How was it?  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  The reason why boats like this suck is that you have to throw it on top of your car, tie  it down, all that shit.  He's showing that you can fucking fish on one foot and not tip over.  It's really stable.  You can't really tip it.  You can put a motor on it.  Look at this.  Watch that.  He's standing on one edge of the boat.  Sure.  Yeah.  Where's that kid who he gave it to for his birthday?  Get him on the boat.  Pull his pants down. 
[01:48:30]  Get the water.  What this boat is saying to me is you're making it loud and clear.  You don't want me fly fishing with you anymore.  No, but I don't see a seat for me.  I have two.  There's a double seat that goes in the front.  We face each other.  Really?  That sounds great.  You know, remember the river we went down?  Yeah.  Remember the river?  Are we going down that river?  You can go down that river in this.  It's a class A wrappers.  I'll hang with Rich.  Yeah, you can.  Rich liked you better anyways.  It'll be me and Rich and then you could be in your whatever the fuck, your fucking  robot.  It's a sea eagle. 
[01:49:00]  It's called a sea eagle.  It's called a queer carrier.  Frameless.  A queer carrier.  Where are you going?  Are you going to shit?  Yeah.  It's going to go shitties.  I haven't read before, so I wasn't able to go.  I love when it has to shit.  Why?  It's got a shitties.  It just makes me happy.  Come on.  Bob, we're not doing the thing in Roscoe this year?  Yeah, but we're not going to use boats up there.  You're walking the river.  No, we're going with Rich again.  I don't think so.  You don't like Rich?  I love Rich.  I've been in touch with Rich ever since.  I love Rich.  Rich is a great guy.  What do you do to you? 
[01:49:30]  But why did you say you're not going with Rich?  I said we go up, we walk the river.  We're not going to do the boat thing.  We didn't catch anything.  I know, but the water was high, remember?  Yeah, we didn't catch a thing.  Water was high, which means they had to stay low.  It was eight hours of not catching anything.  So let's give him another shot.  I said we go to the river where we caught things.  There was a lot of rain that came in.  That was a year ago.  You even said the level of the river was way too high to fish that day.  We could have found a spot to go in.  I go with Rich.  I have confidence in Rich. 
[01:50:00]  Go with Rich, and you can pass me on the way.  But I want to go with you too.  No, we're not going with Rich.  Then what are we doing?  We're going to go.  We're going to go in your little rowboat.  First of all, we've got to get a place to stay, because you've ruined that.  I didn't ruin that.  You did.  How did I ruin that?  Because you had to make a video of the poor dirt garden, and then tell everybody how much  the place sucked, and then we had to go back up there, and then you had to expose her again.  No, I didn't expose her.  She was waiting for us to come.  She waited a year to confront me. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, because you understand, she's a little eight.  Do people understand that?  We did that whole thing last year.  But basically, we tried to check into our spot, me and Bobby's spot.  Well, you have to put bug spray on the pillow.  Right.  And she remembered the video I made the year prior, and couldn't wait for us to come back  so she could give me a talking to.  Well, you know why?  Because your video, whenever you typed in the Roscoe Motel on Google, the first thing  that comes up is the most popular.  Yeah, the most popular thing.  I got the most popular video out of Roscoe in New York?  40,000 hits on that thing. 
[01:51:00]  Nice.  You made a miniseries of Lonesome Dove.  Nice.  People like our miniseries that we've done together.  People would show her that.  I know.  In a poor hotel.  Remember, she had a picture of me.  She was just waiting.  Yeah.  I was on her desktop.  You were denying it.  For a year.  Yeah.  Well, we could stay in the other place with the roosters.  I can't stay.  That was a nightmare.  No?  No, it was like an old haunted house.  And don't we have to go soon?  Isn't it like prime?  October 15th.  That seems late in the season, Bobby.  October 15th is the last day you can fish, I think. 
[01:51:30]  I will absolutely have a second kid by then, too.  So, October 15th.  You're already having another baby.  Where have you been?  You're not my friend anymore.  What's wrong with you?  I know she was pregnant, but I didn't know it was coming now.  Any week.  Oh, my God.  I'm down at any...  It could happen right now.  All right.  Keep it on the QT, would you?  Whoa.  We're over eight months pregnant.  It's happening.  It's going down.  That was the countdown on my website, by the way.  I tricked everybody. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  You have a website?  Kind of.  What the hell is your website?  It's just OP Radio.  It just links everything.  Dot com?  Oh, yeah.  That's all it is.  It's nothing special.  That's the...  You had a countdown?  Yeah, people thought it was for our contract, but that was for my wife's pregnancy.  What kind of page is that?  Who did that?  I got a guy.  I like it.  It's just basic shit.  It's got my Twitter feed over there.  It's got my Instagram over there.  Get off me, Edgar.  It's got my YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter links over there. 
[01:52:30]  Nice.  And then it's got my latest videos kind of right there, front and center.  Let me see.  What is that?  A Say Now page?  And then a couple...  It's sort of in the...  It's sort of like a Say Now, but it's not Say Now.  And there's me with a young Sam Kinison with my Bill Cosby sweatshirt.  Sweater.  All right, look.  I was young.  You don't have a Sam Kinison picture, so don't make fun of me.  You had that sunflower hairdo?  What do you mean?  Just that sunflower burst in the front.  What do you mean? 
[01:53:00]  Right in the front there.  Like the bangs went down to the left, to the right, and to the back.  That's how people wore their hair back then.  What am I...  No, not everybody.  What do I see it, Sam?  You're not holding a watch.  Not everybody.  What do you mean, not everybody?  I could show you a million fucking guys with that same haircut.  Yeah, you could.  Gee, fuck.  They'd probably be in a parade, too.  Bunch of Peter Pumpers, right, Bobo?  Yeah.  Fucking home run, Kelly.  You're all right with the sweater?  You're all right with the sweater in that shot? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  What is that?  What is that?  A little Tello sweater?  It's a horrible sweater from the Times.  Yeah.  Horrible.  Yeah.  I like the sweater.  It's not bad.  I wish I could Photoshop the sweater out.  Why?  Because then my Sam Kinison picture would be a little cooler.  Just a little cooler.  I think the sweater's great.  I think it's fantastic.  What is he wearing?  It's a horrible sweater.  He's wearing fucking...  What's he wearing?  I can't even tell anymore.  Did he die in 91 or 92?  Somewhere around there.  I think 91, right?  Somewhere around there.  It's been 20 years already. 
[01:54:00]  Were you friends with him?  No.  No.  I was just starting out in radio, and I got to meet him.  Look at that seagull.  Met him a couple times.  He was a really nice guy.  When he was yelling and screaming.  Was he different off?  Was he different off radio?  He was a fucking human being, man.  Just a regular dude?  Yeah.  He cared about people.  Absolutely.  Really?  I think so.  Yeah.  Anyway, back to the fly fishing boat.  I met him once.  Did you meet him once?  Talked to him at Rascals.  He came in and talked to a couple of the comedians, me and my buddy.  Talked to him for about five minutes, ten minutes, and he signed a napkin for me. 
[01:54:30]  I didn't get pictures back then, but I got to address.  Rascals.  From the South in Ocean Township.  The famous Rascals.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, Bob, you got Levity this weekend starting tonight through Sunday.  Levitylive.com.  It's West Nyack, New York in the Palisades Mall.  Yeah.  It's a great spot for comedy.  Yeah, I'm excited.  And they got the mall, so you can do some shit, too.  Yeah, I'm excited to be there.  You should be.  I like it up there.  I like the peeps.  How's your voice?  It's bad.  What the hell's going on?  I don't know, dude.  I lost my voice two months ago in Vegas when we went to Vegas. 
[01:55:00]  For the MMA?  For the MMA.  Were you yelling at the event?  No, we didn't yell.  We didn't do anything.  Maybe it popped something.  Nothing.  I don't know what I did ever.  Have you been checked?  I've been checked.  No polyps, no nothing.  And I just haven't been able to get it back.  There's no lumps in your throat?  No lumps.  Oh, you know, throat cancer at least.  That's good.  Thanks.  Maybe it's a reflux.  So what are they saying it is?  Probably a reflux.  You get acid reflux?  Yeah, but I've been taking my pills, so I haven't had it.  But when that acid comes up, it does some damage, man.  Yeah.  It might be something like that.  I don't know.  I can't get my voice.  I keep losing it, but I've been gigging constantly. 
[01:55:30]  So I have shows every week, so it's fucking, I keep, I get to learn how to do my act differently  or something and not scream or I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  Sounds a little weird right now.  Yeah, it's like a little tranny, right?  It's a little deep.  A little deeper.  Yeah, man.  It could be like a boss jock.  Bob, your voice is your instrument.  We've stopped touching me.  I'm just trying to make a point, Bob.  Yeah, but I don't like that every character touches me.  He's just trying to make a point.  This is a character.  Get off me with the fingernails.  See, that's the character. 
[01:56:00]  That was Jimmy showing concern.  When you want to show a little extra concern, you fucking touch the guy's arm.  Do you pinch him with his fingernails?  No, that was the character.  That's what he was trying to tell you.  You should give that a check.  There's two different things.  Can you button that shirt, please?  Is it like my belly sticking out?  I don't like seeing your belly.  I don't like seeing a grown man's belly.  It's uncomfortable.  It's me.  It's bringing up feelings.  Yeah, is it weird to see it without hands on your head?  Yeah.  I like seeing that.  Wait, there's something else I was going to ask you.  The voice, the thing.  There was something. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, fuck.  What was it?  Oh, the TV show.  What's up?  It's in FX's hands.  So you're still waiting for them to decide?  It takes a long time.  They got to do notes.  They got to do edits.  They got to do producer edits.  For the people, you've filmed a pilot for FX.  It's huge.  Yeah, there's so many people do edits and notes, and then FX has to do their thing, and then  I think they have to test.  Focus groups.  Yeah, they do all kinds of weird shit.  What do you think?  What are you hearing so far?  Anything?  So far, FX had some good notes, and they're smart people, so they know what they want, 
[01:57:00]  which is good, and they liked the last one, so I don't know, dude.  I'm kind of staying away from it.  You obviously don't know anything.  Because I'd rather fall off the second floor of Hope than the tenth floor.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  Because you've been there so many times.  This is the best thing.  This is so good.  People tell you how wonderful it is.  You start buying fucking real estate and better clothes, and then all of a sudden, it's just  gone. 
[01:57:30]  How was this shit?  It feels like a prison rape that came sliding out.  It feels great, huh?  No, it was like burning.  I think I went to Chipotle.  I went to Chipotle.  Oh, my God.  Chipotle rules.  Last night.  But that shit is spicy.  Chipotle.  Was that shit facing the wall?  Dude, it was so spicy.  Oh, what a spicy shit.  They had to get their mild salsa, which is still spicy.  It was fucking crazy.  That's the problem with the Chipotle.  What's that?  You go Chipotle.  I love Chipotle.  It feels like I got a suppository put in, coated in Vicks VapoRub. 
[01:58:00]  Yikes.  Ow.  That's good food, though, man.  I love Chipotle.  It's really fresh.  I love Chipotle.  What's that?  Chipotle.  Three soft tacos.  That's where I go.  Really?  I go with the burrito bowl.  That burrito's nice.  I like the burrito bowl.  I had the burrito.  You go brown rice or white rice?  White rice.  Black beans or the pinto beans?  Black beans.  What kind of chicken?  Or do you go beef?  That's shredded.  Shredded beef.  Yeah.  Shredded beef.  Oh, chicken. 
[01:58:30]  I do three soft tacos.  I do shredded beef, two shredded beef, and one pork.  I don't know how the burrito put itself back together and came out my ass full size.  We ate at one in L.A., and that's when RuPaul was sitting at the table behind us as what?  Just as a guy.  As him?  Yeah.  As RuPaul.  He goes through life as a guy.  Deep-throating the burrito.  He goes through life as a guy that hasn't shaved.  That's his look.  I'm serious.  Every picture I've seen, that's what you see.  Yeah.  It freaks me out how he can really just turn into a hot black chick with hips. 
[01:59:00]  You think that's hot?  Really?  Yeah.  It's so obvious a trend.  I'm 41, and I've been married for five years, so my hot meter is getting my hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  The bar's a little lower.  God, that's way lower.  That's just a dude.  Yeah, that's a dude, but go to the girl version.  All right, go to the girl version of RuPaul.  Let's try to have an open mind here.  Please.  All right, now go to the bar.  I have an open ass appearance. 
[01:59:30]  That's no.  Look at how hot she is.  She's wonderful.  Oh, God.  That's so fucking retouched.  And I don't know how they do the boobs in such a way that she has cleavage.  Yeah, they tape and makeup.  Okay, this one I wouldn't do right down there.  No.  No.  That'd be funny.  She should do a movie dating herself.  That sounds like an Adam Sandler movie.  Sounds wacky.  That's an Adam Sandler movie.  What are you doing?  Tyler Perry.  Adam Sandler. 
[02:00:00]  Put that together.  That's funny.  Tyler Perry's I'm Dating Myself.  He kind of does it, though.  See, look, he's dressed as Michelle Obama and Obama.  Oh, is that what it is?  You can't tell that's what that is.  Is that true?  I heard the best racist joke ever.  Oh, when did I tell it?  The emcee that was hosting this weekend, this past weekend, he goes, I saw twin black guys  or I'm just really racist.  That's very funny. 
[02:00:30]  That's not bad.  Wow.  What the fuck is that?  RuPaul looks like he has AIDS.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't?  Look.  No.  That's not a skinnier older gentleman with a nice hat.  Is that it?  It's, uh, I don't know.  Did we ever have him on?  AIDS, you don't get thin anymore, dude.  Oh, yeah.  That's like 80s AIDS.  That's 80s AIDS?  We're in 2000.  Yeah, 2000 AIDS.  You just get a pot belly and fat fingers.  That fucking, uh, what's his name? 
[02:01:00]  McMillan and Wife there.  Rock Hudson AIDS.  That was bad.  Yeah, that's 80s AIDS.  Oh, man.  That is such 80s AIDS.  Because nobody, no one had seen Rock Hudson in a while, so everybody was like, oh, yeah,  from McMillan and Wife, that guy, from fucking the movies.  And then he came out for something and they were like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  That was when everyone went, oh, AIDS, oh.  Well, a lot of people, they'd come and tell you, like, that it was a virus and nobody knew  what it was.  The doctor can't do anything about it, Forrest. 
[02:01:30]  They can't do anything about it.  So I guess I should just have to have sex with you now so I can get it.  Yeah, you dummy.  I buried her under the tree.  I used a straw as a coffin.  Forrest, why isn't she wearing shoes in the grass, Forrest?  She's going to kill the lawn.  With her AIDS-y feet.  Forrest, her toenails.  Or digging into the grass.  I don't want her to get AIDS on it, Forrest.  I love this Gary Sinise.  It's fucking great.  It's right on.  They're titanium. 
[02:02:00]  I'm not worried about my feet because they were blown off in Vietnam.  But I'm worried about my fatty wife, Susan's feet.  Forrest, you killed all the corn.  You buried her in the ground and ruined the soil.  You gave AIDS to the fucking grass.  Now you have AIDS corn.  It pops on the fucking stalk.  You don't eat it, you shove it in your ass.  Oh, there's 80s AIDS right there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when Rock Hudson came out. 
[02:02:30]  It was like, what's wrong with Rock?  That's just fucked up.  Rock Hudson, if he wasn't famous and didn't have the money, was just a redneck.  Look at that.  He was just a hillbilly.  Oh, you think?  Look at that.  Look at the one on the right.  He got real AIDS-y.  Yeah, he got AIDS-y.  He's all jaundice-y.  All AIDS-y.  AIDS-y.  What is going on with you, Bobby?  What's up?  Give him the big update.  Bad Boys, maybe a sitcom.  Not a sitcom.  Maybe a TV show.  Yeah, TV show.  Fly fishing boat for one person.  Nice.  Love the idea of that fly fishing boat. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, it's the best.  Can I bring it over to your pool?  Yeah, take it in the pool.  Have a demonstration.  That would be really funny.  Have a demonstration in Ann's pool.  I'd be kind of...  Dude, here you are in the pool.  Look, I'll show you everything it does.  Yeah.  I can't.  You could show all the bells and whistles.  And then we could be on the water.  It's got a lot of bells and whistles.  And put little plastic fish on your hook.  Give it a little tug.  No, you can actually...  We can play war.  And I'm the Germans.  Sorry, wait a second.  I want to be the Germans.  I don't want to offend you.  Yes, you can be the Germans. 
[02:03:30]  And I'm still on the beaches of Normandy.  Yes.  And I pull up on my boat.  You have to shoot.  No, I backed out on it.  You did.  You did.  I saw that.  We're trying today, Bobby.  I was trying to be nice.  We're going to do something a little different.  We're trying.  I'm trying.  Hey, I like when you talk about the bells and whistles.  So what are the bells and whistles on this rowboat?  First of all, it's got a swivel seat.  So I'm going to explain.  Okay.  When you're on one of the regular boats...  I've done the swivel seat.  I've got to be with Bobby. 
[02:04:00]  If there's a fish over there, you have to turn the whole boat over there.  The whole boat.  Right?  But now you just do the swivel seat.  You just kind of move your hips and it turns your direction.  It turns it.  And you can put a...  It's got a motor mount in the back.  That motor is shitty.  You swivel your seat.  That's an electric motor, you jackass.  It's a little electric motor.  Look how old it is.  Yeah, but you can't use a regular motor.  Put a fucking giant mercury.  100 horsepower.  And how fast do you go?  And if you swivel your seat, your feet go in the fucking water. 
[02:04:30]  7,000.  Now your feet don't go in the water.  They do.  I mean, there's no room.  Look at you.  Swivel around.  Man, you fucking...  You're going to drag your toes over the motor and lose fucking...  To a swivel.  When you sit down in a seat, your knees aren't supposed to hit your chin, Bobby.  It's horrible.  Now look at the...  Look at that.  It's horrendous looking.  It's not...  It's not more comfy.  But here's the thing.  If you're a little longer like yourself, if you have a longer gait than me...  Thank you, Bobby.  You can get a seat riser.  A seat riser.  That brings the seat up a little higher.  Oh, great.  Yeah, and get that center of gravity just precariously perched. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Say that five times.  P-boy.  Center of gravity precariously perched.  P-boy makes a good point.  The reason the seat's so low is because if you're too high, that fog is going to tip  over.  Look at that guy cruising.  What's he doing?  He's cranking with the horse.  No, I think he's exhausted from having to paddle his rope on.  Now, this is the best part.  Look at that.  The C-Eagle fits in a bag right in your truck.  Yeah, it never fits that meat.  At Dusto, absolutely does.  You'll never put it back in that bag like that.  I think it stinks me open it.  I've done it five times.  Dude, 42 pounds.  He's lugging 50 pounds through the woods.  42 pounds, because then you have your other shit. 
[02:05:30]  What about the motor?  No, I'm just saying this is 42 pounds.  I don't use a motor.  Just the boat.  Plus your fishing gear, plus your backpack.  Look at this.  Wait, wait.  Isn't that how dirty that is when you put it back in the bag?  Yeah, it stinks.  No, that's a fucking lake water.  Look at that.  And fish guts.  And the smell of fish.  Hey, can we play?  I like the idea that the orders are fastened.  Let's go backwards, because we've got to hear the audio of this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the audio.  All the way back.  Let's hear the big pitch.  This is what Bobby bought.  One of my favorite songs.  To fill some emptiness in his soul. 
[02:06:00]  Put it to your launching spot.  Simply unroll it and inflate it.  Blow up doll.  It comes loaded with a full fabric floor, an inflatable seat, four convenient carry handles,  and a few built-in rod holders.  And a spike shoes.  Two rod holders.  The setup is easy, too, because it has no frame.  Look at that.  No frame.  There's nothing to assemble.  He's talking about you.  In just four minutes, you are ready to go after the big ones.  He's talking about you'll be boneless.  Several option packages let you add a wooden floorboard, a swivel seat, motor mount, and motor. 
[02:06:30]  Our ultimate pack, as shown here, features the Torquedo electric outboard board.  It's one bad hat, Harry.  It's one of its best electric outboard.  Handy, optional stove pouches can clip on easily to hold your gear.  I got that.  Slide it easily into the water.  I'll never get in a seagull again.  Or use our new easy cart to wheel it like a hand cart right to the water's edge.  It really is that easy.  On the water, the frameless pontoon boat is extremely stable. 
[02:07:00]  So stable, you can stand to cast.  That's because the twin pontoons create a very wide beam.  So a seagull in the water had bumped into it.  It toppled over.  The pontoon has made you more dangerous.  A conditional hold.  The boat goes in the water.  Bob gets in the boat.  Seagull goes to the bottom of the lake.  Farewell and adieu to you.  Inflatable seagull in the water.  That makes the frameless pontoon boat highly maneuverable. 
[02:07:30]  I hate this boat.  This boat's the best boat ever.  It's a raft.  It's not a raft.  It's a boat.  The shallow draft also.  It's a sea eagle.  A squirrel that slammed two acorns into our side.  We sank in two minutes.  What happens if the thing pops?  It's class A wrappers, you eggplant.  What if a hook?  What about a hook?  A fish hook.  It's class A.  What happens if it does pop?  Class A.  What happens though?  You can't hook a hook into it.  Do you got like a tire kit? 
[02:08:00]  A fish, a fly fishing hook is not.  I'm not.  Oh wait, he's going to take a hammer to it.  Look.  Oh.  Wait, but the other side.  Oh, the claw hammer is better though.  You certainly wouldn't try this with any ordinary boat.  You see, take 51, a bunch of popped ones on the side.  Can you pause this?  He just said you certainly wouldn't try this with any ordinary boat.  Yeah.  Put a hammer to an ordinary boat.  Yes, of course you would.  And the claw wasn't a straight claw.  Right.  It was a curved claw on the hammer, so it's not hitting anything sharp.  And then they had a sound effect to make it sound better. 
[02:08:30]  You're not supposed to do it at all.  Hit it with a hammer?  You're not supposed to hit a boat with a hammer.  I thought he makes a good point.  It's like, look, you're not even supposed to ever do that.  I saw it in a commercial.  But when you're down these rivers, there's a lot of like sticks and stuff.  Rocks and sticks.  Yeah.  Near the fucking banks.  Jagged things.  Jagged things.  You're going to pop this shit.  You don't pop it.  You're not going to pop it.  It's going to pop.  You don't pop.  It's not going to pop.  It's going to pop.  How hard would you laugh if he fucking his boat...  Oh, my God.  If I was on it?  If you were all wet, just dead.  Well, the best part is you don't have to wear your... 
[02:09:00]  On the other boat, your feet go in the water.  Right.  I don't like that.  So is your boat muddy somewhere right now because you haven't used it?  No.  Of course it is.  No, it isn't.  It isn't, Jim.  First of all, you've never done anything outside, ever.  What have you done outside?  I've been fishing.  It stinks.  What are you, some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Where did you go fishing?  Fucking Vermont.  Stop swearing.  Where?  It's boring.  When I was a kid, a bunch of innocent fish minding the business.  I'm not talking about a Zebco with a bobber.  I don't know what that large-mouthed bass will do with it.  It might eat it, I suppose. 
[02:09:30]  See, because it's small.  I love fishing.  I just hate your sea.  Can't stay down with five sea bass and sea fucking things.  I know.  I fucking tripped.  I said sea bass.  I'm thoroughly enjoying the ranching going on about the seagull.  Go with a little seagull.  Go with trout.  Five trout.  This boat is amazing.  If you have a good day of fishing, the thing will sink.  This is for lakes, too, by the way.  When you're fishing, fly fishing on a lake or a pond.  You're not going in the lake with this fucking robot. 
[02:10:00]  I've been in it seven times.  You said five a minute ago.  Five times I've been using it.  That means two times.  No, I've used it five times.  And you got the swivel seat?  Swivel seat.  That's pretty good.  Did you fix what Jimmy broke?  I can't stand, Anthony.  I love you so much, dude.  Because you're going to trashing, and then you go, you got the swivel seat?  It's all right.  Well, because I understand.  To have to turn the whole boat with snakes.  Well, we all understand the swivel seat.  And you're out there alone?  We don't have a problem with the swivel seat.  Alone.  On the fucking ocean?  On the fucking lake?  On the lake?  On the lake?  It's better than being in the meatpacking district alone at three in the morning. 
[02:10:30]  Yes, you're right.  But if you have a friend, the meatpacking district is much better.  Who is this in a pond by yourself?  That's just me.  It fucking blows.  It's the same thing as you fishing for hookers.  I'm fishing for trout.  That's true.  I don't have enough.  This is cheaper.  Yeah, but I don't have to pack her up into a bag and carry her home.  You will someday.  Sometimes Jimmy has a hard time pulling his cock out of her mouth.  He's not pulling it out like a hook.  You got to use a pair of needle-nose pliers. 
[02:11:00]  This one's too young.  Throw it back.  She's a sea eagle, but it's just the letter C.  Bobby, I'm just upset that we don't get to do this together anymore.  You've made it loud and clear you want to be out there by yourself.  Bobby.  Oh, man.  I really.  Opie.  It was our thing.  This is what you do.  It was our thing.  This is what you do.  It was our thing.  Let me look at me.  Anthony and Jimmy.  Yeah.  This is what he does.  It drives me fucking batty.  All right.  Then let's fight.  My wife does the same thing you do. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, no.  I'm a chick.  You'll take a little thing and you'll fucking just.  And I'll tell you, it's not it.  And you'll keep going with it.  Yeah.  But you do it.  You do it with a fucking smile on your face, you cucksucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do I?  You fuck.  Is that what I'm doing?  Yeah.  These cucksuckers, at least they're trashing me out in the open.  I'm trashing.  You're getting under my skin.  He's a Navy SEAL trasher.  He's slow.  He's like fucking 007. 
[02:12:00]  You're dead on the floor because you drank his fucking poison.  What I'm saying, like a chick, my feelings have been hurt.  Uh-oh.  You want to go fishing without me?  Aw.  You know what?  You know we have a good time.  First of all, if that's true, that's the most amazing thing that's ever been said on this show.  First of all.  My feelings are a bit hurt.  Oh, man.  You're making it obvious you want to be out there by yourself now.  You only go once a year.  Dude, if you had one of those, you two could you tie them together and shit?  Imagine that.  That's gay.  That'd be great. 
[02:12:30]  And then shoot each other like fucking...  If we docked our docking Dylan?  We're docking our boats on our lake together.  Dock them together.  I think what's happening here, me and Bobby have gone fly fishing twice.  I'm bad luck, right?  You do way better when I'm not around.  No, you are.  You're not bad luck at all.  It's the last time we went, we did that boat stuff.  Jimmy goes fly fishing at the rest stops.  Jimmy puts his dick out of the door of the stall and wiggles it. 
[02:13:00]  Wiggles it like fucking...  What are you using over there?  Yeah, you put your pecker in the water.  Oh, God damn fucking shit.  We might have to go to break.  I don't know.  The, uh...  There's a gay guy driving by the woods at a rest stop.  He's like, what's that?  What is it?  What are you using over there?  What do you got over there?  What are they biting on today? 
[02:13:30]  What are they biting on?  He's matching the hatch.  Oh, Big Daddy.  I don't know.  You know what?  I don't need you.  How could you bash him?  I'm going to call Rich.  I'm calling up Rich.  You're not going to have fun with Rich.  Jimmy just put his shoe on a puffy sandwich.  Hey, you broke one of our lights. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  That was hilarious.  Jimmy took off his shoe.  I didn't want to smash it.  I didn't want to get it all over him.  I couldn't help it.  It was just sitting there begging me to punch it.  So Jimmy put his dirty fucking shoe right up on his breakfast burrito.  He took my shoe off.  He just laid it on top of his burrito.  Is that the shoe you've had for like fucking nine years?  Yeah, these shoes have seen better days.  Bobby had to just throw it out.  What are you going to do?  You can't eat it.  Bobby, you could have ate that.  Oh, Bobby.  I placed it perfectly.  No.  In the city, you know what the fuck you're stepping on? 
[02:14:30]  You brush that off and you eat that shit.  Oh, my God.  No.  I couldn't punch it, though.  I didn't want to get all over him.  Yeah, that would have sucked.  I got a big audition, too.  I can't really knock him.  You know, that's probably...  If you're into fishing, that's probably pretty cool.  It looks a little flimsy.  It does look...  I'd have gone with the next step up.  There's no next step up.  There is.  There's not.  There's got to be.  There's no next step up.  One that's a little wider, maybe.  There's no step up.  Yes, there is.  No, there isn't.  The Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[02:15:00]  He was a lonely zilch in the middle of the lake, and we were all hoping he'd die really  quickly.  Oh, man, Jim, you're a fucking...  Jim's just a...  Jim's just a...  Jim's just a...  Edmund Fitzgerald.  I thought we were going to do that today, Bobby.  It's Jim.  He's a mean...  You can't help him.  Jim is an asshole at heart.  Well, we all know that.  And when he gets on a roll, you can't...  I'm going to make it to 10 without one. 
[02:15:30]  No, you're not.  I'm going to.  Jim is just a mean...  You're just a mean guy, Jim.  You're a mean person.  You've ruined my sandwich, you've ruined my boat, and you've hurt my feelings.  You're not a friend.  That's what I said to somebody yesterday.  Yeah, if you go on ONA, if they don't know you, they'll help you.  If you're friends with them, it's the worst thing you can do for your career.  It really is terrible, yes.  It's the worst thing you can do for your career.  I'm ordering you one right now.  I hope he's the only genuine guy in Anthony.  I think.  Well, that's two out of three. 
[02:16:00]  That's what I meant.  Oh, stupid.  Stop doing math.  That means it's only me.  Yeah, exactly.  But you almost made me feel special.  You are special.  I was happy there for a second.  I wanted to do some mean math.  I like 200 plus 300 equals him.  Get off me.  Get off me.  I'm sick of you, Jim.  I'm sick of Jim.  That's all he does.  Every time I come on, he's just fat, fat, fat.  And then I get to listen to his stupid fucking fans on Twitter. 
[02:16:30]  Fat, fat, fat.  I block.  It's a nightmare.  Just block.  Block away.  I should rather not come on the show.  More people would show up this weekend at Levity Live tonight, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  More people would show up.  That's a very strange block.  You did imply that I should burrow in dirt, though, when I said I wasn't sleeping.  Oh, burrow in dirt?  I would never say that.  That's pretty funny.  I would never say that.  I don't sleep well, and Bob goes, have you tried to fucking burrow in dirt?  And then he goes, why don't you land on a potted plant?  I never said that. 
[02:17:00]  I never.  I would never say that about you.  You should take care of that.  That's really funny.  Yeah, I would.  That's really funny.  To a girl we were talking to.  What girl?  Kristen.  Oh, she's not a girl.  Why don't we break?  Bob Kelly, Levity Live, West Nyack, New York, to the Palisades Mall tonight through Sunday.  Highly recommend to see Bob Kelly.  You should just do your fucking stand-up sitting down in your boat on your swivel seat.  Dude.  With a fishing pole.  The curtain opens, and you're just like, hey, how you doing, people?  Can you have Sea Eagle Night?  And you're just casting.  Sea Eagle Night.  Hey, people. 
[02:17:30]  So, let me tell you a little story.  And you tell these long-winded stories.  There's a lot of people in New Hampshire that story tell.  Ew!  No, I'm serious.  Can we talk about this next?  Yeah, sure.  Storytelling.  No, that's a good tease.  Let's not get distracted.  Because I know we're going to go off on that for a while.  I want to hear this.  And we've got big ends coming in at 9.30.  We've got this coming in at 9.30.  This?  I kind of like it.  Oh, God.  You kind of like this?  Yeah, that's kind of my thing.  Not my type.  Yeah.  Not quite my type.  I wouldn't, I mean, I wouldn't, you know, get married and go to fucking Aruba together, 
[02:18:00]  but I'd fucking...  That's your type.  It's like Steven Tyler with huge tits.  I'd take a cab.  This?  I'd take a cab.  All right.  More with Bob Kelly.  Stay there.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right, man.  Where are we going?  All right.  I'll tell you where we're going.  Go to fun and land.  He's back with an all-new CD.  Where are we going?  What are the termites eat for breakfast? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, what up, Billy?  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Where are we going?  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Fuck the...  Rock me.  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right.  What's Mary short for?  She's got no legs. 
[02:19:00]  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman and his all-new CD.  Where are we going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to that fucking whore that I used to bone with a 38 double D's to ruin my life. 
[02:19:30]  Fuck you and your gigantic, natural, tremendous tits, you fucking psycho whore.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  I'd just like to say fuck you to all you assholes with your stupid little six-figured decals on the back of your SUVs to tell us how many fucking dogs and cats and kids and mothers and fathers you got.  Who gives a shit?  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you out to anyone that doesn't like the word cunt. 
[02:20:00]  You're all fucking cunt faces.  Fuck you, cunt faces.  Fuck you!  This is a big fuck you.  Goes out to Nikki Sixx of Mommy Crew, you fat, rooster-haired, trawlerous cunt.  Stop talking about you being an artist.  You're an ex-drug addict who doesn't know any other string on your friggin' instrument except the G-string.  Learn how to fucking play your instrument before you call yourself an artist squad.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Is it just me or does Nina Blackwood sound like Christy the Clown? 
[02:20:30]  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  To my ex-wife, fuck you.  If you happen to pass the waves before me, I will go to your grave and pee for shit on it.  Fuck you?  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to everyone who says they can't stop singing Mimi Beardsley.  Shut up!  Go fuck yourself.  We get it.  It's a song.  It's catchy.  It's fucking awesome.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to the woman in line in front of me at Walmart last night. 
[02:21:00]  You didn't fit your pants and you smelled like you shit yourself.  Had to smell that until you left and it still lingered.  F.U.  Fuck you!  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:30]  Bob Kelly in studio.  Shut up, Bobby.  I got this part.  Levity Live, West Nyack, New York, in the Palisades Mall tonight through Sunday.  Levity Live.com for Bob Kelly.  Welcome back.  And I got Dan Soda with me, too.  I like Dan Soda.  From my show.  And Kelly Fistuka, the other girl on my show, is going to be there.  Fucking Dan Soda.  Soda.  Soda, as we say in Long Island, for Soda.  Soda.  Yeah.  Did our show?  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  And he passed the audition.  He will be back.  He's really good.  He's a very funny kid.  Very funny guy.  Jimmy left to get his picture with Tony Danza. 
[02:22:00]  Tony Danza?  I'm going to be running for mayor of New York City.  Look at my hog in my Spider-Man outfit.  That was hilarious.  That was one of our favorite moments.  Oh, God.  When he had his goddamn talk show.  It was fantastic.  He came back with his apron on.  Yeah.  Covering his fucking big.  My big hog.  My big Tony Danza dick.  Which is a fat helmet. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  His big dick was just fucking hanging down.  It was terrible.  Fucking wild mushroom.  Halloween extravaganza.  I hope he does, like, run for mayor just so we get some clips of him.  I think he is.  He's running for mayor?  Yeah.  He wants to run for mayor in New York City.  I don't think he'll come in, though.  He probably won't, but...  We got Bob Tully.  Tony Danza?  We got the big Ange.  Fucking throw me out like that sandwich.  No, you stay here.  Tony Danza comes in.  What are you, nuts?  We got the big Ange coming in. 
[02:23:00]  Big Ange.  She can wait.  I don't know who she is, actually.  I wouldn't fucking...  I don't know why we said yes to the big Ange.  I don't know shit about her.  I don't either.  She's on a show.  We were talking about her, and we were watching a video of her.  The next thing you know, she's booked on the show.  I think...  I'm confused.  Well, now I remember Roland came in, and I think everybody was saying, can you get this  woman for our show?  Oh, okay.  You might have to start recording our conversations, because I think he gets frustrated, too.  All of our guest pitches to Roland are like drunk blackouts.  We're like, I don't remember doing that.  Oh, yeah, you did it. 
[02:23:30]  And sometimes it's easier to just say yes, because you want to get out of the building faster.  Well, that's true.  Hey, Bobby, I know what it was.  Bobby.  New Hampshire.  Story time, guy.  Story time.  What is this storytelling?  You said everyone has a story or likes telling stories in New Hampshire.  Well, they have storytellers.  There's these guys.  What is that?  I met like three of them when I was up there.  Wow.  Boring.  At a coffee shop?  Weird.  I met one guy.  We were trying to get a piece of wood at this.  This guy has wood.  Yeah, there we were. 
[02:24:00]  Must tell you, we were out on the water.  It had to be near probably eight hours.  I'm calling you out on that one.  That's Maine.  Well, yeah.  It's up there in the same area.  It was a Maine guy that drove down.  There's no difference.  No, I've been to New Hampshire.  They speak a little differently.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They might have nothing to say, but they sound differently as they're saying nothing.  Can't get there from here.  Petra Farm remembers.  Petra Farm remembers.  What kind of wood store do you tell?  I wanted to buy some wood, so I went outside.  There it was.  Why did you need wood? 
[02:24:30]  We were looking for a mantle for a fireplace.  He died a few years ago.  Oh, jeez.  Dude, I don't know.  What do women do?  They go on.  My mission is getting a Seagull or a new iPhone.  Hers is buying wood.  A piece of wood for a mantle?  Yeah, for a fireplace.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  It was a piece of wood that's going to be made into the mantle?  Made into a mantle.  It's a big piece of fucking wood.  Well, I don't have...  No, it's not a big fireplace.  Why'd you get it custom made?  It's a New York City fireplace.  Get it custom made.  It's not your mansion fireplace.  You want to buy one in the store?  It's a fucking 1820 building. 
[02:25:00]  It's when they made a fireplace in a living room just to heat up a fucking family of 18.  Get it custom made.  Huh?  Why are you doing all the hard work?  No, it's...  Hire a guy and go, hey.  That's what we were.  That's the guy.  Oh.  We're at a wood guy place.  You're getting a piece of wood and then you're going to like...  No, this guy custom...  Then you're going to whittle it into something.  He has all this wood and he makes furniture and we went in and the guy was talking to me  and he was like, what do you do?  I go, I do comedy, which you expect to explain.  First mistake.  And then he goes, yeah, I do too, kind of. 
[02:25:30]  I'm a storyteller.  I do funny stories.  Oh, God.  It's just like, wow.  Storytellers.  Had a nice piece of wood and there was a knot in it where it was very inconvenient.  After all these years, you haven't learned that you tell these people the most boring  job ever so they don't ask to follow a question.  I tell that to Asian massage parlor ladies because you can't...  Comment?  What?  Comment?  How do you mean comment?  Comedy?  You know, jokes.  Comedy?  Comedy?  Comedy?  I don't know.  Well, Asians have a very good sense of humor I've found over the years.  Yeah, they do.  Excuse me when you roll over. 
[02:26:00]  It's volcano.  Look at me.  It's you.  Oh, my God.  It erupts.  They must be laughing.  Oh, baby.  Pulling that practical joke they all love to pull out on the roads.  Where it's like, oh, okay.  I'm doing two miles an hour.  Get it?  Because they drive slow.  Boy, was I tied up there.  I didn't know where to go.  And we both just stared at you.  I know.  That's all you have on storytellers?  Dude, type in storytellers.  Do video search.  Don't do web search.  We're going to read it.  What the fuck are you doing?  What the fuck are you doing? 
[02:26:30]  Sam, video searching.  He wants us to read about storytelling.  And now he sees we got MTV Storytellers or VH1 Storytellers.  Not them.  Storytellers.  Storytellers.  Yeah, New Hampshire.  From New Hampshire.  New Hampshire Storytellers.  We teased this segment on the show.  It better be good.  Yeah, really.  It's terrible.  Before the break, I said we're going to talk about storytelling.  Oh, boy.  It's terrible.  Don't let the people down, Bobby.  It's not me.  God damn it, Bobby.  It was your tease.  God damn it, Bobby.  Well, if you had a fucking guy that could find some YouTube storytelling.  Come on, Sam.  Stop playing games.  Jesus, Sam. 
[02:27:00]  Stop looking for wrestling clips.  There we go.  Bob Tales.  Bob Tales Storytelling.  There we go, guys.  Come on.  It's by Bob Reiser.  120 views.  That's not bad.  120 views.  You're not paying that over a year.  Up there.  That's a lot.  Heroes come in every size.  Who is it?  Who is it?  And I found this wonderful Japanese story.  I hate you, Bobby.  About a one-inch boy.  About a bomb that went off. 
[02:27:30]  A one-inch boy.  Sure.  That's the cutest thing I ever saw.  He's acting it out like there's a one-inch boy.  He's doing both.  It's got all these demons in it.  There's demons in it.  Isn't Boshi.  The one-inch boy.  This guy has got to be a pedophile.  Oh, I know this guy.  I'm your Uncle Paul.  Sure.  The one-inch boy story.  I think these characters started coming out of it as I was doing it. 
[02:28:00]  Wait.  Characters got out of it.  Suddenly, out from behind the bush, lived a terrible demon.  He was really horrible.  I had a great big job.  Is he in front of an audience of children?  Nine-year-olds.  A firing squad.  I think I just heard him got heckled by a nine-year-old.  Yes.  You suck.  Yeah.  You got to keep the stories interesting.  Oh, really?  There's a little one-inch boy.  Yeah.  Come here.  Let me give you something to hold while I tell you this story. 
[02:28:30]  By the end of the story, he turns into a two-inch boy.  Yeah.  Why don't you kiss the bag the boy's holding?  So they have...  Smells like onions.  Smells like onions.  Smells like he's carrying a bag of fish.  Yes, Bobby.  So they have these bars and these local pubs and these little restaurants, and the guy  will come in and they'll do storytelling night.  Like comedy.  We have a little better audio, Sam.  Yeah, this audio is echoey.  You know who's a storyteller?  And he's very good at it.  Sleeves. 
[02:29:00]  Whose sleeves?  I hate sleeves.  You know what?  We probably should play the leaf one again.  No, this is the Christmas thing.  No, this is the Christmas shit.  We're not ready for the Christmas sleeves yet.  Don't fucking subject me to this now.  We're ready for the fall foliage.  Oh, here's Judy.  Judy.  Oh, look at this fucking lump of shit.  Come on.  He's just showing you something.  That's not me, Jim.  Oh.  He is me.  I'm sorry.  You're a fucking nerd.  You know what, Jim?  Sometimes you cut deep.  Oh, shit.  That was very mean, Bobby. 
[02:29:30]  I want to acknowledge I'm mean.  Jimmy's mean to you.  Yeah, but his timing is really brilliant.  Jimmy's timing.  That's why people get confused.  This woman is shaped like a mountain, and she's got a head of a...  Her hair looks like a cumulonimbus cloud.  It's a cancer wig.  She's wearing a cancer wig.  What kind of cloud is it?  A cumulonimbus storm cloud.  Look, it's all dark.  Like the ones that get done in Tampa?  Yes, they're all rolling in dark clouds.  That's what her hair looks like.  A mini cloud over her head. 
[02:30:00]  That's funny.  She looks like a big man.  I hope her story...  I hope it's a bad story.  Let's just fast forward to the middle.  And then they said...  No, she's fucking...  Sonny Wart's his wife.  And he says to me, get on the ride, you fat pig.  And I said, is he going to shoot me and dump my pie in the river?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What kind of memory are you?  Let's hear Judy Pelkin?  Pelican.  No, Pelkin.  Jokey Pelkin.  Let's hear her story.  Judy Pelkin. 
[02:30:30]  Kill herself for all I care.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Featuring Judy...  Piken.  Oh, Piken.  Oh, of course.  Piken.  Piken.  Yeah.  The Piken.  The Beggar King.  Oh.  That was really quick.  Charles Taylor.  Can I have a piece of gum so I can kill the hunger pains I have?  I'm sorry.  They're getting a new one.  Oh, fucking asshole.  They're ordering you new one.  I don't want a new one.  Hold the shoe.  I don't want one.  Bring it on.  Hold the shoe.  Terrible.  That was so mean, Jerry. 
[02:31:00]  Hold the nine and a half wide.  Yes, hold it and just gently...  Gently manipulated.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead.  The Beggar.  The Beggar King is the story that Judy Piken's going to be...  Hold on.  The lesbian hairdo just walked by.  I saw.  Who's that?  The emo kid.  Steve Blatter.  Steve Blatter.  Emo kid.  All right.  Let's see.  The Beggar King.  By Judy Piken.  Truth and illusion.  What we see.  What we think we see. 
[02:31:30]  A pig.  Oh, no.  The king of the demons stood in chains before King Solomon's throne.  Sounds like a cartoon.  Now that the temple is built, said Solomon, I will give you your freedom.  4,400 views?  How bad.  Provided that you can give me the answer to a question that has plagued me deeply.  Yes.  Monistat 7.  I am asked to be a wife. 
[02:32:00]  625.  Diabetes.  No, it doesn't look natural.  Go back to the question part.  We'll stop it.  Provided that you can give me the answer to a question.  That has plagued me deeply. 
[02:32:30]  Monistat 7?  It's just too funny, dude.  The burning itch.  I don't even remember Monistat 7.  What a fucking great...  This chick.  Can we bail on this chick?  No, I want to hear her story.  This is good.  I like her story.  This is good.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear a little more.  We'll hear a little more.  She is really overdramatic.  Are all the storytellers dramatic like this, Bobby?  Yeah, Bobby.  They're all dramatic.  Yes, to tell a story, you have to...  When you walk into a room and you see a woodpecker through the window, and he looks at you for 
[02:33:00]  a glance, and then begins to peck again.  Oh, I like this story.  And then...  Bobby's a storyteller.  I sit in the rocking chair and I grab the needle and thread, and I begin to make my mittens,  knowing that the winter will come soon.  I can feel the door open, and the wind curls my toes.  There is a loud crashing sound as the rock... 
[02:33:30]  So, me and Jimmy are storytellers together?  Bobby, I, for one...  He just insults you as you're telling your story.  But I, for one, was enjoying the storytelling, Bobby.  Sorry, go ahead.  I was enjoying it.  So, I have.  Can you add, like, candlelight or something?  Something like you're knitting mittens.  I'm knitting mittens.  Maybe a cold...  To put on the German Shepherd. 
[02:34:00]  Maybe some cold, cold climate outside.  All right, it's cold outside.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Okay.  As I pick myself up off the floor...  Yeah, you gotta start there.  I grab the wood that is now used to be my rocking chair, and I make it into kindling,  knowing that soon the whistle will blow and my hot cocoa will be ready to drink.  Oh.  Ooh.  Crackling fire.  I hear a knock at the door.  Is it the woodpecker?  Is it a friend?  Is it a foe?  Count that out. 
[02:34:30]  The intervention group?  Woodpecker's a right to fall.  It's the pizza guy.  That's good.  Creepy Craig.  The pizza guy.  Oh, shit.  My voice.  I gotta stop.  Oh, is that a funny one?  No, keep storytelling.  We like this.  You found your niche. 
[02:35:00]  Yes.  As I walk...  Knock at the door.  Knock at the door.  As I walk across the floor, you can hear the creaks.  I see the water in the glass move.  I want to hear the story.  I apologize.  How does the story go?  You're walking across the floor.  Oh, shit.  I got the visual.  Walk across the floor. 
[02:35:30]  You're going to open the door?  I don't know.  I go to the door, and I do not look out the peek hole, because I know in my heart, in  my heart's heart, in the hearts of hearts of hearts, that it is a friend.  I open the door quickly, and the rush of cold air hits my bald head.  Oh, well, okay.  And I look to the left and to the right, and nobody is there.  Nobody is there.  Friend, foe, woodpecker. 
[02:36:00]  Where'd the woodpecker go?  I thought you already said it was a friend.  He knew it in his heart of hearts, but then he's opening it, and he was wrong.  Oh, I see where you're going, all right.  The cold air hit his bald head.  I shut the door.  I go back.  I hear...  The faint whistle of my hot cocoa being ready.  I run back into the kitchen.  Oh, what's left of it.  Someone has tricked me. 
[02:36:30]  They knocked on my front door to get my misdirection, so that they could go into the kitchen and take  all of my food and crumpets.  Crumpets?  The sounds of the tractor trailer backing up should have tipped me off.  I see the red lights of a truck leaving.  It was not a woodpecker at all. 
[02:37:00]  It was a Mack truck backing up into my house.  The only thing they left me was a whistling kettle that was whistling in my face.  I turned the gas down.  The whistle slowly...  Subsided?  Yes.  Slowly subsided.  You can play along with this story.  The whistle slowly subsided.  The whistle... 
[02:37:30]  Hold on.  Now, because the hole in the wall from the truck, the cold air rushes through my bones, into  my eyes, and out my ears.  Because there's nothing inside to stop it.  I pour myself a cup of hot cocoa as quickly as possible. 
[02:38:00]  I put my slippers on, my robe that my grandmother once made me, and my mittens...  Out of a ship sail.  I put the mittens that are barely made on my hands. 
[02:38:30]  I run to the fire, and I stoke it with the rocking chair that is now broken because of  my weight.  Oh, shit!  The fire warms my bones, warms my heart, warms my eyes, and I realize that I'm alone in  my house.  With a gaping hole in the side, yes.  With a hole in the side, sitting by a fire, with an almost understable urge to put an 
[02:39:00]  apple in my own mouth.  And I realize I have no apples, or crumpets, or tea.  You've been robbed.  Is that how the story ends?  I have no chair.  I have no food.  I have no friends.  I have no foe.  But what do you have?  I have a woodpecker in the distance.  Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck. 
[02:39:30]  Gently tap.  Tired of Anne Frankfurter.  People just want to put food in everything.  I wonder why.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Earnest Heavyweight's coming in, too.  Earnest Heavyweight.  That's a good one.  I officially didn't make a fat joke.  I like it.  Daddy liked my story.  I like it.  I can see that on book radio.  I'm a good storyteller, and I'm a professional whistler.  Right, Sam?  That's right.  Do you know how to whistle? 
[02:40:00]  Like Steve the Whistler?  I actually was a professional whistler from 1997 to 1999.  I was a world champion.  Two years?  Can you give us a little bit?  Give us a little.  I can try.  When are you going to whistle?  Well, I'll whistle.  Do you whistle patriotic stuff?  This is what I won in 1999 with, okay?  All right.  This is terrible. 
[02:40:30]  I'm faking it good.  No, he won the competition doing this.  We're blessed to have him today.  Oh, I know this song. 
[02:41:00]  It's like a drum solo.  What is he doing?  Wow.  Oh.  All right.  You know what?  You won the competition in 1999.  Yeah, because I...  What title?  What title?  The grand master champion?  I was the champion whistler of 1999 of the world.  Damn. 
[02:41:30]  The world.  I beat a Korean.  Damn.  Jean-Kwon Kwon.  Very hard for them to whistle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking bullshit.  Oh, Chippa.  What's the matter, Chip?  Number one.  This...  I actually wrote a couple of my songs.  My grandfather.  This guy's a punk right here.  Hey, Steve the Whistler at this thing?  I...  Now, this is the guy I beat.  I don't know.  He sounds pretty good. 
[02:42:00]  What?  What are they putting typewriting sounds in it?  I don't know.  Stupid.  This guy's...  He's a friend of mine.  He's a friend of mine.  I gave him that part right there I helped him with. 
[02:42:30]  It's terrible.  I can't whistle.  Oh, poor Jimmy can't whistle.  That's right.  This bitch there.  She cheats.  Yeah, that's from a cartoon I did for Disney years ago.  That was when the birds came out.  Oh, look at this idiot.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Where's Steve the Whistler?  Jeffrey Ross.  Jeffrey Ross.  Sick. 
[02:43:00]  This guy with binoculars.  Ah, I could have danced all night.  Oh, you know the song?  She's got good lungs for whistlers.  She's got giant tits.  Everybody can whistle, but it makes it...  It's fascinating that it's coming out of your human body without using an instrument.  Yeah, but you have a million instruments to make it sound good.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the three whistling tenors.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  These guys are hacks.  God.  They're hacks.  Oh, they're all whistling now on stage.  It's like a whistling fucking jam session.  Yeah.  I wasn't there that year.  Bobby, can you give us just a little more to break?  Yeah.  Because we've got Big Ang coming up with her new book, Bigger is Better.  Whistling is terrible.  Yeah.  This is a song my grandfather wrote.  It's a number called Put This in Your Mouth, Son.  Oh, my God. 
[02:44:00]  Bobby's going to be at Levity Live at West Nyack, New York, in the Palisades Mall tonight through Sunday.  And Jimmy's leaving us in a little while to go out there to California.  Irvine.  California.  Improv.  All weekend long, right, Jimmy?  Friday, Saturday?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Tonight, you were performing out there.  This is what the seagull sounds like when it's deflating.  That's funny. 
[02:44:30]  Big Ang next.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  The kids are running wild because school's out, but cool's in.  No reason to get antsy.  Yeah, where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh, my God.  California is trendsetting again with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody. 
[02:45:00]  Hey, Jim.  Did you, like, hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad?  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh, my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley, and in the valley, we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops, turn it up.  Middle finger time. 
[02:45:30]  Like, that's my grandmother.  Oh, my God.  You're so old, you should call dirt by name or something.  And a special appearance by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes, hello, well, whatever.  You're, uh, grody, yes.  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Gym, coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk?  Like, with my butt or something?  On the next American War Stories, Battleground, Iraq, Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant 
[02:46:00]  realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve, so we, like, brought, like, little, like, bars and  stuff, like, but there's going to be no food.  There was more, I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was, you go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice  cream.  You could walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you 
[02:46:30]  want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one, and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories. 
[02:47:00]  In a world where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land.  Fuck you and your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  I'm a much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is...  We're going to fight.  Livewire.  I'm not afraid of your information.  Engineer or no engineer.  Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality, and you're an asshole.  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now. 
[02:47:30]  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with Livewire.  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago.  That's exactly my point, you stupid fuck.  Little dick motherfucker.  Couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this.  Strapped in, folks.  This is where it gets really exciting.  Because I'm the truth-sayer.  Livewire.  Coming soon to a theater near you. 
[02:48:00]  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly is discussing something with Jimmy Morton right now. 
[02:48:30]  Hey, Sam.  Hold on, Bob.  What are you talking to Sam about?  Aw, you're getting Bobby all jealous.  You're not into Sam anymore, right?  Because he's a man now.  Remember when he was a little boy?  Yeah, he's probably ordering some green eggs and ham or something.  His hair even looks like a Dr. Seuss character.  Dr. Seuss.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh.  Shut the fuck up.  Bobby, I actually like Sam's new hair.  I like his hair down.  Bobby, I got a treat for you. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, what's up?  We're waiting for the Big Ange to show up.  Yeah.  Bigger is better.  Her new book, Real Life Wisdom from the No Drama Mama.  Bob Kelly's going to be at Levity Live, West Nyack, New York, in the Palisades Mall.  But I want to show you something.  I want to see it, too.  Could you close your eyes until we're ready for you, Bobby?  Yeah, sure.  What is that?  What's that, Bobby?  Sam's funny.  Do you remember which one?  I don't know what that is.  Is that your pass to get up here?  I don't know.  Bobby, let me see.  If you will, please.  Just look at that. 
[02:49:30]  That's a little maggot.  Yeah, a little maggot.  It's got a nose.  Where is it?  Oh!  Bobby.  Bobby.  It's an Indian guy.  Don't fuck yourself, Opie.  I'm not doing it.  Look at that.  What's wrong with you?  Fuck that.  My throat.  You're going to fuck my throat up, you fucking cocksucker.  I don't know what that is.  You're going to fuck up your throat?  I'm not looking at it.  I don't give a fuck.  I got six shows this weekend.  I'm not sabotaging that to look at that stupid shit.  All right, we went to the Levity website.  Look, it's... 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, I don't get it.  What do you think?  This is 87?  Do you want to see the one where there's bugs and the gums?  You're on WAF again?  All right, we went...  Can you look at least...  One second.  No, I won't.  Look, it is really gone.  I don't give a shit.  It's not that bad now.  It's a nose.  I don't care.  I can't.  Listen to me.  I really can't.  I can't, because it might grow.  I'll tell you what it is.  I don't understand it.  Look, see, it's fine.  Look.  You're out of your mind.  Look.  No, I'm not puking.  Look, I'm...  I don't care, Opie.  That's just a nostril.  There's nothing in there.  Ah, fucking A.  There's a whole...  God damn it.  I can't look at this. 
[02:50:30]  There's a whole nest of maggots in this guy's nose.  Yeah, but is it there because...  I love the mic flag.  Why is that there?  Is he dead?  Wait, he's looking at his throat, too.  He's looking at his throat.  Yeah, good.  I'm looking at a mic flag right in front of my face.  See, the throat is fine.  I'm looking at Anthony looking at a mic flag.  I'm not looking.  Bobby, you got throat stuff.  No, because if I do that, I'll fucking shred my throat, and then I won't be able to speak  this weekend.  All right, the video's done.  So Opie can fucking...  All right, the video's done.  It's maggots in a person's nose.  Let's play trust.  They're way up in the...  What happened to you?  Let's play trust.  What happened to you?  Let's play trust.  The video's done.  Here you go.  Ready?  Do you trust me? 
[02:51:00]  Not at all.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Let's just fast forward to five minutes from now.  Ask me if you...  Would you eat those, Anthony?  Never.  With boogers on them?  Ask me...  Ask me...  No!  Ten years from now.  We're in a time machine.  Ten years from now.  Do you trust me, Bobby?  Never.  Never, still?  You're old, you're on your deathbed, and you're holding a cross, and you're saying the Our  Father, and now ask me.  Do you trust me, Bobby?  Absolutely not.  No.  Would you eat one of those?  Imagine fishing your finger in there, and you'd have maggots crawling in a booger film.  I'd use one for fly fishing. 
[02:51:30]  It's a booger film.  Did you want an audition for that?  I'd take...  What about the one under the ghost?  There's a whole nest of maggots.  You could see them all crammed up against the back of the silence.  I would take one of those and put it on a hook.  You could catch a nice rainbow.  Oh, there you go.  How does this fuck up your throat, though?  If I puke...  When I puke, when I throw up, the acid comes up and shreds your throat.  Yeah.  I won't be able to talk.  I used to do acid.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  It's done.  It's done.  I can't even look at it.  It's done.  It's done.  Oh, God.  Fucking get that off.  What is that?  Oh, it's just a bot fly. 
[02:52:00]  A bot fly.  Oh, the bot flies are the worst.  Fucking bot fly.  That's the one that has a hole in your head, and it comes out, and you've got to tape it  shut to kill it.  Ah, tape it.  Something like that.  I don't want a bot fly.  Bot flies aren't bad.  Oh, God.  I don't get a fly.  I don't want a bot fly.  I don't think I got a bot fly.  No.  How about I'd divorce my wife if she had a bot fly?  Oh, who wouldn't?  I literally would take the ring off her finger while she was sleeping.  She'd wake up like in meatballs, the counselor, out in the lake on a bed. 
[02:52:30]  Or in her bot fly.  Oh, I've had it with the bot fly.  No, Bobby, you good?  Parasites.  I'm not good.  I'm trying to show you something.  I know.  It's from your guy, Dr. Steve.  He's on your podcast network.  I love Dr. Steve.  I thought we could share a little bit.  You know, I have to get eye surgery.  What?  I have a pucker on the back of my eye.  What's a pucker on the back of your eye?  It's an asshole.  I woke up one day.  I couldn't read the cable box time.  It was my right eye.  You don't need a new eye.  You need an education.  It's because you couldn't speak.  I get it. 
[02:53:00]  I get it.  I got it.  I don't like that.  Time jokes are stretching it, though.  What's going on with you?  You got a pucker on the back of your eye.  Could you fucking get that off?  I really can't do the show.  What, the hole in the toe?  That's kind of cool.  All of it.  I can't do it.  What's that top one, Sam?  I can't do it.  I forget.  Top right.  It's a pucker succubus.  What's the bun under that?  I don't know what the fuck it is.  Oh, this is easy, Bob.  You can do this one.  Opie, look at me.  Look at me.  Yeah?  Look at me.  Yeah?  It's not going to happen.  You really, you really.  But it's a transsexual. 
[02:53:30]  You like transsexuals.  Well, now you get my curiosity peaked.  I swear it's a transsexual.  It doesn't matter.  No.  No, no.  What was the one other saying?  It's disgusting.  Bobby?  You're so decent.  It's sad that you're decent at times.  Look at the pussy.  That's a nice pussy.  Wait.  All right.  Let's make a deal.  I won't look at it.  I won't look at it.  I won't look at it.  No.  I am not doing it because I can't fucking.  Vaginal exam.  I don't.  Look at me.  Look at my eyes, stupid.  Stupid.  Asshole exam.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What are they doing?  Bobby. 
[02:54:00]  Look at my eyes.  You like it.  Look at my eyes.  Get those fucking pale German eyes.  Look at me.  It's just an asshole.  See, Jimmy.  You European face.  Look at me.  Trust Jimmy.  I don't believe me.  Trust anybody in this room.  Holy fuck.  That is so goddamn.  I'm looking at Andy's face.  You're fucking fucking this whole thing.  Oh, because you so had him.  He was ready to look.  I was going to fuck.  Oh, boy.  What is that?  The asshole looks like a tongue.  It's moving on its own.  Oh, wow.  What is that?  Come on, Bobby.  This is not something you see every day. 
[02:54:30]  I'm not ruining my throat for you.  Don't look at Anthony anymore.  He's giving it away.  It's a nice pussy, though.  Jimmy, it's good, right?  I could give a fuck.  He's sewing something in the asshole.  It's like a fissure being fixed.  It's not that bad.  I thought it was a bug.  Not that bad, really.  Honestly, it's not.  Look to your right.  Nah, you're out of your mind.  I think you could do this one.  You're out of your mind.  I'm encouraging you.  I think you could do this.  You're out of your mind.  Look, I think you could do this.  Nah, you're crazy.  Don't try to pep talk me, Dad.  You know, I'm trying to play on my I-don't-have-a-father routine.  What kind of surgery is it?  I just want to be taught things. 
[02:55:00]  I want pep talks.  Curiosity isn't getting you on this one?  Nah, I'm not doing it.  If my throat was fine, I'd play along with your hijinks.  Yeah, hijinks.  But other than that, you can go fuck yourself.  It looks like a tongue.  I want pep talk to you on your fucking white lady cheeks.  Nah, it's bleeding a little.  Just want to warn you, it's bleeding a little.  Are you okay with blood before you look?  I don't like your cheeks, Ope.  I want you to fix your white lady cheeks.  I got cheekbones.  I know.  I don't like your high fucking cheekbones.  I might be from way up north, I think.  Yeah, you have Viking blood in you. 
[02:55:30]  Or some kind of Eskimo or something.  But you're not a hunter.  I've got something going on there.  You're not the guy that went away on war.  You're the guy that stayed back and planned the war.  Thanks.  Oh, I can plan a war.  Yeah, it's not bad.  That's not bad.  I thought I had to do the cooking with the ladies or something.  No, you're not a cook.  You were gathering nuts and berries.  All right, thanks.  Yeah, you didn't go fight the war?  My biggest problem is I don't know my mom's side of the family at all.  Right.  Do that thing on the internet.  You know, we were hanging out as a family yesterday.  We were trying to figure out what my mom's mom's name is, and we don't know. 
[02:56:00]  How fucked up is that?  That's bad.  That's weird.  Because I'm having a daughter, and I don't want to...  That's great.  I don't want to name her after this fucking cunt.  Are you...  Wow.  Wow.  Which one?  You don't even want to take a chance?  You might hit it.  No.  I just don't name your daughter Gertie or Ethel.  My mom's mom...  Gertie.  My mom's mom, I don't call her a grandma.  She never was.  She's the precious brood.  Yeah.  She has a first name.  None of us know what it is. 
[02:56:30]  How weird is that?  That's weird.  How did that...  And I don't want my daughter to be by accident named after her.  And who is that?  That's your grandmother?  No.  She's my mom's mom.  Your mom's mom.  You could do the math and figure out it's a grandma.  Biologically, yeah.  So, you're having a daughter.  Yeah.  Aren't you excited about having a little girl?  No.  Why?  Yeah, I actually...  Oh.  Sorry.  No.  That was the worst day of fucking Opie's life.  I'm excited, but... 
[02:57:00]  I'm going to a pool party.  Where?  Oh, Jesus.  Uncle, aunt.  Believe me, there's always going to be assholes like me around.  They might play this tape bag.  Of course I'm excited, but I think...  I'm going to stay over.  Anthony's too drunk to drive me home, Dad.  At least I'll be way too old to give a fuck at that point.  Uncle Jimmy's here, too.  We're all in the hot tub.  Oh, my God.  We're going to watch a movie.  Oh, no.  We're playing fucking...  It's called Casino.  He said there's a good part with Pesci in a trailer. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm excited, but...  Fuck.  Fuck.  We know...  If she came home doing movie lines from Godfather, you'd punch her in her face.  As guys, we know all the moves.  I'm just thinking.  Oh, God.  I want to have a daughter more than a boy if I have a kid.  Really?  Yeah, I'm afraid my anger and rage will come out on the guy.  You know what I mean?  I know that I'm better with women.  What?  I'm better with women.  Guys want guys for their first child.  I don't. 
[02:58:00]  I don't want a guy.  There's not a guy alive that doesn't want a son first.  I don't.  First, yeah.  May your first child be a feminine child.  Yeah, you kind of want that kid that's going to guard the...  Also going to guard the daughter.  The Kelly Estate.  The gang.  I want a girl.  You do.  I want a girl.  I don't want a guy.  You want a daughter.  Yeah, I don't want to get into that shit with my...  Oh, you don't know.  Sapphire.  I don't fucking know.  This woman merits you turning off all the fucking TV.  Is she here?  Is she coming in?  Is she here now?  I'll pop right over. 
[02:58:30]  Bobby, this is...  Call it Big Ang.  What's up?  She's in the bathroom taking a duty.  You still got the original case for the iPad.  This is the iPad 1.  I got to go.  You have the iPad 1?  Yeah.  Who's going?  I got to go.  Where are you going?  Irvine, California.  Hey, I got a flight to catch.  I got a show tonight.  Got a show on Friday.  How are you getting there?  Going to take a plane, zip, zip.  You're going to tunnel?  We're going to take...  No, I'm going to take a plane.  Burrow.  Bobby. 
[02:59:00]  Like a mall.  He just pops his head out in a mall parking lot.  It's the wrong place.  I'm in Texas.  I got to go.  Back down.  Can I defend my iPad at least?  Yeah, go ahead.  The screen...  I mean, the screen doesn't look bad.  There's nothing different about...  There's no retina display, my friend.  There's nothing different about this.  Oh.  That was a good move, though.  That was a good move.  You got to give him that.  Dude, you got to give him that.  He stepped up his fucking game.  You got to give him that.  He had some disgusting shit playing on his iPad.  He should have shut the volume off.  Because I heard the volume, and it triggered me off until the last second.  You did look. 
[02:59:30]  That wasn't bad.  That was really good.  To look at another gross video.  Yeah, that was fucking gross.  Well, it's just kind of like a whitehead coming out of an old man's nose.  This is what we do to make me want to puke.  I threw up on him once.  My kid threw up yesterday.  We've shown him disgusting.  I say, fucking bring it.  My puke and your kid's puke is totally different.  Where you want to puke.  Seriously.  Bob's puke tastes like cum.  I was just about to say that, but then I was like, why would I make fun of myself?  Let's negotiate where you puke on me.  I was wondering, if girls swallow cum, does it come out in their piss or shit? 
[03:00:00]  I think it just gets absorbed into that horrid system.  You know what I mean?  It's like, what is that?  Does it come out like an X-Men shit where it's just clear?  Is that a solid or a liquid?  Or does it come out in their piss?  How does cum come out?  Bobby?  Yes, sir.  I'm not going to let you get the best of me.  Where do you want to puke on me?  Let's negotiate this.  On his dick.  Again?  I, uh...  Sorry.  I'm not going to puke on you.  That would make me...  Get off me, fucking Edgar.  No, you said I could take your puke. 
[03:00:30]  Just not in the face.  I'll let you puke right here.  That's just...  Out of chest.  So I have to smell it.  What the...  This is just weird.  It is weird, but I don't want you to fucking think you got one on me.  It's weird that you had the sentence...  Stop touching me, Edgar.  That's it, Edgar.  That you just said, I'll let you puke on my upper chest.  Bring her right in.  Bring her right in.  All right, move over there, Bobby.  Big Ange.  How you doing, Big Ange?  Ooh, that's a lot of guys.  God damn, Big Ange.  Yeah, take a seat.  Take a seat right there.  We're live on the air.  Take a seat right there.  Oh, nice small ass. 
[03:01:00]  There you go.  I didn't realize your ass was...  Oh, sorry.  What's that?  Look at, she's got a nice ass.  Because the boobies are big, so sometimes you think the rest is big.  But no, it's nice.  That's a compliment.  I know it sounds a little weird.  Hello.  Big Ange, bigger is better.  In studio.  That's Bob Kelly to your right.  Hi, Bob.  Nice to meet you.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  This is too early for me.  It is.  It's early for us.  And we've been doing this a long time.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  So what the hey-ho?  What are you up to?  You got the show.  People are watching it, right?  Well, today was on Channel 11 News at 8 o'clock this morning.  How did that work out?  I'm on the roll since 7 this morning.  Wow.  It was good.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Had fun.  Now, how did you get this show?  This voice.  Oh, oh, the show.  No, the show.  How did you get this?  This voice?  I don't know.  Now, you were a spinoff from?  Mob Wives.  Mob Wives, right.  So now-  I was only supposed to be on Mob Wives for six episodes.  Don't ask me what happened. 
[03:02:00]  I won't ask you nothing.  What was your connection to Mob Wives?  How was your relationship to Mob Wives?  Don't use the word connection.  Jennifer Graciano came to me and said,  Would you like to try out six episodes?  I said, okay, I'll try.  But family-wise, who were you related to that made you-  A Mob Wive.  A Mob Wive.  Oh, my uncle Sally Dogs.  Sally Dogs?  Sally Dogs.  I know Sally Dogs.  Hey, Sally Dogs.  I know Sally Dogs.  What kind of hijinks and shenanigans was he pulling?  He was into some things.  What did he do?  Some things?  Yeah, well, he was in jail for 22 years. 
[03:02:30]  He died two years ago.  Oh, banana.  In jail.  Oh, did he, huh?  Sorry to hear.  Yeah.  Did you really know him?  Yeah.  Sally Dogs.  He's a legend.  Yeah.  Did he-  What's his?  Did he off a few people?  You don't know Sally Dogs?  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  So then, I guess you stood out so much on the Mob Wives.  So, this is how it happens.  I did the six episodes.  From there, I stood 17.  From there, I got a spinoff. 
[03:03:00]  From there, I got a book.  And now, possibly a movie.  I don't know what's happening here.  A movie.  Now, what's your-  Jeez.  I love-  I love the voice.  What's the-  What's the-  What's the life like now?  What are you doing now?  Chaos.  Insane.  Yeah?  You should only see what it's like walking in the streets.  A lot of people recognize you now?  Everywhere they go, all morning.  Really?  They want to take pictures?  Every day. 
[03:03:30]  Do people look at your chest ever?  Do you get mad if somebody looks at your chest?  No.  Here, look.  Those are giant tits.  Wow, those are giant.  Holy moly.  Yeah.  Those are like almost-  Almost, uh, I'll go with footballs.  I said they're like-  I was going to say basketball.  They're a little smaller than basketball.  Are those fake?  They're more like a honeydew.  Honeydew.  Honeydew melons.  Whoa.  Big eggs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like honeydew melons.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So-  I think sweet.  So now, at what age did you start getting cosmetic surgery? 
[03:04:00]  Like-  25.  25.  What made you decide at 25 you wanted to start doing things?  Oh, my tits were in my waist, I decided.  At 25 they were?  That's crazy.  Well, I had the baby, and that's what happened.  Oh, okay.  Everything falls.  Everything just fell, so you decided to bring it back up.  Bring it back.  Has your voice always been like this?  Yes, it's terrible.  I smoked a brown cigarette for 35 years.  Oh, my God.  Is that a code for a black man?  I'm trying to quit.  I want to quit.  I'm going to go to the doctor to quit.  Yeah? 
[03:04:30]  Why don't you use the patch?  That's what I did.  I did it, too.  Did that, too.  Didn't work.  Didn't work, huh?  Didn't work.  What's going to work, you think?  They said I'm going to get something in the ear.  Something in the ear?  Oh, Captain, they put creatures in our bodies.  What can they put in the ear?  Listen, when I went on Extra the other day with AJ.  Years ago, it would have been a 38.  I went on Extra with AJ the other day.  Yeah.  Benza?  And he said he's sending me to a doctor.  He smoked 23 years, and he quit.  So I'm going to try it. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, man.  How much do you smoke a day?  Like a pack.  Oh, okay.  But 35 years, the same brand.  Are you married?  What do you smoke?  Benza and Hedges?  What, do you smoke more?  Yeah.  Wait, where's your husband?  Your husband's here?  Where's your husband?  More.  Do you know how hard it is to get them?  Nobody carries that.  No one has more anymore.  What the fuck?  Every one of my stores in my neighborhood get them for me.  Oh, they got them just for you.  For Big Ange.  We get them more for you.  Pick it up.  It's perfect for you.  We get them more.  Yeah, of course.  Right?  Of course. 
[03:05:30]  We can't see Ange's eyes.  Yeah.  What kind of eyes you got?  You got the bangs in your eyes.  There you go.  Nice eyes.  This Big Ange is all right, man.  Where's the husband?  He's in there.  In there.  In there.  Do you guys fight a lot, or do you get along well?  No, we don't fight.  I don't fight.  You don't fight?  I just throw his ass out.  Ah, there you go.  How long have you been together?  There's no fight.  How long have you been together?  I'm married three years.  Three years?  And I was separated, too.  Wait, so what does he do?  He's a sanitation worker.  Oh, right. 
[03:06:00]  There you go.  I need a pension.  That's a waste management.  Waste management.  I need a pension.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wasn't getting one with a wise guy.  No, we speak.  No.  All you get is a debt letter.  Oh, shit.  But we speak that language.  We understand what's going on, baby.  Hey, what are you going to do?  Did you grow up in Brooklyn?  Avenue U.  Avenue U.  Avenue U.  Brooklyn in the herd.  Yeah, I think I lived on Avenue U for a little while.  Yeah.  But maybe eight, nine years ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Where?  In Brooklyn.  That is so the new one.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember the cross.  No, it's a pretty long avenue.  Yeah, it is a long-ass avenue.  What's your poison?  Do you drink at all?  Do you put down a few?  Oh, no, not me.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, yeah.  She rolls her eyes.  What do you like?  You own a bar.  What do you think?  You like a little wine?  You drink a little red wine, right?  I drink red wine.  I drink Patron.  Patron.  I drink espresso martinis.  I drink anything.  I drink anything.  Where's your bar? 
[03:07:00]  I'm drinking Jameson.  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  Where's your bar?  Where's your bar?  Staten Island.  Of course it is.  It's a monkey.  All right.  You know what?  We're New Yorkers, and I don't know anything about Staten Island.  No one knows anything about Staten Island.  It's the last bastion of a bunch of fucking kids.  No one goes there unless you live there.  You know, Staten Island comes to my bar.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  People are coming from all over the world to my bar now.  Yeah.  It's very popular.  That's kind of cool.  Staten Island has the hottest chicks.  Yeah.  I mean, fucking, like, what the fuck? 
[03:07:30]  I did a club out there, Uncle Vinny's, in the theater out there.  I used to go to the Starbucks before the show.  There was just hot chick after fucking smoking hot chick.  Yeah, big hair.  Ugh.  All these little Italian girls.  Totally young, right?  Yeah, but some of them were a little old.  It didn't matter.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Did you have a good shot with them?  No.  I don't have a shot with anybody.  Oh, shit.  How about a lot older, she says.  How old is she?  Do you have a daughter or a son?  I have a daughter.  She'll be 28.  Hot.  Oh, cool.  Yeah?  She married?  Very good looking.  28? 
[03:08:00]  So Ange is up there.  You don't look like you're up there, Ange.  I have a son, 23.  Very good looking.  So you're a 28-year-old daughter.  Let's stick with her.  She's not married.  She's a school teacher in Marine Park in Brooklyn.  Oh, right.  Look at you.  Everyone's sticking around Brooklyn.  Does she have the big personality like you?  Oh, Staten Island.  She lives with me.  Really?  Well, teacher salary.  Of course she lives with Big Ange.  Are the girls jealous from the other show?  She's also a bartender in my bar on Friday nights.  Ange, are the girls jealous from the other show because you're such a hit now? 
[03:08:30]  They say they're not.  Oh, they're not.  Yeah, but they are.  They are.  You still keep in touch with them at all?  Yeah, I was actually with Drita yesterday.  We've had them on.  Drita.  Drita.  We've had them on.  A few of them, yeah.  What's this book about it?  Are we going to learn anything cool?  Probably not.  Bigger is better.  She don't need no money.  That's the book.  Big Ange.  Bigger is better.  It's just fun.  It's about, you know, when I was arrested.  Oh, what happened there? 
[03:09:00]  Give us a little arrest story for you.  I figured you'd like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Why were you arrested?  What do you think?  Uh-oh.  I would say D-Wee.  What?  D-Wee.  Let's guess.  D-Wee?  D-Wee?  Drunk driving.  Assault.  No.  Assault and battery.  What do you think?  I don't want to buy a kid drunk driving.  That's true.  All right.  All right.  Assault and battery.  No.  No assault?  Cocaine.  Oh, shit.  Dealing coke.  You are hardcore.  Nice. 
[03:09:30]  I did house arrest.  Yeah.  For how long?  How much time?  Four months.  The rest.  But we'll keep it in the colored areas.  Let them lose their souls.  They're animals anyway.  Right?  He's funny.  He's funny.  He should go to one of his parties over at his house.  Oh, they're hilarious.  We don't even know where we live.  It's what house.  I'm out of Long Island.  Oh.  Oh, you don't like Long Island?  What's wrong with Long Island?  I was there.  You always get lost over there?  There's only one way in and out.  I don't know those streets.  I'm confused.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's one way.  My son is actually, I'm going to start going to Long Island. 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  He's in a drug program in Long Island.  Oh, yeah?  The Phoenix.  Was he having trouble with the drugs?  Yeah, huh?  Oh, sorry.  Do you feel guilty about that at all?  Maybe it could have been a, you know.  No, don't take bills.  No?  I didn't say I was taking the drugs.  I said I was selling the drugs.  She was smart.  How long ago did you get arrested?  You have to keep a clear head if you're selling that shit.  When you take them, you're a loser.  Yeah.  When you sell them, you'll make them moolah.  Right. 
[03:10:30]  Holy shit.  How long ago did you get arrested for it?  Oh, 11 years ago.  Oh, all right.  That's a while ago.  You know, things were bad.  You got to do what you got to do.  You got to do what you got to do, you know?  I said take care of your family.  They're not going to take care of you.  Come on, Karen.  We're alone here.  They're not going to take care of us.  Hey, I got a question.  How are the lips?  Does that hurt to do?  I did the lips 12 years ago.  But does it hurt to get injections?  It does.  Fucking hurts.  Does it?  Really?  What are they, just injections?  It goes right in your eyes to to it.  Holy shit.  Really?  Yeah.  You have to keep getting it for the rest of your life? 
[03:11:00]  No, I got it.  No, I said, let me just do it all at once.  Give me five.  What is five, man?  Holy shit.  Five tubes.  Five tubes.  People get like one.  I'm like, give me a little here, a little here.  I go, what's that going to do?  You're wasting your money.  You got to bang it out all at once.  Five tubes.  Five tubes.  I left the place.  I left the place.  I was like, oh, I'm like there.  Holy shit.  Black and blue.  Well, my lips were this big.  I was like, what the fuck?  I look like Daffy Duck.  What am I going to do? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, man.  And I was going to have my 40th birthday.  Oh, man.  In Staten Island.  Of course.  I was like panicking, ice packs, everything.  But this is it.  12 years later, still here.  See, it worked.  Now, do you have to get little booster shots every so often?  That's been like that for 12 years?  You're good.  Holy mother of pearl.  I hope they don't go away.  She likes the big lips.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're sexy.  I like them too.  I like big lips.  Now, you'd rather have lips like this or... 
[03:12:00]  Little bird lips?  Who sees the teeth?  You can't even imitate small lips, though.  Look at you.  You just went like that.  And you still have more lips.  You know when they have to know lips and the lips like stuck to their gum?  Oh, man.  You don't want that.  I'd rather have this.  Bobby, you got a question for Big Edge?  No, it was just when she was talking about little lips.  Little Jimmy started licking his lips like, I like little lips.  I like lips too.  Does Jimmy have big lips?  Does Jimmy have big lips?  They're nice when you got a kiss.  Look at Jimmy's lips.  I have small lips.  Jimmy's been known to have the sexiest fucking...  No, I purse them, though.  Oh, Jimmy.  You need to have five tubes. 
[03:12:30]  Look at them purse.  Ew.  When I make the percy face, girls like it.  Huh?  They are very little.  They look like they're a drawn.  You know, men do get it.  Five tubes, Jimmy.  What do you think?  You got five tubes?  I should get five tubes, but only in the top.  I should leave the bottom as it is.  You'd look like a platypus.  What else about this book, Big Edge?  We got to sell some books for you.  We got to rest it.  Oh, yeah.  You better sell my books.  You got the whole story about you getting arrested in there.  I talk about...  Short chapters.  I like that. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, it's nice.  What about some of that, your uncle there?  Some of that mobbed up shit.  Let's not talk about that.  Let's not talk about that.  Well, if you got any in there, that's okay.  It's no secret.  He was a legend, man.  I think I talk about...  Yeah, he was a good guy.  Yeah?  I think I talk about, like, when I went out with Wise Guys, they bought me million dollar houses.  Oh, nice.  Really?  Now, I got to beg for a Chanel bag.  What the fuck?  I'm not used to this shit.  You're making your old money.  They bought me businesses and houses and furs and cars. 
[03:13:30]  Wow.  You dated a lot of Wise Guys with you, like, coming up?  I did.  Are they good boyfriends?  I thought they were the best.  Yeah, huh?  Began, Joey.  Every day's your birthday.  How could that be good?  Mafia guys know how to take care of people.  Oh, they certainly do.  Hey, I worked at a golf...  I say it a lot.  I worked at a golf course with a lot of mob guys.  They were way cooler and nicer and took care of us more than the legit guys.  Yeah, of course.  They're cheap. 
[03:14:00]  They're fucking the worst.  The ones that carry wallets are very cheap.  Only like guys that have rubber bands.  Sorry!  Oh, yeah?  Put the bin on the outside.  Mingy.  If you're pulling out a wallet, I ain't going out with you.  Do they keep receipts for tax purposes?  But I do lately.  Oh, shit.  I got receipts.  Oh, well, you know, now you can write that off.  You write that off.  I have.  Government allows you to do that. 
[03:14:30]  That's all I do is shop.  I need to close the show.  Right.  The big show.  Clothes are a tough one to write off.  Clothes are a tough one.  She's in entertainment.  Unless you're a clown or unless it's something you can only wear at...  What, a clown like I make you laugh?  I mean, then you can only wear...  I love that for you.  Of course.  It's great.  Listen.  You need to wear different clothes every day because you're on camera.  Right.  See?  You got to buy a lot of shit.  Oh, you got legit.  You're legit.  You're legit as far as that goes.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't you worry about that. 
[03:15:00]  You write that off.  You don't want to end up like fucking Al Capone in jail for taxes.  Or syphilis.  Yeah.  Or the clap, right?  And so it talks about like all my friends talking the book, my daughter, my son, my  sisters and brothers.  So you had everyone else write the book for you.  No, little chap.  You're close with the family?  You're close with your family?  I'm very close with my family.  Yeah?  You do the holidays over...  Every Sunday we...  Every Sunday.  Make sauce.  You make sauce.  Oh, it tells you my sauce.  No, you make the gravy.  You make the gravy.  It's called gravy.  I call it sauce. 
[03:15:30]  I hate that.  Gravy or sauce?  I don't know who calls it gravy.  Gravy.  Sauce.  Gravy?  Gravy's brown.  Hey, man.  A lot of the guys call it gravy.  Marron.  I call it sauce.  It's sauce.  Don't make me fucking prove it.  Listen to me.  Some people do.  I put the sauce with the pig's feet.  Oh, man.  Oh.  That's good.  How does Bobby walk?  Big Ange.  I really am a great guy.  He pissed off Jimmy.  He's leaving.  This is funny.  I have a flight to catch.  You guys do.  I loved him talking to you, though.  It was fun.  Well, that's what he says.  I enjoyed you very much. 
[03:16:00]  Do you have your lucky hat?  Oh.  Do you have your lucky hat, Jim?  Hang on.  A little nice, Peg.  Where are you going?  I don't want your husband to knock my teeth out, though.  Just take another one.  He's got to go pick up some cocaine from those Pittsburgh guys.  Did he get that?  I got it.  A little Peg.  Nice, gentlemanly.  I hope this is the end of you.  I know.  Can I?  All of a sudden, you don't know.  Kenny's like, Jim never made it downstairs.  You can find my fucking sneaker behind the curtain.  You're going to Pittsburgh.  On top of Bobby's sandwich.  I'm going to Irvine, California to work.  I'm on Instagram now.  It's a sneaker.  Not about you.  Jimmy, one more time.  Only if it's okay with Ange.  Ange, one more time. 
[03:16:30]  Hide me.  I was doing the kissing.  Is he okay with it?  Okay.  He's a big fucking guy.  All right, good.  Is he a big guy?  Not only is he big, he's in shape.  He's not fucking around.  Come on.  You've got to hold the pose for a picture.  He's laughing very uncomfortable in there.  He don't care.  He's not jealous.  Why is he Bobby Senator?  He just pulled all the guns.  He's waving.  He didn't get it.  It wasn't even how to use it.  Bobby Senator.  Really?  Is he a total regular guy?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  He's Irish.  Oh, shit.  Irish.  A fucking Mick.  You're all right with that. 
[03:17:00]  God damn.  They got worse tempers than the Italians.  He's Irish.  Well, listen to me, my Kraut Mick friend.  He's laughing.  I hope so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm all guinea.  I keep looking at him.  I'm all wop.  I want you to sign my book.  Bye, guys.  Yeah, take it easy, Jimmy.  Have fun.  Bye, Jimmy.  Jimmy's in Irvine.  You doing any book signings or anything here?  Yeah?  Where are you going to be?  Oh, I'm going to Barnes & Noble in Tribeca today at 6.

You look at her fucking tits.  You walk away.  Get out of here.  What kind of fucking people are they?  Fucking tits.  She's got lips.  She's a car.  What the fuck?  Husband's a motherfucking cocksucker.  Kissing fucking no lip.  Jimmy in the mouth like a bird.  He's a fucking bird kissing a goddess.  He really is a bird, isn't he?  Like the littlest lip. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, she tried to feed him.  Tiny little lips.  She tried to feed the cocksucker like a fucking baby bird.  The contrast was hilarious on those lips.  Oh, my God.  She kissed his nose and his chin.  Almost sucked his face in.  Yeah, he did, Edge.  That was close.  Big Edge almost took out his face.  That was a close one.  We got to go, really?  We got to tie it up.  Well, because we got the after show.  Oh, it's not the scheduling.  I don't want to go there.  But let me tell you.  You're very funny.  I don't want to go there.  Fantastic.

But if you don't do good, you run about the fucking back.  I've done shows for mob guys before.  The last thing you want is a six-foot-six guy named Moosey. 
[03:19:30]  You better be funny.  No, you should go.  We don't have that in my bar.  We have the Irish crowd.  All right.  You do something funny for Angelo.  Just fucking laugh at him or something.

Oh, nice.  Joe the barber.  The guy goes, meet me down at Ming's.  I go, Ming's has been closed for 10 years.

He's got his mother and his wife in the back cooking with the Ming, the Chinese guy.  I'm doing a show.  I'm doing a show there.  I bring this kid to just bomb in front of me.  He's Italian.  He's got fucking 10 minutes of the best Italian jokes. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, he's killing.  I've ever heard.  They carry him out.  You know, when Italian guys, when they like you, they'll kiss you more than fucking gay  guys.  I love this fucking...  They carry him out, and then I got to go up, and the main guy, Joe the barber, turns  the chair around in front of me, right in the front row, and they're all just staring  at me.  And it was the guys and their wives, not their chicks.  Right.  So this was the night.  Yeah, yeah.  This was a serious night.  Yeah, the wives were there.  And I go up, and I'm like, what the fuck? 
[03:21:00]  I go, where's Ming?  And they go, he's in the kitchen!  And they grab a Chinese dude, an old Chinese dude, out of the kitchen, and throw him on  stage at me.  He lost...  Holy shit, I would have used him as a prop.  That's nice.  I did.  I did for 20 minutes.  I fucking made fun of this Chinese dude.  Chinese prop.  Every Asian joke in the world I did.  I think Chinese jokes could be very funny.  Yeah, of course they can.  Of course.  Of course.  Are we getting the wrap-up?  What?  We got to get big hands out of here?  Wrap-up?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to leave. 
[03:21:30]  I just...  I know, right?  Having fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's always too short, isn't it?  Bye.  All right, Ange.  Thank you.  Bigger is better.  The book, and of course, the show.

[03:25:30]  Let me put some headphones on so I can hear you.  Brian Posehn.  I've got a big audition today.  Brian Posehn's coming by in a little bit.  All right, I'm going to leave when he comes.  Okay.  Who's Brian Posehn?  You know Brian Posehn.  He's a famous comedian.  He's been in a bunch of shit.  He's been in a ton of sitcoms, guest spots.  He's in Devil's Rejects.  Mr. Show.  What did you say, Eric?  He does a lot of stuff with Zach Galifianakis.  Comedians, a comedy tour.  Yeah, he was on Mr. Show.  He was on Sarah Silverman's show.  You know.  I don't.  Well, then you've got to fucking step your comedy game up. 
[03:26:00]  Well, here's the deal, man.  Yeah, man.  I'm a face guy.  Talk to me.  I'm not a fucking name guy.  Talk to me, Bobby.  I'm a face guy.  Yeah.  I see a face, I go, bing, bang.  I know to make the connections.  Right, I see.  That's the way.  That's old Hollywood.  Okay?  You're kind of an old Hollywood guy.  I'm not this new Hollywood where you've got names and Twitters and Facebookses.  I know old Hollywood.  I know names, motherfuckers.  I know faces.  What kind of audition do you have going today?  Oh, dude.  It's for a big show.  It's a big show.  I know him.  He's great.  Yeah.  I love him.  It's for a TV show? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  No, it's for a fucking play.  Vaudeville.  They do auditions for film as well.  So it could be television or film.  It's for a television show.  Yeah.  A hit show.  A new show.  How can it be a hit then?  Huh?  How can it be a hit show if it's a new show?  Because it's new.  They come out of the gate hot.  It's going to be a hit?  Like Presumed Innocent?  That shit's hot out of the gate.  You watch Sons of Anarchy?  You know, I got fucking mad at that show, man.  When?  I don't know.  I got kind of holier than thou when I watched the last episode.  Oh, this brand new one? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, when they burned the little girl.  Spoiler alert for anyone who hadn't seen it.  Look, here's my theory on a spoiler.  Two days ago.  A movie, I give you credit.  If it's a TV show and you haven't watched it, it's been two days, you're a fucking ass.  It's like a big show, though.  You're taking advantage of fucking, you're taking advantage of DVR.  Uh-huh.  If you haven't, a day.  How long is the DVR?  Two days.  You've got two days.  Okay.  If you haven't watched it by today, you're taking advantage of it.  You're abusing it. 
[03:27:30]  Weird.  Sound effects.  Sorry, I didn't know.  Just making fun of you.  But you thought it was, it was definitely the darkest they've gone on Sons of Anarchy.  I got mad, dude.  I was like, there was no need for that.  There was no need for the extent that they showed that.  I didn't like it.  I got mad.  I stopped watching it.  You didn't watch the rest of the episode?  I didn't watch it.  As soon as that happened, I left.  What are you getting offended about?  I didn't get offended.  I don't know if it's offended.  I got appalled.  I was just like, what the fuck, man?  But don't they need to take it to the dark place? 
[03:28:00]  I mean, they kidnapped his baby before.  What else are they going to do?  Yeah, but they could have done that without doing what they did.  I guess you didn't need to see the little girl running back and forth while she was flaming  on fire.  Dude.  And who would have thought that little dude in the wheelchair from Oz was that vicious?  It's just...  I was like, he's from actually more recently from Lost.  I know.  I don't watch Lost, though.  Yeah, dude.  It really fucked me up.  I mean, I don't mean to say...  It was a brutal scene, but...  It wasn't brutal. 
[03:28:30]  They wouldn't even have put that scene in a movie.  No, it was really...  Name a movie that has a scene that brutal.  It would have to be like hostile.  Not even hostile has...  That's a horror movie.  I'm talking about a regular movie where they had something that fucking brutal and detailed.  Where they had that...  I mean, screaming daddy.  What the fuck?  Well, what happened on the show was this biker...  You know, keep in mind, he ran down this...  Last season, he ran down this dude's daughter, not realizing it was his daughter or whatever. 
[03:29:00]  It was an accident.  He killed her, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  She went through a plate glass window and she died.  So, what he didn't realize was her father is this big gangster.  Like, he's the leader of all black gangs in whatever, California.  Yeah, he's Obama.  And so he kidnaps...  So he kidnaps this biker's daughter and he locks her up in this little thing underground  and then he sets her on fire while the biker is handcuffed to a pole.  It's the way he did it.  Now, they could have...  Okay, they could have poured the gasoline... 
[03:29:30]  We got some calls for you, Bob.  A couple people.  Are they mad because I fucking ruined it?  James?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  What the fuck, Bobby?  You fucking ruined sons of anarchy for me.  You did just jump right into it.  You know, when he burned that little girl.  Listen, dude.  First of all, look, I apologize, but don't abuse time.  John, John.  That's what you're doing.  You're abusing time.  John, welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  You know what, dude? 
[03:30:00]  I'm a truck driver.  I can't get home for a couple weeks, dude.  Oh, shit.  You fucked it up, Barney.  I always forget about truck drivers' lives.  Yeah, I forget about...  Dude, I'm sorry.  First of all, step your game up.  Get a TV in your truck with satellite with a little bunk bed in the back.  Yeah, what are you doing?  So you and your lot lizard can watch the show on time.  I mean, I get...  I have a little hookup named Rolando's.  So I got to have the episode on DVD a couple weeks ago, but I didn't come in here and be  Is that code for Roland?  Roland.  That's his name.  You didn't know that?  Rolando is his name? 
[03:30:30]  I...  Look, man.  Seriously.  First of all, if you...  The DVR thing, if you're waiting two weeks to see the show, fuck you.  It's two days.  I don't care.  Because it literally premiered on September 11th, and it's now September 13th.  I don't care.  It hasn't even been 48 hours since the show was on.  It doesn't matter.  You should have watched it yesterday.  You literally gave people less than 36 hours to watch the show.  Yes.  You know what, dude?  Actually, wait.  36 hours from right now.  Literally at this moment.  People are putting their lives on pause.  36 hours.  Pause.  Back when I was a kid, you watched the show on Monday, or you didn't get to see it. 
[03:31:00]  Because DVR didn't exist.  For 10 years.  VCRs didn't exist.  For 10 years, you didn't get to see that show.  You understand?  If you missed a Brady Bunch episode, you didn't see it for 10 years.  I mean, listen, Bobby.  You're old Hollywood, and a lot of people don't understand that.  I'm old Hollywood.  I recognize faces.  Great.  Greg in D.C.  Welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, you know what, dude?  I can name three movies off the top of my head that are more brutal than that. 
[03:31:30]  First, Man on Fire.  Boom!  What?  They put a bunch of tires around a guy.  They light him on fire.  He burns.  He rolls down a hill.  They shove a bomb up a guy's ass.  They light other people on fire.  Bomb up a guy's ass.  They're all dead.  Yeah, but they don't show you the guy being blown up.  They do.  They do.  They don't.  They do.  They don't.  What's the other movie?  You don't see the guy getting blown up.  The guy with the thing in his ass.  He turns around.  He walks away.  And then you never see the guy attached to the car being blown up. 
[03:32:00]  Ever.  We're doing rational, Bobby.  Okay.  You light.  Don't see the guy blow up.  People have figured out the depths of you.  But he's on fire.  How about Money Train?  Money Train.  Awful, awful movie, but they squirt gasoline inside and light someone on fire.  You see the fire.  You see the fire, Bobby.  Money Train.  We're talking about a child screaming, daddy, daddy, help me.  A child screaming, daddy, daddy.  Let's go back in time to when Bobby was sucking dick. 
[03:32:30]  Aw, why'd you have to take it?  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  I love you.  We're going to go back to last week?  Go ahead.  Okay.  Any movie having to deal with Mexican cartels, especially lately, anything in Oz.  Oh, my God.  Oz, when you see people getting their legs broken and things like that.  There's some crazy shit on that show, Bobby.  Okay, I think Oz, I mean, you might have a point with Oz.  I never really watched Oz, so I can't say that.  Great show.  But this scene and this. 
[03:33:00]  Bobby, it's okay.  Here's the thing, too, is that they're saying these guys.  I can buy that the bikey lifestyle.  Bikey?  That's what they are, bikers.  Bikey, though?  It's a biker lifestyle.  I say bikey.  Do you think they would ever go like, we're going to get on our bikeys?  Sam, old Hollywood.  That's what they used to call them, bikeys.  They used to call it bikey back then?  They used to call them bikeys.  All right.  Bikeys, you don't know that.  I didn't know, because I'm not an old...  And then they changed it to biker.  I'm kind of this new, kind of young, flashy generation.  Back in the day, it was only a couple guys in the gang. 
[03:33:30]  It was bikeys.  I see.  And there was bikes.  They started with bikes.  And then it was bikey.  Then it was biker.  Then it was biker.  Yeah, I kept going.  But here's the thing, is that, listen, this scene in this show was too much.  It was too much.  Because here's the thing, they're saying the cartels, okay, the bikey gangs, these guys  are killing people.  They're killing people.  And what are they, protect Charmin?  That's how we're supposed to say this is okay? 
[03:34:00]  Real biker gangs, drugs, guns, and kill people and rape people.  Right.  I don't think, I don't buy into that.  They're the angels of Charmin.  But here's the thing, is these guys, exactly, they protect Charmin so they can have your  cafe latte.  So you decided that in this one scene, you're giving up on the whole premise of the show?  I'm not giving up on the premise of the show, but I think they went, I, it was disturbing  to watch.  I had to walk out of the room.  All these people are with other movies.  You don't want, because the rape scene in Last House on the left, that was awful.  Beautiful scene.  You loved it.  I've masturbated to it many of times. 
[03:34:30]  I hope that's not true.  The original or the remake?  Which one do you prefer?  Original, man.  You like that.  Yeah, because the remake wasn't as good.  You didn't like it as much?  No.  The rape scene itself or the movie?  The rape scene.  You didn't see the whole thing.  I only watched it up to the rape scene in both movies.  What else?  He did get some, you know, vengeance after the incident.  Look, man, it doesn't.  And it sets up the season.  It doesn't matter, dude.  That was a, that was a brutal scene that they could have stopped.  They could have cut. 
[03:35:00]  You know when they could have cut it?  When he lit the fire.  And you could have heard screams, and that's it.  I guess he wanted to get your emotions.  They got it.  They got it.  Because I really got mad.  I was like, and it has to do with probably a kid, a father.  I mean, it probably stirs.  I don't like when kids get hurt in shows.  But that's the thing.  You're supposed to get so angry because these are the most evil people ever.  Not on a fucking Sunday night in my house.  It's not Sunday.  It's Tuesday.  I don't want to fucking do that.  I could turn on the regular news if I want to get all fucked up and emotional. 
[03:35:30]  Let's not get political here, Bobby.  Well, listen, man.  Political Bob isn't coming on the show.  But what I'm saying is, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want it.  I don't need it.  I watch this shit to escape, not to fucking feel like shit.  Yeah, but it's not supposed to be so dark.  Just watch, you know, Yo Gabba Gabba.  And you'll feel all good.  I like Sons of Anarchy.  I just don't think they needed to go that far.  Brian Posehn.  Brian Posehn.  What's up, man?  What's up?  I got to fly.  I'll see you guys later.  You're Levity Live tonight.  Levity Live tonight.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  It's in the Palisades Mall in West Niagara. 
[03:36:00]  I've been there a bunch of times.  Why don't you come?  I should come.  It's my, it's right by Westchester.  Please.  Bye, buddy.  Thanks, Bobby.  Take it easy, man.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  How's it going, man?  Sit down.  Right here?  Yeah, sure.  We're live on the air.  We're transitioning as we go.  Awesome.  You just got off a plane, huh?  Yeah, about four hours ago, yeah.  Then you had to sit in the lobby.  I was reading your Twitter.  Oh, yes.  You had to sit in the lobby of the hotel?  Uh-huh.  You didn't get early check-in or anything like that? 
[03:36:30]  No, I'm an idiot.  I did it so last minute, and then I was a crybaby about it on Twitter.  You're just like, I'll complain about it.  It's my own fault, but I'll complain about it.  Well, you're doing Caroline's this weekend.  Yes.  How often are you in New York?  It's been a while.  I haven't been at Caroline's in several years.  Yeah.  I was doing comics until...  Is that still around?  I don't think so.  I think that is in the dirt.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you're there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:37:00]  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Two shows.  Friday, two shows, Saturday, and then Sunday.  So it's carolines.com.  Everybody knows where Caroline's is.  It's here in Manhattan.  But I love your career, because it seems like you've just gotten to do...  At some point, you decided you're just going to do everything that you like.  You know what I mean?  Because you're a guy who likes metal, and you like comic books and stuff like that, and that's  kind of what you do now.  It's crazy.  But it was never like I decided to do that.  And I sort of lucked into everything.  And it's just through hanging out, really. 
[03:37:30]  Like being around metal guys, and then they were like, hey, we should write some stupid  songs.  You know, that kind of thing.  Yes.  And then hanging out with comic book guys.  And I recently got a gig at Marvel, basically through...  You have an actual gig at Marvel?  Yeah, I'm doing a full year of Deadpool.  Wow.  It comes out in November.  And yeah, that's totally insane to me.  Like being like a comic book geek my whole life, and then just sort of hanging out with  them at Comic-Con every year in San Diego.  And then eventually them going, you should take over the book. 
[03:38:00]  And I was like, all right.  You're a recognizable guy.  How is it?  Because I always see you like...  Because we've been...  I went to Comic-Con with Norton for the last couple years.  And we always kind of see you in passing.  And I go, oh, we should...  And then, you know, we don't end up crossing paths.  But do you get recognized like constantly the whole time you're there?  Yeah, at that place.  Especially because that's your crowd, kind of.  Yeah, I'm sort of the mayor there.  Or one of the mayors.  Yeah.  What do you like at Comic-Con?  What do I like?  I don't buy too many books anymore. 
[03:38:30]  But that used to be the thing.  And now, since you've been there, I mean, it's mostly about movies and other stuff now.  But for me, it's like the hang.  Yeah.  You know, it's a chance once a year to see a bunch of dudes that I never get to see  and just hang out and talk about stupid stuff.  So how do you approach now, like, as a comic book fan, as a ridiculous comic book fan who  it's like, this is kind of your dream gig.  How do you go forward writing a comic book?  Do you write just what you want?  Do you think about the audience?  Do you...  Both. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.  I'm writing with my writing partner that I've written some other comic books with.  And we always look at everything as, you know, what would we want to read, really?  You know, like, what would we do with these guys with this character, Deadpool, that would  make us laugh and make us pick up the book if we hadn't been reading it for a while?  Like, that's the main thing, is we want to bring new people to the book, people that  used to read it and haven't picked it up in years, and then people that, like, might 
[03:39:30]  just see my name on it, you know, and then want them to stick around.  That's, like, the real idea, you know.  And do all these, like, do all these connections end up coming through comedy, or are they people  who have seen you in odd spots, like, people who saw you in Mr. Show, like, years ago,  and they're like, oh!  Yeah, it's both, but, I mean, with metal, it's sort of everything.  It's, like, you know, the stand-up, and then also a lot of Mr. Show fans, like, that one  being a thing I learned really early on is a lot of those guys were watching Mr. Show,  you know, DVDs on the bus and stuff.  Like, that's how I got in with the anthrax. 
[03:40:00]  It's crazy when you find out that those guys are watching your stuff.  Yeah, and then I've met, like, death metal bands, like, really scary bands, you know,  like, it's like, you guys have a sense of humor?  Yeah, we just love having a laugh and hanging out on the bus.  Yeah, they were murdering goats.  Standing in front of a pentagram all day.  Sacrificed it.  Yeah, yeah.  Just watching your DVDs.  Right.  Makes you question yourself.  Yeah, I always get jealous, because I'm, like, a giant wrestling geek, and I always get 
[03:40:30]  jealous when wrestlers come in here, and Norton's here, and they don't know who I am, but they're  like, Jim, I love your comedy, and I'm like, oh, fuck, I gotta do something.  Is he even a wrestling fan?  No, he doesn't care.  He doesn't at all.  He doesn't care at all, but these guys, and that probably makes it easier for them to be  like, yeah, I'm a big fan of your work.  Right.  Do you have to curtail?  Without having him nerd out on them.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you ever have to curtail your fanboyness around, like, when you meet guys that you  love?  Sometimes, yeah, because with the metal guys, you don't want to go, oh my god, I love you  so much.  They're like, what?  So what was it like when, yeah, you have to kind of try to be like, okay, human interactions, 
[03:41:00]  don't just ask him about himself the whole time, and like, obscure album questions and  stuff like that.  What was the first person that you got to meet in that?  When did it kind of start happening where people were coming up to you and being like,  oh yeah, I like your stuff, we should do something?  God, it's been a while now.  Yeah.  Like, right after Mr. Show was kind of when it really started, so, God, more than 10 years.  And that was, the way I met Anthrax was, for me, just being at a show by myself, because 
[03:41:30]  all my comedy friends don't listen to metal.  They're all pussies, and they all listen to, you know, like, Elvis Costello and stuff  like that, so.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, something to have, it's like metal, like, it's not the cool thing right now, is  it?  No, and it hasn't been for a long time.  Yeah, 20 years or something.  It's just you and Jim Florentine left.  Yeah.  They're listening to metal.  Our friends going, you guys still listen to that stuff? 
[03:42:00]  Like, yeah, it's fucking badass.  I liked it when I was 15.  Yeah, I did too, and I still do.  You don't give up?  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I mean, I have a couple, I, the metalheads I came up with in high school, one of them  stuck with it, and the other guy, like, got into pop music, and he's a weirdo, and me  and the other metalhead are like, what happened to him?  And then he thinks we're, you know, idiots for sticking up, liking this stuff for 30-something  years.  That's, because that's the same thing I do.  Like, that's why I'm still a wrestling geek, and still doing all this nonsense. 
[03:42:30]  I'm still buying action figures and stuff like that, because you latch onto these hobbies  as a kid, and you just refuse to give up on them.  Yeah, that's the way I am with comic books, horror movies, and all this other stuff that  I've also fallen into.  Yeah.  Well, you were in The Devil's Rejects.  Yeah.  I'm a huge Rob Zombie fan.  Like, I have a tattoo on my shoulder.  Nice.  Rob Zombie's logo, and I showed it to him when he was in here before, and he was just like,  oh, okay, that's...  Yeah, see, that's the thing we were talking about.  Yeah.  Look how you put your face...  And then I actually signed it at a signing, and I tattooed that on him. 
[03:43:00]  He's like, wow.  You like me.  This was professional a minute ago.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  How was that?  A lot of metalheads are, like, kind of introverts, too, you know?  Like, guys that got into metal, and a lot of those band guys you meet, like, you meet  guitar players, and they've spent 30 years just sitting in a room trying to get better  and better.  Right.  And then when you try to talk to them, and you have, like, high energy, I barely have  any energy, but, like, when I geek out on somebody, you know, they're like, oh, I want 
[03:43:30]  to go back to my room.  Yeah, I'm not really...  That's why I'm not a front man.  I just kind of hang in the back and do this.  Yeah.  You're a god at that.  Yeah.  But you're amazing.  What was it like being in Devil's Rejects?  And getting shot in the head.  That was a crazy thing, too.  That was a...  It was Chris Hardwick, a buddy of mine, comic.  He died in House of a Thousand Corpses, and when he did, I was like, you lucky bastard. 
[03:44:00]  And I gave him shit a couple of times when I see him, you know?  It's like, I can't believe you get to die in a horror film.  And he's like, Rob would love you, you know?  You should meet Rob.  And, you know, he's like, Rob actually watches a lot of sitcoms, so I went to a party.  And you're like the guy, but anybody who doesn't know who Brian Posehn is, you just Google  image him, because he's the quintessential, oh, I know that guy from somewhere, guy.  Because you did every sitcom when they were, like, in the big sitcom boom. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then so I went over to the house with Hardwick, and right away, Rob's like, oh, yeah, me and  my wife watched you, you know, you were funny on Everybody Loves Raymond, the news radio,  and he, like, knows all those sitcoms.  Rob Zombie and his wife just sitting chuckling, and Everybody Loves Raymond.  Yeah, it was kind of weird.  But then we became friends, and, you know, when the second movie came up, Devil's Rejects,  he had written another part for me, you know, and he told me, I want you to play a serial  killer that wears a baby into the van. 
[03:45:00]  You know, when they go to get ice cream?  Yeah.  The movie really well, when she goes to get tutti-fucking-fruity.  For sure.  There was a scene that he had written where I was a serial killer working on my own,  and I tried to kill her.  Rob loves serial killers.  Yeah.  There's not enough serial killers in my movie.  Right, and then the other badass serial killers come and save her and then kill me, and I  was like, oh, that'll be awesome.  Right, I get to die in a horror movie, and I get to be a serial killer in a horror movie.  And then that, like, didn't work, you know, it was like, it was kind of a weird scene, 
[03:45:30]  a weird couple of scenes.  So he took that out.  It's a huge coincidence for that to happen.  Really suspending disbelief.  How about if a serial killer happens to get ice cream and another serial killer is running  the ice cream truck?  Right.  It would have worked, but, yeah, that got cut, and then he goes, how about if I just, you  know, have you play a roadie and you get shot in the face?  I was like, dude, I'll do whatever.  Sounds fantastic.  Yeah.  But that scene that you're, we were just in here, Bob Kelly was just in here a minute  ago. 
[03:46:00]  You watched Sons of Anarchy?  Yeah.  Did you watch the premiere?  Uh-huh.  Bob Kelly already spoiled the scene where the girl gets burned.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where the girl gets burned alive.  We were talking about brutal scenes like that.  He said he had to turn off the show after that.  I didn't.  I thought it worked.  But.  Yeah, it didn't bother me.  I mean, I've seen everything in horror films.  It just didn't affect you whatsoever.  You're like, oh, girl's on fire.  I was jacking off to it.  Is that weird?  No, no.  Of course.  This is where my mind's gone.  It was like, finally, something I can work it to. 
[03:46:30]  It's not time.  They brought television back.  I watch girl on fire porn.  And by that, I mean just girls on fire.  But that was a brutal scene, too.  It was brutal.  The one that you were in.  Oh, yeah.  Like when he starts like shoving his gun down this chick's underpants.  Yeah.  And it's Priscilla Barnes.  Underpants.  That's a real sexy way to say it, too.  Yeah.  Girls love it when you call it that.  Yeah.  Take off your underpants.  But it's Priscilla Barnes from, you know, Three's Company.  Yeah.  So I grew up watching her. 
[03:47:00]  And it's surreal.  And then I have to play dead for two days.  Oh, yeah.  Because I did five days on the movie.  So my role in Devil's Rejects is two days of setup, one day where I get killed, and then two days where I play dead.  And you're just laying there.  Yeah.  So I got paid for two days just laying there and trying not to breathe.  It was great.  Because that was the thing.  Like he'd go by me and he'd like come over to me and go, all right, man, the camera's going to be right on you.  So you can't breathe for like a minute. 
[03:47:30]  And I'm like, okay, I'll try.  You're like, well, I'm getting paid.  I guess I should do something.  And then these people are, you know, acting out this horrible scene.  That's what I was thinking about of watching Sons of Anarchy.  That's why I guess it didn't affect me as much.  Yeah.  Is because I was thinking of the girl who's played that she's on fire.  Uh-huh.  When they're off her and they're on, what's the guy's name?  The guy playing her dad. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, his father.  Trigger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When they're on the father.  She's like probably sitting, you know, with a, you know, wearing a robe.  Yeah.  And like sitting on a director's chair and just going, oh, like off camera.  And her father's going, no, no.  And then he's got to emote.  He's got to pretend that she's on fire.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Because, yeah, it's not like she's going to be the one.  So I just, that's why it didn't affect me.  Like I was immediately out on it.  So you're totally displaced from everything.  It's amazing that you could still be a fan of all this stuff. 
[03:48:30]  And like, cause usually when somebody's let all the way behind the curtain, they kind  of give it up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  No, I still love, I still love TV and movies.  Yeah.  You know, I have a brick and bad.  I watched every episode of this year's Sons of Anarchy.  I've been waiting for.  Yeah.  So, so, but.  I still get into it, but then, yeah, there are moments like that where I'm like, oh,  that's how they did that, you know.  So you had to lie down on the floor while Bill Moseley was shoving a gun into Priscilla  Barnes' panties.  Yes.  And just kind of. 
[03:49:00]  Her underpants.  Her underpants.  There's a gun in your underpants.  And just sit there trying not to react.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  For two days.  How long have you been doing comedy for?  Oh, um, God, 26 years now.  And how long was it before things started rolling?  Like, cause I guess, was it for you, was Mr. Show like when things really.  Well, no, a little bit before that, um, I started getting, you know, back in the early  nineties, there was standup everywhere. 
[03:49:30]  If you remember, like there was, you know, uh, Comedy Central had a million standup shows.  Um, other, you know, other networks back then had, you know, there was two drink minimum.  Like my, my first time to New York was coming to shoot a show and, and I did a lot of those  and I did, uh, I did star search in the early nineties.  So back then it was like, all that stuff before Mr. Show.  You could get on TV if you were a comedian.  Yeah.  There was a lot of different opportunities for it.  But, and none of us were headliners. 
[03:50:00]  You know, I was, uh, you know, um, an opener in a middle back then.  And I, but I was, I had a bunch of TV spots like immediately because I kind of had, well,  obviously I have a look.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then I also had like this weird angle, you know, I was sort of, sort of dressed grunge  and, you know, but it was nerdy too.  Right.  You know.  And that's the other thing.  You have not given up.  Like that was not, Judah Friedlander was in here a few weeks ago and he was saying the  same thing.  He's like, yeah, I'm kind of sick of like hipsters thinking that I'm being a hipster. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  He's like, no, like, this is how I started and I got made fun of for a long time for it.  And it's kind of starting to be a little bit cool.  Well, I always hated like when alternative comedy, when we got labeled as that, because  I was doing that in front of brick walls.  You were just going to straight clubs and doing what I wanted to do.  Yeah.  I just didn't give a fuck.  I mean, well, I did.  I always wanted to get laughs, but there was also always this part of, I only want people  like me to like me. 
[03:51:00]  You know what I mean?  How did you do that early on though?  Like it was hard.  Yeah.  Because that's a lot of integrity to maintain.  No.  Well, and it wasn't, you know, it was just stubbornness really.  It was like, this shit is funny.  So I'd be in Placerville or, you know, places all around California when I first started going  up and fucking eating it and going to Oakland and eating it and going to all these other  places, but then going to San Francisco and killing.  You know, in front of like, you know, I don't want to say smart people, but you know, weirdos 
[03:51:30]  or whatever.  Right.  And then kind of finding my crowd.  Right.  So you're saying this shit is funny and I refuse to learn anything new for them.  So.  Right.  And then it took LA and it took like the alternative rooms before I finally went, oh, wow, I have  a bigger audience than I ever thought, you know.  And then Comedians of Comedy really helped with that.  But, you know, it also helped like kind of going, taking other jobs and then kind of  establishing myself as a sitcom guy before I could come back into standup and then kind  of have, you know, oh, it's that guy. 
[03:52:00]  You know what I mean?  Right.  So, yeah.  So during that time you did what?  You did, you did Friends, you did Everybody Loves Raymond.  Yeah.  News, radio.  You did an episode of Seinfeld, right?  Uh-huh.  And then I did Just Shoot Me for four years.  Right.  Of course.  And that was when you had, because the other ones you were just doing like little parts here  in there, can you make a living doing that, like just jumping on as many sitcoms as you  can?  At that point, yeah.  Yeah.  But then 10 years later, not so much.  It doesn't work anymore.  No, no.  You have to do a reality show.  But then you still get, you know, you get those residual checks forever. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  But they get smaller and smaller and smaller.  Those are hilarious.  Like every once in a while I'll call my mom and go, 22 cents today.  From Seinfeld.  Yeah, from Seinfeld.  Thanks, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think he's cashing 22 cents.  No, no.  He's probably doing all right still with it.  The checks haven't gotten that minuscule for him yet.  So, but you still enjoy doing comedy?  Is that kind of your...  Yeah, but, oh, now I do.  But I went through a point when I was writing and doing other stuff where it just wasn't 
[03:53:00]  that fun anymore.  And doing The Road was kind of a drag when you weren't a headliner.  And then, luckily I was able to, like after Comedians of Comedy, or kind of right around  that time, I started going out on my own and headlining.  And then it was way more fun.  And I guess...  Because I was actually drawing an audience.  And before, yeah, and before you do Comedians of Comedy, you don't know what the audience  is.  So you haven't found your crowd yet.  Right.  So you're sitting there, like you said, half the night you're eating it and half the night  you're killing.  Well, I still, I mean, to this day, I still get some nights where I've got my contingent 
[03:53:30]  of black t-shirt guys.  Uh-huh.  You know, guys that look like me with pot tits and facial hair.  Which is not the typical L.A. crowd, I wouldn't think.  No, but around the country.  Yeah, yeah.  And then there's the 60-year-old woman with her arms crossed going, is he going to talk  about his dick for 45 minutes?  And the guy in the black t-shirt?  When I'm 10 minutes in and that's all I've talked about.  The guy in the black t-shirt's like, yeah, he is!  Yes, he is.  What's it like in New York? 
[03:54:00]  Are the crowds?  It's been a little while, you know?  It depends on the club.  So you know how clubs are here.  Some of them are touristy or some of them are bridge and tunnel-y.  So I'm looking forward to seeing what happens.  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see.  I mean, I tweeted out.  I hope I get enough fans in there.  I think there are, too, because I just tweeted out randomly last night that you were going  to be on the show today.  And I just got a ton of people going, yes, yes!  Like, you've created, I guess.  And they're all from different little projects that you've done. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  Do you look for those little kind of culty projects to do where you're going to build  up a loyal audience?  No, man.  Or you just do what you like?  Yeah, it's just like everything I've done.  And it's just sort of, most of my jobs have been offered to me through friends.  I mean, I've auditioned over the years and gotten some things.  But, you know, stuff like Tom Goes to the Mayor is just through those guys saying, hey,  we want you to play Gibbons.  It's this little weird dude.  And do this voice.  And, you know, and a lot of other stuff. 
[03:55:00]  Even Just Shoot Me came from a writer in the room going, hey, this nerd character we're  writing, I know a guy who would be perfect for that.  You know?  And then I didn't even have to audition for that.  So, like...  Did you do a lot of auditioning?  I do.  Yeah.  And I still do.  I just...  I just...  I'm in Guys with Kids in a couple of weeks.  Oh, okay.  And that I actually had to go in.  That's weird.  Because you have, like you said, you have obviously a look.  Yeah.  It's a distinct thing. 
[03:55:30]  Right.  And so you'd think there'd be enough of that sort of, like, that's the guy we need.  Yeah.  I mean, there is that.  But sometimes they want you to jump through hoops.  And especially, maybe they want you to do something different.  It's like, oh, I've seen that guy do the thing where he does this and then...  So, let's get him to do something else.  Yeah.  That's all I did on Just Shoot Me was walk in like this and scream.  Do you get...  What's it like being on a sitcom like that?  Like, what's it like doing that character and knowing you're going to do the same thing 
[03:56:00]  every day and doing it for four years?  That was a lot of fun.  It does?  It stays fun?  Yeah.  It totally was.  I could have still been doing...  Well, maybe now.  Not now.  Maybe now...  I've been doing it for 30 years.  Yes.  Maybe now I'd be a little burned on it.  But I still had fun.  I mean, Spade was fun to hang around with.  He's just an idiot.  And he's fun to, you know, just laugh at crap all day long.  And then those...  They wrote crazy stories for me all the time.  Right.  I had a tarantula one week and then I have, you know, a vulture. 
[03:56:30]  I had a hold of a vulture in my hands while a vulture's flapping his arms like...  It was fucking horrifying.  That's what you look for.  Yeah.  But no.  No, but just they kept me doing crazy things.  And that's all that, you know, once I was on that show, I was like, oh, I'm that guy  now.  I'm the guy that comes in and just something ridiculous happens.  Which is good.  I mean, and then people remember you.  Well, you'd rather be that dude.  I remember being really young and hearing what a character actor was and going, that sounds 
[03:57:00]  way more appealing than being a regular actor.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, man.  Like you were never like, what?  He doesn't get to go to the Oscars?  No, but I never went, that's what I'm going to do.  But I remember being around 10 or 11 and hearing what a character actor was and going,  oh, those guys have the cool part.  You know, I always felt like guys on sitcoms that would walk in and just say, dumb shit,  you know, like even on Coach and, you know, like the big guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The big guy on Coach.  It was like, that guy is the sweet part. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Because he doesn't, he's not in every scene and he doesn't have to carry the bullshit  story.  Right.  He doesn't, like on Everybody Loves Raymond, Raymond has to be mad and then work things  out, but the brother gets to walk in.  Right, yeah, just gets to come in and lighten everything up.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are the parts.  Like the big doofy, what's his name in Night Court?  Yeah, exactly.  Bull.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bull very rarely carried a story.  He didn't have that kind of pressure put on him.  No, no, no. 
[03:58:00]  And thank God for that too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, so are you like a horror movie snob now?  Like we, do you still enjoy them or do you have an era that you're like, this is where  we peaked?  Uh, I'm both.  I mean, I still check out new movies, but then I, you know, I don't think anybody's ever  going to beat, uh, yeah, I had to make sure I was wearing John Carpenter, but yeah, I  mean, I don't think anybody's ever going to beat Halloween or The Thing.  Right.  You know.  And what do you think of the remakes? 
[03:58:30]  Like I said.  Yeah, yeah, you don't think that.  Uh, I liked Halloween.  I liked what Rob, uh, did of, uh, kind of setting up Michael Myers and making him more of like  a serial killer, but it's not what he was in the original movie.  Right.  You know, it's sort of a separate thing.  I enjoy it separately.  The Thing remake, I didn't love so much because it seemed like way too much CGI and, and, uh,  you know.  I think a lot of people didn't like The Thing remake too much.  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't a big one. 
[03:59:00]  Um, you're a married guy, right?  Yes.  How did you, before you, how long have you been married for?  Eight years.  Oh, okay.  So, did you ever, did you, do you have now like, you know, groupies or like nerd girls  coming up to you and like, are you kind of a weirdo fantasy guy?  Occasionally.  Yeah, I do.  There, there are, there are girls that would love to go home with me occasionally.  I get that every once in a while.  Yeah.  And it's a type.  Yeah.  I mean, I, but there are girls that weren't around. 
[03:59:30]  Like when I was single, because my wife and I had been married for eight years, but we've  been together 15 and there's like a type now.  So she's been there kind of forever almost.  Yeah, there's a type that didn't really exist, you know, like the suicide girl.  Right.  That wasn't a thing 15, 20 years ago.  Uh, you know, so now I get these girls covered in tattoos and with like, uh, black, black glasses  and shit and, and dyed black hair and it's like, oh, you're so hot, but where were you  fucking in the night?  Just yelling in their faces.  What, where were you?  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:00:00]  It would have been so easy.  Yeah.  Is it so, but now you have to be like, well, I'm married, I have a kid.  Well, they know it now.  You know, I, I talk so much about it on stage.  I even do a thing right now where if I were to cheat, you know, but it's really clear that  I'm not gonna, you know, is that for yourself, is that to make it so that it's very, it's  a lot easier for you not to cheat?  No.  Like you set this up, so don't, just leave me alone.  No, it came from an organic place.  It came from, um, my wife being afraid of me cheating.  And I just think that's ridiculous because the whole bit is about how gross I am and, 
[04:00:30]  and, you know, how, um, taking off my shirt, you know, the girl would be like, you know,  and I'd be like, it gets worse.  And then I'd take off my pants.  Uh-huh.  It's like, cause it's just like, uh, with my wife, the degradation has been gradual.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like she's been with me for 15 years.  She's learned to accept certain things.  Not that I was, not that I was a piece of ass 15 years ago.  She had the young Brian Bosane.  Right.  But, but now it's like, I, I, uh, you know, I say in the act, it's, it's like showing, 
[04:01:00]  uh, your shitty car or having somebody get in your shitty car for the first time.  Uh-huh.  Or there's too many explanations and apologies.  You're like, oh, that hasn't worked in years.  Yeah.  You gotta throw your shoulder into that.  They didn't grow with it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, uh, that's funny.  You're gonna be at Caroline's, uh, this weekend.  It's Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, uh, carolines.com.  It's on 49th and 50th.  Uh, it's right there on Broadway. 
[04:01:30]  Do you, uh, the tourists, do they still, I would assume that even with tourists, they  would recognize you from the shows.  No?  Yeah, I do well.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, don't get me wrong.  I mean, I do well in front of anybody, but I have more fun when it's, when there's more  of my people in there, and I'll loosen up, you know, and, and, uh, it's just, you can  say things that you don't have to worry about, you know?  I mean, it's not just references, but regular people, you know, like, even in San Francisco 
[04:02:00]  or a place like that, where you think that they, they've heard everything, there's certain  topics where you just even start to go on a topic, you know?  Yeah.  And they're like, oh no.  What about, you know, you just get groaners on the end, but when they're your crowd, no  one groans.  Of course, yeah, because they appreciate what they're saying.  The one thing I do get, though, when it's all my crowd, is, um, I'll get some of these  girls that I'm talking about, like the suicide girls, that defend me when I'm making fun of 
[04:02:30]  myself.  Like, I'll be doing self-deprecating bits, like, I'm a disgusting fucking pig, and they'll  go, no!  And it's like, shut up!  That's all this is about.  You're worse than a heckler.  I'm doing 20 minutes now, I'm just about to talk about how much I hate myself.  And the last thing you need is the guys being like, what?  That chick loves him, what's he talking about?  This isn't funny at all.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, what about when there's somebody that you love watching you?  Like, you know, you're an obsessive guy, kind of like me, and you have these people  that you have this massive fandom for, who obviously come to you and be like, oh, I like 
[04:03:00]  what you do.  Can you, do you, does it change your vibe when you're doing a show and somebody like that,  like Scott Ian or somebody, you know, when you first met him, before you became closer  with him, is, is sitting in the audience?  No, it's weird.  You just try not to think about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because like, anytime anybody who's got any sort of fame at all goes, oh yeah, I was  listening to your show the other day.  I go, what?  And like, the next day, it's just completely in my head, like this sucks, this sucks, I  can't believe he's listening to it right now. 
[04:03:30]  No, I haven't let that bother me.  I've had, you know, over the years, a lot of band guys, like when I'm in Tampa, that's  where all the death metal bands are, so that's been a little weird to like go, you know, Cannibal  Corpse is here?  Like, I've even said that on stage, like, you guys, you may not care, but this is fucking  awesome.  Cannibal Corpse is here.  And they're just laughing.  Three of them.  And being jolly.  Yeah, yeah.  Their name's Cannibal Corpse.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Well, listen, we got to go.  We got to make room for Ron and Fez. 
[04:04:00]  Definitely check out Brian Posehn.  What's your Twitter?  The Brian Posehn?  Yes.  And it's P-O-S-E-H-N.  I like also that not only did you never change your material, but you didn't develop one of  those show business names.  Like, you have a very hard to pronounce name on first site.  You like that.  Yeah, I've gotten used to it.  Well, check them out at Caroline's all weekend.  Caroline's.com for tickets.  Thank you for joining us.  Yeah, thanks, man.  And we'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.
