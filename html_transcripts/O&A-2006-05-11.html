<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, referring to themselves with offensive terms like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts." They introduced their crew with similarly insulting nicknames.  A major focus was a feud with Howard Stern, sparked by an AP article suggesting their return to terrestrial radio was a failure. Opie and Anthony vehemently denied this, citing their strong XM ratings, including a period as a premium channel. They accused Stern of lying about terrestrial radio offers and criticized a Forbes article they felt was biased in Stern's favor.  They also heavily criticized Chris Daughtry's elimination from *American Idol*, calling the show rigged.  The show included listener calls, discussion of the Russian model falling from a motorhome, and announcements of upcoming gigs for Norton and Anthony's brother.

The broadcast continued with a studio segment featuring a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader and stripper ("Taddy" and "Portia"), prompting numerous sexually explicit jokes. Comedian Rich Voss was a guest, contributing to the conversation, which largely centered on the killing of a large black bear in New Jersey after a two-day chase.  The hosts and callers made humorous and insensitive comments about the situation, mocking animal rights activists and comparing the media coverage to the Iraq War.  The show also discussed the firing of a radio DJ, "Star," played audio clips from news reports about the bear and "Star," and included listener calls on topics ranging from baseball to "To Catch a Predator."  Voss shared anecdotes from his stand-up routine, including one performed live at a Starbucks during the broadcast.

A significant portion dealt with "Star's" firing from Clear Channel for making offensive on-air threats. Opie and Anthony debated the justification, contrasting "Star's" comments with their own history of controversial content, which they framed as dark humor. They played audio from a Dateline NBC segment on an internet predator who brought his son to a meeting.  Voss remained a guest, sharing personal anecdotes, and later participating in a live walk from the studio to XM radio,  where they interacted with pedestrians. They played a country music parody of Van Halen's "Jump." A segment called "Radio 2 Recovery," hosted by Voss, focused on addiction.  The show included a live walk, teasing news stories to the listeners in their walk to XM, further casual conversations with the crew, and mentions of smoothies and an awkward encounter with a CBS executive.

The show then delved into a discussion about a woman on Paltalk shaving her pubic hair, leading to crude comments and encouragement for her to remove her top.  This transitioned into "The Daily Dump Report," revealing censored listener calls involving child molestation and sexually suggestive jokes.  Listener calls continued, some sharing personal anecdotes about Voss,  and others seeking advice on finding prostitutes. The firing of "Star" was re-discussed, playing clips of his offensive racial slurs and threats.  The hosts speculated on his behavior,  the lack of a "dump button,"  and the culture of Hot 97. Callers offered various perspectives, some condemning "Star's" actions, others analyzing the reasons behind them. The hosts also discussed their own censorship experiences and relationship with CBS. A former Hot 97 employee called in, offering insight into the station's environment. The segment ended with further discussion of "Star's" firing and the lack of a dump button.

The next segment focused on the fallout from Todd Lynn's "R. Kelly comment," prompting speculation about the pressures on radio hosts to generate ratings.  The conversation touched upon FCC violations across different radio demographics,  and a caller suggested settling disputes with an octagon fight.  Graphic audio clips detailing a violent confrontation between "Star" and a station executive, including racial slurs and sexual assault accusations, were played.  The hosts played impersonations, using further offensive language.  A caller called Jimmy a hypocrite.  Celebrity voicemails from Freddy Rodriguez, Dane Cook, Henry Rollins, Anna Faris, Frank Vincent, and Kevin Smith were played, along with a remixed song.  Listener calls followed, including Goodfellas trivia, discussions about Chris Daughtry's *American Idol* departure, a song by "Brother Joe," and a Fox News segment on Disneyland ("Predatorland").  A discussion about Elo's pink tie and an XM pin resembling a Nazi pin occurred, leading to a debate on the hosts' motivation for continuing on the show despite expressing dissatisfaction with their employer ("free radio").  An audio segment from Alan Sniffen of the New York Radio Message Board on the show's evolution concluded the segment.

The final excerpt revolved around the show's evolution, comparing their earlier, more controversial style to their current approach on terrestrial radio. They referenced a parody of news broadcasts with "hens" clucking and their past focus on TNA wrestling.  The hosts discussed the risks of pushing boundaries on over-the-air radio and cited past controversies. A caller, Chris, described his job driving a street sweeper.  The discussion focused on the perception that their biggest enemy was themselves, speculating about the reactions of radio management figures, including Julie Kahn and Howard Stern.  Upcoming appearances were mentioned.  Multiple phone calls, including one from someone seemingly affiliated with Citadel, interrupted.  The conversation became increasingly rambling and included sexually suggestive and crude humor.  The "E-Rock Radio" segment featured a caller roleplaying a conversation with a Tourette's Syndrome-afflicted individual calling a brothel.  The show ended abruptly with insults and a tease of a break that may or may not have returned, with Billy Burr mentioned as the next day's guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people. You know, I move on, and, you know, I just wish you well. 
[00:00:30]  I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well.  Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No! Shut up!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow. We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts. Stupid.  We stink. We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We care like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boob that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron? 
[00:01:30]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  Let's get the show on the road.  Get it on the road.  I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[00:02:00]  How quick were you?  We have a comment from Star?  You're a joke!  You're fired!  Fire!  Don't go for that old guy. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  You're not suspended.  You're not on temporary leave.  You're fired.  Good God, I'm a linda.  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony program.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We are your favorite failures.  We're failing so badly that we're just talking to more and more people every single day.  That's what failures get to do in radio.  Isn't that the goal in radio? 
[00:03:00]  Is to start out in radio and then as you go along, talk to more and more people.  Get more listeners.  Well, I guess we're failures then.  Stupid Howard Stern.  We'll get into the AP story in a little bit here.  But basically, Howard's saying our move back to terrestrial radio proves that we failed on satellite radio.  That's how he's spinning it.  I want the AP people, the AP associated poopy is what I say. 
[00:03:30]  I want them on the phone for a rebuttal because I'm not going to sit here and have that jackass call us failures.  In his little story.  How is that a failure?  And it's nice of the AP to come to the people that actually the story is based around and get their side of the story. 
[00:04:00]  You want a story about how that jackass just lies?  Liar.  He's a liar.  I googled Opie and Anthony and there's hundreds of articles saying that we failed on satellite radio, according to Howard Stern.  Unbelievable.  And I guess yesterday he had to beg to get someone from the AP on his show because he's not talking to that many people.  Yeah, he used to just get on his own show when he had listeners and that was enough. 
[00:04:30]  Not anymore.  Now he's got to go on, you know, Booker's show.  For somebody that bashes terrestrial radio so much, he spends a lot of time on it.  Because he's got to get his message out there still.  Yeah, because no one's listening.  See, we're still talking to more of Howard's listeners than he is.  Yep.  That's just a plain fact.  It's the way it is.  But in the article it says how our move back to terrestrial radio proves that we're failures and that we failed on satellite radio.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Our critics are just a bunch of douches. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Come up with something that might be logical.  It all started when we got back to radio.  We went on XM, XM satellite radio, and they were very scared of us because of what we did.  And so what they did was they had us as a premium channel on the XM platform.  And we were pissed about that because the idea stunk.  From day one we hated it, but we had no choice back then.  It's like you had to pay extra money to hear our show. 
[00:05:30]  And we were coming off two years of not being on the air at all.  So we weren't able to, you know, promote the fact that we were going there or anything.  So we go there and they go, oh, by the way, we're putting you on this platform that you have to pay extra and ask for.  You know, meanwhile, especially at the time when we first came on board, satellite radio isn't something that everybody is familiar with or knew, you know, how it worked or to sign up was enough for people.  And then they had to go that extra step and go, oh, and I want this, you know, I want Opie and Anthony, so I want to pay extra. 
[00:06:00]  It was just a disaster in the beginning.  But with that, we still got a lot of people to sign up to hear our show on the premium channel on XM in the beginning.  And we fought every day to get off of that premium.  Every day we had arguments with them that we wanted off.  Well, our savior was Eric Logan.  He joined the company and said, what are you guys doing?  You guys aren't radio people if you're keeping Opie and Anthony on a premium channel.  So he was able to get us off the premium channel. 
[00:06:30]  Six months.  It was six months later.  Six months later, we got off the premium channel.  And then all the critics out there and people that hate us go, well, see, that proves they're just failing on satellite radio.  Yeah, no matter what we do, it's a proof of our fail.  See, that proves they're failing, and now they have to open it up to the entire platform so they can get more listeners.  But if we were failing at that point, why wouldn't you just fire us?  Yeah, just get rid of us.  We try to be honest on this program.  Our deal with XM, it's a deal that they could fire us after every year. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  So if we're six months into it.  Yeah, it was.  It was.  Well, we'll get into that, too.  If we're six months into it, all right, take the hit.  We suck so bad.  We're failures.  Just get rid of us.  Pay us for a few months.  Maybe they wouldn't even have to.  I don't even know.  I'd have to look at the contract.  Yeah.  Right?  So we go on the regular platform of XM, but everyone says we're failures.  Yeah, that proved that we failed because we are now open up to the entire audience on XM. 
[00:07:30]  And, you know, we chuckled about that one.  And then as time goes by, we're getting more and more successful out of – how many channels does XM have?  I don't know.  150 music channels.  150 music channels.  And then a bunch of crap.  And we're always within the top ten.  We're always within the top ten channels as far as popularity goes and listenership.  And the ones that get, you know, number one are things like Fox News because people tune in in the morning. 
[00:08:00]  It's like here in New York.  Winds always does well because of the news station.  There's a few stations on satellite that just cume ridiculous.  You're right.  Like the top 20 songs and all that.  But, see, there's other numbers that are even more impressive.  We're like one of the most listened to morning shows on the entire platform.  So then that goes on for eight, nine months.  Now we're on the regular XM, right?  And then they make a deal with DirecTV.  Yeah.  And DirecTV, you know, has all those music channels, right? 
[00:08:30]  But they were able to finagle a deal where they threw us on there as well.  Music channels and the Opie and Anthony show basically, right?  The critics, again, this proves that they're failing.  They're failing miserably.  They're failing miserably and they don't have enough people listening on the regular XM platform.  So now they're opening them up to all the DirecTV listeners or viewers or whatever you want to say.  How do you spin that into failure?  Oh, my God.  And then DirecTV decides they are just going with music. 
[00:09:00]  Right, and they want to get rid of us.  And they're getting rid of all the talk, the Major League Baseball, us, and anything else that was talk and just sticking with XM's music channels.  Well, the backlash from our listeners and our pests was so great that after a week, the owner of the company of DirecTV said,  All right, please stop.  We're putting them back on.  He had had it.  He said the response was deafening. 
[00:09:30]  Deafening?  Yeah.  And who is this Ramon?  We haven't even described the ONA pest thing to the people that haven't heard us in a while or the people that are hearing us for the first time.  One of these days we'll get really into it.  But right now they're attacking Forbes.  They've got all these little attacks going on.  They're attacking Howard again today, calling him a liar.  They've got all these little missions going on.  It's just wonderful.  So then, yeah, we get back on DirecTV, right?  And then we make this huge freaking deal, the deal that this is the deal you're supposed to make. 
[00:10:00]  This is the deal of the new radio medium.  This is, you've heard about terrestrial radio and satellite for quite a while now, butting heads and what's going to become of radio because of satellite.  Satellite's getting more listeners, all this going back and forth and back and forth.  And look at what the Opie and Anthony show does.  Gets on both.  Gets on both.  Brings the mediums together and gets on both platforms, terrestrial and satellite, to entertain a bigger audience than we've ever had. 
[00:10:30]  And, again, what are we for doing that?  Failures.  Failures.  We are the most successful failures I've ever seen.  God, I just hope we continue to fail.  Please keep failing.  If we continue to fail like this, I think we're going to be talking to the entire world soon.  Unbelievable how they try to twist it and spin it.  But it's only a few. 
[00:11:00]  There was some just douche from Forbes magazine yesterday that wrote a little piece about the situation.  And just, like, lambasted us and kissed Howard's ass.  Like, I didn't see his reasoning for it, the purpose for it.  And he, like, it was a totally slanted article from Forbes. 
[00:11:30]  Forbes.  Forbes, how do you get a guy like that work in there that just cannot do a balanced story?  So then Howard has to put out his AP thing.  Because, well, as we said, you know, Mel obviously got to him and said, you know, we've had those conversations with Mel where he sits you down and gives you the question.  Uh, how is it good for my stockholders to have my number one morning show and my number one afternoon show fighting with each other?  Uh, I don't know. 
[00:12:00]  I don't know, Mel.  So, you know, Howard was dragged in and said, how does it help the stockholders of Sirius for you to be spreading rumors that you might be giving away your show for free?  And Howard had to go on the air and say that he wasn't going to terrestrial radio.  He would have loved to have sat back.  And milked that.  And milked the press and the publicity because, believe me, he wants all he can get these days. 
[00:12:30]  He's not getting the headlines like he used to.  Every day he was in the paper about a guest that was on his show and something they said or something he said or, oh, he's being crucified again.  Hoo-hoo.  Uh, it just isn't happening anymore.  And I find it odd that now we got to have him piggybacked on our goddamn news stories.  Man, it's freaking annoying.  All right.  How would we understand now?  It is annoying.  It's freaking annoying.  Where is the AP story, by the way?  It's just that he just completely lied. 
[00:13:00]  And Mel Karmazin was like, what are you doing?  The stock is, you know, is not doing well whatsoever.  And this isn't going to help the stock.  So you get on the air and you make it perfectly clear you're not going back to terrestrial radio.  Right.  And you could tell by the statement that he was told that because there are certain, like, key words and phrases that are only put out by publicists and damage control people.  And again, hey, name the companies. 
[00:13:30]  Name the companies that are courting you.  Yeah, we challenge Howard to name the companies.  What do you got to lose?  What do you got to lose?  You've now announced you're not going back to terrestrial radio.  Tell us about the deals you had.  You didn't have a...  You almost did it.  You almost...  You didn't have a deal.  Everyone knows you didn't have a deal.  I got an email in front of me from someone that is way in the know, way in the know.  Ben Sparks?  All I can say is he's an expert on the media.  Okay? 
[00:14:00]  Because we do have our spies and our pests everywhere.  Yep.  And just part of the email, he goes, Howard is an out-and-out liar.  You know, because everyone's trying to figure out what radio company, you know, offered you this deal.  He said he got three major offers.  Three major offers.  Here's what it went from, too.  It went from him on the air just saying, oh, wouldn't it be great if I went back to regular radio and kicked their ass?  That's what he said.  That was the initial statement that started this whole thing. 
[00:14:30]  It wasn't, I have a deal.  It wasn't, I'm going back to radio.  He was speculating how fun it would be for him to come back and kick our ass in morning drive.  And then somehow that got to, there's an offer for him to do this.  And then it spread to three offers to do this.  It just shows you how the lie escalated.  So call the AP.  This is what we got today.  Howard, we challenge you.  Yeah.  Name the companies that were going to bring you back to terrestrial radio.  Name one. 
[00:15:00]  Name one of the three.  Name one, you liar.  So this person in the know that really works close with the media and radio in general wrote me this email last night.  Howard is an out-and-out liar.  And then he lists all the companies, okay?  Or a bunch of the big ones because, you know, there's others.  Clear Channel threw him off the air.  Yeah.  Threw him off the air.  He had major beef.  Before his contract was even over. 
[00:15:30]  He had major beef with Clear Channel.  Yeah.  Threw him off the air.  CBS, you know, the company we're now working for again.  Sorry.  They're suing him.  Spot's already full, too.  They're suing him.  Cumulus, another radio company, refused to air him ever.  Yep.  Cox Radio would never air him.  Mm-hmm.  Beasley threw him off.  Citadel threw him off.  And Farid, who runs Citadel, not a big fan of the man. 
[00:16:00]  Not at all.  I believe he said something about his seed, I think.  We are just so sick of his lies, his hypocrisy.  Mm-hmm.  The reality is he doesn't give a crap about his listeners.  We got some of his listeners listening right now.  Howard doesn't give a crap about you.  The reality is this was the deal to make in radio.  Mm-hmm.  We knew it.  We tried to do this 18 months ago.  No one was ready to play at that point.  We understand.  We had to rebuild our name in the business and get our thing going again. 
[00:16:30]  This was the deal to make.  Howard knew it all along, but he's a greedy F, and he went for the money.  Yeah.  And now it's killing him.  Now it's killing him that he's stuck over there with a huge paycheck, but he's not talking to anybody.  He's got a great paycheck, but yeah, in order for him to address people and to get his point across,  he's got to call press conferences where he used to just say it on his show and the press picked up on it.  Now if he says it on his show, no one cares because no one hears it. 
[00:17:00]  It's just a fact.  And people are just spewing Howie math all over the place about numbers.  One guy said that Howard had a half a million – or Sirius had a half a million subscribers before Howard went on the air,  and Howard brought in three and a half million subscribers.  And I've heard him say that.  That is a blatant lie.  More lies.  Just a huge lie through all kinds of real surveys and polling, Arbitron, subnumbers, averages that both companies have done over the years 
[00:17:30]  where you can kind of project how many subscribers the company is going to get based on what they've done in the past.  You know how many you're bringing on board in any given quarter of the year. 
[00:18:00]  And he did not bring in three and a half million people.  They're speculating he may have cracked a million people.  That's pretty much it.  They're looking at about anywhere between five and eight percent of his old audience came along with him.  That's it.  That's it.  Those are the facts.  When he blurts out numbers on the air, he's trying to over-inflate what he's got going on over there. 
[00:18:30]  It didn't happen.  There he is on Fox 5.  There you go.  I'm not going back to terrestrial radio.  I would throw up if I had to go back and have people listen to me.  That's right, Owen.  I'd throw up in my golden toilet bowl, Robin.  My toilet made of gold.  Unbelievable.  And the stupid media just goes with it.  Oh, they ran with it like the sheep they are. 
[00:19:00]  You dopes in the media.  All you had to do was just a little bit of research,  and you would have found out that he was just lying to get some headlines.  So this email continues, all right, that I got last night.  It says I could go on and on.  He's trying to draw attention to himself while you guys sit in his old studio attacking him in his old time slot.  He can't take it.  No radio company approached him.  Trust me on that.  He has it reversed.  Your return to terrestrial radio is a sign of failure of him to deliver to a bigger audience. 
[00:19:30]  Excuse me.  Sorry.  And it just goes on and on.  It is killing him.  There you go.  Well, I want AP.  I want to talk to the Associated Press today and set the record straight.  How can they print Howard saying we're failures?  And not even talk to us.  We're talking to more people than he is.  Oh, we'll give you some great sound bites.  We got more subs on XM than they got over at Sirius. 
[00:20:00]  By the way, I would love to go to the phones, but, you know, someone's got to check these phones every day before we get in here.  We don't have time to screw around and figure out what's wrong with the phones live on the show.  We only do two hours and 50 minutes over here.  So, the AP article, no censorship, no fines, no FCC.  It's no wonder Howard Stern announced that there's no way he would abandon satellite radio for a return to traditional broadcasting.  I'm very flattered terrestrial radio can't let go of me, Stern said Wednesday on his morning radio show. 
[00:20:30]  They can and they did.  But I would throw up if I had to go back.  I'm never going back.  What I love is they're finally calling him the self-proclaimed king of all media.  What is he the king of, really, at this point?  The king of a few hundred thousand listeners.  The self-proclaimed king of all media said three companies had made overtures through his agent for a terrestrial deal, but there was no interest from his end.  He did not name the companies.  Once again, we say name the companies, Howard. 
[00:21:00]  Name them.  Name them.  Go ahead.  Because just about everyone in the industry at this point knows that you're lying.  So, prove us wrong.  Prove us wrong.  I'll go on the air tomorrow and go, all right, I was wrong.  I'm an idiot.  Although radio industry expert Tom Taylor said it was no surprise that Stern would draw such attention.  I've never been happier, Stern said.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Stern made his comments during an on-air interview Wednesday with the AP that he begged to talk to.  He insisted on speaking with the AP about the reports that he might consider a simulcasting deal where he split time between series and a traditional outlet. 
[00:21:30]  Stern competitors Greg Opie Hughes and Anthony Cumia recently made such an agreement with CBS Radio.  Stern worked for CBS before making his move to satellite in January.  On a show Wednesday, Stern said that Opie and Anthony's return to traditional radio signified their failure on satellite.  And he reiterated his intent to continue his program exclusively on satellite.  Yeah, because you were told to, jackass.  You were told to. 
[00:22:00]  Opie and Anthony on their morning show, of course, this didn't make the print version in the papers today.  Opie and Anthony on their morning show continued their long-running feud with Stern by questioning his claims.  He's lying through his teeth, said Hughes, about any offers for Stern to come back on terrestrial radio.  There you go.  So you're listening to two big, big failures.  Yep.  We just continue to fail.  Failure radio.  We continue to fail up.  Isn't that great?  If I was failing this bad in high school, I would be at an Ivy League college.  I would have been at an Ivy League college instead of going to some dopey SUNY school. 
[00:22:30]  Let's say hi.  Derek in Boston, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  I'm one of the cheap pricks who haven't heard you guys in for like four years over here at BCN.  Yeah.  Don't get me wrong.  I love you guys.  It's awesome having you back, and I'm with you on a lot of this.  You know, Mr. Self-Right just definitely has his panties in a bunch.  Yeah.  But you guys got to know that if he did come back, he would immediately spike to number one.  I mean, you're not disputing that, right? 
[00:23:00]  No, he wouldn't.  No, I don't think you're right there, Derek.  Perhaps in 1992, 93, 94, that would happen.  It's not that time anymore.  The guy lost.  I don't know.  I think you guys possibly might be a little naive.  I mean, you're spot on being.  No, I think you're being naive, dude.  I think you're being naive.  The guy has lost any passion that he used to have to do radio.  It's gone. 
[00:23:30]  The guy, I understand what you mean.  Back in the old days, forget about it.  The guy could have come back to.  If he came back, he might not last.  You know what I mean?  But as soon as he came back, however long it happened.  Derek, then I say bring it on.  He had, Derek, I say bring it on.  He had three, quote, offers from companies to come back.  So I say bring it on.  We're not scared of the guy.  There's a way to do both, satellite and terrestrial.  He's a complete ass.  He's a liar.  He's a hypocrite.  Doesn't give a crap about his listeners.  Never did. 
[00:24:00]  And he's very greedy.  And it's going to cost him now.  And I'm saying I'm with you guys.  All right, Derek.  Thank you.  You're, you know.  Please.  He's with us, but we'd get destroyed.  A couple more phone calls, and we've got to go to break.  Andrea in New York City.  Andrea.  Hey, guys.  I think you're incredibly brave for what you've all done.  And I love your show.  I really do great.  We're not brave.  We see how weak he really is.  I come in in my suit of armor every day.  I'm a gentleman.  We were lucky to work for the same company as him for four years, and we were able to see 
[00:24:30]  how weak he really is and what kind of a person he is.  He's a jerk.  Because I worked with him.  I did a show for him.  I did the crack for review.  And he didn't even pay us for anything.  And he, we were in the trade magazines, and they made a big, huge deal about us.  Yeah.  But, like, he dropped us like flies.  Although the people that work underneath him, they're such fiends for Howard.  They're psycho.  They're like drones.  It's like a cult.  They're really, really bad.  Oh, yeah.  You know, you got your job over there is to just kiss his ass constantly. 
[00:25:00]  We worked for the same company.  So, believe me, we know the whole deal.  It's not like we're just, we worked for some competing company, and we have this perception  of the guy.  We know what this guy is all about.  There you go.  Let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey, make it fast, because we got to take a break.  No problem.  I got two questions for Howby, because I know he's listening.  One, if O&A has such failures on satellite, why are they still on the platform, much less 
[00:25:30]  with an extra hour plus a day?  And two, why are you still talking about them?  Much an out, boys.  Love you.  Yeah, he certainly does mention us a lot.  He sure does, Gary.  Didn't used to do that.  Long Island, Gary.  What's up?  Yo, man, he's just pissed because you guys beat him at both steps.  You made it to satellite well before he ever did.  But then when he followed you to that, then you go and pull this out of that.  Right.  Howard's just better, man.  That's all.  We just keep failing up.  It's very strange.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's our response, because, you know, Howard in an AP article saying that we failed 
[00:26:00]  on satellite, and that's why we had to go back to terrestrial radio.  Failures.  Yeah.  That's great.  So we just point out once again that he's a freaking liar.  Name the companies, Howard.  That's my challenge.  Just name them.  Just name them.  We know the ones they're not.  Name them.  We named them, and that doesn't leave many.  Name them.  And we'll go first.  Fareed from Citadel, he's trying to get us on in Providence.  There you go.  We gave a little.  Now you tell us what company is trying to get you on terrestrial radio. 
[00:26:30]  Name them.  We know it ain't Citadel.  Name them.  What is it?  Just name them.  Or did you have to lie to get your name in the paper again?  Because you're feeling a little desperation over there.  So you're coming up with ways every day to keep your face and your name in the press.  That's what it really is, isn't it, Howard?  Isn't it?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:27:00]  We don't even have to give out the number.  But if you want to write it down for a future phone call, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We got a really busy show today.  Star got fired.  Another shock jock self-destruct.  We'll get into that.  Also, the American Idol thing.  Oh, my God.  We'll get into that right after the break.  Thanks.  The New Jersey Bear that we were discussing and goofing on yesterday.  Yes, we reported it first.  We report the news before it happens. 
[00:27:30]  We should play the audio from yesterday because it was pretty accurate.  And good old David Lee Roth.  Yes.  He just won't go away.  I hold in my hand, strumming with the devil.  The southern side of Van Halen.  Strumming.  Is it called strumming with the devil?  A tribute featuring David Lee Roth.  Wait till you hear the country version of Jump.  All right.  It's all on the way on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  Oh, my God.  Do we still have those tool tickets?  We do, right?  Oh, God.  That's just been a disaster.  Our first giveaway after coming back to Terrestrial Radio.  Couldn't get just an easy contest together.  Don't call for the tool tickets right now.  We got business right now.  Unless you're a semi-retarded Indian girl. 
[00:28:30]  We'd love to give them to you.  Oh, God.  Ooh.  She slowed down the program a little bit yesterday, huh?  No more of her.  Let's say hi to Doug in White Plains.  Doug, what's going on today?  Hey, ONA.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Listen, I got to watch this ONA virus.  Well...  Ah, yes.  It's something to do with the show.  We noticed it years ago.  We didn't just come up with it and, you know, make people think that it's something that happens.  It happened, and we had to come up with a name for it.  It's, uh... 
[00:29:00]  You know what a virus does to you?  It kind of gets in there.  Somebody has the virus.  They get near you.  And all of a sudden, uh...  You get it.  And you spread it to other people.  That's how this show works for some reason.  Uh...  You get it.  And then there's really nothing you can do about it.  It starts with, like, a symptom.  Yeah.  Eh, Opie and Anthony, they're all right.  Eh, they're funny sometimes, but they bitch about Howard too much.  So I don't know.  I don't know if I want to listen to them.  Eh, my friend likes them, but, yeah, it's on in the car when we drive to work, so... 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And I heard a couple of things made me laugh, but for the most part, they're boring.  Right.  All they do is bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.  Yeah, bah, bah.  But then there's something about it, and you listen again, and all of a sudden the symptoms  just get out of control, and you're fully infected, and you're like...  It was just a stuffy nose, maybe, and a scratchy throat at first.  And you don't even know why you're listening, because they're still unprepared.  Obviously, they're winging it every morning.  Yeah.  But, you know, they did something this morning.  Let me tell you about what they did. 
[00:30:00]  And then you're telling your friends a little.  Right.  And then, I don't know, in time, you're just walking around the house with a cup of chicken  broth and a tattered robe, waiting for a friend to come over and take care of your little dog,  because you're just too weak.  And it's a very interactive show, so our listeners, they're very aggressive, very active, and they  like to tell other people about the program, especially when we're doing good.  Yeah.  And so the virus just kind of spreads. 
[00:30:30]  Just kind of spreads.  So it spreads out and takes people over.  That's right.  So it's the O&A virus.  To answer your question, this show, it's AIDS with a laugh track.  Yeah.  It works the same way AIDS does.  So, but that's it, you know, you don't even know why you're listening right now.  I see it.  We understand.  I understand that.  We're still trying to figure this out.  But eventually, you're going to like the program, most of you.  And then you're going to eventually, I know you're shaking your head, but trust me, eventually 
[00:31:00]  you're going to like the program, and you're going to be telling others about this program.  It's just how it works.  We don't understand it ourselves.  So that's why the virus and spread the virus, okay?  All right.  Moving on.  Who didn't see American Idol last night?  Oh, that rigged show?  That show has lost all credibility in my eyes.  It is a joke.  And I've said this a few weeks back that I was convinced that they're not taking the voting 
[00:31:30]  by the public seriously.  If they are, then America is just filled with a bunch of dummies.  I don't know who's voting, how they're doing the accounting of the voting.  Is there anybody that, like an independent, outside, regulatory, whatever, that checks  where this voting, where these numbers are coming from?  Because that just didn't make sense last night.  The guy who was supposed to win the whole thing. 
[00:32:00]  Should we just play the clip?  Because it is very dramatic.  Dramatic.  Well, the judges don't, I don't really watch the show.  The judges don't vote.  Like, the three judges aren't the ones that boot you at this point, right?  No, but the judges kind of help the public a lot.  What kind of influence could dope...  Paul Abdul.  Paul Abdul have over people.  I'm talking more like Simon.  Simon tells it like it is.  Well, Simon, yeah, he tells it like it is.  So you're influenced by that.  At least it's some type of actual criticism. 
[00:32:30]  But they've thrown him into a corner where you're just supposed to hate him  so you don't really listen to what he has to say when he speaks the truth on that program.  You know, Ryan Seacrest every week has to challenge Simon for being too mean.  Shut up.  That Ryan, I like him, man.  That kid's got pizzazz.  Ryan Seacrest is awful.  I don't know.  He's a good dresser.  You're lying.  I like him a lot.  He's got a good smile.  You just can't turn him off when he's on.  You're lying. 
[00:33:00]  Shut up.  Well, here's the dramatic audio from last night, and then we'll get into it for a couple  of minutes here, okay?  Who do I think should go based on last night?  Sure.  Catherine.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of people predicted both of you could be in our finale.  A lot of people predicted, Chris, that you could be the next American Idol.  Chris, you are going home tonight. 
[00:33:30]  The journey ends.  America, you have spoken, and Chris is off the show tonight.  What he should have said right there, America, you stink.  Yeah.  There was the dramatic announcement from Ryan Seacrest last night.  I don't watch the show, but I've heard the audio of them singing, and the fact that that  bitch that sang Hound Dog is still on the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just the worst.  She stunk that joint up two nights ago, and then America voted her over Chris, who has 
[00:34:00]  a great voice.  People have been saying since day one.  He's a professional.  That Chris Daughtry was going to win the whole thing.  Yeah.  He was so much better than everybody else.  It wasn't even a competition anymore.  And I'm starting to think, you know, the American Idol people behind the scenes realized that  and thought, you know, let's pull a wrestling move here.  Let's have a dramatic storyline that everybody, including us, we're doing it. 
[00:34:30]  Everybody will be talking about how Chris Daughtry got kicked off American Idol.  And it'll add to the ratings of the dumb program, even though they don't really need any more  ratings.  Well, do they need a woman, do you think?  They always seem to have it kind of balanced at the end.  Do you think they just needed a broad to stay on?  No.  A woman won, like, the past two times.  Jimmy, Chris Daughtry made the show almost boring.  He was that much better than everybody else.  Yeah.  You just knew he was going to win.  You just knew he was going to win the whole thing.  So for this to happen, it's like, what are you doing behind the scenes, American Idol?  What's going on there? 
[00:35:00]  Here's what they're doing.  Again, it's a lot better to have two winners because they make twice as much money, and  so they throw him off.  He's still going to have a huge career for himself.  The guy's going to do very well.  He's going to make records.  They're going to sell.  And they're going to have a winner of American Idol that will also sell records just on the  fact that they won the show.  Sort of like what happened with Clay Aiken.  You know, Clay Aiken was second place.  He didn't win.  Oh, I thought you meant that Chris Daughtry was going to get screen capped in a gay room. 
[00:35:30]  In a gay chat room?  Let's go to Steve in the Bronx.  The Bronx.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, man, how can I beat, man?  Chris Daughtry was the best one out of everyone.  It's unbelievable.  It doesn't make any sense.  For him to be in the bottom two, there was four left, and he was one of the two.  Well, he ends up having the least amount of votes for the week.  That's just impossible.  Yo, it's a fix, man. 
[00:36:00]  It's a fix.  You know, they decided to go for some kind of wrestling storyline.  Let's throw a curve into this damn thing.  They are completely controlling this behind the scenes, and they're making America think  that they're actually voting for their next American Idol.  I just don't believe it anymore.  That's unbelievable, man.  I'd rather buy a record for Mother Teresa than Taylor Hicks, man.  This guy is horrible.  I can't stand that guy.  Taylor Hicks is still in it, and that forgettable...  What's his name?  Elliot.  Elliot.  You see the guy's teeth, man?  He looks like he's got a mouthful of piano keys. 
[00:36:30]  Elliot is very forgettable.  The guy has no personality at all.  His voice is all right.  Stupid Paul Abdul put him over a couple weeks ago, though.  I'd hate to think she has that much power to put people over like that.  Chris could have gone out with a little more class, though.  He didn't have to stand there and look at McPhee and say, you know, I'm coming for your seed.  You know, that was a little much, bragging that he has a gun, and a little more class. 
[00:37:00]  He was stunned.  He stood on that stage when they told him, you know, he was out and just kind of looked around like, what?  This is a joke, right?  Everyone else, the judges, you looked at Simon's face, and he was like, he couldn't believe it.  There was no way she should have won out over him.  She was that bad.  It wasn't even close.  She was that bad.  She was that bad. 
[00:37:30]  I didn't like her hound dog rendition.  You ain't nothing but a shut up.  Oh, she was off key.  She's jumping around like she's just spasming on stage.  She has no psaas.  You know, she's got an all right body and everything.  She needs a treadmill.  She looks pretty good, but you can tell in a couple of years that baby fat's just going to turn into fat.  She's beautiful, but she needs a treadmill.  Yeah.  A little stair master action.  I suggest cardio three, four times a week, 30 minutes at a time. 
[00:38:00]  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you do what I do.  You just do the bike a little bit if you have a bad foot, then you sit in the steam room with your towel open a little farther than it needs to be.  Room full of men.  Let's say hi to Jim in Philly listening to us on WYSP.  Jim, what's up today?  Hello, Jim.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I got two things.  I'd rather watch skate porn with my mom than American Idol.  You can do both with DVR these days.  You know, a lot of people can't believe that we actually watch American Idol. 
[00:38:30]  I can't believe I watched the show, but for some reason I got hooked.  This is the first year I've watched it all the way through.  I'm done, though.  All the other years I couldn't be bothered.  I watched the auditions and watched all the silly people making fools of themselves.  That was fun TV.  But for some reason this year, and I think it was because of Chris Daughtry, I'm like, wow, this guy has a really cool rock voice.  I never watched it, and this is why, because I don't believe that they're going to get the best guy to win.  No.  That's why.  I don't understand this. 
[00:39:00]  Why don't, when they have the guys go on and the girls, they come on with their own original stuff.  What are you doing cover songs for?  If I want to do that, I go down to the bar and do karaoke.  I'm guessing, dude.  You know what I mean?  I've thought that, too.  And I'm guessing it's just because it's a point of reference.  So people at home can kind of judge.  Yeah, they've got to be familiar.  Because they know what Hound Dog sounded like when it was sung properly, and then they can hear it sung like that, and you kind of have a point of reference.  I'm guessing.  I don't even watch the show, so I'll shut my fat face.  All right.  Let's go to Jay in Jersey.  Jay, what's up?  Oh, but I think you nailed it 100%. 
[00:39:30]  I think you definitely are doing the Vince McMahon guy and Ruth.  The fix is in.  Well, you know, it gets everyone talking, you know?  But you see the three left, and you're like, come on.  I mean, they're good and stuff.  I like Taylor Hicks.  I think he's fun to watch, but he's no American Idol type that they're looking for.  No, I don't think so.  I don't even want to watch the show anymore.  I was watching it to see Chris Wynn, and I don't even want to watch it no more. 
[00:40:00]  The show sucks.  All right, thanks.  Let's go to Charlie in Jersey.  Was he even bald the whole time or no?  Huh?  Was he even bald the whole time?  Yeah.  Okay, I just haven't seen his face.  Yeah, he had the shaved head.  Charlie, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  I don't know if it's going to, if it has any of that, but there's a website out there called  votefortheworst.com, and the sole purpose of this website is to get people to vote for  whichever person does not deserve to be the American Idol.  So, there's a possibility, I mean, the American Idol people in the past, every year with their 
[00:40:30]  surfaces, they keep denying if there's any effect from this website, but when you get  down to this point, when the votes are so close, it's entirely possible, who knows?  That people who just kind of want to wreck the show.  Want to ruin the show.  All right.  That's kind of funny.  I like that.  It's a great idea, but if that was true, Chicken Little would still be it.  That Kevin Kidd from Long Island would still be it.  All right, well, then, you know, Chris Daugherty had us sing last night to say goodbye there. 
[00:41:00]  Ew, they let you sing once you're booted?  I would sing the F song.  Yeah.  No one's messed up about American Idol.  Yeah, you get booted, and then you got to sing the song that wasn't good enough.  That got you booted.  That got you booted.  You sing the song again.  That's kind of silly.  Which is pretty messed up.  That's stupid.  If they were smart over there, I really need a phone call from American Idol.  I could help them produce the show even better.  Oh, I'm sure that's coming.  When these guys get booted off, let them sing their best performance again. 
[00:41:30]  Let them sing their best performance.  You know, because Chris Daugherty gave a lot of people chills with some of the renditions  of some of the songs he did.  Yeah.  Do it that way.  Got him booted.  Why would you let the loser sing the song that wasn't good enough again?  Let them go out as stars.  And, you know, that one performance where it was like, oh, my God, everyone was just  ranting and raving about it.  Yeah.  I think if you lose, you should be forced to sing Al Yankovic's song. 
[00:42:00]  Get up in front of America and sing Eat It.  Yeah.  And smile like Al does when he sings it, you know, because it's just such a hoot.  You can't get it out without laughing.  Oh, hoot.  So here's Chris singing his last song on American Idol last night.  Just a piece.  Ladies and gentlemen, one more time, Chris Daugherty.  We're caught in a trap. 
[00:42:30]  I can't walk out.  Because I love you too much, baby.  Why can't you see what you're doing to me?  You don't believe a word I say.  We can go all together with suspicious minds. 
[00:43:00]  And we can build our dreams.  And there you have it.  Then they just cut to commercial.  Bye-bye.  You don't even give a crap.  They don't even let you finish it?  No.  Go to a Chevy commercial.  Yeah.  You're singing, you know, for the last time in Idol and the credits are rolling over your face.  Yeah.  It's over, Johnny.  Why would you do it?  And then all of a sudden the show just cuts off and it goes into a house promo or something.  I'll take a zipper and just sing Paul is a whore.  So, yeah, it's official. 
[00:43:30]  American Idol is just a joke.  It's fixed.  It's a joke.  And I think this is going to affect the show as they go forward with it.  Dude, whenever you think something with integrity is going to wreck things, it doesn't.  It doesn't.  Because people don't care.  More people will tune in now.  I like Taylor anyway.  Oh, isn't he great?  The way he dances.  He reminds me of my crazy uncle at the wedding.  Does he? 
[00:44:00]  He stinks.  All right.  And that brought, I don't know what she's doing.  She should have been gone like three or four people ago.  She's that bad.  She's that bad.  She can't sing.  She's off key all the time.  Two days ago when she sang her song, she got up there and when she was done, she stood in front of the judges and kind of went, eh.  She forgot the words.  She forgot the words to the song, turned her back to the camera to try to hide it, then turned back around. 
[00:44:30]  How is she still on the show?  It's just, no.  It's fixed.  When they sing other people's, like I was listening to other people's songs, sometimes if you close your eyes, you'd think it was the real person.  The real person.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  Instant feedback coming in like crazy today, by the way.  America voted, and I was supposed to win, and they threw me off the show.  I'll admit it.  When he handed me the fixed vote, it turned me on.  Too bad he didn't hand you an acting class. 
[00:45:00]  Okay, vote him off right away.  He's getting fresh.  Anyway, instant feedback like crazy today.  Now go get your microphone.  By the way, did you have to get me the orange, the infant orange?  Aw, look at that little orange.  Almighty, this is awful.  This belongs in a sack.  Give that to Big A.  We got to talk about Big A on this half of the Open Anthony Show. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, what a nightmare.  We'll get into that maybe after the break.  Instant feedback, Anthony.  You know, we're failures.  We're failures in radio to the point that we're talking to more people every day.  I love this failing.  We tried to be successful for so long, and it got us nowhere.  Now that we fail, this is great.  We have careers.  Instant feedback from someone's mobile device.  Could you guys please fail a little more and get syndicated out west? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, we're working on it.  We're working on it.  Hopefully more failure, more markets.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue with the dramatic conclusion to the New Jersey bear.  Who knew?  You heard it here first, people.  We're prophets.  We are prophets.  We certainly are.  We got the audio.  It's exactly how we said it was going to end.  This day and age, how do you not catch a bear?  Well, we'll get into it next, all right? 
[00:46:30]  Stay tuned for more Radio Awesome.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Hey, a couple plugs for some of the regulars of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony's brother, Joe, he's got a U2 tribute band, 2U.  They're playing Saturday night at Tuxedo Junction in Danbury, Connecticut.  10 p.m. show. 
[00:47:00]  Go see them.  We should get some WOW stickers up there.  Hey, good idea.  We'll try to get some WOW stickers up there for 2U at Tuxedo Junction in Danbury, Connecticut,  this Saturday night at 10 p.m.  You think you were watching the real U2?  And our own little Jimmy Norton is leaving for Boston after today's show.  He won't be on with us tomorrow.  He's got a big gig up in Boston with David Tell and Keith Robinson at the Orpheum in Boston.  Some tickets still remain, I think.  Yes. 
[00:47:30]  AT is sold out.  Boston, you can get paid.  And the benefit tonight, by the way, I've gotten a lot of emails for Masavia's son.  He's been sold out for a while.  It's often so.  Very cool.  I saw Keith at Caroline's last weekend.  He's got some funny new stuff.  Yeah, he's really funny.  Yeah.  He wasn't so stupid and lazy.  I want to get him on the show because he's really funny on the radio.  Well, he just comes with the territory.  He can't help it.  It's a two-for-one you get with melanin.  A couple updates really fast.  Bus model, a cover girl. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  This story from yesterday, one of the better stories we've seen in recent months.  Stunning runway queen, Russian name I can't pronounce, told the Post from her hospital bed yesterday  that she can't recall tumbling out of a motorhome onto a busy highway in Brooklyn on Tuesday.  Wonderful.  She says, I don't remember anything.  I was just walking out of the bathroom, and the next thing I remember, I was waking up in the hospital.  Oops.  So she went to the bathroom on this souped-up RV, right? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, big tour bus kind of thing.  And she steps out of the bathroom.  Yeah, and she's supposed to.  If Kenny would have fallen on the floor, that would have been funnier than a model falling out of the bus.  He almost fell off his chair.  You big lug.  She walked out of the bathroom, and I guess on this tour bus, the bathroom door, you get to it through another door in the bus.  It kind of keeps the stench down, I would guess. 
[00:49:00]  But there's also a third door that goes outside the bus, leaves the bus.  She made the wrong turn and ended up walking out that door.  Just opened it and stepped out onto the highway.  How dumb can you be?  Wouldn't you notice that there's wind and a road moving very quickly under you?  Yeah, I guess the bus was going about 50 miles an hour on the Gowanus Expressway.  Yeah.  She just stepped right off the bus as it's going 50 miles an hour.  The bus driver, I guess, just was looking at the side view at that moment and saw her just kind of tumbling down the road. 
[00:49:30]  Lucky for her.  Kind of checking his mirrors and sees a Russian model tumbling down the road.  Miraculously, she avoided being crushed by oncoming traffic.  Yeah.  People will break for hot models.  She was first taken to Lutheran Hospital with a broken arm and wrist as well as cuts and bruises.  She was later moved to Mount Sinai in Manhattan in case she needs facial surgery.  Uh-oh.  And then there's a quote from the fine model. 
[00:50:00]  She says, I have to be beautiful for people, the blonde, blue-eyed beauty said while insisting that her picture not be taken.  So there's an update on that.  Don't take my picture.  Not now.  I am not beautiful.  Ugh.  The Russian girls.  I have to be beautiful.  Like she's doing a public service.  Like if she's not beautiful for us, we won't know what to do.  Then you will all freak out.  You won't know what to do.  I'm so beautiful.  All the strippers these days, they're all Russian. 
[00:50:30]  What happened?  What happened to our American gals?  They've taken the fun out of going to a strip club.  And I'm not even talking about the high-class gerents.  I'm talking about your local dives.  What happened to your dream of maybe walking in and seeing the girl you went to high school with?  Yep.  Shaking it up on stage as you shove a dollar down a G-string.  Well, the good old stripper just trying to make some money for college.  The day stripper by the train station where every guy that walks out of the club makes  that look like Dracula if the sun comes up. 
[00:51:00]  You just can't take the sunlight.  You can't believe it's still light out because it's lunchtime, dancing with her cesarean scars.  Day strippers are great.  They're like the minor leagues.  Oh, the minor league.  Because if they had minor league ball in there.  Because if they were good enough, they would be stripping at night.  Oh, let's be honest.  They'd be at the gentleman's club, not the strip club.  It's called a gentleman's club.  They let you get away with murder, too, man.  If you've got a $10 bill, you can actually put a rubber band around your fist.  Get a put-up that way. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  But now they're all...  I remember the old days walking into some of the strip clubs out on Long Island.  And you could have a dopey conversation with the girl, especially during lunch when there's barely anyone in there.  She'd like...  I like when the music would end and she'd feel compelled to cover up as she's talking to you because there's no music playing.  They have some code of ethics.  I don't know what it is.  And then the music starts and whoosh, everything goes off and they start dancing.  But you'd have the dopey conversation because they were local girls, stuff like that. 
[00:52:00]  Have something in common.  Now, though, they all, even the lowest of the low strippers in these local strip clubs are Russian girls that think they're working at the nicest gentleman's club.  Would you like a lap dance for the 20?  I will make this sexy for you.  And do you come to the room in the back and get room in the back?  You just want to sit at the bar and nurse your Budweiser and have some fun. 
[00:52:30]  That's all.  Watch a girl dance.  I don't want to be extorted.  That's what they feel like.  Like every two seconds they're coming around and they're all pushy to get money.  A buck used to get you.  You didn't even need a buck.  You nurse your beer.  If your friend had a buck, you could share his dance.  He'd slip her a buck.  She'd dance in front of him.  And you'd just look.  You kind of lean over and take a little look.  And now it's just all attitude.  It's all attitude because the Russian girls don't know how to be like nice American girls. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, because they were like rocket scientists in Russia.  My father was the rocket scientist.  Our country is so much better than yours.  Now he drives a cab and I strip.  Yeah.  Great country.  You'd think they would have been humbled.  Yeah.  Be a little humble.  Don't talk about how our country was so much better than yours.  The Soviet Union before breakup, we had it all.  Better weapon, better technology, better scientists. 
[00:53:30]  I was an engineer at a factory that, what do you do now?  I have a hot dog cart and a cell here on the street.  Humble yourself.  Please humble yourself.  Stop.  We don't give a crap what you were in your other country.  You're in America now.  You were very scary back in the day, a very scary group of people.  And you had to take a drastic step down.  Yeah.  Some people have to step off buses as they're moving 50 miles an hour.  And she's still not humbled.  She's telling everyone she has to be beautiful. 
[00:54:00]  I have to be beautiful.  The people expect it from me.  You know, you talk the truth about the strip clubs, but also the Russian girls are now your waitresses in the restaurants.  Yeah.  Same attitude.  Diners and restaurants.  Same attitude.  Excuse me.  Could I have some butter, please?  One minute.  I am busy.  Really.  Just nothing but attitude.  And I'm really good to the waiters and waitresses because I eat out every single night.  I just don't feel like cooking for myself. 
[00:54:30]  And so, you know, we eat out almost every night.  And as soon as you see the Russian waitress coming your way, you're like, oh, great.  Here comes the attitude.  Yeah.  I just want a quick meal before I, you know, go to bed.  You get the rush key.  They really do stop being naked once the song stops.  It's irritating.  I don't understand that.  The song stops.  And I don't even, not even a place with a DJ.  Like, I'm talking, remember the jukebox where the girl would get up and dancing and it's just some bad, you know, girls, girls, girls is playing and she doesn't like it. 
[00:55:00]  And she picks.  Yeah.  Do you think it makes them self-conscious?  And she's dancing on their big heels and you're waiting for her to get into it.  And then she's like, Bobby, Bobby, could you reject this?  Could you, could you reject this?  And she's holding her clothes up to her boobs?  Reject.  I don't want to, I don't like dancing to this song.  This isn't what I like dancing to.  Could you just reject this song?  Oh, why are you covering up? 
[00:55:30]  Here's how it goes with the music.  Who can say the music doesn't?  Okay.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore in a bar.  I'm a naked whore in a bar.  Must cover up.  Must cover up.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I see.  However you need to play it out in your head, honey.  I hate this song, by the way.  It's awful.  In all conversations.  Now, making her way to the stage, let's bring up beautiful Taddy.  She used to be a Miami Dolphins cheerleader.  You might recognize her from her cover spread in Maxim magazine. 
[00:56:00]  Now she's just a stripper slut.  And we're lucky to have her here.  Let's bring up Portia, everybody.  Big hat for Portia.  Yeah, that was on her birth certificate, I'm sure.  I'm certain of it.  This is one of the staples for a strip club.  I just, I know.  I just don't like it.  How does that go again, Jimmy?  Dance, dance, dance.  Dance, I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm having, I'm just a whore.  I'm naked, and I'm a whore in a bar.  Dancing and having a good time.  That's all that matters. 
[00:56:30]  Clap your hands and show these for a bar.  Why?  What went wrong with my life?  Am I standing here?  There's sunlight coming in.  But I'm dancing, and I'm boogying.  And that's all that matters.  It's sexy, and it's fun.  And everyone's smiling, except for me, because I'm a dirty whore who should have went to college.  It's so true.  As soon as the song's over, end of conversation you were having.  All right.  So there's the update on the Russian model.  It's our melting pot.  Stepping out of a bus going 50 miles an hour. 
[00:57:00]  The other story we were on yesterday, the poor bear in New Jersey.  Aw.  Just wandering around trying to find some food.  That's all.  We go from women being bear to a bear story now, Opie.  Shut up.  Ugh, news segues.  The Jersey bear.  The Jersey bear.  Well, things didn't work out too well, did it?  We told you all how it was going to end. 
[00:57:30]  We didn't even know.  Matter of fact, we had the lady on the phone yesterday all concerned about the bear,  and we made believe they were killing the bear live as we were talking to her.  Yeah.  Well, that's pretty much how they ended up killing the bear.  Exactly how he described it.  All right.  Less the bear trap on his foot and him having to gnaw off his own little paw.  Didn't they have darts?  They said for some reason the darts weren't working.  Oh, they did try them darting?  I don't know.  They darted him.  It takes a while.  And I think it got too close to some children.  Who's 250 pounds? 
[00:58:00]  What, are they shooting Red Bull at him?  How hard is it to dart a 250-pound bear?  He didn't go down right away.  And I heard there was a girl, and she had a hula hoop, and the bear was coming closer to her.  Yeah, I hear the bear was within a mile of the girl, so they had to kill the bear.  Yeah, one mile.  Wow.  How about telling the girl at the hula hoop, hey, stupid.  Get inside.  Put that down before you're mauled.  Yeah.  Yeah, beat it, stupid.  Beat it with the hula hoop.  We're trying to catch this bear.  Scram, kid.  What was she on her 17th hour of the contest in 1956? 
[00:58:30]  Loop.  I'm not a big animal rights activist.  I've said it many times on the show, but that stuff is just ridiculous to me.  Absolutely.  It's like you can't freaking tranquilize a bear in the year 2006.  How about, or at least beat it to death with bats.  Taser it.  Yeah.  The police officer, the story says, just emptied his gun.  He did like five or six shots.  Oh, yeah.  They got a total of seven shots or something.  It was a black bear, and what happened was they shot it a bunch of times, and they realized  it was just reaching for its wallet. 
[00:59:00]  North Jersey cops fatally shot a 250-pound black bear yesterday after a two-day chase  that kept Newark and its suburbs on edge.  They were all on edge in Newark.  I don't think they were on edge in Newark over a bear.  I think they were on edge over some other things.  Yeah, the city's getting better.  Blah, blah, blah.  Newark's got its own issues.  Blah, blah, blah.  New mayor, by the way.  Yeah, great.  Over there in Newark.  I'll check out Newark in another five years.  After 20 years of having the same guy in there.  What the hell was his name?  I don't know.  Oh, you don't know what you mean. 
[00:59:30]  You guys in Newark.  Sharp James.  You guys in Newark, you just keep getting better.  I'll check you out in another five years.  Yeah.  Then we might drive through your city, and it might actually stop at a red light.  That's right.  Maybe.  Houston police said the bear, apparently confused and sickly, well, they got to throw that out  there because there's a lot of people very, very pissed off today, was cornered and shot  in an Irvington backyard because it had strayed too near a school area.  I hear it just went to a little fruit and vegetable stand that was trying to get an apple. 
[01:00:00]  Seven times.  We shot him seven times, and he's still alive.  Papa!  Papa!  My big fear was the kids starting to drift through from school, said Irvington Deputy Police  Chief Stephen Palomera.  Any animal that starts getting scared will be unpredictable.  Cops said they put the animal down at around 1.30 p.m. yesterday after he got up and moved  toward a Morris County Animal Control officer approaching with a tranquilizer gun.  Cop couldn't bear to see that. 
[01:00:30]  So the Animal Control Officer backed away, and one of the police officers shot him four  to five times.  Bared down on him.  It was a grizzly scene.  Ah, the poor thing.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Well, this goes against the bear being sickly.  The beast was hard to ignore since it was hopping backyard fences as if it was warming up  for the Olympic high hurdles. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, sickly.  When I came, the bear was jumping fences like he was an athlete or something.  Sounds sickly to me.  He looked sick around the eyes.  He didn't look like a typical healthy bear.  We said he was crying, didn't we?  Yes, we did say the bear was crying.  How did we know exactly what was going to happen?  We just had such an accurate depiction of how this was going to end.  We know how this is going to end.  It ends the same way every time.  Yeah.  It ends the same way every time.  Poor little guy. 
[01:01:30]  All right, here we go.  Some of the news stories, they're great.  They're great on the bear.  Black bear's adventures in a densely populated part of northern New Jersey costed its life.  And tonight, environmental activists say the bear didn't have to die.  The 300-pound animal was first spotted in Livingston yesterday.  After several sightings this morning in Newark, police cornered the bear behind a house in  Irvington.  When an officer tried to shoot it with a tranquilizer, police say the bear went up on its hind legs,  forcing the officer to shoot it dead. 
[01:02:00]  But the state Sierra Club says the situation was poorly handled.  They should have been chasing it back towards the north and to the woods and towards the  Basaic River and the Great Swamp, not into an urban area.  And it shows you the failure we had by not having a conservation officer on the scene.  The bear entered what's called a bear exclusion zone, which means state law permitted the use  of deadly force.  I don't think the bears can read the signs that says bear exclusion zone.  He was selling drugs near a school.  Bear exclusion zone. 
[01:02:30]  Poor thing gets tranquilized and gets up on its hind legs, probably to just show, hey,  look, I give.  Yeah.  He got on a unicycle and started juggling.  Put a ring to his own nose.  I'm harmless.  You make a good point, though.  That's not fair for the bear, because it doesn't read.  Oh, this is a bear exclusion zone?  Oh, I'll turn around.  I'm an idiot.  Right.  I better get out of here.  He was fighting to get other bears in.  He felt it was discriminatory.  I wish I had a bear exclusion zone in my neighborhood. 
[01:03:00]  Poor little guy.  We just have different rules for animals.  I think it's terrific.  Why can't we do that for humans?  The Sierra Club's got to relax.  I want an exclusion zone around my neighborhood.  I've got one in mind.  It's called the rent.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  The chase is over.  Police are forced now to fire on a 300-pound black bear prowling New Jersey neighborhoods.  Fox 5's Mike Sheehan has the story, but a warning.  Some of the images may bother you. 
[01:03:30]  Shut up.  It was certainly not the way animal lovers had hoped the chase would end.  Unfortunately, police officers say they were forced to fire seven shotgun rounds into the bear,  killing it in a quiet backyard on a dead-end street.  The bear they lost last night, they found it there, you know, in my backyard.  Animal control officers armed with a tranquilist gun say that when the bear was cornered,  it suddenly began to come toward them, and the order to shoot was given.  He looked like he was sick, you know, like he was all sick around the eyes. 
[01:04:00]  You know, he looked at it out of place, you know.  He didn't look like a typical healthy bear.  First spotted in Livingston on Tuesday morning, animal control officers and cops began the chase.  The 300-pound Bruin made its way to Newark early today and finally to Root Street in nearby.  I'm not Bruin.  But it was agile, real agile, because it hopped on the tree, hopped over the fence, you know.  I couldn't even hop over the fence that fast.  The carcass of the black bear has now been removed to an animal control center  where tests will be performed to see if it had any diseases. 
[01:04:30]  Mike Sheehan, Fox 5 News.  Seven shotgun shellitis.  No kidding.  No kidding.  And I'm sure before they dragged the bear off, they all jumped up and down on it a few times to make sure it was dead.  I'd like to know how that one gentleman...  We just stink as humans when it comes to living with animals.  I'd like to know how that one gentleman they interviewed knows what a healthy or unhealthy bear even looks like.  He didn't look healthy.  He looked like a sick bear.  He didn't look like a healthy bear.  Did that guy ever see a healthy bear? 
[01:05:00]  No.  Roaming around that neighborhood?  Timothy Treadwell, and you know what it got him?  What he deserved.  I have no mercy for the bear enough.  They don't appreciate niceness.  No.  Hello, bear.  Have a treat.  And they claw your throat.  Channel 9 did a fine job with the bear story.  By the way, I'm sure we lost some fine young men in Iraq.  They don't get any coverage, but it's all about the bear.  It's all about the bear.  Every day.  Every day we're losing soldiers. 
[01:05:30]  But, you know, it's more important to talk about the bear they killed in Jersey.  The bear suffered seven shots.  How does a bear walk around for 36 hours without being noticed?  They're looking for him on Tuesday and all of a sudden he disappears.  How do you let that out of your eyeline?  You know, they got helicopters watching him.  A bear is killed.  Shot down not in the wild, but in a backyard of a New Jersey neighborhood.  It's been making its way through the state, and today it came just too close for comfort.  Megan Vegas here now with more. 
[01:06:00]  Megan.  Well, Brenda, this bear has been on the loose for days, traveling from the New Jersey mountains  to the city streets of Essex County.  In the past two days, she has been spotted in West Orange, Newark, Livingston, and finally,  Irvington.  And while some people we spoke with say they did not want to see the bear shot dead,  they agree with the decision to shoot to kill.  I lived here for 10 years and never seen a bear.  The most I've seen was a skunk.  This was no skunk, it was a female black bear. 
[01:06:30]  An Irvington, New Jersey resident who saw the 300-pound animal were themselves running  scared.  I could have went in that backyard, and if I had seen that bear in that backyard, I wouldn't  have been in it anymore, because I'd just lay down and say, go ahead and eat me, bear.  Can we air that?  Wow.  She sure is good.  What a survival instinct on that woman.  Have I seen it?  Go ahead, eat me.  I don't care.  I'd even cut myself so I could smell the blood. 
[01:07:00]  I don't know, is that the right one?  Okay.  For police, the focus was always on public safety.  Once the bear was spotted, two local schools were placed in lockdown, and kids hanging out  in the neighborhood, they were told to get inside.  One girl with a hula hoop didn't get it, and the bear was next to her, and she just wasn't  looking that way.  But police were looking.  In fact, they never took their eyes off the animal.  He was jumping over six-foot fences like they were little curbs, and he was going from backyard 
[01:07:30]  to backyard.  The hope was to save the bear, so an attempt was made to tranquilize the animal.  But then...  He started to come forward towards me, so I had no other choice.  I told the officer to take the shot.  Come and ride for us.  I do humane stuff all day long.  I try to save the animals, but there's choices we have to make.  The choice was to shoot to kill.  At least a half a dozen shotgun blasts rang out to make sure the bear was dead and no  longer a threat.  I do feel sorry for the bear, but the whole idea is protecting public safety. 
[01:08:00]  Now, this is not the first time recently a bear has been shot and killed in an urban  area.  In fact, just days ago, another bear was killed in Trenton.  Some experts say it's a growing problem.  A bear is encroaching on our cities.  Bears encroaching on our cities.  A growing problem?  What cities?  We'll tell you.  Yeah.  One politician wants to take all the bears out of the wild and put them in a neighborhood.  The problem is it could be next to your honey factory. 
[01:08:30]  Morons.  They are just the worst, aren't they?  I love the fact they said the police didn't take their eyes off the bear.  Like, that's good police work.  You're not supposed to when there's a wild animal in Irvington.  Right.  There's the bear.  There's the bear.  There's the...  Oh, a butterfly.  Yeah.  Where did the...  Damn it!  I took my eyes off him.  I have the bear in my sights.  Oh, noon.  Time for lunch.  Gotta go.  I know, Ben. 
[01:09:00]  Stay there.  Ben's trying to get us to break.  Ben!  But we're flowing here.  Mike in Philly.  Can we shoot Ben seven times?  Mike, what's up?  Morning, guys.  Hey.  Was that really a bear or was that Mike Tyson?  Yeah, right.  Watch it out, fellas.  All right.  Steve's all upset today.  Misty-eyed?  Yes.  One of my own.  It's hard when you lose one of your own.  Yeah, well, a lot of people are making that...  I'm not going to be in tomorrow.  Have a funeral to attend.  New Jersey bear. 
[01:09:30]  One less in the club, huh?  Where is Steve today?  There's Steve the bear.  Aww.  Our own Steve.  Grr.  Yeah.  Grr.  He's even wearing his Stay Cozy t-shirt today.  I am.  Yes.  It's a tribute to my lost home.  Grr.  Yeah, you're all lucky.  He's got a Stay Cozy Bear shirt on.  Grr.  Aw.  You get a big wreath of flowers with H-I-P on it.  Hibernate in peace.  Grr.  Okay.  I thought it might have been funny. 
[01:10:00]  Apparently.  I kind of liked it.  I took my eye off the joke.  Someone shot it.  They didn't need to.  It just died a batch of causes.  Yeah, I'm sorry, Steve.  I'm sorry to hear about your loss.  Quite all right.  Funeral arrangements will be the same.  Yes.  We made this weekend.  E-Rock wants to know if you spilled some honey for your dead homie there.  Indeed. 
[01:10:30]  Very good.  Yeah, you dumped a little honey.  My homies.  The bear was seen wandering around with a drill looking for a peep booth.  All right, Steve.  All right.  Thanks for adding to this segment.  It was great.  It was one of his own.  You did a wonderful job.  A big furry bear, Steve.  It might be the highlight of the show today.  It was terrific.  It certainly was.  This is best of stuff.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  When we get back, we got David Lee Roth doing a country version of Jump. 
[01:11:00]  Ye effing ha.  I want to hear this.  Also, Voss is here.  Where's Rich?  We're going to have to have him do more stand-up on the street today.  Oh, my God.  We still haven't talked about Star getting fired.  Is this official?  It's over, Johnny?  For Star?  Oh, I thought you meant Star Jones.  Sorry.  Oh.  Yeah, that too.  That's just about official.  Really?  Going down.  Yeah, a lot of talk going on that she has pretty much done the second Rosie takes over. 
[01:11:30]  You think that was part of Rosie's deal?  Oh, let's not speculate.  Hmm.  Bunch of fat hens we are.  And can you save that one for your neighbors when you're having tea with the old ladies?  Hey.  Yeah.  Who get the crap about the view?  I'm concerned about the view.  Me.  Opie and Anthony.  These guys thrash.  Hard.  Come on.  No.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:12:00]  Mornings 6 to 9.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Rich Voss in studio.  Just a quick plug for tomorrow.  I don't know how this is going to work as we move forward, but the second half of the  Opie and Anthony show is going to be broadcast live here in New York City at RCS Experience  56th and Madison from 9.30 to 11.30-ish. 
[01:12:30]  Ish.  Ish.  We're going to figure it out tomorrow, but especially for the people listening to us on  Free FM in New York City, chance to come out and say hi.  Reconnect.  We haven't seen you guys in a few years, maybe four years, some of you, and I think we'll  have a lot of wow stickers there as well.  Second half of the Opie and Anthony show broadcasting live tomorrow from RCS Experience, 56th and Madison  from 9.30 to about 11.30.  Okay?  Love those live broadcasts.  A couple phones to get to here. 
[01:13:00]  1-866-313-FREE.  We'll start with Shane in Florida.  Shane, what's up today?  Shane?  Yeah, Anthony said tummy.  I said tummy?  You said Jimmy's little tummy and that toddler talking that's really gay.  Well, not gay, sir.  That's the way we communicate around here.  Two men pointing out each other's tummy?  That's right.  Why not?  And did I say no homo?  No, you didn't say no homo.  Tummy, no homo.  It's really bad, too. 
[01:13:30]  Your radio's bleeding over the cell line.  What's that?  All I hear is loud music in the background.  It's horrible.  Oh, my God.  Why?  What's the matter?  Yeah, and I'm listening on pay for it, actually.  I'm not that free crap.  Hey, Shane.  You guys suck.  Punching out.  Look at him.  He doesn't want to stay around.  He wants to blur things out and then leave.  The reason the music was so loud during his phone call, it was to try to make the phone  call a little more exciting.  No, your lines really suck.  Didn't work.  No, I was cranking the music.  The music's being played.  Yeah, it sucks.  Because I really thought that your phone call needed some help. 
[01:14:00]  That's right.  A little music bed.  That's what they do when you watch a TV show to make things set up.  Pumps it up.  Makes it a little more dramatic.  A little more drama.  All right.  Thank you, Shane.  Let's say hi to John.  John, what's up?  Hey, good night.  Greg, Tony, Jim.  What's up?  How you doing, John?  Thanks for calling the program.  Go.  Where are those pussies from Boston today after a Sox and Fox lost last night?  Yeah, Curt Schilling didn't look too good last night, Ben.  Yeah, Schilling.  Schilling finally had a bad outing. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, Jack.  The difference is Schilling will do this now.  Randy will do it now.  And then he'll do it again in October.  Randy sucks, too.  But David Ortiz was four for four.  Woo-hoo.  Go, Yang.  Dude, I can't hate David Ortiz.  He is just ridiculous.  I love the guy.  Don't even worry about it.  He is ridiculous.  Somebody needs to plunk the guy in the head.  No, they don't.  He murders the Yankees better than any Yankee killer.  Jeronimo Barola.  I mean, there's been so many guys that murdered the Yankees over the years.  He is a Yankee killer.  Wow.  And you cannot, you know, you could hate the guy. 
[01:15:00]  He's a Boston Red Sox.  I can't stand him.  But you've got to respect a guy that can just get up there and smash that ball like that.  And you've got to respect the pitching staff.  How about this?  Intentional walk, dummies.  There you go.  How about this?  Put the catcher's mitt out to the left.  Stand up and give him first base.  Pitch around him.  Especially in Yankee Stadium with a short push to left field.  What is it?  108 feet?  Bucky Dent bunted the ball over the left field fence.  And you're still not a fan of Giambi, even though he has been coming to the table now. 
[01:15:30]  I don't want the big money.  I don't want that.  When everyone complains about the Yankees, and look, I'm sorry, Boston's not a small market.  You guys spend a lot of money.  But everyone complains about the Yankees doing this stuff and spending all the money.  And I want farm system guys.  I want Bernie Williams.  I want Jeter.  I want Mariano Rivera.  I want Andy Pettit.  I want Posada.  You know, if stupid Steinbrenner was with the Yankees all those years, he would have traded  those guys off for over-the-hill pitchers, and we never would have had Jeter.  We never would have kept Mariano Rivera. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, he goes for these names that are just, you know, has-beens.  They've been, you know, they were great at one time.  They're a name, so he wants them on the Yankees.  Bring up.  That's right.  Cultivate a team.  That's why that team was so great in their dynasty.  That's when you get the great players like Derek Jeter to get them all the young, not  the old fogies.  Right, Derek?  Uh, dog.  I can run the rookie shortstop.  I can run the rookie shortstop. 
[01:16:30]  I'm not your daddy six.  Everyone loves doing their mad dog.  Look, A-Rod is good, but I wanted, I liked Alfonso Soriano, because he looked like a black  version of the Vietnamese guy that Kevin Gillen hit with the rifle in Platoon.  Wow.  You see that head come apart?  See a head come apart like that?  Big teeth.  I loved them.  I'd rather listen to Dolores talk about the Yankees than you.  First of all, this is why you have no friends.  Why?  Because, A, it's an obscure reference, and B, her name was Doris. 
[01:17:00]  Stupid.  Dolores.  And with that, we've got to welcome Rich Voss to the program.  Dolores.  Good old Rich Voss is here.  Did you stop smoking?  The last time we talked to you, you said you were going to stop smoking.  Well, we'll talk about that, but did you, uh, last night, did you guys-  Wait, you're going to tell us what we're going to talk about?  Oh, no, no, no.  Yeah, you don't run the show.  There you go.  All right, let's go.  I want to see.  Let's throw him a bone and let's see him.  All right, let's see what he's got.  All right, let's see what he's got.  No, I don't have to.  Let's go, Rich.  Last night, did you see-  Last night, did you see-  I got a good story for you.  Last night, did you see-  The new Dateline. 
[01:17:30]  Did you see the new, uh, the new Predator ones?  Uh, I think it's called the Star and Buck Wild Show.  Wow.  I heard one of the guys brought his kid.  He brought his kid.  Oh, my God.  And he was married.  Just when you thought the show couldn't get any better.  Wow.  It's the best reality show on TV.  Was he abusing his own kid?  Do we have that audio?  Do we have the audio of, uh, the Predator bringing his own kid?  And he brought the kid to the address that was, uh, the police were using.  He was trying to teach the kid how bad the internet could be, so he brought him there. 
[01:18:00]  And he was going to see another boy, not a girl.  He was going to see, like, a fortunate old boy.  He's almost got an excuse there.  That's what he was doing.  He's got the Pete Townsend excuse.  He was bringing that kid-  I was just doing research, because he's seen enough datelines.  And say, look, if I bring a kid, then I could go in there, and if anything happens,  it's like, hey, I was showing how dangerous this is.  Look, hey, son, I walk into this house.  This kid's alone.  This could happen to you.  Be good on the internet.  Right.  How about this?  If you want to help the kid out, how about printing out a transcript of your own conversation 
[01:18:30]  and handing it to the police and going, you better go check on this kid.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Print out your own, uh, uh, conversation that you had to get to the point where you're  going to the house.  Wait.  Because I'm sure that was full of, uh, chock full of good stuff.  So he brought his kid.  What happened?  Well, he brought his kid, and then the guy comes out, uh, whoever's the guy.  Oh, the host.  Mr. Smarmy.  What?  We're here, and there seems to be someone at the door.  We'll wait until he enters before we make ourselves known. 
[01:19:00]  Ugh.  Do we have audio?  Talk like a human being.  Ugh.  Hey, someone is saying, I can't confirm this, some dude from, uh, Detroit on the instant feedback,  and this is what this guy's saying.  He's being shot at?  We have no idea.  It's Detroit.  Uh, allegedly.  Does that help us out if we say allegedly?  I don't know.  Uh, probably not.  It all depends on what you're going to say.  We really don't know, but he's claiming, uh.  Where is it, Detroit?  Let me see.  A little, uh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  No, you can't say that.  Why?  Why?  It's this guy saying that this is, uh, no? 
[01:19:30]  No.  You can't accuse somebody of that.  Why not?  Why not?  We're being accused, uh.  Yeah, but it's our response.  We're being accused of being failures, and we're not failures.  There are instances where even in the newspaper when something's quoted, you can't say it as fact.  I just got the thumbs up from Elo.  Did you read that?  I just got the thumbs up from Elo.  He's saying it's okay.  An FYI.  He just waved off the fastball and said go with it, right? 
[01:20:00]  Go with the curveball?  Pitch out.  Pitch out?  All right.  We got to intentionally walk and move on.  Uh, Voss, go ahead.  Can I say it?  Yeah.  What you're reading?  No, you can't.  No.  We're responsible for whatever goes on in these airwaves.  It's like us going, you shoot him.  Right.  Buck Wilde didn't say crap, and he's fired too.  Right.  See how that works, Spock?  See how that works?  Now listen to me.  And believe me, I've been in that seat before, my friend.  You.  I've been the innocent guy that had to take the fall because Opie's great idea, oh, the 
[01:20:30]  mayor's dead.  You.  Hey, man.  You've been the innocent guy.  How about little Jimmy Norton?  Oh, shut up.  Good point.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Good point.  I bought a new car the day before they got fired.  He walks in with a kid.  Your idea of a new car is anything with under $50,000.  It's.  Oof.  Oof.  So.  So what happened, boss?  So he walks in with the kid, and the guy comes running out, says, look, we're not going  to bring cameras here because you have your kid. 
[01:21:00]  Because you have your kid.  You know, and we don't usually have kids here, so he's a decoy.  You don't have, you know, we're going to let you walk out, whatever.  So he walks out with the kids, and the cops come.  Of course.  And these cops come running.  Instead of handcuffing you, they go get, and they throw you to the ground.  It's like they.  That's what they do.  But all they got to do is say, put your hands behind your back.  No.  They wouldn't even take a chance.  That's what they do.  I've seen some things.  Now, maybe if you're walking out of the house, they could kind of, you know, put your hands 
[01:21:30]  behind your back kind of thing.  But I've seen it where, especially on cops, it's some of the funniest footage you'll  ever see.  And it happens a lot where there's a car chase.  This guy's banged up 50 cars, put a police officer's lives in danger.  Then they run out of gas or crash.  They get out of the car, smile, and put their hands up like, you got me, and expect the  cops to just go, could I have your right hand, please?  Your left.  And three cops just blindside him.  It's part of the fun of being a police officer is the right to be able to do that. 
[01:22:00]  Now, how old was the kid he had with him?  It's probably, I don't know, he probably was like five or six.  He was a little odd.  He's probably, how nasty was the conversation he had with the boy?  Well, they didn't show the transcript, but they snapped, they threw him to the, or handcuffed  him.  A lady talked to the kid.  Kids start crying?  Well, they didn't, they blanked his face out, so, you know, I mean, because there's predators  watching these shows getting off, so they blanked his face off.  Right.  But this creepy thing was, they took him to the police station, but they had the wife come 
[01:22:30]  pick up the kid.  I mean, how awkward is that?  Just a little awkward.  It's awkward after your husband tried to molest another boy, not even a girl, a boy.  I'm sure you had, I'm sure you had a few awkward moments during your marriage.  At that point.  I had a few during mine.  At that point, you gotta just throw the kid away.  But now, it's like, he's damaged goods, man.  You got a father that's into that, the mom's gotta.  Never does mommy have to pick the kid up while you're being accused of molestation.  Boss, how many times were your daughters waiting in the car of a rest area, and they saw 
[01:23:00]  you getting chased out by other men, and you were like, I'm misunderstanding, kid.  Let's go, let's go, let's go.  Forgot your shaker, forgot your shaker.  I was just trying to get a soda.  I was tired.  You want to go to Disney?  Don't tell mommy where we stopped.  So, boss, you didn't stop smoking?  Not yet.  You promised us the last time you were on the show you were going to stop smoking on  Monday.  Yeah.  Or whatever it was.  You said Wednesday, Wednesday.  Wednesday things.  You're like Lady Di.  You got an excuse every day.  A brand new excuse every day. 
[01:23:30]  I'm going to a hypnotist next week.  Oh, wonderful.  Hypnotist now.  And stupid me, I saw like a patch on his ear.  I'm like, oh, cool.  You stopped smoking.  That's the nicotine patch, right?  And what did you tell us?  No, they cut off a mole.  Great.  I get moles.  You had a CIA person on your ear?  Cut it out with the wordplay, Jim.  Cut off a mole.  You thought that was one of the patches?  A nicotine patch there?  By the way, someone was explaining that the date line yesterday was very aggressive because  it's Florida and you could carry in Florida. 
[01:24:00]  They're thinking that.  Oh, so they're thinking some of the people are armed?  They're thinking there was a lot more people that could, you know, be carrying a gun.  Well, do we have audio of that Chris guy?  Yeah, we're getting that right now.  Let's say how to dug out Doug, one of the fine O&A pests.  Dug out Doug.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  No time to dilly-dally.  This is Free FM.  Hey, Ridge Voss.  Hey, what's up, man?  Thanks for coming out.  Hey, thank you.  Would you like to talk about the Virginia Beach milkshakes at all?  Oh, man.  I almost went to the bathroom on myself on stage. 
[01:24:30]  The whole show, son, I was curled over and I was on stage and gas was pouring out and  the audience could hear it.  I still did an hour and 20, but I was in so much pain and he was going, oh, I hope it  happens.  I hope it happens, you know, for me to.  Yeah.  It was just horrible, horrible.  You had to do your whole set while you had the gas pains?  What happened is I had the no-fat milkshakes, so it's like a no-fat yogurt, but it's all  full of air in the no-fat yogurt, you know, and this is exciting radio, and it just killed 
[01:25:00]  my stomach.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't an easy show.  So just have a few cigarettes, relax yourself, and like how you change the stuff.  Hey, what were you saying about Dugout Doug, by the way?  I said Dugout Doug's a great guy and he handed out stickers, but what would possess a man to  come to a show three weeks, three times in one week, even though I did a lot of different  stuff every time, right?  It was a different show every time.  You're such a great comedian.  It is creepy when someone shows up three times.  One time, you're like, hey, that's so cool of you to support me, man.  I like that. 
[01:25:30]  Thank you.  Then they come back the second night and it's like, oh, that's a little weird, but maybe  he has friends that couldn't show up Friday, so he's bringing them by Saturday to, you  know, help me out.  And then Sunday, like, all right.  Dude, what are you doing?  What are you doing, man?  No homo here.  Didn't you see an eye peeking through your hotel window?  And did you meet that bald guy that was there Sunday?  Bald guy?  Yeah.  The guy that came from Jersey.  Oh, I keep forgetting his name.  All right.  Dug, anything else? 
[01:26:00]  Apparently, I hit gold going the third night, though, because I got to hear a comedian that's  been on TV fart on stage.  Oh, that was you farting?  All right.  Dug, thank you.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye.  One too many.  Hey, Doug.  It's too late.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  One too many.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to see if you guys sort of previews for next week on the Predator  show.  No.  Oh.  There's some guy running around the house naked chasing a cat with cream.  He walks in naked.  Are they just doing this every week now? 
[01:26:30]  It's like an American Idol audition.  They're doing the outtakes.  Vote for your favorite Predator.  Someone should do that online, man.  William Hong walks in.  With the American Idol music.  You'll find out he's not.  Just the American Idol music.  Get judges and all that.  Crazy Willie stomping around the kitchen with a boy's life in his hand.  Kicked out of the house for not lasting long.  The one guy walked in the other night.  The other night.  He was real fat.  They sat him down.  They're always like a mess. 
[01:27:00]  Of course.  He goes, I haven't done this in a while.  I haven't done it in Florida yet.  Oh, great.  So they said wherever he used to live.  He goes, well, did you do it there?  He goes, yes.  Did you get caught one time or whatever?  So he's saying, I've done it before.  And the guy said to him, well, if the girl said yes, would you have done it?  And he said, well, most likely.  He goes, I kind of knew that this was a setup.  I felt that way.  And it's just sweat and grossness.  Don't these guys know to lawyer up immediately? 
[01:27:30]  Just keep your yapshot.  Why are they talking to these people?  I mean, I'm glad they are.  Believe me.  These guys should just be thrown away, locked up and throw the key away.  Whoa.  That's what I say.  Easy answer.  That's what I say all the time.  That's powerful, Anthony.  I know.  But they're pretty stupid.  Just they sit there.  Yeah, I would have done it.  Yeah, sure.  I'd have probably killed it, too.  Tell you the truth.  And then they haul them off.  One more call.  Lawyer up.  Bob in Florida. 
[01:28:00]  Bob?  Hey, guys.  On the episode before, the one that Voss was talking about, one of the Predators was  a midget.  And they asked him to go to the counter and sit on the stool.  He had to climb up the stool.  I know what he goes through.  Are you kidding?  Now stop it.  What was his excuse?  He just went there to trade clothes with the kid?  The kid would have done something with him until he shook the midget's hand.  A midget pedal.  Don't finger their growth.  Your hands are fat. 
[01:28:30]  Close to the same side.  Yeah.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  I'm not telling you why.  All right.  Hey, Rich Voss.  What's up?  Are you going to continue the Starbucks comedy tour today?  Yeah, I'll do a spot.  Rave reviews on you doing your stand-up at Starbucks.  You know, I think it was going...  Rave reviews.  I'm telling you.  It was hilarious.  I almost signed a deal with Krispy Kreme, a development deal.  But I keep picturing those two ladies by the counter staring at me in disgust. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  You know, but the set was going good, and then Anthony goes, oh, we got to cut it loose.  Cut it off.  You know.  I did not cut off your spot.  Yeah, you said, okay, wrap it up after I did the one joke.  No, I said, you go as long as you want.  That ruined your whole thing.  You did the A-bomb joke.  You could not possibly finish.  He pretty much...  I can't even repeat it here.  I said something about a male's anatomy.  Right.  But I didn't know there were kids in the audience. 
[01:29:30]  Yes.  What kids drink coffee in the morning?  Apparently a lot.  You know.  There's a whole wide class there.  But you were working the crowd too much.  Yeah.  I want to see material.  But he's good at crowd work.  Yeah, but give him something first.  You're coming.  You know, you walk out there, give him something.  You're right.  Well, I opened up with something.  I don't know.  It's tough to do comedy too when a manager is running at you.  Exactly.  That's why we want to see it.  That's the first time in your career that's ever happened. 
[01:30:00]  First of all, that's why I wanted one of those...  Right.  That's why I wanted one of those taser guns.  That would have been perfect.  All right, listen.  Right, you could have tased her.  We got to take a quick break.  The deal is Rich Voss is here for the rest of the show.  And he's going to continue the Starbucks comedy tour today.  So if you want to join us, this is what happens every day.  It's great.  We do two radio shows, basically.  The first half is heard on some fine terrestrial radio stations.  CBS.  And then the second half of the Opie and Anthony show is heard exclusively on XM. 
[01:30:30]  What we do as soon as we leave the air here, the first part of the show for the terrestrial radio stations,  we broadcast live all the way to our XM studio.  And we try to have fun on the streets.  So today, once again, Rich Voss doing his comedy at another Starbucks.  That's unbelievable.  So if you want to join us, meet outside around, I don't know, 8.50, 8.55 this morning.  A little more of an audience might help because the ones at Starbucks are not very receptive to your act.  I can't believe Doug's not handing out stickers in front of it. 
[01:31:00]  And we'll have stickers today, hopefully, because a lot of fans are out there looking for the new stickers.  It's going to be Starbucks wild.  Get it.  It's like the one.  Oh.  There's some real horrid puns going on today.  I don't know where they're coming from.  We don't do this every day, but bad puns.  So were you chasing that beer in Livingston?  What language was that?  What language was Rich Voss just speaking?  Was I chasing what beer in Livingston?  A beer in Livingston. 
[01:31:30]  That's what I don't even know.  I need my Voss to English translation.  Is there a website?  Look, he's turning red.  Why would I ask if I was chasing him?  Was it a gay bear or just a regular bear?  Keep going.  Don't ask me to help you.  Keep going.  Don't ask me to question.  Where's the shovel?  I'm not an audience member.  Let him dig deeper.  All right, Ben is flailing.  We've got to take a break.  There's nothing I want to see more than a latte fly at his face.  I can't wait.  What do you do for a living? 
[01:32:00]  I'm a pitcher.  Fuck.  I can't wait.  I hope someone throws a steaming hot cup of coffee on your face.  That's nice.  A piping beverage right in your thumb.  That's right.  A piping hot beverage.  When we get back, we'll talk about Starr and Buck Wild.  Yeah.  Oops.  Ouch.  Oops.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue.  Opie, the bone crusher, Hughes, plus Anthony, the hitman, Kumia, equals Party City.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, all right. 
[01:32:30]  Sounds good.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  Yeah, you're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio  and also CBS Radio.  CBS Radio.  It's a little awkward once again this morning because we've got both bosses in the studio.  Both of our chicks are in the same room.  What do we do?  Joel Hollander's here.  Actually, I've been in this situation.  Who's older?  You get thrown out.  The truth hurts, but it's there. 
[01:33:00]  What can I say?  Joel Hollander goes in for a hug, and I'm like, I can't hug you in front of Eric Logan.  You can't.  Eric shifts.  It's just weird having two bosses, that's all.  But Joel wants to say something on our fine program.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing great.  We finally feel comfortable.  The studio is all done.  The studio's fantastic.  I tell you, everybody at CBS has been very, very cool with us.  We came here not knowing really what was going to happen, brand new situation, especially 
[01:33:30]  with the old situation, and it's been nothing but an ass kiss fest.  We've loved it.  And the studio looks great.  That's why I came over.  I wanted to see the studio.  It's unbelievable.  Hey, Elo, you hear that?  The studio looks great over here.  Headphones aren't working.  He's saying his headphones aren't working.  You don't have those problems with satellites.  We're still waiting to say that our studio looks great at XM.  They've made some changes and built a studio for us, but... 
[01:34:00]  I just want to tell you guys something.  Yes.  Wasn't it about 10 years ago when Marc Messier guaranteed the Stanley Cup?  Yes.  Here's what I'm going to guarantee today.  On our show?  Yeah.  Should we call the AP?  Here's what I'm going to guarantee.  All right.  You're going to be on more radio stations.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  But let me be clear.  But Howard's saying we're failing, so why would you ever do that, being the big boss  that you are?  But that has nothing to do with anything, because let me be clear. 
[01:34:30]  Adam Carolla, Rovert, sports junkies, we're very committed to those guys.  They're doing better every day.  But there's a lot more real estate, isn't there?  Yes, there is.  There's a lot of real estate.  Is my dream going to come true, and we're going to be heard in Allentown, Pennsylvania?  You know what?  We'll get Billy Joel to sing at the opening.  We might have to get Fareed in for that one.  Yeah, really.  But we're going to make that guarantee today.  Reno, here we come.  A lot more radio stations.  A lot more radio stations.  Yeah.  At some point in time, you know, we're getting calls all the time. 
[01:35:00]  Opie, we are failing so good.  Yeah.  Howard said we're failing, so if this is failing, we're going to continue to fail for everybody.  All the other broadcasters are calling, you know, when are you going to be available,  which, you know, I think is pretty interesting, because 30 days ago, nobody would touch you  with a 10-foot pole.  Yeah.  So you guys deserve a lot of credit.  You know, but I'd like to believe this, but it's coming from Joel Hollander.  What does this guy have to do with the company?  And the most important thing is the advertisers are flocking back. 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  And we welcome them.  Tom Chisano can't answer his phone fast enough.  And Alan Leinwand, and Mark Cannon in Boston, and Peter Kleiner in Philadelphia.  It's great.  We've been meeting with people, Pro Flowers, Vermont Teddy Bear, everybody.  And it's been a love fest in the conference room over there.  It's just been a love fest.  And the next thing I have to do, I have to get John Sterling on for Ed Norton over here.  Ed Norton.  Ed Norton.  Ed Norton.  Yeah.  Please tell me he did that on purpose. 
[01:36:00]  Because if he didn't, it's just so typical of how I am.  At least he knows half your name.  That's a good start.  I said Ed Norton because I'm a huge Honey Motors fan.  Yeah.  There you go.  Well, that's great news, Joel.  All right.  That is really cool.  Have patience.  Have a great time.  And I just wanted to say that's what happens when you guys are failing.  Guaranteeing more stations.  Give us a hint.  What city?  No.  What city?  You know how this works.  What city?  Chicago?  I have no idea.  There is protocol for this kind of thing.  If you screw this up, I'm going to smack you over the head. 
[01:36:30]  I'm smacking you.  You've changed, man.  Yes, I have changed.  We're sitting here.  A mortgage will change a person.  With the head muckety-muck telling us that more stations are in our future.  And there's a guy named Star sitting, crying, watching television.  I don't want to be that guy anymore.  I want to know what city right now.  Shut up.  You've changed.  A mortgage will change a person.  Joel, I don't want Opie to be a reflection of the entire program. 
[01:37:00]  There is a duality of man that goes on here.  The dynamic of this program.  He still needs a little bit more radio rehab, maybe.  Radio rehab or a punch in the face.  And I'm not alone because Jimmy will pile right on and hit him also.  I'll hold him down and unbuckle his pants while you teach him a lesson.  All right.  Thanks, you guys.  Have fun.  All right.  Joel, thank you.  Joel Hollander.  We're failing so badly that more stations are going to be added.  More stations. 
[01:37:30]  You dope, Howard.  The failure we are doing.  Continue with your lies.  If we can just keep failing like this.  All right.  Call AP.  And Elo, any announcements for us today?  Elo, what do you got for us, Elo?  Joel Hollander.  Joel Hollander.  Great announcement.  Guaranteeing more stations.  Elo, what do you got?  I got nothing.  I love pitting these two guys against each other.  It's great.  It's like we're children of divorce. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And we're getting good presents from one parent and the other parent has to step up now.  We'll see what Elo does to step up.  My goodness.  Very good.  Call me Ed.  He called you Ed.  Look at that.  I'm such a nobody.  You.  He doesn't even know I'm in the room.  He shouldn't.  Well, he shouldn't.  You're my best friend and I don't know you're in the room.  Rich Voss.  The only person that's going to know your name is your oncologist. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, I like that.  Come on.  I like that one.  It's a cancer doctor.  Oh, I like that.  All right.  Thank you.  Don't crash.  I didn't get it.  It was intelligent humor.  It was very clever.  But I knew it was nice.  Thank you, Opie.  I like how you're stepping it up.  Now we got to do a poopy joke to balance it out here.  That's right.  Poopy joke.  I can't believe you said Allentown.  You were saying that because I'm there this weekend.  Is that why you said Allentown?  Were you joking?  Wow.  Your career is taking off.  I'm doing a joke.  Oh.  You know what?  No, what was your game?  No, I'm not plugging.  I thought you said it.  Shut up and plug.  Where?  At Wisecrackers at the Ramada.  Now and now. 
[01:39:00]  Wisecrackers at the Ramada?  It's a comedy club.  I don't care.  It's an hour from my house.  I'd rather perform on the cracker that was in the circle of a bunch of guys.  And then eat it.  God bless you.  Ah, thank you.  All right.  Let's move on.  But, yeah, he called you Ed.  Ed.  He wasn't kidding.  He wasn't kidding.  He tried to cover it up.  That was a good one.  There was some joke in there.  Do you have a Tell's intro for tomorrow night?  Do you have his intro?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I'll say how about a nice hand for Keith and Dave. 
[01:39:30]  He's playing the Orpheum in Boston, and you're going to make fun of that?  Yeah.  Listen, first of all, he attacked me first.  Failure, Jim.  Or actually, Ed.  Or Ed.  I'm just going to call him Ed the rest of the day.  I don't like being called Ed.  Obviously, Jim's a big failure, and you're a huge success, Mr. Voss.  According to certain people's rules, yes.  Yes.  No, Dave and I are just flip-flopping.  I go on last one night, he goes on last the next time.  Good.  This is going to be a great show.  I wish I could come see your show.  All right, speaking of radio, let's get into the story of the day here. 
[01:40:00]  I love you.  Yeah, this one's a biggie.  We've been in this boat before.  Yeah.  Let's start with the newscast.  It'll set it up nice, all right?  Great.  Is that cool, and then we'll go with it?  Sounds good, man.  If we need to stop the tape, just whatever, just do it.  Oh, yeah, whatever, because my ears are clogged, you know, being in the sewer.  We're on the air.  Jimmy, your ears are clogged?  Yeah.  You want to do a mic check to make sure you can hear yourself?  I can't.  Ben, what are you taking your headphones off?  Ben doesn't like Jimmy's mic checks. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, please.  How's it sound?  Good.  All right.  Popular DJ from Power 105 is suspended.  It happened late this afternoon after war of words between competing DJs called in the  middle a four-year-old girl.  I would just do supporter Jeff Rossin here now with the story.  Jeff?  And clearly this feud is getting out.  I'm so glad everyone was listening to me this morning.  I want to know.  This is this.  Uh-oh.  A disgusted Opie. 
[01:41:00]  What happened?  Well, first of all, it says suspended.  So this is from last night when we were in the office at, what, 515, trying to wake the  up, we were watching the Fox 5 newscast, and I said to Ben, I go, Ben, I want the Fox  5 newscast of this, because it's the updated version.  Can we go through the responsibility merry-go-round here?  I love this.  Whose fault is it?  Let's see the fingers point.  But he's still suspended.  It's not Steve.  We have updated audio that we can play.  Steve has stepped out of the picture completely and said he's not even involved.  Ben, your fault?  Probably.  You want to pull? 
[01:41:30]  Ooh.  No, we'll play this, because this is all we have now.  Ah, Bob, Bob stops here.  Steve's got a built-in excuse.  I was grieving in Livingston.  And Fox always does a better job, because they, you know, sensationalize it and all  that crap.  Popular DJ from Power 105 is suspended.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It happened late this afternoon after...  Wait, I thought he got fired.  See, this wrecks this whole thing.  Did Steve walk up to the cops in Livingston with a black veil on and smack one of them  in the face?  You knew that bear was in the neighborhood and you did nothing? 
[01:42:00]  The war of words between competing DJs caught in the middle, a four-year-old girl.  I would just say supporter Jeff Rossin here now with this story.  Jeff?  And clearly this feud is getting out of control.  DJ Starr from Power 105 actually went on the air and threatened sexual assault against  a four-year-old girl.  That girl is the daughter of a rival DJ on Hot 97.  Tonight, DJ Starr has been suspended.  Now local leaders want him arrested. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, yes, I'll come for your kids.  Yeah.  I will come for your kids.  Man, I finally got the information on his, uh, s***-eyed h*** wife.  The voice on the tape is Troy Torian, a.k.a. DJ Starr, morning man on hip-hop station Power 105,  using his microphone to threaten a little girl with sexual abuse.  The little girl is this woman's daughter, who cried today just hearing the tape.  Yes, I've disrespected your seed.  If you didn't hear me, I said I would like to do an R. Kelly on your seed. 
[01:43:00]  On your little baby girl.  He threatened to molest my little baby girl, as he calls her.  He put an offer out for the whereabouts of their school.  I am so concerned for my children.  Her husband is Hot 97's DJ Envy, father of the little girl, threatened.  And even though this feud is between these two men, DJ Starr went after the innocent child.  Where does this kid go to school? 
[01:43:30]  I got 500 bucks for that information.  Come on, email me and give me a call.  Just tell me where this kid goes to school.  The guy who put this over the radio is clearly a loser, pedophile.  Today, several New York City council members got together, demanding his immediate firing.  Under pressure, the radio station and its corporate parent, Clear Channel Communications, buckled.  Telling Eyewitness News, Power 105 finds the comments alleged to have been broadcast by Troy Turian to be wholly unacceptable.  We have removed him from the air, pending a full investigation. 
[01:44:00]  Does he have to bring a child into the radio station and molest her during the broadcast in order for Clear Channel to say,  you know what, maybe they've gone a little bit too far.  What does it take?  Late today, a New York City councilman called the suspension a move in the right direction and went on to call DJ Starr a racist pedophile.  But local leaders even go a step further, saying a crime was committed here.  They're now contacting the NYPD and federal authorities.  Obviously, that was the story from last night.  Starr got fired. 
[01:44:30]  This is why I hate the media, because they said that were allegedly broadcast and they had the recording.  Where's the alleged part, stupid asses?  You have it on tape.  And they were playing it during that actual newscast.  This is allegedly being heard by you as we're allegedly playing it.  We allegedly suck.  You wonder why there's gunfights outside Hot 97.  There's gunfights there.  They were evicted from the building.  I got to tell you something, though.  When you are called, because of what you broadcast, a racist pedophile, he beat us, Opie.  He beat us.  Exactly.  This beats anything we've ever done to get fired. 
[01:45:00]  My God, when there's city councilmen.  Did you see the press conference with the wife?  She's standing up at a podium, official podium, not outside of a doorway somewhere, with councilmen next to her crying, talking about how awful it is that this guy made threats against her daughter.  You are so gone.  You can't watch that, and then, like, he can't be at home, because we know how this works.  We've been in this situation.  You can't be at home going, maybe I'll skate this. 
[01:45:30]  Maybe this, you know, we could spin it in a fired.  So fired.  So fired.  Just fired and so fired.  He is so fired.  Completely fired.  E-Rock told me on his way in today that he was watching people just take the billboards down as fast as possible.  Well, they can't rip down his image with the call letters up fast enough.  Where was that, E-Rock?  On 10th Avenue going home yesterday, they were pulling it right down.  Yeah, they don't want no connection with this guy anymore.  That was a bad one. 
[01:46:00]  Although, I like him.  I don't know why I do, but I like him, because he just says awful stuff.  And I'm not saying they shouldn't fire him, but I don't like when the councilman get involved like it's a real thing that he said.  It's like, come on, you know.  But the thing, let me tell you something.  It was real enough.  It was, I didn't hear any humor in there.  We've said some horrific things on the air, and it's as dark comedy.  You know, some of the funniest stuff, my sense of humor especially, and Jimmy's, is horrid sometimes. 
[01:46:30]  Barbarism.  But there's a funny side to it, because it's so uncomfortable that there's humor to it.  But it has to be presented in a certain way.  His was presented as pure anger, and you didn't see it that way, Jim?  No, I'm not saying I didn't.  I just, I haven't heard enough of his stuff to know what his delivery.  Like, I've heard a little bit like there, but I thought I heard him.  And again, I'm not saying he should have been fired, because you've got to know better than to say that, because it's stupid on the air to say that.  Well, the kid thing will get you fired every time. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, the rules in radio have drastically changed.  Everyone knows that, especially in the last five years.  But even five years ago, if you're doing this type of thing on the radio, you're so out the door.  Like, they just will not tolerate the kid stuff.  My problem is not Clear Channel even saying that, because you know that's going to happen.  It was just stupid.  It's the councilman using it like it's a rallying cry of a real threat.  Right.  That's what I was, it was like when they said Eminem threatened the president and the thing.  It's like, you know, under the context of what is being done.  You don't think that was a real threat?  No.  No, what's he going to do to a kid?  No, I really don't.  I don't know, when you're offering 500 bucks for, you know, the location of the school and you're getting very graphic. 
[01:47:30]  That was nothing.  We could, you know, with the beeps and stuff, you needn't hear how graphic he got.  Well, I hate to say it.  With what he wants to do with, you know, the daughter of this woman.  Well, this is what I say today.  The unedited stuff will be heard on the second half of the Opie and Anthony show today.  We got all that stuff.  It was stupid, yes.  Fireable, yes.  I'm talking about the councilman getting involved like it was a real threat.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, I hate councilmen, too, by the way.  I'm not saying it wasn't stupid.  I'm just mad that he's now in the lead.  He's got fired.  He's been fired three times.  We've been fired, too.  What could we do?  You know, I think we need to.  Now we feel challenged.  We're up for the challenge, I got to tell you.  He's got the hat trick.  Well, I'm up for the challenge.  I mean, we can't have this guy in the lead with three firings.  He does have the hat trick.  Well, there's certain actors that went on Conan once saying about a senator or somebody,  I hope you and your family die, too. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  You remember that threat?  I don't want to bring up names.  Why don't you?  Because that would make it interesting.  We don't know who you're talking about, Rich.  Well, because I don't want to slander.  Who said it on Conan?  It's not a secret if he said it on Conan.  You know who it was, right?  He doesn't know who it was.  It was Alex Baldwin.  Who did he say it about?  That's who I don't know.  He said it.  I wish you would die in your family.  Did he say it about a senator?  He said it about Rich Voss.  Well, he might have said it about...  Maybe he was talking about Shelly from Glengarry Glen Ross.  The worst story I've ever heard. 
[01:49:00]  You need to do a radio show for dopes.  You know what a guy went on and said that thing?  I got a great concept for your show on XM.  A radio show for dopes.  Here's the thing.  I'm very intelligent.  I took an IQ test.  141.  You're not 141.  141.  There's a decimal point in there somewhere.  141.  It was one of those internet ones, right?  It doesn't matter.  IQ is not you.  Who cares?  It was an internet IQ test.  Where else do you take him?  He's an artist, too.  He drew Ziggy the Turtle on the back of a matchbook. 
[01:49:30]  I'm in Menster.  Rich, ask Joel Hollander if you're killing today for us.  He's the guy that can make it happen for you.  First of all, I do my part here.  When I come in, I set you guys up for some good stories.  I got another good story to come up.  I get laughs.  I know what I'm doing, okay?  How's it going, do you think?  All right.  Thank you.  Hey.  Oh, really?  He just took his headphones off.  Hold on.  I got my Jewish stuff right now.  Bye, everyone, Bond.  There you go.  He took out his Jewish stuff for Joel Hollander. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, and then he shows his tattoos.  You're not getting anywhere with the Jewish tattoos, Rich.  We told you that.  You are the worst.  You're against everything Jewish.  You have the Star of David tattooed on yourself.  You're not what kind of a – that is a contradiction.  The whole tattoo and Jew thing is – it's not –  You're not supposed to mark up your body.  If that's the case, then no Jew could be buried in a cemetery from all the facelifts,  the nose jobs, earrings.  Defacing your body in any way, you can't be – 
[01:50:30]  Jewish cemeteries would be empty, okay?  They'd be like my show in Allentown this weekend.  Yeah, man, okay.  Friday and Saturday.  Wisecrackers is going to be packed with –  Self-deprecating.  Wonderful.  Packed with laughers.  And Rich Voss will be doing the Starbucks comedy tour once again today.  Oh, that's right.  Meet us outside the building at 8.50 if you want to see Voss do some stand-up at another Starbucks, okay?  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We got the audio you were talking about, about the pedophile bringing his kid over.  Oh.  We got some audio.  We'll get to that.  And hopefully before the end of the show, David Lee Roth doing a country version of Jump. 
[01:51:00]  I want to hear that.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  And according to Joel Hollander, see?  Yeah.  I keep saying spreading across America.  We're going to be spreading to some other markets in the near future.  Stay tuned.  How long, Joel?  Near future.  Week?  Near future.  Two weeks?  Near future.  Don't push the man.  Yeah, a week.  Stop it.  Chicago, right?  Just give me a week.  Near future.  Chicago.  Cool.  Don't know. 
[01:51:30]  Don't speculate.  Don't put anyone in bad positions.  You know what you do?  You shut up and you go to spots.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio to the power of rock.  Sounds exciting.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  Damn, I love the conversations that go on in this place right before the mics go on.  No kidding.  I watch your fingers hitting the mic buttons and I'm going, oh my God, I hope he doesn't 
[01:52:00]  hit it while this is being said.  All right, we're almost done with the first half of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Tomorrow, the second half of the Opie and Anthony Show is going to be live from RCS  Experience on 56 and Madison.  Steve Schripp is in tomorrow.  All right, can you do that with me?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy's not going to be here.  He's doing his gig in Boston at the Orpium with David Tell.  Who do we got?  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr is stopping in tomorrow.  Bill the Potty Mouth Burr.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill. 
[01:52:30]  But the second half of the show, which is heard exclusively on XM, will be live from  RCS Experience, 56 and Madison.  We want to see some old faces we haven't talked to in a long time.  All right?  Your opportunity to stop by, say hi, and get some stuff as we broadcast live.  All right?  Right.  And as soon as we finish here, we're going to broadcast the Walk to XM live on XM.  And we're going to stop into another Starbucks.  And Rich Voss is going to continue his Starbucks comedy tour.  Can I mention one thing about the Starbucks comedy tour? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  If I do old material, I'm just doing it.  It's not the stuff I do in clubs.  You know, I might throw out I'm Dodginger or one of those old bits.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Just to get through this side.  We look forward to the I'm Dodginger joke.  It's actually funnier if you do that stuff because the fans are all familiar.  Can you do the dryer?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe.  I cried in front of Steve Chirippa.  He used to book the Riviera Comedy Club in Las Vegas.  And the weekend I was working there, my first wife was leaving me.  And, you know, I'm on the phone talking to her as another guy's helping her move out my furniture. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, God.  Do you know how depressing that is?  Oh, God.  Be a man.  Who, me?  Be a man.  I got tears.  What are you kidding me?  This guy's carrying out my furniture with my wife and kids.  Be a man.  And I'm working.  And I'm in Vegas.  And I already lost all the money I was making gambling.  I have nothing to look forward to.  It's like Thursday night.  I got three or four more nights there.  No money.  No wife.  No place.  Be a man.  Wow. 
[01:54:00]  A man would have thrown himself out of a window.  That's what a man would have done.  Steve Chirippa.  What's wrong?  That is sad.  Shut up.  What's wrong?  Well, he's got to ask.  Well, he'll be by tomorrow, so.  There you have it.  You're his headliner.  How do you think he felt?  I wasn't headlining then.  Oh.  That was years ago.  That was like 12 years ago.  Oh, this is before you.  I just started headlining two weeks ago.  What are you doing?  Oh, I thought this is not the first wife that I knew.  Yeah.  We got divorced 12 years ago.  No, you didn't.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Or 10, 11, 12 years ago.  You weren't headlining back then?  I was, but not in Vegas.  Who was headlining that weekend?  I remember.  I don't care.  Hey, listen.  Can you get a star for the second half of the O.P. and Anthony show?  Any way to get him on the horn?  Give him an invite to come over to XAM today.  I'm sure he wants to say something.  Yes, I'm talking to you.  You said you had his home number.  Oh, at home.  I said I have his home number at home.  Oh.  At home.  At home.  How many homes are in that sentence?  So why would you bring that to the conversation during the break?  I said I have a home boy's home number at home.  I got his home number at home.  Is Bonnie home? 
[01:55:00]  Is Bonnie home?  Yeah.  She's asleep.  And she can never find it in the drawer where I have all my numbers.  So why would you bring that to the conversation?  And you wouldn't want her rifling through your stuff?  Yeah.  What's that?  And you don't want her rifling through your stuff?  No, you want my furniture moved out again?  Yeah.  Do you want tears here?  It's between the two honchos you bought as a joke three weeks ago.  These guys, years ago I had a station wagon, and I don't know where they found them.  Him and Florentine put the gayest magazines in the back of my station wagon for my wife  and kids to find, right? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, man.  I saw them back there, and I wanted to keep them, but I couldn't keep them in front of  those guys.  He's such a creep.  A bunch of hard, me and Jimmy, one of all this hardcore gay porn just left it in his car.  And they're spread out to lovely centerfolds.  Oh, both unclipped, are they?  Let me tell you what this creep did, too.  We were at a wedding.  We were at a wedding.  I think it was Nancy Rhines, and I left my camera on the table.  So maybe a month or two months later, I'm looking at the pictures in front of my wife, 
[01:56:00]  and I see two male organs, and the sad thing is I recognized one that was his.  They took my camera in the bathroom and took pictures.  That's an old gag.  Yeah, you always do that when somebody leaves their camera hanging around.  By the way, that's funny.  Yeah, that's funny.  That's funny.  Not gay.  Not gay.  Who walked in?  Was it me and Jim?  I was doing that with somebody in a public bathroom, and one of us was taking a photo.  The other one was just leaning forward, hands on hips, pants down, and it was just a really, 
[01:56:30]  really graphic shot from the back.  And somebody walked into the bathroom and saw it and walked right back out.  And I don't remember if it was a wedding or if it was with each other.  You might have been with quarantine.  I don't know if it was a wedding.  Yeah.  Or just two guys hanged out.  Yeah, but we just had a photo shoot.  Just despicable.  Yeah, it's an old gag, but it's always funny.  Let's move on.  You brought the Dateline thing to the show today, Voss, about the Predator bringing his  kid.  We got the audio from last night's Predator special. 
[01:57:00]  Here's, so the setup, what?  The guy walks into the house.  Into the house.  Big, heavy guy with his, holding his kid's hand.  Holding his kid's hand.  Unbelievable.  After conducting four internet predator investigations in four different states, you'd think we'd  be prepared for anything.  Buzz room warrants.  He's getting out of the car.  But what happens here in Florida shocks us all.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  He brought his son with him.  He brought his son with him.  He's got his child with him. 
[01:57:30]  He's a 40-year-old married man, Clifford Wallach, screen name Photofix.  He's here to meet a boy who told him online he was 14.  Yikes.  But then again, if he leaves his kid home, he's an absentee dad.  This poor fellow can't win.  Leave him in the car with the windows rolled down a little.  He's in a quandary.  What do you do?  He doesn't know what to do.  It's hard to find good daycare in Florida, because there's a lot of patients in Cuba.  You're scared.  You don't want to just leave your kids.  When you're out molested, sometimes you have to take your kid. 
[01:58:00]  They were horrified.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God, no.  What's in the station wagon?  Oh, no.  That was a bad, bad move.  Yes.  Because then you think, like, what is going on at home?  Is this guy, like, you know, abusing his own kid?  It's just really sick.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  I'm coming in the back door.  Holding his son's hand, the 40-year-old walks into the house.  House.  What do you got?  Because we don't want to scare the little boy, we immediately tell the man what's going on. 
[01:58:30]  I've got to tell you something, and I'm going to tell you just straight up right now.  I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC.  Okay.  We're doing a story on adults meeting children, and since you have your child here, I'm not  going to pursue this.  Okay.  But I think you know what you were doing here, don't you?  Yeah.  No.  It's just too much to watch.  My point is, because your child is here, I think it'd be best if you just went ahead  and left. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, I agree.  I never even did this again.  So much for the hokey voice.  It got a little too real.  He couldn't use that.  But he's still had a little bit of it going.  We were surprised at what we saw next.  Didn't the guy just go, I won't do this again?  Yeah, he said, I won't do this again.  Oh, he thought he was getting away with it.  Yeah, he thought he was walking out, and he was going to go home and go, whew.  You know, as a man, aren't you obligated to just punch that guy in the face?  Right in front of his kid?  Daddy, why are we wearing it?  Like, why show restraint?  Yeah.  As a man, I think you are obligated to go, you know what? 
[01:59:30]  What, the reporter?  Yes.  No, we report the news.  We don't make the news.  Someone take the kid to a side room or out back, make up an excuse, and just punch the  guy in the face.  As a man, you're obligated to do that.  Well, don't do that in prison.  Yeah.  Huh?  Don't do that in prison.  I mean, you know, a pedophile, but to kill him.  How do you hold back, though?  You see the pedophile with his own kid in the house?  Yeah.  How do you hold back?  Eh, it's pretty bad.  Daddy, why are we wearing Halloween costumes in May? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, trick-or-treating.  We're just trick-or-treating.  Jeez.  You open your bag and there's...  Nope.  That's called a punch-out.  Yes.  Punch-out.  Punch-out.  How do you not beat him up?  Like the camera crew, at least.  I don't know.  First grade dialogue?  What?  I was trying to think of the word.  Dialogue was not it.  But he said, beat him up.  Beat him up.  How else do you say you beat him up?  How do you not punch him?  And Ope spoke like an adult.  I tried.  You spoke like a child.  Because we're talking about... 
[02:00:30]  You made me look really intelligent.  Yeah.  You walk up to him and say, I call you out.  Yeah.  Then you beat him up.  He crossed a line, you knock him out.  Give him a wedgie.  Yeah.  Since the police know the man has his son with him...  Sir, right there.  You come here.  You come here.  Let go of the child.  A female officer quickly takes the little boy  and whisks him away so he doesn't have to further witness his father's arrest.  Please give me my son, please.  He's taken away in handcuffs and brought to the transfer station. 
[02:01:00]  He's around for a son.  That's not an option for now, sir.  I didn't do nothing wrong.  I was only going to take some of the lunch.  I can't feel my hands.  Please.  Contact the boy's mother at work.  Tell her what's going on.  Hi.  Comes and gets him.  You want to get a drink?  Yeah.  Meanwhile, the dad is taken to jail.  Run in and make a left.  Photographed and put behind bars.  Oh, that's where he's going to get tuned up. 
[02:01:30]  Put behind bars.  You think if they do stay together as husband and wife,  which, I mean, I can't even imagine that happening.  Oh, they will.  She will hold that over his head for the littlest argument.  That wins every time.  It just, like, does it?  He can never, ever win an argument again.  I told you to put this away.  Sorry, I was busy not being arrested for pedophilia.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I wasn't bringing our young child to have sex with another. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, that's something I wasn't doing.  Perhaps you were thinking of it when you should have been mowing the lawn.  When I said no to threesomes, that means the whole family.  Let's go to Greg in Georgia.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, the funniest bit last night was where they were drilling the guy,  and he was sitting there eating the cookie.  Looked like little Timmy's daddy.  Finally got pissed, and he tossed the cookie, and he goes,  I don't want your stupid cookie anymore.  I was dying laughing.  Who said that? 
[02:02:30]  It was generic white guy was his screen name.  That's what he said online to the girl.  Do you have hair on your cookie?  Thanks a lot, guys.  We got a ton of audio from last night that we'll play on the second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, shit.  There you go.  That guy's voice.  I don't know whether I love him or want to just cave his head in with a rock.  He's so awful, you have to like him.  Smarmy, they call it.  He's smarmy.  You know what they call it if they're Bob Kelly?  Shmarmy.  Shmarmy.  Bob is such a stupid ass.  The guy's got a shmarmy attitude. 
[02:03:00]  Does he, word inventor?  I'm the dumb guy on the show.  Bobby's not the dumb guy.  I'm the dumb guy.  You two should really have your own show,  and it should be called Re and Tart in the Mornings.  Radio for dummies.  I got another great quick story.  If you want to hear a great story, quick one.  I say yes to the story.  That's just Ed checking in.  Hold on.  Let's listen.  Is it funny?  Yeah.  Two guys, they were playing golf in Newark, Wigwag Park.  There's a golf course. 
[02:03:30]  So they were gambling.  These two golfers were playing golf and they're gambling.  And one guy got mad at the other one.  And when his back was turned, took two of his irons and cracked them in the back of the head.  Broke his irons on them.  And the guy was taken off the golf course in an ambulance while the other guy was arrested.  That's a good story.  That's a good golf story.  Here's why.  It is actually a good story.  If it kind of just comes up organically in a golf conversation.  I know. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Where did that come from?  I was just thinking about the story.  And I thought you guys were done with Dateline.  I almost said we, but you guys were in the place.  And I thought you were done with Dateline.  So I'm going to throw out some more stuff than I read.  You know, I try to come prepared now.  Do you know gas in Venezuela is cheaper than water?  What is that got to do with golf?  Exactly.  You idiot.  Don't worry.  We got plenty of material.  I know.  But, you know, you're running late.  And this is the kind of stuff we're going to be hearing shortly at Starbucks. 
[02:04:30]  That's right.  Two guys are golfing.  One's a Jew.  One's a Catholic.  Go ahead.  Go.  The Starbucks comedy tour continues with Rich Voss in minutes.  Actually.  All right.  We'll play a little Van Halen today.  Well, David Lee Roth.  I want to hear this.  Last David Lee Roth was heard on these airwaves, he was the host of the morning show.  We now sit here.  And he has gone on to make country versions of Van Halen songs.  What is the album called?  Blech.  It's called Strummin' with the Devil. 
[02:05:00]  Strummin' with the Devil.  The southern side of Van Halen, a tribute featuring David Lee Roth.  How is it featuring David Lee Roth?  It's like, is he on every track?  Because I don't think the rest of the band approved this.  I think the band just said no to this project.  And David said, no, I got to do this.  I got to.  Strummin' with the Devil.  So he, uh, it's basically country Van Halen.  Such songs as, uh, Jamie's Crying, Unchained, Feel Your Love Tonight, Hot for Teacher, Jamie's Crying. 
[02:05:30]  Jamie is crying.  So why don't we get a little taste of David Lee Roth doing the country version of Jump.  This is like Hayseed Dixie.  Yeah.  Wait, no, Hayseed Dixie.  Dixie, right.  Hayseed Dixie.  I get up. 
[02:06:00]  Oh.  And nothing gets me down.  You got it tough.  Oh, I see the toughest around.  Oh, my God.  And I know, baby, just how you feel.  Dave's hair is rolling over in the shower drain.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Can't you see me sitting here?  I got my back against a ragging machine.  It's weird.  Oh, yeah, you're big.  Can't you see what I'm at?  Might as well jump.  Might as well jump.  Go ahead and jump.  Yeah, the shark. 
[02:07:00]  Might as well jump.  How?  Hey, you, who said that?  Baby, how you been?  You're saying, oh, no, I don't know until you begin.  Can't you see me sitting here?  I got my back against a ragging machine.  Okay, terrific.  I ain't the worst that you see.  Can't you see what I'm at? 
[02:07:30]  He should be on the Williamsburg Bridge with this going through his head.  Might as well jump.  Go ahead and jump.  Boring.  Maxwell, jump.  Turn it off.  Let it jump.  Jump.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[02:08:00]  Turn it off.  You know, when I used to blast Van Halen through them big, goofy headphones and just turn it up real loud and listen to it because it was just rocking.  Who knew?  Who knew?  You leave that to the goof bands.  You don't do it.  You don't do it.  You leave it to the goof bands. 
[02:08:30]  I actually wouldn't mind that song as a parody if done by another band.  Right.  Somebody else did it.  Right.  It would be like, wow, they countryed it up.  That's kind of fun in a weird way.  But you don't do it if it's you.  Right.  I like the little Stephen Lynch.  What?  Nothing.  No.  No, I didn't hear you.  We didn't hear that.  What happened?  I didn't hear you.  What did you say?  I was just talking.  I didn't hear you, Rich.  I was reading instant feedback.  What did you say?  Say it again, cancer. 
[02:09:00]  What'd you say?  Huh?  I thought I was a Stephen Lynch parody.  I didn't know it was Daily Raw.  I can't believe you've repeated this.  He actually said it.  Why would you repeat it?  Why would you repeat it?  Of course you would.  I'm like, he can't be this dumb.  He can't be this dumb.  Yes.  Yes, he is.  Don't say you were playing along.  No, I wasn't.  I bet I'm saying in the back of my mind, of course they heard it.  Why?  All right.  All right.  Listen, let's say hi to Carmen in New Jersey. 
[02:09:30]  Carmen, what's up?  Oh, my God.  What do you say, Carmen?  It sounds like a gay guy who just bought a pack of roaches.  Oh, okay.  It's horrible.  Jesus.  Jesus, why did we have to leave it on this one caller?  Yeah, that's our music.  Why do we have to leave our show with that call?  Can we get another one?  Ladies and gentlemen, Hugh Pinero is on his way over.  The CEO of XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:10:00]  Is he going to do the walk with us today?  Possibly?  Okay.  Well, we're out of here.  The first half of the Opinion Athlete Show is over.  Rich Voss, thank you so much for entertaining us today.  More gooder, more funner every day.  We're going to be downstairs in a few minutes.  We're going to do the walk over to XM to continue the show exclusively on XM.  Before that, though, we're going to go into a Starbucks and have Rich Voss do some more comedy as the Starbucks comedy tour continues.  See you Monday, most people.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy, have fun in Boston, man. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, you know what?  Tell them about tonight.  Tell them real quick.  Yeah, real fast, Jimmy.  Real fast.  It's sold out.  Oh, it's sold out.  No, give the plug for Boston.  Oh, Orpheum, Ticketmaster, tomorrow night was Jay Battelle and Keith Robinson, y'all.  Oh, I love this.  Dirk Diggler had more integrity in Boogie Nights.  The David Lee Ross song.  All right, they're telling us we've got to go.  All right, we've got to go.  All right, thanks for listening to the Opinion Athlete Show.  Thank you.  We'll see you tomorrow.  All right. 
[02:11:00]  It's like punch down, woman scream, Opinion Athlete.  That's right.  Opinion Anthony.  Opinion Anthony.  Mornings.  We're rolling.  Oh.  Down.  Down.  Outside the Free FM studio here in New York City. 
[02:11:30]  I'm waiting for more people.  Into the revolving door.  To do the revolving door bit.  Anthony's got a good bit.  Yeah, people go in the revolving door, and I have a microphone, and I look very official,  and there's a camera on me and everything, so when people go in the revolving door, I  do like a news tease about how dangerous revolving doors are, and people look at me all scared.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Revolving doors, the deadly danger.  We'll tell you about it at 10. 
[02:12:00]  Here we go.  Here we go.  Go to E-Roc.  Go to E-Roc.  Revolving doors, the idiot's coming out of it.  Revolving doors and E. coli.  Could it happen to you?  Oh, the looks you get.  The looks you get.  I love it.  We need more people to come in and out.  Yeah, what happens to all the people going to work?  She's laughing still.  Here's one.  Anyway, we're about to.  Very important story we're working on today. 
[02:12:30]  Avian flu virus linked to revolving doors.  Could it be a hidden danger?  Do you speak English?  I didn't think so.  Uh-oh.  Revolving doors, the hidden danger of avian flu?  No.  No?  Oh, she'll be afraid.  I'm not sure.  We're here today by an ordinary revolving door, but is there a deadly danger?  We'll tell you about it.  Okay.  She looks scared. 
[02:13:00]  Can I do one?  I have a news tease.  Okay, Jimmy, do one, please.  AIDS and a revolving door?  Here's one more.  One more.  Revolving door, the hidden deadly danger.  We'll tell you about it at 10.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  That's a great one.  She gave me that, get the fuck out of here look.  Oh, yeah.  We can curse again.  All right.  All right.  Let's start the walk today.  We got a nice showing considering it's awful in New York today. 
[02:13:30]  It is a nasty, another nasty day.  Hi, miss.  How are you today?  Derek, hit the sweeper, please.  Hit the sweeper.  We interrupted.  Who's that coming?  Anyone under one feet tall.  Yes.  Hi, sir.  What, a hat?  Could someone take, I know, I got, I'll get that.  Kenny, what is it?  Yeah, it's cool.  It's a hat.  It's a hat.  It's our team.  What is this?  It's our boat that we race on Wednesday nights, whip it out Wednesday, win on Wednesday in Atlanta 
[02:14:00]  Really?  Yacht Club.  And that is our team hat.  So I'd like you to have one, sir.  Why don't you come down to the yacht club when you're through?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Are you a big fan of the show?  Since 1998.  What do you like about the Opie and Anthony show?  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  Getting a little.  Koenig Ironworks.  Getting a little recognition from the people. 
[02:14:30]  Huh?  There's a lot of people here.  It's growing every day, but today the weather's crappy, so.  Actually, it's not bad, though.  We got about 20, 25 people following us.  Following us today.  Elo, you got to look up, too.  A lot of the businesses have noticed that we do this every day, and they start looking  down at us as well.  They should start making signs for you.  Yesterday, or two days ago, we had a sign for little Jimmy Norton.  We want a parade.  All right.  I still like the idea of the mariachi band, like, nowhere close to Cinco de Mayo. 
[02:15:00]  As soon as they sober up, maybe we can make that deal happen.  City buses.  Are they rolling death?  We'll tell you about it at 10.  Are you afraid, miss, to get on a city bus?  Avian flu spreading on city buses?  We'll let you know at 11.  Are you paying to kill yourself?  New York City buses.  We'll tell you about it. 
[02:15:30]  I think Anthony has lost his mind.  I love the reaction, because they kind of delay getting on the bus.  Like, what?  Am I going to get the flu?  The guy with his laundry, his dry cleaning.  Yeah.  Carrying dry cleaning down the street illegal?  We'll let you know.  He laughed at me.  Bastard.  Oh, my God.  Look at this guy.  A new homeless guy.  Oh, a new homeless guy.  He must have heard about the take is good.  Mac isn't there today. 
[02:16:00]  No Mac today.  Wow.  Sir, how do you feel about Star being fired?  You're an American.  I understand.  Wait, what are you saying, sir?  What are you saying?  Welcome to America.  Sir, where did things go wrong?  Sir, you want to talk to us on the radio about your plight? 
[02:16:30]  Nothing.  Wow, that guy's got an issue.  We're going this way today.  Why are we going this way?  We found another Starbucks.  It's the Rich Boss.  Starbucks comedy tour.  And now the homeless guy thinks we're falling.  Oh, the homeless guy's running away from us.  When the homeless run away from us.  He's got quite an outfit today.  Shitting in your pants in deadly danger.  The hidden danger in speed walking.  We'll tell you about it.  Guys are in their little walking suits. 
[02:17:00]  You should do an iPod one, too.  Oh, right.  Everyone's passing us with the iPods.  Yeah.  Where's this Starbucks?  Yeah.  We're not going to cut out?  You sure?  Well, you and I should probably stay close to the door just in case.  The door.  All right.  We're heading toward the Starbucks.  It's the Rich Boss Starbucks comedy tour.  It's starting to crackle a little.  I know.  Take my mic.  Bloss, you got to take my mic.  John Travolta haircuts coming back. 
[02:17:30]  We'll tell you about it at 11.  Jesus.  All right.  Hold on.  Here's your venue.  All right.  Hold on.  Here at your venue, Rich.  Club Soda Kenny has to make the announcement.  Make the announcement.  Hold on, Kenny.  Let people get in there.  Let's see if we can get in a little bit.  Some of the fans want to get in there to check out the comedy stylings of Rich Voss.  All right.  The listener is going in.  Make them believe they're getting coffee.  Yeah, they're cracking a little bit.  It's okay.  We'll stay close to it.  Oh, okay.  Not the mic's great.  All right.  Everybody ready?  Here goes Kenny with the intro. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  Let's get it.  I got to hear this.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage, your next comic performing in Allentown this  weekend.  Put your hands together for the comedy stylings of Mr. Rich Voss.  Let him hear it.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's good to be here.  A big hand for Kenny for bringing me up.  I'm working in Allentown.  I'm from New Jersey to Garden State, and our ex-governor planted all the flowers.  First, we had a gay governor, which was great, because he picks up all the rest areas. 
[02:18:30]  I'm rolling now, huh?  This is great.  This is the best Starbucks I've ever done.  Sir, turn around.  I'm on stage.  I'm sweating here.  Look at these two guys.  Now, what are you, a bottom or a top?  Huh?  What's your name, sir?  Let these guys in.  Come on.  It's a free show.  We got two brothers outside.  You can get in free.  I'm telling you.  Let him choke.  Listen, no.  It's for everybody.  Comedy.  How are you girls doing?  You from Hong Kong?  Where? 
[02:19:00]  Where are you from?  New York.  Guess again.  Okay.  A guy comes home from playing golf, and he punches his wife in the face.  She said, why'd you do that?  He said, I've been eating everything fat today.  A little golf joke.  A little goblin, folks.  Hold on.  Here, we got some more people coming in.  Sir, how you doing with the tie?  I like that haircut.  Did it come with a pocketbook?  Anyhow.  Oh, look at that hottie with the necklace.  Is that your girlfriend?  How you doing, ma'am?  Can I buy you a house? 
[02:19:30]  I'd love to chase you through the woods with a hammer.  Look how hard she is.  Hi.  She got a Louis Vuitton bag, but walks into coach.  Anyhow.  That's the back of the plane.  Hey, I got a car.  Oh, my God.  She is fine.  Anyhow, I'm back.  How you doing, ma'am?  You might recognize me from TV.  My career seems like it's plummeting, but I'd rather do a Starbucks than NBC any day.  Now, let me tell you this before I get out of here.  I got a way to solve the illegal immigration. 
[02:20:00]  We let all the Mexicans in.  They have to go into the military.  Then we invade Mexico, and we don't have an exit strategy.  But I have one now.  Thank you, and good day.  Rich Voss.  Let's give him a hand, ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss.  Let him hear it.  Thanks.  Do it.  Good night.  Rich killed.  He killed in a Starbucks.  I am beside myself.  Rich killed.  I love the Mexico joke you've finished with. 
[02:20:30]  Well, they were a good crowd.  The first Starbucks, they were a little uptight.  But I always like a 6th Avenue Starbucks.  Right.  Something about the Avenue.  The area is different.  Yeah, it's a better crowd.  Much better crowd.  Wow, Rich.  And we had a mixed crowd, although we did keep the blacks outside.  But it's okay, because we know they're not going to tip anyhow.  But it was a good crowd.  We had the Asian girls.  I had a good time.  Very, very impressive.  Rich Voss, everyone.  Act there by Rich Voss.  He went on a little long, too. 
[02:21:00]  You see, they turned on the heat lamp to let you know your time was up.  Nobody showed up.  It helped to have some fans in there, too.  That was very helpful.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Very good.  That was really, really good.  Which way are we going today?  This guy with the blue hat is irritating me.  Uh-oh.  No kidding.  We're going to cross the street now.  All right.  Let's give it a cross so we don't get hit by a New York City bus. 
[02:21:30]  No.  Hidden dangers.  Deadly dangers in child scooters.  We'll let you know at 11.  Miss, miss.  Do you trust these scooters on the streets of New York City with the hustle, bustle, and traffic?  Don't you think it could be a danger to your little tyke?  Oh, well, she's really, really careful, so I don't worry about that.  She's careful.  She's three years old, for the love of God. 
[02:22:00]  She's four and a half.  I can't tell.  I could say something really bad, but I won't.  No.  Very good.  Keep her safe and off that little scoot.  Buy her.  How old is that thing?  Get the kid a new toy.  Awful.  I thought she was two.  The woman said she was three, and all that went through my head were awful jokes.  Yeah.  Well, at least you didn't get a hard-on.  Jesus. 
[02:22:30]  You're terrible.  All right.  We're heading toward XM.  You dropped something.  His hair.  He looks like the guy that tortured Mel Gibson in the original Lethal Weapon.  All right.  Xiao Young bald.  Oh, we're on the home stretch, as they call it.  Yep.  The last half a block.  I may want a smoothie.  Someone ask this guy why he's wearing a cowboy hat in New York City. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, where is he from?  Where is he from?  Let her rip, Jimmy.  How are you, sir?  I'm Jim Norton with XM Satellite Radio.  We're trying to interview people about their hats.  No, not interested.  Thank you.  Oh, no.  We're just doing a story about people who are wearing, like, western outerwear in Manhattan.  Pardon?  We're doing a story about gentlemen who are wearing western outerwear in Manhattan, if there was a reason for it.  If there's a reason for it? 
[02:23:30]  No, I just like them.  You like the cowboy hat?  Right.  How do you find that women respond to that?  How do women respond to it?  Not particularly.  I mean, some like it, some don't.  Is it, like, a thing that's kind of catching on?  Because a lot of the women have said that they get tired of, like, the men in the expensive suits and kind of dressing like adults?  I have no idea.  From New York?  Are you from New York, sir?  Yes, I am.  Well, what part of the city? 
[02:24:00]  I live in Queens now.  Okay, see, you were shy to do the interview, but this is good.  We're doing a whole thing, and it's, like, about hidden dangers.  Hidden dangers?  Yeah, there's a whole thing where they were recalling cowboy hats, because they had some kind of a weird HIV tie-in.  Thank you.  It's chum for muggers, is what the cowboy hat in Manhattan is.  Yeah.  I loved you on that Dateline special.  There goes Jimmy. 
[02:24:30]  It is definitely mugger chum when you wear a cowboy hat.  iPods, hidden danger, and brain tumors.  And deafness, apparently.  I didn't hear a word I said.  We got a guy that just...  Pay phones.  Who's the cheapos still using them?  We'll tell you.  What's wrong with you?  Are you using a pay phone?  You're going to...  Oh, wait.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  My cell phone drops my calls all the time.  So, you got a cell phone, but you have to use one of the few pay phones. 
[02:25:00]  Does that one actually work?  I think so.  I'm going to try right now.  Tell her they found AIDS on a pay phone.  That Mr. Boston Blackberry Brandy isn't yours, is it?  Did you have to down a few before you made some of these calls?  No.  No.  No, I don't drink.  Oh, wait.  We're doing our lineup for our special report tonight.  Hold on.  This might be good.  And three, two, one.  AIDS from pay phones?  It's happening here in our city, people.  HIV right off the receiver. 
[02:25:30]  Not many people are using the pay phone, or it's also known as the homeless urinal.  What do you think that streaky stuff is down there?  Windex?  I don't think so.  Unless he could shoot it out his cock.  But I digress.  Thank you for participating in this nonsense.  Hey, Anthony, we got an 18-wheeler.  We're on Pal Talk right now. 
[02:26:00]  Don't call him good buddy.  Because, oh, Pal Talk camera's up.  Hey, how you doing?  My name's Walt.  Happy camper.  Happy camper.  How you been, man?  How you doing, everybody?  Look, I just wanted to walk up and say hi to everybody.  O&A.  Catch a Pal Talk live.  I put it on my dashboard and drive around New York City with this.  I've seen your pictures.  Yes.  And, Anthony, you have a problem driving that big truck?  Why don't you maneuver this around one time?  Come on.  No, you guys are what I call pain in the asses here in the city.  I can never get around you as quickly enough. 
[02:26:30]  Just drive over us.  I don't know how you do it.  God bless you, my friend.  What are you hauling, by the way?  Yeah, what's back there?  Bodies?  What do you got?  I got drugs on board.  Drugs?  There's narcotics all over the place.  I got drugs on board.  Long Island, vitamin capital of the country.  Oh, so you do have, where are you going?  And GNCs and stuff like that.  I got good stuff.  Yeah.  Walking by.  Oh.  Here, let's take a look.  Thank you, Happy Camper.  Well, now we're talking.  Hi.  Hi, girls.  Hi, girls.  Hi.  What is this, a high school or junior high? 
[02:27:00]  High school.  High school.  What high school?  High school.  Where?  I'm in high school.  Mayfield Secondary in Ontario.  Ontario?  Yeah.  Oh, well, Canada.  We have friends in Canada.  They're listening right now, as a matter of fact.  What's the age of consent in Canada?  16.  19.  16?  How old are you girls?  18.  Let's go.  We're going to the bar.  Come on upstairs.  All he is.  No, huh?  Goddamn chaperones. 
[02:27:30]  I'm going to smack all of them in the head.  They ruin it every time.  They certainly do.  Well, our Canadian friends, hello.  And God bless.  You know where, hey, there's some great restaurants way uptown, like 100 and something street.  You go up there.  Yeah, 168th Street.  Oh, those poor victims.  Yeah.  You're a lot darker than the other people, eh?  Eh? 
[02:28:00]  What a fun walk.  That was one of the better walks, right?  I walked.  I worked up a thirst for a smoothie.  Have Kenny get some smoothies.  Could you please get me a banana strawberry smoothie with some protein?  Of course.  Smoothies for everyone.  Low-fat milk, Ken.  Smoothies for everyone.  I'm out today.  Okay.  You love a smoothie?  I love a smoothie.  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, guys, thanks for walking with us today.  We appreciate it.  Thank you, people.  Bye.  See you tomorrow.  The second half of the Opie and Anthony show starts in minutes on XM. 
[02:28:30]  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  Where the fuck am I?  What the fuck is it?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  We played on TV screens.  Drawings.  They ran south and took off with a family car.  People making nasty comments about women.  Viruses spreading in our area to find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Watch the button. 
[02:29:00]  I'm me and Anthony.  I'm a black ninja.  Fuck face.  All right.  We remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dog on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  This is going to be some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  Indeed.  Oh.  With Opie.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole. 
[02:29:30]  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Good old man.  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rox.  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up. 
[02:30:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What am I saying?  Just saying.  Well, it's good to be back.  I'll be in Allentown this week doing a Starbucks.  Well, we're opening at a Starbucks.  And then we're doing Wisecrackers. 
[02:30:30]  If you have any calls, it's Radio 2 Recovery.  With Rich Ross today, we're talking about addictions, where they led you to, what your family had to deal with, where you're at now.  Anything you have on addiction, whether it be gambling, drugs, food, sex, whether you're in recovery, whether you want to get in, whether you're active.  We are going to take the calls, we are going to take the calls, and we are going to talk about, okay?  We have 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's the number.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[02:31:00]  And we're here today.  I'm filling in for a few minutes, that's all, to do the Rich Ross Radio 2 Recovery Show.  Okay.  Our first call.  Yeah, hi, my name is Frank.  I will do anything to get high, and I want to stop.  What should I do?  Well, here's what I think you have to do.  You have to surrender first.  You have to take the first step and admit you're powerless, and maybe check into a rehab, or just go to some types of meetings.  What was your bottom?  Oh, not this crap again. 
[02:31:30]  What's that?  You know, we just don't get in here quickly enough.  We're doing Radio 2 Recovery with Rich Ross.  Oh.  It's going pretty good.  We're taking calls on addiction, all kinds of Radio 2 Recovery calls.  People recovering from radio listening?  It was a great show I put on.  All right.  I thought it was funny.  Let's see if I can punch up the...  That was a really good walkover today, man.  That was fun today.  Rich killed.  I hope all of that made the air, because the mics were crapping out a little bit. 
[02:32:00]  But, man, you did kill in that Starbucks.  Who thought he could kill in a Starbucks?  He worked the crowd.  He had some good material.  I love the people making the coffee.  They don't know what to do.  They don't know what to do.  It's like, should I enjoy this or call the police?  Right.  There's no gray area in there.  It's like, is this good, or I'm going to be fired and everybody arrested?  The guys were standing outside the window.  That was a good...  You know what the sad thing is? 
[02:32:30]  I'm going to try to get booked there again.  But this time, I'm asking for more.  I want a large coffee.  That was fun with that hot girl that walked by.  Do you see how hot she was?  God.  All right.  Let's say hi to some people here.  Hey, Josh.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I just want to tell you that the walkover has become the best part of the show.  It's fucking hilarious.  Also, if Elo can get the Music Lab channel back on air, that would be great.  All right.  He's not here right now. 
[02:33:00]  He should be in here in a few minutes.  Let's go to Al in Queens.  Al, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I just want to say you guys should do a whole entire show, like, in the street one day.  Just walking the streets of New York.  Maybe one day when it's real nice, we'll take, well, at least more time to roam around.  Voss is sniffing his pits.  I just punched up his webcam.  I'm not even looking at him.  And the first thing I do is like, what awful movie am I watching?  Oh, shit.  It's Voss. 
[02:33:30]  Kramer in Tampa.  Kramer.  Hey, bubba boys.  Hey.  I was wondering if Rich's gay New Jersey governor cleaning up the restroom is going to be a standard stock opener at Starbucks.  Yeah, you opened with the same joke.  Oh, did I do that last time?  Yeah, you opened with that one last time.  Okay, I'm just trying to get through it.  But I did all the other new stuff.  Yeah, there's some good stuff in there.  I'm fighting with people over bits I did in Starbucks.  Your crowd work was very good this time around, too.  Oh, yeah, they were good.  I enjoyed it.  Fountaine or Fontaine or, I don't know, it's Michigan. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, boys.  What's up, Michigan?  I agree.  Rich Voss did kill in Starbucks.  However, he died horribly in the XM studios.  Instead of taking a call on addiction, he should have taken a fucking call on addiction.  Well, that was funny.  Ramon, get Rich at tongue alignment.  Tongue alignment.  Ramon, Rich Voss sounds like a shit salesman with a mouth full of sandals.  God damn.  That guy's funny. 
[02:34:30]  He had four good ones in a row.  Let's go to Tim in New York.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Tim.  I just wanted to let Jimmy know.  I feel like I'm pissing him off a little bit this morning.  There's a group, Iron Horse.  I don't know if it's the same group that did the Van Halen song, but they do all bluegrass  versions of Black Sabbath songs.  That's cool.  I like that, actually.  As well as Metallica.  You should listen to them.  Let me know what you think.  I've heard of them.  Any guys that do tributes like that, I think it's great.  Yeah.  Can we get a copy of that?  I would love to hear that.  Cool.  Punch it out, boys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Sally, a regular on the Opie and Anthony show from Chicago. 
[02:35:00]  Sally, what's up?  Hi.  Salve.  I'm thinking you should-  Did you fuck Vicky?  Excuse me?  A bunch of those Michael Flatley type dancers.  River dancers.  Yeah, which, you know what?  We haven't brought anything.  Well, we had Voss today, but-  Bye, Mr. Pinero.  CEO of XS.  There he is.  Stop by to say hi today.  You out too, Elo?  No, I'll come back.  All right.  We hit the Voss trifecta today.  I don't know who's asked to kiss today.  It's amazing.  Usually, it's so easy. 
[02:35:30]  You know which Voss you gotta, you know, kiss the ass of.  Usually, when things like this are happening, there's big deals going down.  Right.  But I think they're in town for a social event.  I actually laughed at Voss today.  What's that?  What, Sal?  I actually laughed at Voss today.  That next joke was funny.  What do you mean, actually?  Yeah, what do you mean by that, Sally?  Ben walked in.  When the Voss's, those two big wigs were leaving, just now, he looked at them, and Ben came running  into me, and I thought, like, something good was happening.  The Voss's might have said something about me.  And Ben goes, how do you like your coffee?  It is real. 
[02:36:00]  No respect today for Rod.  And how could they not respond to you when you throw around such terms like big wig?  The big wig.  Did I just say that?  Yes.  All right, Sally.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to Robert in Birmingham.  Hold on.  Rich wants to discuss the head muckety-mucks.  Hey, Robert.  What's up?  Yeah, I think that's a new low, even for Voss.  He just did a bringer show at a Starbucks.  You can't go on unless you have four muffins.  It's funny. 
[02:36:30]  This guy must be a comic because he knows what a bringer show is.  Yeah.  A two muffin minimum.  That's what I do.  Oh, so what was in...  Yeah, this is a good question.  Jason in Iowa.  Jason.  Yeah, I just wondered what happened yesterday after the show.  We didn't get to hear what was in their pants.  Oh, that's right.  Well, maybe she'll show today on Pal Talk and we'll let everyone know the answer.  That's right.  She actually did later on.  She wrote me on my MySpace account. 
[02:37:00]  MySpace slash Anthony Cumia.  C-U-M-I-A.  All one word.  Anthony Cumia.  How many friends do you have?  I have just about 20,000 something.  How do you get into Anthony's top eight again?  I've put just inanimate objects in there because people are just pains in the asses.  Are they really?  To be top eight.  So I just put like...  I have a clock.  Someone's a clock.  Eventually, he's going to put up his top eight bosses.  Top eight bosses, which we're getting very close to.  Top eight bosses. 
[02:37:30]  Tell you the truth.  We could probably do that.  What is that?  Is that on right now?  Yep.  Let me see it.  On our room?  Yep.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's the name?  The name is...  I can't even pronounce that.  Well, you better frigging pronounce it.  Holy moly.  Come on.  I'm missing it.  You're spilling it.  She's shaving.  What is going on?  Is this a video or is this live?  No, she's waving. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  There it is.  She's shaving her vagina.  She's shaving her pussy.  Can you hear us, miss?  If you can hear us, cut off one of your pussy lips.  Oh, you could smell it through the computer.  It's wonderful.  Look at her.  Oh, that's a nice lips.  Ugh.  Wow, she's pulsating.  Those are nice.  And she just decided to share shaving.  Wow.  That's very nice.  Why is she wearing a top, though?  A bra thing or something. 
[02:38:30]  Why don't you rip that off and just be naked while you shave?  Let's see the whole package.  Take that off.  Please.  Where is she doing it?  On an office chair with a towel?  There's going to be hairs all over the place.  She has a lovely veg.  Let her try to do that at Starbucks.  You like that one?  We got the dump sheet.  We got today's dump.  Oh, the dumps.  Let's play the jingle.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:39:00]  Wow, I got a major problem with one of them.  God damn it.  I knew it.  My first one.  My first dump.  Really?  Yeah, I knew it.  We only had three dumps today.  Right when I said it.  Three dumps and the show was very funny.  Well, I kind of thought this one wouldn't make it through.  Some overzealous caller at 7.37 a.m.  His quote, he said, listening on XM, not that free crap. 
[02:39:30]  Man, you can't dump that, man.  I got a real problem with that.  You can't dump that.  Why would you dump that?  They don't want their product being bad on their product.  No, I understand that, but it's just a caller saying something.  That's...  Yeah.  Jesus.  Jimmy, do you want me to drop that dump sheet on your chest?  Well, 8.43 was my first dump ever.  Damn it.  I said, I wasn't bringing my child to have sex with another child.  I knew that was going to get dumped, too.  I felt it.  Yeah, I felt it, too. 
[02:40:00]  Anthony, during child molestation discussion where a guy brought his kid with him to another  child's house.  I wasn't bringing my child to have sex with another child.  Well, and then 8.44, a mere minute later, Rich Voss asked the girl, do you have hair  on your cookie?  I knew that was getting dumped.  That's a joke.  You idiot.  I knew that was getting dumped.  It was a joke, but it wasn't in the context of the other joke with the barbershop set up.  Oh.  So it just, you know...  It's all good.  That's it today, though. 
[02:40:30]  That's not bad for me.  I like the free FM.  We had three dumps.  I don't like...  I feel now like I was undefeated, and now I have that one in the lost column.  What is she doing?  What is she doing, Hawk?  Is she taking a dump?  What is she...  Oh, all right.  Totally naked now.  There you go.  Can she hear us?  Yeah.  Where is she?  What state are you in?  No, I mean, yeah, a dress.  A dress.  She's got to shave the top now.  Wow, she went a while without shaving.  Yeah, since 1948.  She's got a lot of hair done. 
[02:41:00]  Get a weed whacker.  Thank you, Penny.  You're welcome.  Oh, I like this smoothie.  All right, let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's going on today?  What's going on, boys?  Hey, hello.  I got a funny story about Voss for you guys.  Okay.  Hey, Voss, do you know a girl named Jeanette?  Uh-oh.  No, we're from where?  Jersey.  It's four foot eleven.  No last names.  No.  Well, what did I do with this one?  Well, supposedly, she came to see one of your shows and went back to your house to hang  out, have a couple drinks, and you finally begged her to kiss you, and when she kissed 
[02:41:30]  you, you came in your pants.  No, that never happened.  I could see that happening, but that didn't happen in my house.  That was Jonathan.  Is that a true story?  He's gone.  Bradley, what's up?  Hey there.  I'm going to Vegas this weekend, and I was hoping to get a suggestion from Jimmy about the  ladies of the night, specifically the crappy $30 for your hotel room hookers.  I don't know.  Dude, Vegas is such a scam waiting to happen with that stuff.  I'm very careful in Vegas with whores, although if you have to, go on the computer, go to 
[02:42:00]  Eros Guide, and see what you can find up under Las Vegas, but I never trust Vegas, because  they're all like bait and switch and shit.  Or try to lose a few pounds and pick up a girl at the bar.  That'll work, too.  Yeah, thanks.  All right.  Thanks, Bradley.  Thanks.  All right.  We're going to take a break here.  She's still at it.  She really is.  There is a lot of hair she's shaving.  And then she kind of has like a paintbrush that she goes, and gets rid of the hair. 
[02:42:30]  She's got scissors, and she's got kind of a Batman logo going now.  And a body like the younger version of the lady in the tub in The Shining, she looks like  the younger lady who he thought he was hugging.  Not the one that turns into the...  How about this?  Put down the fucking clippers and pick up a razor and take care of that thing right.  We want total baldness.  I don't think she's going to do total baldness. 
[02:43:00]  No, she's not.  She's going to leave a design, and I'm going to hate it.  Yeah, it's going to be like a V thing.  Stop with the V thing, miss.  It's not Paul Stanley's guitar.  It's your cunt.  You shave that in any fashion you deem necessary there.  Boy haircut.  Boy haircut, lady.  Exactly.  Would you practice on your head?  Kenny, yes.  Elo ordered a smoothie, and he left.  Would you like it?  Yeah, let me have it.  Taking the boss's smoothie.  And he treated for the smoothies and breakfast, by the way. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, thank you, Elo.  Let me have Elo's smoothie, please.  Wasn't that awkward, Elo?  I actually want a smoothie.  It's from Elo personally?  Yeah, he paid for them, and your breakfast.  Wasn't Elo and Joel Hollander a little awkward?  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  But that's Elo's smoothie.  What are you doing?  Elo!  He left with Mr. Puro.  No, no, don't.  You are an ass. 
[02:44:00]  I thought you might have wanted that.  Now remodel the studio, like they did for us at CBS.  Wasn't the Joel, Elo thing in the same?  It was weird.  When we did that one break, we did a whole break with them standing right there in the studio  next to each other.  No one's going through my mind.  Mention XM, mention XM, mention XM, mention CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS.  Mention CBS, XM, CBS, XM, CBS.  Right.  Going back and forth.  And when Joel Hollander went in for the hug, I'm like, I can't hug him in front of Elo. 
[02:44:30]  Because I've been telling Elo that, you know, it's all about XM.  I don't hug Elo, but I hug Joel Hollander.  I don't know why.  You know what's going through my mind?  My name is Jim.  Not Ed Norton.  I'm Jim.  And he was trying to cover himself.  Who is the third man on the Opie and Anthony show?  I'm going to hug him up.  Ed Norton.  My name is Jim.  Ah, blueberries. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, blueberries.  Thank you.  My name is Jim, and I live on the second floor.  It was really strange.  Who cares from you?  I'm Jim.  Jim.  I'm not Ed.  You're Ed.  If he says you're Ed, you're Ed.  Yeah.  Is that guy really powerful?  Don't even answer him.  No, we just hug some guy with glasses.  No, I mean, for no reason.  It has nothing to do with the CBS radio division.  Nothing at all.  Except being the complete top boss of it.  In your words, Rich, he's the top cheese. 
[02:45:30]  He's the biggest wig there?  I say the head muckety-muck.  Right.  The big dog.  The honcho.  That's right.  The H-N-I-C.  She's done over there on Pal Talk, by the way.  Are you done?  Let's see it.  Let's see the final product.  See what that looks like.  Sure does, Nance.  Looks like a wallet, sir.  Miss?  She can't hear us.  Yes, she can.  I wouldn't bend over if I was you.  She saved her place in front of the world. 
[02:46:00]  I wouldn't bend over if I was you.  Don't you wish you had her uncle's email so you could thank him?  That's funny.  Going to use that at Starbucks next week?  By the way, how about Joel going on the air and saying that we're doing so well so far  that other stations in our future.  That's it.  He not only did, Opie, did you hear what he said?  Not really.  He guaranteed that we will be on more stations.  And he did actually. 
[02:46:30]  Guaranteed.  There were hints made.  There were...  We're failing perfectly.  There's a station in Anchorage which has expressed interest.  They need radio, too.  They certainly do.  Stephen P.A., what's up?  Hey, boys.  I just called to tell Jimmy needs to have a tender sentiment for being called Ed Norton today.  Yeah, I think so, too.  It might help.  You know?  When the big boss calls you by your wrong name.  I said hi to the boss and was like, you know, well, the boss just likes me.  And he...  The best is when you gave him a hug. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, he liked that?  Out of nowhere.  That was really funny.  We didn't get that on video, did we?  Because Joel Hollander hugged Ed and then hugged myself and then Jimmy's just...  We've never met Joel and I.  Right.  And Jimmy's just standing there really awkwardly and they're just kind of nodding at each  other and Jimmy aggressively goes in and hugs him.  It's really funny.  You want a tender sentiment today or you want to pass one on to you, Rob?  I think that I'm going to pass it.  I'm going to tell you why.  I was a little hurt, but I think Eric is very unsung on this radio program. 
[02:47:30]  I think that he gets a lot of, and forgive my language if they have to dump out of this,  malarkey.  Hey.  And I think that perhaps a tender sentiment from Iraq would straighten us all right out  and remind us of what it is we're here for.  Iraq.  All right.  If you will.  You don't shake the box, right?  You can't shake it like Jimmy.  No, here's the thing. 
[02:48:00]  He doesn't shake like Jimmy.  Watch the difference.  Jimmy, shake the box.  That sounds like a lot of new tender sentiments.  Are they adding tender sentiments to your box you've been adding?  No.  Of course not.  There it is.  Now, Iraq.  Now, Iraq.  Shake it like Jimmy.  No, that's not.  That sounds like Katharine Hepburn.  He can't even do that right.  Holding a box of Chinese checkers.  Oh, clickety-clack bitch.  All right, Iraq.  If you will.  A tender sentiment for you. 
[02:48:30]  You should have been aborted with a stick.  That is tender.  It is a sentiment.  And he tears it up into little pieces, but the memory remains.  All right, we've got to take a break.  All right.  We'll continue with what?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, we've got the star in Buck Wild stuff. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  We can play this over here.  Uncensored.  Uncensored next.  This is unpredictable radio.  Holy crap.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  Look at you.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm a grown man, and I'm being yelled at.  You're idiots.  Speak the truth. 
[02:49:30]  Come make your peace on my way.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I never knew.  But I believe that you're trusting me.  Oh, speak to me.  Speak the truth.  Come make your peace on my way.  And that's the newest Godsmack song on the Opie and Anthony experience virus with Rich 
[02:50:00]  Boston Studio Ops having yogurt and blueberries.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good job.  It's Whitmout Wednesday in six days.  Oh, I was going to say, it's Thursday.  Today's Thursday.  Norton, if you go to my website, you can see me introducing Godsmack at Woodstock in front  of 100,000 people.  So I go, and now recording artists present Godsmack, and they came out of crowd.  Did it remind you of introducing the who with the first one? 
[02:50:30]  If you go to my website, you can see pictures of me with all my Godsmack friends.  Yes.  Look ahead.  You introduce them.  I'll talk to them later.  I guess Sal, you're calling.  That's how he rolls.  That's how I roll.  That's how Jim rolls.  That's how I roll.  Well, hey, Sal.  Hey, Jim.  I almost got in a fight with a lead singer from Buck Sherry at Woodstock in the dressing  room.  Why?  I came into my dressing room.  It was a little thing in a trailer, and I lit up a cigarette.  He goes, do you mind? 
[02:51:00]  Of course you did.  He goes, do you mind?  I go, it's my dressing room.  Do you mind?  Get out.  I didn't know who he was.  Yeah.  And then I saw him on stage, and they killed, and I loved him, so I apologized.  And that's what he said?  Well, he stormed out, and he was screaming or whatever.  I didn't know who, you know.  What was he doing in your trailer?  It was one long trailer, and I had the little part with it, and they had the big part.  I guess he was warming up.  Right.  He's a singer.  He didn't want your filthy smoke in his throat before he sang in front of a tenth of a million  people.  Killed.  They killed. 
[02:51:30]  Right.  That's a good point, by the way.  The boss made it seem like it almost came to fisticuffs.  Yeah.  Had a fight with him in there.  I think the argument, he was a big argument.  Kicking ass.  What are you going to do, punch him in the knee?  Oh, Jesus.  He just does a great job for us today, and the abuse doesn't stop.  It doesn't matter.  No.  It doesn't matter.  I get my laughs.  I do my job, and I've got to get out of here.  Stop smoking.  That's all he said.  But I like when Opie attacks me as he's putting blueberries in yogurt.  That's real manly. 
[02:52:00]  Better than smoking for 30 years.  Oh, I'm rubbing your glue.  Listen.  Well, maybe better than smoking for 30 years, but the point about it being not masculine  is well taken.  He's absolutely right.  So is taking Midol.  That's also better than smoking for 30 years.  All right.  You're right.  It hurts.  And I knew you got me.  Well, guys, thank you for having me, too.  All right.  Go.  Jesus.  He's like, I got to go right when you guys get back on the air.  There we are. 
[02:52:30]  We've just been sitting here biding our time for you to leave so we can continue.  And I just wanted to say goodbye, you kvetching Jew.  Get home safe.  Godspeed.  Really?  Will you hurry up out of here so we can do the intelligent part of the show?  Okay.  We need the award music.  I thought you said that.  Are they cutting people off?  All right, guys.  I'm running.  Hey, you know what?  Thanks.  Give me.  I'll see you tonight at the benefit.  All right.  Good job.  You guys in Allentown.  See you, sweetie.  Maybe we'll set up some more Starbucks.  But I'd like to start doing diners because they're sitting down if we can set up some  diners. 
[02:53:00]  I got to run by.  Bye, Rich.  Your ass looks good.  There he goes.  Rich.  Ross.  Oh, jeez.  He turned.  No.  He turned around because he got fooled.  But then he wanted to make it seem like he was shutting the door.  He got fooled.  More bad acting.  I told you those White Shakes Incorporated clips of Ross acting.  Oh, horrid.  It could be the worst thing ever filmed.  He is a terrible actor. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, here we go.  Rich, Jimmy, what's your back?  I'm a terrible actor.  Are you crazy?  Did you see me do Lenny Bruce?  That's what Jimmy was saying.  Yes.  Yes.  I played Lenny Bruce perfectly.  You looked more like Lenny, Squiggy's friend.  That's from my bit, stupid.  I never heard that.  I went to get a Lenny Bruce CD.  I go to the guy.  Do you have any Lenny Bruce?  He pulls up his CD because I have Lenny Kravitz.  He's done that joke before.  I know.  He said he never heard it. 
[02:54:00]  I never did.  Going by a sofa, I probably blocked it out like a childhood rape.  Well, why did you bring me back in here?  Just to address the acting thing.  You're done.  Thank you very much.  You did a bang-up job.  It's always a pleasure.  You did.  I liked what he did over there with the Starbucks.  Dude, what the...  Reg, Reg.  Reg.  Just give that to whoever.  Oh.  Here.  Thanks.  Hey.  I got to go. 
[02:54:30]  The old slam.  Love the door slam.  Tired.  We got...  We have the David Lee Roth country thing still.  You want to hear another song?  You bet I do.  Opie.  What do you want to do?  Star in Buck Wild.  Yeah, let's do that.  No, let's do that.  If you ask for something else, I would just say yeah.  Because I'm all tuckered out.  It's been a crazy week.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:55:00]  I'm sleepy.  The story goes, Star, very popular DJ here in New York.  Got fired overnight.  We're doing some pretty saucy radio.  Right, Ant?  Saucy.  It's not so much saucy as you just can't say it on regular radio.  Yeah, I mean, the kid stuff will get you fired every time.  Yeah, it will get you fired every time.  And he was doing really well for them. 
[02:55:30]  I think he was syndicated in 11 cities or something like that.  Oops, yeah.  Clear Channel just said goodbye, and they're tearing down billboards as we speak.  Yeah.  Ripping down his image and name and station call letters off of these billboards.  Can't fire him fast enough.  Can't make it like he never existed for them quickly enough.  So he had a beef with another DJ?  What was that about?  A beef?  Who, you, Al Capone?  They call it a beef.  They call it a beef. 
[02:56:00]  Mass, eh?  You got a beef.  Yeah, a beef.  And with another DJ, right?  DJ Envy from 97.  From the other station.  97, yeah.  Where all the shootings happen.  Yep.  Right.  You got a beef with someone over there.  So to get at him, he mocks his wife and, like, puts out these little threats to his child.  You know who would have been good for this, too?  I didn't think of either.  It was Todd Lynn, because he worked at 97, was part of that Tsunami song, and he probably 
[02:56:30]  knows Star.  And the consulman, or whatever, what's his name, John Liu?  Yeah, the Asian guy?  The Asian guy, like, wasn't too happy with DJ Envy when the Tsunami song went down.  Nope.  He was part of that whole Tsunami song debacle, I believe.  But he was able to keep his job for some reason, and now he's helping him out against  Star.  Well, his wife is part Asian, I think.  Yeah.  Um, and I gotta say one, and as much as I don't like to see the guy get fired, even 
[02:57:00]  though what he did was really dumb, at least the Asians, like, because black people are  very rarely, when it comes to, like, language content like that, called racists.  Very rarely, because, again, it's just that white guilt thing.  But it's cool to see the Asian community doesn't want to hear that shit, and they're out very  vocal about it.  I mean, if a white DJ did it, they'd be complaining.  And now that black DJs have been doing it, they're bitching too late.  I'd love to see that.  Yeah, black DJs can really get away with knocking whitey, too.  Yep.  Whitey and Jews.  Yeah.  They, uh, they can get on and just say, like, heinous things about, you know, the man 
[02:57:30]  and, uh, and, uh, what we've done, and, you know, a cracker, crack-ass cracker.  I don't like that type of talk.  I don't like that crack-ass cracker.  White devil.  I heard that, like, uh, on WLIB years ago.  They used to call us the white devil.  That was the name of the show.  And, uh, but, uh, no one ever called him out on it, but the Asians now kind of get in a  power base where, uh, you know, you say something bad about them.  Oof.  Yeah, they don't want to hear it.  No.  Yeah, the Asians have organized. 
[02:58:00]  They don't mess with the, they don't, you can't mess with them anymore.  And, uh...  They're very organized.  He said some pretty nasty things.  What was he saying?  Lo-main eater.  Yeah, what was it?  One derogatory term.  We got all the audio from the show that got him fired.  Huh?  Not on the show.  Oh, okay.  Uh, we got all the audio from the show that got him fired, so he had a beef with DJ Envy  and he, uh, just started going off on his program.  It got really personal.  Absolutely.  Here's the first clip.  Hey, did somebody holler at me and tell me about his whore wife and his kid?  I like when a faggot-ass nigga sticks his head up. 
[02:58:30]  DJ Benji.  This faggot-ass nigga used to try and literally lick my scrotum to be down with me.  Now he's talking slick.  How about he get at me about his whore?  His whore wife and his kid.  This little ugly-ass kid I hear.  Where does this kid go to school?  I got 500 bucks for that information.  Somebody email me or give me a call.  Just tell me where this kid goes to school.  Let's see who's really gully on a microphone.  $500 in my pocket right now.  I need to know the school.  This faggot-ass nigga DJ's kid goes to school. 
[02:59:00]  I hear he can't even control his bitch.  Jesus Christ.  Man, fired, so fired.  How do you get away with that?  Well, that one wasn't.  That one was borderline.  That's just the beginning.  Because he hadn't.  Right.  That's just the beginning.  I like listening to that guy, though.  I would actually listen to that morning show every morning.  No, you wouldn't.  I would.  We're doing a radio show.  I don't mean if I was a part of the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie, I'm speculating.  I want to use faggot-ass nigga a lot.  I do.  Just not when the radio mics are on. 
[02:59:30]  It sounded cool when he was singing it.  And he meant it.  He certainly did.  I don't want to be called a faggot-ass nigga.  Not me.  I'm Jimmy Kins.  His wife, Ed, Katz used to allegedly run trains on her.  She used to drive a green BMW, a 325 series.  Tim, Katz ran trains on her, bitch.  And you still married her.  You're a hell of a man.  I thought it was.  Like a train sound effect.  It's kind of funny.  Hey, look who's on CNN. 
[03:00:00]  Ed Norton.  Ed Norton.  There I am.  It's Edward Norton.  I like the fact that he threw in the word allegedly because he was being radio savvy.  Meanwhile, there's no dump button, and he's saying, I want to skeet on your child's face.  Yeah, he didn't want to get in trouble by saying she pulled trains.  So he goes, she allegedly pulled trains, you know, lest I get in trouble for this.  Lick my scrotum, four-year-old.  Lick my scrotum is a violation right there.  Yeah, you can't say that.  How do those dummies at Clear Channel not enforce a dump button in New York? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  How do you not make a guy with a dump button be on your radio station?  When all that, if I now calm down, I might use a word here, all that hullabaloo that took place years ago with the FCC and these commissions and the radio stations and Congress,  and all them, especially Clear Channel, came forward and said, look, we are putting safety in place that will keep these things from happening. 
[03:01:00]  And then we find out this guy had a dump button that only he had access to.  What the hell is that on broadcast radio?  You need somebody protecting what they call the license.  The good old license.  The old license.  The old license.  Wow.  So it gets even better here.  That's information.  The school that this kid goes to.  Really?  Yeah, I'm saving that one.  That's the one I'm going to pull out if I have to. 
[03:01:30]  If I have to.  Oh, yes, I'll come for your kids.  Yeah.  I will come for your kids.  And I finally got the information on his slant-eyed whore wife.  A cat who actually ran a train on her contacted me.  Allegedly ran a train on her once upon a time.  Allegedly once upon a time.  Yeah.  Ejaculated all over her face half an hour before DJ Benji picked her up.  It's the Star on Buckwild Show.  Nigga, don't move. 
[03:02:00]  I'm not.  I'm staying still right now.  I'm petrified.  Right.  I certainly am.  Nigga, don't move.  Nigga, don't move.  We ain't moving.  You let us know when we can move.  He says allegedly, and then right after that, ejaculates on her face.  Which you can't say on regular radio anymore.  You can't say that on regular radio.  You cannot say that.  Holy mother of pearl.  What is he thinking?  Well, this is where it gets just over the top.  Oh, really?  It gets over the top? 
[03:02:30]  Well, we're nowhere near the top right here.  Wow.  You think somebody during the break would have said, um, maybe you don't want to continue  with this.  Uh, why don't you go on to sports?  You would think someone.  What about American Idol?  What happened?  You'd think someone would have just found the plug and just pulled it.  Pull the plug.  Cut the power.  Just.  Do something.  Find the station chainsaw.  Save this.  Save this man.  Just start destroying electronics.  Yeah, just with an axe into the electrical equipment.  Until the show goes off the air. 
[03:03:00]  Start hacking away at electronic equipment.  Everyone was asleep at their desks.  Whew.  His slant-eye whore wife.  Wow.  That is.  You know, this type of brawl has to end in gunfire.  This guy's, the, the, the husband here, the guy that he's got the beef with, that he's  mocking the wife and the kid, what is he going to do?  Nothing.  He's, but, but he's obviously got to shoot the guy. 
[03:03:30]  That's how the, it's settled in the urban, uh, little disrespect going on.  Yeah, there's some major disrespect going on.  A little bit.  It's been known at these stations, you know, gunfire has, has happened and, and rappers  are very, uh, into shooting each other when there's a problem.  You know, we haven't even really talked about it for the rest of the country.  New York understands.  This hot 97 in New York is just a mess.  People are getting shot all the time.  And they made a new rule that entourage. 
[03:04:00]  No posse.  No posses are allowed in the station when the rappers come in for the interviews.  There's a no posse rule.  If you're a rapper or something, you've got a posse of 25 people.  They used to all come up and, and now, no posse allowed.  A lot of buck, buck.  A lot of buck, buck.  A lot of, uh, pistols being held sideways outside of that station and being shot, uh,  What was the famous shooting?  Little Kim?  Yeah, Little Kim.  Little Kim was involved.  She's going to jail.  And there was, uh, there was one.  She's in jail, yeah.  In jail now.  And there was one a couple weeks ago. 
[03:04:30]  What was the guy's name again?  Because they said he had no comment.  Oh, Gravy.  Motherfucking Gravy.  Mr. Gravy had no comment.  Yeah, yeah.  The paper reported.  It was something, yeah.  Someone got shot and, and, and the news actually said, there was no comment from Mr. Gravy.  Like, they just call him Motherfucking Gravy.  He's just, Grady.  Grady.  Hey, Fred, I saw someone.  He spilled avocado on his jacket.  Oh, that Grady.  I saw who shot the gun. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, shit.  You saw who shot the gun?  It was a nigger.  A nigger?  A nigger rapper.  Your son is trying to influence certain things that happen at this radio station.  I will give $5,000 to whoever tells me where little Danny goes to school. 
[03:05:30]  My mommy said I'm not supposed to touch your scrotum.  Oops.  Wow.  Yeah, but Hot 97's a mess.  And I hear it's like a regular office.  Like, regular guys and gals just want to make a living.  Yeah, they're a station in an office building, so.  And they don't know when the next shooting's going to occur.  And Emmett's just fighting it going, they're discriminatory against us.  It's like, you're shooting people!  There are people being shot. 
[03:06:00]  This isn't loud music.  This isn't the occasional stripper, you know, dressed scantily, walking into an elevator.  You know, this is people being shot.  All right, let's say hi to Nelson in the Bronx.  Nelson, what's up?  Nothing much, man.  Hey, I was just going to say that this guy had so much power over there at 105.  That's why he's the only one who had the dump button.  He had a guaranteed contract.  He basically did whatever he wanted to do.  But this goes way above him.  Clear Channel has 1,200 stations. 
[03:06:30]  They're not going to incur the wrath of the FCC for one guy.  No one is that big.  If they booted Howard off stations, they'll take this guy off stations.  There is no such thing as a guaranteed contract, sir.  No matter how much power or ratings you have, you are vulnerable to be pulled off the air if you say something to the extent he...  Without a doubt.  But they wanted the New York market so bad.  That's why they hired him back.  It's just a bad move to not have a dump button.  How do you not... 
[03:07:00]  When you're Clear Channel, how do you not have a dump button?  Because he'd have probably shot the dump guy.  You know, oh, I had to dump out of this, Star.  I'm sorry.  You know, buck buck.  He shot the dump guy.  You have it be somebody...  Hold on, dude.  Hold on.  You have it be somebody outside the studio dumping it.  If you're afraid of your own talent.  All right.  Hey, what did you say there, Nelson?  Give him his own show after Ron and Fez.  Oh, Star? 
[03:07:30]  Well, we're trying to get him on the show.  We'll see if he can talk.  He probably won't come on, man, because of the money.  By the way, Ron and Fez are just killing...  Their take on the David Blaine thing had me in stitches.  I know.  Had me in stitches.  What'd they do?  Just their take on it was just fantastic.  They ran with it.  You know, and then all these people were calling with inside info, and they were just mocking  that it was inside info from the sphere, and you had to listen to it.  They just did a brilliant job with the whole David Blaine thing. 
[03:08:00]  Well, you know what it is, too, and I wish I had this kind of discipline.  It's Ronnie's commitment to coming in early to prep for the show.  Does he?  Like, we come in, what, an hour before showtime, usually?  We try.  And go through everything.  Just not enough for Ronnie.  Ronnie is here.  You know, I'll wave to him right now.  It's hours before his show is going to start.  Ronnie!  He's right there.  Look at him.  Yeah, and look, he doesn't even want to look up from his research and paper.  The guy is here hours. 
[03:08:30]  The commitment to the program that he has is like I've never seen.  Or is he smoking a cigar at 12 o'clock outside the building?  One at the other.  You want to know what a dumb piece of shit I am?  When you said he comes in early, I went, does he?  Meanwhile, I've seen him walking in his overcoat at noon.  I don't know how he does it.  He comes in after his show starts.  The best one was the other day we leave the building.  The day we did like six hours and we went almost to noon.  And we're outside and Ronnie's holding court, smoking a cigar.  Yeah, we're all yapping, talking. 
[03:09:00]  It's after 12.  Talking to, you know, the employees.  Yeah, you know, I go up whenever I want.  It'll be handled up there by Fez.  And the guy is consistently funny.  They have on Wackbag, they have Ron Bennington's line of the day.  And you read through the shit and you could hear Ron saying these things.  And it makes me laugh just reading what he says about certain things.  One of the funniest guys on radio. 
[03:09:30]  Which one of his lines?  Do you remember any of his lines?  No, you just read them.  They could be a throwaway.  But it's just the way Ronnie says it with the sarcasm or just the way he'll tell someone to shut up and they won't even know that he's telling them to shut up.  He just got away with the words.  All right, back to the, uh, back to the star audio.  So here's where it just gets ridiculous.  Is she back up under the table there?  Come on now. 
[03:10:00]  Get up from there, little girl.  Your daddy, DJ Benji, he's busy right now.  And he's got to come see me.  He's got to.  This is how OGs get down, folks.  You may not understand this.  But real niggas know what I'm talking about.  When you come for a person's kid, that person has to come see you.  Now, the countdown starts today, nigga.  The countdown starts today.  Damn summer scam.  This is bigger than that.  I have come for your seed.  Remember the one I want to do the little R. Kelly on? 
[03:10:30]  Tinkle on her?  Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.  Folks, this is very inside.  Just give me a second here.  I'm talking to DJ Benji's woman because he's not man enough.  She's got to tell him when he gets home that 42-year-old man disrespected our seed, boo.  You've got to go see him now.  Got to.  You can't lie and pretend you were in the parking lot or across the street no more.  You have to do it this time for real, for real.  There is a whole thing going on.  There is a whole culture that I just don't fit into.  I don't understand.  I don't understand the language, the logic. 
[03:11:00]  There is something going on in the black community about respect and calling people out and doing things that I, as a white man in this country, don't fucking understand.  It's childlike barbarism.  Yeah.  There you go.  It's childlike barbarism.  Beautifully put.  That's exactly what it is.  It's fucking – and I'm not saying – when's the last time in rock guys shot each other?  When's the last time – it just doesn't happen. 
[03:11:30]  But in rap – and I know the guys from the streets, there's always real violence associated with it.  Even that – I mean as much as this show is trash, Stern is trash, this show, or Man Cow or whatever, there's never been like a real thing like we're going to come get your kids.  We'd like you to stop by for – I mean except for that douchebag Pharrell and Bubba trying it.  But even that was half-hearted nonsense.  Yeah, nothing.  Even that was I'll kick your ass little man nonsense.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is – that shit right there is come with a gun. 
[03:12:00]  Someone is going to die in this exchange if you come see me.  You got to go visit him, boo.  You got – like there are rules in place after you're disrespected that you have to adhere to.  And that means going to visit the guy and having some type of gunfight or something because the guy – the guy mentioned that he has a nine.  Nine, right.  That he's got a gun.  So there – this – is this supposed to end in someone's death?  Is this a duel? 
[03:12:30]  Has the duel gone into the black community?  Is this the verbal slapping of the glove on the cheek?  Because I don't – I don't get it.  It's un-fucking-civilized.  Next, let's say hi to Mark in Philly.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yo, I'm driving down the road and I'm watching them tear down Star and Buck Wild billboards as we speak.  Yeah, Clear Channel can't – I can't even think right now.  You're saying they can't distance themselves from him fast enough?  Fast enough, thank you, yes. 
[03:13:00]  They're trying to erase the memory of Star as fast as possible.  That's unbelievable.  In this climate and the way things are, I mean, I'm amazed, like, we're over there at CBS only for a week or so, but it's like – it's weird to see.  It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be with stuff getting dumped.  They let a lot more stuff go through.  But when you're up there talking about, like, I'm going to tinkle on your kid, it's like, dude, just as a smart guy, why would you think that's going to, like, not get you in deep shit on terrestrial?  Right.  Right.  Jeez, man.  Unbelievable. 
[03:13:30]  Let's say hi to Greg in Jersey.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  I was wondering, now that Star's not working, perhaps he could work with the grief man now.  I don't think he'll be apologizing.  Yeah, there's no apologizing.  No, I bet you he will.  Apologizing.  I bet you he will.  Guaranteed he will.  Yeah, what's going to happen now?  He'll apologize.  If he apologizes, he's going to look like a pussy, and they can't do that in the black community.  The guy will lose all credibility.  He called this guy out.  How is he going to apologize?  I'll tell you how.  I'm not talking to you.  What he was saying was about the guy's kid. 
[03:14:00]  When you're threatening a four-year-old like that, it only makes you look stupid.  All DJ Envy has to do is come out and go, he's threatening my kid.  There's no way for you to look good doing that in a black community or any community.  So he has got to come out and go, look, it was stupid.  It was a radio bit.  I would never hurt him.  Oh, he's not going to do that.  I guarantee you he will.  He's so not going to do that.  His whole thing is about street cred.  I don't think that would hurt a street cred for saying it.  It would absolutely hurt it.  I disagree.  Because it wasn't like he threatened – if he threatened him or just – I'm sorry. 
[03:14:30]  He did.  That was a threat to him.  But I'm saying if he said like me and you are going to meet up, I'm not saying he's apologizing for that threat.  He's going to apologize for what he said about the kid.  Like, look, that was out of order.  I was out of line.  I don't think so.  Okay.  And him with the kid and the wife was a direct threat to the guy.  That is so far beyond a threat to the guy.  You could say, you know, hey, come down here, man.  I'm going to kick your ass.  I have a problem with you.  I'm going to kick your ass.  That guy was – that threat was way beyond that. 
[03:15:00]  Threatening the wife and the kid to get to the guy is a threat.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why you won't lose street cred because what you threatened were such weak targets.  You don't look – you don't keep your street cred as far as I'm concerned.  Or what do I know?  I'm fucking going to North Brunswick.  But you don't keep street credibility in the black community.  By running away and yelling, leave him alone.  But you don't keep – in any community, you don't keep street credibility by threatening a four-year-old.  You know what I mean?  There's a way to apologize for that and not lose it if that's what you're worried about. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  I'd like to see it.  Yeah.  I think he's in a tough position.  He's in a really tough position.  No one's going to hire him anytime soon.  I don't know who ends up hiring him eventually.  He will apologize.  Maybe satellite radio.  You never know.  You never know down the road.  But I see the street cred that Ann's talking about.  No, I know what you mean.  I think he might not have a choice.  So he's going to – I don't know.  How does he spin it?  If he said –  How does he spin it, Jimmy?  I was stupid.  What I said was, Adeline, it's somebody's kid.  You should never mess with that. 
[03:16:00]  You rarely see the rappers apologizing.  You're right.  There was one.  Which beef was it?  It was 50 Cent and who?  And they actually had to come out and say, look –  Oh, the black guy.  Yeah, the game.  Oh.  Again, what a literal idiot I am today.  I'm too tired.  The game.  Yeah.  But they buried their beef.  The difference is two men doing that.  That's literally the only time that has ever happened in the rap community.  Black people with black humor.  Black people are pretty liberal with humor. 
[03:16:30]  You can get away with a lot.  But the things they don't really go for are religious jokes they don't like, unless you're  doing it in a parody of religion, but just really shitting on religion they don't like  and pedophile stuff.  They don't fuck with kid jokes.  No.  Is Ben still working today?  No.  We're here at XM.  Well –  We should get Patrice on the air.  Absolutely.  Great idea.  Let's get Patrice.  Because he –  Let's say hi to Sean in D.C.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, y'all?  Hey, man.  Listen, man.  I'm a black man. 
[03:17:00]  I just want to give my take on this.  I think that regardless of what's going on here, that dude is seriously, seriously out  of line.  And I think that in the black community, a lot of times, we try to make ourselves look  a certain way and say, you know, I'm doing this.  I need street cred.  I need this.  I'm going to call this person out.  It's just ridiculous, man.  A lot of the stuff that we do to ourselves, I think is very, very offensive.  And as a black man, I'm offended by what he said and what he did.  And if he doesn't come out and apologize, that just shows just how stupid he is. 
[03:17:30]  Street cred or not, what he did was totally, totally out of line.  Just way out of line.  But you know what I mean?  I got to tell you.  I'm starting to see it Jimmy's way a little bit, too, because I'm starting to see this  through, the whole street cred and stuff.  But it's kind of like the prison thing with kids.  Like, everyone has kids, so you're like, yo, you know, by not apologizing, you're going  to piss off all the other people.  But then what's he going to do?  Apologize and then say, but, you know, I still want to kick this guy's ass.  It won't even get to that point.  I still want to shoot him.  No, it won't even get to that.  You're a black guy.  You know what I'm talking about? 
[03:18:00]  You're not keeping street credibility in the black community by, like, threatening someone's  four-year-old.  This is stupid, man.  I mean, street cred or not, man, it's just, like you said, Jimmy, it's uncivilized, man.  Why we just can't show a little bit more civility towards one another?  Yeah.  If this was a problem that he had with this guy, why not take him to the side, man, you  know, pull him up as a man and talk to him?  Why does he have to go on the radio in front of everybody to make us look more uncivilized?  This is the reason why people think black people are uncivilized as it is.  You know, just keep the stereotype going, man. 
[03:18:30]  Right.  It's ridiculous.  Does anybody know what the problem was between these two?  Because nothing's been written about that.  I mean, what did this other guy do that has the star so pissed off?  Um, he cut him in line at, um...  At Great Adventure?  Oh, yeah.  No, at a Starbucks.  Oh, at a Starbucks?  Oh, wow.  It was a weird thing.  They were both at Starbucks.  I thought he said that he was a failure.  Uh, no?  No, no.  Did he threaten to go on terrestrial radio?  Hey, Sean, thank you so much for your angle, because, uh... 
[03:19:00]  Thanks, man.  I don't know.  We don't really...  Listen, also, man, I just want to say, Jim, the comment this morning you made about the  black bear being shot because you reached for his wallet, I was quiet all the way to work.  Thank you, man.  Glad somebody caught that.  Thanks, man.  All right, thanks, honey.  There you go, Sean in DC.  Jeff in Alabama.  What's up, guys?  The other side of the spectrum.  Here we go.  Let's go, Alabama.  Yeah, I think I agree with Ann about what he was saying about how he just doesn't understand  that whole mentality.  Yeah.  And what I think a part of it is is that whole Scarface image that they're trying to portray. 
[03:19:30]  That whole community, a lot of the rap community is so obsessed with the whole Scarface  movie and the gangster image.  Gangster image.  They're trying to live that life and that whole respect aspect that they've got going  on.  If he had goofed on the guy's kid or just made fun of the kid, be it whatever, that's  something I wouldn't see him apologizing for.  But when it got to the level it got to, it's like he's got to come out and apologize, and  I think he will.  Yeah.  All right.  Yes, of course. 
[03:20:00]  Let's get Bronx Johnny in here.  He knows the beef.  Lamont from New York.  Lamont.  Yeah, how you guys doing?  Hi.  Listen, this guy, he's a very good radio host, I mean, for the most part.  What he did was a huge faux pas.  Bringing the guy's kid into it was totally unnecessary.  And I mean, to me, I think he'll be back on radio, hopefully satellite.  I wanted to mention this on the FM show, but I didn't get a chance to.  But, you know, it's really what's called the negatism of, you know, always trying to sound 
[03:20:30]  tough and all that.  I think he went over the line, and I think even after he said it, the second it came out  of his mouth, he knew it was wrong.  Well, he went back to it.  The thing, the problem is, like, just, because he sounded like, you know, he's obviously a  funny dude, but to, like, do that on terrestrial when you know the rules.  I mean, the FCC is the same for white stations, black stations.  I mean, it's the same set of rules in place for everybody.  And, like, there's certain things he said, like, ejaculate on the face.  The FCC would crucify anybody for that.  You can't say that.  You know, that's something he should know better with, because, like, he's been around 
[03:21:00]  a long enough, man.  All right, let's say hi to Bronx Johnny.  He's in the studio.  Hi, Johnny.  Morning, fellas.  Also known as Jay, who's been the victim of Bobby's no homo game.  I listened to that replay, and he was like, I got a fat, I'm Spanish, so my ass is fat,  but that's probably why he pinches it.  I got quite a laugh out of that.  No, because he's a homo.  What do you got, Bronx Johnny?  Yeah, what's going on?  Well, no, basically, the beef, it really wasn't between them until Star started getting  at them for the Summer Jam for Hot 97's promotion, so that's where it started, like, 
[03:21:30]  getting out of hand.  Like, how did it, what was the problem between those two?  Well, it didn't get, it got out of hand, because he mentioned something about, like,  how the weekend show sucks, and I guess he took it as it taking a shot at him, because  he does weekend radio for Hot 97.  All right, gotcha.  But you went after a weekend guy?  Yeah.  DJ Envy's not even on full-time?  No, he used to be, but not anymore.  He does weekends.  Weekend guy.  Wow.  Why would you go after the weekend guy?  Poor guy's just trying to make a living and get back into the full-time radio.  He's scratching a wage.  You could trash him every day, and he can't trash you until Saturday? 
[03:22:00]  That stinks.  No kidding.  You know, five days to steward it?  If I could change the subject for a while, there's this board op in Cincinnati that I  really want to fucking jump on.  He's an asshole.  Nothing?  I thought that would get kind of a laugh.  I'll tell you why, dude.  A board op?  I'll tell you why, dude.  That's so low in the radio, um, why, Jimmy?  It is, but it's not an on-air guy, and we were never on a Cincinnati terrestrial.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I'm not saying, I'm not saying a battle, uh, with-  We got to buy in.  All right.  We got to buy in a little. 
[03:22:30]  This would have worked a little bit better.  Okay.  Uh, give me a-  The guy who does overnights in Buffalo might have worked a little bit better.  No, I wanted to go so far off of day parts that it's not even, he's a board op.  Oh.  That was the funny part.  Was allegedly-  That he was a board op.  Allegedly, yeah.  Yo, man, Jimmy.  I just want to R. Kelly that joke.  I just want to tinkle, tinkle, tinkle on it.  Let's say hi to Todd Lynn.  Hey, what's happening, man?  Hey, Todd.  Todd, what's happening?  What's going on?  Now, Todd Lynn, of course, worked at, uh, which, which state? 
[03:23:00]  I don't even know.  Hot 97.  Hot 97.  Hot 97.  Got fired because of the Tsunami song.  Yep, that was me.  So, you know about, uh, this type of thing, obviously.  Yeah, man.  You know what?  I'll be honest with you.  I feel like Starr was pushing the envelope because he was making a lot of money, but he wasn't getting  the ratings that Clear Channel thought he was going to get.  I really believe that.  I believe that he was really trying to push the envelope because he was not getting the  ratings.  And y'all know as I know, it's all about the ratings and the money. 
[03:23:30]  You know, and I don't think, I think he reacted.  And like anything, just like me on the radio, I think he reacted.  He didn't think about what he was about to say.  He was so caught up in the beef of it.  Like, I'm going to make a beef so I can try to stretch out these ratings.  I mean, he wasn't winning in the 18 and 34.  And he was barely winning, you know, overall.  So he was trying to, you know, spread the point out and he couldn't do it.  Yeah.  But do they sit these people down with lawyers and go over what you can and can't say on 
[03:24:00]  the radio?  I'm going to be very honest with you.  When I was at Hot 97, no one said anything about what you couldn't say.  Really?  In fact, the first time I heard, they were blatantly using the word nigger on the air.  And the first thing that came to my mind was, we can do that.  You know, and nobody ever said anything.  And, you know, so you start taking, you start saying things just to keep up.  I mean, man, y'all been in the situation. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they push you, the radio stations go, do it, do it, do it, do it.  But if your ass get caught out there, you're on your own.  But, Todd, how do they not, this is what I don't get either, and I know you were at  97, but how do they not have a dump guy?  How do you not have a guy on the button just in case a fuck flies out?  You do have a dump guy for a fuck, but you don't have a dump guy for the lead person.  When you're the lead person, I can say this from working at Hot 97, when you're the lead  host, you have carte blanche over what you said.  There's nobody in there checking you. 
[03:25:00]  There's nobody going, what you can say.  And I'm pretty sure with the way he ran his show, that nobody from his producer, Miguel,  to anybody else was sitting there going, you know, they weren't censoring him at any.  See, at CBS, we got, I mean, Ope or Ant, I mean, who really run the show.  They can be overridden by Al Dukes, the dump guy.  Like, if he sees, they'll tell us what was dumped.  They have a guy down the hall, which is, A, irritating at times, but, B, it does kind 
[03:25:30]  of, like, save you from a lot of trouble at times.  Man, have you heard that dude's, have you heard that dude's show?  He runs his show with full autonomy.  He doesn't care about what he, I know he, he probably had it stipulated that he doesn't  have a dump button.  He wasn't going to dump one of those rants that he made.  He wasn't dumping that.  That was a complete rant.  I heard the entire thing, but he had been building up to it for about a week.  Yeah, DJ Envy, by the way, is a full-timer on the morning show. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, he's a full-timer.  And then he does the weekend thing on his own again.  Oh, it's a separate thing he does.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, he's a full-timer on the morning show.  He was there when I was there.  What kind of guy, what kind of guy is he?  DJ Envy?  Yeah.  Actually, you know, on several occasions, DJ Envy tried to get me fired when I was up  there.  I mean, he's not a very talented DJ.  He's just, you know, he's basically on the morning show.  The show carries him.  He doesn't carry the show.  Do you know Star?  Yeah, I know him.  And how is he? 
[03:26:30]  Is that who he is off air, or is that just kind of like...  Star is a bright, intelligent, well-thought, well-spoken guy who I believe, and just in my  opinion, gets caught up in his bullshit.  Okay.  It's just that simple.  I mean, and he got caught up in it.  I'm pretty sure, just like you know, those execs were sitting him down saying, hey, we  pay you $17 million.  There ain't no way, you know, we should be further along in the game than this.  And he was trying to strip up the program through the bullshit, oh, let's have a beef. 
[03:27:00]  You know, let's have a beef theory.  And he tried to beef with Envy, and he went too far.  I mean, Envy wasn't buying into it.  All right.  You know, Envy wasn't buying into it.  I mean, Envy just let it lay, and let it lay, and let it lay, until finally, you know, he  said something.  I mean, the R. Kelly comment was totally off base.  But even before then, he was teetering with a lot of stuff that he shouldn't have been.  I mean, on the regular airways. 
[03:27:30]  Not stuff you can get away with a satellite, but he was tripping, man.  Y'all know it.  I mean, y'all talking about it, but you know what the radio stations do.  They push you and push you, you know.  Yeah, they want you to do it.  They push you.  And then when you do, they say, well, see you later.  Yeah, they say, well, here's the one.  See you later.  We'll hire you in four years.  So they still got to fork over $17 million to that guy.  Right on.  All right, Todd.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thank you so much.  All right, dude.  No problem. 
[03:28:00]  See you later.  Todd Lynn, everybody.  All right.  We got the next track.  Anything else there, Bronx Johnny?  I kind of disagreed a little with what Jimmy said about the FCC, because I listen to Spanish  radio in the morning.  With Jimmy?  Yeah.  You're not going to violate them or anything.  No.  You're not going to start a beef here, are you?  I don't want any beef.  No.  Like, Spanish radio gets away with a lot of stuff on terrestrial, though.  Because no one understands it.  Because the FCC doesn't speak Spanish.  But the rules are the same, though.  Like, I think part of the problem with what Todd started to say is Clear Channel probably 
[03:28:30]  didn't pay enough attention.  They didn't think people were listening, what they're saying on the black stations.  They're out of touch.  They probably didn't think that as many people are going to pay attention to what they said  on those stations.  I would like to know, maybe somebody can look this up in the research department.  How many FCC violations have been made to black personalities?  I understand the percentage of black personalities to white personalities are probably less.  But in a major market like this, like New York City, I think, you know, it's probably 
[03:29:00]  more so, more even than anywhere else.  L.A. also.  How many against black jocks as opposed to white jocks?  And the Spanish, even if the complaints probably haven't come in, the rules are the same.  Like, you know, you ejaculate on the face.  It's, if brought to the attention of the FCC, it's going to cause a problem.  Ejaculate on El Faso.  Yes.  If you say that, there's going to be a problem. 
[03:29:30]  It's a problem with any station.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  They need to settle it like we do in the white community and just challenge them to the octagon,  brother.  Yeah, brother.  Bring it on, brother.  You and me in an octagon.  A man's man will sell tickets and give all the money raised to charity.  That's what we do when we have a...  And I can't do it when you...  And he can't be there when you challenge him.  All right. 
[03:30:00]  Thank you, Dave.  Hey, we got two more tracks here from this show that's becoming very famous now.  Yes, I come for kids, folks.  I only know one way to fight, and that's dirty.  Oof.  There she is right now.  Get from up under that table, little girl.  Come on, now.  How much...  Oh, she's burping.  She's burping the joy juice.  Oh, my God.  That's disgusting. 
[03:30:30]  Come on.  Come on, now.  You see, you can't try to go there with me, player.  You used to shake when I saw you.  You can't even look me in the face.  Now you're talking grimy?  You're talking grimy?  Oh, boy.  That's the second get-off-under-the-table reference, too.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  A little kid under the console there.  She burped up the joy juice?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Unbelievable.  Oh, boy.  So fired.  So completely fired. 
[03:31:00]  We should be fired for talking about it.  For even thinking about it.  For...  Well...  Yeah, this is so bad, we're a little scared that we're discussing it.  My goodness.  He's so fired.  Well, this next clip says it all.  Here you go.  DJ Benji, did you hear me when I said I want to put mayonnaise in the ass crack of your baby  girl and take a bite?  Hello.  Just in case you didn't hear that.  The Opian Anthony program has decided to go home early today. 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  And look at Eric getting hungry for the mayonnaise.  Yeah.  Eric's like, oh, that sounds pretty good.  Wow.  A lot of mayo.  Okay.  Terrific.  DJ Benji.  All right.  Enough of that.  So there you have it.  Wow.  The GM's over there must be a little nervous.  The executives at Clear Channel. 
[03:32:00]  Right.  That guy sounds like a loose cannon.  As a matter of fact, I heard rumor that he did injure one of them.  And we have audio of the executive.  What happened?  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  And here's the original fight between the two that started the whole thing.  All right.  Drop it.  Or I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town. 
[03:32:30]  See?  Now maybe he had a right to what he was saying.  Yeah.  All right.  Seeing if there's anything else he might have said.  Of course.  And then he had a problem thinking that it had nothing to do with what he said.  Yeah.  You don't want to hire any niggas.  That's all.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm trying to just be funny, but it scared me.  Right away, he's getting fucking fresh.  Getting fucking fresh.  Where is that clip? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  It's here somewhere.  I don't know.  Did someone give me the...  I bet you they did.  Let me see.  Anthony.  You got it.  Fantastic.  We got exclusive audio of the general manager sitting Star down behind closed doors, Ant.  Ooh.  Oh, good.  Let's hear that.  You're a red kid, Tatcha.  Wow.  He was just joking, wasn't he?  Oh, no.  This is horrible.  What?  What happened?  Well, apparently, Star did get to the guy's wife, and we have audio of what happened. 
[03:33:30]  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  That's horrible.  You shouldn't do that.  Never.  To, uh...  Yeah.  I'm breaking your balls on you.  Right away, you're getting fucking fish.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[03:34:00]  Right away, you're getting fucking fish.  Right away.  I'm breaking your balls on you.  Right away, you're getting fucking fish.  Getting fucking fish.  Please, I want the other one, too.  Hey, someone...  Henry, someone's got to teach this fucking kid...  She teaches kids some fucking manners.  Some fucking manners.  You know, you guys always go too far.  Oh, well...  Shut up.  That's where you need the hole and she didn't chime in.  And then, uh...  The wife got mad at the husband for not backing her up.  Keep out of it!  You don't know how I feel! 
[03:34:30]  Now, guys...  Like a bad actress?  Let's not make fun of people.  Shut up.  This has nothing to do with anything, but it's funny.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  You would think it was the real people.  He does these impersonations.  I don't get it.  Janice Rossi is all four.  I don't get it.  That wasn't Janice Rossi.  No, I know.  That was, uh...  Yeah, that was Janice Rossi, wasn't it?  That was the one that Pesci was dating. 
[03:35:00]  Janice Rossi was the one Henry was dating.  Hendry was dating.  Hendry.  Are you sure that wasn't Janice Rossi?  Oh, it's all right.  I'll make sure I'm not kissing that King Cole over here.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  I think you're right and I'm wrong.  So I think that the other girl then said,  I see how a white girl could fall for him.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, I think I'm wrong.  It wasn't Janice Rossi.  It wasn't, uh, the girl that...  Pesci's girlfriend.  Oh, I was right.  Okay, I was right.  Pesci, are you sure?  Absolutely.  Thanks a lot, Bear.  You're welcome.  Huh?  Uh, Sam?  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him. 
[03:35:30]  See, that's a different girl.  Listen.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  You're right.  And then this was Janice Rossi.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Thanks for nothing, shit dick.  I will bet $100 that...  That's Janice Rossi.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I bet $25.  One dog goes one way,  and the other dog goes the other way.  And this guy's saying,  what do you want from me?  Anthony, I don't think you really mean that.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  I'm breaking your balls,  and right away you're getting fucking fresh.  Stop it.  Oh, come on.  Right away you're getting fucking fresh.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.  Guys, I can't take this.  Oh, gosh.  I gotta say you gotta stop.  Hey, someone's gotta teach this kid  some fucking madness, Henry.  Yeah, we need that one.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  Love it.  You know, you sound just like my ex-husbands.  Yes.  I'm with you now. 
[03:36:30]  Why don't we take a break?  Thank you, Johnny.  Thanks, Josh.  Bronx, Johnny.  Take a break.  I'm breaking your balls,  and right away you're getting fucking fish.  Now, guys, let's not make fun of people.  Fucking fresh.  Fresh is something like an eight-year-old gets  when he's not eating dinner.  Not a hired murderer.  And the beauty is that, like,  he goes, teach this kid some fucking manners.  Fucking manners.  Some fucking manners.  Teach this kid.  Guy's fucking 40 with a Glock.  He's yelling at him. 
[03:37:00]  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  It's all right.  We're my party.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Anthony?  Yep.  Yeah.  Yep.  One more call before break.  Go, Anthony.  What's up?  Anthony?  Go.  You're on the air.  All right.  I just wanted to call Jimmy a hypocrite.  Why?  He sits there and rips on the guy  that he's talking about the kid and everything,  but then he'll talk about a little Conor Peterson.  No, no, no.  We're doing it.  Let me correct you.  I didn't.  What I said the guy was stupid for doing his,  A, doing that on the air.  The difference, 
[03:37:30]  and I even said if he made fun of the guy's kid,  the difference between doing something in humor  and doing it to for real go to guy into coming for you  is different.  And you hear the way, like, say Stern in this show,  and they were playing all that audio of Emily Stern,  but no one actually was saying,  yeah, we're going to fuck your daughter.  You understand what I mean?  It didn't get real.  I'm not saying you can't make,  you're not a hypocrite.  I'm telling you,  because my point of view on that hasn't changed.  Hypocritical, what, dark humor about the Peterson situation 
[03:38:00]  and Scott and the wife and the news  and the way the news covered it  and sick humor about it  is the same as making threats to a guy  and pulling in the wife and kids  and being serious about it?  And also, dude, making jokes about it.  You don't get the show.  Stop listening.  You don't get the show.  You don't understand the show.  You're wrong, dude.  No, I do understand.  No, you don't.  The mayonnaise on a kid's butt and biting his ass,  that's stupid, so yeah.  It is, but on terrestrial, dude,  on terrestrial, you can't say that. 
[03:38:30]  You're going to get dumped.  And saying you want to ejaculate on the kid's face,  that's an FCC violation.  It's just stupid.  I'm not being hypocritical.  I didn't say he's morally repugnant.  He was just stupid for doing it.  I'm the one this morning that was saying  that he was kidding.  It was fireable because of what he did,  and I was the one saying that the fucking councilmen  were full of shit for saying that he was a pedophile  because he's not.  He was saying it in humor.  I even said that.  So how am I a hypocrite?  I missed that part then.  Okay.  I apologize, Jim. 
[03:39:00]  You're still a prick.  Oh, God.  You stink.  I'm just trying to explain.  Right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  All right.  Let's stop breaking your balls,  and you're right away,  you're getting fucking fresh.  Yeah, Anthony.  Go home and get your fucking shine box.  Yeah, somebody teach this screen  us some fucking manners, Henry.  All right.  Let's think it rules.  Let's step aside and take a little break.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Freddy Rodriguez.  Hey, this is Dane Cook.  Hey, folks.  My name is Henry Rollins.  Hey, this is Anna Faris.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent. 
[03:39:30]  I play Phil Leotato.  Hey, this is Kevin Smith.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss,  and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  So be it.  Tread no more.  Just to secure pieces  to prepare for more.  So be it.  Settle the score.  Touch me again with the words  that you will hear evermore.  Don't tread on me.  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Don't tread on me.  This remix sucks.  La la la la.  Don't tread on me.  La la la la la.  Unless you want to.  La la la la.  Don't tread on me.  I swear you would think it was the real people.  Oh, I feel like I'm kissing Fan King Cole over here. 
[03:40:30]  Don't try to love me.  La, la, la, la, la.  Don't try to love me.  La, la, la, la, la.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah, yeah, that's good.  That's good.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  Quiet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Quiet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what you do when you're a punch drunk.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Don't try it out, man.  Quiet.  Quiet. 
[03:41:00]  Let's say hi to Steve in West Palm Beach.  Steve, what's going on?  You dick.  We wouldn't waste that kind of time from 6 to 9.  That's right.  Oh, I want Ben in here, by the way.  I want to get Betty Black a question for Ben.  All right, we got two more things before we get out of here.  First, it's Steve in West Palm Beach.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, ONA?  What's up, little muffin?  Hello.  Hey, I just got to tell you guys.  You guys got a billboard going up down here in West Palm.  I'm down here right now.  You're watching our billboard go up in West Palm Beach.  Ben, are they putting up billboards soon?  Yeah, they're all, well, I know that some of the markets are ahead of the others. 
[03:41:30]  So I have a conference call with all our PDs.  Which picture are we using?  The one that you approved?  Oh, boy.  That one that's all over?  Yes.  On everything?  That one that's doing that thing?  Doing the thing.  All right.  I know that, I also know that, like, certain stations will have their WOW stickers in a  couple days, some of them.  Next week, I'll have the info on the left side.  But you're watching the billboard go up.  Can you take pictures for the website?  Yeah, I got my camera phone.  They got the left side done as you look at it? 
[03:42:00]  I have the left side for me.  I'm just sitting there now on a roll somewhere.  You're in the back of a truck.  I'm in a roll on the back of a truck.  All rolled up.  Get me up there, bastards.  Hey, and I've been listening to you guys for a while.  I got a question for Opie and Ant.  What?  Right?  With, like, all the power talk chicks and everything that's going on with, like, girls  and everything, does your guys' women, like, ever get jealous or talk to you?  Nah.  I mean, you know, Opie's got Lindsay and Ant's got the housekeeper.  I didn't know if they got pissed off. 
[03:42:30]  Don't get a housekeeper.  You know, they silly goose.  They deal, you know.  Pussing out, guys.  We don't do anything.  We look on, it's not like we're big A.  We just window shop.  Well, you know.  Yeah, it's okay.  Oh, boy.  Hey, uh.  I have a question for our producer.  What?  What?  It's not a bad question.  What?  After the show yesterday, Ben got annoyed at me.  Oh, about the money thing?  Yeah, so I wanted to know what it was about because he's like, don't talk about the money thing. 
[03:43:00]  What was it?  At the end of the show, we said, let's get out of here.  We got to go.  Oh, my God.  And Ben.  Poor Ben didn't get it.  Well, no, no, no, no.  It's been a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr.  Grr.  Steve still does it.  No, but it wasn't just that.  It's just been lately.  He's been saying the money thing.  Oh, I'm just, it's irritated several people.  Who?  Oh, here?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But who?  You said people.  I've had comments.  Poor people, Jimmy.  Oh, fuck them.  Ben said to me, he's like, don't do the money stuff because it's bothering, like, some of the fans and people in the company. 
[03:43:30]  And I'm like, all right.  People in the companies, people in staff, people, you know.  Don't you.  Well, who on staff?  Yeah, come on, point.  The wrong pieces of shit.  Who on staff?  I don't know.  I just thought it sounded stupid.  Because if it's Derek, he's making more than anybody in that room.  All right.  So you didn't like it.  Oh, you didn't tell him that?  No, but you didn't.  Oh, you didn't tell the others, Derek?  It's a fan.  But who in the company? 
[03:44:00]  I want to know who.  It doesn't matter who.  It does matter.  It's not a secret.  He's wearing his young body at night just to make ends meet.  And even when he doesn't need money.  Yeah.  Just because it's viable.  You got to have a hobby.  You certainly do.  Hey, why don't we go to the phones?  Thanks, Ben.  But I want the teacher to make your gig producer of the show.  I don't like that one.  It's Ben.  Yeah, I like this one.  It's Ben.  Hurricane Ben.  Durr.  Durr.  Durr.  Durr.  Durr.  Durr.  Durr.  Durr.  And let me point out one thing.  Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben. 
[03:44:30]  If anybody, and I mean anybody,  is getting annoyed at the jokes I do about counting the money and this or Demone.  Right.  Eat my asshole.  I'm not going to stop doing them.  Because here's the deal with the money.  I don't even know the exact figure of money.  I honestly don't.  Yeah.  They didn't tell me.  I got an idea.  I mean, they said, like, this is what the money is going to be split three ways.  I mean, that was just kind of what I got the idea of.  But to anyone that got mad, I don't know how much money I'm making from the CBS thing. 
[03:45:00]  I really don't.  I've not been told.  I'm sure it'll work out.  Can I be completely honest?  I'd prefer you weren't.  None of us have seen extra money yet.  Yeah.  No.  I don't even know what it's going to be.  It's not what people think.  The whole deal was thrown together last minute.  Absolutely.  We still haven't even gotten extra money yet.  I'll be lucky if I take $8 million out of it, Ope.  There's fortune and glory.  And at this point, we're in it for the glory.  So that was kind of a sarcastic joke.  Ben doesn't get the whole sarcastic. 
[03:45:30]  We've been doing it for so long.  And if anybody, like, gets offended by us joking about money things, I just bought a house, for God's sake.  I just bought a house.  I wasn't able to afford one earlier.  We make jokes about it because it's funny because it's such sarcasm.  You were able to afford a house.  You weren't able to afford a mansion yet.  And finally, you've been able to afford a mansion with a three-car garage.  It's two.  And it was also a sarcastic statement about anybody who thinks that we sold out for money. 
[03:46:00]  You guys do it for money.  So we make fun of that and address it.  But that's where it came from.  And the fact that we even have to.  Ben.  Gotcha, to my mind.  The bullet bounces off that big skull.  He goes, what happened?  Peter in New York, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  First, just wanted to let you know how much fun I had this morning on the walkover.  A lot of laughs.  Voss really killed over there at Starbucks.  Yeah.  Cool, yeah.  Yeah, thanks for joining us today.  It was great.  Secondly, just wanted to let you a little bit of Goodfellas trivia. 
[03:46:30]  When Bats is in the bar, he's telling them, you're over here getting fresh.  And he turns to the other guy who's going to reach for his gun.  Do you guys know who that guy is?  Yeah, it was one of his cronies.  No, but in real life who he is.  I do know, but tell them.  That's Vito Picone from Vito and the Elegant, popular singing group in the 50s.  I didn't know that.  Just a little bit of change for you.  Just one more thing, if I can add, that you guys were just talking about.  How about one thing? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, it's the third thing.  Yeah, you're just trying to bust my balls.  I'm getting fucking fresh.  Come on.  Show it right away because you're getting fucking fresh with me over here.  Come on.  Anthony, listen, I just wanted to let you know, I love, I don't know about the other fans,  but I love hearing about how much money you have and how you spend it.  You're more of a people guy than that fucking Springsteen ever was.  I'm a working class Joe.  Attaboy, Ant.  Attaboy.  That's what I am.  Keep that angle.  Rick's a richest guy, a real working guy. 
[03:47:30]  We can all relate to you, Anthony.  Thank you, Pete, my friend.  Watch it out.  Someone said he missed a great line with Billy Bats in the bar when they dragged Pesci out.  But Frank Vincent turns to his friend and says,  I used to fuck kids like him in the ass in the joint.  Does he say that?  Kind of under his breath.  I know he says something when they're like trying to calm Pesci down.  And he's like, don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  I'm going to have to watch it now again.  Again.  I didn't hear that.  Trucker Paul. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, how you guys doing this morning?  Hello, TP.  Hi.  Hey, Trucker Paul.  Hey, along with some tenor sentiments this morning, could you play that phenomenal song by Jimmy?  I haven't heard that one in a while.  That is a good one.  What song?  Oh, yeah.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  By the way, you can request that in many, many EOpie and Anthony bits.  Starting at 11.15 today, EROC Radio returns.  EROC doing requests today. 
[03:48:30]  EROC is good.  And then.  You should have seen the email I got about the last time that happened.  Good, right?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus Christ.  You can request all those little ditties and little things that we don't get to all the  time.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  So they don't have to even do a whole show.  They throw on a half-assed worst of, hosted by that incompetent asshole, EROC.  Signed, Eric Logan.  Where is Elo? 
[03:49:00]  He just came back in and he, uh, he's getting fucking breakfast.  Elo, what do you have for the Opie and Anthony show?  I got nothing.  Oh.  Oh, you got that one.  What about, uh, you know, remodeling the XM studio?  I got nothing.  What about marketing?  I got nothing.  What about more wow stickers?  I got nothing.  What about a new barber?  I got nothing. 
[03:49:30]  What about, I don't know.  What about, what about other slacks?  He's a fag.  All right, listen.  Apparently they're, uh, uh, going to, uh, announce, uh, Chris Daughtry, uh, has a big,  uh, band offer, uh, announcement that he's going to make.  They're offering.  I heard that they-  Do you think they got wind of, uh, him doing something behind, uh, their backs and said,  you know what, let's just get rid of him? 
[03:50:00]  I don't know.  Because he should not have been kicked off the show last night.  Contractually he's kind of bound to them, I think, though, right?  I heard fuel.  But fuel's got the fuel guy, doesn't he?  I know, but that's what I, I'm, I'm hearing.  But something doesn't make sense.  Something, dare I say, is fishy.  And he's announcing it on Ryan Seacrest's show?  Like, this is all too, you know, eh, convenient.  Yeah, they decided to throw us a curveball with that American Idol thing.  There's no way America voted him off. 
[03:50:30]  He's got some deal going.  Some big deal.  Well, they figure if they get a piece of it, the American Idol people would get a piece  of everybody that goes on there.  They could place him somewhere, make boatloads of cash, and then have an American Idol winner  that they could also make boatloads of cash on.  But they would also, um, have, they're already probably, they own him contractually, I'm  sure, to get this far.  Oh, yeah, yeah, to get this far.  So he probably couldn't do anything behind their backs.  Hmm.  I don't know.  So they make money, though.  That Ryan Seacrest, that kid's got something.  I call it pizzazz. 
[03:51:00]  Yes.  Uh, Steve and Beth Page.  Steve?  Yeah, Frank Vincent said, I used to fuck guys like him in the can in the ass.  In the can in the ass?  I don't know.  Like I said, got to watch the video.  Oh, I used to fuck guys like him in the can in the ass.  Right, when he was in the can.  Okay, okay.  Meaning prison.  All right, very good.  Speaking of mafia stuff, I had no idea Brother Joe did this.  Brother Joe did a song, Guitar Father.  Uh, and, and I, I didn't know, I, I listened to it last night.  I was like, holy shit, that's pretty good. 
[03:51:30]  It's, um, it's in the spirit of, like, a Gary Hoey.  You know how Gary Hoey does the Christmas songs?  Uh, but it's the Godfather.  And Joe did this all, you know, all by his lonesome in his studio.  And, uh, it's pretty cool.  Starts out a little slow, and then just rocks out.  And it's the fucking Godfather theme.  Let's take a listen to this.  By the way, Brother Joe's U2 tribute band is playing this Saturday at, uh, Tuxedo Junction.  And to you, we'll be at Tuxedo Junction, uh, Danbury, Connecticut.  That's 2 Ives Street, I guess. 
[03:52:00]  10 p.m. show this Saturday.  Here's Brother Joe doing the Godfather theme and, uh, rocking it out a little bit.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:52:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you. 
[03:53:00]  Thank you. 
[03:53:30]  Thank you. 
[03:54:00]  Thank you. 
[03:54:30]  Thank you. 
[03:55:00]  Brother Joe, Godfather's song, one of the best things I've ever heard.  Holy shit, get that up on Foundry. 
[03:55:30]  Unbelievable.  Okay.  Wow.  Cool.  Matt in Jersey.  Matt?  Yeah, I just wanted to say that fucking rocked.  I need a copy of that because I could use that at weddings, believe me.  That was pretty cool.  Yeah, weddings, right?  Yeah, a bunch of the gavones up there.  It'll be up on opanthony.com later today.  It starts off really nice and easy, kind of like Johnson-esque.  You know, Steve Jobs, what's his name?  Eric Johnson.  Eric Johnson.  Eric Johnson.  Yeah, sure.  And all of a sudden, boom.  I love it.  All right, cool.  Thanks, bro.  Yeah, it builds through the whole thing.  It's Brother Joe. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  We've got to get to that.  Mike, the trucker.  Mike?  Hey, dude, where do we download that?  I need that on my telephone.  Eatabullet.com.  Give me a wrap.  I know you ass.  It'll be up on opanthony.com.  That's the ringtone, man.  Yeah, it'll be up.  It'll be up.  All right.  It's very good.  Sweet.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  The boss is here.  Yeah, you better sit up straight.  Eric Logan.  Did this happen?  And let's see.  Joe from Idaho is saying Fox News just showed Disneyland and the caption said Predatorland and then went 
[03:56:30]  to commercial.  Yeah, they said something.  Predatorland.  Maybe we got it.  They were saying that there was some hidden dangers at Disney World.  Yes.  Maybe that's what they're talking about.  Elo, did you come back into the studio to thank us for doing extra radio?  I did.  I am so impressed.  We're not quite there yet, but in another minute.  A few more seconds.  Let me wait a few minutes just so I can prove to everybody that you guys go past 11 o'clock.  Yes.  But, Elo, can you explain to these idiots that our contract states that we could go home at 11 any day we want? 
[03:57:00]  Any day you want.  Look at them while you're addressing them.  Oh, when Opus said the idiots.  Where's my food?  I assumed it was Jimmy and Steve.  Why do I have to be the butt of jokes?  Why do I have to be...  What's the word?  Because it's fun.  Shit.  By the way, Elo, is pink the new power tie?  Yeah, you are wearing a pink tie.  I'm meeting a very powerful and influential personality tonight.  Ooh.  Oprah.  Yes, I am.  I want to meet Oprah and get a picture with her.  Yes.  Maybe she's calling.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[03:57:30]  What's that?  It was a guy named Glenn.  Glenn going, hey, dude, you're on the radio.  I hear you on the radio.  Go away.  You're bad.  So you're wearing pink for Oprah today.  What corporate book told you that you should wear pink ties?  There's a website.  It's called corporatenob.com.  And you just go there and it says, if you're meeting a powerful woman, wear a pink tie.  One of the keys of success in the corporate world is making sure you suck up to the boss,  which is why I vanished for a while and since the time with Mr. P. 
[03:58:00]  Sure.  But then, Anthony, I'd like to ask you a question.  Oh, no.  Of course.  Of course.  Have you noticed anything different about me since we've last spoken?  Your hair looks very nice.  Well, that's one thing.  I do.  It looks different about you.  She still has a wedding ring.  All right.  Barely.  That's something.  Barely hang.  You're wearing a hangnail.  It's something visual that I should pick up on?  Yes.  It was something that you were razzing me about.  I did.  You did.  You did.  I must.  Yeah, it's right there in front of you. 
[03:58:30]  It's right in front of you.  I must not even.  I figure with all the OCD this guy is trying to hide from, right?  I'm so scared right now.  Why?  I took off my little pin.  Oh, the pin.  The little National Socialist XM pin.  I get a complex.  I'm like, I feel like an Amway salesman.  Now I took it off.  XM has these little round pins.  I will never wear this again.  I've got a complex here.  I'm going to leave it.  I'll wear it.  Here, take it.  I don't want it.  I got one.  It's in black and white and has a nice symbol on it and red.  You can walk right into Congress with that. 
[03:59:00]  They won't stop you.  This is the XM one.  It's silver, but it's round, and it goes on your lapel.  The people down in Washington a lot are wearing this.  Yeah.  It always reminds me of a Nazi pin.  Could you hold it up?  Because they all had to wear it.  I wasn't going to take it off while we were over there, but I took it off afterwards.  Yeah?  I just didn't want to.  I knew it.  You really?  You need this?  No, it's all yours.  Can I have it?  I'll never wear it.  Because this is yours.  That's kind of special.  That's right.  Can I see it?  Thank you.  No.  You will break it. 
[03:59:30]  He will break it.  He breaks a lot of stuff.  By the way, your smoothie came.  Opie grabbed it and heaved it into the garbage pail.  I did not.  Yes, you did.  What are you doing to me lately?  You drunk it.  Trying to keep you in line, mister.  What are you doing?  I want to hold this job.  Are you trying to break up the band?  You're trying to break up the band.  You're trying to break up the band.  Wedge between us.  What are you doing?  No, you have to stay.  The Ed and Anthony show doesn't sound right.  Ed.  Ed Norton.  Oh, that couldn't have made me feel better. 
[04:00:00]  After Edward Norton knew who you were.  Likes me.  Yeah, likes you.  And a nice honeymoon room.  Oh, yeah.  I hated the fact that he knew you, like, knew who you were.  And remember you mentioned my bit?  You know how it is when two people, two artists appreciate each other's work?  Oh, I know.  Hilo, shut up.  Hilo.  Stupid.  Just shut up.  Hey, I'm subpar.  Hilo.  Fucking sellouts.  Have you got something to say?  Okay, it's official.  No. 
[04:00:30]  It's official now.  I want all of the XM pests and all the XM fans to know that Opie and Anthony and Jim  Norton are on XM for the love of the broadcast at this point.  Right.  It's official.  Actually, this portion of the show is free because we don't get paid to be here.  This is free.  This is free.  Well, most of what you do is free anyway.  Bonus show.  Free radio.  Thank you for noticing.  I always give Jim extra love because most of what he does is free anyway, so.  There you go.  So we're doing free radio.  We're doing free radio now.  This is free.  That's right. 
[04:01:00]  We don't get paid to be here right now.  Extra radio, my ass.  You're still doing subpar regular radio and we still get two hours of XM and want us to  kiss your asses for, where is it, it?  Staying late.  Staying late.  Yes.  Fucking sellouts.  That's John K. from Westville, New Jersey.  How do you ban people on that?  Right.  Well, I'll show you.  I'll show you.  You go to John K. here and it says ban this IP address.  Are you sure?  And then you see it?  You want to blacklist and then you go yes and you hit continue and now John will not 
[04:01:30]  be able to send another one.  Oh, he'll type it in and it'll say thank you for your comment just like he thinks he's  instant for feedback.  Never seen it.  But we will never again see a comment from him.  Oh, you don't even know they're banned?  No.  Oh, that's hot.  The best part of being banned, they have no clue.  They type and everything you type is a big waste of time.  We never see it.  That's funny.  It's really kind of cool to tell them they're banned though because this is where the frustration  is.  This is just told him.  Bonus radio.  Thank you, Elo.  I just want to point that out again.  Bonus radio. 
[04:02:00]  Here's Alan Stiffin.  Yeah.  This is.  Wait, Elo did.  Why did he only give us that part of it?  Wait, wait.  We want the only part of it.  Because he probably gives the date.  Huh?  Probably gives the date.  It doesn't matter.  But I like his whole thing.  Yeah, it's Alan Stiffin.  Here's Alan Stiffin.  Yes, this is.  This is.  No.  But who cut that off?  I don't care what he talks about.  Oh, they're all pointing at Than.  They're all pointing at him in there.  If he mentions the other subject matter that comes up, it's fine. 
[04:02:30]  But it's like the mecca of all radio message boards.  It's.  Than.  Hey, Than.  What did you edit with?  A fucking machete?  Than.  He never messes up.  He's cranky today, by the way.  He even confessed it.  He's in a bad mood.  I even asked him if it was something personal.  And I don't even care.  I just asked.  Yeah.  And I could give a shit about the answer.  But I asked.  Whatever's wrong, we hope it hurts.  Yes.  I just want to point out one more time.  This is free radio.  Absolutely. 
[04:03:00]  Great.  It's bonus show.  It's bonus show.  Five minutes and counting.  By God.  This is free XM.  That's right.  Send your bills to Elo.  He will pay all bills.  That's a new promo.  Pay your bills.  That's a good one.  Pay your bills.  Wow.  That would be good.  Elo will pay all your bills in the month of June.  There you go.  Good promotion.  That's about to begin.  It's at.  Jerk off.  Yeah.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  What medication is that?  I hate this place. 
[04:03:30]  I've been here for seven years.  You've only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Okay, go with me.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Yeah.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  I'm going to have you lie down over here.  I hate this place.  And then we'll get you some medication, okay?  Stand today.  The medications don't work.  Look at the back on your stretcher.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  It took 18 months, but then finally he's having a bad day. 
[04:04:00]  Elo, I mean, I'm sorry.  Iroch, please loop that.  And from whatever time we get off until 12, just play that.  Just play that.  Then you'll see how good we are.  Hey, hey, then.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  I still love it when people were calling into Frank the other day with, like, lines of  the movie that he was not even in.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He did.  Remember when you said, Charlie, I could have been a contender?  No, I don't. 
[04:04:30]  Shut up.  Here we go.  I've got to be careful.  Let's get to the Alan sniffing.  Yeah, now that we don't have the theme.  Could we do the theme song?  I'll be pleased.  I'd love to hear the theme and Alan talking up his program.  Oh, where are you going?  I've got to go across to USA Today.  I've got to go.  USA Today?  Yeah.  Nice.  Are you taking an announcement or?  I don't know.  Is it something?  I'm sure it's some sort of thing for things.  Is a newspaper coming to satellite radio?  We'll have the full story at 11.  No.  But I'm just looking at your call sheet.  So next time I'm in town, we'll do that.  What?  You know, your little, all the screenings.  Oh, they all like asking Elo questions. 
[04:05:00]  Yeah, they all got those questions.  Ask Elo.  I like it.  It's a feature on this program.  I'll come in and do that.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That's Nathaniel O'Brien.  He's out of breath.  Now, Dan, before we play it, why did you feel that you should have just cut that?  Well, see, Steve, no, I messed up.  Oh, wow.  You messed up?  Yeah.  I just cut a little short.  The buck stops here.  I like it.  A little short.  Yeah.  Do you have the whole thing now where he talks about?  It goes through his whole jingle.  The mecca of all.  I stop him right before he goes to his first item.  Okay.  Very good. 
[04:05:30]  All right.  Can I wait and see if it works?  You had a bad day.  You couldn't cut a fucking promo.  Now it's not playing?  Oh.  He didn't finalize the disc.  Because you had a bad day.  Here we go.  Here's Alan Sniffin.  Yes, this is Alan Sniffin.  And I've got board reflections for May 11, 2006.  Music Radio 77.com.  That's right.  Board reflections.  Try to make comments about comments being made to the New York Radio Message Board. 
[04:06:00]  Board the mecca of all Internet Radio Message Boards.  He's got the echo.  Oh, he's got the reverb on that.  Yeah, he loves it.  You've got to reintroduce Alan Sniffin because there's a lot of people out there that haven't  heard about Alan Sniffin.  Alan Sniffin runs the New York Radio Message Board.  As he said, the mecca of all Radio Message Boards.  Anything in New York Radio ends up on his message board.  The guy definitely has turned a message board into a place where radio professionals do come  and share information, rumors, talk about the state of New York Radio. 
[04:06:30]  Everyone reads it.  Everyone in radio, yeah, goes there and reads it because there are people in the business  that post there.  And then there are just jerk-offs that don't know anything that post there.  And there are people in the industry.  And Alan Sniffin, by the way, is a dentist, which is the funniest part of the whole thing.  He's a dentist.  It's also a great place to go when a big deal is completely dead in the water.  Yeah.  And you feel like the deal shouldn't be dead, so you want to maybe get some interest going.  Uh-huh.  So you might email Alan. 
[04:07:00]  It might go to the rumor mill.  And maybe start a rumor to get things going again and get people talking.  A buzz.  To get a buzz.  It could also be a message board to go to under 6,342 pseudonyms to just tell people  to go fuck themselves.  Yes.  The New York Radio message board.  We love Alan.  Tell you the truth.  Be honest.  We've definitely butted heads with each other. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, you've got to go.  No, where's your old air checks?  Oh, I was going to say them while you're interrupting me.  You were supposed to bring yours, and I'll bring mine.  I'm in the middle of a goddamn conversation.  Okay, who you are?  I found it.  I found it.  I'm leaving.  But that's one thing I was going to mention, too.  It's a free...  Hey, listen.  I'm breaking your balls on you.  No matter what, you're getting fucking fished.  This is bonus time.  It's free time.  Free time doesn't mean suck time.  Okay.  Oh, no, no, no.  According to the subscribers, it does.  I know.  That's true.  Funny.  That's right.  Hey, hey.  Somebody teach this kid some fucking manners. 
[04:08:00]  Some manners.  That's all I'm going to say for the rest of the fucking show.  Shit, dicks.  Get used to it.  Hey, we got a...  Bonus jokes.  We got a big-time celebrity that wants in on bonus time.  Jay Moore!  Jay Moore!  Ladies and gentlemen.  Jay Moore!  Now go get your fucking shine bar.  Motherfucker, sorry about your floor.  Sorry about your floor.  I didn't want to get blood on your floor.  I didn't want to get blood on your floor.  I didn't mean to get blood on your floor.  I like the bonus time. 
[04:08:30]  I wake up to take a week, and my friends are on the radio.  You just wake up for bonus time?  Well, he's in L.A.  Jesus.  I wake up for bonus time.  It's like tissue time, but it's bonus time.  That's true.  That's true.  So it is early over there.  Yeah, sure.  Jay Moore, how are things going, man?  Things are going good.  I don't really have any jokes prepared.  I just wanted to call.  I love you.  And that's it.  And we get...  See, what happens on bonus time?  You never know who's going to drop in.  I signed my son up for swimming lessons.  All right.  That's good. 
[04:09:00]  How's he doing?  He's doing well.  I took him to the YMCA, because I like the way Mexican piss feels in my eyes.  Just to keep him away from Tommy Lee's pool.  And keep him away from the Peterson boastful, Jimmy.  Wait, he's breaking your balls.  Right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Aren't you guys happy to see Frank Vincent on the Sopranos? 
[04:09:30]  Dude, it was so...  He was on our show the other day.  We sat right there and talked to the guy.  It's like, to me, sitting next to a fucking legend.  That's what it is.  I don't want him to fuck me.  There will always be the guy throwing Annabelle Skiola's clothes out the window going,  You're a nigger fucker!  I got to see that clip.  I watched that the other day.  A nigger!  I would rather you be a pedophile or a murderer than a nigger lover!  Oh, it's brutal.  What movie is that?  Jungle Fever.  Jungle Fever. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  That's a great movie, man.  It's a fucking great movie.  Black Beauty with Dakota Fanning.  Coming up on Fox News, Save Our Kids.  So we want to get that taped.  It's a Disney thing.  Disney Predators.  So we want to see that.  Jay Moore.  See, you know what bonus time is like?  It's like the end of laughing when the little doors that open up and people tell jokes.  Look, Jay Moore's there.  You never knew who was going to pop open a door and tell a joke.  I smash gunk.  Fucking Marty Johnson. 
[04:10:30]  Take it easy, Jay.  Bye, doll face.  Thank you.  We love Jay Moore.  Hey, Indy Mike, what's up?  Indy Mike, why are you calling him?  What's going on, Indy Mike?  Welcome to the program.  Hey, guys.  It's great to talk to you all.  Hey to Jay Moore.  Just calling in to welcome everybody to bonus time, even though Elo kind of stole some of  my thunder, but I still figured I should call in.  Elo stole your bit.  That's all right.  He can do that.  That's part of being that Uber fan thing.  We appreciate it and we love it all.  He stole your bit and Robert Reed's tie.  That tie is awful. 
[04:11:00]  A horrible pink pussy tie.  Oh, my God.  What does he think?  Oprah's going to go, oh, nice tie.  It's pink.  Stop.  Even Oprah's going to call him a faggot.  Absolutely.  Who's the fruit?  Get him out of here.  She'll tell him to tie it around his gay neck and swing from the rafters.  Oprah should blow.  Oprah.  I just said opera.  It's Oprah.  That's all right.  Same size.  This is free.  Thank God we're not getting paid for this.  There's no pressure in bonus time.  That's the beauty of it.  We know we're not getting paid.  I could do this in bonus time.  I'll do that for a half hour. 
[04:11:30]  Keep going.  I won't stop you.  Alan Sniffen might get mad.  Alan Sniffen, board reflection.  So he has this message board.  Message board.  And then every week or so, if there's a lot of stories, he does what's called board reflection.  It's a little audio blog.  It's a little podcast type thing.  Audio cast of the biggest subjects that have been on his message board that week.  And we sometimes come up on there.  A lot of people like us.  A lot of supporters.  A lot of haters on there. 
[04:12:00]  And Alan, we butted heads with him.  A couple times we don't agree with a few things.  But some things we do agree on.  And he's a nice enough guy.  That's for sure.  All right.  And this is his board reflection.  I want to do an impression.  This is something no one in the civilized world has ever heard.  Ooh.  Honey, keep it down.  I'm trying to listen to board reflections.  All right.  It probably doesn't get out to that many people.  And some of the subject matter could be a little dull. 
[04:12:30]  We choose boring stuff for bonus time.  Let's just be honest.  But he puts the echo on like he's on the old WABC radio.  All right.  By the way, we can't start the bit without the song playing again.  Oh, my God.  It's unconstitutional, O.P.  You have to.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  I want some bonus time music.  I want to dance.  I'm breaking your balls, and right away you're getting fucking fresh.  I'm putting in a filling, and right away you're getting fucking fresh. 
[04:13:00]  I don't want to play board reflections.  You don't want to play the fucking thing.  Hey, somebody get this kid some fucking listening people.  Listening people.  High risk sex offenders in motels near Disneyland.  Get that story for tomorrow.  Absolutely.  Get the name of that motel.  God, it's such a hot topic these days.  Here's Alan Sniffen.  Yes, this is Alan Sniffen, and I've got board reflections for May 11, 2006. 
[04:13:30]  Musicradio77.com.  That's right, board reflections.  Where I make comments about comments being made to the New York Radio Message Board,  the mecca of all Internet radio message boards.  Spit and rinse.  So, he talks about the new O&A show.  Ooh.  Even though we've been doing it for a very long time, but it's new for terrestrial radio,  and for a lot of people that haven't heard us in like four years or so.  On a fresh Opie and Anthony.  So, he asked the question, is the new O&A show better? 
[04:14:00]  Than what?  Than the old version.  Sliced bread?  Than the old version before we got fired.  Oh.  Here's the answer to that question.  All right, Jim.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  Bonus time.  Check your pants, please.  You know, I wrote a letter yesterday to the guy that wrote the little article in Forbes magazine  because he called us immature.  And I wrote a nice letter about that, and you have to do that into the microphone. 
[04:14:30]  You know what would have been funny?  If you wrote it in crayon.  And said, dear Mr. Dum Dum.  Dummy.  I resent that.  You are a poo-poo head.  And put your R's backwards.  That's how I register at the hotel by Disneyland.  I'm Mr. X.  20-plus high-risk offenders in local motels.  Nice. 
[04:15:00]  Fine.  I don't know how many are wearing fucking Disney costumes parading around that park with fucking rods.  Mama, goofy made my butt hurt.  All right.  Some sex offenders have been moved.  Quiet, you little snitch.  Hi-ho, hi-ho.  I'll teach you how to blow.  You won't remember.  You'll think you're eating cutkin.  Hi-ho, hi-ho, hi-ho.  Hi-ho.  Into a locked little area, those memories will go. 
[04:15:30]  Not bad.  Here we go.  I'm sipping.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  A totally destroyed life for me.  It's a small bum, ma-na-na-na-na.  It's a small bum.  After all.  All right.  Sorry.  No, this is silly.  Alan Sniff in Board Reflections.  Is the new O&A show better?  Wanted to make some comments about Opie and Anthony. 
[04:16:00]  I saw somebody, a brief comment on the board, and I think it was on the board, or I'm not  sure where I saw this, where somebody was being kind of critical of Opie and Anthony, saying  the show is not as edge-cutting, as pushy as it used to be.  People are comparing it to the WNEW show.  So, you know, I guess it depends on what you're looking for here.  I mean, if you're looking for them to send a couple into St. Patrick's Cathedral, be realistic  here.  I mean, they'd have to be crazy to do that kind of stuff again, because that's what got  them into trouble before. 
[04:16:30]  You know, you've got to remember a couple of things here.  First of all, the environment has changed in the last five years.  So we were just talking about that with Star.  Global warming.  There are things you cannot do today that you could do five years ago.  The FCC is more active, concerned by parent corporations, is much greater.  CBS Radio, which formerly, as Infinity, canceled Opie and Anthony over a previous stunt.  Well, they're back to working for the same company now on Free FM.  You can't do the real off-the-wall stuff, because, again, it will garner all kinds of outside 
[04:17:00]  publicity and end up generating problems for the show itself and for the company.  So if you expect Opie and Anthony to do the kind of stuff that got him into trouble the  last time, that is an unreasonable expectation.  That would be stupid, and they're not stupid.  So if that's what you're looking for, come on, be realistic here.  Yeah.  Thank you, Alan.  And yes, you are.  That is true. 
[04:17:30]  The climate has changed, but we're finding ways around it.  And I think every day we push a little more.  We see what we can get away with.  If you listen to today's show on FM, as opposed to our first or second show, you'll see where  we're discussing subject matter that we wouldn't discuss on those first days.  And before you know it, we'll be fired right out that door.  Secondly, I think to some extent Opie and Anthony's show is better now than it was before. 
[04:18:00]  Oh, look at that.  To this extent.  All right.  I've listened to it also.  I don't comment too much about shows I don't listen to, but I have listened to them.  Some of their more recent bits concerning the news media, some of the best radio satire  I've heard, and that includes Stern, and that includes Imus, who also have done some very  good satire against mass media and radio and TV news and so forth.  But some of Opie and Anthony's bits these days, which I've heard, that have centered around 
[04:18:30]  the TV news media and how they sensationalize stories and sit around and talk about them  and the Arnold Diaz shame stories on Channel 5 or, you know, Anthony did this great chicken  clucking thing, bunch of hens sitting around and talking when they were making a parody out  of some of the TV news stories where the email anchors were sitting around talking about  a story afterwards or whatever. 
[04:19:00]  That stuff is very funny.  And I think actually may have broader appeal, no pun intended, but may have broader appeal  than focusing the show on TNA, which I know some of you, that's what you want them to do.  All right.  Sorry.  It is satellite, and I can say that.  I called them hens, and he clucked.  I clucked.  No, you clucked.  I said hens, though.  It was Ed that said hens.  Ed Norton said hens. 
[04:19:30]  I did the clucking.  Oh, fucking 21 and counting.  We are fucking dedicated people.  Look at us.  Flying free.  Free.  Free.  And they are doing some of that, so I don't want to make it sound as if they've taken a  totally different course with the show.  There is still, you know, the mousetraps and the studio and all of that stuff, which they've  also been doing.  So I don't want to overstate this.  But I think the criticism by some of you about what they're doing, I think in effect, to that  degree, the show is better now than it was before. 
[04:20:00]  Because I think that stuff, the stuff that is not going to get you into trouble, but is  still very funny.  And I think this attack on the mass media, as they call it, I'm not in favor of standing  behind reporters with placards and blowing off horns and getting people fired.  I've criticized that before.  So I think there's a limit to it.  So don't misunderstand me.  But I think some of the stuff they're doing, at least that I've heard, on Free FM is funny  without being dangerous. 
[04:20:30]  Dangerous by that I mean getting the station, getting the management, getting them into trouble.  I think the show has evolved to some extent.  And I think that's a good thing.  Is there a basketball game waiting to start?  Like waiting for Alan to finish on the court?  That would be great to just hear, doong, doong, doong.  Someone's dribbling waiting.  I'll be done in a second.  He's broadcasting from Mr. Hanalei's living room. 
[04:21:00]  Let's go to Rochelle Park, Chris.  Yeah, you guys are killing me today.  I'm driving a sweeper up and down people's curbs.  I'm going to have to pay for all these lawns.  Oh, thank you, Chris.  Thank you, sir.  Don't hurt anybody.  All right.  Yeah, knocking open mailboxes.  Driving through people's backyards.  Got a girl in the car.  That's a man.  Got a broom under the car.  That's a shitty job.  You know, there are many people who believe the greatest enemy the Opie and Anthony have is themselves. 
[04:21:30]  There was a comment I made back in 1999 when they first came to New York.  I said, listen, the biggest threat they face is if they will do something to get themselves into trouble.  And, of course, that's what had happened.  And now that wasn't any greatly insightful argument on my part because that's what had happened in Boston.  So you could kind of figure there might be some issues sooner or later.  But it seems to me, so far, it's only been a couple of weeks, that they're doing radio that is less likely to create a big controversy and create problems. 
[04:22:00]  It's okay to create controversy.  It's not okay to create problems.  And I think the show has evolved into something that is a little bit more compatible with the environment that they're broadcasting in.  This is not satellite radio.  This is over-air FM radio.  Look what just happened to Star.  You cannot push the limits like you used to, nor should you.  It creates bad publicity, gets you into trouble, isn't worth it. 
[04:22:30]  All right.  Game on.  Very good.  One more clip.  Oh.  Is Opie and Anthony's show the same as it was five years ago on WNEW?  No.  Does that mean it's worse?  In my opinion, no.  If anything, I think it's somewhat better.  It has evolved into something a little bit less likely to create problems for them and their bosses.  And I think that's smart radio.  And I applaud them for it.  And, again, I'm not looking for them to turn this into an I'm a show where they're talking politics. 
[04:23:00]  And I'm not looking for this to be a Sean Hannity news-oriented show.  I'm not arguing for any of that.  Go ahead.  Have a good time.  Make fun of people.  I can handle that.  You know, that group camaraderie.  We're all sitting around the bar talking together.  Got this thing going.  I'm in favor of all of it.  That's exactly what the show ought to be.  Just don't get into trouble over it.  And right now, they're not.  Smart radio doing the right thing.  Thank you, Alan Sniffin.  Thank you, Alan.  Yeah, it's been fun so far over there. 
[04:23:30]  That guy knows his bicuspids.  We should, uh...  I think it's a tooth.  Oh, I thought that was a tooth that likes teeth of both genders.  You screwed that up.  I know.  I said tooths.  I'm a mealy-mouthed ass today.  I'm really tired because I had a very intense acting scene last night.  You know how it is.  Oh, very intense?  Yeah.  Can you do it for us now?  No, I'll talk to Edward about it when I see him.  Hey, Jimmy.  What do you want, sweetie?  Boston tomorrow.  Orphan Theater with David Tell. 
[04:24:00]  I may be even doing BCN in the afternoon.  We got Billy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We got Billy Burr.  Bill Burr will be in tomorrow for Jimmy Norton.  Have fun in Boston, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  Some tickets still available for the Orphan Show.  Ticketmaster.  Ticketmaster, right?  You want to hear another song by David Lee Roth?  Strumming with the Devil.  Not really.  The southern side of Van Halen.  We heard Jump.  You want to hear I'll Wait, Running with the Devil.  Could be good.  Dance the Night Away, Jamie's Crying, Hot for Teacher, Feel Your Love Tonight.  Unchained, Panama.  I want to hear the country version. 
[04:24:30]  The country version.  It's just a jig, you know?  Holy.  What?  That's what the country people say.  It certainly is.  It's a cacta.  Running with the Devil, maybe?  It's a cacta.  Yeah, Running with the Devil, one of Van Halen's more popular songs.  Sure.  All right.  Let's hear that one.  How hard do you think Eddie is laughing at this?  Jesus, loud phone.  Whose phone is that?  Is that your phone? 
[04:25:00]  Yeah.  That's actually his phone.  It's Huntington.  Hello?  What deal is this now?  Yeah.  Oh, you have Farid on the line for us?  Sure.  All right.  Let's get Farid.  Jesus.  Well, it's after 11, so he probably thinks, yeah, that's it.  Are you on the air?  No.  No.  He's not.  That would be crazy for us to actually put the CEO of Citadel on the air twice, knowing  that he probably got pissed off the first time we did it. 
[04:25:30]  How's the stock?  Oh, you got calls from Julie Kahn?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, she hates us, doesn't she?  Julie Kahn.  Yeah, she's the GM of AAF, I think.  AAF.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  This is good.  By the way, this has to be one of the big deals that Howard had on the table, the guy  that calls us every day.  Oh, she runs the whole cluster for what?  They call it a cluster fuck. 
[04:26:00]  She's a real woman power.  Uh-oh.  So maybe we shouldn't bash her?  Pink ties for everybody when we meet her.  All right.  Pink ties.  Oh, my goodness.  It's a bonus time, people, by the way.  That's right.  Just want everybody to know, just because Opie's taking a phone call, it's bonus time still.  You got to talk to Bob.  So it still has...  There's no way we deal without Bob Eatman.  All right.  Bob...  When can we be on in Providence?  Bob...  In two weeks, we'll be on in Providence? 
[04:26:30]  Get in touch with him immediately.  We don't do deals without our agent.  That's right.  That's good.  Wait, who's Tony?  You know how I...  Who's Tony?  You're going to have to work with Howard.  I got to pee so bad.  Wait, Tony Berardini's working for you?  I got to...  Is he consulting?  Oh, okay.  I was just confused, because I know...  I thought he was still, like, helping out CBS.  More failure.  Oh, we're failing more.  Is it wrong that I have my hands down my pants?  Get your hands out of your goddamn pants. 
[04:27:00]  And I'm thinking of Sam.  Well, okay.  Keep him there.  He's a spelt and hairless.  Sam.  We know we're better now than we were before.  That's what I was trying to tell you when you told me I was going to blow up my career again.  Ten motels full of pedophiles fighting in Sam's house.  Hello.  Well, his house is like a Disneyland.  He's the holy grail for kid touchers.  You've never seen Anthony that lively.  Ooh.  What the hell?  It's about time he carries his weight, I got to tell you. 
[04:27:30]  Holy shit.  I've been carrying his ass for, I don't know, eight, nine years now.  Yeah.  I stink.  Put the camera back on me.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to get some reality here.  No, Anthony gets 40, I get 60.  Hey!  But wait a minute.  That's 100.  Oh!  Oh!  It's all gone after 100.  That is not the way things go.  But seriously, we're going to be on in Providence in two weeks?  That'd be nice.  What about Reno?  What about some of these other markets? 
[04:28:00]  New Orleans needs help.  We know that.  One at a time.  We can make them forget the hurricane.  Fareed, be honest.  Howard, you didn't offer Howard a deal, did you?  Absolutely not.  Of course not.  Why did it make so much news?  You didn't?  Ridiculous.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, you denied it to Wall Street Journal?  Good.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Did they print it?  I have a really serious question for you.  Why do you think Howard went on the air and had an AP guy and all that to say that he wasn't 
[04:28:30]  going back to a regular radio?  I think Mel was so pissed off that the stock was messed up.  Yeah.  That's a bad thing.  But it was weird because you know Howard, he would have milked the whole going back to  regular radio thing for a while, but he went on the air and made sure.  Why isn't your hand still down?  It was perfectly clear that he wasn't going back.  Why are you still sitting there looking that good?  By the way, we're a half hour into bonus show.  Boner time. 
[04:29:00]  Boner time.  I'm all tired.  I know.  Do you honestly think anyone came to him?  No.  I didn't think you were.  He did that.  It was a total knee-jerk reaction to us getting failure after failure like we are now.  Right.  Listen, you're hearing yet another failure of the O.P. and Anthony show, people.  I got you.  Of course, unless this ruins the whole thing.  Wait, Jimmy.  Sorry.  He pulled his zipper down and showed me just a little real estate.  I don't know what part it was.  I'll tell you. 
[04:29:30]  It was fleshy and I saw a vein.  Above the helmet and below the balls.  Oh, okay.  Again, completely careless.  How pissed off do you think he is that we're doing this deal?  You're like a snake.  This won't ruin it.  Not even a hair.  Oh, this won't ruin it.  No.  No.  I don't think so.  Right.  Yeah, he is so over.  We've been seeing that for a while.  Look at that.  Shaving.  Well, you better belly up to the bar quick because there's some markets coming.  Yeah.  There's some markets coming.  Right.  Joel Hollander said.  Oh, really?  He promised.  Not promised.  He guaranteed more markets for the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[04:30:00]  He did.  Guaranteed more markets.  I get to pee so bad.  For this program.  You can't pee yet because I can't talk to no one and I need to keep talking.  I know.  We do need background noise.  I'm not going to talk to E-Rock.  Why would you?  What would I say?  Mr.  Mayo, Mayo, Mayo, Hellman's, Hellman's.  Mayo, Mayo, Mistake.  You don't have bacon anymore?  Cool.  I don't care.  Jimmy.  Mistake.  Mistake, Mayo, Bacon.  Mistake, Bacon, Mayo.  We finished power off, you think?  Error.  Fucked up.  Yeah, I think we finished him off. 
[04:30:30]  Error.  Fucked up.  He's got to be livid that we're doing both.  Because this was the deal to make the whole time.  Why stand Frank?  Best of both worlds.  Actually, you knew that because you tried to make it happen, what?  The last Christmas?  He tried to keep us from satellite.  He certainly did.  Never let him forget that.  Yeah, we've got to get back on the air.  What do you want me to do?  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Bye, Uncle Fareed.  What's your name?  Anthony.  Anthony's saying hi, by the way.  I said, hi, Fareed.  I don't have time to talk to him.  I hate management. 
[04:31:00]  I hate talking to management.  Anthony, stay fit.  Oh, Jesus.  We've got to go.  We've got to work out the details.  Wow.  It would be a pleasure to work for you again, my friend.  I don't know.  Thank you.  Once them rotors hit, it's all over.  Why didn't they just turn the helicopter off?  You just shut it off.  Just a flare.  Just a flare.  I want you to stick this pontoon up her ass.  All right.  We've got deals to make.  What was that?  You're just leaving?  It's a bonus show.  I don't like this end to bonus time. 
[04:31:30]  I don't like it to end like that.  No.  You can't just walk away from the program, Opie.  Are there breaks during bonus time, or once we break, we leave?  Oh, you want to take a break?  We could take a break.  Let me tell you.  Look.  We'll take a break.  We might be back.  We might not.  Go fuck yourself.  You're getting this for nothing.  You got...  You cocksucked.  What?  Thirty-four minutes, of which two were quality.  We're going to take a break, and then you wait and see if we come back. 
[04:32:00]  Well, I have to go do ADR for Lucky Louie.  Oh, that's when you talk over stuff.  You put over unfunny stuff on top of the hysterical hilarity that you did in the first place.  Yes.  All right.  Well, Jimmy won't be back then.  No, I'm busy.  I might be back here.  Opie might come back.  I'm sure he's probably on the phone outside of the studio apologizing profusely.  Well, this is great.  Look at that.  We're getting phone calls from important people. 
[04:32:30]  Sorry.  Sorry, I'm professional.  Well, how do we end this with a pizzazz?  Let's just say break time.  I know.  It's got to be something good.  All right.  How about...  That's it.  Go to break now.  And then...  Then...  Here comes breaks.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Back...  Way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois. 
[04:33:00]  I believe it was WRCW.  Not sure of the call letters.  1590 day timer.  Signed off at sunrise.  Sunset, rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Oh!  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The, uh...  Opie and Anthony show.  XM202.  Is this on?  Is this on?  Is this on?  I bring nothing to the table. 
[04:33:30]  Oh, yeah, you do.  Nice.  You bring requests.  Is this on?  Switching it up.  Yes, it's on.  Christ.  Baby seems we never...  I believe this is Opposites Attract.  Of course.  Paul Abdul.  It's, uh...  Now do your radio voice.  Hey, it's Z-Rock Radio.  There you go.  Fan, Danny, contestant number 32, all in the studio here.  Just picking your requests. 
[04:34:00]  Can you turn off that one?  Because it's hard to hear that one when that one's on.  Yeah, dummy.  Now talk, contestant.  That's...  Yeah.  There you go.  I wired this whole studio.  No, I didn't.  I want to see Mark get angry.  He car crashed you.  So we're taking your requests.  Yes, comedy fountain, Travis.  This car crashed me.  Bitch.  And all that stuff.  And I believe Fan is going to start this thing.  Enough banter, was it? 
[04:34:30]  All right.  We're going to go into our first bit.  We have precious little time.  It's an oldie but goodie.  Brian from Boston.  Here's...  He spelled Torrance.  I think it's Tourette's Whorehouse.  Hit it, E-Rock.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu. 
[04:35:00]  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's Syndrome.  Mm-hmm.  Which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred...  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start. 
[04:35:30]  And then from there, the sky's the limit because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Oh, okay. 
[04:36:00]  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I  could get a little wild.  You know, when I get...  Is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take...  MasterCard? 
[04:36:30]  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's worth your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe? 
[04:37:00]  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever.  Do you have any...  Girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay? 
[04:37:30]  But wait...  But stay.  But Derek, stay.  Derek came in and doesn't want to talk.  He doesn't like the attention.  He's behind the scenes guy.  Oh, and he just came in to tell us how much time we have left.  Well, I hope...  And it's not a lot, so we've got to cram some more stuff in.  Step all over me.  Let's, uh...  Here's a drop for you.  It's E-Rock Radio.  Yes.  It's E-Rock.  Who gave Ben a mic? 
[04:38:00]  Who gave Ben a mic?  Take a request, E-Rock.  Come on.  Good job here.  It's E-Rock Radio.  Let's talk to...  Thanks, Ben.  Let's talk to Indy Mike.  Indy Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Just wanted to thank you for bringing us E-Rock Radio.  We appreciate it.  And also to encourage anyone that's listening to go over to FullBlownEights.com and vote  for, uh...  Travis, I think, is number 32 in the list.  That's right.  Check him out.  That's a great call, E-Rock.  Well, I thought this was a request hour. 
[04:38:30]  I thought you had something to do, Ben.  Oh!  You're getting fucking fresh!  I'm breaking your balls on you, no matter what you're getting fucking fake.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  Take a request, E-Rock.  Come on.  All right.  Uh, let's go to, uh, Minneapolis, Minneapolis, whatever, Keymaster.  Jesus.  What's up?  Hey, how about, uh, Special Olympics?  You'll see them.  Now, see, that's not what you were requesting.  Eric, did you actually do this for a living somewhere?  Not talk.  Not talk.  He sounded so hurt.  That's not what you requested. 
[04:39:00]  So play what he requested.  I'll find what he requested.  Hang on.  All right.  Danny, now with Baker.  Classic E-Rock just trails off the mic, like the broadcast professional that he is.  Yeah.  Oh, he's coming back.  Okay.  I bring nothing to the table.  It does make you guys sound really good.  All right.  Thanks, man.  You rule.  It's all positive here.  Okay.  He wants to hear Special Olympics.  Hi, Steve.  Here's Stephen Lynch.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics. 
[04:39:30]  Special Olympics.  Watch them fall into the pool that's diving at the Special Olympics.  Olympics.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell. 
[04:40:00]  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball gotta be about the funniest friggin' thing I've ever seen in my life.  At the Special Olympics.  Verse 2.  Kid with downs wins the race, even though he stood in place. 
[04:40:30]  Olympics.  Smash them.  Olympics.  Round his neck, gold medals hung, resting on his giant tongue.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  But I kid when I sing. 
[04:41:00]  Cause these games are a beautiful thing.  Okay, really, I'm just avoiding karma cause I know my children could be born crippled and blind and so am I retired and I'll have to spend all my time.  At the Special Olympics.  I feel so guilty, I can't even tell you.  Stephen Lynch, everybody.  The big Broadway star, Stephen Lynch, starring in The Wedding Singer on Broadway, which actually got pretty good reviews, so I hear. 
[04:41:30]  Have you seen it?  No, I do want to go, though.  I'm sure it's pretty good.  I haven't seen it.  Ben?  Yes.  Seen it?  No.  Okay, Ben.  That's a round, I'm getting a thumbs up from the booth on the banter we're doing.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  Okay, Brian in Dallas, what's up?  Yeah, hey, this is Brian in Dallas.  Hey, Brian.  Al is not a hat.  Someone else lied to the screener.  This is going to be the new book.  Actually, that's what I requested. 
[04:42:00]  Sam, care to come in here, please?  Yeah, get in here, Sam.  Sam, we don't have a lot of time.  Get in here.  All right, thanks, Brian.  We'll get that on for you.  All right, buddy?  All right, appreciate it, guys.  Yep.  I think Sam is trying to sabotage our good times.  Sam, what are you doing?  Oh, you set up E-Rock, didn't you?  And for those of you who do not know, Sam is the voice of Toby.  Yes.  Thanks for just wandering around today.  There's a certain cast member on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:42:30]  All right, say no more.  Who likes bits.  Who likes getting people.  You might have heard him on the show earlier.  And he slightly encouraged me to.  Who would do such a thing?  I don't reveal names, but he did.  You will keep your hands.  Damn it.  Dick.  He did encourage me to maybe help.  Throw E-Rock under buses.  Maybe.  Hey, it's boss. 
[04:43:00]  Okay, I think we get it.  I think that sounds like him, yeah.  It's a smart thing to play with.  I didn't play it.  That's, no, no, no, no.  That's E-Rock.  That's E-Rock.  That's E-Rock.  That's E-Rock.  Yeah.  It's E-Rock, everybody.  With E-Rock Radio here.  It's E-Rock.  W-E-R-K.  E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock.  All right, Mark.  Mark, how much time do you have left?  We've got about 40 seconds left, so we do not have time.  Let's take that last request, then.  Oh, yeah.  Considering every request is wrong. 
[04:43:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  I blame E-Rock.  It's E-Rock.  We'll just do this.  That's bad.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  What medication is that?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  You've only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Okay, go with me.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  I'm going to have you lie down over here. 
[04:44:00]  I hate this place.  And then we'll get you some medication, okay?  The medications don't work.  We're going to get a new stretcher.  We're going to get a new stretcher.  All right, I'm here. </pre>
