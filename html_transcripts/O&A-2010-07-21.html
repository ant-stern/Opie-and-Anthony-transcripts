<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a raucous discussion centered on Lindsay Lohan's jail sentence, her mugshot, and the hosts' general apathy towards her.  They shared profane and sexually suggestive comments, recounting a negative encounter with Lohan where she refused a photo with a fan.  This segued into a broader discussion of celebrities refusing photos, with anecdotes about Jane Seymour, Pauly Shore, and Bill Maher.  Caller Jackie contributed to the Jane Seymour discussion, clarifying aspects of her career timeline. The hosts also speculated on Lohan's potential withdrawal symptoms in jail and debated whether her death would be considered a tragedy. They discussed a website featuring "duck face" photos, comparing them to "O-Faces" and "Guitar Faces" from other websites. A digression into the website "meatspin.com" occurred, before the conversation returned to celebrities, including Hal Linden and Jason Werth (whom the hosts' brother-in-law dislikes).  The hosts also mentioned smelling Lohan's seat after a prior studio appearance.

The show continued with a discussion about a negative encounter with baseball player Jason Werth, who refused photos. This sparked reminiscing about various celebrities, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Rebecca DeMornay, Bridget Fonda, and Phoebe Cates. A caller recounted a recent incident with Werth at a baseball game. The conversation then shifted to Netflix, followed by an extended discussion of Phoebe Cates' aging and nudity in *Paradise* and *Swimming Pool*, referencing images from these films and the website Mr. Skin.  A caller detailed a severe case of flatulence after eating lean beef chili and arugula salad. The show then delved into parenthood, with graphic descriptions of baby bowel movements and diaper changing.  Audio bits featuring remixed Mel Gibson and Christian Bale audio, and a comedic Popeye skit, were played.  The segment concluded with more discussions about celebrity nudity and parenthood.  Scheduled guests Bob Kelly and Mark Maron were mentioned as appearing later.


The next segment began with a discussion of acid reflux and medication. One host shared a childhood anecdote about his mother's unusual living arrangements, followed by a story about setting himself on fire while wearing feety pajamas.  The conversation meandered through underwear preferences, potential penis-zipper mishaps, and the host's low calcium levels and osteoporosis.  The segment included graphic descriptions of bodily functions and sexual experiences, along with vulgar comments.  Caller Trevor from Arizona was briefly mentioned regarding the host’s health.  Studio guests Bob Kelly and Mark Maron appeared. Kelly promoted his upcoming shows, discussed smoking cessation and relapse, and recounted his experience with a strong Swedish chewing tobacco called "snooze" or possibly "rape". A heated exchange between the hosts and Kelly ensued, with insults and accusations. The segment concluded with reminiscences about childhood pornography and graphic descriptions of early sexual experiences, followed by searching for old ex-girlfriends on Facebook.


The show then focused heavily on Anthony's dating life, particularly his relationships with significantly younger women. He recounted a high school reunion with an 18-year-old date and discussed his current relationship with a 27-year-old woman, including a text message containing a picture of her genitals. He shared anecdotes about strippers, a dominatrix, and his difficulties with emotional investment in relationships.  Danny, a tech-savvy individual, used background checks to provide information and images of Anthony's ex-girlfriends. This led to a discussion on the ease of obtaining such information. Anthony also recounted a fan visiting his home and his subsequent background check on the individual. The conversation covered Anthony's gun ownership, self-defense, and carrying firearms.  The segment included a heated argument with heavily offensive and misogynistic language,  and plugs for Mark Maron and Bob Kelly's appearances.


The final segment featured Mark Maron and Bob Kelly. Maron discussed his stand-up comedy career, including a disastrous gig in Australia that led to a nervous breakdown. He contrasted this with his current happiness and preference for performing in rock clubs.  Kelly shared a harrowing story about a near-violent confrontation with an MC at an upstate New York club run by a gangster.  The conversation briefly touched upon the Mel Gibson and Oksana Grigorieva scandal, specifically the “cigarette incident” involving Gibson’s son. Maron's stream of consciousness thoughts, revealing his anxieties and internal struggles, were interspersed with a comedic Mel Gibson/Lamb of God remix.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to stand.  Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio.  Both hosts, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie.  On the commercial team.  Opie and Anthony are apologizing for yet another approach.  Comment profanity link.  Is this the last straw for the Rocky Radio Bureau?  Yee-haw!  Yeah!  Come on.  Bring it on.  You know what?  I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on Satellite Radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about. 
[00:00:30]  You're a no-good son of a bitch.  Bob, you motherfucking...  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine.  Whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on.  It's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I just can't get enough of the George Wendt and the intro to the O.P. and Anthony show.  That is so bad.  Well, if you're giving me the hook, fine. 
[00:01:00]  Fine.  Just angry and drunk.  I wish you were there that day because it was just one of those weird...  Ah, we did this break yesterday.  It was just weird.  It's one of those things that I'm kind of glad I wasn't.  Nah, I think you would have enjoyed it because we weren't.  It sounded really uncomfortable.  It was uncomfortable, but I know what you're talking about.  The days where I make it really uncomfortable for everybody and it's awkward.  This wasn't one of those days.  It was just weird. 
[00:01:30]  It was weird uncomfortable because we couldn't figure them out.  That's just it.  I would have been sitting here like, oh, God, I don't know what to say to this.  Oh, yeah.  In that way, I guess.  But I wasn't pushing his buttons.  I mean, that would have been an easy one.  Yeah.  As far as pushing someone's buttons.  No, just uncomfortable, like the whole situation.  Yeah.  I was just intrigued by him.  Intrigued.  I was just trying to figure him out.  Like, is he a happy guy?  Didn't sound like it.  No.  No.  I don't know.  It's great having him in the opener, though.  I'm going to have to do more research on that. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Good morning.  What's up, man?  Good morning, everybody.  Anything up?  No, not really.  That's the same old shit.  Same old shit.  I'm just like, yeah.  Same old fucked commute in.  Uh-huh.  The goddamn Wednesday, which is garbage day, which means the garbage truck drivers and the  cab drivers could all fucking burn in a pile of molten steel.  Oh.  It's just annoying.  They're all zigzagging across six lanes of traffic.  And you're trying to make your way up the middle. 
[00:02:30]  Enough.  It makes just going straight really tough.  It's just annoying.  And the lights are turning red.  And no one's moving.  Yeah.  Ugh.  You got cops.  You got cabbies coming, flying in because they want a fare.  Yeah.  On the left side of the road.  They start on the right side.  And I'm like, fuck them.  You know why?  Because a lot of times, any time I need a cab, they're all off duty.  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  And then when they're on duty, they're zigzagging, trying to get the one fare that's on the side  of the road.  No.  Now you wait for me. 
[00:03:00]  That's true.  I mean, you wait.  Now you wait for me, motherfucker.  Good point.  Ah, go.  Ah.  Grr.  Hey, the big news.  Lindsay Lohan's going to jail.  And she's hurting.  And I think we should all.  Is she hurting?  Take this very, very seriously.  Is she hurting?  She's fucking broad.  Fucking broad.  She's fascinated with it.  I don't know.  Are people fascinated by it?  I don't think so, man.  I think they're too fascinated by it.  Really?  Yeah.  Like who?  I don't know. 
[00:03:30]  The news is picking up on it.  It's on all the websites, like the gossip websites.  I saw something yesterday I thought I would never see on MSNBC on one of the big cable  news outlets.  Yeah.  MSNBC, CNN, and Fox.  And I watch all three.  I really do.  But some dude was filling in for, I think it was Keith Oberman.  Because I watch Keith Oberman almost every night to be mad.  And not because I don't agree with what he's saying.  I probably would agree with what he's saying more than, let's say, a Sean Hannity. 
[00:04:00]  Probably.  Yeah.  Not that I care that much.  But I like watching him because he's such a douchebag.  He annoys you?  Do you do that?  Do you watch people because they're douchebags?  I've absolutely watched shows because the person annoys me.  And I don't know why.  Just sit there and go, ugh.  Yeah, exactly.  So some guy was filling in.  And he goes up next.  How did he say it?  Fuck, I wish I had the clip.  But basically he said, I'm doing this for you people because I don't care. 
[00:04:30]  More or less, that's what he said.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah.  Because he had to do a whole Lindsay Lohan thing because that's a big news story.  But for the first time, I saw a news guy actually go, you know what?  I don't give a crap about this stupid broad, but I have to do this for you.  You think they're doing that?  You think they're really doing that?  Or do they realize, look, people kind of want to hear what's going on with their gossipy,  bunch of gossip girdies?  And he's just saying that to try to keep a bit of his credibility?  I kind of believed him. 
[00:05:00]  Because I think I actually heard somebody do that on Fox News also.  As well.  Who was it?  O'Reilly.  O'Reilly actually did it.  Because he had gotten, you know how he reads the emails and shit?  Yeah.  And somebody had said, I don't care about Lindsay Lohan.  What kind of show do you have?  I didn't think you were running like a gossip show.  And he kind of made the statement like, well, you know, it's in the news and I had to report it.  Right.  But obviously.  Had to report.  It was different from this guy looking right into the camera and saying, I don't care about this. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm doing it for you as he's looking.  And I'm looking around.  Is he doing it for me?  Because he's looking right at me.  For me?  I think the TV's talking to me.  This is a little weird.  But now, the Lindsay Lohan thing.  She had to do 90 days.  Then it was knocked down at 23 days.  Do you know why it was knocked down at 23 days?  Because she's famous?  Was it a famous thing?  Because she's scared of the bull dykes in the jail?  Or nothing means what it means? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  90 days actually means you've got to get some kind of translation.  90 days actually means 24 days.  Then why don't you just say 24, 23 days?  Yeah, I don't get that either.  Because 90 days is actually 23 days, we're learning.  And now we're learning that it's two weeks.  Two weeks.  So all of a sudden, her 90 days in jail, three months, is down to two lousy fucking weeks.  And she won't even serve them.  Because of overcrowding in the jail system in California.  That's why. 
[00:06:30]  They don't need her in there, so she's doing two weeks.  You think if she was just some sister that got tased coming out of her car, that this would even be an issue?  Or she'd be in jail already?  Oh, of course.  Just serving the entire time?  Yeah.  Every single day of the night.  Yeah, exactly.  But good news, Anthony.  She's doing very well in jail.  Her first night was spent very comfortably.  Oh, that's good.  She's in a fucking room for two weeks.  It says she's served less than 12 days. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, now it's less than 12 days?  Look, look.  Now it's down to less than 12 days?  Is it less than 12 days, 11 days, or less?  Yeah, now we could call it.  It's about 11 days.  Her 90 days.  Look, it's all over the fucking news.  Yeah, she's going to be in a room for 11 days.  Who cares?  Yeah, she's not going to be getting raped with a fucking broom handle.  Our angle is, who gives a shit?  And then she...  Yeah, she does.  And then she gets out of jail, and they're saying she'll make at least a million dollars off this experience. 
[00:07:30]  How is that?  Like a book or something?  I'm not really sure, because...  Yeah, how do you capitalize on that?  I kind of scan all these fucking articles, you know.  For you people.  Just for you people.  We're just going to make about a million dollars.  She looks all right in that mugshot.  She's got her prison garb on, her little orange jumpsuit, and it's almost a low-cut neckline thing happening there.  She's got her blonde hair. 
[00:08:00]  She's got eye makeup on.  What the fuck is going on?  What's going on in jail?  Well, this is important.  If you're going to get a mugshot, you've got to do it the right way.  You've got to look good?  Yeah.  I'm sure her PR people set it up all nice.  Make sure you have makeup on.  Make sure you do this look.  Blah, blah, blah.  Looks like a photo shoot.  Got like a background and lighting.  Yeah.  The whole family's dysfunctional.  It came out yesterday.  The mom will only go on TV to talk about her own daughter for $50,000.  That's her price tag.  If you want me talking about my own daughter on TV, $50,000. 
[00:08:30]  And then the father's running around trying to get on as many fucking TV shows as possible.  Is it one of those deals where it's really obviously the parent's fault that she's so fucked up?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never spent a day with any of these people, obviously.  Yeah.  We met Lindsay Lohan once.  Yeah.  That was just before whatever she started doing.  It was almost like during it.  I think we had heard stories about... 
[00:09:00]  Rumblings, as they like to say?  Yeah, yeah.  Rumblings about cocaine and drinking and stuff.  And she came into the studio when we were over at the other building.  And she was very aloof.  Very aloof.  Because we all wanted pictures with her.  I didn't.  No?  And I'm proud to say that.  Are you being like the news guy?  I did it for you.  I like getting pictures with people.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I don't.  But for some reason, I just didn't want a picture with her.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is that the dreamy one with Iroch? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Is that the dreamy picture with Iroch?  No, that's Paris Hilton.  Paris Hilton was you and your dreamy picture.  Oh, with Iroch's bedroom eyes.  His bedroom eyes.  He's holding it like, yeah, this is my chick.  Iroch, you got to tweet that today so everyone can see your bedroom eyes.  Iroch's bedroom eyes.  His heavy eyelids.  He's holding it like they're on a date.  Yeah.  Oh, Iroch.  It was your Paris Hilton photo.  Oh! 
[00:10:00]  Hey!  Oh!  Actually, I didn't get one.  I would have got a picture with Paris Hilton.  I'm not saying I...  I would have, too.  But that day, I just didn't...  I didn't care about her.  Now I wish I had it.  But I'm, you know...  I did.  Like, I wanted a picture with her and stuff.  But she was really, like, kind of snotty.  It wasn't...  You know how some people come in and they're kind of like, oh, yeah, come on, take a picture.  It's okay.  But she was just kind of standing there like, oh, I want more Coke.  Just stop.  Snap the picture quick.  Remember, we also had to give up our office for her? 
[00:10:30]  Yes.  Because she had to have a place to sit before she did that interview with 20 on 20.  Yeah, yeah.  So we had to give up our office.  And then we all ran in and started smelling the seats.  A bunch of fucking pigs.  I think Jimmy has some photos of that.  Of him smelling the seat.  Yeah.  I remember that one.  It all ran in after she left.  All right, let's sniff the seats.  No, she's just a twat.  I mean, my experience with her, my wife was walking through Central Park with one of our,  I guess, technically, like a niece. 
[00:11:00]  It's like my sister's niece, but you know how that all works, right?  Sure.  And this girl couldn't have been more than 11 at the time.  She was in the Lindsay Lohan wheelhouse, as far as a fan goes.  She was a tween at the time.  A tween.  And they're walking through Central Park just doing something else.  And all of a sudden, there's Lindsay Lohan on a park bench doing nothing.  Just sitting there alone?  Sitting there alone.  Pondering?  Feeding the pigeons?  She was doing that movie about Mark David Chapman. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, right, yeah.  At the Dakota.  So she was in the park just kind of going over.  She wasn't even going over lines.  Well, maybe she was going over lines.  And my wife and the little niece there, you know, walk up and go, can we get a picture?  Dude, there was nobody around.  It was just one of those weird situations where they came upon Lindsay Lohan.  Yeah.  And there was nobody around.  No paparazzi.  No other fans.  No other people really in the park noticed. 
[00:12:00]  And she fucking said no.  And then the bodyguard had to get involved to kind of push them out of the way.  She wouldn't take a picture with a tween.  One lousy fucking picture.  She would just slid on the bench and snap the picture and get up.  That's the life you chose.  Well, or your parents chose, right?  Yeah.  She was kind of thrust into it.  You take the one lousy fucking picture.  Who gives a shit?  She's got to go to rehab after this little stint, right?  For 90 days.  Yeah.  I'm thinking that she needs to get out of jail immediately because of maybe some withdrawals 
[00:12:30]  that are going to happen in the next few days.  I think she's going to be laying all sweaty in her fucking cot.  Just moaning and fucking getting the DTs.  How hot is that?  Oh, that's too hot.  How hot is that?  A little sweaty.  With her sheets twisted around her legs.  A little sweaty.  Yum.  And she could only take a shower every other day.  But she's only going to be in there 11 days, right?  Is that her right there? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, she takes a fucking ridiculously good picture.  Yeah.  She's got a real nice set.  She does have some cans on her.  Some cans.  That was her Marilyn Monroe kind of pictorial she did.  She looks a little beyond her years.  Like, she's getting a little weathered.  I guess she's only 23 or 24.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah, she's really being ridden hard and put up wet these days. 
[00:13:30]  Maybe she'll figure it out.  If not, oh well.  The duck lip thing is just so obvious and so bad.  When will chicks realize that's not a good fucking look?  If you don't have the big fucking lips, oh well.  They haven't figured out how to fucking puff up your lips and not look ridiculous.  I think the problem is you could do it one time, get a little plumpness going.  I don't know.  I'm guessing. 
[00:14:00]  I don't even think they could do it one time.  But they just keep going after that.  It's just this dumb fucking duck look and it looks horrid.  I completely agree with you.  And it's really obvious.  It's not sexy looking.  You just look stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm doing it for Anthony.  I wish it was TV.  I hope he's doing that.  And that's them just not doing anything with their face.  I'm trying.  Try it at home.  Try it at home.  Do your duck lips.  Put your lips out. 
[00:14:30]  My lips look juicy and voluptuous.  It's like you were punched.  Oh no, there's a duck face fucking website.  Is there really?  Well, there's a couple things.  Girls have learned to push out their lips.  When they take pictures.  This is a great site.  It's just chicks and dumb assholes puffing their lips out.  You know what?  It's funny that we're on this website because I was discussing with my girl. 
[00:15:00]  When I say my girl, my wife, but wife just sounds...  Yeah.  I don't like...  I never liked the word wife.  But I told her I never really liked the wow pictures we got over the years.  Yeah.  For one reason.  Because the girls always had to make that face.  I call it like a...  Whenever girls flash their tits, they got to go like...  Like make some weird fucking face.  Like some guy really getting into playing guitar. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  You want to see him topless, but you want to see some kind of normal face.  Yeah.  Maybe a look of like, you like these, but it's always like...  I'm partying.  Tongues out.  Lips are fucking perched.  A lot of times over the years, we've seen the wow shots with like the cigarette hanging  out of their mouth because they had to like, you know, they needed both their hands to  lift up their shirt.  And the smoke is going into one eye, so it's shut.  So it's shut like Popeye.  I go, you know what? 
[00:16:00]  I never really dug a lot of the fucking shots we got over the years.  Kevin from Connecticut calls it Jimmy Page Face.  Jimmy Page Face.  Very good.  It's like when your fucking Carlos Santana face, you'll make this like a guy engrossed  in a heavy fucking lead.  Danny, you got a website that shows that off?  I betcha.  It's Guitar Face or O-Face?  Oh, there's actually a...  Guitar Face or O-Face.  So they just show the face, and it's either somebody coming...  Or playing guitar.  Yeah, fucking or playing guitar. 
[00:16:30]  That's hysterical.  Is that...  That's guitar.  Yeah, of course.  We saw that at Mardi Gras a lot, too, when the girl's like, they can't just flash in  a sexy way.  It's always got to be some kind of weird, like, blah, party face, or a tongue has to  stick out.  It's a woo.  It's a woo face.  Woo face.  Woo.  My O-Face.  Oh.  Carlos Santana makes the worst faces.  That's got to be porn, right?  Yeah.  But they all look the same. 
[00:17:00]  That's a pretty good sight.  It's funny.  Shit.  Guitar Face or O-Face?  Oh.  That's Courtney Love, of course.  My O-Face.  Fucking A.  So that's the big story that everybody will be covering today.  Yes.  Would you give a shit if she, like, I don't know, dropped dead?  Uh, not in a I'm feeling bad kind of way.  But, you know, it would be one of those, oh, well, there's another young Hollywood starlet. 
[00:17:30]  When will they learn?  And then a news reporter.  Yeah.  When will they learn?  And, but the thing is, all these anchors and everybody that, that have been goofing on  her and being like, oh, here she is again, this dumb fucking whore, sending her to jail.  If she did die, they'd be like, and tragedy in Hollywood is another young star.  Tragedy?  They would.  You know the news.  Tragedy would be.  Tragedy.  If Justin Bieber was in a, in a, in a, in a car crash.  You're, you're, you're tying yourself up here. 
[00:18:00]  What?  What?  Is that a tragedy, really?  Well, I, I know it's a little, little Justin Bieber.  No, I'm not a fan of Justin Bieber, but I guess the point I'm trying to make, someone  that you didn't expect all of a sudden dies in some horrific way.  That's a tragedy.  But if Lindsay Lohan shows up dead somewhere, is that really a tragedy?  Or, oh, okay, we all expected this to happen.  One of those misguided youth kind of tragedies.  Oh, I guess.  Yeah, one of those.  You know.  I guess.  Whenever those Hollywood starlets are found in a hotel room, fucking dead.  She has the world by the balls. 
[00:18:30]  Figure it out.  And, and everyone on TV last night, she's a very talented actress.  Oh, is that what they're saying?  That's what's so sad about this.  She seems quite the, the cunt, to be honest.  Really?  She seems quite the cunt.  Even when she was in that day.  I was like, come on.  Well, like I said, my experience, or my, my girl's experience, wasn't, wasn't pretty.  It was really awkward for everybody.  It's like, really?  Like, no?  Yeah.  You can't say no to a picture from a fan.  Unless you're really, really busy or in the middle of something crazy. 
[00:19:00]  That's why I, I rarely take pictures with people.  And when I went to take a picture with her, I hate that feeling like I'm bothering her.  Like, all right, fucking forget it.  Nah, bothering is if there were a thousand people waiting for pictures and you're sitting  there waiting for your picture.  You know what I mean?  One picture and she's fucking bothered.  One picture where, where you know it's not going to lead to any other pictures.  Twat.  And Jane Seymour is a, a cunt.  Yeah?  I haven't forgotten.  Jane Seymour.  I will never.  Blew you off. 
[00:19:30]  No, blew off my mom.  Oh.  And I don't have the greatest relationship with my mom, but.  Really?  Yeah, we were, where the fuck were we?  I think we were going to see Phil Donahue.  Oh, Jesus.  I was a little nothing.  We used to come in from Long Island to go to the TV tapings.  And Dr. Quinn, medicine woman, fucking flew you off.  Somehow, like, after the Phil Donahue, you know, you all go down together, the studio  audience and big, huge, you know, 80 people to an elevator.  And somehow, I don't know, we were at the end of the line or something and we got an elevator 
[00:20:00]  pretty much by ourselves.  And then it stopped on another floor and Jane Seymour walks in and my mom's like, I love  medicine woman.  She's whispering to me like, that's, that's the medicine.  And, and I'm like, I'm a, I'm a nothing.  So my mom, I go, I go, ask her for a picture.  I got, I got the camera, you know.  Would you have your Kodak film camera?  God, I forgot.  Your Instamatic?  Something.  So my mom taps her on the, on the arm. 
[00:20:30]  There's no one else in the elevator, really.  Maybe a couple of her people.  Goes, uh, I'm a big fan.  Can I have a picture?  And my mom, you know, isn't the type of person that's brave enough to do any of this, but  I, I talked her into it.  Yeah.  And Jane Seymour turns around and goes, no.  Like rudely too.  No.  Wow.  And now we have to awkwardly go down to the, the fucking lobby with this.  With her and the people that saw.  Yeah.  And me and my mom are in shock.  Like she, she, she said no. 
[00:21:00]  She said no.  This is her life.  Fuck you, Dr. Quinn.  This is your life.  You chose this to be in the public eye.  She said, fuck, you know, that cunt.  You should get cancer.  You should only get cancer.  That's right.  To this day, every time I see her, I, I, I, I seethe.  Yes.  I seethe.  People just don't deal with it well.  I don't know what that is.  Just fucking deal with it.  Look, man.  I mean, some people, obviously, they can't even go out. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  There's somebody that cannot leave their house.  But they chose that as well.  It's an easy life.  What we have is an easy life.  We joke about the hours and this and that, but it's an easy life.  Yeah.  How hard is it to take a picture with somebody?  Well, that's why.  We, it's not like, like, you got to figure somebody like Tom Cruise cannot fucking leave  his house without constantly being barraged with requests for photos and, uh, right.  And pictures.  But Dr. Quinn medicine woman.  Well, she was pretty big at the time.  Was she big at the time? 
[00:22:00]  But, but we're in the elevator isolated.  Like the elevator doors are going to open up.  No one's going to know.  She took a fucking picture with my mom in the elevator.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They should be, they should kind of take into consideration where, where they are.  That's what I'm saying about Lindsay Lohan as well in the park.  No one was around.  It wasn't going to, it wasn't going to create a fucking frenzy.  A Lohan.  Turned into a paparazzi frenzy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It is an odd thing.  I don't know what side I'm on as far as that goes.  Really? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  We've taken thousands and thousands and thousands of pictures.  I can't, I know, but I can walk down the street without being bothered or anything.  It's, it's not like a, it's just a constant barrage.  Dude.  I, I, well, yeah, we have different lives because I walk around the city a lot.  I get, I get recognized every day.  Yeah.  I love it.  I fucking love it.  I'm not going to sit here and say I hate it.  I love it.  Yeah.  Stop, say hi.  We talk, you know, sometimes I talk for a couple minutes, whatever.  Sometimes it's a, Hey, can I get a picture?  I love that shit.  Always cordial.  So what's the problem? 
[00:23:00]  You don't want to be the asshole guy, but what's the problem with that?  You said you're on the fence.  Well, if you get somebody like a, like a Tom Cruise, a big A-lister, Arnold Schwarzenegger,  it's got to be constant.  It's got to just be a constant.  Like if you can't walk three feet down a sidewalk without constantly being told, can I get a picture  or could I, could you sign this?  You wouldn't be able to get anywhere.  I got a solution.  Yeah.  Make a shitty movie.  Is that how you get out of it? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Make one shitty movie.  You get a little more room out there.  Get a little breathing room.  Right.  Yeah.  I made a breathing room movie.  I want to go to a website.  Maybe someone could help me.  I want to, I want to go to a website of people that used to be famous that probably even had  the problem you're mentioning.  Yeah.  And now I want to go to a website where you go, holy shit, remember that person?  And they were probably completely bothered all the time.  Right.  And now there's got to be one website that is dedicated to the holy shit, remember that 
[00:24:00]  person.  So you can't even think of, I bet you can't even name one of those people.  You know what I mean?  You know, someone that used to be so famous, famous, you know, who was very fit.  Now, now this is, I'm just throwing out a starter here.  This is a starter.  And then afterwards we could go, oh, that's a better one.  But you know who was fucking huge at one point in his career and now is nowhere?  Pauly Shore.  Oh, Pauly Shore.  Pauly Shore was, but he was, but remember the whole MTV thing and he was in fucking movies. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, Pauly Shore was a fucking huge name.  When you mentioned Pauly Shore, I know I'm evil.  I know I'm fucking the devil.  I'm not fucking the devil.  I am the fucking devil.  Yeah.  Because, uh, finish.  No, that was pretty much it.  I apologize.  I think Pauly Shore is one of those that was huge a few years ago.  It's one of my favorite moments doing radio with you.  Oh, God.  Was that awful? 
[00:25:00]  Me and Ants, this is new listeners, so fuck it.  Uh, we start out, do an afternoon drive together.  We've, we've barely done radio together at this point.  And, uh, we go out to LA and we were absolutely, we'll be the first to admit, really green and trying to find it and find our way.  We had potential, but no one gave a shit about us.  Yeah.  We didn't have an audience yet.  And they fly us out to LA and we're, we're, we're speaking to some big stars of the day.  And Pauly Shore was one of those people.  Yeah.  He was the biggest fucking prick to us.  Just an asshole. 
[00:25:30]  He was just a real big asshole.  Not even in a good way where he's like, oh, you guys are new and just kind of going with it.  He was a real fucking prick, like he was an A-lister, right?  Yeah.  And maybe he was sort of an A-lister at the time.  You fast forward about, what, six, seven years where at N.E.W. on top of our fucking game and Pauly Shore comes in and he's no longer anywhere near an A-lister.  Yeah.  And he's bombing so bad on our show.  And he actually looks at me like, hey, man, help me out here. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, help me out.  Because, I mean, a little secret, if we feel like it, we can help out people.  That are kind of, yeah, teetering and bombing.  Yeah, we could carry people if we like them.  You've probably heard it over the years.  You know, someone's kind of having a rough appearance.  There's a way of helping that person and carrying them to the finish line.  He gives me the look like, hey, man, help me out over here.  And I just looked at him and gave him a smile like, this is payback, motherfucker.  Hung out to dry, fuck.  That's right.  And I don't think he's ever been on the show again.  Yeah, no, he hasn't. 
[00:26:30]  Fuck him.  Oh, God, great picture.  Oh, that's a picture from his heyday.  God damn.  Was that ever a look?  Yeah.  What the fuck is going on?  Yeah, the ripped jean shorts.  Ripped jean shorts that look like fucking Daisy Dukes he's wearing.  Eight layers of different colored things he's wearing.  And a headband.  That was his head, buddy.  That whole character.  Ugh.  Hey, there's a website, maybe.  The Weasel.  Oh, shut up.  He was the Weasel. 
[00:27:00]  But it was huge.  You guys don't Weasel the juice?  No, Weasel the juice.  What the hell is that?  What's wrong with you guys?  Weasel the juice.  Oh, you've got to Weasel the juice.  Oh, good.  What a tool.  I got a website where celebrities used to be big.  Go to Die?  Is there a website?  Yeah.  There's a website for meatspin.com.  Oh, meatspin.  Yeah, go to meatspin.com.  Oh, damn it!  No, what happened? 
[00:27:30]  But it was supposed to be celebrities.  And it's just a cock spinning around and around.  Damn it.  Look, it's counting the spins.  Do you realize that cock is somewhere spinning forever on the internet?  Like, somewhere, it's never not on.  Yes, I'll go with that.  So for all the internet users in the world, there's one machine somewhere at any given  time that meatspin is on.  That meatspin is spinning on.  That cock has just been spinning and spinning. 
[00:28:00]  Who's the gayer guy in that fucking video?  I would say the guy taking it in the ass.  Guy taking it in the ass is always the gayer of the two.  The gayer of the two.  The guy fucking is just putting it in a hole.  Yeah, yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  You can't fault him.  Where are they now?  Yes.  Where are they now, .com, possibly?  Yeah.  Oh, is there a whatever happened to?  W-E-H-T.net? 
[00:28:30]  If it's a .net, it's going to get closed down in a second.  Those .nets don't quite have the juice.  No.  The .coms do.  Few people get on the .net and it's over.  Ever wonder what happened to Eddie the Eagle, the chick who shot Andy Warhol, that Mikey  kid.  I don't really get Gary Coleman.  We all know where he is.  Yeah, I want . . .  Noriega, Dixie Carlton.  These are dead people. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Oh, this site sucks.  This site blows.  Yeah, I don't like that site.  Hey, thanks for the site, asshole.  It blew.  Now people are doing their Pauly Shore impressions on instant feedback.  He's a . . .  He's a . . .  Let's see.  Let me read some names here.  Renee Zellweger.  She's still around.  Now, she's still there.  She's still there.  Yeah, Renee's still around.  Is that the Billy Zab . . .  Is that the blonde kid from Karate Kid?  He's . . . 
[00:29:30]  Like, he was huge.  Ralph Macchio.  Let's see Ralph Macchio.  He . . .  He . . .  He couldn't walk down the street during the Karate Kid days.  Well, he made a comeback on Funny or Die recently.  Yeah, but not to the point where . . .  He made fun of himself because of the whole Karate Kid movie.  I think Ralph Macchio can walk down the street with nary a problem.  That's true.  But I think during the Karate Kid days, he couldn't move.  He couldn't get . . .  He can't get arrested now?  How does that go again?  He can't get arrested.  Yeah, Ralph Macchio was . . . 
[00:30:00]  He was a biggie.  Yeah.  Another one.  C. Thomas Howell.  What?  Remember him?  C. Thomas Howell.  C. Thomas Howell.  Who the fuck is he?  He was huge back in, like, the Red Dawn day.  He was in Red Dawn.  He was in . . .  That guy, C. Thomas Howell?  Yeah.  He was in . . .  I loved that movie.  What the fuck was it called again?  Because I had a . . .  He was the black guy.  I had a huge crush on Ray Dawn Chong.  Wow.  You scared me for a second. 
[00:30:30]  I said Ray Dawn Chong.  C. Thomas Howell.  What movie was that?  I've got to look it up.  I forgot the name of the movie.  I can't remember either.  That was Soul Man.  Soul Man.  Soul Man.  I think I liked Soul Man at one point.  He wanted a scholarship.  Yeah.  But they were giving him out to black people, so he made like he was a black guy.  Yeah.  Make that movie now.  That ain't happening.  Blackface.  He did the whole movie in blackface.  Wow.  That's a good one, Ant.  C. Thomas Howell.  Or I think any of the people from Rumblefish.  Or what was the other one? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, the . . .  The Outsiders.  I got one.  And he made a slight comeback, but the E.T. kid.  Ah, right.  The boy.  Yeah, but he did kind of . . .  I think he was in Legends of the Fall, I think, as one of the brothers or something.  Yeah, he kind of made a comeback.  And then went away again.  Henry Thomas.  Henry Thomas was pretty fucking huge.  I think . . .  As the E.T. kid.  What was the last thing he did?  Henry Thomas.  Take a little look-see.  That, like, anybody knows.  Well, he's still doing shit, but . . . 
[00:31:30]  Did an episode of CSI.  Oh, see, Bob Kelly does that.  A little without a trace.  No offense, Bob Kelly.  You're a good actor.  Bob Kelly coming in soon.  What was the biggest thing he did?  Yeah, what was the last really good thing he did?  Gangs of New York.  He was in Gangs of New York?  Yeah, yeah, he was.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know what?  I never saw that stupid movie.  Suicide Kings.  Suicide Kings was great.  Yeah.  Yeah, Legends of the Fall.  Psycho 4, the beginning.  Gangs of New York was good.  I know it was.  I really wanted to see that movie. 
[00:32:00]  It was just one of those movies.  It fell through the cracks.  I haven't seen it yet.  That DiCaprio was great.  Oh, fuck, man.  Jackie in Jersey.  Jackie.  Hello, Opie.  Good to see you again.  Hi, Jackie.  I think Jackie's coming in soon.  Yeah.  I can come in today if you want.  I don't care.  Not you.  Oh, this is the other Jackie.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wait, this is the Jackie that we actually invited in.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Oh.  Yeah, but the creepy thing is when you pick up the phone, he says, Opie, good to see you again.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Are you following me? 
[00:32:30]  I apologize.  Ghoul.  I got another person following me.  Are you following me?  No, I'm not following him.  All right.  What do you got?  I'm confused about the whole Jane Seymour thing.  Dr. Quinn didn't come on until the 90s.  So what was she famous for?  Like when you saw her when you were 11?  Like why was she such a big deal?  I swear to God, I thought I was a little kid.  But then again, when I was in college, I still felt like I was a little kid.  Dr. Quinn came on in the 90s?  Yeah, it premiered in 1993, it says.  Didn't she do Soap on?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I definitely will go on record and say that my mom got blown off by Jane Seymour way before 
[00:33:00]  93.  So what was she doing before that?  She was a Bond girl.  Nah, my mom knew her from something.  Okay.  Medicine Woman came on in 93, are you sure, or did it go off the air in 93?  No, it came on in 93, according to...  Oh, fuck.  Okay, well, now we've got to figure this out.  Let's say she was in soap operas, wasn't she, or something?  Well, my mom was, I guess...  What the hell was she into?  My mom did, like, soap operas, but...  War and Remembrance, the TV miniseries.  Well, Jackie, help us out, you fuck. 
[00:33:30]  You do the research.  Yeah, you cock-sock-a.  Did she have...  Was she a Bond fan?  She was a Bond fan.  Was it...  It had to be another series, Jackie.  I don't know what she...  I think she was just in movies and stuff.  I don't think she was in another...  I don't think she was a star of any...  God, no.  Yeah, she did a lot of TV movies.  Yeah, I'm telling you, it was a medicine woman then.  She did.  She was like the TV movie queen.  Because I don't think Phil Donahue was still doing his thing in 93.  She was in a miniseries called East of Eden.  Was that popular back then?  Yeah.  The miniseries was a huge thing back in the day. 
[00:34:00]  That's true.  Back in what we call the day.  Before, you really had a lot of channels.  I mean, I could...  I might have been in college, maybe.  Oh, now you're jacking the fucking age up.  Early college years, though.  Yeah.  I did a solid five, so...  But that's a big difference in being 11.  You know what I'm saying?  Did I say 11 even?  It was a child prodigy.  I said I was in college at 11.  I think I drove everybody in, so I wasn't that young, but...  I was young.  Look at this fucking literal Jackie. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, you're an asshole, man.  You're doing math.  This is a dumb little memory in the back of my head I didn't even think I was going to talk about today.  I know.  I just met you with a little Opie, you know, going to the big city, going to watch Phil Donahue.  We were obsessed with the TV taping, our family.  Really?  You liked going to the TV tapings?  Did a lot of Phil Donahue's.  Did some Sally.  You did Sally Jessie?  Did Sally Jessie.  Did Montel Williams, which is really weird because he lives in my building now.  Oh, really?  I fucking told him I used to come in the city to watch his show. 
[00:35:00]  He was a real jerk.  I'll tell you why he was a jerk, because between the tapings, he had one lousy...  I'm sure these people are so happy that one of their audience members became pretty popular in their own right.  Because, I mean, these stories would never see the light of day.  Of course not.  But I remember sitting in the audience for Montel Williams, and during the commercial breaks, there was one assistant that had to come out with a lint brush and lint down Montel Williams. 
[00:35:30]  Like, it would make a difference.  Did it get linty?  No!  There might have been, like, one or two lousy, tiny little...  I never saw lint.  But they had to come out and de-lint him?  They had to de-lint him during every commercial break.  I never forgot that.  People are saying it's East of Eden.  It might have been the Jane Seymour thing.  So...  What show did we go...  Did we go to see a fucking show?  Like, the Daily Show or something?  We saw Bill Maher.  Bill Maher, right?  Another asshole. 
[00:36:00]  And I...  I hate to hate on him, because I kind of like Bill Maher, but he was such a fucking prick to us, too, in L.A.  He was a big forehead asshole.  He was a real jerk.  He was even more of a jerk than Paula Short.  Yeah, jerk!  But I kind of liked some of the stuff he does, so...  Wasn't that where there was, like, candy on the seat?  When you went to sit down, they were, like, handing out candy to...  Oh, are we...  Hop everybody up?  We done with Jackie?  Yeah!  All right, thanks, Jackie.  No problem, O.  Good talking to you, man.  Call us more often. 
[00:36:30]  You're just fucking terrific.  Bill Maher, it was chocolate, because they wanted to fire up the audience.  Yeah, yeah, they got to get that sugar rush.  They wanted everyone to have a sugar rush when he came out.  This artificial energy.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, I wanted to make good with Bill Maher, because I've hated him for years, but then  I saw that movie he did, Religious.  Yeah, I haven't seen that one.  I kind of liked it, and he wouldn't come in to promote the fucking movie.  I think we got the director, right? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Someone came in to promote it.  Yeah.  But we couldn't get Bill Maher.  I'm like, yeah, great, let's get Bill on the show.  You know, he's promoting this movie.  It needs all the help it could get, because it's not a big, huge Hollywood feature.  They fucking blew us off.  I'm like, this is why I hate you.  Jerk.  You're a jerk.  You're a jerk.  One of the greatest words ever.  Jerk.  Jerk.  No one really uses that anymore.  Guy's just a jerk.  My favorite words are jerk.  I love queer. 
[00:37:30]  You're queer.  I love using the word queer.  The jerk's still a cold.  A jerk could be maybe my favorite word.  Jerk.  You're just a jerk.  So you said it like Noonan said it in Caddyshack.  Yeah.  Beat it.  Jerk.  Yasmin Bleeth used to be really famous.  Yasmin Bleeth. 
[00:38:00]  Andrew McCarthy.  Wow.  He used to be huge.  Andrew McCarthy was giant.  Probably can.  He's got some breathing room.  Sure.  He's definitely got breathing room.  I think TMZ does a good feature.  Where are they now?  Yeah.  Or whatever they call it.  And then they show a picture of someone in their prime and then what they're doing now.  I can't get enough of those.  I can't get enough of those.  They did Barney Miller yesterday.  Wow.  And unrecognizable.  If you saw Barney Miller on the street, you'd walk right by him.  He's an asshole. 
[00:38:30]  Is Barney Miller an asshole?  Is he a jerk?  A couple of years.  I grew up loving Barney Miller, right?  Yeah.  It was a pretty good show, man.  And by the way, I'm sorry to jump in again here, but Fish was, Abe Vigoda was fucking  really old during Barney Miller days.  By the way, his name isn't Barney Miller.  Hal Linden.  Hal Linden.  Hal Linden.  Yes.  And he's a jerk?  He's an asshole.  What happened?  A couple of years ago, he was on the corner of 57th and 6th near the old studio. 
[00:39:00]  And I go, holy shit, it's Barney Miller.  So I go over there and ask if I could get a photo.  And he's just wearing that raincoat that they used to wear in the 70s, that beige with the  plaid inside.  The executive.  Yes, exactly.  And so I said, can I get a photo?  And he goes, no.  And then walked away.  Wow.  Sure it was him?  Positive it was him.  And why would he be such an asshole jerk? 
[00:39:30]  No idea.  What a jerk.  Say it at home.  It's fun.  I love that people are jerks today.  And you've got to slow down just slightly when you say jerk.  Guy's a jerk.  But I haven't seen a picture of him.  He's unrecognizable or the entire cast?  No, Barney Miller.  The main Barney Miller guy.  What's his name again?  Hal?  Hal Linden.  Hal Linden.  And then it was Ron Glass.  I thought it was on TMZ yesterday.  Jack Sue. 
[00:40:00]  Wojohowicz.  Because what they do is...  Wojohowicz.  Now, Wojohowicz was giant.  Was it, you think?  Dude, when Barney Miller was on, Wojohowicz could not walk the streets.  He looked a little like Joe Piscopo at the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of jacked up.  Yeah, he was jacked.  And then now, Wojohowicz can fucking do whatever he wants.  Except work in Hollywood.  How about Yahoo Serious?  Yahoo Serious. 
[00:40:30]  He was famous for about 10 minutes.  That's pretty good, though.  Yeah.  Come on.  Where's this Hal Linden picture?  I thought it was on TMZ.  Wojohowicz.  Jesus Christ.  Anthony's got to see this.  All right.  The mug shot.  So I guess they put a lot of material up yesterday.  Maybe it's further down.  Come on.  Come on.  Where are they now?  Come on.  Yeah.  Ice tea.  There you go.  Okay.  Okay.  That's him.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Would you recognize him on the street?  No.  He's got like a goatee.  He's got the wiry eyebrows.  Yeah.  That doesn't even resemble him.  He's almost 80.  No, I know.  It's a 79-year-old.  79-year-old.  That's not bad for him.  I'm not saying he looks bad, but I'm saying he doesn't look like how we remember him.  How old is he and Barney Miller?  Well, if he's 79, Barney Miller was in the 70s, I guess, right? 
[00:41:30]  So 40 years ago.  Jesus Christ.  Well, 1970s, 40 years ago.  So 30-something years ago.  So he was already kind of an older gentleman, middle-aged gentleman.  My God, man.  What's up with the eyebrow hairs that are a little too long?  When do you let it go?  Do you have a few uncles like that?  I do.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, will you just fucking trim that shit?  I'm already trimming that shit.  When do you let it go?  When do you just look and say, I see it and I'm going to do nothing about it? 
[00:42:00]  You've got a four-inch eyebrow hair where you fucking just trim it.  It's distracting.  It's really, it just bothers me.  You can't talk to people and not be distracted by certain types of facial hair.  You know who has one of those?  That fucking asshole who's not here today.  Jimmy.  Jimmy has one.  And he goes, I know, it bothers my girlfriend.  I'm like, will you just trim it?  He does it on purpose.  Jimmy has one.  He does it on purpose.  Next time you get a picture with Jimmy or whatever, look for his one lousy eyebrow hair that he refuses to trim. 
[00:42:30]  Does he trim his other eyebrow hairs and just leaves that one?  I think it's just one that decided to just continue to grow and he decided to leave it.  Leave it alone?  Much different than older guys that have a lot of them popping out.  Jimmy has one.  I like evenness.  I like, I take my, I take my finger and I push up on my eyebrows and then I take my little razor and I just go, bam, bam.  No, you gotta, you gotta. 
[00:43:00]  And that keeps everything even.  You gotta get a girl for a couple weeks.  No.  Eyebrow trimmer.  No.  Eyebrow trimmer.  No, I'm fine with it.  It's a comb that just goes.  That's frightening.  Done.  Done.  Does it frighten you the first time you're like, oh, it's going to take my entire eyebrow off?  There's only two settings.  The one setting is a little rough.  It makes you look almost like a burn victim.  The other one's okay, though.  Burn victim setting?  Yeah, burn victim setting and then normal setting.  See, because I, I, it's not like I want to trim down the entire brow, but you just don't want the full, full, the flyaways, full. 
[00:43:30]  The eyebrow trimmer.  You hear them getting caught, too.  You hear, it's a good feeling.  And then your ears and your nose and fucking trimming everything.  Just a mess.  Trimming.  But there are, there's a time where people just say, fuck it.  There's got to be one definitive day where you just look and go, I see it and I'm not going to touch it.  Anything better than an old guy that can't keep his suit together? 
[00:44:00]  Just slightly wrinkled and slightly not pressed.  And that's, that's what you're talking about where they're just like, you know, I'm letting myself go.  Well, people shouldn't wear suits anyway.  It's that tight neck thing and just like that, the skin is just hanging over the tight shirt, buttoned up shirt on the neck.  True.  True that.  Suits are for the young.  Jerks.  Jerks.  Cut your eyebrows and don't wear a suit, you jerk. 
[00:44:30]  Wojo is Jerry's dad on Jay Moore's show.  What?  I did not know that.  What?  Wojo Hoets was still working?  How Linden is Betty White's love interest in Hot in Cleveland?  No way.  I did not know that.  So he's still working?  Hold on a minute.  Boy, we know nothing.  Jeff in Colorado.  Yeah, I haven't seen any episodes.  I just saw a commercial with Hal doing some comeback with Betty White. 
[00:45:00]  Wow, yeah.  Well, Betty White's got a new sitcom that, is it good?  I haven't watched it.  I hate the sitcom.  No, that Betty White's on fire now.  Oh, she's the wacky fucking sexist.  Sexual old broad.  Right.  But hey, if you guys wanted to see some bushy eyebrows, all you needed to watch was last weekend's British Open.  All the elderly Englishmen.  Yeah, they don't trim their shit.  They don't cut their fucking eyebrows.  This guy is absolutely right. 
[00:45:30]  Maybe that's why it's in the back of my head again.  Bushy.  I was watching the British Open.  This guy's right.  The older gentleman at the British Open.  Well, that's just, that's a bigger problem.  That's a caveman.  The caterpillar eyebrows, that's a whole different thing.  I'm talking about the ones that just, just are, yeah, he's got them.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Marty's got them.  Scorsese.  Call him Marty.  Marty Scorsese.  Marty.  He has giant eyebrows.  The fucking Harry Potter has pretty bushy eyebrows.  Well, the English in general have some, some bushy eyebrows, right? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  I'm, I'm talking about the flyaways.  That come from the scurvy?  Did that come, don't go hand in hand with the scurvy?  Oh, God.  They really do like their wacky, bushy eyebrows in England.  Uh-huh.  Rebecca De Mornay, Scott of New Orleans, is coming up with.  Ah, Rebecca De Mornay.  People that used to be huge.  Rebecca De Mornay.  She was an A-lister.  A-lister.  Now, what's your favorite Rebecca De Mornay scene of all time? 
[00:46:30]  Now, you were going to go with the obvious one.  I was going to go with the obvious.  Just go with the obvious, because then I'll tell you mine.  All right.  Tom Cruise.  Mm-hmm.  On the train.  Mm-hmm.  In risky business.  Mm-hmm.  Pretty hot.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, yeah.  E-Rock wants to guess mine.  Let's see if E-Rock knows me.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  What's my favorite Rebecca De Mornay scene of all time?  Would it be the, uh, the breastfeeding scene in Hand the Rocks the Cradle? 
[00:47:00]  That's absolutely correct, and rebel.  Oh, E-Rock.  Fucking E-Rock rules.  Wow.  The sickest, twisted scene, you know, breastfeeding that other chick's fucking baby.  Hand the Rocks the Cradle was such a bizarre movie, but Rebecca De Mornay was playing like  the nanny, whatever, and, uh, who was the other broad in that?  She was pretty hot, too, for the time.  I forgot her name.  You're looking it up, E-Rock. 
[00:47:30]  That's not helping me.  Oh, E-Rock.  But she's-  First of all, I gotta know, is that Madonna's daughter?  Yeah.  It was a while ago.  I think since she's learned to trim and shave.  Dude.  Well, she's got-  That's a problem, though.  She's got a fucking mustache.  Well, Madonna's a hairy mess.  I know.  She's got a whole team of people ripping out hair 24 hours a day.  But she-  She's growing in everywhere on that woman.  In her daughter picture, she's got a fucking little mustache, and her brow-  It's almost unibrow-ish. 
[00:48:00]  I can't fucking describe it.  It's almost a unibrow.  Well, her husband-  Her husband.  Her father is what?  Colombian or something?  Colombian.  Some kind of Latino.  Some kind of-  Yeah.  Some kind of, uh-  Lordis.  See if she cleaned up.  Did she clean up?  Did Lordis clean up?  Because she's a fucking hairy disaster.  She's starting to look good.  I bet she got a bush at fucking eight.  She's going to be ridiculous.  Is she?  Yeah, I think so.  She's going to be way hotter than Madonna ever was.  I want recent pictures.  She's starting to come together. 
[00:48:30]  Well, I mean-  That's not a good one.  Nah, she's doing the fucking-  What, the, um-  Designing-  Design and-  What, the big glasses?  She's wearing big glasses.  Nah, that's-  You can tell she's going to look good.  She's going to be ridiculous looking.  But she is really going to have to maintain that fucking hair shit.  Annabelle Esquire was the other, uh, woman in Hand that Rocks the Cradle.  So she had, she had a fucking baby and, uh, she can't figure why the baby doesn't want  to latch onto her boobs anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, uh, she discovers that, uh, Rebecca has been offering up her bosom. 
[00:49:00]  Her bosom.  Her bosom.  What a sick fucking movie, man.  She fucking made the baby bond with, uh, with her.  Instead of the, the mom.  And the, the, the baby's just pushing away and the mother can't figure out.  And she's crying.  That was fucked up.  I don't know why.  That was such a fucked up movie.  Uh, I just got a text from Philly, my brother-in-law, talking about, uh, celebrities that are dicks  and this comes up every time and I, I, I like saying it every fucking time. 
[00:49:30]  Who's a jerk?  Well, and, and let it be known that my brother-in-law is a huge Philly's fan.  Mm-hmm.  He's got, uh, not season tickets, but he's got a nice package so he fucking goes to a bunch  of games every year.  He hates Jason Wirth because we all went to the UFC event in Philly.  We had really nice seats thanks to Dana White and we were meeting everybody.  I mean, everybody.  Even Kevin James came over and took a picture.  Not a big Kevin James fan, but he was really nice to us and all the UFC fighters, everybody. 
[00:50:00]  Love that new movie.  Dana White himself came over.  He's running the fucking event and he made sure he had time to make sure we're okay and  made sure the people I was with got pictures, right?  Jason Wirth walks by and, uh, my brother-in-law asked him for a picture and he actually said,  I don't take fucking pictures.  I don't take fucking pictures?  He didn't, an exact quote, you can see it for yourself.  Not, I don't take pictures or not now.  He actually said, I don't take fucking pictures.  He wasn't just being an asshole?  And you know what?  For the sake of it? 
[00:50:30]  We, well, that's, we weren't sure.  So we actually, we actually asked him three different times with three different people and  he had no, he had no idea that we're all together and he said, he said no every fucking time.  He was the only person that wouldn't take pictures with, not only with us, but everyone  else in the area.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Cause we had, we had like prime seats where everyone was walking by.  So he is a jerk.  He's, he's a big time jerk.  There was an incident in Philly recently with him.  He pushed a fan out of the way or something during a baseball game. 
[00:51:00]  Maybe someone could refresh my memory on the latest Jason Wirth, a jerky thing he did.  What's his problem?  Emilio Estevez?  Uh, I, he can still fucking walk around, right?  Drew in Pennsylvania has one.  Jan Michael Hall.  Jan Michael Hall?  Wait a minute.  He was pretty fucking big.  Wait.  He...  Isn't it Jan Michael Vincent?  Or...  John Michael Hall. 
[00:51:30]  Jan Michael Hall.  Anthony Michael Hall?  What is this guy doing?  Yeah, who the fuck are you talking about?  But it makes sense.  He's getting two names.  Drew, what do you got?  I got my favorite Rebecca DeMornay story for you.  Well, first talk about who the fuck you were talking about who used to be famous.  Yeah, I think I fucked that up.  So I'm going to skip right over that.  No, no, you're not.  You can't, you can't just skip over it.  God, I wish we had that in our playbook. 
[00:52:00]  Where me and Ed could just go, you know what, I just fucked up the last ten minutes of radio.  I'm going to just skip over that.  I'm just going to skip over that.  No, no, you're not.  Who did you mean?  Yeah, the dude from Airwolf.  How's that?  That's Jan Michael Vincent.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  He kind of had a fall from grace as far as his career went.  He was huge, and then he got on the drugs.  He couldn't get off the drugs and the boozing.  Yeah.  And that was that.  Okay.  You don't just fucking glaze over something like that? 
[00:52:30]  Gloss over it?  Well, my favorite Rebecca DeMornay is when she was working at the bookstore, and George  Costanza tried to return the book that had been red flagged.  Oh.  Took it in the bathroom.  That was Rebecca DeMornay?  No.  She was a large black woman, and he asked her for her name, and it was Rebecca DeMornay.  Oh, okay.  But you said my favorite. 
[00:53:00]  Isn't Danny the big flamethrower guy there?  Well, Travis is.  Travis is.  I am, too, but not as good as Travis, believe me.  But, yeah, I'm not quite recalling it.  Sorry.  Sorry.  All right.  I'm out.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  I was actually looking for some Seinfeld episodes last night.  You know, Netflix, I love Netflix, but it's a crapshoot when you go for the instant view,  and you're really hoping, you go like, let me look.  All right, here it is. 
[00:53:30]  Let me scroll down and see if it's.  No, it isn't.  Oh.  It just bugs me.  You're looking for something in particular, and they don't have it?  Yeah, like instant.  I thought maybe I would just.  Do you know how fucking spoiled you are?  Dude, I know.  I am really spoiled rotten.  You have instant movies that are delivered to your screen within a second of you hitting play.  And you're not happy.  It goes back to that Louis C.K. bit where everything's awesome and no one's happy.  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  Like, the one thing that you wanted to watch wasn't on instant, so Netflix sucks. 
[00:54:00]  Meanwhile, they have probably tens of thousands of titles that you could stream instantly to not only your television,  but your mobile device.  But they're not the ones that I always want.  Watch something else.  But I wanted to watch, like, I thought, because they got every season of Seinfeld on, and they don't have it for instant.  Now, they got lost, and that's available instant.  So why the fuck is it like Seinfeld instant? 
[00:54:30]  I just thought I'd pop it on, and, ah, ah.  Seinfeld ruined the sitcom for everybody else.  Yeah, it really did.  Just a little statement there.  I'm not a fan of the...  How about Bridget Fonda?  Holy shit, she was huge for, like, a few years.  Yeah.  What does she look like now?  She's pretty hot, too, no?  She's very good.  She was in Single White Female, wasn't she?  Was that the one?  Yeah, yeah.  Was that the one, I love my hair like this? 
[00:55:00]  I love my...  Yeah.  She got her hair cut like the other chick.  Who was the other?  The other one was from Fast Times.  The girl from Fast Times.  Yeah, the kooky one from Fast Times.  Yeah, Stacey.  The whore.  Is that her now?  I don't know if it's now.  God damn.  She can't look that good still.  There's no way.  Dude.  Dude!  Yeah, that's not too shabby.  Okay, we got the Jason Wirth story, the latest jerk move by this guy. 
[00:55:30]  Jerk.  Go ahead, Tony, and where are you from?  Sickleville, Sickleville, New Jersey, about 40 minutes out of Atlantic City.  All right, cool.  What do you got?  What do you got, Tony?  What happened was Wirth was going for a foul ball, and the fan reached out.  Well, I actually didn't reach out.  It was in foul ball territory, and Wirth went to get the ball,  and the fan took the ball away, and he said,  and you could read his list on TV and said,  what the fuck are you doing?  And that was the whole incident.  And he's getting traded anyway, man.  He's probably going to get traded sometime this week. 
[00:56:00]  The fucking guy's batting like 220.  Oh, he's having a shitty year?  Oh, he's down.  I didn't even know that.  Huh?  He's making 16 mil.  He's making 16 mil a year.  He's traded.  They're going to wind up trading in Tampa Bay, so fuck him.  He's a bum anyway, dude.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I just want to let you know that that's what the whole thing was.  And the fan came.  He was on TV and everything.  He had to apologize and everything.  So that's about it.  That's all I got.  You know what?  You shouldn't have to apologize.  You know, it is what it is.  He looked like a complete jerk in front of everyone, but I don't think he has to apologize 
[00:56:30]  for that, right?  As long as he didn't touch the kid.  You know, it's one of the things with the fan.  It was just like a five-minute TV moment.  You know, the father was like, I was really upset.  Shut the fuck up.  Right.  You and your little 10-year-old kid.  You know what I mean?  But he had to right away to the ball.  I mean, you know, the ball was, it wasn't like he had to reach out for it.  I mean, it was in the stands.  But, like I said, the guy, you can just tell him, just by when he gets up to the bat,  he's just a jerk-off, you know, with his big fucking grizzly Adam's beard and shit. 
[00:57:00]  He's just a joke.  But, like I said, it's already talk about him going, he's getting traded because of  his contract.  Wait, he's getting traded?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's on the block.  Because Philly, they need pitching and all that.  And they can get rid of that money.  They'll bring this kid up from the play.  Yeah.  It's just, it's sickening.  Especially as a fan, you watch this guy.  It's just, I mean, it's just, the strikeouts, everything, man.  It's just, the guy's a fucking total mess. 
[00:57:30]  So, yeah.  And, like I said, he's batting like 230, 236 or something like that.  Definitely not worth it.  Phoebe Cates.  What's that?  Thank you, Tony.  Tony's just babbling along.  He's thinking about Phoebe Cates.  I love Phoebe Cates.  Who didn't?  And now that's a girl that was huge back in the 80s.  Red Bikini.  The famous scene in Fast Time.  Red Bikini.  And now she is kind of fat.  Well, I saw her at a Knicks game, but that's probably about 10 years ago now. 
[00:58:00]  And she was still looking good then.  Yeah.  So.  Drop dead Fred.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  What does she look like now?  Gremlins.  Yeah, let's see what she looks like now.  But Phoebe Cates, 2009.  Oh, no.  We'll give her a year.  Oh.  Is that really her?  Oh, well.  You know what?  Oh. 
[00:58:30]  She kind of looks like a chubby Kate Hudson with dark hair, right?  She doesn't wear fat well.  She just doesn't.  And she's probably not even that fat, but compared to how we remember her.  See, she doesn't look that.  No, no.  She's not.  What?  I don't know what to say.  I don't know how to describe this either.  She's got like this rumor Willis gullet thing happening.  Yeah.  What's going on with the bottom of her fucking like jaw?  But she's still. 
[00:59:00]  She's still all right, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Compared to what.  Well.  Jesus.  Fucking A.  You know what?  That time is a motherfucking bitch.  Time stinks on ice.  Thanks for punching that picture up, Danny.  Jesus.  Holy fuckeroni.  I don't even know what that's from.  What book is that from?  I don't know, but I have to watch it immediately and jerk off.  That's from my beat off fantasy.  That's not from Fast Times.  No.  That might be a couple years before Fast Times.  Holy moly.  Wow.  All right.  That time just sucks.  She really was just the fucking it girl back then.  She was one of those girls that just. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Like, look at.  Well, you can't.  It's radio.  The other one's from Fast Times.  That's where she's sitting on the diving board.  The other one's called Paradise.  Paradise.  She's just naked on the beach in the ocean for most of the movie.  Oh, what am I doing?  Why aren't I on Mr. Skin?  Oh, Mr. Skin, Danny.  I love how we get all agitated.  It's fucking.  You saw Paradise?  I'm looking at Mr. Skin right now.  And you see her naked?  Can't share. 
[01:00:00]  Not from in there, huh?  She's showering next to a cliff.  Oh, cliff.  What?  She is?  Is she in Paradise naked?  Holy mackerel.  Oh, dude.  You got bush shots?  Bush shots?  No, really?  Let me see.  But it says there's a body double also.  Oh, fuck.  I hate those body doubles.  We can pretend.  I don't like the body double because it's that element of doubt.  It's like the fucking, the firing squad where they give the one guy the empty magazine.  You know?  I don't like that element of doubt. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, dude.  Punch her up.  Punch her up.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Wow, wow, wow.  That's fantastic.  And that's not a body double.  That isn't a body double.  That's her.  I could so just jack off to that, like, right now.  I think I will.  Hold on.  Those pictures are a lot easier to jack off to.  Yeah.  That's like, you'd fucking, you'd die for those pictures.  She's bending over, picking up a shell, I think.  That's her?  Is that her?  Is that body double?  I don't know.  It's, mm.  I can't tell.  See?  I can't tell. 
[01:01:00]  I'm getting annoyed.  Is that 1982?  Holy mackerel.  She, oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Look, this is just fantastic.  Look, but that overgrown muff's a little rough.  But it was 82.  Go with the time.  When the girl bends over just slightly and you see darkness coming from behind.  I like that muff.  That's wonderful.  She's swimming underwater.  It looks like a sea urchin in her lap.  It's a sea in the knee.  But she trimmed it down a little bit on the sides for the movie. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, yeah, she did.  I had no idea that she did all this nudity.  How did I not see this movie?  How did I not see this?  Is it available on Instant?  Check it out.  On Netflix?  Because if it's not, I say Netflix sucks a dick.  What's it?  The people at Netflix are jerks.  What is it?  A Blue Lagoon type movie?  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah.  That's Paradise 1991.  Paradigm.  Paradigm.  Para.  Para nothing.  You spelled it wrong? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Fucking A.  Oh, oh.  There it is.  Is that it?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Go on.  Right there, no?  Is that her?  Second one down?  No, it's 2008.  Shit.  Oh, fuck.  What about that?  There's a lot of movies named Paradise.  Can we talk about, what was that movie we were obsessed with for a while?  It's not even on there.  Swimming Pool?  Oh, Swimming Pool.  Oh, good God.  Fuck.  Look at us.  We can't keep a fucking thought in our head.  She's written some other good movies, too.  What?  Yeah.  That same girl from Swimming Pool?  Yeah.  Really?  There's a couple other good movies.  Naked?  Oh, yeah.  She's always naked.  Wait, turn me on to another movie she did. 
[01:02:30]  Hang on, let me get the title.  And tell us the Mr. Skin fucking...  Could you go to Mr. Skin Swimming Pool, please?  Yes.  Immediately.  Get her name.  Immediately.  Just looking at beautiful naked starlets.  We were obsessed with this movie for a while.  Oh, yeah.  This was all we talked about.  And then the old broad had to get naked in the movie?  And ruin it.  Charlotte Rampling or Ludovine?  Ludovine.  Ludovine.  She even has a hot name.  Ludovine.  Ludovine.  Give me a nice picture of Ludovine from Swimming Pool.  Her ample bosom. 
[01:03:00]  Her ample bosom.  Oh, my God.  Isn't she fantastic?  Yeah, that topless broad ain't bad either.  Not the old bitch.  The other movie she's good in is called Water Drops on Burning Rocks.  She's just naked in a bedroom.  Really?  How do you know this?  Or did you just look it up?  But have you seen the movie?  Just on Mr. Skin.  All right, Water Drops. 
[01:03:30]  All right, let's see some pictures from there.  All right, Danny's trolling.  Ten pics, eight video clips.  Wowza.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my fucking Jesus.  Fucking Teardrops.  All right, look.  I need that picture printed out.  And she's going with the old school.  I'll go to the bathroom.  She's going old school bush in this one, huh?  She's got, you know something?  Give me another one.  How many people have marked my words from a few years ago? 
[01:04:00]  Two years ago?  That ruins it for me.  We found a flaw.  What?  Oh.  Her ass is a little long.  That could be.  It's one picture.  It's long.  It's one bad picture.  It's not the lighting.  Shut up.  It's not fat.  It's not wide.  It's just long.  It's the lighting.  No, because you didn't see the line of the bottom of her.  Go back to that picture.  I will sell you this shot.  How are you going to sell it?  Look.  Look at where the actual curve where ass meets thigh.  I see.  It looks like it's straight down because there's no shadow in there because the lighting's fucked. 
[01:04:30]  It's a little long.  No.  That's worse than a long ass.  No, it is.  Long.  I don't know.  Maybe because in this, I guess she's like reaching.  I could kind of see how maybe she's flexing her ass.  Yes.  It's just a bad shot.  It's not looking good.  I think we found a flaw.  That sucks.  By the way, I hope people mark my words.  I said the bush is making a comeback.  Not the full-fledged bush.  Jesus.  But holy...  No, dude.  How bad is that guy?  Mother of God.  It's not the guy.  Talking about the girl. 
[01:05:00]  She's the same bit over and over again.  I know.  That just goes on.  Yes.  I think God spent a little extra time on the boobs and not as much time on the long ass.  No.  I swear to you, her ass is good.  Yeah.  Her ass is good.  Good and is it?  Ludivine.  Ludivine.  Ludivine.  Ludivine.  I don't want to see it now.  Why?  All right.  We're going for more ass pictures.  All right.  What about that first one? 
[01:05:30]  Is that her?  I don't know.  I will see.  Let's see.  Pop it up.  Pop it up.  It's better.  Look, look.  All right.  That shit's got to be lifted up a little.  Are you kidding me?  She needs an ass lift.  Are you shitting me?  I said just a little bit.  No.  That's a wonderful, wonderful.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I see that every day.  It's a little child breastfeeding.  It's called latching.  Latching?  Yeah, the kid's latching on. 
[01:06:00]  What is that?  That's the hiney shot.  Oh, oh, okay.  I'll take this one.  Oh, see?  That's much better.  Now, come on.  All right.  We're back in.  Don't you dare fucking say anything about Ludivine.  Maybe they know she's got a long ass and that's a body double because that ass looked  way better.  Why so long in the ass?  No, she looks great.  Ludivine.  All right.  Should we break?  Oh.  Well, I was just going to go to, you know, there's a radio shot on us. 
[01:06:30]  I know.  We're just looking at nudes.  Check out Swimming Pool if you want like a movie that's, I don't even know if the movie's  good.  I couldn't care if the movie was good or not.  I have no idea if the movie was good.  I remember I saw it all the way to the credits.  Yeah.  She just, you had to wait for the next nude scene with her in it.  Yeah.  There was a lot of really good ones.  When she's having sex on the, like in the, on the side of the pool.  Well, she's just young and having sex and the old broad is trying to like, like just 
[01:07:00]  get some, live vicariously through her.  Well, she's a, I think she's a writer.  So she goes to this house, I think.  I think.  To get away to like write, write her next project or book.  And this young thing is like just young and fucking banging in the other room.  Right.  And she's annoyed because she's wide awake because the, the noise is coming through the  wall.  Yeah.  But that now turns her on and I don't know.  She hears the fucking of the young slut. 
[01:07:30]  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Mr. Skin gives it a great nudity with an exclamation point.  Oh yeah.  It's one of the great nude scenes of all time.  The passion of the Popeye just came in.  Fuck.  Wow.  You know what?  Let's play this after the break.  All right.  Dirk just handed in, Derek just handed in the passion of, oh D-Boy, the passion of Popeye.  Great bit Ant did last week, but Dirk did something with that.  D-Boy, sorry. 
[01:08:00]  And finally, and D-Boy takes his time.  Yes, he does.  The latest Mel Gibson tape came in yesterday.  We did it already.  We could do it again today if you like.  It was wonderful.  Actually, maybe we will do it again today.  It was great.  Another fucking banner appearance.  But D-Boy took the latest Mel Gibson tape, finally found the right audio to do what everyone's  been asking for, the Mel Gibson versus Christian Bale remix.  Thank God. 
[01:08:30]  Now there's a lot of Mel Gibson, Christian Bale remixes on the internet, all over YouTube,  but I think E-Rock's saying this is the best one yet.  Yeah, the other ones are really choppy and not well produced, and the way that D-Boy  did this one is amazing.  D-Boy is amazing.  All right, we're going to check that out.  Jennifer Connelly.  What happened?  Jennifer Connelly.  Put her in.  Put her in, Mr. Skin.  Oh, my God.  Jesus H. Christ.  That scene of her on the beach.  Dude, yeah, there's just a beach scene.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I... 
[01:09:00]  Wow, she gets a lot of stars.  Hall of Fame nudity.  Hall of Fame nudity.  On Mr. Skin, four stars.  Hall of Fame nudity.  Hall of Fame nudity.  I want to see what Hall of Fame nudity looks like.  Where's that picture, that movie of her on the beach?  Oh, shit.  That was, uh, that was her.  Going ass to ass in Requiem, huh?  Oh, crap.  Yeah.  But what, find the one on the beach. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, what scene gave her the Hall of Fame of nudity?  She just looked great.  And who else is in the...  Oh, oh.  It's the hot spot.  I think it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus, thanks, Christ!  Holy fuckaroni.  Why would the other girl agree to be topless next to her?  I know.  There's too much space.  There's too much space.  Ample boosal.  Between those boobs on the other one.  All natural.  Like, you could see, like, the...  Where, like, there's actually a little pec muscle, and then the breast starts. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, that's the worst.  Hey, who else is in the Hall of Fame on Mr. Skin?  Yeah, well, it's the Hall of Famers.  Is it easy to get to the Hall of Famers?  Yeah, can you click on it?  Can we guess the Hall of Fame?  Hall of Fame nudity?  Huh.  Wow.  Like, Phoebe Cates?  Phoebe Cates?  Didn't make Hall of Fame?  She had to have.  Yeah, no, I think she was Hall of Fame nudity.  There's got to be a section that's just a Hall of Fame of nudity.  Yeah, Phoebe Cates was four stars.  Four stars.  How could you...  Can you click on four stars?  You should be able to do that.

[01:16:00]  As though from God's design And as I cried, I told myself  Someday you'd be mine  Ray Dawn Chong Baby, won't you hear my song I have loved you for so long 
[01:16:30]  And I know that I can make you love me too  I write you letters every day I send flowers to your home  But it's difficult to prove my love When you won't answer the phone 
[01:17:00]  And looking through binoculars Makes it really hard  To see you from the camp That I've set up in your front yard  Ray Dawn Chong  Why won't you hear my song?  What am I doing wrong? 
[01:17:30]  Cause I can't seem to make you love me too  I'm here inside my prison cell Just lying 
[01:18:00]  In my bed  I wonder if you loved me When I shot you in my head  Ray Dawn Chong You only had to hear my song  I even bought your dad a bomb 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, Tommy Chong, Jason Chong And all you had to do was love me  I gave you every chance to love me You stupid bitch, you should have loved me too  Ray Dawn  We want to hear what's inside your little brain 
[01:19:00]  Call 866-866-WOW-1-WOW That's 866-969-1969  I had way too much lean beef chili yesterday  Oh no  I might have to run out of this studio in a few minutes  And what else did you have with it?  Cause you know, it's always funny when you say what you had with it  Um  Lean beef chili  And then I had an arugula salad with strawberries and walnuts 
[01:19:30]  With a little balsamic glazed on top  That'll get it festering  And then I had a fudge bar type of thing  It's gonna be a disaster  Sometimes I'm in an awkward situation  Cause I really enjoy my chili  And a lean beef chili  God damn  Went back for  For uh  For seconds  Really?  I was eating it all day  It defeats the purpose  And then I'm watching TV last night  Me and my girl 
[01:20:00]  And the little one  And I'm farting  A little fella  I'm farting up a storm  Storm  You were one of these guys that never  Would fart in front of your woman, right?  No  I really  What if you can't help it?  Would uh  No  I'd rather just  You would hold it in and be uncomfortable  And maybe get really bad stomach pains?  I'd go somewhere else  In the house or something  I was letting them out because they were constant  It wasn't like  Maybe I feel one coming so I'll go into another room type of thing 
[01:20:30]  Just like waves  Just waves  You weren't letting them just sink into the couch cushion?  She was looking at me like  This fucking stinks  And I'm like  Oh god  And I'm like  I don't know what to do  Cause I'm not in  I'll never get to that stage in my relationship  Where you just let it all go  Like we were just talking about  Yeah  The eyebrow hair  I'll always try to do the right thing  Try to stay in shape  Not do all that gross stuff in front of my girl  Yeah 
[01:21:00]  But in this case  I couldn't help it  So it was either like  Just go to the other side of the apartment  And watch TV by myself  Or  Or let the waves continue  Or just fucking stink out the place  She looked at me like  Oh my god  I'm like  Now I feel like an idiot  Can't blame it on the baby?  Blame it on the baby  Not yet  Wasn't me  Not yet but soon  Soon you'll be able to  Yeah because his diapers are getting ready to start smelling  Getting ready  Getting ready  Ready to be ripe  Just a little something  You're like 
[01:21:30]  What is that?  Oh no  I'm starting to get the  What is that?  Cause the first two months  It's easy  Cause it doesn't smell  Are you two gonna be  Parents that  That hold the kid up  And just sniff its ass  In the middle of  The store  And shit like  Oh god no  I see moms just pick the baby up  Shove their nose  In the baby's ass  And just  Oh yeah he needs a changing  No  What the fuck happened?  When I was babysitting the kid yesterday  She hates when I say this  When I was babysitting  And she comes back from the gym or something 
[01:22:00]  You didn't change his diaper  I'm like yeah but he was sleeping  He didn't know any better  Yeah  I don't sleep in his dirty diaper for a while  It'll build character  Well I know when  I know it's dirty when it puffs out in front  See you don't know any of this shit  Nah I have no idea  God bless you I guess  But when you have a baby  And you see it puff out in front  You know that he took a little wee wee action  And you gotta change that I guess  Oh yeah  Although it all absorbs so much into the diaper  Do you really have to change it anytime soon? 
[01:22:30]  My diapers have  I thought that's why they were absorbing  So you just could leave it on the kid  Thank you  My diapers have like a mesh thing  So that  Your diapers?  Well my diapers yeah  A few more years I'm sure  The diapers for the kid have a mesh thing  So then the shit I guess falls through the mesh  And into another section of the diaper  Beautiful  Wow  They thought of everything  Fucking technology  Fucking high tech diapers  Where are the diapers?  All these kids  I've gone through in two months 
[01:23:00]  What's that 60 days?  Easily 10 diapers a day probably  Are you kidding me?  Close to 10 a day maybe  Is that really how many fucking people use?  10 a day?  Well maybe  Maybe 10's a little high  I don't know if 10's high though  6, 7, 8 easy a day  Wow  So I'm a good 500 diapers into this already  Where are those fucking diapers going? 
[01:23:30]  People just throw them away  And I'm one person  Don't they just throw them away?  I'm one fucking person  Do you just throw them in the garbage?  Yeah  So they just go to landfills  Yeah  Where are all the diapers?  All the diapers  With the fucking old televisions  Oh so  So the lean beef chili  Yeah  Kept me up all night  With the wave of just farting over and over and over again  See if you do that too much  It's gonna take something away from the relationship  I understand that  But I'm saying  If I have to go  If I have one  Just one 
[01:24:00]  Fart  I'll do the right thing  And get out of the room  But what are you doing?  It's just  It's part of your night  You just gotta clinch up  Oh man  That's uncomfortable  You gotta clinch up and fucking take the pain  Take the pain  Take the pain  Take the pain  Yeah  Yes  And then every so often  You could get up and  Release a good one  And then you know  Come back not too soon  Those things will follow you  I had one that was so bad last night  It woke me up  It's like 
[01:24:30]  You woke yourself up out of a sound sleeve  It's the weirdest thing  Cause all of a sudden  My kid's sleeping through the night  Which is a good thing  But I'm  I woke up  And you ever wake up  And look around the room  Like why am I awake?  What happened that I'm awake?  And sometimes  Sometimes you realize  It's like a huge rainstorm outside  And like oh  Lightning woke me up  Yeah  Okay  Yeah I usually get woken up  By something loud on the TV  Alright something  So you know the deal  Last night I'm like  Why am I awake?  And I'm looking around  She's sleeping

All I take is Tums  And I went for physical  Nothing wrong with me except for calcium  And that's because my mother wouldn't let me drink milk when I was a kid  What, you're deficient?  You're calcium deficient?  I have low calcium  That's it  How'd that happen?  I don't know  Because my mother didn't let me drink milk when I was a kid  It was for tea  It was for tea?  She had loved tea  What about cereal when you were a kid?  No, no cereal  Did you have cereal as a kid?  No, she would make a half a loaf of toast every morning 
[01:46:30]  What?  You didn't have cereal as a kid?  Toast with like a pound of butter on it  Where it just got real thin and wet  Fantastic, correct  Oh yeah  Jesus  We were just white trash dude  She was sleeping in the living room  She bought a two bedroom apartment  She moved out of my stepfather  Who used to beat the shit out of us  Yeah  And moved in  She wouldn't take any money from the guy  She's just a twat  She wouldn't take...  The guy had money  Wouldn't take any money  And moved us into a two bedroom  She lived in the living room  Like some fucking Harlequin  Just like...  Like she was prostituting herself on weekends

[01:47:30]  I had...  Ugh...  Just...  I didn't have a polo  I had like some fucking lightning bolt  And I used to wear...  I remember I used to...  We were home alone so much  I lit myself on fire in my feety pajamas  Trying to make tea  How old were you?  Your feety pajamas caught on fire  How old were you?  Yeah I was like fucking...  Actually I was 18  I was 18  Yeah 18 years old  With the flap open  You had...  Feety pajamas that you lit on fire?  Dude yeah because you know...  They're fucking...

The whole thing goes up too  Like the whole outer layer of fuzz on feety pajamas  Is waiting to be lit on fire  You know what I mean?  It's like when you light your arm hair on  It just...

Fifty-seven percent  Only my asshole is gay  My asshole just says feed me a seymour  How did you get out of the feety pajamas as you were on fire?  Yeah how did that end?  How did that end?  You can't just stop, drop and roll  It literally... 
[01:49:00]  Feety Pajama has that little fuzz  You know the fuzz that comes off of it  After wearing them for a while?  Yeah a little fuzz  Yeah it's like a fucking dog with cancer  Jesus  Right yeah  Danny found a feety pajama picture of a guy  It's a fucking guy  It's not a kid  Looks great  You can't wear those after a certain age  You just look gay  No because it's 170 degrees  I think after 25 you really should move on to...  After 25?  What?  25?  Yeah  A little hatch in the back for easy cock access 
[01:49:30]  Oh  You ever just snip your dick in that zipper?  Oh yeah  What?  That zipper is fucking...  You never got your zipper caught in your penis?  I've done it in adulthood  Everyone does it, you gotta be careful  But never in feety pajamas  Jeans without fucking underpants or something  Yeah but it's like fucking him  His cock was like a leg when he was five  That's true  So how do you...  You can't fucking snip it  I've gotten to the point now where I don't deal with the zipper as a danger factor 
[01:50:00]  I pull...  I like unbutton my pants, zip down, and then just pull the underwear down over the zipper to make a protective like a protective coping over the zipper  A bumper?  A bumper?  Yeah, a bumper  It's a fucking bumper over the zipper  Yeah  And then you take your leg, you shake, and then you pull your undies back up and you're safe  Now you're the zipper ain't getting anything  Do you...  Are you wearing tighty undies or boxer shorts?  I wear briefs 
[01:50:30]  Briefs?  Just regular briefs, not boxer briefs?  I wear your regular...  Boxer briefs  Briefs  No, I don't like anything that's too restrictive  That are bikini briefs  For boxer briefs  And then I don't like boxers because they don't offer any support  And I don't care how long you sit and shake  When you walk away, you're gonna feel a trickle go down your fucking leg  Yeah  You want a little absorbency  Yes  And you want support  Yes  And you don't want shit shifting and turning around in your pants 
[01:51:00]  Like loose boxers  You pull your pants up  The boxer leg is now up in your crotch area  Fuck that  You have to pull...  When you take a shit in boxers, you have to pull the boxers and the pants up at the same time  Or you're fucked  It's just gonna mush into your asshole  All...  Your underwear would just be in your asshole  I actually use the pea sleeve now  I'm old school in it  You go through the...  I use the pea sleeve  I don't think I've ever stuck my dick through a hole in underwear  You can't  You must have a small fucking penis 
[01:51:30]  This was another man's  For docking purposes only  Actually...  Hey, Trevor in Arizona though, no calcium you said, right?  No calcium?

See that? She had an awful ass  Is that her?  Yeah  You think that's an awful ass?  Well, the tan line doesn't help because it was those big underwear type bikinis they used to wear back then

Fucking up your legs  Oh yeah  My ankles  And I'm like fucking what do I do?  Like spraying off on myself  And I'm inside my house  Yeah, I had my apartment  Bombed and everything  And it took forever to go away  A year later  I was still getting bit by a flea that survived 
[01:55:30]  It was a nightmare  And now I got scars up and down both arms  From flea bites  And my ankles are just shot  Because they jump up from the floor  Bite you on the ankle  They spring  And the scars  And the bite  I don't know  It takes forever to heal  I don't know  I'm getting the heebie-jeebies now  Maybe Dr. Steve could explain why  Flea bites seem to take forever to go away  And stop itching  Well what they do is  As a parasite  They need  I haven't blinked in three hours  You've noticed that too?

[01:58:00]  I would appreciate that  And...  Oh, are you going to do the Louis C.K. going on break?  Yeah...  All right, good  Listen to this  I figured every kid smells good  I thought it smelled like a...  I don't know  As a guy, your relationship to the vagina  It just changes completely  Really?  Because there's always this mysterious, beautiful little pouty thing  That I only catch in glimpses in the dark  Maybe three times in 40 years  And now I gotta clean shit out of two of them daily 
[01:58:30]  I have to literally scrape shit out of my daughter's little red vagina  A few times a day  A few times a day  Oh my god  Gotta get in there with the wipey, make a corner out of it, and get the shit out of it  Holy fuck  Every time she takes a shit, it goes straight up her gun  Oh my god, I had no idea  It's true  The OB and Anthony  The OB and Anthony show on the fire  Sirius XM  We gotta talk about smoking 
[01:59:00]  We got Bob Kelly in studio  And Mark Maron has stopped by to say hi as well  And these guys are talking about quitting smoking  And, man, Mark got it out of Bobby, I guess  Bobby, if you remember, quit smoking about four months ago  You were telling me, right, Bobby?  We were all very proud 
[01:59:30]  Four months ago, I just stopped, yeah, when I was in California  And you were out of your mind for a while  But you pretty much got through it  And now we're learning today that you're back smoking a little bit  It is such  Which, by the way, means you're gonna be completely smoking very soon  Absolutely  It's fucking the worst  Why did you go back into the smoking thing?  I just, I wasn't  I  My rage that was coming out of me  Was fucking  Like a  I mean, just  Atomic rage 
[02:00:00]  That's what I'm afraid of  Atomic  I'm afraid of it  Because I  I haven't smoked a cigarette in ten years  I was on the nicotine gum  The nicotine lozenges  I was importing snooze from Sweden  I don't know what the fuck snooze is  I'll tell you what it is  It's fucking  Snooze  It's unbelievable, dude  It's unbelievable  What is it?  I told you an email on a show I was doing  She goes  I quit smoking using Swedish snooze  And they sell it here now  Camel makes it in marble  Snooze?  Here's what it is  Can you look up snooze?  It's a chewing tobacco product  Yeah  It comes in packets  You stick it in your upper lip  So you don't have to spit 
[02:00:30]  So it's a little packet, right?  So I ordered this pack  From Sweden  I get this pack  It's got weird letters  And I ordered the extra strong  So it was called Odin's Extra Sterk  What the fuck?  Extra Sterk  So  And it's licorice  And I get this shit  I put it in my mouth  And let me tell you, Bobby  Within 45-50 seconds  Sweat's beating up on my forehead  I'm starting to feel nauseous  I gotta sit down  It's way too much  No, but most people that happens to  They'd be like  Fuck this  But no, me, I'm like  I can ride this out 
[02:01:00]  I can adjust to this  There it is  That's it  I didn't do that one  What is it called?  Goat  Look at the letters  Goat  Rape  Yeah, but that's a  They've got all different brands in Sweden  All different types  But it's called rape  It's ripped  Nothing better than a word  Tobacco is called rape  Nothing better than a word  With an O  With those two  Umlots  Umlots  I just call it two dots  Aren't those umlots?  But I was on this shit  It has shaved like lake shark fin in it 
[02:01:30]  But that's why I had to quit  Because I thought  Because it was Swedish  It wasn't giving me mouth cancer  And that shit's stupid  That's like saying  Swedish girls can't give me  Something  The herp or something  That shit right there  I can't fuck  I don't wanna  Chewing tobacco to me  Is fuck  Putting anything in my mouth  Unless it's a cock  Yeah, exactly  Unless it's a nice fucking cut cock  With a fat helmet that turns red  It was so good  Calm down Bobby  It was so good  But I understand the rage Joe  That's what's happening to me now  Nicotine is very good at suppressing rage  And sadness 
[02:02:00]  And hunger  You don't understand how much  And my childhood  How much fucking  How much cigarettes  Like I didn't know I got nervous before shows  Until I stopped smoking  And then all of a sudden  I was panicking before shows  I never get nervous before shows  All of a sudden  I'm sitting outside the club  Oh my god  Fucking like  I gotta go on  What the fuck  Who do I have  Oh dude  And the rage that would come out of me  I was on a mountain  I told you  Last time I was here  I was on a fucking mountain  Hiking with my chick  She wasn't using the stick correctly  So I just said  I don't hear the way 
[02:02:30]  I try to teach people  The stick  Yeah we were using  You know walking sticks  We had walking sticks  It was real wet  Just thinking of you  Knowing how to use those properly  Makes me laugh  Well no it's not even that  It's not even using it properly  Hold on you hear how he said that too  Because it was wet  You can't climb up a mountain  That's wet  Without sticks  No  Why?  Of course you can asshole  So why are you using walking sticks  You're not  Are you an asshole?  You're not 75 years old  What are you fucking investigating?  Exactly  You can't  Shut up and let me tell the story  Fucking 
[02:03:00]  Did you have two or one?  17  Shut up  Smoke a fucking cigarette buddy  Jesus who cares  Have a cigarette  Thank you  He fucking just stinks  You're just observing about dumb shit  Take a break  Time out  I've walked up mountains  You don't use sticks  We use  Yeah but you can't  Maybe you grab one  Cause it's kinda cool to have a stick  But then you throw it away  You don't actually use it to help ya  I had a stick growing up here  Is that what this is going to?  Did you hit her with the stick?  No but if I had a fucking stick now  I'd fucking do a bearded shit face  Why are you getting mad at him? 
[02:03:30]  I'm fucking not Trump smoking  Shut up  I'll fucking jump over this console  Wow  Do that  I'll fucking bite all your freckles  Do it  Do it  Do it  Do it  Do it  Do it  Are they ski poles?  Are they ski poles?  When you talk to your chick  Ski poles?  Oh shit  Kenny comes in  What's that?  No I can handle him  No threats of violence against GH  I know that just sucks  I would call him off  It's just me and you Bobby  I can't believe in that 
[02:04:00]  Bobby would start calling him  Halfway over the console  Me and you  Just me and you  I'll call him off  What do you mean?  No problem  Let's just call him off right now for good  Bye bye  Bobby would get all winded halfway over from smoking  Just call him off for good right now  I've said bye bye  Look at him  Call your robot off  I don't need Kenny  Tell him to leave  He's like Klaatu  Tell him to walk  He's like Klaatu  Let's do it  Tell him to go plug him  Let's just do it  Tell him to go plug himself back in  Like a  Like a Roomba  You're like a fucking Roomba 
[02:04:30]  That kicks ass  You can't get a Roomba if you own a cat by the way  Because if it shits on the floor  It comes out  And just spreads it  Like fucking peanut butter all over your floor  Did that happen to you?  A friend of mine had a fucking two cats  He moved in with a chick who had two cats  He's a techie geek so he had his Roomba  That sucker came out during the day  And just spread that all over the kitchen tile  He came home and he had brown kitchen tile  The whole thing  Alright so where were we?  He's about to beat his chick with a stick 
[02:05:00]  Cause he needs two sticks to climb up a  Not two  And it wasn't a mountain by the way  I'm sure it was like  2500 feet  At what fucking incline?  17  Who knows?  What are you fucking mountain climbing Ope?  Incline  Who the fuck has dumb questions?  He  What he does  It's not dumb if it's 25  25 what?  100 feet  2500 feet  You can use your iPhone  I don't know  That's like a half a mile  Whatever it was  It didn't help him at all  So  Like  Sat there and gone  Put the incline meter on 
[02:05:30]  And your iPhone app  And see what your incline was  Hang on what did you say?  I said however  Exactly  Oh damn  Wow  Bobby's controlling the room right now  Watch out  You would not  Watch out everyone  You heard it  You heard it  It hurt your feelings  You turned around and make me look like an asshole  No you tried to make me look like an asshole  You got nothing  And I just called you out  Now you felt like an asshole  Cause I made you feel like an asshole  No but you hurt it  And it hurt your feelings  Shut up  I'm talking to two guys that need a cigarette desperately  No we need a hug  Not a cigarette  I'm so tired of hugging you  Every time I see you I gotta hug you 
[02:06:00]  You gotta look me in the eye  That has nothing to do with fucking emotions  Yes it does  That has to do with sexual attraction  Oh shit  Well just  There's nothing more I like than a fucking older alt comic look  That shit turns me on  Oh shit  Yeah you like that  No you're a fucking good looking guy  I like it  Tell your walking stick story  No fuck you  You know what Opie  Go fuck yourself  You fucking  Let's do it  Let's do it right now  Two steps  Let's do it  Get out of that chair  Unplug your fucking headphones and walk 
[02:06:30]  Let's do it  That's all I need is you to walk  Right now  Was it a rain stick  Yeah it was a rain stick  Fuck you you fucking saboteur  You are a fucking saboteur  Fuck you go get it  But I guess the point is though  That I can't stop my rage either  I started dating this girl  And I you know  And I tested her by not smoking  By not having nicotine  And I made her cry like three or four times  In the first two weeks  Really  That we were dating  Yeah and that's just courting to me  And then  She you know she she weathered the storm  And she's still with me 
[02:07:00]  It was unbelievable  Wow I hear the snooze  Burns your eyeballs  Is that true?  The snooze burns everything  Why?  You can feel it in your nose  Because it just goes up through your nasal passages  It can't be good  Depending on  What do you mean it can't be good?  The burn man  You just wanna hear that  Anytime you feel the burn  It's a good thing  Things are growing  Things are good  Whenever you talk about the burn  Unless it's exercise  It's not good  Okay  Alright  But for me  That shit was so  Like I would wake up and do it  I'd do it all day long  And it made me high  It almost got to the feeling 
[02:07:30]  Where I thought I was relapsing  Cause I'm a sober guy  Wow  And I felt like I was getting that high  Off of this tobacco shit  And I'm like  I can't lie to myself  I gotta kick this stuff  So I kicked it  Narcotic  Some type of  Definitely  Definitely  And I was on those lozenges  And also my gums  I was  My fucking gums  Started to recede  From the nicotine gum  Jesus  From the snooze  And I was like  So I'm gonna look like a skeleton  Holy shit  Is it worth it  But when you're  A fucking addictive mind  Some part of you is going  I could live like that 
[02:08:00]  I mean you can't really see my gums  I could live like that  I mean as long as they know  If it doesn't affect my lips  I'll be alright  You just need lips  See I just need lips to function  I don't care if my teeth are brown  And I have no gums  I have no gums  Why are you smoking again Bobby  I just fucking couldn't do it  No with the stick  Get back to the stick story  No  No  You think it's my first fucking  Yeah well they didn't fucking  I don't like them  They weren't  Move on  No they were good  Why were you gonna beat up your girl  Cause she wasn't using the stick right  Are you fucking 
[02:08:30]  I'm being serious now  I don't care  Now you're being weird  I don't care  Now you're being weird  I don't care  Because it goes back to why you're smoking again  What were you saying  But here's  What you're talking about  Is that when you don't smoke  When you pull that thing out  That wedge between  You know your sad  Frightened  Angry bullshit  Right  And reality  You know nicotine  Is like a buffer  Between that and the world  As soon as that buffer goes  There is no  There is no  Kind of  What do I want  You go right from like  Hey what's going on  Go fuck yourself 
[02:09:00]  Go fuck yourself  You have to understand  Cause you're sober too  Is that there's  You  There's no alcohol  There's no drugs  I can't  Do the internet fucking porn shit  Or Craigslist  When did that stop?  I just don't do it anymore  When did that stop?  And then there's no  There's nothing  The only thing  You don't even angrily masturbate anymore?  I lost the weight  Which fucking sucked  Yeah  So I couldn't even eat shit  So then when I quit smoking  It was like the last fucking thing  Your last vice  That I put  I was like let me try this 
[02:09:30]  I wasn't ready  I wasn't ready  The fucking weight tumbled on  It just fucking  Tumbled on  It does  It does  Just with no nicotine  I'm not even eating that much different  I don't even know why the hell that is  That's going to send me back into  Like I want to smoke now  Like I hadn't smoked in 10 years  I want to smoke  Jesus  And you just shovel food into your fucking face  And you don't even know it  I was at the club last night  There was a plate of fries there  I don't even remember eating them  It's like  They were just gone  They were just gone  I just ate one  And then I realized in the minute  You know when you compulsively do shit 
[02:10:00]  You ever seen Russ Meneve eat?  He eats like that  Where you just  And I'm not saying a bad thing about Russ  I appreciate the way he eats  But like I just had one fry  And the next thing I knew  I just shoveled 50 fucking fries into my face  There's a guy who actually  And it didn't help  Russ Meneve actually  Is thinner than fucking you right now  He's only eating  What do you mean thinner than me?  He's eating like a thousand calories a day  He is  He's  He's  He's conquered  His weight thing  But but but  Because he's been fat  He's been skinny and fat his whole life  And his food has been his fucking drug  But conquering that means just that  You become this insane control freak 
[02:10:30]  Exactly  That's right  He's around weighing food  Yeah like he  He had a tomato with turkey on it the other day  And he  That's it  I've been there  Because I lost 20 pounds  I don't want to be  I'm not being a pussy by saying I went to Weight Watchers  But it was very you know  It's exciting to be around  Just uh  Doesn't have many fat people  But uh  So I  I went to Weight Watchers  Right  Around people like you  And I  And I  Nothing  Nothing  I don't mean stupid  Just tell your story  Just go  Bobby wants to kill someone

[02:12:30]  We don't know  Why?  Does he have a colostomy bag under his t-shirt?  We don't know  We don't know  What is that?  We don't know Bobby for real  It's my cell phone  Right  He's got old school cell phone like they use  What was it?  Canon  It's a StarTac  A StarTac  In Wall Street  Michael  Yes  He's walking down the  Don't do that  With a car in his ear  It's not that  You're dividing  Because I know what you're going to say already  This is  And Ann has pushed your buttons too  You don't know what I'm going to say  He's pushed your buttons too  If you're going to ask me a question 
[02:13:00]  Now he's going to bust my balls about the joke  If you're going to  No I'm not  If you're going to ask me a question  I'm going to answer your question  This is what happens  And when you get people like your uncles  And then I bring a friend over  They usually bond with each other through you  They're like yeah he's a fucking  This fucking asshole  I know he is an asshole  Right  Wait a minute  I fucking like you  And I like you  Fucking  So when he comes in  He's fucking with my story  I'm trying to tell a story  Then he fucking treats me like a caller  Cause I'm fucking  You fucking asshole  You're out of your mind

[02:14:00]  You were skipping down the hall  When you came into the show  I'm very happy  I'm still happy  That sounds happy  See that's that tone  That's what I was explaining  The non-smoking thing  Is that you don't know how your tone is  You said this  Fuck you I am happy  Yeah  Fuck you  And I want to get you back on track  I'm on track  I don't need you to help me  Shut up  I want to know about the smoking thing  Because that is interesting  We're talking about it  You weren't smoking for four months  You said you started getting nervous before shows  Which never happened to you  And then you said I think in Montreal you started smoking  Yeah  So that was a week or two ago 
[02:14:30]  That's the place to do it too  Two weeks  Because you can really rationalize a lot of shit  Because even the cigarettes are better up there  They are good  They are good  The little tiny ones with the small filters  Yeah yeah yeah  And there was a lot of pressure up there with the industry and everything  I was up there  There's no industry there  I was up nasty week  There's nobody up there  Nobody  So there's really no excuse  No there was  Because the up there  Up there  That's one of the places that I enjoyed smoking  It's like Amsterdam, Vegas, Montreal  Those are places where I fucking love smoking  But didn't you love it everywhere?  No  Exactly  I hated smoking in my house 
[02:15:00]  In the bed  You did?  I hated smoking in my house  I fucking hated it  I can't remember what it was like to smoke but I love smoking  The only place I hated smoking was at the beach  The beach is a weird fucking place  First of all the cigarette doesn't burn right  Yeah it doesn't  The fucking  It runs  Yeah it actually runs  The fucking  The tip goes into the fucking cigarette  Yeah yeah yeah  It goes out  You're trying to fucking smoke it  It doesn't taste right on the beach for some reason  Yeah no it doesn't  Pete currently said it was the best place to smoke  Because you're in a fucking  The largest ashtray 
[02:15:30]  Big ashtray  Yeah yeah yeah  You can just slam the fucking cigarette down in the sand  And you're fine  You know what's sad about this  But the best place to smoke was in a bar  Watching a game on a fucking TV in a bar  With a beer in your hand  And just fucking ashtray in front of you  Just drinking and smoking  Yeah yeah  Fan-fucking-tastic  Yeah yeah  I like the cafe  Really?  Yeah I'd love going out  You like the cafe smoke?  I'd like get a beret  Would you hold it between your thumb and forefinger?  Backwards and go  Oh  I actually had a glove and I had a cigarette holder 
[02:16:00]  A cigarette holder and a monocle  I used to like the morning  Like just have made a pot of coffee  And a pack of Marlboro Reds  And just sit there and fucking smoke  For breakfast  It's better than just packing a brand new pack  Before you open it  It's like it's so far away from me  And it's like brand new  You fucking open it up  When was the last time you smoked?  20 great cigarettes  Fucking years ago  I know  Me too  I don't remember the ritual of that  Like I can't  It's far away from me  A whole ritualistic thing  But what I remember about smoking towards the end  Is that like you know  They started to hurt and taste fucked up 
[02:16:30]  And then you'd say like  You'd know that something was wrong  It started to hurt  Yeah and then you'd have the one good one that felt good  And you'd be like  Okay this still works  It still works  This is still a good habit  Where one of them will just taste fucking wrong  They all taste good to me right now though  Oh it's so lucky  You're so lucky  Because I was bumming cigarettes for the last week  I'm bumming them  So like I'll have a pot in 100  So you're not really buying them  You've got to buy them in  You've got to smoke  You're not buying them in  I'm giving people like five bucks for one cigarette though  That's what they cost  How much are they?  How much are they? 
[02:17:00]  That's ridiculous  $14 a pack  That is fucking ridiculous  No way  No way it's $13 or $14 a pack  There it is  It's because  That's a $27, $28 a day habit  I remember putting down a buck and getting change  Heroin is cheaper than cigarettes  Heroin is cheaper than cigarettes  Right now  You could get two bags of dope  For $10  Or $20  So a carton  A carton of cigarettes  He knows exactly how much the fucking heroin is  A carton is like $140  For a carton is like $140 
[02:17:30]  Yeah  Are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah, it's bad  It's bad  I went to the store last night to get a  I bought  I'm at the stage where I'm buying other people's packs of cigarettes  So I can just bum as much as I want off them  I gave the guy a $20  He gave me back fucking $5 and fucking like $10 or some shit like that  Why isn't there more smuggling going on from that cell?  Oh, there is, dude  And they got the Indian stores  No, I have a guy that shows up  I have a black guy that shows up at the cellar  With a fucking trash bag 
[02:18:00]  That guy still goes  He has a huge fucking afro  Yeah  He just shows up  He has everybody's cell phone  He'll call you up  Yo, you need cigarettes?  He comes down with a carton  They've actually turned cigarettes into a drug  That dealers will sell  I can't believe that  Based on the price  $13 bucks  Wow  $13, $14  When I first started smoking when I was 14 years old  That you could go to a certain gas station  The Husky station  In Albuquerque, New Mexico  And get them for $0.55 a pack  $0.55  I remember $0.75 a pack 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  Where you fucking lay down a buck  You get your pack of cigarettes  And a quarter  And the guy knows you're $12  Didn't give a shit  I remember I used to buy  He didn't care  I smoked on a plane when I was 14  Me too  I was arrested  They had to transfer me from upstate New York to Massachusetts  Holy shit  Yeah, because I was a ward of the state in Massachusetts  But I got arrested up there  So they had to fly me to Boston  So they took me, handcuffs, to the plane 
[02:19:00]  Put me on the plane  I was fucking lighting up with a little tiny ashtray  It's unbelievable that that ever happened  When you're on a plane now  Because you've got to figure  You just sit in the back  The back two rows if you were a smoker  Because I remember smoking on the plane  You sit there, you drink  They'd serve you liquor even if you were 14 or 15 years old  It didn't fucking matter  But could you imagine someone lighting a cigarette on a plane now  The entire plane must have fucking smelled  It did  But I never thought of that  Did you think of that?  They had a smoking section though  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But there was nothing  You're in a fucking tube  That's always been a joke  You're in a fucking tube  You would see the like nicotine and tar on the walls 
[02:19:30]  The stain  Yeah, the stain  With like this dripping looking shit  Smoking on the overhead  Departments were like just yellow  Now you're on a plane though  You see the ashtray and it's just sad  It's like an old  Yeah  It's just screwed shut  It makes me feel like I'm on an old fucking plane  Yeah, exactly  I'm scared out of my mind when I see an ashtray on a plane  Yeah, when I see an ashtray on a plane  Cause you know they just paint those planes  They didn't get a new paint job on those pieces of shit  Yeah, that's a paint job motherfucker  Yeah  Someone was back in the 70's fucking smoking on this thing  They used to smoke on the fucking zeppelins though 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, yeah  I know they had a smoking section on the Hindenburg  Yeah  They did it  Look out that way  A negative pressure smoking room in a hydrogen filled balloon  I guarantee you  If you had footage of that smoking room  There was some guy just right before they landed  Flicked the fucking  Or he flicked it in a Jew  He's just all mad at him  Get out of here, flicks  Jesus Christ  They're fucking Nazis  They're fucking Nazis  There's a big swastik on the tail  Weren't they flying over Jersey?  Yeah  The lights are hitting a Jew were high 
[02:20:30]  Wonderful  The lights are hitting a Jew  Here we go  It's the Hindenburg coming in for a landing  There go the release lines  And oh my god  It's the worst catastrophe ever  The worst catastrophe you've ever seen  Is a fucking giant 20 story swastika going up in flames  Oh there he is  Oh there he is  Yes  It burst into flames  Get this Charlie  Get this Charlie  And it's crashing  It's crashing terrible  Oh my  Get out of the way please  Please  It's running bursting into flames  And it's falling on the mooring fast 
[02:21:00]  And all the folks between  This is terrible  This is one of the worst catastrophes in the world  Oh it's just  It's like 20  Oh  Four, five hundred feet into the sky  And it's a terrific crash  Ladies and gentlemen  The smoke in its place now  And the frame is rising to the ground  This sounds like a cross-bresser  Not quite to the mooring mass  Oh the humanity  Oh the humanity  Oh the humanity  Humanity  Humanity  Oh the poor Nazis  Oh damn  It's a  It's a 
[02:21:30]  Oh  This guy just lost it  I can't talk ladies and gentlemen  Honest  It's just like  Their massive smoking wreckage  What a great journalist  Just falls apart  If something happens  I'm sorry  Oh  Lindsay Lohan's going to jail  Oh it's the worst catastrophe  She's gonna spend 12 days  Oh get out of the way  Oh this is horrible  But that's the thing though  They weren't desensitized back then  They didn't see anything  You know I  You're right  They never saw a fucking  Capping thrown into a ceiling fan 
[02:22:00]  Yeah those  You know what I mean  He's right  Yeah  He's a good point  This guy never saw a  Punched up fucking tub girl on the internet  Two girls one tub  Yeah  He never got tricked  Oh no they tricked me with meat spin  Oh get out of the way  Oh look at the count  I'm up to 10,000  Oh the humanity  There's tub girl  A classic  Oh my god  I've never seen that  Oh no  You've never seen tub girls  There's diarrhea  Bobby 
[02:22:30]  Bobby come on  At least he's getting the nicotine out of his system  Look at tub girl  Did you just throw up  I thought tub girl was fucking the lady hitting her head in the tub  Oh look  You've never seen tub girl  I fucking have but I didn't know you fucking named it  Take a look  It's tub girl  That's great  Take one quick  Oh no  Oh god  You're that sensitive  Yeah he's the worst  Has he thrown up before  Oh no tub girl shooting on her face 
[02:23:00]  Oh it's the worst catastrophe I've ever seen  Oh get your face out of the way  Has that happened before  Oh  Every time  It never gets old  I can't look at that  I can't look at that  Well look at this  This is a lot easier  This is a lot easier to look at  Dude this is a lot easier  No  Look at that  It's a pro-lapse yeah  It's a pro-lapse yeah  It was  No  It's ripping  It's fucking awful  It's a ripping pro-lapse  Oh no no  Bobby it's easy  This one's easy  Bobby just did a spit take  Why you 
[02:23:30]  Oh god  Oh this is great  Why do you  Why does this stuff get to you  I love it  Like you said we've all seen everything now  I love the fucking logic behind that  Why does this stuff get to you  You say that like you just showed me bunnies  But this stuff doesn't bother me  It doesn't bother me  I can't see a  I can't  I can't see a beheading video or anything like that  Yeah  But this shit I can easily see with nothing  I can't  I can't watch a beheading video  But it doesn't gross me out  I can't  I can't watch it  I grew up with this  I can't  It's the 
[02:24:00]  It's the asshole  No I grew up with this shit  My dad was a doctor  And he had all these books  Oh really  He had journals and shit  And you know I used to  When I was like five or six years old  I used to look at his old medical books  Oh god  He had a book of just diseases of the balls  And I would look at this and it was just diseased cocks  What's the worst disease of the balls?  Do you remember?  Any of them that look like that  If anything when there's things dripping  Or there's warts or carbuncles  But other kids were looking at Dr. Seuss  Something like that  I don't even know what that is  Yeah I don't know what that is  I can't even figure out what's one in that picture 
[02:24:30]  That's just a mess of tissue  Of drippy tissue  Bobby you always had it  It's funny that  Most kids grew up with like  Finding a porno mag under their dad's bed  He found diseases of the balls  Yeah that's pretty bad  You know what  Oh look at those balls  Look at that  What is that?  That doesn't make you throw up?  Oh god  I think I have that  I remember some of the medical journals  Looking at him as a kid  And if you're jerking off to like a girl that's naked  With the black strip over her eyes 
[02:25:00]  Oh yeah yeah  You just feel really filthy  I remember that  Like a book of diseases  You had to pick like a not very diseased girl  But it was something that she had to be naked to see  Yeah yeah yeah  Some kind of curvature  Some spine thing you could deal with  Oh my god  Like you're jerking off to a chip of scoliosis  One of those diseases  You can handle that  And black fucking band over her eyes  So you don't know who she is  Where were you guys getting those journals?  I remember from like school  I would go to the library  And it was that and photography books 
[02:25:30]  Yeah  I would go to the library  And then I would take a photography book  I'd put it inside another book  Yeah yeah yeah  And I would slowly tear a naked girl picture out of it  And then put it in my pocket  And so I could beat off with it later  Some...  At the library  I had to go to the fucking library  You kids today got it easy  That's right  When we were kids  The search for porn  It was a long thing  Some kid would show up  Or you'd find a piece of porn under an overpass  Like three pages of a magazine  And you'd go back under that overpass  Three weeks in a row 
[02:26:00]  Yes  Looking for the fucking magazine to show up  You could go weeks without ever seeing porno  Yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  You were constantly looking for it  I remember just walking through a park  Yeah and you find it  Thinking you saw a tit  On a piece of paper  Yeah yeah yeah  And you start dusting up like an archaeologist  Yeah yeah yeah  You know what I mean?  Like you just found a dinosaur bone  The sacred scrolls  But there was some kid who showed up  Do you remember the kid who had the older brother  Who showed up with the one  Yes yeah  The first cum shot I ever saw  Some kid was like 
[02:26:30]  We didn't even know what it was  You know we were like  What is that goop?  You know we were like 12 years old  And then you had to figure out how to do it  What is that goop?  And then you wiped it off your cheek  I'm joking  What about this one?  I had a friend John McCullough  His father had a subscription to Playboy  Was that gold or not?  Oh damn  I was friends with the kid  Just because we would go over to his house  And check out fucking Playboys  I just love it  I love when people give the whole name  Any story with the whole name  John McCullough  I haven't thought of John McCullough in a long time  The only reason I was friends with him  Was because his father had a fucking subscription to Playboy 
[02:27:00]  But do you remember though  The first time you saw how people fucked  Like I mean Playboy was like you know Playboy  But when you saw like how it actually worked  You're like holy shit your balls just caught fire  And you're like this is the best thing I've ever seen in my life  I saw it in a comic book  I was in Walden Books in a mall  The History of Underground Comics  And they had a section on sex  It was like an R. Crumb cartoon  Of people fucking like  That's how it goes in?  That's what that looks like?  And then I found that picture book like  I saw The Joy of Sex 
[02:27:30]  That fucked me up  The Joy of Sex  The best  Wasn't it illustrations?  They were all illustrations  Yeah they were all illustrations  It was such a gift to know how things fit together  You guys fit together  I had the encyclopedia  I had to get creative  Encyclopedia works too  I had to get creative with the encyclopedia  You'd really have to look through it  And figure out like  What subject would maybe have a naked chick  Let's look at naked sick girls  And see which one you would jerk off to  Tahiti was a good one  If you had an encyclopedia  You'd go to the T's  And look up Tahiti  Cause they would show nice Tahitian girls 
[02:28:00]  With the tops off  And the little skirts  And that was good for her  Do you remember how the first time you jerked off?  Do you remember how you did it?  Oh completely  I think my friend did it for me  Oh no  That was yesterday  I had no clue  All I knew is  If I was diddling around  Yeah  It felt good and stuff  So you just fucking  You figure out how to just tug on it  And no one even said like  I'd never heard of jerking off  Yeah  I was just like  Wow this is pretty cool  And the more I do it  The better it gets feeling 
[02:28:30]  It's like wow  Okay  The faster I go  The better it is  And then it starts building up  It's like  What the fuck?  Holy shit  What's happening?  What's happening to me?  Oh my dear sweet God  What is this?  What is this?

[02:36:00]  You're disgusting parents  And this woman  You're disgusting your contemporaries  You just are  But you know what  Who gives a shit  I agree  I don't care  Every day with this program  But this one  I think she's got hold of me  I don't know what  Well you met another chick  I think  It's with a new one  You told the story quickly  Yeah she's got  Retell it to Bobby so you know  She's got hold of me somehow  Here's what  It's romantic how it started  I get an email  Through my website  It's basically  Hi I met you the other night  In San Francisco 
[02:36:30]  I think you're hot  I'm 26  I'm not gonna have this body forever  I really wanna have a fuck fest  With somebody  I want it to be you  And I'm like that's very sweet  So I wrote back  I said where do you wanna go  She goes Portland  And I'm going to Portland  For a comedy festival  So we meet up there  And she's hot  Well I think she's cute  And we end up having sex  Fucking for like three days  And I go that's great  I'm glad we did that  She's like me too  She goes back to San Francisco  I go back to LA  A week later she's like  I'm coming to LA  And I'm like okay  Why?  She's like nothing to do with you  I'm just coming 
[02:37:00]  Because I wanna visit a friend there  So she comes to LA  And it's weird  Because I think she's stalking me  I think it's fucked up  And then I fight with her  And then she goes back  To San Francisco  And I think it's over  And then she  A week or so later she goes  I'm moving to LA  And I'm like why are you moving here?  And she's like  It's got nothing to do with you  And then we fight  She texts me like 49 times  Like it's one of these weird sort of like  You wanna see crazy?  Look at my phone  The themes were  There were three themes  Why don't you wanna fuck me anymore?  Will you please fuck me?  And fuck you  Alright?  So it was like a bunch of that  And then like the 50th text was her pussy 
[02:37:30]  Just a picture of her pussy  And I had this  And I had this moment where I was like  Maybe I should rethink this  She put a little effort in  She held the camera up  She picked one  And the weirdest thing  You know there was more than one  Yeah of course  But the weirdest thing though  Is like two texts later  The guy who was building me a bookshelf  Texting me a picture of the bookshelf  He was building me  And I was more excited about that  About the bookshelf  Yeah I was like  I don't know if that's age or what  But I was like  You know I don't have to be afraid  I was in that  Yeah the other thing 
[02:38:00]  I don't know  But we're dating  And it ends up like fucking  Like she comes to LA  And I can't  You know I yelled at her  I made her cry  I did all the bullshit  That I usually do  And she's still here  And now I can't do it anymore  You know what she says to me  I'm going on the road  We had a mature conversation  About trust  She says look  I know you're going on the road  I just want you to know  If you fuck anybody  On the road  I'm gonna fuck people you know  What's her name?  I just thought that was very  You know in  In lieu of the ability to trust 
[02:38:30]  You make a deal  You negotiate  Would you be mad if she fucked  Like people  Like if she fucked around on you  Is that  Do you like her that much?  Well you know I  Before this I dated this  This stripper  This uh  This woman who you know  Was basically you know  A hand job hooker  Dominatrix woman  And I was experimenting  With not giving a fuck  And you do  Well if I'm emotionally invested  I can't handle it  You can't do it  Can you?  Who the fuck wants to  Like if she fucked you  That would be disgusting  Because then I'd fucking hate you  Right  I'd hate her  I have to you know 
[02:39:00]  And then I have to worry about like you know  What kind of fuck you were  I mean I should be beyond that  Shouldn't I?  Yeah  I should  No you shouldn't be  You're not fucking an asshole  We still doing this?  You got it?  You got it?  I'm not sure  We might have found  Hold on  I had to be a little sneaky  Because obviously a lot of these girls  Are probably married  Right right  Pick her up on a background search service  Yeah  And get her married name  And then go back into it  So I think I have  I think this is your ex Anthony  Yeah  From what?  High school days  Wait a minute 
[02:39:30]  But the problem with it  Is that I can't see more pictures  Like she's like private on Facebook  Oh shit  Wait a minute  Yep absolutely that's her  So I can't see more without  Without being her friend  Wow  Damn it  Alright look  God damn  Hold on  She's got an elementary school picture of herself  And that is  Yeah that's her  But you know what that means  Did you go to elementary school with her?

[02:40:30]  Very good Danny by the way  Because that's amazing  That was very fast  Try mine  You found somebody I went out with in 19 fucking 80  Jesus  Three  I was fucking 13  Whatever it was  I was fucking 13 too  I don't  Jesus  Alright we go on to the next one  The woman I lost my virginity to was like older than me  She was a waitress at a restaurant I worked at  I wonder  I don't even know if she could  I have no idea where the hell she is  I'm hoping that's how she spells it 
[02:41:00]  I think that right  How old did  How far back is this one Anthony?  This one goes back to 1983  1983  Yeah  How old are you?  I'm up there  Oh  I'm getting there  I'm trying to figure that out  I graduated high school in 81  I think I got laid for the first time in 79  Yeah we're right there  We're in the same fucking  I graduated in 89  St. Paul Park  That DOB's  Is that about right?  That DOB's correct  So it's one of those maybe? 
[02:41:30]  Well she's married  You wanna give her a call?  I got her phone number  That's weird man  That's just fucking weird  God damn  Wait which one is she though?  Well it's all the same  Danny's great  The listing that I'm showing you here  Danny is fucking the most amazing computer guy ever  Wow  That's every different way that she's applied for credit  In probably like the last 30 years  I do different names  She's applying for credit under different names  That's all the same girl?  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Alright let's take a look  It's a list of how many times she's rejected  On a loan 
[02:42:00]  That's almost creepy that he has that information  I know  That easily  That easily  There's a wham  It's right the fuck there  Not even that easily  They can get your home address  It's Danny  I had a fan get my home address  And she sent it to me just to say  Look I can get this  Yeah yeah  I have interesting fans  She'll probably be moving  I had a fan just come over my house once  Yeah  Just knocked on my door  And fucking  Surprise  Came to my house and said  I found out where you lived  So I figured I'd stop by  I know  I was thinking  I was so rude that you told me to not  I couldn't come in 
[02:42:30]  Yeah yeah no you know what  You know what it was though  I did what you're told never to do  I was like  You fucked him?  I actually told him  Danny was over  In the back  So I told him  Yeah come on in  Have a beer you know  And go into the backyard  By the picnic table thing  Or fucking whatever table out in the back  And he got  Because I wanted to know who the fuck he was  Yeah  If I just send him away like  Get the fuck out of here 
[02:43:00]  Now he knows where I live  And I know nothing about him  And he's angry  So I figured alright here  Have a beer  I found out where he lived  Yeah  His name  His wife  How many kids he had  And then I fucking gave all the info to my FBI buddy  You did?  Did a whole fucking background check on him  Found out everything about him  And just  He's just some guy  He wasn't dangerous  Never had a record or anything  Well I think that's the right way to go  I think if you have somebody who's a stalker  Yes  You invite him in  You take him to lunch  And you'll disappoint them  Exactly  Gravely  Oh yeah 
[02:43:30]  And they're like  Oh I thought you were something  Fucking 45 on my hip  Did you?  Oh yeah  Cause I always carry  In my house  What else?  Like what am I gonna run upstairs  And get a gun if someone comes in my house?  But I mean was it during the day?  You're just wandering around  You get up  You strap on your six shooter  And you walk around your house?  Yeah  Like I  Alright  Around my house  I'm always carrying  Okay  Always  You know what  No you know what  And people say  Wow that's really fucking weird  But it's just like  My wallet being in my pocket 
[02:44:00]  But wait your doors are locked  Right  Sometimes  For the most part  Yeah  You never heard of a fucking  Kick in home invasion?  I don't get the fact that  No I get it  You have a gun on your side  Okay you've been waiting for this moment  Your whole fucking adult life  I have not  Fuck you have an armory in your house  I like shooting  You have a SWAT uniform somewhere  I know that  A ninja outfit  I have 5'11 clothing  You've been waiting  You've been waiting for this to happen  To some random lunatic  To show up at your door  And you let the fucker in?  Yes 
[02:44:30]  Because you're scared of what?  I know  I know the use of deadly physical force rules  And that did not apply  You can't have a guy going  Hi  I know where you live  And you shoot him in the face  Did you unbutton it though?  Did you unbutton your gun  Before you answered the door?  I don't have a button holster  Okay alright so  But you could've shot him  If he was on your property  You could've said whatever the fuck you wanted  No you can't  You can't just shoot him  There's no castle doctrine in New York  You can't just shoot somebody  In New Mexico you can  Yeah if someone just walks in your house  You could shoot him  In New York you can't do that  You have to feel that your life 
[02:45:00]  Or a loved one's life  Or somebody else's life  Is in danger  And that there's no course of retreat  And that the attack is continuing  As you shoot them  If they stop the attack  They can attack you  You don't shoot them  If they  The second they cease the attack  You then cannot shoot them again  Oh you're so ready to shoot someone  You really can't  No I just know when I can  I just know when I can  I know  I absolutely know when I can  And when I can  People come to your house  And you're like  Fuck just do something  I know 
[02:45:30]  I saw a couple of people  Let's just say that I might consider suspicious in my yard  And if I would've shot them  My pool wouldn't have gotten clean that day  So some mistakes could be made  Have you ever  Did you ever want a gun that you could  Do you ever think about making a gun  That you could actually shoot out on your wrists  On like a track  I haven't had those wacky fantasies like that  No  I went to the range yesterday  With a SP-89  It's the civilian model of the gun you see every bad guy using  The MP5  Every bad guy using in every 80s movie 
[02:46:00]  What's the gun that actually looks like a little box  And then it folds out  It's a machine gun that folds out  Oh like a MAC-10 or a Tec-9  Yeah but it looks like a radio  Or you can disguise it  Oh I've seen that thing  Yeah it's prototype  I saw that thing  It's like a prototype  It's not real  Where I grew up in Albuquerque  There were guns everywhere  Because there's very lax gun control  Like in high school  The kids were like  Hey look at this  I got this from my dad's drawer  Someone shot a guy  In Reno just to watch him die  Just to watch him die  My buddy Dave  They shot his car  They shot it 
[02:46:30]  Like just driving around  Some guy just shot his car  Shot his car  And then there was another gun pulled  My dad had guns  It's fun to shoot guns  It is fun  I'm not a hunter  I don't like killing things  I like going to the range  Fucking shooting paper  Being ready to kill people  It's fucking fun to just  A challenge  Yeah  To try to hit your mark  Are you good?  I'm not as good as I'd like to be  I'm good at certain ranges  With certain guns  Do you wear those silly glasses?  Well I gotta wear you know  The safety glasses  Yeah  And the ear things  Yesterday  Yeah I was shooting 
[02:47:00]  I was shooting the 9mm  And I had this fucking  Dr. Steve gave me a gun  Like a year and a half ago  Yeah  And I never fired it  Until yesterday  It's made by the same people  That put out the Desert Eagle  Which I also have a .50 caliber  Fucking pistol  Now with the targets  Do you order like the Jew target  And the black guy target  No  Black guys  No  It's usually  The old Muggsy one  Where it's just that guy  They haven't updated it since  Fucking Al Capone 
[02:47:30]  You just order a Sammy Davis target  Ah shit  Ah shit  I just went to Spencer's  And got the fucking  Jackson 5 poster  Oh shit  Fucking Danny found my ex  But the search has stopped  And she's not on Facebook  I don't think  That's what she went to college for  So she's definitely doing that  For a living  For Facebook  That's her new name  Cause she's married I guess  Oh  We can't go any further 
[02:48:00]  There's no images  No images of her  She's a little tougher  Well I can't  She doesn't seem to be on Facebook  Can you hit image  And just see if there's any images  Yeah I already did that also  Danny did a pretty good job  I think we might have got  A dead end on mine  Danny is fucking amazing  We know where she fucking works  And there's a website  For where she works  But no postures  We'll do this one  She's probably smart right  It might be two L's  First name is Amy  Yeah she was alright  Good company  She working at a good company  She's in the health field  I got girls I went to high school with  On Facebook that I see 
[02:48:30]  It's just bizarre  Because I don't see  Like I'm just now  Starting to see myself aging  Like just now  Like my face is  You know kind of  It's kind of getting  Weird shape  Weird shape  Like my  The hair is fucking going wrong  You know what I mean  I can't  You start growing hair  Where you never grew it before  That's the worst  That's the worst  Because like it happens so quickly  The ear shit happens as quick  As the shit on your face  The ear hair stuff is bad  Because actually the wind  Will hit it certain ways  And it whistles  In your ear 
[02:49:00]  Do you ever get tickled  By your own ear hair  Like what the fuck  But now I see it happen  Like I see pictures of myself  And I'm saying  When the fuck did that happen  My head looks a little  Too big to me  Yeah but have you ever seen  A guy your same age  That just works  Five days a week  Eight hours a day  For the last fucking  Dude  Oh my god  It's just terrible  I mean yeah  It's like a death march  Who are we getting now?  Ant's sort of a dead end  That's probably her  I'm at a dead end  I don't think I'm at a dead end  That was fucking  Well you got her 
[02:49:30]  Facebook page  She just doesn't have  Current pictures  That's all the info  I would have needed  Did you put in that other word  In my search Danny?  As a search word?  I did everything  Alright  I did everything  Yeah I think Danny did everything  He's good that way  That's almost crazy  What are we looking at?  Hang on  Oh wait  I'm gonna go on iChatter  I think they shut that app down  Because of us  Yep  They did  And I still have it though  Those don't look like  It had to be because of us  Those don't look like her  Some asshole out there 
[02:50:00]  Blew the whistle  I'll keep looking  Yeah well maybe  I just know this was a girl  That gave me my first blowjob  And it was so spectacular  It was such an amazing thing  That it happened  Like it was that moment  Where you're looking down  And you're going this  This is happening  This is the best thing  That's ever happened  In my life  But we never really dated  And I made that weird mistake  Where she'd given me one blowjob  And a weird night  And we'd had a couple drinks  You know beside a park  You made assumptions  Yeah and then like  I came back after a year of college  I called her up  And I literally was like  Hey and I just drove her  To the mountain 
[02:50:30]  How about another blowjob?  Basically  Can we do that again?  Because I can't seem  To make that happen at college  And you're gonna suck my cock  Fuck  Fucking Mel  Mel Gibson  You're fucking Mel Gibson  In your car  How about another blowjob?  Cunt  Then cunt  On your side?  All the first girls  I used to fuck when I was young  Were fat  Really?  They had fat girl names too  The Blouse  And Kimba  The Blouse  Kimba  I used to like big girls 
[02:51:00]  Kimba?  Kimba  I used to call it Kimba the white lion  The white lion was a cartoon  She was just a round fatty  Yeah  That nobody knew I was fucking her either  It took me so long to figure out how to fuck  I spent so many years cumming in my pants  Like I was the guy  Like I'd fucking just dry ball  Till I blew my load  And then I'd spill something on my pants  So I didn't feel like an asshole  Oh shit  To hide the fact that I had cum in my pants  In your pants  I had spilled shit  Wow  I guess the night's over  I made cumsies once just making out with a girl 
[02:51:30]  Just once  Did you really?  Not even touch  Not even no rubbing yet  Nothing  You just did it with your mind?  I guess  That's fucking amazing  One of the worst sexual experiences I ever gave a girl in her life  Was upstate New York  She didn't want to have sex at first  It was one of these things where it was like  We were in this bed in this cabin  And it was just me and our friends that were all paired off with each other  With guy and girl  Yeah  So I'm with her 
[02:52:00]  And I had a fucking rod  All night long  Cause just thinking about  And we were sleeping in the same bed  She had a bra and panties on  Oh god  And I could touch her  But like  She didn't want to fuck  And I was just in a frenzy  In a fucking frenzy  Blue balls the next day  Where I couldn't stand up and walk  I was fucking hobbled  Yeah  I was fucking hobbled  Yeah  By my balls  And then the next night  Now we're there again  The next night  Yeah  She decides to let me fuck her  Yeah 
[02:52:30]  Now I'd been through the night before  The build up  The frenzy  The blue balls  Not coming  Yeah  The second my dick touched her lip  Her labia  Yeah  I fucking fire hosed  Just fire hosed  She threw up cum  It was everywhere  Like I fucking couldn't take it  Cause it had built up for 24 fucking hours  I was sitting there with a rod  You can't fucking do that  Yeah I had premature ejaculation mastered  You know from 15 to 16, 17 years old 
[02:53:00]  Jesus  You know how I learned how to fuck  The premature ejaculation  Well how easy is that?  It's like I'm done  Sorry  How easy is it?  But it took you how I learned  There's nothing you can do  Do you know how I learned how to fuck  I'm sorry  Yeah it's also  Yeah it's awful  But I've done that in my adult life  Of course  Here's how I learned how to fuck though  I dated this woman  I met in college  She was pissed off  When I met her she had a black mohawk  She was like this little tank of a chick  She had big tits  She was great  I loved her 
[02:53:30]  And she couldn't cum  And she was angry  And she would fuck me  She'd go  I wouldn't fucking cum  Because I can  I want to get the most out of this  So I literally  Jesus Christ  The pressure's on  Yeah she wrapped a pearl necklace  Around my cock once  And fucked me with it  Like  Was it real pearls?  No it was plastic  What are you doing?  Jules?  How are the pearls?  Nice  Why did I take that seriously?  I don't know  But because she was so angry  That I would possibly come too soon  She taught me how to focus  And fuck 
[02:54:00]  And I appreciate that  Oh wow  I thank her every day  Well let's try to find her now  That's nice  I know her  I fucked a chick on a bus  An abandoned bus  And I remember her pussy  She  You know when they cum  That's why I have this weak stomach  Wait an abandoned bus?  What the fuck is this?  How did we just let that go?  That part of the story  I know  Where was an abandoned bus?  In South Medford  In this back lot  There was an abandoned bus  Me and my three friends  Took this broad  I think she was half retarded  Another healthy sexual experience 
[02:54:30]  But we all fucked her on this bus  I was the last one in there  And it was either my friend's loads  Or her fucking pussy  Exploded  It was your friend's loads  Of course it was  It just shot out  Like somebody turned a faucet  On her fucking stomach  And shot out  And I remember there was like  Fucking stuff in my pubes  Oh Jesus  Did you go  Did you  Wow  Yeah that  You were close  I never did that  I never  You know the one  I never did a train thing 
[02:55:00]  Or anything like that  No I did  I was forced into all that shit though  I told you  My first sexual experience  They forced me into the bushes  You were the ringleader  With the fat chick  And she just played with my  I was in first grade  My little dinky  She was just rubbing it  His little dinky  That's all I remember  It was just a little dinky  And we were in a rhubarb bush  A rhubarb bush  A rhubarb bush  She was just playing with my dinky  And I went home that night  And cried  Oh shit  Because I thought  God was gonna kill me  And my mom kept coming  And going  What's wrong  And I was just like 
[02:55:30]  Nothing  And I had to take the hit  Because I thought  I couldn't tell my mom  That I was in a fucking rhubarb bush  With the blouse  Real perceptive mom  With the blouse  With the blouse  And saying nothing happened  And the weird words  In that story  Rhubarb bush  The blouse  A week later though  I was up in the attic  Of Tufts University  Knocked the abandoned bus  And sucking on her tits  With my friend  Really?  With your friend?  You and your friend  Were sucking on her tits?  Yeah there was two of them  It was like there was one  And it was gay  You ever see Big  When he's in the hotel room 
[02:56:00]  And he's crying the first night  Yes  And then after a couple of nights  He's just  He's watching TV  Un-fucking-believable  That's what you are  Crying and then a week later  You're sucking her tits  Beautiful  Beautiful  Oh just fat chick lying flat  On a wooden floor  Jesus  I never had  I try  I never did the thing  With another  Well I think I tried  To have a threesome  With  Yeah there was this one time  I never had a successful threesome  Have you?  With two girls?  I've never had a successful  With two girls?  No 
[02:56:30]  One time I was with a girl  This girl who liked me  Brought another chick over  Yeah  But I was way into the other girl  Cause I'd never been with her  So I bumped her off the bench  She hit her head  On the floor  See that's what always happens  Like years ago  Of course  I haven't done it recently  Where you meet these two girls  Right after I was in Los Angeles  So there was probably pills involved  And I met these two girls  At a restaurant  And they wanted to have a threesome  So we'd go to one of their houses  We'd end up on her father's bed  And there's always a crisis in these things  Like it starts out  It's like this is gonna work  And then one of them freaks out  And somebody has a meltdown 
[02:57:00]  So I'm with these two girls  And one of them starts crying  And she's packing a bag  In the next room  And now I gotta fuck her friend  At least you gotta spare  Yeah  What I was thinking  It's like don't cry out there  Crying here at least I can use it  Use it to my advantage  I had a successful one  And it wound up costing me millions  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Yeah that threesome  Didn't turn out very well  Why?  Because you ended up with the one?  No I ended up without the wife  Oh  Oh that was it? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah that didn't work  Oops  It worked for a little while  That was an expensive load  And then I got an ultimatum  It's either her or me  And I said okay later  Don't give me an ultimatum  Shit  And you know what it is  It's like yeah  You got two girls on the bed  One you've been fucking for years  Yes  One's brandy new  Right  What are you going to do?  You're going to drive your Nova  Or are you going to fucking get in the Ferrari?  Stop  It's not even a Ferrari  It's just a better Nova  It's a brand new Nova  It's a brand new Ferrari  Another mediocre chick that lets you stick your fingers in her asshole's two knuckles 
[02:58:00]  So everyone was in agreement at the beginning  Yeah yeah  It was all cool at the beginning  It was like you know  Kind of a thing  It went on for a little while  And shit like that  And then I started seeing like  Uh oh  Oh boy  You saw the face change?  Yeah yeah I saw like the  Why do you gotta like it so much?  Yeah yeah  Exactly  It was kind of like a  Well I see you're kind of getting attached there  What are you supposed to do?  Sit there fucking someone going  Not as good  Not as good  Just hang out  And then you know what the really 
[02:58:30]  Fucking fun part  The wife was like  Look uh this is cool and everything  But I don't want you fucking her unless I'm involved and stuff  I was like yeah no problem no problem  So we'd all wake up like Saturday morning fucking hungover and shit  Like a Nickelodeon on or some crap on the TV  Sure cartoons  And the wife would get up and go uh and go  Oh I'm gonna take a shower  I was like alright  The second she left the room  Me and the other girl just fucking like animals  Get done 
[02:59:00]  Roll back over  Hi  Hey  What's up?  Let's go get some breakfast  Let's get some brunch  Let's watch the Rugrats  Exactly  Clarissa explains it all  It's amazing  Love that girl  We're nothing but dead ends  We're going way back  That's the problem  We're going too far back  Can I just say one thing  Yeah yeah  I want to make it public that I've not mentioned my ex-wife once and it's been an hour and a half  No amazing  Thank you very much Mark  Thank you  You just did though  But that's okay 
[02:59:30]  I want to my own horn  I'm officially I think I'm over it  Yeah I think you're over it  Thank God  Thank God the listeners are saying that too  Are they?  No they love you actually  They love you and your stories  That fucking  But yeah I don't know if I told you that the last time like cause I thought  You know I really really thought I was over it in a deep way  Yeah  And then I you know and then I heard she had a baby right?  Oh shit  Did I tell you that?  I already told you that?  I don't know if you did on here  Like she had a baby and my first thought was like oh that's your move?  That's how you're going to play it?  A spike move  Spike baby 
[03:00:00]  It's a fucking spike baby  Spike baby  That's your move  Jesus  I actually picture myself running into her on the street with the stroller  And I'm like oh you had a baby what's his name?  She looks at me and says his name is fuck Mark Maron  Too good  Hey why don't we take a break?  What the hell?  Fuck man I wanted to see a picture of my ex from way back  I wanted you to see the forehead  I wanted to see one of mine that wasn't so way back  We got close though cause right where the picture is supposed to be where she works is just a symbol  Like what? 
[03:00:30]  That's not a good sign  It's a fucking swastika  Look it's a symbol  Obviously the picture is supposed to be right there  It's a medical symbol  What is that about?  She's doing alright  Yeah she's doing alright  She's a pathologist  She looks at dead people  Ew  Oh language pathologist  No no that's her  She looks at dead languages  Yeah  That's not even a medical profession  What's a language pathologist?  Dead languages?  It is  Just tongues  When they find just the tongue  playing on the ground  When they sit and try and make it talk  She's the one  Yeah  What did that tongue do?  Who killed you? 
[03:01:00]  What do we got?

You're a nice guy  But I don't fucking cut it when you're bullshitting and fucking around like this on set  You don't care about anyone but yourself  Rot  Unless you crawl back, suck my cock, and say you're sorry in that order  Seriously man, you and me, we're fucking done professionally  You there?  The OB and Anthony Show  The OB and Anthony Show, dammit 
[03:05:00]  Or the virus, Sirius XM  Fucking embarrassment to me  You look like a fucking bitch on heat  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers it'll be your fault  Yes  Alright?  Okay?  I don't want you  What are you talking about?  I don't believe you anymore  I don't trust you  I don't love you  I just want to go back to my room  I don't want you  Okay?  But I don't want you anymore

Please!  Do it! 
[03:06:00]  Let me have your attention for a moment  This is the OB and Anthony Show  On the virus, Sirius XM  Can't get enough of that Mel Gibson  Are you a fan of the Mel Gibson tapes, Mark Maron?  Well, you know, I'm sad to say on some level that the woman I'm going out with, she's obsessed with this stuff and she played it for me and I actually identified.  I understood the tone, not on the racial things, but I certainly have spoken in that tone to women before and it embarrassed me. I felt embarrassed for them and I definitely understand that rage. 
[03:06:30]  Really, you do. So you get the rage.  I think a lot of people understand the rage.  Well, I mean, I was talking to you about it on the break. I actually came to his defense in some ways because I watched a Joy Behar show. I don't even know why it was on, but she was on and she was calling him a misogynist and I was like, there's no indication of that. He didn't say they're all cunts. He didn't say that they're all whores. He's having a problem with one cunt and he was very, he was sexist. He was emotionally abusive. He may have been violent, but he did not say that they were all cunts. 
[03:07:00]  He didn't say that they were all cunts. Right. And a cunt, you know, cunt's a great word. If a mouth could throw a rock, Anthony, it would be cunt. Because when you throw a cunt, you're expecting the same reaction. Pain and tears.  The ex-wife hated that word to the point where it was strange how much she hated that word. It's like a trigger, yeah. I couldn't use it in any context, in any way, to a friend on the phone, nothing. Like if she heard it, she lost her fucking mind. 
[03:07:30]  You couldn't call it breakfast cereal cunts?  No, nothing like that.  Wheat cunts.  Sugar-coated cunts.  Sugar cunts.  Nothing.  Glazed cunts.  I couldn't use it.  Could not fucking use the word.  Could I get a cunt with jimmies on it?  Jimmies.  Jimmies.  I couldn't use the word.  And if we'd be arguing, which was a lot, and she'd be upstairs, like she'd storm upstairs, I'd be on the couch. 
[03:08:00]  And I'd try to be like a big tough guy, like I'm going to fucking call her a cunt.  But I wasn't tough enough.  I sat there on the couch like, yeah.  And I'd be like, as low as is possible, as low as a human could possibly talk.  Hello, hello, hello.  All right.  T.A., go upstairs.  Oh.  It was so bad.  Like you're talking behind your mom's back?  Yes.  But then, and then I'd hear, what did I hear? 
[03:08:30]  She fucking could hear that word.  She could hear that fucking word.  But the rage, man.  Oh.  I know the, I mean, I have an anger problem that I have to fucking deal with.  And I thought it was gone because of the nicotine.  And because, like, I just been, I haven't been dating anybody that I really like.  And as soon as I start going out with this chick that I like, the rage just fucking comes out.  And without the nicotine, like, I'm over nothing.  Like, she's like, well, do you really want to go out to the thing? 
[03:09:00]  And I'm like, you're fucking with my head.  Why are you fucking with my head?  Why are you trying to manipulate me?  I mean, what the fuck is that about?  And she's like, what are you talking about?  I'm like, fuck you.  I played this game before.  I'm not playing it again.  Fuck you.  Get out of my car.  But they do fuck with you, though.  They do fuck.  But they don't know that.  But they do, look, my wife will fucking, I'm taking a bag downstairs that I'm supposed to  take downstairs that she's been bugging me to take downstairs.  I put it on my back.  And she's like, do you want to?  She gives me five other options. 
[03:09:30]  It's like, you shut the fuck up.  I'm doing it.  Now I don't know what to do.  They make you fucking retarded.  It's like, should I take the elevator?  Should I go down the stairs?  Should I drag it down?  You just gave me five options.  I'm doing what the fuck you wanted me to do.  Shut the fuck up.  What scares me, though, is when it happens, when I do it, and if she starts crying, then  I'm like, oh, my God, I'm sorry.  Then I realize this is what the sickness is about.  I can't connect emotionally unless I hurt somebody.  And that's fucked up.  Yeah, but sometimes they can't do the same thing. 
[03:10:00]  They have to get to the point where you make them cry.  Wait, wait, they got to make you cry.  Well, you make them cry, and that's how they, the only way they can express themselves, because  they're holding tickets and resentment for fucking three weeks about something you did  three weeks ago, and you have to, they keep pushing your buttons till you snap, then  they cry, and then they can express what they were trying to fucking three weeks ago.  Yeah, but this is not healthy.  Whatever you just described cannot be what most people go through.  Of course it's not healthy.  I mean, this is what we go through.  Yes.  Most people don't go through that shit. 
[03:10:30]  Why are we so fucked up?  People who like us aren't healthy either.  No, I understand that, and I thank God for them.  Yeah.  But I still don't understand why.  Just because they're a woman and they cry doesn't mean they're fucking healthy.  No, I know that, but it does mean I feel bad, and eventually they'll stop crying and go  away and find a guy that doesn't make them cry and pretend like they love them and have  their baby.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry, what just came out?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that'll happen.  That'll come out.  That's just blurred out.  No, I just, I got a problem, and all I know is that, like, I packed the, 
[03:11:00]  uh, anger management books that I bought as a symbolic gesture during my second marriage  with me.  Oh, like, you know, I'm not gonna need, oh, like, you might need these.  Well, no, I brought, I bought them, you know, saying, like, I'm gonna deal with it, baby.  I'm gonna deal with it.  So you buy the books, you're like, ah, I got them.  Got the books.  And that's it.  You don't read the fucking books.  You just beat them with the books?  Yeah.  How ironic would that be?  Yeah, yeah.  Where's my fucking anger management book?  A woman beaten by her husband's anger management book.  So I brought them with me.  Just put it in her throat and push it like they do in the karate movies. 
[03:11:30]  Cough.  But I got them, so I, like, I want to deal with it now.  I just, I can't, you know, I'm too old for this shit, and I don't want to hurt anybody  anymore.  And I'm just gonna have to learn how to, uh, to, to emotionally connect without the  crying.  Yeah.  It's gonna be a hard road.  It's a toughie.  If a girl cries, though, I don't care what they, if they were dead wrong, if, if she  cried, I'm fucking finished.  That's right.  Yeah.  I'm done.  I don't care if I catch her sucking my father's dick.  I'm like, I must've did something.  I didn't mean to suck this cock. 
[03:12:00]  It's just that you're never home, and you're in Columbus, Ohio, all week.  I'm sorry.  Good way to get the plug in, though.  Then you're in Helium in Philly, and I don't know what I'm gonna do when I'm gonna suck  his dick.  Look at this creep guy in his chat.  I thought, oh, no, you can't get the app anymore, but if you have it, you could still  use it.  They shut down the iChat, right?  You can't get it.  If you have it, you can use it.  If you have it, you could use it.  And it happened right after you promoted on the show, Bobby.  It's all cock.  I think we were the ones. 
[03:12:30]  I had the greatest game in the world going at the cellar.  Every night, we'd play, uh, Guess If the Cock's Coming.  And you'd have to swipe, go yes or no, and then wait.  And it would just be such a buildup.  Like, it would just be a guy, a guy and his girl, a fucking dog, someone with a mask on,  and then just a fucking huge, uncircumcised cock, like a guy in a tub with no water.  And everybody screams, look at my dick!  What is this?  What are you talking about?  It's called iChatter.  Oh, okay.  You don't have the iPhone there, Mark, I see. 
[03:13:00]  No, I don't have any.  I can barely...  You're giving up on technology?  No, I'm not giving up.  It's just that, I got enough things going on in my fucking brain.  I don't know where everyone finds the time to do this shit.  I can barely TiVo fucking TV shows.  I don't know where people have time to watch shit.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, sorry.  What the hell was that?  That was old school.  Someone said...  Well, no.  Sorry.  I'm showing Bobby how my iPhone is broken.  And he doesn't know how it broke.  I don't know how that happened.  Do you think I need to get the iPhone?  Because I'd still get the BlackBerry.  You probably had it in your pocket, and you fucking popped a heart on.  I know. 
[03:13:30]  I didn't drop it, because look at the corner.  It's not even...  There's no dent or anything in the side.  It just...  It's like somebody dropped something on it when it was sitting on...  But I remember it being on the arm of my couch, and then I just remember it being broken.  Do you have guests at your house all the time, right?  No, I had a party.  Yeah, so I would fucking smash it.  But also, too, is that your parties, you probably don't remember...  Do you carry a gun at the party?  Matt, you probably don't remember fucking smashing it.  Nah, it depends on what kind of party it is.  If it's a gun party? 
[03:14:00]  If it's a gun...  If it's a...  Yes, a gun party?  I never thought of that.  That sounds fun.  You gotta have a gun party.  Gun party?  No, if it's like...  If there's gonna be kids around and stuff like that, then I lock them all up.  You lock the kids up?  Yeah, I lock the kids up.  Not the guns.  What are you, crazy?  Might be an invasion.  Get a baby gate and stick them in a fucking room?  But other than that, you know... 
[03:14:30]  And then if I'm...  Obviously, I can't swim in the pool with a fucking gun.  Is this part of the plan, Bobby?  Oh, shit, part of the plan!  Egg whites?  What do you have to say?  It's got ham.  It's got yellow right there.  There's yellow there.  There's ham.  That's yolk and fucking...  I can't help it if they fucked up egg whites.  It's egg whites.  He just yelled at me like, there's yellow in the egg white.  How is it egg white?  It's egg whites.  It's egg white with some hands.  Are you watching what you eat is what I'm asking.  Dude, I'm back to fucking focusing on one shitty habit.  Okay. 
[03:15:00]  And that's my fucking awful eating habits.  It's terrible the way I eat.  Okay.  It's just terrible.  So this is good?  Dude, it's either this.  It's either I...  I'm sorry.  This is it.  I'm pointing at it.  No, no.  Egg whites is good.  Egg whites are good.  Egg whites are fantastic.  But this is the thing.  Why are you pointing so close?  Either I...  Well, because you're right here.  All right.  Your head's big.  It is a big head.  Which means fame.  Which means fame.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's what happens to you, Phil.  Jesus Christ.  Well, you could shave that if you wanted to.  I know, I know, I know.  Dude, either I don't eat or I fucking just... 
[03:15:30]  I just fucking plow it in my face.  But I'm just saying this is healthy for you.  The ham, though.  That's what I was asking.  Yeah, it's protein.  I understand.  I'm going out...  The woman going out is vegetarian.  She's got me eating pretty well.  You shit so much better if you don't eat fucking meat.  Dude, it's a pain in the ass.  Well, not pain in the ass.  I haven't been eating meat.  Like, being with a vegetarian is a pain in the fucking ass.  It's hard to cook for them, and it's hard to go out to eat because a little...  Yeah, it's like always...  Is there meat in that?  Was it cooked with meat?  Is that broth?  Was there chicken broth?  Was there ever a cow next to the fucking thing that I'm eating? 
[03:16:00]  Well, it's still cute right now.  It's only been a month.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to get a little fast.  Oh, man, it's adorable.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you're fucking sitting there at a restaurant going, I can't eat anything on the menu,  and you're looking at something you really want, and then you just got to get up and leave.  Yeah, that's where you go.  Well, they go to a fucking other restaurant.  Yeah, exactly.  Why do we got to go through this all the time?  And then they get pissed off also at this one, but I kind of agree with this, and I told  this girl I was with...  Well, I told Melinda.  Yeah, you know Melinda.  I told her to come back to the waiter with a fucking line or something, because they always 
[03:16:30]  say, we can take the meat off for you, off of that salad, or something like that.  And it's like, I told her, just tell the guy, look, if someone shit on your steak, and then  said, well, we'll take the shit off, would you eat it?  Like, just tell the guy that.  And it never really works, because even if they take the meat off, she'll be eating it,  and like a hunk of pork, like pig skin will be hanging out of her mouth.  She would never eat something that had meat on it and then was taken off. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, but the thing is, it's like, she could say, I want a whole other salad, and they'd  go, yes, I'll bring you that.  And then they go back and they just take the meat off.  But they could tell, like, they got some vegetarian six-cent shit.  I respect it.  Like, yeah, I think there was meat in there.  And then they get sick, like, the next day.  I think there was chicken broth in that.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Oh, well.  I respect it, though.  Fucking eating.  I respect it.  I don't.  It's in the cute stage, though, Mark.  Yeah, it's still like...  Let's explore the cute stage with Mark and his new girl.  It is.  It is.  What's cute about herself at this point?  Well, I mean, she's...  Come on, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  What's cute right now that's going to get old? 
[03:17:30]  Oh, Jesus.  What's cute now that's going to get old?  That's perfect.  That's right.  Well, the vegetarian eating...  Because you know.  You've been around a long time.  You know that's going to get old.  It's cute.  Her glasses are cute.  Like, she's kind of quirky, and she says stupid shit.  She has no filter on her mouth, which I think is great.  That's cute until all of a sudden she says it to the wrong guy.  You're like, holy shit, I might have to fight this animal because of you.  She brought that up last night.  Really?  Yeah.  She said, look, you know, if I'm ever shooting my mouth off, you don't have to step in, all right?  Because I'm going to fight him. 
[03:18:00]  I'll just watch him get the shit beat out of you while I stand aside.  That'd be fucking great to watch a girl get her fucking teeth chipped by some fucking black dude.  Some dude begging for change.  You got money?  Fuck you, kink.  Jesus Christ.  I'd love to see my wife get her ass beat by fucking some guy.  Just to go at the end, just go, see, you do need me.  You do need me and my fucking buck knife.  I think you've got a plan.  You can make that happen.  I have a fucking knife to defend myself.  You can make that happen. 
[03:18:30]  That sounds like Fargo.  Yeah.  Oh.  You love Fargo?  Huh?  We love Fargo.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's a great movie.  I was just in Minneapolis.  End of story.  I had a monsoon the night I was performing up there.  The Mall of America?  No.  I just did a rock club.  Fuck the comedy clubs already.  They don't want to work me.  What am I supposed to do?  I like that.  That's fucking weird.  You're booking yourself.  Who's doing that?  That's fucking great.  I just like, it's like, what do I got to go sit and wait for one of these little Napoleons  to put me on their fucking club, you know, and not promote me?  And they all, they don't like me. 
[03:19:00]  The comedy club guys, for some reason, they're just not using me.  So I go into a rock club.  But you're not going in and you're not fucking trying to kill it and smoke it out and fucking  pack the place every fucking night?  I would.  They don't give me the chance.  Really?  So I just, I went to Minneapolis.  I booked the Triple Rock Social Club.  We had a great time.  A few hundred people came.  That's great.  I did a great show.  I brought in my own opener.  And I left.  I left with some money and I didn't have to answer to anybody.  It was spectacular.  I mean, I don't know if it's going to sustain me and I got nothing against the comedy club  system, but they've been a little weird with me. 
[03:19:30]  It's like, I don't know what I got to do to get work.  I got a couple of places I go, like laughs in Seattle.  I like, I used to do helium and stuff, but that guy, he's not, he's not moving me.  And I draw now and I don't get it.  So I'm fucking, I'll go do rock the club.  I'll do rock the club.  It's a Radisson, so it's pretty good.  Yeah, but you'd rather go in and do one night and do what you did and have your fans come  up.  It's not, you don't have to worry about fucking them giving 50 tickets to a bachelorette party  and the whole front is fucking tiaras and sashes.  If I can make it work, you know, because the podcast. 
[03:20:00]  And there's no food there, right?  Nothing.  No.  You don't have to deal with the fucking checks being thrown on the table as you're trying  to finish up.  The fucking checks bought at some of these clubs.  It's unbelievable.  I get so mad every time I go and see you guys and you're obviously rolling into your  final bit.  Last fucking ten minutes.  You want to slam them.  Ten minutes.  You want to do a Chris Rock slam, that fucking microphone down and you look out and realize  half the people aren't listening because they have to pay their checks now.  And they drop, they drop as someone in the audience.  All the checks all at once. 
[03:20:30]  Nobody gives a fuck.  Bill Burr calls it carpet bombing.  Carpet bombing.  Yeah, they carpet bomb the tables just when you're hitting your last solid, this is the  bit I want people to remember.  You have to have a bit that you don't give a fuck about, that will keep their attention  a little bit, that you can do in that spot.  It's fucking terrible.  You know, if I see the checks go down, why don't you just say, like, okay, let's get  this taken care of.  I'm just going to hang out for a second.  Yeah.  It's not a bad idea.  You could do that, yeah.  But then you lose the energy, right?  No.  No, you wouldn't lose your...  No, I mean, because they're going to stop the roll anyways.  You might hang on to, like, what, 20 out of 150 people that aren't going to worry 
[03:21:00]  about their checks.  So why not just say, all right, if this is what we're going to do, tip your waitresses.  Are we good?  And just wait it out.  All right, let's go back in.  There's a better way to do that, man.  There is.  I'll tell you what it is.  The seller does it.  You get a ticket.  You can't leave with a ticket or receipt.  You come in, you can't leave without showing the receipt.  That's it.  So you don't need to do a fucking check spot.  You pay your bill.  You can't leave the place without showing your stamped receipt or ticket.  That's it.  And no one will fucking do that.  The sad thing about, like, what I was talking about before is that, like, I've been working 
[03:21:30]  for, what, 25 years.  I've never been fucking funnier.  Now I'm finally getting some people coming out, and I don't work comedy clubs.  You will, though.  You will, and you don't fucking, what you're doing is great.  Fucking, you'd rather go in.  Would you rather, do you really want to come in on a fucking Wednesday?  No, I don't.  I don't.  And go to Sunday?  I don't.  But there's some part of me that's sort of like, I know the people who are deciding this.  It's like, why are you deciding that, like, you know, a guy that's barely hanging on  to his last comic standing success from four seasons ago is a better option to book 
[03:22:00]  in your fucking club than me?  Wow.  They don't book Voss.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  But I'm not even bitter about it.  I've never been happier in my life about my fucking stand-up and about where it's going.  I've always liked your stand-up.  Thank you, man.  Always, always, always, always.  Saw you for the first time at the Cellar.  Fallen, you ever since?  I would so rather see you in a fucking rock club than a fucking comedy club.  Dude, to fucking see somebody, oh, just those, they give the free, the VIPs, they give 
[03:22:30]  the front row to fucking free tickets, or they're friends, not your fans, to people  that don't even give a fuck about you, and you wonder why, you know, if comedy, the front  row should be two seats.  It should be two, two, two.  There's no way the front row should be fucking ten people, a group of ten.  Fuck that.  Doing a rock and roll club, no food, your fans, you get to decide how many tickets are  given out, if any, for free, and it's just, fuck that.  That is so fucking logical. 
[03:23:00]  No, because it's always a table of ten, and they all know each other right in the front  row, or that's where they put the fucking bachelorette parties and shit.  Put that shit in the back, you're right.  If there are people that don't know me, if they don't know me and they're sitting in the  first two rows, they're going to see right through to the sadness.  I did a club, and I, I did a club that, the guy told him, I go, look, there was like five  bachelorette parties.  I go, dude, do not fucking put them up front.  I don't want to see a sash or a tiara anywhere. 
[03:23:30]  He went up to them, the manager of the club went up to them and told them that I don't  like bachelorette parties.  If you talk, he's really going to fucking snap, and we'll have to keep, yeah, and then  they didn't talk the whole show.  He scared the shit out of them, which is great.  I didn't mind.  But I went to a, the party after at some bar, they, like this whole group, why do you  hate us?  Why don't we like you?  And I was like, oh, fuck.  Un-fucking-believable.  You know, I made a lot of mistakes, you know, coming up, because I never understood that 
[03:24:00]  what you had to do when you went into a club was, was kill, make nice, make the, nice  with the waitstaff, make nice with the manager, you know, plant some seats for the next time  around.  I really just thought it was all about me and making people uncomfortable.  I mean, I didn't even realize, I had to learn this lesson about, about, like, I really thought  it was all about me.  And one time I was in Chicago, and this is about respecting the staff and everything.  I'm in Chicago at Zaney's, right?  There's like nine people in the house.  It's like a Wednesday.  It's the first show of the week.  Nine people.  My favorite show.  All right?  The host brings me up. 
[03:24:30]  I did an hour and a half, an hour and 45 minutes for nine people, right?  And I felt fucking, it was great, right?  But I said, okay, thank you.  That's my time.  Let's bring the host back.  And no one comes on stage.  And from the bar, I hear the bartender say, he went home.  Holy shit.  And it was like, it was at that moment I realized, oh my God, these people aren't here to serve  me.  They have lives.  They saw nine people and thought, this guy will be off in 40 minutes.  Why would he want to do that?  And the waitress had gone home.  The host had gone home.  And I was a fucking asshole for the rest of the week. 
[03:25:00]  And that guy spoke for everybody.  Yeah, exactly.  We are all fucking pissed.  Exactly.  And I was like, holy shit.  I lost and I had to be the last guy here until you finished up.  Right.  What was your worst stand-up experience, Bobby?  Last night, Bobby.  Last night.  This week has been bad.  I'm trying to fucking do new shit at the cellar.  No, but not bombing.  Not bombing even.  Just a bad fucking experience.  And I had to be upstate New York.  My agent booked me at a black underground nightclub. 
[03:25:30]  That was doing a comedy series.  What's your agent's name?  Can I get right that down?  We're all black comics.  The poster was black, black, black, me.  Bob.  Black, black, black.  Black, black, black, black.  Yeah, I just stuck out.  I was the manager, the promoter of the fucking gig.  And it was so bad.  It looked like a run-down gas station.  But at night, inside, they redid the whole thing.  The guy who ran it was a legitimate gangster and pimp.  Honestly, you know, really.  And then I went in, and the guy, the MC, hated that he was bringing guys from New York up. 
[03:26:00]  He wanted to be the fucking headliner.  And he was telling me, he was like, yeah, I don't know why he won't give me a shot, man.  We're friends.  I've known him.  I can kill this motherfucker.  But he keeps bringing you guys up, and he won't give me a fucking shot.  Who did he bring up from New York?  Anybody we know?  Fucking Keith.  Yeah, all the fucking black guys were going up there.  And then the guy went up, killed it, the MC.  I went up.  I fucking bombed 20 seconds into my thing. 
[03:26:30]  Nothing.  A bombing for a black crowd is like there's a vacuum to it.  Because it was sold out.  It was fucking sold out.  Because they will let you hang.  No, they look at you.  Yeah, they do.  They stare right at you.  Like, go ahead, keep going.  This guy yelled some shit out halfway through.  Like, you suck, motherfucker.  I did the fucking hack.  Fuck you, man.  I didn't go to your job and fucking wipe the...  And I got a couple laughs.  Yeah.  And it went back and forth a little bit.  This guy was coming to the stage to literally kill me. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  They had to grab him.  He was like, I'm going to fucking kill you.  Yeah.  And I looked, and he was that fucking...  That long fucking African king body where it's just shredded.  It looks like there's no skin.  It's just muscle.  Yeah.  With a fucking wife beater and a gold nugget around his neck.  No skin.  And what happened?  And they had to grab him, take him out.  I fucking went back to my act, bombed for another 25 minutes.  And then he had to be afraid to leave the place. 
[03:27:30]  No.  Not over yet.  The coast went back up and went, see, motherfucker?  You're bringing these motherfuckers up.  Trashed me.  Killed on trashing me while I was still in the room.  There was no way out of the room, by the way.  The room was the room.  There was no other room to go to.  I was in the room.  He goes...  A big black guy comes up and goes, yo, with a microphone, yo, you're going to go defend yourself.  We were going to have a fucking joke off.  Oh, what the fuck is this now?  A guy like Kenny grabbed me with the same type of voice.  You have to go up there. 
[03:28:00]  You mind if we dance with your dates?  Yeah, that guy.  He came up, said, you have to go up.  I was like, no, I'm cool.  I'm cool.  It's fine.  It's fine.  He grabbed me.  No, you gots too.  You gots too?  Brings me up.  The guy starts yelling from the stage, motherfucker, fuck that.  This is my house.  Fuck you, dude.  Don't bring him up here, because he thought I might get a chance at him, and he didn't  bring me up.  He grabbed me and said, forget it.  Took me down.  They made me sit there for three hours after that.  What the fuck?  It was a three-hour comedy.  That's a pretty bad gig. 
[03:28:30]  It turns into a night...  Yeah, that is a really bad fucking gig.  It turned into a nightclub.  They put him in a cell.  As soon as the show's over, it turns into a black nightclub.  It turns into the club.  I sat there for three hours, and then I finally went up to the guy.  I go, sir.  I called him sir at this point.  I go, can you please give me a ride back to my hotel?  Threw his keys to his fucking 13-year-old nephew, and he drove me back to the hotel.  I took the money.  It was all cash.  $2,500.  Great paying gig, by the way.  $2,500.  I put it in every fucking orifice of my body and went directly to the train station, hid 
[03:29:00]  between a fountain and a Coke machine until the train came the next day.  That's a great story.  You're a mess.  That's a bad night.  That is a bad night.  It was a horrible, horrible gig.  Good story.  It was a bad night.  I can't top that.  It was bad.  You got one like that, though?  Worst experience?  My worst experience was I was sent home from Australia.  I was rejected by a country.  I was sent home from a fucking country, and it was because of what we were talking about  with the nerves.  I took this gig.  I knew this would happen. 
[03:29:30]  I was in New York, and back when I was living here, like, maybe 89, 92 it was, when I moved  to San Francisco, all right?  The guy who books this club in Australia saw me in New York at the improv, the old improv  on 44th.  And he asked me, he said, you want to come headline the room in Australia?  It was called The Last Laugh, I think, for four weeks.  It was a four-week run.  Jesus Christ.  And it's like three, and they add a week, so it's all big fix, so it's a whole season  you're there.  And I got this contract, and I knew at that time, I was a middle at best, a strong middle. 
[03:30:00]  I had 35 minutes.  That's what I had all in, okay?  All in.  All in.  I had about 35.  And I knew when I'm looking at this contract, I'm going to go to Australia.  I don't even like to travel.  It was the first time I got sober, so I'm newly sober, and I'm going, I'm doing this.  So I signed the contract, I send it off, and from the moment I sent that thing away, I'm  like, what the fuck did I do?  What the fuck did I do?  Total lack of confidence.  Oh, yeah.  It just starts breaking down months away from the gig.  All right, so now I moved to San Francisco. 
[03:30:30]  I'm sober about maybe six, seven months, and I'm flying to Australia.  It's like 20 hours, you know, to get there.  I got to go through New Zealand.  Who the fuck knows?  I got to stop in Hawaii, New Zealand.  I get to Melbourne.  I get off the plane.  I'm already freaking out.  We're on the wrong side of the road.  Literally, I see kangaroos, like, alongside the highway.  I'm like, where the fuck am I?  And they're like, we're going to do a TV show.  So I go do this TV show, but it looks like the David Letterman show, except that the whole  set is on the wrong side.  Because they're south of the equator.  The desk is on the wrong side. 
[03:31:00]  The band's not in the right place.  And the guy who's supposed to be hosting it, he doesn't even host.  He's off, and it's some woman.  I don't know any of them.  And the other guest is Russell Crowe.  There's celebrities from there?  No, it was, but it was Russell Crowe.  He was on the show promoting Romper Stomper, that first movie he did.  Yeah, yeah.  The Nazi movie.  Right.  Yeah, it was a good one.  He's back, I'm backstage with this young Russell Crowe.  I like that one.  I'm freaking out.  I like him for different reasons.  Oh.  I'm freaking out they're not going to get any of my shit.  And I'm back there with Russell Crowe, who's just exuding confidence. 
[03:31:30]  And he's like, so you're a comedian?  I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  I don't know.  I gotta try.  That's bad.  I don't know.  So I do my set, and it goes all right, but they're a little weird, and I don't know if  they're getting me or whatever.  And then I'm sitting down next to Russell, who's doing panel.  Like, I move over a chair, and there's Russell Crowe.  He's talking about preparing for Romper Stomper, which is just, he plays a Nazi.  And he's talking about what books he had to read.  Like, I read Mein Kampf by Hitler, and I read these. 
[03:32:00]  He's talking about all these Nazi books.  So I make a joke.  I'm like, this sounds like the books I have on my bookshelf.  You know, like, and of course, they didn't know me well enough to know.  Oh, no.  So I just get one of those, like, what you did to me earlier, like, nothing.  I didn't do that.  I didn't do that.  They did it.  Okay, whatever.  Stop blaming me.  All right.  So, but you said nothing.  So anyway, so I, uh.  I was just observing.  I know, I know.  So then there's that moment, right?  So that doesn't go well.  So then I get to the club, and they got a huge billboard in me, right? 
[03:32:30]  Which I couldn't handle.  That just meant, like, I can't live up to that billboard.  It's fine.  I'm sorry.  You can't live up to the billboard.  You have to tell you this too much.  Someone painted that.  I can't do this.  And they got quotes that they made up.  They had fake press quotes.  And I'm like, no one ever said that about me.  So I'm literally, not only is the billboard too much.  Do you remember some of the quotes?  Do you remember?  Probably.  Best stand-up in New York City three years in a row.  That kind of shit.  Any other comedian that wants to be famous would have fucking took this and become the  biggest comedian of all time. 
[03:33:00]  Would have took all this crazy lies.  You took it for what it was.  Lies.  Yeah.  And I was like, dude, they should change the poster.  Who said this?  And the guy's like, it doesn't matter.  I'm like, it matters.  No, you can't do that.  So I'm starting to unravel.  Right.  And I'm hanging around the office at the club.  You know, like, I can't even, like, they put me up in this flat, which is, you know,  an apartment that they call a flat.  And I'm like, why does it have to be a different name?  And, you know, and, like, I'm in Melbourne, Australia.  I don't know what I'm doing.  So I find, like, I don't even want to look around the city.  I end up hanging around the office of the club going, so what do you do, you know, around  here?  And it was so sad. 
[03:33:30]  And somehow or another, I ended up in a fucking peep show place.  Like, the only place I ended up is some creepy porn thing.  Yeah.  And then, like, I can't even call people to freak out because it's, like, another day  here.  I don't even know.  Yeah, exactly.  That day already happened.  It's, like, tomorrow.  I don't even fucking understand.  And then here's what happens.  So I get to the club.  You do a week of previews for press.  All right?  Oh, shit.  So, right, just to get acclimated.  So here's the show.  This actually has an interesting ending to it.  So the show is, like, it's a comic.  This guy, his name is Greg. 
[03:34:00]  I barely remember.  He ties in later.  Greg Fleet is his name.  He's a comic.  He hosts.  Then he brings up this weird burlesque act.  Like, you know, like it was two women.  One of them had an accordion.  They had wigs.  Whatever.  Oh, fuck.  Then they bring up a guy who closes by escaping from a straitjacket, okay, on stilts.  All right?  That's his closer.  All right?  What the fuck kind of show is this?  Then there's an intermission.  And then me.  So, like, I'm watching this shit.  I'm watching them.  They're, like, excited, this guy.  I can't remember if it's stilts or a fucking unicycle. 
[03:34:30]  But something difficult.  He's pulling a straitjacket.  Yeah, it's very hard to do.  Yeah.  And they're like, ah!  And they're like, we're going to take a break for you guys to get dessert or whatever  the fuck it is.  So I'm backstage going, I can't do this.  I can't follow this.  I got no jacket.  I got no wig.  I got no jokes.  I'm fucked.  So this is going on.  And I go on.  And I struggle through it.  I do about 40 minutes.  And the guy comes up to me and goes, oh, you got to lose this joke.  You got to lose that joke.  So he's chipping away.  He's like, but you got plenty of stuff.  I'm like, yeah.  I guess I'm.  Yeah.  I'm just crumbling inside. 
[03:35:00]  And it's fucking awful.  This is on TV?  No, it's at a club that seats about 400 people.  Why are you going to lose jokes?  Huh?  Why are you going to lose jokes?  Because he didn't think they'd translate.  And one of them was about sticking my thumb in a girl's ass.  That translates everywhere in the world.  They do that down there.  Dan and that.  Right.  Dan and that.  Whatever.  I don't know what the fuck happened.  Stick a fucking thumb in your ass.  We're all.  We're building up.  We're building up to this first weekend.  Right.  This place is a huge club.  And they got a little room upstairs that seats about 80.  So the Saturday night comes.  They sell the place out.  It's the first legit night. 
[03:35:30]  After I struggle through previews, I sweat.  I lose jokes.  I got.  I'm breaking apart.  So they're standing ovation for the guy in the straight jacket.  They take the intermission.  The host brings me on.  I walk on stage.  The place is packed.  And an American goes, where'd you get that jacket?  And I don't know what happened, but I just felt everything leave me.  Oh, shit.  Like, I literally felt myself like my, my, I left my body.  I said, I'll see you later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be backstage.  But what was the jacket? 
[03:36:00]  Was it, was it fucked up?  It was kind of a fucked up jacket.  Right.  You know, it was a thrift store jacket, but I wore bell-bottom slacks once in Amsterdam  and, and Patrice and Keith Robinson took the wind out of my sails too.  Cause I was iffy on the fucking bell-bottoms.  Right.  And they were like, ugh, look at you.  Looked like I had a fucking, a black skirt on.  Cause I had a black shirt with the black bell-bottom slacks.  So it looked like a one piece leotard.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  But the fact that it was like an American, I don't know what happened, but all I remember  is for 40 minutes, all I heard were the embers of my cigarette burner. 
[03:36:30]  That, that, that, it was, it was slow motion.  You know, I'd left my body.  I was backstage watching me tank and just listening to this, the crackling of my cigarette to  complete silence.  And I walk off stage and literally sweat starts pouring out of me.  I, I was fucked.  I, I mean, it was just like the worst bomb I'd ever had in my life.  You fucking bombed.  There was a vacuum to thousands of miles from home, but like there was a suction to it.  Like no one said anything.  There was, it was just sort of like, they just witnessed something like it was like the  Hindenburg, but much less exciting. 
[03:37:00]  So, so I get off stage and the owner's like, wow, are you okay?  And I'm like, yeah.  Are you okay?  Oh, that's not good.  When the owner asks if you're okay.  And like you bomb.  I don't think that's ever happened, ever in comedy, the owner of a comedy.  You are right.  But, but the next day he takes me out and he says, look, I don't think this is working  out.  You know, it's my fault.  One day in.  One weekend.  Oh, one week.  Right.  Yeah.  So he says, my fault.  Look, I'll pay you for three weeks.  We'll send you home.  And there was part of me, like I felt horrible, but there was part of me was like, thank 
[03:37:30]  fucking Christ.  Yeah.  And, and then like someone, the waiter walks up, says, I saw you on that show, the Steve  Vizart show.  You're really funny.  Where are you playing?  I'm like, I'm not playing.  And then like, I get on the plane, I relapse.  I start drinking like a fucking fish.  I want to, I start hitting, knocking back vodkas.  I'm like, I'm done with comedy.  I'm not cut out for it.  Fuck this shit.  And it, that happened.  Like it must've been 92, 91.  So I go to Edinburgh two years ago.  This is the weirdest thing.  Cause now I'm sober.  Like what?  I'm going to be 11 years sober next month. 
[03:38:00]  Jesus Christ.  I go to Edinburgh and a guy walks in like, like in the, in the lounge where all the comics  are hanging out.  I was lost.  I go, I'm 25 years old.  So like this guy walks in in Edinburgh and I'm like, who the fuck?  I know that guy from somewhere.  And it's the guy who hosted the fucking show in Melbourne, Australia that I got sent home  on.  I hadn't seen him since like for what?  20 years.  Right.  And I'm like, you're that guy.  You remember me?  And he's like, yeah, I kind of remember you.  And then he sits down with me. 
[03:38:30]  I order a soda water.  He goes, that's what I should be ordering.  And I go, why?  He goes, well, I just got to rehab.  You know, you know, he's like, he's got heroin addiction.  He's like this infamous train wreck of a guy.  And like, and I, and I, I laid some fucking recovery wrap on him and it sort of like sunk  in.  He'd been trying to get sober for a long time.  Whatever the case is, you know, I kept him sober.  We went to meetings for a month in Edinburgh.  So there's this weird full circle thing that is 20 years later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And sort of, we connected.  I don't know if he stayed sober, but it was just sort of a nice, like something good came  out of the whole goddamn thing. 
[03:39:00]  Something good came out of it.  So that was the worst.  You had to find a plus side to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is a horrible bombing story.  Oh, to be sent home from a country.  Because it's not, it's not fucking Dallas.  It's too far from three hours.  It's a fucking a day to be like after something bad happens, you want the comfort of  your home.  You want to go into your cave and just like not talk to anybody.  A comic needs, after he bombs, another comic. 
[03:39:30]  You need another comic so bad because you need fucking dude and you need him to make  fun of you, to laugh at you, hear his shit, what happened to him.  The first thing you do when you bomb as a comic is get in touch with another fucking  comic.  You don't need.  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, uh, sit back and relax for a 30 hour flight, uh, before our  first stop.  Uh, have some vodka.  Yeah.  Drink a lot.  Yeah.  I want to say, hello to the comedian that I, uh, I saw. 
[03:40:00]  He's, uh, on the flight tonight.  We've got a celebrity.  He's giving up his job.  Yeah.  And there was no phones back then.  There was no cell phones back then.  Hopefully the plane won't crash and burn like that.  It was horrible.  When I saw him on TV.  It was horrible.  You couldn't even twit like I just bombed, which kind of let you feel a little better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had nothing back then.  Alone.  Nothing.  You were just loneliness.  Alone.  Horrible.  Horrible.  And you're eating weird cereal.  You know, you're sitting there and I couldn't call anybody.  I remember that the flight home was just off because I got home and then it doesn't stop 
[03:40:30]  because I was sent home from a country.  I was drinking again.  I didn't think I could be a comedian and I got home to the woman I was living with.  I'm like, I'm fucked.  And I was fucked for months.  She's fucking Russell Crowe.  But they don't understand it either.  Cause you're like, and they're like, it will get better.  Awful.  The woman who sent me home, it was a brother and sister who owned that club.  She's still in the business, you know?  And she remembers it.  Like, I've been honest about it.  But because I still do comedy, that it is sort of a shameful thing to fucking crap out 
[03:41:00]  that badly.  You know, but I literally had a nervous breakdown.  There was nothing I can do about it.  Fuck.  I mean, there was just nothing I could do about it.  I mean, it was like, I was gunning to be sent home.  Cause I had a real problem traveling abroad cause I already feel like I'm over it now.  Cause I'm going to England next week.  I'm going to Soho theater.  I'm doing two weeks, but it's taken a long time because I used to think like I felt so  alienated and weird and different and like they would never understand me.  And it took me a long time to realize that like, I feel that way just leaving my house. 
[03:41:30]  I mean, I don't, you know, like I go into Home Depot.  I have the same feelings and it's like got nothing to do with them.  And, uh, I can, but not having the time to like having 35, I did a show in Maine.  Oh, that was a big issue.  A coat, a coat, a headliner.  I only had 15 minutes.  I had to do, I had to do 45.  I had 15 minutes of mediocre material.  That's true.  That's true.  I had buck teeth.  I had buck teeth.  That was five of the, maybe eight of that moment.  I like buck teeth.  And I did jokes.  You take the gig.  Why take the gig? 
[03:42:00]  Because you think you're going to get up over the hump.  Because you improv the night before, fucking 30 minutes.  Right.  And you think you're the shit.  And then you get up there and you can't improv.  It doesn't work.  I actually started singing country songs.  Oh, boy.  I was like, country songs are crazy because it just, you know, my dog died.  It was, you can feel the, you can feel the sweat coming down your head.  You're getting shiny right now talking about it.  Oh, God.  You went to hack factor.  You have to throw yourself into those positions because if you're on the cusp of headlining, 
[03:42:30]  like you got 35, you got 40, you're going to have to take the chance.  You know, you're going to have to push it out there, but not in another country.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Somewhere close to home.  You know, we started the segments with you guys about cigarettes and Danny just popped up TMZ.  Or is it, yeah, TMZ.  Okay, Oksana versus Mel, the cigarette incident.  Is this new shit coming out?  What is the cigarette incident?  I don't know.  I just started reading it.  Well, he was a real, he was a chain smoker, wasn't he?  Mel Gibson was? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  So maybe he quit smoking and that's what this is all about.  Or maybe he went back to smoking.  It says here, it happened at a party last year.  Sources connected to the case say Oksana's 12-year-old son, Alexander, was playfully jumping up and down,  trying to knock a cigarette out of Mel's mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Oksana claims Mel exploded by grabbing the boy and throwing him violently onto a table.  Well, the little fucker.  Yeah, fuck him in his little dumb Russian accent.  I'll tell you though, he's probably shredded, the little kid. 
[03:43:30]  He's got fucking like 80 abs.  She's got him so over, she just did a number on this fucking guy.  Totally fucked him with these tapes, yeah.  But yeah, I mean, it was so intentional, it was clear.  I mean, whatever kind of guy he was, there was part of me that's like, well, she clearly didn't want to, she didn't want to make a legal case out of this.  No.  No, this was, because I don't even know if she can.  She just wanted to fuck him over.  I don't even know if she, like now, what kind of jury's going to be impartial to this shit?  Yeah, yeah.  So there was no, there was nothing more than like, you know, to blackmail this guy and publicly embarrass him and ruin his career for money is what she wanted to do. 
[03:44:00]  And I think she said no to money though.  Yeah, right.  Wasn't there something that came out, he was going to give her like 15 million or something and she said no to it?  I read that somewhere, right?  Because she wants more.  15 million?  She's going to get more.  15 million is not that much.  But I'm not saying he's a good guy, but I'm just saying the way that the shit works on the internet now,  that people have this ability to create a lynch mob mentality or this ridiculous, it's not justice what happens here. 
[03:44:30]  It's complete extortion and it's fucked up and everybody gets on board and there's no legality to it.  It's disgusting.  And with that, I think we should wrap up.  Oh, really?  That wasn't very upbeat.  Well, that's good.  We don't care.  It's a great ending.  It's a good ending.  I like downbeat endings to the show.  Have you been to my shows?  I caught it in Australia.  Oh, my God.  I wish I had a tape of that.  That's just scary.  You feel very alone.  The story itself gave me a little anxiety. 
[03:45:00]  I was just like, oh, that's just imagining being so far away from the comfort zone.  Yeah, but they're actually making you famous like other countries make you.  I didn't see that opportunity.  Anybody else would have took that as the best star.  Eddie Yift would have been, he would have came back a fucking superstar.  Other comics would have went there and literally stayed there because they're a star now.  No, I couldn't find it.  They were not my mommy.  No one was there to take care of me.  I felt alone and weird. 
[03:45:30]  And I came home to my, you know, to my middle status.  To my marginalized.  It's all different now, though.  I'm a superstar to say.  You sure are, Mark.  Thank you.  Where are you going to be, Mark?  Keep the dream alive.  I'm going to be at Comics tonight with doing a live What the Fuck podcast.  You can get those at WTFPod.com.  But tonight, two shows, 730, 930 at Comics.  Jeff Garland and Susie Essman on the first show.  That's great.  And Judah Friedlander and Louie Katz and a few other people on the second show.  It's going to be fun.  And then on Friday, I'm at Great Scott in Alston, Massachusetts. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, no shit.  Yeah, I'm doing that rock club.  That's great, man.  Yeah, I hope so.  It should be fun.  And then I'm doing the comedy studio, the Rick Jenkins plays on Saturday.  Short set.  That's great.  I don't want to step on my big set, but I'll do a short set at the comedy studio in Cambridge  on Saturday.  That's good, man.  Rock club.  It's fucking great you're doing that.  Yeah, I hope it works out.  And the podcast is great.  Have you listened to the podcast?  They're really good.  Yeah, it's a really good podcast.  Fan of the podcast.  We did Dane Cook a week or so ago.  It's so funny.  You guys are very, the Boston guys, you're very loyal to Dane. 
[03:46:30]  And I like that.  What do you mean by that?  I just mean he's a real friend to you.  Jesus.  No, I didn't know what he meant.  What do you mean by that?  Because a lot of people, was it like loyal, like you should be fucking, like saying some  fucking shit?  Yeah, saying bad stuff.  Or should, you know, loyal, like, I don't know.  No, no, you guys, you, like, you and Patrice.  The word loyal is weird.  No, you and Patrice.  There was something there, though.  Yeah, loyal is not.  Yeah, what are we getting there?  I don't know.  I would say, like, do you really like Dane?  You guys really like Dane.  No, I think you're taking it the wrong way, completely.  No, that's why I asked you.  No, I just find it interesting that in the face of all, you know, the shit that that guy gets, 
[03:47:00]  you guys who started with him are very sweet about him.  And I was a little bit of, I had a little edge when I was talking to him, because, you  know, he wanted to come on.  I didn't know how to really handle it.  I didn't want to be an asshole, and I was a little cranky.  But, you know, like, the guys who have known him since he started, you're all very nice  about him, even though everyone else hates his guy.  Yeah, but that's the thing about Mark, is you get, like, a bad rap for being this fucking  mag, but you're really one of the nicest guys.  Yeah.  You're a sweetheart.  All you have to do is say, Mark, you know, you'll come in, fucking, what the fuck, I'm fucking  back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Flipping out, and it's like, dude, what the fuck? 
[03:47:30]  Right, it's just a cry for help.  And then you go, dude, I just want ice cream.  Yeah, exactly.  I just want to eat ice cream.  I just want ice cream real bad.  If you know me, it's very easy to figure me out.  That's all we need is ice cream.  Oh, I've got it.  I've got ice cream all fucking day.  I went into a seizure.  Some woman on the train yesterday had an ice cream maker in a box, and it just drew me  into such a weird place.  I was literally like, do I got to get one of those?  I think I got to get one.  I think I need that.  It'd be like living with a drug dealer.  I mean, how the hell am I going to know what to put in the ice cream?  It was really like I had a meltdown in front of a box for an ice cream maker, to the point 
[03:48:00]  where I almost stood up and said, I'm not getting one.  The dialogue that went on in my head almost led me to out loud say, I'm not getting one  of those.  I had a legitimate thought of selling my apartment in New York to own a Pinkberry.  Really?  Yeah, I just want a Pinkberry.  I just want to be able to go back there and get as much mochi as I want.  The Pinkberries do well.  I want to know the frozen mochi.  Oh, with the skin?  Pop those in the freezer?  You can get those at Trader Joe. 
[03:48:30]  That shit is fucking good.  But at Pinkberry, they have mochi balls.  That's what I'm talking about.  You get mochi balls and throw them out of the freezer.  Part of that for you.  I think that's what the...  Isn't that what we saw on that medical website earlier?  The guy had mochi balls.  It does look like it.  Have you ever had a mochi ball?  Mochi balls rule.  Yeah.  They do.  Fuck, I'm going to go get one now.  Mochi balls.  I've never had mochi balls.  Oh, it's the best.  I wanted to ask Mark if he could go through one day without a situation or a turmoil.  Yeah, I think I'm trying.  It's just like everything sets you off. 
[03:49:00]  Well, it's a lot going on in my head.  Right?  A lot going on.  A lot of it I don't talk about.  But the heat helps.  I like the heat.  What did you say?  A lot of it you don't talk about?  That's scary.  What the fuck are you talking about?  What do you mean?  It's in an internal well.  It is.  Because I talked to Patrice for two hours, made me believe that I spend too much time  on my head and not enough time on my balls.  Patrice made this argument.  That sounds like Patrice.  You're too logical.  He's fucking hypnotic.  He really is. 
[03:49:30]  He's hypnotic.  I will follow him like the Pied Piper.  Very logical.  For two fucking hours for the podcast.  I think we're going to have to do two episodes.  One is about women and one is about race.  Might as well.  But it kind of fucked with my head because then I started like last night, the ice cream  boxing, the ice cream maker thing.  I started really thinking about how much I think about shit and what I went through.  What I mean by unsaid is that literally I'm sitting on a train going through all these  different options.  I start thinking along like, do people put eggs in ice cream?  I read in Hagen-Dazs ice cream that there's eggs in it.  Do I put eggs in my ice cream? 
[03:50:00]  I don't like Hagen-Dazs.  It fucks with my stomach.  And what if I don't make ice cream as good as Hagen-Dazs?  Would I be able to make?  This is all racing through your fucking head.  Within two minutes.  Wow.  That's unbelievable.  That's fucked up.  And drinking didn't help.  Drinking just made it angry.  It slowed it down.  And it'd be like, you're a fucking idiot for liking ice cream as much as you do, you  stupid fuck.  I want to see the wake of therapists behind Marc Maron.  The wake.  Just laid out.  A rooster tail.  The cover of your next CD is just therapists dead behind you. 
[03:50:30]  I've never felt better in my life than right now.  You fucking knew.  You look good.  You look good, Marc.  I feel I'm grounded.  I'm not weird or sad.  Do you feel any sadness?  When you came back to New York, you were fucked.  I remember coming to the cellar, and the lights in the cellar are so dim anyways, I saw him  at the back table with his head down and his hair, and half his face was shadowed.  It was just a sad fucking thing.  I had a vacuum.  I inherited that from my father.  I can create a sad vacuum in a room.  I saw a scene with him in comics. 
[03:51:00]  It's been a few years.  You're on our show, so I guess we didn't help out, but the crowd was a little light, unfortunately,  because Marc really is a funny comic, and he was having a dialogue with himself that was  really fascinating.  It was during the divorce, though.  Yeah.  That's when you saw me.  But then you look at the sign.  I think you said it on stage in front of everybody.  You're like, of course no one's here.  They spell comic, C-O-M-I-X.  Who spells it that way?  How the fuck are they supposed to find me?  And he's just having this dialogue that I guess was supposed to just be in his head, 
[03:51:30]  but is in front of everybody.  Yeah, that's what happens.  It was in front of everybody.  Everyone's like, wow, this is fucking awesome.  Yeah, there was a period there where people would leave saying, that guy's hilarious,  or they'd leave saying, I hope he's okay, that guy.  It's a good experience.  I think you were even talking to another version of yourself.  I don't know.  I did that last night, yeah.  There was something going on.  He was in a fucking another dimension.  A parallel universe.  I'm working on a character called Old Mark, which was me two years ago,  which gives me license to say really shitty, sad things. 
[03:52:00]  I was with a bunch of people.  I'm like, you know what?  We won't say hi after this show.  Oh, is that bad?  Let's go get a bite to eat.  Oh, no.  We're drained enough.  Maybe you don't even know I was there, because I was like,  you know what?  Usually I like to say hi to you guys.  But that's all we leave.  Why don't we go get a bite to eat?  Everything's okay now, folks.  So come on down.  It's safe to come see me.  Well, you asked, and there is a difference is what I'm getting at.  There's absolutely a difference, I see.  See, you know, like right now, I don't have to eat the bag of nuts that came with the oatmeal  because I decided not to put them on the oatmeal and go with the fruit,  but they're still sitting here, so I'm going to fucking shove them into my mouth. 
[03:52:30]  But did you have a whole conflict with the whole?  I just explained it to you.  Yeah, yeah.  But that was it?  That's not that bad.  No, it's not that bad.  All right.  That's an easy one to get through.  We'll just end on him eating nuts.  Just end the show.  Wait.  But you know what?  This is what I want to try.  What's going on in your head now that you're eating the nuts?  You're so fucking good, but I'm going to feel so fucking fat in a minute.  Is that really what you're thinking?  How are nuts going to make you fat?  Now keep going.  What do you mean?  The healthy thing is that you...  That's such a...  Okay, what?  Peanut butter is healthy? 
[03:53:00]  It's still fucking fat.  No, I didn't say peanut butter.  I said nuts.  Oh, is there a difference?  I mean, like...  Yeah, there's fucking nuts.  They call it a healthy fat.  But I guess it doesn't...  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  No one looks at healthy fat and say, you know what?  You're a fat fuck, but you look good.  You look healthy.  It's a healthy fat.  What are you thinking now?  I'm thinking I don't need to eat these all because I feel shitty about what I ate last  night.  I'm such a fucking girl.  I just thought that.  Why am I even thinking about that?  If I were a real man, would I be sitting here worrying about what I ate last night and  worrying about eating half a bag of fucking nuts?  Keep going.  What's in your head?  After I just ate a goddamn bag of vitamins? 
[03:53:30]  What the fuck is wrong with me?  Someone just...  I should be in prison.  This is freeing, isn't it?  Uh-huh.  Anything that pops in your head, just say it right now.  It's embarrassing, and then I'm...  I'm gay!  I'm gay!  Me too!  You are gay!  Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.  It's Bobby.  Sorry.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Shit.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  You guys gave us great radio today, and I appreciate it.  Bobby's going to be at the Funny Bone starting tonight, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,  Sunday.  Are you going to take a breath in the middle of my plug?  I actually had to.  It's Columbus, right?  Columbus Funny Bone.com. 
[03:54:00]  All right.  We're going to leave you guys with something Troy came up with.  No Gibson remix.  It's cool.  That's good, yeah.  It's, uh, Mel Gibson and Lamb of God together.  Oh, that's the other one.  Fuck.  Yes.  You want to play that one?  That one was good.  I already promoted this one.  Help!  Help!  Oh!  Break in the ass!  Listen to what you do to me!
