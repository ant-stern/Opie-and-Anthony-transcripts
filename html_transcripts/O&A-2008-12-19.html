<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with sarcastic mockery of local news coverage of a predicted snowstorm, highlighting the perceived sensationalism and inconsistencies in reporting.  The hosts ridiculed the over-the-top visuals and interviews with people panic-buying at Home Depot, specifically focusing on the irrational stockpiling of milk and eggs.  Jim Norton promoted his upcoming stand-up show at the Borgata. The conversation then veered into a discussion of ice melt composition, Kim Kardashian's sex tape, and a rant about bad drivers, including the use of racial slurs.  Movie reviews followed, with the hosts panning several films, including *Yes Man*. Norton then pitched an idea for a Pixar-style animated movie about anthropomorphic guns, complete with comedic violence and Southern accents. The snowstorm (or lack thereof) was revisited before a joke about Stunt Brain illegally distributing *The Wrestler*.

The show continued with a discussion of *The Wrestler*, praising Mickey Rourke's comeback and Marissa Tomei's nudity.  *7 Pounds* was discussed based on a caller's vague description, and another caller praised *The Dark Knight*'s Joker portrayal. *Terminator Salvation* and Christian Bale's performance were analyzed, drawing comparisons to his Batman voice.  A tangent on *Back to the Future* and time travel paradoxes led to a humorous concept for a Biff Tannen museum.  Mindy McCready's suicide attempt and recovery were mentioned, transitioning into discussions of country music, Will Smith films, and Peyton Manning.  The hosts then explored a list of almost-used sports team names, many of which were offensive.  Tom Cruise's David Letterman appearance and his top ten list (joking about internet rumors) were discussed.  The segment concluded with "F.U. line" calls and a detailed recounting of the North Hollywood shootout, drawing from a History Channel documentary and YouTube videos. A caller's story about a high school basketball team nicknamed "the London Ugly Douches" segued into impressions of John Merrick, the Elephant Man.

A segment focused on a bank robbery where two heavily armed men stole only $30. Listeners contributed details from a History Channel documentary, including the robbers' homemade body armor and the police's initial failure to arrest them due to insufficient charges.  The subsequent lawsuit against the city was mentioned.  This transitioned to a discussion of a pilot who, unable to land in foggy Paris, turned his plane around, leading to anecdotes about sleeping pilots and listener accounts of frightening flight experiences, including a near-hydraulic failure.  The hosts discussed pilot reliability and the calming effects of minimal pilot announcements. The segment included a discussion of the top Google searches of 2008, mentioning explicit content like "One Guy, One Cup" and "Lemon Party."  The final portion featured an extended "Kiss Lily" bit, with Agatha brought into the studio. The interaction with Lily became flirty and suggestive, including a demonstration of "cupping" genitals over leggings.  The segment continued with further discussion of Agatha and her relationship with a caller.  Opie, Anthony, Lily, Agatha, and possibly Sam (a producer/engineer) were in the studio.

The "Kiss Lily" bit continued, featuring Lily, Agatha, and Patty. A significant argument erupted between studio guest E-Rock and Eric, with accusations, insults ("faggot," "homo"), and E-Rock's temporary departure. E-Rock's relationship with Agatha and Patty's physical condition (scoliosis, arthritis, excessive sweating) were discussed extensively, culminating in a challenge for another guest, Iraq, to smell Patty's armpit.  The focus remained on convincing Patty and Lily to kiss, highlighting their discomfort and concerns.  Discussions about the guests' dating lives and sexual experiences, including anal beads and a monetary challenge involving their insertion into Patty's anus, ensued. The segment ended with a reluctant attempted kiss between Lily and Patty.  The segment was filled with crude humor, sexual innuendo, and offensive language.

The final segment featured Matt, a socially awkward guest, who became the target of sexually explicit jokes about his lack of dating experience and virginity.  Lily, described as honest and having called Matt a "cuddly teddy bear," was also present. Jokes about Matt's weight and appearance were prevalent.  The conversation shifted to Opie's exaggerated story about helping a blind man cross the street, which involved darkly comedic scenarios of further "helping" the man.  Personal anecdotes followed, including a radio internship, personal hygiene, and a falling out between Dan and Sam, with allegations of Sam performing oral sex on another man.  The upcoming "Special Delivery" show with Sam and Dave from Ron and Fez was mentioned, along with Norton's Borgata show.  The segment concluded with crude jokes and promotional announcements for Direct TV and Norton's show.  Throughout the broadcast, numerous interjections, side conversations, and humorous moments occurred.  Multiple callers participated, and at least three people (Opie, Anthony, and possibly Sam) were in the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Wow, it's just crazy outside. Look at all that snow. Wow!  Woo! Don't even know how I made it in today.  Yeah, crazy.  Oh, I know I live only a few blocks from the radio station, but woof!  Wow! I'd get a few snow dogs. 
[00:00:30]  Dumb news, can't get anything right.  They got me all excited, too.  I jump out of bed, I'm like, ooh, snow!  Who doesn't like snow?  Ran to my window.  Not even a flake.  Dude, they're doing that whole scare the crap out of everybody.  Look at this, look at the news.  The people are being interviewed down by the sand,  little sand hills that they load up the trucks with,  and spread the sand. 
[00:01:00]  I was looking at the weather map.  I don't know, meteorologists.  But this is another typical example of,  it's going to be rain.  You think it's going to be rain?  Could be a little bit of ice at first.  Maybe some snow at first, even.  Yeah.  Because it's cold out.  But they show that snow, ice, slushy, rain line.  And it's right in the middle of where we are.  And you know they push it down to make it look worse than it is. 
[00:01:30]  Sure.  And they go, major snow event north and west of the area.  So they mean, like, northern west New Jersey and upstate New York.  Look at upstate, 7 to 12 inches.  Look where that is.  That's in, like, Canada.  Might as well be.  It doesn't, it's not going to develop into anything.  It's going to be rainy. 
[00:02:00]  It's going to be a washout.  But they love just scaring everybody.  The point I'm trying to make, though,  it was supposed to be snowing already.  And now, oh, uh, uh, well, it's going to start around 11.  It's delayed.  Now it's delayed.  They knew it was going to be delayed the whole time.  But it makes a better story that it's going to snow  as people try to get into work.  Yes, the commute.  Oh, the commute could, uh, oh, possible.  They're a bunch of liars.  And then they'll be like, oh, the commute home.  That's going to be the one.  Uh-oh. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  They're just liars.  They don't know how to tell the truth on the news  because it doesn't make for a good story.  Yeah.  You can't just tell the truth.  You can't be the guy that goes on and goes, well, you know what?  I know everyone else is getting you excited about snow.  But this is, uh, if it does happen,  it's going to be after your commute.  You have plenty of time to figure out if you want to go to work.  It'll be a changeover.  Back to you, Chip.  For rain.  Yeah.  It's going to be this big snowstorm.  Because they're talking with people.  It's like, I heard this morning on winds.  And I'm here in the Bronx talking with a livery cab driver 
[00:03:00]  who says he's ready for the snow.  Is he?  Are you?  Is he really?  Because, uh, I look outside.  Ah, nothing.  Wow.  Every channel has some, wow, there is this pile of salt and sand over there.  There's, there's a guy talking about school closings over there.  There's a, there's some broad airport next to a plow.  They're all getting ready.  I'm sure. 
[00:03:30]  Nothing.  I'm sure it's going to snow for a while, but, uh, it's not snowing now.  No.  Like they said it would.  And, uh, wow.  I think it was Sam.  He, he did a fine little job, uh, this morning.  One, two, three, four, five different TV stations.  All quick clips, so don't worry.  Yeah.  They're all at the Home Depot.  Oh, God.  Why?  For what?  All five TV stations thought it was a good idea to go to the Home Depot. 
[00:04:00]  Do they all have some kind of manual?  Oh, it's going to snow.  Send our reporters to the Home Depot.  That's the place to be.  Tell them what they could buy to get through this snow.  Oh, in the year 2008.  I haven't figured this one out yet.  No, we haven't figured this one out yet.  Now they're showing footage of a car skidding around from where?  Where is that?  Um, probably like years ago.  It wasn't here.  It wasn't now.  They have to show old footage of some snow on the road.  Well, they're so disappointed. 
[00:04:30]  I was watching one news channel, and it looked like a live shot.  It was a live shot, and it was snowing.  I'm like, huh.  It was Chicago.  Because, see, they couldn't get there.  Yeah.  They're live snow yet here in New York to freak everyone out.  So they're like, well, it doesn't matter.  It's not snowing in New York yet.  We'll just show it's snowing somewhere else.  Yeah.  And maybe they'll get fooled a little bit.  There's one of the news reporters at LaGuardia Airport.  Um, and people seem to be, um, online. 
[00:05:00]  Well, let's go to the, uh, let's go to the, uh, look at the on-time.  See, uh, here's something to the news.  If you want to make a good story and, uh, and you, and you show the, the, uh, departures  Yeah.  At the airport.  You might not want to show a shot of every plane on time.  On time.  You dopes.  Just, uh, the news disgusts me. 
[00:05:30]  Because it was, it was hammered in a montage of, oh my God, oh my God.  And they showed the screen and it's all flights on time.  It was on time.  You dummies.  It's chilly out.  That's what I would say.  Hey, it's chilly out.  Yeah.  Well, let's, uh, let's see what's going on.  Channel 11, they now call themselves Picks.  I don't know why.  Uh, they sent one of their dopes to the Home Depot.  The roads may be clear now, but come morning, winter will be. 
[00:06:00]  In full force.  So you knew that the storm was coming.  Did you guys kind of get into snow prep mode too?  Oh, absolutely.  Employees at this Home Depot in Rockland County can't seem to stock the shelves quick enough.  You have to make sure that you have some kind of chemical, either rock salt or, um, calcium chloride to put down on your sidewalks or your driveway so that it's not slippery.  You need to have some kind of washer fluid in your car.  Some kind of brush to clear off the car in the first place.  We spotted Marty Flaxman stocking up. 
[00:06:30]  I have my ice melts and I have two shovels, one for me and hopefully for my daughter who's going to help.  I would, I would, I would ban those ice melts if I was like some kind of politician.  I imagine it's not good for the environment.  Not that I'm a salt everywhere.  Not that I'm a big environmentalist, but you know, let's go old school.  We didn't have this crap when we were growing up.  You just had to take that shovel until you got down to the sidewalk.  And then be careful when you're walking out because there was a layer of ice that was still there. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  It slipped and fall on your ass walking down your stairs.  I can't imagine that the drinking water is healthy after everyone is just spraying their ice melt around.  And they have some kind of weird like law in New York where you have to like, if you own something, like you own a, like a store, you have to keep your sidewalk completely, you know, clear.  Yeah.  So you see all these people with their ice melt, just throwing it down, heaving it out there.  And then on a nice warm day, you see that, that ice melt water just going into the sewers and you're like, uh, where's that going? 
[00:07:30]  I think I can do the math here.  Great.  Yeah.  Where's that going?  Just so we don't have a little slippy slip.  Yeah.  We're going to have a little something, something happening inside our bodies in a few years.  So then you got a channel nine going to the same place, Home Depot.  Winter doesn't officially start until Sunday, but folks at this Jersey.  City, Home Depot or stocking up.  Why do they have to say that?  I think every person alive would acknowledge that it's already winter.  It doesn't matter what the calendar says and does. 
[00:08:00]  And that, you know, we do occasionally get winter weather before.  Occasionally.  Technically winter starts.  We've had a lot of winter weather already.  It's being a little sarcastic.  They're open.  So this dumb dope will, you know, even though.  Winter doesn't officially start until Sunday, but folks at this Jersey City, Home Depot or stocking up.  Coming up on snow shovels and salt, the store also has snowblowers and plenty of ice scrapers and stock.  Staples like milk, eggs, and bread were at the top of shopping lists at this acne grocery store in Jersey City. 
[00:08:30]  Shoppers here are not quite sure what to expect, but want to be ready just in case.  I'm going to make sure I have enough.  Ready for what?  Cloverfield?  What are we getting ready for?  A major disaster.  You know, I don't do a lot of shopping.  You know, you live in New York.  You don't do a lot of shopping.  It's a lot of takeout, right?  I am positive that if there is some kind of blizzard, and especially in the year 2008. 
[00:09:00]  I'll say that again.  I know.  How long would you be, you know, stuck at home?  Stranded in your house?  In New York City, by the way.  This isn't in the middle of the plains.  Two days, maybe?  Two days?  Well, I'm trying to be nice.  Not even a day.  Not even a day.  I would probably go with not even a day, but just to be nice, two days.  Now, I know that I have stuff in my cupboards that I can survive for two days.  Why do these dopes run out, get their milk, their eggs? 
[00:09:30]  Milk and eggs.  Don't you got stuff in your house just in case?  I got to make breakfast.  The weather's crazy.  Why are people rushing out every time, like, there's a hint that there might be a major snowstorm?  I don't get it.  Top of the list.  Milk, bread, and eggs.  It's a French toast factory.  I'll go without milk for a day or two.  Who cares?  I'm sure my bones and teeth will be strong. 
[00:10:00]  It's just weird.  The roads are never to the point where they're impassable for any length of time.  And if you own an SUV, they're just not impassable.  Right.  Sorry.  I'll plow right through anything.  Yeah.  That's good one to be ready just in case.  I'm going to make sure I have enough just in case I get snowed in.  Me and my family can be able to be all right and we can eat. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  Tomorrow, if it's real bad, I'm staying in.  I'm planning on staying in.  Outside.  She's going to sleep.  She thinks she's going to be snowed in.  Yeah.  When was the last time people were snowed in?  Stunk brain.  Look that up.  The Donner Party.  They ate each other.  There you go.  This is crazy.  I remember years ago.  I do.  When people complained that streets didn't get plowed or certain neighborhoods got plowed  before other neighborhoods or whatever.  We know which neighborhoods get plowed before.  Exactly.  Before everyone else.  They had to get out and go to work. 
[00:11:00]  Jesus.  But there are certain neighborhoods that didn't get plowed.  There was a bunch of people that were reprimanded about it and replaced.  And now, before it snows, they lay salt down.  So the snow barely sticks to the streets.  And then they're out there plowing as it's snowing.  They got the city guys with the garbage trucks and the plows and the private contractors doing  the parking lots and everything.  You do not all of a sudden walk out and go,  Oh my God, there's six feet of snow against my door. 
[00:11:30]  It looks like the Shining.  It's like the Overlook Hotel with the snow up to the second, third floor.  Stop it.  We had one storm.  It was like the winter of 95, 96, where they actually had to close the city for two days.  It was that 36 inches of snow.  And that was it.  And even then, you could get around.  And that was two days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was two days.  And that was a massive storm for the city.  You couldn't get milk, though. 
[00:12:00]  I was on some milk so bad.  I'm like, I want milk.  What about eggs, Jim?  I had no eggs.  I had one egg.  Did you save it just in case?  Well, I put all the ones I had in one basket.  And you know how that goes.  I slipped because I had no rock salt.  Did you cry when something happened with your milk?  Because there's no use.  Oh, it's funny you say that.  Because I actually, I grabbed the carton and I threw it at someone's face.  It spilled all over the wall.  And when the person starts crying, you just go, hey. 
[00:12:30]  Exactly.  You know the saying.  Shut up.  Then you grab, like, Connie Corleone and you yell, clean it up.  Oh, clean it up.  Be a milk drinker like your father.  Anyone that's found shopping for, like, eggs and milk today, we should just take them away  to live somewhere else, if you know what I mean.  Next storm, we got to do a...  Just take them away.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  Yeah.  Sam should be doing what's the haps. 
[00:13:00]  Sam should go out to some of the stores and do a...  That's a good idea.  What's the haps as far as the weather goes and what they're doing to prepare for the big  storm?  I don't even know.  Like I said, I don't even know, but I'm sure I have a couple cans of soup.  Maybe some kind of, like, rice.  You got any pasta and jarred sauce?  I'll deal with a little water if I have to.  Whatever.  I'm going to survive.  They won't find a skeleton in your chair.  That's pretty much it.  Hell no.  People think that they're going to be skeletons in their chair. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  How bad do you need eggs?  I need my eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  How bad do you need dairy?  I want to go into these people's houses, open their fridge, and just start throwing their  eggs at them.  There's none left.  I need my milk and eggs.  Why?  Why do you need this?  It's always stupid old people that remember when, like, I don't know, it snowed like 10  feet.  Yeah.  No plows.  You got to dig out yourself. 
[00:14:00]  How much does your life suck that you're running off to a supermarket for eggs and milk?  And I won't shovel anything.  Of course not.  Unless, you know, if there's a couple of feet out there, the neighborhood kids come around  with the shovels.  I think you throw them some bucks and they'll do that.  But for the most part, what the hell's in the way?  It's going to be gone in, like, no time when it rains.  So who's shoveling?  There's people at the second that one snowflake falls around there. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  They just love it.  They have the shovel near the door.  Yeah.  Honey, going out.  Another inch fell.  I'm shoveling.  I'm going to, yeah.  Okay, I'll make the eggs.  You want a tall glass of milk before you go out?  I'll make some bread with you.  I'm going to wipe off the stoop again.  It's the 10th time I've wiped it off.  Especially since this is New York.  It's like, it's not Buffalo.  You can go, you can, every bodega has every, you can go by Cap'n Crunch at milk at four  in the morning.  You're never going to eat something here. 
[00:15:00]  Everything, Jimmy.  Right.  Nothing closes.  Here's the difference.  I lived in Buffalo.  It was a horror show for three years.  It was my prison sentence.  And those people just, there's blizzards and they're just driving to the mall to go shopping  and nothing bothers those people because they understand what it's all about.  They understand that, you know, it's going to be taken care of.  I saw some amazing snowfalls up there in Buffalo and I don't remember the city ever being shut  down.  I don't remember it being a disaster whatsoever. 
[00:15:30]  I remember people just driving like it was a sunny day.  Yeah.  They're just used to it.  They're used to it.  Right.  It gets even worse than what we have going on here in New York.  Every once in a while, it'll snow like a half a millimeter in Dallas and it'll shut  the city down.  You've seen that footage, right?  It snowed in Vegas.  Vegas, sure.  Same thing.  Yesterday, I think it snowed in Vegas and they showed the video.  They're freaking out like, oh my God.  You ever been to Vegas? 
[00:16:00]  I don't think you're getting snowed in anywhere.  I never saw the outside of Vegas to tell you the truth.  I never left like a building.  Too good.  All right.  We got more news footage.  We got three more stations.  Lucky us.  Going to the Home Depot.  All right.  To talk to dummies.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I think it's a big day for Jim Norton, right, Jimmy? 
[00:16:30]  You got a little, you got something going on sale today.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks, man.  10 o'clock this morning.  My third and final show at the Borgata.  Sunday, January 18th.  Show number one is almost sold.  Two is totally sold.  And three goes on sale this morning at 10 a.m. at the Borgata.com.  Nice.  Very nice.  877-212-ON-A.  Talking about the snow storm.  I still don't see a flake.  They pretty much told us we would have snow by now. 
[00:17:00]  I'm starting to look at some maps.  And now they're starting to push the snow thing a little north of where it's really important.  No offense to the people that are north of here.  But the news really wants a major storm to hit Manhattan, Long Island, Jersey, maybe a little of Westchester County.  And it's just not going to happen to the extent they want and need.  Of course not. 
[00:17:30]  Why would it?  Yeah.  So they just try to scare you, make you buy your bread and your eggs.  Go ahead.  Yeah, look.  It's not even.  It's all that green is rain.  A rain.  And that's what's heading our way.  Rain.  They can't tell us that, though, because it makes for better TV.  No.  People aren't going to be like, oh, my God, it's going to rain.  Yeah, we were supposed to wake up to just a nasty snowstorm.  And we woke up already.  Other people are waking up, and they're not seeing their nasty snowstorm. 
[00:18:00]  And then an hour from now, same thing.  Two hours from now, same thing.  But the news, they're all going to Home Depot.  I guess that's the place to be before the big snowstorm.  I hate that I live in the same world as dummies like this.  I have nothing to talk to you about if this is what you do.  What am I going to talk to you about?  You're running to get a snow shovel? 
[00:18:30]  I think I bought one snow shovel in ten years.  You just find other stuff to clear off your cars and sidewalks, you know?  You don't have to run to Home Depot every time it snows for another snow shovel.  You hope that at least one person, when they're like, what are you buying for the storm?  And they say five hammers and a pound of tampons.  Yeah.  They don't count the boxes.  They weigh the tampons in exactly a pound.  If you're running out to get eggs and milk, I have nothing to say to you.  Duct tape, zip strips, and a chisel. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Just getting ready for the snowstorm.  Yeah.  What are you buying?  Tape, rope, and condoms.  Oh, boy.  And a gun.  I would love for the news to be caught like that.  Yeah.  Talking to someone live, and that's what they say.  Well, just getting ready for the snowstorm.  Buying tampons here in the Bronx.  I'm John Montone.  Spectro's got a new bid for us because we're a national show.  We're going to do the school closings for the entire country coming up at 8 o'clock. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  We'll start with Maine, and we'll work our way across the country.  Thank you, Spectro.  How great would that be?  Got to keep it national.  Yeah.  You know how they're trying to keep it local?  Like, we try to keep it national.  Yeah, we do try to keep it national.  So, we got News 12 at Home Depot.  They're all going to Home Depot.  Outside, mountains of sand and salt sit patiently, waiting for the season's first big snowball. 
[00:20:00]  But shoppers at Home Depot and Colmack have their...  What do you think these dummies are buying?  This is the game to play.  Obviously, what?  Some kind of melting...  Ice melt.  Ice melt.  Shovels.  I know what they're buying.  And a two-by-four.  They're buying hats made out of the same lead material you wear when you get an x-ray.  Big, heavy hats.  Those are heavy.  Lead hats.  If it's snowing, why do you need those lead hats? 
[00:20:30]  I don't know.  It's like a 35-pound hat and your chin strap and your head just droops.  You don't want your hair getting all wet because it's going to be that wet snow.  You've got to keep your head covered.  Who would buy that?  I don't know.  Who knows?  Bullets may fall.  Who would make that?  I don't know.  The lead hat company.  The lead hat company.  From Walla Walla, Washington.  It's the lead hat company.  And Colmack have their driveways to tackle.  Well, I know I need this because we're supposed to snow, right?  We have pretty much everything available from shovels to ice melts to things even for your car as far as windshield washer fluid. 
[00:21:00]  Stunt brain, I need to know what's in the ice melt.  I'm a little paranoid of the ice melt.  The ice melt.  Probably matches.  Right.  It's, yeah, some type of sodium.  Yeah.  Or calcium.  You know what?  Sodium chloride or calcium chloride.  I'm sure that's in there, but I guarantee there's some other, like, some really bad chemicals that they're trying to hide in there. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, stunty?  Yeah.  Here we go.  An ice melt.  Sodium chloride, which is rock salt.  Mm-hmm.  Calcium chloride, the liquid converted into pellets by removing the water.  Oh.  Magnesium chloride.  That doesn't sound good.  Oh, that's not a good one.  Yeah.  Potassium chloride and urea.  Chemicals found in fertilizer.  Why don't they just get it?  You know what you find in urea?  Oh, yes.  Sometimes a small jar that's broken. 
[00:22:00]  Is that it, Stunt?  That seems to be the thing.  Potassium chloride is good and all, but I like just putting pure potassium out on my sidewalk.  It's a chemical joke, everybody.  Come on.  6.30 in the morning, it's a chemical joke.  Of course, it would burst into flames.  Ha, ha, that potassium and water.  Oh, it's a scream.  That's why I'm not laughing.  Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-waap.  I'm not laughing. 
[00:22:30]  Because I hated chemistry in school.  I hated it.  I wonder what people would do if you poured gas all over your driveway and lit it on fire.  Litted.  And that was how you melted snow.  Stood back with your hands on your hips as the neighbors are just horrified.  Yeah, like a perfect line of the sidewalk in your driveway.  Oh, that would cool.  Free catches on fire.  They were saying the MTA out on Long Island, the train guys, actually have a team of flamethrowers.  So they actually de-ice the tracks with flamethrowers.  See, that I would look forward to snow.  That would be a great gig.  That would be an awesome job.  Who's on flamethrower detail? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, my God.  That I want flamethrower details.  He's me.  That guy's a flashback while they're going through flushing.  He starts unloading on people, thinking maybe they're in caves.  All right, here we go.  And then the next station, this would be NBC.  They went to Home Depot.  Ah, did they go to Home Depot.  And I wonder what they're selling at Home Depot.  At Home Depot under the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, a lot of people are not waiting 
[00:23:30]  for those first flakes to fall before picking up what they need.  You know, as a homeowner, you've got to have your salt.  You've got to get your shovel.  So you have to get the shovel.  You've got to keep the place clean.  Already.  I mean, we have already sold at least six to seven skids of salt already.  Already going already.  And what about shovels?  Shovels are moving like hotcakes.  What do you think?  What about shovels?  What do you think is happening with the shovels?  People are shoveling them.  They're outselling the snow cone makers three to one. 
[00:24:00]  Idiots.  It is amazing how lazy the media has gotten.  It's like years ago with Cronkite and the Real Reporters.  Did they really have every story have to tie in with a person on the street commenting idiotically?  I mean, it just seems like every story just needs some dumbbell go, yeah, rock salt.  We talked with people on the street.  It's like no one wants, no one values their opinion.  No one.  No one cares.  Look, there's a guy with a little wool hat that must run one of the salt trucks. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And look, and there's the live shot in Chicago because we don't have our live snow yet.  That is live in Chicago.  The local news here.  Because they're hoping that you just turn on the TV, you don't notice it says live Chicago,  and you're like, oh, my God, see, this is the snow they promised us.  Then you got the dummy at the airport.  Smug guys at the airport where people are.  Just in line.  Well, yeah, there's going to be some delays.  It happens every time there's snow happening in the country.  Holiday travelers. 
[00:25:00]  And where is that?  That story starts next week.  You'll have that.  Where is that?  Look at this.  They're showing a car skidding out, that same car.  It has to be footage from.  Two years ago, I would guess.  I think that was an Edsel.  Yeah.  And finally, we got Fox.  Where are they?  Well, do you want to guess?  Lowe's.  At the Home Depot.  Ah, okay.  They're at the Home Depot. 
[00:25:30]  And they can't think out of the box.  That's what amazes me, too.  They all just follow suit.  They're terrible.  They're terrible.  You can't figure out another way to, like, you know, go with this?  Ugh.  At the Home Depot on West 23rd Street, shovels and rock salt were moving fast.  They've been asking for a lot of shovels and salt.  Yeah.  And I guess that's a good thing to be prepared.  Hey, Bob, is this a good one for me to get or what?  Yes, this shovel saves you from bending.  The arch on it saves you from bending over. 
[00:26:00]  As you can see from this here shovel, this is a straight push or pick up.  Savvy New Yorkers.  There should just be a gunshot.  In the middle of that talking, him stop talking.  Yeah.  And hearing that sack of potatoes fall on the floor.  Yeah.  Someone should just be like, is he saying this?  He's talking about the snow shovel?  Yeah.  And how the bent handle helps him.  Bam!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ugh.  The government should make a new law that you can't make the snow shovel, shovel, easier. 
[00:26:30]  No?  No.  That little bent handle?  No.  That's like, look, I don't have to bend over as far.  Same shovel for everyone.  Invent other crap.  We don't need to make snow shoveling easier.  We really don't.  I never liked that bent handle one.  Leverage is in the wrong spot.  It's really strange to use.  Just get a young buck to shovel your driveway. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Here you go, young fella.  Right.  I like seeing an industrious little child out there shoveling for a few shekels.  Yeah.  Sure pick up.  You know what would be great if the news for once thought outside the box?  And if one station just had a guy outside the bowling alley saying that it's not open  yet, but we're waiting for it to open so we can talk to bowlers, and just how stupid  that would be.  How would you not watch that news?  That would be great.  You could, in a backwards way, give the news out, and people would enjoy that. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, there's still no snow, and we're waiting for bowlers to show up.  It would be great.  Bowlers.  You are some awful questions to ask people.  That would be great.  Where they're walking out of the store.  Did you buy any Tonka trucks?  What?  What?  No.  Here's the rest of this last clip.  This is a straight push or pick up.  Yeah.  Savvy New Yorkers know personal prep matters, too, like the right clothes and the right timing. 
[00:28:00]  Ugg boots, gloves, coat, everything.  I don't want to be cold at all.  I take the express bus, and sometimes they're not on time, and they're normally late when the  weather's bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That takes the express bus up.  That's what he does.  He knows everything about his bus.  And sometimes it's late, is what he was saying.  When it is bad outside. 
[00:28:30]  I'm beside myself at those clips.  Can we just move all these people to Arkansas or something?  I'm going to laugh when they go, well, wow, we dodged a bullet on this one.  Yeah, that's how it is.  Their excuse is, it's not like we were wrong.  Yeah.  They go, well, you know, one of the models that we had, one of our models, they always 
[00:29:00]  talk about the models.  Yeah.  Said that this might happen, and we dodged a bullet.  I thought you wanted it to happen.  Dummies.  I want to hate Kim Kardashian so bad, but holy mother of...  Picture her up there?  God.  She's got a 2009 calendar.  Danny just shoved it around.  She's there to remind you to buy milk.  Yeah.  There's something about her I hate, but good God. 
[00:29:30]  Who is she?  Like, how is she famous?  She's that stupid Kardashian that was in the OJ trial.  It was, right?  Yeah, that's her father.  Yes.  That's her.  That's his daughter.  Not Daniel.  She is ridiculous.  The rumor is that her and Paris Hilton were friends about a year and a half ago, and she  wanted to be in, but that was when Paris was just getting headlines every single day,  and she was kind of jealous of it, and so she asked Paris what she could do to get her  name out there, so Paris told her to put out a sex tape, and she did. 
[00:30:00]  And it worked.  And it worked.  And now everybody knows who she is.  She's a slut genius.  She's busty.  She's just ridiculously hot.  Vivacious.  She really is.  Who do we plug today?  What would Tyler Durden do?  Dot com?  Actually, today it's the superficial.com.  Superficial.com has some exclusive pics of her account.  Ridiculous.  Go with the lingerie.  Thank you, Danny.  Whoa.  Good God.  She's hair like Amy Winehouse.  Good God.  Snacked up a little high. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, in those shots, but normally she's looking pretty...  She's sucking in and has her hands over her head, by the way.  Yeah.  Just want to tell you, just doing it out.  Doing a little MySpace voodoo in her shots.  A little MySpace voodoo.  Yeah.  Hey, because of the Kim Kardashian stuff, we lost a good phone call.  One guy goes, look, while everyone else is hiding inside from the snow, I'll be out there Christmas shopping.  That's what the news should be saying, that it's a perfect day to go Christmas shopping, because you're going to have a lot of people staying home. 
[00:31:00]  And nothing's going to be out there to impede your travels.  And something you and I learned a long time ago, this is the perfect day to drive into Manhattan, because everyone else stays off the road.  Dude, it was...  You get an in-and-out commute like you've never seen before.  It was a light, light traffic day driving in today.  Because you've got the panicky Pete's, they will take mass transit or stay home and take a sick day.  You will have the easiest commute today.  Oh, did I throw out a racial epithet today?  Boo-f-ah. 
[00:31:30]  Somebody in a minivan in the left lane.  Yeah.  And I'm coming up on them, and I'm like, all right, I'll just pass them in the middle lane.  But their blinker goes on, like they're going to get out of my way.  And I go, all right, that works for me.  I could slow down a little and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait.  This was the longest lane change in my history of driving.  This minivan was moving...  It must have taken a mile to get from the left lane to the middle lane. 
[00:32:00]  And when I passed...  Why don't you just go in the middle lane and get past them?  There's nobody on the road.  Because they were straddling...  Everything?  ...the two lanes, and there was somebody in the right lane.  The right lane's always screwed.  Right, right.  They were straddling, like with the blinker on, like, I'm moving.  I'm getting there.  And I'm trying to squeeze by in the left lane, but not giving me enough room.  So when I finally get past, I have to turn the head and look.  And just think of what is considered the stereotypical worst drivers in the world. 
[00:32:30]  And that's what it was.  And I yelled out the worst possible thing you could yell out in that.  It was a union guy?  Yeah, that was it.  Union guy in a van?  No, they drive like maniacs.  It was a...  Of course it was.  You know.  Yeah.  A...  We're going to remake the Twilight Zone movie, and we're going to make sure you have a fine 
[00:33:00]  role in this.  I'm the guy?  When you're angry with somebody, you don't know.  You're going to be the Vic Morrow character in the new remake of the Twilight Zone.  That's why I don't believe people that say they don't use or think racial epithets.  I don't believe them at all.  Because when you're angry with somebody that you don't know a thing about, except what they  look like, and especially when you're driving, I don't know that person from a hole in the  wall.  I don't want to know. 
[00:33:30]  But all you have is a visual...  That's all you can get on them.  Right.  Is a visual.  Right.  So you turn your head, you look, you hate this person for what they're doing on the road.  Instantly in your head, it snaps in.  I don't care if it's involuntary.  It's going to happen.  Can't argue with you.  So you're a liar if you say you've never even thought of the words.  Every once in a while, you get a celebrity or somebody that says, yeah, I've never said  the word.  I've never thought of the word.  I don't think like that.  I don't...  You know something?  When all you have is the way someone looks, and you are angry with them, that's the only 
[00:34:00]  thing you're going to be able to do.  What are you going to say?  Wow, you don't clean your basement.  You Democrat.  Yeah.  Why you?  No, you look, and it's based on what you see.  Mm-hmm.  That's all.  All right.  Quick break.  Dishonest lying.  Keep the phones ringing.  877-212-ON-A. 
[00:34:30]  Other things to get into.  We'll be watching this snowstorm for everybody.  Don't you worry.  We'll give you the latest info.  Today's a great day to go out and buy volleyballs.  There'll be no congestion in the volleyball aisle.  Balls and eggs.  Opie and Anthony.  Why are you making fun of that guy's wig?  You're a mean, mean person, Jim Norton.  What's the session?  Opie and Anthony.  That's all I think.  Well, Kenny announced that a place we get breakfast will be changing their hours starting Monday, which could throw the whole show into a tizzy, yes. 
[00:35:00]  And then I think Ann said, I hope they don't fire the guy with the bad hair, the bad wig.  Bad hair.  I said, the guy with the potato salad bowl upside down on his head.  And Jimmy Ellis when they put it.  It's horrendous. 
[00:35:30]  What is that?  That's a great hairstyle if you're in charge of the Empire and the Death Star.  He's like the nicest dude.  But he could have the worst hair piece ever.  It's terrible.  He looks like he's at the parlor having his hair dried.  It's because it's not really a hair piece.  It's like it's his entire hair.  Yeah.  You ever see the guys that walk around with the toupees where it's this big curly mop top on top? 
[00:36:00]  And then a completely different color around the sides.  Oh, yeah.  They can't figure that out yet.  Oh, jeez.  What are you doing?  Well, this guy's too young to have such an awful hair piece, first of all.  I think I took a picture of him for Opie's Eye a few months back.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen on the head.  It's a snap-on Lego hair thing where it's just the entire head of hair.  And it's almost like a bowl cut.  So he just pops that thing right on his head. 
[00:36:30]  God knows what's going on.  I didn't eat that.  It's like when you kick a rock over in the summer.  You do centipedes and roly-poly bugs.  Yes.  I bet you when you pull it off, it's just his exposed brain.  He lost his skull years ago.  No, but he's like Ray Liotta at the end of Silence of the Lambs 2 or whatever it was.  Oh, eating his own brains, yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Was that the worst scene in movie history?  Just terrible.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  For a movie that wasn't supposed to be hacky.  What is he, walk downstairs with no top of the...  That's silly.  That was a horrible sequel to a great movie.  One of those that happen every so often.  Yeah, unfortunately.  It's like, oh, God.  I was watching Jaws, you know, the other night.  I hadn't seen it in a while.  It's one of those movies I go to sleep to.  Sure.  One of the five movies that I go to sleep to.  And then Jaws 2 comes on after it. 
[00:37:30]  And then 3D.  And you just realize how that franchise just went right down the crapper.  Oh, my God.  The first one, fantastic.  Filmed amazingly.  And just the characters.  Everything was great.  And the second one's like, eh.  You could get through it, but that whole 70s dry look from Gillette hippie kid look.  Yeah.  Really kind of, you know, isn't that timeless. 
[00:38:00]  And then, oh, anyone after that is horrific.  What else are they supposed to do with the shark, though, really, if you think about it?  The shark in the water.  Jaws, there's not much you really could do with that.  No.  The second movie was kind of worth it.  It's kind of like when you find a new band, like you hear a song on the radio, and you're like, wow, that is a really cool song.  And then you buy the CD, and you're just trying to find that second song you like.  Yeah.  Kind of like that's the Jaws franchise.  But then you're hanging in there with this band, and you realize, wow, they were just a one-hit wonder. 
[00:38:30]  What was I thinking?  Yeah.  Yep.  What was I thinking?  They, in two, I just couldn't get past the fact that, listen to Chief Brody.  Would you listen to him?  The stupid mayor again.  What does he do for the mayor this time?  Chief, you know, everything isn't a shark attack.  Sorry, a killer whale washes up with big shark bites taken out of it.  That could be anything, a boat propeller.  Right.  Stupid mayor. 
[00:39:00]  But doesn't the mayor remember last summer?  Remember when it was a shark?  And a little boy was eaten alive in front of his mom and dad?  You told me.  There was a, we caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured a few bathers.  I love how he underscored that people were chewed up, bitten in half.  Right.  Little kittener boy swallowed whole.  Little Chrissy was found just her hand and her head.  Right.  A few bathers were possibly injured. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Bathers.  Yeah, bathers.  But it's a beautiful day and Amity, Amity does mean friendship.  He's wearing his dumb anchor suit.  That stupid anchor suit.  I love it.  I want one.  With his anchors.  Why didn't the people demand that he stepped down from his post?  Oh, mayor.  You're not doing a good job.  People are being eaten alive by a shark.  Mayor, you stink.  Right.  I think we need a new guy in here to figure this out. 
[00:40:00]  How awful was his opponent that he couldn't unseat that mayor?  What was his opponent's, like, campaign strategy, a platform?  Yes.  I intend to have more residents eaten by sharks.  Than my opponent did.  I promise to only have your legs bitten off.  Oh.  Yeah, he won again.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, that was sort of a problem, sir.  Those young hoodlums hung up by their Buster Browns. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Who'd be running against that mayor?  Marion Barry?  Stinks.  His anchor suit.  His anchor suit was so great.  Why don't you go in the water?  He's telling the people to get in the water.  They're horrified to get in there.  He just wants to have a big Fourth of July.  Why did that old couple go in the water?  First of all, they were too old to have kids to begin with.  Yeah, yeah.  They had the little kids on the raft.  They might have been grandkids or something.  And then the mayor, like, forces that old couple to go in the water. 
[00:41:00]  Couldn't that old couple go, F you, I've been living here for 40 years.  Why do I have to go in the water?  I don't know.  What kind of power did he have over that old couple?  They probably had, like, some nasty, nasty, naughty shots of that guy or something.  Increased their taxes or something.  Right.  Some stupid mayor thing.  That scene is good because they push the kids out, and the woman's just kind of looking around like,  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  What the hell's out there?  But my favorite part in Jaws is when there's that panic to leave the water because the kids 
[00:41:30]  with the little cardboard fin that are out there, and everyone's running, and there's  that one woman who just has no survival instinct whatsoever.  She's standing in the water holding her kid, just going, Ah!  Ah!  Just screaming, not moving at all.  Yeah.  No survival instinct ever.  Safety is 20 feet away in the form of sand that you can stand on, but she's going to stay 
[00:42:00]  in the water.  Let's prove that, wouldn't you?  Right.  Get your name in the National Geographic.  And the one scene that was so bad is when, like, in the background, like, you see all  these, the shark is just eating people, and the mayor is on the beach by the water facing  the, uh, the people on the beach, and he's just kind of, uh, he's doing the buffalo shuffle.  Jimmy.  I'm tired.  Oh, man.  How ridiculous would that look?  All right, mayor, cue the mayor.  Do the buffalo shuffle. 
[00:42:30]  All right, and the blood in the water.  Yeah, there's arms getting spit out, the sharks, like, just popping heads off.  He's facing people.  I didn't sleep last night.  Yeah, mad water.  Uh, you guys did hear they're remaking Jaws, right?  No.  And they're thinking, they're thinking of, um, casting Eddie Murphy.  Eddie Murphy's getting all this work.  Yeah, they're thinking of.  But Eddie Murphy's supposed to be in the next Batman, Eddie Murphy, and Jaws.  I can't see that.  But this is our new bit. 
[00:43:00]  Uh, so Eddie Murphy's gonna, they're thinking of casting him in the new Jaws movie.  Oh, what, as what part?  Chief Brody?  I'm not really sure.  They, they're not really sure what part yet.  Uh-huh.  But they want to make it, like, you know, family friendly and stuff.  Uh-huh.  Hey, speaking of movies, uh, a lot of, I don't know, a lot of movies coming out.  I was gonna say a lot of good movies, but then you look at this list and you realize,  not really.  The Tale of Desper-  How do you say that?  Desper-  Desper-  Desper-  Desper-  Because they spell it D-E-S-P-E-R-E-A-U-X. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, the Frenchie thing.  What is that about?  Desper-  Desper-  Desper-  It's a kid's movie.  It's about a little mouse who, uh, brings joy to everybody.  So if it's a kid's movie, why do they have to go with the big word in the title?  I don't know.  Good question.  Because it brings joy.  How about a mouse that brings might, and they bite the children?  It's a mouse that brings fleas, and the father steps on it.  It brings the Hantavirus.  Yeah, that's good.  And the father angrily steps on his mouse back.  Well, it's getting 43% positive reviews. 
[00:44:00]  But it's a kid's movie.  Shouldn't all those movies get, like, 100% positive reviews?  What is a kid?  Is he gonna, like, get critical after he sees one of these dumb flicks?  A kid's gonna be a critic.  Right.  I wasn't moved by this like I was, uh, the first time I saw Toy Story.  And lucky us, we got a new Jim Carrey movie to check out this weekend.  Thank God.  And we all love Jim Carrey here on the Opie and Anthony show, don't we?  Oh, boy.  Um, we did.  Uh, Yes Man getting 36% positive reviews. 
[00:44:30]  That's not very good.  These guys go to Hollywood, and they listen to those Hollywood dopes, and they just, just, just, just become something very, very different.  What happened?  We were talking about Eddie Murphy, the last really good movie he did, and we went back to 1988, I think it was it?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Jim Carrey, let's do that today.  The last Jim Carrey movie where the average schmo went, wow, that's a good movie.  Not the stuff that did well at the box office, because the lemmings ran out and went and saw it. 
[00:45:00]  The last one where the average schmo across the board would go, yeah, that was his last good movie.  Cable Guy.  They're going to go with Cable Guy?  It's not a Christmas Carol.  Uh, well, those are coming out.  Uh, Horton Hears a Who?  No.  No.  The number 23?  No.  Lemon, Lemony Snickets?  No.  A Series of Unfortunate Events?  No.  Well, I would go with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  That would be mine, 2004.  I didn't like that.  So that's four, four and a half years ago. 
[00:45:30]  I didn't see it.  What's before that, because I never saw that one?  Bruce Almighty, Could Have Been Good, Pecan Pie, The Majestic, I don't know.  How the Grinch Stole Christmas?  Were you a fan of that movie?  No.  The average schmo?  No.  No?  All right, let's keep going.  Me, Myself, and Irene.  That was a pretty decent hit.  Was that with Owen Wilson?  Was old Percy Lipson in that one?  I don't know.  There's old fractal Percy Lips in the middle one, who makes the little O mouth.  He's got his little hands on his hip.  Oh, so sexy. 
[00:46:00]  Old schlong nose.  Oh, that stupid nose.  Oh, my.  No.  So, Renee Zellweger.  So sexy.  Percy Lips.  Irene was Renee Zellweger.  Oh.  And, wow, was she something to look at when she was younger.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Renee Zellweger.  She was something.  So, maybe that movie?  Sounds like they combined, yeah, her name with K-Fed.  I had a great idea for a movie. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  You know, those Pixar movies are fantastic.  Oh, my God, are they?  Everyone loves them.  And they make, like, you know, cars, and they give them personalities and everything, and  little toys and things like that.  How about Pixar Presents Guns?  Where they're friendly, fun guns.  You know, you got your big ones and then your small little ones with the little high voices,  and they could go around and be the kid's friends.  This is going great. 
[00:47:00]  Wouldn't it be fantastic?  Yes.  And what the kid does when the kid wants candy, he puts the gun in his mouth, and he presses  the dispenser, and yummy candy goes in his mouth.  Candy comes out.  Yeah, I'm the candy dispensing gun.  And they all have, like, those big Pixar eyes, and they walk around, and each one has, like,  a purpose.  And there's a big, rough guy.  He'd be like the Desert Eagle.  And he walks around, and then a little Derringer is always getting into trouble and has to  be bailed out by his friends, the 9mm. 
[00:47:30]  You could have Ruger and Glock, and they could all have accents.  Yeah, yeah, have accents, depending on that.  Oh, the parents, first of all, I think would love it.  Yeah.  Because they can appreciate it as adults, and the kids just love the different colors  and the voices and the fun that they could have then with guns.  You're going to have to get, like, Jeff Foxworthy or somebody to do a voice, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the blue-collar comedy guys, for sure.  It would be, like, blue-collar guy, and then a gangster guy for the Glock, one of the,  or, uh...  Winchester could be Foxworthy. 
[00:48:00]  Yes, yes.  You could have, like, a Southern name, like Winchester or Colt.  Winchester.  Come here, Colt.  Colt.  Or maybe the kid's being bullied at school, and then a couple of the guns go,  well, take us to school.  We'll talk to the bullies.  We'll talk to them.  We'll work it out for you.  Well, okay, that sounds good.  And then they go to the school, and the guns help the kid with the bully.  Yes.  That's, I think, a fantastic...  Think how cute they'd look, because those Pixar things are adorable.  They make little cars look cute and fun.  Big, sad eyes on guns. 
[00:48:30]  I'll look into it.  I don't know what to do with that.  Sorry.  I'm going to pitch that.  I don't know what else you're going to do that.  I actually think that it could be a great, great movie.  What outrage would that be?  And the promo is a bunch of little kids holding one, just throwing the gun back and forth to each other like it's a red ball.  And the gun's going, whoa, whoa. 
[00:49:00]  You know, he's hitting the floor and firing off through his nose.  Yeah.  Puts a hole in the ceiling.  No, no, no.  The bullets come out, they hit the kid.  And when the bullet hits the kid, little hands come out of the bullet and go, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.  And he goes, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.  For the premiere, you could have little kids walking the red carpet with guns.  Yeah, with guns.  Like they're dealing with Marley and me.  Everybody's walking the red carpet with a dog.  Yeah.  All the outrage.  And then giveaways.  They give away guns. 
[00:49:30]  Why don't you, you know, why don't you start working on it in your basement?  Oh, please.  I can't wait.  Get it into something.  Like I got some rough little treatment there.  and then send that out, and you watch that get scooped up.  You watch it get scooped up.  Yeah.  So Jim Carrey's Yes Man, 36% positive reviews, 7 pounds.  Now, that's the Will Smith movie that we all saw the trailer for in the movie theater  the last few months.  That's the Karen Carpenter story. 
[00:50:00]  I used to throw up.  You couldn't eat, and then you died.  You're one of the weak we make fun of.  Wait, wait.  What is 7 pounds about?  What is it?  You know, I saw a million trailers, and I couldn't figure it out.  No?  Because I'm just stupid.  I couldn't figure it out.  And who's in that?  Will Smith.  Could you give me the synopsis of 7 pounds?  It's got something to do with British money.  An IRS agent with a fateful secret. 
[00:50:30]  Not much of it.  An IRS agent with a fateful secret embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption  by forever changing the lives of seven strangers.  That says it all right there.  7 pounds?  I don't know.  Oh, he's had sex with seven people, and they're calling them pounds?  Maybe it's something to do with a pound of flesh.  Seven people.  Damn it.  Didn't we do that movie with, what was it called?  Where, like, when you die, your body loses a certain amount, and it's... 
[00:51:00]  Something grams.  Something grams, 28 grams, 21 grams, or whatever.  That was a deeply depressing movie.  Sean Penn, right?  Again, Sean Penn.  Benicio Del Toro.  He may be an ass, but, man, that guy could act.  Sure can.  7 pounds, 30% positive reviews.  Not good.  Will Smith finally has a bomb.  Yeah.  But people will run out and see it.  It'll do very well.  And then a movie I saw last night I was lucky enough to see, because Stunt Brain had a  copy, The Wrestler, with Mickey Rourke.  Oh, wow. 
[00:51:30]  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Great movie.  Wow.  Was that a good movie.  Here's even better news about The Wrestler.  Yeah.  Because I said to you yesterday, like, I'd love to see it, and Mike said he only had  one copy.  So I said to Opie today, like, dude, how was it?  He goes, it was great.  Mickey Rourke was great.  I'm like, excellent, man.  I really want to see it.  But then Mike goes, Travis has it.  I'm like, ah.  Travis, hand over The Wrestler.  How does Travis have it before Jimmy Norton?  He didn't know.  He wasn't trying to be a player.  Know your place. 
[00:52:00]  Know your place.  Hand over The Wrestler.  There's a pecking order here.  Thank you.  Nobody said Jimmy Norton.  No, no.  No one said that to him.  It was just that I could have asked Travis for it.  He would have went, oh, yeah, here.  But the joy.  Yes, yes.  Of doing it in that fashion.  Yeah, yeah.  Where he thought he was going to see it tonight.  If I had one ounce of moral courage, I would have waited until 5 of 11 and said, hand it  over, bitch.  Thank you, Travis.  I'll bring this back next week unless Anthony wants to do it.  Oh, I absolutely want to see it.  Do you want it first?  No, no. 
[00:52:30]  You see it first.  I don't mind.  And then I'll get it next week.  Yeah.  And, yeah, I'll see you Monday.  Then I've got to wait until January.  No, go to the theater with the rest of the losers.  Did Danny see it?  No, I'd like to.  Oh, see, Danny's got to see it.  Oh, Danny's got to see it, sure.  Let's have a burn party.  I'll burn it and give, I mean, um.  Oh.  I already did that last night.  You know why?  Because that's Stunt Brain's copy and they know they gave it to Stunt Brain?  Yeah, they encode it.  I made at least 100 copies last night.  I'll be selling them on 57th Street.  Stunt Brain will get all in.  Oh, yeah, he'll be arrested by the feds.  Do we still have feds? 
[00:53:00]  Feds.  Will the feds be knocking down Stunt Brain's door?  How do they know it's yours, Mike?  Do they actually just embed an AH into it?  Yes.  Yes.  I was a little confused because I was thinking Adolf Hitler right off the bat.  Oh, no.  But then I got the joke, Jimmy.  It would be if I had it first.  The wrestler, Mickey Rourke.  Good movie, right?  It certainly was, Jimmy.  It certainly was. 
[00:53:30]  And if you know anything about the wrestling game, man, did they nail this movie.  Because what happens to a lot of these wrestlers that we know and love, when they're on the big stage, they look like rock stars.  And then their time has slipped away.  And they're still wrestling in these smaller little leagues in Jersey and whatnot.  Yep.  And, you know, it's a sad ending to a great career.  I'm going to watch this if I get time. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know.  If I have time, I'll watch it this weekend.  If not, sometime next week.  If not, whenever you're done with it, I'll take it.  So, you know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, whatever.  Sunday, Friday, Tuesday.  Maybe then over Christmas, if you need to hold on to it until then, maybe when we come back, whatever.  I actually want to see it again.  Oh, yeah.  So, put me back on the list of getting the movie back.  Guess what?  Dumbbells are going to be getting texts every 15 minutes in the middle of the movie as to how great it is.  Yeah.  And guess who's going to have the ending texted for them?  Spoilers. 
[00:54:30]  And Marissa Tomei turning into a slut.  She's naked again.  That's good.  She's naked again.  Oh, look who's on TV.  Who?  Oh, we had her on.  Yeah.  But Marissa Tomei is naked a lot in this movie, The Wrestler.  She still looks pretty good.  Absolutely.  You've got to give it to her.  She's got to be in her 40s at this point.  Yeah.  44.  44.  And she plays a stripper on her way out.  Oh, yeah.  She's at the end of her career as well.  And, yeah, she's naked. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  She doesn't look good in that picture, Danny.  What the F?  What is that?  I guess she slimmed down for her role in The Wrestler, huh?  What happened to her hair?  Is that?  No, it's the other one.  Look at the butt.  She's walking with a gentleman.  A bald guy.  Shaved head.  Oh, look at the butt.  Yuck.  Yuck.  You could smack that around, no?  You didn't see that butt in The Wrestler.  She must have went anorexic to get ready for the role.  She was naked in The Devil Before The Devil Knows You're Dead or whatever that movie was.  She was sexy in that, too.  That was a great movie that no one saw. 
[00:55:30]  I did like it, yeah.  All right.  There we go.  Matt and Howard Beach is going to tell us what 7 Pounds is all about.  By the way, The Wrestler, 97% positive reviews.  Wow.  That's big.  Who was the idiot that said, ah, Hulk H?  Give me the one bad review that it got.  I want to see what this guy said about the movie.  Mickey Rourke with a comeback movie.  Yeah.  His career was dead.  He kind of plays sort of the ultimate warrior.  Yeah.  It's not the ultimate warrior, but that type of character. 
[00:56:00]  That type of wrestler.  Yeah.  Matt and Howard Beach.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Matt.  I was listening to the news this morning on Channel 7, and they said 7 pounds is your weight of your organs in your body.  We did this movie.  We did the Grams movie.  What?  Yeah.  What is he redoing the Grams movie then?  I'd say your organs have to weigh more than 7 pounds.  I thought, but that's what they said. 
[00:56:30]  Maybe after you ring them out, get all the gook out of them.  Yeah, yeah.  You ring them out and render them down to...  Only 7 pounds?  Does that include external ones?  Because that would all depend on where you grew up.  So what does that mean?  I have no idea.  It doesn't look bloody or gory.  All right.  Hey, was that Hitchcock movie good?  Which one?  Where he played the superhero.  The blades?  Oh, Hancock, whatever. 
[00:57:00]  I was going to say Hitchcock.  Sorry.  He's a superhero?  I know, right?  It's exactly what you'd expect it to be.  You go to the movies.  You buy popcorn.  You eat your popcorn.  And you're like, oh, Will Smith is a homeless superhero.  And then you leave.  Is it kind of funny at times?  Yeah.  You know.  Some people say it's a good movie.  I think he'd have been a fine superhero.  I forget Scott.  Yeah.  Good evening.  I finally saw Batman in its entirety. 
[00:57:30]  I caught bits and pieces of it and everything.  Finally saw it on Blu-ray, mind you.  Nice.  Wow.  Really cool.  But with all the talking that went on about that movie in this very studio,  it was just kind of destroyed.  I enjoyed the hell out of it.  But the voice, the voice that annoys Jimmy so much.  I almost got it, though, like why he put it on. 
[00:58:00]  I think it was something in the suit.  Like I think it's supposed to be something like to, yeah, to cover up who he is.  That's cool.  Then maybe he should wear a full mask and not a half a mask.  How about he wears like a ski mask and then no one knows him?  Why are you wearing a little thing with bat ears on it?  But you got to be.  Why are you teasing everybody?  Exactly.  Yeah.  We kind of half know who you are.  We have an idea, but we're not sure.  Yeah.  But the Joker scenes were, every scene was fantastic. 
[00:58:30]  Wasn't he great?  That he was in.  What he does with the little nurse outfit on.  Dude.  It's so goddamn funny.  He's walking away from the hospital waiting for it to blow up.  He's just kind of pressing the button.  He just looks like his mouth is dry and disgusting and pasty and he sounds it.  And he looks like the type of, he looks like you feel when you're on three or four days without sleep.  Yeah.  Which he probably did for the role.  Yeah, he probably did. 
[00:59:00]  I guess they said that he was doing that type of thing.  That little hair comb thing he does, that greasy mess of a hair when he's like, hey.  Hello, beautiful.  Hello, beautiful.  Meanwhile, he wants to put a knife in her mouth and slice it from the cheek out.  I love when he sits down in the nurse outfit and he goes, hi.  Yeah, hi.  I know he just burns your girl in a gas fire.  Hi.  You know, like, oh boy.  Yeah, the facial expressions. 
[00:59:30]  It's like, yeah, because you're a freak.  I'm not a freak.  I'm a, okay, look.  He just stops in midstream.  Okay, look.  When the guy goes, do you think you could steal our money and walk away?  And he goes, yeah.  Yeah.  There's some really funny moments in that movie.  Yeah, very, very good.  Do you think he gets the Oscar?  I actually would love to see it.  I would love to see him get it because I was so wrapped up in him.  Like, not just, oh, the Joker was crazy, but just watching the little things he did as an actor. 
[01:00:00]  I really enjoyed it, man.  I loved it.  I think Hollywood likes to be so cool that they're probably going to turn around and not give it to him  because it's like everyone wants it.  Like, they think he deserves it.  Expensive or something, yeah.  But he's dead.  Not because he's dead, but because it was just an amazing, an amazing role.  Hollywood loves him from Brokeback, too, though.  I bet you he does get it.  Oh, that's a good point, Jimmy.  They love Heath Ledger, man.  He's like, he's a made man in Hollywood.  They love the gay in Hollywood.  Yeah.  They're big fans of the gay.  Speaking of movies, something we've been sitting on for a while, Christian Bale's going to be in the Terminator, right? 
[01:00:30]  Like, they're redoing that whole thing?  Well, no.  It's actually the fourth one in the series, Terminator Salvation, where Christian Bale plays a grown-up John Connor leading the war.  Dile!  Really?  A grown-up John Connor.  Yeah, no one.  So this one takes place in the future.  Yes, the actual future war against the machines.  Yeah, so he was able to grow up, so there was an urgency in those movies.  Well, they made it so urgent that the whole world was ending, but the kid was able to grow up.  He's got to grow up so he could send back and even be born. 
[01:01:00]  And they've made little adjustments throughout the series where, you know, every little change kind of affects the timeline just a little bit.  A little bit, yeah.  It kind of deviated from the original storyline in the first place.  Well, if you remember some other movie, I can't remember the name, but if you alter something, the timeline gets altered.  Oh, my God, no, not that.  And perhaps a big casino gets started.  Please, no.  And there's a really cool museum that opens up.  Yeah, yeah, a good museum. 
[01:01:30]  I believe it's the Biff Tannen.  Please, God.  Oh, oh.  A blizzard.  Wait.  The Biff Tannen Museum.  Yes.  Dedicated to Hill Valley's number one citizen.  Who?  And America's greatest living folk.  Who?  The one and only Biff Tannen.  Yes.  Of course we've all heard the legend.  Of course.  But who's the man?  Inside, you will learn how Biff Tannen became one of the richest and most powerful men in America.  Learn the amazing history of the Tannen family.  Amazing.  Starting with his great-grandfather, Buford Mad Dog Tannen.  Fastest gun in the West. 
[01:02:00]  Biggest over-actor in the West.  And how a trip to the racetrack on his 21st birthday made him a millionaire overnight.  Overnight.  How?  As he tried to rape the girlfriend of another man.  How did he get so lucky?  With all those sports bets.  What did he have?  Gray's Sports Almanac.  Gray's Sports Almanac.  Dun-dun-dun. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's what happens when timelines are affected, though.  Bad things can happen.  Can they?  Yeah.  I hate you both.  I do not love Biff Tannen.  Anyway.  The whole reason this is brought up in the first place is because Christian Bale seems  to be on his Batman voice kick, even in the Salvation trailer.  Really?  Yeah.  It's coming through.  So I have a feeling that all throughout Terminator Salvation, we're going to be hearing little  remnants of the Dark Knight. 
[01:03:00]  Here we go.  Here's a little sample.  I thought I knew our enemy.  This is Batman.  This is Batman.  Batman goes and helps out the Terminator.  Don't be confused.  This is not Batman audio.  Oh, no.  Are you kidding me?  It's this close?  I can't tell you how happy it made me to see Jim's face.  Oh, wow.  He stinks.  Dude, that was exactly like the Batman voice.  Why doesn't he...  I thought I knew our enemy. 
[01:03:30]  But I don't know if we can win this war.  Wow.  I know who your enemy is.  It's Variety.  Did he make the two movies at the same time?  No, I think he did Dark Knight first, and then this was after.  Where's the Patrick Bateman voice?  We are outnumbered by machines.  Go, go, go!  And we have all lost so very much. 
[01:04:00]  But this is not the future my mother warned me about.  Who are you?  I'm Batman.  John Connor.  John Connor.  That's changed.  Yeah.  I'm John Connor.  Yes.  I won't say I was a bit busy.  Wouldn't you feel bad if you found out he had...  We've been at war.  ...throat cancer.  This is before either episode.  Yeah, I feel bad for the actor that should have gotten involved.  Who doesn't? 
[01:04:30]  You drank into my mother.  You killed my father.  If we stay the course, we are dead.  We are all dead.  You will not kill me.  You know what?  If you didn't know any better, we should have played this and asked people.  They would have said, well, that's obviously...  Here's the new Batman trailer or whatever.  Wow.  Didn't know any better.  Unbelievable.  By the way, seven pounds might be what your brain weighs.  What? 
[01:05:00]  That's what's coming in now, too.  Seven pounds?  Yeah.  Oh, well, unless...  Because it was said in Jerry Maguire, so I'm not saying it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That little Lipnicki kid, I think, said it.  Yeah.  Well, it depends on the type of haircut you're sporting.  Of course, what's your last name?  If the haircut is Moe Howard-ish, that seven pounds probably changes a little bit.  Then the conversion.  Yeah.  That's the conversion rate.  Yeah, exactly.  Oof.  It's six pounds of skull. 
[01:05:30]  Or just atrophied tissue.  It's like a tied-off balloon.  Like the little knot is still functional.  And the rest is just worthless mush.  I just got the spoiler.  That's what seven pounds is?  I don't know.  I mean, I didn't check it for its factual accuracy.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, go see that horse crap this weekend.  And then call Monday and go, yuck. 
[01:06:00]  Opie and Anthony will continue.  Jerks.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, that's not going to work today.  877-212-ON-A.  We got it now.  There's a stunt.  There we go.  That felt good.  And I'm happy to report that Mindy McCready is on the mend. 
[01:06:30]  Thank God.  Thank God for all you country fans out there.  And all you Roger Clemens fans out there.  You want to ask what happened to Mindy there, Ant?  Yeah, I have no clue.  Wow.  Mindy McCready is that country artist.  Hopefully it involves tearing.  That allegedly had an affair with what?  Roger Clemens?  Is it allegedly still or what?  I think so.  Was it proven?  Well, Mindy decided to slit her wrists. 
[01:07:00]  To, of course, kill herself.  And I'm proud to report that she's on the mend this morning.  And she's going to be just fine.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Good for her.  Another attention-seeking ass.  Not a fan of the wrist cut.  I'm sorry.  You're not trying to kill yourself.  You're looking for attention. 
[01:07:30]  I will say that every single time.  What about the people that really, like, do it?  And then die from it?  Yeah, yeah.  Very small percentage, Anthony.  Because I know a little something about this.  And I did a little research.  Very small percentage.  And those are the ones that didn't time it out right.  They thought somebody was going to be home.  They make the phone call.  And that person decided to catch a late movie.  And now you're too weak to go get your own towel to wrap around your wounds.  The people that really gouge it out, though? 
[01:08:00]  No?  You get a few of those.  Yeah.  But I'm talking about the ones that just go slip.  And that's it.  So, um, she's sitting up in her hospital bed.  Thank God.  She's on the mend.  And was hoping to be with her family for the holidays.  Aw.  But a mere day or two ago, you were hoping not to be around for the holidays.  Right?  Right?  Oh, did she say she's hoping to?  Yes.  But, yeah, then she wasn't hoping.  Right.  To be with her family for the holidays. 
[01:08:30]  A day after her apparent suicide attempt.  Also known as the old attention getter.  I guess she's okay now, then.  She's doing wonderful.  She's sitting up in great spirit.  Said Brent Young, a close friend of Mindy's.  Who, of course, ran to the hospital.  Playing right into what she was looking for.  She's focusing on seeing her son, Xander.  And going to Florida to be with her family for Christmas.  This is her, huh? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, thank God she's going to be A-OK.  This is every chick country song.  Well, country's like rap.  How do you know when you're listening to a bad country song or a bad rap song?  How do you really know?  I don't know if I live in this crap anymore.  You were listening to this crap?  I had to. 
[01:09:30]  For a woman?  Yeah.  I guess we do some crazy things for our women out there.  Yes.  This was one you just didn't enjoy?  No.  The country music?  I wasn't really feeling that country music thing.  You made believe you were, though, right?  No.  No.  I was pretty honest about my hatred of country music.  Yeah.  It was just on all the time.  But, yeah.  I was like, oh, Christ.  Enough already.  Let's say hi to Tim on Long Island.  Tim.  What up, boys?  How are you?  I'm good.  I'm good.  Good.  Saw Seven Pounds. 
[01:10:00]  You saw Seven Pounds.  The new Will Smith movie.  Right.  And?  Yeah.  And I don't know if you can, can I spoil?  I don't want to spoil.  Nah, let's not do the spoil thing.  But there is organs involved.  No male ones.  Just organs.  You know.  Was it a good movie there, Tim?  You know what?  It wasn't horrible.  Will Smith actually was very good.  But that is very confusing.  See, I don't want to go see a movie where someone goes, eh, it wasn't horrible.  Well, you know what? 
[01:10:30]  I didn't have to worry about going to see it.  So, you know, thank God for the internet.  But, you know, he was good.  The movie, eh, it was all right.  It was a sad ending other than that.  You know what's coming towards the middle of the movie.  You can cut yourself for it.  Thanks.  So, that's really, that's my synopsis.  I've got to tell you, the wrestler had a surprise ending.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who saw that coming?  Dead the whole movie?  Who saw that coming?  The wrestler.  Boy, what a twist they had there. 
[01:11:00]  Probably figure it out.  How about you figure it out in the opening credits what's going to happen?  I think I know.  Well, well, well, well, well.  Um, he, uh, shaves his head off and becomes the landlord.  Mm-hmm.  For a wacky, um, threesome.  That's just like the worst guest ever guy.  Yeah.  What do you think happened?  Hey, you're actually at the department store? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, worst guest guest.  Uh-huh.  Good.  Guest.  You were right there, too, actually, at one point.  Ow.  Let's not give away the ending to Seven Pounds, okay?  Because there's people out there that want to see this.  I wouldn't mind seeing it.  I want to know if people didn't like it because they don't like seeing Will Smith in a certain type of role.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Sometimes people don't like to see their guys be unhappy.  Yeah.  He was in that movie where he played the, what, homeless guy with a kid recently. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, that was a huge movie.  Happiness.  Yeah, yeah.  That was huge.  But that was, you know, kind of a, it wasn't the old Independence Day kind of.  No, it was a real role for him.  True story, though.  Was it?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And it's, uh, you know, with Jaden, I think, his son, so it's, like, him and his real kid together.  Oh, okay.  Mm-hmm.  Nepotism, that's always, always nice.  Hmm.  I auditioned for the part of his son, and they said I wasn't right.  Your son. 
[01:12:30]  Tempting to bring you.  A cook.  All right.  Yeah.  And as I look outside, I see, um...  What?  Nothing.  Still nothing?  We were supposed to have six inches by now.  I see we have, um...  Wow, everything's covered in, uh, daylight. 
[01:13:00]  It's really about it.  No snow.  No nothing.  Look, they're still, they're showing a live shot of a bus, and it couldn't be clearer, that picture.  Looks like it just came through a car wash.  There's nothing wrong with it.  No.  All right, we'll move on with some other things.  Yeah, the Colts, uh, they're gonna be in the, uh, playoffs.  Good for them.  Oh, yeah?  Peyton Manning had a fine game last night, though.  Beat the Jaguars. 
[01:13:30]  31-24.  Nice.  That was a good one.  Oh, Jimmy.  Hey, you guys wanna hear Tom Cruise?  He's got a big movie coming out.  The Valkyries?  Valkyrie.  Oh, the Valkyrie.  Oh, the Valkyrie, whatever.  Oh, I wanna see that.  It's about the, um, a terrible event.  The attempted assassination of, uh, Adolf Hitler.  Terrible because it, uh, didn't go down, right?  Well, that's what I mean, of course.  Uh-huh.  Because, uh, you know, someone screwed up, moved that briefcase to the last minute.  Is that how it, uh...  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  That big wooden table.  Did it just spoil the movie?  No, it's history, goddammit.  Oh.  It's not like they change it.  You probably, I didn't know what happened, but it's obviously, it's very easy to find.  Yeah.  Was Adolf Hitler, like, an organ donor after he died?  Uh, not quite.  No?  After you poured, uh, some kerosene or gasoline on top of you, I don't think it's easy to  donate your organs.  Well, it would have been a nice thing to do, you know, spread your organs around after  you die.  Donate your mustache.  Or if you think...  To a museum.  Or at least if you think you're gonna die, that'd be a nice thing to do. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, this is the whole thing.  Talking about the Valkyrie.  It's not just so much the, um, the, uh, actual assassination moment.  It's the whole thing behind it.  Yeah.  So it's not ruining anything.  Was Adolf, uh, a fan of the number seven?  Why?  Just asking.  I don't know.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Just saying.  No, it's not the other one, but... 
[01:15:00]  I don't know that one, Ian.  Number seven.  Mm-hmm.  Do you like the number seven?  I...  Yes.  Okay.  I have no idea what that means.  I would bet ten people do, though.  Really?  Yeah.  I'd like to perform for ten people instead of the million that are listening.  Hmm. 
[01:15:30]  I have no idea what you're talking about.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I wanted.  Tom Cruise on Letterman, top ten list.  You want to hear this?  Uh, yes.  I heard he was mad.  He said, can we call it the bottom ten?  Dave said, no.  Oh, wow.  Hold on.  Let me sit down.  Wow.  Did you just...  Did you just pull a hammy on that one?  We've got to take the paddles to Jim on that one.  Oof.  I threw my soul out. 
[01:16:00]  Can we bring in the joke trainer?  Can we pull something?  Oof.  Oh, my good God.  No.  I should have a, uh, I should have a pie thrown in my face.  Oh, to say the least.  With rocks, a rock pie.  From a shotgun.  A pellet pie.  Yes.  And, because I know you're confused, and before we can move on, I'm just going to let you off the hook here. 
[01:16:30]  This is what I was getting at.  Hmm?  Hmm.  Oh, oh, okay.  And a few people, uh, did get it.  I don't, I, I kind of heard that, but I don't think it's really, uh, well, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  No, good old, uh, Adolf, uh, yeah, you know, took a little poison, blew his brains out, they took him out back, burnt him.  And then, ta-da!  That was it.  Ta-da!  Uh, yeah, his whole, his whole career was just the aristocrat joke. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  After he burned himself, he went, ta-da, the aristocrat.  Yeah, let's see how brave those aristocrat comedians really are.  I want you to work a little Hitler into your act.  Yeah, right up until that one.  And then go the aristocrats.  Ah.  See how that works out for you.  Stephen Basio was saying he could show me the exact spot that that, uh, happened, where, uh, was outside his bunker.  Da bunker. 
[01:17:30]  Well, you could see where Hitler died?  Yeah, where he, uh, was, uh, burned, I would gather.  Really?  Yeah.  Is his bunker still there or no?  Uh, yeah, apparently.  Is it?  Is the bunker still, das Bunker, uh, still there?  Yes, it's under a parking lot, is what Steve from Bayshore says.  And Steve from Bayshore knows everything about, uh, old Dolph.  Isn't that an insult to cars?  What, you're insulting the car?  Yeah, by building a parking lot over the whole thing. 
[01:18:00]  All right, here we go.  Tom Cruise on David Letterman.  I heard this was terrific.  He did the top ten list as he, uh, promotes his new movie.  Okay.  Category.  No, let me start.  No, from the home office in Wahoo, Nebraska.  Tonight's top ten.  Okay.  This is, the topic is...  Uh-oh.  The craziest things people say about Tom Cruise on the internet.  Oh.  That's a good, that's a good category. 
[01:18:30]  That's a...  Okay.  Oh, look at Tom.  The new Tom Cruise.  A little self-deprecating, uh, humor, perhaps.  Uh, he seemed a little tripped up there, though.  Yeah.  Well, because they just handed it to him.  It wasn't very natural.  He doesn't see it ahead of time.  It's the new Tom Cruise, though.  He could take a joke.  He wants everyone to know he could actually take a joke.  I think he realizes what a douche he came off like with Matt Lauer.  Oh, he's already apologized for all that publicly.  Yeah, he just was a douche.  He said, ah, I was out of control. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know what I was doing.  I sleep upside down, suspended, and a special bat-like harness.  I've heard that.  Number nine, during the filming of Days of Thunder, on a dare, I ate a tire.  Number eight, I still wear those underpants from Risky Business.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Number seven, my real name is Tom Blagojevich. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, that's right.  The thing he doesn't know how to do is, like, let the laugh finish first.  No, no, his timing is horrible.  Nervous Nelly?  Oh.  You relax?  Yeah, come on.  You're a star, for God's sake.  Here's how he does it.  Do you have the laugh track?  Sure.  Okay.  He just keeps stopping the, ah, number six, do you wear the underpants from Risky Business?  Number five.  He goes right into it. 
[01:20:00]  Number five, during the making of Days of Thunder, I ate a tire.  Number four.  Stop laughing.  Number four.  Stop the laughter.  Why did he do that?  Oh, no.  Come on.  Number six, I once, what's this?  Oof.  I can't read it.  A vagina.  I once, hi. 
[01:20:30]  There it is.  There it is.  I'm sure you've heard that rumor, huh, Mr. Cruz?  Bravo to Jim Norton.  Third show going on sale today, 10 o'clock, Borgata, Atlantic City.  Oh, my God.  Well, if he's talking about internet rumors.  Yeah, of course.  Number six, I once, what's this? 
[01:21:00]  We might have to do a few what's thises.  What's thises?  We might have to do a few what's thiseses.  Anyone have one?  How do you beat that?  Number six, I once, what's this?  You can't read it.  Yes, I once, I'm like a koala.  Number five, once a month, I take the Universal tour naked. 
[01:21:30]  Number four, I believe all emotional and psychological disorders can be cured with Vicks Vaporub.  There you go.  He's crying.  Okay, number three, I'm a power-mad egomaniac who's completely insulated from reality.  Oh, wait, that's Letterman.  I've got to say, it's not as bad as I thought.  That last one wasn't good, but. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, it's self-deprecating.  I think he realized how much that hurt his movie last time he did that.  What movie was he plugging?  I don't remember.  Was it Mission Impossible 3 or some crap?  When he went off on a tear like that and people were just kind of, hmm, hmm, hmm.  I don't remember.  And he's got this movie coming out and I think he really wants it to hit, so.  He's playing a Nazi.  Yeah.  He's going into it with a whimsical attitude.  He can't figure anything out, this guy.  Throw caution to the wind.  He should be an ass this time around. 
[01:22:30]  Good observation, Jimmy.  Number two, after jumping on her couch,  Oprah hammerlocked me till I coughed blood.  Ouch.  Really?  Hammerlocked you?  That's awful.  And the number one craziest thing people say about me on the Internet is,  number one, I keep a cell phone in my pants so I can tell friends, call my ass.  He forgot the other rumor. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, what's that?  Oh, there's a couple he forgot.  That he likes to smoke an unlightable cigar.  No Scientology stuff in there.  No, of course not.  No, they're not allowed to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be bad.  A rumor also that he wears the eyepatch in Valkyrie due to a horrible Roman war helmet accident. 
[01:23:30]  And another rumor that he didn't mention was that risky business is what he engages in through a glory hole.  Internet rumor, of course, right, Danny?  Internet rumor.  I think they forgot to mention this one.  Yes.  I have to take a look at a list of his movies there, Danny.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Well, he's had quite a few.  Yeah.  Quite the career that...  He was in Young Guns, you know that, Rain Man.  Yeah.  Cocktail.  Yeah.  Ah, well.  Nuff said.  He was in Cocktail.  They just put out a box set of 25 movies on DVD from Cruise.  Ah, good for him.  25?  Well, that's a little egotistical, don't you think?  It only cost $30.  Well, that's a good bargain. 
[01:24:30]  I hear he's arguing to have it not called a box set.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He wants it called something else.  Every time his friends try to pick it up, they vomit.  He wants it called a fart box set.  No?  It was a double.  Boy.  You were a little too enthusiastic.  Yeah, you raised your hand and everything.  I would say...  I would say...  Oh, God.  If you didn't point at the outfield like Babe Ruth...  Yeah.  ...that might have been a more solid hit.  Oh, dear.  You got that one, Travis?  Yeah, he's got it. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  Oh, he raised his hand and he leaned forward.  He took his tooth on the mic.  This one's for little Johnny in the hospital.  He's going over the fence, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, well, they all have them.  I don't get hot and sweaty too much anymore, but I just did.  All right, it's Friday.  We're going to regroup with the F.U. line, see what people are complaining about. 
[01:25:30]  Fight box set hours.  I heard him, Ralph.  Yeah.  You have no sense of humor.  Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Oh, I want to give a big F.U. to my wife for getting mad at me from F.U. next to her in bed.  Maybe if you've had sex with me more than once a month since you've gotten married,  maybe I wouldn't F.U. so much and ruin our bed and make the bed squeak so you can't fall asleep. 
[01:26:00]  You know what?  I'm going to keep F.U.  And I'm going to keep saying F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to Caroline Kennedy just because you have a famous name.  You think you can run for senator in New York?  You dumb bitch.  You didn't know where Buffalo was until you came to visit it yesterday.  F.U.  F. David Patterson for your tax hikes and F.U.  New York State.  Last one leaving.  Turn out the light.  Next message.  I want to give a big F.U. to everyone who says happy holidays. 
[01:26:30]  It's F.U.  Christmas, so say Merry Christmas.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to our Governor Peterson,  who's going to raise welfare by 30% over the next three years.  Are you a f***ing f***ing moron?  What the hell is wrong with this city?  F*** you.  Next message.  To my stupid neighbor across the street,  who's got $300 to spend on big blow-up stuff that talks Christmas decorations,  but you can't spend $20 on a nice little set of class with horizontal blinds. 
[01:27:00]  Nobody wants to see in your white trash house with your disgusting couches  and a kid hanging off each of all your f***ing.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to say F.U. to the guy who called right before me.  Your F.U. sucked, and I hope he gets tooth cancer.  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  We are moving right along. 
[01:27:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Shoup.  What else is going on today?  Um, there was a list of what teams were almost called.  Oh, really?  Did you see that?  Like sports teams?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I bet there were some inappropriate ones, right?  Not really, no. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, I was thinking.  Oh.  Nashville.  Is that the number one?  I don't think it matters.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Nantucket.  Nantucket.  Um, I don't think that it really, uh.  Gnome.  Matters.  You know, funny, uh, the New York, uh, the New York Skyliners, uh, was a proposed name  for the New York Mets. 
[01:28:30]  Ah, because, uh, the Skyline is.  Right.  They went with the Metropolitans.  Well, uh, before the New York Mets, they started their play in 62, they considered a list  named, uh, the Skyliners, the Skyscrapers, the Bees.  Why?  The New York Bees.  Maybe they're like small breasts.  The Burrows.  The Burrows.  The Continentals.  Hmm.  And the Jets.  But, but, but, but, but, but you can't call the Mets the Jets because the Jets are the 
[01:29:00]  Jets, Jimmy.  Yes.  And you can't call the Mets the Continentals because they don't have first class headrest  things that don't work.  Boring.  Boring.  Be more funny.  This is going great.  This sucks.  I hate you.  I do kind of like the fact that the, uh, Mets are called the Mets because it's short  for the Metropolitans.  So if they were called the Continentals, it could get a little messy. 
[01:29:30]  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Um, Minnesota has one.  Yeah.  The Minnesota Blue Ox.  Oh, babe.  The Blue Ox.  Yeah.  For the Minnesota Wild.  Of course, we're talking NHL here.  Yeah.  And they said that the reason they didn't call them the Minnesota Blue Ox is because Ox  it's subjective. 
[01:30:00]  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Um, Orlando, because they're the Orlando Magic had a name.  Uh, they, they debated the heat before Miami.  Um, the tropics and the juice.  Well, oh, well, Orlando is known as an orange, uh, growing, um, place. 
[01:30:30]  Yes, and there's also a lot of older residents.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was more like juice.  But you mean juice.  Yeah.  The, uh, the Florida Flamingos, uh, they actually considered, uh, naming the Marlins  the Flamingos after, uh, Paul McCartney announced his marriage to Heather Nils.  I'm going by the, off the fly here. 
[01:31:00]  No, they stand on one leg.  We all know that.  They look stupid when they do it.  We're in.  Tucker.  I bother.  This sounds like a morning zoo bit, but these are actual names they were considering for  some of these teams.  The San Antonio Gunslingers, whatever.  Yeah, the Charlottes, the Charlotte Hornets, um.  Almost were called the Spirit.  Yes.  The Charlotte Spirit.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  I like when they say almost.  Like, how close did that come?  Did some, just one douche stand up and suggest it and then get fired? 
[01:31:30]  Like, get no leave.  Boy, it really came close.  It's a suggestion.  Probably a good point.  Well, the Washington Bullets, uh, we all know that.  They didn't want a violent name for their team anymore down in Washington.  Well, I can't mean that, you know, it's fast.  Bullets are fast.  Uh-huh.  Regardless of what they're used for.  Uh, they're fast, so you can't, uh, you can't just say it's because of the speed.  It's violent. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, D.C.  Up.  Well, they almost called them the Washington Sea Dogs before they decided on the Wizards.  But a lot of people had a problem with the Wizards' name because the, you know, the Ku Klux Klan thing.  What?  Yeah.  The Wizards wasn't a perfect choice.  And some fans thought it tied into Ku Klux Klan mythology.  Well, they were going to change their helmets, too.  And then they said that the white little robe things fly off.  Boo.  I should sleep more. 
[01:32:30]  They caused injuries, the pointy helmets.  They didn't make them out of cloth.  They made them out of actual helmet material.  What do those basketball helmets look like?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were talking about a football team.  No.  Okay.  Excuse me one moment.  Thank you.  What do I know?  Did you say, uh, who's just barking?  That was Danny.  Every two seconds, somebody else is releasing gas in here. 
[01:33:00]  I have fantastic gas today.  But do you realize that we both did helmet jokes for a basketball team?  That's the only reason I went with a helmet joke.  I know.  It was because I thought you were talking about a football team.  I know, but I know better.  You pulled me along.  I know.  It's like Obi-Wan Kenobi said.  Yeah.  Who is the bigger fool?  The fool or the, uh, the little, the little man in the robot costume?  The midget in the robot costume? 
[01:33:30]  He's the biggest little fool.  Yes.  With his little midgety body in the equivalent of a rolling garbage can.  Getting a heat stroke inside there.  Good.  Glad they tortured him.  Did he really get a heat stroke?  Oh, yeah.  He was, it was real hot inside that thing, apparently.  They should sit, shut up, shorty.  You're getting a paycheck.  We'll replace you with a dog.  All right, the Baltimore Marauders, the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore for 96. 
[01:34:00]  They couldn't, uh, bring their name.  And, uh, they originally, the original suggested Baltimore Rapists was, uh, struck down as too funny.  It's a snow day here today.  Oh, that logo.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:34:30]  Jesus.  The logo would just be horrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a fist with, like, someone covering her face.  Cowering.  Cowering.  Oh, just a big fist and a black eye.  The jersey's got a picture of a woman curled up in the fetal position in a shower.  Cowering.  I'm just thinking merchandising.  The, uh, the New York Jets were also almost called the, uh, the New York Burroughs.  B-O-R-R-L-S. 
[01:35:00]  Stupid.  Like a play on the word burroughs.  Sure.  Uh, the Gothams got consideration, and they ultimately did not settle on burroughs because  they were afraid that people would be called the squad of jackasses.  Yes.  A burrow.  Yes.  So, I guess they instead decided to, uh, be called the Jets.  J-E-T-S.  Play like jackasses.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  Yeah.  Well, I'm glad, uh, we were able to bring that to the table.  The, uh, the Toronto, uh, Blue Jays.  Oh, Christ, it's not over. 
[01:35:30]  No, no.  The, uh, Toronto Blue Jays were almost called the, uh, the, uh, the Toronto Bunts.  But, uh, they were afraid of the, the rival fans' chants.  Um, which is also why they scratched the, uh, the Toronto knock-chuckers.  And, uh, and, uh, the Milwaukee maggots suffered from a similar fate. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, boy.  sorry  yeah  the opposition  fans could really  get a little rambunctious with the chance  give you a good razin  Los Angeles douchebags  not gone over well  not at all  alright 
[01:36:30]  the Atlanta  hit us with batteries  might taunt  people  I feel like  Tom Cruise  why what are you sitting  on  figured I  would  there we go  nothing wrong

[01:39:00]  than what  he said that  than what  a burned log  what can you feel better than  you certainly don't look  much better than anything  I feel much better  than a slug  in a soul factory  these are obviously  eclipses from  the elephant man  no snow to report on  so  everybody can feel  very kind  not 
[01:39:30]  not  that is what I'm used to  ah  very kind  and what wouldn't be kind  to this guy  for what he was used to  he was wearing a burlap  hat and face mask  and having bricks hurled at him  you'd just  kick him in the face  repeatedly  oh thank you  so much better  than I'm used to  I love the elephant man's  first boss  the guy who kept him  in a cage with hay  and would jab his big  pizza crust source  with a  cane  my treasure  pizza crust  didn't he have

[01:41:30]  because the only reason  I even bothered  to search out  Elephant Man  was because I thought  that Jim's impression  was so funny  that I wanted  to watch it  my kids  that's my favorite  what's better than  I used to  hello  everybody  been so kind

[01:44:00]  anything else  yeah  after the break  yes  check it out  the Opie and Anthony  show for a Friday  kind of having  a snow day today  silly time  yeah  it does feel like  one of those  school snow days  or something  even though  not a  not a  not a  what do you call it  a flake  a flake  I was thinking  a drop of snow 
[01:44:30]  not yet  not a flake  of snow  I was watching  a great show  on that  god damn  North Hollywood  shootout  years ago  oh yeah  the bank robbers  right  yeah  they were  they were  armed to the  to the hilt  oh they had  body armor on  and AK-47s  with giant rotary  clips  and just  hold  they had so much  ammo  and they  outgunned  the LAPD  for a while  just outgunned  them for a while  till SWAT showed up 
[01:45:00]  and the cops  actually had to go  to a local  gun store  to get  guns to compete  against these guys  because they had  their 9mm pistols  and shotguns  but these guys  there's video  of it  it went on  for like 45 minutes  of them  just being shot at  and they get thrown  back a little bit  and then they just  keep walking  they were like  robots  yeah you know  what that was  right  oh what  Grand Theft Auto  it was  yeah  Grand Theft Auto  oh  we've all done 
[01:45:30]  that scenario  with that game  I want to see  how long  I can last  yeah let me see  how long  I got all my  weapons  and flamethrowers  and I got  all sorts of  protection  and then you  you always lose  when you see  the ropes coming  and they're  coming from  they start  rappelling down  on you  from helicopters  like  over Johnny  but it was  pretty much  that same  scenario  you know  it's great  when they  take  because that's  you know  an old story  but these shows  on History Channel  and Discovery  and what not  they update it  with like  computer graphics 
[01:46:00]  so they were  able to show you  some of what  went on  and then they  really get  in depth  by putting  a computer  graphic  of the entire  area  and showing  where the gunmen  were at any  given moment  and the cops  and this line  of fire  and who was  taking cover  where  they give you  so much more  of an in depth  description  of things that  went on  even years ago  now  where they're  able to use  computers  that was about  10 years ago  right  97  were they 
[01:46:30]  walking together  at  yeah  not the whole  time  they were  near each  other  but one  would be  like by  the bank  door  while the  other  one's  on the  corner  they went  behind the  bank  at one  point  they were  just  trying to  kill as  many cops  and civilians  as they could  they were  shooting at  anybody that  they saw  civilians  were getting  shot  there was  one point  where a  bunch of  detectives  and all  they had  were their  9mm  their pistols  and shotguns  so they  couldn't get  close enough  to these guys  to do  any damage  and a bunch 
[01:47:00]  of detectives  lined up  behind this  big cinder block  wall  and just  opened up  on one  of the guys  and the guy  turns around  and fires  his AK-47  which goes  right through  the cinder block  wall  and these  cops are getting  hit by cement  and bullets  and everything  else  another cop  got hit  two of them  got hit in the  leg right through  the femur bone  and they were  sitting there  and you just  hear the 911  calls  they're going  I'm passing  out  you gotta send  some help  and they  were talking 
[01:47:30]  with the 911  dispatchers  saying that  they were  just  freaking out  they were  asking if  this was  the same  officer  down call  they go  is this  one officer  and another  one that  had just  gotten hit  goes no  it's not  one officer  and then  they started  realizing that  this was  you know  multiple  officers  just calling  and going  I'm shot  officer down  needs assistance  they're trying  to drag  themselves away  from certain  situations  other cops  that were  amazing  came up  with their  just their  patrol cars  which  these guns 
[01:48:00]  that they  had  the bullets  were going  right through  them  and were  pulling  some of  these  cops  that were  down  out of  the line  of fire  as they  were being  shot at  you know  those guys  must have  gotten a couple  of medals  was it called  shootout  yeah the show  is called  shootout  on youtube  in four parts  oh youtube  oh cool  yeah you can check it out  on youtube  you can check it out  there but  it's on history channel  what was the final  tally  how many cops  did we lose  no one died  no one  no one died  amazingly  only the suspects  died  yeah  and 15 people 
[01:48:30]  were hit  10 police officers  among the injured  and they expected  to get away with this  okay so they  they robbed the bank  then what  yeah they robbed the bank  eventually  there would be  nowhere to hide  the cops disabled  the escape vehicle  right  the getaway car  they shut out the tires  and everything  and it was still able  to move though  because at one point  one of the guys  gets in  and starts driving  real slow  while the other guy  is using it as cover  and he's shooting up  you know  whatever's moving  and then 
[01:49:00]  then they point out  that one guy  just abandoned  the money bag  and at that  at that moment  they said like  okay these guys  are just in it  now to just kill people  and  they  they nailed  one guy  they were not sure  if they actually  shot him first  through the spine  they got him  and he might have  misfired his gun  when he went to load  his pistol  and shot himself  in the head  or it was a suicide  that he said  you know  this is  I'm done  and just shot himself 
[01:49:30]  in the head  they got all this  on great  helicopter video  oh yeah  and then the other guy  he tried to carjack  a pickup truck  threw all his weapons  in this truck  and then realized  the guy that ran  out of the truck  took his keys with him  so he's kind of  standing there like  ah  so now these cops  come  SWAT team  comes pulling up  to the truck  thinking they're  gonna save  this driver  who's already gone  and now the bad guy  is in the truck  so they don't know  so they pull right up 
[01:50:00]  next to it  and the guy just  opens fire  on the cop car  but he had nowhere to go  yeah  yeah  so the cops got out  took cover behind the car  got low  I think they took  his ankles out  and once he fell  they just started  shooting him up  and I think he died  before the ambulance  even got there  but 45 minutes  of a war zone  there was something  like  at the end of it  300 police officers  responding to these  two guys  if you get a chance  to see it  they really get into it 
[01:50:30]  so it's  it's cool  and they have  actual video  and a few recreations  reenactments  but  the real video  they have a lot of  I remember that  it really was like  something out of a film  I mean  it's amazing  that nobody died  so you can actually  watch it and enjoy it  knowing you're watching  a bunch of cops get killed  just the bad guys  getting it  but the way the cops  talk about it  they talk about it  like they were in a war  the sound of the AK-47s  how loud they are  the fact that  the guns  bullets were going  everywhere 
[01:51:00]  and these guys  you know  no cops  were killed  it's called  shootout  shootout  you find it on YouTube  amazing  so the bank alarm  went off I guess  just they probably  whoopsie  they timed it out wrong  yeah  they certainly did  a couple of  were the guys  yeah  yeah  they were the guys  the one didn't look  that scary  they were a baby face  yeah I know  they were wearing  body armor  that just  made them look  like badasses  they were being hit 
[01:51:30]  you could see  the shots  hitting these guys  and they're still  walking  they had to actually  lean a little forward  because the bullets  were pushing them  backwards  really  yeah  it was insane  it's really a great show  that history channel man  I just  I cannot turn it off  see now they go to  these computer  kind of  graphic  of the whole area  and it gives you  an idea of where  these guys are  what they were doing  at the time  the shotguns were 
[01:52:00]  ineffective  against these  the body armor  these guys had  they had full leg  body armor  what kind of head stuff  do they have  all you could really see  was they were wearing  ski masks  but and you'd think  well placed head shot  I guess it's pretty  difficult when a guy  is rattling off  an AK-47  it's kind of hard  to shoot him in the head  because these guys  had to keep their distance  they couldn't get  really close  to these two  bad guys  is it true  did they say this 
[01:52:30]  in the documentary  or whatever  read from Birmingham  the family of the second guy  sued the police  because they claim  that they didn't call  the ambulance soon enough  the guy laid there  in the street  for like an hour  before it came  they said he died  before the ambulance  arrived  and the family  decided to  saying look  he should have  got the ambulance  there  he should have  gotten an ambulance  there  that's what someone's  saying  I wonder if that's true  also Bruce in Louisiana  has a little  something something  on this  Bruce  morning gentlemen 
[01:53:00]  Merry Christmas  hey man  the thing also said  that they caught  those two guys  they picked them up  a couple of months  before the actual  robbery  in a car  loaded with  guns  ammunition  magazines  high capacity  magazines  couldn't make  any of the charges  stick  so they let them go  they proceeded  to go home  make their own  body armor  sew it together  so there was no  scenes to shoot  between  like you know  police body armor  has you know  the arms  yeah  you can get 
[01:53:30]  through the side  or yeah  things like that  right  sewed their own  body armor  together  so you couldn't  even shoot them  between  like the armpit  which is a weak  spotted police  body armor  they go out  and let them go  and give them  their guns back  wow  were they  registered guns  though  no  yeah  they actually  they had  AK-47s  thousands of  rounds of  ammunition  you know  20 to 30  high capacity  magazines  in the trunk  of this car  but they  couldn't actually  make any 
[01:54:00]  charge  that  I guess  fit what they  were doing  because they  weren't doing  anything  they just  got pulled  over on a  routine stop  or something  searched it  and it's not  actually illegal  to have a gun  in your trunk  yeah  so they had  to actually  give them  all their guns  back and let  them go  if you watch  that shootout  documentary  on a  history channel  I've got it  on my DVR  I love it  cool  it actually  tells that  and uh  they had  I missed  the very beginning  yeah it's  awesome  you know what's  strange 
[01:54:30]  all this for  $30  what  $30  lousy dollars  that was it  huh  yeah  they robbed  the bank  for $30  lousy dollars  $30  unbelievable  to me  yes done  pray  the family  of one  of the guys  did in fact  sue the city  saying that  they let him  bleed to death  in the streets  the first trial  ended in a  mistrial  and then they  agreed to  eventually drop  it  yeah  how does it  end in a  mistrial  I think you just  I think you just  dropped that  cut your losses  you raised a bed 
[01:55:00]  dude  oh it's amazing  alright man  let's go to Boston  Adam how are you  good evening  good evening  Adam  real quick  I don't know  if you noticed  they were talking  about how  these guys were  all jacked up  on meds too  so even if they  took around  they wouldn't  really feel it  feel like the pain  and they wouldn't  bleed quickly  and stuff like  blood thickeners  or whatever it was  they were really  clever  really  they went all out  yeah  because I know  the second guy  that died  he was hit  first  in the ankle  or lower leg 
[01:55:30]  because he was  limping around  for a little while  as he was  shooting  one cop  with a vest  actually jumped  on top of  some of these  detectives  that didn't have  any body armor  and right after  he did that  got shot  three times  in the back  oh my god  yeah  went through  the vest  and  he was  injured  but not killed  wow  after that  he got up  and still  fought these guys  amazing  he said  a lot of  the cops  said  the adrenaline 
[01:56:00]  because a lot  of them  were hit  in the ankles  because they  were using  the cars  a lot of  them were  using cars  as cover  so they were  hitting the  ankles  and the arms  and a lot  of the cops  are saying  from the  adrenaline  they just  kept fighting  they kept  shooting  they didn't  feel any pain  or anything  until later  it's weird  what happens  when you're  in that  situation  I guess  let's go  to Scott  in New York  Scott  did you see  on the  documentary  before they  left for the  bank  they watched  Heat  that big  shootout  scene  oh did they 
[01:56:30]  is that  another thing  yeah I gotta  catch the  beginning of it  I missed the  beginning  when I saw  it was on  I was like  oh yeah  that's the  cop that  gets shot  in the  back  yep  wow  alright  it's called  shootout  it's on  the history  channel  it is creepy  with the  911 calls  they have  all the  real 911 calls  the radio  calls of  these guys  just screaming  for help  after they're  shot  you know  in the  movies  you see  it's like  hey  officer  down  these guys  are screaming  it's worth  a peek  that's for  sure  yeah  you guys 
[01:57:00]  hear about  the plane  the pilot  telling the  passengers  this is a  great story  one of the  better stories  today coming  out  pilot tells  passengers  I'm not  qualified to  land plane  is this a  good thing  or a bad  thing  what  where was  that  what airline  is this  but I'm  asking is it  a good thing  or a bad  thing  because I'm  not really  sure  it's horrible  why  because why  was he even  in the cockpit  he's had  30 years  experience  my friend  he's not 
[01:57:30]  a newbie  he's been  flying for  30 years  was he in  a plane  that he  wasn't  familiar  with  I'm looking  at the  story  as we  speak  here  it was  fog  it was  fog  it was  heavy  fog  we've  all been  on that  flight  where all  of a sudden  they hit  the runway  you're like  wow  how do you  find that  what kind  of training  does that  take  to land  the plane  without  any kind  of visual  whatsoever  measurements  I understand  but  well 20 minutes  outside of  paris  he said  unfortunately  I'm not  qualified  to land  the plane  in paris  they're asking  us for level  two qualification  and I only have  a level five 
[01:58:00]  we have to fly  back  and he had  recently switched  from flying  bombardier  to bombardier  and had not  completed the  requisite  low visibility  training  so apparently  it was probably  a technical  thing  but his company  stood behind  him  they said  he absolutely  did the right  thing  they back  him 100%  because he  took the  safe route  wow  I guess  it's good  in the fact  that he was  honest  you know  it sucks  they were  so close  to landing  he said  I'm not  qualified  and he  turned all  the way  around  and went  all the  way back  to where  he came 
[01:58:30]  from  you know  the way  the headline  sounds  though  it's like  some  Joe the  plumber  is in there  and he's  like hey  by the way  I'm not  qualified  to land  you think  he said  it like  that  or maybe  he said  look I  don't feel  good about  landing  this plane  in this  fog  anybody  want to  come up  here  and give  it a  whack  adage  maybe  he didn't  use  I'm not  qualified  because that  would scare  passengers  saying something  like I don't  think it's a  good idea  they're telling  us to turn  around  that type  of thing  would be  a lot  easier  to handle  qualifications  wow 
[01:59:00]  that's  something  I like  uneventful  flights  I like  when the  pilot  just tells  you  how high  we are  maybe  look out  your window  and see  something  you don't  want things  like  there's a  problem  or that  sound you  just heard  was  they don't  even do  that though  I wish  the pilots  would talk  just a little  more  you never  want to  hear them  go  engine  number  two  right  or just  any engine 
[01:59:30]  you never  want to  hear them  bring up  an engine  I think  there's a  lot of  people that  hate to  fly  and if  that pilot  would just  come on  every once  in a while  and give  you a little  something  something  I think  so many  more people  would enjoy  flying  probably  sleeping  you think  they're  sleeping  in there  they sleep  up there  not both  at the same  time  but what  if the other  one starts  nodding  nodding off  like  effing club  sort of  Kenny does  as you're  driving home  from Boston  it did happen  yeah it did  in LA right  they overflew  LA by like  a half hour  yeah  both pilots  were sleeping  and it's 
[02:00:00]  automatic pilot  whoopsie  they have  kept  going  I demanded  Kenny pull over  once and he  had to admit  yeah I guess  you're right  I guess I  have been  falling asleep  for the last  30 miles  great  isn't that  fantastic  great  thanks Kenny  I was driving  with my brother  once back  down from  upstate  and I'm  looking at him  and I go  you're falling  asleep  let me drive  and he goes  no man  I know  I'm not  going to fall  asleep  I don't  know  you're not 
[02:00:30]  going to  fall asleep  I go  don't you  understand  that's  exactly  what I'm  thinking  right  like  I'm  positive  you're  falling  asleep  so  I  stopped  waking  him  up  because  I  would  wake  him  up  the second  I saw  his eyes  going  but I  waited  I waited  and I looked  to see where we were going  and we hit the rumble strip  but I went  hey  you know what that was  don't you  you were asleep  now pull over  okay  and then I drove  it does suck  I was falling asleep  yeah  I was falling asleep 
[02:01:00]  on the way to Scranton  for a wedding  I had to finally admit it  and go yeah  alright  you drive  I was dead tired  it's such a helpless  feeling  of just  I have no control  over my body  I have this  two ton missile  going down the street  and the brains behind it  is falling asleep  you smack yourself  you roll the window down  you just tried  anything to stay awake  and uh  oof  there's nothing worse  I did the trip  from Buffalo  to Long Island 
[02:01:30]  so many times  and you're just  so tired  you don't want to  stay awake  stay awake  say the words  you just want to  get home  yeah  suffering  doing like you said  everything  smacking your face  opening the windows  even though it's  10 degrees out  cranking the music  you try everything  you'll get used  to anything  at first  you roll the window down  and it's freezing cold  you take a breath  and go  oh man  okay I'm set  there's no way  I'm falling asleep now  yeah  and then like in 5 minutes  oh the cold is so bad 
[02:02:00]  half your face is frozen  right right  you're just dozing off  getting back to the  the plane story  you were saying  you never want to hear  what  engine 2  yeah  listen to this one  Matt in New York  hey boys  hey  happy birthday Jimmy  thank you  I was uh  at a hunt  I was going on my honeymoon  and we're taking off  we get about  10 minutes into the air  and the pilot goes  we have an extreme  hydraulic failure  oh  and considering the plane  runs on hydraulics 
[02:02:30]  yeah yeah  nothing you could do  wow  what kind of plane  were you on  was it small or large  oh it was a large one  it was going to San Juan  from JFK  and we were going  all over the ocean  so he's like  we gotta land in uh  in Philadelphia  and when we  get there  it was just  fire trucks  and ambulances  but a massive hydraulics  failure  you have  I think  two sets of backups  yeah  which I believe  was the flaw  in DC-10s  which caused  that one  uh  United flight  to have such a problem  oh 
[02:03:00]  was that  when there was  an explosion  it severed the lines  of both backups  like something  in the hydraulic  thing blew out  and it severed  the backup lines  too  wow  it was that rear  engine or something  uh  one of the blades  went and  shot through  all of the hydraulic  lines  which they cleverly  put real close  to each other  by the tail section  instead of you know  spreading them out  a little bit  yeah  so it just cut  all three  and oh  no hydraulics  at all  first of all  now hand crank  down the landing gear 
[02:03:30]  and hope for the best  turn the plane  with the engines  I've heard the audio  of those pilots  and they were  you've never  it gave you faith  in airline pilots  these bastards  they were like  uh  yeah  we have  we have no elevator  control  which I guess  means going up  and down  yeah  like I just said  it  yeah  yeah  we have  the 30,000 feet  they can't go  we have no elevator  control  plane turn  I can't  which would be  fine to hear  if they  said something 
[02:04:00]  after that  like  but we  have no problem  you know  they didn't say  that over the  loudspeaker  oh that wasn't  to the people  oh Jesus  no  they said  something happened  but they said  it to the ground  control  oh okay  gotcha  yeah  the people  they said  we've run  out of beverage  right  right  yeah  right  the airplane  has ran  out of beverage  and we mean  the plane  itself  there's no liquid  left  my new thing  is I just  check out  the waitresses  on the flights  is that what you do 
[02:04:30]  and if they're  having no problem  and they're  still trying to  figure out  you know  how to pour  a soda  and get the coffee  right for you  I'm like  alright  we're alright  what about  when they pull  those little seats  down from the walls  and they buckle up  well every time  I feel a bump  I look up  and they're like  reading a book  I'm like okay  they've been through  this  no big deal  yeah when they're  buckled up  yeah  the pilot goes  a little turbulence  but every once in a while  you see them  they'll give you a look  you'll see them  doing a look like  oh boy  yeah  the pilots never even  say turbulence anymore  bumps 
[02:05:00]  yeah it's going to  get a little bumpy  a little bumpy  a little choppy  a little bumpy  for a short period of time  we're going to keep  the seatbelt light on  and well the second  we get into some clear air  we're going to take  that light off  and then you're thinking  oh okay  we're going to get out of it  and we're going to  take the light off  were you ever on a flight  where the plane went sideways  or it felt like it went  sideways for a few seconds  in a small  turbo prop  I was coming home  from LA  no big  big one  big plane 
[02:05:30]  big one  really  and it was so bad  that everybody  including yes  myself  started screaming  and I went  this is it  something hit the plane  wind shear  whatever  I don't know  it was on our way  back into New York  we're getting close  and it felt like  it was sideways  like  like I was  leaning  heavy right  heavy right  for a second or two  and everyone  started screaming  were they making  like a little bit  of a bank turn  and then the wind 
[02:06:00]  hit it  and really  it came  a little bit  Jimmy  it came out of nowhere  it was like  normal normal normal  all sudden  this feeling of  wow  we got hit  it felt like  we got hit  by something  it was the only way  I could describe it  and everyone  started screaming  everybody  fun one  yeah  and just grabbing  as hard as you can  and then  it was  I don't  I don't even know  this is years now  but a couple seconds  and then it was back  to like whatever  and it landed  with no incident  you'd be amazed  the pilot never said  anything  the waitresses 
[02:06:30]  up there  they were screaming  you ever see  a slow motion  shot of like  a 747  in a test chamber  for what the  yeah I understand  what they could do  yeah  the wing tips  that makes you feel  a little better  are moving  like a bird  the wings are  flapping  they're moving  so far  up and down  because sometimes  you look out  that window  and you see  the wings  and they're moving  yeah  and you're like  that's made of metal  yeah  is that supposed  to do that  how does it not break  I know when I take  a piece of metal  and I bend it 
[02:07:00]  enough times  it gets hot  and then it breaks  it's like  how many times  has that wing  done that  good point  it's almost 90 degrees  before they snap  though  yeah yeah  so it's never  going to happen  in flight  yeah  it's not like  people think  it's two wings  on a plane  it's like one structure  that goes right  through the plane  yeah  is the wing  to this day  I don't know  what that flight  was all about  what happened  to the plane  I have no idea  yeah you probably  hit one of those  weird air pockets  or just went  like  yeah  like sliding  on a slippery highway 
[02:07:30]  for a split second  I don't know  it was weird man  the thing is  if you're flying  if your plane is flying  doing let's say  you know  500 miles an hour  and the wind is  pretty wacky  up high  and then you get  a tailwind  that whips in  at 100 miles an hour  this gust  it takes 400 miles  then you're only  really doing  a 400 mile an hour  air speed  so  you might drop  a little bit  so maybe that's what it was 
[02:08:00]  the throttle down  I don't know  it was  so relative  to the wind  you know  that's why  it's air speed  not ground speed  if you got a headwind  you know  you barely got to  give it any  any juice  you're rocking  we love hearing that  right  oh good news  we got a headwind  well the tailwinds  are good for getting  I mean tailwind  tailwind  the headwinds  will keep your plane up  without any effort  yeah  I got you  your relative air speed  will be pretty fast  yeah I meant the tailwind  but you won't be going that fast  we're going to make up  a lot of time  we got a tailwind 
[02:08:30]  yeah  how about you make up time  anyway  yeah  just do it even if we're not late  and let's get there early  got it  there you go  yeah  goose this thing  oh I got the phones  ringing  we'll do a little mop up next  Opie and Anthony  stay there  getting ready to get out of here  for the weekend  at least this side  of the Opie and Anthony show  got a good phone call  coming in from Alan  in Dallas  Alan how are you buddy  good morning  just want to say  for the record  no naked girls 
[02:09:00]  in the studio  but we can advertise  Trojan condoms  on the radio  that's great  right  I'm so glad  you guys are noticing  because if we notice  that stuff  we get in trouble  yeah  my god  what's up Alan  anyway maybe you get  some naked girls  they sell more Trojan condoms  I don't know  Mythbusters did an episode  on whether  a non-experienced person  could be talked down  by a pilot  over the radio  in air traffic control  probably one of the  coolest episodes  of Mythbusters  I've ever seen  I gotta go see 
[02:09:30]  that Mythbusters  I would love to see that  what was the  verdict  Adam and Jamie  both went in  with a flight plan  with nobody  to talk them down  promptly crashed  the plane  in NASA's  multi-million dollar  flight simulator  then they get a guy  that's like  a 30 year pilot  gets on the radio  yeah you're gonna  notice the landing gear  switch to your right  go ahead and flip that  pull your elevator back  slow your speed  perfect landing  both times  so they 
[02:10:00]  completely called it  plausible  because there was  no confirmed cases  ever in history  of anybody  being talked down  remotely  by air traffic control  but they both  did it on the simulator  back to back  our resident expert  on Mythbusters  Danny  that is true  they both were able  to be talked down  and land the plane  safely  however  they also mentioned  that it would never  happen in a real world  environment  because the planes  these days  are so sophisticated  and just packed 
[02:10:30]  with the latest  technology  that when you flip  on autopilot  that plane  could fly itself  and even land itself  if it needed to  so you would never  be in a situation  where you actually  needed to be  talked down  to land the airplane  yeah  you would have to  somebody would have  to tell you  what  you know  switches to  hit  for the autopilots  and the  you know  ILS  and whatever else  you would need  to line up  with the runway  but  yeah  what are you going 
[02:11:00]  to do  it's going to  bring you right in  that's good to know  alright Alan  thank you  anyway  see Jimmy  at the Borgata  on the 18th  tickets go on sale  at 10 o'clock  morning  how good are you  third show by the way  nice Alan  thank you  we got more  plane stories  coming in  I think we kind of  got to get out of here  though  want to take one more  of these  sure  flight I was on  felt like roller coaster  flight was delayed  after truck hit our  plane on runway  let's go with that one  yeah  Janice  hi guys 
[02:11:30]  how are you  good  what are you doing  I just pulled into work  I wanted to tell you  what happened to me  I was on a commuter jet  from London to Glasgow  and our plane was hit  by the catering truck  on the runway  yummy  how bad  apparently not so bad  that we couldn't take off  but you saw the guys  come up in their little  cherry picker  with their toolbox  and stuff  and kind of fiddled around  for a few minutes  and padded the plane  on the side  like everything was  going to be okay  and they told us  we could go  it's not like

[02:21:00]  until today  didn't we try that  like 10 years ago  headphones  you don't have  headphones  headphones please  um somebody  headphones  yeah I'd need  headphones  head  oh we'll just sit  around and wait  until someone  that works here  um  brings me some  headphones

[02:22:00]  that knew that you  didn't have headphones  and totally forgot  to give them to you  E-Rock  you're a douchebag  E-Rock what do you have  to say about that  that's stupid  well whoever's  supposed to set up  the studio over here  with aunt's toys  should have put  the headphones in as well  oh  well there's no toys  or anything  I don't have my toys  yeah this is um  something we've talked  about about a thousand times  why isn't the studio  who's supposed to set up  why is someone random  every day  why don't we have an intern  well we did get in  a little early  today  oh that's right 
[02:22:30]  we didn't  well we ended late  where Rock lives  so  yes  when you find out  that Rock lives  you gotta stick around  and see who Rock is  oh would you like  yeah  you got all your  whistles and  oh yeah  all my bells and whistles  as they call them  yeah  we've been meeting  and chit-chatting  while you were on  your way over  about Tom  pick the god damn  pen up Kenny  it's um  um  um 
[02:23:00]  why are you writing  notes to Jimmy  in the middle of  what he was trying  to say  it was  do I want to eat  is that what he wrote  why couldn't he just say  you want to eat  he wrote  E-A-T  question mark  Jimmy's in the middle  of talking  I honestly don't  remember what I was saying  I know  because of Kenny  me and Anthony  before the show  were talking about  eat  um  um  it was uh 
[02:23:30]  Lewis Twitchell Santani  yeah  what we want to see  is because Lewis  does um  what happened  what happened  with you and Lewis  there was an incident  you guys had  where he was crying  or upset  yes  at the first time  random thought  I'm sorry  I'm just kidding  people listening to that  and uh  we want to hear him  do his fucking  uh  his awful  uh  impression of uh  uh  cowardly  cowardly lying 
[02:24:00]  let me tell you something  that impression  that he does  could be  could be  well that  or  the most embarrassing  thing I've ever seen  live  and heard  when he does it  what's wrong with it  we got it  I wanna  I wanna  put him out of his misery  do we have it to play  for everybody  I hope so  I wanna see it  yeah I know  I was looking for it  on uh  YouTube  but Sam had let me know  that uh  he had actually  two YouTube  uh  usernames  and like the first one  kinda got nuked  so he had to start 
[02:24:30]  from scratch  so that whole  yeah so that  that Twitchell's uh  doing the impression  video might have been  under that one  cause I can't seem  to find it  on YouTube  but we can get the audio  cause I know we still have that  oh dear  we'll get it  I hope so  oh damn  what's um  silly me  damn it I wanted to hear that  do we have the audio anyway  it was so awful  yeah we'll get it  we'll find it right now  it's so  when he did it  it's this feeling  again that embarrassing  feeling  when he's going  oh  and he makes the face 
[02:25:00]  and he does the  like the jump  like you'll go  hey cause you're with  some girls in  and we're like  he does the  the impression  and they're like  oh let's see it  he goes  oh  oh  oh  that was it  the bottomers  that was  that was close enough  and it wasn't even close  but it was close enough  where I got goose bumpy  cause I was embarrassed  it was fucking horrible  what are you doing  well now we need to hear it  I know  so bad 
[02:25:30]  we would play it right here now  yeah but we don't have it  that's okay  Sam  we would play it right here now  Sam what made you put your hair up like that  because it was too much  it was all around the sides of my face and stuff  is it really getting out of hand now  yeah  like I do this at home a lot  but I didn't have the guts to do it here  you do what?  home a lot?  no  I wear my hair like this at home  a lot  oh  oh you better  yeah  pause between those two words  that's great  what does the girl think of that  she likes it 
[02:26:00]  cause she says she likes to see my face  cause she thinks I'm handsome  oh  it's cool  and I can't pull it back in a regular ponytail  because my hair snaps  yeah  back  it looks like  you have your hair cut  and then there's some big  fucking mess of pubes  stuck on the back of your head  it's my hair  hold on let me ask you  was it uncomfortable for you  when you first did that  fucking awful Chicago Project hair  do you have  I just don't want it in my face  and this is my only 
[02:26:30]  yeah  you know you're gonna officially lose Afro Wars  why?  it's near the end  if you're starting to do that with your hair  no I can just leave it like this  nah you're losing it  you're losing it buddy  why don't you cut it  because I'm gonna win this Afro Wars competition  that everybody's wrapped up in  like a clown  that ended a year ago  who won?  who's wrapped up in anything  you guys went almost a whole year  without a haircut right?  over a year  actually I think right now  it's over a year  over a year  cause I know I think  I had a couple months worth of growth  before we decided  that we were gonna do this 
[02:27:00]  in the first place  yeah we started in like December  but I think  neither Danny or I  right that's true  everyone  god old hash  it really is  it's October 2007  since I cut my hair  yeah  can you believe it?  I can't  I can't  what was the motivation behind Afro?  I don't even remember what started that shit  it was just a goof contest  that we never finished  a really dopey thing  what motivated you to keep going with it?  cause I didn't want to lose  why?  I don't like giving up bits  so what are you gonna do?  just let it keep growing  he's never gonna cut his hair 
[02:27:30]  you know that  yes he will  and you're gonna have one of those  like O.J. Simpson Afros  eventually  I'll have to start braiding it  my sister asked me to  she's getting married in like September  and she asked me if I would cut it  yeah  and I said no  this is my career  yeah  so maybe I'll have to braid it  I remember when it started  cause you said to Danny  what's the matter?  are you chicken?  yeah  and Danny can't take that  he freaks out  says chicken  nobody  right  nobody calls me chicken 
[02:28:00]  apparently  but I'm winning this thing  so far I'm in the lead  no you're not in the lead  yes I am  I have much better afro hair  than you do  hey Patty  what are you babbling about  that we can hear?

[02:42:00]  what are you studying  um  biotechnology  dude what is wrong  with you by the way  see  she didn't look  as hot on the bleachers  I'll be completely honest  but then you bring her in  and you see the full package  you're too young  you're too young  to be tied out of this  are you kidding me  him  yeah what's the complicated thing  there's more going on  than just that  don't go by facebook status  yeah just go  it's drama that's being created  what's the whole thing  there's no reason to be comp 
[02:42:30]  this is a winner right here  yes  I'm invested  I'll say that  you young guys have no fucking idea what happens  you're gonna be dreaming of this girl for years after she dumps you  I'm here with her aren't I  I mean jeez  you guys  right now  you should tie that shit up  right Jimmy  I do tie that shit up  I love seeing the young guys around Manhattan with the really hot chicks  and they have no idea what they got  exactly  they have no fucking idea what they got  exactly  and those very sexy boots  yeah  stormtrooping all over the end 
[02:43:00]  uh  I don't say  oh  I was gonna say  no no no  here's what happened  I was gonna say empire  but it started to come at enterprise  you put those two together  you have a bomb  yeah  you have some fairy boots on too Lily  I certainly do  what do you think of Lily  uh Russian chick  Agatha  she's adorable  and you've never kissed a girl before  no  Lily what do you think of her  I think she's  probably gonna be the hottest girl I kissed 
[02:43:30]  so far  and she's  she's kissed a penthouse pet  yeah  yeah  I can't believe I read  and kissed Maria from the WWE  and she's uh  pretty good to look at  it's her Russian accent too  you like the Russian accent  she's a little Eastern European  yeah  Chris C from Virginia  is a little worried  alright  this Lily is the quiet hetero  before the gay storm  that you guys do  we forget that  before all that gay shit yesterday  we did have a nice lesbian kiss 
[02:44:00]  and some pussy cupping  and pussy uh cupping  that's right  would you be up for a pussy cup  what  I'm wearing leggings today  you get to like  you get to cup her pussy  yeah  Jimmy will show you  how to do it  I will  but not to be dirty  I'll demonstrate  simply because  because we like  things done properly  as a show member  I feel it's my duty  to instruct the audience  on how to as we say  uh  cup  cupple pussy  he has a precision of a surgeon  when it comes to cupping 
[02:44:30]  oh apostrophe  alright  Lily's  cup  Lily sit on the table  so Jimmy can cup your pussy  this is Lily  hold on  will those  silly uh  stupid autographed albums  out of the way  you don't care about those  gotta say  Ron and Fez crazy  for getting rid of  uh  the Lily  right  right Sam  I have to go on the right side  okay  I gotta say  it's a damn good gig  Jimmy what's going on over there  Jimmy you sure you want to do this one  only if Lily is completely comfortable 
[02:45:00]  but you sure you want to do this one  I don't know  I'm here  leggings and stuff  you know  I'm  not only do I want to do it  but I think that uh  Danny and Sam  they're all like  everyone but Steve  I'm just kidding Steve  Jimmy make her  her toes curl  um  be gentle Jimmy  I'm always gentle  I don't  I'm not a rough pussy cupper  I cup gently  and these pants are on by the way  are we shocking the bleachers  you guys are very silent  you're about to see a pussy cup  yeah  by the great Jim Norton  you motherfuckers  act like you ain't have a cup of pussy 
[02:45:30]  how about some energy for this Friday  now  you have to take  your hands like this  now I'm putting them in the um  my thumb is out  and how would you describe this  you're better describing  like how you work a sock puppet  yeah  excellent Danny  definitely  and depending on the age of the person  you might have to make the plane sound  and then uh  you you you scoop  excuse me  man this is  this isn't for  do you think  this is not  please what do you think 
[02:46:00]  I'm doing this for a jerk off fodder  for the next two years  I think you're enjoying it  no  um  and you have to put your hand  under under where the behind he is  and you just kind of gently  and then you  cup  see I'm not even touching her vagina  I'm touching all pants  and then you cup the pussy  cup  now was that not respectful  that was very appropriate  I didn't even touch her badge  well you're wearing them  fucking big old leggings  hanging down like fucking  yeah  like Jay-Z  you should pull them way up  wait Lily  you were disappointed by the uh  the pussy cup  it was uh very brief 
[02:46:30]  it was brief  because what Lily did was this  she's wearing  you know how leggings are  we've all worn them  and when they hang down  one more time  one more time  one more time  I gotta be honest  she actually pulled them up  like William Frawley  and it's the only time  that would ever turn me on  is the fact that  now her badge is more accessible  alright  can you see the badge  through there  would you care to come watch  come watch  if I move Sam  yeah bring Aggie  thank you  over here  come here Aggie  come on Aggie  alright  alright  okay 
[02:47:00]  now you cup  hi  Lily and I have never fooled around  honestly this is the most we've ever done  you put your hand like that  you kind of go near the bottom  of the hiney  and with your uh  you kind of cup like that  and you allow  your thumb kind of goes  over the pubic area  and it's this part  where your uh  your pointer finger  and your thumb kind of meet  that kind of  touch the vagina  like that  and then you move it around a little bit  and you stop  see that was nice right  yeah  not bad  yeah  and the point  the point  fun for all who watch  fun for all 
[02:47:30]  trust me you'll see the point  when you do it  yeah the pants are on  so why is it complicated  with the Facebook dude  cause I'm in Buffalo  that's where I go to school  you're in Buffalo  dude why aren't you moving to Buffalo  cause he wants to be here with you guys  oh really  she said why'd you leave Buffalo  that's a good point  that's a good point  she's like a 50 in Buffalo  yeah  yeah  wow  how about this  would you with Lily  would you  would you peck Lily  you don't have to start French 
[02:48:00]  would you start with a peck maybe  since you never did it  cause she's a pretty  very clean girl  she's a nice girl  that's our bit called  kiss Lily  look at her  wanting  needing  she's a sweetheart  she's a good girl  yeah  why do you guys do that  like that  not like you know  the guys  kissing the girls  because then we never did it  yesterday  and we did a lot of that  yesterday  she doesn't want to kiss the guys  the girl girl stuff is hot  Sam was deep throat  and cock all day long  yesterday  I'm all kissed out  yeah  Agatha 
[02:48:30]  it's to you  does he approve  how do you approve  of lesbianism sir  um  erock  just close the door  hey erock  hold on  I see something going on  what happened  you don't like that dude  no  what bothers you  everybody hates him  why  why  he's just annoying  why is he annoying  alright  one  if any of us were single  what  what  what did he say  because I have talent 
[02:49:00]  on the radio  oh  snap  holy shit  ooh  nice  no  faggot  listen  any one of us  we're all talking about  he's fucking annoying  hold on hold on now  he's mad because he called  him a faggot  you gotta do  you gotta get up  hold on  bring  erock you got a cordless mic  at least you guys can talk  so you can look at each other  yeah  alright  what's up sir  well  I don't know if I  um  well  I have a couple  discrepancies with erock's  assessment of me  do you  what is he 
[02:49:30]  go ahead  I guess  I don't know  because I lack  breast fat  I guess that makes me  oh  oh  oh  no  holy shit  holy shit  I gotta come to  erock's looking down now  as if he's ashamed  by something  well I'm not ashamed  dude  I'm just  amazingly  um  I guess disappointed  but  look what you have here  and you can't commit  to this  good point  what is the  what's the hold back 
[02:50:00]  on this  you're a single dude right  well that seems to be  the issue  no it's a yes or no answer  are you single or no  you're seeing somebody else  no I'm dating  Agatha  you're dating somebody else  no Agatha  Agatha  the other Agatha  dummy  oh  shut the fuck up  you homo  you come up  and you don't even look at me  and you close the door on me  yeah cause you're ruining  the fucking bit  no  wow  she asked do I have approval  and I shut my mouth  she doesn't have to ask your approval 
[02:50:30]  you're not dating her  she decided to  that's the thing about a relationship  where you don't all of a sudden  you just said you're not invested in her  how is that a relationship  I said I am invested in her  but we're not  you're the friend that she talks to  and confides in  are you making up a fantasy for yourself  no  that's totally not the story  that's going on here  no  you're just a freebound friend  that she just leans on  while I all of a sudden  that's how you're acting  not her  while she talks about  how crappy you are  you're  you're  you're  just met her  slow down  okay  how am I trying to  break this chick  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[02:51:00]  oh  Lily's comforting  just know  Agato  they're now  Mr. Agato  I completely figured her out  just now by the way  you did  yeah she's got  she's one of those girls  who's like incredibly gorgeous  but has zero self-esteem  because when Lily was talking about  that she would be the prettiest person  that she kissed  she just said  she was  she's like  oh I can't believe I even rank  and then the fact that she puts up with him  not being able to commit  like he's kind of on the fence 
[02:51:30]  about wanting to be with her  but she's still looking to him for approval  that just cements the fact that  she thinks that she's lucky to have him  meanwhile it should really be the other way around  Dr. Danny  yes  that's completely it  are you  are you sticking up for E-Rock Danny?  absolutely  wow  if uh  wow look at that  you know  this guy could shit on uh  you know  Eric's radio performance all he wants  but who has  who has  who has a  who has a paying gig in radio  and who doesn't  who's looking  who's looking to be an intern next semester  wow  well  you know I'd probably agree with your assessment  just because you didn't come off 
[02:52:00]  and shut a door in my face  I can take this  I would have  if it wasn't Eric  I just don't like that  somebody was going to do  believe me  if I was  if I was scouring that part of the room  I think they hate you  because you're with  everyone hates  no it's not the fact that he's  I just like Danny  I mean Danny's actually really talented  and I think he's really  oh there you go  thank you  but the point is  is that when  when we're trying to  when we're trying to get a girl on girl kiss happening  you don't need to chime in  with your little show references  every 20 seconds  to get your  you know  to be funny  and try to score points  try to score points with the boys  you know what I mean 
[02:52:30]  that's all  what's wrong Steve  this is getting too interesting  we gotta shut it down  that's exactly it  no I was just asking somebody  if you wanted me to hold the mic  alright very good  oh boy Steve  love it  alright so now what  is everyone upset now  are we in a bad place  where'd erock go  I don't know  what happened  erock now left  where's the nagel  we need you  where's the nagel  we need you  now where are you going  are you guys done  I don't want you to stop  I'm not trying to interfere with the bit 
[02:53:00]  I wanted to proceed  and everyone to have a good time here  why don't you guys make up  so we can move on with the bit  I just didn't like the fact  that he spoke harshly to Eric  and Eric spoke harshly to him  yeah  what's going on  that's not what this is about  you wanna hug him  you wanna hug it out  go hug each other  yeah you guys hug it out  yes it does  cause we gotta get  I said of course he does  there we go  erock  alright so now we're okay  we're set for the lesbian kiss  of course he does  I want to  I want you to intern now  by the way  I really do  oh my god

[03:11:00]  bearer of bad improv  oh my god  what was he  the worst  yes Jim  how many are there  yes  now I would love  to know  when is yes  an improv  never  Steve  what rule  are we breaking  like what rule  in society  oh society  society  let's say we take  this part of it out  what rule  are we breaking  that we could 
[03:11:30]  get in trouble for  the company  can get in trouble  for what  on satellite  fucking radio  I have no idea  why don't you ask  that question  I have no idea  all I know is  there seems to be  a large difference  in what society  deems appropriate  what corporations  deem appropriate  now  ask them  we take that  out of the mix  right there  we take the old  oh that wasn't even  I already said that  that was  okay so  this technically  is out of the mix  trust me  it's just the fact  that that's going  where it's going  that's the part  and that's the part  that's the problem  absolutely  that was brought up 
[03:12:00]  immediately  now  why  how about  a fucking reason  instead of just  telling us  not you  I'm not talking about you  I know  I want one of the  corporate guys  to tell us  why  what's the reason  for  saying no to a girl  that wants to put  something up  herself  her dumper  herself  she wants to put  anal beads  it's one of those  because we said so  reasons  no I want a  fucking reason  I'm done with it  we said so reasons 
[03:12:30]  I'm done with those  I know the reason  they'll give you  done with those  when I was a kid  here's the reason  they'll give you  like in 1860  and I'm only going  by what I know  that lawyers  they will give you  this reason  if she is injured  or injured  again I'm not saying  I agree  but this is what  they will say  they will say  if she hurts herself  putting something  inside of herself  because she's on  the show  and here we are  liable  that's what  you know  somebody could  trip and  fucking crack  their head  on the edge  of that  fucking  platform  or the  console  I agree  or whatever 
[03:13:00]  oh  I agree  god  someone could  be bored  to death  by Steve's  improv  I disagree  go ahead  Steve  sorry  all I was  going to do  is I will  make as many  calls as you  want me to  make  on this one  no make the  call right now  in the studio  call them  and ask  why  I want to  know why  I don't just  want to be told  anymore  that we can't  do something  I want a reason  we'll wait  hi this is Steve  I'm wearing

[03:14:30]  really  no  no  they  don't  since  when  since  apparently  the dawn  of time  oh really  yeah  really  isn't there a  machine on  Howard's show  that girls  sit on  and there's a  fucking dildo  on the seat  it won't be  it won't be  inserted  if she was  if one of these  young ladies  was gliding  on a device  and not  inserting it  that's acceptable  yep  boring  now if he's  listening  what  what  who gives a 
[03:15:00]  shit  if he's  listening  he's trying  to find out  exactly what  I'm saying  on the air  you're not  on the air  you're in  the background  you're  you're crazy  the radio's  talking to you  jump out  the window  jump out  the window  I'm the radio  put foil  on your head  so you can't  hear me  or shoot  yourself  how you doing  there young  what if she's  on top of  something  guy girl  that is the 
[03:15:30]  most androgynous  fucking thing  since it's  pat  if we take  the anal beads  and then  like we open  a butt a little  bit  ask that  if we take  the anal beads  and we play  operation  and try not  to touch  the sides  what  why  he's had  enough  he's furious  and he's  had enough  why is he  furious  we're trying  to fucking  do good  radio for  the subscribers  why is he 
[03:16:00]  furious  we're trying  to fucking  figure this  out  this is a  discussion  I'm probably  going to have  for the rest  of the fucking  day  who gives a  shit  I know you  don't give a  shit  I'm very well  aware  oh well  so there's  no um  no insertion  no insertion  especially with  that big  vibrating  mechanical tone  doesn't want  to discuss  it anymore  that's annoying  as shit  that's good  that's a nice  like fucking  daddy answer  I don't want 
[03:16:30]  to talk about it  that was I  saying that  that was I  though  kind of a  thing  that's nice  you're right  pat you want  to wet your  pants  how much  money we got  let's go home  that way  want to make  wee-wees  yeah but you're  a little closer  to the studio  I'll throw  a 40 in  if I can see  a wet spot  in the front  of your jeans  I got 40  there it is  all I have to  do is pee  your pants  pee your pants  dude does that  slide over a  dick  is that supposed  to be a dick  extension 
[03:17:00]  no it's  it's horrible  I guess what  they did is  they took like  a regular  plastic vibrator  and just kind  of like rolled  a latex cock  over it  so you could  actually roll  the cock part  off and just  have the actual  vibe  fascinating  what'll they  think of next  how great  would it be  to just stand  in the park  and eat ice cream  out of that  out of the  hollowed out  rubber cock head  just eat an ice cream  cone look at kids  and yell  go home  let's go to  Joe on  Wag Peg  Joe 
[03:17:30]  hey  do it a bit  we don't care  if we get fired  at this point  just do it  we don't care  listen to this guy  we don't care  we don't care  do it a bit  for it off  do it a bit  I don't understand  why he would  hang up on you  that pisses me off  more than anything  we're trying to  fucking figure out  that there's  something we can  do here  Jim the trucker  hey guys  hey  I wanted to know  if Howard did  this same shit  and I would like  to know why  these bullshit 
[03:18:00]  cowards  that tell you guys  you can't do shit  don't just go and  call you guys  why they gotta go  through Steve  and make him look  like an asshole  all the time  Steve does that  naturally  no disrespect  but they really  can't call us  on the air  Steve's job  is to deal  with them  and Steve  called  and they were  calling him  yeah  it's just  more lawyer crap  thinking of  every possible  thing that could  go wrong  in the process  ruining shit  that we could  be doing  that's alright 
[03:18:30]  because it's  everybody that's  scrambling  in this day and age  to hope  they have another  day to go  into work  keep their jobs  so they keep  the status quo  and meanwhile  the people that  will lose their  jobs are the  people that are  not getting  the listeners  and those are  the people that  are on the air  trying to do  things that the  suits that keep  their jobs  are telling us  we can't do  let's go to  Dave in New  Orleans  Dave  hey  hey  I know why 
[03:19:00]  they don't want  to do it  and Steve  don't want to  follow up on this  why  because they're  my anal beads  and I don't want  her stinking ass  around them  oh  I get it  Steve is saying  they're his  anal beads  didn't you assume  at one point  in time  that a talk show  on satellite radio  was going to be  the wildest  fucking thing  like the wild west  uncensored  completely fucking  out of control  I mean  out of control 
[03:19:30]  radio  where people  would tune in  and go  now this  is what  a free  and open  talk show  environment  entertainment  variety show  is about  it's about  people coming in  and just doing  whatever the  fuck they want  without inciting  a riot  or doing anything  criminal  things like that  obviously a  criminal act  is something  we cannot do  on any  type of  broadcasting  facility  but  I assumed  satellite  was  no holds  barred 
[03:20:00]  whatever you  want to do  and then as  time goes on  you just  realize  it's the  same  bunch of  fucking  dick  bags  that are  just running  running  things  it's  infuriating  call him  call him back  and ask him  why I hung up  on you  do a podcast  for ten people  shove shit  in my own ass  tune in  this Saturday  night  what am I  going to do  I hate  corporate people  I just can't  stand them  there's such a  backlash against 
[03:20:30]  them  they're ruining  the economy  they ruin  entertainment  they ruin fun  lawyers ruin  everything  they steal  people's money  they lowball  you  you fuck  in the ass  take anal  beads away  from you  let's say  hi to Eric  in Canada  oh  Canada  nice  I'm paying  15 bucks  a month  I want to  fucking hear  anal beads  I'm pissed  this bit  would rule 
[03:21:00]  can you make her  do one girl  one cup  dude  let me  the list  that's nice  the list of  bits that are  being taken  away from us  on satellite radio  is just  at this point  mind boggling  dude it's  everything  we've come up  with  eggnog  drinking challenge  homeless shopping  spree we could  do if we get  the mall's  permission  how the fuck  does that work  that's why we  get on the air  every day  and we talk  it's a talk show  the Opie and Anthony  show was more  of a talk  variety show  kind of a thing 
[03:21:30]  we would have  activities  things  benchmarks  it has turned  into a pure  let's sit  and discuss  stuff all day  because every  single bit  we bring up  we are not  allowed to do  anymore  except unless  it's something  we can't even  think of  because it's  so inane  boring  and milquetoast  I'm sure  we'd be able  to get away  with something  that's wacky  and zany  that they do  on regular  fucking radio  but you know  as far as  doing things  like the  wiffle ball  bat challenge 
[03:22:00]  when we used  to do that  things  I mean  it's all  the eggnog  drinking challenge  was nothing  it was nothing  nothing to do  with people  drinking water  until they  drop dead  the guy  that runs  the challenge  now not  picking up  correct  that's how  we have to  um  goodbye  deal with  things now  oh  oh  there goes  the headphones  goodbye  wow  you're getting  the slow  clap  I'll think 
[03:22:30]  about it  if I want  to come  back  oh  there goes  the mic  watch out  the chimney  fuck you  fuck you  fuck you  fuck you  chimney cricket  I am so  put your  put your  goddamn shirt  on Patty  you look like  shit  I know  stop trying  to sexy  it up  yeah  I'm gonna  sexy up  this situation  none  yeah the fact  that um  the fact that  we can't get  in touch  with the  gentleman  we would  like to  speak to  about the 
[03:23:00]  actual  bit  lemons into  lemonade  I am right  now looking  at Lily's  hiney  and she  pushed the  mic back  in and I  have to  say  um  I wish I  wasn't  chewing food  really  yeah  I don't  know why  that would  matter  I wouldn't  touch it  but  does she  have uh  let me see  turn  turn  I've never  really gazed  upon uh  you don't have  a normal like  Asian girl  ass  have you heard  that before  I've definitely  heard that  yeah  before  I've never  really  I've never  really  fake or 
[03:23:30]  anything  fake  those built  in butt  cheeks  in your  underwear  Jim can  feel it  to make  sure  they're  real  Jim can  um  in  in the  best interest  of the  audience  and the  show  yes  Jim  um  I will  do it  normally  I wouldn't  um  yes I  would  all right  give it a  little feel  make sure  it's  see if  it's  uh  firm  feel for  any  um  dimples  I'm cupping  the left  cheek right  now  yeah  and now  I'm cupping  the right 
[03:24:00]  one  and I  have  to  say  it is  fucking  mind-bogglingly  nice  really  nice  firm  yeah  she's a  sexy  person  yeah  very sexy  she's nuts  yeah  yeah  nutty  as a  fruitcake  but uh  sexy  and  on the  radio  what happens  with you  with relationships  do guys  just tell you  like you're  too fucking  crazy  and just  ditch you  or something  no  I'm not  like this  off air  no but you  know in order  to be like  this on air  there has to  be a problem 
[03:24:30]  off air  believe me I  know I've  been doing  this enough  years  I'm fucking  insane  nobody who's  interesting on  the air  has a healthy  life  right  there's  something  wrong  yeah  what's the  problem  with your  relationships  where do  they go  wrong  because you're  an attractive  girl  I mean  what  what  what's  the problem  I don't  know maybe  it's  a lack  of attention  from my  parents  oh what 
[03:25:00]  more traditional  Asian parents  they're not  traditional  in that  like they'll  were they born  over there  yeah so  was I  I came here  when I was  seven  China  China  you were in  China until  you were seven  years old  I was born a  communist  yeah  did they bind  your little feet  no my feet  are quite large  from my height  well they should  have bound the  shit out of  those things  I love that  look a foot  like an accordion  it's a great  look  fucking lunatics  are you more  dominant or  submissive sexually 
[03:25:30]  I can't really  tell with you  I think I'm  both I mean  as exemplified  by the cuckold  Sam thing  yesterday  I can play  I like it  when it's  aggressive  but it's  not a matter  of being  only submissive  it depends  on the context  yeah  that was  very impressive  yesterday  her cuckolding  of Sam  yeah yeah  yeah  was very sexy  thank you  so now  have you had  a steady  boyfriend  yeah  and what  what happened  there  um 
[03:26:00]  well one  was because  we both  went to  separate  colleges  that's like  a movie  yeah  yeah  and then  the other  one was  because  he was  kind of  gay  yeah  exactly  no way  I'm so  serious  oh really  you went out  with a gay  guy  I  to this  day  I don't  know if  he's  come out  officially  but  there's  always been  that suspicion  um  did he turn  him  or was  he  I will not  no  I think  he was  way gay 
[03:26:30]  before I  even met  him  so  I  I  clear up  a rumor  sideways  pussy  or not  it's  mythbusters  here  we're doing  a mythbusters  that they  can't do  on mythbusters  I'm gonna go  plausible on  this one  plausible  I don't  I don't  think mine  sideways  no  no  it is  very  narrow  though  very narrow  like what  do you  mean  tight  tight  yeah  that's  true  that myth 
[03:27:00]  is true  I think  she means  that she  doesn't have  a lot  of um  not like  a lot  of exterior  lasagna  hanging out  or anything  no she does  not  I can tell  you  it's just  a little  she's got  feeling  like a little  just a line  and that  and that's  it  is that  what you're  saying  they're not  fat  like juicy  but  um  they're  but they're  not like  non-existent  does  maybe a  minora  come out  at all  or is it  all on  the inside  I think  it's mostly  on the inside  it's like 
[03:27:30]  halfway out  kind of  I would say  you got a little  bit hanging out  there  a little bit  that's nice  that's nice  just enough  alright  yeah  just getting a little  get to know you  section  are you currently  dating anyone  um  no I'm currently  not dating  I'm not seeing  anyone consistently  no  just kind of  casually dating  here and there  yeah  pretty much  just one night  stands  things like that  I don't do  one night stands  no huh  two dates  no  three  how many  you need  it depends  it depends 
[03:28:00]  on how  it's comfortable  I feel  how many you need  before the old  uh  yeah  it's usually been  well it's only been  with people I was  in relationships with  so it was always like  months  so how far do you go  on a date  like say like uh  you and a random person  may go out  and eat  you probably  you probably make out  a little bit  if you're feeling it  but you don't go  much farther than that  yeah  on the first date  maybe a little  wiener cup  maybe  I've started  really like my dick  getting slapped  by the way  and I don't know  what that means  wow  not hard  you're getting  he turned  Jimmy just turned 
[03:28:30]  to the audience  to let them know  not hard  but I really do  kind of like  holding it up  and having it  kind of slapped  a little bit  really  you betcha  that  no  that's  that's for more  gentle play  most times you're right  but you'd be surprised  how good slap  along the back  of the old cock  straightens you out  I don't think  I need that  kind of straightening out  it's up to you  second base  as they call it  on the first date  what is second base  these days  second base 
[03:29:00]  is  yeah  right up the ass  right up the old  no I'm kidding  of course  second base  is  feeling  the titties  yes yes  putting your hand  up the shirt  or down the shirt  or whatever  again it depends  it's all  that could be  first date  it could be  could be  do you consider  oral sex  sex  where you would  do that  on the first date  no I don't  consider it sex  uh huh  so you would  depends on how  far along  the conversation  has gone  and how deep 
[03:29:30]  and how  comfortable  I feel  intellectually  I really have  to connect  intellectually  with a person  before  to give a blow jump  intellectually  well  I'm a Virgo  like Virgos  have to feel  intellectually  stimulated  in order  to feel  sexually  stimulated  of course  it all  comes from  the way  so what Lily  is saying  is the way  into her pants  is through  her mind  through her mind  ah  through her hat  if you want to  keep it in the  clothing  that's like  Confucius say  yeah  yes 
[03:30:00]  him with small  mind  get no wet  on dick  tip  Confucius actually  did say that  once  very eloquently  put  so um  you have to be  very mentally  attracted to somebody  before you would  consider  grabbing their penis  and  exactly  I have to feel  like they  and also that  they respect me  mentally as well  to feel protected  excellent point  I need to feel  protected  during sex  you should  why  who's not  making you feel  that way  oh that's 
[03:30:30]  wow  you're weird  why  you're just a little  weird  why  I don't know  there's some kind  of weird  sexual thing  about you  that you're  a prude  but you're  a slut  a virgin horror  complex  right  I think  really understands  her sexuality  a lot  like a lot  of women  are smart  she knows  that she's  really sexy  and she knows  how to use her  not that she's  a cockteaser  because I think  she'd have sex  if she likes  somebody  but she knows  how to use 
[03:31:00]  her sexuality  she's very aware  of it  it's almost like  a guy with big  muscles who's not  going to knock  your teeth out  but understands  that if he stands  a certain way  you're going to get  the impression  that your teeth  might get knocked  out  you know what I mean  it's like  so he's not  intimidating you  but yet he is  it's almost  cockteaser  but not quite  did you ever  date anybody here  around here  no  that was a  firm no  not into 
[03:31:30]  dating people  in the workplace  well  everyone's here  is taken  in a long term  relationship  everyone here  is worth dating  oh  really  I mean  but Jimmy's  a freebie  I didn't think  of on air staff  Jimmy's free  what would you  think of anyone  but  oh god  alright well  what about this  guys are married  they're dead  yeah  you single  yes  yeah  how long 
[03:32:00]  nobody will  ever love me  oh wow  come on now  I mean  wow  I could  certainly understand  why you'd feel  that way  um  you might not  be wrong  but why  have you ever  I'm kidding  stupid  why  I'm sure you  got laid  before now  nope  are you a virgin  how old are you  19  that's right  I was 18  the first time I fucked  oh you're only 19  I'm not the youngest  person here anymore  how old are you  20  I just turned 20  now  oh uncle Paul  so you are  you are 
[03:32:30]  you're a 19 year old virgin  you're just a girl  uh no  what  yeah  never  nope  not even like  13 or something  what was the problem  well  a little shy  no  no  no  I'm not shy  just  I'm fat  and unattractive  holy shit  you'd be surprised  though dude  you got no self confidence  you gotta use your personality  cause you got a personality  obviously  so you gotta use that  physically I've never been a fucking  complete charm reader  it's like I bat out of my league 
[03:33:00]  all the time  Jim  that's exactly what me and Pat Duffy  were telling him about  in the back office  that you  know your self confidence  that you know  you know how to be self deprecating  with confidence  did we ask for a hole  no but I like the fact  I like the fact  hold on  no no  Lily raised a good point  as she was trying to boost him up  she went  and look  look at that piece of shit  over there on the third line  now if that sack of titted potatoes  can get laid  who can't  um 
[03:33:30]  but it's all personality  you talk your way into pussy  I mean I  I  women don't fuck me up  because of how I look  ever  it's rare  that they  you know I mean  it's um  they tolerate my appearance  because of  from the neck up  so that's what you got  at the angle  you gotta work man  I'll try that then  mmm  you have a Jonah Hill  thing going on  I've been told that  and he's very charismatic  and  a lot of hot chicks like him  see he has charisma 
[03:34:00]  one thing I don't have  it's also in million dollar movies  yeah  so you've just  uh  it was helpful Sam  what  what  what keeps you from  maybe  improving things  that you don't  think  people will find attractive  like perhaps  your weight  perhaps  laziness  and cakes taste good  just laziness  but don't you understand  that  if maybe  you dropped some pounds  and stuff  and started feeling  better about yourself  that maybe  other people would see  more confident person 
[03:34:30]  and stuff  it's kind of the self-loathing thing  just  I have these  I've got  I've tried that before  but it's just like  it  in my head  it still doesn't matter  it's a very fucked up way  of living my life  but  it's what you  it's what your low self  just pick your mic up  oh I'm sorry  it's what you tell yourself  deep down  so you can continue acting out  it's like food's  a brutal addiction  food's a fucking hard one  cause you got to eat  but it's almost like  well I'm not worth it  but the bottom line is  we all love to act out  it feels good  it's safe  uh  you know 
[03:35:00]  so you tell yourself  that's not gonna make any difference  so you can continue  fucking acting out  but you're not that big a dude  you're a little heavy  but you're not a fucking monster  no no  it's not even like  you're a monster  where you need to lose  uh you know  a couple of hundred pounds  or anything like that  yeah  you just kinda  lose some weight  what the fuck  that's such a weird thing  it's one of those  adorable fat kids  oh great  that means  she would never fuck you  yeah  that's a friend  that's a friend  that's every girl  I've ever talked to  yep  every girl  here's what that means  that means that she would  give you a kiss on the cheek  lovingly  while she was just 
[03:35:30]  burping up the cum  of a stud  dude  how many girls  through school  and everything like that  have you just been  head over heels  in love with  about six  that just  don't even  fucking give a shit  about six  almost every girl  I knew in high school  yeah  like  any girl that would give you  the time of day  was to you  like oh my god  I would love to  fucking you know  have a relationship  with this girl  and then you just  end up  you know  heartbroken 
[03:36:00]  thank you  see  your pal  Anthony  can relate to that  thank you Anthony  it's horrible  and thanks to Danny  he just handed me  a pussy in a can  yes the pussy in a can  which won't reject you  yes  doesn't care  sweet  how big you are  you're the guy friend  basically  and like you talk  to them right  and you kind of hold  that like  do you look for  every signal  that they do  you're like  is this when  she's gonna let me  know she likes me  like  but meanwhile  it doesn't  doesn't mean that  at all  no  and you're the one  they talk to  about the broken  relationships  yeah 
[03:36:30]  and the boyfriends  and the lucky guys  that are fucking them  yeah  wow  this happened to  happened to me  like a month ago  oh shit  yeah  what happened  well her and I  were friends  we reconnect  we used to go  to high school  together  she moved to  Staten Island  which is like  I live in Brooklyn  so that's like  miles away  and no way  to get out there  and we reconnect  bridge  yes  I'm too portable  over the bridge  oh real  okay  too poor  for the Verrazano  you know  can't even argue  that point  in this day and age  and we reconnect  through Facebook 
[03:37:00]  and we end up  like going out  going out  and doing stuff  a few times  and just like  you know  it's like  uh-huh  random playing  we uh  so like what  was it a date  type thing  or  kinda  uh  she took me  to the hospital  so she can get  the morning after pill  holy shit  did she  was she looking  to  she didn't  she thought  she got raped  the night  like a few days  before this  wow  pick a winner  I picked 
[03:37:30]  I picked good ones  she thought  she was raped  yeah  why  what  did she buy  an iPhone  so she thinks  she was raped  she got drunk  the few days  before  obviously  yes  underage drinking  go ahead for it  kids  but  and she wakes  up  and she  like her clothes  were a mess  and her hair  is all around  and she  kinda feels funny  you know  where her cunt  is  yeah  so 
[03:38:00]  her friend  takes her  to the hospital  to get checked  out  and she doesn't  want her parents  to know this  I don't care  if I'm outing  this on the radio  I burned my bridges  already  you just can't  say her name  that's all  yeah  let's just call  her Leticia  for the radio  it's not her name  right  no  no  definitely not  it's not even  close to her name  African American girl  no  ok  we picked a black  name  that was odd  I just  it was just  stuck in my head  I don't know why  Leticia  I don't know  anyway  and then she  goes to the hospital  she gets checked  out  and  we wanna 
[03:38:30]  I wanted to  hang out with her  she said  oh yeah  come to the city  meet me at my job  and we'll go  do  we'll go out  and do some stuff  after I go to the hospital  I didn't know  why she got in the hospital  maybe like she got cut  maybe she got sick  maybe she had to get a checkup  and then we're walking to the hospital  and she says  oh yeah  I might  I think I might be pregnant  I have to get the morning after pill  someone may have raped me  what's your answer  what's your answer  to something like that  um  you should have yelled  lucky them  that would have 
[03:39:00]  really turned her off  I would have  but we were in Harlem  so I was just trying  to maintain composure  and just keep walking  wow  yeah  in Harlem  she might have been raped  was she a Columbia student  uh no  no no  she goes to school  in the city though  but she lives uptown  uh no  she lives in Staten Island  dude that sounds like  an easy lay  yeah  not for me  because well  like me  she's emotionally  vapid  and dead  those are the best kind  yeah I know  I tried  I tried numerous times  but  and each time 
[03:39:30]  I would  I think I would  I was thinking  I was getting closer and closer  closer and closer  but  then  a week or two ago  she  I check on Facebook  and it says  oh her relationship status changed  uh oh  and Facebook is now  the arbiter of doom  for every lovelorn  boy and girl in America  aw  I check  and I look at this douchebag  who's her boyfriend now  and  I just  you ever see a person  that you know  you want to spit in their face  just by looking at them  uh yeah  yeah that was that guy  basically  nobody you meet  and he was just that guy 
[03:40:00]  and it was just  antagonizing me  to no end  and I just  how is he antagonizing you  no it was  no it was just  internally  yeah yeah  he built up this hatred for him  like he picked  she picked him over me  and it was just like that  you know  bullshit  good looking guy or anything  not really  no  had like that man beard  like hey man  we're gonna make a difference  and he had all these causes  on his Facebook  a real jack off  man  he does  one of those man beards 
[03:40:30]  yeah  guy has a beard  he's trying to change things  he sounds like a real pile of turds  no he just looked like a shit bag  yeah  what you want to do is this  you hit the gym a little bit  I know it sucks  yeah  I'll tell you  you'll feel better man  once you lose a few  you'll fucking feel like  wow I'm doing something  you will feel so much more confident  and better  chicks respond  I'm telling you  yeah I don't know  how your laziness  like  your laziness  can't outweigh  your misery  yeah  well sometimes  I'd rather watch porn  and play Madden  than go to the gym  we all would 
[03:41:00]  yeah  who the fuck wouldn't  no one likes the gym  gay men like the gym  no one  who doesn't like dick  likes the gym  if the gym was a great place  there'd be lines  out in front of the place  like holy shit  with this line move  I need to get into the gym  you walk in there  it's a few muscle heads  and some fatties  trying to lose some weight  yeah  you gotta you know  get in there  but I think that might change your  outlook on things  yeah  on yourself  you seem a little  you seem a little down on yourself  a little bit  yeah 
[03:41:30]  you could lose a few pounds  and your confidence level  would go up  and you'd eventually go out  and you'd eventually have a girl  tongue your bag  and you would look at things differently  or I could just get a van  and go to the playground  and have a little fun  alright so you don't try to be funny  no  not that we dislike pedophile humor  but this is serious  okay I'm sorry  we're all about pederast jokes  we're trying to fix you here a little bit  I know  we're trying to help you young man  yes  the lovely Lily  who I just want to  just point out  is a very honest girl  and she was telling you 
[03:42:00]  that you're like a cuddly teddy bear  thank you  I'd be surprised  at how much girls don't mind  extra weight  can you say that again  the mic is off  you'd be surprised  at how much girls don't mind  extra weight  yes he would be  no  yeah  I don't know about that  it goes along with being tall  like the bigger they are  the more you feel like  they can protect you  oh yeah  yeah  fuck  never heard that 
[03:42:30]  cool  the more they can wrap around you  the bigger you are  the bigger they can protect you  not that I'm like a chubby chaser  or anything  but  he's right here Lily  he's listening  yeah  chubby chaser  yeah  so no dating  no kissing  no  I can't  I can't fathom  that you don't know  what it feels like  to kiss a girl  have you  have you  fantasized about that  I mean obviously  you must have 
[03:43:00]  but  yeah  it's like a blind person  trying to ask them  you know  how do you see green  it's like  you can't imagine  what it's like  to have your dick  in some chick's mouth  they don't know  what color is blind people  they don't know  what reds are  no of course not  they just know  ah that's my foot  and um  the blare of horns  they stupidly step out  onto 57th street  this is what blind people know  it's hot  it's cold  nah  move  nah 
[03:43:30]  I had to help a blind man  across the street  you did  recently  yeah  he's like  could somebody help me  and everybody just ignored him  and I went over  and I'm like  yeah  and he goes  could I grab your arm  and I actually just walked him  across the street  really  yeah  don't you put your elbow out  and they like  grab onto your elbow  I put out my elbow  and I went  here stupid  and he dragged it across  what are you blind  exactly  tell him that  and I berated him 
[03:44:00]  and I suggested  just leave him in the middle  that's what you should have done  pulled your elbow away  in the middle of the intersection  what do you fucking think  I went all the way  across the street  I had to go  somewhere  there and buy a picture frame  just put him there  start walking on the double yellow  and go  you okay now  yeah okay  exactly  and then he'll just continue  walking down the middle of the road  hey use your radar  like the rest of the fruit bats  don't fucking pester me  help him write  like maybe a foot and a half  in front of a wall 
[03:44:30]  and just be like okay  and then turn my  and then turn my video camera on  and say  you gotta run  there's a car coming  or no  a plate glass window  yeah  run  in front of a bank  you have him run  like into a bank window  and then get arrested  and he fucking gets charged  then you throw a fucking  a gun on him  like  and then he gets charged  with attempted bank robbery  and he's like  but I'm blind  all because he just wanted  a little help  across the street  one minute I'm hanging upside down  pissing ammonia 
[03:45:00]  all over a cave floor  and the next minute  I'm being put on trial  a man helped me  I don't know what happened  he told me to run fast  he told me there was  a stampede of elephants  chasing me  I've never seen an elephant  oh wow  look at the time  how quickly it's gone  and with this snow going  my goodness  I have to get back  to Long Island  I gotta say  it really did start snowing  it did  but I know it's gonna turn to rain  before any accumulation
