<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated discussion about Reverend Al Sharpton's planned "Civil Disobedience Day" protesting the Sean Bell case acquittal.  The hosts vehemently condemned Sharpton's actions, labeling it a "terrorist threat," and questioned why he hadn't been arrested.  They speculated on the potential for violence during the protest, particularly during rush hour.  Numerous callers contributed, offering diverse viewpoints on the protest, police brutality in different neighborhoods, and the complexities of race relations and policing in America.  The segment included a satirical song about Sharpton, lighter news items (like the death of a Baskin-Robbins founder), sports updates, and discussion of the Democratic primary.  A Philadelphia police brutality video further fueled the conversation about police misconduct.  

Next, Rich Voss recounted a confusing and poorly remembered White House tour.  His rambling account, focusing on a coin, a botched Statue of Liberty in a Norman Rockwell painting, a "big screen," and "gun closets," prompted much mockery from the hosts.  They repeatedly compared his story to a child's show-and-tell, and poked fun at his apparent superior knowledge of Baskin-Robbins.  A caller jokingly accused Voss of blowing off a Secret Service agent offering a West Wing tour. The hosts tested his US government knowledge, revealing significant gaps in his understanding of the branches of government, the Bill of Rights, and presidential succession (incorrectly identifying the Bay of Pigs as the near-World War III event of 1962).

Club Soda Kenny then provided his traffic and weather report, peppered with darkly comedic accident descriptions and a phone slam prank.  Bob Kelly joined the show, detailing his "relic hunting" trip to Guatemala, recounting perilous journeys, humorous encounters with locals, and the omnipresent armed guards. He described his mispronunciation of “Guatemala” as “Gualamala”.  Further jokes targeted Voss's White House tour narrative.

Kelly, still in studio, continued recounting his Guatemalan adventures, displaying what he claimed were Mayan knife heads.  The hosts and callers expressed extreme skepticism, mocking his "junk."  He detailed challenging roads, encounters with locals, and a near-miss with armed guards at a checkpoint while attempting to adopt a child. The conversation expanded to include graphic descriptions of his amoebic dysentery, American Idol, a phone scam, and another graphic police brutality video.  Rich Voss participated, and numerous callers contributed to the often crude and offensive humor.

The show shifted to a news story about a two-year-old smoking marijuana, transitioning into a conversation with Patrice O’Neal about his negative experience at Seattle's Giggles comedy club. O’Neal described the owner's unprofessional behavior, including late or unpaid wages and forcing comics to work as drivers and staff.  He detailed the owner's attempt to overpay him and then reclaim the overpayment, linking Kelly's cancelled Giggles appearance to O'Neal's presence the previous week.  The conversation then moved to Jimmy "The Waddle's" sex addiction, featuring graphic details of his masturbation habits and emotional disconnect with sex.

The discussion became explicit with Wendy the trucker, a self-identified sex addict, sharing graphic details of her numerous sexual encounters, particularly at truck stops, and hinting at possible childhood sexual abuse.  Other callers joined in with explicit accounts of sexual behavior.  The segment continued with discussions of sex addiction, interspersed with off-color jokes and banter.

The broadcast concluded with a segment focusing on the hosts’ past sexual exploits, including attempts to manipulate women into sexual acts with their friends. This was followed by discussions on the definition of "gay" and a fictionalized, graphic story involving Pete Rose and oral sex.  Will and Charlotte called in to discuss their experiences with group sex, offering contrasting views on the "gayness" of certain sexual situations.  Numerous callers expressed appreciation for Rich Voss. The show ended with the "Line of the Day" sponsored by FTD.com, and a humorous anecdote about a raccoon attacking one of the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Do you play a prostitute, bipolar?  Me too.  Fantastic.  Jimmy's in love.  Wonderful.  Both qualities I look for when I meet someone.  You are sick, freaks!  Chris Benoit.  Oh boy.  It's so weird.  I leaned on the machine by accident and it hit a button. 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  How fast did you get it up to?  180 miles an hour.  What's the matter with you, you idiot?  Cut the s***.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, it's going to be an interesting day here in New York City.  Good morning.  Why are we very bassy today?  Very bassy.  Yeah.  Once again, very bassy.  Bassy in the headphones.  Nah.  All right.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Also got to crank the rage music.  What's going on here?  Some settings a little askew.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:02:00]  Does it sound loud to you, Ed?  It just sounds like bassy.  A little weird.  A little bassy.  Yeah.  There's something weird going on.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  All right.  We got a lot to do today.  That's for sure.  God, I got to turn on everyone's mic.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Radio people are very strange people.  One setting slightly off.  Everything falls apart.  Yeah.  You need everything to sound exactly like it did yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  It has to sound like it was yesterday.  Everything has to be the same.  Or it kind of throws you off.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  We're broadcast live from New York City.  And Reverend Al is shutting down the city.  Because I guess he has superpowers.  I guess he's special.  Yeah.  For some reason, he's able to just shut down the city.  With impunity, I guess.  I know that we have a lot of people listening all over the place. 
[00:03:00]  But this is a biggie.  And just imagine, in your fine city, this happening.  If Reverend Al has scheduled a civil disobedience day.  Yeah.  You know how when we were growing up, we had Earth Day and all these cute little days.  Yeah.  Well, Reverend Al has his own day.  It's called Civil Disobedience Day.  And he has a schedule.  Yeah.  Of places and times and what he's going to do. 
[00:03:30]  So, why hasn't he been arrested yet?  Yeah.  This is a threat.  Why wait until 3 o'clock?  Arrest him now!  Yeah, because they say there's going to be arrests of people that block traffic.  His whole scheme is to go around major thoroughfares in the city during the rush hour home.  I guess starting about 3 o'clock.  3 o'clock.  But let me tell you something.  You should go home now, Anthony, because this isn't starting at 3 o'clock. 
[00:04:00]  You know that, right?  Yeah.  People are going to start gathering, I would guess, late morning.  Yeah.  At the latest.  Yeah.  Why isn't he arrested?  He should be arrested right now for even coming up with this.  This is a terrorist threat.  Absolutely it is.  If anybody else had come up with this idea and publicly said, this is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to hold a city hostage, you'd be arrested.  Why is this being allowed? 
[00:04:30]  Because he's got power.  He's, I think.  Superpowers?  I hate to say it, but I think there's a lot of people scared of Reverend Allen in this city.  Oh my God, you're kidding.  Go get him now and arrest him.  Arrest him immediately.  Just immediately.  Basically, as far as Manhattan goes, we've got a couple tunnels and a couple bridges  to get in and out, for the most part.  He is having these pray-ins right around those areas where we leave Manhattan. 
[00:05:00]  Right near the bridges, right near the tunnels.  Yeah.  At police headquarters and a couple other areas.  Oh look, Day of Civil Disobedience.  There's your schedule, everybody.  Yeah, just in case.  How do they list where they're going to do it?  Doesn't that kind of remove?  Yeah, that's spontaneity.  Yeah.  No, and the news, shame on the news.  We're not going to read the schedule.  We're kind of telling you, you know, he's obviously closing where people are commute in and out of the city from.  But the news, they don't even realize what they're doing.  They're just putting the schedule up all morning long. 
[00:05:30]  We've already seen the schedule, I don't know, ten times.  We've only been here an hour.  Yeah.  And that was done on purpose to get the word out.  The media is helping Reverend Al today.  Of course they are.  There's the schedule for everybody that wants to be bad boys and girls today.  And then they'll get the news.  They'll be there anyway.  And that'll attract attention.  It's just one of these situations where if anybody, and we mentioned a radio station.  Right.  You know, if you're a radio show and you want to do something a little wacky. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Hey, we're going to get a bunch of people there to gather by the 59th Street Bridge and close down traffic.  How about that?  You'd be fired.  Arrested.  Yeah, just arrested.  Blackballed from the business.  Of course.  You can't do that.  Isn't this just against the law to make this threat?  I don't know what's going on.  Maybe somebody that knows a little something, something could explain why Reverend Al is allowed to do this without getting arrested ahead of time. 
[00:06:30]  Everyone knows he's the one behind this.  Yeah.  He's organizing this terrorist threat, if you ask me.  Against New York City.  This is unsafe.  And way to get us on your side there, Reverend Al.  Yeah, we're going to understand what's going on in the Sean Bell case because of what you're doing today.  Yeah, that's going to get a lot of sympathy.  Thanks.  Civil disobedience. 
[00:07:00]  I'm telling you, there's a lot of people that listen to us as they get their day going.  Call in sick.  Why?  Call in sick right now.  Do not bother.  Today is going to be a nightmare.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Just hit the gas when you see a bunch of people.  Huh?  Just hit the gas when you see a bunch of people go right through.  I think it's going to get ugly today.  I really do.  I think it's going to be...  You think it's the start of the big one?  Dude, if somebody...  W3?  Dude, if someone breaks down, has a little flat tire, all hell breaks loose in the city.  And, you know, that person is almost like pushed over the bridge with their car just so people could get home faster. 
[00:07:30]  I think this is going to turn out to be an ugly, ugly event today here in New York City.  And it just amazes me.  There's Reverend Al getting all the attention on every channel.  Oh, they're loving it.  They got interviews with Reverend Al.  It's going to be a big one.  And here's a reporter broadcasting live from one of the locations.  I'm telling you, this is going to be extremely ugly today.  Race war!  Race war! 
[00:08:00]  Hey!  Let's say hi to Danny in New York.  Danny.  Yeah, hi.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Pretty good.  We're trying to figure out why Reverend Al could schedule a day of civil disobedience and he's not arrested.  It's amazing, isn't it?  I think it is.  The difference between all May and now Mayor Bloomberg, and don't get me wrong, he's pretty good at me, at least from what I think,  compared to Rudy Giuliani.  Rudy Giuliani wouldn't even schedule any meetings with Reverend Al. 
[00:08:30]  He wouldn't.  You've got Bloomberg, on the other hand, who's granting this guy, who's granting these people permits for the street closures.  Wait, wait, how do you grant a permit to close a street down during rush hour?  There's no way in hell a permit was granted.  You know what, he's going to sit there and, you know, I saw the broadcast yesterday and he sat there on TV saying, you know, so on and so forth.  You know, those are violators of the law, but we will be, we will protect those people's rights. 
[00:09:00]  There can't be a permit.  There cannot be a permit.  It's hard to believe that there's actually permits that were granted to shut down New York City during rush hour.  Sympathetic, isn't it?  And you're right.  You guys are absolutely right.  Do your dumb protests in the middle of the night while we're sleeping.  Exactly.  Thank you.  That's exactly my point.  As soon as I heard you guys say it, oh, it's going to be a great day, and I'm like, oh, this is going to be good. 
[00:09:30]  Well, it's going to get interesting.  Oh, it certainly is.  Definitely.  You're really not going to, you're really not going to get sympathy.  This is not going to be very sympathetic.  Wow.  But you know what?  Like you said, the media's going to cover it, and the people are going to sit there, and you know what?  I think it was the best thing, letting these cops get off.  Why is this, why is this Reverend Al?  All right, thank you.  Okay.  Later.  Why is this Reverend Al special?  I don't get it.  Yeah.  Why is he allowed to do this?  And you talk to, you talk to black people, they say, hey, he doesn't represent me. 
[00:10:00]  Well, he's representing somebody.  Somebody.  He's representing.  That's for sure.  And he gets away with pretty much, eh.  Even though the cops, you know, a couple of the cops were black that were acquitted.  Yeah.  Eh.  It's all right.  It's still a black-white issue.  That's why.  Because Reverend Al wants it to be.  That's why there wasn't riots in the city.  I'm telling you, if those cops had been white and acquitted, there would have been riots.  Of course.  Because there were black cops, it was a police issue and not a, it's, he, it's just a police issue. 
[00:10:30]  I'm telling you, they would have been riots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas, Texas.  Max, what's up?  Hi, hi.  You guys, the city's getting closed down by a maniac.  Ours got closed down 43 years ago.  Boys, join the club.  All right.  Where's, where's Spider-Man when we need him?  They film all those dumb movies in New York City.  Where's Spider-Man?  We need Spider-Man to put a web around Reverend Al and take him away. 
[00:11:00]  Take him away.  Put him in a little net, web net.  Yeah, exactly.  Hang him in the middle of the street so he could just kind of try to fight his way out of the web.  That's what we need, a real hero.  Reverend Al just needs to go away.  Yeah, he's irrelevant.  Let's go to Dave in Canada.  Dave.  Hey, you know, I was just wondering if you had that Reverend Al clip when you did that song shoot I remember from a while back.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, we could play the Reverend Al song.  It's funny.  Anthony wrote and sung this 10 years ago, and it still makes perfect sense today. 
[00:11:30]  Still exactly what Reverend Al's all about.  All about getting publicity more for himself.  He wants to get publicity for himself first.  Loves it.  I hope people understand that in the end.  Publicity for himself first, and then maybe get some things done for others.  I wish I had a dime for every time that word's going to be used today.  Wow.  You got the Reverend Al song there?  I'm sorry.  It's just when you're stuck in traffic, that's what happens. 
[00:12:00]  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan?  Yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's staffing off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me? 
[00:12:30]  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The porphy little reverend with an ass just like a bus.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now, why is the white man always picking on me? 
[00:13:00]  Remember Bertie gets in the brawdy case.  Turn on the TV.  You would always see his face.  He's speeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  On the never-ending search for some good publicity. 
[00:13:30]  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming right.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Now, as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's a race, fake, white, hate, and bad to follow me. 
[00:14:00]  Now, why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Love that song.  Reverend Al.  It still makes sense.  Pretty much written and sung eight years ago.  What there?  Just want to say I heard a little shoehorning of the word baloney.  There was a little shoehorning.  I must admit.  I must confess.  I want some baloney.  Baloney.  Very funny, though.  Just a bit.  Let's go to Steve.  I had a shoehorn a word. 
[00:14:30]  You're right.  I'm guilty.  Stupid parody ass.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve, let's go.  Let's go, buddy.  What's going on?  What do you got, Steve?  I'm a law student here on Long Island.  I just want to let you guys know about how it's called the Parkway Act, where you can't  block the roadway in an attempt to stop traffic in that way.  So, do you honestly think there's going to be no stoppage of traffic today? 
[00:15:00]  Of course there is.  They're always in the way, them damn people, man.  They don't work.  They block the roads.  Oh, boy.  Now they're all getting paid to stop us from getting paid.  And we pay them.  They take it out of our checks, you know?  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  So, there's the people that are really going to be impressed by this demonstration.  Yeah.  And I think the cops are in a very bad position today.  Oh, yeah.  So, I guess technically you're not allowed to block roadways, okay? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  So, I have a feeling that the order's going to come down.  Look, you've got to let them do what they're going to do today.  Because just imagine, they start blocking the roads, and then all of a sudden the cops swoop  in to do the right thing, right?  Start making arrests.  And then what happens?  Don't touch me.  Then it starts getting a little uglier.  What are you doing?  This is not going to work out too well today.  Well, Mace, I see a lot of tasers today.  Yeah?  I see new taser footage for tomorrow, I think.  Look for it on YouTube.  Let's say hi to Tom in Connecticut.  Tom. 
[00:16:00]  Hey, how are you?  Hey, Tom.  Hi.  Reverend Osama, Big Al, or whatever he is.  He's talking about his own little holy war over here.  He's praying about committing crime.  Now, why does the CIA pick him up and stick him on a war for him?  I don't know.  We take terrorism very serious in this country, obviously.  Very serious here in New York.  Yeah.  But this is allowed to go on?  That just amazes me.  It blows my mind.  It just blows my mind.  If anybody else was trying to do that, they would be picked up for treason. 
[00:16:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, this is a major city.  This is the pinnacle of the free world.  People are trying to conduct business here.  And you can't just shut down the city.  Let's say hi to Doug in Jersey.  Let's just see in advance.  I know.  That means at least five people are not going to show up for work today to go and carry  these folks.  Exactly.  Hey, Doug, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Nothing is going to happen.  This is going to be five people. 
[00:17:00]  I was in front of Madison Square Garden the other night.  There were a couple of lunatics with megaphones screaming about how the cops are coming after  you next, and you're going to get shot, and you're going to get...  And everybody was walking by laughing at them.  Yeah, but there's something...  That's what's going to happen today.  It's five people.  But see, this is organized.  Yeah, Reverend Al, I heard, said he had nothing to do with that one.  He is all about the one today.  There's a schedule on all the news channels that they're flashing every five to ten minutes.  You're crazy, Doug.  I say tens of thousands of people involved with this today. 
[00:17:30]  Tens of thousands.  No way.  I hope not.  Well, we'll...  No way.  We'll see tomorrow.  You call me out on it tomorrow, okay?  When only five people do this, you call me out on it tomorrow.  No problem.  I'm telling you, this is a biggie today.  A biggie.  It'll be a couple thousand people, I think, at least.  I really do.  I think it's going to be a couple thousand.  You can't.  It depends on how many people can get into the city.  It's just...  Huh?  What am I talking about?  I just said something, and they're like, what do you...  Well...  People live here.  Eight million people. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  I think this has potential to be a real biggie today.  Yeah, it could be a big cluster F, as they say.  Let me...  Let's say hi to Tom in Franklin Square.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Ron?  I ain't a little Jimmy.  Hey.  Basically, we worked one of these things already, one of the rallies they had, like,  right after the verdict was delivered, and we're told, you know, don't do anything unless  it gets a little too crazy.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So I really don't think that many people are going to show up.  They've had things already. 
[00:18:30]  We never know.  Reverend Al could, you know, pull one out.  That's why, you know, he's got it organized.  It's on the news.  I never heard of where these other demonstrations were supposed to be.  Did you hear anything about these other demonstrations, where they were going to be?  Now he's got a schedule.  Yeah.  It's on the news.  Everyone knows.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  This could be...  And the other guy, the other Reverend Calvin Butts, he's all up and, you know, trying to  get things organized.  Butts.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Have a good one.  Thank you. 
[00:19:00]  I want to say good morning to the NYPD.  Make sure you get a big breakfast in today.  You're going to need all your energy.  Have fun out there, guys.  Joe in New York, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just want to say there's another example of a scared white guy, that being Bloomberg,  afraid to stand up to these savages.  So, this is what happens, man.  Yeah.  Giuliani, man.  He had a lot of people that loved him and a lot of people that hated him.  But the one thing, he basically didn't acknowledge Reverend Allen when he was the mayor of New 
[00:19:30]  York City.  No.  And he would never have allowed this to happen.  No.  Not at all.  Not at all.  And this would be, this would be, there would be cops everywhere this guy said he was going  to be.  And the second one person showed up, they would be arrested or driven away.  There's no reason for this.  Right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Tyrone in Chicago.  Tyrone, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  How you all doing?  Pretty good, man.  Let me say, first of all, Jimmy, you are the wind beneath my wings. 
[00:20:00]  I just want to say, a fool come up in the St. Louis, I drove a truck, and I was down in  St. Louis here a few years ago.  And they had us backed up so far on traffic up there.  They shut down three major interstates there in St. Louis.  And some lady, I know they caused at least three accidents that I read about, and one  of them, which was me, when a lady drove up underneath my trailer there.  It was awesome.  I got in the damn room for this fool.  So you've been stuck in one of these before, in the past, huh?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  In St. Louis.  And I just want to say one more thing. 
[00:20:30]  I'd like to send it out to Reverend Al.  Get a job, you sparkling wiggle.  Wiggle longer.  That old gag.  Okay, terrific.  Well, city officials are bracing for a wave of protests today in response to the acquittals  of three officers charged in Sean Bell's death.  Reverend Al Sharpton laid out plans for what he is calling a day of civil disobedience.  Sharpton says those who take part in today's pray-ins should be prepared to go to jail.  The six locations for the protests are 125th Street.  Yeah, this shouldn't be that big of a deal when he is openly encouraging people to go 
[00:21:00]  to jail for this.  Go to jail.  That means don't listen to the cops.  Don't listen to anybody.  This is what we need to do.  Yeah.  Do whatever it takes.  And if it means go to jail, then go to jail.  Yeah, this is going to be five people.  That guy in Jersey was right.  I'm sorry.  The six locations for the protests are 125th Street and 3rd Avenue, 60th Street and 3rd  Avenue, 34th Street and Park Avenue, Varric and Houston Streets, one police plaza in lower 
[00:21:30]  Manhattan, and House of the Lord Church at 415 Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.  The protests are set to begin at 3 p.m.  Mayor Bloomberg says officers will be on hand to make sure everyone's rights are protected.  Hopefully that means the commuters, right?  Yeah, no kidding.  Who's going to go to the one at one police plaza?  Well, those would be the crazies.  Who's going to go to that one?  I'd be like, I think I'm going to go to the other one.  Yeah.  One police plaza.  They're just going to be waiting there with their zip strips. 
[00:22:00]  No one with the record.  Right.  No one with the records going down there.  You don't even have to load them into the trucks or anything.  Yeah.  How do you work this?  You see the schedule and you decide, huh, where do I need to be?  One police plaza.  That's a little close to lock up.  I got some warrants out.  Maybe I should avoid that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ian from Cleveland Media shouldn't promote this.  We just promoted this indirectly, by the way.  I mean, given the locations, that's ridiculous.  This is why there will never be peace between the races. 
[00:22:30]  That's what Frank on Long Island is saying.  So it's going to be a very, very interesting day.  It starts at three.  That means people are going to start gathering around noon.  They're going to start heading out from wherever around noon.  Well, I better get out of here than ASAP.  I think you should.  I think we should take the day off.  I agree.  It's early.  What?  What?  What happened?  Are they gathering now?  Yes.  They'll leave.  They're just going to hit drive and the gas.  That's it. 
[00:23:00]  How annoyed would you be if you got stuck in it?  Oh, don't put a tape recorder in my truck.  That's all I'm saying.  We should put a tape recorder in the truck today.  Oh, no.  No, we shouldn't.  No, we shouldn't.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  So fired.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Listen, the city issues the permits, but everybody has the right to protest.  The problem is they can't control the amount of people that show up for these.  They issue a permit for a certain amount of people to show up, and as we all know.  There's also got to be a right to gather, so they issue a permit for that. 
[00:23:30]  But where?  By the on-ramp of the 59th Street Bridge?  Yeah, that doesn't seem to be a good place to gather.  It's not like a park?  Anthony's right.  Usually when they give out these permits, it's a little out-of-the-way area.  It's a park.  It's a sidewalk.  Right.  You see them.  You see protesters as you're driving by.  You give them the finger.  You beep your horn if you're in support.  Whatever.  But it doesn't really stop business like today's going to. 
[00:24:00]  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  The on-ramp to the 59th Street Bridge is not a good place to give you a permit for.  You do it if you're a scared mayor.  Yeah, exactly.  We've got to take our first break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  Next, a little serious tone here, but we've got to get into the Hillary Obama thing.  Oh, yeah.  But then we've got some great, great stories for everybody today.  Stay there. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, we just got pwned really bad.  Pwned.  F-U, Eric Logan.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now I've got to explain.  We're all about, like, taking you inside the radio show.  So we go to break, and all of a sudden I get an email from Eric Logan, who runs XM Satellite Radio.  And it's in big red letters on my BlackBerry. 
[00:25:00]  And he types, can we meet for lunch, you, me, and Ant, after the XM show.  Oh, boy.  So I read this to Ant and Jimmy.  I'm like, oh, this isn't good.  What's going on?  Is Eric Logan leaving the company?  What's up?  Uh-huh.  You know?  So we're in a panic.  I write him back like, yeah, of course we could.  Well, this is exactly what I wrote.  I go, of course.  This doesn't sound good.  What's up?  But he writes back just before, literally seconds ago, and he writes, oh, all good.  Actually, I'm not there.  Just wanted to hear Ant yell about staying in the city today. 
[00:25:30]  I'm in Chicago.  What an ass.  Holy Jesus.  Do you know how worried you've had us?  He had us in a complete panic for the last five minutes.  Oh.  What an ass.  What an idiot.  That's why we love this guy.  And he doesn't know how much Ant likes him, because Ant wasn't even saying it.  Ant was like, well, call him.  See what's wrong.  He would call.  See if everything's okay.  You know?  Yeah.  Make sure his job is there.  Our job is here.  You know?  It just...  I thought it was some issue. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, is that funny?  Oh, man.  I've never seen Ant that panic.  Oh.  You'd never panic.  But he's like, go ahead.  Call him.  Yeah, go ahead.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  And he's just being a prankster.  Kilo the prankster.  Well, you know.  He over there, and it's just a cluster F, but you know, Ant and I have been doing this  radio thing together for about 14 years, and I gotta say, Eric Logan is the first guy 
[00:26:30]  that we're all in as far as listening to.  Yeah.  Before, Eric Logan was like, shut your trap.  Wouldn't listen to anybody.  Wouldn't listen to nobody.  Sometimes that would get us in trouble, but unfortunately, you know, corporate never really  put someone of like Eric Logan's caliber in front of us, so that's why there was always  issues with PDs and general managers and whatnot, but you know, we listen to Logan, and he's  really, really helped our show and helped our careers.  Yeah.  He's also an ass. 
[00:27:00]  He's a complete ass.  And he fits in perfectly with this show.  God.  All right, so.  Must have been sitting there drinking at 6 in the morning.  What can I do?  Well, I got a funny little gag I can play.  You might have to update that.  Rumor has it he doesn't partake.  He doesn't partake anymore.  Rumor has it.  Rumor has it.  What's called I get at 3 o'clock in the morning?  He's sober for?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just lonely. 
[00:27:30]  Jason in Buffalo, isn't this inciting a riot?  What's going on here in New York City today?  With Reverend Al, yeah.  Well, Reverend Al, you know, he has his own rules.  Let's go to Mike from the NYPD.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Long time ago, sir.  Thanks, Mike.  Say hi to the boys for us.  Hi, boys.  What's up, Mike?  No, I'm not.  It's this guy.  You know what?  Everybody's afraid of him.  The politics are afraid of him.  We get shunted for it all the time. 
[00:28:00]  And he's a tool.  Pretty simple.  Yeah, why are the politicians afraid of Reverend Al?  I don't get it.  Yeah, I don't get that at all.  Go arrest him right now, Mike.  You'll be a hero.  Go look.  I feel like this is against the law.  I feel it's sort of a terrorist act.  And go round him up before this starts.  Yeah.  Be the hero, Mike.  Be the hero.  No?  You know what?  All right.  Well.  No?  No?  Nothing? 
[00:28:30]  All right.  Hello?  No?  Nothing?  Oh, well.  All right.  And then people are talking about how there's going to be a lot of rubbernecking.  Let's go to Brian in Philly.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Brian.  I think Reverend Al's probably going to be coming to Philly next.  I don't know if you read or heard this last week.  There was three African-Americans that were involved in a shooting.  The cops chased him down, and they yanked him out of their cars and beat him with batons.  And it was caught on video by a local news chopper.  So, um...  Good.  And I hope they're showing that on every TV station down there in Philly. 
[00:29:00]  It's a...  I hope they're...  Oh, God.  Go ahead, Brian.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  I forgot I was calling you a radio show.  I'm sorry.  No, but you're not.  I'm sorry.  See, it's our show.  No, see, everyone has a podcast.  I forgot.  We're part of Brian's podcast today that he's doing from his car.  Go ahead, Brian.  I apologize, gentlemen.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, this is the day after one of our officers was shot and killed.  Yeah.  And our guys are on overtime trying to hunt down the remaining killer. 
[00:29:30]  So they're on edge, and they're exhausted.  And, of course, the media is blaming the victims, not the cops.  You know, the effing media in Philly, they're scared, too.  It's a war zone down in Philly.  I know a little bit about Philly these days, and there's cops being shot all the time.  Oh, the video is unbelievable.  Philadelphia police beat three innocent, all in capital letters, young black men.  It's on YouTube.  The cops might be a little on edge in there in Philadelphia. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  So that's what's going to bring Reverend Al to Philly?  That's what's going to bring him to Philly.  What are they doing?  The cops should know about it.  You can't do that in the middle of the street.  It's like there's too many video cameras.  I'm serious.  It's like, what are you guys doing?  You know this stuff gets caught on tape every time it happens.  Jimmy, you know what?  Thank God.  It's so entertaining.  Wonderful television.  I agree.  I agree with Jimmy.  It doesn't help their cause.  But I got to tell you, man, the cops down there have had it. 
[00:30:30]  They're watching their fellow officers being shot and killed.  It's not just one every once in a while.  It's an epidemic down there.  And the latest one I actually have a connection to because one of the Philly crew is a police  officer and worked for the guy that was killed.  I mean, they're out of their minds down there.  I'm just saying, if a guy has done a shooting and you're going to smack him around, just  do it at the station.  Yeah, wait until you get him into the station and then bash him around a little bit.  The street stuff.  But that's what's going to bring Reverend Al to Philly.  Why didn't he come to Philly before this?  Because everyone knows that the murder rate down there is just out of control. 
[00:31:00]  And cops are basically saying, we need help.  We need help from the federal government.  We need help from somebody here.  Help us out.  How about Reverend Al goes there to protest the killing of police officers?  No, huh?  No.  No one would join the protest.  I don't think you'll see that.  No, but the video is pretty crazy because, wow, how many cops were on that scene?  Like a dozen easily.  If not more, two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, four, close to 20 of them. 
[00:31:30]  They've had it.  They were chasing a car that they thought possibly one of the shooters or perpetrators was in.  They dragged them out.  And, yeah, we're watching from a helicopter.  The cops go to town on these guys.  That's going to cause major problems, obviously.  Was the guy a shooter?  Like, were they shooting?  They already killed one of them.  I mean, they hunt them down and kill them in Philly.  They're animals.  Yeah.  But they've also had it.  Yeah, they've just had it.  I guess there were three involved in the latest cop shooting down there, and I believe they 
[00:32:00]  hunted one down and killed them so far.  And they're looking for the other two.  I'm not positive, but I think that's about right.  Guys, you know better.  Like, you know in the age of video cameras that you can't do that.  All you're doing is making your own lives harder.  Yeah.  Because it's like there's going to be protests.  They're going to crack down.  Guys are going to get fired.  Yeah.  Just do it under an awning.  Let's go to Malik in Asbury Park.  Malik.  How was it pretty, fellas?  Yeah, what's good, fellas?  Hello.  Post show. 
[00:32:30]  Yo, listen, man.  Any other time, I roll with y'all.  But on this one, I can't take y'all side on this one.  And your listeners, they're wilding.  Look, this is the thing, man.  You know what I'm saying?  And me personally, I don't roll with Reverend Al like that all the time.  But the bottom line is that people forget it.  There was a man that was innocently shot 50 times.  And the thing is that this is a constant thing that's going on in the hood.  If this was a thing that was going on in the suburbs, in white areas, 
[00:33:00]  then I'm pretty sure there would be an outlash from certain white supporters.  Well, you know why it's not, though?  I'll tell you why it's not.  But because a bunch of white people aren't going around saying they have guns.  They're not.  What?  Who just said that?  Well, me.  I don't say it in public to the police.  And write down your brilliant rant, and I'll read it today.  Because it's going to be a little weak coming from you.  Jeez.  Wait a minute.  Let me think about that.  Say that we have guns. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, okay.  Malik, know what we hear in our neighborhoods when we open up the windows at night?  Crickets.  Lovely, lovely crickets in the middle of the night.  Yeah, this is us.  This is the white neighborhood.  Here's Whitey.  This is why it doesn't happen in white neighborhoods.  This is how we start our day every morning.  What are we going to do today?  That's wonderful.  Let me take a big breath of fresh air outside.  I'm ready to go to my wonderful white job.  Huh?  Malik, you're wrecking our bit. 
[00:34:00]  This could be a good one.  Yeah, we're not supposed to hear your voice.  Yeah.  We're going to give you a chance in a second, Malik.  Yeah.  But this is the white neighborhoods waking up in the morning.  Fresh orange juice, the newspaper.  You smell that coffee?  My kids still asleep upstairs.  Look how nice day it is.  Hey, there's Mr. Johnson just driving down the street.  Hi.  Hello, Mr. Johnson.  Hey, Bob. 
[00:34:30]  How are you?  Wait a minute.  Maybe both of us shouldn't talk at the same time.  They're going to think we're an alternative couple.  Oh, that's true.  I'm Anthony's neighbor in this bit.  Put some pants on.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, neighbor.  Hi, Greg.  How are you today?  I'm good.  In this fine, white neighborhood that we live in.  Do you think our wives are onto us yet?  Oh, I hope not.  And the relationship we're having?  You mean this whole DL thing we're doing?  That's right.  You got the black neighborhood yet? 
[00:35:00]  You want to do black neighborhood now?  All right, black neighborhood.  Of course.  Of course.  Yeah, boys.  We're in Europe. 
[00:35:30]  Well, they need all the help they can get.  I love that it's Biggie Smalls, our go-to hood music.  Jimmy, why are we shaking your head?  Too much?  No, just because even in black neighborhoods, people don't wake up and go, yeah, boy. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, that's all I know.  I get my stuff for Flavor Flav in the wire.  What can I tell you?  No one says that when they get out of bed in the morning.  No?  Yeah, it's like, yeah, boy, I made another D.  No?  I made another D.  Yes, Malik.  You guys are missing a bigger picture.  Yeah.  I'm missing a bigger picture.  Like, look, this police brutality is happening every day, and it goes unaccounted for.  It's not to say that, you know, there's not crimes on cops.  That's wrong, too.  You know, I'm not trying to say that, you know, go out there and bust your gun on cops. 
[00:36:30]  No, but look.  But just the ratio of police brutality in these neighborhoods is ridiculous, B, and it needs to stop.  Why is there police brutality, do you think, in the neighborhoods, in the hood?  Well, I can tell you this, and this is from personal experience.  Okay.  You know what I'm saying?  When you're getting off of work and you're walking home and you see five police cars with their sirens on blazing jump out the car, pull guns on you, telling you to get on the ground, and you don't know what for, 
[00:37:00]  you know, you start to feel a certain way after a while.  Well, why are you working at the Starbucks in the white neighborhood?  Y'all think they'll have to teach it.  No, I don't.  Now, that happened to you.  You were walking down the street, and this happened at Asbury Park, right down the street.  Now, is that the police department's fault, or perhaps did you fit a description of somebody that they were looking for? 
[00:37:30]  Every black person fits the description, and that's their cop-out.  You fit the description.  Okay, what description?  I obliged the police officer.  Young black male wearing a whatever hoodie, something like that.  There you go.  All right, well, you know something?  Perhaps if the crime rate wasn't so disproportionate amongst young black men that the police wouldn't have to be in your business all the time. 
[00:38:00]  You know what?  I kind of disagree with you on that.  All right.  I think it's what's reported.  Now, in some areas, of course, you've got areas like Asbury Park, Bedside, Brownsville.  Those are worse areas than Bensonhurst.  Yeah, but there's still crimes that go on that's not reported and hyped up like the media does in these black neighborhoods, and it's ridiculous, B.  I don't know.  It always seems to me, though, that the cops are kind of between a rock and a hard place when it comes to arresting black guys and questioning black guys and just pulling over black guys. 
[00:38:30]  It just always seems like, yeah, I know.  You know, it's got to be a bitch.  I've got to tell you, it's got to be a bitch to be a young black guy that isn't breaking the law because you are constantly being pulled over and stopped and questioned.  And I think the anger should lie with the young black men that are committing crimes instead of the police. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, if enough time goes by where there isn't a disproportionate amount of crime committed by young black men, I think the police will start leaving young black men alone.  And, you know, why would they keep harassing you?  Skin color?  I think we're really past that.  I honestly think we're past that.  I don't think we are.  It's a reality.  Racism is still alive and well.  Yeah, but it's not so much based on skin color as it is what Martin Luther King said, content of character. 
[00:39:30]  There is, you know, I don't think people are basing their opinions on the color of people's skin anymore.  Hold on.  Let me just make sure I heard Anthony say that one, too.  Yes.  Problem?  No, no.  Just make sure.  But it's not.  Where's Anthony today?  It's this.  It is the content of people's characters that you judge.  You drank too much last night and your brain cells aren't back together yet?  I love Anthony being quoted Martin.  I know.  It's like the good Dr. King said, what show is this? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Where's your David Duke quotes?  One minute ago, Anthony's like, it's not like a bunch of white people have guns.  Then he's quoting Dr. King.  What are you doing?  Where's Anthony?  I don't know.  Do you have a fever?  It's the opium imposter show.  There's a man sitting in Anthony's seat.  No kidding, man.  He actually just quotes.  Pardon me, Malik.  He just quoted content of character.  Yeah.  He doesn't believe in that.  I know.  Have you ever yelled that out a window?  You're not behaving up to your potential, young individual. 
[00:40:30]  Why the content of your character stinks.  You can't tell the content of someone's character driving a car.  All you see is that's a young black guy driving a brand new Range Rover.  I refuse to get a brand new car because I know it's going to happen to me.  Right on, man.  All right, Malik.  We got to let you go.  I hear you.  You know, and like I said, it's got to be a bitch.  It really does.  I'm with you there.  All right, fellas.  You can steal my niggas.  Peace. 
[00:41:00]  Hey!  No joke.  Tim Jersey, what's going on?  What is it?  I want to hug Anthony.  Yeah, no kidding.  You just quote one with a game.  I couldn't believe it.  In another minute, we'll let him go.  Anthony would have said, by any means necessary.  You'll see me at 3 o'clock.  I'll be outside the 59th Street Bridge with my good friend, Reverend Al.  Where's Anthony?  I don't know.  He's singing Wade in the Water.  We shall overcome by the Midtown Tunnel.  Holding a candle somewhere.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:41:30]  Tim Jersey, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Jimmy, I think you're right on.  If the cops are going to beat these savages out in the open, they need to at least drag  out the 8 Bells death pen.  Oh, my God.  The 8 Bells death pen.  The tent.  I know it's horrible, but I can't get enough of the sounds of 8 Bells dying that we did  yesterday and the day before on this video.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.  That was it, boys.  Oh, my God.  Drag out the tent. 
[00:42:00]  Drag out the tent.  You see the police just pop the trunk open, start setting the tent up, and then shenanigans  ensue under the big top.  They're building the tent around, and all of a sudden, all these cops are walking in, and  the helicopters are just filming the top of the tent.  We don't know what's going on in there.  They're walking out, shaking their fists, and their hands hurt.  Wiping off their nightsticks.  Oh, God.  We'll do some more 8 Bells jokes later.  Yeah, I mean, it's hard. 
[00:42:30]  Look, it's easy to say cops shouldn't use any...  Maybe they are too brutal sometimes, but it's like when cops are getting shot in Philly,  man, it's...  I mean, that's brutal when you see your fellow officers getting just clipped to not react  violently.  Everybody expects police officers who are just human, they're just guys, you know, to  act in a supernatural way with zero emotion when their fellow officers are being shot and  killed, and they expect them to just kind of... 
[00:43:00]  I know it's part of their job is to remain calm, cool, and professional, but these are  guys, just guys that are going out there, and you don't know if you're going to be killed  or not, and then you're put in a situation where you got a couple of guys, maybe fits  a description of one of the killers, they get a little heavy-handed on them.  I understand, you know, how that could happen.  It's not...  Obviously, it's not the right thing.  It's not what they're supposed to do.  But, uh, you understand how it happens. 
[00:43:30]  Holla.  Holla.  Probably heard a great bit about that.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, about that, because white people know cops differently, about how we don't...  Oh, right, yeah.  What do you do?  Yep, yeah.  Officer Dempsey.  And he used a great bit about how we know police...  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, it's very hard to put yourself in that position and judge police officers and  look at them in the same light, I guess, than a law-abiding young black man, because  obviously, like I said, that's got to suck. 
[00:44:00]  But I think a lot of the blame has to lie in your own community and with your own people,  your own young black people that are committing a bunch of crimes.  And that's why the police are doing what they're doing.  What do you think?  They'd go after black people just for the hell of it.  Young black men.  Let me just do this.  I've got to pick a race and an age and a profile.  I'll pick young black men.  They're being shot at by young black men.  I mean, that's the majority of the crime that they're seeing in major cities. 
[00:44:30]  Young black men.  It's part of the problem.  That's the problem.  That's why if you're a law-abiding young black man, you shouldn't blame the police as  much as you should the people that you know in your community that are committing these  crimes and ruining your image.  Well, it's like Anthony's fond of saying, until this stops happening in every village and every  hamlet.  Yeah, what is up with you, man? 
[00:45:00]  We've got to take a break.  We're running late.  Phone number is 877-212-018.  We're going to go to break with this here.  We're going to come back, and Anthony may not get there with us.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony's top song of the day.  Leona Lewis.  Bleeding love.  But I don't care what they say.  I'm in love with you.  They try to pull me away.  But they don't know the truth. 
[00:45:30]  My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing.  You cut me open, and I keep bleeding.  Keep, keep bleeding, love.  I keep bleeding.  I keep, keep bleeding, love.  Keep bleeding.  I keep, keep bleeding, love.  You cut me open, and...  Open and... 
[00:46:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  What's going on in the world?  Well, the Baskin-Robbins co-founder died.  Looks like God needed some ice cream.  That old gag.  It's an old radio bit, but when someone like the Baskin-Robbins co-founder dies,  like morning zoos would go, do you think he's going to be buried in a coffin 
[00:46:30]  in the shape of an ice cream cone?  How old?  That one, that goes back.  How old is he?  Oh, 90.  90?  So I guess, you know, I guess ice cream is good for you.  In 1945, he started that company.  Talk to the mic, please.  In 1945, he started that company.  Was it Baskin or Robbins?  He was Robbins.  He was Robbins.  And they flipped a coin to see the name. 
[00:47:00]  It could have been Robbins and Baskin, but then I don't think it would have hit that big.  Because his brother-in-law, he took his brother-in-law.  It's the only story I read today.  Oh, you read a story?  I'm wondering, like, how he's just going off on this and has this knowledge and wisdom  about Baskin-Robbins.  The beauty of Rich Voss, all hell is breaking loose around America,  and he decides he needs to read one story about the Baskin-Robbins guy.  About the ice cream guy.  Over a thousand flavors, not 31.  Well, great.  Also, Celtics beat the Cavs last night. 
[00:47:30]  LeBron James, did you see that coming, Anthony, last night?  Oh, my God.  That whole thing?  Yeah.  With LeBron, right?  Yeah.  What happened with LeBron last night?  Yeah, that was amazing to see.  And after the Celtics won, they all went out for ice cream to Baskin-Robbins.  LeBron James had a horrible night, and the Celtics beat the Cavs 76-72.  Kobe Bryant wins his first MVP.  Yeah.  And police announced final show in New York City.  Oh, yeah?  That's it?  Yeah, today.  They're done with their tour? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, oh, oh, the band.  I was thinking the NYPD.  Oh, no.  Announced their final show in New York City today.  Oh, this is the band, the police.  Oh.  Not their final show.  My bad.  I thought it was the NYPD's final show.  They've had it after today's demonstrations.  I'm sure they have.  This is our final show.  Their final beating.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, boy.  I don't envy them today.  And then you got what?  Obama winning North Carolina.  He had a huge lead there. 
[00:48:30]  That's no surprise.  Lost Indiana, I guess, but it was really close.  Yeah.  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  And this, I know you're not a big Obama fan, but do you agree that Hillary should drop  out and do what's right for the Democratic Party at this point?  Yeah, I think she has to.  But she refuses to.  Yeah.  She refuses to drop out of this race.  And everyone is saying it is impossible for her to win the nomination at this point.  I think this is detrimental to the party. 
[00:49:00]  She should just back out.  Give it to Obama.  Let him run.  You know what the conspiracy theory is, right?  What?  That she's staying in, hurting her party.  McCain will get the nomination and become, I mean, he'll become the President of the  United States.  He'll only do four years because he's old.  And then she has another shot at it in four years.  Wow.  That's the conspiracy theory on this whole thing.  I don't think Obama's going to go for it in four more years?  Yeah.  He's a young guy.  She'll just battle it out with him again in four years.  Yeah.  But what's the chance in four years, Obama has a better chance of going to prison than 
[00:49:30]  she does.  You know what I'm saying?  No.  Obama, this is his year.  Okay.  I'll give it to you.  This is his year because he's got this weird thing.  Nobody saw him coming.  And that's why the Clintons hate him because all of a sudden he didn't exist X amount of  years ago publicly.  Like, you'd known who he was except in stupid Chicago.  And all of a sudden he makes one speech and now he's the front runner.  Everyone just, like, yeah, loves him.  They probably saw everybody else coming.  Like, all right, we got this one, this one, this one, this one.  And all of a sudden this new guy is coming. 
[00:50:00]  He's charismatic.  But four more years he won't catch people off guard the way he is now.  And I mean in a good way.  Like, he's just kind of people just getting swept up in it.  Yeah.  Once, four more years, four more years of decisions and seeing his face.  I didn't like when he made that decision.  I didn't like when he did that.  Yeah, there's something to be said for the fact that he's inexperienced because he doesn't  have a track record that people could really go after.  And the change thing won't be as effective in four years.  Why would the media, why would all the news that were so pro-Clinton and loved Bill Clinton  and Hillary just completely jump off their bandwagon? 
[00:50:30]  They never loved Hillary.  Well, they definitely loved Bill.  And they completely jumped off to Clinton.  Not completely.  Bill Clinton came out yesterday, I think, and said that Hillary would make a better president  than he was.  That he said that.  Oh, God.  She's making him say stuff like that now.  Oh, he's pulling out all the tricks at this point.  Poor bastard.  Tim Russert, everyone.  Why?  Because she doesn't like fat chicks?  What?  What happened?  Because she doesn't like fat chicks?  Mitch, that's just hurtful.  Yeah.  Tim Russert. 
[00:51:00]  Let me start you with the same simple question.  Did it just end tonight?  We now know who the Democratic nominee is going to be, and no one's going to dispute it, Keith.  You know, sometimes in campaigns, the candidate is the last to recognize the best timing.  It's very much like being on life support.  Once they start removing the systems, you really have no choice.  It's very obvious, but she just refuses to bail.  She won't give up. 
[00:51:30]  Senator Clinton has canceled her TV appearances, canceled her public appearances.  She has some real soul-searching to do.  And those closest to her will give them a hard-headed analysis.  And if they lay it all out, they'll say, what is the rationale?  What do we say to the undeclared superdelegates tomorrow?  Why do we tell them you're staying in the race?  And tonight, there's no good answer for that.  All right, I was a little off on this.  I heard this differently because I heard some of her speeches last night.  But if she's canceling some of her appearances and stuff, she's really going to do some thinking, obviously. 
[00:52:00]  Maybe she's going to, yeah, come up with a speech, a concession speech, say she's withdrawing.  We had a tour of the White House two weeks ago, the West Wing.  Did you?  A Secret Service guy took us on a personal tour through the West Wing, showed us where Clinton banged her.  In the Oval Office?  It wasn't in the Oval Office.  It was like a little room right next to it, like right behind it.  Took you into that room? 
[00:52:30]  I was hoping he would.  He was Secret Service.  Was he cute?  He gave me a coin, too, a Secret Service coin.  How old are you?  Are you 12?  Did he give you a lollipop because you didn't cry during the dentist examination?  Shut up.  Did you get pilot wings on the flight home?  Yeah.  Fairy?  He gave me a coin.  He gave me a Secret Service coin.  That's wonderful.  I probably tried to spend it.  Yeah.  Hey, wait.  Did you get to go in the Oval Office?  You can go in because you can stand and put your head in it.  As close as you get.  It's impossible to walk in.  No one goes into the Oval Office. 
[00:53:00]  Why?  I mean, do they rope it off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's roped off.  To get a tour of just the East Wing, you've got to go through your congressman.  Would they tell you there was a penny in the corner and you went crazy?  That's what you got?  That's an Oval Office.  It's funny.  Oh, I get it.  Do you?  Do you really get it?  I actually didn't get that.  I knew it was a Jewish joke, but that was a damn good one.  Wait.  It's such an old hack joke. 
[00:53:30]  Jesus.  For sure, Voss would know it.  But wait.  The East Wing or the West Wing is harder to get the tour of?  The West Wing is harder.  Okay.  It's almost, yeah.  The East Wing, you've got to go through a congressman.  You can't.  I thought you'd just come sign up for a tour like every other place.  There's no terrorist or anything to do that.  Yeah.  Let me come in.  Yeah.  I'm just online for a tour.  Yeah.  So you've got to look at the Oval Office.  Yeah.  But they have a rope in front of it?  Yeah, it's roped off.  And I mean, we stood where they have the press conferences, you know, with the altar or whatever. 
[00:54:00]  The altar.  The podium.  The podium.  The podium right there.  Yeah, the president has a press conference.  Although with Bush, it could be called an altar sometimes.  Jesus.  Babble.  Good point.  They show where they walk, where you can't.  Like, if you look at the White House.  This is the worst description of a White House tour.  They show where they walk.  No, wait.  Hold on.  It's as if a child is writing a report.  This is my day at the White House. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And it's like you're reading it verbatim from a small child.  This is show and tell.  It's that yellow thin paper with the wood pulp in it, written with pencil.  That's what this is.  Oh, I'm trying.  I went to the White House.  It was fun.  I saw the Oval Office and the thing that they talked to at the press thing.  Relax.  The man gave me a coin.  I was going to bring it in.  I was happy.  The end.  And he wants us to relax. 
[00:55:00]  We're trying to entertain a million people.  Your grandson, Frank.  How about you get your thoughts together before you get in here?  Okay.  Well, I'm trying to talk.  They showed us where the people walk.  What does that mean?  You know, I'm saying when the president walks, like if you're in the front of you, if you're  out on the street and you're looking at the White House and you're looking at the lawn,  it drops down where he walks by the aisle.  I can't explain what I'm trying to say.  Just stop.  I'm just saying it was a good tour.  I can't explain what I'm trying to say. 
[00:55:30]  It was a lot of fun.  You talk for a living.  And then he just goes, it was a lot of fun.  I know, but I get a little overexcited on stuff.  And it was three weeks ago, so I forgot a lot.  The boyish excitement is actually overwhelming his ability to convince us.  Yes.  I forgot a lot of stuff from three weeks ago, too.  Guess what?  I don't bring it up.  Yeah.  But the man, the president man was there.  51, Rich.  When he walks out, like I didn't understand.  All I understood was a nice man gave him a coin.  That's all I really understood.  I'll bring it in next time. 
[00:56:00]  We're trying to get info from a mosquito.  My friend, my buddy Ken used to do helicopter duty when the president would walk off.  He was one of the ... I met him in ...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he told me he would get me a tour of the West Wing, but you have to go through a security  clearance first to get a tour.  Yeah.  Well, they just take your name and social security.  The guy who gave me the tour met you and offered you the tour, but you blew him off.  No, I didn't.  I'm never in D.C.  He met you.  He met you and Kenny.  And Kenny must ... I'm telling you, he met you and said, do you want a tour or something? 
[00:56:30]  And you probably, you know, whatever.  We're busy or ...  Do you have his number?  I got his email.  Are you okay, Rich?  I'll call Rich.  What's wrong?  I'm saying the guy met him.  How else do you say it like that?  He met him and Norton blew him off.  I didn't blow him off.  I might not have been able to.  Don't make it look like I'm blowing off secret service agents.  I'm not that fancy.  Yeah.  Norton, knowing ... We all know Norton.  He would never blow off secret service.  No.  Not an opportunity like that.  That would be something Jimmy would really get into.  Photos?  Right.  Please.  Jesse in New Jersey. 
[00:57:00]  Jesse.  Good morning, buh, buh, buh, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, Rich.  Did you have your sexy shorts on when you went there to get the coin?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yes.  The president wasn't there.  Oh, really?  No.  Because everyone thought you might be just hanging with the president.  Yeah.  Well, he said, when the president gets off the helicopter, I can come see that.  What?  The helicopter?  When a helicopter lands.  And sit in the pilot seat and wear the pilot's hat?  The whirlybird.  The whirlybird.  Richard, Rich, hold my hand.  I'll get you through this break. 
[00:57:30]  Just hold my hand.  We'll get through this.  Oh, my God.  He's so excited.  He really is.  We finally have somebody that got a tour of the White House, and we get no info on it.  And we got nothing from him.  Absolutely nothing.  I'd like to know what's going on in there.  Yeah.  Like, what's...  Well, there was a lot of Norman Rockwell paintings that are worth, like, tons of money, and there  was...  Hold on.  All right.  Explain one Norman Rockwell painting that you saw in the White House.  There was one Norman Rockwell of the Statue of Liberty, right?  Yeah.  Okay?  And he kind of messed up, and he turned it over and redid it. 
[00:58:00]  So on the back of this Norman Rockwell is a screwed-up Statue of Liberty, and it's even  worth a lot more money now because he messed up.  So there's one Norman Rockwell.  Can you see it from both sides, or do they actually have it hanging on a wall, or is it  displayed?  Yeah, it's in an aquarium in a glass wall.  It's in a frame, stupid.  Can you see it from both sides here with 3D glasses?  You can.  But they could have displayed it a certain way, so you said that.  Come on, you didn't attack him for that.  No.  If I would have just said that.  But I understood what he said. 
[00:58:30]  If it's screwed up, why wouldn't you show that?  Like, because you're...  Because it's the White House, not the Salvador Dali Museum.  It's the White House.  The what?  The what?  The what museum?  The what?  Salvador Dali.  Oh, okay.  It was Salm...  You said...  It's a Salvador Dali.  Salmonor.  No, you combine an artist and some type of food poisoning.  Salmonella, Dali.  I was saying maybe they displayed it a certain way, so you could see the back if the arrow  is a big...  How do you know that that exists?  The Secret Service Guy told me. 
[00:59:00]  He knows everything.  Do you believe anything he told you?  He knew almost everything.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be a gag he plays on people.  No, it's not.  You know the back of this.  There's a screwed up version on the back.  Well, why would he say that at all the pictures?  Why wouldn't they display it so you can see both sides?  In a glass case where you can walk around the back.  I don't know.  All right.  That's a good answer.  Because I don't know.  That's a great answer right there.  Well, why wouldn't they...  That's a wonderful answer.  What goes on in the White House?  You're walking around.  What goes on?  There's a lot of decisions made.  Okay.  Maybe I should have been a little more specific. 
[00:59:30]  You should have never graduated from the third grade.  You know that, right?  Also, they showed us where the big screen is.  A lot of decisions are made in the White House.  The big screen where the president will talk to astronauts and stuff.  And how old are you?  I'm telling you what I saw.  A little child.  You talk to astronauts.  Dude, my 10-year-old nephews are smarter than you.  No.  You get a better description than the big screen where he talks to astronauts.  I'm not a profiler.  Talks to spacemen. 
[01:00:00]  You're not a profiler.  What does that mean?  I don't remember everything from the tour.  So that makes you not a profiler?  Well, because they remember everything.  Dude, I don't really...  I walked around New York yesterday.  I don't really remember what I saw.  But if I went to the White House, I think I'd remember a lot of things.  Yeah.  That's like a once-in-a-lifetime thing to do.  Talk about it.  I can do it again.  The guy will take me again.  Well, you might need to go there a few times just to get some of this stuff in your body.  The guy will take me again.  The guy.  It's like holding his hand, leading him through. 
[01:00:30]  You've remembered nothing.  You said, well, they showed me where he banged a girl, and they show where he walked.  Some gun closets.  And you look in the room.  Yeah, they have gun closets in the White House.  You don't think they have gun closets in the White House?  I don't want to mind.  Actual gun closets?  Yeah, where they keep, you know, like...  Guns?  And rifles and stuff, and M6, whatever, you know, in case someone, boom, open the door,  a gun closet.  I saw a gun closet, and you can't even tell it's a closet. 
[01:01:00]  Boom, hit the wall.  Wall opens, guns.  Really?  Guns are in there.  Listen to me.  Wow.  Also...  I'm trying to figure this out.  I mean, Rich is a bit older, but he's not old enough to have Alzheimer's right now.  I don't think so, not yet.  A lot of things I do.  Anyway.  Something's going on with you.  Nothing's going on.  I'm trying to...  Dude, this is what you would hear if you went to a fifth grade class.  Well, okay.  Then have Jeff Foxworthy introduce me.  What I'm saying, too, we also saw a Congress. 
[01:01:30]  The people have...  Oh, my God.  I hope you have...  The people have what, Rich?  Let me tell you what happens with a morning show.  Between 7 and 7.30 is our biggest audience.  This is when we have to really hit them with material.  And you just went, Congress, where the people...  Ugh.  What happened?  Your brain exploded.  Let's move on.  Can I point out something that Erock pointed out brilliantly?  It was that Walls remembered more about Basking Robbins than the White House. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  And that's good that you spelled it Basking Robbins.  Basking Robbins.  B-A-S-K-I-N-G.  Too busy shoving it in his mouth to read the outside of the label, damn it.  That's right.  To eat the...  Oh, my God.  I was so eager to get that little insult out.  Basking Robbins.  Basking.  A fool.  Let's say hi to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve.  Hey, Voss.  What's up?  Hey, you know, you're adding nothing to the show.  This is pure humor. 
[01:02:30]  Please go home.  This is funny.  Please go home.  Hey, to the boys in the office, we should do...  I think this is a great idea.  We should do, are you smarter than Voss again?  We like to do this from time to time.  But let's do kind of like, not even history questions.  I think government questions.  He was at the White House.  So those basic White House, Congress type of questions.  Basic Washington questions.  Because you had a nice tour down there.  And we'll see if you can answer some of the questions.  All right, Rich?  Not today, though.  Yes, today.  You shouldn't have to study for that. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  Can we get some of that together really fast?  Like five or six questions for Rich Voss, Dan?  No problem.  To answer?  Let's see.  Let's go to Talon, the trucker.  What are you hauling, Talon?  Probably diapers and paper products.  You don't even know, really?  Probably.  Well, it's a Procter & Gamble product.  I really don't care what's in the bill as long as it's legal weight. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Very nice.  What do you got?  Uh, Voss, you said you were at the West Wing.  You sure you were in the White House or not the TV studio there getting a tour by an extra?  By an extra.  Joe in Georgia.  Joe.  Hey, we got dummy Voss over there talking about the painting that was messed up on the back.  Yeah.  And, uh, Jimmy said, did you see the back of it?  And he said, no, I didn't have 3D glasses.  Yeah.  They're stupid.  They're x-ray glasses.  Well, Joe, you know what I'm saying.  That's right.  3D. 
[01:04:00]  Life is 3D.  Come on.  Any glasses or 3D glasses?  Good point.  Good point.  3D glasses.  Good point.  Let's say hi.  That was a great point.  I couldn't see the ship when I was looking at the picture.  Yeah.  Secret Service man told me, look for a long time.  If you stare at it, you'll see the 3D ship.  My daddy figure told me to look at the painting.  I got a coin.  Did you see the painting?  No.  He told me to shake up the globe and the snow would fall on it.  Yeah.  Nothing?  I like it. 
[01:04:30]  Thank you.  Rich in Michigan, what's up?  Hey, I think all the memories of whatever Voss saw might be dodging him.  Yeah.  Can we break out the 8 Bells death tent today for Rich Voss?  The what?  Oh.  He broke his legs.  Who's 8 Bells?  Who's 8 Bells?  8 Bells.  Who's 8 Bells?  Mr. Baskin Robbins.  Yeah, you know all about Baskin Robbins.  Who is 8 Bells?  This is something anyone should know. 
[01:05:00]  Anyone?  Yeah.  Anyone should know.  Look at Rich.  Getting hold of him.  He's so boggled.  He was right in that space.  Anyone?  Yeah, pretty much anyone.  8 Bells?  8 Bells.  Put it this way.  You're like the back part of 8 Bells.  I have no idea.  I got to admit, I don't know this one.  8 Bells.  You don't know what that means.  It's probably some Catholic stuff.  8 Bells.  You share her teeth. 
[01:05:30]  8 Bells.  Oh, a horse.  Oh, God.  Oh, the horse.  Oh, God.  Is that the one that fell and got her legs?  Oh, really?  And got her legs what?  She got, you know, euthanized.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  You got the word right and everything.  I can't believe that just happened.  Oh, damn.  Rich is like, wow.  That was good.  Very nice.  Yeah.  All right.  You can't blame the jockey.  You can't blame the jockey for the meltdown of a horse.  All right.  Now he's cooking.  Look at him.  I knew the horse. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, you didn't?  You knew the horse.  We had to make horse jokes for you to figure it out.  Yeah.  It didn't hit me.  Jimmy did the horse's ass joke.  You said 8 Bells and then Baskin-Robbins.  What does 8 Bells have to do with Baskin-Robbins?  Well, if you were listening closely, nothing.  And we didn't try to make the two things connected.  Oh.  That's pretty good.  Phone number 877-212-018.  When we get back, we got a great story about an Air France pilot.  Wait till you hear this one.  Yeah.  And we go to break with a little history lesson from Rich Voss. 
[01:06:30]  The History Channel and Jimmy Dean Sausage Links with a grant from the Picket Fence Dental  Corporation present 20th Century American History with renowned scholar and member of Mensa,  Rich Voss.  I know a lot about it.  Dr. Voss will take you on a breathtaking journey through history's most poignant milestones.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962?  The Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God.  With every outburst, Rich Voss gets dumber and dumber.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when...  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  Your head will spin.  Who was the U.S. president when World War II ended?  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs.  That didn't actually end World War II.  You've never met a Jew who knows less about World War II than Rich Voss. 
[01:07:30]  What was the World War where Germany was going and taking, you know, just out of control?  By the way, I've never wanted to punch someone more than you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes.  It's pretty embarrassing when you think about it.  So tune in to 20th century American history and watch in amazement as an old Jewish man  goes from mildly coherent to babbling pile of mush in the course of an hour.  You know, you know, it's all history from there.  Coming to the History Channel.  How's everybody? 
[01:08:00]  That's good.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's not forget about onaradio.com.  Stephen S. from Bayshore does the fine rundowns, the show rundowns.  Yes.  He's got a lot of fans of his rundowns.  onaradio.com.  Also, we put all the visuals that we talk about up there in one nice place that you can go to.  Let's say hi to Michelle in New Jersey.  We got Rich Voss in the studio.  Michelle, what's up? 
[01:08:30]  Well, I've been on hold for two weeks, so I really can't remember everything.  But I think it had to do with an oval gun.  Being stupid.  Stupid.  I think she's trying to make fun of Rich, and her phone is petering out.  She sounds like a Bingham, so I think she's eating in between.  She sounds just like Rich.  Bingham?  A Bingham.  Don, Niagara Falls, what's going on?  Oh, not much.  Hey, Rich Voss is boring. 
[01:09:00]  I saw how even when he's reading a pamphlet from a tour that he never went on.  I didn't hear that one either.  Yeah, I just like the pamphlet part.  We're just reading a pamphlet.  Yo, O&A, you guys finally coming to Buffalo?  We're trying to get the virus tour up there in Buffalo, but we don't know what's going on.  I think there's some behind-the-scenes things going on with our Buffalo deal I'm hearing.  I don't know.  Maybe you should start calling the edge. 
[01:09:30]  Maybe all our fans should start calling the edge and say,  Hey, is Opie and Anthony coming to Buffalo for the O&A?  Yeah, are we?  We need to book this thing.  Darien Lake, I know that place well.  We could get people from Canada.  We could get people from Cleveland.  We could get people from Rochester.  That would be a nice little hub for the O&A fans.  What?  I don't know why we don't do it.  Why don't we just book it?  Morgan, Jimmy.  I'm going to have to get on the phone with some people and find out what the hell is going on.  I'm going to the casino.  Hang out with the big ones.  You can party with them.  Man, we'll love you.  Okay.  All right, Don.  Thank you. 
[01:10:00]  Somebody.  All right, man.  Bring it.  Bring it.  Bring it on.  Let's say hi to Dom in New Jersey.  Dom, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hit it, Dom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Welcome aboard.  I just wanted to say we need a lot less Voss and a lot more Club Soda Kenny with Traffic  on the 8th.  Why are you yelling but being mean to Voss?  Yeah, I bring nothing but humor to this.  Are you kidding?  I'm a no-fail comic.  I wake up to you guys every morning, and when I first woke up to Club Soda Kenny doing 
[01:10:30]  Traffic on the 8th, I was in tears.  It was so funny.  We all were.  Well, but here's the thing.  It is very funny, but there's no reason to slam me to build him up.  That's right.  We're two separate entities.  That's right.  Just because Voss has humor, like a 60-year-old.  Okay.  I mean, if you were at Brokerage this weekend, you would hear how funny I am on stage.  I mean, there's no reason to attack me like that.  Brokerage what?  At Belmore?  Yeah.  Long Island?  Yeah, this weekend.  Rich Voss is hilarious on a stage, man.  And very funny on the radio, too, I must say, but in a different way. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Excuse him.  Oh, my God.  Brokeragecomedy.com to book your tickets to see Rich Voss.  And you are very funny, but beat it.  Kenny needs your mic.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Traffic and weather on the 8th.  With Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  Good morning, everyone.  It's that time again for the Opie and Anthony traffic and weather on the 8th with me, Club 
[01:11:30]  Soda Kenny.  The streets are running red in Jersey this morning.  A lot of hubbub in Tom's River.  Route 37 westbound near Hospital Drive is closed because some schmuck thought it would be a good  idea to drive full speed into a traffic light, which closed the entire highway.  I think he'll be trading his car for a wheelchair. 
[01:12:00]  He's so happy, too.  You know, I'm enthusiastic.  Yeah.  You know, this is a morning show.  We got to get people get up and going.  Pandemonium in Lakewood, New Jersey.  East County Line Road between Somerset Avenue and Brook Road is closed because some broad  decided to play chicken with a telephone pole.  Guess who won?  She won't be needing any Mother's Day presents.  Oh, my. 
[01:12:30]  Kenny.  Kenny.  The family can save money.  It's economical.  And the only thing that would make that accident better is if the pole fell on some people and  hammered them into the ground like dumb tacks.  Did you say dumb tacks?  You're a dumb tack.  I don't enunciate well.  Almost like Rich.  Almost.  But anyway, speaking of Lakewood, New Jersey, all right?  Mayhem.  Yesterday, 1937, the Hindenburg burst into flames. 
[01:13:00]  You talk about catastrophes.  Killing 36 unlucky people.  Shouldn't we have done that news yesterday?  Well, I'm very punctual.  You're not.  No, you're not.  That's the point.  You're late by 24 hours.  Yeah.  I got bumped by that, you know, magician yesterday.  Oh, okay.  That would be Penn Jillette.  Yeah.  You're mad that you got bumped?  No, he's a good guy.  We were supposed to do this yesterday. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, that was Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Hindenburg.  Yeah, yesterday, 1937.  Go figure.  Basically, you're 70 years late on that report.  It's not affecting traffic today.  It's not.  It's the anniversary.  Yesterday was the anniversary.  How does it affect traffic?  Well, he likes death and destruction, so he's got a little look at history.  Mayhem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of hullabaloo.  Yeah, we got it.  We got it the first time you said hullabaloo.  No, I said hubbub.  Hubbub.  Oh, hubbub. 
[01:14:00]  I'm sorry.  You know.  My bad.  I got to sprinkle in, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kinneisms.  The Grim Reaper continues his morning tour of the Garden State.  In Wayne, New Jersey, Route 80 eastbound near exit 53, there's an accident on the exit ramp  and another accident in the local lanes.  The idiot in the local lanes was too busy rubbernecking and looking at the dead and mangled body on the exit ramp  and plowed full speed into a gas truck. 
[01:14:30]  Two words.  Crispy carnage.  What the hell?  Now, let's shift gears and do some weather.  Yeah, let's do that.  You know, this is a good story.  You're really going to like this one.  You probably didn't notice.  You probably ain't going to believe it either.  Right.  Volcanic gases are adversely affecting Hawaii's air quality.  There's a lot of vog. 
[01:15:00]  You know, volcanic smog, which reduces visibility and causes respiratory problems.  So, if you like hula dancing and sunshine, you get the tuberculosis to go with it.  And then, this is terrific.  Flooding and tornadoes are menacing the midsection of the U.S.  After last week's deadly tornadoes, parts of Arkansas, or Arkansas some people say, 
[01:15:30]  and nobody cares about Arkansas,  uh, well, uh, uh, they're going to have severe thunderstorms today and tonight,  and heavy rain could produce flash floods from Oklahoma to Illinois.  So, batten down your trailers, farmers, or maybe you could float away on your corn.  This has been the traffic and weather with Club Soda Kenny  on the world's renowned Opie and Anthony morning show.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Wow.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  That was very, uh, in-depth and insightful. 
[01:16:00]  Sure.  Uh, John.  Helped out with the traffic.  John, what do you got?  Yeah, uh, what's it called?  Club Soda Kenny.  I don't know who wrote your, uh, report there.  It might have been involved because, uh, the Ginderberg crash in Lakehurst, New Jersey,  not Lakewood, New Jersey.  Yeah, I know.  When I said Lakehurst, I was like, wait a minute.  I don't think he said Lakehurst.  Well, he gets a few things wrong, but, you know, you get the point.  Yeah.  He's trying to inform you.  Uh, do we have time?  It's a quickie.  We got to do one of, uh, Club Soda Kenny's, uh, phone scams. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Or phone slams.  His phone slam scam, whatever the hell they call it.  Yeah, because, you know, Z100 here in New York is the number one morning show in America.  Yeah.  In, uh, in America.  In, uh, New York.  We don't understand why.  So we're, we're, we're trying to do a few of their, their bits on our show.  And, uh, Kenny does phone slams now for us.  Here's one of his latest.  Oakley and Anthony's phone slam with Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, is this Ray?  Yeah.  Ray, your family's dead. 
[01:17:00]  What?  Remember that faulty propane tank in your backyard?  No.  Well, it blew the house up.  What?  They're all dead.  Oh, my God.  You've just been phone slammed.  Who is this?  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  We need a new one.  He is an ass.  I like that a lot.  You gotta love Kenny.  Yeah.  Hey, we got an idiotic Air France pilot. 
[01:17:30]  Listen to this one.  A pilot showing off to a young boy in his cockpit.  Oh, dear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, showing off the cockpit, dear boy.  Yeah, yeah.  Come here.  I'll show you the controls, young William.  Oh, dear.  Anytime, New York.  Anytime.  That's okay.  Screw it, Iraq.  Don't need that.  Yeah, it doesn't really help the bit whatsoever.  I'm done.  Let's go ahead.  A pilot showing off to a young boy in his cockpit ended up almost crashing the airliner.  You ever seen a grown man naked? 
[01:18:00]  Passengers said the pilot deliberately rocked the jet from side to side as he showed the  child how the controls work.  You like movies about gladiators.  So you got the pilot, you got the kid, and he's like, well, look, look what I can do  with the controls.  Yeah, you move this, and you'll rock back and forth.  Right.  And meanwhile, the people in the back are going, well, what's happening?  A little turbulence.  What's going on?  Moments later, however, he was forced to throw the Air France plane into a steep climb to  get out of the way of another aircraft.  Oops. 
[01:18:30]  He was a little distracted by a 13-year-old boy in the cockpit and had to climb out.  I guess he was on a collision course with another plane.  Yeah.  And they said there were screaming and prayers heard in the passenger compartment.  Witnesses said terrified passengers blessed themselves and said prayers aloud as the plane  soared 10,000 feet.  You never want to be a terrified passenger.  I've noticed that.  You just never want to be part of the terrified passengers.  It's never good. 
[01:19:00]  The drama happened on an Airbus A320, which was carrying 143 passengers to Paris from Manchester,  England, passenger Sean Robinson, 40, an IT website manager from Rosendale, said the  pilot had clearly been showing off to the boy who was about 13 years old.  Showing off?  Why?  Did he think that kid got a coin?  Young rich.  I was horrified by what I saw, he said.  The pilot made a sharp turn to the left without warning and then back again, obviously showing 
[01:19:30]  the young French boy how he flew his plane.  I could see the boy.  He shook hands with the pilots.  Moments later, however, there was an emergency as passengers said they heard alarm noises coming  from the cockpit.  Mr. Robinson said the pilot threw...  It's Mr. Robinson, too, huh?  The pilot threw his plane into a steep climb.  The two crew members sitting in front of me had terror written across their faces and were  gripping their chairs.  Why would they write that?  When it was all over, the pilot said he had climbed 10,000 feet. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, man.  To avoid this other plane.  He said air traffic control had come on the radio and said, climb, climb, climb, 10,000  feet.  This is young Rich Voss.  This is the cockpit.  I'm going to give you a little coin and some wings.  That's nice.  No, not chicken wings, though.  That's going to your chest.  Let's rock the plane back and forth a little bit.  And don't touch that, Rich.  Don't touch that young Richie. 
[01:20:30]  Little Richie.  Sit down.  No, your hands have little gummy bear sticky on them.  Don't touch the instruments.  Thank you.  Please.  A little retarded child.  That's why he shook the plane so the kid would fall on him.  Hey, right on, man.  Yeah, air traffic control.  Climb, climb, climb.  10,000 feet.  You're going to hit a plane.  It was terrifying.  People were blessing themselves.  Clearly something happened.  Perhaps the pilot lost concentration and took his eye off the ball. 
[01:21:00]  Take your own joke there, people.  Took his eye off the ball, huh?  Take your own joke there.  Yep.  We'll keep out of that one.  So, Voss, you took a tour of the White House.  We got some very basic questions about our government.  Yes.  You took a tour of the White House and Congress.  What do you mean?  Didn't you mention Congress, too?  No.  You mean the state capitol? 
[01:21:30]  Huh?  State capitol?  Oh, my God.  State capitol.  Where does Congress meet?  The state capitol, dummy.  No, the capitol building.  Oh, whatever.  The state capitol.  The state capitol would be Albany.  Okay.  Right.  Or here.  But you know what I mean.  The capitol building.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where Congress meets.  Yes.  All right.  So, you know, you did this White House tour.  So, here we go.  Oh, well, you know what?  What?  You had to get a little education from it.  I would think.  You don't just walk around and look.  People tell you things like the stupid painting. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Go ahead.  How many branches of the U.S. government are there?  These are very basic questions.  I think, like, six.  Six.  Sixth graders.  Six.  Six branches?  Oh!  There's agricultural.  There's...  Hold on, man.  First of all, six is wrong.  Wow.  Hold on.  Let's see which ones he has, though.  He might be right.  All right.  You might have a few.  All right.  Go ahead.  Name the branches of the U.S. government.  Agricultural is right.  Oh, God.  I had these.  The branches of the government.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Ooh.  Mm-hmm.  I don't look.  I'm not going to help.  There's...  There's...  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, the secretary of the interior.  The interior.  So, without the interior, there's...  With the interior, there's probably the exterior, right?  Uh, and then there's, uh...  I, I, I'm...  I...  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  Uh, then there's, uh... 
[01:23:00]  Uh, defense.  You know, defense.  And then there's, uh...  Wait, who do you got so far?  Agricultural?  Yeah.  Interior, exterior, defense.  Interior, exterior, defense.  You missed one.  Uh...  Uh, judicial or...  Did you just say, uh...  Yeah, uh...  Yeah, uh...  Judicial.  Oh.  Okay, whatever.  Oh.  Oh, well, there's, uh, three branches, uh, Rich.  Oh.  What is it?  Executive.  Oh. 
[01:23:30]  Legislative.  And, um, judicial.  Oh, you didn't say judicial.  I just gave you that one.  But what was the...  Yeah, that's right.  What's the...  The interior.  What's that stuff, though?  Interior means inside.  No, I...  And I love watching this dodo bird try to be logical.  He's like, well, the exterior, interior.  But I guess you have to have the exterior, too.  Yeah.  Well, if there's an interior.  He was so happy with himself, too.  He got one.  He was segwayed right into the other.  Let's go to Matt in Missouri. 
[01:24:00]  Matt.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Matt.  But, you know, I'm a third-grade teacher.  Okay.  And, uh, we teach this stuff in third grade.  Oh, it is third grade.  Wow.  Who's going to remember that far back?  They should have, you know, punch it up.  You know what I mean?  You just go back.  What, like a booster shot of knowledge?  Yeah, whatever.  Third grade.  What do I remember in third grade?  The pilots swinging the plane back and forth, you know?  What do you remember from third grade?  Agricultural.  You said agricultural is a branch of the government.  No, I'm saying there's, you know, the departments or whatever. 
[01:24:30]  The department of the interior, the department, you know.  No, no, that's not a branch of the government.  I didn't hear it correctly.  What the hell is he talking about?  He's going through all the offices.  Maintenance.  Reception.  But what is it, you know?  Janitorial.  The department of, you know, the interior, the department of.  What's it?  Cabinets.  Those are cabinets.  Let's go to Joe in Pennsylvania.  Yeah, he's sure.  Joe, what's up? 
[01:25:00]  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, Rich, got a question for you.  What's that?  You went on a tour of the White House?  Yeah.  What color was it?  That's all you have.  Call back with something better.  All right.  He's not stupid.  Who are the first two people?  Well, you know, I don't think we should do these all in a row.  We should maybe break it up.  Yeah, well, we've only done one question so far.  All in a row.  We've done one in a row.  Who are the first two people in the presidential line of succession? 
[01:25:30]  And then someone rewrote the question to Dumb and Town for you, Rich.  Who takes over the big man in charge if something bad happens to him?  The vice president.  Then who?  Right.  And who's the vice president?  And then the secretary of state.  Who's the vice president?  Right now?  Yeah.  Keney.  Okay.  And who's the speaker?  Wait.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's either the speaker of the house.  No, what did he say?  I know I messed up.  Pelosi.  But what did he say?  Dumb, he said secretary of state.  No, I said secretary of state.  You did say secretary of state.  I messed that one up.  I didn't mean. 
[01:26:00]  I thought you meant.  Listen, Spider.  All right, Al Haig.  This is what I thought.  I thought you meant not like after the president gets shut.  I thought you meant like if they stood in line at a reception or a wedding and they shook their hands.  That's who's in line for the presidency.  See, that's what I thought.  I thought you said when they stood in line at a reception.  All right, listen.  And I want to make it perfectly clear.  He's not lying.  This is how dumb this guy is.  He's retarded.  No offense, Rich, but you are as dumb as they come.  No, I thought you meant really, really funny on the presidency. 
[01:26:30]  He makes Bob Kelly look like Dr. Cocker.  Why would we ask for how they line up at a reception?  Well, because you always see those at the governor's ball or whatever.  You know what I mean?  The governor's ball.  Everything that comes out of his mouth.  Everything.  At the reception.  What order do they stand in at the reception?  All right, listen.  But I knew it was, I knew that.  Vice President and, yeah.  Then who?  What's that?  Then who?  The Speaker of the House.  Pelosi or whatever.  All right, what are the first 10? 
[01:27:00]  Real liberal.  What are the first 10 amendments called?  The first 10 amendments?  What are they called?  What do you mean?  Oh, the first 10.  Yeah.  What do you call it?  Gosh.  The first.  The first 10.  The first 10 amendments.  Yeah.  You know, like.  Watch her start naming all the amendments. 
[01:27:30]  Mustard.  Relish.  Ketchup.  Oh, the Constitution.  What's that right?  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  I don't know that one either, actually.  The first 10 amendments?  The main ones.  They're called the main ones.  The main ones.  The top 10.  They're the top 10 amendments.  The Bill of Rights.  Oh.  Do you know these two, kind of?  I maybe would have got that one wrong.  I got that one wrong. 
[01:28:00]  I would have probably just, like, kind of.  We're doing a fundraiser for dogs, too.  For what?  For animals.  What, are they going to have you answer questions against one of them?  Me, Patrice, and a tell.  I know.  Stand up in New York tomorrow night here in New York City.  How do you know about that?  It's in the paper.  Because they had a picture of Patrice with a cute little dog in the paper on Sunday.  Oh.  How many U.S. senators are there?  What?  Oh, that's easy.  All right.  That's easy.  How many U.S. senators?  Yeah.  A hundred.  Two from each state.  Hmm.  Look at him go.  Shut us up there.  Schumer. 
[01:28:30]  Sure he did.  Should we continue?  Yeah, let's get this over with.  What rights does the Second Amendment protect?  Great to bear arms.  Oh, boy.  He's on a roll.  Now he's cooking.  How long is the term of a member of the House of Representatives?  That's a little rough.  I want to know that.  Six years.  Yep.  Two years.  Two years.  That's what I said, but two years, but if you're re-elected two more times, I knew it  was two years.  Why did I say six?  No, you didn't.  Why would I hear you say six?  Why would I say yup to anything you say? 
[01:29:00]  Is it odds on that no matter what you say, if someone goes, that's wrong?  It's going to be wrong.  Yeah, how many times do I go, let's go into that arrest area?  You go, yup.  Okay.  Good point.  Good point.  One number of presidents is George Bush.  That's a little.  That's a tough one.  That's a tough one.  Now.  I'm going to keep track.  How long is the term of a Supreme Court justice?  Wait, what number is he?  Forty-third?  Forty-third.  How long is the term of a Supreme Court justice?  As long as the president keeps him there.  It could be four or eight years. 
[01:29:30]  It depends how long the president's term is.  The Supreme Court justice?  The Supreme?  Wait.  The Supreme Court justice?  Supreme Court justice.  His term is six years.  Let's say hi to Chad in Michigan.  Chad.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Yeah.  I love you, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  I'm a little concerned about Rich.  The three signs of a stroke are incoherent babbling, slurred speech, and numbness on the side of his face. 
[01:30:00]  Rich, is your face okay?  I'm a little worried out here about you.  So you know what?  That's a good point.  Now I'm a hypochonderd.  Now I'm going to get all nervous.  Yeah, he's having a stroke.  If you're not having a stroke, you should be.  All right, well...  You know that or your kidney cyst has moved to your brain.  Why, sir?  You had us.  Oh, yeah, that's hurtful.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, one more.  We'll let you off the hook here, Rich.  What document started with, we hold these truths to be self-evident? 
[01:30:30]  $10 bill.  Now he's just blurting out denominations of money.  We hold these.  Go ahead.  He's just battling.  Yes.  What document?  Declaration of Independence.  All right.  Pretty good, right?  Yeah, not bad.  I thought he'd do a lot worse.  I think he got three, maybe four out of ten.  Pretty good for an eight-year-old.  Abysmal for a 50-year-old.  Agriculture Department.  Of course you didn't get the Supreme Court one.  Oh, yeah.  The Supreme Court one was life.  Life's an appointment. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  What do you mean?  When you're appointed, you're there until you die or retire.  Or you get fired.  What do you mean?  You don't, it's really tough to fire those guys.  Just think in terms of your own experience.  Something that's amounted to nothing.  I've got a great life.  I asked a couple questions you don't know.  No big deal.  Let's go to Kurt in Pennsylvania.  Kurt, what's up?  Hey.  I just thought this all was very informative today, this morning here with Rich.  I thought maybe you could use Voss as like a roving, traveling reporter, go to different 
[01:31:30]  places, and then he can come back and kind of fill all the, enlighten all the listeners  with his riveting details of what he's seen.  I like that.  That's a good point.  Thank you.  That's a good bit.  Well, you travel around a lot, so maybe you should find like the local place to go.  Well, when we were, that's what we did.  When we went to Philly, when we were in Philly, we were going to go to the Liberty Bell, right?  Yeah.  But instead, we drove by.  We were too lazy to get out of the car, so we drove by, and then we went back to the  hotel, and on the info channel, we listened to stuff about the Liberty Bell, and then 
[01:32:00]  when we went out at night, we told people we went to Liberty Bell, and we had all the  info on it.  Wow, so you fooled them.  What do you know about the Liberty Bell?  It's cracked.  What else?  That's all I know.  What else did you learn from the-  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  You're not even going to try?  No one's going to ever ask you these questions.  We are.  You got a lot in common with the Liberty Bell.  Crack.  You did crack for way too many years.  The Liberty Bell wore short shorts one day. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  All right.  That's all you know, though?  You're right.  You know what?  I'm going to start doing that.  When we go on the road, we're going to start going to places, and we'll do-  And it could be a good bid for our show.  You come back and tell us what you learned.  Hey, were you breastfed as a child?  What's that?  I don't remember.  Well, no, because there's a study that-  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  He's gold.  You're gold.  I don't remember.  Who remembers that?  Study shows breastfed children are smarter.  That's true.  How do you know?  Because that's what they say, and we're breastfeeding our baby.  Who are you breastfed? 
[01:33:00]  What?  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Probably by a man in his lap.  Last week.  The thin breast.  That's all the milk you have?  Oh, my God.  Oh, now there's milk in my eye.  Can you clean this milk off my back, please?  Oh, we got Bob Kelly here.  Oh, good.  Bob is a world traveler now.  Well, the reason we- 
[01:33:30]  Thank you, Than.  The reason we asked Bob Kelly to come in, he was just here Friday, but we learned that  he went to Guatemala to go relic hunting for the weekend, and Guatemala, we learned last  week, is a very, very dangerous place, and we got an update yesterday that he got sick  being in Guatemala, so we'll have Bob Kelly next to talk about his relic hunting?  Yeah, relic hunting.  I think he found my CD.  Nothing.  No, there's something.  Speaking of babies, coming to the O.P. and Anthony Show, it's the first and first 
[01:34:00]  annual baby throwing contest.  Stay tuned for details.  Moving right along with the O.P. and Anthony Show, another full house.  We got Rich Voss.  He's playing the brokerage out there on Long Island.  The Belmore of Long Island.  I went there, I remembered, back in the day, a bunch of years ago, and it seems like a 
[01:34:30]  fine place.  Rich is going to be there Friday and Saturday night, two shows both nights.  Go to brokeragecomedy.com to see Rich Voss.  Yeah, they fixed up the club.  It's really nice now.  New owners and everything.  Very, very cool.  Also, we got a brand new phone slam from Club Soda Kenny coming up in minutes.  We just previewed it, and it made us laugh really, really hard.  But first, we got to say hi to the world traveler, Mr. Robert Kelly. 
[01:35:00]  Yes.  Bobby filled in for Jimmy on Friday.  Yes.  And we learned that you were going to Guatemala.  Yes.  To do some relic hunting.  Yes.  For the weekend.  For the weekend.  Jimmy was all over you yesterday, like, why would you do this?  He's absolutely right.  I gave you a beating yesterday.  Oh, you should have.  I wish you gave it to me on Friday. 
[01:35:30]  Did you bring your wife?  Did you bring your wife?  Are you out of your mind?  Yeah, why would you do that?  That's where you met her.  Guatemala.  That's where I met her.  Did you just crack on my wife?  No, it was you.  Wow, what's that about?  Is that how you're going now?  You're a dude wife?  Listen.  That's what I like about her.  Can't argue with that, homo.  Wow.  It's all right.  Keep coming.  So, all right, Bob.  You decided.  Why did you decide to go?  I miss that. 
[01:36:00]  You know, every time we used to go to Brazil for relic hunting.  For another type of hunting.  It was a little different.  Trying to find one girl with self-esteem.  And they would try to find one guy with self-esteem.  You know, I always, I don't know, I was just interested in, you know, the favelas and all that stuff.  We went one block, that's it.  The favelas, the slums.  Oh, okay.  They call them the favelas, the virgal, as Patrice would say.  And then go into a tirade about it for 20 minutes. 
[01:36:30]  I just like that stuff, man.  And I went with this guy who, like, goes there and does all this, you know, goes into the Mayan temples, the apocalypto type stuff, and goes into these little villages.  And he lived there for, like, three years.  He, you know, he's been through, like, he's been pulled over and had, you know, AKs put to his head and almost killed.  So this sounds like something you wanted to do.  How enticing.  Well, I did.  I mean, I did.  I mean, I was going, the guy I was going with, you know, knew his way around there. 
[01:37:00]  Who is he?  Even though he looks like Harry Potter.  He's just a friend of mine.  He's the guy from Comedy Central Records.  He's, uh.  And he was your tour guy?  He literally, he is.  He was brought up there.  He lived there.  His father was there trying to, you know, prevent the rain forces from being cut down.  And he lived there.  He went to high school there.  You're talking about the little skinny white guy at Comedy Central, that guy?  Yeah, dude.  That's who you went through the jungles with? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, dude.  With that guy?  Yeah, dude.  He really, I mean, at least I looked, like, nobody, all I had to say was, uh, no gracias.  And nobody would mess with me because I look Guatemalan.  You look like he's sitting in a cave with soldiers' heads around him, doesn't he?  You see the guy, Colonel Kurtz.  The guy you went with you would want to take a tour through Wall Street with, not through the jungles.  This is the most timid little white guy you could ever meet.  Okay, so.  Hey, Jimmy.  Just looking at Rich with disgust on his face.  I love that look.  It's just disgust on his face. 
[01:38:00]  We kind of got that, Rich.  I think I want to pay you guys.  So when he says, let's go to Guatemala, what relics did you think you were going to find?  Like, what were you going to find?  Well.  Where?  Well, you know, it's like, all right.  The first place we went to, first of all, you get there.  Well, can you tell us about the flight?  The flight there?  Yeah.  It's fine.  You get there.  First class?  First class.  All the way to Guatemala.  Yeah, I mean, if you have, uh, if you don't even have Silver Elite, you get to upgrade it.  If you're white, they're like, oh, you're upgraded.  Go ahead.  Because nobody's flying first class to Guatemala.  Yeah, you go to Guatemala.  What kind of animals were on the plane? 
[01:38:30]  Uh.  What were they wearing?  No, I mean, literally, what kind of animals?  Chickens.  Goats.  Yeah.  Besides the hippo in first?  All right, sorry.  Easy.  Easy.  Sorry.  He's losing a lot of weight there.  You better get all the fat jokes in, because I think another two months, the fat jokes  are going to be history with Bobby Kelly.  It was the most really funny week.  I'll have to go back to stupid.  Yeah.  Oh, we got that covered over here.  Yeah, yeah, you got stupid.  I already proved myself from stupid.  You answered one more question than me in the contest. 
[01:39:00]  That's smart.  Yeah, and you just lost going to Guatemala looking for others.  Oh, God.  And I just won, because you spoke.  Wait, wait, wait.  What'd you just say?  I didn't hear you, Rich.  What'd you say?  When he went to look for relics.  Where?  Gualamala.  Oh, Gualamala.  I want to hit you with the Gualamala.  Gualamala.  Gualamala.  Gualamala.  Gualamala.  He said Gualamala.  I don't even think it was on the...  Gualamala.  I meant it.  Jim, that's where all the Oompa Loompas live.  The Gualamala.  Gualamala.  What an idiot. 
[01:39:30]  God, do I hate you.  I'm almost afraid for you.  I want to move back to Gualamala.  Gualamala.  Gualamala.  You're such a moron.  It's like a...  But I don't even know if it's him stupid or...  Dr. Seussland.  I don't know if he's just stupid or it's his teeth.  It's just mushy mouth that affects him.  Can you imagine how much food you could eat with these teeth?  Gualamala.  Oh, my gosh.  Gualamala.  All right, listen.  I hate him.  So the flight was fine.  No animals on the plane.  All right, you get off.  No, because we learned a lot about Gualamala. 
[01:40:00]  Like, they hijack your rent-a-car right from the airport.  Yes, they do.  As soon as you leave the airport grounds, they got fake roadblocks.  None of that stuff happened?  Well, no.  None of that happened.  You know, I'm panicking.  As soon as they get off, because there's a million Gualamalas waiting.  You know, you remember in Brazil, it was ten times worse than that.  You walk out, and they're Indians.  You know, the Spanish came over, conquered them, and they actually, you know, became a  little taller and a little better looking. 
[01:40:30]  You know, the Spain people, the Spanish people are very good looking people, but the Guatemalans  are little, like, five foot Indians.  Right.  They still live there.  Like, some of them are pure Indians.  And all those people are waiting outside.  They're all, like, little fives.  For cabs?  Huh?  No.  They're just outside waiting.  And little kids, like, the same thing with the kids.  With the peanuts?  Well, you've got to be real careful, because they're walking up to you just saying, you  know, talking Spanish, and you're literally just going to walk straight through them.  Is there a lot of civil unrest in this country? 
[01:41:00]  I mean, is it like a country under, you know?  Not anymore.  I mean, it was really bad, but in 1996, they had some, the Peace Accord or something with  the guerrillas and the government.  You know what they did?  As soon as they eliminated 75% of the government, the army, and the country became better, because  the army was actually terrible.  So this guy obviously knows his way around.  Oh, he's Indiana Jones.  I mean, he speaks Spanish.  We had people waiting for us.  Get into the car.  Go to the rent-the-car place. 
[01:41:30]  You get to rent the car.  We rented, like, a crappy Mitsubishi, which is, like, a good car out there.  And we jumped in and went right into the streets, which is, like, driving through the slums  of Brazil.  Like, there's just, these Partridge family buses is their public transportation.  All our old buses go down there.  We just ship over there, sure.  We just ship over there.  We do the same thing with our planes.  Yeah.  That's why planes crash everywhere else in the world.  Yeah, all the planes are on the runway, too.  All the drug-running planes that broke down, they just leave them on the runway. 
[01:42:00]  So as you're flying, there's just these old planes with no propellers and bullet holes  in them, it's just awful.  So you were, like, tall round to his Indiana show?  Yeah.  Oh, I was half.  I was the king of Guatemala.  So did you know this was going to be, like, a third-world kind of a dump when you went  there?  Yeah, I did a lot of research on the internet.  I knew it was going to be bad, and all the homes are, like, in Brazil, too, a lot of  these homes are, all of them have, you know, they're unfinished.  It looks like they're still building them.  Yeah.  Like, there's houses on top of houses. 
[01:42:30]  But the reason why they do that is because if your home is unfinished, you don't have  to pay taxes on it.  So all of them just build them half done.  That sounds great.  Great idea.  And they never finish them, just so that they don't have to pay taxes forever.  Leave their roofs off.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why the place is a dump.  Exactly.  It looks like a dump.  Yeah, what is a dump?  What am I kidding?  But he took me right to a site, an archaeological site.  Say that, Rich.  Rich?  Rich.  Archaeological site.  Wow.  So were they stopping your car? 
[01:43:00]  Did you have to go dig and stuff?  Were you planning on digging?  No, you can't dig, dude.  You can't dig.  Well, how are you going to find a relic if you can just, what do you think?  There's just a, what?  Oh, relic.  How would you find it?  Well, let's go home now.  Use your teeth.  It's a 13th joke.  Keep going.  What about the relic?  Well, they took me to a site, and basically it looks like a park with a bunch of hills in  it.  But underneath the hills, like five feet under the dirt is like the apocalypto pyramids, like  that stuff.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like over time, it's 1,500 years ago, so all the dirt built up on it, and they literally 
[01:43:30]  just said screw it and built over it, most of it.  They just said put a house right over it.  And then, you know, they save like a chunk of it, and you can go in there for free and  walk around.  But as you're walking, they have some of it excavated, so you can actually go into one  of these temples and see all this stuff, but a lot of it isn't.  So you walk around, and nobody's there.  There's like, you know, Guatemalan couples trying to, you know, fool around just by a tree. 
[01:44:00]  There's condoms everywhere.  Paul Mercurio walking.  The big adventurer thing, Indiana Jones thing you were talking about.  This, yeah, well, you're walking around, and literally you kick the dirt.  They're a tree, and like, this is, I found like this.  This is actually a Mayan knife.  This is a real knife.  This is a knife.  No, it's not.  I swear to God, it's a knife head.  I'd like to see you try to eat with that knife.  You'd be finished.  This is.  Okay.  It's made out of, yeah.  Let me see.  Why would I want to touch it?  You went all the way to Guatemala for that piece of crap? 
[01:44:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  The stuff you go to, the full, like a full knife or a full bowl or the stuff that you get,  you have to go drive like three hours.  This is not a Mayan knife.  No, it absolutely is, Jim.  That's 1,500 years old.  Oh, is it?  I swear to God.  You could pick up a rock and say this is a million years old.  No, no, no, no.  They leave this stuff around for tourists.  It's a bad Easter egg.  Okay, stupid.  This is from the.  He's showing us junk.  This is from a bowl.  You went to Guatemala.  Give us something good. 
[01:45:00]  You think I'm bringing in a 1,500-year-old bowl for you to hold?  I know what you do with poker chips.  Did they try to hire you to roll down on people that try to steal relics?  This is a.  That was funny.  That's really good.  Easy to a farmer astronaut.  These are the trinkets of an idiot.  Is that the name of your next album?  So you brought junk in for us.  No, the stuff that I got, I don't have yet.  Because when you can't, I can't even bring this home. 
[01:45:30]  I had a pocket full of this crap, which I found on the site.  You can kick around and find.  You think in 1,500 years, everything that's just on the surface hasn't been picked up already?  You're the first one to go on this tour?  Nope.  How then?  You can see if when you're going, like we were crawling down the back of these hills that you're really not supposed to be at.  And you can see like, you know, the sediment, like, you know, it's like dug away a little bit.  You can see like, like stuff sticking out of it, but you can't, you can't dig through it. 
[01:46:00]  It would take you like two hours to dig through it.  And you'd need a toothbrush because you'd break it.  You know what I mean?  So no one wanted to invest two hours to get something that's 1,500 years old.  So you'd rather pick up the junk that everyone else threw away.  No, this, I'm telling you.  Is that really for real?  Yeah, the stuff, the full stuff that I got, the actual stuff that I have, like I have a poison jar.  You have to go, we drove three hours into the like jungle to these like Indian like towns. 
[01:46:30]  There's nobody there.  You're driving up roads, like, you know, certain parts, like the gorillas can come out and, you know, just they stop, they stop traffic.  Just put a roadblock up and then they just, you know, do whatever with you.  I'd make a joke about today, but I'll leave it alone.  I'm not stupid.  So, well, why would you go there when the gorillas could just stop you?  That's the only way to get to the place we were going.  Do they stop you? 
[01:47:00]  No, no, nope, nothing.  Can you just be thrown in prison?  Yeah, the cops are worse than the Brazil cops.  Yeah, the cops are the same thing.  Of course they are.  Yeah, they're terrible people.  They're all right.  Yeah, they all have those little black jumpsuits.  Really?  Yeah, they look like.  Paramilitary looking.  Yeah, exactly, dude.  And they're all.  I could be one of those.  They're in like Toyota Jeeps.  Yeah, machine guns in the back.  Yeah, dude.  Machine guns, which is, you know, uncomfortable.  But, yeah, plus, you know, when you turn 16, your parents give you a car and a gun as a Guatemalan.  That's nice. 
[01:47:30]  Or someone in Detroit.  Me.  So, all of this.  Oh, you do.  All of this.  I tried.  That was a good line.  All this and this whole risk for a rock that you can't prove is 1,500 years old.  How do you prove it's 1,500?  It's not even a rock.  It's just kind of like.  No, no, no.  The stuff that I got like this is a bottom of a pot from like the.  How can you tell?  How do you know that?  Because the guy I was with, honest to God, I swear to God.  I didn't run into the regular stuff because I didn't want to bring it back through customs. 
[01:48:00]  He knows how to take stuff back.  How do you take it back?  Got to catch an old freighter.  You don't ship it.  You got to.  Like, there's a bunch of other stuff that you buy a bunch of.  I don't want to give away his secrets, but there's a certain way he does it that you put it back in.  And then, you know, if they take stuff out, you're like, oh, this is bullshit.  Okay, go ahead.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but.  But you just throw more curses on regular FM radio.  I'm sorry, guys.  Potty mouth.  I'm still a little out of it. 
[01:48:30]  So you get caught digging in the Mayan ruins.  What happens?  You get arrested.  Really?  Oh, yeah, you can.  It's like going into a museum.  It's protected.  But how do you get there?  You can walk in.  You can look at it.  And it's so funny.  You go in and they dug up all the dirt.  It's like five feet of dirt that's settled over this in the last 1,500 years.  And you go in and it looks like apocalypto.  It's all the stairs and the pyramids.  And you're inside of this place.  And there's only like one 85-year-old Guatemalan guy guarding it. 
[01:49:00]  And, you know, you used to be able to give him a little cash and he'd let you go down and walk around and do some stuff.  But you can't do it anymore.  They'll definitely.  You just can't do it.  What do you mean pyramids?  And it's in the middle of like this city.  The jungle.  It's in the middle.  No, this park, the first place was in the middle of the city.  So it's like, you know, you're not in a really safe area.  It's okay.  But, you know, you're not really safe.  So you're in this middle of this park.  And you don't want to, you know, you just got to kind of go in, look around.  You can kick around a little bit. 
[01:49:30]  That's where I found these little knife heads.  Yeah.  His friend actually found when he was walking around there an actual head from a statue, a face one time.  Really?  Yeah, that's hard to do.  We had to drive three hours into the jungle to go to this little Indian town.  And it hasn't changed in like 400 years.  It's all Guatemalans.  It's, you know, they have like an old church and there's just people screaming with incense.  And they're all sitting on the stairs.  And nobody's been there. 
[01:50:00]  So they all, everybody looks the same.  Like America, people have sex with each other and they mix it up.  So we all look different.  Guatemalans, nobody goes there and has sex with Guatemalans.  So they look the same exact way they've looked for the last 500 years.  It's just the same fat face over and over and over again.  That's creepy.  And they just come right up to you and they just, whatever that, you know.  All I know is, you know, me es su nombre. 
[01:50:30]  That's all I know.  What's that?  That's, what is your, no, it's qual es su nombre.  What is your name?  I'm in, uh, how would you care?  Mi es, mi nombre es Roberto.  My name is Roberto.  That's all I know.  We know what that one is.  How far, how, where is it?  Is it?  Not all of us.  Is this in South America?  Is it in South America?  Well, it's actually, it's actually a good question.  It's not South America.  It's Central America, but you're right.  It's near Moscow.  It's, it's underneath us, as you would say.  Is it in the American basement? 
[01:51:00]  Is this near Aruba?  So wait, it's a three, it's a three hour drive into the jungle.  You have to, yeah, you have to drive, you drive out of the city and it's, it's real.  The dangerous part isn't even like the people coming out of the woods.  The dangerous part, it's a one lane highway and it's up into the mountains, but the, the  buses, this is the only way these people get around and they jam them on.  And like, there's a guy in front that hangs on outside.  They stop, they jam these little Guatemalans on this thing and then they just take off. 
[01:51:30]  But these guys do 50, 60 miles an hour.  Yeah.  You're always hearing about those things plummeting off a cliff.  I saw a truck dude, right off the cliff.  Cause they're, they just, they're driving for hours.  They don't, they drive for 24 hour shifts and they fall asleep at the whale and they'll  just fly off the mountain.  You saw it go off the mountain.  I saw a truck go off the mountain into a gully and you didn't go and rifle through that  and see what you can get out of that truck.  Yeah.  I mean, why drive three hours?  I had a big gas tank on the back of it. 
[01:52:00]  I thought it was going to blow up.  Was the guy all right?  I don't know.  I don't care.  Look at this idol I got.  It's a little bulldog.  Yeah.  So what about the food poisoning?  I got a finger.  Bobby.  Food poisoning?  Well, I want to, wait, I want to get to the three hours thing.  You get in, you, you, you pull into this town.  Um, it's, it's literally.  Cobblestone streets.  Is there a hotel?  Uh, well, yeah.  I mean, the place we stayed the first night, we had to go to, uh, Radisson, so it's pretty  good.  After all this, did you sign your second deal with Combi Central for another CD? 
[01:52:30]  I mean, to do all this?  No.  Oh, come on.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We would try.  We know what you were trying to mean, but.  Yeah.  So Bobby, let's, yeah, let's go.  So anyways, you, you, you, the hotel was unbelievable.  It was like old, all, you know, old school hotel when we got there, but we had to drive  another hour to where we're going to get these.  So three hours plus an hour.  Yeah.  Plus an hour.  And, and you, uh, you get into this town, you park your car.  It's kind of weird.  Cause it's almost like going to Yankee stadium.  There's some Guatemalan waving people in to his little spots. 
[01:53:00]  And then you walk into this town and it's, it's just old, man.  It's old.  It's all Guatemalans and these little, little streets like a flea market, but they go forever  in every direction.  You get a little, it's like a maze of these things and you, you walk down, but then you'll  see like, uh, some old stuff up front and then you go in and then you got to talk to  the guy, he, you know, and then the guy will be like, come back in like 20 minutes with  a bag full of stuff, like legitimate stuff. 
[01:53:30]  And you, you know, uh, you, you, it's just, it's like basically you went this far and bought  stuff at a flea market.  That's pretty much what I'm getting out of this.  You're probably right.  But wait a second.  This isn't this big.  You can't, you could do it in Jersey.  The man went and got the trinkets.  He didn't sell you junk.  Well, the, this stuff is probably taken from like tombs.  Yeah.  Because you like, you know what I'm saying?  You can't, it's so hard to get a piece like a, uh, uh, like a statue that is, uh, together 
[01:54:00]  because when they excavate this place, they, they're going in, they're smashing them, breaking  them up, taking them out.  A lot of the tomb stuff that's buried with these people, uh, are intact because it's in  the tomb.  And that's so, you know, you can't, you're not supposed to even touch that.  Well, if you ever say I'm dumb, you just bought something you think is 1500 years old from  a man in a flea market.  Right.  He went in the back and got an old soda bottle that was broken and said, Hey, the fat guy's 
[01:54:30]  going to pay for this.  Are you out of your mind?  You are probably the dumbest human.  You're the dumbest human I've ever met.  They're all fat.  You know what?  Yeah.  You would, you're a sucker because yeah, let's go for relics and you buy it from a man.  Do you think he's going to sell anything of value to you for $2?  You're right, Voss.  I mean, I could have bought a Rolls Royce off of eBay.  I didn't buy it.  I didn't buy it.  No, here's the second question.  No, I could have.  Not to get, not to go against the culture in me, but yeah.  Here's the second question.  When you go in Brazil, like don't rob you and kill you.  They say don't bring any valuables down to Brazil. 
[01:55:00]  Will that happen in this place?  I mean, were you scared to walk around that you'd get stabbed or shanked with a relic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get, yeah.  You get killed.  Yeah.  They kill people.  I mean, kill people all the time.  All the time.  Let's go to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn Ace.  Bobby, what, do you want to get through this story in real time?  I'm sorry, dude.  It's a bit slow.  It's a bit slow.  I'm a little, I'm still getting over being sick, dude.  Are you all right?  I'll speed it up.  We're going to get into you getting sick after the break, all right?  Yes.  What, you got some kind of food poisoning on your last night?  I got amoebas.  I got the amoebas. 
[01:55:30]  Actual amoebas.  Yeah, I got the amoebas.  Oh, wow, wow, wow.  We'll talk about that in a bit.  And also, Club Soda Kenny's latest phone scam after the break, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, Rich Foster Studio, playing the brokerage on Long Island, brokeragecomedy.com.  He'll be there Friday and Saturday night.  Robert Kelly in studio.  He's back from Guatemala.  And people are calling BS on your story, by the way, Bobby.  Of all what?  BS?  Bob is full of BS. 
[01:56:00]  No way Guatemalans sell him real stuff for a few bucks.  They take their religions very seriously and would probably trample him on sight if he set foot anywhere near sacred ground.  Yeah, all right.  Stupid.  And then this person's mad that you're calling Guatemalans fat.  Yeah, well, you know what?  Fat little face is what he said.  I said fat little faces.  Deny that.  Is he Guatemalan?  I'm assuming he knows a little bit about Guatemala.  Yeah, well, whatever.  So get into the food poisoning.  What happened the last day there?  Well.  Were you drinking the water? 
[01:56:30]  No, you're out of your mind.  No, I drink.  No, you win.  They trick you.  Yeah, they put ice.  I told you, they put ice in the water and then they just pour the soda or whatever in the ice.  And you're like, ah, and then you figure this guy had to go, no, no, no, no, like nine times to me.  Really?  He said no ice?  Yeah.  Yeah, because the ice is the water, obviously.  Yeah, they just freeze the amoeba and then it unfreezes in your belly.  Oh.  What about the bottle water?  Is it okay?  The bottle water's fine, yeah.  How do you know the bottle water's fine?  They might be bottling it in Guatemala.  No, no, no, no, they get their cable from us. 
[01:57:00]  They steal cable from us.  Really?  Oh, yeah, once a month.  On cable.  There's no cable.  Like the first night there, there was no cable in the hotel because once a month we change the codes on the cable and they have to re-get the codes, figure it out, and then everybody gets cable.  Yeah, but they're selling you real relics.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm telling you, it was 1,500 years old, dude.  I saw the thing.  Like, why would the guy do that, dude? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  He was honest.  You're right.  I could be a sucker.  I think you are.  I wouldn't say could be.  Dude, it's a Mayan knife, dude.  I'd be happy to go down there with you, Anthony, and we can do it and find out.  I would never.  Oh, you think?  Why would I do that?  I'd love to go with Anthony.  What planet are we broadcasting from today?  He'd go down there with a six-shooter.  I'd join whatever mercenary force was down there.  How much you give me for this Guatemalan spoon?  From the Mayan.  Note to the listeners, Jimmy is now holding up a plastic spoon from the deli. 
[01:58:00]  Barry Riles from Pittsburgh writes, the amoebas just thought that Bob was their father since  they have the same body type.  I actually don't know.  That's Jimmy who has an amoeba body type.  Bobby looks good.  Bobby's lost a lot of weight.  We better get all fat jokes in.  I know, Jimmy.  You look thin, but if you got naked, you'd still have an amoeba shape.  It's not like you have shape.  That's very hurtful, Bobby.  What's wrong with you today?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm a little sick.  Leave Jimmy alone.  Leave Jimmy alone. 
[01:58:30]  So you think you got sick from the ice cubes?  Yeah, there was a bunch of little Jimmys floating around in the ice cubes.  Really?  And how bad was it?  Worst ever?  Dude, it was terrible.  It was terrible.  Because it just hits you.  I woke up at two in the morning, and everything was coming out of everywhere.  I was just screaming.  Scream puking?  It was almost funny.  I almost started laughing. 
[01:59:00]  I wish you would have recorded that.  I wish I had electronics.  I wish I took anything down there.  I had nothing.  You didn't have any camera?  No.  Why?  Because you'd get robbed.  Anybody with a camera, you'd get robbed.  How do you have a camera?  You bought a fake wallet on Friday.  In hindsight, I probably could have took it down.  I was just so paranoid going down there that I would be attacked with anything.  Because if you read the internet, the stuff that they read on Friday, it's crazy.  But it's not that bad.  You bought a fake wallet?  I got a fake wallet.  I had a money belt with all my stuff in it. 
[01:59:30]  I got down there.  I kept saying, when do I put my money belt on?  When do I put my money belt on?  He's like, not now.  Relax.  Not now.  I'm like, you want to put it on now?  I went up, lost $400.  How?  I mugged myself.  What?  I was so nervous.  I'm such a moron.  How'd you lose the money?  What did you do?  Because I'm sitting there, I'm dying to put my money belt on.  Why would you put that on?  Because they won't charge you for that?  No, because they pickpocket you.  At this one place that I went to.  Can I jump in?  Jimmy, on Friday, explain this.  But basically, they tell you you should get a fake wallet, put like five, six bucks in 
[02:00:00]  it, put it in your back pocket, because they're going to try to take your wallet, and  they get the five or six bucks.  They'll leave you alone.  And your real money's on a money belt in front of you.  Yeah, but after you get pickpocketed by one pickpocket.  That's how bad it is, though.  They recommend you get a fake wallet, so let them have the fake wallet, and you keep  everything up.  And get to my money belt.  It's pretty hard, because you have to pick up my stomach, and it's underneath that.  It's like a Bible belt.  So you lost $400, you said?  Yeah.  Well, how?  Because I had all my money.  You put it in your shoe and squished it. 
[02:00:30]  The money's impossible to squish.  I know.  Why don't you give yourself a car crash on that one?  Is that right?  I'm not sure.  Yes, but they were all Susan B. Anthony Dollars.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Winsack!  Your turn, Voss.  I'm on your side.  I'm on your side.  So $400, how'd you lose it?  Go.  It fell out.  It fell out?  Yeah, I don't know what happened to it.  I have no idea.  I got back to the hotel.  Really?  Yeah, exactly.  I got back to the hotel.  It fell out.  They're really good at pickpockets. 
[02:01:00]  I just got back to the hotel that night, and I separated my money.  Like, I put this money here, this money there, and then I put this here.  And I had three money belts.  I was so paranoid.  Just so they can get around you?  I had a prostitute once, and I had $700, but this was 30 years.  It was a lot of money, and I put it in my sock, except for $10 in my pocket.  And when she shimmied my pants, and I didn't even realize it, she picked the $10 out of my pocket. 
[02:01:30]  That's how good she was.  She would have got the whole thing, you know?  They were pros, man.  Sure shimmied.  Yeah.  From a shimmie.  Whatever that means.  Yeah.  It was bad.  I lost that, and I forgot my PSP on the plane.  It was so sick.  I forgot it?  Yeah, I left it.  Dude, I was out of my mind.  You don't understand what was coming out of me.  Why couldn't you call Continental?  Someone probably turned it in.  I didn't even care.  What's your PSP?  You just went at home.  Dude, I was so sick.  It was horrible.  Jesus.  It was un...  Stuff came... 
[02:02:00]  You know when bile comes out?  When you...  Yeah, yeah.  It's yellow, and...  There's nothing else to puke up, but your body's still trying to get rid of...  It's like jelly.  Yeah, it's like this stuff that's coming...  Oh, so you puke yourself up.  It was awful.  How did it sound?  They already did that joke, stupid.  No, you didn't.  No, you're such a...  Listen to the show that you're on as it's happening.  Are his headphones on?  Yeah, it was...  And it was coming out like sand.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, it was just hitting the bottom of the bowl.  But why would... 
[02:02:30]  I mean, you said of water.  Couldn't the food have gotten you sick, too?  Yeah, it could have been the food.  It could have been, you know, the lettuce that the guacamole was...  Guacamole...  Ugh, he's speaking like him now.  Guacamole was on.  It's anything.  And I thought...  You know, I'm such a...  You know, I'm a fat ass.  I'm down there going, hey, I want to taste Guatemala.  Take me...  But it's not like...  It's not like, you know, Italy, where they have a million different flavors.  They eat a piece of meat, a sausage, refried beans, and that's it.  That's all you get...  Because they're poor. 
[02:03:00]  Pretty much everywhere, yeah.  Were you, you know...  Yeah, they're...  No, so you were getting rid of stuff from both ends?  Both ends.  Did it get to the point where you were dry heaving from the other end?  Have you ever had that happen before?  Ugh.  Your muscles are just trying to get things done, and there's nothing to get rid of, but  your body is still going through that, on that, and that's when you know you have it  really bad.  It's puckering like a worm's mouth.  Yeah.  It sounded...  They call it dry heaving from your you-know-what. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  It was like someone was pouring water out of a bottle.  It was just coming out like water.  Whoa.  And you almost had to stay there because you were that sick?  Yeah, dude.  I almost could...  I had to fly.  We had to take two flights.  We had to go to the airport.  We had to go to the car, run to the place, go to the airport, go through customs, go  through customs in Houston, get on the plane, you know, two flights.  It was going to take...  We didn't get in until one o'clock at night last night.  We left at, I think, ten o'clock in the morning.  Ugh.  I was up all night from two o'clock until all night just puking, and it's hard because 
[02:04:00]  you're making a decision.  Like, the trash cans were metal trash.  There was no paper bag in them.  It was just a metal lit can.  Yeah.  So it's not like I could use that, too.  So I had to make a choice.  Like, I had to, like, see which front or back, and then, you know, switch it up in  the middle.  It was awful.  Awful.  Awful.  At the same time, like, when you throw up, a lot of times when you throw up, you'll lose  control on your back.  So you were doing it at the same time?  I was trying not to, yes. 
[02:04:30]  Some guy called.  Remember that guy that called about that?  Yeah.  So that he was vomiting, and he also had an upset tummy.  Yeah.  And he...  The wall behind him, because he was obviously puking into the toilet.  Well, you gotta lean over to puke, so you can just imagine what's going on behind you.  He started puking, and the wall behind him just...  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you're making gang signs on the wall behind you.  Yeah, it's graffiti.  I'm an artist.  It looks like a scene from Lockup.  Oh. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, that almost happened a few times.  Like a spray paint can when it's running out of air.  The other guy didn't get sick?  You were with...  No, he lived there for five years, and he goes down all the time, so his stomach is...  Because our water, we're so purified.  Everything we eat is so clean.  Those people don't wash their hands.  Yeah, but they don't get sick from it, either.  No, they don't get sick.  They used to...  They're immune to everything.  Yeah.  Imagine trying to send something back.  What, down there?  Yeah.  I mean, the food was all right.  We went to...  Yeah, imagine, because people in America are scared off. 
[02:05:30]  I'll just eat the raw hamburger.  I don't know what they're going to do with the kitchen.  Yeah, imagine in Guatemala.  A lot of the stuff was good.  Antigua was great.  Antigua was really good.  I'm going to fry up a slug and squash it into this burger.  Upper West Side Jew complaining, this isn't church.  Yeah.  Oh, I would love to see that.  Where's Antigua?  Antigua is...  Guatemala?  Oh, yeah.  I know where that is.  I think it's like an hour and a half out of Guatemala City.  That's a resort area, though.  That's actually nice.  It's actually a nice area.  If people go there, it's like... 
[02:06:00]  But there's the dead dog road we had to go through.  Literally, it's just dead dogs everywhere.  Because they're wild dogs that just run around.  And the highway, I swear to God, they just drive 60 miles an hour at all times.  Raining, whatever.  These bus drivers are trying to get wherever they're getting to.  And people die all the time.  And they just hit the dogs.  That's it.  And there's just dead dogs everywhere.  It's almost funny because the guy's like, this is dead dog highway.  And then as soon as he said that, there's a dead dog, a dead dog, dead dog.  I saw a dog get hit by a car in the street. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you hear that?  And then he's just...  Nobody moves.  Do you appreciate America, Bobby?  Do I appreciate...  Yeah, I appreciate that we have clean water.  Oh, my God.  You can just take a shower with your mouth open.  Very nice.  But I'm glad to be back.  And then we actually got held up by guns.  What?  At...  I'm kidding.  I just wanted to make the story interesting at the end.  That didn't make a lot of sense that you wouldn't have said that before.  Yeah.  I mean, glad to be back.  You went for two days.  It's not that you were there for a month. 
[02:07:00]  It felt like a...  It felt like a month.  So did the story.  It felt like a...  No, no.  That was...  Oh, I'm sorry.  What'd you do?  Carboy?  Teasing.  Okay.  That's exciting.  I'm done in Guatemala.  It was good to play.  You drove.  And I'm like, well, how far?  Three hours.  But then you hit this...  Let's go to Gladys in New Hampshire.  Gladys.  Yes.  How you doing?  Hey, sexy name.  Hey, Gladys.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Hi.  Yeah.  I just want to know, where did he got to Guatemala? 
[02:07:30]  What part of Guatemala did he...  Where you grew up?  Well, she obviously knows the thing, too.  Do you know Felipe?  I don't know the other two towns we went to.  I went to Antigua the first day.  We're in Guatemala City for a day.  And then we went to...  I forget the name of it.  I really do.  It's like two hours out of Antigua.  It was a little town.  I forget the name of it, honey.  I'm sorry.  I don't know. 
[02:08:00]  Tijuana.  Cares.  Did you cheat you or something like that?  Do you know what I'm...  Does that make anything to you?  No.  It's like an hour and a half, two hours out of Antigua.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Gladys.  Who cares, Gladys?  I feel sorry about the dead dogs, because we're doing a dog fundraiser.  I know.  Tomorrow night at...  I know.  The guy here in New York City.  Who is that singing?  The dog fundraiser.  That's Clay Aiken.  Doesn't he look sickly?  He looks like a chick.  I thought it was Katie Lang.  Well, he might be a little light in the loafers, rumor has it. 
[02:08:30]  Who doubts the fact that he loves one in the face?  Who doubts the fact that whenever he sees one, he makes this noise.  You guys aren't watching that this year, American Idol?  We kind of blew it off this year.  There was a moment last night, though, that I think we have somewhere around here.  Yeah.  One of the kids screwed up.  One of the kids screwed up his Dylan song last night.  A lot of people are talking about it.  Oh, that kid's going home.  I think we got a quick clip. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.  I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.  And hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.  And he said, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  Oh, oops.  Oopsie.  Then he lost confidence.  Simon told him to pack his bag. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that's Simon.  Don't get on his bad side.  Oh, boy.  Well, very unpredictable what the judges had to say.  I mean, Paula said something very different this time around.  And, yeah, Simon said something extremely different, very, very out of character for  these two.  Don't you know the lyrics?  Tell me, man.  What do you think?  How did you think that was?  Well, I lost some lines in there.  That's kind of bad.  Lost some words in there.  Jason's not in the zone tonight.  I don't know what's going on, man.  You know what? 
[02:10:00]  It is what it is.  It's at this point of the competition, though, that you guys have solidified your niche.  And, you know, obviously it didn't blow us away, but you blow me away.  Oh, really?  You blow me away.  Jason?  I'd pack your suitcase.  Oh, no.  Simon, you didn't.  To go on vacation after I win?  Go to Guatemala.  Simon.  I hate that kid. 
[02:10:30]  Every song sounds like boop, skip, dip, boop, boop, da, boop, bing, bing.  Everything's a beep.  What?  I'm not even watching it.  I don't even care about it.  I watch it every week.  Are you addicted to it?  I'm married, yeah.  You've been watching it for years?  I've been watching it, yeah.  I watch it every week.  I have no problem saying that.  I was really into it last year, and for some reason I decided, I don't want to watch this again.  I don't even like, the only one I like is that David Cook, David Archuleta, I hate him.  He's like a robot, him and his dad, and he licks his lip. 
[02:11:00]  He's only 17 years old.  It doesn't matter.  He stinks.  Socially, he's a loser.  Leave the little kid alone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh my God.  Thank you.  I got a new best show on TV, is The Family Guy.  It's the funniest thing.  Have you seen this?  It's the funniest thing.  Can I leave?  Can I leave?  I'm telling you.  No, I know my, listen.  First of all, I know my Guatemalan story was boring as hell.  I apologize.  I'll speed it up next time, and I'll add some gunfire, and I'll get raped.  Have you seen Ronan Martin's Laugh-In? 
[02:11:30]  It's a real hoot.  They come out of doors and joke at each other.  I just saw the show.  It's really kooky.  Dick Van Dyke?  Hold on.  We don't know what Family Guy is about.  What's that?  You know what it's about.  I actually never see it.  Let me tell you something.  What is it about?  Why is it so funny?  Because it's the hippest, most inside cartoon, the stuff they do on it is just-  Like what?  Give us an example.  Well, they had Liza Minnelli.  I don't know how they cut to Liza Minnelli laying on the ground as a showgirl. 
[02:12:00]  She made Bobby look anorexic.  She was about 1,000 pounds.  She looked like a little seal, just a big, fat Liza Minnelli laying there going,  Do you love me now, Mommy?  Right?  It was just so funny.  Do you guys want me to tell my Guatemala story again?  Do you need to slow it up?  So anyways, I'm on the highway, and there's these dogs.  Oh, my God.  He just found Family Guy.  Yeah.  You know what Family Guy's been around for?  Five years, probably?  Six years?  No, because Seth MacFarlane almost died in 9-11, so it's got to be seven or eight years now. 
[02:12:30]  Okay, so here's the thing.  Nine years?  Okay.  Well, guess what?  1999.  Okay.  I don't watch a lot of TV.  You saw this new movie.  You see this thing called The Birth of the Nation?  Don't.  Can I be on when he's on all the time?  Rich, you do realize our listeners probably watched that show and have been for many,  many years.  Well, I'm not plugging.  You were excited like, oh, my God, I got to turn everybody on to something new and different. 
[02:13:00]  Funny.  I'm going to kill it at the brokerage.  You'll never see a bad show.  Rich Boss on stage.  It's always different.  Always new material.  Come to the brokerage.  Guarantee you'll have a good time.  This Friday and Saturday.  BrokerageComedy.com.  Bobby, you got anything?  No, I had Seattle, but Patrice played there, so my gig got canceled.  What?  What happened?  Patrice did a show there, and all of a sudden my gig's canceled.  He called me from there.  No, what?  Yeah.  What's that about?  I don't know. 
[02:13:30]  He called me.  He sent me a text message about how awful it was, and then I was supposed to be there  next week.  You promoted it last week, and now I got a call.  It's canceled.  Why?  Did they give you a reason?  Yeah.  They said it was a big, fat gorilla actually came in and wrecked the room.  Well, these clubs are just crazy.  I don't know.  Yeah.  There's a club in Baltimore real quick.  They make the feature acts, the middle acts, buy tickets, sell them, and the profit they 
[02:14:00]  make from selling them is what they get paid for the weekend.  Oh, my God.  These clubs.  Who does that?  Baltimore, one of the clubs there, the outlet or something.  They're just ruthless.  And Patrice called me.  Just buy my CD, just a tip.  iTunes, Amazon, Seattle's canceled.  We're going to XM, so we'll see you here tomorrow unless you're coming over to XM.

I assume Derek  Derek rocked that one  Very good Derek  I think Butcher came up  With something for today  Oh Butcher's is good  First let's say hi  To Scott in Massachusetts  Scott  Hey Bobby  Was it Chichie Custinango  That you were in  In Guatemala?  Yeah I think that is  One of the places  What is that?  Is that where the  Flea market was?  I think so yeah  I'm not too sure  But that is  I think that's one of the places  Yeah I think that's it  Yeah why  It's  It was just the most  Fucked up place in the world 
[02:20:00]  And people loading up  These little Toyota  You know  Pick up trucks  With potatoes  Or whatever else  They're growing  Yeah  Bringing them into these markets  It was  It was  Unbelievable  Why you went there?  I did  We adopted a little girl  From Guatemala  But  Did you really?  Funny story  Going up into the mountains  Yeah  We're traveling to that  Chichie Custinango  And Anthony will appreciate this  We get halfway up  And all of a sudden  There's these armed guards  In  Tactical 511  Where with AK-47 rifles 
[02:20:30]  Stop the taxi that we're in  Right  I'm shitting myself  Going  We're gonna die  Guy comes over to the car  I've got all the paperwork  And everything for my daughter  And the cab driver's like  Here just relax  Everything will be alright  My wife's looking at me like  What the hell's going on?  They come over  They go through all the paperwork  Check our passports  Check everything  And let us go  They just must have  You know  Checkpoints  You know  Along the way  But it was the scariest thing  I've ever experienced  In my life 
[02:21:00]  Were they rude to you?  No  They were pretty good  I mean  You know  It's funny  You walk around Guatemala City  Every single store  Has armed guards  You know  It was  McDonald's  You go to McDonald's  There's an armed guard  That lets you in  You found a McDonald's  In Guatemala  We went into McDonald's  There's a Hooters  In Guatemala  They have a Hooters too  Yeah  They have a Hooters  Oh Hooters  But I mean  You go to the gas station  They must be attractive  Guy with a shotgun  Really  Every single place  Because they just rob it  That's good  They just go in and rob it  So yeah  Every place 
[02:21:30]  But you're lucky  Because when  They were doing  There was a lot of  When people adopting babies  That's why they were  Killing people  They thought they were  Adopting babies  To harvest them for organs  Oh yeah  Yankees go home  You know  I heard it all  I mean  You know  As far as you get  These stairs  Like you know  They just want to  Slit your throat  They gotta be a group  Of really dumb people  Because I mean  Americans can bring in  Some fine  You know  Dollars  Tourism dollars  In Africa  When we sent over  Condoms  When we sent over  Condoms to help

[02:22:30]  You're adopting a baby  They charge you money  Like they would charge  Like a thousand dollars  Really  Yeah  Yeah  There's a lot of that  Where the cops  Because the cops  Are all dirty  Would say  Alright  You get a thousand dollars  And you can take the kid  Wow  You're lucky  We were pretty lucky  It was a pretty good experience  But  Did you pay for the  Definitely  A fucked up country  To say  How much  How much does a kid  Cost from Guatemala  It was about  Thirty five thousand dollars  Get down  Wait  Do you have to go through  A big process here  In this country 
[02:23:00]  Or is it  Through  Yeah  We went to an  Adoption agency  In the states  And then  You know  Who deals with  You know  Guatemala  All the time  And I mean  The decent part  About Guatemala  Is they have  You know  Which sucks  And that's why  It's so expensive  But  They've got lawyers involved  So they take care of  The pregnant women  And the mothers  And everything else  When the kid grows up  Are you going to make  The kid pay you back  I mean  Thirty five thousand  Is a lot of money  No  I know  So tell us the story  You're shooting blanks  Or the wife  Have a  Vink  Make it 
[02:23:30]  Attic  Nothing like that  Just  Nothing like that at all  But just  Give her  Someone an opportunity  That's all  But here's another  Cobwebs  When you  When you adopt  In this country  Does it cost  That kind of money  I mean  If you want  To adopt  It's probably more  For a white baby  It's about the same price  That's the problem  Reason why  A lot of people  Go to other countries  Because the waiting list  Here in America  Is a nightmare  Is that the true  That's true right sir  Yes  It's not as easy  It's not as easy  As people think 
[02:24:00]  To adopt  In America  No of course  But  No I mean  It was probably  A year long  Year long process  That we went through  How long  You got foster homes  That are full  Orphanages  And adoption agencies  That are full of kids  Orphanages  And they're selling them  You're resistant  I know  Why don't you call  Nutty Fagan  Yeah  More  More please  Go to boys times  Of course you bring it  Right to food  Stupid Oliver Twist  Shut your face  Shut up stupid  I'm just saying  With all the people  With all the foster homes  And everything  Full of kids  Why is it so hard to adopt

[02:37:30]  Yeah  In his car  Kenny wants a mic badly  Yes Kenny  He doesn't pay the openers  He doesn't pay the features  He doesn't pay  And Patrice is right  He makes the comic  Pick you up at the airport  What comic  I rented a car  The opener  The opener  Has to like  Do double duty  Oh my god  And he doesn't pay them  You know  They do it for stage time  The guy's a one man operation  He collects the money  At the door  Then he runs behind the bar  Then he goes serve drinks  I understand 
[02:38:00]  That's kind of cheapness  I understand that  There's clubs like this  Out there  But it amazes me  That this is like  What Patrice said  The top club in Seattle  Make my bed you  I did a shithole  Two weeks ago  I did a shithole  Outside of  In Grand Rapids  Dr. Grins  It's a fucking shit  They charge me for food  I go  I'm the fucking headliner  They go  You gotta pay for food  They go  I get in the town  They go  You gotta do morning  And afternoon radio  I go  Nobody told me that  I'm not your fucking  The host  Like Patrice says

[02:39:30]  And  You know  I say Patrice  You obviously don't like Patrice  That's the only reason  You're mentioning his name  Well no  It's the club  Without the guy  Why would you put Patrice  In this situation  Well first of all  Patrice  Listen  Patrice could be working  Patrice is a big star  He was in the paper  The other day  Holding a cute puppy  He could be in the Taj Mahal  And Patrice would fuck it up  What I'm saying is  Listen  The club  The comedy room itself  Is a good room  Right Patrice  Yeah Patrice  You said the crowd  Were good though

[02:50:00]  I know friends of mine  Who have girlfriends  And fuck them  And it's like  Wow  But all the time  Like  But they're really into fucking their chick  Yeah  And it's like  There's something about sex  That is fucked up to me  Why aren't you into fucking your chick?  It's not that I'm not into fucking my chick  It's that I'm disconnected  Sex is a bad thing  Sex  I was taught sex  In a fucked up way  So it represents bad to me  So if I'm with somebody  That I give a shit about 
[02:50:30]  I don't want to do bad shit to that person  Exactly  I don't want to do shit  Bad shit to her  I want to do  I don't mind doing bad shit to some chick  I meet in New Brunswick  That  You know  Fuck her  I don't give a shit  Like some  Some chick that just wants to suck my cock  Fantastic  My dick just goes  Wah  I can't even fucking not have a hard on around her  But somebody who give a shit about  It's like  It's like fuck  This is bad  This is fucking bad  How the fuck do you get over that?  I don't know  You gotta  Retrain yourself  You gotta  You have to go back  And find out those things 
[02:51:00]  That happened  Oh boy  That made it  Exactly  That made it bad  But you also stop acting out  Like  Like if you stop acting out  Like my dick has been all over the place lately  Because I'm not  I mean occasionally I am  Jerking off  But not nearly like what I was  I would literally go home after the show  I would try to nap  And I couldn't nap  Because I would jerk off  And I wouldn't stop jerking off  Until it was fucking  Like I would force myself to go to the gym  And then fucking  And then  Work out  And then go do my spot  And then you know  Jerk off again at night  It was awful dude 
[02:51:30]  Don't you  Awful  I jerk  In hotels on the road  I have to jerk off every day  But it doesn't take  You know it's different  If you're jerking off healthy  Like if you just scrap a load  You throw some lube on your dick  And you're fucking pumping out  All over yourself  And take a nap  That's fine  But if you're on Craigslist  For three hours  Right  Humping down she-mails  Not that I do that  No me neither  But I mean you know  So Jimmy Waddle  And you get pre-cum coming out  For the whole three hours  It's called edging  And then as soon as you find one  And you just shoot it  And it comes out  And you feel nothing 
[02:52:00]  Why don't you just jerk it off  Really fast  And maybe you can move on  With other activities  For that day  Believe me  Right now  That was Jim Norton  In the mirror  A thousand times  I would love to know  But what is that about  It's escape  It's numbing feelings  My therapist told me  To numb your feelings  When you jerk off  In the mirror  That's a sign  Of split personality  Shut the fuck up  It is a sign  Of split personality  If you jerk off  In the fucking mirror  That's creepy  Maybe you just like  Looking at yourself  Jerking off  Listen to me  I'm not a fucking doctor  But I know 
[02:52:30]  Really  You're not  Dr. Gloss  Really  Wow  It is something  You're not even a fucking  High school student  You're barely you  It is something about  You don't feel  And it sounds gay  But you have to  Learn how to feel  Something  It's actually  Because you don't want to  Because you grow up  With so much fucking pain  Yeah  With whatever's happening  That you learn  How to do things  That make you not feel pain  I've jacked though 
[02:53:00]  To fucking websites  And shit like that  And you know  Spent a long time  Doing it  You know  You wait  You get right to the brink  And stop  Because it fucking feels good  There's no deep dark  Fucking secret there  For some people it is  That's what these guys  Are getting at  That's what I'm saying  Like a guy like you  Is a fucking amazing to me  Because you're connected  In a fucking different way  You can jack off  And then go fucking  Pay your bills  And fucking do shit  Yeah but also  And then you can go  Drink and buy guns 
[02:53:30]  So you have the same thing  But you have  You fan it out  Okay  I don't drink anymore  I don't do drugs anymore  I did quit smoking  My eating is not bad  So it all fucking  Comes out through my hand  My nipples and my dick  All of it  All of that self-hatred  All that big thing  Just dumps out that way  Dumps out your cock  Yeah all that need to escape  Comes out your dick hole  If I could fucking  If I was eating cake  Until fucking 3 in the morning  Or drinking again  It wouldn't be as bad  Then you'd be Bobby Kelly  Well you know what  No honest to god though 
[02:54:00]  I mean  Food is just like sex  Because you're on the fucking road  And you don't want to  You don't want to get a whore  You don't want to fucking  Go to a massage parlor  You don't want to let some chick  With fucking warts  Come into your fucking room  And dry fucking boner  So you're like  Fuck it  You get a pizza  And it actually  Same thing  You disconnect  It's gratification  It's that quick fix  It's the same with comedy  It's not feeling  You don't want to feel  It's not that you don't want to feel  You want to feel  You want to feel quickly  And you want to rush  No it's that you don't want to feel anything 
[02:54:30]  What do you think  Boss finger pretzels  Don't bite your finger  Just get it  They're real small  He just has mustard  On his fingernail  Yeah  I uh  Jimmy what are you doing  We're having a serious discussion  About your problems  He's going to make a hand  He's going to make  Boss's hand  Out of the pretzels  Here's the thing  Fucking visual jokes  On the radio  Here's the thing  We got five little pretzels 
[02:55:00]  What I'm saying is about my  He just did a ginger  You're going to look at  Boss's hand  Yes of course  Very funny Jimmy  So Jimmy you'd like  Where's this going to go  I don't know  I hope that I  Can stay away from it  Let me swallow my pretzel  Because  It's fucking making my life  Miserable  Is it?  Awful  It looks like it's making it  Miserable though  Not doing it  No  Can't you change your  Your practices  Well yeah  Like Ope said  You know  Just jack off 
[02:55:30]  And shoot  And then go about your business  But yeah  But I wasn't even jerking off  When I was horny  I was just jerking off  Because  Yeah but  It was something  That's the thing  If you're horny  And you're like  Fuck me  I want to scrap a load  That's healthy  Yeah you scrap a load  No one cares  I'm not saying  I wouldn't do that  But I don't know  How to do that  Like what I do  Is I wind up on Craigslist  Just looking at ads  Or I wind up on  One of eight websites  And it's fucking hours  And it's fucking endless  Well like Ope said  Just fuck ass  It sounds like  There's like an OCD thing  Happening there too 
[02:56:00]  I know what you mean  But no  I mean maybe  Just because it's like  There's a tick  It is about a  Boss is right  And Bobby's right  So it is about  Feeling nothing  And numbing yourself  And it is a quick fix  In the sense  That you're getting a rush  It's that endorphin release  It's like a drug  And let's be honest  When a guy comes  There's a major disappointment  Right after you come  It's like you go from  A really cool high  To poof  Let me tell you something  You're just crashing hard  Then you gotta help them  With our homework  It's just horrible  Jerking off  Is like a big hug  It's like a hug 
[02:56:30]  From the dad you never had  It's just God  A fucking lonely hug  Of spoon  Well it was the same  As when you used to  Women jump up  And start doing chores  And they're like  Just happy after  And stuff  And guys there  There's a massive crash  That happens  But we're brought up  On sex  In a fucked up  We're brought up  With porn  And magazines  And fuck fuck  Fuck this bitch  I fucked that bitch  Women have brought up  The whole  The opposite spectrum  It's like  Find somebody you love  And fucking romance  And blah blah blah  And you don't want to fuck  We're brought up 
[02:57:00]  Fuck that bitch  You fucked that bitch  I fucked that  I mean  So we're brought up  In a fucked up way  It's just  And it sucks for us  My wife was  Well that's because  There had to be  A balance made  Or else nothing  Would get done  In this world  We'd all just be  Fucking  Or  If it was the other way  Around  Human  Human  Beings wouldn't exist  Yeah but then  There's a point  There's a point in life  That when you meet  A chick you like  And all of a sudden  You're supposed to be  You're supposed to be  Like them

[03:42:00]  So I'm making out with her  And I got my hand under her dress  She has like one of these  Slip dresses that you know  You tie  And I'm fingering her  Right on Broadway  Great description of a dress  I'm fingering her  On Broadway  And she's having  And as I'm fingering her  Norton's standing behind her  Just squeezing her butt  Like it was nice  With that Norton face  When he gets dirty  So I fingered her  And she came  She came right on Broadway  So then we get in the car  And we drive her out  And we go up to Central Park  Right?  Norton looks  He has false teeth 
[03:42:30]  When he's getting  Really turned on  He just sucks his top lip in  His top lip goes in  He crinkles his nose  Yeah his nose  Comes over his upper lip  And then his eyes squint  And he gets that little  Angry brow  I'm gonna fucking kill somebody  Wait did I  Did I squat behind her too?  I think I squatted behind her  On the fucking  On Broadway  Yeah on Broadway  You're squatting on your knees  Grabbing her  This is 1968  What?  Who the fuck does that now?  How could you even  Get away with that?  It was between  A newspaper stand and a car  Yeah  It was dark really  Oh well  And he's 
[03:43:00]  Go ahead  You can tell the rest  Oh god  So then we drive around  And we go up to Central Park  And we park on the east side  And there's a little wall there  And we climb over the wall  And we go down  Into like the fucking woods  Of Central Park  And she is fucking hot  And then she starts  Blowing me  Right?  She's on  She's on  She's blowing me  She's standing  This is fucking  Cruising with Al Pacino  She's blowing me  And then I look down  Wait she was standing  And blowing you? 
[03:43:30]  She bent over  No bent over  Bent over  You know like that  She forgot to tell us  She was a midget  And then uh  When she was young  I was the only midget  In the story  She was young  And then she bent over  Blowing me  And I look down  And Norton  Is eating her ass  Like it's candy  I see his face  Eating her  Like I  You know I wasn't really into it  And then I look  And I go  He's just eating  This strange girl's ass  Right?

Yeah but my dick was kind of  Half in and out  So I had to jerk off  She like licked my balls  Or something  She hated it  She didn't want any part of me  She was just doing it for him  And I ate her ass  So she probably felt  Somewhat obligated  It's like when you let a salesman  In the house  She was like  I gotta get something  Alright  You gotta buy something  What's the cheapest thing  You got for something  Yeah shit  Fuck man  So we  Then we're driving home  Right?  He just ate her ass  And I go  I said to him  I go  Did you have a good time? 
[03:45:00]  He goes  Yeah it was kind of fun  But I was a little uncomfortable  Because I don't want to get  My pants dirty  Kneeling down  I go  But you'll eat a strange girl's ass  And you're worried about  Grass stains  Grass stains on the knees  Of your pants  And you just rush over things  Like he tells the story badly  He gives it away  Not that it's a big secret  But it was like  The way it happened  From what I remember  I'm like yeah  My legs are really sore  You're like wow  I'm like I was squatting down  I didn't want to kneel on the grass  And get my pants dirty  You just rush right to it  He was so easy  He's eating her ass  You reiterated that  Like we got it

On a race, under its head.  And he's switching it up.  That's good.  One more runner-up line of the day.  Oh, we're up to line of the day.  Okay.  FTD.com.  The new sponsor of line of the day.  Thank you.  Happy Mother's Day, Mom.  Someone said it's hilarious that I'm trying to do the FTD read and you're puking in the  background.  It's for flowers for Mom.  Well, and then you can go even further with that.  It's because of Jimmy's asshole muscles. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  Line of the day.  Here it is.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Jimmy, I think you're right on.  If the cops are going to beat these savages out in the open, they need to at least drag  out the eight bells death pen. 
[04:06:00]  Miller?  Miller?  Wow.  A listener.  Very nice.  A listener gets it today.  All right.  We're out.  Bye.  Later.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony wow stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful  bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that wow stickers have many other uses?  I use wow stickers around the house to keep raccoons away from my garbage.  Come here, little fella.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's biting my balls.  Jesus Christ, my balls.  Ouch.  Ouch. 
[04:06:30]  My balls.  My balls are being bit by a raccoon here, people.  Dude.  Raccoon eating my balls here.  Raccoon on balls.  Anybody?  Do you see the raccoon dangling from my crotch?
