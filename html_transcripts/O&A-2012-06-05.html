<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a discussion about microphone preferences and a humorous anecdote involving host interactions with a coworker, "Fezzy," known for his persistent elevator greetings.  The conversation then veers towards sports, focusing on the NBA and NHL playoffs, with varied levels of host enthusiasm. A Maine TV station's blundering sports report about a basketball game ending in a tie is played, leading to mockery of the station's incompetence.  The hosts transition to a discussion of classic TV shows, aging, and nostalgia, which segues into a discussion of a "posty vac," a sexual enhancement device, leading to a phone call from "Phil," a fireman who details his experiences removing stuck cock rings. Further discussion ensues about various sexual enhancement products and the hosts' experiences with erectile dysfunction medications (Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra). Another caller, "Rick," shares a story about meeting the posty vac's inventor. The segment concludes with a discussion of a fan's field intrusion at a baseball game, Sue Simmons' impending departure from local news (attributed to on-air blunders), the irrelevance of local news in the digital age, and a missed opportunity to have Penn Jillette on the show.

The next segment begins with a discussion of a comedian's podcast promotion strategy, including potential appearances on Joe Rogan and Adam Carolla's podcasts, and further mention of Penn Jillette's size and the failed attempt to book him. This transitions to a news story about damage to the Enterprise space shuttle, leading to a discussion of *Apollo 13*, Bill Paxton's career, and the Hatfield and McCoy feud.  The hosts discuss booking Ralph Macchio (despite his initial reluctance), followed by a bizarre, repetitive chant of "Mimi Beardsley."  A possibly false Reagan-era anecdote is recounted, followed by criticism of Nancy Reagan and Sarah Jessica Parker's political endorsements, leading to commentary on the unemployment rate and Anthony's described "asshole" political take. The hosts critique Sarah Jessica Parker and Anna Wintour's Obama campaign commercials, with sexually explicit commentary on Wintour's appearance. The conversation further touches upon MTV Movie Awards ratings, *Game of Thrones*, Casey Anthony's weight and legal issues, George Zimmerman's upcoming trial, and Octomom's stripping career, resulting in more sexually explicit conversation. A comedian's hoax tweet about dining with Obama and Clooney is discussed, followed by a lengthy discussion of a proposed $100 million charity idea, more speculation about Casey Anthony and George Zimmerman, and a discussion of 80s movie soundtracks.  No studio guests were present during this segment.

The following segment starts with a discussion of obscure 80s music from films like *Beverly Hills Cop* and *Weird Science*, transitioning to a discussion of Colin Hanks (scheduled to appear the next day) and a past appearance with midgets and Jack Black. The hosts play several bizarre Miami 911 calls, detailing incidents involving a naked man, a fight, and a face-eating incident. A recording of an interview with a bath salts addict hallucinating about Jason Voorhees is played, leading to a discussion of bath salts and its effects.  Amy Schumer then joins as a guest. The conversation immediately pivots to Schumer recounting being fingered by a New York City cab driver while her friend slept in the back.  This story is discussed extensively with graphic details and humorous reactions. Schumer promotes her upcoming stand-up appearances before the segment concludes.

The next segment begins with further discussion of Amy Schumer's cab driver story and callers admitting to masturbating to it. A Montreal caller also confesses to masturbating while listening.  The conversation shifts to Amy Schumer's sexual experiences and preferences, including eye contact and orgasms during sex. The hosts then discuss being punched by UFC fighters, Uriah Faber and Jon Jones, referencing a video of Jimmy being punched by Faber on their Facebook page.  Unexpectedly, Ralph Macchio joins as a guest.  The conversation covers his career, including *The Karate Kid*, the "crane kick," *Happily Divorced*, a film with Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, and a National Geographic documentary on the American Gypsy community. Macchio shares anecdotes about working with Anthony Hopkins and experiences with fame.  The hosts and Macchio reminisce about his early career, including commercials and *Up the Academy*. The segment concludes with further promotion of Macchio's projects and Schumer's stand-up shows.

The final segment features Ralph Macchio and Amy Schumer as guests. It begins with a humorous anecdote about mistaking someone for Nick Jonas at an airport. Macchio discusses dealing with fans and constant photos. The conversation turns to sports, with Macchio sharing his opinions on the Jets and other New York teams. Amy Schumer interjects with more stories, including another about a cab driver touching her genitals.  The segment ends with promotional announcements for Macchio's *Happily Divorced*, Schumer's stand-up shows, and Macchio's upcoming Hitchcock movie. There is also mention of a man resembling a murderer being present in the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Ah. Ah. Morning.  I hate this. What?  Oh, you hate that?  Yeah, whoever uses this mic, who uses this?  Uh, Ronnie. Ronnie Biggs.  Ronnie likes this wire very tight.  The mic wire. I like it very loose.  I just let it up and then pull some out. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, so it spins.  It's a whole thing that happens.  Because I am very dynamic with the microphone.  I'll say you are. Like a panther.  Probably.  Ronnie B is pretty much, you know, he's right there like this.  What's up, Fezzy?  Hey there.  We haven't seen Ronnie in a long time.  I see Fezzy a lot, but no Ronnie.  Yeah, I see Fezzy outside sometimes when I'm walking in.  Yep. Doing his laps.  Yeah.  Round and round.  Round the building. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning, guys.  Surprised him this morning.  I pop out of the elevator and he's got a mouth full of something.  He goes,  Oh, really?  Yeah, I got a  Goombo.  Goombo.  Goombo.  Did I tell you guys, I'm not usually like a morning dude.  Like, I don't like to, I'm not like a big good morning.  Like, I got sleep in my eyes.  I just want to look at the floor and get the fuck away from me, you know?  Yeah.  And so I don't usually say, I don't play the good morning game with that guy.  Oh.  And sometimes he won't look and he just hears the elevator doors open, so he'll just say  it out of habit. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  And not really pay attention to who it is that he's saying the good morning to.  So, a few weeks ago, one morning, the doors open and I go to step out and I guess he  didn't know who was in the elevator and he goes, and then he saw it was me and it just  went, because he knows that I wasn't going to reciprocate, so he's like, fuck you, you're  not getting it.  He's not going to waste a good morning on someone that isn't going to appreciate it.  It really did fucking beat her out pretty quick.  You don't like to say hi to him?  Yeah.  You don't say hi to him?  No, fuck him.  Come on.  Come on. 
[00:02:00]  Come on.  He likes his basketball, that guy.  Does he?  Oh, big fucking time.  Yeah?  That's all he talks about.  He likes sports, but he especially likes basketball.  Yeah.  Which you don't like.  I'm not a big fan of the basketball.  There's some interesting things going on in the NBA right now, sir.  Oh, the never-ending playoffs?  Well, you got a 2-2 tie with the Celtics Heat series.  There's still a series going on?  Celtics are a very old team.  You mean they're not down to the last two teams?  Nope. 
[00:02:30]  Nope.  How many teams are still in it?  Four.  That's okay.  You got the Celtics Heat.  They're tied at two.  How long have the playoffs been going on?  For seven months, I think.  It's what it seems like.  I think it's seven months at this point.  This is crazy.  And then you got Oklahoma City there and the Spurs.  And the Spurs were supposed to kick their ass, and that's not happening.  So that's big news.  Durant and the boys are up three games to two over the Spurs,  who had a really nice run going until they hit Durant and the boys. 
[00:03:00]  So, boy, I know nothing about the basketball.  I think a lot of people were assuming it was going to be the Spurs and the Heat in the finals,  and that's definitely not a guarantee at this point.  Yeah.  So, game five of the Heat-Celtics series tonight.  You don't like basketball at all, huh?  No.  Just don't fucking.  Never got into it.  Can't get into it.  That stupid Jeremy Lin got me back into this dumb sport.  And then look what happened.  I went away for a long time.  Yeah.  And then I'm a huge hockey fan, and the Stanley Cup Finals is just a fucking bust. 
[00:03:30]  They play for, what, nine straight months?  It comes down to the finals, and it's three zip for the Kings.  And then the...  Who are a great team, by the way.  They're going to win this fucking thing, obviously.  Huh?  Semi-finals were pretty exciting.  Yeah, that was.  And then now it's just pretty much a blowout, right?  It's a blowout.  It's three games to Zippo there.  Yeah.  I think the Devils lost 4-0 last night, right?  Was that the final score?  I didn't watch the fucking game.  Yeah.  Being a huge hockey fan, I didn't watch. 
[00:04:00]  I heard on the news, a 4-0 rout.  Was it a 4-0 rout?  4-0 rout of the Devils.  This will be...  And it is going to happen.  It's going to be the first Stanley Cup for the LA Kings.  That's weird.  I never knew that.  I kind of thought they had one somewhere, but no.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's your sports break.  There you go.  There's your sports.  Actually, we got a dummy.  We can play right off the bat.  Ooh.  Maine TV station.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  All the way up there in Maine. 
[00:04:30]  We went to Maine once.  Yeah.  One time.  Sunday River.  Sunday River, right.  Sunday River skiing in Maine.  With the outdoor fucking pool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That thing rules.  It was pretty fucking cool.  Wasn't it a huge pool?  Yeah.  I feel like it was a really big...  Pool size.  It was like an Olympic-sized pool?  Yeah.  Outside and heated like a motherfucker.  Heated.  It's like, what?  Maybe 15 degrees, but the pool was nice.  It was cold as a motherfucker out there.  Like, very cold.  And then stupid, crazy Jim decided to start the skinny dipping. 
[00:05:00]  I chose not to partake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was embarrassed of my wee-wee.  They didn't get some severe shrinkage coming out of it.  Yeah.  You got to make sure your wee-wee's ready for fucking skinny dipping.  Yeah.  You just don't assume it's going to be all right.  You got to plump up.  Mm-hmm.  You got to pull a pre-plump.  How do you pre-plump?  You just kind of work it.  Rub a little.  You fucking think about something in your head.  You go, oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well.  All right.  Let me go with that thought for a little while.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Not too much.  Not too much. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no, I ruined it with too much.  You can't look like you're doing something.  You want the girl to try to figure it out.  Is that natural?  Is that?  Or did he?  Wow.  I'm not really.  Did he plump up?  Yeah.  And the second it twitches, all bets are off.  Right.  You can't get it to the point where it's twitching.  Right.  Then you look like a doofus.  Then you're like, oh, no.  Then you look a little too desperate for the situation.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway, Maine TV did this.  Now, News 8 Sports.  The Boston Celtics hosting the Miami Heat in Boston for game four of the Eastern Conference 
[00:06:00]  Finals.  I guess the game just ended.  It ended in a tie.  This is what my producer is telling me right now.  There you go.  There's the score.  89 went down to the wire.  21 seconds left.  Ended in a tie.  All right.  Let's move on to professional baseball.  This is the people telling you the news.  Wow.  It doesn't get much better if it's a bigger market like New York City. 
[00:06:30]  We laugh at them, too.  It is Maine.  But, yeah, I've seen some huge mistakes in New York.  I love it.  Well, nope.  It ended in a tie.  There you go.  Ended in a tie.  There you go.  Wow.  How do you get into broadcasting and don't know the basics of shit?  I don't expect you to know all the players on the team or any of that, but you don't  even know that basketball games can't end in a tie.  And it's great because it's not even just her.  She was told that by somebody. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  So they both are idiots.  There's two dummies.  You know what?  Good point.  Very good point.  Yeah.  So there's two dummies working there.  Let's listen to that again.  Now, News 8 Sports.  The Boston Celtics hosting the Miami Heat in Boston for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference  Finals.  I guess the game just ended.  It ended in a tie.  This is what my producer is telling me right now.  There you go.  There's the score.  89 went down to the water.  So the producer, her, three people, and the one that keys in the fucking information for 
[00:07:30]  the score.  Yeah.  So that's three people that are dummies right off the bat.  I guess it ended in a tie.  Yeah.  Oh, brother.  Great.  I found a great new channel.  Really?  On the TV.  Yeah.  It's like this station out of Connecticut.  Just a regular broadcast station.  It's on cable?  It's on Fios.  Yes.  The Fios carries it. 
[00:08:00]  It's this Me TV.  And it's all old shows.  Oh, boy.  Just old shows from the 70s and stuff.  That's right down your...  And so I was watching like The Rifleman.  Why?  I don't know.  I was watching The Rifleman.  Wasn't that Chuck Conner?  Chuck Conner's.  And at the beginning, it's the coolest segment in the beginning.  Because he's got his fucking Winchester rifle, right?  Yeah.  And he goes...  He's like doing the fucking lever action cocky firing it. 
[00:08:30]  And then it goes...  And the music starts.  And he starts loading it while he's walking down the street.  And as he's loading it, he peeks at the camera.  He kind of looks at you like...  Hey, how you doing?  That was pretty fucking badass, wasn't it?  Hey, how you doing?  Badass.  And then they play all the fucking Quincy.  They play fucking The Odd Couple.  I was on to The Odd Couple last night.  And it was this very happy, nostalgic kind of thing.  And then every commercial is for Hover Round and Erectile Dysfunction and fucking Cancer 
[00:09:00]  of the Ass and...  Welcome to your future.  I know.  They can't just leave it all nice and let me watch Hogan's Heroes.  Why can't they have all the nice commercials that happen?  Of the time.  Show me some Mattel Incredible Edibles commercial.  I know everyone's desperate to fucking make money constantly, but that would be a great  network.  Where it's the old shows with the old commercials they used to fucking play at the time.  Come on, posty back.  What's a posty back?  That's how you put it on your dick to make a boner. 
[00:09:30]  Look, there's the creepy guy spinning the girl on the swing.  The woman.  It's one of those suck machines?  Yes.  Fuck that.  Yeah, we did the audio for this a little bit ago.  Ew, what's he doing?  Why is he spinning her?  Did you see us spinning her on the tire?  He's being playful.  These are all guys that can't get rods.  Come on.  Petey Green can't get his dick hard.  Good old Petey Green.  The posty back.  Let's listen to that audio.  Posty back.  I will never fucking put a suck machine on my dick.  I do.  I call her a woman.  Oh, God. 
[00:10:00]  You can get it hard.  Need a little volume.  Get the fuck out of here.  Where's the audio?  Why is she in an inner tube?  No audio?  No audio.  Oh, is there no audio on that?  No audio.  No, there should be.  Oh, there we go.  Okay, let's go back.  It's bad audio.  Is there another version of it?  Yeah, let's find another version of that.  Get the posty back.  There's a guy spinning his woman in a tire swing, but he's laying directly under it and  poking her with his fingers.  He's poking her.  All right.  Yeah.  Not too awake. 
[00:10:30]  They're all...  They're all...  Because they can't show the hard cat going in a vagina, so they have to do other things  visually.  That's what it is.  As they're kind of like talking about what this thing does.  Be all you can be with posty back.  Is that how they were talking?  Everybody's a creepy ghoul.  Oh, keep your limp dick away from my television, you fucking piece of shit.  I tweeted about it over the weekend.  You see the Cialis commercial where she runs out in the rain, and I tweeted that that just  has to mean that's sperm.  Oh, really? 
[00:11:00]  Why else would they do that?  Like you think the rain represents cum?  All of a sudden, she just runs out in the rain all happy, like it's now raining sperm  because my fucking douchebag husband can get boners, man.  Maybe.  Oh, you found one.  Oh, here it is.  Yeah, right.  This is for the posty vac.  Yeah.  This is for a way to dramatically improve your sexual performance with posty vac.  Post.  Posty vac.  Medically approved therapy.  Medically approved therapy.  Simply apply the gentle suction of the posty vac system.  What's he doing?  He's above him in an inner tube spinning around. 
[00:11:30]  Foking her.  Wait, how long does it take?  Can we go back?  I want to see.  Within four.  You'll experience complete sexual performance.  Yeah.  Guaranteed.  Simply apply the gentle suction of the posty vac system, and within four minutes, you'll  experience complete sexual performance.  Four minutes?  Can we try this shit?  Oh, I guess what you got to do.  Yeah.  I guess.  Could you pause a second?  I guess what you do is.  Hey, let's have a competition.  What's the competition?  Who can get harder, faster with the posty vac? 
[00:12:00]  With the posty vac.  Get posty vacs in here.  That's a fun game.  We should have a posty vac or two.  Can we do this?  I'll share one.  Yeah, let's share one.  We'll have to go to the website.  We're going to have to do it.  See if we get both our dicks in there.  We're going to have to do it on the honor system, though.  We'll take turns and see who can get it hard the fastest from the posty vac.  Oh, the posty vac.  The posty vac.  Yeah, you pump it up, and then I guess there's a big rubber ring at the bottom, and after it's  pumped up, you slide the rubber O-ring off of the bottom of the posty vac onto your 
[00:12:30]  dick, and it, like, squeezes it like a fucking balloon party balloon.  Yeah, exactly.  That's got to hurt.  It's supposed to hold the shit in there, the blood in there, so you could fuck, and  then after you fucking cum, you take the ring off.  Do you ever do a cock ring?  Yes.  I've never done that.  Why?  It just looks silly.  It looks like it hurts.  It does.  It looks, you're right, it does look silly.  It looks kind of silly.  But it gives, like, dicks get hard, but when you have a fucking, yes.  I mean, we all get hard on it, but when you have a fucking ring around the bottom, when 
[00:13:00]  it's comfortable, like, if it's not comfortable, sometimes it just grabs your dick skin, and  it's all, it's like wearing a fucking tight turtleneck sweater.  But when it's comfortable, when you have it fitted around your dick and balls, and it's  a rubber one, like an O-ring, it fucking, you're, the turgidity of your dick.  Oh, my precious.  You're afraid to touch the tip, because you're afraid it's just going to burst with blood all  over the fucking, it's a good rod.  Really?  No, no, it's a good rod.  So maybe these Posse-Vac people are getting big rods.  Yeah, but that's basically just a cock ring, but you've got to put it over your balls, 
[00:13:30]  and they're a little uncomfortable.  Are you kidding?  That's where you put it?  No, no, I mean, you, you, you, you.  Like, behind the nuts?  Yeah, of course, to hold all the blood.  You feel silly, because your balls are all crunched up.  It looks like, uh, you, you're, like, your arms and legs are out.  Pointing.  Yeah, see, I couldn't do that, man.  Oh, God.  Yeah, see, I don't know what that tie-off is on the end.  It's got a wire around it.  Yeah, that's a fucking...  That's a homemade.  That's a, yeah, give me, show me a real cock.  I've had a couple that vibrate, which I didn't like. 
[00:14:00]  No, that's too much.  That's fucking crescent.  That's a belt.  That's a, that's a strap-on, Derek.  That's, yeah.  That's suspenders for your dick.  All right, how about...  Oh, God.  Oh, that's good.  That's a big metal one.  One ring to rule them all.  That's what it looks like around his fucking cock.  A rubber one grips.  Yeah, that's even looks painful.  Am I led to believe there's one there that actually has a ball that goes up your ass?  Is that what that one is?  Where?  Oh, top row.  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck is... 
[00:14:30]  That looks great.  This is the Titus Stainless Steel Cock Ring and Double Anal Ball.  Oh, wow.  What's that called?  From the Fun Collection.  I don't know.  I don't understand that.  Stainless steel?  Wow.  Well, you don't want shit all staining up your toys.  No, but I want rubber.  I want a rubber, like a hard rubber.  You want a little bit of elasticity in there.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want stainless steel around my dick.  How about that?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I have.  I would just feel like...  I don't know.  I would look stupid.  You feel a little...  It does.  Or silly.  But when you're fucking and a girl doesn't care, it's almost like when a girl isn't as 
[00:15:00]  wet, if she has to lick her pussy or whatever, or you have to lick your hand or lick  her...  The split head shit.  What is that about?  Why are you cutting your dick head in half?  Who are you mad at?  Wow.  Someone's really pissed.  Everybody, right?  Yeah, that's just mad.  Why would you do that?  I don't know, but it's hard to look at.  Your dick is so sacred, and then you fucking take a blade to it and cut the head in half?  I don't get that.  Looks like those hot dogs that split on the grill. 
[00:15:30]  What is that about, though?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  Besides, a lot of anger?  It is a lot of anger at your penis.  You're very angry at your penis.  Is it a thing, though, for something we don't understand?  I don't know.  I can't watch it.  I never understand the bifurcation.  Yeah.  Oh.  Where are we at with the rest of the pasta vet?  Oh, yeah, the pasta vet.  We've got to hear the creepy guys.  We're at PD.  Giving the testicle monials.  First time around, I'm going, wow, it really works.  Now, you and the one you love can enjoy complete sexual pleasure and satisfaction anytime with no pills. 
[00:16:00]  No doctor visits.  Posty vac is a clinically proven vacuum.  A guy comes over.  Yeah.  Hey, I just popped my cock up.  Let's go.  And there are no harmful side effects.  We're on the clock.  It's so safe and effective.  Yeah, because it's got to be like a tire with a slow leak, you know?  You're right, man.  They're all creeps.  Yeah.  You pay nothing up front. 
[00:16:30]  So there's no waiting for reimbursement.  We even take care of the paperwork for you.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, thank you.  That's the only way to go.  I'm telling you, I've tried everything, and I know if you don't give a fuck.  Did you try a hot girl?  You're going to be all you can be, or you're not going to be all you can be.  And this helps you be all you can be.  He's a rapist.  He pumps up before he rapes.  Yeah.  Dial this 1-800 number after this commercial.  Why take the best part of life out of your life?  Bonus. 
[00:17:00]  So what?  These guys can't do dick pills?  I don't know.  They've got some medical issues.  It's quite too expensive or whatever.  Yeah, they don't want to take a pill.  Who wants to take a pill?  You can see my hand go up in the back.  Posty vac is covered by Medicare and most insurance companies.  I bet if you fucking, I bet if you dangled a fucking girl in front of these guys that  wasn't their dumb fuck wives, they would get a rod.  Do you think it's just the wife?  Oh, of course it is.  Complete confidence and sexual performance with the posty vac. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know, man.  Vacuum, you dick.  I know this.  We should get one and have some kind of competition.  Well, absolutely.  We should figure out something.  We've got to order some posty vacs.  Yeah.  I wonder how much they cost.  Yeah, let's do a little Google Gander.  That's what I call it.  I'm going Googling for something.  Google Gander?  Yeah, I'm going Googling.  Yeah.  It's just all full of all that stuff.  What about the, you know what?  Also, I see that other commercial. 
[00:18:00]  They're showing a graphic, an animation.  Of how it works.  Of how the posty vac works.  And they've got a computer-generated rod.  And they're showing the blood flow with arrows going through it.  Wow.  As soon as you take that ring off.  Back to nothing.  Wow, that's funny.  That is funny.  Back to nothing.  Oh, boy.  And then they've got to show these erectile dysfunction commercials with guys for either Cialis or Viagra. 
[00:18:30]  Where they're a real manly man.  They know what to do in manly situations.  But I can't get a rod.  I'd rather be able to get a rod than know that I've got to put water in my radiator of my vehicle.  That guy's driving around.  He's like, yeah.  He goes to the gas station.  Bum, bum.  Playing like the cool music.  He points at the guy at the gas station.  He's like, yeah, I know to put some water in my radiator.  You're at an age where you know how to get things done.  Except the fucking boner.  Can't get a fucking boner.  You can do everything except procreate the species, which turtles can do. 
[00:19:00]  I would imagine it's got to suck, but I'm in a vacuum, though?  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  And then they show that the woman making the bed in the background of one of the shots.  And it's kind of a depth of field thing.  She's out of focus.  And then in focus is the night table with the poste vac just sitting on it.  Like, that's really got to get the woman all excited. 
[00:19:30]  Of course.  Oh, the poste vac's out.  You know there's a few pubic hairs on the poste vac?  Oh, God.  Poste or post?  Poste vac.  But there's no I in the thing.  It's poste vac.  Oh, I got it.  Poste vac.  Like Mr. T.  Let's go to Phil in D.C.  Phil?  Phil Connors?  Hey.  Come on, guys.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, I'm a farmer down here.  And usually a couple times a year we get sent down to the hospital because there's someone 
[00:20:00]  with a stainless steel cock ring that we have to cut off with a wizard saw.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Ah.  Wait, so how?  What happened?  He has to cut cock rings off guys a couple times a year.  What?  What?  Are they doing?  Are they doing pills or something, too, and they just can't get the dicks off?  Yeah, I guess.  They get too tight or whatever, and they can't get it off.  So the hospital will call us, and we've got to go down, and it's usually a long process.  We've got to cut it off, and then we don't have to stay there and spray water on it because 
[00:20:30]  it keeps up on the guy.  What do you use, yeah, what do you use to cut it off with, a grinder or something?  Yeah, like a wizard saw, like a grinder, like you cut it off with.  Holy shit.  And what do you, like, you've got to put something in between.  Yeah, we actually have, we made, we usually take, like, old spoons from the firehouse,  and we flatten them with a hammer and stick it in between.  The guy's got to feel like a real ass.  Or, yeah, especially if he's a little awful dick.  But to have firemen working on your cock would be pretty cool. 
[00:21:00]  Firemen's working on your cock.  Tell my boys, fix this.  Free this.  Free my cock.  But, yeah, that's the event.  They're always metal ones, right, bro?  What's that?  They're always metal ones?  Yeah, they're usually stainless steel.  So, uh, I wasn't working, but the worst one they ever had was a, uh, a guy took, like,  a lead weight.  He put on, like, a, you know, bar you lift weights with.  He put his whole cock and balls to it and got it stuck.  It took him a couple hours to cut that off.  Hey, man. 
[00:21:30]  That's a rough one.  How come their dicks won't go soft after that?  I guess the blood can't get out.  Oh, okay.  Man.  Yeah, I let the little...  It'll rot off.  The rubber one that Danny clicked on, it's a hard rubber, but you can manipulate it off.  Yeah.  So you can stretch it.  You can stretch it a little bit.  The fear is that when you're putting it on, you're going to let it snap, and it's going  to land on your ball of dick.  Well, why ruin a good cock ring?  Why don't you guys just slice the dick off and save the cock ring?  I don't know.  Or slice the side of it with a razor and it'll blood let. 
[00:22:00]  Or get some saliva on it.  Yeah.  It'll pay me enough for that.  Yeah, I guess not.  Or show the guy a girl.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Exactly.  I know.  Straight guys are using them, too.  All right, Phil.  Thank you.  All right.  Good punch now.  Thank you.  Phil in Washington, D.C. there.  Have a good day.  I've had some good sex with a cock ring on, man.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  I've had some.  I don't know, man.  Just fuck.  Never done it.  You put a little bit of fucking oil on your dick and you fucking...  A little oil. 
[00:22:30]  A little oil.  Put a little oil on there and you start fucking.  It's great.  Let's do some fucking.  You ever use the one with the little...  It's got the little vibrator thing on top?  I have.  I didn't like it.  I don't need all the bells and whistles.  Just give me a little ring to wrap around my dick.  It looks silly.  It looks like a Shakespeare cock.  But yeah, I didn't care for that.  I didn't need all the...  No.  It's not for you.  Oh, well...  It's for her pleasure.  It's for her pleasure.  Well, if it's for her pleasure, they'd get her a better dick.  Get her a real cock in there.  No accessories to tickle your fucking taint? 
[00:23:00]  No, I don't need any of that stuff.  If I wanted to get her pleasure, I'd let Ant fuck for me.  Hop in there, Ant.  Yeah, you know, that's...  I have no ambition to use the cock ring.  I really don't really want to...  You want to take a pill?  No.  No.  I don't like the pills.  I don't know.  Those are fun.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to have that extra oomph. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a weird...  Sometimes it's just like you feel like Superman, really.  It's just like you have a cock of steel.  A cock of steel.  And you can break things with it.  That powerful.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to get back to being Clark Kent.  I don't need to be Superman.  I just want to go from being Christopher Reeve at the end of his life to Clark Kent.  One time I got...  It wasn't like prescription.  Like there were these over-the-counter things.  And I didn't buy them.  They were given to me.  And I just figured I would throw them away because I'm like, am I really going to take 
[00:24:00]  these fucking things?  And I figured, let me give this a shot because let me see what happens.  Is this really a rip-off?  Like how am I ever going to know?  So I took them by myself and I was just sitting there watching TV.  Oh, no.  And my dick was raging hard for about three and a half hours.  It was like...  It was fantastic.  It really worked.  Well, I did some research.  It was called Rock Hard Weekend.  Rock Hard Weekend.  And I'll tell you, it definitely worked.  And I'll say that with a D in the past tense because I think there was a little investigation 
[00:24:30]  involved.  And it turns out the active ingredient of Viagra was in these things.  So the FDA came down pretty hard.  You can't get them in the same way anymore.  Rock Hard Weekend.  Boy, oh boy.  Those things worked.  Yeah.  And then you're all alone with a fucking rod.  Hey, man.  I don't care.  There's a lot of porno out there, my friend.  There's a lot of porno.  You ever walk around by yourself with a fucking Viagra rod and just look at yourself in the  mirror?  You just walk by and you stop?  Like, this is what a girl would see if I just walked into the room with my fucking  raging boner. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, shit.  I'd snap fucking...  You gotta take photos.  I do.  Yeah, you gotta.  Oh, please.  Yeah, you'd snap some pics.  I got a good one, yeah.  I do it from the angle in the mirror.  Well, obviously.  But I don't do it from the above angle.  I do it from the mirror so I get the perspective of the body.  And I have the shirt to cover my stomach.  You gotta get the forced perspective.  Yeah.  I don't want anybody to see my fucking gut.  Aw.  It's not much of a gut.  Yeah, but it's still enough to take away from the...  What's the word? 
[00:25:30]  Picturesque.  Or action.  The rod.  Yeah, but those things are cool.  I wish I could still get them in the same formula.  Give Viagra.  But Viagra fucks you up that day.  Like, Viagra makes you very, very intensely hard.  But it makes you very congested and you see weird blue streaks.  Jesus.  I don't need that shit.  And a bad headache.  So why don't you take a little bit of it then?  Yeah, you can.  But I think it all kind of affects you that way.  Cialis can last for up to three days in your system, which I like.  Like, two days later, a girl says hi.  And you're like, what the fuck? 
[00:26:00]  This is what it's like to be a male?  No, Cialis is better than Viagra?  Not immediately.  Like, if you've got a fuck in an hour, take a Viagra.  Cialis, though, if you're planning ahead.  If you're going on a date tonight and it's, like, in the afternoon.  And you just want it in your system.  It works very fucking well.  Levitra kind of fell off the map, it seems.  No one talks about Levitra.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm...  That's the RC Cola of erection pills.  Yeah.  I almost said the tab, but I realized you covered it with RC Cola.  Why don't you repeat the joke with a different soda? 
[00:26:30]  I tried them.  They're all fun.  Yeah.  Nothing beats just the regular old classic Viagra, I think.  Yeah.  Just take it at worst.  It's hard to come on them sometimes, though, if you take too much.  It can be difficult to come.  I don't come into quantities like that.  Let me go to Rick.  He actually met the inventor of the aposty bag.  Oh.  Is this true, Rick, or you just want to get on the radio today?  No, no, no.  I was working for a movie company, and we had to move some stuff for him.  And this guy, he lives like in a warehouse. 
[00:27:00]  On one side is the warehouse.  On the other side, he rebuilt it all so he can...  I mean, it looks like it's in the worst part of town, and it's just...  I mean, the guy's...  I mean, like I said, he showed us the invention and everything.  And we had to move like a 2,000-pound safe up these creekly all stairs because he's cheap.  Cheap as hell.  Well, he's probably not selling a lot of aposty bags because you got dick pills.  Yeah.  I mean, his car...  He's got like a nice car, and it's all cracked up. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  These guys are rat.  Yeah, you really are a rat.  Just a busybody.  All right, thank you, Rick.  That's not even good info.  He's like, his car sucks.  His car sucks.  He's got a safe.  By the way, Rock Card Weekend is for sale at every truck stop.  Yeah, exactly.  But if the asshole that feedbacked in would have listened to me in the first place, they changed  the formula.  Whatever the active ingredient is, like pseudonephro or whatever, it's not in there anymore.  It's not going to work.  They did that to one of our big sponsors.  Yes.  I forgot the...  What was that? 
[00:28:00]  Some weight loss thing or some speed thing.  It was probably Stacker 2.  Stacker 2, yeah.  Stacker 2 was a massive advertiser on our show for many years at NW.  People loved it.  It was fucking like crack.  It was fucking coke pills.  Yeah.  And then the FDA caught up with them.  One time I ate so many, I thought my heart was going to explode.  Yeah.  I think that's why they changed it, because some people did.  Yeah.  So they continued to sell it, but they changed it all around.  Yeah, and it didn't work as good.  I don't think so.  It was fun, I think.  I think.  I'm not sure.  I don't feel like I'm going to sue those assholes. 
[00:28:30]  I don't know.  I have no idea.  People buy all this stuff because it works.  Because it works, and then they go, hey, this stuff works too good, and then they fuck  it all up.  They fuck it up.  They nerf it.  They nerf that shit.  So you're watching this new fucking show?  Yeah, I was very excited about some of the old programs.  The Odd Couple, fucking fun.  The episode was on last night where Oscar saves Felix's life, and Felix is indebted to  Oscar, and just the whole episode is sort of a basic story that has been done a thousand 
[00:29:00]  times where now Oscar's trying to make it look like he's in a life-threatening situation  so Felix can save him, and they could say, well, we're even, but every time Oscar does  it, Felix falls into a situation where his life is threatened again, and Oscar has to  save him again.  That's a funny fucking idea for a show.  It's just so goddamn funny.  And those two are just ridiculously funny.  And yeah, Murray was in that episode.  How many years was that on?  Oh, man. 
[00:29:30]  How many original episodes?  Oh, fucking no.  Back then, shows didn't last as long as they do today.  I don't know.  Now these shows could go, what, eight, ten years?  Easy.  Back then, it was three or four tops for some of these.  I want to say 60, I'll say 68 to 74.  Oh, wow.  Or thereabouts.  Okay.  I don't know.  But yeah, there's all those shows.  But like I said, the hover round takes me where I want to go.  Where will it send me? 
[00:30:00]  They went to the Grand Canyon.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they went to the Grand Canyon with a hover round.  And went off-roading with it.  Some of these new vehicle things for the elderly, because there's many different ones.  Yeah.  They're getting some shit done out there.  Are they?  I see people tolling down the sidewalk.  And some of them, these things go so fast, they're in the road.  Oh, very dangerous.  And just flying along with traffic.  Very dangerous.  There's one old lady I'm trying to film so bad.  But I feel like she goes 30 miles an hour. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  I can't keep up with her.  And she does it in the road.  She says, fuck this sidewalk.  I've got to get some speed.  I bet she's not allowed to be on the road.  I don't know which one it is.  But maybe she, what, took the governor out, remember?  Took the governor.  Took the governor out.  Go a lot faster.  Yeah, disconnected the governor.  I don't know.  But this thing I see every once in a while goes flying down the street.  I don't think it's a hover around, though.  There's that.  There's that.  Yeah, and you're watching the show.  You're all fucking laughing.  It's fucking nostalgic fun. 
[00:31:00]  And then, of course, Life Call comes on.  You know, you press the button.  And they got the fucking bathtub with the fucking door on it.  So you got to get in, shut the fucking watertight door.  Look how badass that wheelchair looks.  It's got a wheelie bar on it.  Look at that fucking truck tires.  That's like a wheelchair?  That's a mini truck tire.  Wow.  That's badass.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  That thing hits 15 miles an hour.  You know what?  Damn. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Fucking cranking.  All right.  You can do some things with that.  Look at this.  45-mile range.  Look, sand, snow, real outdoor capability.  45-mile range.  That's pretty good.  I'm going to pitch an idea right now.  What do you mean?  We get one of those, and we get a posty vac, and we get hard-ons, and we ride down the boss's  offices with our boners.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  We joust with our boners.  Let's do some jousting.  We drive down the office.  Yeah, we just ride around.  The office is really fast with our fucking posty vac hard-ons. 
[00:32:00]  Waving them at everybody.  We tell people, you have to blow in it to control them.  Posty vac boner.  Man, what else is going on?  Oh, man.  What the hell else was last night?  I went to bed like 8.30, so I missed everything.  If anything cool was going on last night, I fucking missed it.  I fucked my sleep up.  That's why I was up late watching all these dumb-ass shows.  Yeah?  Yeah, like, crapped down on the couch at like 4 p.m. and woke up at like 8 at night. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  And just looked and said, okay, I'm screwed.  And I was up until about 3 in the morning.  Last thing that was on was like Mission Impossible, the original one, you know, the TV series,  which I crack up when they're like, they're trying to drill a hole in a wall where somebody is in the room.  Right.  And all they did was like just not record the sound of the drill.  They're trying to make it seem like a secret agent drill, like a special one.  And all you see is the drill's bit going around and making a hole in the wall, but it's not making a sound.  And the guy's just at his desk, he doesn't see a big hole being drilled because it's a secret fucking special IM force drill. 
[00:33:00]  Even though it's the exact same drill everyone has.  Yeah, it's a regular fucking drill.  They didn't record the sound.  But it's their, you know, soundless drill.  That's cheap sound effect.  Yeah.  And then Combat.  Combat.  I love Combat with Vic Morrow.  I don't remember that one.  Whoopsie.  Yeah, that was like an old black and white World War II show.  There's so many of those old fucking shows.  They play the Honeymooners.  Like, they got all the old shows. 
[00:33:30]  I'm just ending up to be one of those fucking, like Howard Hughes guys that just sits in his house and watches these old fucking TV shows.  But the TV shows were way better back then.  I know.  Well, you know, you could sound bad saying that.  Are we sounding like our parents?  I agree, but you just sound silly saying shit like that.  Especially the funny shit.  The sitcoms and stuff.  Because they didn't have the PC crap to deal with as much.  It actually, like a lot of the shows weren't very good.  I watched an episode of Canon. 
[00:34:00]  Not very good.  Not good, huh?  Canon.  So it doesn't hold up.  No, it doesn't hold up.  I would assume sitcoms hold up because funny is funny.  It's the nostalgia angle of it.  Yeah.  And you realize that every fucking guest star was somebody you recognized.  Like, it's just somebody.  It's like, oh, that guy.  Like, I was watching.  I watched Gunsmoke.  And Nick Nolte was in it.  Fucking Nick Nolte.  And he wasn't even like the big guest star of it.  He gets shot.  Nick Nolte.  Did a good job.  Spun around.  How many shows did you watch? 
[00:34:30]  I watched a fuckload of old shows.  Obviously.  All day long.  All day long.  Gunsmoke.  It was some fucking sheriff went like bat shit in a town.  And they threw him out.  And he didn't want to be thrown out.  So he came back with his guns.  Oh, no.  So it shouldn't be.  Oh, blazing.  And the sheriff that went bat shit was like Paul Engel's best friend from Little House  on the Prairie.  And Nick Nolte's in it.  And then fucking some guy I recognized from Star Trek.  Like, they all just had.  It was all one big happy family back then.  Nice. 
[00:35:00]  Every guest star was somebody.  I'd watch some of those shows.  Yeah.  It was kind of fucking cool to watch.  A lot of those shows definitely have gone away.  They'd just be on, what, Channel 11 here in New York?  Yeah, Channel 11, Channel 5.  Now they're relegated to these exclusive, like, I guess there's another channel called  Antenna.  I don't know.  I never heard of that one either.  I guess, what's the other one?  Fuck, that used to be Nick at Night.  And they turned it to TV Land.  Oh, TV Land.  TV Land is another one that plays all the old shows.  Isn't Ralph Macchio doing something for TV Land? 
[00:35:30]  I think that's why he's here today, huh?  That's why he's here today.  I'm confused by Ralph Macchio because I met him at a Jets game.  Yeah.  And he's very aware of us, very aware of the show.  He even said, fellow Long Islanders, doing well.  Yes.  And he goes, but I'll never do your show.  And he's polite about it.  He goes, I just don't do those type of shows.  And I made the pitch, like, look, you know, we're not like we used to be, blah, blah.  He goes, oh, that's all well and good, but I'll never do your show.  Yeah, see.  He was nice, though.  He was very nice. 
[00:36:00]  And I see he's booked, so I wonder what changed.  Maybe he heard it.  Maybe someone that he knows heard it and realized we're not quite as nasty to the guests as we used to be.  I didn't bring anything to get signed by him.  I'm so stupid.  What's wrong with you?  You should have brought something from the Karate Kid.  I had a Karate Kid.  Up the Academy.  He was, I didn't realize it was his first movie.  He played Chooch.  Wow.  That was a funny movie done by Mad Magazine.  Yeah.  And Ron Liebman.  Ron Liebman.  Say it again.  Started in that. 
[00:36:30]  There was some very funny moments in Up the Academy by...  I don't think I've even seen that.  It's, he goes to this military academy and Ron Liebman plays the head of the academy.  And, you know, it's the typical romp type, like, you know, these young guys cause a problem at the academy.  It was 1980.  It was fucking, I fucking howled.  Like a Porky's type of a thing.  Young youngsters making things run amok.  Yeah, that was Ron Liebman's big line.  He kept, he would always repeat that.  Say it again.  Say it again.  It was actually, yeah, yeah, it was very funny. 
[00:37:00]  Ron Liebman.  Ron Liebman.  I forget who else was in it.  There's another name in there besides Ron Machio that I recognized.  What's the Machio doing today?  Do we have something on that?  He's happily divorced.  It's the season finale tomorrow at 10.30.  He's promoting that.  Oops.  All right.  All right.  And that's TV land, I guess.  Good.  TV land.  Hey, quick update on that guy in the Gary Carter jersey that ran out on the field.  Oh, man, I read this, yeah.  After the no-hitter.  Oh, boy. 
[00:37:30]  He missed his son's first birthday while he was in jail.  He got arrested for running out on the field.  And apparently, yeah, his son's first birthday he spent in jail.  That's going to fuck things up.  That's a big family moment, that first birthday.  Yeah.  Even though the kid's not going to remember.  Well, yeah.  But everyone else will remember that the father wasn't there because he needed to run on the field.  The kid will know.  The kid will know because his friends and relatives will tell him.  And I guess they ban you for life, huh? 
[00:38:00]  Oh, right.  You get thrown out of the park for life.  But how do they know?  In the end, yeah.  Fucking hundreds of thousands of people running through that place.  You take a year off, you put a hat on, I guarantee you're getting back in.  How are they going to know?  They won't.  Never know.  Well, they have a face scanning technology at Citi Field.  Oh.  No, they don't.  I saw your eyes.  But they were good.  Yeah, how do they know, though?  Woman from the wedding.  Identifies it as four faces.  And big face look woman from the wedding.  It's like four different people come up. 
[00:38:30]  Giant face.  Giant face.  Giant face.  Made me laugh again yesterday.  It's Mount Rushmore.  Jimmy talking about giant face from San Francisco.  Yeah.  So he's banned for life.  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  And he missed his son's first birthday because he had to jump on the field and not think.  Did we try to talk to that guy?  Did we call him?  I would like to talk to that guy.  He was in jail.  Doesn't everyone know you get arrested for jumping on the field?  There's no fucking exceptions.  It was a Friday game.  They will catch you and you will get arrested.  And you will go to jail. 
[00:39:00]  And you will go to jail.  For what?  A day?  Who cares?  It was Friday night though.  So the weekend.  Yeah.  But if it's your fucking kid's first birthday, perhaps you should think of that first.  Wow.  But I can see where you would take that.  I don't know.  I don't like the idea of having a fucking record.  Having a fucking arrest record.  You know?  Maybe if you have one already.  But it's a dumb one.  Still.  Even, you know, potential employers would have to respect that.  Even so.  You've been arrested.  They would go, oh, you got arrested?  Yeah.  And then you explain why.  And they're like, oh, all right. 
[00:39:30]  That's not that bad.  Yeah.  Jeez, man.  I don't know.  Maybe not.  Keep a clean record.  Sue Simmons is leaving next week.  Do you think they're tired of her fucking up?  What happened there?  She really fucked up a couple times, but they make it a huge deal.  She's, Sue Simmons is the, is the, she had black and half white, or is she black?  I don't even know.  She's got a little white in her, it looks like.  Highest paid anchor?  Local anchor, yeah.  No, in the country.  Local anchors, yeah.  Yes.  Really?  In the country, yeah.  She's pretty much the highest paid one. 
[00:40:00]  What do you think she makes?  I don't know.  $800,000 or more?  Probably a mil.  No?  Probably over a mil.  Yeah, I would think.  What was her last, what was her last fuck up?  She took a softball to her tit or something?  Do you have that one, Iraq?  It happened only a week or two ago.  Oh, again?  She had another one?  You weren't here, maybe?  No, probably not.  I'm surprised, uh, Ernie and Estes, right?  Yeah.  Said keep fucking that, was it Ernie and Estes?  Yes, keep fucking that chicken.  How did that not even, that was a slip.  That got nothing.  I know.  That got like, it didn't even. 
[00:40:30]  Keep fucking that chicken.  The best part is the confidence he had.  He had no idea he was fucking up.  He'd fucking that chicken.  Yeah, he had no idea he did fuck up, even after he said it.  And nothing.  Is this the tit one?  Because there's a difference.  When you say keep fucking instead of plucking, people know what you meant.  A verbal slip like that is allowed.  Right.  They don't kill you for that.  If you slip and you go, I went out and I fucked this girl, they'll kill you for it.  But keep fucking that chicken.  No one thinks you meant keep fucking that chicken.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  It hit me in my breast.  Oh, can you start?  All right, fucked up. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, this is her last fuck up.  The ball took a bad hop and hit me in my breast.  Are we on?  The inquestion, an urgent call for action.  Ah, who cares?  It's a good thing she didn't say tit.  Yeah.  She said breast.  That's fine.  And what was the other one?  She thought she was recording a promo, but it was one of those live promos they do?  Yes, that was it.  You got that one at least, D-Rock?  Yeah, that was a good one.  All right, hit that.  At 11, pay more at the grocer, but getting less. 
[00:41:30]  We'll tell you how to get the most.  What the fuck are you doing?  I like Sue Simmons.  Whoops.  I think they just didn't feel like paying her anymore.  Yeah, because no one cares about her.  Well, no one cares about local news as much as they used to with all our phones and all  that shit.  Local news is the worst fucking thing.  So they probably want to cut her drastically, and she probably said, you know what, maybe  this is a good time to step out.  I don't know.  Who was she talking to when she said that?  What had happened?  She's like, what the fuck are you doing? 
[00:42:00]  Who is she?  Probably someone walking through the set or something.  Yeah.  Fooling around with her papers or something.  I don't know.  Yapping in her ear while she's talking, maybe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I think both of those things are no big deal.  Yeah.  Ah, fuck it.  Who cares?  So she's leaving in another week?  Oh, yeah.  I was watching a local news last night, right before Seinfeld came on or something.  I had just switched.  And it's unwatchable. 
[00:42:30]  It's shit you heard or read at least that day.  But usually it's the day before.  And they play video clips of shit you saw already.  I guess they're catering to old people that don't have the internet in any way.  My phone, I have a jitterbug.  With the big buttons, I don't get the videos or whatever.  They wouldn't even know videos.  I can't get programs on my phone.  My programs.  I don't understand why they don't reinvent themselves.  But then again, look what happened with radio and satellite radio. 
[00:43:00]  This was supposed to reinvent the whole thing.  Yeah.  I don't know what happens when you get this great opportunity.  You're ahead of everybody and you fuck it up.  Like with local news, you got a few things.  When they tease a big sports game.  I'm just calling it a sports game.  But if you're into sports, you know if your team won or lost.  True.  So who are they teasing that for?  People that don't give a fuck about sports that much, right?  And you could just get the score instantly anywhere.  So why, if you're in charge of local news and the sports department, are you still allowing 
[00:43:30]  your guys to tease, you know, the score of a game?  Years ago it made sense.  Of course, because you had to wait.  There was nowhere to get the score.  You literally had to wait.  You're like, the game's over.  Right.  I don't know what the score was.  Right.  And they held you hostage.  They literally would hold you hostage and go, well, we're going to tell you who won that  game.  But guess what?  You're going to have to wait 20 fucking four minutes or whatever it was, right?  Now it's instant.  And then the other thing I don't understand is why they spent five to six minutes telling 
[00:44:00]  you the weather.  Yeah, that's another thing.  When all we do is hit a fucking app on our phones and you know exactly what the day brings.  You got the fucking weather.  They just, it's just, that's the way it's been, so that's the way it's got to be.  Why can't they reinvent that somehow?  What would the local news, what could they do to change because of the internet?  Like, I can't see what they could do.  But it's, they got to just go away.  No, just no more of the fucking teases.  Like, no more dumb teases.  No more of the little things they've done. 
[00:44:30]  What do they have to offer that you can't get on the internet?  More interviews.  People don't watch the internet a lot of times the way you watch the news.  Like, while you're eating dinner.  You don't look at your computer while you're living your life like you do with the TV on  in a lot of cases.  But you know it already.  Local shit.  Some cases you do.  You know the news.  Local shit.  Interviews.  Stuff like that.  Stuff that you're not necessarily going to look up.  Right.  You can do, again, that type of stuff you can still do on local news.  They just stop the cute shit and the teases and tell you what's coming up. 
[00:45:00]  Just give me the information, motherfucker, because I can look at it on my phone immediately.  They think that still works.  It stinks.  I doubt that still works.  Oh, I can't see it working.  We do teases here, but it's more of a, kind of a, I don't know.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  We pretty much have a captive audience anyway.  Yeah.  Just to kind of give you an idea of what we might talk about next, I guess.  Subscribers.  No one's going anywhere.  I know it's, I know it's not really holding people.  It's more, it's more of a service for the regulars to go, you know, next, yeah, we'll talk about  the Miami 911 calls or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't even know why we do it, I guess. 
[00:45:30]  People are, they're subscribed.  So it's like.  It's a habit.  What else do you say when you're signing off?  True.  Like, hey, we're going to go to break.  Commercial.  Like, you know, sometimes you go, all right, well, I guess coming back we'll talk about  whatever.  Yeah.  I don't believe it's holding people that much.  Ooh.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  Someone's getting a text now.  I have my phone texting on.  Are you sexting?  But I want to meet somebody who's coming in.  Oh. 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  It's a PM.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Who's coming in?  Hopefully not P.M.S.  Because.  Who's coming in?  I thought it was A.M.  Dougie Fresh, but it's 7 p.m.  I won't be available.  Oh.  Hey, did Roland explain to Penn Jillette that we just didn't have room for him yesterday?  I tried to explain to him in the bathroom, but we only had a couple minutes.  Kenny said 7 a.m.  Huh?  What?  More importantly, did Penn care?  Yeah, he kind of did.  He was bummed.  He's like, I really wanted to do your show.  And I go, Penn, I swear to you.  Yesterday was full.  We just had way too many guests. 
[00:46:30]  We didn't know where to put you yesterday.  We had three people in a row.  You can't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unless he came in, I guess, the crack of dawn or whatever you want to call it to start  of the show.  Does he have guests on his podcast or no?  Or does he just do it solo?  The ones I've heard, pretty much solo.  I saw it.  Yeah.  Or it's like guests, but not like big A-listers or B-listers.  He's got a co-host.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I'm doing a bunch of podcasts to promote my special.  I'm doing like Rogan, Jay Moore.  Oh.  Nice.  And Corolla.  And I want to do Penn if he has people.  Or Kevin Smith if they have people. 
[00:47:00]  I don't even know if they do.  Yeah.  I don't think Burr does.  I think Bill just does his.  Oh, it's a role.  Did he explain to Penn?  We like the Penn.  Yes, he understood.  He just wanted to do the show.  That's all.  Yeah.  I said, dude, we had no fucking room.  Yeah.  I told him we were jammed up.  And he's one of those guests, too.  You can't have a man with other people because he's, you know.  I bet you him and Paul Williams would have been.  They probably would have been like.  Those are guys that probably for some weird reason would have liked each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I told him we were talking to Paul Williams.  He's like, really? 
[00:47:30]  I want to meet him.  Where is he?  He was all excited.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some guests.  You stepped on him.  Yeah.  That was the issue.  Penn is a monster.  Yeah.  When you see him outside of the studio when he's not sitting down, he's a fucking monster.  Very tall.  Big.  Was he doing Howard or was he doing other shows?  I didn't even know he was in the building.  He's doing Alex Benet, Ron Nefez, and a few other shows.  Oh, all right.  So, he's got some time on our channel.  That's cool.  Oh, the shuttle's going.  Is the shuttle going down the Hudson now?  Well, they scraped the shuttle.  What?  You didn't see the paper? 
[00:48:00]  No, they scraped it.  This thing has gone back and forth.  What'd they do?  To space a million fucking times, and they scraped it.  They didn't figure out.  They were going through.  Where's the paper?  Well, actually, this one's the Enterprise.  It never went into space.  Oh.  What were they scraping off it?  Was it space barnacles or something?  Martians?  It was used for, in the atmosphere, testing of the glide.  I did not know that, sir.  Of the gliding.  Well, either way, they still scraped the fucking...  What was on it?  And some of the wing is now gone. 
[00:48:30]  What?  Oh, they...  I'm sorry.  It's in your paper.  By mistake.  I thought you meant they scraped it off like a ship from barnacles.  They fucking did that.  They thought they had enough room to go through one of these tight spots.  When did this happen?  Why wasn't I told?  In the water.  In the water.  And the fucking thing got scraped.  Oh, man.  So now you gotta fix it.  That's bullshit.  That is bullshit.  They hit a bridge?  Yeah, like...  What did they hit?  The Verrazano?  Oh, I don't know.  No, no.  I don't know if that's where they hit.  I just saw the paper.  It's in the paper.  It's a couple of pages in it.  I was watching Apollo 13 again. 
[00:49:00]  I can never not watch that movie.  That's a great movie.  That is a great fucking movie, man.  It really is.  I didn't realize how good that was in 95, because it was right after Gump in Philadelphia,  so you were a little Tom Hanks-ed out at that point.  Yeah.  Like you're like a riot already, possibly third Oscar.  Another great Bill Paxton movie, too.  This piece of shit's gonna get you home!  Oh, God, I forgot that.  I was watching it.  Over the top Bill Paxton.  That was him in the...  Yeah.  And Kevin Bacon.  Yeah.  He's a really good actor.  This piece of shit's gonna get you home. 
[00:49:30]  You think he plays the same guy every time?  Every single role he's in.  Hatfield!  Right, we get it.  What was the reading?  Well, let's put her in charge!  True lies.  It's already here!  What happened with Hatfield and McCoy's there?  Hatfield's and McCoy's.  It was a three-part miniseries.  Was it good?  It was good.  I liked it.  Yeah, I liked it.  You made it to the end?  Yeah.  Yeah, it did.  It was pretty goddamn good.  Did they solve their differences by the end of it? 
[00:50:00]  It just...  That feud just kind of petered out.  People got tired of kind of killing each other, and it just kind of went away, really.  Did it end with a nice picnic or something?  No, no.  It ended pretty badly, too.  Oh, really?  And then, like, Bill Paxton's character, a couple of years later, he winds up in his little  shitty house, and he's got a wood-burning stove or something going, and he accidentally  catches himself on fire and burns to death.  Oh, my God.  That was pretty funny. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, I'm burning to death.  Ow!  Someone get some water!  That's funny.  Love the Bill Paxton.  Yeah.  He's great.  Hey, Roland, how did we get Ralph Macchio?  You were at the Jets game when I met him.  What happened?  He said he would never do our show.  He said it very politely, though.  Well, he said he had nothing going on at that time, and he was like, what will I be doing  there now?  Well, he was so scared of our edginess, too. 
[00:51:00]  Edginess.  I'm happy he's coming on.  Yeah, he turned around.  I had no problem with Ralph Macchio.  Well, I have a big issue with him.  He's a Long Island guy.  He's kind of a Huntington guy, sort of.  Where in Long Island was it around?  Kind of the Huntington area.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll go local with him.  We'll go old school.  Local.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take a break.  You're the best around.  No, we forgot yesterday, and here we go with the T's.  But I think it's more of an excitement thing.  We got the 911 calls from the Miami face-eating attack. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, from face-eating guy.  Yeah.  And I have something to talk about with my ex.  Next.  What?  Coming up.  Oh.  The Open Anthony Killing.  Sirius XM.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.

[00:54:30]  Oh, Mimi Beersley  Sirius XM  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show  My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever 
[00:55:00]  We'll begin bombing in five minutes  Oh, that Reagan was a hoot  He was kidding, right?  No, he actually bombed Russia and the world ended  Why did he say that?  He was fucking around  He was testing the mic  Yeah  It was a hot mic, he didn't know it, he just thought he was testing  And, yeah, he was making some fun and lofts  Who's the asshole that decided to give it to the press, though?  Yeah 
[00:55:30]  Back then, it was a little harder to get shit out there  Yeah  I guess Reagan died eight years ago  Wow  Yes  He would have been 101  Oh, boy  He made it to 93, though  He never would have made it  Wait a minute, that's eight years ago?  Yeah  When they, when Nancy Reagan had, like, uh  What?  The army guy  Oh, holding her by the, uh, by the coffin  Remember?  Yeah  She had that escort the whole time  Yeah  That's eight years ago? 
[00:56:00]  Yep  I don't remember  Oh, fuck  Why'd she have the escort?  Was she too weak or just  Oh, that was just, you know, a military guy  Yeah, you know, he's gotta get her arm  Big fucking tough military guy was gonna help her get through it  How old is she?  Fallen  She's gotta be well into her 90s as well  Yeah  She just met the Romneys recently  The Romneys came by to get her endorsement  She's always teetering over  Who gives a fuck who Nancy Reagan likes?  I know  Who gives a fuck?  This whole endorsement thing has gotten weird  Stinks  I think it, I think it  Oh, there's Penn  Penn's on CNN right now 
[00:56:30]  Oh  Cause I said, come  I go, Howard, come by today  He goes, ah, busy tomorrow  Yeah  So, there you go  That's TV  Yeah, it's a wash  We want him, uh, today  On the TV  He was able to do yesterday  Yeah  Now, the endorsement thing  How did that get out of hand?  I don't know  It just seems like, uh, it used to be  Like, newspapers would endorse  And that was kind of a big thing  Because newspapers had credibility  Right  Uh  Past presidents are  Yeah, yeah  Are important, I'm sure  Now it's like 
[00:57:00]  Even though they're gonna do the party thing  Now it's like, who gives a shit  Who Sarah Jessica Parker, uh, endorses  With her stupid party  Ugh  Oh, that commercial drove you nuts  Oh, did that drive me fucking  Fucking crazy  Which one did you see?  There's a couple  There's a couple different ones  Yeah  There's  Sarah Jessica Parker's is not bad  No, it's bad  The dinner one?  Yeah, yeah  Oh, you saw a couple other ones?  It drove Anthony nuts  I saw a worse one  Really?  Yeah  I just don't like her bullshit  So, where do we find these?  Um, just go online 
[00:57:30]  Look up her  And then Anna Winter  Oh, yeah  From the editor of Vogue  Oh, Hannah  Oh, that's different  But the endorsement thing  Getting back to that for a second  Then your favorite band  You gotta wait for them  Yeah  Really?  Who are they gonna endorse?  Really?  Really?  And it gets down to Nancy Reagan  Well into her 90s  What the fuck  What she  Finally endorsed the Romneys  Oh, good  And I guess that's important  Because the Reagan name  Because she fucked a guy  Who helped the country 
[00:58:00]  Right  Of course she was gonna endorse  The Republican candidate  Of course  Yes, hello  But the Anna Winter one  Was more annoying  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan  What's going on with this?  Obama's coming to town  To do some dinners or something?  Obama is coming to town  Because you can win a dinner  He'll text you when you're sleeping  He'll fuck you when you're awake  He knows if you've been better  So be good for goodness sake  No, that's the actual song 
[00:58:30]  What you're doing there?  It's all, don't butcher it.  The Sarah Jessica Parker one brags that he created 4 million new jobs.  Yeah, yeah.  And that drove Anthony nuts yesterday morning.  We never got to it yesterday.  Could you just not fucking talk about the job situation?  Jobs are horrendous.  She wouldn't lie.  He created 4 million new jobs.  Oh, he probably did and then lost fucking 10 million.  Well, maybe that's how it works.  It's such a load of shit.  Didn't mention that part. 
[00:59:00]  No, where is he at with jobs?  About even?  About even?  A little lower?  A little higher?  Where are we at?  No, job situation is terrible.  Where are we at?  The last numbers, only around 60,000 new jobs.  All right.  That's good.  And they were expecting a lot more.  I think 8.2% unemployment.  It's just a wreck.  That's the real key.  But wasn't the unemployment a little higher a few months ago? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, it got up into the nines.  And then it went from 8.1 to 8.2?  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah.  Something like that?  It's just lingering in a bad place for much too long is what's happening.  And we don't really see the president doing anything huge for jobs.  He's doing other, I don't know what, he's campaigning his ass off is what he's doing.  And how about some jobs?  How about you work? 
[01:00:00]  What kind of jobs?  Well, one thing that would really be good, and I know it's not the end-all, do-all for jobs,  but how about you fucking go ahead for the Keystone Pipeline from Canada?  That's too scary.  And, you know...  That was too scary.  A few jobs in there.  How about you pull some restrictions on some of the refineries?  Get some jobs in there.  And at the same time, you're being a little more self-sufficient with some Earl and whatnot.  But, you know, I'm an asshole.  What do I know?  Whenever Anthony talks politics, he sounds like an asshole. 
[01:00:30]  I'm with Anthony 100%.  He rules.  Anthony's the biggest asshole I've ever heard.  He should keep his mouth shut and just do jokes.  Anthony should run for president.  And he's a genius, politically.  That's what I read every fucking day.  That's why the whole thing's ridiculous.  Yes.  One guy could hate your guts, and the next guy fucking thinks you're God's gift.  It's exactly that, yes.  I imagine I'm somewhere in the middle.  So, there you go.  Yeah.  So, relax, everybody.  Exactly.  I know people fucking hate me, and I know people love me. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  That's what happens.  Right.  It's just trying to make a balance.  I don't know what to tell you.  It's just trying to balance it out.  I don't know what to tell you.  Right.  I only get positive feedback.  Do you?  Well, that's good, Jimmy.  Jimmy's the only one in the world.  The negative feedback I get is, Jim, you're as good as it gets.  I wish there was more of you.  Oh, see, that's very negative.  How do I hear more Jim Norton?  That's what I get.  That's negative.  No.  Mimi Beardsley.  That's good.  I'm so happy.  I like that one.  I don't mind that being stuck in my head. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  The live version.  We can't find the Sarah Jessica Barker commercial?  Look up Anna Wintour.  W-I-N-T-O-U-R.  She's the editor of Vogue, and The Devil Wears Prada was based on her.  Apparently, she's a real cunt.  I've never met her.  Oh, really?  And she looks like Harry Dean Stanton.  I would like to fuck her, though.  You think she takes pride in the fact that people think she's a cunt?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  She maybe thinks it's completely uncalled for.  Maybe she does like it.  I have no idea.  You know, out of all the words out there, I just don't like saying cunt. 
[01:02:00]  Why?  I don't know.  It's a great word.  I really don't like saying it for whatever reason.  I love saying it.  I love shouting it.  I love insinuating it.  I love texting it.  I'll change it up a little bit so it's softer or something.  I don't know what it is with that word.  That's a good one.  That's one I just don't like saying.  Oh, it's wonderful.  I think people should be allowed to say it.  Yeah.  I'm not one of those guys.  It fits.  I try not to overuse it.  But from my personal, I don't know.  You don't like it in your arsenal?  Not really.  Oh, I love it.  I'll say it for you.  She's a cunt. 
[01:02:30]  That's what I hear.  All right.  Here's the commercial with her.  Oh, which one is this?  Don't be late.  All right.  It's what's happening.  They're doing Sarah Jessica Parker.  It's the same thing as having a dinner thing with Anna Wintour and Michelle and Barack.  Why would you want to have dinner with her?  I don't mind Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm guessing that she puts so much money into it.  But I'm guessing Anna Wintour bought her way in or did something in Vogue, you know.  Right.  And they show this during the MTV Awards.  No one at the MTV Awards gives a fuck about Sarah Jessica Parker or especially this bitch. 
[01:03:00]  You know what?  MTV Movie Awards ratings down 29% from last year.  Yeah, big competition this year.  What was it?  Game of Thrones.  Oh, the Game of Thrones.  Killed them.  Game of Thrones.  I watched that.  But it was also a bad show, man.  Yeah.  And it sucked, yeah.  Russell Brand sucked.  But I watched Game of Thrones.  I liked this annoying...  There was something sexy about her, believe it or not.  Like, I'm guessing she's a submissive sexually because she's such a dominating fucking lady.  I'd love to give her a good dicking.  You think you can slide one in her shithole? 
[01:03:30]  See, I don't mind saying stuff like that.  No.  But say cunt.  That's bad.  But I'll bet you that she's a sub.  You think?  That's my opinion, yes.  All three holes?  She's kind of an Ann Romano hairdo.  Yeah, I don't know about her.  She's not ugly for a man-woman.  That's the new look the broads are doing.  Yeah.  It's the bangs, but they're the low-hanging bangs.  And then they got a bob going.  Bob cut.  Yeah.  Where the bangs almost tickle their eyeballs.  Yeah.  The bangs are actually lower than their eyebrows. 
[01:04:00]  Was the devil where Prada...  Was it a fun movie?  Like, did it seem like she's a completely twat or...  Of course, because it's Hollywood.  It has to turn around by the end a little bit.  And, you know...  I've never seen it.  And the devil there becomes a little softer.  Or...  Yeah.  Let's see this.  I don't remember how good that movie was.  I did see it.  I do remember.  I didn't fucking outright hate it, but...  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, let's watch this.  Yeah.  This commercial stinks. 
[01:04:30]  Hi, I'm Anna Wintour, and I'm so lucky in my work that I'm able to meet some of the  most incredible women in the world.  Yeah.  Women like Sarah Jessica Parker and Michelle Obama.  These two wonderful women and I are hosting a dinner along with the president in New York  City to benefit the Obama campaign on June the 14th.  It'll be a fantastic evening, and you can join us.  We're saving the two best seats in the house for you, but you have to enter to win.  You can enter right now by going to barackobama.com slash NewYorkNight.  Sarah Jessica and I both have our own reasons for supporting President Obama, and we want 
[01:05:00]  to hear yours.  So please join us, but just don't be late.  I hate the two different camera angles they were cutting between, which you can't see when  you're listening to it.  Well, that means she fucked up the copy.  But there is something sexy about her.  I'll be honest.  She's not a fucking unfuckable woman.  She's 70 years old.  Fuck that.  How old is she?  I guess she's been around for a while.  How old is she, Dan?  Can we, you put Anna Wintour in quotes. 
[01:05:30]  Look, I don't mind an older broad, but how do you say she's sexy?  There's something sexy about her.  Let me see.  I'd let her suck my dick.  I heard she was hot back in what they call the day.  Yeah.  Was she?  And I like her because she's really ritzy and proper.  I wouldn't mind paddling her bottom.  I wanted Barack Obama and Michelle Obama.  Dude, she would step on your head.  No, she wouldn't.  Barack.  She would have her pussy eating well.  Yeah.  She would have her fucking pussy eating like a champ. 
[01:06:00]  Let's call her and ask her.  I'm going to come now.  No, you're not.  I'd slap the lips a little.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah, but I hear.  Let me see that.  That's not her.  Oh.  I don't know what that is.  What was Sarah Jessica Parker's, though?  Yeah, you got that one.  We got that one.  She was pulling a carriage through Central Park.  Yes.  She said, she's getting ready for Belmont.  Exactly.  Is that her boyfriend?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  She's probably her son. 
[01:06:30]  Your son.  Where's the Sarah Jessica one?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Married man, are you?  That's a good one.  That's the one where she lies.  Lying sack of shite.  Well, she's done the best she can.  She's probably technically right, but misleading.  I kind of think she looks sexy in her commercial.  She doesn't look bad at all. 
[01:07:00]  Who, Sarah Jessica Parker?  Yes, she looks good, actually.  She doesn't look bad.  Oh, God.  She doesn't look bad.  Oh, we need volume.  The guy who says you should be able to marry anyone you want,  and the guy who created four million new jobs.  Ah, shut up.  Obama and Michelle are coming to my house for dinner on June 14th,  and I want you to be there, too.  But you have to go to joinobama.com for your chance to win,  and the contest ends tomorrow night.  So go right here, right now, because we need him, and he needs us.  I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message. 
[01:07:30]  You know, I've got to ask you, if you're the winner and you go to one of those dinners, do you eat?  Do these people actually eat with the president in the room?  No fucking way.  Are you just nibbling a little bit?  No, it's like the VIP section and then the VVIP section that we went to the Springsteen thing.  Oh, right.  And so that's probably what that is.  You probably sit at the kid table.  Right.  They have the big adults table where the president is, and then you sit at the little kid's table.  No, you're probably at the table with them.  You think?  Absolutely.  You're probably sitting there.  Really?  There's probably a table for like eight people or whatever. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  And it's probably him and Michelle, Anna Winter, her fucking guy, whoever she's with, Sarah Jessica Park, whoever she's with.  There's probably 10 or 12 people out there, but you're probably at the table with them.  How many people?  We don't even know.  You're probably taking a group photo, and I'm guessing.  Could you pass the ketchup?  Yeah.  As the president, could you pass the salt or something?  Could you need some salt?  Yeah.  Would you just pig out?  Yeah.  I would eat everything.  I would just fucking eat the whole time.  I'd be fucking stuck playing footsie with Michelle Obama on her giant foot.  I'd be nervously eating, picking on people's plates. 
[01:08:30]  Are you hungry?  I'm still hungry.  Can I have any more?  Get any pretzels with mustard.  I'm still hungry.  It's like handsy.  I would be clearing out my food pocket the entire time.  Ah, Christ on a pony.  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  It sounds stupid.  It sounds stupid.  All right.  Woo!  Yeah.  So you think you really get to sit there, though? 
[01:09:00]  I don't.  I bet not.  You think there's like a kid table for the winner?  Yeah.  I bet the fucking Secret Service don't want you that close.  Yeah.  I don't think you get to sit there.  I don't know.  Absolutely.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know if you do.  Yep.  Yeah.  With fucking Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm sure you don't get a fucking place where you can actually talk with them.  Yes.  How great would it be if...  You're probably way down the end of the table with some mother's thumb.  No, the president.  You probably offer some...  With the press.  No, it's a...  Again, it's a fucking...  No.  It's a contest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You might be in the same room, but you're not that close to the president. 
[01:09:30]  You get to meet them.  I'm telling you for a big...  I'm sure you get a meet and greet and a picture, but I bet you're not sitting right up there  where you could have a conversation with him and Sarah Jessica Parker.  There's probably...  How many fucking people are there?  There's probably a giant table.  Yeah.  There's probably a bunch of tables.  I don't think it's even in our house, is it?  Yes.  It's probably literally dinner at a table in her house.  How many people?  Why aren't they telling us this stuff?  I'm just sitting there just talking politics with them, you know, and then drinking too  much, getting a little too loud.  You fucking people!  You don't understand guys like me, motherfucker. 
[01:10:00]  You know, I'm the working man.  You say you're fucking four, but I fucking...  Ah, fuck it.  I don't even know what I'm saying.  What?  What?  What?  Well, I ain't sweating to kill him.  I'm just talking to him.  Oh, God.  He'd wrestle to the ground.  All drunk and belligerent.  Oh, just nasty.  And the president has to deal with it.  The president's like trying to talk and he's got to keep stopping and looking at you.  Can we do something about this guy? 
[01:10:30]  I would love to cut a gasser really loud.  Oh, man.  Oh, you would have to go in there gassy, right?  I want to thank Sarah Jessica Parker for having the...  Just cut a big, loud, nasty, stinky...  Or no, a hot one.  Just to watch no one acknowledges him.  I think you blame it on him.  Kind of pointing.  That guy.  Or how are you blaming it on Sarah Jessica?  Come on, who's far...  It smells like oats.  We don't know who it was.  Yeah, I bet you do get to because... 
[01:11:00]  I don't know.  I want details on this thing.  It's a small event.  It's a dumb event.  I could be wrong, but I bet you that you do.  It's a publicity stunt.  Well, yeah, it's just dumb.  By joining, why do they want all these people?  It's probably a way to get people for an email blast.  Of course.  Because you have to join.  Of course.  Definitely.  So they can get the word out.  Yeah.  Well, good for the lucky winner.  I want to win.  Because I sit there with that lib fucking twat and the wonderful president.  I want to win. 
[01:11:30]  He's just got to listen to questions about the presidency.  What's it like?  And you know Obama just wants to talk about anything but.  I bet he's there for an hour.  How many bathrooms are in the White House?  An hour tops.  I bet you he comes in.  45 minutes.  Maybe.  Maybe he comes right in for the meal.  Everyone's probably seated when he comes in.  You're all ready for dinner.  He comes in.  He sits.  You talk for a few minutes.  You're introduced to him, of course.  Oh, thank you.  Blah, blah, blah.  You have your dinner.  At the end, there's probably a big group picture.  And you might be able to finagle a picture with him. 
[01:12:00]  If you just.  You'd have to blur it out.  Go, can I just take a picture with you alone?  Then he'd be on the spot.  He'd say yes.  And I would do that.  I'd fucking step over her hoof to get to him.  Another horse joke.  I don't think it's close to a real dinner.  Maybe it's a light dinner.  I bet it's not.  I bet you.  You're right.  I don't think so at all.  Does anybody know anything or speculate?  Because these things have been done before.  No, I don't know.  I have the greatest charity idea ever.  What's that?  I told you on the air once.  I'll tell you off the air now.  But we're going to make it happen.  Feels for meals? 
[01:12:30]  That's a good one.  That's a great one.  That one.  Supposedly, we could do it.  I could raise.  They said we could do it.  $100 million in a night.  What?  That's impossible.  No, it's not.  For us?  No.  Why can't it be for us?  It just wouldn't work that way.  Well, how do you know?  Well, I have my ideas and I'm working towards it.  $100 million in one night?  Yep.  Now, no one's ever done that, I don't think.  I don't think so.  I've already touched on this, but I could do it. 
[01:13:00]  What is it again?  Turn off the mic and I'll say it.  Play us the music.  I don't have music.  Here you do.  I don't.  It's a great idea.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, there you go.  Thank you. 
[01:13:30]  I'm stealing that. 
[01:14:00]  I'm tweeting Jimmy's idea right now at OP Radio.  Do you think it's a good idea?  I'm not sure.  I'm telling you.  I think it's a great idea.  I really do.  It's an absolutely doable thing.  For whatever reason, people wouldn't agree to that.  I don't know.  I think you're wrong.  I think I just need someone who can make it happen. 
[01:14:30]  What?  You're going to be in charge of making this happen?  No, but I would just be there.  Would you get a piece of the action?  Financially, no.  You should.  Piece of the action.  I wouldn't want it.  You should, though.  You'd want it.  If you're raising $100 million in one night, you want your taste.  No money.  It's a charity.  I would take my taste.  Would you take your taste in?  I would so take a taste.  You've got to take a taste.  I already know what I would want.  All these big charities take a taste.  Nope.  You would want one of those.  That's it.  Oh, get out of here. 
[01:15:00]  That's all I'd want.  Money's way better than that.  I'd like a nice cup of coffee for charity, and I don't take any money from charity.  You've got to take a taste.  Nope.  As the chairman of the charity, you'd take a taste.  Nice cup of coffee.  I'd like a nice cup of coffee.  Just got to talk about your finder's fee.  I like that idea.  I do remember that idea.  I'm working towards making it happen.  Well.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  How?  You need to be in certain circles that I don't think you're in.  You're not in those circles.  I'm not.  But somebody. 
[01:15:30]  One background check, and guess what?  Well, I'm not in the circles, but they're not as impossible to get into as you think.  Like, somebody I know happens to be very good friends with the wife of someone who is now dead, but is extraordinarily influential.  And there's different charities and different groups.  And da-da-da, and ba-ba-ba, and ba-ba-ba, and ba-ba-ba, and da-da-da-da-da-da.  And a fur-fur-fur.  I guess you told this idea because people know it. 
[01:16:00]  I know they do.  But now you don't want to say it again.  Nah, because everybody doesn't know it, and I don't want to jinx it.  But no, some people know it.  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying, we know already.  Some do.  Yeah.  Wait till it happens.  Then we'll see.  Well, if it's going to happen, you've got to take your taste.  If you're the guy that raised $100 million in one night, no one's going to mind that you took a little taste.  What's wrong with you?  You don't take a taste from $100 million in charity.  Ever.  If you took 2%, that's great.  A lot of these charities don't pay that well. 
[01:16:30]  You don't take any.  A lot of these charities are horrendous.  First of all, to get it done, I would have to be taking nothing.  It's a big thing.  And there's no one.  There can be no shady dealings.  That's true.  To get it done, you've got to be really charitable.  No shady dealings.  100% charity.  You take 2%.  That's good.  That means 90% of the money went to the actual charity.  That's huge.  That never happens.  That's 98.  I said 98.  Oh, you said 90.  I meant 98.  Oh, yeah.  I really did.  I didn't say 98.  No, you said 90.  Unless you said 98 and it's 90. 
[01:17:00]  No, no, no, dude.  You've got to give it all.  You can't take any.  I wouldn't want the money.  Well, you could talk charities for a minute here.  I'm telling you, these charities don't give 98% of the money.  They might, but to pull off this?  Some do.  Would have to.  How much would you take?  I would take 10%.  No, I would take nothing.  I would take 10 million.  I'd take 100% if I'm going to talk about what I'm taking, but I couldn't take anything.  No.  They wouldn't do it.  An idea like that, you would look like a hero and you would have a fat bank account.  They wouldn't say.  They'd be like, what's in it for you?  Well, I'm going to take. 
[01:17:30]  Goodbye.  Nah.  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Fine print.  Nah.  Oh, try to bamboozle them?  Yes.  That's what I would do.  And the charter.  Whatever.  And the charter.  And the charter will be fine print.  I'd take 2%.  Hey, is that story true?  Yes.  There, Danny.  What?  What's that?  Casey Anthony got all fat because she just sits around eating bad fast food and on her  computer all the time.  Unfortunately, this just says that that's what the report is.  And it's like from the mail UK online, and that's usually a bunch of bullshit. 
[01:18:00]  I didn't see any fat pics yet, but hopefully they do pop up.  I would like to see what fat Casey looks like.  Where is she living?  Yeah, where is she?  I think she's still in Florida.  Florida, yeah.  She's got like some other court case in December, I think.  For what?  Forced to appear in court in New York.  I think she's being sued by the woman, Zanny the nanny.  Yeah, Zanelda Gonzalez is suing her.  For what?  Because, I guess she said she was the babysitter. 
[01:18:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  I thought Zanny the nanny was Zanax.  Yes.  I think it was, but I don't even know.  She made up so many fucking lies.  She was such a lying sack of shite.  She's a fucking cunt.  I really, I hope she's killed in an auto accident.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow, really?  I hope her fucking tits are ripped off in a car accident.  Oh, no.  Oh, those ample breasts.  Scraped on the ground.  I hope they're scraped off on the ground in a car accident. 
[01:19:00]  Wow.  She, yeah.  That's bad karma.  She's there.  No, it's great karma.  And the Zim is back in jail.  Oh, yeah.  Dummy, he lied.  They lied about how much money they had.  Yeah.  They said that they didn't have that much money.  And apparently he had a website set up that was giving money to him for his legal costs.  And they failed to tell the judge about that.  Oops.  When the judge set the bail, I never knew that was ever taken into consideration, how much 
[01:19:30]  money you actually have for bail when they set the bail.  Because that's supposed to be like, hey, here's the fucking bail based on your crime or what  you do or whatever.  And you either come up with it or you don't.  I didn't think they said, well, how much do you have kind of a thing.  But they think he was being, he was deceiving the court.  So they threw him back in jail.  And I guess there's another bail hearing next week because this week the judge has other 
[01:20:00]  things to do.  Oh, really?  So you just got to sit there and rot in jail while the judge is out doing other things.  But he'll be back.  And I guess they're going to try to have another hearing.  The prosecution is going to try to keep him in jail because I guess they realize they got  to punish him now because with the evidence they have against the defense evidence, he's  probably going to walk.  He'll probably get out.  Yeah.  Well, he might.  They'll keep him in jail a week or two and then they'll get him out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  Who cares about that case anymore?  They will when it starts up again.  You think?  Yeah.  They've moved on to other things now, though.  What's the big case right now?  No big case.  What's the big case?  No big case.  No big case.  Sandusky's going into court soon.  Sandusky, right.  That will be back in very shortly.  Jury selection, I think, starts today in the Sandusky case.  I love your material on Sandusky, by the way, Jimmy.  Yes, I was happy.  And everyone's going to see that on Epix very soon.  June 30th.  A couple more weeks.  Three weeks or so.  Yeah.  Really good take on it. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, man.  There was something.  There is no big case right now.  Shit.  Octomom.  Oh, Octomom.  Oh, God.  Octomom.  I love him.  She's now part-time stripping.  Stripping.  In Florida.  What the fuck?  I'd see that.  Would you?  Yeah, you've got to see that.  Would you do a lap dance from Octomomom?  Yeah.  No.  I would.  That big fucking 14-kid veg.  I would do that.  14 kids?  How many?  Eight?  I think 18. 
[01:21:30]  Octo?  18.  18?  18 Octo?  Yeah.  18 kids.  I want to eat Danny.  Danny left the studio for a second.  I want to eat his sandwich so bad while he's gone.  Oh, you should take a big bite out of it.  It's a giant bite.  I would just cut around the bite.  That would look great.  Most people would.  No.  Oh, he would be so bummed.  He's not coming.  That's hilarious.  I'd love to take a big bite out of his sandwich. 
[01:22:00]  I just don't know what kind of sandwich.  Did you see the comedian at George Clooney's house, a live tweet in the dinner, and the  news picked up on it?  Really?  So what?  Obama did one of these with Clooney, I guess.  Oh, no.  So why are they doing this?  Oh, that's the one they told...  Oh, right, right, right.  The comedian?  Who was there?  Yeah, what comedian?  God damn it.  Now we've got to talk to this guy.  Steve in Times Square.  Yes, Steve.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Sorry.  What comedian was it?  It was Ben Hoffman.  I don't know who he is. 
[01:22:30]  He won?  He was at home just sitting on his couch, and he started tweeting about this dinner,  and the press started picking up on it and actually saying what the guy was saying  on Twitter.  Oh, he was making believe he was there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's kind of clever.  That's a good one.  That's clever.  The press is great.  I like that.  He can find it on Facebook, a whole list of tweets.  Right.  And then the stupid media started going with it, thinking it was real.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's actually hilarious, some of the stuff he wrote. 
[01:23:00]  Cool, man.  Jesus.  Cool, guys.  Thanks.  All right.  Cool, guys.  Is it time to change?  Yeah.  Great.  Octomom stripping part-time.  Yeah.  Part-time strippers.  I guess not bottomless.  What?  Not bottomless.  You've got to look at the baby maker.  No, I guess not.  Nope.  Just topless.  But do you want to see that baby maker?  Yes.  I want to see her purse.  It's going to look like fucking Omaha Beach.  I'm sideshow all the way, man. 
[01:23:30]  I'm all about the sideshow.  Yes, you can.  You wouldn't look.  No.  Why?  I would want to see it.  Of course.  But I guess what you're trying to say is you don't want to see it for a turn-on thing.  Of course not.  I'd see it in a medical environment, like in a fucking circus sideshow.  No, that makes it weirder that she's in that environment, showing where all the kids came from.  It's supposed to be hot.  Well, you know it's not going to be hot. 
[01:24:00]  No.  And what about, because she's going to dance topless.  What's that going to look like?  Did she breastfeed all those things?  She's got topless pictures out there already, right?  Jesus.  Are she holding them up?  I don't know if she's going to have to do the boob hug, the arm bra.  Right.  Arm bra, right?  Yeah.  They call that arm bra?  She also does it just right to the solo porno.  Yeah, I know.  The masturbation video.  Anyone see that?  We must have pictures of it.  Is it out yet, or has it just been shot? 
[01:24:30]  Her masturbating?  It's terrible.  With what?  One of the kids?  What is she?  Fucking, what the fuck is her deal?  She needs money, and she's fucking psychotic.  Maybe not psychotic.  Wasn't she having a show?  What happened to her?  She had a show.  She sucks.  No, no, but what was her thing?  She had a show, and I don't know.  Did she have a show, even?  I don't know.  Even.  I don't know what she was.  Like, why is she famous at all?  Unless, is that her right there?  Yeah.  Some pictures, she almost looks good. 
[01:25:00]  I said almost.  I said almost.  What are they doing with that belly?  I said almost.  There's got to be a world of hurt there.  Dude, she's screwed.  Just a world of hurt.  When they take a picture from, like, just the right angle, she almost looks.  All right, look.  Yeah.  All right.  No.  Yeah.  There you go, Ant.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, those things.  God.  Those things would fall.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Those boobs are falling.  She's holding them up.  Yeah, because they would probably get close to the belly button.  I'd still suck them, though.  She doesn't look that bad.  Suck them.  She almost looks all right.  No.  Almost.  Eh.  In some pictures.  Wow.  That's bad.  And then there's others that, yeah, absolutely not.  Octomom.  What a great name to have.  Was that a Nancy Grace thing?  Or one of those.  Was it?  Probably.  It sounds like something Nancy Grace would say.  Who's the other broad mom?  That we don't like.  Tot mom. 
[01:26:00]  Who's the other one?  Besides Nancy Grace?  Yeah, there's two of them.  You got Nancy Grace.  Who's the other one?  What?  From CNN?  What's her name?  Greta Van Susteren?  Greta.  Greta Van Susteren.  You got Greta and Nancy Grace.  Yeah, Nancy Grace is umpteen thousand times more despicable than Nancy Grace.  I mean, than Nancy Grace.  Than herself.  Than Greta Van Susteren.  They're both pretty bad, no?  Yeah, but Nancy Grace is the worst.  She is the most horrible fucking thing on television. 
[01:26:30]  And the production value of her show is really bad, too.  It's cheesy.  It's cheap.  But she can't seem to, um, she's always trying to make a catchphrase and a clever name for  the people that she's reporting on.  That's more important than the actual story.  And then it's like, instead of looking at the facts of things, she just goes in with  pure emotion.  The Casey Anthony thing is a perfect example of that.  So many people were, too.  Like, oh, I can't wait till she hangs.  Oh, I can't wait till this. 
[01:27:00]  I can't wait.  And then anyone that was watching that knew she was going to get off the hook.  Right.  That the prosecution just did not fucking have it.  That's how I feel about this Zimmerman thing, also, from what I've seen so far.  And after, you know, hopefully they'll show the trial.  I'd love to watch that and see what they get.  But just based on what they're showing now and what's come out, boy.  I don't think you're wrong at all.  Looks like the Zim is going to walk on second-degree murder.  I think you're right.  No fucking way.  I think you're right. 
[01:27:30]  By the way, getting back to the dinner with Obama.  Oh.  Bri Pat.  Dinner with schmucks.  Bri Pat 17.  Win the dinner and then go and just quote Ferris Bueller all night to Matthew Broderick.  Completely ignoring him.  Oh, that'd be a good one.  They're split, aren't they?  Oh.  Are they?  Oh, let me just say.  I think it's Splitsville for those two.  Oh, a little gossip section.  It's like Variety magazine.  You sure?  I had heard that a while ago.  Am I the only one, Danny?  Is that true?  I don't know.  Dan, please get the Matthew Broderick update. 
[01:28:00]  Never really cared about Matthew Broderick.  Oh, I like him.  Met him once, though, thanks to Rob Bartlett.  I had a lovely dinner with him.  He's a true gentleman.  You had dinner with Matthew Broderick.  Thanks to Louie.  When Louie brought me to that cast party to meet Alan Alda,  he was going to dinner with Chris Rock first,  and he invited me.  He said, do you want to go with me and Chris?  I'm like, all right, it's cool.  It's the first time at Nobu.  And then Matthew Broderick joined us.  So at one table was you, Louie C.K., Chris Rock,  and Matthew Broderick?  That was it, yeah.  And you quoted Ferris Bueller lines?  No, but he was a tough crowd fan, so we chatted. 
[01:28:30]  Oh.  Were you a little nervous?  That's a big table right there.  No, because I know Louie really well,  and Chris, I know.  I know you're a star as well, but that's a big table.  No, this is about fucking five years ago.  Whenever Louie did the, four years ago,  whenever Louie did the Alan Alda movie.  Did he come off as effeminate?  Broderick?  Yeah.  No.  No?  Yes.  I saw him recently here.  He's very nice.  Really?  Why did you see him here?  The motherfucker was too impressed.  I'll be surprised high talk guy.  Really?  When did that?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit effeminate.  A little bit. 
[01:29:00]  You know how on Google it has the autocomplete?  Yeah.  Well, here's the most popular things  when you type in Matthew Broderick.  It's Matthew Broderick Broadway,  Matthew Broderick Movies,  Matthew Broderick Affair,  and then Matthew Broderick Gay.  Oh, wow.  Google.  Coming in fourth place.  Gay goal.  Rocketing up the charts, though.  Right.  Wow.  Coming in.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  He comes off a little femmy.  A little bit.  I hate his Super Bowl commercial. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, the Ferris Bueller day offline.  Matt trying to reenact the fucking Ferris Bueller thing.  It's very...  It just...  It hurts.  Oh.  What scene was this from?  This is where Ferris does the monologue.  From the commercial, too.  Why wouldn't he play...  Yeah, I don't know this.  Boo, boop, boop.  Why would you play that one?  If we're talking about Ferris Bueller's Day Off... 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, this is it.  Oh, yeah.  What is this?  Oh, yeah.  This was a song in the 80s that was in every movie.  Was this yellow?  It's called Day Babau.  But the band's yellow.  I don't know what their bravery level is.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ow.  This is...  This was used in a couple movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was in The Shining.  He's chasing over the axe.  That would roll. 
[01:30:30]  That's the sound when you see the bunny rabbit blowing the dog or whatever.  That would be great.  Oh, yeah.  Of the Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  What a dumb song, but I like it.  Yeah.  A lot of dumb songs in the 80s.  It's just a dumb song.  That were just so catchy.  Like, you had to put this out there.  We all know it now.  Yeah.  So, you know, you know what I mean, though?  Hearing this for the first time, you would have to think, what the fuck were you thinking? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was the theme music to the Eton Pat's documentary.  Jesus.  My God, man.  Eton, stay off.  And you can't even say too soon, because that was like 20 years ago.  I know, right?  30.  Yeah.  Give us another wacky song from the 80s, E-Rock.  Let's challenge your knowledge of wacky songs that were in movies.  I don't know if I'm going to have...  I can't come up with another one, can you? 
[01:31:30]  Another wacky song?  Yeah, I think so.  On this level?  I'm pretty sure it's the 80s.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of movie 80s.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And what about...  That's a wacky song.  I mean, it's not wacky, but Axl F. theme from Beverly Hills Cop.  Yes.  Yep.  Yep.  This is Tarzan's song.  The band was Tarzan, right?  Yeah.  Then there's that other one.  What was that one with the video with the kicking robot legs? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Remember that one?  Herbie Hancock.  Herbie Hancock had a weird one, too.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Remember this one?  Yep.  Tarzan's.  Who thought this was going to...  I don't know.  Is that what this is called?  Yeah.  This is Tarzan's song.  Tarzan Boy by Baltimore.  Tarzan Boy.  This was a big song.  Yeah.  Give us another one.  Give us another one.  You're right.  Oh, yeah.  This was during the big dance-off in Beach Street they played this. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah?  No.  No.  No.  What about...  Boingo Boingo.  Herbie Hancock.  Herbie Hancock.  What was that song called?  That was a weird video.  Herbie Hancock.  Rock it.  Yeah, rock it.  Rock it.  Yeah.  One word, I guess.  Rock it.  Yeah.  Was this in a lot of movies, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is a weird video with the little artsy robot legs.  Yeah, he built a robot for this video. 
[01:33:00]  There was a few robots.  Yeah.  One that looked like a kick line.  They always looked like they were dancing and shit.  Did you ever have another song?  Oh, yeah, man.  He was huge.  Herbie Hancock was pretty big in writing soaring movies and shit.  Yeah, he did a lot of stuff.  But what's the song we all know?  I think this is, like, his big hit.  He did the song that was on in the Taxi and Prince of Tides.  I don't know, but I think he was involved with a lot of things that you go, oh, wow, that was Herbie Hancock. 
[01:33:30]  Maybe he wouldn't react that way.  Right.  I can see.  Oh, the Deo song from Beetlejuice.  Thank you, sir.  That's old.  Well, yeah, that's an old song.  Oh, but that's 80s.  Los Lobos had a song that was really big, too.  What was Los Lobos' song that was big?  They covered La Bamba.  Oh.  But those aren't weird like this.  And Axel F.  Axel F.  Ico Ico from Rain Man's coming in by P-R-I-C-O, whatever. 
[01:34:00]  Go with the easy Twitter name, please.  Why would you do that to yourself?  I don't know, man.  Why do I only have two followers?  What's your nickname?  Go with that.  Your name is fucking eight letters and fucking symbols.  Go nickname and then pick a number.  Yes.  And you're good.  This is from Rain Man.  Yeah.  I just said that.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  Yeah.  I just said that.  Yeah.  It's very busy.  It's Ico Ico, right?  Yeah.  I do a good impression of him.  Does Enigma count?  Or is that 290s?  Oh, I feel like it's going to have trouble. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, oh.  Exactly.  I misheard.  Yeah.  You know what?  Exactly.  She's a mother like everyone else.  Wow.  Go with the art of noise.  Art of noise.  You'll know this one.  Yeah?  Yes.  You got art of noise there.  You rock.  Oh, that's right.  Jan Hammer, a theme from Miami Vice.  That was a big one.  Yes.  And that was another one that was very 80s sounding musical, instrumental. 
[01:35:00]  Huh?  I don't think this is the one you want.  Shut up.  It says it's Vice City.  What are you looking in the mirror?  You don't have art of noise?  I forgot the name of the song, to be honest with you.  I didn't come to work thinking I'm going to need this knowledge today.  I know.  That's true.  I hate when this happens.  It's very difficult. 
[01:35:30]  I would have looked up some of this shit.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Born on a Sunday.  No.  On Being Blue, Paranomia, and Peter Gunn.  Peter Gunn, I guess.  Yeah, I think it was their version of Peter Gunn.  Yes.  Play that.  That's the wrong one.  Wrong one.  That didn't sound like Peter Gunn to me.  This is Dragnet. 
[01:36:00]  It was in Dragnet.  Yeah, this song.  This is just a cool song.  Yeah.  I don't like this version as good.  As much.  See, we all know this now.  I don't like this one, though.  But I'm just saying.  I don't like the ones with the real horns.  When this came out for the first time, it had to be string.  Yeah.  Now we know it.  But this is an old, old song that they redid. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's too weird.  This sucks.  Oh, yeah.  What?  I'm going to go Pointer Sisters.  Yep.  It's the Neutron dance.  Yeah.  Beverly Hills Cop.  Yeah.  It's very synthesized.  Was this in a lot of things? 
[01:37:00]  This was in Beverly Hills Cop.  The scene where Eddie Murphy's hanging on the back of the truck.  Because he's a cop.  And he's trying to bust the guys that are selling illegal cigarettes, I believe, out of the truck.  But it was in a lot of movies, though.  I'm thinking about the ones that pop up everywhere.  It's like boom, boom, boom, boom, cha-cha.  Achmel.  Ach-well.  Ach-well.  Ach-well.  By the way, Colin Hanks is around.  Are we having him in or no?  Did he say no?  Is he?  No.  We said yes to Colin Hanks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Not today, but he's in like tomorrow. 
[01:37:30]  But not today.  In the morning.  Yeah.  We say yes a lot these days.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's tomorrow 9.30, right?  Huh?  Huh?  Maybe we do have him.  When?  Tomorrow 9.30.  Another 9.30.  What?  We have him tomorrow.  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  Colin Hanks tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  The wonderful son of Tom Hanks.  God, we haven't talked to him in 10 years, probably.  I spoke with him at the Bruce Springsteen show. 
[01:38:00]  Does he remember being on our show?  Yes, he does indeed.  Because he was in for a wild fucking run.  Yes, he definitely remembered that one.  Yeah.  Which one was he in?  He was in for the midgets.  With Jack Black.  The midget stripping for the first time?  Oh, yeah.  She thought she wanted to be a stripper, so he said, come on in and we'll help you out.  And by the end of it, she was crying.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were horrified, but...  And Colin was in that day.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were horrified.  With Jack Black, when Jack Black was cool?  Oh.  Did he do the eyebrow thing?  No, he was...  Oh, look out. 
[01:38:30]  He gives the eyebrow.  No, something happened with the guy.  He used to do our show, and we really did like him a lot.  And then I don't know what happened.  I despise the guy.  Now we don't like him at all.  It really does only take one moment to start hating someone.  I don't know what it is with him, though.  Because he really...  I do remember he was all right.  I wasn't here that day, so I didn't interact with him on that day.  And Colin Hanks was great.  He looks just like his father.  It's kind of creepy.  Yeah.  Or back then he did.  I haven't seen him in many years.  Yeah, he still does.  He looks exactly the same as he did when he was on our show. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  He looks the same.  All right.  I guess that weird music bit ain't going anywhere.  Well, no, we just can't...  There are more, but I just can't think of...  Music from Fletch.  What was that?  Yeah.  Yeah, they had some weird tunes in Fletch.  But the ones that you hear...  I liked Fletch.  And that turned up in everything.  People are just mentioning 80s songs.  I know.  That's not what we're getting at.  It's not the deal.  We're getting at that quirky shit.  Yeah, it's very strange.  Like, I'm sure Weird Science had a weird fucking song in there, right?  Do you know how I phrase it? 
[01:39:30]  I say, what were they?  The soundtrack of our youth.  Yeah.  What is this?  It's like...  Weird Science.  Where does Zoingo Boingo?  Oh.  Now this just reminds me of that Scorch bit.  Which bit?  Weird news.  Weird news.  Oh, yeah.  The Scorch bit stunk.  Like, Don't Worry, Be Happy's coming in.  Yeah, that isn't it. 
[01:40:00]  That's been used in a bunch of movies, though.  Yeah, that's another one that's like...  It's just a regular song.  It's got to be a weird, electronical kind of...  Instrumental, really.  Even though there's words for this one.  The Miami Vice one.  From Jan Hammer.  The theme.  The actual theme to Miami Vice.  What was that?  Was one of those.  We had that arc?  I don't think I know that one.  Um...  Why was...  Why is the Slinky running to home in that dumb commercial?  I don't know.  It's off now. 
[01:40:30]  Oh!  And it had the blueberry pie!  Yeah.  All over her chest.  It'll trickle down to you.  It's not acceptable to us.  It was a time it was acceptable.  Women couldn't vote.  And blacks were in the back of the bus.  Uh...  A lot of things were acceptable until we stopped accepting it.  This is Wii shit.  Oh.  Oombayah.  Lean forward.  Hit it, Oombayah.  Stop.  That's good.  Yeah, this was definitely...  When did slandering prosecutors become acceptable?  Cocksucker.  Uh...  Douche. 
[01:41:00]  Is this it?  Miami Vice thing.  Yeah, it kicks in.  Does it?  Yeah, it does.  It kicks in.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Where?  Oh, oh, oh, it's building.  I hear it building in the background.  Like 20 layers of synth.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that neon-colored speedboat. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  We're wearing white fucking pants and jacket.  And, uh, white bucks with no socks, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Miami Vice is cool for five minutes.  Yeah.  Then what happened?  Yeah, the 90s.  Oh, right.  90s took a lot of things out.  Oh, yeah.  Kurt Cobain.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Might have messed some things up.  Miami Vice is a huge fucking...  They promoted the shit out of that before it came out.  Yeah, they did.  I remember, like, their spots that they had before it was aired.  All right, I got one.  Thanks to Mike Biondo from Atlanta.  Band called Trio.  Da, da, da.  Oh, I remember da, da, Dave.  Which we made very famous.  A bit we did.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Da, da, da.  Da, da, Dave.  This was the Volkswagen commercial back in the 90s. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  It was the two guys, and they're kind of bopping in the Volkswagen to this music.  And we did our own Drew Boogie shit back in the day.  So we took this and put our dumb program director into the song.  His angry phone call that he made to us once on the air.  Sounds like Tom Petty a little bit.  You can and what you can't.  Uh-huh.  King.  This is what you've got to know. 
[01:43:00]  Love you though it didn't show.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  If you can make a little bit.  Licky, licky.  We got to play the bit now.  Lick, lick, licky.  Lick, lick, licky.  Me and Ann were doing a double entendre gay bit at AF in Boston.  And our stupid PD got all pissed off.  We were talking about this commercial and the fact that it was a speculation that these  two guys in the commercial in the car were gay.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  And Dave got all upset about it and called us and told us to knock it off with the gay 
[01:43:30]  stuff again.  And we said, what do you mean?  I wish we had the original phone call.  We used to.  Yeah.  I might have it at home.  I've got to bring it in.  Because we baited him knowing we'd do something with it.  I knew we'd play the call in the air, which we did, and then we put it into the song.  Well, we baited him and he started reciting the lines he hated from the bit.  Yeah.  So we put it to music.  Can we go to break with that?  We put it to this song.  Let's go to break with that.  Da Da Dave, everybody.  Uh-huh. 
[01:44:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Hello.  Going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, you know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Uh-huh.  Gay, gay, gay zone.  You know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Uh-huh.  Licky, licky.  Licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick.  The old dirt road.  You do want to do it.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  The old dirt road.  Licky, licky.  What's the real dirt road?  Oh, shit.  going into the gay zone  yeah, going into the gay zone 
[01:44:30]  going into the gay zone  what a new uh  pokey pokey in the butt  yeah, gay zone  pokey pokey in the butt  pokey pokey in the butt  licky licky licky licky  lick lick lick pokey in the butt  yeah, licky licky  yeah, it's fun  pokey pokey in the butt  not really  Da, da, da.  Da, da, Dave. 
[01:45:00]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  That's pretty funny.  We've got Amy Schumer coming in in about ten minutes.  Yes.  Also, Ralph Macchio, the Karate Kid.  Yes.  In studio at what, 9.30?  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Allegedly.  Yes.  We've got 911 calls from the Miami face-eating attack.  Have you heard these yet?  No.  I did not.  I made a false one.  You did?  Did you?  Yeah.  What did you say?  Hey, there's a guy eating someone's face over here.  Over here.  Where, what's your location, sir?  Yeah, I'm right down by the face-eating incident.  Guys, just chowing down on his nose, eyes, ears, you know, facial features. 
[01:46:00]  Right over there by the roadway, faces being eaten off, gobble, gobble, salt, pepper, you  know, the whole routine.  They knew.  It was very, very believable.  Yeah.  It sounds it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smells like a bathroom over here.  Bath salts or something.  What do I know?  It's kind of like Brooklyn Chip.  All right.  We got a bath salt person, too.  An interview with a bath salt addict.  We didn't even know you could do this with the bath salts. 
[01:46:30]  But first, the 911 call from Miami.  Hi.  How you doing?  No, I'm just reporting, there's a naked man in front of the Miami Herald building next  to the highway.  He's throwing his clothes on the highway.  Do you want a pole, or?  He's, yeah, he was next to a pole, actually.  He was taking his clothes off and throwing them into traffic.  I have blackmail, curly hair, Rastafarian hair, goatee. 
[01:47:00]  Can't miss him.  He's naked.  Hello, Northeast 13th Street and North Bayshore Drive on the sidewalk, you know, the causeway,  MacArthur?  Is that bike lane sort of thing?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Maybe two bums who are going at it with each other.  Two bums.  Two bums going at it.  You are a bum.  The applicant is a bum.  Two bums. 
[01:47:30]  The first one picked his words.  I love this guy.  The first one picked his words very carefully.  This guy gets right to the point.  Two bums.  Two bums.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Maybe two bums who are going at it with each other, take up the whole lane.  I think they're fighting or something.  Listen, there's a naked man on the MacArthur's causeway.  At the end of the causeway coming forward, this came Boulevard.  He is beating another man to a pulp.  Like, on top of the man beating him, the man is bleeding. 
[01:48:00]  Somebody's beating on him?  Maybe that he's been beating?  You better send a Bama Lance.  I passed by and I saw what was happening.  I pulled over.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about this about you.  Okay.  Okay.  You're late.  Okay.  He's been beating, you said?  He's beating another man.  It's a naked man beating another man.  I'm beating him.  Naked.  Yeah, on the MacArthur causeway, like towards the Miami hill, it's at the end of the causeway.  But he's going to kill that man, I promise you.  Okay. 
[01:48:30]  Okay?  Thank you.  Okay, now you're welcome.  Governor.  Just three very different 911 calls there.  A naked man.  There's a naked man.  There are two bums.  I like the bum guy.  There's another call, I think, that came in.  Oh, was there?  Yeah, you've got to find the tape, though.  Oh.  Oh, let's try to find the...  My tape?  I know where it is.  Wait a minute. 
[01:49:00]  Around here.  What do you mean a tape?  We're looking for it.  We're looking for it.  Hang on.  All right.  We're going to have it in a second.  Oh, good thing.  How's it a tape if we've got to say, hello, who is this?  No, no, no.  What?  So we just play it.  Yeah, just press play.  Oh, we just press play?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We just press play.  Oh, I see.  So this is what, another 911?  One call that came in from Miami?  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  Oh, we found a tape.  Want to hear it?  Yeah, definitely.  I want to hear this.  All right.  Hi, 911. 
[01:49:30]  How are you doing?  So listen, I'm by the road or something, and there's a guy, he's having a bunch of, like,  a nose sandwich.  He's eating the other guy's kicks.  I was yelling, hey, what are you doing?  Getting cheeky or something?  He looks like the guy that used to help my mother fix the floorboards.  Oh, wow.  Oh, he's got, like, really curly hair or something, and I thought I had more for this call, but  I don't. 
[01:50:00]  Well, that was...  Did you give a location or anything?  No, that was the other 911 call we forgot about.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Terrible call.  Oh, you can say that again.  Oh, you should write it down first.  Oh, my face is hot.  A lot of people are telling us the Miami zombie prank video is fucking hilarious.  Did you see this?  I love that one, yeah.  I didn't see that either. 
[01:50:30]  It's some crazy fucking white guy.  So not prepared.  He's got a white shirt on with blood all over the front of it and everything.  Right.  And he walks up to just black people in Miami and starts going, ah, ah, and they run away  like fucking crazy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They run away petrified, scared.  Hang on.  It was a commercial.  Also vitamin water.  Commercial.  Oh, vitamin water is good for you.  I like vitamin water.  Sure, it's like you get your thirst and your vitamins taken care of in one gulp. 
[01:51:00]  I don't mind vitamin water.  I do like that stuff, yeah.  Vitamin water.  Nice and cold.  It's owned by Jay-Z or someone.  Yeah.  50 cent.  50 cent.  He's got the purple one.  He sold it.  The grape one.  He sold it?  He sold it.  How much did he make?  Quickly!  He had like $100 million.  Sold the thing.  Wow, that's crazy.  I'm making, man.  We know that.  It's not over.  Okay.  A zombie guy.  It's only the beginning.  Okay. 
[01:51:30]  He's just walking up to some big black woman putting shit in her trunk.  Is it a woman?  It's amazing this guy didn't get shot.  No kidding, man.  Because he's fucking chasing people and really scaring the shit out of them.  He's just chasing people.  They run.  Not for nothing, but that kid, he was going like, he was trying to do something.  I saw it.  It looked like he was, yeah.  He was going into like a stance like he was going to do something. 
[01:52:00]  Now he's following someone down the road.  They're just starting to run really quickly.  Very scared.  Boy, is he scaring some black people.  He's at a park.  They're all sitting on the picnic bench.  They're just scattered.  This takes balls.  Yeah.  He's doing the hunched over zombie walk thing with a bloody shirt on.  A basketball court?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  A bunch of kids on a basketball court, they're running.  And the one guy even, they all.  They got to pull their pants up running.  He's chasing them when they're all running.  I love how they got to hold their pants up when they run.  I want to see what he.  He's riding a bike.  No matter how big they are, they're running.  Oh, yeah, he's scaring the shit out of everybody. 
[01:53:00]  I've got to try this.  This is hilarious.  It must be because, because that's around Miami, so it must be because the people are so in tune with the story.  Or they just.  They just don't want to have their facey.  Crazy guy with a.  Yeah, they're like, who is this guy?  A shoe.  They just see a maniac.  He's chasing everyone away.  They're all petrified.  But he's going up to like fucking just groups of homeboys on the fucking basketball court. 
[01:53:30]  Some of them ain't moving.  Oh, now they're running.  Yeah.  They're all running.  The guy threw his basketball at the bloody zombie man.  He's got to have some kind of backup.  That's too brave, I'm thinking.  No, they all ran.  The group that originally wasn't going to run ran.  But you'd think someone would take a shot at them.  Dude, they're all running.  Especially if it's a group. 
[01:54:00]  How is everybody scared?  A whole bunch of them are running now.  Like, what do they think he is?  They're climbing the fucking fences.  They think he's a zombie.  Or do they think he's just a maniac who's bleeding?  Maybe.  I mean, they don't think he's a zombie.  Oh, he's got one guy coming up to him now.  And now they're all chasing him.  He's finally fucking.  Oh, shit.  They got him?  Well, I don't know what happened.  That's the big tease.  Now you've got to subscribe to get the next video. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, shit.  I wouldn't know.  Did he really get his ass kicked?  I don't know.  I would think you have some kind of backup to go.  Yo, yo.  We're just fucking around.  Or is there a stop where he goes, all right, look, I'm going to chase you in.  Just chase me.  We're doing a video.  Do you think they look like the kind of people that would be convinced to help out with the video?  Maybe.  Or if a backup guy says, hey, dude, we're just making a video.  If you get got like that, you're probably just so happy that it's not actually a fucking zombie?  Might be.  Yeah, you might be right.  I've seen some of those hidden camera shows.  It's a hell of a tease.  We'll find out.  I'm sure that he'll release another video. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  How many hits has that thing got?  Three and a half now.  Jesus.  Wow, yeah.  Good for you.  He did get shot at the two-minute mark.  You can hear it.  What?  Oh, stop it.  Jeff in Jersey.  What's up, buddy?  Yo, it's Joe in Jersey.  All right, Joe.  What do you got, buddy?  Yeah, if you scroll back to the two-minute mark, you can hear him actually getting shot at,  you can't see it, but obviously, you can hear like the sound of the gun going off.  Right around two minutes.  No, you can't.  There's something going on. 
[01:55:30]  It's not a gun.  He thinks that noise was an automatic.  Yeah, yeah.  That's part of the fucking music.  He was an idiot.  I wonder if...  What a buffoon.  That was funny that everyone ran off...  What do you think they thought it was? 
[01:56:00]  I mean...  They might have thought it was another guy on the fucking...  Just a maniac.  Oh, a guy just biting people.  Okay.  Yeah.  Or another guy on the fucking bath salts.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Because this guy's holding up.  That's why.  It's because this guy's holding his hand up like he's got something.  Ah, right.  Like he might have a gun.  He ain't got no gat, Joe.  He got no gun.  He ain't got no gat.  So are they still saying bath salts or are we on to LSD with this whole face?  I keep hearing bath salts.  Yeah, I wouldn't write it off. 
[01:56:30]  Okay.  The bath salt thing.  I've never tried that stuff, but anytime you start fucking around with like synthetic drugs...  Oh, that's a problem.  I've done them.  I guess you fucking zoted, man.  Zoted, Jim.  This bot was running around biting off fucking ears and stuff.  Yeah, you got zoted.  What are you having?  I'm having some ear pies.  Well...  Danny's got...  Ear pies.  I got to pull the video up for this dude, too.  All right.  Yeah, Danny brought a clip to the show.  That's funny, man.  They interviewed a bath salt addict.  There's bath salt addicts out there, huh?  Yes.  I guess. 
[01:57:00]  I had no idea.  I thought I was a bath salt addict when I couldn't get enough of my Cal gun.  Ah, it's Cal gun.  Take me away.  Yes, I know.  Well, we could just play from there, right, Danny?  Ah, probably.  Yeah.  It might be a little longer.  Really?  Fuck it.  But it's not that bad.  That's a good bad.  I want to hear him.  This really is his brain on drugs.  You remember that old commercial?  That's Freddie Sharp.  And he has to be tightly restrained by paramedics because he is high on bath salts.  As a matter of fact, he was ODing there.  Freddie's story is one of thousands about people chasing that next time. 
[01:57:30]  In the last week alone, a couple of cannibalism and self-mutilation cases could be linked to bath salts.  Freddie's story is not unique as a former user.  It's unique because he is a survivor.  How do you describe your experience?  Because we see the video of you and it looks like you're having these wild hallucinations and you're mumbling and talking out of your head.  What was going on in that video?  What was happening to you?  It was a very scary thing, actually. 
[01:58:00]  Whenever all that was going on, it was my overdose and everything.  And whenever that was going on, I never experienced anything like that, doing the bath salts or anything like that before.  And it really actually scared me pretty bad because I was hallucinating about being in a mental institution.  An insane asylum, basically.  And something about Jason Voorhees and getting possessed by him.  And I felt all kinds of crazy.  I want you to tell people what was going on. 
[01:58:30]  That's not his trailer.  In case anybody didn't hear that because the audio on this isn't the best.  We could probably switch over to the disc.  It's a lot better.  But he said that he was on the bath salts and he thought he was in a mental institution and that he was possessed by Jason.  By Jason Voorhees.  And he's telling all this outside his trailer.  I love that he knew the last name of Jason.  Yes, Voorhees.  Mrs. Voorhees.  And he looks like he's high right now.  Oh, he looks all fucked up.  All kinds of fucked up.  All kinds of fucked up.  He looks like if Seth Green wasn't doing as good as he was doing.  Yes, he does have a Seth Green look to him. 
[01:59:00]  He looks cleaned up compared to the fucking video of him on bath salts.  Disaster.  How do you describe your experience?  Because we see the video of you.  Oh, that's much better.  And it looks like you're having these wild hallucinations and you're mumbling and talking out of your head.  What was going on in that video?  What was happening to you?  It was a very scary thing, actually.  Whenever all that was going on, it was my overdose and everything.  And whenever that was going on, I never experienced anything like that, doing the bath salt or anything like that before. 
[01:59:30]  And it really actually scared me pretty bad because I was hallucinating about being in a mental institution,  an insane asylum basically, and something about Jason Voorhees and getting possessed by him.  And I felt all kinds of crazy.  I want you to tell people what was going on in your body, in your mind, in your head as we look at this video.  What was happening to you?  Fear, darkness, just, it felt like impending doom was coming down on me. 
[02:00:00]  And like, I was possessed.  Fucking impending doom.  Trying to stop whatever was in me from continuing further.  And it felt like I was about to bust loose and actually hurt some money.  That's why I was wrapped up the way that I was wrapped up in the fetal position and trying to keep my hands behind me and everything.  Because I felt like something was going to happen and I was going to bust loose.  And it was going to be a really bad situation.  And I never felt something like that before, some fear like that. 
[02:00:30]  And it was one of the most horrible experiences of my life.  I don't know why.  Something tells me that's not true.  Yeah.  Something tells me that wasn't one of the most horrible experiences of his life.  As he stands in front of his trailer at the trailer park with his fucking...  Fucked up.  He looks fucked up.  And he's missing his front teeth, you can tell.  Yeah.  Because he's trying to hold his lip to cover it.  Yeah, yeah.  And it looks pretty fucked up.  I don't know why I did it.  It happened.  It's behind me now.  And I'm trying to move on from it and everything. 
[02:01:00]  How old are you now, 27?  We got some 27.  27.  And you've been using for how long?  Bath salt.  Well, you've been using...  That was my favorite part, too.  Bath salt.  Well, no, because he's like, how long have you been using?  And then he was just like, yeah, to clarify.  He's like, oh, bath salt, because...  It depends what drug we're talking about here.  There's some I'm still using.  There's some I'm using right now.  Right.  Bath salt.  That says a lot.  Bath salt.  Well, you said you've been using drugs. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I've been an addict since that I was basically 13, 14 years old.  Yeah.  So kids start young using these drugs.  How are you doing now?  Do you still have...  Do you still use bath salts?  No, I do not.  You don't?  I do not use bath salts.  I haven't used bath salts in months.  Do you know people who still use them?  And if so, what do you tell them? 
[02:02:00]  I mean, there are people, I'm sure, that are out there still using them.  He knows.  The only thing that I can say to them is, if you value your life, you'll stop it, and  you won't do it anymore, because it'll destroy your life.  It'll destroy your family.  Bath salt.  I saw the little lid on the bath salt.  It was called Serenity Now Bath Salt.  Really?  Serenity Now!  What are they, like crystals?  So you gotta, like...  I guess.  Cook that shit up?  I like the Hoochie Mama bath salt, though, myself.  Smoke that shit?  What do you do? 
[02:02:30]  I don't know.  How do you take it?  Let's buy some.  Ah, shit.  Let's enjoy the most amazing aromatic effect on the market.  What does it say about it?  Serenity Now Bath Salt.  Now the most potent name has come to bath salts.  Enjoy this amazing bath salt that guarantees to be the strongest aromatic experience you've  ever tried.  This product is two to three times more potent than anything on the market.  And it says for external use only.  So, literally, they're advertising it as you put it in your bathtub, and fucking, you  know, ah, it's got an aroma to it and everything, but people are taking it other ways. 
[02:03:00]  How do they take it?  Do they smoke it?  Smoke or eat it?  What are they doing?  You eat it.  I don't know, man.  I eat that fucking shit.  I don't know this stuff.  I would imagine that you'd probably sniff it.  You'd probably sniff it.  Maybe snort it?  Those are big crystals.  What, you grind it up?  We went through every way.  Do you shoot it?  Serenity Plus?  Serenity Plus.  Doesn't sound to me like it gives a very serene feeling.  Ah.  Good one, right?  That is good.  That's good.  We bought a Diet Coke instead of getting the free one in the back.  What are you doing with my money? 
[02:03:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Hold on.  What are we doing?  Spend off.  Oh, he's talking into the sandwich.  He's talking into my wrap.  That's crazy.  Oh, you got a wrap, did you?  Jesus.  Why don't we know how this is taken?  I don't know.  I'll Google it.  Yeah, I'm going to guess that you might even melt it down and shoot it.  Well, let me go to Jack in Long Beach.  Jack, what do you know about the bath salt?  I'm guessing smoke it.  Cook it and smoke it.  I'm getting snorted.  Cook it and smoke it.  Cook it and smoke it. 
[02:04:00]  That show, Intervention on A&E, had a bath salt addict.  I don't remember what season it was.  It was on demand.  The guy was all kinds of fucked up.  He would use it multiple times a day.  I'm pretty sure he smoked it, like smoking crack.  And he thought people were watching him and installing cameras around his house.  He would take apart random electronics.  And his mom would come home and the VCR would be all over the dining room table in pieces.  He'd climb up onto his roof. 
[02:04:30]  Even when he wasn't doing anything, he just wasn't right.  I'm not surprised bath salt is the doctor.  Did you see the show?  They actually interviewed the guy.  His name was Eric something, the black guy who was the guy who attacked before on a bath salt show.  And they said that they kind of knew something was amiss.  Because they were like, what did he say?  It makes me really crazy.  And I just craved noses. 
[02:05:00]  What the fuck?  I knew I really had nowhere to go with that.  I don't even know what the fuck.  That he just wanted to crave noses.  He wanted to eat a nose.  And he can't get them anywhere.  He said, when I was a kid, you'd buy a bag of noses.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Are you on bath salt?  Shit, Jimmy.  Jesus. 
[02:05:30]  All right, Jack.  Thank you for that.  You're welcome.  This guy says you're snorted and it doesn't make you bite people's faces.  Oh, okay.  Here's someone that could take it.  Something that could handle is fucking drugs.  Larry, you do the bath salts every once in a while.  Larry.  Larry.  You're going to find your face eating in the hallway, Larry.  Larry.  Your mother's face, Larry.  Fuck you.  I did this stuff for a little while last year, man.  You chop it up.  You snort it like Coke.  It's like a Coke high. 
[02:06:00]  You're happy to be wherever you are.  It doesn't make you do shit like that, man.  Oh, okay.  We'll take your word for it.  You didn't eat anybody's face?  No, no.  There's more to it than that, man.  There's something that they ain't telling us.  Bath salts does not make you eat people.  Amy, do you do bath salts?  Is that the new drug?  That seems to be the new craze.  All the kids are doing it.  No, but I'm interested.  All the kids are into it.  Would you try it?  I haven't tried it.  What happens?  You eat people's faces.  Yeah.  Oh, is that what the face eater was like? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I'll take my chances.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It sounds fun.  Yeah.  Let's try one day.  Go ahead.  Take the water.  Go ahead.  Can I have this water?  You sure can.  Go ahead.  At one point, we have a story to get out of Amy.  Oh, God.  I was like, oh, I don't know if I want to talk about that.  Why?  Oh, Amy.  Why else are you here?  God.  What do you mean?  I'm, uh, I'm...  Wait, it sounds like you have a good story.  Jimmy?  It's up to her?  Ah, he throws it out there. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I mean, we've all had sexual dark days.  I feel like last time I was here, I remembered my sleep rape, and I shouldn't come back in  here this time.  This is worse than the sleep rape.  Really?  Really?  You remember something else?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  More of my youth is coming back to me.  And by youth, I mean five years ago.  You know what?  And I might have even told the story on here.  I'm not sure.  Did I ever talk about when a cab driver fingered me on here?  I don't think I remember that one.  I swear to you, it sounds familiar.  Doesn't it?  It kind of sounds familiar. 
[02:07:30]  I mean, I talk about it a little bit on stage now.  Oh, maybe.  Just as, like, the end of a thing, but I don't know if I told the story.  But I would feel really awful if I had already told the story.  No, I just remember the one with the ship.  I've heard it in your act.  Oh, the eating man on the ship.  Oh, no.  Oh, okay.  You've only heard my act.  Okay.  Yeah.  Amy and I took a cab home from Top Papa's last night.  You fingered Amy in the cab?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  Wait.  She fingered my ass outside the cab before we got in to propel me forward?  That's sweet.  No, we were both...  Amy lives not that far from me, so we split a cab going up. 
[02:08:00]  I forget how it came up.  Well, after you told the cab driver to drive you back to the luxury apartments.  Oh, yeah.  And then you let him know that I live in a six-floor walk-up.  Oh, that's good, Jimmy.  Yeah.  No, I told Amy to get out of her house three fucking doors down.  Because...  Because we're yapping.  She's talking about this guy.  Oh.  And she's like, it's been a while since I've had sex.  I mean, this time of year, I like to fuck.  Oh, no.  She's saying this in the back of the cab.  Oh, yeah, she's blathering on.  I wasn't even thinking about it.  And the fucking creepy cabbie with two little scars on his cheek is hearing all this freaking 
[02:08:30]  ass.  I didn't even think about it.  White cabbie?  Yeah.  It's sexually assaulted.  White cabbies are the scariest cabbies in New York City.  But I said to her...  Sorry, white cabbies.  He was white?  I said, get out of your fucking...  That's scary.  ...a few doors away.  Get out three doors away.  I said to her, I'm like, text me as soon as you get, so you know.  I'm sort of offended he didn't go for it after that.  Yeah, right?  She was loud, though.  I'm sorry.  No, I don't care.  I didn't even think about it.  I had to fuck this time of year.  That's how I sound.  That's how I sound.  Oh, God.  So what happened with the cab driver?  Now you've got to tell the story.  Okay. 
[02:09:00]  Well, first of all, can I just say, I really...  It's been like...  This is the longest I've ever gone, I think, without having sex.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  These are the first words I've spoken this morning, so it sounds pretty tranny.  Sorry.  And...  How long has it been?  Like, a month and a half?  Wow.  A month and a half.  That's a lot for, like, that's a lot.  Yeah, yeah, that's a long time.  That's built up.  Yeah.  So, anyway, I went in, I had, like, a fitting to try stuff on for this thing.  I'm doing it at Bonnaroo, the music festival.  Whoa, look at you. 
[02:09:30]  I know.  Nice.  And this girl, this little Asian chick, barely spoke English, was, like, helping me at the fitting.  And she, like, fully molested me.  Like, she kept coming in the room when I was naked, and it wasn't, like, part of her job.  And she would, like, put, she, like, put the dress on me, but, like, touched my boobs.  Wow.  And, like, she was, like, smoothing it over me, but touching everyone.  Ah, I love that smoothing.  She was, like, 25.  She wasn't, like, a mom that had, like, seen some shit, and she didn't care.  Like, she had changed.  She was, like...  And I was so, I'm so pent-up sexually. 
[02:10:00]  Like, literally, this five-foot-two, non-English-speaking Asian woman, I was, like, if she goes for it, I'm on board.  I'm just going.  I'm going.  Yeah, yeah.  I left there, like, looking at her.  And I just, like, told him what I wanted and left.  And I was, like, God, I would have just thought that Asian woman was so horny right now.  You've got to think if you're a lesbian, you would take a job like that, though, where you get to knock on the door.  Is everything fitting okay?  And you get to come in.  Need some help in there?  Yeah, you get to pick and choose what door you knock on, and you go in and see some nudity. 
[02:10:30]  But it's like being a gyno.  Like, you've got to take the bad with the good.  I argue that point all the time.  You don't have to knock on the door.  I would do that.  You would have a screening process?  No, I mean, I would understand that you're going to see some old, you know, bent-up vaginas to see young ones.  Some diseased ones, though.  Who cares?  You'd want to see a lip with cancer on its tail.  It would still be a great job.  And I think you go into a job like that because you really want to see a lot of vaginas. 
[02:11:00]  I don't know.  I think you'd get so desensitized.  It would lose.  That's what they tell you.  Yeah.  Because that's what they have to tell their, you know, their loved ones.  I don't think there's, I don't think, I really don't think there's even one doctor out there.  Like, I just get to stare at puss all day.  They're not going to tell you that.  I just, I don't believe it.  You ready?  Hopefully he's a pediatrician.  This comes up a lot.  Doctors call up our show and be honest.  Tell us if it's just a vagina after a while.  I think it always is a magical place. 
[02:11:30]  I think doctors don't listen to this show.  Yeah, that's true.  They do.  It's all a magical place.  Magical place.  What about the cab driver?  Finger in your head.  Oh, God.  It's so dark.  It's bad.  All right.  Take your time.  When did this happen?  A lot of details.  This is so bad.  When did it happen, by the way?  What were you wearing?  I remember what I was wearing.  Yeah, what were you wearing?  Oh, Jesus.  This is so awful.  Could it be any less appealing with my morning voice?  I just want to hear it.  Oh, don't worry.  It's great.  Lucille Ball.  I sound like I have leprosy.  Give me some McGillicuddy finger here.  Viv came up.  How old were you? 
[02:12:00]  I was 18.  Oh.  Oh, God.  This is so awful.  This is the worst.  To tell.  This is the worst.  Okay.  But it sucks.  18.  Because the weekend after I left here, I was on the road, and then people who heard the show  came, and whenever I would make a rave joke, they'd all be like,  Oh.  Oh.  So now, when I say my super sweet fingering joke, they're all going to be like, ooh.  Oh, ooh.  Creepy.  Okay.  This is exactly what happened.  To tell.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  And then, you guys should come see my special.  I'm taping it out. 
[02:12:30]  Our special.  Of course.  The Fillmore in San Francisco on June 23rd.  Ooh.  The Fillmore.  Please, come out, San Francisco.  That's very cool.  Yes.  I'm in Schumer.  Yeah.  18.  What were you wearing?  Were you still in high school?  Atlanta punchline tomorrow.  The summer?  Okay.  I was.  The summer of your senior year?  It was the summer.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  It was the summer.  It was the summer going into my sophomore year of college.  Oh, wow.  So, yeah.  18.  Maybe I just turned 19.  Mm-hmm.  So, we were driving home from a bar. 
[02:13:00]  I was in the front seat of the cab.  Front seat?  All my friends are in the back.  Oh, okay.  But I remember choosing the front seat on purpose.  Oh, why?  Because I'm a huge whore.  Wait, did you get a look at the driver before you chose the front seat?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And let me tell you.  Disgusting.  Wow.  Nice.  He was, he was like not, he looked like a cab driver.  Right.  What city?  I wasn't like, oh, we hit the jackpot with the one hot cab driver.  Oh, okay.  What city were you in?  New York. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  What nationality was he?  He was white.  And what were you wearing?  I was wearing a mini skirt.  Oh, boy.  And a tube top, which was my uniform at the time.  Even though I was another good two dozen pounds that I am right now.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I had no idea.  A little chubby girl in the front seat.  I had no idea.  Chubby and eager.  Great.  Chubby and eager.  Just wanting those fingers.  Oh, God.  Anything.  This is so awful.  Yeah.  My dad lives in a hospital and like his friends listen to this show.  We heard your daughter today.  They'll love it. 
[02:14:00]  It's true.  They're going to love this.  They will miss.  He's going to be so proud.  Yeah.  So, I was sitting in the front and my friends were in the back, wasted.  And sort of one at a time, they got out.  And I was getting out with my last friend, who was like asleep in the back.  And I was just drunk.  And I was going through a phase where I like to get in a lot of trouble sexually and sort  of do stuff that scared myself.  God.  I would go home with the...  It was fucking...  This is great.  I know.  I am loving this. 
[02:14:30]  This is really hot.  Wow.  So...  I hope you're not looking for sympathy.  I just...  This is really hot.  This is such a mistake.  I hope you are looking for cum.  I'm...  I'm regretting...  I'm not only regretting coming here, I'm regretting ever doing comedy.  Yeah.  So, I just like was sort of...  I think I just wanted to feel like I was really turning him on.  Like, making him go out of his mind.  So, I just was sort of like...  Like, I just sort of kind of like was sliding my leg over to him. 
[02:15:00]  Why am I saying this on here?  I hate this.  While you're driving in the cab or while you're parked?  Yes, while he's driving.  We were...  My friend was asleep in the back.  So, you're opening your little chubby legs.  Your little chubby legs.  I refer to them as sturdy back then.  Okay.  Oh, man.  So...  So, you're moving your left leg toward the cab driver.  So, he's driving.  Oh, I'm just driving here.  I'm so impressed.  Imaginary driving.  And then, like, right next to him...  I need, like, a publicist.  He starts moving closer.  Just talk about your...  And he's probably like, did he look over? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, he looked over.  Yeah.  I bet he looked over.  He was like, what is going on?  So, now...  And then what happened?  And he sort of, like, was like...  How does he make the move?  So gross.  How does he make the move?  What happened?  Your legs are opening.  He didn't make the move.  I took his hand and put it...  Oh, my God!  I knew it!  This is the greatest thing ever!  You took his hand and just put it on your young 19-year-old...  18.  I put it on my skirt and...  Wait, wait, where exactly did you put his hand?  On?  On your left thigh?  Or did you put it ground zero? 
[02:16:00]  I went right...  Oh, my God!  I thought maybe he, like, a little leg so he could rub your leg a little first.  No.  You went right for the...  You said you put that foreplay...  That hand that he coughed in and was digging in his nose all night?  That all that bad money went through?  He looked like the MTV cab driver.  Remember that guy?  Yeah, she was greasy.  Oh, wow.  There was nothing, like, attractive about this dude.  What a banner night for this guy.  So she's sleeping in the back?  This guy must have lost his mind.  And he...  Yeah, and I...  You know, we only had, like, 20 blocks to go, so I was like, this guy better get to work. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, he probably fucking...  Oh, that guy.  That really looks like him.  So, I bet you anything, this guy's, like, a listener to this show.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  So you put his hand right on your puss?  I put his hand right on my puss.  Oh, yeah.  And, um...  And, yeah.  Wait, wait.  He, uh...  Was everything ready to go?  Were you, uh...  What are you talking about?  Was, uh...  Were you ready to accept him?  Were you...  How dry does a girl have to be that you can't get a finger in there? 
[02:17:00]  Well, that's...  Wow.  But, yeah, I was turned on.  I was excited.  I was, yeah.  Just thinking about it.  Did you have panties on?  Yeah.  Okay, so what did he pull them aside or did you...  Moved them to the side.  Oh, my God.  I moved them to the side.  Oh, you were just eager.  You victimized him, basically.  Yeah.  Yeah, you raped the guy.  So...  I know.  When I tell a story, I say I let a cab driver finger me, but really, I took his hand.  Yeah, you raped him.  Exactly.  So what did he...  What happened?  He...  Yeah, he did what you do with a vagina.  So he fingered you.  He fingered me and rubbed my clitoris until I achieved orgasm. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, was it good?  Oh, you came.  You did.  I came.  Oh, my God.  And then he...  And then, like, we got where we were going.  Did you go for the quiet orgasm?  Yeah.  Not to wake your friend?  Yeah, like, trying not to make a sound.  Did you rub his dick?  No.  Little meows and...  I did not touch him.  Did he ask you to?  No.  No, but what happened was we got where we were going.  And so, like, my friend in the back kind of woke up.  And he was like, where are we taking this party?  Like, he was kind of like...  Of course.  Yeah, of course.  That's good. 
[02:18:00]  And I was...  He was the winner of Gash Cab.  Oh, my God.  How long have you been sitting on that?  I just thought of it.  That's very funny.  That just popped up.  That was too good.  That was strong.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  No, not Chip.  It was like Pussy of Fortune.  No, no.  That doesn't work, Chip.  Not Pussy of Fortune.  Chip, that doesn't work.  How long did...  Oh, God.  How long did it take to come?  I hate thinking of the plot points of this show.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:18:30]  How many blocks?  We get it.  I know.  How many minutes?  I came right before we got there.  So, what happened?  He wanted to know, and what did you pay for the thing?  The cab?  Yeah.  Did he make you pay?  Wow.  What?  What is that?  Not even on the house?  What a dick.  I love it.  She wasn't going to jerk him off.  He's like, all right, 850.  It was easier for him to separate the dollar bills.  Me and my friend.  He fucking made you pay?  Me and my friend.  I'm sure we split it.  I would not have been like this.  So, wait.  What did he say to you?  He was like...  So, as soon as I came, I was disgusted with myself and him. 
[02:19:00]  And he was just like, where are we going?  We?  And I was like...  And I just got out of the cab, and I was like, come on, let's go to the girl.  And he was like, wait.  Well, like, you know, he was confused.  Confused, yeah.  And then I was kind of scared.  And we went inside the house.  And then I felt really gross about it, of course, because it's fucking really gross.  That is pretty gross.  And so, I, and I like, yeah, we walked away from the cab, and I felt so bad about it. 
[02:19:30]  I told my mom the next day.  Why would you do that?  Because I was like, what's going on with me?  Why am I...  How do you tell your mom that?  I told her.  I was like...  It was sort of like, I think it was really selfish of me, just to want to get some guilt  out of my life.  Wow.  So, what did she do when you told her?  No, she probably turned on.  Oh, God.  Yeah, she just...  She grabbed Amy's hand and put it on her vagina.  Yeah, she made me kiss her.  And she asked, oh, is it the black one that I've hooked up with?  I'm like, oh, mom.  Mom.  That's so mom.  Oh, no.  Wow.  So, what did she say to you? 
[02:20:00]  I think she was concerned.  Yeah.  And, um, and she, but she was like, she comforted me.  Like, it's okay.  Like, what do you say to your daughter?  Mom, um.  There, there.  I just let...  Now, was the, um...  Sorry.  I was going to have a turn on it.  Could you imagine, like...  Oh, sorry.  Could you imagine, like, something happened to a boy, like a little boy, and, like, the  boy goes to his dad and has to explain it and got jerked off in a cab?  Like, that would just never happen.  Dad, I got jerked off in the cab.  It'd be like, that's what it was.  Oh, no. 
[02:20:30]  Exactly.  But, you know what?  Like, that is still...  I like, I like watching porn where the guy's really gross.  Yeah.  And the girl's, like, beautiful and, like, innocent and young.  Oh, nice.  Wait, so you were molested by an ugly guy.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, when you're...  Watch my home movies.  When you were...  No, I'm saying when you were a lot younger.  See?  The flow chart.  Yeah, it goes back to Jimmy's flow chart.  You were molested by some greasy old guy.  Oh.  Well, I don't remember.  Older guy that's...  That's a great...  If that happened, I don't...  That memory hasn't come up yet.  That's a good molestation if you don't remember. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  That just means it was really deep.  Yeah, those are the best ones when your memories go buh-bye.  Oh, my God.  Let me ask you this.  Have you ever gone back in time and masturbated to that whole scenario?  No.  No, that made me, like, really ill for a while after.  And I think only now that it's, you know, over 10 years later can I...  It's crazy.  Well over 10 years.  Shut up.  Where were you...  Shit.  Fuck you.  I'm just kidding.  That's fucking funny.  She's petting?  Petting a couple years?  Oh, shit.  Amy, where were you coming from? 
[02:21:30]  What a dick.  I'm just teasing her.  You fucking monsters.  I'll be changing your diapers in less than a decade.  Where were you coming from that you couldn't...  A bar.  But you couldn't hook up at the bar?  Somebody was guest bartending.  It wasn't about that.  It was about being self-destructive.  That's self-destructive.  Yeah.  Yeah, she didn't want to hook up and have an actual connection.  I did a bunch of self-destructive, dangerous kind of stuff.  Was that after the rape?  Yeah.  Oh, see?  Okay.  I don't know if it was all after that.  Yeah.  Why didn't you touch his penis? 
[02:22:00]  Wouldn't that have played into what you were going for that night?  No.  No?  No.  That was just self-punishment.  All self-punishment.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  After the...  Crazy.  Wow.  It was crazy.  I did crazy stuff then.  I'm not going to tell any more today because it's a lot.  But there was...  There's got to be stuff even crazier than that.  What were grosses?  That was the grosses.  That was one of the...  How many...  That was up there.  How many guys most have you been with at one time?  One.  Oh, that's it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, no. 
[02:22:30]  I never was just like a cum dumpster, no.  I never was a cum dumpster.  And it was always very selfish about me.  I didn't go nuts on everybody's talks.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Thanks.  A lot of people say the cab driver remembers this story and tells it a lot.  Oh, he's still telling that one.  As you were telling it, he was telling it.  Because he's telling it all the fucking time.  I wonder if he...  I bet he looks like a listener of this show.  Yeah.  And I bet...  It was me.  Oh, God.  It's a lot of cab drivers saying that.  Dude!  Dude, it was me, dude! 
[02:23:00]  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, that would be good.  I hope it was fucking Big A.  He used to drive a fucking delivery car.  I...  Fing...  Fing...  Fing...  Fing...  Fing...  Big A was at the cellar this weekend.  Was he?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He gets a rain out.  He does.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  Because we're not going to beat the Amy show.  Amy Schumer getting fingered by a cabbie story right now.  I'm going to go in the bathroom and jack off thinking, oh, yeah, fuck yeah.  Do myself.  We're all going to the bathroom.  I'm going to find somebody to grab their hand and shove it on my cot.  Much like Amy Schumer does.  What a little whore.  We have to plug. 
[02:23:30]  Well, let me get Amy's out of the way.  Amy's filming her big Hommie Central special.  Amy got plugged with those cabbie fingers.  On June 23rd at the Fillmore in San Francisco.  How do people get tickets for this, Amy?  If they...  I don't know.  It's like a website.  You've got to go in the Fillmore.  Google Amy Schumer.  It's like a website.  Comedy Central.  All right.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah.  You really should go.  I'm at the Nashville Zanies Thursday.  Atlanta Punchline tomorrow.  Wow.  You're all over the place.  And Augusta, Georgia on Monday.  What?  Wait.  So you're doing Georgia, Tennessee, and then back to Georgia. 
[02:24:00]  Back to Georgia, Bonnaroo.  My special.  And then Illinois, man.  Wow.  Oh, Illinois.  You're getting around.  I am.  That's great.  Yeah.  Well, I've got to meet new cab drivers.  You obviously always get around.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  That's fucking sexy shit right there.  It really is.  It really is.  Guys thinking like, wow, that's fucking really hot.  You want to take phone calls from guys that jerked off to that story?  Oh, God.  I don't believe it.  Let me get my phone out.  We'll take calls from guys that jerked off to that last Amy Schumer story after the break. 
[02:24:30]  Jimmy, what do you got there, buddy?  This Saturday, I'm obviously in MGM and Foxwoods with Artie, Nick, and Attell.  And I fucked up so badly with my tweet yesterday.  You did.  We're doing right at the Chicago market August 11th at the Horseshoe Casino.  It's in Hammond, Indiana.  It's myself, Artie Lang, Nick, and Dave Attell.  And tickets are on sale this Friday, 10 a.m.  I just totally fucked up the plug and everything.  All right.  And also, this just came in. 
[02:25:00]  Greatest drive to work story ever.  See?  People loved it.  Ever.  Loved it.  And they're calling.  So guys were jerking off.  So more with Amy Schumer.  Sirius XM.  It's the OP-ed entry show.  So sweet.  Oh, that's sweet.  I feel good now. 
[02:25:30]  Oh.  Sometimes you get in a cab.  Yeah.  You want more than a ride home.  Riga!  Your fingers smell!  What's on your hand, Riga?  Oh, God.  God.  Well, I'm going to go to Craig in Montreal.  All right.  Craig.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hi, sir.  Hey, well, that was a pretty good story, Amy, I must say.  I was out in my tool shed fixing up some stuff,  and there was a guy out spraying the lawn for some chemicals, 
[02:26:00]  so I had to close the door and fucking rub one out.  Oh, I thought you were going to ask him to come.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  I'll give you a couple of fingers.  Help me out.  How do you feel that a guy all the way up there in Montreal  just whacked off to your story, Amy?  All the blood just rushed to my head.  I feel pretty embarrassed.  Why?  Because you had to ease your leg over,  take his hand, and shove it in your vagina?  What's wrong with that?  It's nice.  I don't know.  I guess I just...  What a hint.  I guess I've just never been in a tool shed.  Why don't you try something more subtle? 
[02:26:30]  How did you let him know?  Way to leave him guessing.  Yeah.  That's that body language we're taught to read from a girl.  Yeah.  What is that?  But I think just me...  Your legs flew up like a mousetrap closing.  Read between the lines.  That's good.  Amy.  It's just so cool to talk about because it's just a cool story for a guy to hear.  Oh, God.  And it's past you.  I mean, please.  Oh, yeah.  I'm way past it now. 
[02:27:00]  Do you regret doing the self-destructive stuff?  I regret talking about it here.  Ah, that's probably the biggest regret you should have.  I don't know.  I guess I don't regret anything that I've done sexually.  Wow.  That's how girls rationalize, by the way.  I have no regrets.  No, I mean...  And then they cry for no reason in the middle of the night.  I can't be slowly fucked and have to be a pounding.  Oh, really?  What are you doing with this slow fucking shit?  Stop looking in my eyes!  Yeah, I agree with the eye-looking thing. 
[02:27:30]  It's got to go.  You don't like the eye-looking thing?  No!  Wow.  For what?  I know.  Sometimes it's fun.  I don't...  If it's like a...  Yeah.  If it's not...  Search it out, but I don't mind it.  I'll say...  If I'm saying something hot...  You don't like looking in the eyes.  You take this.  Mmm.  Yeah.  What do you think of these apples?  Have you ever kept your eyes or looked a girl in the eye while you were having an orgasm?  Oh, man.  That's nuts.  You should do that.  Gotta hide the face.  No, I gotta hide.  No, I don't make a really dumb face when I come, though.  I really don't.  How do you know?  Because I've fucking...  I've had many reports. 
[02:28:00]  Airplane bathrooms.  Because it changes from his normal face.  Oh, you yeeby-hoo.  No.  No.  Do I look in the eyes while I'm coming?  Try it.  I have...  With paid sex things.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Massage therapist.  Wow.  So you can look in the eyes of, like, a hooker.  Stranger, yeah.  Stranger, but not someone you might like.  No.  For what?  I, uh...  For what? 
[02:28:30]  We know who each other is.  I don't mind that.  But the orgasm has to be, uh, like, you know, uh, turn the head's gotta go into the pillow  or something.  It's gotta be...  Really?  Yeah.  I just don't know what I...  Mix it up.  I don't know what it looks like.  It's fun.  It's gotta look silly as fuck, though.  It does.  It looks crazy.  But if you trust the person, it's funny.  It looks crazy.  Yeah, it looks like you're losing your mind.  The real John Baker.  Amy's story is like a filthy Harry Chapin song.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  She put my hand on her pussy. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God.  That's good.  What was that stupid song?  Taxi.  Taxi.  Right, right, right, right.  Oh, man.  Someone's gonna do that.  She said, my pussy's Harry.  I said, yes, it is, Sue.  Harry and Sue.  Of course.  You were all groomed up, I'm sure.  We groomed up nice, at least, for the cab driver?  Yeah, were you shaved back then or no?  I was.  Back in the 18s?  I was.  When you had a little landing strip back then? 
[02:29:30]  I probably had a landing strip, yeah.  Yeah, I don't think all the girls were going...  Star of David.  ...sons hair yet.  They weren't doing the hairless as much, right?  I made it look like an eyebrow, so it looked like it was winking at him.  Hey.  Hey, fella.  Amy Schumer, big Comedy Central special.  Yes.  Do we have more info on that, finally?  Yeah, to get tickets, go to tinyurl.com slash free Amy Ticks.  Nice, okay.  T-I-X.  Why don't you just Twitter the link?  It's June 23rd. 
[02:30:00]  June 23rd, I will.  I will, I will.  Fillmore, San Francisco, Comedy Central special with Amy Schumer.  No one says go to tinyurl, you just fucking click the link.  Well, you'll tweet it, too.  I'll tweet it.  Oh, Amy.  Please come, San Francisco.  Amy Schumer on Twitter.  What else is going on, Amy?  Oh, God.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Why is it on me?  Oh, God.  Let's get Bear Grylls in here.  Yeah, boy.  You like the Bear Grylls, huh?  Yeah.  Did you like him?  Are you attracted to him?  No.  Or did you just like his show?  I, neither.  Oh.  No, no. 
[02:30:30]  No, he was like...  She would have liked Paul Williams yesterday.  Why?  Oh, little Paul Williams.  He's kind of an ugly...  Uriah, she would have liked.  Oh, jeez.  Trollish.  Oh, right.  She would have liked that guy.  If he's listening.  You know her in the...  I like ugly guys.  Now we're in Dutch with him again.  He knows it.  I like ugly guys.  He knows it.  I like guys with something wrong, so they're really appreciative.  Aw.  We had...  That is sweet.  I'll take a baby arm any day.  We had Anthony Bourdain.  We had Paul Williams, and we had Uriah Faber.  Wow. 
[02:31:00]  Anthony Bourdain, that guy really tells it like it is.  So, which guy would you have allowed to finger you if you were 18?  The one I've heard of, Bourdain.  Bourdain?  Who are the other ones?  Uriah.  It's, uh...  Uriah Faber's a UFC bantamweight fighter.  Okay, I want to change my answer.  In perfect shape.  Yeah, you probably want to bang Uriah.  Perfect shape with a clucked chin.  He's a handsome guy.  I bet Bourdain knows how to get down, though.  Probably will, yeah.  Don't you think?  It's been around the block, as they say.  I don't know.  He used to do a lot of drugs, right? 
[02:31:30]  I don't know.  He hinted to it yesterday.  Oh, LSD.  Right, right, right.  And he talked about smoking crack.  I don't know if he was going for a joke or not.  He's got a wide rib cage.  He's got so many muscles, I can't identify them all.  Dude, it's fucking...  He's a turtle shell.  Yeah.  He's, uh...  Wait, how do you get the side abs?  Dude, that guy fucking must do...  He probably does sets of 20 crunches for fucking hours.  Yeah, that's crazy.  We took the picture, and he had his fucking traps, that little neck bump.  It's like a rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, he really...  His obliques have a six-pack. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Looks like he has a brain, like, under his nipples.  A turtle shell.  Can you go to his Twitter?  He literally tweeted the worst picture ever taken of me.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  And he has, like, millions of followers.  I'm like...  Oh, no.  No, he's got, like, 200,000.  He's got a lot, but he's not...  I told Jimmy, I go, I look like a balding idiot.  I don't think my hair looks like that normally.  I don't know.  Oh, we gotta see where they're...  I was...  What's his ethnicity with that name?  I don't know.  He's just white Californian kid.  Uriah Faber.  Really?  Yeah, he's the California kid. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, California kid.  You don't know where...  Yeah.  It was after you left, Dan.  He took a picture with me, and Jimmy said he had a good time and tweeted it.  Oh.  Look at him.  I look like a baby.  Oh, you don't look like that.  You look like a car salesman there.  I don't look like that, right?  No, you don't look like that.  Help me out, Amy.  You don't look like that.  I got killed yesterday.  Help me out.  Your hair looks parted there.  That's a weird shot.  That's not at all what you look like, but that is a terrible, terrible picture.  Really?  I finally get a nice hit on Twitter.  And you're all like...  Good picture of Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy, that is a good picture. 
[02:33:00]  You look very charming there.  Yeah, Jimmy's smiling.  Are you lying?  Devilish.  No, I'm not lying.  We had visitors, so I was using my wife's stuff, and it doesn't just say shampoo on her  bottle, so I had to guess.  And I think I might have picked one that's a bit greasy.  Did you wash with the conditioner?  It doesn't say shampoo.  I don't know.  I'll take pictures of him.  I didn't see the video of the punch.  It came out pretty good.  Is it good?  Okay.  Yeah, not bad.  Is it on the Facebook page?  That thing.  Bam.  That had to hurt so much.  It did, and it still does. 
[02:33:30]  So much.  Go to our Facebook page to see Uriah Faber punch Jimmy.  He punched you hard.  He punched you the hardest, I think.  And I think you mentioned it, or somebody did, how quick.  No, the hardest was Jon Jones.  Harder than Uriah Faber?  Oh, yeah.  Jon hit the hardest.  But the quickness of Uriah Faber's punch was pretty impressive.  Jon's a light heavyweight.  It was, there's a fucking.  Opie and Anthony.  What's our Facebook?  50 pound difference.  Opie and Anthony.  Not Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Yeah, 50 or 50 pound difference.  And Jon, the one Jon threw at my left arm was a fucking hard punch. 
[02:34:00]  What about Uriah's yesterday?  Hard.  Frankie Andrews was hard.  Where did he punch you?  Once in this arm.  Okay, see.  And there's no bruise here.  And that wasn't enough.  He hit me once on this arm and starting to bruise.  But Jon Jones, the bruise was fucking, I had it for a month.  Wow.  He fucking walloped me.  Wow.  But he has a bigger hand, too.  That's a video.  You can just go to our Facebook page. 
[02:34:30]  I tweet it as well.  It's the latest video of Jimmy getting fucking beat up.  Even though I know other guys have done it, like Jason Ellis took a Liddell punch.  I would like to take one from Liddell, and I wish I had done it from, oh, he's taking  a punch and pick it up.  Let me see it.  I have not seen it.  You know what?  I, fast forward to that part.  Go to the, go to the left.  The other one.  That's just the first one.  Second one.  Oh my God.  Look at this.  It's up.  Oh my God.  Watch this.  Oh shit.  Oh.  I don't know, Jimmy.  That's pretty hard.  Oh man, I heard that. 
[02:35:00]  That was a good shot.  That was a.  That's pretty hard.  Shit.  You don't want it to look around the eye when you're making that face?  Oh.  Yeah, he really.  Imagine that in the face.  That's the fucking face.  And that was him.  And that was him.  Fucking face.  Like, that was him being friendly.  Like, he's a nice dude.  Yeah, just being friendly.  He wasn't trying to.  He was just showing me, give me a little.  I would take a shot in the face from him.  Oh yeah.  Amen.  God bad.  We're having fun.  Oh, amen.  God, I'm going to probably knock your teeth out. 
[02:35:30]  Come on.  Oh, no.  Listen, Chip.  You don't understand, Chip.  I think he wants to leave the biggest bruise, so.  Let's see what happens in a couple of days with this bruise.  Yeah.  Now, the biggest bruise.  I like Uriah.  He's a good guy.  He's a very, very nice dude.  He's all right.  I hope he does well with that book.  Yeah, I hope so, too.  But fucking.  I hope it tanks.  Jones was the fucking toughest.  He was the one that hurt the most, by far.  Yeah.  Yeah, man. 
[02:36:00]  Those chokes hurt, too.  But Jones' leg thing was devastating.  Oh, yeah.  That was the number one.  I would.  Yeah.  I forgot about the thigh thing.  Wow.  It was a knee, right?  I still don't get the whole thing.  It was his shin.  His shin to your thigh.  His shin or his knee to my thigh.  His shin to my thigh, yeah.  I wonder if it's just something else in Jimmy that wants him to get hurt.  No.  You like these guys, like, hurting you.  No, but it's not pain that's unbearable at all.  It's just a weird, I've said it before, I have to bore the audience with the same story. 
[02:36:30]  It's something that, as a fan, you watch this stuff, you don't get to experience any  of it.  Yeah.  So it's like, now when I see a leg kick, I really know.  I took one on a mild level.  I don't just watch that as a thing.  Oh, okay.  It gives you a greater appreciation of a fight.  The fact that guys take that and continue fighting, I almost, he fucking shin me a little.  That's also why he watches gay porn.  I almost threw up.  Yeah.  But it's like, you get an appreciation for it.  You get a greater appreciation for eight inches up your ass. 
[02:37:00]  You know, let me tell you, guys, that really hurts.  See what he's doing on the...  I get it.  I get it, guys.  I get it now.  No, no.  I just, I think it's fun to do it.  It's like, you get to...  How many people get to take a fucking punch from a fucking UFC champion?  And he's not trying to hurt...  How many people want to, though?  It's fun.  Yeah?  Yes.  I don't know.  I think a lot of people would do what Jimmy's doing.  I totally agree.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I agree with Jimmy.  I don't think I'm unique with that.  I think a lot of people would.  I'm a fucking wimp.  Every time I get close, and you even asked yesterday, and I was like, no. 
[02:37:30]  No.  If I didn't think...  I gotta do it one time.  Did you have to?  You have to.  I wouldn't have to.  You have to arm or something.  I wouldn't let Brock punch me full power.  I wouldn't let Couture hit me full power.  But I would let them hit me fucking...  Like, the Jones hit me 60% or 70%.  That hurt.  And Uriah Faber yesterday, 50%?  Yeah.  That looked way more than 50%.  It looked like he went...  That was a short arm.  He didn't...  That was a short arm.  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't cock back.  If he really...  Dude, cock back, put his body into it.  Like, Roy Nelson threw a punch in one of these fucking things.  He knocked out who he was fighting. 
[02:38:00]  It was an overhand...  The fat guy that annoyed you?  Yeah, yeah.  He threw a fucking...  Like, a bolo punch, roundhouse, overhand, right.  What do you mean the guy that annoyed you?  Because he's so out of shape.  Yeah.  He's in terrible shape.  He looks like a big hillbilly.  Oh, oh, okay.  He's a heavyweight.  Who's this guy?  He doesn't belong in here.  But like that...  I would never let him do that to me.  Yeah.  Because that's fucking...  You know, you'd break your arm.  Yeah.  I'm not an idiot.  Well, you know...  That has to hurt, though.  I can't wait until the bruises really badly.  Yeah, me neither. 
[02:38:30]  It looks...  It really looks cool.  You've had the one with the...  That bruise that you got from the...  What was it?  A kick?  Or was it a punch?  No.  Rashad bruised both arms, and Jones did the left one.  That one fucking...  Jones, he hit me...  Because he has a big fucking light heavyweight fist.  Well, that left a nice fucking mark.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Are you scared it'll hurt you like forever?  Yeah, like break an arm or something.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  No.  The only one that scared me was the leg thing, because then you're...  I was in Pennsylvania.  Then you're fucking...  I got into bed a certain way, because I had been favoring it. 
[02:39:00]  My fucking knee hurt.  I had to wear a knee brace.  Oh, my God.  With a geriatric mask.  And the chokes scare me a little bit.  I won't do chokes anymore.  Why?  Because my voice is my fucking living, and it's like a couple times...  I had a sore throat for about a week after Jones choked me, and after Couture...  And Velasquez put me in a fucking choke.  The punches are just kind of...  They're a little sore.  But the fucking chokes are a little scarier.  Brock's fucking knee thing hurt, too.  What if you get like a blood clot or something from it?  Come on.  Oh, jeez.  Fucking hell. 
[02:39:30]  These guys fight.  I hope your affairs are sorted out.  I'll take care of it.  Your affairs.  I'll be in charge.  Yes.  Yeah.  Wow, that's...  Getting hit is not the...  The part of fighting that's scary is not being hit.  It's being embarrassed by losing.  Really?  Yeah.  It's not the physical pain of being punched.  I'm scared of being hit.  No, but that's a survivable thing.  It's something about the ego of losing and being humiliated.  I know.  I don't want to get hit.  I hate the thought of getting punched in the head.  It's not pleasant, but I mean, that's not the scary part.  Keith and I sparred for the first time two days ago at the boxing gym. 
[02:40:00]  Yep.  And when he started to really come at me, I started laughing.  And I think it's because I was...  Oh, his nervous laughter?  Yeah, I could not stop laughing.  Oh, wow.  You know, like first, it was just...  We were just going at each other, but then once I lost control, I just couldn't stop laughing.  And I think it's because just I was afraid of being humiliated.  So it's just so awful.  Keith is a dumb guy who won't know that you're just sparring like...  A dumb guy.  I know.  He goes like full throttle for my face. 
[02:40:30]  He'll just wind up and fucking belt you, yeah?  Is he good?  Keith?  Yeah.  I love him.  I think Keith is more of a wrestler than a boxer.  He's probably a street fighter.  We're both getting better, yeah.  I think in the heat of the moment, Keith could do some damage.  I'm sure he could get some stuff done.  But boxing is like a different...  Yeah.  You know, like neither of us have the skills yet.  How's Will?  You don't have the skill set?  Will is good.  Very quick, right?  Yeah.  He like only eats steamed vegetables.  It's like, I don't...  Why do you get out of bed in the morning?  Oh, man. 
[02:41:00]  He eats fish.  He eats fish.  He does?  Who's this?  Will Sylvain.  He was...  You know, it was Patrice's room.  He spoke at the way...  Oh, Will.  Yeah, I know Will.  Yeah, black guy's...  He's a good man.  He's a perfect physical shape now from boxing.  He is.  And steamed vegetables, apparently.  Zero fat.  Steamed vegetables suck.  I like a good steamed vegetable.  A good steamed carrot.  Oh, horrible.  I'll juice that shit, but I don't know if I got to see.  Yeah, juicing is good.  Juice that shit, bro.  Yeah, you gots to juice that shit.  Yeah, holla.  I don't know.  That's some great discipline, though, to be able to do that. 
[02:41:30]  Because you will end up in great shape.  Yeah.  Not fucking fat.  Yeah.  How good is the workout?  45 minutes?  It's an hour.  That's a...  You got to be sweating like a pig.  Sometimes a little longer.  Oh, no.  You sweat from the time you're in there until you leave.  Yeah.  You get dripping.  Is your taint sweat?  Oh, my taint is, like, fucking sopping.  Yeah.  I wear a little headband on my taint.  Yeah.  She has a notoriously wet taint, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a sponge cake.  Yeah.  I put those nasal strips on my taint just to slow it.  Just to soak up some of the sweat. 
[02:42:00]  It doesn't work.  It's not the sweat that's the problem.  It's the smell.  Everybody gets upset.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody's in a sponge.  Yeah.  So what do you do?  What is the workout?  You do some jump ropes, some heavy bags, some push-ups?  It's always different, but, like, some days we only box.  He'll be like, you're going to throw 2,000 punches today.  Or he'll, you know, he'll do, like, sort of circuit training and strength training.  Do you have gloves?  No.  I just bring my own wraps.  Is there a lot of people there?  There's probably 20 people there.  In his class?  Hmm?  In his class? 
[02:42:30]  Whose class is it?  No, it's not a class.  We just work with a trainer.  What gym are you at?  I'm a boxing trainer.  The famous one?  Downtown.  It's, uh, Lou used to go there.  Broadway, Bleaker.  Yeah, I think that's the famous one where we just feature that crazy training guy.  Really?  Oh, right, yeah.  There's a video of a guy.  Gleason's is famous.  And the one on church?  I think it's church.  Yeah, no, that's a different one.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that one's famous.  That guy is crazy.  Where's Ralph Macchio?  He's late.  Oh, no.  Roland is, uh, actually, he's not late.  It's like, Roland just made the karate kid move. 
[02:43:00]  He just did the crane move.  How sick is Ralph Macchio of the crane move in his face?  Oh, he's gotta be so sick of it.  You know when he's walking down the street, people must do that.  Hey, Daniel-san.  Wax him, wax him.  Oh, God, enough, you motherfucker.  Why don't we spend the whole interview just going, do it, do it, do it.  Come on, do it, do it.  Come on, do the crane.  Come on.  Can we get a picture?  Could you do the crane?  I'll be Johnny.  He'll be Mr. Miyagi.  Yeah.  Oh, I want to be the bad guy, fucking Cobra Kai-sensei. 
[02:43:30]  I want to be Johnny.  Do it.  Oh, you want to be Johnny?  Yeah, you're blonde.  You can be Johnny.  I'm Johnny.  Yeah.  And Daniel can be the guy that goes, yeah, get the body back.  And what happened with the new version of that movie?  Did well?  I don't know.  With Will Smith's kid?  Will Smith's kid.  Yeah, did it do all right?  I think it did do well.  I didn't see it.  I think it'll do a sequel.  I hope so.  Was it that good?  With the same girl.  The same Asian girl, but she's 38 now.  She was beautiful, wasn't she?  In part two?  You liked her.  Fuck yeah, I had a big crush on her, man. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, did you?  Yes.  I'm not into Asian girls.  It's not a fetish to me, but she was what?  It did well.  Okay.  How much?  A couple hundred mil?  Yeah, it did.  It's scraping 200 million.  I think he's coming now.  That's a huge hit.  He's coming right now, Sal?  Oh, yeah.  There he is.  There's Ralph Macchio.  There he is.  A guy who said he would never do our show, but here he is.  He did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's a different type of thing.  You know.  Hey, Ralph.  Hey, there.  Oh, dude.  No, no, no.  Don't do that.  You're an idiot. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm embarrassed.  How are you, man?  How are you doing?  Hey, Ralph.  Good?  I'm good.  Take a seat.  I met you at a Jets game.  That's right.  It was you.  And I do have to say, you said you would never do our show.  Did I say I would never do it?  Yeah.  No, I don't think I said I would never do it.  I thought that was Stern.  No, no.  That was you.  Oh, we talked about that a little bit, too.  We're on the air.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we just.  That's Amy Schumer to your right.  A very funny comic.  How are you?  The lovely and talented.  O.P. Anthony and Jim Norton to your left there.  Hey, Jim.  How are you?  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you doing, man?  Hey, man.  Good.  Good to see you guys.  Good. 
[02:45:00]  The Long Island guy, right?  Long Island guy is actually it.  Yes.  Where abouts?  I grew up in Dix Hills.  Oh, yeah.  Huntington area.  Yeah, that's where I was.  Huntington.  Huntington?  Centerport.  Centerport.  And we have a place not far from Port Jeff.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  And then we go to Montauk.  That's the house the 80s built.  I was back.  I was back.  I was kind of by the same area, like Huntington, Dix Hills area.  It was like by, remember Fred's Diner?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was right behind there. 
[02:45:30]  There's a little street that's back there.  That's exactly where I am.  That's where I was born and raised.  Long Island trash.  Long Island.  That's right.  That's right.  And you never really left Long Island with all the succession.  No, I've always, I always home base.  Kept your roots?  Yeah, it just, I've always kept sort of one foot in and one foot out.  I think that's sort of lends itself to me not going insane or down all those dark roads.  Yeah, yeah.  So, we're looking to do that now.  Never got to Hollywood?  Never got, I don't know about that. 
[02:46:00]  What are you the sickest talking about?  Like, what are you the most disgusted to have?  No, I'm saying, but as they bring up certain, like, what is the most of the thing that you're  like, I'm right already with this?  Um, um, you know, would you do the crane in the studio?  Exactly.  What was it saying?  We said that had to be the number one thing that's gotten so fucking annoying.  No, no, but the thing is, no, it's like, will you do the crane?  Because that's one thing I don't, like, I consider it sort of sacred-esque to me and  a piece of, uh, of the legacy of, I know legacy is a big word, but, uh, it is, that 
[02:46:30]  is, um, uh, an image in a movie.  You probably go anywhere on the planet and everybody knows what it is, at least still.  Yeah.  Uh, but, but the, um, and I only did it once since I did the movie and that was in my own  wax on, fuck off video.  Oh, right.  Funny or die.  Funny or die.  Which was a great video.  Oh, they've asked you to do it many times and you've said no, right?  Oh, they all do it.  I mean, I did Dancing with the Stars day one.  They're like, you're going to do the crane, right?  I said, you haven't earned, you haven't earned the crane yet, dude.  So, so that's the, but I, you know, as I get older, I consider it a privilege. 
[02:47:00]  I don't look at it as like, oh, you know, but, but like, come on, man.  And I just, you can do it.  I'll stand there.  I'll watch you do it.  And I critique them and how bad they suck at it.  We nailed it.  We nailed it.  Who is the, uh, the really hot Asian girl from part, we were just talking about her  from part two.  She was beautiful.  Right.  She was a beautiful girl.  Her name is, uh, Tamlin Tamida.  Is she, uh, did she keep acting?  A lot of times they go overseas and keep acting.  I never saw her again.  She was in, um, uh, working now as a publicist, uh, she was in, uh, uh, the Joy Luck Club, 
[02:47:30]  which I think was a legitimate movie and some, uh, um, a bunch of films, you know, but, uh,  that one just comes to mind as, uh, as one of the bigger ones since then.  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy liked her a lot.  I'm a big, up the Academy fan though.  I go way back.  Up the Chooch Bambalazzi, right?  Yeah.  Who else is in that besides Ron Lieben?  And I can't place the rest of the cast, but I watched that movie 500 times.  Good, good, good.  Barbara Bach.  Oh, man.  Um, you guys are testing me.  This is fun.  No. 
[02:48:00]  Well, it was directed by Downey Sr. and Downey Jr., Robert Downey Jr. was in the movie.  He was like 13 and a half.  Holy shit.  Just turned 14.  Who was he in the movie?  He was like, you know, third soccer player from the left.  Oh, okay.  Kind of guy.  But, uh, but he was there all the time and, and with his, his dad.  And it was, it was a crazy, uh, that was my first job.  Yeah.  Chooch, Rodney Verbergard, uh, Verbergard.  I fucking forget the name of the, uh, it was, it was the, uh, I forget the name of 
[02:48:30]  the Academy.  I know Mad Magazine did it.  It was Weinberg Academy.  Weinberg, yes.  Imagine a military academy going, Weinberg, yeah.  That was the whole job.  It was written by, uh, these two guys, Tom Patchett, Jay Tarsis, who were, uh, like, uh, you  know, um, Newhart writers, like back in the, they were sitcom writers.  Yeah.  But it was, um, God, and Hutch Parker was in that movie who wound up running 20th Century  Fox for a while.  He's Parker Stevenson's kid brother.  Um, if you know, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a wealth of, uh, pop culture. 
[02:49:00]  You really know.  Yeah.  It's all I want to talk about is up the, every time Ron Liebman walked in the room, it would  get cold.  Yeah, that's right.  And there was the black guy.  I feel it.  Is it, was it Washington?  Antonio Vargas from, uh, he was Huggy Bear.  Huggy Bear, yeah.  Oh, is that who that was?  That's right.  Oh, okay.  Huggy Bear from Starship.  What shit with big tits?  1980.  1980.  Yeah.  This is 1980.  I just, I've seen it here about 32 years ago.  How'd you get, how'd you get that one?  How'd you audition and everything?  I auditioned and we got the part and I just, you know, I didn't know, you know, I did a  couple of commercials and just out of the gate. 
[02:49:30]  What commercials?  Cause I remember like every fucking commercial when I was growing up.  Hubba Bubba.  Yeah.  That's right.  You guys got us.  Hubba Bubba.  I just remember.  Crack research.  No.  It was, it was actually Bubble Yum.  Oh, Bubble Yum.  The competition for Hubba Bubba.  That's true.  I apologize.  And they said there were spider eggs in there.  Right.  First, remember that?  That rumor.  That whole thing.  They needed people to stop chewing spider eggs in it, man.  It's doing too well.  What'd you do in the commercial?  I sang and danced. 
[02:50:00]  It was, here's the jingle.  I think I remember it.  And you can probably pull it up online.  It's, oh God, how does it go?  The number yum taste in bubble gum that tastes so fine.  The famous flavor lasts a long, long time.  It's a taste of the yum.  The number yum taste in bubble gum.  You know, it's like we were working in a bubble gum factory.  I remember that.  Instead of number one, they said number yum.  Number yum.  Did you correct them and tell them there's a misprint?  This is supposed to be one.  This is wrong.  I just know, I know now there were 50 executives in the room figuring out that jingle. 
[02:50:30]  And it was like, it was Saturday morning cartoon stuff.  Do you look back on stuff and like, a lot of people look back on stuff and get not embarrassed  by it because there's some very, very famous stuff there.  But like, when you look back, you're like, ah, like I hate looking at older footage of  myself.  Do you like it or do you kind of try to avoid it?  Um, uh, some older footage is kind of, you know, it's tough to look at.  I mean, my kids just remind me how much more hair I had or how much better looking I was, 
[02:51:00]  you know, and it's constantly a reminder.  Hey dad, look at this one.  You had, you know, more hair and you didn't have to work with it.  Yeah.  No, I got a decent amount of hair, but I had a sick, I had a sick abundant hair.  Yeah.  And, uh, and just, um, you know, your voice seemed deeper back then, which is, which  your voice, you actually sound younger now than you did back then.  Well, that's it.  I am doing the Benjamin Button thing.  I figure why age, it's so unpopular.  How old are the kids?  Uh, my daughter is 20, believe that. 
[02:51:30]  You got a 20 year old?  It's sick and my son is 16.  I got two sophomores.  It's weird.  I'm weird.  I'm a man child freak, but we just, we just move on.  I mean, considering the alternative, we'll take it, I guess.  Oh yeah.  Right.  Wow.  So what are you working on now?  Yeah.  I know TV land is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tomorrow night on, uh, uh, Wednesday, June 6th, uh, uh, 1030 on TV land, happily divorced.  It's Fran Drescher's show.  Really funny.  Uh, I play, uh, her love interest and is caught in a cliffhanger triangle and then we're going  to do some more episodes next season. 
[02:52:00]  So that was, that's a lot of fun and people should check it out.  And I just did a film with, uh, called Hitchcock with Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.  Oh wow.  It was a great get for me and Scarlett Johansson's in it.  Tony Collette and Jessica Biel and me.  Wow.  I mean, I don't have a, uh, it's not a huge, uh, uh, starring part, but it's just a great  gig to be involved with.  I play the guy who wrote, uh, Psycho, the original screenplay to Psycho.  So finish that up and I'm heading off to do a lifetime movie for a Christmas movie, you 
[02:52:30]  know, keep all the family people happy.  Nice.  It's Ralphie doesn't, and then I have, uh, and then I'll be done after this one.  Lifetime movie.  Do you play some guy that seems really nice at first and then he's like, start beating  the woman at some point?  I wish we had that plot twist in it.  Love those lifetime movies.  Yeah.  It starts out nice.  The girl's friend always, I kind of realized like, Hey, I don't think he's, Oh, shut up.  You're just jealous.  And then before you know it, she shows up wearing sunglasses everywhere.  It's like, what happened? 
[02:53:00]  Well, you know, he was tired.  I knew he was tired.  Yeah, right, right.  So, um, uh, so that's, uh, yeah, I'm heading to Vancouver tomorrow for that.  And then I have a show, uh, that I'm producing called American Gypsies coming in National  Geographic on July 17th.  It's a docu-series about this prominent gypsy family in New York City and their subculture.  It's so fascinating.  I never knew there was like this whole gypsy thing going on.  And I know, uh, like I saw a few shows that there's, that other gypsy show that's on  it.  Yeah, yeah.  Gypsy wedding.  Yeah, this is different than that.  And you watch that and go, but it kind of gives you a little line on what's going on 
[02:53:30]  in that gypsy world.  Right.  You're like, what the fuck?  Who didn't notice this shit was going on?  I know.  And it's right down there.  I mean, it's like 57th Street.  It's downtown.  It's like the psychic shops.  And it's real.  I saw the footage of this family and it just, and they have their own court system and their  own, you know, they, yeah.  Oh yeah.  And then, you know, they have the elders make the decisions.  They don't bring law enforcement in and they make, and they, they're homeschooled.  Put a curse on you.  It's weird.  Dude, uh, I died with it on my lips.  So it's really, it's really a cool, uh, a cool show. 
[02:54:00]  So that launches on July 17th.  So, yeah.  Hey, did you have scenes with Hopkins and Helen Mirren?  I had scenes with Hopkins and, uh, Tony Collette.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  And he was all in the, uh, one thing I will say, a story, a quick story about Anthony Hopkins.  We were in, he's in the fats, you know, he's playing Hitchcock, so he's in the makeup and  the prosthetics and the fat suit and we're in, you know, he's in his mid seventies and  we're an hour 12 on this day, just starting the big scene that I have with him.  Uh, cause he's obviously has to be in makeup for X amount of time. 
[02:54:30]  And we, we shot the whole season, the first day shooting with it.  And, uh, and you know, the producers wanted to send him home to do my coverage, you know,  to do the closeups, which is not uncustomary, but never preferred.  And he refused to leave when it was time for my closeups, you know, he said, this is  our scene and we, you know, I would never take myself out of our scene.  We need, we need to react.  It would be great if he said, no, no, I need you to leave.  Yeah.  That's what I should have done.  You're bumming me out, man.  You're bringing me down. 
[02:55:00]  Tony, Tony, Tony.  You're bringing me down.  How funny would that be?  That, that, that, that's fucking hilarious.  That would be hilarious.  That's why I need you with me.  But guys that are that amazing are usually really nice guy.  Everyone says a guy like that is just a sweet guy and fun to like, you know, a guy as great  as he is could be a pompous asshole.  Sure.  And you, you know, you hear so many of the other stories.  So that's why I wanted to tell that story.  Cause, uh, yeah, great guy.  Do you find yourself, I mean, you, again, you're a pretty, you've been to some legendary  movie.  I mean, the fucking outsiders, you've worked with some amazing people.  Yeah, that was a cool movie.  Do you, do you still get intimidated working with a guy like that or, or, or? 
[02:55:30]  Uh, yeah.  A fun first meeting, you know, you're still, you know, he's legendary.  And, and one of the greatest actors of our time, certainly arguably.  So it was, you know, wow.  Yeah.  I gotta, you know, I gotta make sure I'm, I'm here.  And, uh, but he, you know, it was very easy to work with.  I think it's tougher and you become more intimidated when they intimidate you.  And he did not in any way, it was, it was all a big embrace and support, which is, you  know, a credit. 
[02:56:00]  Did you flub any lines or no?  I did flub a few.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to hum and a hum and a hum and a hum.  You know, but it's all good.  He didn't give you any hard times or anything?  Yeah.  No, he didn't try to eat my face off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's probably what he's sick of.  He's, Hopkins is probably sick of that.  That would be his number one.  I'm sure.  That's gotta be his number one.  But he got some fava beans and a nice key.  Yeah, we get it.  But he knows you too, Ralph.  Yes, absolutely.  No, he was very, he was on that.  You're a big star yourself.  He was on that.  He was, you know, he was, he was very respectful. 
[02:56:30]  It was very cool.  It would have been cool if he asked you to do the crane.  Then you'd have been like, all right, what do I do?  All right, you know what?  And I would say, as long as you put that, like, that mask thing on.  That's what it is.  He hasn't run into the right people.  That's right.  There are people that ask you to do it.  You're definitely doing it.  I'm screwed.  It ain't you guys.  Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll take that.  That's just cool.  Definitely, definitely.  How did you, that's funny.  You think we're still pushing it? 
[02:57:00]  That's today.  How did you avoid, because a lot of people, when they start acting as young as you did,  get pretty fucked up.  Right.  I mean, what kept you away from that?  Um, well, one of the things is I wasn't as young as I always look, you know, people think  that I was, I started when I was 12.  I just looked 12 when I was 25.  Okay.  I played 16 for 47 years.  But, um, um, you know, the, the corny and yet truthful answer to that is I sort of had,  you know, a pretty solid family upbringing.  And I, I, I always, like I said, I live one foot in, one foot out. 
[02:57:30]  But on top of that, I just think I was too, too neurotic and green to go down the dark  path.  And I was like, no, that looks spooky.  Let me go this way.  So that's why I made my video making fun of myself.  After the Karate Kid, how was it with the girls after the Karate Kid?  I mean, whether or not you took them up on it, but there must have been an amazing choice.  There were options.  There were options.  That's a great way of putting it.  There were, there were, uh, there were options.  Did you have a period of time where you kind of went a little bit out of control and then 
[02:58:00]  settled back into being really famous?  For, for me, out of control.  It's like, you know, staying up past midnight.  No, no, it wasn't.  I mean, I think, uh, I never went that far out of control.  I think if I ever did, I probably would have had so much fun.  So I chose, I chose to have fun in a different way.  You know, I wish I had a cooler story, but that's, that's the truth.  That's all good.  That's probably why you didn't get out of control.  Cause you just didn't go down that path.  Yeah.  I just reiterated what he said.  I necessarily, just a nice guy with a good upbringing. 
[02:58:30]  That's right.  A good Long Island upbringing.  What's, what's the worth of that?  Well, I mean, you're still working, you know, you're still, a lot of guys, you know, when  they're really famous, uh, really, you know, kind of younger, they just, they stopped working  after a while.  But, but, well, listen, there was some, there was some lean years there for sure, you know,  and, uh, what'd you do in those lean years?  So I made, uh, babies and we had kids.  Became a family guy for a while.  Became a family guy.  Exactly.  And so that, you know, I get asked that question a lot.  Do you, you know, cause I, I mean, I had that resurgence, not resurgence, but the, I 
[02:59:00]  surge at the beginning.  I sort of paid my dues after success as opposed to paying my dues on the way to it.  You know, I hit right away and it was like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And then, then it sort of started to wane and, you know, you don't know how to get it  back.  And what brought you back?  What was the project?  I think, I don't know if it's one specific thing.  I think it was.  Because it seems very gray.  It seems to me you've always been around.  Yeah, I, I, that is true, but I'd never, you know, it's all cyclical whether you hit those 
[02:59:30]  levels, you know.  So, um, uh, but I think that, uh, I never sort of went away, but, uh, I, there's not  one specific, you know, it wasn't my Pulp Fiction for Travolta, but the truth is he had  the, what, the, the, what's the baby talking, you know, which was a legitimate hit, but that  not necessarily was his big comeback, you know, but Pulp Fiction all of a sudden was, um, so  I didn't necessarily have that, but I guess in, with the nostalgia element that I bring to  the table as, you know, the guy you guys grew up with kind of thing, um, you give a 
[03:00:00]  little credit to the, the dancing with the stars machine that does put you out there  to 20 something million people every week.  And the fact that I didn't suck at it and, uh, and try to represent myself well, I think  is, you know, you like that experience.  I, uh, I, this stuff I liked about it, this stuff I did not like about it, but it was,  I will say this much.  It was a great thing at the time.  I think the, the Funny or Die video and then the remake of the Karate Kid made me say, this 
[03:00:30]  is the time to do this.  And even though I swore I would never do that show and it turned out to be a, a, a positive  thing.  I mean, the, the performance element of the show, I loved it.  The, uh, the competition element of the show, you just feel the machine.  Oh, really?  You know, it's, it's, uh, and it's, it's hard, but, uh, but the embrace by the country and  people, it was, oh, I was like running for president.  It's unbelievable.  I hear it's a lot of work.  It's a ruthless amount of work.  Anyone under 40 is cheating.  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  It's so much tougher.  I mean, if I, if I, you know, but, uh, it was great and I, I've become very good friends.  The girl I danced with Karina Smirnoff, who, you know, you know, is fantastic and talented,  gorgeous and all these other things.  He's friends with my entire family and that's been one of the best things to come out of it.  Did you, when you said they were lean years, like what, what's the first, like, do you  start to notice, like, did you go, yeah, we called so-and-so, but we didn't need, like,  what, what is the first sign that you're like, ah, this might be.  Well, here's the, for, I'll give it to you the, even before that, which was the first sign 
[03:01:30]  to me, My Cousin Vinny.  Oh, right.  Which was, uh, a movie about two, you know, obviously you know what it's about, but I played  this part of this Italian American guy in college age and, uh, uh, that's moving across  country and gets in trouble and blah, blah, blah.  So you would think that's a slam dunk for a, a shot at the movie.  Um, the studio was not interested in seeing me for it.  My agent couldn't get me in the room.  Wow.  Now, and I knew Pesci not very well, but I had done a play with De Niro and he'd come 
[03:02:00]  a few times.  And so, uh, I wound up running it to him and he didn't have a problem with it, but  there was just, even at that early stage, you could start feeling like I was off the  A, now on the B minus, maybe C plus list for whatever.  Wow.  You start to feel that.  And it's interesting.  That story is cause I, um, uh, when I went into, I finally got an audition, my agent pushed  and pushed and got me in the room for what you would think would be just a, an offer or  at least a meeting and possibly the job, he, uh, I mean, I, I got in there and there 
[03:02:30]  was, they were talking to Will Smith and Ben Stiller cause they, those are the guys that  the studio wanted, like a Jew and a black guy in the South.  It doesn't change the movie at all.  And, and, uh, and I actually read with Will Smith.  Uh, he read the other part, but you know, we went, they went with the Jewish guy and  the Italian guy.  And, uh, I mean my friend and I got the role like seconds later after reading and I  never forget when Will Smith called me to say he was making the remake of the Karate 
[03:03:00]  Kid.  I said, you know, I read with you for my cousin Vinny and I think that was the last time I  ever got the part and you didn't.  That's my long version of the story.  But to answer your question, it started, you started to feel it even then.  Was it, but was it a typecasting though?  Cause you were so famous from something.  That's it.  That does that affect you.  And I think it was a combination of that being, you know, so related to an iconic type of  character and the fact that I was aging it like snails and I was, I was like 30 and 
[03:03:30]  I played like 18 is like, okay, how do, how do we cast this guy?  But now, uh, that seems to be, it works out though because, uh, you must obviously get  recognized everywhere cause you still look very similar to how you did as a kid.  Ish.  Ish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you look very good.  I mean, there, cause there are people that look like, you know, world's different than  they did, you know, so I'll tell them when I see them like, wow, you look a lot older  than I thought you were.  Let them know. 
[03:04:00]  Let them know.  Let them know, right?  Jesus, Jimmy.  But yeah, but I love the fact that you were, you were, you were grounded enough to go in  and read for it.  Like, cause I'm a pompous ass and it's great that you were, cause you did an amazing job  in the movie.  It was, it was frustrating and I bitched all the way in and all the way out.  Now I didn't want to do it.  It was pissed me off that I had a audition for my cousin Vinny, or at least not have  a meeting.  And you must've been thinking like, uh, they're just going to blow this off.  Like they're just doing this as kind of a, yeah, let, let's do this. 
[03:04:30]  So they leave us alone kind of a thing.  Were you that confident going in?  You're like, I want this.  Cause I would be like, fuck it.  They don't want to see me.  I don't want to go.  Yeah.  I think, um, at that point, uh, I just, you know, I just decided to go.  I think of my agent at the time, uh, uh, she just said to me, she said, you have  to go in.  It was a Saturday.  You have to go in.  You have to go in right now and just read, trust me, trust me.  Cause I think she had them, uh, she had them, uh, she was turning them around and  could, because by the time I got back in the car, they called and it was done.  Wow.  You know, that was supposed to be Dyson that movie. 
[03:05:00]  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a three picture deal.  Oh no.  One was for Ford Fairlane and the other one was my cousin Vinny.  And then there was going to be a third one.  Yes.  But that's why, that's why when you look at Pesci and Marissa Tomei, it looks like,  Oh, he's a little older than her.  Uh, and he was amazing.  But that was originally, I believe written for Dice and he got, they got, the studio got  so much pressure, they just fucking paid him off for the three movies and never gave  him the second two.  Wow.  Sounds awesome.  Well, he's going to be in a Woody Allen movie.  Wealth of him.  That would have changed the movie.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Yeah.  But Pesci was amazing.  I mean, you know, he had to do better than Joe Pesci.  But Woody Allen grabbed him for a movie. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Dice is going to be in a Woody Allen movie.  That's right.  I did.  It's Louis C.K.  I just read that.  And Louis.  And Ozzie Davis was supposed to play the brother in Raging Bull.  But Pesci got that.  Yeah, Dice and Louis.  Louis, I could, I'm happy that Dice got it though.  I would love to know what party's doing.  I don't know.  I don't even know what the movie's about.  I don't either.  Louis didn't tell me.  It's a big headline today.  And Woody didn't tell you?  No, Woody.  Woody didn't call and let us know.  Damn it.  Well, no.  I've never met, I have met Woody. 
[03:06:00]  I've never read for him.  Really?  Yeah, I would love to.  I'd bomb.  It'd be a great story.  I'd read for him.  Because we have the same manager, so he introduces.  And you didn't get a picture with Woody Allen?  Of course I did.  And it's signed.  Do we know this?  I didn't see that.  That's a biggie.  I don't think we've seen that.  Jimmy is like, Mr. I need the autograph and picture and stuff from every celebrity.  But if it's somebody, you know.  He's crazy like that.  With some people.  No, with everybody.  I don't bother everybody.  I don't bother.  I just throws a picture down.  There's a picture of Jimmy and Ralph. 
[03:06:30]  Of you and Ralph.  Yeah, you know, Ralph asked and I felt obligated.  Yeah, he's not crazy.  What happened in the airport when we were going to Cleveland, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I was lied to.  Oh, God.  There was a kid sitting down with some gentleman who, yeah, he looked like Nick Jonas.  Kind of.  Kind of looked like Nick Jonas.  I would say kind of.  Yeah.  And I just kept hounding.  I'm like, Jimmy, Nick Jonas over there.  And I said, he looks too young.  That's not Nick Jonas. 
[03:07:00]  Why do you guys all know what Nick Jonas looks like so much?  Can I just ask that question?  He's dreamy.  He's very dreamy.  What's wrong with that, Amy?  And then, like, it just ate at him.  And I knew it would just eat at him.  He had to fucking find out.  All right.  So I did walk over and go.  He walked over.  I did go.  Are you Nick?  And he went, no.  And I was like, oh, mistake.  And I turn around and they're all laughing at me.  So I know what I've been.  Of course.  Sentiment.  But what it was, here's honestly why I did it, because I did Leno once with the Jonas  brothers, with the other guests, and I felt like I never interact with people like that. 
[03:07:30]  Like, I really don't.  Once I'm going to take a quick picture, and I'm like, ugh, I don't fucking talk.  And I'm like, why not be sociable and say hello?  Like, why be a fucking...  Because it's not him?  That's not him.  Daddy, you know, you raise a great point.  And I would love to know what that kid's father thinks I asked him.  I know.  Because it was obviously his father sitting across from him.  He must have thought it was his manager or something.  They're talking business.  You can ask me what I thought.  I'm right here.  What did you think?  It was his manager or business person.  And his father's like some creep is coming up to my kid in an airport. 
[03:08:00]  Do people bother you?  Like, I won't bother people when they're eating.  I'm not an idiot.  Do people bother you when you're with your kids when you're eating for, like, photos?  Not that much.  Occasionally.  You know, occasionally.  You want them to?  We can get the word out.  I don't mean I get the word out.  I think that, yeah, I think that for the most part they know.  And there's only been a handful of times where I say I'm with my kids.  It's when they're, you know, just really forced.  Like, oh, they want me to stand up in a restaurant and take a picture.  Like, if you had to. 
[03:08:30]  That's the one.  Like, wait till hang out outside till I'm on my way out.  And then we'll do one else, you know, in the lobby.  They tell all their friends and stuff.  Yeah.  Rob Macho, what a fucker.  But you must hate the cell phone phone.  Because back, you know, in the 80s and 90s, you'd sign something real quick.  Paparazzi.  But now they all have a phone.  And you see that, you know, through the window.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's just part of the game.  There's nothing you can do.  Well, they hand their awful wife.  She doesn't know how to use it.  Oh, what do I do?  It's back on the text.  What I should start doing is just put the middle finger up constantly. 
[03:09:00]  Just have a bunch of shots.  That's not very nice.  Because I just break up this nice guy thing.  I need help.  I need help.  If they have a regular camera, it's not bad.  They take a picture.  Everyone knows how to hold a camera.  And you don't know if they're shooting video like this guy in the corner right here.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't work here.  Yeah, we don't even know who that guy is.  Somebody let him in.  He does look like a murderer, doesn't he?  Yes, with the glasses.  And he does melt into the wall, though.  Hey, Richard Speck, what are you doing over there?  That's how we actually met him. 
[03:09:30]  I looked up at the urinal and he was there with the camera.  And I'm like, come on in.  Meet people.  Good boy.  But Ralph is promoting.  Yeah, we got to make sure we get the word out for this.  Leave TV Land happily divorced.  It's Fran Dresser's show?  Fran Dresser's show, 1030 Eastern on Wednesday night.  On TV Land.  And it's at Ralph Macchio on Twitter.  Do you tweet a lot?  I do for promotional purposes and touch base here and there.  You tweeted about the no-hitter the other day.  I did.  I do sports stuff.  He's a huge Mets fan. 
[03:10:00]  Mets, Jets.  I'm a Mets fan.  Can you believe?  Mets, Jets, and Islanders, I know, but still, I am.  I'm an Islander.  It's been a good hockey playoffs this year.  Well, the Stanley Cup is a bust.  Well, the Kings are just big and strong.  Yeah, there's no doubt they're going to win the Cup.  Islanders, though.  Wow.  Hey, man, I was there.  I was there.  You remember the big friggin' back in the early 80s.  That's why we're all freaking fans there.  What do you think of the Jets, the Tebow thing?  You guys haven't thought about it?  Oh, man, yeah. 
[03:10:30]  It's exciting.  I think it's going to get ugly at the beginning of the season.  They're going to use both guys.  It's obvious.  He's not going to sit on the sideline with a clipboard.  I wonder what Sanchez feels.  It's got to be such a weird.  Oh, man.  It's embarrassing.  It's tough.  That's why I think the fans are going to be brutal.  The second Sanchez does something, an interception or dropping the fucking thing, they're just  going to start chanting Tebow.  Yeah, but they know that Tebow can't throw or hasn't proven that he could throw enough.  So, I mean, you're cheering for the great white hope kind of thing. 
[03:11:00]  I think that's it, though.  And I'm a fan of both for different reasons, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, I think Sanchez, you know, certainly those first two seasons, he did a phenomenal  job.  And, you know, with the people around him last year, it just, it all got lost.  It got lost.  Because the control of the whole team got lost, and hopefully that gets back on track.  It'll make, you know, for news.  That's for sure.  It's going to be interesting, I think.  I think I'm starting to like the move.  Are you?  Yeah.  It's a headline grab.  That's all it wants.  It's a headline grab. 
[03:11:30]  He'll do the wildcat.  He'll be in a lot of situations.  It'll be fun to see what happens.  I don't know.  And I think Rex Ryan could figure it out.  He's going to have to.  I think he's the type of coach that could figure it out.  The town's about to turn on him if he doesn't.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's right on the cusp of coming from the great one to, you know.  But I'm a fan of the whole thing.  And the Giants, phenomenal how they handled last year, man.  It was unbelievable.  I can't be a Giants fan.  I know.  It's tough.  When the Jets are out, I'm that guy.  I know.  I can't jump teams.  Can't do it.  I know. 
[03:12:00]  I'm just trying to be.  Can't go Rangers ever.  I'm playing Switzerland for your audience.  Can't go Devils.  You know, because I get the pissed off.  I get the, dude, you're a Giants fan.  I'm a Giants fan.  I've been following you.  You've been, you know, you're an inspiration to me now.  I won't watch any of your movies.  No, you've sold me.  And that's all it takes, usually.  Yeah, that's right.  I just like whoever's winning.  You know, like now.  Kings are our team.  That's it.  Yeah, bandwagon jumper.  Yeah.  I was a Ranger fan for like a week.  No week.  That was it.  Yeah.  Then I've had it. 
[03:12:30]  Well, what do you say we wrap up?  We get the hell out of here.  I know Amy's got something coming up that she wants to talk about, Amy.  Sorry, Amy.  I took all your time.  Believe me.  Believe me, Ralph.  We got a lot out of and apparently a lot into Amy.  I'm just sitting over here in a web of regret.  Yes, yes.  Where you can also see me at the Fillmore Filming My Hour special, June 23rd.  I just tweeted the website, the Fillmore in San Fran.  And I'm in Nashville this Thursday. 
[03:13:00]  The Punchline in Atlanta tomorrow and Augusta, Georgia Monday.  And Chicago just for laughs.  Ralph's making me believe he cares.  He's just nodding like, oh, be nice to Amy.  She told us a great story.  Amy's very funny.  She's great.  She really is.  And she was filthy when she was 18.  And now.  And now.  And in between.  And now.  And right now.  And of course, Ralph Maggio.  She's reaching for a hand right now.  Hey, what's your hand doing later?  We don't want to know.  She stole a prop from the Addams family and rode it with her in a fucking taxi. 
[03:13:30]  Finally, when we're signing off, I'm getting to the interesting part of the show.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Well, we don't know where to go with you.  We're trying to be, you know.  He was polite.  No, it was not.  Oh, Amy, we don't know.  I was like, who are you talking to right now?  She just told the cab story.  That's all.  When she was 18.  We all have.  It's not a big deal.  I made a cab driver finger me.  It's not a huge deal.  It's just a good place.  It's just another day at the office.  Hey.  Yeah, yeah.  I also grew up on the orifice.  That's good.  That's right.  Another one.  She grabbed his hand and literally put it on her vagina. 
[03:14:00]  What is the big deal?  He was just driving lefty anyway.  Hot as fuck.  What was he doing with the other hand?  He wasn't a 10 and 2 guy, so I gave him a new time.  He was a one-hander.  He gave him a new time.  That's good.  That's good.  10 and pew.  You're going to use that at all?  That's a good one.  Oh, yeah.  You better.  You better.  10 and pew.  You fucking asshole.  I'm kidding, Amy.  You're not kidding.  I would love to find out.  Oh, God.  I have to whore plug.  Yes.  This Saturday, I'm at the MGM Grand Casino with Artie Lang, David Tell, and Nick DiPaolo. 
[03:14:30]  Tell Artie I said hey.  I will.  I'll see him on Saturday.  Oh, that's right.  You were in Beard League.  Oh, Beard League.  I forgot about that.  Shit.  Shit.  And we're doing, outside of Chicago, August 11th, the Horseshoe Casino, same lineup.  Tickets go on sale this Friday, and of course, Ralph Macchio, season finale of TV Land's  Happily Divorced Friends, Russian show, tomorrow, 1030, on TV Land, and at Ralph Macchio on Twitter.  I'm looking forward to the Hitchcock movie, too.  That's going to be great.  Yeah, that sounds great.  When is that?  I think spring. 
[03:15:00]  Okay.  They just wrap.  They just wrap.  All right, great.  I would love to see it.  But I have, you know, I'm not, if you sneeze or fart, you might miss my best stuff.  But just, you know, keep your eyes open.  Unless they cut me out.  It's about Psycho, and I played the guy who wrote Psycho, so I would imagine I'd get in.  You're in.  Yeah, you've got to be a nice player.  This girl that Johansson played Janet Leigh?  She, uh, yes.  Yes.  And Jessica Biel played Vera Miles, I think.  Right.  Who plays Tony Perkins?  Um, blanking on the actor's name. 
[03:15:30]  Okay.  I'm sure I'm going to need a favor from him soon.  He's going to come back to kick my ass if he's a homeless.  I'll just give you awful guesses.  Yafit Kodo.  No, no, no.  Ozzie Davis.  Ozzie Davis.  There you go.  We'll do a call back to Ozzie.  Hey, Ralph.  You were great, man.  Ralph, much.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You had a great time.  Great time.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks, Amy Schumer.  Thanks, guys.  Also great today.  You're listening to Oviantivity.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. </pre>
