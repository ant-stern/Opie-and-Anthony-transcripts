<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics,  beginning with observations about women shedding winter clothing and transitioning into a discussion of listener-made signs at a WWE Raw event. These signs included one suggesting a phone number for gay sex and another referencing “Opie and Anthony plus Vince McMahon equal three wise men, Ted Turner is a butt plug.”  The hosts heavily promoted their website's newly uploaded content, which included sexually explicit audio clips.  Several listener calls and emails fueled the discussion, particularly concerning their "Whip Him Out Wednesday" segment encouraging the display of "WOW" signs for sightings of scantily clad women.  One caller recounted an early "WOW" sighting, and another described a woman in a card store disrobing after seeing his sign.

The show featured numerous audio clips, including an angry voicemail from a disgruntled listener insulting the hosts and their mothers, and a "Hi, Mom" call where a son confessed to being fired for masturbating at work. Anthony and his brother’s song was also played.  The hosts interspersed listener feedback, both positive and negative, with advertisements for sponsors: MindSpring internet service, Men’s Hair Now hairpieces, and Stacker 2 diet pills.  A concert announcement for Hole at Roseland, facilitated by Ben, described as “Ben the Fag,” a studio guest, was included.  A phone call with Larry Flynt added to the show’s eclectic mix, with Flynt recounting having seen Courtney Love naked.

Later in the broadcast, Opie and Anthony teased the announcement of their upcoming broadcast location for the following day, and requested physical submissions for a design contest instead of digital ones.  A caller accused them of bashing Howard Stern, prompting a defense from the hosts, who clarified that discussion didn’t equate to bashing and that Stern was capable of defending himself.  They jokingly compared Stern's wealth to that of a listener with a significantly lower income.  The hosts further generated excitement for their upcoming "WOW" event, sharing anecdotes about listener involvement, including truck drivers' plans to incorporate "WOW" into their work.  A caller, an audio engineer, discussed his wife's potential participation in the "WOW" event, sparking humorous conversation about her breast size and the hosts' preferences.  Opie concluded the segment by taking credit for many of the show's controversial ideas.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNAW, two for Tuesday, Guns N' Roses, You Could Be Mine, and Paradise City from Appetite for Destruction.  Sophie and Anthony, and why couldn't today be Wednesday?  Yes, what a beautiful day today, huh?  Absolutely beautiful. Still a little disturbed, though, on the drive in.  Why?  Well, a lot of the girls still bundled up today. Did you notice that?  We're one layer away from seeing some stuff. 
[00:00:30]  They're shedding like skin.  Yes, they are.  Yes.  We were really counting on the ride in today because we're like, okay, it's going to happen.  We get to start seeing the hot girls walking down the streets of New York, Manhattan.  Yeah.  But they were bundled up still, man.  Yeah.  Well, you need a few more warmer days.  We're getting there, though.  Yes. Yes, we are.  Isn't that a weird feeling when you start seeing girls half naked again after a long winter?  Yeah.  You feel like you're a kid again.  You're like, oh.  It's just awesome.  It'll happen.  All right. 
[00:01:00]  Well, here we are for another day of stupidity.  Hey.  How you doing?  Now, we got to hunt down the guys with the signs from the wrestling Raw's War last night.  Yes.  Congratulations, you guys.  Great job.  I guess Raw is taped a week in advance.  Yeah, last night's Raw's War was taped last Tuesday at the Nassau Coliseum.  Yeah.  And I was at Anthony's for dinner, and we're sitting there watching Raw's War, and all of a sudden  Anthony goes, right there!  I go, there's one!  There's one! 
[00:01:30]  And I look up, and sure as enough, clear as day, a huge Opie and Anthony 316 sign.  Yeah.  About ten rows up from the ring.  Yeah.  And it was there, the whole first match, pretty prominently displayed.  Yeah.  And then there was another one.  It said, uh, Tuesday Night Hummer Club member.  And there was an arrow facing down at the guy.  You guys rocked.  That was so funny.  You know what the funniest sign was last night, though?  Which one?  The one that said, uh, for gay sex, call.  And there was a phone number.  And you know, it's just some kid with his buddy's phone number on it. 
[00:02:00]  You know, hold it up.  So later on, it'll be like, hey, you dick.  What you doing, man?  I hear people calling my house.  That's classic.  That's great stuff.  Yeah, I wonder who those guys were.  Well, hopefully they'll check in.  Yeah.  Great job.  Because we said we'd give you some prizes.  Yeah, we'll throw you some stuff.  We're doing that.  So we've got to take care of the Opie and Anthony 316 sign.  And Tuesday Night Hummer Club member with the arrow sign.  We saw both of those last night.  Job well done.  Anthony had signed at Raw. 
[00:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Anthony.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Is that my in the air?  Oh, yeah, you're in the air.  Oh, yeah, I was there.  And I had a sign for you.  Which one was yours?  I don't know.  I had kind of crappy seats.  So I don't know if you could have seen it.  Oh, these were pretty close.  They were within five or six rows of ringside.  Yeah, I was at ringside.  Oh, you were?  What did your sign say?  It said Opie and Anthony plus Vince McMahon equal three wise men.  And on the bottom there, it said Ted Turner is a butt plug. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, God, we didn't see that one.  We definitely didn't see that one.  Yeah, I didn't get on TV.  Oh, that would have been the best sign, I think.  It was all right.  I looked.  I didn't see any.  You know what, though?  I believe that you made the sign.  Stay on hold.  We're going to try to hook you up with something.  All right.  Great, guys.  You guys are awesome.  For taking care of us.  You guys are awesome.  Keep it up.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Anthony.  There you have it.  Butt plug.  That's very funny.  All right.  We're just getting started here. 
[00:03:30]  Fax line 212-957-WNEW.  Speaking of butt plug, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  You did a lot of work last night.  I did work in a little bit on the website last night.  I threw some sound clips up there.  A couple of things from Demented World, including the butt plug call and the 100 grand caller.  And a couple of things we've never played on the air.  A woman who is so utterly pissed off at our show,  she called up one of our bosses at our old job and just goes off.  And her language is worse than anything we said on the air ever, ever. 
[00:04:00]  Ever.  It's hysterical.  I think I got that call somewhere.  You should play it.  We would have to bleep it.  Do you have it bleeped?  I think so.  Because this woman is talking about how awful we are and how our mothers must be sluts and whores.  And she just starts cursing like crazy because she had her kids in the car.  And you know with a mouth like hers, she probably curses in front of her kids all the time.  She lost control.  Anthony, I got it.  Do you?  Yeah.  And it's all bleeped?  I think so.  We'll play it.  We'll dump out of it if it's not bleeped.  We're in delay. 
[00:04:30]  So if it's not bleeped, we'll just have to pop out of it.  You'll just hear it end.  All right.  So this was a message left for the old boss?  Yeah.  It was on his voicemail.  All right.  She starts out trying to be all calm.  It's hysterical.  She loses it.  Now, you have the unedited version of this on the website.  Yes.  With all the curses?  Yes.  Okay, cool.  A message from February 10 at 6.57 p.m.  Hello, Glenn.  I'm sorry to do this to you.  Please forward this on to your general manager. 
[00:05:00]  I'm wondering if someone's going to wait until someone goes in there and blows the head off  of those pigs that work in your station.  They're disgusting pigs.  Their mothers must be slapped in whores in order for them to go on the air and do the  s*** that they do.  I am very sick of not being able to get in my car and buy oxygen at the son of a bitch's  face and fall into your pigsty's f***ing stoking, and I'm going to have to hear a goddamn  16-year-old girl with a thousand goddamn stoke rooms.  I will kill everyone I'm trying to lose.  Now, if you guys don't stop it, I'm going to turn my f***ing life into the cause of both 
[00:05:30]  of your asses.  Now, please, Glenn, as you can see, I'm upset.  I'm a professional person.  I've got children.  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd.  And you can take your right to speech and shove it up their asses.  You won't stop it, because now you've gotten me very pissed.  Now, please, forward the message.  Thank you.  Wow.  W-A-A-S, your pigsty effing station. 
[00:06:00]  Do you believe her?  I came across that last night.  I had to put it up on the website, unedited, so you hear all of her curses.  That's funny.  Man, she starts off like she's leaving a little voicemail about how angry she is at our show,  and her language is worse than anything we've ever said on the air.  I forgot all about that.  Her kids are in the car.  Her kids are probably in the car when you mouth off like that, you whore.  She can't hear me, but I don't care.  You know what she's talking about?  The bit?  Yeah.  We were playing Hi, Mom, a great game.  We've got to start doing some more Hi, Mom calls. 
[00:06:30]  And this guy called up his mom and announced to the whole world that he got fired from work  because he was caught masturbating at work.  On the job, yeah.  In the stock room.  In the stock room.  So she heard that call, which is...  I can find that.  I have children in the car.  I don't need them to hear about 16-year-olds diddling themselves in the stock rooms.  The call was hysterical.  Now we've got to find that call.  Now we've got to find that one.  And that's what she had a problem with.  Oops.  What else did you put on the website? 
[00:07:00]  I got the Reverend Al song.  A lot of people have been asking about that.  So you could send it to your friends.  The Yoshi thing.  What else did I put up on there?  Oh, you put that orgasm chick.  Yeah, yeah.  We had a girl call up, and she was watching a porno movie, and she was pleasuring herself.  And she did it for us on the air.  And we couldn't even put this on the air, because it was real.  Yeah, too graphic.  She was really doing this.  At one point, she puts the phone somewhere else besides her mouth, and you hear it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  And then she just has a full orgasm.  Yeah.  It's incredible audio.  Yeah.  I defy any guy to listen to it, not sport.  I swear to God.  So that's on the side as well.  Yeah.  We'll be popping more stuff on there, too, now that I'm back in the swing.  Yeah, and then you've got the F lesson unedited.  Unedited.  You hear the F lesson.  The F word.  Yes.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I love that people have been bitching at me, too.  Hey, man, why don't you design your site better?  You know, my 16-year-old kid could put a better site together.  Look, look. 
[00:08:00]  It's not about bells, whistles, and cute little graphics on my front page.  It's just about content.  Of course.  There's links, and there's little text that tells you what the links are.  That's all you're going to get.  That's all you need.  That's it.  You don't want to go through all the pretty stuff.  Yeah, what do you want?  You want to get to the heart of the matter there.  Download a virtual reality 360 view of the studio for 10 minutes before you get to the good stuff.  Shut up.  All right.  We got a lot to do today, obviously.  Overnight, we got so many requests for the Yoshi song. 
[00:08:30]  Hey.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with the Rolling Stones.  Give me shelter and shattered.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  And Anthony, John doesn't like us.  What happened?  John Torres of New York.  Why don't you play more music and talk less because you aren't that funny.  Just let the music ride and you don't.  Ouch.  John at doorlit at AOL.com.  Ow.  That hurts, John.  So John at doorlit at AOL.com. 
[00:09:00]  He doesn't like us, Anthony.  What a shame.  Doorlit?  Doorlit, I think.  Like D-U-R-A-L-I-T.  Yeah, I believe it.  At AOL.com.  At AOL.com.  Doesn't like us.  Doesn't like us at all.  He's going to be really bummed when we go all talk on our show, isn't he?  All right, look.  I just want to say to everybody, doorlit, D-U-R-A-L-I-T at AOL.com.  We don't want anything bad to happen to his email.  Right.  No email bombs.  Don't go doing stuff like that. 
[00:09:30]  Don't send him the Melissa virus.  We don't condone that.  No, that's really, that wouldn't be too cool.  Because I know there's plenty of guys that listen, little hackers, that have a lot of  those little programs that could really pack out email boxes and do things.  Yeah.  So don't.  So just leave doorlit at AOL.com alone.  Right.  He's entitled to his opinion, obviously.  Yes.  You know.  Exactly.  And John, you know, Ant and I have been through the ringer for the last five years.  If you're going to try to get to us because that's what you're trying to do, come up with 
[00:10:00]  something better than that.  Yeah.  Please.  That means nothing to us.  Oh, you got us.  Oh, ouch.  Okay, we better play twofers all afternoon.  Shut up.  Yeah.  He wants to hear some twofers.  The guy doesn't understand what we've been through and he thinks a little note like that  is going to get to us.  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  I'm trying to find this great email from this lady.  Tomorrow is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  And by the looks of the email and the phone calls and the faxes, it looks like tomorrow is 
[00:10:30]  going to be an absolute freak show on the roadways.  It seems like everyone is getting a wow sign for tomorrow in hopes to seeing some boobage.  Yeah.  Which is very, very cool.  And it's kind of like fishing, you know?  Well, because you're not guaranteed to catch the big whopper tomorrow.  Exactly.  You just got to keep at it and be patient and enjoy the sightings of other people that will  call in and brag about what they've seen on the highways on Whip Him Out Wednesday. 
[00:11:00]  And then maybe next week you'll be the lucky guy.  You never know when it's going to happen.  And that's what's so cool about the Whip Him Out Wednesday phenomenon.  Yeah.  You never know.  All you have to do is be driving on the road.  Yeah.  To participate.  And it doesn't matter, rain or shine, it'll happen tomorrow.  We'll just have to lower the boob sighting index if it's raining tomorrow.  It just goes down, which means, it just means your sign's got to be a little bigger.  Yeah.  And brighter.  Like the sunburn.  You know, the sunburn index out of two because it's, you know, cloudy and rainy.  Yeah.  If it's a sunny day, you know, the sunburn index goes way up. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  From, oh, she doesn't want me to use her real name.  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  I love your show.  Just one thing.  Remind your other female listeners that some women like to be wowed, too.  I'm a bi woman who has a wow sign on my car when I drive with my husband.  We both like to get wowed.  But I like to get wowed when he is not with me also.  Oh, oh.  Also, do you think you could fix me up?  I'm a very attractive 5'4 blonde with 36 C's.  Wow.  Keep up the good work. 
[00:12:00]  I'll be on the roadways tomorrow.  That sounds nice.  It sure does.  Yeah, we do encourage the ladies to get involved, too.  They like getting wowed.  There you go.  You know?  I think pretty much if you're driving along, ladies, and you see a wow on a car, no matter  if it's an old guy, a young guy, a male, a female, that car wants to be wowed.  That's why the sign's there.  If it's the mayor, it doesn't matter.  I'm going to sneak around.  It's my wow sign on my limousine.  You know, and what we're also going to do tomorrow, we're going to get Earl and Ben on the road. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, they're going to be in the NEW van.  They're going to have wow all over the van.  Wow.  And they're going to have a camera, and they're going to be looking for wows so we can document  some of this on the website.  Yeah, so if you flash the NEW van tomorrow, you just might end up on our website.  So keep that in mind, because we want to bring the excitement to everyone else that doesn't get wowed.  Of course.  It's going to be just nuts tomorrow.  And it goes on all summer, so odds are it'll happen.  We have just begun.  Yep.  All right, we've got to get the Yoshi song on.  A lot of people missed it from yesterday, and there's a lot of people checking in. 
[00:13:00]  They want to hear it again.  God, is this bicyclist that got run over a delivery guy?  Um, I don't know.  I don't know either.  It looks like he's got a basket on his bike, though.  I see the basket.  That's right where the exit for the upper level of the 59th Street Bridge lets out.  Is it?  Yeah, 63rd and 2nd.  Another accident.  This time by a garbage truck.  They just had a huge article, what, in the Daily News yesterday, that the most dangerous vehicle on the roadways is the garbage trucks. 
[00:13:30]  Garbage trucks?  Really?  Not the cabs.  You know, without a doubt, the most dangerous car on the road is those damn livery cabs.  Oh.  Trying to go around the van.  Oh.  It just fell in front of the tires.  Well, nobody did, which a lot of these bikers like to do in New York.  They tap you on the side of the car.  Yeah, to let you know they're coming around.  So the guy is trying to pass the garbage truck.  He's tapping on the side like, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.  He lost his, like, his bike, whatever. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, fell down.  Fell down and got run over.  Ow.  His head got run over.  Oh, stop it.  Did it?  Yeah.  That's how he died.  Oh.  Does anyone have any pictures of that?  Oh, stop.  We wouldn't put that on the website.  Anyway, we've got to play the Yoshi song, Anthony.  Okay.  Anthony and his brother Joe hard at work over the Easter vacation or holiday or whatever.  Mm-hmm.  And now we have a Yoshi song.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday, Pearl Jam, Rearview Mirror from Versus, and Jeremy, too. 
[00:14:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  I found that phone call.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah, so now we've got to go back and explain this again, I guess.  But that's okay.  Yeah.  Anthony put a lot of sound clips on the website last night.  Building it back up to its former glory, Opie.  Trying.  A bunch of people are still having a hard time finding all these clips and JPEGs and GIFs and all that.  All the fun stuff.  It's under the semi-live studio cam of the Opie and Anthony section of the WNEW site. 
[00:15:00]  It's kind of hard to get to.  It's not an easy just click on NEW and you see it there.  Right.  And you kind of click on the air staff and then our pictures and then semi-live studio cam and then you go through a disclaimer.  Right.  And you click on the link after the disclaimer and a separate browser pops up.  Oh, it's very involved.  Lots of goodies there, though.  Sure.  I think we're going to have to change the link from the semi-live studio cam.  Yeah.  Because it's not just the semi-live studio cam anymore. 
[00:15:30]  You know, we have a bunch of companies that want to set up a camera in here.  Mm-hmm.  Where when we're on the air, you know, people can check us out, you know, during the show.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What do you think?  A live cam?  Yeah, why not?  Live cam, I mean, most of the time it'll be really boring because, you know, it's usually just you and I doing our show.  Yeah.  So visually it's kind of boring.  Then there are those times like Friday when it's an exciting thing to check out.  Things going on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  A bunch of companies are emailing us.  Maybe we'll get back to them.  Yeah.  Hop it right up there or something over the door.  Way over there? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  So you get a whole look at the studio.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  All right.  So one of the phone calls Anthony put on the site, we have a lot of unedited calls we've got to put up there, stuff we just couldn't put on the radio.  Well, that's the fun thing about the web, too, is everything on the radio has got to be bleeped out.  The bad words.  Ah.  Not the web.  Mm-hmm.  You get the F word in all its glory.  Exactly.  So a lot of the things you put up there were never on the radio.  No.  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[00:16:30]  So we love playing this game called Hi Mom.  Our favorite of all time was Hi Mom, I'm in porno, which is on our Domeny World CD.  That's brutal.  And then the second favorite for me is Hi Mom, I'm in jail.  Mm-hmm.  Hi Mom, I'm gay was funny.  Hi Mom, I'm gay is very good.  Mm-hmm.  If anyone has any ideas for Hi Mom calls, by the way, you could be a radio star.  Just get a hold of us.  We're willing to do new ones.  We haven't done a new one in a while.  Yeah.  Just get somebody to call up their mom and lie to them.  But one of the ones we did was, Hi Mom, I got fired from work today for masturbating. 
[00:17:00]  On the job, yeah.  On the job.  So let's play that first here.  All right.  And then we can replay the complaint call we got because of this bit.  Yeah.  And then everything will make sense finally.  All right.  Finally.  So check this out.  Hey Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play Hi Mom, I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really gullible.  Hold on the line.  It's ringing, bro. 
[00:17:30]  Good luck.  Thanks.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  Um, can you pick me up from work?  How come I can't hear you?  Can you pick me up from work?  Yeah.  Um, I got fired.  What?  I got fired from work today.  Can you pick me up?  No way.  Please, pick me up.  What the heck happened?  It's kind of embarrassing.  What are you going to tell me?  I was in the stock room and someone walked in on me when I was masturbating. 
[00:18:00]  I got caught masturbating in the stock room.  They're going to have to pick me up.  They're going to give you a warning.  What are you, nuts?  Just come pick me up, will you, Mom?  Chad, you're supposed to do stuff like that in the privacy of your own home.  I know.  It's embarrassing, Mom.  I don't...  So where are you, at a pay phone or something?  No, I'm at work and, you know, I'm here.  Everyone's been looking at me and laughing at me and stuff. 
[00:18:30]  Just come pick me up, will you, please?  All right, all right.  Want me to meet you out back?  Huh?  Want me to meet you out back?  Yeah, just pick me up where you dropped me off this morning.  All right, you okay?  Well, besides my pride, I'm embarrassed.  Just pick me up as soon as you get a chance.  All right.  Thanks.  All right, I'll be there.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God, dude.  What the hell's wrong with you?  How was that?  That was awesome, actually. 
[00:19:00]  You're going to be pissed now.  Wow, I can't believe you said that to your own mother.  My mom's young, you know?  She had me, she was 18, so, you know, she's not cool like that.  The best line was, you're supposed to do that in the privacy of your own home.  Dude, they'll definitely hook you up with tickets.  All right, man.  Hold on the line.  Okay.  And there you have it.  Yeah.  I love that.  I got fired from masturbating.  That's pretty insane.  Can you imagine calling up your mom and saying that?  That's not an easy thing to do.  No, no, I don't think I would have. 
[00:19:30]  So, in Opie and Anthony terms, that's a pretty tame bit, I believe.  Oh, yeah, that's nothing.  But then we had the lunatic lady call and leave a voicemail with one of the bosses.  Very angry.  A message from...  Stu...  February 10 at 6.57 p.m.  Hello, Glenn.  I'm sorry to do this to you.  Please forward this on to your general manager.  I'm wondering if someone's going to wait until someone goes in there and blows the head off of those pigs that work in your station. 
[00:20:00]  They are disgusting pigs.  Their mothers must be sluts and whores in order for them to go on the air and do the s*** that they do.  I am very sick of not being able to get in my car and by oxygen at the son of a bitch's station followed into your pig-sized f***ing f***ing f***ing,  and I have to hear a goddamn 16-year-old fiddle with themselves in goddamn stock rooms.  I have children who I'm trying to raise.  Now, if you guys don't stop it, I'm going to turn my f***ing life into the cause of busting your asses. 
[00:20:30]  Now, please, Glenn.  As you can see, I'm upset.  I'm a professional person.  I've had children.  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd, and you can take your right to speak to shove it up their asses.  You won't stop it, because now you've gotten me very pissed.  Now, please, Glenn, the message.  I'm not a nerd.  I love that.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm a professional person.  I'm not a nerd.  Her whole argument just has no merit to it when she speaks like that. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, she's speaking like a truck driver.  She's, you know, saying that she's trying to raise her children, and my mother is, our mothers are sluts and whores.  I mean, wait a minute.  What are you saying?  Look at your language.  Look at you.  Take your freedom of speech and shove it.  I'm sorry, Missy.  That's written into the Constitution.  I don't think your loud mouth is going to stop it.  All the times my mom got mad at me, she never used language like that.  No.  You can just picture her in the car, you know. 
[00:21:30]  I can't believe these effing guys.  I don't want to go.  Poor kids.  Look at my kids sitting there listening to this S.  So you know what happens?  The kids sneak up in their room, and under their covers, they're listening to our show.  Oh, they're doing heroin to deal with that mother.  Imagine having a mother like her calling a radio station because, oh, she accidentally keeps hitting the station.  That's the best.  When we're on.  No, she's listening, and she's getting titillated, and it upsets her.  Yeah.  She's upset that she actually enjoys it because she's not supposed to.  WNAW New York, Infinity Broadcasting. 
[00:22:00]  All right, Anthony, we've got to welcome back MindSpring to our program.  We love MindSpring.  Does your Internet service sound like this?  Our circuits are busy.  Please try again later.  You're like, oh, man, I want to get on the web.  I want to surf.  I want to check out some pics.  It's annoying as hell.  And you can't even get on.  Annoying as hell.  Oh.  Especially during, like, prime time.  You just can't get on any of those other services.  Do you have those problems with MindSpring?  No.  They have fast, reliable 56K connections.  That's pretty interesting. 
[00:22:30]  You get a 56K modem, and then you can't get a 56K connection.  Yeah, that's always fun.  Great.  Thanks.  Thank you, 288.  Ooh, this file will only take me two hours to download.  Ooh.  So MindSpring has the fast, reliable 56K connections.  They've got free customer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Toll-free, Anthony.

Ah, we had one of the guys from Men's Hair Now come in, a client.  Yeah, we must say, when we heard Men's Hair Now wanting to come aboard, we're like, come 
[00:23:30]  on.  Those hair places, you know.  You can walk around the streets of Manhattan.  You can tell who has the hair pieces and who doesn't.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  The secret is that the people with the good ones, you just don't know.  Yeah.  You think it's just their hair.  And they don't want to advertise it.  Right.  Because it looks so real.  They're like, hey, if people think it's real, why should I tell them that it's not real?  So they brought this guy in to convince us.  And we saw the guy, and we were hooked.  We're like, whoa.  I didn't know why he was here.  Yeah.  I heard, oh, a client is here to meet you. 
[00:24:00]  And I'm talking to the guy, and I didn't know what he was from.  And he had a big, full head of hair, and it looked natural, with a natural hairline.  Mm-hmm.  Wasn't like a big possum on his head.  No, he didn't.  That most bad hair pieces look like.  He didn't have doll head.  No.  Didn't have that either.  It looked natural.  I couldn't tell.  And then we were hooked.  So if you're looking to take care of your situation, I guess we could explain it like that.  If you're a bald guy, it's important.  Appearance is important, no matter what people say.  Mm-hmm.  And if you have no hair, you've got a bald head, people notice. 
[00:24:30]  Girls notice.  Employers notice.  And the Messier cut is just not happening anymore for you.  Right.  Give Men's Hair Now a call at 1-800-HAIR-202.  That's 1-800-HAIR-202.

[00:25:00]  All right.  Another guy that doesn't like us on the SM Feedback?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think he just wants to get email.  Oh, really?  Like he bashed us and then put his real email address up there.  So he probably just wants friends.  Oh.  The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW, 2 for Tuesday, Def Leppard.  We haven't played Def Leppard in a while.  Foolin' and Rocket is so good, Anthony.  Hey.  Their behind the music was one of the better ones on VH1.  Well, you need that tragedy, you know, to make the behind the music interesting to watch. 
[00:25:30]  The Duran Duran one?  That was on over the weekend.  There was a little cocaine?  Yeah.  That was it?  You're a band in the 80s.  Ooh.  Ooh, revelation there.  You might have done a little blow.  Ooh.  Boy.  You know, Sandy, my girlfriend, she did the whole Duran Duran thing where she had, like,  the posters in her room and stuff.  Yeah.  When she found out that the guys were doing coke in the 80s, she was all bummed.  I'm like, Sand, every band did coke in the 80s.  In the 80s?  I think every human being that was living in the 80s did coke. 
[00:26:00]  Did a little bit of a tootage.  Check it out with your buds.  Then you move along.  You go to heroin.  But, yeah, they didn't, I don't know, they didn't have the, you know, the dirt road where  they're showing the car speeding down it to signify there was an accident in black and  white, how they did the recreation.  They didn't show the little swing, swinging empty to show the tragic childhood that they  had.  I love that one.  Yeah.  You made it.  Even as a child, you should, the swing with the music, you know. 
[00:26:30]  Well, you made a great observation when they show that, that desolate highway.  Yeah.  For all the behind the musics.  It's the same road.  Same road.  Yeah.  When Metallica had that horrible accident.  The bus crash.  It was the same.  They used stock footage of the same road for every, behind the music.  Yeah.  The Leif Garrett one, when he had the accident with his buddy in it, it was the same road.  It's like, wow, it must be a dangerous road.  Everyone.  All the rock stars are crashing on that road. 
[00:27:00]  And James Dean drove down that road.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Tuesday with the Dave Matthews Band, Don't Drink the  Water, and so much to say.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thank you for joining us for the ride home today.  Once again, we appreciate that.  Yes, we do.  And, well, I got to mention something really fast here.  Baseball season started, as we all know.  That's right, my game.  And I was listening to, well, the fan, and already the negative Yankee and Mets fans are 
[00:27:30]  coming out of the woodwork.  Because they both lost their first game of the season.  It's one game.  One game.  And they're calling up and just panicking on the fan.  Well, obviously, getting off to a lousy start.  Out of talent.  Look at this.  There's $75 million flops for the Mets.  Yeah, and the post on the front page of the sports section, they're saying $75 million  flops.  $75 million flops. 
[00:28:00]  The Mets, I mean, it's one game.  It's one game.  Well, there's always next year to look forward to.  Obviously, it's going to take a lot of rebuilding.  It's the first game.  First game, and people lose it already.  Oh, get a grip.  We can't give anyone any credit.  No one gets any credit.  How did my Giants do?  See, I hope you Yankee fans are happy.  You're Roger the Rock is Clementine.  They're pretty much saying he's a boss. 
[00:28:30]  It's like...  He's got all that money and he can't even win.  They might as well trade him.  Tomorrow, trade him.  A savvy day for Yankee fans.  Obviously, money not well spent.  Going to be horrible.  Try to rebuild this year.  So maybe in a couple of years, they'll have a team that can be competitive.  Obviously, after game one, it's all over.  Pretty good.  Isn't that right, Mikey?  And the callers are just as bad, though.  Yeah.  They're all just losing it, you know? 
[00:29:00]  What?  What is he showing us?  Roger the Rocket.  Yeah.  First stage for Rocket.  For Rocket.  Okay.  Thanks for interrupting the bit for that.  That was really good.  No, really.  What's next?  Comedy timing is easy to get right back on track.  Thanks for showing us that.  I didn't know we were talking about the Rocket and the Yankees.  Oh, that's right.  We were. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Great.  Let's just continue where we were, I guess.  All right.  Hey, how about it?  No, I see.  You just can't step back into it.  All right.  That's good.  Wait a minute.  Someone wanted to, a bunch of people wanted to hear this.  We were talking about the High Mom games.  And this is a classic.  We haven't played in a long, long time.  And this is just heartbreaking to listen to.  Yeah.  We're starting to do new High Moms.  A bunch of listeners are coming up with ideas for future High Mom calls. 
[00:30:00]  I liked High Mom.  I was molested by Uncle Blank.  It was like fill in the blank.  Any uncle.  That's a good one.  That would really get him rolling.  That's sick.  Could you imagine, like, a daughter calls the mother and starts telling her that, and she's  like, and I was, too, by the same uncle.  The mother admits to it.  I want to do, Hi, Mom, I'm a crack whore.  That's a good one.  Yes.  A crack whore.  Wow.  How would you describe that, though, to your mom on the phone?  Like, what's a crack whore? 
[00:30:30]  Well, I have sex for crack.  Crack.  Oh, okay.  We could try that.  What we've got to do is we've got to get some really good prizes, because then the people  come out of the woodwork to call their moms.  Yes.  They need a little payoff.  They're not going to do it for a CD, but they'll do it for some good concert tickets,  because it gets so stressful.  For example, we'll play this from the archives here from our demented world.  And there you have it.  Did you hear her?  She was, like, crying toward the end of that call.  Yeah.  She was, like, oh, oh.  She was, like.  Picturing her little girl, you know, little perched up. 
[00:31:00]  Getting fouled.  A porn movie.  Getting fouled.  Getting the pile driver move.  Yeah.  Your daughter's a dirty girl.  That is so cruel.  Yeah.  Nasty one.  But we're looking for more people to be cruel to their mom.  Yeah.  Yeah, we want to do a high mom, and that's how it works.  You've got to BS your mom into making her believe that you're doing something very bad.  We got a bunch of calls.  I've got to find them.  I won't find them today.  Of high mom calls that went horribly bad. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  Horribly bad.  Yeah.  Where the mom is just hysterically crying, hanging up.  We can't get a hold of her again.  Very bad.  It's, I mean, just went horribly wrong.  I remember a couple of those.  The high mom, I'm in jail.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  Because the, what, a kilo of coke in the trunk.  Yeah.  Mother started crying.  Oh.  It's just.  And then the guy wouldn't let up on her.  No.  And we finally jumped in, but she had hung up already. 
[00:32:00]  It was too late to stop the train wreck.  It was just so bad.  Sometimes they don't all have funny, happy endings, people.  No.  Just like in real life.  Yeah.  WNEW New York, Infinity Broadcasting.  Oh, oh, oh.  Sorry about that.  Very important.  Very important.  We got to get that ID in there.  That's right.  Every single hour.  Mm-hmm.  The FCC is listening.  Anthony.  Yes.  The auto finance of America.  Yeah.  Opie, picture getting, paying your bills every month.  You're going to pay your car loan.  And it's 20, 30, 40, $50 less than it usually is. 
[00:32:30]  Wouldn't you be happy?  I'd be ecstatic.  You could use that money for things that are fun, not just paying your car loan.  Yeah, I didn't realize that this was even possible to refinance your car loan.  I know you could do it with mortgages and stuff.  But this is a great idea.  We met with these people, and they're like, yeah, man, we could save people a lot of money.  All they have to do is give us a call, and we'll work with them and see what we can do for them.  You ask how?  Interest rates go down.  Mm-hmm.  And they can refinance your loan with a lower rate, and you pay less.  Now, they're talking $30, $40, even $50 a month they could save you. 
[00:33:00]  Mm-hmm.  Give them a call.  It's Auto Finance of America, 1-800-993-1000.  All right, right around the corner, the Mary Poppins song.  Getting way too much email about that.  We'll play it again if you haven't heard it yet.  1027-WNW, The Rock of New York.  Sting me for the Black Crows, and twice as hard before that, it's Ophian Anthony, and  in the studio, Ben the Fag.  What's Ben the Fag doing here?  Well, he rushed down here because Roger wants us to make a concert announcement, Anthony. 
[00:33:30]  Why doesn't Roger come in?  Roger's scared to come in here.  Because we just make fun of his voice and stuff, so he's down understandable.  He sends one of his peeps down here.  Ben's one of his peeps.  Peeps.  All right, learn that from Old Dirty.  What do you got, man?  All right.  Hole at Roseland, May 18th.  Hole.  Hole.  Tickets are on sale Friday at 11 a.m.  Ticketmaster.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Courtney Love, of course.  You remember what Larry Flint said yesterday. 
[00:34:00]  He's got a nice bush.  All right, wait.  I got that.  Hold on.  We got Flint.  That's good for the announcement.  Sure.  Where is that?  Larry Flint.  We talked to him on the phone yesterday.  No crap.  Really dead.  He was on the telephone, and we asked him if we saw Courtney Love naked.  I don't know if this is even it.  Hey, did you ever see Courtney Love naked when you guys were filming that movie?  Is that a yes?  Yeah, I've seen Courtney's first a couple. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Love that.  What would you rate it on a scale of one to ten?  Courtney is for Courtney and Wilde.  Yeah, Wilde.  Wilde.  Yeah.  I bet she showed you some stuff.  Mm-hmm.  She had nice cans in that movie, too.  Did she show you her balloon knot?  Balloon knot.  That's one of the great things about Hustler. 
[00:35:00]  You see balloon knots in Hustler.  They're bent over everything.  Well.  All right, Larry does want to play.  All right, Larry.  Well, Mr. Flint, thanks for checking in today.  Okay, guys.  That's Larry Flint.  Ah, damn.  Ah, ah.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, so we got a hold at Roseland May 9th.  Tickets go on sale Saturday?  May 18th.  Oh, May 18th.  Sorry.  Tickets go on sale Friday.  Friday.  I got all the info wrong.  Wow.  Matt Devote will have tickets rewind tonight. 
[00:35:30]  Okay.  I got an idea for the show, though.  Can we get, like, a special section at Roseland?  For the whole show.  And then we go on the air and we offer listeners a chance to win, a chance to win to get into  Courtney's box.  Like, what?  Like a box.  Yeah, like a box at Roseland.  And we just rope off a section for the whole show.  And then we go on the air and then give listeners a chance to get into Courtney's box.  I like it.  For the show.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  See Courtney's hole.  Live and up close, because you'll be right in her box.  Yeah.  Sure.  Opening for a hole.  Bush.  And tool.  Yeah.  Right on.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Ben the Fag.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  We got to play the Mary Poppins thing from yesterday.  Get it out of the way today.  A little legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  A big story a couple weeks ago, and we were about two weeks too late, because we found  this in the archives and went, oh, man, we should have played it when they were talking  about the pot issue again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's my new favorite song.  Toke it up, Mary.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I was reading an email overnight from a guy who said that he heard that song on the  way home last night.  And then he went home, and his little kid was watching Mary Poppins.  And he walks in the door, and he just fell on the floor.  He's laughing so hard, because he remembered the Mary Poppins song he heard on our show. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  And nobody laughed at more than the song itself, Anthony.  He said he walked into the room just when Ed Wynn was doing his scenes.  Oh, Ed Wynn was in Mary Poppins, don't you know?  That flaming fruit.  You never knew of, you thought of him as a flamer back then when you watched it.  Well, because you were eight, and you were a kid. 
[00:37:30]  You just thought he was like a funny old guy.  Yeah, you didn't know the difference.  And then you tune in years later, and you see this guy, you know, look, we're flying.  Why are the children flying?  Don't you know?  Mary, look, I'll do a headstand.  I'll be your umbrella stand.  Go ahead.  Put it in.  Go ahead.  Put your umbrella in, Mary.  Now open it.  Go ahead.  You can't, huh?  Yeah, tight, huh?  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo. 
[00:38:00]  Don't you know?  What were some of the other movies he was in?  Was he in March of the Wooden Soldiers?  I don't know if he was in that one.  That's an old movie.  Or was he in Toys in Babeland, right?  I think it was Toys in Toyland.  Babes in Toyland.  Toys in Babeland.  Toys in Babeland was the porno version.  I know, that's Toys in Babeland.  I thought he was in that, too, don't you know?  I saw that porno title.  I was in the butt plug scene.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Sorry. 
[00:38:30]  Toys in Babeland.  That's a hot one.  The land of misfit sex toys.  Hoo-hoo.  Yeah, that was him.  He was Charlie in the Box.  Cool.  In person, okay.  A lot of people calling in.

[00:40:00]  Hey, what's up, man?  Who's this?  This is Poirot from New Jersey.  And what happened to you, Paul?  I'm driving 287 going home from work, and I spotted an early sighting, man.  An early Whippin' Mount Wednesday sighting?  You got it.  Hey, how about that?  That's huge.  I can't believe it.  How did it happen?  I'm just driving along.  I happen to have my wow sign on my car a little early.  I figured let me get it on so tomorrow I wouldn't have to worry about it.  And there they were.  They were driving down the road.  I looked over, and boom, she was hanging.  She was actually at the top of the roof of the car. 
[00:40:30]  Honest to God.  I'm telling you, man.  And I'll tell you, there was no cars around.  It was just me and them.  And I'm closing.  I just beat my horn, gave them the thumbs-up sign, and they kept going.  How psyched are you?  I wish I was a truck driver.  I'd be on the road all day tomorrow.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck in the office.  But you got a sighting.  That's cool.  I'm telling you, unbelievable.  You guys are great, man.  I listen to you every day.  Well, congrats on the sighting.  All right, great, man.  Everybody, I'm telling you, if anybody's listening, I'm telling you, put your wow signs up because 
[00:41:00]  it's going to be great.  I'm telling you.  Unbelievable.  You guys are great, man.  It works.  We can't wait for tomorrow.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Keep up the good work, man.  Cool.  All right, bye.  Look at him, the early bird.  You can tell by his voice that he definitely saw something.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Very nice.  I got an email if you want me to read that.  Yeah.  Screw it.  We can talk a little bit here.  This guy over here.  My mouse is screwing up.  There we go.  Tom Lindenhurst. 
[00:41:30]  He goes, you won't believe what happened to me the other day.  I printed a copy of your wow sign and took it into a card store to make copies for my  friends at work.  There was a good-looking girl at the counter.  Sorry, I had to do it.  Can you start over?  Because the music makes it.  Yeah, you won't believe what happened to me the other day.  Okay, good.  I printed a copy of your wow sign and took it to the card store to make copies for my  friends at work.  There was a good-looking girl at the counter.  After I made the copies and went to pay for them, I laid them down on the countertop to 
[00:42:00]  get my money out.  The girl looked down at them and looked around the store.  Then she said, both being Anthony, right?  I said, yep, number one.  Then she said, I'll be the first.  And picked up her shirt over her head right there in the store.  Wow.  Wowed me.  That's why you say, wow.  Yeah.  Why doesn't that ever happen to me?  Oh, it continues.  Oh, sorry.  Then we went into the back of the store. 
[00:42:30]  She said she was just filling in until college started again.  Well, then she took all her clothes off.  You're making that up.  Yeah, of course I am.  Shut up.  That's always how those penthouse forum things start.  Yeah.  Remember reading those?  Penthouse?  And us forum?  I was a guy, you know.  I was in doing some work on the house.  The daughter came downstairs.  Right.  Standing there out of the shower, glistening with soap on it.  It's like, this doesn't happen.  Shut up. 
[00:43:00]  It never happens like that.  No.  Very good.  Heather from Jersey.  Man, you know, we have a ton of people that listen in Jersey.  We love Jersey.  I just want to acknowledge that.  Yeah.  It seems like we hear from New Jersey more than any other area.  More than Manhattan.  More than Westchester.  More than our home area of Long Island.  Yeah.  Heather writes, I just pissed over Stone Mary Poppins.  You sick boys just turned my childhood memories into a new twisted dream of her toking a fatty.  Nice.  How do you think they flew? 
[00:43:30]  Exactly.  She flew with an umbrella.  Figure it out.  Smoking weed.  Smoking weed.  All right.  What do you want to do here?  Do you want to play music?  Yeah, we'll take some calls.  Let's see what people are talking about.  Hi, N.E.W.  How many doobes do you guys think Julie Andrews had a smoke to expose her breasts in Victor  Victoria?  Oh, a lot.  Who wanted to see that?  Yeah, that's true.  But think about that in relation to the female you just got.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:44:00]  She looked, I don't know.  You saw her boobs, obviously.  They look like two fried eggs with, like, gravy stains.  Pancakes with little eraser noses in the middle or some crap like that.  Keep up the good work, guys.  All right, man.  Is Julie Andrews the one that had the surgery and can't sing now?  Is that her?  Yeah, I think so.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yellow.  Hello.  Yeah, are they doing any requests?  Oh, no.  What do you want to hear? 
[00:44:30]  Uh, gerbil song.  This is Jersey.  Tell them.  Oh, you want to hear the gerbil song?  Sure.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got you on the air.  That's one of my favorite songs, don't you know?  The gerbil song.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  It's very close to my heart.  And other places.  Don't you know?  Should I find the gerbil song?  I don't know.  We play it a lot.  Nah.  I don't know.  We'll look for it.  No, you don't want to play that?  Anyone else on the phone?  All right.  No, I like it and all, but I just don't want to drive it into the ground. 
[00:45:00]  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Turn down your radio.  We're on delay.  What do you got?  Hello.  Oh, God.  They don't get it.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, Anthony and Opany.  Hey.  Hey, you guys rock, man.  Let me tell you.  I know.  I'm like a little whacked out of the head right now.  Sorry.  First time I tried calling you guys and I actually got through.  Cool.  I'm from Jersey, bud.  I know.  A lot of you Jersey guys like us, it seems.  You guys are awesome.  And Jersey ladies, so.  You guys are definitely number one in my books.  Keep up the good work, man. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Catch you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Mike Jersey, home of Tony Soprano.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, Opany.  Anthony, how you doing?  What's up, man?  What's up?  I got a hi mom story for you.  You do?  Yeah, I was able to actually pull one off in person.  Okay.  First, I got a question for you, though.  Yeah.  How did your three listeners cast 80,000 votes for the competition against Tara?  Yeah, we just don't have anyone listening to us, you know.  But 80,000 votes, guys.  Yeah, not bad.  We're pretty psyched about that.  Not bad for three listeners.  They must have been busy.  According to Fluff, Fluff, Flully, Baba Booey, we only have three listeners. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  I think we're up to about seven now, so we're pretty proud of that.  All right.  I don't know, boss.  I don't think anybody's listening to them, boss.  I was able to pull a hi mom in person.  You know, the funny thing is, boy Gary ran into Rick, our producer at what, Erotica?  Yeah.  And then he didn't want, he made sure that we didn't mention him on the air.  Right.  He was scared.  He doesn't want people to know that we actually know him or something.  Yeah.  He especially requested, hey, tell those guys not to mention my name on the air, okay? 
[00:46:30]  Don't say Baba Booey on the air.  Of course, my bull will get mad at me.  Oh, brother.  So what's going on, buddy?  I got a hi mom.  Oh, yeah.  This goes back a while ago.  I was about 17.  I had a friend of mine who was an auxiliary police officer.  He brought me home in his uniform and I was cuffed up and everything.  Oh, man.  Tells my mom, I was arrested trying to steal a police car.  And my mom nearly had a heart attack at the front door. 
[00:47:00]  I wasn't able to keep it going long because I really thought I was going to kill her.  It's really not.  But it shows how gullible moms are when their kids are in trouble, you know?  Well, of course.  That whole protection thing comes out, you know?  I don't think it would work on a high dad, you know?  No, not at all.  It'd be a hate for son of a bitch.  It'd be a different story.  Oh, yeah.  Let him rot.  Let him rot.  That's true for the most part.  Yep.  We got to get some more high mom calls on the air.  I want to make a request, too. 
[00:47:30]  I want to hear the Yoshi song again.  Man, we've been pounding that a lot.  All right.  Maybe we'll play it before we get out of here again.  Great.  All right, man.  Great show, guys.  I love you guys.  Hey, thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, Roger has decided to come into the studio.  He must be listening to number four.  Hi, Roger.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Good.  Good.  What's up?  Why didn't you come in with the whole concert announcement?  I'm actually trying to put together your list for your next off-site, and I needed to get 
[00:48:00]  it done before Gary leaves.  Ah.  Our next...  What?  Your next remote.  Our next remote.  He didn't want to say remote.  I said off-site.  Same thing.  I didn't know what the word was.  I didn't know what the word was.  Remote.  Remote.  All right.  Can we tell people where we're going to be broadcasting from, or not yet?  I think tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  All right.  It's going to be pretty cool.  Announce it tomorrow?  Yeah.  From...  All right.  I'll just wait.  Yeah.  So, this is going to be actually a very good time.  Okay.  Sure.  Honestly, really fast, a bunch of people want to send in wow designs. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  Do you have an email address that you don't want to give it out?  I actually don't even know what my corporate address is.  I use my personal one, which I don't have.  No, you don't want to do that.  Oh, no.  So, send it to Scott Colombo.  Oh.  Really?  No.  No.  You know, I'd say the best thing to do is if they have designs, if they could print  it out and overnight it to here, to the station, to my attention, that would be great.  Okay.  It's, you know, Roger, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue. 
[00:49:00]  New York, New York.  10th floor.  Okay.  New York, New York.  All right.  1-0-1-0-6.  Because we're hammering out a design, and we're going to have it hopefully within the next  week or two.  Yeah, we need to have the design by Friday so that we can go into production for it.  All right.  So, I know there's a lot of listeners interested in making something, so.  I was thinking, wow, spelt out with Pop-Tarts.  You'll never live that way down.  My heart's clean.  Anthony, we have a guy on the line that says that we're bashing Stern. 
[00:49:30]  We, when did we bash Stern?  I don't know.  Let's get him on the air.  But look, look what I have to do.  I got to go all the way over the air.  All the way over to the phones.  To click the phones down.  Let's hear this.  We've only been telling the engineers for weeks that the phones need to be right in  front of us.  But let me go all the way over here so I can get this phone call on the air.  All right.  Now, let me get all the way back over here.  What's up, buddy?  I think you guys completed a screen for first.  It's a party.  You've got to do a good stuff, man. 
[00:50:00]  What?  I'm reading.  What?  What?  Hello?  Okay.  That's good.  That's always good.  Get a better phone.  Take the wax out of your ears.  Yeah, like we were bashing Stern.  You know, people don't understand.  You can talk about Howard Stern if you're on the radio.  He's a fixture in the city.  Has been for many years.  And just talking about him doesn't mean you're bashing him. 
[00:50:30]  And I think Howard can defend himself.  He doesn't need his little butt buddies to call in every time we mention him.  We have said in the past, we respect the man greatly.  He's done great things in radio.  You know, what more does anybody want?  Jesus.  Jesus married Joseph.  That guy makes $18,000 a year.  Howard makes about $18 million.  And this guy feels like Howard needs the help.  You know, help.  I've listened to Howard for many, many, many years.  It's one of the reasons I wanted to get into radio. 
[00:51:00]  Obviously.  But Don Stern holds all of the listeners and all of the guests like so many nickels and dimes in his pockets.  Don Stern, you must share the wealth.  You must let us all draw from the wealth.  Can we not wet our beaks a little bit?  Why do you hold all of the guests?  You must let us all share. 
[00:51:30]  We do not want a war.  Oh, please.  All right.  And real fast before we take a quick music break here.  Pierre from Yonkers writes,  Holy crap.  You guys have to tell everyone to listen to that Orgasm Girl link on your website.  I was just sitting around bored, so I decided to check the page to see the new stuff.  Tell them, tell them, tell them, please.  It is audio porno.  I'll tell you that.  You'll hear this girl going at it.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  By herself.  And it was a call we couldn't put on the air, so we said,  Ah, what the hell, we'll put it on the website.  Under the Semi Live Studio link of the Opie and Anthony section of the WNEW website.  I defy any guy not to get a little stiffy listening to him.  All right, Tom Petty.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday, Tom Petty.  We have some Tom Petty info here.  Thursday at 10, the world premiere broadcast of his newest album, Echo. 
[00:52:30]  And then Friday and all weekend long, your chance to win tickets to his sold-out shows at Irving Plaza.  Broadcast is brought to you by Outback Steakhouse and Toyota.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How you doing, Eric?  It's pretty amazing.  Everyone is talking about WOW now.  You can just feel the excitement in the air.  It's building for tomorrow.  It's going to be good, man.  The weather is supposed to be beautiful.  We're all psyched.  Everyone making their signs.  I'm reading from truck drivers on the instant feedback. 
[00:53:00]  They're telling the people that washed the trailers not to wash the back doors.  Yeah.  Because they're putting WOW in the dirt.  There's one Teamster organization.  Yeah.  They're having a meeting.  And they're thinking of striking if they can't get a pass that all the trucks get a WOW on them.  Nice.  Sweet.  Well, you want to try the phones again, Ant?  Yeah.  Let's see if they work.  Let's see if anyone has anything today.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hi.  What's going on? 
[00:53:30]  Not much.  Who is this?  Anthony or Opie?  Both.  Both, yes.  Well, first of all, Anthony, you're not naked, are you?  No, I don't talk on the phone naked.  That's Opie.  Oh, is it Opie?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm not naked.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  No, please.  But you're not.  Okay, that's good.  Okay, first of all, I want to tell you guys, I'm in the business now for 15 years.  I'm an audio engineer.  You guys rock.  Number one.  Number two, my wife's in her 40s.  Yeah.  She wants to know.  She wants to participate.  And I want to give her a little incentive.  She's listening right now.  Should she?  Should she whip them out or not?  Of course, if she feels the urge. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  She's on the small side, though.  Good looking woman, and I'm not being prejudiced.  Yeah.  But she's small.  Are they sloppy?  No.  Like, what size is she?  You know, I'm going to say, oh boy, she's listening, and I'm going to be in trouble now.  34C, maybe?  That's not that small.  That's pretty big.  Okay, then a B.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Now, what do you want?  Let me ask you.  And maybe some people who are going to call in.  Tell me if, you know, you would like to look at that as well. 
[00:54:30]  Well, to be honest with you, you're asking the wrong person, because even an ugly set  to me is still like a turn-on.  Okay.  You're like I am, then.  Yeah.  Well, that's what wow is all about.  It doesn't matter if they're good, bad.  It's just you're seeing foreign boob.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's all about seeing boobs when you're not expecting anything.  In public, too.  I think it's a wonderful thing.  From a stranger, too.  The whole stranger aspect.  It's like, wow, man.  Yeah.  That's pretty damn cool.  Wow is a good name for it.  Who thought of this?  Well, I did.  Okay.  This was, yeah.  You sound like you're embarrassed.  Up in Boston.  Well, see, the show is like, Anthony is outright funny every day and does the impressions. 
[00:55:00]  And then I come up with the wacky little radio ideas.  Ideas that get us fired when we move to another city.  Please, don't get fired here, okay?  Well, yeah, I came up with a mayor prank.  Man, that was a little radical.  Well, whip him out Wednesday, though.  That's kind of good for me.  And then the Tuesday Night Horror Club, that was kind of...  I think they're ingenious ideas.  That's why we always say Opie has a little bit of the twisted side. </pre>
