<pre> The Rag in New York 1027W and W2 for Tuesday, Guns N' Roses, You Can Be Mine and Paradise  City from Appetite 4 Destruction.  Sophie and Anthony, why couldn't today be Wednesday?  Yes, what a beautiful day today.  Absolutely beautiful.  It's a little disturbed though on the drive in.  Why?  Well, a lot of the girls still bundled up today.  Did you notice that?  We're one layer away from seeing some stuff.  They're shedding like skin. 
[00:30]
 Yes, they are.  Yes.  We were really counting on the ride in today because we're like, okay, it's going to happen.  We get to start seeing the hot girls walking down the streets of New York Manhattan.  Yeah.  But they were bundled up still, man.  Yeah.  We need a few more warmer days.  We're getting there though.  Yes.  Yes, we are.  Isn't that a weird feeling when you start seeing girls half naked again after a long  winter?  Yeah.  You feel like you're a kid again.  That's just awesome.  It'll happen.  All right. 
[01:00]
 Well, here we are for another day of stupidity.  Hey, how you doing?  Now, we got to hunt down the guys with the signs from the wrestling Raw's War last night.  Yes, congratulations, you guys.  Great job.  I guess Raw is taped a week in advance.  Yeah, last night's Raw's War was taped last Tuesday at the Nassau Coliseum.  Yeah.  We were just at Anthony's for dinner and we're sitting there watching Raw's War and all of  a sudden Anthony goes, right there.  I go, there's one.  There's one. 
[01:30]
 And I look up and sure as not clear as day, a huge Opie and Anthony 316 sign.  Yeah.  About 10 rows up from the ring.  Yeah.  And it was there the whole first match, pretty prominently displayed.  Yeah.  And then there was another one.  It said Tuesday night Hummer Club member.  And there was an arrow facing down at the guy.  You guys rocked.  It was so funny.  You know what the funniest sign was last night though?  Which one?  The one that said, for gay sex call.  And there was a phone number and you know it's just some kid with his buddy's phone 
[02:00]
 number on it.  You know, holding up.  So later on it'll be like, hey, you dick.  What you do man?  I have people calling my house.  That's classic.  That's great stuff.  Yeah, I wonder who those guys were.  Well, hopefully they'll check in.  Yeah.  Great job.  Because we said we'd give you some prizes.  Yeah, we'll throw you some stuff.  We're doing that.  We've got to take care of the Opie and Anthony 316 sign.  And Tuesday night Hummer Club member with the arrow sign.  We saw both of those last night.  Job well done.  Anthony had signed at Raw. 
[02:30]
 Anthony!  Hello.  Hey, what's up buddy?  How you guys doing?  All right.  Is that mine in the air?  Yeah, you're in the air.  Oh yeah, I was there and I had it signed for you.  Which one was yours?  I don't know.  I had kind of crappy seats.  I don't know if you could have seen it.  These were pretty close.  They were within five minutes.  Yeah, I was at ringside.  Oh, you were?  What did your sign say?  It said Opie and Anthony plus Vince McMahon equals three wise men.  And on the bottom that I said Ted Turner is a butt plug.  Oh, God, we didn't see that one.  We definitely didn't see that one.  Yeah, I didn't get on TV.  That would have been the best sign, I think.  I looked. 
[03:00]
 I didn't see any.  You know what though?  I believe that you made the sign.  Stay on hold.  We're going to try to hook you up with something.  All right.  I'm going to try to hook you up with something.  All right.  I'm going to try to hook you up with something.  All right.  I'm going to try to hook you up with something.  All right.  I'm going to try to hook you up with something.  All right.  Great, guys.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you for taking care of us.  You guys are awesome.  Keep it up.  Thanks, Anthony.  There you have it.  Butt plug.  All right.  We're just getting started here. 
[03:30]
 Fax line two one two nine five seven WNEW.  Speaking of butt plug, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  You were at, you did a lot of work last night.  I was working a little bit on the website last night.  We went through some sound clips up there, a couple of things from Demented World including  the butt plug call and the 100 grand caller and a couple of things we've never played  on the air.  A woman who is so utterly pissed off at our show, she called up one of our bosses at our  old job and just goes off and her language is worse than anything we said on the air 
[04:00]
 ever, ever.  Ever.  It's hysterical.  I think I got that call somewhere.  You should play it.  We would have to bleep it.  Do you have it bleeped?  I think so.  Because this woman is talking about how awful we are and how our mothers must be sluts and  whores and she just starts cursing like crazy because she had her kids in the car and you  know with a mouth like hers she probably curses in front of her kids all the time.  She lost control.  Anthony, I got it.  Do you?  Yeah.  And it's all bleeped?  I think so.  Well play it.  We'll dump out of it if it's not bleeped. 
[04:30]
 We're in delay so if it's not bleeped we'll just have to pop out of it.  You'll just hear it end.  All right.  So this was a message left for the old boss?  Yeah.  She's not going to send us a text mail.  She starts out trying to be all calm.  It's hysterical.  She loses it.  Now you have the unedited version of this on the website with all the curses?  Yes.  Okay cool.  A message from February 10th at 6.57 PM.  Hello Glenn.  I'm sorry to do this to you.  Please forward this on to your general manager.  I'm wondering if someone is going to wait until someone goes in there and blows their  head off of those pigs that work in your station.  They're discovering that you're not going to be able to get in there. 
[05:00]
 They're disgusting pigs.  Their mothers must be swatting whores in order for them to go on the air and die the bleep  that they do.  I am very sick of not being able to get in my car and my obstinate is the son of a bitch  in the station falling into a pig-style bleeped stoking and I have a whole goddamn 60 yard  funeral with a thousand goddamn storks on.  I have children who are trying to wait.  Now if you guys don't stop it I'm going to turn my bleeped stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off. 
[05:30]
 I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm going to turn my stoking off.  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd.  And you can take your right to speak.  You shove it up your asses.  You can't stop it because now you've gotten me very pissed.  A drink for the mess.  Thank you.  Wow.  W-A-S, your pigsty effin' station.  Do you believe her?  I came across that last night.  I had to put it up on the website, unedited, so you can hear all of her curses.  That's funny.  Man, she starts to get a little bit of a 
[06:00]
 bit of a kick.  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm not a nerd.  She starts off like she's leaving a little voicemail about how angry she is at our show  and her language is worse than anything we've ever said on the air.  I forgot all about that.  No, no.  Our kids are in the car.  Our kids are probably in the car when you mouth off like that, you whore.  She can't hear me, but I don't care.  You know what she's talking about?  The bit.  Yeah.  We were playing High Mom, a great game.  We got to start doing some more High Mom calls. 
[06:30]
 And this guy called up his mom and announced to the whole world that he got fired from  work because he was caught masturbating at work on the job.  Yeah.  In the stock room.  So she heard that call, which I could find that.  I have children in the car.  I don't need them to hear about 16 year olds.  The call is hysterical.  Now I've got to find that call.  Now we've got to find that one.  And that's what she had a problem with.  Oops.  What else did you put on the website? 
[07:00]
 I got the Reverend Al song.  A lot of people have been asking about that.  So you had to send it to your friends.  The Yoshi thing.  What else did I put up on there?  Oh, you put that orgasm chicken.  Yeah.  We had a girl call up and she was watching a porno movie and she was pleasuring herself  and she did it for us on the air.  And we couldn't even put this on the air because it was real.  Yeah, it was graphic.  She was really doing this.  At one point she puts the phone somewhere else besides her mouth and you hear it. 
[07:30]
 And then she just has a full orgasm.  It's incredible audio.  I defy any guy to listen to it, not sport.  I swear to God.  So that's on the site as well.  Yeah, we'll be popping more stuff on there too now that I'm back in the swing.  Yeah, and then you've got the F lesson on it, unedited.  Unedited, you hear the F lesson.  The F word.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I love the people that have been bitching at me too.  Hey man, why don't you design your site better?  You know, my 16 year old kid could put a better site together.  Look, look. 
[08:00]
 It's not about bells, whistles and cute little graphics on my front page.  It's just about content.  Of course.  There's links and there's little text that tells you what the links are.  That's all you're going to get.  That's all you need.  That's it.  You don't want to go through all the pretty stuff.  Yeah, what do you want?  You want to get to the heart of the matter there.  Download a virtual reality 360 view of the studio for 10 minutes before you get to the  good stuff.  Shut up.  All right, we've got lots to do today obviously.  We got so many requests for the Yoshi song. 
[08:30]
 Hey, what is this?  Seven W and W the ride of New York to the Tuesday with the Rolling Stones.  Give me shelter and shattered.  It's opiate Anthony.  Hey, Anthony.  Uh, John doesn't like us.  What happened?  John Torres of New York.  Why don't you play more music and talk less?  Cause you aren't that funny.  Just let the music ride and you don't.  Ouch.  John at door, let's at aol.com.  Ow, that hurts John.  So John at door, let's at aol.com doesn't like us. 
[09:00]
 Anthony, what a sure.  Let's door.  Let's like D U R a L I T.  Yeah.  Well, that's coming.  AOL.com doesn't like us.  Doesn't like us at all.  He's going to be really bummed when we go all talk on our show, isn't he?  All right.  Look, I just want to say to everybody, uh, door, let D U R a L I T at aol.com.  Bad to have to happen to his email.  Right.  We just know email bombs. 
[09:30]
 Don't go doing stuff like that.  Don't send him the Melissa virus.  You know, don't condone that.  No, that's, that's really, that wouldn't be too cool.  Cause I know there's plenty of guys that listen, uh, little hackers that have a lot of those  little programs.  They could really pack out a email boxes and do things.  Yeah.  So just leave D U R a L I T at aol.com alone.  Right.  He's entitled to his opinion, obviously.  You know exactly.  And John, you know, and I have been through the ringer for the last five years.  If you're going to try to get to us, cause that's what you're trying to do. 
[10:00]
 Come up with something better than that.  Yeah.  That means nothing to us.  Oh, you got us.  Oh, ouch.  Okay.  We better play two first all afternoon.  Shut up.  Okay.  He wants to hear some, uh, the guy doesn't understand what we've been through and he  thinks a little note like that's going to get to us.  Yeah.  All right.  Um, I'm trying to find this great email from this lady.  Tomorrow is whip them out Wednesday.  Uh, and by the, by the looks of the email and the phone calls and the faxes, it looks 
[10:30]
 like tomorrow's going to be an absolute freak show on the, on the roadways.  Seems like everyone is getting a wow sign for tomorrow in hopes to see in some boobage.  Yeah.  Which is very, very cool.  Um, and it's kind of like fishing, you know?  You're not guaranteed to catch the big whopper tomorrow.  Exactly.  You just got to keep at it and be patient and enjoy the sightings of other people that  will call in and brag about what they've seen on the highways on whip them out Wednesday. 
[11:00]
 And then maybe next week you'll be the lucky guy.  You never know when it's going to happen.  That's what's so cool about the whip them out Wednesday phenomenon.  Yep.  You never know.  All you have to do is be driving on the road.  Yeah.  To participate.  And it doesn't matter rain or shine.  It'll happen tomorrow.  You'll have to lower the boob siding index.  If it's raining tomorrow.  It goes down, which means, uh, it just means your signs got to be a little bigger.  Yeah.  Brighter.  Like the sunburn.  You know, the sunburn index at a two because it's, you know, cloudy and rainy.  Yeah.  If it's a sunny day, you know, the sunburn index goes way up. 
[11:30]
 Yeah.  Oh, here it is from, uh, oh, she doesn't want me to use a real name.  Uh, Hi, open Anthony.  I love your show.  Just one thing.  Remind you, your other female listeners that some women like to be wowed too.  who has a wow sign of my car.  When I drive with my husband, we both like to get wowed, but I like to get wowed when  he is not with me.  Also.  Oh, also do you think you could fix me up?  I'm a very attractive five foot four blonde with 36 C's.  Wow.  Keep up the good work. 
[12:00]
 I'll be on the roadways tomorrow.  That sounds nice.  It sure does.  Yeah.  We do encourage the ladies to get involved too.  They like getting wowed.  There you go.  You know, I think pretty much if you're driving along ladies and you see a woman, you know,  if you're driving along ladies and you see a wow on a car, no matter if it's an old  guy, a young guy, a male, a female, that car wants to be wowed.  That's why the signs there.  If it's the mayor, it doesn't matter.  I'm going to sneak around my wow sign.  I'm going to let him know what we're also going to do tomorrow.  We're going to get Earl and Ben on the road. 
[12:30]
 Yeah.  They're going to be in the any W van.  They can have wow all over the van.  Wow.  And they're going to have a camera and they're going to be looking for wow.  So we could document some of this on the website.  Yeah.  So if you flash the any W van tomorrow, you just might end up on our website.  So keep that in mind because we want to bring the excitement to everyone else that doesn't  get wowed.  Of course.  It's going to be just nuts tomorrow and it goes on all summer.  So odds are it'll happen.  We have just begun.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to get the Yoshi song on. 
[13:00]
 A lot of people missed it from yesterday and there's a lot of people checking and they  want to hear it again.  God, is this bicyclist that got run over a delivery guy?  Um, I don't know.  I don't know either.  It looks like he's got a basket on his basket.  That's right where the exit for the upper level of the 59th Street bridge.  Let's out.  Is it?  Yeah.  Sixty third and second.  Another accident this time by a garbage truck.  They just had a huge article.  What in the daily news yesterday that the most dangerous vehicle on the roadways is  the garbage truck garbage trucks. 
[13:30]
 Really?  Not the cabs.  But you know, without a doubt, the most dangerous car on the road is those damn livery cabs.  Oh, trying to go around the van.  Oh, it's just fell in front of the tires.  Well, know what he did, which a lot of these bikers like to do in New York.  They tap you on the side of the car.  Yeah.  Let you know you're coming.  They're coming around.  So the guy is trying to pass the the garbage truck.  He's tapping on the side like I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  He lost his like his bike, whatever. 
[14:00]
 Yeah.  Fell down, fell down and and got run over.  How his head got run over.  Oh, stop it.  Did it?  Yeah, that's how he died.  Oh, does anyone have any pictures of that?  Oh, stop.  We wouldn't put that on the website.  Anyway, we got to play the Yoshi song, Anthony.  OK.  Anthony and his brother Joe hard at work over the Easter vacation or holiday or whatever.  And now we have a Yoshi song.  One, two, seven, W, N, E, W, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday, Pearl Jam, Rearview 
[14:30]
 Mirror from Versus and Jeremy too.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I found that phone call.  Oh, you got it?  Yes.  And now we got to go back and explain this again, I guess.  But that's OK.  Yeah.  Anthony put a lot of sound clips on the on the website last night, building it back up  to its former glory.  Opie trying a bunch of people are still having a hard time finding all these clips and JPEGs  and GIFs and all that.  All the fun stuff.  It's under the semi live studio cam of the Opie and Anthony section of the W and EW site. 
[15:00]
 It's kind of kind of hard to get to.  It's not an easy just click on any W and you see it there.  Right.  And it kind of click on the air staff and then our pictures and then semi live studio  cam.  And then you go through a disclaimer and you click on the link after the disclaimer and  a separate browser pops up.  Oh, it's very involved.  Lots of goodies there, though.  Sure.  I think we're going to have to change the length of the semi live studio cam.  Yeah, because it's not just the semi live studio cam anymore. 
[15:30]
 You know, we have a bunch of companies that want to set up a camera in here where when  we're on the air, you know, people could check us out, you know, during the show.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What do you think?  A live cam?  Yeah, why not?  Live cam.  I mean, most of the time it'll be really boring because, you know, it's usually just you and  I doing our show.  Yeah.  So visually it's kind of boring.  Then there are those times like Friday when it's an exciting thing to check out.  Things going on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  A bunch of companies are emailing us.  Maybe we'll get back to them.  Yeah.  Pop it right up there or something over the door. 
[16:00]
 Way over there?  Yeah.  Because you get a whole look at the studio.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  All right.  So one of the phone calls Anthony put on the site, we have a lot of unedited calls.  We got to put up their stuff we just couldn't put on the radio.  Well, that's the fun thing about the web too is everything on the radio has got to be bleeped  out.  The bad words.  Ah.  Not the web.  You get the F word in all its glory.  Exactly.  So a lot of the things you put up there were never on the radio.  No. 
[16:30]
 All right.  So we love playing this game called High Mom.  Our favorite of all time was High Mom in Pornow, which is on our Domain World CD.  That's brutal.  And then the second favorite for me is High Mom in Jail.  High Mom, I'm gay was funny.  High Mom, I'm gay is very good.  If anyone has any ideas for High Mom calls, by the way, you could be a radio star.  Just get a hold of us.  We're willing to do new ones.  We haven't done a new one in a while.  Yeah.  Get somebody to call up their mom and lie to them.  So one of the ones we did was, High Mom, I got fired from work today for masturbating. 
[17:00]
 On the job, yeah.  On the job.  So let's play that first here.  And then we can replay the complaint call we got because of this bit.  And then everything will make sense finally.  All right.  Finally.  So check this out.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play High Mom.  I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom was really go-able.  Hold on the line. 
[17:30]
 It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Thanks.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  Can you pick me up from work?  How come I can't hear you?  Can you pick me up from work?  Yeah.  I got fired.  What?  I got fired from work today.  Can you pick me up?  No way.  Please pick me up.  What the heck happened?  It's kind of embarrassing.  What are you going to tell me?  I was in the stock room, and someone walked in on me 
[18:00]
 when I was masturbating.  What?  I got caught masturbating in the stock room.  And they're going to have to pick me up.  They're going to give you a warning?  They're going to have to pick me up.  What are you, nuts?  Just come pick me up, will you, Mom?  Chad, you're supposed to do stuff like that,  the privacy of your own home.  I know.  It's embarrassing, Mom.  I don't want to.  So where were you?  At a payphone or something?  No, I'm at work.  I'm here.  Everyone's been looking at me and laughing at me and stuff. 
[18:30]
 Just come pick me up, will you, please?  All right.  Want me to meet you out back?  Huh?  Want me to meet you out back?  Yeah, just pick me up where you dropped me off this morning.  You OK?  Besides my pride, I'm embarrassed.  Just pick me up as soon as you get a chance.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  I'll be there.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh my god, dude.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Ha ha ha.  How was that?  That was awesome, actually. 
[19:00]
 You're going to be pissed out.  Wow, I can't believe you said that to your own mother.  My mom's young, you know.  She had an issue with AKs, so, you know, she looked cool like that.  That's funny.  The best line was, you're supposed to do that in the privacy of your own home.  Dude, it'd definitely hook you up with tickets.  All right, man.  Hold on the line.  OK.  And there you have it.  Yeah.  I love that.  My mom got fired from masturbating.  That's pretty insane.  Can you imagine calling up your mom and saying that?  That's not an easy thing to do.  No, no. 
[19:30]
 I don't think I would have.  So in open-ended terms, that's a pretty tame bit, I believe.  Oh, yeah, that's nothing.  But then we had the lunatic lady call and leave a voicemail with one of the bosses.  Very angry.  A message from Stu.  What's that?  What's that?  February 10th, ask, 6.57 PM.  Hello, Glenn.  I'm sorry to do this to you.  Please forward this on to your general manager.  I'm wondering if someone's going to wait till someone goes in there and blows the head off 
[20:00]
 of those pigs that work in your station.  They are disgusting pigs.  Their mothers must be swept in whores in order for them to go on the air and do the  s*** that they do.  I am very sick of not being able to get in my car and my auction is the son of a bitch  who's stationed far into your pig-style f***ing station and I have to hear a goddamn  16-year-old fiddle with the sounds of going to those stock rooms.  I have children who I'm trying to raise.  Now if you guys don't stop it, I'm going to turn my f***ing life into the cause of  bursting your asses. 
[20:30]
 Now please, Glenn, as you can see, I'm upset.  I'm a professional person.  I've got children.  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd.  And you can take your right to speak and shove it up your asses.  You won't stop it because now you've gotten me very close.  Now please, so is the man.  Thank you.  I'm not a nerd.  I love that.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm a professional person.  I'm not a nerd.  Her whole argument just has no merit to it when she speaks like that. 
[21:00]
 Yeah, she's speaking like a truck driver.  She's trying to raise her children and my mother is a... our mothers are sluts and whores.  Wait a minute.  What are you saying?  Look at your language.  Look at you.  Take your freedom of speech and shove it.  I'm sorry, Missy.  That's written into the Constitution.  I don't think your loud mouth is going to stop it.  All the times my mom got mad at me, she never used language like that.  No.  You can just picture her in the car.  I can't believe these f***ing guys. 
[21:30]
 I don't want to go.  Poor kids.  My kids sitting there listening to this s.  So you know what happens?  The kids sneak up in their room and under their covers they're listening to our show.  Oh, they're doing heroin to deal with that mother.  Imagine having a mother like her calling a radio station because she accidentally keeps  hitting the station.  That's the best.  When we're on, no, she's listening and she's getting titillated and it upsets her.  She's upset that she actually enjoys it because she's not supposed to.  WNEW, New York, Infinity Broadcasting.

Ah, we had one of the guys from Men's Hair Now come in, a client.  Yeah, we must say when we heard Men's Hair Now wanted to come aboard, we were like, come 
[23:30]
 on, those hair places, you know, you could walk around the streets of Manhattan, you  could tell who has the hair pieces and who doesn't.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  The secret is that the people with the good ones, you just don't know.  Yeah.  You think it's just their hair.  And they don't want to advertise it.  Right.  Because it looks so real.  They're like, hey, if people think it's real, why should I tell them that it's not real?  So they brought this guy in to convince us.  And we saw the guy and we were hooked.  We were like, whoa.  I didn't know why he was here.  I heard, oh, a client is here to meet you. 
[24:00]
 And I'm talking to the guy and I didn't know what he was from.  And he had a big full head of hair and it looked natural with a natural hairline.  Wasn't like a big possum on his head.  No, it didn't.  That most bad hair pieces looked like.  He didn't have doll head.  No, didn't have that either.  It looked natural.  I couldn't tell.  And then we were hooked.  So if you're looking to take care of your situation, I guess we could explain it like  that.  If you're a bald guy, it's important.  Appearance is important no matter what people say.  And if you have no hair, you've got a bald head, people notice.

 All right.  Another guy that doesn't like us on the SF feedback?  Yeah, I don't know.  I think he just wants to get email.  Oh, really?  Like he bats this and then put his real email address up there.  So he probably just wants friends.  Oh.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW for Tuesday.  Def Leppard.  We haven't played Def Leppard in a while.  Foolin' and Rocket is Ovid Anthony.  Hey.  Their Behind the Music was one of the better ones on VH1.  Well, you need that tragedy, you know, to make the Behind the Music interesting to watch. 
[25:30]
 The Duran Duran one?  That was on over the weekend.  There was a little cocaine?  Yeah.  That was it?  You're a band in the 80s?  Ooh, ooh, Revelation there.  You might have done a little blow.  Ooh, boy.  You know Sandy, my girlfriend, she did the whole Duran Duran thing where she had the  posters in her room and stuff.  Yeah.  When she found out that the guys were doing coke in the 80s, she was all bummed.  Like, every band did coke in the 80s.  In the 80s?  I think every human being that was living in the 80s did coke. 
[26:00]
 Did a little bit of the tootage, check it out with your buds.  Then you move along.  You go to heroin.  But yeah, they didn't, I don't know, they didn't have the dirt road where they're shaking  the car speeding down it to signify there was an accident.  In black and white, how they do the recreation.  They didn't show the little swings, swinging empty to show the tragic childhood that they  had.  I love that one.  Yeah.  You made it. 
[26:30]
 As a child, you should, the swing with the music, you know.  Well, you made a great observation when they show that desolate highway.  Yeah.  For all the behind the music, it's the same road.  Yeah.  When Metallica had that horrible accident.  The bus that crashed, it was the same.  They used stock footage of the same road for every behind the music.  Yeah.  The Lafe Garrett one, when he had the accident with his buddy in it, it was the same road.  It's like, wow, it must be a dangerous road.  Everyone.  All the rock stars are crashing on that road. 
[27:00]
 James Dean drove down that road.  1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York, Tuesday with the Dave Matthews Band.  Don't drink the water.  And so much to say.  It's open Anthony.  Thank you for joining us for the ride home today.  Once again, we appreciate that.  Yes, we do.  And well, I got to mention some really fast here.  Baseball season started, as we all know.  As I am, I am.  And I was listening to, well, the fan.  And already the negative Yankee and Met fans are coming out of the woodwork. 
[27:30]
 Because they both lost their first game of the season.  It's one game.  One game.  One game.  And they're calling up and just panicking on the fan.  Well, obviously, getting off a lousy start on a talent.  Look at this.  Seventy-five million dollar flops for the Mets.  Yeah, the post on the front page of the sports section, they're saying 75 million flops.  Seventy-five million dollar flops. 
[28:00]
 The Mets.  I mean, come on.  One game.  One game.  Glad as always, next year to look forward to.  Obviously, it's going to take a lot of rebuilding.  It's the first game.  First game and people lose it already.  Oh, get a grip.  We can't give anyone any credit.  No one gets any credit.  How did my giants do?  See, I hope you Yankee fans are happy.  You're Roger the Rock and Clement Clementine.  They're pretty much saying he's a boss because he lost. 
[28:30]
 It's like, he's got all that money and he can't even win.  They might as well trade him.  Come on, trade him.  A savvy day for Yankee fans.  Obviously, money not well spent.  It's going to be horrible.  Try to rebuild this year.  So maybe in a couple of years they'll have a team that can be competitive.  Obviously, after game one, it's all over for the year.  Isn't that right, Mikey?  And the callers are just as bad, though.  They're all just losing it, you know? 
[29:00]
 What is he showing us?  Roger the Rock.  Yeah.  First stage for Rock.  Okay, that's nice.  Thanks for interrupting the bit for that.  That was really good.  Wow.  No, really.  What's next?  Comedy timing is easy to get right back on track.  Thanks for showing us that.  I didn't know we were talking about the Rock and the Yankees.  Oh, that's right. 
[29:30]
 We were.  Great.  Let's just continue where we were, I guess.  Hey, how about that?  No, I see you just can't step back into it.  All right.  That's good.  Wait a minute.  A bunch of people want to hear this because we were talking about the High Mom games.  And this is a classic.  We haven't played in a long, long time.  And this is just heartbreaking to listen to.  Yeah.  We're starting to do new High Moms.  A bunch of listeners are coming up with ideas for future High Mom calls. 
[30:00]
 I liked High Mom.  I was molested by Uncle Blank.  It was like, fill in the blank, any uncle.  That's a good one.  That would really get them rolling.  That's sick.  Can you imagine a daughter calls a mother and starts telling her that and she's like,  And I was too by the same uncle.  The mother admits to it.  I want to do High Mom.  I'm a crack whore.  That's a good one.  Yes.  A crack whore.  You could describe that to your mom on the phone.  Like, what's a crack whore? 
[30:30]
 Well, I have sex for crack.  Crack.  Oh, okay.  We could try that.  What we've got to do is get some really good prizes because then the people come out of  the woodwork to call their moms.  Yes, they need a little payoff.  They're not going to do it for a CD but they'll do it for some good concert tickets because  it gets so stressful.  For example, we'll play this from the archives here from our demanded work.  And there you have it.  Did you hear her?  She was like crying toward the end of that call.  Yeah.  She was picturing her little girl, you know, perched up in a phone movie. 
[31:00]
 Getting fouled.  Getting the pile driver move.  Yeah.  Your daughter is a dirty girl.  That is so cruel.  Yeah, nasty one.  But we're looking for more people to be cruel to their mom.  Yeah.  We want to do High Mom and that's how it works.  You've got to BS your mom into making her believe that you're doing something very bad.  We got a bunch of calls.  I've got to find them.  I won't find them today.  High Mom calls that went horribly bad. 
[31:30]
 Oh, horribly bad.  Yeah.  Where the mom is just hysterically crying, hanging up.  We can't get a hold of her again.  It's very bad.  I mean, it just went horribly wrong.  I remember a couple of those.  The High Mom, I'm in jail.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  Because the kilo of coke in the trunk.  Yeah.  Mother started crying.  Then the guy wouldn't let up on her and we finally jumped in but she had hung up already. 
[32:00]
 It was too late to stop the train wreck.  It was just so bad.  Sometimes they don't all have funny happy endings, people.  No, just like in real life.  Yeah.  WNEW New York, Infinity Broadcasting.  Sorry about that.  Very important.  Very important.  We've got to get that ID in there.  That's right.  Every single hour.  The FCC is listening.  Anthony?  Yes.  The Autofinance of America.  Yeah.  I'll be picture paying your bills every month.  You're going to pay your car loan and it's 20, 30, 40, 50 dollars less than it usually 
[32:30]
 is.  Wouldn't you be happy?  I'd be ecstatic.  You could use that money for things that are fun, not just paying your car loan.  Yeah, I didn't realize that this was even possible to refinance your car loan.  I know you could do it with mortgages and stuff but this is a great idea.  We met with these people and they're like, yeah, man, we could save people a lot of money.  All they have to do is give us a call and we'll work with them and see what we can do  for them.  You ask how, interest rates go down and they can refinance your loan with a lower rate  and you pay less.  Now, they're talking 30, 40, even 50 dollars a month they could save you. 
[33:00]
 Give them a call.  It's Autofinance of America, 1-800-993-1000.  All right, right around the corner, the Mary Poppins song.  Getting way too much email about that.  We'll play it again if you haven't heard it yet.  1027W, the Rock of New York, Sting Me for the Black Crows and twice as hard before that,  it's Ophid Anthony and in the studio, Ben the Fag.  What's Ben the Fag doing here?  Well, he rushed down here because Roger wants us to make a concert announcement, Anthony. 
[33:30]
 Why doesn't Roger come in?  Roger's scared to come in here because we just make fun of his voice and stuff so he  doesn't understand the boy.  He sends one of his peeps down here.  He sends one of his peeps.  All right, learn that from old Dirty.  What do you got, man?  Hole at Roseland, May 18th.  Hole?  Hole.  Tickets won't sell Friday at 11 a.m.  Ticketmaster.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Courtney Love, of course, you remember what Larry Flint said yesterday. 
[34:00]
 He's got a nice bush.  All right, wait, I got that.  Hold on, we got a little bit of a...  That's good for the announcement, sure.  Oh my God, where is that?  Larry Flint, we talked to him on the phone yesterday.  He was on the telephone and we asked him if he saw Courtney Love naked.  I don't know if this is even it.  Hey, did you ever see Courtney Love naked when you guys were filming that movie?  Yeah, I've seen Courtney Love naked a couple times. 
[34:30]
 Love that.  What would you rate it on a scale of one to ten?  I bet you she showed you some stuff.  She had nice cans in that movie, too.  Did she show you her balloon knot?  Balloon knot.  That's one of the great things about Hustler. 
[35:00]
 You see balloon knots in Hustler.  It's going to have bent over everything.  All right, Larry doesn't want to play it.  All right, Larry.  Well, Mr. Flint, thanks for checking in today.  Okay, guys.  That's Larry Flint.  Wow!  All right, so we got a hold at Roseland May 9th.  Tickets go on sale Saturday.  May 18th.  Oh, May 18th, sorry.  Tickets go on sale Friday.  Friday.  I got all the info wrong.  Matt Devotee will have tickets for you on the night. 
[35:30]
 Okay, I got an idea for the show, though.  Can we get a special section at Roseland for the whole show?  And then we go on the air and we offer listeners a chance to win, a chance to win to get into  Courtney's box.  What?  Like a box.  Yeah, like a box at Roseland.  We just rope off a section for the whole show and then we go on the air and then give listeners  a chance to get into Courtney's box for the show.  Yeah. 
[36:00]
 See Courtney's hole.  Live and up close because you'll be right in her box.  Yeah, sure.  Opening for a whole bush.  And tool.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Ben the fag.  Thank you.  All right, we got to play the Mary Poppins thing from yesterday.  Get it out of the way today.  A little legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. 
[36:30]
 Yes.  Big story a couple weeks ago.  We were about two weeks too late because we found this in the archives and went, oh man,  we should have played it when they were talking about the pot issue again.  Yeah.  That's my new favorite song.  Token up Mary.  Oh man.  Yeah, I was reading an email overnight from a guy who said that he heard that song on  the way home last night and then he went home and his little kid was watching Mary Poppins  and he walks in the door and he just he fell on the floor laughing so hard because he remembered 
[37:00]
 the Mary Poppins song he heard on our show.  All right.  And nobody would laugh at more than the song itself, Anthony.  He said he walked into the room just when Ed Wynn was doing his scenes.  Oh, Ed Wynn was in Mary Poppins, don't you know.  The flaming fruit.  You never knew or thought of him as a flamer back then when you watched it.  Well, because you were eight and you were a kid you just thought he was like a funny 
[37:30]
 old guy.  Yeah, you didn't know the difference.  And then you tune in years later and you see this guy, you know, look we're flying.  Why are the children flying, don't you know?  Mary, look, I'll do a headstand.  I'll be your umbrella stand.  Go ahead, put it in.  Go ahead, put your umbrella in, Mary.  Now open it.  Go ahead.  You can't, huh?  Yeah, tight, huh?  Don't you know? 
[38:00]
 What were some of the other movies he was in?  Was he in March of the Wooden Soldiers?  I don't know if he's in that one.  That's an old movie.  Or was he in Toys and Babel, right?  I think it was Toys and Toilet.  Toys and Babel was in The Pornover.  I know, that's Toys and Babel.  I saw that Pornover title.  I was in the butt plug scene.  Toys and Babel. 
[38:30]
 That's a hot one.  The land of misfit sex toys.  That was him.  He was Charlie in the Box.  Cool.  In person, okay.  A lot of people calling in.  All right, Anthony, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner is now available to you.  What?  Stacker 2?  I use it all the time.  That's why I'm so full of energy.  Don't you know?  Look at me.

[40:00]
 Hey, what's up, man?  Who's this?  This is Pearl from New Jersey.  And what happened to you, Paul?  I'm driving 287 going on from work and I spotted an early sighting, man.  An early Whip-A-Mount Wednesday sighting?  You got it.  I can't believe it.  That's huge.  How did it happen?  I'm just driving along.  I happened to have my Wow sign on my car a little early.  I figured, let me get it on.  So tomorrow I wouldn't have to worry about it.  And there they were.  They were driving down the road.  I looked over and boom, she was hanging.  She was actually at the top of the roof of the car. 
[40:30]
 Honestly, God.  I'm telling you, man.  And I'll tell you, there was no cars around.  It was just me and them.  And I just beat my horn, gave them the thumbs up sign, and they kept going.  I couldn't believe it.  How psyched are you?  I'm unbelievable.  I wish I was a truck driver.  I'd be on the road all day tomorrow.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck in the office.  Well, you got a sighting.  That's cool.  I'm telling you, unbelievable.  You guys are great, man.  I listen to you every day.  Well, congrats on the sighting.  All right, great, man.  Everybody, I'm telling you, if anybody's listening, I'm telling you, put your Wow sign up because  it's going to be great.  I'm telling you.  Unbelievable.  You guys are great, man.  It works. 
[41:00]
 We can't wait for tomorrow.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Keep up the good work, man.  Cool.  Look at him, the early bird.  You can tell by his voice that he definitely saw something.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Very nice.  I got an email if you want me to read that.  Yeah, screw it.  We can talk a little bit here.  This guy over here, my mouse is screwing up.  There we go. 
[41:30]
 Tom Lindenhurst.  He goes, you won't believe what happened to me the other day.  I printed a copy of your Wow sign and took it into a card store to make copies for my  friends at work.  There was a good looking girl at the counter.  Sorry, I had to do it.  Can you start over because the music makes it.  You won't believe what happened to me the other day.  I printed a copy of your Wow sign and took it to the card store to make copies for my  friends at work.  There was a good looking girl at the counter.  I made the copies and went to pay for them. 
[42:00]
 I laid them down on the countertop to get my money out.  The girl looked down at them and looked around the store.  Then she said, Bopi and Anthony, right?  I said, yep, number one.  Then she said, I'll be the first and picked up her shirt over her head right there in  the store.  Wow.  Wowed me.  That's why you say wow.  Yeah.  Why doesn't that ever happen to me?  Oh, it continues.  Oh, sorry.  Then we went into the back of the store. 
[42:30]
 She said she was just filling in until college started again.  Well, then she took all her clothes off.  You're making that up.  Yeah, of course I am.  Shut up.  That's always how those Penthouse Forum things start.  Yeah.  I'm reading those Penthouse and us Forum.  I was a guy, you know, I was in doing some work on the house and the daughter came downstairs  standing there out of the shower glistening with soap on.  This doesn't happen.  Shut up. 
[43:00]
 It's like, oh, very good.  Heather from Jersey.  Man, you know, we have a ton of people that listen in Jersey.  We love Jersey.  I just want to acknowledge that.  Yeah.  It seems like we hear from New Jersey more than any other area.  More than Manhattan, more than Westchester, more than our home area of Long Island.  Yeah.  Heather writes, I just pissed over Stone Mary Poppins.  You sick boys just turned my childhood memories into a new twisted dream of her toking a fatty.  Nice.  How do you think they flew? 
[43:30]
 They flew with an umbrella.  Figure it out.  Smoking weed.  Smoking weed.  All right.  What do you want to do here?  Do you want to play music or?  Yeah, we'll take some calls.  Let's see what people are talking about.  Hi, NDAW.  Yeah.  How many dupes do you guys think Julie Andrews had a smoke to expose her breasts in Victor  Victoria?  Oh, a lot.  Who wanted to see that?  Yeah, that's true.  But think about that in relation to the email you just got. 
[44:00]
 That's true.  She looked, I don't know, you saw her boobs obviously.  They look like two fried eggs with gravy stains.  Pancakes with little eraser noses in the middle or some crap like that.  Give up the good work guys.  Hi, man.  Is Julie Andrews the one that had the surgery and can't sing now?  Is that her?  Yeah, I think so.  Hi, NDAW.  Hello.  Yeah, are they doing any requests?  Oh, no.  What do you want to hear?  Oh, you want to hear the Gerbil song? 
[44:30]
 Sure.  It's open, Anthony.  We got you on the air.  That's one of my favorite songs, don't you know?  The Gerbil song.  It's very close to my heart and other places, don't you know?  Should I find the Gerbil song?  I don't know.  We play it a lot.  I don't know.  We'll look for it.  No, you don't want to play that on the phone?  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I just don't want to drive it into the ground. 
[45:00]
 Hi, NDAW.  Hello.  Hello.  Turn down the radio.  We're on delay.  What do you got?  Hello?  They don't get it.  Hi, NDAW.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, you guys rock.  We tell you, I know I'm a little whacked out of the head right now.  It's the first time I've tried calling you guys and I actually got through.  Cool.  I'm from Jersey, bud.  I know.  Why do you Jersey guys like us, it seems?  You guys are awesome.  You guys are definitely number one in my book. 
[45:30]
 Keep up the good work, man.  All right, thank you.  Catch you later.  Bye.  Bye.  I like Jersey, home of Tony Soprano.  Hi, NDAW.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  How are you doing?  All right, man.  What's up?  I got a hi-mom story for you.  You do?  Yeah, I was able to actually pull one off in person.  Okay.  First, I got a question for you though.  Yeah.  How did your three listeners cast 80,000 votes for the competition against Kara?  Yeah, we just don't have anyone listening to us.  But, 80,000 votes, guys.  Yeah, not bad.  We're pretty satisfied about that.  Not bad for three listeners.  According to Fla Fla Floli, Baba Booy, we only have three listeners. 
[46:00]
 Yeah, I think we're up to about seven now, so we're pretty proud of that.  All right.  I don't know, bulls.  I don't think anybody is listening to them, bulls.  I was able to pull a hi-mom in person.  You know, the funny thing is, boy Gary ran into Rick, our producer at what, Rodica?  Yeah.  And then he didn't want, he made sure that we didn't mention him on the air.  Right.  He was scared.  He doesn't want people to know that we actually know him or something.  He specially requested, hey, tell those guys not to mention my name on the air, okay? 
[46:30]
 Don't say, Baba Booy, I'm the air, because my bull will get mad at me.  Oh brother.  So what's going on, buddy?  I got a hi-mom.  Oh yeah.  This just goes back a while ago.  I was about 17.  I had a friend of mine who was an auxiliary police officer.  He brought me home in his uniform and I was cuffed up and everything.  He told my mom, I was arrested trying to steal a police car. 
[47:00]
 My mom nearly had a heart attack at the front door.  I wasn't able to keep it going long because I really thought I was going to kill her.  It's really not.  It shows how gullible moms are when their kids are in trouble.  Well of course.  That whole protection thing comes out, you know?  I don't think it would work on a hi-dad, you know?  No, not at all.  I'd be a son of a bitch.  Let him rock.  That's true for the most part.  We've got to get some more hi-mom calls on the air.  I want to make a request too. 
[47:30]
 I want to hear the Yoshi song again.  Man, we've been pounding that a lot.  Alright, maybe we'll play before we get out of here again.  Great.  Alright man.  Great show guys.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Roger has decided to come into the studio.  He must be listening to the number four bull.  Hi Roger.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Good.  Good.  What's up?  Why didn't you come in with the whole concert announcement?  I was trying to put together your list for your next off-site and I needed to get it 
[48:00]
 done before Gary leaves.  Ah, our next what?  Our next remote.  He didn't want to say remote.  I said off-site.  Same thing.  I didn't know what the word was.  I didn't know what the word was.  Remote.  Alright, can we tell people where we're going to be broadcasting from or not yet?  I think tomorrow.  Tomorrow, alright.  Alright, cool.  Announce it tomorrow.  Alright, I'll just wait.  So this is going to be actually a very good time.  Okay, sure.  Honestly, really fast.  A bunch of people want to send in wow designs. 
[48:30]
 Do you have an email address that you don't want to give out?  I actually don't even know what my corporate address is.  I use my personal one which I don't know.  No, I don't want to do that.  Oh no.  So send it to Scott Colombo.  Really?  No.  No.  You know, I'd say the best thing to do is if they have designs, if they could print  it out and overnight it to hear it to the station to my attention, that would be great.  Okay.  It's, you know, Roger WNEW, 888 7th Avenue. 
[49:00]
 New York, New York, New York.  10th floor.  Okay.  New York, New York.  Alright.  10106.  Because we're hammering out a design and we're going to have it hopefully within the next  week or two.  We need to have the design by Friday so that we can go into production for it.  I know there's a lot of listeners interested in making something so I was thinking wow  spelt out with pop-talk.  You'll never live down like that.  Anthony, we have a guy in the line that says that we're bashing Stern. 
[49:30]
 When did we bash Stern?  I don't know.  Let's get him on the air.  But look what I have to do.  I've got to go all the way over to the phones.  To click the phones down.  We've only been telling the engineers for weeks that the phones need to be right in  front of us.  But let's go all the way over here so we can get this phone call on the air.  Alright now let me get all the way back over here.  What's up buddy?  What?  What?  Hello?  That's good.  That's all right.  Get a better phone. 
[50:00]
 Take the wax out of your ears.  Yeah, like we were bashing Stern.  People don't understand.  You can talk about Howard Stern if you're on the radio.  He's a fixture in the city.  Has been for many years.  And just talking about him doesn't mean you're bashing him. 
[50:30]
 And I think Howard can defend himself.  He doesn't need his little butt buddies to call in every time we mention him.  We have said in the past, we respect the man greatly.  He's done great things in radio.  You know, what more does anybody want?  Jesus.  Jesus Mary Joseph.  That guy makes $18,000 a year.  Howard makes about $18 million and this guy feels like Howard needs to help.  You know.  I listened to Howard for many, many, many years.  It's one of the reasons I wanted to get into radio. 
[51:00]
 Obviously.  But Don Stern holds all of the listeners and all of the guests like so many nickels and  dimes in his pockets.  Don Stern, you must share the wealth.  You must let us all draw from the wealth.  Can we not wet our beaks a little bit?  Why do you hold all of the guests?  You must let us all share. 
[51:30]
 We do not want a war.  Oh, please.  All right.  And real fast before we take a quick music break here, Pierre from Yonkers writes, Holy  crap.  You guys have to tell everyone to listen to that orgasm girl link on your website.  I was just sitting around bored, so I decided to check the page to see the new stuff.  Tell them, tell them, tell them, please.  It is audio porno.  I'll tell you that.  You hear this girl going at it by herself. 
[52:00]
 And it was a call we couldn't put on the air.  So we said, Oh, what the hell?  We'll put it on the website under the semi live studio link of the Opie and Anthony section  of the W on EW website.  I defy any guy not to get a little stiffy listening to.  All right, Tom Petty.  One oh two seven W.N.E.W.  The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday.  Tom Petty, we have some Tom Petty info here.  Thursday at 10, the world premiere broadcast of his newest album Echo. 
[52:30]
 And then Friday and all weekend long, your chance to win tickets to his sold out shows  at Irving Plaza.  Broadcast is brought to you by Outback Steakhouse and Toyota.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi, you there.  It's pretty amazing.  Everyone is talking about wow.  Now you can just feel the excitement in the air.  It's building for tomorrow.  It's going to be good, man.  The weather is supposed to be beautiful.  We're all psyched.  Everyone making their signs.  I'm reading from truck drivers on the instant feedback. 
[53:00]
 They're telling the people that watch the trailers not to watch the back doors.  Yeah, because they're putting wow in the dirt.  There's a there's one teamster organization.  They're having a meeting and they're thinking of striking if they can't get a pass that  all the trucks that get a wow on them.  Nice.  Sweet.  Well, you want to try the phones again?  Yeah, let's see if they work.  Let's see if anyone has anything today.  Hi, NW.  Hello.  Hi, what's going on? 
[53:30]
 And I'm watching with Anthony or Opie?  Both.  First of all, Anthony, you're not naked, are you?  No, I don't talk on the phone naked.  That's OK.  Opie?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  No, I'm not naked.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  No, please.  OK, that's good.  OK, first of all, I want to tell you guys I'm in the business now.  Fifteen years.  I'm an audio engineer.  You guys rock.  Number one.  Number two, my wife's in her forties.  Yeah.  She wants to know she wants to participate.  I want to give her a little incentive.  She's listening right now.  Should she?  Should she whip him out or not?  Of course, if she feels the urge. 
[54:00]
 Yes, she's on the small side, though.  Good looking woman.  And I'm not being prejudiced.  Yeah.  But she's small.  Are they sloppy?  No.  Like what?  What size is she?  Ah, you know, I'm going to say.  Oh boy.  She's listening.  I'm going to be in trouble now.  Thirty four C maybe.  That's pretty big.  OK, then a B.  OK, all right.  Now, what do you want?  Let me ask you.  And maybe some people who are going to call in.  Tell me if you would like to look at that as well. 
[54:30]
 Well, to be honest with you, you're asking the wrong person because even an ugly set  to me is still like a turn on.  OK, you're like I am then.  That's what wow is all about.  It doesn't matter if they're good, bad.  It's just you're seeing foreign boob.  Yeah, it's all about seeing boobs when you're not expecting it.  In public, too.  I think it's a wonderful thing.  From a stranger to the whole stranger aspect.  It's like, wow, man.  Yeah, that's pretty damn cool.  And what's a good name for it?  Who thought of this?  Uh, well, I did.  OK.  This was, uh, yeah.  You sound like you're embarrassed.  Up in Boston.  Well, see, the show is like Anthony is out outright funny every day and does the impressions. 
[55:00]
 And then I come up with the wacky little radio ideas.  I guess that got us fired.  We moved to another city.  Please don't get fired here, OK?  Yeah, I came up with a mayor prank.  Um, that was a little radical.  Well, whip them out Wednesday, though.  That's that's kind of good for me.  And then and the Tuesday Night Hammer Club, that was kind of.  I think they're genius ideas.  But we always say Opie has a little bit of the twisted side. </pre>
