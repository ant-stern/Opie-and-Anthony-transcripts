<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to another.  The show began with a discussion about rising taxes in New York City and nationwide, focusing on the perceived unfairness and mismanagement of public funds by entities like the MTA.  Callers shared anecdotes about exorbitant tolls, particularly the Triborough Bridge (now the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), and the seemingly wasteful $4 million spent on renaming signage.  The conversation branched out to include former Governor Elliot Spitzer's scandals, a shooting in Mastic, Long Island, a Pennsylvania gun show, poor movie theater service, and controversies in professional sports (Sean Avery, Steve Williams, Stephon Marbury).  The hosts also jokingly previewed an upcoming segment featuring a PTA mom and a 13-year-old boy. One host recounted a mishap involving lotion instead of conditioner.

Next, Anthony described multiple bug infestations at the Luxembourg Cafe.  This transitioned into a discussion with a caller, Bruce, about the NHL's hypocrisy regarding player suspensions for language compared to accepting advertising from Viagra and Cialis.  The conversation then shifted to Brett Favre's Pro Bowl selection and speculation about his brother Cooper's business ventures. A lengthy discussion ensued about Joan Tuck-Rusky, a Long Island PTA official arrested for allegedly being found half-naked with a 13-year-old boy. Callers, including Lydia, shared their perspectives, and the hosts debated the double standards and media coverage, referencing the Deborah LaFave case.  The segment concluded with discussions of a flash game mocking President Bush and culturally offensive actions globally.

The following segment started with a discussion about cultural eating etiquette, rapidly degenerating into graphic descriptions of a large fecal deposit left by Jimmy in the studio bathroom, using numerous crude comparisons.  This was followed by unrelated news items: Peter Falk's Alzheimer's, the elimination of "gifted" programs in D.C. schools, and the Adam Walsh murder case, with the hosts expressing anger at the details.  Further discussion focused on cultural insults, bathroom hygiene, and a bizarre anecdote about a man defecating in a bathroom.  Guests Greg Gutfeld and a WWE personality arrived, leading to a lengthy discussion about offensive language in comedy, including examples from Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino," and the hosts received and tested vibrating cock rings sent by listeners.

This led to a segment featuring interviews with Joe Francis (Girls Gone Wild), Dr. Michael Baden, and WWE wrestler Maria Kanellis. The show opened with a discussion about the vibrating cock ring,  followed by the interviews. Dr. Baden's fascination with death was satirized.  The Maria Kanellis interview covered her career, a recent injury to an opponent, her Playboy photo shoot, "Outback Jack," a naked man in the WWE locker room, and a staged "Kiss Cam" with intern David and Sam Roberts.  The conversation included discussions about the realities of being a female wrestler, gossip about other WWE personalities, and a flight to Baghdad with troops.

A later segment focused on the inconveniences of using toilets in jail and the military, and a caller, Ryan, expressed his fandom.  Maria recounted an incident involving chocolate milk and other substances being thrown on her by wrestlers. Greg, another guest, needed to leave.  The hosts advertised Ashley Madison and Pajamagrams, debated the meaning of "sachet," and commented on the attractiveness of Kaylee Goncalves' mother.  The show then centered on Sam, a show employee, who had kissed a man on the show, leading to a discussion about his girlfriend's reaction and homophobic slurs from the hosts.  Jimmy then guessed the penis size of interns.  The discussion turned to Sam's participation in previous videos and an infected scab in Jimmy's nose.  This transitioned into a segment where Sam's angry girlfriend texted him, and the hosts proposed various challenges and bits, mentioning the "Tub Girl" video.  Lily, another guest, was introduced, and engaged in increasingly vulgar and sexually suggestive discussions and challenges, including pulling out pubic hair, which led to David consuming a pubic hair (from Danny's anus), resulting in David kissing Danny's cheek.

The final segment detailed escalating dares and stunts.  Sam kissed Danny's buttock, then David kissed Danny's buttock for money.  David refused money to blow on Jimmy's buttock initially, but after some persuasion, accidentally farted while doing so.  A much more controversial proposition to pay David to kiss the "fruit bowl" (the area between the thighs and buttocks) was discussed, highlighting the potential PR nightmare. David ultimately refused this dare.  The segment incorporated unrelated segments, including a “Kiss Lily” bit, with highly vulgar and sexually explicit language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this collab, let's get the show on the road.  Hi, good morning.  Good morning.  A little springy sound.  Yeah, my microphone is vibrating.  Microphone.  I'm trying to figure out all this tax crap.  It just...  Didn't we leave England for this?  Suffice to say, everything's just taxed.  Oh, about 50% more than it was.  Yeah, we're waking up to a whole bunch of new taxes here in New York City and... 
[00:00:30]  Nationally and, you know.  Some of this is national?  I don't know.  I'm sure...  Well, we're talking about Governor Patterson and his...  Trying to figure out the budget for New York.  God, I miss Elliot Spitzer.  He didn't have time to worry about new taxes.  No.  This guy had better things to do, if you know what I mean.  Everyone thought it was, yeah, rah, rah, rah, let's get rid of Spitzer.  Well, guess what we get now?  A do-gooder.  We get a do-gooder. 
[00:01:00]  Mr. Tax and Spend.  Wow.  So, I mean, quickly, I've read about three or four articles on this.  They're taxing us a few dollars here, a few dollars there.  Taxing pin the tail on the donkey blindfolds.  There's not one tax where you're going to go, oh, my God.  It's 4% here.  It's 4% there.  4% on, like, movie tickets.  It's just chewing us apart.  When you renew your license, that'll be an extra 10 bucks, so it's like a little here, 
[00:01:30]  a little there.  But you know what?  In the end...  Does it add up?  Yes, it adds up.  How the hell is the average person supposed to pay for more taxes?  We keep saying it.  People live paycheck to paycheck.  How does this make sense?  Get the money somewhere else.  By cutting things.  Well, they're doing that, too.  They're cutting all over the place.  How does the MTA, the transit authority here in New York City, how do they not make money  under any circumstance? 
[00:02:00]  No one questions it.  I have no idea.  How do they cry poverty?  Every...  I ride the subways every four or five years.  They give you a new subway.  One.  Yeah.  And then the rest of them are crap, falling apart.  And like, I forgot who said it, but every time you go on a subway, it's packed.  Yeah.  So what is the problem?  Packed like what, Opie?  Like sardines.  Right.  No, that's what they do in Japan. 
[00:02:30]  They pack them in...  In Japan, they push in with sticks.  Maybe that's what they need to do is start pushing New Yorkers into the subways with sticks.  Big sticks.  They have actual people that just hang out on the subway and push into subway trains.  Beautiful.  I don't know.  I don't know how they're crying poverty and need to raise more money.  Don't question it, man.  So what they're doing also is taxing the drivers.  Like all those, they want to make people pay over the free bridges now. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Or on the east side of Manhattan.  Yeah.  And a lot of that money will go to the MTA.  Yeah.  I think, well, wait a minute.  Obviously, they're...  I drive.  Obviously, they're mismanaged, but who's going to tell them they're mismanaged?  They're their own entity.  Yeah.  They're their own entity.  No one has to...  They don't have to answer to anybody except themselves.  We've seen how the brass react, and we've seen their faces when they were on strike.  So we know the players. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  Ugh.  So...  Misappropriations.  We wake up to more taxes, and the big one is the i-tax.  i-tax?  They figure out a way, when you download music, to tax that.  To tax your little 99-cent song?  Yeah.  These sons of bitches.  Your 99-cent song is now about, what, $1.06.  See, what I'm saying is a few pennies here, a few dollars here, but when you add this up,  they're taxing cigars now, or we're taxing them more, I should say. 
[00:04:00]  How are they going to tax the downloaded cigars?  I don't know, Jimmy.  These scumbags, just keep your hands...  The economy's so terrible right now.  I know.  They want more.  It's not like everybody's willing to give.  The economy sucks for the people.  Uh-huh.  There's so much mismanagement going on.  Why don't you try to figure that out, instead of trying to get more money from our pockets?  Taxis and bus rides, you're going to pay a little more. 
[00:04:30]  Another 4% raise there.  Like I said, a few pennies, a few dollars.  There's movie tickets, sports tickets.  If you want to get a massage, that'll cost you 4% now.  Sensual massage?  Massage.  Massage and health spa visits, they raise that 4%.  The driver's license thing.  Beer tax is going up.  Wine tax.  And then the downloading of music will now cost you.  Unbelievable.  How are we just sit there and take it? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, what is it?  What do we do?  We're not revolting enough.  How do you revolt?  How do you revolt?  How do you revolt?  It's time for a revolution.  Who wants to get that going?  Yeah, who's going to be the one to whip that up?  A good old-fashioned revolution.  In the United States of America, yeah, okay.  In the year 2008, almost 2009.  That'll never happen.  No.  They could just tax the... 
[00:05:30]  That's what they do.  They tax the crap out of us, and we just sit here and go, okay.  I'm getting a communique.  I believe this is from Danny.  I paid $11 for a movie ticket yesterday.  That shows that I haven't been to the movies in a while.  When did that happen?  And most movies are, what, $12 a ticket?  Easily?  Easily $12, if not more.  So now they want to add to that with more taxes.  I remember when movie tickets went up to $8 in New York City, and people were losing their minds.  Sure.  Like, $8 for a movie, and now what, $12? 
[00:06:00]  $12?  See, they keep raising movie tickets, but they don't raise their service.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I was sitting in a movie yesterday, and I could have been sitting in a movie theater from 1988.  What's the difference?  The chairs suck.  They're still not digital.  They've been promising digital movies for, I don't know, at least a decade at this point.  Still got the flickers.  If you didn't know any better, you'd be like, I'm sitting through a movie, and it's about 1988, I would guess. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  If all of a sudden my mind went blank.  Mm-hmm.  But they keep raising the prices.  When you raise prices, you've got to give the consumer something a little different.  Yeah.  A little better.  Not the same old crap, but pay for it.  Any different from when you were in there watching big?  No.  It's the same thing.  Absolutely not.  And for all the money that they charge you on concessions and the ticket, they could at least hire some kind of staff that could work at a decent pace.  Because I know, like, at least the last 10 or 12 times I've been to the movies, there's been one concession line open that you stand at for 25 minutes because the people behind the counter are goofing around, joking with each other. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And they're just not doing their job.  You would assume that they are trying to be slower than their friends.  Yeah.  That they make a bet, I bet I can be slower than you.  Because they know everyone's in a panic.  They get there a little late, and they know they have, what, five minutes before the movie starts, and they want to get their dumb soda and popcorn.  It's not even that so much.  And they're not even going to help you out.  You have your seats, and saving your seat is a big thing. 
[00:07:30]  I have such stress going to the movies, and always have.  But I hate the idea of trying to get a good seat, and then to keep the good seat.  God forbid I go with some people, and they go, could you save these seats?  I'm going to go to the bathroom, or I'm going to go to the concession day.  And then I turn into this, ah!  Yeah.  And then, excuse me, are these taken?  Yes, they're taken.  Oh, those seats are taken.  Then you've got to be the those seats are taken guy.  Yeah, which isn't fun. 
[00:08:00]  That's it.  That's why I've built my own theater.  No movie theater for me.  My whole goal is to just never leave my house.  You're on your way.  I'm working on it diligently.  You're on your way.  Let's go to Mark and Mastic.  The lovely town of Mastic, that asshole.  We haven't forgotten.  Hey, can we get a Mastic moment today?  I believe there was a nice shooting in Mastic yesterday or the day before.  All right, we'll do a Mastic moment today.  Yeah, perhaps we can dig that story up.  Marky, what do you got?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Just cross over to Throgs Neck and the George Washington Bridge to go to Jersey. 
[00:08:30]  Yep.  I've got to go back to Long Island next.  Yeah.  $37 in tolls, round trip, give or take.  For one day.  Seven.  How are we supposed to pay for this?  And how are people not, like, rolling in dough?  One car, $37.  One guy.  You know how many cars go over that?  And they still can't fix the roadways.  And half these bridges, you don't even know if they're going to, like, you know, collapse as you're going over it. 
[00:09:00]  How many easy pass allows them to have less people hired?  Right.  They're going to pay the same amount of people.  Right, yeah, yeah.  How are we supposed to pay $37 a day to go over bridges for our jobs?  Why isn't this looked into?  Why isn't an accounting done of all of this?  Because, man, you know, you ask questions.  Next thing you know, you disappear.  That's scary.  What about the Verrazano? 
[00:09:30]  You only pay one way, and that's $48 for a truck.  How much?  $48 for a tractor trailer to go over the Verrazano one way.  Oh, you pay for axle?  Yeah.  You know, I got five axles.  You pay X amount of dollars.  But think about it.  A hundred thousand trucks a day go over this bridge.  Dude, that's insanity.  Yeah.  Every day.  Where is this money?  I mean, that's almost shock, shock, you know, paychecks there.  Where is that money?  Maybe back a few years ago. 
[00:10:00]  You know, Wall Street finally got caught with their pants down.  I think some other people need to be caught with their pants down.  Where is this money?  Yeah.  In my back pocket, that's for sure, boys.  And the reason why here in New York we got bridges you can cross for free on the east side,  the reason people use those bridges is because they can't afford to pay to cross those bridges.  It's not fun to go over those bridges to save a few bucks.  It takes you a lot longer. 
[00:10:30]  That's why I take the tunnel.  But now they're going to be, you know, putting up the toll booths for those bridges.  Where?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  The approaches to those bridges are made for no toll booths.  They'll just knock down houses and businesses.  They don't give a crap.  And you know how bad traffic is?  Whatever it takes to get more money in.  You know how bad traffic is with just an open bridge to go over and no obstruction?  Right.  And if they put toll booths there, do you know how bad traffic is going to be backed up? 
[00:11:00]  It's an abomination what they're doing in this city.  In this country, it's just disgusting.  You know, it was never supposed to be where every single person lives paycheck to paycheck.  I understand a portion of society has to do that always.  But now it's like the majority live paycheck to paycheck.  Yeah.  It's not even a question if you're a married couple that both of you have to work.  When we were growing up, you know, if mommy wanted to get a job because she was getting a little bored and a little older, she did that. 
[00:11:30]  But it wasn't out of necessity to, you know, to take care of the household.  Now the kids got to work.  And the kids.  Send the kids.  Oh, now you just send your entire family out into the workforce.  Pimp them out.  Whatever it takes.  Seven years old, get a job, you bum.  Whatever it takes.  Here we go.  Let's talk to Tony the trucker.  Tony, listen to this one.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Tony.  How are you, buddy?  Pretty good.  I pay about $160 a day in tolls. 
[00:12:00]  $160 a day.  How is that possible?  What are you hauling?  Plutonium?  How many?  What do you got?  20 axles?  He's driving one of those missile trucks.  That's right.  Yeah, the Verizontos.  They know how to screw you.  Yeah.  What they do is I got a tandem and I can raise the wheels so they can't charge me because  my wheels ain't touching their roadway.  Oh, is that why you guys do that?  I was wondering about that.  Yep.  Nice.  But they'll still charge me. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, they will.  The Verizontos is the only bridge and I'll tell them my wheels are not on your road.  And you know what they tell me?  I don't care.  Wow.  So you guys found a little loophole and they said, after your loophole, we're going to  still charge you.  That's it.  The guy's bouncing his truck on a unicycle.  Right.  He's going, okay, one axle.  Right.  Hey, Anthony, real quick.  Yes, sir.  You going to the gun show in Pennsylvania this weekend? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, there's a gun show in Pennsylvania.  Yeah, those Pennsylvania gun shows are pretty raucous.  They're fun, huh?  Yeah.  No, I'm not going.  A lot of assault rifles for sale this time.  I don't doubt it.  I'm picking up a couple myself.  Have fun, my friend.  Buy ammo, too.  Don't forget.  All right.  Let me tax the crap out of that.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  What's up, Stryker?  Morning, boys. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, they built a toll road on the east side of Denver a few years ago.  Now, every exit, even if you're continuing straight through on the highway, every exit, you have to stop and pay $1.50.  And plus, if you live in the three counties the road travels through, you have to pay an additional $10 on your license plate until the road is paid for.  And now they just came back and said, oh, well, we're not making enough money on the road because nobody uses it. 
[00:14:00]  So, we may have to raise your license plate taxes again.  Brilliant.  We're just a bunch of poohahs in this country.  Simple as that.  How does this get done?  And we just sit there, oh, okay.  Yeah, we slowly just fell into this.  And we've been riding the same roads for decades.  And what is different, really?  What are you getting for your money?  Oh, well, they pay for the schools.  They pay for this.  Hurruff, hurruff.  We're eating it.  We are eating it.  I do the math sometimes when I'm just, like, going through some of these toll booths. 
[00:14:30]  Just the cars in the vicinity.  I do some quick math in my head and go, wow.  Yeah.  Just this group of cars are making a few thousand dollars.  Yeah.  Fortunes.  And that's just a mere 30 seconds waiting to go through the tolls.  I do a quick count.  Where is it going?  Just a quick count.  Let's see.  Well, I guess we got the Governor Patterson's budget thing that everyone's going to be talking about today.  It's in every single paper. 
[00:15:00]  The blind gov.  The do-gooder.  I miss Elliot Spitzer.  Elliot Spitzer.  There's a little story in the paper about Elliot Spitzer today.  He was apparently, he's doing some online magazine review.  For what?  A column for Slate something.  Yeah.  But what does he review?  I don't know.  Movie reviews?  Restaurant reviews?  I guess wherever they send him.  Escort reviews?  Well, funny you say that.  He was in a place that used to be a massage parlor.  We had been at that place called Happy Endings. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  We weren't there as a massage parlor.  It was a party.  It was a party going on.  It was an old school massage parlor.  And they kept the showers.  Yeah.  And the little rooms.  And the Yankee Cranky rooms.  And they made it into this club.  It's actually a pretty cool spot.  Trendy spot.  Right.  So, Elliot Spitzer was there.  And somebody from one of the financial papers asked him how he likes his new gig.  And he said, it sucks. 
[00:16:00]  I used to be governor of New York.  He just said it right to the guy.  Hey, it sucks.  I say we start the campaign.  Bring back Spitzer.  He's not taxing us like this.  Well.  I wasn't a big fan of the guy.  But this Patterson, he can't take a blind joke.  And he sure knows how to tax.  I don't know how we fell into such huge trouble.  I mean, the whole world economy.  Because I'm like, let's just put it back the way it was before it was broken.  Right.  Can't we all just agree to go, okay, let's put it back the way it was before it was busted. 
[00:16:30]  Because no one's accountable for their actions in this country.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like, what happened that screwed it all up?  And no one wants to be the guy to try to figure it out.  So, they go, oh, wow, there's obviously major issues here.  But I'll let the next guy deal with that.  Yeah.  I want to look like a hero when I'm the governor or the mayor or the president or the senator.  You know, no one really wants to, you know, do the heavy lifting, as we like to say. 
[00:17:00]  Here's what Patterson's saying today.  Governor Patterson was well aware that just about anything you can name,  from music downloads on your iPod to non-diet sodas,  will be taxed under his proposed new budget.  But the taxes are only about a third of the money.  Take a look at these lists of cuts that you'll be facing.  Yeah, places like hospitals, nursing homes, public schools.  How did we get in a situation where they're cutting funds for hospitals, schools, nursing homes? 
[00:17:30]  And taxing soda.  No one saw this coming years ago?  Yeah, what happened?  And was able to do a little adjusting then?  Hospitals, nursing homes, public schools, and in many benefits for state workers.  A lot of those will be cut.  And then you'll be paying more for things like this.  Non-diet sodas, clothing, shoes, gasoline, SUNY and CUNY college tuition, 
[00:18:00]  fees at the DMV, and admission to state parks.  And that's just the beginning of a very, very long list.  That's pretty much an average person's life right there.  It's everything.  Right.  You add all that up.  Like, okay, I do that, I do that, I do that, I do that.  A few dollars here, like I said, a few pennies, a few dollars, a few dollars.  I don't know, man, what they expect from us.  Everything.  They expect us to pay through the nose.  I know we have to take a break. 
[00:18:30]  I've got to go to Tony Miller Place.  This is unbelievable if it's true.  Tony, go ahead.  What's up, guys?  My best man, he's a local three electrician.  He's worked on a Triborough Bridge a half dozen times.  He told me about a year ago, he's in a counter room.  It's a big, huge room.  It was averaging $113,000 every 10 minutes.  $113,000 every 10 minutes.  And where?  Every 10 minutes.  Where?  The Triborough?  The Triborough.  Is that possible?  Well, you've got to figure if it's 40 tow boots, where they get $8,000, it's $320,000 every 
[00:19:00]  minute.  I don't know where it's got to go, but it was somewhere between $107,000 and $113,000.  He was just sitting there, he was working that whole day.  Stunt brain, let's back up with this guy saying.  Well, if he's doing every $110,000, that's $650,000, $660,000 an hour.  Holy cow.  Where is that money, really?  Where is it going?  If someone would please see where that is.  By the way, the Triborough Bridge is not called the Triborough Bridge anymore.  I know.  It's the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, which they spent in this economy, where they're taxing 
[00:19:30]  everything, $4 million to change signs and let the people know that it is now called the  Robert F. Kennedy Bridge instead of the Triborough Bridge.  In this economy.  How about we start there?  Why does it cost $4 million to change signs?  To change the name of a bridge.  Why?  Why don't you sell that?  Why isn't that the Microsoft Bridge? 
[00:20:00]  Right.  Why don't we get some money for that?  Sell it.  What about the Adolf Hitler Kennedy Bridge?  Poor little Adolf Hitler and his little cake.  Did you see the picture of him?  We've got to talk about that.  Look how adorable Adolf Hitler is.  We've got to get more.  He's adorable.  Yeah, we've got more to that story after the break.  The phones are just licked.  Adolf Hitler Campbell.  He's so tussleable.  All right. 
[00:20:30]  Wow.  There's a lot of good stuff on the phones.  Okay.  877-212-0&A.  It might be tough to get in now, but that's the number for maybe a little later.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, we're kind of deciphering this tax thing that Governor Patterson has thrown at us today.  All right.  Pretty expensive.  And Tim ran in here with some figures. 
[00:21:00]  Lincoln Tunnel here in New York, 120,000 cars a day.  Yeah.  GW Bridge, 120,000 cars a day.  Holland Tunnel, about 100,000 cars a day.  Midtown Tunnel, 80,000 cars a day.  Throgs Neck, 55,000 cars a day.  And the Whitestone, about 110,000 cars a day.  Those are the main bridges and tunnels that get you in and out of New York, right?  You've got the GWB in there?  Yeah, GWB, 120,000. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  We did some math.  Quick math.  Give or take a few mil.  Shit.  We figure that they're making about $18 million a week on us.  $18 million a week.  On us.  And that's not enough for what?  What do they need more for?  What?  And that doesn't include the subways and all that other stuff.  Right, the buses, the subways, everything else.  That's just the tunnels and bridges.  $18 million a week.  Where is that money? 
[00:22:00]  And the people you see that are running these things aren't the ones that are making a fortune.  The toll collectors that are being knocked down in numbers anyway because of Easy Pass.  The conductors, the bus drivers.  These aren't the guys making the fortunes.  It's these unseen upper echelon of the transit department that sit in their offices, have redundant jobs, and make a fortune. 
[00:22:30]  What are they needed for?  I don't even know what they do.  Ouch!  How many people do you need to run a bridge or a tunnel?  A tunnel.  Do you need somebody to say, hey, the cars I'm going through today, are the gates going up and down, and the money's being...  Okay, good.  Stay on it.  Like, what does this guy do?  I don't know.  They're using the right tunnel for the right direction?  Good.  Good.  No problems.  You got the cones set up so no one goes into the other lane? 
[00:23:00]  Good.  Good.  Good.  My job here is done.  It's amazing.  But we just sit there and take it.  It's our problem, really.  Yeah.  We just sit here and take it.  We do.  How long, though?  How long do we take it?  Until it breaks down a little too much?  Man, we did this break 10 years...  Depression.  We did this break 10 years ago.  We're still just taking it.  The thing is, we're in massive recession right now, bordering on depression.  Right.  And people in the know are saying, this doesn't look like it's going to end anytime soon. 
[00:23:30]  No.  So how long before people start going, I'd love an accounting of that, but I'd like to  know where this money's going?  Because we give, we tax, you know, we get taxed, and we don't even question where it  goes.  You ask anybody, they don't know where this money's going.  So how about an accounting of it?  Do you think we could get like a Wall Street thing going, where all of a sudden it just collapses  on itself and be like, hey, what the...  Now we've got to take a good look at you. 
[00:24:00]  Take a good look where somebody starts digging around in there and finds out where this money's  going, where this waste is, and start cutting some of that with some of these idiots' throats,  perhaps.  $18 million a week.  You don't see the roads getting that much better.  Every once in a while they do a little paving or something, right?  Yeah.  What do we...  The tunnel, they scrub it out once a week for us.  For what reason?  I don't know.  Who gives a crap to some...  Never bothered me.  There was soot on the walls of the tunnel.  Now there's this machine that goes through there every day to justify somebody else's 
[00:24:30]  paycheck.  I would love to know how much that machine costs to run every day.  It's custom made just for that tunnel.  Right.  Like the Midtown Tunnel has a machine that goes...  It's got little brushes on top and everything, and one squirts water, the other one...  It's a mobile car wash.  A little soap.  What the hell is that about?  We don't need it cleaned.  We really don't.  Park that thing.  Park it.  I guarantee that's millions of dollars right there. 
[00:25:00]  Just to have a clean tunnel to go through.  Let's say hi to Rob in Pennsylvania.  Rob, how are you?  What's up, guys?  Happy Hitler Days.  Whatever.  Thanks, you creep.  Hey, over here in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, they're trying to tax us.  If you own your tractor trailer and you're parking it at home, they want to tax you for  parking it at your house.  Wow.  What are they trying to say about that?  How do they tax it? 
[00:25:30]  Is that enough that you're trying to make money with the fuel tax and stuff?  Right.  Now you're going to be at home not making money getting taxed for it.  Because you're trying to save a few bucks and you put your rig in your front yard or your  backyard or whatever.  Absolutely.  That's exactly what's going on.  They wonder why there's no truck drivers out here anymore.  Amazing.  Danny said that the MTA gave themselves raises in April.  Yeah.  Could you imagine having a job where you just sit around with your buds and go, let's give  ourselves a raise.  You want a raise?  I want a raise. 
[00:26:00]  Harumph.  We all want raises.  Pat on the back for each other.  That's why you're not allowed to give yourself a raise.  Yeah.  You would do it every week.  There should always be someone that has to decide that for you.  You can't just say, I want a raise and then give yourself a raise.  Let's try it.  By the way, inside Patterson's budget was a raise for judges.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All the taxes that got raised, there was a small raise for the judges, but that's just  dumb right now.  For what?  Yeah.  Why do they need a raise? 
[00:26:30]  Let's say hi to Will.  He's, I'm assuming, an NYPD guy.  Will?  Yeah.  NYPD?  Yeah.  You guys rock.  What do you got, Will?  I just read in the paper, like, not even two days ago, Bloomberg wants to spend $8  million to build new bike lanes in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Him with his goddamn bicycles.  But here's the other side of it.  Go ahead, Will.  He's planning to lay off 6,000 cops.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  He's a Bloomberg.  Look.  He's a tax-inspend liberal who happened to become a Republican because I think he couldn't 
[00:27:00]  get on the Democratic ticket.  He couldn't get on the ticket.  Right.  That's what he is.  He's a dumb liberal.  Look, if you want bike lanes, okay, maybe it's a good idea.  I don't even know.  I don't carry the way.  But maybe you put that off and you take care of the cops until maybe the city's a little  healthier.  How about we keep the cops on board?  Because New York City, actually one of the safest cities in the country.  Used to be.  That'll change.  But it still is.  Yeah.  Well, you start getting rid of the cops. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  You get rid of the cops and all of a sudden it ain't safe anymore.  We're dopey shock jocks and we understand this better.  City gets a little healthier, then you build your dumb bike lanes.  In the meantime, take care of the cops.  You get rid of the cops.  I don't feel like getting hit over the head with a brick anytime soon.  A nasty element starts taking over again.  But you can ride your bike.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, you can.  And I enjoy riding my bike, but I don't need bike lanes when I hear that the cops are  being cut.  I don't need some thug clothes lining me off my bicycle.  Right, right. 
[00:28:00]  Because there's nobody protecting.  All right, man.  All right, well.  Unbelievable.  What about the $600 it costs you if your car gets towed?  I never understood that one whatsoever.  Yeah, I just got a nice $115 parking ticket.  For what?  I believe I was too close to a crosswalk.  For a couple of seconds, I did the old park, get out, get back in. 
[00:28:30]  They nailed me.  Oh, yeah.  You know, obviously, guilty as charged, but I just sent the money in.  But it's just, wow.  Who's going broke here?  The money is pouring in.  I disagree.  Guilty as charged.  We never agreed to that law.  That law is not hurting anybody.  These people aren't representing us anymore.  Right.  It's one of those things they put into place just to make more money for the city.  I don't know when representatives stopped representing us. 
[00:29:00]  Like, it happened over some time.  They were supposed to be the voice of people.  You couldn't have, like, an entire community show up at some town hall to discuss their issues, what they wanted.  So you pick somebody that then goes there with your best interest in hand to represent you.  Right.  So you don't have a riot on your hand when all these representatives get together to plead their case for their people that they're representing. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Well, somewhere down the line, it kind of changed where nobody likes what these people are doing.  So who are they representing?  Who are they representing when nobody's agreeing with their policies?  They're rogues.  They're on their own, and they're under the guise that they're doing our bidding.  You know, I get a lot of crap for not voting. 
[00:30:00]  This is the exact reason.  I hate them all.  I hate them all.  Because they don't look out for your best interest.  I don't rah-rah for any politician.  No.  I might hate one a little less.  Yeah.  I almost said like one a little more.  No, it's actually hate one a little less.  They're all the same person.  By the way, we didn't continue with the math, Anthony.  Jeff in Staten Island, he's a mathematician.  So you take the $18 million, right?  And now you have to times it into the old 52 weeks. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Making up a year.  Give or take a few million again.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  We're looking at $936 million, all those bridges and tunnels that we just mentioned.  $936 million a year.  This is before any of the taxes we've mentioned, any other revenue that the city brings in.  It's just cars coming into the city.  That's almost a billion dollars a year.  Okay. 
[00:31:00]  Where is that money?  How are you going?  Where is that money?  Hey, that doesn't include the subway.  I know.  It doesn't include the buses.  It doesn't include...  There's unbelievable amounts of money, and we want to know where it's going.  And they're getting more money from us.  Can you please tell us where it's going?  Yeah.  I'll try to explain it somehow, like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Never.  Jackass.  Here's one more thing. 
[00:31:30]  Brian, go ahead.  Hey, how's it going, Brian from Queens?  The best bracket is this New York State lottery.  Out of every $2 that's collected, $1 goes back into the payoffs, and then only $0.13 of that other dollar goes back into the schools.  Yeah.  It costs $0.87 to run the state lottery.  You understand?  Yeah, they make it sound like the lottery's doing all this good.  Yeah, it's paying for schools.  Oh, I'm at my Islander games, and they're raring the lottery and what they do, and here's a check. 
[00:32:00]  They walk out the big check before the game, and it's like $10,000.  I'm like, who are you kidding?  You made a billion dollars today alone.  How about this?  How about they just build...  $0.13...  Sorry, Jimmy.  $0.13 go back into the system.  That's wonderful.  The best thing is I work in the school system, and the new thing now is they're putting all  these daycares in the high school, so Laquisha can learn how to count the toes or something.  What?  Daycare for the students?  No, daycare for their kids. 
[00:32:30]  That's what I mean.  Daycare for the students' children.  Correct.  Holy God.  How...  They can learn how to count toes.  Oh, my God.  Why don't they just put a casino in New York?  Put a casino in Texas.  I mean, for real.  Load it up.  Why not?  All right, thank you.  Why not?  Here's a guy that used to work for the Verrazano Bridge.  Tommy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  I work on the Verrazano.  We do almost 200,000 cars a day, and that's...  I shouldn't even say cars, that's just vehicles. 
[00:33:00]  A quarter of those, a tractor trailer's paying like $58-something a pop.  That's true.  Yeah, the traffic isn't always just cars.  So our number was...  Yeah.  As we figured out, it's almost a billion a year.  We're way off on the Verrazano Bridge already.  That bridge is already making way more than we just figured out.  Think about that.  All the tractor trailers that go over pay a lot more.  We're talking about the minimum is what the cars pay.  Oh, so this thing is...  So it's at least that.  We just popped over a billion easily now.  The Verrazano was not a $200,000 a day times...  Let's just say $10.  So you got $2 million a day. 
[00:33:30]  That's another $100 million plus on there.  Yeah, so we're over a billion dollars now.  With our dumbass.  From what I was told, only $1 out of $8 stays with our agency.  The rest goes to MTA.  The rest goes to MTA.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Oh, here we go.  This old story.  Joe and Shirley.  Toll money goes to paying the bridge off.  Sorry.  Shouldn't we have paid the bridge off years ago?  How old are these bridges? 
[00:34:00]  I look at old documentaries in New York City, and it's in black and white.  And the cars are something you can't even relate to.  Yeah.  I mean, they show cars driving through these tollboots, right?  Biff Tannen's car.  Where even collectors don't have these cars.  Yes.  They're like one stage above stagecoaches.  Yeah.  And you're telling me they still need to pay for these bridges?  They got to pay them off?  What are they made of?  Gold?  That means mismanagement, my friends.  Of course it is.  If they're still trying to pay off the bridges, that means there's a mismanagement thing going on. 
[00:34:30]  But it doesn't matter.  I mean, we'll move on with our radio show, and we'll do this break another 10 years from now.  Nothing changes.  Nothing will happen.  Need to revolt.  Somehow, you know, the whole thing has to collapse on itself, and then maybe, like, some positive things will happen.  Let's go to Joe in Queens.  Joe.  Hey, how are you guys doing, man?  Listen, I listen to you guys, and you guys really are telling it like it is, and more people should listen.  And you guys are right on.  You guys are really great. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you, sir.  Just helping out the little guy.  Well, this whole tax thing has really hit me today, because I know, I mean, I'm lucky.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I don't need any more money.  I'm fine.  I'm set.  But I come from a huge family, a huge extended family, and they all live paycheck to paycheck already.  And now you add all this other stuff on top of it, I don't know how the average person is going to afford to live.  I don't know how they're supposed to do that.  Oh, you're going to live, but your whole time is, you know, working jobs to pay bills. 
[00:35:30]  That's it.  When do you get to actually have fun and not worry about money?  Yeah.  Average parking meter in New York City makes $10,000 a year.  How much?  A parking meter.  I used to live on 73rd Street or 71st Street on the Upper West Side.  There was easily at least 10 on that block alone, at least on one lousy block. 
[00:36:00]  The whole city is just a money-making venture.  The entire city, no matter what you're doing in it, somehow is costing you money, yet they can't make things work.  And that's why I hate the mayor.  I hate the governor, because they're looking like, wow, we're going to try to figure out the city's problems.  No, they're not.  No.  Because to really figure out the city's problems, they've got to ask some pretty intense questions.  Yeah, they've got to start calling people to tasks.  But they avoid all that and go for the easy targets, which is us. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  The taxpayers.  The ones that don't complain.  You want to figure out this mess?  Why don't you start asking the tough questions?  Like, why are the bridges and tunnels taking in well over a billion dollars a year?  Do an accounting of the MTA and find out where all this money is going and why.  And see if you can chop off some of these executives that just are redundant, that do nothing. 
[00:37:00]  Love to see it, but we won't.  Completely mismanaged.  No one wants to acknowledge that.  How many parking meter attendants, how many of them are being fired?  They're going to lay off 6,000 cops.  I want to know how many of those ticket meter maids they'll lay off.  They'll never lay those people off, because those are the ones rocking around your neighborhood,  finding you doing something wrong so they could make more money for the city.  They'll never get rid of those people.  They were supposed to get rid of tolls in part. 
[00:37:30]  Shut up.  Yeah.  I know the guy read that somewhere, but that's not happening anytime soon.  It'll never happen.  They keep bankrupting themselves, I think, to justify needing the tolls.  How do you get, how do you, if you're a business and you're making over a billion dollars a year,  and you're bankrupt, you're not allowed to be in business anymore.  The CEO's out the door.  Right.  You're not allowed to continue on. 
[00:38:00]  No.  Unbelievable.  So that's what we're waking up to today, tax hell.  It's on the front page of every newspaper, every effing newspaper.  Getting the royal screw today.  It's just starting, that's for sure.  And they're happy.  They're like, well, just, you know, taxing people that download music, that'll raise $15 million a year.  Yeah, about that.  Thanks.  Well, that's wonderful.  $15 more million out of our pockets.  Well, Joe Biden would call it patriotic. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, well.  Paying our taxes.  It's patriotic.  Yeah, well, great.  Good for him.  Wait, because, yeah, wait until that kicks in.  You think these state taxes are enough?  Wait until Barack gets in there and Joe Biden,  and they start taxing the crap out of everything on a federal basis.  Wait for the new boss, which is the same as the old boss.  All the change.  Yeah.  Please.  We need our change.  Change we need.  How about we save our change? 
[00:39:00]  Ah, this Governor Patterson.  Ugh.  More blind jokes.  That's what we need.  More blind jokes.  Maybe it'll distract them and it'll stop taxing everything.  877-212-ON-A.  We'll continue with this, but we got other things as well.  We got the PTA mom with the 13-year-old boy.  I love the story.  That's a good one.  You know, obviously, you can't allow this to happen, but, well, we'll explain.  It'll be the same bit we do a lot. 
[00:39:30]  I was watching TV last night, and I noticed a couple things about the show I was watching.  What show?  Is that the tease?  First 48.  First 48.  Love it show.  Love that show.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  We're fired up today.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning to everybody.  Hi.  I want to apologize for my hair, Ant.  I didn't notice that you said something, and then I started laughing hysterical.  Well, I felt like I had to say something, because I'm getting kind of looks from people 
[00:40:00]  around the show, and then I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror, and I went,  wow.  I look like that center.  I don't know his name, but he has the horrendous, like, hairpiece, and it's way up in the air  and stuff.  Maybe someone could come up with a name.  He's got a full head of fake gray hair.  It was a little puffy, puffy this morning.  And the only reason I bring it up is because of the looks, and I don't want people to think  I'm, you know, going completely insane. 
[00:40:30]  But what happens when you get up early, you take your shower, like everyone does, and  my girl has all these hair products that you don't even know if it's a shampoo or a conditioner  anymore, because they come up with fancy names.  Or lotion.  Yeah, I don't know what I used on my hair.  Fabric softener.  It's definitely not shampoo.  Dude, I did that once.  I accidentally grabbed lotion, because there's lotion in the shower for, like, shaving legs  or something.  Who knows?  I don't know why do women need lotion in the shower.  There's 8,000 bottles, and there could be shampoo and conditioner. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  And soap.  That's it.  Right.  But there's so many bottles.  And I grabbed lotion and put it in my hair thinking it was conditioner, and it might as  well have just been lard.  Yeah.  I should have just put lard in my hair.  Coming with a greasy head of hair.  Oh, it's fantastic.  It doesn't really matter, obviously, but it is a good little break, because what happened  in just naming something shampoo and naming something conditioner?  Yeah.  Like, there's names on these bottles in my shower. 
[00:41:30]  I have no...  So I have to guess.  Because I think they're trying to fancy up the fact that it's shampoo, so they come  up with some...  Rose petal emulsion.  Oh, yeah.  Something.  What is it?  Yeah.  Where do you put it?  On your feet?  On your head?  Yeah.  Your crack?  Right.  Where are you putting this stuff?  Where are you putting this?  I have no idea what I used on my head.  I just hope it doesn't make my hair fall out even more.  You know, it would really suck.  Did you exfoliate your scalp accidentally?  It would be funny if you just sneezed, and every hair of your head just tumbled up in  front of you. 
[00:42:00]  Then I'm going to have to go with the hair plugs, like my buddy did.  They're not plugs.  They're individual follicles.  Yeah.  Whatever you say.  My what?  How's your wig?  It's not a wig.  It's not a wig.  Hey, really fast.  There's three really interesting sports things going on.  Yeah.  Okay?  I'm a big hockey fan, and this Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL, he was at a luncheon  yesterday, and he was talking about Sean Avery, of course, the star's forward. 
[00:42:30]  Talking about his crude remarks, the sloppy seconds.  Most of us are on board with this, right?  Yes, certainly.  Gary Bettman yesterday says, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't want to have to explain  to my 12-year-old daughter what he said, Bettman said at a luncheon.  So don't.  How about you explain that to your 12-year-old daughter?  How about you go, yeah, it's just a guy saying something crude.  It means that you're dating somebody after somebody else has dated them.  Right.  There you go, 12-year-old.  Next.  Then what does the sloppy mean, daddy?  Right.  Well, it all depends on the nationality of the original gentleman. 
[00:43:00]  A lot of times, if he's a black gentleman or a Dominican gentleman, he'll leave things  in quite an array.  Like, your mother enjoys that, for instance.  Sweetie pie.  Yes.  Calling her all nice little things.  It comes down to the hypocrisy.  Well, angel cake.  Yeah.  It comes down to the hypocrisy, though, because it's hockey.  People are beating the crap out of each other.  How do you explain that to your 12-year-old daughter, you dope?  Yeah.  And I love the hockey fights, but, I mean, what are you trying to say here?  And I'm disappointed by the stars. 
[00:43:30]  The team decided not to have Avery back, that they didn't want him around.  Did they want him around for a reason?  That wasn't an excuse to get rid of the guy.  Well, the guy is pretty much an a-hole, but, I mean, you've got to support the whole sloppy  seconds thing in this PC world we live in.  And then you've got Phil Mickelson being called a – can we say the word?  No, not that kind of thing.  Come on.  Are you kidding me?  Well, Tiger Woods' caddy, he's a real ass, too, the Steve Williams. 
[00:44:00]  Winning that caddy tournament, that's important.  If you know anything about Steve Williams, he's Tiger Woods' caddy from New Zealand.  And he likes taking cameras out of fans' hands.  Oh, yeah?  And he likes to throw them.  He threw one fan's camera into a lake during a tournament.  Wow, good one.  I think he did something with a cop once.  I forgot that story.  Did he push him or something because he thought the cop was getting too close to woods?  Whatever.  He's a real – he really is an a-hole. 
[00:44:30]  Those Aussies love a good brawl.  They love to mix it up.  He's a New Zealander.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, he's probably like one of the Maoris.  Yeah.  He's probably just been drinking for years.  He's a major problem.  Yeah.  Fist fights with wildlife.  This guy's the savages, man.  Fist fights with wildlife.  I don't mess with New Zealand people.  They have a lot of problems.  Well, if you know anything about golf, it's a known fact that Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson,  those two camps, don't get along whatsoever.  They play nice for the TV cameras, but they really don't like each other. 
[00:45:00]  And Steve Williams took it to the next level.  I wouldn't call Mickelson a great player because I hate the – and the word rhymes with brick.  With a brick.  Yes.  Yes.  So he said –  It's what somebody does with their fingertip when they try to get a little blood sample.  There you go.  I hate the –  Blank.  That's the big firestorm?  Yeah.  And that's the firestorm.  Wow.  It's a whole article today.  This story has legs. 
[00:45:30]  And unfortunately, because we live in this weird world, Tiger Woods is going to have to fire his caddy.  And they're really good friends and all that.  Tiger has won 13 out of 14 majors with this caddy.  And he's going to have to fire him.  That's just how this goes in this world.  I don't understand this new world we live in, but that's what's going to happen.  Because he called him a blank.  A blank.  A brick.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  The expletive he used rhymes with brick.  Yeah.  It's like we're adults in an adult world, and that's the way we talk. 
[00:46:00]  And that was in the paper he said it like that.  Yeah.  In the paper, they should be able to print the actual words.  We've been cleared.  You can say that.  Prick.  Prick.  Well, I think people know by now.  If they don't, God.  Go listen to Z100.  But isn't it amazing, though, that the paper they have to go – rhymes with brick.  Right.  What are we doing?  We're babies.  We really are.  We're just little coddled – what are we, children?  Nation of little babies.  Silly.  This is what –  Me, me.  Here's Steve Williams' rap sheet. 
[00:46:30]  2004 U.S. Open.  Marks go over toward the gallery and angrily confiscated a camera from a fan, an off-duty  police officer, no less, and later kicked a camera that was raised to the face of a newspaper  photographer.  Another time during a Skins game event, he took a camera from a fan and tossed it down  a steep bank, allowing it to roll into a lake.  Golf needs guys like Steve Williams to liven up that boring sport. 
[00:47:00]  Did the guy have to take a drop on another camera?  Right.  He just kind of drops it.  And there's this dope George Willis who writes for this paper that I absolutely hate.  He has all the charm of a rhino, and he acts like a goon.  So, yeah.  Real people will act like a goon sometimes.  What do you want?  You know, we can't be robots.  This crap is going to happen.  And Steve Williams already acknowledged that, you know, it was probably the wrong thing to 
[00:47:30]  say.  But he also said, look, we don't – I, he was talking for himself, I don't like the  guy.  What's wrong with that?  That's fine.  So, you watch.  Within a day or two, Tiger Woods is going to have to fire his caddy.  I hope not.  We're making – I think he'll make him apologize, unless this guy is such a – he's so hated.  But –  Well, I've been watching this story.  I didn't think it was worth bringing to the show.  And I think he apologized yesterday.  But they're still writing about it, and the articles are getting bigger and bigger.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Bigger and bigger.  That's so ridiculous.  Williams is saying that – said he didn't think his comments would be made public and that  the whole thing was taken way out of context.  He didn't mean any harm.  Of course.  Yeah.  They should let it go.  They should let it go.  Of course.  Of course.  It's like – these guys are dropping C-bombs or saying, like, horrible Michael Richards  things at these – it's like – it's like that you can kind of say, all right, the  guy's got to go.  But a prick or – who was the other one that we just talked about that got in trouble? 
[00:48:30]  Sean Avery.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Sloppy seconds.  Who doesn't love sloppy seconds?  That's wonderful.  God, I hope the Islanders pick up Avery.  That would be huge.  Yeah.  We need an A-hole on our team.  We need something.  I love the A-holes in hockey.  Love them all, even if they play against my boys.  Hockey needs more A-holes.  And then really fast, just to wrap up the sports thing, have you been following the  Stephon Marbury thing here in New York?  No.  They decided that they just don't want him on the team anymore.  I really don't really understand it fully, but they've sat Stephon Marbury. 
[00:49:00]  I did hear that on the news.  And then they basically told him that they don't want him around anymore until they figure  out how to pay him out, and they're negotiating a buyout in his contract, right?  And he wants to be such an ass to the Knicks, and he wants to continue being relevant in  the NBA.  Last night, he bought a ticket to watch the Knicks in L.A. just to kind of rub it in  their face.  Just to be there. 
[00:49:30]  Because they basically said, we don't want you around.  We don't want you around the garden anymore.  You have to, like, go away.  He's a paying customer.  So he has a house in L.A.  He's hanging out out there, and the Knicks, you know, go and play the Lakers.  Stephon Marbury bought a ticket to the game.  And now it's a big story in the paper today.  I don't know what that's about, either.  Like, why is he?  I've read a million articles, and I can't really figure out what the whole thing comes  down to.  You know, he's not a...  I've read he's not a pleasant man. 
[00:50:00]  He seems like a douche.  But, yeah.  So he decided to just buy a ticket to watch the Knicks yesterday just to rub it in.  I also heard, apparently, if you're watching the Knicks game on Time Warner Cable, it froze  up with, like, four minutes left, I believe.  Oh, really?  And, yeah, it was a pretty exciting four minutes.  Oh, wonderful.  And a lot of people were very angry.  And when that happens, why aren't we allowed to pay less for our monthly bill?  Yeah.  Why is it always working the company's favor for all this stuff? 
[00:50:30]  I never understood that one, either.  If you complain, a lot of times they will give you money off.  Like, it's like your cell phone companies.  Yeah.  But most people...  Like, I don't complain.  I'll be...  Like, my calls get dropped.  I'm like, why complain?  Who'll listen?  But that's my favorite expression.  I say that at the post office line.  Yeah.  But if you call up, a lot of times they'll knock some money off.  I used to commute.  I used to do the Long Island Railroad.  And I would be rushing for trains after our afternoon drive show.  So I couldn't get a ticket ahead of time.  So when you're on the train, you have to pay...  How much is it extra? 
[00:51:00]  Like, $5 extra just because you're getting your ticket on the train.  Like, those guys have a lot to do on the train.  You're hassling them to a point that it costs an extra $5.  With this hole puncher.  Right.  Yeah.  All they have to do is hole punch.  I would love to know how much money those guys make to hole punch.  But if you get on a train and you can't find a seat, you're still paying full fare.  I never understood that.  Yeah.  You should be able to go to that ass that's punching your ticket and go, look, I can't  find a seat, so I'm going to pay you less because I have to stand for an hour. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Why does it always work in the favor of the company?  I think they're excused.  And I hate it, too, because a lot of times on a plane, let's just say your video model  doesn't work or the meal that you're supposed to get isn't available or whatever.  Why are you not paying a little bit less when you're like, or the seat, a lot of times  you're on a plane.  Right.  And like Continental has a lot of times those little teeny headrests, things that can go  left and right, and they break all the time.  Right.  So like, why aren't you charging me less when I'm not going to be as comfortable as this  person is?  But the other thing is we're guaranteeing you a safe train.  I'm guessing that's what they're...  Whose big fat head is it that's banging against those things that breaks them? 
[00:52:00]  I just can't understand that.  When you go to flip those little headrest-y things up and then it just flops down.  Yeah.  It doesn't stay in position.  Well, the company would argue that they're being inconvenienced, so if you're being inconvenienced,  then you should be able to save a few bucks.  It's simple.  A few shekels.  People don't know how to do business.  It's logic.  I was in a restaurant the other night.  A friend of mine and I were eating, and this is the second time this has happened to me  in this restaurant.  And we had to move away from the wall because a roach just crawled up and then just sat there 
[00:52:30]  and just kind of looked at us, and he wanted to stare down.  We moved.  He was.  And the food came and we ate it.  I mean, we were already there, but...  Ugh.  I can't eat at a place if I see a roach.  I know they're there.  I'm not naive.  But if I see one, I'm done.  I'm done.  It's the second time it's happened to me in this restaurant.  And the third bug incident, like one time, every time you sit against the wall...  There's a Casa de... 
[00:53:00]  Ugh.  What are you eating?  It's on 70th Street in Broadway.  Literally?  Wait, what place?  On the street.  Wait, that's close to me.  What place that I'm never going to?  Luxembourg Cafe.  And I like the food there.  But one time there was ants.  But I'm like, ants could kind of happen.  It was in the summer.  It was right by the window.  Maybe ants could kind of happen.  An ant wouldn't bother me.  What's wrong with Anthony and his friends?  Because they were drinking and being rowdy and passed out on the floor.  All right.  The boo was for me.  No, no.  But the boo was for me, too, because I...  All right. 
[00:53:30]  Let me...  All right.  I saw your plane going in, and I still got in the back seat.  I took the ride with you.  Why would...  Ollie in the big bopper.  I knew it was going to crash, and I hopped on board.  Let me explain why my joke sucks so bad.  Why would Anthony hang out with just Anthony's?  Yes, a bunch of ants.  Right.  Hey, ants.  And why would it bug me?  Like, I love ants.  Why would I not want to sit with them?  Don't squish me.  We go back to...  I just got on the plane.  We go back to the NHL for a second.  Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, good morning, fellas.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hey, Bruce.  I was just wondering why they get...  How they got the nerve to suspend people for saying things that they don't want to explain  to their kids when they accept money from advertisers like Viagra and Cialis, and then I got to explain  to my six-year-old what a four-hour erection is.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yep.  And it's in the commercials.  And you know what?  This is where I stand.  You should be able to say sloppy seconds.  I don't care.  The fight should get bloodier.  You should be able to have Viagra ads. 
[00:54:30]  I don't care.  But if you're the commissioner and you're saying, how do I explain this?  There's a lot of other things that are tough to explain to a kid that has something to do  You should absolutely be able to say it all.  I mean, I explain to my kid like an adult.  Yep.  You know, it's kind of difficult, but you go through it, you plow through it, and you move on.  But why would you suspend a player in the violentest sport, aside from football maybe,  that's ever been played for, say, in sloppy seconds?  You raise a great point about what they will accept from the advertisers, too. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  It's like, when you look at...  This is all sports.  When you look at the alcohol ads and the amount of deaths contributed to drunk driving or domestic violence  or child abuse or all these things, how come no kid ever said, well, so-and-so drinks and gets beat up?  Why are you...  How come they aren't advertising in the arena, Daddy?  Like, why do you have to explain that to your kids?  And about the Viagra thing, if you have to explain that to your child, remember, a picture's worth a thousand words.  That's in six years. 
[00:55:30]  Okay, guys.  Bye.  All right.  It's all just a joke, man.  Man!  Look what is happening with this radio show.  There's certain things we're not allowed to do anymore, but then you look at the list of advertisers,  you're like, oh, all right, yeah, okay.  Yeah, that makes sense.  And I'll just leave it at that for now.  And the problem isn't with the advertisers.  The problem is we just stop breaking our balls.  Right, right, right.  People do what we do.  It's a loan.  And the people don't understand, if you allow us to do maybe some of these things that you took away from us,  it certainly could help the ratings, which means you would get more advertisers and more money for the ads. 
[00:56:00]  They don't understand.  They don't understand.  And if we're doing sports really fast, Brett Favre elected as backup quarterback in the Pro Bowl?  Yeah.  Well, part of it comes from fan voting.  So there might have been some big fan support.  It has to be because of the fans.  I think there's quarterbacks out there that had a much better year than Brett Favre.  And you've got the Manning brothers.  Well, the Mannings are in. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  That family can throw a football.  How about that, huh?  Except for the third guy.  Is he the brains or is he the swish?  There's a third brother.  I don't know.  That's got to be awkward around here.  The Danny DeVito character from Twins.  Yeah.  It was triplets.  God, how do you live in that family?  Two out of three are like star quarterbacks.  He's gone and tossed the ball around.  No.  I'd rather just sit here and try to fiddle with the books.  You think the family makes believe that his life is as important as the two star quarterbacks during Thanksgiving? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, and what have you been up to?  Well.  And then he says some blah, blah, blah stuff and they've got to make believe it.  Wow, that's really impressive.  That's interesting.  Well, let's talk back to the superstars.  So what else is happening at the firm?  Well, we're done with you.  Back to football talk.  Dad will tell stories.  The two sons will tell their Super Bowl stories.  Right.  Going blind from the Super Bowl ring glare.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He just made floor manager at J.C. Penney in Oklahoma. 
[00:57:30]  Stupid idiot should hang himself like an officer to gentlemen.  And mommy and daddy have to treat them all equal, but we know better, right?  He's probably like a financial whiz.  He probably makes like, you know, $750,000 a year.  But he does.  Find out what the third Manning boy does.  Dude, he couldn't be a failure.  He has to be successful somehow.  You know what?  He has to be.  The funniest thing would be if he was a complete failure.  You know what, though?  What could he possibly be up to that equals, like, winning Super Bowls? 
[00:58:00]  Nothing.  I'm sorry.  I don't get it.  It doesn't matter.  Mike got him.  He can't.  What?  Cooper Manning.  Yeah, I know his name's Cooper.  It's better to say the third Manning.  Well, he has a spine problem.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  So he can't play sports.  Oh, boy.  So what's he do?  Proving God has a sense of humor, by the way.  I'm trying to find it.  Wow, a spine problem.  Was he an athlete ever?  Yes.  Oh, he got hurt.  He was a high school athlete, but he has spinal stenosis or something like this.  His job is a question mark.  Oh, that sucks, because I bet you that gene is just you got it, but you don't have it. 
[00:58:30]  He probably had it, too, and then got hurt.  Oh, that stinks.  Wait, did he get hurt, or was that more genetic?  I'm trying to find it.  Sounds like a genetic thing.  Sounds genetic, doesn't it?  It did sound genetic.  I don't know.  What the hell do I know?  He is, let's see, Cooper Manning.  What does he got here?  You won't see him in the Super Bowl.  I like my gig here, he said, but they don't see what his gig is.  Oh, wait.  He is a part owner of an energy firm that deals with oil and gas stocks.  I wonder who the other owners might be. 
[00:59:00]  Other siblings of superstar athletes.  Yeah.  Ted Taylor.  Ted Montana.  Hey, there's Larry Staubach and me.  Oh, my God.  Hey, let's call Marv Dorsett.  How old am I?  Can't I find a new guy? 
[00:59:30]  Oh.  Very nice.  Oh, there's Sullen Joe Green.  Let's call him.  Sullen Joe Green.  What the hell, Jimmy?  There's slightly angry Joe Green.  Right.  Hey, there's full head of hair, Al Zato.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Hey, Fleetfoot Stingley, what do you think?  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, 40 years ago today, what happened in sports?  Jimmy, 40 what?  40 years ago today, what happened?  The Yankees allowed their farm system to grow.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The, um...  Don't cheat, Ant.  No, not.  We don't like cheaters on this show.  The Jets clinched to go to the Super Bowl.  All right.  We'll tell you after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Damn it.  Opie and Anthony living after midnight. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, right.  Living after nine, maybe, with this dumb job in these hours.  Uh, 40 years ago today, Anthony.  In sports.  In sports.  Don't cheat.  What'd you come up with?  Oh, you did the Jets thing, right?  I thought it was something to do with the Jets.  I know, uh, they were, weren't they Super Bowl bound?  Or was that the 69 into, you know, because the way the year goes... 
[01:01:00]  Gets a little confusing.  It gets confusing because they start the season in one year and then the Super Bowl is in the next year.  So, in other words, I don't have a goddamn clue.  Well, now that I made everyone, uh, sit through commercials...  Yeah.  This happened actually yesterday.  Oh.  Oops.  Wow.  I hear the FUs out there.  Yesterday was the 40th anniversary of the Eagles fans booing Santa. 
[01:01:30]  That famous, uh, sports story.  Oh, really?  40 years ago yesterday.  I thought that was a story from, like, the 80s or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  No kidding.  That was...  68?  Wait a minute, no way.  I'm, I'm calling Bravo Sierra.  That would be 1968.  They booed Santa in, like, the 80s.  I think they always booed Santa.  Maybe that was the first time they booed Santa?  Maybe that was the first time.  When was the first time they kicked him in the groin?  And threw batteries at him.  Right, and set him on fire. 
[01:02:00]  Gotta love Philly sports fans.  Oh.  Don't like their teams, but I love, uh, the fact they're bad boys down there.  They're wonderful.  What do you got there, Travis?  Yeah, uh, December 15, 1968.  The Eagles, who played their home games at Franklin Field, were losing the last one of the season  against Minnesota.  They were going to be 2-12, blah, blah, blah.  Fans were disgusted.  Can you sound a little more excited?  Yeah.  Well, uh, yeah.  Uh, they detested the team's starting quarterback, Norm Sneed.  Oof.  What's wrong with Norm? 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  Besides having an awful name.  Yeah.  Uh, so yeah.  It was 40 years ago.  All right.  Did you look that up in the sports almanac?  No, I don't have the sports almanac.  Ah!  Ah!  You do.  40 years ago, Monday.  Sports almanac.  All right, so two days ago.  Mm, yeah.  Gray's Sports almanac.  It's a terrible movie. 
[01:03:00]  Back to the Future.  Wonderful.  You did finally see it.  Out of your mind.  Recently, anyway, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  By the way, I'd like to, uh, give a, uh, congratulations to Danny.  If you know, Danny came up with the idea of the secret show that we did based, uh, solely  on Back to the Future where we played the episode, uh, the episode, the movie, and commented  on it while people synchronized at home and also watched the long.  Uh, well, a certain website. 
[01:03:30]  Crunchgear.  I think they're fans of the show.  Yeah.  They write about the show a lot.  Has, uh, given that, uh, what is it?  One of the, the.  The.  Top honors.  Top honors.  The 2000, what's, uh, 2008 in satellite radio.  Yes.  Uh, it made the top five, uh, best moments of the year.  Not top five.  The number one moment was the Back to the Future secret show you guys did.  Very nice.  So how bad could it have been? 
[01:04:00]  Very, very good.  Well, you guys got to do another one.  Exactly.  Speaking of movies, I watched The Wedding Crash, but I'd never seen it.  No.  And I watched it.  I just wanted, people that liked that movie, I hope you all fall into a ditch.  I didn't laugh.  I actually laughed once.  It had been fun.  The rest of it, it was terrible.  What part made you laugh, Jimmy?  When he was sitting there talking to the priest about what a secret, I'm a psycho too, baby.  He was talking about the chick.  And he said, come on, father, you don't like to be sitting there, kind of melt out the table. 
[01:04:30]  I thought that was pretty funny.  The rest of it was her, Owen Wilson and that stupid, your hands on the hips.  You really don't like Owen Wilson, do you?  Why?  And his stupid cracked lip and that juicy, kind of handsome, quirky, all he makes with his lips.  Boy, you really don't like him.  And he should just fix his nose at this point.  Yeah, he should, with a shotgun. 
[01:05:00]  And then he's awful and he's stupid.  It looked like he had a spray on tan.  Yeah.  And his big, charming smile.  His big, dumb, charming smile.  Hey, look.  What's your problem with Owen Wilson?  He always looks like he's kind of leaning back and peeking.  Like, he's always got that little, like the handsome guy, like just lean back.  What do you call that when, like, guys do that with their lips?  Percy.  He has Percy lips.  Thank you, Jimmy.  He's pursing his lips.  He's pursing his lips.  Stop pursing your lips. 
[01:05:30]  You ever see Bottle Rocket?  I've not, no.  That's an Owen Wilson movie you should check out.  You ever see Bottle Rocket?  Yeah, I think I did.  Was that a Wes Anderson film?  What's his name?  Who's the big, famous, like, indie director?  Is it Wes Anderson, or am I, like, out of my mind today?  Anybody?  Uh, yes.  It is Wes Anderson?  Very good.  That's, uh, yeah, Bottle Rocket was a, that was a fun little movie.  Then Owen decided to go mainstream and do the Hollywood thing, unfortunately.  And he's a good actor. 
[01:06:00]  Although he was good in Meet the Parents.  What other movie was he good in?  Uh, huh?  He was in The Cable Guy.  Was he really?  Yeah, he plays the, uh, the boy, well, the, Jim Carrey's, uh, ex, no, I'm sorry, I'm  screwing this all up.  Matthew Broderick's ex's, uh, ex goes to date some new guy.  The new guy is Owen Wilson that Jim Carrey subsequently eats up in the bathroom of their  restaurant.  Yeah.  That movie's great.  He's got that face with teeth. 
[01:06:30]  Jimmy hates him.  Boy, Jimmy does not like him.  He's got that, you know, his big toothy, like, he'll deliver his dialogue and he'll actually  smile.  And I'm not saying he sucks as an actor, but I don't like that he does that.  Like, he's so aware of just like what a scamp he is.  He's just, he's just a rogue scamp.  A scamp.  You know, a couple of guys going to the weddings acting nutty.  So you're not going to go see me and Marley?  Awful.  You're not going to see the dog movie?  No.  With him and Jennifer Aniston?  Me and Marley? 
[01:07:00]  No.  Listen to about Bob and they have the same thing he did at the end.  Terrible.  I did nothing but watch multiple episodes of 48 Hours, that show where they take cops  and they got like 48 hours to kind of get a good lead on a murder, on a homicide.  And I watched, I swear to you, it had to be from 5 in the afternoon until about 10 o'clock  at night.  I was watching this. 
[01:07:30]  And one thing that struck me is they always got to go and tell the next to can, which  is, and it's the cliche thing.  The cop is always driving there.  They show the cop driving.  He's like, yeah, it's the hardest part of the job.  This is just the first 48.  That's what it's called.  Yeah, it's the hardest part of the job.  You know, I'd never get used to this.  I never like it.  And all I was thinking is Kenny.  Kenny, I just was thinking of Club Soda Kenny going, ah, yippee, another one. 
[01:08:00]  I get to tell someone their loved one's dead.  He would love that gig.  Oh.  He would love that one.  How many times did that goon come to someone's door?  Hello, your son's dead.  I don't want to be the bearer of bad news.  You know, it's my job.  I have to.  He loves being the bearer of bad news.  Oh.  I've never met anyone that loves it more than Kenny.  And some people just seem to accept it.  Like, there was this one girl. 
[01:08:30]  She was found murdered in this park.  And the family was just like, well, she ran with a bad crowd and had drugs and things like that.  And other people just completely, ah, they lose their mind.  My baby.  My God.  My baby.  My baby.  And that's what I got to also bring up.  I scoured that show for a white criminal.  I couldn't find one. 
[01:09:00]  So that means whites aren't committing crimes.  Dude, I don't know what it is.  It's a show.  It's not crimes.  It's murders.  Murders.  Okay.  It's a show is basically really brutal murders.  And these cops, it's always like they got to bring in some guy and it's some, you know, hip-hoppy guy.  And they talk to him and I didn't do nothing.  It's always the I didn't do nothing.  And then they just wear him down. 
[01:09:30]  And they wear him down to the point where it's like, well, you know, we're trying to help you here.  We're trying to help you.  If you tell us what happened, maybe the circumstance, and then they feed him.  They go, maybe the circumstances that it happened in wasn't so, um, so brutal.  I know you didn't mean to do this.  And then they go like, yeah, well, my 85-year-old grandmother was in my face, you know, and they got to justify killing her. 
[01:10:00]  But I don't understand it.  It's just one after another hours I watch this.  So what are you saying, that whites don't commit murder or that it makes better TV to show the black people committing murder?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  I was just kind of commenting on what I saw last night for hours I watched.  And there's two, two murders per episode and for hours.  And every single one of them was perpetrated by a black gentleman. 
[01:10:30]  Even the, the white people that get killed.  It's like, uh, well, you see this, uh, white chick she found dead.  And then, uh, they go to the, uh, house, uh, and, uh, find out her boyfriend's a drug dealer.  And they show, uh, the mug shot.  And you're just like, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I think they know who did it.  You guys watch depressing stuff when you're not here.  No, that's great stuff to find out how they figure it out and stuff.  You do a whole marathon of that?  Oh, the cops are fantastic in those, uh, those shows. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  And they're just so, as a matter of fact, they're like, yeah, look at that.  Looks like took one to the head.  Ugh.  And then he goes, ugh, one to the eye.  And then they're just laughing and joking in the car.  Those, those homicide guys have got to have the, the, the darkest sense of humor ever.  Because they go from just looking at butchered bodies to kind of just making jokes.  Yeah.  Just hysterical.  I don't know how people do those type of jobs.  Yeah, but I love those shows.  God love them.  I watch them all.  I watch that, that. 
[01:11:30]  I watch the, uh, the A&E ones.  Forensic files.  Cold case files.  I like the cold case ones.  There's some guy, you know, like, thinks he got it.  Imagine 40 years goes by and you've lived your life and you go, I totally got away with this.  Yeah.  Wonder, wonder who that could be.  Hey, you open the door and there's cops.  What?  You found what?  A 70-year-old filling is in their hands.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy. 
[01:12:00]  You got me.  One hair in a baggie.  It's amazing.  A Ziploc bag.  Yeah.  We have, uh, we have DNA stuff now that we can figure out more.  That's what they did.  They got this one guy.  He got him in the room and, uh, they're interrogating him and he's got, uh, he's got a stab wound in  his hand and his, uh, his auntie was, uh, stabbed to death and they're questioning him  and they go, what happened to your hand?  Oh, I heard it.  Uh, I heard it somehow, whatever.  And then they just, uh, take DNA off everything, the knife, the door handles, everything else. 
[01:12:30]  And they find his DNA at the murder scene.  It's like, all right, you're done.  You're done right there.  And still, I didn't do it.  And then they told the, uh, family.  So that was twice as bad because then they tell the family that the auntie is dead and  that the nephew did it.  So it's like a double loss.  But the, the guy sitting there is going, why'd he have to do it like that?  Why'd he have to do it like that? 
[01:13:00]  No, it's fantastic.  It's a great show.  That's insane to me that you can raise your, your own murderer.  Yeah.  That always freaked me out.  It's like a retroactive tumor.  Right.  Yeah.  Cause you had good intentions when you, when you brought, you know, babies into this world  and you had no idea that you were raising your own murderer.  They come back and kill you or your, your brother, your brother's kid comes back and  kill you.  It's just bizarre, man.  This wasn't my intention when I decided to have a kid.  Uh, white guy last night, Ant, you missed it. 
[01:13:30]  John in Boston.  What?  Hey, John.  Yo, hey guys.  How are you?  Hi, John.  Hey, hey, hey, Ant.  Hey, last night, Ant, man.  I watched the same episode.  That 19 year old girl was shot in a black girl.  It was a very sad story.  But in the same episode, it was the one before, I think.  It was a white guy.  He killed two like Colombian guys that were unarmed.  Uh, that was like 58 years old.  Big fat guy.  Just shot them both dead.  Oh, wasn't he Hispanic?  What?  I think he was Hispanic. 
[01:14:00]  Uh, I don't know.  Yeah.  Uh, he was pretty white.  He was pretty white.  Well, you know, I'll give him, okay.  I'll give him one white guy.  Yeah.  I watched every episode of that show.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what I'm trying to, uh, I don't think I'm trying to make a point.  I'm just observing that, you know, some people might call the show racist, saying that they  only pick certain things, but I don't know.  They're saying it's because of the towns they, uh, they film in.  Jim in Jersey.  Well, they gotta get murders. 
[01:14:30]  Jimmy.  So they go to the towns where there's murders.  Yeah, Jim, what's up, man?  Yellow.  Well, Jimmy, you gotta, let's go.  What's your point?  You're on that?  Memphis, Miami, St. Louis.  Look what it's got to film.  Geez, where are you?  Where are you, Newark?  I heard the siren going.  It is the neighborhoods, but the thing is, you gotta, you gotta go where the murders are  if you're having a murder show.  That was probably the latest one they're filming right there. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  The guy's like, oh, I can comment about this show.  I'm on my way.  Right.  Hey, um, we gotta change gears because we got this PTA, uh, lady.  Isn't this stuff, the Baldwin, uh, PTA, uh, uh, teacher, official, what, what is it?  Uh, I have no idea.  She was, uh, I know what she did, but I don't know what she was.  She was one of the, yeah, she was a PTA head.  PTA head, found half naked with 13-year-old boy, and, uh, the windows were up. 
[01:15:30]  The Hopper Valley PTA.  Yay.  Was that her?  And the, uh, and the, uh, windows were all fogged up.  They both, uh, were naked from the waist down.  Best part to be naked.  I was thinking about this.  I swear to you, this is the type of thing I, I, I dreamed about as a kid.  Yeah.  That this would happen to me.  Of course.  Of course.  But if it's, it's a, it's a weird double standard, uh, because if it's an older guy with a 13-year-old  girl, creepy, oh my God, uh, a lot of outrage. 
[01:16:00]  Arrest him.  13-year-old boy with, like, a teacher.  Obviously, you can't allow this to happen.  Is that happening more, or is it just being reported more?  I think it's a hot story to report on.  Because, I mean, it's, it's, it's, we all find it, we all find it a little titillating.  A little titillating.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  That's why they have these stories front and center for you.  Mm.  You don't want to admit that, but it's a bit titillating.  Yes, it is.  Prominent Long Island PTA official is facing some serious charges involving a teenage boy. 
[01:16:30]  Joan Tuck-Rusky was arrested after allegedly being found half-nude in a car with a 13-year-old  boy.  Baldwin Middle School students.  Her Joe Dirt haircut.  Wow.  She is awful.  She is really going to jail, this one.  Yeah.  She's not getting that treatment that, uh, the, the.  You gotta explain, though.  Lefebvre.  Yeah.  If you're hot, you don't do as much time.  We did the whole, uh, we did that bit, too.  Yeah.  You should have a basis from Wasp.  Wasp. 
[01:17:00]  Baldwin Middle School students and their parents were abuzz.  A PTA mom arrested with an 8th grade boy, both naked from the waist down in the backseat  of a parked and running Nissan Pathfinder.  Oh, my God.  A shock?  I've known them this long.  I've lived here for 22 years.  It's gotta be devastating for the family.  Wait, can I ask, like, she went, a shock?  Which meant she was, like, responding, like, how do you feel about this?  Yeah.  Who would go, oh, yeah, we kind of figured that was happening.  Yeah.  Why does the media ask questions you didn't know the answer to? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Are you surprised?  No.  Surprised.  Not at all.  I mean, it's kind of economically not very feasible to leave the car riding with gas prices  as they are, and environmentally unfriendly.  Is the family really devastated?  Yeah, really.  I'm really asking that question.  I don't know.  I would say no.  Really?  They're not.  I don't think the father is.  Maybe the mother's a bit devastated.  Look at the difference between those two.  Holy mother of God. 
[01:18:00]  There's Deborah LaFave.  Yeah.  And the new one.  The new one's gonna get life.  She's, yeah.  She's going to prison.  LaFave.  Firing squad.  Right.  LaFave, the judge was, like, slipping his phone number.  Yeah.  You're fine.  Just go.  You're looking at 10 to 15.  Well, let me slip this your way.  You're fine.  Man, you could go now.  Who are you?  Teacher?  You went to school?  All right.  Take her away, pervert. 
[01:18:30]  LaFave, like, the face way better than the body.  She's all right.  She went through some phases with the body.  And the body was.  I'm looking at the picture that I'm sure a lot of you have seen.  On the motorcycle?  Yeah.  With her bikini, and she's on a motorcycle.  She's a body like James Gump.  She's not fat or anything, but she's a body.  James Gump.  It's a weird shape to her body compared to that amazing face of hers.  I've lived here for 22 years.  It's got to be devastating for the family of the victim. 
[01:19:00]  This father's son goes to school with both the alleged victim and suspect's daughter  and is incredulous at word that 44-year-old Joan Tukruski,  vice president in charge of fundraising for the Baldwin Middle School PTA,  was charged with endangering the welfare of a 13-year-old boy.  I am shocked.  She has kids of her own.  I mean, how can you even think?  What's her last name?  Tukruski.  Tukruski.  Yeah, it's a rough one.  Tukruski.  Tukruski.  Oof.  That's like E-Rock's alter ego's name. 
[01:19:30]  Tank Hankerous.  Tank Hankerous.  Right, right.  Tukruski and Tank Hankerous.  I got a Tukruski trombone one time.  That's what Ruski does when he dresses like a girl.  Hey, Tukruski.  Oh, that deserves a slice of melon.  It sure does.  Dipped in gas.  She made a rookie mistake, by the way. 
[01:20:00]  Rookie mistake.  They got caught in the school parking lot.  Wow.  What are you doing?  Go drive somewhere.  It's lunch.  Drive two minutes.  Right.  It was in the rear of this elementary school.  Drive two minutes and improve your odds.  It was in the rear what?  Here.  It was in the rear of this elementary school.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  I thought we were going to have some trouble with that story.  It was in the rear. 
[01:20:30]  Whoa.  Wow.  You know, sometimes details, you don't have to get so detailed in the story.  It was in the rear.  Oh.  Wow.  Jiminy Cricket.  Well, apparently the kid, the kid did, you know, didn't want to take any chances.  Yeah.  He said, this is what you're going to have to do.  Yes.  That's why they were parked there.  She couldn't sit to drive.  She's blowing up her inflatable donut.  But I see the little wheelbarrow inner tube. 
[01:21:00]  It was in the rear of this elementary school parking lot where patrolling officers say they  noticed the foggy and steamed windows of the SUV.  They approached and knocked on the window.  And what they observed was a woman in her 40s.  And they also noticed a boy who appeared to be a teenager in the backseat as well.  And as the officers asked questions, they noticed that both of these individuals were  not closed from the waist down.  At first, the boy said he was 18.  Later at the hospital, admitted being 13, but claimed he and the PTA mom were only kissing. 
[01:21:30]  She obviously had some kind of problem.  Could be a midlife crisis.  It could be...  Families were informed the Baldwin School District is cooperating fully and is working  to maintain a normal and calm school environment for all students while police investigate.  The investigation is ongoing.  If it's determined that a sexual act took place, charges could be upgraded from a misdemeanor  to a felony.  Felony?  Yeah.  They were only kissing. 
[01:22:00]  They didn't say where, though.  All depends on where that kiss goes.  Kissing the dirty penny.  There are some pretty dirty spots to kiss.  Let's go to Jamie in Jersey.  Like the rear of that elementary school.  Jamie!  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Hey.  Still going good.  All right, yeah.  I just want to say, you guys, do you think the kid's a victim or not here?  Because, I mean, they refer to him as a victim, but it sounds like he wanted to do it, and 
[01:22:30]  you know, good for him, right?  I know how I used to dream when I was 13.  I wouldn't be considered a victim.  I wouldn't consider myself a victim if I was 13 getting some action like that.  And I'd be the braggart.  I would be telling everybody.  The problem is that she looks like Steve Adler.  Yeah, that is the problem.  Yeah, she really is not one of those hot ones.  It's not a hot teacher thing.  No. 
[01:23:00]  You know, but you say, you know, that I don't think the kid is a victim, and, you know,  there's a little outrage.  Yeah.  A little outrage, but come on.  Yeah, because, you know something?  When the kid grows up, there's going to be so much, especially the parents, there's going  to be so much poured on there, and so much made of it, that the kid will wind up having  problems because of that more so than what happened.  And you've got to just kind of blow it off and go, all right, that happened.  Hey, whatever.  Move on.  And don't all of a sudden stick the kid with a shrink and try to work through this abuse 
[01:23:30]  that you got, because then the kid grows up and goes, oh, my God, I was abused as a  child.  I was like, shut up.  Yeah.  Enjoy it.  Maybe we could get, hi, guys, to give her opinion on this.  Ugh, Lydia.  Hi, guys.  13 years old.  Weren't you thinking of this stuff?  I was doing that stuff.  Lucky you, man.  Lucky you.  Me and my brother. 
[01:24:00]  See, the thing is, I didn't like much, much older women.  I never have.  So that girl, Buzz, of course, that you might remember, was 19 when I was 13.  Right.  So, you know, that's when we hooked up.  But then my brother, who was a year and a half older than me, was banging this 30-year-old  that lived down the road.  And we were hanging out over her house. 
[01:24:30]  And how old was your brother?  I'm sorry.  My brother, 15, something like that.  That's pretty close to the story we got today.  He's banging the 30-year-old.  Yeah.  And then, so we were all over the house, hanging out, and then Joe suggested that we do the  old switcheroo halfway, you know, through.  We, you know, say that we got to get up, go to the bathroom, and me and him kind of switch.  Nice.  And I was like, nah.  No?  Why not?  Because I wasn't into the 30-year-old mother of two. 
[01:25:00]  I was into Buzz and her giant cans.  God, you were picky at 13.  At 13, I would have went...  I wasn't picky.  I was petrified.  I would have went...  At 30-year-old.  I would have went...  13 years old, I would have had no problem going ugly old abroad.  No problem whatsoever.  None.  Buzz used to come by before I left for school.  Like, I would get...  I would be groggy.  I'd open my eyes, and Buzz would be there. 
[01:25:30]  And all she would say is she wanted to do something to me.  Like, I didn't have to do anything.  So I would just kind of lay back.  Wow.  And that was before school.  Before you go on to seventh grade?  Yeah.  And then I would go to school.  Oh, here's Lydia.  Ah, Lydia.  Hi, guys.  Our residents shrink.  Hi, Lydia.  So, Lydia, why is this a problem?  Well, I mean, she is really horrendous. 
[01:26:00]  Don't you feel bad for this boy?  I think he's going to get teased.  So, Ian was such a...  See, you're not...  Well, he went with her.  She wasn't...  She didn't, like, you know, kidnap him.  That's the problem with broad shrinks.  You don't understand the mind of a 13-year-old.  I really don't.  I think that there's probably something wrong with the poor boy to want to be with a woman  that looks like that.  I don't know.  He's just looking to get, you know, his you-know-what to do you-know-what. 
[01:26:30]  That's all.  But I certainly think she took a lot of advantage of him.  She's a very sick woman.  Well, I'm not even...  Yeah, she, you know, but...  But, no, I don't think...  This is just one step above, like, taking care of yourself.  That's all.  Who cares?  Yeah.  He wasn't looking for a relationship or...  He didn't care that she was ugly.  He's like, wow, live girl?  I'm 13.  I only get to see this on my computer.  That feels, you know, feels the same. 
[01:27:00]  Feels better than your calloused hand.  Yeah.  Just don't look at her face.  Oh, awful.  I don't think that they make a big deal of it unless there are some symptoms of depression  or anxiety, trouble sleeping, or something like that.  That'll all be because of the parents.  Yeah.  Oh, you're supposed to have trouble sleeping.  They'll wake him up in the middle of the night.  Are you having trouble sleeping?  Yeah.  Dummies.  Danny just found a story...  I'll give him a high five. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, I think he's a hero among his peers.  I really do.  Not really.  She's awful.  She's awful.  They'll probably think it's cool just because it was awful.  I think 13-year-old boys think it's cool.  Oh, they'll laugh their asses off.  Who will need some treatment is this woman's daughter who goes to the same middle school.  That could be a problem.  Yeah, there you go.  The woman does?  Yeah.  Embarrassing.  The woman's daughter.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Lydia. 
[01:28:00]  By the way, the phones and instant feedbacks definitely agreeing with us big time about  how we were thinking at 13 years old.  Yeah.  That's all you're thinking about.  This story came in June, and we missed this one.  Teacher 60 arrested for sex with teens.  60?  Now I'm starting to have a little bit of a problem.  There's a problem.  The teens were 17, so there was a 43-year difference.  But 17, you don't think pedophile?  You just think, like, that's just inappropriate. 
[01:28:30]  That shouldn't be a jail sentence.  That's inappropriate on the kids' part.  Yeah.  I know we have to take a break.  One more clip, though, there, Stump Brain.  Channel 11 here in New York.  This was great.  Yeah, they went to the house.  Jimmy, you hate this, right, when the reporters go to the house to get the comments from the people?  Yeah, unless it's something that they think they're actually going to garnish information or garner information.  They never do.  Well, listen to the great comment from the reporter after you listen to the gentleman he's trying to question. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, they found her husband.  Yeah.  Like, he doesn't have enough stuff to deal with.  Yeah.  He has to deal with the dumb reporter.  You, Joan?  Joan's daughter?  Get off my property or I'll sick my dogs on you.  Get off my property or I'll sick my dogs on you.  I'll sick my dogs on you.  By that, he means his wife.  She is awful. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, good one.  Yeah.  I'll sick my dogs on you.  Right now.  Get off my...  I'm on the sidewalk right now, sir.  Oh, Anthony!  Government property!  Government property!  Government property!  Government property!  You vote government property!  Government property!  Wow, you could still do that?  What an immature little douche.  Government property?  I'm on the sidewalk, sir.  Government property!  Government property!  What an ass!  Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a!  I'm on the sidewalk right now, sir.  You're on my property!  I'm not on your property. 
[01:30:00]  My children got a hard enough crime right now.  Do you want to give us a comment?  Go away.  Is there anything you can say in defense of your wife?  Go away!  No comment!  Go away!  Please, I've got children.  This is not children.  Go away!  Go away!  I have my house.  I think my daughter is wrong.  Right, Shadow?  Okay? 
[01:30:30]  Good boy!  Have you separated from your...  Yes, sir.  Have you separated from your wife?  What a brave reporter, huh?  Like, he's going to answer anything at that point.  Like, he's going to turn around and go,  Oh, okay.  After I said I'm going to sick my dogs on you,  get away from me,  get away from my house,  leave me alone.  Are you separated?  Oh, let me sit down  and give you an exclusive.  Yeah.  What a brave reporter.  That'll get you to CNN, buddy. 
[01:31:00]  Let's go to Twinner from PalTalk.  Twinner.  Hi.  I just wanted to say,  you know how when people call up  if you make fun of retail kids?  And, like,  a parent of a retarded kid  will call up and say,  Hey, it's not right that you're doing that.  Sure.  Right.  I think it's the same with this.  If you guys had a...  Like, say it was a girl,  you know,  that was found in the back with a guy.  I have a 13-year-old girl,  and if I found a man in the back seat 
[01:31:30]  of a car with her,  there would be no doubt  that he would be,  you know,  he would be dead.  Twinner,  I agree with you.  We said exactly that.  There's a double standard  that it would be creepy  if it was a 13-year-old girl  and an older teacher,  but...  Yeah, but...  I'd feel the same  because it would be my son.  Right.  And I'm just saying  that you guys would feel the rage  deep down inside of you,  whether it was your son  or your daughter,  and it...  I think you have to be a parent  in order to realize... 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, I probably would feel different  if I was a parent,  but I just know how I was thinking  as a 13-year-old boy,  and I would be like,  wow, this rocks.  That's all I'm saying.  But anybody who knows me,  I'm 39,  and I date,  you know,  in the 20s,  so I,  you know...  Wow!  No, but I'm saying,  like,  as long as it's legal,  that's fine,  but there has to come a time  when, you know,  you have to pay attention  to the law,  and the reason why,  you know,  there's an age standard there, 
[01:32:30]  like 18 or whatever the hell it is,  it's because kids  don't know any better,  especially at 13 years old.  I mean,  that's just disgusting.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Twitter.  Okay.  Rob in New York,  he writes,  would you rather have your wife  cheat on you  with an adult or a kid?  Wow,  that's a good question.  Let's see.  I would say...  Oh.  That's rough.  That is a rough one. 
[01:33:00]  Well,  the adult is more of a challenge to you.  The kid kind of more means  she might have mental problems.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  that's why I'm thinking  the kid might be better for you.  You know,  you're leaving regardless,  but for your own self-esteem,  maybe the kid,  because then you could say,  yeah,  you're a kook.  Yeah.  And I think if it's an adult,  you might think there's more  of an emotional tie  because, you know,  they have some common ground.  Hmm.  All depends. 
[01:33:30]  Is he on the basketball team?  Because that's a problem.  All right,  we've got to take a break.  Don't have time,  unfortunately.  Lee in New Hampshire,  kid won't have any trouble sleeping.  He just got...  Ah,  yeah,  puts you right to sleep.  Tom in Iowa,  I have a 13-year-old daughter.  It's totally different  if it's a guy.  Yeah.  Joe in Oceanside,  I agree.  It's awesome the kid got...  13-year-old JC,  we love you, JC,  but we don't have time.  Why did he have to get  an ugly girl?  You should have picked  a cute teacher.  Matthew from Virginia, 
[01:34:00]  best part is  the kid didn't want this to stop.  Joe the trucker,  I have a son,  if this happened to him,  I'd give him a high five.  See?  High five!  And that's it.  Opie and Anthony.  Thanks.  Is this a Christmas song?  It's Kiss,  let's go.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:34:30]  Can I pour this real quick?  Oh, yeah,  go, Jimmy.  Go, go, go.  I have a regatta show  in Atlantic City,  a third one is being added,  Saturday's sold out,  the 17th,  Friday there's a few tickets left,  and a Sunday show  the night before  Martin Luther King's birthday  is being added  on Sunday,  January 18th  at the Borgata.  Tickets go on sale  Friday morning  at theborgata.com.  So, this Friday,  10 a.m.,  tickets for my third show  on sale.  I got an announcement, too.  Ooh.  I'm selling my  Babe Ruth ball.  How much? 
[01:35:00]  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure how much I want,  I'm not sure how I'm going  to sell it,  but I'm selling my  Babe Ruth ball.  Oh, yeah?  Finally?  Finally, yeah.  I've been holding on to it.  I don't know what to do with it.  Give me 800 bucks for it.  800?  All right,  we'll start the bidding at 800.  I want a little more  than that,  but that's a nice  opening bid  for my Babe Ruth ball.  The Bush story.  There's a Bush shoe game  that has  some people outraged. 
[01:35:30]  Horrible.  Every time there's a tragedy,  some smart  gamer out there  comes up with  a horrendous,  awful game.  It's a bad flash game.  Flash game.  Thank you, man.  Yeah.  And then the media  jumps all over  like everyone's  running out  to play the Bush shoe game.  Yeah.  No.  Maybe for a few seconds.  Because it's an awful game.  Yeah,  it's really stupid.  You have to shoot  the shoes 
[01:36:00]  out of the air  before they hit  the president.  Yeah.  But it kind of looks  like you're shooting  at the image  of the president.  Yeah,  and news reports  on the controversial  new game.  Yes, controversial.  We all saw this.  The outrageous  shoe-throwing incident.  The size 10 disc  dished out  to our American president.  But now,  talk about adding  insult to injury.  Here comes the internet  with an especially  distasteful,  some might consider,  shocking viral video  called Bush's boot... 
[01:36:30]  Shocking.  Why is everything  shocking?  It's not.  And just  outrageous.  When it isn't,  just isn't.  Who's shocked?  I don't know.  No one.  I've ever met.  That friggin'...  Alright,  the bottle,  the jar.  Yeah.  That was shocking.  Two girls,  one cup  first time I saw it.  That was shocking.  Yeah.  That,  the game, 
[01:37:00]  not shocking.  Not so much.  Not so much  shocking-ness.  Viral video  called Bush's boot camp.  It's sweeping the web.  Published reports  say players  of Bush's boot camp  take on the role  of a gun-toting  security agent  and must shoot shoes  out of the air  before they can  hit the president  and players use  their mouths  to aim and fire.  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just a stupid game.  This game will be  hot until Friday.  Yeah.  Who cares?  I'm outraged.  Like Dan said,  a flash game,  no one enjoys 
[01:37:30]  flash games  more than  five minutes.  They're horrible.  They're just like  pop-ups to me  when they're on  a web page.  Yeah,  well,  some websites  make you play.  Try to shoot  this little mouse  that's going  back and forth  for savings  to win an iPod.  It's like,  no,  you know,  it's just a link  that's going  to click you  over and put  some crap  all over your  computer. 
[01:38:00]  Don't click it,  dummies.  Oh,  that's what's  going on?  Yeah,  of course.  We called the  White House  tonight to get  their reaction.  Yeah,  they're going to  get right back  to you.  Some local  dummy.  Yeah.  We called the  White House.  Well,  we're working  on it very  diligently in the  war room.  We called the  White House  tonight to get  their reaction  to this latest  attempt to mock  the president.  No comment.  Then we took it  to the streets  and found  New Yorkers  sure are talking.  The gun  was a little  extreme.  This is Jimmy's  favorite part, 
[01:38:30]  by the way.  I want to bite  something.  When they go  to the streets.  And I usually  don't like  biting things.  Reporter's face.  I want to bite  somebody.  Yeah.  So we took  it to the streets.  It's a non-story.  Sure are talking.  The gun  was a little  extreme.  Was it?  The shoes,  like whatever,  that's what happened.  What do you think  of it?  I think it's  hilarious.  I think it's  really tasteless.  If you want  to take your  chances for  taking the  president from  flying footwear,  all you have  to do is go  to our website  where you can  play the game  yourself.  Okay. 
[01:39:00]  Look.  They were  calling it  shocking,  outrageous,  tasteless,  yet it's on  their website.  Build web  traffic.  They want  traffic.  So they put  it on their  site.  Enough said  right there.  There's two  guns pointed  at the president  and you're  shooting shoes.  So it looks  like you're  shooting at Bush.  It does.  And that he's  ducking from  the shot.  Exactly.  Ducking from  the shoes  that he  tries to  shoot out  of the air.  So that  news station's  website has  basically 
[01:39:30]  firing guns  at the  president in  this video  game.  What news  station was  that?  Yeah.  What channel?  Channel?  Is that our  own?  They're all  the same.  I don't  know.  But was  it ours?  Because I'd  love to know  since they put  so many  restrictions on  what we can  put on our  website,  yet they can  throw that.  Oh, yeah.  What channel  was that  there?  It was the  old CW.  Ah, the CW.  Ah, CW.  Okay.  They're barely  news.  By the way,  we will link  this on  onaradio.com  because, yeah, 
[01:40:00]  because it's  in the news.  That's all.  Yeah, why not?  I don't care either  way.  Check it out for  yourself for five  minutes.  You'll play and  then you'll move  on to some other  dumb thing.  But the news is  doing it to  certainly drive  web traffic in  the guise that  this is outrageous  and long.  So outrageous.  I'm so  outraged.  Oh.  All right.  Some would  consider shocking.  Yes, in 1978,  I'm sure they  would have.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Well, we found  a list of how to  insult people around  the world.  Oh.  Because we found  out that taking  your shoe off in  the Middle East  and throwing it at  someone is the  ultimate insult.  That's the big  insult for their  shoe.  So we kind of  took a look around  the world to see  what other things  you could do to  insult people.  It's probably  because it smells  so bad, their  shoes.  I just picture  them stinking.  Iraqi shoes.  What smells  worse, their  shoes or their  left hand? 
[01:41:00]  Well, we all  hear about what  they do with  their left hand.  Yeah.  Because of the  lack of toilet  paper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Allegedly.  Is that real?  It's probably  like the 1800s.  Or something.  Yeah.  I'm sure with  a little bit of  oil money you  could buy some  toilet paper.  I have a question,  Ant.  Do you know the  answers to these?  Or do you know  the answers?  You have in front  of me.  Do you not know  the answers?  Of why this is  insulting?  No, no, no,  no.  Of what country  what's insulting?  What do you mean? 
[01:41:30]  Because there's a  list of countries.  Yeah.  Like in how you  insult people.  Okay.  So I'm saying  maybe we could  guess, you can  name the country,  we could guess  what the insulting  action is.  Oh.  Wow.  I don't know if  you read it or  have it.  So if you want  to play, well I'll  guess if you didn't  read them.  So you want to  start with Japan?  I could be like  the, I could throw  out the country and  then what, you want  to?  We're all this  good.  You can have  a stump right  for the country.  We can all guess.  And you have to  try to figure out  what would be  insulting in the  Japanese culture.  Yes. 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  Japan.  Showing a photo  of your genitals  with a ruler next  to them.  Very insulting  indeed.  Was that the joke  you wanted to get  out or is there  no, I didn't know  a country you  were going to  go.  Or there's  another one on  this list.  There's actually  not one.  Yes, there is.  There's one that  really excites you.  You need a set up.  Just tell me where  you need the set up.  What number?  I honestly, God,  do not know.  I'll give you a  nice bounce pass 
[01:42:30]  toward the basket.  I would say Japan.  Yeah, Japan.  What would be  the ultimate insult  in the Japanese  culture?  Finding a tub girl  in your bathroom.  Oh, nice.  It's very insulting.  Especially when you  got to get out  the old comet.  Scrubbing that  ring away.  Let me guess.  Creating cartoons  where there's not  a hint of pedophilia  or murder  or some type  of sexual barbarism. 
[01:43:00]  Hey, all right.  I like this bit.  The real answer  in Japan,  unless you have  some more...  Where, by the way,  a hand can be used  like a knife.  What?  What?  What?  If you're handed  a business card...  Yes.  If you're handed  a business card  in Japan,  that's really bad.  What?  You could cause  maximum offense  by throwing it  down on your desk  or stuffing it  in your back pocket  as the exchange  of business cards  here is meant 
[01:43:30]  to be a well-thought-out  practice.  Really?  So, all right.  So, there's no problem  with handing over  your business card,  but if you don't  like that person  and you want  to insult them,  then you throw it  down on the desk  or you stuff  in your back pocket  and that's like  the ultimate insult  in Japan.  Ah.  Got it?  Got it.  All right.  Spitting a loogie on it.  I'm sure that's not  smiled upon either.  No.  How about the Philippines,  Jimmy?  The Philippines.  What's the ultimate insult  in the Philippines  or a biggie?  Being in the military  and having sex 
[01:44:00]  with a girl  where there's  no money exchanged.  We're actually  using ping-pong balls  to play ping-pong.  These countries suck.  Yeah.  In the Philippines,  a curled,  beckoning forefinger  isn't used  to summon someone over.  Like the old,  hey, come here.  Yeah.  but rather to call them a dog.  This is calling someone a dog.  Nobody likes to be called lunch. 
[01:44:30]  But the insult is punishable by arrest  and even breaking the finger that committed the offense.  So use with caution.  Really?  These are boring insults.  They're kind of awful.  How about in India and Africa?  What, same one?  What do you mean?  Yeah, I guess they have the same kind of insult thing.  Eating?  Yeah.  Eating without the courtesy of putting flies around someone's head. 
[01:45:00]  Having drinking water that doesn't look like it was in the Star Wars compactor scene.  All right, bit back on.  We're letting your daughter keep her.  In India and Africa.  Where people use their hands to eat,  it is considered an insult to use your left hand  as this is thought to be unclean and used only for a related function  which follows several hours later. 
[01:45:30]  Ah, there it is.  You can't eat with the left hand.  We're going to have more after the break.  I would never go to India or Africa and eat anything.  Yeah.  Like, what, would you go to a restaurant there and have them serve you?  Here, here's an AIDS chop.  I just picture everything having AIDS on it.  Can I have the AIDS Jell-O?  It's running rampant over there.  Why would you go?  Well, it's like Chinese food.  You have, like, you say no MSG.  You have to say that.  I want that without AIDS. 
[01:46:00]  Yes.  Could you, uh, no AIDS, please?  Oh, but we make everything with AIDS.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll have to go somewhere else.  It's all prepared the same way.  You have three shakers at S, P, and A.  I've got to say, I still haven't recovered from what I saw in the bathroom during the last break.  Wow.  What a shocker that was for you.  I just realized that I'm trying to recover, and it's, why?  It's taken a while.  It looked like the hook they used at the Apollo to pull you off stage. 
[01:46:30]  It did.  I only saw a photo of it, and it was disturbing.  Opie walked in on it live.  Yeah.  Apparently Jimmy was in the, um.  We have a bathroom.  The bathroom.  It's literally 15 feet away from Jimmy.  It's right here in the studio.  Right here in the studio.  And between breaks, we run in there and do what we have to do.  And, uh, Jimmy finds it fun to kind of leave a little something-something for everybody.  And, uh, wow, wow.  Wow-wee.  Wow.  Wow-wee-wah. 
[01:47:00]  What?  Wow.  I'm trying to figure out how we can explain this without, uh, getting the wrath of the lawyers.  It was.  Wow-wee-wah.  Yes, of course.  Wow-wee-wah.  Uh, Opie went to go into the bathroom, and Jimmy had been in there, uh, prior to Opie  going in.  And he seems to have left, uh, a lawyer, an ex-wife, uh, quite a few things you could  call it.  Yeah.  He left that in there, and wow, if that wasn't shaped like, um, it was shaped like a giant 
[01:47:30]  Clydesdales horseshoe.  Yeah.  In the bottom of the, um, churl it.  And it had no friends.  No, no, no.  That's what was impressive to me.  It was, uh, single serving.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And no friend, not a friend to be found.  And what did you do, uh, to clean yourself?  I did, uh, let's just say.  Because there was nothing there.  Sure there was.  Well, he wants a good presentation, so I don't know what he does to make sure that. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  I'll tell you what I do.  You could see the whole thing.  Yeah, because, uh, if you clean yourself and then deposit that, you're covering up the  goodness of the surprise.  Nice.  Picture a nice white plate.  They're in a restaurant.  Yes.  And you, I'd like a Snickers bar, please.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, they put the Snickers bar in the middle of this plate in the restaurant, and, uh, you  have a bunch of napkins.  Now, why would you throw the napkins right on top of the Snicker bar, where you could just  kind of dab it your mouth and then put the napkins around the outside of the plate, and then  the Snickers bar would be very presentable right there, but the napkins would still have 
[01:48:30]  been used around the outside of the plate.  You've explained it perfectly.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, I usually just use the garbage pail when I want to, like, percent.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I've done that a couple times.  Oh, uh, Opie and Anthony, why don't you stay right there?  We'll finish this list, and we'll do some other things.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Radio dial.  We'll mop it up here.  We did good today. 
[01:49:00]  So fast.  Just making sure we did almost everything.  Oh, Peter Falk has Alzheimer's.  I had a video of him a few months ago.  Oh, wow, that was bad.  Looking like a raving lunatic just wandering around Beverly Hills, and we all had fun with  that.  Yeah.  And it turns out, well, he was doing that because he was losing his effing mind, for  real.  It wasn't like a, you know, an alcohol or drug thing.  How old is that guy?  He's got to be 80, right? 
[01:49:30]  At this point, I would say older than that.  Even older than 80.  So he's got the Alzheimer's.  That's official.  Uh, school system in D.C. area getting rid of gifted.  I believe the criminal was a toaster.  Just looks pointing at appliances.  Pardon me one more thing, Blender.  Here's the bit.  Yeah, the poor bastard.  I would like the music to accompany him.  That's all right.  Just kind of feel bad for him.  What happened?  No, I was saying, you just kind of feel bad for the poor old bastard. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  He drove his car into a wall, apparently, six months ago.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Someone paint a tunnel on it.  The coyote.  Dummy.  Dummy.  You live your whole life to go out that way.  For your brain to just shrivel up like a walnut.  What the hell does all this mean?  Shaking around in his head.  You don't think he'd be a good detective at this point?  No, I think he'd suck at this point as a detective.  What does it all mean?  Pardon me, ma'am.  One more thing, ma'am.  What size shoe do you wear? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, excuse me, other corpse.  He starts talking to the corpse.  I have to question her.  Oh, ABC mystery movie.  Really?  I remember watching this.  Really?  I believe the criminal is Martin Landau, so I've actually arrested the actor, Martin Landau, because I'm crazy.  Running around naked.  Oh, poor Columbo. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  I just feel bad for him.  Yeah.  Old codger.  Big Peter Falk bag.  Yeah.  Stepping on it.  So that's happening today.  And then you got this school system in, I don't know what's going on with this, Stumper, and you'll have to help me out with this one.  School system in D.C. area, getting rid of gifted because it's mean to other kids.  Yeah.  The term gifted.  Gifted meaning in a good way.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a gifted child.  Smart kids.  He's a smarty. 
[01:51:30]  Not like special, which is bad.  Right.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, no, that was just a good point.  Yeah, special is bad.  Special means mohair cut.  Yeah, this is smart because it's not like we're competing with the rest of the world or anything, so why not show your kids that everyone's equal and, you know, there's no reason to get ahead or try harder than others.  When they say you're in the gifted class, you're a gifted child, they don't want to use that because the other kids that aren't gifted will feel left out.  Well, they'll find something else they're good at. 
[01:52:00]  What the hell are people trying to raise in this country?  Robots.  Retards.  Well, they're actually, the thing is, they take away the label gifted, but they're just labeling all the other kids stupid.  Like, if you're gifted, they don't put you in anything that's regular class.  Yeah.  Everyone else is considered dumbbells.  Stupid.  If you're not in the, quote, what used to be the gifted class, you have to wear a hat with a propeller on it and make der sounds before you talk.  They won't listen to you unless you go, I'm der.  Well, we're learning that the gifted label is a hot potato in public education, a school that tells some students they have gifts, risk dashing the academic dreams of everyone else. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Too bad.  Any formula for identifying gifted children, no matter how sophisticated, can be condemned for those, it leaves out.  Yeah.  I want to understand their thought process on all this stuff.  How about we not tell anybody they won the election?  We just have people who got votes. 
[01:53:00]  No, you can't do that because you never know who's president.  Yeah.  There you go.  Literal Jim.  Literal Jim.  What are you doing?  But he's right.  That's not...  The aim is to get away from this idea of putting kids in boxes and saying, you're gifted and you're not.  No, the idea is actually to put the kids in one big box.  They're doing exactly the opposite of what they say.  They're putting everybody in one big box.  Yeah.  And saying, you're all exactly the same.  Right.  So they're lying.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:53:30]  The kids know better.  The kids get it.  There are smarter kids than some other kids.  What do you...  You know, it's the way it is.  I think that all colleges should have the same admissions test then.  I guess maybe Harvard should have the same admissions test and the same admissions scores as...  They should let everyone into Harvard.  Absolutely.  Why not?  Who cares?  God, in this day and age where the competition's getting tougher and tougher out there with the rest of the world.  We're doing this to our children?  Ourselves, yeah.  It's stupid. 
[01:54:00]  Good.  We're doomed anyway.  Yeah.  Like I said, we're going to be around.  We're going to be around for the big apocalypse.  And the Florida police finally closed John Walsh's son's...  Adam's murder.  Your son.  The 81 murder.  Everyone knew it was Otto's tool, but his...  It was Otto's tool.  He was a serial killer, Jeremy?  He should have just had his throat cut.  I mean, he was...  I think he hung with Henry Lee Lucas, if I remember correctly.  He was a bad, bad boy.  He's a filth bag and a pedophile.  And he killed Adam. 
[01:54:30]  But they had DNA on a rug.  They didn't have DNA back then, but they had a bloodstained carpet that these dopey Florida cops lost.  I mean, they blew it.  They actually wouldn't have identified it properly.  I think they knew that he would be bled on this rug.  But then they lost the evidence, and then they lost the car.  Just a bunch of dumb hayseeds.  Now, they officially closed the case.  What changed?  Because didn't this guy, like, confess a couple times when he was in jail?  Yeah, but he's a crazy guy.  Like, he confessed twice, then recanted. 
[01:55:00]  And he also confessed to, like, hundreds of murders that he didn't commit.  But I think he took them to where they found the head.  And his daughter, his niece, said he did confess on his deathbed that he, in fact, did kill Adam Walsh.  He just, he died in 96.  And it's every parent's nightmare.  It was in a Sears, right?  With the mom, and the mom's, like, turns around and the kid's gone.  Goes out in the aisle for a second.  And this is why, like, when people talk about putting chips in your kids, there's this knee-jerk reaction.  Like, you can't do that, because then the government knows where you are. 
[01:55:30]  But it's like, well, this is why it's not necessarily a bad thing.  Because when your six-year-old goes down the wrong aisle, if there's a way to track really fast.  Because Otis Tull said he drove around for an hour with this kid alive.  Really?  Before he killed him.  I read the account of what he did to him.  It's disgusting.  It's the worst thing I've ever read.  And, you know, maybe a little chip is not necessarily a bad thing if there's a way to turn it off when you turn a certain age.  Or to take it out when you turn a certain age.  Or just let the parents decide. 
[01:56:00]  I want my kid to have a chip for a while.  For a few years.  Like a low jack.  But if you could track this, say this kid could have been tracked in, like, less than 15 minutes.  Yeah.  For all these girls, or kids that could kidnap, you'd have almost no cases of it.  Yeah, right.  Ugh.  27 years ago.  So Adam Walsh would have been, what, like, 33 now.  Wow.  Yeah.  Something like that.  An hour as to how long he was alive?  Yeah.  God, all the hope after that hour that they had.  It's...  Just like, knowing now that it's like, no, it's just an hour, and then he was dead. 
[01:56:30]  And, uh, yeah, he...  How do they know it was only an hour?  That's what Otis Toole said.  He's, he...  I read...  So he kidnaps the kid, hour later, kid's dead.  Well, he tried to do certain...  I don't...  I forget the account.  I read it a few years ago.  But I know he...  I think he lured the kid away with a fire truck.  Or he said he had a fire truck and, uh...  Something about a fire truck?  Yeah, something like that.  And he was abusing him in the car, like, hitting him.  And it just...  All you want to do is just cut the guy's throat.  I mean, it's...  And just let him bleed out.  You can't even express how it's disgusting. 
[01:57:00]  Uh, where were the death penalty, uh, people on this one?  He should live?  Someone like that should live in prison?  Would they...  I think he died of cancer, which is kind of cool.  But when you're that...  They should just kind of let you have cancer and then give you no treatment whatsoever.  Oh, yeah.  Just let it eat you away.  Yeah.  Eat away your soul.  The pain and everything.  That's a nice slow death.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  All right.  So that's, uh...  That's over for the Walsh family, finally.  They got some closure.  I mean, it's a terrible thing, but out of that came a really angry dude.  Wow. 
[01:57:30]  Who has, uh...  I mean, like, a lot of people are in prison because of...  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  A lot of people ended up going to prison.  Is that show still on TV?  Yeah.  I used to love it, but I haven't watched it in years.  What...  Who's going to be the network exec that goes, look, uh, the ratings...  They tried.  They did.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, they tried.  Okay, good, yeah.  It was an outrage.  So some scumbag network exec did try to do that because the ratings were down.  Bah, ratings are down.  Let's pull this show off the air.  Hey, idiot.  It's like a public service for your, you know... 
[01:58:00]  You're locking up murderers.  When you agree to do the Adam Walsh show, America's Most Wanted, you have to agree that  you're going to be with this show forever.  You can't ride its success and then go, ah, we're done with you.  You're in it for the long haul.  Well, he's locking up a lot of scum you-know-what, saving a lot of families a lot of grief, getting  closure for a lot of families.  You can't be the guy, well, we got this cute new reality show we want to put in its place.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Well, he, uh, there was an outcry from people and from cops, because cops and, like, people  on Capitol Hill, like, they all love this show because it's helped get all these filth  bags locked up.  Good for him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He made, uh, he made some lemonade, huh?  Well, I mean...  Jesus.  Jesus.  The hell of a way to make lemonade.  Oh, God.  Christ.  You're right, though, man.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  He was one of the...  He was really one of the first high-profile kind of, hey, my kid was murdered, let me  start doing some crap. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think he started that whole thing.  Yeah, because then after that, a lot of people started getting involved with these things.  You just turned...  You know, because you were just a victim before that, I guess.  You know, you just had to live with your grief or whatever, and then you decided...  It was milk cartons before then.  Yeah, yeah.  You see a missing kid on this...  Yeah, a missing kid milk carton.  I think he also fought for victims' impact statements, and also things like these...  There's a case of a guy, I think, I want to say Polly Class, the girl who was killed  by this...  Yeah.  Richard something his name was. 
[01:59:30]  Another guy who's just been killed like a roach.  And in court, he said something about, like, the girl's last statement was how what he was  doing to her was kind of like the way daddy does.  It was some...  Oh, right.  It was some remark where you really just want to strangle the guy with a chain just  to hurt the family.  And the father, of course, tried to attack him, and they dragged the father out.  And John Walsh was saying, and this guy gets to stay in here, and they're dragging the  father out of the court and being treated as a criminal while he gets to sit there and  say this guy.  Yeah, they're disgusting.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Absolutely disgusting.  Watch your impact statements and stuff like that.  Mopping up here, how to insult people around the world.  I scratched out all the really bad ones.  You want a couple more before we leave?  Who wouldn't?  Yes, like in New York, you put Alan Alda on a news station, which has nowhere near the  amount of...  No one watches.  ...people as this.  Good.  Stupid publicist.  Alan Alda.  All right.  How old is Alan Alda?  He's got to be in his 40s.  Yeah.  He's in his 40s.  Hey, Jesus.  Yeah, because of the shoe-throwing incident, there's other insults you could do around the 
[02:00:30]  world.  Excuse me.  Another one for the Japanese.  If you blow your nose into a handkerchief in Japan, that is really bad.  Are you supposed to do a snot rocket?  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  You'll insult those around you because the Japanese word for snot literally means nose...  Nose feces?  Yeah, nose crap.  Nose...  They use the S word.  And the idea of carrying this around all day is thought to be disgusting, which it 
[02:01:00]  is.  My dad had a dumb hanky.  I thought it was the most disgusting thing ever.  Hankies are so gross.  All right.  Why would you carry around dry, crusty snot?  The older generation love their hankies.  I'll tell you what the solution is that they suggest.  I mean, it's weird, but they carry around a piece of Melba toast, and when it's covered  in boogies, they'll eat it.  Boogies.  I love anything that's covered in boogies.  Boogie. 
[02:01:30]  Mr. Rooney should do a little thing on the hanky.  The hanky.  It's a...  Yeah, that was an old school thing.  Here, come here, blow.  Yeah, my dad would, like, hand over his hanky if he had a lot of nose.  No.  It's like, what do you think?  It magically disappears?  There's still snot in this.  Oh.  It's like having a hanky instead of toilet paper.  Right.  You just use it, put it in your back pocket, wherever you go.  Here, can you need this?  And then my mom would wash the hankies with our clothes. 
[02:02:00]  It's like, what are you doing?  Where's that going?  Right.  It doesn't magically disappear in the washing machine.  I just...  Gieved out.  Look down at your jeans and you see one that was able to survive?  Yeah.  The rinse cycle?  Uh...  Andy Rooney, hankies?  No?  All right.  People don't use hankies anymore.  Right.  I wonder why.  Could it be that snot doesn't just go away? 
[02:02:30]  It's in the hanky for good?  You put it in your pocket thinking, when I have a runny nose next time, I'll pull it out  and it'll be a clean hanky.  But then you try to peel it apart and it's all crusty and green.  With boogies.  Boogies.  Boogies.  I'm still laughing at boogies.  Ah, boogies.  I want to wear a hat with a brim that's just covered in boogies.  Boogies.  Nobody would want to hug you.  I wouldn't want to hug you.  A hat covered in boogies. 
[02:03:00]  You've seen the men's room at the other joint, at the urinals, right above the urinals, there's  a display of...  Boogies.  Oh, yeah.  You've seen that too, right, Danny?  Yeah.  I mean, I've brought it up to a few different people.  Oh, you have.  Okay.  I've tracked the progress of this for quite some time.  And I guess after every few months, I guess one of the cleaning people decides to finally  get to it.  Yeah.  But then I notice it starts to grow back.  It's a display of boogies on the wall.  It's nasty.  It's so nasty.  It's so gross.  And whoever's doing it, they purposely go to the same urinal because that's where their 
[02:03:30]  collection is and they have to add to it.  Do you ever go in a public bathroom and you just see something and you just think to yourself,  why?  Like, why is it on the walls?  And why is it...  Like, why?  Do people get angry when they get in there?  I was out last weekend and I told you at that bar next door to Riley's.  Right.  Riley's was booked up for the evening.  Riley's, of course, always your first choice when you hit a honeycomb. 
[02:04:00]  Of course.  Of course.  Some gentleman decided to go into the bathroom and completely missed the toilet bowl.  Right.  I mean, completely missed it.  Got the floor, got the rim, and I'm not talking something that can be mopped up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you kidding?  Not kidding.  On the walls.  And that's what I mean.  Everywhere.  Where the guy had to go in there with a pot full of boiling water and just start throwing 
[02:04:30]  it on the floor.  Who's like...  Can I play devil's advocate?  Because I've had that happen before.  Sure.  I couldn't reach the seat.  Yeah.  My shoes.  I didn't have my legs.  I had to stand on a septic tank.  I had a little problem.  I cleaned up whatever I could with my wig.  You'd be surprised how well that acts as wig glued. 
[02:05:00]  Doesn't stink half as much as my last five movies.  88 minutes.  That was a good one.  A good.  I got shot at the end of the new De Niro movie.  My little lips were showing.  Little lips.  Oh, it's so funny.  You're going to defend people that do this?  Go ahead.  Yeah, what's the devil's advocate?  I've actually had it happen a couple of times with me.  What happens is I'm fine.  But if I'm going and all of a sudden I hear the safety dance playing over the loudspeaker, 
[02:05:30]  I have to get up and do it.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What the hell?  This is why they've added a third show to the Brigade in Atlantic City, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, I just give up and I angrily do the safety dance around the inside of the stall.  Nice.  S, S, S, S.  And I never get beyond that.  Safety dance.  We had a guy in my fraternity back in Geneseo that had explosive all over our couch in 
[02:06:00]  the TV room.  And you might say, but Opie, that means he had to be naked.  Yeah, that's what we were wondering.  Could have been shorts.  Why are you naked on the fraternity couch in the TV room?  Because it's a fraternity and fraternities are gay.  And why the explosive, you know what, all over the couch and the wall, by the way, too.  True story.  A wall, too.  Yeah.  Korea.  How do you insult somebody in Korea? 
[02:06:30]  We're almost done here.  You ask someone to autograph a MASH DVD?  By the way, the Babe Ruth ball is in a safe deposit box.  Yes.  And people are saying I could get maybe $20,000 for it.  Wow.  I think it's more than that, actually.  Yeah, probably, depending on the condition.  I've decided that there's no reason to have it anymore, because I don't really trust  displaying it in my apartment. 
[02:07:00]  So I'm going to sell that in the very near future.  I want to get something respectable for it.  What do you do with the cash?  Buy a Mickey Mammable ball.  Maybe we'll just throw it around to the listeners or something.  Maybe we'll do our bid, Ant.  You should just take it out to the sandlot and play ball with it.  Ah.  Sandlot?  Of course, yes.  Forever.  That's right. 
[02:07:30]  I'll try to figure out how we're going to sell this.  Korea.  To insult someone in Korea, you simply have to smile.  Oh, really?  Is that what the...  Because smiling at a stranger is thought to be very rude, and a clear indication that  you believe them to be stupid.  Do they tell you this crap when you visit these places?  Probably not.  They give you a little pamphlet, don't smile at anybody.  Hell no.  That seems really stupid.  Hell no.  So, if a Korean smiles at you, he thinks you're stupid. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And finally, in Buddhist countries, anyone?  Buddhists spit on their tummy and rub it for luck.  Don't...  Oh, I know.  They don't like it when you grab their genitals and pull them down like winter.  Window shades. 
[02:08:30]  It's considered an insult.  I don't see.  Let them flap up and make a window shade noise.  I hate that.  It's very rude.  I don't feel like telling you.  Oh.  Go screw.  Go find out for yourself.  I don't feel like caring.  I care.  Do you?  Yeah.  It'll drive you nuts.  You'll have to now Google that.  You watch.  Can we get out of here now?  I think 80,000 other things I'd Google first, but... 
[02:09:00]  No, it gets in your head, though.  It gets in the weird, like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the nooks and crannies of your brain, you go, damn it, I gotta find out now.  What does?  I've already...  I've already forgotten to see how that works.  We got Greg Gutfield over at SiriusXM.  We got Maria from the WWE.  I don't know who she is.  She's promoting something.  Some hot bitch.  But Greg Gutfield does red eye.  Yeah.  Funny guy. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, very fun.  Very cool guy.  All right.  We're out of here.  So, uh...  That's that, I guess, for today.  Yeah.  Well...  Yeah, we're on.  Yeah.  Bye.  Jimmy brought a friend over to XM today.  I certainly did.  Found a friend, Harry. 
[02:10:00]  It's Gary, uh...  Gary, it's Greg Gutfeld.  Greg Gutfeld from Red Eye.  How are you?  How are you, Greg?  I'm doing great.  It's great to be here.  You sure?  I think so.  You just sat down.  Are you sure?  Why don't you give him a few times?  Always nice to be next to Jim.  A few minutes, yeah.  Jim makes me feel comfortable.  Well, Jimmy does Red Eye, uh, like, twice a month at this point, and, uh, I've seen a  couple tapings, and you do a great job, and it's...  Oh, thank you.  I think the show's on, what, like, midnight on the East Coast?  Midnight West at 3 a.m. East Coast, so the only people who are up are meth heads 
[02:10:30]  in...  3 a.m. East Coast, Midnight West Coast.  People looking for Coke.  It's great, though.  The one thing about the hour that's kind of cool is, uh, you can kind of say what you  want.  Like, the content...  I mean, within reason, but the content freedom is amazing.  We give it a lot more on that show than we do in the morning over at...  Yeah.  So, yes, a lot more.  Ridiculous.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  But there's always that feeling after the show that you've gone too far.  And then you're up half the night just, like, sweating.  Oh, been there, my friend.  Yeah, it's the worst feeling.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  It's just terrible.  So then, now I do this thing where I just bleep everything so I can go to bed at night.  But it's never swear words.  It's always that thing that you think is racist.  Yeah, yeah.  It's never racist, but you think that somebody's going to perceive it as racist, so it freaks you  out.  Yeah, you really got to kind of zig and zag your way through some of that.  Some people don't quite understand that, like guests on the show sometimes will say something  and you're like, Jesus Christ, are you an idiot?  Yeah, exactly.  You know, that's, like, blatant.  At least try to weave your way through it.  Stay away from the homeless people and you'll be all right. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  That's what got us in trouble.  I mean.  Yeah, they don't have any good filters for their language on radio.  No.  But that's what, the funny part, you don't know where it's going to come from, like you  said, because we do crazy shit.  No, they're fine with that.  It was when a homeless guy went too far that we get, you know, in trouble.  I've noticed it from older comedians, comedians that are in their 60s, who have, who grew  up in the 70s, and the Don Rickles era, who just feel like there's no holds barred, and  they use the old vernacular.  Yeah, they're, it's colored, guys. 
[02:12:00]  Exactly.  You're just going, crap.  Yeah, you're like, um, wow.  Yeah.  That was, that was like four things ago.  There was Afro-American after that.  Negro.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's nice ones.  Like Pat Cooper at the Pat Cooper roast.  He didn't, and Pat's not a racist.  He's such an old school, great comic.  No, he's a racist.  Well, what do you think makes it comic great?  He was at, and Michael Spinks was there, and at the roast, Pat was saying, they're telling  me I can't say nigger, and he was saying it, and this is what Michael Spinks was right 
[02:12:30]  there, they're telling me I can't call Michael Spinks a nigger, and it was uncomfortable.  Yes, it was.  But not because you thought Pat was a racist, because you didn't.  You didn't think that he was being hateful, but it was almost like Michael must feel really  awkward, like, like, what are people going to think of him for being comfortable with that?  And just kind of sitting there, and yeah.  And there's a thousand people in the room.  Yeah.  And Al Roker was there.  White people.  It was, yeah, I bet no Roker was there.  It wasn't like this was some closed white guy society.  Everybody knew it was not coming from a hateful place.  But even that, like, that was a rough one. 
[02:13:00]  Like, that was like, oof.  Because you kind of felt bad for Michael Spinks.  Like, oh, man, he must really be fucking.  It's kind of been built into that.  I looked at Roker, though, and he was enjoying that whole thing that Pat Cooper was doing.  You know, the guy that had problems with Imus?  Yeah.  Ass.  I don't know.  It's one of those situations where I think what's happened of late the past couple of  years has kind of made it, made you feel more uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Even when it is in the context of pure comedy.  Have you seen Grant Torino, the Clint Eastwood movie, in which that's for two hours. 
[02:13:30]  That's all he does.  That's all he does.  Really?  It's fantastic.  Only he could do this.  If it was anybody else, it's actually more of an honest movie about race than anything  Spike Lee has ever done.  Because he uses the terms you'd expect from an 80-year-old ex-military dude living in Detroit.  And you're watching this going, I can't believe this is actually.  He goes all out.  He says the N-word.  He doesn't say the N-word.  He uses it.  But it's mainly directed at Asians because he's living next door to, I guess they're called 
[02:14:00]  Hamongs.  And then there's some black gangbangers.  He uses some phrases towards them.  But he basically insults every single race.  And his message is you should be able to, I guess.  So why isn't he going all out and using the N-word for the blacks?  I think he knew that that was...  Too far?  Yeah, it was too far.  Even for a movie?  I think he uses the phrase colored.  He repeatedly uses the derogatory terms for Asians.  But that would take me out of the movie because obviously the insult would be the N-word.  So, you know.  And what does he call the Asians in the movie? 
[02:14:30]  The books.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, yeah.  He uses that.  In an endearing way.  That keeps me in the movie.  Yeah, exactly.  But it's a very odd but entertaining film.  Yeah.  I haven't seen anything new.  I keep seeing the posters.  Well, I would say, if it's just to hear Eastwood saying that stuff, I probably would.  Yeah.  But the acting is not very good because they're all new actors.  I guess they're either Vietnamese or they're from other Hmong.  I don't know.  But they can't...  You know, they're too young or inexperienced.  So it's kind of hard.  Oh, really?  You keep calling him Dirty Hallie. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  This is just silly.  Nice.  Hey, I was watching the beginning of the Twilight Zone movie.  Now, that was way in the 80s and stuff.  And the Vic Morrow racist character.  I mean, he...  They went all out back then.  They didn't care.  Yeah.  He walked into a bar.  A couple of his buddies call him over.  He sits down and starts bitching about the fact that he didn't get the...  That promotion didn't come through for him.  And he's blaming the Jews.  And there's a table full of black guys sitting there.  And one of them was like the head... 
[02:15:30]  I think he was the head guy from like 21 Jump Street.  Remember him?  Mm-hmm.  And oh, he was just throwing around some hefty language to where the black gentleman had  to get up and tell him to maybe simmer down and quiet down a bit.  Then he's going off on the Jews and the Asians and blacks and...  Did they actually use the word simmer?  Hey, fella.  Simmer down.  Simmer down.  They told him to cool off or something.  Yeah.  And then he goes outside and all of a sudden it's Nazi Germany or something.  It was an interesting little episode.  And the joke is on him, right? 
[02:16:00]  The joke is on him.  And at the end he's being hauled away in a boxcar as going to a concentration camp.  Right.  And the last roll he did, his head actually made an appearance in the box at the end of  Seven.  Yeah.  You know who his daughter is, right?  Yes.  She's interesting.  Jennifer Jason Leigh.  That's his daughter?  Yeah.  I can't still figure out if I remember her from Fast Times.  Of course.  But then after that she did a lot of weird stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  She doesn't look like him.  Yeah.  She had a fucked up body. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Even then.  Because she was kind of young then and still it was kind of...  Like she had a gut and her tits were a little saggy for fucking an 18 year old or something.  She was a normal American girl.  Just getting fucked at every turn in that movie.  She had that cool little lip that Vic Morrow had.  That little upturned lip.  Oh yeah, she did.  Yeah.  You remember that like on Rat Patrol or something.  Back old school Vic Morrow.  If you had a man crush in Vic Morrow, she was like the perfect girl for you.  Or combat.  Yeah, she is.  She had a nice little skank to her though. 
[02:17:00]  Next to fucking Phoebe Cates though in that movie?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Whatever.  What is she doing?  She married Kevin Kline.  He took her off the radar.  And he just like buried her somewhere.  That's it.  She's still hot.  You're never seeing her again.  Is she?  Yeah, she really is.  I know you're not a big fan of the older woman.  No, I mean the pool scene will always be the...  But as far as older women go, she definitely held it to her.  She was like a better version of Jessica Alba.  Do you notice that?  Because they kind of had the same features.  Yeah, yeah.  Same kind of look to her.  Yeah.  But that bikini scene when she comes out of the pool. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  What's his face?  He there is jerking off in his little pirate uniform.  Judd Nelson?  Yeah.  He likes to see.  No, Judd Reinhold.  No, Judd Reinhold.  That was it.  And then he found God.  Did he really?  Did he?  Yeah, and he disappeared for a while.  Found Jesus.  And that's why you didn't see him for a long time.  I had no idea what happened.  I forgot about him.  I think because all his movies bombed after him.  And he was...  Remember Beverly Hills Cop?  He was actually going up and then he just...  That was it.  Yeah.  Gone.  That's...  Hi, Brad. 
[02:18:00]  You always...  You know what?  I always...  Something.  Like I can remember the line when I'm looking at her tits.  Yeah.  That was like hardcore porn when you were growing up, man.  That was great.  Yeah, times.  And he's breathing like Luke Costello when he took a look at his pool.  Luke Costello.  I got to do a little research and find out what happened there.  Do you know what happened in Luke Costello's pool?  Yeah.  Kid wasn't a very good swimmer.  He was like Jason Voorhees. 
[02:18:30]  Apparently.  I ain't fucking...  I don't know this story.  Oh, Luke Costello, his son drowned in his pool?  Oh, I didn't know that.  It was his son.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, and many...  I mean, obviously in the 40s or 50s, I don't know.  What was it with Fat Comedians?  Fatty Arbuckle and the Bottle?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  The Bottle story?  Terrific.  And like fucking Pink Sock there.  It's like the St. Francis of Fairmont Hotel, San Francisco, and parties with some woman.  And she's dead.  And there's something involving a bottle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A Coke bottle or something.  Yeah.  He was using a bottle.  Fatty Arbuckle. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  How was he getting pussy back then?  I don't know.  He was a monster.  Yeah, he really was.  They were all fat comedians.  We're like crazy.  Yeah, the old, oldie, oldie guys back then.  It wasn't even talkies, was it?  With Fatty Arbuckle?  I don't know.  I've never seen him.  I only know that story.  You know, his career never caught a Fatty Arbuckle movie?  Well, they couldn't see.  They had talkies, but he couldn't because all he would say is, open your cunt.  I want to put a bottle in.  And they're like, just cunt.  Yeah, we got it. 
[02:19:30]  Fatty, you got to say that.  You can't say that again.  Hey, what is Red Eye doing on the whole shoe incident with the president?  What was your take on that?  I was just surprised at Bush's reflexes.  I thought were really.  Cat-like.  I know.  He was enjoying it.  He also laughed.  He was enjoying it.  Yeah, and then, I mean, I said in the show that, like, you could almost, you could spin  it to say that this is a reflection of a free Iraq, that this couldn't happen five years  ago.  If you threw a shoe at anybody, you'd be dead. 
[02:20:00]  But it reflects a lot of people who want him to get out of there, but it also shows  that anything's possible now.  I'm impressed by his reflexes.  Yeah, it's incredible.  He obviously is a natural athlete.  He must be really bored, because that second shoe, he was like, yeah, game on.  Do you notice how attractive, though?  Do you know that spokesperson, Dana Perino, the blonde girl?  Sure.  She had a little black eye.  I guess she got hit.  Yeah.  She was so cute.  With the black eye?  Yeah, I don't know what it was. 
[02:20:30]  Is there a, do I have a problem?  No, but do I have a problem when you see something like that?  You go, that's really cute.  I know.  The first thing, a little bulldog with one of those little, those little one black eye,  I just find that cute.  See, I just think, God, what the hell did she say to the fourth quarter of a game?  I brought that on.  Nice.  Hey, I see Christmas gifts all over the studio today.  What's going on?  E-Rock said that we got some Christmas gifts.  Oh, great.  These always suck. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, we get the worst Christmas gifts, so now we open them live on the show.  Not always.  I won't say always.  What the hell is that?  I know Caroline's came through with the bottles of Dom again.  Did they really?  Yeah.  I wouldn't know.  Oh, shit, Jimmy.  Well, that's after we bitched about their first gift, so they went for a second gift,  knowing how important we are to their livelihood.  I think whatever they ordered, the first one was online, it must have been called Basket  of Shit.  Just like, I wonder what's in this.  Make it sexy.  Basket, oh, shit.  Basket, oh, shit. 
[02:21:30]  But the shipping still was like $25.  Yeah.  I think it was a re-wrap myself.  E-Rock, what's the matter?  Having a problem?  No.  What is this?  Nice little bags.  This is a big shipment of wines from Dr. Steve.  Uh-oh.  Get wine.com up, Danny.  We're going right to wine.com.  Are these the real ones?  Let me see.  Yeah, because he made homemade wine that we hated.  Wow.  Yeah.  If this is a Shiraz, I'm pressing it.  No, if it's a Shiraz, I get it.  Oh, shit.  Some Italian wine. 
[02:22:00]  Look that up, Danny.  Oh, mamma mia.  Wine.com, baby.  But I think your wines are different than the wines that everybody else got.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Of course.  Oh, what did you guys get?  Where's my gift?  Fermented grape juice?  Yours is, uh...  Where's my gift?  It's coming.  It's different.  You know, if you're going to send me wine, you've got to send the receipt to save me time  on wine.com.  When you go...  Oh, he goes to wine.com and checks the price.  Hey, hi.  How you doing?  This is Lily.  We...  She might be working for our show.  We're not sure yet.  What?  We're not really sure yet. 
[02:22:30]  Is the trade going through or something?  I guess she assumes that the trade went down because she's handing in instant feedback.  Yeah.  Sam, is the trade officially done?  We didn't sign off on no trade.  Well, yeah.  I did the negotiating for this one.  Oh, you did?  Oh, you did?  We gave up a stapler and a pack of tissues and a Snickers bar.  That's what they wanted for you?  Yeah.  That's how much I coughed.  That's the going rate, huh?  Really?  Wow.  Manifes gave you up for a stapler?  It's a terrible economy. 
[02:23:00]  We don't have much money.  Are you going to do the cock thing with us today?  I will do the cock thing.  I will personally check the intern's penis size to make sure they're not lying, as Jimmy guesses.  We've got to, like, take her for a test drive and then decide, Sam.  I mean, you can't be making trades for us.  Well, Eastside Dave was negotiating for Mr. Ron Bankton, so I figured I could negotiate for the, you know...  Well, you figured wrong, my friend.  You stepped up.  We'll take you for a test drive, then we'll decide.  What's wrong there, Ryan?  I got a bunch of cock rings from somebody. 
[02:23:30]  You did?  Cock rings?  What?  I don't know.  A man sent me a...  Thank you, Anthony.  A bunch of cock rings.  What are you going to do with a bunch of cock rings?  I don't know.  I've struggled.  We have.  We all have.  Are they pre-used?  Are they...  I think they're green cock rings.  They've been used before.  They've been used before.  I want some honesty today from everybody in the room.  Who has used a cock ring before?  I never have.  This is actually for someone who's ever held one.  I've never...  I've never...  Have you?  No, I've had one bashed up against my lips. 
[02:24:00]  I'm kidding.  I was like...  I like your hat joking after that.  Oh.  You could use a bunch of them and coil them like those Africans do it.  Oh, yeah.  To stretch their necks out.  To stretch their necks out and you could stretch your dick out.  Ant, my good news, my bottle of wine on wine.com or a site that's similar.  Yeah.  $33.  Wow.  That means like...  Online, $33 means liquor store.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  $60 means restaurant close to $100.  Same one?  What do you got?  $34.  $34.  $34.  $34.  $34.  $34.  Monte Degliangeli Barolo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  These are vibrating cock rings, by the way.  Vibrating cock ring?  Now you're talking.  Hold on.  It looks like a really inexpensive engagement ring.  Yeah.  It is.  It's a big, fat finger.  Yeah.  Very stubby thumbs.  How do you vibrate it?  I think you have a little thing here. 
[02:25:00]  You have to turn.  Well, I'll let you know shortly.  Turn.  Pop that on and...  Here, I'll pop.  How big are they?  Jimmy, if you pop one on, I'll pop one on.  Yeah, I hope so.  Hit it with barbed wire.  Well, sometimes they make them out of metal.  Greg Gutfeld, will you put on a cock ring?  Do you want to see our interview?  Perhaps.  How do they vibrate?  We don't need to see your penis or something.  There's a vibrator in there?  Let me see.  Let me feel the vibration thing.  How about I put it on first?  You can just check it.  With your mouth.  Check it with your face, motherfucker.  Are you going to put one on?  All right, I'll put one on.  Give me one of those cock rings. 
[02:25:30]  Are we putting these on?  How about we just tape two together?  Dude, do you have an extra wall?  This ain't fitting me.  What?  Well, they're stretchable.  They stretch.  Oh, all right.  Well, yeah.  Are you supposed to put your balls in it, too?  I think you are.  I have no idea.  I'm going to sit this one out.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  I want to put this on right now.  I just sit here with this fucking thing vibrating on my dick.  I got a letter from the guy.  All right.  Dear Mr. Norton.  Great meeting you.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:26:00]  I noticed the problems you had while sticking your penis in my ass.  So to prevent further difficulties, I just miss Art.  Dear Mr. Jim Norton.  Father Leahy.  Dear Mr. Jim Norton.  I would like to introduce myself.  You know me as Mom.  My name is Arthur whatever, and I've been a big fan for years, and Opie and Anthony.  I'm currently unemployed and going through some tough times.  All right.  Throughout the years, I've made good business contacts.  And apparently, this product is doing well in England.  Yeah.  It's doing well in England.  And the host of the show is ejaculating all over the front of his shirt. 
[02:26:30]  Crikey.  These are called...  All right.  Mine's officially on.  Joyrider Vibrating Cock Rings.  I'm just going to put one on.  I'll be right back.  Have you...  Opie just put one...  I'll be right back, sweetie.  Hey, listen.  I can hear it.  Does it feel good?  Look, if you don't believe me, mine's on.  Oh, my goodness.  Does it feel good?  It feels...  Where are you supposed to put the vibrating part?  I think it's supposed to go against your nutsack.  Because there's like...  Look, there's a little ribbing or little button thingies here. 
[02:27:00]  So I think you pull it to your...  Or you pull it over your nuts and put that on your taint.  Well, this is...  And let it vibrate your taint.  I can't say that this is fun.  I don't see how it vibrates.  I'm amazed at the vibrating...  Oh, there it is.  Isn't it?  You turn it on.  I turn it on.  It's so small.  Mine's on.  Oh, there it is.  Your dick is making feedback.  Your dick is making feedback sound.  What a tiny, efficient little motor.  It really is.  Like, I'm more amazed at how small the vibrating mechanism is. 
[02:27:30]  There's something else you can do with this.  I've got to figure out what it is.  At least put it on.  I don't know what to tell you.  Put it on, Ann.  Jimmy's putting his on.  Just put it on.  No one saw me put mine on.  Just slip it on.  It's too early for me.  Maybe in about ten minutes.  What is this supposed to do, really?  That's too much trouble to put on.  Unless I go into the bathroom.  Slide it on.  Somebody sent me a ball gag. 
[02:28:00]  Really?  Yeah, like an actual, a real one with a, it's a pretty frightening thing.  I can't believe that actually can fit in somebody's mouth.  Yeah, that kind of, uh...  Boy, Pulp Fiction ruined that thing for everybody, didn't it?  Yeah.  The old ball gag.  Whoever was into it anyway.  Yes.  I mean, but watching, you know, Marcellus Wallace get fucked in the ass while he wore one  was a little disconcerting, to say the least.  Let me take the ball for a second.  Oh.  Jesse in Jersey has something on cock rings.  Jesse, go ahead.  Good morning, bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  Hey.  Hey, what did he send?  Two cock rings and a fucking hula hoop for ants running guys? 
[02:28:30]  Hey.  I can't hear.  Now.  I can't hear.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Punch it out.  All right.  Can you hear anything in your headphones?  Uh, no.  Make it all disappointing.  Uh, I...  It's vibrating, but I don't really...  You got it vibrating, Jimmy?  I bet I do.  How's it feel?  It doesn't suck.  What the fuck am I doing wrong?  You probably have the little vibrating thing positioned in the wrong spot.  Where did you do it?  Did you pull it over your nuts?  Of course I did.  The whole thing, and I put the vibrating thing under my balls. 
[02:29:00]  So it's under your nuts.  Yeah, it doesn't feel like much now, but if you had a rock-hard dick and you were fucking,  it's just an added thing.  This is just a soft penis.  Are you getting, like, uh, you know...  Hey, hold on.  I'm also getting the impression that you could put it on this way, so that this little ribby  thing would be hitting her clit every time you...  Oh, please.  Who cares about that?  Turn to the side.  Get your Vaz Devers.  Jimmy, prove it's on.  This is mine.  Where's yours? 
[02:29:30]  All right.  Aren't you glad you picked today?  Oh, yeah, be careful.  There's a little twist thing, and you don't want to grab your bag skin and turn.  Oh, you didn't turn yours on?  No, I did.  Mine's all right.  I did, but I just turned it off.  What's weird is Jim is staring intently at the CNN anchor while he's doing this.  It's an old man.  I'm just going to put mine over the top of my wine bottle so I can drink and put on my  cock ring later. 
[02:30:00]  What has happened to our generation?  Wasn't normal sex enough?  Yeah, at some point.  I think back in the 1800s.  After the Industrial Revolution, when we figured out things like cock rings.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, five bucks.  E-Rock, pick it up with your teeth.  I took mine off.  I don't know.  Hope he threw his on the floor.  Now, look at it.  Now it's in a circle, like fucking...  E-Rock, put that on eBay.  Poor fuck's got to pick up that.  Someone's saying we're using the cock ring wrong.  What?  You put it on your cock and balls.  I did that.  Josh, there's no way to use it wrong. 
[02:30:30]  It's like a fucking...  Rorschach test.  Josh.  No wrong answer.  Josh.  Yes?  What's up?  Hey, Josh.  Hey, I think the vibrating part, you're supposed to turn it upside down so it touches a woman's  clit.  Yeah, see?  I said that.  That's what I was thinking.  I was thinking of the woman.  Thank you.  Yeah, fine.  You do that.  Right now, I'm getting a sensation.  It's going all the way through my weenie and my bag.  Up your taint?  You got it going all the way up the wiener?  No, well, it's just...  Yeah, we're not having sex, so if you're having sex, you might feel different. 
[02:31:00]  E-Rock?  I'm punching out.  You want to help him out?  Hold on.  Are you here on the floor?  Wait, what is that?  What is that?  That's my...  Is that your vibrating one?  Yeah, listen.  It's crawling across the floor like a red tarantula.  Sounds like shattering teeth.  I took mine off and threw it on the floor.  Where's my...  It's Larry King's heart.  It's jumping around.  Yeah, it's some kind of fucking pacemaker.  Yeah.  That was the first time I ever had one of those on, and I don't know.  I don't really know.  Well, I think you're supposed to have a big boner. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  And then it'll be a different thing.  What other Christmas gifts we get there?  Yeah, what do you got, E-Rock?  Dr. Steve did very well with the wine.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  I don't know.  What is it?  I think jumping around on the floor.  It's making me...  It's going to bite me.  That's my bubble wrap.  Someone's going to think it's a cockroach or something.  Stomp it to death.  Yeah, E-Rock.  Do you have any more gifts?  Sparks CDs from Kevin from Connecticut for Christmas.  What are they?  CDs?  Who fucking uses CDs? 
[02:32:00]  Why do you make a mixtape for me?  All right, what is that one?  That's kind of romantic.  That's a DVD.  Point of movie quotes in between us.  Bill.  A copy of Bill.  And Bill on his own, the sequel, which I didn't like as good as the original Mickey Rooney,  Bill, where he plays the retard, which is fantastic.  Mickey Rooney as a retarded old man.  We're talking about how he was in the institution getting kicked in the guts.  And they would kick me down the stairs and kick me in the guts.  Listen, Kevin from Connecticut on NCP Back. 
[02:32:30]  They're not cock rings.  The gift is from Del Griffith.  Aha, shower rings.  Very good.  Hey, wait, I want to read my mixtape here, Ant.  I want to read this, Ant.  Yes.  Is this from Kevin from Connecticut?  Yeah.  These are the songs he put on my mixtape.  Sniffing the Tears, Driver Seats.  Nice.  You like that one?  Screaming Trees, Dollar Bill.  Nice.  Split Ends, I Got You.  Caroline Spine, Sullivan, what's that? 
[02:33:00]  What?  Nirvana, Where Did You Sleep?  I like that.  Three-pound thrill from Diana.  The song Diana from the AF Days ad.  Yes.  Alice in Chains, Nutshell.  Mad Season, Wake Up.  Nirvana, Something in the Way.  Thomas Dolby, one of our subs, are missing.  All right.  I'll play that.  Thomas Dolby's good one.  She blinded me with Governor.  Oof.  All right.  No, not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad.  That's it for the gift?  The face hit.  I just never thought in the morning I'd be watching you with your hands down your pants. 
[02:33:30]  I know.  It's fucking creepy.  I'm actually rolling the cock ring over my fatter than you think it is, Dick.  I didn't know what to think with the cock ring on there vibrating like that.  Am I doing it wrong?  I actually bent my cock in half and then just wrapped the cock ring around and started  putting pins in it.  Is that wrong?  Yes.  Might be a little bit.  A little bit.  I love hearing that.  He was making popcorn or frying bacon.  Or it sounds like nice rain, like on a gutter.  Exactly.  When you're laying with that someone special. 
[02:34:00]  They say this is soothing.  Yeah.  That's the added benefit of a cock ring.  It's soothing.  If you can't sleep, you throw it on the floor and let it chatter away.  What was the other gift you got, Am?  No, this is a Keith the Cop one.  Very good.  So I'll steal that.  Brian in Rochester.  The home of Brother Weas.  What's up, Brian?  I just used this thing on Sunday night.  It is just a wet, hot mess.  It doesn't matter which way you put this thing on.  It's just flowing around inside and it did great. 
[02:34:30]  Wow.  The cock ring?  Yeah.  You know something?  It's not technically like a cock ring.  Right.  It's an extra added feature there.  Why not a cock ring, Ant?  A cock ring seems like those metal things that you'd have to, like, they look like they  hurt, a cock ring.  And it looks like if you have a huge boner, you can't get the cock ring off.  Yeah.  This would come off.  Yeah, that would come off.  You could snip it if you need, you know?  Greg, why didn't you put yours on? 
[02:35:00]  What are you, a communist?  I've got to wake up first.  I'm a communist.  It's the difference.  This is the difference.  That's what makes, that's what keeps us free.  Exactly.  Cock rings, my friend.  What are you, Methodist?  What's wrong with you?  They're all scared right now in the Ukraine they're going to be forced to put on cock rings  while Putin watches.  Putin watches.  Well, it'll be our little secret.  The next time you do red eye, just tell the people you will have your vibrant cock ring on.  I will wear this tonight.  You're not going to acknowledge or say it, but it will be on, right?  Yes, absolutely.  Good.  I'm not on until tomorrow. 
[02:35:30]  Who is on tonight?  We have Joe Francis.  Oh, the guy from Girls Got Alone?  Yeah, he's on.  And Dr. Michael Bodden.  The great, one of the greatest.  We had that ghoul on.  He is awesome.  That's creepy.  We love him.  He is so awesome.  I'll tell you everything you need to know about dead people.  Whenever there's a famous dead person, he's had his hands in it.  Yeah.  I mean, he's been in, he's played with their livers.  Oh, he knows.  We did the interview.  He's great.  We talked for like an hour.  And for a guy that knows everything about death, he doesn't give a shit about his health.  Yeah.  No, he's a guy who's breathing. 
[02:36:00]  Well, he's in a rush and he sits down and he's just sweating.  Yeah.  It's scary.  He's not watching his calories.  Yeah.  He don't give a shit.  And now we'll.  He must know something that we don't about death.  Yeah.  Like when he realizes that all this diet stuff is garbage.  Yeah.  He's probably why.  He's cut enough people open.  He probably watched a soul just escaping.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Good enough.  Good enough.  I'm sold.  Right.  These also make great earrings.  Oh, shit.  You put it on.  You're going to hurt yourself.  Don't turn it on.  I can hear everything. 
[02:36:30]  That looks like a weird hearing.  What's that?  I can't hear this buzzing.  It looks like a miniature phone.  Like you've got the highest tech.  A Bluetooth.  What's going on with my concrete?  B-L-E-W.  Is it moving around?  It's spinning in place.  It's just spinning in a circle.  Sounds like a.  How do you say it?  A Geiger counter?  Yeah.  Oh, a Geiger counter.  Yeah.  Sounds like Gregory Hines after a few lines of coke.  Just irrelevantly tap dancing in a circle.  Tiny Gregory Hines. 
[02:37:00]  Tiny Gregory Hines.  No one even knows or cares that he's dead.  We've got great gut felt from Red Eye in studio.  Anyone else on what the vibrating cock ring sounds like?  Anyone?  We'll have a few more.  What else are you guys paying attention to with the Red Eye lately?  Ah, jeez.  I love the Adolf Hitler story from last night.  Did you hear about that?  Oh, it's fantastic, right?  Eastern Pennsylvania has the best racism stories.  Yeah.  That congressman was right.  I lived there for 10 years.  It's a weird culture out there. 
[02:37:30]  That's something to do with the moonshine that they make.  I don't know what it is, but I call it, I always call it Walton's Confusion.  There's any area where you're not sure what era it is.  Like, the Waltons, they were on a farm, but they had a car.  There was a car.  Yeah.  It's only something.  God damn, that makes perfect sense, because I wondered that too.  I was like, what the fuck here is this?  Exactly.  They got a car.  That's Eastern Pennsylvania.  When you're driving around, you're going like, this could be the 50s, 1850s, but they  have cars.  Yeah.  There's a car.  So I think that's, but this guy, I mean, did you see the guy, the father?  He seemed like a young, normal guy, but he's a member of Aryan Nations, and Adolf Hitler 
[02:38:00]  is his kid, and I can't remember the other kid's name.  Aryan Nations.  Aryan Nation.  Yeah.  Or something, Goebbels.  Himmler.  Himmler.  Little Adolf Hitler was adorable.  Beautiful, long hair.  What a little tussleable child that little Adolf Hitler was.  And the stupid store wouldn't put Adolf Hitler on the cake for the poor little kid.  But where's the ACLU?  Isn't this like the perfect case for them?  You know, to defend the indefensible. 
[02:38:30]  Wow.  I wonder if the ACLU, oh, I'd love that and go to them, because they're all Jews.  That'd be a tough call for the Aryan Nation guy.  Yeah, yeah.  They probably would take the case, though.  The ACLU would take it.  Yeah.  They had to take them into all these causes.  They'll take any piece of shit and run with it.  That's one thing they don't seem to discriminate against.  Absolutely.  But they had a weird last name.  Campbell, yeah.  Adolf Hitler, Campbell.  Yeah, I like the Campbell.  The Campbell thing, like an all-American family.  Exactly.  Yeah, the kid's name is Adolf Hitler. 
[02:39:00]  Campbell's, because soup is good genocide.  Well, Greg's going to be hanging with us.  We should take a break, because we've got Maria from the WWE coming in to say hi.  I just saw her walk by.  Hot.  Wah, wah, wee, wah.  Nice.  Oh, come on, guys.  Let's not even go there.  And we should have...  Jimmy.  I think we should have intern David interview her.  Okay.  He does a very good job interviewing really hot chicks.  Are we just going to leave the cock ring vibrating on the floor as a mystery item?  For a few minutes.  Not for a few minutes.  I want to see how long this fucking vibration thing lasts.  Put a little battery in there. 
[02:39:30]  It's been going for about 10, 15 minutes now.  You know the technology that had to go behind that?  I like, like, this was what it took to create the entire space program.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, someone worked on that for the space program, the military, some genius, came up  with something like that, and they were going like, holy shit, you're amazing.  And then a few years later, it ends up in a cock ring.  Yeah.  Amazing.  You leave it on the grave of the scientists.  Yeah, that invented it.  Here you go. 
[02:40:00]  Here's your hard work.  Exactly.  You see Buzz Aldrin with one on each finger?  Because he's wearing it for the original reason.  That's why they called me Buzz.  That's a good one.  That's why Neil Armstrong didn't have his arm, because the original quote was,  one small step for man, I just shot a load in my pants.  And it just didn't come off.  I just made cumzies.  Oh, no.  Neil made cumzies.  Neil made cumzies.  Hey, Greg, you had a Facebook crisis? 
[02:40:30]  Somebody wants you to talk about your Facebook crisis.  I know we're trying to get to a break here.  I just got on Facebook, which I find really silly for grown people to be on Facebook.  And Steve Doocy on Fox & Friends actually talks about his Facebook page.  So I friended him, and he never friended me.  So we created Facebook crisis, which is kind of like the same kind of graphics you'd see  in a war, but it's about Facebook and how this guy won't friend me.  So we've been just going back and forth.  It plays better when you watch it.  All right, well, it's the worst for when you go check out Red Eye on Fox. 
[02:41:00]  The worst, though, is when something works and there's a bit or something, and then somebody  is like, dude, describe that bit, and you know it doesn't work out of context.  Honestly, I didn't even know it was a bit.  I just knew it was something with Facebook.  It might have been a real thing, a bit he's doing.  I don't know.  But obviously, the listener, because I'll get that sometimes, like, what's that joke  you're doing?  And it's just mixed company.  The punchline is, and she was really old, and she fell into a burning well.  It doesn't work without context.  All right, we're going to get Maria in here, and we're going to get interned David to ask  her a few questions.  David, you'd all be dead if it wasn't for my son, David. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I'm good until, I think, 10 or so.  Okay, that's it?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were doing the whole show with us today.  No, they told me 10 o'clock.  All we did was cock ring for you.  Who told you 10?  Josh.  Joshua.  Oh, you're going to.  Blame Joshua.  Wait, you have to be somewhere at 10?  I've got to go, but I don't even want to tell you what I have to do, because it's embarrassing,  but it has to do with the Christmas show.  I'm going to have to write something for a Christmas show.  Really?  Yeah.  The Radio City one?  Oh, I love when they're like the little soldiers and they fall down. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Ugh.  How dated is that stupid fucking thing?  Yeah.  I saw a commercial for the newest one, and now they even got, like, on stage, they got  a double-decker bus to represent, like, New York City, because that's really the best  thing about the city, are those goddamn sightseeing buses.  Hi.  Hi, Maria.  Hello.  Jesus, you're hot.  She's lovely.  Holy shit, Sam.  You wouldn't care.  Hi there.  Promoting tribute to the troops, right?  Yes.  We suck when we have to talk to hot chicks. 
[02:42:30]  We got a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm a hot mess.  We're the worst.  Dude, we're the worst.  We always have been.  What do you do for the WWE?  I don't watch it, like...  I'm a wrestler.  Oh, you do a wrestler?  Okay.  I do.  I actually had a match last night.  How'd you do?  Not so good, but I did get a good slap in.  I busted open the side of her mouth.  Wow.  Pretty happy about that.  Who were you fighting?  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  She's like a hotter version of Lindsay Lohan.  Do you notice that?  Yeah.  If Lindsay Lohan was really beautiful, that would be you. 
[02:43:00]  If Lindsay Lohan...  Yeah, if she didn't have all those freckles and stuff.  I don't mind freckles.  I hate freckles.  I actually have a couple.  Even her freckles are hot.  Geez, that wrecked everything.  I'm out of here.  Do you date only wrestlers?  No.  What kind of guys do you date?  Well, I'm dating a guy right now that's a cameraman, so...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Someone that understands.  You know?  Someone that understands my business, because I'm gone like 250 to 30.  300 days a year, so you have to understand that, hey, honey, see you later. 
[02:43:30]  Two weeks gone.  Wow.  Do you beat him up?  Yes.  You're not small.  Yeah.  Because you can be on the road, like, banging, and now, you know, you've got the camera guy.  It's not...  For women, it doesn't work that way.  Yeah, it's not like a...  Oh, what?  ...guy.  You don't see a hot guy in a town and go, oh, yeah, I want to get that guy.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Except for you, Jeff.  Sorry, nothing happened.  Do you know Jim Norton?  You ever see him on TV?  He's on HBO.  He's comedy.  He's comedian.  When you hear this noise.  Sorry, I don't really watch. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah, that's good news.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you know, baby.  Yeah, when the voice goes up...  Did you ever see him?  Oh, baby.  I saw you brought the bully paddle in here.  I saw it over there.  I wanted to go play for a minute, but, you know.  Well, you can.  You want to spank one of our guys?  Are you a spanker?  You're probably more the spanky, because you're very, very dominant, like, in your life.  If you're probably the one who prefers to be spanky, that would be my guess.  That is very psychoanalytical. 
[02:44:30]  But I'm only from what I've noticed...  And completely wrong.  It could be wrong.  Hey, it could be wrong.  I don't know.  But I would take her to be, like, a sub, just because she's obviously a very dominant...  Wow.  Alpha male, female.  I have to say, you might have pegged me.  Nice.  But I do mind...  I don't mind the other side.  Sure.  You know?  I think most people kind of flip a little bit, unless there's something psychologically  wrong with them.  Most people kind of a little bit...  So your really dominant boss probably is at home going, I'm a little schoolgirl.  I'm a little schoolgirl.  Yeah.  A wife with a strap on.  Yeah.  Really giving it to them. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, dear.  Oh, I fired three people today.  Did you step over the vibrating cock ring?  Huh?  On the floor.  Watch out for the vibrating cock ring.  It's actually off now.  Oh, yes.  There it is.  Yeah.  It started off finally.  And there you have it.  Oh, it did?  Do you get offers to, like, pose nude?  I did Playboy, actually.  Holy ass.  That's right.  I thought you looked familiar.  All right.  Spare our naked pictures up.  I did.  I pull our naked pictures up.  I actually did.  Because I know what the answer would be if we said, can we see you naked?  So we'll get the pictures.  So how long have you been with the cameraman? 
[02:45:30]  I don't like this.  A little over a year.  Jimmy doesn't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this cameraman.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to see him.  He'll understand.  Hey, man.  I'm out.  Is he here with you?  Maybe.  I want to see him.  He's probably a cameraman.  You know that he would.  He was coming with your boyfriend.  He's actually from New York, so he's in New York right now.  Can I say he's probably a cameraman who is probably an athlete or would have been a wrestler  but has some kind of an injury or whatever.  This guy has got to be in shape.  There's no way. 
[02:46:00]  You're fucking Kreskin?  No, but look at her.  She's around guys who are all in Triple H shape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's not fucking dating.  That's actually a term now.  Triple H shape.  I think your grandmother wants to talk to her for the odds.  Well, why don't you turn the screen a little bit, Danny?  If you were only working with Mick Foley, I'd hit on you.  Holy shit.  Let me see.  That's actually not me.  What?  That's not you?  No, that's not me.  All right.  It looks like you.  No, not me.  Wait.  Turn your head sideways.  I think you're lying on us.  No, that's not me.  Actually, I don't remember taking that particular photo. 
[02:46:30]  Maybe it's a new one.  I don't know.  Maybe it's a new one.  All right.  We'll get other ones.  Hold on.  We'll just spend our time with that.  No, that's not him.  He's in New York, but that's not him.  No.  Is this a picture of you?  That's me.  Wow.  Dear God.  That's me.  Wow.  You have a...  I'll say this very respectfully.  Your hiney is very, very...  You've got a nice shirt.  Well, thank you.  I'm just really interested in the belt.  Where did you get the belt?  It's actually a Dolce & Gabbana. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, really?  DG.  Fantastic.  The belts, Greg?  Really?  Yeah.  Really, Greg?  The belts.  The belts.  It's the only thing I saw.  Really?  The belts?  Really?  There's my boobs.  There's my ass.  Nice belts.  Nice belts.  I love to go shopping with you, really.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  I might have found your Playboy now.  You're wearing a glove on the left hand.  It's like a lace glove.  It's really sexy.  I've got to be honest.  It's very, very sexy that you're wearing that. 
[02:47:30]  Normally, I wouldn't like little hand garnishings or whatever you want, but that is...  Garnishings.  Garnishings.  There's some parsley on her knuckles.  That I would actually like.  You guys would be like, oh, that's not bad.  That means somebody got drunk and punched her foot in the head.  Anybody else want to check out the booth?  We're trying to trick your boyfriend into thinking we're all gay so we can hang out with you.  Oh, very nice.  I like that.  Yes.  Hey, Greg, what do you notice about this picture, you weirdo?  The pumps.  The pumps are amazing.  Are those Manolo Blanix?  Yeah.  I thought those was.  I don't know.  I think those are generous.  Oh, my God.  That is fantastic.  Dear God. 
[02:48:00]  What a big dressing room.  Now, do you normally work in your dressing room nude like that?  Like when you're catching up on your mail, you're just sitting there just completely naked.  Oh, doo-doo-doo, opening my mail.  Oh, shit.  I dropped something.  Let me pick that up.  Some girls are rather naked in our locker room a lot, but yeah, for the most part.  Do all the girls get along?  You know, it's kind of like any other job.  They don't.  They all hate each other.  Sometimes you don't like each other.  Bitches.  Women are worse to women in the workplace than men could ever be. 
[02:48:30]  Of course they are.  They're catty, as they say.  Catty.  You guys don't make out with each other backstage and stuff?  Right, or that.  I can't confirm or deny the fact that there has been making out overseas.  Overseas.  Because apparently when we're over there, it's okay.  And actually, the tribute to the troops, I did kiss several soldiers.  Yes.  Female?  No, no females.  Just guys.  On the cheek.  Oh, they were pleasant fun.  They were.  Do you know what they did after they kissed you?  Thank you so much. 
[02:49:00]  They found like a rock.  While they still had it in their memory bank.  Just get a little like, yeah.  I had a mask.  I was like, okay, that's cool.  Get a little fragrance on them.  Yes.  They had to last them.  We're two guys who stand next to each other and smell each other's cheeks, and it wasn't  gay.  It was just the smell of perfume.  Because they need the smell.  Exactly.  So they're just cranking.  I actually told this story this morning on CNN about how the guys over there think our  perfume is the greatest thing.  You just come over and stand there next to you.  Yeah, it is.  You just want to smell you.  Yeah.  Because they smell sand, dirt, dust. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Other men.  It's gross.  Oil, other men.  Gross.  Yeah.  Pretty disgusting.  Sometimes.  So, you know, they.  Bad news for Anthony, though.  I just learned that she kissed Snoop Dogg.  I did.  How was that?  Oh, why would that be bad news for me?  It was right after a match.  Pagging me as a racist?  I don't remember it that much.  Was it a French kiss?  No.  Uh-uh.  Did you get stoned just from kissing him?  Yeah.  He drug tests.  I can't do that.  He has a sense, also, when he walks around.  Yeah.  You were just in Playboy, April. 
[02:50:00]  Uh-huh.  I was.  Of 2008.  Wow.  Did you meet Hugh Hefner?  I did.  Was he, like, connected to a machine and gurgling in a vat of blue fluid?  Actually, rather charming.  Like, you meet him, and he's very nice, and he's like, thanks me.  We get it.  You want to be in Playboy again?  He's not charming anymore.  Come on.  No, he is.  Come on.  I read that he has slept with every single Playmate ever since the beginning of the magazine.  That's what you have to do.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I wasn't a Playmate. 
[02:50:30]  I was a celebrity in the magazine.  And I really don't.  It wasn't my thing.  You know, I wasn't always growing up going, I want to be a bunny.  You know, that wasn't my thing.  They asked me once.  I turned him down.  They asked me again.  I turned him down again.  And then finally, they're like, come on.  We want you to do it.  We'll let you have your say in it and what you want to do.  It was all about having your say, wasn't it?  Not the money.  Yeah, you know, I wanted my house, too.  Was the money good?  It was good money?  You know what?  It was... 
[02:51:00]  Six figures?  Same as, like, all the other girls.  Five or six.  Yeah.  You know.  It's a chunk of change.  Can you imagine if we had that in our lives where if we needed to put a down payment on  a house, pose naked, you just get six figures?  That would be fantastic.  It will never happen.  We'd get six cents.  Just calling up Playboy.  You want to see this.  You want to do it?  Yeah.  Hey, we started a new bit Friday.  It's called Kiss Lily.  Would you be in?  No, actually.  I'll be traveling around doing all kinds of other porn and stuff. 
[02:51:30]  No, she's here right now.  I'm here doing the Tribute to the Troops tour.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I forgot about that.  I'm here promoting the NBC Tribute to the Troops.  Look at Lily.  Would you kiss her?  She's very cute.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Would you kiss Maria?  So, Lily, how did you get involved with the Kissing Lily?  Opie.  Basically.  He's my mentor, so I do what my mentor says.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Would you kiss Lily to mentor?  Can your mentor say, blow Jim? 
[02:52:00]  This is holy shit.  That helps somebody.  Selfish.  It's either you kiss Lily or you spank David.  And then we promote, like, Tribute to the Troops Saturday at 9 on NBC.  That's it.  That's all we needed.  How about I'll come over there?  You're going to kiss her?  Possibly.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Go over there. 
[02:52:30]  Okay.  So, Jimmy can really see this.  Look at David.  Oh, he's got the camera.  If you don't want to count.  He's pulling it out.  He's like, hey, we got this.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  I've already been on camera kissing.  We don't give a shit about the listeners.  If you want to kiss her without a camera, we'll shut that camera off in a second.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm about to kiss Lily.  All right.  Can I sit on your lap?  Let me sit back in my seat here.  Go ahead, Lily.  Sit on.  There you go.  Okay.  Now, no tongue in me, okay?  No tongue? 
[02:53:00]  Huh?  I'll be gentle.  All right.  Yeah, just very...  I'm frightened by her.  She's like, let me sit on your lap.  She's got an energy about her.  She's nuts.  We traded for her.  We traded?  What did we give up, Sam?  A stapler.  A Snickers bar, a travel-size pack of tissues, and a stapler.  And a stapler.  You are very valuable, honey.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Joe, you like this?  Did you floss and brush and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  After everybody else you kissed?  No diseases that we know of, so...  That you know of?  Yeah.  I've been dusted.  Why don't you paddle David and stuff? 
[02:53:30]  Huh?  Paddle David?  Oh, Joe's getting involved.  Oh, damn.  Joe is the buzzkill.  I was just afraid I didn't hurt him.  Cock-blocking motherfucker.  No shit.  I heard him fine, but...  Well, this will be the last time we see Joe in our studio.  Guys.  Wow.  Well, we do have Lily sitting on Maria's lap, so...  Be gentle, all right?  How about just, like, a very nice, sensual kiss?  Just, you know...  Jimmy?  A nice little...  Hair sucks.  Oh, wow. 
[02:54:00]  Okay, that was...  Was that good?  That was very sweet.  That was nice.  That was sweet.  There was some...  Huh?  How was that, Lil?  That was nice.  Her lips are so soft.  I mean, women's lips are just so much softer than guys.  There's no cheese.  Double.  No...  Depending on who you're kidding me.  We didn't get to see though, because your hair was in the way.  I'm sorry.  That was just a process.  That was it.  That was it.  That was just a process from...  No, that was...  Dirty, filthy Lily.  You think like a guy.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  That was a prank.  That's what I would have tried on you.  Yeah.  Okay, now time for the real thing.  I didn't mean it.  I just...  That was just, you know...  Our Kiss Lily bit has taken off.  I like this.  I like this.  Wow, Kiss Lily's a fucking home run.  It sure is.  David, come on in here.  This is intern David.  He's very uncomfortable in his own skin.  On Friday, Maria...  This is just like doing a CNN interview, right, by the way?  Just like being on CNN.  Yeah, yeah.  On Friday, David, why don't you tell Maria what you did? 
[02:55:00]  On Friday?  Yeah.  Okay, on Friday, we went to the massage parlor on Friday.  Okay.  What type of massages?  It was the massage parlor.  It's like a regular...  It's a regular massage.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  With a little...  Happy ending?  Yes, with a happy ending, yes.  Oh, see?  I don't know what's called a massage parlor.  It was a massage with a happy ending, yes. 
[02:55:30]  And he enjoyed the hell out of it, Maria.  I'm sure.  Did he come to work the next day feeling much better?  Uh, yeah, you felt much better afterwards, right?  Yes, that's correct.  I felt much better.  I certainly did.  Maria, just so you know, he has never been with a woman.  He kissed one, right?  Yeah.  But this was the first time that, um, you know, he was...  He made cumzies with a woman present.  Oh!  Oh!  Cumzies!  Oh, dear!  And he's the frequenter of the massage parlor.  Lots of glasses, bigger hair.  Uh, who, Sam? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah!  Well, Sam went with him to just do, like, a pre- and post-interview.  To make sure everything went smoothly.  Yeah.  And was he, uh...  Because I missed the, uh, the post-show to that.  Yeah.  Was he just thrilled to death?  He was on cloud nine.  Yeah?  He was a new man.  Yes, sir.  You enjoyed it very much.  I enjoyed it.  It was a very good time.  Very different than, uh, yourself, right?  Yeah, it's much different.  Yeah, much different.  What was your, uh, best part?  What was your favorite part about the whole thing?  Because at one point he goes, he was getting a massage, and then, uh, the masseuse, the 
[02:56:30]  whatever, said, turn over, and that, and David thought that meant it was over.  The massage was over.  What?  Are you crazy?  No, that's when it just begins.  Right.  Yeah, right.  So, uh, how long did it take?  It was a long, the whole entire thing was long.  No, no, I know, but from the time, uh, that the real action started, not the massage part, 
[02:57:00]  but, you know, the, the happy ending started.  How long until the happy ending?  It was a good time.  It was a bunch of time, like a good seven, eight minutes.  Wow.  Seven, eight minutes or so.  Seven, eight minutes.  We define bunch of time differently.  Yeah.  Seven, eight minutes.  Seven, eight minutes of her cranking.  Yep.  Yeah?  Did she use, uh, oils?  She certainly did, yes.  Now, uh, an old friend of ours described this, and at the moment, they have a tendency to say some weird stuff, 
[02:57:30]  like the famous, wee!  A wee!  Oh, like a volcano!  Yes, what did she say to you?  Uh, she did not say that to me.  What did she say to you, David?  Uh, well, in the middle, at the end, she said, oh, good job.  You did a good job.  Good job.  That's what she said.  What's there to do?  You're on the bus, too.  You lay there and...  Good job.  Well, as she was, as she was doing it, she was giving me a countdown as she was doing it.  Really?  I guess she's like, oh, there's only five minutes left.  Hurry up, hurry up.  Oh, my God.  And then later on, she's like, two minutes left.  Two minutes. 
[02:58:00]  You got the two-minute warning.  Wow.  Two minutes to launch.  She was giving me a countdown, yeah.  Ignition sequence.  Yep.  Bye.  I want you to look Maria right in the eye, and she's, of course, promoting WWE Tribute  to the Troops Saturday at 9 on NBC, right, Joe?  And tell her, you know, how it, you know.  Tell her how it went?  Well, how you described it on Friday perfectly.  The whole entire experience? 
[02:58:30]  No, just the moment of, you know, it wasn't that impressive.  What?  It was impressive, yeah.  How far did you shoot?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're talking about that?  Yeah.  Okay.  It was impressive.  It didn't necessarily shoot out.  It was like a volcano.  But it was impressive, yeah.  Okay.  You didn't fire it across the bow or anything?  No, I did not.  No, I did not fire it, no.  It was like his balls just threw up.  That's a good explanation.  Weird, weird.  That's a good explanation, yes. 
[02:59:00]  You'd be a great doctor.  I really did.  You know what part we forgot to talk about?  What's that?  You went into the locker room and there was a naked man in there?  When I, when I, the first, when I first went into the locker room, there was a naked man that greeted me.  I was greeted by a naked man, yes.  Getting on, getting on, getting on dressed.  How did he greet you?  He didn't greet me, I just.  How do you do?  He didn't greet me.  I am naked.  What did you say?  He didn't go to the locker room.  No, no, he didn't greet me.  Isn't there, you don't meet each other when you're naked? 
[02:59:30]  Yes.  You don't.  No, he didn't greet me.  That's not a greeting.  He didn't greet me.  Like, he didn't, like, say hello or he didn't talk to me.  They told me to go into the locker room.  They pointed me in the direction.  I walked there, went into the room, and there was a naked man staring me right in the face when I walked in.  What did he say to him?  He didn't say anything to me.  Hey, could you choose the woman you massaged you, or was that just arbitrary?  No, I didn't get to choose.  No, they said, okay, go down here, and then there was a woman waiting for me.  How did she look?  I didn't get to choose.  She was all right.  Yeah?  Just all right, yeah.  Just all right.  Not great, though, right?  Not great, no. 
[03:00:00]  Just all right.  On a one to ten, what do you give her?  One to ten?  I probably give her, like, five.  That was his first one, so she's probably a three.  And David was getting frisky and everything, right?  Yeah, I was.  His lack of experience shone through right before he went in.  I asked him what kind of girl he was after, like, physically, and he was after a blonde-haired,  blue-eyed American girl with big breasts.  Well, that's not going to pan out in the song's parlor. 
[03:00:30]  He was basically hoping for Maria if she had blonde hair and got something very different.  Do you like Maria?  She's a very beautiful, talented wrestler.  Thank you.  Tell her about the table shower before you ask her a couple questions.  The soldiers would have sooner found that on Okinawa than in the massage parlor.  What's that, Ope?  The table shower?  Yeah, you were excited about the table shower.  I was excited about the table shower because Bob Kelly highly recommended the table shower  to me.  Loved it, right? 
[03:01:00]  According to Bob Kelly, he loved it, so that's the best time, the best part of the whole experience  is the table shower, according to one Bob Kelly.  That's because Bob lays there like a fucking, like a beast whale and just gets water dumped  on him.  Oh!  Awesome.  Yeah, it looks, it's like the deck of a ship when they're taking a whale back out.  Spilling water on him only makes fat guttural noises.  Dude!  Well, what was it there, dude?  The table shower's not at all as hyped up to be as Bob Kelly made it.  Oh, really?  It was three buckets of, three giant buckets of water poured all over me. 
[03:01:30]  That was it.  Oh, the table shower sucks.  I lay down on my back, poured a bucket of water on me, turned over, poured another bucket  of water on me, stand up, poured another bucket of water on me.  That was the end of the table shower.  Wow.  Really?  Thanks.  Like a scallop before the east.  The table shower was probably one of the low points of the whole experience.  It's some kind of practical joke where they go, if the guy asked for a table shower,  just pretended something, we throw water on him.  Yeah.  Did that cost extra?  No, the table shower did not cost extra. 
[03:02:00]  I asked about a table shower when I walked in, they go, oh, it's included, and it's included.  Oh, great.  It's included in the hour, they said.  Right.  We get it.  It's included.  What did you want to ask, Brady?  Because I know you wanted to talk.  You've got a couple questions.  Definitely.  You've definitely got a couple of questions.  He's got paper.  Yeah, I wrote down a couple of questions.  How did it make you feel to get to the end of the 2004 Diva Search but not win?  Well, I flipped off one of the girls that was in the contest, so I was pretty upset about it. 
[03:02:30]  But all it did was make me call every single week until they hired me back on.  So I think that it was a good motivator.  Okay.  Is that not good enough?  That's good.  That's good.  That's not.  I like to just follow up.  We're not laughing at you.  It's follow up.  It's amazing.  We'll just follow up.  Okay.  Yeah, that's what we laughed at.  Okay.  All right.  Next question.  I understand you're the host of WWE Kiss Cam.  Can you talk about that?  What is the Kiss Cam? 
[03:03:00]  What do you do?  I actually used to be.  I don't want you to do it.  Oh, not anymore?  Yeah.  So what was it?  I haven't been doing as much of the Kiss Cam.  Okay.  So what was the Kiss when you did it?  What was it?  It was me standing in the middle of the audience picking out people in the crowd to kiss.  And I have to say, one of the funniest ones was here's a guy and his girlfriend and they're  all making out and they separate and the guy goes over, pulls her top down.  Luckily, we were in break, so it didn't ever make it out of here. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, luckily.  That's unlucky.  But it was just, yeah, there she is.  Wow, he pulled her top right down?  Pulled it right down, yeah.  That's a bit of a...  And you can just, I can just imagine the car ride home.  I can't believe you did that.  No, no, no.  What about a bad car ride?  And then two extremely bearded men, like I'm talking full-on beard, just went out.  It was...  You want David and Hip Hop Ron to kiss?  What?  Look at Ron's like, yeah, that's going to happen.  Ron, how about a little smooch?  Oh, I'm the only one?  How about Peck? 
[03:04:00]  Come on.  David.  Come on.  It's time for the kiss.  Kiss Cam.  It doesn't have to be any tongue.  How about just a peck, like...  Yeah.  Yeah, make that noise.  Sam, would you kiss David for us?  Yeah, I would.  Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.  David, would you kiss Sam?  For the kiss cam.  The Maria kiss cam.  We're bringing it back for a moment.  Oh, for the kiss cam.  Come on, what are you nuts?  What kind of kiss are we talking about?  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dude, it's for the show.  It's not good.  For the show.  For the kiss cam. 
[03:04:30]  There's a difference.  He's moving towards them.  There's a difference.  It's just for the show.  It's not gay.  Yeah, go ahead.  What kind of a kiss are we talking about?  Just a little, like, one way you gotta...  Sam, what kind of kiss would Sam like?  I mean, Sam was eager to volunteer here.  Well, David, it's just for the show.  It's not like a sexual thing, but...  Not at all.  We can go as far as you're comfortable.  The more heterosexual you are, the easier it is to kiss someone of your same sex.  Passionately.  Because you're confident in your sexuality, right, Jim?  Let's see where David is with his comfort zone. 
[03:05:00]  David, what do you want to do?  No, this is kind of...  You gotta touch tongues, at least.  A little bit.  No, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Even if you're just like...  It's not Sam.  It's not Sam.  I wouldn't know if I would touch a tongue with any guy.  But you would touch his lips?  Because that's not as bad.  For the kiss cam.  How about this type of kiss?  Where your lips touch and you make this noise.  I like that.  That's a good one.  I don't know if I do that with any guy.  David, I know you're still new to the radio show, but we made a rule a long time ago.  This type of thing, because it's for the radio, is not gay. 
[03:05:30]  It's not all gay, dude.  It's not the rules.  Don't do it in your private life.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's just a bit...  That's just a bit too much for me.  How about a little, just a little, like, lip-to-lip kiss?  Just a little lip-to-lip kiss.  Sam's gonna do it all the time.  Maria did it with Lily.  I did!  I don't think she's a lesbian.  She's not!  She was having a little fun.  We've all done it.  Yeah, she did it for the radio.  Yeah!  Food for the radio, it's not gay.  Are you okay with it, Sam?  Of course I am, David.  David's very...  Sam's very confident about his...  Hold on, I want to hear this.  I have to hear it, too.  Yeah, we gotta hear the actual kiss, because it is radio. 
[03:06:00]  That's only fair.  Should we give him a little music?  Yes, you're in Philadelphia.  Sam's gotta move to the right a little bit.  Yeah.  There we go.  Like that?  No, like, just move close to him.  Like that.  All right.  Is it on video?  No, it's not.  Quickly.  Not really.  It's just working.  Like I said, it's not gay, David.  It's for the radio.  I know, it's not comfortable for me.  Just go.  Countdown.  Five, four, three, two, one. 
[03:06:30]  Faggot!  Oh, my God.  How gay was that?  Wow, is that gay?  Wow, David.  Jesus, we were testing you.  What the hell?  You failed miserably.  You weren't supposed to take that test.  You failed miserably.  That's really uncomfortable.  That was a bad test.  Apparently, Jews don't use chapstick.  Not uncomfortable.  A little dry lip.  He's not a good kisser.  Not like Bob Kelly, right? 
[03:07:00]  Why don't you moisten those lips a little bit?  Who kisses better, David?  Kiss Sam or Melvin?  Bob Kelly or David?  I'll say Bob Kelly kisses better.  Yeah.  For the show.  Yeah, all right.  David, how was that for you?  Uncomfortable.  What was bad about it?  It's just uncomfortable for me.  Yeah.  Did you get a rod?  No, I didn't.  You sure?  I'm sure.  Did you want to put your arms around Sam's back?  No, I didn't.  Sometimes a kiss feels better like that.  Like, if both people, the problem is this.  The kiss, part of the kiss is people touch each other's backs a little bit. 
[03:07:30]  Wasn't that a dry run, though?  When are you going to do the real thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, that was a dry run, like the Lily and Maria kiss.  David, did you get the urge to kind of pull Sam closer to you?  No, I didn't.  You sure?  A little dry humping.  I'm sorry.  I think he kind of craps out on it, though, because the hand has to be around the back.  It doesn't have to be long.  But you've got to lock hands around the back.  That's what a fucking kiss is.  You know, Jimmy makes a very good point.  What does that make a good point?  That's what a kiss is.  What, are we not kissing here?  What, is it the don't kiss hand?  Oh, there's a shoe thrower. 
[03:08:00]  What, are we atheists?  Oh, yeah.  More questions for Maria there, David?  Of course, she's promoting Tribute to the Troops Saturday at 9 on NBC.  Right, Joe?  Is it going well?  What's that?  Is this whole thing going well, or are you ready to yank her out of here?  You seem a little nervous.  No, I'm not nervous.  She's doing fine.  When is the WWE going to give us our Christmas gift, by the way?  We're paying attention this year.  Didn't she get a wig?  Oh, that was the wig for Anthony.  I sent a wig.  That wasn't a Christmas gift. 
[03:08:30]  We're paying attention.  A wig?  Marie's a Christmas gift.  Having her in studio.  I mean, geez.  Just throw me under the bus.  There you go.  All right, David, more questions for Maria.  Looks like you did some research here.  I certainly did.  Yeah.  I understand that.  Back when you used to interview backstage, you once attempted to interview Kevin Federline,  but were unsuccessful.  Yes.  What is this all about?  I was very unsuccessful.  What is this all about?  David's getting the skinny.  Yes.  Well, I actually tried to go and meet him in his locker room, and he wasn't having it. 
[03:09:00]  Another girl came out of his locker room and said, you're not talking to him, and I got  slapped rather hard.  Was it for the show, or was it real-life stuff?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  David's now sporting the WWE wig.  Yeah.  That's our Christmas gift.  Boy, thanks.  He looked like Jack Osborne in the first season.  Are you serious?  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  That's all he does.  Times are tough, I guess.  All we do for the WWE, and this is what we get for Christmas.  We're paying attention, Joe.  Bring that back to Stanford.  Another question from Maria, David?  Yes, I do.  That's kind of like a Playboy question or something.  Yeah, come on.  Be sexy.  Ask her about, yeah.  All right.  Uh-oh.  I'll play.  What was it like to be like, what was it like posing for Playboy?  Can you talk about that?  It was a great experience.  I was naked.  That was fun, you know?  She's so creeped out. 
[03:10:00]  I'm looking at him with the wig going, I just try and be a little serious, not too serious.  It was fun.  It was a great experience.  I had a good time doing it.  It was fun for me because I was like, I was cool with it, you know?  It was weird.  I thought that I'd be all nervous and stuff once I got there, and when I got there and  I was ready to do the nude stuff, I was like, all right, let's go.  We just did it.  It was fun.  It was cool, too.  They didn't have to put you in one of those weird positions.  Oh, yeah, where they go, oh, they make you stretch back, they make you touch your shoulder 
[03:10:30]  blades.  Actually, there was one pose that actually was not in there, and I was upset about it because  they did have me do one really strange, random, they had like a brick underneath my knee,  and I'm all like this, and yeah, it was very uncomfortable, and didn't make it in the  magazine, so I was kind of hot about that.  I'm like, I did that.  For what?  Yeah, for nothing.  It'd be a private collection.  David?  It was cool, though.  Anything else?  I've got a couple other questions.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  I understand you do a lot of reality TV shows.  You were once on a reality show called Outback Jack.  I was.  What exactly, what is that show?  What was the object of that show, and what did you have to do?  Obviously, a show that didn't make it, David.  It was actually on TBS.  TBS, okay.  Right, I never heard of it before.  I did the research.  Sweet.  Thanks, dude.  Just stab the knife a little harder.  Oh, okay.  No, it actually went pretty well.  I made it to the top three in the show.  It was 12 girls. 
[03:11:30]  A lot of us were city girls that went to the Australian Outback, and we spent a month and  a half in Australia in tents, so it was fun.  Wow.  It was a completely different experience.  A spider tried to attack me in my sleeping bag, and that was rather...  I don't remember that one.  But what was the gist of the show?  Were they hunting you or something?  No, we were going after our Outback Jack.  It was like The Bachelor.  I didn't even know that it was a Bachelor show until I was on it.  Yeah.  They told us nothing about it.  They said, okay, let's do this show, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:12:00]  I think I remember that one.  I think I did watch that.  Imagine if they hunted hot chicks in the Outback, though.  Hunt them.  There's a show.  You hunt them.  Well, not kill, but maybe shoot them with poison darts or something.  Yeah, that would kill them.  Just poison darts, you know.  You made it to third place on that show?  I did.  What would the winner get if they won?  The Outback Jack.  You got the guy.  I'm very glad that I did not get him.  Oh, the guy, okay. 
[03:12:30]  Would you ever do Rock of Love?  No.  No?  That show is so great, though.  At the time, when I was doing that show, I didn't have a boyfriend or anything, and I  would not do a show like that when I had a boyfriend.  That's just really creepy.  How tall is your boyfriend?  A little over six foot.  Yeah, see.  And he's in great shape, right?  He's in good shape.  You're a gym guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, see.  He's a cameraman, but that's not what he's doing.  I thought we moved on from that already.  He's still upset over there.  I want to know who's the guy she likes.  The disgust is Jimmy is with himself.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:13:00]  As he's saying it, he's like, oh, it's a gym guy, and it makes it sound like the guy's  an asshole, but it's Jimmy, like, I'm such an ass.  Freud would say that he's actually jealous of her.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Freud says a lot.  No, Sigmund Freud would be wrong about that.  I want to go back to Greg Gutfeld from Red Eye on Fox, right?  You're talking about Rock and Love.  You hear what happened with Sharon and that Megan chick?  Some kind of assault, but it hasn't been aired yet, right?  They did the reunion show, and this Megan girl, who also was on Beauty and the Geek, 
[03:13:30]  for you reality fans out there.  She's like a lifetime reality.  She basically called Ozzy a brain-dead rock star or something like that, and Sharon lost  her shit.  And the whole show's about how you should, you know, you should deal with your problems  like a woman and not like an animal.  Is she suing her or something?  There's some kind of assault.  Supposedly there's an assault.  Beat the shit out of this Megan chick.  That show is so, it's so amazing.  All these skags together, and they get violent. 
[03:14:00]  They spit on each other.  It's great.  That really is nice.  This wasn't Rock and Love.  This was Charm School, which is sort of like the spinoff of Rock and Love.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, right, okay.  Why would you say that to someone's, like, that's her husband, you know?  Like, how could you?  Especially Sharon Osbourne, who is fucking fierce.  Yeah, she will kill you.  She's fiercely protective.  But it kind of ruins the whole concept of Rock and Love.  Exactly.  Yeah, it does!  You have to look at those shows and make sure your career doesn't go down that path.  Because there's a fine line between those girls, you know, it's a huge pool of these 
[03:14:30]  women fighting for these shows.  And you just don't want to end up in there.  No, you're not a Rock and Love girl.  I don't want to go there.  You've got to be stupid for that show.  You don't seem stupid.  But they float in and out to these shows.  Like, you'll see one of these girls on, like, a Rock of Love, and then they'll be on  a Bachelor, or it's the real life.  You just rotate the girls now.  I like shows like Dancing with the Stars.  Oh.  We don't like Dancing with the Stars.  Okay.  Why do you like Dancing with the Stars? 
[03:15:00]  Because Dancing is the Stars.  But the dancers are obviously, you know, hot and stuff.  But the show is, like, ugh.  Our friend was on.  I was a dancer.  I danced for 17 years.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh.  What kind?  Ballet, tap, jazz.  Oh, okay.  I thought that was.  Yeah?  Any of those involved?  Only in my private times.  Yeah?  Backward pole.  Do you, um...  Good one.  I was going to ask you about dancing.  You have a face on the ceiling?  I was going to ask something. 
[03:15:30]  I forgot what it was.  No, it was actually a real dance question.  No, I think Dancing with the Stars is more like a female show.  It is.  And maybe, I don't know, you know.  It is more of a female show.  Guys that are like David.  So your friend was on the show?  Greg Jeffross.  Uh, Jeff Ross.  Okay.  The comedian, he got ticked off after a week.  And then Warren Sapp.  He was injured.  He got poked in the eye.  Oh, yeah.  I heard Warren Sapp fuck Cloris Leachman.  Did you guys hear that?  What?  Yeah.  It just hit the wire, yeah.  David, another question for Maria, who's from the WWE, of course. 
[03:16:00]  Great gossip.  Yeah.  I want to start the room in the fucking turn with that one.  Stir it apart.  Warren Sapp's mother comes out.  It's not true.  Hold on.  We got someone that, not someone, the guy, it looks like, that took you to Baghdad, Maria.  Okay.  Some guy named Ryan.  Does that make sense from Dover?  What's his last name?  Ryan?  Hey, what's going on?  You actually got Maria to Baghdad?  Yeah.  I was the load master that took her down there. 
[03:16:30]  The load master.  What's your last name?  Because you guys were all wearing last name name tags.  It was Heckman.  You guys sing me happy birthday?  Ah, yes.  I remember you.  Happy birthday again.  Thank you.  Yeah, I just want to say you made that fight like all you girls made that fight, the best  flight I've ever had.  Really?  I'll be everywhere.  Did they have a pajama party or something?  Pretty close.  Really?  We were having some fun on that flight.  So it was like a private flight, right?  We were on a C-17.  So we took a cargo plane over and back. 
[03:17:00]  Wait, from here to Iraq?  How far does this go?  From Washington, D.C.  And we were on the plane eight hours to Germany and then eight more hours, right?  Oh, my God.  It was so uncomfortable in there.  They're terrible.  I flew them when I was in Iraq.  They're awful.  Why don't they give you the comfy seats?  They can't figure that out?  They brought some seats on board that were a lot more comfortable than the first year  I went over, but yeah, it was, we have the ring, all the production guys, all the cameramen,  you know, it was just like everybody, the talent is all on one plane. 
[03:17:30]  It's like you're sitting up against a wall for 16 hours on those flights.  Well, see, a lot of the guys will go in the back and they'll sleep on the cargo and stuff,  especially like the big show, you know?  He's huge and he can't sit in that little seat for that long, so he'll go in the back  and lay on top of cargo and like...  Must look like Con Air.  Nice.  Just a bunch of thugs.  Yeah, it's wild on those planes.  Do you get freaked out how big the plane is?  Like, you're like, how the fuck is this in the air?  I did the first time.  Really?  The first time I went on it, I was like, oh my gosh, this plane's huge and it's, you 
[03:18:00]  know, there's so much stuff on there.  It's like a warehouse in the air.  Yeah, uh-huh, definitely.  And then when we go in, they have to turn all the lights off and they turn it red inside  and then you know you're going to a war zone.  It's insane.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  Very cool.  Damn, that is kind of harrowing.  Is it weird when there's turbulence?  I feel like I'd be like in a house that's moving.  Like, I can understand plane turbulence, but it's something like that.  I would be vomiting profusely.  I could never be in the military for that and I have gentleman's bladder. 
[03:18:30]  I could never do...  Do you know what I mean?  All the things you need to do in the military, which people take for granted, I can't do.  You piss a lot?  No, I just can't piss in front of other men.  That's not gentleman's bladder?  Yeah, it's gentleman's bladder.  Gentleman's bladder.  That's why I could never be in jail or be in the military.  You'd piss eventually.  Yeah, you will.  I don't think it's so much the pissing, it's the open toilet dump.  Yeah, yes.  Where you just got to sit there and, hey, how you doing?  As you're just taking a dump is, to me, I can't...  We don't have that problem. 
[03:19:00]  Pull that one off.  Really?  No, no.  The doors and...  Powder rooms and...  But if they'd solved that, I would have probably enlisted.  That was it.  That was the breaking guess.  That was your excuse, right?  And I can't be drafted.  I've got gentleman's bladder.  Gentleman's bladder.  Ryan, you got anything else?  Please excuse the gentleman's bladder.  Yes.  You got anything else from Maria, Ryan?  Just thanks again for doing that.  And ONA, I've been watching you guys for three years.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you.  Jimmy, I'm a big fan.  You're the shit. 
[03:19:30]  Thank you, man.  And check it out.  All right, cool.  By the way, all the guys should get the comfy seats if they're going over there.  Not just the celebrities, because someone's calling me out on that.  But I've seen those seats.  Uh-huh.  And they look ridiculously uncomfortable.  They're awful.  David, you got one more question for Maria?  I got to take a leak.  Yeah, I know.  We're going to head to a break here.  That's not a big question.  It's just a random question I did during my research.  Just say it.  You once had an incident where you had chocolate milk poured all over you, right? 
[03:20:00]  Yes.  Talk about that.  Like, what was that?  Talk about, elaborate on that.  What happened there?  Chocolate milk was dumped on me.  I was wearing a white tank top at the time, and a guy got overly excited, and he was celebrating,  and he decided to pour his chocolate milk on my head.  Was it something with, like, a wrestler?  Yeah, it was one of the wrestlers.  From, like, one, like, the tag team championship?  Was that real or fake?  Huh?  Was that real or fake?  Yes, it was rather real. 
[03:20:30]  Why did he do that?  He was excited.  He wanted to include me in the specificities.  Somebody told him, too.  I've also been in pudding.  I've had beer poured on, or beer sprayed at me by Stone Cold.  Stone Cold rules.  Okay.  He does.  All right.  We have to take a break.  I think we've got to get at least Greg out of here.  Yeah, I've got to go back.  Do you have to leave, too?  I don't know.  Do I have to go?  Oh, Joe, you're happy now?  I'm very happy.  You were ready to yank her.  I saw it in your eyes.  What are you saying?  What got you nervous?  The lesbian kiss? 
[03:21:00]  That got me a little bit nervous, yeah.  I don't want to go.  I don't want to make wee-wees.  All right.  That's wee-wee.  Greg, you're leaving, staying?  Yeah, I've got to go.  I don't want to go, but I've got to go.  Dude, good first appearance.  We've got to get Greg back.  I'm happy to be here.  I'm happy this is great.  I've watched the Red Eye taping.  He does a great job.  Fox News Channel, 3 a.m., which is...  It's tough on the East Coast.  It should move you up a little bit.  Midnight on the West Coast, but you can always just TVO or DVR.  Yeah, sure.  That's the beautiful thing now is it doesn't really matter when something's on it.  You can just watch it.  It's so true, Jim. 
[03:21:30]  You know, Greg, they've changed TV.  They really have.  We talk about this all the time.  All the time, all the time.  We play when I was a kid about the games.  Exactly.  What do you make me do it nude?  I know.  When I was a kid, we didn't talk about these things.  You know?  And Jimmy's on all the time, like twice a month.  He's on tomorrow night.  He's pretty much a regular.  And, Maria, if you're leaving, we want to at least plug Saturday at 9 o'clock on NBC.  WWE tribute to the troops.  Oh, thank you so very much.  If you're not leaving, you're welcome to stay. 
[03:22:00]  If you stay, we're going to...  But this much is true.  If you do stay, we're going to throw...  Not throw.  We're going to pour stuff on you.  Oh, okay.  I appreciate that.  And, actually, I have to go use the little girls' room anyway.  So, thank you guys very, very much for everything.  And it was a lot of fun.  Just make sure...  Maybe we shouldn't tell her about the toilet cap.  We've got to put it on.  Hey, did you know that that office Christmas party, that's the leading cause of infidelity?  Yeah.

Can I...  You know what?  Now I can say what I want to say.  Well, of course Jimmy will trump me with his fart.  That wasn't me.  Of course it was.  Now I can say what I want to say.  What do you want to say?  And I thought you'd be insulted.  I was ready to say, because she popped up on the screen during that whole thing with Maria from the WWE. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  And I said to myself, and I wanted to say to you on the air, that she looks like the type of girl you would, you know...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how I was looking, going...  Well, no, that's nice.  But then I thought you'd be insulted, because she killed her kids.  No kids.  It's great.  But she looks kind of like...  She's a little bit...  She looks like half the girls on Palsons.  She's...  Except she's emotionally more stable.  God, I'm glad you opened up this one, because I'm thinking... 
[03:27:00]  I really thought to myself, you know what?  That's kind of like Anthony's title.  She's a little too nerdy looking with those glasses.  Without the glasses, she looks pretty good.  If you didn't know what she did, and you just saw her picture, I would like to peg her for a girl that maybe you would kind of like, you know...  Yeah.  I like the no kids thing.  Yeah, I understand that.  I don't care how the fuck they get rid of them.  Hang her?  Fucking duct tape?  Whatever.  Hey guys, it looks like someone doesn't have a secret anymore around here, huh?  Uh-oh, what's that about?  I know this channel's all about having a secret, and uh... 
[03:27:30]  Boy, Sam, you sure don't have a secret anymore, my pal.  Congratulations.  A secret?  I've never had a secret.  Congratulations.  I never had a secret.  You kissed a guy today.  I kissed a guy before.  Well, that was Bob Kelly, though.  Oh.  Well, this is...  No, this wasn't...  You said it was for the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For the show.  David's gay, not me.  Yeah, okay.  I hear there's a little damage control going on right now?  Yeah.  What's the problem?  I guess my girlfriend doesn't like when I kiss guys. 
[03:28:00]  No?  I don't know.  I was texting her, but I think the real problem is that there's been a precedent set for it now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How does that even happen?  She said, you know I've told you before, I don't like it when you do this.  You know, Sam, you come to me a lot.  You're like, I want to be more involved with the show.  Very good news, because we got the new Kiss Lily bit, and now we got the new If You're a Guy, Come In and Kiss Sam bit.  So that's beautiful.  You're on the DL.  No.  You're one of those guys that are on the DL. 
[03:28:30]  Down Low Brothers?  Yeah.  Down Low Brothers.  I want to kiss more guys.  You do?  Oh.  No.  Wow.  All right.  We started the bit, so we'll get more guys for you.  I don't want to do it.  We're trying to get some more girls.  Do I want to kiss more guys?  Sam, we get it.  We've been through this before.  How many times?  That's a recording.  It doesn't even matter if it's a recording.  You kissed a guy today.  Well, yeah.  All right.  I did do that.  How many guys have you kissed now?  Do I want to kiss more guys?  Are you in double figures yet?  Oh.  No.  I've...  I kiss... 
[03:29:00]  Okay.  Three guys.  I want to kiss more guys.  No.  I don't want to kiss anymore.  You know, the more I look at you, you would have been perfect in that movie Milk.  You could have played an extra in Milk.  What type of an extra?  You know.  Like in the club scenes and stuff?  You know.  No.  You had a lot of extras in that movie.  You would have fit in perfectly.  No, I wouldn't have.  Uh-huh.  In the Castro.  All right.  I know what you guys are hinting at.  Oh.  Good twink.  I want to kiss more guys. 
[03:29:30]  It's not true.  God, all right.  We get you want to kiss more guys.  So what's up with Jess?  She's mad at you?  Yeah, she's not happy.  Why?  Well, I guess she thought two would be the cutoff.  Yeah.  But now we're up to three.  You're really up to...  Who's the third guy?  Homeless guy.  Yeah, there's the homeless guy and then Bob Kelly and then David.  You're becoming an addict.  No.  Yeah, you're really enjoying it.  It's just something for the entertainment of others and the audience.  Yeah.  She's been texting me all morning, too.  She's not happy.  Side piece has been texting me all morning and very unhappy. 
[03:30:00]  Why?  Why is she texting you?  What?  What'd you call her?  She's in my phone as side piece.  Side piece?  Sam's trick.  You don't believe me?  Look.  Why?  I saw him.  I don't know.  He put it in that way.  She gave him her phone number.  For real.  This is Sam's girl and that's how she's in my phone.  Side piece?  Side piece.  Yes.  What?  Wow.  Yeah.  At first it was just like a joke, but if she's texting you and stuff, this is not, well,  you know.  Comes up as side piece. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, side piece has been texting me all day today.  That shouldn't be happening.  Not happy with you.  That shouldn't be happening.  Well, it is.  What are you going to do about it?  Just ask you to stop politely if you want.  She's going to go find somebody that doesn't kiss other men is what she's going to do because  she's an attractive girl.  She's going to be gone.  She's going to ditch you for some.  Boy, I'll say.  What do you mean?  Ditch you for some fucking guy that doesn't like kissing other guys and might enjoy a woman. 
[03:31:00]  It's for the sake of entertainment purposes.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Of course.  No.  Yeah.  No.  I don't enjoy it and I don't get aroused and I don't get any sexual thrill from it.  I want to kiss more guys.  When does it get to the point where you're sucking dick for the show?  Oh, no.  It won't.  For the show.  It's for the show.  It's not really like.  Remember our rule?  You're not really sucking dick because you're enjoying it or you're gay or anything like  that.  Yeah.  But just, you know, get a dick in your mouth for the show. 
[03:31:30]  Would the show need it?  It might.  It might.  If it ever came up.  If it came up, then maybe that's something we could talk about.  All right.  Very good.  For the show.  For the show.  Of course.  Hey, John in Virginia, going with that whole milk thing I just threw out there.  Sam could have been Harvey Milk's cousin, chocolate milk.  Okay.  That's two things that I'm not.  And how are you going to write the next primetime gossip about yourself?  Yeah.  Well, I didn't think that would need to come up.  I thought it was just kind of a one and done thing. 
[03:32:00]  We don't need to replay it or bring it up in primetime gossip.  Oh, I think primetime gossip is definitely neat.  It's not like this show takes a tiny tidbit and makes it into this huge thing, Sam.  Primetime gossip.  The mountain out of molehill show.  Right.  Well, primetime gossip was about reporting real news, and this was such a non...  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  This was such a non-issue, I figured we'd just leave it alone.  You really kissed other men.  Yeah, you really did.  You really did.  And we really jerked off watching you. 
[03:32:30]  Twink.  You twink.  Well, maybe there'll be primetime gossip.  And also, I don't know why you're making the trade between us and Ron and Fez.  I just thought I would help negotiate.  You're busy, guys.  This lily thing isn't official yet.  No, I mean, you could definitely let her go, and I could get the stapler back.  What did we give up for her?  A stapler, a travel-sized packet of tissues, and a Snickers bar.  And a Snickers bar.  The Snickers bar will be billed to Steve Carlesi.  Jimmy, you want to do your bit today?  I mean, we headed down this road a while ago. 
[03:33:00]  The cock bit with the interns.  You missed a lot of radio, Ann.  I gather I did.  I was going to guess.  Jimmy's going to line up the interns.  I'm going to guess how big their penises are.  In order of cock size.  How big their penises are.  How did this come about?  I don't even remember.  So I guessed that David was about five and a quarter to five and a half.  And you nailed it.  Of course I did.  Yeah.  Now, is this in an aroused state?  Yeah, when it's full.  I don't want to see.  So how would they get aroused? 
[03:33:30]  No, they're going to just.  Tell them we're going to hire them.  We told them not to lie.  They're going to come in with a piece of paper like this.  With their cock size on a piece of paper.  Yeah.  Jimmy's going to line them up and then we're going to see how close he gets.  We're all going to guess.  Well, I.  Well, it's a fun game.  Oh, what's wrong, Sam?  Well, it's just Ron and Scott today.  Unless we want to play with David and have Anthony guess.  Because he wasn't here when.  No, I just said it.  Jimmy just gave it away.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, we'll try Ron and Scott.  Who's Scott?  He's the old guy. 
[03:34:00]  Our 38-year-old intern?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This is ridiculous.  Doesn't he understand that this business is dying like a dinosaur and he decides to get  into it at 38 years old?  It's dying.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  This is only part time because they have the day he sells leisure discs.  Very good, Jimmy.  I don't want to wreck Jimmy's bit with two guys.  I think Jimmy needs the full crew in here for his, uh...  We never had the full crew.  Who has the biggest, uh, biggest cock there.  We never had the full crew. 
[03:34:30]  Who are we missing?  Uh, Joe.  Joe?  Yeah.  We've got a new one starting on Thursday as well.  We'll have a whole bunch of people on Friday.  All right, we'll do it Friday.  Do it Friday?  All right.  Yeah, the big guess the cock-sized bitch.  That'll keep listening.  Sure.  Oh, by the way, uh, people are reminding us that you are the star of the creepy gay, uh,  kid videos as well.  All right.  That was just a thing.  We forgot about that.  For the show.  Yeah, that's all right.  Yeah, which...  So what if some blogs picked up on it?  It was just done for the show.  It's all right.  We understand. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, Jimmy's got a scab in his nose.  Yeah.  Oh, God, what the fuck that thing is going to be covered with when it comes out?  He's not a doctor, Nicole.  Scabby snot.  Oh, oh.  Imagine it's falling into your cornflakes and you don't realize it.  Yeah.  Eat it.  Sure.  Yeah.  But you get it caught in the fucking molars in your teeth.  Oh.  Because it's all sticky a little bit, the back of the scab.  Yeah, the back where it clings to your nose.  Oh.  Sometimes that gets caught in my food pocket.  Oh, God, that's disgusting. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, a little pussy.  Sorry, I just had a text side piece.  I'm going to throw it out.  What?  Nothing.  I just had a reminder that you were the star of the, uh...  What, a chewy booger ant?  Of the creepy gay kid videos.  You don't need to text her.  Because a scab is bad enough, but a scab booger...  Oh, God.  ...is worse.  Yeah.  And it smells, too.  I'm going to throw up.  Don't do that.  Oh, my God.  You want me to peel it off and smell it?  Yeah.  I will.  Feed it to me. 
[03:36:00]  No, I don't even want to look.  Don't pick at it.  I'm going to the doctor at one.  Oh, yeah.  What's wrong with your nose?  To make sure it's not infected.  It might just be a scab.  I don't know.  Infected.  You don't go to the doctor for something infected in your nose?  Yes, you do when you have sinus surgery.  Of course you would.  Oh, I forgot about the sinus surgery.  Yeah.  All right.  Go right to your brain.  And Jimmy would do his act, and it would suck because he'd be brain damaged, but we'd have 
[03:36:30]  to laugh because we'd feel bad.  Kind of like now.  Yeah, there's a lot of yawning going on.  Let's get this Ashley Madison read out of the way.  I'm fucking exhausted.  Huh?  Oh, we don't have to do that?  Oh, we did that.  Line of the day, or what did we learn on the opening?  Anthony's show is brought to you by DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  Actually, today we'll promote Sam's gay kiss. 
[03:37:00]  What?  Sam's gay kiss was brought to you by DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  I kiss.  Okay, three guys.  You already said that.  You don't have to tell us again.  We got it.  I kiss.  Okay, three guys.  Sam.  I want to kiss more guys.  Why do they keep playing those tapes?  It's not tapes.  It is.  And I don't know how they edited that other clip.  The Victrola's left on.  Do you want us just to advertise for you?  All right. 
[03:37:30]  Sam wants to kiss more guys.  No, I don't.  I want to kiss more guys.  All right, Sam.  We'll just throw it out there.  Come on in.  Any guys on the bleachers want a kiss from Sam?  It can't happen.  All right.  They don't have any other takers today.  I'm sorry.  I want to kiss more guys.  Hopefully tomorrow we'll have a better crew on the bleachers for you.  Side piece will be very upset with me.  What are you doing?  Yeah, she is.  How do you know?  Nothing.  This is not right.  What are we going to do with Lily?  Are we throwing her back to Ronna Fez?  Have we decided?  Not yet. 
[03:38:00]  Let's see.  Let's see.  She just, she gave us instant feedback.  Who gives a shit?  Anyone can do that.  She gives a shit.  Yeah.  She might be willing to do more.  Take her along for ballast, chiefie.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Lily, what else are you willing to do?  We're trying you out still.  Like a good foreign car.  What else do you want me to do, Opie?  Oh, man.  Well, I'd say.  Take out your butt cheeks. 
[03:38:30]  Take out your butt cheeks?  Yeah.  Take them out.  Like.  Are you a fan of her butt cheeks?  I'm a fan of all butt cheeks.  For an Asian, she's got a nice hiney.  She's a nice hiney for anybody.  I've got to be honest.  That's a nice one.  Yeah, that was a big surprise when that was sort of unveiled the other day.  Oh, really?  Well, not the actual ass, but.  No, I didn't.  She was trying out for penthouse the other day.  Were you?  Yeah.  Did they call you yet?  We, I emailed her about going to the dinner tonight. 
[03:39:00]  You would have no problem posing naked?  I would.  But Opie told me I don't have to be full naked, right?  In the magazine.  I was lying.  I was lying.  I'll wear a hat.  I'll wear socks.  I like how Lily is very, she's very Western, and she doesn't have, like, if you just heard  her voice on the radio, you would have no idea that she's Chinese.  Yeah.  So I think it would be kind of funny to, like, force her to talk into her in a stereotypical  Chinese accent every time she's on the air.  I've already done that on the Ron and Fest show. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, wow.  Ron and Fest did it.  Ron and Fest did it.  I don't listen to that shit.  Excuse me.  Right now, I am ONA six to noon for life.  Well, we have the size.  I don't know, for life.  We really did give up a good stapler.  That was one of our, uh...  Yeah, that was one of the red ones from Office Space.  I'm not very excited about that.  Oh, really?  It closed the staple tight, so the papers didn't...  It's one of those red ones.  It was a good one.  Plus the tissues, you could take them anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Just travel size. 
[03:40:00]  Sure.  Travel size.  You could take me anywhere.  Wireless.  What else are you willing to do before we make our decision?  What else do you...  No, not that game.  You have to come up with yourself.  What type of underpants do you have?  Yeah.  Do you wear awful panties?  No.  Prove it!  As of right today, I'm not wearing any...  That was believable.  Oh, you're not wearing any...  Yeah.  Is that why you have no, uh, panty lines?  Yeah.  Obviously.  That must be ass lines. 
[03:40:30]  What kind of panties you got on?  Nothing.  Right now, because I just have leggings on.  Really?  Are you clean shaven?  No, I'm not.  You, you, uh, leave a little?  Yeah, it's...  Right now, it's a little strip.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Very soft.  Wispy.  Is it wispy straight hair?  Yeah.  Very...  It's...  It is soft, Opie.  Ah, you're Asian.  Can you pull some of them out?  What are you doing yesterday?  Jesus.  Can you taste them?  What do you want to do?  I told her just to pull some out so we can look at them. 
[03:41:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, yank a few pubes out.  Yeah, can we yank your pubes out?  Yank your pubes out and put them on a white piece of paper.  Yeah.  That, that would, uh...  Yank a sun out.  That would help our decision.  That would help our decision.  There you go.  And while she does that, I want to...  The listeners are begging for it.  They want to play a little What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show because...  Who cares?  Well, as she yanks the pubes because DirecTV is paying for this and Greg from Baltimore has  a good one.  Yeah, yank him out.  Greg in Baltimore really fast before Lily yanks her pubes out. 
[03:41:30]  Are you strong enough?  You want me to do one for you?  All right, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  I want to call and say what I learned today was that Sam is the perfect addition to the  gay show that is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, there you go.  And I want to kiss three guys.  What?  Come on.  Jesus, Sam.  That was...  Do you want to do it all at one time?  That was...  Not even a good edit.  Ant's on to something, though.  Lily, let's start yanking some pubes out.  All right, just yank some pubes out.  And it's got to be more than one.  Yeah, yeah.  Just grab a hold.  How does anybody even know they're hers unless I watch? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, Jimmy better watch.  But if...  Jimmy makes a great point.  That's a good call.  Is that okay?  Grab...  It would be fine.  Grab like this.  And then just take the pain and yank it out by the roots.  Can I go into a closet and do it myself?  No, no, no.  You've got to do it like right here and then just plop it down on that white paper.  There's ways of doing it.  I put a cock ring on without anyone seeing it.  Yeah, don't sweat it.  Yeah, you...  Don't even look.  Just stick your hand down in front of your pants.  You pull your pubes out.  All right.  And there you go.  And then you throw it on a white piece of paper. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  Okay, Danny.  You going to let Danny do it?  No, he's trying to sneak a piece of paper.  No, I was ducking under the table.  Oh, oh.  It kind of hurts.  It's going to hurt, yeah.  We all know it's going to hurt.  They're short right now.  Well, you said you would do anything.  I am.  Just yank them out.  It's going to be a little painful at first, but...  Wow.  It's really... 
[03:43:00]  You've got to get something.  It's really tough.  Sorry.  Asian hair is just not that durable.  It's straight.  It's...  Yeah, it's very straight and silky.  You'll be able to...  My fingers are sliding off them.  Break it right off.  Just pull tight and pull.  Just...  Just do that.  See what you get.  Do a little...  Okay, okay, okay.  See what you get.  Go ahead.  Wow, nothing.  Nothing?  Come on.  You've got to get something. 
[03:43:30]  I feel like they just...  You want help?  What?  Are they coming out?  Anything?  You're kind of useless to our show, then.  Yeah, just...  I've got to be honest.  Just yank.  I've got to be honest.  I've got to be honest.  Just yank.  Anyone can yank two.  I can...  Within a second and a half, get at least three.  Yeah, yeah.  Guaranteed.  Just putting your hand down there, you get some.  All right, Danny, put your hand down her pants.  Oof.  I don't know.  Why?  I kissed David.  Danny, you can do this. 
[03:44:00]  Good point, Sam.  For the show.  It is for the show.  It is for the show.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  All right, I have something.  You got something?  All right, put it on the paper.  All right, that's one.  Put it on the paper.  Put it on the paper.  You see it?  That's a puke.  It's a little more...  A little coarse.  Yeah, more coarse than I would have expected from an Asian.  That's one of the top ones.  Wow, that's a long one.  Jesus Christ.  And you said it's short? 
[03:44:30]  What do you shave with?  Miracle Girl?  You got Big Hairy Bush right now?  No.  This is one of the longer ones, because all the shorter ones, I can't...  Jesus, fucking ZZ Top.  That's awesome.  ZZ Top.  That's when you would be like...  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know?  Yeah.  But usually, I keep it very clean-shaven.  Yeah?  To me.  Yeah.  But what happened this time?  Why'd you leave it a strip?  Well, I just haven't had anyone down there for a while, so...  Mm.  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  And I've been...  No one down there?  No one down there to graze?  Make it a little shorter.  That's good.  Mm.  Yeah.  Well...  And you need any more hair plugs?  We can get them...  Yeah.  We can harvest them from Lily's.  I can get some follicles.  Can I have some follicles from you?  That would make a good hairline.  Yeah, I'll shave and give it to you.  Asian pubes.  The new method.  All of a sudden you walk around...  Asian pubes. 
[03:45:30]  All of a sudden you walk around with the Pete Rose hair.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, wonderful.  Well, we got one pube out here?  Yeah, we got one pube.  Yeah.  That's a good size one, though.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Maybe Sam could redeem himself and he could be not gay anymore if you put it in his mouth.  Yeah, why don't you put that pube in your mouth?  For the show.  For the show.  That'd be in a lot of trouble.  Put it on your tongue.  Just put that pube on your tongue.  But you wouldn't be gay anymore.  Roll that around in your mouth.  Because on one hand, you guys wouldn't think I was gay. 
[03:46:00]  On the other hand, I wouldn't have a girlfriend to prove that.  Oh, you don't have one anymore.  What?  How do you know that?  And I don't.  Well, she's not happy.  Not happy with you.  I'm making sure she knows everything you're doing, by the way.  Would you makey makey diarrhea in the bathtub?  Oh, we should have her reenact tub girl.  Live tub girl?  Yes.  Live tub girl.  All right, you did say you would do anything.  Live tub girl.  If you do live tub girl, we'll bring you on. 
[03:46:30]  One morning, we'll start off with some raisin bran.  Is she familiar with tub girl?  And smoothies.  I have seen tub girl, Danny.  You're not going to get me on that.  Raisin bran and smoothies.  And some of that shit that No Filter Paul drank.  Yeah, yeah.  And then drink some of that.  And then we'll get like a little portable bathtub or even like a kiddie pool or something.  Tub girl!  Tub girl!  Tub girl!  Tub girl!  Tub girl!  Tub girl!  Come on, yeah.  What do you say?  And then you get in the tub and you make like a volcano. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Like that.  Look at this.  Look at tub girl.  Look at tub girl.  Oh, it's old faithful.  You're so in if you do tub girl.  Oh, my God.  Tub girl rules.  Yeah.  How is that even possible?  What do you say?  Doesn't it look like her ass cheeks are full of liquid?  It looks like her face is burnt like to a third degree.  No, that's just like gravity taking its...  Oh.  Oh.  Tub girl. 
[03:47:30]  By the way, how did you get in here?  Because you're not an intern.  You're not an employee.  Are you a stalker?  That's part two.  Holy shit.  I am seeing part two.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It's everywhere.  Can I see that?  That's the next...  This is the next frame, I guess.  Oh, God.  It's a different, like...  She has different lingerie on.  It's like seeing the mushroom cloud and then seeing the wreckage of Hiroshima. 
[03:48:00]  And the pussy's blocked out.  Of course.  Well, you don't want to be...  Well, it's disgusting, Jim.  You don't want to be dirty.  Jesus Christ.  Who do you stalk around here, for real?  How did this start?  This started as me as a listener of both shows.  And then I went into the studio one day to watch Ron and Beth's live.  And I asked them if I could, on a volunteer basis, do the duties of an intern for them.  Right.  Just so I can... 
[03:48:30]  But you're a real-life stalker.  No, I'm not.  Who does that?  This reminds me of, like, Stalker Patty days.  Yeah.  Are you going to start living in the studio and stuff?  Eat the pube.  I can...  No.  Yes, sir.  I can't put it in your mouth.  You were ready to fucking put a dick in your mouth for the show.  Side piece says she doesn't care.  No.  Because she's done with you.  But I didn't want to read that.  But you won't put a pube, a girl's pube in your mouth.  What are you, gay?  No!  That's so gay.  No.  You kiss men.  You said you would probably put a dick in your mouth for the show. 
[03:49:00]  But I wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't do it today, though.  Redeem, redeem, redeem, redeem.  You got...  Just take that.  It's one single pube.  Put it on your tongue.  Take communion.  Swallow that motherfucker.  And just roll it around your mouth.  I wouldn't put the dick in today.  I'd wait.  Well...  Well, because you can't, because you got to put the pube in today.  Well, why don't we save the pubes?  No.  No, that's...  Where's David?  That's silly.  David!  David!  David!  David needs to redeem himself.  Why? 
[03:49:30]  He doesn't, but...  Because he also kissed a boy.  David?  Hi, David.  You kissed a man today.  Yes, I certainly did.  Yeah, and you need to redeem yourself a little bit and get a little more masculine.  A little more manly.  Okay.  We have one of Lily's pubes here on the piece of paper.  You two met yesterday or Friday.  Yes.  If you would take that pube and just...  Eat it?  Yeah.  Eat the pube.  Eat the pube.  Just eat the pube.  Eat.  All right. 
[03:50:00]  All right.  It's right there.  It is kosher.  Bon appétit.  It's kosher.  No, it really is.  We had it blessed.  There it is.  Just leave it there.  I don't lose it.  We had it blessed by a rabbi.  It's pretty hard for you to fucking get it.  It is.  God, Lily.  There it is.  It's the longest one, Jimmy.  It is a long-ass pube.  Wow, look at David.  On earth.  David.  The longest one on earth.  Stop.  David.  Do you want to just stand in front of a fan for a little while or on?  I'm not going to lose it.  All right.  David got very excited about this.  Pick it up.  No.  Yeah.  Just eat it.  Put it on your tongue.  It doesn't smell. 
[03:50:30]  I can't smell it.  Save it.  Save it.  It doesn't smell.  Put it on the tongue.  Put it on the tongue and kind of roll it around.  What?  What?  It's hair.  I'm not going to roll it.  I'm going to just put it in my mouth and swallow it.  Well, whatever it takes.  Whatever.  Whatever.  It's like matzo.  You're chewing a pubic hair?  No one chews pubic hair.  How do you get them down, too?  See, you know nothing because you haven't eaten pussy yet.  Good luck swallowing that motherfucker.  How many guys have spent like hours trying to... 
[03:51:00]  All right.  Should I try to swallow it?  And they just don't go down.  The dingleberries are a lot easier to swallow.  How are you doing, David?  I think it's down.  You think it got down?  I think so.  You think so.  It's either down or it ain't.  Yeah.  Come on, kid.  David's wearing...  It's down.  It's down.  You did it?  All right.  David's wearing Lily's pubes on his head.  It's down.  It's down.  You got it.  All right.  Good man.  You redeemed yourself as a guy.  Yeah, you like went down on pussy by proxy or something.  Sam, any final thoughts? 
[03:51:30]  I want to kiss three guys.  Oh.  That was recorded.  That wasn't live.  Prove it.  I like women.  David did say that he thinks Sam has soft lips.  And he said that he likes soft lips.  Yes, you did.  Did you really?  Yes, you did.  Do you like the soft lips of Sam?  That was a little bit uncomfortable for me.  Really?  Yes.  But are Sam's lips soft?  You know you blank.  Don't lie.  David, were they soft? 
[03:52:00]  Don't insult people, you know?  You know you blank-lipped Sam.  You know that, right?  Blank-lipped?  Yes.  Chap.  I did, yes.  All right, can we go home now?  Yeah.  It's not enough damage one day.  Lily, not sure about you.  People are saying you're in here.  Don't.  We might want our stapler and what else?  The tissues and the Snickers bar back.  Jimmy, thanks for that huge log you left for everybody today.  Of course I had to make a gift.  We really enjoyed that. 
[03:52:30]  Sam?  Yeah?  Thanks for kissing another guy for our show.  No problem.  Boy, you're a real trooper.  I wouldn't put the dick in today.  Sam.  Baby steps, please.  Look.  Baby steps.  My words are being used out of context.  Yeah.  Baby steps, please.  You're a real go-getter.  Yeah.  Just trying to help.  You really want to make it in radio, don't you?  I wouldn't put the dick in today.  We've got a real go-getter on our heads.  I certainly do. 
[03:53:00]  He has that passion for radio, huh, Sam?  That's what it is.  David, what's the matter?  What's the matter, David?  I don't know.  My throat feels weird after that pube.  You can't quite get it down is what it is.  I don't even know if it's down.  It feels like it's stuck somewhere.  It's stuck in your epiglottis.  It feels weird.  It feels my throat feels weird, yeah.  David, your throat feels weird.  Yeah.  David's a pervert.  So obvious.  Can we confess to David what he really just put in his mouth?  Yeah, I know.  It was a Lily's pube.  No, it wasn't a Lily's pube.  It wasn't.  Do you think a girl, first of all, you've seen some nude girls,  around here, right? 
[03:53:30]  Yes.  And what is one common thing with their pussies?  That they're clean shaved.  They're clean shaved.  That's what girls do.  You know what guys' pubes look like?  Yes, I know.  Do you know what's not clean shaven?  Yes.  Danny's ass.  That hair came from Danny's fucking asshole.  That was a hair that surrounds Danny's asshole.  I thought it was Lily's pube.  We know.  We know you did.  Well, we didn't think you would just eat Danny's fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Would you?  Why not?  It's nice. 
[03:54:00]  I guess I did.  Stay out of this one.  But if we asked you to, would you have?  Probably not, no.  Would you give Danny's asshole, like, a kiss?  No.  Not lick it.  Just like a quick kiss.  No, I wouldn't.  No.  I guess you don't want to work here anymore.  Yeah, I guess you don't.  We've all done it.  Fuck.  Would you kiss Danny's nipple?  No.  Why?  Why?  Dude, we'll miss you, man.  It sucks.  Just a nipple.  That's a bit too much for me.  Ask Sam.  He's done all this and more.  Yes, I have.  Sam will even show you before you do it. 
[03:54:30]  I don't think I really would want to.  I don't really want to.  It's too far.  If Sam kisses Danny's ass, will you kiss Danny's ass?  No.  That's not fair.  No.  How about the nipple?  Just the nipple.  No.  About both of you guys at the same time.  I've already found out that I've done too much.  You haven't done too much.  You haven't done enough for our show.  I ate a few.  One kiss on...  You just kissed Danny's cheek.  That's it.  Yeah.  You don't even have to be near the brown spot.  Kiss his cheek?  No.  Dead center. 
[03:55:00]  Danny, why don't you...  I said dead center on his sinkhole.  Danny, why don't you present your ass?  No.  Present.  No.  Okay.  And present.  No.  My cheeks or my tits?  I would say the tits.  You want my titties?  Would you lick his nipple?  No, I wouldn't.  Why?  What if we blindfold you and you don't know if it's a girl or a guy?  That's a great one.  He'll never have any idea who we put in front of him.  Why would we put a girl in front?  Why would we?  I'm just retarded. 
[03:55:30]  Look at his nips.  David?  I think I've gone too far.  Look at his hairy nips.  I see that.  Sam.  Of course you had to come back in studio.  No.  What?  Did you leave something in the studio?  I'm going to put the dick in today.  You're on a video.  No.  Now that Danny's like topless, all of a sudden Sam appears again.  No.  A peck?  No.  David, you're a poor guy, aren't you?  Yes.  Yeah.  If I were a rich man... 
[03:56:00]  David, there's 20 to start.  Oh.  20 beans.  What do I got to do for that?  You have to lick Danny's nipple.  I'll put in 20.  Wait a minute.  I'm just his nipple.  Kiss his ass?  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  Yeah, what about them?  I'll lick my sweaty balls.  No.  Stop talking and start sucking.  We got 40 bucks on the table, David.  Halfway to your next Yankee cranky. 
[03:56:30]  Yep.  It's not about all the money.  It's nothing to do with the money.  No.  So I'm just saying we're ripping off Vince McMahon.  Kiss my ass.  They do it on WWE and it's not gay.  Sam, tell them.  Oh, it's true.  William Regal did it.  Yep.  You want us to show you the video?  That's all we're doing.  It's the same thing that WWE does, and that's family fucking TV.  Kiss my ass.  If we could prove that the WWE did this, will you kiss Danny's ass?  For $40.  What do I got to do?  Just give a kiss?  Yeah.  A good one. 
[03:57:00]  Like what we're going to show you.  What do you mean by a good one?  Sam, you get to buff Danny's ass to get it ready for the big kiss.  I don't know.  I'll throw you a bone today.  You were good.  I'll throw you one, too.  I think this is a little bit too much for me.  What if we show you the video?  This is family TV.  We're just taking a page from family TV.  What do you do?  You don't like family?  What's wrong with you?  What are you, a...  What are you, a man?  That pubic go down yet? 
[03:57:30]  I think so.  It's down.  You don't know.  How much money we got on the table so far?  40?  40, I think.  Yeah, 40.  You can't use $40?  I could.  All right.  Well, look.  Show the video.  Is it going to be on the big screen?  This is all we're doing, and this is family TV.  What am I looking for?  Oh, you have to just look on the screen.  It's broken.  All right, look.  This is all you have to do.  All right.  Danny, Sam, what is this again?  It's William Regal joins the Kiss My Ass Club.  They had a name for it and everything. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, oh.  $40.  All right, turn around.  Show them.  This is Vince...  Oh, no.  What?  What's the matter?  The pube?  The pube didn't go down at all.  It popped back up, right?  It popped back up.  It certainly did.  It's not down at all.  It's the gift that keeps on giving.  Yes.  It was still there.  It didn't go down.  Swallow it.  I can't.  Hey, look.  Get it down.  Look, this is the Kiss My Ass Club.  Vince McMahon is a billionaire, by the way.  I know.  The pube is...  Just when you think it's down...  The pube is not even down by one of the slightest. 
[03:58:30]  No?  I thought you said it was down.  I thought it was, but all of a sudden it appeared.  I felt it on my tongue like 10 minutes later.  Swallow that.  I can't do it.  I need some water to swallow it down.  It's not going down.  You're not going to get water.  If you go down on a girl and you get a hair in your mouth, what are you going to do?  I didn't swallow the pube.  You can't make the spitting sound, because that offense is offensive.  It resurfaced.  You can't call mommy to help you.  Right.  You're on your own.  You can't get a drink of water.  Hang on.  You guys are going to miss the completely not homoerotic WWE clip that's playing right now. 
[03:59:00]  Right.  So this is all we want you to do, David.  And Vince McMahon is a billionaire.  And this is family TV.  Oh, he just did a little peck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the ass.  We want open mouth, both lips, kissing Danny's ass.  That's all.  Danny's brown eye.  I'm going to talk to make sure everything's in his face.  Give him a fruit bowl.  Give him a fruit bowl.  Give him a fruit bowl.  No, no, no.  How much for a fruit bowl?  No, no, no, no, no.  How much for a fruit bowl, really? 
[03:59:30]  Come on.  Kiss his fruit bowl.  Everyone has a price.  No.  If you kissed his fruit bowl.  No, no, no, no.  We had to put lipstick on you so we know you really did it.  No, no.  It's not a dick and balls when it's a fruit bowl.  Yeah.  It can't call it dick and balls if it's called a fruit bowl.  Right?  No, no.  By 1130, this is going to be a rainbow party.  No, no, no, no.  All right.  Would you kiss Danny's ass for 40 hours?  We'll do it like this, the video, like a little peck. 
[04:00:00]  All right.  That's nice, too.  Danny, get up on the counter.  Ugh.  Jeez.  Danny's pretty sick.  He's presenting.  Danny's pretty sick.  Wait, get up on what?  On the, on the, uh...  Danny's presenting.  Danny, get up on the table.  On the console?  Yeah, please.  Where, where you want me?  On all floors.  He's pretty sick.  We're facing, what?  Facing, like...  This is pretty sick.  Facing David.  Whatever you need to do.  All right.  This is pretty sick and you're ready?  Shut up.  Let me figure this out.  We're just, we're redoing a stupid WWE video.  Fucking, there's kids in the audience for that crap. 
[04:00:30]  I'll do so that everybody can get a good look.  It's just a little kiss, that's all.  All right.  Danny's going to present his ass.  He's presenting.  He's...  What am I exactly doing?  Just giving me a little kiss?  Yeah.  Of course Sam goes right behind Danny as he presents his ass.  You're tonguing his asshole.  I'm producing.  Yeah.  What do you...  Sam, what do you think of Danny's ass?  I wouldn't put the dick in today.  I mean, you know, it's not bad.  You're going to have to go squeeze around that way, though.  Come on, David.  Come on, David.  It's just a little kiss, right?  We've all done it.  Yeah.  You're just joining a very special club. 
[04:01:00]  Not the middle, no.  I freeze.  Wait, David, what are you looking at?  Please.  I wish.  David, what are you looking at?  Did you rip it?  I'm looking at Danny's ass.  Explosive diarrhea.  David, what does it look like?  Looks like an ass.  Well, describe it.  Like, what kind of ass does Danny have?  It's a little bit big.  It's hair.  There's some hair.  Big?  Yeah.  It's a little bit big. 
[04:01:30]  It's hair.  There's some hair in the middle.  Yeah.  I'm taking it a good way.  All right.  What part are you going to kiss?  Just the butt cheek.  Well, Jimmy's going to help us through this.  Jimmy?  Of course, Jimmy is.  Well, just the butt cheek.  That's all I'm doing.  All right.  I love that bit.  Of course, Jimmy.  Hey, it's hair down the wall, but I love that bit.  Jimmy, where are you suggesting?  It's got to be a little...  I'm not doing it in the middle, anyways.  Right on the crack.  How about this?  Oh, no.  How about this?  If you don't want to do the middle, how about this?  You do the right cheek, and then you just drag your lip quickly to the left side. 
[04:02:00]  No, no, one kiss on the one cheek.  Nah, you've got to drag.  And give him a reach around.  David, if you drag your tongue over his asshole, I'll throw in another $20.  A rusty trombone.  Give my ass cheeks more.  No, no, no.  How about this?  I don't need the money, anyways.  I don't care about the money.  No, you do need the money.  Just a little kiss.  No, you do need the money.  Oh, I don't.  Let's start a little smooch.  But you've got to be on the right cheek.  Sam, show him how it's done, please.  Really?  I don't remember how it's done.  I don't know.  Just go guess. 
[04:02:30]  Just do a guess.  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm not doing it.  I'm just doing a kiss.  I'm a cheat.  That's all.  Sam will, like, kind of walk you through this.  I don't care.  Can I just lead him through it?  I don't care if he walks me through it.  I'm not going to do it.  Sam used to be an intern, so Sam, show him.  Show him what you had to do to be an intern on the show.  What if I just put my hand on the back of his head and guide him?  No.  I'm not doing that.  I'm just giving a kiss on the cheek, so.  Okay.  What's the difference between his cheek and if you kiss his ass crack? 
[04:03:00]  It's a little too much.  Not the asshole.  We're just talking the crack.  I know, but it's still too much.  So what's the difference?  It's uncomfortable for me.  I can't explain.  Why?  What's the difference?  It's wrong.  It's uncomfortable.  It's either an ass cheek.  Is it okay?  Yeah.  Do Sam need to give me an example or no?  Yeah.  I'm going to kiss the cheek. 
[04:03:30]  All right.  Are we ready?  Jimmy, you ready over there?  Yeah, we're ready to go.  Bye.  Am I getting an example?  Follow me, Dave.  Go to this cheek like I go to this cheek.  It's just a little kiss.  I'm not doing a double.  Wait.  You're doing a double?  Yeah.  I'm just going to show him.  Why don't you show him ahead of time?  You show him, Sam.  You show him.  You show him first.  Watch.  David, if Sam knows it.  You've got to come in close.  You've got to come in close, David.  I'm watching.  You have to come close, David.  I'm not coming close.  I'm watching for me.  David.  You're going to push my head.  And we all know Sam has a girlfriend that's going to be leaving him soon.  But he does have a girlfriend.  So Sam, why don't you show David how it's done? 
[04:04:00]  I'm not putting my head.  You're going to drag my head and do it.  I'm not doing that.  No.  David, just get to the cheek.  I'm waiting for you to show me how to do it.  I don't feel any mouth on my ass.  I'm waiting for Sam to give me an example.  I'm waiting for Sam to give me the example of how to do it.  I don't know how.  Well, I think you should still kiss his ass, David.  I think you know how to kiss his ass.  I think David raises an excellent point.  After Sam shows him, he'll do it.  David, will you do it if I do it? 
[04:04:30]  Um, I will kiss, I will give a kiss on one of the butt cheeks.  I will not do it, I'm not going to do it the way, probably the way you are going to do it.  What's that supposed to mean, you son of a bitch?  I don't know how you're going to show me, but.  Oh, Sam, you're going to take that?  David, I'm trying to lead you to something here.  Will you do it if I do it?  I don't know, it depends.  I don't know exactly what you're going to do.  I'm just going to give a kiss on the cheek, that's it.  I give a kiss on the cheek, you give a kiss on the cheek.  Yes.  All right, let's.  You show it, you first.  Enjoy it, Danny.  I'm going to, immensely.  Why don't you perform a... 
[04:05:00]  That was a kiss on my ass.  Sam.  There you go, I did it.  Sam just kissed me.  Sam's gay.  That's okay, you're so gay.  It's all right.  David, your turn.  That's all I'm going to do, too.  I don't need that money.  That's all I'm going to do.  By the way, take back the money.  Oopsie.  As far as taking a picture of my BlackBerry.  Hold on a minute.  I'm going to send this off to somebody.  Not yet.  Am I going to get in trouble with SidePiece?  No, no.  Maybe.  All right, David, you ready for your $40?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[04:05:30]  You saw Sam do it.  I don't need any money.  You know, I'm just happy that my ass is finally getting the attention it deserves.  There's cameras on it.  This is great.  It's like your ass is out of press conference.  There's so many cameras in here.  I'm a star.  Go ahead, David.  It's your turn.  Okay, ready?  Sam, you decide if he did a good enough job for the $40 or you're doing this for free.  I'm telling you right now.  Okay, fine.  Where's my money?  Come on, get with us, Sean White.  Sean White?  Okay, here I go. 
[04:06:00]  Oh!  David!  Did you see how deep he went in?  Wow.  I got to say, Sam's kiss was just a nice little peck.  Dave's a little wetter than I would have liked to have been.  And Sam what?  Sam shoved his face right into the face.  Sam grabbed David's head and shoved his face right into Danny's asshole.  I was expecting that. 
[04:06:30]  Oh, God.  Wow, that's a perfect picture.  Because I'm an ass man.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  I'm an ass man.  Dave's an ass man.  I think Dave should get 20 for that.  Yeah, we'll give you 20.  I'm an ass man.  Why are we 20?  You didn't really, uh...  You really didn't show gumption.  Yeah, it's too...  You didn't do it right.  Jimmy takes his back.  You didn't impress him.  Don't crumple it up. 
[04:07:00]  Pick it up.  No, we could do is we could put the other $20 in Danny's asshole and just pull it out  with your teeth.  No, no, no, no.  I'll put it...  You know what I'll do?  I'll put it, like, underneath my ball sack so my sack is holding the bill and he has to  get it any way that he deems necessary.  Where are you going, David?  David, where are you going?  What's wrong?  You all right, David?  I'm all right.  Let's make sure David's okay.  Did you break your nose?  No, I didn't break my nose at all, no.  What happened? 
[04:07:30]  Tell everybody what happened.  No, it's all good.  My face went in Danny's ass and my glasses fell off.  No, the glasses didn't fall off.  Oh, good.  Protective lenses.  It was kind of doing a bit there, David.  That's okay.  Would you kind of kiss mine?  I will not kiss you.  No.  No one will be near it.  I'm done with that.  There's an extra 20 in it for you.  Oh, I know.  Sam.  How about this?  Bring him back in here.  How about this?  David, get back in here. 
[04:08:00]  How about this?  You don't have to kiss my butt.  No one will be near you.  You just blow air on it.  Oh, that's a good idea.  I won't touch you, dude.  I promise you.  I won't touch you.  For the people playing at home, Jimmy has.  No, no.  David, I'm not going to touch you.  I don't lie to you.  I'm not going to touch you.  Oh, yeah.  I will not touch you.  David, how about if no one's in the room?  No one will be near you.  Sandy, move out of the area.  For $20, what I have to do is blow on Jimmy's ass?  Are you kidding me?  No, I will not do that.  I promise you.  Sam will not be near you.  You have my word. 
[04:08:30]  What's the point of it?  Because I don't think it's funny to blow on somebody's ass.  It's creepy.  Yeah, because then Jimmy will do what?  Jimmy will do some kind of tee-hee.  It'll be fun radio, and then we go home.  David, if I will.  We don't go home, but we should do this.  Nobody will touch you.  I promise you.  Yeah.  I won't even be around.  Nobody will be around you.  How close, Jimmy?  Like a foot away?  No, I'd say within a couple inches.  No one will touch you.  Jimmy is a man of his word, David.  You can trust him until he proves you wrong.  I promise you, none of them will be around.  Dave, we'll all stand behind Opie, so you can visually see all of us at all times. 
[04:09:00]  Nobody will come near you.  What do I got to do?  You put a couple of inches in my ass, and you blow air on my ass cheeks.  But I won't touch you.  Someone's going to push my head.  No one's going to push you.  Close the door so, look, no one can run in.  Yeah, no one can come in, and we'll all stand behind Opie.  You can even hold your own mic, David.  Now, I've given the mic.  Sam, go over there.  Everyone behind over here.  Now, you can see everybody.  David, look, is there anyone else in the room? 
[04:09:30]  Who's going to push your head?  Who's going to push your head?  No one.  Someone's going to run over.  You'll see it.  You'll see it, and you'll run away.  No one.  I promise you.  Believe it.  We tell them no one's going to fucking run over and touch you.  Right.  Do me promises.  If you want us getting you more Yankee Crankies, you've got to do this for a whole show.  I actually don't want you to touch my ass.  Yeah.  What am I doing, then?  Putting your face by the cheek and blowing.  Blowing or just blowing?  Blowing air.  But get on your knees.  I'm not going to touch you.  No one's going to touch you.  No one's going to touch you.  No one's going to touch you. 
[04:10:00]  Travis is over here.  What do you want, Travis, so you're not nervous?  I saw someone whisper.  Mars was just whispering at how funny this is.  No one will move.  Dave, look around the room.  What could possibly go wrong?  We've got hip-hop Ron on the camera.  The rest of the guys are way behind the camera.  Come on, David.  What's the point of this?  You put a right button.  No one's going to touch you.  Because Jimmy will make a funny noise.  Hold on.  You're going to have a fart in my face or something.  No, I'm not.  That's stupid.  See?  See?  See?  I told you. 
[04:10:30]  See?  See?  I told you.  I didn't even blow you.  I didn't even blow you yet.  He's an ass man.  See?  I told you.  I knew he was going to do that.  He's an ass man.  I wasn't going to touch you, though.  No, you weren't.  I told you nobody would touch you.  That was a damn good one, Jimmy.  He's still doing that.  Oh.  Steven Escher made sure who knew David would be starring in the baby turd video. 
[04:11:00]  There you go.  You got $40.  Oh, thank you.  Well, now I got $60 because you gave me $20.  Yeah.  I gave me $20.  Oh, then I could have my $20 back then.  Now ask Jewish Kobe how your ass tastes.  Oh.  Can I have my $20 back?  Because Jimmy gave you $40.  It's only fair.  Fair is fair.  You know.  If Jimmy's giving you the $40.  How easy is this kid?  No.  He just gave...  Will you take my $20?  That was a joke.  No, I'll give you $20 if you kiss my $20 again. 
[04:11:30]  No.  All right, here.  Here's my $20.  I don't want people to think I'm cheap.  There you go.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Actually, I think Dave should probably apologize for making the show go so late.  David, I agree.  I had a doctor's appointment at 11.15.  We're crazy behind on breaks.  So if you don't mind, could you please apologize to myself especially and the show in general?  We really wanted to get out of here right at 11.  And to me for those chapped lips. 
[04:12:00]  Right.  Yeah, and to me for fucking cutting.  And apologize.  Say, look, I apologize that I kissed Daddy's ass.  Why should I apologize?  And was going to blow on Jimmy's ass until he farted.  I didn't mean to fart at all.  And because of that, you guys are really late and you're late for your doctor's appointment.  I think that's a good one, Danny.  If you will.  I apologize.  I'm sorry for making the show go late today.  Why did the show go late?  The show go late today because I didn't want to kiss Danny's ass for a while or blow on Jimmy's ass. 
[04:12:30]  But you did.  But I did, yes.  And why did you do that?  Who had a nice rash?  For the show.  I did it for the show because you guys wanted me to do it.  So I did it.  Who had a nice rash, me or Danny?  They were both nice.  You have to decide.  Yeah, look, we all like different kinds of ice cream.  It's like Highlander.  There can only be one.  You do pick one that you like a little better than the rest of the flavors.  If I had to pick one, I would pick Jimmy's.  Why?  I don't like the heroin on Danny was too much for me.  It's not that bad. 
[04:13:00]  He makes his hair over there.  So Jimmy's was clean.  Sasquatch ass.  It's not bad at all.  It's safe to say you're not a fan of hairy man ass, but if it's a smooth man's ass, you're okay with it.  I guess so.  You could say that.  You could say that.  All right.  It really wasn't that bad, Danny.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tippi likes mine the best.  Good luck explaining all this to you.  You're a chick.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Godspeed with that.  We're good at faking stuff for the radio, huh, guys?  What?  It's all fake. 
[04:13:30]  I like three guys.  Ooh.  All right.  Which three guys?  All right.  What's wrong?  Why are you making a weird face, Dave?  I'm making weird faces.  I don't know.  He's still trying to get that pube out.  I don't think it went down.  You can't get that pube out.  Hey, Dave, that's not a pube.  That's one of my ass hairs.  That's his asshole hair.  Whatever it is, it didn't go down.  I don't think it's having trouble going down, whatever it is.  You want to drink some water?  It's all right. 
[04:14:00]  Why?  You don't trust us with some water?  It's all right.  It's so bad.  It's all right.  He can wash it down, but he has to do a butt shot out of my crack.  It's the cascade over my...  All right.  It'll be a fruit bowl.  The fruit bowl.  That would be great.  If we could have got the fruit bowl.  Oh, the fruit bowl.  Oh, my God.  Something's got to be done with the fruit bowl at some point.  How much...  I'll go to the goddamn ATM. 
[04:14:30]  How much would it take for you to...  What are we doing, placing or kissing the fruit bowl?  Oh, no, no, no.  Dave, will you just listen?  I'm not doing that.  There's nothing wrong with listening.  I'm listening, but I'm not doing it.  And what is the fruit bowl?  Well, the fruit bowl is...  Well, you know what the tuck looks like from the front?  That's what it looks like the tuck from the back.  Right.  Is a fruit bowl.  Because it looks like a banana and a couple of, like, peaches or plums or whatever is back there. 
[04:15:00]  And since it's snuggled between your thighs and butt cheeks like a bowl, it is called the fruit bowl.  How much to kiss the fruit bowl, David?  I don't know.  Let's get right down to...  You're a poor kid.  You got turned on to the Yankee Cranky Shop.  I know you want to go back there.  I got a solid hundred.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm not going to do it.  I don't want to kiss the fruit bowl.  That's too much.  I don't want to.  I would imagine my pal Ant's got a hundred, too. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah.  I don't want to.  For the fruit bowl.  That's $200 cash.  For the fruit bowl.  I know what it is, but I don't want to.  All right.  I don't think he's going to do the fruit bowl.  No.  I'm not engaging in basically prostitution.  I'm not pimping out.  That would be a great headline for a fucking paper.  Oh, and I float off the air for a male prostitution.  To the record.  I'm not paying the intern to kiss Danny's fucking balls and cock. 
[04:16:00]  Sorry.  I'm a bit killer.  I'm out.  You can kiss the butt sheets, but I'm not paying to have Danny tuck his fucking cock and  balls back by his asshole and give him kiss.  You just don't know how to have a good time.  Yeah.  What's the problem, Jimmy?  Jimmy puts things into perspective you can really understand.  What's wrong with the fruit bowl?  I don't know.  Just a tough one to explain to corporate if we get any shit.  You know, the stock's not exactly going through the roof.  They don't want any fucking headaches.  Trying to fix debt and get all that shit paid off. 
[04:16:30]  And we got a fruit bowl kissing going on.  They called it fruit bowl.  Wait.  Can you imagine what the reports would be on?  Yeah.  Imagine.  I'm trying to describe.  An indescribable act on the shock jock radio show of Opie and Anthony once again in trouble.  How many meetings have we done like that?  What were you thinking when you had the dude kiss the fruit bowl?  It's known as a fruit bowl.  And they're in turn with a known learning disability. 
[04:17:00]  I didn't want to do it.  I told them all.  They said they would give me $20.  Oh, boy.  We here in the newsroom cannot even describe what this fruit bowl is.  But they do the whole report with an actual fruit bowl.  But suffice to say, it is disgusting and despicable.  It just gave me an idea for a listener submission contest.  Yeah.  Listeners have to produce their own news reports.  Oh, their own news reports.  Of the show being fired for one of these ridiculous things. 
[04:17:30]  For him having to kiss the fruit bowl.  Or anything else that's happened in the past.  We should have a fruit bowl contest where you actually do the fruit bowl, but then someone  paint it so it looks like real fun.  You can glue little stems on your balls.  By the way, the timing might be off now, but Pat from Wunaki texted me.  He's calling this David's Choice.  David, did you want to kiss the fruit bowl?  No.  You definitely didn't.  Were the guys pressuring you to kiss the fruit bowl? 
[04:18:00]  Yes.  That's how that would look on the news.  Fucking terrible.  That would look terrible.  I'm a little confused, though.  I'm not with you on this.  What's wrong with the fruit bowl?  In theory, it's funny.  Okay.  But the idea that David's an intern, and we're saying, look, we'd like you to put your mouth  by Danny's cock and balls, and then on it, we'll give you...  Here's the amount of money we'll pay you to do that.  There's no way that's allowable.  I'm not a lawyer.  We can't explain that one away?  It's an impossible one.  Kissing the butt cheek is explainable.  He was paid money to put his mouth on another employee's genitalia. 
[04:18:30]  Yeah.  Fruit bowl.  In what was known as a fruit bowl.  Yes.  A radio stunt gone bad.  Yes.  Tom Brokaw would have to come out of retirement for this.  No one is a fruit bowl.  A young, innocent man was forced to kiss another man's genitals.  Travis was saying, he's wondering if the news has fruit bowl B-roll. 
[04:19:00]  They would just show a real fruit bowl, a banana, and a couple of fucking plums.  Well, they'd show stock footage of people in clothes bending over to pick things up.  What part would be the worst about that?  Just the fact that...  The mouth on the fucking genitals, I think, would probably sum it up as worst.  The mouth on genitals of an intern.  Oh.  You're getting the music. 
[04:19:30]  Cool.  We gotta get out of here.  Yeah, no fruit bowl today.  Man.  We got so gay today.  We sure did, man.  We certainly did.  Let's not forget that we did the Kiss Lily bit today, though.  That was some fine lesbianism.  We did about 15 seconds of lesbianism and about two hours of a gay.  We'll put the lesbianism on YouTube, though.  We will, huh?  Yeah.  Will that be a biggie for the WWE folks?  I bet it will. 
[04:20:00]  Yeah.  For making out with a female intern?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And don't forget about Sam's big secret.  Sam's big secret.  I'm gonna put the dick in today.  Or that one.  Whatever.  That doesn't even make any sense.  Way to keep the secret.  There's no secret.  I like three guys.  That's not...  No, that's not...  What three guys do you like?  Way to keep your secret, Sam.  We were hoping for some good TSL.  Hey, who...  I have a T-Z for the rest of the year.  Maybe, you know, you could do your whole secret thing  when we get back from vacation. 
[04:20:30]  It's not a secret.  Here's a good...  I have a good...  I have a good trivia question.  Yeah.  39 years ago today,  who married Miss Vicky on The Tonight Show?  Jesus Christ.  Really fast?  Because it's just too good of a line.  I don't even want to steal it.  What kind of Tim married?  Right.  Alex or Long Island?  We forgot about this angle.  Yes, go ahead.  This fruit bowl has advertised  the sponsors of the popular shock jock radio 
[04:21:00]  going bananas.  They would have to work their...  Going bananas.  They would have to work their fruit shit into the store.  Did an Opie and Anthony intern  actually have the grapes to go along with this?  Yes.  And they'd probably show two apples  with a banana between it.  That would be a good idea.  We can't tell you,  but we'll try to give you an example  of this fruit bowl.  And then you see Brian Williams  demonstrating it,  like actually pulling his jeans down  and tucking his chicken bowl. 
[04:21:30]  That's just three guys. </pre>
