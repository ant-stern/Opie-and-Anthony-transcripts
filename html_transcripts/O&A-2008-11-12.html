<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the perceived high gay population in San Francisco, fueled by Opie's comment and countered by Jim Norton's experiences. Listener statistics confirming San Francisco's high LGBTQ+ population fueled further banter.  The conversation then shifted to the legalization of gay marriage in Connecticut, punctuated by a montage of same-sex couples kissing, which led to Jim Norton recounting a humorous anecdote about watching gay pornography with a friend.

Next, the show tackled the suspension of a teacher's aide for making offensive jokes about President-elect Barack Obama, the flag, and the national anthem.  This segued into a discussion about unreliable substitute teachers.  The hosts then discussed a new cologne by Tony Sirico ("Paulie Walnuts") from *The Sopranos*, leading to a debate about stereotypical media portrayals of Italians and other ethnic groups.  The show then featured callers recounting instances of being deliberately bumped into by people wearing large Obama buttons, sparking a debate about post-election social interactions and the role of race and politics in shaping these encounters.  Many callers shared their diverse perspectives and experiences, with some attributing the incidents to increased racial tension and others to general rudeness.

The discussion continued into a segment focusing on Anthony's personal experience being bumped into by a woman wearing an Obama button, which he perceived as aggressive. This prompted a broader conversation on race relations post-Obama election, with callers offering varied perspectives on the impact of his presidency and the complexities of interracial interactions.  This segment also included Anthony's complaints about the incident, commentary on Mayor Bloomberg's policies, and a significant portion dedicated to celebrity gossip, including negative commentary about Beyonc√© and Madonna's parenting rules (especially her strict macrobiotic diet), punctuated by the hosts' sarcastic and often offensive remarks. Jimmy Norton also mentioned his upcoming book signing.

The show then featured a caller, Angela, vehemently complaining about an Ashley Madison commercial airing during drive time, expressing concern about children's exposure. The hosts aggressively challenged her viewpoint, engaging in a hostile and vulgar exchange, resorting to insults and sexually suggestive comments.  The ensuing debate covered infidelity, advertising, and freedom of speech, with other callers joining the fray, some supporting Angela and others siding with the hosts.  The segment concluded with the hosts discussing their dislike of iPhones and AT&T, along with the changes to the SiriusXM channel lineup, including the removal of channels like "Audio Visions" and "Fine Tuning," which prompted further listener calls and debate.

A subsequent segment heavily featured listener reactions to the SiriusXM merger and channel changes, with numerous calls expressing anger and frustration over the loss of certain music channels and the addition of others. Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy discussed the changes, shared anecdotes, and used vulgar language.  A notable portion included a phone call and in-studio appearance by veteran radio personality Pat St. John, who discussed his new role in SiriusXM, sharing stories from his career, including interviews with famous musicians.  The conversation frequently veered into crude territory.  The show also featured discussion of the "Raw Dog" show and its host Jim Brewer, and a humorous farewell message from a departing XM programmer, Bill Hutton.  The segment concluded with complaints about the hosts' channel categorization on SiriusXM and more sexually explicit jokes and listener calls.

The final segment focused on Jimmy's wedding anxieties, specifically the complications and unexpected black-tie dress code, including a humorous anecdote about a tux fitting. This was followed by a lengthy, vulgar, and graphically detailed discussion about a news story concerning a Swedish bestiality ring,  including descriptions of various animals' genitalia and imagined sexual encounters.  The hosts and callers shared numerous jokes and sexually explicit comments, with a caller even recounting a humorous anecdote about a horse urinating.  The conversation also touched upon the legal implications of animal-human interactions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi. Good morning, Anthony.  And what a fine morning it is, Mr. Opie.  It sure is, Mr. Kumya.  Mr. Kumya.  877-212-ON-A.  I'm ready to broadcast. I got my pumpsy green card right in front of me.  Like a good luck charm or something?  Yeah, it just sits here.  Or something.  Or something like that.  Good morning, Jim Norton.  Taking off his coat as we start the show. 
[00:00:30]  There's Jimmy with his gay hoodie.  San Francisco on the front.  Yeah, that's what I say.  It's just everyone I heard.  I've never been to old San Fran, as they call it.  Frisco, as they call it.  The Barbary Coast.  I've never been there.  But every time I see the word, I just think gay.  I know, it's really too bad because I've been there, I think, twice. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, have you?  It's probably the best city in America.  No way.  I swear to God, it's an amazing, an amazing city.  You go there, I'll go to Miami.  I understand that, Ant.  I go to Miami Beach.  But see...  That's the best city in America.  Miami's not bad for the people watching, but as a city, it blows.  Does it?  It absolutely blows.  Warm, there's just a hotness after hotness walking by.  I think my favorite city still is Boston.  Yeah.  Then San Francisco.  And then probably Philly, because I've been spending a lot of time in Philly the last few 
[00:01:30]  years.  But San Francisco, you bring up a great point.  It really is a shame because the average person thinks gay.  You don't see the gay when you go to San Francisco unless you search it out, I guess.  Really?  I swear to God, I didn't see it everywhere.  Maybe your gaydar went down.  You're in the wrong area, my friend.  Did you see the gay when you go to San Francisco?  No.  I mean, living in New York, it's hard to say because you see guys holding hands are women, 
[00:02:00]  but you see that here, too.  It's not...  I don't feel it any differently there.  No.  I really don't.  Yeah.  I'm with Jimmy.  But it's so gay.  Like, everything gay is in San Francisco.  But I don't think it's like...  I don't think it's even...  Mayor's gay?  I would imagine there's got to be a gay area or something because it's not spread out  throughout the city.  It must be concentrated in an area.  The gay area ends in Oakland.  The bridge, exactly. 
[00:02:30]  Because I was kind of worried the first time I went there.  Like, what am I...  You know, and I didn't see the gay.  Yeah.  I saw beautiful women.  I saw the greatest restaurants, wine bars.  Just looking out your hotel room at the scenery is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you're up on a...  Slender man asses.  Because you're up on a hill and you got the Golden Gate Bridge and the water and...  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can understand the scenery.  But then, you know, the people walking around, you don't see any more gay people in San Francisco 
[00:03:00]  than you do here in New York.  It's hard to say.  I swear.  I...  My ex's family's from there, so last time I went out...  What's his name?  What's it?  Francois.  Francois.  Yes.  He's got a karate expert's body, which is odd.  Right.  But her whole family's from around there, so it's like when I went out there, I spent  a lot of time with her family just doing, like, local things, going out to local restaurants  and...  Yeah.  No different...  I mean, you see gay people.  Maybe there's a little more, but it's not like you think you're going to go to San Francisco  and, you know, the airport, they're just going to be rolling around like 
[00:03:30]  tires on each other.  It just doesn't happen.  That's just what I picture.  No.  I think it's going to be very gay.  I know there's beautiful women.  Maybe the women are...  Oh, with Adam's...  Maybe.  I was very surprised at how good-looking the women were.  Yeah?  Yeah, in general.  Is there, like, a good ratio for straight guys?  Or, again, not too many gay guys?  I can't...  I can't...  I can't listen to you guys tell me that San Francisco isn't chock-full of gay guys.  I understand. 
[00:04:00]  I...  You know...  They get a bad rap.  He's got a stat.  Yes.  I have a government statistic from the last census says that 15.4% of the population of  San Francisco identifies itself as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, the highest in the nation, behind  Seattle, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Boston, Oakland, Sacramento, Portland, Denver, and Long Beach.  Okay, so that would be, like, that's more than black people are nationally.  Well, the national average...  It's 17, isn't it? 
[00:04:30]  What's the national average of gays?  Are we up to about 10%?  Close...  They say close to 10, but that's...  So that's 50% over the national average.  Wow.  See, that's a lot of gay people in Frisco.  I don't know.  Check it out for yourself.  Maybe they just aren't as flamboyant and you didn't notice them.  I don't know.  It was...  I mean, as far as tour stuff, it was amazing.  Yeah.  Doing the Alcatraz thing and checking out the...  What are they?  The seals or the walruses on the piers?  Well, I'm sure that's wonderful, but...  But you're scared of the gay. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, I'm not scared of the gay.  They might, you know, attack you.  Put up your dukes.  I say.  Old school?  Yeah, old school.  I don't know.  Where were we?  Oh, uh...  I just was distracted by Jimmy's wonderful little hoodie.  Yeah, my San Francisco...  He looks adorable in it.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I like to eat rice-a-roni in this.  It's the San Francisco treat.  It's true.  Although I think it's the second San Francisco treat.  The first is a giant...  So if there's so many... 
[00:05:30]  If there's so many gays in that area, how do they, like, vote no for gay marriage?  Well, that was the whole state.  The state.  The whole state.  All right.  Okay.  You got...  Again, as Bill Burr said, you can't forget about, like, Barstow and places like that.  And apparently the black community and the Latino communities voted 70% to 80% against  Proposition 8.  Said hell no.  Yeah.  They're very religious people.  Yes.  You know?  A lot of Catholics and whatnot.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  They're very anti-gay overall black.  Yes.  Yes.  Most white, too.  Although on the DL, you know, they'll do some things.  The blacks?  You hear about the black community having things, you know, on the DL.  Well...  Some covert gay.  Well, they got the gay marriage happening in Connecticut starting today.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  Today's the day.  Not recognized anywhere else, but have fun in your state.  One state.  Good old Connecticut said, ah, what the hell? 
[00:06:30]  Let's give this a shot.  I know.  I heard that on the news this morning.  I heard an interview with a couple of just real lesbians that are thrilled to death that  they're going to be able to get married.  And they said they have a civil union, but it's not the same.  It doesn't have the same ceremonial thing and symbolic gesture of marriage.  Mm-hmm.  Who cares?  All right.  Who cares either way?  Just let people do what they want.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Married.  I only want to hug this man and make love to him forever. 
[00:07:00]  Go ahead.  Good.  Then do it.  More power to you.  You don't want to give him partner benefits?  All right, fine.  Don't.  Then don't have him pay the same taxes.  Don't charge...  Hey, hey, now.  Don't charge gays the same for, you know, at the end of the year for the IRS.  You know what I mean?  If you don't want to give the same, whatever, lifestyle for everybody else, then don't charge  them the same.  It's stupid.  Yeah, they pay...  Good idea.  They pay into the system, right?  Of course.  And marriage isn't that sacred anymore. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, it stinks.  We have to show some work out nicely.  I'm not stupid as I give it a shot that 50 to 60% of these marriages, you know...  You dive right in.  Yeah, why not?  But, you know, 50 or 60% don't survive.  It's not sacred anymore.  Look at that.  Oh!  Oh, I bet daddy's happy about that one.  Oh!  Oh, look.  A montage of guys kissing each other.  It's just a montage.  Wow.  Of gayness.  Oh, my God.  That montage is worse than the belly montage they do. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  For the fat stories.  The gay marriage montage, yeah.  Wow, you're going to see that on TV all day.  A lot of making out.  Boy, I bet some people get so mad at that.  You know, I'm...  In my home, my children were watching.  I'm trying to have more of an open mind as I get older.  It's not your mind.  You've got to open up.  The man-on-man kiss is still a rough one to take in.  I don't know why that is.  It's just a rough one, man.  It really is tough to watch.  You said the other day that you and the guy spent like an afternoon or an hour or whatever. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, it was an entire afternoon.  Yeah.  No, it was after the show one day, a few months back, just watching hardcore gay porno  on the computer.  Right.  And we were laughing our asses off.  It was funny.  It's one of those things where it's like two men look ridiculous.  Usually a guy and a girl having sex just look silly.  Some of the moves they do.  But two guys just look silly.  I don't need an example of gay sex. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you.  Whatever we talk about, Danny tries to pop something up on the screen for us real fast.  Oh, we need the monitor up here.  Do we?  In front.  Yeah, but then two guys going out.  It just looks silly.  So you guys, you better explain yourself.  You did it as a goof.  You guys were laughing.  No explaining.  It was wonderful.  It was great to watch.  No, and you're sitting around and you're going through these various tube sites.  Yeah.  Whatever, something tube. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And you go from one sexual deviant to the next.  Just occasionally something's going to pop up and we were just laughing and commenting  on it.  But then the kiss is just, it's ten times harder to watch as a straight guy, two guys  making out, than it is to just watch hardcore, horrific gay sex.  Yeah.  I guess it's that sensitivity.  I don't know what it is.  And that they mean so much to each other.  I still have a tough time with that one. 
[00:10:00]  Than just, yeah.  Yeah, do it.  It's just an odd thing.  So you guys, like, all right.  Can you turn it off?  That's wonderful.  Is that Mike Tyson?  I didn't even know.  Wow.  I didn't even know what he was doing.  I turned and there's a black face.  Yeah.  And there's white skin.  Yeah.  Oh, he's black skin.  Lighter skinned black gentleman.  Thanks.  What a way to start the morning.  Thanks, Danny.  Very diverse pornography.  Jesus.  That's a little rough.  I'll say one thing for the one guy. 
[00:10:30]  He certainly, when he commits.  Yes.  When he commits to swallowing something, he doesn't play games.  Oh, God.  All right.  We're going to move on.  Are we?  Sure.  Well.  Ride him cowboy.  It's like Kenny from Oz.  The skinnier one, really, oddly enough, seems to be teaching the larger one a lesson.  A little bit of a lesson there.  Oh, my God.  Is he teaching him something?  Wow.  I was reading reviews on Amazon for I Hate Your Guts. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And it's not a Horace plug.  One of them was some guy talking about how he was reading the book.  Well, actually, it had fallen out of the knapsack of an African-American gentleman.  And then as he was perusing with his toe, as he was prepping the bull,  I was howling reading this review.  Oh, really?  He goes through a whole scenario?  Oh.  Nice.  Fans are goddamn funny, man.  They're the greatest.  All right.  We're going to change the subject quickly here.  Before more people wake up and hear this crap. 
[00:11:30]  Rick in Rockland, what's going on?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Rick.  How are you today?  Oh, I'm just ducky.  Thanks for asking.  Good.  Did you guys know that on November 12, 1955, Marty McFly played Johnny B. Good with Marvin  Berry and the Starlighters at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance?  Well, sir, this is probably the most important day in Back to the Future history.  Why would it be that?  Well, as we have it, at 6 a.m., 6 a.m., mere few minutes ago, Doc and Marty, that's Marty 
[00:12:00]  B. That's the second Marty that came back, arrive in 1955 from the alternate 1985.  The fun one with, you know, Biff in the casino.  In 2015, Biff arrives with the sports almanac and gives it to younger Biff, creating the  alternate timeline.  Marty, that's Marty A. from The Real 1985, takes Lorraine to the dance. 
[00:12:30]  Biff interferes and George punches Biff after trying to rape Lorraine in the car.  And, of course, they fall in love.  Marty B. also keeps Biff's gang from jumping Marty A. without Marty A. even noticing.  As he was playing Johnny B. Good, Biff's gang was there trying to get him because it  was the alternate universe kind of a thing going on.  Marty B. shut up.  Marty B. gets the almanac from Biff and burns it, erasing the alternate future and returning 
[00:13:00]  the timeline to normal.  The 1985 Doc in the DeLorean gets struck by lightning and sent back to 1885.  A car, of course, approaches from Western Union.  A man gives Marty a letter from the Doc in 1885.  Marty hurries back downtown to see the 1955 Doc.  And, of course, tonight at 10.04 p.m., lightning strikes the clock tower, sending Marty back  to the real 85, 1985.  But Marty B., the second Marty, scares the 1955 Doc by returning seconds after he sends Marty 
[00:13:30]  A. back to the future.  Very, very important day for Back to the Future.  November 12th, 1955.  Anthony.  We celebrate today.  Yes, sir.  I still think you should buy a DeLorean.  If you need garage space, tell Keith and his wife to start parking in the driveway.  It's not the driveway.  It's my garage.  Well, you need a DeLorean, dude.  Yeah, you really do.  Which now sucks because I have all of my basement storage stuff in my garage. 
[00:14:00]  So now my Escalade has to stay outside.  Boy, was it chilly getting in there this morning.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  They're sheet rocking down there today.  They're sheet rocking in my basement.  From my, as Sal calls it, theater.  Row, it's a theater.  Is it getting close to done?  Well, like I said, they're sheet rocking.  So everything's in the walls.  Everything's ready to go. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This thing is just what a project this has become.  They have to put pumps in my floor for a bathroom down there and all kinds of goodies.  I went down there the other day to, yeah, that's pretty much what it's going to look like right there.  Well, it's radio, though.  Well, I'm showing you.  Oh.  So you go, oh, okay.  And boy, to watch the Back to the Future trilogy on that is just going to be.  It's going to be great.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Yeah, that's just amazing. 
[00:15:00]  No, that's not mine.  But that's exactly what it's going to look like.  Exactly.  Except I'll have more theater-like seats.  Wow.  That's awesome.  Let's get some more of these hot videos up while we're on break.  No, that's all right.  A couple of men watching.  Men.  Then why don't we, as he puts the video back up.  All right.  We're going to go to the F.U. line.  We're going to regroup.  We're going to go to the phones next.  877-212-ON-A.  First this.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s. 
[00:15:30]  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I want to start my day off by saying,  F*** you to that s*** Reverend Al Sharpton for giving that guy s***  for writing that article in the Post about Plexigal Burris.  I hope Jim Norton s***s your wife, gives her the crap,  and you die from it, you fat, miserable bastard.  Next message.  I think it's a big F.U.  to whoever came up with the idea of beeping seatbelt alarms.  I'm driving around in my car, and I'm doing putting around at five miles an hour, 
[00:16:00]  and the thing's beeping in my face.  I don't want to wear my seatbelt!  Next message.  I thought I'd send a big F.U. out to the ladies of s*** at the borders in the mall,  who said, oh yeah, we have Jim Norton's book,  but it's in a box, and we're not sure what box it's in.  You know, why would you take your f***ing fat lazy ass back there  and do your job and head the f***ing book out when it goes on for sale?  Next message.  I'm calling to say F.U. to my ex-husband.  And anyway, I don't care that he's been a dirty rat,  because I've been f***ing the neighbor next door, 
[00:16:30]  and he's better than you.  So F.U., Mr. W. F.U.  Next message.  Hey, this is Bobby Big, Pipes from, uh, from around.  They're just trying to f*** you out to the Hicks that were on the Long Island Railroad,  coming home from the Jim Norton signing,  and this family of white trash couldn't keep their albino children under control  when these little f***ers were running around the train with f***ing monkeys.  So f*** them and f*** their entire family.  Next message.  Hey, this F.U. goes out to Joe Buck and the Fox Network.  Joe, you take it up, the f***. 
[00:17:00]  Next message.  This is Pat calling from Northport.  I just like to send a big f*** you to the Philadelphia Phillies and all their fans.  F*** you. Your city still sucks.  Next message.  I would like to give a big f*** you to Intern David.  You are a f*** idiot.  You wouldn't know the Jewish religion if it smacked you across your f***ing Yiddish face.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye. 
[00:17:30]  Opie and Anthony starring Jim Norton.  Let's get into some stuff.  We got a teacher aide suspended for mocking Obama.  What?  That's right.  Racism alive and well in America.  We'll talk about the Italian thing in a second too.  Yeah.  It all pretty much goes together.  Right?  Right?  Listen to this story.  Local teacher's aide facing disciplinary action after he allegedly made some disparaging remarks about President-elect Barack Obama. 
[00:18:00]  Those comments were overheard by one of his students whose mother is speaking out tonight.  It's not something you want or expect your children to hear, especially when they're in school.  The country witnessed history in the making last week after the polls closed, the votes were counted, and Senator Barack Obama was elected president.  But not everyone was thrilled about the election results.  A teacher's aide who works here at the A.W. Beatty Career Center on Babcock Boulevard made some comments to a North Hills student that were offensive. 
[00:18:30]  The girl went home and told her parents.  One of the teacher's aides that does teach one of the classes here, he's an assistant, said that Obama was going to be shot and killed and that our flag is going to be changed to the KFC flag and that the new national anthem will be moving on up and that my daughter's beliefs were wrong and her children's lives were going to be ruined because Obama was elected.  Where did she go to the school?  The Apollo?  I know.  What is awesome? 
[00:19:00]  Such hacky jokes, too.  Oh, my God.  You know, we just heard this and that.  Moving on up.  Moving on up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Right.  These teacher aides.  You always knew the teacher aides and the substitute teachers.  They were like, eh.  Yeah.  Nowhere's near a real teacher.  They were supposed to be the cool ones.  They kind of were.  All they had to do was start the film projector.  That's it.  Substitutes were useless. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think I ever got.  Well, I never did work when the regular teacher was in there, but.  That was a good day, though.  You come to school.  Maybe there's an exam planned.  Next thing you know, you see some stranger in the front of the classroom.  And you see.  What?  And you see the film projector.  You're like, oh, thank God.  You know your teacher's home with a raging hangover.  It was all about the hangover, right?  Yeah, of course.  They didn't just also.  Stop drinking.  Get the.  Well, they have one day, like, cold. 
[00:20:00]  What'd you have?  Right.  For one day.  Stop it.  We all bought into it, though.  We didn't know.  No.  We were just little effers.  Yeah.  Trying to learn something.  Bunch of drunks teachers are.  Well, wouldn't you be?  Yes.  Don't get paid much.  You do get sick from every kid in your class.  Deal with little animals.  Every day.  With their little boners.  Well, somebody.  Some.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Out of trepidation of youth. 
[00:20:30]  Here's the second half of the story.  This lovely teacher aide.  Gilligan told me her 16-year-old daughter was thrilled about the Obama election,  and she took the comments from the teacher's aide as personnel.  Being biracial, she was overjoyed that someone of color was elected,  and she was so happy and excited to come to school,  and for this teacher to yell these things at her and her fellow classmates was just unbelievable.  Gilligan said her daughter was upset by the aide's comments, and so was she. 
[00:21:00]  I mean, if you believe something, that's fine, but you don't have to yell at other people,  especially our youth that are excited about the election.  I mean, anybody should want that to happen, especially a teacher.  And for you to destroy that, you know, joy that they have because of an election is terrible.  Well, no, it's not.  Destroying.  Everything is destroying and horrible and terrible.  It's dumb what she did, but it gets the little efforts ready for the real world.  Obviously, it shows that the teacher's aide has no sense. 
[00:21:30]  No, of course not.  No little bit of smarts there to keep your yap shut.  The teacher's aide has to go.  I mean, look, I'm off for free speech, but if you're in school and you're a teacher's aide,  and you say the flag's going to be changed to the KFC flag, how can you keep your job shut?  It just shows.  It's not like they said it in their private life.  If you're at school, you've got to go.  It shows a huge lack of judgment.  Yeah, what a dope.  You know, who cares about what they said?  It's the fact that where they said it, and that's like. 
[00:22:00]  This is an example of so fired.  We talk about so fired.  This one is not even one of those gray areas.  So fired.  Yeah, and the privacy you're on home or with your friends.  Whatever, but.  You know, on leaflets that you leave under windshield wipers.  Moving on up.  Kind of hack, isn't it?  Oh, of course it is.  All right.  What's that story about the Sopranos?  They're doing a cologne or something?  Yeah, this has a little racial.  Also, that weirdo David Chase has decided no movie for the Sopranos. 
[00:22:30]  He didn't rule it out completely, though.  But for now, he's like, no movie for the Sopranos.  Yeah, he might as well until they're all older.  Wait until, yeah, it's irrelevant, really irrelevant, and they're all older and look silly.  Like Sex and the City, where it's just four hags walking around trying to seem sexy.  Yeah.  It'll be geriatric mobsters walking around.  Well, he's an artist, you know.  Yeah.  So.  Ugh.  Just make the stupid movie.  We all want it.  But anyway, they got a cologne out, Jimmy?  Well, it's more the story under it. 
[00:23:00]  There's two stories here in the post.  And it's just, I love the inconsistency in how they talk about groups.  Like Pauly Walnuts, whose real name is Tony Sirico, has a cologne out.  You know, wise guy cologne.  Who knows if it's good?  I don't know.  Hey, you want to smell like a guy who's a boss?  Whatever.  Yeah.  Good.  Terrific.  Ooh, watch out.  But whatever, you know.  I mean, it might be good stuff.  You know, you put it on.  And careful.  Better wear that.  You might get whacked.  Wait in. 
[00:23:30]  Hold on.  I got to turn it around.  It's the.  Oh, no.  Not the gay marriage montage.  It's all about the gay marriage montage.  That's what it's all about today.  Men kissing other men at these marriages.  From the back, two women.  One looks like Christine Whitman.  I was going to say the exact same thing.  Well, they're all getting married in Connecticut.  Sorry, Jimmy.  I don't know.  Don't be.  Every time I see the gay marriage montage, I got to like get everyone's.  You're obligated.  Believe me.  I'll look at you.  I want to see. 
[00:24:00]  I want to see like the.  You may kiss the.  The.  The.  You and him.  Just do what you got to do.  Go ahead.  Whatever you need.  You may kiss the thing.  And.  That's for the lesbians, by the way.  All right.  Go ahead.  So the cologne is called Paolo.  P-A-O-L-O.  Yeah.  And I don't know what it's like.  Apparently Tony Sirico is at a party.  You know.  Who knows.  Hey.  You want to smell something?  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  Forget about it.  They should call this forget about it. 
[00:24:30]  Because you put it on and you forget about it.  Oh.  Come on.  Everybody's laughing.  Have a little bottle of wine.  Whatever.  I'm sure it's terrific stuff.  You know.  Hey.  Don't drink it.  It's like wine.  You know.  Oh.  What's that cologne called?  Hey.  Be careful.  You know.  You got some indigo all over your arm.  Oh.  Get out of here.  Get a call of us.  Call of us.  But you know.  Whatever.  Like Tony Sirico.  So he's showcasing his cologne.  But it's not the cologne article. 
[00:25:00]  Which you know.  Whatever.  That's his product.  Underneath it.  It's this guy.  Whose name.  It's.  This guy's name.  The reporter for the news.  I just can't say it.  R-A-A-K-H-E-E.  Uh oh.  Rocky.  Uh.  Merchandani.  Is the.  Is the.  Columnist.  Or the.  The reporter.  And they're talking about the Sopranos cologne.  There's no hit with the ladies.  And they put hit little quote.  Hey.  Yeah.  Like a hit.  Huh?  Get out of here.  Don't see him no more. 
[00:25:30]  Not smelling fantastic anyway.  Hey.  You know what I mean.  He may sleep with the fishes.  But he don't smell like it.  Hey.  Leave the gun.  Take the cologne.  All right.  You never know.  You may have to put cologne on a whole bunch of guys.  Mixing your cologne with your meatballs.  Your sausage.  We can put the cologne behind the toilet.  I don't mind butter just coming out with a little deodorant in his hand.  You could put the cologne on the dead bodies to throw off the authorities too. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  You'll never smell them.  When the body starts stinking.  You know.  How's the cologne in this place?  Dear Grandpa.  You smell good.  You're grandson Frank.  This is leading up to a very good point.  It certainly is.  Because you still could like stereotype the hell out of the Italians.  Yes.  The Italians.  And this is the article.  Acqua di Gio it ain't.  Not even close.  But Tony.  Paulie won't let's Sirico's new cologne.  Paolo per homo.  Which I think means Paulie for him or something.  I don't know what it means. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Smells like every lasagna-loving, spaghetti-slurping mob boss wannabe or cheap imitation consigliere.  And it's just like personal.  I could care less about that.  Yeah.  But it's just amazing like with the Post.  Like any other nationality.  Maybe Irish.  Yeah.  Black.  Forget it.  Oh my God.  If you put in black stereotypical food.  Watermelons.  Soul food.  Right.  They would be out of their minds.  Yeah.  Or Jews.  You know.  Matzo ball eating.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or if you attack the-  Asians.  Oh.  Asians.  Forget it.  Oh my God.  Top of the list these days.  Right, John Liu?  Fried rice eating.  Or what about Spanish?  Yes.  You know what a-  Re-fried bean eating, something like that.  Yeah.  But for some reason, you could just get away with it with certain groups.  Because it wasn't like just-  And again, I'm not offended by it, but I could care less.  I don't care either, and I'm one of those Italians myself.  But it just shows you like how phony-  Yeah.  It's just another example of how phony the press is. 
[00:27:30]  I'd love to see that guy write an article about some black guy puts out, what, Diddy  puts out his perfume, his cologne.  Did he comment on that?  Yeah.  Every other, you know, fried chicken, blah, blah, blah.  Watermelon eating.  Shard skin, super.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Gangsta wannabe.  Yeah.  You know, where's that?  Yeah.  Double standards are ridiculous with the press. 
[00:28:00]  It really is.  It's just, that's infuriating.  Not what he said.  Like I said, who cares what he says about that?  But the fact that you could not get away with printing that if it was some other group.  No, maybe the Irish, you probably could.  Irish, you know, like, you know, every other drinking.  Potato eating.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't know.  Irish do.  Eat potatoes.  They boil stuff.  Then they drink.  Do a lot of boiling.  Corned beef and cabbage.  A lot of boiling.  That, but I just read that, I just thought it was like, yeah, kind of a, yeah, of course. 
[00:28:30]  Let's see.  Oh, and the first whiff.  No, more even.  At first whiff, we were sipping wine with Tony and Big Pussy at the Bada Bing.  A few more whiffs, and we sensed top notes of cigar ash and polyester jumpsuits with hints  of stripper sweat and a cream-filled cannoli.  Mmm.  Smells good.  Yeah.  Cream-filled cannoli and stripper sweat.  What?  This is horrible.  A, it's bad writing.  Sin number one.  Horrid. 
[00:29:00]  Bad writing.  She's a woman, by the way.  Who?  What is she?  How did you know?  Yeah, where is she?  We looked her up.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  Background?  Nationality?  I don't know.  Dark.  Can you see?  Kind of darkish.  Darkish as in African-American?  Or, uh...  Indian?  Kind of, maybe Indian.  I don't know.  Oh, oh, okay.  That explains the first name.  All right, let's see how she writes something like, uh, every other 7-11.  Or Dunkin' Donuts working.  Smells like curry.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She might be Italian.  Who knows?  You say no?  I don't think so.  It's not even the problem with her.  She's the paper.  Yeah.  Which wouldn't allow other stuff.  Of course not.  Yeah.  Is that her?  Oh, no.  It was a Brazil ad.  I, um...  I was going into a CVS the other day.  And an African-American woman was coming out.  And, um...  She was...  This was yesterday.  She's wearing an Obama button.  Mm-hmm.  A huge Obama button. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And she walked through me and hit me with her shoulder.  It's one of these automatic opening, you know, Star Trek turbo lift doors.  Um...  And it opens up.  It's glass.  So she saw me and just bumped right into me, walked right through me.  And I was...  I was just like, all right.  Okay.  This is where we're at now.  This is where...  Oh!  At 100%. 
[00:30:30]  One shoulder bump!  Dude!  There was no reason for it.  Mm-hmm.  She was a bitch, that's all.  A C with a giant Obama 08 button on.  He won.  He's gonna be president.  Wait, she's still wearing the campaign button?  And walking through Whitey.  C. Now, with this attitude, this attitude she had that bugged me, more than just a C attitude.  It just bothered me. 
[00:31:00]  I just...  I see it coming.  See it coming!  What?  Getting bumped into?  This attitude.  This attitude.  I'm seeing it.  It's happening.  But take pleasure in the fact that there's gonna be a huge disappointment out there.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  It really is.  It doesn't matter.  The disappointment isn't gonna be as big as the uplifting.  The disappointment's gonna be over a lot of time.  A lot of uplifting.  The big uplifting.  Which, I'm not against uplifting, but it comes at my expense with this...  This...  Ugh. 
[00:31:30]  This ugly woman shoulder bumping me.  Mm-hmm.  Me!  Of all people, you!  Of all people, me!  You!  As I'm walking in.  Huge glass, solid glass door.  It's not like you don't see another person coming through the door.  Right.  So that really ticked me off.  Well, speaking of that, they did a poll.  72% of Americans believe Obama will fix the economy.  Uh-huh.  Good luck. 
[00:32:00]  Exactly.  Good luck.  Let's say hi to Mike in Virginia.  Mike?  Mike?  Yo, man.  What's up?  What's up, Mike?  Let me ask you a question.  I have one question.  Do white people eat watermelon?  Do they eat fried chicken?  You know something?  Let me let you in on a little secret, my friend.  And every morning, I have a giant thing of watermelon.  I love this stuff.  From a health standard, I get it.  No, I just love it. 
[00:32:30]  I get it.  It tastes good.  Yeah, yeah.  I was just listening to the comments, Nick.  You guys are just funny sometimes.  At least, I'm pretty good commentary on you guys.  Yeah, well.  I'm trying to know.  You did.  You did.  I'm not sure why you're asking, do white people eat watermelon fried chicken?  Of course we do.  Well, because as I was looking through a show earlier, a few minutes ago, you were making reference to when she made the reference to the Italian and the different stereotypes.  And then it went back to, you know, about the watermelon and the fried chicken. 
[00:33:00]  But you understood what I was saying, though.  What I was talking about is just typical stereotypes and how they don't do it in certain ways.  You know I'm not saying white people don't do it.  They would never write that in the newspaper, stereotypical foods of African-Americans.  Or Asians or quite as much anyone else.  The Italians are still safe for some reason.  Spaghetti slurping?  Right.  You know, lasagna eating.  That's, you know.  But you know what's really interesting?  And this is why I made the reference to Patrice O'Neal.  I think maybe it was an earlier show a couple of weeks ago that he talked about the lack of authenticity in your racism. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, if a black person is racist, you know he's racist, and they're unyielding in it.  And sometimes if you're racist, and sometimes not even just racism, it's just you're just responding to events.  And not everybody get mad when you say something stereotypically black.  It's just sometimes, I think, if you're just truthful and open about it after a little while, we won't be so mad, you know? 
[00:34:00]  Well, I'm not sure what you're saying, to be very honest with you.  Yeah, you're right.  I'm not 100% sure what you're saying.  I think you're falling short.  Yeah, what do you mean?  Well, my point is, sometimes I feel you guys are really racist, and so I won't listen to you for about a week.  Then I'll come back and you'll say something really profound, and I'm so, like, on the edge, like, okay, are they racist or are they not? 
[00:34:30]  And so it may be just a part of who I am and my socialization and understanding who you guys are.  You know what it is?  You won't lose your job if you're racist, you know, if you're working.  You won't lose your job if you're racist.  We lose our jobs if white people are racist.  Isn't that fun?  Wouldn't that be a fun thing?  If you express your views about whitey at work and you got fired, oh, my God, there'd be outrage. 
[00:35:00]  I'm just talking.  What?  I got freedom of speech.  I'm just talking about something.  For us, it's you're racist.  You're fired.  Leave.  Your career's done.  Go away.  Can I say something?  I think you know that we're not racist.  The thing is, it's like you're so used to hearing, at least in the last 10 years, white people tiptoe around race and be completely dishonest about being annoyed.  Like, when you hear black people talking about being annoyed at white people, like you just said, sometimes it's reactive.  Well, then how come, you know, like when we're saying stuff, it just can't be reactive to a particular event? 
[00:35:30]  Do you know what I mean?  You're just not used to hearing white people be open and honest about being annoyed or not being annoyed at any given moment, whereas with any other group, it's acceptable because it's all seen as a reaction to white terribleness.  Well, a lot of it, I think, has to do with, again, it points to our socialization.  And what I mean by that is most black people have to work for white people.  Most white people don't have to work for black people, so their exposure is a little different.  Now that things, and I'm not talking just because Obama has been elected, but now that there, in the last 10 to 15 years, that there has been a broadening of the economic landscape. 
[00:36:00]  More whites and blacks are working together, so there's a little more comfort zone, and it's not a hierarchical, it's not white over black anymore.  It's more a lateral or equal, you're dealing on equal footing.  And so, yes, I understand your point about if you say something horribly racist, sometimes you will lose your job. 
[00:36:30]  I've lost the job because I've been perceived as being, I guess, anti-white.  I'm not anti-white, I'm not pro-black, but I have a grasp of the issues.  And so if someone says something, and I challenge it, and because I am a pretty big guy, sometimes it strikes a fear on a primordial level instead of on the conscious or intellectual level. 
[00:37:00]  We have the same thing, though, except we're not big guys.  You know what I mean?  You're saying kind of the same thing we do, except we're just not big dudes.  Hey, I just want to say, I do love you guys, Joe, and I really appreciate you for what you do.  All right, Mike.  Thank you, Mike.  Mike in Virginia.  Let's go to Laura in Massachusetts, listening on BCN.  What's up, Laura?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yesterday, I had the exact same thing happen to me at the mall.  There was an uppity-end woman walking with her kid, all dressed fancy at the mall, and she walked directly towards me and my two kids. 
[00:37:30]  And I had to let go of one of my children's hands and push them away, because I realized she wasn't going to go around us.  And I'm here holding my two kids' hands.  She was uppity.  And we were, like, playing Red Rover.  I had to let go and, like, push them away so she could walk through us.  And I was just like, oh, my God, I can't believe that just happened.  This is something that I've noticed.  Believe me, I'm very conscious of things like this.  You're going to start noticing this more, because I think I noticed first, because, you know, because I'm such a racist. 
[00:38:00]  I noticed there is this walking through you thing that black people are starting to do.  I've noticed this.  Try to take note of this.  They're not moving out of the way.  And I'm not saying, move aside for a white man.  What are you doing?  And, you know, I'm not saying that, but there's this common courtesy thing where you kind of move out of each other's way.  There is this now, I'm not moving out of your goddamn way. 
[00:38:30]  And I'll bump you.  Absolutely.  I'll make you separate your held hands.  I'll make you, you know.  I've had just the, honest to God, I've had just the opposite on the subway and stuff, just the opposite reaction from people,  where I just feel like people have been just more courteous.  Dude, honestly.  Oh, Jimmy.  Miss, first of all, how can you, you call up and say she's an uppity N-word, because she walked,  listen, Sandy Duncan, what else did you, did she spit in your water and stir it before she handed it back to you? 
[00:39:00]  No.  Shut up.  Why don't you call somebody that just plows through you as you're walking through?  Of course I'm a McCain person.  I'm not even saying that the lady, the black lady who did it wasn't a racist.  I don't know what the black lady was.  But just her attitude, come on, please.  I think in general humans don't like moving out of the way, because I've had many bumps with white people in my neighborhood.  I'm moving out of the way.  I have body checked more old ladies than I could count, because they refuse to get out of my way.  Get out of my way.  Where you're to the point where now you're going to have to step in bushes or around a tree, 
[00:39:30]  just so, because they won't move over on the sidewalk, so I just lower my shoulder and I go.  I go for it.  Do you like blocking?  Oh, yeah, and I've had a few women, hey!  I'm like, well, what was I supposed to do?  How about the three?  Walk in the bushes?  Three large dudes.  Huh?  How about if it's three?  I've done it with guys, too, which is stupid on my part.  I absolutely have.  What happened to the old, you know what I noticed?  It doesn't happen much anymore.  The old standoff where you come up to somebody and you do that, I don't know which way to go thing. 
[00:40:00]  The after you.  No, after you.  After you.  You both jog to the right and the left and each other's stuff, and then you kind of giggle and go around each other.  Like, that doesn't happen much anymore because you just walk through each other.  Stupid Gaffigan.  Jim Gaffigan had a very funny joke about that.  When you're at that moment, he goes, I just lean in and kiss him.  That was very funny.  I think it's everyone.  I think everyone thinks they're the most important person on the sidewalk, in the mall, in the light aid. 
[00:40:30]  Honestly, I've had the ‚Äì I'm not even being disagreeable.  I honestly have had like a noticeably different ‚Äì people just be ‚Äì almost like I feel like ‚Äì and again, I could just be reading into something that doesn't exist.  But I almost feel like people just nicer.  I see it completely opposite.  Really?  I can't remember the last time I saw Common Courtesy.  I don't care if it was black, white, whatever.  I'm only talking about black-white interaction.  I am not more comfortable.  I just see human beings in general just with the attitude and the I'm more important than you, so I will not move when I'm walking toward you. 
[00:41:00]  I will not hold a door for you.  All that crap.  That's probably because you're seeing white people as being a little more nervous, Jimmy.  I bet.  No, no.  I'm talking about my reaction.  You'll see white people now are looking at black people and thinking, okay, they got the head guy there, the president-elect, and I'm just going to sit here and take my place and be nice. 
[00:41:30]  No, I'm only judging my reaction, like the way people have been ‚Äì yeah, yeah, yeah, like my ‚Äì not to kill us, but the way people are doing my thing.  I'm looking at it just the opposite.  Look, maybe I'm naive.  I'm just almost like ‚Äì there's a black president who was ‚Äì let's be honest ‚Äì who was elected by more white people than voted for John Kerry.  I mean, you know, white people love this guy.  Black people didn't elect Obama.  I mean, the majority of people who voted for him are white.  More people voted for McCain.  More white people voted for McCain than voted for Obama.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, that's a stat. 
[00:42:00]  All right, fair enough.  That's a legitimate stat.  It's still a lot of ‚Äì it's still ‚Äì  Yeah, yeah, it's still a lot.  Believe me.  Oh, no, I understand.  He wasn't elected by just black and Spanish vote.  Right.  No.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Wow, that got the phones lit.  We'll go right to the phones after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  We should go right back to the phones.  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-ON-A.  Let's say hi to Steve in the Bronx.  What's up, Steve? 
[00:42:30]  Steve, you're on.  What's up, man?  Steve.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  The nice intro back into the radio show.  Yes.  And Steve wrecks it.  I think he's listening to the radio.  All right.  Screw Steve.  Nick in Illinois, what's going on, buddy?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  My wife and I are truckers all across the country, and I want to let you know something  about the attitude.  The attitude is not exclusive to blacks.  However, it does permeate amongst their ranks.  All over the country, people bump into us when we're walking in places, and usually it's 
[00:43:00]  low-life punk kids, where people with that attitude, like, you know, nothing's going to  touch me, that wannabe gangster.  The fact is, we were at a fuel stop once, I think it was in the inner city in Memphis,  and this girl serving us, wannabe white gangster girl, hocked up a loogie while she was serving  us, and spit it into a garbage can in front of us. 
[00:43:30]  That's the kind of real-life attitude, and that's what Anthony's talking about.  These people, they just have an attitude, but it isn't only exclusive to blacks.  No, I never said that.  If that came across like that, please.  I've been walking around for years getting bumped into by a multitude of a-holes, in malls  especially.  You walk around, and people just, first of all, they either aren't looking where they're  going, don't care.  They have a big gaggle family with them that they're taking up the entire aisle, so you 
[00:44:00]  can't even get past them.  I mean, these things are just lack of courtesy that is all over the place.  It doesn't matter what your race is.  Believe me, I've been knocked into by a hundred times more white people than I have black people.  I'm just saying the reasoning behind it, and I'm speculating here because, like Jim said,  it's very early on in this change of regime, but I'm starting to notice, I think because 
[00:44:30]  I'm very sensitive to it, I just am, that I'm starting to notice this weird attitude that  is coming across.  When a woman wearing a giant Obama 08 button, this thing was giant, Obama 08 button, walks  through and is looking right at me, there's plenty of room for two people, at least two  people to pass by, and she slams into me with her shoulder, I take that as not just a mistake, 
[00:45:00]  not just that she's some inconsiderate bitch, which I've been bumped into before by them.  That's fine.  I took it as, hey, look who my president is, and I'm not taking any crap from you anymore,  and bumped into me.  That's how I interpreted it.  Whether I'm accurate or not, I don't know, but that's my interpretation of what happened.  I was there.  I'm the one that felt it.  I saw it.  I saw her.  I saw the look in her eyes. 
[00:45:30]  I saw the button.  I saw the whole scene.  And to me, it came across as, hey, I'm not taking any crap anymore.  Bam, there you go.  You're getting a little shoulder check.  I'm going to open my eyes today when I'm walking around, and I'm going to see if it's a little  different out there.  Let's say I had a booger couch.  I could be talking out my ass.  I don't know.  Booger.  Hey, good morning, boy.  Good morning, booger.  Hey, Ant.  Yes, sir?  Were you wearing your N-word mania t-shirt when that woman bumped you?  No, I was not.  I don't have one of those. 
[00:46:00]  Huh?  All right, let's go to Toby in Cleveland.  LeBron James, 41 points last night.  I'm keeping track.  What's up, Toby?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I run into this all the time at supermarkets.  Yep.  It's actually kind of been really weird in Cleveland because we had so much of a turnout  for Obama that people are just, like, living on cloud nine here as if they, you know, I  mean, gas is like $1.80 here.  Yeah, well, the gas prices went way down. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, no, I'll be walking through, like, a store, and just people just run right into  me.  They'll run right into my girlfriend.  And I'm 6'5".  I'm not a tiny guy.  So...  I'm trying to get his point.  Yeah, what are you getting at?  Well...  It says everyone thinks they're better than...  Well...  I've actually resorted to grunting at people.  Oh, yeah.  They'll be walking up to me, and I'll just have to be like... 
[00:47:00]  And I've sworn at, like, old women because they're just running into me.  And my girlfriend's kind of small, and she thinks that she's invisible.  And it's got nothing to do with color.  What's going on?  I don't know, Toby.  We're going to have to bail on you.  It says everyone thinks they're better than everyone now.  Poor Toby.  Can't communicate.  Yeah, let's go to Yonkers.  Marcos.  What's up, Marcos?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, Marcos.  Love you, man.  Thank you, man.  You know, I just wanted to say that I agree with both sides of the story. 
[00:47:30]  You know, ever since President Barry won the election, I've seen, you know, people hold  doors open for me, be very courteous.  And at the same time, I've also seen...  I overheard this black lady one time saying, oh, why are they crying on TV for?  That ain't for them.  That wasn't for the white people.  That was for us.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen a lot of that, too, where it's my...  I saw my president is black t-shirts that some guys uptown were wearing. 
[00:48:00]  My president's black.  Like, it's like, why am I president?  How about the president of the United States?  Ugh.  Well, the media's making a big point, you know.  Well, a big point to say that it's the first black president.  It'll wear off.  It's, again, it's a weird thing for all of us.  No, that doesn't wear off.  It's permanent.  Let's go to Michigan.  Brian, for four years, he's going to be black.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show, Brian. 
[00:48:30]  How are you?  Hey, I'm doing good.  Good.  Hey, my 13-year-old nephew got dragged out of class the other day because he said we have  a black president.  You know, it was Wednesday after the election.  He just made a comment, hey, we have a black president.  The teacher took offense.  They have one little black girl in class, and that was his reasoning for it.  And they drug him to the office, put him in a back room for two hours for the rest of  the day.  Why?  And let him sit there. 
[00:49:00]  How did he say it, though?  How did that come up?  He was just talking to one of his little pals, I guess, and just said, hey, we have a black  president.  No.  So, you know, it wasn't, you know, he doesn't even know the meaning of being racial.  How old is he?  And wrote him up for making racial comments.  There you go.  Who knows?  Maybe it was a conversation taking place before that, and then he goes, well, we got a black  president.  Yeah.  One of those things.  Either way, it's silly.  It could be, but, you know, being 13 years old, too, you know.  All right.  Just give him a good spanking. 
[00:49:30]  Well, we all know that the schools are filled with no tolerance at this point.  Yeah.  Sickening.  Yeah, exactly.  Instead of a case-by-case basis, which I'm so glad I dropped out.  Yeah, me too.  High school dropout.  Really stupid to take it by a case-by-case basis, right?  Yes.  No tolerance.  That's smart.  Lindsay Lohan.  This leads to the Lindsay Lohan thing.  She said that she's happy about Obama being our first colored president.  Did she say that?  I think so.  And I know you were a really big Obama supporter, so tell me what that night meant for you. 
[00:50:00]  It was really exciting.  It was such a, I mean, it's an amazing feeling.  It's a whole, it's our first, you know, colored president, so that's like, it's, I'm so thrilled  to be a part of, you know, the country while that's going on, and that actually came into  vision.  So it's, it's, I mean, it's great.  Hmm.  But she, she's such a dummy.  She was probably trying to be profound and say person of color.  Person of color.  Dumb bitch.  I know, I absolutely picked up that too, that it's like, you could tell by the way 
[00:50:30]  she's talking, there's no, uh, nothing evil behind that.  She didn't want to say black, because, you know, that's become a dirty word.  Yeah.  It's just black anymore.  So she's trying to say, you know, person of color, of person.  Yeah.  You know why the word black has become such a bad thing?  Because that's how it was, a police would describe a, um, a suspect.  It's like blackmail or whatever.  And it just became something that black people didn't want to hear anymore.  So now it's African-American.  Oh.  Regardless of where you're from or where you live.  Right.  I love that, where people in Africa go, there are a lot of African-Americans there. 
[00:51:00]  It's like, no, it's Africa, you dummy.  You're just Africans.  They're Africans.  Right.  Uh, Jack in Cleveland.  Hey, yeah, hey, guys.  I'm a truck driver.  LeBron James, 41 points last night.  I'm paying attention.  Hi, Jack.  Whatever, I'm an Indian fan.  Anyway, uh, yeah, I'm a truck driver, and, you know, race relations have gotten better.  I think what it is is they could smell, they could see, they could just look at your face,  and they know you voted for McCain just because you're grimacing at them.  And then they just, you know, yeah, whatever, they're going to push past you. 
[00:51:30]  I look at black people, I smile because I know they voted the same way I did, and they've  been nothing but nice to me.  Maybe it's your smile.  I think they're better.  Yeah, sir, let's get a hold of yourself, too.  You're making it seem like it's a trip down Candyland.  Yeah.  I smile at the blacks.  We do-si-doe in the middle of the street.  Hope you get your teeth bashed in.  When you're smiling one day.  I know, guess who I voted for?  Who cares?  Yeah.  All right, guy, you talk while I'm making a joke.  Right, guy.  Yeah, yeah, no problem.  No, it's your joke.  You go ahead.  All right.  That's what I was trying to do.  I'm going to do just that.  I agree with Amanda. 
[00:52:00]  She's calling from Massachusetts.  Amanda, go ahead.  I was just calling, Chris.  I was saying, now that we have a new black president, I think that people are starting  to notice more and more that the prettiestness is not there.  But I think it's always been there.  It's just we're starting to notice it more and more.  People have always had, like, no manners and no more respect for people, especially children  having respect for their elders.  It's just people are starting to notice it more and more. 
[00:52:30]  But this world needs to change, I guess.  Yeah, maybe, you know, it's more noticeable.  I think you have a noticeable.  You ever buy a new car, you notice that car on the road more and go, I never noticed how  many of these there are out there.  And then you give them a toot-toot, like, toot-toot.  I'm driving the same car as you, buddy.  Well, you notice every ding on the bumper that you won't notice after a while.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Things like that.  I have a Cadillac, Caddy Courtesy.  Of course, Caddy Jimmy.  What's Caddy Courtesy?  What's that?  What's Caddy Courtesy anymore?  It's when one Cadillac, my car, just automatically, I'll give a friendly toot and let the other 
[00:53:00]  Caddy emerge in front of me.  Toot-dee-doo.  It's just a little community we have.  Yeah, why not?  Amongst the Caddy drivers, I understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes we'll give the Caddy wink.  Yeah, just kind of wink.  Hey, I understand you got a Caddy.  Yuck.  Now I'm going to get it down on the radio.  It's like it's stuck with my hind.  Warren, you notice the exact car on the road.  Warren, you go, never noticed how many of you are on out there.  You're a two-and-two, like two-and-two, like two-and-two, like two-and-two, like two-and-two. 
[00:53:30]  Hello?  Hi, Warren.  We were just listening to you listening to the radio.  Hi, Warren.  Turn down the radio and say what you want to say.  Say again?  Yeah, exactly.  Listen.  Oh.  It's very easy.  We love our listeners.  We love taking a lot of phone calls.  Just turn down your radio if you're on hold.  He said if she didn't have a big black Obama pin on her.  Right.  A big black Obama pin.  It was a big pin of Obama on her.  If she didn't have the pin on, would I have felt the same way?  Mm-hmm.  And no, that was probably not. 
[00:54:00]  I would have just thought she was a bitch.  Right.  I don't know.  It was just that pin and the whole attitude.  It was the whole picture there.  Everything that happened.  The circumstance of the bump was in ‚Äì it wasn't in close quarters.  If it was coming in and out of an elevator, I would have understood.  I would have given the benefit of the doubt.  This is ‚Äì those double giant opening, self-opening doors at a CVS.  You've seen these things?  You've seen these things? 
[00:54:30]  No, they're giant.  Plenty of room for everyone.  Plenty of room.  So why didn't you move out of the way?  Because I was kind of out of the way.  She kind of went out of her way to bump me, is what I'm saying.  It was a weird thing.  There was enough room there.  Maybe she just recognized you.  That was also an option.  Perhaps she did.  And she listens.  She listens.  And that was her way of going.  Listen.  All right.  I'll give her that.  Shut up, cracker.  Yeah, well, Ryan has a guarantee. 
[00:55:00]  Ryan in Philly.  Hey, guys.  Flyers beat the Islanders 3-1.  I'm paying attention.  Wow.  Greg, good job, Greg.  Good to hear.  Thank you, sir.  Not a problem.  Anyways, over to you, Anthony.  Yes.  You mean to tell me when you saw that beautiful button of hers laying above her right shoulder  that you didn't just look at it like sun glare, like a black hole?  I know.  You just looked at it and just grimaced like it was the worst thing you ever saw.  She read it in your face. 
[00:55:30]  You're the easiest person to read.  Don't lie, Anthony.  Do not lie.  Well, that's a very good question.  Let me think.  Did you have some body language going on?  I noticed.  Maybe you weren't purposely with the body language, but most of us are very easy to read when something's  going on emotionally.  I did notice the button a split second before the bump.  Before the check?  So I'm not sure if she, like, saw that, felt that.  But I did look at the button, and then after the bump, I went, ugh.  I said, ugh, he's elected already. 
[00:56:00]  I don't care, Anthony.  You're a scumbag, Jimmy.  I love your breath.  Thank you.  Wow.  I don't like your meanness to Anthony, though.  I don't understand.  Where's the love?  Where's the love?  I've been getting some nasty comments, too, on my MySpace and things like that.  You know, nasty comments from people.  You're a racist.  You're this.  And then they spell out reasons why that don't make any sense.  Eh, just shut up.  And then I just write back and insult their mothers and call their mothers whores. 
[00:56:30]  Really?  That's all I ever do is try to just attack their moms.  I gave up the fight.  The Internet wins.  Dead, yeah.  The Internet wins.  Internet won?  Yeah, I gave up.  You let the Internet just win?  I used to fight those individual battles.  Ah, the Internet.  Congratulations.  You win.  Mike in Jersey.  How are you, Mike?  Not bad, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I just wanted to kind of shed a little light on this.  I'm a black American.  And, you know, any blacks out there with the intent that Obama's going to change the world 
[00:57:00]  just because he got elected, they're out of their minds.  First of all, you need to realize that this guy's only going to, like you said, it's going  to be business as usual.  He's not going to change the world for us.  I think he's going to give it a hell of a try, though, man.  It's going to be democratic business as usual, which we haven't seen in a while, so it's going  to seem a little different, but it's more just policy.  He's not going to come out with these new things.  It's going to be the same stuff that Democrats have done for years, the same policies they're 
[00:57:30]  going to push, and he's got the backing of Congress, so he's going to get a lot of these  things through.  So in that, you're going to see change, but you're not going to see this big change that  he's going to, you know, it's going to cost me money.  I know that.  It might cost me some of my guns that I want, which sucks.  But, you know, that's just part of having Democrats in there.  The comment in the paper about the Italians and they slurp spaghetti and things like that,  and why can't you do it with any other race, I know it's hard for whites to understand right 
[00:58:00]  now that, you know, well, if it's a black issue, it's a big deal.  If it's Asian or if it's any other race, see, it's hard for you to, and it's hard for me  also, it's hard for you to put your, to step into somebody else's shoes, especially if  you're a different race.  So blacks for a long time have always been going through a bunch of crap, and, you know,  so it's a more sensitive issue if you're black than it is if you make a comment about a white. 
[00:58:30]  But no, what we're dealing with, too.  Because we've always been making fun of the Italians, you know, look at the Sopranos,  look at all these other shows that we make, that we throw comments out at.  So what we're dealing with, though, the problem is, is it's this phony white policing.  It's almost like white people are comfortable with you just making fun of white people  because they still feel realistic and intellectually superior.  So they're like, well, let the adults tease the adults, but don't go after the children 
[00:59:00]  or the inferior.  You understand that that inconsistent self-policing by whites is really a sign of elitism, and  I don't know how people don't get that.  That's what's irritating about it.  Right.  Well, Jimmy, I understand everything you're saying, and I have to, I still protect myself  a little bit.  You know, I have white friends, I have black friends, and a lot of my white friends say  to me that, you know, I'm the whitest black guy they've ever known.  That's insulting, right?  And, you know, and I tell them a bunch of, I tell them they're all a bunch of idiots 
[00:59:30]  because, you know, why can't I, I was brought up in a good neighborhood, I was brought up  by great parents, I have an education, so why can't it just be that, you know, I'm an intelligent  guy or I'm a smart guy?  Why does it got to be, it's always with them, sometimes it's a black and white issue.  And that's what, the point I'm trying to get across to you guys is that, you know, you  have to kind of put yourself in other people's shoes with the sensitivity on it, that's  why a lot of people are always saying Anthony is a racist and stuff like that. 
[01:00:00]  I don't think that Anthony is a racist, I just, I think he's hilarious, and he's just  bringing out a bunch of points.  Wow, this guy's your, uh, your best friend today.  My doppelganger?  Sure.  Thank you, Mikey.  All right, we got one more call before the break, uh, no name here on the screen, it  says, I'm black, hate other black people.  You.  Go.  Huh?  Where are you calling from, sir?  What's going on?  Hey.  Uh, I agree with the last caller.  Um, I grew up in the South Bronx, went to a Catholic school and everybody looks at me 
[01:00:30]  in my community like I'm a sellout because I don't speak with slang and I don't hang  out with black people, you know?  And I think it's wrong.  It's just, it's so stupid and so ignorant just because I speak with diction and I use,  uh, you know, proper English, all of a sudden I'm a sellout because I don't smoke weed on  a corner and I have a job.  Yeah, and sounding, uh, you know, gangster.  It's, it's, it's, it's really aggravating, you know, but, you know, I agree with you guys. 
[01:01:00]  You're not racist.  You guys say how it is.  A lot of black people are lazy and they just don't want to do nothing.  I don't know if we officially said that.  No, we say, we say our opinions on stuff.  We might have hit it a few times.  A lot of them are lazy and they don't want to do nothing.  We say our opinions, man, but it's like, it's like the thing is everybody gets so obsessed  with being right.  It's like we're wrong half the time too.  I know, I know.  And an opinion is just that, an opinion.  I don't know why you can't, you can't say them. 
[01:01:30]  Your opinions are usually based on, you know, what you've been through, what you've experienced,  what you read, whatever, and then you form your opinion.  And in this country, at least until recently, you've been allowed to voice that opinion  and then have a dialogue about it with other people who disagree with that opinion.  That's, that's great.  It's a great thing.  But we've, we've gotten to this point where you just, you can't do that anymore because  there's a fear of, of losing your job there.  It is a weird situation that we, I didn't really see coming as far as one of those, 
[01:02:00]  the future things.  I think it makes people angrier too, that you can't, when you feel like you can't express  yourself, it gets really frustrating.  Why does a conversation about race have to be labeled hate speech all of a sudden?  Like it's a, it's a racial conversation.  You're having a conversation about your opinions and other people's opinions on race.  And then it becomes, well, if that's just hate speech and you're racist, it's like,  okay, throw the catchphrases around and totally now take every point I made and throw it away 
[01:02:30]  under the guise of it being racist and hate speech.  And the only way to deal with stuff like that, you're completely right, is everybody tries  to tiptoe around it and be, and be like polite with these thought policing scumbags.  Nope.  The only way to deal with them is to blast them.  Headlong right into it.  That's my, that's my take.  Very good.  Let's break out.  Quick break.  There was a couple of really good things.  Oh, the Swedish bestiality ring exposed.  What?  People don't understand what the big deal is.  And some great Madonna stuff in the paper today. 
[01:03:00]  But do we get our money back on those goddamn videos that we're not going to get?  Get it?  Yeah, I got it.  Of course, I get it, Jim.  Oh, run, Jim.  That was me into a Ram's hiney, crashing.  The Madonna stuff is, yuck.  Oh, she stinks.  Yuck.  We'll explain next.  Hold on to your hat.  Da, da, da, da, da.  Opie and Anthony.  Tomorrow night's the big game. 
[01:03:30]  The big one.  Yeah.  Pats and Jets.  Come on.  Who's not watching that tomorrow?  Yeah.  Maybe the people in Cleveland.  I understand.  Good morning, Cleveland.  877-212-ON-A.  All right.  We're going to try to move on, but the phone's still hot.  It's a hot topic.  We're in the middle of a hot topic.  Jaggy, Jersey.  How are you?  Jaggy, Jersey. 
[01:04:00]  How are you?  Good.  Thanks.  Hi, guys.  All right.  What do you got, man?  Well, I'm just wondering why you've got to be such a big crybaby because some bitch bumped,  some biatch bumped into you at the supermarket.  You've been crying about it for a half an hour now.  Come on.  Grow up.  Man up.  All right.  Jaggy, let me explain, please.  I wasn't crying about it.  I commented about it, and the reason we went on a half hour about it was because a lot  of people call up because it's a radio show.  See?  So we throw a subject out there. 
[01:04:30]  No, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's a radio show.  People then call up with their experiences, whether they agree or disagree, and we have  a dialogue, and it's an amazing thing that it's called talk radio.  You understand now?  I do.  Oh, I got you.  Let me ask you this.  Let me ask you this first thing.  If you were in a shop right and some large Jewish gentleman bumped into you wearing a  yarmulke with his, you know, the little threads that they were, I'm not sure what they're 
[01:05:00]  called, but would you make a race issue out of it or a culture issue out of it?  If President Bernstein had just been elected and he was wearing a Bernstein 08 button and  bumped into me, then I probably would be making an issue of it.  I've been bumped into by black people, white people.  It doesn't matter.  And I usually just write it off as you're being an inconsiderate ass or bitch or bastard,  whatever it is.  But that, to me, was a different issue. 
[01:05:30]  I felt something different with the woman that bumped into me the other day.  That's all.  I have way more white people that bump into me than black people.  I never have white people bump into me.  We smile at each other in a courteous way.  Yeah.  Nice.  The worst ones are the old broads with their ligaments.  I don't know what it's about with those ligaments when they get older, but they're tough to  get around.  Yes.  You try to move them out of the way.  Ligaments.  Jared in Boston. 
[01:06:00]  Unmoving.  Morning, boys.  Hi, Jared.  Jimmy, can't wait to see you on Saturday at the Wilbur Theater.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  It's like 52 days on Friday.  If you have 50 friends.  If you see a well-endowed woman that looks like a problem, that's why she's totally in  love with you.  Anyway, not a big change up here in Boston.  They've still got Roxbury, and they're part of Dorchester, and we've got everything else,  so I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, Boston's the only place that really hasn't changed much, I guess. 
[01:06:30]  They like that segregated city of theirs.  They're actually doing a recount.  They're hoping there's been an 8 million vote mistake.  And they can fix it.  Dave in New York, how are you?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning, Dave.  And happy birthday, Jamie.  Thanks, Emil, Dave.  Anyway, you know what?  $3 for a subway ride here in New York City?  I'm paying attention.  That would be insane, by the way.  But anyway, go ahead, Dave. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, Bloomberg, really in touch.  Vote him in again, people.  Hold on, Dave.  We're going to go off on a little rant.  We've got this mayor who's a billionaire, and we're in deep trouble, deep doo-doo here in  New York City, and they're starting to suggest that in 2009, a subway ride's going to cost  $3.  $3.  Who the F is going to be able to afford $3 on the subway whenever they want to move around  town?  And especially since he has rigged the game to the way he has fixed the streets, this  dummy, Bloomberg, who I used to like a lot, he's taking lanes away. 
[01:07:30]  It's like there's lanes, 42nd Street and 7th Avenue.  That's not a busy intersection.  No!  No one ever drives that way!  And he's taking it, and he's putting lines in the road where there's tables set up for  people to sip their cake.  Hey, Fruity Voice Mayor, what are you supposed to do from October to May?  What are we going to do in that space?  It's just going to be empty space and traffic congestion.  Jackass! 
[01:08:00]  He's trying his best, but since his traffic congestion policy didn't pass and got shot  down, he's now making it so inconvenient to drive that people beg for the traffic congestion  plan.  See, this is his little revenge plan.  Cutting lanes off for bicycle lanes only.  And now there's talk of tolls, putting tolls on the east side bridges.  Cutting off huge sections of Times Square for just pedestrians or tables and chairs. 
[01:08:30]  drivers, this is stuff that's going to aggravate drivers and say, do something.  And then he'll go, well, I tried to.  I said it a few years ago.  Times Square, it's going to come to a point where there's going to be no cars going through  there.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, yeah.  They're slowly but surely getting you used to that.  That's going to be an area where it's just people.  It's going to be another big block like Central Park in the middle of the city that you just,  you know.  You can't use.  You can't drive through.  It's just that.  They're slowly but surely strangling the traffic to move to the outskirts. 
[01:09:00]  And then they'll take a little more away, a little more.  And it's going to be like an open air mall or something.  The city.  Just for people.  Yeah.  This is not a country flea market.  This is Manhattan.  Yeah.  Manhattan.  God almighty.  New Amsterdam, Jimmy.  New Amsterdam.  He is really getting bad.  And that third term thing.  Wow.  Where was that when Rudy wanted to run, Mike?  Where was that when Rudy wanted to run after 9-11?  Yeah.  It turned out like two times it was put to vote by the people. 
[01:09:30]  And they said, no, we want a two-term limit on the mayor.  And in record time, this guy was able to slide this through and get where he's able to now run for a third term without a public vote.  And everyone thought he did a great job.  But we had a nice economy.  It always depends on the economy.  I mean, now we're in a horrible economic situation.  We'll see how great he really is.  That's why he's saying he should stay in a third term because he's a businessman. 
[01:10:00]  He knows how to run a business, especially in tough times, blah, blah, blah.  So that's why he's saying he wants to be voted in.  And we see how businessmen deal as far as loyalty is concerned.  They have none.  And again, most of them are just sharks.  And we all want to make money in the bottom line.  But a lot of the businessmen who run businesses, there's no humanity to most of you.  Most of you are just your bottom line men.  And you don't care who you fire or dump on underneath you. 
[01:10:30]  So I don't want a guy like that running the city.  Do you know AGI executives?  They found out even after this bailout, they have been going to these spas still and doing these things that just cost thousands of dollars.  Thousands.  Did you see their hotel bill?  I think the one was recorded at close to $400,000.  It's insanity.  Those are businessmen.  And they're still doing this.  Even being bailed out by the taxpayers, they're still just going out and wasting money. 
[01:11:00]  They should be taken out and shot.  They should just not be in the position to F people over like this.  How does the average Joe protest this stuff?  It's tough, man.  Like here in New York City, the amount of money that flows into the city, you just have to live here and walk around a little bit.  It's just amazing how much money is coming into the city.  And to tell the citizens that we're broke, it's just, what's going on? 
[01:11:30]  Really?  Where's that going?  What's going on really?  And how do you fix it?  Where's it going?  How do you fix it?  How do you do it?  You really got to limit these bailouts because now everyone's screaming bailout.  Every company now is going, we need a bailout.  We need a bailout.  Wouldn't you, though?  American Express just got like a classification of a bank so they can enjoy some of this $700 billion of a government bailout. 
[01:12:00]  AGI, like I said, they got money and they're going to spas and spending millions.  Now the automotive industry, GM and Ford, which are just tanking, they want money.  They want a bailout.  Right.  So every company now is going, it doesn't matter if we're that important to this country, if we're, you know, we've been here 100 years, they're not going to let us fail.  The country is here to bail us out.  How long can we do that before, you know, the government runs out of money with these bailouts or has to raise our taxes even more for this? 
[01:12:30]  It's a tough situation that I know Obama's just going to be able to get us out of.  Just because they're picky, it's AIG.  I think everyone knew what you were talking about.  But do the fact that it's my insurance company and I don't even know the name of it.  We got Bloomberg cutting the school budgets.  That's smart.  That's smart.  They should have called it AGI.  That's my tongue easier.  That's actually my agency.  Artist Group International is Pete. 
[01:13:00]  Well, they suck, too.  No, they're good.  Are they getting a bailout, Jimmy, this AGI?  They sure are.  They're using me as a big write-off.  The fact that these scumbags are taking these, they should just take it out of the, if you're making $200 million on it, just take it out of the executive's thing.  I don't care what the contract says.  Take it.  Well, my contract says, yeah.  We have guns.  You get nothing.  You wouldn't like that.  You're a bum.  Let's go to Dave in New York.  So, Dave, you started this.  I'm sorry we did the little tangent thing. 
[01:13:30]  Yes.  What do you got?  Oh, it's all right, boys.  I forgive you.  All right.  No, just actually two things now.  Well, first of all, it's not just, you know, bumping into people, but it seems like the other day I was holding the door for some very pretentious, and, you know, she walks right through with her big old Obama button and doesn't say thank you.  So I say, oh, you know, you're welcome. 
[01:14:00]  Because I thought maybe she said it, but I didn't hear.  And she said, oh, well, isn't that what you're supposed to do?  All right, well.  Oh, boy.  And my second part is Bloomberg Stinks for cutting the school budgets.  And third of all, question for a little Jimmy.  I need something to read, Jimmy.  What would you recommend?  Do you know what?  Well, I hate to plug my own book, but by golly, if you need something to read, I Hate Your Guts is a fine choice for the holidays.  And you got a signing coming up Thursday, I think?  No, tonight.  Oh, tonight.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  Barnes & Noble.  Thank you.  No, at Richmond Avenue in Staten. 
[01:14:30]  That's my first Staten Island event in years.  Staten Island.  Yeah.  7 p.m.  And tomorrow's borders on Providence Place in Rhode Island at 6 p.m.  Very good.  Tomorrow night.  Jimmy hitting the road.  Dennis from Long Island.  Everyone looks at Obama winning as white and black no matter what they say.  Maybe she thought you were looking at her boobies.  That's what Rich in Long Island is saying, Anthony.  Some women do get upset when you look at their boobies, even though they're, like, prominently displayed with the cleavage.  Yeah, sorry.  Jimmy from the NYPD will take his call. 
[01:15:00]  Jimmy, how are you?  I'm good, man.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Good morning.  Listen, I just, I got to agree with Anthony, and I think most people are agreeing with Anthony.  We are having a huge, huge problem in the NYPD.  I mean, it's so obvious that they're actually telling us.  They're saying, you can't arrest me, Obama's president.  And we're like, what are you talking about?  Yeah, like, you just committed a crime in front of us, you know?  Like, you pounded this old lady in the head and stole their purse, and you're going to tell me we can't arrest you because we now are, you know, we're going to have a black president. 
[01:15:30]  Like, the ignorance is spread rampant throughout the city.  And when Anthony says that this woman bumped into him, I absolutely, 100% believe it.  I picture the scene, because we're doing it in the street as police officers.  The attitude changes, you know?  They look at you, they feel like they can say what they want.  It's almost like doing the O.J. thing.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Very big difference, very different attitudes, and they felt like we had to lay back.  You know, we were actually told in roll call, too, listen, you know, lay back, let them, you know, riot, let them do this, let them do this.  Riot, are you kidding me?  Like, what happened to this country?  Everybody's afraid to follow the law.  Yep.  You know, it's insane.  All right, thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, see, there's a guy down on the street.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And Kate in Pennsylvania.  Kate.  Yeah, Anthony.  Yes.  What gives you the right to be better than everybody else? 
[01:16:30]  Ooh.  Well, Kate.  You did it.  Let me think about that for a second.  What gives me the right to be better than everybody else?  Yeah, because you're white?  Okay, well, no, no.  How have I portrayed myself as thinking or acting better?  If somebody bumps into you and you're going to make some big deal out of it, it's because she's wearing an Obama pin.  Yep.  Why?  Because he's black?  Yep.  No, no, no.  Now, Kate, let me tell you this.  I've been bumped into my whole life. 
[01:17:00]  Jimmy, you're an asshole.  I've been bumped into my whole life by people, and I never came on the air and said, well, today I got bumped into by a person that seemed to be of Irish descent.  Yeah, I don't talk about it.  It was an attitude.  It was a thing.  It was the big Obama button, elect Obama.  Now, he's been elected already.  Why still the button?  Because they're proud.  Well, along with this pride came this entitlement to be able to walk through me. 
[01:17:30]  It's not that I'm thinking I'm better.  She was thinking that she could walk right through me.  Maybe it was an accident.  That's right.  Exactly right, Kate, because it sounds to me like what's good for the goose is not good for the gander.  That's right.  I think Kate's making a good point here.  Kate, I think you may be a complete idiot.  Well, Kate, I may be.  You're right.  I may be.  And I think that...  Kate, I just want to get a little bearing on what kind of person you are and everything. 
[01:18:00]  How old a gal are you?  I'm 26.  All right.  And you live in Pennsylvania?  Yes.  When can you be out on Long Island?  Whenever you would like me to be.  All right.  We'll put you on hold, and I'll get your number.  We'll discuss this privately in my bed.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We have a potential cat fight happening here.  Marissa.  Sure.  Hi, Marissa.  You're on with Kate.  Call off.  Hi, Marissa. 
[01:18:30]  Who is this dumb fucking girl calling up saying...  That would be Marissa.  Yeah, try not to swear.  That's right, Kate.  I'm not dumb.  Right.  I just feel like, you know, a mistake was made.  The lady should have apologized.  Maybe she shouldn't have given an attitude, but I feel like Anthony is only acting this  way because the woman was black.  Yeah, of course.  Yes, of course.  We all know that.  Jimmy!  We try to make believe we don't see that. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, it is not.  I've been bumped into by white and black people and never mentioned it.  There was a different vibe to this one.  It's our job to make believe we don't see wasabi stuff, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Because this was different, and I saw it as different, and I'm just telling you, I'm telling  people that it was different.  But Kate raised a good point.  Kate, what was your point?  What point was that, Jimmy?  I'm sure you're going to rip into me now.  No, I'm not, actually.  Because you were saying that you think that he more noticed because she's black, and you 
[01:19:30]  say he's never come in saying that she was bumped into by whites.  Sure.  Yeah, he doesn't come in and say, hey, I was bumped into you today.  I said many times.  All right, we got another shot at a cat fight.  We love the cat fight.  Wendy in Louisiana, you're on with Kate and PA.  Hi.  Hi.  I disagree with that because I have people that I work with, and it's like half black  and half white, and the posters, and there are pictures everywhere, all over their desks.  They have pins on. 
[01:20:00]  I'm sorry, if McCain would have won, and we had all those kind of pictures, we kicked  your ass, and all that kind of stuff, uh-uh, that ain't flying.  Right.  Yeah, well, Allah.  Anthony.  I hear you.  Yes?  I love you.  Thank you, Kate.  I just wanted to see if I could get you riled up.  I was just, you know.  Oh, Kate.  Oh, Kate.  You see.  Oh, you.  You see.  All right, Jimmy, I love you very much. 
[01:20:30]  Thank you, Kate.  She's very loving.  And, uh, Opie, I could take care of Olivia.  I know.  Why don't you love Opie, Kate?  No, no, I love all you guys.  You guys are wonderful.  Because Opie's given his heart to another woman.  Yeah.  And, uh, and Anthony, I pretty much agree with everything you've said.  Thank you, Kate.  I knew it.  All right, go after her.  Nice.  Her name, Kate Hitler.  Nice.  You don't dare to dream.  There goes Kate.  All right.  So I didn't mean to sound like I was egging her on. 
[01:21:00]  Apologize.  You're an ass, Jimmy.  A little primetime gossip as we go to break.  You're back, and primetime gossip is taking a turn, moving into the world of celebrity news.  Pop-Tart superstar Beyonce Knowles has got her eyes on yet another prize.  Aside from having her third solo album on the way, she has her sights set on a new film role.  Beyonce wants to be the next Wonder Woman.  Hello, Diana. 
[01:21:30]  Hello.  Wonder Woman.  Oh, no, she didn't.  Oh, yes, she did.  Beyonce has said she would love to take over the role of Wonder Woman, and that, quote,  a black Wonder Woman would be a powerful thing.  It's time for that, right?  Right you are, Beyonce.  It's about time a role made famous by a white actor would finally be recast for a black actor.  Right, Cedric the Entertainer?  One day you are gonna push me too far.  The only thing that can push you is a bulldozer.  The honeymooners. 
[01:22:00]  If you ask PTG, not only has Beyonce proven herself to be both a horrendous actress and  human being, but her star power has about as much heat as Bernie Mac's corpse.  We understand you're barely holding onto that limelight, Beyonce, but keep the dopey suggestions  to yourself.  Making Wonder Woman black would not be empowering.  It would just be another reason to show off your giant ass on a movie poster.  Stay tuned as PTG continues to let you in on all the Hollywood gossip.  So Madonna's in the news, huh? 
[01:22:30]  You saw that, Jimmy?  I was so annoying, dude.  She's such a pompous bitch.  Like a boring...  She's like a hack pompous bitch.  She's going through a divorce and, um...  Oh, poor girl.  And, uh, she has some requests for Guy Ritchie.  Yeah?  For when he visits with the kids, right? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Where's that list?  There was a whole list online.  A list of what?  Things he's allowed to do and not allowed to do?  Yeah.  Kind of, uh, crap?  But there's such...  She's such a just...  A disconnected...  Snot.  Not...  Stan?  The, uh, here's what it says.  If you want me to go over it.  It says, uh, the boys, Rocco and David, who were adopted from, um, Malawi, is that it?  Malawi?  Malawi.  What?  Where?  Malawi.  Ugh. 
[01:23:30]  Two years ago, arrived in, uh, Los Angeles, uh, from LA, met at the airport by their affectionate dad.  Madonna's assistant has emailed Ritchie with a list of do's and don'ts.  The rules include, and this is why I hate her, a ban on TV and DVD watching.  Yes.  Well, you know what?  What, why can't these kids watch any TV or any DVD?  Yeah.  It's like, what a, what a hacky, phony idea about being cultured.  There's a little more to that point, uh, Jimmy. 
[01:24:00]  It says, under no circumstances should they read newspapers, magazines, or be allowed to watch TV or DVDs.  What is wrong with that?  No newspapers, no magazines.  So they get their information from Madonna.  Yeah, she's a completely...  That's good, and she's so in touch.  She's got so many people around her yesing her to death.  Um, she's, she's, she thinks she's obviously a brilliant source of culture and information.  Yes.  It's like, how are these kids supposed to make right and wrong decisions if they're not weighing  options by reading the papers and watching TV?  Mm-hmm.  I hate to tell you, TV's not all bad. 
[01:24:30]  It's not.  It's really not.  A lot of it sucks.  Yeah.  It's not all bad.  Neither are all, these kids can't just watch fun shows and fun DVDs.  She sucks.  What a hypocrite, too, because she's a pop culture icon.  Yeah.  But don't let, don't let no kids get into some of that pop culture stuff.  Stop touring.  What made you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hundreds of millions of dollars.  MTV made her.  Right.  Because kids are allowed to watch TV and watch DVDs and read magazines. 
[01:25:00]  You know.  Total, total fraud.  I think I got a better list that's in the paper.  It's a little more involved.  Okay.  I'm going to go with this for you, Jimmy.  They must adhere at all times to macro, macro, macrobiotic.  Yeah.  Okay.  Macrobiotic, vegetarian, organic diet with no processed or refined food.  Right.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's how that is in the real world.  Everybody eats like that all the time.  Good.  It's almost impossible to eat healthy.  Yeah.  Got to be in the kitchen, have a big back once in a while and just be a kid.  I try to eat healthy. 
[01:25:30]  It's almost impossible.  Wherever you go.  It's hard to find healthy choices.  But she takes it to a whole other level.  Because she's a disconnected snot.  Macrobiotic thing.  All water they drink, even when it is to dilute organic juice, should be Kabbalah water.  Which is mountain spring water blessed by leaders of the Kabbalah religion she follows.  What is that?  She just sucks.  What is it? 
[01:26:00]  Who knows?  Kabbalah water?  Bless the water?  She can't be so close-minded.  I mean, this is going to really have an effect on your kids when they get older.  They're going to be so disconnected.  Because it makes Jimmy laugh.  I love Jimmy's laugh, so we'll do this again.  All water they drink, even when it's to dilute organic juice, should be Kabbalah water.  It's like, how about letting them get a Big Mac once in a while or a cheeseburger and then have McDonald's farts all night?  It's like, why don't you just let them be kids? 
[01:26:30]  I hate her.  It's called a cheat day.  The Macrobionic and Kabbalah.  The Kabbalah guy blessed the water.  The Kabbalah guy is here.  Turn the TVs off.  I bet you it's Ted Kabbalah that blessed the water.  The spring water.  But they didn't even sneeze, Madge.  Madge.  What is with the Madge thing, too?  How does English come up with that crap?  Just unsexual.  Jacko.  They come up with wacko jacko, you know. 
[01:27:00]  Right?  Bless the Kabbalah water.  My anxiety is on macrobiotic.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  There's only teeny biotics?  I have a feeling Stump Brain might know a little bit about this macrobiotic.  I'm sure it's healthier, but give them some chips.  You know what?  A space trucker might be on to something.  I don't have time to go to your call, but he writes, she doesn't want them to find out about her past, probably.  That's a good point.  She's done some crazy things.  Maybe until they get older and they can understand it a little bit more. 
[01:27:30]  She doesn't want them to see Mommy parading around like a hooker on stage with her big fake cone breasts.  With her stupid book where she's hitchhiking naked with a giant brillo pad in her lap.  Didn't want to see that?  It was the fashion.  Was it?  Ever?  No DVDs.  How did the movie do it with Sean Penn?  Let's watch that.  You can't take away from how hot she was, you know.  She was great.  Years ago.  Hey, get back to that list.  Yes, there's Stump Brain.  Yeah, I got a little macrobiotics. 
[01:28:00]  It's basically unprocessed foods, like a lot of grains, a lot of seaweed, vegetables, soy.  How unfun is their life?  Unfun stuff.  We have, Jimmy and I live in the same neighborhood.  We have a supermarket that has some of this organic stuff.  And man, there's something to be said about pumping this crap with steroids, man.  Yes.  Yeah.  You look at some of these vegetables and fruits that are organic and they're just not developed properly.  No.  They don't have good muscle tone. 
[01:28:30]  I like a nice...  You give me a...  I don't typically eat veal.  Right.  Because I don't like the way that the veals are treated, that they're not encouraged to run around and just be fun little veals.  Our salad is fantastic.  It is delish.  Oh.  A little brown sauce right at it, huh?  Oh, it's so goddamn good.  No, it should be done humanely.  Like, if you want a tender thing, what you do is you have a cow and then you call it over.  And when it comes, you just punch its hindquarters to soften it up.  Whack. 
[01:29:00]  Big dope.  Cows are dopes.  You also have to eat things based on the time of the year.  In winter, you have to have round vegetables, pickles, root vegetables, miso, and then heavier grains.  It's great.  Every season has food requests.  And then read books that Madonna's written.  What a fun life these kids have.  Go back to your home country where at least there's civil unrest and dirt eating.  Well, the sex book, she did have that.  Yeah, I know.  Organic fruits and vegetables look like a sick kid.  Terrible.  Just a sick kid. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, just a little off in color.  They're scrawny.  The tomatoes look like they have runny noses.  Yeah.  They look sad.  Like, I don't want to eat sad vegetables and fruits.  I want vibrant colors and something that looks like you put steroids.  Yeah, and radiation and all that other good stuff that makes things good.  Pesticides.  I want some DDT.  I want a ruby red apple.  I want an apple I can bowl with.  A crispy, loud, obnoxious apple.  I want a piggish apple. 
[01:30:00]  It should scream at me from the shelf, hey, I'm an apple.  Right.  I want a fruit or a vegetable that looks like it's spent too much time out in the sun.  Looks like it's close to having skin cancer.  Organic fruit looks creepy.  Check it out for yourself.  A lot of these supermarkets are carrying it now, and they just look sad.  It's good for you.  It's macrobiotic.  They just look like, you know, they need a little more exercise.  Hey, my orange has jaundice.  Well, that's because it's a natural.  Yeah, well, give me the fake coloring.  Yeah, oranges have, like, more of a yellow color. 
[01:30:30]  The organic oranges.  Yeah.  Yeah, just come on.  I don't care if you paint the fruit to make it look better.  I want a banana that looks like a...  That's blood paint.  I don't give a crap.  I don't care either.  I want it to look delicious.  I want a banana that looks like a retard penis.  Let's get back to this Madonna list.  Things that she demands Guy Ritchie does if he's going to be hanging with the kids.  They should wear the clothes Madonna has sent with them on the flight. 
[01:31:00]  If they need to be bought anything, they should not contain man-made fibers.  Right.  No man-made...  Where does she shop?  In the belt around Saturn?  She's...  What's wrong with...  They're wearing moon dirt hats.  Excuse me.  Where's my sediment shirt?  I have an event to go to.  She's just an idiot.  Poor kids are wearing stuff that insects are trying to nest in. 
[01:31:30]  Just like...  Trying to make cocoons.  Where's my seaweed scarf?  Right.  Mother!  Can I have my apple chips?  This is just dumb.  Oh, she's such an out-of-touch boob.  Yes.  Boob.  You want the next one?  Yes.  Their hands should be regularly cleaned with disinfectant spray if they are in public places.  Good.  That's good.  Make them germ freaks, Madge.  That's good. 
[01:32:00]  Good.  Make them germ freaks.  Like, the self-obsession that you obviously have put on them.  Constantly Purelling.  Yes.  Isn't it healthy to get the flu every once in a while?  Of course it is.  Professor Ant.  You have to build up immunity to certain things.  Yeah.  And if you're kept away from those things, it's bad.  And if you Purell all the time, it's very bad.  Because you have bacteria that's good bacteria on you.  And it kills that, too. 
[01:32:30]  The fact that she has to have an assistant email this guy, who's a man, and her husband,  to have the children's hands washed.  It's like, he should just write her back a horrible email.  Yeah.  I don't know what that would say.  I would send her pictures with a phone of us at McDonald's.  Absolutely.  No guy, Richie's going to do that.  And just them wearing, like, her wearing, like, Madonna slut clothes from the 80s. 
[01:33:00]  Have her little girl dressed like that in those horrid clothes.  She's sitting, watching pornography on a television.  Mm-hmm.  Just everything to the umpteenth level of what she said not to do.  And then send her two prize trophies, her two attention-getting prize trophies, back to her  so she can further mold these two kids, who instead of letting them have fun with their new life,  into little, uh, whatever, just little models of her. 
[01:33:30]  Disasters.  We've had Guy, Richie, in studio.  He's not putting up with this crap.  I hope not.  Hell no.  He banged her up.  Oh, look at her.  Looking out a you-know-what.  There she is, getting a little whiff and a little taste.  A hiding in her face.  Nice.  Yeah.  That's the old rusty trombone, I do believe.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wow, she's, uh, this is the stuff she doesn't want her kids seeing, that's why.  No, she was a goer.  What?  Look at her.  Back in the day.  Look at that effing body.  See, that's when she was all right. 
[01:34:00]  That's when she was all right.  You gotta give her more than all right, Ant.  No, dude, that's what I mean.  You gotta give it more than all right.  I'm using the all right, like, holy crap, she was hot.  Right.  Now, disaster.  Mm-hmm.  But she's still trying to go around like, uh,  with zero body fat.  In the old days, it always looked like she was trying to hide an Italian mustache, though.  Yeah.  Look at some of the old photos.  You'll understand.  Hey, can we go back to that list? 
[01:34:30]  Here's another one.  Oh.  They should not be bought toys which are spiritually or ethically unsound.  Toy guns.  Oh, toy guns?  Just buy them toy guns.  Yep.  Yeah.  Is that what she's getting at there?  What about the spiritually thing?  Maybe like, uh, sexy Barbie dolls and stuff.  Yes.  Probably, right?  Or something against the couple.  Guys should not discuss the separation with them.  Oh, yeah.  That happens when the couples break up.  Yeah, they don't talk about what a bitch or an ass the, uh, other one is. 
[01:35:00]  They never put the kids in the middle.  Ever, right?  Yeah.  Right, Ant?  You know that one.  Of course.  Never get the kids in the middle.  I never heard what, how much my father was just a complete waste when, uh, when I was  a kid growing up.  My mother never just pounded that in my head.  And when I went out to California, my dad just never told me what a complete waste mom  was.  Yeah.  And what a bitch she was to have to live with.  And thank God he's 3,000 miles away.  I'm surprised he didn't go to Catalina Island to get another couple of miles between the two 
[01:35:30]  of them.  So, Jesus, what did they hate each other?  What team did you end up joining?  I went with Team Dad for a while.  Team Dad for a while?  For the formative years.  I went to Team Dad because, uh, you know, Team Mom thing wasn't working out too well.  Right.  As far as, uh, you know, me just crying constantly.  Uh, perhaps I needed, you know, Dad to smack me around a little bit.  I would think that your mom would, uh, you know, would understand the crying thing.  Uh, no.  Well, she was always busy.  You know, she had to work.  She had to raise three kids. 
[01:36:00]  So, you know, it didn't matter.  She'd just go, oh, shut up or something.  Oh, what's the matter?  She didn't baby me or anything.  I was, you know, baby enough for myself.  But Dad didn't take it.  He's like, you shut the hell up.  I'll give you.  It was like, stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about.  That was his, like, catchphrase.  Now, we've heard about your crying, uh, for a while now.  Oh, I was the biggest cry baby.  All right.  And we know that.  The faithful listeners know that.  Here's the question today.  I don't think you've ever answered this.  When was the last time you cried?  I can't even remember. 
[01:36:30]  Can you think about it?  Have you cried in your adulthood?  Have you cried in the last, let's say, 10 years?  Probably.  I think I had a little private weep session when, uh, like when my father died.  That was pretty much it.  And even that I held off for like 24 hours.  Right.  Because, uh, my ex-wife was around and this.  And I was like, you know, I want a private moment here. 
[01:37:00]  So I waited.  I just waited, you know, and then decided I'd go home and kind of reflect and get emotional.  But that was it.  And then all I did was hear my father go, knock it off.  What are you crying?  You're crying with my dad?  I'm dead, so what?  I'll give you, I'll give me something to die about.  Dad, you're not making sense.  Any movies, Ant?  You said during, uh, in, in, in, in father, when Hitler killed the dog, there was a human moment there.  Oh, that little, uh, well, I wasn't crying, but it was sad when Hitler killed Blondie in, um, in, uh, Downfall. 
[01:37:30]  Fed him the capsule.  Yeah.  Although I watched that just the other day.  I watched that like two days ago.  And, um, and, uh, uh, it wasn't as emotional as the first time when I saw it.  What movies made you cry recently?  That'd be something.  Uh, recently a movie that even got me like maybe like kind of.  Misty.  Lump in my throat-ish.  Uh-huh.  Can't even tell you.  Probably the last one was, like I said, Ghost.  When Demi Moore, that one single tear rolls down the cheek. 
[01:38:00]  That gotcha.  Oh, my love, my darling, I hunger for your time.  And, you know, there's glowing Patrick Swayze and one tear going down and then Whoopi comes  on and drives me up to everywhere.  It really does.  All right.  Back to this list.  Uh, guys should not discuss the separation with them. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  Madonna should have phone contact with the boys as much as three or four times a day.  A day?  Good.  Obsessive.  Don't let them be alone with their father.  Obsess.  At times set by her.  So.  They better be available at 10, 10 a.m., 2, 10 p.m., 8, 10 p.m., what have you.  She sets the time.  Wow.  I hate her.  The boys should not be introduced to guys' new friends, especially any new female friends  he has attracted since the separation.  Mommy. 
[01:39:00]  Have him call her mommy.  Oh, wow.  I met my new mommy today, Madge.  Have him say go home.  Call her Madge.  Say, hey, Madge, I met my new mommy today.  And just watch her head explode, literally.  Everyone's calling you a liar, by the way.  Why?  You cried on election day.  It's obvious.  Oh, okay.  It's obvious.  Well, you know something?  I blocked it out.  Who are you kidding?  I was.  Weeping like a baby.  Almost done with this list.  And by the way, don't introduce her to new girls is the first logical suggestion on 
[01:39:30]  that list, which she probably shouldn't even need to tell him.  Mm-hmm.  Madonna has encouraged the access to give him time with the boys rather than his parents  spending large amounts of time with the boys.  What?  I don't know.  I guess he just, when it's his turn to have the kids, he probably, you know, tells the  parents, his parents, yeah, do something fun with them, I think.  Yeah, they probably have fun with their grandkids and do awful things like watch TV and spoil  them with little cookies.  Right. 
[01:40:00]  You know, these terrible things where if they were still in their home country, they'd have  real culture, like be running around with sticks and swinging at hornet's nest.  Just, I hate this woman.  What a stick in the mud she is.  What a bore.  The boy should not be photographed while with Guy.  It is his responsibility to organize security so that does not happen.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  At bedtime, Guy should read David, the English Rose books Madonna wrote. 
[01:40:30]  What a self-obsessed ass.  I, I, yeah.  The English Rose, she's trying so hard to not be the, to not be the whore she came off  like in the 80s.  The whore.  Sorry, stupid.  That's what we see as hairy pits and a nice rack.  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  He can't get away from those photos, can you, Majeru? 
[01:41:00]  Majeru.  Majeru.  And don't show them any of my whorish past photos where my armpits look like things with  beards if Jim had improv skills.  Let's say hi to Todd in Massachusetts.  Todd.  How's it going, guys?  Pretty good, man.  Hello, Todd.  I love the show.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe how great you guys are.  Jimmy, can't wait to see the book.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  When are you coming to Boston?  I'll be in town Friday at Late Show at the Wilbur Theater, and then Saturday's already  sold out. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, okay.  Well, that takes care of that.  Are you doing signings?  At the Wilbur, I'll be doing them.  God, that's good.  I love this guy.  Thank you, myself.  All right, here's the deal.  Oh, wow.  I almost hit my subconscious, and I backed out because Obama's coming.  I need to paint the picture for Anthony.  You ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay, Obama makes it, first of all, he's going to make it to the second term.  Eight years from now, I don't know how old his daughters are now, but I want you to  picture his daughters having a party upstairs in the White House.  Obama's downstairs in the kitchen getting a glass of, getting a Hennessy, let's say, and 
[01:42:00]  down comes one of her daughter's friends.  What would Obama sound like standing in the kitchen?  Well, hello.  What are you doing here?  Hi.  Aren't you supposed to be with the rest of the girls at the party?  What are you doing?  Oh, my goodness.  What if she walks in?  Oh, yeah.  Todd, you're a fan of that, too, huh?  Oh, no, God.  No, let me tell you the funniest bit I've ever heard in 42 years of life on this God 
[01:42:30]  green earth was the frigging dwarfs in Connecticut.  You guys went to that, the sound, the HBO special for the dwarfs.  Oh, that dwarf, that was, and he was looking for his parents, and the mother chased him  away.  You're not supposed to leave Connecticut.  Yeah, I thought you weren't supposed to leave Connecticut.  Oh, the fun, you did that voice with the little, what did you say, the cocktail frank  fingers?  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now, I was just, I was in my car, just tears streaming down my  face.  I would say when you shake a little midget's hand, a little dwarf's hand, it feels like 
[01:43:00]  you're shaking cocktail franks and a muffin.  It's like a little muffin palm with little cocktail franks coming out of it.  It's awful.  You almost feel like a, when you grab hands with him, like a powdery muffin.  Well, thank you there, Todd.  All right, guys, you're fantastic.  Keep it up.  Make sure you see Norton when he's up there.  You'll get it.  Okay.  We've got to say hi to Angela.  Angela has a problem.  Angela.  Hey, what's up?  Good morning. 
[01:43:30]  Good morning, Angela.  How are you?  Doing good.  I'm good, thank you.  How are you?  Better now that you called, dear.  That's right.  Oh, thanks very much.  I'm a little upset, though.  I heard a commercial on your station today about AshleyMadison.com.  Yes.  Are you familiar with what this is?  Yes, this is a service.  You go to AshleyMadison.com, and what they do is they ask married people on there, men  and women, and you find who's compatible and who's in a similar situation as you, and if  you're not having sex in your marriage, you can then have an affair using Ashley Madison 
[01:44:00]  to find the people instead of having to troll bars and maybe go out and draw suspicion of  your loved one.  Okay.  Understood.  I do have a complaint that this exists at all, but the reason I've called you about it  is that I don't think this commercial should be aired during 7.30 a.m. drive time at all.  Why?  What's the matter?  I may have some ideas about your show and the type of people that are listening to it,  but that's the time the kids are in the car, and I think that's like a late-night 
[01:44:30]  TV slot rather than a 7.30 in the morning radio slot.  Miss, hold on, miss.  How about this, miss?  How about you?  I know it's hard when you're a parent to actually fulfill parental responsibility, but how about  this?  As an adult, you take charge and put on stuff that you want them to.  I don't care when kids are in the car.  Radio Disney.  It's irrelevant.  Radio Disney doesn't have that commercial for Ashley Madison, so.  Well, they certainly don't, but are we going to be realistic?  I think we should be realistic and know that your, you know, 10, 12, 14-year-old is sitting 
[01:45:00]  in the passenger seat next to you, flipping through the radio themselves, and if they just  happen to catch that ad, I do think it shouldn't be on the radio.  Well, you're wrong.  Their slogan is actually, life is short, have an affair.  Not, are you unhappy to find a way out?  I'm glad the advertising's working.  Yes, and how about this?  But if you're unhappy.  If that happens and your kid asks you a question, how about you then be a big parent and explain  that affairs are wrong and that's incorrect if that's how you feel? 
[01:45:30]  How about you do that as a parent instead of expecting everyone else to police and tiptoe  so your kid doesn't hear something inappropriate?  Yep, it's a free country, and anyone can talk about whatever they want.  How about answering the question?  How about answering the question?  Time and a place, I will answer the question.  Yes.  I'm not a parent.  I just, I feel strongly that people with children, I'm not a parent.  Of course you're not.  Sorry?  Who's going to bang you?  You're annoying.  You can't be a parent. 
[01:46:00]  You want to be a parent then.  By the way, affair's guaranteed.  I just have a strong objection to smut.  Are you married?  A strong objection to smut.  Are you married?  God, do you have a computer?  I'm not married.  Oh, God.  It's irrelevant.  Do you have a computer?  Do you have a computer?  I do have a computer.  Do you know most kids use computer and see things far worse and hear things far worse  on a computer than they would a commercial?  I just want to know if WBCN promotes this service.  I assume you do because you're advertising. 
[01:46:30]  Let me tell you what they do.  They accept money from a sponsor that is willing to pay money to be on the station and be advertised  in that fashion.  In other words, WBCN takes no moral stance on this issue.  No, I'm sure they're not taking...  In fact, by accepting money and promoting it, you're actually promoting this issue.  They're not promoting child porn from Denmark or somewhere.  That's completely irrelevant.  No, no.  What I'm saying is there is a moral line that they take, but there are certain products that 
[01:47:00]  aren't for everybody.  Yes.  And it's not smut.  If you're happily married and have a great sex life, you don't need AshleyMadison.com.  But what they're doing is if you do need that service, they're advertising to people that  apparently need it.  And it's done in a way where...  What is smutty about it?  I think what's smutty about it is life is short, have an affair.  Okay.  And the fact that few people post photos. 
[01:47:30]  I researched this after hearing about it because I was a little bit.  Of course you did, big girl.  Of course you did.  How turned on did you get?  Did you get a little turned on at the thought of it?  It's a little dirty, right?  Not really.  A little moisture buildup?  What came to my mind, what came to my mind is the unsuspecting spouse who thinks that  he or she is in a committed relationship.  Well, then have some sex.  Or who means they're sharing germs with anyone this person needs to betray them with.  Wait, what should...  Sweetheart, can I ask you a question?  This is why I want to tell you why I think you're a liar.  And what I mean by a liar...  Yes, this is why. 
[01:48:00]  I don't mean that you're lying about your opinion, but that you're everything that is  wrong with freedoms in the sense that you don't like something.  So you're trying to create reasons as to why other people shouldn't enjoy it.  With mentioning kids and mentioning, do they support this morally?  You're doing all of these things to get around the fact that if you don't like it, other people  shouldn't hear it.  And that's all this boils down to.  So be honest.  Let me finish. 
[01:48:30]  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  We let you finish.  You let me finish.  It's a free market society.  Some products are for some.  BCN is absolutely right.  I happen to be a recovering alcoholic.  I can't drink.  But should BCN not accept money from Budweiser or another legitimate product?  You don't like it.  So therefore...  Okay, go ahead.  You just keep interrupting.  If you wonder why...  I'm sorry.  You're a prude.  You keep talking.  Yes, I do.  It's a radio show, and I'm on the radio show.  You called in. 
[01:49:00]  You didn't like something.  You're a prude.  We heard your opinions, and now we're giving them back to you.  You don't like something, so you don't want other people...  I'm not a prude, and I don't believe in censorship.  Yes, you do.  There are certain statutes in this country.  We don't sell alcohol before a certain time of day since we brought up the issue.  Yes, we do.  Yes, we do.  Yeah, we do.  Shh.  Yes, we do, sweetie.  Yes, we do.  I'm in Boston, and you certainly cannot...  Oh, that place stunk for buying booze.  You're right.  I hated Boston.  Maybe the blue laws...  You know, maybe we shouldn't play your show in Boston, then. 
[01:49:30]  You'd probably love that.  You would love that.  You would love that because it's probably something you don't like, and when you don't like something,  you're one of those self-will-imposing people that doesn't want others to enjoy it.  You're everything despicable about freedoms.  How do you find out about our show?  It doesn't sound like you actually listen to the show.  So, someone turned you on to the naughtiness that's going on on BCN, and now you're checking  it out and investigating it.  Dirty girl.  Yeah.  I would say that's fair.  That's perfectly fair.  So, who turned you on to the dirtiness of our show?  Where's this coming from?  This wasn't about your show. 
[01:50:00]  Is there a little movement going on?  That's airing this ad.  Answer Ope's question.  BCN 104.1 in Boston is airing this ad at 7.30 in the morning.  Yes, they are.  I think there's a time and a place for everything.  Well, you think that?  And it's not 7.30 in the morning.  Yes.  Well, then, why should you be the arbiter of what the time and place appropriate for certain  product legal advertising is?  How dare you?  It's common sense to me.  It's common sense.  If you don't play something, I think it is. 
[01:50:30]  Angela, you do know you're going to make this AshleyBastit.com huge, right?  You're going to make it even bigger and better than it is right now.  Advertising is good advertising, but I also have read reviews about it just in my research  this morning.  Did some research, huh?  Most of it's out of curiosity now.  Most people are just looking at it out of curiosity.  It also blatantly says that they actually make fake profiles so that you'll be interested  and they'll charge you money.  It's a scam.  Why do you care?  A large part of this says it's a scam.  Do one of your parents cheat on the other? 
[01:51:00]  No.  Why do you care?  Why do you care so much?  Like, why wouldn't you just...  Why do I care?  Yes.  Why do you care?  You're not a parent.  Why do you care?  Because I believe in American morality and...  There you go.  Your morality.  There you go.  Your morality.  It's your morality.  It's your morality.  Not everybody has to agree with me.  It's your morality.  Just be honest with you.  That you're not trying to put on it.  That you're not trying to put on it.  That you're not trying to put on it.  With too much information.  You sit down to watch television and there's an ad about, I don't know, impotence or something. 
[01:51:30]  Just...  I don't want to hear that.  There you go.  You don't want to hear it.  So, sweetheart, be a big girl and turn something else on.  Stop thinking for others.  Think for Angela.  Be a big girl.  And live your life.  You're 25? 
[01:52:00]  What a big child.  You're thinking like an old bitch of this century.  I think you're wrong.  I think that the example of our current president is a perfect example of how we've elected someone with morals because we want morals.  Holy Christ, you don't know this guy from a hole in the wall.  He cavorted with terrorists.  I have both his books and I think I have a good understanding of what he's doing for.  Oh, really?  So, did you get all the parts where you didn't like white people?  Did you get to those parts in the book? 
[01:52:30]  I don't want to have a good understanding of the books at all.  Did you get to the parts where you had the resentment for white people?  Did you sense that in his books?  I think that's a fair opinion to have as a black person in this country.  And I think his honesty and willingness to discuss issues that no one else discusses are one of the reasons I believe he's a good person.  You are such a liberal-ass college twat.  You may have gotten me pegged.  That may be true.  You are.  You are.  I could see it. 
[01:53:00]  You must be a joy to sleep with.  Are you a virgin?  That's just rude.  No.  It's true.  You're not incredibly rude.  You must be a joy missionary, right?  Straight effing missionary, right?  You ever had a part of a man's body in your mouth and you know what I'm talking about?  Have you?  That's what I'm going to let you go.  Yeah, let me go.  You suck in bed.  God damn, you stink.  Even a bad leg is pretty good, but you suck.  God damn, I bet you're lousy. 
[01:53:30]  Ugh.  I bet it's nothing but spitting the whole time.  Spitting.  Spit, spit, spit.  Too much friction.  Spit, spit, spit.  Oh, God.  That old dried up well at 25.  Holy Christ.  My mouth is dry.  I can't even work this anymore.  She's the worst pizza in town.  You are horrid.  She's just...  She's probably...  She's probably ugly.  I don't know what she looks like, but she's probably a homely girl.  Fat!  That had fat written all over it. 
[01:54:00]  Fat college pig bitch.  Don't let her bug you.  She's just a nobody.  Oh, she just...  Ugh.  She's an uptight nobody.  Oh, enough of you.  You slob.  You prude slob is what you are.  She's awful.  This is where I end the conversation with you.  Why?  You never put one in your mouth, did you?  Did you?  Well, when I was younger, Ant, I mean...  Ah, well, we all know about that.  Even Jimmy did.  All those hormones were confusing, right, Jimmy?  Well, she's...  You know, I'm glad you had her pegged as I go. 
[01:54:30]  She's a typical thought police liberal.  Yeah.  I don't like something, so I don't want it heard.  And then she's got to tie it into Obama and the wave of morality that's going to come  over the...  Silly.  Stop.  We're just out of a presidency where the guy was...  We're just getting out of it.  We was a religious zealot.  I think we're going to get less moral, right?  This goddamn morality on everybody, and now you're getting this free-thinking guy in there?  What do you think?  It's going to get worse?  What's worse?  Having George Bush in there or having Obama in there?  You think this is going to be an open, free thing, or it's going to be like Angela is going 
[01:55:00]  to be one of these people who are now going to get what she wants?  Everyone's going to be moral.  Trying to put her morality on everybody.  25.  What happened to her that by 25 she's like this?  Who touched you?  Pat from Winocki.  He's got a great line.  Don't mistake it with OscarMadison.com.  They're all a bunch of slobs there.  Oscar Madison. 
[01:55:30]  You go to OscarMadison.com.  Oh, I want that URL.  I want OscarMadison.com and just a bunch of fat slobs.  It is amazing that people really think that way.  I guess I'm so not into policing the way other people think.  I'm so not.  I can't connect to ever policing other people's thoughts.  It's amazing.  Listen to what you want.  She was upset at the AshleyMadison.com spot.  Who cares?  It's not even graphic.  It's not a graphically sexual spot. 
[01:56:00]  I don't like smut.  Smut.  You should be more upset about the economy and what the hell's going on with all of us.  Yeah.  How about that?  There's bigger issues than a dumb cheating website.  That problem.  It's not a dumb cheating website.  It's fantastic.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Jesus Christ.  Just a nation of thought policing.  Sponsor, shut up.  Thought policing babies.  It's nay on the Oopid stay.  I don't like it.  You know what Ashley Madison must love? 
[01:56:30]  She knows that slug line.  You bet she does.  She knows that slug line.  She was turned on to it by somebody else.  She didn't come across that on her own.  No.  Something's going on out there.  I'm sure we'll hear about it soon.  Just the cheat and investigate, it's almost like if something doesn't interest me, I have  nothing to do with it.  In minutes, I forget about it.  I don't care for that.  I think people have lost that ability just to make their own decisions up and let everybody  else do the same.  And if you're going to protest an advertiser who's not with me, Saved by Zero. 
[01:57:00]  Get that off.  Now that I want off.  That's right.  We could start a petition to get that removed.  I didn't hear it.  Saved by Zero.  Toyota's commercial, and they play Fixes, Saved by Zero.  And the Fixed Dude is even mad.  Yeah, the Fixed Dude.  And no one has talked about the Fixed Dude in over 20 years, and he's mad.  Toyota commercials.  They just shove that, Saved by Zero, down your throat.  And I listened to the original song last night, because I hate that commercial so much,  I did a little research.  Yeah, yeah.  And I listened to the actual song, and it isn't a bad song for the time, but for some reason, 
[01:57:30]  the way they redid it for the commercial, the vocal line hits this annoying note that  isn't in the song, that blasts right through me.  It shocks on a blackboard.  Is it someone else singing the song?  Yeah.  And the Fixed Dude was like, you know, I would have liked it if they would have asked me to  sing it.  Yeah, all right.  It's like, well.  This is the original.  I can tell the difference. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  I used to like Red Skies at Night myself.  Red Skies at Night!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And then there was the other song they did.  The, you know, the one about, yeah, that one.  Yeah.  That one that had a real 80s sound to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the video was, this is Red Skies.  Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, Red Skies, Skies, Skies, Skies, Skies. 
[01:58:30]  They had a lot of hits.  It was the other one, the, uh.  One thing leads to another.  What?  One thing leads to another.  Yeah, but the bit was, I, yeah.  They didn't have another one.  But they did, I guess.  I guess.  Red Skies at Night!  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Red Skies at Night!  All right, we got to take a break.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I like my iPod. 
[01:59:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Let's go to Boston.  What's up, Marie?  Hey, good morning.  How are you?  Pretty good, Marie.  I can barely hear you.  I'm going to try harder.  All right.  All right, Marie.  How are you today?  That'll work out.  Good, thank you.  All right.  I got to tell you, I'm from the Boston area, too.  And as a single woman, when I saw the news report saying you guys were promoting this,  it didn't bother me at all. 
[01:59:30]  In fact, I had the totally opposite reaction.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Is there a news report?  Yeah, it's on the local morning news that you and another radio station in town are putting  these commercials on air and that just as an FYI, there's an old blue law still on the  books in Boston and adultery is still technically a crime.  Oh, so that's why.  That's probably why people are getting all in and up for it.  But of course, it has not been enforced in decades. 
[02:00:00]  Right.  Of course.  But my reaction to it was, as a single woman who's tried the online dating thing, I don't  support adultery.  I put in any profile I've ever written, no married men, no couples, thank you very much,  just not my bag.  And I can't tell you, well, I could tell you at least two or three times, ended up chatting  and meeting people, guys who are married and lied about it.  So I would rather see a site where if you're going to do it, at least do it honestly. 
[02:00:30]  Don't go on there, don't put profiles saying you're single and, you know, and lie to me.  Well, you've got to be honest here.  The whole site is based on lying to somebody.  You know, I mean...  Well, I mean, it's lying to your spouse, obviously.  It's the easiest way.  There are people out there that are married do cheat.  This isn't something that is enticing somebody in a happy marriage to go and cheat. 
[02:01:00]  But if people are cheating, why not go to some place that, you know, it's easier to find  somebody that's maybe in the same situation.  You get a little more background on them.  You're not getting a hooker.  You're not, you know...  I'm totally with you.  And as a single woman, you know, it keeps them, hopefully it will attract them to  other like-minded people instead of putting up even...  I mean, I guess it's once a liar, why not twice a liar? 
[02:01:30]  But, you know, hopefully that'll maybe flush out or flush out some of those people that  are...  Keep them out of your hair.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly right.  All right, Maria.  I want to give a few other people a chance because we're kind of in a speed round right  now.  We go to Chris in New York.  Chris, what's going on?  How are you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  What these people are saying, especially Angela over there, with them advertising this  website, I think women are just...  If they weren't so snobby and they actually took care of the men, okay, I think that they 
[02:02:00]  would try to put it into words that I could say on the line.  Let's say hi to Paul.  Paul.  Yeah.  Hey there, Paul.  No, Uncle Paul.  No, no.  We got Paul on the line.  Hi, Ashley.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, look.  I'm a married man, and I actually agree with your caller, Angela, that you guys shouldn't  be playing those ads during drive time, but just for a different reason.  Yeah.  You know, it's not because I have my kids in the car. 
[02:02:30]  It's because I have my freaking wife in the car.  You guys totally caught me.  I mean, she asked me all about it, and now I'm dead.  Because it raises the suspicion right away.  Yeah.  I mean, she didn't even know about it.  She didn't know about it.  I drove her one day, and now I'm screwed.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  Thank you.  Let's go to Amanda in New York.  Amanda.  Hi there.  Hi.  How's it going?  Good.  Good.  I was just calling about Angela.  She kind of kicked me off.  First of all, I know a lot of listeners in Boston who absolutely adore you guys. 
[02:03:00]  Thank you.  Yes.  For her to even, like, say, oh, maybe we shouldn't listen to you.  She's just being absolutely ridiculous.  Preposterous.  Hey.  Preposterous.  Did Ashley Madison make the front page of the Boston Herald today?  I'm looking at the front page.  It looks like they made the front page.  It says, company vows to help you love, honor, and cheat.  Front page.  Really?  Oh, God.  Way to go, Ashley Madison.  But didn't we at one point say we would look at the papers for all these? 
[02:03:30]  Look at the papers.  Look at the papers.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's, where do you want to go here?  God.  Yeah.  Screw contracts.  We're sticking with this for a little while.  Then we'll leave when we're ready.  Oh, boy.  Look at the phones.  We hit on something we got to talk about.  Frank in Jersey.  How are you?  Hey, good.  Can you hear me?  Yes, Frank.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Jimmy, Anthony.  Dude, you guys got owned by that 25-year-old chick. 
[02:04:00]  Two guys who speak professionally for a living.  And, dude, all she was was a perfect example.  And, you know, I should preface this by saying I'm a huge fan of both of you.  But, dude, that caller was awesome because she was just an example of a chick that neither  one of you could ever get.  She was intelligent and spoke her mind well.  And all you could resort to was twat jokes and you'd be laughing in the background.  I was laughing because it was funny.  And to think I couldn't get a girl, it's just silly, dude.  Do you think?  Wow.  Your psychology is wrong.  Your psychology is wrong. 
[02:04:30]  Do you think that before we resorted to that, we weren't making a good argument about the  fact that she was trying to impose her morality on everybody because she didn't agree with it?  Did you hear that part before we started the name-calling thing that we do, you know,  to get a few laughs?  Absolutely.  But you've got to remember, you know, you're saying that her morality isn't the American  morality.  It's not.  It's not.  But, listen, the American morality, well, the population, it's a bunch of individuals. 
[02:05:00]  So, you know what?  Does it actually aggregate up to the country's, you know, consciousness?  We're not a collective.  We're not the Borg.  We're not a collective.  So her opinion is her opinion.  But there are ways that she can filter out what she's hearing without everybody else  having to not hear the stuff she doesn't like either.  You know what?  She could have turned it off.  She, uh...  I totally agree.  All I'm saying is, I think both is, look, man, nine times out of ten, you blow callers  away. 
[02:05:30]  She stood her ground.  She did a good job.  Oh, stop trying to get her.  You're wrong, dude.  You're 100% wrong.  I kind of agree with Frank.  I think you guys...  Oh, Frank's a goose.  Oh, clam up.  Hey, Opie...  Oh, Frank, shut up, you homosexual.  Oh, hold on.  I think Frank...  I'm just resorting to name calling.  I think Frank makes a good point.  Yes.  Opie, you know what?  And you showed why you're the only one getting married out of the group, because you had  the right mind to keep your mouth shut.  Because that's...  Oh, Frank.  That was a...  That was a...  He better learn how to do that a lot. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, Frank.  That's right.  I'm married.  You can't talk.  I'm a ball and chain.  You see, Frank...  Oh, come on, Frank.  What you're blowing over is the fact that...  My wife snuck.  Frank.  Shut up, Frank.  The bottom line is this.  Oh.  She called up with a silly point.  You went there.  We talked about the responsibility of parenting.  Talked about all that stuff.  As far as changing her ground, you're never going to change other people's opinion.  That's not what it's about.  Standing your ground and being an ass is not winning an argument. 
[02:06:30]  And then we talked about why shouldn't we be able...  It's a perfectly legal product.  I mentioned being a recovery alcoholic.  Should they not advertise alcohol?  Every point was made.  And then she started lapsing into, well, I don't like smart and this and that.  And I knew we were dealing with.  And it was irritating.  So I actually started smashing right and left.  So your point is idiotic.  It was a perfect phone call.  It was a very good debate.  Got people to react to the radio show.  And then you throw in some fun twat jokes.  I mean, come on.  Where else are you going with your radio shows out there?  Yes.  You get it all here.  Oh, go screw Frank. 
[02:07:00]  Kendra, Boston, how are you?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  I just wanted to share my opinion about Angela.  And the fact that I think that she's pretty much pathetic, any guy that she finds is going  to be pretty pathetic.  And I pity her kids, if they ever have any.  I pity the poor kids.  That's what's wrong with America nowadays.  Nobody teaches their kids about sex or don't play with guns or winning and losing and things  like that.  Be parents.  Grow up. 
[02:07:30]  Take charge.  Quit relying on you guys to be the parents.  That's not what you get paid for.  Yeah.  No, actually, we don't.  That and I think she needs a night with Jimmy to loosen her up a little.  Wow.  I tell you something about that dirty girl.  I guarantee you she would respond well to a good spanking.  I guarantee you.  Oh, come on, Jimmy.  Let's show her some fun.  She would respond well to a good spanking.  She needs a good one.  And a ball gag.  Yeah.  Back her thighs slapped.  It makes a good point.  We sacrifice a lot of adult entertainment to protect the kids and it's unfortunate.  It really is. 
[02:08:00]  You know what?  I love you guys to death, but you're never on when my kids are in the car.  You know, I listen to you on XM if I can when my kids are in the car.  I change the station.  The minute they're out, you're right back on.  You're showing responsibility.  That's crazy.  Why would you do that?  It's called being a parent.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm so on the edge.  You know what Angela needs?  She needs to be with her head leaning over the bed a little bit and then slowly walk up  and then just, like, with almost a hula hoop movement, smack her in the face. 
[02:08:30]  Chrissy, New Jersey.  Whack.  Whack.  Yeah.  I think Angela is a total tool and needs to learn how to suck the chrome off a tailpipe  to truly get what she needs out of this world.  And I don't believe in Astrid Madison and what it offers, but I don't go there.  Exactly.  She doesn't talk about it all day long every day.  But Angela's problem isn't that she's a prude.  Angela's problem is that she doesn't like something and doesn't want other people to  be exposed to it.  That's why I hate Angela. 
[02:09:00]  So for Frank, who thought she stood her ground, Frank, that's the point I'm making.  All right.  She sucks.  Yeah, and you're absolutely right.  And you were amazing at the Dress Factory, Jimmy.  Love you.  Thank you very much.  I could have just said he's amazing.  Yeah.  No matter where.  I know.  Like, I'm like, I'm not amazing.  The place is stupid.  Come on.  Shut up.  You dummy.  And I would just mad for no reason.  And then he said you resorted.  Certain jokes, and I was laughing in the background.  Yeah.  Well, sorry, Frank.  I should boo and boo.  I'm sure that'll be coming soon. 
[02:09:30]  Don't worry.  We're not scared to show that.  We like third grade humor.  Yes.  And third grade students.  Oh, Uncle Anthony.  I like this guy.  Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Ben in New York.  We're wrapping up here.  What's up, Ben?  Ben.  Dude.  He writes, guys are nice to women, but he was too scared to say it to our face, I guess.  Very nice to women.  I love girls.  They're the best. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, very nice to them.  Smell nice.  You want to take one more?  We have a huge audience in Boston.  I guess this is getting a lot of attention today.  So people are tuning in the show.  That's nice.  Nicole, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Jimmy, I love you.  Thank you.  I love you, Jimmy.  I have to say that.  Thank you.  But I'm from Boston, and I was listening.  I couldn't believe what she was saying.  What people do is what people do.  You know, I listen to it every morning, and I like it.  And, you know, I'm not going around, you know, being a degenerate, but, you know, what 
[02:10:30]  people do is what they do, and it's their business.  So I'm going to go home, watch some porn, and drink a few drinks, find the website,  and have a good time.  Punching out.  Bye.  Wow.  I don't have a problem with Ashley Madison.  I don't necessarily agree with it.  Like, all right, isn't it great?  Hey, here's what's eventually going to happen.  The companies won't take their advertising anymore because there's too much heat.  Or some jealous husband is going to sue them, or there's going to be a violent episode  associated with it because some guys are going to find out his wife's been getting 
[02:11:00]  banged.  Oh, oh, I hope the third one.  But you know what I mean?  Fun.  And it's going to get blamed on the site.  Let's say a husband finds out some guy's banging his wife.  And decides to do something extraordinarily violent to the guy banging his wife.  If I owned Ashley Madison.com, I would advertise a lot more now.  Yeah.  Now push.  Push forward.  Push forward.  Perhaps somebody is on cleanup duty.  Clean up duty.  One husband finds out you're banging his wife. 
[02:11:30]  He takes Madison with his own hands on something violent.  Yes.  Then the family of the victim, who is banging a married woman, is going to sue Ashley Madison  for introducing.  That's what's going to wind up happening.  Well, everything is, you know, you're able to sue for anything.  Yeah.  We'll see.  I think it's people, you know, going around, seeing if they could hook up with other people,  like-minded people.  Sure.  You got to get out of here because, like, there's new rules.  They get upset when we go past nine.  Rules.  Every phone is lit. 
[02:12:00]  We could easily do another 20 minutes for the fine people out there.  But I think this is a good way to end.  Mike, we'll sum this whole thing up.  Mike.  Mike.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Good show today.  Yo, Frank's a call in hole.  And you guys fucking nailed it.  Oh, sorry.  With Angela.  You guys nailed it with Angela.  That's exactly what makes you go to whatever the hell that website is.  Wow.  I had confidence.  Mike, we were ending the show with you. 
[02:12:30]  He was a little nervous, I think.  Angela's the type of girl that makes you go to AshleyMadison.com.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's the type of girl that makes you go.  You know what?  Right.  I need a little something-something.  All right.  Jimmy, real fast, because we've got to get out of here.  I know you're doing a signing tonight, right?  Yes, sir.  Tonight, Barnes & Noble, my first Staten Island event in the year, 7 p.m.  It's on Richmond Avenue.  I'll be signing.  I hate your guts.  And tomorrow, Borders and Providence Place in Providence, Rhode Island, on my way up  to Boston.  It's at 6 p.m. tomorrow, 7 p.m. tonight in Staten Island. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  We'll continue with this after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  We continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my.  I got to tell you.  What?  What, Jimmy?  I was ready to start something.  What happened?  I bet I know.  What happened?  The iPhone?  Two fucking emails I'm trying to read, and I'm kicked offline twice.  Oh, boy.  That doesn't happen with the BlackBerry.  And those people that have come up to me and said, you didn't buy iPhones because you  heard me rant about it?  Mm-hmm.  Good.  Good.  Yeah, but the BlackBerry is a much better phone.  I'm sure. 
[02:13:30]  I just want to say this on the heels of that, Jim.  The iPhone overtaking the Razor as the best-selling phone ever.  That dumb Razor.  Dude, without a doubt, I'm not going to say anything that's going to really hurt the  iPhone.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want teasing with you.  But, hey, if fucking 50 people don't, good.  Hey.  Yeah.  It fucking enrages me how shitty this thing is.  I understand.  Safari sucks.  Fucking sucks.  You know what's weird?  I have a BlackBerry, and I don't yell and scream like Jimmy does, and it's saying today  that the BlackBerry has twice the failure rate of the iPhone. 
[02:14:00]  Look at that.  I got the chart and everything.  That's because of, um...  What's the failure thing all about, eh?  Well, you know what it is?  People who have it.  Well, like what?  Failed call?  What are you using your BlackBerry for besides sending email and taking a phone call?  Lots of email, lots of pictures for Opie's eye.  I have pictures, cameras.  Because unlike the dumb iPhone, I could just send the picture in a nice, like, uh...  Of course you can.  ...attachment or email.  Right to the person.  I can send it in an email. 
[02:14:30]  I just can't text photos, which annoys me.  I could do that.  That's great.  Now, uh, but emails, though, I could send a photo to somebody.  I could send you one right now.  The thing is, people are using iPhones for a lot more than they're using their BlackBerrys  for.  BlackBerrys are business-oriented.  A lot of people use it.  It's like the difference between a Windows computer and a Mac computer.  A lot of Windows-based computers are in corporate settings.  Mac is very artistic.  A lot of musicians use it, and video people, artists.  It's the same kind of thing. 
[02:15:00]  The iPhone is a lot of fucking things in one unit, so you're going to get some bugs in  there.  The thing with the dropped phone calls with Jimmy, I don't fucking understand it.  I do.  AT&T is a piece of garbage provider.  I'll agree with that.  I got AT&T.  I don't get dropped calls.  I've been in situations where it's at no service.  Oh, yeah, that again, Jimmy.  But out and about...  West side of Manhattan, dude.  Oh, it just kicked offline again, by the way.  How?  Why?  I will not get...  I will be right here next to you with the same phone. 
[02:15:30]  Probably one of my apps.  It's probably because, once again, they release apps for it, and they don't give a fuck that  they don't work.  I have three pages of apps.  I'm working on my fourth.  Nice.  Whatever it is, dude.  So it's like...  What is it?  You got a dirty phone, I'm thinking.  No, no, no.  What are you trying to do?  Are you still going through AOL, though?  Every phone.  I just feel like I've been fucking ripped off.  I feel like I've been ripped off by this fucking company.  There's something you're not explaining, because you've been through four or five phones now. 
[02:16:00]  I've never damaged them.  This is the brand new 3G.  That's so weird.  This is my second 3G, because the first one, I did break off the floor.  It's just like websites pop right up on mine.  It doesn't stop.  It keeps kicking me off.  It's not kicking off anything.  My library's up online.  I'm checking out some stuff.  What are you going to that it's kicking you off?  My AOL mail.  AOL mail.  There's probably an AOL fucking problem.  I guarantee you there's some kind of AOL glitch.  No, because it kicks me off other sites, too.  I went to Drudge Report.  It kicks me off the other ones, too. 
[02:16:30]  It's a fucking...  Drudge, I'm on all the time on this.  AOL's garbage at this point.  You're right.  It absolutely is.  Garbage.  It's not...  That's not the issue.  Garbage.  I would just love to figure out what the problem is, so you can enjoy your phone.  I can't enjoy it, because to be honest, I feel like I've been ripped off.  Right.  And too hip for the room, Apple, who I love their computers with the exception of the shit  volume, doesn't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck, or they would not have gone with a terrible service provider.  They're Drudge, and it's right there. 
[02:17:00]  I don't understand what...  Did you reboot?  Everyone says reboot.  About 500 times.  Take the battery out.  No.  You can't take the battery out.  What?  I can on the iPhone.  No, you can't on the iPhone.  I mean, the BlackBerry, I mean.  Yes, because the BlackBerry's not trying to stick a big dick in your ass.  Why can't you take the battery out?  That's weird.  Because they're trying to stick a big dick in your ass.  That's usually a nice reboot.  There's no reason to.  You shut it off.  How about to fucking buy an alternate battery?  A new battery.  You should be able to buy spare batteries.  I need a battery. 
[02:17:30]  Why should you be able to buy a spare battery?  Because they fucking load this with 3G and Wi-Fi, and it destroys the time you're able  to be on the phone.  So they fucking build it again.  Are you using Wi-Fi?  Everyone screams when you go down this road to turn off the Wi-Fi, Jimmy.  And use the 3G.  Turn it off.  Why should I have to, on a fucking brand new phone, turn off one of the features so  the phone does what it's supposed to do?  I don't know.  I do understand that it does eat up a lot more juice, but any time I'm in my car, I plug  it in. 
[02:18:00]  I have a car charger.  So any time I get in the car while I'm driving home, I plug it in.  When I'm home and I go to sleep, it's plugged in, so it's charged for the day.  The next day, you know, you do need a little more discipline as far as charging it goes,  but I am amazed that you have this many problems with it.  I feel bad.  I don't.  If that BlackBerry is anything good, I will go right to it.  I don't have any problems.  I have a lot of money on my fucking iPhones and my fucking bills, and I feel like I've 
[02:18:30]  been fucking ripped off.  Oh.  So you people who have, a lot of you have told me you haven't bought it.  Good.  I've at least gotten my money back.  There you go.  In people that haven't bought it.  Without a fucking doubt.  Yeah, you have.  You have.  Here's the iPhone story for today.  The iPhone becomes the nation's top-selling cell phone.  Nice.  Apple sold nearly 7 million iPhones in the third quarter, catapulting it into the top spot  and ending the Motorola Razr's three-year run at number one.  The growing popularity of devices like the iPhone and BlackBerry is seen as a sign that 
[02:19:00]  consumers want more features on their phones.  Beating out the Razr.  Never, never bought the Razr hype.  No, I wasn't into the Razr thing either.  Didn't buy it.  Where did the Pebble wind up, and where did my StarTac wind up?  The StarTac was a huge phone when it came out.  Can we get a top 10?  I would love a top 10.  Do you have any flip phones ever, ever purchased or whatever, sold?  I would love a top 10 of this.  I was very into Nokia when they first came out, but they didn't have a flip phone, so 
[02:19:30]  I was constantly calling people, because I never liked locking my keyboard, because it  was a pain in the ass.  Sure.  So I was constantly calling people.  I was one of those people that would have the phone in the pocket, and all of a sudden  you'd just hear me walking around.  Do you remember?  Shook, shook, shook.  Do you remember, and it was probably only two years ago, I brought in the Pebble, and everyone  was kind of like, ooh, ah.  Because this was before iPhone and all that.  Yeah.  I didn't like the Pebble, because it didn't have that many features.  I need fucking features.  You need your live TV. 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  You used to have that phone with the live TV, which is nice.  That's the one thing I missed on the iPhone also that they've got to get.  I was getting live television on one of my phones.  It was a little small screen and everything, but it was a lot of fun.  New commercial for the BlackBerry.  Why don't I have this yet?  Look at that thing.  Oh, that's the old one.  That's the old keyboard.  Well, that's the, I know.  Well, the Touch is coming out a little later.  Their Touch version, whatever.  Hey, we'll get back to the cell phone thing.  We've got to find the top ten, you know, cell phones.  Wait a minute, dude. 
[02:20:30]  Sold of all time.  Is that fucking Touch going to be AT&T?  Uh-oh.  The BlackBerry Touch not going to be Verizon?  No.  It's going to be Verizon.  Verizon.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  A little company called AT&T.  My God.  Jesus Christ.  He had a samurai sword.  He was ready to just commit harry-carry.  Thank God.  AT&T is fucking atrocious.  I only have problems with my AT&T phone in my apartment.  It's a big place to have them.  We're in Manhattan.  This is just going to make you even madder.  What?  Laszlo says, tell Jimmy to turn off the Wi-Fi. 
[02:21:00]  That's the problem.  Maybe he's right.  Maybe the Wi-Fi is the problem.  So maybe Steve Jobs should stop with the mock turtlenecks and fucking fix it.  Cunt.  I listened.  I wanted to start the show because it's a very exciting and a very sad day for satellite radio.  Now, I got a bunch of satellite radios.  Don't worry.  I got it under control.  Oh, okay. 
[02:21:30]  But there's a dumb station I like that most people could give a shit about.  It's called Audio Visions.  And I have it in my little...  That's a weirdo station.  It's like when you get a massage.  It's like you're in a spa.  That's for fags.  Or you're meditating or something.  I don't know.  But I have it in one of the rooms in the morning when you get up so goddamn early and I go in  to change and get ready for the day.  You're like...  Oh, yeah.  It's just a nice way to start the day instead of... 
[02:22:00]  And then you move into Metallica eventually.  But that's where I'm at today.  I'm sad that went away.  And people are sad that...  One of my other stations, Ethel.  I loved Ethel.  Ethel's gone, huh?  I guess Ethel's gone and replaced by what?  Lithium?  Mrs. Trumbull.  They're called the station.  Alt Nation.  Alt Nation?  I haven't listened to the Sirius music channels in probably four years.  When they were both courting us, we had a free Sirius and a free XM radio. 
[02:22:30]  And I would go back and forth.  And Sirius music channels four years ago were really good.  They definitely were better than XM at the time.  Yeah.  But now Ethel is bye-bye.  Lucy is bye-bye.  Lucy's gone, too?  I believe so, yeah.  What is Lucy now?  Oh, I don't know what Lucy is, but we listened to that great little outro.  Yeah, that's what I'm leading to.  Yes.  You dummy.  That's what I'm leading to.  Alt Nation's way better than Ethel.  I've been doing this a long time.  It's called I'm Gonna Seg Into Something Fun. 
[02:23:00]  I'm a lithium fan, but that playlist is a little tight.  Oh, really?  No, Nirvana.  It's all Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Green Day, Soundgarden,  Alice in Chains, Green Day, Nirvana, Nirvana, Mudhoney, occasionally.  Kind of like a shampoo direction thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Repeat.  But lithium, probably one of my favorite stations, but they do get a little tedious.  You got to switch it up with something else.  Yeah.  Well, so I guess they got the new channel lineup, and people are not happy. 
[02:23:30]  Here's one.  God, I hope they were smart enough to keep fine-tuning.  What was fine-tuning?  Fine-tuning, I think, was Lee Abrams' invention, and it was kind of like a mixture of classical,  but rock.  So they would play...  I hate to use the example, yes, because that's very...  Yes!  That polarizes people.  Yes!  But how about...  Favorite band?  Yes!  They'll do a little Bach or Mozart, and then they'll get into a deeper track from, let's  say, Van Morrison. 
[02:24:00]  That's insanity!  But they did it in such a way, it was really cool, and it was great for a Sunday morning  when you're just waking up and you're not ready to rock.  You just put it on the background while you're checking your email and drinking coffee and  reading newspapers.  It was very clever and very unique.  I mean, I don't think anyone tried that before.  I would never listen to something like that, but satellite radio, in its inception, was supposed  to be this thing with a lot of niche programming, because it didn't really matter, as long as  they got the subscriber, what they were listening to. 
[02:24:30]  Sure.  We're all one big happy family.  But now it seems like they're just kind of going for what is on regular radio.  They're wiping out a lot of those little niche programs and stations that people kind  of liked.  That's what I liked about satellite radio.  I mean, yeah, can I tune in to Ethel and hear some cool alternative rock without commercials  and without too much babbling?  Yeah.  I love that.  But then I would love to go a little deeper into my unit and check out some of this niche  programming. 
[02:25:00]  And I thought a lot of it was really cool to listen to.  Just don't fucking take away my show tunes, man.  They take away Broadway, my show tunes, and I'm going to throw a little hissy fit.  Like, do we really need that one?  No.  Go to Broadway if you want to hear a fucking show tune.  What was it called?  Off-Broadway or something?  It was called Faggot.  Yeah.  W-F-A-G.  It was called Get That Thing Hard So I Can Sit on Broadway.  On Broadway.  So people are discovering there's a brand new channel lineup, and some people are very psyched, 
[02:25:30]  some people are bummed.  Like, for example, we now get the Grateful Dead channel, I believe.  Oh, good.  All us XMers.  Jesus Christ.  It's the same song for fucking 24 hours.  Gives a shit.  A fucking tuning session.  I hate the Grateful Dead.  Fucking hate them.  Hate people that like the Grateful Dead.  But I like the Grateful Dead.  Never liked it.  Well, Jesus.  Says a lot, I know.  No, you don't.  You know what?  I understand.  If you were a hairy, armpitted, fucking dirty feet girl, that's what I'd fuck you at a Grateful 
[02:26:00]  Dead concert for some spaghetti.  I like the Grateful Dead, but I...  This isn't even like...  This doesn't even qualify.  This is called beginner dead in the dead community.  This is what you hear on the radio as far as dead goes.  And I still turn this shit off, but at least this has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  It's an actual, what they would call a song.  Yeah.  When you'd sit there, and they would fucking jam, and these deadheads are like, this is  the coolest thing.  Look, man, they're jamming. 
[02:26:30]  For three hours, they're gonna jam.  Well...  Who gives a shit?  You enjoy a little pot every once in a while, you should try the dead.  Fuck that.  It's a good combo, my friend.  Nine.  I will not listen.  A couple of hits, and then do a little space and drums.  Oh, space and drums.  What's some of those other Grateful Dead songs we enjoy when we're high?  Patch of Grey.  That's begun.  Touch of Grey is good.  Touch of Grey. 
[02:27:00]  That annoys dead fans.  How many times are they cleaning the windows?  They're cleaning the windows again.  I feel like they're spying on us.  I don't know what the fuck they're doing.  They're actually doing something because there's construction going on in this building.  I think they gotta wipe off the fucking dust.  I got one person that feels my pain.  Aaron in Illinois.  They fucking took off audio vision.  And fine-tuning.  I'm with you.  Those two stations were great just to have kind of in the background when you're doing,  you know, Squiz is gone again.  Remember that?  That was gone, and then it came back from the dead. 
[02:27:30]  Well, that's what I want to talk about.  And they shot it in the head.  There's a lot of confusion.  What?  There's a lot of confusion right now, so come on.  Let's get together and figure this shit out together.  Let's.  We get a Grateful Dead channel.  That makes some people happy.  Makes Anthony and Jimmy very pissed off.  I get it.  Miserable.  We've lost fine-tuning.  We've lost audio visions.  We've lost Ethel.  We've lost Lucy.  Lucy, I believe.  They do have counterparts, but.  Misty water-colored memories.  Hold on.  Do you believe me? 
[02:28:00]  Do you believe me?  This is the next note.  You know what I like about your slide whistle bit? 
[02:28:30]  It's such a dumb little thing, but I got to point it out.  Every time you go for the slide whistle, you're not sure which way it's going to play.  No, I don't know where to start.  How to start.  Anyone else notice that?  Every time.  He goes in the wrong direction.  Okay, it's the other way.  And then he plays it perfectly.  I don't know which way to start. 
[02:29:00]  I love picking up on the obscure dumb shit.  It goes, doodly-doo.  It goes, doodly-doo.  When you're supposed to go, doodly-doo.  But you figure it out like that every time.  My brother Elmo's going to be happy.  I think they got the Jimmy Buffet station now, right?  Oh, wow.  For all you parrot heads.  See now, how you talk about the dead?  Yeah.  If you said that about the Jimmy Buffet thing, I'm with you. 
[02:29:30]  I don't get the Jimmy Buffet thing.  I'm with you, because that's, you know.  Jim?  Yes, Jim.  He's just a nice guy.  Shut the fuck up.  I forgot.  Jonathan's a good friend of his.  Here we go.  Oh, really?  Good old Jonathan, yes.  We had dinner.  He was really nice.  Dug my stuff.  Yeah.  Who did?  With me, Jonathan, Jimmy, and his ratager.  Jimmy Buffet.  Yeah.  You hung out with Jimmy Buffet.  I did him with him, yeah.  That's pretty huge.  And he what?  Likes your stuff?  Jonathan gave him my DVD and stuff, and yeah, he watched it.  Are you going to go down to the Caribbean with him?  Do a little island hopping? 
[02:30:00]  Do you think he hangs out there?  Do you think he's sick of the Caribbean?  He's in Alaska.  How do you get sick of the Caribbean?  Yeah, true.  There's so much goodness down there.  All right, let's go to the phone.  So we're trying to figure this shit out.  It's exciting, but it's also a sad day.  So let's start with Dave the Trucker.  Dave, what can you tell us?  They got rid of the Boneyard, and you said scores already.  Wait, the Boneyard I heard was staying.  It's coming back.  No, they changed it to Hair Nation.  Oh, I like Hair Nation. 
[02:30:30]  I liked it a little better than Boneyard.  No way.  I did when I had both, too.  I liked the Hair Nation a little better than Boneyard.  What's going on, Steve?  No way.  Steve is here.  He would tell us.  Yes, of course.  I thought you said bone hard.  That's what I like to have done.  Yeah, go ahead, Steve.  Boneyard's only gone.  It was Hairy Bone.  Hair Nation.  Much no, boys.  All right.  What do we got on the Boneyard?  It's going away for eight weeks.  It's coming back in January on a different channel, I think, 53.  The ACDC channel? 
[02:31:00]  The Boneyard.  We'll be on the ACDC channel, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  See, this is all easy.  Do you like the Boneyard?  I do, Jim.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Let's go to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Of course.  I have no improv at all.  Jeremy.  I love it.  Yes.  Hey.  Honest dancers.  You really fucked up a lot of these channels here, man.  They took away Squiz, also.  Now, what's with Squiz?  Well, what's the one replacing Squiz?  Because you've got to replace Squiz.  Octane.  Octane.  Octane.  Is Octane good at it? 
[02:31:30]  Octane?  You got the serious unit.  I get a thumbs up from Danny.  Thumbs up on the Octane?  No, I mean, last night I got a thumb up from Danny.  It was great.  He's got a fat little thumbs.  It does.  A fat tongue and a mohair cut.  Hey, they changed the graphic on your channel, too.  About 2 o'clock this morning, there was an off-air message.  I got a little scared.  And then after that, they put on a child on a tricycle with an older gentleman holding  him on his shoulder, which kind of made me wonder.  Yeah, that was the show I was doing.  Uncle Paul. 
[02:32:00]  It was called to teach him to ride.  Well, as long as they don't take you off, I'll keep the radio, I guess, but if they  take your station off, it's gone.  All right.  We all know.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  I defy them.  Octane's good.  From what I recall, I'm more of a fan of the 90s, what's it called now?  Lithium.  The Lithium.  Lithium's good.  Hair Nation, I like.  See, because in my Stang, I only had Sirius. 
[02:32:30]  I didn't have XM, so I listened to a lot of the Sirius things, and I liked the music  better than I liked XM's music.  It's just the way it was.  And I do like Lithium, and Hair Nation was a better, if you want to listen to some hair  band shit, that's the place to go.  I don't think it's as heavy as the Boneyard, though.  The problem with the Boneyard, they got a little too obscure for my taste.  Yeah, they did.  I kind of wanted to hear more of the hits, because you don't hear that type of radio  when you're just tuning around the regular radio crap.  Yeah, XM had been like that since the beginning, with being a little too cool for the room 
[02:33:00]  with some of these fucking channels.  Right.  It's like, all right, I understand it's satellite, and you can get this and that on regular radio,  but you don't have to go so goddamn deep with some of these things.  If I'm listening to the 80s channel or something, I want to hear, like, nostalgia.  I want to hear the hits that I kind of knew of in the 80s.  Sure.  On small doses, you can't sit there all day and listen to it, but I don't want to hear  fucking, you know, Thomas Dolby's fucking deep track.  Yeah, there's three cool, not cool, I shouldn't say that, but three Thomas Dolby's songs that 
[02:33:30]  haven't been played on radio in a long time.  Play those.  Yeah.  One of my submarines is missing.  Stop right there.  Michael, Tennessee, how are you?  Hey.  Good.  Hiya, Mike.  Thanks.  How you doing, Jimmy?  Good, buddy.  The thing I hate about audio visions, they used to play the waves and the birds and stuff  while I slept at night.  I slept better.  I didn't dream all weird, you know what I'm saying?  And they've got, like, Kenny Chesney and ACDC and... 
[02:34:00]  Hell, we got iPods for that shit.  I love Michael, because I do the same thing.  I take my little nap after the show, I throw audio visions on, and there's, like, all this  nature stuff.  It makes the dreams a little nicer.  Yeah, a little bird noises and a little, like, little river, little rivers.  A babbling brook.  A babbling brook, a little tiny little waterfall, not too much, because that shit wakes you up.  Dude, you can buy one of those little sound things for that, though.  Fuck that.  Audio visions does hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  You're right, boys.  All right.  I never understood the 24-hour ACDC channel myself.  I don't either.  And I love ACDC, but, I mean, I understand it for bands like Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Not a huge fan, but I understand you do it with Bruce Springsteen, Jimmy Buffet, I understand,  and The Grateful Dead, I do understand, in my world.  ACDC, I didn't feel like...  Nah, needed a whole thing.  Nah, man.  Did they take away that cinema thing where it was movie music?  I don't know.  Movie music? 
[02:35:00]  That one.  That station.  I did try that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Sucked.  I was like, what the fuck is this?  Like, movie music?  Sucked.  And I'm not talking, like, soundtrack, like, with that.  It was actual, just mood music from movies.  Yeah.  What about Sean and Georgia?  What do you got on this whole thing?  Hey, uh...  Well, they got rid of all the punk rock stations, too, on both Sirius and XM.  That's what they replaced with ACDC radio.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, I know there was a lot of outrage when that first, uh, hit.  What?  You gotta have a punk station. 
[02:35:30]  Do ya?  Do they have a punk station, Travis?  Sort of?  Kind of.  I mean, Fungus was a straight punk station.  Yeah, I know.  Sirius has, uh, Faction, which is punk and hip-hop and, like, something else.  And that's what it's been replaced with.  And that station sucks.  Why does it suck, though?  Because, because there's, there are already hip-hop stations, you know?  Like, why don't you just have a regular punk station?  Is it more hardcore hip-hop stuff that maybe the hip-hop stations wouldn't play?  No, not really. 
[02:36:00]  Oh.  No.  But, like, certain shows on Fungus, like Rancid Radio, is going to, to Faction, but still.  How's, um...  One station.  Yeah, you need a, you need a real punk, uh, station.  Yeah.  I don't know.  M&M's?  Shady.  Iraq has the Sirius.  Iraq.  What channels are we gonna like?  Uh, I, I'm going to the line of now.  Paul Abdul channel?  Exactly.  That would be 90s on 9.  Ah.  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  I, I, I didn't, never liked, uh, XM's version.  I don't know what Sirius's version of the 90s channel is. 
[02:36:30]  It was called The Pulse.  But, XM's version of the 90s was only shit that, like...  It was all pop shit.  Yeah.  It was like, they would play En Vogue, and shit like that.  Dude, uh...  It wasn't 90s.  A better example of that was the 80s channel, uh, channel, because most of us that are a  little older, when you think 80s music, you think all that, like, new wave crap, right?  I want to hear, like, yeah.  But then they throw, all the pop songs were popular in the 80s, and it was like, what?  If I'm thinking 80s, I'm thinking, uh...  Cars.  Yeah, I'm thinking new wave.  Uh... 
[02:37:00]  The Fix, like we were talking about earlier.  The Knack.  The Knack.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The Knack.  Berlin.  Berlin.  That's what I want to hear.  Haircut 100.  Right.  I'll challenge it.  Keep going.  Was not was.  Devo.  In excess.  Wow.  No, that's what I'm thinking.  Uh...  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, yes.  What about big country?  In a big country.  Dream stay with you. 
[02:37:30]  Our house.  Eddie Grant's madness.  In the middle of the...  Eddie Grant.  Men without hats.  That's right.  I prefer old ladies without hats.  Yes, that's my favorite.  I'd like to hear that tune.  Yeah.  Yes.  I can punch you if I want to.  You could leave your hat behind.  Your hat ain't paid for.  And it ain't paid for.  But I'm going to knock you on your old behind. 
[02:38:00]  And, and, and, and.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, what a stupid hair.  Oh, my God.  They got Asian radio now?  What?  This is stuff that anybody can get.  They don't have to pay for it.  If they're an XM.  This is what we need to know. 
[02:38:30]  Like, what the XMers are getting today they didn't get yesterday.  ESPN Extra.  Asian radio.  The power.  I think the power we had, right?  Yeah.  Old time radio we didn't have.  The power!  Yeah, that was there.  Canadian pop.  Canadian pop.  Black station.  The power.  The power.  I don't know.  They still got, of course it is.  Let's say hi to Matt in Buffalo.  Matt, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  What's up, Matt?  Your phone's crackling.  A lot of interference on your cell. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, Matt.  Hold on one second.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  All right, guys.  Anyway, I'm beyond pissed about this whole situation.  Oh, that sounds terrible.  I've been a subscriber to XM for a while.  Yeah.  And I've had you guys when you guys are still on the subscription channel.  And I love Squiz.  I'm beyond pissed.  I got rid of it.  And I'm beyond pissed.  They got rid of you guys on DirecTV.  I used to wake up in the morning, throw that on while you guys were still on live.  You don't wake up anymore.  The Pioneer and I record the show.  And I listen to it the rest of the day.  I can't even fucking listen to you guys on DirecTV. 
[02:39:30]  That DirecTV is really frustrating.  But, you know, we're just whatever's.  Oh, and I got to say, how can you not like the fucking Showtime or the Showtunes channel?  They got the fucking Back to the Future comes on.  They got the fucking sound.  No, no, no, no.  That's the other one.  And that's Cinemagic has all that.  Cinemagic's got that.  On Broadway is all that just horrendous musical crap.  I'd rather just listen to Huey Lewis do the Power of Love.  That gets me into the whole mood of Back to the Future. 
[02:40:00]  It's all I need, my friend.  That's right.  That's all I need.  All right.  Let's go to Matt.  And then that goddamn...  You know what else I just...  Power of Love stinks.  Oh, it's great.  That goddamn Chris Cornell song for the last James Bond movie.  That one really grew on me.  Oh, goddamn.  I'm drawing a blank.  He's just fucking great.  What song?  You Know My Name?  Or...  You Know My Name?  Is that it?  You Know My Name?  I don't know.  You got me.  You know my name?  You know my name?  You know my name?  Was it a big radio hit?  Yeah, you'll recognize it. 
[02:40:30]  Okay.  It's just great.  I kind of like...  His voice is amazing.  You know this one, right?  It's like very James Bond-y, but Chris Cornell...  I'm not saying it's new, but...  New movie's coming out.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Chris Cornell rules.  That voice is amazing.  And then when it kicks in... 
[02:41:00]  Sure.  Like in the chorus, it's like...  There's an article in the paper.  Really cool.  Is America ready for a black James Bond, too?  No.  I'll take the president, but not James Bond.  He'll say Bond.  Word is Bond.  I actually posted something, and I had an answer to the James Bond thing, with Bond, James  Bond, but I can't repeat it here.  I hear you.  Yeah, I know this song.  Chris Cornell just rules.  Yeah, he is right. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  On yourself, because no one else here will save you.  The arms will betray you.  Guy rules.  Very average.  How can we replace you?  He's amazing.  You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill.  And what a handsome man.  He'll always kill you.  Tall, deep blue eyes, nice cheekbones. 
[02:42:00]  You know, I thought Metallica wrote, Turn the Page.  I didn't know that was Bob Seger's song.  You didn't know that the original was...  God, that used to get played all the time.  Yeah, the original was a massive hit for rock radio.  Matt, what do you got?  Jesus, handsuckers, rock radio.  I'm kidding, you douchebag.  Matt, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling to let you know that Audio Vision is now the spa on 72.  I can't listen to a channel called The Spa.  Yeah, I'm struggling with it myself. 
[02:42:30]  Audio Vision kind of sounded cool.  The Spa.  All right, punch down, fellas.  Hey, do we still have XM Chill?  Anybody out there?  Anybody?  Let's say hi to Anthony in Philly.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm in New York, though, Opie.  Oh, hi.  Can we get Brewer at four now on Raw Dog?  Is that right?  Wait, do we get Brewer now?  Did Raw Dog make the cut?  I think so.  Oh, there's Raw.  Oh, wow, you guys. 
[02:43:00]  Okay.  That's some good news for the XMers today.  You can now hear Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  If you have an XM unit.  That's huge for him, man.  You don't have to pay extra?  No.  Ooh, that's huge.  He's on 150 Raw Dog.  Wow, that's a big move for him.  Hey, Hammer.  That's huge.  Good for our old pal.  Let's say hi to Pat in Belmore.  Pat.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey.  Yeah, I was wondering if I could still hear Rushes the Trees on Deep Tracks and on Top Tracks? 
[02:43:30]  What?  I wanted to know if I could still hear Rushes the Trees on Deep Tracks and on Top Tracks.  And Top Tracks.  Yeah, what about Top Tracks and Big Tracks?  I like Big Tracks.  Well, Deep Tracks is still there.  Deep Tracks is there.  What about Top Tracks?  Yeah, let's look under the Rock category.  Let's look.  What do we got here?  We're doing like a Mike and the Mad Dog thing.  They study this shit when it comes to sports.  Well, you got the Zeppelin channel there, Mikey.  I don't know if they got rid of Top Tracks.  It's going to be a Travis, Steve. 
[02:44:00]  Wow, I don't see Top Tracks.  What?  Come on, they got to have Top Tracks.  Hold on.  Let me go down the Rocks channels because this is what people really care about.  You got the Led Zeppelin channel.  You got the Deep Tracks.  Boo.  It's still around.  You got the Hair Nation.  That's right.  You got Liquid Metal.  Metal.  You got Sirius XMU.  You got the First Wave.  That's all the New Wave stuff Ant and I were talking about.  Spectrum, which is adult album rock.  Classic Vinyl.  That would, I guess, be what replaced Top Tracks, I'm assuming. 
[02:44:30]  No, Top Tracks went all the way, way past 60s and 70s.  Well, it's on, Top Tracks used to be 46 and now on 46 is Classic Vinyl.  So Top Tracks is done.  It's gone, motherfucker.  Alt Nation is on 47.  Then you got the Octane, New Hard Rock on 48.  Classic Rewind.  That's 70s and 80s classic rock.  That's sort of more like Top Tracks stuff.  All right, 70s and 80s could be like that.  Yeah, I got you.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  The Loft.  Yuck.  The Coffee House.  Yuck.  Faction.  The Bath House.  ACTC.  Lithium.  Margaritaville.  Jam On.  That's Jam Bands.  Jam Bands.  God, I got to program that in.  I love a nice long jam.  I thought you didn't like that.  All literal jam.  But this is what I don't understand, man.  Like, if you have a Grateful Dead channel, you could throw in other jam bands and then you 
[02:45:30]  don't need the jam band channel.  Yeah.  That's just dumb.  Right?  So is the next one.  Bruce Springsteen.  E Street Radio.  And Little Stevens Garage Rock.  Why not just have that part of E Street Radio?  Wow.  They really thought that XM just had shit channels.  Well, just like the employees.  Oh, my God.  They threw out all the XM employees and they threw out all the XM channels.  I'm really trying to be a good boy, but there's a bunch of channels that I'm looking over here 
[02:46:00]  that have no business being part of the new lineup.  These are a majority of these.  There's some favoritism going on.  Dude, they're all fucking serious channels.  You know, I'm not going to blow up anyone's spot, but there's a bunch of channels.  As I quickly look at this lineup, there's no reason.  XM got pwned in this merger.  Oh, fucking yeah.  Just fucking pwned.  Oh, fucking yeah.  All the Urban Stations seem to have stayed.  Sirius Music has more talking.  They do have more talking than the XM channels did.  Absolutely. 
[02:46:30]  And did Kane make the cut from Ethel?  He better.  He's going to Alt Nation.  He's the best rock DJ in America.  That guy hands a good egg.  He's amazing.  All the Decade channels that had jocks on Sirius, they're the same channels.  They just took the XM names.  So it's not even the XM program.  So, wait a minute.  What about Flash Phelps?  Who's Flash Phelps?  I'm sure he's gone.  Is Flash Phelps gone?  Yeah.  He was on the 60s channel.  Hey, he was one of those old-style 60s jocks.  A lot of echo in the background, and it was real hokey and shit. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, he's gone?  Is he gone?  And the 70s, do they have like...  They have Barry Williams' show.  Barry Williams' show and stuff.  So it's just...  Right.  They just took the XM names for some of the channels and just put it on theirs.  And then 80s is the MTV, the old MTV...  Yeah, like Nina Blackwood.  I was driving home from...  Oh, Devil's Islanders game with E-Rod.  I thought you were driving home from the Devil's Island.  Yeah.  And that's what I did notice about the Sirius Music channels. 
[02:47:30]  They talk a lot, and they really sound like regular radio.  Shut up!  Just play the music and shut up!  Megan in Virginia.  Megan.  Hey.  Hey.  So I just...  I'm actually...  I work for one of the call centers in Virginia.  And it's...  Like, the phones are blowing up over this.  It's not just, you know...  Ooh, I'm excited about the new channels. 
[02:48:00]  People are mad because they're losing the Spanish channels.  All that.  All the everything.  And people are canceling and everything else.  It's really, really mad.  Well, they're down a one, two, three, four, five Latin and world channels, I guess.  Yeah.  There's a...  It's a tough spot to be in because everyone has their favorites.  We're all...  We tried to say we're not part of this, but the famous, this is not what I'm used to thing?  Yeah.  We're all about that.  You know, like...  I don't know. 
[02:48:30]  I'd imagine that there's going to be more pissed off people than happy people today, but it looks like there's an excitement, too, man.  Now, do these...  There's some stuff here that I've never heard before.  I'll check out.  Do these sync up with Sirius' playlist?  Is this the same thing?  Like, if you have a Sirius unit and you go to channel, whatever, 52, are you going to get faction?  Yes.  For the most part, yes.  Okay.  So, this is what they had to do to eliminate the redundant channels and the cost of running so many channels. 
[02:49:00]  Sure.  It's a smart move if you're a merged company.  It makes...  Sirius was always the smart one.  It makes good business sense.  But, yeah, this is pretty much the same except for, like, you know, you have to pay for us.  To hear us on Sirius.  Yeah.  And people have to pay to hear Howard over here.  Yeah.  But, for the most part, yes.  What we're looking at is what the Sirius people are looking at as well today.  Yes.  How many XM channels stayed?  Not many.  One.  Could you play Lucy for all time's sake? 
[02:49:30]  Sorry, Sally.  Can't do it.  Hey, Anthony.  Wait, Pat St. John is here?  Yeah.  I just wanted to say I love you guys.  All you guys.  You guys are great.  I honestly didn't know anything about you for a while because I was from Illinois.  But when you guys went on to XM, it was...  You guys are great.  And, Jimmy, I love you.  Thank you very much.  What about me?  I'm sick of being floated.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Punching.  Pat St. John is here.  Oh.  Pat, do you like us these days?  I don't remember.  Pat St. John is a legend in this business.  Nothing but respect to this guy right here.  How are you, Pat?  I'm good.  How are you guys?  Well, it's a weird day.  A lot of excitement and a lot of kind of...  A lot of people puzzled about the channels.  A lot of puzzlement.  Puzzled people.  Yeah.  I don't know all those answers.  I know a few of them.  Listen to this fucking voice.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  I...  It doesn't even try either.  I was walking in.  You were talking about Deep Tracks, which...  Yeah, I love Deep Tracks.  Which I'm going to be on now.  Oh, cool.  Oh, you're on Deep Tracks.  I'm going to be on Deep Tracks, yeah.  Is it called Deep Tracks still?  It is.  Well, yeah.  I've been on the vault.  Right.  And now it's going to be Deep Tracks, which is the XM side, but I'll be on there from noon  to four Eastern.  Nice.  Which is cool.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  I'm a little disappointed.  Top Tracks and...  What was the other one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Top Tracks is gone.  I liked that one. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what replaces it.  There's some changes going on.  I mean, I heard you say you were talking about Flash Phelps.  Yes.  Well, he is on and he's now...  Is Flash still on?  Flash is still on.  I heard him this morning.  Oh, okay.  And he's actually doing...  Because I've been on the 60s channel in the morning.  Right.  And so he's taking my slot there, kind of like you guys took my slot years ago at MEW.  Oh, geez.  Well, that's why, as it were, we're getting along these days.  Except now in the morning, I'm going to be doing... 
[02:51:30]  I'm going to be playing 50s music, man, on five.  Wow.  They asked me if I wanted to do that.  I said, sure, you know, roots of rock and roll.  That's cool of me, too.  Damn.  Don't let them send you any further back on the channel there.  Yeah, really.  I'm doing music from the 1850s.  No, no.  That's about as far back as I can go.  Yeah, far back as I can go.  Unless...  And I'm also doing a program on Bluesville, so that one goes back quite a ways.  Yeah.  But that's everything.  That's, you know, spanning the old...  So you're doing a lot of different things for the new lineup.  Yeah.  Wow.  Very cool.  It's cool.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  What are you doing here today?  I'm a music...  Well, I'm just... 
[02:52:00]  I'm going to do a show here.  Get a show from...  Going to do some deep tracks.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  How'd you get a voice like that?  That's great.  I don't know, man.  When I got in the business, I wanted to have the voice.  I know.  Everyone knew it.  I felt very short of that.  It was just like, yeah.  He doesn't try, though.  You'd think you would have to sit up, and he'd just lean it back, and...  No, you do.  You have to sit up.  Oh, yeah.  I have to do everything to try to get this voice to sound like something.  God, last time we saw you, it was at the Hard Rock during that...  That's right.  Beatles thing that they were doing over there. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  I remember that.  There's a picture of us online, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, it got online, and people were like, what is this?  Whoa.  Why is he hanging out with those assholes?  I read the comments.  I'm not dumb.  Yeah.  I did not see those.  Ah, there were a few of them.  Oh, there's a bunch.  They loved you.  There was the old school NEW people, and then when we came in during the debacle of...  What's his name?  Gary.  Gary.  Gary Wall.  Gary Wall.  Gary put us in such a horrible spot.  Oh, it was hard.  We go to the conference room one day, and we're hanging out with all these legendary jocks 
[02:53:00]  that have been there forever and really did very good jobs here in New York radio, and  Gary points us and goes, here's the future.  Here's the future.  And we're two dopes from Boston.  I'm like, oh, thanks for putting us in a bad spot there, Gary.  I wasn't at that particular meeting.  I think I was out of there.  Really going to endear us to Carol Miller and everybody else.  What years were you at NAW from?  Where did I go to?  No, no.  What years were you there from?  I was at NAW from 87 to 98. 
[02:53:30]  And before that was where?  I was at PLJ for about 15 years.  Oof.  Yeah.  Hey, you've been in New York for a while.  That was a long run.  Yeah, it's been a while, since 73.  Oh, gee.  Well, you know, it's a fad.  How long is Pat going to last in New York?  Well, and I also, you know, I started with Satellite in 98, right after I left you guys.  Really?  After I left NAW, because, yeah, I started really with Sirius in October of 98.  You didn't go to E-Yada? 
[02:54:00]  No.  No.  No, I didn't.  That was the graveyard for anybody that was getting fired at the time.  It was getting, yeah, fired.  I forgot about that.  I'm doing something called the internet radio.  What?  But in 98, how many subscribers?  In 98, we weren't on the air yet.  It was a coincidence.  There were 98 subscribers.  Right.  That's what you're saying.  We're not on the air yet.  We were not on the air yet.  We were just, I was just in the process of forming.  It hit in what, 2000 or something?  Yeah.  Something like that?  It was just hitting then, but it was like just developing the channels and figuring out  what we're going to do. 
[02:54:30]  You know what was smart, though?  It was a very small staff at that time.  Sirius, that was smart because they got radio guys.  So they got kind of an idea of what radio is as opposed to, you know, XM, which decided  to get bean counters and cable television people.  Tech guys.  They got a lot of tech guys.  They didn't go for radio guys at first.  Oh, XM could pump out a unit as small as your fingernail.  That's right.  As opposed to the vault that Sirius had they got to put in your car.  But as far as the music went, I really, I like, I always thought Sirius music was better 
[02:55:00]  than the XM.  Yeah.  I mean, most people would have one or the other.  Yeah.  So it wasn't everybody that had both that could compare the two.  Sure.  And so, you know, and it was also, I remember, you know, through the years, it was never,  you know, as a Sirius guy, XM was not really the competition.  It was almost like every other kind of radio was the competition, but we were both on the  same, you know, it was both satellites.  So it wasn't really.  XM didn't think like that.  Well, I mean, that's just, that's one way to look at it. 
[02:55:30]  Must crush them.  And what matters now is, I guess, from today on, because this is like you say, it's a big  day today, but it's going to be interesting.  I know a lot of people who are tuning in, whether they have Sirius or XM, are going to  be surprised by a lot of their stations.  Sure.  But all in all, it's, you know, should be good.  Should be good.  My presets are probably going to be like, hit my preset and I'm going to be like a fruit.  No, I don't know.  I mean, you know, the thing was updating today, but it's got all the names of the, you know,  the right names of the channels.  You know, they did their best trying to get the best of both worlds here, although there's 
[02:56:00]  more of one world than another world here, but what are you going to do?  Yeah.  You know, well, Pat St. John.  Wow.  Cool, man.  Did you, uh, you ever talk to John Lennon or was that Muni?  Uh, no, that was, that was Scatzo.  That was all Scatzo, huh?  Yeah.  Uh, John is the one Beatle I never met.  I, I, I, I met and interviewed all the other ones, but I never met John and that's, uh,  I would, I would have loved to have met John.  You've interviewed, you've interviewed them all.  All.  Who was your favorite of all time? 
[02:56:30]  My, well, see, that's not, I know it's a pretty tough question.  It's weird because some of my favorite artists may not have been the greatest interviews,  you know?  Mm-hmm.  I mean, uh, uh, a particularly great interview was James Taylor, you know?  Uh, who was just, he was just sweet and he sounds great, you know?  I mean, he's, he's been, his, his voice is like as sweet as can be.  He had his guitar and we were just, we just had the greatest.  He'd, he'd play anything I asked him to play.  It was just, we had a great, we had a great conversation.  Whereas, you know, other people, I mean, I've always been a big Leon Russell fan, but 
[02:57:00]  he's not the easiest guy to interview.  Right.  He doesn't remember what he did.  I knew more about what he's played on than he did, you know?  Or, uh, you know, I remember talking to Mitch Ryder.  It was like pulling teeth.  It was awful.  Yeah.  You get those, but you know, it's, it's, you know, I've, I've been lucky cause I've  gotten to speak to most of my heroes.  What years did you get to interview McCartney and the other three Beatles?  Uh, those were pretty much, uh, during the, uh, NAW years. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  And it was, and it was a number, a number of times with Paul.  When Scott was, uh, uh, there, he, he was very nice.  We got along very well.  It was funny cause we were on, when I was on PLJ, we were on opposite each other, but he  was very cool when I went over to NAW, he welcomed me there.  And then when he would have a lot of the, when he'd do a lot of interviews, he'd invite  me in, which was nice.  I kind of just kept quiet.  But if it kind of got, if it kind of got out there, then I would kind of, you know,  help out or whatever, jump in.  And that was fun. 
[02:58:00]  So, I mean, I remember there was a, there was a time that we both went over to the garden  and interviewed Paul backstage before a show.  And that was very cool.  But what year was it?  Like the ebony and ivory?  No, well, it was, yeah, I was getting, well, it was getting later there.  I mean, I, I, I, probably some of those, I, I, I had met Ringo in the PLJ year.  So that was probably late seventies, early eighties.  Probably that was the time, first couple of times for Paul.  I didn't meet George until, uh, the Dylan concert at the garden. 
[02:58:30]  I met him there and he was very nice.  And I did one of the last interviews that he ever did in, which would have been in 97  or early 98.  It was over at the Plaza, which was cool.  Wow.  And, um, he didn't like to give interviews, but I had, I think I was the only radio guy.  It was, he had interviewed, this is, this is kind of a story, a nice story for me.  Anyway, uh, I was chosen to do a radio interview.  It was going to be used on all kinds of stations across the country, but he had produced the new  Robbie Shankar album. 
[02:59:00]  And that's why he was agreeing to do interviews.  So when I got to him, they had the VH one, I think was in the next room.  They got the TV stuff and they were asking them, you know, a lot of beetle questions and  all that.  When, when I sat down with him and Robbie Shankar, I, I started off by talking to Robbie  Shankar, asking him about this.  Then I went to George, asked him, well, when you produce this album, how was it?  I didn't ask him anything.  It was only Robbie.  I was almost, I was almost ignoring George.  And it went on. 
[02:59:30]  And after about 15 minutes, and I still have this on tape and it's great.  George says, well, you asked me a Beatles question.  Oh, really?  And for him to ask me that, it was, that, that's, that was a thrill.  Did he want it or did he know that you were avoiding it?  I don't know.  You know, I mean, those guys were always getting asked the beetle questions.  They probably got tired of it, right?  Well, yeah.  You know, and I, you know, I think he was surprised at that.  That you didn't go near it at all.  Yeah, I mean, but, you know, I was, I mean, he was there to talk about the Ravi, so I talked  about the Ravi Shankar album. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  It's like, I would have much rather asked him all the questions I wanted to, but, you  know, I, you know, I would like to do that because if you, you know, because maybe I'd  get a chance to talk to him again sometime.  Right.  And that never happened, of course.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  How exciting could the Ravi, Ravi Shankar album be well.  Well, yeah, it was, you know, it was, it was a little tough, but that's why he was doing  it, so I was trying to, you know, yeah, respect that.  Well, a lot of, a lot of good years in the business and many more. 
[03:00:30]  It was fun.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Well, you're still, you're still rocking, man.  Nothing but respect for Pat St. John.  Absolutely.  So, uh, we hear you.  Oh, go on, beat me up.  Nah.  Are you kidding?  We've learned over the years a little bit.  Got to respect some people out there.  Um, so, so you're doing, uh, not top, it's not called top tracks anymore.  Deep tracks.  Yeah.  Well, deep tracks.  I mean, deep tracks.  Deep tracks in the fifties, uh, yeah.  On five.  All right.  Very cool.  Who were the other guys at PLJ when you were there in the seventies?  I mean, growing up, I remember as a kid, listen. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, Tony Pig.  Tony Pig.  All right.  Good friend of mine.  With the big ball.  Tony Pig had the biggest ball.  How about, uh.  Remember?  You don't remember Tony?  Well, you don't.  No.  What?  What are you talking about?  That's more about him than I ever knew.  Yeah.  All I gotta do is look at his pants, uh, Pat.  There was something going on in there.  We all, you don't remember?  No.  No.  Did we get sued for this one too?  I don't remember.  I'm trying to remember.  No, I'm sure we didn't.  No.  I don't know.  It was a whole thing that was going on with him and in the front of his pants. 
[03:01:30]  I wasn't the only one.  Wow.  You paid more attention.  No, I guess you were.  No, this was like a bowling ball.  Oh, Opie.  This was over the top.  Maybe it was only when you were in the room.  This was over the top.  I don't know.  All right.  Anyway, Tony Pig.  Who else?  Yeah.  Tony Pig.  Carol Miller.  Yeah.  How about John Zackerley, man?  Zackerley.  Zackerley.  Hello.  Zackerley.  Zach is, uh, he just turned.  Get out of here.  He just turned, in September, he turned 90.  Jesus.  Wow.  And he was just, and he was just on TV on, uh, on Halloween. 
[03:02:00]  Well, actually, it was, I guess, the day before.  What was Halloween?  Friday?  Yeah, he would always do that Halloween thing.  It was the week before Halloween.  He was on Channel 11 in New York.  Which is going back to PIX.  Doing his, you know, his, um, chiller theater thing.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  And when they started the show, I mean, it was unbelievable.  He's laying down in his casket, but all of a sudden, his feet rose up, and he got up.  90 years old, man.  He just doesn't need to use the makeup anymore.  Oh, man.  You beat me to it.  I was right there, Pat. 
[03:02:30]  It's true.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice.  He's amazing.  They save on the makeup.  At that age, I'd be a little leery of climbing into a casket.  Yeah.  It's like, eh.  He probably just got rid of his bed.  Like, I'll just stay here.  Cut down the shipping.  It's inevitable.  He's a great guy.  Right on.  Wow.  He used to, you know, he used to open up some Grateful Dead shows, man.  They loved him.  Did they?  Oh, yeah.  Did fans like Zacherli?  Will you explain the Grateful Dead to these two knuckleheads?  There's no explaining to people that aren't fans.  It's really...  Let's see if Pat could do it.  I've never been a fan of the Dead.  I just wasn't into that scene.  When I was growing up, it was more about, you know, Skinner and Marshall Tucker and... 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, it was a different thing.  I mean, the Grateful Dead, you have to have plenty of time.  Yeah.  You know?  Plenty of drugs.  Because it takes a while.  Well, I think a lot of that, though, a lot of that was, you know, people would follow  them around.  And the thing about the Dead is that they were not conventional and that the set would change  every night.  They didn't know what they were going to play until they played it.  And so for the people who would get deep into music, they knew they weren't going to 
[03:03:30]  get the same set.  They weren't going to get the hits.  They were going to get whatever the hell the Grateful Dead wanted to give them.  And there was an appeal to that.  Like, when I go to see The Who, I want to hear the hits.  That's, you know, what I want to hear.  And with the Grateful Dead, I never knew what a hit was from them.  Like, their actual, their hits, they wouldn't ever play because that was considered the  sellout, Dad.  Exactly.  Or they played it in such a way it was unrecognizable.  It's just the yin and the yang and what people prefer and what they don't. 
[03:04:00]  The people that don't like the hits.  Yeah, sure.  I just never got the scene, though, you know?  Did you ever interview Black Sabbath?  No, I did.  Jimmy did.  I did an appearance with Ozzy once.  We rode in a limo down to a record store down in the village for an autograph signing.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know what I was doing there, but, you know.  We all agree on this show that Black Sabbath is probably the most overrated band in the  history of rock.  Where are you at with that?  We don't agree with that.  What, Jimmy?  What happened?  Nothing. 
[03:04:30]  Oh.  Jimmy's probably the biggest Sabbath fan ever.  Of all time.  Of all time.  And when he interviewed them, it was so nerve-wracking to watch him because he was just like, he  didn't know how to ask questions.  He was all shaky.  He was a little boy.  It's nice to see somebody really in front of their heroes.  Yeah.  Well, that's a thrill to do, and sometimes when you're that into somebody, it's very tough.  Yeah.  You turn into a blithering fool.  Yes, you did.  Yeah, I really am the worst.  So you lose weight, you look good. 
[03:05:00]  Nothing.  No information that's pertinent.  Well, you know, I guess you learn that, you know, people are, see, that's because you're  thinking that they're superhuman, I guess.  Yeah.  You know?  Because most people, when you interview them, they're just, they're actually, when it comes  down to it, they're a human being, too.  Yeah.  So, you know, you can talk about normal things.  Yeah.  They appreciate that.  Greatest rock song of all time.  Greatest rock song of all time.  I've spun them all, my friend, for many, many years.  We say whip it. 
[03:05:30]  Whip it good.  Oh, man, that is, that is really tough.  You know?  Do you go with Free Bird?  Do you go with Stairway to Heaven?  No, no, no.  Do you go a little obscure?  Do you have any of your hands, Ronnie Van Zet?  Uh, no.  No.  Emceed a few concerts, but didn't interview them.  Yeah.  But you met him?  Yeah, man, I was shaking hands.  Hi, how you doing?  You know?  Uh-huh.  But no, you know, nothing besides that.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, actually, I stood this close to Hendrix one time.  Wow. 
[03:06:00]  Didn't actually get to meet him.  I introduced the opening act at a Hendrix show, but I actually stood about this far,  but there was no approaching him.  Yeah.  Why?  He was aloof for people around him?  He was just standing, he was standing.  It was Hendrix.  I mean, I was very young, I was emceeing this show opening up, he had taken a band under  his wing, it was Cat Mother and the All Night Newsboys, and they were opening.  Yeah, they really took off.  Well, they had one song, but they were opening up, I introduced them, and I was just backstage  on the side of the stage, but he was just, you know, he was holding his guitar waiting 
[03:06:30]  to go on, you know, the second to close and all of that, and smoking a cigarette, and  there was just no walking up, there was no way you could walk up to them.  Yeah, you don't walk up to that.  You know?  No way.  That was not, especially as a kid, you know?  That just wasn't going to happen.  Yeah.  That is so fucked up to us, because people like Hendrix are so dead to us.  Yeah.  No, they are, though.  We can't comprehend them ever.  That's a long time ago.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You ever meet, like, Jim Morrison?  Nope.  Okay.  Nope.  But you remember him being alive?  Yeah.  I saw the doors once. 
[03:07:00]  Never.  You saw the doors.  Oh, yeah.  That's an easy one.  And what do we get to go?  Oh, yeah.  I saw, you know.  Foo Fighters.  I don't get it.  I bumped into the guy from Blind Melon once in a 7-Eleven in L.A.  Good for you.  Shannon.  I just made it.  Good for you.  All right, Pat.  Thank you so much for stopping in.  Yeah, Pat.  Absolutely.  Continued success.  My pleasure.  I walked in, and I heard you talking about deep tracks and all of these things.  Yeah.  I'm glad you made the cut, my friend, because many people did not.  Yeah.  So am I.  A lot of good people were shown the door, unfortunately. 
[03:07:30]  Absolutely.  And I don't like to see that.  Absolutely.  I'm sure the New York Radio message board will be abuzz with this.  Oh, my God.  I hope Anthony got along with Pat St. John.  Pat talks to scum.  I guess hell froze over.  Thank you, guys.  That's great.  We had nothing to respect for Scott Muni, man.  He welcomed us when we went to NW.  He was a good guy.  I'll never forget that.  Really.  All right.  Thank you.  I'd like to party that guy.  See you later.  Thanks, man.  I'm going to take a photo of Pat.  Yeah, you should.  I've asked her before.  Yo, do that, Jimmy. 
[03:08:00]  You should.  Anthony, this all leads to something that OrbitCast posted today.  OrbitCast.  OrbitCast.com.  I think they're fans of the show, or a couple of the guys that work on the site are, anyway.  Anyway, and the last episode of XM Saturday Night on the last night of Lucy, so Lucy went  away, and the PD, I guess his name was Bill Hutton, and he knew he was going bye-bye, that  he wasn't making the cut. 
[03:08:30]  So he said goodbye to everybody, and listened to the humor of this Bill Hutton.  As he says goodbye.  He went out in style, my friends.  XM Saturday Night, where we have limped to our last song ever on Lucy.  But before we get to another forgettable alternative rock song, there are some people who need to  be thanked, so that hopefully one day, I can ruin their dreams again.  First of all, thanks to God, for making me fail miserably at a career in broadcasting. 
[03:09:00]  Way to go, God.  Thanks to Genevieve, who would have answered your phone calls if anyone would have ever  called.  Thanks to my parents, for giving me absolutely no skills whatsoever, for doing anything with  my life.  To my darling Bridget, thank you for gladly giving up your Saturday nights so that I could  fail more easily.  That's fucking very funny.  Guy rolls, Bill Hutton.  Show him the door, and he went out in style.  It continued. 
[03:09:30]  To Bailey, for the satellite radio stock tip.  Because of you, we'll be eating ramen noodles again tonight.  To Dan Turner, for not staying up this late to hear me thanking.  To the management of XM, who were so incompetent that they let a show like this get on the  air in the first place.  To Lee Abrams, who had a wonderful dream that radio could be smart, creative, and fun again.  What the hell were you thinking?  And to our listeners, both of you, this show has been a joy, and I appreciate you allowing 
[03:10:00]  me the honor of ruining your weekend.  I thank you and leave you tonight with a song that started this show slightly more than  a year ago.  The Foo Fighters, and times like these.  From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for listening to XM Saturday Night.  Good night.  Not bad, right?  That was good.  What show was it?  What show was that?  That was on Lucy.  Oh, wow. 
[03:10:30]  The PD Bill Hutton.  And then it ended with this, the closing credits.  XM Saturday Night was written by William T. Hutton.  Where the Wild Things Are was written by Maurice Sendak.  Hieroglyphics were written by Bird Eye Bird Water Basket.  While in D.C., guests of XM Saturday Night stay on the beautiful bench in the train station.

[03:11:00]  So, farewell, saddle pals.  Our party.  There you go.  And that was it, huh?  That was it for him.  Wow.  That was it for him.  Downright depressing the last three months, seeing all these guys do their goodbyes and  their emails and everything else.  All right, we'll take a break and continue.  We got the Victoria's Secret bra thing.  Making women sick.  Making women sick?  Yeah, they're getting sick by the bras.  We're going to find out next, Jimmy.  Why?  Sick of their bras.  What's the bras doing? 
[03:11:30]  Brar.  What are the bras doing?  We'll find out next.  Thanks, Brar.  What did you say?  Nothing.  I was just looking at the other list for the, you know, because we were looking at the XM  list.  Right. 
[03:12:00]  And this is the Sirius list that I'm looking at.  Right.  And let's see.  Then it says, the best of XM available on Sirius requires a subscription package, blah,  blah, blah.  And there's Oprah, public radio with Bob Edwards, and then Opie and Anthony, the virus channel.  And then play-by-play sports, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Now, on the music end, what is this, slow? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's under his own name there.  What do you mean?  Howard's got just Howard Stern.  It's, you know, Howard 100, Howard 101.  Then there's talk news.  Then there's entertainment.  Oh, he's on, he, he has his own category?  Yes.  We don't have our own category.  I'm looking for the category of advantage, advantage, advantage, advantage, yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Try it again.  Yeah.  No, you know what I meant.  Advantage taken of?  Yes.  Nah, what are you going to do?  What do we want?  Our own category?  It ain't never going to happen.  I just wish the people at Sirius would have, like, real talks with us instead of the psychobabble  they give us, because they, we used to be in the talk category, now we're in the comedy  category, now certainly this show is a funny show, but there's also a category called entertainment, 
[03:13:30]  and like Anthony pointed out during the break, we would fit in that category perfectly.  I think we fit better in the entertainment.  Because there are times we're dead serious on this fucking show.  Yeah.  And people are going to tune in and go, well, they're not being funny for a comedy channel.  Comedy, because comedy section seems like a lot of just, like, stand-up comedy recordings.  I'm flattered they think we're a funny show, but I think we're more of a entertainment show.  But why have a say in any of this stuff? 
[03:14:00]  Well, we don't know much about ourselves, right?  We don't know anything.  Same old shit.  Same old shit.  Same old shit.  You know, a man once said to me, the more things change, the more things stay the same.  Wow.  Who said that?  I said to that man, don't talk to me, I'm urinating.  And he said to me, I know you're a bigger boy than average.  Oh my God, Jimmy.  I'm like, what do you mean about the changing, staying the same?  And he said, I didn't know what else to say to you. 
[03:14:30]  Stop, wait, I'm cross-referencing.  Oh, are you cross-referencing?  I'm cross-referencing.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Da-da-da, 27.  Let me look over here.  What chart am I looking at?  All right.  The channel numbers do not line up.  Oh, boy.  Between Sirius and XM.  Because there's a different amount of channels, I think.  They didn't have 202 on Sirius because it doesn't exist.  No.  Right?  We're 197 on Sirius.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, but even everything else, aside from, you know, the decades things, which are pretty 
[03:15:00]  easy.  Yeah.  But if you look here, you know, you've got to go all the way up to channel 47 for Alt-Nation.  Right.  Meanwhile, Alt-Nation is channel 21 on Sirius.  What?  Yeah, but no one's going to know because if you have a Sirius unit, it is what it is.  21 is Alt-Nation.  They know that.  Well, what if we skip to every other channel, start in the basement, and then switch?  All right. 
[03:15:30]  Can we move on before we get in trouble?  Yes.  Going with Jimmy's thing.  The Who said it best.  Who?  Meet the new boss.  Same as the...  Who?  Who?  Same as the...  Hey, we got a bestiality story for everybody.  Who said it best.  The Who said it best.  They said, talking about my generation.  I like that song.  Talking about my generation. 
[03:16:00]  My...  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.  That was always fun to sing along to, though, Jimmy.  It was.  Not a fan of Athena myself.  I didn't like my generation.  Really?  I didn't like the gimmicky, stuttery thing.  What about your...  What about the Magic Bus?  I didn't like that either.  People try to put...  Not a fan.  No?  Why did I put the...  I liked...  I liked Who's Next.  Yeah.  A lot of things off of Who's Next was good.  Baba O'Reilly.  Yes.  That stuff. 
[03:16:30]  Not Barbara.  No.  It was Baba.  Baba.  That was some shit.  Behind Blue Eyes.  Yeah, man.  When I was a youngster, I thought they were singing about me.  Did ya?  Oh, you should've.  By the way, Minnesota, 206 votes.  Dude, these two are...  Wow.  This is a great story.  They found votes for Al Franken in Minnesota.  I found votes.  They certainly hope that fucking idiot doesn't win.  Who, Al Franken?  Yeah. 
[03:17:00]  He is the worst fucking example of a liberal cunt that I've ever seen.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Unless Janine Garofalo was running for something.  And then she would be the worst?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then she would.  Where did Jimmy go?  Jimmy!  We're still broadcasting!  Maybe Jimmy has to wee-wee.  Uh-oh.  We better get the funny back, because we're a comedy channel.  Yes!  You're listening to a comedy channel.  Comedy.  See, less pressure when you're a talk channel.  Look, I'm talking. 
[03:17:30]  Then we're talking.  We're doing our job.  Right.  Now, for some reason, people assume we have to be funny.  Right.  Oh, we gotta be funny.  We gotta make you laugh, do we?  You know, we've been around a really long time.  Ask us a few simple questions.  Just a few simple questions.  We can help you with some of this heavy lifting here.  Yay!  Yay!  This is an entertainment show.  Right.  We get very serious at times.  We get silly at times.  We get boring as hell at times.  And then part of that, we're funny at times.  Yes.  We're all-encompassing.  We should be in the at times category. 
[03:18:00]  At times?  Right.  Hold on.  Just a skit.  What is Jimmy doing?  He's looking for a...  A who song?  He's looking for his book.  We usually have a copy of his book in the bin, but today it's mysteriously disappeared.  Why does he need a book today?  He has to write some stuff.  Jimmy, why do you need your book today?  I'll tell you what.  I'm doing an interview in a few minutes.  Not after.  I just wanted to book a couple of pages, which I could do while we're talking.  Who are you doing an interview with today?  BJ Shane Seattle.  Fucking BJ? 
[03:18:30]  I love BJ.  Love the BJ.  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  They're great friends of the show.  Yeah.  That's good stuff.  BJ rules.  Yeah, they're genuine, man.  There's nothing phony about those guys.  Yeah.  You want an embarrassing cuckold story?  What could be embarrassing?  It's footer.  The bull wasn't as hung as he had claimed in his head.  The cleanup duty was shorter than you'd expected.  Not enough of her yeast infection to lick out of the bull's pubes.  I'll keep going because that happens.  That white yeast shows up on the base of that black gift. 
[03:19:00]  And cleanup duty is to get it off.  Wow.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Yeah, footer does the cuckolding.  You're the bull, though, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I hear what you guys say, bull.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, what happened?  Anyway, Jimmy, love the book.  Thank you very much, buddy.  No problem, bud.  All right, check this out.  I have a little bit of an embarrassing one.  Jimmy, as you know, once in a while there's called like a blow and go, where it's not like 
[03:19:30]  a session.  You're just going over quick.  Anyway, I swing by there.  I don't even know these people at all.  Never hooked up with them before.  Roll in, do my thing.  I go to leave, get in a parking lot, stop my car.  It doesn't start, dude.  Now I have to call these people back up and get a jump.  I can't stop my car.  Wow.  What did you do?  You fucked your wife in front of the husband?  No, actually, she didn't want to get back.  She just wanted to get like played with.  And then now she blew me. 
[03:20:00]  And she wanted to load in the face.  Did he walk?  How do you meet these people?  Bro, Craigslist is insane.  Oh, yeah.  You got to have at least seven and a half, eight.  Fucking send a picture.  All right.  Well, how about, can I have a picture of your dick so I can meet some people?  Yeah.  I need a stunt cock.  That's great.  Yo, but yeah, it was so embarrassing to have to give a call back up there.  And like the dude was a dick too.  Yeah.  He was like, oh, I can't do anything about it. 
[03:20:30]  I'm sitting in this parking lot at the fuck two in the morning going, oh, shit.  Dude, what do you expect?  He just came on his wife.  He wanted to help you fucking get home too.  I wouldn't nearly quite realize what just happened.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right, boys.  Jimmy, great job with the book, man.  No, thanks a lot, man.  Absolutely.  I'm reading through it as, I was going to say as we speak, but that would be crazy.  That would be very silly.  Because you'd be laughing too hard to speak.  Tugboat, what's going on?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Tugboat.  You rule, brother, with that book.  Thank you very much.  Listen, Opie, I'm curious about something. 
[03:21:00]  I know why Fez ain't picking on Anthony, because Anthony's got enough fucking guns to start  a war with a small country.  But why all of a sudden, my brother Opie, the man I love the best on the show, because  we're fellow caddies, why in the fuck is Fez insinuating that you're gay?  He spent a good deal of yesterday's Ron and Fez show insinuating that you were gay.  That's outrageous.  What the hell's he doing?  I don't know, because, you know, that fucking guy couldn't get laid in a whorehouse. 
[03:21:30]  I mean, not in one of those places that Jimmy used to go to.  So, I don't really understand.  I don't know.  That's probably...  Here's the deal.  Yeah.  Yesterday, Fez kept saying, well, he kept making references to you.  He goes, I think he's getting married because it's a beard.  He made references to you being so concerned about your weight, so concerned about what  you eat, and you wear puka shells. 
[03:22:00]  I don't feel like having a fucking heart attack in my 40s.  I know.  I got heart disease in my family out the ass.  I see what's coming down the track, and I'm trying to take care of myself.  I think Fez is probably joking.  Yeah, I'm sure he is.  I don't think he was.  I'm taking the serious angle.  I'm scared shitless of my health because of the family history.  Opie, and you should be, brother, because let me tell you something.  I've already beat cancer, and I had a total kidney failure a few years ago, and the doctor 
[03:22:30]  when I got to the hospital says, you are not going to be here tomorrow.  You really beat it, or does it just kind of go in the basement for a while?  Yeah.  Fez is just trying to have fun, and everybody's all of a sudden doing a...  He's turning into the fucking Dr. Steve Hour.  You know, I had polyps.  Can Fez just be funny?  God, give Fez a break.  What's that, sweetie?  I think, Jimmy, I think you ought to give Fez a good face fucking.  I would be happy to.  Wow, let's leave Fez alone.  Simply, no, no, if Fez, you would have it.  I would give it to Fez out of love. 
[03:23:00]  If Fez, he said, look, Jimbo.  All right, you go right ahead.  Sorry, I didn't mean to finish the film.  No, no, no, it's all about you.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  I already had two minutes, 25 seconds too long.  Yeah, we'll move on.  I'm sure Fez was having some fun, and unfortunately, I didn't hear a lot of Ron and Fez yesterday.  I heard like the first half hour or so, and then I had too many phone calls going on yesterday  about the wedding.  Ah.  Well, you said that everything's fixed now, it's all easy? 
[03:23:30]  The wedding?  Everything's fixed now, it's all easy.  But it's not...  Yeah, as far as myself and my girl go, yeah, it should be easy.  Everyone else is making it difficult.  It's amazing.  Damn those people.  Run off and elope.  Dude.  Just run off somewhere and say, hey, we got married.  And then don't even say, we'll have a small ceremony when we get back for family, because  it never turns into that.  It's like, oh, then this one's got to be invited.  I went, when I got, when I went through my tragedy, when I got married, it was a justice 
[03:24:00]  of the peace.  And it was just, just want two witnesses there, and that was it.  Right.  That's it.  Just someone to sign the fucking papers.  And then it turned into this one and that one.  Well, then if this one comes, this one's got to go.  And before you knew it, it was a, you know, the biggest white trash fucking Long Island  piece of shit wedding you could ever imagine.  But it was a lot more than I wanted. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  I just wanted justice of the peace and fucking get married.  You know how bad this got away from us?  All of a sudden we learned, honestly, recently.  Oh, no.  That it's a black tie thing.  That wasn't us.  How did you learn that?  That wasn't us.  That wasn't you?  No.  Because I was cursing you for that.  A lot of people are.  It's like, who the fuck?  Why did you just say that?  Hey, Senator Hughes, what the fuck are we getting?  Actually, I got, like, you know, close family members saying, I can't go because I can't  afford a tux. 
[03:25:00]  I can't get a goddamn tux.  So we got the word out.  It's optional.  This is what happened.  The whole thing got, like, taken away from us.  I went an afternoon with Danny and measured for tuxes.  It was hysterical.  Right.  Watching Danny with his hair sticking out.  And how this fat load of shit guy that was measuring kept telling Danny, we have the  same body type.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It was not funny.  Danny's giant 17-inch neck.  A special cummerbund to fit around that liver. 
[03:25:30]  He's got the pictures to prove it.  Oh, yeah.  We're all...  Dude.  He was trying to guess how big his neck was.  And he goes to 17 inches.  And we were calling him old fat neck.  I have a big fat neck.  Jesus.  17 inches.  Big fatty neck.  People don't...  To behead you with electrical equipment.  People don't understand.  Planning a wedding is ridiculously stressful.  And we're...  I'm lucky enough to have, like, a wedding planner.  So, like, they do a lot of the heavy lifting shit.  Yeah.  But still, it's phone calls and conference calls. 
[03:26:00]  And let's meet with this person and meet with that person.  I'm like, why am I paying you?  This is why I'm paying you.  Yeah.  So, you do all this.  It is so fucking stressful.  And someone said, the only thing more stressful than planning a wedding is losing a kid.  Jesus.  But...  That's quite a...  The only thing more fun than planning a wedding is fun.  I didn't hear it.  But...  I mean, that's...  But second is...  I'd rather see a few centerpieces out by the garbage instead of, well...  But, dude, planning a wedding is second to only that. 
[03:26:30]  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  At least you don't have to make a room a den.  I'll make it an office.  Oh, Jesus.  Instead of feeling love, I'll come in here and work.  But, man, you got the chance to elope.  Go somewhere nice and just do it, man.  Yeah.  It's so much easier.  So many people have come up to me like, oh, my God, you're going through the same shit 
[03:27:00]  I did.  I thought this was supposed to be fun for everybody.  So, how did they come up with a black tie?  I don't...  I don't...  Like, somebody had to say...  I don't know.  That's a good idea.  I don't know.  We'll have everyone dress like the wedding party.  Well, you know me.  I don't pay attention to details.  And one day I looked at...  It's a pretty big detail.  One day I looked at our invite that's on the...  You know, it's been on the refrigerator since the first printing.  And I'm like, wow, wait, this is a black tie.  It's like a White House dinner.  Right. 
[03:27:30]  And I'm like, we better get the word out.  That's optional.  I'm like, I didn't know.  Jesus.  And you know how many tuxes I'm paying for?  Because I feel guilty now.  Oh, boy.  Because people said, you want me to add you to the list?  I will.  I owe you a few bucks from that cruise thing still, I'm sure.  I wouldn't mind if you would pay for my tux.  I'll pay for your tux.  I wouldn't mind if...  But whatever.  I got to go get fitted today, man.  How are they going to get...  They're going to have to get...  I think it's weird because I have a 31 waist, but my cock is so fucking big.  Oh, and a tux will be nice and loose, though. 
[03:28:00]  They have to fucking lower the pants.  You can feel your rod through your pockets really good in a tux also.  I have no one to bring, by the way, to the wedding.  That's all right.  It's not all right.  The Philly crew, man.  It's all right.  Trust me.  It's not all right.  Get a rod and stick it in your cummerbund.  Jimmy hates Philly girls.  Terrible.  It's going to one.  What's that?  What's going to one?  Hey, what's going to one besides me not fucking?  I hate doing.  What do you want to do besides not fuck?  Hey, what's going on?  You hungry?  Not for pussy, I hope.  Jimmy, no black tie for you.  I'm going to wear black tie.  You don't have to.  If Jimmy doesn't wear one now, it's going to look silly. 
[03:28:30]  Jimmy will look like the bum.  Who cares?  Jimmy's getting off the plane at 11.40 that morning.  I'm flying at one in the morning from Vegas, right into fucking Houston, and then from  Houston, I have a plane to Philly, and then from Philly, I go right to the hotel, I put  on my non-tuck suit, and I fucking buffalo shuffle over the fucking wedding party.  You fall asleep in your soup.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to do the fucking curly shuffle. 
[03:29:00]  I'll fucking curly shuffle right over to the reception.  And tee-hee-hee during the whole thing.  I want to find a gal to slow dance with.  Yeah.  Press my fucking Levitra rod right into her, unsuspectingly.  During a real nice slow one.  Exactly.  You know, you need to pull your pants down a little bit, and then stick your dick into  the bottom of your cummerbund, so you only see a fleshy little band of cock between  the top of your pants and the cummerbund. 
[03:29:30]  And the cummerbund looks like it's crying.  There's a little leaky tear coming down.  Looks like you got bubblegum.  And then when you dance, rub real hard on the women's dresses.  It looks like you got chewing gum stuck to your cummerbund.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, what is that?  And people touch it, and it's your dick.  And then purposely mispronounce it as cunt-per-bum.  Jimmy, was it you?  We were at some joint on Long Island, and you decided to talk to some girl with your dick  completely out, and we were all waiting to see how long it would take for this girl to  notice that you're having a normal conversation with her. 
[03:30:00]  With his dick hanging out.  Hanging out of his zipper.  And then you put your balls on a girl's leg, I think.  Yeah, same guy.  Or my balls on my penis against her jeans.  Yeah.  It was a sexual assault, basically.  It really was.  Make you idiots laugh.  Yeah.  And it did.  As it should have.  Hey, Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Hearing someone with a wedding planner whine like a bitch, priceless.  My whining has barely.  Oh.  Has barely boiled.  Right?  And everyone told you not to get hitched. 
[03:30:30]  Who's everybody?  Not even Anthony.  Like, secretly saying, you know.  I didn't say nothing.  Maybe on the air.  Should have listened, dummy.  I'm very psyched that I'm getting married.  What can I tell you?  I'll say nothing to nobody.  I just sit back and watch the hijinks.  Unfold.  Yeah.  And hope for the best.  Right, Ed?  You only get into trouble if you give people advice on things like love, marriage, children,  things like that.  Religion. 
[03:31:00]  All right.  Finances.  If I was going to get married.  Yeah.  Look, but I'll get something out of them.  All right.  The ex.  Yeah.  What about her?  If I said I was getting married to her.  Oh, I wouldn't have said not to.  You wouldn't have said shit?  No.  No one said nothing to me.  I had to suffer.  Fuck you's all.  Yeah, that's a good point.  I think the same thing.  It's one of those situations.  No one uttered a peep.  We got to talk about that someday.  I stood in that stupid justice of the peace office and I had a few friends. 
[03:31:30]  But as friends, you see your friend doing something.  Why can't friends just step up and go, yo, dude.  They always say it after the fact.  Friends don't let friends marry cunts.  That's what it should be.  Always after the fact.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to say something.  But I figured.  Dude, everyone knew she was fucking.  That's the one.  Dude.  Everyone talked about it.  Everyone knew.  Everyone but me.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks for helping me out as my best friend.  Swedish bestiality ring exposed. 
[03:32:00]  Oh.  A Swedish newspaper has exposed a network of self-proclaimed.  Oh, boy.  Zoo files, Jimmy.  Yeah, zoo files are people who fuck animals.  Who meet regularly in locations around the country to have sex with animals.  Good pet owners is also another way of hands-on pet owners.  Yeah.  He'll give them attention.  The attention they deserve.  Exactly.  That's what that dog wants when he's yelling when you come home.  He wants a good fuck.  I don't want to scratch behind the ears.  Anyone can do that.  Yeah.  Fast Freddy. 
[03:32:30]  He's got an itch under his tail that needs satisfying.  He wants you to grab the scruff of his neck, put him on his back, and fuck him like a pig.  That's what your schnauzer wants.  Fuck your mutt.  And then rub your dick under that fucking waterlogged little hair that hang off his chin.  Yeah, dog toys have.  Oh, those smelly, wet hairs under his chin.  Coochie, coochie with my dick.  Yeah, slap his face violently with a cock.  He'll be so scared and confused.  He won't know why.  He'll just know it's wrong.  I don't know what you're doing. 
[03:33:00]  Make that scared, confused look where they look up with their eyes all sad.  Yeah.  Big cocks on his gums.  Lick, pig.  Lick my cock, you stupid dog.  I'll fucking throw you through a fucking window.  You don't even understand what you're doing right now, dummy.  Yeah.  You're queer.  Yeah, you're a fag dog.  And then you fucking, and you cum on his little dog gums and throw him out the window.  Hope you can fly, shit dick.  Too bad you're not a bird. 
[03:33:30]  Come on, dog gums.  They're stupid.  They've got the dumb mouths you could shoot a load right through sideways.  Wouldn't even touch his mouth.  You have to fucking throw him out there if you make cummy on his gums.  Or bring your paper with a load in it.  What if your mom comes over and licks her face now?  Exactly.  You've got to kill it.  No, you don't.  That's why you keep it.  And you put some, give mom some peanut butter rouge.  Here you go, bitch.  Merry Christmas. 
[03:34:00]  So no doggy treats comes in chlorine flavored.  Would that be creepy?  Just to jerk off into your friend's dog's dog dish.  No, your buddy has a dog.  Just jerk off into the dog dish and put it down.  And then tell him, look where the dog's looking up.  Because you know a stupid dog would go right for it.  Nom, nom, nom.  Licking the plate like it's fucking ice cream.  Are we being a comedy channel, a entertainment channel, or a talk news channel? 
[03:34:30]  Wow.  Talk news.  I think we're in talk news territory right now.  It's a story about bestiality.  Yep.  Here we are.  Fast Freddy is correcting himself.  I meant prior to your girl.  None of you were pro-marriage.  That's right.  There was a famous promo that ran on NAW.  Remember it said, my wife's not even born yet?  Yes.  Man, did I come close to trying to close right in on that shit.  I came close.  All right, well. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Bestiality.  I love when I'm watching something that is from a year that is just such a vivid memory for me.  And an adult memory.  You know, it's maybe from like, you know, 1987 or something like that.  And I'm thinking back like, oh, yeah, I was touring around with my band or, you know, just doing whatever.  And then I hear, that's the year I was born.  No.  Mmm.  No.  No. 
[03:35:30]  Mmm.  That was a weirdness to it, though.  No, no.  Never a weirdness.  It's wonderful.  Are you kidding me?  It's fucking so hot.  Fantastic.  I love that.  There's a weirdness to it.  No.  It's wonderful.  I was looking at.  I love when workers come to the house and go, is your daddy home?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And then I got to come to the door.  Give her a big tongue kiss.  Freak the guy out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, sweetie.  Tell mommy.  Tell mommy the wash is done.  A big tongue kiss.  Pat her on the ass as she walks away. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Grab her from underneath.  We need to pull underpants.  Yeah, yeah.  Straighten her out.  Just rub like that.  All right, listen.  You don't find it, like, a little strange, though.  Yeah.  No.  Wonderful.  No, what?  It's great.  I was looking at pictures, like, my girl was on vacation in the Bahamas or somewhere.  Yeah.  And I was doing, and the pictures had the ear on.  Oh, you did a little math, did you?  Oh, boy.  A little weird.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  That part was a little weird.  No.  Good stuff.  Ah.  So, around the country, they're having sex with animals.  The group, consisting of an estimated 30 people, is headed by a 45-year-old father of two.  The unmarried former managing director is also moderator of a large internet animal sex forum  and has a number of dogs and horses on his farm in southern Sweden.  But the man was quick to defend his relations with a bitch he bought online from a city-dwelling family  who said they wanted the dog to have a better life in the countryside. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Better life.  You ship your dog off to a farm.  To get fucked.  And you just have nothing but, you're just thinking the dog's got to be in heaven.  Yeah.  This is great.  There's a riffing thing going on.  Oh, it's going to the country.  It's going to be able to run, chase little animals around, dig holes, do whatever it  wants.  Oh, and get fucked in the ass.  Right.  Lassie.  Lassie. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Come here, Lassie.  Where are you?  Come here, boy.  So, because he got passionate about...  Good boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  A bitch.  Countryside.  Any of the times I did anything with her, she was the one who backed into me and provoked  it?  She was in heat and made herself available? 
[03:38:00]  Oh, blame it on the victim.  That's it.  Oh!  There you go.  I'm being subtle.  Huh?  I'm looking for a sound effect, so I just blurt it out.  All right.  We'll find that.  So, this guy, he's defending his relationship with his dog that he got from a city-dwelling  family.  He lives in the countryside.  And this is his quote again.  Any of the times I did anything with her, the dog, she was the one who backed into me 
[03:38:30]  and provoked it.  She was in heat and made herself available.  Yeah.  Slut.  There were also times later when she didn't want to, and then I backed out immediately.  So, if she wasn't into this thing, this sex, he would just bail and wait for her to be  in heat again, I guess.  In heat?  Yeah.  All right.  What's wrong with that?  Oh, everything.  Shit.  Thank you.  What was I thinking for a second?  During the time spent with members of the network, this guy learned that the group regularly 
[03:39:00]  brought along, oh, the newspaper learned that the group regularly brought along a range of  different animals to sex meetings at rented premises.  Wouldn't that be cool?  It's like, you know, hey, what do we got tonight?  Ah, a goat.  Yeah, this is wonderful.  Wow.  We got a goat tonight.  And then you'd be fucking that.  It's almost like the car club I belong to.  It's like, hey, what do you want to fuck tonight?  Ah, because it's like, you know, what do you want to drive? 
[03:39:30]  Oh, I want to drive the Ferrari or the Lamborghini.  It's like, could I fuck, let me see, a horse.  I'd like a horse tonight.  Is it stump broke?  You need a stump broke horse.  A horse that'll stand by a stump.  Yeah.  So you could climb up there, because horse pussies are pretty high up.  You've seen horse pussy?  Oh, yeah.  What does horse pussy look like?  It looks like a big pussy.  Like real?  Yeah.  It doesn't look like an asshole?  No, it looks like a pussy. 
[03:40:00]  It's a big slit.  It's a big slit.  And when they piss, horses kind of slowly spread their legs apart.  They do that thing.  And then they go back and arch their back a little.  And then a fucking waterfall comes out of this pussy.  Really?  This horse pussy.  And it's all pink inside.  Now, it would probably, like, I can't even imagine, because there's got to be no tightness  on it whatsoever.  It's a horse pussy.  It's used to a horse cock.  Yeah.  And you're sticking your little fucking, your little human dick in there.  Yeah.  So I don't know who's getting satisfied with that. 
[03:40:30]  Does it look sexy, though?  Um, no.  Besides the fact that it's on a horse?  No.  There's nothing sexy about it.  But it looks like a pussy.  Horse shit falls right out of the top.  Of the pussy?  That's right.  There's a horse pussy, see?  That's a horse pussy?  Yeah, isn't it like that?  Dude, don't even get me going with that.  You could fuck me.  Yeah, I know.  I know what it looks like, all right?  Dude.  Yeah, all right.  Let's just keep it all quiet.  Are you kidding me?  But look.  Look at that pussy.  That's horse pussy.  Dude.  Would you fuck that, Jim?  That's horse pussy?  That's not horse pussy. 
[03:41:00]  That's horse pussy.  Come on, let me see horse pussy a little more.  Horse pussy looks a lot like regular pussy.  Get out the fuck out.  Well, depending on.  Horse pussy smells better, I'm sure.  It has a smarter head on the end of it.  Oh, shit.  Why did Homeless Charlie do what he did?  Wow.  My God.  That is.  Are you kidding me?  See, you could probably.  That's a pretty tight fucking horse pussy.  I think that's pony pussy.  Really?  I think that's Shetland pony pussy.  And what's this? 
[03:41:30]  That's asshole.  But shouldn't that be.  Wait.  No.  Wait.  I'm confused.  Horse pussy is below asshole.  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  I gotcha.  Well, this should.  If it was.  And then the tail is above a horse asshole.  Well, if this was human, then this would be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little.  Okay.  Horse pussy.  Up and under.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look up horse pussy online.  Only Danny could fucking find a picture of a guy holding open a horse pussy as quickly 
[03:42:00]  as he did.  I don't.  What do you want to look at?  A closed one?  No.  I want the stretched open one.  That's what I'm saying.  It's fantastic.  You got to see the pink.  Like, that's what penthouse taught all of us.  Oh.  One in the pink.  One in the real, real stink.  I got to be honest with you.  I don't mind horse pussy.  Yeah?  If it's presented that way.  It's not like, it's not as disgusting as some.  Find some other animal's pussy.  Find me goat pussy.  You know, it would, it would, it would, it would be my luck that I decide to have sex 
[03:42:30]  with horse pussy.  Yeah.  And because the asshole is like, like, and they shit a lot.  Right above it and they shit.  Oh, you know.  Imagine a horse shitting on a shaft to your dick while you're trying to enjoy horse pussy.  Right when you're cumming, just ruins the whole thing by shitting all over, getting  green apple splatters all over your fucking dick.  And the fucking lot, the giant block of shit would hit your dick and split in half and  fall, your dick would act like a ginsu for horse shit.  You're trying to fuck it.  His tail is all up, brush on your chest, shit smell all over. 
[03:43:00]  You're feeling like a ridiculous.  Now you feel silly.  You're going to fall off the little ladder you're standing on.  Hey, we got to, uh, let's say hi to Dave.  Mr. Ed, you're on the line.  Well, he's got a horse pussy story.  Ah.  Is this comedy talk or entertainment?  No, this is more in the family and health section.  Family and health, right.  Yeah, we're now a family and health show.  Uh, what do you got, Dave?  Hey, listen, me and a guy, uh, me and a pal of mine used to go horseback riding a lot  up in Sussex County, New Jersey. 
[03:43:30]  Go up there, smoke a couple joints, run the horses.  We go up there one morning, we're baked.  Sitting there watching the old 70-year-old guy saddle the horses for us.  When one of these horses, like Anthony said, spread its leg and unleashed a waterfall.  As soon as it's done, it starts winking at us and pushing out the last couple drops.  Horse pussy twitches like you won't believe after it pisses.  The whole pussy goes, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.  It was winking at us.  We're laughing.  And spits.  Really?  It's great. 
[03:44:00]  We're laughing uncontrollably.  And, uh, the old 70-year-old dude looks at us and says, what's the matter with you?  You ain't never seen a horse take a leak before?  Uncontrollable laughter.  Punching out, fellas.  Because the horse pussy twitches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's real sexy.  Wonderful.  Ah.  That's goat pussy.  Sure is.  See?  Can I see that?  Yeah, right there.  Wow, goat pussy.  Goat pussy is, um...  Let me look at goat pussy.  Looks like a fucking bird's mouth.  Looks a little like, uh...  Let me see.  Yeah.  No.  That's tight as shit, though. 
[03:44:30]  I'm more into horse pussy.  Yeah, you like horse pussy better than goat pussy?  Well, what do you think?  I don't know.  Until I see some pig pussy, Danny.  Show me pig pussy.  He ain't gonna find pig pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just gonna punch up some pictures of girls that have been on our show.  I know.  Well...  As we look for pig pussies...  Okay, so they bring a bunch of different animals to sex meetings at rented premises.  At one meeting in a small village in... 
[03:45:00]  Small...  Five men waited for a woman who had promised to bring along two dogs.  But when she was unable to make it to the meeting,  the men spoke instead of their experiences,  including a previous visit to a colleague they referred to as Donkey Man.  What does Donkey Man do?  He has a goat and a couple of donkeys.  We tried with a donkey, but it didn't work.  But we did have sex with a goat, one of the men told this newspaper.  Except for them.  Previous calls for a law banning...  Wait.  Oh, there's pig pussy, of course. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, God.  Ugh.  That's locked.  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Previous calls for a law banning sex with animals have fallen on deaf ears.  Agriculture Minister Eskil...  Outraged many observers earlier this year with the graphic defense of existing animal abuse laws,  in which he presented examples of the difficulties faced by courts  when trying to differentiate affection from abuse.  Ah.  Is it, and should it be, legal to spread something on the genitalia 
[03:46:00]  that might smell or taste nice to a dog  in order to allow the dog to lick off whatever's spread on the genitalia?  You're giving them...  All the dog knows is, mmm, that tastes good.  It doesn't think...  What do you think?  The dog sits there and whimpers in the corner  because it thinks you're abusing it?  It has no clue.  You just gave it some tasty peanut butter.  Right.  That's all it knows.  The little treat at the end.  The minister continues, he says,  Should it be permitted to stroke a bitch's teats with love 
[03:46:30]  or should it be classified as animal sexual abuse?  That's just crazy.  Yeah, that's good.  That's crazier than fucking it.  If you fuck a dog, that's pretty crazy.  Right.  But if you're just, like, playing with its tits,  that's worse than fucking the dog.  I submit to you.  It kind of goes back to that gay argument.  Right, right.  The guy's having sex or the guy's kissing.  The kissing.  It's like kissing is worse to watch  than guys just slamming each other.  The kissing is more disturbing.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Like, if you're cuddling with your dog  and fucking squeezing its tits,  that just makes you laugh more than fucking it.  So that story is wonderful today.  Hello.  Who's saying that?  What if you deep mouth kiss your dog?  Yeah.  Just making out with your dog.  I hate people that let their dogs kiss them.  Lick their face.  I hate that.  Look, I'm getting kisses.  My friend Deez.  It was just kissing its balls, asshole. 
[03:47:30]  They were just licking their asshole.  Exactly.  Just licked the asshole.  Cut the middleman out.  Yeah.  Right.  Right for that fucking little puckered dog asshole.  Oh, with little fucking flakes of shit still on it.  Dogs don't wipe.  No, they're silly.  It's just dirty.  All right.  I want to flick a dog's asshole.  Like, just right in the little hole,  I just want to take my finger and go.  Oh, would he scoot away?  Here's what he would do.  His tail would tuck under his legs.  His rear legs, both at a time, would go forward,  and he'd look back with that face. 
[03:48:00]  He'd be shocked that you just flicked his little asshole.  Because dog fingers don't do that.  No.  Dogs can't flick because they don't have that opposable thumb to store the energy in the other finger with.  Danny, Thanksgiving right around the corner, they're requesting turkey pussy.  Turkey pussy.  Turkey pussy?  As we get into the end of the day.  I don't know if you could really look at a bird pussy.  Why not?  I'm having trouble finding a...  Maybe again, pussy.  Pig pussy?  I just keep finding pictures of Britney Spears getting out of cars.  Ah, there you go. 
[03:48:30]  Really?  Pig oopsies.  That's got to make them feel good.  Yeah, only mammals have real pussies.  I don't know.  The horse pussy.  That's a mammal.  No, I know, but that was pretty impressive.  That's pretty pussy-like.  What about whale pussy?  Or dolphin pussy?  Give us more pussy.  Whale pussy, dolphin pussy, all kinds of pussy.  What's wrong with the pussy we got?  Apple pie pussy.  It's pretty good.  Line of the day.  I know it's WebEx, right? 
[03:49:00]  It is.  You can hold meetings from home.  You don't have to go to work.  No.  Hold your meetings at home.  Well, you don't have to travel.  That's cool, too, sometimes.  Just put on the top half of your suit and do the meeting like that while you jack it.  While you're in your boxers.  Yeah, WebEx.  Hold meetings.  Make presentations.  Do it from the comfort of your own home.  That's beautiful.  Or your office, so you don't have to take the business trip.  WebEx.com.  Check it out for yourself.  Indeed.  All right, as you look for pussy, we're going to do the first runner-up line of the day. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, I bet it's nothing but spitting the whole time.  Spitting.  Spit, spit, spit.  Too much friction.  Spit, spit, spit.  Oh, God.  Nice.  Well handled.  She was probably the worst fuck.  She's horrible.  Yeah.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  It'll wear off.  It's, again, it's a weird thing for all of us.  No, that doesn't wear off.  It's permanent.  I always get so confused on this program. 
[03:50:00]  I don't know what people are talking about.  Bird shit and piss out of the same hole?  Yes.  What's wrong with them?  Everything.  They're just fucking scared little fags.  Yeah, but they're not pissing out of their pussy.  Their eggs drop out of their pussy, I would believe.  Little bird pussy.  Do birds shit out of their pussies?  No, they shit out of their ass, but they piss out of it, too.  And they have the little bird eggs come out of their bird pussy.  Right.  So if you're licking a bird pussy, are you going to taste shit or not? 
[03:50:30]  You probably would.  That's all I need to know.  Yeah, it's all crappy back there and feathers.  Cat pussy?  You had a cat.  How's cat pussy?  Well, when they're in heat, they make those noises, and they shove your foot right under  the tail, and they go,  And then you touch right under their tail with your shoe, and they go,  It's really sick. 
[03:51:00]  And a little trickle of blood.  Ew, why?  After you fuck them.  No, they do actually have a little trickle of discharge that comes out.  Cats love dick.  When they're, um, they do.  Yeah.  Before they're, like, a spade.  Before you get a female cat's spade.  Oh.  They'll discharge blood and fucking...  All night long.  Let's say hi to John in Missouri. 
[03:51:30]  John, what's up?  Good evening.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Ordered your book.  Ain't got it yet, but I can't wait to read it.  I hope you like it, man.  Thank you.  Um, I worked on a farm when I was younger, and...  Yeah, big fucking whoop.  Farm.  Thank you, man.  Um, no, I worked on a farm when I was younger, and I had to, uh, pull out a dead calf out  of a cow.  Oh.  And I had both arms up to my elbows in a cow's pussy. 
[03:52:00]  That was kind of weird.  Oh, what the hell.  Yeah, no.  Here, smell my arms.  Well, the, uh, veterinarians, when they're checking, uh, if a horse is pregnant, and how far along  it is, and if everything's okay, they actually put a big glove on, up, way over their, their  elbow, and, uh, they shove their arm up the horse's ass.  Not E-rock.  An actual horse's ass.  Bleh.  And then, uh, and then they feel around through the intestine. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  And feel it, and then pull it out, and their arm is just covered with horse shit.  Just do.  I guess, I guess if they put it in the, uh, the a-pulsa, it would, um, it would hurt the  little sack and everything else, so they'd do it through the asshole.  One of my old, uh, friends from Geneseo, he would get sprayed by horse cum.  That was his job.  What?  What lottery did he win?  Yeah, what videos are.  His job.  Man, you do what you can to get a few bucks when you're in college, and he, he found a 
[03:53:00]  job, and I'm not joking, he would leave the house with, uh, like, rain shit on, rain slicker  crap.  I think Gorton's a Glosser fisherman.  Very similar to that.  Yeah.  It was his uniform for his job, and his whole job was to get the horse dick into the horse  pussy.  Ah, so you gotta guide it in like a fucking torpedo into torpedo tube.  Yeah, they were mating horses or what have you, and that was his whole job, and they  get so fucking excited, and they shoot so early that he, he would be just jizzed on all the 
[03:53:30]  time.  Why would they have to do it?  Because I, I remember, uh, mating, mating horses, uh, when I was in California, and they would  do it themselves.  Like, we'd put them in the stall, we wanted this horse to get pregnant, we put, we put  this, uh, one Appaloosa into this stall with the horse, the horse's name was Concho Pete.  Nice.  Concho Pete had a fucking cock that was giant.  Giant.  And, uh, the head of Concho Pete's cock had to be the size of, like, a Volkswagen hubcap. 
[03:54:00]  And, uh, it was giant.  And, uh, would mount the, uh, the, the mare and just shove that thing home.  And, really, just deep.  You wonder how the horse could even take it.  He just buried it.  And then for two seconds, and then it would pull out, and it's still spraying cum all over  the place.  That's what I'm saying.  It just, it shot a load inside, but then it also shoots loads everywhere.  I don't know, because I, I haven't talked to this guy in a really long time, but I don't  remember, but I think that was the problem that, you know, he wasn't staying inside, so 
[03:54:30]  he gets, gets the juice in there.  So, you know, the damn thing's pulling out too early, and the shit's flying out, so his  whole job is to either guide it in or make sure it's stayed in.  It's like turning around and cumming in the horse's face.  How much did your friend make?  $50,000 a week?  Just an insane job this kid had.  And he would just, like, get in his uniform, and we would laugh our horses off.  It was a dumb weekend job.  You know what's cool?  When I, when I was out, out in California, these girls had horses also down at the stable, 
[03:55:00]  and they were, they were, like, my age, 14, 13, 14, 15 years old, and they'd have these  horses, and they'd have to clean the horse's sheath and dick.  So, like, it was hot to watch these girls with this giant horse cock in their hand, just  washing the horse's cock with, like, a sponge and shit.  They would just have the cock in their hand?  They'd have the cock in their hand, and they're washing the horse's cock, and I'm just watching 
[03:55:30]  this thing like, this is so fucking hot.  Right.  Like, and it wasn't even in a bestiality way.  It was just that this girl has a cock in her hand, and I'm just watching this girl with  a big dick in her hand.  Yeah.  Horse dick.  It is great, isn't it?  Prep that bull.  Yes.  Scrub that cock.  I gotta make a phone call, Lopey.  Yeah, we're, we're kinda heading to the end anyway.  Yeah.  Let me say goodbye to everybody.  I gotta call our pals in Seattle.  Bye-bye, Jimmy.  Say hi to BJ.  Hi, Jimmy.  And I'll see some of y'all motherfuckers at Barnes & Noble tonight at 7 on Richmond Avenue, 
[03:56:00]  and some of y'all motherfuckers tomorrow night at Borders and motherfucking Providence at 6.  You just gotta go away and jerk off after hearing all this sexy talk.  I sure do.  All these lucky jobs these guys have had.  Oh, what do I got?  Here it is.  Look at this.  What is this?  Here's a woman who's gonna just take a big load of horse jizz in her face.  Why?  Come on, now.  Why would you do this?  Why wouldn't you?  Here we go.  Look, it's freezing up.  This is no time to buffer.  Don't buffer. 
[03:56:30]  It's buffering.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's good.  That's looped, but I love it.  It just takes that whole look.  What the fuck?  Classic.  I've got old 60s footage of people laughing.  Yeah, find Danny and he'll tell you where that was, where he found that, I mean.  All right, Larry in Pennsylvania.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, I got the name for your buddy's job.  It's a heeva hava.  A heeva hava?  A heeva hava.  We always use the term down here in Pennsylvania for, you know, any just douchebag, but that's 
[03:57:00]  the name of the job.  All right.  Well, thank you.  I'm kind of accurate because it's been a long time, but basically the job is to make sure  what?  It stays in there?  Yeah.  Insertion.  I don't know the full detail.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yep.  Do we have another runner-up line of the day?  If we do, hit it.  No?  Organic fruits and vegetables look like a sick kid.  Terrible.  Just a sick kid.  Yeah, they do. 
[03:57:30]  The color is off.  Nah, whatever.  All right.  I think we did everything right.  Yes!  Dolphins are one of only animals who have sex for pleasure.  Oh, how do you know?  Would you let a dolphin rub one out on you?  No.  I hear they like doing that, though, to girls.  They like it a lot.  Yeah.  You hear the stories.  Yeah, people that swim with the dolphins, they get molested sometimes by the dolphins.  But for a goof, would you let that happen?  No.  Why?  Because I'm not into any other animal. 
[03:58:00]  No, I'm not saying you're doing it because you're into it, just as a goof.  No.  No.  Yeah, I don't think so.  That's like a dog humping your leg.  You shake it off immediately.  You're like, get out of here.  Yeah.  That was creepy.  It is the funniest fucking looking thing when it does it to somebody else, though.  But that was creepy when you were younger and you didn't know what the dog was trying  to accomplish.  It's like a...  And your parents...  Got that stupid face on.  And the parents were always horrified and you didn't know why they were horrified.  You were just a kid.  Get down!  Thinking the dog wants to play with you?  Yeah. 
[03:58:30]  I walked in the room to see my younger brothers getting all out humped.  Oh, Jesus.  And, you know...  And their face?  Huh?  Face humped?  No, just...  Oh.  Just...  And the dog is just having its way with my little brothers.  And us older boys, or my dad or my mom would, thank God, discover that this is not a good  situation and get the dog off the kid.  The little lad.  I know a guy who fucked a cat.  Dolphins are...  That's a little... 
[03:59:00]  That's a little...  That's kind of a little dick.  I don't know.  Do we want to do more radio?  Nah, we gotta go.  Yeah, good point.  Line of the day.  Here...  Here...  Comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Men without hats?  That's right.  I prefer old ladies without hats.  Yes.  That's my favorite.  I'd like to hear that tune.  Yeah. 
[03:59:30]  Yes.  I can punch you if I want to.  You could leave your hat behind.  Your hat ain't paid for, and it ain't paid for.  But I'm gonna knock you on your old behind.  And, and, and, and...  There's a little improv stand-up for you.  Yeah.  All right. 
[04:00:00]  All right.  Um...  I'm fascinated with horse pussy, by the way.  I gotta tell you.  Yeah, who wouldn't be?  It's fantastic stuff.  I had no idea.  Oh, is this kid gonna get humped by him?  That's what I mean.  Ah, the kid's leaning over an ottoman trying to play his video games, and the dog is just  humping him.  Yeah, it's called dog humps, kid playing Wii.  And the, and the kid is just helpless at this point.  Who's videoing this?  Thank you.  That's about...  Arrest that person.  That's what I was about to say.  Drop the camera and save your kid.  He's losing this fight.  At least give the dog some oven mitts. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, now the dog turned the kid over.  Not good.  Now it's not fun anymore.  I remember seeing that as a kid, though.  Yeah.  You know, my little brothers didn't know any better.  You know, they're getting attacked and humped by the family dog.  Dog knows, though.  Ugh.  Creepy that, that the dog has those thoughts.  I know.  Just, you know, you see something on all fours.  It doesn't know.  What the fuck does it know with the dog?  To you, it's stupid Fido.  To the dog, you know, he wants to get something.  Something to fuck.  Right.  All right, guys. 
[04:01:00]  Thank you so much, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  You know, tomorrow.  Hang on.  Powers are out.  Hang on.  That's an hour.  See you tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  See you tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, all right.  Goodbye.  I thought I'd call.  Ding-dong.  Bye.  Hello?  Who's in here?  Hello? 
[04:01:30]  Ding-dong.  Let's get the fuck out of here. </pre>
